<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a segment focused on listeners' and hosts' early sexual experiences and misconceptions.  Fred from Augusta, Georgia, recounted his first sexual encounter at 12. Anthony then shared a graphic account of his first time at 13 with a 19-year-old woman, "Buzz," details of which were further embellished by his brother, Joe, who called in and also described his own simultaneous sexual encounter with a 32-year-old woman at the same location. Joe also discussed his and Anthony's upbringing and their move back to New York.  Tony, another caller, described a regrettable nine-hour drive to meet a significantly overweight woman for sex, focusing on anal sex. Opie concluded the segment with a story about a disappointing date with a woman he met on a CB radio, "Dreamweaver," contrasting his expectations with reality.

The next segment started with a humorous story about a disastrous date involving a horse ride, with the host comparing the woman to the difference between Barbie Benton and Kirstie Alley.  This was followed by a highly contentious phone call with Kenny from San Jose, during which the hosts used homophobic slurs and graphic sexual language to mock Kenny's criticism of their lack of structured skits and his comedic preferences.  The conversation then shifted to 9/11 commemorative coins, the hosts expressing disgust at their exploitative nature. One host described destroying a vendor's display near Ground Zero.  Caller Tad provided further details about the coins. The discussion touched upon profiting from tragedy, referencing Andrea Yates and Elizabeth Taylor.  The segment concluded with discussion of Earl's failed attempt to pitch a radio show ("Black Rock Coalition") to XM Satellite Radio, including audio clips and a call from Earl himself, who discussed his current work and job insecurity.  A "stoner spelling bee" with high callers from Jersey and D.C. concluded the segment, featuring crude humor and off-color jokes.  PJ from D.C., Brian in Jersey, Andy from New York, Steve in Jersey, and Tim in Jersey participated, with Steve in Jersey winning.

The following segment continued with the "Stoner Spelling Bee," focusing on callers' marijuana use and associated anecdotes, often involving their families and crude language.  Comedian Jeffrey Ross then joined the studio.  The hosts and Ross discussed various unrealized radio bit ideas, including "Feels for Meals," "Run Around Park Aaron," and a bee-themed segment. They discussed profanity, sexually suggestive humor, and Ross's experiences at celebrity roasts, including interactions with Penny Marshall. A call from Chris in Jersey about a midget encountered during a hernia operation followed. The segment introduced Francine, a former intern and stand-up comedian, with a brief playback of her set.

Francine's comedy set, targeting fat people, herself, and Spanish people, was reviewed by the hosts and Ross. Ross recounted a broken hip sustained while ice skating and a knife incident at Pratt Institute. The show promoted Ross's upcoming shows, discussed Opie's avoidance of a dinner with his agent, Bob Eatman, and Jim Norton's contrasting behavior in professional social settings. A planned contest for World Series tickets, based on a previous disgusting Boston Clam Chowder segment, was announced.

The final segment began with a discussion of disgusting pornography, specifically those involving defecation and vomiting, contrasted with solitary masturbation.  The conversation shifted to an aversion to snot, sparked by a story about a mistress blowing her nose into her lover's mouth.  One host detailed unsanitary habits of an individual. The main focus became a story about Bob's wife, Robin, and a persistent, unnamed admirer who was emailing and calling her despite her disinterest and Bob’s disapproval.  The hosts debated the situation, Robin's naiveté, and the admirer's increasingly inappropriate behavior. Multiple callers, many truck drivers, shared stories of infidelity, often using crude and sexually explicit language. One caller described engaging in double anal fisting. The segment concluded with reflections on infidelity, methods of discovery, including spyware and hidden cameras, and a call describing a successful confrontation at a wedding that stopped further contact with the caller's wife.

[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Good morning to you. 
[00:04:30]  We've got to go right to the phones.  Talking about the first time you jacked it, I guess.  Yeah, we were kind of talking about that, weren't we?  I don't know how we got on that subject because of the guy listening to the Sacramento couple yesterday.  Right, right.  Okay, gotcha.  Let's say hi to Fred.  Hey, Fred, where are you calling from, man?  I'm calling from Augusta, Georgia right now.  Okay.  You got a story for us?  Yes, sir.  I remember, I'm 50 years old, so give me that to a bit.  I remember the days when we were with my mom.  We had a Simpson Sears catalog, and that's where you're jerking off to. 
[00:05:00]  So I remember the first time I got late.  Slow down, slow down, slow down.  What?  A what catalog?  A Simpson Sears catalog.  I'm from Canada, so it's a Sears catalog.  A Sears catalog that you would jack it to.  Yeah, I'm used to jack it to the pictures of the girls in bras.  In the bras?  Yeah, that was porno back then when you were like, I don't know, 10.  Kind of was.  You'd have to look through the circulars and find.  Oh, yeah, you'd get that.  Or the before and after bikini ads.  The before and after pictures in the back of some of those teen magazines.  Really?  That my older sister had, where you put this cream on your... 
[00:05:30]  The jacket to the fat chicks on the before?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It's even better, actually.  I mean, that would be a funny story, too.  But they used to have in the back of these magazines a breast cream.  Oh, right.  Remember the breast cream?  Yes.  Where supposedly the teenage girls were supposed to put this cream on their boobs.  And their boobs would get bigger.  And they'd show the before and after picture, and then you would buy this product as a teenage girl  not knowing that it's actually puberty that's making them bigger and not their stupid cream. 
[00:06:00]  All right.  So the Sears catalog, you used a jacket to that?  Yeah.  So it gives you that type of idea.  I remember when I was 12 years old, I was in grade 8.  And I wanted to get laid so bad because I was jerking off and I didn't want to know how it felt like.  So I finally found this girl in grade 8 who wanted to do it with me.  So she was like a wooden floor.  So that was great.  Of course she had a wooden floor.  Nothing was happening down there yet.  That's right.  So I thought all I had to do was stick it between her legs and I'd be having sex with her. 
[00:06:30]  So we got on the floor in her bedroom and then I stuck it between her legs.  I remember it was too dry.  And all I thought, well, I just had to stick it between her legs.  So I told her to squeeze her legs tighter so I could get it in there.  And it wouldn't go in.  So I had to go down and spit in there, right?  Oh, my God.  Only in Georgia.  No surprise here.  Wait.  Were you having sex with her or were you having sex with her legs? 
[00:07:00]  No, I was having sex with her.  Okay.  The point was I didn't know what I was doing.  I thought I just had to stick it between her legs but not in her hole.  You see?  Yeah.  So all I did was I spit in the hole and it got nice and greasy then.  Then I got in there and I fucked her.  All right.  Jesus.  Then our parents came home.  Then I found out years later that there wasn't sex at all.  I had to screw it between her legs.  I didn't put it in the hole at all.  All right.  Thank you, Fred.  You scare me. 
[00:07:30]  That is a frightening man.  All right.  There goes Fred.  You are frightening.  We could salvage that call, though.  There are things when you're a kid that you think is sex.  Misconceptions about sex that you do have.  So to that guy, I think he wasn't sure you were supposed to, as he said, put it in the...  You know, I'm not even going to say it.  I mean, come on.  Let's keep it a little clean on this show.  It sounded so nice and innocent the way he told the story, didn't it?  But I...  Ah, fuck!  Right.  I think what he was trying to say, back then he thought having sex was just when you... 
[00:08:00]  Oh, no.  He didn't know, but he ended up having sex with her legs.  Opie, I have no idea what that guy was talking about.  I'm really trying to save that phone call.  Somehow he had sex with the girl's legs and didn't actually do it, but he thought he was  doing it.  But I don't know if he knew what actually doing it was.  He wasn't very clear.  He was laughing too hard at his memories.  Right.  Well, I talked about this in the past.  I thought, yeah, I thought you had to do it in the back door and that the other one, 
[00:08:30]  the front one was just used for what, you know.  And when did you figure it out the real way?  Last week?  Pretty much, yeah.  All the girlfriends were like, ow!  No, it was after the film, obviously.  Like, oh, oh, that's used for two things.  Well, you're not too clear on the female parts because you don't have them.  So you're not sure.  You have the back, so you kind of know what that's about.  So you assume... 
[00:09:00]  You know what?  I think we're going to just do a sex show today, I decided.  Is it completely a sex show?  Because you guys try to tell us what you want to hear on this program.  Now we're going to just do sex all day long.  Sexual discussion, and then we have sex on the couch.  Didn't you have something similar?  What you thought was sex when you were a lot younger?  Yeah, I thought it was back door when I was a kid.  I guess I was about maybe seven.  And I thought it was back door.  And then when I learned that it was front door...  All right, so you thought it was back door as well. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, yeah.  All right, I'm not alone.  You're not sure of the anatomy.  So, you know, you don't even know that there's anything different up there in a girl.  Well, when you're really young and you see the front one...  Yeah.  It's intimidating and quite scary.  Very intimidating indeed.  And when you and I were growing up, you know, women weren't really taking care of that area.  No, no.  It was a big, jungly mess.  So you couldn't even imagine that was the way to go.  Yeah.  You know?  You just couldn't imagine. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, no.  It was very frightening.  It was very frightening.  Frightening.  I was brought into it.  Mom, turn the radio off, okay?  Don't listen.  Because it's embarrassing.  Yeah, because we need Anthony to not have to worry about his mom listening.  It's embarrassing talking about, you know...  My mom, it's hilarious.  I was listening today.  I had to turn you guys off.  Well, I'm like...  Oh, that's what mine says, too.  That's fine.  She called last night.  She's like, yeah, I listen, you know, but there are times I just have to turn it off.  It's like, oh, boy. 
[00:10:30]  You know, whatever.  A 65-year-old woman is really the demo we're looking for.  So, no, turn it off.  That's what, you know...  Of course you're not going to like some of the stuff we're doing.  Especially when you consider it's me telling the stories.  What didn't she like yesterday?  The poker chips?  Um, no, she actually didn't listen yesterday, but there have been things that...  Whenever we talk about things like this, she doesn't like to listen, which is good.  Don't listen.  When I was a kid and kind of got hooked up through my father in California, my father kind of hooked me up with this girl. 
[00:11:00]  He hooked you up with a lot of girls.  On my, uh...  I guess it was my 13th birthday or something like that.  Yeah.  Is this the Buzz story?  Yeah, Buzz.  Old Buzz.  She was a friend of the family.  She was, like, 19 years old.  I guess she had banged everybody that we even knew.  Everybody in the town?  Yeah.  She was like the town whore.  Was she really?  The town whore.  You never said that before.  Yeah, she banged everybody.  Was she just a local chick in the bar?  She was banging all my father's horse friends, you know, that would go riding with him and stuff. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, your dad was a cowboy after he left Long Island.  He was a cowboy.  He said, screw Long Island.  I'm going to California and I'm going to be a cowboy, baby.  Bought a bunch of horses.  I went out there.  Lived out there with him.  Bought me a horse.  I had a horse.  The whole deal, Opie.  I was a Western guy.  I wore cowboy boots and the cowboy hat.  I was a cowboy.  It was pretty funny.  Had a six gun.  Sure.  A real one? 
[00:12:00]  A real one.  Bought it for me for, also, I guess, my 12th birthday.  Got me that.  Got me a rifle.  How long did you live out there?  I thought you were just visiting.  14, 15, maybe three or four years.  Oh, you did three or four years out there.  Yeah, three or four years.  I thought you just used to visit.  My formative years.  Because I know your mom threw you and your brother on the bus one day.  No, that was actually coming home.  I moved out there because I wanted to move out there.  I wanted to hang out with my father and ride horses. 
[00:12:30]  It's a kid's dream to be a cowboy.  My brother got thrown out there by my mother because she didn't want to deal with his pot smoking.  My brother's pot smoking, stealing and lying.  Stealing my mommy's quarters out of the quarter jar to buy joints and lying about it.  So mommy threw him out.  So he went first?  No, I went first.  Oh, okay.  And then he joined you.  And then he joined me out there.  Gotcha.  He wasn't really into the whole cowboy thing, so he just smoked pot out there.  He was pretty much doing the same thing, only out there.  But you got into the cowboy lifestyle. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, I was totally into it.  I used to listen to the, like, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.  Like stuff you'd hear on Hank's Place.  I love Hank's Place.  I would listen to that.  That was my music.  If you guys haven't checked out Hank's Place yet on XF Solid Light Radio, I forgot what channel it is, but it's definitely worth checking out.  It's like either 10, 11, 12, or 13.  Oh, it's hysterical.  It's way up there, but Hank's Place rocks.  It's scary that people think like this in the country.  Oh, it's amazing.  In the country.  It's Red State Station.  Exactly.  Anyway, go ahead.  I was one of them. 
[00:13:30]  I love that music.  So, yeah, I was a cowboy.  And she was like the town whore, Buzz.  And one night, my father and his girlfriend at the time were going out and just kind of left Buzz there and kind of were smiling, like winking or something when they left.  I didn't know what was happening.  And you were 13, 12?  Yeah, I guess I was 13.  Was this for your birthday?  Yeah.  It was my birthday present.  And then Buzz goes, why don't you go upstairs and take a shower? 
[00:14:00]  I'm like, oh, okay.  Not thinking anything about it.  Well, I was riding my horse today.  I had cowboy dirt on me.  Okay.  I had cowboy dirt on me.  So I did, and I get out of the shower, and I'm ready to walk back downstairs and watch TV with Buzz.  And I hear from the bedroom, aren't you coming in?  Like, and no, it didn't even hit me at that point.  Yeah.  I'm just thinking, hmm, now what's the voice coming from in the bedroom? 
[00:14:30]  She was downstairs.  Now, why would she be, oh, and it finally hits you?  Oh, oh, oh.  You're like, this is it.  Oh, this is it.  Here it comes.  I'm going to put all that jack into good use.  Yeah.  So I heard, did you get an immediate boner?  Oh, yeah.  What are you kidding?  You get that whoosh feeling all over?  Well, that's the blood just rushing.  Here it comes.  Here comes that sex stuff.  And then I kind of peer around the corner, and I look in the bed, and this vision is just etched in my head. 
[00:15:00]  It's Buzz.  Is it still a really hot vision for you?  It's one of those nice little memories you have as a kid.  I remember seeing Buzz sitting in my bed.  Yeah.  But she's sitting up with her head and torso against the headboard.  Was she hot?  Be honest.  No, she was hot.  I've heard this story a couple times.  You know what it was? 
[00:15:30]  She wasn't fat at all, but she was a big girl, like tall and not skinny, but not fat.  And she had a huge can.  How much bigger was she than you?  It must have looked ridiculous.  Oh, okay.  Let's just put it that way.  I've never heard this part of the story, because you're 12, 13.  I was 13.  13.  Yeah.  You couldn't have weighed more than what, 110, 120 pounds?  I don't know.  I was a little more than that.  But, you know, it just must have looked ridiculous. 
[00:16:00]  All right.  And she was sitting up in the bed with the blanket, like, in her lap.  It just came up to her lap.  So her huge cans were sitting there, all milky white.  They were huge?  Oh, they were huge.  They were huge.  With nice blue veins.  They were just huge.  You can see the blood just pumping.  Boom, boom, translucent.  Pumping to the nipple.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  She was sitting there, and I looked in, 
[00:16:30]  and it was pretty much the first time I ever saw them real live.  You know, I've seen a lot of porno.  Yeah.  I had seen a lot of porno at that point.  And they sat up nice?  Yeah, because she was 19, you know.  Oh, okay, okay.  She was 19.  She was the older woman to me.  I know.  When you tell the story, I keep thinking, like, she was a 30-year-old woman.  No, no, no.  She was 19, and you were 13.  19.  All right, yeah.  And, yeah, she goes, well, why don't you come in?  I'm like, all right.  You know, I went in, and the rest is my history.  You know?  It just did happen. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, you want to stop the story right there?  Well, I knew what to do, so there's no real details.  How long did you last?  It wasn't that long.  How long?  Be honest.  I don't know.  A couple pumps?  Honestly, I would tell you, I really don't remember, but I remember kind of getting into it.  The first time you do it, it's...  Come on.  You know what, though?  You were drunk?  I had jacked it in the shower that I had just taken.  I had.  I had jacked it in the shower.  You were a jacking machine, man. 
[00:17:30]  A monkey!  I was like a monkey.  I swear to you.  A monkey.  So did you just do regular sex?  Yeah, but the point is, and how this got brought up with the intimidation factor of the vag when you first see it.  It's quite scary the first time you see it.  And, dude, this was...  And there's a lot of parts down there, and you're like, wow, what does all that do?  Oh, my God, I'm going to need a chart.  Right, give me a map.  You know, we had continued to have sex for months afterwards, you know?  Like, I was going to... 
[00:18:00]  She would show up at the house after my father and his girlfriend would leave in the mornings before school.  So I'm getting ready to go to school, and she would pop into my bed, and we'd have sex, and off I'd go to school.  Now, what's messed up, if it was a 19-year-old guy and a 13-year-old girl...  Yeah, I did get in trouble for that.  What?  Kidding.  Oh, okay.  You know, people wouldn't think that's cool.  Like, a guy hearing that, you know, hearing you tell the story that you're 13 banging a 19-year-old, that is a really cool story. 
[00:18:30]  Uh-huh.  Every guy dreamt that that could happen to them when they were growing up.  I told people at school, and they didn't believe me.  They thought I was just another one of their friends lying to them.  They're like, get out of here.  I'm like, no, really?  I just had sex.  Were you the first one to have...  It's not my finger.  Were you the first one to have sex?  Yeah, yeah.  And your group of friends?  Oh, yeah.  Must have.  That's, like, really young.  Uh-huh.  Wow.  But now, one of these sexual encounters before school, you know, she goes down on me, and it was just, you know, wee-hoo, boy, this is goody-goody, more fun than toys. 
[00:19:00]  And then she goes, would you like to do this to me?  Oh, no.  And, dude, I am talking.  She wasn't that old.  Crank this up, baby.  Oh, she wasn't that old.  19.  Still a teen in the name.  Still a teen.  Not a nasty Mrs. Robinson. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, like I'm banging Dean Warmer's wife.  Those pointy tits in her bra.  This music's playing in your head.  No.  As she pulls down her huge panties.  Yeah, I pulled down her huge.  She did have big 70s panties.  Like, you know the ones that just are not cut at all of the legs?  Yeah.  Just big bloomers.  Those are the ones.  Let me step out of my bloomers. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  And it had to be a mess, because this was like the 70s, right?  Kick the, yeah.  Late 70s, maybe?  Kicks the bloomers over the lamp, and the whole room goes dark.  Or big bloomers.  So she goes, would you like to do this to me?  Would you like to do this to me?  And the only vision I had was the vision I saw of it before I, you know, put it in.  So I remembered what it looked like very vividly.  What did it look like?  Come on.  Dude, it was, it was as if you had punched Fidel Castro in the mouth, and his lips swelled up. 
[00:20:30]  And knocked out all his teeth.  Yeah.  That's what it looked like.  It looked like Albert Einstein with a head wound.  It was awful.  Big.  And there was a couple shots of Novocaine in the lips.  Yeah, yeah.  Like he was going for dentistry.  And the hair was spread out so far, like past the area.  She had like leg hair on that. 
[00:21:00]  It was giant.  Thank God you just don't see that these days.  You just don't.  You know?  You don't, thank God.  She was used to grow.  I don't know, man.  Maybe we were brought up as cavemen in some other era.  Because it used to grow like halfway down their thighs.  Down the thighs, man.  Does it even grow like that anymore?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  Girls are less hairy, more gooder now.  But know what the problem is?  All these styles come back.  That style will come back.  You think?  Before our time is done on this earth.  I don't think so.  We are going to have to deal with that again. 
[00:21:30]  I'm telling you.  I don't think so.  I'm telling you.  That's like the Hitler mustache.  Not down there, but the Hitler mustache on your face.  I never see that coming back again.  I'm telling you, man.  It's going to come back.  All right, so.  She sat on the edge of the bed one time, naked.  And when she was sitting and her lap, you know, her leg, she was bent at the waist because  she's sitting.  It looked like she was wearing black furry panties.  Her pubes were just so stretched out.  I can't imagine girls were getting a lot of oral back then.  Yeah, I know. 
[00:22:00]  I can't imagine.  Because now today, you know, most of the girls are completely shaved.  But just think of the hairy mess when they did.  Big Burt Reynolds mustache and pork chop sideburns going down on a chick with a rug in her lap.  Just a big hairy mess all around.  Oh, cavemen.  Yeah, that went on for years.  So did you do it?  Until I left back to.  No.  I went.  How did you get out of it?  She goes, would you mind doing this to me?  And I just went, I don't think so. 
[00:22:30]  I did.  I said, I don't think so.  She knew I was a rookie.  So then what happened?  I'm not ready to go for the big league.  So what happened then?  We just continued having regular sex.  Yeah.  You know, she didn't cut me off from it.  That's great, man.  I guess she understood.  You're going to eighth grade getting banged every morning.  That's amazing.  You know, it was pretty odd.  It's amazing, man.  And then girls my own age, I was like, you know, geez, this chick don't know shit. 
[00:23:00]  She doesn't even have.  Can you help a brother out?  She doesn't even have boobs yet.  I'm like, hey, would you mind doing this to me?  And they go, I don't think so.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  Wow, that's funny, man.  Yeah.  Oh, Hank's Place is Channel 13.  Good.  Channel 13.  Let me see if Ozzy could, that's a great story, by the way, Anthony.  More details.  It was greater to live, Opie.  More details.  And then the next day, I got in the truck with my dad. 
[00:23:30]  He was driving me to school.  And he kind of just looks over and goes, so, how was last night?  That's a cool dad, man.  For my 13th birthday, I got a 10-speed bike.  Wouldn't it be fun to know what you know now?  You got a hooker.  You basically got a hooker.  Well, it wasn't a money thing.  Did your dad bang it, too?  Probably.  Who knows?  Probably compare notes.  Yeah, dad.  Nice snatch.  What was that?  Yeah, now it kind of threw me.  Yes. 
[00:24:00]  How was last night?  Oh, if you knew what you know now, like what I could have come back with, it's like, so,  how was last night?  And go, oh, dad, I don't like girls.  You know, thanks for the effort and stuff, but I really don't like girls.  Yeah.  Man, that's...  Freak them out.  Yeah, that's unbelievable.  Yeah, I was like, wow, no, it was, you know, it was cool.  It was good.  You had the coolest dad in school.  You and Anthony, XM202.  Your brother wants in on the conversation.  Oh, yeah?  About you and Buzz when you were a kid, Anthony. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, let's see.  Out there in California.  Let's see what Joe's going to add.  Brother Joe, Anthony's brother, of course.  Joey!  Joe!  Joe!  Hey, what's up, man?  You're on the air.  Yeah.  What the hell happened?  What's up?  What the hell's wrong with you?  Nothing, man.  I was just getting gas.  I'm on my way back from Atlantic City.  Oh, you're getting gas?  Okay.  Yeah, I'm coming back from Atlantic City.  I just saw Tom Jones.  Oh, how was that?  It was cool, man. 
[00:25:00]  Did he do dry vagina?  A bunch of goddamn old...  No, a bunch of old ladies, though.  It was hysterical, man.  They're, like, throwing these big old bloomers up at us.  Do they still throw their underwear at that guy?  Oh, it's hysterical, man.  Oh, I love Joe.  Joe, you have a great life now, man.  You don't have to get up early to do that.  Oh, Joe just cruises around the world.  He's just doing his band thing and going to see Tom Jones concerts.  See Tom Jones, because he can now.  How does Tom Jones sound, Joe?  Things are good.  You guys have made it that way for me. 
[00:25:30]  Thank you very much.  What's Tom Jones sound like?  Any good?  Dry, dry.  Was that a Tom Jones song originally?  Yeah.  The guy sounded incredible.  Yeah, he was really good, man.  Still has his pipes.  Great show.  Dad hasn't lost a thing.  Wow, very cool.  Hasn't lost a thing.  I got to go check him out.  It's pretty fun.  Well, anyway, I'm calling to talk about Buzz for a second.  Yes.  Anthony tends to whitewash things just a little bit.  What did I whitewash?  Oh, my God.  She didn't sound like a beauty.  Nothing about that.  No, no, no.  Everything is good as far as your detail goes, except for one thing. 
[00:26:00]  Buzz looked like a Cro-Magnon.  She had a distended brow.  She had a unibrow.  Well, that's a detail that you forgot to tell us, Anthony.  I wasn't looking at her face.  I was horrified at the vag.  What was hairier?  Her vag or her head?  It looked the same.  Her eyebrow.  She had a univage and a unibrow.  Wow.  You were talking about the hair thing.  I mean, that was directly due to the fact that she was like a Neanderthal. 
[00:26:30]  Hey, at least I wasn't 15 banging that 30-year-old mother with a frigging axe crotch.  Wait a second, dude.  She was 32.  Wait.  Are we going to get a new story today?  Oh, there was one time I was with Buzz in one of these bedrooms in this house.  Joe's the older brother.  And Joe was slamming this 32-year-old mom.  While you were banging Buzz?  Yeah, in the same room.  And Joe goes, hey, at midnight, let's switch.  And I said, I go, there is no way I'm banging that old broad. 
[00:27:00]  All right, hold on.  She walked like she'd been riding a horse for about 18 years.  That girl, what was her name?  Do you remember?  Sue.  Sue.  This girl, Sue, a woman, Sue.  Her legs were so spread apart, and she had the gap, like where her vag was supposed to be,  was a gap like a hatchet wound.  Was that from riding horses?  I don't know what it was from.  Or doing horses.  Maybe getting slammed by everything that walked.  But, dude, she had to accommodate me. 
[00:27:30]  So it worked.  All right, wait a minute.  Oh, sure.  Hold on.  Let's slow down, guys.  Slow down.  So, I got to get the visual here.  Yeah.  You're 13, Anthony.  You're banging Buzz.  Yeah.  While Dad's out doing his thing.  Uh-huh.  And Joe's in the bed.  I think I was probably 14 at this time.  All right.  And Joe's in the bed next to you, banging a 32-year-old?  No, a different room.  Oh, no, no.  He was in a different room.  It was a hallway and then two rooms at the end of each hallway.  Did you hear each other going at it?  I don't think so.  There was Peter Frampton was playing.  They always used to put the Frampton Comes Alive album on. 
[00:28:00]  Come on.  I swear.  Sue would always put the Frampton Comes Alive album on, blasting.  And all we heard was, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Don't you feel like me, too?  That wasn't Frampton.  That was actually you going down on Buzz.  You know what?  The old man hooked me up with her as well.  I mean, the old man did a lot of buzz that way.  Oh, there it is.  There's some Frampton.  Is this bringing back memories?  Oh, it's bringing back memories.  Such memories.  Jesus.  Yeah, I think the old man was banging Sue also. 
[00:28:30]  Probably.  Yeah.  So, Joe was a little older.  So, you were only 15 or 16 banging the 32-year-old?  Yeah, I was about 16, I guess.  Yeah, and he was banging the 32-year-old and wanted to switch at midnight.  What, you guys had a little conference in the hallway?  Yeah, yeah.  In between bangings?  We saw Sue breaking out the Frampton album.  We knew we were getting laid.  Real tag team.  Yeah, so Joe wanted to do the switch, and man, I had, believe it or not, Buzz with the 
[00:29:00]  unibrow, the big 70s Earth Mama Muff, the big Amazon woman was bad enough.  But this is telling how bad Sue was.  I wanted no part of her.  There was nothing about Sue that was turning me on.  She was much too old.  She was thin.  She was thin.  She was small.  She was emaciated.  She had flapjack tits.  She had two kids who were in the other room.  She had two kids in the other room.  Wait, wait, wait. 
[00:29:30]  In the other room?  Yeah, there was another room that the kids were in.  This was a flop house.  Oh, that was ridiculous.  I swear to God, man, I would have gone through five Sue's before I would have taken one Buzz.  You wanted Buzz.  You were the one that recommended the switch, that suggested the switch at midnight.  Dude, that was because I was 15 and I figured, what the fuck, we were just scrolling around.  It would be fun, something to do.  Switch it up a little bit.  Horrifying.  What were the kids doing while you were banging their mother?  They were probably playing with Legos.  Who the hell knows?  Who the hell knows?  Did they call you Daddy Joe? 
[00:30:00]  I was a girl.  The girl walking in one time on me.  Oh, great.  The little girl walking in on us one time.  She was like seven.  I know, and she was only about maybe six years younger than me, right?  Did we find any of these people?  Who knows?  I don't know what the hell's going on in California.  Sue's probably, uh, which hippie call me, uh, should we check?  You guys are a bunch of hippies out there.  Yeah, hippies.  Tom Jones last night, who knows?  Probably.  She's old.  Old broad.  Joe, you had a great father, man. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, I'm telling you.  He liked to party, that's for sure.  He gave you guys puha, man.  I remember, yeah.  Dunn's alcohol and the bitches, he hooked us up.  No, my dad gave me, my dad gave me a good jump shot.  There you go.  That's what I got from my dad, a good jump shot.  I used to come, and really good ball handling skills, and you guys are getting puha, man.  Uh, I used to come home from school.  I went to, uh, Marco Forster Junior High School, and it was right by the stable where we kept 
[00:31:00]  the horses.  So, I would get done with school about three o'clock, walk back to the stable, and every  day, my father, who for some reason, uh, couldn't hold a job, was sitting in a chair  with, uh, Chato, the Mexican guy that had a horse at the same ranch.  And, uh, they would just sit there drinking what they called Yombos.  They were the big 40-ounce beers.  Why don't we get another Yombo, Yoey?  And then they'd sit there just drinking beer.  And when their wives or girlfriends would bitch at them, they would look at each other 
[00:31:30]  and go, ah, I'm gonna get me another one.  And this was their life.  Riding horses, drinking, and screwing girls like Buzz and, uh, Sue.  Yeah.  So, he was getting us right in line to do that.  Drinking beer, riding horses, and screwing women.  Making homebrew.  And making the homebrew.  They used to get these casks from these whiskey factories.  Big, uh, wooden barrels.  And they would, uh, take them back to the ranch, fill them up with, uh, like five gallons 
[00:32:00]  of water, and then roll it.  Every couple of days, you'd roll it, like a quarter roll.  And then after a month, you'd drain it out, and you'd get one gallon of liquid that would  come out.  But it was, it was like pure alcohol that would leech out of the wood from the casks.  And we're kids, and they're giving us shots of this stuff.  We were fucked up, I mean, completely hammered.  What a great way to be raised.  Dude, you drank a glass, you had it on the rocks, and stood up from a... 
[00:32:30]  That's how I drank at 13.  On the rocks.  On the rocks.  Go ahead, Joe.  Joey.  Yo.  Yeah, go ahead.  Go ahead.  No, and then you proceeded to go straight down to your knees.  Oh, yeah.  Took a big shot and just went thud.  Passed out.  It was great.  Why straight down to your knees?  Buzz was, uh, standing in front of Anthony there?  No, I wouldn't have gotten on my knees from Buzz, that's for sure.  Looked like tumbleweed rolled in her lap.  All right, you know what?  To wrap this up, you guys got to tell the story of mom finally calling out to California and 
[00:33:00]  going, boys, it's time to come home.  I think she was a little concerned for your safety.  Oh, that was when we, yeah, we had decided it was time to come back east and maybe get  civilized for a little while.  I was just coming back to visit.  Joe, of course, was coming back to live there.  But after I visited with my family here in New York for a while, I realized I was kind  of programmed in California and they kind of deprogrammed me here in New York and I  decided I better stay because I really was heading on the road to ruin out there. 
[00:33:30]  But it's funny how you guys got back home.  You had to take a bus trip, right?  Well, my mother had sent out two airline tickets for me and my brother to fly us from California  to New York.  So my father got the tickets, went to the airline, sold the tickets, took the money and bought  us two Greyhound bus tickets and put us on the bus.  And there we were on this two-week-long excursion.  But you can't be pissed at him because he gave you puha, man.  There you go.  I know. 
[00:34:00]  With hookers and pimps.  Yeah, so we were taking a bus all the way from California, L.A., to New York City.  And it stopped at every city.  You know, we stopped everywhere.  And the collection of dregs of society, male hookers, hustlers, girl hookers, pimps, and  I'm talking like huggy bear pimps.  These guys with the fur hats and everything.  It was just a collection.  An ouzo bum who had a bottle of ouzo with him the whole trip that everybody, when he passed 
[00:34:30]  out, would take and pass around the bottle.  And we were drinking this bum's ouzo.  This hot chick we met that was getting off in Cheyenne, but decided to hang out with  us all the way into New York.  Who knows what happened to her?  Probably murdered or ended up a hooker.  And then we finally get to New York after two weeks on the road.  And right when we step off the bus, we get arrested by NYPD.  NYPD.  This detective comes over.  And he came up to me and grabbed me by the shoulder and said, excuse me, boys, you have  to come with me. 
[00:35:00]  Right?  Mm-hmm.  And now you left out the fact that I was smuggling in tie sticks.  Right.  Now the cop goes, come with me, get your bags.  And we're like, oh my God.  Joe's got like pounds of tie sticks.  How old were you, Joe?  Oh, God.  I was 17 now.  I think you were 17.  Okay.  I was about 17, 16, 17.  Just like a load of tie stick in his bag.  And the guy goes, we're going to get your bags and we're going to check you out. 
[00:35:30]  You know, because they thought we were runaways.  They thought we were runaways coming into New York to, you know, hustle or something.  So thank God that girl did follow us from Cheyenne and just hang out with us on the bus.  We told her, could you get this one bag and get it immediately before we get there?  And she ran and got the bag and actually didn't steal it.  And took it.  And then the cop goes to call my mom up.  And I'm like, could you just identify yourself and first say your kids are fine.  I'm NYPD.  And I've just took them.  And I want to verify that they're not runaways. 
[00:36:00]  He gets on the phone.  Hello, Rosemary.  Yes.  Do you have two sons, Joseph and Anthony?  Yeah.  And you just, my mother's horrified.  This guy just strung it along without like telling her we were okay.  Guy was a real prick.  But we got off the hook.  Remember the knives that the old man gave us?  Yeah.  He like confiscated our knives.  By his side.  And the cop was patting me down.  You know, he goes, oh, what's this?  What's this?  Put his hand over by his gun. 
[00:36:30]  Takes the knife away from me.  Yeah.  What a collar.  Yeah.  What a collar.  Getting the Kumia boys.  Goddamn hysterical.  Well, thank you for the memories, Joe.  I forgot about Sue.  All right.  More stories than that, though.  For another day, all that Mojave Desert.  Oh, I know.  Oh, shootings and everything.  Yeah, we'll talk about the shooting next time you call in, right?  I saw more shootings than Puffy.  Yeah.  On an entire show, too.  Yeah.  Oh, that's a great story.  But you're going to have to tell it live in the studio, though.  Yeah.  But, Joe, bashing Buzz when you're banging a Sue is a little much. 
[00:37:00]  Come on.  She was this mousy woman with these big glasses.  Remember Sue's big dopey.  She looked like Tweety Bird.  She had these big glasses.  Hi, Joe.  I got my glasses, and I'm going to bang you to Peter Frampton.  Ow, my ass hurts from last night.  Oh, that's funny.  Don't bang my Cro-Magnon, woman.  I don't know, man.  Who'd you rather fuck, Tweety Bird or Mike Tyson? 
[00:37:30]  I was screwing Sasquatch.  No shit.  That's great.  All right, Brother Joe.  In the groove.  Opie and Anthony.  Do some push-ups, fatty.  This is the best show ever.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Here's Opie and Anthony when they aren't stinking.  Oh, who took their shoes off?  It's a little stinky in here.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Ah, Tony on Long Island.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Just to say, talk about taking one for the team.  I used to work for a company and I dealt with a girl in Chicago who she moved down to Atlanta. 
[00:38:00]  And so we got talking and I'd just broken up with my girlfriend.  And so one night we started having phone sex after she gave me her home number.  So I said, you know what?  This is crazy.  Let's meet halfway between Atlanta and Richmond and find out and let's have sex for real.  So I get in the car.  It's Belmont weekend.  I'm stuck in traffic.  Bleary-eyed.  Nine hours later, I get down to Richmond, Virginia. 
[00:38:30]  And I get out of the car and she's like 350 pounds.  And I'm like, holy shit.  You didn't like ask those questions before you decided to commit to a long drive?  I was like, whatever.  You know, I'd just broken up with a girlfriend of four years.  I wanted to get one right out of the way just to have it happen.  And I got down there and it was just like she was huge.  But I was like, I can't turn around without getting some.  So I took one for the team. 
[00:39:00]  I don't get that, man.  Oh, dude, that's awful.  I won't talk to a fat chick if she lives five minutes from me, much less drive nine hours and acknowledge one.  What's wrong with you?  All right, well, here's the real shame.  She was a real nymphomaniac and I wanted to get anal sex.  So I flew down to Atlanta and banged her in the ass all weekend.  It was horrible.  We're out in Buckhead and there's like all these hot chicks.  And there I am with this big pig like in the car in Buckhead. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, wow.  It was horrible.  Did she want to go out?  Yeah, she's like, oh, let's go out.  So now you've got to walk around with her?  Yeah, it was horrible.  She wanted to come to New York and I was like, absolutely not.  Cut it off right there.  It's all about the anal sex.  I've walked around Buckhead.  You're right.  There's a lot of beautiful women in that area.  She wants to show you with a 350-pound girl because she needs to go out.  You got on a plane to have sex with a barnyard animal.  Congratulations. 
[00:40:00]  That's hilarious.  Me too, guys.  All right.  I like when the honesty comes out on this show, man.  That's, you know, something that reminds me a lot of the Dreamweaver story from years ago.  I remember that.  It was just I didn't want to be seen with her.  And, you know, it's self-centered.  It's nasty.  It's probably not the nicest thing to do.  But it was a girl that I met on the CB radio named Dreamweaver, of course.  That's the music.  Her name was Dreamweaver.  That was her CB handle. 
[00:40:30]  The Dreamweaver.  And what were you again?  I was Wrangler.  That's right, Wrangler.  I was the Wrangler because my job back then was on horseback.  I would keep, like, stable animals together and in their pens.  And I was a Wrangler.  You know, if any of the steer got out, I would wrangle them back in.  The Wrangler.  I hope that's why you got that name.  Yeah, there's so many.  So that is why.  So did you use the CB radio to try to pick up chicks back then? 
[00:41:00]  No, no.  Was it for the job?  I didn't use it to pick up chicks.  Everyone had a CB back then.  It was all the rage.  It was the mid to late 70s.  So everyone had CB.  No one had cell phones, Opie.  So it was, you know.  Breaker, Breaker.  Breaker for the Dreamweaver.  You got your ears on?  It's the Wrangler.  I'll be 10-10, 10-8 on the side.  Dreamweaver.  If you're out there. 
[00:41:30]  Okay, Dreamweaver.  If you're out there, the Wrangler's on the side.  Out.  But how did you start talking to her?  She just happened to be on the CB one day?  Yeah, I think I was trying to get in touch with somebody else.  Mm-hmm.  You know?  Maybe my brother Joe.  Hey, Flying Fingers.  You out there, Flying Fingers?  His name was Flying Fingers?  Yeah.  Why?  Uh, guitar player.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I know.  Ugh.  Hey, Flying Fingers, you out there? 
[00:42:00]  And then, uh, one day I hear a voice over the radio.  And it was, uh, it was Dreamweaver.  It's Dreamweaver.  And she, um, she almost had, like, an attitude, like, why am I talking on the bullhorn now?  Like, um, Daria on MTV.  You know Daria?  She kind of had that whole thing, so it was kind of a cool attitude back then. 
[00:42:30]  So I started talking to her.  You know?  Hey, Dreamweaver, this is the Wrangler.  Well, where are you from?  Oh, I'm from, uh, Dana Point.  Oh, I'm San Juan Capistrano.  I'm, I'm right, you know, down the road.  Oh.  Well, I gotta go.  Okay.  How old were you?  And then maybe, oh, God.  Thirteen, fourteen?  Yeah, thirteen.  Uh, and, and, you know, we kind of, you know, every night when I'd get on the CB radio. 
[00:43:00]  She was there?  She was there.  You know, she was always on the CB.  And, uh, we, we would talk.  That should have been your first clue.  Should have been.  The first clue.  Always on the CB radio.  And, uh, I decided one day that I was gonna ask her to, on a, a date.  A date.  But, you know, my term kind of date.  Not your ordinary date.  We're gonna go horse, horseback riding.  Because I have, uh, horses.  And that's what I do.  That's what I do now.  So, uh, you gotta, uh, uh, Dreamweaver to Wrangler. 
[00:43:30]  I'd like to know what you're doing this Saturday.  Oh, nothing.  Oh, okay, uh, you wanna go horseback riding with me?  And you never met her?  Never met her.  That's, uh, that's the key to the story.  Okay.  Never met her.  Okay.  Alright, um, you know where, uh, the river, uh, bed, uh, splits in Capistrano?  Yeah, I know that.  Okay, I'll meet you there.  And, uh, we'll go riding this weekend.  We've got a bunch of hills we could go riding up in.  Oh, that sounds great.  Okay, Dreamweaver out.  Okay, Wrangler, over and out.  I'll see you Saturday.  Well, you're, were you all excited at this point? 
[00:44:00]  Oh, oh, it's great.  Because you have this image in your head, what she looks like, probably.  Dreamweaver.  Oh, the name.  It should say it all.  She's weaving dreams in my head of what she could be.  Dreamweaver.  Dreamweaver has to, has to be a hot chick, right?  Absolutely.  Dreamweaver.  So, all day Saturday, all morning, I got up early.  I washed two horses, which, you know, it's quite a chore, and, uh, brushed the horses down. 
[00:44:30]  They looked great.  Uh, take some saddle soap to the, uh, saddle and everything.  Did you clean out their sheath?  No, I didn't clean out the sheath.  Pulling out chunks of beef jerky out of there.  I never understood the people that did clean out the sheath.  There was some stable...  What the hell is cleaning out the sheath?  Dude, there was some stable whores, uh, that used to keep horses around where we kept them.  And they were girls, you know, in their teens.  They had these horses that used to clean their horses. 
[00:45:00]  You know, you gotta clean the hooves.  You take this hook in your hand, lift the hoof up, and you're, like, scraping horse shit out of their hooves.  Right.  Clean it out.  And then, uh, you brush them, you bathe them.  You gotta clean their teeth sometimes, you know, and their ears.  Uh, and then their sheath.  This is a male horse.  You know, they don't walk around with their dick hanging out all, all the time.  It goes up into a sheath that's on their underbelly.  This sheath gets filthy.  And dried up skin and dirt and rocks get caught up in there. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, all kinds of crap gets caught in there.  And these girls would reach up, grab this giant horse cock, and just pull it out of the sheath and start picking off all this dirt.  As they're just, you know, talking, hey, what's up, how you doing?  Does the horse get excited?  Uh, sometimes, yeah.  But most of the part, they're just looking around, you know, eating their hay, and, uh, getting stuff picked off of them.  Just disgusting.  No, I didn't clean the sheath. 
[00:46:00]  Just smelt it under your fingernails.  It did.  Some of these pieces were, like, beef jerky.  Dude, when I was at college, are you done with the sheath part?  Because it reminded me of something.  When I was at college, I had this roommate, um, and his job on the weekends was to mate horses.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And he had to go to work with a raincoat on.  And his whole job, I swear to God.  Because I, I don't know, but I hear, like, when they, when they, you know what, it's, it's unbelievable.  Well, it's, uh. 
[00:46:30]  It's everywhere, and there's a lot of it.  It's just calamity.  Is it really?  Yeah, yeah.  We, we used to.  Have you seen horses?  Yeah.  Have you seen a horse just ejaculate?  We didn't do it like they do it now.  It's very technical and stuff.  Right.  In a, in a lab, you know, we just threw a horse that was in heat together with a, a stallion, and they would go at it.  And a lot of times, uh, the, the horse would miss, but horses just, they're completely premature.  The horse would hop up on the other one.  The stallion would hop up on the mare, and if the horse's cock just, like, hit the thigh of the other horse, 
[00:47:00]  and it would just go spraying everywhere.  There's a lot of it, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, because this kid would, he had his special raincoat, and his whole job was to make sure he got that, you know, penis in her.  Right, and he'd try to put it in.  And he, he would, he would get covered with freaking horse.  They'd get all worked up, and unless it's in, you know, if it's not in, it's going to go everywhere.  What a job.  So they would go crazy.  You know, because, you know, in college, man, you're all hungover and tired, and this was his job, you know, after maybe two hours sleep, 
[00:47:30]  he would get his raincoat and go down to the horse farm to mate horses.  Yeah, that's right, old boy.  So, you're going to get a piece of her, aren't you?  Oh, calm down.  Oh, hey, hey.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I'm not going to race him, though.  I'm just going to jerk him off.  Very good.  Just going to clean his sheath.  So, all right, Dreamweaver, the horses are ready for your little date, right? 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  All right, getting all excited for my date, cleaned the horse up.  And now I was riding up into the hills that we used to ride up in all the time and take care of the cattle and everything.  So, I wanted to look the part.  So, I had my western attire on, Opie.  And I was the little cowboy.  Oh, my God.  I had the hat.  I had the boots, spurs, chaps, jeans, and a western style shirt. 
[00:48:30]  That's how I used to dress.  Did you have a gay video crew following you?  I know.  You know, in any other circumstance, that is very gay.  But I was actually doing the work.  I was a working cowboy out there, out west.  And I want to look the part.  I had my rifle.  I had saddlebags with our lunch in it and stuff.  And I even had a bedroll just in case.  Just in case old Dreamweaver decided to be a goer. 
[00:49:00]  I had everything I needed.  And what I planned on doing, I had all these fantasies going on in my head.  She was weaving dreams on me.  I was going to go out there.  I was going to shoot a rabbit and then skin it and cook it right there like I knew how to do,  like I'd done plenty of times when we used to go out camping and stuff.  And I was going to cook her a rabbit.  And you were going to live off the land with Dreamweaver.  Live off the land, just me and Dreamweaver up in the hill. 
[00:49:30]  And I was thinking this, and this was what I was going to do.  With a skinny 13-year-old kid.  Oh, pull out my six-gun.  Yeah.  Look at me.  I just bagged us a rabbit, Dreamweaver.  And you're so hot.  Oh, yeah.  I was completely like, I had been thinking about this all day.  How long had you been talking to her?  Probably about two weeks, I guess.  About two weeks just talking.  So we kind of got to know each other and everything.  And she was into horses, and I thought this was going to be a great first date. 
[00:50:00]  I was going to show what a man I was.  I even got some homebrew.  It was this stuff that the Mexicans used to make at a stable that was real close to ours.  They used to take these bourbon barrels that they would get from the distillery,  fill it up with three gallons of water, and then roll it around every day for about a month.  And when you poured it out, you got a gallon would come out of just the strongest fuck-you-up liquid I've ever had in my life. 
[00:50:30]  Moonshine.  Besides some of that, maybe get Dreamweaver a little, you know, get a little tipsy and stuff.  Drink it out of those tin cups like the old West guys used to do.  Want to snort?  You know, keep it with the old West motif.  Well, get the horses, go to where the river splits there in San Juan Capistrano, and I'm waiting for her.  Got there early, you know.  You got butterflies in your stomach, right?  I did.  I'm still looking at everything, making sure everything's okay. 
[00:51:00]  And off in the distance, I see a figure walking down the riverbed, and that must have been Dreamweaver.  Here she comes, but it's just a speck coming, and I can't quite figure it out yet.  Maybe the sun's in your eye a little bit, but you see the silhouette, right?  I'm looking.  She came in out of the rising sun.  Yeah, I was looking.  As she's getting closer, I'm thinking, well, maybe the heat is, you know, spreading things out. 
[00:51:30]  You know how the heat waves on the highway make the highway look a little wider?  A little higher, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It could get like that.  Was it cold?  Maybe she had a Parker on.  Maybe she had something, even though it was a very hot day.  Right.  Oh, God.  No.  No.  And as she got closer, I can't explain my disappointment.  I think I can explain it with this.  Wah, wah, wah, wah. 
[00:52:00]  Dude, the disappointment is really coming back to me now.  I'm kind of remembering how disappointing it was.  I had this image of this beautiful girl that was going to come and ride with me, and I  swear, I was going to take the ride first through town and then up into the hills, just  so people could see me with the girl I imagined I was going to be with.  And then your date was going to end with puppet sex.  It was just going to be crazy.  You were going to be having sex on the riverbed. 
[00:52:30]  I was just having sex like the Marlboro Man.  I was just going to be there with this hot girl in a bedroll with a campfire with my  rabbit and the river and guns and whiskey and broads and horses and fucking a manly  night with my hot, broad Dreamweaver.  The disappointment set in at 100 yards.  I saw her big, fat head and her big, fat face and her greasy, stringy hair and her loose-fitting, 
[00:53:00]  bunt-ridden jeans.  Bunt-ridden jeans.  The bunt wore away the jeans like your knees were.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  A little frayed at the bunt.  Yeah.  I can't tell you, because I had built it up to something so huge in my head, the disappointment 
[00:53:30]  was such a letdown.  Did you fake it, though, like a big smile, like, hey, glad to meet you.  I don't even think I did.  I don't even think I did.  And perhaps she was just as disappointed, thinking I was this Marlboro man.  I was, you know, Mr. Macho.  And there I am with my, you know, little skinny arms and, you know, trying to pull off the cowboy  thing.  But, you know, she was fat.  She was very disappointed. 
[00:54:00]  So what did you do?  Well, I tried to say, hey, how you doing, with a big smile and stuff, but it was just  like, hey, what's up?  I think the person that was more pissed was the horse that she got to ride.  Looked at me like, thanks.  Thanks a lot.  What was it, Clydesdale busy?  I said, you know, how you doing? 
[00:54:30]  She hops on the horse.  No ride through town.  No proud ride through town as I show off this girl.  I imagine just hair blowing as people looked up and went, wow, what a beautiful girl on  that horse and turned directly around, went down the river, up into the hills, took a  ride for about, I'll be honest, 45 minutes.  That was it.  No bedroll, no fire, no hunting rabbit, no sex. 
[00:55:00]  I'd had a bag of moose to feed that bitch, believe me, with no rabbit.  She'd have ate the rabbit whole, fur and all.  One bite.  Darn her.  Gone.  Yeah.  And none of that.  None of that fun stuff, I imagine.  45 minutes, I just went like, ah, we better get heading in.  And I think she even asked why, and I said something, the horse, oh, I think the one you're  on was coming up lame or something, and, you know, I had to get it back early. 
[00:55:30]  But I had a great time, thanks.  Dropped it back off where the river splits and took the horse back.  It was disappointing.  I remember my father was all happy and stuff.  And he said, hey, how'd it go, you know?  It's like, oh, Dad, she was a fat broad.  And she said something that Jimmy said the other day, you know, sometimes you just got  to go hogging.  That's what Dad said?  Yeah.  You know, he always had kind words of wisdom like that.  You truly had the greatest dad.  Yeah.  You really had the greatest dad. 
[00:56:00]  And that was, you know.  You ever saw her again, did you?  Nope.  I think I saw her once more.  I never, never called, like, I'd be on the CB, you know.  Hey, it's the Wrangler looking for flying fingers.  Wrangler looking for flying fingers.  You out there flying fingers?  Hey, Wrangler, it's Dreamweaver.  Wrangler out.  You just blew it off totally?  Dreamweaver, Wrangler, you got your ears on?  Yeah, unfortunately for you, I had my eyes on that day.  And I saw what a fat pig you were. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  Hey, Dreamweaver, got your pork chops on?  Wow.  Yeah, so I saw her one day, one night at a party at another stable.  And she was singing around a campfire with a bunch of other people.  And we kind of just traded a passing glance.  But I think, you know, she knew that I was disappointed.  I couldn't even hide it because of what I built up.  No one would have lived up to that.  And who was that girl that was in Playboy years ago? 
[00:57:00]  Heft's like first real celebrity chick.  Barbie Benton.  Remember Barbie Benton?  I know her name.  Where was she from?  She was just, I don't know, kind of hot.  And she was in Playboy.  Brunette, centerfold.  Yeah.  She was in Playboy.  That was my image.  It was Barbie Benton was going to show up.  And if we'll find a picture, I'm sure we will.  During commercials or something, pop one up or someone send a link.  And said, Kirstie Alley showed up.  Yes.  Yes.  That was it.  I expected Barbie Benton. 
[00:57:30]  I got Kirstie Alley.  Breaker, breaker to the Wrangler.  I know.  It's the Dreamweaver, and I got my ears on.  Breaker, breaker.  I look a lot like Barbie Benton on the radio.  Where's Dreamweaver, boy?  You're a hunting rabbit.  I want a Diablo sandwich and a Dr. Pepper and make it snappy.  I'm in a goddamn hurry.  And then there she came out.  Yoo-hoo, Wrangler. 
[00:58:00]  Thank you, nice lady.  Nice ass.  I'm just still disappointed now that I think that it really hurt me back then.  Evil and loving it.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I almost broke my vagina.  Drink until she's pretty.  It's a freak show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show, and I hope you're enjoying it, and I hope  you're laughing, because that's our goal.  If we can just put a smile on the face of one retarded child. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, our first negative call.  What?  That's our first negative call, and we were just starting to feel really good about ourselves.  Oh, gee.  Hi, Kenny.  Hey, what's going on, man?  What's up, Kenny?  Hey, are you going to get some kind of agenda here, or make this kind of funny?  An agenda?  Yeah.  You know, kind of get some kind of skit going, or...  Oh, we don't do skit going.  Kenny, we don't do that.  Like, what kind of skit?  What kind of skit are you looking for, sir? 
[00:59:00]  Well, you know, something that's funny.  Where are you calling from?  Oh, California.  San Jose.  No, I'm...  What show do you listen to where you like the skits?  Oh, well, no.  I'm a big fan of XM.  Okay.  I love Station 150.  I love the comedy.  The comedy channel is nice.  What's a show you listen to that has skits?  So we'll try to go get that type of a skit for the show to keep you happy.  Well, how about something that actually works out? 
[00:59:30]  Not some chick with a wiffle ball bat that's on her period.  Oh, well...  What's funnier than that?  Well, that was a big disappointment.  You're right.  Yes, we're very disappointed.  I agree with Kenny on that.  And I'm sure our listeners are, too.  But know what's great about this show?  Another girl will step up sometime this week, and she'll take Jackie's place, and we'll get  the wiffle ball bat thing done.  Ken, you're a preacher to the choir.  What kind of a skit do you want to hear?  Don't say something funny.  Just give us something specific that we can work on.  We're listening to the new listeners.  Let's do something funny, something not...  It doesn't have to be comical.  I want to...  It doesn't have to be comical? 
[01:00:00]  I want to do a whole...  We need some...  We need some comedy here.  Like, what...  Tell me what you...  Kenny, boy, what do you need?  I want to do the buh-byes skit.  I don't know.  Aren't you guys...  Why don't we all just...  What?  Aren't you supposed to be funny?  No, no.  But, Kenny, what I'm saying is this.  You sound like a rube who enjoys that mom-and-pop type of phony, horse-shit, dog-shit  radio they have in California, so I'm saying...  I'm sure that's the kind of humor you like, the easy, down-the-middle stuff.  You know, a little wacky character.  Ding-dong!  Funny male guy. 
[01:00:30]  We're asking you what you like.  Excuse me.  Excuse me there, asshole.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  They don't say that, you skit!  Wow!  What is this?  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  If you're criticizing the radio I listen to...  Well, hold on.  Hold on.  What's that?  Yes?  If you're criticizing the radio I listen to, it's your fucking employer...  Ooh, dirty language for such a skit-loving little boy.  What I'm saying is, person who I hope dies of cancer the day before a relative gets married,  what type of a skit would you like to hear? 
[01:01:00]  And you're not being specific.  You're being passive-aggressive like every other faggot from that state that you live in.  So will you please be specific?  Get the cock out of your mouth and talk right.  Be specific.  Get the cock out of your mouth and talk right.  Oh, he got you there.  Oh, I got a cock in my mouth.  Well, it's your father.  Since your mother won't suck it, I decided to lean over and toot on it a little bit.  What's up with the risk, huh?  What's that?  I'm here in San Francisco sucking cock, you fag.  Ooh, there we go.  That's the type of skit you like, isn't it?  Dirty two men talking about sucking cocks. 
[01:01:30]  Now we got what you like.  Two men going back and forth.  So tell us what you want, Kenny.  You know what?  There's good radio right there, man.  There's good radio.  Yes.  Because you're involved.  What do you want?  You want these faggity sketches.  We don't do sketches, stupid.  Except for our buh-bye skit.  We don't do skits.  No?  Why do we just have these truck drivers calling in?  You know, which I agree.  They're fine. 
[01:02:00]  They're great callers.  But we all ain't offering them a fail.  Oh, I know you want to sketch with a funny southern voice.  That's probably the type of comedy you like.  The type of thing where the funny voice is happening.  Or maybe the gay character comes in.  Hi, boys.  And you're like, oh, that's good.  The guy sounds gay.  I'm having a real hard time understanding you.  No, you're not, stupid.  Bad speech impairment, don't you?  Impairment?  What's an impairment, you fucking idiot?  I speak perfectly clearly.  And you understand everything I'm saying.  You sound like fucking a cross between Sylvester the Cat and Elmer. 
[01:02:30]  Wow, that was really an obscure reference.  I see.  You like cartoon references.  You got a horn just like...  Wait, hold on, hold on.  Let Kenny finish his obscure reference.  What was that?  Things quick on his feet?  You got to get a little bit more original than that, right?  Oh, you don't understand the irony of it, you West Coast idiot?  There's nothing coming out of that fucking state but soft, weak garbage.  And that's what you like.  Commercial garbage.  I've asked you for a show that you listen to. 
[01:03:00]  Let me finish, fucker.  I've asked you for something that you like, and you haven't been able to provide it.  Name me one show you listen to.  Name me one show.  That's what I'm listening to.  I've been an XM subscriber for over a year.  I don't give a shit.  Cancel the service, faggot.  Tell me something you listen to.  Don't you're not going to blackmail me?  I'm an XM subscriber.  I don't get a piece of the action, motherfucker.  What do I care?  Oh, shit.  Don't lose a customer.  I don't care if you throw your XM down the toilet, buy a serious, and then fuck your mother. 
[01:03:30]  I have an XM subscriber, mister.  He's threatening you.  I pay my $9.95 a month.  $1.99.  I pay my taxes.  You're a civil servant.  I pay your salary.  Oh, my God.  You're trying to blackmail me with that horse shit?  Are you out of your mind, stupid?  Watch you listen for a second.  Watch you listen for a second.  If you answer my question, I will listen.  Yes, I am gay.  I want to tell you something.  All right.  The smartest thing to come out of his mouth was his boyfriend's cock.  Oh, wow. 
[01:04:00]  You paused us for that.  Now he got you.  He got you.  Did you actually just make us stop talking for that horse shit, cornball, he-ho-  Your head should pop out of a laughing box when you say that.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Nobody can fucking understand you.  Oh, you understand me pretty well.  Oh.  Tell me what you want to hear.  Tell me what you want to hear.  You're not answering the question.  How about something funny?  What show do you think is funny?  You got something funny.  What show?  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  No, I'm not going to wait a minute, you cocksucker. 
[01:04:30]  What's to tell me to wait a minute, you faggoty West Coast caller?  You know how old you fucking get paid to do?  Yes, I get paid a lot to do this.  That's the beauty of it.  I don't know.  And you're fucking ripping them off all the way to the bank.  Oh, I'm ripping, I'm laughing all the way to the bank, am I, you cliche slinging bucket of jism?  I hope you're killing a drunk driving accident on New Year's Eve.  We want to hear some sketches with Southern voices.  Get behind the wheel after drinking a few and plow into a pregnant lady.  How's that for a sketch?  West Coast jerk off. 
[01:05:00]  I want to hear a sketch.  I'm an XM subscriber.  Who gives a shit?  Hey, if you cancel the service, ship me your fucking roadie, too, because I can't get one from the company.  Do you believe?  I don't even mind him hating the show.  That's fine.  But the balls on this idiot to think that I get a piece of the action, and that I'm somehow concerned he may cancel.  Uh-oh.  Walk on eggshells with this fella. 
[01:05:30]  He's a subscriber for over a year.  That means you've pumped in about $130 plus a unit.  You get no say.  None.  Your opinion is worthless on this network.  And he will pay $1.99 for November, I guarantee it.  Good.  I don't care if he doesn't.  He's not going anywhere.  He's not going anywhere.  Believe me, he's not going anywhere.  He's going to tell all his friends how he was the star of the show today.  Yeah, I paused it.  Here's the part where I paused it.  Funniest thing to ever come out of your mouth was your boyfriend's cock. 
[01:06:00]  Wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah.  I hope you're on a casino bus that flips over.  That usually happens in Jersey, by the way.  Yeah, it really does.  My casino bus flipped over in Jersey.  Had he named one show, this is my problem.  If he would have named a show, like he thinks this show sucks, all right, fine.  But just name a show that you like.  And he kept going, I listen to XM.  Like, I'm going to go, uh-oh, don't talk about XM because he listens to it.  Tell me a show you like. 
[01:06:30]  That was a guy that just really had a complete lack of understanding of what this show and everyone involved in this show is all about.  Look where he lives, man.  The West Coast, that's what they go for.  They want soft little sketches, mom and parents.  You're obsessed with the West Coast.  I don't think it's a West Coast thing.  I know you don't.  But everything that's ever stopped in my career has been because the West Coast people didn't like it.  Everything that the East Coast likes, we just got to run up by the West Coast.  Well, that fucking idea.  Yeah, I guess we should tell everyone, if you're looking for structure from the Opie and Anthony show, you're never going to get it. 
[01:07:00]  No, that's what he wants.  We make up this crap on the fly every single day.  That's what annoyed me about, not this guy thinking your humor sucks.  That's fine.  But when it's, I know what I want.  I like A, B, and C.  I like sitcom type of humor.  That's what makes me sick.  Opie and Anthony, XM202.  Speaking of 9-11, holy ass, what's going on with these commemorative coins?  Remember 9-11?  That was hilarious.  You know, right when I saw the commercials, I don't think there's an American alive that was watching TV, sees the commercial for these commemorative coins. 
[01:07:30]  Remember 9-11?  I don't think there's an American alive that watched that and went, oh, yeah, that's a great product.  Boy, thank God someone's exploiting this and putting out a piece of shit coin that's silver plated.  And if you took the silver content off of that, you couldn't fill a mouse tooth with it.  And they're making it sound like it's real silver.  And emblazoned on the front are the towers that we lost on September 11th. 
[01:08:00]  On the backside is the new Freedom Tower rising like a phoenix in its place.  And the money coming out of your pocket and going into our accounts as we exploit this.  That company, I actually called them when I saw a commercial.  I've never done that before and left a vile, awful message on the machine.  I'm sure they're just laughing at it.  Like they care, oh, we better stop selling this.  So this man sounds a little aggravated with us.  Who approved this and who's getting the money? 
[01:08:30]  Whatever the company's name was, they list it.  It's a company, I believe, in Wyoming, and they got these coins printed on some South Pacific island.  But I saw one commercial that they're claiming some of this metal came from the actual site.  Right.  They're saying that the silver was in a vault that was in the tower, and they dug it out, got the silver, melted it down, and made these coins.  It's probably technically true, like when Kiss did the comic book in 77, their blood went into the ink.  They probably, like, you take a little bit, you melt it in. 
[01:09:00]  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, they poured vials of their blood into the ink.  That's true.  Technically, it was in there.  Kiss is so cool.  This is also the same company, by the way, that came out with the Andrea Yates commemorative bathtub rubber duckies.  Jesus.  Dude, the New York Times reporter's right next to you.  I'm sorry.  We're trying to look clever here.  This is our clever book.  That was a great reference.  No one talks about Andrea Yates.  It was brilliant.  Trust me, it was brilliant.  Yeah, Spitzer's on the case, and this guy's usually an ass, but...  Elliot Spitzer, he's looking out for you.  He really is this time around. 
[01:09:30]  Shame, shame, shame on you.  It was a shameless attempt to profit from a national tragedy, obviously.  Yeah.  So, they have these things printed up on some South Pacific island, and the commercial is so misleading.  But if you have half a brain, you can kind of figure it out for yourself.  They were saying, legal tender.  And it says, in God we trust, and one dollar on it.  But it's not a legal dollar.  So, saying legal tender isn't legal.  It's printed on some South Pacific island, so it says, sanctioned by the government. 
[01:10:00]  They don't say what government.  So, they don't say what government.  Making it sound like it's sanctioned by the United States, which it's not.  They say 100 mil of pure silver.  It's like one hundredth of a millimeter of silver plated over brass.  Or bronze.  Not even brass.  So, you're getting nothing for $39. 
[01:10:30]  A one dollar coin for $39.  I'm sure most of the people watching the commercials are assuming this is going for a good cause.  Yeah.  You know?  It's going for their cause.  It's just going for a good cause.  Money in their pocket is going for a good cause.  They don't, right?  I think they, no, it's not even advertised that it's going for a good cause.  But I think the feel of the commercial, it almost feels like they're going to be giving this away.  I get to do my part.  I'm doing a good thing.  It is.  They say something like, do your part as an American and buy these, you know.  It just feels dirty, though.  How dumb are people?  Pretty dumb.  To not know that they're not going to make a coin with towers and a freedom tower. 
[01:11:00]  It's just, how stupid is the public?  People are stupid.  Dude, I got in a huge fight down at Ground Zero.  I actually tipped over one of those car tables because, uh.  Wow, the destruction you wrought down there.  Oh, I heard you kicked the chair once, too.  I tipped the table.  How'd they clean that up down there?  I tipped over a table.  Jesus.  And the police got involved and stuff, but they saw what I was doing and they let me be.  I got so pissed off.  I skated down to Ground Zero.  And I'm checking out the scene, right? 
[01:11:30]  And they were still, um, I don't know if they're still doing it.  I haven't been down there in a while.  But they were still, uh, selling the pictures of the towers on fire.  Oh, there were some ragheads and stuff selling these.  I mean, if you're, what a suicidal piece of shit.  These guys were selling pictures of the towers on fire.  Completely on fire.  Big 8x10 photos here in the city.  On fire.  You know, oh, would you like to buy?  What?  How are you alive?  And, uh.  Look at this guy, like, how is he still alive?  And I had a moment, I got in a fight with the guy, and he didn't even speak English, 
[01:12:00]  but he's kind of getting in my face, like, you know.  Go figure that out in New York City.  It's like, he's pretty much like, tough shit, what are you going to do about it?  That's the feeling I got by how he was, like, reacted to it.  It was those cheap little card tables.  He had all his displays.  I just went for it.  Knocked the whole thing.  Tipped it over?  Wow.  Not just tipped it over.  I just completely just destroyed the display.  I'm just picturing you all pissed off.  Getting into a fight.  Clam with it, and then you skate away.  Slow motion like a video.  Tipped him the table over.  I didn't skate away. 
[01:12:30]  How do you leave angrily on skates?  You're right.  How do you leave?  Yeah.  I showed him.  I showed him.  Like hopping on a pogo stick and pogoing away.  Yeah, asshole.  Who did this to you?  That guy pirouetting over there.  Don't make me come back here.  Boing, boing, boing, boing.  Gling, gling with the bell.  Gling, gling, gling, gling.  Yeah.  I'm coming back for you. 
[01:13:00]  Out of my way.  Wow.  I figured I'd share.  Top guy.  I did my part.  Showed him as he rollerblades away.  You're lucky I'm wearing woman's footwear.  Puts both arms behind his back, leans forward, and skates away.  Speed skating fashion.  I showed him. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, boy.  Boy, did I show him.  We got more info on the coins.  Tad from San Francisco.  Hey, Tad.  Hey.  I actually did some research on the internet when I first saw these commercials.  As you can tell, I stay up pretty late listening to the show and stuff like that.  So, I'm always watching TV.  And they started these commercials right about the anniversary of it.  And, yeah, I was like the 12th or something.  I saw it and I just flipped out. 
[01:14:00]  But I did some research on it.  They're minted by the North Marianas Islands, which is actually part of the United States.  It's a commonwealth that we're in charge of.  Yeah, I'm sure we really – I'm sure it's just like, you know, Nebraska.  I'm sure they're one of the countries that sent help in Iraq.  There's four of them.  The Coalition of the Willing?  Yeah.  We – the actual – the U.S. Mint put out a thing that said –  Easter Island sent like five heads to Iraq as a coalition of the willing. 
[01:14:30]  Five of those big Easter Island heads.  So, they're part of the coalition, which is nice.  Yes.  Sorry, sir.  Yes, go ahead.  Canary Island sent three canaries.  They just talk all day.  Go ahead.  Come on, Tad.  Let's go.  Yes, sir.  Sorry I keep interrupting, Tad.  But I would like to throw some entertainment on this program.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, Tad, make your point.  Well, the thing is that they're now saying they actually stole this.  They keep saying it's recovered silver. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  But it was stolen from some bank vault.  I guess they sent people in there in the middle of the night or something to sneak in and steal this silver.  That actually belongs to some bank here in – or, well, not here, but there in New York.  This numismatic humor.  You know what?  I don't even think the silver came from ground zero.  How do they prove that, you know?  I know.  How do you prove that one?  You don't.  It's just like when we all got a piece of the Berlin Wall when that came down.  Oh, yeah.  How do we know that?  I have a piece at home. 
[01:15:30]  I know.  How do I know that my little piece was actually from the Berlin Wall?  Yeah, I got a piece of the Berlin Wall.  It's a piece of chipped cement off the divider on the FDR.  That's what it is.  Hey, look at that.  Freedom.  Great.  But it gives you that little paper to prove that it came from the Berlin Wall.  And it's got to be true.  Authenticity.  Authenticity.  Thank you, Jim.  Certificate of – that's what they give, too, is a certificate of authenticity.  For what?  That it's a coin?  Yeah.  That it's round?  That it weighs something and you can roll it?  That the metal came from ground zero or close to ground zero?  No.  They're not fessing up anything. 
[01:16:00]  It was stolen.  I'm sure Fat Liz Taylor has a few copies.  God almighty.  She owns a painting that supposedly is an old Nazi booty stolen from the – from where?  From the Jews?  Were they stealing from anyone else?  From the French?  The French just gave it to them.  Yeah.  No, it's supposed to be somebody saying, hey, that's my painting.  It's my family's painting.  It was stolen.  And Liz Taylor just ain't fessing up.  No. 
[01:16:30]  She wants it.  She just rolls it up and puts it under that awful wig and walks around.  You are a disgusting fat body, Liz Taylor.  All right.  Give me my painting.  They're practicing being cruel and unusual.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Here's Opie and Anthony when they don't suck.  Good for what ails you, what what?  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, I felt bad for Earl because Earl's like, you know, I have this idea for the Black  Rock Coalition. 
[01:17:00]  I got a demo tape and a resume in my bag.  Eric Logan openly laughs and mocks Earl thinking he's joking.  And this has been Earl's baby for what, Anthony?  We've known Earl six years.  Oh, he's been.  It's been his baby for six years.  He wants to have a radio show on XM Satellite Radio called the Black Rock Coalition.  And basically it's black artists that do rock.  That's basically what he wants to do.  And then after you think about it and you get past the band Living Color, you're like,  hmm, what else are you going to play on this show, you idiot?  That's why the idea doesn't work. 
[01:17:30]  And I know there's a few of the black bands out there.  You don't have to, well, there's Fishbone and there's this band.  I know.  You were running as Hootie and the Blowfish.  You were running tape of Earl at the party?  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  You want to hear a little of that?  Hey, where are the white women at?  Oh, Jesus, Earl.  Oh, my God.  I think you got the other clip when Eric Logan kind of turned him down and said,  you know, we don't want the Black Rock Coalition on XM Satellite Radio.  I think this is what Earl said.  Oh, that uppity nigger went and hit me on the head with a shovel. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, no.  Did Earl hit Eric on the head with a shovel?  Well, that would be audio of Eric after Eric turned him down.  I was thinking of the audio of Eric.  Uh-huh.  Okay, you got it now?  Oh, Lordy, Lord, he's desperate.  Do what he says.  No, that's not an idea.  Do what he says.  No, no, no.  This would be the audio, right, of Earl, of Earl, after Eric Logan turned him down.  Right, right.  You got it now?  I know what that one is.  If I can find it.  If I can find it.  Okay.  All right. 
[01:18:30]  You got it?  Oh, maybe.  Okay.  Okay, so Black Earl's at the party, and he's pitching his Black Rock Coalition to the boss,  Eric Logan.  Yeah.  And he even told Eric, and this is the true part of this.  He goes, I have a resume and a demo in my bag.  And Eric Logan starts laughing openly, thinking this is a joke, like Earl's being funny.  So, and then Earl looked at Eric Logan and said this.  You don't want to hire niggas, that's all.  Oh, no, right there at Opie's big soiree. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, we got Earl on the line?  Oh, my God.  What is Earl doing awake?  What is Earl doing up?  Can we wake him up?  Yeah, of course.  It's not like he's going to work, lazy bastard.  Earl.  And he's shiftless to boot.  What's going on, Earl?  It's six o'clock in the morning, guys.  You sound exactly like you do at noon.  Yeah, who are you trying to kid?  Did you have fun at the house yesterday?  Yeah, I had a wonderful time, except for the fact that the Chet's lost, but...  Yeah, did you have enough to eat at my house? 
[01:19:30]  I didn't even think I ate anything.  Nah, no hominigrits out there for you?  Fried chicken or watermelon?  Nothing like that?  No?  Why didn't you eat any food?  I had to leave at halftime.  What did you have to do?  Well, I was actually working yesterday.  Stop it.  Over at NEW?  Yeah.  What did you have to do yesterday over there?  Give me a little rundown of your work day.  On a Sunday. 
[01:20:00]  Besides, bring back the one resume that you brought with you that you were hoping to hand off.  On a Sunday.  What did you have to do?  Well, I had to produce the Joe Cozzi show.  A what?  Joe Cozzi.  I have no idea what that is.  Yeah, what is the Joe Cozzi show, Earl?  Joe Cozzi.  He's on the air.  Oh.  So how do you produce a show?  You run the board.  Oh, he was board-opping.  Oh, so you were pushing buttons for Joe Cozzi.  Right. 
[01:20:30]  But you want the title of producer.  Whatever.  Oh.  3 a.m.  It's like 6 o'clock in the morning, guys.  I got no fight in me.  So you, like, push the button to turn his mic on and go, Joe, you're on.  You're on the air.  Yeah.  And then Joe talks, and then you go, boink, and hit the next record?  Among other things.  And they gave you this out of what, charity?  Figured you could use a couple extra bucks?  Oh, just did us a favor.  All right, so now you're admitting you're not really producing the Joe Cozzi show.  I bet Earl went there to do this for a day and didn't even get paid for it. 
[01:21:00]  I bet no one even knows he was doing this.  Oh, I certainly got paid for it.  Somebody probably wanted the day off, and Earl goes, I'll come in.  I'll do it.  Because he loves just going into work, because he doesn't have a...  Earl, I've got to be blunt with you.  They let you go.  Earl, they pretty much fired you, but you still show up for work every day.  No, I asked if I wanted to do it, and I said, sure, why not?  Did you get paid for it?  Of course I did.  You didn't see it. 
[01:21:30]  All right.  What kind of show does Joe Cozzi do?  It's sort of like, you know, classic dance show.  Classic dance?  Classic dance?  What's that?  Isn't that a waltz?  Classic R&B, stuff like that.  What'd you do, cue up the polkas, did you?  That sounds awful.  Doesn't that just sound horrible?  Classic dance?  You know what you should do for the Joe Cozzi show is go to the listeners and hand out earplugs.  This show stinks.  Wow, you're producing the classic dance show. 
[01:22:00]  You shouldn't say that.  Joe likes you guys a lot.  Your career's on a rocket ship.  I don't know who Joe is.  I don't know this Joe.  I don't know what he does.  Tell him you don't want to see him anymore.  He'll understand.  Believe me.  Yes, Steve?  No, Joe Cozzi is this really old school, like 20 years old school KTU jock.  They call him the Supreme Cousine.  Yeah.  Yes, Martini Steve?  And he was one of the, what is it, the transfers from KTU that Frankie brought over when he took over at NWN. 
[01:22:30]  But what does Earl do as the producer of the Joe Cozzi show?  He's board hopping.  He's board hopping.  So he's not really producing.  No.  Much like we're used to Earl not producing anything.  Earl's taking whatever shifts they give him.  Poor Earl had to wake up for this.  That does stink, though.  They don't give him any shifts because then he would be, as you said, shiftless.  Shiftless.  Are you shiftless, Earl?  Earl?  Did he hang up?  Oh, he got mad and hung up. 
[01:23:00]  No, he's right there.  He's not in there.  Earl?  Earl, at least he didn't fall asleep.  Earl?  Yeah.  All right.  What was going on?  It's old sleep and eat.  No, I just wanted to get a glass of water.  My throat was really dry.  That sounds like everybody at Opie's party yesterday.  Did it bother you that there was no food at that awful bash Opie's tree yesterday?  Just five of us, like, sterile idiots sitting there with no food?  Look at me.  I'm not Martha Stewart.  I was like, come on over and hang. 
[01:23:30]  No, I understand that.  It wasn't like Martha Stewart.  Martha's getting better service and jam.  Look, it wasn't like...  We were going to have better snacks with Rod Stewart.  Here, drink seven ounces of this.  It's not like I live in the middle of the desert and there's nothing around.  Exactly.  You should have had your party stocked.  I'm not that guy.  I can't wait to see the photoshopped.  We'll make it up on...  I can't wait to see the photoshopped of Opie's party.  Are you trying to show us his food?  We got one soda.  We got one beer.  And no legs of lamb. 
[01:24:00]  You like warm tap water, Doc?  So when I invite people over, I have to actually, you know, get stuff?  Usually you do that.  Usually you go out and you buy some stuff.  I have a few things.  I usually, you get the people there like, all right, you want to do a beer run, you want  to get food, that's all.  What are you going to hand out to trick-or-treaters, lint?  Oh, no, I'm the guy that hides.  Oh, you hide?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  On Halloween, I turn off all my lights.  This is my first year in a real residential, like, white neighborhood, instead of living 
[01:24:30]  in a Brooklyn apartment like I was, where you do, you just lock the door and hope  for the best, hope your vehicle is still there and not in flames when you go outside.  And, yeah, first time, so I'm thinking I'm going to have to get the candy so they don't,  you know, mess the house up or anything.  Very suburbia.  I'm going to have to do that for the first time ever in my whole life.  Oh, that sucks.  Believe that?  I turn off all the lights and hide.  Oh, look, it's a little ghost.  How are you? 
[01:25:00]  You're supposed to be a little pumpkin head.  What?  Your son has Down syndrome, doesn't he?  Jesus.  All right, let's say goodbye, Earl.  Let's move on here.  Boy, it was a little jack-o'-lantern head.  Earl.  Yeah.  All right, well, thanks for, I don't know.  Where'd you buy that gag tongue for him?  That's huge.  I hope that's not a choking hazard.  It glistens like it's real when it hangs out of his mouth.  Oh, little metals around the neck. 
[01:25:30]  Nope, I had a good time.  I didn't have any problems with anything quite.  Where'd you buy the Pete Rose wig?  All right, Earl, we're going to let you go.  All right, brother.  All right, there goes Black Earl.  SM 202.  The OPN Anthony Show.  I've said it before, I've worked for three homes of rock and roll for my fine radio career.  The Rochester home of rock and roll.  Huffle.  Buffalo's home of rock and roll. 
[01:26:00]  And Long Island's home of rock and roll.  And New York's?  No, AW was just...  It was the rock of New York.  Well, when we got there.  Where rock lives.  Oh, really?  It's not living on all the other rock stations across America.  What the fuck does that mean, where rock lives?  Where rock is on life support.  What about when we were...  That's what it should have been.  Yeah, all the jocks were over 60 when we got to town.  And then AF in Boston.  Yeah.  The only station that really rocks. 
[01:26:30]  That really rocks.  Oh, really?  The other ones just rock.  So when the other stations are playing Metallica, they're not really rocking?  What the freak does that mean?  The only station that really rocks.  The rock.  Anyway, the reason I cranked a monitor, I was just starting out in radio.  I was doing radio in Buffalo.  I was the overnight scumbag.  But during the weekends, I had a real time slot.  Like I would do afternoon drive, let's say 2P to 6P, which was pretty cool. 
[01:27:00]  Because then now people are listening to you.  Well, I almost got fired.  If Dillette has this song, I'll be amazed.  You ever hear the song by the Rolling Stones, Star F?  What?  Yeah, Star Star.  Star Star.  Okay, Star Star.  All right.  We did this promotion, and you guys, I guarantee, will laugh at me.  This isn't even a setup.  Yeah.  They came up with...  When I was working in Buffalo Radio at this station, they came up with this bright idea. 
[01:27:30]  The Rolling Stones were, I don't know, either coming to town.  All right, don't play it yet.  No, trust me, don't play it yet.  Look at this thing.  Don't go...  Don't play it.  He played the song.  He's like...  He dropped all the carts in there, too, Anthony.  He played the song.  He played this song.  We're going to make him read out of Rent Boy now for doing that.  Absolutely.  That is Eric's punishment.  Maybe that's what we should do.  That is Eric's punishment. 
[01:28:00]  Is that the way to do it?  Can I, can I, can I, uh...  Not yet.  I want to section off what he has to read.  Oh, yeah, okay.  Yeah, Eric, we got a punishment for you for jumping the gun, you overachiever.  Yeah, over-eager little beaver.  All right, so, um, the radio station came up with this bright idea.  You know how they're always going with these theme weekends?  We talked about the Rock Party weekend, the Four Play weekend, uh, uh, Aerosmith A to Z.  Gotta make a theme so it's more fun for the listener. 
[01:28:30]  Uh, the Firecracker 500.  Oh, 500.  Ooh, what will be number one this year?  Is it going to be Stairway to Heaven, or will it be Won't Get Fooled Again by the Who?  Ooh.  So, uh, they come up with this idea, I think because the Stones had another album coming out or something.  It was basically called Pick Your Stones Weekend.  Pick Your Stones Weekend.  Pick Your Stones Weekend.  They had all the laser...  You're listening to Pick Your Stones Weekend on the home of rock and roll.  Pick Your Stones Weekend. 
[01:29:00]  It's like...  Or Pick Your Stones Weekend.  Pick Your Stones Weekend all weekend long.  Oh, yeah, that's when, uh, production, uh, you know, then you couldn't be cool doing production.  It had to be like you didn't really care.  The Dry Delivery.  Right.  Pick Your Stones Weekend all this week.  K-Rock.  K-Rock.  K-Rock.  God, radio stinks.  On the only station that really rocks.  W-A-A-F. 
[01:29:30]  That was every, uh, piece of production for, uh, AF.  But back then, it was, uh, it was still the laser...  Oh, yeah.  This is the biggest thing ever to hit radio.  Star Wars sound effects.  Pick Your Stones Weekend.  So basically, the concept was, you call in, and you pick a stone song, and me as the stupid DJ,  I push the button, and you get to hear your stone song as you're driving around miserable Buffalo.  How about that?  Quite easy, right?  Mm-hmm.  Well, uh, they have a huge convention center in, uh, Buffalo.  And, uh, uh, the home of rock and roll was there, and they had the speakers on the van. 
[01:30:00]  It was like a car show or something.  Thousands of people there, not exaggerating.  It was just the thing to do in Buffalo.  There's not many things to do.  So, so everyone went to the convention center, and, um, uh, yeah, it actually was called the Fox, I guess.  The Fox was cranking out, uh, the radio station, and I was on the air.  So this girl calls up and totally fucked me, man.  And I almost got fired.  I had to beg for my job.  Um, literally, I think I even had, I hate to admit it, a little tear in my eye.  Like, look, I have no place else to go. 
[01:30:30]  I have no place else to go.  I did have to beg for my job.  Aw.  Um, so this girl goes.  Little Opie Schroeder.  Oh, champ!  I go to the phones, and, uh, you know, hi, the Fox.  Is this Pick Your Stones Weekend?  Yes, it is.  What do you want to hear?  Can I hear Star Star by the Stones?  Of course.  What's your favorite radio station?  The Fox.  That's right.  Uh-oh.  And I start the song. 
[01:31:00]  So back in those days, right, I would turn down the monitor and go, so anyway, and I would  have phone sex and talk to hot chicks and bitches on the phone.  So I'm, I have no idea what's playing at the convention center in front of a couple thousand  people, right?  Uh-huh.  And all of a sudden, the hotline is, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, and I'm, like, really flirting  with this Buffalo Betty, big time, and I have no idea what's going on with this song.  Uh-huh.  But we've got to crank it up right about here, I think.  Let's picture this.  Picture this commercial radio being played to thousands of people, right? 
[01:31:30]  I think it takes another, like, 30 seconds, right?  Mercy.  Basically, would have been an FCC violation.  Oh, my God, yeah.  It's coming up any second.  It's still a cool song, but, all right?  Listen.  It's okay.  This is the problem with doing radio on the fly.  We can prepare this bit, but.  But just remember, no monitor.  I had no idea.  I'm just watching the song Countdown. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, boy.  Dude, this is the rest of the song.  Oh, my goodness.  This is pretty much the rest of the song.  They say someone can, maybe we get an intern to find out how many times they say, fuck,  the whole thing played.  And now I'm like, so, what do you look like, really?  Well, I get off at, you know, 6 p.m.  You want to, like, meet on the corner?  I'll do the drive-by to see if you're not a fat pig. 
[01:32:30]  And, oh, yeah, I would make believe it.  I would tell them I'm driving a pickup truck and I had a Honda.  No, I'll drive by in my pickup truck and, you know, if they were hot, you stop.  If not, you're in a different car.  You just keep going.  So, what a creep.  So, this is playing at the convention center.  It just says fuck throughout the whole song.  I'm just the plebe of the station.  Listen, there's no, here, turn that up again.  That girl totally fucked you over.  So, the hotline is ringing, and it's counting down. 
[01:33:00]  The song's over.  And then Mike Benson, really good guy, he's still up in the area doing radio.  He's like, dude, did you, do you know what you just played?  Oh, no.  And then he told me, and I swear to God, I went white.  I went white.  And I saw my career, which was just beginning.  Just budding.  Just budding.  Like little, little, little 13-year-old African girl's boobies.  Yeah.  And our kids.  And I'm like, and then the next call, the hotline's ringing. 
[01:33:30]  It was him first.  And I swear to God, I went white.  I'm like, there's no reason why they would keep me.  I have no power.  I have nothing.  I'm just starting out.  And then sure enough, the next call was the hotline.  I want to see you in my office Monday morning at 9 a.m.  Don't you do it.  This is really me.  Begging.  I got nowhere else to go.  I got nowhere else to go.  I got nothing else. 
[01:34:00]  What is your problem, you insensitive asshole?  Yes.  But you know what?  I think the only reason they kept me, I was working like 70 hours a week and making like  12 grand.  So, it's cost effective.  I think that's the only reason they didn't fire me, because they were getting a lot out  of me, you know?  But can you imagine this playing to a convention?  How many times do they say it?  That's what I'm saying.  We'll have it in about 10 seconds.  Hang on.  It's unbelievable.  It's the whole song.  It's the whole song, Anthony.  Probably the most fucks in any song.  It's not like the who, you know, who the fuck are you? 
[01:34:30]  It goes by real fast, and that's it.  Yeah, well, who the fuck are you?  Just imagine this playing at a convention center for thousands of people.  And Mike Benson, he's like, I couldn't get the speaker.  Not only did he, well, I guess they couldn't turn the volume off in the van, because it  was loud, whatever.  So, he's grabbing the huge speakers off the van, jumping on top of the woofer to try to  muffle the sound, like, try to find where the volume was.  Yeah, because people probably knew what it was before the song even started.  When she requested it, and you went, yeah, people probably already started panicking, 
[01:35:00]  like, uh-oh, I know what that song is.  I was playing DJ.  Like, I made believe I knew the song.  That's why they wanted to fire us.  They're like, you sound like, I'm like, I never heard the song in my life.  I just thought it was a stone, you know.  We're playing any stone song?  And I just turned down the monitor.  Just turned it down, and I'm back on the phone flirting with this girl, and this is what's  going on all over the area.  She tried to screw you.  She knew what the song was.  All right, how many fucks are in that song?  This lyric page here is saying 35 times.  No, it's way more than that.  It's got to be more than that.  It's got to be more than that. 
[01:35:30]  They probably just do it once for the chorus, and they count it as one.  Yeah, listen, get an intern in the other room to just, it's quick.  I guarantee it's more than 35.  It's got to be.  I don't know, that's a lot.  35 is a lot.  Dude, that's the whole song, just over and over, going, fuck your star, fuck your star.  But why did they fire?  Did they realize that Sponge Buckley was irreplaceable?  When you're making $12,000 a year, yes.  You're irreplaceable.  $12,000 large, nice.  I was doing Midnight to Six, and then I would sit in on the Bear Man show all the way to 
[01:36:00]  10 a.m., Anthony.  The what?  The Bear Man.  He's a good guy.  The Bear Man?  He was the guy I told you.  I used to tape my sexcapades.  Yeah, but The Bear Man?  And then play it back for him, yeah.  What was the name?  His name was The Bear Man.  Ugh.  Why?  He's like the king of Allentown Radio to this day.  Bear like, arrr, or bear like you're ready to jump in a crock pit.  Huge guy.  In New York.  Huge.  Six, maybe 300.  Oh, okay.  That's when I was asking, why the Bear Man, and he's big like a bear. 
[01:36:30]  And I don't know what he's doing now, but back then he did some great radio.  He's the king of what?  Well, he's from like Allentown area, so.  The king of Allentown Radio?  Yeah, they brought him into Buffalo, and then he moved back home.  He does fine for himself.  I'm not saying he doesn't, but just that title is awful.  Well, that's the title I just gave him.  I don't know what they call him.  Bad smell, bad language, and now bad jokes.  This is the freakiest show I've ever been party to.  Because we're perverts.  Really?  Stupid.  So you know it's good.  That's why we love doing this radio show. 
[01:37:00]  Right.  Okay, terrific.  I'm going to put your mouth or a ball sign.  Buckle up, kids.  It's cool.  Let's just put it this way.  Sexual harassment, mostly.  Just shut up.  I was so offended.  No, listen, you twat.  Hit her over the head with a shovel.  If you did that, I would make love to you right now.  Come on.  People that get their news from O&A are the same people who watched Sesame Street until  they were 12.  Yes, precisely.  Guys talk about nasty stuff like this all the time.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats, because here comes a home run.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:37:30]  Say, Jim, what's real?  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  This is some sexual reference.  Let's see how our stoners are doing, Anthony.  We're going to do stoner spelling bee today for the first time on the new show.  It's PJ in D.C.  How are you, PJ?  Pretty good, pretty good.  Yeah?  How much pot have you smoked so far?  I don't know.  Maybe like 12 gravity bong hits.  12 gravity bong hits.  What's the name of your bong?  I think we've been calling it Chandra. 
[01:38:00]  Chandra.  Chandra?  Why Chandra?  Chandra Levy.  Chandra Levy?  You call your bong Chandra Levy?  It's a Chandra, but it's named after Chandra Levy.  Why would you name it after Chandra Levy?  It's local, you know?  It is local.  He's in D.C., so...  Did you find it in a park under some leaves?  Yeah, it was buried and we dug it up.  Maybe a nice...  With a Walkman attached?  A pair of bloody jogging pants next to it? 
[01:38:30]  Wasn't it pretty much a skeleton at that point?  Yeah, and just one jogging shoe?  Jesus.  Just looked like something Indiana Jones finds in a cave with a Walkman on.  All right, PJ, hold on, okay?  All right.  We're going to get this going right now, but...  All right, hold on.  Private Spong's name is Chandra Levy, sir!  All right, let's see.  Brian's from what?  Jersey, we said?  Brian, where are you from?  Yeah, what's up?  Where are you from?  From Jersey.  We're smoking pot in Jersey! 
[01:39:00]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!  Okay.  It's a Jersey showdown today.  We got three guys from Jersey and we got PJ from D.C.  Smoking a lot of pot there, Brian?  Definitely.  I've been up since 6.30.  We're loading the bong up, Wendy!  All right, you seem much more with it than PJ.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, do you...  Uh-oh, I'm hearing laughing in the background.  Yeah.  Are you in a car?  I'm at work.  Oh, you're at work?  What do you do?  Yeah.  What do you do for work? 
[01:39:30]  Pod, climb trees.  You climb trees?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  And you're smoking pot?  Definitely, yeah.  I'm pretty screwed today.  How high up do you have to climb today?  Uh, pretty high.  And why do you climb trees?  To chop them down?  Yeah.  All right.  Pretty fun.  It's pretty fun.  It's pretty fun.  It's more gooder than most jobs out there.  Hey, dude, you ever stumble on a hornet's nest when you're doing that?  Uh, yeah, we did.  Like, two weeks ago, we cut down a tree that had a whole bunch of bees on it. 
[01:40:00]  What happened?  Oh, we ran.  Are you getting ready to cut down a tree today?  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, this guy's going to be good.  I was going to bail on you, but I like you now.  All right.  Hold on, boy.  All right.  He's climbing trees.  He can break his neck.  Let's say hi to Steve in Jersey.  Steve?  Yo.  Hi.  How you doing?  I'm all right.  What's up?  Smoking a lot of dope?  I'm doing all right.  Yeah?  Do you have a bong?  No, dude.  I don't have a bong.  Smoking the joints?  No, I'm doing a bowl, actually.  I ran out of papers.  A bowl? 
[01:40:30]  All right.  Packing the bowl nice?  Yeah, yeah.  I got it.  Did you buy it?  About six in, man.  Did you buy the bowl, or did you make it in woodshop?  I whittled it out of wood, man, back in the day.  I made it in woodshop.  I made a bowl in woodshop once, Opie, and you can't do that because the teachers get mad.  So he asked me what I was making.  I said I was making a sculpture of a duck, and this is the duck's head because it was  a big round ball of wood, and then it had a little thing like a bill at the end of it.  With a little hole in it.  Yeah, and I drilled it out.  I love it, man. 
[01:41:00]  So we called it the duck head.  Did you name it Donald, man?  Yo, pass the duck head.  Yeah, I should have called it Donald or Daffy, but just called it the duck head.  Did you go through the stage where you had to smoke your pot through fruit?  I did that.  No, it's like an emergency thing.  You find stuff to smoke it through.  In college, it became all the rage.  Let's smoke pot through an apple.  I think we did the carrot.  I'm trying to remember.  That was out of necessity, like Ant just said.  I never wanted to do that.  A frat brother's cock. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  You know.  You don't get high, but I was out of the trees.  I was out of papers.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  I knocked it out of the faucet.  Really?  Yeah, you unscrew the faucet off of your sink, and it's already got the screen in the end  of it.  You put a little one hit in there.  Yeah, but how dirty is a faucet with all the gunk building up?  Yeah, it's your kitchen faucet.  Water's going through it.  How dirty could it be?  Two brothers, he would catch spiders and smoke them.  He would smoke spiders?  Yeah, he was convinced that he got a buzz off the spiders.  Could have been all the acid the guy was doing, too. 
[01:42:00]  I had a friend that worked in a machine shop, and he made this dual-bowled pipe.  It was two bowls that went down into a union and then came into a single tube.  Yeah.  So you'd fill two bowls at once, and we called it the dragon, dude.  Nice.  Because it looked like two dragon nostrils.  Spark up the dragon, man!  I think I know what else it looked like, too.  Two bowls with a thing in between them that you're putting in your mouth?  Might have been another name for that. 
[01:42:30]  Bowls, you idiot!  This guy's laughing his ass off.  We should just tell our audience to smoke pot every morning so we're funnier.  Smoke your dope.  All right, Steve, we're going to go with you.  Hold on.  All right, man.  He's all right.  And finally, Tim.  Want to start with Tim?  Tim.  Hey, Tim.  Yeah, what's up?  Tim's from Jersey also.  You're from Jersey as well.  Tim and Jersey smoking weed.  Well, we're smoking weed in Jersey and getting real high.  Yeah.  Dude, you don't do the whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
[01:43:00]  That's my favorite part of the Springsteen impression.  Dude, I fucking hate Springsteen.  Last night, I was smoking a bottle.  Springsteen blows.  Yes, he fucking does.  I sat through a show with my ex-girlfriend.  And it sucked balls.  TJ is saying, did Opie just say he smoked a carrot?  Yeah, I know.  They pick up everything, don't they?  I know they do, unfortunately.  All right, Tim.  Thank you.  We're going with you.  Stay there.  All right.  Let's get this going.  It's stoner spelling bee, Anthony.  We've got words in front of us.  Oh, what are these, political words? 
[01:43:30]  Well, is there a theme to the words that we're having people spell?  Very clever.  Where's the words?  Well, we want to be topical.  Hey, where's Jimmy's list?  I'd like to have some words.  Give Jimmy a list of the words.  No, no, no.  It's the O-N-A show.  No, I just...  O-N-A show.  O-N-A.  I just like to have a list.  O-N-A show.  And we've got the girl that wants to play What's in My Pants.  So this is going to be good.  We'll do like a round of spelling, and then we'll go to Dawn, and then we'll give those  guys time to smoke more pot. 
[01:44:00]  All right.  As Jimmy gets his words, let's go to PJ.  Anthony can pick the first word anyway.  PJ.  Give Jimmy a list.  Oh, it'll come.  No, they're getting it.  It'll come.  Can you do a hit on the air for us, please?  Sure.  All right.  Pack a bowl real quick.  Here's PJ.  Pack a bowl.  Smoking out of Chandra.  Little hair around the bowl.  PJ?  Yeah.  You smoking? 
[01:44:30]  I'm going right now.  Okay.  All right.  Here we go.  There's your words, Jimmy.  There we go.  Wow, PJ.  I don't hear anything.  A little slow this morning.  He's still on dopey.  PJ?  Oh, yeah.  He's got some.  Yeah, I just heard the carburetor let go.  Yeah, he's got some action going.  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh.  Wow.  That's a little harsh, huh?  Yeah, too big. 
[01:45:00]  All right, PJ.  Three strikes and you're out.  Is that how we're doing this today?  Three misspelled words and you are out of the competition.  All right.  PJ, here's your first word.  All right.  Oh, I get to pick first?  Yeah.  Okay.  Let's go with something easy, election-oriented.  Spell opponent.  O-P-P-O-N-E-T. 
[01:45:30]  Opponent.  Yes.  Opponent.  That's only valid if you live above 110th Street.  Oh.  That pronunciation.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  I stink.  Wrong.  Wrong.  All right.  You got one strike.  So we got to go two strikes because this is going to take way too long.  Especially at the speed he was going.  Yeah, we'll do two strikes.  Two strikes and you're out.  We'll cut our losses.  We understand.  Let's go to Brian in Jersey. 
[01:46:00]  Brian?  Yeah, what's up?  To the other guys on hold, get ready with your hit so we can go right to you, all right?  Brian, you want to do a hit for us?  What's that?  You want to do a hit of pot?  I can right this second, dude.  I'm at work.  Oh, you're the tree climber, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Are you ready?  How do you feel about being pepper sprayed?  When did you last smoke?  I was like a half an hour straight this morning.  At what time?  Like seven, quarter after seven. 
[01:46:30]  Is he stoned?  Well, you got to smoke the pot during the spelling, though.  Yeah.  We might have to cut our losses with Brian, I think.  You got to be stoned.  I am.  Yeah, but you got to smoke pot during the spelling.  During the contest, and then you're climbing trees, so.  Brian, you're out.  You're out.  We do have a...  No, you hear me.  No, click.  But through the magic of radio, we do have a backup.  His name is Andy from New York.  Andy, what's going on?  What's going on, man? 
[01:47:00]  How are you feeling today?  I'm good.  I got a bong, dude.  All right, let's hear your bong.  All right.  I hope I don't hang up on you guys.  It's hard to hit it and hold the phone.  All right.  What's the name of your bong?  Everyone calls it Budget, because it's like beat to hell.  Budget?  Yeah.  The budget bong.  The budget bong, dude.  Oh.  Smoking pot is a miracle. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Right on, Andy.  Are you working today?  You know how to hold it.  What?  Are you working today?  No, I don't work.  What do you do?  I go to film school, but I'm not going to class today, though, either, because I have an acting  class today, and I don't like to go to that one.  Where do you go?  NYU?  No, I go to New York Film Academy.  Who do you think is the finest director working today?  Oliver Stone, probably. 
[01:48:00]  Okay.  All right.  Um, you ready for your word?  Uh, yeah, sure.  Jim, why don't you give him a word there?  Um, uh, uh, how about optimism?  Oh.  Uh, uh, O-P-T-I-M-I-O-U-S-M.  Wow.  You.  Wow, Andy. 
[01:48:30]  What's the name of the film you're working on?  Stupidity?  You were going real well there, and then all of a sudden, uh, the wheels fell off the track.  Wow.  I'm optimism.  It's hard to judge how long that word is.  It certainly is.  It was not optimism.  Optimism.  You're very optimist-ouk.  That would be O-P-T-I-M-I-S-M.  Optimism.  Very good.  All right, Andy, hold on, all right?  All right.  Why he put...  All right, let's go to...  He was going so well.  He was doing so well, and he just had to add different letters. 
[01:49:00]  Let's go to Steve.  Steve in Jersey.  Yo.  How you feeling, Steve?  I'm all right.  I'm nice.  You want to do a hit or no?  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Ready?  Yep.  Yeah, I hear some, uh, action there, right?  Bubbling.  Yeah, bubbling.  Yo.  He's bubbling.  All right.  All right.  You ready for your word?  Wait, real quick.  I'm recording the Monster Rain song, Jim.  Oh.  I need to get some information to send it in, though. 
[01:49:30]  All right.  What, you're going to write a song about Monster Rain?  Yeah, but, yo, do you want it to be heavy, or do you want it to be all pussy and melo?  Well, I don't think it should be a particularly heavy song, sir, because...  Sensitive moment.  Yeah, I mean, Monster Rain is something that two boys of a young age share together.  They're afraid of the rain, and they have to hide under the porch.  It's a fear-based, uh, activity.  All right.  Just two boys staying out of the rain.  Yeah, we invite our listeners to write songs.  We like that.  We would like to hear a few Monster Rain songs.  Yes.  All right.  Uh, and why don't you give him a word?  I'm just going to play, like, host here today. 
[01:50:00]  Opie.  All right.  Let's look.  Another election word, Opie.  Okay.  If you would spell incumbent.  May I jump in and say, if you need it in a sentence, sir, you can ask for that, too.  I'm sure it will be one of them.  Oh.  All right.  Do you need it in a sentence?  No.  You said incumbent?  Yes.  Okay.  I-N-C-U-M-B-E-N-T.  Very good.  Oh, yeah.  Bingo.  Bingo.  Jersey.  Jersey. 
[01:50:30]  Jersey.  All right.  Let's hear it for Jersey.  All right.  We've got to go right to Tim.  Let's see.  Tim, another guy from Jersey.  Tim, how are you feeling?  I'm getting stoned in Jersey.  Hold on.  I was smoking a joint for you guys.  All right.  Very nice.  All right.  All right.  Give me a word.  I love how they have the pot smoke in their mouth sound.  You know that sound?  You kind of get this weird sound in your voice.  All right.  Give me the word. 
[01:51:00]  All right.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Hindrance.  Hindrance.  Hindrance.  When I was a boy, my father would say, Jimmy, be a help and not a hindrance.  H-I-N-D-R-E-N-C-E.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I suck at spelling and Jersey.  It's smoking weed.  It's A-N-C-E, sir.  You were very close.  Oh.  I'm sorry, Mr. Norton. 
[01:51:30]  All right.  Well, after the first round, PJ, one strike.  Andy, one strike.  Tim, one strike.  Only Steve is, well, Steve's leading, basically.  All right.  Hold on there.  Keep smoking your pot, all right?  XM202.  The OPN Anthony Show.  We got PJ on the line from D.C.  PJ, how are you feeling?  It's been a while now.  I'm sorry.  I'm pretty fucked up, man.  All right.  Yeah.  PJ has one strike.  If he doesn't get this word right, he's going to be out of the competition, Anthony.  Out of the competition.  What have you been doing for the last 20 minutes?  I've been taking mad bongers, man. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  Mad bong hits.  And did you like to guess what's in my pants today?  It was pretty good.  Pretty good.  Pretty good.  Pretty good.  He's relaxed.  He's stoned.  All right.  Are you watching TV or anything, or are you just kind of sitting there in your room?  I was playing Grand Theft Auto, but I'm just too hard to play it anymore.  Oh, really?  You can't get anything done?  Yeah.  I can't concentrate anymore.  He just stands around doing nothing, even in a game.  All right.  Well, Anthony, you got a word for PJ?  This could be it for PJ. 
[01:52:30]  Might be.  Well, I'm going to really test him.  Campaign.  Campaign.  P-A-M-P-A-I-G-N.  PJ's still in the game.  Wow.  I thought I had him there.  Very good, PJ.  Hold on the line, okay?  We're going to go to Steve in Jersey. 
[01:53:00]  Steve, how are you feeling?  I'm doing good, man.  All right.  Are you getting real stoned now?  Yeah.  I'm almost at delirium, dude.  Yeah?  What are you thinking?  What?  Almost at delirium.  Oh.  What are you thinking about?  I'm just sitting here with the phone attached to my fucking ear.  You got any thoughts going through that brain?  No.  Not really?  Not thinking about anything at all?  I'm just spacing out, looking at the ceiling.  How old a guy are you?  I'm like 29, man.  He's like 29, almost.  I guess he's 28 or 30.  You live in your mom's basement?  He's like 29, but not really.  Oh, my dad. 
[01:53:30]  You live in your dad's basement?  And he works at the deli.  Now, where do you work?  Huh?  Oh, man.  I work at a place in Jackson that Norton mentioned earlier.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Oh, really?  All right.  You ready for your next word?  Are you like one of those PSAs on TV where your father yells down the stairs to you and,  what are you doing?  Nothing.  No, I told him I was falling into this.  And he starts spraying the spray around.  Do you hide your pot smoke from your dad? 
[01:54:00]  No.  I have respect and go outside, you know.  But this morning, it was a little cold, and I kind of told him it was a special event.  Yeah, this is a definite special event.  It's good to hear you guys back.  All right.  Cool.  Who taught you how to do this stuff?  You, all right?  I learned it by watching you.  Is that you and your dad?  Yeah.  That's what you say when you get caught banging your mother.  Hey, are you a ride operator at a certain theme park? 
[01:54:30]  No.  Oh, okay.  I never said I worked there.  What's that?  I never said I worked there.  Okay.  You're right.  That's a great adventure, getting out of there alive.  You ever smoke pot with your dad?  No, dude.  Does he smoke pot?  He used to.  He told me some nice stories, but it'd just be too weird, man.  Yeah.  Did he ever catch you watching a dirty movie and then say, ah, don't turn it off and sit  down next to you?  Yeah.  It'd just be too weird, man.  Yeah.  Is he still married to your mom?  No.  No?  No.  Is he dating some hot pieces of asses or what?  He's got a nice Latino woman.  Yeah? 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  Do you want to do his chick?  No, dude.  I remember when my dad used to, like, I had to visit him on the weekends after my parents  got divorced and he'd have, like, his whore of the week and they were trying to, like,  it's so funny because they were really into my father, so they had to make like they liked  us kids.  But thinking back, they were just, you know, they were in their 20s girls, just some whore  bag, I guess, and my father was banging.  And they'd be, you know, oh, great, your kids, I have to spend time with your kids on  the weekend. 
[01:55:30]  And, uh, they were pretty hot, but just dumb as dirt.  So, Anthony, what are you interested in?  Like, we're going to spark up a relationship.  Yeah.  Like, I'm going to confide in her and, you know, she'll be mommy, too.  Can you just go bang my dad?  Yeah.  I'm playing Hot Wheels with my brother, Joe.  Suck on dad's Italian sausage and leave me alone, please.  I don't want to be bothered.  You're not my mommy.  And it was like a one-bedroom apartment thing.  Say hi to your new mommy.  New mommy.  It was a one-bedroom apartment, so I'd have to, like, look and see the bed that I knew 
[01:56:00]  they were having sex on.  Ugh.  It's like just an awful situation.  Your dad bringing home chippies?  Yeah?  He's just banging the Latino one.  Oh, a little Latina, huh?  He's doing all right.  All right.  Yeah?  All right, Steve.  You have no strikes here, so let's see.  Norton's got a word for you.  I'm ready.  Auxiliary.  Who?  Auxiliary.  Who?  Auxiliary.  What happened? 
[01:56:30]  Auxiliary.  Yes.  A-U-X.  I-L-I-A-R-Y.  Say it.  What's...  I didn't hear...  You got it.  Oh, did he say it right?  Yeah.  Okay, good one.  Yeah, I kind of heard him slurring.  He slurred the I-A together at the end.  Oh, I didn't hear...  Okay.  All right, Steve.  We're going to say goodbye to you for a little bit here.  Amen.  We'll get back to Steve in a minute.  Let's say hi to Tim again.  Tim in Jersey.  Hey, Tim, how you feeling?  I'm fucking whacked.  What?  What?  I'm fucking whacked. 
[01:57:00]  Whoa.  What are you wearing, Tim?  Uh, I don't know.  You fucking wear.  You fucking wear.  I just was only asking what you were trying to do.  What you were wearing.  Well, actually, I'm wearing nothing.  No.  Did we find out what he does for a living?  I'm an environmental technician.  I test dirt.  You test dirt?  Well, I test home heating oil tanks underground.  Oh, see if there's any leakage.  Yeah, exactly.  For contamination.  So, how's your buzz going?  I'm fucking whacked as shit, dude.  I smoked like an ace today. 
[01:57:30]  Are you?  Nice.  Are you thinking any weird thoughts that you want to share with anyone?  Yeah, actually, I had a really stupid idea.  Okay.  I have an FM modulator in my van, and so does somebody else in my company.  We put them together, and you can hear you guys on the radio in the house.  You should make stickers that say, put your modulators to 88.1 and spread the virus on FM as well as XM.  I've heard that this works.  I've heard that this kind of works.  So, if you're close enough to your house, it'll modulate to the radio?  You can be like a quarter mile away.  I've had guys follow me with their cars that don't have, you know, any XM equipment at all, 
[01:58:00]  and they put it on 88.1.  They're like up close to a quarter mile away, and they hear it.  Wow.  There you go.  I've heard this works.  Oops.  Hey, dude.  So, if you work within a quarter mile of your house, why buy a roadie, too?  Right.  All right.  Well, I got a Skype, though.  Buy the radio button so, you know, you can turn people on to it by having a bumper sticker in traffic.  Nice.  That's an 88.1 for O&A.  All right.  You got the boon box?  Not yet.  I'm waiting for it.  I'm waiting to buy it.  The boon box. 
[01:58:30]  I got a boon box.  A boon box.  Thank you, man.  That would have been a good one for Marion.  Yeah, that's good.  Tim, meet the boon box.  You ready for your next word?  Yeah, a boon box.  A boon box.  Yeah, give me a word.  All right.  Let's go.  If Tim gets this word wrong, he'll be out of the competition.  Go ahead, Anthony.  All right.  Let's go with Provisional.  Provisional?  P-R-O-V-I-S-I-O-N-A-L.  He's still in the game. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's still in the game.  All right, Tim.  Hang in there.  We're going to go to Andy in New York.  Andy, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  How are you feeling?  Pretty good, man.  Are you outside?  No, I'm in my apartment.  Oh, okay.  What have you been doing the last 20 minutes?  I've just been hitting the bong.  All right.  Kind of watching TV.  What are you watching?  Yeah, what's on TV?  I don't know.  I was just watching, like, election coverage, and then I just wanted to play PlayStation,  but then I just didn't.  So right now the PlayStation thing is just on. 
[01:59:30]  All right.  It's just watching the PlayStation screen?  No, I'm not doing that right now, like earlier.  All right.  You got any crazy thoughts you want to share with everybody?  Nah.  Nah?  Nah.  Really?  I just wanted to tell Jim Norton that I'm sad the tough crowd is gone, because that was  an awesome show.  Thanks, man.  We are, too.  I appreciate that.  All right.  With that?  I live right in the village, and, like, every night I see, like, the trees and, like, all  you guys walking around and shit.  Oh, come by the comedy show and some nights.  We're always there.  Yeah.  Yeah, I definitely will. 
[02:00:00]  All right.  Well, Jim, give Andy a word.  The word I'm going to give to Andy is, let me see here.  I'm sorry, Andy.  I had it, and I, oh, gorilla, but as in warfare, not as in the ape.  I thought you were talking about Patrice walking around.  Where's that bell?  I know.  All right.  Gorilla.  Andy.  Uh, G-U-R-I-L-L-R-I-L-L-A. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, no.  Sorry, Andy.  I was rooting for you.  We have to say goodbye to Andy.  Oh.  That's okay.  It was G-U-E, man.  You just missed it.  Yeah.  Andy, thanks for playing Stoner Spelling, B.  Thanks for having me.  All right.  Call back any time, all right?  All right, man.  Thanks, O.  Come to the cellar one night and wear a yellow handkerchief.  I'll come tonight.  Are you there tonight?  Uh, no.  I'm actually doing a benefit at the Stress Factory for U.S. soldiers, so if you're doing  your budget tonight.  I used to live in Jersey.  I used to go there all the time.  Yeah, I'll be there tonight only with Voss and a couple other guys for some benefit for 
[02:01:00]  the troops.  All right.  All right.  There he goes.  Thank you, Andy.  You like golden showers?  I just like to watch.  Uh, PJ from D.C.  We're back to you, buddy.  All right.  What's up?  All right.  You're doing good, right?  Yeah, man.  You want to do another hit?  Uh, I lost my lighter, man.  I can't.  I lost his lighter.  How did you lose your lighter?  It fell behind my couch.  He sounds really stoned.  You got any thoughts on that head of yours? 
[02:01:30]  No, man.  I'm just looking at the GTA screen.  What's on the GTA screen right now?  Just a couple of cops shooting a couple golfers, man.  Cops shooting golfers.  Very good.  Okay, Anthony, why don't you give PJ a word?  All righty.  Let's try.  Let me look.  Let me get a good one.  Gubernatorial.  Jesus.  What?  Gubernatorial. 
[02:02:00]  Let me use that in a sentence.  If you're a gay Israeli poet, you can mess up the gubernatorial election.  I have no idea.  Well, start with G.  I'll give you that much.  Yeah.  Let's give it a shot.  G.  Gubernatorial.  G-O.  Yeah.  U-B.  Okay.  You're still in it, buddy.  E-R. 
[02:02:30]  Uh-huh.  N-A.  Uh-huh.  No, N-E.  Right.  Right.  T.  T, good.  O-R.  E-L-A.  E-L-A.  Wow.  Wow.  You could not be more wrong.  You got the G right.  Yeah.  You got the G right.  That was it.  Oh, great. 
[02:03:00]  That was a good crash and burn, PJ, but we're going to have to say goodbye to you, all right?  All right.  See you later.  There he goes, PJ from D.C.  Bye, sweetie.  All right.  It's down to Steve, who's smoking pot in Jersey.  And Tim from Jersey.  That's it.  Steve, what's going on?  Nothing.  You know, my lighter ran out, and I went upstairs and got another lighter.  Yeah, you're motivated.  See that?  Yeah, he's still very motivated.  See, if he would have gotten up and gotten his lighter and smoked a little more weed, I  might not have given him such a hard word. 
[02:03:30]  That was a hard fucking word.  That's really a hard word.  Would you have gotten that one?  I don't know.  No, you don't know.  Don't give it to me.  Because it's goober-natorial.  Like, yeah, G-O-O-B-E-R.  No.  What?  No.  No.  All right, Jim, give Steve a word here.  Steve has no strikes, by the way.  Steve, the word is kernel, but not as in corn, as in rank.  Like clink.  Right.  Kernel, I'll see.  This word's always fucking hard. 
[02:04:00]  As in, I had misbehaved, so the kernel came in and gave me a mouthful of discipline.  I don't know, man.  C-O-N.  C-O-N, good.  Come on, bro.  Halfway there.  Halfway there.  Wait, hold on.  There's like an L in there, a couple L's or something.  All right, a couple L's, good.  Just put it all together now.  Come on.  C-O-N.  C-O-N, yeah. 
[02:04:30]  L-E-L.  L-E-L.  Yes, a kernel.  Oh, fuck you.  Conwell.  Conwell, clink.  I am Conwell.  Wow.  All right.  Well, that's your first strike.  You want to spell that one, Jimmy?  The word is C-O-L-O-N-E-L.  Colonel.  Colonal.  Oh, wait a minute.  Did I say the word wrong?  Yeah.  Colonal.  No, of course it's colonel.  You didn't say colonel, man.  Of course it's colonel.  We're going to keep both these guys on the line. 
[02:05:00]  Silly goose.  I swear to God, I just doubted myself.  What a dummy I am.  Tim, you're on the line with Steve.  Tim, here's the deal.  Well, if you get this word wrong, Steve will be the stoner spelling bee champion.  Okay.  There's no R in colonel.  Why is that?  Tim?  Doesn't Steve have to then spell a word correctly?  No, because it's the last of the second or third round.  Oh.  All right.  If Tim spells correctly, then we'll play another round.  That's what it's going to come down to.  All right.  Tim, how are you feeling, buddy?  I'm fucking pretty stoned.  You're pretty stoned. 
[02:05:30]  Okay.  You think you could keep spelling here?  Yeah.  Why not?  All right.  All right.  Okay.  Is Steve laughing at Tim?  What?  Where is your jersey Steve from?  I'm around Trenton, dude.  Oh, okay.  You're representing Central Jersey.  Where are you at?  Newton.  Yeah.  Representing.  Ah, Newton.  I used to hang out up there.  It's not a county, yo.  Was he just elected representative or something if he's representing?  I don't know.  I love when white guys represent. 
[02:06:00]  They're not representing anything.  All right.  Condo.  Represent 80% of the population, yo.  Wow.  Okay.  Who's getting this?  Tim?  Yeah, Tim.  Yeah.  Tim, your word is environment.  Oh, this is easy.  I'm an environmental technician.  Yeah, dude.  Well, sometimes it happens like...  Hey, hold on.  I'm kind of biased.  No, did you ever realize sometimes in Jeopardy, the guy that's the skipper of a boat gets  anchor for an answer or something?  It just happens. 
[02:06:30]  Well, why don't you make it fair and give Steve the word loser?  I mean...  Oh.  And just because he does the job doesn't mean he can spell it.  Oh, my God.  You want Tim to win.  I didn't rip it up.  You want it again?  I'm glad I'm not in this contest.  Third wheel would have been my word.  That's right.  Jim, cocksucker.  F-U-N.  Wait.  All right, Tim.  D-I-C-T-I-O-N. 
[02:07:00]  Ben fell.  Ben fell.  Whatever, Ben.  You almost fell off your chair laughing that hard?  Jesus.  All right.  All right.  Let's see if he can spell it correctly.  Are you really going to give him environment?  I have to.  I gave it to him.  What am I going to do?  Not give it to him?  All right, Tim.  Spell environment.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I-R-O-N-M-E-N-T.  All right.  That's cool, man.  Steve, that's not fair, is it now?  I would say it's a little unfair. 
[02:07:30]  All right.  Give him an easy word.  We'll give him an easy word.  What do you do for a living, Steve?  I'm in management, man.  All right.  Just to be fair, environment.  You think you can spell it right after the other guy?  I don't know.  Now, give him a word.  I will.  Hold on.  Steve, come on now.  I'm ready.  I'm trying to give him a nice, not too hard of one.  All right.  Here's one, because it kind of sums up the red and the blue.  Difference.  Difference?  Yes.  D-I-F-F-E-R-E-N-C-E. 
[02:08:00]  Atta boy.  There we go.  We're over that controversy.  All right.  It's back to you.  I want to recount.  How many strikes for each one?  One.  If Tim spells incorrectly here, then Steve will be the winner.  Uh-oh.  Back to Tim.  All right.  Tim?  Yes.  Your word is tester.  I'm kidding, of course.  Soil.  Dirt.  Stop it.  All right.  Go ahead.  All right. 
[02:08:30]  We will give you the word.  Left-wing fanatic.  Acquaintance.  Oh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Acquaintance.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  A-Q-U-A-T-I.  I don't fucking know.  Wait, wait.  That's if you're friends with water.  Wait.  A-Q-U-A-I-N-T-I-N-C-E-O.  Oh, my dear.  I'll say you don't.  Stand right.  Stand right.  Sorry. 
[02:09:00]  Now, does the next guy have to spell a word right, though?  Yes.  Because he's had one word less.  No.  That's it.  That's it?  Yeah.  No, he's got the...  Yeah.  No, he's got...  That was the end of, like, the fifth or sixth round.  I'm serious.  All right.  I'm done.  Tim?  Jimmy, about that show.  You can get single tickets?  Yes, you can.  Thank you very much, sir.  You're welcome.  Go on Ticketmaster, because they will sell after the announcement.  All right.  I'm fucking punching out.  See you soon.  I'll see you soon, pal.  Hold on, Tim.  We're going to put...  We should give Tim a prize, too.  I think so, too.  Are we going to have prizes to give away? 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, what prizes are we giving away?  All right, Tim.  We're going to give you some fine prizes.  I don't know.  An XMT shade?  What do we have there, Bear?  I'm curious.  What prize...  Swag.  We have swag.  Oh, boy.  When they say they got swag, that means...  That's crap.  That's crap.  We're giving you crap.  Give him the smelly wiffle ball bat.  No.  You can smoke dope out of it.  Make a bong.  I'll make a bong out of a wiffle ball bat.  All right, Tim.  Thank you.  There he goes.  We'll give you a pair of boxer briefs that Master Poe grappled in.  Let's hear it for Steve from Jersey. 
[02:10:00]  Thanks, guys.  And what does Steve get for winning Stoner Spelling Bee, Ben?  I just want to hear you say swag.  We'll find some of you.  We'll find some of you.  Oh, my God.  It's an honor.  It's an honor?  All right.  Well, hold on to the line, man.  You were a lot of fun today.  Any final thoughts?  It's just great to hear you guys, man.  All right, cool.  Spread the virus for us, right?  Take it easy, Jersey.  Yeah, Jersey.  Pete.  One Stoner Spelling Bee.  One Stoner Spelling Bee.  One Stoner Spelling Bee. 
[02:10:30]  Later, guys.  All right.  Hold on to the line.  There goes Steve.  What a guy.  The winner of Stoner Spelling Bee.  That was a lot of fun.  I've got stupid in stereo.  It's the OPNM show.  What's up, everybody?  It's your old friend, Jeff Ross.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Nothing to brag about.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:11:00]  In studio, one of our old pals, Jeffrey Ross.  He's playing Carolines here in New York City.  Tonight, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, lots and lots of shows for your tickets.  Call 212-757-4100.  Really fast.  We were talking about the homeless shopping spree.  We were talking about Feels for Meals.  Jay reminded us of another thing that we have like three or four bits we were never able 
[02:11:30]  to do at the old place, and we're convinced we could do just about all of them at the  new place.  Like, we never were able to do Feels for Meals.  Remember the bit, run around the park for Aaron?  Yeah, it was run around park for Aaron.  Run around the park.  Run around park Aaron.  Run around park Aaron.  Right.  There was a girl.  We were going to set her loose in Central Park, and you would have to run around the park  and find her. 
[02:12:00]  People didn't really like the acronym of run around park Aaron.  R-A.  Yeah, and find her.  They can figure it out.  They're not that stupid.  They're kind of...  And it was like, you know, when you play flag football.  She'd have some flags on her.  There wasn't going to be any tackling or anything.  Well, she wasn't going to be dragged into the woods.  But the whole gag was to surprise her, just have her walk around and jump out from a tree  and kind of grab her or something.  No, she was aware that she was going to be chased. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  You know, we set these lunatics loose.  She's got the flags like you have in flag football.  She runs around.  First person that grabs a flag off Aaron wins a fine prize.  Maybe a mi-fi that we're going to be giving away soon here on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Yeah, they didn't like that.  And the bee jar.  The bee jar has to happen.  We wanted to do a...  But this now gets back into fraternity hazing sounding stuff, doesn't it?  Yeah, that's true.  Lettuce.  Yeah, we wanted to take a jar and put a bee in it and have maybe six guys. 
[02:13:00]  We actually were going to do this.  They gave us a car to give away.  I forgot the car.  Oh, this is an Aztec.  The Aztec.  So, yeah, we were going to get four or five guys with, like, mayonnaise jars.  Place would be in each of the jars.  And then the first guy that got stung on his junk won the car.  Then they'd have to stick their junk in the jar and hold it there.  And the first guy that got stung won the car.  We were so close to doing that one.  And then they shut us down.  Maybe we can get this.  I was watching a documentary recently.  We'd have to get an Escalade for this one, though, on Japanese hornets. 
[02:13:30]  They're probably two inches long.  And we have, like, a three-inch wingspan.  If anyone's ever seen it, they're the worst creatures alive.  And if you could get them in a jar, you'd have to give away at least a $40,000 or $50,000 car.  And they sting?  Repeatedly.  And they attack other hornet nests.  And they murder them and steal from other bees.  Really?  And they're awful.  Do they wear bling?  No?  Yeah, they're actually H-O-top-apostrophe-nets.  Hornets.  Yeah, hornets.  Hornets. 
[02:14:00]  But the lawyers shut us down on that one.  I wonder why.  Well, they were worried about an allergic reaction.  Allergic reaction.  This is where you belong, fellas.  This is awesome.  Satellite radio.  Well, whatever it is.  It's radio.  And, you know, you can do whatever the fuck you want.  That's it.  It's kind of liberating.  Curse.  Is this the first time you've been on a satellite radio show?  I mean, darn!  Yeah, you showed them.  I can't.  It's funny.  We're used to it now, but when the old guys come by the new show for the first time, 
[02:14:30]  it's funny to watch them.  They're like, you can really curse?  You can get on mic and it kind of frees you down.  I'm not going to curse, just on principle.  That's good.  I never thought you should be fired, so I'm going to pretend we're still.  Thank you.  Thank you, Jeffrey Ross.  Pretend we're still back where we are.  You lucky cunt.  Wait, man.  I got to see.  See, wait.  We have something you're supposed to warn us.  Me, Mario.  Oh, no, no.  That's not it.  That's the wrong one, Opie.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Uh-oh.  Breathe.  Warning.  Warning.  C-word alert. 
[02:15:00]  C-word alert.  Warning.  Warning.  Because we found out that the women really don't like that one.  No.  That is truly the atomic bomb.  We try to give the warning before we let that one fly, but there you go.  Yeah, you let it.  I remember during my lovely marriage, Opie, in my nine years of marriage, my ex-wife, that  word was the single worst thing you could ever say, ever, ever, ever.  She would shut down.  To her or just in general?  In general.  In general.  I mean, in general. 
[02:15:30]  No.  To her?  Not even an option.  And there was a couple of times toward the end of the marriage where she would be bitching  at me for something.  Are you going to say it?  And I would...  Yeah.  Warning.  Warning.  C-word alert.  C-word alert.  Warning.  Warning.  She would be bitching at me for something.  And I would try to gauge how loud I could say it so that I felt like a tough guy saying  it, but she wouldn't hear it.  Because I'd be like, keep bragging, you fucking cunt. 
[02:16:00]  And there was one time she was like, I heard, what?  What?  What?  Came in and was just unloaded.  Now you know why?  Just unloaded.  Now you know why the homeless were wearing all your clothes.  I know.  Hey, come on.  There ain't a guy that's been married that doesn't at least think the word.  You say it all the time.  This is why they hate it, because they know you mean it when you say it.  It's hard.  There's never like...  I was only saying that like, well, you're kind of creepy. 
[02:16:30]  You know what I mean?  There's no way to get around me.  It's not like bitch, which is like, you know, some girls enjoy being a bitch.  Yeah, I'm a bitch, and I'm proud of it.  100% Italian bitch.  Waka waka.  You know, chicks don't wear the shirt they should wear.  Maybe it'll like...  Let's desensitize it so it becomes like D.Va.  You think?  Eventually on VH1, it'll be like, VH1, cunts.  Sorry, I missed the warning.  We got the warning out there, though.  Maybe someday.  Elton John. 
[02:17:00]  Bette Midler.  Barbara Streisand.  VH1.  Cunts.  Hey, yeah.  See, isn't this new radio fun?  This is all right.  It's all right, huh?  Someday.  This is rad.  And then you'd have all the black women, but they're spelled C-U-N-T-Z.  All right.  We saw you at the Donald Trump ropes.  That was fun.  We had a good time in the nosebleed seats.  Yeah, the VH1 seats.  We want to become better friends with you so we can get better seats. 
[02:17:30]  It's not working with Rich Voss.  Rich Voss gets all excited to say, yeah, I got tickets.  For the roast.  I went to a roast, and I was Jeffrey's guest at the Hugh Hefner roast.  What a night.  And I had great seats.  I was able to see Hef drool.  I was close enough to see the Hef drooling.  His hot blonde models.  Seven of them.  I went to the after party and saw Rob Schneider leave with one.  Yeah.  Who then got fired.  One of the girls got fired.  She's back.  Is she back?  Yeah. 
[02:18:00]  I saw her at the Halloween party.  She's like, eh, it's not me.  I'm not going to let some old man tell me who the fuck.  And I was like, all right, well, I guess not, because you're back.  Why'd she get fired?  For leaving?  For fooling around with somebody.  Yeah, yeah.  He's supposed to be in Hef's coffin by 2 a.m.  There's the Hef.  He's got the image, so he's supposed to have these girls.  It looks bad if some of Hef's girls are peeling off to be with Rob Schneider.  Oh, you mean it was one of his personal seven. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You know, he had seven girlfriends.  One to put it in, and the other six to move them around.  Seven.  I had a great time at that roast.  You know, and we had the good seats.  Like I said, great seats.  So where'd you sit for the Trump roast?  Oh.  Why weren't you on the date?  Where was the roast?  What hotel was that?  The Hilton?  Yeah, we were at the Sheridan.  Did you see that?  Did you see the big screen?  Yeah.  For the people that were in the back of the floor that weren't close enough to the stage  so they would turn around to see what's going on on the big screen?  You were behind that.  We were behind the screen. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  No.  No joke.  We were right on the corner of that screen.  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  It's the kind of pull a rich boss has.  And he was so excited.  He's like, don't blow it off.  These tickets are $500 a piece.  $500 a piece.  He paid nothing.  Of course.  Forget it.  He did great that night.  He made me...  I was proud of him.  He did.  I was proud.  He did a good job.  He was very...  There were a couple of people who just killed, and then there were people that just ate  it.  I kind of was in between.  I was a little off.  You are probably one of the best people at a roast I've ever seen. 
[02:19:30]  Well, thanks.  You come there prepared.  You got a lot of funny stuff.  And I don't know what happened that day.  I was a little off.  You were good.  It wasn't like you ate it.  Right.  You didn't come out in a nun costume.  You know, I came out with a bad attitude, which I usually can overcome, but I was just  sort of...  You did?  I was off.  Yeah.  I don't know.  That room was weird, though.  Why?  It took forever to get started, too.  The goddamn introduction of the dais was forever.  Freddie Roman goes up and introduces like 50 non-speaking B celebrities. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  And Katie Couric and like three other people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So that took forever.  They finally get to the roast.  You're like, enough already.  Yeah.  Stewie Stone was very funny, though.  I'd never seen him do anything before.  Oh, he's great.  Yeah.  All the guys on it were great.  That was the one thing.  But I don't know.  Has anyone...  By the time I got on, all the Trump hair jokes were shot, man.  That's another thing.  Trump, you have your set jokes, and everyone pretty much does them.  So the earlier, the better, I guess.  Dude, Robert Klein.  I think he's a brilliant comedian.  He's one of my favorite comedians growing up. 
[02:20:30]  He was an influence, and he just hit a tough night.  He had a bad set.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was really rough.  He was doing his act.  He panicked, I think.  Some of these guys were just doing their act.  Right.  What happened to Klein?  Who was the guy that was doing his act?  Oh, my God.  Norm Crosby.  Norm Crosby.  He was?  I don't remember him being there.  He would seg into just his jokes.  You know, Donald Trump's built a lot of buildings, and there's a construction worker, and he gets  into an elevator.  And he does a difference.  It's like, he's going up to try to get gigs at Trump Marina. 
[02:21:00]  Right, right, right.  I'm going up to try to make you guys laugh four months later when I see you.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, you don't give a crap.  I love that.  Yeah, what's Trump going to inspire me?  You know, there's a...  Has anyone ever come close to punching in the face?  Penny Marshall.  Penny Marshall?  Really?  Interestingly enough.  She was angry?  And I was a little afraid of her, because she's a fucking crazy...  Yeah.  Yeah?  What did you say about her that pissed her off?  I guess it was the Rob Reiner roast.  She was married to Rob Reiner, and I said, I don't even want to roast Rob Reiner.  I mean, how do you even make fun of a guy that married Penny Marshall? 
[02:21:30]  That's a great line.  How do you...  You know, what was your wedding song?  How much is that doggy in the window?  Oh, boy.  And then, like, a couple months later, I was roasting the Maloofs, the Maloof brothers  who own the Palms and the basketball team, the Kings.  Yeah.  We're in Vegas, and she's a big basketball fan, so she's there.  You know, they flew me in, and I'm, you know, there.  I'm roasting.  I'm doing this roast, and as I get to the mic, before I even start, she's, like, shouting 
[02:22:00]  me down.  Wow.  Not trying to be funny, but to me.  Is she on the dais?  No, she's, like, in the front row.  In the front row?  With Vince Neil, and they're both all wasted.  And she's already gone up and, like, humiliated everybody in the room, including herself.  Yeah.  Is she blonde?  Yeah.  She was horrible.  She did these, like, hateful jokes where she made all the blondes in the room stand up, and  I'm, like, you fuck Gavin Maloof, you fuck George Maloof, and this and that.  And then I go up, and she starts heckling me, and I was, I was, like, what were you, Lenny  or Squiggy?  Oh, shit.  Shut up. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, that's good.  And then they wouldn't let me go to the, interestingly enough, there was, like, a little after reception,  and they said, well, maybe, I guess she's a high roller there.  A little more star power.  They definitely pushed me out a little bit, but.  Wow.  And they wouldn't let you go to the thing?  Well, they sort of ushered me somewhere else, yeah.  Was there ever a line you just didn't want to do?  Oh, wow.  And you knew you had to do it?  Like, you were just freaking going, oh, God, I can't believe I'm about to say this?  Yeah, there was one of the Trump roasts that I let go.  Which one?  I said, you know, about all the women he's banged, all the hot young. 
[02:23:00]  I was, like, he's the only guy I ever met who's probably banged 72 virgins without having  to blow himself up in the name of Allah.  And I was, like, this is not going to get a laugh.  It's going to get a groan, but I really want to read it in the paper tomorrow.  Yeah.  That's all you care about.  It's a great joke, man.  I want my line in the New York Post.  Exactly, and it was in there somewhere, so I was happy.  Even Voss made the paper for that roast.  A couple times, yeah.  He's famous now.  I know.  We did the Jay Moore roast on NBC together.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, yeah.  He was part of Last Comic Standard. 
[02:23:30]  You were part of one of the episodes that aired.  That's great.  I was on, like, the third to last, me and Triumph guest star on the third to last episode.  Is he really like that in person?  Triumph?  Is he really a sock?  I've had enough of that fucking sock, to be honest with you.  I like that.  Any guy that can hide behind a podium and not actually face someone when they're shitting  on them.  I mean, I do not respect that as a comedian.  We have to look people in the eyes.  Yeah, you know, I'd rather put a puppet on my hand and go, wacky, wacky, and then put  a little dog thing in there.  I make poop.  Oh, you cut it out.  Get him out of here. 
[02:24:00]  He's incorrigible.  Oh, fuck yourself.  He's got eight nipples and six jokes.  Why do you hate him so much?  I don't hate him.  I think a lot of the jokes are great.  But I watched him trash Rickles one time, and it just really made me want to bite his face.  You're thinking of Lisa Lampanelli.  Oh, you're right.  Let's try out the insult, Moose.  Another secret message, Anthony.  JC, Mike, go.  I don't like secrets. 
[02:24:30]  He's giving out secret messages to the troops.  Hey, you guys want to get Francine in here?  Yes.  Of course we do.  This is fun.  Francine was our old intern.  Yeah, he remembers Francine.  Are you allowed to chew on the air?  What's the story with anything?  Anything goes.  Anything goes.  The ozone midget sighting of the day.  Wow, who saw this coming?  Chris in Jersey, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I've got a midget sighting for you.  All right, let's hear it.  I had a hernia operation.  Yeah.  Somebody screwed up. 
[02:25:00]  They put me under anesthesia, and just as I'm about to go under, in walks a frigging  midget with a damn surgical cap and gown on and a stupid little stethoscope dangling  between her knees, reaching up for syringes.  That might have been the anesthesia, man.  Yeah.  You're saying your surgeon was a midget.  I don't know that she was actual a surgeon that cut me.  But that was the last thing you saw before you conked out?  That was just about the last thing I remember.  You sure it wasn't some doctor that brought his kid on, like, bring your daughter to work 
[02:25:30]  day?  That just scares me that somebody has to stand on phone books to be able to slice me open  and fix me.  I don't think they use phone books there in the ER.  You should be grateful.  Yeah, maybe a stool.  But do you want those little fat fingers suturing things in your heart?  Oh, no.  Those little clumsy fat hands?  All right.  Well, thanks, Chris.  Cocktail drinks and a needle in front all day.  All right.  Meanwhile, back at the show.  All right, we've got Francine in the studio.  Hey, guys. 
[02:26:00]  Hi, Francine.  Do you know Jeffrey Ross?  Hi, Jeffrey.  Nice to see you.  A very successful comedian.  He's playing Caroline's all this weekend.  Why are you shocked?  Oh, I thought you said I was.  Oh.  Ah.  Are you?  No.  You know Jeffrey Ross, a beautiful black girl?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Francine used to be our intern.  Now she's doing stand-up.  Do you know Jeffrey Ross, though?  Yes.  He's like the king of the one-liners and other things?  Yes.  He's legendary for his roasts over the years?  All right. 
[02:26:30]  How long have you been doing stand-up?  A year.  A year you've been doing it?  Mm-hmm.  And how many times do you gig?  I think I get one maybe once a month.  Once a month?  Once a month.  You go.  Mm-hmm.  So whenever you get your period, you're like, I better get on stage.  No.  I got some ragging to do.  Where have you performed?  Mainly at stand-up New York.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  It's fun.  What do you do?  Like, open mic night?  Do they have that there? 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  I think they reopened it, but I usually do, like, real shows.  Real shows?  Ooh.  You mean you go in there and say, I would like a spot?  No, they make you bring, like, ten people, and then you can do a show.  Ah, that old show.  I remember that from the old band days.  You've got to bring some people, man.  Yep.  That used to be how your radio show was at the old place.  You had to bring ten people.  Bring ten people.  That's true.  I got ten people listening.  Can I come on?  Now it's, like, superstar. 
[02:27:30]  And, uh, describe your act.  Um.  Are you a cross between someone that's out there ready or doing your own thing?  What's the deal?  I do my own thing.  I just talk about, like, what I'm angry about or what happened to me on a date or something like that.  Are you an angry comic or is it more, like, fun lifestyle issues or?  Probably more angry.  More angry?  Yeah.  Yeah?  You're not the sweet kind of girl that gets up there and does that act?  Never.  All right.  Well, we have Francine's tape.  So, wait, once a month you go up for a year? 
[02:28:00]  So you've been on stage, like, a dozen times?  No, um, that's for the show shows.  But for the open mics, I do, like, three open mics a month.  You should be going up three times a day.  I work all the time.  Oh, all right.  Yeah.  I try.  You need to get up as much as you can.  Yeah, exactly.  Look at that.  The two veterans telling the rookie what to do.  You've got to get out there, kid.  Yeah.  Norton didn't tell her anything.  He just reiterated what I said.  That pretty much is right.  I just kind of piggybacked on his suggestion. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  Norton's clearly going to be kissing up to her during this thing.  Oh.  No, I just can't.  I already see what's going on.  Now, Francine, we haven't heard this yet, but I just want to ask you, are you confident  in the material?  It's pretty good.  Yeah.  And would you be able to take criticism without bursting into tears and jumping through that  window and running away?  Yes.  I can take it.  Oh, she paused.  I saw a little pause there.  No, I can take it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Okay. 
[02:29:00]  Well, let's start the tape, see what happens here.  You may fire when ready, sir.  Oh, my gosh.  She's like a little Catholic school girl when I met her.  That's who she looked like, and now we'll see what she looks like.  Francine.  Let's hear it for Francine.  She's the other one, Destiny.  Give it up for Gladys.  Gladys is so sweet.  Francine, Gladys, we're a PTA meeting.  No last names, no.  Now, where was this tape? 
[02:29:30]  This was at the comic strip.  The comic strip?  Mm-hmm.  And you were very excited about Gladys.  Was she fond or something?  I knew Gladys for about since I started, and she always tried to give me good advice.  All right.  She does give good advice because I used to do her open mic a long time ago.  Gladys?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  She used to host an open mic.  Very sweet lady.  Mm-hmm.  Older lady?  A little bit.  Okay.  With a name like Gladys?  Of course.  So, you're really tired of.  I'm tired of these women who wear these stupid t-shirts, you know, these, like, sexy and 
[02:30:00]  delicious and all that crap.  I was walking through Grand Central.  Let's go ahead on this shirt.  It said, silicone free.  I'm looking at her.  She's 5'1", 450 pounds.  I was like, believe me, nobody's wondering.  You need to be wearing a shirt saying Haagen-Dazs whore.  Or a buffet queen, sweetie.  That would actually apply to you.  And I... 
[02:30:30]  You know what's weird?  Who's the guy?  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Who is it?  That's one of your ten.  Because we did listen to part of this tape before we hit the air, and we hear that guy  through the whole thing.  That's part of your ten people, isn't it?  No, it was a bunch of people, but...  Is that your dad?  No, he's this guy that always gets on and talks about how he's a virgin and he's never  got laid.  Oh, so he was another comic?  Yeah, but that's all he says every single time.  I'm a virgin.  We're like, okay.  Yeah.  All right, so we got...  What was the punchline of that joke?  The punchline was Haagen-Dazs whore. 
[02:31:00]  Right.  So you should do something else, like, you know, instead of silicone-free, like, lettuce-free,  you know?  Oh, that's...  Oh, wow.  Like, real advice from Jeffrey Ross.  Wow.  Who saw that coming?  I didn't see that coming.  Is that bad?  That's good.  No, that's good.  That's good.  Tell me to...  I'm an expert.  Lettuce-free.  That's good.  I'm trying to help a young hot chick.  All right.  Thank you.  You guys are all, like, sucked in to the fact that she's a hot black lady.  You haven't mentioned any of that to the viewers, by the way.  You're just letting her come in here.  Francine.  No. 
[02:31:30]  We've talked about how hot she is.  Plus, they know Francine from the old show.  Yeah.  Actually, a lot of them does.  And she's got a weave.  Is that a weave?  No, it's braids.  Braids?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  That's all your hair, though?  No.  No.  Where's your start and end?  Mine ends about here.  It's a bob.  A bob?  Yep.  All right.  Back to the tape.  And I don't even care anymore.  Fuck the fat chicks.  Fuck them all.  They hate me.  Okay?  It's not life all.  They all hate me.  You know?  And it's funny how they all hang out with each other. 
[02:32:00]  You know?  They'll be sitting around, you know, at work in their little fat chick convention.  You know?  Trying to give each other, like, diet tips and shit.  Talking about, I'm trying the Atkins diet.  Like, you're eating McDonald's.  You're on the Fatkins diet.  Yeah.  Fucking life.  The Fatkins diet.  Okay.  Play on words.  All right.  Play on words.  Jeffrey, anything?  I like that one.  That was an actual joke.  Thank you.  I like where it's coming from, too.  That you're trashing fat chicks the minute you walk on stage.  Yeah. 
[02:32:30]  Look at Jim.  He's going right after his fatties.  Jimmy's going to say nothing bad.  I wouldn't, you know.  Bobby Bigrigger.  Too new.  Hey, gentlemen.  What's going on here?  Hey.  Jim, do me a favor.  Just leave that book down on the counter for a second.  I was wondering if I can get Cindy Brady's autograph.  Are you saying that Francine may sound a little like Cindy Brady?  That's not her.  I just turned my radio on.  I thought it was Cindy Brady.  Oh, my goodness.  This guy's calling you Cindy Brady.  I'm really sorry.  Jim, make me a good time.  What would you do to that guy if he said that while you were on stage? 
[02:33:00]  Is she from the Brady Show?  The Brady Show.  That's what it is called.  The Brady Bunch?  Yeah.  He thinks you sound like Cindy Brady.  I don't remember watching that show.  That's what you would say back to him if he said this from the crowd?  Like, you're going to need some chops because people are going to go after you.  What would you say?  What would you say?  He would yell out, wow, you sound just like Cindy Brady.  I'd say I don't know who she is.  I hate it when people talk during my sight. 
[02:33:30]  That's the way to hit back hard.  That's right.  That'll shut him up.  Take it easy on him, Francine.  I'm sure he'll have nothing else to say after that.  Wow.  That's right, sir.  Point one finger and three are pointing back at you.  All right.  I don't like to make fun of people a lot.  The song kind of goes up.  Okay.  You're right.  I'm an ass.  I don't even know how many fingers I have.  Where was this tape?  It sounds like a Port Authority restroom.  Hold on, let me talk to your six-fingered Kumia.  It's the comic strip. 
[02:34:00]  The comic strip.  The comic strip.  All right, let's go back to the tape.  But I don't like to make fun of people a lot, but I do.  But I was a really ugly kid, you know, growing up.  And I knew I was an ugly kid because I had this really cute little brother.  And everywhere we went, they only comment on him.  So they come up to my mom.  They're like, oh, my God.  Immaculate.  That's my mom.  Like, he's so adorable.  He is so cute.  Just look at him.  And then they look at me, and they'll be like, well, what's this? 
[02:34:30]  Well, what is it?  Can I pet it?  I'm like, fuck you, Grandma.  You were there for delivery, Skank.  You know it's me.  She's bashing Grandma.  I ride the Metro North, and it's probably a lot.  Is it me, or do all Spanish people know each other?  That guy is annoying.  Wow.  You've got to tell him to shut up during your set.  He's an ass. 
[02:35:00]  He really is an ass.  He's helping her timing.  He's keeping it as if she was killing, you know?  Yeah, he's making it sound like I'm doing good.  He's keeping it as if she was killing.  He's helping you along, but it's really annoying.  How many people were in the crowd?  I'd say about 10 or 12.  Oh, 10 or 12.  Yeah.  And was anyone else reacting, or just that guy?  It was that guy and maybe three or four people in the front.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And then what were the other people doing?  Waiting to go on.  Are they waiting to go on? 
[02:35:30]  Actually, I was the last person.  Oh.  Yeah, so they were just pushing.  You were the closer.  Nice.  Yeah.  I think you're doing great headlining.  Thank you.  I'm noticing a lot of cursing.  Fucking phenomenal.  You know, you'll be sitting in a car by yourself, you know, and there'll be, like, one Spanish  person next to you, and, like, one other Spanish person comes in.  It's like, oh, yeah, I can't help.  Come on, stop.  Whole fucking conversation.  That's quite a Gene Stapleton impression. 
[02:36:00]  You might want to work on the Spanish thing.  Ah, gee.  I could Spanish.  Yeah, but that impression didn't sound like a Spanish person.  Yeah, maybe you should use your little, you know, think that Spanish out a little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Again, I like the fact that she's trashing fat people.  She called her grandmother a skank.  She called herself ugly.  And she's shitting on Spanish people.  I kind of like where it's coming from.  And she's making a fat guy laugh, which is always a good thing.  Right.  I think it's like, oh, y'all, kids, help!  Come on, stop! 
[02:36:30]  Whole fucking conversation.  But that doesn't explain why, like, they have so many kids.  It's because they're so fucking friendly, okay?  Although, I will say, I've rethought the Spanish thing.  Keep it the way you have it.  Because even though it doesn't sound Spanish, it absolutely captures how annoying it is  to hear two Spanish people babbling at each other.  That's exactly what I hear when they talk.  Just two babbling idiots.  You are really trying hard, aren't you?  Yeah, I really am.  He wants to do you.  No, it's not about banging. 
[02:37:00]  I think that's actually, you know.  He's going to sacrifice good radio, so I hope you give him a good banging.  That's not true!  What am I going to do?  He can't settle for a date.  He doesn't need to...  We're never going to have sex.  He'll settle for a cup of coffee after the show.  I don't want to come to coffee.  Let's just acknowledge that Norton is going to be completely...  I actually just wanted to trash Spanish people.  Out of this bit.  He likes his coffee like he likes his women.  Under 18.  That's probably what they're always talking about.  So, is it me or do the dykeiest broad have the biggest titties? 
[02:37:30]  I swear.  Ralphie Mae's dying in the background.  Well, observational humor is always good.  How do you know they're dykes if they have big boobs, though?  Because they usually look like guys.  Yeah, they're dressed like dykes.  Well, that's just because they're fat.  No, and they have their haircuts, you know, their side cut thingy and...  Yeah.  There's a definite dyke look, Opie.  Yeah.  All right.  And they all have big boobs?  Most of them, yeah. 
[02:38:00]  Okay.  I swear, you know, they try to hide it with, like, their sports bras and oversized t-shirts,  and that shit never works.  Does that mean that the queerest guys have the biggest dicks?  And McGreevy and all his bras are like...  What's the visual there?  What's the visual?  Um, I pretend like I'm wagging my dick at everybody.  Oh, there you go.  Like, ha-ha, look how big my dick is.  Yeah.  Save that for your auditions. 
[02:38:30]  Really?  No.  A little dirty.  Too dirty?  No.  Waving your dick?  Maybe.  Waving your dick in the air like you just don't care.  What do we have here?  Yeah, that would be a shame.  You ever laugh so hard you fart?  You're like...  And everybody keeps laughing and pretends like nothing happened, right?  And, you know, the other person's thinking, did she just fart? 
[02:39:00]  All the time.  All the time.  Oh.  Oh, someone agreeing with you in the audience all the time.  Yeah.  It's funny because it's true.  Yes.  I got you.  Yeah.  All right.  She's got confidence in her material, that's for sure.  This is good.  All right.  I was just saying.  Hmm.  So, I grew up in the suburbs with this mom that's really crazy.  My mom's really overprotective like my virgin friend over there. 
[02:39:30]  And the funny thing about suburban parents is that they're so much into their career that  they don't pay much attention to you.  So, like, they just pretend like nothing's going on.  My mom comes into my room.  She always has a stupid question.  Um, Francine, um, I was going through your bedroom the other day, and I found here this  long, uh, thick, uh, vibrating device.  I'm like, uh, for the last time, it's a massager from Brookstone. 
[02:40:00]  Get out of my bedroom.  She always goes in, you know, and she can come into my room.  I can be on my knees.  I swear to God.  Um, sweetie, what are you doing?  I'm like, I'm checking for testicular cancer, mom.  Oh, okay, I get it.  I get it.  Okay, I was lost for a little while there.  So, what you're saying is your mother, uh, would ask ridiculous questions, even if you  were giving a blowjob, uh, in your bedroom.  Yeah, she, yeah, she does.  I swear to God, until you said that, I didn't get it. 
[02:40:30]  I thought she was reaching back, like, playing with herself and checking herself.  Right, right, yeah, that's what I thought, too.  At first, I didn't know there was someone in the room with you.  Either way, it's hot.  Right.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Yeah, I, I...  Jimmy, you're such a kiss-ass.  I'm not a kiss-ass.  You're the worst.  Here's the thing.  You stink.  No, it's not, she's doing it a year, it's not bad for a year.  Honestly, it's really not bad at all, but, uh...  If she was a guy, I wouldn't trash her.  Yes, you would.  No, I would not if it was a year.  If this was ten years in, that's different, but you can't trash somebody that's doing it  a year.  She's got confidence.  Thank you.  She has confidence defending her material, which is good, too. 
[02:41:00]  Yes.  All right, we're almost done here.  Gotta go back a little here.  There you go.  Jimmy, what are you doing on your knees?  I am praying he doesn't have testicular cancer.  I'm like, but sweetie, nothing.  Get out of my room.  I am fucking busy.  Okay?  Get out.  More importantly, your mom allows you to give guys blowjobs in the house while she's cooking  dinner?  Right. 
[02:41:30]  Well, no, actually, she'd usually be at work.  A lot of comedy's based on real-life events.  Yeah.  Are you blowing guys in the bedroom while mom is cooking Thanksgiving dinner?  No.  Well, actually, probably like once, I think.  Oh.  Yeah.  Maybe once, because she was upstairs and we were downstairs.  What state are you from?  What suburban area?  Maryland, mostly.  Wow.  Oh, Maryland?  Yeah.  I guess that in my head.  That's weird.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  I really did. 
[02:42:00]  I don't know why.  Now, what about this material when your mom comes and sees you?  Oh, really?  Oh, she doesn't listen to X-Men?  No.  She's not here.  What about when you're at the comic strip?  Yeah.  Has she seen the live?  You have eight people and you need two more and you're like, Mom.  I made like some CDs once and she found it.  She found some of them and she was really annoyed and disappointed.  Disappointed?  And she got over it, though.  Disappointed that you're trying to do comedy?  No.  Most of it was too much material.  Like, she heard about all my ex-boyfriends and what I did with them. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, boy.  You should say it's just for my act.  We've been getting away with that for years here.  Right.  It's just the show.  I go home and someone will question me about something.  I'm like, nah, it's just for the radio.  That chick wasn't a 10.  She was a 4.  She was ugly.  I didn't touch her.  Nothing happened.  No.  Oh, she's already heard most of it, though.  Yeah.  Yes.  Just say this is not based on anything.  She'll probably kill me if she heard it.  All right.  I'm going to time that up. 
[02:43:00]  I'm going to continue.  I've got to think of shit this time.  So, did you guys hear about the AIDS outbreak in the porn industry?  Why was anybody surprised about this?  That's why.  But, I mean, like, the news had, like, programs and shit on us.  And they're like, these are, like, professional whores.  Are you serious?  Because I would have loved to be an interviewer out there in, like, Hollywood.  It would have been a really short interview, first of all.  Hello, everyone. 
[02:43:30]  We'd like to invite Amanda Hugginfuck here.  Welcome, Amanda.  I just have a couple of questions for you.  First question, Amanda.  Let me get this straight for all our viewers.  You fuck complete strangers on an everyday basis for a living.  And you were surprised that you caught the AIDS.  All right.  Final question from Ms. Hugginfuck.  Throughout your illustrious career, did you not see this coming? 
[02:44:00]  Not on your face or in your mouth.  Nowhere.  Thank you, Ms. Hugginfuck.  That concludes our interview.  I'd love to shake your hand, but I won't.  Back to you, Bill, with sports.  Thanks, guys.  That's my time.  Oh, wow.  You end with it as a closer.  End with a character.  Thank you.  End with a character.  Did you like it?  Well, I think you need a stronger closer, right?  Or a sweeter, more endearing closer than, like, fuck, I'm not shaking an AIDS person's hand. 
[02:44:30]  Thank you.  Good night.  Fuck you.  Good night.  You want to end really, really strong, because that's what they're going to remember.  You want to leave them with a huge laugh.  Let's kill the AIDS patients.  That's my time.  You didn't see this coming?  Not on your face or in your mouth.  You guys have been great.  I've been great.  Get home safe.  Fuck AIDS.  Back to you, Gladys.  Don't forget to tip your waitresses.  You're working hard tonight.  Yeah.  I didn't expect to do that long of a bit, so I thought I was going to be off before I even did that one. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, that one kind of went on a little bit.  Why'd you stay on?  Because it was still rolling, and she wasn't back.  You know when they leave the room, and then you're just on stage with the mic.  You've got to keep talking.  That's like without a net.  Yeah.  I must say, you definitely have confidence.  You don't sound nervous up there.  I think sometimes you break into some curses as like a crutch.  That's a nervous thing.  That's a crutch.  A nervous crutch.  Hey, fuck.  You know?  Shit.  We fuck.  Shit. 
[02:45:30]  Why curse?  Shit.  All right.  Here.  Jimmy?  It's not cutesy garbage like I thought it would probably be.  It's kind of vicious.  I like it.  I mean, it's a year in.  You can't judge somebody when they're first, they're on stage X amount of time.  It's hard to judge.  You actually can judge, and I think I give you high grades.  Yeah, but a lot of guys stink in the beginning.  That was really good.  A lot of guys start off funny for the first couple of years, and five years later, you  see them doing the same shit.  There's certain guys I used to do open mics with that were like, God, this guy is great.  Yeah.  And then you see them a few years later, and you're like, ugh, you see really, like  in hindsight, you realize they stunk, because they're doing the same shit. 
[02:46:00]  Unfortunately, you're a girl, which means you can only be so funny, which is not very  on stage as far as female comics go.  Really?  Why?  I don't know.  It's just something that happens.  Female comics, for the most part, really suck.  John Rivers and Sarah Silverman.  Some of them are very funny, but I never...  Sarah Silverman is very funny.  Yes.  Okay.  So maybe you can be an exception to the rule.  I think there are exceptions.  The rule is, 99% of the time, female comics are so bad.  And we really assumed, you know, and the guys even were like, you know, you can be tough 
[02:46:30]  on her if you want before you came in, and now you have the respect of four funny guys  who want to get in your pants.  Yeah, because we...  Part of it is that women are nurturing, and very rarely is humor and nurturing.  Humor is the opposite of nurturing.  It's cutting, it's vicious.  I mean, that's why women are, to me, nature-based, not as funny, because it's not their instinct.  Their instinct isn't to laugh if you fall and crack your head is to help pick you up.  But guys are like, ah, you fucking idiots.  All right.  Well, let's hear it for Francine. 
[02:47:00]  She did a good job.  Thanks, guys.  We were ready to trash you, but, you know, we've got to stay honest on the show.  It wasn't that bad.  Not at all.  You kept it tight, which is always good.  Yeah, we'll look forward to another tape from you down the road, okay?  Thanks, guys.  Hopefully, it'll be something we can really mock and hurt you with.  Where's your next open mic?  Want to plug it?  Open mic?  Well, wherever you...  I'll probably...  Today's Thursday?  Yes.  Or wherever you're performing.  I think I'm going to be at stand-up on December 3rd.  What was that? 
[02:47:30]  Oh.  And the Brady Bunch.  There we go.  And we're hanging with Jeffrey Ross.  We're going to take a break.  Jeffrey Ross is at Caroline's.  A lot of shows.  For tickets, 212-757-4100.  As we go on a break, Anthony, a mash-up here.  Give us a little break to eat cereal and stuff, okay?  What is it?  Beastie Boys and the Beverly Hills Coffee.  Where's the other mash-up you guys have?  Which one?  I don't know.  There's one here that says Nas and Black Sabbath.  Oh, boy.  I'm just curious.  It goes on forever, though. 
[02:48:00]  What song is it?  Ben, you want to ride this in when it starts really sucking, just go to break?  I don't know, but there's some buck buck in it.  Yeah, it's like six minutes long.  Oh, what song is it?  It's Black Sabbath and...  No, just turn it off when you're done.  War Pigs.  Yeah, Ben will figure it out when it sucks, all right?  Oh, you're not a big fan of War Pigs?  I love War Pigs, but I mean, it's like I've heard it.  It's like a stairway to heaven for me.  I've heard it so many times.  Oh, gotcha.  It's not that great.  It's a great song, but it's just...  This mash-up isn't that great, though.  Oh, then don't play it.  Oh, by the way, by the way, I've seen your act, Jim. 
[02:48:30]  Love it.  And you goof at one point at somebody rhyming something, and if it's the same word you're  rhyming with the word that it rhymes with, and it's the same word, that's bad, isn't  it?  Sometimes.  Yeah.  Unless it's in War Pigs.  Unless it's War Pigs.  Masses and masses.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's the same word.  But no, no, no, no.  What happened to your genius there?  First of all, those are not the original War Pig lyrics.  The original War Pig lyrics were far different, and they had a priest being burned in a fire, 
[02:49:00]  and they were forced to change, I believe, by Warner Brothers.  So this might have been the last minute.  Oh, he's actually got some.  That's great.  And masses and masses, we understand why.  You know, it used to be, cast the priest into the fire, and I think Warner Brothers was  like, eh, eh, not on this record.  Well, who knew?  There you are.  There's the explanation.  Son of a bitch has an answer for it.  We'll try this.  I don't think it's that great.  Ben will ride it when it sucks.  Okay.  He'll get us out, and we'll continue with Jeffrey Ross.  Stay there. 
[02:49:30]  Do you realize who you hired?  He's a disruptive influence.  Anthony.  He happens to be a dwarf.  What a horrible game.  Our new bosses said, you guys can get as crazy as you want.  They keep creating new ways to celebrate mediocrity.  The Opie and Anthony show.  It's psychotic.  He's up on the gay shit.  Oh, Jerry.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  When Jeffrey Ross is in the studio, well, he is, ask him about the time he played Pratt  Institute years ago. 
[02:50:00]  I remember being at a show where some crazy freshman pulled a knife on Ross because he  didn't like a joke.  Really?  I guess that's why he did it, but apparently the kid was trouble.  I remember being on stage, and the kid was, well, before the show, I was early, he was  like floating around the stage, sort of going, you know, just sort of like weird, like  Willard type of a kid, you know?  Willard.  Yeah.  Did you see the new version, the remake of Willard?  Yeah.  Yeah, with the, what's his name?  It was so creepy.  It was so creepy.  Glover.  I can't look at rats.  No? 
[02:50:30]  Ever since I had a skateboard through Kenmore Square in Boston at five in the morning to  do morning radio in college.  Rats?  Rats everywhere.  There's a lot of good ones in the city.  My skateboard would scare them, and they would just, they'd just go.  On my way to work, did I tell you the story on the air yet or no?  No.  On my way to work this morning, actually, I'm walking by a building, and there's like  a garbage jutting out, and there's a guy walking towards me, and a rat ran right over  his foot and into a little nook in the building.  Oh, that's so creepy.  A big rat right over his foot.  That's the scariest shit ever.  Yeah, and this kid's just sort of like, you know, like, I think he like flashed it from 
[02:51:00]  the front row, and I got a little weird, and I didn't want to like, I don't know.  Flashed it?  Like, hey, look what I got?  Yeah, I saw it.  I didn't, I don't know if I drew any attention to it or whatever.  Like, I don't remember, I was sort of, this was a long time ago, I was probably a little  nervous and green and whatever, and then for some reason, like, I started teasing him  a little bit the way I've been known to do, and he came up, and he like, had the knife,  and I like, I didn't know, there's like hundreds of witnesses.  So it's just strange, do I take this guy down, do I just walk off? 
[02:51:30]  Came up on the stage with the knife and brandished it.  I was actually open for Jeff on that show, he was on the side of the stage, but he was  looking at, like, behind a pole looking at you, and you're like, eh.  How is this guy allowed to just walk around on the stage, though?  It was at college, it wasn't like it was a big theater stage, I think it was like one  of those things where you just kind of step up and you're on the stage.  It looked like a student union situation.  Got you.  And he was behind a post, and Ross is on stage, and this guy is behind a post to Jeff's stage  right, and I guess he was flashing the knife that the audience couldn't see, but you're 
[02:52:00]  like, hey, well, this guy has a knife.  It was really uncomfortable, and I didn't see the knife.  This guy has a knife.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, he's going into the guy with the knife, bitch.  Yeah, where's the punchline?  What?  He usually has a witty punchline.  I'm in fear for my life.  Ha, ha, ha.  Take my knife, please.  Please.  Oh, that's...  And what happened?  He just wandered out, right?  They escorted him out.  No, no, no, they took him out.  And you stopped the show.  You were like, ah, I'm not performing here. 
[02:52:30]  You got really uncomfortable.  Ha, ha, ha.  I'm not performing.  Yeah, that was the end of the show.  You were like, you would weird it out by a minute.  I didn't go back on?  No.  No, come on.  Really?  It was like last?  Yeah, it was me and then you.  There might have been one more, but I know it was me and you.  I just thought it was last.  There was me and you.  Yeah, it was Tillis.  Jeffrey, also, we're finding out that you broke your hip since we've been off the air.  Yeah, that's why.  How the hell do you break your hip at your age?  That's like something old people do. 
[02:53:00]  Too much time at the friars.  I threw myself in front of some six-year-old cunt ice skating.  Wait.  Dude.  I don't like the warning thing.  I like just the shock value.  Just blur them out.  He likes the shock value.  It was Christmas Eve.  I'm in Bainbridge Island, Washington.  I visit my sister and her, my nephews.  You know, it's like a Hanukkah.  Nothing going on.  My nephews are like, we want to go ice skating.  They're like four and eight.  The only ice skating rink's an hour north towards Vancouver.  Christmas Eve.  Middle of nowhere. 
[02:53:30]  We're driving to this ice skating rink.  We have to pass through.  We pass through like a hospital, basically, to get to the rink.  My sister's joke goes, this is the worst hospital in Washington State.  Oh, no.  I just happens to mention that, you know.  Two hours later, I'm in the emergency room, being surrounded by nurses with like reindeer hats and Christmas sweaters.  I want no part of this broken Jew, you know.  It's not like I'm some comedian.  I'm just Jeff, you know, some guy laying on a stretcher. 
[02:54:00]  Mr. Ross.  It was Mr. Lipschultz.  It was like, it was horrible.  I'm like, well, I'm ice skating.  I don't really know how to ice skate.  I haven't ice skated since I was a little kid.  It's like a couple hours in, and the hot chocolate food place is like closed.  The ice skating's free, so everyone's on the rink.  There's just thousands.  It's just so crowded.  And I finally get off the wall.  I'm getting the hang of it.  They're like, one more lap.  One more.  And it's like, they're going to close for Christmas. 
[02:54:30]  You're on the last lap.  And some little six-year-old girl, like, fell in front of me, and I didn't want to fall,  and I threw my legs up just to avoid crashing into her.  And femur.  Wait, wait, wait.  Ow.  This is, I'm going to get all.  Good morning, America.  You landed on your leg or your hip?  My hip.  Side of my hip.  And I didn't know right away.  I was sort of in denial, and they like, I was like flipping around like a flounder on the ice,  and then the guys started to come, and then they were like, clear the ice.  It was like, there's literally hundreds of people watching me. 
[02:55:00]  Did you embarrass?  Oh, that's the guy that ruined our last lap.  He wasn't embarrassed.  He was in pain.  Now, what broke, actually, your hip or your femur?  Femur.  You broke the femur.  It's like a, kind of like a cap to it, like a head of it.  Yeah.  And it just snapped off.  Oh, wait a minute.  The part that goes into the hip bone, where it kind of connects the ball joint.  Right, that's it.  The ball part of your femur snapped off.  Clean break.  Clean break.  So, we didn't think it was that big a deal. 
[02:55:30]  They dragged me into like a penalty box, and I'm there for like five.  I go, just give me a minute, I'm fine.  Just give me a minute, I'm fine.  You couldn't walk at all, though, right?  Your leg, you couldn't.  And then, after a couple minutes, I realize that I'm sitting in the penalty box, but not,  I'm sitting like this, but I'm literally holding myself up with my arms, because I can't put  my butt down, no matter what.  Oh, man.  And I start sweating, and finally I go, you know what, call an ambulance.  I don't know what's going on here.  I'm not getting up.  And then they start putting me, they want to put me on a stretcher, and I can't, I can't  even get the skate off.  It's like, it's, wow. 
[02:56:00]  And like, I'm pretty good with that.  Oh, God.  And so, the paramedics like call a doctor, and they go, we have a guy here, so-and-so  age, so-and-so this, so-and-so that, we're going to give him a shot, we're going to give  him some morphine, and I go, oh, my God, this is for real.  They're going to drug me and get me off this ice.  It's pretty bad.  So, I go to the hospital, I'm laying there, and I don't know what's going on, and this doctor  walks in, he's got his big Christmas Bill Cosby sweater on. 
[02:56:30]  He wants, he just walks over with this look on his face, and he looks at the x-ray, he  looks at me, and he goes, young man, you are fucked.  Oh, no.  That's what he said to the doctor.  Get out of here.  He goes, you have a broken hip.  He goes, I've been a bone dog, an orthopedist for like 20 years, I've never seen a guy with  a broken hip before, who's not like 70 years old.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And, you know, they do a little pushing and pulling and prodding, and I have three pins,  three metal pins in the side of my leg.  So, how long were you in that hospital?  Five to four days. 
[02:57:00]  Then I was three weeks up at my sister's house, couldn't move.  Are you back to normal, sort of?  Can you do stuff?  I can sort of, like, I can walk, I can't really run, I can, like, have sex with, like, on an  angle.  Well, anybody out there with a slanted pussy, I'm your man.  Chinese chicks are looking good.  Did they say what happened?  Did you just hit it at the complete worst spot?  I kept saying, what do I have, like, soft bones, whatever that disease is, you know. 
[02:57:30]  I said, what's the story?  Like, why me?  And the guy goes, you went ice skating.  You had a trick fall, bad fall, weird thing.  Don't go ice skating.  That's what happened.  Yeah, stay away from that ice skating.  Just a fluke accident.  Jews should not ice skate.  That's why I don't ski or ice skate, man, exactly for that reason.  It's just, I know it's going to happen.  It's scary.  You never think it's going to happen.  And even my sister was like, oh, you skate.  I don't feel like skating.  You take the kids out.  More logic from Jim Norton.  Doesn't want to go ice skating or skiing, but he'll lick a girl's ass that he doesn't  know.  No one ever broke their hip licking a girl's ass. 
[02:58:00]  That's right.  You might break your hip when you've got the hip and you can't walk anymore because you're  so skinny and weak.  I mean, it's all cyclical, I guess.  But, yeah, I mean, look, it could be worse.  I mean, you could have fallen on your back.  I mean, look at stupid Christopher Reeve falls off a horse.  I mean, you know what I mean?  It's like you could, a lot worse shit could happen on a fall if you smash your neck, so  it sucks, but you're fine.  In the scheme of life, I'm pretty lucky.  I mean, it's just the worst thing.  If anything, it'll keep you from getting, doing anything else stupid, like ice skating, ski.  That's not a stupid thing.  You tried it in a real day's work.  Also, the other day, by the way, can I say that none of the comedians, we all talked about 
[02:58:30]  it, we found out Jeff got hurt, and none of us were surprised it was a broken hip.  Not one comic was like, what?  He broke his hip.  They're like, oh, man, I hope he's all right.  But no one was like, what?  I remember Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Kimmel, like, call me up, and they go, well, you know,  they go, well, it's really sad, but it's kind of funny, too.  I'm like in a hospital on, you know, Christmas.  But you're chewers.  Who cares?  Well, I mean, you know, it's my vacation, too.  You guys love our Christmas holiday. 
[02:59:00]  They can't put that in a cast or anything, right?  No, they have three pins and crutches.  And then they give me, like, the physical therapy manual, and all the diagrams are like  80-year-old people, like, how to get your pants on, how to put your socks on.  Have one of your grandchildren.  You're not.  I know.  It's like endless, you know, I was doing a figure eight.  There's like a million ice skating jokes.  Dude, how did you fly home?  After three weeks, you were still kind of straight-legged, or you could actually bend your legs? 
[02:59:30]  I was on crutches, but I wanted to, that was another thing.  I was on crutches, and I'm recovering at my sister's house, which was kind of nice, because,  you know, you're out of L.A., you're out of New York, you're just in Bainbridge Island,  Washington, spending some quality time with my sister and my nephews, and my brother-in-law,  who I've known since I'm a little kid.  Kind of digging it, then I get an invitation, you know, you're cordially invited to the  world premiere of A Long Came Polly, you know, the Ben Stiller, and I'm in the movie, right, 
[03:00:00]  so I'm like, oh my gosh, I'm never in a movie, I've got to get out of this.  Wait, you were in that movie?  Exactly, so I go down.  I saw it on a flight, I'm trying to remember what you did in that.  So I go, I fly down, you know, like, red carpet, I get all dressed, I haven't been anywhere,  I'm on crutches walking down the red carpet, the publicist walking me down,  and I have, like, two scenes in the movie where I sing, like, the wedding band lead,  a really funny role, and I'm so psyched to be at this premiere, it's like my first time,  you know, out in public in almost a month, I do, like, 20 interviews down the red carpet, 
[03:00:30]  I get inside with my girlfriend, got a great seat, not in the movie.  Cut out.  Oh, okay.  They never told me, so there I am, like a schmuck on crutches.  Oh, no.  Completely cut out of the movie.  Just going to a film.  That's all right, because the movie wasn't that good anyway.  I pretty much went to the movies that night.  The basketball scene was one of the funniest scenes in recent comedy. 
[03:01:00]  The scenes are on the DVD, they're pretty funny.  Oh, they are?  Yeah.  Oh, you made the DVD.  There you go.  And you also were telling us during break that you went to Iraq.  We were just talking to Jimmy about his Iraq experiences.  Yeah, you went to Baghdad, right?  Yeah, you went before I did.  I think you went in the Iraqi summer, right?  I went in September of last year, sort of during those Jewish holiday times, right before  they caught Saddam.  Yeah.  But we didn't just go to Baghdad.  I went with Drew Carey, who's an ex-Marine.  So we did, like, a psycho trip to Crete, Masul, Bakwaba, Fallujah, Blackhawk. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, you did Fallujah?  I didn't do Fallujah.  We went to all these little bases, you know, where all our transport engineers live, like,  20 miles outside each city.  And some of the bases were just a couple of dozen people, and some of them were, like,  8,000 people.  How embarrassing would it have been, though, to see Drew Carey and Jeffrey Ross in one  of those videos, please don't kill us.  Oh, that's horrifying.  I know, just sitting there with the flag behind him.  It never would have been.  It would have been, like, Drew Carey and others.  Yeah. 
[03:02:00]  Right?  Plus, where are they going to find an orange jumpsuit that Drew Carey could fit into anyway?  It was a pretty intense trip.  We did a show in front of Saddam's birthday palace in Crete, you know, and they've been  getting shot on every day there by these Saddam loyalists, and suddenly they defiantly put  up this big stage and lit it up.  Great.  Light it up.  And you're on the stage.  Suddenly the night.  Doing comedy.  It didn't seem that bad.  Our hotel, the Al-Rashid Hotel in Baghdad, did you stay there?  All bases we stayed on, because you had already been there and it already happened. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah, our hotel got hit with a mortar and stuff.  While you were staying there?  Yeah, and we went back and stayed there that night.  That was scary.  Excuse me, I'm trying to sleep upstairs.  Could you stop blowing this up?  And, you know, I went to the house.  You called the front desk.  How is hotel service there?  Do you have room service?  There's not.  Can you call down and go, hey?  Can I get an AK-47 ASAP?  Please.  And a pot of coffee?  There's a hole in my hotel room. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, I mean, I got dehydrated one day.  We did a show in a flatbed truck in, like, you know, Al-Ramidi Air Base near Syria.  Eleven of them was, like, 120 degrees.  And afterwards, I'm, like, dizzy.  They took me to the hospital, pumped me up with some saline.  It's tough over there.  Yeah.  I gather.  Support our troops.  It's USO.org, or the Wounded Warrior Project.  We went after Saddam got caught, so they kind of kept us, I think, a little closer to the,  because everything, all the insurgencies were kind of starting up, so they really didn't 
[03:03:30]  have much freedom to move like that.  No.  No.  Blackhawk, who did they want?  It's going to get worse before it gets better.  Yeah, it has.  Like Dick Cheney says, we're going to have elections in January in Iraq, even if we have to kill  every Iraqi person.  Yeah, they're sticking to that date.  Vote or die, motherfuckers.  It's going to be vote and die.  Vote and die.  Vote and die.  That's where Puffy should be with his campaign, because that's the real deal over there.  So how are the Blackhawks?  Did you guys, when you were in Blackhawks, I know in the C-130s, you flew the C-130s  too, right, when they do the combat maneuvers. 
[03:04:00]  Did they do them in the Blackhawks?  I heard that they're vicious, man.  Yeah, the Blackhawks fly really low and fast, so they can't get shot at.  I have it all on video.  I made a film.  You did?  I'm trying to sell.  You showed it at the Hamptons International Film Festival, and it's pretty good.  How was that festival?  I loved to see that.  Very, very cool.  It was really neat to be a director in a documentary film festival, you know.  I don't like the Hamptons, though, but...  Well, I didn't go...  I went to a lot of...  No, I'm not going to be out there.  No, there's a lot of...  Well, you know, just people.  I don't know.  It was cool. 
[03:04:30]  Very good.  Excellent, man.  All right, Jeffrey, we're going to see you at Caroline's this weekend, definitely.  Anthony usually comes with his girl or whatever.  That's right.  I'll go.  I haven't seen you in a while.  I'll definitely be there this weekend.  We've got a couple new zingers.  I will absolutely go.  Eight o'clock show tonight, I might be able to pull that off.  Don't you have to go to sleep?  Well, usually it's like nine o'clock, ten o'clock sleep time.  Weekends are like a...  Tonight's an early show.  We've done before ten.  That's what I'm saying.  I think I can handle tonight's show.  Love to have you, pal.  By ten o'clock, I've been asleep for a couple hours already. 
[03:05:00]  That's a great endorsement.  The hosts of the show come to show their plug-in.  Jeffrey Ross telling a couple serious stories, but very funny guy.  He'll be at Caroline's all weekend long.  Starting tonight at eight o'clock.  For your tickets, call 212-757-4100.  Jeffrey, thank you.  Don't be a stranger, okay?  Who are you working with?  I'm sorry.  Two very funny guys, Jordan Rubin and Greer Barnes.  Oh, that's a great show.  And it's a hot one.  Nice.  That was Mazel Tov. 
[03:05:30]  Thank you.  Mazel Tov.  I love your new studio.  It's a very...  State of the art.  Isn't it nice?  Very homey.  There's not a lot of homeless derelicts hanging out in the lobby.  No, not yet.  We're going to take over this whole area outside, though.  These other guys don't know it yet.  Yeah, the cubicles and stuff are going to go, and we're going to put some...  We're going to put a lounge in there and a performance area.  We're going to have a little bar area.  Yeah.  Vans.  You've got to see the design for this place.  Right now, it looks like Mary Tyler Moore works here.  I know.  That's perfect.  It used to be Luke Grant's office.  That's perfect, yeah. 
[03:06:00]  But it's all going, man.  It's great to see you guys.  Definitely.  Jeffrey Ross, everyone.  I think it's two chimps on a Davenport and a face.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Here's Opie and Anthony when they're not awful.  Okay, terrific.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  No more of that.  It's bad for you.  Yeah, we went out to dinner with Super Agent Bob Eatman and his lovely bride.  Oh, yes.  She's beautiful.  Mm-hmm.  And Bob's, uh... 
[03:06:30]  Bob.  Bob has a great beard if you're starring in Philadelphia.  Yep.  What is it?  That little scrawny beard he's growing.  Bob walks in.  I've known Bob for, I don't know, he's been our agent for about six, seven years now.  And, uh...  Yeah, he walks into the restaurant with his beard.  So now you've got to acknowledge the beard because he's never had a beard before.  Uh-huh.  And it's like, oh, wow, Bob.  Uh, nice beard.  Yeah.  What do you say, you know?  Why did he grow a beard?  I have no idea.  Is he trying to intimidate people?  That's what I'm thinking.  Is it like the evil Bob? 
[03:07:00]  He grows a beard and wears a beret?  I know he has a lot of big meetings in New York in the next few days, so maybe he's trying  to intimidate.  Yes.  Maybe.  Maybe that's it.  Tough guy.  Put a little rubber band in it like a Lou Albano.  Yeah.  Hey, you.  Grab the guy by the lapels.  Hey, you.  I got a client.  So, I don't know.  And you blew off the dinner.  I completely blew off dinner.  I knew you would.  So, I'm like IMing Norton, begging him, come on, please go to dinner with me.  I don't want to do this by myself.  Please, please, please, please.  Here was my message from Bob's office last night. 
[03:07:30]  Hi, Anthony, Bob's office.  The dinner is going to be at, beep, message deleted.  How is that?  I didn't even care where it was going to be.  I got my email.  I saw the subject, restaurant, Bob coming in.  Boink, delete.  I didn't want to know.  I didn't care.  And I'm running out of excuses for you.  You know what the excuse was?  He never knows ahead of time, so then.  Yankee game.  Well, that's the one I used.  I didn't get any sleep.  He shows up, and he notices there's, like, an empty seat. 
[03:08:00]  Oh, where's Anthony?  Oh, you know, the Yankees are on.  I mean, it's just, you know.  That's it.  At this point, I think he knows that you just don't want to hang out with him.  After I sign.  In a social atmosphere.  After I sign the contract with XM Satellite Radio, that's it.  Why do we have to go out to dinner anymore?  He likes to have a little quality time with us.  Unless he's got something to tell me business-wise.  We didn't talk any business either.  We talked about all this stuff, but we did not talk about this.  No business?  That's not at all.  And Norton's waiting for me in the wrong restaurant, going, where the hell is he?  He's getting all mad. 
[03:08:30]  Where are you?  He's calling my cell phone.  I'm like, what do you mean, where are you?  I'm right at the bar.  He's like, so am I.  I'm like, no, you're not.  Turns out he's at the restaurant next door.  All these metrosexuals staring at me, and they knew I didn't belong, and they were correct.  It was embarrassing.  I had to slink out with my awful coat.  His winter coat.  You didn't dress up for your dinner with Bob?  I wore a decent shirt.  No, no, you got, you know what, somehow we got to tape this, because Norton is a completely  different person when he has to be.  What do you mean?  He's just really nice. 
[03:09:00]  He's like, he's clean shaven.  He has a nice shirt on.  He's very polite.  Yeah.  He eats a lot better.  And good table manners.  That's what I was trying to say, yes.  He has very good table manners.  I understand that, though.  Man, he's a totally understand that.  I've been in situations where you have to be the nice guy, and you're on alert, you're  on nice guy alert for the whole time you're there.  Like dinner with a girlfriend's family when you're growing up, and you're still in school  or something, and the girl invites you over, dinner with the family, and you're just completely 
[03:09:30]  aware of everything you're saying, everything you're doing.  You can't screw up.  And you've got that dopey smile on your face, like all is right with the world.  I'm happy to be here.  I'm a gentleman.  You don't have to worry.  I'm going to stick it up her ass.  You know, you've got to be a nice guy.  The grandmother makes a little joke, and you laugh politely.  Yeah, no, I know.  Maybe add something in that makes them laugh in such a clean fashion.  Yeah.  No, nothing blue.  That's right.  Like you said, Hitler was an underachiever. 
[03:10:00]  You know what I've been known to say at these dinners when you're trying to impress the  other family?  Oh, boy.  Chicken.  Chicken.  Oh, boy.  Now, Bill, you're on your diet, Bill.  Oh, boy.  Bill, put the chicken down.  Love that movie.  Yeah, yeah.  So we're having dinner, and Norton and I are looking at each other just laughing because  we're burying each other, basically.  Oh, really?  Yeah. 
[03:10:30]  At one point, Robin's, you know, Bob's wife there.  Robin.  That's right, Robin.  Robin is going to Norton.  I don't understand why you don't have a girlfriend.  You seem like a really nice guy.  So she does not listen to the show?  Oh, she listens to the show.  Oh, she's got problems with the show.  I don't like when you guys use the C word.  I just don't like that.  I'm learning way too much about you, Opie.  I thought you were a really nice guy.  I'm like, oh.  See?  See, this is what I hate.  It happens in my own family and stuff.  I don't want to talk about the radio show when we're not doing it with people like that. 
[03:11:00]  You know, we know the type of show we need to do to get our audience.  We don't need, like, Bob's wife, you know, critiquing us at dinner.  We just don't.  Like, if Bob's wife says the show is hysterical.  Then I know we're in deep trouble.  You're right.  But it's like, I just don't, I don't know.  I don't like that C word on the radio.  I'm like, well, whatever, man.  The show might not be for you.  Well, I know it's not for her, but I'm trying to be polite.  And it's like, and I want my kids, she's a mother of three, I want my kids to listen to you, you know.  And I just can't, and they're begging me to put the show on. 
[03:11:30]  It's like, what are you doing?  Shouldn't be children listening to this program.  Oh, and Bob heard all the crap we said about him.  Oh, he did?  I thought he was on a plane.  He's trying to play it off like, ho, ho, ho, ho.  It's just for the, I know it's just for the air.  He goes, why is my mic crapping out?  Is it the headphones?  It's your headphones, because I don't hear it crap out.  Clear as a bell, Ope.  So, yeah, Bob heard all that stuff, and he's playing it off like, ho, ho.  I've been in this business a long time.  I could take it.  I know what this is about.  But he said it like three or four times, which means he can't take it, and he's really bothered by it. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, no.  Because he knows we speak the truth when we say that, you know, that he wanted us to shut our mouths for the last two years so he could collect his 10%.  Because it comes down to money with everybody.  Who are you kidding?  So then Norton breaks out his digital camera, and she's like, oh.  Were there celebrities around?  Is that what happened?  No, we started talking about it.  I had a couple of good ones for the Trump roast with me.  I forget how we started talking about it.  Because she's like, well, Bob loves to do that.  No, no. 
[03:12:30]  So, like, get the pictures.  Maybe not how Norton likes to do it.  And so, can I see your pictures?  And all of a sudden, in a panic, Norton's like, oh.  And he's, like, quickly scanning, making sure there's nothing too crazy in there.  And this is Voss's cock.  So then he realized it was safe, and they're going over the pictures.  But then it comes to a picture of a girl, but it's a video clip.  Oh, a little video clip?  And Robin's like, why do you have a video clip of this girl?  And what did you say?  Because I don't want to mess that up.  It was a picture of a girl. 
[03:13:00]  And with the camera, what I had done was, I have, like, a little video option on my camera.  Yeah.  So I pretend I'm taking a picture, but I'm actually shooting video, an idea I got from somebody else.  But I'm actually saying, see, I'm trying to get a picture of you here.  You having a good time tonight?  Just to hear the girl going, oh, yeah, this is great, on video.  Oh, man.  Not sexual to get sex, but you never know if some kook is going to freak out and say that you did something bad.  How many video clips do you have on file on your computer? 
[03:13:30]  Dude, I should have been doing it all along.  I've only done it, like, once or twice.  It's probably with somebody who I don't know that well.  But this is what he does.  Yes.  You have to.  He gets evidence on his camera.  No, no.  You don't have to.  Can I get new headphones?  You have to.  If you're living a certain lifestyle, then you have to.  If you're living the Jim Norton lifestyle, then you are in a situation where you have to take video clips and get alibis.  You have to get people, like, to just confirm that they're having fun.  Because you don't know.  Someone might feel guilty.  I mean, let's be honest.  They're not going to look at me and go, well, I'm glad I fucked him. 
[03:14:00]  You know, I'm very realistic.  So they might wake up and go, ugh, what was I doing?  Right, right.  So she's advantage of me.  So she explains this to Bob's wife, and she goes, well, maybe you shouldn't be inviting women like this up to your apartment.  Oh.  And I'm sitting there like, God, she has no idea.  And I didn't want to blow up your spot.  Yeah, again, doesn't she listen to the show?  I didn't want to blow up your spot, and I'm dying to just let her in on everything.  Again, these are mostly hookers that come up here, and they're drug addicts, and one of them is going to freak out one time and say something to try to get some money, and I want some proof. 
[03:14:30]  Uh-huh.  But you couldn't say that to Bob's wife, so it was hilarious.  She's the nicest lady ever.  I know.  And then there's a picture of, like, puke in a sink or something.  No, that wasn't.  What was that?  I didn't get out of how we do little weird things for the listeners.  Because she was like, oh, my God, and she got all freaky and handed the camera back.  And I thought, because of what we were talking about yesterday, I thought it might have been a picture of a girl gagging.  Remember the puke bucket?  Oh, yeah.  I wasn't sure if it was the actual puke bucket.  It is, the puke bucket.  That was the puke bucket?  It wasn't puke.  What happened was this.  I was embarrassed.  When I was sick, like, last week, I was coughing up so much phlegm, and I was just spitting it. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, fuck it.  Dude, it was two or three days' worth of awful moogers.  Oh, man, stop it.  I'm going to...  I got a picture right here.  Yeah, show Anthony the picture.  It's not that bad, actually.  It's pretty bad.  But I was going to put it on the blog if I wrote about it or something.  I just wanted to have it, because you can't...  It smelled, too.  It had, like, that awful, sick breath smell.  God, stop it.  It's not that bad, Ant.  I'm telling you.  I got to drink water.  It's so funny that you get freaked out by this stuff.  It's not that bad.  It's not that bad.  It's fucking... 
[03:15:30]  Snot, to me, is a close second to shit.  No, it's not even snot.  It's only, like, say it's just a bucket full of stuff.  Oh, God.  It's a bucket full of all the spittle.  I mean, it's just like...  Don't be shy.  Why is everybody so shy?  Oh, Jesus, that's disgusting.  See, it's got a little bit of color on that one.  Hey, I just got an idea really fast.  What's that, Hope?  You know that the Red Sox, obviously, are in the World Series.  What are the odds of getting World Series tickets for this radio show?  They don't get comments. 
[03:16:00]  They just signed this massive deal with Major League Baseball.  Hey, that's right.  Someone get us a pair of freaking tickets to the World Series, because I want to bring  back the Boston Clam Chowder puke fest.  Oh, no.  Oh, that was a good one.  That was hilarious, though, man.  Yeah.  That was so freaking funny.  We have to break that out for World Series tickets.  Our first contest.  Why not?  I know.  That would be great.  We made people eat Boston Clam...  We need really good seats to the World Series.  We just have to do this.  It was the funniest freaking thing.  We did it for Super Bowl tickets last time around. 
[03:16:30]  It was one of the funniest shows we've ever done.  Oh, yeah.  Just because of the reaction of Anthony.  He can't take it.  And these guys just...  Everybody just puking.  One guy would puke, and then other guys involved in the contest started puking.  It really is nothing funnier than someone gearing up to puke.  And everyone watching was going, oh, oh, oh, oh, there he goes.  And then when it couldn't get any worse, you had guys eating the puke, which made other  guys puke.  It was just so out of control.  Oh, yeah.  For more tickets or whatever, they would need a piece of puke. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah, we've got to get World Series tickets and bring back the clam chowder bit.  Yeah.  You wouldn't watch a porn video like some of these Brazil scat movies where the girls  are like, you know, they're taking dumps on each other.  Oh, I watched those.  But they're vomiting on each other, too.  I watched that, too.  Yeah, but it really...  It's so disgusting.  You can't watch those alone.  It's got to be with a room full of friends and stuff because you kind of laugh.  Oh.  You know, because it's a goof.  Yeah, that's right, right.  Yeah, no, no.  Yeah, yeah, I forgot about that.  I thought I was like alone jacking off, but you're right.  It was with friends laughing.  But no, it's snot I can't take. 
[03:17:30]  Really?  I am so...  I cannot handle snot.  If there was a snot video, I wouldn't be able to watch it.  Someone told me about a mistress who blew her nose in his mouth, which I...  Oh!  Oh, man.  I read that.  He's like, oh, he went to a toilet.  That just got me.  She blew her nose.  She put his mouth on her nose and she blew her nose in his mouth.  That's bad.  That just got me.  Because even my own...  You know, you blow your nose and then you do the roll up the tissue thing and screw it  in there and then pull out a big rubber band. 
[03:18:00]  I just can't handle it.  I skeeve.  I can't look at it.  I got to throw it away really quick.  Vos will pull out boogers that should be hanging off a cave ceiling and this dirty, awful man,  he wraps him up.  He has cigarettes in his ashtray so he'll just like, he'll go, and he'll laugh and then  he'll just take the cigarette butt and like trape the booger around it.  It's like he's making a pig in a blanket out of a booger and a cigarette butt.  He's the worst person alive.  He wipes his boogers on the walls and stuff too. 
[03:18:30]  He's one of those guys.  He's awful.  He's an awful person from head to toe.  Anyway, so Robin, Bob's wife, was trying to get to know Norton a little bit.  Just can't understand why he doesn't have a girlfriend.  Yeah.  It was hilarious.  Well, I'm always polite around wives or girlfriends.  You have to be.  You gotta be.  Because if I had a girl with me who I like, I want a guy to be polite or respectful.  I hate guys that just don't know the rules.  I'm a pig with you guys.  That's true.  And then I made the mistake of telling Bob's wife that I'm having a problem with dumping. 
[03:19:00]  Why would you tell her this?  I don't know.  Because there was nothing else to talk about.  You've been at these dinners.  You start looking at the ceiling going, what can we talk about next?  I look at my watch and go, oh, okay.  If I leave now, I can be home by.  So she's like, tell me more.  I'm a mother of three.  I can help you.  Oh.  So I'm telling her, like, I can't crap.  She's giving you motherly advice on taking a dump.  So then Norton is just looking like, I can't wait to, you know, talk about this tomorrow on the air.  So I might as well say it first. 
[03:19:30]  And then she's asking me, well, what kind of food are you eating?  It might be too much fiber in your diet.  So I told her about the oatmeal.  And she's like, oh, it's the oatmeal.  And then she's like, I forgot what she told me to do.  Oh, she said to eat fruit.  Yeah.  Dried fruit.  Dried fruit.  And I tell you the joy that brought me when I realized that little faggoty snack he brings in was the source of his misery.  Like, he can't take a shit because of that oatmeal he brings in.  Yeah, you're backing yourself up.  It's like Elmer's glue and fiberglass you're putting in yourself.  So then we're just discussing bowel movements. 
[03:20:00]  You brought in more oatmeal today?  Yeah, he's hiding it over there.  Now you see it.  You know what's going to happen?  You're going to back yourself up some more.  You know, we have to.  I promised them we wouldn't talk about this, but we have to.  That looks like the inside of my bucket, by the way.  Your oatmeal.  Thank God I'm just about done.  We have to talk about what's going on in their relationship.  What?  We have to.  Did we promise them?  I didn't promise them.  I don't know.  Is it sexual?  It's hilarious. 
[03:20:30]  It's hilarious.  It's hilarious.  Is it sexual?  Well, I think they kind of gave us the okay at the end of dinner, right?  Sort of.  I'm trying to be cool.  Like it matters.  With this new gig, I'm trying to be cool.  Let it rip.  Because I actually want to have friends when I'm not on the radio.  Screw friends.  The old show, it got to the point no one wanted to hang out with me because they knew we'd  just talk about them the next day.  There's a guy that live in L.A. that really, really wants Bob's wife. 
[03:21:00]  And Bob knows it.  Bob's not stupid.  Bob's a man.  He understands.  But Bob's wife thinks that this guy is just being nice.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And Bob has to, like, tell her to stop emailing the guy.  Oh, boy.  This doesn't sound good.  Dude, this doesn't sound good.  No, I believe her.  It's like she is just, she's very nice.  She's very naive and very innocent.  I mean, she's a mother of three.  So she really doesn't really get what's going on. 
[03:21:30]  And, yeah, the guy pretty much has come on to her.  How is there an emailing relationship going on?  Bob wants it to stop.  Look, anyone that's out there right now.  Hello?  You listening to me?  Anyone that's out there.  If your girlfriend or wife emails guys on, like, a nightly basis,  they're sitting there chatting on AOL or emailing back and forth,  getting emails from guys, there's something going on there. 
[03:22:00]  No matter what they say, it's not some innocent little thing.  It's a relationship.  It is a relationship that can blossom, that can go further and further.  Thank God Bob doesn't spend much time traveling.  The guy's on the road all the time.  And Bob, you know, Bob wants to beat the crap out of the guy.  And if he was taller than 5'5", I think he would do it.  Because I think this guy's, like, over 6'2".  You know.  Is he handsome? 
[03:22:30]  Supposedly he's handsome.  Is he handsome?  Have they traded pictures?  No, no.  How do they spark up a relationship where they're emailing?  Their kids are in the same class.  Oh, God.  And the mom.  Common ground.  Great, great.  This is good.  And this guy ran into Robin's mom.  I guess Robin used to know the guy.  Just, you know, as an acquaintance back in the day.  Bob, Bob, end this quickly.  This has been going on for a while because I asked for the update,  and it was very uncomfortable when it brought it up at the table.  I'm like, so what's going on with it? 
[03:23:00]  I'm not going to say the guy's name.  Why can't you say his first name?  No, I don't want to, because I don't want to, just whatever.  Why, is he famous?  I don't know.  No.  So, yeah, so this guy asked for Robin's cell phone number and calls.  And then Robin takes a call, and, you know, I think in the beginning he openly just flirted with her.  And she's like, no, I'm not interested.  Thank you.  Anyway, I'm a mother of three.  I'm very happy with my husband.  I mean, she's playing it perfectly.  I mean, she's not interested, I swear to you, okay? 
[03:23:30]  Yeah.  But the guy will not give up on it and starts emailing her and calling her anyway.  And then Robin, trying to get out of this, set this creep, she calls him the creep, up with her friends.  And so he's going out with her friends but still not happy and it's not working out.  And then I guess Bob took his wife on a romantic getaway for their 10-year anniversary up to the Napa Valley.  Yeah.  And as they're driving, her cell phone rings. 
[03:24:00]  No.  Yeah.  Her cell phone rings.  And it's on the speakerphone in the car and it's this guy.  How did he get the cell phone number?  He's had it.  How?  Why?  From Robin's mom, I do believe.  What?  No.  This, no.  Well, we talked about that.  My mom gave my number out to my ex-psycho girlfriend.  Dude, here's the rule of thumb.  They just don't understand.  They're like, oh, you want to say how to Robin?  That's enough evidence right there.  Here's the rule of thumb you've got to go by, guys and girls.  If you know for sure that your mate isn't cheating on you, they might be cheating on you. 
[03:24:30]  Now, if you think that your mate is cheating on you, they are cheating on you.  That's how it works.  I could speak for Robin.  She's not cheating on Bob and has no intention to.  But I think, personally, I think she kind of likes the attention, a little bit of the  attention that's going on.  You know how these things, they grow out of control.  It's a virus.  It's like this show.  And that's what Bob's paranoid about. 
[03:25:00]  Right.  And he very well should be.  He's a little worried.  He's like, you know, he wants...  These things don't stay where they are static.  They blossom.  He wants his nip in the butt, as they say.  But, you know, they're running into him at all the school functions.  Of course.  You know, it's not like this guy's from another city or another town.  Oh, this is bad.  Poor Bob.  He's in the same community.  Oh, poor Bob.  This is bad.  I think Bob was okay with it.  And then he realized that his wife is really hot.  And he walked by a mirror and he's like, uh-oh.  I better do something here. 
[03:25:30]  Because I don't know how Bob pulled that off.  I think Bob, that's why Bob grew the beard.  Oh, do you think it's...  I think he's trying to look sexier.  Trying to be a little more hip.  I think he's trying to look sexier.  He saw some, like, Kirk Douglas movie from the mid-70s.  That's the look.  He's going to trade in the Vista Cruiser for a vet.  Try to be all hip.  Get an earring like Ed Bradley.  Oh.  It's the earring.  Get a tat.  Yeah.  He's got to get a tat.  It's just very interesting what's going on, though, with this whole thing.  Start working out.  Get all buff.  What kind of tattoo could he possibly get? 
[03:26:00]  A lawyer with a thumbs up?  But there's frustration...  A dollar sign.  Yeah.  There's frustration in Bob's voice because he knows what this is all about.  He has no doubt in his mind.  And she is like, no, he's just being nice.  No.  He's a little creepy, but he's just being nice.  No.  First of all, a guy in that situation, he's always looking to take it further.  Always looking for the score, which is to get laid.  That's the goal.  That's the goal.  He's not doing this to just be friendly and have this little platonic conversation thing on the Internet. 
[03:26:30]  It's not that way.  They look for the final goal is to get laid.  Yep.  And the women are maybe looking for a little companionship, some conversation, something  outside the humdrum of married life and raising kids.  It's a little bit exciting.  It's someone different.  And that can take off.  That can launch.  If the guy's smooth and starts talking, they got the rap.  Hey, look, I'm not talking about something that's never happened here. 
[03:27:00]  Stuff like this happens all the time.  He has to nip this in the bud.  Chris Rock has that great bit.  Oh, I know.  The platonic friendship.  The platonic friendship.  It's BS.  It's the dick behind the glass.  In case of emergency, break glass.  What you're saying basically is if this guy, right, has some type of a smooth guinea voice  and olive oil charm.  Nice.  I know what you're saying.  Now you'll get the hell out of here.  Hey, there was...  I ain't no agent.  I heard that story. 
[03:27:30]  Really fast?  His name is Bob Eatman, and he bores my father.  Really fast, the NYPD put in a request on the email.  Yeah.  You know, when you guys are doing the lines back and forth, and I get most of the movies.  They're like, could you just give us a list of movies where these are from so we can play  along at home?  Oh, right.  So just list them really fast.  I said it's Goodfellas.  A lot of them are Goodfellas.  Godfather.  Godfather 2 more than Godfather 1.  That was Godfather, both of them.  Clockwork Orange, The Shining.  Shining is huge. 
[03:28:00]  Cuckoo's Nest, I love tossing it.  Cuckoo's Nest, always appropriate.  Full metal jacket.  Always.  I'm trying to remember.  We said Goodfellas.  Casino.  Yeah.  Little Casino.  That's the majority of them.  Those are the ones.  I think that was the list they gave the guy.  We don't stray from our list very much.  Nah.  You don't really.  JFK.  Oh, God, yeah.  You haven't really done a lot of the JFK.  So what do you think with this situation?  It looks really bad.  I mean, really bad.  Bob is frustrated with this.  It's hilarious.  And if Bob is frustrated with it, that means it's gotten to the point where it's gotten 
[03:28:30]  further than it should have gotten.  And you know something?  You've got to nip it.  He's got to do something.  But yeah, he's in a rough situation because, first of all, he's not a tough guy.  He's a tough negotiator.  Maybe he can negotiate a deal with the guy.  You don't understand.  Ten percent of his wife.  Something like that.  I can see that up Bob figuring something like that out.  Well, Bob, you don't understand.  It's like you don't need violence.  I mean, you know, Bob with his pen could do more than 10,000 men with guns.  You know, I mean, Bob has a lot of power as an attorney. 
[03:29:00]  Just hire someone to kill the guy, Bob.  What's the matter with you?  Hire some guy to just smash his feet with a bat.  All right, let's see.  You know something?  He's got to tell his wife.  He has.  He's got to say, look.  I've seen him say it to her.  No, no.  I mean serious.  He's got to say, look, this stops.  This stops.  I'm going to get you a new cell phone.  You change the number.  And this guy gets this number again.  And, you know, there's going to be a big, big problem.  Big problem.  Hey, John. 
[03:29:30]  What's going on?  Hey, guys.  You got the same problem?  Yeah.  Well, you know what it is?  You know, I've been listening to you guys for a long time.  I'm originally from Long Island.  I used to live around the corner from Bob Buckman.  Hey, that's great.  The cue of the day.  Hey, that's great.  Well, yeah, it really sucks because, you know, I moved out to PA and I'm a truck driver  and I'm gone like every other day.  All right?  And my wife became friends with this guy and every time, man, you fuck up, it's like he's  here to comfort her. 
[03:30:00]  Right.  You know, and it blows.  And I tried everything.  And this guy, he calls the house once when I pick up the phone.  He hangs up the phone.  He's scared of me.  That's creepy.  And it is.  And, you know, I want to kick the living shit out of him.  All right?  And, you know, he runs scared for me.  And, you know, it's the same thing.  You know, so you don't dare fuck up because you know he's in the, just in the aisles waiting  for you.  What would your wife or what would someone's girlfriend do if all of a sudden every night  you're carrying on a conversation with a girl online and you're, you know, getting  this little relationship where she's calling you on the phone, you're talking, and then 
[03:30:30]  you tell the wife, oh, you're just friends.  You think any wife or girlfriend would stand by for that crap?  Of course not.  No.  No way in hell, man.  They're hanging out to dry, man.  The first thing they'll do is screw you over.  Oh, because you're just looking to get laid, but, you know, I'm just sitting here and I'm  in this relationship online, but it's not going to go any further than that, but stop  it.  Oh, yeah.  It's always progressing, moving forward up to the point where the guy wants to take  it, which is sinking it deep in your loved one. 
[03:31:00]  And let me tell you something.  Women are more capable of being friends because a lot, especially when they're married with  kids, because a lot of times they don't get out of the house that much.  They're kind of bored.  So they have fun online, chitting and chatting.  A little chit chat.  I've talked to a lot of married women, and to be honest with you, most of them, 80 to  90 percent of them just want to be friendly, and they don't want to take it anywhere.  Once in a while, you'll get lucky and pick one off, but normally they just want to be  friendly, and I'm the dirtbag at home with my pants, you know, and I'm whacking my bag  trying to get something dirty started. 
[03:31:30]  I see what you mean, but you know something?  It only takes one guy to break through that barrier, be a little smooth, and it's over.  I'm crass and obvious.  Yeah.  You are crass and obvious.  I try to put LOL at the end of it, but it doesn't, you know.  So you want to take a dump on my chest?  LOL.  You know, just kidding, having fun.  R-O-F-L-O.  R-O-A-F.  Rolling all over the floor.  I only want to hear that if you're a burn victim.  All right.  Thank you, John.  Let's go to Lobster.  Another trucker checking in today.  Hey, Lobster. 
[03:32:00]  What's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Here, I'll give you the horn.  There you go.  Listen.  Your horn's a little weak.  Yeah.  Oh, hey, look.  What can I say?  I'll open a window a little better for you here.  All right.  That's a loud one.  Listen, I was living in New York City at the time, and I got on a chat room, and I met this  chick down in Delaware.  Her husband was a trucker, and he was gone.  I worked local, and he was gone, you know, out all the time, and she started confiding 
[03:32:30]  in me.  Four kids, the whole nine yards, married ten years.  Glammin' body.  Thirty-eight double D's, thirty-two, thirty-six, unbelievable.  Five foot eight, dark brown hair, dull eyes, beautiful.  She runs the show for her husband.  I mean, she totally dominates this guy.  Well, she's complaining about him.  Well, let me tell you, this chick is into everything, totally freaky.  I mean, I've introduced her to fisting, domination. 
[03:33:00]  Fisting?  How do you introduce someone to fisting?  Yeah.  How do you introduce someone to fisting?  Yeah.  What do you do?  Put on Caligula and go, wait, you know?  Pull out the lard.  My God.  She is just, she is a kinky dream come true.  She's totally into being dominated.  Tie her up.  She has to be tied up when I fist her.  She just loves it because she thrashes.  Well, they all do, yes.  Oh, she thrashes around.  I've even done double anal fisting with her.  I mean, just totally over the top. 
[03:33:30]  Shake hands with yourself.  Wait a minute.  Hey, pleased to meet you.  Wait, double anal fisting?  I swear to God, two fists in the anal cavity.  Two in the, and then you know what you do?  You try to clap.  Hey.  And then you say, hey, I can't clap.  And she goes, tight, huh?  Oh, I tell you.  Hey, I had a refurbisher.  I put in a 20-pound ham and pulled out the bone.  Lovely.  Bump, bump.  Oh, it's just unbelievable.  So, listen, guys.  Yeah. 
[03:34:00]  I'm warning you, man.  If you're in that kind of relationship, that shit is happening.  All right.  And listen, I work down in Florida right now.  I drive a cement bulk hauler.  I got wow written on all the mudflash.  Oh, thank you.  I go through Gainesville, Florida.  I run dedicated route between Tampa and Gainesville.  And that's the college town, Florida Gators.  I have had a couple of those wonderful, lovely, perky college flashes. 
[03:34:30]  Very nice.  The girls are definitely out there ready to flash you if you have wow in your car.  I'm telling you, it works like a charm.  Don't the truckers tend to be chatty Cathy's?  What else they got?  They're lonely out there.  I understand.  All right, Lobster.  Thank you.  Bye, fellas.  Hey, have a good one, guys.  I can't believe he put both claws in her little backside.  Double anal fisting.  Little rubber bands around his hand.  Oh, little Lobster.  Little rubber band. 
[03:35:00]  I didn't know that was possible.  Oh, yeah, it is.  That hurts.  This thing to me is disgusting and violent.  That would hurt.  Oh, we found your limit, huh?  Does nothing.  I don't like anything inserted into a woman.  I'm a pervert, but it's got to be organic.  I don't like dildos and toys.  Beat it with that crap.  No?  No.  Put this in.  For what?  What is that doing for me?  Exactly.  Yeah, it's part of your self-centeredness.  You think it would just have to be you in there.  But no, I mean, no, not at all.  I know I'm kind of inept, but it's not about just using the vagina as an object holder. 
[03:35:30]  It's not a pencil holder.  I'd rather lick it.  I mean, it's not about me.  I'm in there.  I believe I'm a good egg, but I don't like putting stuff in there in a fist.  It's so weird where his lines are, but it really is.  Okay, let's say hi to Dale, another trucker.  A lot of truckers checking into this.  Of course.  Very early.  Hey.  Hey, how are you doing?  Pretty good, man.  You had the same issue as our agent?  Oh, shit, yeah.  I mean, when I woke up, I just woke up with your radio station, and I'm sitting there, 
[03:36:00]  and the next thing I hear is a story, and I had a flashback.  This shit happened to me exactly.  Really?  Let me tell you something.  If he thinks it's going on, it's going on.  I was married for four months, and my ex, man, she was doing a phone deal and everything.  We went out to New York City.  We're from Indiana.  We went out to New York City for Christmas last year.  All the way out there and all the way back.  Her cell phone was ringing, and guess what? 
[03:36:30]  It was old Bob.  That's who it was.  Huh.  I don't think, but I'm going to disagree with one thing.  Just because you think she's doing it, she's doing it.  Not necessarily true, because his wife is not cheating on him.  I don't think she's cheating on him at all.  I have to say that, because we probably shouldn't even have brought this story up.  I just know that it's just a flirtatious thing that's driving Bob nuts, and they're trying  to figure out how to make this guy go away.  Close enough, and there's no upside to it. 
[03:37:00]  It can't end good.  But she's asked him to don't email me anymore.  Like, please don't email me anymore.  I'm uncomfortable with your compliments.  You know something?  If she did that, then fine.  Let him email.  Delete, delete, delete.  Never answer again.  Change your phone number.  Don't answer the cell phone.  Change your phone.  I don't understand.  Hey, mine said the same thing.  She said that, well, I asked them to quit doing this, and I asked them to quit doing  that, and then, you know, something just happened.  Oh, I asked them.  You know, whatever. 
[03:37:30]  And where did this guy come from?  How did she meet him?  How did mine meet him?  Yeah, how did you?  He was the manager in the store where she used to work at.  Oh, there you go.  At the Walmart?  No, at a truck stop.  So that's on my tab.  Oh, boy.  So what happened, the only thing that's suspicious, though, is like every time the guy would call  the house, she would say to Bob, Bob, could you leave?  Oh.  And she would ask him to go to the other room so she could talk.  But that's not bad.  No.  Let's calm down now. 
[03:38:00]  Eric from Nebraska, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, man.  When my wife and I have been married eight years, and she caught me on AOL right after  we got married, chatting with some woman, and she turned around and started doing the  same damn thing with some guy.  Well, it was your fault.  You started it.  Good for the goose is good for the gander.  Oh, yeah.  But she caught me red-handed doing it.  She tried being sneaky with me, and I installed spyware software where I could keep an eye on  what she was doing. 
[03:38:30]  Yep.  And so I caught her, and the conversation started getting real racy, like, you know,  the guy wanted to meet her, and my wife was real sweet and innocent and all this shit,  and a friend of mine told me one day, he said, yeah, there was some strange guy over at your  house, or over at your apartment, when one of my buddies lived a couple houses down, or  a couple doors down from us.  He goes, yeah, there was some guy over there the other day.  That's all.  I don't know who the fuck he was.  So I turned around and set up two hidden video cameras in our apartment.  I don't know if I still have the tape, and I told your screener, I'll look and see if 
[03:39:00]  I still do.  But, man, my sweet and innocent wife, he told me she'd never cheat on me.  You got video of her?  What was she doing in the video?  Oh, just about anything that she wouldn't do with me.  That's for damn sure.  Here he is.  Here's the guy watching this video.  Yeah, I just, you know.  Turn it off!  Turn it off! 
[03:39:30]  Turn it off!  Oh, oh, no, okay.  No, that was a tape of me last night watching the Yankee game.  Oh, okay.  Sorry, sorry.  I got confused.  Thank you, Eric.  Yeah.  All right.  You know, I hate that online thing.  I was online, I was trying to pick up what I thought was a cop once.  Turned out to be a 13-year-old girl when I went to meet her.  Isn't that horrible?  I hate when that happens.  So deceiving. 
[03:40:00]  Alabama trucker, check it in.  It's Colt 4-5.  What's up, buddy?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  I'm cruising through this fuckhole state of Alabama.  I love these truckers, man.  Oh, shit.  Hang in there.  So what do you got today?  It's all foggy and shitty out.  It's Alabama.  Yeah.  That's a sunny day in Alabama.  Yeah.  Are you kidding?  Yeah.  All right.  What do you got, bro?  Those truck drivers who called in earlier, fucking another truck driver's wife while he's 
[03:40:30]  out.  Yeah.  They're called Jody's, man.  Jody's?  Yeah.  That's what we call them out here is a Jody.  A Jody.  This guy, this guy, as soon as you leave the house, he's over pumping cock and your wife  is as hard as he can do it.  Wow.  Fucking slime bag.  You know what?  You know what?  I'm starting to think that there's not many truckers out there in a happy relationship. 
[03:41:00]  I know.  There's all sorts of crap going on when they're on the road.  They're getting hemorrhoids from bouncing all over the highway and their awful wives are  giving a box to some creep in the neighborhood.  Don't blame them.  All right.  There's a couple more.  The phones have exploded.  We wanted to move on to a couple things here, but Ryan in Chicago.  Hey.  Hey.  How's it going, guys?  Pretty good, bro.  Kind of had the same thing happen to me a year ago.  My wife kicked me out.  I'm a trucker.  And I moved in with my best friend.  He kept going down there telling me he's just being friends with her. 
[03:41:30]  Found out he's fucking her in my house while I was sleeping on his couch in his apartment.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, Jesus.  That's low.  Oh, now the two of them are living together.  But the best thing is I got the house and everything out of the whole deal.  Did you beat him up, though?  Come close a few times.  Every time I go near their house, they call the cops on me for something stupid.  Yeah, because it's your problem.  Yeah, I've got the problem.  And he's the low life that snuck in and banged my old lady in my bed.  Well, what did you think, though?  Like, when you were on his couch, what did he say?  I'll go talk to her and I'll be back? 
[03:42:00]  Like, how would it happen that he would just wind up there and tell you about it?  No, he'd tell me he was going to somewhere else to see some other girl.  I went down to my house one day and he's sitting in my kitchen cooking dinner for my wife and kids.  I drug him out of the house and the low life bastard wouldn't raise his hands.  I threw him all over the yard and he wouldn't do nothing.  Just one man tossing another man around the yard.  I like that.  Smell your wife on his penis.  He didn't want to punch you because he didn't want his hands to swell because he wanted to fist your wife. 
[03:42:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Probably.  That's okay.  He can have the fat skank whore anyway.  Hey, there you go.  That's right.  Move on to another one, sir.  Thank God you went with that with me, sir.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  That was awkward for all of us.  I wasn't that brave to go with that, but thank you for helping me out.  Guys, opening his heart up and you're doing a fisting reference.  I know.  He didn't want swollen fists.  All right, two more and we'll move on.  Okay, another trucker in PA.  It's Steve.  Hey, Steve. 
[03:43:00]  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Let me hear the horn quick.  There you go.  All right.  Yeah.  I fucked my ex-old lady more now than I did when I was married.  Really?  That's an odd thing, man.  That is an odd thing when I hear this.  She just got remarried back in July.  That's the best part.  She's remarried and you're still banging her?  Oh, yeah.  The new husband works middle shift, so he ain't never home at night.  Every time I bring my son home, she puts him in bed and we just go to town.  Wow. 
[03:43:30]  See, they're all pigs.  People are all just disgusting.  It's everybody.  Everyone just wants to get laid.  We all make believe we don't want to.  Yes, mister.  Oh, you got it.  Bravo.  He nailed you.  You ate it.  It's like you were his ex-wife.  The way he just banged you.  You have to be tired today.  I am tired.  God damn it.  Wow.  That rarely happens right there.  He got me good.  Oof.  Oh, boy.  I poked my fat face right out. 
[03:44:00]  Can I help you?  Hello?  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Wait.  He's still there?  Hello?  Richie.  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I was at a wedding.  My wife has a lot of clients, and there was this one lawyer guy who kept calling all the  time, email and everything.  So we're all sitting at the wedding table, and we're getting a little drunk.  He says, you know, I never want you to think that there's anything going on with my wife.  So, you know, everything's quiet because people are talking and shit.  And I said, if anything was ever going on with my wife, I just beat the fucking balls 
[03:44:30]  off of you.  The whole wedding goes dead quiet.  Fucking very uncomfortable situation.  Was anything going on?  I never heard from the guy again.  What was going on with this guy, though?  Hey, I think he was trying to strike up something with my wife, but then once I confronted him,  he just disappeared.  You're not a lawyer, right?  No, no, no.  I'm a construction worker.  Yeah, definitely.  That's Trump's lawyer, definitely, when it comes to the fisticuffs.  That's it for the worst of Opie and Anthony.
