<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of the previous weekend's NFL games, focusing on the New York Jets' poor performance and the surprising victories of the Buffalo Bills and Seattle Seahawks.  Fantasy football was also briefly touched upon, specifically the absence of Tim Tebow from anyone's team. The hosts then debated Eli Manning's near-record-breaking passing yards in the New York Giants game.  The conversation quickly shifted to the controversy surrounding the amateur film "Innocence of Muslims," the ensuing riots, and the hosts' incredulity at the low production quality of the film sparking such violence.

Next, they recounted a recent visit to the American Museum of Natural History, discussing exhibits like the T-Rex display and comparing the museum's donation policy unfavorably to their experiences with Time Warner Cable and AT&T customer service. This led to a discussion of stand-up comedians, including Bill Burr, and an anecdote about a party with Questlove and John Mayer, all while continuing to vent their frustrations with their respective cell phone providers.

A caller then shared his own infuriating experience with AT&T's automated system shutting off his phone due to an unpaid bill, despite his claim of payment. The caller’s excessive data usage from using his phone as a hotspot for streaming TV was also discussed, along with his comedy gigs in West Nyack.  The conversation then veered to a local car accident, followed by an extended, highly critical discussion of the Kardashians and their reality show, expressing confusion over its popularity.  The hosts then launched into explicit commentary regarding leaked topless photos of Kate Middleton, speculating about the legal ramifications and the personalities of Prince William and Prince Harry.  This was followed by discussion of Richie Sambora’s upcoming appearance, his past relationship with Denise Richards (including explicit comments about "Wild Things"), and speculation about the British line of succession.  The segment concluded with harsh criticism of Occupy Wall Street on its one-year anniversary, referring to the protesters as spoiled and privileged.

The show continued with more derisive commentary about the protest movement, calling the participants "a bunch of fucking douchebags."  The conversation moved to E-Rock's weekend, his video game playing, and a discussion of sports team loyalty (Mets vs. Yankees), punctuated by highly offensive language ("faggotty," "cocksuckers").  This led to a shockingly inappropriate and sexually suggestive recounting of one host's childhood memories involving a child, described with graphic language.  The hosts then reminisced about past guests, specifically "retarded Laverne and Shirley," detailing offensive and inappropriate encounters with celebrities at the MTV Music Awards, using derogatory terms and describing offensive behavior.

Richie Sambora then joined the show.  The interview covered his new album, his relationship with his 15-year-old daughter, touring with Bon Jovi for over 30 years, the band's internal conflicts and financial history, his approach to parenting, and the challenges of navigating his daughter's burgeoning sexuality.  Profanity and casual discussions of drug and alcohol use were prevalent throughout the interview.

The next segment included a continuation of the Sambora interview, focusing on Bon Jovi's image changes, early negative reviews of *Slippery When Wet*, his solo career, vocal maintenance (including steroid shots), international touring experiences (including encounters with protesters in Athens and security restrictions in Mexico City), his relationship with his daughter, his new album *Aftermath of the Lowdown*, his musical influences, and his musical learning process.  The conversation also touched upon his Jersey roots and relationship with Bruce Springsteen; his attempt to collaborate with Jimmy Page; the changing landscape of rock music; their negative opinions of Mayor Michael Bloomberg's policies (specifically the large sugary drink ban); and concluded with further explicit comments about Sambora's daughter's attractiveness.  A listener's negative comment about Bon Jovi was also briefly addressed.

The final segment discussed the high cost of living in New York City, specifically commuting costs, contrasting it with taxes on sugary drinks.  The hosts then discussed their upcoming stand-up comedy shows, their frustrations with low attendance in certain cities, and the potential for cancelling poorly selling shows. They played a clip from Louis C.K.'s show featuring a brutally honest monologue about the realities of a comedian's career in their 40s, highlighting the potential for failure and the often cynical nature of the entertainment industry, concluding with further commentary on the disingenuous nature of fans and industry professionals.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Oh, yeah, people, ha, ha, noises, ha, ha, noises, ha, ha, noises, ha, ha, ha, stupid  jets, what happened, Steeler Nation beat the shit out of me on Twitter yesterday. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, they beat the shit out of me.  I guess that was it, huh, the first game for the Jets, they fucking pummeled Buffalo, and  then what happened?  Oh, Buffalo fucking pummeled in their home opener, so they look kind of good, so, I don't  know, fucking Sanchez looked like shit after the first drive.  Sanchez.  Then I made fun of their stupid, terrible towels, and I got a beating on Twitter.  I deserve it.  Sometimes you just got to admit, ah, I deserve it. 
[00:01:00]  What am I going to do?  I hate those stadium props, though, like that.  Well, I was just watching the game, and they're all, like, waving their terrible towels, and  then, I didn't do it justice, I understand, but I started laughing at myself, because I'm  thinking, like, if you're a hardcore Steelers fan, you really want to take care of your terrible  towel, so I said, I couldn't word it right, I'll be honest, but I was thinking that these  guys go home with their terrible towel, and they carefully put it in their washing machine  by itself on the delicate cycle to take care of their terrible towels. 
[00:01:30]  Using some downy in there.  People were a little confused by a tweet, but it made me laugh inside.  Terrible towel.  They had dumb terrible towels, and then everyone had to say, I haven't washed my terrible towel  since Terry Bradshaw was the cornerback, Jesus.  I'm like, whoa, okay, sorry.  That is a terrible towel.  Fucking Jets.  Fucking Tebow.  Fucking Sanchez.  It's football season.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:02:00]  How did your fantasy football do this weekend?  Oh, man.  I know you're secretly playing.  I had, well, I have no idea.  No one has Tebow on their team, it's hilarious.  No one has him on their fantasy football team.  I don't know one person that plays fantasy football that has Tebow on their team.  I have him on my fantasy religion team.  He could be the worst player for fantasy football ever.  Yeah.  Ever.  He's not even going to get you any stats.  He barely plays.  And then.  Hey, man, he had one good play yesterday.  What, did he have one carry for like 12 yards? 
[00:02:30]  Hey, you were watching.  I heard.  I think it was a little further than that.  The other 20-something.  I think it might have been in the 20s.  In the 20s.  Yeah.  But the fucking Jets were never really in it after that first impressive drive.  J-E-T-S.  Jets, Jets, Jets.  J-E-T-S.  Jets, Jets, Jets.  Jimmy's Cowboys also lost.  Oh.  I found out this morning.  It shows you how much interest I have.  Who'd they lose to?  I didn't even see the score.  They lost to. 
[00:03:00]  To the Seahawks.  That's right.  Yeah.  Very good.  Oh, that's good.  Sleepless in Seattle.  Right.  It was a terrible game.  I actually saw that somewhere online.  Sleepless in Seattle.  I think Seattle's over the whole sleepless in Seattle thing.  Are they?  You don't have to reference that for everything.  They probably hate that.  Yeah.  But someone actually wrote that as far as the Cowboys go.  And also.  They were sleepless in Seattle. 
[00:03:30]  Tom Brady and the Pats losing their homo.  Was it their homo?  Yeah.  They lost to the Arizona Cardinals.  That's a team.  Yeah.  They had a chance to win it with a little field goal.  And whoopsie.  They whoopsied it.  They whoopsied it.  Damn.  Yep.  And the stupid Giants.  The stupid Giants.  Well, now they won.  Yeah, but I guess they came back. 
[00:04:00]  But if you're a Jets fan, you're not a Giants fan.  If you're a Giants fan, you're not a Jets fan.  I don't want to hear it.  I don't want to hear it from the people like, no, when the Jets start sucking, then I become  a Giants fan.  But they play in the same stadium.  Sorry.  No, not me.  Eli Manning threw for 500 and what was it?  Tied the record.  Was it 510?  He didn't tie the record.  That's what I heard.  Three yards short.  Phil Simms still has it.  Who said he tied the record to me?  I think someone fucking gave me wrong info.  Someone's giving me erroneous information. 
[00:04:30]  Well, let's find out because I heard he was three yards short of the record.  I think he was second for the team and I think seventh NFL of all time, I think.  Wow, Davey, very good.  I have to check my sources out.  Maybe he's tied for second with the team and that's what I got.  I don't know.  Phil Simms still has it by three yards.  Phil Simms still has it by three yards.  I think my info could be wrong.  That Tom Coughlin, man.  Holy fuck.  He's a scary dude.  He will fucking punch in the face for dumb shit. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah?  One of those guys?  Oh yeah, you can tell.  You don't want to get on his bad side.  Yeah, three yards shy of Sims.  Of Sims.  As per Travi.  Five hundred and ten yards throwing.  What the fuck?  That's a lot of fucking throwing.  Well, he didn't look that good in the first half.  That's what's weird about that.  A lot of turnovers, right?  Wasn't he plagued by some turnovers early on?  Good, good, good, good.  I'm trying.  Were you red zoning?  A little bit.  Yeah? 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just...  I'm not really interested in watching football that much, believe it or not, kids.  But there's just something about that red zone.  They're like...  You feel compelled.  My, uh...  The in-laws were up for the weekend.  And my father-in-law, he's a big fantasy football guy.  Just a big sports guy.  Oh yeah.  He's all excited.  He's got his beer.  He's like, alright, here we go.  Ready to rock.  And I turn on the TV, and instead of the red zone, he gets one lousy game.  He gets the Giants game.  Oh, because you got that Time Warner cable, don't you? 
[00:06:00]  Guess who left my house early?  Oh.  He's hoping he can get home in time for the 4 o'clock games.  He's sitting there with the beer, all ready to go.  All ready to just manically watch the football games.  He's obviously from Philly.  Most people know that by now.  But he's actually a Dolphins fan, because he grew up in Connecticut.  Yeah.  But he does like taking a little peek at the Eagles as well.  Know how bad it is when you go to another city on a Sunday, and you're excited to see your team, 
[00:06:30]  and then you have to watch a who-gives-a-fuck team?  You don't care.  You have to see the Giants-Panthers.  Why won't they get red zone on Time Warner?  I don't know.  Time Warner.  He stinks.  I know it's been a good bit for a while, but I'm going Fios, finally.  You got him.  No, I'm finally going Fios.  I have a Time Warner issue.  Yeah.  In my apartment here in Manhattan.  Initially, you recall when I first got this place, I have Time Warner cable.  I got no choice in the matter.  And you get the, all the digitizing and shit. 
[00:07:00]  And then finally, I turned my TV on a while back, and I get no sound out of my television.  I get it when I use the Xbox or anything else, but the cable box decides no sound.  And I've tried all the unplug it and everything.  And then I try calling them, and it was such a, it was an exercise in futility and anger.  So I just hung up and figured, fuck it, I'm just going to slingbox everything from my house on Fios. 
[00:07:30]  Right.  So I've been doing that.  Nice.  Well, last week...  Oh, what did they do?  The internet just stopped working.  And I tried everything with the router, all that same shit.  Did you reboot it?  Did you reboot the box?  Did you unplug?  I unplugged it and left it like that when I went out.  Yeah.  And then I come back and plug in it and nothing.  So now, I can't even slingbox Fios from my house unless what I did, I used my fucking phone as a hotspot to watch television.  And now I'm already up to my quota on my monthly data. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, the data usage?  Yes.  My phone's been...  So Time Warner just fucking, it sucks!  Terrible company.  It's horrible!  My phone has been panicking me with that data usage thing.  What's going on?  You get scared.  What happened?  You get that text and it's like, by the way, you've used 50% of your data.  But what has changed?  Oh, shit.  What has changed is you're using so much data these days.  You think?  And there's no more unlimited data.  But they go, if you...  The tip is, you gotta find a Wi-Fi connection. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, alright.  Yeah, no shit.  Well, I can't in my apartment where I'm paying for fucking Time Warner cable.  So what, you got a bad...  I have a bad router.  I have a bad cable box.  I have a bad fucking cable provider.  And I'm gonna call up Time Warner and have to fucking deal with this shit.  Anybody out there, by the way, if you're involved with Time Warner, you can either call me to help me or shoot yourself.  Please.  Either one?  Either one will work.  Either one, and I'm happy.  Fucking assholes.  Hate that fucking company.  Hate it. 
[00:09:00]  Maybe you can get Dish.  Dish!  Ah, I did.  Well, you know.  There's no reads today.  You don't have to kiss their ass.  Oh, good.  Well, I don't even know what.  Sorry, I want to watch fucking some entertaining programs.  I just read that shit.  I don't even know what Dish is.  Yeah, Walking Dead's coming up.  Yeah, Walking Dead's coming on and Dish doesn't have it because they're fucking brawling.  Dish doesn't have...  AMC.  AMC.  The customer gets screwed every fucking time.  Every time.  Every time.  It's amazing.  I want to congratulate the NHL for locking out their players and seeing not one article on it where anyone gives a fuck. 
[00:09:30]  No one cares about hockey.  Especially right now.  The playoffs are coming up for baseball.  Look, I'll go Gary Bettman's an asshole.  Others would argue this point, but we can all agree he's a fucking asshole to begin with.  Secondly, no one gives a fuck.  It's the worst time to lock out your players when football season is just beginning, so everyone's excited.  Their teams are all in still.  Baseball is kind of getting exciting because of the playoffs.  You can start the playoffs and shit. 
[00:10:00]  And these assholes decide it's a perfect time to lock out their players.  And then in the end, when they do figure something out, you know, the fucking fans will get screwed again.  That's how that works out.  Didn't they just do this?  It seems like it, doesn't it?  This is the second time in ten years, maybe less.  How do they think they're going to compete with football and basketball and baseball?  I don't know, man.  They just keep fucking with the seasons.  But I don't, I mean, I'm a hockey fan.  I don't give a fuck.  I don't give a fuck.  No.  I just don't give a fuck.  Go and just fucking, and the players will just move on to other leagues. 
[00:10:30]  They'll play this year.  They don't give a fuck.  They'll go over to, you know, the Soviet Union there.  Right.  And I, I don't even know, I don't even know what the, the, the issue is.  I don't know who's right or who's wrong.  I don't care.  I just know that, uh, once again, hockey is shooting themselves in the balls.  They're just stupid.  Sorry.  What?  I'm watching the Soyuz capsule lands in Kaz, uh, Kazakhstan.  Yeah.  And, and, and it's just this big hunk of burnt metal that fucking pretty much crashes in 
[00:11:00]  the middle of their, uh, Russian desert over there, whatever, their former Soviet bloc country  desert.  And there's our American fucking astronaut having to pop out of that piece of shit because  we don't have a fucking space program pretty much.  Oh, it's just embarrassing.  The whole world's going to shit.  It really is.  We just fucked it up.  What a fucking great thing this was.  And we can't figure it out.  Can't figure shit out these days.  That fucking whole, that movie, that movie, innocence of Muslims, uh, the innocence of 
[00:11:30]  Islam and Muslims, it's hilarious.  It's just a piece of shit that if anybody thinks that they're taking that to the point  where they're, I'm sure there are people taking it and they're, you know, killing Americans  to burning down fucking, uh, uh, embassies.  But, but to say that that's the only reason they're doing this is, is insane.  You're insane.  They just needed a catalyst.  To see Carney get out there and, and start speaking to the people and say, it's the video. 
[00:12:00]  In essence, what he's doing is saying these people are fucking retards.  If they're that angry at that movie and that's all you're saying is it's because of the video,  you're also saying that these fucking Muslims are retarded.  And also the actors or actresses are saying that he, you can hear he, I watched it, he  dubbed.  They didn't know what they were doing.  No.  The girl said she thought it was like the guy's name was George.  She didn't know it was Mohammed.  Yeah.  And then they, they dubbed it in at the end.  It's a screen screen. 
[00:12:30]  Nah.  The director's kind of a, or the producer's kind of a scumbag.  Have you seen where Mohammed went?  It's all badly dubbed.  We were, we were discussing this over the weekend.  And there's no doubt.  And I was telling Ant before the show, this is how the end will, uh, the world will end  with the Muslims.  Well, there's two societies that will absolutely never get along.  Yeah.  Uh, the stupid Joe, Joe Scarborough made a good point at the top of his show today, basically  saying every single president comes in and thinks they're going to be the ones that figures  out some kind of fucking formula that makes it all work for everybody. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Some kind of solution.  The fact is there are two drastically different cultures and we're never going to get along.  And eventually it will be the end of the world.  It will be the end of the world.  As they get stronger and stronger with, uh, you know, with their weapon, weapon tree.  Yep.  It will be the end of the world.  I, when I initially watched this, uh, this, uh, clip or movie or trail, whatever the fuck  it's supposed to be, I honestly didn't think I clicked on the right one. 
[00:13:30]  Cause it was so silly.  I clicked on a goof of it.  Like the beards are all fake.  They got these big fake Muslim beards and it's, it's done so.  Badly.  And they're trying to make jokes.  And then the green screening that they're doing when they're sitting in the desert, they're  hovering like three inches above the ground because they couldn't figure out how to put  in any shadows or anything.  I swear.  I'm looking at a clip with you guys right now.  I thought this was like a, I thought this was like a, it's such a goof. 
[00:14:00]  It looks like it's a, just a silly parody.  Although I think it's an Al Qaeda attack that was kind of, that's the excuse that's being  used, but it seems like it was a coordinated attack.  It wasn't, there were some people that just jumped on because of the video.  Yeah.  It's like, it's hard, it is hard to believe that, that people can be this stupid to be  offended by this hunk of garbage movie.  You don't get a few hundred people showing up with RPGs, grenades and automatic weapons  on a whim like that at the embassy.  Look at, look at this. 
[00:14:30]  He's green screened to the, to a desert in the background and he's got like a fake beard.  Look at his big fake beard.  It's a goof.  And then his skin tone was a shoe polish.  Shoe polish.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It looks like shoe polish.  But you can hear the names that are, that are dubbed in.  And even if it was meant to be, it was obviously meant to be offensive, but even if it was  meant to be serious, why, why, why does, why is the answer rioting?  I mean, like, this is terrible.  They're above the desert. 
[00:15:00]  I guess the worst.  There's no shadow, no footprints, no nothing.  It's a still picture of like Palm Springs.  But let's be honest, some of the shit that Hollywood puts out, don't you want to riot?  True.  Yes.  Don't you want to riot over some of that crap?  Caddyshack 2.  Caddyshack 2 is a good example.  I almost killed people over that.  Yeah, they're saying they didn't know.  And the girl is saying that the guy's name was, she's in the paper today, she's saying  his name was George in the script.  George.  And first of all, what a terrible actress to have agreed to do this awful movie. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, it's horrible.  What's sad is no one's going to listen to her explanation.  That's going to fall on deaf ears.  All these actors are putting out these fucking statements and they're, they're horrified  that they think they're going to get their fucking throats slit.  Of course.  Yeah.  It's the fear of making fun of Islam.  She's, she's like taunting him to eat her pussy.  And I don't know if that's supposed to be Muhammad.  I don't know which character that is.  It is.  That's supposed to be Muhammad.  Oh, is that him?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow. 
[00:16:00]  And, uh, they talk about, you know, pedophilia and fucking, uh, killing people and gay stuff.  Gay stuff.  Yeah.  A lot of the gay.  It's literally just obviously really meant to be inflammatory and just meant to be,  it's, it's, if you're a Muslim and you watch this, it's offensive.  It's like, you know, if they just did this about Christ and they had them cruising guys  and blowing people, it would be, people would be offended by that.  People would be offended.  We would just, uh, handle it a little differently than they are right now.  Right.  The last temptation of Christ was seen is very offensive.  Yeah.  Well, I'm default.  Yep.  Yeah.  And, uh, the riots. 
[00:16:30]  It's, I don't know, I don't know what you do, but I, I, the two cultures are just so  completely different.  There's no way.  We're a little at odds.  Yep.  Sorry.  We couldn't make a deal.  That's what we have to do.  We got to shake hands and let them walk away with their thing that we don't want to fucking  buy from you.  It's just, and this, it's just terribly acted.  It's terribly shot.  Yeah.  The green screening is awful.  He's walking on a picture.  It's so bad.  Yeah. 
[00:17:00]  It's so bad.  I can't imagine that this is what, like, all these, these riots and.  It can't be.  And, uh, embassy attacks are based on.  That's the catalyst, obviously.  But they think that people watch this.  This is on American television.  This is what we're watching.  It's like, really?  Are you that fucking ignorant of Western culture?  You think that we would find this entertaining on NBC?  Yeah.  Stop it.  They're insulting us.  I'm thinking we would watch this.  It's on the internet.  It's on YouTube.  Yeah, yeah.  And YouTube didn't take it down.  In fairness to that, they shouldn't. 
[00:17:30]  Wow.  No, no.  If they did, they'd be held a paper.  Although your videos, I guess, are too offensive.  Yeah, I get it.  I get it.  I get it all the time.  Offensive.  But this is fine.  Whatever.  Um.  Yeah.  We're doomed.  Yeah, we are.  I went to the, uh, the history museum over the weekend.  The history?  Which history museum?  I go there every few years.  Museum of Natural History?  There you go.  On the Upper West Side.  Central Park West.  That shit is cool, man.  It's fucking great, that museum.  Except for the room with all the dead animals. 
[00:18:00]  What do you mean?  I'd rather see live animals.  You don't like the dead animal room?  They got an elephant.  Yeah.  But it's an elephant.  It's not a woolly mammoth.  I can understand a woolly mammoth all stuff.  Right.  Sure.  But just dead animals that you could still see in the wild or at a zoo.  Yeah, that's pretty famous, that elephant.  That's kind of creepy.  Yeah, I love them dinosaur bones.  Dude, I took a picture of the T-Rex and I just wrote, this will never not be cool.  I know.  It doesn't matter how old you are.  When you see the fucking...  There it is.  It's the second one in. 
[00:18:30]  The dinosaur bones.  That's the lobby or whatever.  Yeah, I took that picture.  Well, I...  Yeah.  You know, when I was a kid...  How cool is that?  It's very fucking cool.  That'll always be cool.  When I was a child and went there, they actually rebuilt that T-Rex because it was  it was standing the wrong way.  Yes, it was standing erect.  It was standing like Godzilla.  Kind of up on its hind legs, straight up.  And then they realized that it probably stood with its tail straight out, counterbalancing  how it used to lean forward with its little tiny arms. 
[00:19:00]  But they had him standing straight up like, hello, my baby.  Hello, my honey.  Can we find that picture somewhere?  And they put a top hat in his hand, which is a little cane.  So basically, the T-Rex had horrible posh...  Horrible.  Horrible.  He was leaning too far.  Yeah, there you go.  Like that.  Yeah, that's how we all remember growing up.  Yeah.  That's why I'm so mad at myself that I paid attention to school because a lot of the shit  we learn, they're finding out is just not right.  Yeah.  Well, we had, what, nine planets? 
[00:19:30]  I don't even remember anymore.  Yeah, we had nine.  We had nine.  Now there's eight.  They used to think he dragged his tail around on the ground and just kind of walked around  like that.  But yeah, meanwhile, hunched over.  But how did someone figure out that it was the other way?  I think it's just basic.  They look at other animals with similar, kind of smaller animals, but similar the way you  would run.  It's not economically, like energy economic economics. 
[00:20:00]  But someone who was in charge of the old dinosaur bones fucked up and said, nope, stood up  straight.  I don't even think they considered that he would have leaned over and used the tail as  a counterbalance.  What year did they decide that they were wrong and that this is the way it should be?  I think it was quite recently.  It is recent.  Really?  The last 10 or 15 years.  Maybe.  More?  Oh, yeah.  I think it's like when Jurassic Park came out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  After Jurassic Park, people were like, hey, look at that thing.  It's kind of leaning forward.  Dude, because birds have the same skeletons as they do. 
[00:20:30]  Like birds are their most direct descendants of Tyrannosaurus, and they stand up straight.  They don't walk over.  No, but they fly, too.  Oh, that's true.  This thing couldn't fly.  Yeah, little flying things.  Good point.  But man, when you see that shit, I don't care how old you are, it brings you back to being  a kid going, fuck, that is cool.  Yeah.  That T-Rex especially is the coolest.  The great field trip into the city.  Yep.  Where I would have to, there'd be quite a contrast between my joy and just how ecstatic I was going 
[00:21:00]  to the museum, and my complete fear that I was going to get lost in Manhattan and get  fucking killed and ass-raped as a child.  What's wrong with you?  Fuck, I don't know.  I had such a fear.  Really?  And if I lost, if I ever lost track of the field trip mom that used to be there, or the  teacher, I would just fucking, ah, start screaming and crying.  Well, you went to a cool school because I only remember one field trip to the city. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Maybe we did more.  Where'd you go?  Exactly.  Oh.  I could have seen the T-Rex, right, as a kid?  Yeah.  They, it was a trip to New York City to see, I've told the story already, but whatever,  for the newer listeners, Danny Kay.  Danny Kay!  I'm, that sounds like something I would have had to have done.  I'm 12.  How old is that?  For real, I'm like 12 years old.  Oh.  We didn't get to the city often.  Danny Kay! 
[00:22:00]  And we, you know, have the permission slips and our little lunch bags, and we jump on the  bus for the big trip to the city, which, you know, it was a good hour ride from where  we all lived, out there on Long Island, to see Danny Kay!  Wow.  Wow, that's been fun.  That's gay.  The music man.  The music man.  He would sing and dance and shit.  At Lincoln Center, I believe.  Wow.  You guys love it?  No.  Oh, how boring for a kid.  It was exciting because it was like, holy fuck, we're in the city, and it was exciting because  you go in this big theater, like, oh, wow, this is something I've never really seen 
[00:22:30]  before.  But then you're-  And then it's some fucking-  Looking at that.  Danny Kay, who, by the way, has been dead probably 30 years.  Yes, do the math.  He's been gone a long fucking time.  That was my field trip to the city.  Jesus.  That's the only one I remember.  They took us into the city once to see a Charlie Brown movie at Radio City Music Hall.  Really?  Yeah.  That would be kind of cool, right?  That was kind of cool.  It was, you know, fucking Charlie Brown.  And we used to go into the city. 
[00:23:00]  I went to the Museum of Natural History a few times.  See, you had a much- maybe my- I know what it was.  I bet you the Danny Kay trip was free.  Oh, really?  Because I think what happened was my mom- didn't you have to pay a few bucks for those trips?  Yeah, yeah.  You needed some money, and then the permission slipped.  I had a stupid mom who had a problem with money all the time, probably did the old passeroo when it came to the museum.  I'm pretty fucking-  I think you had to pay a little bit.  Yeah? 
[00:23:30]  It was a little extra, because you had to pay for the bus driver, the gas, and all that shit.  So I think they hammered out the kids for a few bucks.  It did cost you a few.  So I bet- I bet you there was a special on the Danny Kay field trip.  Danny Kay.  I can only imagine what the permission slip has turned into in this day and age, because  it's got to be a legally binding document that protects everyone involved.  Right.  I bet the word indemnify is in there a lot, and it's not- we had literally- it was a piece 
[00:24:00]  of one sheet of paper, and at the bottom, there was a dotted line where you ripped off  probably a quarter of that sheet of paper, where it said, I give my permission to have  my son or daughter, blah-di-blah-di-blah, and then you sign it, and that was your legally  binding document.  Now it's got to be just a thick binder of legalese.  When I was in elementary school, like, we wanted to go out to lunch, and there was  like across the street or down the road, a block or two, there was a pizzeria or whatever.  So my mom would just write a letter on like, you know, any piece of paper, please allow 
[00:24:30]  my child to go to lunch today, and that was completely final.  I was able to leave school grounds with my friends when I was like eight.  Wow.  When is that happening anymore?  Never.  And that wasn't even that long ago.  It's not like I'm a child of the 80s.  Right.  Exactly.  That's right.  Thank you, Danny.  It was all adult handwriting.  If it had adult handwriting, they accepted it.  That was a hard one to pull off when you were a kid, adult handwriting.  Fake adult handwriting was impossible.  We all tried.  Yeah.  Yeah, trying to trace it. 
[00:25:00]  We would practice.  Yeah, I got busted trying to forge my mom's signature on some shitty note that got sent  home.  Did that guy from Pawn Stars come with his briefcase and the magnifying glass?  Well, I'm seeing a lot of startups and stops in this signature.  They didn't need to call in an expert.  An expert.  Well, this note, I'm not sure if I'm going to accept it.  Do you mind if I call in one of my experts?  I think Chumlee took a look and was just like, no, that's not legit.  Oh, dude, this doesn't look good.  Nothing worse than a teacher sending you home with some paperwork.  Like, maybe it was bad grades or something.  All right.  You know, you have to get your parents to sign this and you're like, how fucking and then 
[00:25:30]  you'd be in your room and you would like you said, you're like, I think I can fuck.  I think I got it.  I think I got it.  How crazy is it?  Like, like that they would make you go home with your own shitty thing to have to then  give it to your parents.  It was like the worst.  If I grew up in the 50s, I guess it would be the equivalent of like having to go and  find the stick to get beat with.  You find a switch.  A switch.  50s.  I had to find my own stick.  It just made sense.  It was like, I had to find my own stick to get beat up.  Why would you give me the opportunity to get rid of this? 
[00:26:00]  Like, I never understood that.  That was the one thing I could never get.  Take it home.  You got to learn responsibility.  Fuck that.  I'm throwing this out.  I lost it.  I don't know.  I never got it.  I don't know what she's talking about.  But man, that T-Rex made my fucking day.  I was just like, yes.  Now we're talking.  Then they got the big blue whale.  Yeah.  In that museum.  That's obviously not a real blue whale.  No, that's a fake.  They just figured out it was that big.  And someone made that shit.  Yeah.  Pretty impressive, though.  Did you see any specific exhibits? 
[00:26:30]  Nah.  Because I had the kid, and we didn't know how long it was going to last.  He ended up lasting about an hour, which was great.  Yeah.  What does he do?  What happens after an hour?  Does he start, like, hanging on your hand a little more?  He just got really sleepy, actually, this time.  So he just crashed.  But these museums, I want people to know, your museums are free.  It's part of being an American and paying your taxes.  But how they make their money is they have the special exhibits. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  Like, well, this is a special exhibit, so you're going to have to pay $25, $30, whatever, per person.  But when you go up to the admission thing, they pressure you in paying a lot of money.  So I just tell the guy, what's the minimum?  Because I thought we were going to be there 15 minutes, because we were walking by with my son.  They want a donation to her.  And I go enough, and I give them enough money where they, I'm good.  And they're like, well, I'll tell you the truth, you don't have to pay anything.  I'm like, exactly.  Wow.  But they look at you like, but you're not going to be that guy, are you? 
[00:27:30]  That's for the homeless people that want to come in and fucking look around.  I got sucked in.  I went there.  Well, it says suggested, but the suggested is in the tiniest font.  So it's like suggested, and then general admission in big letters.  Suggested general admission.  And the general admission is like, I forgot what it was.  I think it was like $29 a person that I was looking for.  Yeah, it's pretty decent.  So I go, look, man.  There was a whole bunch of us.  I'm paying.  I'm like, what's the minimum?  He's like, well, actually, you don't have to pay anything.  I'm like, yeah, exactly.  But then I grabbed some pocket money and hand it to him. 
[00:28:00]  I'm like, here you go.  That's what you're getting from me.  General admission is $19.  $19, okay.  Fake general admission.  But then if you want to go see the special, like the exhibitions and everything.  See, I got sucked into this.  I went to see the Creatures of Light.  Oh, you did go?  How cool was it?  Because I saw it.  I wanted to go, but I knew we wouldn't last.  Have you seen Planet Earth on Discovery Channel?  Yeah, of course.  Have you seen the episode about bioluminescence?  You saw it.  Okay.  That's pretty much it.  Yeah, but it's probably- 
[00:28:30]  Watching that in the dark is better than going to that exhibit.  But do they have real shit there?  No.  Oh.  It's all fucking made out of fabric and bullshit.  Oh, man.  And they're making you pay for that?  Dude, you know what it felt like?  Have you been to the Hall of Science recently?  Not in a long time.  Dude, like, it's a fucking relic.  It really is a relic.  It's like going to a drive-in movie theater.  It's like the same nostalgia.  That fucking exhibit, Creatures of Light, felt like the Hall of Science.  All right, I'm so glad, because I was kind of bummed. 
[00:29:00]  I'm like, man, maybe we should have went to the Creatures of Light.  I know, it didn't sound like something that was-  But to the people out there that I know they don't have a lot of money, don't fucking let  them hammer you.  Christmas.  You can walk right in.  It's a suggested donation, right?  They call it-  Suggested.  Yeah.  They're making a shitload of money, because people are just-  People, you know, they just see general admission.  They're paying it.  They're just handing over their credit cards.  You can just walk straight through if you want?  Well, I think they want you to have a ticket for whatever reason.  But you can just get a ticket.  No one checked for my tickets in the end.  I guess it takes a while, some money to dust off them bones. 
[00:29:30]  Have the little feather duster.  No, I get it.  I get it to a point, but trust me, enough people are paying a lot of money.  And I live close.  I go there from time to time.  I pay every time I go.  Yeah.  I just don't feel like paying their general admission suggested price.  Is that bad?  I don't know.  Is it?  I don't think it's bad.  They fucking kill you at every turn, this government of ours.  Let me have my free museum.  Free museum? 
[00:30:00]  They ain't making me want to go, though.  Just kind of walk through the museum.  It's pretty goddamn cool.  They had another exhibit.  I don't know if it's there anymore.  I should see it.  Did you do the space part of the museum?  I still haven't done that.  That's the only section I haven't done.  What, like the planetarium section?  Yeah.  That's good.  I haven't been there in a long time, but I did go to one of the, like,  Journey to the Stars or some shit exhibit.  And it was like, whatever.  But the only cool thing that they did have, or maybe it wasn't cool.  They had that augmented reality shit that you could fuck with on your phone.  So you could download the app before you go through.  And then you could point to this little barcode-y thing. 
[00:30:30]  And then it'll be like this image, this 3D image that you could kind of, you know, kind of go around.  But it was just like these little, it was like PlayStation graphics, you know?  It was like, it was cool.  It would have been cool like 15 years ago.  Right.  Like, it's cool that I'm doing it on my phone.  Yeah.  But the actual, yeah, the actual graphic of it.  It was like, oh, yeah, polygons.  Cool.  Look, they're making enough money with their suggested admission.  Fucking update your shit.  You know, it looked like, you remember Star Fox?  Cool.  Yeah, I liked going to the Planetarium. 
[00:31:00]  And we did that once, too, as a field trip, by the way.  The Hayden Planetarium.  The Hayden Planetarium.  The Hayden Planetarium.  We went local, Vanderbilt.  Oh, you went Vanderbilt?  We went local.  That was like right around the corner from your house.  No kidding.  I'm like, gee, thanks.  I'll just walk.  Field trip to around the corner from where I grew up.  Yeah.  Good times.  But I was walking through those exhibits thinking, how long have those exhibits just been in that museum?  Sitting there.  As is.  How long?  Some of them probably 100 years, right? 
[00:31:30]  Jeez.  Who knows, man.  And they look like they put them there yesterday.  Yeah.  How long?  Does anyone know?  The caveman exhibit?  The caveman behind the glass?  Yeah.  But how long?  They haven't fucking updated that.  Since I was a kid.  There's no reason to update it.  Quite a few years.  Yeah, there's no new info.  And no one's touching it.  You know?  And then just seeing, like, this was wandering the earth 680 billion zillion years ago.  You're like, oh, great.  My life means shit.  There were monsters back then.  Huh?  There were monsters, Rob, walking around. 
[00:32:00]  Real live monsters.  But their lives didn't mean shit either.  No!  A T-Rex?  How many years did a T-Rex get, you think?  A lot more than humans.  No, I mean an individual T-Rex.  Oh, individual.  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe 10 to 12, I would guess.  Yeah, they got nothing.  We talk about generations and things getting better.  Go to the museum.  If you want to see, like, from the 1960s to now, go to the museum and find me one 50-year  block of time.  Right.  It's nothing under 100,000 years.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they're okay saying stuff like, did you bring it up? 
[00:32:30]  If you did, I apologize.  But we estimate this Rome, the Earth, 600 to 650 million years ago.  They're off by 50 million.  50 million.  But in their world, that is completely acceptable.  Yeah.  A 50 million year period.  They could be off by 50 million years.  50 million years.  Or whatever.  It's a lot of time.  Exactly.  It's like, you're right, they do do that.  600 to 650 million years.  Right.  Somewhere in that basic area. 
[00:33:00]  I feel like there's a schmuck with, like, a lab coat just going, I don't know, go 620  to 630 on this.  Yeah, it's just 620 to 630 million years ago.  Put it on the plaque.  Right.  Throw it in front of this display.  I have no clue.  I have no idea.  And no one will care.  But you look at the dinosaurs, then you think about the idiots that think, you know, Jesus  himself was riding T-Rexes and it's like, gosh.  He was cradling fucking velociraptors.  Come on.  Can we at least agree on that?  No.  Come on.  There's enough experts that can prove that it's not right. 
[00:33:30]  He put the bones in the ground to test your faith.  Oh, right, right.  That's what happened.  That's another big one.  He put the bones in the ground.  Did you tweet me that shit this weekend, you motherfucker?  No.  Someone did.  Do they really think that?  Yes.  Well, that's the new thing.  It's the conspiracy shit.  I got to tell you, that's a clever one.  That is good.  If you want to keep your faithful from going, hmm, why are there fossils, then?  It's like a twist to a movie.  Yeah.  Fucking God and Jesus always testing people back in the day. 
[00:34:00]  That's lazy writing in a movie.  Yes, it is.  Are you kidding me?  That's lazy writing where you think the movie's so cool and they throw that at you like,  really?  That's the best you could do?  Sitting around a fucking table?  It really is the butler.  Come on, guys.  Don't do more.  Yeah, that's just terrible.  Bill Hicks talked about that?  Wow.  Like 20 years ago?  Uh, E-Rock, you got that?  Hope it wasn't recent.  I don't have that one.  I don't know a lot of Bill Hicks material, so I need a name of the track.  Okay.  Oh.  You should know Bill Hicks.  What's wrong with you?  Sorry.  Bill Hicks was a fucking legend. 
[00:34:30]  What are you, more Sinbad kind of guy?  Probably.  Sinbad.  No.  Who's your favorite comedian in E-Rock?  Carlin.  Just because everyone else says it?  No, I grew up, I had all his cassettes.  Cassettes.  Yeah.  Oh.  Pop him in and just start laughing.  What am I doing in New Jersey?  Live in New York.  Jamming in New York.  Look at you.  Thanks for my stuff.  You know, it was easy to like Carlin, especially for me, because he was always on Showtime,  and I had Showtime growing up.  Always, yeah, yeah.  And they would play those Carlin, our specials. 
[00:35:00]  Showtime or HBO?  Maybe it was HBO, I'm sorry.  HBO, yeah.  And I'm not embarrassed, because he's funny.  Gallagher maybe was on Showtime.  He was on Showtime all the time.  Gallagher was the Showtime guy.  And they were always on, so it was Carlin on HBO and Gallagher on Showtime, and they played  them all the time.  Those were events, man.  Growing up, that's all I would want.  I would like to go high and watch them and laugh your asses off.  Obviously two very different comics, but two very funny guys.  Yeah, of course.  Gallagher's an underrated comedian.  He's hilarious.  He didn't stink.  He was a funny.  He always did topical shit.  He always had political stuff. 
[00:35:30]  You can't fucking stink and get fucking 800 specials.  It's just shitty, because you want to say that he's funny, but there's such a stigma about  saying, like, Gallagher's not that bad.  Now, I know he's a racist.  That was hilarious.  And that was a time when Comedy Central was just kind of trying to find its own voice.  It didn't know what it wanted to be.  Yeah.  Are we doing stand-up comics?  Are we doing shitty movies?  And you couldn't have that kind of language, so those specials, that was the only kind  of place to find that stuff.  Hearing curses on TV is very fucking cool. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  We're going to end the day.  Oh, my God.  I think I might remember, uh, Eddie Murphy's Raw.  Raw, yeah.  I was a tiny child.  Oh, and then you hear a fucking cocksucker.  A tiny child.  Holy fuck.  That was like 84.  You mean Delirious?  The first one was Delirious.  Maybe it was Delirious.  We talked about all the kids in school annoyed me so much the next day when Delirious came  out.  I was like a sophomore in high school, and they kept talking about it.  I was so annoyed, because I'm like, don't you understand?  This is prior. 
[00:36:30]  I was so, I got into so many fucking arguments in high school about that, because Eddie Murphy  was very funny, but I kind of resented him at that moment, because everybody was talking  about him, and it was like, wait, what are you doing, you dummies?  He's just doing prior?  I did.  It just annoyed me.  I loved the Eddie Murphy, and I didn't make that connection when I was in high school.  The fucking bit, the Honeymooners bit was hilarious.  That was the, he was talking about Norton fucking him in the ass.  Yeah.  Tighten up my butt cheeks.  Or Mr. T.  Mr. T getting fucked in the ass. 
[00:37:00]  It's fucking crazy.  Clenching up my butt cheeks and rip your dick off.  Rip your dick off.  Ugh.  Ugh.  He's moaning.  He was 22 when he did that.  That's ridiculous.  I believe 22.  I'm going to bend over, Norton.  When I bend over, I want you to start fucking.  That's ridiculous.  Yeah.  And the, uh, let Elvis just sing all of his lines.  He had some very funny shit.  Oh, yeah.  We're going to win this race.  Lemonade.  That cool, refreshing drink.  Yeah.  God damn, that was fucking funny. 
[00:37:30]  That was 83.  83.  Yeah.  That was a long ass time ago.  He was king shit.  Not if it's in a museum.  Ah, right.  Not if it's in a museum.  It was between, uh, 1983 and the year, uh, uh, 62 or 35.  I want to start going to more museums.  Yeah?  There's a lot of cool ones in New York.  Have you been to the Air and Space Museum?  Of course.  We went together, you dope.  Oh, that's right.  Washington.  Remember?  No, I mean the one here at, uh, on the, uh, Intrepid.  Now, now.  Oh, yeah, I have been. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Years ago.  But now I got to see the space shuttle.  The space shuttle.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Oh, you found Jesus and the dinosaurs?  Oh.  Is that, by the way, during the day?  The, uh, space shuttle?  Like, you can just go there today and see it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why don't I go there?  It's like in the middle of the afternoon.  I should just traipse on down.  You should.  There are plenty of, uh, great things to see in this space city.  The Intrepid is a, that's a cool day.  I want to go there.  That's cool.  How long does it take?  You just walk around the ship.  You can be there for hours if you want.  That used to be a school trip, too. 
[00:38:30]  Intrepid?  Intrepid.  Wow.  Really?  I went for the first time only a few years ago.  I want to go and walk with a very flamboyant gait.  I want to walk with a flamboyant gait for the entire thing for no reason.  Yeah.  Getting on the submarine is pretty creepy.  Oh, yeah.  They got that.  It's kind of underwater, too.  Oh.  Yeah.  They submerge it.  It's submerged a little bit.  You start thinking, like, what would that fucking be like to be just bolted into that fucking  thing?  I think it'd be cool as hell, but it'd be scary.  I'd be a little scared.  I'd start thinking about how much water is on top of you. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  You're just in a little tin can.  Do you think a weekday is bad?  Is there all schools there and kids, or is it probably...  It's better than weekends.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey.  Get into the sub.  No one's going on school trips the first week or two of schools.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a good point.  That's a good point.  The cruise ships park pretty much right next to it, and guess what?  All those dopes.  They go, oh, let's do this.  It's right here.  It's always crowded, to be honest with you.  Maybe right after the show it'd be all right.  It's very popular.  That's what I'm thinking, because I've walked by there on a Sunday when I was taking my walks. 
[00:39:30]  Your strolls.  Yeah.  And it's always crowded.  Mm-hmm.  Always.  Yeah.  It's worth checking out.  You know how it is when you're exercising every day?  You're like, you know...  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I'm back exercising today.  Yeah.  My hay fever is much better today.  Hey.  Finally.  Yeah.  How much did you eat?  We went to Amy's last night, which you didn't go to.  Oh, that was fun.  Why?  I was supposed to.  Yeah.  What a trashing DeRosa got.  Oh, I missed it!  Oh, my God.  God damn it! 
[00:40:00]  Wait, you didn't go either?  I did, but I left it all.  I was too tired.  Once Keith Robinson showed up...  I was leaving as Keith came in.  It just got ugly.  Give me another swirl!  He's drinking his fucking wine and shit, and just...  DeRosa was talking to some girl.  Yeah.  Bobby showed up.  And then, on my way out, I saw Bill Berg coming in.  Oh, Bill came fucked.  Yeah, Bill showed up.  Tom Papa was there.  Questlove was there, and John Mayer.  It was good.  It was fun.  It was hilarious.  We were sitting there just trashing, trashing DeRosa, who was talking... 
[00:40:30]  He was off talking to somebody, some girl.  So he was minding his own business?  And we were all going through what the conversation was about, and it was fucking hilarious.  I'm a director.  Yeah.  Oh, it just got so ugly.  We owe me an apology, because we forgot.  We literally just forgot.  And we're laying around watching Louie.  I'm catching up on Louie's show.  I'm a little behind, and I'm like, holy fuck, that was today.  We're idiots. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, it was fun.  She's going to now think we blew her off.  We just went for a little while.  How many times did you...  I left at like 10...  I was so...  I left on Collins, and I was too fucking...  I was falling asleep.  Oh, you stayed at...  Yeah, Collins showed up.  I was in bed by 10.30.  Fucking great.  Why is she having these barbecues every once in a while?  She just got a new apartment, and she has a great rooftop, and...  Very cool rooftop.  Oh, is it in the city, too?  Is it Manhattan?  Yeah.  How far from us?  I'll say this.  It was a six-minute cab ride.  Oh, wow.  Oh, God.  What's wrong with us?  A nice rooftop. 
[00:41:30]  And then I...  It's funny.  As I was leaving, I saw Questlove from The Roots.  That's his name?  Questlove, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was DJing.  And I didn't realize he was there until he said, hey, and then he started talking about  we're back.  He goes, you didn't notice when you came out, we were playing the Van Halen song.  I'm like, no, we had a nice chat.  Does he listen to the show?  He's very familiar with it.  I don't know if he's a regular listener or if he had found it on YouTube, but he's like,  that's how I found out they were getting back together from listening to that.  Oh, that's funny.  So I guess he was familiar with the show.  DJing in Amy's party last night.  It was pretty fucking cool. 
[00:42:00]  We literally forgot.  I missed Bill.  Today's the day.  Oh, my God.  Oh, well.  What time did dumb Bill get there?  About midnight.  Oh, okay.  He came late.  Isn't Burr doing a lot of radio with us this week?  Yeah.  Yes.  Bill's starting what?  Tomorrow?  He's here tomorrow or Wednesday?  Caroline's Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  You know, that's going to sell.  Yeah, he'll sell that.  Someone tweeted.  I think it's true, too.  It's been five years since he beat the shit out of Philly.  That famous...  2006.  The video, unfortunately.  I know Pete has a much better version of that. 
[00:42:30]  I know I should ask him.  I know they taped those virus shows for whatever reason.  Obviously, they've got to sign off on shit to ever make anything of it, but they had to  be rolling tape.  That means someone has a great copy of Bill Burr taking on the audience.  Yeah.  Because the version on YouTube still does incredibly well, but it's not the greatest copy.  Yeah.  I'm definitely going next Friday.  Burr?  It's Friday going to Burr, yeah.  I went and I took the ride and saw Kelly over the weekend.  Oh, yeah.  How's the club?  Funny, man. 
[00:43:00]  Levity's great.  I've been there a couple times.  Went and saw Brewer there.  It's a really nice place.  Right.  Really nice.  Fucking Bobby.  He kept farting last night, and we're on a rooftop.  It's outside.  And you can still smell it?  And he fucking...  Everyone just went scattering.  Oh, my God.  And he's just laughing.  Yeah, dude.  What?  What?  Ah.  He had some really funny stuff, man.  Bobby had a great show.  Yeah.  I love it.  He's live.  Oh, good.  Bobby a funny motherfucker.  He is a funny...  He is a funny...  He's an underrated comic. 
[00:43:30]  Bobby is?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because he's such an awful person.  But he's a very underrated stand-up.  Oh, he is funny, man.  Fucking funny.  Well, we all know that, but...  Yeah.  I haven't seen him on stage in a long time.  Because, you know, if you see guys at the cellar, we only interact upstairs.  You know, we don't go down and watch each other unless you happen to be cutting through  the room to piss.  You don't know who came was Gnome.  Because he lives close.  Oh, right.  Up in Worcester.  Comedy Central.  Comedy Central.  Comedy Cellar guy.  Gnome.  Did you talk to him?  Yeah, of course.  He's a good dude.  Yeah, he's a great guy. 
[00:44:00]  I haven't talked to him in a while.  This means nothing to anyone.  This is way too inside.  Well, people know who Gnome is, I think.  He's a really nice guy.  Solid.  Smart guy, too, huh?  Yeah, very.  They have a little podcast they do.  And, like, you know, he likes this show.  He's been very nice.  He likes what?  Our show?  Yes.  Yeah, me and Anthony's show.  Well, hello, Gnome.  That's it, I guess.  And then I turned off my phone over the weekend.  I turned on these fucking AT&T assholes. 
[00:44:30]  Why?  Because I didn't pay my bill.  Those assholes.  I didn't pay my bill.  I wish I had recorded the conversation I had with the lady.  She goes, I was losing my mind.  Because my wife could have a baby any day.  I'm in that fucking zone right now.  You can't be incommunicado.  And all of a sudden, I'm texting my brother because I want to see if he wants to go to Bob Kelly.  And it said, can't send text.  I'm like, that's weird.  Then I try to call.  And it says, your phone's been shut off. 
[00:45:00]  I'm like, how old am I?  Am I in college?  I've never had my phone shut off, even when I was really fucking poor.  So there's some, but they allowed me to call AT&T.  Yeah.  And then I'm losing my mind.  I'm like, do you understand my wife could have a baby any day?  And if I don't, if I was out and about and she was, you know.  Oh, they don't care.  Of course.  Why would they care?  So then the lady said the wrong thing.  She goes, well, if you paid your bill on time.  Oh, shit.  So I go, listen, smart ass. 
[00:45:30]  You called her smart ass?  A million times.  And I know they were recording it.  Listen, smart ass.  I go, look at the screen in front of you.  Look at my billing history.  Yeah.  Do you see that I'm one of these customers that, you know, balance, you know, juggles all their bills and I let my fucking cell phone bill go every once in a while?  I go, I don't think, I don't think I've been late on a cell phone bill in well over 20 years.  They should check your history before they jump on you.  Because sometimes it does happen and they just put you in that piece of shit category where they treat you like a piece of shit. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, she's like, she was, I went right for the main person too.  I'm like, I don't know who you are, but I said, I know there's someone that has a little more fucking power than you.  I need them right now.  Get them.  And I got her.  And she couldn't have been more of a twat.  Yeah.  I don't like saying the C word.  Go ahead, just once.  Love it.  She was a cunt.  Oh, my.  She was.  And I'm like, look, obviously something fell through the cracks. 
[00:46:30]  And I don't even know to this day.  Why don't you auto pay on your credit card?  Well, I got to do all that, obviously.  It's the best, right?  But I pay my bills.  I don't know if I fucked it up.  And I don't know.  I don't know what happened.  But something obviously happened that doesn't.  It's very rare for me and my cell phone bill.  And she kept going back to, well, if you paid your bill.  You know what you got to say.  I go, shut up, smart ass.  I heard you the first time.  I go, how do you contact someone before you shut off their phone?  Because this is bad, especially if someone's wife is pregnant. 
[00:47:00]  Well, we emailed you.  I go, all right, what's the email address you got on file?  And like I told Anthony before the show, I really don't know what my old AOL email address is.  Yeah, yeah.  So I'll just say, Greg18 at AOL.com.  I'm like, AOL?  AOL?  I haven't signed on to AOL in probably 12 years.  I was 18 when I made that.  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  So they had an old AOL email for me to contact me.  AOL?  Jesus. 
[00:47:30]  And then they're like, well, we tried calling you.  And I go, look, this is what I'm trying to tell you guys.  Your system is flawed.  All right?  Yeah.  Because if I see a 1-800 or an 866 number or something that just says AT&T, I'm not picking up that phone call ever.  Why would I?  You think it's one of those fucking telemarketers.  Yeah, because I'm not going to assume that they're going to shut off my phone and they're calling me to warn me.  I'm assuming they're going to try to sell me shit.  Yeah.  So I'm like, there's a problem here.  Well, if you pay your bill on time. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, and she couldn't wait to say that.  You know what you should say to her?  She loves saying that to people.  You have to say to her, look, you might not understand this.  I'm a white man.  And that would have had to change the entire tone.  I shouldn't be treated like this.  Yeah, you should have said, you're talking to a white man, miss.  Yes.  So then I had to pay with my credit card on the phone.  How long did it take to get the phone back on?  Minutes.  Oh, okay.  But I'm just amazed that my phone got shut off.  Because I guess whatever happened to the bill that I know I sent, something got fucked up. 
[00:48:30]  And then the new bill was due on the 15th.  So on the 15th, they're like, well, fuck this guy.  And they shut us down.  Man.  Is that possible?  Yeah, they don't have to be late for a while.  You'd think, right?  So now it's like, I guess technically I was late for two bills.  I guess now they figure, especially with a phone, they just flip it off and they know  you're going to fucking try to get it turned back on.  Right.  So it's like, why would they not shut it off if they want you to pay?  Especially if they emailed you and called you. 
[00:49:00]  I'll say this in their defense.  They don't, we have to update.  Sometimes you update with one operator.  Right.  And then you'll call back and they're still like, are you at Yellow Trees?  I'm like, no, I haven't been at Yellow Trees in five years, six years.  It doesn't update through the whole system, but if they called you and they, believe  me, it used to be Tinkle Drinker before these fucking pussies at AOL flagged me for terms  of service, it would be Tinkle Drinker.  And I would, I would have to say Tinkle Drinker at AOL.com.  Given like, has a CSR have to confirm with you?  Are you Yellow Treats at AOL?  Oh, man.  All the time.  Yellow Treats.  Yeah.  I guess my point is if they, uh, cause no one, you know, it's an old bit at this point, 
[00:49:30]  but no one uses their phones anymore for phone calls.  So if you texted me and said, we're shutting your phone off, you know, call us immediately.  Guess what?  I would.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I looked back at my text messages and there are AT&T texts talking about data usage  and, and if you want to upgrade your plan, all that horseshit type stuff, but nothing  that says that they're going to shut off my phone, look, tips on how to use your data.  Look at all these. 
[00:50:00]  Not one of them from A&T saying, look, we're shutting off your phone.  See?  Look at that.  Yeah.  It's all just about data usage.  Yeah.  Oh, that one's, that's it.  That data usage.  Why wouldn't they text me and go, hey, hello, we're shutting off your phone.  You might want to call us.  By the way, that hotspot thing you can use on your phone, I used it in the improv, cause  improvs typically have terrible wifi for some reason.  So I tried to fucking use, it's awesome.  Oh, you do eat a lot of data, but it's, uh, it's really awesome to use it as a hotspot.  I didn't, I never tried that. 
[00:50:30]  I was just like so annoyed.  I'm like, fuck it.  Yeah.  Use it with a sling box.  Watch your data go fucking through the roof.  And then meanwhile, I, you know what I did?  I fell asleep with the sling box going, uh, overnight.  So it was, it was going on the hotspot for probably five hours.  Oh, wow.  Of just streaming television.  Nice.  So, yeah, whoops.  How much is that going to cost?  Uh, I don't know.  I didn't, uh, I didn't go over yet. 
[00:51:00]  Wow.  Really?  They said I'm 50%.  Oh, cool.  Oh, I'm, I'm over a hundred percent and I'm not watching TV on my phone.  What the fuck are you doing?  I don't know.  I think that don't make no sense.  That don't make no sense.  Something is not right.  I gotta, I don't know.  I don't know what's, what I'm doing.  Hmm.  I have no idea.  I hate the data fucking charges.  I used to like when it was, uh, it was pretty much free.  Maybe the titanium in my legs is messing up the signal.  Jeez, Gary Sinise.  Yeah.  Lieutenant Dan.  You should say, you should call them and go, look, my fat Asian fiancee, Susan, might 
[00:51:30]  need the phone.  Fiancee.  Fiancee.  This is my fiancee, Susan.  Is it?  I don't know.  Yeah, but Bobby was great.  That Levity Live Club, um, you know, is a really nice place to see comedy.  Oh, cool.  They haven't gotten you up there yet?  I think we've talked about it.  Hmm.  I may do it.  I'm, you know, I mean, it's just, I haven't booked a date there.  Oh, okay.  Um, so, uh, was it Nyack? 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  Nyack.  West Nyack.  Yes.  West Nyack.  It's on a route.  Ow.  As Bob Kelly pointed out, which was kind of funny.  It's a nice club.  Well, he walked down, he's like, wow, look at my fucking career.  I'm in a comedy club in a mall that's off a route.  Off a route?  It's that route.  It's on route something.  It's basically the route that, uh, takes you right to the Tappan Z.  Ah.  The old Tappan Z. 
[00:52:30]  What is it?  Uh, on the way to Brewster?  There's always signs for Brewster.  I always know Jim Brewer whenever I drive up there because it's close to his name.  Brewster.  Brewster, New York.  Yeah.  It's nice up there, man.  Yeah.  I like nature.  I like hearing crickets.  Nature blows.  Fuck nature.  I was at my brother's house, uh, Brett, the owner of FH Riley's, on Friday night having  a little ice cream and hid, uh, my, uh, dad's old wood-burning stove in his backyard so we  just fucking sit around in lounge chairs.  It's awesome. 
[00:53:00]  It's awesome.  It really is.  Yeah.  And I'm just listening to crickets going, fuck, I forgot about crickets.  This city living stinks.  I forgot them too and I went and saw Voss.  I get an assist for that.  I'm keeping track of assists now.  Hey.  But just the sound of, like, crickets.  Ah.  You hear crickets in your backyard, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  How cool is that?  It's, uh, well, it's, you know.  It relaxes your heart.  Does it?  Yes. 
[00:53:30]  Does it?  Yes.  I opened the window last night because, you know, it's that time of year you get a little  nice breeze.  Oh, I need the air conditioner.  And all I hear, I am, I am literally 500 feet in the air if you really figure it all  out.  Mm-hmm.  And I'm hearing traffic like it's right outside my window.  How is that possible?  It really is amazing.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  I can't keep my windows open.  That sound does carry.  That's stupid West Side Highway.  And at any moment, you feel like someone is just going to go flying into the Hudson River.  These lunatics down there. 
[00:54:00]  I don't mind a little background traffic noise.  Oh, it's the worst.  I don't mind it.  When I lived on 43rd Street, I was on the 22nd floor.  You'd hear it.  Right.  And as long as it's not a blaring horn, like if it's just like that in the background,  I can kind of sleep with it.  Yeah, but people can't help themselves.  They got to hit that horn no matter where they are.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm that guy.  I've noticed they've made it harder to hit your horn, though, huh?  Anyone else notice that?  Really?  It's harder to hit the horn.  In my car, it's harder to hit the horn. 
[00:54:30]  I have to really fucking punch.  Really?  Yeah, and you can't really do it with your thumbs anymore.  No, no, no, no.  Oh, I'm the fucking...  With the fist?  Hammer blow.  I do the hammer blow.  Bop!  Fucking move!  What the fuck happened at Radio City Music Hall?  Oh, yeah.  For the people that read this story, it's pretty much right outside our building.  It's like a half a block away.  Fucking what?  An airport van is just minding their own business, getting a little early airport run in? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, and some guy decided to blow one of the red lights.  Well, they were drag racing up 6th Avenue because it was 4.30 in the morning, no traffic  around, and just fucking destroyed the airport van.  Anyone die in that?  No.  No.  There were...  I heard there were critical injuries.  One person went flying out of...  Yeah, I heard there were a few ejected.  How do you fly out of shit?  An accident that may have injured some bathers.  Look at that.  I mean, there's pictures online if you want to check it out.  That looks like a...  It was horrific.  People thought it was a movie shoot.  Really? 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, because there was debris everywhere, and the car looked like it couldn't have been  in a real accident because it was really fucked up.  Right.  Why is Eon?  Huh?  I don't look at the fucking Kardashians.  What the fuck is that?  I don't have a news channel on.  We usually have that fucking fuck channel.  That fucking show.  The Kardashians?  It drives me nuts.  I don't...  I literally never watched it.  It just drives me nuts because of how well it does.  I just don't understand.  I don't understand people's viewing habits.  I know.  I even like a little junk TV, but I don't get it. 
[00:56:00]  Dude, they look like clowns.  Like, I'm looking at Bruce Jenner with his bad burn victim wig and his bad facial work and  his two earrings, and he looks like a clown.  He looks like an idiot.  He looks like...  I mean, it's been said on the internet a million times.  He looks like an old lesbian.  He looks fucking...  Look at her lip.  Look at her lip.  Look at that.  Because she wants to be more famous than her daughters.  Why is this even on?  Who put this...  I don't want to watch this.  I don't know.  Why is E on?  I don't want this on my fucking eyeline.  I'm not interested in it.  Yeah, yeah.  It's probably on since the weekend.  Put on the fucking... 
[00:56:30]  And the weird part is they're absolutely beautiful.  I would never say they're not, but they have nothing to say.  No.  But that's perfect.  So what?  All these people just watch to stare at them?  That's perfect.  Because they literally have nothing to say.  Society.  It's perfect.  I just think it's just silly.  Who's that in the bikini?  I don't know.  You know what's hilarious to me?  Like Kim Kardashian, you know, she's obviously really hot and stuff.  Yeah.  But Bruce Jenner's daughter with this Kris Jenner broad is going to be the fucking star of the family. 
[00:57:00]  Is that the standout?  She's already modeling.  She's like...  I think she's only like 15 or 16, and she's already like six foot tall.  Wow.  Wow.  Really?  She's way hotter.  I should say going to be way hotter, but you could already tell.  So I don't know.  I don't understand the Kardashians at all.  It drives me fucking nuts.  I don't partake.  I just can't sit there and watch that.  My chick puts it on sometimes, and it just ends up...  She'll leave it on, and I'm not paying attention to it, so it's just on. 
[00:57:30]  But I hear some of their conversations in and out, and it's just inane.  It's just nothing.  There's nothing there.  There's absolutely nothing going on.  I don't understand how it's a television show.  There's nothing.  Like Ozzy, you know, the Osbournes.  Yeah.  That's good junk TV, but there was some shit going on there.  It was cool.  Yeah, that was interesting, funny.  This is just like nonsense.  It's just like, oh, I'm going to pretend...  Let's play a prank on my dad.  We're going to pretend that the Lamborghini got stolen, but no, it wasn't. 
[00:58:00]  It's just like, this is a fucking show.  We're going to New York to just walk around and shop.  That's Courtney.  I know.  Who's just horrendous.  That's her voice.  Monotone personality.  We're going to go to New York, and we're going to walk around with cameras following us,  and we're going to shop for a while.  Wow, I want to see that.  Nothing is...  They don't come up with any of that stuff.  It's all the famous assist to reality.  Yes.  They're like, okay, this week, you guys are going to make believe Bruce Jenner's 
[00:58:30]  Lamborghini was stolen.  Okay.  Hilarious.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It doesn't offend me.  I look at it the way I just look at it like insects flying around.  It's just irritating, but like, it's...  I just swat them away.  It's terrible.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  Yeah.  Oh, I want to play the Bill Hicks to break about dinosaurs.  I saw you found that.  Dinosaurs.  Was it a good copy of that?  Bill Hicks was great.  I didn't preview it, but it looks like it was great.  I wish I saw him do stand-up live. 
[00:59:00]  Bill Hicks, Jesus, and the Dinosaurs as we go to break here.  And we're back.  Yeah.  Terrific.  Hopi, Anthony, and Jim Norton.  We got Richie Sambora coming in today.  What?  Yeah.  He's doing a solo record.  Man.  What is he doing with Denise Richards these days?  Are they still an item?  No, they broke up.  Ah, but they were back a little bit.  They were doing something with each other there.  What's that? 
[00:59:30]  They broke up again last year.  Yeah.  Denise Richards, thumbs up, down.  Where are you at with that?  Um, well, I don't want to offend Richie Sambora.  Oh, that means thumbs down.  No, she was definitely a looker in her day.  What was that movie?  Yeah, we always talk about that one.  Car wash.  The, uh...  Car wash.  No, I mean where she's washing the car.  Yeah, wild things.  Wild things, yeah.  Wild things.  She was, uh...  She still looks good. 
[01:00:00]  She looks good in that crazy space movie, too.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Is that her fingering her asshole?  No?  Huh?  It must be.  It's on page one of Denise Richards' Wild Things.  Gotta be.  She's fingering her own asshole.  Two fingers.  She's giving the old, uh...  The fucking sign of the devil.  You guys see the Kate Middleton topless shots?  Oh, do tell.  The internet's abuzz.  Yes, it is.  And the royal family is gonna sue.  Sue everyone.  Lawyer for British royal family to file criminal complaint over topless Kate photos. 
[01:00:30]  Punitive damage is here.  Is that Kate Middleton?  Yeah.  Oh, she's nice fucking heavy tits.  Holy mackerel.  She has heavy tits.  Why such a grainy fucking picture?  That's how far the guy was?  Exactly.  They were going around fucking British Secret Service.  It was taken from the intrepid.  No kidding.  You know how hard it is to get pictures of what is the equivalent of a queen's tits?  And the first thing we say is why is it grainy?  Why is it grainy?  They say they have more intimate photos, too. 
[01:01:00]  Oh.  So I think maybe...  Yeah, there's like 26 pages or something of photos.  So why these photos?  What do you mean?  Like, what was she doing?  Oh, they were on holiday.  On holiday?  Yeah.  Probably thinking they were being private somewhere.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  And the girls over there, it's all about being topless, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean...  They're not all bent out of shape like they are in America.  Yeah, but they were also, like, you know, in a private place.  Like, they're not going to, you know, hang out with the locals. 
[01:01:30]  Sure.  They had, as we were saying in America, a reasonable expectation of privacy.  Oh.  Which is very important when you take photos.  Like, if I photograph...  If you're out behind a tree and you're jerking off and I photograph you, that's not a reasonable expectation of privacy.  But if you're in your living room and your window's open and you walk by and I take a picture, I think that is an invasion of privacy.  Right.  Because you have that reasonable...  I just said it three times.  I don't think she can sue for that, though.  I don't think there's a reasonable expectation of privacy outside.  Well, it depends on her.  But I think they were, like, in a very private resort area. 
[01:02:00]  I don't know if they have it or not.  Plus, Italian law might be different.  Not so private if a lensman was able to get...  Lensman, yes.  None of the British tabloids are posting the photos.  They're scared shitless.  Why is that?  Especially after the Harry photos from, like, a couple weeks ago.  Why aren't they, though?  Those scumbags go after everybody.  Why are they protecting the royal family unless it's illegal?  They're not protecting.  They're scared shitless of the royal family.  Oh, man.  There's a difference.  They know the royal family will sue, you know?  Yeah, they're scared.  And they're saying, you know, like, it's a breach of privacy and, you know, we shouldn't 
[01:02:30]  do that to the royal family.  Blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, she's not right.  Scumbags.  I hate the British press.  They're always...  Look at her pulling her baby suit down so he could oil up her...  Look at her rump!  Oil up her rump.  Oiling up that ass of hers.  You know how damn well that guy doesn't know what to do with that.  Dude, that cameraman must have been out of his mind.  Prince William.  Prince William.  Prince William just seems like his dad.  He's a duller.  Harry seems a little crazy.  Harry's...  He's out of his mind.  Yeah.  And the reason is because he has a different father. 
[01:03:00]  We all know that.  I would...  It's not official, but...  It's not official, but man...  You look at...  William and Harry look totally different.  Of course.  I think he also knows that, like, he's not going to be king, so, like, who gives a fuck?  Like, you know...  Yeah, he doesn't care.  Yeah.  Fucking Nazi uniform at a Halloween party.  Totally naked, humping some chick in Vegas.  Guy rules.  He does rule.  That's what you want to be, kid.  Flies a fucking attack helicopter.  Right.  Crazy guy.  He just went back.  Yeah, yeah.  Of course he has a different father. 
[01:03:30]  Come on.  Can you imagine...  Why can't they just tell us?  Being the photographer, how much...  Yeah, okay.  I have Kate Middleton's tits and asshole in my fucking sight.  Like, what a great day for a photographer.  It's probably why it's fuzzy.  It was probably shaking.  You know, holy shit.  This is huge.  She's a young bra.  Those boobs are...  Those are nice, dude.  Ah, there's a little hurt there.  Come on.  For her age?  That front shot doesn't look good, but I think it's shadowing.  Yeah.  You think?  I think for the side view, they look pretty goddamn good.  Yeah.  How about the ass stuff?  Oh, dude, look at it.  She's...  Like, it's...  I love when the ass eats the thong. 
[01:04:00]  When a girl says, like, my ass is eating the thong, that means it disappears between the  cheeks.  And look at her pulling it down out of the crack.  Yeah.  How fucking hot is that?  And then this idiot doesn't even know what he's looking at.  Let me...  Is he lotioning her ass?  Let me lotion your ass up a little bit here.  Yes, yes, yes.  Then I'll apply it to his head.  Yeah, slide a digit in there if you don't mind.  Oh, blimey.  Yes, yes.  It's much like us going into another country.  What a bore.  You're right.  Prince Harry knows he's not going to be king because you've still got to wait for the  Queen Elizabeth to die. 
[01:04:30]  Then the Charles gets in there for the little...  He's not even going to go.  I think he's being passed over.  They're going to pass him over after all these years?  Yeah, he's too old.  I was passed over!  Yeah, he's afraid of.  He's afraid of.  Your whole life is waiting for the day, and now they've decided, now you're too old,  so we're going to go with your son?  They'll go straight to William, yeah.  Your duty is to the realm.  Is he okay with that, you think?  Who, Charles?  Yeah.  Yeah, probably.  He didn't care.  I don't think he's okay with that.  He doesn't need it.  He's waiting his whole life to be the king.  He's Prince Charles.  It doesn't matter.  Yeah.  He can't get any more powerful than he is, and he can't get any more famous than he 
[01:05:00]  is.  I think you want that king title.  Well, his son will have it.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  What a fucking...  What a charmed life.  What an asshole move.  Yeah, charmed life.  But you know what sucks about that?  What if you're just this young little Prince Charles, and you're like, you know what?  I want to go in a stand-up.  You're not allowed to do anything else.  Poor guy.  Yeah, you can't.  Well, granted, it's a nice life, but...  You're right, though.  I wonder if that bothers some of these guys.  Well, I think that's what, like, Harry was getting tired of, you know, all the protection 
[01:05:30]  when he went into the army.  He's like, I just want to be in the army.  I want to go fight, you know?  And they had a big problem with that.  And they tried to...  Didn't they try to whack him this fucking week, last week?  No, they wanted to.  With the Afghans?  I think they did.  Yeah, they killed one of his guards or something?  Maybe.  Yeah, they wanted to.  They were dressed like American soldiers, and...  Really?  Yeah.  They didn't get too close.  They would love to kill him.  Oh, shit up.  Oh, he's being passed over because of the divorce.  Really?  Some are saying.  Really?  Some are saying.  I don't know about that. 
[01:06:00]  Meaning Justin Townsend from New Jersey.  Oh, okay.  Justin knows.  Tribes.  Edgar.  God damn it.  Did your team win this weekend, Travis?  No, they lost to Philly.  Oh, they played the Eagles, right?  Yeah.  How was Michael Vick?  I heard he was...  He was better.  He's a weird quarterback.  Yeah.  He scored the winning touchdown, so good for him.  Oh.  He's a strange quarterback, too, man.  24-23.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Dang.  I know already.  You don't have to show me.  I wasn't showing you.  It's not for you.  It's for Jim. 
[01:06:30]  Jim wants to see things.  Michael Vick rallied late?  Yeah.  Yeah, last touchdown was a minute 55.  Damn.  And then they couldn't come back.  And then the Broncos with Peyton Manning, they play tonight, right?  That's tonight.  Yep.  What happened?  Oh.  Aw.  So why don't you just get one?  You always look up when you see a puppy on TV.  I love a little puppy.  Because it would end up dead like the little baby in Trainspotting, and you know it.  I have no responsibility for a dog.  You would take care of your dog.  You'd probably be good with a dog.  No, I don't want to walk a dog. 
[01:07:00]  Let him go duty in the yard and get someone to clean it.  No.  Because someone has to let the dog out.  Yes, that's true, too.  You wouldn't even let the dog out?  I'd be on the couch going, fuck it.  Figure out how to open the door yourself.  There would be a room in the house that would be the dog room, and then that's where the  dog would live and sleep and shit and eat and everything.  A week would go by, and you'd be like, didn't I have a dog?  I thought I had a dog.  No, I can't.  And I just, I like leaving.  Sometimes I stay in the city, I stay in the apartment for like a night, and then it turns  into three nights, because I just don't fucking have any...  You would take a 40-pound bag of dog food and just rip it open, and just pour it in the 
[01:07:30]  middle of a room, and be like, well, now I'm good for it.  Yeah, I would.  That's sad.  Well, no, it's good.  I like that.  I like my lifestyle like that.  Well, at least you know you can't take care of a dog.  Other assholes think they can.  I could probably have a cat.  I could probably work a cat.  Sure, because they're independent.  Yeah, a cat's just fucking...  But, you know, then you've got to have a cat.  You're right.  You do have to think of a lot of things when you have a dog.  By the way, everyone's saying that Charles isn't being passed over.  Where do you get your info? 
[01:08:00]  He's going to be passed over.  Everyone's saying that there's no reason to pass him over.  He's too old.  They won't.  They won't put him in.  Well, then he said, well, that's the way mom wanted it.  And he goes, that ain't the way I wanted it.  Oh, send Charles to the airport to pick up the king of Turkey.  He's all slouched in a throne.  Yeah.  Oh, did he just look weak in that scene?  It was the greatest seat ever for a fucking defeated scene.  Yes.  He's just, like, almost reclining.  He's just collapsed.  Yeah, yeah.  Why is Donald Trump talking about... 
[01:08:30]  Hold on one sec.  This might be good.  How could you do his thing so stupid?  Yeah, especially given the fact...  And we don't know where these particular photos were taken, but what was it, two weeks ago in Vegas where you got Prince Harry and there he is naked?  Well, the Harry thing, I mean, you know, you could almost say he was less, except his security did a pretty bad job.  But to be outside at a swimming pool without a top on and your Kate, you know, maybe they can stop it.  Maybe they can stop it.  But it is a very, very foolish thing she did. 
[01:09:00]  So only people without money and fame should take their tops off?  Is that what you say?  Well, maybe that's correct.  Keep your clothes on, Donald.  That would be a big picture somewhere.  I think we have to look at it that way.  From a paparazzi and tabloid, too, should the U.S. stop foreign aid to countries like Egypt over these embassy attacks?  We all remember last week, the president of the United States, he wasn't sure if Egypt was an ally or an enemy.  And that brings into question, well, then, should we continue to give them $1.6 billion a year?  What do you think, Donald?  Well, I don't even think it should be a question. 
[01:09:30]  It seems like so obvious.  But it is.  And they treat us terribly.  They're now taking over.  You know, it was a different thing when Mubarak, but Mubarak, we ran him out of power.  But when he was running things, at least you could talk to Egypt.  Now, all of a sudden, they become the big enemy.  They're run by the Muslim Brotherhood.  Should not even be, you shouldn't even be asking this question.  The answer is absolutely not.  And you know what?  If we didn't pay, they'd be coming back to us begging for the money because they desperately need it.  Donald, I was amazed over the weekend that people were, actually, over the last week, 
[01:10:00]  were focused on when Mitt Romney should be critical of the communications on the State Department  during the Egyptian attacks, and not over the fact that it's been 20 attacks in 20 different countries against us,  not over the fact that President Obama was going to Nevada the day after our ambassador was murdered.  They were focusing on Mitt Romney.  I've never seen such imbalance.  It's incredible.  And, you know, it's really, we have to do something, and the Republicans have to do something.  And, honestly, Mitt has to do something. 
[01:10:30]  Any statement he makes, they attack him.  How dare you make this statement?  We're in the middle of a conflict.  How dare you make it?  It doesn't matter.  If he would have made the statement 10 hours later, they would have said the same thing.  And then everybody says, oh, wasn't it terrible that he made a statement?  The statement he made was totally fine.  There was nothing wrong with the statement he made.  And they're trying to always put you on the defensive.  If you say anything bad about Obama, they put you on the defensive.  How can you say this about this president?  Are you a racist?  It's a horrible thing.  It's terrible. 
[01:11:00]  I mean, what's going on is terrible.  And, you know, I just sort of thought of this over the last, and watching your show over the last little while.  We have an unlucky president.  He's been unlucky for this country.  Everything he touches turns to trouble.  And I was going to use the worst word, but I refused to use that word.  Oh, no.  But everything he touches turns to trouble.  They talk about his foreign policy.  His foreign policy is a disaster.  The Middle East is exploding with all the billions and trillions. 
[01:11:30]  Not billions.  Trillions we've spent there.  It's exploding.  Our economy stinks.  How is he blaming him?  He's an unlucky president.  Like, I don't think he's blaming him.  You've got to love it.  To say his foreign policy is a disaster.  He's got a few things done.  Iraq and Afghanistan were not part of his foreign policy.  And in Egypt, that would have seemed like it was a good thing, quote-unquote democracy.  There was almost, quote-unquote democracy in Iran.  Gaddafi was overthrown.  And now there's rebellions in Syria. 
[01:12:00]  For how good that was.  But I'm saying it looked like these would all be good things for the U.S., quote-unquote democracy.  The problem is when you give somebody like that democracy or when they take democracy, the Muslim Brotherhood takes over.  Let them have it.  That's their business.  But there is this overwhelming feeling that America is, again, weak.  It's got this Carter administration feel to how the world views the United States right now.  As weak, no matter how many drone strikes Obama throws at people, which, again, I do know it's more generals and military people. 
[01:12:30]  Just saying, hey, you know, we know where this guy is.  But, yeah, he gets credit for it.  Credit where credit's true.  But the truth of the matter is we got this kind of, we can be stepped on right now.  We got this feeling that we can be stepped on just like this.  Embassy's burning.  And, you know, what's going on?  But 9-11 happened.  And I do not at all blame. 
[01:13:00]  That's just something I've been trying to keep under my hat, but I'll talk about it now.  How the hell did this happen?  Why wasn't I told?  But I don't believe it was any party's fault at all.  But we had a very feared arch-conservative in office when that happened.  It wasn't some fucking fruity, bleeding heart.  It was as much of a military conservative, I think, as the world would see as a military conservative.  He was just in, though, really.  Still, he was there.  Think about it.  And they did it.  They did it, too.  It didn't happen on Obama's watch.  And I'm not saying, again, I don't blame Bush for that, but you know what I mean. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, but it was more, I'm not blaming Clinton for it either, but it was more his, the whole plan was developed during the Clinton administration where, you know, you had, again, another, you know, something happened in Somalia, and he pulls all the guys out.  It wasn't really known as a powerhouse time for our country's strength and respect in the world.  You know?  That's true. 
[01:14:00]  I don't know.  So I think Hope's right with this whole thing.  We're looking at what's going to end the world.  We are looking at the little things that are going to end the world at some point.  That's a biggie.  I mean, the two cultures will never get along.  That's obvious.  Yeah.  And I just love the point, I'll say it again, that Scarborough made.  You get these dumb presidents, every single one.  They think they're going to change their mind.  It's like, I got the formula.  My solution's going to work.  I'm going to kill them with kindness this time.  We're going to listen to them. 
[01:14:30]  We're going to share in their outrage in certain things.  It's the lack of respect for their religious beliefs.  We're going to sympathize with that.  And that's going to make them like us.  Nope.  No.  None of that shit in the end will make them like us.  God damn.  Fundamentally, they're extremely different.  They just don't like our way of life.  And their way of life dictates that our way of life not only has to not be tolerated,  but has to really be destroyed and wiped out. 
[01:15:00]  That's what their religion tells them.  Does it become a huge war between the two religions eventually?  That would be great.  An all-out war?  I hope so.  I hope I see it.  Please.  Please.  Please, God.  Strike your wrath on their false god.  God, could you do that, please?  Thank you, Jesus Christ, the only real Lord. 
[01:15:30]  Religion again.  It's killed way more people than anything else.  There's a great special on HBO On Demand.  It's a documentary about...  Do you remember in Jordan a few years ago, a suicide bombing took out a wedding?  No, of course.  It's the groom who survived.  The bride survived.  I think both of her parents were killed and his mother was killed.  So this guy is going out and he's sick of it.  He's had enough of the suicide bombing because he's Muslim and he's just tired of it.  So he's meeting with other... 
[01:16:00]  He met with the father of a...  Not of that bomber, but of a bomber from Jordan who bombed and killed 125 people in Iraq.  And then you start to feel bad for a lot of these families, too, because even the families of the bombers are in denial.  He's like, he was a normal kid.  Like, he's like, he never talked politics.  Like, they don't see it coming.  They believe when the young 25-year-old male says he's going off to study somewhere.  They don't know he's going to...  Like, the father is genuinely in shock that he can't get over the fact that his kid did this. 
[01:16:30]  And they interview...  I don't know how they got this guy on tape, but they interview the guy who is like the...  He was one of the...  I don't know if he was the weapons expert, but he was the guy that recruited both of those bombers for Al-Qaeda in Jordan.  And he wouldn't meet with the family, of course.  Of course.  But it's a very, very good documentary.  I gotta check that out.  HBO, I forget what it's called.  I wish I could remember, because that would help a lot.  HBO does have some good ones.  Fucking great ones, man.  Really cool. 
[01:17:00]  I've been watching the Paradise Lost ones again, just because we have Damien Eccles on Wednesday.  That's cool.  Whose book, and I'll say this, it's one of the best books I've ever read.  Wow.  It's a lot of what he wrote.  What makes it so good?  It's not just the case revisited, because we've all seen the documentaries.  We've all talked about the case ad nauseum.  It's his writings in prison, and he mixes it in with stories from before, and then all  of a sudden he's talking about the case, and about being in jail, and the trial, then he's  back to his teenage years, and it's fucking fascinating. 
[01:17:30]  Like, I can't believe what a great writer this guy is.  It's one of the best books I've ever read.  How many years did he do?  18 years.  Well, when you have some time on your hands.  But it's like, a lot of these times, these guys, you know, for him it worked out where  he was a great writer.  Yeah.  But it's fascinating, his life, and it's like, he says he doesn't want people just to view  him as a freak, like, alright, here's the guy that was, and it's, you're like, alright,  yeah, whatever.  But then you read it, and you're like, you're just reading it as like, he's a great writer.  Like, I know what he's there for, and why he's writing. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, yeah.  When did he get out?  2010, I think, right?  Danny, do you know?  Yeah, it was just a couple years ago.  It was very recently.  A couple years ago.  How's the other guy doing?  There's three of them.  Jason Miskelley, we interviewed Jason.  Yeah, how's he doing, you think?  I think they have some kind of a rift now over a movie being made.  I would love to ask them about that.  Oh, really?  Really.  Yeah, there's something to do with a film that's being made that they're not, like, I think  Damien's unhappy with, uh, Jason.  Jason Baldwin.  Baldwin, yeah.  Who's the guy we talked to.  He was released last August, so that was one year. 
[01:18:30]  And Jason, and Jesse Miskelley, who's the guy who confessed.  Yeah.  Who I just really am annoyed at.  He said he's not mad at, but he's borderline.  He has an IQ of 72.  Yeah, he's fucking, like, like rich.  Like, yeah, he's like, picture, yeah, picture Voss if he had a southern accent.  But it's hard to imagine, like, when I, I'm watching, re-watching the documentary, the  original.  I'm going to watch all three.  And it's like, all of a sudden I realize why the public at least thought that they did  it at first, because, you know, you hear in the victim, they focus a lot on the victim's 
[01:19:00]  families.  Which I respect the documentary makers for doing that.  They don't just leave them as background noise.  They talk to the parents.  They focus on these murdered kids.  And it's fucking heartbreaking.  I was crying watching it.  It was fucking terrible.  Fucking pissy-eyed.  Oh, it was awful.  Jesus Christ.  He had a little self-respect.  That was the original intent of the documentary, was just to document the trial.  Trial.  They didn't think that they were going to go down there and find, you know, that these  guys may be innocent.  Were railroaded.  Right, right, right.  Yeah. 
[01:19:30]  So I'm watching it and, you know, it's so fucking interesting to see how initially you  start to think.  And the original defense witness for Jason Miskell, they were tried separately, said that  he goes, it's hard for anybody to imagine why a person would falsely confess.  And I never believe false confessions.  I'm like, get the fuck out of here.  But when you see this guy and the way he acts during the trial with his dumb head down.  And Damien even talks in his book about how he was slow.  And you knew he was slow. 
[01:20:00]  And he has an IQ of 72 and they just, with the interrogation techniques, I guess on somebody  with that IQ, you really can be manipulated into giving a false confession.  And the expert said it's because you just want the immediate problem to be solved, which  is get these guys away from me.  You just want to go home.  You'll say anything to get them away from you.  It's almost like when you're caught in a lie with your chick.  Or an argument where you say, all right, all right, I'll apologize even though I'm not  sorry, just to shut her the fuck up.  Right.  Well, we're not knowing that it's going to lead to a fucking life in prison. 
[01:20:30]  Not understanding.  Yeah.  Summy.  The consequences of it.  His book is fucking, Travis told me it was good and I saw, I really dove into it and  it's fucking one of the best books I've ever read.  And he's in Wednesday?  He's in Wednesday.  Yeah.  I cannot wait to talk to him about this.  Yeah, he'll talk about the thing with Jason about there's a Hollywood movie being made  about a book, Devil's Knot, which was written years ago about the case.  And he doesn't support it because they're not, you know, he's being portrayed as the 
[01:21:00]  ringleader, you know, which is what he was portrayed as in real life.  And he doesn't think that it's going to be a good thing.  Yeah, I don't blame him.  I mean, he was the one they gave death to.  Oh, yeah.  He was, would you see, you've never seen a guy more fucked by the system than Damien  Echols.  Holy shit, yes.  Like, even before this happened, like, before he, and again, we'll talk about what he's  saying, but before this whole thing happened, he had spent months in a psychiatric place  because literally some truant officer thought that he belonged there because him and his 
[01:21:30]  girlfriend tried to run away together.  Like, he was.  He didn't have a good upbringing.  Dude.  He didn't have a good life.  Dirt poor, so fucked.  Could you see if he comes in and there's a stipulation, you can only talk about his hat  store that he wants to open.  Nothing about West Memphis 3.  Nothing at all.  Just what type of hats he enjoys.  Yeah.  He only wants to talk about the book.  It's a book on footwear.  Laurie Davis is coming with him, too. 
[01:22:00]  His wife.  Oh, okay.  Nice.  That's going to be a good day.  Yeah.  Cool.  So, so far, I'm tremendously enjoying, and I can't wait to go through all three documents.  I'm like halfway through the first one.  That was long, right?  Yeah, the first one's very long.  It's a long one.  Really cool, though.  I mean, fucking just amazing shit.  It's an amazing story.  When you realize in hindsight that that was made before, you know, this kind of movie ending  to the whole thing happens, because that was just, here's what happened, here's where  they are, and here's where the families are.  You didn't think like, wait a minute, are we going to get out? 
[01:22:30]  They didn't do it?  That's like a movie fucking ending, and a lot of people still think they did it.  There are people that think they did it, but I've become pretty convinced that they  didn't, and again, when you read his book, it makes a lot of sense, the type of guy he  was, and he talks about, yeah, just being different and growing up and trying to be  this and that, and he talks about certain things that were misinterpreted, like when  he told his father, I'll eat you, like what that argument was about and what was happening,  and the way the sheriff was obsessed with his Satanism, and he's like, what Satanism? 
[01:23:00]  He's like, I wore an Iron Maiden shirt to a youth group meeting, and it's like, he didn't  help his cause either during the trial, like he was very smug and very, you know, like there's  no way they're going to convict me on this, you know, so I'm just going to be, you know,  a punk kid.  Yeah.  Well, they were all terrible, like when I'm watching Miss Kelly leave during this part,  after his conviction, he got life plus 40, and I'm watching him leave, and they're  like, did you do it?  Do you have a statement to make to the judge?  He just says, no, and I'm like, they just gave you life, how do you not make a statement  to the fucking judge?  I didn't do this. 
[01:23:30]  I don't understand, as men, the way they handled this, but again, they were teenagers taking  the advice of shit lawyers, and Echols raised a good point in his book, he goes, this is  a public defender, he goes, I would ask certain, like, why weren't certain things challenged?  And he goes, because we need this judge, we don't want him to piss him off too much, and  he goes, these are guys that take their paycheck from the courts.  Yeah.  Um, he does not sound like a paranoid guy trying to rewrite history.  What he says sounds very logical, and when watching the documentaries, a lot of the things 
[01:24:00]  that have come out, I, it just, it kind of makes sense to me that these guys got fucked,  and I'm not on the Hollywood bandwagon, like, well, you know, it's the hip cause, I really  believe, because I think at first I thought they did it.  Yeah.  And even after I believed.  Oh, yeah, I was like, oh, they're so guilty.  Yeah.  Because there's so much focus on the children in the first one, and the agony of the families,  and, like, the one religious father who seems like a lunatic, but he's just terribly grieving  his stepson, you know, when he's shooting pumpkins.  John Mark Byers. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, I love that guy.  John Mark Byers is fucking crazy.  And he's talking to the pumpkin with the other father, and they're like, you know, for torturing  my baby, and he's firing, and you're like, this real fucking rage these guys have.  And they just start thinking he did it, and it's amazing what a documentary can do, though,  because they can present certain things in, like, oh, that guy definitely did it, and  then in the third one, you're like, oh, no, he didn't do it, but that guy is so fucking  guilty.  Yeah.  He's doing a book signing on Friday with Johnny Depp.  Where?  Union Square.  Barnes and Noble. 
[01:25:00]  Wow, goddammit, I'll be gone.  I'll be in, uh, Columbus.  Shit.  Columbus.  Hmm.  Fuck.  Let's get Johnny Depp on.  Wow.  I'd love to get that.  Yeah, that'll happen.  Hi, you want Johnny Depp?  He was a big supporter for a long time.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's say he's going around, you know, helping Daniel.  Why does he come in then on Wednesday?  Yeah, let's do this, Johnny.  Yo, Johnny, let's do this.  If you want Johnny Depp, I can make the cousin.  What?  What?  Yeah, Tim Burton's cousin first.  Tim Burton's cousin first.  You guys take him first. 
[01:25:30]  He was a supporter for a long time.  They got the same tattoos, I guess, like as a sign of whatever, but it worked out for  Depp this time.  But he's been a supporter for a long time.  Nice.  All right.  Yeah, that's not kind of the cause du jour that went away.  Like, hey, where's Coney, by the way?  That always makes it.  Anytime anyone brings up.  Slacktivism.  Man, I'm just like, yeah, slacktivism.  I tweeted it.  You know, we're trying real hard here.  Oh, really?  With 140 characters?  It's like Occupy is kicking back up now because it's the one year anniversary. 
[01:26:00]  It's not kicking up.  Well, it's getting some news anyway.  Okay, all right.  I guess there were like a couple hundred people in the park.  Well, we got...  And today there's supposed to be a big thing down by Wall Street.  No one cares.  Go the fuck home, you smelly bastards.  We got the clip.  Oh, good.  We are 99%!  That's the chant heard around the world as Occupy Wall Street protests hit a crescendo last fall. 
[01:26:30]  It's been a year since protesters in New York City targeted corporate greed and rallied thousands of disenfranchised people.  You know, that was only...  I was talking to Danny about this before the show because he said it's the year anniversary.  They were only in Zuccotti Park for about two and a half months.  That's it?  Yeah.  Really?  Didn't it seem longer?  Yeah.  It certainly did.  Because it was in other places.  Before then?  Yeah.  No, no.  After, too.  Remember?  Even after they were out of Zuccotti Park, we still talked about for a month or two after. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, the Zuccotti.  In the warmer.  Remember that?  Yeah.  My mother made Zuccotti melt your heart.  Oh, melts in your mouth.  Fell apart here because it just got cold.  But then they were like, you know, Occupy San Francisco.  I missed Zuccotti Park.  It was fun to go down there and check it all out.  It was a three-ring circus down there.  And I heard what they want to really do this time around is educate.  Educate people on how you can use your street demonstrations to change the world.  Oh, that's nice. 
[01:27:30]  Good luck.  And rallied thousands of disenfranchised people.  So where is the movement today?  Now, if you are being detained.  In New York City, where Occupy was born, it's now a shadow of its former self.  We have a structure that is built on smaller groups where one-to-one communication is possible.  So what happened to the momentum that Occupy built up last fall?  Ex-occupiers say what was started as a protest against income inequality devolved into a protest  against everything wrong with the world.  I think that we were there to occupy Wall Street. 
[01:28:00]  That's right.  Not to talk about every social ill that we have.  Many say the death of Occupy came last fall when New York and other cities started violently  removing them from the streets they were occupying.  I think Occupy was devastated by the evictions all over the country.  After the evictions, Occupy is at no place to go.  And many became disillusioned.  I started to really burn out and I just started seeing the cacophony of, you know, people arguing and arguing. 
[01:28:30]  Ex-occupiers say the reason the momentum of the movement slowed was it grew too big too fast.  We got to a kind of a critical mass where our GA, our General Assembly, no longer functioned.  Many Occupiers say the movement has had to reorganize and become more focused,  thanks in part to the experiences of last year.  After a while, we decided that we needed to really disband the General Assembly and all of our structures and start anew. 
[01:29:00]  Occupy members say they will mark the one-year anniversary with various forms of civil disobedience around Wall Street  and they'll meet at a local park to discuss their plans for the future of the movement.  And speaking of the Wall Street, it's going down right now.  They're sitting down at Wall Street.  There's 20 people behind a barricade.  Yeah, that's it.  Hey, look, all the management is there.  Ah, horse's ass.  Police horse from the back. 
[01:29:30]  Ah, that's a good one.  That was funny.  I thought they were live streaming, no?  That was just, oh, this might be it.  They're actually live streaming it on the internet right now.  Oh, there we go.  What are they saying?  I don't know, but the point of this is that they're trying to disrupt traffic.  I just saw a bus go down the block pretty easily.  Yeah, because the cops keep them off the street.  Good.  You're not for the men's?  Oh, I hate them. 
[01:30:00]  I hate them.  With their phony fucking enthusiasm.  You think they just spoiled fucking suburban kids?  Yes.  You don't like when people take on the system?  Man, you know what?  I'd have more respect if they started picking rocks up and throwing them, or started fucking  throwing Molotov cocktails, and didn't claim that if they get pushed too hard onto the sidewalk,  that it's police brutality.  There's two of them sitting.  You're not changing the world crying that one of your friends was arrested with nice comfy 
[01:30:30]  zip strips around their hands.  Shut up.  People that really make change in this world by demonstrations, it's usually because a lot  of blood is spilled.  Well, we got a scene right now.  Two dummies just sitting on the sidewalk.  A million photogs.  Cameramen filming right now.  We got the NYPD in the white shirts talking to them.  I love them to start clubbing these douchebags.  P-U-T-R-E-L-L. 
[01:31:00]  They're always like, what's your badge number?  Like, here.  Here it is.  Shut up.  I was watching a news report, and they said, well, what are you guys doing down there today?  What's the purpose of this?  And somebody was like, well, you know, we're going to go and clog the streets of downtown  Wall Street and make it really difficult for all the bankers to blah, blah, blah.  And so the reporter actually had a great question.  They were like, well, you know, there's a lot of working joes downtown also that have  to pay, you know, their rent, and it's going to be difficult for them as well.  Oh, here they go.  Yeah.  Well, they'll have to figure out a way. 
[01:31:30]  They can handle it for half a day.  They'll get to work for the other three.  But so will these guys.  So will the bankers.  No one's going to give a fuck about this.  The riot guys have come in, and they're just dragging them off easily.  Yeah.  Believe me, the fucking way to make a stand.  Stocks will trade today.  Yeah.  Whatever happened with that Apple?  Did it go up more?  I sold it.  No.  No, they're going bankrupt because of the Occupy efforts.  Yes.  No, I mean, it was in on that whole thing on Friday.  It went back down.  It did.  So you made the right move? 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  It was up to about 12.  People liked their updates.  It made.  So you more or less sold on the high?  Yeah.  Well, not on that high, because when I was sitting there at one point, it was pretty high.  Right.  And then I dumped out at a good time.  And now I can see what I do this week.  I see what I do.  Look at all these thousand dollar cameras.  Yeah, I know.  All these fucking, most of them are just spoiled suburban kids.  They want to be part of something that they feel is important.  They feel guilty about their privilege, and they feel guilty about the ease of their lives. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  And they want to do what they, because they feel like they're valueless and they have no meaning,  so they want to do what they think is meaningful.  And they think they're being like leaders.  I like, every one of these people have a, well, I'm here to show the world that, fuck  you.  Well, most of them just want a story to tell.  Yeah.  Yes.  Their lives are not that interesting, because again, most of them, not all of them, are  children of privilege.  Yeah.  And that's not that interesting to hear about.  However, I was down at Occupy.  Yeah.  It's a story to tell. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  So what have you been up to?  Well, you know, I'm really, I'm involved with the, might have heard, the Occupy Wall Street  mode.  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  Tell me more.  Yeah, I'm down there every day.  You know, we're just trying to educate the people.  Fuck you.  Shut up.  Instead of saying, I took a cruise with my parents, or I was summering with my parents.  Right.  Yes.  Which all of them probably could do.  Yeah.  They'd rather, you know.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm down in the trenches, really.  I'm a warrior for, like, social consciousness.  Fuck off.  So, I, so what, the next day or two, there'll be some things going on, and then it'll just 
[01:33:30]  fade away again.  Yeah.  Yeah, then it'll just, they don't have a central location to, I like how they try to kick it  back up before this winter.  Like, they never, what are they doing in the summer?  They are vacationing.  Who wants to spend a hot summer?  Backpacking in Europe?  Yes.  Who wants to spend a hot summer walking around the streets of Manhattan when you could be  vacationing somewhere?  Or on that cruise with your parents or something.  Right.  It's so full of shit.  Why wouldn't they be here in June? 
[01:34:00]  Well, they would, well, they would say they're marking the year anniversary, though.  Yeah.  Wow, so people have to wait one year?  What's the anniversary?  It should mean nothing.  If you're, if you're, if your movement is sincere and based in real desire to change,  then the date of an anniversary should be irrelevant to you.  Mm-hmm.  Right.  That's what they would tell you, though.  A bunch of fucking douchebags.  They need to stir that pot up again.  Yeah.  Time to recapture some magic.  Yeah.  When we get back, we're going to have some radio magic for everybody.  Oh? 
[01:34:30]  Radio wizardry?  Ooh.  I want to know what E-Rock did over the weekend.  Oh.  Was it fun?  I don't know.  Oh, good.  What, E-Rock?  What's wrong with that?  Nothing.  I just, I didn't do much.  No, no, not since you've been here today.  He means over the weekend.  Fair enough.  Well, we could do it before the break.  Fair enough, sorry.  What did E-Rock do for the weekend?  Not a whole hell of a lot.  You're a home buddy.  What'd you do?  Yeah.  I love my house. 
[01:35:00]  What'd you do at the house?  I, uh...  You know, E-Rock sits around the house.  He sits around the house.  Exactly.  No respect.  No cartoons, definitely.  No, no cartoons.  Legos?  Video games.  Video games.  I haven't played in a long time.  Which video games?  Oh, were you playing Red Dead with people online?  Yes, I was.  Oh, yeah.  I saw you tweet that.  Hey, if you're not watching football, was that your tweet?  Surprised.  There was a lot of people that joined.  Really?  Yeah.  We had a full server.  Ooh.  Nerd talk. 
[01:35:30]  I don't know what that means.  Thank God.  What?  Having a full server?  I have no idea.  That's what you get in a restaurant.  Yeah.  That's a fat waiter.  That, and we watched some football.  Who's your team?  Giants?  I married into the Giants.  So who was your team before that?  So did she.  Oh, E-Rock.  Who was your team before you became a Giants fan?  I never cared.  My family were Jets fans growing up, but I never cared. 
[01:36:00]  You were born and raised in Florida, so Long Island.  No, Florida.  We've seen the picture of you taking your speedboat to high school.  Yeah, I was 22 in that photo.  Oh.  Pretty cool, huh?  Yeah.  You didn't have a team at all?  It was a great boat.  No, I never cared about football.  And I liked the Mets up to a certain point and then give up on that, too.  Fair weather fan?  Well, when they had the strike in 94, I just said I was fucking done. 
[01:36:30]  Oh.  I'm a terrible weather fan.  Yeah.  Boy, those guys never clear up.  No.  Are you still a Mets fan, Danny?  I mean, call it what you will.  I mean, define fan.  Like, what does that mean anymore?  Like, when your team just sucks for so long?  Like, I'm not going to switch to the Yankees.  I'm not going to be like, hey, let's get Yankees tickets.  I will still go to a Mets game, but I don't know if I could even call myself a fan.  Like, what am I a fan of anymore?  But you're a true sports fan.  Because you don't jump ship.  Nah, you can't.  Because the Yankees.  You just wait it out and hope that they can turn it around. 
[01:37:00]  Maybe I would be that guy if I lived somewhere else, but I was able to see Shea Stadium out  of my fucking window growing up.  I can't turn my back on that.  Like, how do you do that?  Why not just jump teams?  Nah, you can't jump teams.  You just enjoy them.  You can't jump teams.  Why not?  Just enjoy the Red Sox.  I will always argue this point.  You can't jump teams.  Sure you can.  It's whoever's doing good.  You want to keep playing?  It's my game.  All my friends growing up, you know, no one wanted to like the Mets.  That was, you know, that was faggotty.  You know, Yankees, they were the Dominators.  And like, oh, yeah, kids that grew up in my building. 
[01:37:30]  It's just like, what a fucking asshole you are.  Are you going to go to the Yankees parade tomorrow?  Because what?  Because you love them so much.  You used to go all the time.  You live in Flushing, you fucking asshole.  This should never be.  I was a sports fan my whole life.  Loyalty to teams.  It's stupid.  It's fucking nonsense.  Because none of these cocksuckers would step over my fucking body.  So it's like, fuck them.  Fuck all of them.  You're right.  No, I mean, and I'm not like a fanatic like that.  Because I honestly, I just don't really give a fuck. 
[01:38:00]  But when you're that close to a team, like how do you, in New York is, you know, you kind  of have to pick a side because there's two different New York teams.  Like it's one or the other.  It's not like we could all agree, oh, it's the New York New Yorkers and everybody's happy.  It's, you know, you got, there's a line in the sand.  So how do you pick?  We used to look out your window and flushing at the stadium together.  Remember me and you?  Now that you're bringing it up?  Now I remember.  In the ball club, I'd be like, come here, let me pick you up.  I'll take you there someday.  You'd push your little rump back while I was holding you with your little face up against 
[01:38:30]  the screen.  Didn't you get me one of those mini bats at the stadium?  Yeah, I brought one with me and I'd say, hey, it's the mini bat.  Look at that.  It's got like a little bit of, got like a little bit of juicy candy on the tip.  Get it on, spank your bottom with the mini bat.  You said that was chocolate ice cream.  No, it was just a little bit of clear candy.  Yay.  Clear candy.  Have some sugary candy.  Clear candy.  And you said that little skin shell thing, you said that was just from the Cracker Jack popcorn. 
[01:39:00]  No, I would always rub that between your upper lip and your gums.  You remember I'd do that?  I'd rub the little bat between your upper lip and your gums.  I don't like going to the ball game anymore.  I wouldn't either.  I would Uncle Paul.  Yeah, I'd slide your PJs down and tickle your feet.  I don't care if I ever come back.  Yeah.  Remember I would touch your bottom and we would sing the Meet the Mets song.  Jesus.  Slide my finger down back by your thighs. 
[01:39:30]  By my dugout.  Yeah, you'd be so confused.  Where are the Yankees at these days?  Why am I going along with the North Station?  Because you remember.  Because you remember.  Your little feety part of your pajamas would make that shuka shuka shuka sound like you was shook.  Did I get a jersey after the game?  No.  He was a very bad boy.  I gave you some Jesus juice.  You'd fall asleep.  Tell your mother you was bad.  When is baseball over? 
[01:40:00]  I don't know.  You know.  It's end of the month.  You know, Mr. October and that shit.  Yeah, I know.  We've got to still do the October thing.  We've got to October it.  Yankees hanging in there?  Yeah, you know.  Yankees are game ahead of the surprising and fantastic Baltimore Orioles.  Yeah.  Travis.  Remember I took you to Camden Yards when you was a baby?  Yeah, I do.  Sure.  Sure.  I drove by.  You sat in my lap.  We looked at them building the new Camden Yards.  Like, Uncle Paul, will you take me? 
[01:40:30]  I'm like, sure.  Kiss the magic eel.  Remember that little Travis?  I was 10.  Yeah.  You're an old boy.  Well, it only opened 20 years ago.  I dropped your mother off at the temple.  And then me and you went downtown.  I showed you Camden Yards.  I said, you know, Babe Ruth is from Baltimore.  And you was like, really?  Oh, God. 
[01:41:00]  Damn it.  No wonder we're both gay.  Yeah, I know.  That explains it.  Dr. Gay, of course.  I give him that nickname.  Oh, you did?  Sure.  We were playing Doc, though.  He says, go ahead, push back, Doc.  Push back.  It's always about the push back, isn't it?  Sure it is.  That way the police can't say you did nothing wrong.  You should have seen, Your Honor.  He was pushing his little hips back.  He was gobbling it up. 
[01:41:30]  It's like a little Pac-Man, honey.  Eating my seeds.  Waka, waka, waka, waka, waka, waka.  He was pushing back.  Going after all the little colored monsters.  I've never seen one eat one like that before.  Just gobbled it up. 
[01:42:00]  That sure comes into play all the time.  Whenever anybody brings anything up now, it's, you know, oh, the playground with sure.  Sure.  Sure.  Sure.  Well, we'll take a break, I think.  Sure.  Sure.  Richie Sambora coming in today.  Oh.  We ever have him on the show officially?  I don't think so.  No.  I don't know why I said officially.  It's either we did or didn't.  Unofficially.  Oh, you know what?  I think we did. 
[01:42:30]  Did we?  Did we?  Outside the MTV Music Awards that time with the retarded Laverne and Shirley?  Yes, yes.  Did they?  No, I don't know.  I don't know.  Remember them?  Yeah, they went away because they couldn't afford satellite radio.  Yep.  That's the only reason.  That is kind of a thing that kind of sucks about satellite.  I missed that Marion.  Do we ever get a, I don't even remember how that whole thing ended.  With the other ones blowing the hobos?  Yeah, because she was homeless and blowing dudes.  And blowing the hobos or something.  It just kind of faded away.  Yeah, let's get an update.  Yeah.  What happened to those two? 
[01:43:00]  Oh, man.  It's like Paradise Lost.  Yeah.  Last week.  It's like Twin Peaks.  What happened?  Last we checked, she was blowing hobos and she was homeless.  Yeah, that's the last I remember.  Not Marion, the other one.  She fired from King Cullen or something.  Wait, is Marion, who was the other one?  Lady Di.  Lady Di.  Lady Di has to be in jail.  There's no way she got her life together.  No.  No way.  We got to find out what happened.  Remember what a liar she was?  Oh, she was always lying, yes.  Remember she was...  No, no, I'm doing great.  Oh, you know. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, what a fucking, what a lunatic.  Yeah.  Someone has Marion's phone number.  Don't we have it still somewhere?  I've got some old numbers I can try.  Marion has him.  Marion's still in her place.  Oh, what a mess.  Imagine all three of them at the same time.  Yeah.  Lady Di, Marion, and Stalker Patty.  Wow.  Whatever happened to Stalker Patty?  Is she all right?  She's around.  Yeah.  She's got a big S on her shirt there.  Fucking stupid.  Marion's fucking comebacks were the best.  They were the best.  Your comebacks are the best.  Oh, yeah, exactly. 
[01:44:00]  That was it.  She was a chip.  Your comebacks are the best.  She was a chip.  Yes.  Wow, she really was.  I loved Marion.  And Fatso, when she would talk, and we'd ba-do, ba-do, ba-do, ba-do.  Oh, we put the mustache on her.  Oh, she looked exactly like fucking Laurel and Hardy.  Yeah, Laurel, what is it, Stan, Oliver Hardy.  Oliver Hardy, right.  And we'd play the music every time.  Dude, that made me laugh.  Remember we fucking tied her up or whatever so she couldn't get all the way into the studio?  Or she couldn't get into the studio from outside at any W? 
[01:44:30]  We tied her up?  Yeah, we tied her so she couldn't actually walk through the door.  Ba-do, ba-do, ba-do, ba-do.  She hated it.  Yeah.  Oh, she hated it with that fucking mustache.  Remember when we used to try to like, we were trying to talk and we'd tell her to shut  up, but she'd have to be going, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You'd be like, no, shut up.  I'm trying to say something.  Yeah, no, I know you are.  I know it too.  And then it's like, yeah, Uncle Anthony, right, right, when I...  She had no clue.  Iraq, you got a clip we can play?  We got a lot of new listeners. 
[01:45:00]  They have no idea what we're talking about.  Retard of the Vernon and Shirley.  They've known each other since high school and they were childhood friends and they just were  idiots.  I got an email from Marion recently or it might have been a Facebook.  But Viacom did the right thing and they put us on the red carpet for the MTV Music Awards.  This was right around 9-11, a mere week or two before, I guess.  And they gave us the prime location where we didn't have to be with any other press.  They were trying to take care of us because they were re-signing us. 
[01:45:30]  And me and Ann were like, oh, that's wonderful and all, but we don't want to fucking interview  these idiots as they're going into this thing.  Yeah.  So we got the retarded Laverne Shirley to do the interviewing.  And they did a bang up job.  They scared Mick Jagger.  I was standing there and Mick Jagger walked over and I shook his hand and those dummies  came over and he walked away.  They blew a Mick Jagger picture.  But you shook Mick Jagger's hand?  Yeah.  That's kind of cool, man.  Yeah, I said a little.  I like that.  Yeah.  And then they just said.  I don't remember me.  He might. 
[01:46:00]  No, he's probably one of those guys.  Oh, I know you.  Yeah, we shook hands one time.  It was so weird.  I wanted to say I like your act, but they hustled me away.  Hustled?  I met Mick Jagger backstage in Syracuse with Brother Weez, who's still good friends with  John Cher, a huge concert promoter.  So we're backstage and there's Mick just kissing John Cher's ass at the time because he was  like a massive promoter.  And I remember meeting Mick Jagger and just staring at him like a fucking lunatic. 
[01:46:30]  I had nothing to say, obviously.  No pick.  No pick.  Oh, man.  And that's one I would have loved to have.  That's a big one.  But everyone's just kind of hanging around like you didn't want to be the idiot.  I'd be the idiot.  I know.  Of course you would.  I want to say 88, 89.  This goes way back.  Steel Wheels Tour, whatever year that was.  Yeah.  I remember that one.  I met Mick fucking Jagger backstage.  I was like, holy fuck, that's the guy.  And I know I look like a complete man. 
[01:47:00]  Did Weez talk to him?  No, we were kind of watching because him and John Cher were just shooting the shit at that  point.  He came up as we're hanging out with John Cher.  Yeah.  You guys got pictures with Keith Richards, though?  I do, yeah.  That's a biggie.  I wish Charlie, I could have got Charlie Watts when he was here, but I was away.  Fucking crying.  Aww.  But if you get Keith Richards, you don't need Charlie Watts.  I want all four.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  Jimmy's a collect them all kind of guy.  I want them all four so I can put them in my fucking wall. 
[01:47:30]  Well, there's more than four, though.  Nah, but those four or five, I can get Bill Wyman, but what are the odds of that?  I mean, he left in what, 1980?  I mean, you know, or 90?  Who cares?  Bill Wyman was pretty important there for a while.  But I'm saying the four guy, I would take those four.  What's your four?  Ron Wood, Charlie Watts, Keith Richards, and Mick Jagger?  Yeah, no, Bill Wyman, again, would be a perfect fit.  Some would say that's the nucleus of the band.  What about the dead guy?  Brian Jones?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's died in the 60s, so I can't remember him.  He was pretty important.  Sure, but that's impossible.  Didn't Billy Preston do some time? 
[01:48:00]  Oh, yeah.  I think.  I think he was the one that did Beatles and Stones, right?  What a guy.  Pretty smart on his part.  I know.  Yeah.  All right, we're babbling.  Iraq, do you have some retarded?  Oh, right, right.  That's why we're babbling.  I knew there was a reason we were babbling.  Yeah, we were stretching.  Going through them live on the red carpet for MTV.  It was mostly a clip show.  I have a clip of them talking to Will Ferrell as they walk by.  I don't remember that one.  A lot of this stuff's not cut up in the way that we would do for a quick day. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, I hear you.  I don't remember the Will Ferrell.  They called him a pole.  No, get, what's his name?  NASCAR driver guy.  Oh, is it?  Earnhardt.  Yeah.  All right.  You got that one?  No, it's all mixed into this whole chunk here, so I'm trying to find it.  Oh.  I don't remember the Will Ferrell being anything special.  They just said, are you a Polak in front of the whole crowd of press?  No, let's hear it.  Walk by.  Just that one line.  Yeah, we'll stay here.  Let's listen to that.  Ferrell passing by again.  It's the retarded Laverne Shirley. 
[01:49:00]  Hey, yo, yo, yo.  It's the Chester Sheriff guy.  It's the Chester Sheriff guy.  Pick that pro.  Yeah.  Are you a Polak?  I love those pants.  Put the pants.  What do you buy them at?  The bargain basement?  Are you a Polak?  They're just insulting him.  They're just yelling.  Let's take it.  Check it.  Tic-tac-toe.  Tic-tac-toe or something?  You got another one?  She's Chip.  She really is.  She is Chip.  Yeah.  She's fucking funny, Marion. 
[01:49:30]  You like her Chip.  She killed me.  She might have been my mutter.  Your mutter.  Yeah, the Dale Earnhardt Jr. one was good.  That was awkward.  His father died very recently.  Talking about, you know, oh, sorry about you, Ted.  Right.  Don't bring that up.  I don't think so much of them yelling at Andy Dick, but I haven't heard it, so.  Let's try it.  Yeah, I guess.  Andy Dick!  Hey, Andy, news radio!  Andy, hey, news radio!  Come on, Andy!  Hey, Andy, come here.  What is the beer you?  What is the beer you guys? 
[01:50:00]  What is the beer you?  Who is the hot chick with Andy Dick?  Hey, Andy Dick, news radio!  I love that guy.  You mean the beard?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  I was just going to say that.  That is a nice...  What happened to Paulie Shore?  That's right.  We were behind them.  Yeah, yeah.  We were watching the whole scene.  The disaster.  I don't think we did one interview that day.  No.  God, that was so fucking fun.  They were really annoying. 
[01:50:30]  That's all.  I never realized she's fucking chip.  She is totally chip.  Lampreous.  She had me cracking up, though.  Oh, yeah.  Tic-tac doll is a good one.  Home run, Marion.  Wow.  Okay.  Big A614 on the Twitter.  Our pal Big A there.  He just tweeted a picture of Marion from 4th of July this past summer.  Oh, let's see.  Oh, God.  What the...  Oh, my...  She went blonde, huh? 
[01:51:00]  Well, she tried to keep her hair blonde.  She doesn't look much different.  Oh, Marion.  Oh.  Oh, you thought that...  I thought you said the retarded Laverne.  Oh, no.  Marion, yeah.  Big A just tweeted a picture of Marion.  Oh, my God.  Look at those droopy old tits.  She's got such a...  What do you call that?  That part of your lip where you can grow your mustache?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What's the name of that?  It's...  She has a Bloomberg-sized one of those.  It's like Chewbacca.  I have absolutely nothing bad to say about her. 
[01:51:30]  That chimp mouth.  I loved her, man.  Loved her.  Who?  Marion.  Marion was...  You know who fucking loved them?  It's Colin.  Colin, yeah.  Colin couldn't get enough of them.  I loved retarded Laverne and Shirley.  That's when Colin was like, I'm all in with this dumb radio show.  Yeah, yeah.  He'll tell you.  He used to bring them up.  I'm like, look, they've been gone for years.  Yeah, he was very disappointed.  E-Rock just found the Dale Earnhardt Jr.  Oh, okay.  We can play this to break. 
[01:52:00]  All right.  Got Richie Sambora outside the studio.  Let's invite him in to say a little hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Richie Sambora.  Hey, guys.  What's up, man?  What's up?  It's early.  What's up?  How are you?  How are you?  How you doing?  Jim.  That's Jim Norton.  Nice to meet you.  Danny.  How are you?  Anthony.  Anthony.  Opie.  I'm doing awesome.  Good. 
[01:52:30]  Got a new album out, huh?  New album, baby.  Well, that's pretty fucking cool.  That's something to feel awesome about.  It is.  It really is, man.  Yeah.  Usually rock guys aren't just awake in the morning.  I know.  You seem like you're comfortable being up this early.  Hey, man.  You got to do what you got to do.  You don't get up early usually, right?  I do.  You do?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm a single dad, so I got to drive my kid to school, man.  Oh, man.  You know, it's really funny because it's a strange dichotomy, you know?  Yeah.  It's like some days I get up and I go to the airport and get on a G4 and fly to Paris.  And other days I'm, you know, picking up dog poop and taking my kid to school. 
[01:53:00]  There's always something to bring it back down to earth, right?  Like, you're feeling like the greatest rock star.  Then it's like your kid's like, Dad, you suck.  And you're like, all right.  You're right.  Yeah.  Sure.  You know, it's like really funny.  I'm going, what the hell am I doing?  How old's the kid now?  She's going to be 15.  Oh, she's got her.  15.  So does she like Bon Jovi music?  Yeah, she does.  Yeah.  Because sometimes that works against you guys and they don't.  No, no.  You know, she likes my music.  She especially likes this new album.  Good.  Aftermath.  My new album.  Lowdown.  Yeah.  Aftermath.  Out tomorrow.  Out.  It's going to be out digitally tomorrow and then out on the 25th physically. 
[01:53:30]  Right, right.  Does she still think you're cool?  Yeah, she does.  She thinks I'm cool.  Isn't that crazy?  But we hear from celebrities and when their kids get a little older and you want to pull  the kid aside and go, do you realize what your father is?  Why don't you think he's cool?  You know, I'm lucky enough to have that cool relationship with my kid.  And I do a lot of cool stuff for her.  Like, if she ever wants to go see a show, it's like she gets the whole VIP package.  You know, I put her and her friends in a giant SUV and they go to the gig. 
[01:54:00]  And so I'm doing cool things like that, you know, because I'm away a lot, too, you know,  because I'm touring a lot.  So then when I'm home, I really plug in with her.  And ever since she was a kid, I've always treated her like she was almost an adult.  I've talked to her like that.  So we've always had a pretty, you know, a lot of, you know, just easy kind of candor between us.  So you see you play live?  And, you know, this is going to be the first time.  Yeah, she always comes to Bon Jovi shows.  Matter of fact, I mean, when we played Giant Stadium here a few years back, 
[01:54:30]  I just dragged her out on stage and made her dance, you know, with the John's kids were out.  She was out.  But she's an actress now, man.  She just got her first movie.  She's in a movie, a Judd Apathow flick called This Is 40.  Holy shit.  Damn.  That's a good start.  Isn't that weird, man?  That's a good start.  So check this out.  So the kid tells me, she goes, I want to be an actress, right?  Yeah.  So I go, well, honey, you got to do it the right way.  You have to go to a teacher and you have to do the whole thing.  I'll get your agent, the whole thing, right?  Goes to the teacher and I go, I don't know if she's going to be good or not, you know,  because she's my daughter. 
[01:55:00]  Of course, I'm going to think she's good.  Right, right.  Right.  So I just was like, and I said, teacher goes, yeah, she's got it.  I go, get the noose.  You know, because how many actresses I date in the way there, that ended up, I don't  know.  Yeah, that's a weird business.  How do you know?  Well, it's funny.  I've been rejected by enough times.  Do you, now she's starting to bring guys home at that age, 15.  Is she like interested in boys yet?  And let's let me go through that screening process. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, no, she's got boyfriends.  Does that bother you?  No.  You know what?  All you can do with your children is actually equip them with the tools to go out there  and take care of themselves.  But you know how guys are.  Doesn't that drive you nuts inside?  Believe me, I've told her that.  Okay.  And, I mean, it's only her second, like, little boyfriend kind of thing.  But, you know, sexuality is moving quite quickly these days because of media, TV, this, that,  the other thing, and stuff like that.  You know, so it's like, you know, like I said, all you can do is try to give them a cool  moral barometer. 
[01:56:00]  Because I always tell her like this.  I go, you know right from wrong.  You know?  Because you've got to depend on them because most of the time you're not with them.  You're not going to be around.  You know what I mean?  You're not going to be around, you know?  I ask because they're going to have a daughter pretty much any day, and it's freaking me out.  You're going to love it.  Well, I mean, I'm thinking of the future, though.  Don't even.  That's why I look at you, Richie Sambora.  When does it get weird?  12, 13?  You know, it hasn't gotten weird yet.  Knock on wood for me.  Right.  Because, you know, I talked to her. 
[01:56:30]  I said, so, having sex yet?  You do.  Oh, my God.  And she goes, Dad!  You know?  But I said, look.  I said, look, man.  You just talk to me.  Let me know what you're doing.  I said, but I always go, I don't care.  I'm going to tell you one thing.  I said, I don't know if it's going to be next week or when you're going to be 25.  But whenever you do it, make sure it's protected.  You know, I gave her the whole thing.  Right.  And I'm kind of casual about it.  And I have that kind of relationship.  It was so cool.  That's not bad.  Because my parents were stiffs when it came to sex. 
[01:57:00]  My parents didn't tell me nothing.  Nothing, right?  I got one talk after the film.  We talked about this.  I never had a talk.  They showed you the film at school.  And then, all right, if you have questions, we've prepared your parents.  And then I tell the story.  Actually, and it's true.  I climbed up into an apple tree.  I didn't want to fucking talk about sex with my dad or my mom or anyone else.  So I hung out up there all day.  And then he forced me to come down so we could have the talk.  Like, ugh.  I guess it's kind of weird.  It was weird because they weren't open about it when I was growing up.  Of course. 
[01:57:30]  Not at all.  That generation, God.  They were petrified, too, that they had to have the talk with their kids, right?  Yeah.  Come from a different time.  But you've got to talk about it now, though.  With social media and stuff and Facebook and Twitter.  It's like you know that if you don't, I guess, talk about it, they're going to find out about it from 500 other different sources.  So it might as well be from the way you want them to see it.  Absolutely.  I mean, you know, I mean, just even it's like, you know, you've got to take them to see some of the movies that you would think would be even questionable.  Because they're going to see them anyway.  So you might as well see them and be able to talk to them about it, hang out with them and all that, you know? 
[01:58:00]  I like the fact that you don't try to convince your kid, like, oh, no, I'm like every other dad.  You, like, give her the good treatment to the show.  That's why she still thinks that you're cool.  Like, a lot of celebrities try to, like, make their kids suffer, which is kind of stupid.  And I think it's great that you don't do that.  You know, I mean, honestly, it's like, you know, I feel like she's a partner almost in my career in a lot of ways because she actually lets me be on tour and I still have jurisdiction.  Right.  You know what I mean?  I'm still able to say, hey, that's not cool. 
[01:58:30]  And she listens to me even though I could be 5,000 miles away.  And that happens a lot, you know.  How's it traveling?  Are you bored with that yet?  Do you ever get bored with that?  You know, honestly, you guys travel the world.  Yeah, yeah.  Our last tour was 18 and a half months in 52 countries.  Wow.  How about that?  Did it get old or no?  You know what?  Since we took over managing ourselves probably 1991 or something like that, and everybody started having families and kids and all that kind of thing. 
[01:59:00]  So basically what we did was just, we all kind of like convene and go, hey, we need these couple weeks off, this, that.  So we do, we take those, we take continents or hemispheres in spurts.  Wow.  Because, I mean, you'd be hard pressed to like name 52 countries right now.  You know what I mean?  And I just did that last year.  But so there's all those good breaks.  And, you know, that really serves the family.  I got to be honest with you.  I mean, how can I complain?  My job, I mean, there's maybe five bands on the planet that do what we do. 
[01:59:30]  Right, yeah.  I mean, I'm walking out.  I mean, I went to the Giants game yesterday, right?  And when I walked in there, I said, hey, I opened this place and sold it out four nights.  Wow.  You know what I mean?  I mean, that's insane.  I mean, it still freaks me out.  I got to tell you something, man.  Whoa.  And they squeezed 100,000 in for you guys, right?  Yeah.  At least.  Unbelievable.  The concerts are like, they squeeze 100,000.  Yeah, we do a lot of big gigs, you know?  We do an arena run, but especially outside this country, we haven't played indoors since 
[02:00:00]  1988.  So we've been doing outdoor, you know, soccer stadiums and baseball stadiums and football  stadiums.  Yeah, yeah.  I got to ask.  Amazing.  I don't get to travel.  Listen, trust me.  I pinch myself all the time.  What country do you like going to?  Really like it.  You see it on your schedule.  You're like, oh, right on.  It's one of my places.  I mean, I have a lot of friends in London.  I really like to go to London.  I like Europe in general.  Italy is fantastic.  France, Paris is great.  You know, anywhere you go where there's like a different culture, you know, you're not 
[02:00:30]  going to Des Moines.  You know what I'm saying?  You know, because I like to get out and do stuff.  And now, you know, I've been in...  So you don't just sit in your hotel room.  You get out and try to...  Oh, never.  ...try to take it all in.  Holy shit.  Do you guys get...  Look at the picture.  That's amazing.  Jesus.  That's...  Look at this.  Quite a crowd.  Which one's that?  It's too big.  We can't even put it on the screen.  The O2 Arena.  Oh, that's even a little one.  I like when you see a bunch of people and you got to go, which one's that?  Like, it happens all the time.  That's an outdoor soccer stadium, right?  That's got to be 80,000 people. 
[02:01:00]  Is that...  Damn.  He said...  Richie's saying it's a little one.  If it's the O2, it's only about...  It's the size of...  It's about 20,000.  When is the last...  That's the stadium right there.  See?  Man.  That one.  Holy shit.  That's about 80.  That's awesome.  So that might be Hyde Park, which was 96.  When's the last place you guys didn't draw?  Like, do you remember the last time you went out and were like, fuck, man, the tickets are  like...  You know what?  No.  You can't remember, right?  I got to be honest with you, man.  It's been such an amazing ride here.  I mean, you know...  You know how few bands get that kind of longevity and be able to just consistently sell out shows 
[02:01:30]  for years.  There's five left.  For decades.  It's amazing.  Yeah, no, it's a really crazy thing.  And I think it's our dedication to touring.  It's like, you know, it's...  And we've done it right for them to be out sick.  You know, we were very smart when we were young because...  And we had nothing else better to do but live out of a suitcase and travel the world.  Yeah.  So we did that for the first three years of the band's existence.  And we didn't have hit songs yet.  But we were a good band and we kicked everybody's ass. 
[02:02:00]  Right.  And so when the song started to come, the garden had been seeded.  Yeah.  And then, you know, it was reaping benefits.  It was like...  I guess Runaway was like your first real big hit on the radio.  And it wasn't really big.  It was just...  It got noticed.  It was there.  It got noticed.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Especially here on the East Coast.  It was a regional hit more.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it was kind of like around here, you know?  And then...  And being right there with MTV, I mean, that helps out a lot. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, man.  That really took us to a new level.  Yeah.  I mean, they had to retire our videos.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, like our videos were number one for like...  Forever.  ...three months at a time.  Yep.  Living on a prayer is like...  Yeah.  Or an average.  Wanted and living on a prayer and all those things.  And I mean, it just continued.  So we've been very lucky.  But, you know, we've also made our luck by a lot of hard work.  Yeah, that's just it.  I mean, I don't think luck can take you for as long as you guys have been huge.  Exactly.  Yeah.  You can get lucky, have a few songs, and then you're just, you know, playing reunion gigs. 
[02:03:00]  You guys have been touring as...  The same thing you guys were when you first started.  Well, you know, I think it's a...  Number one, it's a testament of the writing process.  You know, Sean and I got inducted to the Songwriters Hall of Fame.  And that was a big honor.  I think it was probably the coolest honor I've ever gotten in my life.  Because your peers, all these great songwriters, you know.  Yeah.  So then, on this record, right, I got a chance to work with...  On my record, I got a chance to work with Bernie Taupin. 
[02:03:30]  Wow.  Oh, shit.  Really?  Which, I mean, Bernie, like...  He's written with three guys in his life.  He can write a song or two, I think.  Oh, man.  When you look at his catalog.  He's got a couple.  What is he writing?  I know who he is.  Every Elton John song you sing along to.  Yeah.  So, yeah, Bernie and I got a chance to write on this record.  And it's just...  The writing process, when you really start to relate to people,  I think that's where it starts.  That's the relationship.  That's where it starts.  That's the foundation.  And we've been lucky enough...  Well, not lucky.  I think we've worked hard enough to be prolific over the last 30 years. 
[02:04:00]  Wouldn't it be hilarious if every Richie and Boris song  sounds like Elton John songs now?  Because he's just a one-trick pony.  He just can write...  Yeah, right.  Shit.  Now they're onto me.  No, no.  This is Red Brick Road.  It's different.  I'm telling you, it's different.  No, it's true.  Hey, man.  This guy's brilliant.  I gotta be honest with you.  How do you make sure it doesn't sound like a Bon Jovi record when you do a solo song?  Oh, it doesn't.  But how do you do that?  You know what I mean?  You're exploring stuff you don't want to be doing in the band.  I think vocally, too.  No, no, no, no.  It's completely different.  People have that preconceived notion of what that is, you know? 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  What happens is that John and I have written every song in the room together at the same  time, and it comes out of that specific conversation that specific day.  So this record, obviously, any solo record that I make comes from a specific conversation  with myself any given day, and I get to cover the things that I want to cover.  And this album is quite a retrospective album of my life over the last seven to ten years  or something like that.  But what I found through digging through my own stuff, it's everybody's stuff. 
[02:05:00]  You know, there's a lot of commonality in humanity, man, where people are like, you  know, go, hey, I've been through that.  And that's the kind of stuff I write about.  This record is a really, really authentic record.  And what I get to do when you're the boss, you know, like I just hired this amazing band  that I hired, and we started jamming, and I said, you know, in rock and roll, there's  not a lot of guys that play solos anymore, which is completely strange to me, because 
[02:05:30]  when I heard Jimi Hendrix and Jimi Page and Clapton and Beck, that's the reason I wanted  to play guitar.  So besides being a lead singer in this project, I was able to play as much guitar as I want.  So there's four songs that have like extended solos and extended jams, so people have not  heard me like this.  And what's interesting is that also, it's like, the critics have, I've been getting  rave reviews, because they're surprised.  A lot, you know, a lot of times the record company guys are actually playing them songs 
[02:06:00]  and going, not telling them who it is.  And then they go, who do you think that is?  And they say, Richie Sandborg, they go, get the fuck out of here.  You know what I mean?  You're kidding.  They're actually surprised now, and I'm digging it.  And so I'm going out on tour.  I start October 9th in Europe, and we put the shows out, first day of pre-sale, they  all went clean.  And we put, I think New York goes up today, New York, Philadelphia, Toronto go up today.  I'm going to be playing at the Best Buy October 23rd, so please come and see me.  I've got to ask you something about songwriting. 
[02:06:30]  When you're younger, is it easier to write because you don't really second guess what  you're putting out there because you're just a kind of a dopey kid?  Is it harder when you get a little older?  Do you second guess what you're writing?  It's the exact opposite.  Really?  Yeah, because when you're a dopey kid, you haven't kind of honed the craft yet.  There is a specific art to it.  Because you have, you know, a specific amount of time.  Yeah.  And you have to tell a story with melody and with lyric, and you have to make it concise. 
[02:07:00]  And until you actually hit a song where people get it, like I wrote 50 songs before I wrote  the one where it became a real song.  Yeah.  So you're kind of fledgling.  And, you know, and listening habits are very important because when you listen to songs  and songwriters that you admire, you got to say, is this as good as that?  And you go, no.  It doesn't get good until it gets good.  So that happens a bit later.  Or some, I guess for some kids, maybe like a guy like Stevie Winwood, remember him? 
[02:07:30]  He was in traffic and 16 years old and just killing it.  I mean, content wise, like lyrically, do you second guess what you're writing and think  like, oh God, is that even relevant?  Or I would think as a kid writing the lyrics, you wouldn't second guess what you're, the  story you're trying to tell as much.  Well, you know, the interesting thing is that logistically you don't have it as a kid.  Because as a kid, you don't have the experience to look back and go, wow, I don't like  anymore.  Well, all you know, like, you know, when we first started writing our first albums, it 
[02:08:00]  was like The Road and Women.  So consequently, all our songs is about The Road and Women.  You know what I mean?  That's all we knew.  That's basically what we got, you know.  It worked well.  It worked really good.  It worked for you.  And then you got Superwoman White.  And that was the thing that really made a different incision.  When we wrote a song like Living on a Prayer, first time we ever used two characters, Tommy  and Gina.  And they, in essence, were the blue-collar people that were two blue-collar couple that 
[02:08:30]  were trying to make it in the world.  And it was almost like it was me and John, because we were a blue-collar couple that were  trying to make it in the world.  Not the gateway, but.  You know, and it became, Tommy and Gina became everybody all over the world, and that song  became everybody else's.  So then when you start, when you get to that place where you actually hit it, and then you  know, and that, oh, now we have to relate to people. 
[02:09:00]  Gotta stop singing about our own bullshit.  Isn't everybody on the road and pounding chicks?  I'm amazed you guys sit in the room together, because everything is done now.  So it seems like through email and through like, you know, so I'm amazed you guys would  actually just sit in the room together and bang a song out, which I think is probably the  best way to be creative.  Yeah, no, we're very old-fashioned when it comes to that.  We do it very simply.  So we still do it that way?  Absolutely.  That's the question.  It has to do it that way.  Have a guitar in your hand.  Guitar, a piano, and a couple of vocals.  Instead of everyone mailing in their parts, and then someone puts it together for you.  Yeah, that's a bunch of horseshit. 
[02:09:30]  A lot of bands went down that road.  Yeah, yeah.  And obviously they weren't successful with it.  Some people do it that way.  We, you know, and also what happens through every piece of material.  It's, there's a lot of things that are happening in the world and the culture that are feeding  your thought process and you don't even know it.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, right.  Like, you know, you know, there's like, if, like, just for instance, like, obviously,  you know, the economy's going bad, this and that, the other thing.  Like, I have a song called Nowadays on this record. 
[02:10:00]  And also the, even the political stuff that's happening, the polarization of the parties and  stuff like that.  Like, all that stuff is kind of creeping into my stuff and creeping into my lyrics.  You know what I mean?  And it's just, so every, for me, the way I like to write, I don't really take songs that  I wrote like two years ago or five years ago and bring them forward.  I write a specific batch of songs for a specific record because I believe that it's current.  And I want to take all the influences, whether it be musical, whether it be news driven, because 
[02:10:30]  you can write from a point of observation to when you're a writer.  I think that's smart.  That's how bands, I think, have longevity.  Because like, when you look back to the 80s, a lot of people were talking about like nuclear  war.  Like, that was what was on the country's mind.  And, but if you're still only talking about that, it just seems dated.  So it's probably better just to leave everything rest and then just kind of write whatever  it is that's happening now.  That's how bands stay.  What's going on today?  Yeah.  What's happening in the prison?  It's got to be nerve wracking to a point trying to keep up with your history and trying 
[02:11:00]  to top yourself or just remain relevant and not worry like, oh boy, when's the bottom  coming out of this?  You're comparing it to huge things, not maybe you're comparing them to massive success.  One thing that's interesting with us, we've built such a live base.  And that's really where it's all, the record business is in the shitter, you know?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, I mean, the record actually facilitates the tours now, which it was backwards for many,  many years, you know, from a business standpoint.  Yeah, the tour used to sell the records. 
[02:11:30]  Exactly.  Yeah.  And, you know, now it's like, so lucky for us, I mean, we were a touring machine for  the past 30 years.  And like I said, we sell records and we tour the 60 countries.  So we actually turn down gigs.  I mean, you know, I mean, we just go, okay, look, we're just going to play 100 shows and  it ends up invariably being 150 shows or something like that.  Wow.  Because you can't turn down the bread.  We're not going past 150.  You can't turn down the bread.  But it's that kind of thing you kind of got to ease into, you know? 
[02:12:00]  Now, you've been around a long time.  I wonder this about bands that have been around a while.  Do you ever look back at any old songs and go, oh, my God, that part's, you know, I wish  I could redo that part.  A little douchey.  Just some, some, yeah, oh, really?  Of course, you know?  I mean, and us as fans, we don't know the difference, obviously, but maybe something  in living on a prayer or something.  Nah, nah, nah.  You know what?  Honestly, again, or I wish I would have changed the lyrics.  I would change the lyrics if I had another shot at it.  How about the way we dressed in the 80s? 
[02:12:30]  That's the same thing.  You look back on that and go, what the fuck?  Is it hard to watch the old videos?  Is it hard to watch the old videos when you see the outfits?  I never watch them.  I don't want to watch them.  I don't want to watch them.  You know, but, you know, it's like, what happens is, is you said, of course, there's  things, you're doing your best at the time.  Right.  And maybe you didn't have the knowledge or to have the skill to actually be what was needed  for that particular song.  It's more of like that, maybe a musical piece or a part of it.  And then, you know, now, if you're going to play that song out on the road, you just 
[02:13:00]  change it to where you are now.  Oh, you do?  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah, so you have a little fun with it.  Yeah, no, listen.  We're a bar band.  Right.  We're just a big, big-ass bar band, man.  It's a fun of 120,000 fucking people.  Hey, did you ever have times like Metallica did in some kind of monster where the band was  going to fall apart?  Did you guys go through that, too?  Sure.  Is that like every band goes through?  I don't know if every band goes through it, but there was such a meteoric rise for this  band.  I mean, basically, you know, at the end of our first two records, although we had a gold 
[02:13:30]  record and although we had a platinum record, we were broke.  I mean, you know, because we were on the road.  And when you're on the road, man, we were paying everybody's salary.  My road crew was making more money than I was at that point.  No shit.  And I had, you know, riding royalties and everything like that.  John and I put everything up to pay everybody to make sure things were, you know, going to  stay together.  And, you know, so when a thing like Slippery happens, okay, you're riding a rocket ship  to fame, stardom, and everything that comes with it. 
[02:14:00]  Now you got five guys that are dealing with that fame and fortune at different speeds.  Then you add a little lifestyle in there.  Woo-hoo!  Little substance.  Little girls, all this other stuff.  And everybody starts to go in different directions.  So, and then, you know, everybody, then all of a sudden, when the finances catapult from  going from shit to Shinola, you got to kind of re-access things, you know what I mean?  So it took a little while.  Right.  After, like, 1989 and 1990, at that point in time, we really needed to, like, be away from 
[02:14:30]  each other.  From 1983 to 1990, we lived together.  I mean, we were crazy, man.  We'd go on vacation together.  And we toured months and months, 18, 16-month tours at a clip, right?  So, at that point, we just was like, fuck you.  We need to get away.  You would sign up for seven.  So, at that point, and then we didn't speak to each other for a little while.  How long?  How long a period?  Yeah.  I don't know.  We were both doing records and kind of just needed to be individuals. 
[02:15:00]  A year or two?  Mm-hmm.  And, pardon?  Was it a year or two?  We're just trying to figure out the timeline.  About a year, maybe.  About a year.  About a year.  And then, you know what?  We got a guy, like a corporate guy, that comes in and puts Humpty Dumpty back together  again.  Shit.  And it worked.  And we realized, we just realized that it was just like, hey, man, look, you put all  those things together.  You know, being broke, then being rich.  And everybody's experiencing it at different times.  And the substance.  And all the stuff, the business stuff, like the managers sticking in your ear and this, 
[02:15:30]  that, the other thing.  And we realized, we all forgave each other and went, of course that happened.  Right.  It's not like, it's not like, hey, you're a jerk off.  It was more like, you know, it was like, of course that shit went down.  It was supposed to happen.  Yeah, yeah.  It was supposed to happen.  And so what we did is we reconfigured.  We became the managers.  We started managing ourselves.  We were in control of our own destiny.  And we put out a record called Keep the Faith.  That record sold 10 million records.  And we had the biggest tour of our life to date, that particular, that particular tour. 
[02:16:00]  And that almost didn't happen.  And it almost didn't happen.  If you didn't figure it all out.  And you figure if the Beatles had done that, like even a band of that magnitude, they couldn't  figure out how to stay together.  They were only around six years.  Yeah.  Didn't forget that.  Six, seven years.  Yeah.  And it was a whole different, you know, just the business was very different back then.  Yeah, sure.  Everything was, and they were the kings, let's face it.  Right.  Do you like it better now?  Is it easier for you guys?  Do you have a digital download release and then a hard copy release?  Do you like it better now or do you prefer it the old way? 
[02:16:30]  You know, I liked the record business when it was crooked.  It worked great for us.  I mean.  What a great way to say it.  When it was crooked.  Yeah, man.  I liked it when it was crooked, man.  You know?  It's like, it really worked.  You know?  It was fun, too.  You know what I mean?  It was a lot more.  Yeah, it was a lot more fun.  Schmooze them a little bit.  Yeah, it was more fun, you know?  But, I mean, you know, you gotta roll with the punches now, you know what I mean?  And that's, you know, it's even like, you know, making this record, the aftermath of 
[02:17:00]  the lowdown for me is like, first of all, the expectations for me are, I wanted to make  something that people are gonna relate to, and people are gonna be able to rock, and  I think I've been getting such critical acclaim on this record, I'm really surprised and happy  because, really, Bon Jovi, you don't get that much critical acclaim.  And I'm gonna be able to go out and play this record as an individual and go out and jam  my ass off, and that's what I'm really looking forward to.  And show people that I'm a lead singer.  Right.  You know what I'm saying?  You know, I was a lead singer in all the bands I was in before I got to Bon Jovi. 
[02:17:30]  Right.  So, you know, it's a kind of a welcome return to, actually, and I did this with an independent  label, with my independent label, and I have all these different distributors, so basically  I'm the boss.  And I am enjoying that process completely.  That's awesome.  Why do you think the critics did, because the critics, they've fucked so many great bands  by not giving them, what do you think it was about you guys that they didn't,  give you guys the respect you were doing? 
[02:18:00]  You know, I mean, and it's, predominantly it's in the United States.  It's not really outside, you know, domestically we've had a problem because of the whole stupid  hair band thing, which, guess what?  All the hair bands are from the West Coast.  We're from New Jersey.  We were kind of coming from a glam period, like from CBGBs and, you know, those cats and  Great Gildersleeves and Maxes and those kind of things.  I mean, I grew up in that period.  I was in a band called the Screamin' Memeys.  Wow.  That was signed to Swan Song Records when I was like a 19-year-old kid, you know. 
[02:18:30]  So that's where that look, and you know, if you remember, the cats and the club band  at that time, you know, kind of were looking like that.  Right.  And we were broke.  Right.  We shopped at Chess King at the mall, you know what I mean?  I don't think...  We had no fashion sense.  We were horrible.  I don't think you have to explain that point too much because all the hair bands obviously  went away.  Yeah, yeah.  When you got swept into that genre of hair bands, your shelf life was extremely short.  Exactly. 
[02:19:00]  You know, there's only a few bands that made it past that.  And you know what's interesting?  It didn't get out of this country.  Really?  That whole moniker of the hair band thing never, never escaped this country.  So when you go to Europe or you go to Australia or South America or Canada even, you know, it  just never got up there.  So the stigma wasn't around us.  Right.  So even when grunge came in, our whole thing was we were just going to go out and play  countries that nobody plays.  So we went Indonesia.  Oh, no kidding. 
[02:19:30]  Kuala Lumpur.  And we were doing like, you know, 50,000 seaters in Kuala Lumpur.  We played Bombay, India.  50,000 people showed up.  So you waited for the grunge thing to just do its thing?  Yeah, you know, so I mean, if you're playing 40 countries and, you know, 20 are up and 20  are down, 20 are still up.  Yeah.  You got a story to bounce off of.  Then you come back to America and set that on fire.  That's smart.  So it was like, that's, that's the way we did it.  No flannels for you guys.  No flannel shirts for them.  Definitely a strategy to it.  That's smart.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Most people don't think of that. 
[02:20:00]  They just think, ah, they're just out doing something.  But maybe we can do a grunge song.  Thought went behind that.  That's pretty cool.  Oh, absolutely.  Let's try a grunge song.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  Maybe we can fit in with this whole movement.  That's what I'm saying.  Like when Rush was rapping.  It's also too, right?  Yeah.  Like Rush rapping.  Yeah.  If you tried, if you tried, if a band like us said we tried to do that, come on.  It's like everybody, the fans know you're bullshit.  Yeah.  You got to stick to who you are and evolve yourself.  Right.  And, you know, we kind of all cut our hair at that point to kind of disavow that whole thing  and say, look, how about this? 
[02:20:30]  And put out a record that sells 10 million records.  Yeah.  So we kind of went, you know.  Why is the hair so important?  Remember when Metallica cut their hair?  Everyone's like out of their mind.  People just feel like you're selling, it's this fan thing of you're changing.  And they, because everyone associates short hair with their parents.  Like, you know, growing up, we thought long hair was cool and short hair was your dad.  So when a band would cut their hair, they would go, fuck it, they're becoming like my parents.  It's no longer a rebellion.  Even though the bands were the same.  Fucking Metallica hasn't changed.  You guys haven't changed the same shit.  Yeah.  It doesn't mean anything.  Long hair almost looks, it looks bad sometimes. 
[02:21:00]  It's like a trying too hard.  Unless you're Aussie, then it looks fine.  But I mean, you know, even fucking Kiss and a bunch of bands cut their hair at one point.  It didn't look as good when they did it, though.  When you guys look more normal with short hair.  They cut their wigs.  Yeah.  Paul Stanley didn't look quite as good with short hair as fucking Bon Jovi does.  But I think also critics don't give blue collar guys as much.  There's an elitism with their attitude where the blue collar is just plain and simple people. 
[02:21:30]  And a lot of bands, I think, that have, no matter how popular you are, the critics don't seem to work against you.  It kind of works against you, yeah.  I mean, it seems like the more esoteric you are, depending on the publication, obviously,  that they're going to really run towards something that is like way left to center.  Right.  Do you remember reviews that you got very early on in your success that were like,  oh, these guys aren't going anywhere.  Oh, yeah.  Check this out.  The Rolling Stone when Slippery Wets came out. 
[02:22:00]  Of course.  Of course.  A smudgy copy of Quiet Riot.  No shit.  Smudgy.  A smudgy copy of Quiet Riot.  And then 17 million records later, we were on the cover of the Rolling Stone.  And how many years later, still doing it?  Yeah.  You know, we've been in band for 30 years now.  That's unbelievable.  Yeah, I mean, it's crazy to think, man, you know, and I mean, it's and last year we had  the biggest tour on the planet.  Our 18 months is the biggest tour on the planet. 
[02:22:30]  I mean, still, I mean, honestly, it's flabbergasted.  I walk out there and I just go, again?  Again.  You're coming to see me again, David?  I say the exact same thing for the exact opposite reasons.  I'm like, half a room again?  Again.  I can't even imagine the energy you must feel when you walk out on that stage.  That's pretty insane.  Over 100,000 people.  It's insane.  Do you still get a little bit of anxiety or butterflies or anything?  No, I get excited.  You get excited.  You know what?  The one thing that I've managed to do that has kept my feet on the ground is that, number 
[02:23:00]  one, if you're a working musician these days, you should be happy.  If you're able to feed your family and you're able to go and work.  Look, you're at my level, if you complain, you're an asshole.  Right?  So I never take that for granted.  If I'm walking into a studio with the cats and I'm going to lay down some tracks, man,  this is an opportunity.  It's a godsend for me to be able to do this kind of stuff and work out and play music and 
[02:23:30]  create and then walk out in front of a stage and play my songs and have it being received  to all these people.  It's something that you can't take for granted.  So that's number one.  And then you have to compartmentalize the media and all the crap that they write about  you.  And Lord knows I've been up and down and all around in the media and the tabloids.  And I have been for years.  And it's like, I don't let that get involved with the musical process and the art process 
[02:24:00]  of what that is.  And then, you know, and I've always had a lot of fun with the media anyway.  So I'm a gabber, as you guys can tell.  So I love to talk to people.  Is there any part of your personal life that you feel you would have done better at had  it not been for the success that you've had?  You know, not really at this point.  I mean, sometimes, you know, the stuff that comes out, I would think that would tweak my  daughter, which, and I don't want my parental kind of, you know, kind of hold that I have 
[02:24:30]  on her, you know, diminish any because somebody writes some, some crappy thing about me or  me, you know, just going to rehab or whatever, you know, that kind of happens, those kind  of things.  So, but you know what?  I've been very, very frank with her about it.  So now it's like, no, that's cool.  Yeah.  There's no, uh, nothing that could pop out and another reason why I made this record  and I covered a couple of those, uh, kind of, uh, you know, things that happened in my 
[02:25:00]  life.  I would have been remiss not to do it if I was really wanting to make an authentic  record.  And it's like, it's out there.  You know what I mean?  So, and it's like, I look, Hey, look, guess what?  This happened to me.  I'm sure it happened to a lot of people and it's not the only thing.  The record really is a very optimistic record and it's about triumph, about coming on the  other side, coming out on the other side with adversity and actually being better and  more understanding and more grown up.  And now, I mean, I'm coming at this shit like with, I'm taking like guitar lessons again 
[02:25:30]  and shit like that.  I really am.  Richie said more taking guitar lessons.  Yeah, man, I do.  Crazy.  I found a, I found a cat, I found a cat in California that works with these alternative  tunings and it's, you sound like actually two people when you're just one guy and it's  a whole other way.  I taught myself how to play.  So obviously when you're teaching yourself how to play, you miss some of the nooks and  crannies that are on the way because you're just aiming towards blues and rock and the  stuff that I was aiming for, you know?  So I just wanted to kind of add some other kind of elements to my learning process. 
[02:26:00]  So I decided to take some lessons, you know?  And, you know, I have a vocal coach that keeps me in shape because the throat is like  a muscle.  So it's just like you got to work it out.  If you want to stay, your voice wants to stay steady after 18 months and being 53 years  old, you got to work out, man.  It's just a part of the process.  I look at it at a very athletic level.  So you ever, you ever go to play, uh, sorry, Jimmy, you ever go to do a live show and go  like, fuck man, I don't have it in my voice tonight or that's a panic. 
[02:26:30]  It's a, it's a total anxiety thing, but see, after all these years, what you get and through  the coaching, there's the little chicks that you have to do.  And what's the trick for your voice?  If you have to, cause I know you can, the people have the, we'll get a steroid shot or  something in a pinch.  Well, you can, but that's when you're really bad.  You got to be kind of like, uh, then they give you the steroid shot and it basically  brings down the swelling in your cords.  So it's not like a, uh, it's an anabolic steroid. 
[02:27:00]  It's not like the guys that take football.  It actually shrinks.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  But, um, you know, it's just like a regimen of you got to sleep.  That's very important.  You got to be disciplined about that.  So if you want to go out and act up, you can't do it.  You gotta, you gotta go to sleep.  Sleep is the only way to repair your throat.  Um, there's different, you know, you got to steam and actually a workout is actually  good because it gets the muscles all heated up and it gets them warm.  So there's just things you can do to kind of ease into it. 
[02:27:30]  And you have to warm up just like, you know, before, before a workout, you stretch, you  got to stretch those cords, got to ease into your, you know, you can't just come out  and go 150 miles.  Yeah.  You're going to just kill yourself.  Brian Johnson said, that's what he does.  Oh, you see the other guys would fucking kill him if they caught him warming up.  He's like, you know what?  But that guy's got a battery in his neck.  Yeah.  He's turning that sucker up, man.  I mean, he's incredible.  He's been on the show.  He's a trip.  He's a great guy.  Oh, we love him. 
[02:28:00]  Great guy.  He's a crazy motherfucker.  Because his voice doesn't have to be melodic necessarily.  So, I mean, I guess if he's having an off night, it's kind of a little harder.  Yeah, but I've got to tell you, man, it's hard to scream like that.  Yeah.  I don't know how he does it night after night.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know how anyone could do that on tour, especially night after night like that.  It's beyond me.  I think what's interesting with you, most people are like, okay, he's the guitarist for  Bon Jovi.  I think with Wanted, just that one word, when you sang backup in that and sang Wanted, people  were like, oh, wow, that sounds really good.  Like, you weren't able to sing one fucking word and people were like, hey, he could sing. 
[02:28:30]  That's good.  It was very surprising.  I was like, wow, fucking guy's got to play.  But you are a lead singer in your other band.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Hey, when you travel to places like Indonesia, I wanted to ask you this too, because that's  such culturally different from us.  Is there any change in what they tell you guys?  Like, look, watch out for this or watch out for that.  And do you go out in places like that that are kind of deemed a little nerve-wracking for  some citizens?  Of course, for Americans.  Yeah, you know, we do.  They put like a SWAT team around us or something. 
[02:29:00]  And I have done that.  Like, in this past tour, we were in Athens and I'd never been to the Parthenon and all  that other stuff, you know, and I had to see that.  I saw it.  So, you know, the promoter was nervous as shit.  So, I honestly had like four guys on motorcycles and bodyguards around me because it was one  of those things because we had 68,000 people waiting to see us in the Olympic Stadium the  next night.  I said, but listen, man, I got to get out.  I want to see culture.  Right.  It's a part of my, it's part of one of the perks of my job. 
[02:29:30]  I want to feel what's happening.  And you know what?  I talked to some people.  I talked to protesters.  I was hanging out in the middle of all that shit.  It was really, really funny.  I have, I have this really cool picture of me standing on a wall and in graffiti, it  said, eat the rich.  Right in the middle of Athens.  You know what I mean?  It was like really, really cool.  And it was like, you know, you guys played in the first Olympic Stadium, the original one?  Uh, no, this was the last one that they built, that real beautiful one.  Yeah, because they got the original in there too.  Oh, in Greece?  Oh, it's beautiful. 
[02:30:00]  It was scary to go, like, if you went like within the last year or two, that's frightening  the way things are happening over there.  Oh yeah, we were there like last summer.  I went 10 years ago.  You could just walk around, no big deal.  But all these protests.  Oh, it's fucking terrifying.  Mexico, do you guys still play Mexico right now?  It's bad down there.  Yeah, we played Mexico City and when you're down in Mexico and South America, you basically  have to hire a security team that's indigenous to that specific area because they know where  not to go.  And basically like in Mexico City, they wouldn't let us out. 
[02:30:30]  They said hotel, gig, hotel, airport.  And I'm talking guys armed with machine guns and flanking our vans to get back and forth.  Oh, you guys would be a great guy.  Imagine kidnapping Bon Jovi for ransom.  Yeah, it's a monetary thing.  They worry that you couldn't.  And it's like that in places in South America, but it's easing up and it's not that bad.  But we don't care.  We kind of go and play.  Doesn't matter.  But you can't go out and enjoy Mexico City.  If there's a restaurant you want to go out to, are you able to do that? 
[02:31:00]  You know, I have done in the past, but over the last 10 years, no.  It's probably better not to.  Yeah, you know, you just got to, you know, do what you can.  And, you know, we did two stadiums down there, two nights in Mexico City.  We've been going down there for a long time.  That success is amazing.  Night after night of arenas.  We know all the success, but just to hear about it.  Who can do that?  There's like you guys.  There's like the Stones.  You too.  And Bruce.  And Bruce.  And maybe Jimmy Buffett is a much bigger tour than people.  I don't think he's on that level.  Yeah, you're right. 
[02:31:30]  That's much more U.S.  Yeah, well, you know, Jimmy is definitely domestic.  Oh, yeah, he is.  He's unbelievable.  I mean, he's working.  I love that guy.  He's crazy, man.  It's unbelievable.  He's a smart, smart dude.  But he's not going over to Germany and like filling up arenas.  Yeah, that country music doesn't reach that far, unfortunately.  I finally saw my first Bruce Springsteen show.  Holy fuck.  No.  Amazing.  There's nobody like him, man.  Holy fuck.  He's 62, I think, at this point.  And running around like he's 40-something.  The last time I seen him, I just went, I was in London and he was playing Hyde Park and  I had to go. 
[02:32:00]  You know, he's a friend of mine.  I've played with him many times.  And he's frightening.  He's that good.  Yeah.  I mean, to be that.  You don't realize how soulful he is.  Oh, man.  He's deep.  He's got some soul.  I mean, that cat's deep.  Is there a Jersey pride with you guys?  And you're just like, hey, we came from Jersey.  You're the biggest on the planet.  Both Jersey guys, right?  You know, I got to tell you something.  I mean, there's a Jersey pride thing.  You know?  I mean, I'm going to go see Bruce while I'm here for sure.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm definitely stopping in.  Even if I just catch a couple songs because I've been so busy. 
[02:32:30]  Stupid Roland.  He's there all the time.  He might ask you, though, to play a number.  That's what I want to ask.  How does he, like, if you're going to go up and jam with somebody, do they call you a day  in advance?  No, no.  We're Jersey guys.  We jam.  That's what we do.  Like, will he say if you're there?  That's the way we grew up.  We grew up cutting heads.  That's what we do.  He'll say, hey, do you want to come up tonight and play?  And you're like, all right.  If he calls me up, I'll play.  Absolutely.  That's hilarious.  Absolutely.  I mean.  Well, don't you have to negotiate that first?  No.  When Bruce says go, you say go.  No problem.  I mean, you know, it's like, that's a great thing. 
[02:33:00]  I'll have my lawyer call you lawyer.  You know, I'm still in all of my heroes.  Who are you?  You know, actually, you know, I'm doing the London show.  I texted Jimmy Page this morning about coming and playing with me in London.  See what you want to do.  I haven't looked yet.  My phone is somewhere else.  That's all I'd be doing is looking.  That's how you know you're famous when you text Jimmy Page and you don't check immediately  to see if he's getting back to you.  Your heroes are obviously Hendrix.  Because that's how I remember reading.  That's why you started playing, right?  Sure.  When you learned he died or something like that. 
[02:33:30]  No, no.  At 12 years old?  No.  You know what?  I started teaching myself at 13 and a half.  Okay.  I played before that.  I was I played accordion.  Believe it or not.  I started out on accordion.  And then I was doing like trumpet and sax and school band.  And I wasn't getting no chicks, man.  So I had to switch the guitar.  That's it.  But I always wanted to be a guitar player.  I always wanted to be like in the Beatles.  So I started to teach myself then.  But the reason I did it really is because when I heard these guys play guitar, like they were emotional. 
[02:34:00]  You know, like Dwayne Allman and Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Page and Clapton and Cream and Jeff Beck.  And all those guys were like, ah, man.  I said, I got to do that.  That's what I really wanted to do.  And obviously from a songwriting standpoint, I was listening to the Beatles of Bob Dylan, Rolling Stones.  And in essence, I think I grew up in what I call the renaissance of music because at that point in time, there was so many different genres of music that were happening.  And you weren't kind of delegated to be just into one genre. 
[02:34:30]  You could actually walk down every musical avenue.  I mean, in the Fillmore, you could walk into like Zeppelin was playing.  B.B. King was playing and Joan Baez opened the show.  You know what I mean?  So it was like a gamut.  You could walk into anything, man.  And it was all good.  That is true.  A lot of people, you know, nothing was considered like crossover back then.  It was just kind of there, you know, for you to pick and choose what you wanted.  And it was all cool.  You could like, you know, then it got really, really, really like very stiff where, you know, if you were into like heavy metal, you couldn't be into rap. 
[02:35:00]  Or if you were into rap, you couldn't be into folk or something like that.  Yeah, yeah.  Now it's all cross-polarizing.  Southern rock guys didn't like the fucking new wave guys.  And yeah, very weird.  You know, now it's all about cross-polarization.  So you basically just said that like if you had been blown a few times as an accordion player, there never would have been a Bon Jovi.  Or it would have sounded a lot different.  It really wouldn't sound.  A good possibility, Kat.  That's amazing, though, how like those are the guys that get the chicks. 
[02:35:30]  It's like, that's fucking great.  How do you feel about rock music?  It's kind of gone away as far as new bands coming up.  You know, I think there's a lot of good bands out there now.  They're just starting.  Which ones do you like?  You know, I listen to a lot of indie bands.  There's a band called Silver Sun Pickups.  Fits in the Tantrums.  I like My Morning Jacket.  You know, bands like that.  You know what?  I am a guy that picks up three albums a week at least.  Still.  Yeah, you know, I mean, I run on a treadmill. 
[02:36:00]  You got to keep in shape at my age, you know, if you're going to get through all this shit.  So, basically, that's why I like to listen to new music.  Richie is so into music.  Yeah.  Like, that's a guy that if he didn't, if you didn't make it in music, what do you think you'd be doing?  I don't know.  You'd probably just be a bum.  You never know.  No, I'm fucking with you.  You never know.  But you're so into music.  Like, it is absolutely your life.  It's in my DNA, really.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, I would be a musician doing something, but, you know, I grew up in a very blue-collar thing, 
[02:36:30]  and my dad taught me, like, you're the man.  You've got to have a job.  You've got to support your family.  That's what you've got to do.  And so I would be doing whatever, but I would have to play music.  Music was a deep part of my fabric, and I had an ear.  I swear to God, man, I would hear something on the radio.  I could pick up the guitar and basically play that just from ear.  That's exactly right.  You know, so I understood the language of music very early, very early. 
[02:37:00]  And you can read music, right?  I mean, that's something a dumb question.  I did it ask backwards, man.  I started teaching myself, you know, how to do things by ear, and then I went back and  took theory courses and kind of put it together backwards to a point where I was, you know,  adept at both.  But that's something like an artist.  You know, you could teach somebody to pick up a paintbrush and paint a picture, but if  you have that natural ability, that puts you well beyond people that have to learn it.  You know, you could then take lessons to improve yourself, but if you don't have that initial, 
[02:37:30]  just like you said, in your DNA, I don't think you're going to attain that greatness.  Yeah, you know, I mean, the thing is, is that, you know, like when people will come see me  play on the solo tour, they're going to see me wind out.  And when I actually get out of my body and I'm just letting shit roll, you know, where  it's just, you're going to see the creative process on the spot. 
[02:38:00]  That's what's real.  See, that's what you want to go see Led Zeppelin in the old days, or Jimmy, or Eric play with  Cream or something like that.  These guys were creating on the spot.  That's the sex.  That's the jizz right there.  That's what you want to see.  And that's what the women want to just go, I love you.  Because certain guitar players will just play a part in the song because that's where it  fits, and it needs a guitar here.  You guys are playing it out of feel.  Like, that's, I feel that should be here, and it should be played this way. 
[02:38:30]  And it's not just this technical, insert slot A into, you know, tab A into slot B.  What I've done specifically, especially on this record, is, you know, I come in with an  architecture of a good song, and then, so you're working it up, the process is you start  jamming, things start cooking, and all of a sudden it's sounding real great.  I'm like, roll tape.  Go.  So the stuff that you're hearing is kind of coming off the floor organically.  Oh, you mean it's not the thousandth take? 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  It kind of writes music a little bit, don't you think?  Honestly, the first couple of takes are usually the best.  Once you get to kind of like, you can actually understand what the changes are in the song  and everything like that, then I just kind of left stuff going and enjoyed it to the  point where, as I said, on records nowadays, rock bands, and even though there's a lot  of good guys out there, I believe that they're not winding out, you know, like we used to  hear on Zeppelin 1.  The process looks exhausting. 
[02:39:30]  When you get to see those documentaries of these guys putting their albums together,  you're like, holy fuck, man.  And I'm sure you remember, though, too, with the big fucking track machines with the tapes  going and what a pain in the ass it was.  I loved it all.  With a bum take.  Yeah, yeah.  And then he'd have to rewind.  Now it's just fucking just keep playing, do everything, we'll fix it.  Yeah, right.  Because digitally, you could just rip the shit apart.  Absolutely.  But with tape, it was a lot more arduous.  Oh, yeah, man.  I mean, you know what, though? 
[02:40:00]  It was all fun.  Yeah, no shit, right?  It was all fun, man.  I mean, it was all fun.  I mean, I love every part of the whole process, you know, the writing process where you're  actually making shit out of nothing, sitting in your bedroom and conceptualizing the song  and writing the song.  Then you bring it to the band in the studio and it becomes a record.  And that's beautiful.  And then, obviously, the end process is taking it to the people and getting that immediate  gratification of this song is getting through.  So, I mean, so the whole process, the whole gamut, you know, and then, you know, after 
[02:40:30]  throughout the years, I've learned how to be a producer, I've learned how to do all that  kind of stuff from a technical aspect of things, you know, and that's beautiful, too.  You know, I've been able, lucky enough to produce a couple bands and produce a bunch  of hit songs for other people and a bunch of stuff, you know.  Well, we should listen to something off the new record.  Yes, and it's called, to be known, it's Aftermath of the Lowdown and tomorrow is the digital  download starts?  Digital download starts tomorrow.  And, of course, the real Sambora is Richie on Twitter. 
[02:41:00]  My Twitter.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, you went to the game yesterday.  So, Giants, what do you think this year?  Man, they look like crap in the first half.  I was afraid.  And I like that because I'm a Jets fan.  You know, they look like crap.  And then they came back.  I know.  Eli had a fucking monster.  Eli had a monster game at the end.  Almost set the passing record.  Unbelievable.  Three yards short of Phil Simms' record there.  Yeah, it was great to see.  You liked the game.  I love it.  My Jets sucked yesterday.  I am fucking mad.  No, I felt bad for you, man.  Do you really? 
[02:41:30]  I felt bad.  You know, week one, they look great.  Sanchez is like, all right, we got a quarterback.  I know, right?  Yesterday, he had won.  The first series was great.  And then he fell apart the rest of the game.  And what did Peyton do yesterday?  Peyton plays tonight.  Oh, Peyton plays tonight.  Yeah.  Excellent.  Yeah, you're not one of these guys, Giants suck, you go to the Jets, are you?  You know what?  Thank you.  I respect you.  I like football.  I watch every game.  Right.  I got that DirecTV thing.  And if I'm not at a game, I'm like, you know, I'm totally watching everything. 
[02:42:00]  You do the red zone?  I do the red zone.  But I also like to switch, too, because I'm in a pool with a bunch of guys, and it's  a lot of fun, man.  You know, and I'm a big sports guy from day one.  You know, actually, you know, John and I own the Philadelphia Soul, the arena team.  I know.  You know, we had a lot of fun with that.  We won the arena bowl after six years.  I know.  Yeah, pretty cool.  That is cool.  When it's your team, it's cool.  Ooh, it's a whole other deal.  Oh, yeah.  No, it's like, you're in it, man.  You're in the locker room with the guys saying a prayer.  Come on, motherfuckers. 
[02:42:30]  You know, it's a different thing, man.  All right, we're going to play Every Road Leads Home to You from Richie Sambora's new  CD, Aftermath of the Lowdown.  This was fun, man.  Come back and see us.  I'd love to see you guys again.  Thanks for having me, man.  Thank you.  Richie Sambora, everyone.  Wow, that was cool.  Richie Sambora.  He could talk.  Yeah, he's great, man.  Hey.  I don't understand some people that listen to this radio show.  Did Roland ask him?  Yeah.  This guy just writes. 
[02:43:00]  Where is it?  But then did he ask him?  I don't know.  Oh.  Okay, sorry.  Where is he now?  I'm trying to get him for Boneyard, but he might have to leave.  Right.  But, because this might have been his out time anyway.  I'm trying to get five minutes or ten minutes for him for the Boneyard show.  I thought he was a fun interview.  Yeah, I tweeted that we had a great time with him.  And then this guy writes.  And it's more, I'm trying to understand how people think.  Trust me.  Because it's just one dummy.  He wrote, he wrote, he wrote. 
[02:43:30]  Where the fuck is it now?  Oh, here we go.  Fuckin' boo.  Richie Sambora?  Really?  Fuck him and Bon Jovi.  They stink.  Now, here's my point.  He's just one idiot.  Trust me.  I get that part of the game.  But it's like, he was really interesting as far as talk radio goes.  He's a rock star.  He's a rock star that has stories because he travels the world.  And he's in front of well over 100,000 people on most nights. 
[02:44:00]  And he's talking about armed guards in Greece.  And he's talking about Mexico City and this and that.  It was fascinating to listen to the guy.  Whether you like or don't like his music.  Yeah, he's an interesting guy.  Why is it that you'd go, oh, he's one of the guys from Bon Jovi.  Well, I don't like Bon Jovi.  So, no, I'm not going to listen.  That's what I don't understand about his comment.  You have every right to think that way.  But I don't get it, you know?  Because it's not like we're sitting here playing a million Bon Jovi songs.  No.  The part of him you don't like, Bon Jovi's music, we didn't play any of that. 
[02:44:30]  We played one of his solo songs, you know, at the end there.  Which was good.  Right.  Because I'm not a huge fan of Lady Gaga, let's say, okay?  But if someone that knew what the fuck they were doing was interviewing Lady Gaga, I would absolutely listen.  Lady Gaga.  I would absolutely listen thinking this could be fucking kind of interesting to listen to.  Remember that?  Lady Gaga.  Who was that?  Fucking 60 Minutes.  Oh, right.  That guy.  You know who was an interesting, oh, fuck, I just had it and it went away.  I don't know.  Yeah.  But it was something you were saying. 
[02:45:00]  It was like somebody who I wouldn't have been interested in their music, but hearing them interviewed was really...  Oh, fucking Ronnie's done a million times.  Who the fuck did he...  I just can't remember.  I just had it.  I have a couple that Ronnie have done over the years, too.  And it's like, oh, who the fuck was it?  Shit.  Ah, whatever.  Someone that I would absolutely never download any of their shit.  But I know Ronnie could do a good interview.  And I'm like...  And I was so into just listening to this guy talk.  To the point I don't remember who it was.  By the way, I had to Google image his daughter. 
[02:45:30]  Holy shit.  Hot.  I think she's going to go far.  Oh, really?  Yeah, she's pretty fucking...  She's only 15 at this point.  Yeah, can we say...  I mean...  Get the fuck out of here.  She's quite a looker.  She's already on the runway, too?  Or is that...  That's her?  I don't know what that is.  Yeah.  She's pretty.  No, don't do the runway.  Runway model.  I like them when they're just...  Stop it!  I'm trying to help.  I like them when they're just regular fucking girls without all that over-top makeup. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, man.  Wow, which one do you pick first?  I know.  All right, go to something.  Oh, man.  Dude.  She's lovely.  Holy God.  Oh, fuck.  Jimmy Douglas, holy God.  She's a lovely, lovely young lady.  Yeah, he's going to be fighting them off.  Do another.  Do another.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, shit.  Who's the mom?  Heather?  Yeah.  Locklear?  That's Heather Locklear fucking shit in there.  Right.  She's got them fucking...  Dude, 52 different countries. 
[02:46:30]  I know.  In 18 months.  Jesus.  That is...  The magnitude of that is mind-burning.  Yeah, you just want to be famous in one country.  He's famous in 50...  At least 52 countries.  In all of them.  He's massively famous.  Yeah, he probably can play in just about every single country out there.  Selling out just hundreds of thousands.  That's what Sam would put in.  Rock star offspring.  And then you'd just get fucking people.  Yeah.  All those.  You'd get pictures of noodles. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  Noodles.  But Richie was great.  I liked his...  Where did Roland go?  He just left.  I liked his stories.  His stories?  Yeah.  Stories.  So...  You want to hear what Yahoo does for their people?  What you mean?  Sure.  Oh, Yahoo.  You know how...  I think you know, at this point, I'm kind of obsessed how companies treat their employees.  I'm obsessed by this.  Yeah.  Yahoo offers every employee the iPhone 5. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, yeah?  Just like, here you go.  How many people?  Huh?  How many people is that?  I wonder.  Yahoo.  Jesus.  That's a good question, but...  Quite a few.  22 countries.  They're in 22 countries.  And they're offering every employee an iPhone 5.  iPhone stinks.  Yeah.  First of all, look, you don't have to be a fanboy.  I understand that.  But to say iPhone stinks is ridiculous. 
[02:48:00]  It's ridiculous.  Maybe you like another phone more than the iPhone.  Maybe you don't like Apple products as much as you like other things.  But it doesn't stink.  It doesn't stink.  I like who wrote it, though.  It's fucking...  It's Steve BlackBree.  Look, I haven't made the leap into the iPhone world, but I acknowledge it's a good phone.  It's so dumb.  I've chosen the Galaxy S3, but I can see how that's fucking cool that 12,500 employees are 
[02:48:30]  getting a brand new iPhone 5 from Yahoo.  You just come off stupid sounding like an idiot when you say things like that.  iPhone sucks.  Yeah.  It does stink.  It does stink.  I'm done.  I threw up all that Kool-Aid.  What phone...  It loses the 3G too much.  Fuck.  What did you do?  Well, I'm probably going to swap out and get something else.  I've had iPhone.  I've had AT&T.  Now I've had Verizon.  And they both lose 3G every 20 minutes.  It's ridiculous.  What phone did you get working here at SiriusXM? 
[02:49:00]  None.  That's why I'm getting rid of my iPhone.  I can't get a phone to work here so far.  Won't they give you a phone here if you use their...  And then they get to take it back or some shit?  Well, don't get me started, Jimmy.  Why, Abbie?  What happened was they gave me a shitty work phone.  So I said, you know what?  I'm going to fucking upgrade and get a really nice phone for myself.  And then at the end of that, when I wanted to upgrade that phone, I wanted to give that  phone to my brother.  They said, oh, no, even though you bought that phone, because our software is on it, 
[02:49:30]  it is now our phone.  They wanted to know you bought it?  Dude, they won that battle.  Who said that to you?  They won that battle.  This is a few years ago.  A phone I actually bought and brought in and said, here, this is what I want to use as  my work phone, because you gave me a shitty one.  Fast forward, whatever it was, eight, nine months.  I'm like, okay, my brother, you know, he's not doing as well as I am.  He would love a pretty, a relatively new phone.  They're like, no, sorry, we can't give it back to you, because we now own it, even  though I paid for the phone.  To this day, it drives me fucking nuts. 
[02:50:00]  Were they paying for the new phone?  What do you mean?  Meaning, like, you said they said, no, we own this phone.  No, I never gave them another phone to fucking do that to.  They didn't buy a new phone for you?  I got the work phone.  It's on my dresser at my house.  I haven't touched it in months, because it's an old phone.  Once their emails and stuff are on it, it becomes their property.  It becomes their property.  How stupid is that?  Even though I bought it, and I argued this point, and I actually lost this  point.  I'm like, this is insane.  Yeah.  Yeah, because I wanted to give it to my brother. 
[02:50:30]  What a bunch of fuckers.  But Yahoo turns around and gives all their employees a brand new iPhone 5 like it's  nothing.  And they're taking out, the best part of that is that they're no longer doing  BlackBerry.  I'm so happy those arrogant scumbags at BlackBerry are fucking going to, they're going to go  out of business.  Yeah.  Because they, look, I wanted to go to BlackBerry.  I bought the Storm, because it had Verizon, and they made it a click.  It's got to be like the buttons.  There you go.  Goodbye.  Yeah, man.  I don't know what they did.  They liked that little clicky feel. 
[02:51:00]  Bye-bye.  Because people, that's what people want, is a buttony clicky feel.  Boy, that guy that thought that.  Boy, did they fuck that up.  Fucking dummies.  You think they fucked that one up?  I hate them.  I think they're a terrible company.  Glass screens.  I was a BlackBerry guy for way longer than I should have.  And I don't know.  My cell phone guy, to this day, I go, let me see that new BlackBerry product.  And every time now, I'm like, oh, God, no.  They still can't figure it out.  Gotta have the button.  Gotta have the button.  People like the buttons.  That is funny.  Him and the new Coke guy are sitting at a bar all drunk, just going, yeah, people just 
[02:51:30]  didn't appreciate the genius of it, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, fuck that.  I hope at some point in the future, like, clear soda is, like, all the rage.  And, like, the Crystal Pepsi guy is like, fuck, fuck me.  Come on, man.  Yeah.  By the way, Bob and Tom are doing prostate exams on their regular radio show.  All right.  A bit we're not allowed to do anymore.  There you go.  Remember when we did that?  Wait, we can do it here, can't we?  I don't think so.  Well, maybe with Dr. Steve.  Oh, we sort of got that.  I think we can legally, as long as all the right things are implemented. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, fair enough.  I think we sort of could do that.  We did it, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think we're good on that.  Yeah.  All right.  I'll take that slam back.  By the way.  The bullet of the way.  We ran out of time, but that stupid mayor of ours got the sugary drink fucking thing in.  Yeah, of course he did.  Of course he did.  He got the ban in.  I'm just amazed by that.  Well, like someone said, you can't get a UFC vote, but you can do this because, you know,  the fucking nanny, Mommy Bloomberg, wants to tell everybody how to live, and she can certainly  do that, that fucking old queen, but we can't get a UFC vote here. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah, yeah.  So, local government is deciding how much soda you can have at one time.  Sure.  That's just amazing to me in America.  He has said that he's put a lot of these things in place since he's become mayor, and people  are all up in arms against it, but you can't find one thing that he's done that people now  complain about because they've all accepted it and now actually like that.  What are some of the other ones?  The smoking thing and putting the restaurant ratings, putting the calorie counts. 
[02:53:00]  That's all fine.  Things like that.  Well, that's what he's saying is like, that is the same as this.  No, it's not.  This one is way...  The calorie count is just educating people.  That's letting you know, right.  People know if they have a sugary drink, it's not good for them.  Let me tell you...  I'm sorry, and if they don't know, then fuck them.  Who brought up the greatest fucking point about this was Danny Ross, about the movie theaters.  Oh, yeah.  The fucking...  You don't even think about this.  When you go into a movie theater, you're going for fucking three hours with the previews  and everything in a long movie. 
[02:53:30]  You get your popcorn, and then you get a giant fucking beverage in a 55-gallon drum because  you don't get up during a movie to get more soda if you're thirsty.  You just sit there and watch the whole fucking movie.  Typically, it's not just you.  You're going with your chick.  Now, if I'm going to the movies with my chick, I'm not getting two large combos so we  can each have our big, giant shit.  You get one and you share it.  You know what I'm saying?  And now you're going to take up two cupholders because now you need...  They say, well, just buy two sodas. 
[02:54:00]  So I'll have one in the cupholder, one between my legs and...  But still, now it's only going to be 16 ounces.  I'm going to be done with a 16-ounce movie soda with ice in it and shit.  I'm going to be fucking done with that before the movie starts.  Exactly.  It's not the mayor's fucking business.  In the end, it's just not.  It's not his business.  I'm all for educating the public.  But you can't actually then say, but now that you're educated a little more, we don't want  you doing this.  That's ridiculous.  And I don't want to listen about health costs and all that going up. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah, okay.  Because this is something that should just never happen in America.  I get it, though.  I get why it's happening.  And yes, you do have to think about that extra serving to have.  But there's a time and a place for shit like that.  No one needs to go to 7-Eleven and walk out with a liter of soda in a cup.  That's just retarded.  I want a liter of cola.  But at a movie theater, that's just a legitimate place where you typically get big things because  you're going to be stationary for a long time.  I don't even like to go piss because I'm going to miss something.  I don't think I've ever got enough. 
[02:55:00]  So now I've got to go get another fucking soda.  Get out of my face.  During a movie.  I don't think I've ever gotten up to take a piss or get anything else to eat or drink  from a movie theater because you don't want to miss part of the fucking movie.  And what's scary is, you know, they don't stop here.  No.  We've learned that over the years.  No.  Banning large sugar.  This fucking cocksucker.  That's unbelievable.  And I'm going to say it again.  I left the city Friday at 1.30 so I could avoid the traffic.  There's a major traffic problem going in and out of Manhattan to Long Island. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, hell.  That is causing major health problems to people that have to deal with that on a daily basis.  Why don't you take care of that?  I guarantee that causes heart attacks all the fucking time.  The stress you have to feel.  When you want to go home and you're just bumper to bumper day after day after day because there's a problem that needs to be addressed.  But meanwhile, he fucking supports the Nathan hot dog eating contest because this fucking rich sissy thinks that he knows what moderation is, but nobody else does.  Right.  Like this fucking, this queen knows what moderation is and can handle having the hot dog. 
[02:56:00]  And I like to have this with the mayo.  I know what it is.  But the rest of us can't.  Yeah.  Like he has taken the ability to get a big large soda and I wouldn't even drink that.  I think they're terrible.  I want a diet.  Right.  But if you want that, you should have the right to buy it without this fucking, without this queen inserting her will.  Yeah.  You know, just the way she changed all the roads because she doesn't have to deal with the roads the way we do because, um, because the, the, uh, the queen Mary who runs the city does not have to deal with that. 
[02:56:30]  Well, yeah.  It doesn't have to deal with it.  She knows moderation.  He wants to see, he wants to see flower pots.  Yeah.  Of course she does.  Right.  Of course she does.  And bike lanes everywhere now.  Yes.  All these roads.  Did you see all the fucking streets?  They now have a strip sometimes up right up the middle of it, of a bike with a little lane with bicycle.  Oh, sure.  And it's like, it works, it works well for other cities.  I question if it works well in Manhattan. 
[02:57:00]  Holy shit.  I think we're a unique case here in New York.  It's insane.  I hate him.  He's trying to make the bike thing a big, a big deal.  How much longer does that fucker go up?  I don't, I don't see many, uh, people using the bike lanes.  Other cities, it's a whole culture.  Yeah.  You go out to San Francisco, they're political groups, these, these, uh, bikers.  Yeah.  They're actual political groups.  But here in New York, you know, you see that green fucking lane.  No one's using them.  Just taking up space.  I can't wait until he's out of office.  And, and, and why doesn't he just concentrate on talking about what a scumbag Sheldon Silver 
[02:57:30]  is instead of that?  Yeah.  Another guy who wouldn't push the vote through.  Can't get, we can't get an adult entertainment here.  Um, but he can get that fucking vote passed through immediately.  One more blue one here.  Oh, it makes me sick.  I can't wait until he's out.  November 2013, he's out.  It's not going to make people, uh, people healthier, healthier, excuse me.  They're not going to, they'll find a way.  Just, you know, he's a fucking rich elitist.  I really have, really have such a hate. 
[02:58:00]  It's disgusting.  It's not good.  Not good in America.  Anybody in the, in the pipe?  I know Tony Danza's thinking about running for mayor.  Yeah, he talks about it.  He talks about it all the time.  Alec Baldwin, uh, declined.  Oh.  Let's see.  On the Dem side.  He's a Democrat?  Tony Danza?  What?  No, uh.  Oh.  Unknown affiliation.  Unknown affiliation.  Unknown affiliation?  Oh, didn't, um, didn't the MTA do another, uh, uh, hike rate or whatever?  Rate hike.  Rate, rate, rate. 
[02:58:30]  Did they?  I'm tired all of a sudden.  Rate hike.  Oh, boy.  Because I, I, I was listening to 1010 Winds and they're up in arms again.  Oh, really?  Yeah, is that?  Oh, yeah, look at that.  Isn't that way more important than a dumb sugary drink?  This is real shit that people are dealing with.  I, I, and you're, I know the MTA is their own, their own thing.  It's tough to work with those fucking cunts.  But, I mean, as the mayor, you gotta figure something out.  That's a much bigger problem than a dumb fucking soda.  I'll tell you, it's tough to give a fuck about the subway system when you don't take it.  Because I didn't take the train for a long time and I just forgot. 
[02:59:00]  Like, who cares?  But then you start taking the train again and you start remembering how shitty everything is and it fucking sucks.  They keep raising the rates and the, and the service is not much better.  No, this is.  They'll try to tell you it is.  Every once in a while you get into an air conditioned car.  That's nice.  And not only that.  Every once in a while, though.  But there, there's, the employees there are not of quality, let's say.  They fucking hate you.  They're not quality.  They, uh.  They hire people that fucking hate you.  They're a station.  Well, you know what it is?  I forget.  What do you deal with?  How do you, why do you need to deal with anybody that works for the MTA? 
[02:59:30]  You don't really as much.  You don't really, but there should be somebody there.  Like, sometimes there's a lot of, there's a lot of tourists, obviously, in Manhattan.  And they have a lot of questions.  And, uh, you know, if they could actually find a token booth, because there's not, they're ripping them out left and right.  I think the interview process is this.  Do you hate human beings?  Yes.  Okay, you're hired.  I see people.  We're going to put you in a glass booth.  Those, those people, they just point, they'll point you to the map.  Some, the tourists will be like, hey, excuse me, could you tell me where to go to?  And they'll just go, yeah, there's a big map right there.  Great, thanks.  They're complete assholes, those people.  Complete.  And if you, and like, I don't even know what their function is anyway, because if, I thought is like, the thought was anyway, if you don't want to use the machine or if it's busy, you could go to the person. 
[03:00:00]  But now, even when they're not busy and you want to get a MetroCard, they'll just go use the machine.  Right.  So it's like, what the fuck are you doing?  I don't even know.  And the stations are dirty.  They're falling apart.  Probably has some kind of union thing where we want to keep some of our workers in place.  I mean, it's not like the subway is, uh, something like that.  Should be the cleanest place on earth.  But you know what?  Now that I've had the opportunity to visit some other major cities.  It's embarrassing what they got. 
[03:00:30]  Exactly.  It's fucking embarrassing.  Yeah.  Some of these places, you want to just hang out in the subway system.  It's so nice.  It's disgusting.  I'm not even kidding.  They got fucking stores and bars and Starbucks as you're waiting.  If this goes to $2.50, that's per ride.  And right now it's $2.50 a ride.  But it just went to $2.50 a ride.  I know.  But where's the money going?  Where's all that money going?  Nothing seems to be getting any better.  Standing in urine smelling fucking decrepit cement.  All right.  That's fair.  But to bring it all around, don't you think Mayor Bloomberg should try to figure something 
[03:01:00]  out here?  Instead of going after sugary drinks?  I know.  This is getting to a point where people don't know how they can afford the subway system  and get in and out every day for their dumb jobs.  There's a stop over here.  I forget what line it is.  I think it's like the B or the D that goes downtown.  It consistently, for the last six months or whatever, it's consistently smelled like horse  shit.  Great.  It smells like, literally, I'm not saying, oh, it smells bad.  No.  It smells like actual shit in the subway station for months at a time.  So how are we having rate hikes because there's not enough money? 
[03:01:30]  You need to fix all that stuff before I'll contemplate another hike.  I'll tell you this much.  I've been living in New York now over 10 years already.  Subway system, they have the digital display now that tells you how long before you train.  Hold on.  And every once in a while, you get in an air-conditioned car.  That's the only difference in 10 years.  And those LED that tell you how far along the train is or whatever, it's very basic.  The information provided is very basic.  And what I thought was funny, it was brought up... 
[03:02:00]  They could have done that years ago is what I'm saying.  Yeah, but they wasted so much money because instead of having a dual-sided LED panel so  that you could have one panel with the information on both sides, it's not one panel.  They actually got two separate units and placed them back to back.  So basically, they doubled their cost on every single display throughout the entire  system.  I had no idea.  There you go, man.  You know, the more you know.  The more you know.  The more you know.  The time, what day it is, and maybe the six trains coming. 
[03:02:30]  The sugary drink thing just drives me insane.  Dude, it makes me sick.  Because I just think of all the other shit people deal with, and that's the one really...  Well, you know what?  That's the one you go after?  I want to see how this is going to affect packaging, because the 20-ounce soda is the most popular  soda.  You go into a store, you grab a 20-ounce soda.  Now, in New York City, you can't go into your 7-Eleven and grab a 20-ounce soda.  What do you grab?  Well, how about this?  If the mayor wants to show some fucking...  And I know that it's hard for her to show balls, but how about you just begin jacking... 
[03:03:00]  Maybe they do this, but how about if you're a certain weight, you pay more in insurance?  Oh, boy.  How about that?  Instead of punishing everybody...  That's discrimination.  But how about you directly penalize smokers?  Like, you know, you directly penalize people for being fat so that we do not always have  to pay the extra health cost for obesity.  How about that?  You want to show some fucking...  You want to get things done.  Don't punish the fucking product maker.  Take it away from everybody.  That's the mentality of the entire country with a lot of people. 
[03:03:30]  We don't like this, or I don't like this, and I don't want other people to have it because  it's dangerous or some people abuse it.  So take it away from everybody.  You're all children.  You're all just children.  You can't decide for yourself.  No, it's just cowardice by these people because Bloomberg does not want to have to face  fat people groups and be called discriminatory.  He's a coward.  Yep.  Imagine if we all had to pay car insurance, but people who drove, drove, and if you didn't  drive, you still had to pay it. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah, yeah.  No driver.  You don't drive, but you got to pay.  I think we can all agree there's a gun fucking problem in this city.  Absolutely.  You should fucking go after that instead of these sugary drinks.  Really?  Go after the guns, mayor.  How do these guys get all these guns anyway?  Yeah.  Oh, they're not legal?  Oh, oh.  Well, how do they become illegal?  Well, they buy them in Florida, and oh, the second they leave Florida, they become illegal?  Oh, I get it.  So you're constantly talking about illegal guns.  I fucking hate them all.  Yeah.  Just hate them all. 
[03:04:30]  They really are.  They're all so hateable.  I like Rudy.  And he was all proud.  What was it?  Thursday or Friday?  Oh, yeah.  I'm like, oh, this is embarrassing.  Well, it's embarrassing.  It passed, everybody.  Oh.  It's embarrassing.  You can't even get in a cab anymore unless you're really rich.  He just hated taking those giant bottles and shoving them up his ass.  He felt guilty the next day, so he wants none of them in the city.  Stick to a smaller bottle, shoved up his asshole.  He's the fucking worst.  But commute in and out of the city is ridiculous.  Dude, it's fucked up. 
[03:05:00]  Money-wise, traffic-wise, that's real problems that people want answers to.  A guy like me, I take the railroad, the Long Island Railroad, but I also got to take the  subway, too, because I got to get from Penn Station to here.  So, you know, I got to...  Dude, it costs a lot of money.  It costs...  And what do you think?  I don't have a car at home?  No.  I got a fucking car and gas and car insurance.  It fucking sucks.  You got a short ride in.  You don't do LIRR, do you?  Sure.  Of course.  So what is it a month?  Of course.  Well, I'm off-peak, so I'm lucky because these hours are retarded, so that helps. 
[03:05:30]  But it's...  Let's call it $70 a week.  Jesus.  No, a month.  Don't you get a month?  No, because it actually...  Because monthly people...  You're spending $70 a week just to get in here?  That's just the railroad.  That's what I'm trying to say, and obviously...  That's going to be another $5 a day if this rate goes up.  $5 a day on the subway as well.  And he just sits there going after sugary drinks when that's a real issue for people.  They can't afford that, you idiot.  It's a lot of monthly money.  $70 a week, that's...  So you're talking $280-ish? 
[03:06:00]  And then the subway fare on top of that.  Easily over $300 a month just to go to your job.  Just to be able to go to work and come home.  And your cost of living increase is here.  There's no way it can match that...  Oh.  By this company?  Did they give cost of living?  Oh, right.  No.  Cost of what?  What the fuck is Liberty taking over?  I'm more than ready to take my chance.  And I hope the guys down here, don't misconstrue this as a complaint.  It's not.  It's just that it costs a lot of money to live in New York City.  It just costs a lot of money.  If you want to live and work here, this is not Sioux City, Iowa. 
[03:06:30]  This is fucking New York, and it's very expensive.  So you're about $310-$320 a month when it's all said and done?  Easily.  And you've got a shorter commute.  Much shorter.  My commute's about an hour.  It's not the Irish commute.  It's about an hour door-to-door.  It is?  Yeah, I'm out in Massapequa now.  Oh!  You know, I keep thinking quick.  Okay, you're right.  Yeah, I'm out.  So you're about the average, more or less.  It's maybe, you know, maybe others are paying about $10 or $20 more a month than you.  So about $310 to $330 is what most, the average person is paying to get into this fucking city. 
[03:07:00]  More, more because I'm on an off-peak, so my fare is reduced because it's four in the morning train.  You know, these guys working nine to five hours, like, fuck, dude.  Peak.  So that's close to $400.  It's a lot.  I don't even know what it is.  It's an ungodly amount of pay.  People that live elsewhere, they can't, I bet you they're looking at the radios, they  can't believe this.  Yeah, people are spending just $400 just to get to their job a month.  Amazing.  Yeah.  Fucking ridiculous.  And he goes after sugary, dumb drinks.  And like we said today, the MTA is going up, the cabs just went up again. 
[03:07:30]  It's ridiculous.  Where does it end, for the love of God?  Well, that's why they're all hateable.  My goodness.  Because they don't really take care of anybody.  It's crazy is what it is.  It just seems like you spend more and you get less.  Whatever happened to value for your dollar?  They got you by the purse strings.  They sure do.  It's what they did.  Have you buy.  Have you buy.  Well, I think we did it for today.  Fuck it.  By the way, someone wants a correction.  I guess Yahoo has given all their employees the $12,500, a choice of phones, as they say 
[03:08:00]  bye-bye to BlackBerry.  But they're assuming, this article was assuming that most people would pick the iPhone 5.  But no, a bunch would pick the Galaxy S3 as well.  Well, I mean, it's accurate.  They're offering it.  That doesn't mean they need to take it.  Right.  But Yahoo's offering them.  That's a nice thing for a company to do.  Sure is.  12,000 of them.  It's a lot.  Right.  This Friday and Saturday, I'll be in Columbus at the Funny Bone, September 21, 22. 
[03:08:30]  And then...  Where's that Minnesota date?  That's almost sold out.  That's November 3rd.  There was less than 100 tickets left as of Friday.  I'm looking at my calendar thinking, hmm, I would love to go to Minnesota.  That's going to be a totally, completely sold out show.  I've never been there.  October 25, 26, 27, I'm kind of...  The first time I've ever done a comedy club in Philly, I'm doing Helium, HeliumComedyClub.com  or HeliumComedy.com in Philly, 25, 26, 27 of October.  I'm looking forward to that, because every comic is like, it's a great gig, it's a great  gig, and I've never done... 
[03:09:00]  I've done like 10-minute spots there, but I've never done full...  And I have a Buffalo date coming soon.  Yeah, Helium, they do a good job down there.  Yes.  Yeah, I haven't been to Buffalo in a couple of years.  Buffalo.  Oh.  I'd love to have mediocre crowds there, too.  Oh, I forgot a date with a Buffalo.  Oh, Jimmy.  You beat yourself up.  No, I don't.  Realistic, when it's sold out, it's great.  When it's not, it's not.  When he said that he sells out in 52 countries, would that just hurt your soul?  No, if he was a comic, it would.  But as a rock star, like as one of the rock icons, it doesn't bother me. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah, we're doing it in Indonesia.  Well, almost sold out.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  No, but when I hear just comedians...  This is what drives me crazy.  And I'm going to start canceling dates when people aren't buying tickets.  Because people are like, come to our city!  Come to our city!  And then if I book a date in your city and it doesn't sell, that's fine.  But that's why I don't honor a lot of requests.  So you guys that ask me to come to the city, if I'm going to come and you're not going to buy tickets,  I'm just going to start canceling the fucking dates. 
[03:10:00]  I'm not going to go and embarrass myself.  Yeah, you've got to be careful.  Yeah.  I won't do it.  Because there are enough places where you do very, very well.  Yeah, but they keep asking, when are you coming, when are you coming?  And it's like, you're asking me on Twitter what I've announced on Twitter.  So either read the tweets or stop fucking asking.  Yeah, stop being an asshole.  Ugh, it fucking annoys me.  Utter irrelevance, this business.  Sick of it.  Really, it's fucking like you do a special.  It means nothing.  It means nothing. 
[03:10:30]  That's why I'm never just happy to do shit.  Like, it doesn't mean anything to me.  Like, it's great to do Fallon or Leno or fucking Atrium.  Nothing means nothing.  Nothing happens.  No, but that's why I'm never excited.  Like, I can't wait to go home and watch it.  Who gives a fuck?  That's why I don't.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  That's why I don't.  Aren't you just proud for yourself, though?  No.  No, no.  When we get a little Jimmy Fallon action or like a Leno or Letterman, I'm like, hey,  this is kind of cool.  No, because it's my job.  It's part of my job.  Yeah, man.  It's like, I would be proud of myself if it showed the result.  Like, if you did stuff like that, people see it. 
[03:11:00]  It's not like they don't see it, but it doesn't move them to want to come.  So, me doing it, yeah, it was fun to do and I loved doing it, but it's not changing anything.  So, no, but I'm just saying it's fucking frustrating and it's irritating.  So, that's why.  One of these days it might, though.  Yeah, but you know what?  It's like, enough for it.  People who know me, know me.  Yeah.  That's it.  They fucking, I'm 44.  I'm not 33 years old.  They know me.  Really?  Yes.  You're 33.  I look younger.  Thank you.  Exactly like you looked back in what I call the day. 
[03:11:30]  Did you see, maybe I shouldn't turn you on to this, Louis CK, I'm catching up and Gary  Marshall plays the head of CBS.  I don't watch any, I love Louis, but no, I have not seen any of it.  And basically, Louis kills on Leno and he had to take over because Tom Cruise didn't show  up.  So, Louis had to do a longer set for Jay and he killed.  So, CBS is going, holy fuck.  So, they get him into his office and Gary Marshall's the head of CBS, basically offering  him Letterman's job. 
[03:12:00]  Even though they have Seinfeld on the back burner for 13 million, they're trying to get  Louis cheaper to save money for the network.  And as Louis's sitting there, Gary Marshall does this monologue about the comedian.  Holy fuck.  You got it.  We should play it on the air, actually.  Maybe we play it tomorrow.  Well, I already know the whole storyline for that particular, you know.  Oh, well.  Are you in that?  I'm not saying I'm in it or not.  I'm just going to happen to be aware of the whole...  Isn't it a three, that's three episodes?  It is a three-parter.  And you're in that?  Maybe.  I don't know.  So, you know what I'm talking about. 
[03:12:30]  Maybe I don't know.  No, I didn't read the script.  Gary Marshall...  I'm a coy, Jimmy.  Gary Marshall gave Louis C.K. an amazing fucking...  Oh, you saw it, Travis?  Yes.  Amazing performance.  And you wonder why Gary Marshall never really did major acting.  Obviously, you know, he's a producer and made a shitload of money, but that guy could fucking  act.  And you wonder how...  Because he hasn't been in much, right?  No.  No.  A little guest spot here and there on some of those old sitcoms and all, but he never really  did anything.  But the way Louis works is he may have written the script or he may have said just to talk 
[03:13:00]  about it because he's weird.  Like, he's smart at letting you kind of...  Explore a little bit?  A lot, actually.  Okay.  Which is why his show is so good and why it's so successful because it has a really different...  And again, the moments I've seen of it and just the scripts I've read, he allows you  to fucking...  He off-roads a little bit.  He'll just film you talking and he'll just take the best of it.  He's smart like that.  But Gary Marshall got into Louis' head about, you know, how a comedian thinks when he's  like in his early 40s and what he's thinking in his head. 
[03:13:30]  It was really, wow.  Well, well done.  We should play it tomorrow if most people have seen it.  Well...  Seen that episode.  Hopefully, he said that you begin to feel like a failure.  Oh, no.  And that it's been a futile...  Just a futile effort.  And then you're hanging in there thinking it's going to change.  Right.  So then you hang in there for four years and then eventually you're teaching a stand-up  comedy course at a community college.  I'm like, wow!  That's brutal.  And Louis is just sitting there listening because he knows what he's saying to his character 
[03:14:00]  is exactly how he's thinking.  And the agents never want you...  Like, I've had to beat Jonathan up, my manager...  Like, not physically.  Like, to stop telling me people are fans.  Like, Jonathan...  Like, he's a nice guy.  And people will go, like, we love Jim.  And I'm like, if you tell me that again, I'm going to fucking put a knife in you.  Because you know what people...  You know who loved me?  People at HBO at one point loved me.  You know how I knew?  Because they used me.  You know, that's how you know people love you.  Because they fucking hire you.  Or they come to see you. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  They don't use you.  Comedy show, Jim, they're fans.  Shut up!  I'm a Sabbath fan.  You know how you know that?  Shut up!  Because I go to see Sabbath.  I buy Sabbath's records.  If I had a fucking network, I would employ Black Sabbath.  But if I had a network, I would not say I'm a Sabbath fan and tell...  We love Sabbath.  And if you only...  The other thing we're having trouble putting together.  If you only fucking knew how repulsive this business is.  How people pretend to be loyal. 
[03:15:00]  This has nothing to do with me personally.  And they pretend to love people.  And they pretend to fucking be fans of certain comedians.  But man, when it's time to pay tribute, nobody wants to fucking know nothing.  Oh, this fucking business is filled with scumbags.  Yeah.  Filled with them.  Will you tell the story someday?  Yeah.  Okay.  I just don't want to self...  Again, this is not about me.  Mm-hmm.  This is about something else that is disconnected from me.  But if you only knew what fucking pieces of garbage people are behind the scenes. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, they're fucking cunts.  It's funny, the whole, he's a fan.  We've heard that over the years with some of these celebrities that come in.  Big fan.  And then you want some kind of acknowledgement that he's a fan.  Because this person will tell you, oh, my guy is a big fan.  He can't wait to do your show.  And then he sits there.  And you can tell he doesn't even know who is who.  Yeah.  And has no concept who we are.  We're just another radio show they're doing.  Yeah.  I'm like, holy fuck.  We were lied to our faces. 
[03:16:00]  This guy's a fan.  Are you kidding me?  Shut it.  You find the part?  Yeah.  Let's play this.  Man, look at that.  Let me set up.  Oh, you set it up.  Yeah, because instead of playing the long fucking clip.  Yeah, you want to set up this clip in any way?  Yeah, because, I mean, it's a seven-minute clip.  But so basically, he's been asked.  We're not playing the whole seven minutes.  Don't worry.  He's been asked by Gary Marshall if he wants to host the, if he wants to take over for  Letterman.  Louie says no.  He says you should get somebody like Jerry Seinfeld.  He says we're negotiating with Jerry Seinfeld.  And now he's kind of thinking about it again. 
[03:16:30]  But he basically said, you know, Jerry wants $13 million a year.  And Gary Marshall, right to Louie's face, goes, we know we could get you for a million.  Maybe less.  He goes, and maybe even less.  So now he's asking Louie.  Like just mind games.  What he's thinking.  And then he gives his.  Yeah, here it is.  You're thinking.  I see the wheels turning.  Tell, tell me.  What?  Well, I just never saw this.  I didn't see this coming.  I don't know.  I don't know how much you know about me.  I know you're a working class stand-up from Boston. 
[03:17:00]  You do stand-up.  You make maybe $80,000 a year on the club dates.  But you're on the back none of your career.  Except for once in a while a special on table.  I think five years ago you probably peaked.  And now you're waiting around wondering if something's going to happen before it gets embarrassing.  Oh.  Am I right?  Holy shit.  That's brutal. 
[03:17:30]  You don't think you could do it.  You think it's over and you're afraid to try.  I mean, I get it.  That's normal.  I've seen it.  And I've seen it turn around.  Let me offer you a proposal.  You go back to New York.  You get in shape.  You lose about 40 pounds.  I get you with Jackie Dahl.  He's my main city man.  He works with you.  And then in about two months we do a test show. 
[03:18:00]  A test show?  Jack will get you a small studio.  You know, you'll do a monologue.  You'll do a couple of interviews.  And if the test is good, I'll put you on the air.  And then if you're a hit, everybody will think I'm a genius.  And I'll have saved the network about 12 million dollars.  If America hates you, no one's going to blame me. 
[03:18:30]  We'll hire Jerry Seinfeld to do the show.  No harm, no foul.  But you'll take the heat on all that.  You're going to crack your head on the ceiling and you're going to go down.  Probably for good.  Look, Louie.  We're talking about the big game here.  So forgive me if I use big terms.  Here's the reality.  In 10 years, you're going to be teaching comedy at a community college to support your kids. 
[03:19:00]  And falling asleep to the late show with Jerry Seinfeld.  You're circling failure in a rapidly decaying orbit.  That's the reality as we talk now.  But you can change that.  It's in your power to change that.  Yes, you'll have to work hard.  You'll have to do things you haven't done before. 
[03:19:30]  And still, your chances are very slim.  But you could change it.  I'm going to ask you one more time.  David Letterman is retiring.  You want his job?  How fucking great is that?  That little kid is hilarious.  How great is that?  That's good, man.  And I'm not even going to blow what the answer is. 
[03:20:00]  Oh, you.  How great is that?  Fantastic.  Gary Marshall.  Holy fuck.  You know who he reminds me of.  You know what?  I've always thought that, too.  Something tells me he wasn't totally acting there.  He's probably given that speech so many times to people.  You know, you're probably right.  He probably came up with rapidly decaying orbit.  Orbit.  It's good.  Yeah.  He said that once to the guy who played the big ragu.  Yeah, I'm giving him credit for being an actor, but he knows that world. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah.  But how great was that?  That monologue gave me chills last night.  I was like, holy fuck, man.  It was great.  And, you know, like you said, Louis using the kid for his agent is classic.  It makes no sense.  Yeah, he's great.  But it's fucking, it works.  Yeah.  All right, enough kissing Louis' fucking ass.  Yeah.  Oh, did you hear Anthony today?  Louis.  Louis Beans.  Yeah. 
[03:21:00]  Louis Beans.  Am I caught up to Louis, or is there another one on demand after this one?  Did you watch the one after that?  No.  Okay, then.  I got one more to do.  So do I.  Before Thursday.  I haven't seen that one yet either.  And then what?  Thursday is the.  Then Thursday, I think, is the.  It was the finale.  I don't know if it's the.  I don't know if it's the season finale.  Of the three show arc.  Yes.  Or whatever they call it.  All right, guys.  It's a three episode arc.  Three episode arc.  I should have said that.  We're not in the know.  All right.  Anyway, let's.  No.  All right.  That's some other shit. 
[03:21:30]  Steve Blatter, we went 13 minutes late today. </pre>
