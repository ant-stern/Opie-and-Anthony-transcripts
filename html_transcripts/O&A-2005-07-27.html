<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts, Opie and Jim Norton, engaging in their usual brand of profanity-laced insults directed at each other and their staff, Ben and Steve.  Technical difficulties with Norton's microphone provided extended comedic fodder. Norton recounted a three-hour post-show nap followed by viewing *The Machinist* and *March of the Penguins*, providing graphic and humorous commentary on penguin mating habits.  A caller's mention of a *Good Times* marathon sparked a lengthy and offensively racist discussion about the show's portrayal of Black families, including a replay of an earlier Opie and Anthony bit about Opie's attraction to a *Good Times* character, and the playing of a song by Opie about his preference for Black women.  The discussion included a caller’s suggestion that Opie had a crush on Florida from *Good Times*. The segment transitioned to a sarcastic discussion of the Space Shuttle Discovery's launch, focusing on falling debris and NASA's response. Mark Zupan, star of *Murderball*, then called in.

Zupan discussed his paralyzing accident at 18, his reconciliation with the drunk driver (now dubbed "The Quadfather"), and the creation of a website documenting their friendship. He detailed adapting to life in a wheelchair, discovering wheelchair rugby, and his perspective on his disability, including his refusal of a cure.  He also addressed the physicality and misconceptions surrounding wheelchair rugby, and the sexual aspects of life after paralysis, referencing a graphic video in the film.  The hosts also discussed *Murderball*, its humor, and the personalities of its players.  The conversation shifted to their experiences at Ozzfest, including chaotic backstage access, interactions with security, exhaustion, and humorous anecdotes, particularly one involving Steve's bowel movements.  Audio clips from Ozzfest interviews with fans and musicians (including members of Black Sabbath and Zakk Wylde) were played.  Bill Burr and Paul Provenza were announced as upcoming studio guests. The show included mention of a recurring comedic segment featuring the character "Ramon".

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a rambling, repeatedly interrupted, and expletive-filled discussion about a vaguely described incident involving Jim Norton and a dress.  This discussion continued even during an interview with Zakk Wylde, whose responses were largely overshadowed by the hosts' obsession with the "dress" incident.  The show also included listener calls, one featuring a woman faking moans for Def Leppard tickets, and a discussion of an XM radio deal with Napster.  Further Ozzfest interviews with Bill Ward and Tony Iommi were interspersed with listener calls and discussion of the Ozzfest experience, including PSAs recorded with various bands and comments on reality TV.  A bit involving a "drown the clown" routine was also mentioned.

A later segment focused on two main events: a street performance where the hosts offensively taunted strangers using racial slurs and other offensive language, and a discussion of *The Aristocrats*.  The hosts found the obnoxious laughter of one of their targets hilarious and wanted to sample it.  Bill Burr, in studio, discussed his involvement with the *Aristocrats* joke and film.  The segment also included details about the “Assault on the Media” contest winner, Tim from Springfield, Mass., who recounted his experience interrupting a news report in an Opie and Anthony shirt and cape.  A phone call with Paul Provenza, director of *The Aristocrats*, followed, discussing the film's creation, the controversy surrounding its unrated status (especially with AMC), and the diverse comedians involved.  The discussion included mentions of numerous comedians (George Carlin, Bob Saget, Phyllis Diller) and the joke's history, including a *South Park* Cartman version.

The final segment also focused on *The Aristocrats*. With Paul Provenza in studio, the discussion centered on the film's graphic content, public reaction, and the hypocrisy of societal sensitivities towards explicit language versus violence.  Provenza read increasingly explicit excerpts from a Radar Magazine article detailing variations of the joke.  The conversation touched upon movie ratings, audience reactions to 9/11 humor (mentioning Gilbert Gottfried), and Provenza's experiences with international stand-up.  The segment concluded with plans for Andrew Dice Clay to read more from the Radar article and a possible future call with Bob Saget.  A Gamefly.com advertisement was also aired.

[00:00:00]  Oh 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  You're a fine bunch of bullies, aren't you?  I'm Opie.  I could give a fuck.  I'm Jim Norton, and I'm on the radio.  Shut up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's all about fun, fun, fun.  I'd love to spit in your face.  I will fucking kill you.  Shut up, stupid.  I'm just a zelch and I know it.  Who cares?  We're trying to do a fucking radio show.  I know what we're trying to do.  I'm sitting here across from you.  I understand that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Despicable asshat.  And these dummies at work for us.  You guys stink.  Ben looks like a tall baby. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, he's laughing in the wrong places.  Ben, where's the quality?  He rocks.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you stink.  You are cordially invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  I think the show is a disaster.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  If you have any poo, sing it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I love that one.  I love that new open. 
[00:04:30]  He did a great job at that.  I'm Jim Norton and I'm on the radio.  My favorite line out of it.  Hey, how do you become a radio DJ?  Say the name of the station over and over.  Play at least a half hour of commercials.  Broadcast live from the quickie mons.  Mix lots of sounds together.  Talk on and on about how you invented radio.  Don't spread.  Play the same songs again and again and again and again. 
[00:05:00]  Commercial radio, we're coming to get you.  You're listening to the future of radio.  Satellite radio.  XM satellite radio.  You're damn straight.  At this point, there's only one company.  Truly one company doing this right.  One company.  Under God.  Indivisible.  And this is the O&A show.  It's a virus.  Trust me.  It's a virus. 
[00:05:30]  Am I up at the proper volume?  Because again, kind of odd.  Can you give me a mic test, Anthony?  I can't really.  Test one, two.  All right.  I got you at minus ten.  Very hard to hear.  That's better.  Right there.  I got you at a minus ten PGM.  That's all it took.  That's all it took was a little boost up.  Now things are fine.  Yeah, I got you at minus six PGMs now.  Minus six PGM?  Yeah, that should work.  You're sure minus six PGM is good?  All right.  I'm thinking minus six to minus four is where you need to be. 
[00:06:00]  Jimmy, he's the problem.  I've been talking to him when we're not on the air about his mic technique, and he's getting better.  He's been down near minus 20 PGM at times.  I talk all over the place.  It's hard for me to sit still.  I'm just an antsy little fella.  He's got it closer when we painted it black and glistened the head a little bit.  Now he's right on it.  It's when you put the hand hanging off the back so I can kind of feel it near my head.  Big rubber hand off the mic stand that pushes the back of his head. 
[00:06:30]  Did we even do a radio show yesterday?  I have no recollection of yesterday's program.  There are days that I walk around here like a zombie, and I realize later on in the day,  oh yeah, we broadcast it to the entire country.  Yeah, and I have no clue.  I don't remember yesterday's show.  I don't remember.  I remember waking up in my computer chair so I could get up and lay down on the couch and go to sleep once I got home.  That's pretty much it. 
[00:07:00]  I did a three-hour nap.  I'm usually good for like a half hour, 40 minutes after the show.  Yeah.  Three hours.  I try to stay up so I don't ruin my night's sleep because if I sleep for three hours,  I'm up until 12, 1 in the morning, and it starts the vicious cycle.  This time slept three hours on the couch, and when I did go to bed, boom, right out.  I cannot deal with the hours.  The weekend just screws up my schedule and exhausted yesterday.  Yeah.  I had a weird day after the show. 
[00:07:30]  Went home, slept three hours, and then I woke up and watched The Machinist.  I love that movie.  You suggested that movie to me.  Yes.  Good one.  Christian Bale.  I got it on demand.  I love my movies on demand.  I love that feature.  Isn't it fantastic?  It's unbelievable.  The best part?  To sit there.  In your home.  I'm not a big fan when I'm home to watch a movie all the way through.  I'm just not.  Why is that?  I don't know.  I like to watch it in halves.  It's really weird.  You're like...  I watch like the first hour, and then usually I crash, and then with this movies on demand, 
[00:08:00]  you get the movie for like 24 hours.  Yeah, then you can watch the rest of it.  With the rewind feature, you know the deal.  Yep.  And then I continue watching my movie.  It's great.  I can't do that.  I have to finish watching it.  I could get through a lot more movies that way, it seems.  Yeah.  And so I watched the second half of The Machinist, and man, you were right.  That movie's fucked up.  It is.  Really a freaky movie.  Christian Bale.  He lost what?  I don't know.  Like 50, 60 pounds for the movie.  He was emaciated.  He looked ridiculous. 
[00:08:30]  So skinny.  I know they were using makeup as far as really accentuating the ribs and stuff.  They fill in a little dark in between him and his spine and stuff like that.  But you can't, through CGI or anything else, cut out pieces of a human like that.  He lost that much weight.  And it wouldn't be so amazing if it wasn't for the fact that his next movie was Batman,  where he's, you know, a workout, he's all pumped up and everything.  Right.  How the hell do you do that? 
[00:09:00]  Well, they showed him as a fatter guy in The Machinist as well.  Yeah.  And it was just, it was an interesting movie.  I mean, Christian Bale basically slowly but surely going crazy over something that happened to him.  And then they kind of weave that in through the movie.  They bring it all together at the end, but yeah, his weight loss for the movie was just amazing.  Definitely a recommend.  It was kind of a creepy movie.  And then I got all set and ready to go for my March of the Penguins. 
[00:09:30]  Whoa!  You saw March of the Penguins.  Well, we talked about it on the show so much, I figured, you know, one of us has to go and see it.  You're like Mr. Documentary these days.  You are Mr. Documentary.  You went to go see Murderball.  Murderball was awesome.  Murderball was awesome.  And we're going to have Mark Zupin on today, the star of Murderball.  And I thought when I talked about Murderball the first time, about two, three weeks ago now, maybe two weeks ago,  I was surprised because usually you throw something out there and then the phones, you know, start ringing like crazy  and people want to comment about the shit we talk about, right? 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Murderball, not one phone call.  And it turns out that it hasn't really been released to the rest of the country yet.  Only in selective theaters in like New York, probably L.A. and a couple other big cities.  That's it.  But I guess they're now going to release this thing all over the place.  So we're going to talk to Mark Zupin about that today.  But yeah, then I saw March of the Penguins yesterday and it was...  Was it inspiring?  It was interesting.  Did it make you laugh and make you cry like the movie says?  Made me laugh, made me cry. 
[00:10:30]  Were you weeping over the little penguins?  Made me think.  Made me think that I would be an awful parent because my egg would roll out and just freeze to death.  Is that what every nature show you watch when they're having the kids,  when their little animals are having their eggs or babies or something,  it's never just a happy scene where everyone has their little babies and everything goes well.  There's always the couple that they have to show, the little animal couple that's just... 
[00:11:00]  Not fit to be parents.  Not fit to be parents.  It didn't pan out.  There's some vulture diving down and grabbing its young.  There's always something.  I, as you know, obviously, I have a dark sense of humor.  And parts of that movie where I actually saw, you know, people crying.  A lot of old people are watching March of the Penguins for some reason.  I guess they have nothing else to do during the day.  And there were times during the movie that, obviously, they were tugging at your heartstrings. 
[00:11:30]  And inside, I wanted to laugh so fucking hard because it just is funny to me.  And the old people are all weeping.  Basically, the March of the Penguins is a movie about the emperor penguins or whatever.  Yeah.  And they live their lives in the water, eating their fish and stuff and avoiding the lion seals or the sea lions and all that crap.  Yeah.  And then it's time to mate.  So they just know, you know, it's that time of year to mate.  So they all come out of the water and march 70 miles to their mating area. 
[00:12:00]  Now, why can't they just screw where they are?  That's what I was trying to figure out.  I don't get these wacky, instinctual things that these animals have to do to fuck.  They explain it because the winter is so harsh.  You know, the surroundings where they mate, it's covered.  So it protects them a little better from the elements.  Oh, gotcha.  And also, let's see, I'm going to explain this to you.  Thank you.  The ice is a lot thicker in that area. 
[00:12:30]  Ice is thicker.  Because, you know, they're going to be there for a while when the spring thaw happens or the summer thaw or whatever.  Because their seasons were all messed up.  They started marching in, like, March.  Well, that makes perfect sense.  But that was the beginning of winter.  Yeah.  Because they live way down there.  The South Pole.  So I guess, what, winter starts in March down there?  Yeah, south of the equator, winter is our summer and vice versa. 
[00:13:00]  So they march 70 miles to this area, and the ice is a lot thicker when it starts thawing.  You know, they don't want their young falling through the ice, of course.  So they march, which is the creepiest thing.  They walk like humans.  And they did a great job filming it because, you know, they show them from a distance,  and they look like aliens or something because, you know, it's pretty creepy down there to begin with.  How many did they say do this?  Oh, my God.  They just showed thousands and thousands.  Really?  Just all walking?  Yeah, walking.  A little penguin waddle walk? 
[00:13:30]  Walking, and they have to walk 70 miles to their mating area, right?  70 miles.  And they show the lazy ones that decide, ah, they're going to hang out in the water for a few more weeks or days,  and they're way behind.  And they show them and basically say, well, these are not going to make it.  Not going to cut it.  They started their march a little too late.  Because it's all a timing thing, you know?  And they basically said, these will not make it to the mating area.  See, every animal is just like humans.  There's still a lazy motherfucker that won't leave. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, that's exactly the point I was getting at.  I just started laughing because inside, you know, I didn't want to wreck the movie for others because in my real life I try to be a human being.  But I'm laughing inside going, God, just like you said, this is just like regular...  Real people would do the same thing and have the majority doing what they got to do, and the few stragglers would just end up dead.  Did you find that the lazy ones didn't have that white thing painted in the middle?  Anyway, so then they get to the mating area. 
[00:14:30]  Painted.  I know, what the fuck, Tim?  Like they take a little roller and just paint their little bellies.  So they march to 70 miles.  Yeah.  And now they have to choose a mate.  How do they do that?  Because I know usually in the animal world it's a pretty elaborate thing that they do to get their mate.  They're just marching around trying to figure it out, and they just kind of pair up. 
[00:15:00]  And then eventually in this movie they show this whole mess of penguins all of a sudden all paired up nice.  They're all paired up.  All paired up nice.  Out of nowhere, they just decided to pick somebody, and that's who they're mating with.  I forget what they said about that, but then all of a sudden they're...  There's got to be a criteria for each one, why they're with a certain mate and why they didn't pick that one.  I don't think they got into that as much, but the females do fight over the males  because there's a lot more females than males, I guess.  And they showed that, which was really funny. 
[00:15:30]  Hilarious, actually.  Making noises at each other.  Oh, yeah.  They do a wacky little pose and go...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just freaking out.  It's a penguin.  So then they show...  This is where it was kind of a...  This is where the movie's kind of a downer in a way.  Aw.  Because they're obviously going for the kid audience as well.  You know, they're going to show the penguins having sex, but they barely show it. 
[00:16:00]  Really?  They barely show it.  No banging.  It looks like they like the old...  The old doggy style.  Oh, really?  Is that how they were doing it?  One penguin standing straight up and the other one kind of...  Hunched over a bit?  On all...  Pretty much on her belly.  Really?  Pretty much on her belly.  And the gentleman penguin just kind of struts up behind and...  Waddles in and out, I guess.  Jams it in.  Mm-hmm.  And then...  That's got to look silly.  And then they even say, you know, if it's done right, there's an egg, right? 
[00:16:30]  Uh-huh.  And the egg is...  They show the egg.  And now the egg has...  Just one egg?  Yeah, one egg.  One egg.  The female has the egg there.  And now the female has to pass the egg onto the male.  I had no idea about this.  They pass it to the male.  And they practice because it's way down there and it's way cold.  So if the egg is exposed for too long, they're saying, like, if it's exposed more than a few seconds, done. 
[00:17:00]  This egg will not hatch in the spring.  It'll freeze?  It'll freeze.  So the penguins instinctively know to practice the move of passing the egg.  What do they practice with?  Well, they're just like...  They line up and bump into each other and...  Front to front?  Yeah, front to front.  And they kind of roll the egg from, you know, their little penguin feet to the other penguin feet.  Is this the type of penguin, because I've seen other nature shows, where they kind of have the egg on top of their little feet?  Yes.  And they can kind of waddle with the egg a little bit and then they sit down on it? 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, that's the weird thing.  The feet of the penguin is the nest.  Right.  Okay, so the female passes the egg over to the male, you know, penguin.  And he's supposed to put it right on his feet and squat down on it.  And stay like that for 125 days, waddling around, making sure the egg does not fall from its penguin feet.  Now, who brings him food?  Well, this is where it gets interesting.  The reason the female penguin is passing it to the male penguin...  Yeah.  ...is so she could march the 70 miles back to where she could get back into the ocean. 
[00:18:00]  So she leaves.  She leaves and goes back another 70 miles to go feed and have fun for, I forget how long, like maybe up to a month or whatever.  I'm trying to remember.  Maybe three months.  I don't know.  And then the male is stuck in the cold with the rest of the male penguins with the egg on its feet as the nest, waiting for spring.  Keeping it warm.  Trying to keep it warm and trying to keep themselves warm.  And they're starving to death because they will not eat for 125 days. 
[00:18:30]  No one brings them food?  Well, no.  No, no, no.  She just sits there without eating for that long.  For 125 days.  How is that at all possible?  With winter just pounding you.  Don't they have little penguin interns to bring them a bagel?  Nothing.  Or an apple that they can throw at them?  You can get flippers off the fork, would you?  But then, so the female passes the egg to the male penguin, right?  And most of them do it flawlessly. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  But they showed a few couples that just stink.  Oh, no.  There's always the ones.  And it's basically just rolling the egg.  They're a foot apart tops.  Rolling the egg.  And then the male grabs it.  And that's it.  Done.  Done.  And all of a sudden they show like one penguin rolling it.  And all of a sudden it just rolls off to the side.  And then they both just stare at it.  Because they know it's just over, Johnny.  Now it's just over.  And they're just losers.  That is so sad. 
[00:19:30]  It got a big laugh from me inside.  And a lot of people started crying at that point.  And then Morgan Freeman, who does a great job with the narration.  And he's like, well, their job is done here.  So now they just walk back to the ocean.  There's no reason.  Good job, asshole.  There's no reason to be in this area anymore.  Do you think there's blame in the animal world?  Do you think they're walking back 70 miles that either she's nagging at him 
[00:20:00]  or he's popping her in the face or just something?  I told you I was passing it.  I told you.  Wait a second.  Good eyes, asshole.  But that's where I started laughing.  Because they do look kind of human.  When the egg rolls off, the penguin is just looking down.  They stare at it like.  All depressed.  The walk, the sitting here, everything.  Nothing.  It starts whining.  All for naught.  All for nothing.  He's probably the lucky one, though.  He doesn't have to put up with the kid.  He got to drop the load.  Here you go.  He probably did it on purpose.  Oops.  Dropped the egg. 
[00:20:30]  That's like us humans call it the old kick down the stairs.  The old foot comes out when she's walking by the stairwell.  The old whoops-a-daisy.  The old Doc Martin to the gut.  So that's what made me laugh hard.  Because then they show the elements just split the egg open immediately.  Because it's very, very, very fragile.  Can't you go over and get it?  What's the problem?  Just go get the fucking egg.  I explained to you, Jimmy.  I know it's only a second.  If it's exposed for more, yeah. 
[00:21:00]  It's exposed too long, and they just know that it's already dead.  So then the ones that are able to pass the egg successfully, now the male, that's where  it's a drag.  They have to stand there for 125 fucking days, not eating, freezing their asses off.  They all just go into one big huddle.  And that's how they spend 125 days.  That's ridiculous.  It's four months.  Yeah, it's a long time.  And the weird thing is, eventually, the parents and the kid will all just go their own ways. 
[00:21:30]  Like, there's not even what's called a family.  Yeah.  It doesn't exist.  There's no family after that.  No, as soon as the young'uns are old enough to jump in the ocean themselves or whatever,  the water there.  They just go, never see each other again.  That's what they say in the documentary.  They'll pretty much never see each other again.  So it's like, all that effort, and what's the payoff in the end, you know?  There are some families that would invite that.  Exactly.  Enough of you.  So the females march back, and they just, like, get nice and fat.  And then the males, they don't really, they don't eat for 125 days, but they store some 
[00:22:00]  weird crap in their mouths, because when the kid is born, because the kid is born while  the male is, uh, they spit it up.  Yeah, they pretty much open their mouths, and the young'uns, their feed.  That's great shit from three, four months ago in his mouth.  All plaqued.  Trying to eat, he's got plaqued breath.  So then, uh, then they show the female penguins just having a good old time in the water,  just, I mean, there's so much food, it's not even funny, getting nice and fat. 
[00:22:30]  And then when they feel like they decide to march back now to where the males are with  the, uh, with now the little hatchlings, you know, they're just going to hatch like  crazy, and, uh, you see the females over the horizon finally coming back, and now the  males lose their freaking minds.  Males get to leave?  Oh, they start screaming and yelling.  They're making that penguin sound.  They're very happy.  Of course they are.  And then, uh, the males, because, you know, they don't have much fur on them, they pass  the young ones back to the females, and now the males' job is done. 
[00:23:00]  Seventy miles.  And they now go the seventy miles back to the ocean.  After not eating for four months, they've got to walk seventy miles.  Yeah, and they basically say some of these guys will never make it.  You know, they just won't make it.  Penguins stink.  Snap man from a whack bag.  In one week, Opie went from, what the hell is March of the Penguins, to I love this penguin  movie.  I didn't say I loved it.  It was, uh, I don't know.  It's better than the garbage that's in the regular theaters for the most part, you know?  It was good.  It was interesting. 
[00:23:30]  But there were a lot of laughs.  A lot of laughs.  And then the young ones, they're running around all cute, right?  And then they showed the birds coming.  Oh, what?  Uh, the predators.  Predator birds.  And then there's one...  Eating the babies.  Oh, this one nasty bird.  They never all make it, do they?  This one nasty bird is just nibbling away at the little baby penguins' necks.  And this is where they cleaned it up, because they know they're going to have a lot of kids  going to see the movie.  They don't really show the bird just pretty much snapping the little penguin's neck. 
[00:24:00]  Little penguin neck.  They kind of play the audio in the background, where it's just awful.  You just know it's just horrific.  What, little screams?  Little penguin screams?  You know, it's just horrific.  And then they show the rest of the penguins, just make them believe they're not seeing  that and ignoring what's going on over there.  Penguins aren't known as being, like, the tough guy of the nature world.  No.  Not really the tough guy.  So, there you go.  I figured someone had to go see this movie.  We were talking about it for a week. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  But it was good.  And then I was seeing previews for all sorts of other movies, and I'm like, why don't  I go to, like, these artsy movie theaters more often?  The movies seem a little more interesting than going to see, like, Bad News Bears or, I don't  know.  I can't take a steady diet of the artsy-fartsy movies.  No.  Well, Murderball was cool, and that was just in the arts.  No, I think that was in a regular theater, actually.  You're just the documentary king now.  Did you hear that new penguin movie they're making, where at the end they have a match 
[00:25:00]  and a crop duster with gas and flies over and takes care of all that noise?  Of that, I'd pay money to see.  Hey, Justin on Long Island.  What's up, Justin?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Hey, Jimmy.  He forgot to tell you the best part of the movie.  Which is?  The daddy penguin, once they do that walk, after they get pregnant, he takes the mommy  penguin fishing, and all of a sudden he comes back by himself, and he does the walk back  with this masseuse penguin. 
[00:25:30]  Punching out, boys.  All right.  Very good, buddy.  So there you have it.  Was she his masseuse?  Scott Peterson, is that what he met?  Amber Frye?  I didn't know that.  Was she?  Jackie, New Jersey.  What's up?  Hello, boys.  Hi.  Opie, did you see the Good Times Marathon on TV Land this weekend?  Did they really have a Good Times Marathon?  I spent my weekend watching the Good Times Marathon.  Opie, 48 hours of it, 96 episodes, about 500 exclamations of James! 
[00:26:00]  James!  It was so, I hadn't watched Good Times an entire episode in a long, long time.  This was a marathon, so I watched quite a few episodes in a row.  That show was awful.  Just horrible.  There was nothing funny about it.  Until you watch about five or six episodes, then it starts becoming funny because it's so bad. 
[00:26:30]  The catchphrases, just the storylines, they were all, I can't even not say it, niggers.  It was, let me say, Jimmy.  What the hell's wrong with you?  And this is why John Amos left the goddamn show.  Because it was just this stereotypical, awful portrayal of a black family. 
[00:27:00]  Horrid.  Not funny at all.  And just storylines about, you know, a wino that they bring into the house, and drugs, and  J.J.'s always stealing stuff.  This is all the stuff I forgot.  They had a, remember Walona, the neighbor that lived next door?  She had a husband named Ray, who left her, of course, and comes back a few years later  and tries to get back with her, and says that he's changed. 
[00:27:30]  Well, he's got to come in and wait for Walona to get back, because the horror is she's out  with the rest of the Evans family.  And what's her name there?  The daughter?  What the hell was her name?  Thelma?  Thelma.  She's at home doing her homework.  Ray comes in.  What happens?  Ray just pretty much attacks her as she's doing her homework.  She's trying to do her work, and he's like, hey, how you doing?  Gets right up behind her.  Come on, baby!  In his pimp attire.  He's just like a pimp. 
[00:28:00]  John Amos left the show.  He left the show after two seasons.  Only two seasons?  Only two seasons he left the goddamn show because of this bad, black stereotypes that  were being portrayed on this show.  Just horrible.  And nothing funny.  At all.  The lines were so bad and so predictable.  Cornball.  I like John Amos, though.  He's my favorite part of the show.  John Amos.  Yeah, there was some scenes where he was funny, how he'd get pissed off at JJ. 
[00:28:30]  But it just became a big catchphrase.  Like back then with TV, that was the point where it started.  You needed the happy days catchphrase.  You needed the standout person that would come on and you'd hear the woo from the audience.  And then they got, like every episode turned into a special episode.  And this didn't take long in that show.  After a year, they weren't handling comedy anymore.  They were trying to cover the issues that were being presented to the black families of 
[00:29:00]  the time.  And it was just done in a horrible, awful, stereotypical way.  Really bad.  I think all shows need that guy that just walks on and gets the applause and does a  few lines and then walks off.  Oh, like perhaps a neighbor that drops in?  Maybe.  Maybe a friend.  Yeah, we have David Duke checking in.  David, what's up?  Hey, good morning, boys.  Morning.  Just wanted to remind Anthony that our next meeting is tonight and that he should bring  plenty of rope for the after-meeting activity.  Oh, Jesus.  Why?  White people can't use the word? 
[00:29:30]  Take care, boys.  That was the...  If there was any time a white person should use a word, it was when I just used it.  So shut up.  I can think of 655 more appropriate occasions.  But that's just off the top of my head.  Because it was.  That's what they were acting like on this show.  It wasn't...  And it was really the first show that presented a black family as the lead characters in this  show.  It wasn't like All in the Family with the Jeffersons living next door.  And that was later on anyway.  This was a show based on that.  And what they portrayed was this bad, stereotypical black family. 
[00:30:00]  They lived in the ghetto, but...  And then I'm like...  They had this one episode where this building committee was checking all their apartments  and they were going to give a prize for the best apartment, the way it's decorated and  stuff.  And Florida was putting new slipcovers on the couch and everything.  Yet the refrigerator was still filthy.  Like they had...  Around every painting that was on the wall was like the dirt spots. 
[00:30:30]  Like they painted the set like that, obviously, to make it look like the walls.  The front door around the doorknob was just filthy.  If they were going to clean up the place so that a committee could come in and judge how  well you're taking care of it, wouldn't you take a little Formula 405 to it or something?  Maybe just clean it up a bit?  All these slipcovers.  Just the slipcovers on there.  Another one.  This episode killed me.  And now I'm laughing hysterically at the show. 
[00:31:00]  Not with the show.  At the show.  James!  James!  He got a letter that said he was up for this union job that was going to pay $4.50 an  hour!  And they are talking like they're going to move.  They're going to move to a mansion.  This is great.  They're going to get a maid for James making $4.50 an hour.  I understand the show.  Oh, it's Formula 409?  Thank you, Derek.  I made that mistake some other time and someone pointed that out. 
[00:31:30]  409.  You want to wash out stains with a freeway in Los Angeles?  Give me the 10.  I spilled something.  I understood what he was saying.  That's very funny.  Very good.  So James is up for the union job.  Going to make $4.10 an hour or $4.50 an hour.  They're going to move on up.  And he goes, well, Florida, I'm going for the interview tomorrow.  Let's have us a party.  And Florida goes, well, James, where do we get the money?  And he goes, just use the rent money. 
[00:32:00]  We'll have plenty after I get this job.  And I just sat there and I went, oh, no.  I said it.  I said, that's called nigger rich.  That's called, I remember my mother or uncle or something, if you get like 10 bucks in your  pocket and run out and spend it, that's what they called it, being nigger rich.  That was the word for it.  Welcome to the Opian Fat Nick Show.  No shit, man.  No, these are.  Look, if anyone's offended by this, turn the fucking station. 
[00:32:30]  This is just the way people talked, especially back then.  And it's the way I'm describing the situation.  This was language that was used.  And excuse me, sorry, it's still being used.  There are white people.  I hang around people that use it all the time.  That was a term that meant you were spending your money instead of saving it.  And the way it was portrayed on good times, that's what they were doing.  You ever pass a joint around to your friends and it comes back to you and it's all wet? 
[00:33:00]  What is that called?  You lipped it.  Yeah.  You know what else they call it when you spend all your money and don't pay the rent?  Irresponsible.  Right.  Don't hang me out to dry here, kids.  No, absolutely.  Speaking of hanging out, no.  I am totally being honest with the language.  This is terminology like no one's ever heard this before.  Has anyone ever heard this before?  You ever heard that term?  No, absolutely.  Of course you have.  Never. 
[00:33:30]  Never scream it out a window?  No, but I've thought of it a couple times.  Damn fumble.  That was never said in my liberal household.  That was, my mother would throw that term around like it was, like it was, was.  And, yeah, but that was, and of course now James goes for the job interview.  There was some kind of computer glitch.  And James is supposed to be 41, I guess, in the show at the time. 
[00:34:00]  The age cutoff was 35 for this union job.  And because of a computer glitch, it had him, his age being at 35, and he couldn't get the job.  So he's sitting there and gets all pissed off at the white guy behind the desk, goes back home.  They're throwing a big party for him with the rent money.  And he's got to tell everyone he doesn't have the job.  That is what the show is about.  Every episode, there was just this stereotype going on. 
[00:34:30]  A far cry from the Cosby show.  Do we have to play this?  Where that awful word would never come up if you're talking about the Cosby show.  Except maybe sexual harassment.  That awful word.  What is that?  A lot of people requesting a very, very famous Opie and Anthony bit.  I remember that one.  I haven't heard this in years.  I made a little slip up on the show about good times. 
[00:35:00]  You certainly did.  Want to play this thing?  Yeah.  All right, let's go to the tape.  You know, I stole the Playboy with Florida in it.  No, wait.  Florida?  Oh, Delma, Delma, Delma.  James!  James!  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  James, Opie's looking at me, James.  Look, I got that big pack of hot dogs stable to the back of my neck.  James!  Where's JJ?  Delma.  Delma was in Florida.  You said Florida. 
[00:35:30]  Everyone heard it.  Opie had the hots for Florida when he was a kid.  Come on, everyone heard it.  Opie!  Come here, give me some love.  Little brown sugar, Opie.  James!  That was only until Wheezy came along.  All right, all right.  The beauty that was Wheezy.  All right.  Oh, if only I could be George Jefferson.  I'll move you on up.  Now you've gone too far, man.  You said it, man. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  How about that Anesta, Opie?  Shut up.  Come here, heathen.  Oh, man.  Well, let's change the subject and talk about Stephen Lynch.  I could never squeeze out syrup out of that Aunt Jemima bottle without thinking, wow, what a hot babe.  Yeah.  I'd lose my syrup.  Oh, man.  Well, you heard it here, folks.  Opie, hots for Florida from good times. 
[00:36:30]  Stole the Playboy.  That Playboy I never saw, but I guess it's in Opie's personal collection.  The one with Florida.  James, I'm naked and playboy.  All right.  Son of a...  Look at the picture we got on the wall.  Check this out.  James!  Oh, man.  There she is.  Esther Rowe. 
[00:37:00]  Wow.  She is truly dino man.  Yeah, look at that.  Yeah.  That's chocolate thunder.  It just sucks when you put your foot in your mouth on this show, you know?  What was Hugh Hefner thinking that month, huh?  I don't know.  He was on the crank.  All right.  It was after the stroke.  Get me, Esther Rowe!  I am trying to change the subject here so bad, because this could go on for another three weeks. 
[00:37:30]  James!  Just a picture, Opie.  Are you feeling that tingle?  Yeah.  Here it is, Opie.  Time to feel free.  In the time of the month.  Not getting hassled.  Not getting hustled.  Keeping your head up of water.  Opie loves mama.  Dino man!  Good times!  I'd rather lay off. 
[00:38:00]  Good times!  Easy credit rip-off.  Good times!  Racking and surviving.  Every time.  Hanging and a jaw in!  Good times!  Hey, we're lucky we got him.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  Good times!  Yeah!  Opie's got good times in his pants.  Woo!  James!  Now, J.J., I have company this evening. 
[00:38:30]  Opie's coming over.  After James got killed, remember that?  Yeah.  She would have liked a guy like you.  Shut up.  You'd have, uh, fit good in the projects.  All right.  You'd have to suffer the scrutiny of, uh, of Michael, the younger brother.  Yes!  Yes!  Remember how angry he was.  That's right.  I don't think Opie would have cut the mustard with...  Michael!  His hair and everything.  Mama!  Why are you dating that white boy? 
[00:39:00]  He's very nice.  Now, come on.  Let mama go out with Opie.  James!  Mama, he's the devil.  Well, he sure is the devil in bed.  Wait till I tell Walona what he did to me.  Of course he can't stack up to James where it counts. 
[00:39:30]  You know, this picking on someone is not that fun after all.  I always thought it was fun to pick on people.  Oh, it's a blast.  Come on this side.  All right.  This song about the truth.  I wrote it about a lady I was seeing not too long ago.  Hopefully I'll remember the lyrics.  Have a seat and listen. 
[00:40:00]  Please don't say a thing.  In matters of the heart sometimes the truth will have a sting.  Just don't take it personally.  This is no attack.  But we will never last because I'm white and you are also white.  I only like black girls, the brown girls, the cafe au lait, the caramel girls and mocha girls.  Just blow me away.  If you are newbie and I want you to be in every fantasy. 
[00:40:30]  But if you're a whitey, say nighty-nighty, you're just not the girl for me.  Well, her body is a turn-on, curvaceous front and back.  Her hair is quite literally an aphrodisiac.  Don't call it jungle fever because that just isn't right.  I am not a racist.  Some of my best friends are white.  I just prefer black girls, the brown girls, the cafe au lait, the caramel girls and mocha girls. 
[00:41:00]  Just blow me away.  Well, if you're a cracker, you better get blacker or else you best get out.  It is no mystery.  I like a sister.  See, that's what I'm talking about.  Ooh.  Oh, man, I hate vanilla ice cream.  White rice is so bland.  The milk chocolate melts in your mouth, not in your hand. 
[00:41:30]  But color is not the issue here.  It's dignity.  It's class.  It's all about her heart.  Okay, it's partly about that ass.  I want me some black girls, the brown girls, the cafe au lait, the caramel girls and mocha girls.  Just blow me away.  Well, if you're a honky, you're singing the wrong key.  It's the honest truth.  The skin that she's dwelling in must contain melanin.  And that is the fountain of youth.  And that is the fountain of youth.  Thomas Jefferson. 
[00:42:00]  Robert De Niro.  Well, strong thermal.  Strong thermal.  Yeah.  Nice.  Yes.  Thank you.  It's crazy.  Short thermal.  This is what it's all about. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, I love this.  Short thermal.  Wow.  T-Shot 36 double D.  T-Shot 36 double D.  Shoving her breasts in everyone's face.  36 double D.  T-Shot 36 double D.  Oh, wow.  She just whoops herself.  She just whooped her down. She just whooped her down. Anywhere.  With the Mound Wednesday.  She'll flash. She'll flash. 
[00:43:00]  Hey, I'm all for it.  She'll flash.  And there's boobs in your face. I'm all for it.  With the Mound Wednesday.  The night that's resting.  Hey, this is what it's all about.  With the Mound Wednesday.  Oh, I loved it.  With the Mound Wednesday.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, wow. 
[00:43:30]  With them fuckers out.  This is fantastic.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  That's why we call it wow.  Talk about the boobies.  Take your fall and take it out now. 
[00:44:00]  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  It's a fine Whip-A-Mount Wednesday here in New York City. 
[00:44:30]  Wow is alive and well.  For the new listeners, what are you waiting for?  Just an extra bonus if you're a fan of the show.  Basically, Wow is Whip-A-Mount Wednesday. 
[00:45:00]  But at this point, if a lady sees a Wow on a truck or a car, she'll flash you anytime.  She won't just wait for Wednesday.  No.  We just like to celebrate it on Wednesday.  So you can get your official Wow bumper stickers by just sending a self-addressed stamped envelope to us here in New York City.  And we'll send the Wow stickers out immediately.  That address is up on opianthony.com.  But if you have a pencil handy, grab a pencil.  Or if you don't, just try to figure out when we're going to do this part of the show in the replay and then have a pencil handy. 
[00:45:30]  Very, very good.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show, XM Satellite Radio, of course.  111 West 57th Street, New York, New York, 10019.  Self-addressed stamped envelope and we'll send the Wow stickers out to you.  And what does that mean, Anthony?  You throw the Wow on your car?  Yeah.  Just throw it on your car and you drive around and a girl sees it and decides she's going to show you her titties.  That's right.  That's how it works.  I've seen a lot more Wow XM stickers. 
[00:46:00]  Of course, you drive around, I see the Wow, the old radio station stickers that we used to give out.  But now I'm starting to look and see, oh, that's an XM one over there.  Oh, another XM one on that van.  Yeah, so people are really catching on.  You've got to put this on your vehicle.  That's why we like to say, you know, the ONA virus.  Spread the virus.  Slowly but surely, it's spreading.  Spreading here, spreading there.  Daniel from Alabama.  From Bama.  Alabama, man.  Alabama, man.  We need that clip. 
[00:46:30]  That was hysterical.  Yeah, we play it every once in a while.  Maybe someone in there should be listening to 202 because you just played the same Stephen Lynch song just before you guys came on live today.  Oh, really?  Sex Bagel Sucks Ass.  No, I suggested that, actually.  I suggested that.  I thought it would make sense after that whole Good Times thing.  Oh, that blows.  And we have 100 Stephen Lynch songs to play.  Whoopsie.  Sorry, that'll happen from time to time.  All right, Space Shuttle.  Is this thing going to be all right when it comes back to Earth?  Who knows? 
[00:47:00]  There's, well, the cover of the New York Post shows the shuttle and a big headline, trouble.  Trouble.  Look out.  I guess it hit a bird.  And then shuttle jitters, debris events at blastoff.  They have it in quotation marks.  I guess that's what they're calling it, a debris event.  And, yeah, there were a couple of things that happened.  A piece of the orbiter's tile came off during separation. 
[00:47:30]  A piece of something, some debris, came off of the main fuel tank.  And a couple of seconds after launch, a bird slammed into the nose cone.  What are the odds?  What are the odds?  Stupid bird.  How do you not see that in the sky?  Right?  Fucking birds.  Birds are scared of everything.  But it's going so fast.  It's not like you can sneak up on a bird.  You walk and it's like, flutters away.  All frightened.  Some out of the flaming rocket crept up on you. 
[00:48:00]  Big flaming multicolored thing just whizzing at you.  And, well, I like the way NASA's handling this.  They're kind of in a let's not panic state of mind here.  And they're going to look at things today or tomorrow.  I think they're putting the old robot arm out.  They've got this new little laser thing on the arm.  And the arm can now reach around to the underside of the orbiter.  Check for everything.  Yes, Jimmy? 
[00:48:30]  Of course, I'm thinking, you're the type of shuttle that would lose a tile  without even having the goddamn common courtesy to give a reach around.  And that's exactly what the arm does.  Kind of gives a reach around to the front of the shuttle.  And it's going to check all the tiles.  But they have it on film.  This was one of the most filmed or videotaped launches ever.  They had camera angles from everywhere.  Chase planes on the ship itself.  The launch pad.  Lots of cameras.  And what they saw was pieces of tile falling off of the shuttle. 
[00:49:00]  I got it there on the cover of the news.  You can see the little white spots.  And it's on the underside, kind of by the front landing gear door,  which could be a little touchy.  That's kind of a touchy area.  High heat area, they call that right there.  And then what came off of the fuel tank didn't hit the shuttle.  But you see it kind of tumbling away.  And it didn't hit it this time.  You know, they've got to solve these problems.  I like how they call it debris.  Isn't debris garbage? 
[00:49:30]  This is stuff that they put on the shuttle on purpose.  When they were building it, it had a name.  It has a purpose.  If it's just something that didn't belong there,  why would they put it there in the first place?  But they call it debris like it's garbage.  If you're driving in your car and something flies out the window,  like you empty your ashtray or a McDonald's cup, that's debris.  If your door flies off, that's your door. 
[00:50:00]  That is something that you need.  You would notice it's gone.  It could present a problem later on.  It's not like you're throwing something out.  Something maybe falls off a little, I don't know, some garbage from inside.  They call it debris like it's, well, we put it there so it can fall off.  So this could be, there could be a problem here.  Well, we got some audio from NASA.  Want to go to that first clip?  Talks about the camera underneath the shuttle. 
[00:50:30]  That was a great shot, by the way.  Wasn't it?  You know, they should have had that from the start.  We've never seen the underside of the orbiter like that, especially at separation.  Um, that video, frankly, exceeded our expectations.  We did not expect to have such clarity.  Yeah, that's pretty damn cool.  Yeah, I think it was way the hell up there when it separated and they finally lost the signal.  Now work on our camera phones.  Yeah, how come our camera phones suck?  Video phone, indeed. 
[00:51:00]  It is not.  Not yet, anyway.  That choppy crap.  Stop trying to sell me a phone that takes, sell me a phone that takes video.  It's not working.  The worst is when they try to take pictures of you.  All right, dude, uh, wait, did it save?  Uh, uh.  Oh, I know.  All right, let me get a picture of my phone.  They're holding the phone up.  They can't see anything.  Yeah, wait, what did he do?  What did he hit you?  Let me, let me look at it.  And they got to go through 800 buttons before they could even look at what they just took.  The grainy mess.  Video, phone cameras, I want to smash them in your faces when you use them. 
[00:51:30]  They're terrible.  It's a waste of time.  Have you seen what is coming out now, being sold in some drugstores?  You know, they have the disposable cameras.  They have those little cardboard Kodak cameras.  And then they came up with the disposable digital camera.  It's a little odd.  You use it, and then you take it back to a CVS or whatever drugstore, and they put it on a disc for you.  Yeah.  And you take it home.  Now they have digital video cameras.  They're disposable video cameras.  For, I think it was $39, $40, you take this thing. 
[00:52:00]  You can get 20 minutes of video on it, and it's like half the resolution of a normal camcorder.  And very thin.  You can fit it in your pocket.  You take the video, take it back to them, or you can upload it right to your computer,  and they'll give you a disc if you take it back to the store.  You return it to them.  I guess you get some kind of deposit back.  And you have video, 20 minutes of video.  So that's another one of these little disposable things.  So you don't need your video camera to cart it around with you the whole time. 
[00:52:30]  $40, that's a lot.  That is a lot of money for something, for 20 minutes of video.  Bad quality.  Bad quality video.  But like anything else, I guess it's going to get cheaper.  Yeah, I was going to say, within a year, it'll be knocked in half probably.  Yeah.  And then, like, people have cameras for everything, you know, with their camera phones.  And perhaps we'll get more horrible, horrific people dying videos on the news from people having these little video cameras.  All right.  Let's go to the next clip from NASA, talking about the thermal tile that flew off the bottom of the ship. 
[00:53:00]  A little white spot is where a piece of tile may have sheared, and part of it came off.  I was reading in the paper today, this is, what, the 114th shuttle mission, and they still have tiles falling off?  Tiles falling off.  Where is the force field?  It's 2005.  I want our force field.  How about one big tile that wraps around it so it can't fall off?  One giant tile.  Shrink-wrapped the whole damn thing. 
[00:53:30]  Packaging is a nightmare these days.  They can't package the space shuttle a little better?  I guess it would just be so goddamn expensive.  I guess.  How would you make something like that?  I think it's in our interest to try it, though.  I mean, it's a space shuttle.  There's so many intricate little nooks and crannies on this thing where every tile is different on this.  Every one is numbered and lettered, and it goes in the same spot.  There's no real interchangeable one.  That was the problem about having spare tiles.  What they have up there now is the means to make a tile in the shape that they need. 
[00:54:00]  They have little tile saws and their Elmer's glue or whatever they're using up there to stick these things on.  But whenever there's a problem, they can now make their own tiles.  All right.  Let's go to the next clip here.  It just looks like something peels off and goes away.  Now, it does not hit the orbiter.  It looks like it clears the whole stack with no problems.  But, of course, we're very interested in understanding what this is.  Okay, that was the unknown piece of debris that just flies by the camera.  Yeah. 
[00:54:30]  They're like, uh-oh.  Pretty odd.  What else did we lose on this thing?  Now, they're saying it's okay.  It didn't hit the orbiter.  But it didn't hit the orbiter on plenty of missions.  It hit on one.  Something hit.  You know, it just takes that one time.  If shit's flying off of this thing and missing the orbiter, eventually something's going to get hit.  And at that speed, even something really small can screw this thing up.  So, you know what the problem is?  They go too fast.  Everything's moving too fast.  They should just go up slowly.  Go up very slowly, Jimmy?  Take it at an easier pace. 
[00:55:00]  Maybe 55 miles an hour.  That's good.  Saves lives.  Speed limit.  All right.  Let's do the, uh...  It would be amazing.  Imagine how long that would take and how much fuel you need to slowly lift something up like that.  Let's go to the next clip.  This clip just drove me nuts.  They have to do this cutesy shit every time there's a space shuttle going up.  Hit it.  Good morning, Discovery.  And welcome to tomorrow.  The wake-up music this morning was for the entire crew. 
[00:55:30]  And in case you couldn't make it out, it was excerpts from the movie Groundhog Day.  We were sort of celebrating the fact that you finally broke out of your quarantine cycle.  That's what you want to hear when you're in the shuttle after the last one crashed.  Groundhog Day music.  Yeah.  Right.  Which means it's just going to happen again.  Over and over and over.  That's very encouraging.  I thought it was the clip of Sonny and Cher.  That clip made me puke, too.  But, uh...  Let's play the next one. 
[00:56:00]  It's always such bad quality, the music that they play.  It's very tinny.  Awful.  Yeah, there it is.  That's all you got?  Hawk.  Uh-oh.  That's good.  Hawk.  Uh-oh.  Where is it?  Would you record that in a car driving by a TV at 55?  All right.  Record.  Yeah.  Got it.  All right.  Go to six.  Go to six, then.  Let's play six.  They're good.  They're all good.  Do you know what today is? 
[00:56:30]  Today is tomorrow.  What was that?  A clip from Groundhog's Day.  Oh, why?  Great movie, but they're playing clips with the gang up there?  They play, like, awful stuff all the time.  Wake up, astronauts.  Come on, baby.  Let's do the twist.  What fucking year?  It's 2005.  Can we hear something? 
[00:57:00]  And everyone at Mission Control is like,  we're playing rock and roll for them.  What the fuck?  Trying to show their hip side.  Yeah.  Hey, we beat Sputnik.  What?  Catch.  Awful.  You're trying to show their hip side.  Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, peggie suit.  Oh, peggie.  What?  2000.  Check my calendar.  All right.  Enough of that.  So we'll see what happens with the space shuttle.  Yes.  We will get updates, I'm sure.  Of course.  Make sure they're okay. 
[00:57:30]  A-okay to come down.  I'm burning for you by blue oyster.  It'll be a nice one to wake them up, too.  Oh, that's awful.  Burning down the house.  Talking heads.  That's horrid.  Mark Zupan.  What's up?  Big fan, big fan.  Mark, how are you?  I'm doing well.  I can't say enough about Murderball.  Mark Zupan is the star of Murderball.  Where are you calling from, Mark?  Austin, Texas.  Austin, Texas? 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, I actually got to go home for three days or four days or whatever the hell it is.  Got you touring all over the place?  Yeah, I've been kind of running since, shit, I think two months ago.  Really?  Yeah.  I saw the movie about two or three weeks ago.  I brought it to the program, talked about it for about 20 minutes, and no one really  called, which surprised me.  And then I found out that it was only in limited release, and now they're going to release the  movie all over the place, huh?  Right.  I think it's this weekend it's going to get wide release. 
[00:58:30]  It was released last Friday on, I think, top 40 markets are kind of more of a limited  but a wider than it was before.  Right.  It's starting to get recognized a lot?  Yeah, it's kind of weird.  I mean, there was a, the weekly paper, the Austin Chronicle, they did a cover story,  so I went out Saturday, and shit, couldn't go into a bar, like, oh, let me buy a shot,  let me buy a shot, let me buy a beer.  Yeah, the free drinks rule, don't they?  God, you're not kidding.  It was quite nice. 
[00:59:00]  Well, you want to explain the movie to the newbies out there?  Sure.  The movie's pretty much kind of like jackass meets the NFL meets some psycho from a psycho ward.  It's full contact wheelchair rugby, so you can hit somebody as hard as you possibly want  to or can, and you get commended for it.  You don't get punished or yelled at or what have you.  Yeah, these guys all have some form of a, you know, disability, and they're just going 
[00:59:30]  hardcore into each other.  It's a real sport.  I thought, no offense, you know, because I didn't know anything about this crap.  I thought it was going to be a cute little thing, but you guys are true athletes.  You work your asses off.  It's, the competition is amazing, and yeah, you take it seriously, and you're beating  the crap out of each other trying to win the games, right?  Right.  I mean, we're pretty much, I work a 50-hour-a-week job, and I train.  I'm in the gym lifting 10 to 12 hours at least, and then in my rugby chair, 10 to 12, just pushing 
[01:00:00]  and to get in endurance shape, and then to play, we play maybe 12 more hours on the  weekend, so.  It doesn't leave much time for anything else.  No, I mean, girlfriend's not.  Did you ever walk or no?  What's up?  Were you always in a wheelchair or no?  I didn't hear.  Were you always in a wheelchair or no?  Oh, no, I'm sorry.  I got hurt when I was 18.  This story is crazy.  You want to tell it, Mark?  Yeah, I can tell it.  That's cool. 
[01:00:30]  We were.  We got paralyzed.  Yeah.  Sorry to say it like that, but.  Yeah.  I was out.  We just, I played college soccer.  We were out after winning a game.  I was drunk.  My buddy was drunk.  I wandered out of the bar, passed out in the back of his pickup.  He didn't know I was back there.  He wandered out about an hour later, and he hopped in the car and drove.  He got lost, and he got lost going down south in South Florida, spun out, threw me out of 
[01:01:00]  the back of the pickup truck, over a fence, over some trees, into a canal where I spent  14 hours hanging onto a branch until somebody found me.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Dude, he just wandered out of the bar and hammered.  What the fucking odds have that happened?  And decided to just kind of pass out on the back of the pickup truck, and his friend had  no idea he was back there.  Did your friend, is your friend all right, or did he die, or did he live?  He was fine.  Nothing happened.  Absolutely nothing happened to the guy. 
[01:01:30]  He just got arrested.  Was he hammered?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Completely hammered.  God damn.  But now you guys are friends again, right, because you went through a period where you  weren't friends?  Yeah.  It was...  Because you guys were like best friends, right, or pretty close?  He was my college roommate.  He was...  You know, we went to high school together, and you'd have your years.  I mean, we'd talk for a year.  We wouldn't talk for a year.  We would talk for two.  We wouldn't talk for two.  But what was cool about the movie is it just brought us back together. 
[01:02:00]  We were sitting in Athens after the final game, and I looked at him, and I said, I go,  do you ever think that we'd be here?  He kind of looks at me and goes, not really.  I knew we were going to be somewhere, but not necessarily here.  I'm like, do you ever think this is the best thing that's ever happened to me?  He kind of looked at me and goes, huh?  Huh.  I go, do you ever think this is the best thing that's ever happened to me?  He goes, huh.  That's interesting.  I mean, I coined him.  I call him the Quadfather. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, shit.  So we set up a website, quadfather.net.  It's kind of funny.  He's just...  He's like, don't call me the Quadfather.  I'm like, why, dude?  You've got to be pretty comfortable with it.  You did make me.  And he's like, oh, that's wrong.  But I like it.  He's really...  There must have been some severe guilt on his part for quite a while.  Yeah, I mean, I think it was hard.  I forgave him the instant he came into the...  I was still in ICU.  He came in and he had like...  He looked like a dog with his tail between his legs. 
[01:03:00]  I'm like, what the fuck's the problem?  Everything's fine.  And I think that lightened it up on him a little.  But I mean, he mentally had to go through...  Mentally and emotionally had to go through a hell of a time.  Well, it must not have been that easy for you either.  No, but I think it was easier.  Really?  Like, that was how long ago?  Ten years, maybe?  It was twelve years.  Twelve years?  So I'm sure early on you probably had quite a time with it. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, of course.  I mean, the first two years were difficult.  I'm not going to say they weren't.  Yeah.  You know, you have to figure out what the hell's going on with your life.  If you're eighteen years old, your independence is...  You had just gotten your independence away from your parents and, you know, you were having  fun at school.  And then you're thrown right back into your parents' house.  You're like, oh, okay.  But you're in a body that you're not familiar with.  You've got to learn how to shit, to piss, to eat, to dress, to just live.  Damn.  And once you figure it out, once you figure out that, you know, walking isn't the most 
[01:04:00]  important thing in life and you can find something else to do, and that's where I found  rugby, it opens the world.  I mean, it just opens so many more opportunities.  It offers a lot.  Yeah, how did you find it?  It was just time.  I mean, I found rugby initially about a month after I got hurt, but I was so focused on,  oh, yeah, you know, wheelchair sports is cool, but I'm not going to need it because I'll be  out of the chair in no time. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, you had that going on?  Oh, yeah.  You know, a guy came over to my parents' house and they threw, they put down a ramp and he  was going to concrete bolt it to the step.  And I'm like, no, dude, you don't have to worry about that.  I'll be out of this thing in like six months.  You should explain that because when you're injured like that, there's so much swelling  and there are guys that do come out of it eventually.  Right.  And then others, you know, after the six, well, I hear up to like two years or something  like that, and two years later, you're still hoping, well, the swelling's going to go down 
[01:05:00]  a little more.  I'm going to get a lot more movement back, and unfortunately, it never happens for a lot  of people.  Right.  I guess the thing is, as long as you don't sever your spinal cord, you sever your spinal  cord, then it's hard to get, it's hard if the impulses even get down to your lower  limbs.  Yeah.  It's just, it's an incomplete and complete injury.  Complete means you severed your spinal cord.  Incomplete is kind of, it means you may have done damage to the spinal cord, but you didn't 
[01:05:30]  completely disconnect the impulses from the brain to the lower body.  Right.  So, it's kind of like a freight electrical cord.  What do you have?  I am a C6, C7 incomplete.  So, it's like a freight electrical cord.  Some impulses get down there, some impulses don't.  So, is there a possibility that, you know, if they do stem cell or whatever, that you could  walk in, or is that completely out of the question?  I don't know.  I haven't really thought about it, because it doesn't, if I could, I don't know if I 
[01:06:00]  necessarily would.  I don't think I would.  Wow.  Just because.  That's interesting.  I've done and met so many people, and the chair, I mean, the chair, to me, is normal.  Mm-hmm.  You know, it doesn't bother me.  I can pick up, I can, well, you look at it this way, I have a great ass level view of  the world.  Do you find, like, and I mean, like, I mean, to be in your situation, especially after having,  like, you know, been mobile for 18 years, do you ever look at, like, all right, well, 
[01:06:30]  this, you know, it sucks on one level, but on another level, thank God it wasn't, like,  you know, what happened to Christopher Reeve, where, like, you have no mobility below the  neck at all.  Well, it's, I mean, yeah, I'm very, very fortunate to be where I am, but I don't look back and  say, oh, I wish I was still walking, or I wish this, or I wish that.  I am very fortunate, and I am fortunate to have the mobility that I have.  I, you know, yeah, Christopher Reeve, to be in his situation would be a hell of a lot 
[01:07:00]  more difficult.  Mm-hmm.  You know, I didn't really sit down and think about it.  I am glad that I, I have the level, and I am where I am, but I didn't really, you know,  I never really sat down and thought about that.  Yeah, so how did you get into the, uh, the rugby?  Well, obviously you were an athlete growing up, and, uh, you know, when it was time to  move on, you decided to, you wanted to be competitive again, right?  Yeah.  I, I, I transferred to Georgia Tech from Florida, I was playing soccer at Florida Atlantic 
[01:07:30]  University, and I transferred to Georgia Tech about a year after I was hurt.  And I was going to rehab up in Atlanta, and a lady who was my physical therapist was like,  yeah, you know what, there's, there's a game I think you might like.  It's called rugby.  I'm like, oh yeah, I've heard of rugby.  So, she brought me down, her husband, her boyfriend at the time, who's now her husband, played.  So, I hopped in, started playing, and the rest is history. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, and they, uh, you know, you fix up your wheelchairs and everything, it's almost like,  uh, I don't know, you look like gladiators out there in a way.  Yeah, I mean, that's kind of, that's essentially what it's like.  It's kind of like something from a Mad Max, a Mad Max film.  Yeah, you gotta see these wheelchairs.  I mean, they're, ah, it's all metal, and it's just crazy.  It's like a projectile, to, to an extent.  You, you strap onto your ass projectile, and you.  And you use it just to wail into it.  Just wail, and wail, and they show it in the movie, where these guys are falling out of their chairs, 
[01:08:30]  on their heads, I mean, it's, it's nuts.  You know, I got a, I got a friend, um, we met him through the radio show, it's Eddie from Big Brother.  He won the first season of Big Brother, he has one leg.  And, uh, he kept in inviting me down to watch him play, uh, wheelchair basketball.  And, uh, you know, I, I was clueless, I had no idea.  You know, I thought, whatever.  And I went down, I could not believe how competitive it was, and how insane you guys are in the chairs.  You know, he was playing wheelchair basketball, where these guys were flipping, and just, just 
[01:09:00]  crashing into the walls, each other, falling down, getting run over.  It was nuts.  And your first instinct, watching it, is like, oh no, someone help him.  Right, oh yeah.  You know?  Right.  Do you find that, a lot of people have that image, like, you know, you, you, you're fragile  almost, and have to be, uh, helped?  Definitely.  You know, it's, I mean, people always feel like, oh wait, I can't go talk to him.  Oh, he, he might need some help.  Let me go help him.  Mm-hmm.  The worst is, if you're pushing up a hill, and somebody gets behind you and starts pushing,  you fucking, you turn sideways, you're like, did I ask you to push me? 
[01:09:30]  Right.  Don't touch me.  That's annoying.  Turn around and push you back down the hill.  You got a smart answer.  What I love about the movie is that you guys obviously show that, uh, you're living normal  lives, that, uh, you have a sense of humor.  You know, these guys are pulling gags on each other and, and others, you know, throughout  the whole movie.  Uh, one of his teammates, uh, has, what, no, no arms, uh.  No arms, no legs.  No arms, no legs, basically.  Just kind of stubs.  He's a quadruple amputee, yeah.  Yeah, stubs for arms. 
[01:10:00]  Right.  And they, uh, they're in a hotel, you know, and, uh, and they, they put them in a box and  then invite, like, uh.  Who'd you invite in?  That was one of our, that was a physical therapist.  Yeah, yeah, so, you know, it's a box that obviously would not fit a, quote, normal human  being or whatever, and he's in there because he's so short because he has no limbs, and  all of a sudden kind of jumps out of the box and freaks out the lady, and I'm like, these  guys rock.  And most of you had girlfriends, right?  Yeah.  And, uh, and, and you explain in the movie that you're, you're all having sex like crazy. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, I mean, everything works fine.  It's, it's a fun, fun time.  Thank God for that.  Was that, like, a big concern at first?  Like, you know, like, shit.  Well, I mean, you're coming out of the hospital and you're sitting in the hospital and you're  like, well, wait, let's see what works.  And you're just laying in bed.  You're like, oh, okay, this is still good.  I mean, you've got to, you've got to figure out, you've got to figure out if the equipment  still works.  Yeah.  Of course.  Yeah.  So, yeah, they, they show these guys a tape on how they could still have sex. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  How, how funny was, how funny was that sex, that sex, that vid?  I said, I said on the air after I saw the movie that that was really hilarious and we  have to get that film.  It was pretty disturbing.  I was hoping you could, they were going to show more of that video during the film.  Actually, you know what might be interesting on the DVD extras?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I've heard that.  I didn't, I've never seen the full flick, but I heard it's pretty bad.  It's like a seventies porn. 
[01:11:30]  Wow.  That's great.  I mean, it's that, it's that graphic.  Oh, so you haven't seen the film.  I've only, I've only seen.  The excerpts or whatever?  Yeah.  The excerpts of that.  They show this, this, this, this woman completely naked grabbing her, you know, her boyfriend that's,  you know, is paralyzed in some way and just giving him like kind of a hug and then falling  backwards onto the bed.  On the bed?  Yeah.  And start going at it.  And then they cut the, you know, they cut the footage.  I thought it'd be pretty interesting to see what happens from there.  Yeah.  What?  I think it could have been NC-17 if they would have put the whole video in. 
[01:12:00]  Oh.  Yeah.  We've got to get our hands on that.  I can try to get it for you guys, though.  Definitely.  But it was, I loved the movie.  I really did.  I'm going to go see it again, matter of fact, Mark.  Well, that's cool.  I appreciate it.  And who knew that this, the Paralympic Games, you know, who knew after the regular Olympics,  whatever you want to call it, they had the summer Paralympic Games using the same facilities  in Athens.  Right.  And they just showed a montage of all the sports and these people just like taking it 
[01:12:30]  way, way serious.  Yeah.  It was really cool to see, you know.  People running with one leg, with the metal leg and stuff.  Right.  And just going balls out, man.  Well, the Paralympics is the second biggest sporting event in the world.  Yeah.  Behind the Olympics.  I mean, we just don't get the, the Paralympics doesn't get the notoriety, it doesn't get the  exposure that the Olympics does.  Yeah.  They don't get the funding.  I mean, there's a lot of differences, but yet.  And you guys get really pissed off when they try to compare you to the Special Olympics. 
[01:13:00]  Are you shitting me?  Well, the Special Olympics, that's, you know, where everyone's getting an award for just  being there.  These guys, it is the real deal.  They're competing for the medals and, you know, even if they get the silver, then no,  they really want the gold and they're disappointed, just like the regular Olympics, you know.  I mean, we're one of, if you look at it this way, I was one of 12 people out of 500  that made it, that made the U.S. team.  So, it's not like, oh yeah, well, do you want to play? 
[01:13:30]  Well, why don't you just come join?  Yeah, right.  You don't just join.  You got to try out.  You got to bust your ass.  Mm-hmm.  It's rigorous.  And the coach that is featured in Murderball, he was coaching the Canadian team.  What a psycho.  Really?  That's all I'll say for the people that are going to go see the film.  Is he in a wheelchair or is he walking?  He's in a wheelchair.  He's in a wheelchair.  He's been, it looks like he's been in a wheelchair his whole life, but he is a psycho, man.  Yeah, he's a piece of, he's a piece of work.  So, so what irritates, Mark, what irritates you most is when people are kind of like paternalistic 
[01:14:00]  and just trying to, you know, like kind of talk to you like you're not a complete person  or that you'd constantly need their assistance of some sort.  Right.  Well, what's also, what also happens if you're, say you're with somebody else, they'll talk  to the other person.  It's like, do you think he wants to eat?  You're kidding, right?  It's like, hey, I'm right here.  You can ask me if I want to eat.  Does he want to eat?  Just anything like that.  And there's a picture of Mark Zupan on the computer.  Holy shit.  Would you mess with him?  No.  On any level? 
[01:14:30]  No.  Of course not.  But they still think he's, you know, helpless because he's in a chair.  Please.  All right.  This guy would kick your ass.  Damn.  Upper body strength.  Holy shit.  You look a little like Hetfield.  Have you ever been told that?  Hetfield?  Yeah, for a question.  I haven't heard Hetfield.  I've heard, I don't even, there's comparisons that Alexi Lalas, there's comparisons to,  but no, I haven't heard Hetfield.  That's actually quite a compliment.  Thanks.  A little bit.  Very, very good. 
[01:15:00]  So.  All right.  Hey, what about the guy in the movie, the motocross guy?  Keith?  Yeah.  Keith, this is kind of cool.  I got a.  That was really, that was really sad.  Just to bring everyone to the, on the same page here, they, part of the movie is they  show this guy, Keith, who was pretty big in the motocross world and he got paralyzed and  they show him, you know, in the hospital, just go, it's just starting his, his new journey.  And man, he, it was, it was very interesting by the end of the film, but go ahead, Mark.  Well, what's good, what, what Keith embodies is he's like the every quad. 
[01:15:30]  He was, he is me, he is Andy, he is Scott when we were young.  I mean, you could, they could have put in the film just us explaining it, but just to  see it, to see the, the trials, the tribulations that he goes through makes it just so much  more.  But what was cool is Keith, we essentially, I went and spoke at his rehab hospital and  we put him in my rugby chair. 
[01:16:00]  I brought it and he just lit up like a kid in a candy store.  Yeah.  I mean, he was so happy.  He's like, wow, I didn't know this was possible.  I didn't know there were other things to do to be competitive that.  So for the premiere in New York, I was talking to a lady, I think probably about three months  before.  She's like, I saw the movie in Boston.  I want to donate some money.  I'm like, all right.  She's like, I want to bike eat the chair.  So got the money, got him a chair and I surprised him at the New York premiere. 
[01:16:30]  Everyone was standing up.  We called all the subjects down.  And he was on the left side of the theater.  Since everyone was standing, I snuck down the right side with his chair.  I called him up and he just, again, was blown away.  He goes, wait, this is mine?  I get to take this home with me?  I'm like, yeah, Keith, this is all yours.  And I think he finally played on Monday. 
[01:17:00]  So we'll see.  What did one of those things go for?  About $3,500.  Wow.  Pretty steep.  So you're sitting there, you're paying $3,500 just to beat the shit out of it.  Yeah, and you guys do.  All right, Mark.  Thank you so much for calling the show today.  Thanks for having me.  It's Murderball.  It's going to be released all over the country, I guess, starting Friday, huh?  Yeah.  I mean, it's in certain theaters now, but it's going to go wider.  I know it's going to open in Atlanta this weekend, Cleveland this weekend, I think D.C. this weekend. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, I really enjoyed the movie.  I mean, you guys, it was inspirational, sir.  Well, I appreciate that.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you, man.  Take a deep, man.  Mark Zupan, the star of Murderball.  And there you have it.  It's funny.  Every guy, when he was talking, every guy, what every man first thinks is, does your dick work?  I mean, it's the first thing every man.  That's what instant feedback was.  You want it.  But I think, I don't know if that's out of line to ask.  Like, really? 
[01:18:00]  He mentioned it.  I don't know, man.  I don't know.  There's certain questions you might ask that are just like, you know, that might be like  the push up the hill of questions, like where it's just an insult and you don't want to  do that.  Yeah, that's why sometimes it's uncomfortable.  You just don't know what's appropriate or not.  You just don't want to be a shithead.  We're all stupid.  Well, the best part is when he brought up the film, saying, wasn't that hilarious?  I'm like, oh, good.  You do have a sense of humor because the video is ridiculous, actually.  I got to see that.  It's ridiculous.  Well, we've been trying to find it.  We're trying to find the video that was featured in Murderball. 
[01:18:30]  So, naked woman just like grabbing the guy and just falling backwards onto the bed to  get him up on the bed.  And then, and that's when they didn't show any more footage.  I want to see what happens next.  You'd think if he was offered a miracle cure to walk that he wouldn't take it.  Of course.  It's almost like, and it's like you're listening to a guy talking.  He's telling the truth.  But it's almost like I think in anything, and again, I'm not speaking from experience,  but you get to a point where you kind of accept, okay, this is the way it is.  For the fact, here it is. 
[01:19:00]  It is what it is.  I'm doing fine here.  But to get my hopes up or to think about the other option is inexcusable.  Yeah, it would probably just prey on you every day.  So, you might as well just say, no, this is my life now.  This is what I'm doing.  If offered this miracle cure that could make me walk, I wouldn't take it, blah, blah, blah.  Stevie Wonder may say, I wouldn't take sight, and it may be believable, because I don't  think he ever saw something.  If you've never had something, maybe you can't picture life without it.  But if you walked into your 18, and then you've been hurt for 11 years, I mean, it's, I don't 
[01:19:30]  know.  I think even Stevie Wonder would want sight.  Maybe.  I'm just saying if you're born a certain life.  Just out of curiosity, you know, you're living in a world where just about everyone sees,  and you'd want to know what it's all about.  Probably.  I don't know.  He's doing fine without it.  He seems to be.  He sure can play the piano.  I'm trying to get a lot of my musical people.  All right.  We'll take a break.  On the way today, we got Bill Burr coming in. 
[01:20:00]  Is he here?  I see him sitting right out there.  Oh, he's where?  I see him sitting right out there on our chairs.  Sam.  In the gallery.  I am Sam.  Bill Burr, he helped Jimmy interview some folks at the OzFest yesterday.  Correction, Billy did a lot of different interviewing.  My interviews, I guarantee, are tedious and boring.  It was just me groveling.  No.  Yeah, it's okay.  It's fine.  It is what it is.  I was happy to do it.  All right.  Well, we got lots of audio from OzFest.  We want to go through that with Jimmy and Bill Burr. 
[01:20:30]  And then at 10 o'clock today, Paul Provenza in studio.  That's very cool.  The director of Aristocrats.  Right.  Aristocrats.  I went to the after party last night.  You did?  Yes.  How was that?  It was okay.  I mean, I came home from...  I'll talk about OzFest after, but I was very, very tired, so I didn't actually stay for  the Sabbath.  I was too tired, man.  I was sunburned and shit.  I'm like, dude, just go home because you have to get up in the morning.  I thought of the show.  Steve was just a wreck.  Walked into the office this morning and Steve was... 
[01:21:00]  We wanted to send him home.  He had to go through all the audio and make it so we could play it on the radio.  His eyes were red.  Yeah, he needs to go home.  I'm being maced.  I'm trying to rope somebody with his fat Lebanese fingers.  Big bare arms wrapped around someone.  Oh, he is a creep.  Spend the day with that sweaty animal.  Child shorts.  Awful low socks.  I'm going to pull up his legs.  All right, we'll get the lowdown.  We'll get the lowdown about OzFest next. 
[01:21:30]  It is a natural impulse to grab and squeeze, squeeze the breasts.  Squeeze the breasts.  No shit.  It's real, real soft.  Almost like pudding.  Almost like pudding.  Yes.  It's a hot piece of ass.  Quite a handful.  Yeah.  The nipples are so sensitive that a mere tweak between finger and thumb will give a perfectly  good result.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  In case you didn't know.  I heard them tell me that this is the free world now. 
[01:22:00]  I told them I had returned to these stars and said I told them how.  And we're back with the O.B. and Anthony program.  The O.A. virus spreading across America thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  XM Satellite Radio is another huge announcement in about a half hour.  It's a biggie.  Jimmy in studio. 
[01:22:30]  Phil Burr in studio.  Anthony not in studio.  He decided to take a leak and I warned him just as he was going into the bathroom that  he is not going to be happy.  Why?  I don't know if it's one of our guys but the bathroom is...  Here, let's get the comment.  How bad was that, Anthony?  I warned him just as...  I was leaving the bathroom as he was going in.  I'm like, dude, you do not want to go in there.  Is that one of our guys in there?  I don't know.  The guy, while I was in there...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You walked in and someone was still in the stall? 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  I don't know who it was then.  Who was it?  I'm going to guess.  It was one of our guys?  Does it begin with an M?  No.  I thought it might be March.  Was it Martini Steve?  It was Steve.  Steve, what the fuck did you eat yesterday at OzFest?  Dude, let me just explain.  Wow.  I took a leak.  Steve was washing his hands when I walked in so I assumed he had just taken a leak.  No, no, no.  I thought the guy, whoever the perpetrator was, had left.  No, no, no.  Usually you would run out, wouldn't you? 
[01:23:30]  You'd wait until no one was in there, listen.  Right.  I took a leak.  Run out, wait five minutes, and then wash your hands later and be like, Jesus.  I took a leak, and it usually takes me less than a minute, and I'm out of the bathroom.  Within that time, you flushed the toilet twice.  What the hell were you dumping?  Oh, boy, Steve.  Dude, that was sitting in me since 7 a.m. yesterday.  The smell in the bathroom, dude.  It's awful.  Well, it's not a shock.  As we're driving to OzFest, he fucking wants to stop.  We stop at a rest area.  He wants to get beef jerky snippets.  I'm like, why would you eat that? 
[01:24:00]  It's 100 degrees out.  You want to stand there and eat this?  That along with berries and honey.  How come beef stings don't bother you?  Yeah, that was just rotten filth festering in me since 24 hours ago.  Now that we smelled it, what did you eat yesterday?  Now I need to know.  I'm trying to remember.  It was, oh, egg whites.  Oh, that was a protein.  God.  That was a protein.  Oh, your system decided to finally release.  Yeah, my system decided to finally release.  I cut down on the egg whites, and now I'm finally dumping more regular. 
[01:24:30]  You know what, it had diffused through the entire bathroom.  It wasn't like you walk past the stall and it was bad, but then you get by the sinks and  it's kind of tolerable.  That stench covered the entire bathroom.  Every nook and cranny of that bathroom.  There was nowhere to go to escape it.  That was a protein-rich egg white dump.  And he tried to pawn it off on someone else.  No, I didn't.  Because Opie walks down the hall.  I'm walking toward the bathroom.  Opie goes, man, it's bad in there.  And I'm like, oh, great, I've got to take a leak.  I walk in. 
[01:25:00]  Now, I had assumed whoever was in there had left.  So I see Steve washing his hands.  So I think Steve was just in there.  And I go, holy shit, it stinks in here.  And Steve goes, yeah, it's pretty bad.  Like someone else did it.  Commiserating.  It was commiserating.  Commiserating with me.  That was your wrong little change person.  Well, I'm really not sure of the etiquette.  Are you supposed to jump up and take credit for it immediately?  Absolutely.  Okay, I apologize.  You should apologize.  I go, boy, it stings in here.  You should have went, oh, sorry.  Okay.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I would have yelled at the office.  Go in there, quick. 
[01:25:30]  Those staples on your stomach are rusting.  Yeah, that was protein and rusty staples.  Jesus.  So how was OzFest, boys?  Wow.  Good time.  I was very happy.  Yeah, Jimmy got to sit down with some of his heroes.  It's going to be very, I predict, it's going to be very tedious audio.  Why?  Because it was, you know, come on, I was shaking.  Were you shaking?  Oh, my God.  Did you go test one, two, and check the tape recorder?  No, but Steve was the one turning it on and off, and every time he did it, I was thinking, 
[01:26:00]  if this is not taping, I'm going to cut his Lebanese head off and kick it.  Yeah, I had a nightmare about that, this thing not taping.  Making sure it worked.  It worked out, yeah.  And the sound quality was good?  Yeah.  The levels were okay?  It wasn't like when Big Kev took it?  No, no, nothing like that.  It's just that every, we had to do these interviews either at the Jaeger tent, which is very noisy,  obviously, because it's outside, or you do them inside the trailers in what's called  Sabbath Village, which is these air conditioning.  Sabbath Village? 
[01:26:30]  Yes.  It's a place that I'd love to live.  You were freely walking around Sabbath Village.  Well, what Sabbath Village is, is this area behind OzFest, Geezer, Tony, Bill, and each  have trailers.  On my first name basis.  Oh, yeah.  My Terrence, actually, instead of Geezer.  They all have a little trailer, and I think Ozzy has just an extra bus, but I think because  they're the musicians, they have a little trailer they can go to behind, off the bus,  only there, back there.  You have to have the complete all-access pass to get back there, where they can just mellow 
[01:27:00]  out, and Bill has a little drum set in his, and I guess Tony has guitars, and it's  unbelievable.  I'd heard about it, but I'd obviously never seen it.  Sabbath Village.  I was interviewing retards next to an inflatable chair.  Yeah, and he's in Sabbath Village.  Who was screaming out, where's Jimmy?  Where's Jimmy?  I heard you, I watched Billy's audio, it was really funny, and then he got some great  stuff, and I realized as I was talking, like, this is going to be interesting to, like,  hardcore Sabbath fans.  The guys were phenomenal, but I mean, I was just, you know, just talking and trying to,  like, just ask a question and let them talk. 
[01:27:30]  Did you have to ask into a mic that you were holding and then put the mic for them?  Yes, I did.  And you did a good job with that?  Yeah, it was, they probably felt like Michael J. Fox was holding it in their face, but I mean.  At one point, I came off better than I thought I would.  Like, I was actually more conversational.  You are?  Yes.  That's good.  Thank God for YSP last week.  Not like an interrogation.  No, no, no, no, and I knew enough about them where it just kind of worked for me.  I was very, I asked a lot of the same questions, though, with the guys.  But you interview a band, it's usually four guys in a room, whatever you wanted to ask  the band, you ask them. 
[01:28:00]  And then each one answers, yeah, but on an individual basis, now you've got to ask a couple  of the same questions.  You have to.  It's hard to have 12 different, you know, I mean, three times whatever questions, 12  different ones.  I hear you.  Right.  I understand.  Why don't we play some of this audio?  We start with Pete, the O&A fan.  Is this Bill Burr's audio?  No, this is, I did a few before, and I handed the mic off to Bill, and then we left Jimmy,  we left Bill at the Jaeger tent, and then Jimmy and I went off and did the Sabbath one.  Before or after you.  Jaeger Village.  Excuse me.  Jaeger Village.  Is this before or after you ate the rancid possum? 
[01:28:30]  Long after.  Oh, after?  Okay.  Just want to make sure.  That was brutal, man.  I got to say it again.  Take full credit for it.  Oh, man.  We actually, rarely in these situations do this work out, but definitely, first of all, Adam  Greyer from Jaeger Meister, everything worked like it was supposed to, the parking.  Like, you know, if you go for VIP parking, you're riding in fucking, and of course we get  there in this scumbag who looks like Sean Penn parking attendant.  I know, VIP's closed. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  And we're like, no, look, little Jaeger Meister, it's okay.  No, no, no, they just called us, it's closed.  What happens, we get on the phone, fucking little Adam, who's just kind of like a short  little, you know, fella, comes out and fucking waves his hands, and we go right through it.  Everything is as it should be.  The O&A van, exactly where it should be.  Did you want to punch the parking guy?  There's another one later I'll get to.  Yeah.  I wanted to sink my teeth into his face.  I was beyond angry with him.  I just wanted to hold him and almost lovingly just bite him.  Yeah, there were a few situations like that where, you know, you got stopped by some low-level 
[01:29:30]  on the totem pole security guy.  But, you know.  Yes.  I want to.  You know, but our names were on every list that they were supposed to be on.  We had the passes we need.  Isn't that great when it works like that?  Well, it almost, and I'll get into it.  This is like a little tease for a problem getting back for the Geezer and Iommi interview because  they weren't going to let us backstage again.  And it was this fucking young kid who, I can't tell you how bad, I still hope that he was 
[01:30:00]  killed on the way home last night.  I hope that he was driving with the other girl who worked there and they were laughing  about something happy.  We have our whole lives ahead of us and all of a sudden, fifth of whiskey right into them.  Right into them with a station wagon and I hope he walked away okay.  He gets charged with manslaughter.  He's out in eight months.  Exactly.  And their young lives are shattered.  Non-list reading motherfuckers. 
[01:30:30]  I hate the whole backstage thing.  I can't.  I can't do it.  It's like walking on eggshells is what it is.  And I know people out there like, you guys are fortunate enough to go backstage to these  concerts.  I was going to be like that.  It stinks.  Nerve wracking.  It stinks on every level.  When you have, they got a sponsor.  I never had a badge at a concert before, which was the sponsor badge for Jägermeister were  phenomenal.  Yeah.  So we go back.  We do one.  We do Bill.  As we're going back, these young, I met one of the guys back there.  I think his name was Mike. 
[01:31:00]  I got to say hello.  He's the boss of all the security guys back there.  I know.  I said Mike.  I can't remember who was Mike.  Huge Opie and Anthony fan.  And so we talked.  He's like, dude, whatever you need back here.  It's yours.  We're going to get back again.  And these fuckers wouldn't let us back.  So they call, they send this monster named Dan out, who again, thank you too, man, who  was also an Opie and Anthony fan.  He goes, dude, just hop on the cart.  You've never seen Satisfaction.  Yeah.  I'm like, dude, we're supposed to be back here.  We're interviewing Geezer and Tony in fucking 10 minutes.  And the guy's like, oh, you're not on the list.  And then he calls her. 
[01:31:30]  He's like, no, not on the list.  And you got to leave.  And the chick, this fucking young chick, who really should be found face down and brushed  somewhere.  Was she hot?  Yeah.  I really wanted to give her hiney a licking, saucy girl.  Saucy, naughty list, Mr. You.  When this kid, Dan, came out in his gray, they were all wearing yellow, but the bosses  wore gray.  When Dan came out, also an Opie and Anthony fan with a cart.  And now we go, look, we're supposed to be back here.  He goes, hop on.  I just wanted to turn around.  You didn't give him a look?  Oh, look. 
[01:32:00]  I mumbled, fuck and cunt.  I was so angry.  Oh, nice.  Geezer and Tony.  I wasn't going back just to, you know, say hello to somebody.  So they got us in.  But the bitches, you know, Jim's name was on the list.  We were on the list.  There's no reason that he should have stopped.  Well, yeah, what list did they say you weren't on?  They're just dummies.  The one they weren't looking at.  They looked at the sponsor badge.  And I'm like, if I said to Dan, we were on the list, he goes, yeah, you're on the list.  And he checked it.  We were on the list.  So, you know, Jaeger and Dan.  The problem with backstage, there's a million lists that don't, they're all different.  Also, this year, apparently, there's six or seven different laminates. 
[01:32:30]  I mean, normally, there's one all-access laminate that you get.  There's six or seven different ones.  And these poor kids are looking at these different pages, at these different...  Poor kids, he's calling them.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, they're really unfortunate.  People don't know how to do their jobs when you're interviewing people you have loved since 1980.  Yeah, you're right, poor kids.  I hope they're both dead.  Actually, no.  I hope they're both below the neck paralyzed and they're still awake.  And all they're hearing are fucking Sabbath songs playing.  Fuckers.  Okay.  Let's play some of the audio.  Dan and Mike, thank you so much.  All right.  But here's Pete, an ONA fan, at OzFest yesterday. 
[01:33:00]  Hey, what's your name?  I'm Pete.  Pete?  Yeah.  Who'd you come here to see?  Sabbath, Shadows Fall, Maiden.  Is it hot enough for you?  Yeah, it's really fucking hot out here.  Now, what were you telling me before?  Who did you want to see come back to the O.B. and Anthony show?  Ramon.  Really?  You enjoy Ramon?  Ramon shit's funny, man.  I'm so happy to hear that.  I'll make sure I tell the guys. 
[01:33:30]  Ramon, bring me some Lysol.  Ooh, that's a good one.  Ramon, light a Steve in here.  Wow.  I'm a Ramon fan, huh?  That was a first.  I was shocked.  Steve hates being with the fans.  You absolutely hate it.  Oh, if there's one person in here that cannot stand our fans, it is Steve hates him.  Yeah, I've gotten a little bit better.  No, you haven't.  All right, fine.  You're a liar. 
[01:34:00]  You are lying.  You're a smelly, shitting liar.  Ramon.  A little sewage in your change, purse, belly.  I'd like some beef jerky tips.  I opted not to have some beef jerky tips.  Eat some rose lip petals or something.  Rose lip?  Did you say?  No, I was going to say rose petals.  I was going to say rose hip.  Very good.  All right, here's Bill Burr interviewing one of the fans. 
[01:34:30]  All right.  What's your name?  Kyle.  Kyle.  You don't need to yell, man.  Just fucking...  Huh?  You don't need to yell.  Sorry, man.  This is a microphone.  Look at this.  This is a state-of-the-art, opiancy microphone.  I'm not going to get the headphones on.  Radio chat.  We got this on the way over here.  What would you do to get back here to meet Jim Norton?  Anything but blow a guy because I'm not gay.  You could still blow a guy and it wouldn't make you gay.  It would just mean you wouldn't enjoy it as much as a homo would.  No.  Well, that's what you got to do. 
[01:35:00]  See that line right there?  Those people aren't waiting to get t-shirts.  I don't even know what's huge now.  I don't even know what's huge now.  You know what?  The middle of my interviews are good, man.  They're really good.  I don't know what this goes to hell.  I'm trying to take Kurt Loder's job.  He's been at MTV for like 30 years.  That was horrendous.  Just standing out this Jaeger tent.  All these out-of-shape, sunburned idiots just standing there.  You're like, what's going on?  Nothing.  Yeah, nothing.  We're here to see you. 
[01:35:30]  Just like, oh, I'm terrible.  Gonna rock today.  Bill, look at this.  J.R. on Long Island from whackbag.com.  Can Bill tell everyone about his website and spell his last name?  He is one of the funniest comedians you have on the show.  It's Bill Burr, right?  B-U-R-R.  B-U-R-R.  So BillBurr.com.  Yeah.  There you go.  B-I-R.  What is he spelling it?  If it doesn't work with one R, try to.  And then give three a whirl.  Like he's cold.  Bill Burr.  Bill Burr.  B-U-R-R-R. 
[01:36:00]  All right.  This is a lot of audio.  You know, I'm sorry to interrupt.  You know what the best part about yesterday was?  Is when you're meeting all the fans, I love shaking hands in 108 degree weather.  I thought of you.  It was like fucking just.  People should have just walked over with their balls exposed and said, here, rub this with  your hand.  It'll give you the same feeling as shaking does.  Just that sweaty, clammy mess.  Wet.  They're all wet hands.  Wet.  Pure wet.  Passing disease.  Oh, the bacteria.  This is a bit of sweat in a Petri dish and just throw it in your face.  The bacteria shaking hands as they change positions from your hand to his. 
[01:36:30]  After a few minutes, I would lick my palms clean.  Bill Burr interviews Peter from Soilwork.  Is this worth playing?  Because we have a lot of audio.  Yeah.  You know what I did?  I started asking them to do, if it's the second, from the second one in, I had them  do like little PSAs.  Is this good?  No.  This was the first guy you interviewed.  I think the guy from Sweden.  And you were asking him if he ever got into fights with the other guitar player. 
[01:37:00]  The very first band interview you did, I think.  Oh, yeah.  I think I would go to the next one.  Go to the next one?  Yeah.  One of the ones with the PSAs was good.  All right.  Well, the next clip here is Steve, again, Martini Steve, interviewing the O&A fans outside  the Jägermeister booth.  Yeah, this is just two obnoxious O&A fans.  What's your name?  George Gronning.  George, what's your favorite thing about today?  Fucking meeting Jim Norton, meeting Steve C., everybody from O&A, dude.  It's awesome.  That's not really what I was fishing for.  I was kind of looking for something about the whole rock concert thing that's going on here. 
[01:37:30]  The rock concert's awesome, but O&A is the shit.  Who are you, sir?  I'm Reggie.  Reggie, where are you from?  I'm from Jackson.  You know it's rude to interrupt.  That's okay.  I love XM, I love Jimmy, I love O&A.  That's fantastic.  What band did you come here to see?  Iron Maiden.  Really?  No other band?  I'm old, so...  That's a lot of bands to sit through just for Iron Maiden.  I'm going to see Zombie, I'm going to see Maiden, I'm going to see Black Label, and I'm going to see Black Sabbath. 
[01:38:00]  Now you're interrupting, sir.  That's very rude.  What band did you come here to see?  Black Sabbath, he's from the same town, Jackson, Zach Wild, Black Sabbath, Black Label Society, and fucking Zombie.  Thank you, sir.  That ended my...  I can hear them sweating.  Yeah.  You could hear that one guy especially sweating, and just, he's out of breath.  Jackson, Jackson. 
[01:38:30]  Ready to just collapse from the heat.  You got a lot accomplished there.  Yeah, I know.  And that ended my fan interviews.  That was it, you were disgusted.  I couldn't stand it anymore.  The O&A response, Adam said he was very...  He didn't say he was surprised, he said it was very strong when the van pulled in, because I didn't see the van.  And he said it was amazing how the response...  A lot of those...  Yeah, I mean...  There's so many people out there still thinking that we're doing this cute little thing for XM.  They have no idea how big this is getting already.  Ugh.  No clue.  They gave away a box of shirt. 
[01:39:00]  Ugh.  Ugh.  You...  I just looked over, and all I saw was Eric's mouth with bacon and mayonnaise dripping from it, hanging out of it.  You looked like you were bobbing for apples in the fucking Planned Parenthood dumpster.  Oh, my God.  That's right.  Now I'm going to make a conscious effort to keep that mouth closed. 
[01:39:30]  Look at them.  Old pursed lips.  What is that, Adam?  A little fip.  A little straw.  What are you sure to know?  It's bacon.  It's turkey.  What's on there?  There's more than BLT there.  There's turkey or something.  That's all bacon?  That's bacon.  That is a slab of bacon.  That's going to be a smell.  Chris, go on top.  Your dump is going to be worse than Steve's.  I was just going to say.  With all that mayo.  You thought mine was smelly with you.  It's too hot to be eating mayo.  You can't take a chance like that.  At least keep your mouth closed.  You're fucking chewing and yodeling at the same time. 
[01:40:00]  He's got mayo packets on the side just in case he needs more mayonnaise.  Nothing better on a hot day.  Eric's innards, I'd love to get in there and just look around.  One time we were just chit-chatting and he was having a sandwich, and there wasn't quite  enough fucking heart clogger on his sandwich, so he sucked the mayo out of the package.  Did you really suck the mayo out of the little mayo packets?  He does that just about every day.  He loves mayo.  He loves that mayo.  It's just awful.  He doesn't like to waste either.  It's not good.  No.  You should be a big, fat guy. 
[01:40:30]  Working on it.  He's all the stuff you eat.  He's young right now, but you wait.  Eric, you give him a few years.  How young a lad are you?  27.  What?  27.  27?  And he's already been in radio, what, 12 years?  10.  10?  I knew you started yelling.  27's when you start to go down.  The big 3-0 is when the body starts changing.  The stuff you were able to do in your 20s, you're not able to do in your 30s because it  just packs it on.  A few years, you're going to be singing W-O-L-D by Harry Chapin. 
[01:41:00]  Now you've got a tie around your gut and you're doing high school.  All right.  Enjoy.  We've got some audio from Zach Wild.  There's so much here.  I don't know which ones to play.  What do you think, Steve?  Um, let's see.  What tracks are the, the, he got, uh...  How are you dealing with the heat?  Is that good?  Nah, that was just, that was at first just because Zach, Zach and his whole crew he rolls  with are all dressed up in tight black leather, you know, vests and...  Did you just say his crew that he rolls with? 
[01:41:30]  You gotta see these guys.  Yeah, I did say that.  Eek.  Sorry.  He's got his whole entourage is, is roll...  Ramon, bring me some hip-hop dialect.  That was hip-hop?  That was worse than that shit you just took.  Wouldn't you just say the guys he hangs out with?  Yeah, he's rolling with.  But it's, he and his boys, word is bond, we're very hot.  His posse, if you will.  That's correct. 
[01:42:00]  Let's see, the, um...  You gotta hear from...  You gotta hear from your rolls with.  Give me that sandwich, I want to mush it in Steve's eye.  Zach to the wild.  Zach to the wild.  Oh, he talks about...  No, Zach, y'all been playing for quite a while.  Y'all been representing.  Jesus.  You're finding it hard to hold it down?  I want to paralyze you with a rock.  I'm sorry, Jim.  I want to hear, is there the opening salvo, the first question, no matter what it's about 
[01:42:30]  or anything, I just want to hear Jimmy's first question.  Zach just started talking.  We did Bill Ward first, and then we did Zach.  And Zach's an animal, he's familiar with the show.  He bathes, I'm sure, at times.  He's just a sweaty, and he doesn't care.  But he sits down, he just starts going.  Yeah.  Yeah, Zach doesn't care.  It's a pretty easy interview.  Good.  We asked him about the whole Dimebag thing, like, has he changed the way they deal with  touring or security since the whole Dimebag?  Oh, that's a good question. 
[01:43:00]  Well, I had a stupid moment with that, too.  I didn't know.  I've seen part of the video, which is called In This River, Track 7, yeah.  It's a really cool video, which became like a Dimebag tribute, but I didn't know.  Someone told me that those were Dimebag's kids in the video, because I saw it for a  minute.  Really?  At that Ozfest.  So I asked him about that, and it turns out Dimebag didn't have kids, so I felt like a dick.  I mean, he wasn't a dick about it, but I was like, ugh.  All right, let's go to the audio here.  You have an amazing show of force here.  I mean, it's fucking, it's like a compound here, man.  I mean, there's nobody going to cause a problem here.  Did that scare you and make you want to bring more people and go that there are some crazy 
[01:43:30]  people out there?  I better make sure I'm a little bit, you know, surrounded with people, or did it not  affect the way you do business at all?  No, not at all, man.  Uh-oh.  I mean, that's why I would never, I would never go down to a show and hurt any, you know,  like, I would never go down to an Ozzy show and hurt an Ozzy, you know, when I was  a fan, you know what I mean?  I still am, but I mean, it's just like, here, you're going down to see Randy  Rhodes, you don't hurt Randy Rhodes, you know, you go down, yeah, without a doubt,  you know, all we do is go up there and, like, high-five every solo Randy does, you know  what I mean?  Because you're seeing greatness, you know what I mean? 
[01:44:00]  So, there you go.  I already hate my own voice.  I already, I'm listening to this, and I'm wishing that Steve would just have the fortitude to  take my head and crack my teeth against the console.  You did fine, Jim.  I got a security company.  Fucking rambling asshole.  I love it.  Happy to be there.  Now I can't wait to hear more, Jimmy.  Dude, it's awful.  You are really a stammering ass.  And there was one point, I mean, with Zach, I wasn't that nervous, because Steve was holding  the mic.  And it was good, too, because sometimes I would ask a question, and then he would hold 
[01:44:30]  the mic by my mouth while he just went into a fucking place where he's scooping honey  out of a pot.  Fucking creep.  And Zach is talking, and I actually had to move his hand once.  Like, you know, the one with the mouth moving and the sound coming out of it?  That's the one you hold the mic.  That happens once.  Large grizzly.  Let's go to Kevin in Philly.  I guess he's a new fan.  Kevin, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  I'm just a little curious about the story behind this whole Ramon thing is. 
[01:45:00]  What, buddy?  You don't know who Ramon is?  I'm telling you, we're getting new listeners every day.  That's the weird thing.  All right, quickly.  I've been listening for a couple months, and I love you guys, and this is the first time  I've ever heard that.  Quickly, quickly, quickly.  Ramon is part of a promo that Steve does for the show.  You know those little promos, those little humorous, little sound things that are dropped  in every so often during the show?  Well, this is nothing like them.  Hey, we can play a quick Ramon promo for you.  Hold on, hold on.  I'm going to play a promo for you. 
[01:45:30]  Rich guy and his house boy is what it is.  Ramon is the house boy.  Let me play this, and then we'll explain.  Hit it.  That's great.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony.  Ooh, it's in my shoes.  Ramon, clean this up.  See, now he's the rich voice guy that does voiceover work for movies or wherever they  need voiceover work, and his house boy is Ramon, and he does unspeakable things just  to satisfy the old man.  Great.  Sounds good. 
[01:46:00]  Exactly.  You know, Kevin, I'm with you.  That is my perfect reaction.  Great.  Sounds good.  Sounds good on paper.  And your next question should be, I listened to this show.  Why?  Can you pay for those cell phone minutes?  All right, Kevin.  All right, anything else for the Zach Wilde interview we want to play?  Anything else?  How about anything at all?  I'm telling you, I'm a bad interviewer.  Anything with Jimmy on it.  Well, there's so much audio.  I don't know if we can get to all of this.  I'm trying to just get to the... 
[01:46:30]  Talks about going with double duty.  He's very respectful towards Ozzy.  He talks about a prank he pulled in Philly where he wore a dress with his whole...  He brought his whole group of guys into a mall in Philly.  Group of guys?  Yeah, Zach loves homo humor.  Yeah, he does.  He lives for gay humor.  Yeah.  He's a big biker.  They love that shit.  And by that, you mean the crew.  Yes.  That he's rolling with.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm not going to get out of that one.  They were dressed like biz itches.  All right, let's play the audio from the prank here, all right? 
[01:47:00]  You did something in a dress.  I don't...  It was fucking...  It was in Philadelphia.  I mean, Kim from YSP was in love with you.  It was telling me that you did something in a dress.  I don't know what it was.  Did you go on stage in a dress or did you do something in public with a dress?  It was completely uncalled for.  Something in a dress.  Anything in a dress.  Anything in a dress?  Anything with a D in it?  It's definitely...  Oh, no.  Come on.  Fucking asshole.  Humna, humna, humna, humna.  Just so happy to be communicating.  Myself sick.  I love it.  Come on.  Shop for the future.  Dude, I knew it, too.  I fucking knew this was going to happen.  It was just going to be...  No.  It's fine.  I mean, I'm a good...  It's adorable is what it is. 
[01:47:30]  It's like a big clock right behind whoever he's interviewing in 10 seconds.  You will be kicked off this class.  I'm on.  When did you start?  When did you start?  You play guitar?  You had a dress.  You wore a dress.  You had bought a dress.  Something with a dress.  It's like on the $25,000 pyramid with Zach Wilde.  Something with a dress.  You wore a dress.  You had a dress.  Things guys like a homo do?  Pass.  Pass on.  I got to hear the beginning of this again.  On behalf of...  All right, listen again.  You did something with a dress. 
[01:48:00]  I don't...  It was fucking...  It was in Philadelphia.  I mean, Kim from YSP was in love with you.  It was telling me that you did something with a dress.  I don't know what it was.  Did you go on stage with a dress?  Or did you do something with a couple of different dresses?  It was real...  I don't even need the answer.  I don't even...  He said dress like 18 times.  No, it's something with a dress.  Dad, dad.  Zach, what's your address?  I need something with a dress.  Oh, God.  And hit the bell every time he says dress, right?  Any of this question?  I want to try to hear the rest of it.  You did something with a dress.  I don't...  It was fucking... 
[01:48:30]  It was in Philadelphia.  I mean, Kim from YSP was in love with you.  It was telling me that you did something with a dress.  I don't know what it was.  Did you go on stage with a dress?  Did you do something in public with a dress?  It was really completely uncalled for and hilarious.  He tried to, like, reshape that question every time he started to ask it.  Like, no, that's not the right approach.  Let's try this approach.  Fuck that.  Abort.  Abort.  Go to this way.  Go this way.  Somebody else.  Someone else told me about the dress.  No, I knew about the dress. 
[01:49:00]  It was hysterical with the dress.  We wear dresses sometimes.  You're a fan of the birdcage.  Oh, is that fantastic?  Oh, we're just...  We're smashing your face.  We should have been down there helping out with this whole thing, but...  You could hear his little heart pounding.  Oh, he's freaking out.  It was.  You kept waiting for them to realize, wait a minute.  You're Jimmy Norton.  Go away.  Just leave.  Old Jimmy Norton.  Oh, I kept waiting for my professional mask to fall off.  You did something in a dress. 
[01:49:30]  I don't...  It was fucking...  It was in Philadelphia.  I mean, Kim from YSP, who was in love with you, was telling me that you did something  in a dress.  I don't know what it was.  Did you go on stage in a dress?  Did you do something in public with a dress?  It was really completely uncalled for and hilarious.  I think it was uncalled for.  Oh, fuck.  That's going to piss him off.  And hilarious.  Uncalled for.  And hilarious.  Don't hit me.  Don't kick me out.  Don't kick me out.  Yeah, this is my moment.  Don't kick me out, please.  Every question I ask has to have a disclaimer.  Oh, I know.  Believe me.  I love it.  I'm a worm.  I absolutely love it.  It is the cutest interview ever, Jimmy. 
[01:50:00]  It's just awful.  Don't you worry about it.  TV.  I love this new character.  Stuttering Jimmy.  Want to hear the answer?  Who cares about that?  I know.  That's what I'm thinking.  Here's Zach Wilde.  But if it was, I'm sure it was us.  If it was definitely gay, I'm sure we pulled it off.  Of course.  You know, when you've got guys that are weighing about 265, 250, 245, you know, with dresses  that they're bursting out of.  No, we've got to make sure the dresses are for, like, a 13-year-old pubescent girl, you 
[01:50:30]  know what I mean?  So it's like, it says he didn't have puberty yet, so, you know.  She said you went to a mall.  You were in a mall or something like that with a dress, and you had, like, your train wallet.  She said it was, like, the most ridiculous thing she's ever seen in the world.  That's where it was at.  Yeah, it was out in, um...  Why are you talking so fast?  Oh, my God.  We haven't got...  A mile a minute, Jimmy.  You were in a mall.  Was it a strip mall?  Was it a big mall?  All kidding aside, were you just...  Freaking in this mall.  Were you just freaking out inside?  Was your adrenaline just racing through your veins?  I talk a little quickly.  Yeah.  I'm scared. 
[01:51:00]  And it was...  I'm scared.  It was Zach's boss.  Zach was going on.  We did have to press for time with him because his whole family was there, and he did have to  go on soon.  He was going to do a signing and then go on.  So the guy was...  His brother was really cool, but he's like, look, he's got to kind of be quick just because we have a signing  and then at the show.  So I was like, kind of knew that.  And his dad walked on the bus just as we got there, like two minutes after we got there.  What a nice guy his father was, too.  Hi, boys!  You know, just a friend.  His father's just World War II vet.  Very cool guy.  But all of a sudden, Zach wants to go hang with his family, and we're in there.  You want to ask questions about dresses? 
[01:51:30]  He's got family there.  What do you ask Zach, though?  I mean, he played with Ozzy.  What am I going to do that's anything remotely interesting?  I've been interviewed to the...  I've had that.  I've been on the other side.  Yeah.  And I know that the thing I normally like is I hate when interviewers try to be funny with me.  It never fucking makes me laugh.  I just want to ask a question.  Ask me a question.  Let me answer when I'm finished.  Ask the next one.  Let me talk until I'm done.  That's what I like in an interview.  Well, we missed the obvious.  We have to go to John in Jersey.  John, go ahead.  Yeah, Norton, you sound like Johnson Edwards from Crossing Over.  Crossing Over? 
[01:52:00]  I'm getting a D.  I'm getting a D.  I'm getting something.  I'm getting a dress.  Something with a dress.  Does somebody in here wear a dress or had a dress?  Did the departed wear a dress?  Some type of dress.  Something with a D.  Dignity.  Does anybody have a D?  I really could use a helping.  Oh, is that great.  He's coming in like crazy.  He sounds like John Edwards.  That's funny.  And then Byron.  What's up, Byron?  Hey, boys.  Hey, Jimmy.  I want to know if that's you or Rain Man doing the interview. 
[01:52:30]  I'm punching out.  All right.  I've got to back up a little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  I'm going to back up a little bit.  He was just scared is what everyone's saying.  Of course I was.  Leave Jimmy alone.  He was scared.  She said you went to a mall.  You were in a mall or something like that with a dress and you had like your chain wallet.  She said it was like the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen.  That's where it was at.  Yeah, it was out in Boston where we were hanging out.  Yeah, but it was in a mall.  Something like that.  Sounds like Chris Farley character.  A bunch of grown men.  That happened.  That was awesome.  And we made sure.  You wore a dress. 
[01:53:00]  You wore a dress.  It was awesome.  But yeah, it was definitely beyond gay.  It was a bunch of grown men and we made sure.  Yeah, we went to like a Victoria's Secret and just got the most insane.  No, where you're just, you know, I can get you in the smallest stuff that like a 13-year-old  will wear.  Oh, of course.  And you're just bursting out of these dresses and everything like that.  It was awesome.  You just gave him an idea.  No.  13-year-old in Victoria's Secret.  That's nice.  Yeah.  All right.  Are we done with Zach Wilde, do you think?  Anything else that comes to mind here, guys? 
[01:53:30]  Great.  I think that's it.  I think he was just really, you realize that he's very respectful towards Ozzy, so if Ozzy  asked him to come back and stop doing what he was doing, he'd go and do it, you know.  In a second.  Yeah.  In a second.  And he's doing, they're doing really well, man.  Do you have anything else you want us to play from that?  No, it's fine, man.  It was just, he's just a fun, he's fun to have in the studio because he's just an animal.  He's a fucking animal.  We must save those.  Go through the questions.  Oh, no.  We got tons more.  We got the Bill Ward interview, the Tony Iommi interview, and then we got some more of 
[01:54:00]  the Bill Burr stuff.  I got to say, best thing I got, I got people to do PSAs.  That I want to hear.  Yeah.  All right.  PSAs.  Should we take a quick break?  What do you got there?  I was just going to say, these guys, we obviously play only small clips, gave us, Bill Ward gave  us over 30 minutes total.  Iommi, who was the shortest, gave us almost 10 minutes, and Geezer, 17 minutes.  These guys gave us a lot of time.  That's pretty nice.  And I got a plea before, from Sanctuary Records, Kevin, how do you say, is it Chairmate?  Chairmante.  Chairmante. 
[01:54:30]  Fucking hooked this whole thing up.  You can't get near Sabbath on show days.  And he used all of his powers and all of his skills.  All of his skills.  And he was there for us the whole time, man.  Kevin, thank you so, so much for helping us at Sanctuary.  It sounds like you had a great time.  It was fucking...  Dream come true.  Yeah, between all the guys at that Yeager, Adam at Yeager, that helped us, all the people  at Clear Channel that got us passes and passed all the guards, the security guys, everything  fell into place as it should have.  First time it ever actually all worked.  Yeah.  It never always worked.  And at this time, everybody was on the ball and fucking helped us. 
[01:55:00]  Always getting screwed.  Always walking on eggshells.  Except for that one cunt.  Well, yeah, the guy and the girl.  But in fairness to them, they were young and they didn't know any better.  But the guys with the gray shirts, Dan and Mike.  All right, let's say hi to Rick in Minnesota.  Rick.  What's going on, fellas?  How are you?  Not too bad.  I got some wacky radio for you.  All right.  Cool.  These girls are fake moaning for some Def Leppard tickets.  Nice.  Hold on a second. 
[01:55:30]  Why did you pop afterwards?  What the hell was that?  That was just weird.  That was just weird.  So the people at the home let you make one phone call, huh?  Yeah, I like this.  Oh, my God.  That sounded like a...  Is she still on the line?  Yeah, she did it again there for us.  Sounded like a retarded kid going down a hill on a slide or something.  So, man, we've got to get some info from you.  Yeah.  Yeah, we do.  Faking it for Def Leppard.  Stay where you are. 
[01:56:00]  Stay where you are.  93X.  Yeah, stay right where you're supposed to be.  The authorities will be there shortly.  All right.  Why do you girls got to do it now?  Ashley.  How come Ashley and Jessica aren't going to partake?  Well, we'll give you some help.  All right.  You go, and then we'll play something in the background.  They don't want to...  They're not interested.  Good.  They don't do it.  We're a wholesome girl.  That's good.  I'm glad to hear it.  We like that.  We like that.  Family rescue.  Is Kassi going to do it for us this morning, then, or now?  Is she out, too?  She's shy.  I don't know how to fake it.  Oh!  Oh, hey now! 
[01:56:30]  That's outrageous!  Shit, I said no hot fake head!  Another show with a chick in the studio.  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Is this Minnesota?  Yeah.  Well, that's a different grudge.  I'll put her in.  But, you know what?  What if we did that?  Okay?  Yeah.  And then we can...  This is going to be the best.  This might send one of us over to town. 
[01:57:00]  Can we get this right?  Uh-oh.  Getting in this.  Oh, you throw in Maria Sharapova.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, man.  You close your eyes.  It's like a dream come true.  I'm such a fan of women's professional tennis.  Jeez, you've got to know it.  I love it.  Sounds like a weekend over at Culpepper's place.  All righty.  Well, Jessica and Ashley.  Is that right? 
[01:57:30]  Yep.  Thanks for coming in.  Thanks for coming in.  Yeah, those outfits are awesome.  You can see...  How was that, guys?  Thank you, I guess.  So, what was going on?  They were moaning for Def Leppard tickets?  Yeah.  I don't know what the whole deal is, but yeah, they needed a moan for Def Leppard tickets.  And yesterday was really good.  They had some really good ones.  And this morning, they had some couple of really retarded soundy ones. 
[01:58:00]  You know what would make her moan real good?  If you chopped her arm off for Def Leppard tickets.  Yeah, no kidding.  Yeah, they were talking about that earlier today on...  Like, they were talking about, oh, how the hell could girls even, you know, fake it and  stuff like that?  And one of the other guys that was in there was like, oh, maybe you guys just ain't able  to please them.  They had a bunch of girls from Hooters that were in there.  Ah!  And they were like, oh, yeah, you know, we dressed up and stuff.  And I've never faked it before.  It's like, bullshit. 
[01:58:30]  Every fucking person, every girl out there always has.  Hey, Rick, is that one of your big shows out there in Minnesota?  Yeah, what's the name of the show?  It's a 93X Half-Ass Morning Show.  Half-Ass Morning Show.  It's actually pretty good.  It ain't too shabby.  I've listened to it for a while.  Yeah, how about that?  And then I just got XM for about eight months ago and listened to you guys and the replays.  It's awesome.  All right, thank you, sir.  Yeah, no problem, man.  All right, we love the wacky radio alerts.  The fact that he said not too shabby makes me want to take a razor and cut his gum line. 
[01:59:00]  Wacky radio alerts on the O.P. Anthony program.  What?  Type it there, James.  What's that about?  Line number one.  It wasn't showing up on the screen.  What about James?  We're not going there anymore.  We're not going there anymore.  We beat that guy up in here.  We're not going there anymore.  All right, so we'll take a break and we'll get into Jimmy Norton interviewing Bill Ward and Tony Iommi after the break.  How's that?  And I don't know where the geezer is. 
[01:59:30]  It's not cut up yet.  It's not cut up.  Oh, it's not cut up?  All right.  It will be.  And we're trying to get Eric Logan, ELO, on the phone because XM just announced a huge deal with Napster.  Huge deal with Napster?  Napster.  A big deal with Napster.  Napster and us with a big deal?  Napster?  Well, a lot of the XM players that are coming out, one was announced yesterday and there's going to be others announced, I guess.  They're going to have MP3 capability.  Yes.  So you can download the music onto the same thing that you're listening to live satellite radio. 
[02:00:00]  Technology.  So it's a huge announcement we're partnering up with Napster.  I actually prefer, and I know I have an iPod and stuff, but Napster, the thing I like about the new Napster is I don't mind paying for the songs, but for some reason, fucking iTunes, I don't know how it is on most PCs, screws up and it starts to screw up when it plays.  My media player is a lot better, so I'm going to actually switch over to that.  Absolutely, yeah.  Not just because of the big deal, but it sounds better.  So that's really cool.  You know, you've got something like the MiFi, you're listening to live programming, you're also listening to the program you record into your MiFi. 
[02:00:30]  I'm just using MiFi as an example because that's the one I use.  And eventually, then you're also going to have the MP3 capability as well.  That's just amazing.  By the end of the year, I guess, you'll have all of that going on in one unit.  And Sirius, by the way, has just announced a big deal with Kazaa, so you can go online and download shit videos if you want to.  The hotline's ringing.  I have no idea who this is. 
[02:01:00]  Is it Elo?  Hello?  I was trying to beat Danny to the punch.  Hello?  Oh, he's got it.  Now he's got to scream the call.  Oh, they're saying, who is it?  Ben's making the hand-to-the-throat thing like, no, no, no.  Don't talk about who's on the hotline.  No, don't even talk about it.  Don't go to the hotline.  Oh, my God, whatever you do.  Who's on the hotline?  Who's on the hotline?  Don't pick it up.  The call's coming from inside the house.  That's right.  It's Earl.  Earl?  Oh, then you were 100% right.  Yes, stay away from that. 
[02:01:30]  Thank you, Ben.  You did save the show.  Why is he calling the hotline?  Ugh.  Earl is anti-entertainment.  If it gets near entertainment, it cancels it out and could destroy the whole universe.  Awful man.  All right, we'll try to talk to Elo about this Napster deal.  It seems like it's another big one for XM.  And we'll get back into the audio after this.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday. 
[02:02:00]  How about that woman who took his shirt off?  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  Show us your fun days.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  Oh, it's fantastic. It's definitely beautiful.  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday. It's Ripple Mal Wednesday. It's Ripple Mal Wednesday. 
[02:02:30]  You can't see your appointment.  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday. It's Ripple Mal Wednesday. It's Ripple Mal Wednesday.  Stay out the bushes.  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday. It's Ripple Mal Wednesday.  It's Weaver Melvin's Day  Oh, yeah  Opian Anthony, XM202  Hi, welcome back to the Opian Anthony show 
[02:03:00]  We got girls moaning, we're going to have that for a while  Matt from Attleboro, Mass  Said, holy shit  That guy should be given credit  For the wacky show, the guy that called in  It's the first time this bit's ever been done  And it really worked 
[02:03:30]  Clear phone, timely manner  Stupid bit  And his dumb ass isn't constantly talking  So, yeah, that guy that called up with the wacky bit  Job well done  Bravo  We're always talking about how that bit never works  Because the people are such idiots that try to put their phone  They either keep the phone too far from the speaker  And they're going, you guys getting this?  You hear it?  Do you hear  Or it's right next to the speaker  So you're just picking up, like, the magnetic resonance  From the magnet in the speaker 
[02:04:00]  Wasn't that wacky?  Zany, right?  Didn't hear shit, idiot  Yeah, he did it  He did it properly  Because we really do love that bit  Yeah, when it's a stupid, wacky radio bit  When it's done right, it's great  Okay  Alright, we did that  So what do you want to play next?  Bill  Huh?  Yeah, Bill  Bill  You want to save the bill  This stuff?  Yeah  Save this or play this?  No, no  The stuff that Bill recorded 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, that one  Drunk 018 fans  Bill's got to leave soon  You have to leave soon?  Yeah, I have an audition for a wacky sitcom at 11  Zanerific  Anything you could talk about?  Who's involved in the project?  Oh, is there anybody connected?  Attached to it?  Attached to it, that's the word  Anyone attached to this one?  No big names yet  No, no big names yet?  No  This is a sitcom  They never even make it to air anymore  No, not at all  It's got to be a reality show  You took ten guys auditioning for that part  And put it in a fucking house 
[02:05:00]  Had them all lit together  Then it's a show  You guaranteed 16 episodes  Or whatever it is  Isn't that just disgusting?  There's nothing really good  But I'm guilty of watching a couple of these  Like the stupid  And the stupidest ones  Like that stupid cooking one  I've been watching the stupid cooking show  With the English guy that yells all the time  And just, you know  Every episode it's the same thing  Get on your station  Get back to your station  And then the restaurant goes so bad  That the orders are taking an hour to get out 
[02:05:30]  And he always ends with  Shut it down  And they close the whole restaurant  And kick the patrons out  They kick everyone out  They didn't get their order  I always watch that  That one where they make the customized motorcycles  What's this?  Oh yeah  American Chopper  It's the same episode every time  Every single goddamn time  Carburettor doesn't fit  What do you mean it doesn't fit?  Doesn't fit  Oh, dad's going to be pissed  But Carburettor doesn't fit  Well, why didn't you get the right part?  You guys got to get this bike done by tomorrow  Well, maybe if you did something 
[02:06:00]  Instead of just sitting around  I was here until 10pm last night  They're always just yelling  And then they always finish the bike  And then, you know  I was real happy  I was real psyched the way he thought about it  And then next week  Same shit  Same shit  Spark plug isn't going to fit in that  What do you mean?  I watch it every fucking time  Every week  Every week  It's always the same bike  With that big fat tire in the back  You think the father  Spider-Man kind of shit  You think the father could still take his son?  Oh, the  I don't know 
[02:06:30]  They're both  He's fucking old school, man  Yeah  He'd throw a beat  Like a crowbar or something  A two by four  Yeah, grab a piece of wood  And hit him with it  Take a chain to his own family member  That's a fucking old school dude  Is that true?  Gordon Ramsay is on the show on a Monday?  Yeah, we got him  The chef guy from  Hell's Kitchen  Hell's Kitchen  Dave in Jersey  What's up, Dave?  Hey, Bill  I just wanted to say hi to Bill  And say I saw a show in Baltimore  About a month ago  And it was an awesome show  Yeah, you and 16 other people  Thanks for showing up, man  It was the show with those idiot girls 
[02:07:00]  Who were in the front row  Who were unwrapping their presents  During the show  You had girls unwrapping  What was it, like a party?  A little shower or something?  Oh, yeah, yeah  The bachelorette party  Oh, you cunt  And they brought the presents to the comedy?  And they were like literally  Having their party  While I was on stage  In front of like 20 people  Can you  Oh, my God, Manny  Thank you  That was so sweet  I got some lingerie  From Victoria's Secret  Where's Richard Speck  When you need him?  Oh, I can't believe it 
[02:07:30]  A dress  You got me a dress  I love a dress  Where'd you get this dress?

Oh, Jesus  It was horrendous  Crinkle, crinkle, crinkle  Oh, Phil's doing his act  In front of this  Oh, it was terrible  You fucking bitches  You guys don't get  You don't get paid enough  You know, it's funny that it happens so often  I can't even remember  Like I vaguely remember that  You guys are just shit on that stage  You're trash to these people 
[02:08:00]  They're going out for a night  They don't care what you're doing  What goals you have in life  Your act that you work on  To get up there and do  To them, you're just  Blah, blah  Background conversation  Then when you snap on them  They can't believe it  Yeah  Well, we paid to come in here  We weren't talking to him  The balls of you  To actually snap on them  You're fucking interrupting  The whole thing here  Holy shit  This is why I hate audiences  Because you come out to be entertained  And you never take any responsibility 
[02:08:30]  For the fact that you may not be entertained  Like sometimes we suck  You know, as Billy will know  Sometimes we're bad  But other times it's their fault  And that table of whores  Would never take responsibility  For the fact that they probably  Didn't hear half his joke  No  He'll yell at them  And they'll go  Well, you're not funny  That's why we're not laughing  It's like, no, you fucking wholes  You're talking  They'll go home  They will go home and say  You know, hey  Oh, you went to the comedy club last night?  How was it?  Oh, it's not that funny  The hot girls are the worst  Because no one has ever told them 
[02:09:00]  To shut the fuck up in their life  So it's almost like guys' fault  That they're like such cunts  Because no one has ever just stepped to them  We have to take responsibility  Yes  For their bitchiness  So they have like this look  Like they can't even believe it  Then they try to get like support  From other people around  Oh, can you believe  Every guy at the table supports them  Right  Because they're still trying to fuck them  Yeah, yeah  It's just terrible  Oh, ugh  Guys are the weasels  They really are disgusting  They just stick up for these broads  Hey, you know, she's a bitch  She's a lady  I had one guy  I was working on my

[02:10:00]  What an ass  And I think  When I realized he was serious  Of course  Then I cursed  Yeah  I know these ladies  I'm trying to fuck them  You know  Then it got ugly  And I really wanted to  I just wanted to fucking take this guy  And just poke my finger into his chest  Tone it down  Do you know where you are?  You idiot  And I wasn't cursing  Yeah  I was doing the massage bit  Which killed an NBC, by the way  And he was a little offended  He was offended 
[02:10:30]  Because there are ladies here  There are ladies here  Literally trying to get some pussy  Dude, by making you look like  At your expense  That phony chivalry  Yes, exactly  Hey, did you see how I took care of that guy?  You girls, you know  I don't like that you're hearing this  He was a little older, too  He wasn't like a young  He wasn't like a young wise  There's nothing worse  Than one of those fucking wise guys  Tries to act like  I'm a gentleman  Hey, there's a lady here  Oh, sorry  You weren't extorting somebody  At the moment, shithead?  A lady here  And then they get out  What the fuck are you doing?  You cunt  You almost scratched my fucking car

[02:12:00]  And it was real when he did it  I mean, he was like  Yes, he got arrested  If you're on stage  Doing like poopy jokes though  You're not really shocking people  In this day and age  Yeah  Lenny was trying to desensitize  He said that  You know, this is just words  I'm trying to take this thing out of them  And he meant it  It was a sincere thing  In 1958 and 60  Right  When you see comics doing it today  They're trying to be  And stealing just what he said  I've seen people  I'm not going to mention  Any females names  But I've seen people  Kind of stealing the same tone  And the same speech  About how this is what I'm trying  That's not what you're trying to do  Right 
[02:12:30]  You're just giving an excuse  For stolen jokes  You're trying to get away with it  And that's your asterisk  You see, I'm just trying to  You know what I mean  It's like you see  Yeah  Oh yeah, there's nothing worse  Than the dangerous comic  They always have like  The fucking  Three quarter leather  It's like July  And they got a cigarette  Dangerous  Oh, it's  The fucking worst  Wow  It's all black guys  Have big dick jokes  And Chinese people can't drive  There's no insight to any of it  You know who does  And then you tag every joke  What?

All right, we need to start that again  So I don't look like I  You hear that and go  No, fuck it  Just keep going, man  I'm like a retarded  I got no reference there  So how do you think  Your set's going to go tonight?  Are you looking forward?  Are you on the main stage?  Yeah  Are you over there?  I think it's going to go great  I mean, we always put in 150%  And, you know  It's a bit different  Playing from  A sitting down crowd  But still  It's going to be great  So far  All the shows  It's been amazing  So I'm pretty sure 
[02:29:30]  Today will be as well  So you guys  Are you like your vibe?  Are you more mellow?  Melodic?  Is that like how you guys are?  I think we're metal  It's hard to categorize us  Into one  Basically  Okay  All right  So you're not like  Iron Maiden meets  You're not like  Pitch movies and stuff  You're like  Iron Maiden meets  I guess we could say that  But it would be unfair  Probably to just  Categorize it into one  You know  I don't like that  We're metal bad  All right  That's cool, man  That's cool  How long have you guys been playing?  A long time  Now since 
[02:30:00]  I think it's like  Twelve years  Something  Like twelve years?  Out of everybody in the band  If you had to kill someone  Who would you kill?  Myself  You'd kill yourself  At the road sign  To get to you?  No, no  But I mean  It wouldn't be fair to the others  Otherwise  Choose one  I like this guy  This guy  I can tell  You're like the peacekeeper  In the band, right? 
[02:30:30]  You're like the mellow one  Listen, man  We're also doing  This is kind of a side thing  We're kind of doing  This benefit  Somebody beat up  A special needs kid  In like Newark  And so  We just want you  To just say  You know  Just give a shout out  To the kids  So they know  Not to beat up  Somebody with like  You know  Special needs  You know  So just  You know  Just say like  You know  Hey guys  You know  It's not cool  To beat up  With somebody  Just because  They're different  Or whatever  You know  Just you know  Just like a quick  Kind of like  Like a sound bite  And it's kind of weird  But throw a couple  Of you know  Bucks in there  Just because

[02:44:30]  For the month of July  Wins a MiFi  And a day in the studio  With the show  So far  The guy from  Was it Boston?  Yeah Boston  Is in the lead  He had wow stickers  On his tits  And he had his shirt  Pulled up  Like he had wings  Is this it?  Oh is this it?  It happened in Springfield  We're looking at the video  Right now  Big  Fucking  Fucking deal  Get rid of this asshole  And here comes the assault  On the media guy  In the cape  Oh being Anthony  The guy has to turn around  On live TV  What is the guy saying? 
[02:45:00]  Holy shit  That guy might be in the lead  We need some sound  That was beautiful  Wait can we see that again?  I know this is radio  Anthony explain this  Oh it's an old guy  It looks like he's at  Some courthouse steps  Yep  Doing his  And he's doing his stand up  Right  And it's a live  Channel 22  Yep  News  And he's just standing  And then from the left  A guy comes with an  Opie and Anthony  XM satellite t-shirt  And a yellow cape  And he's actually  Carrying on a conversation  Oh wow 
[02:45:30]  The news guy stops talking  Turns around and looks at him  And says something  And the guy doesn't  Stop talking for a second  You know what I love  About these assaults  On the media  I think Steve started  They started adding  Their own graphics  Like in this one  It says blah blah blah  Another politician  Wants to steal your money  Blah blah blah  Big fucking deal  All added to the footage  Obviously  Get rid of this asshole  And then boom  There's the assault  On the media  From one of our fans  And he has the good  Opie and Anthony shirt  Which is this Opie and Anthony  And then just XM under it  Which I like  Because the original ones 
[02:46:00]  That they had were nice  But a little too small  That one you can read  Which is perfect  That guy used something like  Final Cut Pro  Or Motion  Or something  He's got some kind of  A graphics program  That he's superimposing  Over the news shot  Which makes it just  Funnier to watch  Yeah  This thing's gonna be  Downloaded a lot  The look on the dude's face  Is absolute glee  And he straightens his shirt  At one point  Like to make sure  Everybody can read it  Like his hands are on his hips  Like a little superhero  He came running him  With his hands on his hips  And then he straightens his shirt out  And he won't shut up  What's the audio?  Do we have audio for that?  We're getting it now  The old reporter just turns around 
[02:46:30]  And he knows he's been had  And he just kind of smiles  Like oh  He's got a bit of a  Master Po look to him  The guy that does this  Yeah definitely  That's right  He probably didn't even realize  He was interfering  Just came over  Gentlemen if you need anything  I'll be happy  I want to hear the audio  But I think this guy  Might have beat out Steve  This is pretty good  For the best one of the month  Let's get some audio on this one  Yeah we'll get the audio  In a little while  What do we got?

[02:47:30]  Doing his own commercial  I think it was a reporter  No reporter with another politician  Doing something stupid  That's Cy Becker  Old Cy Becker from Springfield  Reporting  Another politician  Reporting on another politician  Who wants to steal your money  This is great  It's in a loop  We're just watching it  Over and over again  And he turns around  And starts  He got scared a little  And then he starts laughing  And turns and just looks right at him  And kind of shakes his head  He didn't turn around though  And say  Hey man  What the fuck's your problem  Because there's an idiot  With a cape  Just standing behind him  And the pests 
[02:48:00]  Own this bit  But I just want to say  We're liking the direction  It's going in  Where now it's going to  Costumes and things like that  Absolutely  Because the signs  Were really exciting at first  But quite frankly  That's getting old fast  The costume  And the blurting out  Of OpianAnthony  Is great  Oh that was me  We got the guy on the line  Let's say hi to Tim  In Springfield Mass  Tim what's up  Opie what's going on man  Anthony everybody  Bill Burr  Jim Norton  You got the whole gang today  That happened a couple days ago  What the story was  Was our Springfield

Well one of them was small  So  Oh well good  Good idea  Thank you Steve  That's delicious  Here keep that  All right  Can we get this  Is Paul Prevenza ready to come in? 
[02:53:00]  Oh man  Should we go right to Paul then?  I guess so  Big director  We can't have him waiting around?  No  What about your interviews?  We're opening the Monday through Friday radio program  But Bill you can't leave  I got this big wacky sitcom audition to go to  But I thought we were all just having fun and stuff  What happened?  Obie if I book this and I get to play the next door neighbor  I mean come on  Really?  Every time I enter  You'll have a catchphrase  I got the applause break?  Yeah  What's going to be your catchphrase?  I have no idea 
[02:53:30]  It should be that obnoxious laugh  You could be the end as guy at the end of the credits  You have end Bill Burr as  Oh yeah  Whatever your name is  If you make the end as guy  Because I was watching Good Times  They had a marathon over the weekend  I saw a little bit of that  Did you?  Yeah I was watching some of that  Did you just be checking out Janet Jackson  To see if you could guess how good looking she was going to be in a way?  Yeah she was a fat little kid wasn't she?  She was  And I was watching and noticed that a couple of seasons in the credits changed 
[02:54:00]  And it was and Jimmy Walker as JJ at the end of the credits  So he wound up getting the top billing  Yeah  That's really top billing  Which caused the rift on Good Times  Yes  Is that what started the John Amos Rift?  Yeah because that was supposed to be like  From what I heard it was supposed to be like a family show  That was focused on the parents  Yeah  And then of course  All you need is one catchphrase like say a dynamite  Dynamite  Well if you remember also Happy Days 
[02:54:30]  Arthur Fonzarelli there  Was midway through the credits  When it first started  Was always Tom starring Tom Bosley top billing  But then it turned into  And Henry Winkler  As Fonzie  He was the and as  If you make and as on a sitcom  Your goal  That means it wasn't your show but you took over  Right  It wasn't your show to start with  Did they do that with Urkel?

You thought you were just  Yeah  That's great  Alright, then  We eat on the air  We open up our mail on the air  Can I masturbate on the air?  Absolutely  Anything goes  If you like, sir  Sure  There's a couple guys around here that would check that out  So go ahead  Man  Morning  Getting a lot of publicity  Wacky, eh?  About this movie  You want to hear something funny?  Yes 
[02:59:30]  We were hanging out  While we were shooting this movie  You guys and Penn Jillette and I  Were all hanging out  Remember when we were hanging out backstage at Spinal Tap?  Spinal Tap  We were shooting that night  That's what we were doing  When we went in the other room  Really?  We shot Andrew Ture and Michael McKean for this movie  Get the fuck out of here  Yeah  Well, thanks for  Wow  Thanks for, you know  Putting a camera in our face  And seeing what we could come up with  Who the hell were we?  We were nobodies  We were very soon to be fired radio personalities  That's right  You see, that was before I knew  That you would get people fucking in St. Patrick's Cathedral  If I had known that 
[03:00:00]  Yeah  There'd be a whole movie about you guys  Allegedly  That is  That is  Genuine heroic  Should have been telling that joke in St. Patrick's  That's right  That would have gotten us  Yeah, a lot of publicity  People  And some controversy  But the people seem to be enjoying it  Yeah  Yeah  Have you seen it yet?  No  We want to see it  Well, why weren't you?  We don't get invited to anything  Because Opie was very busy watching that goddamn Penguin movie  You seem to enjoy my description of March of the Penguin 
[03:00:30]  I was smiling to be nice  Well, the penguins are much better dressed than most of the people in the aristocrat  I went and saw March of the Penguins, yes  But this movie sounds like something I would definitely check out  And next time maybe we should be invited  Now, a lot of people didn't know about this whole thing  Really?  With this joke  Yeah, start from the beginning  It's very inside as far as the comics go  Everybody knew it in the comedy industry  But very few people knew about it outside of that  Yeah, it's kind of an inside joke  You know, but not because it's like a secret 
[03:01:00]  Like, I mean  It is a secret handshake  It is a secret handshake  But not in like the Illuminati way  Yeah  Not in like the Masonic ritual way  It's not like going to be hunted down and killed, you know  With rubber chickens or some shit like that  It stayed an inside joke  Because when you get outside people  Outside the, you know, circle of people that get you  You know, you find real quickly that that was a bad idea  You know, you don't tell this joke over the Thanksgiving turkey  No  You know, unless your family's the Manson family  But, yeah, so it just sort of stayed in the world of comedy 
[03:01:30]  And musicians, musicians dig this joke in a big way  Really?  Yeah, you know, they're fucking nuts  Yeah  And so musicians and comedians really know the joke a lot  So it kept it alive  A lot of people are  There's a couple of different origins to this thing  People say it was kind of a way to get the young comics  And kind of make them look stupid for laughing at it  Because it really doesn't have a punchline  I suppose it's possible that that happens  But that wasn't my experience 
[03:02:00]  No  It's not like a non-joke  It's not like No Soap Radio  Or, you know, hey kid, go get the left-handed axe  You know, at the Boy Scout camp  It's not like that  I mean, it's a genuine joke  You know, it's just a real simple switch  It's a, you know, it's not the most hilarious joke in the world  In its basic form  But once you get your hands on it  You know, you can do whatever you want with it  So it actually, I never had the experience of it being a  You know, let's give the new guy some shit  I always had the experience of it being  You know, everybody else being like 
[03:02:30]  Well, I have somebody that's never heard the joke before  Let's go  It's not so much the destination of the joke  As it is the whole journey  Yeah, it's getting through it  That's the whole point  Yeah, the movie is about  The movie is about  It's the journey  And really it's the singer, not the song  You know, because  It's, you know, it's chopsticks  It's Mary Had a Little Lamb  Everybody knows it  You know, it's goofy  It's simple  There's nothing complicated about it  What can you do with it?  You know  And it's really  When you're hanging around a bunch of people  Who love to make each other laugh 
[03:03:00]  And love to also, you know, stroke their own egos  And masturbate comedically  Which, as you know, we fucking love  It can get really, really hilarious  You know  And so this was just a chance to take everybody backstage  I mean, you know  This has been my life since I was like 17  And I've just been surrounded by like  Hilarious, world-class funny people  Who have me in tears all the time  And, you know, people don't get to see that shit  And I understand  Most people don't realize  A lot of these comedians  That are really funny on the stage  Are even funnier behind the scenes 
[03:03:30]  It's astonishing  When they're not worried about restraints  Exactly  And the limits of their comedy  Yeah, yeah  And when we're hanging out with each other  It's no holds barred  And we just have a great time  So this was a way to sort of like  You know, try and share that a little bit  You know  And also examine that whole thing  About improvisation  You know, Penn  When Penn and I came up with this idea  He was really getting into jazz  He's actually like a real jazz guy now  He's like, you know  He plays upright bass  With a bebop piano player  Named Mike Jones  In Vegas  The hour before their show starts 
[03:04:00]  The Penn and Teller show  Starts at the Rio  There's a whole pre-show  Which is a jazz duo  And it's Penn  And he's like  He's like a real jazz guy  He had a little soul patch  For a while  You know  I was like  When are you going to start shooting heroin?  Come on  You're really into this  And so he was getting  Really, really into jazz at the time  And I, you know  I mean, I know jazz  I like jazz  I have kind of a drive-by impression of it  I pretty much got everything I needed to know  And said  Well, it's really hard work to know more  I'm moving on  But he was really into it 
[03:04:30]  And he would be talking about improvisation  And talk about, you know  Structure and how  You know  Why  What's genuine improvisation  And what's just sort of recapitulation  Of ideas you've done before  And what  And how much is craft and technique involved  In it  And all this stuff  And he'd be talking about this  And I'm sitting there going  He's talking about like Mingus  And, you know  Miles Davis  And Coltrane  And I go  He's talking about comedy  Everything he's saying  He's talking about comedy  This is what we do all the time  You know  And so I said to him  I said  You know, it's interesting  Because you hear musicians 
[03:05:00]  Do the same song  Reinterpret it all the time  You know  A million people do  You know  The same song over and over  You hear singers do the same song  You even get to see actors  Play the same part  Different actors play the same part  It plays, you know  You get to see the same cathedral  Somewhere in the south of France  Painted by 20 different artists  You know  But nobody's ever done that with comedy  Because any good comedian  Isn't going to want to do  Professionally what other comedians are doing  So they never do the same  They can do the same topics  Or whatever  But this was a chance  To take, you know  This one stupid little joke 
[03:05:30]  And see what happens  Reinterpreted through all those people  You never think of comedy that way  Because like you said  With musicians doing a remake of a song  Sometimes it's really good  Sometimes it's really bad  And it's the same song  It's just the way they're  Putting it across  You know  The best analogy I can give you  Is my way  You know  Sinatra  Classic, right?  Paul Anka  Wrote the thing  Classic  Sid Vicious  Classic  Three totally different songs  Right, right  You know 
[03:06:00]  Same song  That's what happens in the movie  With this joke  You know  And the fact that it's the filthiest joke  In the world  Makes everybody just go crazy  Yeah  Well that's another thing  There was some  Isn't there controversy  As to what theaters  Are going to be playing this  And what aren't  Because one of the chains  Dropped out  Lowe's I think it was  No it was AMC  It was AMC  We just bought Lowe's  Just bought Lowe's  But the jokes on them  Because we were already in Lowe's  All over the country  So the AMC guys  Oh goddammit  They must be stopped  Now what was their whole  Take on the thing 
[03:06:30]  That they were  Angered by this  Is it rated R?  It's unrated  Unrated  We sent it out  Unrated  Because you know  Penn and I felt  Really strong about  And Think Films  Who were distributing it  They were really cool  Because we told them  Early on  Because they were like  You know  If we send this thing  To the ratings board  We're going to get an NC-17  Yeah  So let's figure out  You know  How to market this thing  And we said  Well why don't we just not  Submit it to the ratings board  It's voluntary  It's not a rule  It's not a law  Even though there are  You know 
[03:07:00]  Caveats that go along with it  Like if you get an NC-17  There are certain theaters  That won't play it  Right  Newspapers that won't  Advertise it  Or whatever  And we're like  Well who the fuck  Are the people  Making these decisions  Do you know any of them?  No  No  Of course not  You ever get a chance  To cast your vote?  Of course not  Who the fuck are these people?  And what are they telling us  What we can see  And can't see  In certain areas  What the fuck is this?  You know  This is America  What is this shit?  So we said  You know what  We're tired of being treated  Like retarded six year olds  We think the audience  Deserves more  We'd like to send it out  Unrated  And think  In a really ballsy move 
[03:07:30]  Because I mean  It's just  It's a risky thing to do  They said  Unrated  And if we had  Submitted  People say  Oh you know  They're sending it out  Unrated  So they get  Some press or whatever  To juice the thing  And I go  Do you have any idea  How much press we would get  To be the first film  That's just talking heads  But it's rated the same  As teenage whip bitches  You don't see one dick  One tit  Exactly  Do you know how much press  We would have gotten for that?  We actually  We actually  You know  Went the other direction  Because we thought  That would be really cynical 
[03:08:00]  Which is really amazing  I'd love to see  I'm sorry man  I'd love to see  What kind of films  That they do show  Did they show  Scarface  AMC  I'd love to make that  They showed Irreversible  Which is like a 20 minute scene  Of violent anal rape  Yeah the French movie  Very very  Wow  Yeah  They showed LIE  Which is kids fingering each other  I mean  Hot is hot  Yeah  You know  Penn actually has  Yeah also  But not as funny  Penn  Always  His attitude on it  He says  You know what it is  The guy at AMC  Is some needle dick loser 
[03:08:30]  Who made a lot of money  Now runs a theater chain  Sees us coming along  Decides to  You know  Get some press for himself  Get a little attention  As the moral arbiter  And all that  And we're supposed to play victim  And go  Ooh hoo  Boo hoo  We're tortured artists  They won't let us  Thank you  They won't let us  You know  Play a movie  And all that sort of shit  And it really is a crock of shit  Because you know what  The big theater chains  Are the ones that are  Fighting every day  For their own survival  Yeah  And methods of distribution  Are popping up 
[03:09:00]  Every ten seconds  There's some new avenue  For people to see shit  Yeah  So it's like  We really didn't care about it  And we also  We didn't want to stoop  To that level  Because we didn't want to  You know  We don't have to answer to him  Right  One guy  And also  We don't  I really don't want to  Stoop to the level  Of like for example  You know  There were rumors  Unsubstantiated  But there are rumors  That we don't feel  Are necessary  You know  To bring up  About the popcorn  Having you know  Been poisoned  We don't know  There are rumors 
[03:09:30]  There are rumors  The CDC  Center for Disease Control  Has been testing it  No proof of evidence  Yeah  All right  It's just a few hundred monkeys  In one test  That's not a random sampling  So we're not going to  Cast these versions  Yeah  This whole Ebola  AMC virus  It's still speculation  You know  We wouldn't go  We wouldn't go down  That road  Because we're classier  Than them  And the FDA  Does allow  A certain amount  Of adult semen  In popcorn  Before they classify  It as unhealthy  So technically  They've done nothing wrong  How do they 
[03:10:00]  In essence  Ban  A movie  That is  Just talking  It's what comedians  Have had to deal with forever  It's just talking  It is words  That are strung together  There aren't any  Graphic images  In this  And by the way  Five Oscar winners  In this movie  Hey there you go  Five Oscar winners  Name some of the  The comedians  That are going to be  In the movie  All right  Who's got the list  Let me see how many  I can remember  I was amazed  That well  There's got to be  At least 60 guys  Well guys and gals here 
[03:10:30]  Maybe even more  There's about a hundred  About a hundred people  Yeah  We can't actually define it  Because we're not sure  If the six people  That are the editorial staff  Of The Onion  Should be counted as one  You know  Or Penn and Teller  You got Jason Alexander  Louis Black  George Carlin  Drew Carey  Tim Conway  Keep going  I want to hear it  I haven't heard it  In a while  Wow  Was Rita Rudner filthy  You got Rita Rudner  To be filthy  No Rita Rudner  Was not filthy  See that's the thing  Is we went to everybody  And we said  You know  Do you want to do this 
[03:11:00]  They were like yeah  And like people like Rita  A handful of people  Actually Jake Johansson  Some of the older  Generation comics  They were like  You know  We don't really want  To do the joke  Or we don't want  To do it filthy  So we were like  Do whatever you want  The whole point is  Right  Your interpretation  Of this one joke  And if your interpretation  Is that you don't want  To do it  Phyllis Diller  Flat out says  She's not going  To do the joke  And her interpretation  Of it actually  Was that that's the set up  And then 80 minutes  Later in the movie  You get the payoff  And it was last night  It went through the roof  Right  Her interpretation  Was being the one 
[03:11:30]  Who you know  Fainted when she heard  The joke  I could have seen  The  And that was it  That's really doing  The joke  I could have seen  The aristocrats  Last night  Dude  And instead  I'm watching  Penguins march  70 miles  If you start  Taking our calls  You'll be getting  Into some of this shit  Who took your call  I don't know  Was it Ben Sparks  Ben Sparks  I've been hearing  About this movie  For three or four months  I would have went  In the second  Last night  Instead the penguins  Are waddling across the ice  I went to the after party 
[03:12:00]  At Caroline's  Because I heard  Carlin might be there  So of course  I wanted to get  A picture signed  But I didn't see that  I don't know if you went  But it was great  Just to see the comics there  And it was jammed  Everybody loved the movie  How do you keep this  How do you keep this interesting  Because the concept is basic  It's one joke  The interpretation  By a hundred guys  And girls  Well it's a little more than that  I mean there's a lot  Of commentary around it  And the movie  Actually turned into  More than just  A look at  You know  It's the singer  And not the song  And just a sort of  Backstage look at  The history of this joke  And all that stuff  It turned into  A lot more than that  Because you know  You get all these people 
[03:12:30]  Talking about  The filthiest joke in the world  Or doing the filthiest joke  In the world  Some interesting shit  Is going to come up  Who is the filthiest comedian  Well you know  It's a tough call  Because it depends  On where your lines are  I've heard Bob Saget  I've heard Gilbert Godfrey  Saget's pretty out there man  We've been hearing that  For years too  Wait you guys  Have ever seen Saget live  And we've seen  Oh Jesus  You guys  I know  He's the filthiest mouth  You've ever heard of your life  I know  And we've seen just about  I've seen just about  Everyone on this list  Over the years  I've never seen him  And that's all I hear  Is that he is so dirty 
[03:13:00]  You can't even imagine  You know  In 1977  Or 76-77  I went to college  It was my freshman year  In college  And I was at the  University of Pennsylvania  In Philadelphia  And I was deep into comedy  Already at this point  And there were no comedy clubs  Yet in Philly  And so I used to go  To all these  I used to go to like dorms  It's a huge place  So like a dorm  Is like you know  An audience is 700  Or something  You know  So I used to go to these dorms  And set up these shows  And I would go and do comedy  And this guy comes up to me 
[03:13:30]  And he goes  I can't believe  You know  You're setting up comedy shows  I'm in a comedy team  A friend of mine  Over at Temple University  It's my friend  Sam Domsky  Saying this  He goes  A friend of mine  Over at Temple University  We got a comedy team  Let's do some shows together  So we started putting shows together  Well that was Saget and Domsky  So I saw Saget  Way back in the mid 70's  From the moment I met this guy  He was the filthiest motherfucker  I have ever seen in my life  Just amazing  Everything out of his mouth  Is hilariously filthy 
[03:14:00]  And you know  He looks like  You know  It's going to be on the show next week  By the way  Oh man  He's so funny  But it's brilliant  I mean it's not  It's not just that he's spewing filth  I mean he's  He's just this amazing craftsman  He's hilarious  He gets on that show  Mr. Wholesome Dad  And that was the joke to us  Right  People that see this movie  Think it's hilarious  That he's talking dirty  We thought it was hilarious  That he was doing that shit  The Wholesome Dad act  Exactly  But you know  He said I'm an actor  I got a job  I played the role  Yeah  It's true  That's so weird  Yeah he is really 
[03:14:30]  You got Don Rickles  I mean the list goes on and on  I love Rickles  He's one of my favorites  Of all time  Was there any definitive start  To this joke  Like were you able to trace it back  To this guy  I'll tell you how far back  We got it  And we can't speculate  We don't like to speculate  More than that  But we got it back  Pretty far  On first hand information  There's a guy in the movie  Named Jay Marshall  And Jay just  He died about a month ago  At the age of 94  Wow  And Jay  You saw him  How old are you guys?  I'm 28  Lion whore 
[03:15:00]  Yeah  37  Okay 37  I know you've seen Jay Marshall  On the Ed Sullivan show  No I didn't watch Sullivan  I was  Unless I saw  Oh no we're  Past your bedtime  Yeah Sullivan  We missed the whole Sullivan thing  Fuck I'm a million  68 I was born  So it was kind of like  Mid 70s  I don't even think  It was in Carson  Jay Marshall was on  The Ed Sullivan show  About 70 times  And he used to do  Like a senior  Wences kind of thing  Like a fucking puppet  Called  Sudai  Sudai  Just kind of like  We're just that hand puppet  Kind of thing  He had a million  He was a magician 
[03:15:30]  He was a juggler  He was a comedian  He was just like  Was he old on Sullivan?  Yes  Isn't that amazing  When you watch a show like that  And he's old on that?  He was a walking showbiz archive  He started in vaudeville  Okay  And he told us  That when he was about  Seven or eight years old  An old guy at that time  Told him the aristocrat's joke  Wow  And the old guy  Told him that he heard it  When he was like  At the same age  That Jay was 
[03:16:00]  When he heard the joke  Wait aren't you getting back  Into like the early 1800s?  We're talking about  Mid to late 19th century  Yeah  So we've traced it back  At least that far  From first hand information  Wow  And it probably goes  Way further than that  You know  I like to think that  You know  The aristocrats  You guys haven't seen the movie  So  No  But you know the joke  Just for your listeners  Yeah  For both of your listeners  It just starts off  With a guy goes into  A talent agency  Which right off the bat  Is sort of an old structure  It kind of  You know 
[03:16:30]  I mean  It goes and he says  I got a great act  And the guy says  What's your act?  He goes  It's my whole family  It's my wife  My kids  Grandparents  Everything  He goes  Sounds great  Tell me about your act  He brings the family in  And they proceed to engage  In every disgusting  Vile  Filthy sex act  Deficulty  I can actually do the joke here  But I won't  Because I've heard too many versions  And mine  The only thing that I can be certain  Is original about mine  Is the phrase  Arcing ropes have come  But I mean 
[03:17:00]  Every family member  Is fucking in  Every configuration  Shit  There's piss  There's vomit  There's live AIDS virus  You fucking name it  Going on  The idea is to just be  As offensive  And rude  And vile  As possible  And then the agent says  What do you call  And act like that  And they go  The aristocrat  And it's just this goofy  Little switch  But so  Wait I started telling you that  For a reason  The joke  I lost track  Yeah  Fell off the track  Why aren't you in it though 
[03:17:30]  I mean you're a great comic  And how come you don't  You don't put yourself in it  Because  I did with this movie  What everybody else did  Was their own interpretation  This movie is my interpretation  You know  The movie is also  Like I started to say before  The movie is also  Like this backstage look  I mean this year  When we shot this thing  We never actually shot a movie  We were just really going  To hang out with friends  You know we used  Mid price range consumer cameras  We never set up a light  We never  The sound was just  You know clip on a mic  And throw the pack off to the side  It was just  We never did anything  Did you go film or video? 
[03:18:00]  Mini DVD  We did sketches  We did line drawings  I mean we  We had no idea  The first night of shooting  I had the camera in one hand  And the manual in the other  And I was turning the pages  Come on really?  Turning the pages with my teeth  Wow  When I tell you  We knew nothing  About what the fuck  We were doing  I'm not exaggerating  For a while  Penn was holding the camera  Sorry go ahead  For a while  Penn was holding the camera  And I said to him  I said you're not  Holding the camera anymore  He goes why  I go because all we have  Is the top of everybody's head  It's all unusable 
[03:18:30]  We were retarded  Seriously  We knew nothing  About what we were doing  We played the version  Of the joke done by Cartman  You ever hear the Eric Cartman  From South Park version  Is it in the movie?  That was done for us  Oh really?  Oh it was?  Okay  Matt and Trey did that  Just for us  That's fantastic  Is it in the movie?  Yeah it's in the movie  We gotta play it though  Again here  Go for it  It's all animated  Obviously not just his voice  No it's the kids  Yeah they animated  The kids waiting for a buzz  My favorite part of this  By the way  That's great  And when you hear the joke  When your listeners  Hear as the joke continues  You have to sort of 
[03:19:00]  Harken back to the beginning  Of it  But the beginning of it  Puts me on the floor  Because he says  Hey guys you wanna hear a joke  My grandpa told me  Here it is  A version of the  Aristocrats joke  Done by Cartman  And the gang  You guys wanna hear  A funny joke  My grandpa told me  No  Okay  So this family  Walks into a talent agency  It's a mother  Father  Their son and daughter  And a little baby  The father says to the talent agent  Sir our family has an amazing act  We know if you would let us  Perform it for you  You would want to sign us  And the talent agent says  Sorry we don't sign family acts 
[03:19:30]  They're too cutesy  But then the mother goes  Please sir  If you just give us two minutes  We know you'll like our act  So the talent agent says  Alright you've got two minutes  The family jumps right into it  The mother smiles  And points to the son  Who hits play on a boombox  Thrilling circus music  Starts to play  As the father  Spins his daughter around  Bins her over  Lifts up her skirt  And starts licking her ass home  What?  Then the son lays down on the floor  And opens his mouth  And the mother tears off  Tearaway pants  Squats down over his face  And starts shitting all over him  Dude  Hold down hold down  The father grabs the baby  Takes off his diaper  And starts sucking his cock  Right?  While the son  Still with his mother's shit in his mouth  Goes over and licks the baby's tiny little balls 
[03:20:00]  Dude  Hold down cow  Now the mother lays down on her back on the floor  While the daughter gets up high on a chair  And starts pissing all over  Then the father and son  Take the baby  And start stuffing it  Head first back into the mother's vagina  While the daughter's piss  Rains down on all of them  Dude just stop  They get the  Hold down cow  They get the baby halfway in  So that just his legs are sticking out  All kicking and flailing around  The son takes the mother's shit out of his mouth  And starts rubbing it all over everyone  While the father  Sticks his cock in the baby's asshole  And fucks it  While it's still inside the mother  Until he comes all over the baby  The wife and the son  And the daughter  Cartman I don't want to  Cock  Will you hold on 
[03:20:30]  Please  Then the father gets up and says  And now for impersonation  Of the victims of 9-11  And the whole family starts  Running around the room  Screaming and laughing  With their dicks and titties  All slapping around  Covered with shit and piss and cum  Going  Ah!  Ah!  The baby's coming down!  Help!  And finally the family runs back  To the center of the room  And goes  Ta-da!  And the talent agent  He just sits there  For the longest time  And finally he says  Jesus that's a hell of an act  What do you call it?  And the father says  The aristocrats  He he he  I don't get it 
[03:21:00]  Neither do I  There you have it  I'm going to tell you  This is not even in the top five  Of filthiest versions  Really?  Come on  I'm serious  I'm not kidding  It's unbelievable  And it really is like  Even people that I think  Would be turned off  By the vulgarity  And all that stuff  Have come up to us  After screenings  And just go  It's like a breath of fresh air  It's like first of all  You're stunned into submission  Right  And then all of a sudden  It becomes like liberating  You know  It's weird  I mean the response 
[03:21:30]  Is just tremendous  And I love that  People all have a different  Experience when they see the movie  Some people love  One person's rendition  And the person they're with  Like that's their least favorite  And it's just  It's just so cool  You know  It's really fun  And then there are people  That just would not  Even find anybody  Telling it remotely entertaining  Right  Just purely offended  By what is being said  Which and before  You know the buzz got out  About the movie  And how really  You know  Obscene  The language is 
[03:22:00]  There were people  Showing up at screenings  And just like  Well I want to see  What this is about  You know  And so many people  At those like  Early festival screenings  You know  So many of those people  Like part of what was  So much fun  Was seeing who was  Walking out  And when  Like you could actually  Track  You could actually  Chart certain waves  Of when you've crossed  Lines for certain people  Right  Like six minutes in  Carlin does his version  And it's really filthy  And it's really  It's really gross  And it's genius  By the way  I mean  You know 
[03:22:30]  All the accolades  That we always give him  All the props we give him  He deserves it  And this thing  It's just like  He's a master at work  You know  Rolling around in the mud  And it's really funny  Six minutes in  Boom  People get up  And they walk out  And then a little bit  Further in  People start talking  About cunts  And boom  There's another way  And then a little further  There's these places  Where you just know  You just know  Like okay  Next shift  You know you're losing  So right  It was so funny  But now  We've also been really clear  About the language  In fact in all advertising  We always say  No nudity  No violence  But unspeakable obscenity 
[03:23:00]  You know  And all the  We purposely put  Review quotes  In everything  That talks about  You know  Like there's one  That says it all  That's at the top  Of the ads  On the cab tops  Which makes me howl  That says you know  It's obscene  It's disgusting  It's filthy  It's vile  And it's the funniest movie  You'll ever see  That's great  So we do that all the time  We keep putting  Everything  We keep putting out  About how the language  Is filthy  And if you've ever been  Offended by any word  You know  This is not your cup of tea  You know  Because we're going  To hit them all 
[03:23:30]  And now  You know  We're not getting  So many people  Who are unprepared for it  But we're not trying  To sucker punch anybody  You know  We're not trying  To trick anybody  We don't want  Anybody in there  Who's not going  To enjoy themselves  No there's no need to  Yeah  Yeah  This is not for you  It's like  You know  We try and explain  To everybody  Look  We're going to take you  In the back room  With the big boys  Okay  It's going to get  A little rough  If you want to come  And hang out  You're welcome to  But it's going to get  A little rough  If you can handle it  Exactly 
[03:24:00]  We're not trying  To trick anybody  You don't want people  To be confused  And think they're going  To see a Disney's Aristocats  I've got to tell you  Really  Someplace in Florida  No  There was a  Preview screening  And the minimum wage  High school kids  On break  That were working  At the theater  Apparently didn't pay  Attention at the meeting  And this family  Came up  With these two kids  In tow  And they really  Believed that they  Were going to see  The Disney Aristocats  Okay 
[03:24:30]  But here's the best part  It was 20 minutes  Before they left  I guess they kept  Waiting  Well I guess  After all the fucking  And sucking  I guess the cats  Start dancing  That is funny  Whereas we are  Siamese if you please  This ain't it  How do you really  Know that  But see  That's the thing  Since it's not out there  Unrated  I mean since it's  Out there unrated  We're taking extra 
[03:25:00]  Care of letting  Everybody know  What's in there  Because you know  If a movie comes out  Right  If it's got an R  Or a G  Or a PG-17  What does that mean exactly  We don't really know  You know  No it is kind of a vague thing  Yeah  And if you're a big studio  With a lot of money  A G is the same as an R  For you know  Guys like us  Who are just making  A little movie  It's all so fucking arbitrary  And so political  And so money driven  Right  So you really get  Absolutely no information  Because we're not rated  We are giving you  Way more information  Than they would have  Ever given you  You know  We're telling you 
[03:25:30]  Right up front  Exactly what to expect  Yeah  Hey  Are you online  Is anybody online  Yes  Yeah  Go to Radar  Magazine dot com  Or do a Google search  For Radar Magazine  They did an article  Called The Aristocrats  Blow by Blow  Where in alphabetical order  They describe everything  That happens  Really  In people's versions of jokes  And it's one of the funniest  Things I've ever seen  Seeing it all laid out  Like that  In like encyclopedia form  It makes me weep  It's so funny  Radar Magazine dot com  I think it's  Radar Magazine dot com  And when's the movie  Come out by the way 
[03:26:00]  Friday  Friday  Can I see it today  There is a screening  Tonight isn't there  Or today  Is there a press screening  Please  They're whispering  Make a call  I think there is a screening  Today  I think there's a screening  This afternoon actually  I'll plug the hell out of it  Tomorrow I promise  Are you Catholic  I'm sorry you can't come  Like I said  I would have rather seen  Your movie last night  Than The March of the Penguins  AMC  That really really irritates me  No surprise though  But it's such a statement  About how  It's language 
[03:26:30]  Exactly  This is how fucking awful  People are about spoken word  It's disgusting  And what's really funny  Is not only is it just language  But you know  This movie  It's just talking heads  You're right  It is just all language  But there's also no conflict  Or hostility  In this way  Everybody's having the time  Of their lives  Right  A good time  And there's some  Saucy language  But who cares  It gets a bit naughty  They're a little racy  But meanwhile  PG-13 movie  You could go in there  And how big is the body count  You know  Violence 
[03:27:00]  People dying  How about War of the Worlds  What was that fucking  Burlesque parody  Of 9-11  And that's  That's okay  What the hell is that  Yeah  Come on  It's just something about  The  Come on  It's something about  People in this country  Being offended by things  That  Fun  Humor  That offends them  More than death  And destruction  It's just  They would rather  Their kids  See  Horrible images  On the news  To teach them  What's going on  Right  Than see people  Than seeing people laughing 
[03:27:30]  Over the word cunt  Or a joke about  You know  Bodily functions  I will never  Ever understand  How do you  How do you feel  About 9-11 humor  Because I was reading  Something about  Gilbert Godfrey  Was I think  Either doing this joke  And he  It's in the movie  Oh it's in the movie  And he edits  Some 9-11 stuff  And people  I guess one guy  Yelled out  Too soon  Too soon  It was three weeks later  Three weeks later  Yeah  You know  I personally  You know  I've met  I've met people 
[03:28:00]  I've met like  You know  Like  You know  They might have been musicians  But I've met people  Who've come up  And said  You know  I really  Like none of this  Was offensive to me  You know  And I was like  Well good on you brother  None of it's offensive  To me either  I'm not offended  By anything in this movie  And this movie  Doesn't even come close  To crossing my lines  I haven't figured out  What they are yet  Yeah  Because as far as  Language goes  I have no lines  I guess  There's no line  As far as language goes  And I said  More power to you  Then you can sit back  And not have to deal  With that aspect of this  And just enjoy the comedy  And he said  Well that's exactly 
[03:28:30]  What happened  He goes  I actually thought  That I would really  Get upset about something  And instead  I just enjoyed myself  You know  But so I have no lines  So the 9-11 thing  You know  It's fine by me  I mean I was getting busted  When I was doing stuff about it  And it was far later  Than Gilbert was doing it  But  Gilbert's thing  That was interesting  Was he was doing it  At a fryer's roast  Right  I can't go  I can't go  We'll give you $8.50  Why can't  Opie why can't you go 
[03:29:00]  They're booked  Oh no no no  There is one  There's one today  Or tomorrow  No  She's telling you  No there's not  Oh there's not  Oh there's not even a screening  Oh I thought  It was sold out or something  Which means there is  But you can't come  I can wait till Friday  No I can wait till Friday then  I don't want you guys  To go out of your way  I'll go Friday  First thing  Like right after the show  Look how  I really wanted to go  Look at the disappointment  No if there was a screening  I would go tonight 
[03:29:30]  But don't set up that stuff  I'll see you Friday  Go ahead Paul  You were saying  I forgot what I was saying  Is this the radar thing  Yeah yeah yeah  Check it out  Here's my favorite  Here's my favorite  It goes alphabetically  Right  Alright let me start  For your listeners  So that  Yeah right off the bat  So that they can see  The format here  Anus  Cow penetrated  By unidentified person's fist  Daughters penetrated  By father's fist  Daughters penetrated  By grandfather  Dog's finger inserted  Into by grandfather  Dog's finger inserted  Into by daughter  Et cetera et cetera et cetera

[03:30:30]  To copulate with daughter  I'm guessing that's Otto  Yeah good guess  Good guess  That's right Otto's in the movie  Right  Boyle popped by father  On own back  Birth canal  Mother's infant son  Half inserted into by father  Buddhist monk  Raped orally  And anally  By indigenous tribesmen  Then killed  And then you got stuff  Like be a clown  Sung by family  In unison  This article is genius  This makes me laugh  Harder than the movie  Are they trashing you  Or they actually love it  Oh they loved it

[03:35:00]  Do you still do stand-up, man?  Yeah  You do?  Because I haven't seen you  Well, guys, I've been working mostly outside the country  For the last five years  I've been all around the world doing stand-up  I just came back from another gig  It's like my fourth gig in Dubai  And Qatar  And Kuwait  Really?  Not for troops?  No, not for troops  For English-speaking expats  There's this  I've been working a lot over in the UK  Where they have a really rich and vibrant comedy scene  And I wish I had gotten into it a little earlier  You know, before we were deep into this movie  Because I would have had a lot of those guys in  Because, you know, those guys can say cunt  They say cunt on stage 
[03:35:30]  Yeah, they say that  Like the squeaky clean guys will say  How you doing, you cunt?  You know, they'll say like  Get this cunt of drink  Like, you know  It's nothing over there  Nothing, nothing  And so when they cut loose  They really cut loose  Yeah  But out of the UK  They book all of these circuits  To bring live stand-up  To English-speaking expat audiences  All around the world  And, you know, they're like  They're lawyers, they're doctors  They're teachers  They're construction firm guys  They're middle management  For like TGI Fridays 
[03:36:00]  And Taco Bell  Which are everywhere  You know  They're liquor distributors  You know, which  You know, most of these countries are dry  But there's liquor distributors there  You know  You get any Kuwaitis in Kuwait  That come in though  Or is it just all  They're actually not allowed to  They're actually not allowed to  But, you know, when you spend some time over there  You realize what a crock of shit all this is  They're such hypocrites  Everybody over there  You know, they're dry countries  They're Muslim  They're fundamentalist countries  You know  And there's all these rules about  You know, you can't talk about Islam on stage  And all that sort of stuff  And it's supposed to be 
[03:36:30]  You know, buy the book  The Koran  They're running  You know, they're running things  In a theocratic state  Yet  The sheiks are bringing in  By the, you know  Boatloadful Russian whores  You know  The guys  They take off their dish dashes  And then they show up  In the western bar  It's supposed to be just for westerners  You know  And they show up  And they're, you know  Picking up Russian hookers  Right and left  It's like  You know  If you get caught with drugs  You know  You're in Midnight Express  For the rest of your life  You know  If you're lucky 
[03:37:00]  And yet  You know  They're  One of the major  Transport centers  For, you know  Opiates around the world  It's such a bunch  Of hypocritical bullshit  I heard Dubai is actually nice  I've never been there  But I heard that  That's more like  A western place  In the Middle East  Right  Which is business  And not as much  Fundamentalism  Exactly  But  That's for us  See they've realized  The United Arab Emirates  Which is  Dubai is in  The UAE  The United Arab Emirates  Has realized  Like a number of countries  Over there  That their 
[03:37:30]  Future  And their financial successes  Involves  The west  It involves the money  And the investment  And it involves  Relationships  And business  Transactions  With the west  So they have  Sort of  Developed  This dual  World  Where  If you're  A native  You're not supposed  To participate  In any of the stuff  That's okay  For westerners  You know  So there's this  Whole world  Of bars  And nightclubs  And all this  Sort of stuff  For westerners  But you see  Those people  In it all the time  The upper echelon  Get to enjoy  Not even upper echelons  There's anybody  Who wants it 
[03:38:00]  You know  They just dress  In civvies  They take off  The traditional garb  They dress in civvies  And they just go  Really just the average  Joe from that area  Some of them  Yeah  Some of them  I hated  That would seem risky  I hated the Kuwait  We went to Iraq  But there was nothing  I'm sorry  It's going to stop you  There's nothing funnier  Than seeing a guy  In a dish dash  At a urinal  It's really funny  To see them  Holding their skirts up  And pissing  Sorry  Racist  Fuck me  It's fucking funny  It's 2005  For god's sake  It's 2005  You primitive  The whole world  Is on the brink 
[03:38:30]  Of destruction  Because my imaginary  Friend can beat up  Your imaginary friend  Fucking nutcases  All of them  What do you say  About Kuwait  Just that they  I hated the Kuwaitis  So much  Because we went to Iraq  And we had to stop over there  And get our passport stamped  And then fly  On a military plane  And they are  Because it's all like  They're given like  What a hundred thousand dollars  A year or something  Just for being born there  They're given money  Because they're so oil rich  So they're not used to work  So they took three or four hours  To stamp eight passports  It's amazing 
[03:39:00]  The next day we went  For going through  Wow  Dude  In Kuwait  I came back  I came back from the UAE  On the day of the London bombings  Right  And I happened to be in London  I had to change planes  And spend a night in London  So I was in Dubai  For three days  Right  And I was in London  Overnight  And I show up  I'm in the air  When the bombings are happening  I show up at the airport  With a passport  Stamped from the Middle East  The day before  Going to London  They hassled me
