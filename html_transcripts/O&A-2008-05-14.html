<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts defiantly boasting about their controversial style and disregard for broadcasting standards.  They launched into "Whip Him Out Wednesday," a recurring segment with suggestive themes, comparing it to a similar, unsuccessful attempt by another radio personality.  The hosts then complained about their commutes, particularly Opie's lengthy drive and his dislike of public transportation.  Discussion shifted to listener-submitted "WOW" stickers, leading to reflections on the show's longevity and the evolving audience.  The upcoming "Sex and the City" movie became a topic, with the hosts criticizing the actresses' ages and appearances.

A caller, Mike from Boston, inquired about former personality John Ostland ("Ozone"), prompting the hosts to claim (based on a source named Scorch) that Ozone had undergone a sex change operation.  The political landscape, specifically Hillary Clinton's recent West Virginia primary win and the upcoming Vice Presidential candidate selection, was briefly touched upon, interspersed with a humorous, albeit inaccurate, anecdote about Buffalo Bills quarterback Frank Reich.

Next, the show covered news anchor Sue Simmons' on-air profanity, playing audio of the incident and discussing the ensuing media coverage and rumors about her drinking habits.  This segued into clips of other on-air news anchor mishaps, including a fight and a weatherman's technical jargon leading to a confrontation.  A clip of a weatherman reacting to a cockroach was also shown.

Comedian Robert Kelly made a brief studio appearance to promote his show.  The hosts continued their rambling discussions, encompassing robots in orchestras, the future of sex technology, and their experiences with early internet pornography.  Further commentary on the "Sex and the City" movie and a band's song concluded this segment.  The show consistently featured profanity, sexually suggestive humor, and derogatory remarks.


A substantial portion of the broadcast focused intensely on the "Sex and the City" movie.  The hosts and callers dissected the trailer, criticizing the music and Sarah Jessica Parker's appearance.  Rolling Stone's review was discussed, along with the actresses' ages and perceived sex appeal, and the show's portrayal of women's lives.  Tangents included a planned fart-based radio promotion ("gas for gas"), "The Hills" (revealed by a caller to be scripted), and celebrity gossip involving Sarah Jessica Parker, Madonna, and the "Sex and the City" cast.  Clips from the trailer were played, alongside a reenactment of a scene by studio personnel.  Discussions ranged from the physical appearance of various celebrities (including a supposed Kristen Davis sex tape) to the hosts' musical preferences during sex, a listener's sock-and-blouse laundry mishap, and a comparison between on-screen deaths and the outrage over Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction.  The anniversary of Frank Sinatra's death and the "Seinfeld" finale were also mentioned.  The segment included news clips of on-air gaffes and speculation about a cruise ship passenger falling overboard.  Robert Kelly, Judah Freelander (promoting his Caroline's shows), and other guests were in studio, with discussion also touching upon Alec Baldwin's generosity.  A posthumous Albert Einstein quote about God and Jews was read.


A news story about Sheila Jones' delayed 911 response after a break-in provided a starting point for another segment.  Audio of her calls was played, highlighting the dispatcher's perceived lack of care.  The 2008 presidential election and general distrust of politicians (as voiced by studio guest Judah Friedlander) were discussed.  The hosts then addressed a bar owner selling a racist t-shirt depicting a cartoon monkey eating a banana with the caption “Obama in 08,” playing audio of protesters.  The bar owner's denial of the shirt's offensiveness and callers’ opinions were included.  A lengthy segment followed focusing on "Friendly Bob," a colleague who excessively engaged in elevator conversations, leading to a discussion about awkward elevator interactions.  The segment concluded with a series of extremely vulgar songs ("What What in the Butt," "Shit Dick," and "All Over Your Face"), with audio clips and further discussions of Friendly Bob, the presidential election, Jim Norton's tuna-can-opening struggles, and other tangents.  Judah Freelander left the studio during this segment.


A segment featured studio guest Stephen S. from Bayshore, whose self-made radio promos for ONARadio.com were played and mocked extensively.  The hosts and Jim Norton engaged in crude humor, discussing raw tuna, sexual acts, bodily functions, and Stephen S.'s "awful" promos (including Nazi-themed imagery).  The conversation included a listener's hospitalized brother, pool filter systems (compared to semen), the band Anal Cunt, and a graphic description of a Heather Graham sex scene.  The segment was punctuated by song requests, audio clips (including one of Curtis Sliwa criticizing the show), and listener calls (including a pool professional declining self-promotion).  Further discussions of graphic sexual topics and a listener's story about childhood sexual abuse concluded this segment. A lengthy discussion about a century-old lightbulb involved a caller, "Ted the light bulb expert," who contributed in a rambling manner.  Highly offensive language and sexually explicit dialogue were prevalent.


The final segment featured Patrice O'Neal and Mike DiStefano discussing an upcoming Red Bank show, noting Rich Voss' absence.  This quickly devolved into a comedic bit about a fictional rivalry between a light bulb salesman ("Ted," seemingly one of the hosts) and those who "sell" darkness, incorporating antisemitic tropes.  Caller Steven S. from Bayshore contributed to the absurdist humor.  The segment concluded with vulgar jokes and banter, referencing "Whip'Em Out Wednesday." The tone remained highly vulgar and irreverent.

[00:14:30]  speech i guess yeah basically she was wasting everyone's time knowing the whole nation is tuned  into her so she did like a five minute commercial for her campaign yeah and she knew uh she was gonna  win uh what north carolina west virginia oh west virginia uh they're all the same to me those states  west virginia you know down there it's those states i don't know what she's doing i don't i don't get  genie i don't get it she's uh she's gonna she's a publicity whore she's an attention whore you think 
[00:15:00]  the democrats wants they want this because they're getting a lot of attention every day  uh or is it bad attention but i think they she also was complimenting obama way too much yesterday  and i'm starting to think oh boy and obama's not uh picking on her he's going after mccain now  i think i think it's going to be an obama uh clinton ticket please do that i really i really  and you know something though it would be so typical of the democrats to just self-destruct and  do something goofy like that yeah but they don't have a choice who else do they have 
[00:15:30]  and everyone else went away pick a relative but see the unknown white guy john edwards one of those  guys could run but they should have kept them in the spotlight like they're so stupid as a party  like you still need someone as a vice you know vice president somehow you keep these guys in the  spotlight infighting there's there's so much infighting that's like saying you know uh radio guys we  ought to just get along and kind of promote each other it doesn't happen all right good point good 
[00:16:00]  point good point you know mccain announced his vp yet or no uh no no maybe it's maybe you don't do  that i don't yeah they wait all right maybe it's too soon yeah but uh if if they're gearing up to get  hillary on board as a vice presidential candidate wow that is the biggest mistake they can make yep  it will just be no one's gonna go for that ticket get an alien on board as the secretary of defense  what you know and i don't mean the illegal i mean the space kind thank you it's uh it would be an 
[00:16:30]  instant win for mccain yeah the country is barely barely accepting uh the thought of a black guy or a  woman as president um but now they're gonna do it i don't think they're gonna be able to hit us up  with both of those you need a you need a comfortable vice president that uh white white men want to  vote for yeah or at least like could uh you know go hey i like that guy the west virginia i'm gonna give  this thing a shot the west virginia thing kind of proved that there are still a lot of people in this 
[00:17:00]  country that are willing to take race and uh and vote whitey yeah that uh and and it's been proven  that uh black people vote for obama just based on skin color so uh it still happens you want to hear  some highlights from hillary's thing last night um i bet you can't find one under the rules of our  party when you include all 50 states the number of delegates needed to win is 2209 and neither of us 
[00:17:30]  has reached that threshold yet this win in west virginia will help me move even closer  isn't that like a blowout in a a football game or something let's say and you have like two minutes  left but you're down like four touchdowns and you go hey it's not over until uh the you know  till time's up and uh great analogy still in it great analogy but but why don't you look up uh 
[00:18:00]  somebody named uh frank reich and what he did back in the day for the buffalo bills was  that's a great analogy but why don't you look that what happened i'm not familiar with that  why don't you look that up with the buffalo bills mr kelly the starting quarterback uh well you know  frank reich comes in gets the job done four touchdowns at the two minute i think it was like  six or seven it was no way some people say the greatest comeback in nfl history really frank reich frank 
[00:18:30]  reich look him up no i do frank reich for the buffalo i just figured you'd like his last name  well his last name is catchy i do know who he is oh my god was he frank the third hold on hold on  hold on i want i want buffalo to be able to laugh at eroc today oh eroc just spelled frank reich  r-i-k-e oh boy all of buffalo's laughing at you right now we're finally going local for buffalo  and what are you doing to them r-i-k-e r-i-k-e jesus i've got another k 
[00:19:00]  i know you don't know football but you don't have to know that reich would be an e-i-c-h am i  right have you ever seen the last name r-i-k-e i didn't know the guy i didn't know the guy  he's got to know everybody that he spells their name he's got to know back in football history and  you don't know the guy i didn't know that either but i wasn't gonna uh all right k e  that's our e-rock that's our little e-rock not a good speller no all right here we go uh well 
[00:19:30]  e-rock you had it but you're come on no what year was that you had it stay right was it oldie time  leather helmet years uh no no reich's defining moment in his pro career is actually another comeback  this one often called the greatest comeback in nfl history it's written right there wikipedia  well we all know that can't be wrong it is the greatest comeback in terms of deficit overcome  32 points 32 points in the playoffs my friends following the 1992 season against the houston oilers 
[00:20:00]  uh reich led the bills on a 35 to 3 run in the second half all right second half you only had half a  game to do i said two minutes second half in two minutes big difference five touchdowns in the  second half to come back okay and they had to feed the oilers some say greatest comeback ever so there  you go hillary maybe maybe somehow has a she got a shot has a frank reich in her i'm gonna call it

[00:27:00]  post yesterday simmons the post loves talking to former co-workers yeah that have bad stuff to say  about you yeah that's that's real smart to do see how that works out for you in the end uh simmons  delivered a jaw-dropping f-bomb monday night as she read a teaser for her 11 p.m newscast prompting  an on-air apology from the veteran anchor a half hour later the incident didn't stun some former  colleagues uh sue simmons likes the sauce and she could be cranky about it a former nbc employee  cranky give me my sauce so basically that means if she doesn't get her boo she's gonna raise holy 
[00:27:30]  hell yeah where's my liquor pulls out one of those little what do they call those things  beaker yeah a little uh little flask that's it a little flask she's flat back pocket uh and she  gets cranky about it a former nbc employee told the post she was sometimes a little tipsy on the  air to the point where colleagues would take notice oh boy that's nice tonight yeah well  uh simmons and then they do the old tip tip a little glass in front of your mouth thing yeah 
[00:28:00]  the imaginary tipping thing see sue tonight boozy suzy yeah boozy suzy a little liquid lunch yeah  boozy suzy simmons anchors uh channel force 5 p.m newscast and then has time to pass on uh till 11  p.m so she's got like what five six hours here yeah those hours are regularly spent at midtown  watering holes like gallagher steakhouse and john john george's she'll never go there again i wouldn't 
[00:28:30]  say she gets sloshed sloshed that wouldn't be the right word uh an employee at one of these  restaurants said gesturing to the back booths where simmons typically takes her between show breaks  i would say she gets happy she gets very happy yeah she's been here and she's had drinks with her  dinner uh uh john employee said she's had a cocktail or two yes between shows with dinner she's been known  to make funny faces feigned sleep double over and laughter and poke fun at straight lace co-anchor  chuck scarborough she's feigned sleep i've done that on the air uh that wasn't feigning sleep oh that 
[00:29:00]  was actually sleeping on the air oh fall asleep okay that's what i meant feigning means that you  kind of fake it how do they know she's feigning you didn't fake sleep you i can say i was faking  there's a bit to the point where we all left the studio and kept the mics on yeah for a very long  time before there she is she feigns sleep like kenny sleeps on a plane yeah no that's when she fell  over she also falls out of chairs what is she doing she like fell out of her chair i forgot what 
[00:29:30]  that was all about but it's on youtube if you want to check it out ryan williams did a report that  apparently was boring right oh god he is a potato-headed idiot so it's kind of funny that she  sat through it then just feigned that she fell asleep and fell off her chair oh okay yeah she didn't  yeah she knew she was gonna like do a bit and fall out of her chair see this is what she's always been  about though yeah and i guess she's back on uh the news and that's good you know she made a  mistake let's all relax move on enjoy the youtube video and we'll go on to the next dump thing 
[00:30:00]  act like she's peter finch in network yeah uh and our uh arthur chien has been coming up the last  couple of days because of sue simmons yep he dropped the f-bomb too it's making a bunch of uh  articles the last couple of days with no reference to the opian anthony show and no reference to our  own than who was the one on site uh kind of doing a a uh assault on the media arthur chien was uh 
[00:30:30]  broadcasting from what the top of the stairs of a subway entrance and uh these guys were harassing  him not really they were just holding up signs and saying how we rule and stuff yeah he could have  lightened up about it and right after his report he didn't even wait a uh a second yeah to go to the  tape like it was one of those live stand-up spots that he was introing a tape segment yeah and he  didn't even wait for the tape to start yeah he just turned around and uh so what the f is your  problem man or you know he won his case with the that's your effing problem he won his case with the 
[00:31:00]  station by the way did he mean they basically they decided that he should not have been fired for this  because he was fired yeah he got some compensation and he's now working for another station here in  new york that never made the papers no he was really mad that he got fired for this and it  turned out that uh he should have been reprimanded but not fired that's what they decided you know  what when your job is just to repeat and you drop an f-bomb live i don't know why not they'd fire us 
[00:31:30]  yeah see until we can do it and not be fired i don't care who gets fired but as far as broadcasters  go we're scums well with that i mean that's this that's kind of an element of truth in that but  with the uh with the with the leeway they get for content the news i shouldn't come an additional  responsibility yeah i mean they talk about the responsibility this dumb show uh to behave a  certain way so yeah let him get fired who cares boo we're gonna put this boo we're gonna put this  video of arthur chien up on onaradio.com in a little bit but uh here's how it went down 
[00:32:00]  three years ago by the way anthony three years ago yeah good morning sean this is apparently a  very simple crime to commit all one has to do is buy a couple of multiple by multiple metro cards  stand at the turnstile and just continuously swipe people in all day police sources say these  guys net a couple hundred dollars a day and that's pure profit but it's costing the ta a great  deal about 16 million dollars a year and they're trying to put a stop to it what the problem man 
[00:32:30]  trying to put a stop to it what the yeah he was none too happy with that huh so uh getting a little  attention today yeah for the arthur chien thing back in the day and saucy sue simmons uh keeps her job  uh boozy suzy boozy suzy i like saucy sue at least though they're kind of kind of mellowing out a little  i'm seeing the very beginnings of it yeah where maybe you know in another 10 years 
[00:33:00]  the pendulum will have swung back i'll believe it when we're allowed to make fun of the asians again  uh and i say that because we make fun of everybody so why yeah why do we uh have to exclude the asians  you can't have any kind of jokes yeah that's when i'll know that we're back to normal it's whatever  group has the best email system like whatever you can email the most advertisers and get their  you know that's that's the ones that get the most attention that's not out of respect but the squeaky  wheel right what i don't know yeah i figured i'd blurt that out why because your wheel's squeaking 
[00:33:30]  on your chair oh get some grease oh everyone's trying to find their boo everyone's trying to find  their angle on the on the boozy suzy thing yeah we decided to go with uh when anchors fight  oh yeah we uh we picked out uh three of our favorites one that we captured yeah no one else  had it we just happened to be rolling tape in the uh in the office one day saw it happening live and  just started laughing our asses off we captured here in uh new york steve bartelstein and bill evans 
[00:34:00]  going at it it's one it's one of our favorites by the way whenever anchors have a natural human moment  it's so bizarre because they're robots are robots and it only proves how robotic and unhuman they are  when they do have those moments that you freak out so much because uh you just don't see it yeah  well the first one um this goes back a few years k a b c in la anchors uh fight just before going on 
[00:34:30]  the air nice this one is great and talking might be a little saucy too this one also might be uh having  some drink in between yes first segment it's done that way all the time it frequently is it frequently  well then we better talk about it complaining about it then we better tonight i'm complaining  because tonight we better talk about it because i think you've got a problem i think we've got a  problem all right if that's what you think and we'll talk about it after the show and we'll talk  about it with roger bell because i'm not going to sit here night after night and put up with this 
[00:35:00]  okay night after night night after night well where it looks to me like that's the way it's  going to go i'll take the ante up a little higher than that even you're not only wrong you're way out  of line let me tell you something you started it pal you want herald green you might get him  fine with me fine with me good old carol green okay okay you want to start dealing with go ahead  that's what you want you just might get it 
[00:35:30]  you know you go home and have a couple of shooters and i don't know what the happens but when you come  back you're not the same lady that's not some nights it is ann when news happens you see it happen  on channel seven the number one station for news and information in southern california  now paul moyer and mark johnny mountain weather and todd donahoe sports this is eyewitness news 
[00:36:00]  tonight three men dead tonight in an execution style murder right into it right into the robot mode  what a professional how great is that how uncomfortable must they have been just sitting  there when you go home and have a few you have a few shooters shooters right she's just there  having a few shooters at the house all i see is dean wormer's wife that's what i picture again  just the old broad having a few shooters get me a goddamn drink the ultimate cougar though 
[00:36:30]  yeah i never liked dean wormer's wife really she scared me when that movie first came out  when animal house when i was growing up uh i was thinking yeah that would be all right no absolutely  yeah no i was more i would have rather had the other one that was stuffed the one he got from  the grocery store i know pinto of course duh but uh no dean wormer's wife is scary she had those  pointy boobs you think she was wearing a big girdle you think she was the first official cougar 
[00:37:00]  mrs robinson might have been the first yeah sure you gotta give her that you might have to go with  mrs robinson invented the cougar phenomenon let's go cougar hunting let's not uh going on moving on to  the next anchors when anchors go bad okay mrs robinson watch that movie it's the most overuse of a song  you're ever going to hear oh yeah all right we know every two seconds every like they bang and then  dustin hoppin's walking all right and they have every version of the song every they got this sad 
[00:37:30]  version and when his car's running out of gas the song kind of runs out of steam too  they must have just had enough money to get the rights to that song and that was it yeah because  it wasn't written for the movie i think they just know they just uh thought it would work very well  with the movie and it had to be written for the movie it's called mrs robinson yeah i know it's just  a coincidence oh yeah it's not exactly a you know that's what i heard anyway i heard joe dimaggio 
[00:38:00]  changed his name for the song cnn uh weatherman uh fights with the anchor this is really good  uh to set this one up uh this this weatherman douche is getting way too technical with his  weather jargon oh god and i think the anchor finally was like what are you talking about  do we need an umbrella or not i think this is during katrina wasn't it i don't know but he was 
[00:38:30]  just getting way too technical about barometric pressure all that she had it and he wanted to  get it because it was his that's what it is it was his big day because it was a big weather story  right and uh it was his big day so he figured he he had the run of the joint and she shut him down  and he got a little a little angry yeah well it shows you how like the media how how happy they are  to have their own moments like and how it's not about what's going on it's about their own moment  yeah oh hell yeah way to reiterate jim we're gonna be doing a little trivia really uh fast  here matt in boston this is true listening on bcn lots of calls coming in from uh boston what's up 
[00:39:00]  matt there's a girl that pinto picked up at the supermarket did the famous line in caddy shack  well thanks for nothing so of course same girl that's the same girl you're right yeah very nice  she was better in animal house oh my god a robot conducting an orchestra  that's it we're officially in the future wow someday robots will conduct orchestras  look at this thing yes it's the future we're officially in the future 
[00:39:30]  look at the robot conducting an orchestra an orchestra full of white people  what else will the uh future bring us with robots sir robotic sex yeah that's what we were  promised in the future wouldn't that be nice get a handy from a robot that's when everyone's going  to start paying attention to robots when they figure out how to have sex with them because 
[00:40:00]  exactly every i read a really good article back in the day every new invention they use it for sex  first first and then they figure out other ways to use it even the printing press the printing press  it was a known fact that it was all about pornography when they when they invented the printing press yep  i mean the computers we don't have to tell you about that one the first uh the first time i was able  to hop online and get that first picture that scrolled down like a like a shade a window shade  took a while yeah and you're just waiting and going this is the best invention ever 
[00:40:30]  it took me 20 minutes on my parents gateway to download let's just say it was a video  probably a 30 second clip of a girl in the restroom  but i didn't even know how to download where it went to i had to look through the whole computer  oh god only knows where those things ended up oh no  mother found it mother mother may have found it mother i was being naughty with her computer her gateway  it took a half hour to download oh yeah so yeah but it was worth every every oh boy wasn't it 14k 
[00:41:00]  and then 56k how did it start 14 then 28 8 i was on bulletin board service on 300 baud modem  my friend text wouldn't go through fast i lost trivia contests because some people had 900 baud modems  oh boy that's not good is that fast right no that's pretty slow and then they got up i think um  i think an iceberg is fast it was 14 14 4 was like the first real yeah one 14 4 28 8 right and 
[00:41:30]  then jumped to 92 now 56 that no i remember 56 in there somewhere and then they were like if you got  two of them if you got 256 came out jesus yeah oh  c prompt we can sign up with the c prompt logging on all right we gotta take a break uh when we get  back more from when anchors go bad we didn't get to play the weather one because the stupid robot was  like conducting an orchestra in the future and while we're here in the future yes also uh sex in the 
[00:42:00]  city the countdown is uh 16 days we gotta i can't wait tim is paying attention he's he's now got a  official sweepers and stuff and uh we got the sex in the city trailer and we got the the gang doing a  scene from sex in the city we're all very excited about the uh premiere can you tell this should get  the ratings up huh opie and anthony  you're checking out the opie and anthony show we got a busy one today robert kelly in studio

[00:44:30]  but then she made a dumb mistake and everyone should move on but uh we broke out some of our  favorite uh clips of when anchors go bad we were just uh we were discussing the weatherman fight  yep uh and then we got distracted by the robot that was conducting the orchestra so yeah if we  could shiny things really get us why would you want a robot to do that like it could conduct your  like who figured that out you should never know that that he can actually do that what's his name  waste of resources what's that robot's name we've seen him it's osmo or something like that 
[00:45:00]  osmo we saw him at i am osmo we saw him at the ces kicking a soccer ball and uh walking in a  it is freaky to watch it and walking upstairs yeah i could go upstairs it ran it was really it's  like running across the stage do you know eventually people will be fighting for robot rights maybe within  a hundred years you'll beat a robot with a stick and people will get upset with you i guarantee  because they look they'll look human it'll be too realistic looking that would be hysterical  because i would just make a point of like raping the robot in the parking lot 
[00:45:30]  robot rape the future the crimes of the future  teaching your robot a lesson yeah yeah you just smack it around like this it'll push your shopping  cart i think jimmy's right it'd push your shopping cart around in the store and then what if it keeps  going you just like smack in the head hey stupid stop yeah then you get people all mad at you  these little legs would kick as your robot legs here's uh osmo that's me the detroit symphony 
[00:46:00]  orchestra was led by an unlikely conductor last night you can check this out a shiny four foot tall  white robot called asimo i guess no it's not asimo you dummy asimo do your research it's at least  asimo asimo or asimo but it's not asimo i guess careful right took the stage 
[00:46:30]  careful led the symphony in a performance of impossible dream from the musical of course man  of la mancha asimo you think these musicians are going to pay attention to a robot like they need  that just goes to show you what the conductor does right i think they know how to play their  instruments the conductor was the guy that like couldn't play anything i think right and he just  shows up it's just a gym i want to play too all right grab a stick he's a gym teacher wave it  really is worthless michael j fox's future job watch too much but he can only do flight of the bumblebee 
[00:47:00]  a little culture joke for you  i'd be all over the place trying to follow the horse  man of la mancha asimo stands for advanced step in innovative mobility  it was designed by honda motor company the robot even took a bow that's pretty neat  look i looks like there's somebody in there yeah i bet what a midget c3po hiding out in there 
[00:47:30]  c3po's in there wait a minute who's hiding out in there asimo  these anchor people are the dumbest people on earth they they truly are it's based totally on  their look and how they read and if they can read that's it without tripping up all right when anchors  go bad so the cnn weatherman uh it was hurricane katrina we think i'm pretty sure so this was his  big moment and he really wanted to over explain the weather and the anchor lady wanted nothing to 
[00:48:00]  do with this cut him off he was getting a little uh it was like overselless it's like will you just  you know give us the basics here no one cares about your your your weather jargon this is how this  is how it went down a couple of hours ago so it has filled in a little bit filled in with some  air not as low of pressure but camille let me talk carol  you know we should add a little more of what he was saying before that  because it shows like it shows how stupid he was yeah like that doesn't really it shows her 
[00:48:30]  jumping in but doesn't really show like he was just babbling yeah we could help it along obviously  he was going on he was long-winded and it was about barometric pressure yeah and and she was just  completely fed up with it chad's a bore and carol is a castrating c oh what a bitch  oh chad got wedgies in school when he was growing up yep chad's garbage  a couple of hours ago so it has filled in a little bit filled in with some air 
[00:49:00]  not as low of pressure but camille let me talk carol translate that for us i don't know what that  means what does that mean well if you would let me talk oh camille camille was 908  and so this is actually now not as strong as camille but not really as now he's all tripped up  it's been 908 i'm walking over here she broke his rhythm i can have this chart but it's not in front  of me see she broke she totally took him out she she dismembered him that was it he didn't know 
[00:49:30]  this was the eight uh three nine i'm at his chad this was his big moment and she just she blew up  his spot she whizzed on it yeah but she she actually he he thought he she was going to tell  him to uh shut up but she just wanted him to dumb it down for us she was just like hey can you tell  us what that yeah so he snapped he snapped for the wrong reason but the way he she did it though  chad chad chad now yeah you dumb it down for our stupid audience then he tried to dumb it down but 
[00:50:00]  he couldn't no i had a chart here oh good gravy but he said something like gravy he just lost it  it's not as bad as camille but it is worse than it has been he said yeah yeah he she ruined him  some non-point he made she she was every like attractive girl to him in school yeah that he would  just start sweating profusely uh when they came near him that was what she did yeah she talked to  him like that and he just became a child high school yeah you want to movies me to the take you 
[00:50:30]  what you know you know most weather weathermen are gay that's a fact oh yeah oh that's i used to have  a gay roommate who was becoming a weatherman oh really he used to practice his blue screen on me  oh really techniques how did he spell it but uh yeah he told me okay thank you jimmy wow  wait but that doesn't make him gay because you know one gay guy who has wanted to be a weatherman  now they're all fruits yeah i know you know one guy now that you know that what now that you know 
[00:51:00]  that because he did it to me too now that you know that watch all gay all weathermen you're gonna be  like wow that guy is gay i didn't know he was gay watch all right we're gonna do that i know a couple  uh that have been uh pretty prominent here in new york that have been a little swishy no watch it  now it's gonna be on your mind i'm not gonna say their names because you know you don't want to  make allegations like that we met a weatherman recently on the streets all man this guy was all  man and all man and made sure he told us so maybe he's he's heard the uh the chattering and he wanted 
[00:51:30]  to make sure that we knew that he was all man all man creeped us out this guy he leaned in within  three minutes of knowing him yeah and brag telling us about sex exploits and brag that he's banging  a bra that's 25 26 years younger than him and then oh wow he was just all man oh yeah let's get  back to this uh this clip weird too you never see any big fat pigs that are like anchors hold on  bill from waterford you are correct sir he was naming the weatherman that's all man yeah all man 
[00:52:00]  bragging about his age bragging about his sex ploys i'm like dude i we just met you relax how  about i'm down how about a hey how are you doing the only people that are fat are weathermen too  that there's never any fat anchors it's really weird when you look at all the they never you can  be husky if you're a sports guy you can be husky yeah like a linebacker yeah yeah can be fat though  never a big fat morbidly obese anchor i guess because nobody wants to listen to you in life 
[00:52:30]  like yeah you don't get any respect anyone if i i i i want to leave radio i want to be a news  director and i want to just do really i want to do the fat news two huge fat anchors a huge fat  weatherman a huge fat reporter i wouldn't watch that i would watch every night and i would advertise  that it's the fat news fat news and it's all about just awful like uh you know uh food stories and  just oh just over the top fat you can just hear them breathing into the microphone wheezing  oh yeah the weatherman is a burn victim oh it's gonna be really hot today 
[00:53:00]  so i'll be in the house my face sure could use some rain and i know heat  it's gonna be windy so hold on to your wings  and wear sunglasses because your eyes can't shut  it's gonna be a dry day bring plenty of visine it's gonna be windy today so i'm gonna have to

[01:02:00]  i love  i love this song  they performed it live on our show  yes  uh the station here in new york really loves this song  because they play it every hour  i don't uh i don't change the station when uh when this song comes on  it's a guilty pleasure  yeah i like it  no it's more than a guilty pleasure  it's a cool riff  it's just short of being a rock song  what  you know what i mean  just short of  yeah it's like pop rock  yeah 
[01:02:30]  yeah absolutely  i'm not trashing finger 11  no i'm saying like  these guys are friends of ours actually  they've done the show a few times  rock doesn't have to all be thrash  or hardcore or something  it could  music lovers know what i'm talking about  it's just short of being a legit rock song  this isn't matchbox 20  no  no  opie and anthony on your radio dial  all right  i  we don't know what to do with this  it's  it's  it's a bit in progress  we're brave enough to  to tell you that 
[01:03:00]  other radio stations would not go on the air with  with things until they got it all figured out  but that's the beauty of our show  we like to try to  just throw this stuff on the air  and see where it goes  anthony and i are obsessed  with the fact that  sex in the city  the movie is coming out soon  we're not going to go see this movie  no  we don't understand why  there's such a buzz on this movie  yeah i'm obsessed with the phenomenon  the whole thing around it  the  the way these  the media is covering this  and no one's bringing up the fact that 
[01:03:30]  these are  four  or at least  three and a half  hags  i'll go three out of four  the  the dark haired one  and this is  this is talking about is  is like uh  okay  kristin  davis  now listen  i i saw this uh  the trailer for sex in the city  for the first time in the office  because we're really trying to get our  sex in the city knowledge  well  yes  and this  so three out of the four  are cougars  at best  they're hags  okay  the fourth one 
[01:04:00]  kristin davis is the hot one  she's the brunette  yeah  they have her knocked up in the movie  she's not even  yeah  so they  so they  you can't even see her looking all sexy and stuff  she's  she's  very pregnant in the trailer i was watching  opie let me ask you something  as somebody  i'm talking about you  who  no  who has watched the show  somebody who has watched sex in the city  i'm the only one  as i know you have  i'm the only one  um  was she  look it's not gonna make any difference whatsoever  but it was on  no i i understand 
[01:04:30]  back in the day  when i was  living in hell  that's fine  that's fine  i understand  as somebody who watched the show faithfully  you watched this faithfully  did uh  was the dark haired one  uh  sexual on the show  was she one that like  would would have the sex  because i know  samantha was quite the animal  that's why  men and women  will never truly get along  because kirsten davis  would would be the one  you'd want to see  uh  having all the sex  right  she was pretty hot  but guess what  she had to be more the prudish one  was she the prude  and the innocent one 
[01:05:00]  and the  the uh  the  she can't believe what the others  gals are doing  exactly  so  so lucky us  we get the  the oldest of all of them  being the one that's  you know  having all the sex  and talking about  kim cattrell  with that chocolate chip  on her face  speaking of  chocolate chip  i was with this guy chip  and his black friend  last night  the atlanta hawks  came to town  are you having more  sex are you 
[01:05:30]  i think i washed  a blouse with one  of my sweat socks  oh i shouldn't  use sock  because i can't say  pink sock  so it's okay  to be a whore  because you can't go  sock sock  i understand jim  it's just another  look you can try it  that's okay  no no hold on  i'm just gonna crash  and bail  i washed my thing  with my black sweat socks  and then i got a pink sock  you can use socks  in a row  yeah  if you make it a point  to use socks  damn  comedy's so hard  black sock  and then i got a pink sock  what are you guys doing  we're just running through it here  like if you say  anthony was mad at himself 
[01:06:00]  because he said black sock  but if you just said  a black sock  and then i got a pink sock  it would be like  no  yeah  black sock and pink sock  pink sock  are you teaching a course  at like stand up  no  i know what he means  he's powerful  anthony's very smart  the annex  anthony was always  the annex  the jim norton annex  yeah hey  rape equals validity  we used to do  fart equals funny  speaking of which  coming up  on this radio show  we're doing  gas for gas 
[01:06:30]  yes  we finally figured out  what kind of gas promotion  we want to do  oh we're gonna give out  free gas  and the media should run  with this  we really are gonna be  giving out free gas  they'll run  and i think in two or three  different locations  we're going all out  free gas for our listeners  but the catch is  you gotta like  give some gas  to get some gas  so if you can't like  fart on the spot  you don't get our free gas  gas for gas  is there any way  of measuring  like how good  or dense 
[01:07:00]  a fart is  you have to have people's faces  right next to you  yeah of course  so back to sex in the city  16 days and counting  before the movie  very excited  hits the theaters  and today we start  with our sex in the city  coverage  by just trashing  rolling stone magazine  we've talked about  how much they have  lost it  and they just  by the way  if you want guys  to see the sex in the city  movie  you would have  casted the chicks  from the hills  the hills  oh my god  that's a cover 
[01:07:30]  of rolling stone  with the girls  from the hills  some show  I've never seen  in my life  you're gonna start  watching immediately  though right  wow  look at the ass  see you cast  these girls  for the sex in the city  movie  guess what  now you're gonna  do some numbers  cause every guy's  gonna go see it  with their broad  their broad  the word of the day  once again  is broad  they had Sarah's  hands on TMZ  yesterday  they just showed  her hand  they didn't tell you  who it was  they showed her hand  guess who this is  and it looks  like a guy  hand  whose hands were they  Sarah Jessica Parker 
[01:08:00]  oh yeah yeah  her hand  is atrocious  yeah pretty bad  they were calling it  Frankenstein hand  and then they just  pull back  and it's her  mole witch face  attached to that  that zombie hand  looks like they got her  out of Raiders of the Lost Ark  you're obsessed  with the mole too  right Robert  oh that mole  it's not sexy  I had a few moles  guess what  you go to a dermatologist  they snip those  uppers right off  I had 18  down where you shouldn't  have them  I had all 18 
[01:08:30]  oh Jesus  those aren't moles  they look like mushrooms  oh god  but those aren't moles  no  one bad sexual experience  you get a bunch of  shiitakes  I did it  I look like tree hands  that kid from India  alright if I didn't know  any better  I went to TMZ here  and I'm looking at the  picture that Bobby  just described  go to TMZ.com  I'm looking at that hand  and if you didn't know  Sarah Jessica Parker's hand  you would think it was  the old lady from the  Titanic movie  no exaggeration 
[01:09:00]  you would say that  ladies  that's a hand of an  80 year old lady  easy  easy  wow  did you see  Madonna's arms  by the way  yeah they showed  those in the  Daily News  her man arms  she's 50 now  with man arms  yeah definitely yoga arms  they have more than yoga arms  she needs a little bit  of body fat  I think  wow  she needs a little bit  of whole milk  and ice cream  in her diet  but there you go  she's got Iggy pop arms  there you go  the chicks from the hills  they're on the cover 
[01:09:30]  of Rolling Stone magazine  that's what  these girls should have been  in Sex and the City  what is the hills though  it's a TV show  yeah  it's probably  the hottest show ever  I've never seen it  don't know anything about it  but based on the cover  of Rolling Stone  it's gotta be  the hottest show ever  unbelievable  alright so  Rolling Stone magazine  so they review  Sex and the City  listen to this  it's a couple paragraphs  macho men  fear this movie  as the one summer  chick flick  they will be dragged to 
[01:10:00]  no matter how hard  they protest  really  and then  this reviewer writes  relax  it's the ladies  and the metrosexuals  who will make  or break  the film version  of Sex and the City  uh  must viewing  for everyone  who ever cared  about shoes  hair  nails  and men  in that order  alright  we will never  get along  with the opposite sex  is that a guy  writing that film 
[01:10:30]  women eat this crap up  it has to  well I don't know  that's a good question  Jimmy  it is Peter  yeah it's Peter Travers  it's a guy  uh  in that order  the trailer for  Sex and the City  seems to  hard sell the comedy  when the show  always took its time  letting the humor  and even the drama  subtly seep in  oh really  only a fool  would question  Sarah Jessica Parker's  fashion superhero  status as Carrie Bradshaw  Parker is back  along with 
[01:11:00]  Cynthia Nixon  Kristen Davis  and Kim Cattrall  as her cohorts  in negotiating  the shifting definitions  of womanhood  in a big bad city  I can't even listen  to you read this  this is upsetting  sounds good  in a big bad city  how long have they been  off the air  how many years  the hell  I don't know  four years  redefining  womanhood  guys  maybe you should  stop resisting  the movie  you just might  learn something  sorry 
[01:11:30]  Iraq distracted me  with a  yeah I know  a oral  picture  Iraq has the timing  of teeth cancer  is there such a thing  is there such a thing  no I don't want to get it  I certainly wouldn't want it  that means he has  no timing whatsoever  what is that Iraq  it was funny  oh alright  is that her  yeah  is it confirmed  Kristen Davis  in a sex thing  there's never a definite  answer  but supposedly  this is her sex tape  that's pretty hot  yeah  so once again 
[01:12:00]  because no one  heard the last line  because you'd like  to pop up  pornography  at the worst time  ever  guys  maybe  guys  do it  maybe you should  stop resisting  the movie  you just might  learn something  learn something  so Peter Travis  is like you know  chill out  and go see the movie  it's educational  that's realistic too  women who never  have to worry  about paying bills  or anything  they just have money  the best jobs  they can buy  $12,000 shoes  all the women  that watch this  yeah that's real 
[01:12:30]  realistic to you  they're hags  they're getting  guys  they're getting  like young guys  that are really  into them  it's all these  fat housewives  eating fig newtons  trying to lose weight  watching this stupid show  why don't they make  a show of reality  just four fat housewives  who don't get  have sex anymore  just all  they're all on  like weight watchers  counting points  yeah let's say  hi to lucky leo  lucky leo  oh hi  oh leo  leo

[01:13:30]  london premiere  and she used  to wear  huge flowers  and stuff  is to get  your attention  off her face  she could put  a b29  on her head  and you're  definitely  still gonna notice  she could put  a chopped  other head  on her breast  plate  and you'd still  notice that  ugly mole face  i'm obsessed  with the mole  too  get rid of  that dumb thing  i made my wife  get rid of hers  we said it  yesterday  it looks like  the face on mars  you know that  face on mars  picture  that's what a mole 
[01:14:00]  looks like  if you zoom in  anything risen  anything  if you got a razor  and went across it  and sliced it off  just slice it off  yeah it needs to be  cut off  how did you mention  getting a mole gun  what is that  and then i touched it  what is that  i go ugh  that's all you have  to say to a woman  is what is that  what is that  and then go ugh  and guess what  that what is that  thing is gone  tomorrow  whether it's a  dumb shirt  a mole  a fetus  it was going 
[01:14:30]  somewhere  alright we got  the sex in the  city trailer  now  the only reason  we're playing  this is because  it made  anthony physically  ill  yeah  i couldn't  take it  physically ill  listen to this  garbage  the music  stinks immediately  i can't take  this  it's like  an old movie  jazz  i can't

[01:26:00]  doing some  gardening  in order to  make that  hat  you know i  think we  all thought  a lot about  what we  were gonna  wear  and the  best you  came up  with was  a friggin  acorn  maybe i'm  delusional  we're hoping  she loses  the acorn  for the premiere  in the big apple  where she'll be  getting 50 tickets  add the 25 tickets  each of the other girls  are getting  and these broads  are taking up  half the theater  read it and weep  my friends  maybe that's where  the veins are coming  from  stacking up the audience  with skinny ass people  who are actually 
[01:26:30]  gonna laugh at the film  even if it sucks  oh you just said  a mouthful there  sister  then again  would sarah jessica  parker ever do  a movie that  sucked  for sucking movies  i guess  bravo  that seemed a little  um  a little bias  a little harsh  yeah  that wasn't the  real trailer  i just need an  acorn hat removed  by sirhan  68  are we on

[01:41:30]  yeah 30 Rock  is probably  my favorite show  on TV  and they're finally  doing the right thing  and they're giving  this man some lines  oh thanks dude  because when the show  first started  you were kind of  like  I was always  technically  a series regular  but you know  some shows  I'd have a couple lines  some shows  I wouldn't be on  and then  it seems  this past  you know  ten episodes  there'll be a few  episodes where they  use me a lot  they're showcasing you  a lot more  and they've been teaming me  and Tracy up a bunch  absolutely  which is a good team  yeah it's been fun man 
[01:42:00]  I was telling someone  the other day  like  when 30 Rock  first hit  I was thinking  eh  but then you saw  you know  the potential  and that thing  has really  just found  its groove  it's been getting  crazier and crazier  you know  yeah  I like the whole  storyline of me  and Tracy  creating the  porno video game  yeah  that was  that was a lot of fun  you can get  you can get  the show now  on your iPhone  go right to  NBC.com  and watch it  right from your  iPhone for free  oh really  yeah  they just took  this new thing 
[01:42:30]  up for iPhone  what's that called  the it that doesn't  take four hours  it's actually quick  yeah you can watch  it real quick  right on the iPhone  hit the watch  past episodes  so now all I have  to do is buy  an iPhone  is what you're  telling me  that's right  you don't have  an iPhone  no man  open that box  right there  there's some  in there  grab one  alright  hey Judah  are you a  hoarder  you mean like  a pack rat  yeah because  I think you  might be  I remember  you were leaving  last time  and you were  casually talking  about how you 
[01:43:00]  have like  how many of  those hats  do you have  in your apartment  I don't know  I got  hundreds  probably  yeah  hundreds of  those hats  that you make  by hand  yeah  and you got  a tiny little  you don't have  a big place  in New York  right  it's okay  I'm in Queens  so it's cheap  oh you got a little  more for your money  yeah  I have a two  bedroom that's  cheaper than my  studio was in  Manhattan  right  are you really  a pack rat  yeah I'm getting  better though  you're not like  piles of newspapers  that they're going  to find you  under someday  that always makes  me laugh  I hope not  some elderly man  found under the  pile of newspapers 
[01:43:30]  he stacks up  you know  Judah you actually  this is what Judah  does though  he comes down  with these  recorders  yeah I was  going to say  Bobby is actually  you know  Bobby and I  have a  tech connection  because Bobby  is on the  cutting edge  of technology  for recording  Bob always has  the latest  greatest  audio recorder  he just bought  a great video  recorder  is that the  HD one  that's timed  yeah  I just saw that 
[01:44:00]  if you had to  fill the hole  inside of my  loneliness  I get all these  gadgets after Bob  tests them out  wait a minute  to record your  sets you have  the high tech  stuff  yeah  that's like  driving around  I audio record  every set  I do  every set I do  I audio record  but I never  listen to them  never  and I never  tape over  them  why  so  because I'm  I don't know  I have OCD  I'm crazy  you know  so it wasn't  until about a  year or so  ago  where  you know  they have  these new 
[01:44:30]  digital recorders  that don't  record on tape  on audio tape  so until like  last year  I just have  just boxes  and boxes  on audio tape  yeah on tape  and I have  just tapes  everywhere  but he had  a professional  this is what  he'd walk  around with  you know  I had a  dat recorder  he had a  dat recorder  it's like  a movie set  you'd walk  around with  that  I had a  dat the size  of like a  walkman  and I would  record all my  sets on dat  dat was big  in like the  90s  early  mid 90s  that was cool  and I owe it  to Bobby  to switch to 
[01:45:00]  digital man  I'm glad  I helped you  remember my  first digital  recorder  it was like  this big  I got this  flash recorder  that's like  this big  and Bobby's like  what the hell  are you doing  man  and then I  finally got  the little  tiny one  you can just  put in your  pocket  do you know  I saved all my  sets too  and there's a  guy named  a comedian  I forget  what his  name was  but he  Vinny something  and he died  he was from  Philly  and he had  all his  sets  so they had  a bin  with all  his sets  in them  and people  just took  like handfuls  of his  sets  and I guess  a lot  of them  got probably  tossed  or whatever  that's  what happened  it's sort  of like that 
[01:45:30]  discount bin  at Walmart  at the movies  it's like  99 cents  never anything  good in there  we all think  you're going  to go through  our sets  when we're  dead  and find  just gold  you ever  listen to  like an old  set  and you'll  be like  oh maybe  I'll find  some material  that was  like really  good that I  forgot about  you listen to  it and you're  like this is  horrible  you know who  they did that  with is  Bill Hicks  I think they  did yeah  the Bill Hicks  family continues  to put out  CDs of  Bill Hicks  I think they  just had one  not too long  yeah they found 
[01:46:00]  some of his  old tapes  whatever  he was taping  his shows  like anyone else  they're making  CDs out of  so hey  weren't you  talking about  your night vision  on that  camera  I missed  the conversation  about veins  well I was  talking about  the new camera  that I got  and Jim brought  up the  you know he's  looking for  night vision  because he's  going to be  doing tactical  stuff in the  woods  let me tell you  something I  agree man  you gotta get  a camera with  that night vision  absolutely  it's just too  cool too many  cool things  going on  there's only  one thing  going on  with night  vision  with regular  people like  us  we're not 
[01:46:30]  going in the  woods to  videotape deer  in their  natural habitat  the key  the key  with the  night vision  is that  you can be  recording  secretly  and people  are going to  think  oh there's  no way  you can be  recording  because it's  so dark  and you got  it all  isn't there  a green light  there's a green  light that might  give you  black electrical  tape  you don't see  the actual  light that's  shining  you still see  that something's  recording  it's just a red  dot that you  get black  like you said 
[01:47:00]  you get a dot  and you put it  on the dot  the on light  can't you see  green  no  I'll teach you  how to be  stealth man  I know the  red light you  covered  the on light  the green light  doesn't show up  in the visual  spectrum  it only shows  up in infrared  you remember  that hot waitress  at the cellar  I saw the video  yeah  okay I showed you  that video  wait wait you  can't just casually  say that  which waitress  how about you  share with like  the million people  that I had  I forget that  I'm on the show  sometimes and I  feel like we're 
[01:47:30]  on a bus going  to a field trip  and I'm just  yapping  like this is  tourgasm days  listen  there's some  girl at the  give us a hint  give us a hint  she was Spanish  she was sexy  oh my god  she was sexy  yeah I can tell  you more about  wait what color  was her hair  she's Spanish  it was actually  platinum blonde  I was thinking  there was a girl  who was Spanish  she was actually  brunette  she wasn't a waitress  she was a bartender  bartender  sounding even hotter  now 
[01:48:00]  yeah and  like  dirtier than  like sexually  worse than me  like worse than me  and I  and I  I put the little  I put the little  tape on the  camera and I  recorded it  but I was telling  I was telling  Anthony and Jim  that like when you  do record sex  with that night  vision  you can see  the veins  with blood  in them  pulsing  like through  their legs  and you can  that's kind of  hot actually  having sex 
[01:48:30]  with the visible  woman  there was  something going  on with those  those cameras  years ago  where you put  a certain  negative or film  over it  undeveloped film  and you put  the night shot  on and if  women were  wearing black  you could see  through the dress  and there was  stuff on there's  like pictures on  the internet  of such things  I forgot about  that yeah  because your  body heat  does throw off  a certain amount  of invisible light  so in under  the right conditions 
[01:49:00]  that camera will  pick it up  it's like x-ray  vision  yeah yeah  it's like x-ray  vision that's why  you see the veins  and stuff there's  a certain amount  of heat in the  veins that throw  off an invisible  light infrared  and their eyes  when they you  know because  you see their  retinas right  yeah dude  it looks like  creepy  it's like  it's kind of  creepy man  when you when  you watch it  back you know  that that it's  it's kind of  it's kind of  sexy but then  she'll look  into the camera  you're like  what was that  oh god I know  what was I with  then it looks 
[01:49:30]  like two bush  babies on in  a tree just  looking around  a wallaby and  a wombat  going at it  he always looks  so scared in the  dark just  looking around  having sex  Judah's gonna  be at what  Caroline's  yeah Caroline's  Thursday to  Sunday  yeah Caroline's  man it's gonna  be cool  yeah place  rules  it's alright  man  they treat me  nice 
[01:50:00]  yeah  and it's not  too far  I'm gonna eat  a lot of  free food  there that's  my goal  have great  shows  hopefully meet  some hot chicks  and eat a lot  of free food  yeah got a lot  of girls now  because of the  show  you know  that's the  one way to  know how  the show is  doing is by  how many girls  hit on me  really  because without  any show I  would have no  girls hitting on  me  zero girls  and a lot  more girls  hit on me  now a lot  more girls  just want to  get to know  me and talk  to me now  so wow  yeah that's  it's definitely  the show's 
[01:50:30]  picking up  I think  great isn't  it the  vengeance  you can  extract  yeah  that's  right  right  little do  they know  bleach on  her breath  thank you  that was for  high school  junior year  jude is  getting the  poison out  huh  oh yeah  that's why  I hoard  stuff  that's why  I hoard  stuff  everyone  has to  clean her  hair out  in the  bathroom  if you  didn't  think  you'd  have  to  very nice  all right  we're gonna  take a quick  break  there's nothing 
[01:51:00]  truer said  on the show  than what he  just said  all the years  of vile  vengeance  coming back  for everyone  that goes  like this  and a little  tear comes  out  thank you  it's nothing  to do with  you  that's all  the ones  that said  no  when I  asked for  their numbers  it's nothing  personal  it's never  personal  jude it  man  oh uh  before we do  take a break  we got an  update on that  passenger who  fell off the  cruise ship  it turns out  what  oh  supposedly she  was climbing  between the  balconies  oh I think  that's what  he's saying 
[01:51:30]  you know  there's  I don't know  what evidence  there is  just to bring  these guys  up to speed  because you  weren't here  some chick  fell off a  boat  they never  fall off  the cruise  ship  it's the best  way to kill  somebody  the best way  the authorities  don't want to  say this  because they  know this is  an epidemic  this is an  easy crime  to commit  it hurts  their business  and the people  on the boat  want to keep  having fun  so you just  keep going  and they keep  going  and that's  the whole thing  this woman  regardless of  how it happened  they're about  45 miles off 
[01:52:00]  of Atlantic City  she ends up  in the drink  the guy  then reports  her missing  or says  she fell  it's still  sketchy  and they  do a search  and the ship  continues on  its way  so what you  have is the  ideal conditions  where no one's  watching  you toss  someone overboard  the crime scene  leaves  and the  investigators  by the time  they even  look at  anything  it's been  so tainted  that even  if they  found that  you did  something  there's no  evidence  like they  just 
[01:52:30]  they completely  ruin the crime  scene by  trotting  upon it  and  doing  conga  line  over the  crime scene  as they're  drinking  banana  daiquiris  that's a new  way to get  chicks actually  I could hang  outside  cruise ships  in the water  in like a little  lifeboat  and just wait  for drunk  chicks to be  thrown off  and I'll take  them  I can rescue  them  and she'll  dig me  and it'll  be great  no one  climbs between  balconies  that's insane  and apparently  this guy  according to 
[01:53:00]  the woman's  parents  has some  kind of record  of beating  her in the  face  maybe there  was a really  bad comic  on the boat  and that's  why she  jumped off  or something  maybe  it was only  four hours  into the  trip  and they  said she  was trying  to climb  four hours  into the  trip  and she's  climbing  balcony  climbing  around  like why  was she  in one  room  trying to  get around  to the  other  room  what do  you think  get away  from the  punching  she was  leaving a  19 year old  boy's room  trying to  get back  that's the  only way  that could  happen 
[01:53:30]  is if  she was  screwing  around  maybe  she's  next door  she doesn't  have a  key to  her room  I don't  know  and she  tries to  climb  around  but  it's  something  why the  hell  would  you  couldn't  possibly  do  that  you  look  down  and go  there's  no way  I'm  doing  this  and by  the way  the night  vision  works great  on cruise  ships  because I  took my  camera with  the night  vision  and at  two in  the morning  you go  out on your  and search  them  and believe  me  someone's 
[01:54:00]  screwing  on the  boat  out on the  balconies  at the  wee hours  in the  morning  nice  maybe  they were  having sex  on the  balcony  and she  fell off  maybe she  lost her  grip  she's  holding on  to the  railing  that would  be a nice  one  it was  freshly  polished  and slid  right off  just kind of  push her  right off  the edge  gotta take a  break  through to  Freelander  at Caroline's  starting tomorrow  night  through the  weekend  and then  Robert Kelly  has got a  big show  at the  Count Basie 
[01:54:30]  Theater  in Red Bank  New Jersey  June 6th  me Patrice  O'Neill  and Mike  DeStefano  call 732-842-9000  Opie and  Anthony  full house  today  of course  you got  Jim North  we also have  Robert Kelly  today  and Judah  Freelander  who's going  to be at  Caroline's  here in  New York  City  212-757-4100  for tickets  we were just  asking Judah  how is Alec Baldwin  to work with  yeah he's the  man dude  you know  he's so cool 
[01:55:00]  and he's a guy  that likes to  laugh  you know  because guys  you work with  all they're  concerned about  is you not  upstaging them  and them  stealing the show  and I was just  telling Bob  how it's like  there was one  episode  where we're all  getting ready to go  to this crazy party  and people are like  oh the Harlem Globetrotters  are going to be there  Kanye West is going  to be there  and then he had  a line where  he says  the girl from  Heroes is going  to take a shower  at the party 
[01:55:30]  and then he goes  you know  I think your character  would more likely  say this than me  you do that line  I'm like  awesome  thanks  so he gave me  that line  yeah  and it's just like  you know  it takes a lot of  I think just confidence  and just  someone who's just  so generous  to just give up  a funny line  like that  you know  yeah  he's the man  he's great  and he just  he went and saw  your stand up  one day  yeah  he came to this  club that actually  just went out  of business  Comedy Village  it went out  of business  last week  yeah  it was just  a little club  in the village 
[01:56:00]  there  and yeah  you know  we're hanging out  on set  I said  he said  you know  what are you doing  later  I'm like  oh I'm doing  a show  he's like  I'm going  I'm going  to your show  I want to go  to your show  when is it  where is it  I'm like  oh it's just  this little club  he's like  I'm going  I'm going  I'm there  so I'm like  yeah  so he showed  up you know  all by himself  and yeah  he loved it  he was great  that had been  a bit weird  yeah it was cool  man  no it was  he's a cool dude  you know  he's like a man's man  people just like him  you know  he's just cool  he used to come in  to Mineta Tavern  with his ex-wife 
[01:56:30]  Kim  I was in there  one night  with a chick  and Kim  went to the bathroom  and I told her  to go to the bathroom  and sit on the same toilet  you're such an ass  I just figured  maybe the little whiff  the little whiff  of the bass singer  does he have  little fat sausage fingers  that's what I heard  he's got little fat fingers  no he's a big dude  he's a big guy  yeah  that whole man's man thing  right  yeah he's not a little dude  he's a big guy  strapping  yeah I've met all the Baldwin's 
[01:57:00]  they're all pretty big dudes  yeah  yeah  they're all insane  which one did we have  on our show  for a while there  they're quite a bunch  yeah  all right yeah  Stephen Baldwin  he would come in  and rant and rave  and just lose his  freaking mind  on our show  I think he's born again  yeah this was way  before that  oh okay  we understand  when he said  he needs to be  a born again Christian  we kind of understood  because we  saw the other side of it  we saw the  pre born again Christian  Stephen Baldwin  no one really ever 
[01:57:30]  just kind of wakes up  and goes  eh you know  today I'm going to be  born again  eh  yeah  there's usually  some kind of  horrid thing  that has to happen  you gotta bottom out  yeah he just killed  a kitten from throwing  against the ceiling  why do I do this  yeah you gotta  you gotta be crying  into your hands  saying why  why  and then you can be  a born again  yeah and then you're ready  well I'm not there yet  when you look down  there's a tent in your pants  and you're like  I have to turn to Christ  yeah speaking of God 
[01:58:00]  well Einstein  this is news today  yeah why is this news today  this is what I don't understand  because he's been dead for  God how long  ten years  five years  five ten years  five is five  perhaps  but this is news today  Einstein says  belief in God  is childish  and that Jews  are not the chosen people  that's news today  all right there  Einstein  ha ha ha ha  huddle huddle  you know 
[01:58:30]  if Einstein  thinks God  is childish  oh boy  must be a slow news day  oh boy  we're in trouble  we could do  slow news day  stories  no we got a 911  dispatcher  saying something  awful  listen to this  when you call 911  in an emergency  you don't expect  to hear this  I really just don't give a  what happens  yeah  while Sheila Jones  hung up right before  the 911 operator  made the offensive comment  it capped three hours  of frustrating calls  for the Nashville woman  we literally right here  is when  bam 
[01:59:00]  he got me  Jones made multiple calls  what  they needed a quote  they needed a quote  from the victim  and that's all  they could get  listen to that  literally right here  is when  bam  he got me  Jones made multiple calls  what is he saying  I don't know  what the hell was that  for the Nashville woman  we literally right here  is when  bam  he got me  Jones made multiple calls  to 911  when her angry ex-boyfriend  barged into her house  I felt danger 
[01:59:30]  I felt threatened  I felt fear  and I felt  I felt  it was like  I was seeing myself  being dead today  that day  I think she's close  to being born again  yeah very  this could have  yeah  this could have turned her  how come she  yelled for the police  when there's trouble  please  please 
[02:00:00]  please  send the police  and the other day  it's like  get out of the neighborhood  po-po  po-po  po-po  Jones says  dispatchers told her  that the officers  responding to her house  were diverted  to a higher priority call  and nobody's coming at him  yes ma'am  as soon as  the sergeant  gets an officer  by the police  I'm sending somebody  out there  what do y'all  want him to kill me  so he can put  yellow paper around  and say  we got there  just for the devil  is that it  I don't want to stay here  Jones spoke with  several dispatchers  that day 
[02:00:30]  one spent 15 minutes  on the phone with her  and even called Jones  back to check on her  but the last dispatcher  Jones spoke with  wasn't as compassionate  I'm scared  people  he's out  my f***ing house  I really just don't give a f***  what happened  they took a call  from the mayor's office  to bring the police  to her house  the police chief  will only say  that the last dispatcher  Jones spoke with  was no longer  with the department  yeah but why is he 
[02:01:00]  in trouble  that happened after  the phone call  was done  not being compassionate  but how do they  get the tape  this guy might be good  because he's cool  he's not getting all excited  yeah he was just like  I don't give a  what happens to you  yeah because when  the other people  who are having the problems  they're all flustered  he's got to remain calm  yeah  he was able to do it  this guy might be  the best guy  he doesn't care  he doesn't get  emotionally involved  I got a  I got a Judah 
[02:01:30]  Freelander observation  what is it  he's 30 Rock Cash  he's done our show a lot  but I see you're like  30 Rock Cash  well this is  what do you mean  you got your leg up  all nice  oh no  it's just a comfortable  couch man  just riffing with the boys  throwing the lines out  I'm having fun man  it's fun coming in  I see the change  and it's good to see  oh okay  hey we got a bar owner  selling racist Obama shirts  too  this is big news today  oh boy  are you  where are you at  with this presidential election  you know 
[02:02:00]  I  I don't like politicians  man  I don't like any  look man  I'm not into your  politics man  I don't trust any of them  look how he's saying it  to all cats  I don't trust any of them  I really don't  they all  power to the people  they all say stuff  to get your votes  and then  then they just  you know  work for themselves  and  take your money  through taxes  and do  all kinds of  you know  swindles and stuff  pretty much it  yeah  it's just the same thing 
[02:02:30]  sums it up  pretty much  I don't trust  are you thinking  there's going to be  this big change  with Obama  if Obama gets elected  that this  his whole platform  is this sweeping change  I think there will be  a tiny bit more  than with one of the other people  yeah  but hardly anything  they would really notice  yeah  I don't think  it would be nearly as much  as people think  there's going to be  because everyone  no matter what candidate  you're voting for  like the people  that are voting for McCain  think  he's going to save America 
[02:03:00]  the people  that are voting for Hillary  and Obama  they think  wow  they're going to save America  it's like  one person can't do it  you know  and especially when  they probably  don't even want to do it  you know  and  does America need saving  I mean our economy  is  that's another point  kind of sucks right now  the gas prices  we want that  to go down a bit  there's a lot of crazy things  always going on  but the fact  I think  where people get into a problem is  they think  this one person  can just solve  all their problems  and that's just not 
[02:03:30]  how the world works  man  it's more complicated  than that  and I don't think  people are all great  and everyone's black and white  everyone's got good qualities  and bad qualities  and the system's in place  that you can't make major changes  no matter who you are  we were trying to figure out  on the show  who was the last president  that had true power  like real power  yeah  and I also think  Woodrow Wilson  I also think the government  is very corrupt  the government's very corrupt  drop a couple  you know 
[02:04:00]  from both parties  to me both parties  are like  to me both parties  are like gangs  they're both like gangs  to me they're like  two different gangs  and they both feed  into the big corporations  which own everything  you know  wow you are a man  yeah  welcome to the sunshine hour  I think someone in this studio  has been smoking some pot  I'm just very deep  I'm just very deep  I didn't even know 
[02:04:30]  you had material on politics  no I don't  it's a good take  on the whole thing  I barely touch politics  what do you think of Hillary  and how she's not  dropping out of the race  for the good of the party  I think it's pretty hilarious  man  I mean  I hope she never stops running  I hope it's like  2010  and she's still like  showing up in states  and people are like  the election's over  and she's still flipping pancakes  Judah sounds like  he's been taking pictures  of Marlon Brando  in the jungle  nothing  I don't understand  wow not only nothing  apocalypse now 
[02:05:00]  that wasn't only nothing  that stopped the show dead  just say this  Judah looked like  he was taking pictures  of you  now that's a funny tag  on a crappy joke  sure it is  1980  just made the cut  thank you Jimmy  alright  alright so  but the Hillary thing  I mean it just seems hilarious  everyone's  every time I turn the news  they're like  they're like  there's no way she can win  and yet she's still out there  and it's just  she's 20 million dollars  in debt  I just heard today 
[02:05:30]  and it's just  it's hilarious  she's a professional campaigner  the whole thing is hilarious  she was told her whole life  that she could be the first  female president  of the United States  and she can't accept  the fact that it's not happening  because this is  what's really bad too  because  she's not going to have a chance  at this anytime soon  another four years  at the very  if she  she should take the  she should take the  vice president thing  if she can  they're not going to give it to her  I don't  yeah probably not  you know  but then again  I know nothing about  bald dicks 
[02:06:00]  you really shouldn't  listen to me  let's get into the  Obama thing  so this is what's going on  county on alert  come county  protesters shout out  their opposition  to a t-shirt  that's a clear slap  at Barack Obama  it shows a cartoon  eating a banana  with the caption  Obama in 08  we are all in this together  you need to get your  off my parking lot  is what you need to do  just about now  oh boy  this could be a problem  you know  just listening to those  two voices together  I don't see  harmony  and peace happening there 
[02:06:30]  sounds like a  chapelle skit  that sounds like  the guy  Beavs and Butthead  used to always mess  with that old dude  yeah  what are you doing  what  hey boy  yeah  hey  you're a colored person  get off my property  yeah  well  it's America  you should be allowed  to just do whatever  you want  you know  yeah  I don't agree with it  I hear you man  I'm with you  I say give peace a chance  yeah  yeah  we are all in this together 
[02:07:00]  you need to get  off my parking lot  is what you need to do  just about now  take a good look at this  uh oh  supposing  we caught up  on Reverend Dr. Matilda King  to come up  and take a look  what would he say  the tavern owner  denies  I've been dead  and please  can someone  get me a new suit  and him and those  friends took their  spears and circled  his house  Jesus  Bobby  he's talking about  the mech tribe  nothing  what are you gonna do  don't just take 
[02:07:30]  a swig of coffee  and punch out  explain yourself  I did a Nick DiPaolo  this is our careers  you ass  I did a Nick DiPaolo  that's what happens  I've been watching  a lot of shows  since I've been  a world traveler  I hear you  I've been uh  you know  any Van Halen tickets  uh the bar's called  Mulligans by the way  here we go  what would he say  the tavern owner  denies the t-shirt  is offensive  how can you deny  it's not offensive  it's Curious George  with a banana  it is Curious George 
[02:08:00]  Curious George  with a banana  and this is Obama  in 08  but I like the news  how they don't even  describe what it is  they just say cartoon  say what it is  yeah they're too scared  to say what it is  that is certainly  offensive to people  it's a monkey  with a banana  and he's selling it  as an Obama shirt  but you can't pass it off  as not racist  that's what it is  that's awful  just be honest  about what it is  yeah if you're gonna  make a racist t-shirt  say you got racist t-shirts  racist t-shirts  that's it  but you best get  your ass off my property  the t-shirt is offensive  that offends them 
[02:08:30]  they are hunting  a reason to be offended  I looked and I thought  man look at those ears  and his hairline  that's what I saw  I didn't see anything offensive  that had been  a historical stereotype  of how African Americans  have been depicted  oh no  why did they  why did they interview  that guy  no he didn't  what happened  what happened  who was that  Tyrone Voss  depleted  I'm being depleted  in a bad light  how do you spell that 
[02:09:00]  Bob didn't even know  what he did wrong  oh I know  oh Jesus  don't make me stupid  I knew it  depleted  wasn't a word  God did that  sure did  of how African Americans  have been depleted  alright  come on  you know  you know  they're both  napalm  should have just been  dropped on the bar  at that point  when they were both  in the same place  you know how many  black people  were in their  apartments and saw that  and went  oh no 
[02:09:30]  oh no  oh you didn't  just say  depleted  but you know  how many  actually went  he's right  we've been depleted  of how African Americans  have been depleted  on a number of occasions  despite the outcry  one person here  says the shirts  are selling  a few people  calling in mad  but for the most part  people won't know  how to get shirts  the tavern owner  says money  from the sale  of the shirts  is going to charity  but that doesn't  impress these protesters  who want the locals  to boycott the restaurant 
[02:10:00]  that's the type of shirt  you can't just wear  everywhere  it's going to buy  sheets  and crosses  I don't see it  as racist though  you just wire a sheet  on your head  cut out a couple of holes  it could be like  Casper the ghost  that's what it is  it's a Casper costume  all they have to do  is go boo  burn the cross  on the lawn  it's just  it's what I do  the guy can't  fess up to the fact  that he's being  a little racist  we have a guy  on the phone  that I think 
[02:10:30]  has been to that bar  Jeff in Atlanta  Jeff  yeah I drive by  there all the time  and on his marquee  he always has  a nice comment  on there  like border agents  eat free  he's very down  on immigrants  of all sorts  including the locals  and where is this bar  it's on  Roswell Road  near Cobb Parkway  it's on a main drive  can you zoom out

[02:15:00]  he made the walk even though he's got like a big meeting  in like 10 or 15 minutes  Opie and Anthony show  here we are  hey  sorry I was talking to you  I couldn't hear you because  I don't have headphones  oh that's  oh well  I guess you have to go  alright  well we'll see you tomorrow everybody  I seem to have my headphones  I don't know what happens  but  we want to start by saying this  we hate  thank you sir  well I want to wait for Anthony to have this  no no  I know what you're going to say  okay good good  we hate  Friendly Bob  and we want to have an intervention right now 
[02:15:30]  Friendly Bob is an ass  Friendly Bob stinks  Friendly Bob visits  Friendly Bob  loves cock  in the elevator  and I hate him  I'm just  I don't understand  and Bob goes  after the whole thing  he goes  that was Friendly Bob  and I go  I know  you told me that last time  we remember  see when we go into this building  what is it  the famous Steinway building  here in New York City  everyone has to pile into the elevator 
[02:16:00]  I don't know why  but  it's easy  it's easy  it's easily what  12 people in the elevator  yeah it's crazy  there's too many  pack them in  and Bob decides  that he needs to be  Friendly Bob  and get to know  the  the fellow elevator riders  no no no no  no no no  get it right  he has to get to know  a young lady  in the elevator  no sometimes it's you man  last time young  he did do it  alright I wouldn't  he did do it  Asian boy  there was an Asian guy 
[02:16:30]  there's been a black African dude  yeah  I've had an Arab  see I think the most  uncomfortable thing  in the planet earth  to do nowadays  actually say hello to somebody  in an elevator  what's your name  yeah  what's your name  it really is  it makes somebody  really uncomfortable  you face everybody  on the elevator  you're not staring at the door  like everyone else  so you're turned around  and then you just pick someone out  and go  hi how are you  I'm Bob  and you put your hand out  and shake their hand  and then they're compelled 
[02:17:00]  to now tell you their name  and then get this conversation  so you work in the building  and I'm like  all I'm thinking is  of course you work  in the fucking building  you know  she could be visiting  she looked like she was  working in the building  well she does  she's actually works  in the building  she's worked for three years  right out of college  I know  of course I heard  the whole conversation  I was a foot away from you  yeah  from stupid friendly Bob  we were awkwardly  six inches away from you  as you're conducting  the one and a half  minute interview  and that's another thing  I don't know how the person  feels that you're conversing with  but it makes everyone  in the elevator uncomfortable 
[02:17:30]  I think the person  he's talking to though  likes it because  there's some interaction  going on  I guess it takes up time  but not everybody  because there's a few  in this studio  that certainly don't agree  with this  but I think everybody  in general wants  some kind of interaction  yeah  but don't know how  to go about it  when they're walking  the streets of New York  well it's just uncomfortable  to be in that situation  in the elevator  you're not part of the  conversation  but you're hearing  every bit of it  but the weird part is  I'm not even  I'm not even being  offensive or rude  I'm actually being  friendly Bob 
[02:18:00]  and I'm saying  hello my name's Robert  what is your name  and they have to answer me  and it makes people  feel uncomfortable  Bob the elevator  is your cunt shaved  it's the same  uncomfortable feeling  yeah  it was already  too crowded  before you walked  in there man  yeah that's another thing  he walked in  and the elevator  was already packed  the elevator was full  ready to close  and Bob's like  there's plenty of room  there's plenty of room  for everybody  I'm like  I'll take the next one  for friendly Bob  friendly Bob  for people who aren't friendly 
[02:18:30]  it might be a little packed  but for friendly Bob  I don't mind standing  face to face  with some friendly Bob  yeah  oh does he suck  makes it an uncomfortable  ride for everybody  I want to thank  five hour energy  for the free product today  so friendly Bob  is that  wait  what happened  I think we're supposed  to incorporate it  into the program  somehow  casually right  yeah  I think I did it casually  like in general conversation  so back to friendly Bob  if you drank  if you drank that drink  you did it casually  thanks for hooking up 
[02:19:00]  the listeners  to five hour energy  five hour energy  it wakes up your brain  and gets you bright alert  and focus without the jitters  or the crash later in the day  so friendly Bob  I think it's supposed  to be integrated  into the program  in a natural fashion  not blurt it out  like you have Tourette's  you know who takes that  Daryl Hammond  actually takes that  does he  a celebrity endorsement  yeah  at the cellar  on weekends  you'll see him  with that five hour  little energy  that you get at  gas stations in Jersey  on the turnpike  that's good stuff though  because it gives you 
[02:19:30]  all the energy  without a crash later  like caffeine would have  right Jim  that's right  wow  look at that  natural conversation  I a lot of times  will take one  when I'm going to be  stroking my cock  with other gentlemen  in this circle  over a cracker  because I tend to  finish faster  and then I don't  have to eat it  the energy drink  is that the rule  if you come on it  last  you gotta eat it  so why would you  come on it  what  no you try to  come first  this way you build  a nice thick thing  a splooge  because Bob's  a cum eater 
[02:20:00]  we were talking  about that  yes we were  discussing  during commercial  break earlier  I'm fine with  discussing this  but the word  cum eater  just makes me  want to puke  it's a fucking  gross  this is what  we talk about  when we're trying  to be radio  friendly over there  like the breaks  happen and we  start talking  about cum eating  the show  it doesn't change  from XM  and we all believe  in our hearts  that you  Bob Kelly  you are a  cum eater  can I just  say something  friendly Bob  is a cum  not friendly Bob  Bob  friendly Bob 
[02:20:30]  would never eat  cum  but the word  cum eater  just sounds like  the cum is  actually chunky  here's the way  it works  some guy will  jerk you  kind of rougher  than you like  and you're just  not fully hard  and you'll  cum in his hand  and then he'll  just hold his  hand up under  your mouth  and you'll  lap it out of  his hand  you'll feel like  the fucking  rough part of  his knuckles  the calluses  as you eat  your own cum  excuse me  you have to  make it sexy  Jim  excuse me 
[02:21:00]  everybody  I just have  to  like the gym  knows  this cum  eating discussion  brought to you  by  5 hour energy  Jesus Christ  how much cum  I could eat  on a 5 hour  energy drink  wow  yeah  he's gonna be  gobbling that up  after Bob eats  the cum  out of the front  of the hand  the guy will  open it  like he'll  spider web  his hands  open  and Bob  will have  to lick  the stuff  that's leaked  through the  knuckles  onto the back  can I just  talk about  the description  that faggot  has on this  whole conversation  little faggot  Jimmy  he knows 
[02:21:30]  exactly how  it's done  oh yeah  every little  subtle detail  is mapped out  little ashy  knuckles  not at the  cum eating  no  not at all  you've never  tasted cum  oh boy  here it goes  you've never  honestly  no  my own  cum  I might have  licked a pussy  afterwards  but I don't  like it  it skeeves me  you've never  tasted it a little  bit  why would you  taste it  you never  put a little  on your finger  and then put  it on your lips  like  he's a cum eater  like nutrigena  he's a cum eater  I don't think so  but that's probably 
[02:22:00]  how you get started  you like the way  it made you feel  like kind of dirty  but yet like  you were a finisher  next thing you know  you're filling up  shot glasses  what's a finisher  what is a finisher  what is a finisher  faggot  wait  I don't know  yeah you do  no I don't  yeah you do  someone just  put me in names  on the AOL  someone just texted me  no  it's called  the Ookie Cookie  the one  the cum cracker  you load on  yeah Pitsy  Ookie Cookie  Pitsy  from Rana Fez 
[02:22:30]  talked about that  by the way  I gotta give the boys  a plug today  Rana Fez  yeah  we had to come by  here yesterday  to do a little  taping that  you guys will never  ever see  little VO  complete waste of time  but Rana Fez  we're still here  and I gotta say  I think they're gonna  have a very  special  Rana Fez today  really  well that thing  that they were  telling us about  they're gonna  they're gonna  they did a little  extra radio yesterday  I don't think  they're playing that  really 
[02:23:00]  yeah I think  that was like  a you know  they weren't  rolling tape on that  I don't think  they were rolling  tape on that  knowing Rana Fez  they'll at least  discuss it  they'll probably  discuss it  what  well Ronnie  Ronnie fooled me  then  no cause he was  being really sarcastic  that's what I got  when he said  oh yeah yeah  we're just gonna  throw that  right on the air  alright now  you gotta stick around  noon to three  see what the hell  we were talking about  alright  Steven S. from Bayshore  why don't you grab a mic  and feel and look  very uncomfortable  I feel very comfortable  that one right over there 
[02:23:30]  right over there  right over there  Steven S. from  where are you from?  I'm from Bayshore  it's incredible  we forgot to plug you  you sat in all morning  and we  completely ignored you  and then he yelled at me  for not promoting  his rundown today  and then he started  a little ticked  a little miffed  and then he started  yelling at me  because they're not  paying him properly  and he pointed out  that not only is he  not getting paid 
[02:24:00]  properly  other radio websites  like BCN  and the one in Cleveland  are now  what  copy and pasting  they're copying and pasting  it was only supposed to be  for ONA radio  at the KROQ website  that's who I had to deal with  so your column  is now syndicated  it's syndicated  and you're not getting  I feel fancy  but I'm not getting paid  you're not getting compensated for it  I'm not living the fancy man's lifestyle  I live in Bayshore  well hence the name  what's wrong with Bayshore  no Bayshore's fine  all I remember from Bayshore  are the chicks  with the big 
[02:24:30]  sprayed up  Long Island Bayshore hair  the waterfall  the waterfall  we used to call it  it's called the waterfall  or the peacock  because to look  like you have  a fancy plumage  you'd push  all your feathers forward  the girls would take  all their hair  and push it forward  into some big wave  that would come  flying up the top  and the sides  would come flying out  and from the front  they'd have like  this huge lion mane  of hair  and then they'd turn sideways  and it'd be like 
[02:25:00]  what the hell happened  it's like you're  a cartoon character  and that was  absolutely  a Bayshore staple  you could snowboard  off their hair  kind of stuck  in the late 80s  you could snowboard  that shit  yeah  oh man  80s chicks are hot  yeah there's something  about  something slutty about it  yeah  80s  it was sort of  the 70s version  of what the future  was going to look like  the 80s  like with the shoulder pads  and the weird  V type stuff  the angled zipper 
[02:25:30]  yeah a lot of  angled zipper things  it's like  the 80s is the future man  this is how we're supposed  to look in the future  and it just wasn't  it just looked silly  every girl's hair  looks like they did it  upside down  yeah  they like put  like paint on their  faces  that wasn't even makeup  it was literally like  Daryl Hannah in  Blade Runner  where they'd just take  spray paint  and spray it across  their eyes  yeah  everyone's like  Adam Ant  like Adam Ant  little faggot  yeah things like that  like one football  little thing  under their eyes  yeah yeah  you'd take like  two little black  like things

[02:55:30]  after fucking  ten minutes  of trying to  open the can  your tuna is too dry  would you like  some five hour  energy to pour in it  oh  hey  all the energy  without the crash  yes  probably goes great  with tuna  better than olives  Stephen S. from Bayshore  yes  you know what  we're not going to  take a break  oh I thought  you were going to  read an instant feedback  from him  but he's here  don't recall  why don't you sit  with the big boys  Stephen S.  do you want to  sit at the big boy  table  why are you over  at the kid table

[02:57:00]  Can we find Double Fucked by Two Black Studs by King Missile?  Come on. 
[02:57:30]  Watching Jimmy eat is fucking...  He doesn't use his teeth.  He just mushes it on his palate.  He likes his food mushy.  And then it has to come out of his mouth.  He likes to soften it up.  And then he sucks it back in.  What do you do?  Bob just swallows it without chewing.  He just strains the krill through his baleen.  That's a little whale joke.  Pretty good.  I like the fucking...  Nothing wrong with a good marine biology joke.  Yeah, why not?  Strains the krill.  I always try to fit baleen into a show whenever I can. 
[02:58:00]  Absolutely.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  Did you make your own promos for ONARadio.com?  Yes, I did.  I was asked by E-Rock to throw some stuff together.  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  They really bad?  I don't know.  E-Rock?  They're very short.  He said he wanted me to come in and record something.  I said, well, let me try to do them from home.  Do them really quick.  And you don't like them?  E-Rock?  Okay, Keith.  Two seconds.  Sorry.  Needed a message out there.  What happened?  Well, he's got a question because the pool people are there. 
[02:58:30]  And he's got a question about my pool.  So I have to call him up.  Either that or get in touch with my brother, who apparently is going to be a father any second now.  Really?  Wow.  Yes.  Congrats.  Yes.  We're eagerly awaiting that one.  He just emailed me with that.  When we do...  They're on their way to the hospital?  Yeah, they're already at the hospital.  So there's some pumping going on right now.  Well, the water broke.  But more importantly, how am I getting water in my pool?  Use her water. 
[02:59:00]  I'm so selfish.  You're swimming through with your veins in it?  It's pre-warm.  Yeah, invite your whole family over to have their waters burst in your pool.  Wait, we've got to go home.  We can't be here if you're going to be an uncle for the first time.  I know.  Any excuse?  Oh, my God.  Jeez, we've got to go.  Oh, so five-hour energy.  What?  What happened?  That was our second opportunity to get out of here.  We only got an hour to go, guys.  This is fun.  I don't want to leave an hour.  E-Rock.  So Stephen S. from Bayshore has ONA Radio.com promos.  Yes.  Does he?  That's all right.  You have to push the mic away. 
[02:59:30]  And is it true that...  What happened?  Just quick.  Ordering a bunch of stuff.  Hmm.  Should we take a break?  That's old school.  I don't want to eat on the air, and Anthony doesn't want to talk on the air.  Yes.  Let's take a break.  And Bob doesn't want to eat.  We're going with the salt system.  Good move.  No.  We're not going with the chlorine system.  That's old.  Go with salt.  I want new technology.  It's the salt system to filter your pool.  Like sea?  Yeah.  It tastes like cum. 
[03:00:00]  Make sure your pool has a good filter system, because we have a cum eater among us.  Yeah.  Shouldn't the pool go in first before the filter?  Cum eater one more time.  I'm going to cum and throw it on all of you.  Go ahead.  We'll eat it.  And then I'm going to...  Cum eater.  All right, Keith.  Thank you, sir.  I can't cum.  I got nothing.  Okay.  Bye.  All right.  Here we go.  We should cum on cue.  Nice.  All right.  E-Rock handed me the disc of promos that Stephen S. from Bayshore did for ONARadio.com. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  And he said, you better put these on the air, because they're awful, and you're going to  want to make fun of Stephen S. Is that true?  E-Rock.  Not in so many words.  Oh, E-Rock.  So powerful.  Steve's getting really defensive already.  Wow.  Pal Talk is just really psyched looking at Steve at the big boy table.  Oh, hello.  They're very excited for you, Steve.  You too could be at the big boy table.  Yes.  Well, this is what this says today.  Yeah.  That's it.  Yeah.  So I got myself to the table by making bad promos.  I mean, you think I'm stupid? 
[03:01:00]  Well, yes.  Why don't I ask that?  You're going to be featured prominently.  Fantastic.  There we go.  There we go.  Look, it's...  That's better.  Lovely Ray Do.  Hey, Puddle of AIDS, another good song he wants us to play.  The great band Anal Cunt, and the song is called You Robbed the Sperm Bank Because You're  a Cum Guzzling Fag.  Do we have that song by...  Puddle of AIDS and fucking AIDS cunt.  We don't have that.  We don't have that one.  Oh, it's not on Dillette?  We don't have that on the master computer, huh?  That would have been in the master computer.  That's too bad. 
[03:01:30]  We have I Just Saw the Gayest Guy on Earth.  I Just Saw the Gayest Guy on Earth by Anal Cunt.  The last person I passed by, Steve C.  Have you ever heard...  Sorry.  You guys have heard Anal Cunt, right?  Yeah.  AC, as they call them on regular radio.  Listen to this horrific noise.  Can we play that?  Listen to this.  The didgeridoo.  I just saw the gayest guy on Earth.  I just saw the gayest guy on Earth. 
[03:02:00]  I just saw the gayest guy on Earth.  He hangs around in Austin.  I just saw the gayest guy on Earth.  He always wears a tree shirt.  I just saw the gayest guy on Earth.  I just saw the gayest guy on Earth.  I just saw the gayest guy on Earth.  I just saw the gayest guy on Earth.  I just saw the gayest guy on Earth.  I just saw the gayest guy on Earth.  I just saw the gayest guy on Earth.  I just saw the gayest guy on Earth.  I just saw the gayest guy on Earth.  I don't think it does.  Steve's so conscious when he's shaming him.  I just saw the gayest guy on Earth.  I just saw the gayest guy on Earth.  I just saw the gayest guy on Earth.  I just saw the gayest guy on Earth. 
[03:02:30]  His best friend is Joe Barney.  I just saw the gayest guy on Earth.  I just saw the gayest guy on Earth.  I just saw the gayest guy on Earth.  He's got a red girl, I just saw  He wants foundry music  That's how you executive produce  He wears a terrible ice cream  He wears a special CD t-shirt  He drives a high blue card  I just saw  The gayest guy  I just saw  The gayest guy  He puts a foundry logo on everything 
[03:03:00]  I just saw  His shirts are too small.  His stomach is stretching.  He's a big boy.  He's shaved his arms.  It's just enough in capital letters.  My ears are bleeding.  We get it.  Stop it.  You saw the case.  This sucks.  All right, let's listen to the promos from Stephen S. from Bayshore for ONARadio.com. 
[03:03:30]  Hello, love.  Steve from Bayshore with you.  Be sure to check out the Opie and Anthony rundown at ONARadio.com.  Sleavy ass FM.  That's just bad.  It's not horrible.  Come on.  He doesn't even say a word and he jumped on it.  That's brilliant.  You fucking just chewed it apart but said it's not terrible.  It's all right.  Yeah, it's a thing. 
[03:04:00]  CBS.  It's supposed to be a crappy CBS type promo with bad music in the background.  Thanks, Jim.  Eat your tuna.  Eat your tuna.  Poor guy is almost homeless and now we're beating him up for his promos.  Who's almost homeless?  Stephen S.  I got to buy him beers at FH Riley's all the time.  Why, dude?  Because he doesn't have money.  Dude, you look like you have some shit.  He used to have some shit.  The economy's bad.  Yeah, the economy's bad.  Looks like he's got a groomsman.  Are you single? 
[03:04:30]  You got a family?  Divorced.  So you don't have kids or nothing?  No, I don't.  I got cats.  I got cats, yeah.  You got cats?  You got nobody?  Nobody I have to support.  No.  Oh, so you're all right.  You're fine.  But the economy is affecting people like Stephen S.  How, how?  I told him I'm a carpenter and it's very slow.  This is the face of our economy.  Yes.  No one's spending money there, Bobby, and he's going broke because of it.  So buy him beers at FH Riley's.  Thanks.  I'll pump up my brother's business.  What about some books?  Huh?  Oh, that'd be nice.  I get it. 
[03:05:00]  The world needs ditch diggers too, you know.  Oh, Stephen S. did more than one promo.  Oh, yes, I did.  I made four.  Oh, wow.  Achtung, Achtung.  This is Steve from Bayshore.  Be sure to check out the Opie and Anthony rundown at OANARadio.com.  You have your orders.  Now follow them.  Pretty Nazi.  I think that's cute.  I like that.  Better production than we're used to.  It's true.  But it's not right.  If you, you know, you know Steve? 
[03:05:30]  Mm-hmm.  He's into the era.  He's also into the era.  Interesting to me.  Should I like?  I didn't mean he was rolling his R's like a Puerto Rican more so than a German.  Well, I may tell you, one did mention Hercomia.  Oh.  But in a nice way.  Well, I hope so.  Well, sort of.  Want the next one or?  Oops.  Hello, everyone.  This is Martini Steve from Bayshore.  Be sure to check out the Opie and Anthony rundown at OANARadio.com. 
[03:06:00]  God forbid I should flag my own site.  Perhaps I should go work in a foundry somewhere.  That's a great George Takai.  You like that?  Yeah.  I can't get the Steve, the precise diction.  Because you need your body in it, too.  I think so.  And the last one.  Oh, the last one's another German one for you.  This is Steve from Bayshore, Minister of Propaganda for the new Kumia regime. 
[03:06:30]  I like that.  Be sure to check out the Opie and Anthony rundown at OANARadio.com.  You have your orders.  Now follow them.  See?  You like that ending.  I think it's cute.  It's cute.  I mean, any time you get a Nazi voice on the air, it's adorable.  It brings people together.  I think that's going to get flung against something.  I'm just waiting to hear it.  Oh, my God.  Opie takes it out.  He's just like...  I know this gentleman.  Exactly.  Opie, I swear to you.  Opie was putting it back in the case. 
[03:07:00]  Yes.  And I could usually see it coming a mile away.  And I saw no sign whatsoever that Opie was going to do anything.  And now I can't.  He wants to actually shred it in the case.  I like to do the unexpected.  I can't do it if you're expecting it.  Sam was going to leave it.  It's not that bad, actually.  It's fine.  Yeah.  You want to do production for our show?  Sure.  What the hell?  Sure.  You got to take a break?  All right.  You got to take a break.  Robert Kelly, where are you going to be?  Big plug.  Yeah.

[03:08:00]  Opie and Anthony on your radio.  What is going on over there?  I don't know.  Bobby's trying to touch Jimmy's chin.  And Jimmy...  Makes a noise and a really funny face.  Oh, God. 
[03:08:30]  Breaking news.  Oh, my God.  Bobby, look.  Oh, no.  Wow.  That guy is taking it.  Holy shit.  What, Bobby?  He has a vagina for an ass.  That's right.  Lucky.  Wait, what is that?  It's called Gaping Hole.  Wait, but what...  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  I'm a little puzzled.  How do you fucking stick that in your ass?  How do you not, Bob?  It's on every screen.  Is that his...  Ah!  Jesus.  What?  What's wrong, Bob?  Look.  Because it looks like he's got another asshole above that one, but... 
[03:09:00]  He looks like he has an old lady cunt.  Yeah.  Wow.  He has ravaged that thing.  Look at that.  Fuck.  It's all fucking beaten up and brown skin.  All right.  Can we just...  You know how bad that must smell?  Ah!  Oh, God.  Oh, he's wiping it with the sheet.  Look at that fucking orangutan asshole.  Oh, fuck.  All right, time out.  Oh, fuck.  Fucking that asshole, Curtis Sliwa, is just bashing you guys on his show.  Can we get that audio? 
[03:09:30]  Curtis Sliwa was just bashing you guys on his show for the assault on the media where the  newscaster got in trouble for cursing at the pest, yelling in the background.  Can we try to find that?  I guess it just went down.  Thank you to...  Opie and Dopey.  The truth.  Yeah.  From Wackback.  Thank you.  And also, Tim H. from Columbus, Ohio writes this.  Only on XM can you hear guys talking about eating cum and then hear a commercial for  XM Kids and how to help the children's hospital.  What the fuck?  You think the woman takes listening to this channel care about dying kids? 
[03:10:00]  One is the answer for the other, by the way.  That's exactly like that.  Oh, shit.  Chew some cum and raise some money.  Not a fucking swim walk.  No, that's more like a...  Yeah, okay.  Swim walk.  But you don't swim walk anymore.  I'm tired, man.  I fucking...  My nose is ruining my life.  I got to get my sinuses fixed.  Let's say hi to Robert on Long Island.  Robert.  Hi, Robert.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Good, Robert.  You're a pool dude.  Yeah, I just wanted to give Ant some information based on what he was talking about.  A salt generator system is the same as chlorine. 
[03:10:30]  It just uses a different medium to make the chlorine.  Right.  It takes, you know, sodium and chloride, and it uses the CL part of N-A-C-L.  Yes, Professor.  Does it taste like chlorine pool, or does it taste like just water?  Tastes like whipped cream, Bob.  What do you think?  I'm coming over.  It tastes like chlorine.  I'm coming over.  It's sparkly clean.  I've been in them salt pools before, and the motherfuckers is better. 
[03:11:00]  Anthony.  Yes, sir.  Hey, also, if you wanted to get totally away from chlorine, they do make a system that  uses just minerals.  I don't want to get too bored.  But why would you want to get away from chlorine?  Exactly.  Love chlorine.  Yeah, Anthony likes to ruin the environment.  The whole feel of the pool.  It is a carcinogen.  What, chlorine?  Yes.  Oh, everybody that's been in a pool gets cancer.  They should only get cancer.  No, no, no.  You should get cancer.  Someone that I used to caddy for died because they mixed the chemicals wrong and breathed 
[03:11:30]  in the toxic fumes and died almost instantly.  I want to go with a chlorine ammonia system.  See?  Only us chemists know that.  That's fatal.  Some Zyklon being your first.  Yes, of course.  Throw some lye.  God, marine biology and chemistry today.  And a little chemistry.  I dabble in a little bit of everything.  Do you have to go...  I'm sorry.  If you wanted to check it out, you can go online.  It's called EcoSmart.  Yes.  If you wanted to check it out, it's a no...  It doesn't use any chlorine and it's all automated as well. 
[03:12:00]  I don't care about being EcoSmart, my friend.  My carbon footprint on this planet, I'm going to leave...  It's going to be there forever.  Robert?  Yes.  You made it to the Opie and Anthony show, so why wouldn't you promote your business?  Because I was just...  I'm more looking up for Anthony.  It was humble.  Yeah, but why don't you get a little plug-in for yourself?  It's all about yourself.  Do it.  Are you sure?  Yeah, do it.  Do it.  No, no.  You see, I've been listening to the show long enough.  I know I'm going to get the clicks.  Well, now I can't do it.  Wow, yeah.  See, you identified it.  So now you get the plug.  You ruined it.  Now you get the plug.  I'm a huge fan, so... 
[03:12:30]  Go ahead, Robert.  I'm not going to tell you what the best part of the show is or anything like that.  What's your favorite part of the Opie and Anthony program?  Robert, I'm going to surprise you and a lot of people today.  Yeah?  Do your plug.  Nope.  Not going to happen.  But if you're listening, let me tell you something.  If you were a big enough fan, you would realize that when Opie says this, the surprise is  done and he would allow it because he's not going to do what everyone expects him to do.  So you would actually be able to get the plug out. 
[03:13:00]  Okay.  Either way, I'll go with the bit.  If it's a bit.  If it's not, I'll get my plug out.  You got it.  But it's not.  You're ungettable.  Either way, the name of the company is Signature Spa Service.  He delayed a little and waited until you have a click so he wouldn't be a fool.  Somewhere in there, he went, holy shit, I'm going to get my plug out here.  But Opie, you laughed over it.  Dude, Opie laughed over it.  What is it?  Opie laughed over it.  What is the name of the company?  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  Not going to happen. 
[03:13:30]  See, he does listen.  I'm actually trying to help him.  We heard it.  No, I didn't hear it.  All right.  I didn't hear it.  I didn't hear it either.  I heard Signature something and then Opie laughed.  That's all right, guys.  What is it?  Thank you, Robert.  I appreciate it anyway.  I was more looking out for it.  No, you got your plug in.  Thank you, Robert.  Anthony.  Now we got the people that say, don't use chlorine.  Use only chlorine.  Do this.  Do that.  Robert?  Yeah.  We're going to invite you to the cuddle party.  Ooh.  There you go.  That's right.  You got an invite, my friend.  Thank you, boys. 
[03:14:00]  Are we doing our cuddle party?  Right now.  He just looked at me and his eyebrows went up like a Muppet.  You want to do a puppy pile-up?  A puppy pile.  What's a puppy pile-up?  That's at the end of a cuddle party.  You have a puppy pile where you all get together and just pile on top of each other and hug  and kind of rub.  You got to get a big guy on the bottom that's able to hold it.  Okay, I'll do it.  We all going to be in feisty pajamas?  Yeah.  I'll wear fucking silk pajamas and take a Cialis so you can see the fucking helmet outline.  All right.  This is impossible. 
[03:14:30]  No absorption.  It just drips right down to your ankle.  Oh, it's fucking awful.  It's like a racing stripe down the front of my leg.  It looks like he was eating garlic and oil pasta.  Garlic?  Garlic.  Garlic.  Fucking Boston thing comes through every so often, doesn't it, Bobby?  Garlic.  You got to go to a cuddle party.  You actually go there with pajamas.  Yeah.  And you cuddle and hug and nuzzle with complete strangers, but it's not sexual.  Are there any midgets?  And they expect guys to get boners.  And if they get boners, that's okay. 
[03:15:00]  Really?  People are not supposed to freak out, but it's not sexual.  That's great.  Not sexual?  That's like eating a piece of cake and saying it's not good, says Regular Joe.  Hey, Regular Joe was on the show today.  Regular Joe.  Regular.  Wow.  He is a regular guy.  Just like an everyman.  Puffy McScrote writes, a cuddle party with a fat pool guy and a serial killer with bad  breath.  Oh boy, where do I sign up? 
[03:15:30]  Wait, fuck.  I'm a fucking mess, so I guess I fit in.  I don't know if this is true, but let's go with it.  Andy S. from Tennessee.  Hey, Opie, have you guys seen the latest sex scene that Heather Graham did?  Doggy style and getting spanked, my friends.  Heather Graham is hot.  I thought Little Jimmy might enjoy it.  It's www.the...  I copied and pasted.  Oh. 
[03:16:00]  God damn.  Dan was born at night, but he wasn't born last night.  Yay.  Who said that?  Regular Joe.  Oh, Regular Joe said that.  I couldn't quite see who said that.  A little levity.  You know, Heather Graham did a scene with Robbie Downey Jr. and was it Two Girls and  a Guy, where he eats her ass.  Eats her asshole out.  That's nice.  Might get a fucking instant boner in the movie theater.  She was in here once.  She pushes her against the wall, picks her skirt up, and buries his face in her asshole.  Oof.  God.  Would you smell her ass?  Yeah, I'd smell her ass. 
[03:16:30]  I'd smell your ass.  You have.  I know.  Dude, somebody in the studio had sex with Heather Graham.  You're out of your fucking mind.  All right.  Believe what you have to do.  And right now, in this studio?  Right now.  In this studio.  Someone right here.  Mm-hmm.  You got the scene?  Hang on.  Let me look.  It's a load.  Let me look at Anthony's face.  What?  What?  I didn't do anything.  Don't even.  Look at me.  Look at me.  Anthony, look at me.  What?  Did you fuck him right here? 
[03:17:00]  Look at me.  No.  I saw the Anthony charm in action yesterday.  What?  Really?  Was he C-Kyle and somebody?  All I'm going to say is, Ant and I had to do a little hanging out yesterday afternoon.  Why?  And I saw somebody giving Anthony the googie eyes.  Really?  I wasn't doing anything.  I didn't say you did anything.  Eva Braun.  Eva Braun.  But I saw it in action.  The girl was fawning over our pal, Anthony. 
[03:17:30]  That'll happen.  Anthony had his confident eyes.  I didn't say you did anything.  You didn't do anything.  But there was a professional.  There was definitely some chemistry happening with her.  I'm a professional.  Oh.  All right.  It was a working environment.  We got it?  I don't shit where I eat.  You're a professional cunt buster.  You should have said that, Regular Joe.  I'm sorry.  Well, you know.  Don't shit where you eat.  You don't shit where you eat.  You better go shit in your ass, says Regular Joe.  Regular Joe. 
[03:18:00]  A little levity.  A little levity.  It's always good.  Well, the video is really slow, but we're trying to get it.  Somebody really didn't fuck Heather Graham in this studio.  You fucking want me, right?  He's so fucking now taken with that.  I'd love to hear that story.  No, it's not Opie.  There's two pictures of it?  You can see the two pictures.  All right.  Damn, man.  I guess she gave up on regular Hollywood roles, huh?  Would you give her a good slamming in her vag from the back?  Yeah.  I'd actually pull some of it.  Would I?  I would pull some of her pussy out, outside of her pussy, like some of the innard pussy. 
[03:18:30]  I'd try to pull it out and then lick it and blow fresh air on it.  What the fuck?  What is that?  It's like a pink sock for a cunt.  Yeah.  I'm trying to think of how to say that on Free FM.  I don't want to do that.  You don't want to do that.  All right.  Well, are we giving up on...  Wow.  What happened?  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  Ew.  Oh, and now it freezes.  Of course, it does buffering.  Is that Robert Downey Jr.?  Hilarious.  Wow.  Her whole body's like a wave.  You put fucking a guy sticking a dildo bat in his ass on every screen in the fucking 
[03:19:00]  room.  Her, she's on one TV screen.  The size of a post-it stamp.  Yeah.  Could you fucking hook it up?  That is true, fucking Thanikins.  How about putting it on some more so we can all get our cocks hard?  All right.  Someone can get fed.  She looks like a good fuck if she fucks like that in the movies.  Oh, man.  Well, you should ask the person in the studio that had sex with Heather Grant.  Who's that little Dominican guy fucking her?  With Mark Anthony.  What the fuck is that?  He's slapping her ass, too.  Ooh, you fucking like that? 
[03:19:30]  You're so dirty.  You're cross-racial.  I don't like that.  It looks like, yeah.  I don't like this movie anymore.  Why?  Well, who is he?  Who cares?  What the fuck is that guy?  Stop being racist.  I'm not being racist.  I don't fucking...  He looks like a jockey.  That's right.  Little motherfucker.  He is.  He's riding her.  Hopefully, she'll break her fucking front hands like eight bells.  Her front hands.  Her front hands.  Her front hands.  Her front hands.  Oh, yeah.  Her front hands.  She's silly.  She's only got two. 
[03:20:00]  They're requesting more Dirty Potter.  I don't know if we have any more.  She does do a good back wave.  I would stick it like that.  Shit her.  How do you fake that, though?  I'd fight with a log.  How do you put a sock on and fake that scene?  It's like a little Neanderthal man fucking her.  I hate that.  Uh-oh.  Oh, she's getting mad, too.  What's the audio?  It's like, come on, fuck me, you little Puerto Rican.  Previews, what you'll want.  Letters of...  Yeah.  Maybe we should have the audio the whole time.  Yeah.  Play it again.  Start over. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah, start over.  Don't ruin it.  Come on, I got a fucking rod.  Whatever happened today to today's boner sponsored by?  We gotta bring that bit back.  If Steve's listening today.  Look at those tits.  All right, here's the, uh...  You're a fucking ass.  Oh, look at that fucking...  Look at where your back buckles.  Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.  Did you hear me?  No.  Hit me.  Hit her.  I can't do that.  Yes, you can.  Hit me. 
[03:21:00]  Hit me, Simon.  Uh-oh.  Are they playing poker?  Hurt her.  Black Jack shit.  Whatever.  That would have been really funny.  Tell me I'm a bad buck.  How many times has that happened to me?  What the fuck?  Oh, what a downer. 
[03:21:30]  Not really.  He fucking hits her until she starts crying?  That's an upper.  Downer.  What is that?  I'm not going to finish better if he had a fucking...  Yeah.  If he had an anvil.  Oh, that's fantastic.  Did you say tell me I'm a bad mother?  Yeah.  I like that.  Like, what was that about?  I don't know.  I hope she's a foster mom and she adopted him.  Maybe.  Now he's fucking her.  Jesus.  Hit me.  Look, I used to hit you.  She starts crying.  Oh, right.  Look at how he's getting into it.  Go eat some cum and calm down.  Did we get the Curtis audio yet? 
[03:22:00]  They're looking.  All right, they're looking.  Hey, we got...  Remember that Bill O'Reilly thing we played the other day?  Yes.  Yes.  Got to give a plug to Revolution, I guess.  They played this on Rana Fez Noon 2-3.  And...  Ah-ha!  God bless you, Opie.  God bless you, Opie.  And someone made some kind of remix out of the Bill O'Reilly audio.  Five, four, three.  Fuck it.  There's no words on it.  That's tomorrow.  Fuck it.  We'll do it live. 
[03:22:30]  Fuck it.  Because I've never seen that.  Fucking things suck.  There's no words there.  Fuck it.  There's no words on it.  That's tomorrow.  Fuck it.  We'll do it live.  Fuck it.  Because I've never seen that.  Fucking things suck.  There's no words there.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Fuck it.  I don't know.  Go, go.  I can't do it.  Fuck it.  Go, go.  I can't do it.  Fuck.  Fuck it.  Go, go.  I can't do it.  Fuck it.  Go, go.  I can't do it.  Fuck, fuck, fuck.  Thanks again for watching, fuck it 
[03:23:00]  There's no, there's no words on it  Tomorrow  Fuck it  We'll do it live  Fuck it  I've never seen that  Fucking things suck  There's no words there  Fuck it  There's no, there's no words on it  Tomorrow  Fuck it  We'll do it live  Fuck it  I've never seen that  Fuck it  Fucking things suck  There's no words there  Okay, ready?  Take it away  Go, go, yeah  Go, go, yeah  Go, go, yeah  Fuck it, fuck it  We'll do it live  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. 
[03:23:30]  Listen to me to play us out.  To end the show.  Hey, that's pretty good.  Hey, going back to the Heather Graham thing, we went on way too fast. 
[03:24:00]  Bobby D. writes from Brockton, what's the name of the movie that that's in?  Do we know?  A Drift in Manhattan.  All right.  Damian Thomas writes, hit me are the hottest words ever.  Damian also writes, bad mother, can this get any better?  Yeah, hit me.  Lauren from New Jersey writes, Heather Graham's asshole, great with five-hour energy drink.  Oh, yeah.  We got Dan in New York City, you got me hard and I'm driving a garbage truck with the door open.  Take one of the dead bodies out of the back and fuck it. 
[03:24:30]  Sounds like she has daddy issues.  That's hot.  Theron.  I like that.  Here's what I look for when I meet a woman.  I'm like, so how's your dad?  I haven't talked to him.  Let's go out.  Okay, fine.  I'm estranged.  Have you ever had a girl tell you issues about, like, she's been raped by her father or somebody  in the family?  The voice.  Did you hear his voice all of a sudden gets like that?  Yeah.  You ever have a girl tell you?  I did actually years ago.  But you're going to go home, dude.  You're going to go home. 
[03:25:00]  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Let's get it.  I've had that.  No, you haven't.  Did you go through with it?  Yes.  And there was one who used to tell me.  Me too.  Was it a fantasy or was she actually fessing up to this?  That one girl told me her father used to, not the person you're thinking of, used to  make her suck his cock.  And I would forget exactly what it was, but then she leaned over and stuck my cock in the  car.  That's fucked up.  Fucked up?  Tell that to my dick.  All right.  Introduce me. 
[03:25:30]  Anthony, I would like you to meet Jim Norton's dick.  Pleasure.  Oh, I shook hands and it spit at me.  He's very rude.  I had that, too.  So I had a girl, I had a girl after an AA meeting, we were sitting in the parking lot  and she.  Nice.  Good.  Nice and vulnerable.  Good.  She started crying and telling her, we could kiss in and blah, blah, blah.  And then I took, I used to have, I just used to take my conk out.  My conk.  See, that's what you do.  Take my conk out.  I told her there was scotch in it. 
[03:26:00]  I said, come over here.  And I, and she got up, she started crying.  She got molested by her dad.  And recently, like up until, you know.  The day before?  It's not molesting if you have to drive over to his house.  Cut to 20 minutes later, her calling me her dad.  And I'm like, you've been a bad girl, baby.  See, that is so completely fucked up.  Again, tell it to Jimmy's cock.  Yeah.  Tell it to my cock.  Look, he's rubbing his dick, right? 
[03:26:30]  You don't rub your dick during these stories.  You don't not.  What are you, gay?  It's just an odd, um.  Something hot about it, dude.  Thing that isn't quite hot.  It's just really sick and twisted.  Yeah, but picture a girl who was molested.  And then all of a sudden, because she's going, daddy, daddy.  Yeah, what's up, baby?  Yeah, but the fact that she's doing that is fucked up.  Fucked up for who?  Because I'd just be thinking, holy shit.  Like, she shouldn't be thinking this is hot.  Oh, my God. 
[03:27:00]  Why?  I don't know.  Because it's not hot.  Isn't that tragic?  My cock jumped up like a marine at 6 a.m.  It's kind of creepy.  It was almost like someone was banging a garbage can.  It's kind of creepy.  Look, I'm just playing the devil's advocate.  Fuck, I'm hard right now thinking about it.  Steven S., what about you?  It's a little disturbing, but I could see the appeal.  Definitely.  Oh, my God.  If you smell anything really bad in the next 30 seconds, I had five consecutive fart bubbles 
[03:27:30]  that just kind of bubbled out of my anus.  I don't want any fucking ass gas over here.  Speaking of five, five-hour energy.  I have to take a quick announcement, too, because I sent out a MySpace blog, a MySpace thing that was incorrect.  What happened, Jimmy?  A bulletin, yes.  I was supposed to blog on ifc.com.  I was going to do four blogs for them, and I did one.  And I did a second one, and they want me to sign this contract or something.  There's no money for it.  Right.  But they want me to sign this contract.  So I'm like, fuck you. 
[03:28:00]  It really annoyed me.  I'm not signing your dumb contract.  Right.  You're not going to own this.  I'm putting it up.  A bunch of people are doing blogs for them.  Right.  But it's just more corporate fucking idiots.  So ifc.com, if you went there, I apologize, but I will not be blogging, because they want  a contract, and I'm not signing one.  Why do they want a contract?  Fuck that.  Who the fuck knows?  It's free.  I'm going to sign something over to you for fucking free?  So irritating.  Everybody's a fucking lawyer now.  Yeah.  A five-page fucking contract. 
[03:28:30]  Assholes.  Awkward.  Wow.  He's an awkward.  Fuck them.  Awkward.  IFC.com.  You're not exactly fucking drudge.  All right.  Gary Coleman in divorce court.  It's like, what the fuck?  It's free.  What'd you tell them?  You just tell them to go fuck themselves?  Absolutely.  I'm not signing anything.  No.  I'd take the iPhone one down.  Fuck that.  Wow.  Why are you making them take it down?  Oh.  That's a good reason.  We got Gary Coleman in divorce court, or a light bulb that has burned for $160. 
[03:29:00]  Seven years.  I got to get a light bulb one.  Why?  Filament.  It must have very good filament.  Who's that?  Filament.  Who's that?  It's me.  I'm hoping.  Who's you?  Who is that?  Who is that?  Ted, the light bulb expert.  Who?  Filament is very effective.  You're an expert on what?  Light bulbs.  Really?  Yes.  Companies hire me to save them energy. 
[03:29:30]  What if I wanted to save energy in my apartment?  Would you sound like wizardry?  Would I change the light bulb?  Or would I change them to?  Stop trying to lead me, idiot.  He can do it himself.  Fucking Jimmy had a rant on trees yesterday.  It was legendary.  The stupid tree bit yesterday.  Made me live all day.  I'm hoping for a light bulb rant today.  You never know.  There won't be one.  I was just commenting on the Philippines.  Light bulb burns continuously for 107 years. 
[03:30:00]  That's a lot longer than normal.  We got to thank Breach.  Normally they tap out at 103 years.  But after four years, he got his money's worth.  Is this Frank the Frowner?  No, it's Ted, the light bulb expert.  Sounds a lot like Frank the Frowner.  Yes, they all sound alike.  Don't you understand that?  There's two voices, eight people.  Uh, Breedbart. 
[03:30:30]  Thanks to Breedbart for bringing us on their, uh...  Breedbart!  On their, uh, main page.  Here we go.  The Centennial Lightbulb here at the Livermore Pleasant Fire Department is a hand-blown light bulb  built by the Shelby Light Company with a carbon filament inside.  I told you it was a good filament, but nobody wants to listen to me.  The Shelby Light Company was legendary for their filaments.  It sounds like there might have been some wizardry to this light bulb. 
[03:31:00]  There wasn't no wizardry, it was just good filament stuff.  I think you know a little bit about wizardry, don't you?  It sounds like you could.  Frank the Frowner.  Huh?  There's a filament inside, and it puts out four watts worth of light.  We currently use it to illuminate the apparatus.  It's like Voss.  A little dim bulb.  A little soft orange glow coming out of it.  It's 104 years old. 
[03:31:30]  107!  I didn't even think of that either.  107.  Got tiny little filaments.  Nothing beats Jimmy's Ben Franklin cruising rant.  Damien wants to acknowledge that rant.  Yeah, that was a good one.  To illuminate the apparatus bay, and the firefighters use it at night as the night light when they're  coming out to get into their rigs from the dormitory.  Our light bulb is 108 years old.  It was first installed in 1901 in the carriage house for the fire department on Wood Street  in Livermore.  The light bulb has been here through a lot of historical events. 
[03:32:00]  It was shining before the Wright Brothers flew.  It was shining before man stepped on the moon.  And it's been shining through a number of walls.  A few things happen in between there.  Yeah.  When you look at the light bulb, you'll notice that not only is the light bulb the original  part of the installation, but everything from the ceiling to the light bulb.  So the wire, the socket, and the base, including the switch, is all original.  So it's a fire hazard.  That's pretty much what he's saying.  Do you know how great that would look with a basketball bouncing off of it?  170 years down, the fucking shitter.  Smash!  Get me a new one. 
[03:32:30]  Dude, where's the light bulb?  Send a pest.  Yes, we got a prize deposit.  Break that fucking asshole light bulb.  Break the light bulb.  Oh my God.  Next day, there's just a GE 100 water screwed into there.  Exactly.  History's gone.  Yeah, where happened to the light bulb?  Oh, this one's brighter.  Shut up.  Fucking broke.  One of the things to note is, is the filament of the bulb is much larger than the common filaments  we have right now.  As I've said!  Yeah, what was he saying about the filament? 
[03:33:00]  Because you could probably just finish what he was saying.  The filament is much larger, therefore more effective.  Oh my God.  Is that right, Frank DeFran?  Huh?  I'm Ted the light bulb expert.  Light bulb expert.  Right now.  So it's much more shock sensitive.  And it doesn't put out as much light, but it certainly puts out enough illumination and  has kept going for over 100 years.  Exactly.  What does that mean, shock sensitive?  Because you don't want to get shocked, you'll become sensitive. 
[03:33:30]  Idiot.  It means if you tap it, it won't break like your normal light bulb.  Exactly.  It's a big, fat, thick, black filament.  Yeah.  Big, thick filament.  You don't want to put that anywhere near the blonde filament, or it'll never come back.  The blonde filament will be ruined.  She'll start smoking Newports.  She'll put on 100 pounds.  Now, boardroom Jimmy, this can't be good for the economy, right?  To have a light bulb that burns for 107 years. 
[03:34:00]  I don't know enough about numbers, so I deal in filaments.  My company puts out seven filaments a year.  Seven a year?  That's right.  Well, I guess if they last forever.  That's not quality.  We make them from the spines of stillborns.  I love how he has to be in character, even though it's radio.  You can't even see his eyes.  It's just who I am.  He's just fucking a mess. 
[03:34:30]  Eight years.  People always ask us, has it ever been hit, or do you dust it, or how do you take care of it?  What is your answer to that, sir?  In a matter of...  Has it ever been hit?  By what?  It's fucking still intact, isn't it?  Yes, it was hit by a child's party balloon in 1937.  And a dust bunny crashed into it.  It was hit by a breeze, it would explode, you cunt. 
[03:35:00]  Who asks you these questions?  Oh, shit.  People always ask, has anybody ever kicked it like a judo expert?  Have a fire truck ever run it over?  Has it ever exploded and been taped back together?  Or clean it.  And the matter of fact is, is that on occasion, the light bulb has been hit with basketballs  and Nerf balls and a few things, and it has sustained itself quite well. 
[03:35:30]  Well.  They've asked us, so what are you going to do when the light bulb burns out?  And we affectionately tell them that we don't plan to do anything, because we know this  light bulb is probably going to outlive most of us here today.  Eight years ago, the light bulb celebrated.  What are you going to do when the light bulb burns out?  Will it just be dark forever in here?  Or will you replace it?  What are you going to read by?  Eight years ago, the light bulb celebrated its 100th birthday, and we threw a barbecue 
[03:36:00]  here, and that was attended by approximately 500 people, complete with cake and the barbecue.  This light bulb has its own website, and you can visit that website, centenniallightbulb.com,  and watch the light bulb on its own light cam, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  So the light bulb by itself is, if you will, its own personality, it's definitely its own  character, and a part of Livermore that is truly, truly historical.  www.breakthisalready.com  That's the light bulb? 
[03:36:30]  Wow.  Oh, it looks like an old man.  Oh.  That old man is pointing at the light bulb.  What's the LFD?  That's the town.  Something fucking dummy.  Light fucking dummy.  Put that picture back, Nathaniel, or I'll knock that hat off.  Take your fucking head.  He goes, he's from the Livermore Fire Department, I believe, uh, Ted.  Ted, right?  Ted, the light bulb expert.  The light bulb expert.  He looks like the gorgeous fisherman.  He does. 
[03:37:00]  And all he's doing is using the light to show you the finger he fucked his wife with last night.  He's showing you his stinky finger.  He's like, that's how far I got it in before she passed out.  I'm a fat-fingered fisherman.  God damn it.  Oh, he's a thick-fingered man.  He certainly is.  What kind of filament is that?  That's a very thick filament.  It's the type they used to make out of carbon. 
[03:37:30]  Now they switch them.  They make them out of kerosene.  They're not as effective.  Carrots.  You turn it on and they explode.  It's like the light bulb that killed Caretaker.  At least that was the one in your house.  The light bulb looks like an old man's sack.  Yeah, it's just kind of hanging there and it smells bad.  That's all I can come up with.  It really does.  It looks like a ball bag.  I'm licking light bulb.  But the socket and everything is supposed to be the same age.  It's the original, they said.  I'm sorry, Ted.  Ted, it looks newer, though. 
[03:38:00]  It's not newer.  Okay, I apologize.  How do you turn it on?  Just twist it?  You look at it and it knows what to do.  Stupid as a switch.  So that's my question.  How do you turn it on?  Rub your cock in front of it.  It'll get excited.  Talk dirty to it.  I'm just asking.  What's your name again?  You know my name.  Ted, the light bulb expert.  Could be the worst character ever.  Yeah, well, it's factual.  Always. 
[03:38:30]  I know all about filaments.  I certainly think I see him as a one-off.  Oh, you're going to be surprised.  A lot of light bulb news.  Oh, more than you can imagine.  As a matter of fact, every story has a light bulb in it somehow.  Because there's always light involved.  You can tell us what type of lighting was used.  Yeah, of course I will.  Yeah.  Fluorescent.  Fluorescent for queers.  Okay.  It's running the filament business.  Will you take questions from our listeners, Ted? 
[03:39:00]  If there are serious questions, I don't play games with light bulbs.  All right, Brad in Jersey.  Good evening, Brad.  Thank you for calling the program.  No, it's on.  It's a feedback.  Ted's light bulb hour.  It's an hour.  Jesus.  He wants to know how many Jews does it take to screw in a light bulb.  I don't do jokes like that.  Six million.  Oh, fuck this shit. 
[03:39:30]  I never thought we'd have a light bulb expert on it.  Of course you haven't.  We got instant feedback from Stephen S. from Bayshore.  Hey.  What am I?  Oh, how could that be?  He's sitting right here.  But it says Stephen S. from Bayshore.  Someone's lying.  Someone's.  Who?  Fidbin.  What?  Line of the Day is brought to you by Ted, the light bulb expert.  Yes, it certainly is.  By one of his seven filaments he makes a year.  That's right.  They last a long time.  They're from stillborn spines.  If you make it only.  Oh, that's right.  He did say that.  But he only makes seven a year. 
[03:40:00]  Why not make more?  Because I get tired of shoveling.  Shoveling?  That's why everybody walks away crying.  Oh, God.  Oh, shit.  Dude, I've got so many splinters.  Prying those little lids off.  Oh, fuck. 
[03:40:30]  Tiny little lid.  Breaking news.  Breaking news.  Looks like it'd be nice to put a shaving cream cannon.  Oh, my God.  Instead of the dreams you had.  Oh, fuck.  Josh from Jersey writes,  I'm watching Maury's top ten sexiest moments,  and for some ungodly reason,  Stalker Patty was one of them.  Oh.  Well, she was on her show.  That's when a friend of hers got her makeover  to try and get her laid. 
[03:41:00]  So I put the little feather in the shoe box.  Oh, God damn.  Line of the Day brought to you by Cartscan.  Get all your contacts organized in just a few seconds.  Check out the device that nobody should be without.  That's right, a light bulb.  Everyone needs one.  No, no.  No, no.  Cartscan.  Oh.  Dot com slash radio one.  I'm going to use that to scan Ted's card.  He gave me one.  That's right.  Because I'm in need of a light bulb at my house.  I'm having a lot of work done, 
[03:41:30]  and I've got a chandelier going in,  and it's got a lot of light bulbs in it.  You bet it does.  I hear the word chandelier,  and I get tingly in the genitals.  Now, if you only make seven filaments a year,  though, that's going to be a problem for a chandelier.  No, it's not.  I've just been very slow on orders.  Nobody's ordering,  because I charge $500 per bowl for a handmaid.  I paint a little insignia on him.  Ted's a douche.  Ted's not a douche.  Ted's a self-made man. 
[03:42:00]  Ted's light bulb factory has been going strong for 14 months.  Wow.  Do you have a website?  What?  Do you have a website?  www.tezlightbulbfractory.com  There's four W's.  There's four W's.  There's four W's.  There's four W's.  Trevor from Akron, Ohio.  What's Ted's opinion of halogen light bulbs?  Huh?  Halogen.  I don't like halogen.  Why?  I don't know.  It's halogen.  Halogen is the ones you put in your headlamps. 
[03:42:30]  Yes, yes.  Yes, of course I know that.  Very bright.  Yes.  I prefer to put a regular 60-watt bulb in the front of the light.  In your headlights?  I certainly do.  That probably wouldn't throw off much light.  Keep some mosquitoes away from the car,  because they're always shitting on the hood.  I hate when moles and mosquitoes...  Mosquitoes or mosquitoes.  I hate mosquitoes.  Mosquito.  I hate mosquitoes.  What about LEDs? 
[03:43:00]  Those are...  Oh, yeah.  A lot of people are using those now.  I don't like those at all.  Light emitting tiles.  Oh, those are no good.  They find those in paint chips.  It's bad for children.  Here is a runner-up in line of the day.  I bet you Mr. Big's a pedo,  and he has to go upstate for a few years.  They found questionable photographs on his computer.  What about fluorescent lights?  Do you like them?  I answered that question already, redundant. 
[03:43:30]  I said I don't like them.  They're for queers.  I just wanted to hear you say it again.  Plus, you can hide a regular light bulb in your own hanging.  If you're going to do that with a fluorescent,  you have to get a good buddy and go cheek to cheek,  and then sashay sideways.  I'm going on that.  Sashay.  Yeah.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Call me.  I don't really believe in marriage.  Now, Botox, on the other hand,  that works every time.  Oh, that's Samantha. 
[03:44:00]  Oh, is she something?  How many pricks does this girl need?  Don't dump Botox.  You know, they use the needle.  They pricked you.  Oh, right.  I get you.  I've got to explain my joke before they dump out.  No Curtis audio.  No, we couldn't find it.  Maybe we had a liar.  You lied, Peewee.  On the answer to feedback today.  We'll find out.  We'll find it.  Another runner-up line of the day. 
[03:44:30]  Today, it's going to be called for some taped-on sunglasses.  Oh, God.  Half of my thigh placed on my cheek.  Oh, God.  What?  I've gone too far.  You can't keep it fun and light, can you?  I'm sorry.  They turn their head into the wind.  Whee!  Whee!  Whee!  Whee!  Whee!  Whee!  Whee!  Whee!  Whee!  That's terrible.  That's fucking brilliant. 
[03:45:00]  God.  That's terrible.  That was fucking funny.  That was today?  Yeah, I know.  That seems like days ago.  That seems like yesterday.  You know, skin around that fucking hole.  That fucking cesspool in the backyard thing on the side of the head.  That fucking sinkhole that used to be an ear.  Fucking turtle ears.  Really are like a fucking, just like a hairless reptile.  Put a wig on an iguana. 
[03:45:30]  Looks just like him.  Looks just like him.  Oh, those horrendous wigs.  Little tuft wig.  Whenever you see the wig on a burn victim, you want to go, oh, look at the wig.  And fucking just adjust it really roughly.  Well, I'll be very ginger with that if you don't mind.  My head is tender.  That's right.  It's the same character.  Apparently there's an accident in the filament factory.  It burns from head to tall.  Don't move the wig around too roughly.  My head is very tender.  Oh, shit. 
[03:46:00]  It's like hamburger patty.  Be gentle with the wig.  The final runner-up line of the day.  I want to play too.  All right, grab a stick.  He's a gym teacher.  Wave it.  He really is worthless.  Michael J. Fox's future job.  Too much.  But he can only do Flight of the Bumblebee.  Nice.  It's a bonus runner-up.  Oh, no.  What happened there?  Bonus runner-up.  Late entry.  Late entry. 
[03:46:30]  Something we heard a mere three minutes ago.  I'm sure.  I'm smelling Steve from Bayshore.  I'm washed.  One more runner-up line of the day.  Oh, regular Joe.  It's going to be a balmy 40.  So put a lot of sunblock on it.  It's going to be very windy, so make sure you dip your head in Vaseline.  Horrible.  Robert Kelly, the big gig.  Where is that again?  June 6th. 
[03:47:00]  Patrice O'Neal, Mike DiStefano.  And no Rich Voss for some reason.  No Rich Voss.  He's not on the gig.  But it's Red Bank, New Jersey.  Count Basie Theater.  Tickets are on sale now.  So make sure you call 732-842-9000.  Big show.  I think it's like a thousand-seat theater, too.  Are you calling it the mini-virus show?  No.  Somebody said you were.  No.  No, that's stupid Voss.  Oh, really?  Remember we wanted to do that little thing with me, him, and Voss?  That's a great idea, actually. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah, it's a great idea.  But then they booked this show with me, DiStefano, and Voss.  I mean, and Patrice.  But Voss, I don't know.  I don't get it.  That's a lovely theater to Count Basie.  That's a 300-bulber.  Is it really?  It's a 300-bulber.  He just pays attention to how many light bulbs are in a place.  But you only make seven.  Judge how good it is.  He only makes seven a year, though.  Yeah, that's the only one in the country, though.  There's other ones.  How many?  Competition.  I don't know.  Who's that?  Who's the club with a funny number? 
[03:48:00]  Two million.  Hee, hee, hee, hee.  He's that.  Well, who's your biggest competition there, Ted?  What's in the sun?  The sun is owned by Jews, and they want it shut down.  The Jews have the sword, and they're ruining my business.  My bad friend is Larry the Cloudmaker.  We're teaming up.  Larry makes clouds, and he blocks out the son of the Jew. 
[03:48:30]  God damn it.  Holy shit.  I'm in direct.  I really have a rivalry going with Roger the darkness salesman.  He hates me.  He sells darkness to rooms.  But when I turn on the light, I guess we got it, didn't we?  Yeah, we got it.  Or nothing worse than over-explaining a mediocre joke. 
[03:49:00]  What do you think, cum eater?  You're going to give yourself a headache.  Holy shit.  All right, here's your line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Has it ever been hit?  By what? 
[03:49:30]  It's fucking still intact, isn't it?  Yes, it was hit by a child's party balloon in 1937.  And a dust bunny crashed.  Poo.  Poo.  It's too short.  It's still too short, right?  Wow.  That was funny.  That was very funny.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  Thanks for stopping by.  Thanks for having me, gentlemen.  Yes, indeed.  I got to see.  Looking forward to reading the wonderful Jimmy-ness.  Yes.  Isn't it fun? 
[03:50:00]  That was great.  He actually makes the face and everything.  Well, you know, Ted.  I'm amazed by the amount of spittle that comes out of your mouth.  That's really brilliant.  Yes, spittle is the enemy of the light bulb.  It's very ironic that I'm such a light bulb king.  I have to talk away from my own products.  My monthly magazine explains how you do that.  Oh, monthly magazine.  What's that called?  Ted's Monthly Magazine Concerning Light Bulbs. 
[03:50:30]  What should I call it?  I don't like that every question I ask you, Ted.  You get fucking very offended.  Sorry.  Your head reminds me of one of my products.  Thank you.  They left me hanging in here, but you certainly didn't.  ONAradio.com for Stephen S. from Bayshore's show rundowns.  I guess that's it.  Yeah.  Let's get out of here.  Let's make my light bulb and switch off. 
[03:51:00]  Doesn't make much sense.  Sure does.  Amazing.  All right, guys.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Did you see that bodacious set of ta-tas?  Wow.  It's Whip'Em Out Wednesday. </pre>
