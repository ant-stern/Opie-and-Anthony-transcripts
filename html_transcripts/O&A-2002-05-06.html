<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a live commentary on a lengthy Los Angeles car chase unfolding on Fox News.  The hosts, fueled by excitement and punctuated by vulgar and offensive remarks, followed the chase's every twist and turn for over an hour and a half, speculating wildly about the suspect's motives and the police's strategy.  They interjected this with various tangents, including humorous imagined encounters between the suspect and a truck driver, and discussions about Jimmy Norton's cameo in *Spider-Man*, prompting caller accounts of audience reactions including shouts of "tinkle drinker" and "crinkle crinkle".  Rich Voss called in to discuss NBC's anniversary special and the XFL's failure, and Opie shared an uncomfortable personal anecdote.  The car chase finally concluded with the suspect's apprehension, prompting further crude commentary from the hosts and callers.

The show then transitioned to promoting their upcoming "O&A Money Snatch" game, a contest involving naked women grabbing cash.  They made numerous phone calls to recruit contestants, revealing a mysterious additional challenge involved.  A listener poll on foundrymusic.com simultaneously determined whether regular caller "Stalker Patty" should participate.  Patty's eviction was threatened due to her planned participation, leading to calls to her landlord and a police officer to discuss her legal rights.  The hosts also mentioned upcoming live shows in Philadelphia and Washington D.C., featuring contests with prizes like meeting Kid Rock or attending a Poison after-party.  The show also played audio clips from a training video for individuals with intellectual disabilities, which were about a wet dream and a son masturbating, prompting a discussion about politically correct terminology.  Patty ultimately agreed to participate in the Money Snatch game.

A contentious phone call with Kim, Patty’s roommate’s daughter, dominated a significant portion of the broadcast.  Kim vehemently argued against Patty's residency and right to live rent-free, launching into a barrage of insults against Patty. The hosts and their legal expert, Keith, joined the fray, engaging in similarly aggressive and insulting exchanges with Kim, targeting her weight, family, and sexual life.  The discussion veered into Patty’s financial situation, her relationship with Kim, and whether Kim claimed Patty on her taxes. The hosts' aggressive questioning about Kim's daughter and a son with a large head was also notable.  The conversation eventually circled back to the radio contest, culminating in the hosts offering Patty $906 to shave her head again as part of a "Let's Make a Deal" segment; Patty agreed.  The segment mentioned Sadie Allison and Alex Carroll as future guests and teased more clips from the "retard" video.

The show then focused on the impending shaving of Patty's head.  Patty, needing the money, planned to sleep on the studio couch. The hosts used a "battered wife" analogy to describe her situation, leading to a confusing aside about Joyce and breakfast.  They also mentioned past efforts to help Patty, including introducing her to people and fostering friendships.  Callers including several Pattys and Uncle John contributed to "What I Learned Today" segments with various anecdotes, some crude and offensive.  A surprise call from Steve-O of Jackass fame, who excitedly declared he was on a Special K bender and had a story to share, was cut short due to the show ending.  The hosts further teased segments involving the "retard" video, "sexpert" Alex Carroll, and further recruitment for the O&A Money Snatch game.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  uh we're so bummed we got to start the radio show right now i'm so pissed about this welcome to the  open anthony show we've been following a uh a car chase on fox you gotta love fox uh news channel  for the last uh half hour or so usually these car chases wrap up before we have to start our  program you notice these car chases always start around 2 30 and yeah and they wrap up nicely just  before we have to go on the air but this one continues in uh los angeles and uh california 
[00:00:30]  on the i-5 northbound north of los angeles this guy's got a geo metro with a smashed up front end  and he's flying he's doing like 90 he's got a few uh california highway patrol behind him  and it doesn't look like much traffic great day for driving out there in california hoping  and um he's just been going for for quite a while now and of course we uh we're hoping for 
[00:01:00]  not a peaceful pullover and arrest i want this car to cartwheel oh death and destruction times and  burst into flame i want to see his body fly out i love a good ending to these car chases they've  been very disappointing the last few we've seen you never get the good ending i know well you know  how it usually ends the guy maybe gets stuck in traffic he doesn't have enough balls to try to  plow through so he stops gets out and lays down on the cement with his hands behind his back thinking 
[00:01:30]  the cops are just going to cuff him that's funny when they come over and just jab the knee behind  his neck even though he's laying prone he's on the ground he thinks all right it's over now i just  get arrested they put the knee in the back of his neck pull his arm up because they're pissed that  they gotta you know drive around chasing the guy and this uh car chase has been going on for like  an hour and a half he got off the five and got back on the five so he was on an on-ramp yeah perfect  opportunity for the cop to bump the back uh bumper i don't know why they didn't take the chase would 
[00:02:00]  have been done well now the guy's got a smashed front end he the car isn't handling well so he tries  to change lanes every so often so they can't put the spike strip down and uh he's kind of weaving a  little bit it's kind of getting a little squirrely and how stupid uh do you have to be to to think  you could outrun this to outrun the cops and the three helicopters that are following you where you  going you're going nowhere the guy thinks it's like the bonnie and clyde days you know you just  get across the state line and uh yeah all i have to do is lose the cops and i'm home free no you got 
[00:02:30]  helicopters helicopters are following this guy and i like this one because this is a three camera shoot  anthony yeah they're really going all out they got a few news cameras uh on this guy  there's the cop chasing him they're showing showing the guy he's pretty much alone on this  stretch of road yeah he kind of sucks i like when there's a lot of traffic and then they try that  squeeze move you ever see when he get off the off-ramp and he tries to get on the shoulder and  that shoulder eventually runs out because the guardrail goes right onto the uh highway and he does that  just scrape everybody's car move i love that i like the people's reaction because you know they're 
[00:03:00]  just going hey hey hey what are you doing hey this is uh four lanes anthony  and no one on the road except for some uh 18 wheelers out there they should phone in give  them a little call to their good buddies on cb channel 19 and then uh they have them run them  off the road and they're talking about laying down like some kind of strip the spike strip  spike flatness tires and uh i guess the the problem they're having is they only put the spike strip on 
[00:03:30]  one lane this is i don't know what lane the guy's gonna of course you don't know what lane the guy's  gonna be and he's switching lanes like crazy they say well the guy is a changing lane so they can't  put the spike so they can't figure out which uh which lane to put the spike strip down four lane  highway get four spike strips you dopes put him down the guy flattens the tires and uh he doesn't go  anywhere it looks like he has one of those donut spare tires on the back too which uh really suck  yeah you ever you ever drive around on one of those for any length of time  i used to before i could afford tires opie i had to drive around on uh one of the donuts 
[00:04:00]  for a while that f is up your car and it's like you know don't exceed 55 miles an hour or 50 miles  an hour with a donut and you're doing like 90 just waiting for the thing to fly apart on you  i had this just in this is like monday night football we're getting we're getting fed in  information information late breaking uh these geo cars could get like 50 miles per gallon so uh he's  not stopping anytime soon he's not running out of gas anytime soon ah another guy saying that uh he  had one of these cars it's gonna flip he never went over 50 miles an hour with his or 60 with his 
[00:04:30]  because it would flip well this guy's going at least 90 at times  what we're dealing with here is a complete lack of respect for the law  go get him buford  long way to go in a short time to get there  he's got to bring that beer 
[00:05:00]  you gotta bring that coors beer back god damn bring it back to georgia  leave it to dan from hoboken he's saying he hopes some surly truck driver runs him off the road  come on norton how would you as a truck driver in the uh in the spider-man movie how would you handle  this he comes up on you you've just loaded up your boxes that were behind you 
[00:05:30]  probably just yell you stink for a half a second  right very quick you're on the screen  really fucker slash coward i would do nothing  that is an attention getter  could i have hush puppies daddy we ain't got time for that crap

[00:08:00]  that's it  i mean where's he going  he's uh well the cops are hoping he runs out of gas  but where is he going  that's the strategy  i'm going to my mother's house  millions of people are watching him right now  he's going nowhere  the helicopters  they're having no problem staying up  all i wanted to do was get to my mother's house  ah what they changed back  well fox is even getting bored  fox is like all right  fox likes their car chases wrapped up within 20-30 minutes  we'll tape it and uh we'll uh show it to you here on fox after he wrecks  i guess that's it 
[00:08:30]  uh i don't know  i don't have the audio  yeah i think they went to  oh they're going to heralda rivera  uh not really ship  i actually thought that i was going to run out of gas before that guy in the i-5  but uh no progress  the progress  in resolving this 35 day long stand up  has been just as painfully slow  just as frustrating  as peace negotiations usually are in this war-torn region  it only seems that you take two steps forward and almost uh at the same distance backward  but we are inching  they say inching to the elimination of the dangerous and violent confrontation 
[00:09:00]  in and around the place  with christmas  you're all making the funny  i'm here in bethlehem  ham-handed segue it won't do  isn't he horrible  i thought i was going to run out of gas  i'm being shot at oh wait no i'm not  the guy likes making it sound like he's in danger  after 2020 he really put his dignity in a septic tank  it never happened to him 
[00:09:30]  he used to be a great journalist  i know  awful mustachioed pr  what a letdown this car chase is  i know  i feel like i uh i just sat through a rich voss show  ouch  40 minutes of rambling into nothing  you know  barreling straight ahead no destination  there's cops behind me and i'm dodging  you know how foxes  they wanted uh they wanted to get right to their violence  so they went right to uh  yeah there was real  there wasn't enough violence with the car chase 
[00:10:00]  they're like ah let's see what's going on in bethlehem  let's go to the little church in bethlehem  that's how effed up our world is  yeah  they break from a car chase  because there's going to be no violence in the near future  let's go to bethlehem  plenty of violence going on over there right now  bethlehem  oh back to the car chase  what's going on  nice  did he get off  which route he might take  uh but that is uh in fact  breaking news  driver weaving in and out of traffic  on golden state highway  in los angeles  north of los angeles  capabilities  uh to just notify them on the radio 
[00:10:30]  uh they'll be ready  and uh we'll uh go ahead  and uh turn them over to them  as soon as they're ready  they'll have uh patrol uh vehicles  on the on ramps  blocking traffic  oh the local police  no it's great  they got an official analyst now  and uh as soon as they see the vehicle pass  they'll get on the uh rear of this vehicle  and they'll continue the pursuit  that way uh we have our uh units  uh with uh full enough gas  to come back to their area  and  it's like a stock car race  they gotta know when to refuel  right 
[00:11:00]  all right  officer mendoza  in your experience here  how do these usually end  they run out of gas  okay  underway in southern california  there a car chase  what a stupid question  you know what  she's doing filler  it's an hour and a half  we all know how they end  we see them all the time  it's an hour and a half into it  how many more questions  can they ask this guy  how many more  you know why  because she's a stupid  sea sucker reporter  just report news  or go back to your local programming 
[00:11:30]  enough already  there's nothing to show  you know what  they like asking things like  how does this usually end  can we expect perhaps  is there a chance  of a flaming bloody wreck  because that's what we're hoping for  yeah of course they are  that's why we haven't tuned out  of this yet  they can tune out  it's like crack Jim  they got this  they know it could end horribly  they gotta stay with it  do you know in los angeles  people have  email alerts  and pagers  that  they subscribe to a company  and it alerts them  when there's a chase  so they can watch it  on television  oh yeah 
[00:12:00]  I wish I had that service  that's why you gotta love  the los angeles riots  you gotta love the earthquakes  it's an awful  soulless dump  they know how to handle things  like every other state  has decided  yeah you know  when they get into  a chase situation  we'll back off  and let them go  because they endanger  too many people  I like that  I like that  I like their  their moxie  they got there  in California  let's chase them  until someone dies  by the way  can I just interject  really quick  off the subject  Tiger Woods' girlfriend  if she ate Mexican food

[00:18:00]  maybe a foot  pursuit will be  good if he has  a weapon  they could shoot  him  that'd be fun  but they said  he was a black  guy  a white guy  so I don't  think he'll  have a weapon  right Earl  right  why are there  never any  retarded kids  crossing a  Los Angeles  freeway  how great  would that be  make it a little  interesting  now it has  turned into  a low speed  OJ style  chase  this is going  to be another  bad ending  a horrendous  ending  two cops  behind him  he's still

[00:20:30]  rich boss  parting gift  well someone  has to buy  these things  Saturday  go ahead  boss  let's play  golf Saturday  down in  Virginia  in Virginia  you're going  to be down  there  yeah I'm  going down  Friday  oh you're  doing the  gig with  Norton  that's  right  yeah  we'll  figure it  out  yeah  alright  boss  you want  to see a  good chase  watch  Norton  in front  of  Edelweiss  alright  I'm going  to close  on that  one  and you 
[00:21:00]  really  are  an ass  he's calling  to make  hangout  plans  in front  of  18  cities  yeah I  know  that never  works  where do you  want to meet  for the gig  stupid  exactly  we'll talk  later  thank you  boss  alright  bye  you know  what they  broke  Fox is really  stupid  that's MSNBC  I think  right or is it  Fox  it's Fox  they broke  a commercial  right at the end  of the chase  it looked like  it was going to end  any second  they break to  commercials  ass monk  gotta make that  money  god damn bastard  Sean from Jersey  said him and his  girlfriend yelled out 
[00:21:30]  chloroform  when Norton's head  appeared on the screen  during Spider-Man  a lot of different  things  someone yelled out  Jim Norton  sucks mule  a little long  for a quick little  yell out  I bet they had to go  to two showings  hey Norton  put your god damn  hat back on  was the one  that somebody  yelled out  that was hilarious  alright  Scott what's up  what's up boys  hey  yo Norton  the crowd went nuts  it was a packed 
[00:22:00]  theater on Long Island  Friday night  and you came on the  screen  there must have been  25 or 30  different people  in the theater  cheering your name  it was awesome  how funny is that  it was awesome  it was your movie  the $114 million  made over the weekend  broke all box office  records  and Norton's  in the goddamn movie  yeah my fathead  probably would've made  $250 million  if it wasn't for  that weekend cameo  alright they're back  they're gonna stop  all traffic  at Fraser Park  in the meantime  there's Lebec  which my understanding  is there's an exit for 
[00:22:30]  for a while  he was going so quickly  that we were wondering  in fact asking our  it's actually  Lebec  not Lebec  whatever  the guy's going  it's 15 miles an hour  we were asking  is it possible  that this guy is  just rolling along  that this is a downhill  maybe it's a downhill  I was just thinking  that myself  but for some reason  he's going at this  slow pace  could that mean  that somehow  he lost a tire  along the way  the tire came off  the wheel  we have a number  of chopper angles  as you can see  and we've not been able  to  the cops look 
[00:23:00]  ridiculous  they can afford  to be made  to look ridiculous  they're chasing the car  going maybe  15 miles an hour  now it's doing  15-20 miles an hour  not even  this thing is crawling  and the cops are  keeping their distance  I understand why  so don't get all  pissed off  where's Captain McCluskey  he's a war hero  hold him up  hold him up  a little too old  for my job  how's the Italian food here  try the veal  it's the best  in this city  there you go  it looks like  he's coming to a stop  yeah I mean 
[00:23:30]  he really does  he can't go any slower  he can't go any slower  than that  get the cops  get the cars  next to him  shoot him  shoot him now  he's just  nobody on the freeway  the cops that close behind  nobody around  to be hurt  why aren't they moving up  and bringing an entrance  that's what we said  stop listening to us  as I mentioned earlier  police aren't sure  whether or not  this guy is armed  they're moving up on him  that cop is going to get behind that  and use that as a shooter  shoot him  and he's behind it now 
[00:24:00]  and it would appear  to have weapons drawn  is it possible  that he's shooting out tires  well  it would appear  now he's certainly  got his guns drawn  this looks like  it will be the climax  of what has been  well  another high speed chase  in southern california  this began  in san bernardino  went for more than  two hours  or right at  two hours now  made its way  down  across the 10 freeway  up the 110  we transition  to the 5 freeway  up out of the  Los Angeles area  and now in the mountains  passing through  the Tahome Pass 
[00:24:30]  and now coming up  in a mountain town  called Lebeck  you know what the sad thing is  people that are watching  and listening  with the delay  we sound really stupid  I know  like it'll all end  and we're like  oh there it is  it's over  we're doing this for  the gang in their cars though  realizing that nobody  ever wins  three cop cars  stopped about  30 feet behind the car  well get them out  of the vehicle  they all have their  driver doors open  guns drawn  up in the hills  where winds are  30, 35, 40 miles an hour  he's apparently out of gas 
[00:25:00]  the driver's side  got the vehicle  clearly has some  front end damage  maybe some  take back the vehicle  put your hands in the air  take your pants off  in this particular case  it's not LAPD  because it's way  out of their jurisdiction  but the California  Highway Patrol  in a defensive stand  each officer  then I'm moving in on  don't they know  we have a radio show  to do  come on  quick hits  you gotta be quick  with this  oh one cop  is pulling back  a little in his car  moving back  just a little bit 
[00:25:30]  I said that  come up with something else  we already covered that  have rehearsed  or practiced  many times  a lot of  California Highway Patrol  officers have been  in this sort of situation  is he pulling that  threatening to kill himself  thing to buy some time  I hate that move  I'll shoot myself  another two hours  of negotiating  rarely do they end  in this particular way  headed north  on a freeway  so often  they'll get off  get dirty Harry  in there  here just shoot him  right through the back  window  another ass  off the street 
[00:26:00]  you gotta get rid  of these asses  I have a feeling  he's just gonna sit there  yeah  you got nothing to  say for yourself  your mouthwash  ain't making it  ain't making it  a fourth cop car  has arrived  my coffee  has 15 sugars  in it  remember that one  girl the dino  wanted to alert him  that something was wrong  so just poured a bunch  of sugar in there  one officer in charge  so he goes in shooting  as quickly as they can  to get some sort of  negotiated  in the meantime  a well trained leader 
[00:26:30]  among these officers  will try to talk  on a bullhorn  through a public address  talk at a bullhorn  talk this guy  get out of the vehicle  or we will shoot you  we will shoot you  you ass  you got like  three seconds  one two three  that's negotiating  possible or not  this is coddling  remains to be seen  a good friend  is a former police  officer in the  Los Angeles area  a homicide detective  as well 
[00:27:00]  Rod Bernson  is his name  he's up in the chopper  or commentating  for the chopper  for Fox 11  in Los Angeles  Rod is with us now  what are they saying  Rod  they're telling him  you don't have  any choice here  you are going to  go to jail  that the only option  that you have  is to come out  of the car  and submit to  arrest  one way or another  you're going to jail  and just let him  know that he  doesn't have any  options  there's no room  for negotiation  here  he's going to jail  he's committed  any number of crimes  Mike wants to know 
[00:27:30]  if you could just  call Spider-Man  and have him  catch the guy  imagine that  what would he do  just put a web  on him or something  I wouldn't know  I didn't see the film  I would wrap the car  up in like a web  and suspend it  like from a bridge  where you could  come get him later  or something  right  I think that would work  so what the officers  just do  or Superman  might be better  because he could  just fly under the car  pick it up  and bring it right  to the police station  and shake him  out of the window  right into a cell  or maybe just  blow in the tube 
[00:28:00]  and hope his wheelchair  crush the car  that's what Superman  could do  what do we do now  and how do we  yeah what do we do now  do we do our radio show  or do we continue  with this crap  step  out of the field  alright waxed fruit head  look in the bed  on the floor  Wonder Woman  could tie him up  with that lasso  of truth  that she has  and titillate him a bit  with her body parts  Linda Carter  Aquaman 
[00:28:30]  could do nothing  it's on land  Aquaman's stupid  maybe we could fly  Rich Voss out  to tell the guy  some jokes  alright I give up  excuse me  person I'm being chased  hi Rich Voss here  I was the first man  ever on the  deaf comedy jam  I'd just like to  tell you a few things  I owe my daughter  money  and I'm dodging her  just like you're  dodging the cops  I dodge my daughter  you wanna buy  a bail bond 
[00:29:00]  listening to  local coverage  at KTGV Los Angeles  alright I give up  stop  enough  the chase is over  no matter of  figuring out  what's gonna happen  next  you heard Rod  Bernson  who's  a former police  officer himself  are they still  talking about the car  chase or what  they're gonna do  with this radio station  in New York City  we'll use that  is Rod  Bernson gonna be  taking over a slot  they don't have any  probable cause  to do that 
[00:29:30]  he hasn't committed  a felony  what  and as far as  rushing up there  and trying to  resolve this  too quickly  just because  why don't they  move the cop cars  up a little  think about  the civil lawsuits  and think about  police officers  think about our  radio show  end this thing  yeah come on  we're in a  quandary  we committed  to this car  chase  I know  we went with it  we can't just  end now  so uh  it looks like a  standoff  see that's the  problem  they want to  resolve it  without people  getting hurt  if you hurt 
[00:30:00]  the person  that is  doing the  driving  then it might  deter people  from doing it  in the future  well then you get  the civil suits  and stuff  Anthony  then you throw  them all out of  court  uh  Lou what's up  hey guys how you  doing  pretty good Lou  I saw a spider-man  on Friday  at an i'm mixed  theater  and my wife  was with me  she said  what the hell  was that  when she saw  Norton's dome  on the screen  what the hell  is that  it's a big  huge head  on the screen  how big was  his head  in feet 
[00:30:30]  in the IMAX  it must have  been about  15 feet  15 foot  big  your head  15 feet tall  and shiny  how is that  Norton  presidents and  dignitaries  looking at my head  you're looking at  your head  you guys suck  take care  think of all  the people  that saw  your face  and the five  that remember  over the weekend  doesn't matter  it's like a  subliminal thing  they'll feel  dirty  the rest of  their lives  they'll start  hanging around  schoolyards  Brian what's up  hey guys 
[00:31:00]  what's going on  I got an early  what did we learn  car chases  are just as  valuable as  brewer bits  when you guys  got nothing  we actually have  a lot to do  on the show  today  but we went  with this  you should see  the traffic  backup they  just showed  I'm sure  have one of  those guys  let the people  out  that are stuck  in traffic  to pull him  out of his  car  we thought  this would  be a five  minute thing  we were  watching the  back office  we started  watching this  at 2  it's now  3.30  I know  come on  and it started 
[00:31:30]  around like  1.30  they just had  it like two  straight hours  that's funny  though  bastard  remind me  to tell you  about my  awful walk  over to the  studio today  do it now  we got filler  I figure  you're going  to break  no  because  what if  they end it  now we're  screwed  now we're  screwed  this guy's  effing up  our radio  show  what happened  to you  on the way  to the station  I have to  incorporate  so I'm in  the process  of it  incorporate  Jim Norton  incorporated  no I don't  want to say  the name  yet though  it's a secret  we'll see 
[00:32:00]  15 seconds  of fame  incorporated  is taken  so I'm on  my way  to the  post office  and there's  you know what  this story  sucks  I just  realized  this story  really stinks  I'm walking  I can't get  a P.O. box  I go to one  the gorilla  behind the  counter  says that  there is  no  and she  was white  so I  don't  want to  hear  anybody  complaining  there's no  post office  box  I go to  another  post office  no  post office 
[00:32:30]  box  how do you  not have  a P.O. box  so I'm  walking  I'm cranky  I'm hot  no  no  and I  look in  a van  and he  goes  hey  Norton  and it's  crazy  Paul  which is  what you  really want  to see  when you're  ready to  commit a  homicide  and so I  get in  his car  what are you  getting in  his car  for  he's driving  me to  mailboxes  etc  here comes  crazy  Paul  why is  crazy  Paul even  here  you had  to bring  him to  the station  with you  no I  didn't  crazy  Paul is  a prime  example  of people  that hated  this program  when we  first started 
[00:33:00]  in New York  and grew  to love it  and love  all of the  individual  players  here so  if you're  in a new  city that  we broadcast  to and  you can't  stand us  you feel  exactly like  Paul did  and we  even have  some audio  which we're  going to  play I'm  sure  Rick is  trying to  get it  yeah we  play that  enough  yeah I  don't need  to spend  time on  crazy  Paul today  wow  I was  telling  that  were you  talking to  the mic  how many  times have  you been  in the  studio  alright  doesn't  stay  it's like 
[00:33:30]  my  sphincter  is this  going to  make the  story a little  more interesting  hopefully  well yeah  the whole  thing is  I'm coming  down 8th  avenue  as far as  Rick's  rule of  radio  goes  they've  all  tuned  out  oh I  know  they tuned  out as soon as we said  hey we're following a car chase to start our show today  13 minutes ago  why should I listen to you guys do the car chase when I could turn on the TV  right  go ahead Paul  we're still watching by the way nothing's going on up on the screen  I'm driving down 8th avenue  and I see somebody  was this before or after lunch 
[00:34:00]  after lunch  what do you have for lunch  I don't know get out of here what do I have for lunch  how do I know a cheese doodle  this is the same story but from a different perspective  did you have something wrapped in a tortilla  he's walking in the middle of 8th avenue talking to himself having an argument  I said who's this mental patient I'm going to run him over with the truck  I turn him like hey Jimmy what's up  I had no idea who it was at first  and he's arguing with himself post office post office stinks  when you're telling these little stories  here's a good idea  have a point  it makes it so much more interesting for the listener 
[00:34:30]  I think  and  well no  then he's going to make mention of something  and I'll  jump in again  alright  then what happened Jim  I don't know what's more exciting  this story or this car chase  or this non-car chase  as I started telling the story  and I  did I not just realize that this story stinks  and I said it  it's awful  yeah  it's true  shut up Demi  I thought I had a point with this  and I  shut up Demi  and you don't  you gotta finish it 
[00:35:00]  alright  so I get in  shut up Demi  you did not just fall for that  I did  shut up Demi  and then  I'm walking  shut up Demi  there's a cop  he's walking to the side of the road  to take a leak  he's so bored  I swear to you  he's sitting down on the guardrail  so I get in his van  yeah  why is this  the cop is going over the guardrail now 
[00:35:30]  I decided  he's not going to do that  where is he going  he was going to go take a leak  is the guy out  is he out  is he  we should warn our viewers  that we will stay wide on this  deliberately  because if  we don't know what could happen  ah you pussies  now he got back into his car Rod  well  that's not good news  the good news is  he got out of his car  so  well he's alive  he clearly can't say  he never knew that  highway patrol officers  were sitting behind him  on the stop freeway  as a defense  that tells the officers 
[00:36:00]  that he probably understands them  they understand the directions and orders  and he's just not going to comply  so as I was mentioning  you see one of the officers there  and again  since the suspect doesn't have access to a television  we're comfortable in showing this  otherwise we wouldn't  a CHP officer  trying to make his way up  and get an eyeball on that car  we're keeping a wide shot  so you can't see if his head explodes  this guy's an ass  I'm sure he has a friend somewhere  giving him a play-by-play through a cell phone  dude there's a cop 
[00:36:30]  coming up the car  the reason I know  is because Fox is showing this live  was he agitated  did he use foul language  did he make threats  is he talking about Norton  at the mailboxes at center  so even in that brief few seconds  that he was out of the car  alright you know what  we probably should take a break  I'm done  I'm done with this chase  and then I'll tell you  when people come back  like what finally happened  when we got there  I figure that'll get people listening  ooh  save the radio teases for me 
[00:37:00]  you're awful  you stink  and I don't like you  I'm the worst  this is a radio tease  ready  yeah  two more clips  from the trainable video  oh that's great  we have the clip of  can we  Rick you check  one of the trainables  had a wet dream  and how to explain  what happened  with the wet dream  and then we have  a radio clip  an audio clip  of a mother  yeah  catching her son  a trainable 
[00:37:30]  taking care of himself  did her son look like that  a trainable  a retard  oh yeah  really  I think so  I thought that was just  a mother walking in  on her son  oh that's another  educational video  it's all on the same piece  but yeah  the kid doesn't look  like he's retarded  no  if it's part of  like a strapping young buck  if it's part of  the trainable section  of that DVD  then he's definitely  a little slow  I don't know  they just want him  to look all cute  and stuff for Hollywood  they may have just used him  because they couldn't  find one that would do it  yeah tussleable 
[00:38:00]  70's hair  so we got those  two audio clips  we'll play next  alright  if this car chase thing  ends we'll break  in spots  or something  oh bastards  five  two  three  four  hit it  hold naked girls  hold naked girls  turn it off  turn it off  hold porno  hold porno  it's not good for you  it's not good for you  who else gives you  porno and comedy  at the same time 
[00:38:30]  a stupid program  called the Opie and Anthony show  MW  hey we're back  with the Opie and Anthony show  Karachi  stick him up  alright well  the car chase is back on  but then it stopped again  yeah the guy  he took off  yeah well  exactly  he was stopped  and then next thing you know  he decided to take off again  and then the idiot  drove into what  a gravel road  or something 
[00:39:00]  yeah this is  in California  a lot of hills  Opie  and it seems that  when there's a steep  downgrade  they have these little  turn offs  that trucks can take  if their brakes fail  and it slows them down  and stops them  it's like  progressively deeper  and deeper gravel  and the guy  drove into it  so he drove into this gravel  and all the cops  went in behind him  and now he's stopped  there again  but uh  the cops again  are just kinda  sitting there 
[00:39:30]  yeah at this point  he's going nowhere  there's two, four, six cops  I was hoping after  they let him go  the first time  he was just  he would run into  a school bus  full of children  and kill them  so everybody could sit there  and go  oh you had him  oh you had him  six cop cars  the cops have  surrounded them  surrounded him  I don't think he can move now  now we're just kinda  sitting here  waiting for him  this vehicle once belonged  you remember that  this began  with a car  that had no plates on it  and that's the reason  they were stopping it  in the first place  so police officers 
[00:40:00]  may be in a position now  where they have  absolutely no information  about this particular guy  except what they've seen  over the past two hours  they may not have  any idea  whether he's a violent criminal  or has been in the past  oh my god  they are just sitting there  now  well this report  coming in  from Massachusetts  CBS reporting  the driver is Rock Hole  and he's gonna make  the first cop  that pulls him  out of the car  his new sidekick  so it seems to be  some kind of  stunt 
[00:40:30]  hey  thank you officer  you're my new  on air partner  my new victim  my new on air victim  I won't be supporting you  when they fire you  but  yeah when they fire you  I'm not even gonna  make like you existed  guy is out of the car  alright  looks like his arms are up  the question is  will he do what he's  supposed to do now  or will he not  what they're telling him  to do is to walk away  from the vehicle  with his hands in the air 
[00:41:00]  lie down flat on the pavement  put both  and no  he said  he goes  are they having  some sort of dialogue here  very good question  you should have shot him  the guy got out  it looked like  he was gonna surrender  and you just heard it  and all of a sudden  he said F that  and went back in his car  and slammed the door shut  I bet he starts it up  and hangs a U-turn  if he can get out  of the gravel  huh  oh they got a dog  ready to go in  oh I love the dogs  when they get to  send the dogs in  oh get him off me  get him off me 
[00:41:30]  I love that  they got a dog  just waiting  to pounce  they're not gonna  get the chance though  because I think  the guy saw the dog  and said you know what  I'll take my chances  inside the vehicle  use a taser  those are fun too  like when he gets  out of the car  there's somebody  by that guard rail  just hit him  with the taser  ah Kevin  hey  what's up Kevin  hey did anybody  else catch the  fact that Norton's  character in  Spider-Man  had the initial  of STD  surly truck driver 
[00:42:00]  sexually transmitted  disease  wow  look at that  mistake Norton  that's classic  that sounds calculated  that is  hey Jimmy  nope  no I ain't gonna  work  alright  thank you  let's go to Ed  hey Ed what's up  hey O&A  what's going down  honorary inside veteran  I've been for you guys  since day one  you're my god  cool what's up  I just want to say  I saw Spider-Man  and I saw Norton  and I just realized  that it really is  a weak chin  meaty breast  of talentless  vilch  oh my god  I wouldn't say  talentless 
[00:42:30]  I would  you should see  his 30 foot head  on the big screen  is a goof  I can't wait  alright we gotta  get back to the car  chase  car chase now  it's a standoff  he is apparently  leaning on the vehicle  well you can see it  yeah  he's not doing  what he's supposed  to do  his hands are  supposed to be  in the air  right now  it'll appear  he's almost  doing a little  dance there  for police officers  and now he's  back in the vehicle  what an idiot  look man  you gotta shoot him  this guy's gonna have  no fun  once he gets  to a lock up  somewhere  because he is 
[00:43:00]  he's messing  with these officers  on what I can tell  you right now  is international  television  not just on this  channel  this thing  is getting some  play  let me tell you  I hear  Opie and Anthony  have nothing to do  on their radio show  today  and they've decided  to go with this  as well  we really do  have things to get to  but we committed  to this damn thing  where this guy's  gotten away  they've told him  to get out of his car  told him to put his  hands in the air  told him to spread  Eagle down on the ground  and told him  he has nowhere to go  because he doesn't  have anywhere to go 
[00:43:30]  but he's not cooperating  they're probably wondering  is this guy on something  has he committed a crime  that he has nothing  to lose here  is that a possibility  they're gonna lose the house  Dean what's going on  hey what's up boys  how you doing  little Jimmy  he's doing good  he's watching  you know  Shepard Smith man  it's just like  the biggest effing  tool on the planet  you don't like  Shepard Smith's  not at all  I really think  Tom Brokaw  could do a much  better job  calling the  shops on this  this is just 
[00:44:00]  into our  NBC news room  the most  ridiculous  the stupidest  car chase  I've ever witnessed  playing out now  on a California  freeway  Tom it's not a car  chase anymore  well we still  look  I'm the expert  in journal  in the news business  this is still  considered a car  chase  but the car's 
[00:44:30]  not moving  it's like  it is just a  zero speed car chase  I would call it  like a standoff  maybe  no it has not  I'm getting this  in my headphones  it has not yet  been considered  a standoff  until he stands up  this I know  believe me  I'm a professional  I went to  journalist school  and learned  how to talk  like this  like a professional  journalist  is this a labor  of love  for you  you know  this work  for me  is truly  honestly  but now 
[00:45:00]  as we  look  oh my god  it seems  to be  he's  sitting  in his car  wow  the excitement  just heart  pounding excitement  here  on NBC  Nightly News  this could be  the most boring  car chase  I've ever  witnessed  obviously  Opie and Anthony  have nothing  to do today  if they're covering  this mess  for the past  hour  Opie  would Jesus  love me  would Jesus  love me  answer  answer me 
[00:45:30]  would Jesus  love me  that was Tyson  sir  and I'll kick  your ass  like a man  sure he will  oh boy  let's go to Tom  hey Tom  what's going on  hey what's up  boys  I have a feeling  this guy's  going to be  waiting until  520 to get  shot  this sucks  that would be  perfect  you guys have  now coined  the new phrase  snooze radio  I know  we're in this  together though  alright  he's getting  out of the car  again  let's see  what happens  oh come on  shoot him  now  shoot him 
[00:46:00]  shoot him  oh he's getting  out again  shoot him  now  we've seen  this before  wonder what's  going to  happen this  time  let the dog  go right  now  let the dog  go  just watching  and waiting  now  the police  have given  him  or the  highway  patrol  has given  him  specific  instructions  so that  you know  we are now  on a 5 second  delay  you will not  see  if this turns  ugly  we will not  be broadcasting  to the world  you bastards  stop acting  like you're  responsible  you want  no risk  of something  horrendous  showing up  on your  table  we'll get  the wrong  video from 
[00:46:30]  psycho  mark  none of  that will  be necessary  the guy  is seeming  to act  a little bit  more  we got  friends  in fox  his hands  down by  his side  that is not  what the cops  have in mind  he's going  for a gun  shoot him  that's a gun  that they're  waiting  and instructing  and I hope  I'm looking at  the same monitor  that you are  because I know  we're on a delay  and I hope  I'm watching the  delay  if the stage  manager can come  over and check  to make sure  that I'm watching  the delay  shut up  you stupid  bastard  highway patrol  chopper 
[00:47:00]  oh my god  they're able  to broadcast  instructions as  well  we don't know  if they're doing  so from that  chopper  they also have  that capability  what's the line  if they shoot him  they won't show up  can they go over  there and just  beat the crap  out of them  we'll let you know that  yeah we get to see  them get beat up  which still  is not happening  Tommy on line 8  how great would it be  if a truck had to  use the emergency  ramp right now  hands up at  2 o'clock  feet down  at 4 o'clock  and 8 o'clock  what time is it  so far  it hasn't happened 
[00:47:30]  that's what police  are waiting on  it hasn't happened  shoot him  they've been giving  instructions throughout  he's moving  oh where's he going  now he's made him  okay now  no don't want to do  that do you  what  he moved to the  back of the car  this is the strangest  thing  he took a look  and said no  this is one of  the stranger ones  i mean it started  out pretty routine  driving around  where is he now  though  geo metro  street to street  freeway  and then just  started heading north  on the 5 freeway  we went on with  other news  oh you sure did  but we didn't  on the Opie and  Anthony show  we stayed with 
[00:48:00]  the story  that's right  oh where is he  what are they doing  oh he's on the ground  things get weird  and he's running  and he's running  toward the car  and that's a dog  they let follow him  we've gone wide  on purpose  stop it  we think it's safe  to go back tight  we will  the chopper is making  those decisions for us  and in we go  i'm watching on another  monitor that's tighter  that we're not going to  show you at the moment  because we think that's  the smart thing to do  you suck  but it would appear at least  that we manage  their friends' help  they've been able to 
[00:48:30]  maybe  just maybe  bring this thing to a man  you were hoping  there was going to be  disaster  they suck  dirty sea suckers  and fox  and the dude  in the metro  is finished  for the day  thanks  we didn't see it  I'm sure that they're  going to come up  a list as long as  you're on  they went to the  hubble shot  we're trying to go hard  out here  so I'm looking for that  the guy went to like  the back of the car  and they let one of the  dogs go  yeah  and the dog caught him  before he could get  back into the car  that's what it looks like 
[00:49:00]  from this angle  dogs roll  fox sucks  dirty sea suckers  you know I hate  phonies  they're a bunch of  hypocrites  the only reason they've  been showing this  chase for the last  two hours  is because they were  hoping for death  and destruction  it's not that exciting  to see a car chase  if you're not going  to see the good stuff  we're not going to  stop protecting us  you sea sucking  hypocrites  but you know what  it's like  if they're chasing the car  and it just happens  the car flips and stuff  like you could say  well hey  we didn't know  that was going to happen  hey hey  but then when it  gets to this point  then they have to make  that executive decision 
[00:49:30]  like well alright  this is what we want  to say  someone's going to  call us out on this  so we'll make believe  we care  stop pretending  just show it  for what it is  be honest for once  can the media  for once be honest  we're going to go  to the long shot  because that's  the smart thing  to do  the challenger  blowing up  we can handle  but we can't  see some dirtbag  being yanked  out of his car  how many dead people  have we seen  in the mid east  so far  they've shown  of course  like people being  shot and killed  I've seen it  on the news  they show it  someone being shot  but it's far away  see the distance 
[00:50:00]  is good  right  this is California  it's the United States  we can't show that  we'll show dirty  people dying  right  I want to see  everything  it's news  I want to see it  does anybody remember  the towers  we all watched  them happening  we can't handle this  stop trying to think  for everyone  you dirtbags  yeah how about that  they showed that  8 billion times  they showed thousands  of people dying  but for some reason  people jump it  they gotta go  to the wide show  that's the smart  thing to do  stop thinking  for everyone else  Jim you're not 
[00:50:30]  capable of  individual thought  we need people  to think for us  what we want to say  and that's dirty  and I tell you  I hope both his parents  are killed in a fire  erect that reporter  who's telling them  to go to the other shot  you scumbag  don't act like you're  concerned because you're not  alright Sean has  some inside info here  yes Sean  yeah what's going on man  this is Justin  the guy who stole  the cars on dope  stole it from Squaresville  and he's headed up  to Kicksville  oh is that it  it was from Squaresville  to Kicksville  I heard the chase 
[00:51:00]  started in his garage  where all the good  stuff is  that's where all  the good drugs are  and we all know that  Keith the cop  hey what's going on  hey  dude I got this  incredible car chase  story  yeah  last week I was  chasing this car  and we pulled him  over  and I gave him  a ticket  that's just as  exciting as  dude Fox  is the worst  we you know  we had to go  with it  how'd it go  with it  they never  last this long  and we're going  to start the

[01:07:00]  retards  yeah one had a  wet dream  and how you're  supposed to discuss  it  you've got  it's up  and how you're  supposed to discuss  it with him  with your tard  so uh... he doesn't  feel uncomfortable  well you know  i think i'm  hudson say  dirty boy  and then the other  audio is classic  there's uh... there's a guy  he's a trainable  they call them trainables  back then  i'm sure the pc world  doesn't like that term  anymore  well retards went  through so many  different names 
[01:07:30]  it's like uh... you  know african-american  you know it didn't  start out at that  it started out with  names that now would  be considered derogatory  fun names when you  were in the privacy of  your own home and  you're watching a  ball game  well there was  actually a term  a time where uh...  colored was a  legit term  and it was even  uh... adopted by  uh... blacks as  as their organizational  national association  for the advancement  of colored people  isn't it amazing now  by the way  it's just to  they've  colored people is  considered degrading 
[01:08:00]  and yet you stupid  liberals will say  people of color  people of color  that's considered  very politically  correct  yes very  you really are  dumb  you're a great person  if you use that term  people of color  you like  and then negro  was a term that was  used  yes for a while  that was fine  and then afro-american  you remember that one  my favorite  sort of in the 70s  my favorite was  shwugi  shwugi i think  uh... was never  really widely used  well bruce try to  make it the 
[01:08:30]  acceptable term  down south  shwugi  down south there  were uh...  uh... people would  uh... open up places  like uh... coons  they'd call a place  coons if it deserved  uh...  uh... soul food  but now  like though we're  talking about  the word like  trainable  a trainable  was a retard  right  a retard  that was considered  somebody who was  uh... good enough  that you could train  them  or pull a train  on them  or pull a train  on them  whatever works  certain aspects  of their uh...  lives 
[01:09:00]  they could lead  uh... as close  to normal  as possible  well when we get  back we have  another audio clip  of a mom  catching her uh...  trainable son  what do they call  them now  what do they call  retards now  they're not called  retards anymore  oh they're called uh...  retards when i was  growing up  mentally handy  capable  mentally challenged  mentally challenged  i don't think  it's handy capable  mount rushmore  headed dope  just doesn't seem  right i guess  in some people's eyes  wow  it's all  what time you live in 
[01:09:30]  the day and age  there was slow  remember slow  what do they call them  in the little house  on the prairie time  dim  dim  dimwitted  dimwitted  slow  he's dim  i like that one  i want that one  to come back  and retarded means  something is retarded  it means stunted  i believe  yeah held back a bit  can i just say  that you politically  correct people  who hyphenate everything  i really mean this  i hope you accidentally  drink leukemia  at a picnic  you lying  self esteem  giving pieces of garbage  right  covering up on their 
[01:10:00]  own problems  i wish they are  can you drink leukemia  i don't know how that works  accidentally  i imagine if someone said  there's the leukemia  no one would go  well where's a cup  hence accidentally put in there  in a big punch bowl  with a ladle in it  just you  i just hate politically correct  i mean i know everyone hates  but i mean you really are  it's just like  it's just like people  that are um  hidden sex offenders  that try to cover up  their own problems  with making it so no one else  could look at any type of pornography 
[01:10:30]  and liberals are people  that are so guilt ridden  about being uh  uh  whatever race they are  you know  usually uh  a lot of liberals  are uh  these little white people  that run around  wanting to save the world  their problem is  maybe  maybe  the word nigger  flashed through their head once  uh  and now they have to do things  or maybe  maybe they were  cut off in traffic  by an asian gentleman  and  and the word  chink  popped in their head 
[01:11:00]  and now they have  such a problem  that they got to go out now  and save the world  and they have a superiority complex  and here's what bugs me about them  and this is not  i don't want to hear from every liberal  going hey i vote democrat  and i'm alright  it's not the political ideology  it's the arrogance of some of them  stop being so paternalistic  alright  black people  they don't need your help  alright  they don't need the lady white genius  to put a little hand down  there you go  that's a superiority complex  it's based in arrogance  and intellectual leadership  very good  and it makes me want to vomit  stop being politically correct  just be honest  trying to help just like now 
[01:11:30]  with the women  groups  it's the same thing  they feel  that they are in a  position of power  to tell people  how to act  and what they should do  and intellectually superior to them  like helping little children  look what i'm doing  look what i'm doing now  helping the little person  who couldn't do it without me  you arrogant white boars  let it go  and let your stupid kids  grow dreadlocks  and think that you're hip  and alternative  when you're just boring  little middle aged douches  that's all you are  you hippie throwbacks  scumbags  nice 
[01:12:00]  that makes me  absolutely nauseous  just be yourself  well it should  well we're going to play  the audio clip  of mommy catching  her retard  her retard  her son  jackin  jackin  he's jackin  walks right in  on the poor dim  and the music they play  is hilarious  oh yeah  when he gets caught  and then she acts  like a robot  as she gives  the son the speech  she's giving the speech  that should set the kid  up for life  right  yeah  she should go over there  and spit in her hand  and help out 
[01:12:30]  you want to be helpful mom  so we'll do that next  unless we go off  on another stupid tangent  the opie and anthony show  only road baby  yeah sure  and what holy ass  holy mother  who's that  i don't know  people send me  links  gorgeous  various websites

[01:18:00]  i'd have to move  out  the things that  seemed offensive  to them  was the  nude part  of the contest  and then in quotes  it says  46 year olds  don't behave  this way  so i guess  that is  something they  told you  patty  yes or no  well yeah  yes  now the people  at home  don't normally  hear the show  but people  they know  do  i was referred  to as a  tramp  etc  by these  killers  i'm in a 
[01:18:30]  dilemma  as i need  the money  yet i have  nothing to  move with  and do not  need  and do need  the roof  over my head  too  do i give up  on a chance  to win some  much needed  money  or do i lose  my shelter  as a result  or do i take  the box that  carol merrill  is standing by  and perhaps get  zonked with  an ox  i have to  choose the  roof over  my head  because with  my foot  condition  i'm in no 
[01:19:00]  physical condition  to deal with  a housing  issue  patty patty  come right  down here  i'm giving you  a choice to  win some  much needed  money  but it may  result in  losing your  shelter  patty let's  make a deal  you could get  money  perhaps enough  money to  move  or  you won't  get the  money  yet you  will still  lose  where you  live  interesting 
[01:19:30]  interesting  little laundry  do you have  a paper clip  in your purse  a paper clip  for a dollar  anyone  a rubber  band  two dollars  for a rubber  a rubber  band  the woman  dressed as  a  i was gonna  say the c  word  do you have  a cane  in an  unused  box  patty i'll  give you  this twenty  dollar bill  to show me  an intact  hymen  she gets  twenty dollars  you are a

[01:21:00]  pastro convertible  changes into a  bed on the  streets  look at this  ah  totally empty  nothing in  there  patty  i guess i'll  read the rest  of your letter  she's in a  dilemma  she has to  choose  i'm in no  physical condition  when i'm doing 
[01:21:30]  better  and can  eventually  find another  place to  live on my  own  in a real  apartment  situation  then it  won't matter  what i do  in my  outside  activities  but right  now while  other people  are monitoring  me  for whatever  reason  i need to  be careful  i guess i  cannot do  the keen  test  i need  the money  but i also  need a  roof  over my  head  and do  not have  the means  to find  another  place  to live  what to 
[01:22:00]  do  what to  do  help  patty  and then she  has an  afterthought  this is a  clever one  patty  uh oh  cherry springer  it probably  wouldn't have  been possible  if my  identity  oh it probably  would have been  possible if my  identity didn't  have to come  out like  perhaps during  the contest  after under  a different  name  so no one  knows  my  landlord  will know  it's me  what  under someone 
[01:22:30]  else's name  so no one  who knows  my landlord  will know  it's me  then i might  not be in  trouble  hi  i'm  penelope  i'm a  14 year old  45 year old  virgin  you're stuck  up in  penelope  would you change  your voice too  patty  yeah  that's impossible  how would you  change it  go ahead  go a little  higher  she does that  thing with her  neck  that's impossible

[01:23:30]  you're not living in a  home are you  do you live in a  home  no  is it a home  that like they  monitor what you  do and and and  did you sign a lease  that says it has a  morality clause in it  there was no lease  it was a friend  and i'd have been  thrown out of the  playboy mansion for  some of my antics  yet i i don't live  uh my life with other  people telling me  what the hell to do  i mean yeah you are  a gimp and an ass but  you're an adult  right you're an adult  free to do whatever  you want and i i think  there's a problem 
[01:24:00]  with living somewhere  and having people tell  you you will be  thrown out  for doing stuff that  you want to do and  you are free to do as  an adult  i bet you there's  people from the  housing authority that  would that would not  allow that to happen  it probably is illegal  illegal  no no no  look at her flapping  her arm  look at her flapping  her little wing  why are you gonna be in  trouble  trouble for what  because people heard  the show  and they're gonna  they hear it  and they  Landry will hear you  what are you worried  about these people

[01:25:00]  of your life  patty  yeah  so what you have  hair like edith bunker  that's no reason  to boot you out  who are your real pals  who are your real pals  we're all friends  who are your real pals  that do things for you  and get your stuff  who gave you new feet  who gave you new feet  yeah  you too  right  who got rid of your awful hair  who got rid of your nipple hair  right  who waxed you  well who sent you to be waxed  exactly  who gave you sort of  a little social life  now that you go out  to these events 
[01:25:30]  right  who gave you two tickets  who gave you two tickets  twice  twice  who put a sweater  on that little  Reese's monkey body  yeah  who got Ron Jeremy  to do what he did to you  right  who got a man  to actually touch you  in a certain way  the first time ever  and who was the very first man  to ever touch  your bosoms  oh my god  that's right  it was me  that was the  Hollywood superstar  Jim Norton  that's right  Spider-Man star  Jim Norton  Spider-Man sidekick  Jim Norton  was your first 
[01:26:00]  I forgot all about that  Surly truck driver  yeah  STD  STD  that guy was right  so Patty  it's illegal for them  to kick you out  you cannot be thrown out  for what you do  in your life  housing authority  housing authority  I said it twice  stupid  and if they try  to throw you out  if they try  to throw you out  I swear to god  we will focus  all the resources  of this program  and the people  that listen  to making their life  a living hell  but they're very nice  I don't  no they're not  no they're not 
[01:26:30]  they're not  they're not nice people  they're telling you  from humiliating yourself  they're telling you  it was very nice  to help me out  when I needed a place  they give you a room  in exchange for cash  period  that is where  the obligation ends  you are allowed  to live your life  as an adult woman  not based on  someone else's  effing morality  you pay them rent  that's all you do  and how come  she's never had  anything in there  I know  she's a prude  if anything  hey Tom  what's up 
[01:27:00]  yo what's up guys  hi Angel  listen  yo she rents a room  she's got  no rights  whatsoever  they can toss her out  on her wrinkled ass  whenever they want  I bet you're wrong dude  I bet you're  no dude  I'm telling you  I'm not wrong  she rents a room  it's not even a lease  it's not a month to month  they literally  have to give her a week  and they can throw her out  she has to live by their rules  it's only a room  she's got no rights  believe me  but don't like  people who are like  really thin-lipped  and retarded  have special rights 
[01:27:30]  well the handicap issue  is one thing  but then they'll just  put her in a mental institution  Tom  Tom  no  yeah  no  even though there's no lease  there are certain laws  that are in place  where there is a time  that they can take  to throw you out  they can't just throw you out  and even though there's no lease  it can be proven  by paying rent  and showing a record  of paying rent  that you have been there  there are certain laws  that are in place  yeah but the only thing  she's got on her side  is that she's retarded 
[01:28:00]  and that's the only thing  that might help her  is because she's mentally ill  alright Tom  alright later  the only thing  that I could see  from the point of view  is that you're  under someone's roof  no it's not like a parent  no  no  parents can do that  they can say  as long as you live  under my roof  they're using scare tactics  right  and they're getting to you  and how are you going to  pay this rent  if you don't do this  because you're a little  fraidy cat  how are you going to pay  the rent there Patty  how do you pay the rent  have you been to work  with your gimpy feet  either way you're

[01:40:30]  as a grown woman  you know what  she's been here  my mother's put up  with her  she eats everything  in the whole house  I mean  she puts up with her  give me a break here  but but  give us a break here  one little thing  for not to be a pig  on the radio  why  it's not your say though  what she does  if she's going to do it  which I already heard  her say she is  put it here this way  my other sister's  already putting her  stuff outside  on the street  so tell her  I hope she finds it  tell her I hope  she finds it  why don't you stop it 
[01:41:00]  she doesn't pay rent  she doesn't have to live  yet she's fine  no lease  you know something  Kim  why are you  why are you  dictating  what a grown woman  can do  in her private life  oh she could do that  in her private life  in her private home  she lives in her  private home right now  my mother went out  it's a wonderful way  to be nice to her  to give her a place to live  she's not doing it  in your house  she's doing it  here in the studio  but everybody  that we know  knows that  and we have to hear  it from everybody  why are you harping  your own morality  on another person  why 
[01:41:30]  well maybe  she'll get some morals  right  based on your morality  no based on her own morality  maybe she needs  to get a little  maybe  and then she'll find out  that yous aren't  really her friends  she's a virgin  stupid  she's a virgin  on the radio  she's a virgin  she's never  she's never had sex  so what are you talking  about her morality  but that's not my problem  right  but what are you talking  about morality  doesn't it sound like  she's quite a moral person  we're teaching her  about her sexuality  right

[02:08:00]  of course  look at this  114 million dollar  gross  I didn't mean to be  so surely  truck driver  see it's the guy  why don't you go  call Kim back  and smooth things over  there  why don't you  smooth things over  with her  give her a call  off the air  use the phone  outside  smooth things over  smooth things over  with her  and let us know  how it goes  come back in  and let us know  what your choice is  tell her you were  feeling the pressure  on the air  and you made  the wrong decision  that cane  is a great accent  I think when they  fixed her feet  she holds her ass  different

[02:09:00]  one retard  all confused  after having a wet dream  and what to do  about it  according to this  instructional video  and then we got  a clip of a mom  catching her  retarded son  whacking  from Philly  says  effing Opie  ha ha ha  he completely  disregards the issue  makes fun of the  retarded kid  for the whole  conversation  oh god  that's too funny  and we got 
[02:09:30]  Sadie Allison here  she's a sexpert  a hot sexpert  wow  and we got  Alex Carroll  the speeding ticket guy  oh right  so we got lots  to do still  Anthony  and we gotta get  more contestants  for the ONA  money snatch game  now that  it looks like  Patty might be  dropping out  you know what  poor Sacramento  when they hear  the first break  with the car chase  they're gonna think  the whole show  is nothing  and then we have  that  yeah so if you're  still listening  in Sacramento  good choice  right  okay  we'll break 
[02:10:00]  and we'll continue  I guess  so remember  guns don't kill  people  dangerous minorities  do  the Opie and  Anthony show  it just doesn't  get any worse  than this  the Victor Zebra  finishing  after Zeppelin  plays  pretty much  what you're  gonna be getting  the Opie and  Anthony show  1027  WNAW  sorry about that 
[02:10:30]  you know the deal  we're back with  the Opie and  Anthony show  we do an hour  of straight radio  you gotta catch up  somewhere so  I apologize  apologize  we have a great  idea  as far as  Stalker Patty  goes  coming in from  Beth  from Virginia  we're Stalker Patty  we wanna  make a deal  with her  oh  we'll do a  let's make a deal 
[02:11:00]  segment  let's make a deal  she's very strapped  for cash  she wants to get  involved in this  money snatch  that we have  going on  on Wednesday  we're gonna get  more contestants  in a little while  but now it seems  that the people  that her landlord  doesn't want  her doing this  and it's threatened  that if she does  indeed go ahead  with the  money snatch  contest  she will be  thrown out  of her place  of residence  we got her  on the phone  and we were  yelling and  screaming at  each other  it doesn't seem  right that  she should  hold 
[02:11:30]  the very roof  over her head  over her head  that's right  I believe Patty  didn't you call  your landlord  I did try to  call the house  but they hung  up on me  and wouldn't  talk to me  why is that  I don't know  well I guess  they're angry  well that's silly  do you owe them  any money  no  I paid up  for this past  week  you know  they're not angry  it was just  to owe another  rent this Thursday  which I  they're not angry  Patty  it was just  feeding time  at the zoo  but anyway
