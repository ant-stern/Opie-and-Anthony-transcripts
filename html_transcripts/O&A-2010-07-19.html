<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts speculating about the mysterious cracking of Opie's iPhone, followed by a segment on "Homeless Roulette," a confrontation with a homeless man in women's makeup.  The conversation then transitioned to Opie's Yankee Stadium experience, detailing high prices, long lines, and questionable water vendor practices.  Caller Dave recounted a disputed Mets-Giants game call, and further calls discussed Yankee Stadium's amenities and pricing.  Anthony then recounted a wild weekend party with a questionable guest list, and Opie described a supermarket encounter with Fred Norris and his improved relationships with other SiriusXM personalities, interspersed with a Mel Gibson parody phone call.  Patrice O'Neal was a guest throughout a significant portion of this early part of the show.

The show continued with a discussion on the monotony of unemployment, contrasting the initial freedom with subsequent boredom and sleep disruption.  This led to daydreams about winning the lottery and helping loved ones.  A caller, Anthony from New York, presented an unsubstantiated claim about a CIA operation involving Charles Manson in Iraq, sparking a conspiracy theory debate.  Another caller, Rene, whose family members were incarcerated, challenged the hosts' view of prison life, leading to a heated, vulgar exchange about prison conditions, the death penalty, and reintegration challenges. Patrice O'Neal's upcoming stand-up shows were promoted during this segment.

The next segment started with a highly offensive and sexually explicit phone call, before moving into a sports discussion with Patrice O'Neal, focusing on the differences between hockey and basketball and devolving into racially charged commentary using highly offensive racial slurs and stereotypes. They debated the racial demographics of fan bases and players,  discussed LeBron James's move to the Miami Heat, and critiqued listener-submitted audio remixes featuring Mel Gibson and Pulp Fiction.  The segment concluded with analysis of racially charged commentary from a vintage Australian commercial and former sports commentator Jimmy "the Greek" Snyder, with the hosts attempting to recreate Snyder's remarks without offensive language.

A later portion of the show started with a discussion about a humorous LeBron James wrestling video and the balance between comedy and business in show development.  A significant part focused on the birthday celebration of studio guest "Jimmy," who had met Robert Duvall, leading to a conversation about celebrity encounters, including Yoko Ono, Sean Lennon, Dustin Hoffman, and Joe Pesci, and the Coppola family's Hollywood prominence.  Studio guests included Jimmy, Randy Couture, and Terry Crews.  Discussions about Crewsâ€™ career, *The Expendables*, *Rampage*, and *Taken* followed.  A conversation with Terry Crews about race and expectations in the entertainment industry and the *Expendables* cast dynamic concluded this section.

Finally, the show featured a discussion on fighting, comparing street fighting and MMA, with Couture demonstrating a chokehold on Opie.  The conversation shifted to Patrice O'Neal's and Marc Maron's comedic careers, with O'Neal discussing his struggles, quitting nicotine, and dating life, and Maron briefly discussing his relationship.  They discussed Terry Crews' Old Spice commercials, the concept of "comedy children," and jealousy in comedy, along with personal anecdotes involving O'Neal's struggles and girlfriend, and Anthony and Jimmy's experiences with erectile dysfunction.  The show concluded with further vulgar language and offensive humor.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Yeah, come on. Bring it on.  You know what? I think this is hilarious.  A whole big bunch of fun.  The greatest show on satellite radio today.  This show is like the box of chocolates. 
[00:00:30]  That Forrest's mother was talking about.  You're a no good son of a bitch.  Bob, you mother fucker.  We're so much fucking better than you.  Absolute lunacy.  If you're giving me the hook, fine. Whatever.  I do what I'm told.  I'm completely out of control.  It doesn't get better than this.  Come on. It's shocking.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's do this.  Holy shit, it's Monday already.  I know.  Good news, the lights are on in the hallway here at Sirius XM. 
[00:01:00]  I thought maybe Con Ed was shutting us down.  Save a little money.  Yeah.  You know how this place is.  I love this place.  This place rules.  Of all the places I've ever worked, this is the best place I've worked.  Of all the places I've ever worked.  Uh, my phone's, my phone's got a little crack in it. 
[00:01:30]  I know.  You're showing off the cracked iPhone.  And you don't know how it was done, which is kind of strange.  I have no idea how this happened.  I didn't drop it.  There are no abrasions on the edge where if you saw, if it fell and cracked that way.  There would be some kind of denty thing to prove that you dropped it.  Yeah.  It's on the back.  Mm-hmm.  And it's, coincidentally enough, it's right by that antenna gap that you're not supposed  to put your finger across.  Right. 
[00:02:00]  Lest you lose your signal.  Right.  Right on the back side of it.  Because the back of the iPhone is glass.  I don't know why.  Could you make it out of Kevlar or carbon fiber or something, motherfuckers?  Well, the glass looks really good.  I don't care.  It makes it look really good.  So now I got this crack, and it runs like there's three radials coming off of it that  just run the entire length of the phone.  It looks like it took a pebble.  It looks like it took a fucking BB.  But it looks like it took some kind of pebble. 
[00:02:30]  It's the same thing you would see in your windshield.  Yeah, yeah.  But a little deeper.  Yep.  You know, a pretty bad pebble, let's say.  I didn't have anything in my pocket.  So you don't know how that was done?  That means you had a great weekend.  Here it was, though.  Last night, this fucking phone was up on my armrest on my couch while I'm watching TV.  And it's upside down.  I saw the back.  There wasn't a crack or anything.  Then I go to take a text, and I look, and I pick the phone up, and it's cracked. 
[00:03:00]  Like something fell out of the ceiling and fucking hit the thing.  It might be related to the text that came in.  Some kind of devil thing.  Aw, shit.  Some kind of fucking fourth dimension shit.  Some kind of fucking...  Oh, man.  Yeah.  I didn't even think about that.  I'd be fucking with the wrong people.  Something from the Necromonicon.  Yeah, exactly.  Because if you don't know what happened, that's a little weird. 
[00:03:30]  It is weird, but it's not the front.  It's the back.  It's cosmetic, but there's one kind of sharp edge there.  I like this glass back.  What happened to carbon fiber, motherfucker?  Well, you'll have a new phone by the end of today, right?  Hello?  My contact?  Please text me, and let me know if I can get a free replacement.  Thank you.  How many iPhones have you gone through?  This would be my seventh iPhone.  Seventh iPhone.  Wow.  Seven iPhones from the first generation. 
[00:04:00]  Let me turn over my archaic BlackBerry so you guys don't make fun of me.  See, when it's upside down, it looks like a fucking state-of-the-art phone, doesn't it?  Let me see that.  Can I see the damage on your iPhone?  I hope you don't throw it.  No one ever gives you anything because you further break it.  That's why I would not ditch it over.  I haven't touched anything in a couple of years in this studio. 
[00:04:30]  And there's a reason for that.  People remember.  I have to look at everything from afar.  It's really frustrating.  I just want to put my hands on a couple things here and there.  People have bumper stickers of a cake with Never Forget on it.  Believe me.  I think we're all on to you at this point.  They still beat me over that stupid cake incident.  That was a stale fucking cake from Starbucks.  But he earned it.  Well, how do you earn a stale cake from Starbucks?  By sitting on your ass all day.  It was on the top of the garbage because they threw it away because it was stale. 
[00:05:00]  But they beat me up to this day over that damn cake incident.  You ever go in that neck of the woods over there where we used to work?  Not really, no.  Up there because I was wondering if any of the old favorites are around.  I know Crazy Lipstick Guy is still there, right?  Well, we're going to film something with Crazy Lipstick Guy.  How is he going to agree to that?  He's the meanest son of a bitch.  The bit's called Homeless Roulette, so you never know what you're going to get.  It's a great new bit I'm doing.  Oh, no. 
[00:05:30]  And me and Bob Kelly searched him out.  When was he in here?  Last week?  We couldn't find him.  He's a mean motherfucker.  I'm setting up Bob Kelly.  We know he's a mean motherfucker.  I go, Bobby, you want to play Homeless Roulette?  Sure.  He's like, dude, I'll film another video with you, dude.  So we went searching because I know that would be, as I like to say a lot, the big get.  The big get, the ringer.  And all of a sudden I'll have my HD flip out and go, oh, how about that guy over there making believe we don't, you know, I don't know him or whatever. 
[00:06:00]  And he'll be attacked by this one.  He wears lipstick and eye shadow and rouge.  He chased us down the road one day.  That was before I started filming, unfortunately.  And if you look at him, and it's just this disgusting homeless guy with women's makeup on.  Right.  He's not trying to be a tranny or anything.  He just puts women's makeup on in his own.  Really bizarre.  And then he gets mad if you try to take a picture of him.  Really?  Or you make a look.  You go, hey, dude, what's with the lipstick? 
[00:06:30]  Ah, don't forget that.  If you said that.  Oh, he would chase you.  You'd be in trouble.  Well, maybe not you.  He would chase me.  He would chase you.  I'd run away from him, though.  Yeah, we couldn't find him, though.  Late last week.  Very scary.  I got to tell you, I'm a huge Mets fan.  No, I'm not really a huge Mets fan.  But I grew up a Mets fan.  And I did something not too smart yesterday.  I thought it was just an innocent little thing.  But the Mets fans coming out of the woodwork to beat the shit out of me.  I went to Yankee Stadium for the first time. 
[00:07:00]  The new stadium.  Ah, yes.  But I have not been to the new city field yet.  I haven't been to the city field.  Last year was the first year for both stadiums.  I did not make it to a baseball game last year.  And, man, people just beat me up that I would go to Yankee Stadium to check out the new stadium.  Why?  It's a big thing to check out.  Goddamn impressive place, I'll tell you.  Yeah, they did a number on that place.  Holy shit.  Isn't that amazing?  I felt like, because I haven't been to Yankee Stadium in many, many years, probably five 
[00:07:30]  or six years easy.  And I felt like I was stepping into the future.  Because if you don't go to a lot of baseball games for that long of a time or whatever,  then you go to the brand new Yankee Stadium.  Like, wow, this is the future.  And this is how they handle baseball now.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, for the regulars that go to baseball games year after year, you don't really,  you just kind of go with the progress.  You know what I mean?  But if all of a sudden you just miss five years and then jump ahead and go to a game,  you realize, wow, they're doing some crazy shit at these baseball games. 
[00:08:00]  That's why I always laugh when someone will be like, you know, the old stadiums are great.  This corporate stadium thing, man.  It's just, you know what?  It's the future.  It's just good.  Yeah.  There are all kinds of things to do in the place.  Well, I was telling you before the show, I now understand why baseball games are four or five hours long.  Yeah.  They want you to be there for the entire day.  Yeah, sure.  You know when they say a day at the ballpark? 
[00:08:30]  They truly mean now a full day at the ballpark.  At one point, I said, hey, I want to check out this stadium.  So we did a whole loop because I wanted to just see everything.  I missed three outs by the time I got back to my seats doing a full fucking circle.  And a lot of other people were doing a full circle.  So, you know, it's slow moving.  I missed three lousy outs.  And I checked out the meat man.  I checked out all the food.  I checked out, well, I didn't check out the museum.  They have a museum.  Yeah. 
[00:09:00]  But the line for the museum was too long.  And I'm looking at these people.  Isn't there a baseball game going on?  Why are you on line for a museum?  But you could do that now.  Nice steakhouse.  Right.  Little restaurants.  Mohegan Sun in the outfield.  Yeah.  You could just hang out outside and have a beer somewhere and watch the game.  I think there was a water slide I passed.  I'm not sure.  I haven't been to Citi Field yet either.  Home of the Mets.  Well, I got to get to Citi Field immediately.  I hear Citi Field is more manageable. 
[00:09:30]  That's what Mets fans are calling it.  More manageable?  Yeah.  Like Yankee Stadium is way over the top compared to Citi Field.  There's a lot of shit.  Yeah.  They kept there just baseball?  I don't know.  I haven't been there.  Yeah.  I'll have a full report because I'll get my ass over there within the next week or two.  Because now I got to check out Citi Field as well.  You mean the one the game that shouldn't have won Mets?  The what happened?  The one the game where they shouldn't have won Mets.  It was a bad call at the plate. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, the Giants?  Yeah.  My Giants got screwed by the Mets.  Giants clearly won over the Mets yesterday.  Dave in Pennsylvania.  I did not know this.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  You did see that game yesterday, Opie?  I did not.  No.  I'm not.  I saw the clip.  I don't watch a lot of baseball games anymore.  I can't make believe I do.  Yeah.  What happened there, Dave?  It was 3-1.  Mets were leading going into the bottom of the ninth.  Giants come to bat. 
[00:10:30]  Ended getting two runners on.  Got a base hit.  Scored two runs.  Tied it 3-3.  There was a runner on third for the Giants.  One out.  There was an infield hit.  And the third baseman hit through the ball to the home plate.  And it was a real high throw.  The runner got under the tag.  Just touched home plate.  Then the catcher touched the runner there.  And the umpire called him safe. 
[00:11:00]  I'm sorry.  Called him out.  Yeah, called him out.  But he was clearly safe.  They showed it over and over.  That was it.  So they went into extra innings.  And the Mets wound up scoring.  And they won the game.  It was such a bad call.  It's a weird.  There were so many bad calls in the ninth and the tenth inning between the pitches.  And just umpires just suck.  Man, why can't they go to an instant replay for that?  I love this.  It's like, wow, quite the call.  This guy would make a great announcer.  No kidding.  They're goofing on you, sir. 
[00:11:30]  It's been a weird year for baseball.  I think they bring the instant replay in next year.  Because a lot of shit's going wrong this year.  Dude, they are so fucking against the instant replay.  That is true.  Look at this.  Look at this.  The high throw.  Oh, my God.  He was so safe.  He's safe.  The ump was in a bad position there.  Do they have the slow-mo?  You don't even need it.  I know.  You don't even really need the slow motion.  Oh, it's not even close.  Yeah.  His leg was so far across home plate. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, here you go.  Here's a better shot at it for a who gives a shit game.  Oh, that was closer than I thought.  You know, though, he's safe.  Yeah, but that was closer than I thought from that angle.  Oh, here's a...  Oh, no.  He's so safe.  He's so fucking safe.  All right.  Because it looked like his bent leg was the one that touched the plate.  But it was his straight leg that touched the plate first.  So, yeah.  Wow.  Fuck it.  This guy wants to tell it correctly. 
[00:12:30]  Angelo from Staten Island.  What's up, boys?  Hey, we just saw the replay, so I don't know if we even need you.  But what do you want to add?  The umpire is a retard.  That's the same retarded umpire that when the Yankees were playing Minnesota and it hit  the guy in the foot and it was totally foul that he called it a fair ball.  That's the same umpire, number one.  Number two, the call last night, he even admitted after the game that he thought his foot was  over the base but didn't touch home plate.  Oh, okay. 
[00:13:00]  So it swept...  He said it was over it.  He said it did not touch it.  That's why he was out.  Oh, that's crazy.  It didn't even look like the catcher made the tag either.  It looks like he came right behind his back.  It's pretty amazing.  He came behind his back.  Long!  Long!  Long!  It's too early for that, man.  How great.  We go to MLB.com and we just saw ten different angles of that one lousy play.  I know.  One lousy fucking play there.  It's the future.  It is the future.  Love the intratubes.  But very impressed with Yankee Stadium. 
[00:13:30]  Not impressed with the $15 steak sandwich that we bought, by the way.  They have a steak sandwich over there.  Someone's got to pay the A-Rod salary.  Come on.  What are you doing?  I tweeted a picture of Meat Man.  Yeah.  And then they carve up this meat nice and then I guess it's a $15 fucking sandwich.  It was good.  It wasn't worth $15 fucking dollars.  Got any bourbon in it or nothing?  Then nothing.  $15 sandwich.  And then what's up with the seats at Yankee Stadium?  You know about them in the front.  They're like $1,500 a seat or something like that. 
[00:14:00]  But you get everything.  They just take care of you the whole game.  Oh, the waitstaff and everything?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But it comes with the price of your ticket.  They're great.  And then the seats are pretty thin because they just can't get that section sold out every game.  So when you're watching the games on TV,  it looks like no one's at the fucking stadium.  Yeah, with the economy the way it is, you know, toward the end of the season,  especially if the Yankees are doing good, you'll see that fill up.  But it is amazing that you just sit there and you don't got to get up. 
[00:14:30]  Right.  You do not have to fucking get up.  They come by, whatever you want, place your order, and you get it.  But the only thing you have to do at that point is tip because everything comes with the price of the seat.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Then I also learned they have $5 seats at Yankee Stadium.  $5 seats.  For certain games and you can sit way the fuck up and then check out a game for $5?  And just be there.  Be there to experience the magic.  That's really nice of them.  Yeah, that is nice of them to shove you in the cosmos. 
[00:15:00]  For $5.  There are seats at the park that just aren't worth, like, just watch it at home.  Just watch it at home.  But who gets to sit way high up in the sky?  I was thinking if you're not a huge fan, that that would be a cool experience to go check out a $5 seat  and just look at the cosmos for $4 or $5.  Yeah, just sit and look up.  This is great.  I'm high.  Realize how small they look down below in the field.  It would be a good experience, no? 
[00:15:30]  We could spit on people and just go, ha-ha, suckers, better luck next time.  It's really nice of the Yankees to offer, you know, $5 seats to the real fans.  And then you get in the place.  And, of course, you know, after parking, getting a couple waters.  How much does that $5 seat cost you?  Exactly.  And that's why they do it.  They're not stupid.  Yeah.  They got you in the place, and now you got all this stuff to check out for four or five hours.  Bought a couple of $15 sandwiches.  Right, exactly.  Yeah, five bucks.  I guarantee the average $5 seat ends up costing you easily $50. 
[00:16:00]  Hell, yeah.  By the time it's all said and done.  Let's go to MJ in Manhattan.  MJ.  Good morning, boys.  Hey, man.  Hey, yo, the new stadium is awesome, man.  Awesome.  Stank houses.  All crazy stuff.  But something so simple like Baskin Robbins.  The line's a half mile long.  I ended up missing a Yankees rally.  I ain't ride home because I'm standing on the line for a fucking Sunday.  Yeah, that was a little weird because it seemed like they had a lot of places to eat, but  there were a lot of long lines. 
[00:16:30]  A lot of fucking people.  And especially the ice cream line because, you know, what was it, 100 degrees yesterday,  something like that?  People want their ice cream.  And I saw these people.  They were just in line forever.  Yeah.  You're right, MJ.  Can you see the walls and check out George's box this weekend?  I don't have that set up.  I'm sorry, sir.  George's box.  Box.  And right in front of Yankee Stadium, they had the lamest memorial to Bob Shepard I've  ever seen.  The guy gave his life. 
[00:17:00]  And you know how when, like, Lady Di died or something or some fucking famous person,  they'd throw down the candles and the flowers and the pictures.  Oh, yeah.  Giant.  And some dude threw his Yankee cap down.  That obviously was a lame-ass fucking promotional Yankee cap.  It wasn't even one of the good ones.  And it's just sitting there, and everyone's taking pictures of this thing.  Yeah.  I should have fucking taken a picture.  It was so lame.  Right in front of, you know, Yankee Stadium.  Yeah, that's pretty bad.  Remembering Bob Shepard, their PA announcer for, I don't know, 85 years, whatever he did. 
[00:17:30]  That no one cares about because George died.  George's box is unavailable.  It's six feet underground.  Oh.  I can't see the game from there.  That's Danny there.  Very good.  You got a comfy satin pillow.  Let's go to Derek, our intern in Staten Island.  Derek.  Hey, what's up, boys?  You know those seats you were talking about, those presidential seats, the ones that are  all the way by the front?  Yeah, what are they called, though?  I think they call them the presidential.  No, I don't think that's the name.  There might be city, though.  I don't remember what the Yankee stadiums called them. 
[00:18:00]  Something with a probably like premier or presidential.  Yeah.  And I know towards the end of the season, the Steinbrenner family and management, they  give the seats out to VIPs just to fill that section up so it doesn't look like it's  so empty.  But the problem is VIPs don't use their seats, so they would have to give them to the regular  fucking fans if they want.  They would give it to the regular fans.  They look at the regular fans like we're peasants.  I don't know.  They offer $5 seats for you guys.  They'd probably give them to celebrities and stuff and go, hey, come on down. 
[00:18:30]  We'd like to see your face back there, you know?  But if your team, I mean, the Yankees aren't going to be out of it, but if your team's out  of it, why would you go to the ballpark late in the year to sit in those seats?  For a $4,000 sandwich or beer.  That's true.  Let me say hi to Tony in Jersey.  Tony!  Tony.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, yeah?  So, you know, those seats that are down, they changed it from last year.  They used to be called legend seats.  And they used to go from all the way from first to all over to third baseline. 
[00:19:00]  What they did was they broke it up, and now they have championship seats and legend seats.  The legends go from the dugout to dugout, including home plate.  They range from $900 to $1,100 per seat.  Jesus.  Now, you get the only, I believe it's either four or five diamond restaurant of any ballpark  in the country.  Big deal.  It does include all your food and your soft drinks, including water, but not alcohol. 
[00:19:30]  So, you still have to pay $15 a beer.  Wait, so they can't throw the alcohol in?  Oh.  That's ridiculous.  Probably some kind of law, yeah.  Oh, you think it's a law?  That they can't give away.  But if you're paying $1,100 per seat?  Yeah, you would think it's included.  You can't drink $1,100 worth of alcohol in one game.  No, and so the seats right next to the dugout, there's a Giuliani seat, so $1,100.  Right.  And actually, they go up in price depending on your row.  So, like, if you were sitting, let's say, right by DeShara, you know, down the first baseline 
[00:20:00]  and with the full championship seats, the first row is $550.  The second row is $350.  Why?  Because you're in the first row, man.  That's what a Yankee boy is.  Yeah, but second row is just as good in that situation.  Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.  Kenny's in front of you.  No, it's all right.  No, but here's what really is annoying.  If you're in the old stadium and a lot of the ballparks, before the game, batting practice, 
[00:20:30]  you can go down, hang out by the dugout.  You know, kids can try to, like, you know, maybe see one of the stars, maybe get an autograph  or something, but at least be part of the experience.  Now, in Yankee Stadium, if you don't have legend seats, you cannot go down for batting practice.  Oh, man.  That used to be the coolest thing when I was growing up.  We couldn't afford the good seats, but we went early to the game down to batting practice  to check out everyone close up.  Yeah, they will not let anybody in that section if you do not pay between $912 a seat. 
[00:21:00]  You know, that's just a bad design for the stadium.  They should have figured that out.  Yeah.  Because the batting practice thing was always a tradition for kids.  You know, run down there and check shit out.  Ah, for the kids.  For the kids, maybe get an autograph.  Maybe one of these stars will give you a look.  But I'll tell you another secret.  I mean, not a very secret, but something you could, you know, I've been doing, is StubHub. 
[00:21:30]  They're, like, the reseller of, uh...  Sure, yeah, yeah.  StubHub!  What the Yankees have been doing is, for the seats that haven't been purchased, they put  them up on StubHub, and they cure their pricing, meaning that they'll start offering, let's  say, you know, a seat right behind a home plate for $1,100 at face value.  And as it gets closer to the game, they come down.  So, depending on the game, you could actually buy one of those seats for, like, $300, $400.  Right on.  I'd sell my fucking legend seats because of you, you cunt! 
[00:22:00]  Those are my legend seats!  Mel's packing up and leaving.  That's the latest.  That's a rumor.  Oh, really?  It's a rumor.  Thanks for the call, brother.  I appreciate it.  Okay, we'll see you later, Micah.  You know, I can't trash Yankee Stadium.  I was blown away how nice that fucking place is.  Hey!  I'm not going to become a Yankee fan or anything like that, but, wow, that's a hell of a ballpark, 
[00:22:30]  man.  They really did a great job.  Yeah.  And could the police, and you know we're big fans of the police, maybe Ann's not going  to agree with me, but stop busting the guys selling water going into the stadium.  Poor fucking guy is selling water for a dollar a bottle, and you got guys riding him up.  Just leave him alone.  I hate those guys that sell water on the side of the road.  It's nice when you get off the fucking subway, and you're fucking dying.  I'd take the D-Train uptown, Ann. 
[00:23:00]  D-Train.  Because their hands are wet, and then you know they're dirty, and then the water from  the condensation drips and hits the cap.  And even though it's sealed, it's like you take the cap off, and now his filthy hand  water, there's still some shit going on there.  You take the cap off, and then you wipe it on your shirt a little bit.  Do a little fucking ring around the fucking lid and start drinking.  Maybe for dust that's good, but I'll tell you, for the disgusting hand shit. 
[00:23:30]  I actually felt bad for these guys.  They were getting written up, and I'm thinking, if you find yourself in a position where you're  selling water for a dollar a bottle, and it's 100 degrees out, and you only have, I don't  know, maybe like 24 bottles, because you can't carry anymore.  So I'm thinking, they're only taking in 24 lousy dollars.  They had to pay for the water, whatever their cost was.  It's like, why don't you leave these poor guys alone? 
[00:24:00]  Small profit margin.  Who are they really hurting in the end?  Poor fucks.  I think it's a bigger conspiracy.  I think it's a big...  You think it's one main guy?  I think it's a main guy, and he comes by and keeps delivering more water to those  guys.  Sell them, motherfucker.  That's not a...  Sell it.  They're just the dealers.  Yeah, yeah.  And then you have to go up, and there's some big water kingpin somewhere who's supplying  this.  I actually saw...  I actually saw...  He's just drinking right out of a five-gallon jug.  I was too lazy yesterday.  I should have taken more pictures, because I actually saw the kingpin of water. 
[00:24:30]  I know you're joking about it, but this guy had so much fucking water around him.  I'm like, how did you get all this water on the sidewalk?  Just piles and piles.  And then as you got close to the stadium, it was the little guy with like, you know,  12 bottles here, 20 bottles over here.  One guy had just a little Coleman cooler he was selling water out of.  Never fuck me with my water, Tony.  Never fuck me.  Take it to the limit. 
[00:25:00]  Limit!  There's just water being poured.  Tony Montana, in the montage, is just drinking water.  Yeah, they're talking about water.  Laughing at each other with giant jugs of water.  A close-up of like hands putting ice into a glass.  The money just going through the machine, but it's only like eight bucks.  Right.  It's worn out dollar bills.  Yeah.  Just a few.  They're backstroking in the water. 
[00:25:30]  Trucks leaving BJ's Wholesale Club.  Yeah.  Six stacks of water, man.  But I was thinking, too.  You know what?  Fuck those guys.  You know what?  I'm with the NYPD after all.  Fuck those guys.  Because if they're selling the water for a dollar, they had to have stolen it from somewhere.  You have to think.  The profit margin is zero.  Because I'm looking like, only a dollar for a big fucking water as you're walking into the stadium?  That's a bargain.  Of course.  That fell off the truck somewhere.  You think?  Yeah.  It was some kind of illegal.  Something illegal went on there. 
[00:26:00]  The water kingpin.  I like that.  I think I saw that guy, though.  The water kingpin.  And a few of the locals, because I wasn't brave enough to make comments.  They're like, a few of the locals are like, you think you have enough water?  You think you got enough water?  The fuck is that about?  And I just walked by.  I'll leave the water guy alone.  Don't look at anybody.  Just focus on the stadium.  You'll get there.  You'll get there in one piece.  Now, the margin's better than you think, because you can get a case of water for nine bucks.  Okay.  And it's $35 to a case. 
[00:26:30]  So that's $35.  So then $9, let's call it.  So you're a $26 profit.  Per case?  Per case.  And I'll sell three cases?  But what about the guy that only had, like, fucking 24?  And he gets asked out.  That was a sad fucking sight.  And is it Poland Spring, or do they sell that Aquarius shit smell water?  I do notice that today, the Poland Spring is bountiful in the studio.  Making a big comeback right here.  We appreciate that.  Aquarius water indeed.  And then I finally gave in, because then I had to take the D train back downtown. 
[00:27:00]  Me doing subways, and, you know.  Of course.  It's the easiest way, actually, to get there.  And I finally broke down, and I grabbed one of the waters from one of these guys right,  you know, at the top of the subway.  And I get lukewarm water guy.  I'm like, fuck.  I passed a hundred of these guys where you see the ice just dripping off the fucking water.  And I get the nervous guy at the top of the subway steps praying that he doesn't get busted  trying to make a lousy ten bucks.  He's sitting in the sun, his stupid water, sitting there in the sun all day. 
[00:27:30]  He's all nervous like he's selling coke.  I'm like, it's fucking water.  Relax.  Calm down, fucker.  His eyes are darting from left to right over a lousy bottle of water.  You don't want to get busted.  So I felt sorry for the guy, so I gave him two bucks for a bottle of water.  I said, fuck, here's two fucking dollars.  Because I saw he only had like eight left, and then it was lukewarm.  I'm like, you motherfucker.  I hate when you give someone, like, extra money just to get fucked over.  It's not a lot of fun. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, whatever.  But a very good experience at the stadium yesterday.  That sounds like fun.  Nice day.  You Yankee fans are very, very fortunate.  Yeah.  Now I've got to get to Citi Field to check out what my old team's up to.  Well, the weather's going to be very nice the next few days.  Yeah.  Again, we talk about this every year, but I can't stand it on the news, the weather.  A man gets up there and just starts talking about, you know, when is this heat wave going to end?  We'll let you know.  I know a lot of people want relief from this. 
[00:28:30]  No.  It's summer.  If it's hot for three days in a row, they freak out like everyone's dropping dead and crying about the heat.  I'm a guy, I agree with you.  I mean, I'm a guy that just goes with the weather.  Like, in the winter, I love when it gets fucking cold and shitty and, you know.  I don't mind a snowstorm.  And I don't mind the heat wave.  I don't like freezing cold with nothing else but just bitter wind.  Like, if it's snowing and shit, that's fun. 
[00:29:00]  Hate bitter cold wind.  I love those days because then you don't feel guilty just hanging in doors all fucking day watching movies.  I don't feel guilty doing that anyway.  Yeah, I'm one of those guys, though.  If it's sunny out, I feel guilty just, you know, killing a day inside.  Oh, my God.  I didn't even go out yesterday.  I opened the sliding glass door and stood in front of the screen and went, wow, it's warm out, and then shut the door.  That was it?  I didn't set foot outside my house.  That means you had a great Saturday. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, Saturday was a party.  Wait, you didn't go outside yesterday?  No.  Why?  You got the pool and everything.  It was a party on Saturday.  So yesterday was just kind of a mellow out day.  A recover day?  Recover.  Why don't you recover by the pool?  I don't really need much recovery.  I wasn't that, which is weird because you would think.  They had that softball game there in Eisenhower Park.  Right.  A bunch of fans.  I didn't even know about it.  Get together and do that.  I think we're not connected to the fans right now.  I had a Twitter thing. 
[00:30:00]  I didn't even know about it.  I heard about it.  Up to the last second.  I heard about it.  I actually was in Philly, but I would have fucking, yeah.  And Eisenhower Park is.  It was not far from my house.  So I'm like, fuck it.  You know, I hop in the truck.  I take a drive down there and the game was over, but then it's time for the barbecue and  all kinds of other shit.  So hanging out.  It was cool.  And then I guess they also do this raffle and they're giving away gift certificates,  $25 gift certificates to FH Riley's.  Oh, really? 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Does my brother know about that?  I have no idea, but they guilted me into buying some tickets.  And then I'm like, could you see me eating a meal at FH Riley's and then handing them  over a gift certificate?  Like, I wouldn't get shit on.  It's like, yeah, Anthony came down.  Motherfucker, like, pays with a gift certificate.  That would be great, man.  So they were supposed to go down to FH after we all hung out there. 
[00:31:00]  It started getting a little dark.  We played some poker.  You know, it was fun.  And then...  Was there an actual game?  Yeah, yeah.  They played a game.  They played a full softball game.  I got there after the softball game.  But yeah, plenty of beers.  It was a good time.  It was a nice day.  I see that one hanging out a lot lately.  Who?  Just that one.  Oh, Melinda?  Yeah.  Yeah, she's cold.  She's hanging out a lot lately.  She was there with her boyfriend.  Oh, really?  With a boyfriend.  Okay.  No, that's cool.  Wow, wait.  Nice boobies. 
[00:31:30]  Who the hell is that?  Big A looks like he's wearing...  I know.  Big A showed up with long shorts that came down below his knees.  He's wearing black sneakers that look like black dress shoes.  Looks like El Duche.  Right.  It looks like he's wearing fireman boots.  Because then he's got black socks pulled up.  And you can't...  So you can't distinguish where the sock ends and the sneaker begins.  I was going to say, you can't figure out where the calf is and the ankle is.  That's why it looks like he's wearing giant boots. 
[00:32:00]  I know the old joke is cankles, but Big A's got the definition of cankles.  That's why people were taking pictures.  His calves are giant, hugely fat calves.  It's stunning how giant his calves are.  And so then afterwards, everyone was going to go to FH Riley's.  But apparently under renovation.  Yeah, man.  My brother's redoing the entire place.  He was supposed to be open by now.  I've got to call him and see what's up. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, the old FH.  I'm getting a little nervous for him.  Under renovation.  Check out the new joint.  Was my brother there?  No, I didn't see him.  I've been a very long time.  I wonder how he's doing.  So I decide, after a couple of beers, I go, you know something?  Fuck this.  Everyone, come on over.  Come on over to the house.  We'll have a pool party.  Wow, you were lonely this weekend.  I just figured, you know what?  Why not?  Why not?  I got plenty of booze.  I had plenty of beers. 
[00:33:00]  I got the pool.  There were some big-titted animals.  Show me a picture of a big-titted animal.  There was some big-titted animal.  It was down there.  And I just figured, you know, why not?  Everybody come down.  So everybody came down, had a big party.  Is that a big-titted animal?  No, there was some...  There's another one.  No, don't point at the guys, Danny.  That's wood floor liquor.  He's a good soldier. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  That wood floor liquor.  There's that guy that can never find sleeves.  It's like Steve 2.  Every fucking picture of this motherfucker.  You can't fucking wear a sleeve.  Look, I've got to look at my tats.  Look, check out my full sleeve.  Full sleeves are in.  I just fucking can't stop people like that.  I'm in the middle of getting a full sleeve.  Oh, shit.  So then, yeah, we had the...  There's no fucking big-titted monsters.  No, there were.  See, it's a big A.  No, there were.  There's no real pictures of them there.  I don't know why. 
[00:34:00]  I think it was if I took a picture with one that was kind of...  Did you force all the girls to remove all their clothes before they walked into the compound?  Not force, but everything is, you know, open.  Yes.  Well, there were three people there that I said, make sure they don't come.  Oh, who was on the...  Three people were on the do not show list.  You are not invited.  Everyone else was allowed to come and showed up.  But was it like you guys were whispering, like, party at Anthony's, but don't tell those three?  Or did they openly know they weren't allowed? 
[00:34:30]  I pretty much said, I don't want those three at my house.  All right.  One was Bobo.  Bobo showed up.  Bobo.  I did not want Bobo at my house.  Oh, Bobo.  The second one, Stalker Patty.  But she's been around for 12 years.  Dude, don't care.  Did not need her fucking...  Oh, this is wonderful.  All that crap.  Okay.  And the third, the creepiest man that walks the face of the earth, crazed from the Ron 
[00:35:00]  and Fez show.  He...  I'm watching him look at the girls.  He looks with this out of the corner of his eye.  He should just walk around with a giant red virtual thumbtack for sexual predator.  Where no matter where he is, it's just like on a Google map.  There should really just be an app that tells you where he is at all times.  Where he is.  Maybe that dot could just be on a baseball hat.  Yeah, yeah.  Just put it on a big dot.  Because I think it would be tiring to carry his own dot above his head. 
[00:35:30]  And he's sat on a stick.  You could just see crazed.  Yeah.  He was looking...  You can't describe...  His name is called Crazed.  The creepiness of his eyes when he's looking at a girl...  Like, girls will be talking...  There was one point where, like, three girls are hanging out, and they're feeling how heavy  another girl's tit is.  And it was fun.  We're all standing there, like, sitting on the picnic table, watching, snapping some pictures.  Crazed comes over.  And broke the whole fucking thing up.  The girls, like, walked away.  The guy creeped out.  And we're all standing there.  And then Crazed is standing where the girls were. 
[00:36:00]  And we're just looking at Crazed now, going, oh, good one.  Thanks, Crazed.  Just his eyes fucking frightened people.  Scared him away.  If Crazed is listening, I'm a huge fan of yours.  Oh, Jesus.  He's a fucking lunatic.  Well, that's why I'm a huge fan of his.  I don't want any problems.  I don't want any problems with Crazed.  And then Spandy was there, too.  Yeah.  Who?  Spandy, the guy that gets on Pal Talk every so often in spandex and does shit with his 
[00:36:30]  dick.  Even I know about Spandy.  Yeah, yeah.  I've heard of him.  Sure.  Yeah, Spandy was there.  Very cool.  Sounds like you had a good time.  So you brought them all back to the compound?  Yeah, they came back to the compound.  And then...  Did they start touching everything?  No.  Everyone was really cool.  I have the keg out in the cabana now, also.  Nice.  That ran out.  That keg's empty, by the way, Danny.  Can you imagine that?  Are you guys going through a keg a week?  Could be two.  Two a week?  With the way the parties have been going, there's been a lot of people over the house. 
[00:37:00]  Two kegs a week.  A lot of people over the house recently.  Wow.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  So everybody was really cool.  No one fucked with anything.  It was a good time.  And then the next day, it's Sunday.  Yeah, but when did Saturday end for you?  Did you see the blue sky coming up?  No blue sky, dude.  Did you make it to blue sky?  No, no, made it to blue sky, and then just brought daylight.  Wow.  How many people were left when the sun came up?  Maybe five, six people. 
[00:37:30]  Now, let me ask you this, and it's all in the backyard, obviously, because why would you  be inside, or do you move it inside eventually?  No, actually, we did do poker and then karaoke, and then all went back outside again.  At what time did you go back outside?  Maybe seven in the morning, and then stayed out there until about 8.30.  Dude, your neighbors have got to fucking hate you.  Ah, what are they going to do?  Do they knock on your door ever and go, nope.  They don't call the police ever?  Petrified of Anthony.  That's awesome.  They wouldn't say a word, and it's, you know, it's Saturday.  Because they don't know what you really do for a living, right? 
[00:38:00]  No, they don't.  They just know you come and go at really weird hours, and you're an Italian guy getting into  an Escalade.  They're not going to fuck with you.  I'm a guinea going into an Escalade, and I sit on the back table every so often and  just clean, giant weapons.  I mean, no one knows what I'm doing back there.  You think they're taking a peek when you leave at 4.30, 5 o'clock in the morning?  He's leaving again.  I leave early, and then they must look also and go, and then he comes home so early. 
[00:38:30]  Right.  What does this fucking idiot do?  You should just throw a shovel in the back of Escalade every morning.  Just one lousy word.  Some line.  Yeah, just some fucking...  How can you guys pretend like there's no such thing as Google?  Like they don't know what his last name is, and they could just punch it.  Yeah, that's true.  You know what?  You'd be surprised.  I mean, you know, people our age especially, they're just not on top of the technology.  I hang out with old friends here and there, and they got really old phones.  I'm like, what's wrong with you fucking guys? 
[00:39:00]  Yep.  You would think they would, Danny, but you'd be surprised.  Most people just don't.  I'll go with you on that one.  A friend of mine yesterday, he wanted some help with something.  He doesn't have a computer, but he's got a phone, and he's like, oh, I want to post  something.  He's like, but I got to get to a computer.  I'm like, you have a smartphone in your pocket, you retard.  Just take it out and go to the web.  It's right there in your pocket.  And he's like, oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  People just don't get it sometimes.  So the fans loved the compound and hanging out?  They had fun.  Everybody had a good time. 
[00:39:30]  No one fucked with anything.  I didn't want those lunatics over there, though, the three.  And Bobo is just, I didn't watch him play softball, but he played.  But apparently he, when he swings a bat, it looks just like Wendy swinging the bat.  Oh, in The Shining?  Jack Torrance.  Yeah.  He can't, like, get a swing, so it looks all choppy and weird, and he just strikes out  constantly. 
[00:40:00]  And then he's sitting at the picnic table with that perfect seated posture that he does,  with his hands on his legs, and for an hour.  And then I go, so I go, Bobo, because I got knocked out of the poker game at one point,  and they were still playing.  So I go, Bobo, I go, somebody over there wanted you to play poker, and there's a seat open.  He goes, I got no buddy.  He goes, no, they're footing the bill for you.  Oh, and then we see him get up and start walking over there, and I'm just like, oh, 
[00:40:30]  they're going to be so mad.  They're just going to yell at him and throw him away.  And that's what they did.  Like, get the fuck out of here, Bobo.  It was so mean.  That's great.  God, we embraced the lunatic.  I love it.  One of the radio shows embraces the lunatic.  It was fun.  Goddamn, good goddamn time.  But then, yes, Sunday at about, I guess, 2.30, I hear my front door open, and I hear, hello? 
[00:41:00]  And it's Keith and Ange.  Just coming over?  On a Sunday morning, though.  And then I hear Keith go, holy shit.  And Ange's like, this was just cleaned.  Because, you know, you have a party.  It's going to be shit laying out.  It's going to be a little messy.  And, you know, and then they start talking about, you know, because they know everyone  that I know, and who's in town and out of town, and how could I be having a party when  this one isn't around or that one?  Because I just spurred the moment, decided, fuck it, I'm having a party.  Right on, man. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Good for you.  Now clean it up!  Sounds like you had a good weekend.  Yeah, it was fun.  Great weekend.  A lot of fun.  I have a kid, so I don't have any real weekend stories.  I stay in a lot, so.  Oh, Jesus.  I got out for a Yankee game, and it was terrific.  Well, that's nice.  Hanging out with some old friends.  What did you do?  You left the wife at home?  Yeah, she's cool.  Yeah?  Yeah.  She gets mad at me, though, because, you know, then she wants to go do stuff, and I go,  yeah, I'll babysit the kid.  She goes, it's your kid.  You're not babysitting.  You can't babysit your kid. 
[00:42:00]  You're not babysitting.  But I go, yeah, I have no problem babysitting for a few hours.  She goes, will you stop saying babysit?  You're watching your son.  Yeah.  It's not babysitting at that point.  Which I'm loving more and more every day.  Just having a kid thing is fucking, I know people.  Yeah, better than a puppy?  It's way better than a fucking puppy.  Yeah?  What about a monkey?  Monkeys would fun.  That's a rough one.  A monkey with a little engineer hat and overalls?  I don't know if I'd want to.  Cute as a button.  I don't know if I would want to change a monkey's diaper, though. 
[00:42:30]  Nah.  That would be a little rough.  I'd throw the shit at you, too.  That would be a little rough.  You're probably right.  Monkey astronaut was my favorite.  Look at the little guy.  He don't know where he's going.  Stupid monkey.  I think I was in Bizarro World yesterday, too, because, uh, all right, I'll throw myself  under the bus for a second.  I wear a Bjorn now with the kid.  I'm that guy.  What?  I think it's called a Bjorn, if you want to look it up.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait, wait.  No, it's like, it's like, sort of like, uh, the front backpack. 
[00:43:00]  Hold, hold on.  See if...  No, you don't.  See...  I have to wait a minute.  No, you don't.  And I would tweet pictures and all, but my kid really is a civilian.  I don't want him in the spotlight, spotlight, like other people's kids around here.  So, but...  You, oh, there it is.  Yeah, I'm that guy.  No, no, you're not.  Yeah, I'm that guy.  No!  That's the exact one I fucking use, too.  My kid loves it.  And I love it.  Oh, no. 
[00:43:30]  But...  Oh.  I'm that guy.  Have I showed you that picture back in 95?  What?  Have I showed you that picture back in 95?  Oh, I know.  Oh, trust me.  I'd be all over it.  Yeah, I'm that guy.  Oh, God.  No, my kid faces outward, though, because he's big enough already.  Yeah, I'm that guy.  I walk around the neighborhood like that.  And I used to make fun of those guys.  When it's the, it's, you know, he gets to check shit out in the neighborhood.  Wow.  But I'm in the supermarket yesterday, and it was kind of an awkward moment because it was 
[00:44:00]  a meeting of the shock jocks.  I'm in the supermarket with my kid in front.  You know, I'm wearing the Bjorn.  The Bjorn.  And we're doing a little shopping.  Shock shopping?  Good old Fred Norris, you know, stops.  Oh, yeah.  You know, we shop at the same supermarket.  And now I'm like, oh, this is awkward.  I got my new kid.  I got a Bjorn.  I must look like the biggest fucking dork.  I'm wild.  Right.  But honestly, every time I see Fred Norris, it has to be said. 
[00:44:30]  And I don't think we've ever trashed him personally.  He's like the fucking nicest guy.  Hung out for like five, five minutes just talking about his kids, my kid, this, that,  blah, blah, blah.  Couldn't have been nicer.  Yeah, Fred's great.  You know what?  I'm at the point now, and I don't hold grudges for very long.  I don't mind anyone over at that end of the hallway.  We're all in the same fucking boat in this motherfucking place.  Some people have giant cruise ships. 
[00:45:00]  Others have rowboats.  But we're all in the same ocean here.  I got no problem.  Robin got on the elevator the other day, and we were talking, and she's cool as shit.  She's really cool and stuff.  So you know what?  I just, too many years have gone by.  I don't care anymore.  I just don't care to argue anymore.  I learned that Baba Booey's got us on his preset.  You know, it's all good around here, obviously.  It's fine, whatever.  As he gives us dirty looks, really.  Keep listening to our show, Baba Booey. 
[00:45:30]  No, I don't have problems with anybody.  Even he's been fine.  He's a fucking dick.  I see him in the elevator.  I got no problem with Gary.  I'm a little behind you.  I like most of them.  I like most of the guys.  Well, you hold a grudge like the fucking anti-defamation league.  Well, the guy continues to give dirty looks, and then I got some fucking intel that there  we are on his fucking preset in his office.  So I guess we can't be that bad, right, Gary?  We rule.  Can't be that bad if you got us on one of your presets on your stupid fucking radio. 
[00:46:00]  Yes, Danny?  Well, I don't mean to go back to the Baby Bjorn thing.  Oh, yeah.  Go ahead.  But I'm having a hard time.  Like, when I used to have a Blackberry, I used to have a holster, and I would wear it  on my belt.  And I can't tell you how many times I would smash that thing into a door jam.  Like, how do you walk around with a baby strapped to your stomach?  You're using a baby as your bumper.  Well, I horrified someone at the supermarket yesterday.  An old man fucking freaked out, and he helped me because I'm trying to figure out. 
[00:46:30]  I'm glad you brought that up.  I buy the huge waters going back to water guy.  I buy the, I don't know, I guess.  You're him.  I guess it's a, maybe I'm the fucking water kingpin.  You're the water kingpin.  But I think it's like a 30, it must be the 30 pack that it's got some good weight.  And I usually get two of them at the supermarket, and I got water for the next couple weeks.  I was trying to lift this thing with a kid in front of me.  Oh, dude, you can't do that.  And I'm like, wow, you can't really lift these things when you can't lift them close 
[00:47:00]  to your body.  Yeah, because you kind of use your body to hold it up also.  So now I'm struggling, and now the water's getting dangerously close to squishing my own  kid, an old man drops everything horrified and just, oh, I'll grab that for you.  And he's sacrificing a heart attack to get my water in my cart because he couldn't believe  what he was looking at.  Put it this way.  Put it this way.  I went to open my car door yesterday, and I opened it straight into my shin.  I can't have a baby strapped to the front of my body. 
[00:47:30]  That's never going to happen for me.  You really bring up a good point.  And what happens if you just fucking fall?  Because you leave with your baby.  Huh?  What happens if you trip?  I've tripped and fallen right on my stomach.  Well, I'm not drinking while I'm fucking...  All right, that's a good point.  You know, you bring up a valid point.  Although I'm extremely clumsy, so...  Yeah, you lead with your baby, though, which is really strange.  Lead with your baby.  Right.  God, that's fucking rough.  I am wearing that, though.  And I don't mind it. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  That's fatherhood.  Although I do pull my hat way down, and I have sunglasses on.  Maybe I do mind.  Maybe there's something going on there.  That's a fucking idea.  All right, you want to take our first break?  Yeah, I want to eat.  Hey, man, OP Radio on YouTube, you guys were begging for them.  I got the last two Mel Gibson remixes up.  The Two Bar and Norton's Mom.  I think they're my two favorite ones, and they're up there for your listening pleasure.  Those are great.  You want to play one of them going into break? 
[00:48:30]  Certainly.  I know we're kind of fading out of the Mel Gibson stuff, but we could get a couple of  these on today.  People still love them.  Which one do you want, Two Bar or Norton's Mom?  Oh, God.  Norton's Mom?  Norton's Mom is great.  Hi, sweetheart.  It's Mom.  I know this is a little awkward, but everyone's fine here, but we heard the radio show.  We love it, by the way.  What the fuck?  What are you going to say?  You're talking about giving up, you know, ladies of the evening.  What the fuck do you hope you'll accomplish with that? 
[00:49:00]  I deserve to be blown.  I spent more than five million dollars.  But you know what?  Dr. Phil always says replace something with something.  How dare you?  So I was thinking, you know, you have that nice gym downstairs.  What?  What?  You could exercise, and you would feel a whole lot better.  You'd lose a little weight.  You'd tone up.  You fucking offended me.  I don't know, honey.  I just thought it might be a good thing.  I'm sorry.  I'm interfering, I know.  I just, I'm thinking of you. 
[00:49:30]  Nobody knows I'm calling.  You know right now.  You don't care about anyone but yourself.  It's you.  Don't get offended or think I'm strange, but I am a mother, and I worry about you.  Look at yourself, and look what you've done.  You fucking excuse for a mother.  It would help you, sweetheart.  Well, anyway, that's it.  I'm not going to go on.  I know it's not my business.  But anyway, I love you, and I feel I can interfere because I'm your mother.  I'm taking a special license. 
[00:50:00]  Anyway, don't be mad at me, okay, sweetie?  I love you.  Thanks.  Talk to you soon.  Bye-bye.  The Virus, Sirius XM.  This is the Opinion 3 Show.  Opinion 3.  Look who's back.  Patrice O'Neill helping us out today.  Oh, yeah.  And we're very happy to have him in the studio. 
[00:50:30]  Especially on a Monday.  Morning.  Mondays.  It's overrated to talk about Mondays, but they just suck.  Do they?  I find Mondays to kind of blend in with Thursdays.  I don't have a job.  That's true, I guess.  Wait till fucking one, and then I have to make up shit to do.  Fucking good, though.  No.  That's it.  I'm telling you.  And I work hard to be lazy motherfuckers.  Fucking Patrice nailed it.  When we were off the air for two years, you get up and make up shit to do. 
[00:51:00]  Make it up.  It's either that or go crazy.  My sleep pattern got all fucked up.  But people think it would be cool not to work.  It's cool for the first...  How long was it cool?  Year and a half.  Year eight months.  I don't even know if you can make a year.  No.  I don't even know if you can make a year.  After about three months.  You're rolling your eyes, but I'm telling you.  We weren't allowed to do anything for two years, three months.  That's just ego.  Now you want to take two years off as long as you can have the option of work.  It's all rental. 
[00:51:30]  I don't know, man.  The first two years off.  You know what I'd like to be a slave.  That's all.  White people don't function well when somebody owns you.  The first three or four months, I think we're good.  Yeah.  And then that first winter hits, and you're like, holy shit, not only do I have nothing  to do, it's winter.  I wound up going, like, my sleep pattern got all fucked up slowly.  It slowly just rotated around the clock where I'd wake up later every day.  So it got to a point where it was like I was waking up at two in the morning. 
[00:52:00]  That was when my day started at 2 a.m., and I would just sit and play video games, and  that was my life.  Video games and sleeping ridiculous hours.  I still don't time getting hit.  I don't time getting hit.  Like Steve, he's like, you know, come in at whatever, 7 or 8 or whatever.  I get up at 5.30 thinking that's, I walk right in at 7, like, ooh. 
[00:52:30]  So I'm glad every once in a while, like, if I'm on this show every once in a while, it  makes me actually feel like I have a job, or I do the fucking rub my eyes, like, fuck.  Yeah, yeah, fuck.  What time is it?  I got to do something today.  I'm not doing radio, boy.  I get up and, like, my body goes, you know, come on, man.  What the fuck you doing?  I sit on the edge of the bed every fucking morning and just go, fuck.  And I'm coming to a great gig where you come in and just fuck with shit.  But getting up in the morning early stinks. 
[00:53:00]  Is that the toughest part of the job?  Toughest part.  I think so, too.  Toughest part of any job is, toughest part of comedy is going and leaving my home  and coming back to my home.  But being there, actually, waking up in a hotel and waiting to the show.  Yeah, yeah, no.  When you're not into fucking vices like you used to be where you just, hey, watch the movie.  I'm going to buy a fucking metal detector.  I've been thinking about that.  You're going to be that guy on the beach?  I've been thinking about that because I daydreamed last night about fucking. 
[00:53:30]  I got to tell you.  But I daydreamed about hitting a lottery exactly for $270 million after, like, and I daydreamed  about, I just daydreamed about a good two hours where I couldn't sleep.  It was just like, and it was so real.  Oh, what you would do?  And I got depressed.  Oh, what I would do?  It was just amazing.  Did you get all the, when you're daydreaming like that, do you get, like, every detail's  got to be right?  Every.  Everything has to be viable.  How much I pay automatically? 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  A good 50 mil, bam, off the bat.  What I do is I fucking buy a nice car, a really fucking, really nice car.  Drive, go get my mom's out of Boston, go to her job, tell her who you want to smack.  Who do you want to smack?  Buy, fucking purchase a gangster.  You know, one of my friends who fucking likes smacking people.  Smack the shit out of whoever she wants smacked. 
[00:54:30]  Get my other friend who's stuck in Boston.  He's just never going to leave.  Like, he's just, he'll be happy with 50 G's a year just to, you know, run to the store,  get this, that, that, boom, bam, give him a million dollars check, give him a million  dollars, but he doesn't know it's a million dollars.  Yeah.  He just, it's a million spread out.  You dole it out.  Yeah, so he doesn't lose, you know, lose his mind.  What is he doing in Boston?  And he's a good friend of yours from the?  Yeah, he's just what I would have been if I didn't do comedy.  Fucking. 
[00:55:00]  What does he do, though?  He just kind of wheels and deals?  He just, he just there.  Just there.  He's a player.  He's just there.  No, he ain't a player because I wouldn't need the help.  Well, I don't think about hoping for him, he's a square, but he's like, you know.  What does he do to make money?  He works.  Well, at water, you don't want to say.  No.  I don't want to say what he does.  Well, not specifically, like, what industry?  I don't want to say his industry.  I carry him around in a Bjork.  That's what I do.  Fuck, you talking, fuck, you muscling me for info. 
[00:55:30]  That's not a crazy question.  No, it might be a guy who fucking is a square.  He's looking at me like I'm crazy.  This is what we do on this show.  We ask questions.  He's a civilian.  All right.  He's a fucking civilian.  Does he work for the CIA?  Nope.  He just fucking works.  Does he carry boxes around?  He might as well.  He's a square.  All right.  He's a square guy.  Don't look at me like I'm crazy for asking a few questions.  No, I didn't look at you like that.  That's what we do.  I'm just saying.  It's a fucking...  All right.  Good point. 
[00:56:00]  Whenever you daydream, though, shit like that, I noticed whenever I would do it, and I did  a lot more years ago than I do now, which I think is part of age.  Well, because you got actual real money.  Yeah, maybe that's it.  You almost got...  But it hasn't always been about money, like daydreaming about money.  It could be anything.  Like what?  It could be situations of, you know, zombie invasion.  Just fun shit like that.  I see like that.  I see.  And everything has to... 
[00:56:30]  I dream about superpowers, but it all leads to money.  Well, you know what, though?  You can't...  You can't...  Money buys happiness.  Fuck what people say.  Money is fucking fantastic.  You're absolutely right.  People go, money doesn't buy you health.  I know, but it doesn't...  Poor doesn't buy you health either, motherfucker.  Like, what are you talking about?  I hate that shit.  The saying, money doesn't buy happiness.  Yeah.  Like you're saying, it's a complete bullshit.  It's a ridiculous saying that we all agree with.  And I'm at the point where I'm questioning sayings now, where it's like, you know, money 
[00:57:00]  doesn't buy you...  Really?  And the other one, life isn't fair.  Life is tremendously fair.  Life isn't...  People aren't fair.  Life gives everybody water and air.  There's a person who figured out how to fuck me for water and fuck me for air.  Fuck me for oil.  Oil is here.  And I'm reading things about how the world, the collapse of the fucking...  The collapse of the economy.  The economy is our shit. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  Like, it doesn't mean that we all go into cavemen.  It means something happens where just a lot more of you and me get fucked.  Yeah, yeah.  Which is somebody who's...  Who makes money off of it.  Yeah.  Who...  The system is created.  Like...  So it's like...  So when people go, life isn't fair...  Life is fucking fantastic.  Life's pretty fair.  It is.  It's just...  You know, you want more fucked up people to die early, though.  Like, to make you, you know, to make you go, okay, life is, you know, life deals out. 
[00:58:00]  Dealing out the justice.  But shitty people live a long fucking time, man.  Yeah.  Fucking Dick Cheney won't die.  Like, as a favor.  They put something that looked like a fucking piece of plumbing that you saw at, like, a hardware store into his chest.  You got a good valve, and he's alive now.  It's not even a valve.  They're now...  Now they got something hooked directly to his heart.  It had to go to the bottom of the ventricle up into the top of his heart.  He's Iron Man.  They're pulling off the arteries completely at this point. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, because they can't do bypass on him anymore because they used up all his veins.  So now they're just putting in plumbing.  And he can't do what he wasn't doing for the last 30 years anyway, which is move.  So he's just now sitting there like Ironside.  You know what you said where, like, just fucking chilling.  But you were just saying about, you know, bad people can live for a long fucking time.  That's what made me not believe in karma, by the way, is just so many kids just fucked over.  Yeah. 
[00:59:00]  And just rich people get to relax.  And that's why I go, karma can't be real.  You know what I was watching last night?  A special on, or a biography.  They actually did an interview.  This profiler sat down and did an interview with Joel Rifkin.  Remember Joel Rifkin?  Sure do.  He was a guy from, was it Elmont?  Long Island, right?  Yeah.  Camera guy.  I think Elmont, somewhere around there.  Long Island.  And he would kill prostitutes. 
[00:59:30]  Oh.  Killed like 20 of them.  And, uh...  You know what?  The way you were saying that sounded like he was a good guy.  Like, I didn't know who he was.  It's like, okay, who's this guy?  The fantastic gentleman this man was.  You know what?  He didn't have a third name.  That's what threw me off.  Yeah.  He's usually Joel fucking...  Joel Rifkin.  Joel Jewie Rifkin.  And, uh...  Like, they showed the older pictures of him when he was doing the murders.  And then they had him now, sitting there.  He's just, like, an old guy.  Really?  Sitting there.  Well, he's getting old.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh... 
[01:00:00]  In jail?  Yeah, in jail.  And then they're asking him, you know, what do you do?  He goes, well, I do this, I do that.  He's in jail, enjoying his life in jail.  No one fucks with him because he's old.  Well, we're talking about it.  It becomes your life.  Like, you think about jail...  These guys don't really suffer in jail.  It just becomes their life.  When you haven't been in jail, or you've been in jail for a short period of time, you don't  understand, I guess, the mindset of being in there for, let's say, 25 years.  After five, six years, you're probably going, this is my life. 
[01:00:30]  You do not...  It does not rehabilitate you.  No.  It just makes you fucking...  It just becomes what it is.  After the first second of going, all right, I'm not going to get stabbed to death or raped  to death.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But then you have people going, I'd rather see him in prison rot.  Rotting in prison.  It's like, you know what?  He's got TV.  Not many of these guys rot in prison.  He's got a job.  He's fucking talking, made friends.  He's doing things.  It's fucking prison.  You're stuck in one place.  A really nice TV, too, where you can see the tubes. 
[01:01:00]  If you're able to...  They put the glass on there so you can't hide a check.  If you're able to watch LeBron James' announcement, you're not suffering in jail.  No, you're not suffering.  If you're able to watch whatever the fuck's going on in the world on TV, how are you suffering?  And that's why I am all for the death penalty, because, you know...  But it costs more people!  And it's like, oh, the death penalty...  That's a weird thing, man.  I'm not for the death penalty, man.  I love the death penalty.  Not because I don't want to see a motherfucker who dies who might deserve it.  But it's just the fact of, so I killed somebody, now who's killing me? 
[01:01:30]  The state is killing you.  And the state is a bunch of people.  I just don't want people doing shit to me.  Big fan of the death penalty.  We've agreed that...  You're a big fan of it?  Huge fan.  Oh, yeah.  You fucking read some stories about first-degree murder and child murders and shit like that,  and you know the guy did it.  It's not even a question of fucking circumstantial evidence.  It's like, why the fuck is this guy...  I think you should be an official atheist, by the way, if...  Yeah?  You can't have any god in your life if you're going to be... 
[01:02:00]  What about a...  If you execute...  You have to not believe in god to do that.  What about a power...  Some type of cosmic gelatin power thing that you believe in?  You can't have any spirituality...  No, I'm not even talking about it.  ...and fucking be a part of the death penalty.  I think you can.  You can't have a good, bad god.  You can't have a, you're good, you're going to, you know, go to a good place, you're bad,  you're going to go to a bad place, god.  But you could have something like, there was this big fucking cosmic cloud that made everything 
[01:02:30]  and made life and shit.  I do apologize.  I will say this.  Those goddamn Muslims supposedly believe in god, and their death penalties are the least...  Maybe they're closer to the bible.  Then, uh...  Maybe they're...  Wait, I'll take that back.  Like, cause I'm stoning a bitch that's buried up to her neck.  It's close to bible.  How do you protect yourself if you're buried up to your neck and people are throwing rocks at you?  That sucks, man. 
[01:03:00]  Stoning a bitch buried up to her fucking neck.  The best thing you can do is blink your eyes and hope that protects you.  You just see that rock come flying towards your face and you can't...  You do nothing but blink right when you...  You shut your eyes tight and wrinkle your nose.  And they probably wouldn't even allow you to do that.  They'd probably make sure your eyes are wide open so you can really see the rock nail you in the head.  And you couldn't even shrug your shoulders like...  You just stuck there.  You're trying to fucking...  You've never seen how important lips are until somebody's trying to stone you buried up to your fucking head. 
[01:03:30]  You try to push your cheek forward a little bit.  As your sentence.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, that, you know, I guess, look, I believe in...  You know what?  I like that shit, too.  I like that shit, too.  Why not?  Some fucking child murderer.  But it's so many, it's so many mistakes.  It's so many death penalty mistakes, man.  It's just like, don't...  They find out a lot...  Look, in Detroit, at some point, they had to just...  They had to let everybody off death row because it was so many people that were not supposed to be there after corruption and all that shit. 
[01:04:00]  They're like, we got to let everybody off because no one's supposed to be here.  So we got to just stop the...  From right now, no death penalty yet.  I think it was Detroit because it was so corrupt.  So that's what I'm saying.  It's so final.  No, a lot of people might not have deserved it.  I mean, the Gary Gilway or Gilmore or whatever, there's some guys, if they did what they did...  Yeah. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, you can...  I'm not against it on a level like, oh, poor guy.  I'm against it that it might be some innocence and who's killing you if God was like, boom, no problem.  That's why the appeals last so fucking long, though, to make sure, like, you know, you're not killing some guy that didn't do the shit.  And then you got guards doing the shit.  You got regular people...  Oh, shit.  Hold on.  Yeah.  We got a guy that actually has two family members doing life and very pissed off at us.  Rene?  Hey, what's going on? 
[01:05:00]  Freaking Nancy Grace and James Lays Mitchell over there.  Shut up, girl name.  Shut up, girl name, Rene.  You fucking girl name.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait, let me find out for a second.  Hold on, Rene.  So, Rene, are we all wrong or just these two?  Well, obviously.  No, actually, I think you're usually right.  But these two idiots...  Listen, I guess you...  These two pussies...  All right, Susan, what? 
[01:05:30]  What?  Wait, you have two family members that are doing life.  Rene?  Yeah.  Rene?  You lost Rene?  I don't know.  Where'd he go?  Rene?  Hey, you fucking fag.  Rene.  He's gone.  That's it.  Call back, Rene.  Rene's probably a criminal because he has two fucking family members in jail.  What's your brother's name?  Charlotte?  You fruit?  Girly name?  He has two family members doing life.  Yeah, he's...  And he's mad at us. 
[01:06:00]  Holy shit.  Yeah, he's...  This guy's a gangster.  It's in his blood.  Oh, fuck.  Rene, call back.  Leave Rene alone.  Because, you know, that's why a lot of people are dead.  Because they tease him about the...  And he wouldn't change his name either.  He doesn't even have a nickname like Brutasaurus.  It's like fucking...  He actually called in as Rene.  Rene.  Call back.  I want to make nice with Rene.  Fucking crazy Rene.  Don't take that call.  This one?  Okay, I know why.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:06:30]  Really?  Yeah, I don't want that wrecked.  Yeah, that's true.  You know, you're right.  And that's...  You know what's going to happen.  You're absolutely right.  We're worried before Rene scared the shit out of us.  Just a definite...  I mean, it's just...  Look, I'm not against...  I'm not against that shit on a...  Oh, all right.  How about this one?  Punishment level.  Anthony in New York.  He knows a little something about Charles Manson.  How do you know something about Charles Manson?  All right.  Well, first off...  Hey, what's up, guys?  First off, I got a good friend who was in the military who did a tour in Iraq in 2003. 
[01:07:00]  So when he got back, he told me, well, as everybody knows, Charles Manson, you know, he's still alive.  He avoided the death penalty.  And, you know, I forget it.  And, like, the 70s or something, because there was a certain clause.  It was a rule in California.  Yeah, we know.  They repealed the death penalty.  Yeah, simple as that.  Okay, continue.  They were going to kill him, and then, yeah.  Yeah.  He got lucky.  Here's the deal. 
[01:07:30]  No, y'all would think this is crazy.  This is true, though.  Right before we went to Iraq in 2003, they came to him.  And the CIA has started, like, an operation, and they wanted to use him in Iraq.  He had the opportunity to be free.  And they came to him and said, you know, here's what we want you to do.  We want you to go to Iraq and act as one of them and, you know, I guess have him dress up in the clothes or whatever and act as, like, an ambassador and try and get out Hussein. 
[01:08:00]  And they wanted to use him to talk to the people because, you know, he's a very smart man.  He's got a crazy high IQ, and he speaks a lot of languages.  They wanted to use him over there.  Opie, did you get that baby carry thing as a gift, or did you have to buy it?  Did you get it as a gift or have to buy it?  Who is Saddam Hussein?  A guy that has a gift.  With his swastika cutting his head.  Ron Bush is back.  They all wanted to use him over there. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, because he's stable, and he would do exactly what the government wants of him.  Got to turn off that awful music and play Hilda Skelter.  Do we just hang up on him?  What do we do?  Are you out of your fucking mind?  Wait a minute, but, Lizzie, you know I'm a conspiracy theorist.  It's very interesting that he's saying this.  I mean, it's possible, but there's a lot of, I mean, what is it?  He goes over there, and they tell him to pretend he's an Arab with that fucking voice he got? 
[01:09:00]  They wanted to pretend he was an Arab, and they wanted to speak to all the Arab people in his language and get them to move or travel.  I'm going to be honest, man.  Guys with this accent, never, I never seem to think they're crazy.  He had a covert plan.  I promise.  I swear to God.  I don't know if it's on documents, because the whole thing was scrapped, but I got a good friend in the military.  He's not a conspiracy theorist, but he told me that he was like, yeah.  That would come out, this is the reason, this is the reason I don't believe in, I don't believe in UFOs. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  I don't believe in anything, like, I believe in government shit to a degree, to a large degree.  But a lot of this shit you can't hide.  Like, you hear he's saying a friend of mine said this.  Yeah, said.  Charles Manson, the Charles Manson plan.  Now, that's a low-level conspiracy thing, is Charles Manson.  So at this point, this is why, you know, I'm having trouble with JFK and a lot of that stuff, 
[01:10:00]  because if somebody is going to say something, no one can keep Aliens secret, no one can even keep Operation fucking Charlie Manson secret.  By the way.  Operation Charlie Manson, I like that.  Operation Charlie Manson has to be the dumbest fucking thing I've ever heard.  Oh, no, no, no, Anthony, hold on a second.  You're there?  Yeah, yeah.  All right, hold on.  David in Oklahoma wants in on this one.  David.  Yeah, I think that guy's been listening to Alex Jones a little too much.  I mean, that's the dumbest fucking thing I've ever heard. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  It's the dumbest thing, but guess what?  But guess what?  It's the type of stuff that people like you say is the dumbest thing I've ever heard,  which is why they do shit and get away with it, because regular people like you think,  nah, it won't happen.  It won't happen.  That's for everything.  All right.  Well, who's your buddy in the Army?  Is he some low-level private that thinks he knows everything?  He's got the inside scoop on nothing?  No, no.  He's dropping people like you every day.  Nah.  Is your buddy the chef at some barracks in the middle of the desert?  Is that where you're getting this info from? 
[01:11:00]  I mean, that'll do.  Go get some stuff.  What is the most ludicrous fucking thing, dude?  Shut the fuck up.  You know what, though?  Is there any place you can send anybody that has this anywhere?  That's the thing.  When you say my buddy told me, that's where it gets fucked up.  But you've got to have a place to...  Like Alex Jones, man, he'll...  They'll always have a place to send you.  You know, the guys...  The guys that...  By the way, the guys that have...  Ah!  The guys that... 
[01:11:30]  You've got two guys arguing on the phone.  I'll fade them down a minute.  The guys that have that info aren't going to tell their buddies.  No.  That's how the CIA works.  They don't have fucking guys just going,  Oh, my God, I've got to tell my buddies back home.  Hey, who is your buddy?  Yeah, who's your buddy, Anthony?  And trust me, man.  Who's your buddy?  All those posts and those tapes and those...  Would you listen to me for a second?  Who's your buddy?  What does he do?  What's your buddy's...  Hey, hey, hey, dude, dude.  Hey, hey, Anthony. 
[01:12:00]  What does your buddy do?  Like, what line of the military is he in that he even was privy to this information?  He schemes on people's...  He pulls up IP addresses on regular people like you and me.  He listens to our conversations.  If he gets a flag, like, if you're texting a buddy...  I had a fucking buddy that told me that, man.  This is...  Hey, listen, people listen to you.  So they listen to me, what, during my phone calls and shit?  I mean, no.  It's just... 
[01:12:30]  I brought you some Big Brother.  You heard of that, right?  They do listen to you.  No, I read about it.  Call some buzzwords like,  Fuck the president and I'm going to blow up this and that shit.  I read about Big Brother in 1984.  That's like 1984 all over again.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, David, thank you.  Let me go to...  Shit, hold on a minute.  Sorry about that.  Let me go to Cassius in Brooklyn.  Cassius, you're on with Anthony in New York.  Oh, thank God.  Yeah, he's so brilliant.  It's just such the most ridiculous story.  Manson is not multilingual. 
[01:13:00]  He doesn't know anything other than English.  That's what I'm saying.  How do you know?  How do you know?  And he's world-like...  How do you know?  People know what he looks like.  Prove it.  Yeah, he's got a swastika carved into his forehead.  He sends a guy like that to do diplomatic work.  This is so asinine.  So fucking...  He's very asinine, which is why they do something like that.  Expect people like you not to believe it.  Come on.  Could you imagine if that ever got out?  Like that the president was using Charles Manson... 
[01:13:30]  Was behind Charles Manson.  A bunch of Arabs around a campfire.  He's fucking...  Yeah.  He said, no way I'm not doing that.  He'll have some Arabs going to kill us.  If it gets out, how are we going to look?  Of course he said no.  But the CIA was working on this about a couple of months before operation...  Or whatever, in 2003.  Yep.  Right before we went to Iraq.  You know what, Cassius?  He makes a good point.  What do you got on that?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's such a solid point, yeah.  You could say this about anyone. 
[01:14:00]  You could say they were trying to let anybody out of prison to do something like this.  And then you just say, you know, it's because common people like us wouldn't believe it.  That's why they would do it.  Yeah, so anything ridiculous is viable because we wouldn't believe it?  Is that it?  Wait, Anthony's got a question.  Go, Anthony.  By Cassius, you remember the Iceman, right?  The Iceman?  The Iceman from New Jersey, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  He killed over a hundred people.  He killed them in all these sick ways. 
[01:14:30]  He ice-picked them, stabbed them, he shot them.  All right, whatever.  Go forward.  Yeah, yeah, you don't remember, man.  Do your mafia history.  All right, man.  Why do you think he's still alive?  Let me ask you that.  Well, good question.  He's got you there, Cassius.  Yeah.  What, is this the person who's locked up currently?  Yeah.  I mean, he's locked up.  He does a fucking interview on Dateline every year.  It's like an anniversary thing.  And the media gets a fucking kick off this guy, man.  They get a hard-on off this dude because he's such a fucking genius. 
[01:15:00]  They won't kill him.  There's all sorts of criminals we have locked up.  That aren't being killed?  What does that prove?  That proves nothing.  It proves a lot, man.  You got to wake up.  All right, right on.  Cassius, thank you.  Wow.  You know, thank you to Cassius Jones, but I'm telling you.  All right, hold on.  Hold on, Anthony.  All right.  I'm trying to tell y'all, but y'all don't want to believe.  Anthony, shut the fuck up for a second.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Wait, he might say something good here.  I'm telling you about the whole 9-11 thing. 
[01:15:30]  Y'all look crazy not to give that any kind of weight.  Come on.  All right, listen.  You don't think we respond?  A lot of people do, though.  Hold on.  Anthony, I'm trying to shut you up because I got a guy backing you up.  We got Dana in Boston.  You're on with Anthony in New York.  Boys, good morning.  Can you hear me?  Yes, I got you, Dana.  What up, Dave?  I want to let you guys know that my brother's in the Air Force.  Yep.  And he heard that they're going to hire Jeffrey Dahmer to go to Area 51 and talk to the aliens.  Fucking John Travolta sound a retard. 
[01:16:00]  Anthony, comment.  He called you a John Travolta sounding retard.  Hey, what was his name?  Dana.  Dana.  Hey, Dana.  Hey, fuck you and the Boston Red Sox and your fucking bitch-ass name.  Bitch-ass nigga.  Oh, damn.  His name is Dana.  He's going to be calling from Boston.  I'm sorry about that, Patrice, man.  You're cool, though, but, you know, fuck Dana.  Well, you didn't have to use the N-word.  Well, Patrice isn't a bitch-ass.  Yeah, really.  He used it in the correct context.  There's a motion behind it. 
[01:16:30]  You don't want to worry about it.  What are you going to do?  Anthony, Derek in Alabama.  Derek, you're on with Anthony in New York.  Hey, yeah.  Why would they send him over to Iraq to listen to our phone calls?  Can't they just do that from here?  No, they're doing that from here, bud.  Yeah, that's the...  He has a point, though.  You can't just dismiss him.  It's possible.  You can completely dismiss this guy.  Get the hell out of here, Patrice.  Maybe Operation Charles Manson could be with someone else, though.  Yeah.  Because people say this a lot. 
[01:17:00]  They say this a lot.  Why are you wasting regular lives and filling up these jails?  There's two million people in jail, some shit.  And it's like, why not send a couple of them over?  And they might be looking into that and giving these guys choice.  They do it.  They do it on these shows where they give you...  It's called the Dirty Duck.  But they give these kids a choice.  Unless you go to jail for the rest of your life, or you go to this boot camp.  I'm sure there's some prisoners, right?  They go, okay, we're going to transfer...  You've seen Con Air. 
[01:17:30]  You go, I'm going to transfer these sick motherfuckers to this prison we just built.  Yeah.  All right?  Don't have a family.  The guy's been in jail 10 years.  Fucking no visitors.  They go, listen, you could do this for us.  Go into this training, this clockwork orange kind of shit.  And we're going to send you over to Iraq and do some clandestine work.  It's...  You can't dismiss...  You can't just say, fuck that, because he's right.  The point is, you can't just go...  You agree with the Charles Manson thing?  I agree with the possibility of things that happen that we don't believe that they can exist. 
[01:18:00]  A scandal.  It's funny that he says Charles Manson.  Charles Manson's just a funny guy to say.  But if he said this...  He's 70 years old.  He's swastika.  He sits there and makes scorpions out of people's hands.  Operation Charles Manson could exist somehow.  Listen, we got Bonnie in D.C.  I got two really good calls here.  First one is Bonnie.  Bonnie in D.C., go ahead.  Hey, how come when the other guy, Cassius, called in and said, 
[01:18:30]  Charles Manson doesn't even speak a lot of English, he's made a legitimate point,  and this other dude, Anthony, his answer was, prove it.  And that was it.  Well, you proved something.  You see what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It is, Anthony.  You don't have any, you're not, you know, it's hard to say.  I mean, I've heard some things that make sense.  A friend of mine told me why they have you bend down when planes crash  and put your head between your knees.  Yeah, yeah.  And so your neck cracks so you won't suffer.  You know, it makes sense.  But he's like, hey, I got some information.  I'm like, well, where did you get that from? 
[01:19:00]  Because your friend told you it's gospel.  Right.  It's hard to...  The only reason why I'd have the balls to call up and even like,  and comment on all that and say that is because, well,  it's my buddy who works in the military.  He does the whole, you know, the whole eavesdropping thing.  Like, the whole, like, I'll put it like this.  So he heard...  Oh, man, the military picked the wrong guy to eavesdrop.  The guy that's going to tell everybody that he's the eavesdropper.  Girl, you hear what happened?  Right.  Yeah. 
[01:19:30]  No, I'm just going to make a quick point, and then I'll punch out, though.  Hold on.  You can't...  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Before you make your quick point, C Wedge in Massachusetts,  and then we'll end with you making your point.  Go ahead, C Wedge.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah, I mentioned this whole Charles Manson thing actually was going to happen,  and it went down like it did on Team America where they, you know,  stuck shit on his face.  And, you know, Durk and Muhammad Jihad happened just like that.  Yeah, a lot of people commenting that this sounds a lot like Team America.  Team America.  Yeah.  Team America. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, very good, C Wedge.  All right.  Your point, Anthony.  I'll put it like this.  But this guy, and the only reason why I would think it's credible is because  what this guy does, he does intel.  Like, I can't say everything what, you know, he does.  Oh, sure.  This is so dangerous, though, to do what you're doing, though, Anthony.  I think you should stop.  Because at some point somebody's going to look for you and say,  who's your friend?  Oh, they're already looking for me.  I'm ready.  I'm ready.  I got a whole battle of guns. 
[01:20:30]  I'll be ready to go in the mountains if the shit pops off.  Oh, I'll pay Tabernod, because I know they're looking for me.  They ain't going to get me, though.  And you're not, and you, all of this, and you pay $14.95 a month for serious rate.  Like, you're fucking, you have enough collected that you just listen to morning radio every morning just to chill out.  Guns, ready to die, and fucking Sirius XM, motherfucker.  That's your new, that's the new commercial.  I'm ready to die and Sirius XM.  While the government's burning down your house, you'll have classic rewind, at least, to listen to. 
[01:21:00]  I'm saying, Charles Manson is what fucked him up, but if you had to say there's, I can see, it's possible to me.  Yeah, everybody believes this shit.  They do us every day what we don't think is.  All these high-tech phones, the iPhones 4 and all this stuff, if you punch in the right word, if you punch in the right word, it doesn't matter if you're on your internet.  It doesn't matter if you're on your cell phone.  If you punch in a key word, a flag comes up, and what they do is, it doesn't matter what base or where they're at, but your IP address comes up, and they pull your IP address on your phone or your internet. 
[01:21:30]  You don't sound crazy to me.  Anthony, I got my iPhone up right now.  Okay, right?  But the people that want to do harm to us, hold on, the people that want to do harm to us would speak in code.  They wouldn't just fucking make it that blatant.  Yeah, they would, they would.  I don't fucking know they wouldn't.  Yes, they would.  Okay, if you text a friend, I can't stand Obama. 
[01:22:00]  Okay, that's one thing.  If you text a friend, I can't stand Obama.  I hope he gets blown up in his meeting at Massachusetts as soon as he lands at the airport.  But that's, they wouldn't do that.  Dude, dude, you just.  I believe it.  I just.  Dude, hold on.  I know what he's going to say.  Listen to this.  You just said it.  You just said it.  You're flagged, right?  You just flagged yourself.  That's why I'm pushing on him.  I'm going to go fucking hide from there.  All right.  You just said it. 
[01:22:30]  They got your IP right now.  They got your shit.  Yeah, yeah.  They got me.  He just ruined his whole reason by saying that.  Yeah, but he's not worried about it.  He's ready to kill everybody.  That's true.  As he listens to fucking Asia.  Jesus Christ, man.  That guy is batshit crazy.  Batshit crazy with this fucking.  I don't think so.  Come on.  Yeah, but a batshit crazy guy explained to me why bread is bad.  Like a homeless guy's just screaming why bread is bad.  And I go, this is.  This makes a lot of sense. 
[01:23:00]  Or a crazy man.  I've heard.  The only person I've ever heard to make space travel make sense.  Like the how do you space travel quickly?  You know, with the science of it.  It was crazy, people.  It's not like.  Like Dr. Kaku, when he called.  He's a nut.  Like he's not a regular dude, man.  He's insane.  But he's not saying his friend.  Like his whole story.  Do you think a guy.  Charles Manson's kind of.  He has a swastik in the middle of his forehead. 
[01:23:30]  I know, but Operation Charles Manson's could be.  I'm just saying.  Without him.  Hold on.  Some young fucking.  Let Anthony wrap this thing up.  Do you think this fucking guy has a friend in intelligence that knows.  Now he knows him well enough because he's his friend.  He's like, hey, my buddy, Anthony, you know, the loud mouth motherfucker, Anthony, that babbles all kinds of shit.  I'm in military intelligence to the point where I know all kinds of shit that they're doing.  Let me tell my dopey friend, Anthony, that fucking blabs it out to everyone. 
[01:24:00]  I absolutely agree with you.  Okay.  And here's here's the thing I'll add.  I think a friend told me when you're dealing with a guy like this.  Yeah.  Is that his friend is him.  And I think he might be if he's if he's fucking has the Tyler Durden shit.  Yeah.  If he has the ideas.  I mean, if he's saying that he has guns and he's waiting for this shit, he's you know, he might be listening to certain things.  And then you elaborate because I, you know, you when you're crazy, you do crazy things. 
[01:24:30]  Sometimes I catch myself daydreaming like we was talking about.  Yeah.  About things.  And it becomes very real a daydream.  And you make it make sense and you make it fucking in your head.  Yeah.  You got to make it work.  I think he doesn't have a friend.  And, you know, and I think that, you know, he made it up.  Guys, that entire time, Rene called back from New Mexico.  Oh, Rene.  And hopefully having him on hold for 20 minutes calmed him down a little bit.  Yeah, what happened, Rene?  Rene.  Hey, what's going on?  Now, let's talk about this man to man. 
[01:25:00]  Okay, listen.  You have.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Because people are just tuning in.  You have two family members that are doing life in prison.  And you got.  Hold on.  I'm just setting up.  Hold on.  I'm setting up the whole thing for you, Rene.  And then you can talk as long as you want.  And we have said many times in the show, and it's not just us saying it.  We've actually talked to guys that have been in the joint for a very long time.  We have a nice fan base with guys that are in jail.  Incarcerated fans, yes.  Or have done many, many years.  And they agree with us.  They said, after a while, jail just becomes your life. 
[01:25:30]  And you're not really suffering as much as the average person would think.  Well, most of your callers agree with everything you guys say.  So that really doesn't mean anything.  All right.  All right.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  I've got a cousin doing 25 to life.  He deserves it.  And I've got a nephew doing 40 to life.  He deserves it.  And I've got another nephew who's getting out in a couple weeks.  And he just took some kind of ice pick to the ear.  Some fucking family you got there.  Yeah, they're nuts.  But anyway, that's another point. 
[01:26:00]  And they call me.  I go see them and write to them here and there.  I don't go see them all the time because they're in California now.  But they're miserable, man.  They're like sad, run down, depressing people.  I'm not saying it's a great place.  I'm just saying it becomes your life.  No one's rotting away in prison.  Like the family of the victim likes to think someone's rotting away in prison.  They're living their life. 
[01:26:30]  They adapt to the situation and live.  You don't have to fight every day almost to freaking get to your day and watch.  You don't got to fight every day.  You know what?  It's mundane.  It's fucking routine.  It's like everyone that gets up for their stupid job every morning and then comes home  to a naggy wife or whatever the fuck it is.  It's just another mundane, routine life that these guys live.  Yeah, we're not saying that it's the most exciting thing in the world.  They're eating, they're fucking, yeah. 
[01:27:00]  Just like in society, there are bad motherfuckers that can fuck you up.  So you don't want them to eat, Anthony?  Is that your deal?  No, I didn't say that at all.  I just said violent criminals that perpetrate horrid crimes against humanity do not deserve  to live in a place that is adaptable, that they can then adapt to.  They need horrid places.  They need places where they have to work too much, where they suffer every day and have 
[01:27:30]  to really think about what they did every day.  I will say, though, thinking back to what we were saying, I think we were approaching  it with, we were approaching it with free man's tongues.  Like, I think what you're doing right now is, it makes sense to explain it.  It wasn't, the context wasn't, man, fuck, prison is just simple prison.  Oh, we're not saying that at all.  It's just as, after five or six years, the point being, it stops being, you don't live 
[01:28:00]  like, the suffering of a man in prison after five years.  After five years, you're not the guy on day one when that fucking cell door slams shut.  And it's not saying that it's happiness.  No, no.  It's just an adaption.  You adapt.  You're not horrified like you were on day one.  We've adapted to our environment here at Sirius XM, haven't we?  What's up, sir?  Last week, you come on the radio and you go, yeah, I had a cop party. 
[01:28:30]  Well, I had nothing but cops there.  You know how faggy you sound when you said that?  Well, I had a cop party.  Why?  Because I had a bunch of cops over my house?  No, because, like, you think that impresses us?  Like, hey, I had a cop party.  No, it was a party with cops there.  Dumb fucking cunt.  Renee girl name.  Hey, hey, twat.  Hey, you fucking bullshit twat cunt.  I was talking about a party, a party that people were at that were cops. 
[01:29:00]  I wasn't saying it to impress the likes of fucking Renee and his fucked up dysfunctional prison family.  Go fuck yourself.  I hope they all get shanked.  I hope they all get shanked.  I hope they get shanked and fucked up the ass by big black guys.  Go fuck your mother.  Fuck your whore mother.  Fuck your whore mother.  Or is she in prison, too?  Renee, you pussy cunt.  You pussy fuck.  Fuck you, Renee.  Fuck you, faggot. 
[01:29:30]  Fuck you, fag.  Good, good.  Good, with your shitty family.  Your shitty prison burden family.  You're burdened.  Your family's a burden.  Girl name.  Girl name.  Girl name.  What's your cousin Kathy in for?  What's he in for?  He's gone.  You fag.  Why'd you have to say black cock in front of Patrice?  Did you really have to go there?  No one likes black cock in their ass.  We're not the only one raping in prison. 
[01:30:00]  Is it possible?  Yeah, really.  Jesus Christ.  You could have went to Latino there.  You could have kept it PC friendly for Patrice.  You could have even went to fucking Aryan Brotherhood.  You watch these shows.  When it comes to prison rape, blacks are the scariest.  Everyone's afraid of the black prison rape.  Black and rape is the going trend.  No, it's just the big cock.  Because you guys got the biggest cock.  The image of the big cock.  So it would, yeah.  So it would hurt more. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, no Eddie cock going in your ass in prison.  Let me tell you something.  The pinky rape gang is scary, nigga.  Like, anything that's trying to go in your ass against your will.  The urologist gang is just not fun either.  You're right.  Playing hard to get.  I like that.  But Anthony goes black cock and Patrice just fucking throws his hands up.  Of course you had to go there.  You just got to go black cock.  The sisters, thank you.  What about the sisters?  The sisters are badass. 
[01:31:00]  What about the fucking sisters, man?  You need a friend?  I just want to say Rene made some great points in his phone call.  I could be your friend.  Opie is your friend.  Rene's a faggot.  Fuck that asshole and his dysfunctional burden prison family.  With his fucking, this one's in for 25.  He deserves it.  And this one's in for 40 to life.  He deserved it.  Shut up.  Tell us what they did then.  You fucking savage family.  How many listeners of this show do you think don't like the show?  Oh, a lot. 
[01:31:30]  But listen.  How many people work here don't like the show?  He doesn't like you.  He went to some other shit.  There's a weird group of.  You bug him.  Patrice, I'll answer your question.  There's a weird group of fans, I'll put it in quotes, that just want to hate.  They listen to hate.  That guy's in a whole other category, though.  I wish I knew what he was saying, but I couldn't let him get a word in.  I had to talk about horrible shit.  Could someone go listen to the phone call?  Because I think he probably said some horrible things.  What was he trying to say to me? 
[01:32:00]  Some about, I know you live.  Oh, was it?  I've been there already.  I was at your party.  I was at your party.  I know the cop's name.  Can we summarize?  I mean, obviously, not everyone doing a hard time in prison is, yeah, they're miserable.  They're fucking, it's a nightmare.  Just get the context.  It's been our experience with this dumb show talking to, you know, guys that have been in and out of jail.  It's like the majority of people, it becomes your life.  You're not completely suffering. 
[01:32:30]  You'd rather be out on the outside, I'm sure, but it becomes your thing.  And because this dumb family got caught and sent to prison, that I'm friends with cops and have them at my house for a party is a problem with Renee?  What the fuck was that about?  But some people who aren't squares, too, like, jail comes with the territory, and it's like, you know, they're not afraid.  That's why you go back in and out.  It's like, once you're a person on the street, you get caught. 
[01:33:00]  What are you going to be when you come out?  You're not, what are you going to make, $10,000 a year?  What are you going to make, $30,000 a year?  A regular guy who's a plumber, I guess plumbers make $60,000, maybe, you know what I mean?  It's like, he's used to that.  He knows how to live like that, and he's going to live like that for his whole life.  But a guy who does crime, and then you go to jail, you're not a, jail is not a deterrent after you're there.  Wait, wait.  Steal somewhere else.  Can I tag?  No, but I'm saying, Patrice, let me jump in here, because you make a great point.  And then on top of that, you get out of jail, and now it's on your record. 
[01:33:30]  So now you can't even get a legitimate job.  You can't get a regular job.  I'm thinking if you come out of jail, and you got a record now, you should go to the top of the fucking list to be hired.  Ew.  Wow.  Think about it, though.  Because they make it even harder.  That's a fucking great point, because that's the fact being, they send you to jail to rehabilitate.  They say you are now okay to go back in society.  But you have the thing on your record.  With nothing, but the only option is, I'm going to either work at McDonald's, where you can lie about working there. 
[01:34:00]  Like, you can lie about your reference and lie about having a record.  Right.  Or, to survive, you got to do some fucked up shit and go back.  Any legitimate job, an employer is not going to hire you if you have that on your fucking record.  So I'm thinking if you have that on your record, then that's the people you should be hiring.  I think that's a fucking great point, man.  It'll keep the streets a little safer.  That's better than, I think that's higher than affirmative action.  Really, I'm telling you.  Because a black person without a record, okay, has a better chance than anybody coming out of jail. 
[01:34:30]  And you're trying to do the right thing.  And you're like, look, first you got a parole officer.  When you're a ward of the state, I watch some of these things where you go on parole.  If they gave me 10 years in prison, okay, I serve three.  And I do seven years parole.  I'd rather do the whole 10.  And I know that sounds fucking crazy.  The whole 10 and not be a ward of the state.  Wow.  Because it's like having a master. 
[01:35:00]  The jail is already in your life.  Now they constantly are on you about going back.  And you got to report to this guy who can say, you know what?  I'm going to fuck you on your piss test.  I'm going to fuck you because you were late reporting to me.  I'm going to put you back in jail for another year.  Then you get out and you still got the whole six over your head.  You can't leave the state.  You can't do anything.  You can't get a job.  When you get out of jail and if they say that you are fucking good enough to leave jail, they should make people fucking hire you. 
[01:35:30]  Or only have the ability to have the law enforcement check your record.  Everybody else, you're a fucking free guy.  You're a civilian.  Because why wouldn't you go back to doing street shit after you get out of jail?  There's no choice.  You don't have a choice.  You want a murderer?  Well, I mean.  Like working with your fucking.  Obviously my theory has some fucking holes in it.  But I'm just saying it's not the craziest thing.  But the state.  It's like, look.  I'm not saying. 
[01:36:00]  Don't let him out.  You're saying he's a part of society now.  Right.  Don't let him out.  Yeah, but you're part of society with consequences based on your fucking.  Consequences.  But that's going to come back to bite you.  You went to jail was the fucking reason you went.  Like you went.  The jail is supposed to be there for your rehabilitation.  It's the purpose of going.  You commit murder.  I put you in.  This is why I always said one thing.  I don't agree with Michael Vick. 
[01:36:30]  I'm a dog lover.  But the thing about Michael Vick going to jail and all these apologies that he had to do.  Yeah, yeah.  Jail is here.  So you don't ever have to say I'm sorry.  But there's shit that happens after you get out because you were in.  What do you mean?  What if I joined the KKK and then I'm not in the KKK anymore?  Should people just be like, well, he's out now.  No, no, no.  The KKK isn't.  But it's a repercussion based on what I did. 
[01:37:00]  This is all quote unquote.  Okay.  The state is saying to the society, we're taking him out of society.  This guy gets life with no parole.  We think what he did was so fucked up.  He can't.  He's never leaving.  He's not good enough to come back with us.  Yeah.  The other guy is 10 years, 10 to 25, or 25 to life, maybe 15 to life.  15 years.  If we think of 15 years, if he's doing okay here, we're going to give him a chance in society. 
[01:37:30]  Okay.  He has another.  He now 10 to life, meaning, I mean, 25 to life.  He has the rest of his life to be awarded a state.  Okay.  He has to be on a straight and narrow.  He goes into a fucking job.  Okay.  And he's, and he has a skill.  Like, look, I think you, if he has a wall street skill or if he has a fucking executive  position skill, get his motherfucking executive position job, even though he fucking committed  the murder only because the state. 
[01:38:00]  Now your clan point don't make sense because you chose the clan.  Then you chose leaving.  The clan's not the state.  But you chose the crime.  Yeah, but people make mistakes and you never made a fucking mistake.  I made a mistake by joining the clan.  What happened?  What big mistake you made in your life, man?  Anything?  Ugh.  Got married.  Yeah, there's the one.  But I mean, okay, you got married.  All right.  Now, you got married and the Jill situation that's documented. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  Right?  The next, the next bitch coming around, every bitch from there on judges what you are by  the fact that you had two failed relationships.  Well, that's.  Now they judge you immediately based on that.  That's true.  I mean, it's, it's like, it's unfair.  Why is it unfair though?  Tell you the truth.  I'll even be honest with you.  You lost your point.  Why is it unfair?  It's unfair because you want to change, but if you could never.  I did it.  If you could never get. 
[01:39:00]  Don't mean.  That's not the point.  Doesn't mean I'll never do it again.  That's not the point.  The point is those, the new girls, you never.  And this is hypothetical to the hypotheticalness.  You, you can't get another girl based on what you did with those other two relationships.  Well, like the convict, you would have to rebuild your trust.  And, and, and if you got to go out and work a shitty job and then, uh, uh, shitty job  is fine.  By the way, any shitty job is fine. 
[01:39:30]  It's hard to get a shitty job.  And if you're a felon, you can't get a shitty, where do you, where do you go?  Yeah.  You can rebuild your trust.  Good point.  But that's what I'm saying.  Um, but right now you don't, you can get, you can get pussy tomorrow.  You can fix cars over there at Lundegaard's fucking, uh, you can, but go over to Lundegaard's  and go, Hey, fucking Shep Proudfoot.  We can continue this after the break.  That's fucking, nope.  You fucking, don't know him, won't vouch for us.  That's a great, and the fucking Fargo, why do I, why do I know Fargo analogies? 
[01:40:00]  I love that fucking moment.  All right, listen, Patrice O'Neal's going to be at the Miami Improv this weekend, Friday,  Saturday, and Sunday, miamiimprov.com for tickets, or follow, uh, Patrice on Twitter,  Big Mama Prods, he'll tweet about his Miami shows, I'm sure.  We'll go to break with this, and then, uh.  You know, it's a Radisson, so it's pretty good.  Yeah, and then we'll do something else.  You should say the other guy.  You should say the other guy.  Oh, we square!  We square.  You're darn tootin'.  That's a great movie. 
[01:40:30]  Ah, what the Christ.  Ah, what the Christ.  It's a comedy.  You're such a super lady.  Coen Brothers, by the way, best movie makers, I think.  Yeah, fucking great, man.  I love Coen's brothers' movies.  Yeah, after.  It's just the tags.  Miller's Crossing.  It's just the tags.  All right, listen, we'll play this, and then E-Rock's going to play a little something  for Anthony in New York, and then we'll do something else,  and then we'll come back and we'll talk to Patrice some more.  Hello?  Fucking embarrassment to me.  Hello?  You look like a fucking bitch on heat.  Who do you want to talk to?  And if you get raped by a pack of niggers, it'll be your fault. 
[01:41:00]  Why don't you go out and fuck your mother, you son of a bitch?  You'd be a nice guy, ain't you?  Hello?  Stay on this phone and don't hang out for me.  I can.  I have plenty of energy to drive over there.  Huh?  What comedy do you want?  You should just fucking smile and blow me!  Yeah, come over here.  I'll suck your prick.  I deserve to be blown first!  Sure, I'll cut your fucking prick off.  Blow me first!  Well, you motherfucker cocksucker.  Why don't you come over and talk to me person to person? 
[01:41:30]  You need a fucking pat on the side of the head.  But you ain't got the nerve, you fucking bum.  No, no, you're all angry now.  Come on down, you son of a bitch.  I'll give you a $50 reward.  What would you not fucking rose garden, you cunt?  Huh?  You understand that?  Because I'm capable of it.  You understand that?  Why don't you come down, you yellow son of a bitch?  For what?  You motherfucker bum.  Fucking blow me, bitch.  If anybody would say that to me, I'd come down and fight him. 
[01:42:00]  Fuck you!  We now return to the worldwide broadcast of the Opie and Anthony show.  Uh, okay.  On the virus.  On the virus.  Series XM.  Patrice rules.  Opie and Anthony.  Patrice O'Neal.  We were talking a little sports, so Anthony kind of faded away on us.  Speaking of sports.  Yeah, I... 
[01:42:30]  Why are you a sports fan, man?  No, no, basketball, I have no clue.  He hates basketball.  I have no clue about it.  I don't know.  Couldn't play it?  Oh, no, I could never play it.  Didn't have a jump shot?  Never shot around?  Oh, no.  Anthony's logic on basketball isn't that bad.  It really isn't that bad.  I've watched the last couple of minutes of a basketball game and thought it was exciting  and fun and shit.  But for the most part, it's like, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.  Score, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.  Score, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.  It's like, you know something? 
[01:43:00]  I can't get into this.  And that's my thing on every sport that I don't like, is I always ask.  I'll trash the sport and I'll just go, look, somebody please explain to me why it's good.  Just tell me the intricacies of it.  One sport I did learn is hockey.  I did learn some things.  Hockey rules.  I go, oh, okay, this is why they're stopping and doing this.  This is why they're fighting.  This is why the goalie's missing. 
[01:43:30]  It's like, oh, okay, I get it.  I get it.  Oh, this is skill.  I see what a skillet.  That's all.  I just want to know.  Just let me know.  In my world, hockey is the sport to the point where I'm still following my shitty Islanders.  They haven't done shit in over a decade and I'm still all in every year with the Islanders.  It's the hitting for me.  I love the hitting.  Okay, fair enough.  More than anything in hockey.  I think football.  Even better than, I mean, a good fight in hockey still rules, but in general, I love some big fucking hits. 
[01:44:00]  Okay, take the hitting out because hitting is almost a dessert to the game.  What is the thing where you, as a casual watcher, I watch hockey other than the hitting because I see the hitting.  What is it that they're doing that you go, I should appreciate as a non-fan?  I mean, that's a really good question because where I'm at with hockey, now I'm going to sound kind of like hypocritical. 
[01:44:30]  I'm a little frustrated by the sport because I think the guys have gotten so big and so fast that it looks just very crowded out there.  You know, it looks great that fucking moves, like when they're stick handling and they're working through two guys and the finesse around guys.  Yeah, the skills are amazing, but what frustrates me about hockey these days, they're just fighting to get the puck for most of the fucking game.  And then finally they can get a play going.  But for the most part, they're just fighting to try to get the fucking puck. 
[01:45:00]  But a real hockey fan would even know how to appreciate even what you're saying bores you.  They would know how to appreciate that.  I'm not saying it bores me, it frustrates me.  I feel like the NHL is going to have to do something eventually because they're just getting too damn good.  But is this a basic hockey thought that you're having?  Yeah, it's a dumb thought.  You mean hockey fans on a regular agree with you on what you're saying now?  I don't know about that.  They would probably go, you know, shut the fuck up. 
[01:45:30]  You don't know anything about sports like they usually do.  But, I mean, my point with hockey, I feel like if they made the rinks bigger, it would be a much more exciting game.  Give these guys a little room because, like Ant said, their skills are ridiculous, what they can do with the puck.  But football, I think, is one of the most exciting sports ever because the scoring isn't that high, for the most part, unless you get those blowout games.  And it's like every time the team has the ball, that's exciting. 
[01:46:00]  It's like, all right, they're making a drive.  Here they go.  And you get a first down.  Holy shit.  Like, there's exciting shit happening.  I think football is the number one able to explain why it's good to somebody who's not into it.  It's like, it's 22 guys, and you can point at every one of them at every play and go, watch 72.  Watch why he's good.  Watch that block. 
[01:46:30]  I've seen plays where you go, holy shit, look at that block.  It wasn't a vicious.  It just was.  Perfect.  Watch this guy move a guy with his left hand, run over, and block another guy.  Holy, now, you can go, and then you go, watch the running back, which you get, the running back and the quarterback and what they call the skill positions speak for themselves.  Yeah, that's all you're, most people, that's all they're focusing on.  Watch Lawrence Taylor. 
[01:47:00]  You go watch.  What, rape a girl?  Watch him and watch his wife defend him.  God damn it.  If you're going to get married, marry a black bitch, man.  She will fucking be in your fucking corner, man.  Is that denial on her part?  No, black bitches got your back.  They just got your back.  Oh, cheating?  Hardy har har.  Fucking sad.  Black bitch was with Jesse James, baby.  Come on, just don't make me look stupid.  Getting back to the hockey, though, the goals and the saves are, you know, pretty fucking amazing. 
[01:47:30]  The goals are self-explanatory.  I wish the scoring was a little higher in hockey.  It seems like it's a bit low for my taste.  I would like to see a few more goals and a few more fights, to be honest with you.  I love the fighting.  But still, do you see how you're just not explaining it?  That's what I'm saying.  You didn't really explain football that well.  Yes, I did.  I didn't explain hockey to you.  But I'm saying, if you sat and watched a football game with somebody that don't like football, 
[01:48:00]  you can show, if they still don't like football, you go, ah, go fuck yourself.  You're not going to go, it's not a boutique sport, man.  I actually explained how hockey can be a little better in my eyes, that's all.  I'm saying.  But I mean, the hitting, when you see someone get fucking crushed into the boards, that's exciting.  But that's self-explanatory, Opie.  No, and then a team that hits very well will do very well.  Because it opens up some room, it opens up some plays, it opens up some scoring opportunities. 
[01:48:30]  A home run, I get it.  A big time shortstop, a 2-7-12 double play, I don't know what the fuck.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  That's self-explanatory when you watch it.  How many home runs you see?  You are a sports center.  Explain how baseball is a great sport.  It stinks.  I hate it.  But I'm saying, a baseball enthusiast.  I think I did a better job defending hockey than, like.  You didn't do a bad job.  I'm saying, you explain, okay, a home run, a double play. 
[01:49:00]  You see, the highlight parts, you see.  Right, right, right.  And it's self-explanatory.  I'm saying, the nuance of it.  I was keeping out the obvious.  When you see a fucking goal, a 9 out of 10 times, it's like, wow, that was fucking cool.  Like, basketball, look, there is a skill.  Because I played.  Obviously.  There's a skill to having a ball in your hand, and you're dribbling it, and some other motherfucker's  trying to take it.  And you know how to move the ball with your hand.  It's an amazing skill to watch a motherfucker dribble. 
[01:49:30]  Or, watch a motherfucker with a 6'10 guy in your face, shoot this fucking ball into a hole  day big.  You see the, you know, it's just, you see it.  Let me jump in on that one.  Basketball, by far, was my number one sport.  I don't know, they lost me somewhere.  And I don't know.  I'll tell you where they lost you.  What?  You have to.  Well, we talked about the neck tattoos.  More of a.  Yeah, you have to embrace.  You have to embrace that you're white. 
[01:50:00]  You don't embrace that you're white enough.  More as a joke, we started saying when the tattoo started, you know, raising above the  neckline, I tapped out.  It got too niggery, man.  I don't.  Be honest.  Patrice, I would be.  I don't know if it's that.  It's too niggery.  So.  It wasn't Nick.  Magic.  So who made it that?  Who made it that?  Iverson?  I don't want to blame Iverson for niggery.  I don't.  I don't.  I don't want to blame him.  But David Stern had a dress code implemented. 
[01:50:30]  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because I'm going to tell you, Steve Nash still dresses like a homeless man.  Dirk Nowinski dresses like that dirty looking, that dirty, pressed on their face, wet,  gray hair.  Greasy guys.  Sicking me.  But it was made up for these gangsters.  And I think the product is this.  Not a lot of black people show up at the fucking game.  It's a white little kid.  White kids are there.  Which is.  And when you see this talented up nigger trying to save the ball and he knocks your little 
[01:51:00]  white boy, this white kid's popcorn out of his hand.  And he's just got his nigger sweat on your white kid.  They're trying.  Let's be honest.  Look, you know what?  Let's be fucking honest.  You know what?  This world is really fucked up because we don't even acknowledge it.  Because I get to a Knick game maybe a couple times a year and you can't see a fucking black  guy in the entire place.  In the back.  There's some black fans.  In the back.  Spike Lee's there, you know.  And you're trying to tell me if you go to Madison Square Garden to watch the Knicks,  you would just assume that white people are the only ones that love basketball. 
[01:51:30]  And the NBA doesn't even want to acknowledge that that's a problem.  that their biggest fan base aren't even going to the games because they can't.  They probably can't afford it.  They probably can't afford the tickets.  Only when your team stinks.  Oh, that's classic, though.  Then you get this fucking Knicks.  This is the problem with fucking racial conversations.  And I can feel a bunch of them.  It's look.  But I don't know.  Just admit it. 
[01:52:00]  There's no other reason it would be bad to you except for it's a little bit niggery for you.  I guess.  And foreign.  I get it.  There's no regular white boys playing basketball no more.  Yeah, but how do I relate to hockey, guys?  They're all Canadian.  Yeah, but they're regular white boys.  So just because they're white, I go, oh, okay.  Yes.  All right.  Yes.  And I'm going to tell you, there's a lot of black guys playing hockey.  If those black guys, there's like seven or eight now.  They're moving up.  That's a lot? 
[01:52:30]  It's noticeable.  Comparatively speaking, sure.  But that's not a lot.  And compared to the fact that hockey is anti-black.  It's just not meaning.  Wait, let me reiterate.  Meaning it's not a sport that black people.  Why don't black people like hockey?  You know what it is?  For the basic point, it's too expensive.  Now, I know a white guy goes, because you got weak ankles, nigger.  Now, it's cold.  Niggas don't like cold.  They got weak ankles.  It's an expensive sport. 
[01:53:00]  To play.  It's a daddy.  It's a daddy sport.  Yes, yes.  It's a daddy rinse the rink.  The fathers always get the sons into it.  It's a daddy buys two $300 skates.  I guess that's the price of, you know, the stick.  You're right.  You're right.  The fact that they have to get up at five in the morning.  But I never played hockey, really.  A little street hockey, I guess.  Yeah, street hockey.  That's why you don't play hockey.  You play basketball.  Basketball is easy.  A fucking hole.  So is that why we like the sports we like?  It's because we played them growing up, and then, you know what I mean?  That's why kids in Brazil love, you know. 
[01:53:30]  Why can't we like sports we never played, though?  We can, but you don't understand.  I'm just asking the question.  I don't know the answer.  No, no, no.  I'm saying we don't, because the reason I.  Because if you look at hockey, it's a fucking cool sport to check out.  Yes.  You grew up on it.  You can't play it unless you were raised playing hockey.  And again, like Patrice said, you know, that's a father thing.  It's a, the equipment costs a lot.  No, it's ridiculous.  You don't just get a basketball and go to the fucking park.  You can start shooting fucking hoops.  At any time you want.  Right.  Exactly.  Ice is hard to come by. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I'll tell you this much, though.  With the whole LeBron James thing, I'm back in.  I want to see the Miami Heat lose fucking 50 games this year.  Why does everybody just want to see him fucking it?  It ain't going to happen, dude.  It ain't going to happen.  Why does everyone want to see him lose?  But I'll tell you.  I'm going to tell you something.  This is why.  Somebody made a point.  I don't know where, but if you made it, you made it.  I'll have forgot.  But LeBron won 66 games without Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh.  Was it 66?  66.  No, they didn't go 66 and 16. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  I thought they won 61 and 21.  61, but the year before 66, they won 60 games.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  He's been a 60-game winner, and he went to the championship his second year without them.  They're not losing 50 games.  I know.  But when they lose the championship, that's going to be awesome.  If they go, they're not going to fucking lose.  I'm all in, though.  I'm an NBA fan again, officially.  I'm announcing it here.  I will be watching a lot more games this year.  This is a beastly team, man.  Yeah, I understand. 
[01:55:00]  Beast.  But it's going to happen to the Knicks.  Me and Patrice were talking the other day.  It's going to happen to the Knicks next year.  Now the thing in the NBA is you have to build your super team.  They're not going to get away.  Your super team.  LeBron and these guys are not going to get away with this shit.  Other teams are now figuring out how they build their super team.  Well, to not make it racial once again, I'm telling you.  The NBA will not allow.  The NBA will not allow niggas to run their.  These are all white men. 
[01:55:30]  They're not going to let niggas get together and make decisions on what the fuck they're going to be doing.  What if they're talking in code?  Trust me.  What if they're talking in code and they've got the same agent?  How does the NBA prevent that?  How do they stop that?  The teams.  David Stern, what he is, people go he's the commissioner, but what he is, he's the voice of the owners.  He's the owner's boy.  So the owners, anything that David Stern has a problem with, the owners have a problem with.  The owners are not going to allow, small market teams are not going to allow the Knicks, the Celtics, the Lakers to just buy championships. 
[01:56:00]  It ain't going to happen.  There's no salary cap in baseball as far as I'm concerned, which is why the Yankees exist.  So hold on.  They're just going to allow Miami to win fucking, you know, possibly five, six, seven.  It's too late.  They've done that.  That's what I'm saying.  But that's it.  So the NBA, in a way, should allow a few more teams to make their super team.  The NBA is going to go, you deal with it.  The have-nots, you deal with it. 
[01:56:30]  Wow.  And then you're going to have old school guys get an interview, like Jordan.  Jordan would go, if that happened when he played, if Isaiah, Bird, and Magic was on the same team, Jordan would go, fuck all three of you motherfuckers.  How about I'll beat you by myself?  That was basketball when I loved to watch it.  Now they go, let's join forces.  Gangsters, they ain't fucking, they ain't free leaders.  This ain't the Justice League of America, motherfucker.  Funny you should say that.  Michael Jordan to NBC Sports, he said this very recently, over the weekend, I believe. 
[01:57:00]  I would have never called up Larry, called up Magic, and said, hey, let's get together and play on one team.  I mean, that's, but that's, things are different.  You know, I can't say that's a bad thing.  I mean, that's the opportunity these kids have today.  I mean, you know, in all honesty, I was trying to beat those guys.  I got to tell you, I think Michael Jordan follows Patrice on Twitter.  Yeah, that's exactly what Patrice said.  This was Patrice's whole argument.  Everybody kind of was making that same argument.  It's just that you look at Jordan.  Jordan built a team around him. 
[01:57:30]  And here's what they did.  They not only, Jordan got so good that they knew, okay, if B.J. Armstrong, who was the point guard, then, if he was fucking up, let's get another B.J. Armstrong dude.  That all he does is make jump shots.  Well, Steve Kerr won a couple of championships because they know all we need, if Jordan's on the court, if Jordan's not going to take the last shot, have a guy, once they collapse, kick it over, and your job, stupid, is to hit jump shots. 
[01:58:00]  What an amazing three-point shooter, huh?  I'm telling you, dude.  I don't understand the LeBron thing.  We go around in circles.  It's different.  He was one lousy player away from winning championships for Cleveland.  He could have won.  He could have won.  He just was leaving.  And, you know, look, Jordan told you.  And he was quite friendly about it.  He's like, I would never have called the greatest players in the world and say, help.  He would have tried to beat them.  And he said, it's different now.  And the different is this.  The different is the money, right? 
[01:58:30]  Jordan never made a $100 million contract.  I don't think he ever signed a $100 million contract.  He made all his money from endorsements or whatever.  But the free agent, I'm sure, look, the thing that sports people, I think, love about this LeBron thing is the idea that the players do have a little power.  It gives you a little bit of, like, wow, man.  Yeah.  It's the OJ verdict.  It's just it gives you a little bit of pride that, yeah, a nigga beat the system. 
[01:59:00]  But now the system is going to have a nice boot on their neck.  And that's it.  Let's say hi to Jason in Jersey.  Jason, what am I doing wrong with the hockey thing with Patrice?  Okay.  I know you love your hockey, but, Jesus, you've got to do a little bit better job of getting at least a Massachusetts boy to like hockey.  It's not that hard.  I mean, Patrice, you grew up during the Big Bad Bruins, didn't you?  Back in the late 70s.  Hockey's a white fucking sport.  Boston is racist.  So it just represents crackers with sticks to me.  But I'm saying, how do I like it? 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  All Patrice wants to know is how do you sell hockey to a guy that doesn't like the sport?  All right.  Maybe I did a bad job.  But how would you do it, Jason?  Well, first, the bigger ice surface, you want to watch the European game.  It's all skill.  You're loosely hitting you a lot.  You love the fighting, which you're going to have.  You've got a nice fighter there for next year with Trevor Gillies.  He's going to be your big hit.  Let me ask you a question.  Trevor rules.  Is fighting and hitting, is that a part of hockey?  Well, they've sort of been trying to get the fighting out of the fucking sport, which is stupid. 
[02:00:00]  Let the fucking guys fight.  They barely hurt each other.  They're fighting on skates.  I mean, how much momentum do you really get in the end?  A few guys get fucking beat up pretty good.  I watched 25 greatest MSG hockey fights last night.  Yeah.  It's pretty fun.  It's awesome, right?  And Trevor, Clark Gillies' son is playing for the Islanders now, Ant, and he's an animal.  Oh, is he?  He's a fucking animal.  Is he huge?  He's big.  He fights.  He's old school.  He's like his pups.  Yeah, big guy.  I'm not saying make the rings as big as like a fucking soccer field. 
[02:00:30]  You open it up a little bit so you can see these guys skate a little bit more.  But you make the ring bigger so that they can do what?  It just feels crowded.  Okay.  Like, there's a lot of...  Do you get frustrated, Jason, when you see a lot of time being eaten up, just trying...  The team's just trying to get control of the puck?  You know what?  I've seen some of the games on the bigger ice surface.  Because if you get frustrated watching on the smaller, like the NHL fan rink, the Olympic 
[02:01:00]  rink is ridiculous.  You've got these huge corners.  You're going to see all those checkers go away.  You've got more finesse guys in the game.  I don't disagree with you, Jason.  How about somewhere in between then?  Okay.  How about you open it up just slightly?  Oh, Vetchkin and whose other kid?  Crosby?  Crosby.  Okay.  Maybe this is a better question.  Why are they good?  Why are they good?  Meaning, why are they better than everybody?  Why do I know their names?  Well, why do I know Gretzky's name? 
[02:01:30]  Oh, Jesus.  He's the guy that...  He's Jordan.  Okay.  Explain to me what Gretzky did so that I know his name.  So evidently, it's a playing thing he did.  He was Jordan.  This guy is absolutely right.  He was so much better than everybody else.  He would do what?  He was playing.  It's just skills.  Fucking skills.  That's what it is, man.  Scored relentlessly.  You've got to grow up with it, I guess.  Scored at ease.  Patrice.  Yes.  You said that you had, you know, in basketball, you had all these guys talking about  you have to skate in hockey before you can do anything else. 
[02:02:00]  I mean, that's the skill right there.  That's a...  Now, that is fucking absolutely true.  The fact that they doing shit on skates is amazing.  I will...  That is check...  Check one.  That's not what everyone should be watching.  It's not with their feet, which is tough enough.  Yeah.  If you were running around on just a fucking, you know, floor.  Right.  Do you know how amazing it is to skate as fast as you can, then stop?  That's fucking...  It is amazing. 
[02:02:30]  That's amazing.  On a fucking time.  Hockey fans, check, check.  Dude, getting back to...  Jordan?  Well, Dwayne Wade.  It's in the paper today.  And AOL kind of fucked Dwayne Wade.  At first, I was like, what the fuck was he thinking?  And then you read a little more and you realize AOL fucked him.  It's my deal here, see.  That's right.  Wade had this to say for AOL Fan House, okay?  He was quoted as saying this.  If we lose a couple in a row this season, it will be like the World Trade Center is coming 
[02:03:00]  down again.  That's like...  That's like, wow.  Obviously, it got back to Dwayne Wade's people and they're like, whoa, what the fuck?  That wasn't what he said.  You just kind of edited what he said to make it easy for your website.  What he actually said was, we're going to be wearing a bullseye, Wade reported, but that's  what you play for.  We enjoy the bullseye.  Plus, there are going to be times when we lose two, three games in a row and it seems  like the world has crashed down.  You're all going to make it seem like the World Trade Center is coming down again, but... 
[02:03:30]  And this is what AOL didn't add originally.  But it's not going to be nothing but a couple of basketball games.  That's a lot different than the original fucking thing he said.  It's completely different.  It's the opposite.  Right.  He covered his ass.  Because he said, hey, but we're doing our basketball games here.  Right.  The world...  You know, when you mention the World Trade Center, it gets everyone on edge and then  you realize he covered his ass by adding the thing, look, it's only a couple of games  in the end.  Totally.  Totally.  The fucking AOL.  What the hell?  Wow.  Trying to get him fucked. 
[02:04:00]  So...  Trying to get him fucked.  And finally, you might as well wrap up sports with Tiger cursed on TV.  So that's a big deal today, I guess.  What did he say?  I fucked.  That name followed that.  He didn't do well with the British Open.  Another major goes by and Tiger didn't win.  Huh?  He came at 13.  Something like that.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's...  Whatever.  I guess we're not to talk about golf.  Most people don't give this shit.  You don't like golf, do you, Patrice?  Do you like watching it? 
[02:04:30]  Golf and hockey is very foreign to you.  If I got any black card...  I know.  You can't.  You can't even...  Even if a lot of black people are into golf now.  Dude, who could afford to play golf growing up?  But there's a lot of golf fans.  It's just...  You know, it's an old man's game, too.  You know, I might get into it.  Tiger made it a younger man's sport, but...  True that.  In general, it's still an old guy's sport, right?  It's just that, you know...  But this is Tiger Woods from the British Open.  Woods has missed that.  You see, the wind's blowing from the right. 
[02:05:00]  You can't believe the ball should go that way.  I think that they get to the situation where you're concerned about the wind, the strength  of the wind.  Is it going to affect the ball?  How the fuck is it going to do that?  You imagine it will, and then it doesn't, and then you don't strike it as firmly as you  might do, and you miss.  He is running hot with a five par to come.  Tiger needs to get moving.  They play the music.  Cover him up.  He's fucking saying fuck.  I think there are a few in there.  I think there might have been a cocksucker in there, if you listen closely. 
[02:05:30]  Fuck.  Fuck.  Who cares?  If you're going to have live mics, you're going to hear some curses.  Of course you are.  What do you expect, a guy not to curse?  Love a cat.  Goddamn, Tiger's great.  Yeah.  To be able to fucking have people interested in that fucking...  You know how great Tiger Woods is?  I watched the British Open the entire weekend.  I get up early on the weekend, so it's right there on the TV, right?  The guy was pretty much out of it early.  Man, he got so much coverage all the way through his last fucking hole on Sunday. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, they don't care.  Usually, if a guy drops out, they're like, you don't even see him again.  You're like, what?  Did he walk off the course?  You don't even know if he's still out there.  They don't care.  But with Tiger, they show pretty much every shot he does.  Yeah.  That's how great he is.  When there was guys leading this tournament that were just blowing everyone else away,  and they continue to show you...  Boy, are they writing him off, too.  Huh?  They are writing him off.  What do you mean? 
[02:06:30]  They just...  You could see the media or whatever you're calling it.  You could just see them devising a way to have everybody say, fuck Tiger.  And the cheating thing has disappeared, but now it's the, okay, here's where all the other greats failed.  Have fucked up.  And he only has five years.  But, you know, he has more because Jack Nicholson was a...  He was a...  Nicholas.  He...  Nicholas.  I'm sorry about that. 
[02:07:00]  Nicholas or...  I did.  That was everything.  Every fucking time I have to think about it.  And you got the other great guy who's synonymous...  Palmer.  Arnold Palmer.  Arnold Palmer.  And who's the one who kind of invented golf in this country?  Ben Hogan.  These guys.  They played golf.  Here's one of the things people forget Tiger has innovated.  He innovated physical conditioning to golf.  Yeah, yeah.  Jack Nicholas was just a physical bum who was good. 
[02:07:30]  And Tiger probably has 10 more years to 15 more years to go because he's...  In shape.  He's in shape.  So they're trying to say, oh, it's over for Tiger and his chase because it's five years.  Everybody gets old at 40.  He's in better shape than any of those guys.  And he probably has those, you know, some genes, natural genes that fucking help.  So he might still...  He still has a good shot.  He has a good shot.  And he's got that big thigh muscle that the blacks have in him. 
[02:08:00]  It's that thigh muscle that was bred in during his slavery days.  Really, Jimmy the Greek?  Keep talking.  I love this.  I got the last video of Jimmy the Greek.  Ah, sure.  They breed their big buck with the big black woman.  And what they get is a stronger Negro.  Oh, bye-bye, Jimmy.  Bye, Jimmy the Greek.  Hold on.  Let's play it.  Did he get fired because it's true or he fired because he said it?  Because he said it. 
[02:08:30]  He just said it.  Here it is.  Here it is.  This goes way back.  I love this one.  For the youngsters out there, I mean, there was no one bigger than Jimmy the Greek for a while there.  Every event.  This guy was so massively huge.  Every big event that happened, they would go to the handicapper, Jimmy the Greek, to see who was going to win, what are the odds, the Belmont Stakes.  He picked the horses, the Super Bowl, the teams, the over-under, the fucking spread, everything.  Did you see 30-30, that documentary about him?  No.  They have a documentary, the ESPN 30, 30 for Fuck 30. 
[02:09:00]  And that statement was made in conjunction with the fact they were trying to get the fuck, get rid of him.  Oh, shit.  Like, at that point, he was just a crazy old coot, and it was like, oh, thank God.  CBS was like, thank God he said that shit.  Send a cameraman over there and just bait him with questions.  Yeah.  Because he was starting to dip in his popularity at that point.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well, the dip got a lot dippier.  After this.  The black is a better athlete to begin with because he's been bred to be that way. 
[02:09:30]  Because of his high thighs and big thighs, it goes up into his back.  And they can jump higher and run faster because of their bigger thighs.  This goes back all the way to the Civil War, when during the slave trading, the big, the owner, the slave owner, would breed his big black to his big woman.  So that he could have a big black kid.  Oh, Jimmy.  Even in 2010, it's uncomfortable to hear. 
[02:10:00]  The fucking cameraman.  Knowing what he had as a career.  The cameraman's jaw was on the floor.  He was like, oh, my God, I am filming the last you will ever see of Jimmy the Greek.  Your big black.  Your black is the better athlete.  All right, ready?  Can we get that?  Make that acceptable now, please.  Make that non.  Do that.  Okay?  In non-getting-fired-right-now terms.  On ESPN.  On ESPN.  On ESPN. 
[02:10:30]  Not getting fired.  We can barely do it on satellite radio.  First, you've got to start it out with this.  Some people would say.  Okay.  See, that takes your responsibility completely out of it.  Right away.  Okay.  Some people would say that a black person would make a better athlete.  Based on the...  I say I have to stop you there.  I say...  Immediately.  You...  I already went over the line.  If you agree, Gregory.  What happened?  I say right there.  Start it off again.  Some people would say...  This is trying not to get fired.  The entire statement on ESPN right now. 
[02:11:00]  Okay.  Don't get fired.  Jimmy the Greek.  Some people would say that based on history and what the black man went through...  I think I stopped you there.  Yeah, we need a buzzer.  I think you need a buzzer.  You're already fired.  We need a buzzer.  Hold on.  Let me get my buzzer out.  You're already fucking fired.  Patrice, point to me when you need the buzzer.  Wait.  I got to find my buzzer.  Go ahead, man.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I need the buzzer.  How long was that, Danny? 
[02:11:30]  Was that whole thing that he said?  No, no.  Around what?  All right.  Let's try this again.  All right.  Go ahead, Dan.  Try it again.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  How long was Jimmy the Greek staying?  Now, you have to go close to the length of Jimmy the Greek.  Yeah, yeah.  Not getting fired.  That's probably about a 30-second clip.  30 seconds?  45 seconds?  Yeah, 30 seconds.  Let's just call it 30.  Make it easy, Patrice.  30 seconds.  Make it easy.  30 seconds.  You have to survive.  30 seconds.  Wait.  Let me get my fucking... 
[02:12:00]  You got to stop.  You got to stop.  Walking on fucking racial eggshells.  I got right behind you.  Right behind you.  Okay.  Racial eggshells.  30 seconds.  Hold on.  In five, four, three, two, one.  Anthony, try not to get fired.  Go.  Some people would say that over the years, the black athlete...  You got five, six, six, six point three seconds.  You can't.  No one says black.  You fucked up already. 
[02:12:30]  All right, let's try again.  Come on.  I know my pal, I can do it.  30 seconds in five, four, three, two, one.  Go.  Some people would say that there are athletes of certain ethnic backgrounds that are better  suited for sport based on history itself and what these people went through in history.  These people.  What is that? 
[02:13:00]  Yes.  You ran.  You was in front of a row.  These.  What is it?  These are those people.  These things.  These monsters.  It's on a tightrope.  Oh, shit.  One more try.  One more try.  One more try.  Come on here.  Come on.  You got 16 seconds that time, man.  All right, five, four, three, two, one.  Go.  Some people would say. 
[02:13:30]  I did that.  Sorry.  All right, you got to try it for real.  All right, here we go.  And no.  Some people would say that there are athletes of certain ethnic backgrounds that, due to  historic circumstances, have made better athletes out of certain ethnic groups.  Um, whether it was because of a certain physical, um, uh, certain, uh, physical tasks that, 
[02:14:00]  that were, uh, uh, uh, forced upon them.  He's fired.  He's fucking, let me tell you, you're fired for, uh, for, uh, for, uh, for knowing that  you were babbling and you were trying to cover up your racism.  You're fucking finished.  He's fired for showing his panic.  He had ESPN.  You're done here at ESPN.  I've never heard so many.  I mean, I do a lot, but I've never heard Ant do I. 
[02:14:30]  One more time.  One more time.  No, he could do this.  I got it.  Jimmy, the Greeks fucking spiel.  Yeah.  Without getting fired today.  All right.  Here we go.  Hold on.  God, it was, it has to be, get your boy mad dog.  Is it, is it any, how do they touch on racial shit?  They probably just don't.  One more time, man.  You got this?  One more time.  I think I got it.  It's got it.  All right.  You got the stopwatch?  Yeah.  Here we go.  It's got it.  Okay.  Don't laugh.  You're going to root it. 
[02:15:00]  Ready?  And go.  Go.  Some people would say colored people are faster than white people.  They have an extra bone in their leg.  It's called the Negro bone.  And it makes them run faster, jump higher, and throw things further.  You want to do it with the beat, maybe?  Maybe that's what you mean.  I don't think I got it.  Those nigger elbows, boy, can they fucking throw? 
[02:15:30]  Those ashy elbows of theirs.  Oh, my God.  There's no way a white man could get away with the Jimmy the Greek speech.  We got another Jimmy the Greek clip.  Okay.  The black coaches one?  You remember this one, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You got that.  They take over coaching like everybody wants them to.  There's not going to be anything left for the white people.  I mean, all the players are black.  I mean, the only thing that the whites control is the coaching jobs.  Now, I'm not being derogatory about it, but that's all that's left for them. 
[02:16:00]  Jesus fuck.  They'll make them coaches.  Do you have the Howard Cassell one if we're going to be doing this today?  You remember what Howard Cassell?  We talked about it one time, and his son called in.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm like, look.  I love that his son listens to the show.  Look at Lawrence Taylor.  Look at that gorilla climb the Empire State Building.  The Howard Cassell thing.  Doesn't he use it like he had said that about other people, too, in the past, white or black? 
[02:16:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Imagine hearing that today.  Is that guy not?  But he says, look at that little monkey going.  I almost, a racist would never make that mistake.  Yeah, yeah.  I think Howard Cassell is, look at that little, I think everybody.  I don't think he got in trouble for it, right?  It's just.  A tad bit.  But looking back now, you go, holy crap.  At the time, he got maybe a tiny bit.  Not the word monkey out.  No.  Look at that, boop.  Well, we're sorry.  We've interrupted our programming.  And now you get in trouble on any, look at that little squirrel. 
[02:17:00]  Look at that little roach.  What is that supposed to mean?  You have to fucking, you know.  You know what?  Danny, you got to help me out, because I.  Help me out of here, Henry.  Extremely racist old radio ad.  We might as well play this now, because we're heading in that direction.  Oh, no.  What is this about?  This was an old time.  Well, back in, you know, in the day.  Marketing your product.  You're supposed to say good old before that.  Marketing your goods wasn't so politically correct as it is today.  Yeah.  And this was a radio ad. 
[02:17:30]  I believe this was a product from Australia.  This is a legitimate radio ad.  Yes, I did.  Not a go for anything like that.  At first, I wasn't sure, and I actually had to look.  Not some internet asshole out there?  No, no, no.  This was a legit product from way long ago.  I believe it originated in Australia.  I'm not going to say anything.  All right, let's take a listen to this.  You just play it.  Okay.  Nigga boy, nigga boy, nigga.  That was on a commercial?  This is legit?  You've got to be kidding me.  Hey, look, there's a ton of stuff. 
[02:18:00]  I mean, if you walk into any antique store and you'll see this stuff, there's always a little  cabinet for it all.  For all the old nutcrackers.  Nigga boy, nigga boy, nigga boy, nigga boy, nigga boy, nigga boy, nigga boy.  All the shine upon a panting handle with.  Nigga boy, nigga boy, nigga boy.  Housewives know there's nothing more to handle with.  Nigga boy, nigga boy, nigga boy.  Nigga boy's still all best in the business.  Best a lady ever had.  A nigga boy shine is the shiniest shine. 
[02:18:30]  Rags to anil and soap in every bag.  What's the brand that everyone demands?  It's nigga boy, nigga boy, nigga boy.  And what's the gentlest cleaner on your hand?  Why, nigga boy, nigga boy, nigga boy.  Nigga boy, nigga boy, nigga boy, nigga boy, nigga boy, nigga boy.  They had to come up with a jingle.  Wow.  It's pretty catchy.  A jingle that is never going to leave my head for the rest of my life.  No.  I think for the first time ever, I could look for trees in the eyes.  Wow. 
[02:19:00]  During our discussions.  Oh, dude.  I actually looked away.  That was for soap?  It was for steel wool.  Oh, steel wool?  With soap, kind of like SOS.  Oh, for the hair.  Wow.  Oh, shit.  I didn't even think of that.  With steel wool hair, nigga boy, soap.  Oh, damn.  Nigga boy with steel wool hair.  What's the, uh, is there some kind of a background on that?  Well, all I know is that it was made in Sydney, Australia.  I'm trying to locate a, uh, the actual packaging.  I have a description of the packaging. 
[02:19:30]  I don't have an actual picture of the packaging.  But it says it's an empty, uh, it's a yellow box, rather.  It says the new improved boy steel wool soap.  The soap is in the pad printed in red and black.  The picture is of a winking aboriginal boy.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, they got pretty racist over there in Australia.  Now, that was, that commercial was made, when, in 2007?  Yeah.  Seven.  Fucking.  Sons of bitches.  Australians.  Wog.  They call us.  Aye.  Nigga boy, nigga boy.  Wog soap. 
[02:20:00]  Fucking use this soap, you look like a wog.  Wash your fucking pots and pans, aye?  With some of this nigga boy stuff.  Yeah, it's like nigga hair with soap in it or something.  What?  Aye, no.  My pants got all stuck with eggs on it.  I need me some nigga boy.  Jesus.  Are you kidding me?  Well, that's what the fuck.  Fucking Australians.  Aye, no. 
[02:20:30]  Pick me up some niggas or something.  Aye, no.  Where is my aye name?  Aye, no.  I think I've got to find my aye name.  You ever try to cook up some Vegemite?  Get stuck in the bottom of your pan, you know?  You've got to break out the nigga boy.  Is that on Mel Gibson's tapes?  Ha, ha, ha, yeah.  Wash it, you cunt!  The pan!  Oh, no!  Grab the nigga boy! 
[02:21:00]  Holy shit.  You've got to be kidding me.  Aye, nigh.  Aye, nigh.  Aye, nigh.  Aye, nigh.  Aye, nigh.  Oh, those Aussies are the worst fucking racist to their fucking bone.  They really are.  And it's the whole country.  All of them.  Like, you can't find a fucking...  They don't turn their heads before they make a joke over there.  Racist as a...  You think Russell Crowe and fucking Nicole Kidman, they just have a fucking Australian mafia. 
[02:21:30]  You know Russell calls fucking Denzel a nigga when he lost to him in a training day in Gladiator.  He fucking lost to him in a training day and he's like, good.  He's clapping like on camera.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, congratulations.  And in his head, he's just singing nigga boy in his head.  Yeah, nigga boy.  Nigga boy.  Nigga boy.  Congratulations.  Great job.  Great job.  Yeah, King Kong ain't got nothing on you.  Nigga boy.  Really?  Yes, he does, nigga boy.  Oh, shit.  Fucking...  Unbelievable.  Let me go to Rob and go to school. 
[02:22:00]  Jesus.  Fucking awful.  Awful people, man.  Rob, what do you got?  Hey, guys.  Yeah, last week I did my own Mel Gibson remix.  I put it on YouTube if you guys want to hear it.  It's Peter Griffin vs. Mel Gibson remix.  It's already got like close to 200 hits.  Oh, God damn.  200 hits?  That fucking thing's going viral for you.  That's amazing.  Fuck.  All right.  That thing's going to take off any time then. 
[02:22:30]  That's a...  Hey, I'm happy with 200 hits.  Perhaps more than that.  Well, let's see how good it is, Danny.  This guy really believes in what he did.  Rape boy, rape boy.  What?  Perhaps.  I punch it out.  You found it?  Yes.  All right, let's take a listen.  He's over-inflating his hit count by just a smidgen.  Oh, really?  What has he got?  189 views.  This is taking...  He's pushing the internet by...  Oh, well...  Here it is. 
[02:23:00]  I bet this sucks.  I bet this sucks.  Hello?  You make my life so fucking difficult.  Who is this?  You have one more chance.  And I mean it.  Now fucking go if you want.  But I will give you one more chance.  Uh, okay.  At least the quality's good.  You make me want to smoke.  No.  You fucked my damn.  You care about yourself.  Yeah, you know what?  To hell with you then.  Yeah, go to hell.  Go to hell.  What the...  What?  Okay, you bastard.  You want to play rough? 
[02:23:30]  You need a fucking bat beside the head.  Holy crap.  You've got a sick mind.  You need a fucking doctor.  You need a fucking brain transplant.  You need a fucking...  You'll excuse me for being in town.  It's no D-boy.  You get it now?  What mean?  They're good cuts.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Stop it!  Stop it!  You fucking don't care about me.  I'm having a hard time.  You fucking young grub.  You bitch. 
[02:24:00]  You son of a bitch.  You almost bitch.  Oh my god.  This is so bad.  Damn.  Patrice.  What?  You hang out to me over there.  You've been drinking.  What the...  You're in my house.  So I'll call the police and tell them there's someone in my house.  You could not be more wrong.  Well, I guess I should be going.  I don't want to miss the all-you-can-eat schnitzel box.  I'll tell you, dude, the guy I just called, I'll tell you why this innately stinks. 
[02:24:30]  Yes, Patrice.  I'll tell you why.  And I'm not even...  You listen to...  It stinks so bad.  It just ruined the last hour of great radio.  I'll tell you why it stinks.  It's okay right after.  Right.  And you hate to just say somebody to put their word in.  It's the other D-boy thing.  The D-boy things are from existing audio that you can't really...  The genius of it is to take audio that is straight up from one thing and meld it into something else that's straight up from one thing. 
[02:25:00]  So when you go...  When you put Mel Gibson up against Pat O'Brien, you can't do much with it but figure out how to meld those two existing conversations into something else.  He's just using clips.  He took clips from...  There's a million episodes of The Family Guy that you could just take any word and put Peter Griffin to.  Right.  It makes no sense, though. 
[02:25:30]  It's just editing as opposed to creating something.  That's what you're going to call editing?  I know.  I mean, I'm trying to not...  Sounds like you recorded it on a wax cylinder.  I'm trying to help him why it's just...  It's just...  You could do it with the Carol Burnett show or fucking Seinfeld.  Yeah, yeah.  Who are these people?  What?  Who are these people?  It's like...  It's just...  I'm more impressed that he was able to upload that to YouTube.  Like, if you know the process to get that up online with a still picture, then you need to be able to learn how to just fade in clips and fade them out and make things a little smoother than that. 
[02:26:00]  I mean, transitions are a little rough.  Yeah.  It's just...  That's why it's just...  I think the best one that came in from the listeners was from Dan, the producer.  Oh, yeah.  The Pulp Fiction one.  Do we have that to play in a break for him?  Give him another plug.  He does radio in Vancouver, I believe.  You should have...  Eric's telling me that you have in front of you there somewhere.  All right.  Let me play that.  Let me come up.  If we're going to play listener ones... 
[02:26:30]  Listener.  Listener.  Here it is.  Okay.  We'll play this going in a break.  Let's not forget, Patrice is going to be at the Miami Improv this coming weekend.  So go see fucking Patrice.  Yes.  If you're in the Miami area.  I'm telling you, you're going to have a good time.  All right.  We'll do this.  Oh, you were finished.  Fuck you.  Well, allow me to retort.  What the fuck were you going to say?  What does Marcellus Wallace look like?  What the fuck?  What country are you from?  I want...  What ain't no country I ever heard of. 
[02:27:00]  They speak English in what?  I want...  English, motherfucker.  Describe what Marcellus Wallace looks like.  I want...  Say what again.  Say what again.  I dare you.  I double dare you, motherfucker.  Say what one more goddamn time.  I want...  Does he look like a bitch?  I want...  Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I break your concentration?  No!  And then you're telling me that I'm...  I don't remember asking you a goddamn thing. 
[02:27:30]  You ever had a big Kahuna burger?  No!  And now picking up where they left off, The O.P. and Anthony Show continues.  That Jordan thing is great.  Patrice has never heard that before.  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  I do that all the time.  Just like around the house or driving.  I'll just start going.  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  How does he shoot free throws and he can't do that?  You know what's fucked up about that?  How do you fuck that up 12 different ways? 
[02:28:00]  I don't know.  Can you fuck that up 12...  Try to fuck that up 12 different ways right now, Patrice.  I am...  Let me tell you something.  You don't want to play?  Yeah.  The morning that you go in, you expect...  You look at that and go,  Boy, this is going to be the best money I ever made for 30 seconds.  Yeah, yeah.  Gatorade, is it in you?  Yeah, you just did it.  And then you go...  You just nailed it.  Can you do it a little...  Is it in you?  Is it in you?  First, you go through all the...  The easy ones.  Yeah, yeah.  The different quotations. 
[02:28:30]  Gatorade!  Exclamation point.  Is it in you?  Question.  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  Is it in you?  Period.  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  All right, that's three, though.  Gatorade.  Is it...  In you?  Is it in you?  You sing it.  Gatorade.  How many times...  Gatorade.  Is it...  Is it...  Because he sounds like he's...  Is it...  Is it in you?  You just did five, but he did another fucking seven. 
[02:29:00]  Ah, shit.  And then you start fucking up Gatorade.  Gate.  O-Rate.  O-Rate.  It.  Gatorade it.  In fact, you just...  Gatorade it.  It.  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  Gatorade is...  Gatorade is...  In you.  In you.  So we shouldn't fault Michael Jordan?  We should fault the people?  The engineer?  Yeah.  In that situation?  Yeah, you faulted for saying...  You come in and they probably told...  Can we...  I've done this a million times where it's like...  All right, give us another read.  And, you know... 
[02:29:30]  And you go, why?  Why?  One for safety.  That's what one camera shows...  I love one camera shows.  I think they're the funniest shows.  You know, The Office and Larry Sand...  All these one camera shows.  But the thing about one camera shows is like...  It's too long.  Like, why?  Why 4,000 takes?  Just...  You don't...  Stop trying to fucking justify your existence.  I'll never...  I can't stand that.  My philosophy is that's why you don't see a lot of great comedies anymore.  Because they're too busy fucking doing the scenes over and over and over again to make 
[02:30:00]  it look right.  And then the spontaneity and the feeling is gone.  That's my theory on why...  Like, when we were growing up, it seemed like there was a new comedy popping out that everyone  loved.  And you just don't get that anymore.  And I think it's because they want to make sure the lighting's right.  And you know what I mean?  I remember recording stuff.  And you think it's hysterical.  You wrote it.  You fucking do it.  You record it.  Right.  And then after it's all mixed and arranged and everything, by the time the final product 
[02:30:30]  is done, you're like, was this ever funny?  Yep.  This stinks.  That's what happened to that pilot I did.  It's just like...  It was a vision.  Yep.  And it's just so many people that think all the funny that I do.  Yeah.  Like, that's why I'm in deep shit, I think.  Me was just talking, going to the bathroom, you know.  I'm in deep shit.  Because what I think is funny and committed to might stink.  And fuck me funny.  But just what I think is funny just ain't happening, man. 
[02:31:00]  No, it doesn't...  It's not that it stinks.  It's not what mainstream media is looking for.  Really?  50-year-old fucking hacky dude?  Really?  Really, dude?  You know what's funny?  Yeah.  This is why I get upset.  It's not sports.  I'm just going back.  There's a kid named Nate Robinson, who plays for the Celtics now.  He used to play for the Knicks, if you don't know.  Sure.  5'8", 5'9", a machine, a basketball machine. 
[02:31:30]  He's only good if there's fucking David Banner or the Hulk.  He's only good when he's the Hulk.  But these old, irrelevant guys try to make him play as David Banner.  They go, you have to calm it down.  But he's only good as the fucking Hulk.  Just let him be the Hulk.  He wouldn't have made it to the NBA if he didn't always play as the Hulk.  Leave him alone. 
[02:32:00]  So you get a guy that people go, oh, he's funny.  The guys that come on your show, me, Bob, Bill, fucking Rogan, to a lot of degrees.  Like you go, these guys fucking have been funny all their lives.  And then you get into the business part.  And Susan, head of development, thinks it's not good.  And you go, what the fuck are you talking about?  And then it's like, why did you hire me then?  Right?  Why am I here?  You could get Joe anybody to do this then. 
[02:32:30]  Holy shit.  You didn't hire me to be the Hulk like you're saying.  Yes, I'm funny because of how I've been, you know.  Hey, we're going to move on.  But we were talking about LeBron James.  And Patrice mentioned it outside the studio.  I've seen the video as well.  I don't know why we didn't bring it up when we were talking about LeBron.  The heel turn video that's up on YouTube.  I think it's hilarious.  Have you seen it, Ant?  Yeah.  You like?  I saw it when Patrice retweeted.  Yeah.  Oh, you saw it?  You watched it?  It made me laugh, man.  It's just so goofy and dumb.  Basically, it's a classic wrestling heel turn. 
[02:33:00]  But they fucking put like a LeBron James face on one of the dudes.  It's cheesy, but it's so fucking funny.  It's so cheesy, but it just works.  At its cheesiness.  Like, oh my God, what is he doing?  I've got to get something out of the way.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you. 
[02:33:30]  Happy birthday, dear Jimmy.  Happy birthday to you.  Mr. Shitty Chest.  Out of all the days that it is Jimmy's birthday, today is legitimately Jimmy's birthday.  How do we know for sure, though?  What a gift I get.  Robert Duvall photo on the way he was actually leaving. 
[02:34:00]  I caught him going out the door.  Get out.  You got a picture with Robert Duvall for your birthday.  He was walking out the door.  Will that be your best birthday present today?  Um, no, it's a cool one, but I mean, I'm really glad I came in.  Let me see it.  Yeah, Jimmy just flew in from Montreal.  And his...  Let me see.  He looks good as an old man.  He must be 80 years old.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let me see what Robert Duvall looks like now.  He's not a fucking decrepit old man.  He looks all right.  You're out, Tom.  Looks like a fisherman.  If only he was in, like, one decent movie. 
[02:34:30]  He hasn't aged in time.  He stopped.  He stopped.  He stopped after what?  Like, uh, what, Apocalypse Now?  Has it been to me since then?  It was...  He's been...  He's been...  He was in, uh...  He now plays loners now.  Lonely old coots with a gun on the porch.  Fucking...  Or a fucking...  He's still a sheriff.  He plays sheriff on Hallmark Channel movies and shit, but he's done enough where it's  like...  He doesn't need to do anything else.  He gets a pass.  He's great even in those horrible movies.  They don't make a bad movie here and there, and he's always good, man. 
[02:35:00]  He got old, young, and just stayed old looking.  He hasn't aged from that in 20 years.  He still looks good.  He still looks good.  There are old Twilight Zones that he is in that he looks old.  Yep.  Balding is a motherfucker.  He's like bald and just fucking...  And you know he was like 23?  Just horseshoe bald.  I think he deserves to be heard.  The best use of his hands in any actor in history.  He would do this thing where his hands would be out in front of him and kind of cupped 
[02:35:30]  in.  Yeah, yeah.  He had this great way of fucking...  Yeah, of using his fucking hands to...  What movie was that where he used his hands?  That was in...  With fucking Ned Beatty.  That was in Network, where he played the fucking...  Where he was...  He played the head of CA, the network, whatever.  CA...  Yeah.  It was the network.  I was just talking about it.  I forgot the...  Yeah.  He fired him.  Fucking Duvall.  Jesus.  Oh, dude.  I couldn't believe that.  He had a...  He was great in Apocalypse Now, too.  He was fucking tremendous.  Amazing.  And recently, he had a who-gives-a-shit scene in Crazy Heart, and he was great. 
[02:36:00]  I didn't see it yet.  You haven't seen it yet?  I have it, but I haven't seen it.  Is that when he played the sergeant and he was fucking with his kid?  Crazy Heart.  No, that was great, Santini.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah, Santini.  Crazy Heart was the one that won, you know, some Oscars and shit.  What's his name?  Bridges.  I wanted them to just talk to me like I was Toomer.  What did he say to you?  I want to have Toomer.  He was...  I just...  Because he was walking out with Tim Sabian, and I was...  My eyes just opened.  Who's Tim Sabian?  He runs Howardstown.  We know him from YSB.  Oh, sorry.  Okay, okay.  He's been around for years, Tim.  We know him. 
[02:36:30]  I thought there was another guy I didn't know or something.  I'm like, damn.  No, Tim's a good dude.  Oh, everyone knows everyone here.  He's fucking...  And he's walking out, and I'm like, it's Duvall.  Like, I had seen him before, but I'm like, that really is him.  Yeah, yeah.  Me and Kenny happened to walk through the fucking doors in reception, and there he was.  And I just was like, I shook his hand.  I kept a picture.  Like, there was no protocol.  I didn't even say hi to Tim.  Yeah, yeah, nothing.  And Tim's trying to duck out of the way.  Oh.  He got it.  He goes, all right, man.  Just make it fast.  It's not...  And then there was no flash happening, and I'm like, Kenny, I'm going to bite you. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, no.  He told you to make it fast?  No, but not like a dick.  He's just like, all right, just make it fast.  He wants to get out of there.  Robert Duvall?  Yeah, but he wasn't being a jerk.  He's just...  He's old.  He wants to get home.  Make it fast, lads.  Yeah.  He's one of those actors that can walk the streets by himself, you feel?  Like, I saw Joe Pesci in The Village, and he just...  Oh, yeah?  You just go, hey.  And he gets that look like, I'm not the guy that people are going to be around fucking  with on that level.  Alec Baldwin is a very in-the-street guy.  Just kind of... 
[02:37:30]  Alec Baldwin, he wanders the Upper West Side.  He's just an in-the-street guy.  He almost looks homeless, if you didn't know it was Alec Baldwin.  I've never seen him.  Who couldn't?  Oh, yeah.  I've seen him many times.  Like, what celebrity could not possibly walk the street?  I would say Brad Pitt couldn't.  I would say any in the magazines on a regular basis, guys.  And Joe Pesci was never that.  Brad Pitt could not.  I don't think George Clooney could be...  There were two...  I've seen a million celebrities, because they walked the Upper West Side a lot.  There were two that drew ridiculous crowds. 
[02:38:00]  Two.  Yoko Ono walked home from the movie theater once.  What gives a fuck about Yoko?  People were out of their minds running out of every fucking store.  Because you had Glennon's dick in her.  That's the only reason.  It was Yoko, and the only other one was Keanu Reeves.  But then again, he was wearing a long fucking Matrix fucking black coat in the middle of summer.  So I think that alone made people go, what the fuck?  But they came...  I think the Beavers, the singers probably can't.  Huh?  I don't think the singers...  I think Justin Bieber can't.  And I don't think Lady Gaga can. 
[02:38:30]  Know who I saw walk around like, and no one gave a shit?  Dustin Hoffman.  Wow.  Yep, he's won.  He's won how?  He walked around with a thing of flowers that he got from the corner bodega, wandering around  just looking up in the air.  I think we talked about this on the air.  And no one bothered him whatsoever.  There's an energy, man.  And Joe Pesci had an energy of, you know, Ice Cube used to do a rap, you know, long ago.  He goes, shake my...  When you see me in the street, shake my hand and make it a firm shake.  Say, what up, Ice Cube?  It didn't break. 
[02:39:00]  Because if you're hanging there, I'm going to tell you loud and clear, get off my dick,  nigga, and tell your bitch to come here.  So Joe Pesci gives that kind of vibe where it's like, you just go, hey, Joe.  And he just goes, hi.  He goes, it's the bitches that are bitches.  Yep.  You just keep it moving.  Dustin Hoffman got that.  I hate to tell you, Yoko drew a crowd, man.  People were out of their fucking minds.  Yeah, they fucking didn't want to touch John Lennon juice, man.  Supposedly she doesn't walk often.  She, like, called off her driver and then me as a creep, I just fucking followed her home.  Is that the driver that was recording her?  I'm sure she appreciates that, huh? 
[02:39:30]  I wonder if that was the driver that was recording her.  There was that secret guy secretly taping her.  She was in the same movie theater when I saw, I think it was, yeah, Grizzly Man.  And I'm in the bathroom and fucking Sean Lennon's in the bathroom.  I'm like, holy shit.  Grizzly Man?  So I go to my...  Huh?  I think just making jokes about Yoko's horrible speech.  Oh, shit.  Grizzly.  Grizzly.  Grizzly.  So all of a sudden, I'm in the bathroom with Sean Lennon.  I'm like, holy shit.  I tell my girl.  And sure enough, you know, he's hanging with Yoko. 
[02:40:00]  And they called off their driver and then started walking down Broadway.  That's like seeing Priscilla Presley.  I bet you Priscilla Presley gets bothered because she got, she got, I mean, I would, at this  point, John Lennon is bigger than Icon.  I mean, you get, you get John Lennon aura on you.  People, a lot of people are creeping, creepy when it comes to that posthumous shit.  Elvis stink.  Oh, Elvis stink.  Oh, Elvis stink.  Michael Jackson stink is going to be huge soon.  You know who used to walk around the neighborhood and no one bothered him?  Conan O'Brien.  He gives off that vibe, man. 
[02:40:30]  Not a one.  And I bet you Lennon walks around with no one fucks with him.  I bet you.  But it's different.  New York and L.A. we're talking.  But in fucking Ohio, you know, none of these people can walk around.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But who's the, Lennon seems accessible.  The people, he speaks to people.  Yeah, he seems like he can walk through the streets.  Letterman doesn't.  Letterman couldn't because I think Letterman seems like too inaccessible.  Who the fuck is the guy from Ghostbusters, the nerd?  Bill Murray?  Harold Ramis?  Howard Ramis?  Rick Moranis.  Rick Moranis?  Seeing him a million fucking times, no one bothers him. 
[02:41:00]  No one cares.  By the way, that's not the Rick Moranis movie you access to make safe for people.  I know, I know, I know.  It's like, honey, I blew up the kids.  I know, you're right.  But you know what?  He's to the point where no one even cares.  They don't even look.  Oh, he is almost done point.  They don't even look.  Yeah, he is.  At least Dustin Hoffman, they were looking, but weren't bothering.  There's a whole thing.  He's at that level where it's, oh, shit.  He produced Godfather 12.  It's at the point where you, I just found out something interesting. 
[02:41:30]  I didn't know, and this might be all white news, but I didn't know that your girl, I was watching a movie called Prophecy.  It's an old horror movie.  What's the girl, the sister from the Godfather?  Oh, Talia Shire.  I didn't fucking know she was your boy's sister.  Oh, right.  Francis Ford Coppola.  Coppola.  This family's a mafia.  Yeah.  I didn't realize these motherfuckers were so indigenous.  Yeah, yeah.  To Hollywood.  Yeah, and Nicolas Cage. 
[02:42:00]  Nicolas Cage is part of that whole thing, too.  I don't hear shit about the Wayans brothers.  These motherfuckers, the Coppolas are nepotism in this business to the fucking 10th degree.  Goddamn royalty.  And he has his brother, Francis Ford's other, his uncle, used to do all the music from the fucking movie.  I was like, what the fuck?  Wikipedia has the Coppola family tree.  I'm not upset about it.  It's just, I didn't realize these motherfuckers were so dug in.  Why did Nicolas Cage use his last name? 
[02:42:30]  I know.  He didn't want the Coppola name.  He wanted to do it on his own.  Why would you want the Coppola name?  I think I remember reading something about that, and he wanted to do it on his own.  Yeah, fuck that.  I would trade in the Hughes name in a second.  I want to change my name to Coppola.  Yeah, exactly.  I think I want to do it now.  See, but he had the option.  If Nicolas Cage fucking flopped, he'd be Nicolas Coppola in a second.  Nicolas Coppola Cage, like Cougar Mellencamp.  Yeah, exactly.  That's the family tree.  Anything on there?  But Talia Shire.  We're talking about Jason Schwartzman.  She wasn't Talia Coppola ever. 
[02:43:00]  No, no.  Ever was she Talia Coppola.  His daughter was Coppola.  Yeah.  Now she's big time director, but when she was Coppola, she single-handedly almost destroyed  the Godfather.  Oh, the franchise.  She almost wrecked it.  Oh, what a mess.  You said Jason Schwartzman.  That's Talia Shire's son.  He stars in-  Yeah, I didn't fucking know that.  Yeah.  Yeah, he stars in Border Death.  And he got another brother.  He was in Rushmore, obviously.  I didn't see Rushmore.  Rushmore is a good movie.  He was in I Heart Huckabees.  Yeah, I liked the Rushmore, man. 
[02:43:30]  He was good in that one.  Motherfucker, boy.  I'm sorry.  I didn't know that.  Anyone else on that family tree?  Look at the family tree.  That's pretty-  Jesus Christ.  All in Hollywood, probably.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That's a family tree without a whole lot of nuts on it, right?  Happy birthday, Chip.  Yes.  Holy shit, man.  We also have Randy Couture.  That's why he came back from Montreal, huh? 
[02:44:00]  Oh, yeah.  I also don't want to miss if I don't have to.  Like, tomorrow I do, and then I got to go to L.A., so I don't want to miss days, but  I don't have to.  But it's your birthday.  I know.  Randy Couture's coming in, and Terry Crews from the Old Spice commercial.  That's how I know him.  He's also in Everyone Hates Chris, right?  He's the father.  Oh, he's been around a long time, man.  But now we all know him from the Old Spice commercials.  He's coming in.  And he's doing Ice Cube's new show on TBS.  He's a TV show?  Yeah, Ice Cube.  He's another father.  He's a father again.  And he's in The Expendables, Terry Crews and Randy Couture. 
[02:44:30]  I think that's going to be a halfway big movie.  Like, middle big.  Like, A-team.  Almost big?  Almost big.  Almost big.  What did A-team do numbers-wise?  What, did it do?  60?  Did well, right?  I think it did okay.  Which is that?  Well, The Expendables got Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Jason Statham.  That means this movie's going to suck.  You don't like Jason Statham?  No, no, not because of Jason Statham.  There's too many big fucking names. 
[02:45:00]  75.  Usually the movies with a lot of big names don't do well.  I don't think they're as nostalgic as they think they are.  I don't think they came together on this nostalgia kind of coming back thing.  But I don't think that they're...  I think the only one that's nostalgic might be Schwarzenegger and Stallone.  But the rest are pretty existing now.  Dolph Lundgren.  Yeah, yeah.  He's been doing movies.  Jet Li.  Retrograde.  Jesus, yeah.  Eric Roberts, who's a great actor. 
[02:45:30]  Underrated, by the way.  Great.  One of the great fucking, for the time that he was, great.  Should have been way bigger than he was.  Actors.  Ten minutes.  What happened?  Fuck.  I don't know.  Did he do a drug thing or something?  I don't know.  Something happened with him.  He should have been in a million great movies.  Better than fucking...  Better than Stacey Keech and Joaquin Phoenix, man.  Oh, yeah.  Joaquin.  Greatest hair lip actor of our time?  Of our time.  The greatest hair lip actor. 
[02:46:00]  Him and Star 80.  Fucking Cheech.  Doesn't even have a...  It's a knuckle on his mouth.  That's terrible.  Fucking...  I don't remember Star 80 anymore.  I haven't seen that movie in years.  Star fucking 80.  The thing he did with Jon Voight was to run away train.  I didn't know he had a hair lip.  Oh, yeah.  He was in...  Yeah, he got a hair lip.  Pope of Greenwich Village.  Pope of Greenwich Village.  He was Charlie.  They took my thumb.  He was that guy.  And Mickey Rourke, by the way.  Another guy that...  But we know what happened to Mickey, but...  He's got a hair face. 
[02:46:30]  Oh.  Looks like Lil' Kim.  The Iron Man, the second movie come out, and I missed it.  It made about a good 300, 400, maybe more.  Was it good?  Or was it a bomb?  Yeah, people loved it.  People loved it.  He wasn't a bomb.  What the fuck happened?  You just missed it.  Oh, I think I had a kid somewhere in there.  Yeah, I might have done it.  I'm finally coming out of the fog.  I just realized I missed the Iron Man sequel.  What the fuck?  I hate how people go away and come back, though.  Meaning...  Yeah.  How they control that.  It's like Mickey Rourke, gone.  Now he's back. 
[02:47:00]  He did The Wrestler.  And now that fucking mashed...  No, no, no.  Sin City...  Sin City kind of brought the side.  Kind of brought him back a little bit.  That was a while ago, too.  Then he did The Wrestler, which super brought him back.  Now he's like villains in movies.  He was playing himself in The Wrestler.  Was that impressive?  Yeah.  It was a great movie.  It's fucking very hard to play yourself, I think.  It's still okay if you play yourself.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I saw a movie called Rampage over the weekend.  Who was in that?  It was like fucked up.  I don't know.  There's like no people I've ever seen in it. 
[02:47:30]  But it's this young guy and he just, he's like just inundated every day by the news and the horribleness and everything.  And he just fucking puts on this armored, goddamn bulletproof suit and goes out and fucks up his hometown, his small hometown.  Is it like falling down?  It's like falling down, but 80 times more on crack.  Yeah.  80 times more violent and heinous. 
[02:48:00]  Anything on crack.  Like there's one scene where he's standing there and he's got two like Uzis and this complete fucking suit where cops can just shoot at him.  Is this a made for DVD thing?  I don't know where the fuck it came from.  Where did you see it?  I never heard of it.  A pay-per-view.  I think the same guy did that, did the Chronicles of Jerry Sherbert.  Jerry Sherbert.  It's just a bad name for a movie.  Of course it is.  That's horrible.  Well, why don't we know this movie? 
[02:48:30]  He walks up to this chick at some point.  Are you a violent movie enjoyer?  I love that shit.  Please watch the newest Punisher.  Yeah?  Punisher?  The newest Punisher.  Warzone.  Enjoy the newest Punisher.  If you like violence, fantastically violent.  Rampage, can't find it?  Well, we find the Rampage, but not Rampage the movie.  You gotta put Rampage, like 2010, when did they make it?  This fucking chick, it's new, is cowering in a corner because they've told everybody that this guy's like fucking this town up. 
[02:49:00]  And she's cowering in this corner and the guy just kind of loads his gun up and goes off.  Oh, hey.  Hi.  Okay, I'm looking at the trailer.  Pretty bad, huh?  He already has indie hair.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He has independent film hair.  He does.  This just means it might be good.  Why haven't we heard this one?  You're so precious, aren't we?  Everyone's gotta live.  Everyone's gotta be happy.  He looks like Adam Baldwin. 
[02:49:30]  It's a joke.  It's an absolute joke.  You think people are equal?  They're not.  They're not.  He plays a good psychopath.  Yes.  I mean, that's my plan.  That's what I want to do.  Let's just clean the world.  So maybe the rest of us can sustain a little bit of life.  These people are about to kill us.  I just got a montage thing happening here. 
[02:50:00]  I feel a little fancy.  Working out.  He puts his fucking shit together.  Gets his guns and just fucking...  Yeah.  Sculpting finger painting.  The end of all time.  And there's no chance we can survive.  The violence is amazing. 
[02:50:30]  It just shoots the shit out of people.  With no mercy.  You know why this is violent right away?  They show the death in the trailer.  Yeah, no shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But how's...  Oh, of course!  Uwe Boll.  We had him in.  Oh, good old Uwe.  Uwe Boll.  Uwe Boll. 
[02:51:00]  Uwe Boll.  Of course that's him.  We had him in.  That crazy German director.  What was he in for again?  The movie he did where they chose the plane hitting the trade center?  Yeah, I think it was based off a video game called Postal.  Postal, yes.  Right, right, right.  Very good, Danny.  Yeah, one part...  He doesn't fucking hold back.  One part, he fucking stabs this cop in his liver and then pulls it out and the cop's  just kind of fucking dying there, laying there.  And he just leans over and goes, it'll take about eight seconds.  Like, tells him, you know, you'll be dead in about eight seconds. 
[02:51:30]  Don't worry about it.  Just fucking...  I'm watching this going, this is so fucking bad.  How was it twisted?  How was the story, though?  You know what?  Was the storyline good?  It's got...  You know what?  I'm gonna...  Wikipedia it.  It's got it.  It's got a fucking twist to it.  Better than Taken?  What wasn't?  I didn't like the...  Me and Patrice loved the Taken.  The lack of soy sauce hair.  Every time I see that fucking movie, I'll pop it on every so often when it's on. 
[02:52:00]  And all I can think of is Jimmy Sane.  I'm not saying that...  This asshole...  Died his hair with soy sauce.  I'm not saying that...  And he didn't ruin it for me.  He just ruined his hair.  But he ruined Face Off for me.  But he didn't ruin Taken.  Taken still, I love Taken.  I'm not saying that Taken didn't have problems, but it's still...  Like retard run daughter?  I want a pony!  Jesus, I gotta watch fucking Rampage.  No wonder, though, it'll never be big because of society now and a lot of violence.  And Uwe Bola, however you say his name, makes really controversial flicks, that guy. 
[02:52:30]  He sure does.  Hey, Danny, can you find the scene he did where there's a window washer and a plane in his head?  It wasn't the trade center.  It was just a window washer.  And it gave him a lot of shit.  And you know what?  Someone came up with Departed, so I'm wrong.  But I think movies where they get the huge all-star, over-the-top cast, they usually don't do well.  But, you know, Departed obviously did great.  Yeah, maybe The Godfather, maybe, sneaking in there.  Yeah, but were those guys all stars when that movie came out?  They absolutely, I would say they were, yeah.  Okay.  What is this, Postal Clip? 
[02:53:00]  Oh, shit.  Wow.  Wow.  That just made my stomach hurt.  This guy is great.  Yeah, he wasn't fucking around.  Show that again in the beginning.  Oh, I gotta fucking...  What if you were a window washer?  How the fuck do you film this?  That's some CGI shit, motherfucker.  No, I understand what it is, but that looks way too fucking...  Hold on, stop this right there.  Stop it, stop it right there. 
[02:53:30]  First of all, first of all, what you just said just now matches my fuck up the other day and Jimmy's.  I don't want you to be able to get past the fact that you fucking said, hey man, CGI.  I said CGI.  Fucking asshole.  See, they really crashed the plane into the guy.  Really?  Really?  George Lucas, that fucking beats my stupid shit and trumps his stupid shit.  It ties it.  Thank you. 
[02:54:00]  It really does.  I'll give us a three-way tie.  Man, we've come a long way since fucking silent films.  Really?  If you notice, Fatty Arbuckle.  Really, Sesame?  Fatty Arbuckle's flying the plane.  I just wanted to let you know I caught CGI, you asshole.  I caught Mary Pickford as the window watcher.  This is scary, man.  This makes my stomach tight.  There's actually...  Go ahead, let it go.  There's a fucking...  There's a special on the towers falling.  Did you ever hear the story of the guy who was in the fucking, like, the 92nd floor? 
[02:54:30]  He's fucking Illmatic, man.  And the plane came in and it actually hit right above him in his floor.  It's a true story.  He lived.  The plane came...  You guys have seen him interviewed, I'm sure.  No, I haven't.  I gotta check it out.  Is it online?  And there's a graphic of it.  They actually show you what it might have looked like, because he's telling the story  about how I looked out the window and the plane was there.  Like, he saw the plane heading, and when it came in, it, like, crashed the floor above  him.  But I guess the damage was so...  He was right there, so the damage went beyond him, I guess. 
[02:55:00]  But you should look him up.  Jesus, get the fuck out of here.  It's on YouTube, and they show the graphic of what he saw coming in.  Get them.  Wow.  And it's really fucking chilling.  What is this movie, Postal, about?  I don't know.  I just...  I know he got a lot of shit for that.  But I thought that was well shot.  That looked amazing, man.  It wasn't like he was goofing on it.  Jesus, that hurt.  Pretty good.  That just hurt.  Just now.  It was too fast.  It just hurt.  Ouch.  Like that fast shit.  God damn it. 
[02:55:30]  I think a disturbing scene in a movie was Fight Club, when Edward Norton's in the plane,  when it just gets broadsided by the other plane.  Oh, yeah.  And people are getting sucked out.  He has the fantasy that he wishes that every time he flies there would be a mid-air collision  or some shit.  And it just looks...  Yeah.  And, of course, Danny gets it in two seconds.  Every time the plane banked too sharply on takeoff or landing, I prayed for a crash or  a mid-air collision.  Anything.  Anything.  Life insurance pays off triple if you die on a business trip. 
[02:56:00]  That's well shot.  See, that's fucked up, right?  It's fucked up.  The whole side of the plane opens up.  But I'll tell you something.  You can't really get the full effect of that just watching a clip.  Like, one time, I used to do this.  I used to have a car with a really nice sound system.  I was into that at the time.  And sometimes I would take my laptop and I'd watch movies in my car because it sounded  really good. 
[02:56:30]  That fucking scene...  Do you understand how psychotic that is?  Thank you, Jimmy.  I don't know.  Trust me.  But it sounded fucking ridiculous.  Like, I've seen this a thousand times and that fucking scene scared the shit out of  me.  By the way, that's a man who's heavily into kiddie porn.  How do you sit in the laptop?  How do you sit in the car with a laptop?  Yeah, you're not watching.  In the woods.  I had to live with my grandfather for a while.  It was full of roaches and dirt.  I didn't like it.  Oh, was it really?  We used to talk about you living with him.  That goes back a while.  The more time I spent outside of that apartment was more beneficial.  Danny and his vehicle. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, I spent a lot of time in my car.  Oh, my God.  That is really psychotic because there's a good sound.  How'd you hook the laptop into the fucking...  With one of those tape adapters.  Jesus.  You guys want a break so we get ready for Terry Crews and Randy Couture?  Speaking of movies, they're promoting The Expendables.  Can I say one thing before we break?  Yeah.  Two things I watched.  I did a gala last night in Montreal.  It was good.  I went on.  It was a little late and it was hot and whatever.  And fucking Panette went on.  And John Panette, I hadn't watched...  I've never seen Panette for more than a minute, like in a clip. 
[02:57:30]  He is fucking awesome.  I'm not breaking ground by saying that, but I watched him get a standing ovation and I  had just worked the crowd.  Like, I saw they were tired.  It was hot.  He is fucking unbelievable.  That son of a bitch.  Really?  Is he fat again, too?  He's fat, but he's not like he used to.  He's nowhere near what he used to be.  Yeah.  He got the stomach stapling and went down to like a sickly size.  And then he went down to a sickly size.  Obligated to do it now. 
[02:58:00]  Dude, he fucking closed with a bit on gluten.  It may be an old bit.  He made gluten funny.  I couldn't believe that he was making gluten...  I couldn't make gluten funny if I smeared it on a retarded girl's tits while I fucked  her.  He made it fucking...  You kind of made it funny there, Jimmy.  But he made a really smart, funny bit on gluten and he closed with it.  Is this Terry Crews?  Should we bring him right in?  No, it's fucking Dak from Enemy Mine.  It's fucking...  It's Richard Steele from the Republican Party. 
[02:58:30]  Ali Selassie.  Yeah, it's a fucking Ethiopian nickel.  That guy looks like.  So, John Panette funny.  What was the second thing?  Oh, I went...  I was on YouTube.  I was watching a little bit of Panette last night.  I couldn't believe...  Like, I knew he was funny, but...  I gotta check him out now.  ...to do after the show because of you guys.  But I watched Rickles in 85 go up at Reagan's inaugural...  Oh, Rickles is the king.  I'm pissed that he's too old for us to completely appreciate.  Dude, it was Reagan's inauguration. 
[02:59:00]  It was all of Washington.  It was a massive 5,000 feet.  Could you get that?  That's worth playing.  Fuck it.  I don't know if it'll translate without being...  Let's try.  Don Rickles.  He was 1985, Reagan, inaugural.  A million years ago.  But when you just see the way this guy worked in front of the president and the entire...  He was just fucking amazingly funny.  But you got...  You know, they were all friends, though.  Oh, yeah, right.  They did those roasts.  So that's...  It's less intimidating.  It's like...  He roasted him right.  Yeah, he's buddies with...  He was buddies with Reagan back then.  But it's still the president and the fucking... 
[02:59:30]  You know...  Rickles is an animal, man.  Fucking animal.  Yeah, I'm not dismissing...  You know, I'm just saying...  You know...  Yeah, and the comedians...  Little Webster, uh...  Oh, Webster, right.  Little Webster.  Oh, Rickles looks old in 85.  Does he make a joke about the little colored kid?  Be funny.  It's Little Webster.  Hands Rickles the microphone.  Look how old Rickles was already in 85.  Yeah.  25 years ago.  First black kid I ever saw. 
[03:00:00]  He'll definitely never play basketball.  That was short.  I destroyed.  I asked you, huh?  40 million stars.  I get a little kid out here.  Doesn't know what time it is.  And brings me out.  And you're standing here with the band.  With the same cockamamie music.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Try to learn that the president's here.  He's a big shot for me.  Last night we had Bush.  Well...  Well, I'll tell you this.  He was great.  Did you see him and the wife after the show?  He was in the lobby going,  Nobody knows me. 
[03:00:30]  I gave him a cookie.  He went away.  He didn't know what time it was.  It's time for going.  I'll tell you this.  Just see some of his movies?  Steps.  I'll tell you this.  How this guy became president.  When he was governor,  I couldn't get in touch with him.  I had a cousin.  Did three months.  Three months in a county jail.  I made a phone call.  I said, give me a break.  He was too busy.  Tied up.  Wouldn't make that.  He's now doing 14 years  and he's the president of the United States  sitting in the White House  with Nancy walking around going,  Art Rickles' cousin is doing a lot of time. 
[03:01:00]  Good evening, Mr. President.  Nice to see you, sir.  And your lovely wife, Nancy.  It's a big treat for me  to fly all the way to California  to be here for this kind of money.  Fucking...  I gotta interrupt.  We gotta stop because...  Reagan's roaring.  He really was.  Reagan loved him.  Yeah.  Best timing ever, though, Rickles.  We got a commotion outside the...  Yes.  What's going on?  What do we got?  What do we got?  I don't even know who we got.  I see women.  Hello.  Oh, you see Terry Crews? 
[03:01:30]  I have no idea.  Who's here, Steve?  Is Terry and Randy?  All right on.  Bring him right in.  Fuck, I want to break.  Randy.  Randy, how are you?  See you, man?  What's up, my man?  How you doing, man?  How you doing?  How you doing?  Terry, how you doing?  How you doing?  What's up, Randy?  All right, Terry Crews.  Good to see you again.  How you doing?  What's up, Terry?  How you doing?  What's up?  What's up?  I want to do a little of that.  What's up, man?  Take the couch.  Wow.  There are introductions.  Oh, there we go.  How many people?  There are so many people here.  That's big boys. 
[03:02:00]  There we go.  Thanks, man.  And let's go take the couch.  This is Jet Li's wife in the movie.  Of course.  Makeup for the radio.  Holy fuckballs, man.  You have fucking changed, nigga.  Holy shit.  We probably went it up here, baby.  That's how we do it.  Terry Crews is getting makeup for his radio appearance.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Shit.  Shit.  More shit. 
[03:02:30]  Shit.  You got muscles on your muscles and your abs and your shit.  Did you just...  Yeah.  And I exfoliate everything, too.  Long way from T-Money, man.  I know.  And I was a bail and say, start off,  that was one of my favorite shows when it was on.  Battle Dome?  Battle Dome.  Yeah.  And you played T-Money.  And if you didn't see Battle Dome,  it was like American Gladiators meets wrestling,  almost, where it's like you...  What was one of my favorite things back then is you had a fight. 
[03:03:00]  They did this cross promotion with WCW.  Yeah.  And I always wanted to ask you is that you...  Did you really punch Steiner in his face?  Yeah.  Straight up.  He...  They was doing this cross thing with WCW.  Wow.  With WCW.  And he punched...  Was it a mistake or...  He really punched another wrestler.  Straight up.  And it just looked real.  And it looked like you heard him.  And it looked like he said,  what the fuck... 
[03:03:30]  What'd you do that for?  We really...  The thing was with me is that I always took it a little too far.  Just with the whole...  On the show, too, by the way.  On the show.  There were times where...  We were just regular people, Terry.  Yeah.  Now you're getting fucking makeup on radio.  You ain't shit.  I just want to say that.  You came along with knocking motherfucking real dudes out  to make up on the radio, man.  God damn it.  Money makes you feel better, doesn't it?  Dude, I get mani-pedis and everything. 
[03:04:00]  Oh, shit.  I'm sorry, though.  But I was a big fan of that show.  They had to cancel it, man,  because people were getting broke up.  I mean, I was one of the cats that survived.  It was that extreme.  And then once they knew you were on our name  and then people were training just to get you,  it just got too violent.  It was crazy.  I remember that show, though.  If you ever...  It's a great...  I've been...  That was the first time I noticed we were on.  Then it's just...  Hollywood is one of those places... 
[03:04:30]  So you see...  Once you see somebody...  Yeah.  ...you see what the progression is.  Well, they keep...  You do see.  You do see, man.  You know, I did a...  I was extra in training day.  And so when you see training day now...  I fucking...  You know what I mean?  You didn't say a fucking word.  The leader of either the Bloods or the Crips was like...  I was in the gang.  You was part of him, but that guy was real.  I was...  All...  No.  Everybody else in the jungle was real.  All the other gangsters were real.  I came to visit the set to watch Denzel.  And literally, the director, Antoine Foucault, was like, 
[03:05:00]  Hey, man.  You want to be in this movie?  And I'm like...  Yeah.  He said, look, take your shirt off.  We're going to the roof.  I go to the roof.  I'm the guy with the pigeons.  The whole thing.  You were the pigeon guy?  That's me.  If you see the lumpy head, that's me.  I was the pigeon guy.  You were flipping pigeons?  Flipping pigeons.  Oh, shit.  That's Terry Crews.  I fucked.  Flipping pigeons.  In a world.  You were the pigeon flipper?  I'm the pigeon flipping brother.  That's it.  That's me.  Holy shit.  That's me.  I go...  And I'm going to tell you something else.  In movies, I noticed this about maybe a year ago. 
[03:05:30]  You know, in any time you see someone who's playing a gangster  who looks really mean,  real gangsters, like, if you watch American Gangster,  they never have a mean face.  You see Randy's face?  Like, the comfort of either killing you with his hands  or I'll shoot you immediately makes you easy.  You were the meanest face, motherfucker, on there.  And I'm getting makeup on the radio now. 
[03:06:00]  He will kill you.  He's smiling and he will destroy you.  Do you fight mixed martial arts at all or no?  No.  No.  I'm the NFL guy.  I played seven years in the NFL.  Ram.  Rams, Packers, Chargers, Redskins, Eagles.  Wow.  But you were really a beast in, like, college, though, right?  Yeah.  I did my thing, man.  I did my thing.  I'm still...  You know, it's all for looks.  That's it, man.  You know?  Abdominals.  That's me.  Let me ask you this, man.  This is...  And this is...  Oh, shit. 
[03:06:30]  How do I ask this shit?  This is...  You know, black people always have...  We can't be as free as white people.  Meaning, white people can do anything  and they get to just do anything.  Was there any of that fucking blackness question  when you had to get naked almost?  Oh, yeah.  When you go, man, I'm...  Am I up here with just muscles, naked, and shorts?  You turn around, everything has to be Martin Luther King Jr.  that you are now representing all black men. 
[03:07:00]  Right!  When you put on these red shorts, you do understand that you...  And I'm like, yo, man, no.  Exposure!  I just said...  You have to admit...  I don't give a damn.  If black people voted, which one of you they would want to represent the men?  They're going to vote for him.  Well, the man part...  But I'm saying the point...  See, this is...  The point is, like, the blockage meaning...  Okay, Jim Carrey...  If you go, hey, Jim, you want to put this, um...  Shit costume on?  And tap dance with a feather?  It's like, in your ass?  I'm gonna do it! 
[03:07:30]  And it's no block, but it's like...  It's...  You know the NAACP?  You see...  Just...  And he's in...  In...  In...  Fair Condition...  And the other motherfucker that's riding...  The naked guy riding the horse and...  It's just like...  You know black people go, why is this nigga naked?  And it's like, you have that...  That block that keeps...  That has to make...  So I was wondering if you had to have that...  You go, alright, family...  Then...  I don't want NAACP fucking with me.  How is that...  I don't.  I do what I love. 
[03:08:00]  I do what I want to do.  If I think it's funny, if I think it's great, I'm gonna do it.  And, you know, I mean, that's the thing.  You can never...  Let me tell you, my wife is not black enough for some people.  You know what I mean?  Is she black, your wife?  No, she's black.  No, she's black.  She's black.  But she's half white.  So in this country, that makes you black.  Obama's black, you know.  I got a half white girlfriend, too.  But your wife looks Spanish or something.  But she's half black.  She's black.  She's from Gary, Indiana.  We'll cut you in a minute.  I mean, no one is a swing or knife.  You know what I mean?  So...  But this is the thing. 
[03:08:30]  If you do all that stuff, and then you cannot please this segment right here,  and then you go too far over here, you can't please this segment.  But see, the thing is, I've had a trick in that I've been able to do everything.  Everybody hates Chris.  They're like, oh, boy, you're a black father.  We love you.  And then I can go do Idiocracy and be the black president that's just crazy.  And then you can go do White Chicks.  Goddamn, you are working.  And then now, with this Expendables, it's about the whole action movie genre.  And literally, this thing is the dream of my life. 
[03:09:00]  I always wanted to run with the gun.  I always wanted to work with real, real tough cats like Randy.  This has got to be the greatest movie set of all.  Just, let's be honest, man.  I was watching the trailer of Who's In It.  Theoretically, I would say you are the toughest dude on the set.  Now, in reality, who's second and who'd you give that look to? 
[03:09:30]  Like, you know what, I'm going to taste you because I know you want to taste.  Like, who's the guy that really is a Dolph or is it Jet Li who you go, you know what, I'll fuck you up, man.  I think Dolph is probably the only other guy that's really had any combative sports.  He's a fighter, right?  Yeah, exactly.  Fucking Dolph Lundgren's a fucking fighter, man.  He had his trainer there, a Bulgarian cat that he did.  He's still a martial arts guy?  Yeah, he's still a trainer.  Can you take him?  We never got to hook up. 
[03:10:00]  Wait a minute.  But you fucking, you wanted to taste him.  Come on, Randy.  You wanted to fucking taste him, though.  Just to go really, really fucking Ivan Drago up, but I'll punch you right in the fucking mouth right now.  No, no, no.  I was trying to start fights on the set.  I would bump somebody.  Hey, man, Dolph said something about you, dog.  Hey, Jet Li over there, he looking at you, man.  You know, I wanted to see something break off.  Was it a prison feel?  Meaning, like, did it get manly?  Meaning that thing where you go, you felt a little tension, like, this is not... 
[03:10:30]  And I never felt that.  Well, you never felt that because you don't care.  Like, if someone jumped off, it's like, fuck you.  It's time to smile and go.  Just soak out Stallone and hear him just...  No, but everybody on this set had nothing to prove.  You know what I'm saying?  That's the thing.  Everybody had...  Nobody had to prove they were tough, you know, prove that they'd done something.  You know, everybody had their scars, and my lip was all broke up and scarred up. 
[03:11:00]  Everybody had their thing, and it was...  Like Jaws and shit, where it was like, I don't want to get this one here.  BJ Penn, yeah, right there.  Right there.  Fucking, yeah.  I was.  Right.  When you say that, I would agree.  Y'all get along?  Absolutely.  You guys get along?  That's my man.  That's my man.  We were in the trenches together.  I'll tell you why you get along, too, because you guys are doing the tour together.  The guys that got along are doing the tour, so fucking Dolph is probably with fucking 
[03:11:30]  Jason Statham.  Both of them look like they swim, and they're fucking from England or wherever the fuck  they're from, so they're doing their shit together.  Stallone and fucking Schwarzenegger.  The European style.  Yeah, everybody kind of twisted off into...  Right, right, right, right, right, right.  I bet you that shit is...  It looks like it's going to be good, too.  How big is Schwarzenegger's part in it?  Because they're actually making a big deal because he's finally doing a film again.  Well, I think the biggest thing is that those three, Bruce Willis, Schwarzenegger, and  Stallone, have never been on film together in the same movie, ever.  And they're three huge actions. 
[03:12:00]  Who's the last one?  Schwarzenegger, Stallone, and Bruce O'Connor.  Right.  Three huge action stars in the same scene.  But now they have to come together like LeBron James, Dwayne, like Chris Bosh.  I don't know.  Three James.  So they have to come together.  Holy shit.  What's that you got to do to make a movie now, though?  I mean, all movies are like that right now, you know?  Freaking Sex and the City, you got to team up to make a, you know...  I would love to see you guys have knocked the shit out of those chicks.  That would have been a great movie.  I tell you right now, you know, put those things in the movie... 
[03:12:30]  You put both of those movies in the multiplex, you're going to have a baby.  You know what I mean?  You're going to have a baby.  It's like Expendables and Sex and the City.  Yeah.  Well, you could have thrown a saddle on Sarah Jessica Parker and ridden her around.  Randy, what was that last movie you...  What was the movie you did?  The last movie you did.  Red Belt.  Red Belt.  Good movie.  I didn't mind Red Belt at all.  Yeah.  Chiwetel.  Chiwetel.  Akeem Olajuwon.  What's his name?  How you pronounce it?  Chiwetel.  Chiwetel.  I refuse to even figure out...  The motherfucker better have a nickname at some point. 
[03:13:00]  I'm not going to pronounce your African name exactly.  Really?  You got to keep your African name Chiwetel?  With all these fucking Jews around, he got to keep Chiwetel?  What the hell?  Change that name to Chewy Johnson, motherfucker, for you to get a job.  He's fucking getting his jobs.  Yeah, he did a great job.  But you did something else, too.  Red Belt and then something else right before it.  Scorpion King 2.  That's the one.  That's the one, that first one I saw you in. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah, that was fun.  And then fucking Soul Plane was the first movie.  Yeah.  Your first movie.  No, Friday After Nick.  Right.  And it was a big-ass role, too.  Huge, yeah.  God, you've been on a fucking run.  Oh, it's crazy.  And you took the father from fucking...  Everybody Hates Chris from me.  Yeah.  I fucking...  I fucking read for that.  God damn it.  And now you're another father.  I know.  Can I have something?  But Chris Rock said you fucked it up. 
[03:14:00]  Fuck him.  Chris Rock really said that, Terry.  Fuck him, man.  Told Patrice right through his face that he fucked it up.  It was his.  We've heard a lot of Patrice almost got Rose.  Is that what happened?  Yup.  No.  Yup.  Look it, man.  It ain't even...  Look.  It was just...  I don't know what it is.  Me and Chris are both comics.  And I...  Is that kind of...  I don't know what it is, but that motherfucker...  He could have made me the uncle or something.  With all the guest stars y'all had on that fucking show.  Ricky Harris was on it.  Give me a fucking...  Can I get in there?  Oh, dude. 
[03:14:30]  Everybody.  I fucking actually know you.  Motherfuckers are like,  I know you from Battle Dome.  Right.  Shit.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm taking everything, though.  Yeah.  Dude, you are working.  When I saw the Ice Cube thing, I just went like this with the hands in there and hit my  hand.  What the fuck is Terry Crews doing?  I'm taking all they're giving right now.  And that's just...  It's a blessing, man.  It ain't...  It's a blessing for you.  No.  You hear what happens when people say it's a blessing?  Nigga, it ain't a blessing for me. 
[03:15:00]  I'm watching you like...  And it's not even...  It's just you go, wow.  You see that...  I don't know what it is.  And I think the thing that's going to make you super duper star is when you finally play...  You have to play black gangster somehow.  You have to be evil.  You've been a good guy too long now.  I did a movie last year with Gerard Butler called Gamer, where I was straight evil and  all that stuff.  But nobody saw it.  That was...  I was going to say that.  That's the only little stickler.  But like a menace to society, when you... 
[03:15:30]  The evil...  The bad guys is what always pops you off.  And I'm thinking a bad guy for you too.  But you've been bad guys.  But you've been the...  Kind of the bad guy in Scorpion King.  You were, but you...  But it was the PG-13 sword and sandal.  And they make you Randy Couture all the time too.  Like it's like they make you...  Remember how Tura Tanaka used to be?  When you see Professor Tura Tanaka and it's like he's the invincible dude that...  Right.  You got to play somebody fucking just a bad motherfucker that talks a lot. 
[03:16:00]  And you...  That kills somebody and talks a lot.  Yeah.  And then it's like fucking Terry Crews day.  Because it's still...  You're still somehow bubbling underneath.  And you just want to see that explosion where you go, that's the fucking one.  And you go, damn.  Let me tell you, I'm not in a hurry.  So that's another thing too.  I ain't trying to rush it.  Again, I got...  Everything I've got has been repeat business.  It's crazy.  Because, you know, I work with Chris Rock and Longest Yard. 
[03:16:30]  Boom.  You know, here come...  Everybody hates Chris.  Same thing with Ice Cube.  Friday after next.  Here comes, you know, Are We There Yet?  Everything is about longevity and just keeping it going.  Relationships.  Stallone plucked me out.  I was the fourth choice.  Remember that...  Listen, they went to Wesley.  But Wesley couldn't leave the country.  Then they went to, like, Forrest Whitaker.  Oh, you did this?  We were at it in Canada or something?  No, we did in Brazil.  We shot in Brazil.  You shot in Brazil?  Yeah, we shot in Brazil.  Was your wife and family there?  No.  Did you stay in a hotel all night?  Yes, I did. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah, you better have.  How about you, Andy?  I bet you went out there with your wife so she could kick a fucking...  What's her name?  Cyborg's ass?  Fucking Chris Cyborg.  That fucking...  Yeah.  Jesus.  These guys know a little bit about Brazil is what Patrice is getting at.  Yeah.  And I'm saying, did you...  They know the underbelly of Brazil.  Was your wife there with you?  I got married.  Divorced.  Since the last time you got divorced from her?  Yeah.  So you really enjoy Brazil?  You're busy, dude. 
[03:17:30]  I was there for a week of the three-week shoot in Brazil, and we were rocking the whole time.  But you've been there a million times because of training, right?  You must have been there.  That's my first time there.  You've never been to Brazil doing the whole going there with the fucking jiu-jitsu thing?  Did they know you there?  The Brazilians, did they recognize you?  Yeah, they did.  He's huge in Brazil, dude.  I mean, you know, that whole mixed martial arts is as big as the NFL over there.  And this dude is like, you know, that's LeBron James of Brazil right now.  And the main guys are getting a lot of acting work, too.  Like, Rampage is getting work, and you've done a few films. 
[03:18:00]  It's like, they're smart because they know that that's what everybody under 21 is watching  mixed martial arts.  They're going to go see you guys.  And they're legitimately tough.  They're not...  It's like...  Randy's legitimate.  You can watch him in a movie, and you just go, this feels good because you can...  You just legitimately...  Who did...  Who's the biker, the Hells Angel who knocked...  Tough fucking guy, man.  Oh, uh...  Oh, God.  Yeah, we all...  Chukito?  Chukito.  Who did he knock out or hit in the bathroom?  Uh, uh...  It was...  It was not...  John Claude Van Damme. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  Like, I think people kind of saw that as like, oh, wow, man, these guys aren't as tough,  but you guys are.  Oh.  You know what I mean?  Like, the mixed martial arts.  He ain't going to say nothing.  Well, you're not going to write.  You know what I mean?  He's not going to say shit.  He's sitting on the set and he's just smirking at you sideways.  Like, yeah, buddy.  I could kill you.  I could kill you.  Hey, what a comfort zone.  Now, I didn't ask you this before, but do you say to yourself, for real, do you say,  God damn, I can fight?  Like, is there any point where you just go, fuck, I'm...  I can beat someone's ass.  I don't think you really analyze it that way when you're in it. 
[03:19:00]  I mean, you're just doing what you do and I'm having a blast.  I enjoy the competition.  I enjoy the training.  It's kind of like...  How about to a square, though?  Like, to a square guy who's not in a...  Meaning, if somebody who's not in the UFC and they bump into you and you just go, wow.  Like, if it was a regular dude, regular muscles, just tough guy.  And I always say it's like, you can't beat a dude that knows how to fight.  Like, you can be tough, but it's like, wow, you can look at a guy and go, wow, he's standing  in a way where I can break his leg or something. 
[03:19:30]  And do you...  Would you question him, like, would you say to him, look, man, look, I know how to fight.  You're going to get hurt.  Don't get hurt.  Like, are you...  Do you have to let a person who's a square in the street know that you are legitimately  dangerous?  Do you have to let them know?  I've never found myself in that situation.  I don't know.  I mean...  But my hands are registered weapons.  Is that true? 
[03:20:00]  Is that fucking true?  He has a piece of paper in his pocket right now.  Yeah, I think that's a lot.  A fucking pamphlet.  If shit goes down and you end up in a court of law, you've got not a leg to stand on.  Right.  With my background.  Yeah, I would just have...  So it is like a thing where...  If your life had better been threatened or whoever you're with has better...  Just have YouTube videos on your phone and show the guy that wants to fight you and go,  look, this is me, asshole.  Watch him choke the life out of some asshole. 
[03:20:30]  I know those are uncomfortable questions, but really tough dudes.  You know, they got this thing called no homo.  You go, no homo, but it's like really tough dudes.  We used to have a question, we grew up and go, okay, how much anger do you need to have been able to fight Mike Tyson?  And it's like, you know, you go levels, smack your mother anger.  Like if Tyson smacked your mama, do you think you can muster enough anger to, you know what I mean, to fight him? 
[03:21:00]  So it's like you just, tough dudes, and when you say tough, legitimately hate for fun, you know?  That's why the questions, man, I know it's like kind of uncomfortable, but it's like motherfuckers that fight for real are like superheroes, man.  Most of the guys I know that find themselves in that situation, when you're in a bar or whatever and a guy makes the offense,  you ain't so big, I think I could take you, they're going to smile, they're going to laugh that shit off.  They're not, you know, they got nothing to prove, and they're not going to take that step to that guy. 
[03:21:30]  Right.  Say what?  Right.  They're just going to let that go.  See, I'm the friend that you don't want to have with you because I go, no, you can't.  I'm smacking your bitch face.  You really would be like the big mouth girl and shit.  I really am.  I'm a chick.  I'm an ugly chick.  My best friend can beat up your best friend.  We throw the first punch.  Let me go, Randy.  Get off me.  Get off me, Randy.  Yeah, let me go.  Let me ask you a question because they're saying we have to wrap up.  When BJ Penn was in here, he put me in an arm bar for a second. 
[03:22:00]  I could have probably went a little bit, but I tapped just to.  But what kind of a move could you put me in?  Not to hurt me, but to show me.  I want to see what something feels like that I've never.  Have you been choked?  No, don't choke.  Yeah, go for the choke.  I'm going to tell you what's going to happen.  I mean, you're not going to be able to choke him out because his neck.  You ever see.  You're not going to be able to find his neck.  He's got two carotid out of his neck.  You can choke him out.  No, his neck will press against the back of his spine. 
[03:22:30]  Could you show me how that's done?  But then I will tap very quickly.  I won't choke you out.  Okay, thanks.  But I'll definitely.  And by the way, James Toney, are you going to out to fuck him up?  Are you going to teach him a lesson or is it just regular, regular?  It's a fight.  You've got to take it seriously.  I mean, the guy's a world champion boxer.  He must be shit talking.  I haven't seen any promos yet.  Is he talking shit?  Oh, he's good at talking shit.  If you start losing the fight, just say fuck the fight. 
[03:23:00]  Just attack him and break his leg and take the loss out of technicality.  Are you shooting right away?  I don't know if you've given away a plan, but he must be shooting right away.  Yeah, there's no secret there.  This is a mixed martial arts competition.  Okay.  He's taking him down.  Take the boxer.  Oh, it's mixed martial arts.  You're not just boxing.  No, no.  Okay.  Now, you remember I like you a lot, right?  You know that.  Ray Mercer made that shit stop with Tim Silver.  That is no more of that shit.  And that was supposed to be a boxing match, and they wouldn't sanction it,  so they had to do an MMA match. 
[03:23:30]  And there was supposed to be a gentleman's agreement that he wasn't going to kick.  Like, the first thing Tim did was walked out and kicked Ray.  And Ray's like, oh, yeah?  And dropped him like a bad habit.  Wow.  Don't get knocked out by James Donnie, please.  Oh, thanks for the mojo there.  I'm just saying.  It's a weird day.  Fucking fatal loss.  Kind of weird.  You just don't want to.  It's just kind of a weird day.  Just some...  I'm taking it very seriously.  He's going to be dangerous, especially early in the fight. 
[03:24:00]  He's an explosive, very good striker.  And, you know, I've got to do my best to make sure he doesn't land one.  Wow.  All right.  Now, choke Jimmy.  Choke Jimmy.  Well, let's phrase this properly.  We're just demonstrating on how a move would be done.  You ever choke a clam?  Use that technique.  Ready to talk.  Now, what's the proper way to...  Hold on.  Physiologically, the carotid arteries are right here.  Oh, fuck.  There's two kinds of choke.  There's a blood choke, which is you're cutting off the blood supply.  There's a wind choke.  Wind chokes are actually very painful. 
[03:24:30]  You don't want it again.  Okay.  Crushes his trachea and some crazy shit.  Eventually, he'll pass out because there's no oxygen, but it's a much slower way.  It's a death blow.  You know how humiliating it is?  He's controlling me with his finger right now.  You know why?  He's checking to see if you're done.  Oh, God.  What was the bicep on one carotid and my forearm on the other?  Oh, God.  And now, if I apply it...  Wow.  That was it?  That was it right there?  Wow.  You made a sound? 
[03:25:00]  He peed.  He didn't hurt me.  There's pee on his leg.  How do you fucking get these guys who fight for...  He made a sound like...  When Fado got choked, he fought a long time.  And he used to choke with his legs.  Triangle choke is a blood choke.  He applied the pressure...  Wow.  That's effective.  Can you do that again?  You can't...  You can't...  Don't start jerking off.  No, no, I'm not.  No.  Here comes the poop.  You can't...  Done.  Wow.  You can't...  There's nothing you're going to do to get out of that.  Nope.  If you're me.  Wow.  That's fucking great.  Holy shit.  So, if a guy has you like that, what's... 
[03:25:30]  You've got the same carotid artery...  My chin down.  But you still can fight it.  Yeah, because he's giving me his neck and letting me put it on.  But is that what you guys are avoiding?  That's the end game right there.  Once he gets it sunk in that deep.  In real competition, in real time, I'm going to fight and keep him out of getting it that deep.  So that's what Jimmy can't do is put his chin down.  He needs one.  Immediately.  If it's sunk, it's over.  And so, when Brock got Carwin, what was being crushed there? 
[03:26:00]  His carotid artery?  Oh, good.  So he had a bicep on one and his own shoulder on the other.  Oh, his own shoulder was choking.  Okay, okay.  And if you don't really like a motherfucker, you go for the fucking one at the trachea.  That's...  I don't like you very much.  Damn.  That's your not breathing.  And you never really see that.  You don't see it because it's guys like each other, basically.  Do you know how embarrassing that would be if my girlfriend saw me?  That would happen, like, in a bar if I shit-talked you and you did that in front of my chick?  How fucking humiliating that would be. 
[03:26:30]  In a split second, you're just like, oh, wow.  You're fucking wow.  Oh, she's a whore.  I'm sorry.  Wow.  So, Jimmy, were you just like...  I'm an actor.  Did you realize...  I need more makeup.  Terry's like, eh, don't...  My makeup, please.  We have to get it out?  Thank you.  I just want to know if, Norton, did you know you were, like, you would pass out?  It was a weird feeling.  It was almost like instinct kicks in, and my hand...  There's nothing I could have done to stop my hand from going, tap.  Nothing. 
[03:27:00]  Nothing.  I know at that moment, like, there's...  Because I can't fight, but there's nothing you can do.  Yes.  Again, there's nothing...  Because he's a lot stronger than me, obviously.  But once you're in that pit, there's nothing.  By the way, there was a girl on YouTube that lasted about 10 seconds longer than you did.  She actually...  Hey, she actually wouldn't tap, you fucking sissy.  She said, I'm going to take it like a goddamn man, you fucking worm.  Hey, you know what?  He just...  All he did was place his thumb knuckle, and Norton's like, oh, I feel it. 
[03:27:30]  Fuck you.  Salmon neck motherfucker.  Took it.  Yeah, but she didn't have Randy Couture doing it.  Fuck her.  She did have Randy.  It was her.  Did she?  Yeah, bitch.  That's what I just said.  She was taking it easy on her.  She wanted to be choked out.  No, she choked out.  She went out.  So, Jimmy, why don't you try to last 10 seconds?  She wanted to go to sleep.  Oh, I don't want to go to sleep.  No.  Some women like submission.  Exactly.  Some women like submission.  Exactly.  Got real men don't like submitting. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah, real men tap and go...  You tap out.  We got to get them out of here.  They're freaking out.  Real men do this right away.  All right, we'll take a break.  We got to wrap up.  Well, we got to get the plug out.  Thank you, guys.  In theaters, August 13th.  Terry Crews and, of course, Randy Couture.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you.  Thanks for having us on.  Sit pretty still and listen.  Yeah.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show on the Virus Sirius XM.  It had to be.  They're not going to talk about it, though. 
[03:28:30]  Pretty good show today.  I want to thank Patrice O'Neal for sitting in.  Oh, hell yeah.  I want to thank Jimmy for coming back from Montreal to do about an hour of radio today.  Of course.  On his birthday.  Yes.  Yes.  Happy birthday.  Thank you.  What's going on here?  Show's ending?  A little bit.  We're getting close to wrapping up.  15 minutes.  I don't want to go.  Terry Crews.  He's a good guy.  He's a very nice guy.  Lonely.  Real good guy.  You're lonely?  I don't feel like going.  Why don't you leave?  Why don't you come back?  Jimmy's out a lot.  Yeah, I'm doing Leno Wednesday. 
[03:29:00]  Are you in tomorrow?  Yes.  In tomorrow, out Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Don't do Wednesday.  I might do Comic Con or I might cancel.  You don't want to do Wednesday?  I'm leaving.  Where are you going, baby?  You're not.  I'm going to Miami.  This weekend.  When do you leave?  Wednesday.  So I can do early morning radio in Miami.  On Thursday.  Doing the improv.  I don't drop a shit in the improv.  White acts don't do that well there.  It's a very black Spanish market.  I do good in Fort Lauderdale.  But Miami, I do.  Stop fucking marginalizing the fucking club because you don't do well.  I'm saying you'll do well there. 
[03:29:30]  Why do you make it racial?  Because I'm saying it's...  Shit.  Everyone who knows anything.  Why does it have a black audience?  No, no.  But it's not even insulting.  It's just in Miami, it's not typically...  Most white acts don't do that well there because it's mostly a Latinx.  Latino and black market.  That's not an insult.  No, it's true.  Norton, you know what?  As a black...  I love Norton.  Yes, you do.  But...  As a black man...  There's a butt in there.  Yeah, there's a butt.  As a black person that doesn't know Norton, he has the face where you are not allowed  to really enjoy him as a black person. 
[03:30:00]  Right.  No regular black person would go...  You're right.  To enjoy that face.  That's why I don't do black audiences.  You're right.  That's exactly why.  Just because of his face?  He's right.  He has a face.  What could he do to fix that?  Nothing.  I mean...  His chin...  His chin just for his own fucking own aesthetics, but it's nothing he can really do to...  Blacks don't like chinless faces?  He's just such a little white boy.  Yeah.  And that's all it is?  It's racial.  Isn't it funny funny?  Huh?  Shouldn't it funny be funny? 
[03:30:30]  Fucking...  I go to Minnesota and offend the three people that come see me.  Minnesota, you don't do well in them.  If I say anything that's just not about Minnesota, and even if it was about Minnesota, I'm 300  some odd pounds of black guy who ain't happy.  If I smile, I might get over, but it's just not a happy thing.  So again, I don't know, but it might be racial, but in the middle of the country, it's just...  Yeah, they're just looking at you like, motherfucker.  Yeah, like... 
[03:31:00]  Goddamn, I told you.  If I get a little arrogant or a little...  If I fuck with some white woman, it's like uppity nigger shit.  Richie Marilyn, if you're lonely, go stick around and do Ron and Fez today.  There you go.  I don't know.  You're looking at me weird.  I don't know.  I don't know what to say.  I didn't say...  Why is weird just looking at you?  It was a weird look.  You're not going to set me up.  You would do...  It wasn't even a setup, to be honest.  I didn't look at you weird.  You would do good radio with Ronnie.  I think Ron should be talked about as one of the best radio people ever in history. 
[03:31:30]  He's fantastic.  Ever.  I've never been invited.  Yeah, I never...  I mean, that's why I don't go.  You feel self-conscious.  You don't just walk in.  I've never been invited to do a show.  I don't know how he is, though.  You just walk in and then...  I don't know...  Ronnie's the type of guy that will drop everything if one of you guys walked in the door.  He wouldn't give a shit.  If I heard that from him, I don't fucking know what he's doing.  I don't know.  That's how he does it.  If all of a sudden he sees you, he would drop everything and hang out with you for an hour.  Easy.  I think he...  He interviewed me for something I did on XM.  What?  The Unmasked? 
[03:32:00]  Yeah.  I think he...  I think he...  To be one of the great radio people ever, just in terms of his knowledge, he's great.  I think he's great.  Unmasked should be on TV?  It should be.  Easily.  Yeah.  But it's, again, I think he's too...  Easily.  Like we were talking about, you would hope there's a market for people who just kind of...  That's a no-brainer thing, though.  Kind of tell it.  I don't know why that's not on TV.  Someone should pick that up in a second.  But he should be on TV.  Everybody should be. 
[03:32:30]  You should be on TV.  Everyone should just be on TV.  Everyone here that comes through, I would think.  We don't want to play with their fucking rules.  But you hear what Terry said, though.  And I don't disagree, man.  He plays the game a little bit, right?  People like him, man.  And that's not a knock.  It's just like, fuck.  I wish I had to learn how to be likable to everybody.  You need likability.  We didn't even talk about the Old Spice commercials with Terry Crews.  That's the big one right now.  With the abdominals.  They're fucking...  Those things are viral.  As viral as you could get, those damn things. 
[03:33:00]  And he probably is making most of his money from that.  You think?  You think?  You're passionate like that?  Fuck yeah.  Probably.  All the money he's making, he's probably...  Where he's at in this game, on TBS, you probably have to take a little lower on this show on TBS.  And everybody hates Chris.  I bet you on everybody hates Chris, he was the star of the show.  But he wasn't a big name.  I bet you he makes a very non-aggressive five figures in around the 20s, an episode, I would think. 
[03:33:30]  Oh, I see what you're saying.  About 20s.  High to low.  And then on this one, since it's TBS, but he still has a big name, I bet you he makes a non-aggressive five.  About 30.  How much is he worth?  I bet you he makes 35.  How much is he worth right now?  He probably has about three in the bank, I bet you.  Three Gs?  No.  About three Gs.  Yeah, a bunch of iPhones.  You know?  And he's a family man, and he had a show on BET with his wife, and she kind of got it together a little bit. 
[03:34:00]  I don't know if he's a family man.  I think he's just scared to leave his wife.  Why?  He says she's from Gary, Indiana, and she would cut you.  So he's probably just scared to leave.  He's only saying that shit to say it.  He's not leaving.  He loves him.  He's been with him a long time.  And she's been with him in the lean years.  They've been together forever.  So it's like you have to be a little, you know, you have to be loyal, man.  You have to be loyal.  A girl has been around during the fucking shit. 
[03:34:30]  Then when you pop.  And he popped.  He's popping.  He's popping.  He's more than popping.  Well, he's still, look it.  He's bubbling still?  A lot of white people.  You ain't popped until white people know your name.  And I bet you the thing that most white people know is the old Spice commercial.  Of course.  Oh, he's the old, oh, with the muscles coming?  Of course.  But it's like black people, he's pretty much a household name in black world.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  He's big in black world.  In white world, he's probably still, he's the fucking. 
[03:35:00]  He's got to catch on name-wise.  Yeah.  Who's the white equivalent to Terry Crews?  Maybe a tough question.  That's known in the white world and not as much in the black world.  That's a fucking, that's a, that's a, yeah, that's a, but I'm saying who, who should be?  Gary Oldman, I bet you, to the average black person that might watch Friday, you go, Gary Oldman, you go, who that?  Oh, you know the motherfucker played Commissioner Gordon?  Oh, that motherfucker.  He's, but if you're a fan of movies, you know him from professional, you know, there's, there's certain people that, you know, that should know. 
[03:35:30]  You know, he's, you know what I mean?  Gary Oldman is probably not known by as many black people as you should be because he's so white.  He's, you know, he's so white.  He was in JFK, played Oswald.  He's a genius.  Did he?  Yes, he was Oswald in JFK.  I didn't know about that.  I didn't know he was British until I heard him interview.  Like Brad Pitt is famous and Denzel Washington's famous.  Anybody?  Across the board.  Across the board.  Everybody knows that.  All right.  What else we got?  Oh, well, E-Rock's got the, the noise you made when you got choked out. 
[03:36:00]  Oh, yeah.  Just for the radio.  It didn't.  Oh, it's good enough.  I want to hear that.  Here it is.  E-Rock's panicking.  Are you panicking?  Is that a look of panic?  I think so.  E-Rock's head's getting bigger and his face is getting smaller.  Fucking guy's starting to look like a.  All right.  It's like he's being blown up on a bicycle pump from the back.  What a great visual.  You see those guys.  Their head gets bigger, but their face gets smaller.  His features are disappearing. 
[03:36:30]  He's just like one of those things where you put a big one in a little one and then a little one in another little one.  He's a fucking, a Russian, fucking balloon face.  His head is turning into a black hole.  It's collapsing on itself.  He really makes me sick.  That's E-Rock.  Oh, boy.  I'm getting fed up with E-Rock.  I say hello to him every morning.  I'm just looking out and struggling.  But E-Rock's lucky.  I don't think anyone will Photoshop you on those little Russian fucking.  You don't have that Tori body rock. 
[03:37:00]  Don't worry about it.  Stackable Russian.  And the other thing.  I love the other thing.  I'm just saying.  And I noticed it because he's just sitting in as he's under pressure to do something.  Yeah, he's freaking out.  And his little baby features are just.  Someone's saying it's not Terry Crews in the new ads.  What, they changed the old Spice guys?  There's two different ad campaigns.  Yes.  All right.  And there's two different black guys.  One is Terry Crews and one is this other guy.  Oh, okay.  The one on the horse.  You know, you look at me.  Look at him.  Look at me.  Look at him. 
[03:37:30]  And Terry Crews is like, ah!  Two naked niggas.  And it's like, that's why I asked that question.  I hope I didn't ask him that question like fucked up.  But it's like black people do have that.  Yeah, yeah.  They get out.  You know, just a big, strong, naked Negro screaming.  And it's just like, you know, he said it.  He said, fuck it, man.  Fuck that.  Fuck it.  And I mean, I like to hear that.  This one does, dummy.  It's super powerful.  Odor blocker body wash.  Oh!  B-b-b-b-b-b-b-power!  That's Terry Crews. 
[03:38:00]  Odor blocker body wash.  That's 16 hours of video blocking power!  That's right.  By the way, these commercials should be called White Man's Worst Nightmare.  Yeah.  A nigga that smells good.  Ryan the Tiger with that body and screaming.  That's right.  Sure smells good in here. 
[03:38:30]  That's because this blocks me up!  Sorry.  Sorry about that.  Who figured out this would work?  B-b-b-b-b-power!  Who the fuck figured out that would work?  I see these spots a lot during Adult Swim, so that should probably give you an idea.  The potheads.  Just screaming with muscles coming out of his muscles.  And he's making a zillion dollars. 
[03:39:00]  Even if I was a nice guy, I couldn't get that commercial.  You'd have to be in complete shape.  I think he's close to 40.  What is Marc Maron doing here?  Oh, me and Marc are going to talk.  You don't like us anymore?  Come in and say hi.  You don't want to.  What happened?  Everything good?  Nah, me and Marc.  What the fuck?  Are Marc Maron going to come and discuss something with me and he's mad?  They was like, oh, Jesus, Marc.  You don't like us anymore?  Marc is out of the business.  He's dressed like he lives on a beach that one of his friends owns. 
[03:39:30]  He looks like he's a member of the Sierra Club.  Oh, he's just.  Maron just said, fuck the business.  Please, God help me.  I don't want to quit yet.  Oh, my God.  Who's talking?  I just got here.  Andy Dufresne sanding a boat.  All right.  Okay.  Hey, it's great seeing you guys.  He's out already.  Jesus.  What do you want from me?  It's hot outside.  You look healthy, though.  You look fucking unbelievably good.  You turn that all around.  You turn that all around with that. 
[03:40:00]  You look great, man.  Thank you very much.  It's the stress of you being happy and you look fucking fantastic.  That's exactly it, man.  You know it's great, though.  I'm not funny at all anymore.  That's what the fuck?  You know, yeah, it's horrible.  Yeah, I feel great, Patrice, but I cannot say a fucking funny thing to save my life.  I am on the way to that, and I don't have nothing.  Yeah.  I have nothing.  I felt that right away.  But it's.  See how that bomb?  You are done. 
[03:40:30]  You don't even know sarcasm anymore.  Nothing.  I get nothing.  Fuck.  Are you happy, dude?  What?  Have you really felt that way?  I've had those moments, a lot of them, where you're just like, I stink.  For real.  Well, what happened to me, like, I quit.  I got off the nicotine, finally.  I was doing the lozenges, the gum, all that shit.  So I'm on nothing.  So I get up there.  I'm not aggravated.  I'm not mad.  It's just pure fear, and I want to leave.  And there's that moment where you're like, holy shit, they can see it.  It's fucking over.  And then I got to get angry at somebody in the audience, and I rejigger it, and everything's  all right. 
[03:41:00]  But that's what it comes down to.  Looking good, man.  Thank you, man.  Are you going to talk to me after the show?  Yeah, we can do it.  Mark has a very popular podcast.  It's doing very well, man.  Fucking making very exposing people for the horse shit they are doing.  A little bit.  I'm ready for it.  Expose me, because I'm ready to quit.  There's nothing to expose with you.  Expose me.  Just make everybody, the fucking two people that know me, just say he's a fraud.  The two that believe in me.  My mother.  You want the last two?  My dog, it's just fucking done. 
[03:41:30]  Right.  Fucking done.  Is that why you're here, Mark?  We would have had you on the show today.  I just got here today.  I told Steve that I'm around all week.  All right, then we'll have Mark on the show later this week.  Yeah, it'd be great to not be funny here.  I agree.  I can't believe how fucking delicious Mark looks.  Jesus.  Oh, this is good.  Your calves are very muscular.  I noticed your calves when you're running or something.  Oh, he's fucking looking good, man.  Well, I started dating a lunatic, and she's a vegetarian.  Are you the same person we talked about last time?  No.  No, it was very difficult to get rid of the dominatrix, but I did. 
[03:42:00]  Oh, that's right.  It was hard to do because they don't like being told what to do.  You just won't get that San Francisco bullshit out of the system.  I want to hear about the lunatic.  She's 27.  She's a vegetarian.  She's completely out of her mind.  She lives in what looks to be a nest of some kind.  A lot of clothing on the floor.  Every day you go over to her house, it's like,  how can everything you fucking own be on the floor in mourning?  In mourning.  And then she's kind of draining.  Here's the kind of girl she is.  She said to me, because I left for the road, 
[03:42:30]  and we had a mature discussion about trust.  She said, I just want to tell you, if you fuck anybody on the road,  I'm going to fuck people you know.  See you.  Have a good time.  Drop my name.  So I think it's love.  I'm very excited about it.  Fuck people you know.  Just the general fuck people you know.  No one specific.  Wow.  They could be friends.  They could be enemies.  She's hot too, isn't she?  She's really cute, man.  Wow.  Now, did you get her on Marc Maronis,  or a fucking dude with a mustache, glasses? 
[03:43:00]  How are you?  It's a mixture.  It's a mixture.  I got her on, I think, Marc Maronis.  She sent me an email through my website saying,  look, I'm not going to have this body forever.  I need to fuck somebody a lot,  and I want it to be you.  So I said, of course.  And we met in Portland, and we spent the weekend.  And you gave her some nice fucking hard alternative dick,  you motherfucker.  I did.  I gave her some powerful nerd cops.  You say, take this, Jake Johansson.  That's exactly what I did.  Give her a little Jake Johansson and a dash of Oswald.  I said that twice.  Yeah.  I said that.  A week later, she moved to L.A. 
[03:43:30]  That was a little creepy.  Wow.  A week later, she's like, I'm here.  I moved here.  And she goes, but not for you.  But not for you.  And then it was one of those things.  Here's what happened.  She texted me like 49 times.  I told her, you're a fucking stalker.  Leave me alone.  I've had it.  And she said, why don't you fuck me?  Why don't you fuck me?  Over and over again.  Like 40 times to one text.  Like, if I held it up to you, and you wanted to say,  this is what crazy looks like.  Then like the 50th text was a picture of her pussy.  So I was like, I got to rethink this.  And yeah, but here's the true story. 
[03:44:00]  Two texts later, the guy who was building my bookshelf  sent me a text of the bookshelf he was building.  I was more excited about that.  I thought to myself, you know, this is something  I'll have to be afraid to put my, you know,  something into.  So I, and it might last.  So I got the bookshelf and the chick now.  And I, and she's coming out here tonight.  I'm a little, I don't know.  How long have you been a sinner?  Because I remember you telling me about it.  A few months.  It's been a, it's, I always touch with that shit,  but it's been a few months.  And it's really good.  And it's really fucking crazy.  And I, and I thought all that anger and weirdness in me  was gone, but it's all right there. 
[03:44:30]  Apparently that's how I court.  That's how I, I yell at a girl until she cries a few times.  And if she can take it, we're in, we're going to go for a while.  You look better than you did in your 95 HBO special.  Holy shit.  Are we going to fuck after this?  I just can't believe.  Because here's my fear.  He looks so much healthier now than, than when he,  if you say he's on top of his game comedically or whatever,  he looks, it's, it's like, I'm sitting here going,  am I going to Mark Maron myself and, and, and feel and look better, 
[03:45:00]  but, but be traveling around doing a fucking podcast,  which is what we don't want to be doing, but it's, he's happy.  Happiness.  The world is getting into a shitty joke.  You were starting to an insult on me.  No, no, it's, I'm being very sincere.  He's ahead of all of us.  That's the, the world is going toward the podcast.  I'm telling you, he's a, he's, he's the leader right now.  But it's, but it's the fight,  the early fight of trying to get to this place where we think we want to be. 
[03:45:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then you're realizing you're never going to get there and you better settle for  something.  And you better fucking be happy.  No bullshit.  I know it sounds insulting, but I'm just being trying to be honest about it.  Realizing your limitations is a grownup moment.  Well, look, we'll get Mark in tomorrow or the next day.  We'll figure it out.  Great.  Uh, the podcast, where can they hear it?  WTFpod.com.  I think, uh, what's up there today.  There's some good ones up there.  I did.  Dane, your buddy Dane came on and I was an asshole to him.  I didn't, but why did you think you had to be?  I didn't, what else am I going to do?  Why are you being a fucking, what else am I going to do? 
[03:46:00]  Why are you being the fucking, the, the, the, the modder or the, the nemesis to Dane  for these fucking young douchebags, these douchebags who want to be Dane?  I wasn't the nemesis.  I just didn't know it.  You want to attack Dane because you have to talk to him.  I'm telling you, I'm not mad at Dane.  You know why a lot of, I'm not mad at him because I fucking know him.  Yeah.  And I talked to him and I know that motherfucker, what he's doing is honest.  He does not want to do fucking pain comedy that digs deep.  He don't. 
[03:46:30]  Right.  He's not deep and he's not interesting.  I agree.  Oh, see.  He's deep.  He's deep.  Wow.  Mark DeMarin around.  Come on, Mark, man.  Damn, Mark.  Don't do that, man.  Honestly, it's like Dane is just a go-to name, but he's a funnier, honestly, he's a funnier.  I have nothing to gain from Dane.  He's a funnier guy than people give, than comedians give him credit for.  I have absolutely nothing against him.  I didn't go into it with any, I didn't vilify him.  I don't care about the stealing thing.  I don't care about, you know, what people think he's a hack or whatever.  You really are a slick white guy. 
[03:47:00]  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  Listen to me, Patrice.  This is very good, man.  All I'm saying is that when I just thought that he had a lot of charisma, not a lot of  depth.  And when I listened to him, I thought like, well, I guess people like it.  He's filling arenas, but I'm not that interested.  But he wanted to come on and I was going to talk to him and I was a little defensive.  I just quit nicotine that day.  And also, I just didn't, I felt like he was just giving me patter.  You know, I want to have a conversation.  But you know what?  Only people who are finished in the business give you the interview that you're looking 
[03:47:30]  for.  That you're hoping for.  Yeah.  Dane can't give you a fucking.  We see that a lot.  Patrice is making a pretty good point.  Can't say anything.  The guys that have a lot to lose don't give up much stuff on this show.  They're like politicians.  Yeah, Dane got too many people who don't understand truth that's fans of his.  He can't go out there and say fucked up shit.  He can't.  Yeah.  Patrice makes a good point.  We've seen a lot on this show.  We really do.  Yeah, I think that's what frustrated me.  Is that like, I felt like I was getting stock stuff and I wanted him to cry and I just couldn't 
[03:48:00]  make him cry.  You might have got more out of him if he knew you better too.  Sometimes people are much more likely to open up if they know a guy.  Like they feel like.  And if I wasn't a dick, I was kind of a dick.  And quite frankly, you are, I will say, as we're, you know, Mark Maron, we all talk  and there's a lot of guys who spawn a lot of comedy children where you say these guys  are stealing from this guy, stealing his essence.  Attell has that.  Maron has in the top, probably in the top five. 
[03:48:30]  A lot of Mark Maron's out there?  All-time children.  A lot of children.  Really?  You think so?  Maron has a lot of famous children too.  Oh.  Can you write one down?  Hey, really, help me out.  Or do you want to just fucking say it?  You're pretty honest.  I'll say it.  The name that, and this is the streets.  All right.  Mark, you don't have to acknowledge that you can even hear this.  This is the streets.  Right.  Patton is a Mark Maron baby.  Mm.  Well, there is a time.  That's the streets.  Yeah.  That's the streets.  Okay?  I love Patton. 
[03:49:00]  Let me say that.  I love Patton.  Patton never speaks bad, but I'm talking about the streets talking.  What they're saying.  Is Colin Quinn has a lot of babies out there.  Who's the number one that has the most babies?  Dave Attell.  Oh, Attell.  Dave Attell.  Attell.  He is.  Okay.  He has the most children walking around.  Attell, Todd, and Hedberg.  This day.  What?  Attell, Todd, and Hedberg.  Which is the.  Which.  Todd Berry and Hedberg.  Todd Berry has.  But not on Attell's level.  Hedberg a lot.  Hedberg a lot.  A lot.  Yeah.  I know that.  Attell a lot.  And the question. 
[03:49:30]  And it might be.  I don't know.  I don't know Attell.  But posthumously.  Oh, yeah.  People in the streets say that Hedberg is a Attell baby.  Really?  Yeah.  You slow it down a little bit.  And yeah.  No, it's possible.  His thinking was so different than Attell's.  It was more of a Stephen Wright thing.  Yeah.  His thinking was so.  Where he went for a joke.  Attell.  Really laid back company, man.  Like he was so fucking beatnik kind of and different than Attell.  Attell is a.  It's a pacing.  Guys deal like.  Da-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba. 
[03:50:00]  And his.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  And his out there-ness with that.  Yeah.  But Maren.  Maren is.  I didn't know Maren had a lot of children out there.  Maren might be.  A lot of babies.  No.  I'm hoping they're having a better time with it than I am.  Oh, they are.  Because they take a little bit of the actual you and make it more accessible to these fucking people.  So they just give a little bit, and it's like, wow, he's crazy, but he's not crazy.  He's not going to hurt us.  How did you end the interview?  It went okay. 
[03:50:30]  He ended up really wanting me to like him, and he ended up inviting me to his house for Fourth of July and sending me a present.  I felt kind of bad.  He's not a bad guy, dude.  He gets a bad rap from comics because he's right.  In a way, comedians think we're supposed to feel a certain way, and I guess I know him before he hit.  I didn't feel that.  But he's actually a nice dude.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Can I ask you guys, because how much of that is jealousy?  A whole lot.  And I'm not saying you three in the room in particular, but the whole fucking comedy world. 
[03:51:00]  It depends on what people's issue is.  How many people fucking beat them up because they're actually just jealous?  There's 100 people, jealousy, look, because you've got to go, guys who are really upset, who want to say something, who thinks comedy is about saying something, out of 100, it's 10 of them.  The rest, 90% is jealous.  Just motherfuckers seeing that he's feeling the reason.  That's what you guys are saying.  You know, Mark is saying it.  I only get jealous of people that are like me.  I don't get jealous of people that I've got nothing to do with.  I mean, I never understood the contempt against him because it just didn't register. 
[03:51:30]  That really wasn't a shot at any of you guys.  I'm just talking in general.  I'm jealous.  I'm jealous.  I'm jealous of him.  And you know what the contempt is?  The contempt is, Dane made it on this perception of a plan that everybody thinks was like, that's the contingency plan, which is like, I'm going to be famous by doing YouTube, Facebook, MySpace.  And it did not happen that way.  So it becomes, oh, he's only doing, he probably licked somebody's ass. 
[03:52:00]  So it's like these guys who emulate and want to be famous, that blueprint of fame, they follow the blueprint and then they realize, oh, shit.  Dude, he hit the social network.  There is no blueprint.  Yes, he did.  Really early.  It's not easy to do what Dane did because he got in real early.  Russell Peters is the only guy, the other guy that did it that way.  Early.  But to hold on to it.  I mean, the thing is, it's like anyone can do that.  But to actually maintain a career after you do that, I mean, that's the trick.  I mean, you get these guys in Last Comic Standing or whatever. 
[03:52:30]  They're good for a year.  But I mean, to maintain a following and to maintain a business, I mean, that's the trick.  And you can't manufacture lightning in a bottle.  There's no blueprint.  I mean, fuck, who the hell knows who's going to hit him for what reason?  Now, you're not a big fan of his, but what do you respect about him?  What do I respect about him?  Did I say I did?  If anything.  No, if anything.  That's how you know he's bad.  He repeated your question because he's like, oh boy, am I going to say something?  He got Mel Gibson.  What?  I'm turning the podcast on Mark Merritt. 
[03:53:00]  I know.  Is there anything you respect about him?  I respect his discipline.  If anything, you've got to respect a guy's work ethic.  I find that most guys who get real famous and hold on to a career, they work their asses off.  And as a guy who doesn't necessarily work his ass off, after I've talked to a lot of these cats who have money and who have fame,  the one thing they do is they work fucking hard.  Hard workers.  And so if there's anything I can respect, it's that because I certainly don't have that.  Good answer, man.  You answered it.  Fuck.  You're going to say fuck that.  That's very fair. 
[03:53:30]  All right.  Well, Mark Merritt is going to come in tomorrow, Wednesday.  Patrice, you're off to Miami, the Miami Improv this weekend.  I thought we'd see you another day.  We got no Jimmy all week.  I would just love to.  Unless you want to just come in tomorrow.  I don't get fucked.  I'm lonely, man.  Just hang out.  Come in tomorrow.  Hang with your friends.  Come in tomorrow.  Look, I might need you guys.  I don't want to fucking wear out my wedding.  All right.  We'll figure it out.  You don't want to be obligated.  I don't want to wear out my wedding.  You don't care about what I want.  You don't want to be obligated to communicate your time.  But you should come in.  Your friends miss you.  I don't get to do radio with you much. 
[03:54:00]  Yeah.  Come in tomorrow.  I like coming in.  I like laughing.  All right.  We'll have fun.  Look, we'll figure it all out.  Jimmy, you good?  I'm great, man.  No, I mean, any plugs?  No, no, no.  Thank you.  I'm fine, buddy.  It's his birthday today.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  How old are you?  42.  Really?  It happened, huh?  Your dick's still getting raging hard, brother?  But it's Cialis.  It does.  They took my fucking pill cutter in the airport today in Canada.  I had a fucking nice Cialis I was going to pop yesterday for my girlfriend today.  Did you check your heart?  Did you check your heart for that shit?  You checking your heart?  I don't know.  I've had some problems, but who knows?  See how fast you lost air with this fucking guy touching neck, man? 
[03:54:30]  You got to check your heart with that shit.  It takes blood and puts it in your dick, man.  Thank you.  I'm just saying.  What's used to living if your dick is not good?  But doesn't the blood go back up to your heart when you're done?  Dude, there's a warning if your dick stays hard for four hours.  And you're taking a half a pill.  How hard does your dick get without the pill?  Yeah, you know, it's all right.  Mine's fill up, but it's still there's soft spots.  It doesn't...  It was raging the other day.  I punched my girl in the back of the head. 
[03:55:00]  I woke up, my dick was raging hard for the first time in a long time.  Is it like an old fucking elbow to get up, bitch?  Come on, let's go now.  Is it like an old bike tire?  Dude, it's just...  It's a medium rare sausage.  There's smushy spots.  It's a mess, and I can't take Viagra.  And if my girl fucks somebody else, I can't be that mad at her.  It's like a neck with calcium deposits in it.  There's just really good choice spots.  Just bulb veins. 
[03:55:30]  Why can't you take a Viagra?  My heart.  He's got some shit, man.  But that can't...  Dude, it's a fucking...  It does things to your heart.  It opens your vessels.  It dilates all your vessels.  It gets more blood to you, right?  I think so.  He's just trying to figure it all out.  I think Dr. Norton has spoken.  I think he's right, though.  Athletes are using it for endurance now.  Not even to fuck, but to run.  Like, they'll take them before they run to open up.  You can't use that as a...  Those fuckers will do anything.  Did you see Bigger Better?  They'll do anything to exist.  You're right. 
[03:56:00]  Well, they've got to strap their fucking cocks down.  Yeah.  That's how they're running with a fucking heart on.  They want to get somewhere and jack off.  They do it like a dog race.  They put a chick in front of them, and they do it.  Anthony, you still getting raging hard without drugs?  Yeah.  It's still getting ridiculous.  It's raging?  Yeah, I'm not even going to fucking, like, say, like, well, yeah, I'm doing it.  It gets raging.  Ant's dick is soft, but the head is really hard.  And he throws it in like an old Bible weapon. 
[03:56:30]  He just fucking swings it.  Throws it in the pussy.  Like the shit they use to catch ostrich weapons.  You're going to kill Goliath with your cock.  Like the fucking, like the hammer toss.  He just swings, and his helmet goes right in the pussy.  And he cranks it back out and tries it again, you fucking...  Roman dick.  Oh, yeah, raging.  No problem.  Fuck.  Does yours rage right out the sialis?  Is the sialis, like, just a habit at this point?  My dick is so fucking Pavlov, Pavlov dog to jerk it off.
