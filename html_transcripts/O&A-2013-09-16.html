<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, jumping between personal anecdotes, news events, pop culture commentary, and listener calls.  The show began with Opie, Anthony Cumia, and Jim Norton discussing their seasonal allergies and a recent, unexpectedly cold beach house vacation extending into September.  This transitioned into a serious discussion about a Times Square shooting where police injured two bystanders while attempting to subdue a self-harming individual.  The hosts debated the police response, focusing on firearm trigger pull weight and speculating about gang activity in the area, even mentioning a rumor of strategically-placed movie theaters to deter crime.  They played a bystander's cell phone video of the incident and criticized television news censorship.

The mood then shifted dramatically as the hosts discussed Opie's poorly-filmed cat video, leading to a debate about filming techniques (portrait vs. landscape).  This was followed by a scathing critique of the Miss America pageant, focusing on a former winner's weight gain and broader issues of unrealistic beauty standards.  The conversation spiraled into a discussion about whether attractive women are generally good at anything, using examples of actresses and female athletes.  They watched the trailer for the *Carrie* remake and criticized the actress's casting, citing incongruity with the character. A caller claiming to be "Carrie" briefly joined the conversation before the hosts returned to discussing scary movies and the *Carrie* remake.  More images of female athletes, including a javelin thrower, were examined, prompting further discussion of their attractiveness and abilities.  Finally, *Eat Pray Love* was briefly mentioned.

The next segment veered into a discussion of romance novels and the unrealistic expectations they create for men, employing highly vulgar language to express their frustration with women comparing their partners to fictional characters.  This led to a crude discussion of *Fifty Shades of Grey*, BDSM, and various sex toys, including edible panties.  A New Jersey boardwalk fire was briefly discussed, with the hosts speculating, using offensive language, about arson.  This transitioned into a comparison, again with highly offensive language, between New Jersey residents’ resilience and that of other areas facing similar disasters.

The majority of this segment showcased clips from the cable access show "Stairway to Stardom," featuring amateur singers, dancers, comedians, and magicians.  The hosts reacted with amusement and crude jokes to the low-quality performances.  Wayne Rubin’s impressions and dandruff telethon bit were highlighted, along with the discovery of Jimmy Schwartzman, a singer still performing years later.  The segment concluded with further discussion of "Stairway to Stardom" and future show plans.

Another segment featured the "Meatball Guys" from Mama Mancini's meatballs.  The hosts and guests tasted and praised the meatballs, with a humorous subplot involving one of the Meatball Guys using the bathroom before serving.  Listener anger over the Miss America winner was revisited.  Billy Connolly's cancer diagnosis was also discussed, along with Sam Roberts's limited dietary preferences.  The marketing and placement strategies of Mama Mancini's were analyzed, including darkly humorous suggestions about intimidating competitors.  Finally, a leaked Britney Spears song and its potential popularity were briefly discussed.

The final segment focused on Lorde's song "Royals."  The hosts and numerous callers debated its potential for mainstream success, initially dismissing it as too mellow but acknowledging its growing popularity on alternative stations and its viral spread among younger listeners, including 8-year-olds.  The song was played repeatedly throughout the segment.  The hosts speculated on Lorde's confidence and image, comparing her to other pop artists.  One caller mentioned Selena Gomez covering the song, and a comparison was made to a song from the *Judgment Night* soundtrack.  The segment concluded with the hosts predicting "Royals'" success and playing the song one last time.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Opie, the father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I work here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on live now? Is it happening? This is it?  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment. 
[00:00:30]  And having very few limits.  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is, like, different than any other radio.  No telling what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's not like radio. It's just, like, hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level.  And sane.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real. 
[00:01:00]  Real people, real excitement.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yes, good morning, everyone.  Whee.  Hop on.  Hop on for the ride, everyone.  Welcome to Seasonal Allergies.  Oh.  Well, you know.  The old toilet paper roll, huh?  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Fucking seasonal allergies. 
[00:01:30]  And then, two weeks from now, I'll be fine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When, uh...  When it gets a little colder.  When the shit dries up.  Right.  Well, I don't know.  Maybe, uh...  The shit drying up causes it.  I know.  Are the leaves changing?  What the fuck's going on out there?  Oh, any day now, you'll start seeing a little yellow on that fucking tree, I'm sure.  Fucking leaves.  In my goddamn pool!  Already?  No, not yet.  Oh, okay.  Soon, though.  I'm sure. 
[00:02:00]  I feel like I could have squeezed another weekend out of the beach house.  Probably could have.  Squeeze one more in.  Probably could have.  Someone had a great tweet for me.  For me, personally.  He said, look, I know you're bummed you're leaving the beach house today.  Meaning yesterday.  But what's even worse is staying at a beach when it starts getting cold out.  He goes, that's downright depressing.  Yeah, because you really can't go outside.  It sucks.  He's like, you know, staying too long at a beach house is, like, really sad.  Those movies where they show, like, a couple and they're sitting on little beach chairs. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  And the beach is empty and the wind's blown and they're bundled up.  Right.  And it's supposed to be, like, this nice moment.  I just look and go, oh, no.  No.  Get me off that beach.  I got bamboozled.  You were bamboozled.  Because when I decided to rent this beach house, you know, I was wheeling and dealing.  Yeah.  Because we weren't even sure we wanted to do it.  So I was in a strong position for negotiating.  Take it or leave it kind of a thing.  They threw in two weeks in September. 
[00:03:00]  Like, yeah, we'll give you two weeks in September.  I know why they gave me the two weeks in September now.  Because no one else has taken the two weeks in September.  The house is just sitting there empty.  Yeah.  Because that stupid Labor Day, like we just talked about before we turned the mics on, knows exactly when, like, the season's supposed to end.  This planet knows.  They figured that shit out way before we were born.  That Labor Day, that is it.  It starts getting cold immediately after Labor Day.  Yeah.  You might get squeezed in one of those weird weekends where all of a sudden, you know, it's 85. 
[00:03:30]  But pack your shit because summer's over.  Yeah.  But in general, they just know.  Yeah.  And I'm thinking Labor Day was a beautiful weekend.  I'm like, oh, now I got two fucking more weeks out there.  This is awesome.  No, it was cold both weekends.  Yeah.  And even if you get something good in the daytime where you're actually able to hang out, the second that sun starts going down, it just gets fucking cold.  Oh, man.  It's over, Johnny.  It is over, Johnny.  Start seeing Christmas commercials.  What is that, Kmart running fucking Christmas commercial shit? 
[00:04:00]  The earliest ever, right?  Yeah.  They might as well just keep Christmas up all year long at this point.  Why take it down?  They started taking the lights down in my neighborhood, the Christmas lights, I think in like April.  Yeah.  So you might as well just keep it up for a few more.  Let's fucking leave them up.  A few more months.  Bang, bang.  Right outside our studios, huh?  Well, that's in Times Square right there.  A few blocks away.  8th and 42nd, around there.  Yeah, we know where that is.  I guess what I should point out to the listeners, when all of a sudden we just jump to something else, it's because we watch TV during our radio show. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, the news show.  We got six TVs on, so if you see his jump like that or hear his jump, that's why.  A shooting in Times Square, I guess some crazy guy was acting crazy.  He was by the Port Authority building there on 8th, and it seemed like he wanted to hurt himself or something,  so he started running into traffic, trying to get hit by a car. 
[00:05:00]  And when that wasn't working, he made a motion like he had a gun to the police.  And the police opened fire, shooting two innocent bystanders.  One was a walker, right?  Yeah.  I've fallen and can't get up one.  Not the guy.  Yeah, yeah.  I've been shot and I can't get up.  It's not funny, obviously.  Nah, but...  But that line was kind of funny.  Man, she got shot in the leg, and then someone else got shot in the buttocks. 
[00:05:30]  And the cops are now, you know, in a jam, I guess.  Look at all those cops running around.  And you could say, all right, you know, I should have had a taser or just tackle him or something like that.  But in hindsight, if the guy's reaching and you don't know what he's going to pull out like that, it's marginal.  Well, it's easy to say you should have done something else after the fact when you realized you didn't have a gun.  Obviously, you shouldn't have shot two innocent bystanders.  But if he's gesturing like he might have a gun, then the cops have to make a tough decision there. 
[00:06:00]  It's also, as a gun owner, the 11 and change, 11-pound trigger pull on cops' guns is ridiculous.  It's the hardest thing to fucking...  I don't know what that means, besides, obviously, it's harder to fire.  But, like, what is yours?  It's mine, depending on my pistols, anywhere from two pounds, three pounds.  Are you just weak?  Yes, I'm so weak. 
[00:06:30]  I need...  So going from a 2 to 11, that's a significant difference?  Yeah, it's huge.  It's very hard to shoot accurately with that much pull.  You have to really squeeze that trigger.  Your hand starts shaking a little bit or what have you.  It's just easier to aim and gently squeeze off some shots with a lighter trigger pull.  Until this moment, I didn't even know that was going down.  I just assumed they had the same trigger pull as anyone else.  No, and it's the law.  They have to have...  When did that start? 
[00:07:00]  It's a safety thing.  They think that if the cops have a stronger trigger pull that they can't accidentally shoot it.  That they really have to think twice before they pull the trigger.  It just makes it less accurate.  It's ridiculous.  But when do they put that into effect?  I'm not sure.  I'm not actually not sure.  Or is it something that's been around a while?  It's been around a few years.  Yeah.  But I'm not sure when they enacted it.  But yeah, it's like...  It's tough.  Times Square area, man.  I thought it was supposed to be...  And I say I thought because there's some shit going on out there. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, yeah.  This isn't the only thing.  Well, that guy's a little nutty.  It wasn't gang-y.  I thought it was gang-y because it's gang-y in that area where those theaters are.  It gets a little gang-y.  It gets a little gang-y.  You're absolutely right, especially if you start moving up toward...  Yeah.  If you're moving up 42nd from that point...  Yeah, but it's...  ...toward the actual Times Square where the ball drops.  It definitely gets a little gang-y.  A little gang-y.  But it wasn't.  This guy was just apparently a lunatic running around.  You know, speaking of gang-y, they said that... 
[00:08:00]  There's a rumor, and I would love to know if it's true.  It's been told to us a few times over the years that they actually made two movie theaters in that area just to keep the gang-y down.  Yeah, they're, like, right across the street from each other.  See, Jimmy's even...  That's what I heard, but I might have heard the same source you did, too.  Yeah, who knows?  We might have heard that together.  But supposedly, it's a known fact, like, all right, you go over there, we go over here.  Yeah, yeah.  So we don't have to deal.  Because everyone enjoys a nice movie.  A nice rom-com.  You don't want to be in a gang shootout when you're watching... 
[00:08:30]  When you want to enjoy a rom-com.  When you're watching the latest, let's just say, maybe an Adam Sandler comedy.  There you go.  That's what we heard over the years.  Yeah.  I don't know if it's true.  I don't know either.  But that 8th Avenue and 42nd Street area is a little rough.  A little rough.  People are hilarious.  Figures Anthony's blaming the triggers.  Well, you've got to blame the triggers.  Right?  Yes.  You bastards. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, that's terrible.  The guy's dead, right?  No.  Not dead?  They tased him.  They finally tased him.  Did he actually get shot?  Or just the bystanders?  They missed him completely.  Shot two people.  There were a few rounds.  Can we hear the audio from him?  Because somebody had their little camera phone out.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, you mean...  Oh, s***. 
[00:09:30]  He just shot him.  Oh!  Holy s***.  He's going like this to the top.  He has something in it.  He has something in it.  Just push one second if you can.  Oh, yeah.  This is the f***ing news.  This is some great things happening in this video, by the way.  The profanity is beeped.  Right.  The gunshots are not.  Right.  That's the country we live in.  Yes.  Yeah, isn't it way more horrific to see this scene going down than an F-bomb?  Uh-huh.  Holy s*** gets beeped.  Right.  The sound of an old lady and somebody else having bullets pumped into them. 
[00:10:00]  We're a s***y dumb country.  It's pure lunacy.  And by the way, this deserves landscape mode, not portrait on the vid.  How would you know?  Stop it.  I know, because I know when it's appropriate to go portrait.  Your latest cat video was filmed poorly.  It's a terrible job.  No, it filmed great.  Nope.  It's portrait mode because the cat was jumping up and down.  I needed headroom. 
[00:10:30]  Nope.  Not side to side room.  Beavis doesn't jump that high yet.  Well, let me tell you something.  He f***ed it up.  It was easier to follow him and look at his moves jumping up and down and then track him  side to side.  I didn't need my whole f***ing living room showing with the cat in the middle.  I needed headroom.  That's why I went portrait mode.  You didn't need all that room for the side to side.  Yeah.  No.  When there's a fight at a Denny's, let's say, and people are throwing chairs on one side  and people are f***ing throwing plates on the other, you need to get that entire cinematic 
[00:11:00]  f***ing view.  When it's the cat in the living room jumping up and down, I could keep him in frame and  portrait.  I need the height of the portrait mode.  We like a full frame.  Nothing was missed.  Right.  Nothing was missed in the cat video.  Every bit of that cat was in there.  The cat people are going to f***ing, you know, not accept that video.  That one's not going to go viral.  It was terrible.  I'm sorry.  It was terribly filmed.  You were far, you were far away, far enough away that you could have got all the action.  I don't, no, I don't think so. 
[00:11:30]  I don't think so.  Sorry.  I'm standing by my decision to go portrait mode.  The cat's very cute though.  The cat's adorable.  With his little claws getting caught.  Oh my God.  He's flipping over.  Getting that scared hunchback thing.  Where is this video that no one has seen yet because you just posted it and we're talking  about it like, like it's, like it's Charlie bit my finger.  Let's at least get some views on this damn thing because I don't think the people even  have seen it yet.  It's that one.  There he is. 
[00:12:00]  I yell his name crazy and he goes crazy when I start yelling his name.  Look at all this wasted space.  I feel uncomfortable because if he goes side to side, you don't have it covered.  Beavis.  No.  No, I got him.  Beavis.  You look like you're hiding something.  Beavis.  I need headroom.  Beavis.  No, you don't.  Beavis.  He's not jumping that high.  Beavis.  Okay, but.  Beavis.  No.  He's like a fucking little mouse in the middle of the screen.  You got too much lower rug.  Beavis.  Too much lower rug.  But that's so if he runs up to me.  All right, but what if he runs off to the side? 
[00:12:30]  He's going to go with the darkness.  Beavis.  I got him.  Beavis.  Beavis.  I'd say this was just a lazy man's way of filming.  You think?  Yeah.  Terribly bad.  Beavis.  A lazy man.  What do you mean?  Beavis.  How do they see this damn thing?  Beavis.  I don't know.  Go to.  Oh, forget it.  Beavis.  Just look up.  Beavis freaks out at his name.  It is a very cute.  What is that like that?  Is that your foot that he's coming after or no?  No, it's a little hat on the floor that he likes to play with.  Beavis.  He spins around.  You're giving him very, very bad habits. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, terrible habits.  And he looks like he's already getting pretty big.  That's bitey, bitey kitten.  I haven't actually met the cat yet.  I want to go and meet the cat.  Oh, he's adorable.  Come over.  Bitey, fighty kitten.  Little bitey, fighty kitten.  Go to Anthony's YouTube page.  What is it there?  O-P-A-N-T-X-M.  You got a whole bunch of potential viral videos up there.  Bites mine, though.  I don't want my hand bit.  I want to pet him and have him purr.  Look at him.  He's going crazy there.  A little spotted belly.  Fast forward a year.  You're going to come in here all bandaged up. 
[00:13:30]  I can't wait.  I can't wait.  I think he got me last night.  A Roy Horn situation.  This can't won't make it to two years old.  No?  No, you're going to get rid of it.  No!  You will 100% get rid of it.  I will never get rid of him.  He'll become a full-sized cat.  He's attacking your body parts.  Those cute little claws are going to be fucking daggers in a year from now.  Big boy teeth come in.  No.  Get him a cat post to scratch on.  I got him one.  Oh, with catnip on it?  Well, no.  No catnip.  You are one. 
[00:14:00]  You got to get the catnip.  No, I don't want him going crazy yet.  With the catnip?  You know what wine does for you?  Yeah.  That's what the catnip does for the kitten.  Oh, no.  Racist catnip.  You got to get some catnip.  Oh, well.  The fucking glasses video doing very well there, sir.  That's all right.  Very nice.  So, back to Times Square and the shooting.  Yes.  So, two innocent bystanders.  Yeah, they got hit.  So, now they'll win the fucking city lawsuit lottery. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  That sucks.  Take a bullet for fucking being able to retire for the rest of your life?  Maybe.  What's amazing about this video is they're shooting, and the person filming this is not  even phased at all.  There's two videos, this one and then the one where people are phased, but I think you  can tell there's a white guy who is completely, get down, get down, and then this guy, who  sounds like he might be a black gentleman, just going like, oh, man. 
[00:15:00]  It's like he's seeing a movie or something.  Yeah, look at this.  Oh, shit.  This is live.  Amazing.  Like, it's steady camera work.  Yeah.  He should have turned his phone sideways, obviously.  I wish the iPhone would figure that out.  I wish they would figure out how to make the camera adjust to that.  Yeah.  There's got to be a way to do it.  Shouldn't it just, they should just film it one way, no matter how you turn your camera.  Probably.  Right?  Sometimes it's more convenient to hold it in portrait mode, but you want to film in landscape 
[00:15:30]  mode.  They should be able to have an option where you do that.  That's what I'm saying, yeah.  Like, have an option all the time, it'll film landscape, no matter what.  Exactly.  I think, yeah.  They can get that done.  I always get confused when I'm filming.  Do you?  I do.  I get scared and frightened.  Frightened.  But the guy is smooth.  Listen to him for another few seconds here.  He's just smooth.  Just take it all in.  Oh.  Oh.  They think he's dead there, but he's getting back up. 
[00:16:00]  Oh my God.  Did they tase him right there?  Just beat him.  Wood shampoo.  Oh.  Holy ****. 
[00:16:30]  Holy ****.  Dude, we should get out of here, dude.  We should get out of here, dude.  That's a white guy.  Yeah.  Yeah, but the...  But no, was he shooting blanks?  Blanks.  No, no, no, he wasn't there.  Was he shooting blanks?  Holy ****.  Whites and blacks are so different.  Yes.  He's just like, black guy, we're all assuming he's black. 
[00:17:00]  Man.  Oh, man.  And the white guy.  Dude, dude, we should leave, man.  We should get out of here, man.  We should get imprudent.  Yeah.  Yeah, chaotic scene in Times Square.  Man.  Let's see.  A couple of fucking...  A couple of fucking cops and supervisors and shit are gonna be a little jammed up now.  Oh, boy.  A bit of a jam the next couple of days.  Transferred to, um...  Desk, uh, duty?  A desk duty in some shit-fucking precinct. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, that sucks.  Poor bastards.  But you gotta have incredible confidence to go, all right, there's people behind.  Dude, right?  But I think I can hit them.  I think I can hit them.  I think I got them here.  I know.  How do you open fire in fucking Times Square like that?  There wasn't one place that didn't have people as a backdrop.  Right.  You know?  How do you open fire like that unless you're absolutely seeing an imminent danger?  Balloon Not Joe says it's 16 pounds for a trigger pull since mid-90s. 
[00:18:00]  Six?  I heard 11.  I didn't hear 16.  He's saying 16.  Yeah.  Where?  I don't know.  I heard 11, so...  Since the mid-90s.  That's crazy.  So what happened in the mid-90s?  What was the big event that changed this?  I don't know.  I guess, uh...  I don't know.  95, 96-ish, right?  Maybe they started getting automatics?  Instead of those revolvers?  Is that happening?  Oh, the city's so fucked.  Yeah.  We got shitty choices for the next mayor. 
[00:18:30]  Oh.  We're going to wish Bloomberg was still around.  This will be a fucking daily occurrence.  Shootings on the streets.  It'll be great.  Even with the Afro kid?  Even with the Afro kid.  He's the one where we're electing mayor, right?  Yeah, the Afro kid.  Not his dad.  Right.  De Blasio.  Good old De Blasio.  De Blasio.  And Lolo...  Jolo Loda.  Jolo Loda.  Loda.  Gotta pronounce that L-H combo.  Jolo Loda.  Loda.  Loda. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  I think it's going to be, you know, Democrat, though.  Yeah.  Yep.  And then you're going to see some fucking shit.  Hopefully.  I like a little fucking anarchy.  It's because you live in Long Island.  Yeah.  Just come back and watch like a movie on the news.  Ooh, look what just happened a mere few miles away.  One of them said something I liked, though.  I don't remember who it was.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Me?  It had to be Loda.  No, but it might have been one of the Democrats.  That's why I'm thinking. 
[00:19:30]  Really?  Yeah.  What?  Fucking Stomp and Frisk.  Yeah.  Fucking Independent Review Board.  Yeah, it's all good stuff.  Sure.  Rich giving all their money up.  Right.  Oh, great.  Right.  All stuff that worked in the 70s.  To go to education.  Meanwhile, money gets thrown at schools like crazy, and it still doesn't do shit because  it's not going to the right places.  Right.  Yeah.  I have zero desire to keep giving to fucking education.  Yeah.  When there are great teachers, and then there's shit teachers, too, who can't be fired. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, yeah.  They can't be fired.  Yep, yep.  And there's shit parents.  How about education?  Fixing the shit parents in these houses.  That's the problem.  Exactly.  Fucking shit.  Terrible.  How is education?  If it was mandatory, like, you can't fucking pump a load into a girl until you have a fucking  job?  I'd be for that.  Yes.  You have to pull out until you have a job.  That would be pretty good.  Yeah.  Right?  Fuck yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:20:30]  So what?  Miss America got fat?  The old one?  I was watching the Miss America pageant, of course, after an unbelievable episode of  Breaking Bad.  How amazing was that one?  It was fucking, could perhaps be the best hour of television ever put on television.  I might have to agree with you on that one.  It was so insane.  You didn't see it.  What?  You didn't see it.  You see how good I am now?  I want to see it.  That's all you have to do to sound informed.  Yeah.  See?  You're right.  You're right.  That's all you needed to do.  I might have to agree with you. 
[00:21:00]  Best hour ever.  It was insanely intense.  The entire episode was one of those edgiest seat, fucking anxiety-inducing episodes.  How many more have they got?  Two more left.  I've got to watch the series.  I've got to do it.  And last night literally could have been the finale episode, and it would have been fine  with everybody.  Wow.  It was that good.  Wow.  Oh, just crazy.  Oh, my man.  A little waste.  That's it. 
[00:21:30]  Wait, Miss America really did get pudgy.  Dude.  She, um...  And you know what?  Last year's Miss America comes out.  Wow.  Did she have to...  Wow.  That's sexy, though.  She looks good, though.  Oh, stop it.  Yeah, but I mean...  Look at the original picture.  She's got thunder thighs.  Look at the original picture.  And a bit soft in the midsection.  They always bring up the...  But it made her boobs bigger.  They always bring up the ex, you know, the one that's going to be thrown out there from  last year, to take the last walk on the stage before they crown the new Miss America. 
[00:22:00]  And she came out, and there was some voiceover thing going, some really big things happened.  You know, it's been a huge year, and every time she made a big reference, I just was like,  oh, yeah, okay.  Is there a video?  I want to see how big she actually looks on stage.  She doesn't look big, because she dressed and covered everything.  She had this little one-inch strip of gut hanging out in between her bottoms and her...  And she had her tits, like, squeezed in, so it was a lot of cleavage.  But you could tell, she put on some pounds. 
[00:22:30]  And their whole job is to make sure they don't put on a few pounds and just look hot.  You're fucking Miss America.  Don't try to tell me it's more than that.  Put it this way.  Don't get your body to the point where you wouldn't have been able to win if you looked  like that.  Oh, yeah, they've got to be emaciated, right?  Yes!  For the most part.  So I was getting called misogynistic.  Oh, my God, that's her?  On the right?  The one in the white?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Holy shit, she did get a lot bigger.  I was getting called misogynistic, because I was... 
[00:23:00]  Wait, which one's the new Miss America?  The new one's the Indian girl.  That's losing her fucking mind, and the one on the right is the old one.  Yeah, see how she's dressed?  She covers everything up.  Yeah, she got big.  Like, and, you know, in that world, if you get big, sorry, you're going to be made fun  of, because...  Exactly.  That's true.  You won based on that fucking...  Why did she have her body looking like it did in the pageant?  Right.  All slender and yummy.  That is true.  In that world, you sign up for my fucking...  Oh, my gosh.  She's got, like, a...  She's got a double chin.  Double chin. 
[00:23:30]  Jowls.  Big fat arms.  Yes.  Yeah, because that's...  People are like, fuck you, you piece of shit.  This pageant is dumb anyway.  It stinks.  They try to make it sound like it's more than it is.  It's a, you know, a hot piece of ass contest, basically.  It is.  What do you think?  People are really voting based on how one girl spun...  She was spinning batons!  Like, it's fucking eighth grade.  How delightful!  It stunk.  If it...  If the winners were so important... 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  I challenge you right now to name five past winners.  Oh.  Because they did such...  Well.  Because they did such amazing...  Anita Bryant.  Ooh.  He's going for it.  Lee Merriweather.  Vanessa Williams.  Vanessa Williams.  How about...  How about in recent times?  Well, you didn't say that.  Well, he's talking about his high school days.  That's fair.  Who are a couple more?  I want recent winners.  Oh, man.  Because they did such great shit for this planet.  And you just know their names now. 
[00:24:30]  Edna Trudusky?  Oh, fuck.  I've never heard.  Edna.  Edna.  Wouldn't that be awful Miss America with Edna Trudusky?  The new Miss America is Edna Trudusky!  It's T-R-D-U-S-K-Y.  There's only one vowel.  Trudusky.  Horrible.  Yeah.  I guess it was between her and Miss California at the end.  And, boy, they...  But you had a tweet saying the old one got fat. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And they came out of the woodworks.  Yeah, the people get mad when you mention that the woman that won a beauty contest based  on her slender body gained weight over the course of the year as Miss America.  And I mentioned it, and I'm the asshole.  Because people are phony crocs of shit.  Political correct douchebags.  They don't think it matters when it actually does.  They'll fuck themselves.  That's why most people watch those things.  Exactly.  You get to see some beautiful specimens. 
[00:25:30]  Two years in a row, Miss New York.  Wow, really?  Yeah, they ushered in a new one and ushered out the fat one.  Yeah, they got rid of the chubby one.  Yeah, but then that talent competition.  They're all such mediocre everything that they do.  They're mediocre.  Like, the singing is...  Because the girls had to be...  They're pretty enough to not have to be good at anything.  Right.  So they didn't have to be the best singer.  The fucking girl that was a little weird looking, she had to be the really good singer.  The dancers, you know, they don't have dancer bodies, first of all. 
[00:26:00]  Those real skinny fucking, like, ballet kind of things.  Because ballet dancers are kind of weird looking, too.  They're really fucking, you know, lanky and shit.  So they're buxom and stuff, and they're trying to do it.  They're just not very good at what they do.  Violin player.  I couldn't even tell if she was good or bad.  They're average at a bunch of things.  Yes, they're very average.  Miss Rhode Island, she did something with some doves. 
[00:26:30]  Name one hot girl that's really good at something.  Oh, the doves died.  No, that's right.  Oh.  Yeah, they got cold and got doused with water the night before.  So she sang, and it wasn't really good.  What happened to the doves?  I guess somebody was staying at the hotel room above them,  and she put the doves out on the patio of the hotel room,  and they were making noise all night.  So the people that were in the room above thought it was just pigeons.  So they dumped their water bucket, the ice bucket of water,  and it landed on her pigeons, and they killed them. 
[00:27:00]  Landed on the doves.  So she had to sing instead of do the pigeon act.  They killed her fucking birds?  And they killed her pigeons.  Are they pigeons or doves?  They were doves.  Oh, okay.  Did they feel bad about it?  No, they didn't really seem to feel bad about it.  What fucking cocks?  Yeah.  Then again, fuck her and her noisy birds.  One guy was Jerry, and the other guy was George.  Wow.  And they dumped...  Oh, I thought you were telling the truth.  I was like, why did I hear this ever? 
[00:27:30]  I'm sitting here watching Jimmy in amazement.  She was like, oh, they killed the dogs?  I told you I don't watch Jimmy.  I know, you don't watch Jimmy.  Yeah, that was the storyline.  Kramer was her trainer guy and recommended she sing a song instead of doing the pigeon act  because her pigeons were now dead, and she was terrible.  Oh, that's funny.  I'm so fucking...  I'm actually happy that that's not true.  Yes, of course.  Oh, look at that.  Look at the face she's making while the lady puts a crown.  Is she really happy, or is the woman fucking... 
[00:28:00]  She's poking her with a fucking...  She's pegging her, as we like to say.  There was a little controversy, too, because a lot of tweets came through from ignorant  people that were like, oh, how did a Muslim win, and an Arab, and she's Indian.  People were upset.  They were asking, did everybody forget about 9-11?  She's Indian.  Are you serious?  I'm very close to being done with Twitter.  It's just a teetering act, you know?  Isn't it?  It's just an ugly place to hang out. 
[00:28:30]  It is.  Like a really ugly place.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, because it could be such a cool thing.  It was a cool bar that opened up somewhere, and then the clientele started going downhill,  and now it just seems like a bunch of bikers that'll hit you with a pool cue when you walk in.  It's terrible.  I tweeted a picture of a dumb beach fire.  Oh.  Last day at the beach, we had this huge roaring fire for like three straight hours.  A lot of enjoyable retweets?  One guy goes, I get it, you like the beach! 
[00:29:00]  It's like, why are you angry?  Why would he?  Who would be angry at a dumb picture of a student?  I'm not, I wasn't, I wasn't going for a viral fucking tweet.  I'm like, ah, this is what I'm doing.  Fucking costuckers.  Because, you know, I mean, we have a fan base to the point where, you know, they kind of  like to have a little peek in.  He is what I'm up to, right.  Right.  I wasn't trying to set, quote, the world on fire, but this guy, and I know he means  it.  That's the sad part.  Of course he does.  We're dead and you like the beach! 
[00:29:30]  What an asshole!  Why is he an asshole?  He likes the beach.  Oh!  And I'm not, and I swear to you, I'm not even mad.  It's just like, serious, like...  Did you just block?  No, I didn't block.  Wow.  No.  I'm a blocking machine now.  I mean, I block, but no, it was just like, I mean, what's wrong with this guy's life that  he really felt like he had to attack a beach fire picture? 
[00:30:00]  Leave it to Anthony to get more young pussy in his outfit!  Oh, God.  A thousand times like it's brandy new.  I'm fucking hilarious.  All right, Chip, I understand.  Oh, you should have.  It's like...  And then you go, like, all right, why bother then?  Why bother?  You're right.  It's all something, like this tweet.  Miss New York is an Indian.  With all due respect, this is America.  Do is D-O.  All due respect. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, wow.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So...  Doesn't make any sense.  All due respect.  Yeah.  So name one really hot girl that's really good at something.  Egypt dancing.  This is America.  Hashtag Miss America.  Egypt dancing.  Can you...  She was doing traditional Indian dance.  Hot girl who's good at something.  Hot girl good at something.  And it's on to something that, you know, when you're coming up in school, you don't...  If you're hot, especially if you're a hot girl, you don't really have to be good at anything in particular. 
[00:31:00]  You can be average at a bunch of things.  Yep.  And for some reason, society has decided to accept that.  Very average.  Because you're right, there's like, you know, the...  There's amazing singers out there and stuff, but they don't look like Katy Perry.  A little quirky.  Right.  So you're never going to see them at the VMAs.  And they're probably more talented than her, dare I say that.  Yeah.  Because she is pretty talented and hot at the same time.  She is, yeah.  So she might be one of the answers to that question. 
[00:31:30]  Scarlett Johansson's very good at acting.  Yeah, the acting thing is a little weird.  Does that not count?  I don't know, because they're really hot.  Are you only singing and dancing?  No, no, just in general.  I'm trying to think.  Because acting, there's quite a few, but I can't think of a great...  Who's a really hot singer?  Yeah, but going back to Anne's thing, I bet you there's way better actresses, but they're  not good-looking.  So they never get the chances in Hollywood like maybe a Scarlett Johansson got.  Maybe.  I don't know.  Julia Roberts is a great actress.  Yes, she is.  And she's very hot. 
[00:32:00]  I don't think Julia Roberts.  She always got that, like, oh, the most beautiful smile.  And it's this big fucking Joker grin.  Fuck her.  Well, she's still good actress, though.  Despite her toothy grin.  Did you ever see, and I swear I've never seen the whole movie, but every once in a while  I'll see a scene or two of that eat, pray, leave fucking thing that she did.  Eat, pray, love?  And what?  She's like, what is her problem?  I never saw a second of it.  But I think she goes to India to try to find herself, but she's a hot broad, but she can't, 
[00:32:30]  like, fucking commit to another guy or something.  All right, I hope you've done a good job of making it seem like you don't know it.  I'm like, she would never have these problems in the real world.  Julia Roberts doesn't have those type of problems.  Wouldn't a frumpier girl in that role?  Exactly.  But they can't commit to that.  Well, this is the problem I had with, oh, boy, and I think Roland will be mad because  I think somebody's coming in as a guest.  The movie Carrie, the remake. 
[00:33:00]  We've got to be honest.  Carrie is coming out.  Maybe she turns us around.  Maybe.  It's the girl from Kick-Ass.  She's hot.  Who is growing up into a very pretty girl.  Attractive girl, right.  Yes, Chloe Moretz is her name.  And she's playing the part that Sissy Spacek played in the original.  She's just too cute.  She's too cute for that role.  Sissy Spacek was a gangly-looking, pale, freckle-faced, stringy-haired, frumpy girl. 
[00:33:30]  She wasn't pretty.  She wasn't, like, horrendous where you're shielding your eyes.  She was the girl that just no one noticed in school.  That worked perfectly.  This doesn't work.  She's too cute.  You dump the blood on the hot chick.  She's still a hot chick.  Exactly.  So she takes a shower and she still walks around as a hot chick.  What made it work with Sissy Spacek is, like, holy fuck, this is pathetic because when she  does wash the blood off, she's still just a frump. 
[00:34:00]  The popular guy taking her to the prom isn't out of the question.  Of course.  It worked in the original because why would the guy take scary, scary, scary, scary to  the fucking prom when she looks like this and she's all sheepish?  Oh, why would they do that?  I don't know.  We used the example before of in Shallow Howl, the big speech about depth and beauty is only  skin deep.  They can't even let the big, fat pig make the speech.  They have to give it to Gwyneth Paltrow.  Again.  They fucking...  Hollywood genuinely stinks. 
[00:34:30]  Well, because they have to have that dumb moral message by the end of a clever concept.  But they couldn't even let the fat girl make the real speech.  It would have felt like something.  And it's also that they have to...  Look how hot she looks as Carrie.  Look how hot she looks with the blood.  You're not...  Would you be sitting there pointing and laughing at her?  No.  You'd be like, holy fuck, she's hot, but let's get her showered up.  She'd be the girl under the fucking stairs with her hand on the fucking rope for the bucket  of blood.  Right.  Every white knight would be helping her?  Yes.  Exactly.  That's why it's just a little off. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, why would they do that?  Because they know it'll bring in the younger crowd to have her in there.  Is there a trailer?  Again, same thing that Jimmy was saying.  Yeah, there's a trailer.  I haven't seen the trailer for it.  Yeah, maybe...  It should have been...  I'm trying to think of what actress would have been really good looks-wise for that part.  How's the girl...  The girl from Evil Dead was even cute.  I didn't see the movie, but she was very cute when she was in.  She wasn't bad looking.  Maybe an unknown. 
[00:35:30]  Maybe.  Carrie, official trailer.  Right now we're looking at grass and a house.  Oh, right.  Fade to black.  In every neighborhood, there is one family.  White letters, black background.  Oh.  With a secret.  A secret.  She's making clothes.  Oh, Julianne Moore, right?  Julianne Moore is the mother.  If you remember, Piper Laurie, I believe, played the mother in the original.  Damn, I don't remember that.  The other kids, they think I'm weird.  Oh.  Jerry, favorite poem? 
[00:36:00]  Did you bring one?  I don't want to bring it.  Look, she's too cute.  She's too cute.  Put that smile on your face.  I have to try and be a whole person.  No.  She's beautiful.  It's not working.  Oh, wow.  She's naked.  Help us.  The cross is set of her days in life.  She's made innocent to the curse of the Lord.  That's not even in the Bible.  It doesn't say that anywhere.  Go to your closet and pray.  No.  Pray.  No!  Go to your closet and pray.  Jesus Christ.  I want to see her dirty pillows. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, me too.  Mom's nuts.  The door cracked.  If I concentrate hard enough, I can make things move.  Yeah.  Kegel muscles.  Ping pong balls.  She's reading all these.  She's floating things in her room.  Oh, wow.  Telekinesis.  You know the devil never dies?  Keeps coming back. 
[00:37:00]  You gotta keep killing him.  No!  The mother should be nice to her there.  Promise next week.  Yeah.  You don't have a date already?  Maybe you want to go with me?  Another good looking...  A beautiful guy.  Of course.  No, no.  Oh, no.  She's going.  They're going to laugh at you.  They're all going to laugh at you.  Mama, stop it.  They've given away the whole movie.  Yeah.  Well, everyone knows the story, but...  I don't know if the younger generation does.  She's fucking high.  She's at 10.  She looks great. 
[00:37:30]  She looks beautiful.  You're king and queen are...  Look at her.  She looks great.  What the fuck?  This is nonsense.  Oh, my goodness.  Now, she even looks great covering the blood.  Look at how hot she looks.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  It's...  I don't...  Why do they do that?  Why could...  You could call Carrie.  Yeah.  Oh, well. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, well, 855...  There is a phone number there.  Why does it say call Carrie?  Should we call Carrie?  What's up, girl?  Should we call Carrie?  Hey.  Hi.  This is Carrie.  See my movie.  Go back.  What's the number?  Let's call Carrie.  What's up, girlfriend?  Yeah.  Jimmy, call Carrie.  All right.  Hold on.  Right there.  One.  John Travolta was in...  Call it from here.  ...in the original, too.  Yes.  He was the guy who killed the pig and got the blood.  All right.  Yeah.  You know, after seeing that trailer, I don't hate it. 
[00:38:30]  I don't hate that she's hot.  Yeah, but it takes away from the entire reason for the movie.  Yeah.  Like, she should have...  She doesn't seem weird enough.  No.  That's the girl who wouldn't talk to you in high school.  Yes!  Not the girl that you wouldn't talk to.  You fucking bitch!  Right!  Jesus.  Well, there's the number.  You rock?  E to the R.  E to the R to the O-C-K. 
[00:39:00]  Pick up line 10.  Why?  That's where he's calling us.  Carrie.  Hi, Carrie.  Oh, everyone's calling the devil girl.  Oh, no.  She's probably on the phone with Lucifer.  Hang up.  I don't want to talk to the devil.  Yes, William Catt, if you remember, greatest American hero, was her date in the original.  Okay, sir.  Yes, he gets hit on the head with the bucket.  Did he die that way? 
[00:39:30]  Um, uh, no one is spared in that movie.  No, no, but did he die from the bucket hitting him?  No, he gets a concussion.  I think he falls down and gets knocked out and burns up in the gymnasium with everybody else.  But she didn't kill him on purpose.  No, but she was pretty pissed.  She didn't know that he, uh, wasn't in on it.  So, she just killed everybody.  I kind of like the movie.  I kind of like the trailer.  What's her name with the curly hair?  She lived, but she was, you know, haunted for the rest of her life.  Well, then, you know, that's...  She had that dream that she's at the end. 
[00:40:00]  Right.  And she's putting the flowers down by Carrie's grip.  Then the arm comes out!  Oh, and grabs her arm.  It was the scariest moment in movies up until that fucking head came out from, uh...  Jaws.  Fucking, yeah.  No, Jaws was first.  Ben Garner's fucking...  Yeah, it was?  Of course.  Before Carrie?  Yeah.  And I'll tell you what was scary.  It was the fucking...  The Jason coming out at the end of the original Friday the 13th.  Yeah, it was pretty goddamn scary, too.  Because that was before every movie did that.  Like, you really thought that was the end of the movie, and she's waving.  Oh, look!  She's on the lake, waving at the office. 
[00:40:30]  And it's all's well that ends well.  Fucking monster.  Jonathan Blatt, who I went to school with, told me that happened.  Yeah.  And I still fucking screamed.  Did ya?  Yeah, I guess he...  I don't remember why he told me.  But I fucking still...  It horrified me.  Yeah.  I don't like scary movies.  Oh, that's fucking scary.  I'll watch them here and there, but I don't search them out like a lot of people do.  I love a good...  I heard the new Insidious stinks, of course. 
[00:41:00]  I heard PG-13.  I screamed, fuck you, at my television.  Yeah, it's gotta be R.  I don't want a PG horror movie.  No.  R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R 
[00:41:30]  Put some ugly makeup on her.  She's cute.  Yeah, what could they have done to ugly her up?  The old glasses routine.  Yeah, the old cat glasses and a bad ponytail.  Or a crew cut.  They should have her mother shave her head, make her walk around with a crew cut.  And facial hair.  Yeah.  A mustache.  A mustache and fucking...  We can't feel for people like that.  They don't think people will be able to feel or have a crush on her. 
[00:42:00]  It's such a weird thinking.  She should be a gangly, awkward girl.  Not a knockout.  Who wouldn't want to take Carrie?  Oh, God, she's a 10 and she makes shits float?  I'll suck you dirty pillows.  Come on, let's run away.  Sissy Spacek was perfect for that.  Yeah.  Just gangly and fucking stringy looking.  And your mother was a porn star.  Yes.  In Boogie Nights, she has no right to say anything.  Fucking...  Yeah, she fucked Dirk Diggler.  She certainly did.  He made her womb float on his penis. 
[00:42:30]  I love that.  Sorry.  Watch my stickers.  I have stickers from the Daily News.  Whoa.  $30.  $30.  New Insidious isn't bad.  Okay.  What?  You saw it?  The first one was really scary until they showed the monster fucking knitting a sweater.  Muah ha ha ha.  Muah ha ha.  Oh, you cunt.  Ruined it.  Yeah, yeah.  Wait, we got a golfer that's hot? 
[00:43:00]  Still working on the whole...  A woman that's really hot and really good at something.  Good at something.  And the acting thing is a little rough, I think.  It is.  Maybe that's hard.  I don't know.  Daryl, what's up?  Hey, you guys can check this out.  Natalie Gulbis.  G-U-L-B-I-S.  She's LPGA.  Does she win tournaments?  I don't know.  The record's not phenomenal, but you got to check out the picture.  Her face is a little rough. 
[00:43:30]  Her body's really nice, though.  Oh, yeah.  She's hot for a golfer?  Yeah.  For a golfer?  She looks a little...  Her face looks a little bit like Nikki...  Nikki, the comedian we've had in.  Nikki from Nikki and Sarah.  Nikki Glaser?  Yeah, a little bit.  That's not bad.  Depends on the angle.  What does she look like in her golf attire?  Yeah, sure, golf.  Because we all get tricked when you see that bikini.  That ain't bad.  That would be pretty good on the golf course.  Look at her stretching.  There's a picture of her with the golf club behind her back when she's stretching. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  I'd rather see her fucking straddling.  It's like a three-legged monster.  Big-titted monster.  Yeah.  I love it.  Big-titted monster.  Thank you.  She calls for the fucking, like, the putter, and then she just fucking...  And one pops out.  A little slippery.  You would think with big tits like that, you would push every shot.  You'd think, right?  You'd get those fucking hands around.  She got the big tits on her.  She's going to be pushing everything off.  She'll quit the game. 
[00:44:30]  Soccer player Alex Miller.  Let's see Alex Miller there, Sam, please.  I think Anne made a very good point.  When we were growing up,  the hot girls didn't have to be phenomenal at anything.  Nope.  Just okay or average.  What the fuck?  I don't know.  Alex Miller.  A bunch of guys.  Alex Morgan.  Oh, this guy's Hugh Miller.  Dummy.  Oh, he's full of turkey.  Alex.  Whoa.  All right.  All right.  Now.  Let's see.  Oh.  No. 
[00:45:00]  Boy, she's got the itty-bitties.  Well, look, she's got nothing like a straight line kind of thing going on.  I finally grew up and I don't need big, huge monster boobs, but you have to have something  that at least looks like it's, it's female.  She is as flat as, as, as possible.  Face is nice though.  Hmm.  Yeah.  She's all right.  That guy called up like, you know, she's a sliced bread. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  You saw, you saw the javelin broad, right?  What javelin broad?  She's the hottest female athlete ever.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Where did you say the javelin broad?  I don't even know her name.  She's, she's.  Javelin broad.  She's been in the Olympics and stuff, but she doesn't really do well, but she is ridiculous.  Somebody comes up with it.  Yeah, this broad.  Yeah?  That's her name.  Look at this broad.  Holy fuck.  What the fuck?  Look at this broad.  A little bit more so I can see into her crotch, Sam.  Yeah, right?  What's her name?  Hmm.  Look at. 
[00:46:00]  Allison Stoke.  Look at that one right next to the one you popped.  Go up again with her number leaning down.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah.  Look at this broad.  Oh, yeah.  She's very pretty.  Holy shit.  I'll tell you someone pretty who's good at something since we're unathletes.  Look at this.  Jesus.  That's her.  Can you see her nipples?  In a see-through fucking big-titted shirt.  They're not shy in other countries.  They don't give a fuck about the nipples like we do in America.  Yeah.  They'll show you a nipple or two.  We do hate a nipple.  Misha Tate.  Attractive.  Good fighter. 
[00:46:30]  For a fighter.  She's a 10.  Lovely.  For a, you know.  Well, look at this javelin broad, though.  Look at the one with the yellow flowers.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, look at that.  Oh, go up.  Sorry.  Yeah, look at the yellow flower.  I mean, look at this.  She looks like fucking Apollonia.  She got a boyfriend?  I'll fucking dare her.  Her name is, uh...  Alison Stoke.  Huh?  Alison Stoke.  Where's she from?  Isn't it Lauren Franco?  Or is that the one that took the photo?  Hmm. 
[00:47:00]  Where?  It says javelin throw.  Learn...  Learn...  L-E-R-Y-N Franco.  Hmm.  Maybe that's her name.  Yeah, if you want to check her out for yourself.  Lauren Frank...  L-E-R-Y-N.  Frank Cole.  Some say she's the hottest female athlete in the world.  But she doesn't really win.  Very attractive.  That's why you see more and more pictures of her and just her bra.  Yeah.  We have the young Anakornikova picks.  If you're not winning goals, you gotta fucking wear bras.  The young Anakornikova picks, you know, pretty and everything, but she wasn't very good at playing tennis. 
[00:47:30]  She didn't really win a lot.  She didn't win a lot.  That's what it's been for all these athletes that people have brought up.  Like, not great at javelin, not great at soccer, not great at...  And the whole thing we're saying is that they gotta be really good at something.  Goes back to Anne's point.  Mediocre.  What about the one, uh...  Oh, man.  I got every Google image of this girl.  That fucking lanky picture of walking down a little runway.  Oh, right there.  Holding her javelin like it might be something else.  I like it might be something else.  Right there.  Something else.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, that's pretty fucking good. 
[00:48:00]  Yep.  All right.  Is her ass good?  Let me see her ass.  Turn out to the other side, Sam, so I can see her shit fucking pumper.  I want to see a better profile shot.  So far, I am not impressed with her fucking, uh...  Look at her.  Her shit maker.  No?  No.  It looks good, but it looks a little flat.  Might be a little too exotic for Anthony, though.  Well, that...  Where are you on the exotic scale with this one?  I don't mind her.  She's not bad.  Come on.  Let me see her fucking...  Let me see her fudge producer.  Quickly.  Get on to it.  That's why none of the pictures show her fucking asshole, because she knows. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah?  It's flat.  I don't think so.  Oh, flat ass makes me fucking angry.  Whoa, look at...  Oh, go two over from...  Well, that one's beautiful, too.  Two over from what you just did, Sam.  Oh, right there.  Let's see.  Oh.  All right.  I don't know.  What do you mean you don't know?  No, I mean Jimmy.  I don't know.  That looks pretty good.  Let me see.  Oh, yeah.  That's not bad.  That's where you are.  That's small.  But it looks like she's pushing it out.  She almost has boy hips.  I want to just see a better...  I might see a good profile.  How about that?  How about that?  Yeah, it's nice. 
[00:49:00]  It's not great, but it's nice.  It's nice enough to fucking sniff after a javelin throw.  You want to see the trailer for Eat, Pray, Leaves?  More than I want to fucking breathe, I want to see that.  It's an old movie, honestly.  It is an older movie.  Now.  I mean...  When did it come out?  What year was this?  I don't know.  Maybe...  Eat, Pray, Leaves.  That's just a dumb movie about some broad going indie to find herself or something. 
[00:49:30]  More phoniness, though.  That's what I'm saying.  You will live a long time.  Have many friends.  Many experiences.  You will lose all your money.  Don't worry.  You will get it all back again.  And you will come back to Bali.  And then...  We'll go to Bangkok Palace.  I will teach you everything I know.  Bring back the stone.  When some guy who, yes, looks a little like Yoda hands you a prophecy, you have to respond. 
[00:50:00]  I get it.  It's your life raft right now.  Just like a couple of years ago when you were completely consumed with being the perfect wife.  Mom, when did you accept the life you had?  Oh, my baby.  Always searching for something.  This looks terrible!  Your underwear, my queen.  Oh.  Just folded my dog.  Can you prank us in this?  Oh, my God, baby.  You are in so much trouble.  People start resembling their dogs.  You used to look like Steven. 
[00:50:30]  You kind of look like...  Didn't that guy used to host that fucking show on Nickelodeon?  Since I was...  Guts.  Let's just tap out.  Yeah.  This was a massive book.  It is stupid.  Eat, Pray, Love was a fucking...  It was on the bestseller list for a fucking year.  A bunch of stupid little yappy fucking women reading that shit.  Yeah, which looks awful.  And then they all look at us like, okay.  Yeah.  You're not sexy.  You're not like the guy in the book.  That's why I hate...  I used to hate those books. 
[00:51:00]  I went out with a broad...  Reading that book, you're just like, oh boy.  I went out with a broad.  I was into those books.  And then you're just on the couch trying to fucking live your life.  And you can tell how they're looking at you.  Like, oh, you're not the guy that's in the book I'm reading.  Yeah, live up to that.  Right.  As I'm sitting there laughing at an episode of Good Times.  Right, exactly.  Like a retard.  You're just on the couch looking like a frump.  And your stupid fucking broad is looking at you funny.  Check this card on camera.  Look what he does.  I'm trying to remember some of those dumb books that came out. 
[00:51:30]  We got to go back now for this.  It's like 10, 12 years ago.  And I remember the side looks I would get.  I'm like, what?  I'm a shock jock.  Go find the fucking guy in the book if you want to.  The guy in the book doesn't exist.  That's your prerogative.  The guy in the book doesn't exist.  I'm going to go in today and I'm going to look at tits with my pal Anthony.  Tits.  And you go off and find that...  You'll find the guy.  You'll find that perfect guy in that stupid novel you're reading. 
[00:52:00]  I wish I had examples of the books I don't remember anymore.  Man.  But I remember.  I was supposed to be...  I was supposed to be like a...  Like she thought she was Prince's die.  And I was supposed to be fucking one of the fucking...  Donnie Fyand.  I don't know.  I was supposed to be her fucking prince.  I'm like, go find your own fucking prince.  I'm who I am.  Oh yeah.  It's like Oprah's Book Club books.  Yeah.  I'm trying to remember some of those books.  Fifty Shades of Grey.  I don't know.  I don't even know what that book's about for real.  A lot of bitches like it, so I'm sure it stinks. 
[00:52:30]  I know there's a lot of sex in that book.  Fifty Shades of Grey?  Yeah.  It's about S&M, I think, or something.  Yeah.  But it's like women like it, S&M.  It's that way.  So it's like he fucks you with a dildo and then does the dishes.  Yes.  Yes.  Exactly.  Who's the perfect man?  Yeah.  But it's like that cute S&M where, oh, you're kind of tied up, but we all know.  Yeah.  With the fuzzy handcuffs.  Oh, the fuzzy pink handcuffs with no key. 
[00:53:00]  Don't worry.  I'll just boof my way out of it, Ralph.  A boof.  Right.  Yeah, I hate that fake.  If you're not going to do it for real, I'm not even into it.  No, I'm not either.  But if it's this phony, let's spice up the marriage, hon.  Let's get this S&M play kit.  Oh, God.  Fucking a bunch of props.  You need real rope and duct tape and a fucking ball peen hammer. 
[00:53:30]  I think I told a story.  I had a girl in college and we got the edible panties, but this is so far, long ago, they  didn't have that shit figured out.  They looked terrible.  It looked ridiculous.  It looked like a fucking cherry-colored diaper on her.  Yeah, they never looked sexy.  They were like fruit roll-ups.  And the whole thing was just melting all over the place before.  It was just horrible.  Sticking to the comforter and those sheets. 
[00:54:00]  Back then, no one shaved, so there's fucking pubes in it, embedded in it.  Right.  But, I mean, the packaging makes it look like it's the most amazing pair of panties ever.  Sexy.  And you pull it out, it's just horrible.  She puts skid marks in edible panties.  That's terrible.  It's just horrible.  Now they make edible panties out of those, like, the old candy necklaces.  Oh, really?  You know what I mean?  On the thin elastic string.  Right, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's how they make edible panties.  How does that work out?  But some of those pieces of candy go up the bunghole. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, I know.  You don't eat the ones that go up the bunghole, do you?  Mm-mm.  Fucking shove them all in there.  The mystery round ones?  You can pull them out.  It gets in the Tootsie Roll factory.  Oh!  Hey, I don't remember Tootsie Rolls on this.  Let me just...  I lost my phones.  Not that it matters that much, but I was hoping for one of those books that these broads read,  and then they look at us like, you know, we're supposed to be the character in the book they're reading. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, we're pieces of shit over here.  Well, I am in certain books that they read.  Anyone know how to get the phones back?  Eric, get on the phones quickly.  I don't know what I'm doing here.  Why don't we eat and have someone in here that knows how to fucking fix them?  Yeah, whatever.  We'll eat, jerk each other off, fucking have a V8.  All right.  Terry Bradshaw's cursing.  Uh-huh.  Ohio University's doing a cover of The Fox, their marching band is.  Oh.  And this thing.  After the break, this thing. 
[00:55:30]  You mean our sponsor?  We have a new sponsor.  Nice.  Yes.  Very excited.  So, all right.  We should do something with our new sponsor now.  What the fuck is that?  It looks like Anne's eating a miscarriage for breakfast.  I don't know.  The yoke is on me.  What happened?  What is that?  And Paula Deen finally talking for the first time since, what, June or something?  Yes.  June.  She showed up at the NAACP with her middle fingers up.  This is Open Entity Show. 
[00:56:00]  Sirius XM.  The Open Entity Show continues.  Now we're talking.  Well, what is this for?  The fucking Sugar Hill Gang.  Yes.  Rapper's Delight.  I did a show with Wonder Mike once.  We did the Mark Maron.  I think we did Nevermind the Buzzcocks together. 
[00:56:30]  It was myself, him.  Wow.  Coolio and the girl who sang Take My Breath Away.  Berlin.  Berlin, yeah.  I always forget her name.  And I met Coolio years later and he had no memory of me whatsoever.  Jimmy.  That'll happen.  Fuck him.  I'd love to.  Oh.  44 years ago to date.  44?  They ever have another hit?  I always forget.  This was it for them?  This is 44 years old?  Yeah, it is. 
[00:57:00]  Of course it is.  Wow.  This is an old fucking song.  Turn this up.  See, I'm six foot one and I'm tons of fun and I guess you're a D.  You see, I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali and I just...  Wait, that's real old.  This is definitely 44 years ago.  What year?  That would be...  Oh, wait.  Maybe it's not 44.  That would be 69.  Yeah.  This didn't come out in 69.  Okay.  Wow.  All right.  There's got to be...  Yeah, all right. 
[00:57:30]  Uh-oh.  Who fucked up?  There's no way this is 44 years old.  You're right.  34?  79.  79.  34 years ago.  We're off by 10 years.  Who wrote this up?  Trevisimo.  Dope.  Oh, boy.  No math doing dope.  Who's up on get a fly girl?  Gonna get some spring and drive off in a depth OJ.  Everybody.  Yeah.  Everybody.  Because the Bob Newhart show premiered 41 years ago.  Oh.  So I guess three years before that was the Sugar Hill Gang.  This is a theme song. 
[00:58:00]  It's on you.  So what you gonna do?  What you gonna do?  What do they have other songs or no?  Nothing.  Nothing that the white boys do.  No.  I've seen anything really in here.  This was big.  I'm sure they had a few more hits for the community.  Maybe, yeah.  But not for radio listeners.  Mm-hmm.  Din, din, din, din, din, din, din, din, din.  Huh?  They did Apache.  What?  What?  What's that?  Isn't that...  Huh?  Look that up, Eric.  What? 
[00:58:30]  What?  Huh?  I think Apache's on the face.  What?  Apache?  Apache.  You sure about that?  Yeah, this is huge.  Look at it.  Oh, this is that jump on it?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  This is big.  Ho!  Ho!  Ho!  Ho!  No, I don't know it.  I don't know it either.  I ain't feeling it, yo.  Oh, I know this.  Oh, I'm thinking of jam on it. 
[00:59:00]  No.  You're a zombie.  Jump on it.  Jump on it.  Jump on it.  I don't know this.  Yeah, this is big.  And then Fresh Prince of Bel-Air made it big again.  Oh, okay.  See, you know it from that.  Three.  I sort of know this song.  It was big.  What's not?  Ah, it stinks.  I don't remember hearing this on the radio.  Ho!  Ho!  Ho!  Ho! 
[00:59:30]  Ho!  Ho!  Ho!  Ho!  Ho!  Ho!  Oh, God.  This is offensive.  Wow.  All right, it's Rapper's Delight again.  It's just a sideways version like we talk about.  Yeah.  My tribe went down in the whole of fame, cause I'm the one who shot Jesse James.  Oh, yeah.  But you know how innocent rap was back then?  Oh, yeah.  I like to rap and wear my sneakers.  I like to go to school and eat my lunch.  You know, it was all fun shit.  You know, don't diss me or I'll take your apple. 
[01:00:00]  You know, they'll take your dad.  Nothing dangerous here.  Yeah.  Better now.  I mean, you know.  Oh.  Jump on it.  Dun, dun, dun.  I don't know.  I'm not feeling it.  I'm backseat.  Jump on it.  Jump on it.  I don't really remember this.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Ooga, ooga.  Ooga, ooga, ooga.  That's all I'm feeling.  It was racism.  I like you or zombie.  Of course it's me.  Oh.  He's all smooth. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  Rap was so stupid.  All right.  Enough of this shit.  Well, they're finally saying something we said right when it happened.  Oh, I know.  Sources say New Jersey boardwalk fire is suspicious.  Of course it is.  Yes.  It's a coincidence that the place that gets destroyed by pretty much a hurricane, a super storm,  a year later gets decimated by a fire.  Right after the season.  Right.  Right after the season.  Yeah, yeah.  Of course it was set on purpose. 
[01:01:00]  You're right.  It was like three days after Labor Day.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  We got some money out of it.  Now let's burn it down.  No, what happened was, you know, the businesses down there are in a horrible spot.  Yeah.  One business decided to give it a shot and went, holy fuck, I'm not going to be able to make  it.  Yep.  So they lit the old match-o-roo.  Had no intention on burning 10 blocks.  No, of course not.  Exactly.  Well, then the wind kicks up and, you know, the rest is history, but there's somebody down  there that had a bad season. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, some fucking t-shirt shack.  Who knows?  Well, they're saying it started at the custard shop.  Right underneath, they said.  Right underneath the custard shop.  Yeah, yeah.  What do you mean?  Shouldn't you have the custard shop underneath?  I think it's, you know, like up on the boardwalk thing, so it's elevated.  Oh, under the boardwalk, basically?  And underneath, they said they saw it coming up through the slats and stuff.  Ah, you think it's custard guy?  I don't think so.  See, it's probably just fucking...  I'm just saying, if I had a business, right, and I want to take it out for the insurance 
[01:02:00]  money, you can't take out your business.  That's way too suspicious.  You take out the guy next to you.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  It takes out.  And then let him get all the heat.  But Opie tried to burn it down.  He had to be corrected.  So I don't know if it's the custard guy.  No.  I'm going with the waffle guy.  Yeah.  I'm going to say, officially, it was...  No.  It's probably some dude with a balloon store that made no money.  Right.  Because his balloons are no good.  Yeah, it probably was.  Look, I made his Muhammad Atta balloon. 
[01:02:30]  I thought it would be interesting.  I think I'm going to have to rework that song, too.  We're Stronger Than the Storm and the Fire.  We're Stronger Than the Fire.  Stronger Than the Storm and the Fire.  Stronger Than the Flaming Hail and fucking frogs and locusts.  Right.  And the fire.  There'll be some shoe warning, though, in that song.  Wait, is that a Billy Joel song they reworked?  No.  No.  We're Stronger Than the Storm was the big fucking song they all made down there.  Yeah.  It was like their We Are the World.  I think Governor Christie basically telling the world that, you know, the people in New Jersey 
[01:03:00]  are just the greatest people ever.  And that's why it'll be okay in the end.  But I think humans in general, you know, step up when they have to.  What else are you going to do?  I'm so sick of hearing that this particular community...  Oh, it's always that, right?  No, we're all like that.  But if you know this area, you know that we can pull together and get...  Oh, no.  We're going to show them what New Jerseyans are made of.  Right, right.  No.  Same shit as Ohioans.  Of course.  Everyone else that goes through this shit, they fucking...  When you go through some shit, you realize as a human being, you've got to step up and 
[01:03:30]  try to figure it all out.  Yeah.  What?  There's places out there that just fold?  They disappeared?  Right.  They had fucking...  I hate that shit.  They had a fire and just left.  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  We're just not strong enough.  Right.  And not together enough as a community to do this.  We're leaving.  Right.  Oh.  It's just horse shit.  You know, if there's one thing I learned about New Jersey...  Right.  They step up.  Right. 
[01:04:00]  I'm trying to think exactly what he said.  The people of New Jersey...  I don't know.  We're going to make the people of Indonesia look like pussies!  You think that would go over?  No.  No.  Not in Indonesia.  No.  Pretty sad, though.  Good for Jersey.  Pretty sad for that whole area.  That's fucked up.  It'll be fine.  But one guy down there didn't sell enough shit this past summer.  They'll be fine.  They'll rebuild and fucking have a big grand opening again next year.  Some shit.  Right. 
[01:04:30]  Wait, then they'll get some disaster relief or something.  Yeah, they'll get the low interest loans and stuff, right?  When they find out who did that, do you know how much trouble he's in?  Oh, is he in a Dutch?  You got Governor Christie right after?  I don't know if it's right.  I mean, you know, the gov.  They like calling him the gov.  Oh, do they?  The governor.  Yeah.  You don't need to know his name.  Governor.  He's just the governor now.  Governor.  Maybe a little highlight from his press conference, just talking about how Jersey people are just the greatest people on earth. 
[01:05:00]  And everyone else, if this happened to them, they would just fold because they don't have it in their DNA like people from New Jersey.  Yes, of course.  I guess you got to say some shit after something like this.  What are you going to say?  We'll pick up like everyone else would?  Yeah, yeah, like anyone else.  Challenges here are extraordinary.  I was up in Middletown before I came here.  Middletown?  And I met a little girl named Ginger.  Yay!  She's nine years old. 
[01:05:30]  Ginger.  And she lost her home.  Aw.  Her home is gone.  Oh, boy.  And, you know, I've hugged a lot of crying adults over the last week.  Yeah, they start crying when you hug them.  He's fat.  Sure, me too.  And she and her mom were there, and her dad, and this poor little girl just is scared.  Right.  And so it reminded me that for kids across New Jersey, the adults are here and we're in charge. 
[01:06:00]  And we're going to make sure, first and foremost, we keep you safe.  Aw.  And I know for the ones that are a little bit older, it's not cool to act scared even when you are scared.  That's right.  Smoke pot.  But even if you're just scared on the inside, and you're not going to show it on the outside,  believe me, the adults here in your government and in your communities care first and foremost about you.  This propaganda.  And keeping you safe, getting you back to school.  To make sure you feel like you're taken care of. 
[01:06:30]  And so let yourself be taken care of by the adults in your community.  We're going to be there for you.  Can I do that?  And there's no reason to avoid crying.  It's a sad situation.  And a lot of people have lost a lot.  And sorrow is part of what we're doing here.  But we can't allow that sorrow to replace our resilience.  Ah, resilience.  That's the word.  We're a tough group of people.  We will rebuild.  We will get better after all this. 
[01:07:00]  And we will be even tougher.  And man, America couldn't take New Jersey toughness before this.  After this, they're going to be hell on wheels.  Yeah, they could.  That's it.  That was it.  It was worth listening to all that crap about the kids and stuff.  Oh, God.  It's resilience.  That's the word I was looking for.  Boy, you know, you're not doing America like a Jersey.  And New Jerseyans are a tough bunch of people.  Everyone is a tough bunch of people when they have to be.  Yeah, what's happening right now in Boulder, Colorado?  Right, what are they just...  People just giving up.  They said, ah, fuck it, we're not tough enough. 
[01:07:30]  We don't have resilience over here.  Let's leave Boulder.  It's fucking flooding.  It's crazy over there.  The rain they're getting?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  People are getting, like, swept away.  Unbelievable.  But, you know, the state of Colorado is not tough.  It's not as tough as New Jersey.  So they're leaving.  They're absolutely going to fold.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  I just hate that stuff.  Such political...  I don't know what you're supposed to say, but...  That's just it.  What are you supposed to fucking say?  But when you're trying to make your people more special than everyone else, it's so silly. 
[01:08:00]  You sound like Putin now.  What?  Exceptionalism.  That's right.  You don't agree with New Jersey exceptionalism?  No.  Yeah.  If this happened...  If the fire happened in...  I don't know.  In most places, they would...  Right.  They would show their toughness, too, right?  Exactly.  Resilience.  That's the word.  Resilience, right.  A little resilience for you.  Mm-hmm.  Wow, look at that.  They're saying in Colorado that just the...  You know, it's not just mud and rocks on the roads.  It just took the roads away. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  Torrential fucking...  So it's not...  It's like rivers.  Right.  Over where the roads were.  And it's just taking chunks of pavement with it.  Just ripping it apart.  Yeah.  It's still raining.  Bunch of people missing.  I believe it was.  Yeah.  Unless it finally stops.  Meow.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's fucking crazy over there.  I was online last night just watching the greatest fucking thing ever.  My videos and...  Oh, Jimmy.  You ruined the surprise.  That's what I was going to say.  It was Stairway to Stardom. 
[01:09:00]  This was a show that was on cable access back in the late 70s, early 80s.  This fucking creepy guy ran it.  And it's so cheesy.  And it's all these New Yorkers.  It's like a talent show.  It's America's Got Talent for New York back in the 70s and 80s.  So incredibly bad.  Where is it?  Well, I tweeted a bunch of links. 
[01:09:30]  Any of the links I tweeted late last night, you have to see.  The comedians are my favorite.  And the impressionists are the greatest.  Let's see.  That guy...  Oh, we need some volume.  Yeah.  I need to see it.  Is this the one you want to see, though?  Because Sam's like he's watching TV at home with his feet up.  That guy runs the show.  The guy on the right.  Yeah.  He looks like he touches kids.  Oh, this is a dancer.  Don't go to the dancer yet.  I mean, we've got to get some audio more than visual. 
[01:10:00]  So go down to this guy.  Is that it?  No, no, no.  Keep going.  One more.  Sorry.  It's okay.  Lauren McCall is fucking 90.  Try.  Jesus.  No.  This will be...  Fuck.  Oh, maybe that guy.  Yeah.  Go to that guy.  See what he's doing.  Let's bring out Wayne Rubin, everybody.  He's a comedian.  Thank you. 
[01:10:30]  You know this guy?  He's got some potted plant behind him.  Thank you.  As you know, every year, Jerry Lewis has a telethon for muscular dystrophy.  And, of course, it's a very worthwhile cause.  But what would happen if he had a telethon for dandruff?  I think we'd go something like this.  All right.  Here we are on our 24th hour for dandruff.  And so far, we have reached a total of a dollar.  A dollar in 24 hours?  I have here a letter from the President of the United States.  It says, Dear Jerry, good luck in your fight against dandruff.  What's the matter?  Reagan couldn't send a few dollars with the letter? 
[01:11:00]  And now from the Middle East, I'd like to bring out, here's Menachem Begin.  Menachem, come on out here.  Louie, Louie, where is he, Louie?  He ain't here.  Menachem couldn't be with us, so instead I'd like to bring out the voice of racing, Fred Caposella.  Thank you, Jerry.  The horses are on the track.  It is now post-time.  Chip loves it.  In this race, fat lady, 10 pounds over.  And it's cabbage by a head. 
[01:11:30]  Thank you, Fred.  And now, from Jackie Gleason's American Scene Magazine, here's Joe, the bartender, and Crazy  Guggenham.  Oh.  How you doing, Donahee?  Craze Shoy's in the back.  I'll call him out.  Hey, Craze.  Hi, Joe.  Hello, Mr. Donahee.  You like it, Chip?  He's a fucking guy himself.  Just look him.  I was hanging around the house.  I wasn't doing nothing.  Oh, this guy. 
[01:12:00]  Now, the voice of the late, great Nat King Cole singing the Christmas song.  My mother loved him.  And now he just sings the rest of the song.  Chestnuts roasting on an open fire.  This is stairway into stardom.  People may not realize this is all one guy doing all those things.  Oh, I know.  You might not realize it.  Otherwise known as Escalator to Obscurity.  Yes.  All right.  Enough of him.  Yeah, you're fucking jealous because he sounds like the people.  I know.  I am. 
[01:12:30]  He's a garbage.  Go to, uh, yeah, there's another impressionist.  I hope you can find him.  Oh, I think this guy is.  Oh, yeah.  Uh, it just gets better.  Oh, this guy rolls.  Yeah, maybe him.  Johnny Gallagher.  This guy is the greatest.  He has nothing.  I've seen this before.  You know, ladies and gentlemen, that Jerry Cooney and Larry's home fight was really something.  Larry's, Larry's home fight.  He's a little nervous.  If our politicians were in a fight game, it'd go something like this.  And now, Howard Cosell. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, good.  Well, good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  With me, the former president of the United States, Jimmy Carter.  Jimmy, you do look beat.  Oh, no.  Well, I'll afford every top contender, but I promise that I will be back next year, and  I will win with the help of my brother, Billy.  Thank you.  Okay, we take you now to Las Vegas, where we have Jack Nicholson with Ronnie Reagan. 
[01:13:30]  Jack.  This is going to be good.  How the hell are you?  How are you?  Oh, God.  Chip is loving it.  Okay, guys, good.  You never look so good.  Well, I'm just a rough, tough cream puff.  And you know, I'll meet him next time.  I'll meet Jimmy or Henry.  Now back.  Oh, my God.  With Henry Kissinger.  Henry.  He's amazing.  He's here at the studio. 
[01:14:00]  I want to tell you the truth.  They used to beat me up all the time.  Dick Nixon, all of them.  I want to fight everybody.  Okay, let's go with Rocky Balboa.  Oh, fuck yeah.  And Richard Nixon, Rocky.  What's the matter with you, huh?  You don't like my friend?  You think he can't fight?  How embarrassing is this?  This is so bad.  I could watch this guy for an hour.  Yes, last night I was just going through all these clips. 
[01:14:30]  He's doing his Richard Nixon.  My fellow Americans, let me make this perfectly clear.  Look at the drummer in the background.  He's like Norman Fell.  No laughs from the drummer.  He's just waiting for his very drum.  Cary Grant.  This is the worst backdrop ever.  Oh, yes, yes, yes.  Put up your hands.  Come on, fight me.  Fight me.  Oh, yes, yes.  Enough of the fight thing.  Alfred Hitchcock.  Oh, good.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:15:00]  He's bombing terribly.  Why don't you farts me up three o'clock?  Why, thank you.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  You've been a gracious audience.  Thank you.  Now he's so good.  It's like Carson.  When Carson pulled over a comic,  I asked the same one.  Can you do something that nobody else does?  Kill yourself.  You can?  Three voices that nobody has ever done on TV.  Okay, here's the mic.  Okay.  Roger Moore.  I say that, Daniel. 
[01:15:30]  How are you?  Nice to see you.  Hello.  This is James Bond.  Al Pacino.  It's not British.  Pacino.  No one does Al Pacino.  I want to see you get hurt, you know what I mean?  So if you want to listen to me, do what you want.  And Squiggy of Laverne and Shirley.  Hello.  This is Squigman and his friend Lenny.  And we come to Chicago to see Laverne.  What is that?  That gets the applause break.  You know, you make me look short.  You know that.  This guy's got charisma, the host, though. 
[01:16:00]  Holy shit.  Whatever happened to that guy?  His name's Johnny Gallagher.  I would love to know what happened to all these people.  I must have watched 20 or 25 clips from this show.  What?  Just the whole thing.  So bad.  That's a hard one to Google.  Johnny Gallagher's kind of a common name.  Yeah.  Try it.  Oh, there's the opener.  Play the opener of the show.  Oh, my God.  It's Prosser.  Play the...  Listen to their New York accent.  Stay tuned, because Stairway to Stardom is next, with Frank Massey. 
[01:16:30]  Here's the big opener.  It's some glittery fucking...  They got a song.  You know, you can put this show as is on a Don't Swim on Cartoon Network.  And it would work.  Yes.  We're here to brighten up your day.  Brighten up your day.  We've got singers and dancers and actors for bonding for you. 
[01:17:00]  Ventriloquism.  Listen to this song.  Oh, there we go.  We got the beards and the fucking...  We made the highlight reel.  On the street.  Oh, no, boo.  Let's stay with a Stardom.  Let's stay with Stardom.  Let's stay with Stardom.  We got the camera angles and the fades to try to make it look like a real variety show.  Did any of these people make it?  I haven't seen one person.  In the open, we've seen a lot of people we've never heard of before.  And the stage is so... 
[01:17:30]  With that backdrop, I'd rather do comedy in front of somebody that said Taweed and Jihad behind it.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  They pop his face up on it.  Yeah, it's a Stardom, a lot of clips online.  Yeah, that guy's rocking.  Here, let's see one more.  You got one more we should say?  Yeah, yeah, let's go back down.  Find one I tweeted that was a little lower than...  One more.  Lower?  Than that one. 
[01:18:00]  Just...  Better friend said she was hilarious?  Oh, yeah, this is another comic.  A comedian.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Guess what?  Anyway, I just came to New York recently.  You know her?  What's her name?  Excuse me.  Is that Fran Capo?  No, Cheryl Klein.  Cheryl Klein.  Don't know.  I don't know Cheryl Klein.  You should know her, man.  She's funny.  She might be Jewish.  Oh, okay.  Oh, I'll bet you she is a JKB.  My mother always said, Chipper, watch out for them.  They're going to take your money.  What?  My mother said, if you want to see how many Jewish people there are, roll a penny out, 
[01:18:30]  Chipper, they'll run for it and clunk their heads.  You should be on this show.  I'm not originally from New York.  I came here like a lot of you people looking out there.  A lot of you cesareans.  To make it big in show business, I gave myself three weeks.  I have two hours left.  Two?  No.  An hour and four minutes.  Anyway, no, I'm going to make it fine.  If I don't make it here, honey, I'll go back to visit my mother in Miami because I got  a letter from my father, a telegram yesterday.  Come to Miami.  I said, Daddy, I'm not coming to Miami.  She drives me nuts. 
[01:19:00]  He said, Cheryl, your mother went to a change of life.  She's going to start living hers instead of mine.  Laugh it up, guys!  Oh, listen.  Now, listen.  My mother, well, maybe you know her.  She's the queen of denial.  The love goddess of King's Highway.  God bless this lady.  But she identifies with major characters of the Bible.  Like last Thursday, she had a Moses complex.  You know how Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt?  My mother had a similar experience.  She led our family circle out of an A&S white sale.  I said, Ma, I have no room for the she.  She said, where am I? 
[01:19:30]  I said, I look like the cold clock's crying.  She said, where the she?  Just not about her.  Break your head.  Daddy, leave me alone.  Tell her to leave me alone.  Cheryl, don't call your mother she.  This is the story of my life.  I go to Miami.  She's happy.  She's living in a condominium.  Maybe you've heard of it.  Yenta Towers.  She makes a face.  So I'm trying to tell my friends where I'm going.  She's sitting on a golden room.  She says, have a little schnapps.  I said, Ma, what are you schnappzing me?  She said, sit down and join in the activity.  I said, what's the activity?  Sitting down and watching Gidget Coast Kosher on a purple velveteen couch, you know? 
[01:20:00]  Good microphone show.  Unbelievable.  She has a pull in the shape of her mouth.  The lifeguard can't swim.  They're paying to listen.  My daughter, she moved out of the house.  She calls.  So she calls twice a day.  Big deal.  That's right.  Unbelievable.  My mother used to sing me a lullaby.  It went something like this.  Go to sleep, my flesh and blood.  Go to sleep, my chubby child.  I'll stay up for a while.  To work my fingers to the bone. 
[01:20:30]  To give you and your son of a...  Your fat and great brother Larry a nice home.  Oh, she's great.  Oh, she's great.  How fucking horrid.  That's all I want to do is watch this.  I love it.  Find one more underneath that one on my...  She said son instead of brother.  She fucked everything up.  Oh, she's nervous on the big show.  Oh, God.  I wonder where this was shot.  Yes, somewhere in the city. 
[01:21:00]  Early 80s.  Oh, this guy.  It's a singing act.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I hate the way this guy says cabaret.  He's singing cabaret.  Fine, singer.  Let's bring him out.  Jimmy Swatsman, right?  There he is.  Jimmy Swatsman.  At least the hostess style.  Yeah, he's good.  It's like Steinfeld.  Wait, this is real?  Oh, yeah.  This is serious.  Look at him.  He's all dramatic. 
[01:21:30]  Come hear the music play.  Come to the cabaret.  Come to the cabaret.  Look at the cuts.  The guy's fingers on the piano.  Yeah.  Come hear the music.  Play.  Come to the cabaret.  Yeah.  I can't figure it out.  I was fixated on this. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, what a toothy ass.  Come to the wine.  Come to the band.  Come blow your horn.  Start celebrating right this way.  Your table's waiting.  Uh-oh.  Bring it down.  Where's the camera going?  Oh, man.  A double shot in his rosace.  She's like every smile away.  This is so bad.  Come to the cabaret, old chum. 
[01:22:30]  He has the dumb and dumber chip tooth.  What's that?  Like a cabaret, old chum.  To the dumb and dumber.  Come to the cabaret.  I could not stop watching these last night.  What about the magic act?  Oh, there is a magician.  Yeah.  Yes, a magician.  He's a little awkward.  I don't think that's him from the show, though. 
[01:23:00]  There's another one of Jimmy Schwartzman.  That's him again?  Wait, he got two songs on the show.  Why wouldn't he?  All right.  Put them on.  Two appearances, because he's dressed differently.  Jimmy Schwartzman, everybody.  Schwartz.  Schwartzman.  Give me a shot.  This is delightful.  I like this guy.  Wow.  Wow.  Nice shirt.  It's a little more like a star this guy.  Blind guy in the back of the horn.  There is a brotherhood of man, a devil in brotherhood of man, a noble tithe of life, all human hearts and minds. 
[01:23:30]  He touches his head like minds.  He, uh-oh, they're going for the split screen.  And there it is.  You can tell the camera goes way over to one side.  Your lifelong membership is free.  Wow.  He keeps turning to the side.  I think Bartlett sang this song in How to Succeed. 
[01:24:00]  Did he?  This is from How to Succeed.  Oh.  He did much, much better than he would have.  I saw.  I was like, the setting was much more appropriate.  Brotherhood of man.  Man.  God, boy.  Guy has great teeth.  Does he have a sore on his lips?  He's got a sore on his lips.  He's got a sore on his lips.  It looks like he does.  He appears to.  He probably was nervous in the dressing room.  He had an outbreak. 
[01:24:30]  There's hundreds of people watching.  There's a big coat sore on his lips.  Holy shit.  He has his brightest shirt with the biggest collar.  Oh my God.  We've got to use that mic next.  He's got a giant coat.  And the band behind him couldn't look more like dead people.  The trumpet player is, like, relaxing against the wall.  He's just chilling out. 
[01:25:00]  My mind.  A smattering of applause.  This is no PFG TV.  No, no, it's not.  What's his name?  Let's Google him.  By the way, we've got to get Scorch on the show, man.  He lost his day.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We've got to talk to the Scorch.  Let's Google that singer.  I want to know where he is.  Where Jimmy Schwartz.  Jimmy Schwartzman.  Schwartzman.  It's in 1982, that one was.  Schwartzman.  Wow.  That's 30 years ago.  31 years ago.  He's probably running fucking the Schwartzman law firm. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  Schwartzman fucking.  Yeah.  What?  This is from 2006.  No way.  He's still doing it.  No way.  Come on.  Jimmy Schwartzman is here?  That's him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where did they fucking find him?  Handheld.  It's amazing. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  I got to get him on the show.  That's him, all right.  He's getting up to sing.  Oh my god, they fucking... 2006.  Yeah! 
[01:26:30]  I hope he says it the same way.  It's him! I'm so glad he didn't die in 9-11.  Yeah, that would have been terrible.  He's not that bad.  2006, he's back.  He's not as bad.  He doesn't seem to be full of that youthful exuberance anymore.  He's been beaten down by life.  He thought he was going to be a fucking singer. 
[01:27:00]  A Broadway star.  Beaten down.  Yeah, well.  Go listen to our old tapes.  He's the assistant to the assistant manager of the movie theater.  Wow.  Cabaret.  Is there any more?  Come to the cab!  Is that him in the middle?  That's him.  That's him.  I guess they did some kind of reunion thing.  Oh, man.  What, Stairway to Stardom Reunion?  Yeah.  Stairway to Stardom Reunion.  Wow.  That's fucking great.  Go back to the original Stairway to Stardom. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, where's...  Maybe we can find one you haven't watched yet.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know there's some more singing and dancing.  Let's see what's down below.  That's wonderful.  What do we got?  What's our choices here?  Oh, another comedian.  Oh!  Yeah, let's go comedian.  That's the guy down there in the middle.  Yeah, that guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don Costello.  Don Costello.  Don Costello, I know.  You know Don Costello?  Where's he?  This is an interview. 
[01:28:00]  Interview?  Well, maybe it's not a real interview.  But I'm sure he does a few jokes.  I think we should...  Who is she?  Don Costello.  I really do.  You mean on the level?  On the level.  We haven't done it.  People want to know about him.  Okay, Don.  Full screen, please?  Come on, Don.  Why don't you get here right in between us here?  You don't mind stepping out of character, do you?  No.  You know, we've known Don for several years now, and just recently we found out that he's  been making movies and everything. 
[01:28:30]  Really?  Tell us, you're really modest.  Tell us a little about yourself, Don.  Well, I was in Guys and Dolls.  I played Harry the Horse, the Gangster, and the Poor Soul, and the Bari Mission.  Then I was in Stuck on You, the first turn-on.  He looks familiar.  The Toxic Avenger, which is playing now.  Yes.  And I played in The Intoxicator Butler in the first turn-on, which I just mentioned.  And I had a lot of fun doing it, because I love to make people laugh, and if I see a  smile on their face, it makes me happy. 
[01:29:00]  Fuck, yeah.  I hope to do that for many years.  What's with the backdrop?  There's more people like you, Don, in this world.  It'd be a better place to live in.  Don Costello.  Wow, that was a good interview.  He looked deeply depressed.  Yeah, yeah.  I wonder what ever happened to him.  Oh, here's a little duet.  A little duo.  Robert F. Amico and Sue Veneer.  God, not one name we know.  Nothing.  They never went on to anything.  Sue went on to a successful teeth-fixing business. 
[01:29:30]  Did she?  Yes.  Souvenir.  Souvenir, yes.  Either that or people would take her home to remember things by.  Yes, exactly.  Get it?  Souvenir.  All right.  Oh.  Ladies and gentlemen.  I have to keep on this.  I've heard this song.  Robert.  This is called I'm a Cunt.  Oh.  I'm a Cunt.  It's a wuss.  Oh.  That's Souvenir.  Zappa.  It's fucking me in the 80s. 
[01:30:00]  Right.  Terrific.  That looks like Frank Zappa.  Is that Zappa?  Yeah, it looks like Zappa.  You up to the mountains.  We made love till dawn.  Two bodies pressed together.  Yeah.  In total warmth.  Friends before.  Lovers after.  They're trying to.  So the story goes. 
[01:30:30]  I love you, babe.  What happened?  Who knows?  This is so bad.  I know.  I wonder how many people thought they said Juno's and got offended.  Now we're not together.  I miss those summer nights.  Massage your tensions away.  You said it felt right.  Was this supposed to be like a meatloaf song?  Like a paradise by the dashboard light?  Dead by one. 
[01:31:00]  Come on, admit it, babe.  It was fun.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  This is so incredibly bad.  The writing's amazing.  Yeah, it really is.  Oh, man.  Oh, he's rocking now.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:31:30]  I wonder where you are now.  Oh.  Don't see you no more.  The last time I spoke to you.  We were at war.  Hey.  With our friends.  With our love.  With your vision of the past.  The summer of 83 went fast.  The summer of 83 went fast.  That's it?  That's it.

[01:42:30]  in the family  like if we did something wrong  she'd hide in the kitchen  she'd put on  Jerry Cooney trunks  Jerry Cooney  a roof bathrobe  and a mouthpiece  and wait for us to come  in the kitchen  and she'd chase us  around the table  like when I get a hold of you  you're gonna wish you were dead  I used to run in my room  and lock the door  and she'd come up to the door  open the door  I'm not gonna hit you  I know you're gonna hit me mom  I know you're gonna hit me  open the door  I'm not gonna hit you 
[01:43:00]  and I waited for everything  to get very quiet  I opened the door  just to crack  she would put her hand through  like the Frankenstein monster  pull me by my hand  and give me a tour  of the house  holy shit  I will say  I've seen Richie have better shows  I've seen him have much better shows  the city was doing a lot of things  this past couple of weeks 
[01:43:30]  remember they celebrated  the 50th anniversary  of the movie King Kong  one day I'm looking up  I've seen King Kong  on the building  the next day I come back  I see this big brown thing  stuck on the side  it's like they climbed up  took a dump  and left  what are they gonna do  what are they gonna do  oh kidsy  what are they gonna do  for the 50th anniversary  of D-throat  have a giant mouth  going up and down  the building  craziness  and  craziness 
[01:44:00]  craziness  craziness  holy shit  this is so bad  no one's looking  at each other  here in the room  it's just  well Timmy knows the guys  oh yeah yeah  we're all just gonna peek  in a gym  I wonder if it's okay  I'm sure Rich would not  have positive things  to say about this  no it's one of those  you know  early on things  that suck  when you look back  what year did King Kong  come out  because I want to see  what year this was  39  38  39  this happened in 82 
[01:44:30]  oh 82  wow  so 50  wait a minute  he was probably new  in comedy then  because I knew him  in the early 90s  of course  it would be  89 would be  the 50th anniversary  if it was that  maybe his  comedy wasn't  factually correct  I remember when  they put the King Kong  on the outside  of the Empire State Building  yeah it was a big  blow up King Kong  and it lasted  for like a couple  of hours  and then it just  deflated  why  I guess the wind  fucked it up  they just didn't  have it figured out  yeah yeah  alright 
[01:45:00]  well there you go  stairway to stardom  yeah  there's a million of them  we should keep going  there are a million of them  it's fucking fantastic  it's the best fucking  viewing you'll have  yeah  82  wow  I googled  Richie Triola  and it's just coming up  stairway to stardom  there's no way  you could be happy  if the one  that's it huh  yeah  oh my god  that's pretty bad  do do do do  I  I  I  I  was so fucking 
[01:45:30]  taken by that  last night  do do do do do  oh  that's what you got  if there's an  Opie and Anthony  TV show  you need to put on  like an old school  fringe inducing  public access show  public access variety  show type thing  how great would that be  fantastic  very good  I've already twittered  texted myself  I might have to  do it  yeah  rethink  to do what  segment on the compound 
[01:46:00]  yeah just to do an old school  public access show  but then every now and then  bring on like a really awesome  good  someone awesome  like  like it's just like  bad act bad act  then Louis C.K.  stops by or something  you know it's fucked up though  this is the  this was the only place  a person  there was no fucking YouTube  right  you didn't have your own podcast  and channels and shit  this you did  videos  no  these weren't popular  no  so you were  you were relegated  to public access television  that was gonna make  you a star  that was your 
[01:46:30]  stairway to startup  because  there was no other recourse  for these people  they fucking  you wanna be on TV  that's it  I actually liked  Richie's joke about  the fucking  50th deep third anniversary  a giant mouth on top  of the Empire State Building  sucking the Empire State Building  like it's a giant cock  yeah but then he just  patted a bell  and he went  craziness  craziness  craziness  craziness  with that we're gonna  take a break  and when we get back  we're gonna introduce  a brand new sponsor  to the O.P. and Anthony Show  oh yeah  see 
[01:47:00]  told you we had sponsors  and now back to  the O.P. and Anthony Show  and now back to  the O.P. and Anthony Show  on SiriusXM  na na na na na na na na  we got a big boy meeting  today by the way  oh yeah  our first big boy meeting  yes  yes  very excited  very excited to meet  with Tim Sabian today  excited  yes we're very excited  to give him the lay  of the lawn  wow 
[01:47:30]  he has finally settled in  and he's taking over  the channel  transition's over  I don't know  I guess  we haven't seen anyone  from the original team  since the word came down  that Tim Sabian would be  taking over responsibility  I remember the last words  to Gary were  what the fuck  because he wouldn't tell us  that this was going down  even though we already knew  yeah  and I'm like  why don't you just tell us  he goes  no just go down to  Scott's office  it's good  it's good news  and that was it  we've never seen him again 
[01:48:00]  is he in his office  Gary  why would he be here  I think he is  oh  is our show  still on in his office  there's no fucking way  Travis check if our show  is on in his office  there's no fucking way  he's listening to us  he's listening to our show  anymore  he is so over us  he turned that off  in a second  which I told him  proves he never really  wanted the gig either  we didn't want him  he didn't want us  he turned it off  there's no fucking way  that he's listening 
[01:48:30]  to our show right now  how come we can't get him  in the studio  what's Hannity doing  on the morning show  what's good Hannity  he's right across the street  oh no he's boxing  with the other guys  oh my god  this is like  the  you watch that show  The Newsroom  yeah  yeah yeah yeah  Dave Brick  I don't think  I think Obie's lying  I've seen it  I don't watch it  but I've seen it  The Newsroom  I think it's pretty  I've seen The Newsroom  but they did that  exact thing  it's got that guy in it  they had Jeff Daniels  come in  to do the morning show  to soften his image 
[01:49:00]  and they made him  wear a football helmet  and throw footballs  and he felt humiliated  of course he did  and now like two weeks later  Hannity's going on  the Fox News morning show  and boxing  doing box dancing  that's why The Newsroom  is a good damn  good show  it is a good show  there are some  they're mocking the media  there are some great clips  Travis is coming back  thumbs up or down  can you say  go look down the hall  there we go  oh boy  it's going to take him forever 
[01:49:30]  yes or no  oh where'd he go  no  he went to check to see  if Gary listens to our show  what do you think  why would he  yeah there's no way  he'd be listening to our show  you think a couple weeks ago  the minute after he left  the meeting with you guys  like right after Labor Day  yeah  he goes  alright well no I'm done  oh he deleted us  from his preset  yeah that's it  yeah yeah  there's no doubt in my mind  now it's you know  and I don't need Jimmy  for this one  I don't blame him  okay  I don't need Jimmy  to show me  show me what's up 
[01:50:00]  on this one  Jimmy has a beautiful way  of showing us  what's up sometimes  but not on this one  some of the things  that were said  right  why wouldn't he want  to hear himself  call the fucking  incompetent egg  on a daily basis  who wouldn't want  to hear that  come in from work  having their coffee  and bagel  hey loser  you have no skill set  what  I haven't had  my first sip  of coffee yet  Travis said  it's playing  on Rob's side  of the room  because Rob  still listens  Rob listens 
[01:50:30]  but he said  he's not hearing  anything coming  from the Gary side  of the room  nothing from Gary  maybe they're both  hearing from  one radio  maybe  I doubt it  Gary can hear  he's got ears  well  obviously  you can see  on his head  prominently  displayed ears  jeez  man  so big  what do my  headphones keep  like  I don't know  are your headphones  yeah  believe it or not  I'm trying not  to complain every day  there's plenty to  complain about 
[01:51:00]  every single day  the volume  just goes down  it sounded horrible  as soon as we  started the show  but I figured  fuck it  no it sounds  okay  but now  it keeps going  down and then  back up again  down up  you alright  yeah  yeah  cause I could  turn  I could turn  them up  sounds like  something for the  big boy meeting  now it's  now it's back  down for the  big boy meeting  like that fucking  garbage pile  yeah  that's what we  come into on  Monday  there's a landfill  in the corner  of the studio  you tweeted  right Jimmy  yeah  I told Anne  I fully expect  a rat to start 
[01:51:30]  climbing up the  side of this  garbage pile  that's  overflowing  with goodness  it's disgusting  it's fucking  disgusting  there's a pile  of fucking  garbage  coming out  of there  yeah  there should  be cocky  roaches  flying out  of there  I've been told  we have a new  sponsor  oh right  it's a big deal  when we get a new  sponsor  now you might have  heard this sponsor  on our show  before but  right  but they're  sponsoring something  you know how  events get  sponsored

[01:59:30]  no  yes  Steve Platter  no  oh this guy  let's see  oh that guy  long time ago  you can say his name  Hugh  nah  he didn't like  when we disrupted  things  I don't like him  I didn't like him  you don't like him  no  terrible guy  he was a douche  he was a douche  he was no fun  yes  dumpster breath  none fun  none fun  fuck him  yeah  fuck him 
[02:00:00]  I'm glad  that's all  so this meeting  after the show  though  that's like  what  first meeting  in  I don't know  like four years  for us  he's exhausting  to meet with  Tim  he talks  a lot of energy  he's like  yeah  oh my god  what's he saying  oh my god  oh it'll be good  believe me  he reads a lot  of motivational books  I bet he does  right  right  self-help  motivation  yes  how to motivate  the troops  he wrote one 
[02:00:30]  it was called  how to talk a lot  while people are dozing  I'm a man  I didn't bring  my fucking list in  I told Tim  I was gonna make  the list  and I was  did you check it  twice  I certainly did  I made a list  of who's naughty  and nice  oh  good for you  I certainly did  good improv by me  just saying the song  yes  but you have a list  of things  that what  ideas  that this show  needs  not necessarily  creative ideas  but things  the show  needs  three new hosts  that's right  and new signage 
[02:01:00]  and fucking  less TVs  we have  nine TVs  no  we like  our TVs  take these  three fucking  shit TVs  put them in  the corner  by the window  and fuck it  you don't need  that's a whole  waste of space  yes  it's pointing  towards Sam's chair  they should be  in the fucking  corner there  and this dumb couch  you can use all this  it's too many  you don't need  six TVs  those three  should be gone  we're not getting  rid of our TVs  no you shouldn't  get rid of them 
[02:01:30]  but you don't need  six  we need all six  it's a waste of  space  we actually have  eight  you know why  we made the  announcements when  we got to  series  but here's the  reason why  we're triangulated  here  we all have our  TVs that are in  our line  like I say  oh get rid of  those  but those are  the ones  Opie looks at  Opie can look at  those  and then I look  at these  I want to look  at those  we're just losing  space though  and then if I  look at Opie  I can look at  these  right  yeah  those are yours  those are  which ones are  yours  I don't even  like the TVs  being on  these are yours  I don't care  about them  all right  we'll take 
[02:02:00]  those two out  take them  they're distracting  oh I like  the TVs  I think we  should maybe  have one up  there where  they're doing  the thing  about Kong  and then we  can show  these two  right here  and maybe  we can have  oh boy  yeah and then  a couple over  there  can't explain  all of it  unfortunately  I do think  that we  should have  maybe have  them high  up like  that  have one  there  one there  like  what do we  need  fucking  what do we  need  we're showing 
[02:02:30]  CNN and Fox  like the same  shit  and MSNBC  on the bottom  who needs  those  it's too much  god  I'm amazed  with this ship  what's that  what's that  yeah they're  trying to  right that ship  that tipped  over what  like two years  ago  where was that  where was that  again  Italy  that's right  Italy  and they're  going to try  to write it  with like  they got a  bunch of  weights on  one side  he's a B  for burden  who's that  some old guy

[02:04:30]  little problem  out there  what's the  prob  right here  and then  when we  do  the Seattle  San Fran  that really  was live  yeah  what was  it came in  during the  commercial break  right  Terry Bradshaw  oh  but they didn't  know they were  live  it wasn't  their fault  I guess not  no  yeah so  whatever  that was  well everyone  knows Terry  Bradshaw 
[02:05:00]  is a bit  of a you  know  cock  he's a loose  cannon  right  bit of a loose  cannon  possibly a cock  I don't know  for sure  I don't know  I was asking  the question  I don't know  yeah  see him in  those fucking  Burt Reynolds  movies  oh my god  that's 80 years  ago  I know  he still looked  exactly the same  he went bald  at like 12  ah whatever  we're a little  live  yeah when you  hear the fuck  on the  on the tape  it gets  everyone's  attention 
[02:05:30]  Fox Sports  has issued  an apology  to everybody  no  they apologized  to first of all  it was cable  and they apologized  to Bradshaw too  because he didn't  know he was live  it wasn't his fault  well yeah  you owe him  an apology  because you  fucked him over  but  ah  you gotta watch  those fucking  hot mic  you know  you hear from  Denny all the time  yeah you do  oh you want  hot mic  hot mic  you want Denny  in here  to explain  the hot mic  why would I  want that  I'd better have  fucking lava  pour through  the ceiling  well he could  he could explain  the hot mic thing  I think 
[02:06:00]  that it happens  sometimes  I think  we're good for a while  we know about that  yeah the hot mic  we're good for a while  you sure  I think  always assume  always assume  the mic is live  absolutely  always make that  assumption  that's what you gotta  although you know  we do slip up in here  every so often  sometimes you know  what they say  when you assume things  make an ass  that was not it  oh what was it  things could go awry  oh it doesn't make  any sense  it does  no it doesn't  you want to tell  Denny to get back  into his cubicle  because  oh 
[02:06:30]  he's starting to walk  down the hall  they're talking about  lock the fucking door  what  should I let him  know to go  no he's  he was peaking  but I think  he went back  he was peering  he had that look  of hope on his eyes  fucking gay  fucking guy  I like Denny  I love the Denny  it's always entertaining  sometimes  the hard drive of hits  sometimes on Sunday  you could hear him  I swear  I've never heard  his voice on  SiriusXM  unless he's on our show  if you hear a voice  that doesn't really sound 
[02:07:00]  like a professional radio voice  it's him  a little weak  yeah  a little weak  yeah he's a fucking  weak voice  he had a stronger voice  he would have gone  really far  he would have been  a superstar  would have been  a boss jock  a lot of enthusiasm  but a little weak  in the voice part  a little weak  got the heart  but not the pipes  yep  Denny  that's what happens  ooh Denny  I don't know  that's amazing  they're just  they're gonna pull  this fucking ship  ship  not ship  over  yeah get a few guys 
[02:07:30]  I could have done that  forget it's been  sitting there  for fucking years  why don't they  why don't you  just leave it there  do you know  how much money  that must cost  yeah  they're gonna  they're gonna  spend a lot of money  just to salvage it  to raise it  right  I think a half a billion  dollars they said  to what  500 million  to write it  yeah I guess  SiriusXM's doing it  are you serious  yeah  why would you leave it there  as like a tourist attraction  well I think  maybe eventually  give tours on it  people don't like  the idea of a grave  being a tourist attraction 
[02:08:00]  oh right  I think the families  of the dead  might have something  to say  how many  not too many  all right  it's like the Andrea Doria  you can almost pull it off  as a tourist attraction  not too many people  well that's how they're  gonna try to write it  how  they got some kind  of grid system  they built underwater  weights with a big  hingey thing  people are amazing  when they really  you know  and they're gonna float  it up  have to do something  yeah and then they're  gonna put big floats  on the sides  Jesus Christ  a giant float  got a bunch of  divers under there  I would just go around 
[02:08:30]  and like  I would sit in the  dining room  with my diving thing on  have a little tea party  with my friends  I'd go in there  and steal everybody's stuff  that you could do too  yeah  have they done that yet  but that's serious  if you do that  there's already a bunch  of barnacles  and everything on it  are there any bodies  in there  I don't know  if there was anyone  that was missing  was there  was there someone  unaccounted for  I would assume  he's dead  they've had two years  to kind of take  a look around  I'm sure it's gone  well you know what it is  they can't pull  towards the way it fell  because if they pull 
[02:09:00]  towards the water  it's gonna flip upside down  to pull like  to make the bottom  right itself  they'd have to be on land  there's no way to do it  you have to get like  two million cars  or something  and all that water  what the fuck  are they gonna do  and all that water  is in there  as you try to  yeah  they have to get  right the ship  they're gonna bail it out  yeah well that's why  they're gonna use  the big floaties  on either side  the boat's not really  gonna float  under its own buoyancy  they have the  holy  the big floats  on the side  fastened to it  when are they gonna do it  take it wherever they need to  they're doing it right now 
[02:09:30]  oh is it now happening  yes  slowly but surely  probably goes real slow  yeah  no I think it's happening  live right now  wow  amazing  it's a big pain  in the foot  and who do you call  for that job  Ghostbusters  oh  I thought so  no there's actually  a company out there  called  Ship on the Shore  Riders  Riders  as in like  writing a wall  I know what you meant  I think  Ted has a company  he's just been waiting  for this opportunity  for many  I certainly do  it's called 
[02:10:00]  Raise Your Boat  yours spelled  Y-E-R  raise  raise  raise  your boat  gently tipped over  in the sea  not so merrily  merrily  merrily  there's dead  passengers under there  well how do you  raise the boat  there Ted  we have a toothpick  system Gregory  we send divers  down with toothpicks  yeah  yes  they continually  pile them  with little flat  paper plates on there  until it reaches  where the ship is  and then we all 
[02:10:30]  push  that doesn't sound  very  but it's economical  yeah  sounds like you  would use a lot  of toothpicks  we also have one  where you place  a nuclear weapon  under one side  and you blast it  until it shoots  up in the sky  hopefully lands  right side up  hopefully  that's like a last  resort I would guess  a nuclear device  Jesus  Paula Deen  talked for the  first time 
[02:11:00]  yeah  we gotta hear more  bullshit out of her  mouth  public appearance  what I mean by the  bullshit is the  fact that she has  to now make believe  she learned a lot  from her experience  shut up  the fucked up part  of the whole thing  is she was being  sued  for this racial  discrimination  and things that  she said  and everything  and she actually  they found her  whatever they find  in a civil suit  not guilty  acquitted  of whatever  the fuck it is  but she was  she didn't have 
[02:11:30]  to pay anything  right  because they deemed  her she didn't  do anything wrong  right  but she still  got fucked  for what she said  during the trial  right  fucked up her  which is ridiculous  fucked up her  whole empire  right  yes  what's up  with the old  guy in boston  I don't know  you use a phrase  thrill of a lifetime  that just says it all  it doesn't come any  bigger than this  how about that  the good stuff  doesn't end there  by the way  alan's daughter says 
[02:12:00]  there was extra money  raised that they  didn't need for the  trip  they donated it  to the jimmy fund  for cancer  research  that is one cool  dude  right  and what a beautiful  way  you see that  they moved her  to the side  what a behemoth  she's a big woman  that's a big bitch  although I like a big  fat pig on tv  I respect the fact  that they're not  all good looking people  we have some breaking  news to bring you  their possible  shooting incident  at washington's  navy yard  we love the details  we love the details  after the commercials  we're going to sell  a little advertising 
[02:12:30]  and tell you about  the potential murders  what do they got  mama mancini meatballs  is that their sponsor  right  so the paula dean lady  did a little talking  over the weekend  uh huh  yeah she was at a  cooking and entertaining  convention  of course  where else would she be  paid gig  so I guess what  I would think so  she figures I'll take  three months off  people will chill the  fuck out  then I come back  I say I learn some shit  and then I can move on  she got a standing ovation 
[02:13:00]  I think what she came out  to  yeah cause she's got  her fans man  supporting the hell  out of her  good  this is my first time  out in three months  oh my god  that doesn't even  sound like a real voice  it sounds like a  cartoon voice  stop blubbering  you slob  this is my first time  out  ain't three months  this is my first time  out in three months  good for her fans

[02:14:00]  she learned a lot  from her  experience  what did she  learn  how fucking  despicable  people are  how knee-jerk  reactionary  people are  sure  how fucking  hypocritical  and fucking  stupid  yeah  maybe that  maybe that is  what she learned  is there a  longer clip  I want to hear  what she learned  and you really  when you're accused  of being racist  and you have that  accent  wow is that a  tough one to  overcome  I love the  colored  hey good

[03:06:30]  the aristocrats  alright what else  we do everything today  I think so  those meatballs for real  holy fuck  they're pretty god damn good  I'd throw my plate away here  but this dumpster  pile it up there  in the corner  pile it up  and no one's  taking it out  or anything  there's garbage around  it's splattered on the floor  Tim's doing a great job so far  oh my god  by the way  do you know how badly  Gary would've gotten abused 
[03:07:00]  for that garbage can  if he was still in charge  oh my god  he'd've been killed  you know how quickly  Opie would've claimed  that Gary didn't have  the skill set  to take garbage  out of the studio  you know why  it's filled up right  why  cause he's not walking around  in the garbage pail anymore  who  Gary  why would he be walking around  in a garbage pail  cause he's garbage  oh  see  you were supposed to get it  without me explaining it  see that 
[03:07:30]  but it made it so much  more hurtful  a lot more hurtful  when you just said it  that was a lot more hurtful  let me see that  I was hoping it would take  a minute or two  for people to figure it out  but I had to explain it  that's not good  that is jam packed  with garbage  that's right  it's fucking just  there's no way  this studio  should have that  fucking garbage  well it's a high profile show  I mean that's  that's the way  high profile shows are run  you know  that's why  that's it  by the way  that cardboard box  is what  Laszlo had brought in  on Friday 
[03:08:00]  yeah  this is the way  a fucking  top flight operation  is run  top flight  this is it  I think you've got  an item to be added  to your list  yeah  not at all  this is the way  it should be  everybody's doing  their part  this is good  oh Christ  it's endless  with Twitter  let's take a leak  what now on Twitter  the dumb throwaway  Goya lines we had  this guy's all mad  going it's a billion  dollar business  didn't need to pay  anyone to find  their product  holy fuck 
[03:08:30]  are you really  a white knife  for Goya  dummy  he's upset  that you made  fun of Goya  I say that Goya  yeah because their  food is always  at the bottom  shelves of the supermarket  oh and it's a guy  I just recently  started following  well you just  fucking  now you ruined it  Goya are my  neighbors  worth almost a  billion  they are not  worried of the  lower shelf  google their  mansion  I didn't think  Goya's Larry Stark  I didn't think  Goya  I don't like  meatballs 
[03:09:00]  they're meatballs  I like when  they're made of  peanut butter  and crockers  crockers  what  I like a  peanut butter  and crockers  that's not a  meatball then  yes it is  oh god I can't  stand Edgar  shit  do you think his  Twitter is good  shit  it's classic  what is it  I could read it  exactly like  exactly like Edgar's  dumb voice  oh what am I  gonna read here  holy shit 
[03:09:30]  cue the music  let's get out of  here  see you tomorrow  no I don't get  any bed music  I don't know  what are you reading  I had to blow out  the closer  hold on  what's the matter  fucking sauce on  your hands  yeah  sandwich on the  brain  sandwich  this  is  after  Opie and  Anthony  live  here's your  host  Sam Roberts  get that guy  out of the  studio  I told you  he's not 
[03:10:00]  allowed to be  in here  that's Roy  he's trying to  sneak in on  meatball day  thinking it's  okay  it's not  okay  we all remember  the horrible  terrible things  he did  and I won't  have them  anymore  here on  after Opie  and Anthony  live  no siree  866  wow1  wow is the  phone number  to call  I also saw  Denny  through the  windows of  this studio  wandering around  the hallway  seeing if  there's any  free food  available  that is correct  he came in  here  and this is  the craziest 
[03:10:30]  thing about  it  it's not  because somebody  went to his  desk and said  hey  did you hear  your buddies  the ONA  guys have  meatballs  no that's  exactly what  it was  he's at  the desk  listening to  the show  and going  oh there's  food in the  studio  that must  mean for  me too  there's  something  weird  and it's  built into  radio people  the longer  you're in  radio  the more  you want  free stuff  whether it's  t-shirts  food  whatever  and not to  the extent  that you  might  I know you're 
[03:11:00]  sitting there  going well that  sounds pretty good  if somebody's got  meatballs I'd like to  have some meatballs  but there's  something about  radio  where it's like  when you feed  a dog  and the more  food you pour  into his bowl  he'll just keep  eating it  there's no end  in sight for him  there's no part  of him that thinks  oh I'm full  oh I've had  enough  oh this is  going to make  me sick  nothing  it's just  if there's  free food  available  the longer  somebody's been  in radio  the more likely  they are to  just accept  yes  yes  yes  oh I do  need more  t-shirts  oh yes  I would like 
[03:11:30]  a station  hat  you know  it's all  this stuff  and it's  amazing what  happens  Denny's  Denny's  walking down  the hall  right now  with a  meatball  in his hand  this is true  correct Eric  yes  this is true  I mean it's  very much  like if I  sat there  you know my  big monster  cat  if I sat  there pouring  food for my  cat he would  continue to eat  it until he was  dead and that's  I feel like that's  the way radio  guys are there  is something  Denny and you  tell me because 
[03:12:00]  you're a radio  historian there  is something to  this thing and  I'm a young guy  so I'm kind of  I'm kind of just  getting the  experiences now and  I'm observing them  and who knows  where I'll be in  20 years but  there's something  to the fact that  radio guys just  love collecting  anything that's  available for  free  it's not as  it's not as  much like that  today it used to  be like that years  ago because  more so a record  guy would show up  to a radio station 
[03:12:30]  say hey go out  to the to the  car you got any  satin jackets  you got any  sweatshirts  you just get  you know hey  we're going to do  a Lionel Richie  weekend could you  send out a case  of a seat  yeah sure it  was like no  questions asked  now it's like  you got one CD  in a station  it's like we got  one copy of it  so you guys  so what you're  saying is  I don't like that  anymore  the reason that  I'm observing this  is because you  guys are  we ruined it  you're used to  a certain way  of living  you're used to  being able to  be like oh  somebody's here  from RCA  I'll just walk  up to him and  see if he has  any jackets  you go to a  restaurant and  you say hey 
[03:13:00]  I work at  station so so  so yeah  why don't you  put it on  and you go to  the phone and  you call up hey  look they just  put the station  on give them a  shout out  your meal is  comped  right  your meal is  comped  so now it's  like whenever  there's any  little shortcut  that's possible  you guys all  got to jump on  it  you know that  it used to be  the glory days  and that's not  happening anymore  but today Kenny  came over and said  hey they have  meatballs go make  sure you get one  I said well I  don't want to  upset Sal  it's not here  he said you  could have a  meatball  oh that's right  Sal's not here  today I don't  know if anybody  knows 
[03:13:30]  but you don't  want him to  go to waste  it'd be a sin  you're right  so what are you  going to do  you're enjoying  it right  sure it's always  good to have  meatballs and  coffee at 10  o'clock eastern  and that's the  other thing  there's no  semblance of  whether it's an  appropriate meal  or not  you could take  these meatballs  and leave them  out at 2 o'clock  in the morning  somebody will come  in at 7 o'clock  in the morning  and see them  sitting there  all night  they'll eat  them  radio guys  will eat  them  there's a  microwave  in here  it's just  like fresh  I remember  once I went  to my mom's  and she had  like a box  of pastries  and she goes  I said no  don't throw  them out  she goes yeah  I bought them  like two days 
[03:14:00]  well that's  what I know  it's like  my mom  she's made  treats for  the radio  show before  really  and I go  you can't get  any of those  treats  I'm sorry  to hear that  she makes  treats for  the radio  show  and I give  them to  you know  Opie Anthony  and Jim  I give them  to the show  staff  and then once  the guys  associated with  this show  say they don't  want anymore  I go  are you sure  right  because this  is it  that's it  it's like  15 seconds  max  and then my mom 
[03:14:30]  goes you know  I'd like to  platter back  when you're done  with it  I said I can't  guarantee it  it's torn  limb from limb  there's dents  in it  it's like  it's like  the board  when you get  the six foot  hero  she has to  give a down  payment for that  yeah  what kind of  treats does she  make  all kinds of  baked goods  yeah yeah  all kinds of  baked goods  you're not an  older guy  but you have  an old school  radio mentality  just because  you love it  so much  do you find  yourself  more veering  towards the  hey we're  in radio  we should be  getting freebies  all the time  yes but not 
[03:15:00]  to the level  like you said  the older guys  would  the older guys  would not just  want the stuff  but they would  also sell it  is that what  went on  I wouldn't sell  but there were  guys who would  do that  anytime albums  came in  going back  70s 80s  when new albums  would come in  or when CDs  were coming in  they would  take them  they would get  the bulk of it  and take it  down to a music  store and sell them  Obi said that  he used to  raid the prize closet  and then go to  the CD store  or whatever  I used to go to  this one new  wave store  maybe 8 track  I used to go to  this one new 
[03:15:30]  wave store  back in the 80s  sold new wave records  and he would  always have  a bargain  well the disco  record's in the  back  I'd say hey  you need this  Rick James record  he goes nah  you can take it  for a buck  and it'd be a  promotion copy  that probably  went to a radio  station  you would buy it  though  what was he  going to do  if I didn't  get it  if I didn't  get that record  I'll take it  for a buck  why not  but you'd  try to negotiate  a little bit  yeah  could you give  me two  three for two  bucks  nobody's buying  them  why not  shout out  on the radio  station  now it's like  what's radio  exactly  I'll give you 
[03:16:00]  a shout out  on the radio  station  well you're  not allowed  to talk  so you won't  be giving  anybody a  shout out  no you can't  and everything  has to be  justified  years ago  you could  just hey  I want to  say hello  to Dominic's  pizza and pasta  just set up  a nice  this is good  oh please  if we weren't  on Sirius XM  you know the  trouble Roland  would be in  for parading  food venues  in and out  of this place  that's what I  was doing  in Florida  where we got  the garlic  butter saw  clip  you were trying  to get freebies  from Papa John's  there was a guy  who delivered  for Papa John's  down in West Palm  and he always  called in  during my ship  and I just  started throwing 
[03:16:30]  stuff out there  all the time  and he would  just bring me  pizzas that  either oops  they forgot to  go to the  right people  one hand  washes the other  yeah  I guess that's  right  do you have  that garlic  butter sauce  clip  oh I don't  know if I do  see if it's  around easy  to find  I'd like to  remind people  what that was  like Nick  in Florida  yeah I used  to be a radio  guy from 1976  man so I can  relate to what  you guys are  talking about  I used to  get free shit  all the time  he's got the  voice  he smokes a lot  I've never 
[03:17:00]  seen a man  orgasm  in five seconds  before  you started  talking  and Denny  came in his  pants  because of  that voice  of yours  he's got  the pipes  yeah  what are you  doing now  with yourself  Nick  I'm working  as a store  manager  for a liquor  store here  in Florida  so I got  out of business  two years ago  my last gig  was doing  mornings in  Montgomery  Alabama  how come  you got  out of the  business  because you  realized he was  dead  it got  downsized  I got  replaced by  a syndicated  radio show  what radio show  tell me which  one  Ricky Smiley 
[03:17:30]  Ricky Smiley  let me  go ahead and  write that name  down for a little  month we have  coming up  but go ahead  I was doing  I was doing  urban mornings  myself and  my wife  you were doing  urban mornings  that means you  were talking  so you're talking  to black people  are you a black  man  yeah but check  this out  you are a black  man  yeah oh yeah  oh you sound  very Caucasian  to me  my wife is  Caucasian and we  were doing this  husband and wife  morning show on  an urban radio  station in the hub  of the civil rights  movement can you 
[03:18:00]  believe that  that sounds  terrific  sounds like you're  making a difference  we were making a  difference we had  old black ladies  calling us up  hello my children  how you doing  thank you  it was like oh  man  oh man  yeah we got  we got downsized  and had to move  back to Florida  because my wife's  mom got sick  and suffered a  couple of strokes  Jesus Christ  Nick way to  bring us down  a little bit  but he runs a  liquor store now  now you run a  liquor store though  now I run a  liquor store man  can you send  if Denny gives  you a shout out  on the 60s on 6  you send a couple 
[03:18:30]  bottles up to him  absolutely  whatever you want  I'll send them to you  alright thanks Nick  love you guys  oh  you miss the glory  days Denny  ah sure  but see look at  that this is the  way you gotta look  at it  Sal's busting your  ball well  making an attempt  to bust your  balls on Friday  maybe not terribly  successful  but you got you  who admittedly  not the strongest  voice in all of  radio  but you're still  in the business  there you go  Nick has the  voice you've  always wanted  it's a shame  and he's managing  a liquor store  yeah  that's this  that's this 
[03:19:00]  the business  that we call  show  that's where  we're left  I wouldn't be  good at running  a liquor store  why not  I'm not good  at math  is that it  yeah  and also  let's be honest  you'd drink the  place out of  business  Denny you'd be  drinking your  sorrows  ah that  fucking opie  always got  something to  say to me  glug glug glug  glug glug  yeah yeah exactly  shouting out  call letters  to your people  coming in  giving people  weather checks  every time they  bought a bottle  of Jack Daniels  how about a  belt here  come on  nobody would  want to talk  to you'd be  cursing Norton  for all the times 
[03:19:30]  he said nasty  things about you  on the air  just in a  drunken stupor  that's alright  but you're not  there  we had a good  time though  last week  Kevin Pollack  was by  that was a lot  of fun  no I remember  you don't have to  back sell  last week  I was actually  on the worst  of the  own air  this weekend  did you get  excited about that  that was great  how do you think  I do hosting the  worst of the week  countdown  was that you  that's me  you do a nice  job with that  but you didn't  even know it  was me  no I did  I heard it  last weekend  I heard you  last weekend  I heard me  this weekend  I was on my  way out to a  gig  what kind of a  gig  sweet 16 
[03:20:00]  yeah  yeah it was  good  yeah  it was smoking  get any of  that sweet 16  pussy  if you know  what I mean  any of that  little teenage  vagina  one of the boys  came over  and said hey  could you play  shots  by LMFAO  I said well you  know it's a  sweet 16  could you ask  your mom  and she goes  she wants to  hear it  did you really  ask the kids  to ask their mom  I said well  it's a little  suggestive song  that's not an  appropriate song  not an appropriate  song  yeah but what  are you gonna  DJ can't be a  square  Danny  again you just  have to watch  certain things  like that  you know 
[03:20:30]  some moms  might  so you know  E-Rock  he said it's  not an  appropriate song  yeah but E-Rock  thinks that  parents who sleep  in tents  with their kids  to see One  Direction  are bad parents  E-Rock is a  stick in the mud  okay he is  as curmudgeonly  as a 34  year old man  can possibly be  so for 15  and 16 year olds  you wanna play a  song where they  said they need  to drink so  they can suck  our cocks  well I'm saying  number one  there's probably  a radio edit  so we don't  know what  they're saying  suck our  who knows  right  it was moms  moms  moms wanted  that song  and second  she was paying 
[03:21:00]  the bills  so it's like  okay  and second  of all  you're at a  sweet 16  party  you can loosen  up a little  bit and realize  that at 16  years old  these kids  know what  shots are  and if they  have  if they have  a fancy enough  sweet 16  party  that they  have a DJ  like Denny  showing up  then that means  they're very  wealthy  well to do  family  and they got  probably one of  these bratty rich  kids who's doing  coke and alcohol  all the time  anyway  it was a new  orleans theme  too so we were  throwing out  beads and  everything  were any of  those high  school girls  taking their  titties out  you know that's

[03:23:30]  Sam Roberts  sounds like a  million dollars  how you doing  sir  great  Denny  pleasure to  talk to you  hey buddy  do you have  a flavor for  the milfs  yeah  you have a  taste I think  he's asking  do you like  milfs  is that your  choice  if you're  looking for  of course  do you know  what milfs  stands for  yes I do  yes I do  what does it  stand for  you tell me  no I'm not  mother I'd like  to  no just  I'd like to  be friendly with  fuck is the  answer  fuck was  the correct  I don't work  that way  you don't have  sex with  age appropriate  right  age appropriate 
[03:24:00]  age appropriate  age appropriate  so you've never  hooked up at a  dj gig  no  why not  because I keep  it business  that's the whole  point of being a  dj though  no it's not  not for me  for you it's all  about good times  and great oldies  good times  great oldies  getting everybody  out there on the  dance floor  getting those  hands up in the air  waving them like  you just don't care  Denny you are a  mystery my friend  you are a mystery  meatball  that's right  alright go get  yourself another  meatball  go help yourself  I appreciate you  stopping by  anytime Sam  after opening  anthony live  I want to tell you  can I take the  papers too  go take the  papers we don't  need them  help yourself  to a newspaper 
[03:24:30]  because Denny why  buy them if they  have enough up  here right  it's a waste  it's a waste  how many how many  times does a paper  need to be read  before it's not  being wasted  then I take it  and I bring it  back to the sports  guys or I just  recycle it I like  to recycle and  bring them on to  the train station  these big recycling  bins  I mean you see what  happens to the  garbage cans here  at Sirius XM  they just let them  pile up  it's a shame  it's a shame  you should just  leave them on the  floor in the  bathroom  Denny Eric's  suggestion is just  leave them on the  floor in the  bathroom  yeah once I bring  a paper to the  bathroom and I  read it I just  throw it out 
[03:25:00]  yeah if I see  newspapers on the  floor in the  bathroom I assume  that somebody  doesn't know how  to use a toilet  somebody was  walking out once  with the paper  under his arm as  he was leaving  and he handed  them to me and  I said thanks and  I just threw them  out and then  scrub those hands  alright buddy  thanks for stopping  by I want to tell  you while Denny's  off to get his  own taste of  Mama Mancini's  meatballs he knows  he knows how good  these things are  Denny's not going  to sit around and  eat a fake apple  that's made from  fillers and  preservatives no  what about a  meatball that's  made that way he's  not going to do  it like most  people you want to 
[03:25:30]  be able to  pronounce every  ingredient that  goes into your  food if you cook  at home you use  real fresh  ingredients if you  don't have time to  cook from scratch  Mama Mancini's  meatballs is the  answer for you  Mama Mancini's  starts with 100%  USDA graded  domestic beef for  their meatballs and  natural ingredients  like genuine  pecorino romano  cheese onion  parsley bread  crumbs eggs a  little salt a  little pepper real  ingredients that's  it Mama Mancini's  famous slow cooked 
[03:26:00]  Italian sauce is  made just as simply  as their meatballs  they start with  whole Italian plum  tomatoes crush them  and then add natural  seasonings Mama  Mancini's adds their  meatballs to the  simmering slow cooked  sauce for that  perfect combination of  flavors since 1921  Mama Mancini's has  never veered from  Grandma Mancini's  original recipe real  ingredients just  taste better Mama  Mancini's slow  cooked Italian sauce  and meatballs now  available at your  local supermarket I 
[03:26:30]  tried to do that with  DJ Who Kid in the  studio on Friday but I  knew I was in trouble  when I started the  live read with hey  Who Kid would you  eat a fake apple made  from fillers and  preservatives and he  said yes I would  then I was like okay  this is not going in  the direction that it  should be going well  I guess Britney Spears  I was reading about  this I got see I  heard Britney Spears  is coming out with a  new single I think  it's insane that  Britney Spears is  still coming out  singles because she's  figured out I guess 
[03:27:00]  she just figured out  how to do it she  goes into a studio she  basically like talks  like this as long as  she talks like this and  allow them to just put  something together for  her like she's figured  out a way to just kind  of talk in some kind  of tone and then  there's enough people  and computers around  her that they turn it  into a song and more  power to her but she's  still what is how old  is she 62 Britney Spears  I think she's 30 okay I  was I was off then but  she's aged quite a bit 
[03:27:30]  and she was forced to  release the single this  is what Travis is one  sheet says she was  forced to release her  single early after it  leaked online now it was  my understanding this  was becoming a big deal  because I was reading  Twitter over the  weekend and she was  saying that she was  sending her single to  Sirius XM hits one to  premiere did you read  that Eric yes she  sent it to Mikey piff  do you think she  directly like it was a  Britney dot Spears at  gmail to Mikey dot piff  no I don't think so 
[03:28:00]  either but I was reading  that Mikey piff is the  guy who if you remember  we talked about him  remember the whole  Carly Rae Jepsen thing  you guys remember the  song call me maybe I and  and my buddy Troy Kwan  blew the lid off that  whole thing we came in  here and said this is  going to be the new hot  shit and this was before  Mikey piff was playing  this on hits one Britney  Spears can tweet him all  the live long day about  you know whatever song  she's concocted now and  premiering that but I am 
[03:28:30]  the one who went to  Mikey piff is like what  are you doing you're  sleeping on this and I  did it again last week are  you ready for the next  call me maybe everybody  thought we were talking  about song in the summer in  whatever was may or  beginning of June  eric you're the one who  said blurred lines would  be the song of the  summer right yeah you  because everyone was  going with a kind of pop  as a show we agreed on  a kind of pop but as it  turned out blurred lines  was indeed the song of  the summer however  something's gone on where  everybody's feeling the  fall right now because  everybody's putting their  new shit out now lady 
[03:29:00]  gaga's got that song out  applause that didn't do  what everybody thought it  would I don't think  Katy Perry's song is out  and everybody's obsessed  with it but this is the  song that I had to tell  Mikey piff to get on this  shit because this is the  one you are going to hear  it everywhere I heard it  last week and I haven't I  didn't get a chance to  tell you guys about it yet  but I heard it last week  and I'm telling you I know  some of you don't love the  pop music but you have to  acknowledge when it's just  everywhere and it won't  leave your head Iraq do you 
[03:29:30]  know what song I'm talking  about I have it ready to go  you do yep you sure I'm  positive all right play it  this isn't it this isn't  this is the one she  debuted last night no I'm  not talking about Britney  Spears oh no go ahead  play it a little bit this  was debuted on hits one  yeah okay this is not I'm  not talking about Britney  Spears I'm talking about  the next song that's going  to be everywhere oh that  one let me hear what I  don't know what what  they've concocted in a in a  laboratory for Britney  Spears now this just sounds 
[03:30:00]  like a Euro dance track  what the fuck is this  is she speaking in a  British accent no she's  doing that baby talk that  she does and they have it  like over echoes and an  effect on it sounds that  that's very baby talk that's  either baby talk or a British 
[03:30:30]  accent she's just saying you  better work bitch over and  over yeah isn't that  RuPaul's thing that's just  you better work supermodel  oh she adds in bitch yeah  plus she figures enough  times pass that people will  forget all about RuPaul just  like Vanilla Ice right his  goes right and she goes no  because I ate because I ate a  bitch because why are you  talking like that Britney this  is just how I talk when she  has to do that soft or  intense kind of dialogue for  her song it always goes into  baby talk this is just how I 
[03:31:00]  talk and a bitch to me what  you're not pronouncing all  your syllables what's a  syllable I don't know what  you're talking about sounds  like an old Spice Girls song  that's what I'm saying it  sounds like a British accent  I hear it all right anyway  that's not the song that's  going to be I mean obviously  it's going to be successful  because every time anytime  Britney Spears gets somebody to  put her baby voice behind some  kind of melody it works you can 
[03:31:30]  make a song out of that I  could be a star but I would  have to have the credibility  and the tits of Britney Spears  beyond that I think I could get  there you rock the song is  called Royals and it's by an  artist named Lord Lord have you  heard this song no I have not  all right good I'm glad I'm  exposing you to something new  I think I have it this is  apparently the what boggled what 
[03:32:00]  really boggled my mind about this  was not that this is some 16 year  old girl that came out of  nowhere and is now about to have  like the biggest song in the  world this song is classified as  alt-rock and I think we've been  playing it on the alt-rock station  at Sirius XM and it's just  starting to trickle into the to the  hits channel but I'd like to me  alt-rock is like I don't know maybe  I'm dating myself but Foo Fighters  and Pearl Jam and and all that  stuff grunge and alternative rock  the radio head you could throw in 
[03:32:30]  there is alternative rock but I  guess this is what is classified as  alt-rock nowadays regardless do you  have the song yeah play it it's  gonna be everywhere I've never seen a  diamond in the flesh I cut my teeth on  wedding rings in the movies and I'm  not proud of my address in the torn up  town no postcode envy but every song's 
[03:33:00]  like gold teeth grey goose tripping in  the bathroom bloodstains ball gowns  trash in the hotel room we don't care  we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams but  everybody's like crystal may back  diamonds on your timepiece jet planes  islands tigers on a gold leash we don't care  we aren't caught up in your love affair and  we'll never be royals it's the one in our 
[03:33:30]  blood that kind of love just ain't for us we  crave a different kind of buzz let me be  your ruler you can call me Queen B and  baby I'll rule let me live that fantasy  this chick lord is 16 years old it's it  she's gorgeous she seems confident I  don't know what she's confident in  because she's only 16 but she seems like 
[03:34:00]  a real artist and all this stuff and I'm  telling you this is this is the new shit  it really this is the perfect song to  make you feel like as an adult you've  accomplished nothing that this chick has  already figured this shit out at 16  e-rock comment I don't know about this 
[03:34:30]  song yet tell me this is like the first  time I'm hearing it right it just I like  that it sounds it sounds like a girl group  that came off but like one of those  judging shows you think so yeah like this  is an x-factor band like this seems like  somebody who didn't win x-factor yeah this  is just one girl not a girl group no I know  it's just it's harmonizing with herself 
[03:35:00]  it's got a it's a it's good to have a  mellow vibe once in a while but yeah and I  think they're gonna have to remix it before  it gets club play this is gonna get hard to be played on regular radio no it won't do this is gonna be everywhere on regular radio you think pop stations are gonna play this slow version yeah pop stations will play this  it's almost done kevin what's up buddy 
[03:35:30]  what's up buddy  i gotta call you out brother uh all nation has been playing this for about two months now that's what i'm saying  eight year old has it on her ipad thank you and your eight year old listens played on fm radio in houston your eight year old listens to it a lot yeah that's what i'm saying that's and that's great that's the litmus test because i said i think it's it's been on  alt nation for a while because it's been classified as an alt song but pop stations are just now starting to pick up on it because they've been thinking like e-rock is thinking yeah it's a mellow song it's never gonna work blah blah blah 
[03:36:00]  what the fuck does e-rock know well he is sponsored by mama mancini's you know but my thing is right there you told me your eight year old is listening to it on your ipad  yep if you've got eight year olds listening to this shit on repeat it's a wrap  it's a wrap  good call brother later  thank you dude  i'm not saying that this is the first time anybody's ever played that song on radio  i'm saying it's it's very early that it's been recognized as it's gonna be a pop hit 
[03:36:30]  and you're going and i'm not you're not gonna because most places in the country don't have an alt station  that's why alt nation the alt station on sirius xm works  who's calling you  i don't know  who is it  what's travis got to say does he know about lord  ask him what he thinks  yeah the thing's done i gotta switch it hold on 
[03:37:00]  what do you think  he knows nothing about it he said  what's he doing  work stuff  that's  way to be specific  uh  jonathan  hey how are you doing sam  good buddy  i just want to let you know it is a great song but it's on mtv and vh1  it's actually vh1 artist you want to know for the month  right artist you want to know it's not a hit  no it's been out for a couple months though  then how is she an artist you want to know if it's been out for a couple months  i don't know i've heard it i'm saying 
[03:37:30]  a few months ago  because it's  yeah right right right  i'm not saying that i discovered this uh act  i'm saying that uh uh this song  before i want you to know  before the song is everywhere that it's about to be  okay  you feel me  i am absolutely okay  all right  all right buddy  uh let me go to george  yeah you're absolutely right  and my 16 year old been listening to this  she's all over it  you have a talent  to hear  what's going to be big  yes  that's your thing sam 
[03:38:00]  that's my thing george  yeah you should  drop this radio nonsense  and become the next simon cowell  i could do it  i could do it  yeah  all right buddy thanks  let me go to uh  i i've always felt like  i think  you know  if they give howard stern  a shot on uh  america's got talent  that means you know  they're talking to broadcasters right  i don't understand  why  american idol is not doing  what it used to be doing  i think i could go on  and be the snarky guy  on american idol  i can call this shit 
[03:38:30]  what's up luke  hey what's going on sam  how's it going  good  uh i just want to say  it's kind of like that  blurred line song  first time you hear it  you're like oh  you know something different  right  and boom  it just grows on you  it's gonna be the biggest hit  of the fall  keep it moving in the background  n-rock  because people  because that's the thing  thank you luke  and you're exactly right  like you said  and that's the way  a lot of songs are now  you listen to it  the first time  and it's like okay  this is weird  but it's not leaving  your head anytime soon  i promise you 
[03:39:00]  that's why i want to  make this statement  right now  after open anthony live  endorses lord  how do you like that  that endorsement  doesn't go out  it doesn't go out  very often  but that's a for real  endorsement  and the song  is fucking awesome  this is the  e-rock  i sing this song 
[03:39:30]  when i'm in my car  i'm still getting used to it  i don't know all the words  yet though  so sometimes i mumble  some of them  cadillacs in my dreams  kind of throws me off  but this  i get  i always get the  the hook part  i always go  we'll never be  royals  does that sound as good  as her  no  no  that feels bad  mark  what's up buddy  man you need to play  her other song  tennis courts  it just came out  much poppier 
[03:40:00]  you're gonna hear it  everywhere this fall  i'm not leaving this one  eric  i'm not ready to expose  everybody to the new one  yet  i appreciate that mark  don't be late to it  i won't  i don't like to be late  jash  hello  what's up buddy  how you doing  good  you know what i was  thinking of though  is uh  if all the 16 year olds  were already listening to it  if it was gonna be big  the song would already be big  no my friend  it's starting to trickle in  the 16 year olds 
[03:40:30]  are starting to  the way you're gonna  the way it gets big  is eventually  it starts seeping into  to people who don't  listen to this shitty music  yeah radio starts playing  it shows up in tv shows  yeah  tv shows commercials  stores  uh  and then eventually  you know  opie and anthony  will start talking about it  and pretend they discovered  it like gangnam style  kids and youtube  will find this stuff first  but that doesn't mean  even though it's been  look how long it took  macklemore to be huge  they were out  but it didn't mean it was a hit  until everyone else 
[03:41:00]  heard it and went  oh yeah this is good  because 16 year olds  much to my chagrin  are not  listening to the radio anymore  they're watching shit on youtube  and this video is big on youtube  this is some song  that somebody  one of their friends  passed to them  exactly  it's been on  hey check this out  and now you like it  because your friend told you  and it just gets passed that way  and then parents start figuring out  what their kids are listening to  and then it finally gets to radio  and then it becomes massive  parents are going  what the hell is this shit  right  where's the beat  right  i don't understand  what you kids listen to anymore 
[03:41:30]  is this drug music  is this doo-wop  yeah where's  i love that bruno mars  it's so much more upbeat  what's this girl so sad about  she's beautiful  you think bruno mars is what  michael jackson would have been  without all the uh  the surgery  i just hope to god bruno mars  doesn't burn his hair off  because right now  he's on a good  he's on a good  he's on a good roll right now  but one  one bad pepsi commercial  and he's in weirdsville  uh mike in albany  damn 
[03:42:00]  you're out  what's up guys  yeah i was gonna say  uh  fresh off this new sponsorship  i think you're out  got meatballs for brain  because  this song is gonna be huge  i mean it's uh  remember that icon of pop song  that was on all radio  for like uh  it was like a year before  and then once they hit pop stations  it just blew off  man  yeah the same  same thing as lana del rey  lana del rey was on uh  all stations forever  rob cross was  rob cross does xmu  and i think uh  no he doesn't do alternation  but he does xmu  and they were playing  lana del rey forever  and he kept coming 
[03:42:30]  like you gotta listen to this  you gotta listen to this  and then it did  it took a year  before anybody would take  poor rob cross seriously  and then they started  going to him  going hey have you heard this  and rob's like  fuck yes i've heard it  i heard it way back then  i have to admit  rob really is ahead  of a lot of trends  oh yeah  as far as music goes  he comes  because he comes in with stuff  and you're like what the  and then all of a sudden  okay now i'm getting it  and then you know  six months later  now everyone's  finally discovering it  well there's some music  channels here  that are very well programmed  rob cross 
[03:43:00]  you know you say  what you want about him  on the opian anthony show  and i don't like  we don't like to give out  compliments too often  but rob cross is on top  of his shit with xmu  uh  dr x  you know what i'm saying  here's what you do  you go to abercrombie and fitch  where all the kids hang out  i'm pulling something  but i like to dress like an asshole  good for you  good for you  buy those tight shirts  yeah  but dude i'm sitting there  listening to that music  and it's just  it's good music  it's all  i guess that's what they call it  nowadays to me  it's still rem and cure  right exactly  when they were like 
[03:43:30]  i was looking up stuff  about this song  i wish i'd come to you  last week with it  because i  it every day counts  but i was looking up stuff  about this song  and like  it was  it was all the alt stations  that were playing it first  and it's crazy to me  that like  i don't  this is now  this  it passes for alt rock  is this song  does it feature anybody  because i have not  seen one damn song  on itunes  that's not  layla featuring  nut sam  or eruk  who featured on this song  i won't buy them 
[03:44:00]  if it's almost featured  thanks dr x  nope  nobody featured on this song  this is balls  it's just some chick  you never heard of  named lord  and it's alright  it's like  it's in the itunes top 10  not breaking news here  but  i'm telling you  i want to make sure  we're we're  playing this shit  eventually you'll turn on  hits one  and they'll be caught up  to after opie and anthony live  but uh  not just yet  let me go to kyle  hey buddy  yeah thanks for this  this is the same  type thing that happened  when rod and fez 
[03:44:30]  played that  die ant word song  i listened to it  and i was like  ah  and then now  i guess y'all  are playing  i have to go to work  but y'all are playing  in the background  and i can't  get that stupid beat  out of my head  it's never leaving dude  it's so good  it's so good  thank you kyle  are you  what about now eric  now that it's been  cycling through your head  like an infection  for a couple rotations  as denny would say  yeah  um  i would tell you  but the line that you're  on right now  is pretty much going  to say the same thing  matt  give me what erock 
[03:45:00]  was gonna say  it's actually  it's that low beat  that bass line  where you don't want  you just don't want  to like it  like i'm 35  i have two kids  i'm bob  i'm like  moving my head to it  like it's  it gets into  your subconscious  it's hypnotic  and it's hypnotic  and you just  kind of like  it could be  you know  anything  for words  for lyrics  but it's just  and dude  the video  the video for this song  you want to talk about hypnotic  the video for this song  it's just this girl  and she's got this like 
[03:45:30]  crazy long curly brown hair  and she's gorgeous  but she's only 16  but she's gorgeous  and she's just  got her eyes locked  on the camera  and she's just staring  at the camera  singing the song  and you're like  i don't know  like i don't know  if i could be watching  this anymore  i i don't know  if this is still legal  matt obviously felt like  he was in trouble  uh  mike  hey sam  what's up buddy 
[03:46:00]  hey how you doing  i'm not sure  if anybody brought it up yet  but selena gomez  already covered this song  at one of her concerts  you go to selena gomez concerts  no i saw it on youtube  when i looked it up  i looked up the song  on youtube  and uh  she was one of the people  that came up  and sung the song  she's always trying  to get on top of shit  you know what happened  selena gomez  selena gomez called me  she said  sam i remember  i remember you exposed  the world to that  carly ray jeffson song  i remember  you were up on iconopop  pretty early  can you sam roberts 
[03:46:30]  can you tell me  what should i be covering  in concert  so i really see  because i'm starting  to lose touch  i'm in this bubble  of being like this rich  pop star  who's dating justin bieber  for some ungodly reason  please tell me  sam roberts  what can i do  to impress my audience  and i put her on  i put her on this mic  all right  i'll talk to you later  i know why i like this song  you like it now right  it reminds me of another song  what song  that has a bass line  similar and the snapping 
[03:47:00]  with the harmonizing  what's up  do you remember  a movie called  judgment night  no  it started  uh  dennis leary  emilio estevez  cooper goodin jr  i'm almost positive  i've never seen that movie  because i don't think  i've ever seen those people  together  it was pretty much a movie  that was made  because the soundtrack  was so amazing  like garden state  they had to do something  so they made the movie  for it  yeah  and this is one of those  uh the soundtrack  was one of those weird  collaboration soundtracks  where bands were put together  that normally wouldn't  play together  oh that's cool 
[03:47:30]  uh like living color  and run dmc  biohazard and onyx  you know that kind of  stuff going back and  forth  there's a song called  fallen by teenage fan club  with de la soul  and this has a similar  uh feel to it  i don't know anything  about that  you want to hear it  yeah let me hear  oh okay  you already hear it  in that snapping  oh in that  but  yeah i hear it 
[03:48:00]  in the snapping  in the bass  and i i love that  soundtrack  and i love this song  so now i know why  i like this new song  but did this song  ever do anything  no i don't think  this guy radio play  at all  but the soundtrack  did amazing  it's not like lord  yeah  the singing's not  the same  but the music  and the feel of it  is  look  i'll go back to lord  yeah go back to lord  because i need to make sure  that i do these things  because to this day
