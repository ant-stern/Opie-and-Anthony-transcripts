<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie and Anthony discussing Mars' absence due to shoulder surgery. They then transitioned to a mocking discussion of Jerry Springer's new show, "Tabloid," comparing it unfavorably to TMZ.  This segued into a vulgar critique of Steve Wilkos' show, which they deemed a derivative and repetitive version of Springer's format, filled with predictable guest types and superficial conflict resolution.

The conversation took a bizarre turn with a discussion of lawyer commercials, specifically those advertising niche injury claims, particularly focusing on gynecomastia (male breast growth) induced by medication. This prompted several listener calls detailing their experiences with the condition, ranging from humorous to disturbing, with one caller even describing self-harm related to his gynecomastia.

Jerry Springer then joined the show. The hosts and Springer engaged in banter about "Tabloid," Springer's career, the challenges of producing a talk show, the differences between his show and Steve Wilkos', his time as Cincinnati's mayor, and his family life.  They discussed the longevity of his show and its target audience, before Springer promoted his new program.  A discussion of the Chris Christie political scandal followed, with Springer, Opie, and Anthony debating Christie's knowledge of the bridge scandal and comparing his leadership style to past presidents.  Springer addressed a caller's question about forced fighting on his show, denying such practices and highlighting the self-selection of participants. He also revealed a "gay-off" segment that deeply disturbed him.  A heated exchange occurred with a caller criticizing Springer's liberal views and the show's relocation from Chicago, which Springer explained was a corporate decision. He shared a personal anecdote about working for Robert F. Kennedy.  Another heated exchange occurred with a caller about political corruption and term limits, which was diffused by a calm caller, Laura, from Michigan, leading to a discussion about political viewpoints and Detroit.  The segment concluded with promotion of "Tabloid," and banter about Springer's flip phone, followed by a promotional segment for an upcoming Opie and Anthony show featuring "The Sex Bagel," podcast and t-shirt announcements, and a surprise appearance by Chubby Checker performing "The Twist."

A substantial portion of the broadcast focused on the experiences of fatherhood.  Bobby Kelly, a guest in studio, detailed the challenges and humorous aspects of being a new father, contrasting his approach with his wife's more meticulous style.  John, a caller, sought advice on preparing for fatherhood, receiving sarcastic and darkly humorous advice from the hosts.  The discussion expanded to the impact of children on sex life and hygiene, followed by a discussion of the hosts' experiences living in houses versus apartments. Bobby detailed the hassles of homeownership and humorous encounters with contractors, while Opie compared city and suburban life.  A humorous tangent about Bobby's childhood habit of eating boogers ensued, followed by promotion of Bobby Kelly's stand-up shows and his podcast, "The Riotcast."  The segment ended with Bobby recounting a frightening experience after a fly-fishing trip with Opie and a recurring bit about breaking his knee.

Another segment with Bobby Kelly centered on his weight loss, upcoming performances, experiences in Bermuda, and his extravagant swim spa. The conversation became sexually explicit, including discussions about ejaculate longevity, bizarre travel experiences, and anxieties about parenthood.  Listener calls contributed to the offensive nature of the discussion.  A discussion about gynecomastia and its causes, with graphic descriptions and images, also occurred. The segment concluded with plugs for Kelly's shows and podcast and a final thought from Jerry Springer.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Real.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, let's do this.  Good morning, everyone.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Look at that.  Your media destination.  Another show.  Another show.  Yay.  Look at us.  Look at us go.  Yay.  Wow.  Another show.  That's right.  Yeah.  Mars is gone, huh?  Where's Mars? 
[00:00:30]  I can tell.  Yeah, it's a little.  As soon as I turn on the mics, I can tell if Mars is here or not.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Somebody else.  They're all right, but it's just not.  It's different.  It's a little different.  Yeah, it's a little different.  Where's Mars?  A little while to get used to.  He's having surgery.  He's out for like a couple weeks.  What?  I would say to go.  What kind of surgery?  I don't know.  I think shoulder surgery or something.  You were going to say soldier.  You were going to say soldier surgery.  Is it from his MMA? 
[00:01:00]  I think so.  Is it from his MMA?  Yeah, a little wear and tear.  It'll happen.  I don't like the sound of the mics, but we'll deal.  A little bassier than usual.  Right?  Not sure.  I don't need bass on my voice.  I got a fucking kick-ass voice, man.  Yeah, you got to take the bass off.  My voice fucking rocks.  Yeah, it's amazing.  Just treble it up.  Right.  It didn't always rock.  No, no.  We've heard some tapes.  Fantastic. 
[00:01:30]  Fantastic.  Anyway, we are here and you are there.  That's the arrangement.  And we got Jerry Springer in like 10 minutes.  Give us time to breathe before you start bringing these people in.  Jerry, Jerry.  Why is Jerry coming in at 7?  What is Jerry pushing?  I don't know.  Anyone?  I have no idea.  Sam, you know what he's pushing?  Is he still doing the Jerry Springer show?  Look at this fruit jogging down the hallway.  He's bringing you your Jerry Springer precious. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you, Sal.  Sal, why is Jerry Springer coming in today?  What's he pushing?  He's got his new TV show called Tabloid.  What?  He's got a new TV show.  Isn't that his TV show?  Why didn't he stick with the Jerry Springer show?  That's my first question.  Tabloid, tabloid, tabloid.  Are they going to chant?  Doesn't sound nearly as good as Jerry.  Tabloid working with outrageous characters, bearing all of the twists and turns and macabre motivations behind eye-catching criminal accounts. 
[00:02:30]  Tabloid unearths the most mind-blowing headlines of your favorite.  Is this, um...  Favorite checkout line magazines exposing the biggest stars.  Isn't this a current affair?  He's trying to take on...  He's trying to take on TMZ.  What's wrong with this guy?  Is that TMZ, right?  Yeah.  Freaking go retire, man.  You did the Jerry Springer show.  What are you doing?  The first episode, the kids are not alright.  The teenage years are challenging for most people, but Esme Zang copes with pressures from her parents in a particularly bloody way. 
[00:03:00]  The bling ring.  The young thieves takes...  I'm sure it'll be very, um...  He's taking on the bling ring.  That's three years ago.  They already made a movie out of it.  It came out.  It's coming on.  Jerry Springer.  The opera is currently playing in Seattle.  Jerry is not in the play.  So?  Jerry, Jerry.  According to Contribution Reports for the political committee, Charlie Christ for Florida, Jerry Springer donated $10,000 to the committee on December 31st.  Springer had his name.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, boy.  He is the executive producer for the Steve Wilko show.  That damn thing is still on the air?  I guess.  He sucked on our show.  He was a bore.  And I remember thinking, there's no way this guy's going to fucking make it.  Search will take him over.  How is that show still on the air?  What, Search?  Steve Wilkos.  This is not a game, people.  He was the mayor of Cincinnati for one year in 19.  A little check to a hooker. 
[00:04:00]  All right.  He worked for Robert Kennedy at the age of 25.  He was working for him while he was...  Doesn't Jerry listen to the show on his way in?  Yeah, he does.  We love you, Jerry.  Jerry, Jerry.  Make sure you bring some kind of dessert for us this morning or some kind of, like, some kind of treat.  Sure.  Prep Sheet should say he once called the Obi and Anthony show and begged them to stop having their listeners vote him through on Dancing with the Stars.  That's true.  We absolutely had power. 
[00:04:30]  I don't know if we still do.  Who knows?  That's...  I don't know.  You think we have a little power left?  We got the knuckleheads.  A little juice.  All right.  The knuckleheads.  They're going strong out there?  The knuckleheads.  Yeah, the knuckleheads.  I watched MC Search yesterday.  You did?  Yeah.  I watched them going back and forth between white person and black person.  It was a fucking alarming rate.  Oh, it was fantastic.  And is he getting things done on that show?  Or is he proving that he's just trying to do the Jerry Springer show?  He's fixing problems.  Is he?  This guy is actually making a difference and, you know, it's the same. 
[00:05:00]  And I noticed yesterday you could literally take the same guests day after day and just maybe dress them different.  Right.  And no one would notice.  It's the overweight, sassy black woman.  Right.  And she's not happy with her man.  That doesn't know how to keep sperm out of her vagina.  Right.  Has no clue how to keep that sperm out of her vagina.  How about you start there?  How about you block that shit?  So they both, they have a chow together. 
[00:05:30]  They have a chow.  What's a chow?  It's a kid, a son or a daughter.  Why is it called a chow?  Like a little dog?  No, no.  Like, she'll go, she'll go, and he the father, my chow.  Oh, chow.  Chow.  Oh, I gotcha.  Chow.  Chow.  I thought it was chow.  Well, it is chow.  Let's get some chow.  My chow.  Oh, it's chow.  Chow.  Yeah, it had a little I in there, just a little bit.  Not really.  No.  I've heard it.  Really?  Straight up chow. 
[00:06:00]  Chow.  Like a fluffy dog.  Right, like a fluffy dog.  A chow.  All right, so they got a chow together.  Yeah, and it's just her getting mad at him.  Yeah.  Him getting mad at her, and then MC Search.  Yeah.  Solving the whole fucking problem.  Yeah.  I see.  And you know, they'll go home and really, really assert themselves to making things better  and change themselves.  Oh, you think they're going to change their life around after an hour?  An hour.  Goofy show?  Of Search.  Right.  Really?  Oh, good for him. 
[00:06:30]  He must have superpowers.  Hey, it's not a game.  And I don't know what it is.  Search looks into the camera during breaks, and he's like, don't go nowhere.  And he's all mad.  Right.  He's just all mad at the camera and the show and everything.  You know what that's about.  Huh?  He's pissed off he never had a second fucking hit.  He didn't have a second hit after fucking, uh...  That shit's coming out finally.  I gotta do this shit!  Because we couldn't figure out another song after Pop Goes to Weasel.  Pop Go to Weasel.  You don't go anywhere!  This is all I got!  Don't go nowhere!  And then they, it's just like, it's kind of a test show. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Still.  It's not picked up yet.  Oh, I think it'll get picked up.  We gotta push it over the top.  I know.  I think it'll get picked up.  This world needs search.  Make it believe he's solving problems.  But the fucked up thing is, like, they don't have any sponsors.  Uh-oh.  So when he goes, don't go nowhere!  And then they go, coming up on search.  And they show, like, a scene from the next segment.  Right.  And then they come back.  Really?  Yeah.  Like...  Doesn't it have commercials? 
[00:07:30]  Well, maybe one.  It's like, Salino and Barnes, injury attorney!  And then they'll come back.  Oh, it's local shit.  Which I'm very pissed that Salino and Barnes changed their number.  You knew their number.  Well, that's some stupid song.  It's like knowing the fucking, uh...  8-6-7-5-3-0-9.  Well, it's like that one.  That's the...  Oh, and I know, uh...  Or it's like...  6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-7-7-7-7.  8-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7 
[00:08:00]  You protect that shit.  You gotta keep the same number.  It's everything to you.  Those fucking lawyer jingles. 
[00:08:30]  Because that's all that Search has for commercials.  Are like shyster lawyers that are trying to play.  And they all decided they need a song to try to get their number out there.  And they're so bad.  Epstein and Schwartz.  Call them out.  Is that a real one?  No.  But it might as well be.  Speaking of the lawyers, it's funny you mention that.  I like the lawyers that pick that specific thing that could happen to you. 
[00:09:00]  That one thing.  If you've had a hip replacement and it's cracked in your pelvis.  Right, right.  If you had a pelvic mesh.  Oh, I love the pelvic mesh.  And it's leaking.  Give us a call.  They're terrible.  But it's so specific to one stupid thing that could happen to you.  Oh, yeah, of course, Cars for Kids.  Thank you.  Yeah, seriously, you know that one.  Get lost.  We don't need you.  But I heard one last night.  I've got to write this shit down.  I'm getting too fucking lazy. 
[00:09:30]  Because now we've got to find it.  There's a drug that can make you grow breasts.  Yes.  But that's their whole thing.  That's the lawyer.  If you took blah, blah and you're growing breasts, give us a call.  Yeah.  Can you imagine making that phone call?  How awkward that would be?  Hello.  I just saw your ad on TV.  You don't want to say it?  Right.  I saw your ad on TV about that drug.  Right, right.  And I'd like to get a consultation.  Because you know they're going to ask a million questions.  Yeah. 
[00:10:00]  So are they firm and perky?  Right.  Or are they big sloppy tits that you grew from that medicine?  Did you wear a bra at this point?  And then you'd have to be in the office all embarrassingly unbuttoning your shirt and showing  the lawyer your tits.  That's what I was thinking.  I was thinking that whole scenario.  Oh, how embarrassing.  It's too embarrassing to me.  And then you've got to go to court eventually.  Could you imagine a grown man standing there with his shirt open, holding it open to the  lawyer, his tits out, and he's like, you did this to me. 
[00:10:30]  You did it, your drug company.  His tears are pouring down his tits.  Yes, but I think they would allow you not to have to show them live in court.  They probably would have a big picture, though, the big reveal.  Right, right, the picture.  This is how he looked before the drug.  And now what you're about to see.  Yeah, yeah.  But that would be the holy shit moment, and then you would get your cash finally.  Can you find that commercial?  That's a good one. 
[00:11:00]  It's about growing breasts.  Yes.  If you took a certain medication.  Does anyone else know about it?  Oh, wants to talk about the drug.  This guy might know.  Oh.  I love drug commercials.  They're hilarious.  Greg in Boston, what's up?  What do you say, boys?  It's been a while.  I haven't talked to you since you were up here at AAF Days.  Oh, and how do we know you from the AAF Days?  I used to play with Itchy Fish.  Itchy Fish.  I did some other bigger local cover bands. 
[00:11:30]  I was a bassist for them.  I remember Itchy Fish.  I remember Itchy Fish.  Itchy Fish.  It's a little Ziggy.  It's a little Ziggy.  I think he's a caller for you guys.  Yeah, I remember him, of course.  What is he up to?  Oh, God.  Last time he was doing, you know, work on cars.  I haven't talked to him in a year.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know, I know.  But Resperidol is the name of that drug you were talking about.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yes.  That sounds familiar.  What is it again?  Res.  R-E-S.  I don't know how to spell it after that, but Resperidol.  You got that, Sam. 
[00:12:00]  Resperidol.  If you've taken Resperidol and you've grown breasts.  R-E-S.  Resperidol or something like that.  You have big fucking tits.  One more thing before I go.  Frunkus.  A little Frunkus for everybody.  That's wonderful.  Thanks.  What the hell?  We'll put that on a shirt for you.  Yeah.  You got it?  I hope you enjoy it.  Oh, maybe that's it.  We might have it.  Attention, parents of boys who took Risperidol.  Risperidol, a medication for the treatment of ADHD, autism, and bipolar  disorder has been linked to gynecomastia, a medical condition in which boys develop female 
[00:12:30]  breasts.  Perfect.  Call 1-800-BAD-DRUG today if your son has taken Risperidol and been diagnosed with gynecomastia  or has grown female breasts.  The stock photo of the kid sulking in a corner because he's got tits.  Consultation call 1-800-BAD-DRUG now.  And there's your phone number.  1-800-BAD-DRUG.  Bad drug.  Oh, my God.  That's great.  Put gynecom...  What is it?  Gyno...  Put it in Google Images. 
[00:13:00]  I got to see this.  Yeah, yeah.  Gyna...  Is it just a little plumpage around there or do they get full-blown tits?  Gynecomastia images.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  The nipples get bigger.  Oh, he's got womanly breasts.  They get bud-like.  They do get like...  They get...  Oh, wow.  Oh, man.  Which one?  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, no.  He can't take his shirt off at the pool.  Get the fuck out of here. 
[00:13:30]  He's got nice tits.  Yeah, he does.  Come on.  Is that from this drug?  Look at those.  Oh, my God.  Go down.  Or...  No, the other way.  Which way?  To the right.  That's like nubs.  Yeah, that's like...  Oh, my God.  That's like what a 13-year-old girl would look like.  And that's on a poor boy...  Oh, boy.  Is he getting just fucked.  Oh, God.  The drug was taken off the market, so there's class action lawsuits right now. 
[00:14:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  People who made that drug must be so pissed that there's a commercial just about getting  money from them.  It's like you're the monster that made that drug.  This guy wants to talk about Salino and Barnes.  Injury attorneys?  Yes.  Derek and Long Island, go ahead.  Yeah, I know.  It was just funny.  I'm like Anthony.  I can remember all these musical numbers shit.  The number was...  Eight hundred sixty-one twenty-twenty.  That was the one.  And right after that, you're going to hear, Dad, what do I do with all this scrap metal? 
[00:14:30]  Just tell her to call, dude, brother, scrap metal.  Right after that.  Well, they get you remembering about their business, though.  Yeah, they...  Doing something right.  Those little jingles, they fucking put the phone number right in your brain.  Right.  That's it.  Absolutely.  All right, boys.  Punch it out, dude.  All right, man.  Good job.  I want to talk about this female breast thing a little more.  Springer's here already.  We just started our show.  How needy is this guy?  He's an old man. 
[00:15:00]  He's an early riser.  Oh, my God.  How long do we have him for?  Ten minutes.  As long as you want him.  Oh, my God.  Seemed like a good idea yesterday.  I even retweeted the guy because he's excited to be on our show.  It's going to be great.  We'll talk to you about MC Search.  Oh, my God.  Can we get you guys prepared for the telling us you got to go?  Maybe you guys can, like...  Do you want to say...  What's the safe word?  There is no safe word.  The safe word is get the fuck out.  Okay.  All right.  That's not safe.  What's wrong with you guys?  Oh, boy. 
[00:15:30]  I want to look at some of this.  How do you say that word again?  Gynecomastia.  Gynecomastia.  Keep scrolling.  Gynecomastia.  Do you have any gynecomastia videos?  Oh, my God.  Oh, what a sloppy-titted mess he is.  That looks like an old lady's breast.  Yeah, they're hanging.  They're long and wrong.  Oh, look at the nice perky ones.  Which ones do you like?  Oh, my God.  He's got banana tits.  It's the guy's got banana... 
[00:16:00]  It's, like, bad enough that you grow tits, but you don't even grow nice tits.  Right.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Wow.  Well, that's...  The big, puffy nips.  Yeah, that look like they're a bit swollen from...  Yes.  ...from a little excitement.  Oh, God.  That guy can't take his shirt off.  This shit really happens just from taking a drug?  That's terrible.  You can't even wear a t-shirt.  Your titty's popped.  No, no.  You've got to wear, like, fucking a bulletproof vest.  That one looks like Ziggy's nose. 
[00:16:30]  Oh.  The old Ziggy cartoon.  Anyway.  Oh, Jesus.  This is a video.  Poor bastard.  Wait, we've got a guy that has gynecomastia.  No.  I'm starting to learn how to say it.  I think it's gynecomastia.  Andy in Indiana.  Gentlemen.  Hey.  Hey, sugar tits.  Hey, I had it in high school.  I got that shit cut off, though.  But, yeah, they called me weasel tits in high school.  Why weasel tits?  Because my nipples were all swelled up, and they just called I wrestled. 
[00:17:00]  So, they called me weasel tits.  They'd fucking stick out of my tinglet and shit.  It was pretty embarrassing.  Oh.  How did you get it?  Oh, my God.  Sorry.  We just found a video where the guy is doing a selfie video, and he's topless, and he looks  completely ridiculous.  He's got two flapjack tits.  It's called My Gynecomastia Man Boobs, in parentheses, and me. 
[00:17:30]  Okay.  He's going to talk about it.  How long is this video?  It's four minutes, but we'll punch out later.  All right.  Anyway, Andy, how did you get yours?  I was a chubby boy growing up, and it just happened.  Oh, so it wasn't from a drug or anything?  No, no, no.  I had it just naturally.  Okay.  Did anyone ever pin you down in the locker room and titty fuck you?  No.  How embarrassing would that be?  That'd be embarrassing.  Kids could be brutal, though.  They can be cruel.  They can be brutal when they're tit-fucking you in the locker room in front of the rest of 
[00:18:00]  the boys.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  You and your tit story.  Let's go to Chris in New Hampshire.  Chris, I want to talk about gynecomastia, he says.  It's a teenage boy's dream.  I can play with my tits while jerking off.  Oh.  Go ahead, Chris.  This is perfect.  I mean, when I was a 14-year-old kid, all I could think about were boobs.  So now I've got my own hair, and I can whack off.  This is awesome.  You think you'd do that?  Or you think it would just be shame? 
[00:18:30]  Of course.  You'd be just shameful.  You'd be crying in your room every night.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'd be crying because I had great boobs.  Good one.  Thanks.  Let's see the first part of this.  All right.  Hey, guys.  Hi.  Chris here.  Uh-oh.  And hello.  I'm detecting something.  I'm giving you a little free show.  I think it's mysterious.  Sorry if I offend you. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, believe me, there's a good purpose to this video.  He's standing in front of a mirror.  I'm making this video just to...  Floppy, hairy tits.  Just to make a statement.  Hmm.  I'm not depressed.  You gotta be.  You look like a fool.  Not at all.  Yes, I'm sad.  But I'm not depressed.  What I am, however, is very frustrated.  Oh, yeah?  What happened?  I'm frustrated with the cards that I've been dealt. 
[00:19:30]  And I'm frustrated...  That's a seven-deuce offsuit.  ...that a person with my issues...  Mm-hmm.  ...would look for help...  ...just to find that someone with my issues...  ...sees other people with my issue.  What a bore.  Yeah, really.  You got female titties and you make a boring video?  Yeah, you're boring.  What the fuck?  You're boring. 
[00:20:00]  Is there any other ones?  I think he's got other issues besides the tits.  A little mysterious.  A little mysterious.  Some would say that's not an issue, though.  It's not.  Remember.  Remember that.  Justin here.  And today I want to talk about self-mutilation.  What?  And how gynecomastia led me to actually kind of hurt myself.  Uh-oh.  Thank you.  So I've heard a lot of stories out there, first off, so I'm going to state those first.  Yeah.  Where people have, you know, gone to the point where they've almost committed suicide or they 
[00:20:30]  cut themselves.  Oh.  Some people have even wanted to just shave off their chest and things like that with  a knife.  Oh, yeah?  Um, and I don't have an extreme story that's bad.  Yeah.  But I do have experience with self-mutilation and the fact that I used to take duct tape and  wrap it around my chest.  Uh, and this started at the age of about 12, 13 years old.  Right at the point where you were molested.  And then I found out that I had a problem. 
[00:21:00]  I didn't know that I had a problem and I thought it was completely natural until a girl came up  to me and she said, ha, ha, ha, uh, what's wrong with your chest?  Ah.  Um, ha, ha, ha.  So right after that, every single day before school, um, I used to walk in the backyard.  Apparently, if you have tits, it makes you a real dull guy.  Yeah, no kidding, man.  It just takes all the fucking thrill out of your, uh, your life.  Let's say hi to Stephen Connecticut.  Steve.  Yes.

You're making a little wee-wee, uh, during the day.  Right.  You don't need a full diaper, but perhaps you just need a panty shield.  It's a, it's a panty shield.  What a disaster. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, fuck.  Throwing tits, pissing yourself.  Shit.  That was terrible.  So, what's up?  I, I, I left, uh, my underpants with a horrendous, uh, racing stripe.  No.  Laying around.  Uh-oh.  That's something you gotta keep to yourself.  I usually wash it out myself in the sink.  The wife's gonna pick it up and be like...  I pray she doesn't.  That's not good, man.  Oh, man.  But it was, I, I guess my underpants were, like, stuck in my crack all night.  Oh, my God.  And, and this was a horrendous racing stripe. 
[00:23:00]  Like, just a big, thick brown crayon right down the middle.  And usually I get right in there and I wash it out in the sink.  Uh-huh.  I take my palm, like old school, like I'm down...  Scrub, down by the river.  Like I'm down by the river with a rock and I just fucking scrub it out.  And then throw them nice and wet into the, into the hamper.  Nice.  But I just realized that, uh, fuck, I was too tired when I woke up.  They're just laying there.  Ah, she's gonna pick them up and be like, give it that little... 
[00:23:30]  I gotta ask...  Shake and be, oh, let's see.  I gotta ask Kenny if he could go to my apartment and, and just remove them.  Like the wolf for fucking skid marks.  Yes, he needs to remove them.  Gentlemen, I hear there's a pair of underwear in here with a skid mark.  And we have, oh, 15 minutes.  Seeing Tony Saragusa, it reminded me of that.  Fuck!  Fuck!  No!  This can't happen today!  It only happens every once in a while.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not a, it's not an issue, but... 
[00:24:00]  But even, you know, those rare occurrences, you don't want.  What do you do with your underpants?  You don't want those out there.  Get a racing stripe every once in a while.  Uh, yeah, I'll wash those fuckers.  Do you worship them by hand?  Yeah, a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  You have to.  You got to.  It's your own duty.  You know, you can deal with that.  Oh, Jesus.  Jerry!  Look who it is!  Jerry!  Jerry Springer, my good friend.  How are you, man?  Jerry, you don't age.  What's wrong with you?  Ah, he's living the life.  He doesn't age.  Jerry's living the...  Are you a vampire?  He's living the life.  The guy who can lie. 
[00:24:30]  Isn't that strange?  The life of Riley.  Dude, you don't age.  It's creepy.  It's creepy, yeah.  It's kind of creepy at this point.  I was born in 1817.  Jerry Springer?  What's up?  You're, so, you're not doing the Jerry Springer show anymore.  Yes, I am.  Oh, he certainly is.  So you're doing two shows.  Oh, Lord.  Pardon?  You're doing two?  I don't know if they're reruns or not.  No, no.  Every Monday and Tuesday.  So you're still doing new Jerry Springer shows, and then you got another show.  Yes.  Yep, this is the new one that's coming up.  The new one, Tabloid. 
[00:25:00]  Tabloid.  Have you seen Search yet?  Oh, have you watched...  Being huge Jerry Springer.  We're huge Jerry Springer fans, of course.  We've watched it for years, and now this guy is trying to do your fucking bit.  It's another show where...  And he's trying to make believe he's not, like...  He's trying to help people through the nonsense.  Look at Jerry.  Yeah, well, if you're on television, you can't be helped.  You can't be helped.  You don't think these people that actually come on can be helped?  In an hour.  This is true.  We actually tell them, do not come on this show to receive... 
[00:25:30]  Because I'm not trained to do that.  Right.  I'm not a professional.  That's why you've lasted so long in this business.  You're honest.  Well, yeah.  But, I mean, anyone would be.  I mean, you can't...  I'm not trained to...  You know, this would be horrible.  You give someone advice.  Right, right.  And then they take your advice, and they jump off a building.  I mean, you know, you can't do that.  Well, Search is trying to do just that.  This guy who, back in the 80s, he was...  Don't worry.  We can talk about him, because the show's not going to last straight.  I wouldn't worry about it.  You relax. 
[00:26:00]  We've got this one.  It's like the set looks like yours.  The set looks like yours and everything.  It's the same people, but he doesn't want to...  He wants people to think that he's helping them.  He's like, laying your hand on another person is not the answer.  He's taking my final thought.  No, he calls it Search is 60.  I've got to go back and rewrite it.  His final thought is Search is 60, and for a minute, he gives a final thought.  He's doing your show, Jerry.  It's ridiculous, Jerry. 
[00:26:30]  And we're not happy about it.  Okay.  I know.  You can lead the campaign, then.  We're going to.  Yeah, I know.  We're going to.  I know about your campaign.  We're going to, Jerry.  We got this.  Don't worry about it.  But we do the show up in Stamford, Connecticut.  Right.  We're up the road.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Now, I was very curious as to how you get the guest or the studio audience in Stamford.  You get people that don't have lives.  You know, honestly, that was a concern when NBC said they're moving us to Stamford out  of Chicago because for 19 years we had been in Chicago, and obviously that's a great city 
[00:27:00]  and all that.  And I really didn't want to go because I said, why mess with it?  Right.  But I was wrong.  Stamford, first of all, it's a suburb.  It's right outside New York City.  Sure.  And then you got all the college campuses.  You get them from Boston, from Connecticut, from New York, from New Jersey, Pennsylvania.  I mean, it's like, so we have had no trouble.  I mean, we sold out every show.  So it's been great.  And I guessed wrong because I argued against me. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  But why do they want you to leave Chicago?  Tax breaks.  Oh, really?  I mean, it was a pure corporate decision.  They moved a lot of the shows out of New York.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They moved Maury out of New York.  They moved Deal or No Deal at the time out of California.  And they moved us and Wilco's out of Chicago.  Yeah, economically, it's just got to be a lot of people.  So that was the reason they did it.  Do you ever look at your audience and get scared?  No, the audience is, the audience is regular. 
[00:28:00]  Well, we did the audience of college kids or whatever.  No, the people on stage sometimes.  Yeah, yeah.  The audience is just having fun.  No, I have a second part to that.  It was when we did the John McEnroe show, the short-lived John McEnroe show.  Oh, right.  We came out on set, and the audience was downright frightening.  And it was homeless people, and people were sleeping in the audience.  It was like they came in to get warm, I think.  Ex-cons.  I'm serious.  Well, we turned down the heat because we don't want people to get warm. 
[00:28:30]  Just to get warm.  We're really cruel.  But, I mean, colleges love you, so you do get that type of person in the audience.  Look, the show, the only reason the show is lasted is because it's a niche show.  And the only advice I would have if you're starting a show, aim at young people.  Because that's the only way you get longevity.  Because there's always a new group of young people.  In other words, if you do a show aimed at 30-year-olds, in two or three years, they're tired with it.  They've seen it.  Your tastes don't change between 30 and 33. 
[00:29:00]  But your tastes do change between 13 and 19.  So, all of a sudden, you're old enough suddenly to watch when mom isn't home, that kind of thing, the giggle factor.  So, every year, we suddenly get new people old enough to watch.  And that's why the show keeps going for years.  This show could, I mean, it's not.  I'm going to at some point stop.  But the show could go on forever simply because there were always new young people.  How many years?  We're in our 23rd year now.  We're up to 20. 
[00:29:30]  This is our 20th year in radio.  And you look just the same.  Oh, yeah, right.  No, when I turn on that radio, I see the same guy.  No, you guys are great.  Tell us about the new show.  The new show is called Tabloid.  And actually, it premieres tonight.  Yes.  It's on Discovery, right?  Yeah, on Investigation Discovery.  Okay.  I love that show.  9 o'clock Central Time.  10 o'clock Eastern Time.  And yes, so it's a one-hour crime show. 
[00:30:00]  And these are some of the incredible headlines over the last 20, 30 years that you see as you're checking out in the grocery store.  Sure.  In the tabloids.  Right.  But they're true crime stories.  And we go into the back story of it.  And it's pretty dramatic.  I take none of the credit.  I mean, I didn't create the show.  So, no, I'm serious.  You know, I have nothing to do with this.  I'm the host.  Right.  And when I saw what they've done, it's dramatic. 
[00:30:30]  It's one of the stories I vividly remember.  It's a story about this guy was dating this woman, this young woman, and she broke up with him.  He gets ticked off, hires these guys to throw lies.  Oh, right.  In the blinding this woman for life.  Yeah.  I mean, right in her face, blinded her for life.  And there was this big trial.  Everyone was talking about it at the time.  He gets convicted.  He spends 14 years in prison.  Probably the sentence was longer, but he got out after 14 years. 
[00:31:00]  Finds the woman again.  They get married.  And they stay married for 34 years.  She just passed away last year.  That's crazy.  34 years.  Ah.  It's an incredible story.  It really is.  You can't.  That stuff, you just can't make up.  Could you even imagine trying to start an argument with her?  I was going to say, you think that comes up from time?  It might come up during a dispute, you know?  Well, a cynic would say she didn't know it was him. 
[00:31:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Very good, Jerry.  That's a good one, though.  But that's only a cynic.  Right.  Not someone like me.  Of course.  Yeah.  Who thinks that's not the case.  But no, that's an amazing, amazing story.  Do you remember that story?  Yeah, I do.  Yeah.  Yep.  I vaguely remember it.  The Lion of Faith.  Yeah, when they told me about it, I said, oh, my God, I remember that.  Yeah.  What other stories you had on?  Well, tonight they had the bling ring.  These kids in California.  California.  Right.  Yeah.  That broke into Paris Hilton's house. 
[00:32:00]  They figured out a way, just as a kind of a fun thing to do.  You know, they were stalking her, in a sense, because they were fans.  Right.  And they figured out, with Google and everything else, how to get into her house.  And then, once they were successful, stole a ton of jewelry and stuff.  You know, stayed in the house when she wasn't there.  Played with the dog.  Just everything.  And then they figured, well, we can do this to other celebrities.  Wow.  And it went out and it had a horrible ending.  But you look at the wall. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, see?  A horrible ending.  I like that tease.  I like a good horrible ending.  Next.  Next.  Tabloid.  Tabloid.  Oh, that's cool.  Wow.  I'm going to watch that one.  Terry's keeping busy.  Yeah, you are always a busy guy.  I have expenses.  That is a lot of expenses.  Do you think it's slowing down at all?  My expenses?  No.  I wish they were.  No.  No.  I mean, I, you know, and you always roll your eyes. 
[00:33:00]  But it's true.  I'll show you how lucky I am.  Okay.  We all understand that doing my show is, you know, adults could do it.  But then, you do these other things.  Well, it's true.  And then this, this is a phone call.  Someone called me and said, we're having this new show, a crime show, and we'd like you to host it.  So what did I do to, I mean, that's what I mean.  This business is luck.  It is luck. 
[00:33:30]  Fell in your lap.  Well, you know, people say, well, I work real long.  Yeah, I work hard.  But a lot of people work hard and don't have, you know, what I got.  So I'm grateful.  And you taped all the shows already.  So now you just sit back and enjoy it, right?  The first 10 weeks, yeah.  Wow.  So what do you do at the beginning?  Do you walk out by a police beacon and police tape?  And you're like, tonight's story is something like that.  You've seen it.  I love it.  Come on.  This is what happened.  The red siren in the background. 
[00:34:00]  Just spinning.  December 7th.  14.  There you go.  I can do Walter Cronkite now, but, you know, the young people don't.  They don't know who it is.  That's the problem with getting impressions from, you know, years ago.  Well, now I'm old.  I mean, I'm officially old.  Officially?  Well, I'm 70.  So that's all.  You can't say you're middle-aged.  You know, I'm not going to make it to 140.  Well, you never know.  So you're not middle-aged at 70.  I'm an old man. 
[00:34:30]  And that is the truth.  It's depressing.  Well, I'm considering the alternative.  It's nice.  Well, yeah.  It bothers you that you're 70?  This is the first time.  It didn't bother me when I hit 60.  Right.  70, I've got to admit, I think about it.  Because, you know, all of a sudden you realize, you know, I'm having such a great life.  You don't want it to end.  Right.  Yeah.  So it's like, oh, jeez.  So I get depressed sometimes.  But not longer than I get happy.  People are living a lot longer, though, Jerry.  Yeah.  Well, the 70s and new 69. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  Oh, it's unbelievable.  I am living all along.  But I feel good.  Is that the constant drive that you have?  Do you feel like if you do slow down and take some time off and stuff, you'll fall into this retired guy syndrome?  Well, it's not anything I've really thought about until recently because it becomes a subject of conversation.  Yeah.  Birthday's coming up.  Right.  Honestly, as long as I'm healthy, I can't imagine retiring. 
[00:35:30]  That is scary.  And, in fact, there was an article just the other day in one of the papers now about because this generation, what do you call it?  The people born 46?  The boomers?  The boomers.  Yeah.  Jeez.  I'm losing it.  It's great to be on your show, George.  So, no, yeah, the boomers, the baby boomers, there's so many of us now. 
[00:36:00]  And all of a sudden, you know, because of technology and medicine and all that, you know, we are healthier as a whole class of people.  And now all of a sudden, you know, we're going to have years after 65.  Right.  And so you don't want to just sit around.  I mean, I really don't.  That scares me.  I take these jobs because, well, you know, in this business, once you stop, you stop.  You stop.  You've got to keep your face out there. 
[00:36:30]  Well, yeah, I can't say I'm going to take a few years off and can I come back when I'm 80?  Yeah, yeah, you've got to keep working.  Dead people starring Jerry Springer.  Yeah, that is true.  I've seen, though, I've seen people who retire and in a very short period of time, they go downhill.  It's amazing what that drive to get up in the morning and have something to do.  Oh, the whole thing with the adrenaline keeps your mind going.  Right, right.  I don't even think about it. 
[00:37:00]  Well, what do you do when you're not working, Jerry?  What are some of the things you like to do?  Now, I am just, my grandson has taken over my life.  Oh, yeah?  It sounds like just, you know, you always say it.  It is God's truth.  It is like, I'm telling you guys, if you're lucky enough one day to have grandchildren.  Grandchildren?  I just started having kids.  I know.  I'm not going to make it to grandchildren.  That is tough.  Are you kidding me?  If you could find a way to have grandchildren without having kids, you got it made.  I already accept that I'll never be a grandfather. 
[00:37:30]  I got two kids, Jerry.  They're very young.  They're very young.  Well, it's way heavier.  How old are you?  My daughter's, our daughter's 38 and our grandson's five.  Nice.  That's a great age.  Every day I'm taking him to school, preschool, junior kindergarten.  And I say, come on, Richard, we're running late.  He says, don't worry, Opa, they're open until three.  They're open.  I mean, the kid's old attitude.  Oh, he's going to have a show.  That's a great attitude.  But it's just the best thing in the world. 
[00:38:00]  It really is.  I mean, like this last Christmas holidays for two weeks, I had him.  Yeah.  Oh, it was just great.  Does he know that you're on TV?  Well, yeah, this is, again, true story.  They, he's, you know, I'm walking with him down the street and people are going, Jerry, Jerry.  So he's figured, so he asked me one day, he says, how come, who's Jerry, Jerry?  Because he knows me as Opa.  Right.  And I said, well, that's like my real name.  Like, you know, Mimi's name is Mickey.  You know, my wife is grandmother. 
[00:38:30]  So that's just my real name.  And then people are always taking pictures.  So now he always wants to be in the picture.  So anyway, so the other, so I said,  my real name is Jerry Springer.  And this was last year, but we're walking by his room and he's saying his prayers before going to sleep at night.  And we hear through the door, you know, God bless mommy.  God bless daddy.  God bless Mimi.  God bless Oprah.  And God bless Jerry Springer.  So, you know, it's just like, how cool is that? 
[00:39:00]  That's pretty cool.  Yeah.  But he doesn't know that you're on TV yet at five?  Well, he does.  Obviously, we don't let him see the show.  No, no, no.  But there are enough other appearances that.  I would assume you would let him see, like, the first part when you walk out or your final thoughts.  Well, at some point, you know, we were just talking about this actually last week.  At some point, I'm going to bring him to Connecticut and let him, yeah, just see the first part.  And then I'll obviously take him out.  Yes, yes.  That'll blow his mind.  Oh, when he sees all those.  My son's starting to figure it out.  He's like, he's trying to figure out why my voice comes through. 
[00:39:30]  He doesn't understand.  It's even a radio yet.  But he's like, what?  Sounds like the audience.  They're trying to figure out why.  Daddy, why don't you come out?  Yeah.  Are you in there?  Yeah.  Right.  How do you make yourself so small?  And it's hard to explain it to him.  Yeah.  Because this is a silly job.  This is a joke job.  No, but you do it.  God's work?  Do we do God's work?  We're doing the Lord's work, right?  Yes, yes.  No.  Not at all. 
[00:40:00]  No.  If this is God's work, we wouldn't have Earth.  Yes, yeah.  But you're also involved with Steve Wilkos, who used to be your security guy.  Yeah, we produced that show.  Uh-huh, you produced that show.  Now, there's a guy who's trying to make a difference.  He's actually, you know, telling people.  The show is definitely a little different.  What have it?  Well, because he's been, he's no longer a cop, but he was a cop.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, so he plays the tough cop role in Your Face.  He gets in Your Face.  Our show is just a circus.  Right.  You try to do his show as a more serious show. 
[00:40:30]  But are you flattered by all these shows that kind of rip you off?  I mean, we were talking about Search, but, I mean, as soon as we saw it, we're like,  this is Jerry Springer, man.  There's so many.  Period.  You know, he's trying to make it sound like it's different, but it's not.  They love that over-the-top competition.  Does it bother you, or?  No, but why does anyone want to be me?  I'm going to think about it.  This is my goal in life, man.  But you're the best at it.  No, I mean, who came before?  Okay.  I was going to ask that.  Who came before you? 
[00:41:00]  Who was the closest show to you before you?  Phil Donahue, maybe?  Well, no, because he does, even though Phil Donahue has a relationship to my show, because  it's the same company, and it was because Phil was retiring that they came to me and said...  Oh, is that the whole reason?  Yeah.  Walter Bartlett, he was the CEO of Multimedia, and I was anchoring the news for 10 years on  the NBC affiliate in Cincinnati, where Multimedia was. 
[00:41:30]  But they also own talk shows.  They own Phil Donahue, Sally Jesse, Raphael.  So one day he took me to lunch and said, you know, Phil's getting close to retiring.  We're going to start another talk show.  You're going to host it.  So I was assigned to this.  I never auditioned.  I never tried out.  It was never on my radar.  I want to do this.  And even when he told me, it didn't make much of an impression.  I wasn't excited.  I enjoyed doing the news.  I didn't want to go into a daytime talk show.  And they just signed for 13 weeks.  So I figured, well, this, you know... 
[00:42:00]  But I remember not...  It wasn't like I ran home and said, you'll never believe what happened.  I got a talk show.  I just thought this was...  You know how they give you different things to do.  You know, they adjusted the pay and all that.  But it was nothing major at all.  If we watched some of those first episodes, would we even recognize it as the Jerry Springer show?  Probably not.  The very first show, and I guess the reason I remember it is because, you know,  they always show clips of the first show, that kind of stuff.  It was a reunion show.  A mother and son hadn't seen each other in 35 years. 
[00:42:30]  So, you know, that was the big thing back then.  Right, right.  That was a big topic.  That was.  Yeah.  And so the mother's there, and I say, I forget what the son's name was, come on out.  And I turned to the side of the stage, but he was coming out the other side.  So you see, so my arm is going out here to the left, and on the right, you see this guy.  I mean, it was very amateurish.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Wow, that's a little clip. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  Right there on the monitor.  Oh, there it is.  A little clip.  And he was checking around, making sure everything was, you know, getting started open.  Wow.  Everything's online now.  Look at that set.  Yes, that's different.  A ghost threw her down the stairs.  No, this is a different show.  A ghost threw her down the stairs.  Yeah.  Do you believe in Ghost Jerry?  Not particularly.  And then Jerry said, hey, let's bring the ghost out.  You want to see the ghost, people?  Yeah.  What do you mean you can't see?  Right there. 
[00:43:30]  Right there.  She starts fighting, throwing her shoes at the ghost.  No, I guess my point is there was nothing really edgy before you.  That's why I said Phil Donner.  There was.  Oh, gosh.  I should remember his name, because he was here in the New York area.  Morton Downey Jr.  Well, yes, but that was, he was confrontational with the guests.  Right.  That was different.  I'm never confrontational.  Yeah, that's true.  Richard Bay.  Oh, Richard Bay.  Okay, sure.  He came before you. 
[00:44:00]  He came before me, but it was more local.  It wasn't a national show.  That was Channel 9, I believe, here in New York, right?  Yeah, yeah.  That was a more local show.  But I guess when I, I mean, we didn't, look, when our show started out, it was a more serious show.  Right.  It wasn't like we were trying to help people, but it was a political show.  We had Jesse Jackson on, Oliver North, because that's my interest in politics.  Like, so we did most of that.  But then Universal bought us and said, you've got to be crazy.  Here, here you go.  Oh, so you remember the twist.  You remember that day when it was like, okay, we're getting rid of everything we know, and we're going down this road. 
[00:44:30]  I'll tell you how it happened.  Yeah.  It's a perfect example of unintended consequences.  We had been on for about two or three years, and it was a normal talk show, frankly, kind of boring.  But there were 20 of them at the time.  This was in the early 90s.  There were 20 shows, and every one of them was trying to be like Oprah, you know, appeal to the demographic at that time, which was middle-aged housewives. 
[00:45:00]  And then along came Rikki Lake, and she really was the first show to go after kids.  When I say kids, I mean high school, college age.  And so one afternoon, I'm walking down Michigan Avenue with our executive producer, and I say, just as a business model, why are we trying to be one out of 20 going after Oprah's audience and get a tiny piece of the pie?  Let's go after Rikki's audience, and even if we split it or get a smaller percent, it's going to be one out of two.  We'll have many more people watching.  So we decided, and then we went to the company and said, okay. 
[00:45:30]  So from then on, we only had young people in the audience, young people on stage, young subject matter.  Well, young people are wilder and much more open about their lives and whatever.  So the show started to go crazy.  Then Universal bought us and said, from now on, you can only do crazy.  And that's how that happened.  What was the first crazy topic?  Do you know?  That might be a tough question at this point.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It wasn't that we picked a crazy topic. 
[00:46:00]  It's that we had young people.  See, we never picked a topic ahead of time.  It's after the show is taped.  Then we figure out what's the title of this show.  Because we don't know what's going to happen until they're out of these people.  Right, right.  So you don't know.  So we always, the titles always come after the show.  How many times did you have duds on that stage?  Oh, quite a few times.  And what do you do?  Do you show that show or you bury it?  Well, if I'm talking a lot during a show, then you know the show is dying.  The best show is when you hardly see me and I hardly talk. 
[00:46:30]  Gotcha.  Because then it's just moving.  I like when you have to step back out of the action because there's a fight going on.  But Jerry gets this look like, oh, no, don't do that.  Oh.  You're loving it.  No.  It's like this.  Oh, look at the world we live in.  Like, oh, no.  But inside it's, cha-ching, cha-ching.  I mean, I have that face because I'm not sure what time the bank closes.  And I'm thinking, are they going to get this done in time?  Because I really love to get this. 
[00:47:00]  You brought the fights to TV.  I can't remember a show that had fights before Jerry Springer.  No, not like that.  There was one, but it was only one time.  In the 80s, Geraldo Rivera had a big fight where he got hit.  The Klan on.  Whatever.  It broke his nose, right?  Yeah, it broke his nose.  That was the only time there had been a fight.  I got some press that one.  I remember that.  It sure did.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the fighting.  And then at some point they made you tone down the fighting.  And they cut away from the actual.  Yeah, there was, I think, Barry Dill aboard us. 
[00:47:30]  Uh-huh.  And, yeah, there was about a year period where they, we still had the exact same show.  Right.  But they edited it differently.  They edited it.  Like, the second the fight would start, they'd go to the audience or something.  I'm like, what the hell are you doing?  And that's when I was still watching a lot.  You know, our lives have just changed.  That's all.  We still love Jerry Springer.  It used to piss me off.  I know.  Who thinks this is a good idea?  They figured out the formula. 
[00:48:00]  They got huge ratings.  And now you're going to try to take a huge element of the show away from everybody?  Yeah, but that only lasted a year.  That was only a year.  I feel like it was longer than that.  Yeah, people just like watching trashy people beat each other up.  It's horrible.  I don't know why.  It's horrible.  They just love it.  I love Springer.  It is entertaining.  I love your honesty.  Yeah.  Hey, when you were the mayor of Cincinnati, did you ever close a bridge?  Oh, good subject.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Because we know Jerry. 
[00:48:30]  Dirty tricks.  Jerry loves his politics.  Yes.  No, I never.  No, I never close the bridge.  I never close the bridge.  Any dirty tricks?  But you understand the power of the position, right?  Yes.  Did you ever feel like you had a little power?  You were only the mayor for a year.  Yeah.  You have your power to retaliate?  To be honest, the answer is no.  And I think most don't.  I mean, oh, I could be political and all that, but you'd never involve the public in it.  Well, yeah. 
[00:49:00]  Because they're going to vote for you.  Yeah.  I mean, it's just not a good thing to do.  So it's not like, oh, should we or shouldn't we?  It just never even, you know, if you're angry at someone, then you have that argument with that person and you deal with it that way.  But you don't, you know, and I don't know, I don't know the full story, but here's one observation I'll make.  Look, I'm a liberal Democrat and all that.  But if there had to be a Republican, you know, I kind of liked Christie. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, but to a certain extent, I feel a little bit sorry, not if he did it, not because of what he did, but because here, if you're in the conversation running for president,  if you get in any kind of trouble, you're alone because you're not even having your own party backing you because everyone else in the party wants to be president.  Yeah, yeah.  So it's not like the Democrats are beating up on Christie.  Right.  The Republicans are going, oh, this is great because now I got a better shot.  Right.  Yeah. 
[00:50:00]  So you're not going to see Rubio jump, you know, or Cruz.  No, you don't defend.  Yeah.  That's the guy that's going to be in your way.  No, so he's really hanging there.  Right.  And the party is not coming to his defense.  Right.  Right.  Because they're all ambitious.  What do you think happened there, Jerry?  I know it's pure speculation, but what do you think?  Well.  You think he knew at the time, I mean.  If someone told me a gun to my head and said, you better be right or you're gone.  Right.  I would say it's more likely he knew than he didn't. 
[00:50:30]  But that doesn't mean it came out that he actually did.  It's amazing what it, and this goes for everybody and not just politics and business.  It's amazing what the person at top doesn't know.  And when something bad happens, we all jump on that person.  But we're not being realistic.  Because when you're running a huge operation and you've got literally thousands of people working for you, you have, there's no way.  In fact, if you were so hands-on, you'd be a horrible leader because you wouldn't be getting the big picture because you were involved in everyone's conversation about what they were doing every single day. 
[00:51:00]  No chief executive is there.  You have people under you, and you trust that they're going to, you know, here's how a chief executive day starts.  You have the morning meeting.  And it's the same thing whether you're running a newsroom or whether you're running a city or whether you're running a country.  You have the first meeting in the morning, and they go through all the things that are going on, where the hot spots are, where it could be a problem, how we're going to deal with the press, all these things. 
[00:51:30]  So that's as close as you get to it.  So now the question gets, and this is where Christie has a problem, I think, is at those morning meetings, did no one mention to him, or when he's, you know, going from place to place with his assistant, the woman, her name is.  Bridget.  Yeah.  I forgot her last name.  Yeah.  But anyway, you know, didn't she at some point mention something? 
[00:52:00]  Oh, man, I'm getting it today.  Well, why?  What's going on?  You know, so that makes you think.  But I am not shocked that there could be things going on in any administration, Democrat, Republican, business, Walmart, whatever it is.  And we all blame the chief executive because everyone says, well, the buck stops here.  He should know.  He's the responsible.  Well, it's fancy to say that.  Yeah.  But in real life, you know, look at Jimmy Carter.  Everyone jumps on Jimmy Carter, and sometimes justifiably, because he never got the big picture. 
[00:52:30]  He was always detail.  He wanted to know every memo, what everyone's doing.  That's not what a chief executive should be doing.  Yeah, micromanaging everyone.  Yeah.  And I think that's happening.  So it's possible he didn't know.  I think he might have, but I wasn't there, so I don't know.  Yeah, I think if he knew anything, it was after the fact.  Like, I don't think he was in on the planning of this thing or knew about it before.  But he might have known, if he knew anything, I think he might have known something after. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, he might have an inkling after he was done that.  I think it does happen.  A chief executive does set a tone, and everyone wants to please their boss.  So if you've got a boss that normally goes around saying, I'll get that S.O.B., yeah, he's not going to, well, so all of a sudden you're sitting home saying, yeah, I've got an idea.  And he's going to really like me when you do this.  Yeah, he's going to love this one.  He's going to wink at me and say, nice going.  Yeah, right.  That's more likely how these things happen. 
[00:53:30]  I like your take on it.  Yeah, you kind of build that environment of, as they call him, a bully.  They call him a bully.  Yeah.  Well, I remember in my generation, it was Lyndon Johnson.  So you either, with admiration, said, boy, this guy was a wheelie dealer, but he got things done.  And then in today's age, you'd look at him and say, oh, my God, I think I was a crook.  This guy was a bully.  So it's, you know, we always want the tough guy when it's getting something done that we need. 
[00:54:00]  You know, Harry Truman, give him hell.  Yep.  And all that.  So we're fine.  You know, we want the toughness and the bullying when it's bullying something that we want.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  And if it's not, oh, that guy's a bully.  Well, this guy's a piece of shit.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Subpoenas are going out for people close to Christie.  So they're not letting it go.  Well, no.  And they're still trying to get to the bottom of the whole thing.  Well, that's why the guy at the top or the woman at the top gets in trouble. 
[00:54:30]  Mm-hmm.  Because, you know, at the end, they're going to go to someone really close to him and say, you know, they won't admit it, but they say, you know, you could be facing 15 years.  But, of course, if you cooperate.  Yeah, then they'll start yapping.  That's when this is going to get interesting.  Exactly.  That's when people start yapping.  That's the power.  And people are going to start yapping.  Yeah.  They're going to do a little yapping.  We've got a great question coming in for the Jerry Springer show itself.  Michael in Pennsylvania. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, Jerry.  Yes.  Silly question.  No, not silly.  Hey, is there some kind of contract that has to be signed for your guests that whenever the bell rings that they have to fight?  Or, you know, like when the audience chants for them to do something if they have to do it?  No.  Because a lot of times those people look like they don't want to do it and they're hesitating before they do it.  It is.  No, there's certainly nothing in the contract.  And they're not told they have to do it at all. 
[00:55:30]  Well, but anyone who is on the show has seen it a thousand times before.  Let's be honest.  First of all, the only way you can be on the show is if you call us.  Okay.  This isn't the kind of show where you could go out and recruit people.  You're not Shanghai and people.  No one would want to.  You know, 90% of America would never be on the show.  Me included.  But 10% would.  And 10% of America is 32 million people.  That's a lot of shows.  Sure.  So the people call us. 
[00:56:00]  So they've watched the show a thousand times before.  Therefore, they know the drill.  Right.  They know what happens.  You could get these.  I've always maintained you could get these same people.  And if they were on Oprah, let's say she was still in the air.  If they were on Oprah, they would behave perfectly.  Their language wouldn't be much better.  I mean, you know, but they wouldn't curse.  They wouldn't.  In other words, they wouldn't fight.  They wouldn't jump out of their seats.  So it's, they know the drill and they know when the bell goes. 
[00:56:30]  That's just like in a boxing match, you know.  I love that.  Yeah.  But no.  Ding, ding, ding.  And they just fucking swing at each other.  Was there ever a show where you went home feeling really kind of bad or depressed about  what you saw?  Well, no.  And if so, oh, okay.  No.  And I'll tell you why.  Yeah.  First of all, our show doesn't deal with any serious subjects.  We're dealing with people that, you know, their, their lover was out with someone else. 
[00:57:00]  And so they're angry.  That's real.  But the next day they're dating someone else.  So we don't deal with life and death situations.  Right.  It's a crazy circus.  So that's number one.  So I have to put in perspective.  Oh, come on.  There are things to be upset about.  But if someone's dating someone else, I don't get that upset.  We have wars going on.  Okay.  So that's the first thing.  And the second thing is these people are told ahead of time, very seriously, we're not  a serious show. 
[00:57:30]  If you do have a problem, don't come on it because we're not qualified to deal with it.  You let them know right away.  This is, you know what the show is.  It's a circus.  You want to be on it, be part of the circus.  Welcome.  Yeah.  But please don't come on here on the mistaken impression that I'm a doctor.  Yeah, that this is a shrink's couch.  And I, because I don't have a clue.  I mean, I know how I'd advise my own daughter, but that's just one parent to a child.  Right.  No longer a child.  But so.  And you can't know these people long enough to think you could make an assessment of 
[00:58:00]  their problems.  Well, no, it's almost disrespectful.  Right.  It's like, your problem is so trivial, you'll come to me, talk to me before the next commercial  break, and I will save your life.  Exactly.  But I asked that question because we kind of play in the same arena, obviously.  We're going for the same people, more or less.  And there was only one show that bothered the shit out of me after all these years.  And we've had some crazy stuff going on.  And it was the dumb gay off we did last year.  But that was more because it was just. 
[00:58:30]  It was horrific.  It was a bit.  I wasn't.  I didn't want to do to begin with.  Yeah.  But we ended up doing it.  Me and Ant were completely horrified what we were saying.  It was basically straight guys coming in and seeing how far they would go for money.  Oh, OK.  But here's the twist, Jerry.  Their wives and girlfriends are sitting right in the corner.  Oh.  And I saw one particular woman getting extremely upset.  And I'm like, this is so fucked up.  And we know if we didn't stop it, the guy would have done anything. 
[00:59:00]  He would have.  Jesus.  He would have went all the way.  Let's just put it that way.  Yeah.  And that didn't bother me that much, though.  Really?  It bothered me because it was just like disturbing to watch.  Yeah, it was.  It wasn't.  Like I didn't feel bad or anything.  That was the only time I ever felt really bad after I left this place.  I was like, man, that was pretty fucked up.  That was a fucked up.  Because you could see that the guy really needed money.  And at one point he tells his, I'm not sure if it's a wife or girlfriend.  He's like, no, you cannot tap out. 
[00:59:30]  Because the thing was the women could tap out when they felt like, all right, this is enough.  And this guy was basically telling her, don't, you're not tapping out.  Don't you do it.  Right.  That was the only time.  Because, you know, we see this as entertainment in the end.  So I'm not.  Yeah.  And I, and I, well, we go out of our way to let, first of all, I think I've said that the last time I was on.  When there's a surprise, you're given a list ahead of time of 21 possible surprises. 
[01:00:00]  And you have to agree to everyone, to the possibility of all 21 that you don't get on the show.  Now, so you don't know which of the 21 it's going to be, but you've already agreed that you're okay if it's any one of them.  You may get upset, but you're not going to say, I never would have said that on television.  Right, right.  So that is done away with.  So it's hard to go away feeling upset after they've said, look, if my guy is really a woman, let me know. 
[01:00:30]  It's on the paper.  Uh-oh.  Got another great question coming in.  Let's say hi to Rick in Texas.  Rick.  Yeah, I got a question for you.  Yep.  You're a, you're like a liberal Democrat, right?  Yes.  So you moved your show from Chicago to a Lexitati state.  Like, it doesn't make you the worst kind of piece of shit fucking ever in the world?  Uh, if it was my decision, yes.  It wasn't his question.  I wouldn't say in the world.  Uh-huh.  But, uh.  Because you're a fucking piece of shit, man.  Yeah.  Jerry.  I mean, Rick. 
[01:01:00]  But why, why did you fake your question?  We would have, oh, now he hangs up.  Yeah.  Well, anyway.  Just so you know, I mean, he faked his question.  Yeah.  He, what, it said, what do you feed these people backstage to make them act like they do on the  scale?  Yeah.  Which I thought was kind of a funny question.  Yeah.  And they're going, I've got to come up with a question.  We would have taken that, idiot, idiot.  We would have taken that phone call.  No problem.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But anyway, um, well, we don't, uh, feed them and they don't get fed unless they go out.  Get out there.  Yeah.  Plus you explain.  How are you going to say that?  Plus you explain that moving the show was a corporate decision. 
[01:01:30]  It wasn't going.  Yeah.  NBCUniversal moved us.  Yeah.  I, I was opposed to it and it was a big fight in the newspapers actually.  Mm-hmm.  Which is, I didn't want to move for exactly that reason.  In other words, there were people in Chicago that had these jobs.  Right.  And not all of them could move their families to Connecticut.  Uh-huh.  Right.  So, um, uh, it was a big fight.  There were meetings and finally we worked out a compromise where we could take the people  that could make the move from Chicago to Connecticut and that's what we did. 
[01:02:00]  But yeah, there, there, there was a big fight over that.  What the guy who just called didn't understand is that I was on his side.  Better language, but I was on his side.  Right.  And we were taking the call, buddy.  This piece of shit was on your side, sir.  Yeah.  And the other thing, Jerry, you've been on our show many, many times and I don't remember  you talking about this, but you, you worked at one time for Robert Kennedy.  Right.  When you were, you were 25 years old?  I was right out of law school.  And you were working for him when he was assassinated.  Yeah. 
[01:02:30]  Why haven't we ever talked about this?  Because you don't care.  No, I don't know.  What's your, I don't talk about everything in my life.  Uh, well, it was only a few months, obviously.  But still.  Yeah, it was, um, well, I've been very active in the civil rights movement and,  um, and then in the anti-war movement, this was 1968, 67, 68.  And, uh, a professor of mine was a friend of his.  And one day he was passing through Chicago and they were going to have dinner that night. 
[01:03:00]  And so I was invited to join him because at that time they were trying to get Senator  Kennedy to run against Johnson in the primaries.  And he didn't want to do it.  Hmm.  Um, primarily because Johnson had replaced his brother.  They never were on good terms.  And he didn't want to make it look like this was just a revenge, not revenge.  Johnson didn't do it.  But I mean, this white house belongs to the Kennedys.  And, you know, you shouldn't be president. 
[01:03:30]  My brother was killing.  So therefore I'm running.  I want it back for the Kennedy.  Right, right.  It just, there was a bad taste about it.  So he didn't want to do it.  But those of us who wanted out of Vietnam said, forget what you personally feel about  it.  You're the only one who has a chance of beating Johnson.  Right.  In the primaries.  And at that point it was pretty unheard of to run against the president of the United  States when he's of your own party and beat him in the primaries because he controlled  the political machinery.  So anyway, he says, why don't you join us for dinner? 
[01:04:00]  Because the Senator didn't need to hear some of this stuff because they were trying to convince  him to run.  While he was hesitating, Gene McCarthy stepped up and he ran in the primaries.  Eventually Bobby did come in and run.  But you had dinner with him?  I went to, well, yeah, but a lot of people, you know.  That's pretty cool though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, he was, to this day, he was the most significant political person I ever  met, always associated with.  Yeah.  He was great. 
[01:04:30]  He was great.  But again, it was a short time job, obviously.  Yeah.  He was killed in June.  Damn.  Jinxed the whole thing, Jerry.  Yeah.  Brought you on board.  But for that dinner.  What happened there?  Oh, boy.  Last time someone's had dinner with me.  Don't take a dinner with Jerry.  Where were you when he was assassinated?  Coincidentally, I was in Cincinnati, having nothing to do with what became my job then.  Ah.  But I literally, because my job at the time for Kennedy was to, there were six or seven 
[01:05:00]  states where I would go into college campuses to get the McCarthy kids to switch over to  Bobby for the Democratic Convention.  Because back then the kids were, even though originally they would have been for Kennedy, they were upset that  Kennedy was stalling and not running.  And Gene McCarthy stepped up.  So all these kids then cut their hair.  Back then the slogan was, get clean for Gene.  Wow.  Well, because, you know, we were all hippies with hair down to our shoulders, et cetera, and 
[01:05:30]  all that.  And, but the way to beat Johnson was not to beat a hippie because they, back then in the  60s, they thought, you know, they'll rip the country apart.  Uh-huh.  So we all cut our hair, you know, all the McCarthy kids and had crew cuts and really  cleaned up and went to New Hampshire door to door.  And even though McCarthy didn't win in New Hampshire, he got so close that the election  was on Tuesday, March 12th of 68.  On Wednesday, Bobby Kennedy, they catch him coming out of the office at the Senate office 
[01:06:00]  building.  He says, I'm reassessing.  Hmm.  And then on that Saturday, March 16th, he announces.  So then he was again called ruthless, opportunistic.  You're only getting in because now McCarthy showed that, uh, Johnson was vulnerable.  Um, and clearly that was part of the reason, but it was also a significant part of his,  of the equation that he was considering.  Why get in the race if there's no chance to be the same president?  Right.  Why wouldn't you use that information and say, okay. 
[01:06:30]  So he did get in and then he won all the next primaries except, uh, Oregon.  And, and, but then the final night he won California.  And then when he, right after the acceptance speech, Oh, we all know what happened there.  Don't go through the kitchen.  That's fascinating.  Yeah.  So there's a, is there a picture online of you with long hair?  We're going to, we're going to try to find it right now.  I got to see Jerry Springer.  There was one, one, I probably was, I mean, it wasn't so long as, Oh, cause that was back  in college, probably, or law school. 
[01:07:00]  Probably not.  But even when I was mayor, it was kind of long.  Yeah.  I was, there's one anti-nuke rally.  Oh yeah.  They showed this picture.  Well, it's reasonably long.  You went to the anti-nuke rallies?  Well, I led them.  Yeah.  Wow.  I mean, I was really a hippie.  Let's say hi to Jason.  Well, we haven't been nuked.  That's true.  Jerry.  So pretty good.  I don't want to take all the credit.  You make a valid point.  I don't want to take all the credit.  Jason in Philly.  Jason.  Hey, what's up guys?  Hey.  You know, big fan, long time listener, Jerry. 
[01:07:30]  Huge honor to talk to you.  Thank you.  You know, being in politics, I'm wondering how corrupt is politics?  I'm a college student.  They always say politics is corrupt, but is politics as corrupt as they say?  Um, it's not, look, there are tens of thousands of people in politics, people holding offices,  local, state, federal, um, people that work for them.  So you've got a population, let's say, of 50,000 people that have political jobs in America. 
[01:08:00]  Are some of them absolutely corrupt?  Of course.  Just like if you got 50,000 dentists, you'd find some that are not paying their taxes or  doing something shady or whatever.  So the answer is, yeah, there's some that are, um, where most of the dishonesty comes  in though, is not in the stealing of money and that kind of thing.  It, it's the intellectual dishonesty.  It's what happens is you're in politics and let's say you're in elective office and you've  been elected five terms in a row. 
[01:08:30]  You're now in your mid forties.  This has been basically the one job you've had as a grownup for 20 years and you've got  a family and the next election is important to win because you're trying to put food on  the table for your own family.  And if you're suddenly out of a job at 45, you've got to join the masses in trying to find the job.  So the reality is people in office often talk themselves into saying and doing what seems most 
[01:09:00]  popular at the time because they have to win the next election because that is their livelihood,  not just their economic livelihood, but also the way they see themselves, their emotional, uh,  livelihood.  In other words, this is their life.  It's their career.  It's their career.  And you don't want to blow it.  And so it's very easy to say, well, I'm really not for this issue, but I can only help people  if I get reelected and therefore I'm willing to compromise a little bit on this issue if  it gets me reelected and you keep compromising one after another. 
[01:09:30]  It's always a little bit.  And before you know it, you've sold out.  That's the corruption that takes place in policy.  Do you think term limits are, uh, an answer to that?  No, I don't like term limits, even though it goes against what I just, in other words,  term limits would cure that problem, but we have a democracy and people have the right  to have whatever leaders they choose.  And I don't think we should falsely say, let's say during the time of, you know, and I keep 
[01:10:00]  saying I'm a Democrat, let's say during the time of Reagan, if people wanted Reagan for  another term or if people wanted Clinton for another term, why should they not be allowed  to make that choice?  Now, now maybe people would have, I think in both cases, they might have said no.  Right.  But if a person wants to run, let the public decide if they're happy with this leadership,  they're happy with it or they're not.  I don't think you need to put a limit on it.  I think there's a comfort factor that comes into play though, where people will vote for  somebody just because they've been in the office for so long. 
[01:10:30]  That used to be the case, but I, nowadays, frankly, incumbency is not a plus because you  get so ripped up when you're in office.  I mean, really, by your second term, why do you, you know, so I don't know that it's  an advantage anymore.  I really don't.  I think if you're the outsider, you've got the advantage.  Yeah, that's true.  Well, let's, let's make sure people know about Jerry's new show.  Absolutely.  It's called Tabloid.  It's premiering tonight at 10 o'clock on Investigation Discovery. 
[01:11:00]  Nine o'clock Central Time.  Anything else about the show, Jerry?  I hope we, I want to make sure we sell it properly for you.  You are such a good salesman.  We're trying.  Yeah.  We're trying.  Here's what I, here's what I, I didn't know, but Investigation Discovery, the whole network,  it's like number four of any network for women.  Wow.  Really?  Yeah, they told, I didn't know that.  They love watching those shows.  These are crime shows.  And people stick with it all evening, yeah. 
[01:11:30]  I love that one.  It's a good show.  I love the show.  I do.  I watch so many shows.  Well, you're a girl.  On that.  Yeah, yeah.  I've been called on.  We're home during the day, so, yeah.  Oh, it's great.  I watch New Jersey Housewives.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  And Beverly Hills Housewives.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  You watch them going on.  Wonderful.  The guy called back.  Rick.  Yeah.  We would have taken your call.  I got cut off.  I swear to God we didn't hang up on you.  I got cut off.  I called back.  All right. 
[01:12:00]  You know what?  Jack, you're talking about the corruption of politics?  Okay.  You made a good point about being elected four or five times.  Isn't that a great argument for term limits?  So we don't have career politicians in there for 40 years?  You think they're royalty.  You do bathroom deals.  And sit there and fuck the populace?  Yes, it is.  Okay, I'll answer.  Okay, easy.  I'll answer you.  Hey, Rick.  Why are you so hostile?  Yeah, where's all this anger coming from, Rick?  Where all the haters coming from is, you know, I'm working more, I'm making less, my fucking 
[01:12:30]  bills are skyrocketing because fucking Obama has skyrocketed everything.  Well, that's what I figured it was about.  Okay, I understand, but it seems like you're...  Hold on, Rick.  Hey, easy.  Rick, Rick, Rick.  You're going to be okay.  I swear you made your point.  I understand, but why...  Sounds like a guest on your show, Jerry.  Yeah, but why the anger toward Jerry Springer about all this?  Because Jerry's a very political person who comes out as a major fucking liberal who pushes  all this shit. 
[01:13:00]  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  You're going to be okay.  We don't have to hate each other.  I happen to disagree with you about Obama, but that's all right.  That doesn't make you a bad person, and honestly, it doesn't make me a bad person.  Okay.  Yeah.  Oh, there you go.  Okay.  Good.  All right.  Now you feel better.  I think Jerry explained the term limit thing, saying that it should just be left to the American  people.  He's right.  This guy is right in terms that would solve that particular problem. 
[01:13:30]  But as is true in life as well as politics, you could solve one problem, but then create  another problem which isn't good.  I agree it would solve the problem of career politicians.  But there's a bigger issue, and the bigger issue is in a democracy, shouldn't people have  the right to choose who they want?  So, for example, this fellow who's calling up is really angry that Obama is president.  But most of the people who voted wanted Obama to be president, and they wanted him to be 
[01:14:00]  president.  Most of the people.  Just as him.  And let me finish.  Let me finish.  And a lot of dead people voted.  Okay.  I know.  A lot of dead people.  It was unbelievable.  You should have been to some of those rallies of the dead people.  It was great.  It was great, except it smelled a lot.  Now, there were a lot of people who didn't like the fact that Bush was elected president  and thought, oh, my God, you know, here we have these wars.  I was one of them, too.  Yeah.  Okay.  And they get upset.  So you're always going to have people that are upset with the result of an election. 
[01:14:30]  But God bless America, because we all get a vote, and more people chose someone, so live  with it, you know?  You'll have another election, and vote for a Republican next time.  That's a good way to sugarcoat it.  But look, if you take out, you know, the fact that they can keep going over and over and  over and over again, getting reelected, you know, there should be term limits on it.  So there is an influence battling.  And once you're voted out of office or retired, you shouldn't be able to get a fucking lobbying 
[01:15:00]  job to put your influence in Washington, D.C.  I agree with you.  We're on the same side on that issue.  Let's have a meeting.  You and I.  We agree.  We agree.  If you tone the language down a bit, I'm really with you.  I'm sorry.  Jerry's finger's never heard the word fuck.  I have heard it.  He's got you there.  No, I have heard it.  But normally, it isn't directed at me.  So I'm okay.  It's okay. 
[01:15:30]  You seem so hostile towards me.  And I'm just, I don't know you.  I'm, we're just having a discussion.  We can disagree.  It's the same thing I tell the people on the show.  You're not making your point by screaming at me.  I disagree with you.  But also, I want to get my point out there, because, you know, that's how I feel.  Okay, hold on a minute.  I respect that.  I'm going to show you Jerry's point, because now we got Laura on with you, Rick.  Laura's in Michigan.  Go ahead, Laura.  Hey, Jerry.  It's a real honor to speak to you. 
[01:16:00]  I want to say you are not a piece of shit.  I love your political views.  Thank you.  And I love how you handled that guy.  I mean, I want to channel you the next time I ever run into somebody who wants to spew their venom.  I just want to channel you.  Where in Michigan are you?  What, are you going to stalk her?  I don't know.  What's the point?  No, no, no.  Where in Michigan are you?  Oh, please stalk me.  Please stalk me.  I live in Richmond, which is a very conservative town.  They fly Confederate flags. 
[01:16:30]  And they play Sweet Home Alabama at the football games.  I fucking hate it.  Oh, okay.  Well, you know, maybe you should just go back and burn your American flag and, you know, and do it that way.  Good boy.  The thing about it is, I go through Detroit every fucking day.  You know, that's one city that I know that fucking the unions and the Democrats have fucking destroyed.  They've taken the jewel of fucking industry and turned it into fucking Beirut.  Which, thankfully, was saved by Barack Obama, President of the United States. 
[01:17:00]  Thank you for saving the auto industry, Mr. President.  Thank you so much.  Look, these two people are screaming at each other.  Thank you.  Oh, me, $10 billion.  Ding, ding, ding, ding.  This is how I do my show.  I don't have to do anything.  We want you to feel at home, Jerry.  Oh, yeah.  All of a sudden.  Obama wrote it off, so fuck you.  Yeah.  Oh, that's polite.  Oh, wow.  Is that how you talk to your wife?  Do you talk to women like that? 
[01:17:30]  Hey, Jerry's going to go bankrupt again because they didn't go through the right thing.  Who is this guy?  I don't know, but.  This guy, this guy needs meds, I'm telling you.  Barack Obama did not destroy Detroit.  No, he saved it at the end.  I love Detroit.  Yeah, she knows more about it than you do, sir, but thanks anyway.  They say that love is a gentle thing, but it's only brought me pain for the only girl I ever loved who's gone on that midnight train. 
[01:18:00]  I never will marry, I'll take me no wine.  He's still going.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right, Rick.  I think I've had it with these two.  Thank you, Rick.  Thank you for calling, ma'am. 
[01:18:30]  Thank you, Laura, from Michigan.  That was nice.  All right, Jerry, we've got to take a break.  Jerry, again, always a pleasure to have you in.  You guys are great.  Continued success, the new show, of course, Tabloid premiering tonight, and that is on Investigation Discovery at 10, 9 Central.  And Jerry Springer on Twitter.  Yes.  Yes, go follow Jerry, all right?  I'm on Twitter?  Apparently so.  Really?  I felt good.  I retweeted you yesterday because I thought you tweeted that.  Yeah, I'm sure it was me. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, wow.  Awkward.  Yeah, how do you do that?  Oh, wow, that sucks.  I thought I had a celebrity friend on Twitter.  No, we're friends.  We are, all right.  Oh, yeah.  It said that you were excited to do the Opie and Anthony show.  I saw that.  I'm like, oh, we're excited, too, Jerry.  Oh, well, that's true.  Oh, now I know how that happens.  No, let me tell you how that happens.  We talk in the morning, but I don't know that that's for tweeting.  Oh, okay.  And then they tweet something?  Yeah.  Oh, I mean, really?  I'm a CEO.  He delegates responsibility. 
[01:19:30]  Well, no, this is true.  We go over the schedule, what tomorrow is.  Do you want to do this?  Do you want to do that?  You know, what was it, a few days ago?  And I said, hell, yeah, we do that.  Yeah.  So that's how that happens.  But I don't actually do the tweeting.  Physically tweet it.  I know I should.  I got to get one of those.  You should.  What do you call them, L-phones?  I-phones.  Come on, Jerry.  You're only 70.  That's not that old.  Get a smart.  You don't have a smartphone, do you?  How smart am I?  You really don't have, like, an iPhone, or what do you got?  If you pull out a flip phone. 
[01:20:00]  Jerry, come on, Jerry.  There you go.  Jerry, come on.  I'm like the jitterbug.  You know what you can do with a phone now?  It's exciting.  What?  Get in trouble.  All sorts of apps.  Yeah.  Jerry would be sexting and get in trouble.  Oh, snap.  We'll Snapchat.  You can do that?  Oh, that was it.  Jerry, what are you doing with the flip phone?  I love it.  What are you doing, Jerry?  I love it.  What's the point?  It's got a 1997.  It looked like a jitterbug.  You're not that old yet, Jerry.  Come on.  Nothing wrong.  All right. 
[01:20:30]  All right.  Is there an app for Lawrence Welk?  I don't think there's a Lawrence Welk app, but you should get to work on that.  If they have one, I'm getting it.  Did you like Lawrence Welk?  That's the show.  Well, my parents watched it.  Okay.  All right.  My parents watched it.  That's really.  My parents watched it.  My mom loved Lawrence Welk.  Lawrence Welk with him for a while.  I'll tell you what.  What a snooze fest.  I'll tell you what I love is when I was a kid, I loved Gunsmoke.  Gunsmoke was good.  And I am now watching, unlike, what is that, Encore Westerns on cable. 
[01:21:00]  So you can see, like, late in the afternoon, they have all the old Gunsmoke.  Gunsmoke, so now my assistant found on the Internet, you can get all the old shows, because it was on for 20 years.  Yeah, 20 years.  So I ordered 20 years of Gunsmoke.  My grandson and I, we sit and watch together.  This is going to be great.  I am sad for them.  Can I blow your mind now?  Yes.  You can watch Gunsmoke on your phone, Jerry. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, man.  What?  You can watch it on your phone.  Well, not yours, of course.  On those L phones, iPhones?  L phone, a P phone, a phone.  You've got to get, when you're bored, you can throw a Gunsmoke episode on, you'd be in heaven.  But then what happens if someone's calling you?  Who cares?  Does it interrupt?  No one uses their phones to call people.  I hate when it interrupts when I'm watching.  Who calls?  Who calls?  You don't use this to call anyone?  Well, then why do they call it a phone?  That's a good point.  We don't know.  That is a good point.  They're going to get rid of the phone part and just call it smart. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  Because it is, I mean, I do, it is hard to carry around, Mike.  I have a computer.  It's hard to carry that around a little bit.  He has all the time.  I can only imagine.  Just trying to text with a tower system.  Just carrying a tower system around.  And then I've got to find a plug someplace or a socket, Jerry.  It's horrible.  All right.  Jerry, thanks so much.  Jerry Springer, the legend.  Always a pleasure, Jerry.  We'll see you soon.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks, guys.

[01:26:30]  When he throws a celebration for himself  Tequila Day was my idea  But when things go wrong  E-Rock gets personal  I can come with a woman  You can't  And the things that usually help  No longer do the trick  Maybe I need a donut  Humiliating his friends, family, and his wife  I didn't grab her tits, no  I don't think she's proud of this  Of this particular show  Then, insulting his radio idol 
[01:27:00]  Oh, turn it off  Give your final sign-off  Go home, no one needs you  E-Rock's years of radio training go down the drain  9.08, 8 in  Try it again  9.08, 8 minutes after 8 o'clock  Just like a chandelier  I'm hooked on the ceiling  Here's hooked on a feeling  And awful cliches are used improperly  A lot to go home  We may get the truth  And I know, I know  That he doesn't like me  But when humiliation sets in 
[01:27:30]  The sex man's emotions become out of control  I don't even know that I'm crying  Sexy B learns a lesson the hard way  Next week on a very special Opie and Anthony show  Morning BJs  And now, back to the show  That's a new show  Aren't you glad you didn't drive off that bridge?

[01:38:00]  Running parallel  Yeah  Because it's  Literally  You hear him  In the middle of the night  And you know  The pacifier fell out  And you gotta go over  And put that  Cork in its mouth  But then you're like  Oh fuck  What did I do  Oh man  I used to sleep  Until 12  And then you walk over  And then he looks up  At you with these  Little tired eyes  And then he smiles  And you're like  This little motherfucker  I made this with jizz  You know what I mean  I can't believe  He's looking at me  It is weird  You make children with jizz 
[01:38:30]  Jizz  It really is strange  To think I threw jizz away  Like I was on a Mardi Gras  Float my whole life  Just flicking it on walls  And pillows  And chicks' backs  Thinking of all the  Beautiful little bobbies  That I've thrown  Right  Away  And now  I look at this kid  And they grow so fast  And they  You know  It's just  How old is he now?  Seven and a half  Already  Wow  We still have something for him  I forgot you were coming  I forgot you were coming in today  I couldn't have just handed it to you 
[01:39:00]  It's funny too  All the stuff that people give you  It's like  You know what you should give people?  Diapers  Just give them diapers  Yeah  Diapers  And baby wipes  Right  Don't give me sneakers  Because  He doesn't  He's not going to walk for two years  Don't spend the money  Don't give me  Don't give me anything else  Don't give me a onesie  Don't give me the freaking pacifier  With the mustache  How many of those did you get?  Oh  A couple  And every time  Oh this is so boring  Look how funny this is  Look he's a little baby with a mustache  We were  They did it once 
[01:39:30]  And that was it  My daughter doesn't do the pacifier  What?  How fucked up is that?  No way  My son was all about it  I mean that was a little late too  That was getting a little  A little comfortable for everybody  Yeah that's that  Let me tell you how uncomfortable  When you're sitting on the couch  And he grabs your thumb  And it actually  You're like  Why does this feel good?  Oh my god  You're like  No I'm kidding  That's funny  It's this  But it's this  It's not a sexual  It's weird that kids take away 
[01:40:00]  The sexual thing of everything  It's all gone  Like you don't look at  You change your kid  It's not a ding ding  It's just his  You know  You got his little pay you  You got to clean it  You got to make sure  The circumcision is nice  Oh god  And pull his little helmet back  So it doesn't stick  So you don't get a Colin Quinn dick  You know  I clean a vagina every day  Yeah I don't know  I clean a vagina every day  That is beyond bizarre  No one  No one like  Sat me down  And told me about that  I just assumed  It would be whatever 
[01:40:30]  It's really strange  Did you ever go  Back to front by accident  And fill a vagina with poop?  Oh all that  Yeah  You have to  You learn by doing  What the hell is going on?  But every day  I'm cleaning a baby vagina  I mean when you wrap  Your head around that  It's bizarre  It's bizarre  But it's not  Oh not sexual whatsoever  It just goes out the window  Of course  But it's still strange  It's really strange man  It's crazy  That they  I can't believe  That I 
[01:41:00]  Am a dad  Like if you look back  20s  And my 30s  We all can't believe  Yeah I get it though  No that's just a stupid joke  Cause you  I always saw you as a father  I know  I'm good with kids  I'm cool  I get it  Like I can't believe  You have an animal  In your house  Oh little beavis  Yeah but it's all I want  Cause I could fucking leave  He loves the beavis too  Little beavis great  He is a cool guy  He tries to downplay it  But he's really into it  I love the little guy  He's so much fun 
[01:41:30]  But I could just dump out  Some fucking food  Make sure the water's fucking there  And then hightail it to Atlantic City  For an entire weekend  You can do that with a kid too  You just gotta get a Mexican  And a kid  Right  Exactly  You know what I mean  There really is ways around it  I know there's ways around it  But I don't want ways around it  I want  Complete freedom  To go  Oh we're going  Yep  I'm out the fucking door  Right  You think about complete freedom  But I don't miss complete freedom  I don't miss it  I think about it from time to time 
[01:42:00]  Of course that's normal  But I don't  When you walk in the door  And your kid's there  And then you see his head perk up  And when you come in  And he does that bobble thing  Because he gets so excited  That he can't hold his head right  And then he has to  His head just collapses  In your wife's shoulder  Because he's so excited  He doesn't know how to deal  With excitement  And he giggles  You're like  There's no  There's no  I used to get annoyed  When husbands would be like  I miss my kid  Well what about your wife dummy  Of course you miss your wife  But there's something about your kid 
[01:42:30]  That is  Pretty special  Fucking phenomenal  Wait till the kid walks around all day  Just yelling daddy  I'm at that stage with my daughter  I see  Daddy daddy daddy  I turn around  And she's just showing me  Some ridiculous dumb thing  Yeah great  And then I turn back around  And she starts all over again  All day long  Imagine being the guy  That just turns around  And goes  Shut the fuck up  Well  She's creating a problem  Well that's the sad part  There certainly are people  Out there like that  That's what I can't get  Now that I have a kid  And I remember my second stepdad 
[01:43:00]  You know  Him punching me  In like second grade  I'm like  How the fuck  Could you  Even think  About hitting a kid  Like these people  Who abuse their kids  I don't get it  The kids  Kids are so fucking  I'm surprised  There's not more babies  With like  Bite marks  In the hospital  Like in the emergency room  Like accidental  Accidental  I'm sorry  I just get his  Fucking cute face  I can't take it  Sometimes  Yeah  I'm with you on that  I get really mad

[01:48:00]  I'm going to give you two things  That I think people should tell you  And they don't  One thing they tell you  Is get your sleep  That's idiotic  Because you could sleep  For three months straight  When the kid comes  You're still fucked  You're done  You know  You should learn  To live without sleep  Go hang out with Navy SEALs  Right now  Yeah  Learn how to stay up for nine days  Okay  Go on a mission  That's a great point  In Afghanistan  Yeah  Okay  That's what you need  Don't get your sleep  Lose your sleep  That is hilarious  Because everyone says  Get your sleep now 
[01:48:30]  Yeah  Yeah  And you  You're like  I want to strangle them  Every time I hear that  Yeah please  Don't do  Tell them to go fuck themselves  Stay up for three days  Go on a hunger strike  Yeah seriously  Go on a hunger strike  I want you to take all your shirts  And I want you to spit  And jizz on them  Right on the shoulders  Right  Okay  I can do that  I can definitely do that  Here's another thing  Throw everything you care about  In the mud  Do that now  Yeah  Do that now  And then I want you to  Take your finger  And stick it in your ass 
[01:49:00]  And wipe it under your nose  And get used to that smell  Right  Okay  This sounds like a slow Tuesday for me  Okay  And get the first one out of the way  Take a brick  And throw it at your flat screen TV  Yeah  Just so you understand the feeling  Of when that happens for real  Yeah  I had to replace a huge flat screen TV  Oh  Because my son decided to practice T-ball  In the living room one day  With a really hard  I can't  It was a yellow hard ball  With like a bell  Like a  Like a  Like a  Like a thing in the middle 
[01:49:30]  Jingle bell in the middle  Like a jingle bell-ish thing in the middle  And he fucking smacked the line drive  Right into my nice flat screen  I'd love that  And here's the last thing I'll tell you  You ready?  You ready?  Yes  Stop playing with your balls  You don't know  Listen  How am I supposed to stop playing with my balls?  Listen  One day your wife's gonna go  Can you hold the baby?  Cause  And you're gonna grab the kid  And you're gonna look up  He's gonna be sucking on your fucking knuckle  And you forgot that you've been playing with your balls  And taint for the last 30 minutes  And he's gonna look like he just ate hot sauce 
[01:50:00]  And his upper lip's gonna be swollen  Okay?  Cause he's allergic to your asshole  And balls  So stop  Listen to me  Stop playing with your balls  Unless you want to fucking wash your hands every 30 seconds  Oh god  I'm not ready for any of this  But thanks guys  Have a great day  It's gonna be awesome dude  You're gonna love it  How often would you have your hand literally down the front of your pants though Bobby?  Playing with your balls  Here's the thing dude  You don't realize it 
[01:50:30]  But you're watching TV  And you fix your nuts  Or you fix your junk  Or you move your balls  Or you just play with your little Chinese relaxation nuts  While you're watching the game on Sunday  Hey give it a little  A little how you doing  And you forget you have a kid dude  Your life flips the fuck upside down  In one day  And all of a sudden  And she's like  Can you hold the baby for a second?  And you're like  Yeah  Yeah  Give me the kid  And then he's just sitting there  But you're watching TV  And then he starts sucking on your finger  And you're like  Oh  Where's that finger been?  Oh no  Boy  I mean  You try to wash your hands a lot 
[01:51:00]  But then there's a point where you're like  I'm done  Fuck you  Have a second kid  And you realize all that washing stuff is nonsense  Yeah  You fucking pick up the pacifier  It has like a piece of gum from a homeless guy  You take it off  You fucking throw it in the kid's mouth  But for the first kid  That pacifier hits the floor  All of a sudden  You're like putting it in boiling water for ten minutes  Yeah  Second kid  You just wipe it on your fucking pants leg  And throw it back in  Yeah  You learn he needs a little sidewalk aids  Just to get his immune system up  You know what I mean  Oh fuck  Do you get sick a lot because of your kid? 
[01:51:30]  No  My kid got sick once  Once so far  Which is  That's pretty good  It's awful  Let's say hi to Keith  Keith  I got something that's going to gross Anthony out before it does Bobby this time  Bobby  Think about your kid  If he has trouble breathing right now  And the only way to unstuck his nose  Is to suck the boogie out with your mouth  What are you going to do?  I'm not afraid of boogers  I don't know if you guys know this  But I used to pick my nose  You're going to suck him out with your mouth  To get him to breathe again  You're going to suck him out  And suck the boogie out  To get him out  You would laugh at that 
[01:52:00]  That's easy  When I was a kid  I used to pick my nose and eat it  That was my thing  That was my thing  It was  I used to do this  Right here  Look  I know it's bad for radio  But I used to put my two middle finger  And whatever that fucking finger is  What is this finger by the way?  The ring finger  The ring finger  The middle finger  In my mouth  Like that  And then put my finger on the nose  Put my pinky in my nose  Roll it around  Get a big booger  Make it into a little ball  And then roll it on my upper lip  Yeah why are they rolling it on the upper lip?  The fuck is wrong with you?  What is that? 
[01:52:30]  He's told us before  Why?  I remember that  I don't know  Why on the upper lip?  Because it was nice and a smooth surface  Like a  You're teasing your mouth with all that goodness  Oh god damn it  Why would you tease your mouth with the goodness?  Opie's a connoisseur  No I've slowed down  Have you slowed down on books?  Yeah  I just  My nose is always itchy  But now that you said that  Now I'm kind of itching my nose  Ah  You tease your mouth with all the goodness  The crunchiness  And the saltiness  Of a booger chip 
[01:53:00]  Yeah fuck sea salt  I know sea salt's all the rage  But you're making your own sea salt right there  Hey get one out  Throw it on there  Right in the middle of an omelet  Right  Alright well  We haven't seen Bobby in a while  And you know  I want an update on the kid thing  Yeah it's pretty crazy  I find it fascinating  It's great  Because it really does change your whole outlook on life  I say it this way  Something turns on in your brain 
[01:53:30]  That you didn't realize was there  Yeah you don't have a choice  When that kid pops out  All of a sudden there's something that just turns on in the brain  Yeah  You become a better person just automatically  But  Gee  But the thing is too  I thought I was going to change sexually  Like I was going to stop being a deviant  Like I was going to stop  Uh huh  All of a sudden I was going to like  You know softcore  You know Cinemax porn  Cinemax  Like I would  But you know  Nine days  And all of a sudden  You know  Once you realize that the kid can't see 
[01:54:00]  Into what you jerk off to  Right  Yeah  Like there's that moment where you think like  He's going to know what's in my mind  But he can't  So then you go back to cranking it out  That's when you know you're a creep  When you jerk off in the same area as a kid's toy  And you don't  Yeah  You don't even move it  You just jerk around it  Oh god  And then just assume you didn't hit it  Oh my god  Yeah because  You know the tub used to be my place of 
[01:54:30]  You know I used to  It used to be almost like a Thai jungle  And I would  You know I had logs  I could put my legs up  And women  Asian women would come from behind  And clean me from behind  And the rainfall  The waterfall would come down  Sure  I'd get blown and tickled from behind  Nice image  Now there's just you know  There's a tub  There's a fucking  A green turtle  Some type of fucking floaty  Ducky thing  That tells you what temperature the water is  Oh yeah  I'm a bath guy as well

[01:55:30]  Your dick pops up and hits a fucking ducky  Your dick is like a piece of wood in the river  In the Hudson  You can't  I don't like tubs  Because first of all  They don't  You'd have to get a really big tub to fit in it  And your knee sticks out  And your dick pops out  And your tip of your cock is cold  And your knee is cold  You're losing weight  You're gonna be ready for a tub soon enough  Yeah but even you though  You're a big guy  I mean you're tall  You're not gonna fit in the tub  I don't know  I feel like I do though  Your shoulders are out

[02:31:30]  fucking bad my brother's reminding me of our three story high tree fort yeah because we had to go  really high to get the the trees to line up so we could finally build our tree fort it was so  ridiculously high off the ground it was scary and then part of it we used what like you said  whatever you could find and we had rotting wood and we just knew you couldn't really stand in this  one part of the tree oh no but it just looked cool that we had the whole floor done 
[02:32:00]  and we couldn't replace it because we couldn't find any fucking we couldn't find any other lumber  depending on who your friends were you had the guy that was willing to fucking put a two by four  over his shoulder and climb to a dizzying height with a mouthful of nails and a fucking  like he's the guy and then you had the little shithead that was just a dope that you used to just  throw him the bent nails to straighten out on a rock it's like here take this rock and straighten  the bent nails out and hand it to someone that knows what they're doing hey asshole i was that 
[02:32:30]  guy i swear to god i had a fucking straighten the fucking nail i had to straighten out the nails and  you had to do it on a rock and then there was the engineer the designer that actually designed told  the maniac that was willing to do anything all right put that two by four there and then once  you got the two by fours across and you were able to span it with a couple of uh planks right uh  then you're in then you're in now everyone can get up there and start working just picture of poor  little ope sweating uh over a rock just fucking banging a nail with a rock on another rock right 
[02:33:00]  because you know you needed the hammer to actually do the real man you had a pit in your hand because  you knew you had to like get close to your hand to get the i know it all you didn't know that was me  nails cost nothing oh just go in and just grab a fistful and leave i know you're trying to build  something with every nail looked like a pig dick fucking i think it was illegal when we were  growing up to sell nails to kids maybe i have a feeling that maybe that was able to do that just

[02:40:00]  the people we didn't the um this book this guy this the vinnie totorich the angriest trainer  he wrote a book called uh fitness confidentials and it's just all about uh food i here's the thing  is every time i lost weight i did it by weight watchers and all those types of things some diet  where i starved myself or i didn't eat certain things and i just you know for a certain time and  i worked out like a fucking animal yeah which sucked because i'm not an athlete i you know i don't 
[02:40:30]  want to go to the gym six days a week i'm that's not me and then the problem is as soon as you lose  all the weight you're you're done with let's call it let's say it was weight watchers yeah and you're  done with the gym too because like you said it's not your thing and of course you're going to go back  up of course you haven't learned anything but you go back up really fast i can put on i can put on  weight real quick too yeah and real fast like abnormally fast but this it's like you kind of take  yourself out of the game it's like i'm not playing i'm not on a diet i'm just not eating sugar 
[02:41:00]  and i'm not eating grain ever in the rest of your life and you know what i i eat everything else i  eat the steaks eggs and bacon all that shit that they told you i'm eating the way people ate a hundred  years ago oh man like when they had you know in in on counters where no negroes are sitting next to you  i'm having shoe fly pie at the front of the restaurant  so no processed food i don't they corn that corn syrup and front corn fructose and all that bullshit 
[02:41:30]  you what you told me something about corn uh syrup ignite in the 1950s they had so overabundance of  corn so they learned how to put it in other things and they made corn fructose and all this shit so  everything you have has sugar in it you don't even know when i quit sugar and i'm talking i ketchup  has is like a sugar bomb you put you have a hamburger with even without the bun but you have ketchup  it's like having a snickers bar on the fucking thing you don't even know it yeah and you get 
[02:42:00]  addicted to ketchup you get it like i have to have ketchup so once i quit sugar i went through with i went  through a withdrawal three weeks in i was going through like the dt's jeez i'm fucking blue because  like i told you when i quit smoking two years ago i said i'm going to get fat i told her i can't do  this i said in my head i'll lose weight when i'm done with cigarettes so now it's like i was ready  to do it but i just couldn't do it this time because i couldn't do the gym i couldn't i couldn't 
[02:42:30]  i couldn't do diets and then i talked to this guy and i got this book and i learned about once i learned  about food and there's a few uh netflix documentaries you can watch too but once i learned about food once  i got this book and i talked to this guy he was a nonchalant to like you don't have to go to the  fucking gym it's all bullshit it's 90 diet it's what you put in your body you fat fuck yeah fat  fuck from new york so but it's um yeah i i quit i'm just out of the game so what do you put on i'm

[02:45:00]  the sugar out and the grains and the and then the flowers your body works the it it is something  internal that happens and you're not hungry because you're eating fat so i have the egg yolk and i have  maybe bacon or whatever and the fat i'm not hungry for hours i'm not hungry all day like i have to  remind myself to eat because the fat goes in your it does what it's supposed to do right as an animal 
[02:45:30]  you suppose it makes you full when you when you cook with pam and egg whites and yeah it's healthy i  guess but then you're hungry in 20 minutes and you're fighting that thing that's what killed me because  i'm an addict more not more so am i a fatty but i'm an addict so you'd be hungry and be like i'm  gonna fucking eat so i'm fighting that all the time and you're gonna fail one day something bad's  gonna happen in life i i went through thanksgiving didn't bother me because i can have turkey  i can have all the crazy shit i have vegetables vegetables are fucking magic fruit when you give

[03:07:30]  dead dad dad bob kelly in studio playing bananas hasbrook heights hasbrook heights new jersey  uh tomorrow and saturday go see bobby my god you working in a lot of kids stuff um yeah i'm  starting to write all the kids stuff you know it took a while because you i you creativity everything  freezes everything's done when you have the kid yeah and it's almost like you start to unthaw 
[03:08:00]  as the kid starts to sleep and be cool and you have to worry about it dying and its dick falling off  good you know you nailed it yeah i feel like i'm coming out of the the deep freeze yeah all right  i had a tough time doing this radio show for a while yeah a tough time and i'm finally breathing  again yeah it's like you start to thaw out and right become that guy you were because all your focus is  like you know yeah making sure everything is going all right yeah make sure the kid don't die oh yeah 
[03:08:30]  exactly and it's it's literally that and make sure you don't you you get so i have so much anxiety  now that i don't have vices i took away my vices and then when you have a kid the  anxiety goes through the roof and my wife is one of those people she's like he's fine he's fine  check his temperature i did no i want a thermometer in the kid's asshole and i want to hear a beep and  you want to you want an app on your phone i will you constantly check the temperature i have the 
[03:09:00]  app on my phone that i can watch them i can talk to them you know and she'll shut it off because like  i'll be there oh and i'll i'm on the road and i'll hit the button his pacifier fell out and she's like  what she's scared she's what the fuck because all of a sudden that's gonna be weird and she just  shuts she just shuts it down and she won't answer the phone but yeah that's hilarious dude i'm just  starting to come out of that fog and now this yeah seven eight months is about right yeah it's 
[03:09:30]  such a about right you start to be you again and joke again and right starting to happen you start  to see clearer wait till you see your kid like just in front of i don't know the washing machine with  all the detergent around them and you're wondering how much how much did the kid eat and if it's  poisonous you start looking at labels really fast and calling those fucking phone numbers and like how  the fuck did this happen i'm watching all the time yeah like he's starting to the roll now so  we'll have him in the bed and then he'll roll in like two seconds he's upside down and by your feet 
[03:10:00]  and you're like what the fuck was that like how did you do like any seconds away of rolling off the  bed sleeps in the bed with you well stop that immediately all right here's the deal because  my kid's up to four and we're still having a tough time getting him in his own room because we did  exactly that and now with the daughter she never slept with us and she's all good with her own  room already well we had him in his own room in his own crib um but then uh some shit happened and we 
[03:10:30]  brought him in the bed again and he just slept through the night and it's a very lazy thing talk  about the shit that happened i don't know what what happened oh he got sick oh so we felt bad he was all  fucked up and can i tell you one that happened to us yeah you think she's safe in her crib and we're  thinking nothing of it we go in there one night and she's in the pillowcase what she's inside of it  yeah she's inside the pillowcase how old like i don't know a few months ago really they don't tell you 
[03:11:00]  that that a pillowcase could be a problem yeah they make special pillowcases for that very reason i didn't  know how about this we had he got his foot through the fucking crib hole the the slats right and it  got stuck but now he's twisted so he's going to fucking twist like a like a like the death roll of  an alligator he's going to twist his own leg off so we had to go buy like a bumper a mesh bumper for  inside of the crib well you're a rookie you should have had the bumper all along that one you should 
[03:11:30]  have known but they don't why don't they just get the bumper with the crib gotta go bumper you gotta go  you can't go right you have to go mesh bumper because the other bumper killed kids because they  roll up and mush their nose and mouth on it and then you wake up and they're blue you're a little  stone baby so it's uh but you're working into your act yeah i'm with someone see i gotta i gotta slow  this conversation down for a second when you hear a comic is going to do kid material yeah i'm with all 
[03:12:00]  the guys probably out there moaning like oh god who wants to hear this shit but someone like bobby  there's only a few comics that can pull it off in a way that makes it hilariously funny and a bit  edgy right yeah you know yeah it's all fucking edgy good it's all awful it's all awful but it's not  it's not awful in a way you know it's just real like you know i mean it was pretty crazy to  fuck for realsies you know what i mean to fuck a woman for the reason distinct biblically or 
[03:12:30]  scientifically well i don't give a fuck what you believe but like i fucked to make a life which is  what your dick is for i mean that's it you have a dick and jizz comes out of it to make a scientific  jargon is it's to make a life that that's why every animal shoots jizz into a vag right and somehow  we made it into this fun thing well if it well because it felt so god it has to feel good or 
[03:13:00]  people wouldn't do it and it does and then you don't perpetuate the the species so it's a delicate  balance yeah but we but jizz to me was the enemy i mean jizz to you is the enemy the enemy dude your  jizz could your life you don't want uh right like throw your jizz around no since we realized how  you know good it felt we said fuck eternal life yeah and fuck the bible this is good yeah  you know what i mean yeah but they don't teach that wasn't nice of god to make it feel so goddamn good 
[03:13:30]  but it feel and literally it's like what is it a fucking a six second feeling for us right six seconds  and and all the hard work that goes into just jizzing in a box but i've in a box i never to be able to  come inside of a woman and look in her face while you're coming and not see fear or anger  and like what the fuck are you doing wow is an amazing feeling to just leave jizz where it's supposed 
[03:14:00]  to go inside the morning after right it's a fun why have you do you jizz in chicks huh you jizz no you  jizz in a condom right or you pull out it's a big as a myriad of things that could happen to based on  alcohol consumption and where you are and who it is and wake up here it is your dick is snailing out of a  pussy that's great i mean what is your preferred look look i come in my wife everyone loves the 
[03:14:30]  ability to just shoot a fucking load inside someone but sometimes circumstances dictate you  must not you must rip that fucker out right but i've gone out with girls that have been on the pill 
[03:15:00]  things like that i never did that i never trusted i would never come inside i would i would bring it to  the last oh the fucking last second of it's like literally just i could feel it traveling up my vein  you can see the fucking rumblings going up like the troops coming up the vein right into the tip of  the helmet and just a splash of jizz hits her fucking the back of her twat and then rip it out 
[03:15:30]  just throw it on her face like mardi gras beads i was so goddamn good looking that i knew that i knew  i had to take it take it with me yeah oh no like fucking eroc well eroc yeah i would take the nagel  seat home with eroc would come in a condom and then he literally tie it up and put it in his  pocket because he was afraid the girl's gonna squeeze it out into her pussy first of all like  space food i i would i would make sure it was disposed of but eroc would take it with him he would  take it with it he would take it with him true story he would take it with him tie up that condom and 
[03:16:00]  put it in his back pocket would you sooner leave gold to bloom in the garbage of course you take that  precious i don't understand though i mean i'm pretty sure when jizz comes out it dies right i don't  know there's been some stories over the years there have been stories i think i think you got a time  limit you got some time so you can jizz into a condom if i'm aware right and i i get the guys we'll  probably get a chance in a minute you shove it in there just there's a chance there's a chance there's 
[03:16:30]  there's stories over the years so you'd have to put the condom in your pussy and then fix it like a mitten  like yeah yeah and pull it back out reverse it yeah and then you could do that or you could take  like a turkey baster and suck some up and then shove it up there i don't know how much time we'd have  to ask no sperm will live for 24 hours i thought the sperm will ship let's have sex ed i always thought  it died when it hit the air i thought no killed it like aids no no sperm can live for like 24 hours but 
[03:17:00]  of course in a dark moist spot it'll last longer right but uh what about on the what about on the  belly yeah well if she took it and swiped her finger and then shoved her finger inside herself  yeah something could happen what if she did this what if she if you come if she said come on my  stomach and it filled her belly button and then she didn't like she went into the kitchen and got one  of those little travel spoons you get at the airport right like from japan the little one that used 
[03:17:30]  to say the world's fair on the back and dug it out right and then spoon fed her pussy like a cup  of tea i think uh that you could you could be in some danger right there really you could be in some  danger fall let's find out those things get swimming they they got a mission they're on a mission those  little i mean look the odds of getting a girl pregnant regular are fucking astronomical i'm not saying  it's probably the best uh way to do it but dr steve what's up dr steve we're we're trying to learn 
[03:18:00]  about sperm now that we're middle-aged men how long does it stay uh like alive after it leaves your  penis let's say let's do it dries out really even if it's on a belly huh it's on a belly let's say that  that yeah i mean you know well exposed to air if it's spread out like the proverbial map of hawaii  and then it will dry up pretty quickly right but if it's a puddle it's right as long as there is 
[03:18:30]  uh liquid uh uh still existing the sperm can live for quite a while they you know when you go to a sperm  bank you jizz into a cup and they look you know that thing can sit there in the lab for uh an hour  or two before they look at it and then they look at under the microscope and uh you know uh look for  motile sperm and stuff and so yeah they can last for a while i don't know the exact numbers and someone 
[03:19:00]  who works at a sperm bank might know but uh you know and and what they'll do in the in the lab is  they'll add a little saline to it to keep it nice and liquidy and those little fuckers that's saline  could do a lot of shit i love that's saline uh have you ever heard stories of like women uh grabbing  a condom from a wastebasket after the guy leaves or whatever and just like anthony said you just put  it in a turkey baster and just squirt it in there and hope for the best all right oh here's the scenario 
[03:19:30]  you have sex with a woman you leave in the morning now it's like late morning she could actually go  go in that wastebasket and there's still a possibility oh no i don't know about late  morning if it was the night before but if you do like e-rock where you jizz and then get the  fuck out of there right away then yeah then it could happen yeah because she goes how about a couple  hours later you you know you you busted your nuts and you're out cold within five minutes leave  them no you're out cold five minutes later now she's wide away because the women i guess that makes 
[03:20:00]  them hyper she could get up and get some things done huh yeah the longer that the longer the interval  between the time that you ejaculated and she does that the less likely it is there what what if i got  but i don't know that i don't know that the exact interval i find out dr steve what what what what if  i what if you made me stutter what if i got a pencil and mushed them all up and like could you like  frothed them like a cappuccino no there's yeah uh but they're listen they're microscopic so it would 
[03:20:30]  be very difficult just imagine okay you go to an ant hill and you start stomping on them you can  never kill all the fun how about if i put it in my nutribullet yeah what if you made a nice delicious  shake right wait we got whole that's why i i take uh after i jizz i take bleach and splash it on the  girl like the front stoop on i am a legend make sure wait we got it's all dead we got army guys 
[03:21:00]  calling in that's why your pool is so hot you dunk them in a jacuzzi and dunk them in the pool to kill  all the jizz on their body we got army guys calling in dr steve stay in the line we got matt in texas  what's up matt hey what's going on guys all the time fan thank you uh well when i was stationed in  ford still uh every weekend before we went out the uh sergeant for the ncos would tell us  to police up your condoms after you shoot them to put that shit in your pocket because there was a 
[03:21:30]  big deal with the uh females in this area they would take the condom out of the waste bag if you left  right away or if you passed out and they would turn that shit inside out and they were getting  pregnant off the army guys who swore they were using condoms and these girls were getting pregnant  and uh so you guys were warned that the local girls were going to pull these uh shenanigans with  the condoms wow or it happens everywhere but that was like the worst place where it was  our condoms full of jizzle out in the barracks private pile that's holding the jizz what the hell is this 
[03:22:00]  wow thanks for your call kurt in california one more from the army go ahead kurt  kurt yes hello hey buddy hey uh back in the 90s i was told by my uh platoon sergeant that yeah take  the little bottle of tabasco with you and drop that in the condom afterwards that way it will 
[03:22:30]  and then eat it like an oyster uh he made a mistake and put put it on the condom before he put it on  it's just punitive all right thank you so uh putting the tabasco in there is not going to help  it'll just be well make her a real oh shit i like force you to take a morning after pill like giving  a dog a pill you just peanut butter put it in the back of her throat smash your face down a rubber rubber
