<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts and crew engaging in their typical vulgar and self-deprecating banter, launching into a discussion of the "most obnoxious 30 seconds" listener contest.  The contest entries, featuring overwhelmingly loud and high-pitched sounds, were described in detail, with Opie and Anthony lamenting the resulting ringing in their ears. They discussed revising the contest rules to restrict entries to human voices and everyday sounds, excluding computer-generated noises. Callers shared their own reactions to the entries, ranging from startled responses to near-misses while driving.  The "Whip Him Out Wednesday" segment, encouraging women to flash while driving, was also briefly promoted.  The hosts also touched upon Jimmy Flynn's *Last Comic Standing* appearance, Opie's encounter with a fan who was a cab driver, and Opie's alleged penchant for dancing in bars, a recurring joke throughout the show.

The show then shifted to a discussion of Jim Norton's role as roast master on *Last Comic Standing*.  Norton's performance style, described as intentionally uncomfortable and initially poorly received, was analyzed.  The hosts also discussed other comedians, including Pat Cooper (and his past confrontations with other celebrities on their satellite show) and Gabriel Iglesias, a *Last Comic Standing* contestant. Callers shared their opinions on Norton's performance and the show's overall tone; one caller even recounted a glowing-in-the-dark incident in a strip club.

A substantial portion covered the Manhattan townhouse explosion, believed to be a suicide bombing by the homeowner, Dr. Nicholas Bartha, amidst a contentious divorce.  The hosts discussed news coverage, speculation, and the ex-wife's reactions, criticizing the *New York Post*'s prioritization of the townhouse explosion over the Indian train bombings.  They also promoted an upcoming karaoke event at FH Riley's and briefly mentioned the increased fines for radio broadcasters.

The show continued with a satirical discussion of a Columbus Dispatch article about radio stations toning down their stunts due to increased FCC fines.  They mocked tamer promotions, reminisced about past outrageous contests (like "Toys for Ta-Tas," tan line contests, and offering breast jobs), and heavily criticized other radio personalities and shows (Mancow, Wags and Elliot, The Breakfast Club, The Grego Show/The Grego and Mo Show, and Woody and the Wake Up Call), using homophobic and racist slurs in several instances. They recalled their own past stunts, including one at St. Patrick's Cathedral, and brainstormed new, outrageous contest ideas, including one involving listener defecation on numbered squares.  A listener shared experiences with similar radio contests, and a call from Danny DeVito was mentioned.

A significant segment focused on Man Cow's firing from his Chicago station. The hosts and callers debated Man Cow's claims of continued success, speculated on the reasons for his dismissal (ranging from his persona shift to his incorporation of religious and political commentary), and discussed a contest idea centered around No Filter Paul’s bodily excretions.  Man Cow himself called in, engaging in a heated exchange with Opie and Anthony, and a former employee, Patty's Hyman, revealed Man Cow's use of pre-fabricated skits and actors. The show also covered an NBA player, Eddie Griffin, involved in a car accident while allegedly masturbating and watching pornography.  Audio clips and caller anecdotes were included.

The final segment began with a discussion about a forgotten *Taxi* character, followed by listener calls, including a prank call about masturbation at work, triggering numerous graphic anecdotes about masturbation from both hosts and callers. The planned appearance of Danny DeVito, a recurring gag, was mentioned repeatedly.  The upcoming karaoke night at FH Riley's was promoted, and speculation surrounding the lack of Suri Cruise sightings dominated a significant portion.  Finally, Danny DeVito called, discussing *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia*, *Taxi*, and sharing humorous anecdotes.  The hosts mentioned "Jimmy Day," Opie and Anthony “Wow” stickers, and a potential (ultimately unexecuted) prank of hanging up on DeVito.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  No!  Shut up!  Opie and Anthony!  We're so excited to be back.  Rabid radio retards.  Wow!  We're dummies!  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news with perverts, stupid, we stink.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony.  Opie.  I love the hitting and the fighting. 
[00:00:30]  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  James.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing.  We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slump, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  You're like Chuck.  No, that's...  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating boobs.  We pay him out to be.  Right.  E-Roc!  Oh, please, go into a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care!  Shut up!  No, what's wrong, Aaron?  My closet's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats. 
[00:01:00]  Just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opie and A.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  It's a familiar tune.  Yo, what a surprise.  Someone told you I'm good at screaming.  It's a little inside for now, but we'll explain down the road. 
[00:01:30]  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  The O and A virus spreading across America!  My God!  What?  My God!  Wait, what?  I can't hear.  It's spreading across America!  I have this ringing in my ears.  Oh, from yesterday?  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, we are really stupid.  Worst contest ever.  It is the...  It's supposed to be the most obnoxious 30 seconds contest. 
[00:02:00]  This started from an iMac contest.  We had some guy that came up with a wonderful 30 seconds of Jimmy doing his...  mic clearing exercises and threw it together like a big flock of sheep, it sounded like  by the end.  And Opie had a grand idea.  Hey, let's have people send in 30 seconds of the most obnoxious sounds they can come up  with. 
[00:02:30]  Well, it's turned into destroy the host's hearing contest.  Because we're stupid.  Anthony and I were walking out of the building yesterday up the sidewalk and we're talking  about it and I go, yeah, and is your ears ringing like mine?  And he's like, yeah.  We're like 12-year-old kids.  We know that we were damaging our ears yesterday, but we didn't care because it was so silly  and funny.  It was hysterical.  We were doing all this on the XM show, by the way.  It was really funny to hear some of the stuff people came up with because it was so loud  and so obnoxious. 
[00:03:00]  Like, they didn't get the gist of the competition, which is to come up with something obnoxious  sounding, not just loud and obnoxious.  Of course, going into, like, a sawmill without any headphones on to keep the sound out of  your ears is going to be obnoxious.  It's also going to kill your hearing.  Yeah.  These asses figured out which range of, what is it called, that you could go into.  What is it?  I don't know.  Octaves.  The what?  Octaves.  Whatever it is. 
[00:03:30]  They figured that out.  They figured out what level is really obnoxious to humans.  Frequencies.  Frequencies and, yeah, all that crap.  Hey, man, the contest sounded like a good idea at the time.  Well, I wake up this morning and I go into the bathroom, click on the radio, go to brush  my teeth, and I'm going, oh, God, I hope that's just the radio.  I hope it's the radio.  I turn the radio off.  No.  I'm just hearing this in my right ear. 
[00:04:00]  It's like, ah, the good old day.  I blew, like, my ears out years ago.  I've had, like, a little bit of tinnitus in there because of being in bands for so many  years.  You just, you know, nature of the beast kind of thing.  But it's pretty much under control.  It just kind of, you know, can't be shoving iPod pods in there and cranking it up to 10.  But this contest, oh, just screwed me.  Well, stupid me.  I thought our listeners would have fun with it.  Yeah.  I was thinking, like, 30 seconds of them just making an obnoxious, you know, sound. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  But it's as a laugh.  Or repeating something to the point where it was really annoying and really obnoxious.  Yeah.  But, no, they took all the fun out of it.  Unfortunately, I think it was funny, though, that one with the...  And then the sound comes on.  Yeah.  Do we have that one?  That it should be used in battle.  This should be coming out of speakers on top of tanks.  It is so obnoxious and loud and damaging. 
[00:05:00]  It should be used to get a dictator out of his palace.  Yeah, you just aim the speakers toward his palace and play this, and he will come running out.  Yeah, screw playing Van Halen and Twisted Sister.  It doesn't work.  You've heard the stories over the years.  No, man.  You get some of these obnoxious, you know, noises and just blast it over and over again.  They'll come running out.  Yeah.  So now we've got to figure out what to do with the contest.  It's not an official contest.  It's a goofy Opian Anthony contest.  It's a goofy game. 
[00:05:30]  Where there's no rules or anything.  No rules.  You get some recognition.  And maybe a prize if we feel like giving you one.  Or we will have you come on the show or something.  But, yeah, I think the spirit of this competition should go to something more than just making computerized or mechanical noises really loud.  Because anyone can do that.  You go into your garage and take a table saw and mic it, you know?  There was one that was good, though.  It did have more of a sound effect, like sound quality, just noises. 
[00:06:00]  We're thinking more it should be made by your own body because that's what Jimmy's was.  That's what yours was.  There was nothing more than the sound you make with your own mouth.  Oh, not that one.  The other one.  That's called auditioning.  The other one.  Well, I mean, this is the one you were talking about earlier.  Uh-oh.  This side of the Opie and Anthony show has not heard this.  I'm taking my headphones off.  We are really stupid radio hosts.  People are just waking up.  If you're listening with headphones on, please be careful. 
[00:06:30]  Can you imagine that someone's, like, radio alarm clock is listening to us right now?  Set to go off right about now.  Listening to ours.  Soothing voices.  And this comes.  Good morning to you.  It's going to rain here in New York today.  Traffic is bad just like it is every day.  We ought to play this.  Ah, the All-Star game was played last night.  And Dr. Doom is an ass.  We ought to play this at, like, 6.30, 7 o'clock. 
[00:07:00]  Like, when people have their alarms set for.  Right.  A lot of people have their alarms set for 6.  Yeah.  You know, we're just kind of being played in the background right now.  Yeah.  As they roll over a few times.  And then you get this.  And, yeah, this is one of the entries in the most annoying or most obnoxious 30 seconds ever.  This is the one Anthony was talking about.  He just nailed me yesterday.  Yeah. 
[00:07:30]  I'm a faggot.  All right.  Look, I'll agree.  It's hysterically funny.  And I don't know why.  I don't know why that I laugh at that.  Because it's so annoying. 
[00:08:00]  And then that sound that comes in is so incredibly bad for your hearing.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  We are so dumb.  We're turning people off.  We're idiots.  All right.  Do you want to hear the other two that really got us?  And then we might have to change the contest starting today.  Yeah.  Because I still think there's something to this thing.  Yeah, you should be able to vocalize it and then have to, you know, alter it with your computer or whatever the hell you're using to make it different and make it obnoxious. 
[00:08:30]  Right.  Well.  Like Jimmy's.  My poetry comes from within.  Of course it does.  All right.  Well, this one really got to us yesterday, too.  This might be really bad.  I'm warning you right now.  I'm not sure anymore.  Take my headphones off again.  Yeah, so am I.  This is from Sniper.  Is this the most obnoxious 30 seconds ever?  Oh, God.  Hold on.  God bless the climbing world to me. 
[00:09:00]  All right, listen.  That was one.  That was okay.  We would like that as part of the contest. 
[00:09:30]  That wasn't that bad.  You see my list in front of me?  I crossed out the ones that will damage your hearing.  Yeah, that'll kill your ears.  These are the two I checked off saying we could play these in the normal contest.  Yeah.  That one is obnoxious.  And that's coming from your mouth there.  Your mouth.  There's some sound effects in there.  And then there's that phone thing that happens when you leave it off the hook.  Yeah, that stuff is okay.  It's just when you start getting into those noises, those frequencies. 
[00:10:00]  Out of nowhere.  You know, so, and this is another one I think is okay.  This one might not damage your hearing either.  This is from Tom.  The most obnoxious 30 seconds ever.  You know, so, and this is another one I think is okay.  You know, so, and this is another one I think is okay.  You know, so, and this is another one I think is okay.  You know, so, and this is another one I think is okay.  You know, so, and this is another one I think is okay.  You know, so, and this is another one I think is okay.  You know, so, and this is another one I think is okay.  You know, so, and this is another one I think is okay.  You know, so, and this is another one I think is okay.  You know, so, and this is okay.  You know, so, and this is okay.  You know, so, and this is okay.  You know, so, and this is okay.  You know, so, and this is okay.  you can tell when they're really obnoxious when when you're saying

[00:17:00]  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  See, there you go.  That's like an... 
[00:17:30]  I remember one being worse than this.  Am I wrong?  I thought there was one that was worse than this.  All right, go back to the lab, Dan.  See how this is?  Go back to the lab.  They're so bad and disturbing and damaging that you actually forget which ones are which.  You get like this whole disorientation thing going.  It's very addicting.  These horrible sounds?  But that last one was done by some kind of audio engineer that just understands frequencies.  Yeah, that beep-beep thing was really screwing up my ears.  And what will, you know, bother a human ear. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  The phones are just lit.  People are hating us.  They are very angry.  A lot of people say that one was the worst.  Oh, okay.  Jason in Colorado.  Yeah, that's the one.  I was driving my truck yesterday with my headphones on.  I listened to it.  Blew my eardrums down.  Like an idiot, I'm listening to the replay.  I end up smacking myself in the back of the head to get the earphones off my head.  There you go.  This thing sucks.  All right, bro.  Yes.  Fudging out.  Wow, man.  The competition is horrible. 
[00:18:30]  We never get this many phone calls this early because people are still kind of waking up.  Oh, they're awake now.  And getting themselves together.  So we got to adjust the contest because the audio engineers are getting involved and they  know exactly what to throw on tape to really kill our ears.  Yeah.  It's got to be something you can make with your own voice.  Your own voice or clips from the show.  Or clips.  Or clips in general as long as it's human clips.  It could be movie clip.  And you could.  Anything.  I guess you could use sounds that we all know in our everyday life.  That's fine, too.  Not just these computer generated awfulness. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, we don't want the computer generated stuff.  We don't want the, you know, the frequency crap.  UFO sounds.  UFO sounds.  It's stuff like we hear in our everyday lives.  That's fine, too.  That's fine, too.  Yeah.  All right.  Last one sounded like hearing tests.  Yeah, that was like a hearing test for like.  They still do that?  That one is.  Or have they come up with a new way to give a hearing test to the kids?  That was probably a hearing test for someone that has like 1% of their hearing left and  they just want to make sure the ears have something left in them. 
[00:19:30]  Trying to get some kind of reaction out of the ears.  Remember the big headphones you had to put on?  And then you'd hear boop.  You have to raise your hand for which one you heard it in.  Beep.  Yeah.  And you know what?  I got to take people inside the show a little bit.  Oh.  On regular radio.  You're breaking down a wall or you're taking them in?  Yeah, I'm going to break down a wall here.  Which one?  I don't know.  We'll give it the fourth wall.  The fourth?  Wait a minute now.  You've never done that.  I know. 
[00:20:00]  I've used every other number.  It's the 18th wall.  According to my OCD, I haven't used the number four yet.  Right.  This is so much worse on satellite radio.  Yeah.  We're being heard on commercial radio and XM satellite radio at the same time.  Because of how satellite radio is set up, they don't have processing.  Yeah.  So the sounds that come through are a little crisper in general.  Yep.  You know, there's something with commercial radio where they kind of soften everything.  Yeah.  They'll take a look at what we would just play. 
[00:20:30]  Like the machines, the gizmos and gadgets that work.  They'll take a look at what we just played and flatten it out for you.  Yeah.  They'll soften.  So it's not coming out.  It's not so many peaks and valleys coming out of your speakers.  But yeah, on satellite, forget it.  You're just getting the pure.  Oh, yeah.  Every spike is going right through your eardrum.  So for the people that are listening to us on commercial radio, trust me, it's even worse for the satellite radio listener.  There's a selling point for XM.  Well, it should be.  If you didn't think you needed satellite radio, well, what you're hearing blown, get it. 
[00:21:00]  We can damage your ears.  People had no idea what we were doing.  Because like I said, half of them were just kind of waking up.  Listen to some of these stories.  Sean in Philly, what's up?  Hey, yo, guys.  Hey, good to have you back.  I used to listen to you back in the NEW days down in D.C.  I'm in Philly, man.  Staying in a hotel.  Literally fell out of bed.  I heard you guys come on.  Then I hit the snooze bar.  It comes back on.  And you a-holes are doing that. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, that would be really disturbing if you hit the snooze and then the alarm comes on five minutes later and it's that.  That's all you hear.  Frunkus.  Frunkus.  Let's say hi to John in New York.  John, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Good morning.  Good morning, John.  Good morning, guys.  Back in Brooklyn.  Yeah, we're-  Good to be back.  You guys found out the Cure of a road rage.  Yeah?  Yeah, you got the Cure of a road rage and you also just made my dog jump out the window.  Yeah, what that does to dogs, too, we've heard, is awful. 
[00:22:00]  They just, they howl and hide.  Yeah.  Dogs don't like sounds like that.  It's not at all.  The only way to help your dog right now if he's running around is to just pick him up and apply a little pink lipstick to your face.  It'll help him.  Hang it out with the dog at JFK.  Calm him down.  All right.  Thanks, bro.  Be good.  See ya.  Just calm a dog down.  So we're changing the contest.  Changing the contest.  It's got to be 30 seconds from your mouth, sound clips, and everyday noises that we at least are used to. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  Like Anthony said, none of this UFO crap.  Well, Lee from Arkansas is the one that sent in probably the worst one ever with the, I'm a faggot.  Lee, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, Lee.  That was yours, the one with the UFO sounds, and then after I'm a faggot, the loud thing.  What is that?  Well, it's actually a lot of things.  It's about 15 things layered together. 
[00:23:00]  But it's like the high-pitched screech is actually a guitar that's looped over and over and over.  Really?  Yeah.  Because that is really bad.  How did you do that without killing yourself when you were done?  Oh, man.  There's a worse one that I sent in that will give you a headache.  But, you know, I just wanted to put Jimmy in the middle of it, right?  So it would draw people's attention and then just hit them with a screech afterwards.  Yeah, that was a great strategy because the first part of that is bad enough. 
[00:23:30]  But then after the Jimmy clip, it just takes on a whole new life of ear-damaging fun.  That's the best one, I think.  Yeah, so far.  That's fantastic.  So far, so good.  Yeah.  But because of you and others, Lee, we're changing the contest a little bit.  Yeah, Lee, send that to the military.  Yeah, there you go.  Hey, one more thing.  There was a guy from Florida that called yesterday saying I ripped it off of a sci-fi movie,  and I just wanted to make sure the listeners know that I didn't rip it off of a sci-fi movie.  I know what he was talking about, the one with Anthony, where the TV is kind of jumping around the room. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  That wasn't it.  We knew, Lee.  All right, Lee.  We have faith in you, Lee.  Godspeed.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  Hey, before I take a break, I've got to say hi to Jimmy Flynn.  That's right, Jimmy Flynn.  What the hell is that?  I said I'd say hi to Jimmy Flynn on the radio, and I'm saying hi to Jimmy Flynn.  You'd do that?  I'd just say yes.  Absolutely.  I'll give you a shout-out.  Yeah, it's your birthday.  You'll hear it tomorrow. 
[00:24:30]  Listen to the show.  I can't be bothered.  The first American cabbie that I've seen in years picked me up yesterday.  His name is Jimmy Flynn.  Was he insane?  He was completely normal.  Wow, that never happened.  He does this as a second job, completely normal, and a huge fan of the show.  I'm like, oh, thanks.  So you got X7?  He goes, no, since you guys have been back on regular radio here in New York City.  Jimmy Flynn.  See?  See, Jimmy?  I don't forget. 
[00:25:00]  Wait, now I have to do it to the four hunky firemen that stopped outside the comedy cell last night on the truck,  and we all chit-chat.  That's right.  They were hunky.  Four beefy firemen.  Ew.  The mention of the show, so hello to the four beefcakes.  Obi, the mention for Jimmy Flynn wasn't in lieu of a tip, was it?  It's funny you say that.  No, it's not.  And Jimmy's smiling right now because I...  You didn't have anything? 
[00:25:30]  No, no.  I get in the cab with Lindsey.  The guy looks through the rear view, and I'm like, uh-oh, is he insane?  Why is he looking at me like that?  And he goes, hey, Opie from O&A.  And then he was just huge fan, so we talked all the way down to Soho.  And then I'm whispering to Lindsey, I'm like, you know what this means?  I'm like, I can't give him the regular tip.  Nope.  I gotta give him a little extra.  I gotta give him a little extra here.  Someone's a fan, you gotta really cough up. 
[00:26:00]  I was really pumped.  Wow.  Because I had just enough money to get down there.  I didn't feel like hitting an ATM machine.  So you're talking, you gave him, like, paper money.  I had to bump him up a bit.  Not that jingly kind.  When someone recognizes you, you can't then give him the regular, you know, oh, it's a  $750, you know, ride.  Ah, keep the $50.  Here's eight.  Here's eight.  Nah, I'm better than that.  You keep it.  You tell Ty Webb I'm good at it.  If he's half as good as he says he is, he's going to have to play me to prove it. 
[00:26:30]  I'm stupid.  Okay, boogie.  Nah, I'm a little better than that, but I had to give him a 10 spot.  Yeah.  As a tip.  You have to.  You gotta.  So Jimmy Flann, hope you're having a good morning, man.  He was very cool.  Good for him.  He loved the Mantown stuff.  Who doesn't?  And then I was thinking, why haven't we done Mantown stuff in a while?  Because we pretty much beat him.  I know, but it's still a lot of fun, that Mantown stuff.  Yeah, but you don't want to incur the anger of that show either.  We don't need to deal with that.  The Wrath of Mantown? 
[00:27:00]  Man, I don't know what to say.  What'll that bring?  Ouch.  All right.  Won't sit for a week.  We got lots to do today.  Jimmy was on Last Comic Standing last night on NBC.  I missed it.  We got the audio, Anthony.  It's really good.  It's quick.  We'll do that next.  We got a nice plug for the radio show.  Man, cow's out in Chicago, and no one really cares.  Out with a fizzle.  They thought he was going to be on Friday.  I guess the whole show did.  And then, oops, they pull the plug on you and say, nope. 
[00:27:30]  Goodbye.  And then, of course, we got to read the front pages of all the New York papers.  Dr. Doom is still very hot in the news here in New York City.  Dr. Doom.  We'll get into that as well.  And, of course, it's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Yes, it is.  It's the One virus spreading across America.  So I was in the grocery store, and there was this stock boy stacking melons.  So I figured, hey, I'll show him some real melons.  Well, when I flashed him, he lost his balance, and the entire stack of melons came crashing down on him. 
[00:28:00]  He was suffocated under two tons of melons.  But my melons are still juicy and perky.  Please, wow responsibly.  A public service announcement of the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hear what everybody else is talking about.  O&A, uncut and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio, starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:28:30]  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  He's dancing.  Yes, I am.  I'm good.  Dance, dance, dance.  Let me dance, too.  Oh.  He's dancing.  I don't think I'm going to dance.  O.P. dances like the father in fame when he parks the cab with two arms going up.  Oh.  That's my son playing Bruno Martelli.  Easy.  O.P. has actually danced in public. 
[00:29:00]  What are you talking about?  You've danced at like clubs.  What are you talking about?  When you go out, you have a little too many maybe.  I don't dance in clubs.  Do you hear what you're saying?  Even as a joke.  I don't even go to clubs.  But you've done it.  Not a dance club.  A bar, let's say.  A song will come on and you'll start doing your little dance.  O.P.'s a raver.  Well, that's a lot different than going, I go to clubs and dance, you ass.  Is it a club?  Now the Photoshop's are going to start going nuts.  They're going to have me as freaking John Chapulte. 
[00:29:30]  Tony Manero.  Go to OpieandAnthony.com to get to all our fan sites, by the way.  You didn't call me, Opie.  No, I'll do a little bounce thing from the side at a regular bar, you ass.  That's what I'm talking about.  You're dancing at a club.  You said I go to clubs and dance.  It's a club, but you're dancing a little.  That's all I'm saying.  That's what you do.  You do that little back thing.  The little backwards thing.  You actually do move.  No.  I raise my hands in the air like I just don't care.  You do, like, a move, though. 
[00:30:00]  It's not different every time.  So you have a dance, and it's at a club.  I do a little bounce.  A little bounce.  It's a little bounce, but it's not at a club.  No, there's hands are involved.  If you just did a bounce, that's one thing.  But hands are involved.  Kenny's seen it.  Kenny, no.  Kenny, can you do it?  Are you crazy?  You guys are crazy.  I am not crazy.  Watch Jimmy.  Jimmy's got a dance.  Jimmy's got it.  There it is.  I don't do that.  That's the dance.  That's what we call the Opie dance.  I don't do that, you hooker-loving ass.  It's almost a Davy Jones skate with something else thrown in I can't quite figure out. 
[00:30:30]  Ben.  Ben.  With a little bit of Ben Sparks twitch.  You guys have lost your mind.  Do the Ben.  I do a little bounce.  Do the Ben.  I do a little bounce because I'm feeling the rhythm.  Next thing you know, I'm dancing in clubs.  Are you insane?  I meant out in public.  You know what that entails?  I meant out in public at a bar.  When a song comes on the jukebox, you'll do that move.  For 10 seconds. 
[00:31:00]  It's long enough.  Maybe.  What I was getting to was the point that I don't dance.  Not at weddings.  Not at anything.  And the fact that, you know, you should be proud that you're that open.  I don't dance.  You do.  How come everyone can do it then?  I don't know.  Ben.  Ben's doing it.  You guys had a secret meeting before I got here.  It's obvious.  No, he didn't.  Time to throw Opie under the bus.  No.  Again.  You dance.  It's all right.  I don't know what I can do.  Secret meetings going on. 
[00:31:30]  I'm convinced of it.  Secret room.  No, it came up.  Secret room with secret meetings before I get here.  It was the natural course of conversation.  If you listen to the replay, you'll see how it got there.  I don't know how.  I'm going to get here.  Why would I be dancing at clubs?  My pockets are full of money.  I don't want to risk the money falling out.  Now you've angered our producer.  And then I have to awkwardly pick it up in front of everybody.  It's funny.  You talked about Ben.  I can't say what it is.  Let's just say we did voiceover things for something yesterday. 
[00:32:00]  I can't really say what it is.  You'll eventually know.  Yeah.  But they said, you know, I did some, Opie did some, Ann's going to do some, and Ben did  some.  And Laszlo was telling me that it was really funny because Ben was...  That's good.  Doesn't matter?  No, it doesn't matter.  But Ben was on a mic, and he said the guy had to go, dude, you got to stop shaking off  the mic.  Because Ben kept doing his lines like all over the place.  Oh, he wasn't maintaining like three inches from the mic.  He's like three feet away, right against it, two feet away. 
[00:32:30]  Some sound engineer's got to screw with that.  Sounds like an atomic weapon going off in the Grand Canyon.  Anyway, it's Whip'em Out Wednesday.  Yes, it is.  Make sure you get the wows on your cars, especially to the new listeners.  This thing, tell them, Anthony.  Well, before I explain, I want to pop up all the ladies on Pal Talk, because when you start  talking about Whip'em Out Wednesday, they whip them out on Pal Talk for us.  Yeah, we got so many things going on with this show.  Oh, there's video. 
[00:33:00]  We got the Pal Talk.  People are checking out video of us right now in studio doing this radio show.  Yeah, we got hundreds of people in these rooms, and they can check out video of us in the  studio just hanging out.  And on Wednesdays.  You can hear some of the stuff we're talking about during breaks.  Yeah, and on Wednesdays, they love to flash us.  Whip'em Out Wednesday, every Wednesday.  You put a wow on your vehicle.  Any way, shape, or form, you can get the officially sanctioned wow bumper sticker, which, how do  you get that?  You got to send a self-addressed stamped envelope.  Hold on.  I'm not even listening to you right now.  What happened?  What?  This dancing thing is taking off because you ass wipes. 
[00:33:30]  Okay.  Okay.  I'll explain.  You don't have to.  It's cool.  The club.  Let them think what they want.  You were going down to the disco.  Cigars and Scotch.  Cigars and Scotch.  Ellen's got nothing on O.P.  Oh, no.  What did I do to you, Cigars and Scotch?  Does that make him dancing on in the beginning of the show?  I've done nothing but support you, my friend.  And you throw him under a bus.  Billy and Jersey, what's up?  Didn't I see you doing the electric slide at F.H. Riley? 
[00:34:00]  See you later, Bert.  Can I be here?  Of course, I will take advantage of that.  F.H. Riley's is the fine restaurant I own with my brothers in Huntington, 400 New York  Avenue in Huntington Village.  And no, I do not do the electric slide at that fine establishment.  I'm going to that establishment with the boys on Friday.  On Friday, perhaps after a couple of glasses of wine or something, maybe you get to see O.P.  do his moves.  It's karaoke, right?  Now everyone's going to be looking at me to see if I do a little thing. 
[00:34:30]  I've seen you do it at F.H. Riley's.  I've seen you leaning against the wall.  Do the little back.  It's like the shoulders kind of roll back.  It's kind of like a little relaxed shoulder roll.  Ah.  Yeah, I think this was one of the songs.  It's the only time I feel like someone when I'm dancing, dancing down at the disco. 
[00:35:00]  O.P. gets in the car with a double J.  Annette, cigarette.  What the F.  I've just seen you do the moves, even at F.H. Riley's.  You were leaning against the wall one day.  And a song came on.  And you just like, you put on the face and you got the arms going.  And I'm like, yeah, O.P.'s feeling it.  He's feeling the groove.  I do a little bounce.  But there are arms. 
[00:35:30]  Bounce is like you're making it sound like you're river dancing.  Ben just actually handed me a funny note.  No way.  O.P. goes raving at crowbar with glow sticks.  Well, Bert and Phillies, the O.P. dance is your chance.  Do the O.P.  Do the O.P.  The O.P.  Do the O.P.  O.P.  We've just all seen it.  That's all.  Yeah, yeah, great. 
[00:36:00]  Great, great.  Hey, Max, give me a bitch.  Trust me.  I'm not saying anything that just happens.  We all haven't seen.  It's the move.  O.P. dance.  It's not wrong with this.  We all have our own little things.  Nothing.  Everyone gets a little chuckle out of it.  It's funny.  We know you're not seriously, you know, dancing.  I could be on the next episode of So You Think You Can Dance.  This is inside probably, but we don't feel like explaining everything on this show.  Bert and Philly, this weekend at FH Riley's. 
[00:36:30]  No filter, Paul.  To O.P.  Why don't you call me, O.P.?  Call me.  I hope it ends the same way with him plummeting from a bridge.  That stupid Lego person wig flying off his head.  Big platform shoes.  Walking down the sidewalk crying.  That's what I want to see.  No filter, Paul, dressed in white 70s clothing with platform shoes.  Big platform shoes and gold chains.  White platform shoes.  Perhaps it in Elvis' cape.  Let's say hi to Chris in West Point. 
[00:37:00]  Chris.  Yeah, he was looking like Buffalo Bill dancing.  By the way, Clerks 2 is coming out soon.  I saw the movie.  It's great.  I think we're going to have the gang in next week.  Nice.  This is a nice James Gumm scene.  James Gumm.  Would you?  I was going to say James.  James, of course I did.  James Gumm.  Yeah, yeah, James.  James Gumm.  But there is a fine little dance sequence in the new Clerks 2 movie that made me laugh out loud. 
[00:37:30]  Would you?  Let's go to Dan in Boston.  Dan, what's up?  I got to do the thing.  Touching his own nipple with his stupid, dirty, mechanic fingernails.  She's a great, big, fat person.  Mrs. Littman.  Mrs. Littman.  I think I got a card inside.  You want to go inside?  Jack Gordon.  You need help with that?  Would you?  Thank you. 
[00:38:00]  Greatest character ever.  Oh, what a doll he was.  Dan, hold on one second.  Tony from a lake in New Jersey I cannot pronounce.  Onkonkoma?  No, no, Lake...  Hopatakon.  Lake Apakon.  Lake Apakon.  Apakon.  Lake Apakon.  I don't know.  It starts with an H.  H-O-P-A-T-C-O-N-G.  Apakon.  Apakon.  Lake Apakon.  Oh.  Stinks.  Another Indian name.  Exactly.  Ugh.  The Indians got screwed.  We took their land.  Did they?  And then just named things after them. 
[00:38:30]  It's Lake Ten Bucks.  Now beat it.  Right.  Take these anthrax blankets with you.  Exactly.  Keep you warm.  Lake, here's a bead.  Tell your story walking, fella.  Tony's on to something.  I hope he can't dance because his wallet keeps him off balance.  That's all you're seeing.  That's all you're really seeing there is me just trying to keep everything balanced.  What I should do is start carrying two wallets in my backpack.  Right.  Dan in Boston, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey, man.  I got an old WAF Real Rock TV tape in it. 
[00:39:00]  Opie and Anthony at a WAF event and Opie's dancing in the background to one of the songs.  He looks like a total jackass.  Wow.  Classic.  You don't have that.  Yeah.  You had Billy Idol in the studio doing an orgasm or having some girl do an orgasm for him.  Right.  And then you guys were at the Bayside Expo Center and Opie was doing like a skateboard thing,  but it wasn't really him skateboarding.  Oh, I remember that bit.  That was funny.  It was me. 
[00:39:30]  It was you.  It was Opie right at the lip of a half pipe.  Shut up.  It was me the whole time.  And he'd like jump off and then he switched clothes with this kid who was really good.  And he's like, he's got a hood pulled up over his head and he's doing some like  some rad moves on this half pipe.  And then he comes flying up and of course it cuts back to Opie going, ha, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, but when it cuts back to me, I'm supposed to be at the bottom of the half pipe.  Yeah.  You know, and I fell on my ass and pretty much messed up my back pretty bad. 
[00:40:00]  I couldn't even do that part of the bit.  There was no real skateboarding in that without dying.  I want a copy of that video.  What gave it away is your shoes changed.  Oh, there's a whole series.  My shoes changed?  Yeah, when it panned to the guy going down the half pipe, it was a different color shoe.  Continuity error.  Yeah.  Son of a...  All right, boys.  You rock.  All right, Dan.  Send that tape in if you have it.  We'll throw it up on the website.  What the hell?  I'd love to see some of that old Real Rock TV stuff. 
[00:40:30]  I got all of them.  I got all of them.  Do you?  I got every episode.  Are you kidding?  I save everything.  Okay, one day you're going to have to let me borrow them so I can put them on a DVD.  Invite me to your house and I'll bring them over.  You're cordially invited.  This Sunday.  Sunday?  I got plans.  Saturday?  I got plans.  Tony, you don't call me.  I'll call you.  They're on VHS.  I got to switch them over before they run out. 
[00:41:00]  They rot.  They're going to run out of VHS machines soon.  I got dats.  I got this.  I got dats.  Oh.  Anyway, it's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Let's explain that.  Now we have to take a break.  Then we'll do the last comic standing and we'll talk about Dr.  Now they're calling him Dr. Boom.  Dr. Boom and Dr. Doom.  I like Dr. Doom, but now it's even better with Dr. Boom.  Dr. Boom is funnier.  I prefer Darth Vader without the mask.  That's exactly who he looks like with his big fat face.  Oh, Jesus.  When they're pulling him out on the stretcher, his face does look like when they took Darth's 
[00:41:30]  mask.  And what happens to women?  Was she ever a woman?  Is that what that is?  The front page of the post.  That's what he was divorcing.  What happens?  If you're lucky enough to be married to the same person for a long time, your woman starts  turning into a man.  She looks like Harry Dean Stanton.  The hair gets shorter.  The voice gets a little deeper.  The hair starts growing a little bit in places that it shouldn't be growing. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they cut all their hair off.  Get that move.  All right.  We'll get into all that next.  But whip him out Wednesday.  Let's give it the big plug here.  Right.  Get a wow on the vehicle.  The XM Nation, they got their wow stickers.  They know how to get their wow stickers at this point, hopefully.  Truckers at the next stop, all you got to do is scrape it in the dirt on the back of your  rig.  And then one of these days you'll be driving, girl that's familiar with the program is going  to see the wow, know what it means, pull up next to you, and flash you.  Makes that commute so much better. 
[00:42:30]  Makes the traffic jams better.  You're sitting in traffic, maybe.  You look over.  There's a girl next to you.  Boom.  There you go.  You're seeing some lovelies.  It's been working for many, many years.  Yep.  And if you don't believe us, women who are wowing today, give us a call.  Give us a call.  So we can prove to the rest of America this is going on.  As you do it.  Right.  And so the XM Nation, they know how to get their wow stickers.  The commercial radio stations were on.  Hopefully they got something going on on the website on how you could get your Opie and 
[00:43:00]  Anthony wow stickers.  Hopefully they're doing that.  If not, just make your wow sticker at home.  Homemade wow stickers work just as well.  Okay?  Right.  And, of course, wow stands for whip them out Wednesday.  We pretty much say at this point, whip them out whenever.  Thank God whenever also starts.  It works with a W.  It works great when you're stuck in traffic going to a sporting event.  It's going to be whip them out anytime, but that's why.  Not as catchy.  Or going to a concert or the park or the beach.  Mm-hmm.  That's when it really works. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  Or maybe when you're stuck in traffic going to work.  You never know.  Whipped them out.  Please offend the Italians.  Well, stupid man cow, when he stole our wow bit, he called it whip it out Wednesday.  Yeah.  Couldn't even steal it right.  Yeah.  Whip it out Wednesday.  Whip it out Wednesday.  Everybody's going to be whipping it out on the roads today.  Are they?  So, there you have it.  Try it for yourself.  All we ask, and we've been saying this for years, do not harass the ladies.  Do not follow the ladies.  There are plenty of women out there that have no problem doing this. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  Once it's done, it's done.  You both move on.  Yeah.  You just throw the wow on your car and just kind of forget about it.  And one day, it's going to happen.  You're going to go, oh, my God.  These guys were right.  It works.  If she flashes, it doesn't mean she wants to sleep with you in the shoulder of the road.  It's just a fun thing for the show.  It's just a cute little thing to get you to work.  Yeah.  Without killing somebody.  All right.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Prepare to be wowed.  What?  Knockers.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Okay, okay, fine. 
[00:44:30]  Wow me.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Who do you want to say hi to today?  What?  Who do you want to say hi to?  Why?  What are we doing?  What city?  What city?  What city?  Oh, I'm loving Pittsburgh lately.  Cleveland?  No.  Yeah, I like Cleveland.  Dallas?  No.  Sacramento?  We're not a sacra-  Fair.  Cleveland.  Cleveland. 
[00:45:00]  Hi, Cleveland.  Aren't we going to have some news for Cleveland soon?  That would be nice.  I think we're going to have news for Cleveland soon.  Yes, we're now doing overnights.  We owe them a visit.  We were supposed to visit that fine city and then we got fired four years ago.  Right before we were coming, believe me.  We were planning a Halloween thing.  Yep.  And we got fired in August of that year.  So, what's up, Cleveland?  You might have heard about it.  Why don't we say hi to Ohio in general? 
[00:45:30]  The whole state?  Because we ignore the big wazoo.  We're on the big wazoo in Columbus.  Yes.  Hello, Columbus.  And they had an article about shock jocks the other day.  Can we print that up?  Hey, fuck jocks.  Yeah, print it.  This article pretty much says that we wrecked radio for everybody.  Yeah.  We are the ones that reined it.  Hey, you reined it.  You know, a lot of jocks did edgy radio before we did our Sex for Sam stunt.  And now it's just no. 
[00:46:00]  And according to this article, we pretty much wrecked it for everybody.  We ruined the genre.  Yeah, Google our names.  There's two that came out of Columbus, Ohio, I think, yesterday that are pretty funny.  There were low-rated asses being thrown off the radio left and right back in the day.  Yeah.  But we were among the untouchables, the ones with high ratings, syndicated, that can do anything.  We'd get in trouble, be reprimanded, suspended, perhaps, things like that, but never fired.  So when we got fired, it just sent that shockwave that you just can't do everything. 
[00:46:30]  Now they're having big contests, which is like, whoever's got the prettiest smile wins some cinnamon toast.  Yeah, they've really, really just had to tame it down.  I got to ask Jimmy because it's distracting me.  What glittery whore were you with last night that there is sparkles all over your face?  You're like a big, drooling disco ball.  I actually.  Wait a minute.  I didn't even notice.  Dude, look at him in the light.  He's like a diamond. 
[00:47:00]  Get under one of the spotlights.  Get under there and move your head around.  Move your head, yeah.  You're the disco ball.  I need to dance to him.  Yes, do the moves.  I with one of my gentleman friends.  Uh-oh.  All right, well, that's great.  All right, we don't need it.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Moving on.  Oh.  Oh.  Why doesn't your mic work?  That's weird.  That would really suck that they don't get to hear the rest of that story because it sounds  like a really gay story.  His friend, Mr. Gum.  We went to a, I very rarely will go to strip clubs, but we went to one. 
[00:47:30]  Yes, I assumed from all the sparkles on you because that's the only, that's the only,  only women that wear sparkles anymore are the, uh, the strippers, which is very dangerous  for guys.  I've always said this.  Proven they hate men.  Yeah.  By the way.  I've always said this.  They secretly hate men.  You gotta watch your ass when you go to the strip clubs because you come home and you're  tagged.  You're tagged like a lion with a big tag in his ear and a radio transmitter collar.  You have been to the strip club.  They have tracked you.  And now the wife will know when you come home and you, you glimmer that you've been somewhere 
[00:48:00]  because you can't say that came from anywhere else.  I was with the guys on a hard day at the office.  We were throwing sparkles at each other.  What a day.  You can't say you were volunteering your time at the grammar school and helping little  kids make cute art projects.  No.  Those are much bigger sparkles.  That was the last time you used sparkles.  You used sparkles in kindergarten or you have some interaction with sparkles when you're 
[00:48:30]  in kindergarten and then, uh, fast forward strip clubs.  Yeah.  Nothing in between.  No.  I went to one last night and, um, yeah, it was just for a little hang.  It was nothing major.  I would guess your head kind of, uh, went places.  No, we're in fun lap dance, Jimmy.  Yeah.  But lap dances now, nowadays, uh, no touching, right?  There's a little bit of nothing major.  You never do something for the hang.  So what's the inside story?  None really.  You actually just decided to go to a strip club last night.  With a buddy of mine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That is kind of, you know, sometimes you just go. 
[00:49:00]  He's looking at me like I'm crazy, Anthony.  Have you ever heard Jimmy go, yeah, last night I decided to just hang with a buddy and go  to a strip club?  No.  There's always some other reason.  But I don't, yeah, no, I don't go to strip clubs ever.  I know.  That's why I'm wondering what was, what's the real reason?  Yeah.  It just came up.  Your buddy wanted to go.  You wanted to just go?  Yeah.  All right.  Um, and we just went.  It was like, it was like that.  Strip clubs have gotten to the point where they suck so bad.  I hate them.  You can't sit there.  You, like, you can't move.  You feel intimidated.  You got to sit.  You ever see, uh, the episode of Star Trek, the pilot, uh, the menagerie? 
[00:49:30]  You got to sit like Captain Christopher Pike in that chair where he, you know, and just  beep, beep, beep.  He beeped once for yes and twice for no.  It's a couple of hundred years in the future and they haven't figured that one out.  They just, he had to be, but that's how you got to sit.  You can't move your hands.  You can't do anything.  And you feel ridiculous just sitting still like Christopher Reeve.  You're just sitting there and she, she puts her hair in your lap.  Ooh, spins her head around. 
[00:50:00]  And then maybe she'll, she'll take her upper half and kind of thrust it toward your head.  And I'm guessing that's where your sparkles came from.  But the worst move.  It's all into your eyes.  It really is.  Now it's going to, it's getting funnier as I look at you.  It's all over its face.  Here's the worst.  Did you wash your face?  No.  Dude, it is from the top of your head down to your chin on every part of your face, depending  on how you move in the light.  I see nothing but sparkles now.  Oh.  One just glimmered on your cheek.  You look like a glam rocker. 
[00:50:30]  I'm pretty.  You're pretty.  It's when the strippers will look at you and they turn around and they, and they kind  of like arch their back and they smack their own ass with that awful windmill slap.  Yeah.  The big high, like they're bowling.  Yeah.  They go up for the big high smack.  Whoa.  Sexy.  Ah.  Boy.  I don't know if I can control myself.  Beat it.  Leave.  I want to go.  Strippers.  There's a sponsor of this show, the Hustler Club.  I do want to go to that place.  I always drive by it on like the West Side Highway and I want to go in there. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  Never been there.  See?  We were supposed to do something with the Hustler Club and it fell through.  Only because Larry, I, you know, anything Larry Flint's name is attached to makes me  happy.  Yes.  It's just, we were supposed to do something with the listeners and it fell through last  minute.  Oh my God.  Yeah, you're right.  What was it?  We were celebrating something.  You're right.  I don't remember.  Celebrating that we were able to go a month on the radio without getting in trouble or something.  That's great, Jimmy.  You know, you're at a strip club and I'm being the responsible one and I'm watching  you on Last Comic Standing last night so I can talk about it on the show. 
[00:51:30]  Up a little late.  I taped it.  Well, we got the audio.  I DVR.  First of all, we try to be honest in the show.  I hate Last Comic Standing.  The concept is great, but they're just failing miserably with this freaking show.  Unwatchable.  It seems to be the easiest concept and they're just messing it up.  Yeah.  They picked the wrong comedians.  Whatever.  You could go into a million different ways.  The first couple seasons I really, really enjoyed.  Yeah.  Really enjoyed.  I think seasons one and two with Jay were great and I think they got a little greedy 
[00:52:00]  as far as wanting to push it into that season three.  Yeah, it was like three and a half or something.  Yeah, it was like season two and a half.  Yeah, they did two really successful ones.  Yeah.  Well, the ratings were so big that NBC ordered another one.  They rushed.  Immediately.  Too quickly.  Too quickly.  They rushed and it didn't do well at all.  And now they're trying to save the franchise and I tried because I love comedians and I 
[00:52:30]  can't watch the show.  I watched the first few and then last night I watched because Jim Norton was on.  I got to watch what Jimmy's up to.  And Jimmy did great and the show was pretty entertaining last night with the roast.  Yeah.  Jimmy was like the roast master.  Roast master.  General.  So the comedians that are still vying to be the last comic standing.  And what sucks about this contest is like whoever wins, you know there's comedians out  there that are so much better that didn't want anything to do with the show and that's  the biggest problem. 
[00:53:00]  That's the biggest problem.  If you're looking for the funniest person in America, it should be open for everybody.  Let's really have at it.  Yeah.  And see what these guys could do.  It's a lot of guys, God bless them, just getting started in the business and that's  fine and stuff.  But it's not that impressive when they win the title in my opinion.  No.  Ah.  Ah.  So they did a roast with the comedians that are still left.  And Jimmy was the roast master.  And the judges were Alonzo.  Alonzo Bowden. 
[00:53:30]  Who actually won season three.  And he's funny.  Yeah, yeah.  Alonzo.  He's a funny guy.  Phyllis Diller, who is just old and loves to laugh.  90.  She's going to be 90 in like a week.  Kind of love that.  And then Gilbert Gottfried, who's really, really funny.  Yeah.  Really funny.  You know, he's associated with Howard, unfortunately, because we would love to have him on the show.  Some of the funniest things back in, way, way back in the 80s and early 90s.  Some of the funniest radio you'd ever hear was when Gilbert was on Howard's show. 
[00:54:00]  But he's just, he's just the natural.  He's just really, really funny.  Things have changed.  He's just a funny dude, man.  And you've never met anybody quieter off stage.  And he appears to be meek.  He's just a little sweetie.  He's a quiet little fella.  Appears to be meek.  Yeah.  You think like, what is this guy?  And he's so despicable on stage and at a roast.  Yeah.  He really is a little filth ball.  We saw him at a roast.  And he just threw out one of the most offensive jokes ever about gay guys and having sex and byproducts and things like that. 
[00:54:30]  And it was really, really where the whole crowd just went.  Oh, that was at the.  Was it Trump or.  I didn't get to go to that one.  One before that.  Hugh Hefner?  Yeah, Hugh Hefner.  Speaking of comedians that are great at roast.  I was walking a block from my house to the Starbucks and I see someone.  It looks like Peter Boyle.  And I look closer.  It's Pat Cooper.  He lives like a block from me now on my street. 
[00:55:00]  Get out of here.  Is he yelling at you?  Note to Ben.  Get Pat Cooper back on the show, please.  Yeah, we love Pat.  We could never have him here.  We'll try.  Screw it.  We had him on our satellite show and he was one of the greatest guests ever.  That could be the funniest I've ever seen anybody be on radio was when he was on XM that day for an hour.  He went off.  Let's just have him in.  On everything.  Let's see what happens.  Let's do the walkover.  Yeah, let's have him in and see what happens.  Oh, he screamed about David Chase.  Al Dukes is going to be screaming about everybody.  Al Dukes is going to be sweating after Pat Cooper's appearance on this side of the show. 
[00:55:30]  Michael Strahan came in.  It was when we met Michael Strahan.  And Michael Strahan is a massive guy.  And he's just there.  He's there for 30 seconds.  And Pat goes, you're boring.  Screams at him.  Shut up.  Hovering over him.  Yeah.  You're hovering over me.  He's such an angry guy.  Yeah, he really makes me laugh.  You know, someone has to listen to this really fast because they just handed me some of the Pat Cooper stuff that he did for our satellite radio show.  Oh, Jesus.  I mean, it's a lot of Howard abuse, which was really, really funny. 
[00:56:00]  Maybe find something that is worth playing that's interesting to these folks.  It can be played.  Well, I think they bleeped it out just for this side of the show.  Before we move on.  It would be nice if we could give some of Howard's listeners some Howard.  Since, you know, he's been on vacation for how long?  I don't know.  Jesus Christ.  That is some gig, man.  He's been on vacation for...  Before the 4th of July.  It's got to be at least two weeks.  It was the week before the 4th of July. 
[00:56:30]  And then he's taking off the whole month of August.  Pat in Brooklyn, what's up?  Wow.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Listen, it's a funny story about the strip clubs.  One time, I went over to the strip club with a bunch of my friends.  Did you?  And one of the girls dropped a drink on my lap.  So she starts wiping it down with napkins they got there.  And it was dark days.  It was like a glow-in-the-dark kind of thing.  I went home.  I tried to get it off.  I guess it didn't work. 
[00:57:00]  So when I walked in, you know, everything's going fine.  I walked into a room where it was totally dark.  And my girlfriend sees this, like, glow on me.  And I had no way to explain it.  I had absolutely no way.  Yeah, how do you explain that you're glowing in the dark?  Honey, I was drinking toxic waste with my friends.  I'm like, how stupid to use those kind of napkins.  All right, I'm having a good time to tell you I work at the nuclear power plant.  Yeah.  Got a second job just to make ends meet.  But guess what happened with the copy machine today at the office.  That's right. 
[00:57:30]  And he just hangs up.  Pat, you were doing great.  That's it.  He knows.  He knows.  Punch out.  All right.  Leave on a high note.  Another Pat.  Let's get back to you.  We're just talking to you.  Well, you know.  Let's get back to The Last Comic Standing.  So Jim Norton was the star of The Last Comic Standing last night.  Anthony Clark, the host of the show.  I feel sorry for Anthony Clark.  He's a really funny guy.  Oh, yeah.  And you don't know it watching this show because he's not allowed to do any of his stuff.  He's just got to be host.  He's just a host just, you know, setting things up.  That's it.  Jay was allowed to do a little material. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, Jay did a lot of material.  I love that suit.  I love Anthony Clark, man.  He's just a mess.  And he gave me that suit jacket because I didn't have a suit jacket.  It was going to be kind of casual.  Of course you didn't.  And he goes, you want to wear a suit jacket?  I got a jacket.  And he made wardrobe.  Give me one of his jackets.  So that's why it looks like I'm wearing a jacket that should be on a svelter, more handsome man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I thought you looked too nice last night.  Did I look okay?  Well, I didn't see it, but people tell me I made love to the camera.  No, Jimmy did great.  So here's Anthony Clark bringing up wool Jimmy Norton. 
[00:58:30]  Hello and welcome.  Tonight, these comics are going to take on one of the friar's most time-honored traditions.  Leading them through the fiery pits of comedy is a man you probably know from the Opie and Anthony show.  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stage, your roast master, Jim Norton.  Jim Norton.  How cool is that?  I was applauding.  How cool is that?  NBC giving the plug for the show.  Nice.  Because a lot of times we try to get stuff like that done and you watch the final product and it's edited out.  Hey, it was cut out. 
[00:59:00]  What happened?  Yeah, what happened?  That's pretty huge, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Please.  Thank you.  Thanks, everybody.  I appreciate you all coming.  I think you're all in a good mood.  I hope you're feeling good.  Wow, that was nice.  Sorry, did I suck on the way out?  Hey, how are you?  Well, he's not funny.  What happened?  That was self-deprecating. 
[00:59:30]  No, he walked out and he wasn't even doing jokes yet, but the room was like so cold.  I'll tell you the vibe of the room when I first walked out.  But if you've ever been to a wake, remove the festive atmosphere.  It was when you say L.A. is just a different.  And here goes, boy, this is a concept number one.  Yeah.  But the friars in L.A., friars roasts are supposed to be vicious.  You're supposed to just trounce each other, man.  That's what roasts are. 
[01:00:00]  It's comedians.  This is how we interact.  This is what we think is funny.  And then you finish up and go, but you know, I love you and you're like a brother to me.  You give him a kiss on the cheek, you go back to your chair.  You brutalize him.  Everyone claps.  New York, they tend to get that a little bit more.  And there was no vibe in the room.  It was just like a...  Yeah, because again, it's weird with the cameras all pointing at you and there's no...  That has got to be weird.  Yeah, it kind of removes some of the spontaneity.  But L.A.'s friars hasn't figured that out as well as New York's.  Hmm.  I guess.  Yeah.  We're not on in L.A. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, wait.  Satellite.  Damn it.  So.  Yeah, so I have to acknowledge...  I mean, I've used that line before, but if someone doesn't answer when you say,  how are you, you've got to admit it.  Yeah, it was really uncomfortable.  Yeah.  It was a tough start, I'm not going to lie to you.  Yeah.  Because they looked like they weren't ready to laugh.  Absolutely not.  Are you ready to laugh?  Normally, I'll run out.  You guys have seen me live, and my normal thing, what I'll do,  like, we're doing these big gigs, and we're doing...  When's Boston?  That's the big one.  That's what, the 5th?  August 5th.  August 5th.  Yep.  August. 
[01:01:00]  August 5th.  August 5th.  DCU Center.  Yes, tickets available through Ticketmaster.  The O&A Traveling Virus.  Because I like to run out.  You guys know me.  Like, I'll run out, and I'll, like, do the clap thing with the audience.  Oh, yeah.  That's just a thing.  Hey, everybody.  Get the people up.  And, like, I clap, and I point at them, and I'm like, I'm clapping for them.  If you ever did that, I would kick you.  I would stomp you with boots.  Let me tell you how brilliant Jim Norton is.  I've seen Jimmy, it's got to be over 100 times now.  Yep.  He's got balls, because he'll walk out where you're, like, you're sitting in the audience, 
[01:01:30]  like, this guy can't possibly be funny, just how he's walking to the mic.  It is so uncomfortable.  You see people in the clubs and stuff, like, reaching for their drinks and their chicken  wings.  They're just so uncomfortable watching him walk up onto the stage.  And no other comedian has the balls to do that.  They all do the, hey, hey, what's up, buddy?  Yeah.  So how we doing, everybody?  Yeah.  Hey, you guys all right?  Hi.  Did you do that, Than?  No, Than is pretty cool, too.  Than does the sarcastic, you know, casual. 
[01:02:00]  Of course he does.  You know, star, too.  And they go, great, a male stripper.  We've been bamboozled.  Yeah, I always hated, I always hated balls.  And instead of trying to get the energy in the room, Jimmy will pretty much just go,  hey, how you doing?  Just really low-key, monotone.  And people are like, oh, we drove all the way from Jersey for this?  I got to build it.  I think if I can't build it with the material.  And I'm not talking about the people that know who Jimmy is.  They get it.  They already know. 
[01:02:30]  And then this is the beauty of Jim.  These people have no idea who he is.  He comes up with this delivery, like, hey, what's up?  Like, he doesn't want to be there.  He's miserable.  But by the end of his set, he's turned a lot of these people around.  He's got him.  Like, holy crap, this guy's funny.  Yeah, it's a matter of, I always hated cheerleading.  I don't like to cheerlead an audience.  You know, you shouldn't have to.  I always hate, and hosts have to do this, because when you first walk out, you're going to a cold room.  Hey, give yourselves a hand for coming out.  Why?  I will never clap for myself. 
[01:03:00]  That is the dumbest thing.  Give yourself, you've been a great audience, give yourself a round of applause.  No.  If I'm ever banging Beyonce, and someone sticks their head in the door and says, give yourself a hand, I will.  I'll clap for myself.  Then I deserve a round of applause.  But just for what?  Showing up at a comedy club, and crossing your stupid khaki pants legs, and challenging the comedian with your dumb face?  He loves this job.  Give yourselves nothing. 
[01:03:30]  How about have another drink, drunks?  You know, I've got to plug the Comedy Cellar here in New York City.  Oh, we love it.  I love Esty and the gang at the Comedy Cellar.  And let me explain, the Comedy Cellar is like the hometown club for all these comedians you know and love.  Yep.  So on like a Tuesday night, let's say, or a Wednesday night, like tonight, you'll see a lot of really famous comedians down there working out their material.  They all do about 15 minutes, right?  These insecure asses are out every night. 
[01:04:00]  Right.  Talking their wares.  I've seen Jimmy.  Modern day elixir salesman.  It's not the big gig for Jimmy, you know, where he's up for the performances.  He's working out material and stuff like the rest of the guys.  Jimmy will beat up the crowd and they have no idea that he's serious.  Like all of a sudden, in the middle of like his set where Jimmy knows he should be getting some laughs and it's material that he knows just kills anywhere else.  He's getting nothing.  All of a sudden, he'll just look at the crowd and go, I hate you. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  And then the people are trying to figure out where the joke is that the comedian is saying, I hate you.  No joke.  But they have no idea.  He really, really means it.  He just hates you.  And then he'll walk off stage and I've seen it a million times and walk past, he'll walk past me, let's say, or some of his other friends and just go, I hated them.  I hate them.  I hope they all die on the way home.  I've actually got into a habit.  Essie looked at me one time and I had to stop doing it where I would get so mad sometimes I started spitting on stage. 
[01:05:00]  Like as I was done with them, I had to let them know that like I dislike you people as much as you dislike me.  So if I bomb at the cellar, which I do sometimes, I would just say goodnight and then go on the stage and walk off.  It was the only way I could show them I meant it.  They spit on their own stage.  Sometimes a comedian bombs you'd offer to make the audience coffee.  I never understood it.  Jimmy spits on his own stage. 
[01:05:30]  I want some laughs.  Cigarette hijacking mix.  What am I, a schmuck on wheels, Henry?  Let's go to Katie in Philly listening to us on that fine radio station, WYSP.  Katie, what's up?  Hi, guys.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Jimmy, you looked beautiful last night.  Beautiful.  Thank you, Katie.  I haven't seen it.  You are a handsome young man.  Oh, people tell me that I'm really looking.  People tell me.  I remember one time I was being videotaped and the guy said, put your thumb in your mouth and suck it like a little girl. 
[01:06:00]  And he called me Coco.  And I had awful bosoms.  They looked like candy corns.  You ever see Irene Cara's Breast and Fame?  Horrid.  Two horrible candy corns.  Now, take your shirt top down.  Yeah.  She's trying to be groovy.  You made it.  I didn't mean to interrupt you with a 26-year-old movie reference that eight people got, four of which were in this room.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead, Katie.  That's the beauty of the internet, though.  They'll find it.  They will find it.  They'll find it, and then they'll laugh later.  Go ahead, Katie. 
[01:06:30]  Okay.  Opie and Anthony often reference, like, they try to give a visual.  You guys try to give a visual about what Jimmy looks like when he's looking at you and you guys are bombing a joke.  And, like you just said, he loves it.  He loves when people bomb jokes.  And we finally got to see that on Last Comic Standing when that blonde Ellen DeGeneres lookalike was bombing.  And then you see Jimmy's face and that smirk, and he was so happy.  Jimmy loves more than anything when we bomb on the show.  There really is nothing better than watching someone bomb as it's happening. 
[01:07:00]  It's fantastic.  But the thing is I also understand that they love what I do.  Yeah.  There was a moment on Tough Crowd one time where there were certain things we had to submit for Comedy Central.  Some things we didn't, and certain bits we had to submit for Comedy Central to look at.  And there was one joke I had submitted.  It was a question-answer thing.  And Colin saw it, and he found my answer so horrible, unfunny, and repulsive, he made them let me keep it. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, no.  And then when I did it, it got like a two from the audience.  And a couple people laughed, and he goes, no, no, no, just let them sit.  And he made the audience just sit there quietly while I soaked in my bum.  A couple of people have the nervous little titter for you trying to help you out, and he actually called them out?  Well, the punchline or something was, something about for Halloween, I dressed up like a Pac-Man.  I was going waka, waka, waka.  It was some awful.  I actually have it on DVD.  If I can find it, I'll bring it to the audio. 
[01:08:00]  And he goes, did you just say you were like the Pac-Man going waka, waka, waka?  And I really should have had a nozzle hanging off my vinegar smell.  All right, Katie, thanks.  Thank you, guys.  All right, we got one of these.  John in Chicago, yes.  Yeah, man, hey, I don't get you.  You know, I listen to Man Cow, and I try to listen.  I got my XM over the weekend, and I tried to give you a chance.  I just don't get it.  Can you help me out here?  What do you listen to now, though? 
[01:08:30]  John, this is...  I love you guys.  Oh, man, I was ready to go.  I wanted to go today.  You got to bait him a little first.  I love you guys for E-nos, many more E-nos.  All right, thanks, John.  Thank you, jackass.  Hey, God, it's good.  I really want to go after someone today.  I hate the fake guy that hates us, guy.  I always know when Ops Trader just unload on somebody, because he'll go, you know, and  then he'll, like, move the mouse a little bit.  I don't know what that is, but that's almost like, all right, let's shake everything loose  and allow some 35-year-old venom to spill out of me. 
[01:09:00]  That just clears the OCD.  Clears all the OCD thoughts out of my head and gets me prepared to attack.  All right, one more clip before we go to break.  I mean, this break, I love this show, because we get nothing accomplished.  We really don't.  No, we never get to anything.  You know, we have, like, ten things we wanted to do today.  We haven't even done one.  Maybe we did, like, one and a half so far.  This whole break, we were supposed to do the audio from last comic stand.  I got all distracted by Jimmy's sparkle face.  A lot of people tell me I'm pretty. 
[01:09:30]  I make love to the camera like Greta Garbo.  Put your thumb in your mouth like a little girl, Jimmy.  Hey, Bruno, man.  All right, here's the deal.  We'll play one more clip, and then we'll do the rest of the last comic standing clips  featuring Jim Norton after the break.  That's what we're going to have to do.  Very good.  Including the clip of that chick, the Ellen DeGeneres-looking comic that bombed horribly.  And the dude, you know who's a funny guy?  Chris Porter, really funny.  He's really a funny guy.  And the guy who has, like, cerebral palsy, I had never seen him work before. 
[01:10:00]  And even though maybe they liked him because he had cerebral palsy, he's funny, man.  He is funny.  He's got some chops.  Yeah, he's a good act.  What Gilbert Gottfried said about him, though, do you have what he said about Chris Porter,  hopefully?  I think so, yeah.  Okay.  We'll see.  We just got the highlights from the show.  We're not going to play an hour worth of audio, obviously.  We're playing an hour worth of audio with commercials.  But here's Jim.  Why are you holding yourself?  I'm holding my pants, not my pants.  I don't know.  All I see, you're holding your pants.  I'm holding, like...  You know where your fly is on your pants, and it's the little flap that covers up the zipper? 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  Jimmy is grabbing that and tugging on it.  It looks like I'm grabbing myself, but I'm really not.  It's almost like standing with your hands in your belt loop.  There's no reason for it.  It was just something like my hand hit the material, and I just held it.  It's like a little hand thing just to put it somewhere?  Yeah, there's no weird thing.  I'll do something else if you prefer.  I'll just rub like that.  Wear a vest and put your hand in it like Napoleon.  I'm like Napoleon in a peep booth.  Napoleon boner part.  Oh, stop with the language, young man.  Language, young man.  This is still my home. 
[01:11:00]  You should have to do the show with a straight jacket on because it's so weird what you do  with your hands.  You're right.  You don't know what to do with your hands.  I don't know.  I look over...  Whether you're acting or just hanging out, you don't know what to do with those silly  things.  I carry on a conversation with the young man, and he's just...  His hands are all over himself.  Well, for people who have power talk, normally what I'll do with my hands is this.  Stop dancing.  Now we can't even play this clip before break.  We better.  We better.  Oh, let's play it.  All right.  So, Jim Norton is the host of The Roast on Last Comic Standing last night, and here's 
[01:11:30]  Jim introing the judges.  Here are the three celebrity judges.  To be very honest with you, the first one really needs no introduction.  She was a pioneer in comedy.  There's Phyllis Dillon.  Why didn't you go after her?  I probably did, and they cut it.  Oh, really?  I think so, yeah.  Because I was kind of shocked.  I'm like, that's not like Jimmy.  No, I might have.  I mean, he'll show someone some respect, but he'll also, like, get a little jab.  I don't remember.  I might have made fun of her before or after.  Sometimes they edit, dude.  So they might have just... 
[01:12:00]  You think you went after her, though?  Because I was surprised.  Oh, I know I made fun of her, sure.  I might have been after, though.  I don't think...  Kick her in her cinnamon stick thigh.  Let me play it again, because I let it crack.  Listen, you might be able to hear a little bit.  No, I don't think...  They must have cut that out.  Maybe it was too mean.  Might have been too mean for NBC.  You know, it happens.  Here are the three celebrity judges.  To be very honest with you, the first one really needs no introduction.  She was a pioneer in comedy.  There's Phyllis Dillard.  Yeah.  They cut out where you called her an old C. 
[01:12:30]  The next judge is a comedian and actor we all know from the blockbusters like the amazing  Floydini.  Please welcome Gilbert Godfrey.  And going in order of fame, your final judge.  He won season three of Last Comic Standing, which occurred 25 minutes after season two. 
[01:13:00]  Please welcome Alonzo Bowden.  See, I'm...  This kid's good.  Yeah, so I obviously made fun of Phyllis.  I just don't remember what I said.  I probably have it written down, so I write down, like, you know.  Yeah.  But so I...  And they probably just cut it.  Maybe they cut it for time.  I don't think they would edit it for me.  Unless there's something about her being really old.  Here's the rest of the clip.  Oh, she is.  For those of you that don't know Gabriel, he's actually a pretty well-known guy.  He's certainly not an amateur.  He has a huge following.  And they're all Mexicans, which is great, because he shows up at a club.  He just does his act in the kitchen. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, we should have mentioned that.  We should have mentioned they're roasting one of their fellow comedians there, who's  the big, fat Mexican guy.  Yeah, and I would have, like, you know, a couple lines for each one, or one line for  each one.  I didn't want to, you know, whatever.  We'll do one more before we take a break.  Josh Blue, this is the guy with the cerebral palsy.  Yes.  Who's actually...  We hate...  He needed the money!  I'm not a big fan of comedians that use their affliction to get laughs. 
[01:14:00]  You know, you hope that they have something else besides that, but he seems to have something  else besides that.  What's his name?  I kind of like him.  Josh Blue.  Yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen, he needed the money!  We got it!  Andrew Dice Gay?  Later on the show, maybe?  Hey, maybe?  Me and you?  No.  The bitch room?  Huh?  Couple of men? 
[01:14:30]  You hear me?  I hear you.  Ladies and gentlemen, please help me in welcoming your first comedian, Josh Blue.  Hit!  Oh, thank you.  How's it going?  Very convincing.  All right.  This is weird for me.  It's like roasting the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.  Apparently, you've already been roasted.  You're so toasty brown and delicious.  They say you are what you eat. 
[01:15:00]  That poor Vietnamese family.  Gabriel doesn't know when he picks up ladies until he gets home and shakes.  So, did you get a lot of money for your tusks?  Oh, wow. 
[01:15:30]  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  How many people see you when they're high and immediately quit?  There you go.  Jim Norton from Last Comic Standing last night.  We'll do the rest of the clips after the break.  By the way, my intros are making me sick.  My, uh...  Why?  Just my...  Hey, God bless!  How about a nice hand for your next, uh...  What?  It sounds great.  It sounds just like you always sound on stage.  Yeah, exactly.  Mr. Pete Pleasant. 
[01:16:00]  Hey, how about the next guy?  God love him and save him.  God, what a borscht belt douche I'm turning into.  Thoughts and praise.  Ugh.  All right.  We'll continue in just a bit.  Obviously.  Because we're...  Yes.  We have nowhere else to go.  We can't go anywhere.  Nowhere else to go.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hi.  I just got wowed.  It was great.  I'm not supposed to talk about it, though.  I gotta go now.  Introducing the Opie and Anthony Wow Line.  If you get wowed, we want to hear about it.  Call 866-WOW-ME-05. 
[01:16:30]  That's 866-WOW-ME-05.  And tell us all about it.  And if your message isn't too stupid, we might just play it on the air.  Opie and Anthony!  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show on this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Make sure you get your WOW stickers on your cars and your trucks and your bicycles.  On your little scooters.  Your big wheels. 
[01:17:00]  Your big wheels.  Put them on whatever you got that rolls.  Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Yes.  There are women out there.  Oh, by the way, ladies, thanks for calling like we asked you to.  There are women out there that will flash you.  Thanks for proving us wrong.  No, it's happening.  I don't know if we have time to play all these clips, so I wanted you to.  Is there a couple we can blow off?  Can I thank my friend Rob Bartlett?  I got an instant message.  You are LOL on LCS.  Oh.  Thank you, Rob. 
[01:17:30]  From the I Missed in the Morning.  Yes.  Yes.  Rob Bartlett.  He's great.  He's a good boy.  Give him a little kiss on his face.  All right, where were we?  Last Comic Standing, yes, with Jim Norton, last night on NBC.  Norton.  Let's get right back into it, shall we?  Yeah, we should, because we've got a lot to do today.  This article from the Columbus Dispatch.  Oh, hilarious.  Have you read some of this yet?  The Grego Show.  Yeah, it's just really enjoyable.  A drive-by flagging.  Oh, there's some stuff to goof on today. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, boy.  All right, Last Comic Standing.  They roasted one of the comics last night on the show.  The Fat Mexican comic.  I guess he's huge out west.  I don't know.  Yeah, he has a big following.  I don't know much about him.  A lot of the Mexican comics, big out west.  NBC brought Jimmy in.  With their peeps.  To be the roast master.  And we're in the middle of the audio here.  The next comic coming to the stage was Kristen Kaye.  She looks like Ellen DeGeneres, basically.  Right.  She's very, very thin.  Extremely thin. 
[01:18:30]  And she bombed horribly last night.  Listen to this.  When I first met Gabe, I was kind of jealous,  because he's so successful and he's well-established.  And I'm a young comic that's having trouble getting my foot in the door.  But then I thought, well, Gabe has trouble fitting through the door,  so I'll let it go.  You know what I like about Gabriel?  I like that he doesn't fit into the Mexican stereotype.  He's not too lazy to steal.  Food off of anybody's plate. 
[01:19:00]  Food off of anybody's plate.  Wow.  Tough room.  That's a beating.  A shellacking.  That's a beating right there.  And she had the line of the night.  I don't think they've shown me.  She had the funniest line of the night.  Even though she bombed.  She said, Gabriel Iglesias, you look like Ralphie May rolled in Dat Fan.  That is a brilliant description of Gabriel Iglesias. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  They didn't use it.  Yeah, that was a damn funny line.  Wow.  She bombed.  Oh, she took a fat one.  Moving on is the guy that should win the whole thing if they're going to do this right.  A guy named Chris Porter.  Very funny.  Is he from New York?  I don't know.  I've never heard of him or met him, but I thought he was really good.  I don't know this, Chris Porter.  I don't know what he does.  That's right.  Tell him you don't want to do a contest with him.  He'll understand.  Believe me.  Knowing how these things work, he's not going to win.  He should win.  Chris Porter should win the whole thing.  It's very obvious.  He might, though.  He's kind of a goofball. 
[01:20:00]  People, he's likable.  You know, he's got what they want, but he's a funny guy.  All right.  This is him from last night, obviously, with Jim at the end.  Jim Norton's a great guy.  He actually lives in my neighborhood.  I know this because the judge made him come tell us.  Hmm?  Hmm?  Hmm?  Phyllis Diller?  We've got Phyllis Diller here, and I couldn't be more excited.  I've read all about you in the encyclopedia.  That's funny. 
[01:20:30]  If you don't know Kristen Key, you will.  She's about to make a name for herself as a poor man's Ellen DeGeneres.  But back to Paul Rodriguez.  Yes.  We all know he is the rock that chased Indiana Jones.  Jesus, don't we don't have.  He doesn't have his naysayers.  Some people think he's nothing but a fat, ugly piece of ****.  And while the truth may be on their side,  they are not going to stop this man. 
[01:21:00]  He will survive for at least another three years.  He has the distinction of being the only comic visible from space.  I think he's cute, but I'm into big ****.  And he kept going back and going, but back to it,  and then calling him different Mexican names.  He was Paul Rodriguez or James Alamo.  It was really funny, man.  All right.  One more clip worth playing.  Wow. 
[01:21:30]  She is Phyllis Diller, though.  I loved her in Mars Attacks.  You've got to give it to her, though.  She's going to be 90 in five days.  Comedians have a long shelf life.  What, the coffin in the silk pillow?  Gilbert is worth playing, too.  The last clip from last night's last comic standing.  Gilbert Gottfried, what do you think about comic standing?  Before I get to any of the contestants, Phyllis Diller, 
[01:22:00]  I think I speak for everyone when I say,  she's dead, isn't she?  Well, Josh, I think your material's so weak,  you better go blind, too.  That's the line.  That's the cerebral palsy guy?  Yeah.  Rebecca, don't flatter yourself.  The fact that Alonzo said you were beautiful,  he just means you were white.  Anyway, I don't want to put down any of you 
[01:22:30]  because one of you might become really successful  and I'm going to need your help.  So whoever loses, it's because of these two schmucks.  And there you have it.  He had a funny line about Chris Porter, too.  He said something about,  I loved you when you were in that band with Paul Simon.  And if you see him, he looks just like stupid Art Garfunkel. 
[01:23:00]  Art Garfunkel.  Art Garfunkel.  Good job, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Very good job.  I felt I was handsome.  You did well.  You definitely did.  All right, what's the latest on Dr. Boom?  Moving right on to other things.  What's the latest?  Well, all right.  A little latest.  Well, yesterday they called him Dr. Doom.  Well, they keep going to the news keeps like saying more indications that this was a suicide.  More.  Everyone knows what this was.  Case closed.  Done. 
[01:23:30]  And apparently they found that where the gas pipe hooks up to the meter had been disconnected and some pipe fitting had been put in there with a valve and a hose running down into the basement.  So at any time you wanted, you could turn this valve and fill the basement up with gas.  Wow.  I don't think that happens accidentally.  I don't think some pipes fell off a shelf and affixed themselves like that.  So this guy pretty much confessed to it in writing in the letters. 
[01:24:00]  The email or whatever.  The rubble.  Yeah.  You know, she's going to go from being a gold digger to a rubble digger.  Rubbish.  Rubbish digger.  Rubbish.  Rubbish.  Using that olden terminology.  Rubbish.  Well, the front.  Yeah, it's pretty much this guy did it.  The front page of the Daily News, it's tragic.  Dr. Doom's ex-wife on blast that nearly killed former hubby.  She looks like Tom Berenger in that photo from the side.  Look at the one from the side of the Daily News. 
[01:24:30]  I'm going to take a personal interest in making you suffer.  Wow.  She really does.  Oh, what an awful woman she is.  Cordula.  At least she has a beautiful name.  Something happens to women when they get older.  They start looking more and more like men.  Something's going on there.  And then the New York Post, congratulations.  You guys won the front page headline.  Headline of the day.  Little contest we do every day amongst ourselves.  Honey, I blew up the house. 
[01:25:00]  Dr. Boom's wife says it's tragic.  And on page three, Anna Kornikova is anorexing.  So you're going to kill Cordula, are you?  Wait.  I know a little something about death.  Y'all love Cordula.  Y'all want to kick ass.  Here's the latest on Dr. Doom. 
[01:25:30]  Investigators looking into this week's building explosion in Manhattan say it's becoming more evident that the plan to blow up the townhouse came from the Hull.  The music.  Box 5's Catherine Craig on the Upper East Side right now with the very latest details.  What are we hearing?  I wish they would have used the Benny Hill music.  Listen to the music.  Dude, it is like there's this horrifying, like Nightmare on Elm Street or Halloween music. 
[01:26:00]  I mean, more evident that the plan to blow up the townhouse came from the homeowner himself.  It's an action movie.  Box 5's Catherine Craig on the Upper East Side right now.  Get out of the way.  Get out.  The building's going to blow.  Die.  Die.  I'm Cordula Barter.  Get out of the house.  It's going to blow.  Jesus Christ.  It's the news.  It's not the news.  It's supposed to be.  They're still calling themselves the news. 
[01:26:30]  The news doesn't have a soundtrack.  It's an entertainment program.  People still think it's the news.  There's nothing newsy about it.  No.  Box 5's Catherine Craig on the Upper East Side right now with the very latest details.  What are we hearing at this hour, Catherine?  Oh, Lucy, investigators have a lot of work to do still here at the site.  Also, they want to question the doctor who lived in that townhouse.  But as you said, it is becoming even more evident that this gas explosion was no accident. 
[01:27:00]  During a press conference, the chief fire marshal presented a picture showing a pipe.  The one on the left, he said, was rigged to flood the townhome with gas so it would explode within minutes or hours.  Investigators say Dr. Nicholas Bartha was the only person found in the home after the explosion.  Right now, he is in a medically induced coma, and investigators have had limited conversations with him.  No kidding.  Sounds like Ben Sparks.  Medically induced coma. 
[01:27:30]  No one's had contact with him.  No kidding.  Unless you want to hear a lot of this.  Let's say hi to Jim in Boston listening to us on WBCN.  Jim, what's going on?  I'm an XM fan, I'm not going to lie.  But on what page of the post did they happen to mention the eight simultaneous train bombs that happened to kill hundreds of people? 
[01:28:00]  Oh, right.  I know.  That happened too far away for us to really care.  It's six.  Are we at that point now where we just don't care about that stuff?  Far away.  Far away doesn't matter.  Doesn't matter.  If it's a white country, it's okay, though.  No, no, no.  Even far away white country, it doesn't matter.  If it's far away, we'll show dead people and stuff like that.  If it's close, then you can't show any dead people.  If it's far away, it doesn't really make the front page.  We're easy to make that. 
[01:28:30]  Dude, we're not biased.  And the papers aren't biased.  Although England made the front page.  Page 21.  Well, Newsday threw it on the front page today.  Page 21.  Racist fiend is guilty and maul slaying.  The guy who targeted a white lady and killed her.  Page 21 of the post.  Fat Nick was on the cover for hitting somebody with a bat.  For days on end.  All right, you know what?  Here's the New York Post for you.  So the front page is, honey, I blew up the house.  Okay?  Page three is Anna Kornikova, maybe anorexic. 
[01:29:00]  She's scary skinny looking on the court.  She looks great.  I think she was getting a little chunky.  So, so far, nothing on the bombing.  Then we have page four and five doing the whole Dr. Doom, Dr. Boom thing.  And on page seven, someone is trying to say that David Guest likes African-American women.  Who?  David Guest.  Stupid Liza Minnelli's ex-wife.  Alleged homo.  He was...  David Guest.  Yeah, Liza Minnelli was his beard or whatever.  Yeah. 
[01:29:30]  And on page six, here we go.  Page six, they got the bombings.  Oh, there it is.  All right.  One hundred and ninety are killed in railway carnage makes page six.  We don't care that much because it happened way over there.  Yeah.  Page 21.  That's just how it works.  Good day, fellas.  See you, man.  All right.  They got a lot of people over there in India, too.  So, it doesn't really matter.  Six million ride the railways.  Do they?  That's a lot of people.  A hundred and ninety people.  It's on page six.  After Anna Kornikova is on page three. 
[01:30:00]  Because she looks skinny.  She's pretty.  Everyone at the post should die.  She's pretty.  And you wonder why the rest of the world hates us.  I mean, we got our priorities messed up sometimes.  It really is true.  We do kind of, like, present ourselves, like, very self-important in the world.  Look, we're interested in looking at a hot picture of Anna Kornikova, but can't you  help us out here and throw it on, like, page ten and make sure the...  It's a full page.  Make sure the bombings in India are a little more important.  The second you move the page that says, honey, I blew up the house, you get Anna Kornikova. 
[01:30:30]  Anna Rexick turns bouncy into bony.  Scary skinny look on court.  Yeah, that's the next page.  It's important.  It is important.  All right.  More Dr. Boom audio.  Bartha, distraught over his divorce, was ordered to sell the home.  Investigators want to determine whether Bartha made changes to that main gas line.  Campering.  There's no reason for this to happen, for this to be there. 
[01:31:00]  None whatsoever.  How could he do something like this?  You know, when so many people could have been hurt.  The damage it's caused.  It did.  You wonder where people's minds are.  What are they really thinking?  And at this point, there's no word when 62nd Street between Madison and Park Avenues will reopen.  And as you can see, their cruisers are still taking away rubble from the town hall.  And you wonder what people were thinking.  I think I know what he was thinking. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  It begins with a C.  Yeah.  And I got to say, look, I understand that she's an ugly nothing divorcing him, but he would have probably gotten $4 or $5 million for that.  And he's 66.  It's like, dude, just...  You think?  Well, if you split it, it's a $10 million place.  Were they splitting it?  I'm sure they would have.  Because it seemed to me that it looked like she was going to get the whole thing.  No, he wouldn't have been ordered to sell it then, I don't think.  No?  If he was going to get the whole thing.  Probably to split it.  How else would you buy it?  He sounds like an ass, too.  This next clip is pretty interesting.  Oh, a lot of the stuff that I read, he just sounds like a creep. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, they both sound like they're just people you would never want to meet, ever.  Have tea with.  Yeah, exactly.  I was trying to come up with something real fast.  Have tea with anybody.  I just couldn't accomplish that either.  Live on the Upper East Side, Catherine Craig, Fox 5 News.  Lucy?  And Catherine, the explosion at Dr. Bartha's townhouse is just part of a long divorce story.  An appellate divorce ruling came out last year.  It says the doctor intentionally traumatized his wife, a Holocaust survivor. 
[01:32:30]  With swastika, swastikas plastered on articles and notes.  It also says he ignored his wife while she was undergoing breast cancer treatment.  Ah!  Jeez.  Someone was able to slide over everybody's radar and pick up that he was a nut job.  There should be a moral in there.  Anybody getting divorced, say, hey, wait a minute, stop the America round.  The 66-year-old doctor reportedly hid in caves to escape the Nazis in his native Romania. 
[01:33:00]  Huh?  Well, back in the day, yeah.  Back in the day.  Back in the day.  How old?  He's 65?  66.  Yeah.  66?  Yeah.  How old was he?  Probably a little boy.  Jeez.  Let's say hi to Jody in New Jersey.  We don't want to do math.  You say how old is he when math is easy, and I go probably a little boy.  19, uh, five, even.  I could do the quick math from there.  14, 15.  Yeah.  At the end of the war, right?  40.  When did the war end?  Talking to the tail end.  No, no, no.  He was five in 45. 
[01:33:30]  He was born in 1940.  If he's 66 now.  Well, I went the other.  Oh, yeah, you're right.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, because I missed the whole decade.  Six, and you missed.  And I can't add either.  It doesn't matter.  We couldn't do it.  At least you tried.  At least you did that, damn it.  You were like McMurphy trying to pick that sink up.  Let's say hi to Jody.  Jody, what's up?  Hi, what's up?  Hi.  I'm at 287 looking for wow stickers for people to flash, but I haven't seen any.  This is an outrage.  See? 
[01:34:00]  I'm telling you, the women are out there.  She's driving around looking for wow stickers so she can give a little treat.  Supposed to be the good start to my day, but haven't found any yet.  And how big are you?  What was that?  How big are you?  How big am I?  Oh, gee.  That's nice.  Okay.  D.  D is fine.  I want to know the number.  The number?  38.  I'm in a black pickup truck with a wow sticker.  She's not going to say what the number.  No.  I hope he's assuming you have a big back.  What's the number? 
[01:34:30]  D.  CD nice.  What's the number?  34.  Wow.  Okay.  You get to stay on the phone.  All right, Jody.  Good luck.  She's looking around, guys.  I'm looking.  I haven't found any.  What road are you on?  On 287, New Jersey.  Give me an exit, something.  Something to go with.  Exit 39.  Okay, there you go.  Cool.  All right.  Let us know if you get lucky out there.  All right.  Thanks.  All right.  By the way, I'm looking for a girl who's a 38A to marry. 
[01:35:00]  Holy crap.  Why don't we freaking ever get the obvious?  Why?  Look at.  Oh, wow.  Wayne in Bay Ridge.  Opie Anthony, Jim.  How are you guys?  Hi.  You're going to have the observation of the day.  Okay.  Here we go.  You ready?  Yeah.  Well, I kind of think it was the Indian bombings being that it was yesterday.  If you look at yesterday's date, which was?  7-11.  And who owns the 7-11s?  7-11.  Wow.  Most of them owned by Indian gentlemen.  Well, there you go.  It was a holiday and they blew their asses up.  I got to go to a conspiracy webpage, man. 
[01:35:30]  There you go.  You only get that from Bay Ridge.  Yeah.  I was just going to say, leave it to someone from Bay Ridge, Brooklyn to notice that.  7-11, right?  Dude, have a good day, everybody, man.  All right.  Bye.  All right, Wayne.  I didn't notice that.  We're too busy being handsome and cute.  We're dumb.  All right.  Listen, we got a great article we got to get into next.  Why doesn't he do subtraction?  Why don't I do it?  And why do you think that he was 51 years old when the Holocaust happened?  None of us know what we're doing.  We're all stupids.  We're all stupid people. 
[01:36:00]  Three asses.  We got mics in front of us.  And Kenny is continuing to shave, by the way.  I don't like to be an accident, liar.  Kenny said his mustache shaving was an accident.  It fell off during a fist fight.  What happened?  Why do you keep shaving?  Because Opie was very complimentary to me.  Wait, just start over.  I shaved because Opie was very complimentary to me.  Which is very rare, so he really took it seriously.  You said it looked good?  Yeah, man.  No, he needs the cop mustache thing going. 
[01:36:30]  That was like cop.  The 70s porno mustaches.  Mustaches are starting to come back a little bit.  But it's 70s porno or cop.  The mustaches are starting to come back a little bit, but you have to kind of grow it, let it drop a little bit on the sides.  Well, that's pretty, like a fog hat.  What do you got?  I'm telling you.  The fog hat.  That's coming back a little bit.  Molly Hatchet, kind of.  But the tight 70s porno mustache is just not a good look for me.  The Dave Wanstead look. 
[01:37:00]  Nice.  I'm scared of reference.  I think you should grow it back.  Okay.  Because you look more like an authority figure with it.  Okay.  That's a good suggestion.  Now you just look like a big dope.  Yes, you're right.  But the mustache, you're authoritative, authoritative big dope.  He doesn't care about your life.  You've got to listen to me.  No.  Well, you know what?  He really doesn't care.  I'll grow half a side for Anthony, and I'll shave the other half for you.  Could you just grow, instead of that, grow half of one, but right in the middle? 
[01:37:30]  I hear you.  Just a little one.  I saw one of those at Rue 57.  No, you didn't.  Last week after the clerk's tooth created.  Is that making a comeback, that mustache?  No way the Hitler mustache comes back.  We walked by, and we all could not believe what we were seeing.  It was a Hitler mustache on an older gentleman.  I swear to you.  How much time has to pass before that?  Because everyone was wearing those back in the 30s and 20s.  All the guys had them.  Little Charlie Chaplin.  This guy's probably just defiant. 
[01:38:00]  It's like, I'm not taking my Hitler mustache away.  I don't care what he did.  I like how I look with this thing.  I want Kenny to get an Amish beard.  Oh, that would look good.  I want you to grow an Amish under the neck only, under where the chin would be.  Nope, the chin strap beard.  Go big beard.  All right.  It's all gray.  That's why I couldn't do the Fu Manchu thing.  Diet red.  Fu Manchu.  I want you to diet red.  I want you to be fiery, Ken.  Call you red beard.  All right.  Yeah.  We'll see what we can do. 
[01:38:30]  There's nothing that's going to improve me, though.  Oh, come on.  You're cute.  Thank you.  Boring.  We got a great article from the Columbus Dispatch we'll get into, and hopefully we'll also  talk about the Tom Cruise baby thing.  Where is it?  Everyone wants to know.  We could do this and this after the break.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  I love showing my introverted fat guys to whip them out Wednesday. 
[01:39:00]  Hear what everybody else is talking about.  ONA, uncut, and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah.  Hi.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  We say hi to Columbus today.  The Big Wazoo.  Hi. 
[01:39:30]  We're all getting together.  A bunch of men with some listeners at FH Riley's this Friday night.  Friday.  Oh, yeah.  It's a karaoke party night.  We did one of these back three or four months ago.  It was a huge success.  It's a small place, by the way.  It's a madhouse.  It's very rare you get to see Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton in a very, very intimate setting like FH Riley's.  Yes.  Right.  But you can't talk to us.  And we're going to have stuff to give away. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, supposedly.  Like Free FM's going to send the van and shirts and stuff.  XM's sending us stuff.  Yeah, a lot of stuff to give away, so make sure you're there.  Way to motivate everyone.  Wow.  We should have five people there at least.  We shaved Kenny's mustache into a baggie and we're raffling it off.  I don't sing.  Ant sings.  But Frank the Frowner, I understand, is going to be singing I Got a Brand New Pair of Roller Skates by Melody.  You've got to sing a song about smiling. 
[01:40:30]  I don't know if I know.  What's the song about smiling?  Ah, we'll figure one out.  It's a lot of fun.  Memories!  Like the corners of my mouth!  There is a song.  What's that song?  When you're smiling, the whole world smiles with you.  Oh.  When you're frowning, when you're laughing.  All right.  Thank you, Kenny.  We'll figure it out.  We'll do the heavy lifting from here.  Thanks.  Being non-specific.  What's that song with a smile in it, the chorus? 
[01:41:00]  Kenny, your job is to just set up the weights and then we do the heavy lifting, okay?  Just the opposite of real life, actually.  And get us a towel because we're going to get sweaty.  That's right.  Unless your sleeves are ironed.  It's just a hang with the listeners.  It's the restaurant I own with my brothers, even though I don't do anything for it.  I'm the silent partner.  Yes.  So we're going to be there.  It's called Late Night Karaoke.  We do it from time to time.  It's a cool hang.  It's FH Riley's 400 New York Avenue in Huntington Village there. 
[01:41:30]  What time?  Friday.  Like 10 o'clock.  10 p.m.?  Get there early, though, because like I said, it's a small place.  I'm going to eat.  We don't need to promote this, by the way.  So I don't think we're trying to promote it.  No.  It's a small place.  It's already going to be packed.  We're just mentioning it.  We can only fit 3,000 people in the first 2,000 listeners.  We're giving you $600.  All right.  The Columbus Dispatch.  Clean Air X.  Something big happened in Washington, and we're not nervous about it whatsoever.  No.  But there are being articles written about this all over the place. 
[01:42:00]  I think the Washington Post had one that we're going to be part of.  They had one that came out a couple days ago, but then there's another one that's going  to come out featuring us.  Basically, the fines have gone up drastically for radio broadcasters.  From $35,000 to $350,000.  Yeah, something like that.  It's important, though, because that's what you're worried about.  That gay marriage and video games is what the government should be concentrating on.  It's a really sad day because it's ridiculous, and a lot of people go, well, the pendulum 
[01:42:30]  will swing in the other direction eventually.  No, no one's going to take away these big fines, and that's why this is really, really  sad for radio in general.  Not for us, because we could adapt, and we'll still do edgy radio, and we still have the  I don't give a F attitude, and eventually we'll get fired again, and then you'll have  some other dopey radio guy.  Slappy and Wappy, we always said.  They're getting closer to having a Slappy and Wappy show with some of the names that  are out there.  Yeah, no kidding. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, there's some other.  The Grego Show.  Grego.  Yeah, at this point, I've got to remind people that I'm not called Opie for the radio.  I've been stuck with his dumb name since I was 12.  I'm not happy that I'm now in my late 20s, and I'm still called Opie for the late 20s.  I just called that.  All right, I'll admit to early 30s at this point.  It was funny the day when you said, well, yeah, I show up, and you're like, who's this  college student?  What?  Where are you showing up at the...  At the procurium meeting? 
[01:43:30]  Hey, that's funny.  I think that was pretty funny.  The beautiful part is it's funny to insightfully see how people view themselves, and that's  because you're very immature, and that's how you see yourself.  Yeah.  All right.  Childlike.  So we're not reading this article because we're taking this FCC thing seriously.  We think there's some really funny stuff in this article.  This first, second paragraph, it gives me the deuce chill.  The Columbus Dispatch.  Ohio's greatest online newspaper.  Oh, it's an online newspaper?  We don't need to read this. 
[01:44:00]  I thought people were actually reading this.  Is it really?  It's only online?  I don't know.  The internet's pretty popular.  Clean Air Acts.  Threat of hefty FCC fines has shock jocks on best behavior.  Shock jocks.  It's shocking.  Well, this is going to just thin the herd, because there's a lot of hacks doing radio,  and they're just known for just being shocking, and those guys will go away.  If you do the shocking stuff as attention getters, and then you give the people a show that  they enjoy for the most part, then they'll stick around. 
[01:44:30]  If all you were able to do is just shock radio, you're done.  You're done.  Man cow!  Oh, you tried, didn't you, man cow?  Aw.  How did that work out for you?  No one wanted to listen to him.  No one wanted to listen to you as a political talk show host.  Sorry, you got Hannity.  Those people want to listen to Sean Hannity.  I'm listening to Hannity.  Ah, the t-shirts weren't wet, and the people giving away promotions weren't naked.  So when WVQ, WLVQ, sorry, WLVQ recently hosted a Wags and Elliot drive-by flagging, 
[01:45:00]  the promotion seemed downright innocent.  Uh, what?  I think that's misspelled, it's a drive-by fagging, because that's what you have to  be to enjoy that show.  Fags and Elliot?  Yeah.  What are you giving away?  I shouldn't say that, because they probably hear that as much as we hear it, like Dopey  and Anthony.  It's a good point. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, but you wouldn't even attempt to do a Wags and Elliot drive-by flagging.  As they say, you can't out-Wags and Elliot, Wags and Elliot.  Here's the contest.  Did they say that?  Here's the contest.  Giving away food, shirts, and American flags.  After all, it's a long way from Toys for Ta-Tas.  Ho-ho.  The Morning Show's notorious annual stunt in which strippers flash people who donated  toys for poor children.  They're calling it the Morning Show's notorious annual stunt.  Unfortunately, that was the Morning Show's notorious annual stunt for about 200 morning 
[01:46:00]  shows across America.  Right.  Everyone did the toys for Ta-Tas.  I think we even did it back in the day, to be completely honest with you.  We were trying to do feels for meals.  Right.  But we could never get it passed by the lawyers.  Because they're calling it prostitution.  Yeah.  I still say we'll be able to do it on XM this year.  We want to, to benefit the homeless, we want to take a big refrigerator box, put a nude  girl in there, and cut out holes strategically placed by her upper end, and the guys can reach 
[01:46:30]  in and grab whatever they want, you know?  And then they have to leave either food or some money for the homeless, and it's feels  for meals.  Isn't that wonderful?  Well, but people don't want us to help the homeless.  They call it prostitution.  Wait a minute.  I've got to read this next paragraph, which is not highlighted, but it's...  No, we're reading the homeless.  Oh, you are.  Okay.  No, go ahead, Jimmy.  Read the next paragraph.  Some of the...  This is after the Donated Toys Report children.  Some of the Breakfast Club contestants have been scaled down...  Contests, contests. 
[01:47:00]  I'm sorry.  Contests have been scaled down, at least on the air.  WLVQ Morning Show producer Dan Orr said recently, when we're at Buckeye Lake, we have  a tan line contest.  If we do it at all anymore, it's off the air, and we won't be talking about it on the air.  A tan line contest you can't do on the air anymore?  Why?  Wow, they really backed off.  Who's entering that?  Nuns?  Why would you have that, you faggots?  You can still do a tan line contest. 
[01:47:30]  Of course.  Look, the tan line's on her back after this.  Unless the tan line starts halfway up the...  You've seen that.  Yeah.  I want to see the tan lines on Dr. Boom.  Tattered clothing pieces.  Patchwork tan.  Boy, Dan Orr, we won't be talking about it on the air anymore.  I didn't like the very beginning.  The Breakfast Club.  I just ignored that.  Some of the Breakfast Club contests.  Do they have a breakfast...  Is that what they call the morning show or something? 
[01:48:00]  I guess.  Because there are plenty of those around the country, too.  Ew.  We want to be a, like, franchise morning show where they have one in each city.  I want to be the Breakfast Club here.  I want to be the zoo crew.  I want to be the morning zoo.  Yeah, yeah.  Ooh, wow.  That's rough.  Madhouse.  Things are crazy going on.  Boy, that Buckeye Lake, though, sounds like a wild place.  They have tan line contests.  Ooh.  Here we go, guys.  Say so long to the era of outrageous radio stunts.  The article continues.  The toned-down offerings have emerged since June 15. 
[01:48:30]  Unless it's on Lacey Peterson and Connor.  The only tan line contest.  When President Bush signed into law regulations that increased tenfold to $325,000 each incident,  the maximum federal fine for indecency.  Stations have since ditched the trashy stunts.  Right.  And cautiously trotted out promotions more fitting for Sunday school groups.  Really?  Sunday school?  For example, for example, the Grego show on WBZX. 
[01:49:00]  Stop right there.  If I ever refer to myself as Grego.  Aren't you happy that that guy that came to you, was it a PD early in your career,  and said when you were going by the name Greg Opie Hughes, he said,  Look, you've got to pick something.  Yeah, that would have been Stan Mayne.  Yeah.  Do you think if he would have said it could be Greg, could be Greg Hughes, could be Opie,  could be...  Or if he suggested Grego. 
[01:49:30]  Never.  Do you think you would have mulled over Grego as a name?  Never.  Sure you would have.  You would have done commercials.  Hey, Grego, let go of my ego.  And you'd all laugh and elbow each other's ribs.  I'd be in a hot attic right now installing air conditioning because I could never work  with a Grego, no matter how lucrative the position.  Hello, everybody.  This is Grego.  Don't forget I'll be at the gas station this weekend pumping gas for a dollar two.  Dollar two.  Got to get there early.  Grego.  Kill me.  Grego.  So, the Grego show on WBZX. 
[01:50:00]  Is this a hacky contest?  Because this does sound really funny and interesting if they did it.  Do you think the production does that?  Lego, my Grego.  Grego in the morning.  Shoes.  Shoes.  Shoes.  Legos.  WBZX.  Lego, my Grego.  The Grego show.  Eggos.  How many Eggos can you fit in a shoe?  Shoe.  Call back anyone?  The Grego show on WBZX won't be repeating the contest in which the winning listener has sex 
[01:50:30]  in a helicopter while flying over the house of a former spouse.  I'm sure that was real.  Well, a lot of these hacky morning shows do the helicopter contest.  Another big one that morning shows do all over the country is throw your boss out of a helicopter.  Oh, yeah?  You hate your boss.  Because everyone hates their boss.  You hate your boss.  Because I said so.  Or actually, probably out of a plane, actually.  You throw your boss out of a plane, and obviously it's a parachuting thing. 
[01:51:00]  But you're so mad at the boss, and you get to...  I'm mad at him.  They do the broadcast.  He's throwing his boss out of a helicopter.  They pre-promoted...  This is crazy.  What does your boss do?  They pre-promote it for a couple weeks, and then there's the boss with his parachute on,  and you get to push him out of the plane.  But you don't really get to push him out of the plane, because then if something did happen,  there would be an official lawsuit.  Yeah.  So what do you do?  You do make believe that you're pushing the boss.  He jumps?  Yeah, he jumps, and they make believe you actually pushed him out. 
[01:51:30]  I hope the static line wraps around his neck.  Yeah.  Nor will WBZX return to Holiday Hooters.  The Holiday Hooters.  In which the morning crew gave away breast jobs for Christmas.  Why is that bad to give away breast jobs?  What's wrong with breast jobs?  Because it's a hacky bit to begin with.  All right.  Do you know something?  Maybe that's just...  Maybe there's finally the hacky police, and they said,  Look, man, stop giving away breast implants, please.  Thank God for the FCC's increased fines. 
[01:52:00]  That's all I can say.  Can I say this?  This is called, by the way, The Grego and Mo Show.  No, it's not.  Oh, yeah.  No, I will punch you in the face.  Uh-oh.  You cannot tell me that it is The Grego and Mo Show.  Hey, Mad Magazine feat, show the boss.  Mo gets a little...  It's a black guy and a white guy?  Yeah.  The white guy looks like James Hetfield, but bald.  Right, shaved head.  And he's got the big Pantera guy beard on. 
[01:52:30]  Yes.  What do you call a black shock jock?  Okay.  You know we can't use that word here on this.  The Grego and Mo Show.  That old gag.  What do you call a black president?  All right.  Why wasn't Mo in the Flintstones?  I get it.  All right.  Why isn't Mo in the Jetsons?  How do you babysit Mo?  How many Mo's does it take to shingle a ring? 
[01:53:00]  What do you call a black doctor that found the cure for cancer?  Ah, shut up.  We know that gag.  Anyway, so they're not going to do Holiday Hooters,  in which the morning crew give away breast jobs for Christmas.  They're more likely now to focus on a community issue.  Hey, it's the Grego and Mo Show.  Hey, Mo.  A community issue.  Yeah, that's just as much fun as giving away, like, stripper breasts.  Why I ought to...  Hey, Mo, when did you turn into an... 
[01:53:30]  Holy...  Mo's a...  Why I ought to...  Hey, Mo just stole my car.  It must be because now he's a...  Yes, I'm putting my own beeps in. 
[01:54:00]  See?  See, I can talk right over him, you...  Yeah.  Ass.  The beeps make it funny.  Can we have to explain this to you?  Oh, wow.  Is that good?  Look at the size of Mo's...  Must be because he's a...  Hey, Mo, you certainly do have a big fat...  Certainly. 
[01:54:30]  Grego and Mo.  Grego.  And this is coming from me.  I'm called Opie.  Your name is ridiculous.  Oh, what bag of...  I guess Opie is saying it.  Oh.  All right.  Continuing.  This article is just a gem.  We could do an hour on this, no problem.  Disc jockeys have become so careful that even family-oriented stations feel the heat.  Woody Johnson, host of the WCOL morning show, Woody and the Wake Up Call, recently said he 
[01:55:00]  was thinking about taking out a $500,000 insurance policy in case of an FCC fine.  Why doesn't Woody take out a gun and shoot himself?  That's why we're going to beat the crap out of every morning show in America, because they're  all scaredy cats.  Easy with the language, Opie.  Scaredy cats.  You know what Woody should take?  We have no fear here, Woody. 
[01:55:30]  Woody should take something out of a bag in the R. Bud Dwyer tradition.  Give himself a nice braining.  Nice big 357.  Even though WCOL airs country music and Johnson is popular partly because of his wholesomeness.  Oh, boy.  He still has to worry about the unexpected, said John Crenshaw.  Like what?  That he'll say something funny or interesting?  Program director.  Program director and fellow program host? 
[01:56:00]  Oh, that's got to be a treat.  Can you imagine doing a radio show with the program director?  That would be a treat.  Hey, can we give away oatmeal?  I don't know.  The part that I find slightly scary as an on-air performer, Crenshaw said, is if I'm broadcasting  live from a concert, for example, someone in the crowd is picking up using, uh, someone  in the crowd is picked up using language that would not be appropriate, and my control room  operator doesn't get to the dump button fast enough.  Well, why don't you relax?  Sport is sporting events not going to exist anymore because there's audiences there, you coward? 
[01:56:30]  Such a situation occurred the day after the FCC fine increase became law.  It involved the poster boys for radio stunts of questionable taste, Opie and Anthony.  See, but they get this all screwed up.  Of course they do.  As the duo did a live broadcast from the streets of New York, a Howard Stern fan shouted insults  at the broadcasters.  What?  After that?  I didn't curse.  And it wasn't on broadcast radio. 
[01:57:00]  Is he talking about the TV thing we did?  No, I think he's talking about...  When Howard had his farewell show?  Oh, a live broadcast from the street.  No, he's talking...  I think he's talking about when, uh...  Wait, the live broadcast from the streets of New York, insults at the broadcasters.  I think he's talking about the, uh, situation that happened recently.  Oh, with the Howard fan?  Yeah.  And by the way...  This situation...  This 93, Woody and the wake-up call, it's one guy who looks faggy, another guy who looks 
[01:57:30]  fat and gay, and a hole.  Oh, God.  This is awful.  They all have to have a hole.  Oh, let me see.  Oh, look at it.  Oh, oh!  I'd rather get a wake-up call as a teabagging from John Merrick.  If your favorite morning show has a hole, just stop listening now.  Oh, now?  Now, Woody!  They add nothing.  Cut your losses.  Now, Woody!  Add nothing but...  Oh, stop.  Cut your losses.  Guys, now... 
[01:58:00]  You know what my favorite morning show is?  Woody and the Asian Teenager.  We'll finish the article after the break.  Woody and the Angry Ex-Wife.  Why do the pictures of...  Get it?  Yes.  Why do the pictures of radio people have to be...  Do they have to be, like, all like they're a family or married or lovers or something?  Look at this Woody and the wake-up call.  They're all laying together.  One guy has his hand on the whole shoulder. 
[01:58:30]  Like he's comforting her.  Yeah.  There, there.  It's okay not to be funny.  And you can't see where both her arms are because the picture gets dark so they can put the logo there.  But look at where they look like her arms are going.  I know.  Looks like it's double the pleasure, double the fun over at the Woody and the wake-up call.  Hopefully they're on the wheels of her chair.  All right.  Here we go.  We've got to take a break.  It gets into us in this article, and that's what we're getting at here.  So we'll continue with the article from the Columbus Dispatch after these messages. 
[01:59:00]  I will ask you with Mount Wednesday.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We've got to go right to the phones.  It's Mike in Boston.  Mike, what's up?  How you doing?  Hey there, Mike.  Hey, Mike.  What do you say, Bill?  Hey, I just want to say, you guys are killing me with that Larry Fine stuff.  I almost drove off the side of the road.  You guys are killing me. 
[01:59:30]  The Grego and Moe show?  Of course Boston would love that.  Of course.  He loved that.  You guys rule.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  Hey, Moe killed my pregnant wife and threw her off the bridge.  Boston.  Boston.  Sorry, West Palm Beach.  We're not going to explain that one.  That was a national story a few years back.  All right.  By the way, I have to say the Woody and Wake Up call.  Yeah.  They did a contest.  Wait, what was it?  Giving a car away with bingo. 
[02:00:00]  What?  Why don't you get on mic?  What?  Why don't you get on mic before I slap you?  They were giving a car away by doing a bingo contest.  That's what we've come down to in radio.  What kind of bingo contest?  At a used car dealership, you get to play a car to bingo, and whoever got bingo won the car.  You're kidding, right?  Nope.  Like, if you like this show, here's the word.  Can I tell you what the old bit is?  What?  Because I'm a historian, as far as radio goes.  Are you?  The bit used to be where you invite everyone to a car dealership, okay? 
[02:00:30]  And there's, let's say, a hundred numbers down.  Got to touch the car and last one to take their hands off it?  Well, that one.  Okay.  No, not that one.  I was part of one of those as well.  No, this happened when the Bear Man did this in Buffalo when I was working up there.  So you got a hundred, let's call it a hundred numbers in a fenced-off area.  Yeah, and you give numbers away to all the listeners that came down, like, oh, I got  number 12, blah, blah, blah, okay?  Correspondent key, you go in and try to start it, and the right key starts the car, you win? 
[02:01:00]  Did that at WCMF many, many times.  I thought I had it.  You want to guess?  No.  One more guess?  If it's a minivan, you back it up onto a dock, and you wave goodbye as it throws a  glub, a glub, a glub.  Then you blame Mo for it.  So, everyone has the numbers, okay?  Hey, why are they pepper spraying Mo?  Oh, it must be because he's a...  He's a what? 
[02:01:30]  He's a...  What, what, what, what?  See, Tom, we know how to get around the rules.  Stupid rules.  Hey, Mo's carjacking the prize.  Holy...  Stupid rules and regs.  All right.  So now you got the listeners there, they all got a number, now you got to pick a number,  and that number's going to win the car, right? 
[02:02:00]  Uh-huh.  Bring in the cow.  Not cow bingo.  Bring in the cow.  What's cow bingo?  All right.  And then they bring the cow in.  Now I know.  All the numbers are laid out flat.  Right.  Right, I said that.  And the cow walks around.  And does what it has to do.  And whatever it lands on, that number wins the car.  And what the cow pie bingo, it's called, yeah, when the cow pie lands on a number, the corresponding  number.  I was such a nobody in this business. 
[02:02:30]  I had to do the research for that promotion, and I had to figure out how long it takes  a cow to do what it has to do.  From eating to full digestion.  And it turns out they are pretty much doing what they have to do pretty much every minute.  All day long.  That's why we slaughter them.  That's what sucked about...  Like tasty burgers.  That's what sucked about the contest, because then you got a handler that walks the cow around.  But the cow did what it had to do right away.  Contest over. 
[02:03:00]  Everyone goes home after promoting the thing for two weeks.  Kind of wrecks it.  Oh, yeah.  Within seconds, contest was over.  And that Woody, by the way, that Woody and Wake Up Call audience, they make our listeners  look like Ford models.  You've never seen a worse looking group of human beings.  Bingo.  Let's see.  You have a U, an N, a T, one letter left.  Do ya?  Let's go to...  An F, an A, two spaces, O-T. 
[02:03:30]  Hey, I got an N, an I.  Hey, Mo, what is this spell?  Oh!  Yeah, someone was reminding us about letting the lobster loose.  Yeah, that's another one they do.  Where?  In Buffalo.  Buffalo.  They promote that they're going to let the lobster loose, and I guess that's the start  of the weekend in Buffalo.  Yeah.  And all it is, after they promote it all week, and then Friday morning, all Friday morning  long, like, coming up, we're going to let the lobster loose, and then they play some 
[02:04:00]  sound clip from some movie.  From a movie with Steve Martin.  Is it a Steve Martin clip?  And that's all it is.  That's all it is.  Yeah, and then that's their big thing.  Booby Man from Brooklyn.  Wow, Opie, for being in your 20s, you sure know a lot about radio history.  Oh, wow, that's true.  You did say late 20s, early 30s.  Yeah, I'll admit to early 30s at this point.  Shannon and Columbus, what's up?  Hey, gentlemen, what's going on?  Hey.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Girl. 
[02:04:30]  Hey, the Woody and the wake-up call, their key, like, go-to bit, what they're known for  or whatever, is doing that hacky, call it, like, prank phone calls, basically, where  the, but it's always this Woody guy who's calling in and doing these different voices  and calling people at work and making them think that, you know, their car's broken down  or they're, I don't know, the grandma's dead.  Yeah, the set-up prank phone call.  It's horrifying.  Where are they?  Where are they?  They're in Columbus.  I can't remember what station they're on.  Oh. 
[02:05:00]  But they're in Columbus.  We would love to listen in.  Yeah, if you can.  We'll do that on XM.  We'll listen to some of these dumb morning shows in Columbus today.  Also on XM, as we go over there, I am really psyched today.  I think at, like, 10 or something here, or in an hour from now, Danny DeVito is calling  in.  Oh.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  The great Danny DeVito.  I'm really psyched.  The Danny DeVito.  Yes, to promote his new show.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, Shannon.  And also, the Columbus Dispatch is an actual newspaper, too.  Oh, it is.  I figured it was.  All right.  All right.  Then they talk about us, how we wrecked it for everybody.  It wasn't the first time listeners perked up their ears to Opie and Anthony. 
[02:05:30]  The two were fired from their radio show in 2002 after a stunt in which a couple allegedly  had sex in St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Wow, really?  Opie and Anthony found work two years later on satellite radio, and a few months ago added  an over-the-air syndicated show on CBS radio, the company that had fired them four years  ago.  Uh-uh.  Locally, the Opie and Anthony show airs on The Big Wazoo from 3 to 6 p.m., hours after  the show is produced live in the morning.  So the delay makes any accidents irrelevant for our markets, said Valerie Brooks, the station's 
[02:06:00]  market manager, we have double safeguards in place.  Double secret safeguards.  And then it just goes on and on and says, the content on Oprah is something that would  get most radio stations fined, which is true, by the way.  They get away with a lot more on TV.  We went through a tough time after that Opie and Anthony incident in the church.  The fallout was incredible.  Even adult contemporary stations, which don't get into that at all, got caught up in the 
[02:06:30]  fallout.  Those stunts are typically rock radio bass, but we all got the memos.  And then we talk about later in the article how we think we took the whole stunt thing  as far as you can.  Hugh said...  I don't remember this quote from me.  Anthony said, I think they were getting tacky anyway.  I think they were getting tacky anyway?  You would never say that.  I don't use the word tacky.  Not at all.  That's tacky.  So many jocks you find trying a shock, it really bores people quickly. 
[02:07:00]  And then they end the article with the radio stunts that may be a thing of the past.  Yeah.  Let's go through this really fast.  Where is this?  I don't have that.  Oh, this is great, too.  You don't have this?  Radio stunts such as these might be a thing of the past.  Breast implant giveaways.  Yep.  Those were big.  Those were big.  And Howard used to brag about this.  Every radio station in America did it.  And Howard did not do it first.  I invented it.  He did not do it first. 
[02:07:30]  Invented it, Robin.  Breast implant giveaways.  Known under various names, the contest have served as a Christmas highlight for WBZX.  Screw over your ex.  Another WBZX offering in which the winning listener has sex in a helicopter while flying  over the house of a former spouse.  Sounds like a great bit.  You know, you got to be honest, right?  Sounds like a great bit.  Anything that involves a helicopter.  I'm sure they did it in a hacky way.  Yeah.  What did they do?  Oh, my God.  Look at the helicopter. 
[02:08:00]  And then they got one of their stupid street guys in front of the house, probably with  a microphone, trying to get in touch with the ex.  Sex for Sam.  Uh-oh.  What one was that?  Like this was happening all over the place.  Yeah.  I think we were the only idiots doing this one.  Right.  You got to give us that.  We were the only morons doing one of these.  We stood alone once again.  Yep.  We stand alone a lot.  In this yearly contest named after Sam Adams beer, couples competed to have sex in notable 
[02:08:30]  public places.  Choc-choc.  Soapy and Anthony were fired for an incident in which a couple allegedly had sex in St.  Patrick's Cathedral.  Say hello to tamer gimmicks such as gasoline giveaways.  There you go.  WTVN bought $10,000 worth of gas, then announced where the gas would be given away minutes before  the pumps open.  Wow.  These are stuff that are replacing the shocking.  Cutting edge. 
[02:09:00]  Radiothons.  The marathon fundraisers for charity have become a staple of local stations such as WSNY and  WWCD.  We've just all been castrated.  Dude, let's have a radiothon.  Not all.  Not all.  Let's have a radiothon.  I mean as an industry.  Oh yeah, the industry is screwed.  Let's have a radiothon, but do it for rapists.  That might be controversial.  I want to do it with...  Hey, Moe seems to be into it. 
[02:09:30]  I want to do the cow bingo thing.  You want to do cow bingo?  Yes, but I want to do it in our own style somehow.  Instead of numbers, you have our interns laying with their mouths open.  And we got a fat chick.  In a cow suit.  Hey, we could do it that way.  What?  Get a fat girl.  Fat girl with cow ears.  You make her wear like a cow...  Just a cow mask.  The little horns.  Yeah.  Call her Bessie.  How about we...  Wait, she's got to go.  How about we lay the contestants down.  We get a fat chick. 
[02:10:00]  Okay.  That may or may not make it to nine months.  Wow, that's a lot.  That could be a long contest.  But what a payoff.  Yeah.  But what a payoff.  Those episodes tend to be a bit spontaneous.  I don't think you could really plan that out.  We have a bunch of listeners with softballs.  Like a dunking booth. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  Radiothons.  And then finally...  Sink the dreams.  Instead of the shock stuff, call-in contests.  Right.  The traditional promotion, which prompts listeners to be the X number caller, is designed to keep  listeners glued to their radios.  By the way, that does not work.  Because most people do not call in to win prizes.  You dummies.  Yeah.  They think it works, but most people do not even attempt to win something on the radio. 
[02:11:00]  I'm sure you're a listener.  All right.  Bo, you got anything else?  No, let's go over where I could actually say.  F***.  Hey, man.  We had a lot of fun today.  You know, we really do appreciate you guys.  Have a great Whip'em Out Wednesday.  Yes.  If you're not going to join us over at XM, we'll see you tomorrow, okay?  Thursday.  We'll see you Thursday.  Thank you.  Bye. 
[02:11:30]  I came up with something years ago.  Basically, it says...  Whip'em Out Wednesday.  Big, luscious, juicy ones.  Right?  Wow.  The swinging tribute to unrestrained female enemies.  Wow.  It's Whip'em Out Wednesday.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  The O.B. and Anthony XM walkover begins now. 
[02:12:00]  Smoking.  Make sure you get footage of him smoking on the job.  Make sure you get footage.  They're not that tough, buddy.  Smoking.  Stop acting like you're a tough guy.  You're not.  He's a fat midget.  And he's smoky on the job.  And I don't like him.  What?  Set up some scaffolding.  What'd he say?  What?  What'd he say?  What'd he say, Simon?  What did he say?  He can't do nothing. 
[02:12:30]  What'd he say?  I said you can't do nothing with this.  What'd he say?  What?  You can't do nothing with this.  You can't do nothing with this.  You can't do nothing with this.  Oh, meaning like with the...  I don't get it.  With what?  Sir, I don't get it.  What did you mean?  Look, he's...  Oh, God.  I hate...  You can't do nothing with this.  Oh.  What?  Did he mean like with this?  Like, hey, look at this.  He's just an asshole.  There's three Asian...  Like his body?  There's three Asian people just hanging out.  They're just trying to figure out where they're going to go in New York City. 
[02:13:00]  Minding their own business.  Nothing's going on.  And look...  Leaning against the building.  Look, he's over there telling them they have to move on.  And they don't understand English.  They have no clue because they don't even speak English.  This guy is the biggest douchebag.  He's probably had a tough upbringing, I gotta tell you.  He is one of the most despicable people.  Yeah.  He's short and round and people hate him.  Yeah.  And it's been that way since birth.  He looks like the last half of Raging Bull. 
[02:13:30]  All right.  Let's go.  He's a short, fat man.  Let's go.  We're all in a good mood today.  We should keep it that way.  And the mic's work and everything.  Yeah.  Let's go.  We have a busy show.  A busy second half of the show today.  Hey, it's the Indian Santa.  We...  What do we got?  Oh, we got the Minnesota Timberwolves player.  He got caught jerking off in his car.  Jerking off.  We got, uh...  What do you use this for?  Jerking off? 
[02:14:00]  What was he looking at his pay stub?  What else?  There was a whole bunch of things that we couldn't do over there.  Something about David Guest dipping his cock in chocolate.  Ooh.  Is that what he did?  He likes doing that.  I didn't hear that.  We're going to try to listen to some of those Columbus radio stations.  Oh, look at this.  Those Columbus morning shows.  Get ready to...  Hey, where are you from?  Where are you from?  Hi.  Where?  Montreal.  Montreal.  Die.  Hey, Canada.  They're on one of those double-decker buses that are all the rage for the sightseers in 
[02:14:30]  New York, and the only way I want to see it is driving under a bridge that's much too  low for it.  We want to listen to the Columbus morning shows.  Get that set up before we get to XF.  Yep.  Some of you callers out there can help us out with that.  What else?  There's a couple other really good stories that we couldn't do over at Free FM today.  We're all going to fuck Jimmy.  Are we going to have footage of that fat security guard up today?  I hope so.  I want footage of him up on our website. 
[02:15:00]  So people can see what an ass he really is.  Every day, we should film him.  There's nothing wrong with filming a guy who's busting your balls.  No.  Meh.  Meh.  He stands out there smoking when he's supposed to be doing his duties.  His duties entail hassling people.  He's just hassling people.  He's a fucking...  He's a guy who never got pussy.  Hey, Moe!  Why did that guy just look at my cock?  Oh, where is it?  This guy just looked at my cock. 
[02:15:30]  Hey, look what's crossing the street.  Can we get a walk across?  Oh, Jimmy's signing the autograph.  Jimmy's signing the autograph.  Oh, you dropped something.  Dropped something.  I'm not picking that up.  Miss.  Go ahead.  Bend over.  Lock it up.  Now clean it up.  All right.  Hubba hubba.  Now clean it up.  All right.  Let's try to cross.  Oh, it's turning red.  All right.  Well, it doesn't matter.  It's going to go big.  Do-do-do-do.  Do-do-do-do. 
[02:16:00]  We're going to rework.  There goes another one.  You know, the listeners can help us out with this other bit we want to start doing.  We want to rework some of those classic radio promotions that these other shows used to do.  Howdy, Mac.  And then do the Opie and Anthony spin on them.  A little spin on the classic hack promotions.  Right.  Maybe...  Like the cow pie bingo, things like that.  You know what?  We asked Wackbag for help today.  Ooh.  Start a thread up on that message board. 
[02:16:30]  The hacky radio promotions we've all heard over the years on radio.  Are you listening to this program?  Of course she isn't.  When's the baby due?  Uh-oh.  Oh, yeah.  Are you not pregnant?  Oh, gee.  I can't even know when that happens.  Oh, I better leave.  Oh, my God, dude.  Might want to have a salad today.  I am actually embarrassed.  I knew she couldn't have been pregnant.  Oh, dude.  That was really awful.  Oh, okay.  That was bad.  Poor fat whore.  That's a good one today. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, shit.  The poor little fat girl.  What did the baby do?  She should wear a dress that's clingy like that.  She really had a gut on her.  Did you see that?  Yeah, she was awful.  Like everything else was fine.  Would you like her schlitz?  She had perfect breasts, perfect legs, but a big pot belly.  No one?  Pop fiction?  No.  Fuck you as all.  Oh.  I guess that's the end of the work.  Where's Opie?  He already went inside.  All right.  We'll just stand out here. 
[02:17:30]  All right.  Let's follow this guy with a fat, round head.  Where?  Oh, they went in?  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Look at us now.  The four of you that showed up.  God bless.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Oh.  Are we going back outside?  Nah.  No, I thought after Anthony's line, you know, we did our job.  I mean, we're not going to beat that, so we might as well end.  I knew someone was going to blurt that out.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Oh, there.  Mike's cracking up, so now it's time to wait until we get upstairs.  Opie and Anthony, XM202. 
[02:18:00]  A couple was in a vestibule at St. Pat's doing ass sex.  Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick.  Sounds great.  Complete whores.  Opie and Anthony got this couple to have sex in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Decoration against the church is disrespectful.  It's a true sacrilege.  It was just a joke.  Opie's fault again.  How can we blow up our lives today?  You rocking sex.  Go away!  Go away!  Go away!  Uh-oh. 
[02:18:30]  We're in it again.  They hire people who are artists to do a certain thing, and then when they go too far, they  suddenly wash the hands of them if they feel the heat is too heavy.  Opie and Anthony should not have been fired.  Technically, we didn't get fired.  They probably shouldn't have hired them in the first place.  Exiled radio hosts.  They had been fired in Boston after announcing that the mayor was killed.  Another prank.  And I go, Anthony, I got a great idea today.  We're going to tell the whole city of Boston that the mayor died in a fiery car crash while  he was on vacation in Florida.  What do you think?  Oh, my God.  Is this a bad one?  Oh! 
[02:19:00]  It just gets worse and worse.  Everything just went right down the crapper.  Can I just say fuck?  Yes!  The duo has signed on with XM Satellite Radio.  Thank God.  Yeah, we'll make it work.  Oh, what a glorious day.  It's all about me.  I play golf with old guys.  I am a grinning idiot.  Act, act, act.  Hang on, it's Opie and Anthony.  We're back now.  The new club of the radio.  Ho, ho, Opie.  Shut up! 
[02:19:30]  Thank you.  You don't go to CNN for dick jokes.  Don't come to ONA for hard-hitting news.  I love Opie and Anthony.  My name is Opie and Anthony.  My name is Opie and Anthony.  Opie is a great and beautiful.  I don't know.  Your mom's box.  I love Opie and Anthony.  We stink.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, we're here.  Setting up.  Getting everything ready.  I'm here anyway.  That's why everybody else went.  To the bathroom.  Jimmy's usually despicable on the elevator,  but there was a fan of a tough crowd on there,  so he was all nice. 
[02:20:30]  When it's in his interest,  he doesn't fart like an animal.  Ah, there's Pal Tuck.  Hi.  Back up.  And now, sound.  We're all here.  Is this like a joke?  Everyone figured they'd just leave me alone?  Is that what they're doing?  That's a good gag.  All right. 
[02:21:00]  Well, we were going to go through the rest of the hacky radio bits,  so I hope he came up with a good idea.  We want to do these,  but put our own little spin on them.  Put our own little angle on them.  That's great.  That's the joke that everyone's playing on Anthony today, right?  It's obvious.  Absolutely, man.  It's just like,  just leave me hanging. 
[02:21:30]  What happened?  Just leave me hanging.  Dude, I had to take a leak.  Angel.  And blow my little nose.  Oh.  And we're discussing that fucking  ball-breaking fat security.  Here's why I don't like it.  I hate him, actually.  Jimmy and I are obsessed with this guy.  Because you know what he is.  A guy doing his job is one thing.  A guy who comes over and goes,  look, guys, you've got to move it along  just because I'm going to get him.  You can't clock.  It's one thing.  But he's a fucking ball-breaker  who loves the idea of telling people what to do,  which is why he's in that fucking worthless job. 
[02:22:00]  He's playing the part.  He's a cunt.  So I would like,  and I told Sam to film him  because he's smoking.  You're not supposed to be smoking  while you're working,  as far as I'm concerned.  And if you're on break,  then go fuck yourself.  Don't tell anybody what to do.  Right.  So I want him filmed every fucking day.  If you're going to bust our balls,  we'll film you.  And also,  maybe the listeners,  the next time they're there,  could take photos of him.  And eventually,  if he keeps breaking balls,  maybe when the listeners show up,  you have signs with his photo on it.  Oh, he'd enjoy that.  Yeah, I'm sure he would.  You want to fucking break balls, douchebag?  You want to break balls? 
[02:22:30]  Jimmy, as much as I'm with you today,  I want to stay happy  and it has nothing to do with you.  Trust me.  Okay.  I had nothing to do with you  because I completely agree with you.  But I'm looking at Hurricane New York  and we're going to go right back  to being really happy.  Okay.  You know the cow bingo thing  we were just discussing?  Yeah.  On the other side of the show.  And I guess you heard us on the walkover.  We really want a list  of all those hacky radio bits  that have been done  a million times by morning shows  and they all claim  they're the only show doing it.  And we want to take some of these 
[02:23:00]  and put our own spin on it.  The Opie and Anthony spin.  Make it not hacky  and make it fun.  And there we are  with the cow bingo thing.  How can we make it  into an Opie and Anthony thing, right?  Listen to this.  Eric from New York.  Go ahead, Eric.  You know, even though I hate him,  how about a promotion  with no filter Paul bingo?  Now he...  Where he gets to eat that crap  that he got from a Boston guy  and just let it loose.  He's never been one to shy away 
[02:23:30]  from crapping on the air.  This is the question I have.  Yeah.  Can we get XM  to get a surprise for this?  No, we do.  And we'll give away numbers.  Now, you know,  we can't have Paul  walking around this thing.  Not outside.  Unless he's blindfolded  so he's not looking  at the numbers.  I'm just thinking  to keep it random.  Or get a big, like, wheel.  And he's above the wheel somehow  and, you know,  when he lets loose,  then we stop the wheel  and we figure out  which number got destroyed. 
[02:24:00]  That sounds a little high-tech.  Well, dude, no, no.  You just turn the numbers  upside down.  We can't do that  because it'll splatter like...  Oh, my God.  No, you turn the numbers  upside down.  So after he shits,  you just turn the number  back over.  Oh.  You don't face the numbers up  so he can't see them.  Sort of takes away  from the excitement, though.  No, he shits on a thing.  Like, what's the...  Oh, I see.  I still like the pinwheel thing.  It can turn into pinwheel art.  Oh.  You blindfold him.  I said blindfold him.  Yeah, blindfold him.  We make sure he walks  around the whole area.  Well...  Maybe you can get rid  of those cubicles 
[02:24:30]  that you have in the office  and lay up some numbers  over there.  I'll be honest.  If Paul does this,  I will almost like him again.  Wow.  Almost.  What'll he wear?  A jock.  Punch it out.  A jock?  A jock strap.  No, he wore the diaper  or the...  What did he wear last time?  Yeah, but the diaper  isn't gonna...  Which would prevent him  from shitting.  You can't have a diaper.  Dude, it went flying  out his leg.  Go to the videotape.  He's wearing a diaper  with the back cut out.  Yeah, exactly.  What is his little  fucking hiney hole?  Well, we'll wait  for Paul to call.  Blimey asshole.  We'll see if he's in. 
[02:25:00]  Then we'll get the listeners.  Where are we gonna do  this horrific thing?  I say Hawk's apartment.  This is why you have  XM, by the way.  It's gotta be...  For a British man  shitting on numbers.  Right.  It can't be out in public.  We know that much.  Right.  So we need a place inside.  We could do it  right out here.  Oh, my God.  These cubicles aren't...  They gotta go.  The cubicles have to go there.  Get rid of the cubicles.  We could, like...  Fuck.  We could get plastic  that covers up 
[02:25:30]  the entire cubicle.  The walls and the floor.  And then it'll make  a little stall for him.  But there's no room in here.  There's no room  to do something like that here.  We'll figure it out.  Like, the numbers  on the floor  in between the walk  from the studio  to the office.  Right.  And he walks  back and forth.  Who's working  for the show today?  I know Thanh's working  for the show today.  He's gotta be blindfolded.  I know...  Where's Danny?  I know E-Rock's  working for the show today.  Travis certainly  is working for the show today.  Congratulations to the boys,  by the way.  They're gonna be  full-time employees, finally.  Travis... 
[02:26:00]  Aren't you?  Travis is worth  his weight in gold.  They should have been,  but X-Men finally  got the paperwork done  and these guys are  officially full-time employees.  No one heard it.  Even though they're  working 60 hours a week.  But no one heard it.  What'd you say, buddy?  No, I'm not gonna say it.  No, I actually didn't hear it.  A little jab at Travis joke.  Go ahead, jab at him.  I liked it.  I said, Travis is worth  his weight in gold.  Eight cents.  I heard eight cents.  I didn't hear what it was.  Fuck it.  That's right, charm bracelet weight.  You heard what the boss said. 
[02:26:30]  All right.  We need to know  if X-Men is in on this contest.  We'll do it either way.  We'll do it for free.  Yeah.  We'll do it for bragging rights.  We don't care.  Just for fun.  We'll do it for bragging rights.  Because we can.  But we'll chip in  and give away personal things.  I have a lamp I'm trying to sell.  Oh, there you go.  You can have my lamp.  Are you really trying  to sell a lamp?  Why not?  Cheapo.  I'll give away a lamp.  Yeah.  Whatever listener blows me.  We could have put together  an Opie Anthony and Jim  prize bag  from our personal collection.  Yeah.  Let's see. 
[02:27:00]  Hmm.  I have nothing.  Yeah, you do.  I'll come up with some dumb stuff.  Give away some of your clothes,  your shoes.  All right.  Give away clothes?  These are fancy digs.  Look, now we put a time limit  on things.  XM, I need to know immediately.  Oh, boy.  Or someone in that other office,  call them immediately,  explain the contest.  We want to do the contest,  and we want a good prize.  XM, and immediately.  That's two words.  I know.  And then, no filter to Paul,  you need to call to tell us  if you're in or out  as far as being the guy 
[02:27:30]  that's going to, you know,  dump the load on a number.  Paul's going into a job interview.  He's calling us back.  Oh, good.  All right.  So we'll find out about that.  Tell the people at the job interview  what you're going to be doing.  Let's say hi to Joe in California.  Joe.  Hey, guys.  Yeah, I just heard on Fox News today,  I guess Mancow was fired  from a Chicago station.  Yeah.  Yep.  He was real vague on what happened, 
[02:28:00]  and I just want to...  Vague.  I'd be vague, too.  Well, the vagueness is that  his ratings are nowhere near  where they used to be,  and the station has decided  to move on  because it costs way too much money  to continue having him do  the morning show  for that radio station.  He's being replaced by an iPod,  pretty much.  He will spin it another way,  but that is the facts.  Yeah, I think he was blaming it  on him being Christian  and hanging around with Fox News. 
[02:28:30]  He seemed to think  that was the reason.  The general manager is saying  the show,  it's just not what it used to be.  Or maybe another...  I felt a little bad.  I think he wanted to stick around,  but it's the best thing to do,  knowing his audience.  Best for both of us.  So they're moving on.  Moving on.  So...  All right, hold on.  I don't even want to talk  to someone else.  Do it.  Paul. 
[02:29:00]  Hey.  Sorry, I didn't hear  what you guys were talking about.  I'm actually at a job interview  right now.  All right, job interview.  Here's what we need.  We're going to play a game of...  It's usually called cow bingo.  But you know how that works?  A cow walks around  and when he shits on a number,  the person that has  the corresponding number  wins a prize.  Uh-oh.  It's going to be a bad twist.  We want to do this,  but we want to use you...  Would you wear a number  on your chest?  I'm just kidding.  It depends what happens next.  We want to use you, actually,  to walk around in a diaper 
[02:29:30]  with the back cut out  and have some of that stuff  that you drank  that time you were on the show  that made you shit  and then walk around  blindfolded around these numbers  and when you shit on a number,  somebody who has  the corresponding number  will win a prize.  Hopefully a good prize.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I just talked to him.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  You could have just made  a general statement.  All right, good.  So what do you think?  That was for you, audience.  You in?  Yeah, probably, yeah.  All right.  He's in.  Paul's a good boy.  Why wouldn't you talk to him?  He's a fucking trooper. 
[02:30:00]  How's the job interview?  It's going good.  What kind of job?  Hopefully no one listens.  What kind of job?  Computer work.  Now working.  Okay.  All right.  All right, guys.  We'll let you know, sweetie.  Thank you.  Absolutely.  Have a good day.  Bye, Paul.  This is computer magic.  He's in.  The listeners are in, obviously.  Now we're just waiting on XM.  Cool.  Waiting on XM.  Maybe this is a crazy...  Blueberries!  These are perfect blueberries.  They're blueberries.  I'm so happy Dan DeVito is calling in. 
[02:30:30]  At 10 o'clock.  Fucking rules.  Big star.  Oh, he's great, dude.  Director, producer.  Actor.  One of the funniest men ever in television.  Yes.  What a character.  Holy crap.  That movie diploma.  Hold on a second.  Can we do this?  Now we've got to get Pete involved.  Uh, sperm holder.  Hey, what's going on?  I already know where you're going.  No.  Why?  It's public.  I got an idea.  What if you have a diaper on?  Hello?  Go ahead, sperm holder. 
[02:31:00]  All right, check it out.  Do it at the traveling virus event.  You'll have plenty of people here.  That's your venue.  Nobody can tell you what to do.  Have, you know, just have him, like you're saying, put the numbers down and run around,  do laps around, and whenever he shits, whatever number he shits on, boom, there you go.  Yeah, let's run a pie, Pete, just for the hell of it.  Maybe we don't want to do it at our classy event.  But, uh, let's at least ask Pete.  Our classy event.  Tickets available through Ticketmaster.com and OpieandAthony.com.  We'll give you all the info on the ONA Traveling Virus Tour, featuring the comedians you know 
[02:31:30]  and love from this show.  All right.  Why don't we take a break, regroup, uh, we got lots of stuff to do.  Lots of stuff.  Yes, we do.  A lot of stuff we couldn't do over there, um, on FM radio.  I'm really surprised.  Dirty.  Dirty stuff.  Two dumps today, by the way.  We could do this real fast.  Two dumps, that's it.  Without the thing.  We are getting really good at that broadcast radio.  When, uh, a caller said, fuck, and at 6.48, Billy Idol had some girl doing an orgasm  for him.  A caller.  Came and said orgasm. 
[02:32:00]  Why can't you say that?  You can't say, orgasm's one of those words.  They don't want you to use them, like masturbation.  FCC says it's fine, but the second you use it.  FCC says it's fine?  Masturbation, yeah.  But the second you use it, uh, you're probably using it in a context that isn't fine.  So they try to trick you.  Yeah, you could use the word masturbation.  Okay.  So, um, I was masturbating.  Ah, now that's fine, because you said you were masturbating.  Right.  That describes too graphically the thing.  So I could just blurt the word out.  Right.  See, you could probably just say, orgasm. 
[02:32:30]  Right.  Just say, orgasm.  But you can't say, Billy Idol had some girl doing an orgasm for him.  That's how it works.  All right, let's see how to...  I'd like to fill you in on the rules here.  Uh, let's say how to Dominic in Jersey.  Dominic.  Boys, what's happening?  What's up?  Hey, here's the thing.  When you get no filter, Paul, and you get him in the diaper, but you gotta dress him up  like a cow.  Maybe get them plastic udder things for Halloween.  Hang him off his stomach.  Put a cowbell around his neck and have people with drumsticks.  Just give him a good whack on the cowbell.  That awful cow costume that people show up at every costume party in? 
[02:33:00]  Yes.  All right.  All right, Paul, it's getting worse for you, buddy.  He's going to have to wear a cow costume.  A cow costume.  And there's going to have to be some element where the listeners that have something at  stake, they got the numbers.  Uh-huh.  You know, Paul might not move around good enough.  So the listeners have to be able to somehow...  To motivate him with a cattle prod.  No?  Somehow taunt him and be able to throw something at him that makes him move him around a lot.  Whatever that is.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute. 
[02:33:30]  Can there be some kind of an interest for Paul, too?  Like...  I'm starting to think we just collect money from the listeners and ourselves, and maybe  we give Paul, like, a cut of the action for being a good...  Wait, no, no.  If Paul shits...  And then he'll have money to tip when he goes to FH Riley.  How about if he shits on one number, the listeners win.  But if he shits on another number, he wins.  Something.  Like, you understand what I mean?  Like...  Like, give him a number.  Give him a piece of it. 
[02:34:00]  Um...  There's got to be a way to do that.  I got it.  What?  I think.  There's, uh...  He gets a certain amount of money the longer he lasts.  Okay.  It's kind of like that...  We'll have, I don't know, like a...  Like, a running clock, and it's his money total, and it's just going...  Right.  Up.  It would be going up.  Let's say going up.  So we just have a clock, and, you know...  Going up.  So every minute he gets another...  So he'll try to hold it as much as possible.  But when you're...  A quarter.  When you're drinking this stuff, it gets really painful. 
[02:34:30]  He gets a dollar for every hour and a half.  I don't mean it.  All right.  We're doing this no matter what.  Yeah.  What is XM going to say?  Even if it's just cash.  But maybe there's a crazy sponsor out there that really wants a lot of mentions.  Yeah, Charmin.  I want...  I want answers by tomorrow.  I have to call Elo on the break.  Why?  We have a little issue to discuss.  Uh-oh.  That could be trouble.  Losing Jimmy. 
[02:35:00]  That?  Uh-huh.  We're losing you?  Yes.  No.  That thing?  Yes.  Or this thing?  Going to lob it at him?  He said yes to everything.  Both.  Both?  Yeah.  How is this thing going to affect us personally, Oppie?  This?  You'll miss me.  These guys.  What are you talking about?  What are they?  Full-timers?  Yeah.  To people.  It's going to affect our purse strings? 
[02:35:30]  No.  What?  You have these interns in your pockets, like so many nickels and dimes.  You must let us.  XM is...  Drink drool from the well.  XM is picking up the tab.  Wet our beaks.  On the big raises for the boys.  That's good.  Even though they want even bigger raises, I understand.  But it's a...  It's a step in the right direction.  Because they get some of that...  Some of that benefits.  That's the biggest part.  They get some benefits.  That's good.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We really do have a lot to do today over here.  So stay right there.  Whip-A-Mount Wednesday is a wonderful pastime embraced by Opie and Anthony fans all over the globe. 
[02:36:00]  Some people, however, fail to see the joy in this time-honored tradition.  In the spirit of fairness, we offer them this platform to voice their opinions to the Opie and Anthony show.  Introducing Irate Keyboarding Person.  Dear Opie and Anthony, why do you guys always have to talk about Whip-A-Mount Wednesday?  I don't want to see strange boobies.  The only boobies I want to see are the ones on my lovely bride, Eunice. 
[02:36:30]  Or the ones on my back.  I really need to see a doctor, I think there's this.  If the thought of seeing naked breasts upsets you this much, we submit to you that there may be a larger issue you're not dealing with.  For more information on Whip-A-Mount Wednesday, or to get a WOW sticker, visit opieandanthony.com.  All right, we're working on this contest. 
[02:37:00]  Tony from D.C. has a great idea for the No Filter Paul contest.  Tony, go ahead.  All right, guys, if you really want to put the Opie and Anthony spin on it, what you've got to do is have the contestants follow him around with little cups, and they've got to catch the stuff when it comes out of there, and whoever catches the most will be the winner. 
[02:37:30]  All right, that is fucking disgusting.  And hilarious at the same time.  So you've got the listeners around the perimeter with their little paper cups.  They're waiting for No Filter Paul.  Just waiting.  Paul's drinking.  What is that stuff called again?  It's make you shit juice.  Yeah, there you go.  And they're waiting, and they're waiting.  And instead of numbers, they're just around the perimeter.  As soon as they know he's letting loose, they all die forward.  They rush with their cups and try to get it under his asshole. 
[02:38:00]  And whoever gets the most shit in their cup wins.  Because, you know, they'd be knocking each other's cups out of the way, and it would be hitting their hands and arms.  You can make them scrape it off the ground, too.  They would have to be in some type of biohazard suits.  That is hilarious.  Big gloves and bio suits.  And then someone else is saying, have people guess how long Paul's going to last.  We could have all sorts of betting.  We could get Bowdog involved.  Side bets.  This thing has potential.  Oh, yeah.  Side betting. 
[02:38:30]  All right, let's say hi to Mud Jacket.  By the way, we're dead serious about this.  We want to do this.  We will do it in some form.  And we'll do it.  I want to do it next week.  I don't want to wait around.  Mud Jacket, what's up?  Yeah, I got a perfect name for this contest there, guy.  It's called Man Cow Bingo.  Man Cow Bingo.  Yes.  No Phil DePaul looks like a retarded version of Man Cow.  Everyone says that, yeah, that he looks like a Man Cow.  He looks like a... 
[02:39:00]  Like if you stuck an air hose up Man Cow's ass and blew him up a little bit.  They got the same Lego hair, though.  All right, we'll call it Man Cow Bingo.  That's not a bad idea.  All right, we got that one done already.  That's a little homage to the newly, dearly departed.  Well, he was just on Fox and Friends.  Was he?  Man Cow's another radio guy that's just a liar.  This guy's really a phony. 
[02:39:30]  A spin doctor.  Oh, is he a phony?  He got fired.  He got fired from his hometown station.  That's not good.  Went out in a fizzle.  He's going to probably spin it somehow, but the reality is they wanted to move on.  They weren't impressed.  His ratings weren't...  Who the fuck farted?  Holy shit, Jimmy.  No, it might be...  No, it's the egg whites.  No, if I farted, I'd tell you.  It's the egg whites.  Does the egg whites stink?  What is it about the yolk that makes the egg not as nasty smelling than just fucking egg whites? 
[02:40:00]  I don't know.  And egg whites are disgusting.  No, they're healthy.  They're really good for you.  Rubbery shit.  I'm eating them because it's healthy, Anthony.  All right, so he's lost his hometown station.  That is...  I don't care what he says.  That is bad.  And the GM has come out and said that the ratings weren't what they used to be.  Nope.  Weren't what they wanted.  And I'm sure he was still doing pretty well in Chicago.  I don't think he was in there for years.  I don't think he was at the top of the leaderboard in a lot of the demos. 
[02:40:30]  But he was still doing okay.  Problem is, he wants a certain amount of money.  So then, you know, as a general manager, you have to sit there and go, well, he wants this  much for these ratings that are coming in.  Yeah.  They weigh it.  And they said, no, goodbye.  We could do better without you at this point.  Yep.  And that's what they're going to do.  So we got them from Fox and Friends.  I swear we haven't heard this yet.  It just came across.  Now, where was he broadcasting from?  Because I know he did it from the studio.  Did they? 
[02:41:00]  Q-101 or something like that up there?  No, I know, I know, that's what it was, and that's where he used to broadcast from when  he did his Fox little things.  So where was he doing it this morning?  Oh, I see.  They threw him out.  No, I know he's out.  So, anyone know?  I don't know.  They probably did it from his living room or something.  Or maybe got some kind of studio in Chicago.  Yeah.  Everyone's talking about him today, but it's not good.  No, when you go out in a fizzle like that, it's not, you know, you got to hit the wall 
[02:41:30]  with all your fuel tanks full and explode.  That way, you have something to come back with, you know?  Fox TV.  He was in New York and Chicago.  When you just kind of, ah, you're done here.  Thank you.  Good night.  We don't need you anymore.  And you're gone.  And they told him he would have until Friday.  So he was probably gearing up, thinking he'd be able to say goodbye to his fans or bitch  out to the station.  You know, hey, they left Howard in there.  You know, they'll leave me in there.  They left Diamond David Lee Roth. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, they left him.  Let him say goodbye.  I think what they're going to do is let me say goodbye to my fans, because that's what  I want to do.  And I was like, shut up.  Nope.  And at the end of the show yesterday, they just said, all right, your service is no longer  needed here.  Bye-bye.  And don't touch your computer.  And it wasn't even nice.  We will be checking for child porn, so we have something against you.  We'll check everything.  Oh, they're the worst when they hate you.  All right, here we go.  Here's Man Cow.  It was on TV a few minutes ago, I guess. 
[02:42:30]  If you are watching in Chicago today, and you turn on the radio, Man Cow is on the radio,  but it's an old show.  It's one of those so-called best of Man Cows, because Man Cow is currently not on the air  live in Chicago because of some stuff that's going on.  Change is Man Cow joins us now live from Chicago.  Good morning.  Hey, guys.  We call them worst of shows.  My radio station is...  We call them worst of shows.  We call them worst of shows. 
[02:43:00]  You said best of.  He's got to get into his Man Cow character.  So I was watching some show last night.  It was a video clip on one of the sites, and it was this cooking show or fucking restaurant  show, and it was Man Cow taking this reporter around to an Italian restaurant in Chicago that  he just loves.  And he goes, yeah, well, these people are used to seeing Eric come in here, not the Man Cow  character.  He goes, because that's character.  When the show's not on, there is no Man Cow. 
[02:43:30]  It's like, wow, that's a ballsy move to admit to your audience that you're a complete  phony, that everything that comes out of your mouth is a fake, scripted piece of shit.  At least I'm smart enough to admit that I'm an actor.  When you come out of character, you let the people know.  That I'm just an actor.  Yes.  Playing the part of Opie on the Opie and Anthony show.  Because you...  That would be Greg Hughes, the actor that plays Opie on the Opie and Anthony show.  Who, by the way, is nothing like the Opie character on the show, except for the fact 
[02:44:00]  that he is exactly like the Opie character.  I wish...  Come on, it makes me sleep well at night.  Give me a little something here.  I wish I could separate the me here from the me not here.  Wouldn't that be nice?  No.  All right, here we go.  I apologize for interrupting.  Lucid douchebag.  What happened?  In Lebanon, they just kidnapped Israeli soldiers, and Israel has said it's an act of war.  Oh, there you go.  All right, another war in the Middle East.  These fucking Middle Eastern countries, why would you kidnap Israeli soldiers? 
[02:44:30]  They're just going...  I hope they wipe...  The reason they're fighting in the first place is because they kidnapped one Israeli soldier.  So Israel sent in the troops, and now their reaction...  That's Hezbollah, but it's Lebanon.  ...was to kidnap some Israeli soldiers.  Well, Hezbollah's in charge of the Palestinians.  I don't know.  Yeah, weren't they elected?  Who was?  Hamas.  Oh, Hamas.  I always get Hezbollah and Hamas confused.  Yeah.  I'll accept that mistake, by the way. 
[02:45:00]  Let it be written, so let it be done.  That's awful.  Wait, you were wrong?  I was wrong on that one.  Well, yeah, they have H's.  You got the name thing wrong.  It's an H, and they're savages.  That's confusing.  All right, getting back to the man-cow thing.  Ah, man-cow.  We'll get some updates on this little problem that's...  Jesus, that's out of control.  We call it Worst Of.  I know it's a major problem.  Now, let me hear the spin of this past.  I know that much.  All right, here we go.  Hey, guys.  We call them Worst Of shows.  My radio station is right over that way behind me, but now I'm sitting here in the city talking 
[02:45:30]  to you guys.  What happened?  What's next?  I mean, did it end badly for you?  You know, it didn't end badly.  I fell off the turnip truck into Chicago 12 years ago.  I've done very successful radio.  We have the highest-rated show in the morning.  The show is exploding nationwide.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  How does he sleep?  He is so full of shit, and Steve Dahl did such a good job with this.  The turnip truck.  Yesterday, he got all the press releases that were put out by man-cow's people, how he 
[02:46:00]  is a ratings juggernaut.  Juggernaut.  Yeah.  Ugh.  And he talks about how he's highly rated in the top ten markets, and Steve Dahl just ripped  them apart.  He pointed out every market he's in and figured the only market he was in that is even in the  top ten was L.A., and he's on a little AM in L.A.  That's it.  He's in no other top ten market. 
[02:46:30]  Guy's completely full of shit.  Exploding around the country.  Who's going to pay your syndication bills?  That costs a little bit of money to syndicate.  And if you're syndicating to a bunch of shitty little markets, which he is, you need that  flagship backbone big company to help defer some of the costs.  Wait.  Where do you broadcast from?  So he's not booted from all those stations, just the one in Chicago.  No, but he's going to need now a place to broadcast from, which he's got to pay for. 
[02:47:00]  Or he's going to have to run out of space.  If he's continuing doing this without a company behind him, he's then going to have to pay  for what they call bird time to get your show out there to the affiliates.  And if you're being paid a shit amount of money for these little markets, and a lot of  these little markets, they don't pay a lot of money.  They're barely worth doing.  It's good for exposure or to get out there, but barely worth doing.  You can't survive on just those.  You need the main gig.  That was his money gig. 
[02:47:30]  Sure.  You know?  We got our money gig.  We got our money gig here.  We got our money gig over at CBS.  It's nice to have two money gigs.  You have money gigs.  But if we get a few markets that are coming in, we want to be in Providence.  We want to be in a few other markets in the Northeast.  Lebanon.  Lebanon would be a great market.  If we want to be in some of those, those wouldn't be self-supporting markets.  It would be nice to be in them, but they're not huge money markets. 
[02:48:00]  You need the big company behind you.  It would be enough money for Travis to live nice.  Maybe.  Maybe get his fucking belt to open up a little bit.  What wouldn't be?  A little waif.  Travis needs $3 worth of food a day.  He's a talking pretzel rod.  Anyway.  He's Gumby with less body fat.  Nothing?  Who would use the word juggernaut anyway, ever?  I'm the juggernaut, bitch.  Oh, perhaps Iraq would. 
[02:48:30]  Of course he would.  I'm the juggernaut, bitch.  Why didn't you say be ass?  Juggernaut must mean asshole.  Yes.  Because that makes the word cooler.  But it was like a child said it.  Because it did.  I'm the juggernaut, bitch.  Bitch.  Doesn't that sound like a kid?  Yeah, Voss when he's six.  I'm the juggernaut, bitch.  Bitch.  Ugh.  Bitch.  All right, where are we?  Let's get back to our man cow with his man cow voice.  So he said that he's number one. 
[02:49:00]  What he's basically saying there, he's probably technically not lying.  He's number one in probably a demo.  Probably like 1834 men.  Right.  One key demo.  But to stretch that out, what did he exactly say?  The turnip truck into Chicago 12 years ago.  I've done very successful radio.  We have the highest rated show in the morning.  We have the highest rated show in the morning.  Depends on the definition.  Clear that up.  It probably means he has the highest rated show in the morning when it comes to men, 18 to 34, 
[02:49:30]  that didn't do well on their SATs.  Right.  Like, it's just one little demo.  One little piece.  It's not the beauty contest demo, which is 12 plus, they call that.  That's everybody.  Persons 25 to 54.  Yeah.  Men 18 to 49.  I'd like to see those numbers.  Yeah.  Men 18 to 34.  Men 18 plus.  That type of thing.  Things like that.  Then the number starts going down.  The show is exploding nationwide.  It's not exploding nationwide. 
[02:50:00]  Now we're going to stop it every five seconds.  If it's exploding, you mean blowing up.  A show is not exploding nationwide when you're adding really tiny,  radio markets across America.  Peoria.  Steve Dahl was joking about one of the stations he's on is 100 miles outside of Detroit.  So he's almost in Detroit.  Almost in Detroit.  Oh, you can't hear it in Detroit.  No.  But on your way to Detroit, if you're lucky, you'll be able to hear the show.  And he went through the whole thing.  He goes, well, he must be somewhere in Georgia because Atlanta's in Georgia.  And that's one of the top 10, isn't it? 
[02:50:30]  Texas has two of the top 10 in it.  He goes, let's see if he's even anywhere in Texas.  No, he's not.  The guy is a compulsive liar when it comes to his career and what he's done, what he's accomplished, where he is.  Just call that number and just let it ring.  And just let it – put it on hold and let it ring.  June Allison.  See, because she's dead and it would just ring. 
[02:51:00]  Right.  Maybe you think that's funny to poke fun at an older woman who's passed on, but I think it's in poor taste.  I'm sorry.  So, it's not exploding across America.  He got on an L.A. station, but it's an A.M.  You lie!  You're a fucking liar!  Shut up!  Wow.  Yeah, he's on a small A.M. station in L.A.  It's an A.M. sports station.  And he's on, yeah, from like 4.30 in the morning till 9 or something. 
[02:51:30]  Some weird time.  Right.  And really, what my management is quoted as saying in the paper is they didn't want me syndicated.  They didn't want it to be nationwide.  And I took a lot of grief every day for being with you guys.  Why?  You know what, guys?  After 9-11, I changed.  I was on TV with you guys.  Shut the fuck up!  Shut the fuck up, you cock-sucking asshole. 
[02:52:00]  Ugh!  After 9-11, I changed.  Did ya?  Ugh!  Listen to this horse shit.  Guys.  Why?  Um, you know what, guys?  After 9-11, I changed.  I was on TV with you guys on 9-11 when the planes hit.  Right.  My daughters have been born, and I'm trying to do a positive radio show.  Ah!  And our ratings have never been higher.  We've never made more money.  My show, just in Chicago, bills between $10 and $17 million. 
[02:52:30]  Wow.  And hours.  Uh, that's not that impressive, by the way.  No.  And it's, again, his press release was sent out with these figures.  This isn't, uh, the station saying this, or anybody.  You could, you could put out these press releases and say whatever you want.  Oh, just in Chicago, bills between $10 and $17 million.  Wow.  And, uh, that's a pretty line.  I don't know what they want.  Um, they wanted a show that would talk about their narrow alternative.  Yeah, what is it?  10 or $17?  Bill's between $10 and $17 million. 
[02:53:00]  That's, that's a, that's a pretty big jump.  That's huge.  That's huge.  Hey, who's that girl?  Who's that girl you fucked?  Well, she's between $10 and $17 million.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's, that's pretty, uh, wide.  And this is why, you know, and they're nice guys, and what's his name has been on our show.  I don't really like Fox and Friends.  They don't challenge anyone.  No.  Why aren't you challenging this guy?  Because there's somebody.  It doesn't make sense that the hometown station would drop you.  So obviously something's going on. 
[02:53:30]  There is, they hooked up.  Don't just take his word for it.  Pressure him a little bit.  They're not going to challenge him.  And I, I, I don't know what they want.  Um, they wanted a show that would talk about their narrow alternative music view, and I  really want to talk about big.  Yeah, all right.  So we got to stop it every five seconds, because that's what a radio station wants, to talk  about their narrow alternative music.  No.  No, the reality is, in commercial radio, they want the biggest audience possible.  Yeah.  That's the goal.  Commercial radio is big business. 
[02:54:00]  There was a time, uh, radio stations were filled with a bunch of guys that were just hippies,  what have you, that liked to smoke pot and play whatever the hell they wanted.  Mm-hmm.  And then, uh, the stupid suits got involved, uh, the salespeople got involved, and realized  we can make money at this.  Every second is money on radio.  So now it's not about that anymore.  It's about how much money you can possibly make.  No radio station would, would, uh, want to focus on a narrow alternative rock market.  No.  He knows that. 
[02:54:30]  And Fox and Friends, why don't they question them on this?  It's basic knowledge, if you know anything about radio.  I don't know what they want.  Um, they wanted a show that would talk about their narrow alternative music view, and I  really wanted to talk about big issues.  Anytime I would mention that I was a Christian, uh, they didn't like that.  Anytime I would talk politics.  Hey, no offense to you Christians out there, but, you know, man, Cal, you're done.  No one wants to hear about your-  That their favorite shock jock is now a Christian.  Christian, the day I become a Christian, trust me, would be the day that this show 
[02:55:00]  ends.  I would never go on.  Christian.  No one wants to hear that shit.  Because it's just going to be, all of a sudden, your viewpoint is going to change and be very  niche.  Does anyone know it?  Is he one of these born-again Christians?  I don't know.  I think he is.  I think I heard that.  Oh.  And it happened after he had his kids.  He fell asleep next to the bean pot.  He woke up, and the old man, Cal, was swept up and thrown into the back of the garbage  truck.  And you know what?  We've got born-again Christians listening to us. 
[02:55:30]  Nothing against you guys.  If it's working for you, great.  But as far as a popular radio show host going down this road and then expecting everyone  to still like him just as much-  Unless you're catering to that audience.  Right.  And it's going to be a small niche audience.  Thank you.  Yes.  Most times I've found born-again Christians do not have good senses of humor.  No one that closely associated with any religion is normally very funny or enjoys funny things.  They enjoy boring stories where they can pontificate. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  He thought he was going to be alive.  Oh, wow.  I remember him.  Yeah.  I know.  I was just throwing papers at the TV.  I remember you.  Keep wondering why we don't want you on the show.  It's a good song, though, by Skid Row, right?  I remember you.  Yeah.  Heard that in Pal Talk.  That one was very disappointing.  A lot of our old friends, you know, turned their back on us.  But that one was very disappointing, I've got to tell you.  All right.  Getting back to this.  And I really want to talk about big issues.  Anytime I would mention that I was a Christian, they didn't like that. 
[02:56:30]  Anytime I would talk politics, they didn't like that.  So, you know, look, Machiavelli said when you-  They didn't like how you were talking about the big issues.  I know, exactly.  They didn't like how you were talking about politics.  There was a one-time shock jock, relatively speaking, especially for his time, Don Imus.  The guy was the shock jock of the 70s.  He has now turned his show where he has political guests every day, yet he's surrounded by very funny people.  He keeps it light. 
[02:57:00]  He's a funny guy.  He understands what's funny.  That works.  So you can switch from being a shock jock to doing some irreverent political commentary.  Mankow thought that's what he would do, and it's easy.  He went from, hey, let's send Turd up here.  What he's going to do is he's going to drive and set off an airbag in a car.  We're going to have him hit a wall, and it's going to set off this airbag.  Uh-uh, Turd, Turd, are you with us, Turd?  Going from that to trying to-  Which, by the way, was a fake bit. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah.  It never happened.  Trying to verbally spar with people during his small segment on Fox News about politics and carry that over to his show, I guess.  Again, and this is no bullshit thing.  I have never heard his show.  I can't.  I don't know what it is.  But I know when you're unable to hang and talk politics, people are going to tune out.  It's boring unless you add a little twist, a little fun to it, a little something.  Imus was able to do that and change himself. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah.  You know, but he wasn't able to do it, and he continues to think that he could do it.  Sean Hannity's very talented when it comes to political talk radio.  The guy gets a good guest.  He sits there.  It's a compelling conversation.  Great to listen to.  It's not a comedy show.  Right.  It's not like that.  But if that's what you're into, Hannity's one of the guys to listen to.  And the left hates him.  Yeah, the left can't stand him.  Oh, they hate him.  So it's funny.  And he'll call out the right also when he feels, you know, they're tripping over their own dicks. 
[02:58:30]  But Mankow was incapable of making the change.  Just because he made the change, he thought he was being successful at it.  Just because you changed from, you know, the guy that held up traffic by getting a haircut on a bridge 20 fucking years ago or whatever the fuck it was,  you think you could then change to be some serious talk show host.  He didn't have it.  He wants to be Sean Hannity, and he doesn't have the chops for that.  Doesn't have it. 
[02:59:00]  So that's why your fucking station said they don't like when you talk politics.  It's not the politics you're talking.  It's the way you're fucking doing it.  You stink.  Phil in Michigan, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I'm a born-again Christian that listens to your show regularly every morning.  Very cool.  How was it coming out the second time, sir?  See, that's a vagina joke.  Not as wet.  See?  Okay, it's a little joke.  There you go.  See?  Here's the deal.  I hate when jerks like Man Cow use that for the reason they get fired. 
[02:59:30]  Nothing makes me more upset.  There you go.  There's only one thing business cares about.  Ratings go up.  You get more money, as you guys know.  He doesn't get...  Ratings go down.  Yeah.  You get fired.  They don't give a crap he's a Christian.  They give a crap that he can't talk about being a Christian in such a way that people  will find it interesting and tune in.  That's what they didn't like.  They don't give a shit he's talking about the issues of the day in politics.  They care that he couldn't talk about it in a way that people wanted to listen to it. 
[03:00:00]  Make it entertaining.  Make it compelling.  Make it so people want to hear it.  Thanks, man.  And then the boss isn't going to be mad.  Thanks, Phil.  Yep.  All right.  Thanks, man.  A lot of people say it.  God bless.  God bless.  He lost his edge.  Dave in Chicago.  What's up?  Hey, fellas.  There was just a newspaper article in the Tribune that came out not too long ago.  And it had all the rankings of the morning shows.  And Mancow's morning shows ranked like 15th behind most AM radio shows here in Chicago. 
[03:00:30]  And what?  12 plus?  Yeah.  Yeah.  There you go.  Yeah.  And of course, his deal was, you know, he would always yell on his show about how he was trying  to be a reverend or something like that before he became a shock jock.  Well, yeah.  The same kid as an angle.  Touch it out, boys.  Dude, people want to laugh.  Like, we sometimes get serious.  But you know it's not going to last more than one show or one segment of one show.  Show.  People, you know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  It's not going to be like an ongoing theme.  We're trying to force our beliefs down your throat.  There'll always be a scoop thrown in on it. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  During it.  Yeah.  You know what kind of hack he was?  He did wrestling.  Yeah.  We like talking about wrestling.  We know our listeners enjoy wrestling, so we try to, like, you know, understand what's  going on.  And when it was really big, we had guests that were wrestlers that came in, plug in where  they're going to be.  We were friends with the guys.  But we would never get in a wrestling ring and do a dumb, like, you know, radio show host  getting slapped around.  Hitting the head with a chair bid and...  Oh, my God.  I've been hitting the head with... 
[03:01:30]  Yeah.  I'm sure you have.  Let's continue.  I mean, it's only a three-minute clip.  We've done it in a minute.  The only wrestling I want to do is with a little oil and Travis on a slip and slide.  You try holding on.  A little eel.  Slip right through you.  Yeah.  A little eel.  Talk politics.  They didn't like that.  So, you know, look, Machiavelli said when you do good, equal evil rises against you.  So it's amazing.  As I've tried to do good, not everybody appreciates it. 
[03:02:00]  So your deal with...  Is it MS Broadcasting that you currently got a deal with?  So that's going to run out.  Yeah.  When?  Well, right now they're kind of fooling our listeners.  They're playing old tapes to me.  And the contract ends, I guess, it says in the paper, I think there's another month they're  going to pay me.  I'm continuing to do the show in Chicago and around America.  The show is live and we'll be back on in Chicago.  And the way Rush saved AM radio, I'm going to save FM radio. 
[03:02:30]  Well, wait a second.  You're continuing to do the show?  Oh, my God.  That job's taken.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Job filled.  That's right.  Adam Carolla.  That job has been filled.  Good day, sir.  Good day.  Hey, man, I hope the Flying Hollander brothers weren't bullshitting us.  They said that CBS would not hire them.  Apparently, they were at a ball game there with Steve Dahl also. 
[03:03:00]  And that didn't stop Steve from going on the show and just tearing apart Man Cow and saying,  no, he's not going to show up over here.  Let's say hi to Patty's Hyman.  Patty's Hyman.  Hi, Hope.  Hi.  I was an actor who was paid to perform pre-fabricated skits and sketches on Man Cow's show.  Oh, really?  One of those?  We heard about these. 
[03:03:30]  Howard got accused of using a couple of these back in the day.  I went for the same producer who did the ones for Howard's show.  Yeah.  What they do is they come up with a subject that they want to talk about and get callers to call in.  Oh, how he faked shit.  And they're actors.  And they're called up.  You know, the producers of these shows have these people's numbers.  And they call up with various subjects and try to get interesting banter started.  Like what kind of stuff would you do?  Yeah, give us an example.  Well, a producer would call me up with about four or five different possible themes or scenarios. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah.  And he would pitch them to me.  The ones that I did for Man Cow were usually religious and or vaguely homoerotic.  Really?  Yeah.  I was asked to choose to pretend to be a young Christian wife whose husband had been asked to join the Freemasons.  Yeah.  And then I had to pretend like it really upset me because I thought my husband might be bisexual. 
[03:04:30]  So he'd be like, so now what's making you believe that your husband's bisexual?  Exactly.  Now you're supposed to, like, do what you did.  And I was like, oh, yes, it's really disconcerting to me.  They're so secretive.  I'm not sure what they're doing at those meetings.  But you really stink at it.  No, you're good so far.  I was right in the moment.  We're going to team you up at Steve in a minute here.  We're going to have to use you. 
[03:05:00]  All right.  I'm sorry, guys.  No, it's fine.  We're just fucking with you.  Get Ben Sparks' number.  We might use you.  Yeah, we might use you.  Yes.  Did that bit air on a show?  It aired on a show.  And apparently the longer you stay on the air, the better you are.  And I was on for about three hours over the course of one show.  Wow.  What a tool.  All right.  Thank you, Patty Simon.  Goodbye.  Bye, Patty Simon.  Saved AM radio.  I'm going to save FM radio. 
[03:05:30]  Well, wait a second.  You're continuing to do the show, but not at that station.  It's syndicated.  You can still hear me now.  So how do we get you?  So if someone wants to get you, how do we do it?  Well, I mean, send me a plane ticket.  Let's plan a nice weekend.  Program directors?  Program directors?  You know, look, we're syndicated around America.  I'm probably owning your city.  Check your local papers.  If we're not alone, we will be.  Well, you know what, Mancow?  Sure you will be.  It's very revealing talking to you today about how your management wasn't crazy when you 
[03:06:00]  appeared here and said the stuff.  We've always loved you because you're honest, and they didn't like it.  Honest.  Well, you know, guys, it's the strangest thing.  When I was running naked down the streets of Chicago, I was a hero.  But when I started to develop some core values and talk about my children, the ratings exploded.  I started to do good, and it worked.  Mancow worked here in this city.  Well, we've got to keep talking to you.  See you guys.  God bless.  Good luck.  We'll keep you posted on Mancow.  Fox and friends. 
[03:06:30]  When I started developing some values, what did he say?  The ratings exploded?  Yeah, they did.  Boom.  Kaboom.  Go the ratings.  We've got inside people all over the place.  Oh, what do you got there?  I don't want to blow up his spot, but someone from a very important,  that rag magazine.  Uh-huh.  That, you know, radio rag magazine.  Good enough.  Okay, you know what I'm saying.  It's just to show you.  Oh, I know.  I can't blow up his spot.  I know, by the way.  Because he gives us a lot of great inside info. 
[03:07:00]  Is it Eric Nagel?  Mancow's AM drive ratings.  He said they exploded, right?  He said they've never been better, right?  Never been better.  When he was running naked down the street.  So he started talking about family values and being a Christian and all that.  The ratings, what?  Exploded?  What was the quote?  Exploded.  All right.  Person's 12 plus.  Mm-hmm.  He had a 2.9 in the last book.  That was good enough for 11th place.  11th place.  Person's 18 of 34.  He was in third place. 
[03:07:30]  Person's 25 to 54.  That's a big advertising demo.  Yeah.  He was in 12th place.  12th.  Men 18 of 34.  He should be number one no matter what.  Right.  That's the easy one.  That's the demo.  He came in second.  Second.  See?  Not first.  Men 18 of 49.  He's in third.  They need those two.  They need those two bad.  Yeah.  Stations want you to be number one.  Men 18 of 34.  Men 18 of 49. 
[03:08:00]  And when he was shock jock, I believe he was number one in those demos.  By far.  Howard in his day couldn't even touch him.  Yeah.  Men 25 to 49, 5th place.  Men 25 to 54, 7th place.  How do you fucking lie when the numbers are available?  Easily.  When, when, I guess because the people, the general population is never going to hear the numbers  or get ratings books or have friends in the business that send them the numbers.  The papers ought to be all over this though. 
[03:08:30]  Take his quotes and then pick them apart and go, this guy is a lying sack of shit.  All right, here we go.  Juggernaut.  He's a ratings juggernaut.  There's a guy that keeps me entertained every day after the show.  Oh.  His name is good old Lord Westfall.  This guy is a ball buster.  Right.  We know him. 
[03:09:00]  Wait, who is that?  I know that name.  Oh my.  He goes after everyone that works for Exxam.  The CEO.  Oh, yeah.  He's very angry at the company.  He's a fan of our show?  No.  We don't even know.  I don't think so.  No, he is.  Yeah?  Well, because I engaged in some emails with him.  I'm like, well, dude, what the fuck?  Because he would go after us.  He'd call us out on what we say about Exxam saying, hey, but this, this, this.  Right.  Like, oh, dude, shut the fuck up.  We're doing a radio show here.  So I got to the bottom of what he was all about.  He listens to us religiously. 
[03:09:30]  He's a good egg.  He writes, so Man Cow, the official cow of Mantown,  was fired by Emmis.  In nearby Little Rock, there's a billboard that has Man Cow's face,  which has been altered to look like the Terminator.  And a caption that reads, I shit you not,  Terminate morning boredom.  I have, I have frequently thought this billboard would be funny if it kept the same caption, 
[03:10:00]  but instead pictured a machete, Man Cow, and Al Zarkawi.  But I find it ever more humorous that his employer apparently followed the billboard's instructions  and actually terminated morning boredom.  Guy is great, man.  That's funny.  Guy is great.  All right.  That was it with the sound.  Oh, yes, he said God bless.  That's the, uh...  Man Cow isn't really Christian, just jumping on bandwagon.  Uh, let's see. 
[03:10:30]  And we'll end with this.  Kelly in Wisconsin.  Kelly.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, guy with girl name.  Thanks, Jim.  I grew up just outside of Chicago, listened to Man Cow for a while,  but the last couple of years, I've been waiting for something like this to happen  just to hear the sound of his head popping out of his ass.  Dude, what has he been, what has he been doing, like, as far as Christian and talking about his kids?  Like, what, what would be the subject matter?  How would he talk about it? 
[03:11:00]  You know, I stopped listening to him about two years ago.  Oh, so you didn't even get to hear that part of it?  No.  And what he doesn't understand, see, he's, he's another radio host full of himself thinking  because, uh, his kids bring him such joy in his life, he needs to talk about on his radio,  uh, talk about that on his radio show?  We told you guys a long time ago.  That's how we got popular.  If you're a radio host, you should not be talking about your children, your kids.  You shouldn't have your wife or girlfriend on the show.  I totally agree, but all I got to say to Man Cow is good luck, bro. 
[03:11:30]  There you go.  Unless your kid's retarded and, like, you always hand them knives and, like, just play the audio on your show.  Why did I say that?  Please hold.  And...  Let me apologize.  Not only was that not a funny joke, it was just mean.  I got, but I got pleasure out of watching you squirm through it.  I feel bad I said that.  No. 
[03:12:00]  I make fun of retarded people, but if you get retarded kids, you know...  Yeah?  I ran out of phony empathy.  We have...  We have to talk about David Gast when we get back.  David Gast?  Did he?  Danny DeVito is calling any moment.  I hope so.  I love him.  Timberwolf accused of jerking off while driving.  We got the audio.  Justin?  Justin...  What?  Oh, it's Timberlake.  I'm fucked up.  I didn't mean...  Oh, wow. 
[03:12:30]  I'm tuckered out.  You're gonna give Stan Ryder's cramp.  Justin Timberwolf.  Oh, I should have fucking jism thrown in my hair.  Justin Timberwolf.  Ugh.  It's crazy.  It's what it's all about.  It's what it's all about.  Oh, I love this.  It's what it's all about.  Wow.  He showed 36 double D's.  He showed 36 double D's. 
[03:13:00]  Shoving her breasts in everyone's face.  36 double D's.  He showed 36 double D's.  Oh, wow.  He just looks hurt now.  He just looks hurt now.  Anywhere.  With a mouth one to stay.  She'll flash.  She'll flash.  Hey, I'm all for it.  She'll flash.  And there's boobs in your face.  I'm all for it.  With a mouth one to stay.  The night that you rest.  Hey.  You're a mouth one to stay.  This is what it's all about. 
[03:13:30]  You're a mouth one to stay.  Oh, I love this.  You're a mouth one to stay.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Right.  Oh, wow.  Whip them fuckers out.  This is fantastic. 
[03:14:00]  Wow.  It's wow.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  That's why we call it wow.  Talk about the boobies.  We're a mouth one to stay.  Take your braw and take it off now.  We're a mouth one to stay.  We're a mouth one to stay.  We're a mouth one to stay.  We're a mouth one to stay.  Wow.  We're a mouth one to stay.  We're a mouth one to stay.  We're a mouth one to stay.  We're a mouth one to stay.  We're a mouth one to stay.  We're a mouth one to stay. 
[03:14:30]  We're a mouth one to stay.  We're a mouth one to stay.  We're a mouth one to stay.  We're a mouth one to stay.  We're a mouth one to stay.  We're a mouth one to stay.  We're a mouth one to stay.  We're a mouth one to stay.  We're a mouth one to stay.  This is Ozzy Osbourne, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Stay fucking tuned, because I'll come and fucking kill your baby bed. 
[03:15:00]  We'll see.  I love Pelo.  Who the fuck is this?  All right.  This guy sucks.  This was a commercial hit in 1984, off The Ultimate Sin.  Not a particularly good video. Ozzy looked like Bette Midler in it. 
[03:15:30]  But still not a bad tune for 22 years old.  Motley Crue, the opening band on that tour.  On their Shout at the Devil tour.  Oh, the Shout at the Devil tour.  My first year seeing Ozzy.  I'm sorry, this is a...  No, no, I apologize.  This is the wrong...  I'm thinking of Bark at the Moon.  Oh.  This was Metallica.  Open for them out of the mystery.  You must be insane to not remember that.  Where's that Tom Cruise desk?  A lot in your mind.  I corrected myself.  Oh, here it is.  Thank you.  Hey, Timberwolf accused of jerking off while driving.  Wow. 
[03:16:00]  Let's get right in.  Put it away when you get pulled over.  Here's the audio.  Jesus, how big's that cock?  The guy saying he can't go to jail in the surveillance video obtained by the WCCO I-team  is 24-year-old Timberwolves center Eddie Griffin.  I'll pay for it.  Offering to buy a car for the man whose SUV he just crashed into in front of Santana  Foods grocery store in Minneapolis.  A lot of money.  It happened around 2.30 in the morning. 
[03:16:30]  Griffin pleads with witnesses not to call police and admits on tape he's drunk.  I'm drunk.  Oh, God.  So he got  It's hard to hear him  So what's going on  He got into a bit of an accident  He got into a wreck  Right outside of like  A bodega style deli  Yeah  And if  I don't know if you heard  In the clip  He says that he'd buy the guy  Any car to make up for it  He's going to buy the guy  Any car  But then he backs off 
[03:17:00]  He's like  He's like  If you want a Hummer  If you want a  Well not a Bentley  You know  Yeah  Well that's still like  A Hummer  But wouldn't the guy  Remember it the next day  Or you know  Yeah  How are you going to  Get that right  Once he's sober  Get some kind of contract  Written at that time  When he's drunk  And they're saying  He was jerking off  Yeah  That bombshell is laid  In the next clip  Oh wow  Let's listen  But it was a bombshell  This guy was wrapped  Around the tree  Abed Hassouni  Lives upstairs  And owns a store  He rushed outside  To find his brother's 
[03:17:30]  Suburban  Smashed into a tree  And this guy  Is trying to get  Get out of the car  My concern was  The first thing  Is to go out there  And see if he's okay  He came out  With a big  Alcohol breath  Hassouni says  Not only do the basketball  Player appeared to be drunk  He admitted to watching porn  While driving  He told me that he was  Masturbating himself  Going down the street  That's how the accident happened  Because he was not  Paying attention  He paid attention  To that video  And all of a sudden  He shoveled somebody's car  On top of the sidewalk  If that 
[03:18:00]  The guy was drunk  Watching porn  And jerking off  While driving  How do you not  Root for this team  To win the title  Next year  I fucking love him  No cell phone call  At the same time  Hello  Wow  Jerking off  That is  I don't believe  The center said that  I was jerking off  And I hit you  Who would admit that  Yeah why would you say  I was jerking off  Oh I'm sorry I did that  I was jerking off  Maybe you're so drunk  That you don't care  Hey look  I was jerking off  A little inside info  Here from Tim in Minnesota 
[03:18:30]  Tim  Hey guys  How you doing  It's an honor  We don't get many calls  From Minnesota Tim  Thanks for calling in  From the Twin Cities  Yes  This guy was the guy  That Mary Carey  Months ago  Talked about  When she was on your show  That she was banging  She loved the bang NBA star  She said  And this Eddie Griffin  Is one of the guys  That she mentioned  Who had a very large member  Wow  There you go  Alright  Maybe he was just jerking off  Because he's  He could do that  And still look straight out  Thanks guys  Punch it out  Don't ask me to explain it  Because I 
[03:19:00]  I realize that you can  Jerk off with a small dick  And still look straight ahead  Good shit dick  Danny just tripped on something  And almost cracked his skull  Oh he was laughing too hard  At your bum  I know he was  He can't blame him  He can't blame him  Can you imagine my joy  If Danny actually broke his neck  Laughing at me  No offense  Dan  I like you  Alright one more clip here  It's not clear why  But when Minneapolis police  Showed up here on the scene  They did not test Griffin  For alcohol  The ICIN has obtained  A copy of their accident report  They submitted to the state  It also does not mention 
[03:19:30]  Any alcohol tests  And it said the driver's condition  Was normal  And that no alcohol  Or drugs were involved  In the incident  But he was jerking off  And instead of being  Taken to jail or detox  Griffin says police  Gave him a ride home  We're going to look into it  Police Chief Tim Dolan  Says it's not department policy  To drive someone home  After an accident  And would have required  Special permission  For officers to leave the city  And take Griffin to his home  In St. Paul  Obviously if somebody  Is drunk and they're driving  We want that dealt with 
[03:20:00]  By the police officers  From Minneapolis  And when asked about  Griffin's use of alcohol  That night  You can hear on the tape  The officer at the scene  Telling Hassouni  And others in the store  That Griffin will not be charged  With driving while intoxicated  I feel insulted that my civil rights  Were ignored that night  Were put on the side  For a basketball player  I think  For a basketball player 
[03:20:30]  I don't think your civil rights  Were put aside  But he is right  The guy should have been  Whatever  Charged  Since when did I become  A fucking civic duty doer  A man cow  I've jerked off while driving  Have you  Please  Police who hasn't  Exactly  While driving why  Yeah  I don't know  You're bored  Yeah my grandma  My grandma that needs to go somewhere  I was giving her a lift  You've never done  Hey grandma  You've never whacked off driving  No  Oh my god  I got it  I got it

[03:37:30]  Ah, ah, ah.  Oh, yeah, we are home.  Please, more Bob Kelly.  Ah, ah.  Does Steve have an opinion on my story?  I don't know if he does, but I just noticed he was very opinionated,  and I told a story.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  It's a lot of Photoshop opportunities today. 
[03:38:00]  I'll tell you that much.  And that was, I was talking about, like, back when I was a kid,  and, like, you'd get the day off from school, a sick day or something.  Yeah.  And you'd be at home, and everyone's gone.  Yeah.  So you have the run of the house to yourself, and that's when you would take your time.  Because as a kid, it was very hard to find the time to get a good jacking in.  Yeah.  Really, think about it.  You always have somebody watching you.  Jess.  Hi. 
[03:38:30]  Hi, Jess.  Jess in New York, everybody.  Hi.  How are you doing?  Hi.  All right.  Is this more opiate tape?  Excuse me?  What's up, Jess?  Nothing, Jess.  Go ahead.  So when I was listening to Jimmy talk about being embarrassed about masturbating,  I think that's, like, a thing that girls really get a lot more than guys.  Thanks.  Because, I mean, think about it.  You're, like, sitting on your bed with a freaking vibrator going in and out of you.  You're using your head to push it in.  You're like, what the hell am I doing?  You have your cat sitting next to you staring at you.  Like, I was embarrassed in front of my cat, I think. 
[03:39:00]  Like, they're staring at you like, what the hell are you doing, you know?  How do you think your cat felt seeing your fingers dip in there knowing you were going  to feed him right after and tussle his chin?  I mean, it kind of looks like they're, like, they're judging you.  Like, I was ashamed to be in front of my fucking pets, you know?  Why were you embarrassed because the cat was watching?  Because right after you're done, he comes over and licks your fingers.  You know what?  He ran over the same way he does when you open up a tender vittles pouch.  I mean, I'm not going to lie.  I was fucking in this place.  The cat licked his fingers and then he threw up. 
[03:39:30]  Licked her fingers.  God damn it.  Licked his fingers.  Let's go to little cat fingers.  Let's go to Karen in Philly.  Karen.  Hi, guys.  How are you doing?  Karen!  Yeah.  How are you doing?  I'm good, thanks.  I was actually just calling to tell you a story about, I used to go to Virginia Tech  several years ago and I used to drive home all the time to work.  And a Toyota MR2 with, what are they, T-tops?  So it's essentially with a whole roof with glass. 
[03:40:00]  And it's a long drive.  I used to, you know, play with myself and masturbate.  I used to drive between trucks so I know that they could see everything.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The truckers always talk about the girls' pleasure in themselves and them being able to look right down.  Right down in.  I mean, Opie's right.  You get bored and you just have to entertain yourself, so.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you.  There goes Karen.  People driving, though.  Hey, FH Riley's Friday.

I want to hear Frank the Frowner sing.  Because it's a small place.  I want to hear Frank the Frowner croon a song. 
[03:41:00]  I understand Frank's a big fan of Da Do Run Run.  Da Do Run Run.  I want to hear him sing Send in the Clowns.  That's a sad, sad song.  I don't know the lyrics.  I don't know either.  The lyrics.  Can we get the lyrics and then maybe try it out a little bit after the break?  Send in the Clowns.  Oh, yeah, because it's all frowny face.  Yeah, I believe I thought of frowns.  Send in the frowns.  Send in the frowns.  Wow, that would work.  Well, let's get those lyrics for...  All right, we'll give it a shot.

[03:42:00]  Oh, God.  My poopy hurts.  Don't be such a girl, Travis.  I got to tell you, today I was feeling pretty good about ourselves as far as the radio show 
[03:42:30]  goes.  Yeah.  Danny DeVito isn't calling this program today.  Well, you say that, but as I look, I see Danny walking out of the engineering.  Hi, Danny.  I think you guys are wrong.  I was feeling really good about ourselves, like, wow, the big stars are finally coming  on our show.  No.  And the excuses are trickling in from L.A.  First, it was he's a little late.  Running late.  So, he's 20 minutes behind.  That was at, I got to be honest, that was at about 10-10.  Yeah.  20 minutes is way over now. 
[03:43:00]  Then it was, he just woke up.  Was it he just woke up?  He just, he overslept in L.A.  Maybe, maybe, here's what happened.  I think he overslept.  And I think he's, um...  Oh, that's old footage.  Doing some, uh...  That's old footage.  Oh, you should have to fly off.  I think he's doing, uh, probably other interviews.  He probably has to catch up.  He probably overslept and is catching up on interviews.  I don't think that's crazy.  He's calling at 11 confirmed.  Okay, fine.  Yeah, he's fine. 
[03:43:30]  11?  He's an hour lady.  We're out of here at 11.  Well, wait a few minutes for that legend.  No!  Oh, uh...  Old Beacons!  Let's say hi to Bill in Texas.  Who's this guy?  Bill?  Hello, Bill!  Rick in Michigan.  We're running out of show.  We don't have time to, like, hold your hand today.  Rick!  How's it going?  Hey, man.  Right now, Rick.  What's up?  Hey, I got a disgusting wow for ya.  Okay.  All right.  I don't have a wow sticker, but I write it in my back window with, like, window chalk. 
[03:44:00]  Yep.  And I was sitting at a light, and this lady pulls up next to me, and she says,  What is wow?  And I told her to whip them out.  Whip what out?  I said, them.  And the light changed, and I took off.  She pulls up next to me at the next light, and she had her top-down, disgusting pancake  boobs hanging out.  Nice.  Still hot.  Not really. 
[03:44:30]  Not really.  Well, it's still boobs.  It's like, we don't guarantee the quality of the breasts, sir.  I'm not blaming you guys.  Just the fact that it does happen in time.  It's still good.  All right.  See how it works.  Thanks, Rick.  All right.  Thanks, Rick.  Hey, uh, most...  God, his delivery was so good on that.  I know.  Most obnoxious 30 seconds ever.  Got a, uh, got a, got an entry here.  Uh-oh.  Is it going to be loud?  I don't know who did this.  No one is claiming responsibility.  I have no idea what this is.  But, uh, they said, uh, this one is really good. 
[03:45:00]  The most annoying.  The most obnoxious 30 seconds ever.  So we asked the question, is this the most obnoxious 30 seconds ever?

[03:46:00]  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Inside job, huh?  It is an inside job.  Mutiny, I say.  It's mutiny.  Hey, I don't really know much about Derek, to be honest with you.  No one does.  He's a bottom.  He's a bottom.  Could have been Travis.  He would have needed somebody to help him lift the CD.  Yeah.  And there's a risk involved in that.  Yeah.  I have the boss making angry.  I'm getting mad.  It might be a Superman thing.  What do you mean? 
[03:46:30]  Like, he actually doesn't give a shit about risk.  Maybe not.  You're saying that he's...  When he's not in front of us.  You're saying he's a superhero?  He might be a superhero.  Some kind of dope.  Called the risk taker.  Risk man.  Able to slip under doors, single bound.  Look in a robe, drinking broth.  It's...  All right, let's say hi to Mike in Pennsylvania.  Mike.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, Mike?  Uh, I had an embarrassing, uh, jerk-off story. 
[03:47:00]  Yeah.  A teenager up in my room.  My father walked in on me with my dick in the vacuum cleaner.  Oh, boy.  Does that really work?  Well, I was just doing it, you know, because suction.  I mean, I wasn't trying to get a dick.  We understand why.  No one thinks you were trying to clean the living room better.  I think that's an urban legend.  I don't think, uh, I don't think it's...  I don't think you can actually...  I don't think you can get anything done with that. 
[03:47:30]  Oh, yeah.  I think it's the, um, suction.  It wouldn't have to be, like, suction.  Not one suction.  Well, maybe you work the hose.  A little on, a little off.  I've never done this.  Don't start looking at me like that.  How embarrassed were you at that time?  Ah, that was pretty embarrassing.  Then your bag's skin gets caught in it.  Makes that horrible sound.  And it pulls all the skin up over your dick like you're uncircumcised again. 
[03:48:00]  Cock looks like a fucking...  It looks like a cocktail frank.  Little pig in a blanket.  Hey, here's the latest on Tom Cruise's Kid.  Okay, so we're all desperately seeking Surrey Cruise, right?  Well, according to Us Weekly Magazine,  some Telluride, Colorado residents ran into what the world has been waiting for.  Tomcat's kitten, yes.  When Katie, who's in town with Beyoncé Tom,  was spotted yesterday at about 7 p.m. strolling the streets with a friend,  she didn't have Surrey in her hands, only a cup of Joe. 
[03:48:30]  Although she did dish about her daughter.  Surrey's doing great.  She's back at the house, Katie said,  before jumping into the passenger seat of her Blue Hummer H3 and heading home.  But locals are claiming they've seen Little Miss Cruise, saying she exists.  I saw her thick black hair and her fingers are small.  My goodness.  Why is fucking music playing?  84 days after she was born at St. John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California.  We're up to 84 days?  That was yesterday.  Day 84.  Can we start the clock?  Sure. 
[03:49:00]  Every day?  When?  Today is the 85th day officially.  85 days, no official sighting.  Well, we see Tomcat's kitten.  They saw the kid.  It has small fingers.  Yeah.  And dark hair.  And dark hair.  Mm.  Sounds like Voss.  Sounds like a baby from, I don't know, at least 100 countries.  Paraguay.  Yeah, it could be from anywhere.  It could be from Paraguay.  It's one of those to feed him for like 30 cents a day, kids. 
[03:49:30]  Little flies.  What is going on?  There's something fishy.  One of those South American countries where they all wear those derby hats.  Yeah.  Have the faces that all look alike.  You know, like your landscaper.  New moms don't like leaving their newborns.  She's walking around with Starbucks coffee and doing this and that.  And there's always the excuse she's home.  Oh, you just missed her.  Yeah.  She just took off in her Porsche.  It's the just-missed-her game. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah.  Oh.  The birth certificate is a little screwed up.  85 days and counting.  The pressure's on, too, because now the mainstream media's all over it.  Yeah.  Tabloids were having fun with it, but now the mainstream media's like, yeah, what the fuck  is up?  It'll be uneventful.  I mean, it'll be a big deal.  It's probably just a regular dumb kid.  I don't know.  Something's going on.  It's going to age like soap opera kids, where one year they're just born, and then three  years later they're running the company at 18.  Right. 
[03:50:30]  Let me tell you something, Dad.  I'm not taking your crap anymore.  Wait a minute.  Weren't you three, like, a year ago?  Dad, I know what I'm talking about.  I wasn't born last season.  No, you were, son.  Oh.  Oh.  You have little fingers and dark hair.  Okie dokie.  We're kind of just wasting time, I'm going to be completely honest with you.  Is Danny DeVito calling or not?  I say yes.  I say no.  He's confirmed.  He'll call.  Confirmed.  He'll call.  He's just delayed.  He's a big star.  Ben Sparks writes, confirmed. 
[03:51:00]  Confirmed?  Well, that's a big help.  I have faith in Ben.  Guys.  Dude.  I know how.  Wait, wait, wait.  Little E's calling me out from Atlanta saying, Tomcat's kitten deserves a car crash.  I was quoting what the fucking tape said.  The stupid entertainment bitch had said, Tomcat's kitten.  Ew.  Tomcat's kitten.  If you listen a little close, bend it your fucking ears, jackass.  And what's his name?  Little E from Atlanta.  And Little E, we're very lucky today because Anthony actually admitted he was wrong. 
[03:51:30]  That's right.  Little E, I'm banning you.  Don't ban him.  I had to ban him.  I'm going to ban him out, Ope.  I'm going to ban him for not listening.  I had to correct him.  All right.  We have to make a pact.  Right now.  Okay, I won't ban him.  How long do we wait for Danny DeVito?  Give him a few minutes after 11.  Yeah, because.  No, I want an exact time because I know how this plays out.  11.  10.  I have a decorator to see today.  I say 11.  We're shocked jocks, dude.  Shocking.  And it's shocking that I'm doing this. 
[03:52:00]  That's the shocking part.  I'm starting to think it might not be.  You're turning into metro jocks.  Metro jocks.  Metro jocks.  I say 11.  10.  I, uh, yeah.  I say 11.  I'll say 11.07.  I say no show.  11 o'clock.  No, I say 11.10.  How about, Jimmy, you just sit around?  I would.  To interview Danny DeVito, I would.  You sit around and take phone calls.  Yeah, I'll talk to him.  You're going to be very disappointed.  I'll wait.  He'll call.  I guarantee he calls him.  I'm going to give you, I told you so's. 
[03:52:30]  Guarantee he'll call him.  Doesn't the publicist realize we leave at 11, officially?  So, can we find out when he's calling, if it's confirmed?  Ben says it is.  And he'll call at 11, or a moment or two after.  He's Danny DeVito.  This is not just some shlug.  He can't keep calling him.  Can't call a man like Danny DeVito like that.  He'll call.  We're not just wasting time.  We're having fun with a capital F.  I'm going to ask some good questions, too.  How does it feel to be an actor? 
[03:53:00]  What do you do with your hands?  I'm going to ask him that.  I'm going to ask him that, though.  I'm sure he hasn't seen Lucky Louie.  You can bet I'll toss that in.  You know, just two men of the same ilk discussing something.  Of course.  From sitcom legends.  I, too, will wait for Danny DeVito to call.  I think it's going to be worth it.  How often do we get a guy like that and voted by TV guy the fucking best sitcom character  ever?  And we will never get it.  We will.  I think you're being a naysayer. 
[03:53:30]  The man got up late.  It happens.  Nay?  Nay?  I was supposed to call in a few times into the show, and I'm a member of it, and I would  oversleep when I was in L.A.  Right?  Remember, guys?  We would talk.  Yeah.  I mean, it happens.  Here's CokeLogic's parody of Steve's Blink promos.  It's short.  Eggs.  Fish.  I'm running out of ideas for promos.  Time to update my resume.  Steve's a queer.  Opie and Anthony. 
[03:54:00]  Steve's a queer.  People get mad when I say it, but new bit.  New bit.  That's right.  Hurt Steve's feelings, bitch.  Makes Steve feel bad.  I hope people understand the backstory on that, because this is where, you know, you need my  help to over-explain things.  Right.  I feel like I shouldn't over-explain as much.  Over-explaining Opie.  By the way, I got, um...  Steve was doing inane promos like that.  Yes.  That meant nothing to anybody that listens to the program. 
[03:54:30]  And there you go.  There's the parody of it.  I had an announcement.  I forgot it.  Yes.  Damn it.  Wait.  It was about something.  Can I hear that again?  Well, Jimmy thinks.  I had a thought.  Oh.  Oh, I know.  Okay.  Bitch.  I'm running out of ideas for promos.  I'm running out of ideas for promos.  Time to update my resume.  Steve's a queer.  Opie and Anthony.  There you go, people. 
[03:55:00]  Your new mission.  I think it's next Wednesday, actually.  It's the second annual Jimmy Day.  What?  No.  It was just Jimmy Day.  No, it was a year.  It has not been a year.  Because it's my birthday next week.  No, it's not.  You know, t-shirts were made for that?  No, I'm not accepting, even if it is.  Nope.  July 19th.  Is it?  My birthday.  You know, t-shirts were made for Jimmy Day.  Really?  And XM paid for them and everything.  And I think we never gave them away.  Collect his items.  Who are they? 
[03:55:30]  It was your face.  On eBay now, my friend.  It was your face in a balloon.  Let me see one.  I want to see one.  It's really funny.  I don't know.  Do we have them here?  Why wouldn't we?  I heard that XM paid for them.  My brother did the design.  And we never gave them away because Jimmy Day got screwed up.  Oh, okay.  Well, I would love to see them.  My face is on a shirt.  I want to possess it and wear it around and point at it.  No. 
[03:56:00]  We don't have any?  Why would we have a shirt?  Do we have the shirt?  Do we?  No.  Line 11?  Yeah.  Hmm?  And it's...  Who is it?  Who is it?  Let's go to it.  It's...  Who is it?  No?  No.  Someone effing with us. 
[03:56:30]  Who's on line 11?  Travis, what do you know?  What do you know, Travis?  Come on in here.  Door barely has to crack.  Roland's talking to someone right now.  I don't know.  Is she?  Someone.  Danny DeVito.  That's right.  Okay.  Cool.  That's all.  Roland's probably prepping him.  All right.  Get Roland in here.  While Roland's talking.  He's going to be on in two minutes.  He's calling right back.  There you go.  Oh.  The publicist calls late.  He's calling.  So he's ready for him.  Two minutes.  Two minutes.  Two minutes.  It's 11 o'clock. 
[03:57:00]  You do realize that.  I told you before 11.10.  We go home at 11.  You do realize that.  I don't care if people are paying.  Show that to Jimmy.  I want a copy of that.  Well, obviously.  There's more on the back.  Well, why would no one give me one?  What?  What?  Line 8.  Danny Bovito.  Did you see the back of it, though?  Danny Bovito.  Oh, it's funny.  It's a cool shirt. 
[03:57:30]  Very cool.  I want a Jimmy Day shirt.  And the second annual Jimmy Day is this coming Wednesday, July 19th.  Is it really your birthday?  July 19th is my birthday.  Happy birthday.  I'll be 25.  Oh, getting up there.  Wow.  That's a big birthday.  I'm an older gentleman.  A little guy like you.  I think everyone should sing happy birthday to me.  It's Friday at FH Riley's.  How about no?  Why not? 
[03:58:00]  I deserve a happy birthday song.  No.  Two minutes?  I'd like one.  It's now past two minutes.  We look really silly.  This was scheduled for...  And by the way...  10 o'clock.  That's what I see.  Danny DeVito, Phoner, 10 a.m.  Okay, it is now 11 a.m.  And, yeah.  Working on getting me a computer from the other place.  Well, that'll be nice.  End of August.  End of August. 
[03:58:30]  Why so long?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I just want to be loved.  I don't see the...  What questions are you going to ask Danny DeVito?  We got to look.  Yeah, give us a little thing here.  We got to stretch.  Hey.  How you doing?  I don't know.  What are you talking about?  I want to do this praising.  How about War of the Roses?  Dude.  His role in War of the Roses.  He's been in some amazing films.  Just amazing.  That's right.  Guy's hilarious.  Amazing actor. 
[03:59:00]  What's the new show?  It's called It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.  It's on FX Thursdays.  All right.  At 10 o'clock.  Do we have an update on Danny DeVito?  We're in bowl time.  I heard, Opie, that a minute and 45 seconds ago, I heard that it was going to be two minutes.  Right.  All right.  He produced Pulp Fiction.  Really?  Yeah.  We got to ask him some Pulp Fiction questions.  Yeah.  He produced, obviously, Pulp Fiction.  All right. 
[03:59:30]  He produced Get Shorty, Aaron Brockovich.  I mean, you know.  This could be one of our bigger interviews.  Produce?  Danny DeVito, yeah.  Right up there with Richard Dreyfuss, right?  Yeah.  Absolutely, man.  Look at his resume.  Is he at Richard Dreyfuss level, though?  Danny DeVito?  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  He's in Cuckoo's Nest.  He's fucking Louie from Taxi.  I mean, Dreyfuss is Dreyfuss, but film-wise.  But look at the movies he's been in.  Twins, Throw Mama from the Train.  All right, twins.  Twins.  Wow.  Who did I play in Twins?  Give me my name. 
[04:00:00]  Phil Connor.  Phil Connor.  Was that Arnold's name in that, or no?  No, it's Groundhog Day.  Oh.  There he is.  It's the only fake name I know.  Oh.  Well.  Yeah, of course.  I told you guys.  All right.  You got him.  He's there.  Mm-hmm.  Where?  Eleven.  One second.  One second.  I know if Travis hits the wrong button, he's fired. 
[04:00:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Danny DeVito.  Hey.  What's going on, Danny?  Hey, I'll be in Anthony.  How are you, sir?  That is Danny DeVito.  What's happening, you guys?  It is confirmed.  Danny DeVito is calling into our show.  We were worried you weren't going to call in.  We're very happy you did.  We're a little gun-shy with big stars.  Oh, yeah.  Because, uh...  Well, you see, it's just, uh, you know, two o'clock, four o'clock in the morning where  I am.  Where are you?  The fans?  I'm only kidding. 
[04:01:00]  It's like...  Uh, you know, I had to get up early to do it.  It is early, though.  You guys, I'd do anything.  You probably...  Oh, thank you, Mr. DeVito.  Danny, can I ask you an honest question?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, please.  Do you even know who we are?  I happen to fuck you.  Yeah, see?  That's what we like.  All right.  We like the honesty.  Some honesty.  We like the honesty.  I prefer a lie.  Yeah, you guys are great.  I'm a fan.  Yeah, you guys are great.  Because this poor guy, you got a whole list of people you got to call today, and you got 
[04:01:30]  to make believe you're friends with all of them, right?  You got that ring to your voice, you know?  Oh, yeah, sounds familiar.  That friendly ring.  I think I worked with you before.  Yeah, some...  You must know Jimmy Norton, star of HBO's Lucky Louie.  Of course.  He doesn't know.  Finally.  Thank God he doesn't know.  I would be so pissed if Danny DeVito knew Jimmy.  Because occasionally, people come in, big celebrities, well, not big, you know, middle  of the line guys, and they know Jimmy. 
[04:02:00]  They turn around and go, oh, I've seen your stand-up, or oh, I saw you on Tough Crowd  with Colin Quinn, or something.  And it pisses me off, because Jimmy then...  I thought you were kidding me.  No, I'm a comic.  My name is Jim Norton, and occasionally, somebody very famous will know who I am, but it's normally  not somebody I love, like yourself.  That's usually the rule.  If I love somebody, they've never heard of me or seen me.  What made you want to go back to TV?  I mean, you've got such a great film career, I mean, obviously...  Yeah, I've got all this stuff going and everything, but the idea is, it's always funny, it's, you 
[04:02:30]  know, it's like written by these young, talented people, and it's very, very edgy, and I saw  the first season.  They did a season, seven shows, and I thought it was really, it was really terrific.  It had, like, you know, themes they took on, like, crazy-ass stuff that they started doing.  And then when Landgraf, who was the head of the company there, he said, you know, they  were thinking of adding a character.  I said, well, maybe, you know, I'd give it a think, a little, you know, try. 
[04:03:00]  If the character is, you know, kind of organic and has an edge that doesn't seem tacked on.  So they went out and they wrote ten shows, and they actually pitched me a really good  idea, and then I said, yeah, and then they wrote these wonderful ten shows, and I play  the father of two of the people on there.  And it's like getting up in the morning, you know, you get up in the morning, you really  want to go to work, that kind of thing. 
[04:03:30]  You're looking for that kind of thing.  I remember that.  I had it many, many times.  Yeah, I know you don't have it now, but I mean, like, I remember that, you know, many,  you know, lots and lots of shows, movies, that I do, that that happened, and I have  this same feeling now with this, it's always sunny.  You get there, and there's always fresh, funny kind of things that you're doing.  Like, my sisters live in Jersey, they live down on the shore, and they're a little older 
[04:04:00]  than I am, and they always watch my career, and they go, and, you know, I can always tell  what's going on with them, you know, they go, like, they call me after they saw this  first show, and they went, ah, ah.  That's it.  Yeah.  So you're on television again.  Again.  That Jersey honesty.  Yeah.  So you're on television again.  Like the first time with nothing.  It's not like the first show.  This show is like, you know, you were talking about cripples. 
[04:04:30]  I said, well, Ange, like, the thing about it is, like, the guy got hit by a car.  Yeah, I saw it.  The guy got hit by a car, and then, you know, he had to be put in a wheelchair.  He had broke his legs.  And we took him to a strip bar so that he could have some fun.  But we noticed that all the girls were going around him.  So we decided to all go get wheelchairs and come back into the bar and get some women. 
[04:05:00]  And so, you know, it's a show for a lot of people, but not for, like, my 75-year-old  sister.  You obviously, I mean, look, you were voted, I mean, for obviously as Louis De Palma, I  mean, you were, it was, TV Guy was your best sitcom character in history.  And I, obviously, there are things that you guys tackled in that show.  One of my favorite moments ever is, you remember when you drove Xena's girlfriend home and  she was on pills so you open-mouthed kissed her and then wound up sleeping with her? 
[04:05:30]  It's like a date rape.  The fucking, and then the next morning she sobers up and she goes, were you taller?  And he realizes that she's sobering up.  He goes, do you want more pills?  I'll get you pills.  You could not get away with that.  It's amazing, the content stuff.  And I always thought Louis was so great.  And I haven't seen this new character because even as great as Carol O'Connor was or Hawkeye  Pierce, but Louis, the way you did it is like you were not only funny and vicious, but  really, obviously, like lonely and wounded.  And I think that's what made people love you so much. 
[04:06:00]  Yeah, I think you're going to really respond to this character, Frank.  I've done 10 episodes every Thursday night.  What I do is I go, it's like that ritual, you know, now that you've got a show on the  air.  I go watch it at Thursday night and I really hold it up, you know, I really look at it  under a fine-toothed comb and I feel that this stuff is really, really pumping right up  to the level of where we were in Taxi.  It's like, no, you can't go back again. 
[04:06:30]  But it's got this kind of edgy, new kind of quality to it that is, and also you get  to do a lot more things on FX than you were able to do.  Well, that's true, yeah.  You've got a lot more freedom over there.  You've got a little bit more freedom, yeah.  And, you know.  And the more popular the show gets, the more freedom you seem to get over there.  Yeah, you push the envelope a little bit and you have, you know, you have some racy  fun.  What's some of the differences, though, between back then taping a TV show and now?  We're shooting this on, this was a show that was, I don't know if you know the history 
[04:07:00]  show was put on by these guys, Rob McElhaney, Glenn Howerton, Charlie Day, and this woman,  Caitlin Olsen.  She's adorable.  She plays my daughter.  Unfortunately, I won't get to bang her.  Well, you never know where next season could take you.  You never know.  But, you know, the show's differences, they, you know, they did a pilot, they did their 
[04:07:30]  own pilot for like $100 or something, just what the tape cost.  And then they sold it to FX two years ago.  And so they're innovative, like they're a story in themselves, just the fact that they  got this on the air.  And then the first season was like really good, very good writing, and they put it all  together themselves.  And then, then now, now the second season has really come up even a couple of notches. 
[04:08:00]  And we go, we shoot on TV, you know, digital video, digital video, and we, and we, you know,  it's very, you don't see a dolly track ever.  I'm talking about just technically differences.  You don't see the big bulky cameras.  We shoot with two, sometimes three cameras.  We shoot in environments.  We go to, we have a bar, we have a, we have a, you know, office, we have a thing, we have  a house side, we go on the street.  So it's a lot different than the traditional. 
[04:08:30]  It's a lot different than the traditional way.  We shot, you know, a taxi where it was confined to the stage with the audience and the stuff,  which is not, I'm not poo-pooing that.  I'm just saying that, you know, in the world we live in today, those other, those technologies  that have been discovered to be really very valuable are being put to use, you know, and  it's, it's freedom.  It gives you more freedom.  Do you laugh, do you laugh when you watch yourself on taxi? 
[04:09:00]  I, I, I do.  I do.  You, when you, when.  I get a kick out of myself.  Remember the episode, I mean, obviously this is annoying fan questions, but there was an  episode where you guys went back to where you were before you became who you are, and  you were talking to the old dispatcher, and you said, your wife's peach slop gives me  the trots.  You've said some of the funniest things in the history of television.  It was just so brutal when, when the relative died, and she, you said how, and she told  you when, and you said, I said how, you old bastard. 
[04:09:30]  It was unapologetic, and just, that's what television is, there was everything about Louis  should not have been likable, and yet it was the greatest.  Yeah, yeah.  Now he's a rare, he's a rare bird.  Now you pulled that off, yep.  Martini and Cuckoo's Nest, I mean, your resume, I, I, I'm a stand-up, and I do a little bit  of acting, and I want to just blow my brains out when I look at your resume, it's like,  you have done so many brilliant things.  You just got to keep doing what you do.  That's the thing.  I bet a dime.  I bet a dime, and then you tried to bet a nickel, you broke the cigarette, and you just 
[04:10:00]  wouldn't listen.  Yeah.  I'm really happy that you're, you're back, uh, doing a show like this, man.  Thank you, thank you, I'm really happy.  Yeah, when, when can we see this?  It's every Thursday at 10 o'clock.  Yeah, yeah, it's always sunny in Philadelphia.  All right.  On FX with Danny DeVito.  Busy man, Danny DeVito.  They're telling us now, uh, we got to let you go.  Thank you for all the, all the great moments in the last, man.  It's really, it's an honor to talk to you today.  Beautiful, man. 
[04:10:30]  And good luck with the show.  Thank you.  All right, Danny DeVito.  Take care, Danny.  Nice speaking with you.  You too, buddy.  There he goes.  Look at that.  Danny DeVito.  Nice guy.  You got to talk to Danny DeVito.  And he's nice.  Yeah.  Jimmy, you did a great job.  Yeah.  Um, do we, you know how close?  Well, I got it.  This is Greg Hughes, the actor that plays Opie and Anthony Shaw.  Oh, ladies and gentlemen.  And Greg Hughes.  There are times I get a very bad, uh, uh, rap that I'm an asshole.  Uh-huh.  I did write this down.  And I showed it to Anthony. 
[04:11:00]  Can you show me?  You, you, you did see that I was trying to get something going with Anthony, right?  I didn't.  I, uh.  You started looking over here because I was trying to pass his paper.  I read it.  I read it and agreed wholeheartedly, by the way.  He gave a thumbs up.  And then I got to be honest.  This is, Greg Hughes showing I have a heart.  I couldn't do it.  Couldn't do it.  On little Jimmy.  Let me see it.  Read what that says at the bottom of that page written in Opie's hand in ink.  Oh.  Bottom right corner.  No, you can't.  What does it say?  I would have got a huge laugh. 
[04:11:30]  You would have been pissed.  End of show.  What does it say?  Hanging up on Danny DeVito.  Hanging up on Danny DeVito.  I was going to give the big intro.  This is how it was going to play out of my head.  And then I just couldn't do it.  I was like, Danny DeVito, everybody.  The star of blah, blah, blah.  Danny, you're, uh, you're, you're late calling.  Yeah, well, well, the show's over.  We got to go home.  Good day, sir.  Click.  Which would have, yeah.  Which would have, first, let me, Jimmy might have cried. 
[04:12:00]  The panic ripples in, uh, the office because we would have ruined our relationship with  the publicist.  Jimmy would have, yeah, just been so pissed off, he would have stormed out of the studio.  But it would have been worth it.  It would have been worth it.  I know it would have been worth it.  Here's why it would have been a bad move.  I think, because the guy has done, he's contributed so much.  He's fucking, he's been so great.  You gotta, you gotta be a respected guy.  You gotta, you can't do it.  He hit it up when he said, be honest, do you know who we are? 
[04:12:30]  And he was like, no idea.  And he was funny and he was nice and he laughed at the taxi stuff.  He wasn't, he was great, man.  Yeah.  And he wasn't that late.  That was the problem I had to.  No, damn it.  Only an hour.  It felt a little too forced.  Only an hour late.  He was a nice guy and he was fucking Louie De Palma.  You gotta cut a lot.  Your wife's peach slop gives me the trots.  Peach slop.  That was a fun way to end the show.  Holy shit.  That was great.  All I wanted to do was quote his own lines to him.  I know and he liked it.  All day.  Dude.  You would have just been that guy. 
[04:13:00]  You want pills?  I'll get you more pills.  Oh, that's great.  You need to play Jimmy's cock gobbling sound for Danny.  That's good.  Jimmy sounded just like Chris Farley.  We know that.  I know.  I'm a dumb fan.  By the way, I've declared that bringing up the Chris Farley bit is now worse than the Chris Farley bit.
