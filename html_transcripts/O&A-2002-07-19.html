<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a chaotic and highly vulgar affair, revolving around several interconnected storylines. The show began with a recap of Ben's birthday party at "The Happy Ending," a former Chinese massage parlor.  Highlights included the lack of Captain Morgan and Coke, the sauna-like décor, and the attendance of celebrities like Andrew W.K. and Chris Barron.  Voss's behavior was a major talking point, characterized by excessive tanning, hitting on married women, and a surprising lack of knowledge about Tommy Mottola. Psycho Mark also appeared, making loud and offensive predictions, including one about an impending race war.  Steve's heavily intoxicated antics from the previous night were recounted, including his verbal abuse and a martini spill on Opie's brother. Numerous calls followed, with listeners vying for invitations to the Opie and Anthony party with the Crystal Method, resulting in humorous height and weight-based inquiries often tinged with racism.  The hosts also mentioned their rising Boston ratings and promoted photos/videos from a Buffalo trip on foundrymusic.com. The "F.U. Line" segment concluded this portion.

The selection process for female guests at the Crystal Method party dominated the next segment.  Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy Norton established stringent criteria, including height, weight, lack of menstruation, and boyfriend-free status, with graphic descriptions of desired physical attributes.  Numerous female callers were subjected to invasive questioning about their physical characteristics, with many rejected based on the criteria.  The conversation was heavily sexualized and body-shaming, with frequent references to a previous "Money Snatch" contest with similar judging.  Pablo Francisco appeared in studio towards the end of this segment, adding to the vulgarity. A technical issue interrupted a phone call.

The following segment was characterized by significant chaos and dysfunction.  It began with discussions of a repeatedly played "HIV song" and casual mentions of hookers.  Ben intermittently entered and exited the studio, culminating in him throwing an Andrew W.K. CD at Jim Norton. Doug U.L. guested, calling the show the "freakiest" he'd ever witnessed.  A significant portion dealt with Jim Norton's missing tooth filling, and attempts to reinsert it using ice water and tinfoil.  The "Christopher Street song" (an AIDS puppet song) was eventually played. Technical and logistical problems fueled increasing frustration among the hosts. Jim Norton’s Ticketmaster issues sparked arguments with Anthony and Francine, the intern, who was subjected to derogatory names. Ben’s prolonged absence due to a bowel movement further exacerbated the situation, alongside difficulties locating audio files.  A phone interview with Pantera's Phil Anselmo revealed his recent stomach surgery, methadone use, and various life anecdotes. The chaos escalated with a broken keyboard, resulting in keys being thrown around the studio.  A story about hookers remained untold due to the overwhelming events.  Calls from listeners, including twin 18-year-old sisters wanting party invites, were interspersed throughout. The segment concluded with continued discussion of the chaos, including multiple references to bowel movements, the broken keyboard, and the "tainted blood" motif.  Pablo Francisco was also a guest in this segment.

The final segment delved into bathroom anecdotes and bodily functions.  The hosts discussed an overstaying bathroom cleaner, sharing various embarrassing bathroom experiences, including witnessing a coworker eating pound cake during a bowel movement, observing an elderly man eating fried chicken in a stall without a door, and recounting several accidents and incidents of poor hygiene.  Stories involving fathers, fried chicken, and accidental defecation were shared.  Listener calls concerned Jim Norton tickets and a postponed show, alongside reading an email detailing paid sex.  The segment concluded with a discussion of high ratings in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and improving Sacramento ratings. The segment was filled with humorous, yet crude and offensive, bathroom-related jokes, descriptions, and personal anecdotes. No named guests appeared in studio for this segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, welcome to the O.P. and Anthony program.  What's up?  Well, lots going on today, Anthony.  How is everybody feeling?  Well, let's take a little check on how everybody's feeling.  I'm, uh, I'm all right.  Hey, there's something you don't see in a toilet every day.  Yeah.  Opie had a salad shooter dump before the show, so I hear.  I was trying to eat my tuna on white toast, and he's describing how stringy it was.  Well, sometimes you're proud of your dump, and you've got to share with others. 
[00:00:30]  I'm trying to eat.  I'm trying to eat.  It was one of those thready kinds.  It's breaking apart.  Thready.  Kind of like if you eat shredded wheat and you leave it in the milk too long.  Yeah, it just kind of falls apart on its own.  Tender.  Like stew meat.  Brown ivy.  Awful.  Ivy.  Feeling okay, though?  I'm fine.  Yeah?  Yeah, I didn't party too much last night.  Ben threw his own birthday party last night. 
[00:01:00]  Ben knows how to throw a bash.  Jesus Christ.  Yes.  He can throw a party, man.  That was a damn good time.  The only complaint that I had and a couple other people had was walking to the bar and  asking for a Captain Morgan and Coke, and there was no captain.  And I kept seeing.  It was funny as hell.  I go there and I'm like, ah, no, Captain, all right, I'll get an absolute screwdriver or  something.  So I sit down and I'm drinking.  I see Stinky come over to the bar and goes to the bartender and I read his lips.  Captain Morgan and Coke. 
[00:01:30]  And the bartender just shakes his head.  I can't hear a thing, but I know it.  And Stinky made that face like, now what?  Now you've got to stand there and try to decide what you're going to have.  So that was the only downside.  The bartender that looked like an extra from Forrest Gump.  Yeah, where's that bartender?  Right out of the 70s, man.  The roadie from Foghat.  Yeah.  He was cool, though.  We were just going back and forth.  The fall in 4th of July.  It was amazing.  So the only time I want to see that look is on a crucifix. 
[00:02:00]  Jesus with the wild Bill Hickok mustache and beard combo.  How did you not know there was no Captain Morgan?  There weren't funny red mustaches on everyone.  Dressed like a pirate.  So Ben throws his own birthday party at a place called the Happy Ending.  Cranky?  Oh, no, Happy Ending.  The Happy Ending.  Yeah.  But there is no sign out front.  Yeah, no sign.  What's up with that?  So you felt a little strange and weird and feeling a little guilty as you walk in this place 
[00:02:30]  because it says Chinese Spa or something like that.  That's the official sign outside.  Now you kind of get a little leery of what you're going to be walking into.  Oh, here it is.  The Zai He Health Club.  Better known as the Happy Ending.  And basically it's an old Chinese massage parlor that they turn into this really hip, cool New York club.  Club, yeah.  It's been written about in the local papers and stuff. 
[00:03:00]  And they still had the saunas and the Yankee Cranky little rooms.  That's what I was saying.  I saw all the saunas.  They're old saunas.  And now they put tables in there and it's kind of a little getaway booth for people.  They still have the tiles and stuff.  Yeah.  And I thought it was the Yankee Cranky rooms.  I thought that's where maybe they had a bed in there and a little cot and you got your Yankee Crank on.  I don't know.  Those were the saunas.  Was it?  Yeah, I do believe.  So the whole area, I guess, was where there'd be separate little locked off areas.  Yeah, because they kind of left the place how it was when they were Yankee and Cranky. 
[00:03:30]  I never went to a Yankee Cranky shop.  I've never been to a Yankee Cranky.  And, uh, Jim?  Yeah.  I can't believe you even had to ask.  Well, that's why I was saying.  See, Jim is so much on that side of it.  I thought Yankee Cranky would be like, nah, minor league stuff, you know.  You know what?  You're right.  I've done it probably three or four times in my life.  But you've got to start somewhere with your...  No, I went later in life.  Really?  I had a legitimate massage once. 
[00:04:00]  I was looking for a happy ending.  A little crankage?  Oh, she should have been working for, like, a sports team.  She's digging her fingers into my back and my neck.  And I'm like, all right, this sucks.  Roll over.  I'm trying to hint.  I'm arching my hips back.  You're missing something.  Nothing.  You're missing this muscle.  Nothing.  Nothing?  I'm like, should I tip you?  And she's like, no.  So there wasn't a Yankee Cranky shop?  That was one.  And the other one I went to was a house at, like, three in the morning.  And it really was more than Yankee Cranky.  Oh, really?  We had two people on the table.  And just the look, the eyes, her eyes were closed and she was looking away, like, probably 
[00:04:30]  just thinking of better times.  Oh, disgusted.  Yeah.  Really got me going.  That does sound like a bad experience.  Oh, I loved it.  That's right.  You should feel guilty.  It's the hierarchy of the Asian women that come to New York City.  Yep.  When they ship them over in those big container vessels and empty them out for their slave  labor.  They got three jobs they could choose from.  But I don't think they're allowed to choose.  They all come and they start in the Yankee Cranky shop.  They're appointed.  And then if they're lucky enough, they get moved to the nail places. 
[00:05:00]  Right.  And then if they do a good job in the nail places, they get the ultimate job, waitress  at sushi restaurant.  At sushi place.  We have it all figured out.  And the second, see, you know why they're so good with their service at the sushi place,  too?  Where they walk around, make sure that, oh, they're good, everything.  Oh, so sorry I get you the tea last night.  Because if they screw up, what happens?  Back to the nail place.  Back to the nail place.  Which is one step above the Yankee Cranky shop.  We got it all figured out.  We talked about this for hours one day. 
[00:05:30]  Because we saw her waitress and she was all nervous in her thin little Asian arms and she  was scared that she was going to get the order wrong.  Yeah.  And we could tell that she was on thin ice as far as the sushi restaurant goes.  I was under the impression she just got bumped up.  Maybe a double promotion because she had bruises on her arms where probably she was being  abused in some fashion.  Yeah.  It looked like finger marks on those little Asian stick arms.  Someone just holding them as they go over the edge.  Oh, please don't send me back.  So I guess Ben's party was so hip that some of the local newspapers want to write about it. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  There were some celebs down there.  Andrew W.K. showed up.  He showed up.  We were hanging, drinking.  He had a blast.  Yeah.  And Chris Barron was there for the Spin Doctors.  Me and Chris Barron were talking for a while.  He was drinking the Jameson.  He's like Pharrell.  He likes the Jameson.  Hanging out, talking music.  He was the head of the party.  Everyone couldn't believe that he was there.  Oh, my God.  That's the guy from the Spin Doctors.  Yeah.  It's pretty cool.  Well, he's got the band back together. 
[00:06:30]  They're touring around.  They had the biggest band in America in the early 90s.  Sure did.  Voss showed up.  Certainly did.  Voss.  First of all, okay, look.  There's dim.  It's nice club atmosphere.  Dim lighting.  A lot of candles and stuff.  A lot of candles.  Very cool room.  Voss comes in.  I swear to God, he looked like Uncle Sambo.  All I saw was his glowing choppers.  The guy is going to get...  Voss, are you listening somewhere?  You're going to get skin cancer. 
[00:07:00]  You're going to get skin cancer.  Did you see how dark this Jew was?  Yes.  And he swears it's from golfing.  He's like one of the original Jews from B.C.  Oh, golfing my ass.  Because at one point, he's showing the ladies.  He lifts up his shirt to show his abs to ladies.  His stomach was just...  It was darker than his face.  What's he...  I do shirtless golf.  He's not shirtless golfing.  Stop it.  You're tanning.  You're sunning.  You're doing something.  He's sunning his skin right off.  He's like an alligator. 
[00:07:30]  The guy is...  He was blacker.  Just about as black as Earl.  And this is why...  Not quite as lazy.  And this is why, Voss, you're finished in this business.  We were talking and the name Tommy Mottola came up and Voss went,  Who?  Jose.  That's why you're finished in this business.  Is he on the company that puts out lean cuisine?  Who's Tommy Mottola?  He doesn't know who Tommy Mottola is.  He doesn't know who Tommy Mottola is.  Absolute ass.  What a buffoon.  He's talking... 
[00:08:00]  Dude, I swear to you.  I swear to you.  I'm not exaggerating.  I'm talking to him.  And it was...  He is so dark.  And it was just candlelight and stuff.  It wasn't like it was pitch black.  Yeah.  I could not see features on his face.  I saw his eyes and I saw his teeth.  And then, like, you could tell there was facial features there somewhere.  But he's so dark now.  You thought it was dark last time he was in?  It's unbelievable how dark Voss is now.  All over.  And he's like, I golf. 
[00:08:30]  That's what happens.  I golf and I get a lot of sun.  No, you're not golfing shirtless.  He was trying to pick up all the ladies there.  All of them.  Nobody was safe.  No.  No girl was safe in there.  He's hitting on women that are there with their husbands.  Married women standing right next to the husbands.  Can I buy you a house?  It's like, who's the colored guy propositioning all the chicks?  See, Voss also thought...  Yesterday when he calls me, he goes, 
[00:09:00]  Just let all the ladies know that Voss will be there.  I'm like, Voss, there's a lot of people there that don't even...  Would never know who you are, you know?  I mean...  Let everyone know.  He was hitting on my architect's wife.  And I'm just like, dude...  Oh, God.  Just the most ridiculous, worst lines.  And then he would just go right to the next married chick.  Of course.  You know?  That's his game.  He doesn't mean it.  He's genuinely dumb.  Me, him, and this guy, Kevin Hart, a comedian.  We're all sitting on the stoop talking.  And this girl walks by and she happens to notice me. 
[00:09:30]  And she goes, oh, hey, weren't you with such and such last year?  She, like, went to a gig and I happened to be doing it.  So we're talking and this dummy, he doesn't even mean to be a C-blocker.  He just starts talking.  Oh, you're from Michigan?  Oh, it's pretty cool out there.  Blah, blah.  And he just starts...  Totally C-blocking him.  And me, but not in a malicious, awful way.  He's not trying to be a scumbag.  In a dolt Voss way.  He really is a Claude.  And then me and Kevin looking at each other like, what is this ass doing?  And then Dummy finally realizes what he's doing.  He has, like, the moment of clarity. 
[00:10:00]  And then he points at me and he goes, he's really funny, isn't he?  He's like, shut up.  Trying to recoup.  Yeah.  Help you out now.  You're awful compliments.  Yeah, he was a hit.  He was just walking around.  That was just a really good time.  We've got to thank Liquid Todd.  Liquid Todd was spinning.  Unbelievable.  Great job.  Does a great job.  Star-studded.  And then at the end of the night, just with Psycho Mark making his appearance, loud as ever,  talking about the most politically incorrect things one can say, 
[00:10:30]  he's gearing up for a big war that's going to be happening.  He's gearing up.  What kind of war?  A race war.  Against who?  He's convinced that there's going to be a race war in this country.  Does he realize that blacks and whites are getting along better than we've ever had?  And you know who else thought?  He thinks that's the calm before the storm.  You know who else thought there'd be a big race war?  Manson.  That's who thought there'd be a big race war and he would take over and lead the blacks.  That's what Manson thought.  That's what Mark thinks. 
[00:11:00]  Manson, not quite as crazy as Psycho Mark, though.  Jesus.  I think we're more worried about the Middle Easterns.  Yeah.  Oh, he just puts sand in front of the word he was using.  Oh, God.  And he's saying it so loud and he's just acting like a jackass.  A jack, jack, jack.  Hollywood Rich, a guy who actually Mark stole all his material from Boston.  Yeah, he was down there.  He was there screaming.  He does like a dog.  What would you describe that as?  I don't know what that is.  It sounds like a foghorn kind of yell thing.  And it's louder than you would think any human can make a noise over the music that was playing. 
[00:11:30]  You hear, oh, oh, oh, like this sound.  And you're looking over and there's Psycho Mark and his buddy sitting there laughing their asses off.  Oh, look, Mark's on the phone.  Hey, Mark.  Hey, what's up, boys?  How are you?  How are you feeling today?  Oh, a little hungover after last night's debauchery.  What is going on with the impending race war?  Oh, in which department?  Refresh my memory. 
[00:12:00]  I was a little bit out of it last night.  Well, I hear you're stockpiling stuff for an upcoming race war.  What?  What is Ben talking for?  Oh, get Ben.  You just said it last night, dude.  You were telling Anthony about the race war and how you're prepared.  What race war?  Oh, right.  You're preparing for a race war?  Ben, you're tripping.  I never said that.  You did, too.  What was he saying?  Anthony was right there.  Anthony was laughing so hard. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, it was great.  Yeah.  So, was I talking about all the guys that work in front of Fox?  There's no race wars coming?  No, not in the near future.  We shouldn't all stockpile Uzis like you were saying last night?  I never said that.  I need my job at Fox.  I can't say these things.  Shut up on a syndicated radio show.  I hear you, Mark.  I'm not a racist.  I hate everybody equally. 
[00:13:00]  Mark, you coming up to Boston for the Sam Adams thing?  Yeah.  Believe it or not, Jim Cook cordially invited me, so I'll have to make a journey up to Boston.  You know how when Jim Cook comes into our studio, we all sit and drink Sam Adams until we're ready to fall down?  Yeah.  They do the same thing at Fox.  In the morning, Jim Cook was there doing an appearance on what show?  Fox and Friends.  Yeah, Fox and Friends.  And Mark is there by, like, 9 o'clock.  He's hammered.  Everybody was hammered.  You would think TV would be a little different than radio if the beer guy comes in and you want to sit and tip a few with him. 
[00:13:30]  On the radio, it's like, all right, it's not TV.  But everyone was just hammered.  You should have seen the camera shots by halfway through the show.  It was beautiful.  Is this going to be the soundtrack to the race war?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Grab your weapons.  Here they come.  Look, I'm getting them out of my apartment building window.  Black Hawk down. 
[00:14:00]  Black Hawk down.  Load up.  Lock and load.  You're going to like this one.  Oh, yeah.  You're going to give them a little 20-bike bike.  There goes the Vulcan. 
[00:14:30]  All right, get out of here, Mark.  See you later.  Hey, Mark.  Yeah.  What an easy mark.  Jesus Christ.  Marianne, you were at the party last night.  What?  No, I wasn't.  Oh.  Oh, she wants to go to the party.  Oh, the other party that we're throwing.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right, hold on one second.  I guess that's all we have to say about Ben's party last night, right?  Yeah, yeah.  It was a good time.  Except for the fact that Steve and his tiny little stomach had a little too much to drink last night.  Oh, wait a minute.  God, is he loaded.  My God, we've got to bring this up. 
[00:15:00]  Tiny little stomach.  Get Steve from foundrymusic.com.  Get Sparrow Guts in here.  Dude.  He looked like he was on heroin.  His eyes were rolling around.  A thousand-yard marine stare?  Oh, boy, was he cranky.  Steve, everyone knows by now, had his stomach stapled.  He used to be a really big guy.  He's lost over a hundred pounds.  You know what the worst part is?  He doesn't know.  But he's having a tough time realizing that he can't drink as much as he used to.  Here he comes.  Wow.  Steve, what did I do?  Dude, you had the stare of death last night. 
[00:15:30]  What?  How come you get so angry when you drink?  Everyone else around here gets very happy.  We all get jolly.  We laugh.  We talk and have a good time.  You're the only one in our group that gets this look like Private Pyle before he blew  his brains out on the toilet.  I swear to you, I have no recollection of this.  That's the problem.  I'm standing there.  Steve and his girlfriend are there.  And I'm standing there. 
[00:16:00]  And Steve's like, oh, man, I think I messed up my stomach.  And I'm like, what do you mean?  He's like, I drank too much.  My stomach.  I hear this pained look on his face.  And his girlfriend's like, oh, it's time to get him out.  It's time to leave.  I didn't even say it, but it was in her eyes.  It was like that time ago.  Oh, jeez.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  No, I've got to watch it because in terms of amounts, I'm not actually drinking any more  than I was.  In fact, I'm drinking less.  It's just the effect is so much different now after this operation that I really have 
[00:16:30]  to...  You were never belligerent before?  I'm not saying that.  Apparently, this is new territory for me.  I've never been in more situations than I have been in the past six months where I'm  not remembering what the hell I did.  I can't imagine you not being with everybody from the show when you're out drinking because  we have...  A lot of the people with this show have kept you out of trouble.  Imminent trouble.  Trouble that was absolutely going to happen. 
[00:17:00]  I keep hearing about this.  Steve, calm down, man.  Steve, come here.  Walk away from this situation.  Because you're looking at people.  You get the look.  Your head goes down.  And you kind of look through the top of your eyes.  You're like...  And it's like, mother effer.  Yeah, mother effer looks at me one more effing time.  We're going to kick his effing ass.  And it's like...  What?  What did he do to you?  Oh, yes, Steve.  He did it last night?  I don't know.  Who the hell was I doing that to?  You were nice to my best friend, Dave.  You were cool. 
[00:17:30]  I liked it.  And then like an hour later, you went up to him and you called him an effing sea  bag and all this stuff.  And then...  You don't even know the other guy.  Then overall, he was on the other side.  You were like at one end of the bar and you just kept flipping him off and saying F you  to him.  So Dave comes up.  Dave's also very big and very tough, too.  I would never even think of effing with that guy.  So he comes up to me and goes, dude, that guy Steve really has a problem.  He just flipped me off.  He goes, he's a real dick.  He goes, dude, I don't want to start a fight or anything.  I don't want to fight.  But he keeps flipping me off and saying F you to me from the other end of the bar. 
[00:18:00]  Steve doesn't have any recollection of this.  Nor does he remember dumping a martini all over Opie's brother.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I got bumped by a waitress.  That I have full recollection of.  Yeah, I was sitting next to Opie's brother, Quinn, and his waitress bumped into me and  dumped a martini all over me.  Did you call her a C?  No, that was apparently while I still had a memory.  Then did you punch Quinn and Opie?  All right, I really got to watch the food.  When you can't remember...  Your chick was rolling her eyes going, I got to get him out of here.  He's gone.  You're headed for a murder. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, apparently.  Unofficial website.  And then I heard stuff from up in Buffalo when you guys went out.  Ben was saying, like, yesterday in the office, he was telling you what you were saying, and  you were like, no way.  No way.  He was leaving the place and saying, F these women.  F women.  I'm a millionaire.  I'm a millionaire.  Women suck.  No, well, that was...  Steve remembers all of it.  See, he was sober.  I go, dude, this is great stuff. 
[00:19:00]  Remember all of this.  And he was reminding me of some of the stuff.  I do.  All right.  Apparently, I'm not supposed to be drinking.  We made Steve.  The best with Steve, when he gets really hammered, he'll do just about anything.  Yeah.  We're hanging out at one of these clubs on Chippewa, and there's a bunch of girls hanging, right?  Yeah.  I go, Steve, go up to these girls and tell them that we're millionaires.  Yeah.  And he goes, hey, ladies, we're millionaires.  And then he goes...  And then he goes...  New gag.  Yeah, it's a new gag.  And then he goes, you don't mind that we're millionaires, do you?  Every two seconds of the conversation is brought up how everyone in the group is a millionaire. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  It was fun.  You don't mind me being a millionaire, do you?  And then the girls have to try to, you know, explain that they don't mind.  Right.  No, we don't mind, but not that we're millionaires, but it's very funny to do.  Oh, of course.  And another observation now from the party.  Frenchie's on the phone.  I've noticed something about Frenchie.  Frenchie.  Hey, what's up, guys?  You are the biggest pussy ever.  Oh, really? 
[00:20:00]  Is that so?  You know why?  Why?  What happens?  You, in front of your lovely wife, you will not do, you will not be Frenchie.  You are not...  I watch for a little while.  What are you talking about?  You don't even get hardcore.  People are there and they want to hear you like, suck it, you whore back.  And he's like, yes, suck it.  Then my wife will be horrified and say, shut up, you stupid French F.  He goes, yes, suck it.  Hi, I'm Frenchie.  And no see sucking in the evening.  What do you think, huh? 
[00:20:30]  His wife is nice, too, man.  You got to get that at least.  Yeah, very pretty.  Your wife is very pretty, man.  Oh, thanks.  Yeah, she has a nice rack, doesn't she?  I didn't look at her rack at a respect.  Well, I think everyone was, though.  That's great, Frenchie.  And also, I wanted to say hello to Steve, but I saw he was like totally F'd up on the corner  with a girl, talking to him, I guess it was his girlfriend, I wanted to introduce him  to my wife and say, you know what, forget about it.  He was totally annihilated on this side.  Annihilated?  You were annihilated or annihilated.  He was totally F'd up. 
[00:21:00]  It was good, though, last night.  It was a good time.  Yeah.  All right, Frenchie.  All right, guys, have a good weekend.  Yes.  And Anthony, you know what?  Suck it.  Yes.  Suck it.  Suck it.  All right.  Big Cap, what's going on?  Steve C, and the C is for combative.  What did he do to you?  Nothing.  I was just, I was with him both times in Buffalo and last night at the party, and wow.  It's something else.  That whole millionaire story is just, you're only getting the tip of the iceberg, because 
[00:21:30]  when the girls left, and we left that bar, Steve was going, oh, stupid girls, just stupid.  They're idiots.  Yeah, I remember being a little angry.  Yeah.  Yeah, and what about the strip club we walked in?  We walked into a lousy strip club in Buffalo.  There was one black chick doing a pole dance, and it sucked.  And Ben, before even scoping the place out, sits down and starts having a drink.  I walk out.  I walk into the club. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, is that what you remember, Steve?  Yeah.  I remember walking into a strip club full of black guys, and you screaming, this place  sucks.  Let's get the F out of here.  I can't believe this place.  As we're walking through the club with everyone looking at us.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  You've got to watch your ass.  That's what I remember.  You have got to watch your ass.  We didn't get beat up.  We're fine.  Yeah.  All right, big Kev.  Take care.  Kev.  He's going to fall for that.  You never know.  Malik, what's up? 
[00:22:30]  Hey.  Hello.  Yo, what up, 10 juices?  What's up, Malik?  It was cracking.  Yo, I want to give a shootout to my man, Psycho Monk.  Yo.  Yo, tell that racist I'm ready for his race war.  You know what I mean?  Tell him to come around that hood.  Ah, you're barking that cat.  Ah, yo.  I'm playing, plus.  All right, Malik.  Thank you.  All right, man.  Peace.  I said nothing of the sort.  I didn't say it.  What are you talking about, Ben? 
[00:23:00]  Last night.  It's coming.  Believe me.  Anthony Stockholm.  I'm stockpiling.  What an idiot.  Hold on, go ahead.  The other funny thing, too, about Mark, I don't know if you guys noticed last night, too,  there's a lot of my friends really don't like Mark.  Oh, gee.  Like, he's, like, banned from our ski house and, like, a lot of different things.  And it's great if you need a table with Mark because he clears it right out.  Like, there were a few people just horrified. 
[00:23:30]  And I see my friend Ryan go, oh, God, here he comes.  And he just got up and moved to the other end of the bar when he saw Mark come.  Because, you know.  Screw him.  He doesn't want to be in the presence of greatness.  That's all.  That's his problem.  All right.  Hey, we're going to step aside, Ant.  Yeah.  Hopefully, Marianne can hold on because we've got to get more girls for this crystal night.  Oh, yeah, Marianne, hold on.  Party.  We've got guys coming down with lasers and all sorts of stuff.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  It's going to be a huge party.  It's turning out to be a pretty cool thing. 
[00:24:00]  Marianne.  Yeah.  Hold through the commercials, okay, and we'll talk to you.  Okay, thanks.  We'll go right to you next, all right?  She's going to try out for the party, Anthony.  We'll explain in a minute or two.  Roy.  Also, we've got ratings in Boston, and we'll talk about that in a few minutes, okay?  Right.  One, two, three, four, hit it!  Hold naked girls.  Hold naked girls.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Hold porno.  Hold porno. 
[00:24:30]  It's not good for you.  It's not good for you.  Who else gives you porno and comedy at the same time?  A stupid program called the Opie and Anthony Show.  And let me do it.  W.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  We've got a huge party we're putting together for Tuesday.  Our friends, Crystal Method, stopping by.  I am so psyched for this.  Their CD's coming out Tuesday, and they were just going to come by and say hi. 
[00:25:00]  Then we're like, hey, could you be kind of like a house band for the day?  And then we said, hey, we'll invite some hot girls down here.  Now we've got people involved that are setting up lasers and all sorts of things outside the studio.  It's going to be a cool time.  But we want the ideal girls here, right?  Right.  Yeah, for some reason, yesterday, we're picking girls.  And I'm thinking, just like any other thing we do, we just have to get as many girls down here as we can.  We usually, for some reason in the past, have had a problem getting the girls down here. 
[00:25:30]  So when Opie started turning girls down based on their height, saying, this girl's under five feet tall.  She can't come.  I'm like, what, what, what are you, you're insane.  Then, slowly, I realize, oh my God, this is brilliant.  It's only girls that are perfect for this event.  Yeah.  It's going to be a, we're calling it a pre-20 party.  Yeah, but then all of a sudden girls in their late 20s were calling. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  Off.  We'll go up to, you know, like 24, 25.  Yeah.  As long as they look like they are pre-20.  They got to look a certain way.  They can't, they can't be, well, I don't want to give too much away because we got a couple girls I want to try out.  Right.  You have to act younger, too.  Like, if you're over 25 and you have Down syndrome, it's acceptable.  Yeah.  Let's go to Marianne.  Yeah.  Hi, Marianne.  Hi.  Hi.  You want to be part of the party on Tuesday? 
[00:26:30]  Yes, I do.  Crystal Method party?  Yes, I do.  All right.  Do you have a boyfriend?  No, I don't.  Why are you doing that with your voice?  Why are you doing that with your voice?  Because.  It's almost, I think I know what you're going for.  You're going for sexy, you're coming off as whiny.  No, not at all.  All right.  You know what?  Well, let's give her a shot.  You don't know when she's nervous on the radio.  She doesn't have to talk.  Maybe this is the one that we don't bring in to talk on the air. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  Oh, jeez.  And you've got a stupid cell phone ring.  Well, you know what?  Let's all, hey, hey, hey, we got up on the wrong foot here.  All right.  How tall a gal are you?  All right.  Good.  Ask the question Oprah's going to ask.  Go ahead.  Hello.  How tall are you?  How tall am I?  I'm 5'3".  Yeah.  All right.  You fat?  No, I'm not fat at all.  What do you weigh?  Excuse me?  What do you weigh?  I weigh 120.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  You have a little bit of a butt. 
[00:27:30]  All right.  No, I got a big butt.  Nice.  What do you mean by big butt?  I got a big butt.  What's your nationality?  I'm German, Italian, Swedish, and Irish.  Is your arm asleep, Opie?  No, I don't.  Is your arm asleep?  Can it move?  Hey, you guys said I was too harsh yesterday, so look at this is what we have to deal with now.  I don't know.  Please move your hand to that button.  No, wait.  I still say that maybe there's potential here.  There is no hope here. 
[00:28:00]  She's half retarded.  No.  And you got a big ass.  I like that.  How big is your ass?  My ass?  Why do you guys want to know how big my ass is?  What?  Why do you guys want to know how big my ass is?  Thank you.  Because we're perverts, stupid.  How many girls do we have for this party?  Like four so far?  That's it?  About 30 girls have tried.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Susan.  Susan.  Hello.  Hi, Susan.  How are you?  All right.  You're 20 years old, right?  Yeah.  Opie, we met before. 
[00:28:30]  I just wanted to know if I would be perfect for your party.  Oh.  Who are you?  I met you at Jim Brewer's.  Jim Brewer's?  Who's Jim Brewer?  Jim Brewer.  Oh, Jim Brewer.  Jim Brewer.  All right.  How tall are you?  I'm 5'6".  I'm the seagull girl.  You sound like Madeline Kahn from Blazing Saddles.  You're the what girl?  The seagull girl.  Oh, the seagull girl.  Yeah.  We've all met you.  Yes, you have.  All right.  How tall are you again?  I'm sorry? 
[00:29:00]  How tall are you?  5'6".  Yeah.  Everyone is already saying on the stinky typed it in.  This girl's really hot.  Where have you seen her?  She's the girl.  You've been to a couple of our things, right?  Yes.  She's the girl that called about the...  She was the lifeguard.  Oh, on the beach.  With the seagulls.  Right.  We did a whole bit.  And then we met her and she's very hot.  You had a girlfriend with you the last time we saw you, right?  Yes, I did.  She wasn't a topless bartender, right?  No.  Okay.  This girl...  You pass the audition.  We'll see you Tuesday.  Okay.  I just... 
[00:29:30]  Can I give a little shout out?  Uh-oh.  That could hurt you.  Oh, boy.  You are being ballsy.  You are being ballsy.  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  I don't want to hurt it.  What's the shout out?  I wanted to say hi to all my friends who are listening.  Big fans of the show.  Okay.  That's good enough.  As long as there's no boyfriend.  We don't go for that nonsense.  Oh, no.  No, no.  Get Stinky in here because he wrote on the screen, she's really hot.  Garrett Lightfield.  She's hot.  She's really hot.  Stinky, you remember her, right?  Yeah.  She was at a road show on Long Island. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  You went to Mulcahy's or one of those too, right?  It was actually at the Vanderbilt I went to.  In Vanderbilt.  Okay.  That was the Brewer one?  Oh, no.  Then we saw you at Brewer at wherever.  Whatever.  Like it matters.  All right.  We'll see you Tuesday.  See you Tuesday.  Garrett, how are you?  See you next Tuesday.  I didn't see you very much at Ben's party last night.  I was kind of in the shadows.  Yeah.  There was a little nook.  A little nook, we can call it.  I found it.  To the back of the club. 
[00:30:30]  It was pitch black in there.  There was a table, a little chair or something, a bench.  What was back there?  Tables and a bench.  And a bench chair and a few chairs.  Yankee Cranky area.  Yeah.  That was great.  It looked like a sauna when you opened the door.  When Stinky would come walking out of there.  Trailed by a huge cloud.  That seemed to be where that action was going on.  Everyone was like, I thought the saunas weren't working at this place anymore.  Yeah. 
[00:31:00]  All right.  All right.  One more girl.  I'm going to move on.  Of course.  Corinne.  Oh, hi.  How are you?  Pretty good.  21 years old.  How's everything going?  Good.  No, this is one of the girls from the WOW contest.  Oh.  I'm number 21.  I wore the schoolgirl skirt.  21.  Let's go.  This will make it very easy for us.  Do you want to be part of the Crystal Method party on Tuesday?  Sure.  What time is it?  Corinne, why are you calling?  What time is it? 
[00:31:30]  Corinne, why are you calling?  I'm just calling to say hello because I know today is the last day of the WOW contest.  Well, it's the last day to qualify, yeah.  Oh, okay.  I say we throw her out of the contest for being stupid right now.  Well, let's see what she looks like first.  No, she's beautiful.  I remember her.  But you're just calling to say hi?  Yes, I'm just calling to say hi.  Oh, well, because we're trying to get girls for our Crystal Method party.  Oh, I know.  I can come.  Wow. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, wow.  Really?  All right.  Wow.  Yeah, she's in.  Holy crap.  Hold on.  Hold on the line.  We'll see you Tuesday.  Oh, wait, wait.  I'm running around my apartment naked because it's so hot today.  Oh, where do you live?  She's a dancer.  I remember her whole story, right?  All right, Corinne, you want to party with us Tuesday?  Yes, sure.  With Crystal Method?  Cool.  Hold on the line.  Mm-hmm.  And she's going to do pretty well in the WOW Contest.  Last day to qualify for the WOW Contest.  What's the matter, sweetie? 
[00:32:30]  Oh, my computer is broken.  Marianne.  Yeah?  What's wrong?  Nothing's wrong.  What?  Why are you calling back?  Why am I calling back?  Yeah.  How did I miss you guys?  Oh, my dear sweet Jesus Christ on his cross.  Marianne, you realize you're going to wreck our whole radio show today?  Why is that?  We're done with you.  We talked to you for two minutes.  You had nothing.  You have a big ass.  You're not the type of girl we want at our Crystal Method party, so we're moving on.  So why are you calling back?  Oh, because I think I'm worth it. 
[00:33:00]  Do you have a picture you can send in?  Well, you know what?  I was already on your opening, Anthony, so...  Well, who are you?  I won the, um, whiskey and bikini contest.  What, uh...  All those girls were awful.  I remember.  All those girls were awful.  They were awful.  Yeah, as are you.  Aw.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Stop calling.  Adios.  All right, Anthony, ratings for Boston came in.  More gooder. 
[00:33:30]  More gooder.  More gooder.  Off the hook.  Thank you, Baston.  Yeah, it looks like we're doing quite well in Boston, Anthony.  Bastards came right through for us.  And we could, um...  We could add Boston to the list of cities we're number one in.  Yes.  With the famous demo that matters to this company.  And plenty more.  Men, 18 of 49, went right through the roof again.  Thank you.  Thank you, Boston.  Went way, way up.  So, Boston, thank you so much. 
[00:34:00]  Now, we're number one in New York, Philly, and Boston.  It only took, uh...  How long to get back into Boston and...  We've been there almost a year now, believe it or not.  I know, but I mean, it took three and a half years to get back.  Right.  Christ.  So, thank you, thank you.  Yes.  Thank you.  Also, ratings for Sacramento came in.  Mm-hmm.  Still got some work to do, but we're now up to fourth place, men, 18 of 49.  It was more gooder.  Much more gooder.  Yeah.  We had a really good, uh, ratings trend, uh, ratings book, we should say, in Sacramento as 
[00:34:30]  well.  Yes.  Uh, we got some work to do still, but, uh, we went from, I think, uh, 10th place to  fourth or something like that.  Cool.  Our goal is to be number one, men, 18 of 49, in every city we broadcast in.  Right.  So far, we're doing it in New York.  We've been doing it for over three years now, Philly, and now, uh, Boston has added to that  list as well.  Yeah.  So, thank you, thank you, thank you.  And, uh, what do we get Monday?  Uh, Washington.  Can't wait for those ratings.  There you go.  We'll have to wait and see.  Debbie, what's up?  What up? 
[00:35:00]  What up, sister?  What's father?  Hi.  Nothing much.  I'm chilling.  I wanted to come in for your Crystal Method concert.  Yeah.  For the party.  How dark are you?  Um, I'm kind of caramel type.  Nice.  I came in before.  I met old Dirty a little while ago.  How old are you?  I'm 18.  Yeah.  Nice.  That's what I'm talking about.  Well, I just turned.  Tim, I was up there when I was 17, but.  Yeah.  Even nicer.  And how, uh, how tall are you? 
[00:35:30]  I'm like 5'7", maybe.  5'7", and a half.  Uh-oh.  Don't say 5'8".  No, not 5'8".  All right.  You just make it.  How much you weigh?  Um, probably like 145 or 6, maybe.  All right.  Hold on.  I don't get to do this often.  I got to get out the black chart.  Oh, jeez.  Well, my breast is like a 36D.  My butt is kind of big.  So, whatever.  I'm not pretty, though.  So, I don't even care.  No, I got a different chart for black ladies.  Oh, jeez.  Your breast is...  Well, I'm half white, too.  I'm Irish, Jamaican, um... 
[00:36:00]  If you were 5'7", 5'7", 45, and you're a white girl, you're just...  Look, Ant, she'd be right off...  She'd just be off the chart.  Yeah.  But look on the black chart.  Perfect.  Y'all niggas are crazy.  That's right there.  Perfect.  Y'all niggas are crazy.  How about that?  Coming to the party.  It's nice.  And you don't have a boyfriend or anything?  Well, yeah, I do have a boyfriend.  Uh-oh.  Why?  I mean, he doesn't know about this, though, so it's all right.  I mean, he's not...  He's at work right now.  He's not listening.  And he won't know about this, right?  No, I don't think so. 
[00:36:30]  She might have saved herself.  Yeah.  What do you guys think?  I think so if he doesn't know about it, because he obviously can't come up.  But if he doesn't know about it, I don't care what their situation is.  Married, boyfriend, it's all okay with me.  I'm right.  I never care.  I think we need a little color in our party.  I agree.  It's very white.  Yeah, no doubt.  I'm sick of seeing all these white girls on calling and all that stuff.  Nah, yo.  So are we.  What's up with the white bitches?  Yeah, I don't know, yo.  Black, Spanish girls.  We need everybody here.  Yeah, basically, yo.  All my sisters need to represent for Owen A.  All right, I like Debbie. 
[00:37:00]  We're racially diverse.  Yes.  I like Debbie.  I'll dump on anyone.  Oh, shit.  Yo, all right, yo.  Well, I'm going to see you guys on Tuesday, all right?  All right.  All right.  All right.  Can you see you, bye, Debbie?  One.  One.  One.  One.  Yeah.  All right, we filled our EOE quota.  We're doing good for this party.  Shouldn't have any complaints now.  Right.  What, Jim?  Nah, she's fine, right?  Yes.  It's a nice girl.  Yeah. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  Doc makes a good point here.  That's what I'm talking about.  Hey, Doc, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Pretty good.  Hey, why did you get off the phone with a hot, naked chick running around in their apartment  sounding like she wants to talk to y'all?  Well, because we didn't think it was going to make for good radio, and she'll be down here  Tuesday, and she'll be just as naked for everybody, and we'll be able to, you know...  Well, she'll be naked for you all, but us listeners here, you know...  Doc, we share with you guys all the time.  Video, pictures.  What we see, you guys get to see. 
[00:38:00]  Don't worry about it.  Oh, very good.  Matter of fact, matter of fact, as we go to break here, I should say, because who knows  how long it's going to be up there.  Yeah.  Video and pictures from our Buffalo trip.  Oof.  Steve finally got around to it, and they're up on foundrymusic.com.  Nice.  Foundrymusic.com, if you want to see pictures and video from the T&A with O&A party, I guarantee  they will be off the website within hours.  And you know what?  Just because we announced it, yes. 
[00:38:30]  Those stripper clubs, a lot of stripper clubs, a lot of the clubs were firing girls for not  representing them properly.  What is wrong with you?  Really?  Strip clubs.  Yeah.  How do you fire the girls?  I don't get it.  Wait, some of those girls got fired?  Oh, yeah.  The strip club, all of a sudden, they're embarrassed?  What's wrong with you guys?  Jesus.  Politically correct strip clubs.  It was just backpedaling.  What's an art idea?  Zucchini girl got fired?  I believe she did.  I'm not sure. 
[00:39:00]  I can find out, but if she did, it's a disgrace.  She's one of the sexiest girls there, and they're going to fire her.  That's just...  Hey, why is your stepfather calling?  Did we do anything wrong?  What?  Oh, my God.  Sal.  Yeah?  What's up?  My niece with Lisa.  She must be in a wow contest.  Sal.  That's crazy.  I don't think relatives are eligible.  Yes, they are.  Oh, no relatives eligible? 
[00:39:30]  How big's her rack?  Well, when you see her Saturday, you'll know why.  Yeah?  Yeah.  She got a big rack?  Oh, yeah.  You digging it?  Oh, yeah.  Well, I'll take a look on Saturday, as you say.  I'll take a look on Saturday and see if we can fit her in.  I'm just kidding.  Of course you are, you nut.  Don't forget that box you got to bring out.  What?  What box?  Shirts.  I don't know.  What's her name? 
[00:40:00]  No, of course I'll get you shirts for your party, Sal.  Okay.  All right, Sal.  Wait, Lisa wants to say hello.  Hold on.  Just say hi.  Say hi, Anthony.  Hi, Anthony.  Hi.  How are you?  Fine.  Looking forward to meeting you.  Do you know that we're doing a radio show here for about 20-some-odd cities?  Yes.  I'm listening, yes.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, I'll see you Saturday.  Sounds good, honey.  All right.  Bye-bye. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  See you later.  Bye.  Bye.  Thanks.  Oh, sure thing, Sal.  There's a step on.  I'm taking personal phone calls.  Hey, hold on.  She wants to say hello.  What?  That's funny.  This is going to be insanity.  Saturday.  They got a party going on at my mom's on Saturday.  There's going to be like 100 people there.  Ooh.  And they're gearing up for it, I guess, already.  Mm-hmm.  The party has begun.  Oh, forget about it. 
[00:41:00]  Any more booze flowing over there?  Great.  Personal phone calls.  Hey, you want to say hi to your mom?  Would you bring ice?  Yeah.  Could you bring some ice?  Don't forget the box.  And, uh...  Jesus.  We need cities.  Just heard that.  Can't wait for the party tomorrow.  Insane.  All right.  Let's break, okay?  Roy!  But, Boston, thank you.  The ratings were great.  Yeah, kicked ass for us, man.  Thanks.  We greatly, greatly appreciate that as we go to the F.U. line.  Thanks for calling, and here's the Opie and Anthony F.U. line. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, this f*** you goes out to my idiot, soul-sucking jerk of a boss  for making goddamn jokes making me the f***ing comedian  about my friend shooting himself over the weekend.  Yeah, it should have been you, scumbag jerk.  F*** you.  Next message.  P.S. Colossal f*** you to my white trash neighbor  and his face like a foot wife.  You don't like the fact we called social services on you?  Well, f*** you.  You want to swear in front of your kids?  Fine.  You want to lock your kids out in the yard? 
[00:42:00]  Fine.  You swear in front of my kids?  No f***ing way.  And you, you're f***ing happy.  You cry to your mother all day on the phone?  Well, we hear everything you say.  Yeah, is your sister still f***ing half the school?  One of you people crawl back to whatever f***ing housing project  or trailer park you f***ing crawled out from under and die.  Next message.  Yeah, this one goes out to my ex-wife.  She fought and fought and fought for custody of my son for years and years  and when I finally won, you know what this f***ing bitch does? 
[00:42:30]  She doesn't want to see the f***ing kid anymore.  She gives them to me and signs mother f***ing papers  saying that she'll give them to me if I don't sue her for f***ing child support.  F***ing c***.  You f***ing c***.  You mother f***ing c***.  End of messages.  Let me lick that off.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sex for Sam.  Three.  Three.  Three.  Three.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  A lot of people not happy that we just invited Corinne to the party, Anthony, on Tuesday with Crystal Method. 
[00:43:00]  Uh-oh.  As more ladies call up to try to get invited to the party.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Joe.  Yeah.  Hey, listen.  Not to be a dick and bring the show down or anything,  but didn't I hear you say the other day you didn't want to have any strippers and dancer types on there?  I thought you were looking for your pure and natural types.  Joe, I've got to tell you something.  I'm smart. 
[00:43:30]  She's not a stripper.  Why?  She's a real dancer.  I said no strippers.  Oh, she's a...  But I said you're a dancer.  A dance dancer.  Okay.  I remember the rules.  I misunderstood that, too, though.  No, she can call back and confirm, but she's a real dancer.  All right.  We just want to make sure everything's on the same page here.  Of course it is.  Everything's hunky-dory.  I'm starting to think we shouldn't have let that black girl in, but...  Why?  I don't know.  That booty might have been a little too big. 
[00:44:00]  All right.  Booty.  See, in my fantasy, things aren't perfect.  It doesn't matter about what you want, Jim.  Well, there's maybe once in a while we could all have, like, a little girl come in that we want to see.  Dude, if we let you pick these girls...  You're right.  You're right.  I would...  Believe me.  Everyone would be allowed.  It would look like that bar scene from Star Wars.  That hack joke.  That's all right.  We're all having fun.  Hey, Lisa, what's going on?  Hello?  Lisa.  This is me?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:44:30]  No crap.  Okay.  Hey, Jim, it's Lisa.  You know Lisa?  Hi, Lisa.  I'm not sure if they all know Jim.  You know who I'm talking about?  No, tell me, Lisa.  You know, Lisa from Philadelphia.  That's like a stuff with meeting you.  Ringing any bells?  Would you like, Jim, to bring a box over for you this Saturday?  Hi, Lisa.  No.  Now I'm, like, I'm torn.  I just talked to you the other day.  Why?  You don't...  I know who you are.  I just don't want to say your screen name on the air.  No, you don't.  Yeah, I do.  He's shaking his head side to side. 
[00:45:00]  No.  I am absolutely not shaking my head.  Oh, my gosh.  You am...  I can't say that.  I'll put it this way.  There's a...  I don't want to say your whole name.  There is a decimal point in between the two names in your screen name.  Okay.  I know who you are.  I told you that.  Lisa, why are you calling?  I'm calling because...  You realize we have a radio show to do, right?  Oh, I know.  All right.  So why are you calling?  I know.  Well, I got the impression, because I tuned in a little late, that you were looking for  young-looking girls to come to this thing?  Yes.  Well, that's me. 
[00:45:30]  That's me.  Like, I think maybe I could do that.  Like, I might be...  Like, I might fit your criteria to actually be invited to this party.  Way too cocky.  God.  Way too cocky.  Me.  That's me.  That's me.  I might fit the kind of...  That's me.  That's me.  Sorry, at least I had no control over that.  Keeping all your options open, Jimmy.  No, no, no.  We've never slept together.  I mean that.  Never.  That's me.  You're welcome, Jimmy.  Wow, the girl's not having much luck today.  Cindy, what's up?  It was tough. 
[00:46:00]  Hey, what's up?  Cindy, get us out of this rut of girls that suck.  Yeah, because we've got to move on to the hooker thing, finally.  The hooker thing.  Oh, then you're wasting time with me, then.  No, angels.  It's got to be more exciting.  Cindy.  Yeah.  All right.  You're 20 years old, right?  Uh-huh.  How tall are you?  I'm five feet.  Five feet?  She just fits.  She made it.  You said five feet, Opie.  Yeah.  Don't look at the button.  She just makes it.  Just makes it.  No.  No.  And she wears heels and shoes and stuff.  No.  Dude, you said five feet. 
[00:46:30]  I'll tell you something, though.  What?  Cindy, admit it.  You're not five foot.  No.  No, girl.  The only girls that say they're five feet are the ones that are 4'10 1⁄2 to 4'11".  I'm telling you right now.  No.  Hold on a minute.  Who wants to bet me $100 right now?  What does your license say?  Five feet.  Who wants to bet me $100 right now?  I'll bet you.  $100?  $100?  Yeah, I'll bet you.  This girl will come down.  Where are you right now?  I'm about 40 minutes away from the city.  Are you guys in New York today? 
[00:47:00]  Yes.  I am about 40 minutes from the city.  Can you come in?  I can't.  I can't.  I'm going to an Eminem concert later on.  No.  I mean, there are people out there that will confirm this.  Girls that say they're five foot tall.  My sister does this.  She's not five foot tall.  I'm not.  I'm five feet.  Definitely five feet.  If you were five foot, you would have said I'm 5'1", 5'2".  I'll bet you.  I'll bet you $100.  Maybe she's five feet and she's saying she's five feet.  She's not.  I will bet.  I got $100 and $100.  If I come down there and I'm not five feet, I'll give you $100. 
[00:47:30]  You cannot condemn her because of the lies of others.  You can't condemn this girl.  She may be telling the truth.  And you can't assume that she's lying because of the treachery of others.  All right.  So let's continue.  All right.  Here's the deal.  Yeah.  Officially, she's, you know.  I will believe it.  She passes the height requirement.  That's okay.  But I'm telling you, when Tuesday comes, we're going to bet.  And I guarantee this girl is under five foot tall.  I'm in.  I guarantee it.  I'm in.  No girl ever says they're just five foot.  None.  I'm five feet.  I swear.  All right.  And how tall? 
[00:48:00]  How much do you weigh?  I'm sorry?  110.  What?  110?  Uh-huh.  Okay.  What else do we want to ask her?  Breast size, right?  Size, yes.  36 D.  36 what?  36 D.  Oh, B.  I thought you said D.  I was ready to get a wedding ring.  D.  Did she say D?  B.  Yeah.  D as in Dan?  B as in Big?  Dan.  It's D.  She's saying D, you idiot.  Clear the wires out of your ear.  Oh.  All right.  D.  Ease?  Shut up.  Yeah, I get a lot of flack about that. 
[00:48:30]  What kind of butt do you have?  I really can't brag about my butt.  Oh, no.  Average.  Average.  Oh, Jesus.  No, she's telling her that her ass is right.  Now, what do you mean by average?  It's not huge.  What's the problem with it?  Nothing.  It's not that big, not that small.  Is it dingleberries on it?  Do you got the Asian?  No.  You got the Asian flatness going on?  No, no, definitely not.  Does it look like you sat in a gravel driveway with no pants on?  God, no.  No?  No.  Do you have a boyfriend? 
[00:49:00]  No, hell no.  What will you be wearing Tuesday?  I guess I have to go out and find something little, something to sleep in.  All right.  Something to sleep in.  Very good.  Very good.  What kind of hair do you have?  I have long black hair.  How long?  Oh, no.  Down in the middle of my back.  Middle of the back, Opie.  Mm-hmm.  I'll ask the question.  Does it touch your tailbone?  Does it what?  Does your hair touch your tailbone?  Uh, no.  All right.  No.  Your dog doesn't smell, does it?  What color hair do you have? 
[00:49:30]  I have black hair.  Black hair.  What color eyes?  Brown eyes.  Oof, brown eyes.  That's all right.  What's wrong with you?  Jesus.  Are you meaty down there?  Damn that dominant.  I'm meaty down there.  Oh, thank you, Steve.  Steve is reminding me I'm forgetting one key question.  My God, and we let a couple girls through.  What?  What if that black girl is having that time of the month?  Oh.  No, no, no.  Actually, that was last week, so I'm in the clear.  You're in the clear?  Right.  Yeah, I'm in the clear.  No curse.  And how big are your feet?  My feet?  Six.  I have little feet.  All right.  Cool. 
[00:50:00]  That's good.  I don't like them big-footed girls look like a hobbit.  No mad magic.  What do you do for fun?  What do I do for fun?  I have a motorcycle.  Mm.  You like girls?  Yeah, I have a bike.  What's that?  You like girls?  I wouldn't admit that to anybody.  Oh, wait a minute.  What kind of bike?  I have a ZX6.  Oh, okay.  It's not a Harley?  No, no.  It's a...  That's good, though.  And a lot of people are going to...  No, a lot of people are going to get pissed at me.  I do not like Harley chicks.  Neither do I.  Jap bike chicks are fine. 
[00:50:30]  Harley chicks, oh, God.  They got the flapjacks.  The one earring, like...  Property of chainsaw tattooed on their back.  I like the Harley chicks.  You know what's going to happen?  The way...  It's hard to get girls...  Dude, everyone is calling, by the way, and saying that I'm so right about the five-foot  theory.  Um...  I'm saying Cindy's in.  This girl, I will bet you're 4'11 and, uh, like a quarter.  And if that happens on Tuesday, we're sending you home.  I'll bring $100.  We need one of those medical scale height things. 
[00:51:00]  Yes, we do.  So you could, you know, flip that little metal thing up, rest it on her head.  We need something very, very accurate.  Dude, if the license says five feet, that's accurate.  Because that has to be an accurate description.  No, it doesn't.  They don't measure you.  You just write it down.  You just write it down.  You just jot it down.  On my license, it says I'm like 6'3", I think.  You're not, though.  Because I've always wanted to be taller.  All right.  Cindy, you're in as long as you pass the height thing on Tuesday.  All right.  Um...  All right.  Great. 
[00:51:30]  Be prepared, though.  We're not kidding.  If you're under five foot, we will show you the door.  You got it.  All right.  Hold on.  You got confidence.  Hold on.  We got to get our info.  How many chicks at this party?  Huh?  Well...  Chicks don't show up.  They will be two perfect girls.  That's right.  Debbie.  Chicks don't show up.  Yo, it's Debbie again.  The black girl that called before?  Yeah.  Hi, Debbie.  Yo, I don't think that Cindy should be allowed to come, because regardless if she's short or  not, she says she has a 36D.  I'm 5'7", with a 36D.  She must be like a football player or something.  Debbie, it's good that you called back.  Debbie, what time of the month do you have your cycle? 
[00:52:00]  How?  Um, in the beginning, like the first week.  Why?  What?  Uh, are you over it right now?  Yeah.  Okay.  And it ain't coming back anytime soon?  Not until August.  Good.  Because that's all stanky.  What?  What?  What?  We don't want no girls riding a cotton pony at our party.  Nah.  We don't want no nappy messes.  We don't want no mess.  No, it's not nappy down there. 
[00:52:30]  Be easy, you little blonde head.  We don't want it.  Neo-Nazi German.  We don't want you to look like a Brillo pad after you strip some ketchup out of a pan.  Mine's smoother than a wood floor, so I don't even know what to call you, though.  Oh, now you're talking.  Looks like some fine polished ebony furniture.  Oh, shit.  I'm glad Debbie called back.  No, but I'm serious about that.  I'm feeling good about Debbie.  Debbie, we can't wait to see you Tuesday for the party.  I'm ready.  All right?  I'm ready.  Bye, Debbie.  Yo, bye.  Wait, Norton?  No.  Stop it, Debbie. 
[00:53:00]  Bye, Debbie.  She's got spunk.  Amateurish attempt.  You know what, though?  Oh, Norton.  She gave it a shot.  Any girl with a wood floor is fine.  Lisa, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I'm sorry to bother you again.  Yes.  I never call this show, but, like, I'm not a cocky person.  I didn't mean that to sound cocky in any way, shape, or form.  I probably have, like, I think I was misunderstood by you guys, totally.  Real quick.  You know what?  I could work with her.  Yeah.  She understood she was at fault.  Very good.  All right.  Lisa? 
[00:53:30]  I might have got off on the wrong foot.  It happens.  How tall a gal are you?  I am 5'1".  5'1".  So are you saying that she's 5'0", Opie?  Yeah.  Do you usually...  No, I'm like 5'1".  Yeah, by making her 4'11".  Did you just hear the last caller, and now you're saying you're 5'1", or are you...  No, I swear to God, I'm, like, between 5'1 and 5'2".  Like, I haven't really got measured in a while.  All right, that's...  Okay.  Perfectly acceptable.  And how much you weigh?  I had 93 pounds.  Wow.  93 pounds?  Yeah.  Ugh.  94.  That's too small. 
[00:54:00]  Well, how...  Is it really?  I'm sorry.  Well...  I figured.  How big is the bra size?  Did you want it to be big?  No.  No.  Just...  Yeah.  You've got to be honest, because we're writing all this stuff down, and if it doesn't match  when you come in, we throw you out of the studio.  What do you have?  What do you have?  Oh, okay.  It's, like, a 34A.  The little A's.  I'm too little.  Wow.  I'm too little.  You look like a 14-year-old girl.  Welcome to the party.  I look like a... 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, I look around 16.  What's with the scowl, Hope?  It's okay.  I was just...  I, like, I think you guys are...  That's good.  She could be like the little sister that's hanging out with the big girls.  Stop.  We have a type of girl that we're going for.  Stop.  She's made it.  Stop.  No.  The height's right.  She's not overweight.  I think girls under 100 pounds, that's a little...  What's your hair?  How long's your hair?  How long's your hair?  How long's your hair?  Oh, I don't make it anymore. 
[00:55:00]  Well, how long is it?  I had really, really long hair, and I cut it a week ago.  Well, how long is it?  It's, like, a little above my shoulders.  All right.  That's okay.  Nice.  What color is it?  It's, like, a...  Right now, it's, like, a...  I have reddish highlights in it, but they're, like...  It's brown with, like, golden tints or something.  Yeah.  You're awful.  No, she's not.  I've seen a picture of her.  She's pretty.  You did?  Where?  She's pretty.  She sent you a picture? 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, it's her face.  I never saw her naked or anything, but her face is very...  Do you have a boyfriend?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't like relationships.  I don't want to think about it.  Oh, for sure.  And that's a different part of my life than I'm trying to, like, feel in.  Oh, jeez, I don't even hear this stuff.  Just don't hang up on me.  That's all I have.  I don't have to come to your party.  I was just like...  And when will you be having your time of the month?  I'm sorry?  When will you be having your time of the month?  Oh, I have a...  When?  That's gone. 
[00:56:00]  When?  Actually, I ended it two weeks ago, so I'm pretty good.  I'm good to go on that aspect.  Hey, Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I went to high school with Alisa.  Yeah.  What a fat mess.  Oh, my God.  You should not let her in the contest.  Oh, no, no, no.  Unless you have the biggest bun contest.  Fat.  No party.  She's 93 pounds, you idiot.  Dude, you're thinking of someone else.  She's really not fat.  She didn't photo her.  She's not fat.  I'm going to give Anthony this one.  Oh, you guys want... 
[00:56:30]  That's okay.  I don't have to come.  I just want to...  I didn't want to be...  I'm sure you're a lovely girl, but you're not really fitting the criteria.  You know what, I probably wouldn't...  And you want to know something, to be honest with you.  I'm just all about, like, eventually, like, hanging with Jim, maybe meeting you guys.  But, like, I don't even know who Crystal Method is, if that's who's playing.  I don't even know the band.  I don't know anything.  I just wanted to...  Oh.  I'll hang with you.  I like you.  She's a nice girl.  She had all the wrong answers.  Yeah, I was...  All the wrong answers. 
[00:57:00]  At first, I was like, well, it might be interesting to have her in on the party.  But after a while, no.  She was annoying me over the phone.  I liked her.  Oh, stop it.  I'm telling you, I'm very tolerant.  You have some kind of a sick internet figure with all these girls.  I've never seen her naked.  I've never met...  She's just a nice girl I've talked to.  Yeah.  I'm very lenient with her.  People think I'm mean.  I'm very nice.  I'm a sweetie.  Joe, what's going on?  Happy birthday to me.  Joe, what's up?  Yeah, I get to pick a girl or two, because it is old Jimmy Norton's birthday. 
[00:57:30]  Answer, Joe, you schmuck.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Jay.  Joe.  Joe.  All right, you're gone.  Oh, Joe, he's a lodger.  Nick, what's going on?  Yo, Opie and Anthony and Norton.  How you doing, guys?  All right.  How you doing, fellas?  You're driving me crazy, Opie.  Why?  He is huge.  It's like you're trying to put together a poison or a journey video from the 80s.  This is crazy.  Bring in some hot little girls, too.  What's the problem?  I agree.  We have.  I know.  You want a journey video because you missed Journey. 
[00:58:00]  All right.  Relax.  You can't wait to go to their reunion concert.  I don't think we're getting that outrageous.  I'm sure a lot of these girls are quite lovely.  No.  Martin and Anthony aren't getting outrageous, but you are.  No.  I think Anthony's more with me today than he was yesterday.  I was with you on that last one toward the end.  At the beginning, though, I was kind of like, well, it might be cool.  We just want some fun, good-looking girls.  As long as it don't end up like the Stepford bimbos.  It's kind of like one of our, it's like a fantasy party. 
[00:58:30]  Okay.  Well, I'm with you guys.  All right.  Take care.  Bye.  Yeah, but our, you know, our tastes are very different.  Yep.  So you got to take that into consideration.  And you can't be.  You know, they have to fit the criteria, but there are some things that maybe little details.  What don't you like about the criteria?  No, I'm fine with the criteria.  I'm just saying.  Over five foot isn't asking for much, right?  No.  Hair shorter than the cracker of their butt, that's not asking for too much, right?  No.  No.  So what's the problem?  No problem. 
[00:59:00]  What about the time of the month thing?  I agree with that one.  The height one, I'm not really with, and the hair one, because people can be sexy.  The time of the month, I agree with.  Boyfriend, I agree with.  No offense, Jim, but you have no voice in this.  I know.  I'm just.  Because I see what you find attractive.  I find some very beautiful girls attractive.  Two weeks.  That, ugh, a mess.  Right in.  I'm not that far off.  No, I could go within the guidelines, but there are some girls that are technically fitting  within the guidelines that you would throw out that I might not. 
[00:59:30]  So those we have to conference on.  Like who?  Well, like I said, the last one was good up until the end of her call.  Right.  And then we both agree.  And then it was like, yeah.  But at the beginning of it, you know, it was like, all right, she might be nice to have  around.  That's why we're, I was hanging in there.  Yeah.  I would have just got to put her back on the air after the first time she called.  I don't like this implication that I'll bang anything.  What?  Are you turning over a new leaf for your birthday or something? 
[01:00:00]  Happy birthday to me.  Why don't you inform us?  That's the guy that got a hummer from a man.  Dude.  I'll bang anything.  No, it wasn't intentional.  You know what?  Right.  You didn't know.  You guys, I'm telling you, Lawrence is, Lawrence.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Say it.  I'm just, I'm just saying, she, she looks anorexic.  If she's five feet, I'm six feet now.  So I'm measuring myself like a foot away from me.  And she wears, what did she say her birth size was? 
[01:00:30]  A, 34A.  34A, 5'1", 93 pounds.  So she's flat chested.  You could probably see her ribs.  I mean, she's 93 pounds.  Ribs?  How much for a rib?  For a rib, there's one dollar.  One dollar.  So are you in agreement that there should be a hundred pound weight limit?  Yeah.  That's got to be the minimum.  A hundred pound weight limit and have to be over five foot tall?  That's not asking for much.  Yeah.  A hundred pound weight limit.  A girl comes in 5'2", 105, that's still a small girl. 
[01:01:00]  If somebody's five feet, are you going to let them in if they're like 80 pounds?  No.  So you've got to put a limit on it.  You've got to put it at least at a hundred.  He just did.  This is supposed to be our special party and it's falling apart because these guys are wavering on me.  It's falling apart because we don't have girls for it.  I don't have any say.  Get stinky in here.  How many girls have signed up?  How many girls have made it through our tough...  But dude, 30% of them show up.  Most of them don't show up.  You know that.  I know.  That's what I'm saying.  You took a...  No, look.  How many girls have made it? 
[01:01:30]  How many?  2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.  10 girls?  3 will show up.  Out of...  Look how many, though.  Out of like 30.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  3 will show up.  Well, we're hoping...  We get a lot of numbers, though.  Keep that paper.  Oh no.  Gary, what's up?  Hello, Gary?  Gary.  Maybe line 3 is busted.  Gary!  Maybe it's broke.  He says,  Ope is out of control.  Someone has to take over.  Fine, Ann.  You take over. 
[01:02:00]  No, I don't take over.  Like I said,  I'm fine with the whole thing.  I'll take over.  No.  Know what you're all about.  You're in.  You're in.  I like a big, fat, sloppy ass.  No, I don't like sloppy.  You're right.  But I do stink, though.  I will pick like 80% of them I'd take.  You're in.  You're in.  You're in.  I have AIDS and breast missing.  Ah, come on down.  Come on.  Does your mouth work?  She's needy.  All right, Anthony, when we get back, we're going to talk about the hooker thing.  And Pablo Francisco's coming in today.  Pablo. 
[01:02:30]  He's here?  Why are you laughing?  I'm watching you do something.  What is he doing?  Hmm.  He's doing his own Arnold Lines for Terminator 2 game.  Oh, is he?  Out there for the pinball machine.  Oh, he's playing the pinball machine and doing the own.  He's going, I hate it.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  He's the one that gave us that clip.  All right, we'll get him in here.  We'll do both next.  We'll talk to Pablo Francisco, and we'll talk about how Details has this article about 
[01:03:00]  how it's okay to pay for sex, Anthony.  And like I said, I read a quick paragraph, and it makes complete sense.  All right, we'll get into that in just a bit.  As long as I keep saying it on my screen.  The Opie and Anthony F.U. line is there for you when life sucks.  Sucks to be me.  Call anytime.  2-1-2-8-3-0-3-7-8-5.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Lots going on today.  We're going to get Pablo Francisco in here in a minute or two. 
[01:03:30]  Very funny guy.  Playing rascals at West Orange.  But Brian wants in real fast.  Brian, what's going on, man?  Yeah, I wanted to say, yesterday, you were being really harsh on picking the girls.  Yeah.  But then I remembered these monsters that showed up for the Money Snatch game.  All those girls said they were hot.  That's right.  God, the Money Snatch.  Now Anthony's totally with me.  Ugh, what a bunch of slob.  We thought we were screening those girls nicely, and it was a train wreck in here. 
[01:04:00]  A mess.  Disgusting.  Can I give a shootout?  Now I'm not looking too bad, huh?  You look great.  You're looking good.  All right, go ahead, Brian.  A shootout.  All right, hold on.  Bang, bang, bang.  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.  That's not a shootout.  He was doing the bang, bang game, which is hysterical.  Bang, bang, bang, bang.  All right, let's say hi to Pablo Francisco, huh?  Pablo.  Where is Pablo?  He was playing the Terminator 2 pinball game, doing Arnold voices to it. 
[01:04:30]  I love that game, but we've got to get a new one in here.  I want the Addams Family game.  Why?  That was a good one, man.  That was a really good pinball game.  What do you look like?  There you are.  What's up, Pablo?  I want to know what you look like.  I was looking at you.  You like the pinball game?  Pinball machine is awesome.  It's pretty good.  It's a Mick Jagger one.  You smashed that Mick Jagger one up.  Oh, you were here for that.  I went down to meet you.  Out of order.  Out of order.  Hello, I'm Celine Dion. 
[01:05:00]  You were talking about me, you know, about the creature of me down there.  You know, someone told me it was tamales.  But it's okay.  You know, my head is so big.  If you are having sex with me from behind, I look like you're having sex with a football team mascot.  Because I'm such a big head.  Yeah, the Mr. Madhead.  On the next Babylon 9.  And everything changes your life.  Everything changes.  You know, it changed my life, you know.  I saw the children in the audience that were waving to me.  My life is incredible.  How can something, some stinky, come from something so beautiful? 
[01:05:30]  That noise is very spooky.  There's a song I wrote about it.  That's right.  A duet with Aaron Neville.  I sound like a radio station.  Traffic.  Man, what's up?  What's up?  Thanks for having me back on the show, man. 
[01:06:00]  Everywhere I go.  Cleveland, I called you guys.  You guys hooked me up in there.  Oh, yeah.  Sold out that show.  And then San Fran.  He goes in San Fran.  Yeah.  And your special on, was it Comedy Central?  Comedy Central.  They've been running a million.  A million.  Aaron.  It's great, though.  I mean, that's a really good one.  Once you get a show on Comedy Central, a special, you will be on there for 50 years.  Oh, yeah.  Just keep flowing and back and forth.  They keep playing it.  And now they've come up with a new way to package these things.  They take some of the best segments from people's stand-up and throw them all together. 
[01:06:30]  So you'll see, like, one bit from one comic.  Right.  And then another bit from another comic.  And it's the same things you've seen a thousand times on Comedy Central.  It's the comedy compilation.  That's right.  It's all put together.  And, you know, it's going to be a good thing, you know?  You'll always be alive on Comedy Central.  Always be alive.  You'll never die.  Always tell him the same joke.  Hey, I got your hair.  I look like a lesbian.  Did you see me on Leno?  Over and over. 
[01:07:00]  You didn't see Leno.  No.  I barely.  Where were you on Leno?  I was on there, June 4th.  And, you know, what?  And he says, chin is so big.  Yeah.  It needs a tight clip.  That's how big it is.  I said, don't do business with being a teen because, you know, the way they treat the  people in this.  Did you do well?  I did well.  And then he asked me questions, but he doesn't look at you.  So, what's going on?  Like, he's looking at someone else.  You're me?  Yeah.  I'm looking at someone else.  He looks past you, right?  Yeah.  How's that all about? 
[01:07:30]  That's a little odd.  His little kid was in the green room.  What are those audiences like to play to?  Oh, man, they're all looking at the TV monitor and you're on there.  And I was shaking my body trying to get their attention.  I'm very good.  Paco, Crank, Crick, Crick, I want to hear it, right?  I've heard that's just, like, brutal, though, because I've known a few comics that have done  those shows, and the audience isn't really there to see a comic.  It's, yeah.  You know?  Yeah, they were all there.  They were that star that was on the show with Ashley Judd, but they're like this,  this, you ever watch Attack of the Clones with Star Wars Episode 2? 
[01:08:00]  They make the audience.  I don't know.  Yeah, they don't seem, they go there just, oh, we're going on Leno, I hope there's a  good guest tonight.  Oh, yeah.  You know, it's not like they're going, people going to a comedy club where they're going  to a club or something, and you wind up, sometimes you get a bad audience.  Oh, yeah.  You know what?  They laughed at everything.  Hey, what's going on?  It's good to be here.  All right.  Bob will forget it.  It's crazy.  It's crazy.  They were laughing at all J's and Mono. 
[01:08:30]  So the other day, I went to the store, and I bought a Snickers.  It's crazy.  I hate his monologues.  It had Nugget in it.  It's crazy.  It's crazy.  I just like going back and forth from Lenerman to Leno and watch him do the same...  Oh, the same topics.  Topics.  And a different little take on each one.  But the same exact topics.  It's the news of the day.  Yeah.  At the same time.  You'll be...  I can't do Letterman, but... 
[01:09:00]  So, you know.  What's up, man?  Thanks for having me on the show.  What's going on, man?  What's your...  I remember the last time.  That's Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy Norton.  Who was the guy with the cigar?  Remember the last guy with the cigar?  Who was here?  Who was the big old guy?  Let me tell you something.  I'm going to smack somebody around.  Who was here?  Remember he watched you smash the pinball machine?  Oh, that's Ronnie.  Oh, Ron.  Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez.  It's Jim Norton's birthday today.  Oh, is he...  How old are you?  34.  He's been wishing himself a happy birthday.  Happy birthday to me. 
[01:09:30]  Me.  Happy birthday to you.  34 isn't really like one of those big birthdays.  It's just one of those...  Eh.  It's there.  It's not like the 30.  35 is one.  40.  Things like that.  34 is a dull, boring birthday we shouldn't even pay attention to.  Great day to blow your brains all over the wall.  No, that's...  All right.  Save that for 40.  Let's eat.  Peter, what's up?  Oh, hey, what's up?  I just want to know if Frank Caliendo can do the Pacino impression.  I really love when he does that.  Oh, yeah.  So he thinks I'm Frank Caliendo. 
[01:10:00]  Frank Caliendo does...  It was...  Who is that?  It's Pablo Francesco.  Hello.  Every morning I wake up and I eat some chorizo con huevos.  Pouya.  See, the thing is, Frank was doing the movie, guys.  So I called him and said, stop doing it.  I did it first.  And then now.  You know, now.  So everyone thinks I'm Frank Caliendo.  So call me Pablo Caliendo.  Are you ready this summer for Pablo Caliendo?  Everywhere.  Scarface.  Okay.  You got to say, we're going to try it again.  But right now it's time for another...  Okay, every morning I eat chorizo and that's it, okay? 
[01:10:30]  It's Latin, Al Pacino, Pouva.  That's it.  We want Dennis Hopper?  Come on, man.  Somewhere there's a guy out there, huh?  Going out there talking about eating Cuban food like chorizo, huh?  Yeah, I ain't bad.  I'm Pablo Caliendo.  Pablo Francis.  Pablo Caliendo.  But he's coming next week.  He's a funny guy.  He's at Rascals, too.  We're going to be at Rascals.  He's going to be there, too, with you? 
[01:11:00]  No, no.  He's going to be, like, in the next week.  Yeah, because he's a good friend of ours, too.  So rock and roll.  All right.  We've got to get into this hooker thing.  You're hanging, of course.  Let's get into the hookers.  We've got a lot of things going on here.  The hooker thing?  Well, there's a really good article in details we're going to start right now.  Also, we're inviting girls to our party with Crystal Method on Tuesday.  Crystal Method?  Okay.  And we're looking for really hot girls to party with us on Tuesday.  We're going to party.  But they have to call us up and we ask them a lot of questions to see if they're...  It's very strict guidelines for these girls to get in. 
[01:11:30]  Some people think too strict.  Really?  For them to get in because...  But we just remembered about what happened with the Money Snatch contest.  The Money Snatch, like almost all the girls, all but I think one...  And they all said they were hot.  ...were slobs.  They're listening.  One was pretty hot.  There was a couple of hot ones.  I won't say who it is.  Which one was the hot one?  Okay.  I'm not going to say.  Hot ladies.  She knows who she is.  Hot ladies.  She knows who she is.  The other ones were...  Oh, God.  I got blown off because the intern C-blocked me.  C-blocked you? 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, she's like, that's my friend.  Don't go out with my friend.  Oh, the one, the intern you never love.  And it's not good.  I'm like, I'm going to push her into an open elevator shaft.  I was so aggravated that she C-blocked me.  You were trying to pick up one of the girls from the Money Snatch contest.  Which one?  She was very pretty.  Which one?  Which one was pretty?  I'm not going to say anything.  They were all lovely ladies, but I don't mean lovely in LA.  I think I know which one you mean.  She was a cute girl.  There was one that was cute.  I was looking at her the whole time.  The other ones, and some of them even went past just being a mess. 
[01:12:30]  And they were like subhuman.  She blew me up.  Subhuman.  That big, fat, annoying one.  The one that cheated.  We all have a Money Snatch game, and this bitch cheated.  I don't know how you can cheat.  How do you...  Yeah, exactly.  The rules were real simple.  They're simple.  You grab as much money as you can in the allotted time, but you have to hold it in a  place that ain't your hands, that ain't your mouth, that ain't your nose, your ears.  Yeah.  You've got to hold it right in the front. 
[01:13:00]  I can do it if you put me in there.  Celine Dion can do it.  You're fucking about it.  Walk away with a Brinks truck in there.  This girl was holding her legs together.  Subhuman.  And using knees and thighs.  And the other girls are like, hey, what's the deal?  This chick's cheating.  We took the pain and, you know, used the receptacle the way we're supposed to, and this girl's  cheating.  Subhuman.  And then she started crying.  I wasn't cheating.  Oh, you're a mess. 
[01:13:30]  You're nude.  You're disgusting, and you have money falling out of you.  They're paying for it.  Hey, you spend it.  You got some change.  And then she cried because she had enough money to buy her, what, daughter a birthday gift?  She goes, oh, because then we had to make some kind of a concession tour, which I didn't  want to do, that she could keep the money that she did have, because, I don't know, because  she was ruled the winner by, we jumped the gun there, and she starts crying, going, now  I can pay for my daughter's birthday party.  Do her a better favor. 
[01:14:00]  Hit her over the head with a shovel, and kill her, so she doesn't have to grow up with  you as a mother.  God, you're being harsh.  Now I'm totally into the conditions we're putting on.  She wasn't that bad, was she?  Awful.  She was awful?  Horrid.  She was so fat, you want her kid killed?  You're an awful man.  She was subhuman.  That's a little harsh, man.  Definitely subhuman.  Hey, Diane, what's up?  What's going on?  You're 20 years old?  Yeah.  Okay.  That's me.  Have you been in bars already?  What?  Have you been in bars already?  Yeah, I have.  Not legally, but I have. 
[01:14:30]  Where are you from?  Worcester.  Worcester.  Yeah.  The big city.  Yeah, the big city of Worcester.  Worcester.  Are you going to college there?  No, I don't start until January.  I'm actually going to college in Boston.  So you're a local Worcester girl?  Yep.  Oh, boy.  Well, you know something?  Oh, we did a lot of signings out in Worcester, and occasionally a hot-looking girl came by.  Yeah.  Good stuff.  I remember that.  Good stuff.  And you want to come down for the party Tuesday? 
[01:15:00]  I do.  All right.  Are you ready?  I am ready.  This is how it goes, Pablo.  Okay.  How tall a gal are you, Diane?  I am 5'5".  You're 5'5"?  Yes.  Diane, how much do you weigh?  I weigh 150.  Someone's playing a deadly game.  You're having a stroke on the left side?  Donuts.  Hey, do you like donuts and curry?  No.  I'm a little chunky, but I'm not, like, gross.  A little chunky?  A little bit.  I'm sick.  I wouldn't even...  You're built like a square.  What are you talking about? 
[01:15:30]  Do you like a light bulb?  No.  Skinny, you know, thin body, but...  Do you have a big ass?  Um, not really, no.  A little bit.  All right.  How big...  I have a nice ass.  How big are the breasts?  Do black guys like to go out with you?  36 feet.  C's.  Not even the double D's where you can say that's where the weight's going.  She's only 20.  She's already 150 pounds.  Who's your boyfriend?  Is he white or black?  I don't have a boyfriend.  Exactly.  Of course not.  You know how fast girls your age start putting on weight?  No.  By Tuesday, you're going to be 270.  No, I would not. 
[01:16:00]  No?  I think we need to send you down the road of rejection.  Oh.  Oh, man.  Oh, that was...  There she goes.  I can't believe you waited that long.  It's my birthday!  Axed.  Gone.  That's how it works, though.  She dropped her like a hot crack pipe.  Now, a lot of people get mad when we do that, but you know what?  I'm sure she's a lovely girl, but we're looking for a special girl for this party, right?  Right.  Right.  This party has to resemble...  Baywatch?  Well, no, because we're not going that angle. 
[01:16:30]  It's more of a sleepover pajama party type thing, but the Crystal Method's going to be playing.  It's going to be a party atmosphere.  We want these girls, though, to have a certain look like girls at a slumber party.  And you and I don't want to look bad.  Right.  You know?  We're showing off for our first Crystal Method.  We can't be having girls in there that are like, oh, boy, why do we even do this?  Why are we spending for these guys?  And they have slobs.  We're going to have lasers and lights and all sorts of stuff.  Lasers and laser beams and machines and drum machines. 
[01:17:00]  It's going to be good.  These are going to be good.  Is it going to look like the slumber party in Greece?  Remember that?  Yeah, that's what I'm kind of looking for, but only without old girls.  Senator G?  Okay.  Only without...  What the hell was her name?  Rizzo.  Rizzo?  Yeah, it was nice watching a 45-year-old woman trying to play a high school girl.  That was really...  I don't know what she was.  She looked at her.  She was smoking cigarettes, remember?  And they kind of make a...  Brush her, brush her, brush her.  It's in your light pen.  And...  Come on, you just can't walk out of a drive-in movie. 
[01:17:30]  Sandy.  Come on, Sandy.  Come on, drive out.  Come on, you.  Stranded at the drive-in.  Branded of food.  And the eye caught a guy right in the nuts.  Oh, can't...  Who?  Come on.  Trivolution.  Little hot dogs and wieners on the big old big screen, jumping into a bun.  They don't understand, you know?  And Travolta said, hey, Sandy, how come there's only one?  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Let me tell you why there's one.  Summer Labyrinth had me a blast. 
[01:18:00]  Okay.  You ever see Indian people who karaoke and they do that?  They sing Grease?  Come on, this car is automatic.  It's systematic.  Say, it's not so.  Denny Zucco going out with a chick with one breast?  Cool dropout. 
[01:18:30]  And you must hit the nine-second delay or four.  Four in a second.  We're back.  All right, you want another girl to try out here, Ann?  Tea dropout.  What's up?  Subhuman girl.  Why don't you buy a mirror and hold it up?  Oh, man.  Hey, Megan.  Yeah.  You want to be part of our party Tuesday?  I would, yes. 
[01:19:00]  All right, you got a boyfriend?  No.  All right.  When was your time of the month?  Probably like...  The girls in New York are synced up.  They're all synced up in this city.  Every girl had their time two weeks ago, it seems.  Okay.  How tall a gal are you?  Megan, how tall?  I'm 5'8".  5'8".  Yeah.  Stop it, you set the...  What is it, 5? 
[01:19:30]  It was 5...  All right, how much do you weigh?  Like 140.  Oh, 140.  She's 5'8".  Good.  I'm a 38B.  And you have both of them.  You're a what?  38.  Definitely have both of them.  38B?  Yeah.  38B?  38B?  That's kind of a big back for a small...  Are you a slimmer?  You're going on late.  I used to play...  I played softball, like, years ago.  You felt, like, awful.  That's what it is. 
[01:20:00]  Softball.  What do you guys think?  Well, everybody always thinks stuff about the girls that play softball.  38B?  Does your back look like a cobra ready to strike?  Hey!  No?  No.  Do you like Bruce Lee?  Only on Sunday.  Yeah.  Good old cobra back on the phone.  Hunches her back and spreads out her arms like a flying squirrel.  That's right.  Hey!  No?  Okay.  I'm just checking.  No.  That's okay.  All right.  How big are your feet?  Uh-oh.  I'm wearing, like, a size 9.  Oh, big feet. 
[01:20:30]  Big, clunky girl.  You're not, though!  But you can wear a big Chuck E. Cheese head and then walk around and look at their big feet.  Oh, God.  Even those big footprints everywhere, like, big foot.  Megan, it's not looking good so far.  What do you do for a living?  Are you a roofer?  Do you want knuckles?  What do you...  Sorry, what?  How long is your hair?  It's shoulder length.  Shoulder length.  What color?  It's blonde.  So she's a tall blonde girl.  Yeah, with big feet and a long back and small breasts.  Cobra woman. 
[01:21:00]  My breasts are not small.  They're bees.  They're bees.  No way.  They're not small.  What are they?  They're the eight B?  Yes.  That's wide and flat.  No, it's not.  I'm not knocking it.  It's great if you want to build casinos, but it's bad for a bank.  Oh, boy.  Thanks, guys.  Are you ready?  That was Norton.  I think, um...  I'm still hanging in there.  Barely.  Do you have a boyfriend?  No.  Oh, you said that.  Okay, what do you...  How's your ass look?  Is it for you?  I have a nice ass.  Well, I've been told I have a nice ass. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah?  So, I mean, I don't know how to judge that.  It's not big.  It fits in the pants.  She's 20.  She might just be going through an awkward phase.  Maybe brothers just walk...  Hey, man, you got a nice booty.  Your brother's like a big booty.  You know what it is?  Yeah.  With no skin.  Put some hot sauce.  You know what I'm saying?  Hell.  Your brother says it's good.  Watch him.  What?  You hang up on a couple of really good ones.  I have a nice ass.  What has actually got you waiting?  You guys said I was too hard.  I'm sorry.  No, no, no.  We're playing your way now.  No, no. 
[01:22:00]  No, no.  We play your way now.  We're playing your way now.  We play your way now.  We're over there...  You said...  Now, I would have had you pegged to have hung up on this girl already.  I would have hung up as soon as she said 5A.  All right.  No.  You set the parameters at 5A.  5A was acceptable.  As soon as you hear 38B...  Right.  Then you got to...  You got to go.  Your fingers should have been moving.  Yeah.  I forgot to tell you guys one last thing.  Okay.  Uh-oh.  Oh, she got us. 
[01:22:30]  I knew that was happening.  No, I said uh-oh.  Those are last words.  She didn't say anything.  That's the gag.  She goes, oh, one more thing.  Flying squirrel click.  Yeah.  Leah.  Oh, we could have set up the band on her back.  Leah.  No?  Good.  Set up the band on her back.  If everyone's on ecstasy, she'll look just right.  Everybody play on the house.  Leah.  Leah.  Hello.  Hi.  What's up, Leah?  Hi, how are you?  Hi.  Say what you got to say.  You're on the air.  I want to say that you guys are so freaking lethal. 
[01:23:00]  Why?  What's the problem?  We have an agenda here.  We have a criteria and the girls have to fit it or else we bail.  We're sure all the girls are lovely ladies, but we have a special girl in mind.  We don't get to do this often.  Oh, well, you know, what can you do?  You guys are freaking lethal, though.  You guys are lethal.  That's not true.  If you're too fat, you get booted off a plane.  If you're not hot enough, you don't come to the Crystal Method party.  That's the way it is.  You know what?  Definitely.  One of our listeners reminded us, you know what? 
[01:23:30]  I was feeling a little bad about myself, but he brought up a good point about the girls  from the Money Snatch.  Money Snatch.  Two words.  We must remember them.  Money Snatch.  Money Snatch.  All those girls swore they were hot and ready for this contest.  And we were very disappointed.  We were like, hey, what are you looking at?  Oh, I'm hot.  And that's all they asked.  That's all they had to say.  I'm hot.  We invited them.  Brutal.  What are you guys looking for?  We'll just keep listening.  It's very obvious.  Money Snatch.  All right.  All right.  All right.  We'll do one more girl here, and then we've got to take a break. 
[01:24:00]  And if we don't get into this hooker thing today, then our listeners are going to hang  us up.  Veena.  Hey, guys.  Oh, Veena.  Hey, Veena.  You're 23.  Yes, I am, baby.  All right.  And how tall a gal are ye?  5'4".  5'4", Opie.  Fits right in.  How much do I weigh?  Yes.  125.  125.  Okay.  All right.  36 full C.  Just got them done last year.  You got them done? 
[01:24:30]  You have implants?  Yeah.  Are you a stripper?  No, but I could be if I wanted to.  Okay.  Boyfriend?  Not at all.  Hair?  What kind of hair?  What kind of hair?  Curly black hair.  Curly black hair.  Mm-hmm.  And what about on your head?  Green eyes.  Yes.  So far, so good.  A nice tan going because of the summer.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  I'll be your caramel delight.  Yeah.  Not a Vos tan, is it?  Excuse me?  All dark and dry. 
[01:25:00]  My torso couldn't be that long.  No, I'm cute.  What will you be wearing?  What would you like?  Is it a pool party?  What kind of party?  I could come in as a silver bullet.  Crystal method is just going to be spinning for four hours or whatever.  I'll wear my silver cat suit.  Silver cat suit.  All right.  And is it your time of month?  There you go.  No, not at all.  When was it?  About a week and a half ago, two weeks.  Wow.  Two weeks.  They're all synced up in New York. 
[01:25:30]  I'm not going on in two weeks.  All right.  Vena is in.  All right, baby.  Yeah, I think you're in.  Go ahead.  See, she passed the audition.  Are we missing any questions?  Pablo, you want to ask her a question?  Yeah, you know, good dentist.  My filling came out of my tooth.  It just fell out of your tooth.  It fell out of my tooth.  Look at that thing, man.  Where the hell?  Where are you going?  You're a dentist.  I don't know, man.  I went down on the corner.  Yo, kill your mama.  You just lost his brain.  My filling came out.  I paid like a thousand bucks for this thing.  Oh, it's going to be a real good show tonight.  How you doing? 
[01:26:00]  Good to be.  Good to be.  It's not like an Indian guy just coming into the country.  How you doing?  Good to be.  All right.  Good to be.  Good to be.  Good to be.  Good to be.  Good to be.  Good to be.  Good to be.  Good to be.  All right.  Vena, you're in.  You are in.  Hold on.  And Stinky will get your information.  We'll see you.  All right, boys.  All right.  There goes Vena.  All right.  We got another girl.  That was easy.  Bam, bam, bam.  Piece of cake.  All right.  Pablo Francisco hanging with us today.

[01:28:30]  It was never on cart.  It's your tune.  You should have it out in your wallet.  I know.  He was proud of the tune.  Yeah.  I've got to find it.  Have you seen my tune?  It's in his tune.  He was looking for the HIV.  I can't find it.  Oh, man.  You can't find it.  What's the deal, man?  Oh, Rick.  Oh, it's your time.  This was it.  This was your shot.  That's right.  Down to number one, is that an HIV song?  Oh, my God.  And down to number two.  Why wouldn't you have it just out?

A Muppet Joe tonight.  Our blood is really tainted.  We know we're gonna die.  So why should we use condoms?  I just bagged me three more guys.  What?  I think I got it from Animal.  It's time to get things started.  So loose can't tell I farted. 
[01:30:00]  Why don't we get things started?  I'm the most sensational.  Homosexual.  Infectional.  We love anal.  This is what we call a Muppet show.  Wow.  This brings tears to your eyes, you know.  Isn't that great?  What do you think?  It's hilarious.  We probably got it from Animal.  Yeah.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Play the charm.  Yes.  One pecker.  Yes.  Here's the one we've been playing all week about the AIDS puppet there. 
[01:30:30]  AIDS puppet.  Oh, Rick.  What happened?  What happened to that, Rick?  Oh, boy.  We gotta go.  One AIDS virus.  Two.  Why don't we just go find it on CD somewhere?  Yay.  Did he download it from a service?  No, I thought I could do it.  I thought he had to go to, like, one of those Napster-type things.  One AIDS virus.  Ha, ha.  Two infected.  Oh, oh, oh.  I don't understand why it's not just laying around. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, oh, oh.  It's a hot tune that we've been playing all week.  Cookie monster.  It's not like cookies.  All right, when they find it, we'll play it for Pablo Francisco playing Rascals in West Orange.  That's right.  Thanks.  Come on down.  It's going to be a good show.  And his tooth will be fixed.  All right, Details Magazine, Anthony.  Dude, what are you going to do?  I said that during commercials.  What a drag.  Dude, what are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  Oh, the Knicks O&A.  What are you going to do?  That blows them.  Yeah, I know, man.  No pizza tonight. 
[01:31:30]  Okay, Details Magazine.  Ready to hit the newsstands, Anthony.  Why it's okay to pay for sex.  Why it's okay.  Why it's okay.  So they're saying it's a good thing.  You take blockbuster car.  It says, in a perfect relationship, the man never strays.  But who's perfect?  The next best thing to being faithful, a guy who admits to hiring hookers.  Yeah, right.  So, all right.  Come on, you like me?  Come on.  Listen, I got to take cash up front before anything happens.  Come on, let's do something. 
[01:32:00]  Come on, just bend over.  Come on.  I don't know who your friend is.  You pay for one.  I'm going to leave.  No, no, no, no.  Leave.  Come back here.  There will be no dead air on this show today.  All right.  Come on.  Let me see your cookie.  Chocolate chip cookie.  Chocolate chip.  I don't know who your friend is.  You pay for one.  No pause.  No subtle pause.  You pay for one.  What are you talking about?  You pay for one client.  Now you got two guys in here.  He's just going to what? 
[01:32:30]  Solo.  Pause.  Sometimes pause is good.  Sometimes.  I'm out of here.  No, it's all right.  And to my friend that I was talking to, I apologize.  The intern yanked the cord out.  So, I'm sorry you got hung up on.  Personal message.  I'm so aggravated right now.  I wish I had AIDS so I could bite somebody.  What happened to you?  We're trying to do a radio show.  You're flirting with chicks.  No, no.  I'm not flirting.  It was just another call.  His teeth are falling out.  He just yanked the thing out.  And then Sands said,  Hey, cord.  Oh, God. 
[01:33:00]  Wait, what happened?  Why would you touch anything?  Why?  Who are you talking to?  He was on the phone with somebody.  Very important phone call.  And Francine, I guess.  Why would you touch anything?  Pulled the cord out of the phone.  Why would you do that?  If I saw you on the phone, I would never think, oh, and tug.  It would never occur to me to tug a cord out.  Get Francine in here.  She pulled the cord out of the phone.  What?  And he hits the paper bag.  Francine.  Why are you cursing now? 
[01:33:30]  Grab that mic.  Yeah.  Okay.  Why did you pull the cord out of Jimmy's phone?  I didn't pull the cord.  I pushed a button.  Why?  I was trying to put someone on hold.  And it was the button that Jimmy was on, huh?  I think so.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, she's leaving now.  She's taking off.  Good.  She just came in with her little shorts. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  And I press the button.  I press the button.  I press the button.  What are you talking about, Willis?  You know where the HIV song is, Ben, now that you're back in the studio?  Wow.  We have an HIV song?  We should be celebrating birthdays during the week, I just realized.  My birthday today, by the way.  People are just wandering in and out.  Everyone's lost.  Ben's just wandering.  People's teeth are missing.  Ben's wandering around.  Hookers are okay.  What's the deal?  Which song?  Oh, the...  Which song?  HIV song. 
[01:34:30]  Puppets.  Get in.  Tainted blood.  HIV song.  HIV song.  You know the one we were playing all week?  Tainted blood.  All right, Ben's now looking for it, now that he's back working for the show.  Muppets.  I'd say a dump.  Uh-huh.  Take a steamer.  Nice.  Have a man.  Nice to go with Boston dump.  Boston dump.  Cheese and alcohol.  Cheese and alcohol.  Good God.  Ben's just wandering around throwing his hands up.  Oh, he just threw something at... 
[01:35:00]  Why are you throwing stuff at Jim?  No, I mean, it bounced off of the mic and almost hit me.  Nice herky-jerky dump.  What did he throw?  He might need to play that.  Andrew W.K.'s CD.  He threw Andrew W.K.'s CD.  And alcohol.  To getting hung up.  Why are you throwing his CD?  He went to your party last night.  Tainted blood.  Oh, my God.  And this guy's not shutting up because his tooth is missing.  And his tooth.  Jesus.  What the eff is going on?  Tainted blood.  Pears head.  And subhumans.  What's wrong now?  What?  Doug U.L. 
[01:35:30]  What?  Doug U.L.  Doug U.L. is here?  Doug U.L.  Yeah, but he's a cool guy.  Doug U.L.  This is the freakiest show I've ever been party to.  What happened?  I'll start with Sal.  You're going to blame Sal?  Anthony.  Make sure you bring your boxes.  Ben, how many hours sleep did you have?  Four.  Four.  Four hours sleep Ben's working on.  All right, I got the Christopher Street song. 
[01:36:00]  Okay.  So now we can back up ten minutes, all right?  Let's play that.  Do you remember what we were talking about?  HIV and then hookers.  Tainted blood.  Oh, Jesus.  Headhead subhuman and a tooth that came out.  Not the hookers.  Tainted blood.  Well, yeah, okay.  No, HIV Muppet.  HIV Muppet Show.  For South Africa.  For South Africa.  I'm not going to use that Muppet in America.  I'm not going to use it in America.  He's humoring me today in a weird way.  I don't know why. 
[01:36:30]  Tainted blood.  Make him drink ice-cold water.  Oh, no, no, no.  Yes.  Yeah.  Come on.  Will you do that for us?  No, I can't.  Just put it right in where the filling came out?  No.  I got an idea.  It feels like a Lego.  Someone get a nice wad of tinfoil for Paul Francisco.  Oh, God.  He's missing a crown to begin with.  Here, just take a sip of this ice-cold water.  Let's see if it works.  It'll probably activate it.  Then I'm probably doing it.  Can't do the show. 
[01:37:00]  Don't be doing the show.  Put it right on it.  You're fine.  It won't hurt.  Nothing?  It's okay.  It's all right now.  It's nothing?  No, it's the...  I put the crown already over it to protect it,  so I'm holding the crown up with...  All right.  Ben, what are you talking about?  Protection.  It's a version of the song.  What are you looking for?  It was right there.  Oh.  Well, thank you, Ben.  It's all right.  So pop it in.  I got it.  I got another copy already.  I'm on the CD player.  Usually I get pissed off, but this is a hilarious scene. 
[01:37:30]  Ben is sweating profusely.  He doesn't want to be here.  You all right?  I'm fine.  What's up, Ben?  HIV.  Wait.  Ten minutes.  Not in Africa.  All right.  Ready, Ant?  Yeah.  Here's the Christopher Street song about the puppet.  The AIDS puppet.  We're all gang, stick and see, in our race. 
[01:38:00]  T-cells low, we've got the HIV.  It's a great way to lose some weight on our way to Christopher Street.  Dead in days, lesions all over my face.  How do my A's and grab some A-D-D?  You can watch my life wither away on our way to Christopher Street. 
[01:38:30]  On our way to Christopher Street.  On our way to Christopher Street.  Why is Rick comforting Jim Norton?  What the F is going on here today?  Rick is comforting Norton?  He's out of his mind right now.  Why are you out of your mind?  We've still got a radio show to do.  You're right.  I took it out on Francine.  She is retarded, but something else happened with tickets on Ticketmaster that I've had on  my website for a month, and Ticketmaster isn't selling them because the promoter said, 
[01:39:00]  yeah, go through Ticketmaster.  So I put a link on Ticketmaster.  Oh, that's not how you get them.  So people have been clicking, looking for my name, and they haven't been getting tickets  for a month.  He always has a problem with his show.  Oh, there really is.  There's always a problem with your shows.  Could you get Francine back in here?  We've got to get everyone back on the same page so we can continue the radio show.  Same page?  We've got to get them on the same book first.  Same page?  Tainted bleu.  I needed those 20 minutes ago. 
[01:39:30]  That's why I was pissed that you weren't here.  I had to go to the bathroom.  I understand.  Now you're all excited.  That's right.  Ben just sounds like Ricky Lake in here.  Now it's all making sense.  I was frustrated because Ben wasn't here because when we need something, Ben knows what I need,  right?  Right.  He wasn't here because he was too busy taking his Boston dump that Jim had to point out in  between Pablo Francisco's dude falling out and the rest, okay?  When Francine came in, I wanted to play some of her theme songs and stuff. 
[01:40:00]  But I couldn't find him because I couldn't find Ben.  And out of nowhere, Ben just pokes me really hard on the back, all excited, and puts this  stuff into the machine, which I needed the last time Francine came into the studio.  I called from down the hall saying I was going to take a dump.  And so they knew where I was.  Alcohol and cheese.  20 cities know that you would go on duty 10 minutes ago.  Look, he hates that.  Alcohol and cheese.  He hates it.  What kind of?  It was alcohol and cheese.  All right.  So now he's very excited.  So now he can play these because we want to play this as Francine walks into the studio. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  She's a dissent, a dope, and a moron.  She never learned to add to and to.  She says that she's in college, but she can't tie her shoe.  It's going A to intern, Francine.  Alcohol.  That's her.  Little song.  She has a little song.  Little song.  I thought Harry Connick Jr. was going to get in there.  All right.  Francine.  Solve your problem with Francine.  You can't be calling her a retard behind her back. 
[01:41:00]  I would say that to her.  There's no problem with Francine.  The call is dead.  The person didn't call back.  That's the end of it.  You're really annoying.  It's more than a happy family.  You shouldn't have pressed the button, I guess.  You know what they teach you on radio if you go to school for this and stuff?  You know when you go through that door that you went through?  I know.  You have to leave your problems out there.  You're right.  I know you're right.  But every time you walk out that door, you get a new problem.  I can't help it.  I can't help it.  I'm not even doing shtick. 
[01:41:30]  I apologize.  It drives me nuts.  Jim Norton will leave the studio during commercials.  He goes to the computer and the phone.  And something on either one of those will always cause him such distress that he comes in just yelling and pissed off at someone on the phone or someone on the computer.  For a month.  The guy said, I had a little link.  I did it myself.  Href equals Steve, when he was not in an alcoholic stupor, could teach me Hotmail or whatever it's called. 
[01:42:00]  HTML.  HTML Hotmail.  Yeah.  HTML.  And I did it myself.  And people have been going to Ticketmaster email me for a month.  All right.  Get Steve in here from foundrymusic.com.  I don't think he'd appreciate that you're calling him an alcoholic.  I'm not calling him an alcoholic.  I'm not.  Old flea belly.  And Francine, stay close, because you got a...  He's calling you an alcoholic.  No, I didn't.  No, I said, when I'm not in an alcoholic stupor, yeah.  Right.  There you go.  Right.  Now, alcohol and I are going to have a long time.  You've helped him out with some code.  Part ways comfortably. 
[01:42:30]  And why are they calling you cheap?  I never said you were cheap.  Ben said that you're cheap.  That's so not true.  You of all people shouldn't be calling me cheap.  I said that he gets mad when he calls him cheap.  This all started in Philadelphia.  Well, nobody likes being cheap.  Oh, Ben called him cheap.  Frankie called him cheap.  And then he got mad, so he called him cheap all weekend.  He gets mad.  But didn't he grab you by your shirt collar?  Steve, like, grabbed you by your shirt collar and almost threw you?  Yeah.  Are you cheap?  No, not even remotely. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, all right.  He gets mad.  Ben likes antagonizing people.  He likes just fishing for a reaction.  Yeah, thank you.  Yeah.  Sky's blue, water's wet.  Ben likes antagonizing people.  Ben, you're not in a drunken stupor today.  No.  You're fine.  I'm fine.  No, no, no.  No, no.  The alcohol thing is going to have to get rectified.  This whole no stomach thing is really great.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Pablo, he doesn't really have a stomach.  What's that?  What are you talking about?  He had a staple.  I had it removed.  Yeah.  He was a staple.  Were you fat?  Yeah.  About 110 pounds heavier.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  How much pounds did you lose? 
[01:43:30]  110 pounds.  Oh, my God.  Hence the 110 pounds heavier.  Way to go, Chad.  That's great.  Look how obnoxious he is.  That's great.  Steve really is mean.  Yeah.  I like Steve.  How far does the scar go?  Is it all the way all over to your chest?  Yeah, I'll show you.  Wow.  It's covered with hair.  It's covered with hair.  It looks like a vag.  It's great, man.  Congratulations.  Yeah, but it's just the alcohol just affects you a lot differently when you don't have a stomach.  To hold it and break down the alcohol.  How big is your stomach?  Probably about that big right now. 
[01:44:00]  The size of a little walnut.  But there's no liquid goes right through.  So this alcohol isn't stopping anywhere.  It's going straight to my liver, which has finally just occurred to me.  Might not be the best thing for me to be doing.  Sure it is.  Sure it is.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  Wow.  That's good.  All right.  August 10th.  You don't have to go to Ticketmaster if you want to see me at the Count Basie Theater because  you can't get tickets there.  All right.  Francine looks upset.  Francine, grab the mic.  Are you okay, Francine?  Why?  Did she have an important call at Disconnected?  I don't blame you for being upset.  That really is aggravating, isn't it?  Oh, God, no. 
[01:44:30]  You all right, Francine?  She's pissed.  I'm sorry, Norton.  I know, and I like Francine.  Stick up for yourself.  He called you retarded.  I don't care.  What?  I didn't write the theme song, a ditz and a dope and a moron with a soundbite.  I like Francine.  Exactly.  And I get you coffee every day.  I like you.  You know I like you.  It just happened to this.  I'm not even plugging it.  Who cares?  August 10th.  Do you want that girl to call back and then we can get back on track here?  Dude, this is what is annoying me.  This Ticketmaster screw-up had nothing to do with anything. 
[01:45:00]  It's just amazing.  You're like Eddie Vedder.  Pearl Jam with the Ticketmaster.  No!  I want Ticketmaster.  Oh.  It's easy.  But no, no.  I've got to give out a number.  It's for August 10th.  It's 842-9000-732 area code.  I apologize, but it's supposed to be on my website and I don't think it is.  But we're trying to promote Pablo Francisco.  It's all right, man.  I'm August 10th.  I need a dentist.  All right.  842-9000.  All right.  Get back to the phones.  They await.  Pablo is tonight and tomorrow.  There she goes.  Francine there.  Come on.  Check it out.  Francine.  Francine. 
[01:45:30]  Francine.  Francine.  Francine.  Francine.  Francine.  Francine.  Francine.  Ah!  The angry intern.  Who's that, Bart Simpson?  Doesn't that sound like Bart?  It's Francine.  Ah!  That's Francine.  That's some yell?  That was a yell from hell.  Subhuman.  Tainted blood.  No teeth.  HIV songs.  What's wrong with your computer, Ant?  I just, by...  The moon beyond.  By just...  It just sucks, doesn't it? 
[01:46:00]  It's a habit now.  It's totally not working.  It is down.  Why is it cutting?  The computer is down.  You don't know what you're going to do.  The kids hit it with all the kids.  Why, did Francine hit a button while you were in the middle of it?  What are you doing?  He's really annoyed at that computer.  There you go.  That...  There we go.  Holy smoke.  All the time I come here, you guys destroy something.  Fix it!  I think I know the problem.  You guys don't know how to handle your alcohol. 
[01:46:30]  They destroyed it.  Oh, yeah, you guys...  Pablo, you want something to drink?  There we go.  Hey, you broke my computer!  Oh, look.  It rebooted.  It's actually booting.  Hilarious.  Perhaps I fixed it.  What's all this?  Circuitry.  Hey, man, what's the deal?  You guys are always destroying things.  Expensive pinball machines.  You want a D key?  Thanks.  Put that in my...  It looks like my tooth filling.  D.  As in, don't call Ticketmaster.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:47:00]  There we go.  All right.  Is everyone cool now?  Andrew, I feel much better because this has been pissing me off since we got here.  I knew it was coming because I could see him hitting the keys harder.  I was just...  I could see it.  I'm like, he's going to break it.  I'm a nut with computers.  I have to have one on in front of me at all times.  Jim, you all right?  Yeah, no, no.  You're back to normal?  I'm good, man.  Thank you.  I was really annoyed.  Steve, I'm fine.  You're fine?  So you all right with the cheap comment?  Yeah.  All right.  Come on.  We all know the cheap one. 
[01:47:30]  My tooth, my filling's back in, but it needs glue.  But I'm cool.  Oh, okay.  I can't believe you just smashed...  You guys smashed a lot of things.  They break everything.  It's the only way.  Ben, do you have to evacuate again?  Yeah.  All right.  Ask him what kind of dump it was.  I don't know.  Maybe we should just set up a little bowl right there.  It's not happening.  Coffee can or something?  I also destroyed my copy of the story about the hookers that we're never going to get to.  Would you like mine? 
[01:48:00]  Because I have no...  All right, here.  Go get a...  Make another copy of the story.  Make another copy here.  Here's the...  Here's the details magazine.  Oh, he really smashed that computer.  Oh, jeez.  I didn't think you were going to do it.  Windows did not detect a mouse or keyboard.  I can't even click on do not show this message in the future.  Just tell it not to.  Hit you with a job in Buffalo.  Despite what you guys may think, this is a good show.  Ben publicizing his dump.  Classic.  Norton passed.  Always funny. 
[01:48:30]  Pablo Francisco.  F-ing hilarious.  Can I use any more exclamation points?  I don't think so.  All right.  Do you have faxes?  Facsimile.  Facsimile.  Broken keyboard.  Tinted bleu.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I've heard college stations more organized and professional than this.  It's such a mess.  Yeah.  I got to agree with you on that one.  Oh, my God, dude.  Later.  Rick, you don't have any problems, right?  Rick's okay?  Rick is great.  No, I did all this damn work today.  We're never going to get to any of it.  Like what?  I sat through Robin Williams again. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, yes.  Oh, yeah.  We're trying to determine if he's funny or not.  Have you seen his show?  Yeah.  I haven't seen his show.  The HBO show?  Yeah.  Have you seen it?  I thought it, I saw most of it.  Was it decent?  No, blows.  I don't like the guy.  I don't think he's funny at all.  Just what?  Did he go a whole hour or a half hour?  He went an hour.  It was an hour.  An hour and 40, I think.  Wow.  Look, a spring.  Boing, boing.  And everyone laughs.  And it's like, they're just laughing because it's Robin Williams and they feel they're supposed to. 
[01:49:30]  That's a good Robin.  But he doesn't have anything.  I know what we can do.  The Pantera thing real fast.  Can we?  I do.  Is that Rick's all in a tizzy?  My enter key doesn't work.  See, I can't believe the keyboard doesn't work.  Stop hitting.  They broke the keyboard.  Half of it's gone and I'm trying to hit enter to get the message off my screen.  They broke the keyboard.  That message is taunting you and reminding you of your behavior.  Come to the show tonight.  Stinky, what are you doing today?  I'm looking for a new keyboard. 
[01:50:00]  Why?  No, don't worry about it.  The computer's broke.  I was ready to put the keyboard right through the monitor.  Did you see how them keys were flying back and forth, up and down?  Ben is so happy right now.  Yeah.  There's a bunch of...  All right.  Very good.  All right.  Are we ever getting to that story?  Yeah.  We got to make more copies because you destroyed yours.  I know.  I got all torn up underneath the key.  What are you laughing at, Ben?  Those keys were flying.  They look like teeth, man.  The rapids. 
[01:50:30]  What is that?  What are those blue things?  Viagra?  What is that?  I don't know.  They're pushing the keyboard thing.  It's like...  What a mess.  It's like that little space between your cheek and gum.  What a goddamn mess.  All right.  Can we play more Pantera-filled clips?  Yeah.  Let's do that.  Do you listen to Pantera?  Yeah, I listen to Pan...  Yeah, or something like that.  Like that?  You don't know who Pantera is.  I know who Pantera is.  It's a heavy super metal band.  It's like anthrax.  Heavy super metal band. 
[01:51:00]  Heavy super heavy metal band.  Yeah, you know.  It's one of those...  Well, we talked to him, and he was very wasted.  Totally, yeah.  He admitted that he was on methadone, but we think it might have been the big H.  Heroin?  We believe so, but we can't prove it.  He admitted it was methadone.  Methadone.  That's when you're coming off a big H.  Yeah.  And we got some fun stuff out of him.  So here's...  What?  Look at Anthony daintily trying to put it back together.  No, I'm putting the keys back in the broken part of the keyboard. 
[01:51:30]  Right on top of the Viagra.  I'm just dropping them in.  I'm not trying to fake...  This is beyond repair.  Please.  So here's Phil from Pantera talking about marijuana.  Marijuana.  It's a quick clip.  But marijuana is one of those things that the majority of America has smoked.  Yeah.  Dope.  Right.  You know?  Yeah.  You know, I mean...  It's the...  Bigger... 
[01:52:00]  Scarier...  Drugs that horrify people, you know?  You're a fussy fussy fussy fussy fussy fussy.  Jesus, he gone.  Oh, my God.  They're all stars.  Here's more, Phil.  I've lived a hardcore f***ing life, man.  Right.  Right.  I hear that.  And I am a...  You've led a...  Thorough, thorough examiner of... 
[01:52:30]  Things that most people wouldn't get near, you know, with a 10-foot pole, you know?  And that's why I call myself, and people like myself, lifers, man.  You know?  You always have that flair in you that is going to make you live on the edge every day of your life.  So gone. 
[01:53:00]  It sounds like the beginning of 2010.  Oh, my God.  There are stars.  It's all stars.  It's all stars.  And a little life, man.  You tell us, man.  Speaking of space, I wish I could get into a time machine and go back in a few hours.  I know.  I wish I could go to August 10th in Red Bank at the Count Basie Theater. 
[01:53:30]  Get those from Ticket Masters.  All right.  Here's more, Phil.  No, no Ticket Masters.  Here's more, Phil.  When I was 15 years old, I burned my parents' house down.  What the hell?  Seven days ago, I wrecked my brand-new truck going 65 miles an hour.  I can't believe that, guys.  You guys are really...  Who's talking to that guy?  We were.  We were, yeah.  What was this at a bar?  It was at Oz.  Oz Fest.  Oz Fest.  Yeah. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  That guy's shot.  Here's another clip.  I feel like I'm too old for going to sleep or something.  Man, I'm like...  I just...  I feel like one walking St. Vitus record, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, because...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  What record, man?  Dude, he could be the coolest man on the face of the earth.  Totally.  He was like, cool.  He was walking around like a... 
[01:54:30]  Drug fiend rocker.  The dude from Weekend at Bernie's.  No joke.  No joke.  They were leading him around.  He looked like he was just a corpse.  But there was a weird charisma to him, man.  People really...  It's not just because...  Like, I didn't know who he was, but I was like, you knew he was somebody.  There's something cool.  When you hang and talk like Stephen Wright, people think you're cool.  Yeah.  I'm going to give you heroin.  Big A, man.  Was he like Weekend at Bernie's?  Like, was it a pinball mission?  Bing, bing.  He was a mess. 
[01:55:00]  But he was aware, though.  He wasn't stupid at all.  No, I wouldn't call him stupid.  No.  At all.  I heard heroin's better than sex.  That's what I hear.  Here's him talking about the side effects of methadone.  All right.  Yes, it has some side effects, but, you know, comparatively to being absolutely illegal,  being absolutely destitute, being absolutely at the mercy of this horrific drug. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  It makes a whole lot more sense.  I almost said the S-word there.  It really did.  I did.  So are you on this methadone right now?  Yes, I am.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Talking so slow, it's like R2-D2 and CP3 are right in front of Jabba's place, and that 
[01:56:00]  thing comes out of that ball.  R2-D2 and...  Is that a good analogy?  Good analogy?  R2-D2, okay.  R2-D2, okay.  R2-D2.  R2-D2.  R2-D2.  There's no off button on him.  I'm sorry, man.  I'm on methadone.  Do I need methadone?  Are you on the methadone?  What's up, man?  She's falling out from all the drugs, you know what I'm saying?  I'm doing the Hawaiian punch candy.  Hey, Josh.  Hawaiian punch candy knocking out the two fillings, you know what I'm saying?  Josh, what's up? 
[01:56:30]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hi, Angel.  Yes, you're on.  Dad, I was outside talking to you, Ant, at OzFest.  Uh-huh.  What was that?  Outside, and I showed you the picture that Phil signed.  Yeah.  And he just, when he was signing it, all he did was just make a line.  He didn't even sign the picture.  Oh, when he signs autographs?  Yeah, he just draws a straight line.  A straight line?  On something.  That's his autograph.  Phil.  Dude, you can draw me an equator.  Dude, I'm just going to put a line on this piece of paper. 
[01:57:00]  We got two more clips to play.  Here's Phil talking about his birthday.  How old a guy are you, man?  What?  How old a guy?  How old is what?  Oh, what are you?  How old am I?  I just turned 34 June 30th.  Happy birthday.  Shut up.  Shut up.  I don't think he thought you were being sincere. 
[01:57:30]  You think?  Yeah.  Someone else just turned 34?  Oh, little Jimmy Norton.  Happy birthday, Jim.  Happy birthday to me.  Happy birthday to me.  You know what I want to hear for my birthday?  All right, Jim.  Now it's your birthday, remember?  On the face.  One more clip from Phil.  All right.  And I have a rottweiler dog named Dracula. 
[01:58:00]  And me and him walk the woods.  And I have two white sand beaches.  What state, man?  Louisiana.  Louisiana?  Yes.  I was born and raised in New Orleans.  That explains the lot.  Yeah, man.  Mardi Gras.  You can't hear Mardi Gras.  He doesn't sound Southern, though, Matty.  No.  He's in Pennsylvania for some reason.  Western Pennsylvania.  He's in the Cajun food.  All right.  We're going to step aside here. 
[01:58:30]  We really have to get to that story.  Yeah.  It's about hookers?  I see Andrea is 18 years old.  She wants to be at our party.  All right.  So we should talk to her.  Quick, Francine.  Hang up on her.  And Pablo Francisco.  What's up?  He says Dracula?  All Spanish.  You know what he said?  That guy said something about Dracula.  That guy walked with Dracula in the woods, man.  And, you know, quackity.  All Spanish DJs sound like Dracula. 
[01:59:00]  Hola.  How are you?  There's a lot of traffic this morning.  See, see, see, see, see.  That is the first thing you've said today that I've understood.  You're going to say, oh, what you're talking about?  Tinted blood?  Pears head?  Sub, sub, sub, sub, subhuman?  See?  It's coming out scattered.  Break another keyboard.  What did you do?  Then my tooth came out.  All right.  You're picking up my keys, Jimmy?  Oh.  He's showing me the O key.  I'm going, oh. 
[01:59:30]  They're collector's items.  Yeah.  Oh, I'd love to sell Ant's keys on eBay.  There you go.  All right.  We want to thank Pablo Francisco for stopping in.  We're going to be at Rathbool, man.  In West Orange all weekend.  Very funny guy.  And we got Guy Torre and Frank Colleando coming in.  All right.  Very good.  And we're going to regroup and get to something next.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  The management of this radio station brings you these relaxing sounds of nature.  Now, Opie and Anthony present the sound of someone eating glass. 
[02:00:00]  What is it?  Holy Jesus.  I'm going to watch this.  Cringe Radio.  The Opie and Anthony show.  I feel so alive for the very first time.  I won't shut up.  Holy Jesus Christ.  I feel so alive.  Yes.  And I won't shut up.  Stop for two seconds.  Jesus.  Shut up. 
[02:00:30]  And I think I can fly.  I think I can fly.  Look, I'm flying.  Look, I'm flying now.  Holy mother of Jesus Christ on the cross.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes, we're back.  We're on.  We're back.  What a good time to breathe.  Ben brought up a great point.  Yes.  The guests of the Opie and Anthony show will not be drinking Red Bull before they come  into the studio.  Oh, my God.  Ever again. 
[02:01:00]  Ever again.  Hey, we all love the Red Bull, man.  But not before you're supposed to do a radio show.  Last time I saw anyone talking like that, we had just bought a couple of eight balls  of Coke, and there was none left.  I felt like I was in that Star Trek episode where...  No Coke.  Star Trek episode.  Where you and I were like in normal motion.  Everything around us was really, really fast.  Right.  AIDS song.  HIV. 
[02:01:30]  Tainted blood.  HIV.  AIDS song.  Tainted blood.  Well, we're moving on to hookers.  Hookers.  Hookers and AIDS.  AIDS.  Subhuman.  Little midget girl coming to the party.  I had it.  I had...  I apologized to my keyboard.  I had to smash something.  You know something?  I blame the sun today.  It went away.  I think the sun decided it doesn't want to shine anymore. 
[02:02:00]  Here in New York, I swear, I looked at the clock, and it says 5, uh...  50, whatever.  50, a quarter to 6.  It's been like this for, what, a half hour?  It is pitch dark outside our windows right now.  Dark as night.  Dark.  Dark as night.  Dark as night.  Black.  Black as the night.  Night.  HIV.  Holy Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus Christ.  Savior.  Lord Savior.  On the cross.  Jesus.  Look, I'm hanging on the cross.  I'm hanging on the cross.  Look, I'm hanging on the cross.  AIDS.  AIDS. 
[02:02:30]  HIV.  Puppets.  Scott, what's up?  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, Pablo's got the timing of Limo Anthony.  Look, I've seen his act and stuff, and he's funny.  He really is hilarious.  I don't, I, I, you know...  Between losing a crown and three or four Red Bulls before he got...  Maybe the Red Bull.  That was a lethal combination for today's show.  I swear to God, if we were talking and you went like, so, Opie, between so and Opie,  so, so, so, your pants, so, your pants, so, so, so, so, your pants, so, so, so, so, the 
[02:03:00]  cartoon character that walked around with a blimp.  Look, I'm flying, I'm flying.  HIV.  HIV.  Puppets.  Puppets.  Girls.  Party.  Crystal meth.  Crystal meth.  What?  What?  Who?  AIDS song.  AIDS song.  Come and play.  Everything's A-OK.  I'm gay.  Christopher Shreve.  What?  Oh, I'm exhausted.  I'm exhausted, and I smashed my keyboard, because I swear, if it wasn't a keyboard, my  head would have went through with a monitor to please, please put me out of my misery. 
[02:03:30]  I haven't laughed that hard a long time, because you can see, you can see the frustration  on everyone's faces, and we didn't know how to stop it.  Did you see what I was doing?  My computer wouldn't work, which is even worse, because normally I will just look at  the computer screen and type away.  You were looking straight ahead like an abuse victim.  Um, I swear, I was, I was looking at the phone bank, which is, nothing's happening there.  I was staring at it.  Oh, there was a lot happening on the phone bank.  Oh, my God.  I read a couple of the instant feedbacks. 
[02:04:00]  Could be the most brutal, brutal instant feedbacks we've ever had.  Even over Dustin Diamond.  Dustin Diamond, Diamond, Diamond in the rough.  Oh, did you hear that thunder?  Yeah.  I am.  Thunder, thunder, Sunday, Sunday.  Wow.  Okay.  Are we back?  Yes, we're back.  I noticed you, you know something, Oph?  You pulled a very good strategic move. 
[02:04:30]  Yes, I did.  First of all, we did not get back to the hooker story, because we never, ever, ever would have  gotten through it.  And I like to the, all right, we'd like to thank Pablo.  We'd like to thank Pablo.  There's no turning back at that point.  Now, you know our show.  Anybody that's listening to the show knows, you come in here, you're here until we leave.  When a guest comes in, they're here until seven.  It was impossible.  You wrote that at 510, Rick? 
[02:05:00]  Wrap it up with Pablo at 510.  It took me a half hour to figure out how to do it.  Wrap, wrap, wrap it up.  Wrap it up and I'll take it.  Fabulous Thunderbirds.  That's why I hate calling in, because I always know that, all of a sudden, all right, Jim,  we're here.  We've got to get you, we've got to let you go.  We've got to wrap it up with you.  That's why I hate doing a phone in.  We're going to let you go.  I'm going to burn you out.  Oh, my God.  Well, I'll call in.  He'll be like, all right, call in to Mark.  I want to ask you something.  I'll call in.  All right, Jim, we're here.  We've got to let you go.  We know you've got to get on a thing.  I'm like, no, I don't.  Yes, you do.  Like I said, I've seen the guys act. 
[02:05:30]  It's very funny.  And you know what?  I will defend him.  He was in here.  Defense, defend me.  Four or five months ago.  He was beyond hilarious.  But I don't know what happened today with the Red Bull.  That wasn't the real Pablo.  He was trying too hard.  It might have had something to do with the crown falling out.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Am I wrong here?  All right.  Nope.  Wow. 
[02:06:00]  Okay.  Tainted love.  Tainted blood.  Tainted blood.  Tainted blood.  Love.  Muppets.  Muppets.  Look, I'm a Muppet.  I got the AIDS.  I'm going there.  What?  All right.  Ben is back to being bored.  He was enjoying himself for a little while.  Now you're back to being...  Ben likes the weird, uncomfortable situations.  Yeah.  Just laughs his ass off.  Just over there with his newly cleansed bowels.  Ben is a very private person when it comes to him.  His doing things like that. 
[02:06:30]  His dumping.  He frustratedly had to tell all the city.  All right.  Look.  I was on the toilet.  He had to tell.  On the churlet.  Do you have a pain in your stomach?  Sit on the churlet.  Yes, Ben.  I ran to the back and I called down here and gave answer phone.  I said, listen.  I'm going to be down here for a good ten minutes.  Right.  All right.  And I explained it all.  Everyone relayed the message and we needed all that fucking stuff for the show.  Stinky new. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  And the CD was right there on top of the pile.  CD right there.  Right there on the pile.  We're past the CD thing.  Okay.  All right.  Anthony, what a goddamn day, man.  I actually thought it was going to be a game to see how many other audio clips we could  play while he was still here.  Oh, my God.  I know.  We went there.  It's like, is there more Phil?  Can you play more Phil?  And Phil's clips have silence all over it.  And he was filling the gap. 
[02:07:30]  Phil's just like, well, I'd go.  I burnt down my parents' house when I was...  Burnt down the house.  Burnt down the house.  Burnt down the house.  Burning down the house.  Live.  Here he is.  Phil from Ventura.  Burning down.  Fourteen years old.  That's why I went into a state of panic when we couldn't find a song.  Dude, he was singing over Rick's song parody.  And you are a smartass because you left his mic on during it.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:08:00]  You should know by now.  I love being annoyed and it just makes me...  Oh, it was...  It makes me kick.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Your gut is awful.  Look at that.  Happy birthday, birthday pal.  Oh, God.  Happy birthday to me.  I have an eight-month-old baby in my stomach for my birthday.  You don't even have a hint of a muscle.  He just pulled his shirt up.  You are so doughy.  I'm a fat pig, selfish fool.  I will never claim to be in that great of shape, 
[02:08:30]  but at least I have hints of muscle.  I don't have any.  Those Pringles from yesterday went right to you.  Oh, they're awful.  Believe me.  That's great.  I don't just write things down and say,  oh, that would be funny to say.  I just do them and I'm like, ugh.  I really have stood there and pinched it until there were fingerprints in it.  Pinching that.  Yeah.  Can't get it out of my head now.  My poor keyboard.  I was so frustrated I smashed my keyboard.  And I saw you, I was trying to egg you on because I saw your fingers hitting it 
[02:09:00]  and I know what's next.  I'm like, yeah, you got to, you know.  I was just over and over again typing, shut up, shut up, shut up.  My side hurts.  Now I can improv all day.  Oh.  All right, bro.  Mark's right.  Pablo, last time with the Jackie Chan stuff that he was doing, it was very funny.  The Arnold stuff was funny.  All right, it's just a different day.  This time it was the Red Bull.  It was a different day today.  Red Bull.  Okay, the hooker story next. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Look at the time.  Ah, we suck.  It's really dark out, man.  I know Ben's pointing a storm thing.  I know, Ben.  What's the storm thing?  Storm's coming.  See that thing?  That tells us if a storm's coming.  It's a little tele-type thing.  Ben likes to look at that.  I like to look out the window to see if a storm's coming.  Ben's like, storm's coming. 
[02:10:00]  I saw it ticking on the paper coming out of the machine.  Look at the window.  All right.  Thanks for calling, and here's the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Yeah, I want to send a big **** out to the New York Times for writing an article  all about how we're planning to attack Iraq and what we're actually going to do to attack them.  You know, I know those ****ers are stupid, but I'm pretty sure those ****ers can read.  Nice head deeks.  Next message.  Hi, this is a big **** you to the guy in the red van. 
[02:10:30]  Side swiped my car in the Gowanus in Brooklyn yesterday, and then sped away before I ****ing  got his whole plate number.  Listen, you ****.  I'll recognize your van.  I'll recognize your goddamn Pennsylvania plates.  If I see you again, I'm going to cut you off.  I'm going to pull you over.  I've got a bat in the car with your name on it.  I'll bash your skull in, you ****er.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to give a big **** you out to the IRS and the scum **** that stole my 
[02:11:00]  social security number and made my ****ing life a living hell for the last 10 goddamn years.  Scumbag!  I hope you ****ing die with your ****ing 18 kids.  Scumbag!  **** you!  End of messages.  Opie and Anthony's Inappropriate Moments, number 32, the Inappropriate Birthday Party.  Happy birthday to you.  Eat my ****.  Suck my ****.  Happy birthday to you. 
[02:11:30]  Stick the bottle in your ****.  Happy birthday, 10-year-old nieces.  Big ****.  Big ****.  Hey!  Happy birthday to you.  Stick it in her.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ben's a potty mouth in commercials, but the funny thing is you say the F word and look  and see the mics are on and then stop talking after the curse goes out.  Yeah. 
[02:12:00]  Was there a curse there?  I don't think you heard it.  What did you say?  You had to take another effing cup?  Because I spilled my coffee during the commercial break all over the place.  Coffee and pizza?  No wonder you were exploding in the toilet.  Right.  Oh, mighty.  What's the matter?  Is there any X-lax available?  Coffee and pizza.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Debacle.  Using that term very loosely today. 
[02:12:30]  I'm going to get Ben to take solid dumps.  I'm not trying to be weird, but I'm thinking they're like an inch long and three inches wide.  Like little rock'em, sock'em robot heads.  There's a lot of cheese on that pizza, too.  It's going to be a mess later.  Beed the sweat on his forehead.  Is there a karate fight in that stall?  No.  Ben just wants to go home. 
[02:13:00]  That's hilarious.  You were the one that messed up this whole show and you don't even know it by having a party last night.  Trying to wipe jerky, jerky movements paper all over the stall.  Look, Ben is not amused in the least. 
[02:13:30]  Let's move on.  Hooker's door.  Hooker's door.  Bowel move on.  Oh, my God.  What's the deal?  Oh, my God.  Pablo.  What's the deal, man?  It was the pinball machine.  What kind of shrugs are you doing today?  It was a pinball machine.  It was like throwing those little program things.  Get out.  Painted blood.  Pablo, was it the Red Bull? 
[02:14:00]  It was the Red Bull in the tooth, man.  Was it?  Yeah, it was something, man.  Did you notice that you didn't stop talking at all from the time you came in until the time you left?  Like, there wasn't even an opening to jump in to start a subject.  I don't even think we ever introduced them.  It was that dead time or something, man.  It was that Muppet song.  Like you said, you want a Jackie Chan?  Here we go.  You got the broccoli?  Come on. 
[02:14:30]  You got the beef?  You got the broccoli?  Okay.  Okay, we're done.  Okay.  Yo, mama, you're so fat, Buddha rubs her stomach for good luck.  Don't you pray, keep her?  Get my tooth in Red Bull.  What the hell?  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Pablo, we defended you.  We said that you're a really funny guy.  Thanks, man.  And you're at Rascals in West Orange all week.  Go see the show.  Go see the show.  Go see the show.  Just don't drink any more Red Bull before you hit the stage tonight. 
[02:15:00]  Red Bull.  Red Bull.  Tainted blood.  Red Bull.  Tainted blood.  Okay, it's raining out here, guys, but thank you so much.  All right.  All right, Pablo.  Thank you.  All right.  Don't drink no more keyboards.  Pablo.  Peace.  Yeah.  Oh.  Perhaps it was the Red Bull.  Yeah.  Okay.  Red Bull in tainted blood.  Jesus. 
[02:15:30]  Wow.  There's some sick...  Was that your stomach rumbling?  All right.  There's the thunder outside.  Oh.  Driving up for another evacuation.  That was the cheese working its way through Ben.  Ben, I thought cheese didn't sit well with you.  Wow.  He's so annoyed that we're talking about his bowel movements. 
[02:16:00]  Why?  Dude, you're my favorite people.  I don't care if you take horrible, loud thumps.  He's percolating.  Hey, there's something you don't see in a toilet every day.  Old Chewbacca colon.  It's hilarious.  Did he clean up the mess you made, the coffee and the keyboard and the computer and stuff?  Pretty close.  Okay.  One.  Coffee, computer, keyboard.  Shut up! 
[02:16:30]  Shut up!  Shut up.  Arnold telling me to shut up.  Quiet.  All right.  Yeah.  Okay.  Hope you don't have to dump out.  Not you.  Not you.  All right.  Andrea.  Andrea.  Hello.  Hi.  What's up, Andrea?  Not much.  Where are you calling from?  I'm calling from Euclid.  It's outside of Cleveland.  Yuck.  Hmm.  And you want to come to our party Tuesday with Crystal Method? 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, me and my sister.  Ooh, a sister act.  How old's the sister?  Sisters the same age.  We're twins.  Twin 18-year-old sisters.  Uh-huh.  In the Cleveland area.  Are you lying?  No.  All right.  What do you both look like?  Um, I'm 5'7".  She's a little bit shorter than me.  Okay.  Um, we both weigh about 110 pounds.  Okay.  And I don't know her exact size of, uh, her bras, but I'm, uh, 36 feet. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  And she's around the same, I would assume.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Okay.  Uh, are you, are you synced up on your, uh, female-like cycles?  Yeah.  Um, about three days ago.  So, it's over.  All right.  It's over.  That's good.  I guess, uh, us Cleveland girls are in sync with New York, so.  No, it's a little different for Cleveland girls, right?  Is it really over, or is there still some dust in the flu?  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's over.  Could you do a split on a white shag rug and not cause a ruckus? 
[02:18:00]  Yes.  I don't know if I could do the split, though.  Not that.  All right.  All right.  Hair?  Yeah.  Hair?  Um, mine's brown.  Um, but it's dyed red.  Uh-huh.  And, um, hers is like a light, like, dirty blonde.  Uh-huh.  And how long is the hair?  Um, mine's past my shoulders, and hers is a little bit below her ears.  Opie, now don't jump to any conclusions here. 
[02:18:30]  A little below her ears, so it's a cute little bob cut?  Yeah.  Aw, cute little bob cut on an 18-year-old twin girl, Opie.  Keep your hands down.  Yeah.  I'm fine so far.  All right.  And how big are your shoes?  How big are my shoes?  Yeah.  Um, seven and a half.  All right.  Uh, boyfriends?  Uh, I have one, and she has one.  I don't really know if she'd consider him her boyfriend, though.  Okay.  Are your boyfriends going to be joining you?  No.  They're staying home. 
[02:19:00]  Good.  Okay.  Goes against the boyfriend rule, though.  No, the boyfriend, we don't want boyfriends here.  Yeah, I don't care if they have one.  And, Opie, with the twin thing, you gotta, uh, some, you know, you gotta give them a little,  a little slack here.  Yeah, my sister really wanted to go.  She's at work right now, and she called me up to call you guys.  Yeah.  To get us to go.  Twin 18-year-old sisters.  I'd say they're in.  Are you considered cute and stuff?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:19:30]  Well, why don't you have a boyfriend?  I have a boyfriend.  I've had the same boyfriend for about four years now.  Are you bored with them at all?  No.  And what will you be wearing?  Um, it all really depends on you guys.  We picked out two outfits that we thought were kind of cute and that we wanted to bring  with us, but it depends on whether you guys want naughty or nice.  Naughty.  What do you think?  One naughty, one nice.  One naughty, one nice?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  Good idea.  But, like, sexy, cute, nice, right?  Oh, yeah.  Like, one of them, um, is like an old, like, fashion nightie that, like, stops right 
[02:20:00]  before, like, the knees.  You girls, all right, you know what?  You girls are so in, it's not even funny.  We'll see you Tuesday, okay?  All right.  Come on down.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  Hold on the line, though, okay?  All right.  All right.  I think we'll take care of that, hopefully, if he's, uh, if he's into the show today.  Vito?  Yo.  What's up, Vito?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Sugar Bear, what's up?  Hi, sweetness.  Now, repeat after me very, very slowly, guys, okay? 
[02:20:30]  Yes.  All right.  Details Magazine.  Oh, yeah.  Details Magazine.  We were getting right to that.  Now, see, y'all had already moved on, you know, with the delay and everything.  I didn't know you were talking to the little chick.  She sounded kind of hot.  Yeah, she was hot.  Twins.  Yeah, they're going to be at our party Tuesday with Crystal Method.  All right.  Cool.  Cool.  Punch it out.  Thank you, Vito.  Bye, sweet angel.  Love you, too, sweetness.  Yeah, this is a great article in Details Magazine.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, why it's okay to pay for sex, Anthony, in some cases, or in a lot of 
[02:21:00]  cases.  Okay.  How about all cases?  According to this article.  Pharrell.  Hey, you guys, I hate to off-track you, but I swear to God, there's so many O&A bitches  out here with Big Rack that I'm in Ractionville in Perth Amboy.  Raction is everywhere.  There's Bouncing Rack, and there is presents.  There's drugs.  There's everything.  We have an EMT, a vomit specialist.  We have hookers.  We have boxers.  We have soap stars, drug dealers. 
[02:21:30]  We got it all.  Actors, rock stars.  Pharrell.  Pharrell.  Pharrell.  Are you going on a boat cruise?  Yes, I'm on the good ship Pharrellipop.  Don't you realize?  We're a copy of Pharrell.  Pharrell.  Pharrell.  It's a monsoon outside.  Yeah, but listen, but where we are, it's funny.  It already blew through, like, going through all them noses in Cleveland.  I was hanging out with the J.  Oh, okay.  No, I had a good time in Cleveland, and I love that city.  I had so much fun at that baseball stadium.  It's awesome. 
[02:22:00]  And downtown Cleveland rocks, the Flats Rocks, and all your fans showed up at my bar for free beer.  And I know I sounded like crap because I was on a deck of a hotel looking on Lake Erie with dead fish.  But they love you there.  And they showed up 100 deep, drunk as skunks.  And I lathered up and just licked face with them.  All right.  Do you have fun, Angel?  We're going to have a good time tonight.  I know that.  This boat is packed with 350 people already. 
[02:22:30]  It's four decks.  It's all indoor.  We're sucking down Jamaican red stripes.  I don't think your heavy stuff is going to come down for quite a while.  He took a pee in a red stripe bottle and a limo.  Shake it out.  Shake it out.  Shake it out.  All right, Pharrell.  You have a good time, okay?  Hey, you guys.  Cool, man.  Be cool.  All right.  Have fun tonight.  Shake it out.  Oh, my God.  All right.  So, Details Magazine, Anthony? 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  Sarah.  What?  Sarah.  Hi.  Hi.  What's going on?  What's going on?  Nothing much.  I have a friend and myself are interested in your little shindig.  Crystal Method party on Tuesday?  Yeah.  How old are you gals?  20.  20 years old, Opie.  And they both want to go.  I assure you we don't look that old.  That old.  All right.  Well, you got to... 
[02:23:30]  I can't just say Sarah.  Sarah.  Sarah.  Sarah Connor.  Ah.  Sarah Connor.  Christy.  Sarah.  Sarah or Christy.  Sarah.  They're not there anymore.  Who happened?  Oh.  See, they must have thought we lost interest in them.  Oh, my God.  Why don't you call back, you silly goose? 
[02:24:00]  Ross, what's going on?  Hey, man.  I am pissed, man.  What?  I've been on hold with Ticketmaster for like an hour.  Yeah.  You're telling me there's no Jim Norton concert in Red Bank, New Jersey?  There is a Jim Norton show in Red Bank.  Ticketmaster sucks!  There is a Jim Norton show August 10th in Red Bank.  Brother, I leave the Red Bank area.  Listen, angel face, I'm not yelling at you.  I'm telling you.  Well, cookie puss, man.  I've been trying to catch up with you for like three months now. 
[02:24:30]  All right.  Well, get a pen real quick.  No, wait.  Get a pen.  I'll tell you how to get tickets.  Hold on, Jim.  Ticketmaster's saying there's no show.  I don't care what Ticketmaster is saying.  Maybe the show was canceled.  No.  They said you're playing in Atlantic City, but you know it's near Red Bank.  Dude, Atlantic City has sold out both shows.  So, Red Bank is 732.  Get your pen, Ross.  842-9000.  August 10th at the Count Basin.  But, Ross, they're saying no show, right?  They're saying they don't even know who Jim Norton is. 
[02:25:00]  Because they don't have me listed on Ticketmaster.  Because the promoter thought it would be a good idea to say, yeah, get tickets to Ticketmaster.  Let retard boy link it.  So, I link it.  Everybody's going.  They're going, what?  No show.  We can go somewhere else.  I don't know, man.  I've been trying to catch up.  You're always sold out when I try to get to you.  Thank you, Angel.  Try me August 10th there, and you can get me there.  All right, Bobby.  Bye-bye.  Bye, Ross.  Thank you.  That really bugged me.  I think Ross was a troublemaker.  People just know what gets to people, man. 
[02:25:30]  I don't know if he was kidding or not, but just to say that they said there was no show.  All right.  I'll be there with bells on, a little book full of jokes to tell the whole audience to show stuff.  What?  I'll have a little notebook full of jokes for everyone.  Yuck, yucks.  Sometimes I even walk on and go, good evening, ladies and germs.  The whole place claps and waves.  This guy's crazy.  He called us germs.  Instead of gentlemen. 
[02:26:00]  Ben, you should really be shot for having your party last night.  Why?  You really should.  I have to explain why you have to do it on a Thursday night.  You have to do it on a Thursday night because in the summer in Manhattan, everyone leaves town.  They go to the Jersey Shore.  They go to Newport.  They go to the Pantons.  Okay.  I don't have to do it that way.  Better yet, if I did it on my real birthday Monday night, then that would be worse.  Yes, he tastes Friday.  That's true.  You can shoot me.  What should he be shot with?  Hopefully not Metamucil.  Did it stink up the bathroom, Ben? 
[02:26:30]  I was waiting for Richard Dreyfuss with AIDS there to come in.  Oh, that faggot with the beard who loves to run in there after you.  You know what?  I really hate having to use that bathroom, too, if anyone else comes in.  I hate that.  I don't like using any bathrooms when people are in there if I got a crunch, man, because  it's a very private moment for me.  Yeah, very private moment.  And sometimes you get such a bad stomachache and you really got to go.  And I run to the back and he's got the door propped open. 
[02:27:00]  The Richard Dreyfuss with AIDS guy that cleans the bathroom.  And he's got the door propped open with his cleaning equipment cart blocking the door open.  And I come around that corner and go, oh, Jesus Christ, I'm just going to crap myself.  The weird thing is he cleans the bathroom for a really long time.  A long time.  And he has to breathe right, strip over his nose so he can enjoy every odor.  He makes me sick.  Hey, Jacques Cousteau, clean it at midnight.  You don't have to clean it at 7 p.m.  He loves being in there when he knows show guys are taking dumps. 
[02:27:30]  He really does.  And he acts like he doesn't know inkling.  Yeah, he shuffles around, doesn't even put gloves on, just scrubs out the toilet.  Hey, if something winds up under my nails, well, I'll eat it on the way home.  Elbow in the ribs.  He makes me sick.  I don't even like taking a leak when he's doing that.  The door's propped open.  People are walking by.  You're just standing there.  The guy doesn't understand.  Close the door.  Clean your stuff at night and get out of there.  I took a leak next to Earl the other day and I looked right over. 
[02:28:00]  I was just staring right at his mule.  Boy, Earl, are you a myth breaker.  Earl looked like he might have five.  I was in the stall and I heard him yell, stop that.  And I didn't know what was going on.  Because I'm standing next to him and I am looking right over past his shirt and I could just get a full view.  Very, very unimpressive.  Earl likes to talk, too, when you're in the bathroom.  He's one of the guys that you'll be in there and you'll be like...  A talker?  He likes to talk. 
[02:28:30]  It's a little awkward.  My two buddies at Pergman, when I used to work there, this guy Malcolm, was taking a dump  and him and this other dude were passing a pound cake under the door.  I swear to God, the guy's under the door and all of a sudden I see a pound cake come back up  and the guy outside takes her, takes a bite.  He has to do a guy taking a dump, a pound cake.  I never will fit my buddy Malcolm McGee in another guy.  I forget the other guy.  It's awful.  Joe, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  I just called Ticketmaster.  Yeah. 
[02:29:00]  And I said I want to see the Ed Norton show in Red Bank, New Jersey.  It's Red Bank, right?  It's not Red Mule.  It's not Red Neck.  It's not Red Butch.  It's not Ed Norton.  You idiot.  What is it?  It's not Ed Norton.  Jim Norton.  No, no, no, no, no.  My point is I asked for Jim Norton and the woman said, are you talking about Ed Norton?  I said, no, I don't want to see the Honeymooners.  I'm looking for Jim Norton.  I hate this call.  Yeah.  He's trying much too hard.  Sure.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Ivan, what's up?  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Little Jimmy.  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday to me. 
[02:29:30]  Listen.  I'm on Ticketron.com.  At this moment, there's a big splash across your face.  It says postpone.  You have to be lying.  That's not true.  I was not postponed.  I'm on it now.  Put it on.  Ticketron.com.  It's just postponed.  Put it on?  Is that your computer lingo?  Put it on?  It's on channel www.  Shut it.  Adjust the aerial.  Dude, I'm not canceled.  It's just postponed.  A big splash. 
[02:30:00]  All right.  One time, my father took us to Nathan's.  Are we going to go back to Nathan's?  Went to Nathan's.  Talking about Nathan's?  Yeah, real quick, because this just reminded me of the pound cake story Jimmy just told us.  He took us to Nathan's, you know, the hot dogs, famous for their hot dogs, and they serve fried chicken and stuff.  So we went into the bathroom, because, you know, my dad took his two sons, and then we all had to take a leak.  So we go into the bathroom, we passed by the stall, and one of the stalls didn't have a door, and sitting on the ball was this old black guy eating Nathan's fried chicken, just sucking on a wing, right there on the ball. 
[02:30:30]  I was like, oh, all right.  Some people don't care.  Mike, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  You know, maybe you guys are better off just telling us where we can buy Details Magazine.  Call 842-9000 in the 732 area code. 
[02:31:00]  No problem.  They might say Count Basie, but they sell Details Magazine.  I hope Ticketmaster burns.  Oh, God.  My stomach is hurting today.  I guess who else's was.  And he's finished with that cheesy pizza.  Bowel moving Ben.  Pizza and coffee?  What's that beverage fleet?  He's dripping sweat from his forehead already. 
[02:31:30]  It's a day after a crazy party.  Right under, like, where Ben's hair meets that, there's just sweat trickling down.  It's awful.  Oh, my God.  He's going to look like he rode his 10-speed bike through a mud puddle up the back.  I bet you when he pushes on those dumbs, his little feet come up off the floor.  The little feet come up off the floor.  Got to take off a little toilet paper and unfog his glasses.  Put him back on.  They fog up in the heat. 
[02:32:00]  Hey, those little feet up there.  Have you ever been in a bathroom, though, in that situation?  Like, there was one guy, it was like a year ago, that worked in the other office on the other,  that would be like,  in there.  Oh, it's horrible.  It's the worst.  I hate this guy.  The ah guy. 
[02:32:30]  Ope's the fastest bathroom guy I've ever seen.  Oh, yeah.  Dude, give me the key.  He'll be back.  No.  And those are all dumbs, too, man.  I don't mess around.  Perfect blonde surfer dumps.  Sit down, they slide right out.  All right, we're healthy.  You're healthy.  Bye-bye now.  If they're fast, it means you're doing a world of hurt to your underwear.  I know.  You're just pulling them off and running out.  Sometimes you've got to sit down and let things cool down. 
[02:33:00]  When do you want...  He knows it's time to go when he feels a little tickle on his ankle.  Your legs fall asleep.  You get off the ball looking like a newborn fawn.  Got a butt hickey.  Dude, I was walking with my buddy Bill D'Angelo to school when I was a little boy, and this  is true.  I used to hate using public bathrooms.  Of course.  I had a log fighting to get out.  Absolutely true story.  And I was clenching.  And I guess the front piece made the escape when I clenched.  And it dropped, and I kicked, and it came out. 
[02:33:30]  And I never lived that down.  I believe it was in fifth grade on Newton Street in North Brunswick.  A little roly-poly piece of log flew right out.  You're free.  I said it's free.  I broke a piece off accidentally and then left.  The first time I met Rick's wife, we traveled down to Florida to check out Rick and his new 
[02:34:00]  girl there, I crapped my pants.  Dude, dude.  No joke, he'll tell you.  It was the most embarrassing thing ever happened to me.  I had shorts on because it was summer.  And they're like, all right, we're going to go drive to Orlando.  And as they left, five minutes later, they're back in my apartment.  They're just like, let me in, let me in, let me in.  No, no, no.  It's a lot better than that.  I was wearing boxers.  Boxers was, you know, pretty in back then. 
[02:34:30]  And I was saying goodbye to Rick and his girlfriend on their stoop.  I thought I could let one slide out.  Oh, God.  Rolling right down the leg.  Oh, my God.  That's horrible.  Oh, my God.  That's awful.  Rolled right out.  Send it free. 
[02:35:00]  That's terrible.  I spent the next hour just teaching his bathroom a lesson.  That's great.  It's such a true story.  It's like, oh.  Yeah, they're right on the front, too.  We'll see you guys later.  I must say, I don't think I've ever had one let go on me.  You know, when in doubt, clinch and take the pain. 
[02:35:30]  You guys remember the year of the pasta marathon?  The chick that ran?  Do you remember that?  Uda Pippig.  Yeah.  Uda.  She won the marathon just with every fluid possible.  She was having her time and diarrhea at the same time.  Yeah.  As she crossed the finish line, they put that foil blanket around there.  Oh.  It was a mess.  Her pants look like a hostess raspberry cake exploded.  That was horrible.  Oh, it looks yummy, but it smells like copper. 
[02:36:00]  Sometimes, oh, you know you're done and nothing else is happening, but you've just got to sit it out.  Sit out the burn.  Wet a paper towel and make a fire block.  Oof, Jesus Christ.  Don't want your underwear.  What an awful conversation.  Women will never see the joy of a good dump chat.  That's one thing that will always separate this kind of guy out there.  I am crying.  I got tears coming down my eyes from these stories. 
[02:36:30]  Every guy's enjoying this.  They're all like, yeah, man.  I really understand that.  Oh, God.  Every woman thinks it's gross and we should move on.  Horrid.  When I first moved to New York, I had a few friends over one night in my old little apartment.  And my friend Decker went to the bathroom.  It smelled so bad, I puked onto my screen out in my courtyard in my building.  And all the puke, it was that bad.  It was all the puke that caught in the screen.  It was the most disgusting thing ever.  Did I ever tell you the time my buddies Bill and Frank were over and still built?  Did you say white? 
[02:37:00]  I swear to God, just to be silly.  Just to be a silly goose.  And I covered it with another piece of awful crumbly peppered farm white.  I put a little club sandwich thing in it.  And as a goof, I showed them.  And I put it in the street and a car ran it over.  It's a true story.  Crumbly white peppered farm.  Those times you have that horrible realization when you're well past the bathroom that you didn't clean up well enough. 
[02:37:30]  As you're walking, you just know, this is really going to be bad when I get home.  And it starts to burn.  You feel like you have a salty potato chip in there.  Get home, your underwear looks like a huge shoe shine rack.  You're killing me.  Dude, I was at my buddy Marvin's house one time, and I would never wipe good enough.  It's true.  Wait, careful.  Okay, let's just say that I would continually do it and always leave a little residual evidence. 
[02:38:00]  Never clean up good enough.  And I would always be, one time it was burning and raw.  You know how you're like 12 and it gets raw and sore?  And I absolutely, I swear on my life, I saw a tube of aqua fresh toothpaste.  I'm like, boy, that looks cool.  Oh, no.  And I dolloped a big old August 10th red bag.  I dolloped a finger full absolutely right in between, and it was wonderful for 10 seconds.  And then it was, my balloon knot was on fire. 
[02:38:30]  I had to run back into Marvin's house.  Toothpaste.  All right.  Marvin.  My buddy Marvin, he's Jewish and Puerto Rican.  You know what we're going to try to do next, Ant?  Not the hungry.  Stop.  They ain't buying that anymore.  God damn.  I'll read the first paragraph, though.  This is what you have to look forward to on Monday.  Let me begin by stating I wouldn't dream of paying for sex.  Never have, never will.  The thought of $120 worth of gentleman's relief at the local massage parlor, unless it's before 
[02:39:00]  four on Sunday, in which case it's $92.50.  Disgust me.  Nevertheless, I have a very close friend who's indulged once or thrice, and I'd like you to  consider the possibility that he isn't a complete loser.  Maybe, just maybe, paying for a piece isn't as morally reprehensible as Lynn Cheney would  have us believe.  Paragraph two, hopefully Monday.  That's a team. 
[02:39:30]  Isn't that right?  And we'll take your stories.  Remind us, please.  All the stories?  Yeah, that did so good today.  You know what?  It really worked out today.  I don't know if the listeners learned anything today, but we're going to try.  I'm taking a dump.  We're going to try, though.  I think we might get some good stuff.  Dump, dump, AIDS.  Did we play, uh...  Painted blood.  Did we play Rick's Muppet song?  I don't remember.  The AIDS Muppet?  The AIDS Muppet Show?  We tried to play it.  Oh, Pablo talked over it.  Oh, yeah, he talked over it, so we'll play it again.  It's very funny about the, um... 
[02:40:00]  Oh, my God.  HIV puppet.  It's time to bend you over.  Cover your A with Y.  Let's all infect our blood now.  He's Muppet Jones tonight.  It's time to get a mouthful.  Hey, while this new guy dies.  It's time for Sores and Lesions. 
[02:40:30]  A Muppet show tonight.  Our blood is really tainted.  We know we're gonna die.  So why should we use condoms?  I just bag me three more guys.  It's time to get things started.  So loose can't tell I farted.  Why don't we get things started?  I'm the most sensational.  Homosexual.  Infectional.  We love anal.  This is what we call a small bitch show. 
[02:41:00]  Well, you guys are both...  You're like a black eye for all mankind.  I don't think they're very nice people.  The only way I could actually think they were funny was to be on heroin.  The Opie and Anthony show.  You know, I just like want to throw up.  The fields of love.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up, man?  Look at all the stuff we didn't get to today.  That means Monday we're already set to go. 
[02:41:30]  We don't have to prepare for Monday's show.  Great.  What's up there, Jimmy?  You said to remind you...  I just can't stop telling dumb stories.  I was on my way with my buddy Paul.  The door jam story is the best one, though.  My buddy...  That's my friend, Jerry.  He's like 45.  And this is recently in New York.  He was out jogging.  And he had an attack of the stomach cramps.  And he's like, uh-oh.  So he hops in a cab.  He can't even jog home.  He hops in a cab.  He looks like a fourth-floor walk-up. 
[02:42:00]  He makes it all the way up.  As he's walking into his apartment, he trips on the door jam.  And just right into his pants.  If he didn't trip, he would have made it.  You would have made it fine.  But then tripping on the door jam, his stomach muscles just went, go for it!  There's that feeling you get when you get close.  Your stomach almost starts pushing you immediately.  Yeah, you're like, oh my God, I'm here.  You're going back and forth from leg to leg trying to get the old trow down.  It's like your stomach can see where you are.  It's like, all right, he's getting there.  Let's get ready to go. 
[02:42:30]  You're friggin' funny, man.  I took one in the woods one time on my way to steal comic books with my buddy Paul.  And I had actually not made it because I definitely had, definitely the turtle had poked his head out and made that little brown dime mark.  Like a little dime stamped in my, and I'm in the woods.  I, I, I, I, God.  It's like a little corporate seal.  And I'm in the woods.  It's like a wax seal on Napoleon's communique.  Like a little, you ever see like, you ever see like little chocolate money? 
[02:43:00]  That's what it looked like.  And so I, I obviously remove, and I'm standing there, and I'm finally getting some relief, and there are yellow jackets flying between my legs.  I was near a beehive, and there were bees buzzing back and forth over my dump.  The ones in the woods are great when you're hunting or camping, and before you're even finished, before it even drops, the big green-eyed flies are landing on it.  It's like at least let it hit the goddamn ground. 
[02:43:30]  And it just looks so piping hot.  When it's a little chilly out, the steam coming off it, nice piping hot treat for flies.  Nice.  Is there anything better than a piping hot lock?  It's like a hot pocket.  That's 92.3 degrees.  Dude, you've got to mention the gas paint.  We never stopped, by the way.  We took a commercial break, but we kept going during the whole break.  We kept talking and laughing. 
[02:44:00]  I'm going to take that.  Awful.  The gas paint thing is hilarious.  Those are the worst.  Because I almost didn't, I haven't done this in a long time, but I almost didn't make it recently.  I mean, you go to, because I get really bad stomach gas pains.  Yeah.  And then you just, like, your belt's undone, and you're just ready to sit, and then you get that, like, gas pain, and you can't sit.  So I'm standing there, and I'm like, it's going to come out.  But I couldn't sit because it felt like somebody was stabbing me in the stomach.  I love thump stories.  They're always appropriate.  Oh, man. 
[02:44:30]  Chicks never appreciate them.  I am woozy from laughing so much.  Jesus Christ, you guys.  Girls, sit down.  Boom, boom.  Done.  Yeah.  He just dumped his coffee all over the place.  You lost your iced coffee.  You know what?  We can't even play What Did We Learn Today, which means we got absolutely nothing done.  Nothing accomplished today.  This wonderful Friday.  This is the radio show you want to listen to, Boston.  Seems to be.  Boston made us number one today.  Men, 18 to 49. 
[02:45:00]  Once again, Anthony.  Yes, thank you.  We killed in the ratings in Boston.  So we want to thank the fine people in Boston for supporting the show, Anthony.  Thank God.  Thank you, Boston.  We're now number one in New York, Philly, and Boston.  We'll see what happens in D.C. on Monday.  Yep.  I guess that's it.  That seems to be it.  If you're in Boston, stay tuned for Melissa.  If you're in New York, stay tuned for Ron and Fez.  If you're in Philly, stay tuned for Cousin Ed.  Isn't Kid Chris following us in Sacramento? 
[02:45:30]  We did well in the Sacramento ratings today.  Not number one yet, but we're heading that way.  So thank you, Sacramento, as well.  Okay?  Roy!  No, I'm not looking today.  All right, well, that's how it ends, I guess.  There you go.  There you go. </pre>
