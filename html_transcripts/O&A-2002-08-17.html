<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie’s lengthy, exasperated account of his frustrating DMV experiences, involving multiple trips and bureaucratic snafus related to vehicle registration. This was followed by a shockingly graphic and violent song about killing kittens.  The show then abruptly shifted to a brief discussion about a double date, before launching into a commercial break featuring ads for Toyota, Lexus, Ford, Anheuser-Busch, WWF SummerSlam, X Games, Marriott, State Farm, Skies the Limit Skydiving, The Wiz, and Goldfingers gentlemen's clubs.

Technical difficulties interrupted the broadcast, requiring a brief interview with studio engineer Pete Johnson to resolve the audio issues.  Following the fix, the hosts angrily addressed negative press coverage, specifically targeting Dean Johnson from the Boston Herald and Dave Dickless from their former employer, AAF, vowing retribution for what they perceived as unfair treatment related to their return to Boston radio.  A substantial portion then focused on the controversy surrounding their "WOW" (Whip Them Out Wednesday) advertising campaign, which resulted in the removal of their billboards from Westchester County buses after a single complaint.  They discussed the ensuing media coverage from local papers (The Patent Trader and The Journal News), the Associated Press, and anticipated further national attention, even fielding calls from News 12 Westchester about the story.  They teased upcoming guests, including Jim Brewer and Marilyn Manson.

The next segment featured a humorous and detailed recounting of an incident involving "Blind Matt," a blind participant in a previous blind boxing competition.  Blind Matt received a lap dance from strippers at Privilege, during which his unexpectedly large penis was exposed, much to everyone's amusement.  A female caller expressed interest in him, and Blind Matt himself later called in, corroborating the story and adding details about his drunken state and missing his train.  Studio guest Jim Brewer shared a story about being caught masturbating by his girlfriend.  The segment also included discussion of the explicit Japanese video game "Boonga Boonga" and detailed allegations of sexual assault against Marilyn Manson, interspersed with commercials for Hotwire, Toyota, Heineken, Ultimate V, and Subaru.

A comedian, Jay, called in to report overwhelmingly positive audience reception in Cleveland, including requests for a live show.  The conversation then devolved into sexually explicit and crude descriptions of Serena Williams' physique and speculation about her relationship with her father.  Jay mentioned a sold-out show at the Improv.  This was followed by further discussion of the Westchester County billboard removal, with Opie and Anthony comparing the action to McCarthyism.  Caller Chris provided a live update on the news story.  The segment concluded with a lengthy, graphic, and highly explicit recounting by Jim Brewer of getting caught masturbating in his car with his wife and grandmother present, accompanied by vulgar jokes, sound effects, and listener calls sharing similar experiences. The segment ended with more advertisements and discussion of a Hooters party following the show, which involved a significant beer fight.

The final segment detailed the events at the Hooters party, describing it as initially well-behaved but escalating into a beer fight involving Fox employees.  The hosts praised the waitresses’ service and mentioned "angry Angel," a participant who made a memorable comment.  They also speculated on Bill O’Reilly's potential interest in footage from the event.

But we have to tell you, these Camry offers end September 4th.  So take advantage now.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I like it.  Oh, oh, I like it.  Our, our, our, our.  By Opie and Anthony.  All owned by Inquinity Broadcasting. 
[00:00:30]  The station for sports guys, Don and Mike, Opie and Anthony, and Ron and Fez is this station.  1027 WNEW, New York.  Anytime, Einstein.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The show blow, blow, blow, blow.  Bluff, blow, blow.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Bluff, blow, blows. 
[00:01:00]  The show blows, monkey ass.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Today, I'd like to talk to you on a very serious note.  Because this is the story of a man overcoming monumental physical pain and suffering.  Because I went to the DMV today and it was really, really ugly.  There's nothing funny about what you're about to hear.  Everything was organized.  I went in there.  That's such a part of just being like a man.  I am.  Just going to motor vehicle.  Well, Anthony, I'm not a man. 
[00:01:30]  Work with me, son.  So, I get to the lady, and I must say, the nicest DMV lady ever.  Ever.  She wasn't the problem this time.  The last three times, they were the problem.  All right?  So, she's going through all the forms like, okay, we'll get you out of here in a jiffy.  Right?  And she's going through all the stuff.  And I'm like, all right, finally.  Fourth time going to DMV to get my vehicle registered.  This is it.  I'm finally going to have New York plates.  Who's be told, today's world can be namby-pamby.  All of a sudden, she says, okay, I just need a copy of the title. 
[00:02:00]  Is this the title?  I started panicking.  What to do?  What to do?  So, I had to get the leasing company on the line.  This was the last time I went to send me the power of attorney, basically saying it's okay to register the car in New York State.  All right?  Uh-huh.  You would think that people, when they're sending that, would send a copy of the title knowing I'm going to need that as well, Anthony.  No, you can't expect them to do that.  So, I don't have the title.  So, now I can't do it.  So, now I'm ready to go home. 
[00:02:30]  Which means I'd have to go back to the DMV for the fifth time.  No, no, no.  So, then the lady sees the panic on my face.  She goes, look, can you get the leasing company to fax it over, the title?  If I get a fax of it, boom, you're out of here in two minutes.  I'm like, no problem.  He realizes he's got to get it.  So, I go out in the hall.  It's key to the story that you know I only had 70 cents in my pocket.  I call the leasing company and I explain my situation.  I need my, you know, the title faxed over to the DMV. 
[00:03:00]  Mm-hmm.  The lady says, I can't do that for you.  You have to talk to Judy.  Judy is busy with another customer.  You'll have to call her back.  Click, hangs up on me.  No, no, no.  I don't have enough money to call damn Judy.  So, what do I do?  I drive all the way home.  He figures, what the heck?  And I call Judy and I give her a piece of my mind.  I say, Judy, listen, you have to fax a copy of the title to DMV right now.  Will there be a problem?  She says, oh, no problem at all.  Will you do it now? 
[00:03:30]  She goes, yes.  I go, okay.  I am going to leave my house for the DMV.  I expect that title to be faxed when I get there.  That is beautiful.  All right, it gets better.  So, I go back to the DMV.  Everyone knows now because I was there an hour before or whatever, okay?  I spend 20 minutes staring at the fax machine waiting for a copy of the title to come through.  What to do?  What to do?  20 minutes later, it's not coming through the fax machine, okay?  He said it would not work.  After 20 minutes away in the DMV, I'm like, okay, there's a problem. 
[00:04:00]  Now, I have to make another call.  I don't have any change.  No, no, no.  So, I'm at the customer service.  I explain, look, the lady was supposed to fax it 20 minutes ago.  I've been staring at the fax machine.  There's a problem.  I need to use your phone.  She goes, there's a phone in the lobby there or whatever, right?  I said, no, I have one nickel.  I can't make a call.  The lady, supposedly part of customer service, goes, you'll have to talk to a supervisor.  His arm arose.  I go, it's a goddamn phone call.  Give me your phone.  Sir, you're building bridges.  You're making friends. 
[00:04:30]  Now, the real friendly teller heard me screaming at the lady, and she goes, come here, come here.  And she goes, here.  And she hands me a cordless phone.  I go, thank you.  And then I turn to the customer service lady, and I go, was that hard to do?  He got up and got one.  So I call the leasing company again.  I go, hi.  Remember you said you would fax it in 20 minutes?  I've been staring at the fax machine.  Guess what?  Nothing is popping out.  What's the problem?  Oh, I'll fax it right over. 
[00:05:00]  I made a copy of it.  It was too light, blah, blah, blah.  I'm like, will you fax it right now before I come back in here with an automatic weapon and shoot everybody?  And did she?  She did.  She did?  Fifteen minutes later, she sends it over.  You've got moxie.  And don't let anyone ever take that away from you.  And then I paid my $72.50.  So I wrote the check and I got out of there.  Young man, do you ever look back and wonder what would have happened if you'd just given up, if you hadn't followed your dream?  I took five trips to DMV to get my license and my registration. 
[00:05:30]  And I think we've all learned a lesson from this.  You've showed us that while no man is an island, one man can make a difference.  And now I'm registered in New York.  Pretty cool.  I'd say you are very cool.  A very cool cat, indeed.  I'll do this one for all the animal lovers since they like gerbil so much.  Uh-oh.  It's a sing-along, too.  So everybody, feel free to join in.  Follow the bugs and bulls.  When the game of life makes you feel like quitting, it helps a lot if you kill a kitten. 
[00:06:00]  Mark my words, cause from where I'm sitting, you can't go wrong if you kill a kitten.  Look at those bones. 
[00:06:30]  There's no crime that you'll be committing.  I know the law, you can, everybody, kill a kitten.  And if you need yarn for that scarf you're knitting, you'll get plenty when you kill a kitten. 
[00:07:00]  Feed it turpentine or break its spine.  Crush it with your shoe as long as you kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Listen up.  If the one you love isn't quite as smitten, she'll like you better when you kill a kitten.  And I'll quote the Bible, cause that's where it's written. 
[00:07:30]  If he loveth Jesus, he must kill a kitten.  Throw him at a train.  Make him snort cocaine.  Drown him in a lake.  Bake a kitty cake.  Flush him down the can.  Hit him with your van. 
[00:08:00]  Stick some TNT up his cut booty.  Do what you must do, as long as you kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  You got to kill a kitten.  All right.  Killing kittens isn't easy. 
[00:08:30]  And if the thought makes you feel queasy, grab a pitchfork from the shed.  Then kill a puppy dog instead.  Kill a kitten.  You got to kill a kitten.  A little furry kitten. 
[00:09:00]  You got to kill a kitten.  You got to kill a mother.  You got to kill a son of me.  Kill a little f***ing daddy.  Kill him in a...  To 8-6-7-5-3-0-9.  To 8-6-7-5-3-0-9.  Yeah.  Steven Lentz, everyone.  Opie and Anthony.  You can just tell that there was bloody child's underpants in one of their apartments. 
[00:09:30]  Opie were worse than serial killers.  Yeah, well.  I don't understand what's so bad about teen guestlets in my pants.  The Opie and Anthony show.  What a show this is.  1027 WNEW.  Drive home with ONA.  Drive to work with the sports guys.  You're on with Pete Rose, the all-time hit team.  Is it true that you only slid into bases head first so you wouldn't break coke vials in your back pocket?  Stop it, Carter. Stop it, Carter.  That's fine. That's okay.  I mean, that's not true, though, is it? 
[00:10:00]  And we've lost Pete.  Sports guys, Blaine and Craig.  Mornings, 1027.  WNEW.  Where are they with the taquizas? How long can they possibly take?  Not kidding. I'm starting to go numb.  This is my first double date. Anything that makes it more interesting is definitely a bonus.  Well, I think it's definitely interesting that I'm uncontrollably attracted to Laura instead of you.  Of course you are. She's a dumb blonde, and you're an idiot.  Yeah, personality only goes so far, but looks are everything. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, and it doesn't hurt that she's not wearing a bra.  You ain't kidding.  Hey, feels great to speak your mind, doesn't it?  Taquizas, the one and only beer with an upfront blend of blue agave nectar, Mexican tequila, and lime flavor.  Because, come on, the world's simply a better place when you don't hold anything back.  So speak your mind, drink your beer.  Taquizas!  Hey, guys. We're back with the Taquizas.  Wow. I'd wish he'd leave and I could have you both.  Can I call you sometime?

Guitarist from Weezer, uh, he's in the nut house.  For what reason?  He checked himself into the kook bin.  Yeah, don't look at your headphones like that, Opie.  I'm looking at the same thing.  Someone, why do people screw with stuff in this studio? 
[00:20:00]  It's muddy now, right?  Are you hearing yourself completely muddy?  Yeah, it sucks.  Yeah, that's what I'm hearing, too.  It's making me yell.  No one out there...  Sounds like crap.  I don't understand, but, uh...  No, because it probably sounds like crap out there, too.  Our voices sound really whacked in our headphones, and it's very distracting.  Then Pete will come in and go, I changed that.  Oh, that's better.  That's it.  That's better.  How's that for you?  You like that?  Yeah.  Nice.  That's better.  Which button are we supposed to have down?  The pre-delay monitor, or the one that says this one? 
[00:20:30]  I like this one.  Because when you push the button that says this one, boink.  You get crap off.  You get crap, the mud.  Turn that off.  So you go to this one, which isn't the one you're supposed to push, because it doesn't  say this one on this one.  Now, that's much better.  Let Pete Johnson, crack engineer, explain what those buttons do.  Pete Johnson.  I'm just curious.  We won't take too much time with this.  Hi, Pete Johnson.  Hello.  Pete, are we supposed to push down the one that says this one, or the one that doesn't 
[00:21:00]  say this one?  Pre-delay.  Pre-delay?  Yeah.  So why do we have this one?  Because that used to be this one.  And who pushed that one down?  This one used to be that one.  Oh, but now this one isn't that one.  The one that isn't this one is that one.  Exactly.  All right.  Well, that's perfectly explained.  Right on, Pete.  Thank you.  Thank you, Pete Johnson.  Makes perfect sense.  This one is no longer that one.  I know.  Wow.  Thank God that was fixed.  We learned something right off the bat today on the O&A show.  All right.  We got to get going with a radio program here. 
[00:21:30]  If you're in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, we want to hear from you as well.  What?  866-277-4WOW.  Yes, Anthony?  Was anybody at the Hooters signing last night?  Did we have any people?  I'm hearing from two groups of people.  People that were there and able to stay and people that were there and thrown out.  Seems like a lot of people got thrown out.  Like a lot of people got thrown out.  We'll get into the whole Hooters mess in a little while, Ant.  All right.  Because it was a lot of fun. 
[00:22:00]  We got to say hi to everybody that made it down.  We have a bunch of pictures up on opiananthony.com from last night's festivities.  The picture is kind of boring.  You might...  People coming up.  You see a few cans and whatnot.  Yeah.  You might get an idea of what was going on.  We'll get into it in a little bit.  But I got to tell you, man, thank God I don't have a shallow ego or anything.  Why is that?  Well, every day we come into work, we go into our office, and plunk down on all our desks  is all the negative press for the day for us to read. 
[00:22:30]  With a show like this, bring it on.  Bring it on.  We don't care.  You're just making us bigger.  I enjoy it.  Dean Johnson, you effing tool from the Boston Herald, you piece of crap.  He used to kiss our ass when we were at AF.  What's the problem, dick?  Remember, he was all nice to us when we used to go to events and whatnot.  He'd want exclusive interviews with us.  And now he seems to be a little angry with the program.  He's a guy that kisses AF's ass in Boston. 
[00:23:00]  And he's on AF's side.  Yeah.  And he's a little pissed off that we gave the exclusive that we're coming back to Boston  to Jim Sullivan from the Globe.  So he decides to write a piece of crap article on us today in the Boston Herald.  Well, they've got to choose their sides, Opie.  It's just sad that he'll choose the losing side of AF.  I don't want to bore people to death, but we've been back in Boston maybe a week.  We have no listeners whatsoever.  We have some of our old fans checking in so far, and they're spreading the word. 
[00:23:30]  And we're going to build an audience once again in Boston.  And we will kick everyone's ass in Boston.  There's no doubt in our mind.  Right.  And everyone is seeing way into the fact that we're back in Boston.  They think the station we're on, WBCN, is now changing formats because Anthony and I  are on the airwaves.  Hey, it's not like they put...  You stupid douches.  It's not like they put Rush Limbaugh on.  You know?  It's us.  It's us.  We're a rock and roll talk show.  Yeah.  They think we're not going to play any music whatsoever.  They think we're not going to be talking to all the cool bands that are out there now. 
[00:24:00]  You freaking tools.  Just wait and see what we do to you in this stupid city.  Look what we do to you now.  Not that Boston's a stupid city.  I'm just pissed off.  Dean Johnson.  Doesn't even get the characters of the show right.  Awful.  We'll get into that a little bit.  We'll get Dean on the phone if he's brave enough today.  See if we can get Dean on the phone.  Is that Dean on the phone?  Really like to straighten a few things out with him.  Everyone running around scared in Boston because we're back. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  Well, you know what it is?  They're trying to fit us into a little category of talk and trying to spin it that way.  This isn't your normal talk show, people.  And Dave Dickless from AAF, our old program director that didn't stand up for us and stabbed us in the back when we did the whole mayor's prank.  Yeah.  Ha ha.  You can't use the S word, Opie.  I had to dump out.  He's a piece of S, you could say.  He takes out a whole ad in R&R saying, you know, BCN, thanks for the last 33 years. 
[00:25:00]  Good luck with the new format.  The new format.  Oh, oh, oh.  I bet he was just cranking it out to that one.  What a genius I am.  Oh, oh.  It's not a new format, my friend.  Spin it all you like.  I'm going to be kicking your ass, Dickless.  You just watch all the bands that start appearing on our show and playing live.  You just watch.  I can't wait to kick everyone's ass in Boston. 
[00:25:30]  Dave Dickless, who are you going to put in afternoons after Rock Hole just goes down the crapper?  Who are you going to put there?  Hmm.  Are you even going to be there anymore, Dickless?  Hmm.  Hmm, Dave.  What are you going to do?  Take an ad out in the R&R?  Congratulations.  Good luck with the new format.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, you got us.  What a great gang.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  That's almost as good as flying a plane over Fenway to pick Rocko's new sidekick at random. 
[00:26:00]  Another phony thing.  More fake radio.  You'll see.  You'll see.  Hey, come on.  I got to eat.  WBCN in Boston is bigger and better than ever.  Yep.  You just watch what we end up doing.  And here it comes.  You just watch how we keep the heritage at WBCN.  Bunch of tools up there.  Remember, Dave, how you used to giggle like a chick? 
[00:26:30]  I used to giggle like a school bitch when we used to tool on people when we were at your station.  Remember that?  We were doing that for us, for our show, Dave.  Not for you.  And now that we're your enemy, it's going to come back at you.  Remember all that stuff?  Remember how you used to giggle?  Now you'd be in a fetal position in the shower weeping.  I'm already getting reports from Boston that people are coming up to the Rocko and going, F-Rocko, F-A-F.  We were the ones that made AF in Boston cool to listen to. 
[00:27:00]  And we will make it uncool to listen to.  Simple as that.  Simple as effing that.  And we have an army in place up in Boston.  They're gathering again.  They're starting to realize, holy S, these tools are back on the airwaves in Boston.  Wait until we send up all our boys and girls from New York to the Boston Colleges in a couple weeks.  It's going to be a nightmare for you guys.  It's going to be an insane army up there.  So lucky that you tape your phone calls and edit them in clever little ways to make them sound fun by putting fake things in, Rocko. 
[00:27:30]  So lucky you do that.  Because if you took live phone calls, you'd be barraged.  You'd be barraged, Frank, Rocko, whatever.  Whatever you're calling yourself.  Frank.  Speaking of Frank, get me a hot dog.  You would sit there and have to take calls.  And, Rocko, Frank, you suck.  Yeah, shut up.  Back to music.  I don't know what to do.  He'd be dying. 
[00:28:00]  But he tapes the phone calls.  And then if they don't go well, he'll edit it and throw in lines and words and comments to the caller that they never heard in the first place.  More phony, fake radio.  So, there you have it.  Yeah!  Spin it all you like.  You know, thanks for the last 33 years.  Good luck with the new format.  Dave Dickless, you piece of crap.  We have so many surprises for you, you don't even know.  You're going to be weeping in the corner like Glenn Close from The Big Chill. 
[00:28:30]  Yep.  In the fetal position, sucking your thumb.  Make it stop.  Make it stop.  Make it stop.  Damn it.  I don't know what to do.  So, just another crappy article on you and I in the Boston Papers today, Anthony.  Never had to deal with us.  We were an ally at one point.  Now we are the enemy.  And we will take our fans out of exile and vanquish you. 
[00:29:00]  Vanquish you!  Oh.  Or, you know, kick your ass in the rain.  Whatever.  Dean Johnson in the Boston Herald today.  BCN is working hard to keep up its faltering music image, even during Opie and Anthony shows.  Last week, there were backstage reports from the OzFest and Rock News reports during breaks.  This is still a rock and roll show, my friends.  Just wait and see.  All right, Ant.  Moving on to the next piece of business in the newspaper.  Yeah.  Well, this one is going national, my friends. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  You watch this thing grow into something uncontrollable.  It's already starting to grow.  It started in a Westchester paper.  The patent trader.  What the hell is the patent trader?  The patent trader.  It's a newspaper from where?  North Westchester.  North Westchester.  North Westchester's community newspaper since 1956.  Uh-huh.  And we made the front page of the news, I guess, a couple days back. 
[00:30:00]  Thanks for the heads up, by the way.  A lot of people sent this article in.  It says, shock jocks.  Shock jocks ads whipped off county buses.  You know, I'm going to go around with a cattle prod so that when the reporters say,  are you shock jocks, then you really put like 25,000 volts in their ass?  And go, yeah.  Because I hate that.  Shock jock.  Ugh.  Listen to this.  Bunch of wimps in local government up there in northern Westchester. 
[00:30:30]  Officials removed bus billboards in the wake of a complaint.  One person complained they got rid of all our advertising up in the north Westchester area, Anthony.  Uh-huh.  We have a huge campaign going on, not to bore you, but it's basically our WOW bumper stickers.  And they're on billboards.  They're on subway platforms, train stops, back of buses, I said.  We even have a three-story by three-story WOW billboard in the middle of Times Square.  Yep.  That you can see on TRL pretty much every day. 
[00:31:00]  How long do you think that's going to be up?  Matter of fact, hold on.  Well, we'll get into it in a second.  Mike, what's up?  Opie Anthony, what's up?  Hey.  This morning on the Channel 11 morning news, the WOW sign in Times Square, clear as day.  I know.  We're going to have that clip on foundrymusic.com.  Yeah, the local news, Channel 11 in New York.  They opened up their newscast with a shot of Times Square, and there, in all its glory,  is our huge WOW billboard in the middle of Times Square.  Yep.  It's pretty cool, man.  Well, you watch what happens starting today, my friend. 
[00:31:30]  Hey, when's Dice coming back on?  Um, sooner than later.  Sooner than later, that's all I can say.  None of your business, okay?  Check out, face.  Hopefully, before we go on vacation, we'll hear from him, okay?  When are you guys going on vacation?  Uh, late next week.  All right.  But we have great, great stuff.  Oh, weren't we going to fake a suspension?  Nah, just going on vacation.  No, no.  We don't fake suspensions on our show.  It really happens.  Isn't that strange?  A whole year goes by.  I never take vacation, but I get a two-week suspension every year. 
[00:32:00]  At the same time.  When it's not the spring or fall book, because the summer book doesn't mean much in the radio world.  Too funny.  So I'll make sure I do my fake suspension in the summer.  Dave, I'm putting in for suspension.  I want to go to Florida.  Fake.  All right.  Officials removed bus billboards in the wake of a complaint.  Forty billboards were pulled from Westchester County B-Line buses last week after county officials learned the ads were promoting a raunchy radio team. 
[00:32:30]  Who could that be?  That would be you and I.  Act, act.  How about that?  The advertisements, which feature the word WOW in yellow lettering against a black background, were taken off county buses last Tuesday and Wednesday, according to Lawrence Sally, commissioner of the Westchester County Department of Transportation.  County officials said they were not aware that WOW in the ads stands for Whip Them Out Wednesday.  Who doesn't know that by now?  And as a promotion for the Opie and Anthony show, which airs daily, which airs daily. 
[00:33:00]  All sorts of news stations are taping us right now.  So, great.  I'm going to get to check that out tonight on Channel 5 News.  Me slurring that word.  And, which airs daily on WNEW, listeners apply WOW bumper stickers to their vehicles with the hope that female listeners will see the sticker and bear their breasts.  Yeah, that's one meaning of WOW, right, Anthony?  Another one is people just put the stickers on as support for the show and say, hey, you know, I'm listening.  Yeah, there are a lot of ladies that put WOW in their car and they don't want to see nothing. 
[00:33:30]  They're just supporting the show.  That doesn't mean that there's a lady in this car that's WOWing.  They're just supporting the show.  And it also definitely means whip them out Wednesday.  We're not going to try to back down and, you know, cower to the man.  Westchester County Executive Andrew Spano received a complaint via email on August 3rd regarding the bus billboards, according to Donna Green, a spokeswoman for Spano.  The email writer, a woman who said she was offended by the ads, tipped officials off to the meaning of WOW.  Now, the email complaint was forwarded to Sally, who ordered the billboards removed and then turned into the, oh, oh, who ordered the billboards removed and then tuned into the program. 
[00:34:00]  It's hard to read because it's a copy of a copy.  It's not something I would listen to and I wouldn't let my young daughters listen to it.  Yes.  He said.  By Wednesday, August 8th, the beeline was WOW free.  WOW free.  Thank God.  Do you know how many lives they saved by pulling WOW?  Oh, that's right.  None.  What?  Thank God the word WOW isn't on the back of a bus. 
[00:34:30]  Is it really that offensive?  That's the question I have today.  Is it really that offensive?  Is the word WOW, it doesn't even say whip them out Wednesday on anything.  Was anyone actually offended when they saw WOW written on a bus board, driving down the road on a bus?  Did you look and go, oh, my God, as if you just saw the worst hardcore pornography on the back of a bus?  I'd say no.  One woman email. 
[00:35:00]  One woman emails.  All of a sudden, they go on a frenzy to get all these billboards off the buses.  Yeah.  One woman email.  Bunch of tools up there.  Joe.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  This article is sponsored by the National Organization of Women.  Uh, it's sponsored.  No, they got their claws in the middle of this mess.  Yeah, they got their cat claws in it.  No, this negative press sponsored by Lifestyles Condoms.  When you're going to get F'd, you might as well use Lifestyles Condoms.  Later, guys.  All right. 
[00:35:30]  Thank you, Ruth.  Uh, Sally said he inspects each ad placed on beeline buses, but did not realize this one's meaning.  I thought it was, wow, listen to this radio station.  Yeah.  It could mean that.  You know, we did talk to this paper, and they have our quotes.  It's always fun to read, because, you know, when we're doing this on the air, we're just  goofing off, and, you know, we don't give a flying F.  And then when you read it, it's like, ooh, I said that.  Let's see what we said.  In an on-air interview with the patent trader August 9th, the shock jocks were surprised 
[00:36:00]  to hear about the county's decision.  They then launched into a tirade against the county for bowing down to groups that have some  letterhead and think they have power.  Groups?  I was wrong.  It was bowing down to one person that sent an email.  My God, man.  Yeah, it wasn't even like a campaign.  It was one lady.  No.  It was one lady emailed, said, I'm offended by wow, and that's it.  So I guess if you call up and say you're offended by something else you see on one of these  bus boards, they'll just pull it off, right? 
[00:36:30]  Right?  Yeah.  They might as well.  If it offends one person, they got to just take off all the billboards.  Uh, let's see what else is there.  Uh, the duo said, the duo said this was the first time they have heard complaints about  their advertising.  The billboards are common in New York City, said Opie, whose real name is Greg Hughes.  Oh, you got me.  Oh, you got something on me that no one else knows.  Oh, my God.  Print it.  You idiot.  Gotcha.  That's not my real name, you jerk.  Ha ha.  They didn't get me, did they? 
[00:37:00]  It's my birth name.  I've had this stupid name since I was 12.  Which one?  Greg Hughes?  No.  Opie's?  My parents don't even call me by the name they gave me.  Ah, this is everyone.  And I don't acknowledge my last name at this time in my career.  You don't?  No.  I don't acknowledge it.  I'm like Prince and Cher.  I go by one name.  And Madonna.  And Madonna.  Yeah, look, you got that whole thing going.  You've never heard me say...  Madonna, Cher, Opie. 
[00:37:30]  You've never heard me say Opie Hughes, right?  No.  Don't acknowledge my last name.  And my uncles and aunts and cousins couldn't be happier.  No.  Entree.  Entree.  Then it says, you can't go a block without seeing a city bus with a wow on it, Hughes said.  We have a wow billboard in the middle of Times Square.  Three stories by three stories.  Who said that, Abbott?  Hughes said it.  I didn't say anything, Abbott.  Look at us being Kreskin here.  It says, Hughes said the incident would generate publicity for their program, which was recently nationally syndicated. 
[00:38:00]  Hughes' partner, Anthony Cumia...  Damn it, he got me!  Damn it, I'm hit!  I thought I got away unscathed by his deep-digging reporting of my name.  And you know they did some deep-digging reporting to try to find out your last name.  What's his last name?  Oh, it's right here.  Hughes' partner, Anthony Cumia, said there are more pressing issues in the region. 
[00:38:30]  I think there are 20 billion things more offensive on the street than the letters wow on the back of a bus.  People know we're all about having fun.  Levy plans to send letters to the station protesting the slogan and will contact other NOW members.  You protest all you want.  Your letters go in the garbage.  You know what people do with NOW?  They take a line, you put it by the end, and it turns into wow real easy.  I've seen some NOW stickers turn into wow stickers. 
[00:39:00]  So this is where it gets interesting, my friend.  Yes, it does.  So this appeared a couple days ago.  And we thought it was just kind of going to go away.  Now the journal news is getting involved.  I haven't even...  Here, you want to read this one?  I haven't even read this one yet.  This came out today, right?  The journal news?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, this is in another newspaper?  Yeah.  The journal news.  I guess it's the competition of the patent trader in northern Westchester community. 
[00:39:30]  Ooh.  Newspaper war.  Westchester County stripped 40 ads off the backs of its beeline buses after county officials  learned they urged women to bare their breasts.  Ooh.  The four-foot-by-three-foot ads dominated by the word WOW, an acronym for Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  It's not an acronym.  It just...  It's short for it.  Bye.  Our promotion for the Opie and Anthony Show, which airs daily on WNAW, of course. 
[00:40:00]  Listeners slap WOW bumper stickers on their cars and trucks, hoping women will flash their  breasts as they drive by.  Ellen Flaherty of Yorktown Heights complained about the bus ads via email.  Oh, it puts her name in the paper.  Ellen Flaherty.  Hmm.  Yorktown Heights.  She complained about the bus ads via email August 3rd, according to county spokeswoman Donna  Green.  She said she was raising two pre-teenage daughters, insert joke here, and didn't believe female 
[00:40:30]  taxpayers should be encouraged to whip out their breasts.  Female taxpayers?  What does taxpaying have to do with it?  Second woman also complained, but county officials couldn't locate...  And do we really encourage people to do this?  We always say, if you feel like it, do it.  If not, whatever.  It's out there.  And we're like, don't harass the ladies.  There's plenty of ladies that'll just do it.  Right.  Because they want to.  Because they feel the power of their boobies.  Look at this.  A second woman also complained, but county officials couldn't locate her email yesterday. 
[00:41:00]  The complaints were forwarded to County Transportation Commissioner Lauren Sally, who had never heard  the radio show and had no idea what Flaherty meant.  He asked around and found a young male staffer who explained the wow phenomenon.  Could you imagine this going on in the office?  Get that young go-getter Johnson in here.  Get me that young go-getter.  He'll know.  Yes, boss?  What is this wow?  Well, it's whip them out Wednesday and it's a phenomenon. 
[00:41:30]  You're going to go far, boy.  Like the Daily Planet or something.  Once I checked into it and found out what it meant, I pulled the ads.  Oh.  Sally said.  Doing your job.  Way to go.  Very good.  Very good.  We found it offensive.  I thought it was certainly exploitive of women.  And that's not something that this county will condone.  The ads were history by August 8th.  No one's weird.  Out of all the ads you see out there, they're worried about the word wow. 
[00:42:00]  You know, I don't care what they put on ads.  I would have a big ad for the F word on the side of a bus.  I could care less.  There are some times that you're driving, you pull up next to a bus and see an ad and go,  holy jeez.  Like, I'm ready to hit the car in front of me because I'm looking at the girl on this ad.  Right.  Just breasts just about out to the nip point.  What about those jeez ads where the girl's on the old car seat and it looks like the  middle of the desert and it just basically says, F me?  Yeah.  That one was out by the Midtown Tunnel here in New York. 
[00:42:30]  It was a huge billboard of a girl sitting on a car seat, legs apart.  You could see her undies.  The hottest goddamn billboard ever.  But if you're going to be offended by something like wow, you're certainly going to be offended  by that.  They're selling jeans by saying, oh yeah, F this chick.  Yeah.  Bill Hicks has a great bit about that, how to sell soda and stuff and how he would have  an ad for soda.  Oh yeah, yeah.  And it's a picture of what a lady kind of just like with her hand down near, I forget 
[00:43:00]  exactly how the bit goes, down near her privates.  Yeah.  And it's very, you know, suggestive and all that and all it says in the ad is drink coke.  Drink coke.  Anyway, go ahead.  The ads were history by August 8th.  Even without the controversy, they were due to be replaced August 24th, August 21st.  Cheapos.  Sally tuned in for curiosity's sake and then tuned out the shock jocks. 
[00:43:30]  I was not impressed, said Sally, who favors jazz stations.  Oh, darn it.  We were trying to turn you around, Sally.  I thought we'd have them.  She prefers jazz.  No, that's, um, what?  Uh, it's a, it's a guy, Lawrence Sally.  Oh, Lawrence?  Yeah, that's his last name.  Lawrence Sally's the guy that got the young go-getter to tell him what wow meant.  I would bet money that Lawrence would enjoy, uh, you know, a pair of boobs driving home  from his, uh, little job.  Johnson, come in here immediately. 
[00:44:00]  You listen to those guys?  Well, yeah, boss, I find them funny.  I'm not impressed.  Sit with me.  We're going to listen to jazz all day.  Okay, boss.  Let's give me a Chuck Mangione block.  I, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Spiro Gyra.  I'm the ones.  Sit down, Johnson, and listen to Kenny G.  I think it's shock radio and rather juvenile, Sally said.  The county rejects ads for guns, liquor, and cigarettes, along with ads that are political 
[00:44:30]  or sexually explicit.  These are the first bus ads to be pulled since the county first started posting them last  year.  Nice!  Another first for our show.  The county won't lose any money by doing so, Sally said.  It has a $6.5 million three-year advertising contract with Viacom.  The producer of the radio program could not be reached for comment.  What happened, Rick?  You couldn't be reached?  I couldn't be reached.  Interesting.  Unreachable. 
[00:45:00]  Sally said the county had received only one other complaint about an ad.  It was an advertisement for the History Channel.  Had a picture of the founding fathers along with the phrase not found in most children's history books.  An image of Ben Franklin, for instance, was accompanied by the word womanizer.  Of course, we didn't pull that ad.  We had one comment from one person, and there was nothing offensive about it at all.  Okay.  All right.  Get this.  The History Channel puts out an ad.  It's got an image of the founding fathers and says things that most people don't know about the founding fathers. 
[00:45:30]  Ben Franklin, I guess, was a womanizer.  So it had Ben Franklin womanizer.  Watch the History Channel.  Learn more about Ben Franklin.  Somebody called up.  One person said they were offended.  They didn't pull the ad.  Are you trying to say we're more offensive than Ben Franklin?  Being a...  Whoa.  All right.  Hey, Mr. Sally, how do you feel about Socrates?  Whoa.  We're more offensive than Ben Franklin.  Maybe we'll end up on a $10 bill. 
[00:46:00]  All right.  He's an awesome dude and a womanizer.  Mr. Ben Franklin.  Great.  But they got one complaint for ours.  One complaint...  Complaint.  One complaint for the womanizing Ben Franklin.  Yeah.  But they pull our ad.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  There you go.  That's it.  His defense for the whole Ben Franklin thing is, well, of course we didn't pull that ad.  We had one comment from one person. 
[00:46:30]  All right.  So, one comment from one person of ours.  All right.  So, follow this.  So, now we're in two local newspapers up there, okay?  Yeah.  This is where it gets interesting.  It has hit the AP wire, Anthony.  The AP, which means every media outlet in America has what I'm about to read.  The Associated Press is news aides, pretty much.  It's the one that just spreads out and gives it to everybody. 
[00:47:00]  There it is.  There it is.  No one goes untouched with AP.  And already two stations in New York have read this story from AP.  Both local news stations in New York.  And now, what?  We got a call from Fox 5 News.  Fox 5 taping our first break here.  They're going to be running some of the audio when they report on this tonight on the 10 o'clock news.  All right.  It reads, when wow means more than holy cow. 
[00:47:30]  Coming up on the 10 o'clock news, these signs look harmless.  You know, I love when the news does that.  The big tease.  And coming up later, this wow didn't wow people in Westchester as they had to.  We talked with Lawrence Sally and his young go-getter, Mr. Johnson.  What does wow really mean?  We'll tell you.  You've seen them around town. 
[00:48:00]  You've seen them on buses, even in Times Square.  We'll tell you one town that wanted no part of wow.  Is there an offensive billboard in your neck of the woods?  Wait, wait.  Why?  I couldn't say that?  No, you can't say that.  At least it doesn't say the C word.  You had to dump out of that?  Yeah, yeah.  I thought I could say that.  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  Do you know what your children are reading on the way to school?  It might look harmless enough. 
[00:48:30]  Wow kills.  Anyway, here's the AP story.  When wow means more than holy cow.  Westchester County officials pulled an ad for a radio show from 40 county buses last week.  Once they figured out what it meant, the posters for the Opie and Anthony show on WNAW in New York  were dominated by the word wow and seemed innocent.  But County Transportation Commissioner Lauren Sally says a couple of residents complained.  The commissioner learned that to listeners of the Opie and Anthony show, 
[00:49:00]  WoW stands for Whip Them Out Wednesday and is supposed to urge women to bear their breasts.  Mm-hmm.  Sally says that's offensive and exploitative of women.  Rick Delgado, producer of the radio program, declined to comment.  What did they call you?  Why are they calling you?  Rick.  Last night.  After our Hooters mess?  After?  No, no.  It was just before I got down to Hooters.  I was sending out stuff to a couple of our affiliates. 
[00:49:30]  It's too bad they didn't get us after the Hooters mess.  We would have had a lot of comments.  Yeah.  So now the story is spreading like wildfire all over the place.  And we couldn't be happier.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  This is News 12 in Westchester.  We're calling you guys because all the county officials who...  Rob?  Yeah.  I didn't hear what you said.  Where are you from?  News 12 in Westchester.  But listen, let me tell you why we're calling you.  Yeah. 
[00:50:00]  We're calling you because all these county officials that go on our air every day  refuse to talk to us about this.  They do.  We're going to you guys.  All right.  And will you be doing a story on this tonight?  Yes, we will.  In between the pet report?  We'll get it on.  I think Rob's their go-getter.  Are you one of their reporters, Rob?  Mr. Sally...  Yeah, I'm a reporter.  Mr. Sally and his young go-getter refused to talk to us.  They did, did they?  Yes, they did. 
[00:50:30]  See, they don't want this blowing up into some big story.  Hey, Rob.  Yeah?  Here's the real deal.  We don't give a flying F what you guys do with this.  Right.  Just make sure when you show the video of the WOW billboard,  it's nice and big on the TV screen.  Well, we got it right now on the phone when it says  Opie and Anthony, a NEW radio host,  and we have the WOW bumper sticker right up on the screen.  That's it.  And we went out and we got some WOW stickers on cars.  See, this is what's so funny about this type of crap.  Like, you know, the bus sign's all over northern Westchester, okay? 
[00:51:00]  And people check them out.  Not everyone, though, okay?  Now, these do-gooders think they're helping out the whole community  and they're getting rid of all the WOW billboards, right?  Yep.  It creates a controversy.  Now you've got news organizations and TV stations calling up Opie and Anthony,  and now it's all over their news reports.  What is that doing?  People that never would have known what WOW meant,  now will read the paper and know what it meant.  They'll watch TV and know what it meant.  So it's better than having the bus signs out there. 
[00:51:30]  These people are stupid.  If you don't like something, just let it go away.  Don't draw attention to it.  You're just making it bigger.  No, they've got to make it look like they're doing the right thing,  that they're being politically correct and defending and helping their constituency.  Of course they are.  We're going to be all over the news tonight, all over the place.  Is this live on TV right now?  This is not live.  No, we're taping it.  Thank God.  I guess a lot of people will be tuning in to your show now.  Of course they will.  Are you going to run this before or after the local farm report? 
[00:52:00]  We don't have a local farm report.  You're taping it on a top-load VCR?  No?  No.  You got all the ModRent equipment?  Hey, Rob, you know you want to laugh.  Come on.  No, I'm laughing.  I listen to you guys.  All right, good.  Cool.  All right, what else do you need to know, Rob?  I wanted to come down and be on the show,  but they said that you guys didn't want to do it.  You want to bring a camera crew and stuff?  Yeah.  It's just, you know what it is?  It's a pain in the ass to do a show when camera crews are in here. 
[00:52:30]  All right, you're tight.  Yeah.  Hey, did you type the news tease yet?  I'm not sure.  I think they're just going to run a little piece on it for five,  and then we'll have you guys on for, well, maybe we'll have you on for five, too,  but then we'll have you on again at ten.  What's the guy going to say?  Wow, what does it mean?  We'll tell you next.  The big tease.  Well, I think the most interesting thing about the story is what you said before  is that one caller complained, and then it was yanked.  One caller.  See that?  What about all the other people in the community that enjoy our show, 
[00:53:00]  enjoy the advertising?  True.  And don't find it offensive in any way.  I hate these do-goods.  I think they know what they're doing for everyone else.  Here's my statement, Rob.  Okay.  We are now living in a society that is worse than it was in the McCarthy communist days  with communism, because if you're perceived as being sexist or racist or homophobic  by doing things that you would do on a humorous show like this, 
[00:53:30]  all done with caring and love,  it's worse than it was in the old days with the communists.  You're perceived that way, and people are so scared that by one phone call,  you'll pull an entire ad campaign,  because they're afraid to be lumped in that they are supporting,  oh my God, women's breasts.  Eek! Eek!  And Rob, I don't want to be left out,  because what Ann said was really, really good, 
[00:54:00]  so if you could just add this at the end for me,  just so I'm a part of this.  Sure.  Opie says, your mom's box.  Closing words, famous closing words on this show.  What do you guys think about the county officials not knowing what wow meant?  They knew.  They're backpedaling.  They honestly thought that the bus sign said,  wow, listen, Topey and Anthony?  That would be some lame campaign that a radio station would run, though,  when you think about it.  Wow, listen to these guys.  Three to seven.  Wow! 
[00:54:30]  You know, it is kind of dopey like that.  But, they just had to react to one email.  All right, Rob, we're done with you.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  There goes Rob.  Now someone's got to watch us on, what?  News 12.  News 12.  Westchester.  Westchester, 5 o'clock.  We'll even run the...  5 and 10.

[00:55:30]  And we want to talk about Blind Matt's junk.  Do we have to?  Yeah, because we were laughing really hard in the back office about it.  It's just another example of how God is just a cruel bastard.  We'll get into it next.  Hello, this is Newman.  And you're listening to Opie and Anthony.

What car company cares enough about your safety to put full-time all-wheel drive on every car they make?  I'll give you a second to think about it.  Okay, time's up.  The answer is Subaru.  You see, every Subaru comes standard with full-time all-wheel drive.  The system that can help you avoid accidents altogether, thanks to great handling, incredible traction, and control. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, sure, some of the other guys may offer all-wheel drive, but it's not always standard, and it's not on every car.  Plus, our all-wheel drive is always on.  No buttons to push, no switches to flip.  It senses changing road conditions and automatically transfers power from the wheels that slip to the wheels that grip.  So, in challenging conditions, rain, sleet, snow, wet leaves, or loose gravel, you can take control in a Subaru.  So, why not put us to the test? 
[01:03:30]  Stop by your Subaru dealer and test drive the Outback, Forester, Legacy, and Impreza.  Subaru, the beauty of all-wheel drive.

[01:05:30]  Get in.  Jim Brewer in the studio.  Yeah.  Hoping.  He's got his TV haircut.  TV is my summer haircut, man.  TV haircut.  If I could quickly touch on something West Coast Dave just sent.  Sure.  It's hysterical.  A little link.  We love Japan as Americans.  We love what they're doing over there.  It's always pretty wacky.  You ever see the reality shows over there? 
[01:06:00]  They almost kill each other.  Japs are crazy.  They're crazy.  They have a video game that's a big hit right now over in Japan.  It's called Boonga Boonga.  The player standing in front of this video game console that is shaped like a woman bending over.  And it's got the rear facing you and a video screen with a little handheld handle device.  The object to cram a plastic finger up a virtual woman's dot steam bear. 
[01:06:30]  The harder you shove, the more reaction you get from the computerized face on the screen.  So you work the finger and the face makes like...  Makes faces.  That can't be real, is it?  And walking around these games is the mascots.  One is a giant finger.  Kaboonga!  The other one appears to be dressed with fecal matter. 
[01:07:00]  Kaboonga!  That's just some of the latest things coming out of Japan these days.  Kaboonga!  Boonga Boonga!  Anthony?  Kaboonga!  I have an update on the controversy we have created.  Started in a tiny little newspaper in northwest Chester.  Yep.  Our wow...  Our wow advertisements taken off...  Attention, attention, people of west Chester County!  Opie and Anthony!  Oh my God! 
[01:07:30]  Here they come!  Run for your lives!  Run for your lives!  Look out, Dick!  Proceed to the fallout shelters.  Duck and cover!  Duck and cover!  Good Johnny!  The AP picked up on the story?  Yeah.  We're just, you know, rehashing this for people just tuning in.  We just did an exclusive interview with News 12 of northwest Chester County.  Opie, we didn't do an exclusive interview.  We'll do one with anyone.  We don't care.  But Jazz from West Chester writes, 
[01:08:00]  Hey, I remember last year News 12 ran the same story of a wedding dress store burning down every day for about three months.  Congratulations!  You guys finally made it.  Meaning there's nothing going on at that station.  NHD.  So the local news stations in New York, they've picked up on the story.  They're talking about it.  Channel 5, 10 o'clock news, they're doing something on it.  Channel 9 sending a crew down, they're doing something on it.  Whatever happened to getting high and playing with your yo-yo? 
[01:08:30]  I don't know.  Just to spend time.  People just don't want to do it anymore.  You know what I mean?  To waste a little time?  Waste a little time.  Enjoy yourself.  Oh, and that's just in it.  Yes.  Tom Bronco, NBC Nightly News.  Controversy sweeping New York.  As a whip-a-mouth Wednesday.  Tom, it's whip-a-mouth Wednesday. 
[01:09:00]  Whip-a-mouth Wednesday.  Whip-a-wip.  Offending, well, in the ones of people.  People have kind of numbering it well into the single digits.  And Westchester, though holding steadfast to not taking the billboards down, backed off in a matter of seconds.  Tom Brogan, NBC Nightly News.  Because I, for one, have not seen any rust. 
[01:09:30]  Even though I do have a wow stick on the back of my limo, limo, limo, limo-zina.  Big Continental.  It is on the back of my big Continental that takes me into work every day.  Here I go.  Let me see if this works.  Katie Couric, show me your fun bag.  Show them to me, Tom Brogan, NBC Nightly News.  Tom, you seem kind of out of it today.  You all right? 
[01:10:00]  I'm quite woozy today.  If you notice on my reports, I'm usually falling asleep.  And I can't pronounce L's.  I did go to your magazine signing at Hooters last night.  I got in a beer fight and I was thrown out of Hooters and ended up in a bed in the Park  of Meridian watching Spanx Revision.  Tom Brogan, NBC Nightly News.  On a related story, blind people, bigger junk, you decide. 
[01:10:30]  As we have blind Matt come in and pull out his junk.  Come on, Al Walker, show us your cans.  Let me go to Dennis.  Dennis, what's going on?  Yeah, I just heard the tease on News 12 Westchester.  Yeah.  It says local DJ infatuated Olsen twins.  Yeah, right. 
[01:11:00]  That's all that guy heard.  That's all he heard.  That's all he heard was blah, blah, blah, blah, Olsen twins.  That seems to be what happens.  All right, man.  Take care, guys.  Thank you.  Stupid Time Magazine.  Hey, get sneaky in here.  We've got to talk about blind Matt's junk.  Blind Matt's junk.  This is definitely going to sound a little gay.  I understand that.  Are we safe?  Yeah, we're pretty safe here.  Let me tell you a little bit about what happened.  We had our blind boxing competition where we had two blind guys come here and just beat 
[01:11:30]  the living crap out of each other.  And it was funny because they were just...  This guy broke his ribs.  Yeah.  They were punched.  He said his puffy spleen was sticking out.  Puffing through his ribs.  Right.  He was hit so hard.  And a bruised kidney.  But to watch blind people box.  He's got a great story.  Yeah.  And to watch blind people box is just a treat, let me tell you.  So we had them come in yesterday for their special treat for helping us out with blind  boxing.  We were going to give them a lap dance, and we did.  Girls from Privilege came down. 
[01:12:00]  Five hot girls, completely naked, just going to town on these guys.  So at one point, blind Matt, who doesn't have eyes, he's got glass eyes.  He pops them out.  Pops them out.  That's a great party trick, man.  He's on the couch.  That's a buzz kill.  Pops the eyes out.  That's a buzz kill.  That makes me go into aliens and everything.  I'd trip harder.  Dude, give me a shotgun through your eye socket, all right?  No, we could pass through the sinus.  I did science.  He's got no eyes.  Guy knows how to party, though.  He was a trooper last night at Hooters. 
[01:12:30]  Well, you know what happened?  They're laying down on the couch.  Well, they're sitting on the couch.  The girls are all over him.  They start getting, they're starting to feel the excitement of the, uh, they, they saw  it first.  That was the big deal.  Well, no, no.  I mean, the guys themselves were starting to get the feeling of excitement about the  whole thing.  Gotcha.  You know what I mean?  Gotcha.  And now the girls see, see what's going on with Matt, with blind Matt.  And we just hear him now going, oh my God, look at that. 
[01:13:00]  He's packing.  And we've seen a lot of strippers, I've never seen a stripper get truly excited.  They'll fake the excitement and all that crap.  These girls were losing their minds.  They were losing their minds.  They had to, uh, they had to pull it out.  They had to pull it out.  He's sitting on the couch, the blind guy, they pulled his donkey out.  Whish.  Oh.  Whish.  Oh.  Whish.  Oh.  Whish.  Oh.  Whish.  Oh.  Whish.  Exactly.  Oh my God.  Whish.  Oh. 
[01:13:30]  So, uh, yeah.  This monster falls out.  I mean, we all saw it.  It was right there.  Do we have, um, do we have audio of exactly when it happened?  And, uh, yeah, we do?  All right.  Wow.  That is a monster.  How about that?  Yeah. 
[01:14:00]  Godzilla, always funny.  Yeah.  So we're talking in the back office and we're saying, how, how cruel can God be?  Here's a guy, he's blind and he's packing a monster and he has no effing clue because  he has nothing to compare it to.  He has no idea how big his junk is.  The only way.  We should have him describe what is, what is something, yeah, what does he think of, man?  The only way he could judge other guys' size is to grab it.  Oh.  And he hasn't done that.  So he doesn't know.  He thinks he's sporting like the average, I guess. 
[01:14:30]  He thinks everyone has a monster.  Everyone's sporting this, right?  Everyone's sporting this one, right?  Hey, guys, what about this?  What are we doing with this?  Yeah.  Oh, my goodness.  Is that your third leg?  Yes.  With a chick, you know, it's like I'm blind and I'm not sure if I'm inadequate here or  not.  And just, the proverbial sound that a sack of potatoes makes when you drop it on the floor.  This should be okay.  I hope it's not too inadequate. 
[01:15:00]  I think we were just overtired from looters because we were laughing our asses off in the  back office.  We're like, it's too funny how cruel this is.  But when he plays with his yo-yo, what I'm saying, we have visual and we, oh, yeah.  Yeah.  What does he think of?  I guess he's thinking of what it feels like.  Like, you know, the feeling of a chick.  I don't know.  I don't know what blind people that I've never seen before fantasize about when they  Jay, you know, cranking it.  He had the snicker bar in his pocket right away. 
[01:15:30]  Like, you know.  The snicker bar.  The movie theater size.  Yeah, exactly.  Before they even got naked, he was already.  Is that a huge one they give you?  King size.  Yeah, and then one of the dancers was so hot on this, she jumps on him and just starts  gyrating.  Like crazy.  She lost it.  Completely lost it.  Like a carnival ride.  There he is.  Blind Matt.  What's up, guys?  Hey, man.  You guys are awesome.  You're killing me over here. 
[01:16:00]  Well, you're the guy with the huge junk.  You've got a monster in your pants.  We just want to know, do you know that?  And how would you know that?  I've only heard the screams.  That's how I was doing it.  Yeah, is it, um...  So women have told you, right?  I've heard that, yeah.  All right.  But you don't know what other guys' size is, right?  No, absolutely no.  Yeah, because you'd have to grab on.  Absolutely.  That's a definite negative on that one.  Yeah.  But, I mean, it's just funny to hear this.  I mean, I didn't realize the whole, you know, being caught up in the moment. 
[01:16:30]  I really didn't realize the...  The whole damn thing just fell out of your pants.  You guys are too much, man.  Too much.  You getting home all right last night?  Oh, yeah, dude.  What a funny...  We got on, like, a certain train, and, like, my buddy and I both passed out.  We missed our connection train in Babylon.  Matt was so hammered, he could see.  Yeah, exactly.  My eyes were bloodshot this morning.  Does your dog, like, treat you differently when you just get hammered? 
[01:17:00]  Like, oh, I got to deal with a really drunk guy tonight.  No, I'll tell you, dude.  Like, his guide dog's all pissed.  That's funny.  Oh, you idiot.  It's like, oh, God.  He's staggering.  Man!  He's staggering behind me.  He's not keeping up.  I'll be nice to him, but that last step into the house, I'm not going to alert him to that.  That's it.  You could fall right on your face, funny man.  I'll tell you, though.  Every five years.  It's actually, it's a benefit because, you know, the dog has a good memory. 
[01:17:30]  So, like, when I used to live in the city, my first dog used to get me home, and I'd wake  up in the morning, like, how did I get here?  Oh, your dog knocked out again.  I thought a good memory, he'd tell you what you did last night.  Well, that, too.  Remember that chick?  The two of yous have piles of crap right next to each other.  What a night, huh?  Where'd that come from, man?  What a night.  But, man, I had a great time at Hooters, man.  You guys are a blast.  Oh, cool.  Hold on a second.  Mary wants to say hi.  Mary.  Yeah.  You're on with Blind Matt.  Hey, I didn't hear yesterday's show, and I wanted to tell you guys I wanted Blind Matt's 
[01:18:00]  number now.  Oh.  You like large mules?  I don't care what anybody says.  Size definitely matters.  Ah, there you go.  See all you little sweet guys?  But you have to be woman enough to handle it, you know.  That's true.  Believe me.  I've heard, uh, I've heard that.  Really?  You ever bottom out?  Uh, yes.  You bottom out?  Really? 
[01:18:30]  It's like taking the old Chevy Nova over the whoop-dee-doo, man.  Those shots ain't gonna handle it.  You know what I mean?  Bam!  Ow!  That is funny you say that.  I've never heard that bottom out.  There was a girl in Buffalo.  I hit the back wall.  You bottom out?  There you go.  I'm like, wait a minute.  You hear a little squeal from her, and then you get that heebie-jeebie feeling like, what  did I just hit?  What did I just hit?  Uh, Howard's on line four, whoo-hoo-hoo.  Let's see.  He wants to talk to Blind Matt.  Howard.  Yeah.  Yeah, I had a question for Blind Matt. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, Blind Matt.  Yep.  Yeah, I was wondering if you'd trade my eyesight for your junk.  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  Yeah.  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  No, I'm happy as is.  All right.  Hoo-hoo.  We've got a bunch of idiots that listen to us.  I couldn't be happier.  All right, Matt.  That's it.  Thanks, guys, and we'll see you soon, man.  See you soon?  Amazing.  How about that?  I didn't even realize that.  You're a blind guy humor.  Are you holding the phone with your junk right now, man?  Wrapped around twice.  Like a python. 
[01:19:30]  Did you make it into work today?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  At what time?  Normal time.  Nine o'clock.  Do you have different glass eyes that are blood shots, and when you're hung over, you  just pop those in, just so everyone knows how you're feeling?  No.  Wouldn't that be great?  You pop in, you're there.  Or just occasionally, you pop in a pink eye one and go, no, don't come here.  I could.  Yeah.  Got conjunctivitis, son.  I could turn them both white.  Not the pink eye.  Kind of like the big ones that look like cat's eyes.  You go, no, I'm a vampire.  I don't know what happened.  Kind of like the guy that has the two different toupees, and he wants everyone to think that 
[01:20:00]  he just got a haircut.  He's got a haircut.  He's got the long one and the short one, and then one day he'll just come in with the  short one, and he'll go, hey, Bob, you get a haircut?  Yeah.  That's clever.  And they switch back to the long toupee when they go on vacation, hoping that, you know,  well, a week went by, sure, he could have grown out that much.  That's almost as good as one of them old dirty schemes or angel schemes.  Hey, Matt, do you have one blue one and one brown one like a mongrel dog?  No, but I used to, you know, when I was growing up, you know, your head grows, so you have to 
[01:20:30]  get new eyes, you know, from time to time.  So I used to have, like, hazel kind of, like, Joe Namath color kind of eyes, but now I went  back to my natural brown.  Natural brown?  Yeah, natural.  Natural brown.  Well, you know what I was born with.  Right.  It was good, though.  He could fall asleep anywhere, and no one would know it.  Except for the jaw hanging open and the drool on the collar, but other than that, yeah.  All right.  Well, thank you, Matt.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  I get lenses that look like... 
[01:21:00]  I did, man.  You guys suck, and we'll see you soon.  I get lenses that look like the old comic book x-ray specs, and walk around looking at  girls going, yeah, yeah.  You know, the spirals?  Remember the little x-ray specs?  Yeah.  X-ray specs.  There he goes.  Blimey, Matt.  Bottom of the head.  A red eye.  A red eye.  Keep away, man.  Watch it, man.  I got the pink eye.  You don't want to get near this.  Yeah, it sucks.  I got it from a whore. 
[01:21:30]  You freaking whore.  Doug from Springfield doesn't know what bottoming out is?  Please.  We don't even have to explain it.  Yeah, I think everyone knows what bottoming out is.  If you don't, Doug, ha-ha.  Because there's only one reason you don't know what it is.  Can't reach.  Here he is.  We should take a break, huh?  All right.  We got to get into Marilyn Manson. 
[01:22:00]  Well, don't put it that way.  Well, true.  He tried to get into somebody.  Oh, we'll get into it next.  You haven't heard what Marilyn Manson is accused of doing?  No.  He's up on...  I asked him once.  I actually met that dude.  Yeah, we saw him backstage up in Boston.  And the guy is like...  He's all business.  Yeah.  He's the business guy.  How are you doing?  He knows the deal.  But then he gets out on stage.  And now he's up on sexual assault charges.  Just wait to hear what he did, man.

[01:33:30]  Let's do it tomorrow.  I'm going to wear glasses.  And we're back with the O&A Show.  I can't believe Brewer didn't hear what Marilyn Manson did. 
[01:34:00]  Let me hear this.  Let me hear this.  I, I, I...  Classic.  All right, let me read it.  Let me read for the newspaper.  Marilyn Manson in concert interlude.  He's up on charges.  Sorry, Anthony.  Yes.  Uh, satanic shock rocker Marilyn Manson yesterday was charged with sexually assaulting a male security guard during one of his concerts. 
[01:34:30]  What a shocker!  I'm shocked!  Oh my God!  Are you kidding?  He has...  He's, he goes that way?  He, uh, who knows?  Oh my God!  This is nuts!  Shocking.  Wait, wait, wait.  I gotta hear the rest.  I gotta hear the rest.  I gotta hear the rest.  I gotta hear the rest.  This is crazy.  Assaulting a male security guard during one of his concerts in what prosecutors call the disgusting display of perversion.  So it's a male security guard. 
[01:35:00]  Wait, a male security guard, but what'd he do?  He's gonna die.  The outrageous singer, dressed in a G-string, first approached Joshua from behind while rubbing his own area.  That's right.  So he's rubbing his donkey.  Right.  Walking toward the security guard in his G-string.  Conjures up some image right there.  As the theme Jaws goes on.  He's trying to do his job.  I'm back for a topper.  You stand back! 
[01:35:30]  Back up!  So he's, uh, he's, uh, he's, uh, walking toward the security guard, rubbing his own junk, okay?  Then he spit on the guy's head.  Spit on his head.  Oh, that old gag.  Isn't that a good one?  Spit on his head.  Like he, uh, da-da-da-da-da-da.  Where am I?  Then he spit on, okay, his head.  Wrapped his legs.  Wrapped his legs around the guard's body. 
[01:36:00]  and rubbed his blank area.  His, his, oh, he, wait, he gave the guard a reach around?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  All right, so he spit on the guy's head.  Spits on his head, wrapped his legs around the guard's body  and rubbed his donkey junk on the guy's head and neck.  Oh, oh, okay.  Oh.  He gives him a little prison loop.  This guy literally is one gene from a monkey.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:36:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  He was humping the guy's head.  I know what he did.  He did crap on the floor and threw his feces.  Da-da-da-da-da.  Prison lube, it's called.  Oh, man.  You know, when you give him the old...  So he jumped.  Ooh.  Ooh.  All right, calm down, Marco.  That's some serious...  The incident was witnessed by thousands of wild-eyed Manson fans in Michigan  who cheered in delight, assuming...  Hey! 
[01:37:00]  Assuming it was just another part of the bizarro musician's provocative act.  Manson, a.k.a. 32-year-old Brian Warner, was charged with criminal sexual conduct and  assault and battery.  God bless America.  Can you believe that?  He spits on his head and starts rubbing his junk in the spit on the back of his head and  his neck.  Get that wow sign off the bus now!  Now? 
[01:37:30]  Where you going, sweetheart?  Going to Marilyn Manson, ma.  Have a good time.  Get that wow sign off that goddamn bus now!  And stop throwing rocks at my car, you little crapper!  I know you're...  That's what they probably say.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Okay.  The prosecutor said the July 30th assault at this theater far exceeded any freedom of 
[01:38:00]  expression or artistic license.  No.  No S.  When another man is rubbing his junk on your head and neck using his own spit as lubricant.  I should have auditioned Sinai Live like that.  Yeah.  Jim, you're next.  Hey, Lauren.  Can you get his donkey out of my head?  What are you doing, Jim?  That's sick, man.  How about a hot pocket?  It's a great way to get a job, though. 
[01:38:30]  We need a stock boy.  Security guard.  So this guy must be filing some kind of a lawsuit, I'm sure.  Yeah.  How do you do that?  That's worth at least 30 mil.  And then, of course, according to the paper, Marilyn Manson could spend the rest of his  life in jail.  Yeah.  I hate when they had that.  I don't think in this case, but like 10 years in jail.  I know.  The Sopranos child, he may be booked away for 30 years.  Yeah. 
[01:39:00]  He could draw a 30-year jail sentence from this or just public service for 100 hours.  How funny.  Marilyn Manson trying to give this guy the Roman war helmet.  The Roman war helmet?  Do you think he was trying to give him the Roman war helmet?  That's exactly what he was doing.  What a great move.  Hey, it was up in the head and neck region.  He was doing.  He was going for the helmet.  I was injured about my head and neck.  It would have been...  All over my neck.  He comes walking out on the stage.  Dun-dun-dun-dun.  Dun-dun.  It's a great opening, man.  War helmet. 
[01:39:30]  Andrew.  Yeah.  How you doing?  Good.  Hey, Brewer, don't laugh.  That's the same thing that happened to you when you got the massage.  Don't you love how the listeners forget?  I got mad for a quarter of a second, but damn, that was funny.  They never forget.  It's great.  Yeah.  The massage episode.  See, that's what keeps you normal.  All right.  Man, friends say man's in my sleep.  What's happening to you when you do a massage?  Good.  Same thing.  What?  Line seven.  Which line here?  Over here?  Okay.  Let's go to Pete.  Pete, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:40:00]  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Listen, my friend went to the concert last week, to the Oz Fest, and he did the exact  same thing.  And my friend said it was definitely part of the show.  Ah.  He said it was the guard just stood there, staring straight ahead, and he was all into  it at the Oz Fest over here.  Oh, so it's like some kind of a bit for the, uh...  Part of the show, but maybe this guard didn't like it too much.  No, I was thinking what you were saying.  Maybe the guard is part of the show.  Maybe he did the wrong guard.  Maybe he did the wrong guard. 
[01:40:30]  He did the wrong guard.  What's he doing?  What's he doing?  He's a brewer.  Yeah?  Brewer.  What?  Later, faggot.  That's disgusting.  That Three's Company episode, where somebody is supposed to be somewhere, and they don't  show up, and...  Tonight on Three's Company...  Jack is standing in as security guard for the...  Marilyn Manson...  ...gives the Roman candle to the wrong security guard.  Wah, wah.  Laugh along as Jack Tripper poses as the security guard. 
[01:41:00]  Yay, what was his friend's name?  Remember the...  The swinger guy?  Larry.  Larry, that's right.  Larry, trying to make some extra money with Marilyn Manson, agreed to be a security guard  that Marilyn Manson would hump with his own spit.  But he couldn't make it because he got a hot date with some real old woman that seemed  to be every woman on that show that they were going out with.  Hey, hey.  Here we go.  Join us tonight for Three's Company when Jack Tripper gets humped by Marilyn Manson. 
[01:41:30]  Ooh.  Ha, ha, ha.  Come and knock on the door.  Come and spit on my head.  Larry couldn't make it.  He's busy banging Mr. Furley.  Look what I did to you.  Again.  Ooh.  Laughs ensue as Jack gets raped by the entire band.  Watch Pat Smear's money shot. 
[01:42:00]  Ha, ha, ha.  Kidney punches all around.  And it all finishes off as Mrs. Roper gets the Roman War helmet in her moo-moo.  Ha, ha, ha.  And she finally gets what she was asking for.  Ha, ha, ha.  Wah, wah, wah.  Ah, yeah, sure.  There you have it.  Let's go to Cleveland.  Tim, what's up today?  Hey, O&A, man.  You guys rock.  Thank you.  I want to ask Brewer. 
[01:42:30]  First of all, Brewer, man, you were hilarious last night on Conan.  Oh, thanks.  Yeah.  F. John Goodman, F. Spanish Sesame Street.  And we're going out to support Jay either tonight or tomorrow night.  Very close.  And I was wondering when you're coming to Cleveland.  Sometime September, October, something like that?  Check the websites, www.jimbrewer.com.  But I'll definitely hit you right now.  No one knows how to spell Brewer.  B-R-E-U-E-R.  B-R-E-U-E-U.  All right.  F. Dave the Jew.  All right, Tim.  Thanks. 
[01:43:00]  The Jew.  F. Dave the Jew.  Okay.  Never floats your boat there, pally.  Hey.  Um, Jim.  What?  You have to tell your story.  Well, I felt bad for you.  Well, I was listening to you the other day.  You have no problem telling it?  No.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I was listening to you the other day.  I was driving my wife.  But we also had grandma in the car.  Oh, no.  So they all headed down to the Regal Beagle, where they met Marilyn Manson. 
[01:43:30]  Me and Dee are howling as Opie's like, yeah, I got caught playing.  And she went back to sleep, and I'm howling because I've been caught many times.  Ooh.  Yeah, Opie got caught recently spanking it by his girlfriend.  We rented Rush Hour because I never saw him when it was on Twitter.  But I couldn't call in.  I couldn't call in.  Well, I'll just refresh everyone's memory because at least I have someone on my side.  Come on.  Every guy has.  Yeah, but no one around here would admit it. 
[01:44:00]  Every guy has.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I have never been caught.  You are being sexually harassed from the moment you wake up in the morning by your chick.  I swear to you, I've never been caught.  Bro, this is the third time for me.  It's been at least three.  It always causes big fights.  She flips out.  Really?  She gets mad.  I thought she was asleep because I looked.  You start slowly.  You know what I mean?  And then you're like, well, I've got to get some friction going.  Well, what happened?  So I turn around.  She's on the couch.  I've got to get some friction going.  Well, at first, I was like, whoa, hey, look at this. 
[01:44:30]  This feels nice, you know?  That old cartoon.  Mmm.  Mmm.  And then.  So at first, you could be in the mode like, I don't want to be bothered.  Too much work, maybe.  And then the second you're getting into it, it's like, why am I not doing this all the  time?  Why am I not quitting my job and doing this full time?  So when it really started, you know, I started getting into her, I looked behind me to make  sure, you know, she's still asleep.  And she was asleep. 
[01:45:00]  But Lou, would you give her a little peek?  Would you give her the fish eye?  Oh, yeah.  I turned around.  Exactly.  Hold me with the fish eye.  Oh, wait a minute.  You got to understand.  You don't get into that.  She was two feet.  She was two feet behind me.  You're very quiet.  You get the quiet method.  Oh, yeah.  And now I got.  Very quiet.  Just the thumb movement.  You get the real quiet method.  Just thumb movement.  Just maybe like the inside right here, like the wrist area.  Yeah.  Thumb movement, light movement, and pressure with the pinky, ring, and middle finger.  So then I adjust the pillow.  I'm getting all set.  And I look behind me. 
[01:45:30]  I'm like, all right.  She's still asleep.  And now it's time to get down to business.  I guess I was shaking the whole room because she woke up.  Well, you know what happened?  No joke because we have, like, all these stupid things in my living room.  And some of the crap is shaking.  Well, what happens in this situation, it's sort of like going.  You know when you start drinking, you don't realize you're drinking, having a good time.  So you start talking like this.  Yo, I got to take your beat.  You see the Mets?  Why would you bring in Benitez?  He sucks.  He sucks.  So when you start getting into that thing, it takes over. 
[01:46:00]  You're getting into the zone.  You don't realize you're doing it right here.  Yeah.  So, Sammy, we got on the air the other day.  That's Chris Rock, by the way, that talks about the nobody's home jerk.  What does he say?  What does he say?  You get in the good nobody's home jerk.  Well, you know what's home.  You can go to town.  You can go to town.  You can do whatever you want in whatever room.  You can do the roast beef.  Don't matter.  So, uh... 
[01:46:30]  Nobody's home jerk.  So it turns out that...  Nobody's home.  He's a nobody home.  Scream if you want to.  You can play on a pinna.  It's a duck.  I don't care because nobody's home.  It's just me and the duck.  Nobody's home jerk. 
[01:47:00]  So, uh...  That is a good jerk.  When nobody's home.  The nobody's home jerk.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  I've been shaking in the bed like a crackhead.  But it's okay because nobody's home.  I've been putting pillows together.  Making it look like an ass.  And I've been doing the home jerk. 
[01:47:30]  I've been banging.  I've put up other pillows to make them watch.  Say, you're next.  I've put a satin pillow on a jerk.  I use every room in the house.  I don't care.  No one's home.  I'm doing it in front of the fridge.  On my donkey.  I'm going to get in a donkey bottle.  I'll kind of jerk.  I'm doing it in front of the TV. 
[01:48:00]  I'm doing it in front of the fridge.  I got pillows and how there is other than hungry.  Nobody home jerk.  All right.  All right.  Joe Rogan.  You ever hear that, dude?  Yeah.  He has a bit where he goes, the worst part about when you're playing, when you're doing the donkey,  is you're going to have a blood.  And always when you finish, it's always like, what's wrong with me? 
[01:48:30]  You got your tongue on it.  So what happened?  Nice head, dude.  Make a long story short.  I thought I was safe and, you know, did the thing.  It turns out when we got Sandy on the air, because she, I thought she caught me, but we  didn't really want to talk about it around the house.  That's what you're talking about.  So I figured I'd bring it up on the air where, you know, it's a little safer to discuss things 
[01:49:00]  openly.  And it turns out that she did open up her eyes during the whole thing, and she was scared  at what she was seeing, so she made believe she was sleeping for the rest of it.  So she has to sit there and make believe you're sleeping.  Good for her.  What to do.  What to do.  Hold on.  Jay wants in here.  He's in Cleveland tonight.  We're going to get to your story, my friend.  Jay, what's up?  What's up? 
[01:49:30]  I just heard Jim Brewer giggling.  That's what's up.  That's a party.  What's up, Jay?  What's up, Brewer?  When are we going out together, Hammer?  Soon.  I'm in Cleveland.  Your name on the answering machine said Jim Brewer.  I swear to God, I tore them a new a-hole.  It said Jim Brewer and John Tenet coming up.  So Jay, one time, I was staying at his house in L.A. years ago, and we're hanging out.  I went to sleep early.  Oh, no.  Do I need, in Jay's house, do I even need to say any more? 
[01:50:00]  And this is what I wake up.  You know when you're in that stress, you know, I'm leaving home and I'm in L.A.  Am I going to be on TV?  Am I going to be on movies?  Jay's like, Brewer, last time.  We going to Hell Brewer or no?  No, Jay, whatever.  Faggot.  You know, sit home, be a faggot.  All of a sudden, I'm passed out in a coma, and all of a sudden, I wake up to this thing  standing directly above me in dark.  It's like four in the morning.  Sergeant Brewer, what are you doing lying on my floor? 
[01:50:30]  Dude, I can't even tell you.  That was the most bugged out thing I've ever went through.  I'm like, Jay.  Private Brewer.  What is your major malfunction, Private Brewer?  Jay, what the F, man?  What are you doing?  You just got it home.  What's going on?  Who's Jay, soldier?  You must be drop your scene, grab your socks, screaming about a man named Jay.  You, too.  Keith Robinson was there.  You, too.  That's right.  That's right. 
[01:51:00]  Get off you and your butt, friend.  I want everything to clean, Brewer.  Brewer.  You know, like a drill sergeant will just read your name tag and kill you?  I didn't know if he was going to pop me.  No, I was just doing the guy from Full Metal Jackets.  Did you go out?  You go out?  No, me.  I was half in a coma.  No, I was just playing PlayStation, drinking beers and drinking scotch.  Jay got a good jerk on.  Hey, I got to tell you guys this.  And Brewer, this is good for you, too, buddy.  What's that?  What's that?  Five, when I say five, I mean like five people last night at one restaurant said, listen to 
[01:51:30]  you on O&A all the time.  When are they coming here?  Cole, Cleveland, some love.  You guys are blowing up.  Dina Cola mentioned Jim Rome when he went on stage, and they cheered.  And he goes, how about Opie and Anthony?  And I was out of the showroom, and I thought, I don't know, I was like, Dina Cola doesn't  get laughs like that.  Oh, that hurts.  The place erupted.  They're going, hey, I heard about the Philly Summit. 
[01:52:00]  When are they going to do it here?  When are they going to do it here?  They are rabid for you guys.  Yeah, we're feeling it from Cleveland, man.  It's cool.  This morning, I did radio.  Anyone's asking me, the only thing anybody wanted to talk about was the guy's blind lap  dance.  I'm like, money.  I wasn't there.  What do you want me to tell you?  He's blind.  He's got a monster in his pants.  Oh, Jay.  It's like a Jay Moore career.  What was the line?  Oh, I'm there, but you kind of really don't notice it.  That was great.  And people always come up to me like they're letting me know that someone clowned me and 
[01:52:30]  it's inside information.  I don't know if you know this, but somebody said it.  I was like, oh, that's funny.  Yeah, of course.  Not the reaction they expected.  Just showing the love.  It's the best.  The only reason I called is I cannot believe how huge you are in such a short amount of  time.  It's only been like four weeks there, I think.  Dude, four weeks, more weeks.  This town is ready for you to rock its age.  Yeah, we'll get out there, man.  We're going to do something.  I mean, I'm talking sooner than later.  Yeah.  We'll plan something in the fall then, man.  And if you got extra time during the breaks, Serena Williams playing Barbara Shett in this, 
[01:53:00]  and I already put like two maps of Hawaii into my carpet.  Serena Williams.  You know how I like McElroy used to put the ball in his pocket?  Yeah.  They just stick it under their panties up against their ass cheek.  Oh, I know.  We love that.  We love that.  Especially Serena, that dirty girl that needs me.  How hot would Serena be with that big ice cream scooper booty, and the father abused  her just enough to make the sex wild?  That's the kind of girl she'd be going on you, and then she'd just look you in the eye, 
[01:53:30]  just making sure she's doing the right thing by Papa.  Oh, God damn, you're sick.  I'm sick, but I haven't lied yet, as Red Fox said.  Now, Serena's a good jerk.  Not yet.  Where are you playing this weekend?  I'm not playing until September.  I don't start until September 5th.  Are you still filming?  Long Island.  Yeah, man.  Oh, awesome.  Hey, Jay, a bunch of people are calling saying I'm going to a Jay show tonight.  Where is it at again?  I don't want to plug.  No plug.  Oh, that means you sold out.  Plug it. 
[01:54:00]  You sold out.  Come on, where are you going to be?  That's the only reason you want to plug.  I just called to let you, I'm, I'm, don't forget how this started.  I'm doing recon for you guys.  But I'm asking you, where are you playing?  I'm at the Improv.  For the rest of the weekend.  All right, dude, we've got to take a break.  If you want to call it back, geez, how many times are you going to plug, Jay?  All right, man.  Hey, private breeder.  Ten mile hike.  Oh, remember that one, Jim?  Which one?  Which one?  Right now, we're going to go on and grab your seeds and drop your seeds and grab your socks.  We're going on a ten mile hike. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, it's always great to wake up, too.  Twenty miles!  Anybody else?  All right, guys, take care.  You suck.  Thank you, Jay.  You rock, man.  All right.  There you go.  Thank you, Jay.  We do have to take a break, and we'll get to Jim Brewer's J.O. story next.  You're not getting out of this.  You're not getting.  And if Channel 9 News shows up, they're going to have to wait, my friend.  Well, there's radio.  There's edgy.  There's psychotic.  And then there's O&M.  The Opie and Anthony Show.

[02:04:00]  Just tell us, where's your LK?  And then I found out my window, facing you, I could sit down, Annie.  Give me two on a mopping, with my face, on a carpet.  And then you ran into the bedroom, you were struck down, you were sawing.  Annie, you okay? You okay? You okay, Annie?  Annie, you okay? You okay? You okay, Annie?  Annie, you okay? You okay, Annie?  You've been hit by, you've been struck by a smooth criminal. 
[02:04:30]  Hey!  Friday!  Hey!  Friday!  Hey!  Friday!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  This is the O&A Show.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Jim Brewer sitting in today. He killed on Conan O'Brien last night.  Yes.  Have you heard that with Carolyn Ray? Was on before you?  Yeah.  And like Conan was...  Boy, I think Conan was a little taken with her. 
[02:05:00]  Well, she was showing her cannons, man.  She had two...  She has huge guns.  Cannons.  Yeah.  But there's a back to rock!  Those type of cannons.  Yeah, one of them, like, flew out.  Oh, it was incredible.  And I think Conan was a little taken with that.  Who was it?  That's disgusting!  Yes, Marco finds those disgusting.  Get that sticker off the bus now!  This is an outrage! 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, she was packing.  She had a red thing.  She's cute.  You know what?  I remember her from years of doing stand-up.  Yeah.  She's funny, too.  You know what?  She's a little punchy.  Wow.  Hold on, I gotta go to this guy real fast.  Chris!  Yeah?  What's up?  What's going on, Ope?  You tell me.  I'm waiting for it to come on.  They just, like, showed when they started up the news program.  Yeah.  County goofs when sexual ads are placed on county buses.  What?  This is the News 12 report they're doing in Northwest Chester.  Oh, is that what it is? 
[02:06:00]  I'm still waiting for it.  I'm still hearing about this fire they were talking about before.  So what was the tease?  What was the tease, yeah.  They were saying, now, West Chester County goofs by playing sexually explicit ads on county buses.  Goofs?  Yeah.  Goofs.  Goofs.  Oh, hoops!  You guys are goofy.  Hey, could you just record it?  Because we're going to talk about something, and then we'll go back to you?  I don't have a recorder with me.  Damn you!  Damn me.  Are they going to do the story next, you think?  I'm just waiting. 
[02:06:30]  You're a goof.  Oh, we can record here?  Yeah.  Of course.  Oh, look at us being on.  Oh, here it is.  Here it is.  Oh, hold on.  All right.  Turn it up.  All right.  All right.  Turn it up.  You have been pulled from 40 West Chester County buses following a single complaint.  Wow ads, similar to this bumper sticker, have been taken off the backs of the county  B-line buses.  Wow stands for Whip Them Out Wednesday at the WAW advertising campaign, which urges women  to expose their breath.  Now, radio personalities Opie and Anthony, who's to be 12 West Chester live on their program 
[02:07:00]  today.  DJ Anthony referred to the county's decision to pull the ads as censorship.  You're living in a society that is worse than it was in the McCarthy communist days.  Because if you're perceived as being sexist or racist or homophobic by doing things that  you would do on a humorous show like this, all done with caring and love, it's worse than 
[02:07:30]  it was in the old days.  While county officials refuse to comment on their decision to pull the ads off the buses,  we of course will have more on this story also on the new 12th night edition at the beginning.  Ed, you should have ended.  We got a bunch of dicks.  That's what I was going to say.  You should have said, now get out of my way, dick, dick.  Well, I think they're going to cut that part out.  That's so funny.  I love it.  You know what?  You know what?  I got to tell you something.  I do that on purpose because I try. 
[02:08:00]  It's like, oh yeah, it's just like the McCarthy communist thing in a nice way.  They bought that.  Brewer, I go, you know, I made a really good point.  I want to make sure I'm part of this piece tonight.  So could you add your mom's box for me?  You know what I'm going to do?  Let's, Opie, we got to have a contest.  Who could get the dumbest quote on these news shows?  Well, I'm in the lead.  This is like communism.  It's the goddamn commune. 
[02:08:30]  These seven bitches started coming in years ago, and I told you to open up your peepers, hot shot.  It's the goddamn Red Menace is what it is.  First, it was the Mexicans.  All right, guys, I got to run.  Hold on, Chris.  We're going to give you Jim Brewer's tickets, okay?  Cool.  For what show, Ben?  Vanderbilt.  Long Island?  Yeah, when is that date?  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  I think it's in September.  September 5th.  That's the first night.  Yeah, September 5th at the Vanderbilt on Long Island. 
[02:09:00]  Chris, you got some tickets.  Stay there.  We'll get your info.  That is hysterical.  If you're, like, a fan of the show, because we were goofing when we were seeing all that crap to the reporter,  and then they reported on their newscast as, like, really serious.  Because I said before, I have a serious statement to make.  Here's my statement.  It is worse than communism.  Communism.  They're taking dopey wow things off the back of Buzzers, and I'm equating it with the McCarthy-era communist witch hunts.  I'm going to start watching TV again. 
[02:09:30]  It's so funny.  This is interactive television for us.  Well, we're going to be on Fox 10 o'clock news.  Channel 9's coming down here.  Oh, yeah.  This thing is exploding.  It's so stupid.  Give me a quote.  What can I use?  It's like the extinction of the dinosaur.  I'll just pull things I watch on History Channel.  I don't care.  The news lady was all serious.  We will definitely have more on this.  More on this one.  This is a story we'll be watching.  It's developing. 
[02:10:00]  Still developing story.  No, it's not.  You'll have the same exact story at 11 o'clock.  Love it.  That's hysterical.  This is an outrage.  Oh, my tennis.  Wow.  It's always on the back of buses upsetting people.  Yeah, that was funny.  I like that.  Yeah.  All right, Brewer.  Wow.  Now, let's get back to the jail.  Oh, you're not off now.  Oh, come on, man.  We've passed that.  Now, I told my whole story, and you were listening in the car with your lovely...  See you later.  Your lovely wife. 
[02:10:30]  Make sure you write us in a week.  We'll come back, nation.  Grab on to the rap.  No.  By the way, someone taped the 10 o'clock news on 5 and 9 for us, and we'll go over that  on Monday.  Yeah.  So, you heard my getting caught story.  Why do you have to put your glasses on for this story?  Because it's embarrassing.  It assons me.  They don't want to look people in the eye when you're talking about being a filthy animal  like that.  Filthy animal to herself. 
[02:11:00]  Cranking it.  You know how embarrassed you feel the second it's all over.  So, you're in the car with your wife and your grandma listening to this crap.  Yeah, I'm listening, and I want to call, because I instantly started laughing.  Actually, Dee laughed even harder.  Because for...  I'm married eight years, man.  We've known each other a long time.  You do a lot of donkey playing.  A lot...  There's a lot of times when you do it.  Well, a couple times I almost got caught, and she'd have a talk with me. 
[02:11:30]  But a similar...  You look like your mom.  I'm dumb.  Now, you really got to stop doing that.  If you want it, just come to me.  Oh, right.  Okay.  Yeah, all right.  Hi, how are you doing?  Listen, can we do it right now?  Because, you know, I want to.  The time I got caught, the one big time, it turned into a big fight, because she turned...  First of all, you feel like a dick that you caught.  You feel like a dick.  There's nothing more humiliating. 
[02:12:00]  I will take stepping in human feces and bare feet.  Or, you're standing there naked with your donkey in your hand, and you have another human being, your wife, looking at you in disbelief, like, what is wrong with you?  Yeah.  So, I instantly took the defense, and I went, nothing.  I tried to play it.  Oh, no.  So, I went, nothing.  I'm just... 
[02:12:30]  Nothing.  And she's like, so, there's that weird barrier of, am I going to get away with this?  No.  Can we just drop this?  Because you really don't want to go to battle here.  You were dressed, though?  Like, you had something on?  No, no.  How did you cover up?  My pants were off.  How did you cover up, though?  I couldn't.  I just...  I jumped on the side of the bed.  I was next to the bed.  So, I leaned down, like I was trying to take a nap real quick.  I was napping.  I'm napping.  I was napping.  This is a lamer excuse than hoping. 
[02:13:00]  Well, you had no excuses, though.  Well, you got no excuses.  You said, well, how do you get out of this?  What are you doing?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Sleeping.  So, I lay down, and she's like...  So, there's that tense moment, like, please, you know what's going on.  She says, drop it.  Drop it.  All right?  Let's make believe this didn't happen, okay?  So, what...  And there's that weird moment, and she goes...  Are you playing with yourself?  Oh, no. 
[02:13:30]  That's not...  I'm really mad right now.  Oh, like you're not humiliated enough.  I'm really mad.  I go, why are you mad?  She goes, that really offends me.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  So, now...  You know, this is when you lose it.  Oh, no.  This is when you go, well, it shouldn't offend you.  Well, it does.  How does it feel?  I'm standing here in front of you.  Do I never give it to you?  I mean, how wrong is that?  And you feel the need that you have to hide on me and touch and play with yourself?  That's disturbing. 
[02:14:00]  Let's not forget you're naked as you're yelling at Jeff.  What is happening?  So, then I...  On his side, Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nothing.  And then, first you take the...  First, I took the argument of...  I attacked her like this.  I said, well, I didn't want to bother you!  Because you said you were tired last night because the baby got up early.  What did you say all day?  You got mad on me.  As soon as I woke up, you're like, I'm eating that today.  And I let you nap.  Did I not do that?  Yes. 
[02:14:30]  I did.  And I said, it looked really good.  And so, you said you were tired.  You went downstairs.  You said you were tired.  I thought you took a nap.  So, I started playing myself.  So, all right?  Is that all right with you?  I'm trying to help you out.  And you're making me feel like a dick.  It's so true.  You guys know what I'm talking about.  Yes, I do.  Oh, my God.  You try to spin it.  You try to spin it and get out of it.  Turn it around.  Oh, but my wife, she knows me.  Look, the only human being that's ever going to know you your entire life better than you  is your wife. 
[02:15:00]  And the reason you get so pissed at her is because she's so on and right.  But you don't want to face it.  So, she goes, you'd even think.  You know what?  I wouldn't be offended if you at least tried.  But you didn't try.  You just decided you're going to go up and play with yourself.  Why didn't you?  I'm very offended.  I'm not taking that route.  Yeah, when you're there yelling at your wife now, just sporting naked.  And you're sporting.  And you're just standing there now.  Like, is that pretty much takes you about five ticks down on the advantage scale? 
[02:15:30]  You know?  You're done.  You can't argue.  Going naked, bad.  And what sucks for me is I've got three.  I have weird room.  Oh, no.  It sounds worse than it is.  But there's three mirrors.  Yeah.  It sounds way worse than it is.  Trust me.  So, I've got two angles on me so I can see myself.  And then I realize this while I'm caught in the middle of this whole thing.  Were you able to pull covers over yourself?  Look at me.  I'm hot.  Oh, no.  I quickly.  Once we got over to the thing, I quickly put up my.  But now she's standing there as you're putting pants on. 
[02:16:00]  And look how hot I am.  God, is that horrible.  No, I can't look at myself.  I lose.  I'm like.  Oh, baby.  Baby, look in mirror three.  This reminds me of the dude, the American Psycho, when he's banging those two chicks.  But he's looking at himself in the mirror while he's flexing.  Flexing his thighs.  That's hilarious.  Huey Lewis and the News.  This is Susudia.  Phil Collins.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  There he is.  The color is bone. 
[02:16:30]  Bone.  With a font that I picked.  I love that movie.  You've got to tell the last part where she caught you in the.  Which one?  After you did the concert and all that.  And you were, you know, a little.  Which one?  I need better language here, Ope.  Help me out.  He's like, you know.  If you guys could see Ope right now.  He's just leaning his head to the right and going.  You know, when you.  That was my rehearsal for like, you know, being high. 
[02:17:00]  Like, being a little under the.  Oh, my God.  Like you got.  Then you got to deal with it.  Well.  When you were downstairs, like you said, jamming like Judas Priest or something.  Giving yourself a concert and then decided.  Whoa.  Oh, no.  Exactly.  Exactly.  When I got some spare time, you always revert back to being 16.  Always.  Yeah.  Like you're down.  You know, Chris Rock.  I'm a jacking.  You got to have a.

[02:18:00]  Now, this is what a living after midnight kind of jerk.  This is like jerking after midnight.  There we go.  Jerking after midnight.  Jerking till the dawn.  Till the morning.  Then I'm gone.  I'm gone.  So you're having a concert with yourself.  Jerking. 
[02:18:30]  Jerking.  Nice head, dick.  Here's a kid.  Jerking.  Jerking.  Wait, what's he say?  I come alive.  I come alive.  Yeah, he comes alive.  That's when my jerking goes all right.  At the midnight.  Jerking to the dawn.  Fuck it off, dick.  The volume better be down when you're jerking at the Judas Priest. 
[02:19:00]  You can't jerking if the music's too loud.  Jerking.  Jerking.  You're going to get come jerking if the music's too loud.  I put that big ball in my mouth.  And I start jerking like the gift.  And I put on it.  There's a message.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Back in.  From the dawn.  To the dawn. 
[02:19:30]  Let's go.  When I'm home alone, 95% of the time I spend jerking.  Oh, here we go.  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha.  I'm...  I'm a baby for you!  I'm a baby for you!  Wait, wait, wait...  I'm gonna blow you!  He's gonna blow you!  Perfect!  Wait, wait, wait...  This sounds good, one...  I'm...  Where you at today?  I'm a tiny?

[02:20:30]  And that's a good jerk.  Heavy metal jerk.  When you've been banging your head,  leather,  you're a snout kind of jerk.  We're talking love,  fight,  screaming for vengeance.  Leather,  rubber gags,  and zippers.  We're talking run to the hills,  master of puppets,

You were jamming  Judas Priest or something.  I can't get through this story.  That's fine.  You're kidding.  Ah, we get the image.  Just the visual 
[02:23:00]  of you coming downstairs.  The music's cracking.  You're high, naked.  Oh, dude.  I wasn't naked.  Was this before  or after that other episode?  Now, is this before  or after the other episode  you just talked about?  Oh, this is after.  Oh, man.  So she must have been like,  didn't we talk about this?  You have a problem.

When they probably  would have had 20  and the guy's  getting pissed off?  Check your register,  my friend.  I'll tell you that,  but most of the people  that he thought  he was offended  wouldn't have been  there in the first place.  You're in a place  called Hooters.  If you're taking  your kids to Hooters,  what's your problem? 
[02:38:30]  Kids shouldn't be  up at ten.  Right.  But he came up  and said,  you know,  there's some families  sitting at some  of those tables.  Meanwhile,  it's just packed  with O&A fans,  and believe me,  what we were saying  up on...  There's a family.  Where the hell  are the families?  Families.  I didn't see any families.  Some people that look  like the Manson family.  Do you have a high chair?  Yeah.  You need a booster seat  for Junior?  A booster seat.  Give him a booster seat  so he can get  a better look  at your ass  that's in the 
[02:39:00]  very short shorts.  Can we see  the kids' menu?  Where's the kids' menu  at Hooters?  What are they called?  Nubs?  The kids' menu.  We call it  nubs here at Hooters.  Nubby fingers.  Nubs.  Nubby nipples.  They weren't pissed,  were they?  I can't believe  they would be pissed.  Unbelievable.  But, you know,  I guess...  We spent a lot of money  in that joint,  and hey, man,  you spend that much money,  you're going to have to deal  with at least one beer fight.  Oh, man.  Now, so we're getting  people up,  and we're like,  you know,  and the Fox crew 
[02:39:30]  was there  for the O'Reilly factor.  They were taping  some stuff  from last night.  Now, you kicked out  or you're leaving?  Some people  were kicked out.  I left  before we got kicked out,  and it was pretty much  over by that point  because the management  was just fed up.  The upper portion  where we were doing  the signing,  the floor  completely covered  with beer.  Like, about a half  an inch of beer  over the entire floor.  Jim, at one point,  people were just  buying pitchers of beer  so they could pour it 
[02:40:00]  over people's heads.  It wasn't even like,  oh, well,  I'm kind of drunk  and I have a little beer left.  No, they were running  to the bar  to get full pitchers.  You were bringing out  the tribal in everyone.  Oh, man.  Who's directly responsible  for the beer fight?  Stinky, please, who?  Directly responsible  for starting the beer fight.  What'd you do, Stink?  People from Fox.  People from Fox.  Who in particular?  Who was it?  This person has called me  and asked me not to out them. 
[02:40:30]  All right, so she  started the beer fight.  Yes.  And that was right after  she gave Stinky Tongue.  Oh, Jesus.  Look, I don't know  what was happening there.  All I know is  at some point of the night,  I stand up.  She grabs a pint glass  of beer  and goes to pour it on me.  I go, no, no, no.  And Stinky and Ben are around  so they're grabbing  the beer away from her.  But there's so much beer  laying around  that she just kept  picking them up  until everyone else's  hands were full 
[02:41:00]  so they couldn't grab  any more beer from her.  She throws it right  at my crotch.  So now I'm standing  there with my crotch soaked.  So now I'm just like,  all right, you want to play?  We'll play.  I grabbed a pitcher.  There was a full pitcher  of beer  and dumped it  right over her head.  And then I follow up  with two pint glasses  of Guinness  at each boob.  I just flung it at her.  Then beer is flying  everywhere.  Bam, bam, bam, bam.  Let the games begin. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, it was.  Because all of us  that were stealing  the beers out of her hand  that she's trying  to dump them on Anthony,  now we've got all beers  on our hands  so we just like  followed Anthony's lead.  It's just like,  all right.  Everyone doused her.  She was soaked  head to toe  with beer.  And at that point,  the management  started getting pissed off.  Another place  we're not going to be able  to go back to.  That's all right.  The city's full of them.  Jim, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  This is Shet.  Remember I was talking to you?  Yeah.  You had a big guy  with a sister anyway  you were telling me about?  Yeah, we remember you.  All right. 
[02:42:00]  Before I got up to you guys,  one of the waitresses  come up to me and goes,  come on, move it, move it, move it.  I said, where the hell  do you want us to move?  We're online.  After I was talking to you,  I went to get OD's autograph.  Yeah.  The guy with the blue shirt  letting people in by you  goes, come on,  you got to leave.  So I thought,  it was because I was in there  too long talking to you.  He goes, no,  you got to leave the building.  Why?  I said, what the hell did I do?  The building?  He said, you have to leave.  What did he,  what reason did he give?  He said, finally,  he said, you grabbed  one of the girls.  I said, what girl? 
[02:42:30]  You know,  more people got thrown out  last night at the end  of the night  than ever before.  So I went over by way.  You know,  I met some friends there.  You know,  people like,  you know,  they're by myself.  I met some people.  So I said,  well,  I'm going to say goodbye  to my new friends.  He goes, no,  you're not.  I said,  what are you going to do?  Throw me out again?  I'm leaving now.  So I went over  and said goodbye  and I tried talking  to the owner,  the guy with the black shirt.  He says,  I got to listen to my girl.  So she says,  there you go.  So it was only about 8.30  right after 8.30.  Oh, my God. 
[02:43:00]  A lot happened.  8.30.  A lot happened after 8.30.  We do have to say  a couple of things.  In general,  everyone was well behaved.  It got crazy at the end.  Yeah.  Because, you know,  the beer fights.  Crazy at the end.  Yeah, the beer fights.  People that work for Fox.  Right.  The beer fights,  you know,  got a little crazy.  But I don't want people  to think it was  completely out of control  all night.  Secondly,  the waitresses were  absolutely awesome  at Hooters last night.  Oh, yeah.  The Waitresses rock, man.  They completely rocked.  Boy, I wonder if O'Reilly  would have liked  using some of that footage. 
[02:43:30]  That would have been great  if we would have had  some of that on tape.  Angel.  Yo!  Nice.  Oh, angry Angel.  Did you have fun,  angry Angel?  Oh, man.  You crackers  make party good, man.  What happened now?  The manager was pissed?  Yo. </pre>
