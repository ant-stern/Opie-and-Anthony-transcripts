<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a self-deprecating intro, followed by a home video of a profane argument between a father and son in Southie.  The hosts then played a pre-recorded segment and interviewed Pat from Unaki, a competitive eater, in the studio about his experiences, including his participation in a hot dog eating contest and his perspective on the IFOCE. This was followed by visual bits and impressions.

The show's main focus shifted to unedited, sexually explicit and profane voicemail messages allegedly left by Pat O'Brien. Opie and Anthony speculated on the context and  O'Brien's subsequent rehab, using voices and impressions throughout.  Detailed descriptions of the explicit content were given. The first half concluded with the hosts discussing their negative movie-going experiences, specifically disruptive audience members.

The second half heavily featured listener calls detailing horrific experiences at a Comac, Long Island multiplex. Callers described encounters with gun threats, pimps, gang members, and unruly families, often using racial slurs and stereotypes in their descriptions.  One caller recounted a confrontation with a disruptive Hispanic family; another described a Latin family openly discussing car theft; and yet another detailed a tense atmosphere at a Green Acres Mall screening of "A Time to Kill." The hosts discussed their own movie theater pet peeves (noisy eaters),  played a clip of their embarrassing first radio show, and engaged in a lengthy, graphic discussion of various "freakish birth defects" from news reports, including a "mermaid baby," a baby with a parasitic head, a man born without an anus, and a man with a split penis, using crude and offensive language.  Multiple callers shared their own bizarre and offensive anecdotes.

A retrospective segment featured a discussion of an earlier broadcast, approximately 11 years prior, alongside Jim Norton. They dissected the audio, highlighting chaotic banter, a recurring "ruling" bit, and their "assault on the media" campaign, which involved listeners disrupting news reports.  Richard Huff, a *Daily News* columnist who criticized their actions, was called into the show.  A surprisingly amicable conversation ensued, where they debated the ethics and impact of the campaign, touching upon media practices and the lines between news and entertainment. The segment also included a call from a listener, and a discussion and interview with Rich Voss about his disastrous eBay purchase of a Rolls Royce.

A segment focused on a discussion with Richard Huff, this time regarding a column criticizing the show's fans for disrupting Howard Stern's broadcasts.  They debated the level of disruption caused by fan actions,  with Opie and Anthony referring to their fans as "pests," "jerks," and "weasels."  The conversation then shifted to praising the TV show "Hit Me Baby One More Time," and a segment featuring listener-submitted remixes of comedian Bob Kelly breaking his knee. Finally, they discussed a news story about two refrigeration engineers suffering rectal injuries from a fire extinguisher during "horseplay," speculating about the incidentâ€™s nature.  The segment opened the lines for listeners to share similar experiences with fraternity hazing, frequently involving anuses.  Many of these calls were described as "gay" or "funny" by Opie and Anthony.

Another segment featured a call-in segment focusing on bizarre and sexually explicit anecdotes, primarily about fraternity hazing, including accounts of a goat, donuts on genitals, the "Atomic Sit-Up," "the elephant walk," masturbating a dog/masturbated hat, towels and cucumbers, simultaneous masturbation, and the misuse of Viagra in children (later clarified as a misunderstanding).  The hosts interjected with jokes and ribald remarks, including a "Fag Talk" skit.  Richard Voss was repeatedly discussed, along with Kenny, a show employee, who participated in the conversation.  *The Shining* was repeatedly referenced.

The show ended with a nonsensical conversation about sports teams, leading to a discussion of bizarre sexual acts, including a caller's story about sex with and consumption of deli ham. Opie discussed beating children at online chess, and another caller, Darren, shared his experiences using power sanders and weed whackers for self-pleasure.  The show concluded abruptly with the hosts expressing disbelief.

[00:04:30]  They didn't show him on TV. 
[00:05:00]  No, he got nothing.  He didn't even come close to placing.  Excuse me, we're broadcasting over here.  Look at him.  He looks like he's all scared.  Oh my God.  I thought that was a fake look.  It's like, I'm screwing up the whole thing.  But let's get to this part of the show.  But let's get to this part of the show.  But let's get to this part of the show.  You lose.  I can't wait to hear this one again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This was great.  Bad thing.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  I'm tired.  Why?  I don't know.  But you're on vacation. 
[00:05:30]  It's all fun now.  Actually, you're out filming, aren't you?  No, I'm not.  Filming?  Not until the 16th.  Oh.  Wow, this one stunk.  Perfect.  This is a horrendous intro.  Maybe the bit will be better.  Hit it.  People would have had horrendous intro.  Shut up.  I gave us a good out there so we can move on and get this shit recorded so we can get out of here and enjoy our day.  I'll give us a good out.  Here's the out.  Here's Opie and Anthony when they aren't stinking.  Who took their shoes off?  It's a little stinky in here.  The worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:06:00]  Asshole kid.  This is a great clip and I think it's from Boston.  It is Boston.  Oh, yeah.  This is typical Southie.  Father and son in Southie.  Who knows the background of this besides the obvious?  The kid decided to tape his father because I guess his father is a maniac.  Yeah, he's wound tight.  He's pissed off when he's late.  And I think he was purposely late and his father was just sitting there waiting for his son.  What a little shit, man.  So the kid just rolls tape and freaking just works his dad.  I'm not getting in the car. 
[00:06:30]  I'm not getting in the car.  Shut the fuck in the car.  Dad.  Dad.  I'm going to look at time.  Get your ass in.  Calm down.  Shut your fucking ass in.  It's 11.10.  What time did I fucking tell you?  11.  Get the fuck here.  Dude.  What the fuck time is this thing?  What the fuck time is this thing?  It says 11 fucking 10 in there.  It's 11.21.  It says 11 fucking 10 in the house.  You think I'm fucking sitting out here for 20 minutes for your fucking ass?  Why didn't you come in?  Fuck you. 
[00:07:00]  You tell me 11 o'clock, you fucking cunt.  Don't waste my fucking time again.  You don't even give a shit.  It's a fucking joke to you, right?  I didn't think you were here yet.  It's a fucking big joke to you.  Fucking happy hour.  I'm missing your fucking cunt.  That sounds like every time Bob Kelly is helping with my computer.  That miserable piece of shit.  This is for all the expecting parents out there. 
[00:07:30]  There you go.  Can't wait for their little bundle of joy.  When they're so cute running around when they're little.  This is what they grow into.  They tape you, driving you crazy.  That kid was, what, 11 minutes late?  Something like that.  Jesus, lighten up.  Pops.  You fucking cunt.  I'll fucking show you a joke.  You fucking asshole.  He's all talk.  You are so fucking unappreciative.  Unappreciative. 
[00:08:00]  Inconsiderate.  It didn't pop into his head.  He couldn't figure out.  Unappreciative isn't inconsistible.  I didn't see that coming after cunt.  No.  Father probably played baby Mozart for the kid.  I don't think this guy was playing baby Mozart.  That really is a weird group of flirty news.  You're a cunt.  And not only, but you're lackadaisical.  What is Ellen doing?  Oh, she's just awful.  It's a carpet and she's jumping face first. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, what was that about?  What a shock.  You are like a fucking cunt.  You're so fucking unappreciative.  You don't give one shit.  You're in there fucking laughing your ass off.  Where?  Where was I letting my ass off?  Can you please talk to me, Dad?  I don't want to fucking even see your fucking face.  Why?  Dad, please talk to me.  Because you're a cunt.  You're a fucking cunt. 
[00:09:00]  Wow.  This is parenting at its best.  He just wants to listen to his socks.  Is that what he's listening to?  Yeah, of course.  It sounds like a baseball game.  It has to be the socks.  I thought it was maybe Pat's.  Oh, maybe.  Yeah, good point.  What time is it?  It's seven fucking...  The next five minutes fast.  All right.  Fifteen fucking minutes.  I'm there five minutes early.  I'm there for 20 fucking minutes.  People kept coming to the window.  You knew I was out there.  No, I didn't.  You can't tell me what I know and not know. 
[00:09:30]  Why didn't you come in and be like a normal...  Why didn't you go outside at 11 o'clock?  I thought you were not afraid.  You told me 11 o'clock.  You told me 11 o'clock.  And then you feel that...  You told me 11 o'clock, fuckhead.  I did that last time.  You left the guest waiting outside.  I'm not saying it's your fault.  I'm just saying...  I'm telling you, you're a fucking cunt. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, that's great.  Oh, wow.  This is brutal.  And the son's just egging him on because he knows tape's rolling.  Yeah.  You're a fucking unappreciative fuckhead.  Since you've placed my income and I'm building a multi-million dollar business with no employees.  One of the best parts is that my income is not tied to...  You don't give a flying fuck.  Could you calm down?  Like, really?  15 minutes.  That's pretty insignificant. 
[00:10:30]  Why are you so manly insignificant?  It's not insignificant.  Yes, it is.  15 minutes.  What the fuck?  It's insignificant to you.  Sure to you.  Yeah, it is.  You can't.  I'm sitting out there for 15 minutes.  15 minutes.  15 minutes.  Yeah.  If it's fucking 15 minutes, then I shouldn't be fucking waiting.  You fuck.  Stop grabbing me.  Stupid fuck.  Dad, that was 15 minutes.  11 o'clock.  You don't give a shit.  You know I'm always up at 11 o'clock. 
[00:11:00]  No problem calling me.  Wake me up.  I'll go get you.  Well, I don't fucking mind.  But I do fucking mind when I get away 15 or 20 minutes.  You fucking cunt licker.  You dick licker.  He didn't realize he had screwed that up.  Wow.  You cunt licker.  Oh, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I do that.  That was completely the opposite direction he went there.  You're full of shit.  I mean, correct.  You were goddamn late on time. 
[00:11:30]  So he, it's at night.  It's 11 o'clock at night.  Maybe a school dance or something.  Yeah, he had to pick him up.  I mean, all the kids really got to say is, would you rather I drive home?  Imagine if I got killed on the way home, how you'd feel.  Is that worth 15 minutes?  My life?  Daddy?  He's egging the father on, though, because the father's done talking.  He keeps going, watch 15 minutes.  Watch 15 minutes.  Quit grabbing me.  Nothing to you.  That's right.  Nothing to me.  Can you talk to me?  Excuse me.  You don't even give a shit about my fucking time? 
[00:12:00]  Who gives a fuck?  What took you so fucking long?  Why did you...  You're telling me?  Okay.  You're telling me it was a movie.  Okay.  Whoa.  Okay.  You're telling me it was a 10 past 11 when you left that house, right?  I thought it was.  Because I wasn't paying attention at the time.  You don't even pay attention.  I made a shit. 
[00:12:30]  Okay.  So...  You don't even pay attention.  So the world revolves around you.  Is that what you got?  I don't even pay attention.  You told me 11 o'clock.  You told me 11 o'clock.  So, okay, I'll pick up 11.  I said, okay.  You told me!  No, I didn't!  You asked Foddy what time you fucking...  I asked Laura.  She told me.  You just said I told you!  I was kidding.  I'm taking a lift here, Mike?  Yeah, I guess so.  Oh, it's in the car, too.  Oh, wow.  Maybe the friend was the one recording it.  Maybe the friend was recording it.  Maybe.  Yeah, could be. 
[00:13:00]  Tell me which way to go.  Well, I wait.  No, never mind.  Go straight.  Go straight?  Yeah, you thought you were somewhere else.  I think you left off a cunt licker.  Shut the fuck up.  That's how they make up.  You're a fucking asshole.  You are a fucking asshole.  Dad, you need to calm down, buddy.  No, you need to fucking say,  Oh, Dad, I'm fucking sorry.  Oh, Dad, I'm fucking sorry.  Not like that.  Well, you said it just like that.  Not like that.  What do you want from me,  cunt sucker fuck luck? 
[00:13:30]  Shut the fuck up.  Don't give me shit.  Okay.  You're not in any position.  I have to take all your shit.  You better fucking believe it.  I'm not a believer.  I'm not trying to believe at all.  You're a fucking whining, crying,  little fucking bastard.  I'm whining and crying.  This fucking camera's like a fucking bitch.  The cunt licker, cunt sucker,  motherfucker is a whining bitch.  Is that supposed to take a left hand?  I'm going to fucking... 
[00:14:00]  So you're sitting in there.  The movie didn't get all the way.  I'm sorry.  I made a mistake.  You don't go looking for me.  I made a mistake.  Fuck you.  I made a mistake.  I don't believe it.  Good.  Then don't bitch about it.  She's not going to make shit better.  I don't fucking believe it.  You knew I was out there.  No, I didn't.  You got shit to go looking.  The girl fucking left.  Her parent come.  She comes running right the fuck out  as soon as they come.  What?  They're looking.  She's looking for the person.  She's looking for her fucking ride.  Take a left ear.  Yeah.  Thank God.  She's looking for her fucking ride. 
[00:14:30]  I love the way it's going back and forth.  You're a little fucking cunt.  There's a fork in the road.  Which way do I go?  This is great.  Looking for the person.  She's looking for her fucking ride.  Take a left ear.  Yeah.  Thank God.  She's looking for her fucking ride.  I made it before her fucking ride.  She came in and said, hey.  Did she have it?  Did her fucking parent have to come in and get her?  I'm not her.  I'm sorry. 
[00:15:00]  I made a mistake.  Fucking asshole.  I made a mistake, Dad.  Fucking dickhead.  Normal fucking dick.  Drive up, get out, go in.  I made a mistake.  Not with you.  Not with my kid.  No, I can't have that with my kid.  I'm sorry, Dad.  I made a mistake.  What do you want?  I fucking apologize and everything.  If I thought that, if I really thought that it wouldn't happen again, if you said, like  you're saying you're sorry, I made a mistake, but I know it ain't going to make a fucking  difference.  Right.  That's how I am. 
[00:15:30]  Why don't you fucking accept me?  Fuck up with your book.  Should I fucking kill him now?  There it is.  I'm sure it keeps going and going, but that is nice.  That was fun to listen to.  That's a great little relationship.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Pat from Unaki, hot dog eating contest.  What do we know about this, Anthony?  Well, we know Pat, Pat from Unaki, comes by and lets us know that he's going to be in  the Nathan's hot dog eating contest.  Remember that?  They do that every July 4th.  And he talks about the contest and what he did to win admission into the Nathan's thing. 
[00:16:00]  Like his preliminary bout, I guess.  He's just a fat fucker-like seed.  And an update on this bit.  They didn't show him on TV.  No, he got nothing.  He didn't even come close to placing.  Oh, excuse me.  We're broadcasting over here.  Look at him.  He looks like he's all scared.  Oh, my God.  I thought that was a fake look.  It's like, I'm screwing up the whole thing.  Let's get to this Pat thing.  You lose.  I can't wait to hear this one again. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  This was great.  Pat thing.  Here's Opie and Anthony when they don't suck.  Good for what ails you, what what?  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll, let it roll, let it roll.  Hey, that's pretty cool.  All right, let's get Pat from Menachie in here.  We're running out of show. 
[00:17:00]  Pat was, here he comes, running right in, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, hey.  One of our faves.  Oh, can I see the trophy?  That's the trophy, huh?  Yeah.  That's pretty big.  No, don't smash it, Opie.  Oh, wow.  Are you nuts?  I thought he was going to do it.  Boy, this has got to weigh at least a half a pound.  It is.  It's genuine gold paint.  It says, Anthony, Nathan's famous Philadelphia 2005 hot dog eating champ.  Wow.  That's me. 
[00:17:30]  Here you go.  Bravo, sir.  Did you drink some eggnog out of this thing?  No, I puked up hot dogs into it.  Did you really puke into it?  No.  Just kidding.  Nathan's famous to the hot dog eating champ.  Yes, and it's the old, oldie-style loving cup.  Yes.  The one Lucy got stuck on her head in the I Love Lucy episode.  Remember that?  Yeah.  So you're in the finals?  Yeah.  I beat three ranked guys, like the 11th in the world.  Some guy drove down from Buffalo. 
[00:18:00]  Buffalo Jim Reeves.  And you kicked his ass?  Yeah.  How many hot dogs did he eat?  20 and a half hot dogs.  20 and a half?  In 12 minutes.  In 12 minutes.  Yes.  And how many was the next place down?  He was close.  It was 19 and three quarters.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Right when that time goes, you've got to stop and drop whatever you have in your hand.  Do you have a technique?  Do you wet him down?  Some of the guys wet him.  Yeah, I learned that from the last one.  Last one, I got 15, and I improved my technique.  Certainly. 
[00:18:30]  Because I noticed everybody was dunking them.  So I started just eating the hot dogs and then dunking the buns.  But that got monotonous, so then I just dunked the whole hot dog.  Yeah.  So I plan on improving in Coney Island.  Now.  And there's pictures all over the website, foundrymusic.com and opiananthony.com, if  you want to see Pat in the contest.  Now, what is the record there for the one that they do at Coney?  Oh, that's the Japanese fellow, Kobayashi.  53 and a half hot dogs.  In how long?  He pretty much has been winning it for the last four years. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, this guy.  And he's not a big guy.  I know.  The closest American is Sonia Thomas.  She does 33 hot dogs.  33.  And how long?  12 minutes.  It's a 12-minute contest.  So it's a 12-minute contest.  And you did 20?  And a half.  And a half.  How many more could you do?  Were you holding back?  I don't know.  I didn't think I could do 20.  Well, I was hoping to do 20.  20 is respectable.  They call that doing the deuce.  Doing the deuce.  There's a whole lingo.  I like that.  I'm an official member of the IFOCE. 
[00:19:30]  I'm a competitor.  The International Federation of Competitive Eating.  Wow.  I'm an athlete.  You are an athlete.  They give you a card?  I feel a heart attack coming on.  They give you a card?  No, I didn't get that yet.  They're still processing my application.  So you're going to join any other eating contest?  I watch Deep Throat, the practice work.  Are you going to join any other eating contest?  Because they're eating everything now.  I'm on their mailing list. 
[00:20:00]  And they're going to email me what the different contests are.  So I pretty much eat, like, if I like the food, I'll eat it.  So if it's like meatballs or pizza, I'll eat it.  But I think the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest is probably the most famous eating contest in the world.  That's going to be live on ESPN.  I'm not sure if it's ESPN or ESPN2.  Live, high noon, July 4th.  Well, now...  And you made it to the finals?  That's amazing.  That was a qualifier. 
[00:20:30]  How many?  120.  20 people in the world.  They're having contests in England, Japan.  And our Pat from Anaki is in the finals.  And I may have a nice big XM painted on my head.  Oh.  Yeah.  Now, how many people...  I want an East Egg.  I want an East Egg.  Doing visual bits.  How many people are in this?  Luke, I'm your father.  He's put the visor around his neck.  A white visor.  Duck season.  Duck season.  Okay. 
[00:21:00]  That's more visual.  I'm a dog.  Now he puts the visor upside down around the front of his neck and tries to scratch like a dog with one of those veterinary collars.  Lampshade collars.  Sure.  Lampshade jules.  Remember Spock's brain?  Yeah.  Oh, very good.  Spock's brain.  Yes, doctor.  That's my logical talking.  They put that thing on the back of his head so he could still walk around and stuff.  Sure.  And remote control.  I don't know who's worse.  You're doing it and me knowing every single one you're doing. 
[00:21:30]  Visor impressions, Opie.  Hey, we're very impressed there, Pat.  Thank you.  Now, yeah, so how many people?  I'm sorry.  20.  20.  So there's only 20 people.  Yes.  Out of all the people that have tried out in the world, you are one of 20.  You are one of the elites, sir.  Yeah.  Now, how can we, of course, as the Opie and Anthony show, invade your great moment that you should just have a moment and be happy with?  How could we then tread on it? 
[00:22:00]  Well, I have to wear Nathan's official shirt.  Is that the one?  Yes, it is.  That's it right there.  Eat all that you can eat.  That's a great slogan.  That's my philosophy in life.  And, okay, so have they told you you can't wear anything?  No, they didn't say anything like that.  I've been wearing the ONA wow hat I got from Ziggy.  Thank you, Ziggy.  From XM411.  Right.  And, yeah, you know what? 
[00:22:30]  At the Philly contest, there was a CBS news camera.  And if someone were paranoid, I don't think it made the news.  Because they were filming it, and then they didn't even notice.  I gave Steve some video, and they didn't notice me until I had 15.  And my friend was yelling, Pat from Moon Hockey has 15.  ONA party rock.  She was screaming.  ONA party rock.  Yeah, and then all of a sudden they go, out of nowhere, Pat.  Oh.  So, yeah.  Like a derby winner.  Yeah.  Out of nowhere.  You didn't lead from the beginning? 
[00:23:00]  No, actually, I think they beat me at, they give you plates of five.  And I had, they were beating me at five hot dogs, and then at ten.  And then somewhere around 15, it was like neck and neck.  They had 17, and I got 17.  They started slowing down, and you were picking up a little steam.  It was a nail biter.  It sounds like it.  Yeah.  A hot dog biter.  And it's July 4th.  Yes.  Well, we'll be tuned into that one. 
[00:23:30]  That is awesome.  On July 4th.  I have some theories on why that Kobayashi wins.  What's your theory?  I was thinking maybe Hiroshima, a little radiation in Grandpa there.  Maybe he has a black hole in his stomach.  Hoo-hoo, lobbing.  Hoo-hoo, lobbing?  Black hole?  That's the Asian way, you would say, with the R, the L.  Maybe I should just let him eat maybe 54, 55 hot dogs, and then just eat him. 
[00:24:00]  I'll win by proxy.  Oh, there you go.  So how many more do you really think you could eat?  I don't know.  When they were announcing the names, everybody had a moniker.  Buffalo Jim, Humble Bob, and Brian Yellowcake Subich, or as I like to call them, losers.  I was like, I ain't gonna win this, but then I just kept going.  Yeah.  What's gonna be your, do you have a cool name that you can?  Uh...  Well, I was thinking either Pat from Munaki, and then I tried out a little character you'll 
[00:24:30]  see on the videotape.  I was gonna be Mysterioso.  He just put on one of those pairs of glasses that have the big, bushy eyebrows, the big nose and the mustache.  Maybe I should shorten the mustache to be...  Hilti. Hilti.  What's in these hot dogs?  All right, Jesus.  Uden!  All right, all right.  Never mind.  What's wrong?  I'll punch a mic here.  Welcome to the O.P. and Andrew. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, dinner.  Hey, man, here you go.  No, no, no.  That's cool.  Keep it.  Mmm, chicken.  XM202, the O.P. and Anthony show.  We're going to play the Pat O'Brien sex tapes.  Great stuff, man.  If you're new to the show and didn't get to hear this when we first ran it, you probably didn't hear it anywhere else either because nobody was airing this. 
[00:25:30]  We have the freedom here on XM to air the Pat O'Brien sex call tapes, unedited, and it's really some funny stuff.  This guy is just a sick bastard.  My new hero, too.  Perverted bastard.  I love him.  Pat O'Brien sex tapes.  Hey, do we have the Entertainment Tonight music, or could they play it in New York? 
[00:26:00]  Because you've got to do the Entertainment Tonight voice for the Pat O'Brien story.  Do we have the hack puker voice?  Do we have it?  It's beyond puker, isn't it?  What?  That voice that that woman does for one of the entertainment shows, it's just that she, it's not human.  We're waiting, we're waiting, we're waiting, we're waiting, we're waiting, we're waiting.  Pat O'Brien.  News today on Pat O'Brien.  Pat O'Brien faces his demons of alcohol and checks into a rehab facility. 
[00:26:30]  For years, Pat O'Brien has reported on problems facing Hollywood stars, formerly on Yaxias Kialiwad,  more recently on his new show, The Insya Wadier.  Now, the former Chicago sportscaster is facing his own demons.  I've had problems with Yaxias Kialiwad.  How many syllables can they cram in a word? 
[00:27:00]  This is a great thing Pat is doing, said longtime O'Brien friend and associate one day.  He's finally facing up to something many of us had known was a puker, puker, puker, puker, puker, puker, puker, puker, puker, puker, puker.  Puker, puker, puker, puker, puker, puker, puker, puker, puker, puker, puker, puker, puker, puker, puker, puker, puker, puker, puker.  He's facing up to it.  Pat O'Brien.  So he's an alcoholic.  He's an alky, but, Opie, that isn't the whole story.  Apparently he checked into this rehab facility because he knew. 
[00:27:30]  Are you saying we're going to go inside the story?  Inside the inside skill warrant.  Oh, that's not all.  That's not all.  But this story has an even darker skill wide.  It seems Pat's a fuker, yucking pervert.  This guy gets all tanked up and makes phone calls.  And, uh, oops, one of them gets taped. 
[00:28:00]  Now Pat O'Brien's married, right?  I guess so.  Pat O'Brien married and he was getting drunk, calling this woman and trying to work out a threesome with him, his wife, and this woman.  Is this 1998?  No, it's not 1998.  Oh, okay.  I just got a little confused.  Pat O'Brien.  It's now.  Oh, Pat O'Brien.  I'm sorry.  It's now.  Yes, I'm really sorry.  I seem to remember something very similar, but maybe I'm having just that deja vu weird thing that happens to you. 
[00:28:30]  I've never checked into rehab.  Jesus.  1998, huh?  I mean, 2005.  2005.  I'm a little confused.  2005.  Oh, yeah.  It says right on USA Today.  March 22nd, 2005.  2005, right.  Okay.  We'll read the court documents of Anthony, who settled the case right when this testimony made its scene in court.  Got a post and daily news reporter sitting in the courtroom. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, Anthony, is it true that you tried to invite other women into your...  Settle!  I'll settle!  Give her whatever she wants!  The reporters, you can leave now!  They're trying to live like a rock star.  Look what happens.  You're such a hero to a lot of people out there.  You know that, right?  A hero.  Were there whips involved?  No whips.  I don't need to know, Anthony. 
[00:29:30]  That's your private life.  It was a long time ago, Opie.  Many, many moons ago.  That's right.  I got the DD snort today.  Hey, look at this.  I'm better than Pat.  Pat couldn't close the deal.  All right.  He faces his demons of alcohol, checks into rehab, and once you check into rehab, everything's fine.  Yeah, that's the thing you do in Hollywood.  You could do the most outrageous crap, but you just blame it on the alcohol and the drugs.  You go to rehab, and everyone's like, ah! 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  Wow, that is weird when that door slams.  I know.  It sucks a lot of the thing out.  Anyway, so we have the audio of Pat O'Brien.  Yeah, that's what I hear.  I haven't heard this yet.  This is the beauty of...  Do you need to tape somebody or no?  I don't know.  Hey, you know something?  It would probably be illegal for us to tape somebody on the phone because of some FCC rules.  But for some reason, when these tapes get out, you play them anywhere.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Ah, what's the rule?  Ah, who cares?  This is the beauty of satellite radio.  No one else is going to give me the unedited version, right?  Unedited.  I hear some racy talk from Pat O'Brien. 
[00:30:30]  I like to call it saucy.  Saucy?  Wow.  It's saucy stuff.  I like racy, but saucy...  Racy is dirty.  Saucy is sexy.  Racy involves a black woman.  Yeah?  I don't know.  Saucy.  Let's try that.  Nothing?  Nothing?  Nothing.  This is risque.  Risque is good, too.  Boring.  Saucy.  I like saucy talk.  You take your wine, a little sugar, put in your meat.  You may have to talk 30 to 100 guys one day. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, no.  The showstopper's going to talk again.  Oh, here we go.  Oh, no.  I actually heard the audio this morning.  Uh-huh.  On the way down here, I didn't have a room, so I shared a room with...  You're going to describe the whole scene of going into the room, turning on the recorder?  I happened to share a room with Steve.  Yeah.  And this morning, I was laying in bed, and Steve was playing the audio on his laptop,  and certain things you just don't want to hear when you're alone in a room with Steve  when you're half asleep, and...  Oh, did you go...  Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep?  I absolutely did, because when you hear the beginning of this phone call, and some 
[00:31:30]  of the things he's saying, I thought it was Steve, and it was a little scary.  That's highly unlikely, but all right.  Where's your other hand?  Between two pillows.  Those aren't instant replay machines.  All right, Pat O'Brien.  All right, Steve, are we ready for the big exclusive?  We're the only show that can play the unedited version of this.  Now, what if we want to stop this?  Just cue me.  And talk.  We'll point to Steve.  Yeah.  In the old days, I would just stop the tape, Anthony, but, you know. 
[00:32:00]  Point at that cuddly face.  This means stop.  Okay, Jim.  Thank you.  I'll get you back, Steve.  I don't want to fuck you.  Go crazy.  All right.  What are you doing, Steve?  Oh.  Oh, you dicks.  You're just going to screw with them.  You didn't fall for that, did you?  You just both did the big stupid stops.  But there's obviously five feet behind you.  I don't want to stop like that.  Wow.  Yeah, rewind that, Steve.  God, that was too easy.  And get the Pat O'Brien clip, not the Joaquin Phoenix clip from the village. 
[00:32:30]  You guys suck.  All right.  All right, well, why don't we go to the tape?  So this is Pat O'Brien making a drunken phone call to a girl that he's trying to get in bed  with his either girlfriend or his wife.  I don't know if he's really married or whatever.  So let's hear.  I'll get you back, Steve.  I don't want to fucking go crazy with you.  So, um, I don't want to fucking go crazy with you.  To copy this message to another person, press 6. 
[00:33:00]  To delete this message and go to the next, press 7.  To keep the...  Saved message Sunday, 7.09 p.m.  You are so fucking hot.  And I want to be you.  I don't want you to suck my car.  I'm going to fuck you.  I don't want my girlfriend to eat you. 
[00:33:30]  You're so fucking hot.  You are fucking hot.  Let's do it.  You are so hot.  Please leave me a voicemail.  Go to the bathroom and leave me a voicemail.  Bye.  All right.  Hold on, Steve.  I just got to soak that in.  What an ass.  He left these on a machine.  Hey, uh, could someone get me the address for the insider?  There's a job opening over there.  Oh, my God.  There is no way he's coming back from that.  How can he come back? 
[00:34:00]  And can I say he's awful at talking dirty?  You're so fucking hot.  Fucking hot.  Migs was better at it.  He stinks.  I can smell your liquor breath.  What an ass.  He left that on a machine like this woman isn't, like, on a cell phone.  Did he say, suck my cock?  Oh, yeah.  He said he wanted to eat her and wanted her to suck his cock.  And then he said, go do the traffic.  Oh, my God. 
[00:34:30]  Is there more?  That's hard to come back from.  Yeah, there's another four minutes of this.  Oh, my God.  I'm hanging.  Let's go.  This guy's great.  Someone says it sounds like Florentine.  Yeah.  Special.  Save message Sunday, 7, 48 p.m.  I'm just so fucking into you.  But Betsy's so jealous.  But I fucking have sex, and I want to lick your pussy and suck your tits. 
[00:35:00]  But you have to be in the best.  I told Betsy that you were into her.  And if you get this message, just look at me and say yes.  But I want to fucking lick your pussy and make you cum so much.  And get crazy.  And why I'm like this.  But I don't want you badly.  I know you want me.  But you have to be in the best.  Betsy, too. 
[00:35:30]  I told you to get this message.  I should agree with you.  So, yeah.  Oh, wow.  First, the worst part is that if you're fucking a girl named Betsy.  You've got to be with old Betsy.  Dude, your mic is messing up.  I know it is.  That is unbelievable.  That guy is so completely in a froth.  That guy is in a fucking tizzy over this chick. 
[00:36:00]  He's probably, like, popping Viagra like they're Tic Tacs.  And now he just has a raging heart on them.  This guy cannot control himself.  He's thinking about this.  He can't even keep it in his head.  He's got to call this woman and tell her.  He's imagining licking her and doing it to him.  And he cannot even deal.  How did these tapes get out?  This woman, whoever he left the messages on, saved them all.  Obviously thought it was newsworthy.  Why?  What happened? 
[00:36:30]  Apparently she was flipping through the television one night at 730.  Hey, wait a minute.  I've talked to him before.  I know this guy.  I think I have some tapes.  Oh, my God.  How old are these tapes?  I don't know.  Any date on them?  Do we have any info on these tapes at all, Steve?  No.  I got sent a link, and that was it.  No background info.  Now, what's the reason that she released these tapes?  Do you know the back story?  We don't really know much about this, huh?  This showed up in the email.  It's just, Pat O'Brien talks dirty, drunk, and coked up.  That was the link I got.  And he said if you hear this message and you see me just nod and smile. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Is that Mike fading in and out, or no?  It's okay.  No, you're all right.  You've got to stay on, Mike, a little more.  Are we the only ones playing these tapes today?  I think so.  Maybe she personally sent it to us.  She's a fan of the show.  Wow.  I'm sure it's us and Betsy.  We're the ones who are...  Betsy.  You've got to be with Betsy, though.  I called Betsy.  Betsy's so jealous.  Betsy.  I want to lick your pussy.  You heard it here first, folks.  Pat O'Brien facing his demons.  He wants to leah-yuck her pure-yussi. 
[00:37:30]  You heard a horny Pat O'Brien right here exclusively on the Opium Yantam Yantam Yantam Yantam Yantam Yantam show.  Pat O'Brien, that horny fucker, he just wants to lick her pussy.  He can't even take it.  And then we also heard him say, he wants her to suck his kyoyak.  He wants to make her kium over and over again, as he licks her pyokyossi.  He wants to lick her tits. 
[00:38:00]  Pat O'Brien, horny old bastard.  Can he get Bietzy in on the whole situation?  We'll find out later in the pyokyossi.  On Inside Edition, he wants to stick his tongue inside her puss.  We got more, Steve?  Will Betsy say yes?  Yeah, well, let's see what happens.  Maybe it's a whole, maybe there's a conclusion to this. 
[00:38:30]  Here we go.  So copy.  Saved message, Sunday, 7, 51 p.m.  He doesn't even know if she's into this or not?  This idiot is just leaving these messages saying, if you agree with this, just wink at me? 
[00:39:00]  Wow.  Well, she must work with him or something, right?  What a risk.  Well, she's just going to walk down the hall and just give him a nod?  I have a pertinent question in this whole situation.  Yes, Anthony?  How are we sure this is Pat O'Brien?  It sounds like him.  It does sound like him.  Oh, no, I will not say it doesn't sound like him, but how are we sure enough to play this  as Pat O'Brien, not having any confirmation?  There's no news.  I thought this was attached to a news story that Pat O'Brien's sex tapes have leaked out. 
[00:39:30]  Are we going to be part of a story later today, Steve?  Jesus.  Steve, I thought this was part of a story that was out in the news that these tapes have surfaced.  That's why he's in rehab, blah, blah, blah.  Hey, we got a huge audience, and they're all over the country.  Hey, guys, is anyone else playing the Pat O'Brien thing today?  You know, if your morning show is playing them, phone in.  We'd like to hear it.  Yeah, because right now I think we're committing some kind of crime. 
[00:40:00]  It's actually Pat from Munaki.  In the last tape, you're going to hear Pat go, just wink.  Now, you know, hey, I like it as much as the next guy.  This is really funny stuff.  But are we now alleging that this is Pat O'Brien?  Imus is playing them as well.  Imus is playing it?  Yeah, but he can't play them like we're playing them.  Yeah, I've got to edit all the fun stuff out.  You just imagine.  A bunch of bleeps and bloops.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Here's Pat O'Brien talking about boop jobs.  It stinks. 
[00:40:30]  Wish I was on that.  Satellite.  Satellite.  I'm no dummy.  Don't talk to me like that.  I'm Imus.  Yeah, yeah, satellite.  You were right.  I'm a dick.  Boy, I like to eat your pussy.  You can't.  Suck in my cock.  I'll lick your tits.  Yeah, yeah, baby.  Yeah, so just wink at me when I'm walking by you. 
[00:41:00]  If I tip my cowboy hat at you, it means I want to fuck you.  Imus in the morning.  Jesus, dude.  That's a really good impression.  When I have my, um, look, I want to jiggle my turkey neck at you.  All right, look, I'm going to teabag you.  And, uh, my testes hang real low because I'm an old man.  And, uh, if you want that, just wink at me, baby.  Because I want to lick that pussy and suck those tits, baby. 
[00:41:30]  Baby!  I want to do a Billy Saul Hargis bit while, um, you suck my cock.  Moby Worm's coming to get you out of my pants.  Oh, shut up, jerk.  All right, how many more minutes of this, uh, illegal tape?  It might be Pat O'Brien tape.  No, it's, uh, the Daily News picked up on it, too.  And, uh, we're printing the article now.  Oh, okay.  I've got three minutes left.  Whew!  Yeah, we cover our asses as we're doing it. 
[00:42:00]  After the break.  Hey, it's me.  I am so fucking into you.  And you have to pay attention to Betsy, but let's have fun.  I want to fucking eat you and fuck you and suck your tits and...  watch you eat Betsy and lick your ass.  I'm so fucking into you.  It's incredible.  Wow.  That's the ass lick.  Check this message and then just say to me, 
[00:42:30]  yes, the kids can watch us.  Let's just fucking have fun.  I'm so fucking, you're so fucking hot.  And I don't do this for a living.  It's just, like, new to me.  But I want to fucking make you crazy.  Bye.  You are with those phone calls, you nuts.  You're a kook.  You're driving me crazy, okay?  And just the signals he wants, if you're into this,  just breathe while you're in the office. 
[00:43:00]  Just when the phone rings, pick it up and say hello.  Yeah, yes.  You know why he's using the blinking and the breathing and all that?  Because he's actually talking to Mary Shivo.  I wonder, today's not talking to his sister, Terry, who's actually in the news lately.  Oh, oh, oh.  Wow.  Still funny, though.  That's hilarious.  Sam.  Most people were laughing.  That was very funny.  They made the connection until you had a...  I had to.  Crushed my little phone. 
[00:43:30]  Mary Shivo.  Is her sister named Mary, at least?  I don't know.  I have no idea.  But listen, back to the Frank O'Brien tapes.  Here it is.  Here's the story from the Daily News.  Hosts rehab hold the phone.  What's the inside story on insider host Pat O'Brien's decision to enter rehab Sunday?  Hollywood sources suggest the timing was to defuse the release of several sexually explicit voicemail messages  available on the Internet yesterday soliciting sex from an unidentified woman. 
[00:44:00]  And then in quotes, let's just bleeping have sex and fun and drugs and go crazy.  Oh, we didn't get to that part now.  Says the male voice.  Yesterday's reps for the insider would not comment on widespread attribution of the voice to O'Brien.  The tape describes in graphic detail just how badly the caller wants various activities that involve, gosh, all parts of a woman's body.  I'm so into you.  Betsy is so effing jealous, the voice claims in one message. 
[00:44:30]  You know you want me, but you have to be with Betsy, too.  The insider host has one child with his wife, Linda.  Who's Betsy?  I don't know.  Sadly, by the final message, Betsy seems to have pulled out of the threesome.  Oh, they ruined it.  They spoiled it.  You don't have to say that part.  Yeah, but I was reading it.  Who's Linda?  Who's Linda?  Well, then I won't read the last quote. 
[00:45:00]  Ooh.  A little spoiler.  Ooh, Anthony.  Wow, that's something.  All right, why don't we go back to the tape?  Let's continue with the Pat O'Brien messages.  Check out.  Saved message, Sunday, 9.04 p.m.  Hey, it's me.  Um, you're so fucking hot.  We know.  Wait, wait.  All right, Pat.  Can I point out one thing? 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  The first message was 7.09.  The next one was 7.54.  This one is 9.04.  He has been jerking off for two hours calling his wife.  Not only that, he's got to be doing a lot of coke, because a lot of these messages are  one after another.  Oh, yeah.  It's just, come on.  Come on.  It's just coke's and heart-ons.  You are so fucking hot.  He's grinding his teeth.  His cock is three, maybe three quarters of an inch, and he can't get hard, and he's trying  to grab it and make it hard.  Come on.  Yeah, you're so fucking hot.  Come on, cock. 
[00:46:00]  Work.  Work.  Don't think of Betsy.  He's on a coke binge.  Anthony on Long Island, we're not going to go to the phones because they're really  screwed up today, but he writes, O&A are like Dan Rather with their source checking.  Yeah, look at us.  That seems to be Pat O'Brien.  It sounds like him.  What the hell?  Why not run it?  It's news.  Let's go back to the tape.  That's just like all of a sudden, I'm not into it, but the truth is to get together.  I want to fucking suck your pussy. 
[00:46:30]  Fuck good, it's you.  Watch you and Betsy eat each other.  Suck my cock.  Yeah.  It's going down to the checklist.  Jerk off in your face.  Do what?  Jerk off in your face.  Get another woman up.  Hire a hundred.  Let's get crazy.  Is there anybody who doesn't want to fuck? 
[00:47:00]  I want to put my cock in all the 150,000 dead tsunami victims.  I want to eat your pussy.  Have a look at her.  Jesus Christ.  Holy shit.  I want to fuck Salvi.  Fuck Vicky.  Fuck me while you're at it.  I want to fuck Tattalia.  Spazzini.  Stracci.  Salvi fuck Bessie.  I think Pat O'Brien's cock was bigger than yours. 
[00:47:30]  Today, I settle all of my cock's business.  He was banging such a way to do it at a time.  He was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had, and I've had him all over the world.  Oh, Betsy Lynn, the Pat, the Methodist.  Wow.  That guy, he's lost his mind.  Oh, my God. 
[00:48:00]  He's all coked up, drunk off his ass, and just horny.  Imagine how much clear stuff is on his hand.  Dude, it's like this.  He's grabbing it with the lower part, like his pinky, and that part, the second two fingers,  he's just grabbing the helmet and flipping off the helmet because he can't get a rock  because he's doing blow for six hours.  He's the greatest.  Wow.  Let's go back to the tape.  There's still more.  He is the greatest. 
[00:48:30]  If you agree with this, just look at me and say yes.  You know, you're so fucking hot.  I don't know what's wrong with me.  I don't do this.  But I fucking want to just fucking make you crazy.  I want you guys to make out. 
[00:49:00]  Come on, let's go get this message.  If you agree with me.  Let's just fucking have sex and fun, drugs.  Fuck.  Eat.  Go crazy.  Let's just kill people.  Let's just murder people.  Let's drive drunk. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, let's put on trench coats and walk into a high school.  Jesus Christ.  And fuck the dead bodies.  Oh, God.  What I like to chop your head off is just go fuck you.  Oh, I just want to put white powder in an envelope and dump it in your face and fuck you all.  Betsy Eats a hooker's ass.  If you agree with this, when I see you walk by me in the hallway, don't punch me in the face.  That'll bring the steak.  He's the worst.  Clark from Wagbag.com.  He writes on the instant feedback.  She's going to call back after he blows his wad. 
[00:50:00]  What a douche.  I want to fuck your ankle.  I want to suck your fifth vertebrae.  That's great.  I want to put Valium up your ass and have Betsy suck him out and then blow me and stick him in the tip of my dick.  If you agree with this, when I ask you what time is it, look at your watch.  He really is awful.  He's a redundant ass.  God almighty.  You know, this is a little obscure, but I'm going to go with it anyway.  Sandra Bernhardt in King of Comedy.  Oh, I know.  When Lankford was tied up and she's like, let's just get crazy. 
[00:50:30]  Let's get crazy.  Yeah.  You drive me crazy.  Jerry.  Yeah, that's what it's like.  Let's just get crazy.  Let's get nuts.  Let's get insane.  It has that same.  It's a turkey jerk.  I want to herky jerk with you and muck my hair up.  Do you want to kiss Betsy on the mouth?  God, why didn't we play this at seven instead of bitch about the equipment?  Oh, this is fantastic.  This is three hours of radio, not ten minutes.  I heard he got all pissed off and called her back after these tapes got out.  And a man in my position can afford to be made to look ridiculous. 
[00:51:00]  God damn.  That is great.  Oh, how embarrassing.  How completely embarrassing.  Oh, my God.  How do you get around this?  Even rehab.  You know, we were saying, you check into rehab, it smooths everything over.  But this is a toughie.  This is just a horny, drugged-out ass.  This isn't one phone call.  This is 50 with the same things over and over again.  Stalking.  And he's like, Betsy isn't really into it. 
[00:51:30]  And then he goes on, like a second later, he's like, you and Betsy would eat each other.  I want to know, what did she do that gave him a signal that this is what she wanted?  She probably flirted with him once and said, oh, my God, Betsy, oh, my God, what I would do with you two.  And then giggled and walked away.  That's a good point.  What did she say that warranted this guy calling her like a stalker with filth like this?  He misinterpreted something and just ruined his career.  But with the signals he's telling her to give back, it was probably, you know, I saw you go to the copy machine.  I saw that.  I know what that means. 
[00:52:00]  I want to get Betsy and then just pick up Jay Mansfield's head and eat it.  Jesus Christ, dude.  Get a hold of yourself.  Go out to the desert and beat you with a shovel and bury you.  We'll have a hooker come over and she'll want us to eat her pussy, but we won't want to.  So she'll give back 50 and then leave the room.  Horrible.  Should we go back to the tape?  Oh, you betcha.  You know how it's going to start.  Let's hear the next message.  Oh, you're so fucking hot.  I want to fuck you.  There's only 14 seconds left.  Lick you. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, we're down to the last 14?  Yeah, I think we're almost done with it, but here's the last bit.  That's it, huh?  That's it, huh?  Did he say kids can watch?  What?  Eden said.  Bring the kids in on it, too.  I don't care.  I want Adam Walsh's head in my lap while you suck my cock. 
[00:53:00]  Wow.  That's gold.  Oh.  I just fucking have sex and tobacco and drugs.  Fuck me.  I'm a meaner.  I'm a crazy guy.  I just go to save you.  You're so fucking hot.  I fucking want to fucking make you crazy.  I just go to say how much I care.  I'm so fucking in here.  It's incredible.  I just go to save you. 
[00:53:30]  I'm going to fucking suck your tits.  Once you eat that tea.  And lick your ass.  And I mean it from the bottom of my heart.  God, you're so fucking hot.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Anthony, one of my favorite things we do on this program is talk about our movie-going experiences.  Why the gap between movie and going?  Because I'm really tired.  I just want to go home. 
[00:54:00]  I like talking about that too.  Movie-going experiences.  Yeah.  I can't stand going to the movies.  I hate it.  Know what it was?  I looked down.  Okay, we're going to talk about movie-going experiences.  They hit record.  And then I looked up to have this conversation that we like to do.  Yeah.  And I forgot what it said on the paper.  So I went, movie!  And I had to look down.  Oh!  Going experiences.  And I looked up.  William Shatner's delivery.  Movie-going experiences.  Well, we all go to the movies and silly things happen. 
[00:54:30]  He's up on the gay shit.  Oh, Jim.  I don't understand why people go to the movies and just yap through the movie.  Or do anything.  Like, I always say stuff like, oh, I wish, you know, I wish everyone drove like me.  Because then everyone would get somewhere fast.  But, you know, I've got to be realistic.  Highways would be full of just blood and brain matter and stuff.  But the movie-going experience, I wish everybody handled the movies like me. 
[00:55:00]  I go in with the only reason I have to go to the movies is to see the goddamn movie.  I don't talk.  I sit there.  I watch the movie.  I don't answer cell phones.  I don't do anything.  What is the problem with people that they don't, that they have to be doing other things and ruining the movie-going experience?  Because there's so many people out there that they go with someone else to the movie that they feel like they have to acknowledge their presence in the theater. 
[00:55:30]  I don't go alone.  Huh?  I don't go alone.  I know.  But you're like a normal person.  But there's a lot of people out there just because they are going to the movie with their friend or boyfriend, girlfriend, what have you.  Yeah.  They have to acknowledge them throughout the whole movie.  Like, oh, my God.  You see?  Oh, wow.  You see that?  So I was saying, well, at the office the other day, there was...  Right, right, right.  What?  You're at the movie.  Shut up.  Shut up now.  They've got to yap.  Go talk about the movie at Starbucks after the film's over. 
[00:56:00]  There you go.  The answer to your question, why do people yap at the movies?  They actually need to do a study.  The answer, melanin.  There certainly is a disproportionate number of black people that like to talk at the movie as opposed to...  I wouldn't know because I go to the white movie theater.  Well, I do now too, Opie.  But as you know, I used to live in Brooklyn.  You search out the white movie theaters.  I had to go to the black movies.  And it is a little frightening. 
[00:56:30]  And unfortunately, it's not like you can turn around and say, hey, shh, please, I'm trying to watch the movie.  Because you'll probably get shanked in the throat.  Or punched and then wake up in a hospital with Christmas music playing.  The latest Christmas movies will be out.  Right.  That you can catch.  Excuse me, sir.  I'm trying to watch the movie.  BAM!  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  What happened?  I was...  Okay, I remember I was watching Star Wars. 
[00:57:00]  I heard a cell phone go off.  It was late May.  It was like, yeah, late May.  Why is there a Christmas tree in my room?  And now...  And this isn't my room!  It's 4.30 in the afternoon.  It's dark out.  I see Christmas lights  and there's presents around me.  Excuse me, sir.  We're trying to...  Bam!  Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock. 
[00:57:30]  Jingle...  What happened?  You used to go to the Comac movie theater, right?  Yep.  Until there were so many shootings that we got the hint  and Whitey realized, okay, this movie theater isn't for us.  More action in the lobby than on the screen.  They had so many people shooting at the screen,  shooting each other online.  Stabbings, too.  Stabbings.  It was a place where the gangs would just hang out  as you as a law-abiding citizen wanted to see a lousy movie.  Latin Kings from Brentwood would come in.  Very scary.  To get you through the weekend.  All you want to do is watch a dumb movie. 
[00:58:00]  And you couldn't even enjoy that  because you were worried that you were going to get shot or something.  That's all.  Just trying to see a movie.  And you've got to worry about getting in a fight.  And it doesn't matter.  I have the worst goddamn luck in movie theaters.  I will get there a little early.  I'll search out a good spot.  Okay?  Because I don't want to have to deal with climbing over people.  I don't want to sit in a seat that's too far away or too close  because then it's always on my mind.  I'm like, God damn it, I'm too far or I'm too close. 
[00:58:30]  So I get there a little early.  I pick out a good seat.  And it never fails that right before the movie starts,  a gaggle of criminals comes in and sits right around me.  Right around me.  And then I'm tense the whole movie going,  oh, I'm going to be killed because they're not going to shut up  and I'm going to get pissed and I'm going to throw something  and there's going to be a fight.  It never fails.  I'll sit there and go, I think we made it.  I think we made it.  The movie's starting, the lights are dimming,  and there's no one around us that could possibly, 
[00:59:00]  yeah, I think this seat here good.  It's the last.  Oh, no.  It's always the last minute traffic.  It is.  Because I'm the same way.  Ah, no one in front of me.  This is awesome.  The previews are just about over.  And here comes the movie and all of a sudden,  last second, they always sit right in front.  Here they come, right in front,  and they're punching each other and laughing  and trying to smoke and drink or do something in there.  Answer their cell phones.  Yeah, all their cell phones are going off like crazy.  You know how you do that thing, 
[00:59:30]  a kid running by screaming?  Yeah.  You ever been to a movie theater where, like,  they decide that the movie is good enough  for a babysitter, I guess?  Yeah.  They bring their kids to the movie theater  and their kids will run up and down the aisle?  Yeah.  Have you been in one of these?  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Up and down the aisle,  and you're looking at why aren't they containing this animal? 
[01:00:00]  Why?  Because it is.  It's a babysitter now.  They're on the cell phone in the corner somewhere  conducting business that they can't conduct  when their kid is around the house yelling.  And their kid now can just run around in the movie theater.  Yeah.  Because who cares?  It's their babysitter.  It just cost them a couple of bucks to get in there.  And I'm just trying to watch the goddamn movie.  Let's go to John and Comac.  John, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Comac.  Home of the Comac Motor Inn and the Comac Movie Theater. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, good times back in high school, man.  Good times.  Good times.  Yeah.  My first date ever.  I took these couple of girls, me and my buddy,  took these girls to the movie theater,  and we had a gun pulled on us.  Oh.  Why would you have a gun pulled on you?  Were you being robbed?  Did you speak up?  What happened?  No, we were a bunch of Comac kids.  You know, we were wearing little pieces of gold,  walking in there like we owned the place,  and a couple of kids in Brentwood do it otherwise.  Brentwood.  That is a dangerous area these days. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, good thing my friend's mommy was outside,  so we pulled ass to her car.  My friend's mommy.  The station wagon pulled up and let you kids off?  Yeah.  And you guys think you're badasses.  Yeah.  All badasses from Comac.  With your...  With your fine gold.  Go, go, go.  With your very thin bling on,  thinking you're all that.  And then the Brentwood Hispanics come in,  and it's over, Johnny.  My friend with his bar mitzvah gold on,  thinking he's a shit.  His bar mitzvah gold. 
[01:01:30]  All the people are wearing license plates.  I went one time to...  I figure a movie was with my buddies from work.  They were all these hardcore black guys.  We worked in a warehouse together,  and I didn't realize that there was a one-seat rule  when you sit next to another guy,  and it was an empty theater.  So we all walk in and sit down,  and I sit right next to my friend Malcolm.  He goes, what the fuck are you doing, man?  We're not dating.  Move over.  I'm sorry.  Leave an empty seat for a man.  A suburban idiot.  Sit next to another man.  No surprise here.  Let's go to James in Comac.  James. 
[01:02:00]  What's up, boys?  What's up?  Hey, man.  Two quick stories for you.  First one was,  and I never go to the Comac movie theater anymore  because it is just run by criminals,  but I ran into a pimp walking out one time.  A pimp?  Not a guy who looked like a pimp or, you know,  the full getup.  The loud green suit,  purple hat with an orange feather,  and a gold cane.  Huggy bear.  Yeah.  And had the whores from Brentwood nearby.  Second story was,  wait, he was trying to get the girls some dates  as people were leaving the movie theater? 
[01:02:30]  There you go.  That's a little business.  Oh, yeah.  What you guys got to understand now,  you know,  there are towns that just have these theaters,  like these black,  whatever you want to call them,  these gang theaters or what have you.  Gang theaters.  That's good.  But this Comac multiplex is in a relatively nice area.  Nice area,  but it borders with crap.  Yeah,  and people come from all over  because it was the first real multiplex in our area on Long Island,  and this is the stuff you just didn't expect at first.  No.  Going there.  But slowly but surely, 
[01:03:00]  all this moved in.  The pimps,  the drug dealing,  the gangsters.  You know when you look in the parking lot  and just see like a ton of old Toyotas  with spoilers on them  that you're in trouble  and gold-painted hubcaps.  You know there's trouble.  Second story for the guys.  I told this a couple years ago on N.E.W.  Was gone in 60 seconds.  A Latin family comes in right as the movie's starting  with their of my friends,  and they're stealing the cars and whatnot, 
[01:03:30]  and the Latin boyfriend,  baby daddy,  whatever you want to call him,  is going,  yo, man,  I haven't tried that.  I gotta fucking try that one.  He's picking up pointers.  Yeah, meanwhile,  the grandmother,  who looks like she's 25,  has the three-year-old kid  rocking back and forth,  hitting it to my legs  as I'm trying to watch the movie,  and baby daddy's telling me  about his methods of stealing cars.  It's a very safe movie theater.  That's classic.  All right, thanks, James.  Yeah, that one time 
[01:04:00]  I was at the movie theater in Brooklyn,  and I had a Hispanic family in front of me,  and they just went on and on  and wouldn't shut up,  and it was an entire row in front of us  that was just full of Hispanics,  and I'm sitting there going,  oh, jeez,  they're not going to shut up,  they're not going to shut up,  and my girlfriend at one point  just yells out,  would you shut the fuck up?  Oh, great.  And that's when the guy turned around  and said of his chick that was up there,  said, oh, she's in battle mode. 
[01:04:30]  Now she's in battle mode.  I'm like, battle mode?  Oh, this is trouble.  This is trouble.  You bring up something that's great  that maybe we can get into later.  You know, our chicks,  and I'm saying our chicks,  I'm talking about all guys out there  to get us in trouble.  You know, that's obviously something  your chick should have said,  right, Anthony?  Right.  But they're not turning around  and going to confront the chick.  No.  They're going to confront you.  No, it's me.  Now you have to defend your honor,  her honor. 
[01:05:00]  Because then the woman turns around  and goes,  how about I smack your face?  I'm like,  I just came to see  Mission Impossible 2.  I'm trying to see  Mission Impossible 2.  And now I'm in a fight for my life  with some Hispanic family.  Now it's just going to be  a mission to get out of this  mission impossible.  Get out alive.  Exactly.  She's throwing young  Hispanic children at me.  It's just horrific. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  Quick,  go for the exit  by the screen.  I think our car's parked outside.  Baby,  you go for the door.  I'm going to head  for the ventilation system.  I think I can get them  on my trail  and lose them.  Oh, she's in battle mode,  is she?  Unbelievable.  It was frightening.  Did you have to change seats?  What I did  was probably one of the,  you know,  the biggest whitey pussy moves ever. 
[01:06:00]  I got up  and left the theater.  Just left.  What was I going to do?  Dude,  there were,  it was a complete row.  One Hispanic family.  Guys,  those chicks  that'll pull razor blades out  and slit your throat.  And screaming children.  It was a whole family  that did not give a shit  what was going on  in this theater.  It was their living room.  It was their roach-infested  living room at the time.  Anyone in there  was an inconvenience  to them.  So I went up, 
[01:06:30]  you know,  I find the,  I find the assistant  to the assistant manager  at a movie theater.  Hey, Red,  you're the assistant  to the assistant manager.  And I was placed  in another theater  that was playing  Mission Impossible 2.  That's pretty cool.  That was just starting.  So I got to sit down  with other frightened  white people  that had left that theater,  I think,  because it was just,  there was only a few of us  and we were all white  just sitting there  kind of, 
[01:07:00]  I'm a pussy  but at least I'm seeing  the movie and I'm alive.  You know,  this is not a movie  that comes out  that I want to see  that badly  that I'll go on weekends  or when the movie theater  is crowded.  Yeah.  All these movies,  I wait to almost the day  it's going to be out  of theaters  and then I finally  see the movie  and then it's a lot less  people and a lot less hassle.  Every once in a while  I do get in a situation  because maybe other people  want to go  or what have you  and I'm in a crowded  movie theater  I have the strangest  pet peeve.  Maybe there's other people  out there that feel 
[01:07:30]  the same way  but when the previews  are done  and it gets really quiet  for that minute or two  as the movie's slowly  but surely starting up  I start hearing everyone  eating their popcorn  and opening up  their candy  and drinking their soda  it goes right through me  where I start like  getting all  I get nuts.  I get nuts.  It's kind of like  the same thing  that happens  when I hear  vacuum cleaners.  It goes right through me.  I don't know what it is.  When you're in a theater  and there's a couple  hundred people  all eating popcorn 
[01:08:00]  at the same time  it sounds like locusts.  It is the most disturbing sound.  Our locusts.  Next time  listen closely  as it gets dark  and really quiet  in the theater  and listen  what's going on  around you.  It is amazing.  Everyone  Yeah.  And the packaging  for all this stuff  is just the worst  because it's not  a quick little  rip and you're ready  to eat.  It takes forever  for these people  to open up their shit.  They're all digging in  their hands  and making noise. 
[01:08:30]  I don't even want  to admit this  on the air  but it just  it drives me  it's gotten to the point  where I'm with people  and they have to tell me  just relax, relax  it'll be over soon.  Yeah.  And there's been  a few times  where I want to just  walk out  I can't handle it.  And then  I'm just waiting  for everyone  to finish up  with their popcorn  and stuff  and it usually  takes a good  20 to 30 minutes  and then I can  finally relax.  Do you eat anything?  If I do  I'm so considered  because I know  how bad it is.  You wait until  the movie gets loud?  Or either  yeah or I'll  open up my stuff  beforehand  and no joke  I'm eating popcorn 
[01:09:00]  like  Just letting it  melt in your mouth  Basically  Yeah  Sopping it up  Squeeze it  between your tongue  and palate  It is one of my  worst pet peeves  That's a little rough  It's like if you  were taking your nails  and just right  across a chalkboard  It's the same  effect to me  Wow  It just drives me nuts  And people that  go with me  they think  they think  I'm out of my mind  I'm a Twizzlers guy  See that's nice  and soft  I don't think  that makes much noise  No  Popcorn makes  a lot of noise  Oh it's just like 
[01:09:30]  like I said  I'll say it again  like locusts  just going at it  Donnie on Long Island  What's up Donnie?  A couple of things  One is  here's worse  than guys talking  is guys  are the gangsters  talking around you  and I'm there  with my wife  and my wife  turns around  and goes  You guys haven't  shut up  in the entire  fucking movie  and so my wife  opens the can of worms  and now I'm the one  holding the bag  that has to like  defend her  and everything  and I look over  and I go  why don't you just  shut up  let them  you know  let them talk  Let them do  whatever they want 
[01:10:00]  Yeah because  she turns around  and she starts it  and then I gotta  get involved  you know  What did they do  besides apologize  to her for being loud?  You little bitch  and the girl  starts licking  my wife in the head  and then  the other thing  is you ever just  wish you were like  Charles Bronson  at that moment  and just deal with it  that way  you know  it's like imagine  Charles Bronson  next to the theater  okay you guys  shut the fuck up now  pull out a magnum  and blow their heads off  Yeah that would be nice  that would be fun  but then you would 
[01:10:30]  go to jail  for a long time  Yeah you'd go to jail  and the lawyer fees  would be  astronomical  You're a man in jail  what can you say  Alright thank you  Bye  Let's go to Mark  in Long Island  Mark what's up?  Hey guys  I went  about 10 years ago  me and my girlfriend  at the time  went to go see  A Time to Kill  so we're trying to go  she lived on the south shore  so we're trying to go  to Rockville Center  sold out  trying to go to  Westbury  anywhere we could go  it's all sold out  the only place  we can go to the movies 
[01:11:00]  is the Green Acres Mall  at Valley Stream  to see this movie  now you guys know  Green Valley Stream  so you get in there  and it's just like  a crime scene  waiting to happen  and it's all  you have to go through  metal detectors  to go through there  now the movie  A Time to Kill  there's somebody that's  some white guys  rape a little black girl  and whatever  everybody in the movie theater  thought they were  in a courthouse  and they were ready  to lynch  all the white people  and me and my girlfriend  are sitting there  just like oh my god  we are going to die  it is rough  to go to a movie 
[01:11:30]  that's racially charged  and look around  and see it's a very  diverse audience  people do tend to feel  a little uncomfortable  don't they  sit there  and oh this is  uncomfortable  I think it was a bad move  I went to see  Malcolm X in the theater  and there was one scene  where the cops  are beating up  a black guy  before X  and the rest of the  Muslims go down  to protest  and I actually went  good job officer  that could be  some trouble  for you there  Jimmy  let's go to Paul  on Long Island 
[01:12:00]  yeah hi  my wife and I  just moved to  Ronkonkoma  and we were looking  to go see  that movie Saw  and we went to  the Comac movie theater  which was a bad idea  but all the gang  kids  they just keep using  their bleep bleep  Nextel cell phones  the whole time  that's why  they got to bring  the drinking age  back down to 18  I'm telling you right now  because these kids  have nothing to do  but hang out  in movie theaters  go to the movies  yeah I mean  the parents are on  to the keg parties 
[01:12:30]  at their houses  when they're away  on those little  weekend jaunts  so what happens  it was happening  in Huntington  you know  every Friday  and Saturday night  the theaters  it didn't matter  what movie  were just packed  with teenagers  because that's  where they socialize  and hang out  and maybe cop a feel  during the movie  and they check  their cell phones  and they're text messaging  and they're running  they're getting up  10, 12 times  a movie  to run out in the hall  to run into  another theater  because they heard  this dude is there  or this chick is there 
[01:13:00]  yeah  it's just a whole  social thing  that has nothing  to do with  watching the movie  with actually  watching the movie  get the drinking age  down to 18  so these kids  have something to do  there you go  because then that means  you know  you'll be drinking  at 15 again  yeah  like the good old days  like the good old days  let's say hi to  Brian in Virginia  Brian what's up  hey I cannot  stay  the last movie  I went to  because of this  kind of crap  was Spider-Man  and we had  the most cliche  family  everything  the little kid  the cell phones  I got so  effing tired of it  I literally  pulled out a 
[01:13:30]  20 dollar bill  walked up to him  and said  if you just  fucking leave  you can have  this 20  they all stopped  looked at each other  and like they won  the lottery  okay great  that was the best  20 dollars  I ever spent  never thought of that  yeah right on  the Brooklyn theaters  I went to  they'd probably rob me though  if he has 20  yeah  if he has 20  to give me  he's probably got  a lot more on him  yeah or do they  just take it  and go  I ain't going nowhere  thanks  buy popcorn  yep  or some jujubes  or whatever else  young gentleman like  ammunition  same message  Sunday 
[01:14:00]  9  0 4  PM  you're so fucking hot  I have a big cock  I want you to suck it  I told Betsy  Betsy's so jealous  if you agree with this  when I see you  walk by me in the hallway  don't punch me in the face  I want to get Betsy  and then just pick up  Jane Mansfield's head  and eat it  if you're into this  just breathe  while you're in the office  oh I just want to put  white powder in an envelope  and dump it in your face  and fuck you all  Betsy  needs a hooker's ass  if you want to suck my cock  just look at me stupidly  and kind of half smile  you have no more messages 
[01:14:30]  hey this is Chris Jericho  and you're listening  to my little pal  little Jimmy Norton  isn't he sweet  isn't he cute  don't you just want to  kiss him  XM 202  the Opie and Anthony show  are we rolling  we are rolling  yes it's  it's Opie  it's Anthony  look at this  it's almost like  the old days Opie  it's just the Opie  and Anthony show  kind of like this  that's it  it's just us  here  there's no guests  no Jimmy 
[01:15:00]  nothing  no producers  nothing  I have to get  your coffee  you know  I like this a lot  you  you want to jerk off  no thank you  no  hey  let's see who's got  the biggest dick  no one else is here  to see  yeah  it'll just be you  and me  remember that time  in LA  we  what Opie  don't talk  about that  I know  well I'm not  going to finish  the story  school  let them 
[01:15:30]  try to figure  it out  in the meantime  the fine mayor  of New York  City decided  that he needed  to hit the  Spanish audience  so he made  a Spanish  commercial  yeah Spanish  language  trying to  get his  voter  his voting  audience  up  yeah so a light bulb  went on in our heads  and we decided  you know we could reach  more listeners as well  if we started doing  bits in Spanish  why not  so that's what we did  here's Opie and Anthony  when they're not awful  okay terrific 
[01:16:00]  the worst  of Opie and Anthony  no more of that  it's bad for you  anyway let's get the  Bill's dead thing  out of the way again  yeah  now uh  to explain  we were talking about  the mayor of New York City  yesterday  he's making commercials  for  for Hispanics  well he wants to win  another term as mayor  he's got a  has shitload of money  I mean the guy's a  billionaire  so he can spend it  and he can spend it  like other candidates  can't  he could go for the  niche advertising  of himself  you know it costs a lot 
[01:16:30]  to make a commercial  and to make one in  Spanish that just  you know  exclusively for  Spanish people  uh that might not be  good for somebody  on a limited budget  you want to cover  as much ground as you  can but Bloomberg  can just  doesn't matter  he can speak Yiddish  to get to the Hasidics  you know he's one of  those guys  who can spend all that  money  and that's what he did  and he did one  completely in Spanish  and it sounded like  he didn't really know  how to speak the language  of course he didn't  he just read it  phonetically  he read it phonetically  so Anthony and I  came up with a  cute little idea 
[01:17:00]  quick idea  that maybe we should  translate some of our  better bits into Spanish  for the  maybe we'll get some  Spanish listeners that way  for the Spanish speaking audience  imagine they're just  tuning around  the uh  the dial XM  and uh  they hear all of a sudden  some Spanish coming out  and go  oh what's this  I think XM is launching  a Spanish station  or a couple of them  or something like that  so maybe we could  you know give this bit  to the Spanish station  on XM  so they can play it  a few times  so the only way  this is going to make sense  is to play the  Bill's Dead phone call  again 
[01:17:30]  I know it's kind of  overplayed  but it is one of our  favorites  basically this old lady  called uh  uh  one of the old  stations we worked at  wrong number  wrong number  and we messed with her  a little bit  by telling her  her dear friend  Bill was dead  a little bit  so we're going to  play the original  and then we'll come  back for a quick second  and we'll play  the Spanish version  alright  alright  but first year's  the original  hello  hi  hi  Bill  who's this  Pat  hi Pat  how are you  now this is  the wrong Bill 
[01:18:00]  uh  well Pat  I have some bad news  what  uh  Bill  uh  Bill died today  yeah  oh my god  yeah  tragic  who's this  he was in a car  accident today  oh no  who is this  John  John  yeah  oh boy  oh my god

[01:21:30]  Dunday.  Just to know it.  Dunday.  Dunday.  It's a bit twice as long because we have to try to do it in Spanish.  I know.  Our awful Spanish.  Un accidento.  Un accidento.  Un accidento.  Un accidento.  Were you French?  Well, I took a little French, too, in high school, so I got it all mixed up, I guess.  Rubbed off a little bit.  A little bit, a little bit.  All right.  Well, there you have that.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:22:00]  Ah, freakish birth defects on the way on the Opie and Anthony program.  Speaking of which.  A freakish defects or a program?  Or a program.  No, keep going.  Freakish.  Jerking off together.  Oh.  Remember that time in L.A. when we were interviewing the mommies?  The mommies.  Aren't they the women that do the Reynolds rap commercials?  Oh, that's what they do now?  Is that them?  Yeah, that's the mommies.  Well, back in the day they had a TV show and we were interviewing them and I was telling  them a cute little story about you and I possibly jerking off together. 
[01:22:30]  We didn't.  But you were trying to get them nervous and make them think we did.  Yeah, because we had a...  We weren't sharing a hotel room.  Yeah, we were.  That was back in the old days.  Motherfucker.  We didn't have a crew.  We didn't have people carrying our bags.  We didn't have...  Sweets.  Jesus.  This is my suite.  It was a room with, yeah, two, like, twin beds.  And you were saying that, yeah, if we felt the urge to jack, we could hang a sheet up 
[01:23:00]  between the two beds.  Nope.  What?  I said when we were lonely, because our chicks weren't around, we would make a pact that  we would whack off in the same room together.  Yeah.  No eye contact and we would just look forward at the TV.  Don't look.  Don't look.  Just look at the TV.  And they were horrified, remember?  I'm horrified just listening to this.  All right.  Well, freakish birth defects on the Opie and Anthony program.  Check this out.  The worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:23:30]  Awful.  There's a couple of cute little stories in the news, too.  They're helping out the mermaid baby.  Have you seen that story?  Aw, that's so cute.  Isn't that an endearing little thing for a child?  The mermaid baby.  Aw.  Dude, have you seen this?  I love when they give these cute little names to freaks of nature that should just be shot  in the head and buried out back.  I buried the little feller. 
[01:24:00]  Poor little mermaid.  Poor little.  What kind of box do you put her in?  Are we getting the stripper surprise story?  I put her in a shoebox.  No, I mean, we're getting the audio because they got the interview.  Oh, cool.  We'll do that, too.  Poor little feller.  Poor little feller.  You haven't seen the mermaid baby?  No, I guess we're not breaking because I have to find out now.  That the legs are connected from, I guess, the snatch all the way down to the ankles. 
[01:24:30]  You've got two leg bones, but everything else is fused together.  Was this in a real paper?  I swear to you.  Yeah, he's right.  Did it say AP?  No.  It's right there on, look, on 1010wins.com, so you know it's true.  It has to be real.  It's funny you said all the way from her snatch.  Well, now you have to describe it.  But it's like, you know, they give these cute little names.  Mermaid Baby.  Oh, my God! 
[01:25:00]  Little Ariel.  Holy crap!  That can't be real.  Kid with water on the brain.  Oh, look, it's little Pez dispenser kid, we call him.  You know, you've got to give cute names to him.  All right, so-called mermaid baby undergoes operation.  Peruvian surgeons.  We're going to cure the little kid with elephantitis in a ball sack.  Well, we call them hippity-hop balls.  No, we're going to give him glasses and make him a producer.  Muss his hair up a bit. 
[01:25:30]  Give him 20,000 cups of coffee.  So they have to, like, slit her legs up.  That was the operation they did?  And, yeah, they say that she's got 15 years of surgery to go.  What?  They have to, yeah, because the bones get fused, and everything gets, like, fused together.  So they've got to slit her.  And then as she grows, I guess they've got to do things with leg bones. 
[01:26:00]  That's all cute, but let's get really into this.  Are they going to make her a badge?  Are they going to slit her a slit?  How about an answer to some of the questions that we don't know about that they never give?  Right.  Is it fused all the way up to her snatch?  It has to be, or she would be bloated by now.  And now what do you do?  Do you build her a new one?  Is that, like, inside her thighs right now?  And you've got to cut it and then build one?  And who decides how tight it's going to be? 
[01:26:30]  The doc.  How big the lips are.  All right, Jesus, Jimmy.  So you can't put these on.  They'll see them through panties.  I know.  I want you to model them after these bratwursts.  Slap these together and take a look.  That's what we need.  Two bratwursts and a grape on them.  I want you to use Abner Louima's lips. 
[01:27:00]  Just slap them in there.  Oh, Christ.  Yeah, they had a girl on one of the talk shows yesterday.  Who had had the surgery done years ago.  And she's, you know, her legs look really weird.  Like her thighs were really skinny.  But her calves were really fat.  Ah, good, good, good, good, good.  She had, like, the Popeye thing going on.  But I guess, you know, it's better than having to go through life as the mermaid person. 
[01:27:30]  There's not much of a mermaid look to it, though.  The mermaid's hot.  The best freak baby ever, though.  We did, like, three hours on it.  Baby without a face?  No.  Baby without a face.  No.  Jimmy, anyone else want to guess?  Faceless baby was the worst thing to look at.  That thing was popular a few months back.  And everyone was emailing it around.  And you click on the picture and just, it's baby without a face.  And the father is holding it up, like, nuzzling.  Yeah.  This just chopped meat, pile of chopped meat in the front. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, God, that was awful.  There it is, Opie.  Look.  Oh, my God.  Okay, it's attached.  I don't see any ass.  I don't see no ass.  Where does it crap?  Wow, that's got, wow.  Does it crap out of a little hole like a fish where that brown string just comes out?  I think it's all collecting in the little baby's thighs.  Look at that.  That's all, that's all, like.  Do you see ass?  No, no ass.  There's no ass crack or nothing?  No.  It's fused all the way from the hips down.  Oh, wait, no, no.  It's just an Asian baby.  Go to the next one. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, it's sideways.  I didn't look.  Well, let's go to Tony the trucker.  Tony, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How's it going this morning?  We're having a good time.  Hey, yeah, y'all just switched on that.  I was just going to mention that show that was on TV about that mermaid baby.  They had that older girl, I guess, that had gone through the operation.  But, yeah, that was pretty messed up, man.  It had some fucked up looking legs.  But y'all already touched on it, so I'll just punch out and listen. 
[01:29:00]  All right, thanks, Tony.  Let's go to Free Rider.  Free Rider, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  The urinary tract and the genitalia and all that stuff is fused together as well.  So they have to construct their own genitalia.  So how does the baby get rid of any waste?  I don't know.  The reason she's been waiting so long is she's had so many urinary tract infections.  That they've had to wait to kind of fix to make sure all the infections go down first.  Well, how's this stuff getting out of her?  Yeah, I have no idea. 
[01:29:30]  Maybe they put a bag on her or something.  And I'm going three days without any movements.  And I look like a bloated Ethiopian kid.  And I can't imagine that she's going a lot longer than me.  They squeeze her like toothpaste and it comes out this little slit in her ankles.  All right, punch her out.  All right.  Anyway.  She blasts one here down by her feet.  Because her feet aren't fused together.  So there's like, it looked to be some type of opening by her ankles. 
[01:30:00]  No, that can't be.  Take a look at the picture.  No, I know.  There's a little hole in the back that just trickles out of.  You think?  There's got to be some little clumsy, messy back legs.  Where do you get pampers with just one hole for the leg?  One big hole.  A pamper.  A pamper.  Why can't they address that?  You know what I mean?  We want to know.  What's going on now?  We want to know.  Any time there's some kind of medical malfunction like this, they never answer the things you 
[01:30:30]  really want answered.  You see Siamese twins that are connected from the hip up, where they share everything from  the hips down.  I want to know how they deal with having sex and stuff.  They have two different brains.  All right, there you go.  You finally figured out the craziest freakish baby ever.  Yeah.  The two-headed twins, or I don't even know what, I don't know if they're officially twins.  With the crab, they look like a crab.  No, no, no, no.  Oh, those were the brothers in Chicago.  The brothers were connected at the hip and their torso, but they had four legs. 
[01:31:00]  Right.  And four arms.  Right.  So they're two different people up top.  They fuse into one person, and then right at the hips, they come back into two people.  Right.  So they had four legs, and they showed them playing baseball.  Right.  And they were running, and it looked like some freakish crab running down the baseline.  Frightening.  The best part was the one brother would hit, and the other brother would catch.  Yeah, he was the catcher for the team, while the other brother hit. 
[01:31:30]  And the guy was out every time.  Oh, you silly goose, you're out again.  You just have to throw it to the brother.  He's right there to make the catch.  Throw it to me.  I'm on him.  And, of course, the dumb announcers have to say stuff like, you could be whatever you want.  You could play ball if you want.  My dream is to play for the Chicago Cubs.  Yeah.  Really.  Sure it is.  Jesus.  They're going to put some freakish crab man, two-headed crab man on the team.  You know what, though? 
[01:32:00]  Sell tickets.  I was going to say, attendance would go way up.  Mr., what was his name there, Vec?  Yeah.  He knew.  He knew.  That guy knew.  Freakish.  What is that you're showing me, Eric?  That's another picture of the baby.  The baby's cute, though.  Cute little baby.  Anthony, anyway.  Whoa.  What?  A little malegros.  Let's see.  Weighs 14 pounds.  Measures 25 inches long, about the size and weight of a normal six-month-old baby.  Um, but, uh, malegros has suffered frequent urinary infections because, hold on, kids, 
[01:32:30]  her, uh, urinary tract, anus, and genitals end in the same opening, almost like a sewer.  It says it right here.  Almost like a sewer.  So is it like a bird?  Like, birds have, like, one thing just come out of liquid and solid.  Yeah, when it hits your car, it's just shit and piss, and it's all over your windshield.  Yeah, it's probably the same thing. 
[01:33:00]  This whole, yuck, just comes out.  In the last three months, doctors inserted a silicone bag filled with saline to stretch  the skin so it would be able to cover her legs once they're cut apart.  She also has a deformed left kidney, very small right one, located very low in her body.  What happened here?  I don't know.  If this mother didn't deserve a push down the old staircase, the old hacienda.  Wow.  Let's go to Ken in Jacksonville. 
[01:33:30]  Ken, what's up?  Just bouncing off the aracotta tile floor.  They figured out since the baby can't shit, they nicknamed it Old Gravy Baby.  Punch it out, boys.  That's almost really funny.  Old Gravy Back.  Old Gravy Back.  Old Gravy Leg.  Wow.  All right.  So it's called Mermaid Syndrome, huh?  Yeah, they have to give it cute names like that.  Condition occurs in one out of every 70,000 births. 
[01:34:00]  One in 70,000?  That sounds kind of common.  And there are only three known cases of children with the affliction alive in the world today.  They probably die right away.  Something tells me that isn't the only affliction.  Well, Anthony, yes, the deformity is almost always fatal within days of delivery due to serious defects to vital organs.  Yeah.  But Milagros, whose name means miracles in Spanish, has survived.  Of course it does.  Yeah, that's a real miracle.  Thank you, Lord. 
[01:34:30]  Deliver that mess.  I saw a lady in the comedy cellar probably about a month ago upstairs in the restaurant.  She was the most awful-looking person I've ever seen.  She had, it looked like her, she looked like a scream mask.  Her mouth looked like it was three or four inches, maybe two inches wide with buck teeth.  And it looked like someone had taken her face and stretched it like taffy and then caved it in.  It was like a half a parenthesis almost. 
[01:35:00]  It was, her chin might have been an inch wide.  I'm like, this, how did she make it to adulthood?  And who was her friend out with her pretending that, yeah, it's nice to just have coffee with you.  And look at that awful face.  Holy Jesus.  I couldn't even laugh at her.  At the comedy club?  Dude, I couldn't, it was upstairs at the restaurant.  I couldn't even elbow a comic and go look at that.  There's something so heinous out there that you can't, yeah, you can't laugh.  I can't even look sometimes.  It's really horrible when you, and they sometimes get you by surprise. 
[01:35:30]  You're just wheeling your shopping cart at the supermarket and you're turned down an aisle  and you're staring horror right in the face.  Oh my God, what happened?  Teeth that are sticking straight out at you.  What?  What happened?  I really wanted to take this one home and bang her.  Out of mercy.  Put it in that awful mouth?  Yeah, we'll just caress that bent face and little tiny chin.  Caress all tiny chin.  And once she gets you a little tear in her eye because somebody is finally holding her 
[01:36:00]  the way she wants to be held.  Oh no.  You drill your fist in her face and go, now get out, ugly.  Oh my God.  You just.  Oh, you're horrible.  You're just not nice.  Oh my God.  Let's go to Dave in Detroit.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, how are you doing today, guys?  We're having a lot of fun today.  Hey, no doubt.  I used to be a rehabilitation counselor, how people get jobs.  So you need to get all the specs on these people, what their problems was.  So I had this report coming on this guy that he had a job where he had to be right next 
[01:36:30]  to the toilet.  So when he came to my office, I asked him why, and he said, well, I was born without  an asshole.  And essentially, instead of having a colostomy, his dad had a doctor's drill in there.  So he had no way of controlling his shit.  It just would go whenever because he had no muscles there.  Oh, he had no like sphincter or anything that, you know, keeps you from just crapping  when you have crap there.  You could just fall out.  So he would go to the bathroom when he just felt like he was coming on?  Whenever he couldn't control it. 
[01:37:00]  So he basically had to be able to work.  He could run right to the toilet at that point.  The guy also refused to wear any type of diaper as well.  It's pretty bad.  Are we ready to call shenanigans on this guy?  That sounds a little odd.  I would think there would be a colostomy bag on that guy.  And he hung up.  And he hung up.  Yeah.  All right.  What is Parasite Head all about?  Parasite Head?  AJ in Delaware.  That doesn't sound like an endearing, fun little name for a child.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  The other day on, I think it was on Oprah or some nonsense, they had a baby with a parasitic  head.  It had an additional head, but no body attached to it. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, I saw that.  It was like half the Siamese twins.  Freakish.  It was like almost half a head growing out of the other head.  Like that character in South Park?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where it had like conjoined twin head.  And the eyes kind of try to open every once in a while?  Dude, the eyes.  Yeah, the eyes were open.  And the mouth and nose would twitch and it would move.  But it couldn't talk or anything?  No.  I wonder if there was a brain in there going, ah, this blows.  It was just retarded. 
[01:38:00]  Big retard head.  Oh, and it had a little thin mustache and couldn't get food orders right.  Anyway, the freakish, the best one ever was the two little girls, two heads on one body.  Oh, yeah.  One complete body.  I think 20, 20 or 60 Minutes, one of them did a whole piece on them.  We talked about them for hours.  Had wider shoulders than a normal person.  Right.  And had two heads on one body. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  She had everything.  Besides the two heads, yeah.  Well, are they both thinking separate like heads?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  No, they were totally there.  Had, yeah, complete brain function and did what normal girls do.  Oof.  And the only difference besides the two heads, like Anne said, they had broader shoulders.  But everything else went down to a V, and they had two legs, two arms, and they swam.  And now, you know.  The creepiest scene ever, they showed them on a bike, just riding a bike with two heads. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, really weird.  Like, woo!  We're having fun.  That was really weird.  What do you do?  Yeah, that's what we were saying.  It's like, can you imagine one girl is like, you know, like wants to save herself for marriage,  and the other girl's a slut?  Or how about they both fall in love with two different people and get married?  And what do you do?  How do the guys handle it?  Right.  You're sharing a snatch.  You're sharing the snatch.  You're kissing one of the heads.  You're playing with one tit.  And then the other guy is sleeping right next to you because he's married to her. 
[01:39:30]  And then you climb aboard, do your stuff.  What are they, flip a coin?  Like, you and Voss?  And then when the one you're banging dozes off, do you go to the other one, psst?  Just suck it.  Yeah, you could, you're like, as you're banging, do you turn to the other head and go, I'm fucking  you now.  Yeah.  You just let her know?  Like, hey, hey, no you're not. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, I'm fucking you now.  It doesn't make any sense.  Those are the questions you need.  One on your balls, one on the helmet.  There's a lot of stuff you can do with that.  Date that creature in a second.  Two mouths, no way to creature.  Date that creature.  How come I always have to eat the ass first?  Hush, hush, now.  Oh.  Flip her over, stare on the back of two heads in the pillow.  Oh.  One's going, ooh, and one's going, ouch, ouch, I don't like this.  Take it all. 
[01:40:30]  Those are the questions.  That's the questions.  You need answers, too.  Those are the questions.  You're right.  Glenn on Long Island, what's up?  Hey, Opie Anthony.  Hey.  Sweet tits, how you doing, guys?  All right.  I got this guy by my house.  He looks like the elephant man.  He's got his freaking eyes all out of place.  He's got part of his brain hanging out, and I'm telling you, I'm right on my bike with my  daughter.  He sees this guy, she starts screaming. 
[01:41:00]  He's freaking unbelievable, man.  He's fucking scary as anything.  Did he get shot?  I didn't get shot, you know.  No, did he get shot?  I mean, why is his head all messed up?  I have no idea.  He just looks like one of these circus freaks.  Oh, wow.  You know, and I keep walking around with the digital camera waiting for him to come out  again.  He walks around in like a hospital uniform, you know, like he's an outpatient or something.  An outpatient or something.  All right, we're going to try one more before we go to break. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, no.  He hung up.  Oh, what about Jerry?  He hung up.  Oh.  Jerry.  Oh, okay.  What, sweetie?  What?  Tell me.  Jerry.  Yo.  Jerry.  It's my pride and joy.  Jerry, what's up, man?  How are you doing today?  Yeah, Mike was born with something called a hypostadia or something like that.  A what?  A hypostadia.  And what is that?  It's where your penis is split from the tip to the base when he's born.  Oh.  So what do you do? 
[01:42:00]  It is, first off, very disturbing when he came out.  You're looking at it and you're like, um, there's something wrong here, Doc.  And he's like, yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Wait, so it's split like a wound or it's healed?  It's healed, but it looks really like if you take a bra first and you cut it in half.  And it kind of curls?  Yeah.  Kind of curls away from itself?  Yes, it does.  It's really disturbing. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, and what do they do?  They're going to have surgery at the end of this month to get it fixed.  Do they have one little urethra?  Does he, like, urinate out of one side of it?  Actually, the hole that you pee out of his urethra is down.  So when he pees, he pees down.  Oh, I thought you're constantly cleaning off the wall.  No, no, no, no.  This pees, it's really disturbing.  White men speaking with fork cock.  You get douche chills, that's all.  Well, is it a big one? 
[01:43:00]  No, not really.  You really can't tell because it's in two pieces.  So has the doctor, like, shown you pictures of what this looks like after they fix it?  Um, if they haven't told me how they're going to fix it, and I really don't want to know how they're going to fix it because it's just a little bit too, ugh.  Like I said, whenever you start talking about it, you're getting up with those nice chills down your back.  Holy jeez.  What kind of drugs did you or your wife do?  None.  That's the worst thing.  And they couldn't see that in, like, a sonogram?  No, they didn't see nothing like that until it was too late. 
[01:43:30]  Holy mother of God.  Well, it's not exactly what you're expecting.  Can he get a rod?  I don't know.  Test it out.  He's not that far.  He's only five months old, so.  Jesus.  Well, no, without being dirty or anything, kids are known to get rods.  Yeah, you.  Yeah, but, you know, like I say, I'm just disturbing.  Now, we're all important in the totality.  If you don't care like I care, I don't need you guys to take my money. 
[01:44:00]  Just like that guy last night that fucked up my crew and was short labor.  I lost out $20,000 or $30,000 because my crew got fucked.  Do you understand?  Do you understand where I'm coming from with integrity?  And you guys are better at the same thing because you're all replacing.  Do you all like your jobs?  Do you want your jobs?  Do you?  Then you better protect his.  Because if that happens again, he does not have that job.  Do you understand?  And you better make it right.  If you don't do the job, you're gone.  And that goes for everybody. 
[01:44:30]  That's just the fucking way it is.  Because you've got to do good.  And as long as you've got it good, you've got to make it good.  Get it fucking right.  That's just the way it is around here.  Do you understand that?  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  Hey, what's going on?  This is Bill Burr.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  XM282.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  First show at WBAB.  I don't think we ever really played that.  Nah, 30 seconds of it. 
[01:45:00]  We got 30 seconds until we were both too embarrassed to go any further.  Basically, what you're about to hear, Rich Voss and Dave Mordal were in studio, and we decided  to play the first show that Anthony and I did together at WBAB about 10 years ago.  We got about 30 seconds to a minute into this, and we just couldn't handle it anymore, and  I think that's what you're about to hear.  Eventually, we will play the entire first show that Anthony and I did together.  Yeah, it's awful.  What did Anthony say that was so happy?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I know.  I'm so eager to please, and I'm so happy to be there. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, I just laughed at me.  Shut up, Jimmy.  Jovial.  I do stink.  And I sound perfect.  Yeah, you do.  Hey, BAB.  It's awful.  Welcome to BAB.  Hey, thanks for tuning in, everybody.  That's not how I did it.  Two happy Joes.  Bring in your comedy tapes from 10 years ago.  I've done it.  They're atrocious.  From three years ago, they're awful.  I'm sure you need to have a Gilligan's Island joke on there somewhere. 
[01:46:00]  Never.  I was never clever enough to write one.  All right.  Listen to this, and we'll be back.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Well, we have a bunch of things we could go to.  We could either do psycho ex-girlfriend phone calls.  I thought we were going to listen to your first show.  You guys are really putting that off.  I know.  I know.  We have.  You guys really are.  It's so embarrassing.  You know what it is?  Opie is doing the rock jock thing, because that's what he was doing.  He was doing the rock jock.  Right.  It was the first show we ever did together.  I was just a construction worker out on Long Island who did a few impressions and song parodies. 
[01:46:30]  So I come on to the show, and I'm just, I listened back to this recently.  I'm too happy to be there.  I'm like, oh, I really had to pound down a few beers and stuff, so I'm pretty hammered.  And to listen to it, I'm just, I'm over laughing and just like, I'm just too happy to be there.  And it's so embarrassing.  Did we hear some of it a couple minutes ago?  I want to hear some.  I've never heard of it.  This is so cringy.  Was Voss on there doing his sprint joke? 
[01:47:00]  No, this goes back like 11 years.  Voss was sucking cock for crack on 168th Street.  I just use that as a term.  You know what I'm saying.  Yeah, whatever.  19 years ago.  Voss is like Yogi Berra.  Should we go to this?  Look at me, stolen some more.  Steve in Jersey.  Steve.  You?  What's up?  Go ahead.  Yo, dude, I'm Voss, man.  You know, you kind of sound just like fucking Yogi Berra with his stupid things.  What's he saying?  What do you say?  What do you mean by that, sir?  I didn't hear it.  I feel like Yogi Berra fucking, you know, when there's a fork in the road, take it. 
[01:47:30]  Yogi Berra was well known for that kind of stuff.  For what?  I like how Opie just wrecks everyone's spot, though, on the call.  Because the whole joke is for him to call up and go, hey, Voss, you like Yogi Berra.  Opie goes, let's go to Steve in Jersey who says Voss is like Yogi Berra.  All right, Steve.  Yeah, Voss, you like Yogi Berra.  Opie just ruins the guy's mic and killed him.  Look at him.  He thinks you're talking about the cartoon character.  No, it's the guy, the baseball guy.  But what's he saying?  How am I like Yogi Berra?  Yeah, that's what he's thinking.  Well, he's in the Hall of Fame.  Is that what he's saying? 
[01:48:00]  I think he is, isn't he?  Yes.  Yeah, he's in the Hall of Fame.  He's a Hall of Famer.  I kill on stage.  I'm smarter than the average mongoloid.  I kill.  Oh, she's just going for the coffee.  I thought she was going to slam you again.  She's hot.  She's funny, man.  We all acknowledge that your wife-to-be is hot.  She's funny hot.  We got to see her boobs today.  That was a special treat for everybody.  Yeah, she did that for everybody.  You didn't see?  No.  Miss everything.  She's a team player.  One time I did a tough crowd and we had to do a message to the troops. 
[01:48:30]  I remember that.  For the female troops, I flashed my breasts, this is.  Yeah.  But before I did it, I had to check them in the mirror in the green room to make sure that  I would arch my back properly or whatever.  And Norton was on the show and he didn't know that I was going to do it.  He just walked by and saw me checking my boobs in the mirror.  Like, I just do that before every show.  A little show prep.  Sad thing is Norton had his nuts up around his belly button at the top. 
[01:49:00]  Look what I can do.  Show and tell in the green room.  See, they're not all killers.  No, they're not.  See what happens?  You get greedy and you wear yourself thin and that's where I come in.  I shouldn't have done the stuff you wrote.  That's all.  I'm rubbing your glue.  I'm sorry.  That's very juvenile.  So I'd like to hear a little bit of this for a show.  Everyone's just bitching on instant feedback.  Just a little bit.  Stop it.  It is really uncomfortable. 
[01:49:30]  I can't watch my own first open mic tape.  I understand.  It's just too cringe.  Vos showed his old tape.  I showed my old tape.  All right.  Here we go.  We need an hour and a half with this stuff.  We'll only hear in a minute of this.  That's all a couple minutes.  Here we go.  It's a preview.  Ant and I doing our first radio show together.  Yes.  It's 11 years ago.  Close to 11 years ago.  Please just keep that in mind.  Rock shock.  Oh, I can't even look.  It's going to get bad.  I can't even look. 
[01:50:00]  Long Island's best rocked up with UBAB, Soul Asylum.  Black Gold, Steve Miller, and the latest from R.E.M.  What's the frequency, Kenneth?  As you do the nighttime attitude, it's Opie aboard.  Thanks for checking out the program tonight.  And we've got another fine show planned for you guys tonight.  We've got my pals Joe and Anthony from Rotgut live in the studio.  How you doing, man?  Good, man.  Just in case people don't know who you are yet.  Yeah, well, that happens all the time.  They are the famous authors of Gun Electric Shock OJ, which you're going to do live on the 
[01:50:30]  show tonight.  That's right.  And you're going to do other ditties.  Yeah.  Other wacky booty stuff, Opie.  I have to be putting on a voice every second I'm on the air.  I have to be over the top.  Oh, this is the worst.  It's just painful to listen to.  What was wrong with that?  It was kind of like, hey, Opie, how you doing?  Shut up.  You're too happy to be there.  You think I'm going to be able to hang up my wrench after this night.  That's pretty much what I'm thinking. 
[01:51:00]  They're going, you know what?  No one's going to make this work a maintenance man.  You know?  Yeah, but you guys made it, so it's not that bad.  It's really not that bad.  Awful.  Let's hear more.  I think that was pretty good.  I kind of like the music.  Shut up, Jimmy.  Jimmy's just wincing in the corner listening to this.  Yeah, other wacky, kooky stuff.  We're a little bitter.  We gave Eddie better the idea to do that.  Yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  That's what someone just said.  You know, they heard Pearl Jam's version of Sitting on the Dock of the Bay, and they were expecting  to hear the OJ version.  He sounded like he was heavily sedated, Pearl Jam. 
[01:51:30]  All right, I need a ruling.  I started a new bid yesterday.  Celebrity death wise.  Right?  Yep.  All right, you might have heard this.  You know what?  Hey, what?  In 11 years, you went from boring host to boring host.  Jesus Christ.  You're consistent, and that's very important.  Yes, thank you.  Very horrific.  Stern will never say that you guys copied from the beginning for this.  God damn. 
[01:52:00]  Can you rewind that just a little bit?  Are you sweating?  I am sweating.  I'm sweating over here.  I'm all hot.  I'm sweating so bad.  It's horrible.  You're really sincere and genuine.  It's awful.  I hear like five seconds back, because you say something about the celebrity thing, and I think  you were smiling.  Fuck you, Jimmy.  Shut up.  It's a great idea.  It sucks.  Wait.  Eat me.  I want to get the response.  It's very good.  It sounded like it was heavily sedated, Pearl.  All right, I need a ruling. 
[01:52:30]  I started a new bid yesterday.  Celebrity death wise.  Right?  Yep.  All right.  You might have been...  Right?  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It'll be all right.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  Oh.  Have another drink, you alcoholic.  Oh, God.  So, hey, when did it, like, change for you guys?  When we...  When...  When...  I guess when we stopped really giving a fuck.  Yeah.  I guess when you started asking...  Well...  Stop asking for rulings, right?  Right?  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Shut up, Jimmy.  John, you suck.  Oh, he's pounding me.  Well, back then, we still had to listen to bosses, so you had to do all this stuff. 
[01:53:00]  I wasn't even employed.  I'm sure that somebody put you up to this.  Well...  I wasn't even employed by the station.  I was just a guy that was coming in off the street.  Kind of like Boss.  He's not.  Just...  I had street smarts.  And I was coming in just hoping to make something of it.  He wouldn't fix appliances for airtime at the studio.  He was the maintenance guy.  I was not.  No, he wasn't.  I was...  That's a bad story.  You went from maintenance guy to satellite radio.  Air conditioning and heating.  I installed air conditioning ductwork, but not at the station. 
[01:53:30]  And then I had a band that did song parodies, so I came in, and what I was trying, like  my dream and goal was to get on the air full-time and make a living of it.  So, any time I was on the air, I was so happy, happy to be there, that I was so over the  top, and it's just awful.  Right?  Yep.  Shut up.  That's not bad.  That's not bad.  I like asking...  Can I hear that question?  No.  I actually like that point.  I think it's a nice chemistry...  No! 
[01:54:00]  Stop it!  I can't take this.  All right, I need a ruling.  I started a new bit yesterday.  Celebrity death watch.  Right?  Yep.  All right, you might have heard this last night.  Monday, Jessica Tandy, the old broad from Driving Miss Daisy, died.  Hey, I'll take that contract.  How old is she?  How old is she?  How old is she?  I can't.  What?  No, no, it's really good.  That was a good one.  Shut up.  She's dead.  You'll take the contract.  You'll take the contract.  I get it.  I can see what they saw in these two right out of the chute. 
[01:54:30]  Absolutely.  What the hell were they thinking?  No.  I think it's really good.  No.  This is so bad.  I can't...  Hey, it's opening in the air conditioning, guys.  How did that not come up?  I like that phone.  You've got to go do those different...  Make little train jokes or carrier.  I'm six minutes away from walking off this show, man.  Maybe your compressor's broken, but I think...  Bruce Kelly is laughing at us.  I like the agreeing, though.  You guys make Don and Mike sound like, oh, fuck!  I forgot his show name. 
[01:55:00]  It was supposed to be good for you, yeah, fuck.  Right?  Yep.  Yeah, but what's it say about the other guys that are out there when you were a maintenance  guy and now you have your own show?  I mean, that's amazing.  That's really amazing.  Way to look at it, Dave.  Way to look at it.  And is so cloyingly happy to be there.  Where he's like one of the Jews in Schindler's List.  I invite her to the war effort.  Well, you guys don't need to hear anymore, right?  I'd love to hear some more of this.  This is good stuff, because back then, this was over the edge, over the top.  Take that contract.  How old was it? 
[01:55:30]  It's 85.  Oh, please.  Anyways, I don't know about you, but I've always been under the...  Celebrities die in threes, basically.  Always.  Always, right?  So it's the celebrity death watch.  I guarantee two more prominent celebrities will die before October 1st.  So we're just waiting and watching.  Celebrities die in threes, but radio hosts die in threes.  I like the stuttering that you brought into it.  That was good.  Everybody knows celebrities die in threes.  Oh, my God. 
[01:56:00]  No, I really liked it.  I'm sure.  I really liked it.  I want to find a hole to bury it.  I really enjoyed this.  You should sell this CD.  It's already on the Internet.  I'd like to hear a little more.  I would like to hear more.  I would really like to hear more.  Yeah, you've got to remember, this was our first show together.  Absolutely.  Our first show together.  It's good stuff.  No.  George Burns in the hospital the other day.  It was a close call.  Very close call.  But he got out of it.  98 years old.  He has, like, his brain is swelling.  And he pulled out.  And he pulled out of it.  I was like, darn.  I always wanted to see. 
[01:56:30]  What are you, the lady from Misery?  Darn.  Did you shake your fist in the air?  Did you?  Wow.  Happy cook.  This is very difficult.  When this was taped, Gina Lola Bridget had only been dead for 22 years.  Darn.  This isn't fun when it's you.  Oh, this is so fast.  Right?  Yep.  Darn.  Darn.  Got it.  The goofus in Gallon Hour.  Yep.  Right?  Good point.  Good point.  Shucks.  Can I say shucks in the air? 
[01:57:00]  He shoot too strong a word.  Oh, we're in trouble now.  We've P.O.ed the bosses.  The day after this is when Bob Grant got so angry.  I really want to hear more of that.  Well, that's all.  No, I want to hear more of that.  That's all I brought in.  You've got to have an hour of that stuff.  Oh, come on.  Oh, really?  Darn.  I always wanted to see George Burns singing that extreme song.  If you don't like what you see here, get the funk out.  But he never does that. 
[01:57:30]  I turned back around.  You kind of said funk like the other word.  Yeah, yeah.  That was very blue.  That was George Burns doing Carson there.  I cannot even take this.  Why?  Because it's just too embarrassing.  It's embarrassing.  It's good stuff.  Did you guys use this as a demo tape?  Holy shit.  This is why you got fired in Boston.  Actually, we used a lot of this and two other shows we did to get our job in Boston.  No, Funko.  As a demo tape?  I'll try to find a demo.  What do we take over for? 
[01:58:00]  Really?  Terry Shivo.  I can't imagine anyone listening to this and going, yeah, this is the show we want.  Well, maybe that interview about the Star Trek convention was on just ahead of it.  Yeah, what happened was my batteries were dying.  That's what happened.  All right, well, listen.  No, I really, actually, I mean, for 11 years ago, it's pretty good.  Yeah, yeah.  No, I know.  Maybe now, after he's bopped on the head.  But I need a ruling.  I got an obituary.  Patrick O'Neill, 66.  People are going, Patrick who? 
[01:58:30]  Now, I said it has to be a prominent celebrity.  This guy was in Stepford Wives, 1975.  What do you think?  It's on the fence.  Is he prominent?  Let me see, Joe.  What do you think?  I rule me.  I rule me.  All right, so it's still one with two celebrities to go two weeks from now.  Two to go.  Two to go.  All right.  Well, we're going to debut real fast a song from Rodgut about the Cuban refugees.  Right.  There was a Billy Joel made a tribute to the Baymen.  Right.  And we figured, you know, why not go to the other southern half of the states and make a 
[01:59:00]  little tribute to the Cuban boat people?  I can't even stand listening to this.  I like the music bed playing underneath it.  Oh, there's got to be music bed playing in the background.  I don't know what that is.  That's a law.  How did you cash the paycheck?  How did the...  Just cashed it.  That's amazing.  How did the four fans keep up with all those rulings?  How many rulings do you do a day?  I need another ruling.  I need a ruling.  Oh, he's reciting over the show.  He's not going to figure it.  I know. 
[01:59:30]  I need a ruling.  You should have had like a gavel that would come down.  Too late now.  That was 11 years ago.  I bring you news from the north.  Opie needs a ruling.  Yes.  I bring you news.  The Opie and Rusty Burrell Show.  Here's your ruling.  Get off the air.  What are you, Judge Wapner?  I want to hear more.  I really enjoy it.  I like hearing all this stuff.  I'm going to go on break.  I need a ruling.  How many people should think...  You know something?  What?  In all the years we've been doing radio, and I've been in the barrel quite a few times, 
[02:00:00]  this is the worst ever.  Yeah, you shouldn't have even brought this up.  You should never have brought this up.  It's not even bad.  Shut up, Jimmy.  It's not even bad.  Jimmy is wincing and laughing at him.  Hold on.  I have often wondered what George Burns would sound like singing a song, and thank God,  I finally know.  Because he's an old codger.  He's going to be able to sleep tonight, finally, Jimmy is.  Oh, 85.  Sign me up.  There's about 10 people to rule.  Let's take a ruling on how good this is.  I'd like to hear more of it.  I really would.  Some people are speculating that in 11 years, even Pat from Unaki has a special of having 
[02:00:30]  a radio career.  Darn.  This is going to be a cliffhanger.  It's a cliffhanger.  You're listening to the soothing sounds of Obi and Anthony.  So sit back, relax, have yourself some herbal tea, close your eyes, and drift away with ONA.  Hey, ass pot.  Hi.  This is great.  You dick.  Bye, aye, aye. 
[02:01:00]  Shut up.  Shut up.  Fuck all y'all.  Horrific and tasteless.  It's called sarcasm.  I've never heard anything as offensive and gross as you are.  And that's why I'm signing up.  The Unaki and Anthony Show.  Boss, eBay, car.  Rolls Royce.  Part one.  Moron.  And part two.  Hit it.  Thank you.  It's the worst of Obi and Anthony.  Lo mas mal de Obi and Anthony. 
[02:01:30]  En XM2.  Cero dos.  Hey, did we finish the Rolls Royce story or did we go off on a tangent?  All right.  Idiot.  I talked to him briefly about it.  He said he paid like 26 grand.  And this is how you know you're dealing with a dummy.  For like an old car, right?  A Rolls Royce, 26 grand.  You can't get a Rolls Royce for under a quarter million.  And if it looks like it does in a picture.  Yeah, that's the way to buy an automobile, you shithead.  Look at the photo.  One dimensional picture.  Where's he going to drive it?  In Plainfield?  He really is.  Yeah, where are you going to live in fucking Jersey?  What are you going to do with a Rolls Royce in Jersey?  It's going to be a Toyota with like a shitty emblem like glued on the car. 
[02:02:00]  What's that show?  They fix your car and they put rims on it.  Pimp My Ride?  Yes, Pimp My Ride.  Voss is doing anything he can just to avoid that fucking mirror.  That eye-to-eye contact he makes with himself in the mirror and to realize.  To realize what he is.  There's nothing internal.  Yeah.  It's fucking me and a ring and a hot shit.  Now he's going to be talking about his Rolls Royce.  Now he's got a Rolls Royce.  It's going to be.  Remember when he had nothing, he was talking about how he had the Mercedes.  Now he's got the Rolls Royce. 
[02:02:30]  It's going to be unbearable.  We're going to have to hear Rolls Royce stories.  You know, I was driving along.  At least if he was black, he could run some bitches out of it or something.  Yeah.  You know, he got nothing.  Voss is going.  Here's Voss' thing.  Because Voss is such an idiot.  He's got the Rolex.  He's got the Rolls Royce.  He wants class.  Voss thinks that makes him classy.  Right.  And he probably uses the word classy a lot.  Like he watches on the waterfront.  And he goes like, I could have class.  I could be a contender.  And he thinks he's somebody.  And he's just a...  Rich, if you're listening, you're a dumb nobody.  Nobody buys the Rolls Royce off eBay. 
[02:03:00]  No one.  That's for thought.  You'd still be able to see it, shouldn't you, on eBay?  I hope it's...  They usually do that.  eBay is fencing so much stolen shit now.  Good.  It's like, people are stealing stuff.  And I was reading this article that pawn shops are upset because eBay is stealing all  their thunder because nobody's bringing the stolen shit to the pawn shop.  Yeah, and a lot of scams going on, too, where people are selling stuff that doesn't  even exist.  What are you punching in there, Ant?  For the fucking dummy?  I'm searching for fucking dummies.  How do you buy a Rolls off-line? 
[02:03:30]  I don't know.  How much was it?  $26,000, which is the going rate for a Rolls.  We've won here for $24,000.  The cheapest one I'm looking at...  What is this?  How could it be...  Probably just the bids.  $9,000?  How many miles are on a Rolls-Royce that you can sell for $24,000?  That's a $200,000 car, is it not?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're supposed to have a...  You know...  I bet it's 25 years old.  It's got... 
[02:04:00]  I bet it's 25 years old.  Not a classic.  Not old enough to be a classic, but like a 1980...  There's one, 1985 Rolls-Royce.  It's $27,900, so $28,000.  And there is one picture from the front.  Is there a picture of the minority that is going to drive you around?  No, they...  Actually...  Even if he's a Puerto Rican, your name's Jeeves.  Shut up.  Older black man, you're the best friend I ever had, Mr. Voss.  Take me the piggly wiggly. 
[02:04:30]  Mr. Voss, I'm just trying to drive you to the stove.  I've got to make water.  Now, I must say, I would love to trash this, but from the pictures, and there are plenty  of pictures, this Rolls-Royce looks very nice for $28,000.  I guarantee you there's a problem with it.  Well, there would probably be a problem.  Oh, yeah, by the way.  The fucking Rolls-Royce, man.  The bait and switch.  By the way, there's no engine.  The bait and switch. 
[02:05:00]  Here's the picture.  The one they send you.  Now, yeah, this could be the one, and this is the actual one, and they get away with it  by saying, yeah, this is the Rolls-Royce you'll be buying.  This picture was taken before the pileup.  Yeah, this was taken in 1985.  Yeah, this is actually 85.  There's a chick with a big poodle hairdo driving it.  They open the trunk.  They can't pat it in.  I see Kaja Goo Goo tapes on the scene.  That was one of the Whitesnake video.  David Copperfield, yeah, yeah.  David Copperfield.  Whatever his fucking name is, Coverdale, whatever. 
[02:05:30]  David Copperfield.  He was 80 when he made the song, anyway.  Make a career disappear.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hold on.  We're running out of show, but I have to go to the phone immediately.  Immediately you have to go to the phone.  The phone.  The phone.  Rich Voss, everybody.  Oh, Rich!  Richie!  Hey, Voss.  Hit it, hit it.  Wait.  Hold on, Rich.  We got your stage music.  Paperback, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride.  Ladies and gentlemen, give a warm welcome to Rich Voss. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, you forget to mention all his credits.  I didn't.  I think you got them all in.  Hi, Rich.  I love that song.  Hi, Butterfly.  How are you?  Of course you'll love it.  I'm on PayPal trying to get my $1,000 deposit back.  Are you?  Why?  Because this car is not what it's misrepresented.  Oh, what happened?  What happened?  Nothing.  Nothing.  First of all, when you go on a test drive, I don't think your car should break down. 
[02:06:30]  Did it break down?  It just stopped.  And then we coasted into a gas station.  This is perfect.  Oh, I got to tell you this, too.  He put gas in it.  So it started working again.  So he thinks it's a fuel pump.  But then we got in the car and there was such a mildew smell.  I go, what's that smell?  And this jackass put a box of sauerkraut and cabaspes in the trunk.  He goes, oh, no, that's just sauerkraut.  We're going, what?  And he opens the trunk and goes, yeah, I have a box of sauerkraut.  That was to hide the smell of a dead body. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, something went on in that car.  So are you going to get your $1,000 deposit back that you made on PayPal and eBay?  Why are those words you should never hear with a Rolls-Royce at the end of the sentence?  Yeah, Rolls-Royce involved.  PayPal, eBay, $1,000 deposit.  And sauerkraut.  First of all, you know what, you jackasses?  You thought you'd call me and attack me because I bought something on eBay.  eBay is the same as buying on a classified ad.  Is it really?  Yeah, it is.  I have a Saturn.  It's funny.  It's maybe not the Rolls-Royce, but it didn't break down with sauerkraut in the trunk, you 
[02:07:30]  fucking awful idiot.  Yeah, well, it's just like a classified ad.  But I said it's just like a classified ad.  Yeah.  But you can go to the house and check it out before you give a deposit.  A classified ad, you don't go, all right, meet me at my house, I'm going to give you  a grand, then we'll go check the car out, idiots.  How do you put $1,000 down, Rich, on a car you never sat in?  That's two weeks' salary for Rich Voss.  Yeah, exactly.  That's two weekends away.  And that's one day for Ralphie. 
[02:08:00]  Now, listen to me.  Rich, what happened?  Here's the thing.  I did make a mistake by putting a deposit down because I was coming to Florida anyhow.  That was my mistake.  It's in Florida?  Oh, my God.  I'm in Florida.  I'm working this year.  You don't have a better chance to get on the bus with fucking John Voight and Ratzel Rizzo  than you do of getting a fucking Rolls Royce with $26.  You know what that is?  That's a Rolls Royce.  I've got to get to Florida.  If you guys go to eBay, I'll show you the car. 
[02:08:30]  It looks beautiful on eBay.  And what does it look like in real life?  What does it look like in real life?  I don't know.  The girl that Norton was with last night, it looks horrible.  Your car has a dick?  And how?  Now, now, you guys call me to trash me about the car.  I was going to go and have a stick shift.  Yes.  Wow.  Ah, stick shift better.  Hey.  Did you guys call me to trash me about the car?  Because I did research. 
[02:09:00]  The car was going to be $26,000.  Yeah.  And I did research.  In excellent condition, what it said was it goes for $44,000 to $45,000.  Okay.  I was going to try to resell it and make some money.  Okay.  Why are you trying to dabble in finance?  He's a used car dealer.  Yeah.  He's a used car salesman now.  Why don't you call Kurt Russell?  Maybe he can blow up the car a lot across the street, owned by Jack Warden.  Hire Frank McRae to work for you.  Toby!  Was that a 26-year-old reference? 
[02:09:30]  Yes, it was.  It was fantastic, baby.  One of the best comedies ever done.  I agree.  You know, it's funny that when Norton does an old reference, it's so funny, but when  I do it, these idiots on the message boards go, I'm an asshole.  Because you were 20 when that happened.  That's the thing.  And your old references are really old, Rich.  That was a used car.  Kurt Russell's still acting.  Yeah.  What year was the roles?  It was the 88, and it only had 39,000 miles.  No, it didn't.  No, it didn't.  Sure.  It got rolled back to 39,000.  A million and 39,000. 
[02:10:00]  Yes.  You guys were just having a good time talking about Richard's little Rolls Royce deal before  I got on the air.  Well, why'd you, Rich, why'd you put a grand down?  Now, what happened with the guy?  Did he give you your money back?  He kind of said no.  Oh, my God.  How could he say no?  You don't want the car.  But PayPal said it would get the money back.  That's what PayPal said.  Why did this guy deny giving you the money back?  Because he said it would be in perfect condition once he fixes everything. 
[02:10:30]  What?  He said, you know, he goes, you bought it.  Once he fixes everything.  Oh, my God.  Well, Mr. Richard Voss, I have a perfect vehicle for you here, only used by a little old lady  to drive back and forth to get her medicine.  Ding, ding, ding.  Ding, ding.  Fuck!  You're being ripped off.  What kind of shyster?  All right, listen.  This is going to be an ongoing story, because we've just ran out of show.  I'll be on the PayPal website looking for my money. 
[02:11:00]  Sweetie, look.  I filled the ball.  You've got to respect that.  Disgusting.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony. We're on vacation, so we're playing some of this shit for you.  Shit? I remember this one. It's Richard Huff.  Actually, we played this Richard Huff a few times.  Oh, play it again.  But I'm sure we have new listeners out there that haven't heard this.  Yeah, Richard Huff writes an article about the assault on the media thing 
[02:11:30]  and how the pests are invading the space of reporters and that ONA are just being annoying.  That's right.  And we hated Richard Huff when we read this and wanted him on the phone.  And later we get him on the phone and it's a love fest, but I think that's part two.  Yeah, don't tell them it's a love fest because we want them thinking that we hate Richard Huff by the end of this one.  Here's part one, Richard Huff from the Daily News.  Pee-choo-choo-choo-boo!  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  I know.  We've got to get to the real story. Someone is in a huff today. 
[02:12:00]  Somebody is in a huff.  A huff. And what's his name?  Richard Huff.  Richard Huff is in a huff.  Richard Huff.  That's wacky.  Got to start by saying another guy playing right into our hands.  We probably shouldn't tell people this, but...  These people play into our hands perfectly.  This is exactly what we're looking for.  We're not afraid to say.  We're attention whores. 
[02:12:30]  We understand what it's going to take to make this show successful.  And it's attention.  And this is getting attention.  It's working.  This is how it started.  Assault on the media.  This is how it started, by the way.  We got to XM.  We had a lot of confidence in the marketing department.  We figured, okay, these guys are going to market the shit out of the Opie and Anthony show.  They did a lackluster job at best.  That's what we thought.  Sure.  So we decided, all right, well, we're not going to sit around and wait for them to get our names out there.  We'll have to do it ourselves once again.  Right. 
[02:13:00]  Just like we did in the old days at WNAW.  So we started this assault on the media, Anthony.  And today, Richard Huff played right into our hands, giving us huge exposure in the Daily News, a huge paper here in New York City.  Well, I just want to make sure.  Opie and Anthony, XM Satellite Radio.  Perfect.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  It's all you need.  You can call us jerks.  You can call us whatever you want.  As long as I see Opie and Anthony and XM Satellite Radio, I'm happy.  And you know something?  When you see Opie and Anthony in a news story, you know the headline is going to contain a word or two that we're familiar with from other stories. 
[02:13:30]  What is the word in this headline?  Jerks.  Jerks.  Very good.  It's never something good.  It's always jerks, idiots, buffoons.  We've seen it all.  Toxic twins.  Toxic twins.  Opie and Dopey.  Opie and Dopey, a good one.  Morons is always a good one.  Morons.  This one, jerks. 
[02:14:00]  Guy playing right into our hands.  I've got to tell you guys, the exposure is unbelievable.  It's a full-page article on our assault on the media in a section of the paper that pretty much everyone goes to.  You know, you get your newspaper.  You're not going to make it all the way to the business section, for the most part.  You're not going to make it to the comics.  You're going to fly through the headlines first, then you go to the back.  Go to the back, check out sports, check out TV talk, what have you.  The gossip.  The gossip page is always good.  I would have to say this is probably one of the most read pages in the paper every day. 
[02:14:30]  Tube talk, it's called, Anthony.  It's black and white and red all over, Opie.  It's a newspaper.  Richard Huff.  Jimmy.  Of course, he had to do a whole article on our assault on the media, Anthony.  Assault on the media.  It's working.  Which is only going to make the pests work harder.  Look, pests, you've made the news.  Very good.  Pests.  Yeah, because now the pests see this and go, oh my God, look.  Look at the attention these people got. 
[02:15:00]  I'm going to do it more.  Pests.  Pests.  Trying to get them to get away from your head.  They fly in your ear at night.  Pests.  This is only going to make it go to the next level.  Love it.  And Richard Huff understands that.  He mentions that in this article.  He can't help himself.  He knows this is only going to make it worse.  Of course.  But he is so enraged, Anthony. 
[02:15:30]  He has to write about it.  Him and his fellow journalists.  All of his colleagues are very upset by this assault on the media.  Yeah, we gave him something to write about.  I'm sure it was a slow week and he's like, oh, I'm getting a paycheck.  I've got to write about something.  Yep.  I guess I'll have to write about those dopes, Opie and Anthony, and their assault on the media.  Well, you know something, also, this is going on, a lot of talk about this is going on behind the scenes at the news organizations.  Yeah.  They're having meetings about this. 
[02:16:00]  They're having meetings on how to combat it and what to do if it happens to you.  We hear from these people that work there.  This is a big thing now and they're getting petrified.  And we'll just keep it going.  There's nothing really they can do about it.  If they're going to put a reporter out on the street somewhere and roll a camera in front of them and go live,  that whole background, unless they're going to start doing tight close-ups on their face, just their face, nothing else, 
[02:16:30]  which they're not going to do, we're going to keep doing it.  That's where we start putting the signs in front of their faces.  That's our goal, to get them to just do a close-up on their lips.  Hello.  The story today here from the subway station.  This is our campaign of fear, you douchebags.  That's right.  Our campaign of fear.  We're a little, you know, we're a little annoyed at the press.  Who isn't?  They just scare the shit out of you every night.  They scare you. 
[02:17:00]  What's in your swimming pool that could kill you at 11?  At 11?  My kids are in the pool right now, you fuck.  I'm going to take a dip.  Right.  What am I dipping in?  Why do I have to wait for 11 o'clock so you can make some money?  We'll tell you which car is being recalled for faulty brakes that could kill you.  Is it your car?  Find out at 11.  But I'm driving.  I've got to go pick up the kids right now.  The kids are, they're at practice and I, they're at the soccer field.  My brakes are, I can't just leave them there. 
[02:17:30]  Spin the wheel of death.  Take that drive before 11.  What?  That's their campaign of fear.  Here's our campaign of fear right back at you.  Will we turn up behind you?  Will you be able to keep your composure?  Or will you say fuck and lose your job?  That's the game we play now.  That's what we play.  That's our campaign of fear.  You know what's interesting too?  You guys are jerks and there's an article on this.  Jerks, it says it right there.  This scumbag, Jason Blair. 
[02:18:00]  Disgraced former New York Times reporter Jason Blair.  The guy that made up stuff, right?  Yeah, that's how he is addressed and you guys are jerks.  And this scumbag was lying and he was never talked about like this jerk or this scumbag or this liar.  Why was he never addressed in the press?  You incestuous pigs.  Because they all do that and God help the reporter that actually jumped on him and ripped him apart because, you know, glass houses.  And they reported on it.  I mean, they didn't hide it. 
[02:18:30]  They did report it.  But why didn't they attack it the same way they attacked that?  You know what I mean?  Why is it?  He's not a jerk.  Mr. Bin Laden, Mr. Zarqawi, you know, Mr. Blair.  Jerks.  Opie and Dopey.  Jerks.  These cowards.  It's amazing where they won't take shots.  Right.  Well, let me describe this.  So it's the New York Daily News.  It's Tube Talk.  It's a huge page in the paper, like we said.  Is it really any bigger than any of the other pages in the paper, Opie?  Oh, you mean figuratively.  I thought you meant it was a huge page. 
[02:19:00]  I'm looking for this big newspaper page.  Well, I guess to explain further, it pretty much takes up the entire page.  Right.  A lot of times you have a page in the paper, but you're just part of the page.  This is pretty much the whole page.  Nice.  And there's a couple pictures.  There's Pat Battle reporting about the shark attack.  Pat Battleaxe.  With one of our pests.  She should have been reporting how her hair looks like Christian Slater while he was arrested. 
[02:19:30]  55-year-old black woman.  Would you fix that?  It's awful.  There she is at the beach in her reporting suit trying to do a serious report on a shark attack.  And there's one of our pests in the background smiling with no shirt on with an Opie Anthony XM sign.  And he made the paper now.  Yeah, it's right there.  It's immortalized in the daily news.  It's right there, man.  Make sure you get it up on the website for this fine fan.  And then above that is the one that was done, what, earlier this week?  Yes.  And with the huge Opie and Anthony cartoon sign that you've seen a bunch of times. 
[02:20:00]  With, what's her name again?  I forgot her name.  Oh, Ziggy's friend there who works with Ziggy.  Rosalyn, that's right.  Rosalyn, you can see her nose and her ears above the sign.  Top of her face peeking over.  Top of her face peeking over as this reporter is trying to do a serious report on rape.  On a rape.  And somebody was very upset that we would actually use a story about rape.  Tough shit.  To publicize our show.  Like we pick and choose what stories. 
[02:20:30]  Absolutely.  And someone actually said, it was a crime scene.  It says it in that article.  I'm sure you'll read it.  Yeah.  But it says it in there.  It was a crime scene.  No, it wasn't.  And it's the top of the stairs to a subway, which downstairs in some dark friggin' doorway, was the crime scene.  Stop it.  And if it is a crime scene, why are you trampling it all over with your reporter feet?  Your stupid reporter feet.  Right.  Stay out of the crime scene, stupid.  Yeah, because you're more important.  Camera guy is dragging his dirty work boots all over DNA evidence. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, I'm sure the cops want you in a crime scene.  Yeah.  You idiots.  It's amazing.  They don't really consider the consequences when they're reporting on a Koran being ripped up.  No one gives a shit about the consequences of that.  Right.  But God forbid, you know, you should think of the consequences when you're holding up a sign behind some self-important asshole.  You know what really upsets them?  Really upsets them.  Unlike the St. Pat's thing, that they could all jump on board and get us fired about.  There's really nothing they can do about this except be really pissed off. 
[02:21:30]  Because there's nothing wrong going on here.  There's nothing they can do.  We finally...  I think we've gotten smarter as broadcasters.  We finally figured out a way to be just extreme pests, get our names out there, and there's nothing, like you said, they can do about it.  There's nothing.  There's nothing.  This isn't illegal.  There's nothing that can stop them.  It's all fair territory behind those reporters.  Hell, man.  In that camera shot.  All these people, I'm sure even Richard Huff wrote about us when we got fired, they all had their fun. 
[02:22:00]  They all had their fun with the whole St. Pat's sex in a church thing.  They didn't care if they got their facts right.  They just needed to jump on the story and attack.  Make the story better by punching it up a little bit.  Well, now this is how we have fun.  It's how we have a little fun with you back.  Just have a little fun.  Just have a little fun.  You guys had fun with us.  We're having fun back.  Having fun.  That's all.  Do your live shots.  There's an army of dopes out there.  Moronic pests that will turn up in your camera shot. 
[02:22:30]  Just like the Iraqi army, they don't even have uniforms.  No.  Some of them are clothed in Opie and Anthony wear.  Some of them are almost naked.  Right.  Like that little fella down there.  They're wearing a mask holding Arthur Sheehan's head.  Holy crap.  Saying some kind of awful babble.  Of course.  One party rock.  Party rock.  You don't think about consequences when you report on anything. 
[02:23:00]  You never think about consequences.  But when it affects you or one of your own, all of a sudden,  how do you not think of the consequences?  Oh, this is horrible.  You shitheads.  Why don't we get Richard Huff on the phone today?  He wouldn't get on the phone.  Where's Richard Huff?  They'll never get on the phone, dude.  Why don't we get good old Richard Huff?  We'll give him a statement.  Dick, if I will.  Why didn't old Dick Huff, Dick Huff, Dick Breath, actually.  Because a Huff is a deep breath.  A Huff.  Why didn't old Dick Breath give us a call and get our whole take on the whole thing? 
[02:23:30]  Why not?  Because that would be real honest in journalism.  Why would you?  Why would you?  Just do what Jason Blair did.  Just steal some shit with AP at the end of it and write your name.  Well, guys, this is definitely worth reading.  So let me begin this, okay?  The headline, of course, jerks playing interference on live shots.  There's a saying in TV circles that the camera is a $50,000 idiot magnet.  I've never heard that in my life.  Yeah, that must be something the cameramen say.  The type of circle he stands in has a cracker in the middle of it. 
[02:24:00]  What kind of boring parties is he going to?  That's what they talk about, not look at her tits.  You know that camera?  $50,000 idiot magnet.  Idiot magnet right there.  Good point, Richard.  Good point.  Viewers got to see just what an idiot draw a TV camera is a couple of times this week when...  Oh, boy.  Psychophants?  Yeah. 
[02:24:30]  Psychophant.  That's right.  Huh?  Psychophant, I know.  Psychophants of Radio Jock's Opie and Anthony turned up in the background of live news shots, Anthony.  The incident's part of a dis...  Oh, my God.  I can't talk because I haven't eaten yet.  I'm shaking.  All right.  The incident's part of a disruption campaign launched by the XM radio host has forced local  news producers to end live shots early and take other precautions to keep the knuckleheads  off the air.  Which they have.  For example, Tuesday at noon, WABC Channel 7's Marcus Solis was ambushed while reporting 
[02:25:00]  on the rape of a woman in Hunters Point, Queens.  My God.  Oh.  He was ambushed.  He certainly was.  Not.  As Solis delivered his live introduction, a man and woman ran behind him carrying an O&A  sign while shouting their names.  But rather than deal with the jerks, Channel 7 never went back to Solis after his report.  Yeah.  It is kind of odd.  They go to these reporters now. 
[02:25:30]  The reporter does his little thing.  They go to the tape segment.  And then it always ends with them going back to the reporter who gives his little take  on the segment.  And then says, back to you in the studio.  And then they go, thank you.  And continue the news.  Whenever there's an assault, they cut it off very quickly now after the Arthur Chien thing.  They cut it off like right after he's done with his last word.  They go right to tape and never go back to the reporter again.  And I love it.  It screws up their newscast. 
[02:26:00]  Probably screws up their rhythm.  The anchors now have to handle tying the story up.  It's wonderful.  Every time they're doing a live shot, they have to be worried that some mokes with a cartoon  sign is going to run behind it and spoil the whole thing.  Asinine cartoon.  You know what's funny about that?  We were watching all the news channels this morning because that's what we do in the office  to try to get prepared for this radio program.  And every time they went live, I was getting a weird feeling like, oh God, are they striking 
[02:26:30]  behind this particular reporter?  All right, so they never went back to Solace after his report.  When will this distraction campaign stop?  Asked the reader Charles James.  A rape scene, an active crime scene.  Solace was doing his best to inform viewers of the heinous crime that took place.  How insensitive and inconsiderate of the Opie and Anthony camp.  By the way, we don't care if he leaves the XM sticker on her mouth. 
[02:27:00]  We could care less what the crime scene is, stupid.  We're here to get attention.  And by the way, I love the way he quotes a reader.  Yeah.  Quoting reader Charles.  That's news.  You asshole.  You balding asshole.  You quote reader Charles James.  What reader?  Exactly.  A reader of what?  Of what?  What was he reading?  He could have been rifling through the newest kiddie porn magazine.  And I'd certainly respect that.  That's who you quote.  I bet you he found one lousy email in his inbox about this. 
[02:27:30]  And this is what the news does.  Now they blow it out of proportion.  Like, because this guy was offended, everyone else must have been.  Right.  He didn't get much email on this, I guarantee you.  Oh, no one cares.  Charles James is a douche.  And WNBC Channel 4's Pat Battle also had an ONA disciple to send on her live report.  Is she awful?  She is horrible.  That awful pantsuit battle.  She's been around forever. 
[02:28:00]  Forever.  Well, by the way, these videos are up on opianthony.com.  Because now these videos are very famous.  They made the newspaper.  And WNBC's Channel 4's Pat Battle also had an ONA disciple to send on her live report on a shark attack from the Jersey Shore, Anthony.  We prepare our staffers, our journalists, to handle these types of situations professionally, said a Channel 4 spokeswoman.  Not like Channel 2.  We have procedures in place to protect the integrity of our broadcasts, a Channel 2 spokeswoman said. 
[02:28:30]  Our news department is comprised of veteran reporters who should know how to handle these situations.  He only goes to them.  You're right.  No calls to you guys, what is it you're trying to accomplish, why don't you stop doing it?  Not one call to you guys, only to the one-sided story.  Of course it is.  Yeah.  They tried to talk to Wayne Williams when he was accused of murdering children in Atlanta.  They camped outside to get his opinion.  To get his opinion, because maybe a couple of people might read and go, all right, I see his point. 
[02:29:00]  I understand this man.  They were alleging that he was sexually abusing and murdering black children in Atlanta, and they wanted to hear what he had to say.  Right.  And then two shock jerks.  Shock jerks.  They decide not to call and just do the story without you.  The media is just repugnant.  We're available.  Where was he?  Where was the phone call?  How did I just compare you to Wayne Williams?  I know.  That wasn't exactly the intention.  Yeah, I didn't really like that.  But I didn't mean it.  I didn't mind it.  He got a lot more done, by the way.  Jesus.  Let's go to Daryl in Michigan.  Daryl.  Hey, how are you guys doing? 
[02:29:30]  Good.  Great show.  Thanks.  Thank you, sir.  I just wanted to remind you real quick, you forgot to mention rocket scientists.  Oh, did you think we weren't called rocket scientists or genius in this article?  Yeah, that's your other popular, you get morons and jerks.  I tend to think, and I don't like this, but I tend to think, I think they might be being sarcastic  when they say rocket scientist or genius in some of the articles.  I don't know.  I consider myself well-educated, but I don't think I'm a genius. 
[02:30:00]  It might be sarcastic.  I attempted to be a rocket scientist, actually.  Yeah.  But I couldn't get past physics 101 and said, ah, I guess it's not for me.  Is that it?  Screw the rocket science.  Right.  Leave it to someone else.  I'll go into broadcasting.  The OPN Anthony Show.  Ah, Daily News, Richard Huff, part two.  Yes.  And by the end of this, we're all getting along and we're happy.  It's the worst of OPN Anthony.  Let's say hi to Richard Huff from the Daily News.  Mr. Huff?  Yeah.  How are you, buddy?  Good, thanks. 
[02:30:30]  It's Opie, it's Anthony, and it's Jim Norton.  Hey, guys.  First of all, I want to thank you for the major exposure today.  Even though you didn't want to do it, we read the article, and I see there's one part  where you say, you know, I know what this is going to do, and it's doing exactly what  they want, giving them exposure.  That is indeed what we're doing this for, is to get exposure for the show, get the name  out there, and it does seem to be working.  You've got to agree with that.  Hey, I'm here for you.  Can I ask you a question?  It just seems that the media, the way that you guys have covered this one, it seems like 
[02:31:00]  there's a real personal anger over the fact that Arthur Cheyenne, who obviously is a  media person, was victimized, or it seems like we get a lot from the media, you guys  caused him to be fired.  It seems like that's the general consensus from the media.  Oh, no, I wouldn't say that, at least from my aspect here.  Look, he did something he shouldn't have done on the air.  There's no doubt about that.  I think what you're seeing from some extent, and I can see it from some of the letters  I've gotten since he got canned, is that people think maybe the penalty on CBS's part 
[02:31:30]  might have been a little too bad.  Yeah, we even agree with that.  That's ridiculous.  You know, the guy lost it, but to be fired now because of this zero tolerance policy that's  out there is ridiculous.  Well, and so I think that's where some of the anger is.  Look, I'm not sitting here to defend him dropping the F-bomb like that.  I mean, that was just wrong, and he didn't deal with it appropriately.  So, no, I'm not angry about that.  Now, let's dispose of the love fest here. 
[02:32:00]  Obviously, you have a problem with what we're doing.  Well, you know what it is?  It's like, imagine you're sitting at your desk, and somebody walks up behind you and  starts making faces or doing something, and you can't do anything about it.  I don't agree with that, though.  We've heard that example being used before.  And if you put your desk out on the street and decided to now work out in the public and  somebody did that, you would have to expect it and deal with it professionally.  That's what these reporters are doing.  They're taking their job out on the public streets where behind them is fair game, and 
[02:32:30]  it has been for years.  People have just randomly dropped by, made faces, shout-outs.  I've seen gang signs thrown up when they do stories from Compton and whatnot.  And this, we figured, is a great area for an Opie and Anthony billboard, if you will,  a sign to pop up behind us.  We've asked people not to interfere with the reporter or touch the reporter in any way.  But to have that opening there in public territory, I see no problem with it. 
[02:33:00]  And I can't see how people get upset with it when, you know, they're opening that up to us.  Well, I mean, you do have a point there.  There's no doubt about it.  Now, in many of these cases, though, they do go out of their way to make sure there's  not something behind them.  I mean, Pat Battle was standing on a beach with nothing behind her on an empty beach,  and your guy comes running up.  You know what, Richard?  You've got to admit, did you see the video?  I did.  You've got to admit, it's kind of funny when you see the guy starting to run from behind 
[02:33:30]  her way in the distance and getting closer and closer.  Or look at the one with Marcus Solis.  You had these two folks come up out of the subway.  Yeah, they're coming out like troll people out of the ground.  And you are right in the fact that, I mean, how many times have you watched a newscast  and there's some goofball in the back on a cell phone waving, trying to, you know, get  his girlfriend on the line before the...  Yeah, we've just taken that to the next level.  That's all.  But, Richard, the question I have, like, this is one of the problems I have.  Not that you guys shouldn't cover it or talk about it or even editorialize on it. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, my God, cover it all you want.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  You got exactly what you wanted.  But the attitude coming from the media about it is a bit self-righteous.  When you look at it, you say, like, how would you feel if you were doing your job and were  interfered with it?  Well, how many people are doing their job and are interfered with by the press trying  to grab a story?  And I'm not talking about legitimate interference.  How many times have there been crime victims where reporters are sticking their microphone  in the face just to get the scoop?  It's like reporters can be pretty...  Intrusive.  Yeah.  And pretty vulture-ish when it comes to getting stories. 
[02:34:30]  And yet here we are doing our jobs trying to get press and doing this.  And we're being vilified in a weird way, like being called jerks, which is fine.  I mean, you know, we are jerks.  I didn't call you jerks.  I called the people who are doing it jerks.  But I'm going to say, even the New York Times said opium and dopey.  There are jerks, Richard.  We are, too.  But it's like, even the New York Times said opium and dopey.  And yet when they talk about Al-Zarqawi or Bin Laden, it's Mr. Bin Laden or Mr.  Why is this...  Why is it that people feel free to editorialize here and not on real things?  Like on Jason Blair, were people calling him liar or scumbag when they were writing about him? 
[02:35:00]  Or were they just calling him disgraced reporter?  Well, I think it depends on the publication you're working with, too.  I mean, you know, look, the Times is not going to take that kind of attitude with anything they write.  They did.  No, what I'm saying is, you know, generally speaking, I write a column.  I mean, you're reading a column that's opinion.  Right.  But, you know, in the same section, we have regular, straight, hopefully, objective stories.  You know, I'm not sure about the story that you're talking about, the one in the Times.  I didn't see that one. 
[02:35:30]  I know there was a column or something that they wrote.  I'm not going to defend them.  You know, you're right.  There are some aspects of the media where it is intrusive and it does become a problem.  Yeah, I don't have much respect for what these guys do, to be honest with you.  What guys?  Ah, the reporters, you know, the fear-mongering they love to do.  I don't have much respect for their jobs.  Well, you know what?  I mean, it's not all that.  It's become a lot more entertainment-based than it has actually giving you the proper and accurate information. 
[02:36:00]  When I watch the news, what I see is an entertainment show.  I see them battling each other for viewers and using, you know, clever graphics, teasers, even live locations.  They promote where they're going to be, bands that they're getting on these morning shows.  It's all entertainment-based now.  And to have this attitude where we can do this, but the second we're interfered with, now you're interfering with our journalism, you know, and our credibility as journalists. 
[02:36:30]  I don't buy it.  Well, you guys are old enough to remember the times where we were all sitting around saying, oh, this is the MTV-ization of the media.  I mean, you've seen that go even further now with everything else out there.  I mean, look, lots of folks tuned to Entertainment Tonight for their news.  Yeah.  And that's what a lot of people are competing with.  Look at what's going on with the CBS Evening News.  They've talked about multiple anchors and different approaches.  Do you think people would watch a news program like it was when it was a desk, a guy, and a clock, and a microphone, you know? 
[02:37:00]  Like in the older days where you knew you were pretty much getting accurate information.  It wasn't about flash and teases and entertainment.  It was just about news.  Do you think people would watch that?  You know, that's a good question.  Again, it becomes an age issue here because there's a sense that the younger folks aren't watching it that way.  They're getting their news on the Internet. 
[02:37:30]  They're scanning the headlines.  I mean, it's hard these days not to get your news in some fashion.  You know, you turn your computer on, your homepage already tells you who won the game, even if you didn't know.  Right.  So that's what these folks are facing.  A straight-ahead newscast like we used to have, low graphics, just a guy sitting in a suit, probably not.  Probably not.  It's like you watch Network with Peter Finch.  It was almost prophetic of the way things are being done now to get viewers.  It's going farther and farther.  And again, we understand that. 
[02:38:00]  But it's like they do.  The media does at times take a holier-than-thou attitude when it is about getting viewers.  It is about competing with the other networks, just like any other entertainment venue.  But that doesn't diminish what you hope is the quality of the journalism.  The things they do to get you to the show may be a little different these days.  And, you know, you mentioned the concerts.  Obviously, over a two-hour or three-hour morning breakfast show, you can have those sorts of elements. 
[02:38:30]  You have a half-hour evening newscast.  You're not going to have a concert.  Well, Richard, are you sure that it doesn't compromise the integrity, though?  When you're rushing to get the story first, maybe you don't fact-check as much.  Maybe you're not as concerned with getting it right as opposed to getting it first.  I think that does kind of interfere with, like, what's being reported accurately.  Well, you know, that's an issue.  There's no doubt about it.  You know, and you're seeing more situations now where folks are taking the easy way out  and just copying somebody else's column, which is amazing in this electronic era. 
[02:39:00]  I mean, turn on the computer any day, and you'll see another story of a journalist in Podunk.  Who, you know, copied something from somebody else.  I mean, it's just ridiculous.  But I think, you know, a majority of the journalists hopefully get the story correct.  You're going to make mistakes.  There are days where, you know, you don't make the extra call.  Or you do, and you get the wrong information.  Well, obviously, we're doing this, this assault on the media, to get attention, to get the name out there. 
[02:39:30]  But the little side thing that I think we're enjoying also is giving it back to the media a little bit.  And, you know, saying, hey, you guys are taking yourself pretty seriously.  And we think that's a little hypocritical.  And, yeah, here we are, right behind you.  In your column, you mentioned Stern fans calling shows.  And, again, my comments on that, I actually thought those calls were really funny.  So I'm not judging those callers because they made me laugh.  But you make it look like those were kind of smarter things to do. 
[02:40:00]  And I point out the 93 Trade Center bombing, the Colin Ferguson massacre, Oklahoma City bombing.  These are all shows that they called on.  I think it was the LL or whatever it was, whatever the aerial shooting was in L.A.  Right.  I mean, you name it.  Now, to that point, and obviously that was just one paragraph in this whole thing,  is that, you know, in that sense, the idea there was it coming to what you said a minute ago about not checking something.  I mean, that shows how easy it is for folks to just get on. 
[02:40:30]  The difference here is you're disrupting somebody doing what they're doing.  And that is, too.  Yeah, that's what Howard Stern fans have been doing as well.  You know, they're not trying to make a point whatsoever.  I don't think their motivation is really to expose the news for, you know, not checking facts.  I think you know that.  They're not trying to expose the news.  They are allowed on.  And by proxy of being allowed on, they are exposing the news just by the fact that they got through.  But their goal is to get a laugh and to get Howard's name out there.  And I don't mind you mentioning that because I thought those calls were funny.  But to use it kind of and say, well, these guys are right, and this is Opie and Anthony. 
[02:41:00]  The fans are naughty.  It's kind of like, I don't know, I just felt it was a bit disingenuous.  Naughty.  Watch the language.  I know.  I didn't mean to get too slow.  We can swear here, can't we?  No, you know what I'm saying, though.  I felt it was a bad comparison to make to say that these were right.  I don't feel it's accurate.  I mean, how can you say that that's accurate when those examples are raised?  Nope.  But we disagree.  And who is Charles James?  Right.  Reader Charles James.  Reader Charles James.  Where did you get that quote from, Richard?  Come on.  Who is he?  We make that up.  We've got a whole style here. 
[02:41:30]  Do you really think Howard's fans were doing that just to make a mockery of the media?  Do you really think they were doing that to make a social point?  I think that is, in fact, the point.  Clearly now there are people who just want to be like him, who do it just to do it.  But I believe that they initially started that way.  So why would they yell his name instead of doing something else that was socially relevant if it wasn't to get his name out there?  Well, because then it doesn't get mentioned. 
[02:42:00]  I want to be liked by Howard, so I'm going to mention his name, just like your folks mention your names.  Right.  So why are you painting it in a different light like it was done to expose the media and make a social point?  It's almost like you're giving it a certain legitimacy.  Credibility, right.  A credibility that you won't give this.  And again, I think those calls are very funny, so I'm not judging them on a certain level.  I think it's an equal base.  I think we're doing exactly the same thing.  It's trying to get the name out there.  Of course.  And using the media to do it.  And I don't see any difference between that. 
[02:42:30]  And what's more interfering with a job, actually interrupting a newscast under a false pretense and getting airtime or just holding up a dumb sign?  I mean, what is really costing more airtime?  Well, I mean, you're doing the same, aren't you?  I mean, when folks can't come back to a live shot because your people are standing behind them.  That's funny.  Hey, you know something?  They could come back.  Sure they can.  That sign will be back there, but the report is not going to be interfered with.  If they're a professional, they can plow through it and finish their story.  Absolutely.  But if you have a phony fire chief, Shelly Howard Stern, you can't get the real Howard chief on there. 
[02:43:00]  The phony fire chief.  Or the real fire chief.  Right, exactly.  Yeah, no, that's true.  Now, what happened to your guy at the beach?  He wasn't there when she came back.  He wasn't our guy.  He was just some fan.  Yeah, listen.  And by the way, Richard, our fans are pests, and we don't like them either.  And we think they're jerks.  They're very bad people.  But they're very loyal, and they'll do anything for us.  Yeah, you just made this situation a lot worse.  Yeah.  A lot worse.  You called them weasels in your article.  They're pests. 
[02:43:30]  Weasels.  Hey, Richard, why didn't you call us?  We would have gave you a few quotes.  I didn't know where to get you.  Oh, really?  We're well hidden.  But you understand what I'm saying?  It's like whenever...  I raised this example this morning.  When Wayne Williams was being accused of murdering children, they couldn't wait to hear what he said.  And yet, in this case, nobody wants to call and find out what our side of the story is,  or what the show's side of the story is.  And I just can't quite get that.  That's usually the way.  Whenever a story wraps itself around this program, we rarely get calls to get our side of it.  It's usually a lot easier to just throw the story together with speculation and punch the story up a little bit. 
[02:44:00]  Well, look, I think, you know, and you guys have dealt with David Hinckley, our radio reporter, before.  We do reach out in those situations.  I mean, this is a column talking about what people are seeing on TV, you know, in my opinion.  So I don't, you know, I don't...  What would you have added to it?  Which, you know, I don't...  I guess I'll do it.  I like tube talk, by the way.  I think you do a good job with it.  I really do.  Richard Huff.  And by the way, I'm getting a lot of letters from folks who agree with you. 
[02:44:30]  Uh-oh.  Yes, they're out there.  Oh, yeah.  Once again, the pests.  Were they calling you Dick Huff?  That hasn't happened yet, but I'm sure now that you're mentioning it...  Well, we called him Dick Breath.  Yeah, we kind of...  We were a little angry this morning.  We were cranky this morning.  We might have called you Dick Huff and Dick Breath or something equally as offensive.  You know, you seem like a pretty cool guy, and it's nice to have a guy that actually  does, you know, come on the air with us. 
[02:45:00]  At least you came on the air.  Yeah, most people just run away and hide behind their article.  There was a huge AP story about us that...  Oh, about the Arthur Cheehan.  And the AP writer said that we were celebrating the fact that he got fired.  Yeah, it said, right now, Opie and Anthony are celebrating his firing.  And I was in Colorado at the time, and I was playing golf.  And I was in Florida at a graduation.  And I'm like, I'm celebrating this guy's firing?  Where did this guy get this information?  How does he print this when I didn't even speak to this guy?  Right.  Unbelievable.  If you want to talk, you should go over some articles. 
[02:45:30]  Read that Times article and watch how incestuous a lot of the reporting is.  And it's very subtle, but people in the media are very angry that one of their own got caught  out there.  And you don't see this kind of defensive reporting or these type of defensive phrasing using a  lot of cases.  But they're really getting very defensive and upset because one of their own was fired.  Yeah.  Again, as we started here, I mean, I think that he just messed up there.  That was, you know, not handling the situation.  And it's interesting if you look at the comment from Channel 2 in that piece I wrote today. 
[02:46:00]  You know, our reporters are professionally trained in this sort of stuff, except the  one we got rid of.  Except the one we fired.  But it is interesting the response that has come back just on Arthur's, you know, firing  from folks throughout the city concerned about that.  Well, we agree that he shouldn't have been fired.  We thought what he did was, you know, a little dumb and he should have thought more.  But they never should have fired him for it.  But just the way they were, like the Times said, Arthur Cheyenne acted human.  And they're all saying he was so provoked, which is true.  But you don't see them ever reporting other things that way. 
[02:46:30]  Why is the tone so defensive?  Because it's one of their own.  Good question.  I wish I had an answer for you.  All right.  Richard, before we let you go, the one TV show we all should be watching.  Oh, good question.  We like that Hit Me Baby One More Time show that's on Thursday nights on NBC.  You know, lots of talk about that one.  It's amazing how well the dancing show is doing.  All right.  Yeah, that goddamn dancing show.  It's like, is it just, is it ballroom or all kinds of dancing? 
[02:47:00]  It's ballroom.  It's ballroom dancing with celebrities doing it.  What?  They got, like, the guy that played Peterman from Seinfeld.  Yeah, he's in it.  Evander Holyfield.  Evander Holyfield.  Joey McIntyre.  Heather Mills.  No.  Hey, Richard Laff.  Oh, damn.  Jimmy.  Richard Laff.  Watch Rescue Me when that comes back.  Yeah, well, that had a great first season.  Yeah, with Dennis Leary.  Yeah, a couple weeks.  Wait, wait, what's this dancing show, though?  So then what happens?  They dance.  It's almost like an American Idol of dancing with celebrities. 
[02:47:30]  Exactly.  They got the three, you know, American Idol wannabe judges with all the stereotypical characters we have now for judges.  And they dance.  And then, you know, the judges vote and the viewers vote, which is pretty amazing.  Because in the first episode, Kelly Monaco, who's on one of the soaps, was terrible.  I mean, terrible.  Yeah.  Like me ballroom dancing.  And they got the lowest marks.  And then they voted Trista Rain off, or Trista Sutter now, you know, who's on The Bachelorette. 
[02:48:00]  So that's kind of a fun show for goofy reasons.  Hit me, baby, one more time.  Lots of folks are talking about this.  Yeah, nostalgia is so in, you know.  It's like anything 80s is really huge.  Yeah, but I don't think it's nostalgia in the sense of appreciating this.  I think it's a lot.  No, it's making fun of it.  You know, a lot of those shows, like We Love the 80s and things like that, it's about making fun of it and going, ew.  You know, I kind of remember that, and it was awful then.  Yeah, exactly.  Why do people like looking back at things that were awful? 
[02:48:30]  Well, you know, it's looking back and saying, wow, look at how fat that guy got.  You know, I mean, that's what half of the audience.  That's what we've been doing.  Making yourself feel better.  Just knocking other people down.  Yeah, perfect.  We like to call it time is a bitch, Richard.  Yeah.  We play the original version of the song and then how they, you know, sang it last night, and it's very interesting, the contrast.  Yeah, oh, no doubt about it.  No doubt about it.  But that's doing pretty well.  Well, Richard, I've got to thank you for coming on the show.  That's pretty cool.  Anytime.  And thank you for exposing this to a lot more people for us. 
[02:49:00]  You see, you didn't even have to buy an ad.  Yeah, you could do a follow-up and say you spoke to us and we said this will continue.  Thanks very much.  Thanks, Richard.  Take care, guys.  See you.  Bye.  Richard Huff from the Daily News.  Look at that.  At least he came on the air, man.  Most of these reporters never would, but he was fine with it.  Isn't it amazing how people go from hated douchebag in the morning  and then a couple hours later, he's a cool guy.  I never really hated him.  He played right into our hands, and I was happy about that. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, but I'll bet he's going, all right, I thought those guys were going to be complete scumbags.  He's like, how hard it is not to be a scumbag just so they can't say that we would be complete scumbags  and they expected that.  We love throwing people off.  I know.  But he was honest.  I mean, he didn't.  He bullshitted.  I just, you know, I don't feel bad about what I said this morning.  I was very upset.  Mm-hmm.  A little less.  Not happy.  Didn't have your coffee yet.  Good point, Ant.  A little cranky.  Hey, this is Chris Angel.  You're listening to The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  XM 202, The Opie and Anthony Show.  Voss, eBay, car, part three. 
[02:50:00]  All the things you didn't learn in part one and part two of Voss, eBay, car.  Hit it.  Hit it now, part three.  The Heretic.  It's The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Did we talk more about the Rolls-Royce on eBay and all that?  No, I want to get to the bottom.  Because Bonnie's here, too.  We could get her perspective on this.  Otto, have you heard about this?  You bought...  He tried to buy a Rolls-Royce on eBay.  What year?  It was a 98.  A 98 Rolls.  I can't understand wanting to drive a Rolls, though. 
[02:50:30]  No, it wasn't a 98.  You've got to be driven around in a Rolls, though.  Yeah, sure.  You can't drive your own Rolls.  Yeah.  He said he was going to get Patrice to drive him around.  I don't think so.  All his fantasy was, was he just kept having this fantasy of pulling up.  I don't even know where, and all his friends would be.  Pulling up in a Rolls, right.  And your friends are saying, yeah.  What are you, Arthur?  Yeah, like, moving on up.  You're going to drive into the neighborhood in your Rolls-Royce.  Once around the park, Bitterman.  Just stand next to...  Where's the rest of that moose? 
[02:51:00]  Just stand next to the car, waiting for people to notice.  I fell out of the car.  Is that the funniest thing you've ever seen?  Perfect, Peter Lorre.  You stop.  This was a good-looking car.  If you go to eBay...  On the Internet, it was stopped.  Yeah, because...  And what happened?  In real life, it didn't look good.  It broke down on the test drive.  We were in the car with her.  Were you there?  Yeah.  Bonnie was there.  On the test drive.  I got in, and it smelled like mildew, and I said to the guy, oh, it's got a funky smell. 
[02:51:30]  And he goes, oh, you know what that is?  He had some, like, you know...  Ukrainian act.  Yeah.  That is a sauerkraut in the trunk.  And he pulled over, and sure enough, he had, like, this huge box of sauerkraut in the trunk.  And he puts it in the trunk for a reason.  Yeah, he put it in case they ask, I'm going to have a...  Because the thing stinks.  Yeah.  And he's able to say now, because the sauerkraut's in the trunk.  Why the fuck do you have a sauerkraut?  Like, the car went off a pier at some point.  Yeah, that's probably what happened.  And it got flooded.  Got soaked somehow.  Fell into a lake.  And then he had cabasso, or whatever... 
[02:52:00]  What's it called?  Cabasso?  Cabasso.  Cabasso.  Cabasso.  I don't know what you're called.  Famous sumo wrestler, cabasso.  I got to say sausage.  Say Polish sausage.  Yeah.  Wow.  How does that work?  Do you meet him, like, under a bridge with the car?  I mean, does he bring it to you, or...?  Well, no.  I was in his house.  I know.  I was working in Florida.  It was a car dealer shooting a gun.  He knows this guy.  I know.  This is my guy.  I was just looking on eBay cars, and this one so happened to be in Fort Lauderdale, where 
[02:52:30]  I was going the next week.  Right.  So, on eBay, it really looked clean.  There's a link somewhere.  Someone has it on.  So, it looked nice on eBay.  Shiny.  Didn't look dented.  Beautiful.  Not dented.  It looked like a nice...  Have you seen it?  I saw the picture.  Yeah.  It's not a bad-looking car.  I mean, if you had that car, you know, a little status.  A status.  You know what Keith Robinson said?  He goes, does it come with a Tommy gun?  Tommy gun.  Right on the...  Bonnie and Voss.  Right on the running boards of Bonnie and Voss. 
[02:53:00]  That's hilarious.  It smelled like kielbosco.  Right.  What the hell is kielbosco?  Whatever.  I don't eat red meat.  Oh, my God.  It's not red meat, really.  Oh, brother.  It's everything but the red meat.  So, now you saw it and figured you're going down there, but, my God, this is such a good  deal that someone's going to scoop it up before I get there, so I better put a deposit  on.  Yes, because here's what it was.  And can I just say this?  I said to him, don't do it, many times. 
[02:53:30]  This is the first time I'm saying I told you so.  Ah, good.  But it was really, yeah, it was irritating.  Well, I'm just trying to say, get used to that feeling of irritation.  This is coming your way when you say, I do.  I do.  I'm irritated.  I'm just trying to get a second car for you.  This wasn't really for me.  And then he kept trying to say it was for me, this whole thing that he was doing.  Don't do me any favors.  Yeah.  Here's the thing.  You see, I see it on the internet, and I'm looking at it.  It was like 26, right?  26 large. 
[02:54:00]  26, you know.  So, everything's excellent.  I go to, it says everything's, then I go to, like, you know, not a blue book, you know,  whatever, because they didn't have a blue book for that year, that low.  So, but it said 44,000.  Oh, well.  Or 50,000 in main condition.  You're ahead of the game right from the start.  I'm saying, I'm going to take it home, drive it a couple months, and sell it.  Make like 15 grand.  Turn it over.  Turn it over, but I'd never done that before, so I, you know, it could have been a, it could  have backfired.  Of course.  When he was trying to get the deposit back, he kept saying to the guy on the phone, 
[02:54:30]  but I wanted to make money off of this car.  Oh, God.  That's his excuse.  That's an excuse?  That was, like, why he should get his money off.  And the guy's like, yeah, I did the same thing, and I made a grand already.  Yeah.  But don't make it, don't make it sound like, oh, he got it from eBay.  eBay is nothing but classifieds on, on, on the computer.  That's all right.  Except you don't want a thousand dollars down.  Well, yeah, I bought clothes off eBay, some good stuff.  You bought clothes?  Why are you buying clothes off eBay? 
[02:55:00]  Wait, wait, how about just boughten?  Boughten.  Boughten?  Yeah.  I bought, oh, I bought clothes off of eBay.  Whatever, okay, past 10.  Okay.  Pass that.  Here's the thing.  You can get deals, like, I've gotten, like, Prada pants for, like, you know, 70 bucks or whatever for Prada.  Were they used?  Used.  No, brand new with the tags and everything.  How do you know they're not counterfeit?  Come on.  Well, people aren't counterfeiting designer everything. 
[02:55:30]  Well, that's true.  But here's the thing.  There's certain ways to tell.  Like, the buttons.  Oh, that's rough.  Why would someone be selling them cheap?  How would they legitimately be selling it cheap?  Because I bought golf clubs.  I bought golf clubs because they don't, a golf shop is paying high rent overhead, and these  places sell them out of a warehouse, out of a warehouse where they just have boxes of  it, so there's no overhead.  That's cutting out the middleman.  Okay, that's right.  You explained it to me already.  Okay, I heard that. 
[02:56:00]  You knew the cutting out the middleman thing there, Bonnie.  Okay.  You know, you've got to know how to get deals, all right?  You go to AA meetings, you find guys whose marriages aren't working, or you get a ring.  Things happen.  You've got to know how to make them happen.  Get a bargain, right.  So, the roles is on there.  You see it.  It looks good online.  So, you call the guy up, and you say, I'm interested in the car.  I'm going to be coming down there to take a look at it.  And what does he say, well, there's another guy, there's another comic that's working 
[02:56:30]  down here, and he's already, he's ready to buy it.  That old gag.  You're right.  I love The Wizard of Oz.  I'll buy anything that has to do with that movie, and this guy on eBay was selling the  ruby slippers, and I bought him.  It was Jack Ruby Slippers.  I like that one, Otto.  George, did you like all those jokes?  Yeah, it was about as funny as a cry for help.  Fucking stink on hot ice. 
[02:57:00]  All right, it was a mistake.  So, you call him up.  I call the guy up, and I say, you know, I'm interested in the car.  He goes, well, you've got to leave a deposit, you know, because it's...  Use his accent.  I don't do accents.  And Joe Cotty doesn't do sit-ups.  So, he wanted a deposit.  Even though you're coming down, how long between the time you talked to him on the phone until  you were going to be down there looking at the car? 
[02:57:30]  Two days.  Two days.  So, for two days, this guy wanted a grand to hold this car for you.  That's when I should have known something.  That's when you should have known something.  And I'm a street guy.  I know kind of scams.  You run into gunfire.  I know.  You're a street guy.  I know.  I just...  I wish...  What?  Well, he gets taken in by a salesman all the time.  Oh, no.  You're that guy?  Yeah.  We were in this Weiland gallery.  You know, the guy who does those dumb fish paintings.  Around the country, on the walls.  Yeah, he does them on the walls. 
[02:58:00]  He'll basically just put his, like a fish drawing on anything in his name and try to sell it.  So, we go into one of these galleries and next thing you know, it's like hours of them  putting stuff on the walls, turning the lights down so we can see it better.  I have no patience for any of that.  Rich just keeps going.  He just keeps going.  And, you know, can you send it to me?  And how is this going to click?  Oh, wrap that up, please.  I'll take two of these.  Oh, great.  I'm going to ship that to my palatial condo. 
[02:58:30]  They hated me because I was like, get out of this store.  Well, you're not social.  You're antisocial.  You don't like people.  You don't fucking, you know, I like to talk and get a little knowledge.  You're a people person.  Well, I'm getting a little knowledge out there.  Wow.  The guy's a hack.  The guy's a hack painter.  You're talking to mongoloids?  Did the fish paintings smell like sauerkraut?  I don't know.  What's that smell?  Good.  You're one of those guys.  What about on the phone? 
[02:59:00]  Is he always on the phone when they call up with the telemarketers or you try to conduct  business and they always try to rope you into something else?  Not those people I don't have patience for.  I can't.  On the phone, I'm brutal on the phone.  In real life, face to face, I'm pretty bad because I will sit there and listen to somebody's  stupid pitch and want to smack him in the head.  I'm not too much of a pussy to say anything.  On the phone, last night, one of the fans went out on my computer.  So I had to call up Dell and it was a big pain in the ass to try to get an actual person  on the phone.  So I get the person and I want to order a new fan.  So I say, I need a fan for this computer. 
[02:59:30]  And it turns into a whole thing.  Have you heard about Dell's new incentive plan on?  And I just went, no, I want no incentive plan.  I want this fan.  I want it sent to me next day.  That's it.  That's all I'm calling you for is this fan.  Okay, please hold.  I hold.  He goes, okay, we put that order in.  Do you know Dell's preferred customer service will get you?  And like he's got a script that he's got to read to everybody.  And I just lost.  I'm like, I just want the fan.  Don't mention another thing.  Don't.  Over the phone, I'm brutal. 
[03:00:00]  But in real life, I'm like, oh, yeah, please tell me about this.  I'm looking at my watch, kicking myself because I'm a faggot.  That guy's probably in India, too.  He was in India.  He had a slight Indian accent.  They're all in India now.  Yeah, they get taught to have a Texas accent.  They take classes and stuff.  Yeah, which I think is racist.  We can't just do their accent.  They want, when do you want to fan my friend?  We'll show you one.  So they've got to make it sound more American.  Yeah.  So we accept them.  So that we think that they're good.  Yeah, that we're going to get what we need.  Because I would be, oh, great. 
[03:00:30]  If I heard this guy, okay, your order is complete.  It's going to be sent to you.  I would hang up thinking, great.  I'm going to get like a mouse sent to me or something.  A real one, not even a computer one.  So to finish this up, how did you get your money back in the end?  He put it back in.  Because I was on the radio down there, and I was trashing him and trashing the car.  Did he say his name or anything?  No, but I think he might have heard me.  And he knew that I was an entertainer.  And I could have, you know.  Oh, yeah.  He gave me his business card.  He could have blown up his spot.  God forbid.  No, he gave me.  What happens is he gave me his business card.  I mean, his credibility, 30 people at a time. 
[03:01:00]  I've seen the lines outside when you're giving a free shit away.  Okay?  Jesus Christ.  There's three fat people in a stripper that won't get undressed.  When he's right, he's right.  Sure.  But he gave me his business card with his address and everything.  That's where he went wrong.  That's where he went wrong.  You know, because now I got his, you know, whatever.  Now you got his address?  And this and that.  And plus, also. 
[03:01:30]  Know where you live.  I'll call the state's attorney.  You can't keep somebody's deposit.  That's what I heard.  Squirt some sauerkraut in the welcome mat.  Get back at him.  That was a mistake.  I lived and learned.  All right.  We should take a break.  I don't believe you're gullible, though.  You just want a car.  And you hope that there's a deal somewhere, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  See, you know what I'm saying.  Maybe try it again.  Look for another role.  I'm looking at a BMW on there.  A Bima.  Oh, look at you.  Let's see what happens with that.  Good luck to you.  Good luck to you. 
[03:02:00]  Exactly.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Why are you shaking your head, Eric?  These are just intros.  Don't worry about it.  They don't have to be spectacular.  They just have to intro the goddamn bit.  The funny is in the actual bit.  Who's shaking his head?  Eric.  Eric's shaking his head.  He didn't like the last intro we did.  He thinks we're a little lackluster today.  Maybe Eric should do the next intro.  Yeah, go ahead, Eric.  Let's see what you got.  What's the next one?  Let it rip.  Robert Kelly Breaks His Knee remixes.  So far, so good.  Continue. 
[03:02:30]  The listeners have begun to send in their remixes.  Asshole.  Continue.  They've been sending in their remixes using the audio from Bob Breakin' His Knee.  Most of them are terrible, except the last one, which is a Reservoir Dogs record.  Hello, exactly.  So basically, you're telling people not to listen to this next segment, because most  of the remixes are awful, except for one lousy one that's going to last maybe 30 seconds  at the end of this 30-minute bit, right?  But the commentary is genius.  It's the worst of the enemy.  Bob Kelly's a good friend of Jim Norton's, and a good friend of ours. 
[03:03:00]  Does some good radio for us, and he was on tour with Dane Cook as part of that tour-gasm.  There's going to be a DVD out eventually of the whole tour, and basically broke his knee  playing football.  That's the whole story.  He's kind of out of shape.  Bob is a chubby fellow with a goatee, and he jumped up to try to be an athlete and a  man for once, and he clumsily came down on his fucking, obviously, easily shatterable  little legs, supporting all that weight they hadn't strengthened, and he hurt himself. 
[03:03:30]  Yes.  And he broke his leg, man.  Yes.  Broke his leg, man.  Dude.  Dude, man.  I couldn't tell for the first 20 minutes of that audio what was wrong with him, though.  I could sense something was messed up, but I wasn't too sure what it was.  And the best part of the audio is when he asks for someone to hold his hand.  It's just disturbing.  And, well, the audio's up on opiananthony.com.  I don't think we need to play the audio at this point, right?  Mm-mm.  No?  Okay.  Sad.  Well, people have taken the audio, and they have already started making remixes.  A fun little feature on the opiananthony show where you guys get to have fun with some 
[03:04:00]  of the audio, classic audio that we have on the show, and making it to something else.  God, you're making me jealous.  I'm so hungry right now.  What do you mean, man?  I am done.  Tuna.  Time.  And Dave Muir, we're going to get to you next.  We're going to get to you next.  All right?  He's falling asleep on us.  Uh-oh.  Stay happy.  Handsome.  All right, we're going to get to him in a few seconds here.  But they're coming in.  And so I haven't even heard any of these, Anthony.  None of us have, except for Steve.  Steve usually tries to give us the more interesting ones.  So we'll start with this one from Roman War Helmet from whackbag.com. 
[03:04:30]  It's Beavis and Butthead and Bob Kelly.  Mm-hmm.  Bouncing up.  Jim.  He's down.  You're way down.  He's down.  I snapped my knee, man. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, no.  I broke my knee, man.  Fuck.  9-1-1, dude.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my fucking knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  Hey, how's it going?  I broke my fucking knee, dude.  I heard it break, dude.  Really?  Fuck.  God.  I broke my knee, dude.  You dumbass.  Just leave this one flat.  Can we get up some water?  Can we get up some water?  I've got to squeeze something. 
[03:05:30]  Ah, don't touch me, asswipe.  Let go, Barber.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah, fuck.  What a dork.  Oh, fuck.  What a dork.  I broke my fucking knee, man.  Oh, man.  It bent backwards.  God damn, man. 
[03:06:00]  We get somebody coming off.  He said, calm.  You gotta be fucking kidding me, dude.  Uh.  Uh.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  You can't see enough of this crap.  That was cool.  No, it wasn't.  Uh.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's not bad.  Roman Warhelman from whackbag.com. 
[03:06:30]  Love the Beavis and Bugs.  It was a damn funny show.  It certainly was.  Moral decay, though.  Good point, JJ.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll do one more before we go to break here.  This is from Scott from Cleveland, Anthony.  Hmm.  I haven't heard any of these.  Bill's dead.  Uh-oh.  The Bill's dead lady and Bob Kelly.  Uh-oh.  This could be good.  It has potential, right?  I always like the old lady being thrown in, but it's got to work.  All right.  Well, if it sucks, just tell, you know, let's, uh, we'll stop it and read, uh, make fun of 
[03:07:00]  it here.  Hi.  I broke my knee, dude.  What's up?  I broke my fucking knee, dude.  I heard it break, dude.  Oh, no.  I heard my knee break, dude.  Who is this?  I'm in so much pain, man.  Who is this?  I broke my fucking knee, man.  Oh, man.  It bent backwards.  Your kid.  Oh, my God.  Oh, motherfucker.  Where did this happen?  Ah, what the fuck? 
[03:07:30]  Where?  Both components are funny, but put together, it's just, might as well just listen to the  call.  Oh, my God.  I don't believe it.  Hold my hand, man.  Oh, no.  Hold my hand, man.  I've got to see some.  Oh, boy.  Ah, ah, ah.  Well, be sure and give the kids my condolences.  Oh, yuck.  God, that fucking hurts. 
[03:08:00]  He came down with the ball.  That's all that matters.  All right, well.  That stinks, stank, stunk.  I wish I was there, so when he said, I need something to squeeze, I could have pulled  out my mule, and he could have squeezed it with his mouth.  Hand-holding sissy.  Ah, ah, ah.  Dude, just put away, get some lipstick on me.  I want to feel pretty in the hospital.  Ah.  Well, all right.  Damn, Bob.  We got Marvel playing for the other day. 
[03:08:30]  We got, like, another 10.  Mm-hmm.  That was a good try, though.  Yeah.  When you have the different audio sources like that, you've got to mask it with some music  or something.  Or just make sense, you know?  Well, that's the first thing.  Who is this?  This?  I broke my leg, man.  Oh.  Who is this?  This?  It doesn't make sense.  I don't know.  Dundee!  And how are you supposed to hold someone's hand if you're on the phone with them?  Right.  Why would you call me a little dude?  Right.  Let's try this from JM. 
[03:09:00]  I have no idea how good it is.  Tell me when to stop if you hate it, Ann, all right?  Jim!  He's on your way down!  Oh, my God!  He's on your way down!  Oh, my God!  Oh, fuck!  They took my saddle in here.  Oh!  Broke my leg in the bed.  Oh, fuck!  I snapped my knee, man! 
[03:09:30]  I broke my knee, man!  Get it.  Time one more, dude.  I broke my knee, man!  No.  I broke my fucking knee, man!  Right back.  Right back.  Right back.  This is fucking horrendous.  On every level.  Send that shit to Bob and Tom.  On every level, that's horrible.  The music stinks.  You can't hear either the song or the audio that's being played with it.  And what?  Because the guy said broken leg at the beginning of the song?  Guys, calm down.  Guys, banked on that?  That was fucking brutal.  Calm down. 
[03:10:00]  The guy's trying.  Yeah, good for him.  Send in a camel toe song.  We'll all play that and elbow each other good nature of Indianapolis.  That blew.  That was really bad.  This is a camel toe song?  Oh, it's fucking awful.  Really?  Yeah, I know.  I said it again.  Now I'm all self-conscious.  See?  Aren't we?  Jesus Christ.  Now we're all just going to be quiet.  You know the torture I go through every day before I attempt to say the word put?  Because of these asses. 
[03:10:30]  We see it.  I actually stop.  You'll go like, put.  Stop what you're saying and say, put.  And I was listening to some old tapes of us that have to be six, seven years ago.  And I was saying, what, what, what, what?  And no one ever noticed.  But one asshat had it and fucking pointed out to me.  Now it's a torture every day.  I have to think about it before I actually say the word.  Want to try another one here, Anthony?  Yeah, because that stunk.  All right.  Yeah, we got to leave with a good one.  Here's Dan in Pennsylvania.  I love that. 
[03:11:00]  Ah, see?  I'll say.  Ah, fuck.  Fuck.  Oh, mommy.  Mommy.  It's been fun.  No, my hands.  Water.  Water.  I'm going to spray something.  Baby wants to bark. 
[03:11:30]  Get ready to fuck.  You fucker, fucker.  You fucker.  Don't you fucking look at me.  Oh, boy.  That was Bob Kelly meets Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet.  Blue Velvet.  That should be called, that was Awful Remix.  Horrible.  Follows Awful Remix.  That was really bad.  Come on, people.  This is a great bit. 
[03:12:00]  Step it up.  All right, let's try this one.  Bob Kelly meets Keitel from Reservoir Dogs.  We got a couple of these.  This one's from Ray from Deer Park.  I broke my fucking knee, dude.  Hold on, buddy boy.  I broke my knee, man.  Oh, excuse me, man.  I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine.  I broke my knee, man.  Uh, are you a doctor?  I broke my knee.  I broke my knee, man.  Answer me, please.  Are you a doctor?  No, dude.  Okay.  So you admit you don't know what you're talking about.  So, if you're through giving me your amateur opinion. 
[03:12:30]  I broke it, dude.  I felt a crack.  And?  You're going to be okay.  I broke my knee.  I broke my knee, man.  You're going to be okay.  Bye.  Say it the goddamn right.  You're going to be okay.  Ah, it's fucked up.  Who's a tough guy?  Who's a tough guy?  Come on, who's a tough guy?  You're a tough guy.  You're a fucking tough guy.  I just want you to relax now. 
[03:13:00]  Keith, you're not going to fucking die.  You're going to be fine.  When Joe gets here, I'll make you 100% again.  I'm in so much pain, man.  I can't do anything for you.  I'm in so much pain, dude.  Hey!  Just catch that shit.  Right now.  You're hurt.  You're hurt real fucking bad.  But you ain't dying.  I've got to squeeze some.  Please.  Go ahead and be scared.  You've been brave enough for one day.  Almost. 
[03:13:30]  I was waiting for...  It started really good.  I thought it started very good.  Yeah, it started good and then petered out.  Yeah.  I've got to interrupt this for one second.  Lady Di wants to say hi.  Oh, what happened?  Lady Di.  Lady Di.  I'm right here.  You want to say hi?  Yes, I do.  Say hi.  Hello.  Hello.  All right.  There's one more.  That will never get old, by the way.  If you do that 50 times, I'll enjoy it every time.  Fucking sea turtle calling in.  There's one more.  Mess. 
[03:14:00]  Bob Kelly stars in Reservoir Dogs again.  This one was done by chemistry.  Oh, okay.  Who's always good for a good one?  I broke my knee, dude.  I broke it, dude.  I felt it crack.  I'm in so much pain, man.  Can't do anything for you.  So when Joe gets here, it should be any time now.  He's going to help you out.  He's going to take care of you.  Come on.  Okay?  We're just going to sit here.  We're going to wait for you.  Hold my hand, man.  You want some water?  I got a sweet son. 
[03:14:30]  I broke that fucking thing.  I broke it.  You're not going to fucking die.  You're going to be fine.  When Joe gets here, I'll make you 100% again.  You're not going to fucking die, kid.  All right?  Listen to me.  Fuck.  You're going to be fine.  Fuck.  The kneecap is the most painful area a guy can get shot in.  Fucking me, man.  You're sick.  But it takes a long time to die from it.  I've been back.  I'm talking days. 
[03:15:00]  You're going to wish you were dead.  But it takes days to die from your wound.  God damn, man.  Ah.  Ah.  What the fuck?  All right.  That was good.  That one was put together well.  Chemistry.  How did he get Keitel saying kneecap instead of belly?  Yeah, I started thinking about that.  And I believe he said the kneecap and the belly are the two most painful places to be shot.  I think. 
[03:15:30]  I can't recall.  But that's Keitel saying kneecap.  Yeah.  What a great movie.  All right.  Hey, this is Lois Griffin.  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Send 202.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, man.  I thought they destroyed this bit.  No.  Oh, these are really funny.  They're the gay hazing stories.  Remember these?  Oh, yeah.  A lot of people in college, for some reason, when they're hazing in fraternities, they do  a lot of gay things. 
[03:16:00]  I wonder how this got brought up.  I can't really remember the original story.  Oh, God.  Somebody must have been in a fraternity and had to do something that was a little...  Hmm.  Oh, God.  For some reason, I'm seeing a marshmallow, but I can't quite remember.  God, I'm not listening to this program right now.  No.  Thank God.  Because we recorded this ahead of time.  No.  I'm still sleeping.  I'm hoping.  That wasn't me.  Thank you, Jimmy.  That was Jimmy.  I just had to show you how to do it.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[03:16:30]  Moving on to other things, Anthony.  Oh, I got to get to this fun story.  Yeah, obviously.  This is something.  This was one of your favorites.  One of my favorites.  One that kind of caught my eye and gave me a chuckle.  A drunken engineer yesterday pleaded guilty to severely injuring a pal by shooting water  from a fire extinguisher hose up his backside.  Brian Kennedy's lawyer described the assault as horseplay that went wrong.  The victim eventually needed surgery and had to be fitted with a colostomy bag. 
[03:17:00]  Kennedy will be sentenced later.  I guess these guys were working away from home as refrigeration engineers,  and the two men had been boozing it up at night in the city.  They returned to the bed and breakfast they were staying at.  The pair grabbed the extinguisher and soaked each other with it.  So up there, they work together, they're drinking a little bit, they get home, find a fire extinguisher,  they just start wetting each other down a little bit.  I got to jump in here. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  I remember you bringing this story to everyone's attention yesterday.  Uh-huh.  And we were talking about, like, you know, when you're with your pals, you're getting drunk,  you do stupid things when they pass out.  You might, some people have taken their dick out and you put it on your friend's forehead,  you take the shot.  Never did that.  I personally have never done that.  I could never even see doing that.  All right.  Or you write dick on his head.  That's what I used to do.  Or, yeah, whatever.  You draw a mustache on him.  All that dumb stuff.  But to actually...  Whipped cream.  To actually go about, you know, taking a fire extinguisher and placing it up your buddy's 
[03:18:00]  rectum.  Well, yeah.  It seems very gay to me.  A little bit, huh?  But, now, I was with you, because I'm thinking it's regular guys, until you just read that line.  What?  That they returned to the bed and breakfast where they were staying.  They were staying in a bed and breakfast.  Real men do not stay at bed and breakfasts unless they're with their chick.  Well, this seems to be...  They're working somewhere.  They were, like, working away from home. 
[03:18:30]  So, I guess, as refrigeration engineers.  And, I guess they needed a place to stay, close to the job, and their job could have put  them up in this bed and breakfast.  The jury's still out.  I don't think they're two gay guys, you know, going wine tasting and staying at bed and breakfast.  Well, refrigeration engineers.  Yeah.  Not gay.  Bed and breakfast gay.  So, I'm not sure where this story's going yet.  All right.  I tend to think, because they were working as refrigeration engineers, that the company  just put them up at this bed and breakfast. 
[03:19:00]  All right.  So, they grab the fire extinguishers, start soaking each other a little bit.  Ah, drunk off your ass.  Let me think, if I would go that far with maybe a co-worker or a friend.  You're drunk.  You find one of those big metallic fire extinguishers, the water ones.  Yeah, you might turn around and go, hey, asshole.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe.  I'll give it to you a little bit.  I still think.  I'm stinking a little gay.  A little gay?  A little that way.  That's gay?  What, do you look at it?  You want your, see your buddy in a wet t-shirt? 
[03:19:30]  No, but it would be kind of funny to just kind of, you know, yo, turns around, get him  with the fire extinguisher.  I'm sort of with you.  It's kind of funny.  I'm a little suspicious, but I'm with you.  I can see where that could possibly happen.  Go ahead.  When you're now fighting over it and soaking each other with it in some kind of impromptu  wrestling match, it's getting a little gay.  Getting a little gay.  Yeah.  The victim then decided to try to get some sleep.  So, he had his fun.  They're drunk.  You have your fun.  Back in the bed of breakfast, they squirt each other a little bit, whatever.  Time for bitty-bye.  All right. 
[03:20:00]  But Kennedy attacked him in his bed.  John Richardson, prosecuting, told the sheriff, the complainer was lying face down in bed wearing  some boxer shorts.  So, he's face down, wearing the boxer shorts, passed out.  He felt a hand on his shoulder and the covers being pulled below his waist.  Here's where the story just gets really gay.  All right.  Now, when you have to start pulling covers down and...  But, all right. 
[03:20:30]  He felt a hand on his shoulder and the covers being pulled below his waist.  This should have never happened because at that point, you're jumping out of bed going,  what the fuck are you doing?  At that point, I'd be going...  Jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep.  Jeep, jeep, jeep.  You want to fire a signature up your head?  He felt...  He then felt an object being placed near his back passage.  Oh, yeah, baby.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Why isn't the guy moving yet? 
[03:21:00]  Why isn't he moving?  Is that wasted?  Is he expecting something else?  The hands on the shoulders, the covers being pulled back, an object by his back passage?  Is he going, yes, finally.  See, man.  Something a little odd here.  Something a little fishy.  I love this story to begin with, but now, I don't know.  There's a lot...  It's getting a little gay.  He might have been...  This might have happened very quickly, and he's still drunk, and, you know, who knows?  All right, can I go to the phone really fast, Anthony?  Yeah.  I got to take my beating when it comes my way. 
[03:21:30]  Go ahead, Jim.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  Hello.  I just got a question, Opie.  If two guys playing with a fire extinguisher is gay, picking up marshmallows ain't?  I just wanted a drink with the sorority girls.  I just wanted to go to a keg party and fit in with the rest of the people at Geneseo State University.  Is that so wrong?  Ed in Oklahoma.  Hey, guys.  I was just wondering, when's the part where the Java log comes into play? 
[03:22:00]  All right.  Wow, he's reaching back.  All right, all right.  I'm going to have to tell that story for the new listeners one of these days.  Oh, yeah.  You just hold your breath waiting for me to retell that one.  Oh!  Quick!  Tell it!  I can't hold my breath alone!  All right.  Go ahead, Anthony.  So where were we?  He then felt an object...  We were laying in bed and...  He then felt an object being placed near...  Near his back passage.  ...to his back passage.  Almost simultaneously, he became aware of a loud hissing noise, which was the fire extinguisher  being a discharge. 
[03:22:30]  He was in immediate pain, but didn't realize the extent of his pain until he got up to go  to work and realized he was bleeding.  God damn it!  Are you fucking with me?  All right.  Now, the guy does this to him, and he doesn't get up and do anything?  You know, he didn't realize until the next day he was bleeding?  Wouldn't you get up and be like, oh, you motherfucker?  Like, what?  He just kind of went back to sleep?  Mm-hmm.  Either this guy is really, really drunk, or there's some gay thing going on.  But I think since they're out drinking, he's probably passed out. 
[03:23:00]  The victim was in agony.  He tried to stop the bleeding with toilet paper, but he had to go to the hospital.  So he's shoving toilet paper up there.  Ow.  He had surgery for severe damage to his rectum and large intestine, and doctors fitted a  colostomy bag.  The victim was forced to give up work.  Like, doctors do not know if he will ever fully recover.  Kennedy, 34, turned himself into police.  He was fired from his job as a result of the assault. 
[03:23:30]  Mm.  His attorney is saying there was no maliciousness.  It was just horseplay went wrong.  Now, that's not horseplay.  I've been drunk.  I've got to tell you.  I've been drunk a few times.  I've been drunk with my pals.  Mm-hmm.  I've been drunk with my pals, and we goofed off doing things that would probably be considered  horseplay.  Maybe be considered rowdy. 
[03:24:00]  Things like that.  You get in your car, you hit a few garbage pails, drive through people's backyards, knock  down mailboxes.  Things like that.  Never, ever, has putting anything near my friend's assholes ever come into play.  Ever.  The thought doesn't even enter your mind.  No.  You don't look at a fire extinguisher and go, I'm drunk, he's drunk, he's passed out.  Let me shove it up his ass and hit the trigger.  Yeah, you could think maybe if he's asleep, and that's the thing you would do probably if 
[03:24:30]  he's asleep, get the fire extinguisher and just, you know, wail him in the face with  it.  Mm-hmm.  That's funny stuff.  The ass does not, if you're heterosexual, the ass never comes into play.  Those football players that got in trouble for the hazing with the younger football players,  shoving pinecones, they thought, they saw pinecones and thought, let's shove these pinecones up  the young boy's asses.  And who went, yeah, that's a great idea, and not, dude, what are you, what are you, gay? 
[03:25:00]  Not one guy standing up for everyone else saying, what are you, gay?  And saying, no.  Instead they decide to be followers?  Aren't there a thousand other things you can think of during a hazing that does not involve  another man's asshole?  Whoa.  Well, I guess I voluntarily picked up that marshmallow and dropped it on what was supposed  to be the rival's frat house.  You should have spoke up. 
[03:25:30]  You should have said, guys, why are we doing this?  Can you not think of a thousand other things that did not involve our asses?  Right.  Good point, Anthony, good point.  You must have really wanted to be in that fraternity, man.  Being out of a fraternity was that bad?  Wow.  It's like another life.  What is the life of the guy that isn't in a fraternity at Geneseo?  Is it lonely?  Yeah, it's not a good life. 
[03:26:00]  Are you not getting chicks?  Back in the day, if you weren't in a fraternity or sorority at my college, you might as well  not even go out.  You're nobody.  Yeah, because, you know, everyone's obviously...  Fraternity guys are getting older.  In college, it was so superficial.  Yeah.  It was all about, oh, you're a SIGEP.  You're a FI SIG.  Wow.  You're cool.  Right.  You're a sticky ass.  No, I'm cool because I'm me.  It wasn't about that.  Yeah.  You had to be part of a fraternity to get the chicks, be cool. 
[03:26:30]  Honestly, thinking back...  And if that involves me squatting over a marshmallow, picking it up with my butt, and dropping it  on a fake fraternity's house.  I love that.  That had to be like a bombing run.  Hey, you know, we confessed some things on this show.  What can I tell you?  Certainly do.  You know, looking back at that, though, I can't even imagine I ever did that.  I swear, it's like looking at another life.  Neither can we.  It's like looking at another life.  Like, I already lived this other life or something, because I...  Ugh.  Yeah. 
[03:27:00]  But it should never involve another man's ass.  That's all I'm trying to say.  Let's go to the phones.  They've exploded.  Sean in Boston, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, Sean.  I'm calling because when I was a young lad in the Boy Scouts, an old hazing trick would  be to blindfold one of the younger kids, and to initiate them, so to speak, all you'd have  to do is have them do a sit-up blindfolded. 
[03:27:30]  Now, some people would fall for it, and other people would kind of be savvy to it.  You'd have another person hovering over them with their asshole exposed, so when they do  a sit-up, their nose enters the other person's asshole.  See, I can't defend...  Ugh.  It's awful, and it's very gay.  It's much like I attacked the ringleader of the group, so they kind of accepted me.  Hey, and you know what?  I'm not alone, man.  There's a lot of guys out there that have pledged fraternities and, God, the military, 
[03:28:00]  and they have these weird gay hazing things.  Yeah.  I'm not the only one.  Make all the fun you want, but you're sitting there in your car right now going, oh, God,  if anyone knew what I did to join, you know, the Weeblos.  The Weeblos.  I never understood that name.  Yeah, not at all.  David in Ohio, what's up?  Hey, boys.  How's it going?  Hi, Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Hello.  Oh, Jimmy's left?  Jimmy had to catch a flight to Dallas.  He's going to be at the Addison Improv all weekend long. 
[03:28:30]  I was going to say hi to Liddy, too.  I guess he took him with him.  Oh, well.  And if you're in Dallas, Jimmy will be on the Pugs and Kelly show tomorrow.  Mm-hmm.  And someone better call in.  Oh, no, I guess we might overlap an hour, so we can have fun listening to Jimmy tomorrow.  All right, go ahead, David.  Yeah, I got a story to tell.  When I was about 14, I was over swimming at a friend's house.  His name was Danny.  But anyway, he dared me and said, hey, I bet you can't swim from one end of the pool 
[03:29:00]  to the other underwater holding your breath the whole time.  And I said, I sure can.  So I held my breath at one end and swam all the way underwater to the other.  And when I came up gasping for air at the other end, his open bare a-hole was waiting  for me.  And my face just went right into it.  And he just lopped and lopped and lopped.  Because he can watch you coming towards him underwater, knowing where you're going to 
[03:29:30]  pop up.  Here's the game we're going to play.  You guys tell us these weird gay hazing stories, and Anthony and I will either tell you it's  gay or just funny.  Gay or hysterically funny.  I got to say that's just funny, because the first thing you want to do when you get out  of swimming the length of the pool underwater is take a deep breath.  And you're gasping for air, and you're gasping from the horror of what is in your face.  I'm going to go with plain funny on that story. 
[03:30:00]  You're going funny?  Yes.  Is there any other category funny with homo overtones?  Wow, that is funny.  David, that's really funny.  I'm going to go with just plain funny, Anthony.  That's funny.  Sean in Alabama, what's up?  What's going on, fellas?  I actually got two stories, one fucked up when a woman might be gay might be a little  bit funny.  All right.  Pledge and fraternity down at the University of Alabama, we'd have to do a thing called  bows and toes, and what it was was we got in trouble.  We'd have to get down to the basement, lie down on our stomachs, and we'd have to lift 
[03:30:30]  ourselves up with our toes and our elbows.  That was it.  Well, it gets fucked up when we'd have to lift up our elbows, and they put bottle caps  under them.  So we're sitting down there, picking ourselves up, sitting on bottle caps.  And we'd have to be there, you know, four or five minutes, and they have a thing called  direct TV, where we'd have to lift one elbow up and all our weights on our elbow on a bottle  cap.  That's it.  That's not gay or funny, sir.  The other one is there's another fraternity down at Alabama. 
[03:31:00]  It's the Deeks.  And right around Hell Week, they would have a goat tied to the front of the house.  And there's a story going around.  They'd have to, they tell their pledges, you have to fuck a goat to get in the fraternity.  If they'd say, okay, well, fuck the goat, they'd get blackballed and thrown out.  But for the one week, they'd have a black goat sitting in the front yard.  Oh, my God.  All right, Sean.  Thank you.  Thanks, bro.  All right.  Let's go to Spike in Chicago.  Spike, what's up?  Yeah, man.  The story about these guys on bed and breakfast kind of makes you wonder how many hands the 
[03:31:30]  guy has.  Yeah, right.  He's got one hand on the guy's shoulder.  He's pulling down the covers.  And then you've got to get the other one.  And then he's putting the fire extinguisher up his ass.  And then he's actually pulling the fire extinguisher.  Yeah, everyone knows you.  You work on a fire extinguisher with two hands.  Two hands.  Right.  Good point, Spike.  Thank you.  All right.  Much help.  All right.  Let's go to Gary in Indianapolis.  Gary.  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Back in the college days in the early 90s, we went and bought about six dozen donuts, 
[03:32:00]  just the regular glazed donuts.  And we made all of our pledges come in one night, and we took a dozen of those donuts  and made them stick them on their dicks, and we took Polaroids of them.  We made a sorority take the rest of the fresh donuts over to another fraternity, and they  gobbled them up.  Then the next day, we throw all the Polaroids over into their house.  Why would anyone eat donuts that were brought from another?  But they didn't know.  See, that's the gag.  Yeah?  They did, yeah.  The pledges got the donuts on.  See, I know this fraternity stuff.  I didn't do this one, by the way. 
[03:32:30]  Oh, no.  You did?  I did not.  Jesus Christ.  I've done enough stupid shit.  I don't need you guys piling more crap on.  So the donuts are on the pledges' penises, right?  Yes.  And you take all the pictures, and then you have a sorority, take the donuts, you know,  you put them right back in the box, and then the cute sorority girls with their little  half shirts and stuff, you know, bring them over to another fraternity house.  Oh, my God, yeah.  And, of course, they're having a little social, and the guys are going to eat the donuts.  Like, oh, look, the girls are giving us donuts, and they eat them up, and then the 
[03:33:00]  fraternity throws the Polaroids all over their lawn and in their house and stuff going, look  what you guys just ate.  That is grim.  All right.  Very good.  Thank you, Gary.  Thanks.  Let's go to John.  That's why I don't eat any donuts that listeners bring us.  I'm very afraid that the next day some pictures might show up in an email.  I don't eat anything the listeners bring.  Don't bring me anything, okay, people?  Kenny won't let us eat anything anyway.  No.  Thank God he's here.  Won't let us drink anything.  People bring me an open beer.  Kenny goes, nope, takes it away from me. 
[03:33:30]  Never, ever, ever lets me drink or eat anything.  Nothing but the best for you fellas.  Thank you, Kenny.  Jesus, your voice sounds very weak today.  So good to see you today.  Well, you know, I'm just very relaxed here watching you guys work.  Yeah?  Are you amazed by our talent?  I'll tell you, it is so overwhelming.  I'm just taking it back.  Do you have laryngitis or something?  No, I'm just like, you know, I'm mellow.  This is like a laid-back Kenny.  I'm not used to it.  I'm used to it. 
[03:34:00]  Hello.  It's Kenny.  Hi, handsome.  It's Kenny Cool.  Kenny Cool?  You know that?  Yeah.  It's Dice Cool.  It's Dice Light.  Dice Light.  Wasn't it?  Thank you, Kenny.  All right, Kenny.  We're going to move back to doing our radio show.  Jesus.  Jason and me, what's up?  You're not happy unless you're talking about gay stuff.  Go ahead, Jason.  Are you guys familiar with the Atomic Sit-Up?  No.  Atomic Sit-Up.  Yeah, it's an old private school gag on the hockey team. 
[03:34:30]  They guarantee the freshmen that they can't do a sit-up with a towel over their head, their  feet on the bench, and touch their elbows to them.  Oh, this is a, isn't this a Marine thing, too?  It may be.  It got pulled on me in private school.  Worst embarrassing moment as a freshman, 13 years old, could ever go through.  All right, listen to this one, Anthony.  Go ahead.  And as you're going to do the sit-up, one of the senior guys stands over the top of you,  and they pray for the towel in your face.  And as you're doing the sit-up, they whip the towel off, and the next thing you know,  your face is buried in the guy's ass cheeks in front of you. 
[03:35:00]  Hey, there's no reason for that.  Yeah, but as a freshman, you're just trying to be cool for those important seniors.  All right.  No reason.  Hey, Anthony, you want to learn what the elephant walk is all about?  Brian, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I had a buddy who went to a university in Indiana, and for their frat, they did the elephant walk.  Basically, you got one thumb in your mouth and one in the plush's ass in front of you.  And like every couple minutes or so, you got to switch hands. 
[03:35:30]  Oh, why would you stop it?  That does not really happen.  Swear to God, dude.  That does not really happen.  Swear to God.  Where do you find guys that would do this?  This is not happening.  No one would shove their thumb up another guy's ass and then allow another man to shove his thumb up your ass  as you go around and then pull it out and put it in your mouth?  I want to go on record to say, Anthony, I never had to do the elephant walk.  Oh, thank God.  As well.  I don't think you ever recover from that. 
[03:36:00]  You can't recover from that.  You have that mind control.  What?  You get a little crazy.  Your eyes have that.  There is not a thumb in your ass.  You are not putting that thumb that was in a man's ass in your mouth.  All right, boy.  Punching out.  All right.  The alcohol.  Mind control.  Yeah, you get all...  That's like a rape.  You don't just go home from that.  You become like Patty Hearst.  All of a sudden, it's just like, what?  Where am I?  Then everything's...  You're fine with it?  I'm robbing a bank.  What?  What happened?  What happened now?  No.  Hey, Anthony, some more stories on the way.  Let's say hi to Jeff.  Jeff? 
[03:36:30]  Hey, this is Jeff.  Can you hear me?  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, we had to play either Red Rocket or Davy Crockett when I played.  And you had the choice.  You either had to jack off a dog or fuck one of those hats with the big tail on it, and  the tail was hollow.  You had to just jack off with the hat.  Wait, wait, wait.  Why wouldn't everybody choose Davy Crockett?  What'd you say?  You either had to jack off a dog...  Right.  That's the Red Rocket part.  Or jerk off in a furry hat?  Yeah.  That's not a choice, my friend. 
[03:37:00]  A lot of guys chose the dog.  Who took the dog?  Does someone want to be silly?  Somebody, Randy, chose the dog.  Todd Johnson chose the dog.  A whole bunch of guys chose that dog.  I'm not buying it.  You saw this go down?  Yeah.  A lot of guys didn't choose the hat because they didn't know whose dick had ever been in  that hat.  Oh, I guess everyone jerks off in the hat?  Yep.  So, it's a bunch of...  Oh, wow.  Okay.  You never know if there's Ben Gay or something in the hat. 
[03:37:30]  No, you're just sticking your dick in a jizz-stained hat.  Exactly.  Right.  So, it's like jizz-crust in the hat, or you jerk the dog off.  All right.  That's...  Goddamn God.  No.  That's not funny.  That's just gay.  That's just gay.  Kidding.  I get to every month.  He's not listening to you, sir.  All right.  Let's say hi to Steve in Mississippi.  Steve, what's up?  Hi, man.  What's going on, guys?  How are you?  I'm doing great, man.  I just wanted to call to let you guys know that I heard about you guys for the first  time on Leno Monday. 
[03:38:00]  And when Leno announced that you guys was on XM Satellite Radio.  Oh, yeah.  I went out Tuesday morning, and I've been listening to you guys.  Well, this is my third day.  Wow.  See, that's how it happens.  That's very cool.  What do you think so far?  Oh, man.  Dude, I've been waiting my whole life for something like this.  I mean, it's great.  What's your observation?  It's only been three days.  It's always fun to get the observation of a newbie.  What do you think of this show in general?  Like, what are the things you've noticed, let's say? 
[03:38:30]  The one thing that I noticed is you guys are edgy, but you're funny.  But even though you guys are edgy and funny, there's still truth to what you guys say.  Oh, wow.  I like, and Steve, a very important question.  Have you ever seen the movie The Shining?  Yeah.  Okay, great.  You're a great, you're a perfect listener then.  Yeah, exactly.  That's a prerequisite to this show.  You're going to hear the lines from The Shining over and over and over and over again.  But it makes them laugh. 
[03:39:00]  You're being quite willful, Opie.  It makes them laugh every fucking day, the same fucking lines over and over.  But it just makes them laugh and laugh and laugh.  Isn't that odd?  I do find that strange.  I was going to ask you, I've been listening, I've been a hold a while, and I was just listening.  Does high school stories count?  Oh, yeah.  Yes, they do, sir.  Well, what we did in the high school was the top ten guys on the football team, 
[03:39:30]  or that was wanting to be like the co-captain or the captain of the team,  in our high school, I don't know if you guys know what I'm talking about,  but in our showers, it was like a round metal shower in the very center,  and there was like ten knobs.  Do you know what I'm talking about?  Yeah, I'm kind of getting it.  It's like a mass shower thing.  It's like a big room, and in the middle of the room is just a round cylinder,  and it's got, you know, shower heads.  Yep.  And they would handcuff the guy to hit each guy individually, 
[03:40:00]  and all the other guys would, like, get a towel wrapped up and wet it  and just flip them until they bled.  And then the top five guys that didn't quit, then the top five guys,  they would take a cucumber, put a condom over it,  and whoever could put it up their ass the farthest was the captain.  Get the fuck out of here.  It was the captain.  I mean, that's not really gay because...  That's not really gay.  How many years were you the captain?  Yeah, I didn't make it pass the towel feeding. 
[03:40:30]  Wow.  That is so gay.  I'm not the captain.  Well, that's really not gay because, I mean,  they're not actually touching each other, you know?  Yeah.  Sure, cucumber.  That's how they pick the wide receiver also.  It's funny.  There's a lot of us that have done these weird gayest things,  but we'll defend that it's not gay until I get it.  Well, that's not gay.  Cucumber up the ass?  Nah.  I heard Opie earlier, like I said...  Look, I will defend that.  I am not gay, but it doesn't look good  when you're picking up fucking marshmallows with your ass cheeks. 
[03:41:00]  Well, that's what I was going to tell you.  I've been only listening for like three days,  and I heard you say something a while ago about a marshmallow.  I don't know what that means.  Well, that's the beauty of the show, too.  You listen long enough, you catch up with all the inside jokes, too.  A marshmallow in your ass.  Because we tell the same fucking stories over and over.  Over and over.  And, sir, even though you're a new listener,  I will attest that these guys are real men.  They are macho.  All right.  Thank you, Kenny.  Hey, man, it don't matter if they're men or not. 
[03:41:30]  All right.  They're funny as hell.  That's all that matters.  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  All right, bye.  Yes, rosebud frozen peas.  Full of country goodness and green penis.  Wait, that's terrible.  I quit.  Hey, it's time for more fag talk.  Okay, sure.  Yeah, that's a lot of fun.  Why don't you come to my place?  I'll show you my beefy baloney.  Yeah.  Awesome.  Ho, ho, ho, demented honky. 
[03:42:00]  What's that?  I need that, man.  What's that?  I'm being hammered.  Red over.  Head down.  Red over.  Head down.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Is this a faggy show?  I'm just a flaming fag.  Is this a faggy show?  I would choke the chicken in front of everybody.  Give me the fag, faggy.  Oh, what?  Oh.  Give me the fag, faggy.  I'm horny.  Hey.  Stick it in and start the banging. 
[03:42:30]  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  This is tearing the ass out of me.  Shut the hell up.  He's a flaming fag.  I'll give you oral.  Put it in the mouth.  I always wanted those pipes.  Put it in the mouth.  You've got some funky tastics.  Fuck me.  Hell up.  Bah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.  Hell up.  Bah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.  Bah-ah-ah-ah.  Get your bong out.  I-I-I-I-you sick.  Get your bong out.  Yeah, you sure is. 
[03:43:00]  Do something like that.  You're just not in touch with your sensitive side, Anthony.  Bang!  You ever found monkey ass?  Opie.  Old heads gave Opie a boner.  Hey, what's up there, fruitcake?  What is your major malfunction, nut nut?  I just crap myself.  Lady, baby, man at home.  Lady, baby, man at home.  Bag!  This is very funny.  Jesus Christ, this is despicable.  Harry sack with ya.  I like doing oral on my dog.  I just want an erection so I can give it to my mom. 
[03:43:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  What?  XM202.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This program funded by the British Arts Foundation.  Hello, welcome to another edition of Fag Talk, the show where we talk about fags, or as they call them in America, cigarettes.  Let's not waste any more time.  Let's bring out Bob the Fag Man.  Bob, welcome to the show.  Thank you.  It's wonderful to have you here.  Glad to be here.  And what a wonderful subject it is today, as I looked over the notes before the show.  Right.  And it's sharing a fag into your bed.  After you've just made love. 
[03:44:00]  Right, and that's explained.  Right.  You're with your spouse, your significant other, or your boy or girlfriend, whichever it may be.  And afterwards, after that intimate moment.  Right.  What better way than to share a fag with your lover.  Exactly, right.  Pull the fag into bed and suck on it together.  What you've got to do is keep a fag nearby.  Right.  Prearrange this, you know.  In the room, right.  Right.  After you're done, say to your lover, would you like to share a fag with me?  It's very, very important to ask your lover, especially if you're not that familiar.  Maybe this is a first girl.  That's right.  You don't want to scare them.  So you just say, would you mind if we brought a fag into the bed for us to suck on? 
[03:44:30]  To suck on together.  Yeah, I'll suck a little, you suck a little, I'll suck you, suck back and forth, right,  sucking.  It's not like roll over and go to sleep.  No, no, no.  There's one more thing.  Let's have a fag between us.  It's the one common ground that we all have is enjoying a good suck on a fag.  Suck on a fag.  Love the fag.  Enjoy the fag together.  Suck.  Do the fag or suck.  Right.  Pass it over to your lover, let your lover suck on the fag, and back to you. 
[03:45:00]  It's wonderful.  It's very intimate.  Oh, yes, it is.  It's been a wonderful show.  Very nice.  Oh, Bob, thank you so much for being here.  Join us again.  We're out of time.  Next time, right here on Fag Talk.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Hey, this is Terry Jones here of Monty Python, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  XM202, the Opie and Anthony show.  Voss, J-O stories.  Yes, Richard was in studio, and he tells stories about jerking off.  Most of his friends, something he thought was completely normal. 
[03:45:30]  Some people call in to defend Voss by telling their own stories of jerking off with their  friends.  Right.  This is why we get paid the big bucks.  I remember this.  This was a lot of fun.  Rich was very funny.  I want to create a story with my two friends, Opie and Anthony.  Oh, yeah?  The three of us.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, you know.  Oh, yeah?  No.  No, it ain't happening ever.  You're listening to the best of Opie and Anthony.  Hit it.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hey, by the way, I just saw the news last night.  Viagra being used for children. 
[03:46:00]  It was the teaser.  And Viagra being prescribed to children?  Shame, shame, shame, shame on you.  Wow, you have it in the paper?  Is that what it is?  No, this is headaches.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, blindness and headaches if you...  Blindness.  When some people use the Viagra, I guess.  This is some...  Now, I'm thinking, I don't know.  I'm thinking some kind of psychological thing.  They give them to the little kid, maybe to stop him from bedwetting.  If he's got a rod all night, he won't be able to take a leak or something. 
[03:46:30]  If they fall out of bed at night, you give them a Viagra and it works like a kickstand.  They can't roll over and fall out of bed.  I don't know.  Or if you just want him to stay hard.  Or, yeah, the obvious.  You just need an eight-year-old with a hard-on.  It turned out to be some lung disorder.  Yeah, some lung disease.  They're giving Viagra to these kids with a lung disease because it opens up and helps them breathe. 
[03:47:00]  But they've got to explain why they're sporting wood, though.  I know.  They're breathing great, but what do I do with this thing?  You're going to school with a rod in your pan, covering it up with your lunchbox, all embarrassed.  That was a happy day at the last NAMBLA meeting.  Oh, our next topic, by the way.  Yeah, Viagra for kids.  All in favor?  Hi!  All right.  Next.  I used to get the rod, though, on the bus.  We talked about that for some reason.  Going to elementary school, junior high, even.  When I was taking the school bus, every morning, every morning, I would get on the bus, 
[03:47:30]  sit down, the bus would start going.  It had nothing to do with the rumbling, the vibration.  Everyone brought that up.  Just something.  I would sport wood on that bus.  I would get wood on the bus every day.  Did you do any friends?  Did you ever just jerk off with friends?  Like if you were sleeping over in our house, and you guys would just jerk off?  Not touch me.  No!  You never did that?  Look, and every guy around here is like, what?  Any time anyone tried that, I went, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep. 
[03:48:00]  I guess it was different in the service.  There's at least 15 guys around here right now.  If this has happened to any one of you, please come in and stick up for Rich Voss.  You might as well just lock the door and know it's coming in.  Me and Brian.  Wait, wait, wait.  I want to know, was it, would you lay there and talk to each other?  Would you be in the same, would you be right next to each other?  I don't know.  We might compare, or just because we were young, we were just starting.  Wait, so you'd show each other, hey, look at this rod, and.  Listen, we were like, I don't know. 
[03:48:30]  Bonnie, you sure you want to marry this?  21 or 22.  Bonnie's learning way too much about you.  Bonnie, I love these questions.  Oh, you have?  You added all this?  Bonnie, get on mic.  Bonnie's too good to just sit there on a couch.  Yeah.  Does this work?  Oh, it works better.  It works much better for you.  I'll even crank you up a little bit there.  Yeah, no, I've, I.  Wow, that's loud.  I've asked him all these questions.  I've tried to trick him into telling me gay stories.  Really?  Trick him?  Yeah, like, it turns me on, have you? 
[03:49:00]  That was the only one he copped to.  Yeah, I don't understand what, what it is, though.  You, you would lay there, are you in the same bed, the same room?  But we were like, junior high.  Is there a point on answering questions?  Yeah, yeah, like in junior high, when you sleep over your friend's house.  You sleep over your friend's.  Now, you're sharing a bed?  Yeah, well, I mean, you didn't have two beds.  You was in junior high school.  You sleep on the floor.  One guy sleeps on the floor, one guy sleeps in the bed.  You bring over your sleeping bag or something.  Junior high.  We're starting to get high.  So you're in the same bed. 
[03:49:30]  Are you naked in the bed?  No, we're wearing, obviously, our underwear and stuff, but then we.  Obviously?  You know, this was, God, this was years ago.  So you start cranking.  How does one go from talking about playing with GI Joes to, hey, you want to jerk off?  And wait a minute, why are we letting them slide on the whole junior high thing?  You're old enough to know.  Yeah.  You're old enough to know in junior high.  I can almost see if you're an 8, 10, like, whoa, what's going on?  You know, but you're talking about you're 13 or 14 at this point.  Yeah.  No, I was, we were like 15 or 16 because we were getting high. 
[03:50:00]  What are you trying to apply pre-count to real-life applications?  What the hell are you doing?  We were just, we'd never touch each other or, you know, say anything sensual to each other.  We were just.  But I want to know how you go from just a sleepover where normal people just go to sleepover,  you hang out, you watch TV, and then you go to sleep.  Because we were like 15 or 16 and we never had a girl yet, so we probably thought it was normal.  Yeah, but what happened, like, did you go, hey, did you, hey, take your pants down, 
[03:50:30]  I want to show you something.  Yeah, how does it start?  Yeah, thank you, Bonnie.  Come on.  We'd be high and then we would compare boners or something.  You don't just compare boners.  Like, how did you get a boner?  I smoked a lot of pot.  How did you get a boner?  I smoked a lot of pot with my friends and it never went from pass me the joint to,  holy shit, look at my boner.  It wasn't pot.  You would smoke bones, you didn't show off your bone.  We were doing THC, not pot.  I mean, THC makes you do stuff like that, probably. 
[03:51:00]  I don't know.  I did mescaline acid, believe me.  I did drugs, too.  Yeah, but you didn't.  It didn't happen.  Ecstasy doesn't make you do that.  How did this happen?  I don't know.  I guess it happened more like me and Mickey would and me and Brian.  I guess our whole crew, we just like to jerk off.  I don't know.  So you're laying in bed.  Uh-huh.  You start jerking off, I guess.  Uh-huh.  Out of nowhere.  When you're in the same bed with the dude.  How do you know it's not going to freak the guy out that you start jerking off?  We probably do it at the same time. 
[03:51:30]  No, you don't just do it at the three, two, one, go.  You don't just all of a sudden go, oh, my God, you're jerking off.  I just started jerking off, too.  Yeah, the lights like at Indy or a countdown.  Yeah, like a drag race.  That would almost be her three, two, one joke.  All right.  He plays football.  I know.  Give him a little flack.  I don't have a cool bedazzled watch like you.  He's too big to fuck with.  He just smashed you.  He's too big.  I know. 
[03:52:00]  I mean, no, I don't know.  I mean, someday if I ever run into Brian again, I'll ask him.  Why did we used to jerk off together?  I don't think I do it with Michael, but Brian, Mickey.  It's not the why we're after.  It's the how.  It's just how does that happen.  Right.  You don't just all of a sudden start jerking off together.  Like how many guys.  Someone has to make the first move, and that's what I'm getting at here.  What is that move?  Even though you're saying it's not gay.  And why did you go for it?  Right, right.  It's just got someone, one of you, had to make what is called the first move, where you  start going. 
[03:52:30]  You're assessing the situation.  You're looking over going, I think he'll be into me jerking off.  You're building this up in your head.  How.  Who made the first move?  And how many people said no?  He said no, and boss, you fucking faggot, what are you doing?  And Bonnie, what are you going to give the ring back?  What are you waiting for?  Jesus.  My God.  Don't leave me for another man.  You can't compete with that.  Was there porno involved?  Let's start there. 
[03:53:00]  We were too young for porno.  A pair of faucet.  Too young.  After something, you said you were heterosexual and something just went awry.  Yeah, Cheryl Teagues.  I don't know.  I don't have any answers.  The other far of faucet wastebasket.  Now, the reason I'm asking this is because I had the similar experience.  But I was in a tree fort in California with my friend Richard.  And it was just like a sleep out at the tree fort. 
[03:53:30]  And I was trying to go to sleep, and we had been drinking, too.  Of course, there's some kind of alcohol involved.  And he leaned over, and he goes, I'll suck your cock.  Yeah.  You want a blowjob?  And I went, I'm laying there going, oh, my God, I've got to just make believe I'm asleep.  I've got to stay here like I never heard it. 
[03:54:00]  So I'm just laying there going, I'll suck your cock.  And this is like a guy I've been friends with for years.  We used to ride our bicycles to go fishing down at Dana Point, ride horseback.  I mean, it's just a friend of mine for years.  Out of nowhere, out of the blue, I get, I'll give you a blowjob. 
[03:54:30]  So that, to me, is what I would call the first move.  Yeah, but that's gay.  That's gay.  But jerking off.  Dude, you're in the same bed.  Dude, you're in the same bed.  And when you're growing up, you don't get a big bed.  Right.  So I'm wondering if there was somebody that made believe they were asleep while you were jerking,  or perhaps you didn't find his dick attractive enough to jerk off with him. 
[03:55:00]  I want to know what was going on.  I guess we got, you know, we come back, we be high.  Like at Mickey's, well, Brian's house.  Maybe these guys don't want their names on the radio.  I don't know.  Call me crazy, but maybe you want to call them some different names.  They're somewhere in Jersey going, will you shut the fuck up?  So how did it go, boss?  I don't know.  I guess, I remember, like, you know, we'd go out.  I remember we went out one night.  You know, we'd just party because we didn't go to bars.  We were too young.  Sure.  We're all blasted. 
[03:55:30]  And we come back up.  You know, I guess we're hanging, we're laying in the bed, and, you know, never had a girl,  and, you know, you just start talking about jerking off.  Two guys.  Two guys.  Just two men talking about it.  Fat cocks, oil.  You know.  Do girls ever factor into it at all?  Like, I mean, the idea of one?  I will say it is impossible to, like, get girls at certain times in your life as a growing boy.  Yeah.  The possibility of getting a girl that's going to do anything to your dick, it just isn't there. 
[03:56:00]  Well, the first time, the first time I was defending.  But you could talk about it.  You could talk about it.  You could go, did you see so-and-so in gym class?  I mean.  Right.  Well, but the first thought I was going to have sex with me, or wouldn't, I was begging her.  I was young.  Yeah.  She goes, no, I'll give you oral.  You never changed your technique.  And I was.  All these years.  Oh, another for Bonnie. 
[03:56:30]  So, I'm begging her.  She goes, I'll give you oral.  You know, I'll blow you.  I go, no, because I never had sex.  So, I said, if you don't give me sex, I'll break up.  So, she finally said yes.  So, we walked over to the woods where we go.  And I didn't know how to do it.  I couldn't get it in.  I didn't know.  I didn't know the angles or anything.  Oh, no.  This and that.  I'm sitting there.  So, I couldn't do it.  I said, well, can you blow me now?  She goes, no.  So, I lost out on everything.  You passed up the blow.  It's like a game show.  You can have the blow job now, or pass the blow job to get laid. 
[03:57:00]  All right.  I'm going to go to get laid.  They never offer you the box you passed up again.  Oh, that is sad.  The box.  That is sad.  So, you lay in bed with men and decide to jerk off.  No blow job.  I'll go back to my guy friends.  Prison is not going to be too hard of a transition for you.  We're just laying in our cells talking about jerking off.  I still don't understand this.  I've been in football for, hell, almost 20 years now, around naked guys all the time, 
[03:57:30]  talking about girls, talking about whatever.  And not once has anyone ever been slightly around.  No.  And he's saying it like it's no big deal.  Football players just opt for maybe a pinecone up the ass every so often.  That's right.  Those are hockey players getting right, sir.  Wasn't that football camp?  Wasn't that football camp?  The pinecone up the ass?  No, it was some middle school thing or whatever.  I'm with Anthony.  It was football camp.  Don't get me wrong.  Hot is hot.  Whether it's hockey or football.  They ask for it.  Hey, Anthony.  Phones up the ass.  We've got a couple stories coming in. 
[03:58:00]  Let's go to Bob in Jersey.  Bob, go ahead.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I'm not really defending the way that Rick did it, but the same thing happened to me  when I was in junior high.  Really?  Yeah.  It was hanging out with my buddy.  And we were at his house.  We were in his bedroom.  We were in his den.  We had one of those angle couches.  You know, they kind of look like an L.  Yes, the modular sofa.  There you go.  He was on one side.  I was on the other side.  And he had one of them scrambler boxes. 
[03:58:30]  Yeah.  We were watching football through the channels.  Put some porn.  Whatever.  We've been drinking earlier in the night.  He starts doing his thing.  I'm like, what the fuck?  And I was going to go to him.  I'm like...  But then I'm like, hmm, what the hell?  So I get up off the couch, go behind the couch, peek over to the TV, keeping him out  of view.  And I did my thing.  Because if there's a couch in the way, it's not gay.  Yeah.  I wasn't exactly arm up against his arm, thigh against thigh on a twin-sized bed.  Well, no.  We were in a couch.  Listen, listen.  Don't you know.  Wow, Rich. 
[03:59:00]  He's painting a picture.  Man, this guy jerked off with his buddy and he made you sound gay.  I know.  At least he used the back of the couch as a barrier.  A gay barrier.  Yeah, really, Rich.  Jesus.  Sharing the Sealy Pospedic with another man.  Rubbing thighs with another man.  I did the couch.  Your knees need lotioning.  Did you guys hold a wallpaper for each other for the couch?  I did the couching, too.  That was just a contest so you could shoot over it.  We didn't really touch.  They didn't really touch. 
[03:59:30]  No, we weren't touching.  Might have been brushing of feet or something.  No, because, no.  Listen, first of all, I would have never been gay with him because he had freckles.  So, just, you know, I'm not going to do anything with a freckled guy.  Right?  Thank God.  Thank God.  Thank God you're not looking at me.  Would you finish up together?  I guess.  Yeah, you'd finish up.  You know.  Were there groans of pleasure going on?  I mean, we didn't do it.  What do you mean?  Did we do it simultaneously?  Well, I mean, not go at the same time.  Oh, wow.  That's a big word, Rich. 
[04:00:00]  And Bonnie threw her hands in the air and was very excited.  Why, Bonnie?  Bonnie's very excited because what happened at the restaurant the other night?  He asked if I was ordering off the entries.  The entries?  You want something off the entries?  Anything you want.  Order off the entries.  Entries.  E-N-T-R-E-E.  Big night out.  Applebee's, huh?  Who's this Al-A-Cart guy?  Is he bringing the food? 
[04:00:30]  Is he a terrorist?  Let's, yeah, a guy wants to defend Voss.  Let's see where this goes.  Wow.  Chad in D.C.  What's up, Chad?  The last guy did a great job.  Yeah, sure.  Chad?  Hey, Rich.  How are you doing today?  What's going on?  Hey, I just got a call.  I got to defend you, man.  I used to do the same thing with my best friend.  However, I am gay.  Oh.  Yeah, but when you did it, was he gay?  Yeah.  Were you?  Oh.  Were you both?  Okay.  Were you both gay at the time? 
[04:01:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  At 15?  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  Well, see.  Rich, it's a little weird.  I got to tell you.  It's not gay.  It's just a little weird.  But if you're laying there with another guy going like, oh, oh, making like noises as  you're beating off, that's just not.  Were you looking at him?  Were you looking at him?  That's not right.  No, no.  You wouldn't look at each other.  Oh, yeah.  That's gay.  Especially not in the eyes.  To this day, he wouldn't look at him in the eyes, I bet. 
[04:01:30]  You know, and we weren't loud because his mom was in the next room.  You don't want his mom to walk in with me.  We weren't loud.  Loud.  I don't think you ever want to say that.  No.  His mom was in the next room?  Yeah, that'd be horrible.  What are you guys doing?  Of course.  Coming in, watching.  That's what makes the story horrible.  Of course.  A little boy jerking off with another man.  Did you let him know when you were, like, did you go, I'm coming?  Oh, God.  I don't even know.  Here comes the goodness. 
[04:02:00]  Well, and then we would probably roll over and face the opposite ways.  We wouldn't sleep.  Did you say stuff like that?  Did you sleep in his wet spot?  Yeah.  Did you compare loads?  Look how much I got.  Mine went all the way to my knee.  That's not fair.  I jerked off with Bobby today.  I didn't have a good load.  Hey, Carl.  What's up?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I was, all right.  When my friend used to sleep over, we used to, like, jack off, but we never saw each other. 
[04:02:30]  We never did, like, you know, anything like that.  It's just I had, I was fortunate enough to have, like, the cool porno movie, and he didn't.  So we were, like, three feet away from each other.  He would be behind this, like, bench.  We never saw each other, though.  And it's like, you know, it wasn't, like, gay, like what Voss was doing.  Well, no, no, listen, jackass.  Here's the thing.  We didn't have the luxury of having a big room or a den or places to hide.  You're still in the room and you're both jerking off. 
[04:03:00]  Okay?  You know what's going on.  All, there was, he didn't have a big room.  You know, he was a poor.  I didn't have a big room either.  I just had a bench.  I just didn't look.  Yeah, but if you only have one bed and a dresser, I'm not going to lay on top of the dresser and jack off while he's on the bed.  That would be like some.  Kinky.  That would be carnival gay kinky.  You know, so if you're still in the room jerking off with the guy, it's the same thing.  You know, don't say I had a bench or something.  Go in the damn bathroom, for Christ's sakes. 
[04:03:30]  Yeah, what's wrong with just a private toss in the bathroom or something?  Who wants it to get out?  Who wants it by yourself?  You wind up doing that at home as a kid your whole life.  When you're living with your parents, you go into the bathroom, you do what you've got to do.  You come out, you go out with your friends.  No, Rich jerked off with his dad.  Are you kidding?  Is that a real story?  No.  You never know, though.  I know, you just never know with Rich.  Well, Ant, there's a lot of stories coming in.  We'll go to Texas for this one. 
[04:04:00]  Frank, go ahead.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Me and my friends, there was about five or six of us, same thing, we were like partying,  we were sleeping in the basement, so we put on a horn, and eventually we were all just like,  all right, we either got to shut this thing off or take care of business, so we all decided to take care of business.  We all had blankets over us.  Next morning, we went to sleep right after.  Next morning, we woke up, didn't even acknowledge each other, didn't even look at each other.  It was just horrible. 
[04:04:30]  Well, that was five.  Now, that's...  Do you talk to or see these people anymore?  Have you?  I haven't seen them in years.  In years?  No, not in years.  Would it be all awkward?  No, I used to hang out with them throughout, you know, I just stopped hanging out with them when I quit drugs,  because they were still on, you know.  There are those people you shouldn't hang out with.  I went back out to California back in, I guess it was, 88 or 89, somewhere around there.  I went back out to California.  You ran into Richard?  And there was Richard, because he was friends with my father and stepfather out there.  Is he a gay gentleman now, or? 
[04:05:00]  Flaming.  Flaming.  We were going to go hunting, so we all, you know, pack up just guns, so many guns,  and get in the blazer, drive up in the hills to go hunting.  Richard didn't go.  He went with Corey, who was my father's wife, to go curtain shopping.  Yeah.  I mean, flaming.  And it was all weird.  Like, we got there, and Richard shows up, and he's like,  Hi, how are you? 
[04:05:30]  It's been so long.  I haven't seen you.  And I'm like, oh, this explains everything.  What's your thing in your head?  How didn't I know at the time?  Well, I figured a few years have passed.  I took the blowjob.  Hey, how about a rain check on that?  You look like you're good at it these days.  Probably has a lot of experience.  Well, you can't get a rain check, or else I would have found that girl.  Right.  You would have been able to get it in the woods.  All right, let's go back to Jersey, the home of whacking off with your friends.  Eric?  The home of whacking off.  Is that the new state motto? 
[04:06:00]  I think so, man.  McGreevy was in there, made that the state motto.  They like to call it the McGreevy.  Let's hear your McGreevy story.  Go ahead, Eric.  I love McGreevy, by the way.  Yeah.  Yeah, so I walked into a, you know, party one day.  I'm about first of the year.  I go down.  My friends, they call me over.  So I walk into the room, and there's seven guys lying in the basement in sleeping bags  with soft core porn all going at it at the exact same time.  Oh.  It was horrible.  When all the sleeping bags are just going, tr-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t. 
[04:06:30]  Rumbling.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Absolutely disgusting.  A lot of dirty tissues next to it.  No fucking joke.  We didn't have the luxury of porn.  All right.  Well, let's go to Tyrod in PA.  Tyrod?  Tyrod.  Hot Rod?  No.  Hot Rod.  Hot Rod.  This can't be good.  Hot Rod.  Oh.  Oh.  I can't believe I got something in common with Spithead.  I can't believe it.  15 years old, looking at a hustler, right?  Camping out in the woods, got nothing better to do. 
[04:07:00]  All of a sudden, somebody says, who's got the biggest dick?  You know who said that?  The gay guy.  The gay guy said, who's got the biggest dick?  Hey, I got a contest, guys.  Who's got the biggest dick, by the way?  Flaming fact.  Right.  Listen, listen, it's a contest.  It goes from the biggest dick, who can come the fastest, okay?  So then it was who came the fastest and then who shot the farthest.  But then we all feel bad, right?  It's like 11 o'clock at night.  We're 15 years old.  We're all stoned, right?  So then we go and we find the neighborhood girl. 
[04:07:30]  And we all get hand jobs because we feel bad and we feel, you know, like we do all things.  How does that happen?  Stop it.  We find the neighborhood girl and go, hey, give us a hand job.  There's always that neighborhood girl in the woods.  You know, wanting and willing, right?  She's always around, Ed.  You just got to find her.  Half a block, half a block away, she'd do anything for you.  Yeah.  By the way, the neighborhood girl's name was Mike, wasn't it?  Okay.  First of all, how pathetic are you that you're camping a half a block from the road?  Okay?  You're not camping.  You're laying in somebody's backyard under a tree, jacking off with friends. 
[04:08:00]  You're being gay in the woods.  Gay in the woods.  Woods right by the...  We're out camping.  Camping.  And the neighborhood girl who, you know, Swiss family Robison's daughter, we go over to  her fucking tree house.  You're a liar.  Let's say hi to...  Liar.  Let's say hi to Brad in Dallas.  God, these calls are coming in like crazy.  Everyone jerking off with their friends.  I missed out on a great childhood experience.  Yeah, you were busy shoving marshmallows in your ass and walking in a rat house basement. 
[04:08:30]  Which, by the way, is fine, Odie.  It was called Bomb the DK House.  Right, right.  You had to pick up a marshmallow with your ass cheeks and...  Yeah, we know.  What's the weirdest thing you ever fucked?  What?  The weirdest thing like you ever fucked.  That you ever fucked?  Yeah, that's right.  Jerk off with.  Isn't there two choices?  A girl or a boy?  Are you talking inanimate objects?  Yeah, like jerking off with something.  Like he ever...  You know, like my friend.  Like a Brillo pad?  My friend.  Oh, wow.  Now I'm sleeping with a black chick.  No, my friend. 
[04:09:00]  Oh, my God.  My friend used to cut...  He used to cut a hole in government cheese, right?  And he was on drugs.  Oh, yeah.  I told you.  Did I tell you the story?  Yeah, and microwave it for a little bit to warm it up.  Yeah, I told you this.  And then fuck the government cheese.  Butter roll.  You ever take a butter roll and cut a little of your hair off to make it look like there's  hair on it?  Put hair on it because you never knew it.  You never got laid, so you cut.  No, I used to do the fingers together.  If you do the...  You put your hands together like you're praying. 
[04:09:30]  Right.  And now...  Here.  I'm not doing...  Oh, man, we get a visual.  I'm not doing...  No!  No, I'm not doing that with you.  You put your hands together like you're praying.  Like you're praying.  Why would I do this experiment for everybody?  One guy does it like they're praying.  The other guy does it like you're praying, but turn your hands sideways now so they're flat.  Yeah.  Then you open up between your middle and ring finger.  Right.  Your ring fingers as your hands are still together.  Then you put them together.  Are you...  You're not...  Are you a homophobe like Opie? 
[04:10:00]  Or you want to check this out?  I'm trying to figure out what the hell you're doing.  Anthony, the person that doesn't want anyone to touch him wants someone to do this experiment  with him.  I'm talking about jerking off and you go, the other guy.  Where was the other guy?  Where's the other guy?  Who's this other guy?  You're interlocking hands.  Then you interlock hands, no, and then you open up your hands and look and it looks like  a pussy.  Right.  So you're not actually shagging it.  That's all...  That's what you would do.  Here, go ahead.  Put your hands together.  Yeah, this is...  And then I look.  You go, yeah, now turn sideways.  Now look.  Oh, wow. 
[04:10:30]  It's my magic trick.  And then you lay in bed with your friend.  I have...  I think Parcells just fired me.  Thank you.  I have done that, actually.  Yeah.  Of course.  Every guy growing up...  But he was talking about the screenest thing you...  You fucked.  No.  Or jerked off of it.  No, you...  Right.  But then he was saying that the butted roll would look like it.  Well, you didn't...  You wouldn't fuck the butted roll, would you?  Well, you cut a little of your hair so you think there's hair on...  You know, like a pussy.  You would actually jerk off with the butted roll.  You've got to try everything once.  No, I didn't.  Oh, my God.  It's got little seeds on it. 
[04:11:00]  The little caraway seeds.  Chafing.  Wow.  All right.  Well, you want to take one more?  Another guy that jerked off with his friends.  Jason in New York.  Jason, go ahead.  Hi.  How are you guys doing?  Nice.  I've had a similar experience, but mine basically started out, I guess, the first move being a  truth or dare game.  You know, where I, you know, I actually thought it was perfectly normal for best friends to  be doing it.  It's sort of like I always had the friends.  Well, I've never jerked off in my life. 
[04:11:30]  It's basically a bunch of bullshit.  Are you saying, what are you saying?  Basically, I've jerked off with my friends, too.  Perfectly.  I'm not gay.  Don't have any gay thoughts, but I've done it.  Yeah.  And it's no big deal.  And, yeah, it's no big deal when you're young.  That's something guys do.  You're grown up.  I mean, I remember when I was younger, and, you know, me and, you know, friends, you'd  play doctor and stuff.  That was, you know, but you were young, and you couldn't even get hard, so it was a waste 
[04:12:00]  of time, you know.  But, you know, you just touch.  I would do that.  Play doctor and perform mastectomies, which kind of got the neighborhood kids a little  scared.  Boomer from Jersey.  Boss, reality check.  Jerking off with a guy in the woods is gay.  Jerking off with a guy in bed isn't.  You're bashing a guy for jerking off with another guy in the woods.  Meanwhile, you were in bed with a guy.  You were in bed with a guy? 
[04:12:30]  Well, I wasn't in bed.  I was sleeping over with a guy.  You were in his bed.  You were in his bed.  You said you were in bed.  You shared the same bed, and you were jacket in bed.  With these little New York Mets sheets.  Smiling Mr. Met face.  Right.  Looking at you in shame.  Nothing like that for a girl.  Bonnie, was there any ever growing up with another girl at a girl's party?  Help us out here with a hot, let's make sure. 
[04:13:00]  I didn't masturbate until I was 18.  Really?  Yeah.  So there wasn't any, like, cool stories?  Do your girlfriends tell you stories about that when they're sleepovers?  There were, yeah.  I mean, there was a couple of stories about, you know, a girl got fingered.  Fingered.  Yeah, that was a biggie.  That was a biggie.  It sounded horrible.  It's dead?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's gotta be.  A little 15-year-old digging in there like he's trying to pull out a booger out of his nose.  Yeah, she's digging his shit.  So I fingered her. 
[04:13:30]  She was digging it.  Yeah.  She's wincing.  Ouch.  Let's say hi to...  You guys know nothing back then.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Jersey.  I tried to eat a pussy and she didn't even, you know, she couldn't get past the first bite.  Fuckin' bitch.  Go ahead, Jeff.  Well, is there any question if a boss is gay?  Didn't you use the suck dick for drugs?  No, that was all bullshit.  I never sucked a dick for drugs.  You know, I tell a story about, you know, whatever the joke was. 
[04:14:00]  Yeah.  And these people, I mean...  Oh, they'll pick up on it.  I know, listen, I've done some wild things for drugs.  I'd rob, I'd steal, I'd connive, but I never sucked a cock because I know if I would have  got money doing that, I'd be, you know, doing it, whatever.  But I know I never, you know, something...  You'd be good at it, right?  You're funnier.  It's got to be embarrassing if you're gay and you're real good, or not gay, and you're  really good at sucking dick.  That's got to be embarrassing.  You're just a prodigy.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck. 
[04:14:30]  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Ouch.  What do you mean by private, Tom?  Great, Charles.  Well, I mean, it's...  What do you want to do here, Ant?  The phones have exploded.  Everyone wants to admit that they jerked off with their pals.  Nick in New York, go ahead.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Actually, there was a group of friends, and one of the guys came up with the idea of doing  a circle jerk, and we were like, nah, man, forget that, and we all got weirded out.  And now, the funny ending to the story is that about five years later, I ran into the guy, and 
[04:15:00]  he turned out to be gay, man.  I'm talking about Liberace gay.  Oh, yeah.  Liberace.  What, dead from AIDS?  No, no, no.  That's Liberace gay.  That's true.  All right.  Anyway, punch it out.  We'll take one military story, and then we'll take a break.  Brad in Dallas, go ahead.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  When I was stationed in Japan, I was on a ship in the Navy, and the first girl that 
[04:15:30]  we got stationed that was sent to our ship, her first job was to clean the bathroom.  We used to all feed off then.  God damn.  Lucky her.  We used to, like, feed it off and throw it on the walls and shit.  So she goes up there, and she cleans all the small walls, and she hangs this, like, thick  cardboard paper on the walls that we used to use to, like, lay on the floor whenever we  were painting or whatever.  She lines the walls with this shit so that when she has to clean it again, she'll just  rip the paper off the wall. 
[04:16:00]  So we get the idea that now when we feed it on the wall, we're going to throw it on there  and autograph the shit.  Like a fucking monkey cage.  That's great.  You got to put papers on it.  That's great.  I was going to move on, Ant, but Tin Man, I mean, Tin Man.  How do you do that?  Yeah, say what you have to say, Tin Man.  We had a shit out of the front with a lampshade.  You had sex with a lampshade?  Is that your first time with a Jew?  Oh, my God. 
[04:16:30]  You look at the second, and it's thick in it, and you know, the top of the lampshade where  it sits on the light bulb, it's like.  Oh, God, boss.  Wow.  I'm hearing you, sir.  Go ahead.  I have no idea how he does this.  Well, you know the metal part that hangs on the actual light bulb?  Right.  Is that what you were having fun with?  Yeah.  How would you have sex with that?  Well, you lubricate it with Vaseline, and you know, you make sure you have a condom one.  Isn't it metal? 
[04:17:00]  Yeah.  But he's got the condom, and he lubricates it really, really good.  I could find ten other things around the house that I'd rather fuck than a lampshade metal  bracket.  I didn't have many options.  You didn't have many options.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Jerk in an army.  First one done.  Had to what?  Had to what?  Army.  Had to do dishes.  What?  Anthony.  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey.  Hey, we met a bunch of guys, man, when we was in the military.  I had four roommates.  We used to get together, put pillows up, and block ourselves off. 
[04:17:30]  The first one done beating off.  Had to do the dishes.  First one done?  Why don't you just go really slow?  You wanted to prolong it?  Yeah.  I know.  Yeah, the good guy, the guy that can prolong it.  Yeah, wouldn't it be, yeah, the last one done?  The first one, man.  The jerk-off session would take 30 seconds.  Yeah, we're getting a bunch of these.  Rob from Jersey.  I used to bang my couch while looking at pictures of the 1996 girls' gymnastics team. 
[04:18:00]  Who was on that team?  I don't know what's weirder.  Wasn't that the one with Carrie Strug?  Was that the Carrie Strug year?  And it's Dominique something.  Dawn.  Yeah, yeah.  Dawn or whatever.  Dawn's.  That's perverse.  That's really perverse.  No, it's gay to know the gymnastics team from 90s.  Why?  To know anything.  Can I know the weightlifters or ring guys?  Yeah, Voss.  We like girls.  You know the girls?  Oh, you're right.  That's not gay.  You're right.  Perky girls.  No, I mean the gay...  Sorry we don't know the Greco wrestling team. 
[04:18:30]  Simga...  Kim Zemeskel.  Yeah?  Kim Zemeskel.  That was her?  See?  That year she was in that one?  Yeah.  This guy used to cut a slit in liver or steak.  Oh, God.  And have sex with it.  It's so gross.  And then fry it up and eat it.  You marinate your own steak.  What the hell?  This guy had sex with an entire deli ham.  I didn't know where to blow cheese on my steak.  He bored a hole in it and pounded away in the walk-in refrigerator at a deli I worked 
[04:19:00]  at.  Not sure if it ever got used because I got fired that night.  Oh, God.  Ew.  All right, Anthony, one more phone call.  I'm sure.  It's been pointed out that there is no irony at all in the fact that Voss plays Scrabble.  Are you good at it?  Four-letter word.  He plays expert.  No, not expert.  I play advanced.  You play expert.  I play advanced.  Online?  No, against the computer, against me. 
[04:19:30]  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I was playing chess online until I found out I was beating 10-year-old kids.  I know.  I felt guilty on so many levels.  I'm like, what am I doing conversing with a 10-year-old online, first of all?  You want to jerk off after this game?  I know.  I have a slumber party tonight.  I started getting back into chess really fast, so I was playing online, and I'm just  kicking ass left and right.  And finally, and I'm thinking I'm just playing people around my age, and all of a sudden,  someone decides to converse with me. 
[04:20:00]  He's like, wow, you're pretty good.  How old are you?  I'm eight.  And I'm like, I couldn't cop until my real age.  I'm like, oh, I'm 15.  I do a check, and that's too old.  I know, and I was too old.  I tried playing checkers against people.  You want to play again?  No, the babysitter said lights out.  And it's bad that you're now lying about your age and conversing with him, because if it's  a cop, it's like, okay, here's a guy now lying about his age.  I was done at that point.  When I found out there were eight-year-olds, 10-year-olds, 12-year-olds, I'm like, I can't 
[04:20:30]  do this anymore.  There's just something very wrong about this, even though it's an innocent game of chess.  Darren in New York, what's up?  Starts that way, and then someone's got a bishop up their ass.  Hey, what's going on over there?  How we doing?  We're having a good time today.  Yo, before I even get into my story, I just want to let you guys know, man, I'm so happy  to hear you guys again on the radio.  It seems like I was so depressed when you guys walked.  I've got to tell you something really fast, Darren.  I'm reading the email every day, and it seems like just only recently, a lot of our old 
[04:21:00]  fans are really starting to find us and get the XM.  It's really strange.  Listen, I went out and bought a brand new car just to get XM put in it so that I can  listen to you guys.  Oh, thank you, Darren.  I went out and bought one of those, not my car, the Delphi ones, and I tried putting it  in my car, and it just, I would get intermittent service, so I had to get rid of it, and then  I got you guys online.  I found out that I could get you guys online, so I used to listen to you at work, and now  I say, you know something, I have to get an XM car. 
[04:21:30]  I've got to get a car with XM so I can listen to you.  All right, all right, Darren.  All right, get into my car.  Now, the guy who ever answered the phone, he doesn't believe me, but what I used to  do when I was younger, much younger, I used to use my grandfather's sander, an electronic  sander, and I would, you know, throw my dick kind of like down in between my legs and put  the sander there, and it gives you a sensation.  It gives you a real nice sensation.  Like a belt sander or a vibrating, like? 
[04:22:00]  A vibrating sander.  All right, I've seen these kind of sanders.  They're like circular.  No, they go back and forth.  They go like that.  I've seen the ones that kind of go in a circle.  They're rounding on a circle, or the square ones that kind of go forward and back.  Exactly.  Exactly.  I found out by accident.  One day I was on my bike, and I had the sander, and it was on, and all of a sudden I was  like, holy shit, what the hell is that?  I said, hey, wait a minute.  That feels kind of good.  Listen, I tried, and I tell you, for a couple of years, I used to speak out at the base,  and everyone was asleep. 
[04:22:30]  But everyone was asleep.  You just brought back a memory.  I used to rock the weed whacker.  What?  Oh, yeah, man.  I used to rock the weed whacker.  What?  The vibrations that came off that thing?  My parents couldn't understand why I wanted to weed whack around the house like once  a week.  Would you push it against the handle?  Yeah, the whole thing would just...  No, not...  I thought you had a...  Well, you've got to explain.  It's like...  Listen, guys, I'm punching out.
