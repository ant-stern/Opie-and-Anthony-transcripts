<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a technical malfunction involving a sound effect of a bull's backside, immediately setting a raucous tone for their anti-Valentine's Day themed show. Opie shared a particularly brutal breakup story, detailing fifteen increasingly explicit answering machine messages from his ex-girlfriend, culminating in her and a new boyfriend having sex while recording a message for him. He recounted the subsequent airing of these messages on his previous show and the resulting lawsuit.  This launched a segment of listener calls filled with similarly vicious breakup stories, one involving a listener sending explicit photos of his ex to her parents.  The calls also featured humorous complaints about Valentine's Day commercialism, unconventional marriage proposals (including one involving anal sex), and satirical mockery of other New York radio stations' Valentine's Day programming, complete with parodies of love song dedications and on-air personalities. The hosts and callers also dissected the absurdity of Valentine's Day cards and gifts found in stores like Duane Reade.

The show then transitioned into a segment featuring a caller, Danny, recounting his girlfriend's undisclosed abortion.  This segued into more vulgar Valentine's Day-themed jokes and hateful listener messages.  In-studio guests included comedian Old Dirty, burlesque performer and former Miss Nude Universe Candy Apples, and comedian George Wallace.  The conversation devolved into sexually charged banter, repeated calls for Candy Apples to disrobe, and heavy promotion of "horny goat weed."  Candy Apples repeatedly plugged her appearances at Double D's in New Jersey, while George Wallace discussed his career and promoted his shows at Rascals.  Numerous callers contributed to the crude and sexually suggestive atmosphere.

A subsequent segment continued the chaotic mix of guests and callers. Candy Apples' interview focused on her Miss Nude USA experience, with humorous comparisons to the NCAA tournament. George Wallace engaged in banter, boasting (exaggeratedly) about his acting career, and fielding jokes about his weight.  The hosts discussed and heavily promoted George Wallace's and Candy Apples' upcoming performances.  A significant portion centered on Opie's new Lexus IS-300 and his reckless driving. The introduction of "Stalker Patty," a self-proclaimed stalker of the show, added to the suggestive and crude humor. The segment concluded with a barrage of listener-submitted "F.U." Valentine's Day messages filled with profanity and angry outbursts.  The overall tone remained irreverent, vulgar, and highly comedic throughout the entire broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  8 minutes of pure adrenaline. It's Ben.  W. Ben E. W. now concludes its broadcast day.  Stay tuned for W. O. N. A.  On 1027 W. N. E. W.  O. P.  Oh, God damn it!  No! 
[00:00:30]  Son of a bitch!  No!  Oh, God damn it!  No!  Turn it off! Turn it off!  I'm a mental case.  1027 W. N. E. W.  You don't know so much.  Oh, hey! 
[00:01:00]  There's an oversight anyone could have missed.  Whoop!  Knowing that the whole joke there is the bull ass.  Whoop!  Hey.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, Rick.  I'm pissed off, Rick. How are you?  Rick, what happened?  Wow!  I forgot to hit save after I put in all the beats, so it didn't say the beat.  Whoa!  I was starting to get into that, too.  Nice head, steak, bull ass.  All right.  Do it quick on the fader. 
[00:01:30]  It still went over the air.  We had it though.  Damn it.  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  It's the L&A Show, 212-757-1027.  Right off the bat, if you're tuning in to hear a mushy Valentine's Day show, go after yourself.  Go somewhere else.  Love.  This is dedicated to the people that hate Valentine's Day. 
[00:02:00]  Dedicated to the people that have someone that did them wrong in their lives.  When I think Valentine's Day, you know what I think?  I think I have to go to court tomorrow.  I wish they would have done it on Valentine's Day, you know?  I wish they would have made one of my court appearances on Valentine's Day.  That would have been nice.  This is the anti-Valentine's Day show.  We're going to take some calls from guys and gals that want to get a case of love songs. 
[00:02:30]  Nothing but love songs.  But, eh, wrong.  Try again.  Wrong.  Try again, dumbass.  That's right.  But I have no place to go.  I don't know why that's wrong.  Eh, eh.  I don't know why that's wrong.  I'm surprised David Hickley from the Daily News didn't add us to his little list of things that are happening for Valentine's Day, Anthony. 
[00:03:00]  Love is in and on the air.  Ho, ho.  It's not love songs.  All love songs.  Nothing but love songs.  But it is Valentine's Day.  And I guess stations around New York City, Opie, do a special Valentine's Day show.  It's a very big day.  All the program directors and air personalities get together and do a little brainstorming and come up with cute little Valentine's Day theme ideas.  By the way, we're going to be marrying some couples in the middle of Times Square later in this afternoon. 
[00:03:30]  Let me tell you something.  We got about 50 couples being married on top of the World Trade Center.  Look at Anthony and I.  This afternoon.  We're in our white tuxedos.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  We're going to be the master of ceremonies on the stage.  Just imagine all the wedding photos.  In the middle of Times Square.  All the wedding photos.  And we'll be in the background saying, hi, how you doing?  Hey, hey, you have a great life together.  And right after we marry all the five couples from all over the Tri-State area, we're going to be boarding a bus. 
[00:04:00]  And we're going to be taking them all to Atlantic City for the biggest doggone reception you've ever seen.  That's right, Anthony.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, my God.  I got an idea.  Let's get a happy couple and have them married on the air in the studio.  Right here at our studios.  Uh, no.  So what are they doing?  What are some people doing?  Well, yeah, let's give them a plug. 
[00:04:30]  WFUV.  What is that?  We'll be featuring love songs all day on City Folk today.  All right.  You guys from all the radio stations can thank us later.  WBGO.  As the John Pizzarelli Trio playing live 8 to 9 p.m. tonight from Arthur's downtown in New York.  Oh, in Newark.  Oh, Newark.  I'm sorry.  Uh, WVNJ has the best American love songs all day long for you. 
[00:05:00]  This Valentine's Day, we're going to be playing the best American love songs all day long.  Happy Valentine's Day.  To you and yours.  Uh, WNYC has offbeat love songs at 11.  Oh, offbeat.  We're taking the comic angle.  Uh, New Sounds with John Schaefer.  Cousin Brucie.  Oh, CBS.  Takes a week off from his Wednesday yearbook show to do a love book of great love songs.  7 to 10 p.m. tonight. 
[00:05:30]  Love book.  CBS FM 101.1 on your FM dial.  CBS.  CBS.  Wow.  He's taking a break from Wednesday's yearbook show.  I believe they take a year.  Oh, my God.  Like, you know.  And now, 1976.  Oh.  You remember, Smokey and the Bandit was in the movie theater.  You were watching The Love Boat on TV.  And this was on the radio.  On the radio. 
[00:06:00]  Afternoon delight.  Afternoon delight.  Ah!  Tonight, Chicago died.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Ouch.  Uh, Amy Page of, uh, WNYC is pretty certain to mention Valentine's on her nightly love song segment starting at 11 p.m. tonight.  She does a nightly love song segment, so now it's, uh, it's very appropriate. 
[00:06:30]  There you go.  WX, uh, WQXR will play great romantic classical music all day like Romeo and Juliet.  So they play ancient songs.  Classical music.  This one taking you right back to 1859.  Here's the Gregorian Chats.  This one's great.  This came out about 120 years ago.  But it still means something to someone today.  Ha, ha, ha.  Remember, you were trying to cross the United States in a covered wagon. 
[00:07:00]  And if you had a radio, you'd be hearing this.  Ha, ha, ha.  Wow, I got my radio voice back though, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Off the air, Z-100's boarding team of Elvis Duran and the Zoo will join Brides Magazines live this afternoon  in their Marry Me promotion in Times Square.  Oh.  What is this?  Surprise live proposals are expected.  Oh, so people are going to propose to each other, um.  I know, Anthony. 
[00:07:30]  Why don't we, uh, why don't we get a guy to, uh, to, uh, propose over the air today?  Hey, that's a great idea.  If you, if you propose to, like, a lady on a radio show, you're a tool.  Yeah.  An effing tool.  Ah.  And it just goes in on the, oh, yeah, it's just, it's the same stuff.  TLJ presenting her own man's dance tonight with Richard Marks.  A romance dance tonight. 
[00:08:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ooh.  Oh, my God.  How do you walk around, like, the Tri-State area and say, yeah, I, I, I'm into PLJ.  They do cool things.  And it's Valentine's Day and they're doing a really cool thing.  Richard Marks.  Last time you heard anything out of him, they were playing that Ugly Kid Joe song on the radio.  Oh, wait a minute.  That was part of eight minutes of pure adrenaline. 
[00:08:30]  It's Ben.  Ben.  Ben set the theme today.  We want to hear from the people that are miserable on this Valentine's Day.  That's what it's all about.  Anthony.  It's a forced holiday.  Anthony, I started the anti-Valentine's Day show, believe it or not, before you.  Before you and I got together.  No, stop.  You know the story I'm going to tell.  And ever since that day, I decided to dedicate a day on the radio to all the miserable F's out there.  Oh, I know this.  Okay.  Now I know the story.  This is a great story.  Oh, it's awful.  It's well documented. 
[00:09:00]  I was sued over it.  I have tape that I still effing can't find, though.  You better dig that up.  I was working at a radio station in Buffalo, New York.  Mm-hmm.  And I was seeing a psychopath.  An absolute psychopath.  Okay.  But the sex was great, so I continued with the relationship.  Okay?  Now it's a woman.  One day, one day this fine slut decided to break up with me. 
[00:09:30]  That's fine.  It happens all the time.  Right, Anthony?  Sure.  I'm sure you could talk about some of the bad breakups you've had.  Well, of course.  Yeah.  I can't think of any, Opie.  Off the top of my head.  Pending litigation.  So we break up.  She says she doesn't want to go out with me anymore, and pretty much she doesn't like me anymore.  Fine.  All right.  That's okay.  You're moving on.  I'm moving on.  Mm-hmm.  So I find someone else to bang.  There you go.  Which is just human nature, as you know.  And I'm starting to bang the new chick. 
[00:10:00]  Having a lot of fun.  But this new chick was in the circle of friends I was hanging with.  Oh, no.  So the ex got wind that I was with this new girl.  Oh, why did you?  Oh, no.  Dive.  Dive.  Why didn't you hook up with a girl that's...  But you're missing the point.  They weren't friends or anything.  It just happened, like, the same bars we were going to on Allen Street there in Buffalo, New York.  For all you people that spent time in Buffalo.  Brr. 
[00:10:30]  I believe it was the Brick Bar.  The Pink Flamingo.  Which actually was a really cool club, so don't abuse me.  Anyway, so, no, you're missing the point, though.  The old, the ex, didn't want me anymore.  Okay.  Didn't want me.  So I'm like, okay.  I was bummed because the sex was good.  All right.  I moved on.  Started banging this new chick.  Okay.  The ex got wind of it.  What does she do?  Is she happy for me and lets me live my life?  Oh, no.  I flew home to New York to actually interview for BAB. 
[00:11:00]  Mm-hmm.  I get back to Buffalo.  There are 15 messages on my machine.  Hmm.  Obviously, she's calling you to say, I made a big mistake.  I want to get back.  No, she did not want to get back to me.  That's key to this story.  Did not.  But she also did not want me to be happy.  That is a fact.  So I get back from my little trip to Long Island to find out I'm moving back home to  do radio down here.  And I got 15 messages on my machine.  Every single message was from this psychopath. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  It starts off.  Did you ever hear this story, Ben?  It starts off with her in her bed just scraping the phone on her Chia pen.  She was playing Guess What's in My Pants before it was fashionable.  Before we even knew what to do with that.  Wow.  So what did she have?  Were you able to tell?  Well, you know what?  You know what?  I got a confession.  That's why I do really well in this game.  Because when you think it's like, you know, a pool rack filled with afro hair, it's usually  like a wood floor.  Wood floor, yeah.  Because I had a lot of practice. 
[00:12:00]  Ah, listening to that tape.  So message after message.  The first few were just a phone.  Whack.  Whack.  Whack.  Then it proceeded.  Maybe a little moaning in the background.  And then a vibrator.  Whoa.  Moaning's nicer and louder, okay?  Around 12 or 13 messages, she's now talking to me going, you hear this?  That's my vibrator.  I'm naked.  And then she's like doing the thing. 
[00:12:30]  Right.  Okay.  So I'm like, wow, this is kind of hot, you know?  Now I'm thinking, wow, maybe she wants to go back out or something.  Right.  All right.  What's important to this story, there was an old boyfriend in the picture.  Yeah.  That she swore she would never go out with again.  The guy was like a coke head, was always, you know, showing up.  But she was always blowing him off, saying, no, I'm not into him anymore.  I'm going out with you.  And I just never really believed it.  Okay.  Let me strap in.  Let me just strap in.  Oh, this is.  I got my seatbelt on.  Hold it.  All right.  All right.  So that's key to the story. 
[00:13:00]  The boyfriend was around, but she said, you know, no, don't worry.  You know, he's got problems, blah, blah, blah.  I will never go out with him again.  I won't sleep with him, blah, blah, blah.  Around the 14th or 15th message, she goes,  After I'm like, holy ass, this girl's just working it.  Going off.  Moaning and scraping on the phone and the vibrator and everything.  All of a sudden she goes, oh, someone's here with me.  Uh-oh.  And all of a sudden she goes, Randy, say hi.  At that moment, my heart just went right out of my body. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, no.  And so Randy says hi.  And then she goes, and he's doing it really good today.  Oh, so he's like slamming her on the phone.  Oh, yeah.  Leaving the message.  Oh, yeah.  This is 15 messages.  But that's how it ended.  That was the grand finale.  There's a clincher for you.  The old boyfriend that was, you know, out of the picture, slamming her.  Oh, no.  And I'm like, what the F?  This girl doesn't want me.  I'm with the new girl.  But she doesn't want me to be happy. 
[00:14:00]  You know what I mean?  Because it was her idea to break up.  So what do you think I did, Anthony?  I was devastated.  I won't lie to you.  I was devastated.  It was brutal to hear.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Ladies, a little tip.  Don't mess with a guy that has a radio show.  Oh, no.  You put him on the air.  I was so pissed.  The next radio show I did, I played every single one of the messages.  15 total.  And you let everybody know who it was. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, yeah.  Not only that.  Not only that, I played it for a mom at work.  And left it on the answer machine of her 80-year-old grandfather.  Grandpa.  That thought.  Here's your little angel.  Oh, that thought this girl was just, yeah, like you said, an angel.  Never did anything wrong.  Because there was a lot of weird crap going on when I was going out with this girl.  And they all looked at me like I was the problem.  When I'm like, no, it's your daughter.  She's a psychopath. 
[00:15:00]  Obviously, you are the problem.  You're sending these sexually explicit tapes to them.  Oof.  Oh.  Well, that's a nasty little breakup.  And obviously, you just can't air tapes like that on the air.  So, I got in big trouble.  But you know what?  I got my revenge.  Yeah.  So, ever since that day, I'm like, you know what?  Valentine's.  Because it was right around Valentine's Day, too.  Within a day or two.  I'm like, got to do the anti-Valentine's Day show for all the other, you know, losers out  there that are effed.  But, oh, to this day, and you know, because I can't find the tape. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, you got to find that somewhere, man.  Because at the worst, we'll put it on the internet or something.  I know it's in one of my radio boxes in a closet somewhere.  I got to just dig it up.  Screw it.  Just play it on the air.  Yeah.  Why not?  It's been about, it's been a while, actually.  About eight years.  Why not?  That's a nasty one.  Ouch.  So, there you have it.  My little, my cute little story.  Hmm.  Opie is a lot more giddier today than usual. 
[00:16:00]  Bill, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Opie, you sound like a schoolgirl today.  Why?  A schoolgirl.  I don't know, man.  I'm just asking you.  You sound...  No, why?  Because I love telling that story.  Yeah.  Because I got the ultimate revenge.  I mean, she broke my heart, but all of Buffalo, you know, got to hear her moaning and acting  like a dirty girl.  And the guy nailing her on the phone.  And the guy nailing her.  That was the worst.  Ouch.  Imagine being an 80-year-old grandfather and having to hear that.  Hey, I haven't heard that in years out of her. 
[00:16:30]  All right, Bill.  Thank you.  Take care.  Bye.  So, there you have it, Anthony.  Hmm.  Well, I'm sure you're not alone, Opie.  No, of course not.  So, there's been many ugly, ugly breakups that end up with similar situations.  John, what's going on?  I'm throwing up over here from that radio crap you guys are talking about.  I want to make this an F you Valentine's Day.  All right.  I just got a job that's going to pay me significantly well. 
[00:17:00]  About two weeks ago, broke up with the girl.  She's not going to see dime one ever.  And it makes me happy.  The only kind of proposal I want is for her to kiss my ass.  Thank you very much for the platform, boys.  All right.  Have a good day.  A lot of people don't really like Valentine's Day.  I mean, you know.  Well, Earl, come on.  Of course not.  You should have saw the Hallmark store.  We all went at lunchtime.  Oh, my God.  What a mess.  Really?  Oh, God.  That's right.  Wait a minute.  Last night. 
[00:17:30]  Anthony, we were laughing because they had everything in there that we talked about.  Yeah.  The braks.  I went into Dwayne Reed.  And the boom, boom.  Dwayne Reed.  The boom, boom heart balloon on a straw.  Dong, dong, dong, dong, dong.  I went into Dwayne Reed and I went down the aisle.  I went down the aisle to get to the refrigerator to find a Snapple.  So on purpose, I walked down the Valentine's aisle.  And there was every guy still like milling around and like not the guys. 
[00:18:00]  They were pretty much the lowest common denominator.  And they're just milling around this ravaged Valentine's section with a big red box with  the cellophane on it of Brax chocolate.  Oh, yeah.  And the bad flowers.  The cards are gone.  There's only like three cards left.  And I started laughing.  Like, oh, my God.  Look at this.  They didn't hear the show.  This isn't it, man.  This ain't it.  Oh, the cards they had left was just pitiful. 
[00:18:30]  They had a lot, though.  They had a lot of bad cards.  I almost had to get a Valentine's Day for my mom and just scratch out words to make it  work for my girlfriend.  Because there's either the really dumb, corny, funny ones left or the heavy romantic ones,  you know, that are kind of gushy.  And you try to pick and choose through those as you're picking up the little stuffed animal  and the red box of chocolates and the Mylar balloon. 
[00:19:00]  It's half deflated or the little one that's the size of a quarter on the stick.  You know, they had the little heart candies with the little sayings on there.  Oh, that's what you need to do.  Be mine.  Be mine.  You know what Opie didn't see behind me?  I was about five people behind him.  The line was huge over at the store.  This one guy walks up behind me.  You could tell he was just, he didn't want to be buying this stupid little beanie baby  love bear thing, whatever he got.  Because he's holding it.  He's in his suit.  He's got his briefcase or his computer, whatever the hell it is. 
[00:19:30]  And he's holding the bear like, so nobody sees it.  Yeah, yeah.  You got to hold it down.  Like, back out by his leg, trying to sneak it up his sleeve a little bit so nobody can  actually see the damn thing.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, because all that stuff at Dwayne Reed is just, it just says crap on it.  What are you doing in that aisle?  What are you doing in that aisle?  It just means I really don't care about you all that much.  I'm convinced if you give Dwayne Reed, like, just a pile of crap, they'll make it look  nice and pretty for Valentine's Day.  They'll pop it up on their shelves.  Oh, yeah, with the bows and stuff. 
[00:20:00]  Right, yeah.  Some paper hearts on the shelves.  Maybe a cute little saying, you know, that goes through it.  A little sign dangling over the aisle, you're Valentine's Day headquarters.  Right.  What?  Are you crapping me?  What are you kidding?  It is just spells.  You're really not that special to me.  Right.  And you know what really sucked?  Me, Opie, and Ben all went at the same time because Opie walks in and goes, do you guys  go yet?  It's like, we all like, oh my God, we got to go.  So we all go down there and I'm the only one of the three in the wife section. 
[00:20:30]  The wife section.  I was the only one there.  Like, everybody else is on the other side of the wall and I'm standing there by myself.  I'm like, oh, I'm the only one on the wife section.  Do I have a hot chick that gives great oral section here?  And like you're in there, you know, you have a girl that gives up every entrance, gives  up the balloon knot card section and you're there, my beloved wife, thank you for just  being there like a big lump of crap. 
[00:21:00]  Oh my God.  All the years that you, there's some guy there going, you have something special for a girl  that could just take it down to the rib cage.  Yeah, we got that over here.  Right over here.  That's funny.  That's funny.  But thank you for cooking and vacuuming.  It's great.  I really appreciate you, even though I don't say it every day of the year. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, those are the worst cards.  Even though I don't say it as much as I maybe should.  Let me get a prick.  It's one day a year he pulls out the card.  I know I should say, this card starts off with an apology.  If your card starts off with an apology, it's over.  It's over, Johnny.  Oh my God.  Do you have the card for the girl that just walks around dripping with the lubricant all  over her backside?  I want to apologize for not saying I love you as much as I should, because quite frankly, 
[00:22:00]  I don't.  And I'm here at CBS, proving that now.  Thank you for cleaning my underwear.  You've dealt with my skid marks.  My God, Valentine's Day.  Give me a break.  My God, man.  Let's go to Al.  Al has a problem.  Al, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  Hey, man.  Anthony, man.  I'm dying here.  I just went to a little go-go joint, one of those all-new joints, and all of a sudden 
[00:22:30]  I'm covered in glitter.  Watch it.  Going home.  Going to have the girl home, but you guys just gave me a great idea.  I got to just now go to the card store, find a card with glitter on it, and I'm all set.  Hey, there you go.  Wow, dude.  You just found the way out.  You found the way out.  If you get a body glitter on you, go to the card store, no matter what day it is.  Get some card with some glitter on it.  And we're all set.  Even if the card that says, you know, I love you just because you're you, not a special 
[00:23:00]  day because you're you.  Even if that doesn't have glitter on it, find a card with glitter, peel it off, and sprinkle  it on the card.  Every now and then you've got to be a sap, but if it gets you out of things.  What a brilliant thing.  You found the answer, Al.  Very.  Wonderful.  Thanks, fellas.  Have a great day.  All right.  See you, Diamond Duff.  Easy.  Do we have any Valentine's Day messages, Anthony?  Rick, I mean.  Oh, yeah.  A Valentine's Day message?  The first batch.  The first batch of Valentine's Day.  Still working on some more.  Ah, nice.  Nice.  All right.  We'll take a break and we'll be back. 
[00:23:30]  All right.  All right.  Happy Valentine's Day, everyone.  Now it's time for messages of love from the Opie and Anthony show.  Happy Valentine's Day.  Yeah, this is Don.  We're going to send a big you to that fat, sweaty piece of lady, Don.  You must be the most annoying ever on the planet.  Please stop calling and clean your smelly you filthy whore.

[00:25:00]  Just send a self-addressed stamped envelope to 888 7th Avenue, New York.  New York.  1-0-1-0-6.  All right?  Mm-hmm.  Wow, we'll be coming back in full force around April, so stick around for that.  That's when it gets really interesting around here.  Ah, yeah.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 is our phone number.  Well, that's been some feedback coming in on this lovely Valentine's Day, Anthony.  Valentine's Day.  Tim from SUNY Oneonta.  Could you send a Valentine's Day shout-out to my true love, my hand? 
[00:25:30]  Ah, there you go.  It never lets me down.  Always in the mood.  It's been a great 21 years with you, baby.  And I look forward to many more.  Nice.  Opie, have you ever taken out one of those little things on Valentine's Day and News Day, the Daily News post?  You know, they have that whole Valentine's section where you get to profess your love for your loved one in the goddamn newspaper. 
[00:26:00]  And know what happens with that?  You see the ad maybe a couple weeks before and you're like, oh, wow, I could be in the paper.  How special would that be?  Yeah.  And you open it up Valentine's Day and you're in there with a thousand other schmucks.  Yeah.  Here you're on the phone with your girlfriend.  No.  No, page three.  Okay.  No, page four.  Page four.  Column eight.  Go to column eight.  Now, see right below the guy that looks like a mongoloid in his picture and the chick that, I don't know, is that her head? 
[00:26:30]  Nice head, Dick.  See, right in between them, that's for you.  That's for you, baby.  That's special.  Look how special it is.  Cost me a whole $20.  No, this one cost me $30 because it's one of those good for one hug coupon cutouts that you can get.  And it expires on the same day.  How about good for one effing BJ?  Right there.  Oh, I can stop talking.  You know what they should do in the paper?  Or if they want people really to read that, they should have a BJ section. 
[00:27:00]  The BJ section.  And instead of these cute little messages on Valentine's Day, it's just a section called the BJ section.  It's only special for Valentine's Day.  And it lists all the guys and where they're from.  And these are the guys that are going to get BJs.  Oh, wow.  So then you're at work with your pals and you'll look down the list to see if you made the list.  And you go, I made it.  I made the cut.  Now that would be cool to read.  I'm in.  All the girls have to do is say, yes, yes, Johnny from Staten Island. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Put him on the BJ list.  Put him on the BJ list.  And it's a guarantee that you're getting a BJ tonight.  How cool would that be?  Love.  Boo-boo Paul.  You are my hero and my miracle come true.  I love you forever.  Happy 9th Valentine together.  Boo-boo Millie.  Yeah.  Anthony, that was a very nice message.  It was very, very, very lovely.  No, you know something? 
[00:28:00]  That's very nice when you're hanging out with each other.  I don't understand putting it in the paper.  I don't get that.  All right.  I've got to go to Bob, who says he has a good story.  Bob, you're next on WNN.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, Bob.  What's up?  Hey, what's going on?  You are not going to believe this.  You are going to call me an effing liar.  I have the best breakup Valentine's Day story in the entire world.  Okay.  I knew this kid.  It was while I was going to school up at UMass Lowell.  And he was my roommate. 
[00:28:30]  He was going out with this girl.  And he broke up with her.  It was a pretty nasty breakup.  So he took an S in a box and sent it to her.  Right?  And then she took an S in the box and sent it back to him.  So now we've got two big logs floating around in this box.  So he threw up in the box, sent it back to her.  She got so pissed off that she sent him a picture of herself giving another guy a Hummer.  Ouch.  So he turns around, writes on the back of the picture, 
[00:29:00]  Hi, Mom and Dad having a great time at school, and sent it to her parents.  That sounds like one of those urban legends.  I saw it with my own drunken eyes.  Well, so has everybody seen the urban legend.  Well, no, no, no, no.  I saw him sign the picture and send it away, man.  I wouldn't give you no urban legend.  Well, that's pretty ballsy if it's true, I'll tell you that.  I swear on my mother's eyes it's true.  Yeah, I was checking an email before the show and someone sent us a picture.  Yeah.  I wonder if it's true.  But basically this guy had his heart broken and stuff, and the girl, I guess it was a 
[00:29:30]  really, really bad breakup.  Yeah.  And he writes how, yeah, you know, I was in love with this girl, and it was a really bad  breakup, and she ended up, I forget exactly, but basically after my best friend, one of  those things, right?  Yeah.  And then he writes, but she forgot that she took these pictures while we were going out.  Ah.  And he shows regular pictures of her and him together, you know, at Disney or at the beach  or whatever.  And then in the middle is a big picture of her completely passed out on the couch with 
[00:30:00]  her chest on the couch, her rump in the air, and you can see it all.  Oh, man.  Oh.  And then this guy's encouraging, you know, to send it to all your friends and family.  Just forward.  Ow.  I would like to believe that's true, but who knows.  Let me go to Eric.  Eric, what's up?  Yellow.  Eric.  Yellow.  I know you're there.  Everyone say hi that's on hold.  Okay, hung up. 
[00:30:30]  Or everyone hang up that's on hold.  No.  Let's go to Tony.  Tony, what's going on?  What's up, Owen A?  Hey.  Oh, man.  A couple of years ago.  I'm that schmuck who thinks it's romantical to get engaged on Valentine's Day.  Anyway, make a long story short, I give her my grandmother's engagement ring.  Worth quite a few grand.  Like I said, make a long story short, we break up.  We have a brawl that night.  Wait, on the same night you got engaged? 
[00:31:00]  The next.  It started that night but rolled over into the next day.  What was the brawl about?  Shut up.  She's just a squacking yak and a pain in the ass.  Then why'd you ask her to marry you?  I was.  I thought I was in love at the time.  Could have been the heroin.  I don't know.  True story, though, dude.  So you broke up the next day and she took...  Takes the engagement ring, chucks it in the sewer.  No.  True story happened in Bayshore, Long Island.  Now it makes perfect sense. 
[00:31:30]  Dude, it took the jaws of life to get my hands off our throats.  I give a big F you out there, you red-headed bottle of factory skankhole.  All right.  Thank you, Tony.  Later.  Love is in the air, Opie.  A lot of anger in the air.  Yes.  Hey, guys.  How you guys doing today?  Hey, Tom.  What's up?  Yeah, my girlfriend, she went last year for a vacation to California.  Uh-huh.  And she said she wanted me to forward out, like, her college applications, the college forms  to try to try for, like, a couple different colleges. 
[00:32:00]  And she wanted me to send a picture in with them.  So, meanwhile, she sent me a picture, the wrong picture.  Instead of a picture of her, she sent me a picture of her doing a guy.  Come on.  No, this is true.  100% true.  You know what I did?  I put the picture in with, made a copy of all of them, put them in with all the applications  and send them to all the colleges.  I sent a picture of her doing a guy to all the colleges.  Yeah, I know.  That's a great story, man.  We get it.  Thank you, Tom. 
[00:32:30]  I don't really believe these.  What?  These stories?  Yeah.  I don't know.  They just seem so brutal.  Pete, what's going on?  How you doing, guys?  Listen, I'm not going to give you some story that you're not going to believe, but I think,  Opie, I think you're a hypocrite.  Why?  Because you're talking about Mr. Anti-Valentine's Day.  You're making fun of the radio station, doing this and that.  But I hear you, Rick and Ben, going down to the damn card store, getting your Valentine's Day card.  Well, we had to cover our bases.  What do you need to cover your bases?  This show is for all the people that are miserable out there.  Exactly.  Oh, I see what you're saying. 
[00:33:00]  So the show is for everyone that's miserable, but when you go home, you're going to go home  with the flowers and the candy and the whole thing, right?  No flowers, no candy this year.  No nothing.  A little something.  A little something.  A little something.  A little something.  Yesterday, you guys are saying that you should treat your women nice all through the year,  get a flower, all that crap.  When was the last time you two guys got flowers for your women?  Pete, are you going out with someone right now?  Yes, I am.  How stupid are you to go home without a car today?  Whether I want to or not, you're stupid if you don't bring a car home. 
[00:33:30]  Why is it stupid if you're the one saying on the radio, I hate Valentine's Day?  Pete, you go home without a car today, and I want you to report back to us tomorrow.  Oh, hey, I'm not the idiot that's saying I hate Valentine's Day.  I'm not stupid like that.  Of course it's stupid, but if you're going on the air saying, hey, what?  Pete, I don't like most holidays.  I think it's a joke.  I agree with you.  But for our listeners, we have decided to make today's show kind of an anti-Valentine's Day show  because it's much more interesting than having people call up and telling the whole tri-state area  who they're in love with.  I agree with you on that, but I'm just saying if you're going to go on the show and make this your show 
[00:34:00]  and you're going to go on the air saying you hate Valentine's Day because some girls...  You know, Pete, you're right.  As soon as I see my girlfriend, I'm going to punch her in the face.  I didn't say punch her.  What the...  Hey, Pete, Pete, I understand...  I'm going to take it the other way.  You know what?  You're right.  I'm going to rip up her car, and I'm going to kick her in the ovaries.  Pete, you're not understanding this.  You know what it is?  What?  Pete, it's like going to the dentist.  We hate going to the dentist, too, but you have to go.  Right.  All right, all right.  Or else your teeth will rot.  But once again, Anthony comes through with a good analogy. 
[00:34:30]  I understand what you're saying.  But Pete, for you, I'm going to take a heart-shaped box, and I'm going to crap in it,  and I'm going to put a nice coat on it, and I'm going to hand it to my lovely girlfriend.  Bracks.  Give her a good shot.  She's not going to be able to tell it's Bracks or my...  There you go.  That's perfect.  All right.  There you go.  Thank you.  All right, let me go listen to myself on the radio.  Bye.  Bye.  You're not going to like what you hear, you effing tool.  You're not going to like what you hear.  You really suck.  That's funny.  See, when you hang up, we get the final word.  All right. 
[00:35:00]  You're not buying these stories, Anthony?  No, I mean, I kind of believe them, but they're just so brutal, you know?  Would you like to take stories from people that are in love?  Yeah, that would be a lot better.  No, I like the brutal stories.  Hell yeah.  You think those radio stations that do love songs at night are really going to be sappy tonight?  Totally.  Yeah, yeah.  Very lovey-dovey.  They'll take the calls and the dedications.  Hi, Chris.  What can I do for you tonight?  Could you play... 
[00:35:30]  Ugh, is this for a very special someone out there in Queens?  Why don't you say hi?  Why don't you say hi?  This is Deliah.  Well, you must love her very much.  Yeah, I'd move.  Could you play the song?  It was the one who played at our wedding.  Could you play Lady in Red?  Play Lady in Red.  Play Lady in Red.  I like that.  Could you play...  What if some of the real lame ones like... 
[00:36:00]  And Chris, do you have a very special message?  You know, I got to tell you, and this is deeply disturbing.  I share way too much on this show.  Sandy was picking me up from the train station.  She puts on the...  I think it's 99.9.  I'll give them a plug.  You know, they do the love songs at night.  Love songs.  Usually, it's like, the girl.  You know, that sounds like she's like, you know...  You know...  Sure.  You know, she really overdoes it.  The voice is really sexy.  Smooth.  Yeah.  Smooth.  And you're like, wow, man, this girl, she must be hot. 
[00:36:30]  You start visualizing.  On the way home the other night, I guess she wasn't on the radio, and the person that was  filling in was a guy.  Eesh.  And he does the same damn thing.  Hey!  Where he lowers his...  It's not as effective.  No.  If you're a guy, you shouldn't be doing the love songs at night show.  It's a sound like a kid touch-up.  Because then it's the guy...  Hi, what do you want to hear?  Right, exactly.  Are you 12?  Are you alone?  You're naked, right? 
[00:37:00]  Okay.  Happy Valentine's Day.  Take that mylar balloon.  Okay, tell me what you like.  About Valentine's Day.  I'll just be right here.  Oh, man.  You're a filthy whore.  But it was a guy, and I was just like, oh, I've got to go shower.  Yeah.  It was just brutal.  Yeah, yeah.  Hi, Ben.  You're calling from Queens?  What do you want to say to that someone special? 
[00:37:30]  Right.  Right.  God damn it.  I listen to Opie and Anthony all day long, and this is the only radio job I could have got.  I've got to talk sexy at night.  Love songs.  And play these goddamn love songs.  Could you play You're the Wind Beneath My Wings for Bob?  Because we've been together for so long.  Shut up.  Love songs. 
[00:38:00]  Nothing but love songs.  On this Valentine's Day, it's muskrat love.  Red muskrat.  Can't look like.  Yeah.  How you doing?  This is Stan.  I want to send muskrat love out to my girl Mary, because she's got an effing muskrat in a lap.  You know, that thing looks like a drowned rat.  And is Mary hot?  Nah, she's an effing slob, but she gives up the balloon knife.  Muskrat love. 
[00:38:30]  You're listening to Love Songs at Nights.  Marissa with the hot voices on vacation, so this is Bruce.  Let's go to the phones, yes?  Yeah, how you doing?  I want to dedicate a song.  Yeah, what's your name, fella?  My name's Pete.  How you doing?  R.I.P.  I want to dedicate this one to Susie.  She's a coke whore I picked up about five years ago.  Yeah, we're broke and destitute now, but she, uh, she can still take it down to the esophagus. 
[00:39:00]  You got to be.  Can I hear, um, could you play this song from Beauty and the Beast?  I love that one.  Uh, sorry about that.  Like I said, the usual girl is on vacation.  I don't know all the buttons here.  Hey, I just like to get this song to J.D. for this thing, because I love it so much.  Hey.  This is Love Songs at Nights.  What are they doing there? 
[00:39:30]  Beauty and the Beast.  What is it you want to hear?  Let's go to the phones.  Love Songs at Nights.  Who do we got on the line?  Hi, hi, this is, uh, Samantha.  How are you?  Hi, Samantha.  Hi.  You got a special someone out there?  No!  I'm looking for someone.  Then why are you calling, bitch?  I want to hear the way we touch by Dan Hill.  The what?  Sometimes when we touch by Dan Hill. 
[00:40:00]  I want to, I want Rick to write better.  Do you touch your naughty spot?  I'm doing that right now.  Rick, you too.  This is Love Songs at Nights.  You ask me if I love you.  Isn't that true?  Come on, my heart.  This is what all the shows will be playing, though.  Oh, I know.  Valentine's. 
[00:40:30]  Who am I to do?  The Valentine's edition of Love Songs at Nights.  Love Songs.  Nothing but love songs.  We're going to play one of the classic love songs.  I'd like to hear something by Celine Dion, who I believe is really, in this day and age,  the master of the love song.  You know, when I hear Celine either singing that lame-ass song from the Titanic or any one  of her other songs, her camel toe looks like the top of a heart from Valentine's Day. 
[00:41:00]  Big, puffy, badge.  Yeah, I think this is, um, this is one of the biggest wedding songs of 1990, whatever the F it was.  What year was that?  I believe it was 1999.  Jeff.  Yeah.  Very, very big.  Shut up! 
[00:41:30]  We have a special, this one's going out to, um, George from, from Liz.  It's from Aladdin.  A whole new world.  Love songs.  Nothing but love songs.  I got this.  I got the next one.  This is Bruce.  It's Love Songs at Nights.  A lot of requests coming in for this one.  Extreme.  More than words.  Yeah.  What the hell happened to my Aladdin? 
[00:42:00]  A lot of songs, Rick.  Mother.  It's still Titanic.  I can't get a thing done here.  What about some Barry Manilow?  I could show you my sea, too.  If there are any single girls out there that want to give me a homer, I'll be off at midnight tonight.  I'll be waiting on the corner. 
[00:42:30]  I can open your eyes.  Later on in the show, we're going to be playing some, uh, Marvin Gaye.  Really gets things going, gets that mood going.  Some Lou Rawls, too.  We got a little, we got a little soul in our Valentine's Day, I'm sure.  Don't just stare at it, eat it.  Let's go to Darren while this song plays in the background.  Darren, uh, what can we do for you today?  You got a Valentine's Day story, Darren, while this...  I got a, I got a very special story for you guys on your anti-Valentine's Day. 
[00:43:00]  All right.  All right.  So about a month ago, my girlfriend comes to me and she says, listen, Darren, I got some  bad news for you.  I missed some pills in my, in my, in my month and I'm pregnant.  Oh.  I said, ouch.  That sounds like a happy time for both of you.  We talked about it.  We made a decision.  I said, look, we'll be responsible.  Let's go to the doctor.  We'll have to get her taken care of because we're too young to do this, right?  Two weeks later, we go, we go make the appointment.  Unbeknownst to us, they say Thursday, February 14th.  Yeah.  Special day.  Yeah.  Special day. 
[00:43:30]  Two days later, she breaks up with me.  She says, I'm, I'm too irresponsible for her.  She doesn't want to, she, uh, her parents hate me.  She can't be with me anymore.  So you know what that bitch is doing today?  He's getting that baby yanked out of her.  So I'd like to say happy Valentine's Day, baby.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bye.  Tell me someone's getting an abortion today on Valentine's Day.  Oh, that is horrible.  Okay, that's a very special abortion. 
[00:44:00]  He'll send us out to that last phone call.  It's a whole new world for him.  He'll go back into the bars and bang all the whores he wants.  Oh, this is a very special dedication coming out. 
[00:44:30]  It's to Anthony.  Is there an Anthony out there that might know this one?  Remember our dance at the wedding.  I love you, Valentine.  It's Amazed by Lone Star.  Every time our eyes meet.  Hey, wait a minute.  There's someone goofing on me.  Rick, you're a tool.  Frank, what's going on?  What's going on, O&A?  Hey, buddy.  Yeah, I got a nice little FQ to send out to my ex-girlfriend.  Yeah.  We started going out about six months ago. 
[00:45:00]  The whole time we were going out, I was trying to get her to eat the peach for me.  Yeah.  With her girlfriend that I want to bang.  Yeah.  So she does.  So she lets me bang her.  This morning, I wake up.  She's gone.  There's a note on my pillow about how can I do that.  Here you go.  Oh, my bad.  All right, I got it.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  How can I do that?  I talked her into it.  But it really wasn't me.  It was the deal that we were drinking last night.  You know what I mean?  So your girlfriend broke up after you guys did the threesome thing?  Yeah.  Nice.  So I want to send a nice little FQ to her and tell her that she's a twat and I hope she 
[00:45:30]  rocks in hell.  Do you have a special love song that you would like to send out to her?  Die, you skanky whore, die.  Die, you skanky whore, die.  That's fabulous.  On love songs tonight.  Love songs.  Nothing but love songs.  Don't worry, Adam from Long Island.  We will be getting to a little Michael Bolton later.  Yes.  Hold on.  Mark, what's going on?  Hey. 
[00:46:00]  Hey.  I sent my girl upstairs to go get her Valentine's Day card.  And she pulled out the wrong little envelope and found naked pictures of my ex.  That was about the end of it.  So would you like to send a song out to her today?  Absolutely.  Enjoy, you slut.  Enjoy.  All right.  Enjoy, you slut.  Enjoy.  On love songs.  Words to live by on this Valentine's Day.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes. 
[00:46:30]  Yes.  Can we start the record?  Because we look like tools.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I love this one.  This is my Valentine.  Don't we have any reverb that we can put on our voice for our love songs, nothing but  love songs program here on the N.E.W.  Your Valentine headquarters.  There it is, O.B.  Wonderful.  I feel like I'm in a large vagina on this Valentine's Day. 
[00:47:00]  I'm still trying to get over the Valentine's Day abortion story.  Don't worry, 14.  You're in there having an abortion.  That's it, doctor.  With a sense of humor.  Let's go to the phones and talk to Cassidy.  Cassidy.  How you doing, guys?  Pretty good.  I'm one of your gay listeners.  I hear you're a gay fellow.  I always and always will be.  Proud to be gay, too.  Do you take it in the blue, not Cassidy? 
[00:47:30]  Pitcher or catcher?  Depends what day of the week it is.  Yeah.  I'm a switch hitter, if you will.  I'll take both ways.  Switch hitter.  He's over.  But me and my significant other, Brian, we were together for two years.  And what we used to do every year was we used to go out to dinner.  He would go to work, come back, and I would meet him at a bar.  He works at, I don't know if you're familiar with Portchef, but he works at a bar down there.  I'll keep his name out of it, but he works at a bar in Portchef.  Major point, sir.  And what we always used to do, we'd meet up, and then we'd, you know, make love. 
[00:48:00]  So I found out that he'd been sneaking around on me, hanging out with another guy.  So what I did was, you know, I didn't say anything about it.  We got intimate.  And what I gave him was a Houdini.  I don't know if you've ever given your girlfriend a Houdini.  The Houdini.  Yes, well, what you do is I'm pleasuring him doggy style.  And I'm making the noises that I'm about to finish, so he thinks that I finished on him.  Howdy!  Faggot?  Faggot?  He turns around.  You're so crap.  He turns around.  Yeah.  And I shoot a nice salt shot right in his eye, and I say, magic. 
[00:48:30]  And that's the Houdini.  He loved it.  Loved it.  Thank you, Cassidy.  Thank you.  All right, bye.  Thank you.  Rick, this song's just goddamn depressing.  It's about something from this century.  Kevin, what's going on?  Yo, what's going on, ONA?  Hey.  Listen, man.  My ex-girlfriend, I broke her with her a month ago.  Yeah.  She tells me that she's pregnant with my kid.  Yeah.  I want to, I, I blew up this morning. 
[00:49:00]  I want, I hope a piano falls on her right now.  All I can.  Do you have a special song you want to send out to her?  Special song?  Uh, yeah, I hope you get cancer of the balloon knot and the peach you effing whore.  That's romantic.  Okay.  All right.  Now, back to you, Rusty.  Kevin, what's your ex-girlfriend's name?  Uh, Megan.  Megan?  Yeah.  Megan, this one's for you.  Love song's a night. 
[00:49:30]  Love song's a night.  Every breath you take.  Look at that whore.  Every breath you take.  Uh, Tom, what's going on?  Eh, eh, eh.  Tom.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Um, I have a special request.  Yeah.  Um, can you play looking in your big brown eye?  Because I'd like to propose to my girlfriend tonight to give me anal.  Oh, you want to do a proposal?  Yes, please.  But instead of the conventional, normal radio on-air proposal, you want to propose that  she give up the anal. 
[00:50:00]  Give up the butt.  Right.  And I know you guys could do it if anybody else could.  All right.  Would you like to call her at work?  Yeah, let's call her at work.  We can do that.  Okay.  Uh, hold on.  We'll get her number.  Okay.  Get, uh, Tom.  That'll be nice.  A little, uh, proposal here on our show.  Tom wants to propose to his girlfriend.  Propose that she gives him, uh, anal.  Very nice.  Yeah.  This is fabulous.

We'll do one more call here, and we'll move on.  Jason?  Yeah, guys, I got the best story of them all. 
[00:55:00]  Yes.  My girlfriend's friend calls me today at work and tells me that my girlfriend's in the hospital.  So I leave work, bum rush back to Queens Parkway Hospital in Florida Hills, and I'm sitting there in the waiting room for about an hour or so, and the doctor comes out.  It turns out two months beforehand, when she went home to Oregon to see her family, she had an abortion and did not tell me.  Uh-oh.  So when did she choose to tell you that she had an abortion? 
[00:55:30]  Oh, the doctor told me.  When?  There was complication today.  Oh!  Today.  Oh!  That's not funny, Danny.  There's something.  So anyway, there was complications or something, and she's...  Hold on, we had to dump out of that, Jason.  Jason, what's her name?  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  What's her name?  Amy.  Amy?  Amy or Annie?  Amy.  This one's for you, Amy. 
[00:56:00]  You're as lovely as you did tonight.  Oh, no.  Oh, that's horrible.  Oh!  Ah!  Never seen so many men ask you if you wanted to dance.  Oh!  Looking for a little romance.  Give it half the time.  I have never seen you drive to me.  Ah!  You're a filthy whore!

[01:03:00]  They get so, like, they get so wrapped up.  Oh, my God.  They're getting divorced.  People get divorced every day, bro.  Who cares?  Who cares?  You know what I mean?  Very good, old Dirty.  You're right.  Because we have to live our lives through others, old Dirty.  That's why.  Yes.  I never did that.  Our lives are so pathetic and mean.  Pathetic.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  Exactly.  Like we got to come in on.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  They're getting divorced.  We're just insignificant.  So we have to look to our stars that we put up on these.  I bet you there's rubes out there sending sympathy cards to. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  Absolutely.  I saw a couple of these women.  Get this.  When I was going in the other morning, Opie to a 30 Rock.  We call a 30 Rock in the business.  The NBC building.  GE building over there, Rockefeller Center.  30 Rock.  I'm walking inside.  Anyway, and these two women come out, obviously guests from the Rosie show, the Rosie O'Donnell  show.  Got done taping and they're coming out with these big shopping bags full of the crap that 
[01:04:00]  they give the rubes in the audience for Rosie.  So now I got to stop.  I kind of move away a little.  I got to watch what they're doing because they put the bags down and start going through  them.  They're pulling out Rosie bibs, Rosie Barbie dolls, a book from a guest that was on the show,  I guess.  And they're thrilled to death.  And you could tell.  I'm just, I'm looking at them going, they're tourists.  And it's so obvious.  Where are the guys with the goddamn bricks when you need them? 
[01:04:30]  The homeless people with the big cobblestones.  Because I would cheer along as he caved in their skulls and got rid of, you know, it's  thinning the herd.  Anthony, they were so thrilled.  Can we tone it down today?  It is Valentine's Day.  I believe we're a bit harsh today.  You think so?  A little abrasive.  A little abrasive for Valentine's Day?  Are we annoying people?  Is that it?  Oh, I think so.  Someone getting upset at the fact that.  Old Dirty's in studio.  Outside the studio, we got Candy Apples.

I mean, has anyone checked her for nads or something?  Oh, my God.  Wow.  She looks like a lady in the name.  Yeah.  We're getting...  She's not tucking it in like at the end of Silence of the Lambs?  No, no. 
[01:16:30]  Everyone's a comedian, right?  She's not tucking it in.  You know, I think he needs to take a little walk to Hollywood.  He's so good.  I think the walk would do him some good.  All right, Joe.  What's going on?  Hey, what's up, Ovi?  Hey.  Stop the stick of shock in it, man.  Get naked or get the hell out.  Our audience, very, very demanding.  Oh, I love them that way.  Well, we want to see, like, the whole body to see, you know,  this new universe.  Yeah.  See what this whole 2000 Award was all about.  I love it when they want to see me naked.  We're the new judges that we want to see right now.  Yeah, right now.  I've got to tell the people at Razzles what it's all about. 
[01:17:00]  That's right.  Yeah.  Josh, what's going on?  I'm watching.  Hey.  Hey, let's tell the script to start getting naked.  I'm sticking here in her talk.  There you go.  You know?  Is he watching?  Tell him that.  Yeah, we got you.  We're watching.  Okay.  You know what it is?  You're not Miss Debating Team 2000.  You know, I'm just being honest.  It's Miss Nude Universe 2000.  That's where your talents lie.  So I guess that's why people are saying what they're saying about this. 
[01:17:30]  That's cool.  You know, you're talking and they're just like, you know, shut up and take your clothes off.  You know how they get.  Are they hanging out the window yet?  Are they looking?  Here.  There you go.  There you go.  Hello, everybody.  Now open up your eyes.  The boob shot again.  The boob shot.  It's the boob shot.  Is that as much as we get?  There it is.  Look at George.  George isn't even happy.  Well, you know what I need.  You know what we need?  We need quarters.  Quarters.  To bounce them off of those things?  You know, you need quarters.  You know, like the little booth down, you know, Times Square.  Oh, peep show.  Like a peep show. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, we give her quarters and, you know, a little more.  You know, the window goes up.  You like the peep shows, George?  I've never been to Times Square.  They cleaned that place up.  That pissed me off.  Mickey Mouse moved in.  Yes.  I went down there with a pocket full of quarters.  I got the Lion King down there.  Now, what the hell am I going to do with these quarters?  You are looking good today.  You used to go to Show World and poke your head in the little booth thing and watch the  girls dance.  Oh, it was beautiful.  You give them a little tip.  You catch a little feel.  That's where I first met.  Oh, dirty.  He's in the booth right next to you, huh?  Yeah.  I wouldn't doubt that. 
[01:18:30]  Hey, Jim, what's going on?  Yeah, dude, ask Miss Nude Universe.  She sucks, yo.  Who's this other guy that you have on with her, though?  This is me, George Wallace.  Yes, sir.  How you doing?  Yo, I've never heard you before.  You have me rolling on the floor right now.  Well, what the hell are you rolling on the floor?  Get your ass out.  People can say some stupid things, right?  A man told me now that my wife is going to die when I tell her I saw you.  Well, what the hell?  Don't tell her.  Just stupid stuff people do.  I'm at the airport.  A lady says to me, I'm standing waiting for my luggage.  She says, Mr. Wallace, you might acquire it today. 
[01:19:00]  I said, well, hell, I'm standing there by myself.  Why do people say stupid stuff?  I'm standing there talking to her.  Are you still rolling in the floor?  You need to get your ass up.  Hey, George has been around forever, Jim.  I've never heard of him, but, dude, he had me rolling when you said he was going to work,  and then he goes, I might show up, I might not.  I had me rolling.  I have to get even for work.  I have to listen to the stadium.  Listen, you have to come to Rascal because when I go on stage, I don't even touch.  But it doesn't bother me.  People are already paid to get in. 
[01:19:30]  Where are you fighting?  He's playing Rascals in West Orange.  I'm there, dude.  You guys rule.  Everybody better be there.  See you later, guys.  All right.  George, have you ever done the Johnny Carson thing?  I've done everything.  I've done you name them.  I did Johnny Carson.  I've been on Oprah.  I've been on Oprah's show.  I've been on it all, you know?  Ouch.  Well, just last week.  I've done every show just politically incorrect last week.  You didn't see me on that?  I was Bill Maher.  No, he missed that one.  Yes, I do every show there is. 
[01:20:00]  Jay Leno, Tonight Show, HBO Special.  You name it, I've been out there.  I do it.  I was even in one of the worst movies of the year.  I was with Little Nicky.  Really?  You were in Little Nicky, huh?  You mind your own business.  Don't be worried about it.  Adam Sandler is a good friend of mine, and I love him.  I'll do it again for him tomorrow.  Well, you know, he had quite a streak going there, so you've got to hit a little bump in  the road every so on.  Sure.  What did you play in Little Nicky?  I was the mayor of the city of New York.  Really?  Yeah, you go see Little Nicky.  Did you see it?  No, I didn't either. 
[01:20:30]  I'll pick Adam Sandler, too.  That one just looked bad.  He's nice.  He's nice.  I'd do anything for Adam.  He's a great guy.  I rented Battlefield Earth before I...  Did you see Batman Forever?  Yeah.  I was in that.  What were you?  I was the mayor.  You were the mayor?  I was mayor of Gotham.  I don't have to lie to you people.  You ain't nobody.  You're right there.  No, no, no, no.  He's absolutely right there.  I just did a movie this year.  It was a successful movie called Three Strikes.  Didn't you see all the advertising with me and Three Strikes?  You didn't know that was me, did you?  Three Strikes.  Oh, hell. 
[01:21:00]  The people in Jersey know.  Wait, no, let's go to John.  John wants to say something to George Wallace.  John, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, we're talking to George Wallace and Candy Apples.  Hey, George, is this George Wallace?  This is...  Hamburger?  Oh, no, that's a friend of mine that says hamburger.  People think that I do that, you know, but I am George Wallace.  I am the George Wallace you're thinking about.  Yes, I am.  Wait, the governor of Alabama?  Yes, I'm the governor of Alabama.  The governor of Alabama.  I'm tired of pussy putting around.  I'm waving my Confederate...  That is pretty odd that, you know, your name was George Wallace. 
[01:21:30]  There's nine George Wallace's in my family, and I'm running for president of the United States.  Are you?  Isn't it great?  Better change the name.  People might get confused.  No, they love me up there.  Let me tell you, everybody in New York knows me.  Isn't it wonderful that President Clinton is going to go up there, though?  In Harlem.  To Harlem, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  There's some good things about that.  Just think, all that stuff he had to take back, like the tables and the purses and things,  they got all that up on the 125th Street.  He can get all that stuff up there.  He can take the top floor.  Jesse Jackson take the bottom floor.  And they put family services right in the middle there.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  It's going to be great for Clinton up in Harlem. 
[01:22:00]  I'm telling you that right now.  He was saying yesterday that back in the 60s, he used to walk around Harlem.  No problem.  Well, you know people say that.  But there's no problem if you go up there now.  There's more white people up there now than you could ever have.  Harlem has completely changed.  I think we all know that.  But in the 60s, he's claiming that he used to walk around.  Yeah, he said, you know, I used to get off the plane and go up to Harlem and just walk around.  People say, hey, what you doing here?  He's fully going, I don't know.  That's pretty good, Bill.  I have my wallet back.  That's pretty good.  It is not that bad up there.  I'm not going to let you get away with that.  No, in the 60s and 60s.  But when we leave here tonight, everybody, you're going to noob. 
[01:22:30]  You're going to take your clothes off and you're going to walk down 125th Street.  No, I didn't.  Show me what you're working with.  No, I'll tell you where it was.  It was on 47th Street and 7th Avenue.  I was nude.  Oh, I knew it was one of those.  On Halloween night.  With the tiara and the whole enchilada.  What the hell did that take to get done?  Obviously, we're not doing it here.  Hey, what can we do to get her to be nude?  I don't know.  I mean, she won a contest in front of thousands of people.  And there's only four of us in here, right?  Yeah, George.  Let me do the talk. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, you've got to work it.  All right, work it.  How you doing?  How you doing?  I feel good all over.  I'm going to say, you show me yours, I'll show you mine.  You promise?  Talk to me.  No, you don't want any talking.  We're doing show and tell now.  Okay, you just...  Oh, candy apples.  Candy, go ahead.  You ever lick a candy apple?  I like candy apples, actually.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  I like her more if she was naked.  Oh, yeah.  You, you, you.  Naked ladies rule.  Would you lick the candy off dapples? 
[01:23:30]  Would you go down to Trenton?  I mean, down to Trenton.  Is that what we're calling it, D.J.?  Going down to Trenton.  That's what the fat lady said, though.  Kiss me where it stinks.  And they drove her to Trenton.  Wow, that was funny.  Come on, you guys.  John, what's up?  Hey, ONA.  Hey.  All right, listen, George Wallace is great, but I can't take listening to her anymore.  Just throw her out.  I don't even want her naked.  Wow, for some reason, the listeners are really getting pissed off. 
[01:24:00]  Here we go.  All right, here we go.  Another boob shot, I think.  You've got a camera thing going.  Well, I'm going to listen to her.  Where are they watching?  She's ruining it for you and George Wallace, I tell you guys.  Oh, wow.  I've got to go hear myself.  Okay, here you go.  He's ready.  Would you like for her to stand up in the chair?  Is that better?  Okay, here we go.  All right.  Get her over there.  Make sure we got this.  Hey, patrol.  Is that getting better for you guys?  Miss Nude Universe 2000?  Hey.  Oh, there we go. 
[01:24:30]  Now we're getting it.  Old Dirty, come on.  Check this out, Old Dirty.  Looks like the last year was a little rough.  Awesome.  There we go.  What did you say?  Nothing.  I thought Miss Nude Universe 2000 looks great.  Here I am.  That's something.  Oh, I'm kicking with gas now.  Old Dirty, would you come back to us, please?  Back to Earth.  Yeah, I'm here, I'm here.  What do you think of Miss Nude Universe 2000, Old Dirty?  She was naked just now.  That's very good, Old Dirty.  Will you be competing?  Next week, we'll work on colors and shapes. 
[01:25:00]  There you go.  Kenny Apples, will you be competing in 2001?  No.  No?  Why not?  The horror.  Is it going to be held on Earth again this year?  Because there's a universe.  So I figured you had the whole field advantage of Earth.  Because if it's universe, you should be out on some other planets, right?  I think it's a little presumptuous to get a gig in Mars.  Wouldn't that be cool?  We could all, like, astral projecting.  Well, I think Miss Universe is a big, that's a lot of area.  Yeah, but the closest you're going to get to Mars is a pack of M&M. 
[01:25:30]  Or maybe a Milky Way or something like that.  But, you know.  Speak up, Old Dirty.  My man, the stage is yours, my brother.  You got to say that.  I just know you do a lot of talking, but today this lady is here and you just got all quiet on us and all like that.  I'm just looking for more.  All right, let's go to Jack.  See what Jack has to say.  Jack, what's up?  Hey, George.  Good morning.  You were the best years ago.  I remember you on, like, the Dean Martin roasts, all of that.  Huh?  Were you on the Dean Martin roasts about three years ago? 
[01:26:00]  Where the hell are you come from?  That's Nipson Russell.  That's Nipson Russell.  With the glove on, the white glove, and the red glove.  That's George, uh, what's that man named?  George, uh.  George, uh.  No, Jefferson?  Not George.  That's Weez's husband, not him.  That was another guy.  Oh, man.  No, I'm George Brothers.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I'm good, though.  You should say I'm one of the newcomers.  Stop, man.  I'm sorry.  I thought you were the talented guy.  What's the guy?  I'm sorry.  He thought I was the talented guy.  Hey, Jack.  You know I know your mama.  Hey, Jack, he's not Nipsy Russell. 
[01:26:30]  No, that was the George guy that did what he's talking about with the gloves.  I can't think of the name either.  Yeah, it was a good guy.  It was a good guy, too.  He died some year.  He was locked up for doing drugs in Las Vegas before he died a few years ago.  Hey, that's funny.  Yeah.  He was locked up for selling drugs.  Is that better?  Danny, there you go.  Danny, what's up?  What's up, guys?  How you doing today?  All right.  We're hanging with George Wallace, who's playing Rascals in West Orange.  George is funny as hell.  Thank you so much.  I just want to know, since when did he start doing stand-up with the Andrew Dice Clay with 
[01:27:00]  Fun Bags?  Well, Andrew Dice Clay was there last week.  Andrew Dice with Fun Bags.  She keeps plugging, but doesn't show anything.  No, she showed her body.  Yeah.  She did.  Oh, beautiful.  Yeah, Candy Apple showed her body.  I can't wait.  Showed the monkey.  She showed the chalupa, too?  No, she didn't show the chalupa.  Showed the monkey.  Hey, George, keep talking to her.  Before you know it, she'll show you the chalupa.  That's what I'm looking for.  Oh, I'm trying to tell you right now.  Oh, I wish that wasn't Oscar my winner. 
[01:27:30]  You guys.  Hey, man, what's up?  Yo, what's up, boys?  Come on, come on.  Hey, is she still naked over there?  No.  Because my radio was starting to smell a little fishy.  I was going to tell her to put her clothes back on.  Oh, wow.  She's quiet now.  Hey, George.  You got a real good radio, too.  George.  Yes, sir.  Did you used to do that bit with, that's the way I like it?  You'd hold up the sign?  Yeah, I did.  That's the way I did.  That's a funny bit.  Wow, yeah.  They went way back.  They got someone right in the bit.  No, I didn't do it.  I just told him that.  Oh, is that it?  I don't take credit for it.  What the hell, man? 
[01:28:00]  Well, I did so much stuff.  I'm so topical that it changes every year.  You know, right now I'm talking about just being here in New York, talking about things that  just happened last weekend, today, and Valentine's Day.  I'm topical, so I change every day.  You can watch my show.  It's always different.  What do you got on Valentine's Day, George?  I have absolutely nothing on Valentine's Day.  I just make up stuff.  You know, I make it sound good, but I guarantee you by this weekend I'll have something.  You'll figure it out, right?  I just talk about things that happen in the city and things that happen.  You know, you just lie.  All right.  What have you seen in the city since you've been walking around?  Well, it's just kind of stupid how the people drive.  Well, you want to talk about something stupid? 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  The way people drive.  Say, I'm from another part of the country.  We can make a right turn on red.  Right.  But you can't do that in New York City.  Right.  Because, you know, you can't let people make right turns on red.  You already got people going straight on red.  So I'm on the George Washington Bridge.  A man in front of me changed lanes from the upper level to the lower level.  That's a lane change.  And didn't even signal.  Well, these jokes sound, you know, you know, they have to be out of the state.  It's amazing that you hit me with jokes, and I do jokes all the time, and I can't even  think of a joke you do right now.  Isn't that amazing?  That's your job, man. 
[01:29:00]  It is my job, isn't it?  Yeah.  How about a topical joke?  Well, a topical joke would be talking about people that need their ass kicked.  Ass kicked?  That's topical?  A lot of people need their ass kicked.  Yeah?  You ever go to a grocery store and somebody pay for a loaf of bread with a check holding  up the whole line?  Oh, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah.  They need their ass kicked.  They'll have to call the general manager over to approve the check, right?  Hell, I can approve $1.29.  Get the hell out of the way.  I say, well, a lot of people need their ass kicked.  You ever go to somebody's house, the dog is snipping your crotch, and they won't do  nothing about it?  These people need their ass kicked.  The doctor, you ever go to the doctor, the doctor needs his ass kicked.  You ever go to the doctor, you sit there for, you know, you've got a 10 o'clock 
[01:29:30]  appointment, you don't see him, they're 11.30, 11.45.  You've got to meet the weatherman needs his ass kicked.  You ever see the weatherman come on every day, you know, chances are, you know, always  chances are and things like that.  It's stupid.  You go to school to teach, ask you how much is 3 plus 4, you can't go nearly 7 with a  20% chance of being 8 and maybe 9 in the low-lying areas.  The weatherman needs his ass kicked.  You've got to go on and on and on.  People need their ass kicked.  All right, there you go.  Hey, do you do the hurricane name bit? 
[01:30:00]  What hurricane?  Names for hurricanes.  I did that one time, too.  When you're about to X nickname, they don't have a hurricane door and stuff like that.  Now, that's a wreck for you when it comes to town.  Right.  But I forget more than I do.  That's a funny bit, though.  I do.  How the name of the hurricanes are all, you know, lame names.  Hurricane Leroy, things like that coming up.  You know there's going to be a lot of stuff missing like that.  I got a question for you guys.  Yeah.  Because I was on radio the other morning.  We were talking about, are there any trailer homes in Manhattan in the boroughs, the five  boroughs of New York City? 
[01:30:30]  No, not that I've seen.  No, we have projects out here.  So you can't have a hurricane up here, like, you know, because, you know, the hurricanes  only go where they're trailer parks, right?  No, you can have a hurricane.  But you can have a tornado.  A tornado.  What's the difference between a tornado and a hurricane?  A tornado is over the land.  One blows and one slips.  Over the land.  Over that.  One's wet and one's dry.  Ooh.  She's coming alive now.  The hurricane's wet.  If he was naked, I would have laughed at that.  I hear the wind blowing.  So come on.  Will you go by? 
[01:31:00]  There I go.  Somebody's going to get naked up in here before we go.  All right.  Let's go to Frank.  Frank, what's going on?  We're hanging with Candy Apples and George Wiles playing wrestling in West Orange.  George, what's going on, buddy?  I feel good all over.  I hope you're coming to George.  Everybody's talking.  Listen, listen.  Listen, I got a question, man.  My grill is broken.  How do I return it?  No, that's not George Foreman.  I'm trying to cook damn ribs and my grill is broken.  I'm like, good George is not opening ass.  Let me call him up.  He's like a return of damn thing.  He needs his ass kicked, too, for setting those things.  You know, a long pole pillow.  If he comes out with one more thing, set it and forget it. 
[01:31:30]  I need to put his ass in there and set it and forget it.  I'm tired of these talk shows.  What do you call these cooking shows?  I did one of those last week, too.  I did the guy.  What's the black guy's name with the black guy?  Harry and Ainsley.  What's his name?  Oh, his first name, not Harry?  Harry and Ainsley.  Well, it ought to be.  No.  So, he's doing the show.  And then I got the old ladies on there.  He's got Emerald.  Bam.  And I did the old lady that needs to retire.  You, your child.  I do.  You can't even lift up me anymore.  You ever see her just leaning on her?  You guys, oh, the chicken.  You get the chicken. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, my goodness.  And don't eat the, you know, and drooling all over the food.  You should say, watch on TV.  We've seen her.  She's quadimoto now.  She's got a hunchback.  That's not nice.  Don't say, don't talk about the hump in her back.  She's got a hunchback.  I saw the hump, but did I mention the hump?  I don't know what it is.  She's kind of like Quasimodo, bent over sideways.  And the chicken is just a beautiful picture of the chicken.  The hump is too bad, but the drooling is fine, George. 
[01:32:30]  I didn't know where the line was here.  She's mixing the sauce with her boobs at this point.  Because they certainly reach over in there.  I can take it away.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is too much fun.  I'm telling you, I'm having a good time.  Man, let's go to Bill.  Bill, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, Bill.  I had seen George Walton on some game shows.  Weren't you on, like, Hollywood Squares or something?  Oh, you know, I'm so stupid.  I'm a regular on Hollywood Squares.  You guys here looking at me and I didn't even see it.  Like a long time ago, back with the other guy.  No, hell no.  I'm on the new Hollywood Squares.  How old were you when your mind just got up and walked away from you? 
[01:33:00]  What's your name, Frank?  I could have been your daddy, but your mama didn't have change.  One quick, what did I learn?  I learned Candy Apples had a heart for you.  She had a heart.  Thank you, Bill.  I don't know.  His phone is crapping out.  Thank God.  He's self-editing.  Bill, she's sitting right here.  Oh, Bill.  She's right here in front of us.  Oh, boy.  It's a beautiful day.  Candy Apples, you all right? 
[01:33:30]  Oh, I'm doing fine.  Just hanging.  Okay, very good.  You got nice eyes, though.  Let me peep them.  There, you got nice eyes.  Thank you, so do you.  Thanks.  All right, let me...  Hold on.  There is a trailer park in New York, guys.  Danny, what's up?  Hello.  Danny, turn on your radio.  That's a delay.  Let's go.  It's down.  I'm sorry.  Go.  Yeah, New York City has one trailer park.  It's in Staten Island.  That is bull.  I control it.  Really?  Yeah.  That's amazing. 
[01:34:00]  I control it.  He's like the Gotti of the trailer park.  I control it.  That's my territory.  He's a trailer park ranger.  He said, control it, control it, not control it, control it.  He's a ranger.  Oh, okay.  He's one of those guys out there that really think he's important.  You know, some people think they're important.  You ever see the security guard riding at the mall, the security guard in the car?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  If he's got that little yellow light on, oh, hell, he wants to write your ticket so bad.  Some people really think their job is important.  And he got his head down.  He got his head down.  Yeah.  He's walking around and he's all tight. 
[01:34:30]  Those are rent-a-cops, right?  Yeah.  You know, let's think they're really important.  They're really important.  They're really good.  Janice at the school.  Just because he's got all those keys.  He owns that damn school.  You know that?  He's got the master keys.  And the person out in the crosswalk person, the usually little lady with that stop sign.  Oh, that's her corner.  You can't tell her anything better than that.  You can't even go.  You stop right now.  A lot of people think their job is more important than they are.  Take your clothes off.  Candy Apples.  You're not laughing at the comedic stylings of George Wallace.  He's brilliant.  She's amazing.  He's just looking at me. 
[01:35:00]  I'm just having fun here.  No, when you're with a great bunch of people, all you can do is have fun.  I have the best job in the world.  Just have F-O-N.  Hang on and have fun.  Let's go to Georgette.  Georgette, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  All right.  Bonjour.  Hey, George.  I remember you as a kid, about like maybe 10 years old, and you did this bit about Burger  King, making burgers the way you like it.  Oh, have it your way.  When you were about 10 years old, sometimes you've got to break the rules.  That used to be my bit.  Sometimes you've got to break the rules.  You know, I used to walk in and say, how about throwing a couple extra waffles on there?  Sometimes you've got to break the rules.  That was funny then. 
[01:35:30]  So I do commercials.  I just pay attention to everything in life, like the new commercial, An Army of One.  Right.  Now, what the hell is up with that in Army of One?  I've heard that one.  On the AWOL, you've got to go look for yourself.  Oh, you've got to wake up in the morning, you've got to blow your own bugle?  You know what I'm talking about.  I mean, An Army of One, huh?  Don't ask.  You're gay.  You can't ask.  You can't tell anybody either, you know?  Yeah.  It's amazing.  You get mail, you've got to call out your own name.  Wallace.

She hasn't said anything in 10 minutes, and everyone's still giving her grief today.  I think what we were wondering was, was there a personality person to our contest?  Yeah.  Was there some type of personality?  Like, you know, Miss America, they have, you come out and read a poem to tell you what you're in world peace or something,  and then you come out and be a negligee.  Or a talent portion or something?  Just a little talent portion.  What did you do for the talent portion?  Courage presence.  Beauty queen image.  Beauty queen image.

[01:45:00]  All right.  You shut up.  All right.  We'll be back.  Want to be on TV?  Join Opie and Anthony this Thursday at that WWF restaurant at 43rd and Broadway.  They'll be taping their next XFL free game show.  Doors open at 5.  Now, look at this.  Lexus back advertising with the radio program.  Opie, are we talking about the IS-300 that I effed up a couple months back?  You know, you had the IS-300 for quite a while. 
[01:45:30]  What'd he do?  He enjoyed the hell out of it.  Opie, Lexus, gave him an IS-300 to drive around for, like, how long?  Close to two months.  Close to two months.  And he had 200,000 miles on it.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, we told all the stories.  He was doing donuts in the parking lot and in the snow.  And this is a nice car.  I know.  And, you know, they give us these cars you're only supposed to do, like, 6,000 miles in  a half a year.  He does 200,000 a month.  Oh, it's insane.  So, he's driving around.  And I got to admit, I felt a little jealous. 
[01:46:00]  Felt a little jealous.  That Opie's cruising around.  Well, guess what I got yesterday from Lexus?  An IS-300 of my own.  Give him a big hand.  There you go.  I have parked the SUV.  And I am now driving the IS-300.  I got to tell you, what a difference.  You know what I mean?  I am stupefied.  I'm having a great time with this car. 
[01:46:30]  It's a great car.  It is so, I got to say, it's so fast.  I told you.  It's so quick off the line.  Careful, shmearful.  I am flying on this thing.  Well, they make a good product, that's for sure.  People that I used to have to get around using a little bit of bulk and muscle in the SUV,  now I can...  I'm speeding around.  Last night, one side highway, on the way home, I thought it was 24 hours of Sebring.  I was getting like that whole thing going on.  I'm in between the car. 
[01:47:00]  The handling on this thing, too.  Amazing.  Outrageous.  Turns that I used to have to go around on the brake, I'm on the gas.  There you go.  There you go.  Out-handles, out-performs the BMW 330i.  It is unbelievable.  Shifting.  You don't have to take your hands off the wheels.  E-shift is amazing.  E-shift.  I love it.  Traction control.  The cockpit.  And George, what do you drive?  Is unbelievable.  I'm a big guy.  I drive a black car.  Just a black car?  Well, I drive a...  I drive a Mercedes. 
[01:47:30]  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Look at George.  Look at George.  I work.  I work a lot.  You know, I'm in Las Vegas.  I'm all over the world.  I work a lot.  I work a lot.  Don't I ever met you before?  I haven't seen you before.  We've met someone before, have we not?  Where?  I don't know, but I know you.  How do you know me?  I know you from somewhere.  I met you somewhere.  We've worked together somewhere before, without a doubt.  I know that face.  Uh-oh.  Interesting.  Where's the joke?  There's no joke.  There's no joke?  No. 
[01:48:00]  Do you have Alzheimer's?  I did take a ginkgo bowler.  What's the name of that thing you take before you go?  Ginkgo.  Ginkgo.  I forgot what it was.  I don't know what it was.  Ebola?  Ginkgo Ebola.  You got Ebola?  That's Ginkgo line.  Ginkgo Ebola.  That's different.  Ginkgo line.  All right.  Anthony, yeah, the IS300.  Yeah, I love it.  The cockpit, very driver-friendly.  And illuminated.  I have got this thing hooked up for me.  And I love it.  And it's a beautiful car. 
[01:48:30]  You know something, O?  The color that I got, nicer than yours.  I got to say it.  I hope you got the silver one.  Yeah, but the key?  Yeah.  Mike, when I had the IS300, by the time I gave it back, it was the exact same color of the car you're trying right now.  Yeah, well, that's the truth, too.  I got the graphite.  Oh, did you get the graphite?  That's pretty.  Yeah, I know, man.  Metallic gray.  With the beige leather?  Really nice, yeah.  Mine was light and turned out like it, but I gave it back. 
[01:49:00]  That's a true story.  Well, I love it.  I love it, too.  The performance is there.  The looks, the styling, the interior.  It's got it all.  The IS300 from Lexus.  Thank you, Anthony.  That is it.  Boobs.  The world's universal language.  Opie and Anthony, your linguistic experts.  Whip them out Wednesday.  M-E-W. 
[01:49:30]  What a crew we have in here today.  Old Dirty, Candy Apples.  Yes, yes, yes.  And the great George Wallace.  Thank you so much, Opie.  No one knows what you did on TV, but we all know you're famous for something.  I've done so much, man.  A lot of people are so confused as to who you are.  That's why the phones are ringing up at Rascals right now.  A lot of people saying, I loved you, as Rerun.  Yo, you were Rerun.  You know, Anthony, I'm only going to hit you one time.  Anthony, Anthony, Anthony, you're making this stuff up over there. 
[01:50:00]  I see you writing it down.  I'll tell you.  I'm confused.  You're writing this stuff.  I can't even talk, you know.  I can't even talk.  You're making me sick, man.  All right, let me go to Frank.  Frank, what's going on?  Hello.  Hey, Frank, you're on the radio.  Let's go.  Hey, listen.  This guy, I've been a fan since I'm a kid.  Nice.  And he do his famous signature line, Dino Mate.  No, he's too fat to be the sign of my guy. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, now he's calling me fat.  How come on the show?  I'm being insulted here.  So he put on weight since good times went off the air?  All I'm saying is that you're a little fatter than Jimmy Walker.  Yeah, I'm just a little bit.  I'm a little bigger than him.  I'm more buff.  You guys can make the number ten.  Hey, is he bigger than the rolls of fat on Estorol, Florida's neck?  Oh, the back of your neck?  He looks like a package of hot dogs.  Well, how about your mama?  Your mama's so fat the lips out of her ass has a different area of code.  I hear your mama's so fat. 
[01:51:00]  Hey, Anthony, stack or two, the world's strongest fat burner.  Hey, you want to lose some weight?  Hmm.  Maybe you're a little chunky.  You want to drop a couple of pounds?  Stack or two, the world's strongest fat burner.  It does work.  It does three things.  It burns the fat.  It cuts down on those cravings to snack during the day.  And it gives you a boost of energy.  So if you're petering out, you didn't take your ginkgo Ebola,  and you're petering out at the end of the day.  You pop a stack or two, and you have the energy to finish up the day.  You know, I've got to say something.  What? 
[01:51:30]  How weird are we that we had Miss Nude Universe 2000  and George Wallace in the studio at the same time,  and we told Miss Nude Universe 2000 to go home?  That's weird, isn't it?  That's weird.  I must be really good.  We wanted to hang with George Wallace.  I must be really good at you.  Yo, over here.  Oh, D?  Yo, yo, yo, yo.  Oh, dirty.  We're walking to, like, the back wall and talking.  Put your headphones on, son.  You sound like fog on leg.  No, no, no, no, no.  I say, I say, boy, I put the headphones on. 
[01:52:00]  Boy, it's about as sharp as a sack of wet mice.  It's all about it.  See, you're having nothing but fun.  Is this the greatest job in the world?  It certainly is.  It's different every day.  It's different.  All right, go ahead.  Stack or two.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Well, what else do you want me to tell you?  It burns the fat.  It turns your cranes to snack and gives you a boost of energy, right?  Yeah, so if you're fat, you want to lose 10 pounds or 100 pounds.  Stack or two.  Why do you look at me when you say that?  Oh, my God.  I didn't mean that.  I was just looking over.  You're insinuating that I'm fat.  Don't look at me when you say that.  Not at all.  You don't do this commercial every day at this time. 
[01:52:30]  No, I just happen to look over that way.  Your time?  Your time to do stack or two.  After all the fat jokes, we...  It is the world's strongest fat burner.  Log on to stack or two, the world's strongest fat burner, at stacker2.com, stacker2.com,  or call them up 1-800-LITELINE, 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E.

[01:53:00]  Are you matching me naked?  Overload.  Pleasure overload.  Oh, it just makes me tangle.  Look at us hanging out with George Wallace, Anthony.  You should be so lucky.  We are lucky.  I know that's it.  I'm lucky to be here, too.  I feel good all over.  You beat out Miss Newt Universe 2000?  I can't believe that, man.  She's...  I'm still here.  She's gone.  That should be very telling right there.  Let me tell you something.  We're like, all right, George Wallace will come in.  He'll do a couple jokes. 
[01:53:30]  Then we can focus on what we really want to do.  Miss Newt Universe 2000.  And...  I'll tell you something.  I'm going down to see Miss Newt.  I'll talk to these two buttheads, and I'll get the hell out of here.  Now we're here all friends together.  You never know what's going to happen.  That's right.  That's it.  Hey, you want to meet Stalker Patty?  Who?  This girl stalks us.  She's outside the studio right now.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  So she's here?  Yeah.  She has a stalker that...  We have lots of stalkers, but we figure we should keep them close instead of having  them lurking around the corners and stuff. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  This girl stalks us.  This is Stalker Patty.  No joke.  No joke.  Look at her.  She's 55 and a virgin, George.  I'm not 55.  55.  Oh, I'm sorry.  45.  Is she a virgin?  You're a virgin?  Hi.  Hi.  How are you?  Oh, it's so good to meet you.  Me too.  Yeah.  But I met you out there.  Don't tell the people.  They don't know.  She's, what, 45?  Yes.  45.  Yeah.  Look at her.  And a virgin.  Like a virgin. 
[01:54:30]  Patty.  Oh, pregnant.  Patty, are you putting on some pounds?  No.  Are you pregnant?  No?  She might be concealing.  Did we pat her down?  No.  What do you got there in the bunt region?  Wow, yeah.  You got a little bunt happening.  What's going on?  Is it the pants?  Makes it look like you got a bunt.  Did you go to the grocery store to get dinner?  What's going on in front of your pants?  What happened there?  Very funny.  Or is it the hair growing back from your waxing?  I like the outfit.  It's very Kiki D.  Kiki?  Who's Kiki D? 
[01:55:00]  Who the hell is a designer?  Don't worry about it.  It's a designer, Kiki D.  It's very 1982.  No, that's like 1976.  Didn't you ever see the video of Elton John and Kiki D?  You bought them at Pierruches.  Remember the store, Pierruches?  I think you're very beautiful.  I don't care what they say.  You know, these guys are really, yeah.  No, it's wild.  I think you washed your hair.  I washed my hair every night.  Yeah, what's going on?  Because you did something to it.  Now it's a little poofy.  It's a little poofier.  Usually it's a stringy. 
[01:55:30]  Stringy and greasy.  Now you've got some kind of body volume going.  He's using a new conditioner now.  Ah, new conditioner.  What's his name?  New conditioner and a comb.  Very nice, yes.  A comb.  So, Patty, you love these guys?  Of course I do.  Which one would you like to marry?  Which one would you like to take home?  Which one would you like to rock their world?  Shut up.  Would you like to rock Old Dirty's world?  Hell no.  I'll put them on the street, my brother.  Wow, Old Dirty turning down a woman.  Wow.  That was. 
[01:56:00]  Not even horny goldweed will get me any of that, my brother.  All right, Patty, what did you bring us today?  She makes no money, George.  I decided to wish you a very happy Valentine's Day.  Patty, you're going to wish us?  Oh, no.  See, this is the box of brats.  Opie, you'll love your bean baby.  I picked it out just for you.  Perfect type guest. 
[01:56:30]  Elmer Candy Vision.  Beanie Babies, that's so 1998.  1027.  And on the eighth day, God said, let there be breath.  Boom.  Boom.  Wow.  W-N-E-W.  Yes.  It is Whip-A-M-O Wednesday.

New York.  101.  101.  OD.  Yes, sir.  When you were working at Eastern Airlines doing security, being a security guard on board  the 747s at night, did you ever try to steal the autopilot and put it in your hoopsie?  I'm wondering.  That would be a...  Oh, look at this.  Yo, someone wants to know if you put the planes on block. 
[01:57:30]  Up on block.  The pilots come out the next day, the planes are up on block.  Seats are ripped out.  You can get some mad cash for those wheels, yo.  Nah, I took all the peanuts, kid.  What?  No peanuts.  We cleaned out the gollies.  All right.  I thought I saw a 747 sitting on the side of the cross island one day.  All stripped.  Wingless.  No wings.  With no wings on it.  Stripped like the termites got to it.  You know what I'm saying? 
[01:58:00]  Anthony, it's time to play What Did We Learn on the ONA Show.  Wow, we only have a few minutes left here.  Dan from Hoboken.  The man.  I think every day we've got to start with Dan from Hoboken.  Just like when they do those president press conferences and that old hag in the red dress  gets to do the first one.  The first question.  The first question, yeah.  I think we're going to give Dan from Hoboken that honor every day.  Mm-hmm.  Dan from Hoboken.  I learned Gary Ackerman isn't the only politician to appear on the ONA Show.  Now they've got George Wallace. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  You know, I've got to read this.  Reverting back to the beginning of the show.  Okay.  Tuttle from New York.  I learned Lady in Red was about a girl and her abortion.  Ouch.  That was cringe radio at its best.  O'Day is trying to placate to those listeners who only understand ebonics.  And even, oh, I learned even Stalker Patty in a thong couldn't placate O'Day's libido  after all the horny goat weed.  There you go.  Anthony from West Orange.  I learned Miss Nude Universe is from Bizarro World. 
[01:59:00]  Boy, was she a wrinkled mess of what, kid?  I mean, she was a beautiful older woman, and I wouldn't mind taking her to the AARP dance.  Boy, come on, man.  Is she really the 2000-ness Nicky Jacob?  Well, like I said earlier, though, it must have been a rough year.  If that was 2001?  I don't think.  I don't know.  That's a rough year.  Look at the...  It was good in that car, right?  No. 
[01:59:30]  No?  Let me see.  I think she looks good in her little advertisement.  Sure, why not?  This is everything I just don't like in a woman.  It's right here.  Let me see.  What, the big fake boobies and...  She has everything.  Oh, well, yeah.  That's correct.  No, I like that.  Like a man.  I like that.  You know why?  Why?  Because it doesn't talk.  Well, yeah, that was something when she opened her yap.  Anthony.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, I learned that F.O.N. is fun.  Yeah, F.O.N. fun.  What do you get about?  Yeah, communication on the ground, boys. 
[02:00:00]  All right, thank you.  Yeah, I mean, George Wallace is killed today.  He was funny.  He was playing Rascals in West Orange all weekend.  Brian from Jersey, Anthony.  Today I learned that if you take all women and put them in a blender, you'll have the  purest form of concentrated evil.  Johnny Mac from Jersey.  I learned that dice is like a crock pot.  It takes them eight hours to say something funny.  I told you guys I get on the air.  This is Bill from Tom's River.  I got on the air.  I learned that he's going to make Stalky Patty's curdled milk flow tonight. 
[02:00:30]  Oh.  They always equals disgusting.  Dale from Jersey.  Hey, guys, make sure you don't tell dice that you got the cake.  Hold on.  That's a good one.  Brendan.  Brendan, excuse me, from Poughkeepsie, New York.  I learned today that George Wallace is off the hook, yo, and that the Salvation Army sells thongs.  No, I'm not banging Stalker Patty after the show. 
[02:01:00]  I learned today that on Valentine's Day, radio DJs sound like kid touchers.  I learned Patty has worse pants than Lady Di.  It's a close one.  Lou, what's going on?  Hey, what up, ONA?  Hey.  Oh, dude, it's all okay?  Be my little logo.  He can't.  You sound it?  Yo.  You sound it?  Yeah.  You kill me when you do that airline pilot voice, man.  Anyway, today I learned, thanks to Stalker Patty, Cisco has shot himself. 
[02:01:30]  Later, boys.  All right, bro.  Peace, baby.  I think we got to get out of here.  Yo, I got my plugs, man.  Yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck.  She got a butt.  Butt, butt.  I don't want to see it again.  Yeah, I thought we were going to work that, bro.  Yeah, right?  You got everything?  We got feeling it.  Yeah, yo.  We got the napster.  We can work it.  That was good.  Hey, I want to remind everyone that the Olsen Twins is on E tonight.  Olsen Twins special.  What is it? 
[02:02:00]  Like a true Hollywood story type thing?  I believe so.  A celebrity profile.  One of those things, right?  And then they were touched by a New York DJ.  It better not be a behind the music.  Have you ever found yourself doing this?  Or has it jumped me?  True whacking story on E.  Have you found yourself doing this in the back office?  Because I did it.  It's the most embarrassing effing thing.  I'll be sitting in a chair.  Someone will come in, talk in another one of those meetings.  We just don't pay attention to. 
[02:02:30]  And my eyes, I'm scanning the office.  I go around.  And I find I'm just staring at the Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen poster.  And someone will look at me staring at the poster.  I'm like, why?  Why?  I wasn't looking.  I swear.  I'm not looking.  The one on the right.  Oh, wow.  That, my brother, is a sneak preview.  The one on the right.  I think it's Ashley, because Mary-Kate and Ashley, if you go from left to right, it's  like our picture's Opie.  You've got to be on the left.  I've got to be on the right. 
[02:03:00]  Or lest they be confused, it's Opie and Anthony.  So when I'm looking, I look at that Ashley Olsen.  I'm like, that is the whore.  She's got Mary-Kate is the girl next door one.  She's kind of got her hair in this little headband-type thing.  It's a little shorter.  A little shorter hair.  And she's standing there kind of awkward.  And her legs totally together, standing straight up.  Ashley.  Ashley.  She's got her hip cocked out a bit.  Hair's a little longer. 
[02:03:30]  Her hair's longer.  She's got this F-me look on her face.  Am I going too far here?  And everyone I ask.  Wow, look at the time.  We've got to go.  Everyone I've asked.  It comes in there and I've asked them all.  I say, which one is the goer?  And they say, the one on the right.  And I say, yes.  She is the whore.  What if you don't like a little...  Why are you all looking at me like that?  I just thought we were all having fun. 
[02:04:00]  What happened?  You know the good news, too?  That poster was made at least three or four months ago.  So they're even older now.  Forget about it.  They've aged under three years right now.  We're two years in our month, I think.  And you know what's even more embarrassing?  When we catch Anthony scratching at one of them.  Scratch and sniff?  Oh, dare to dream, O.D.  Dare to dream, scratch and sniff.  All right, why don't we get out of here?  Wait, my plug.  Oh, yeah.  I'm all dirty.  I forgot.  O.D.  Yo, big up to my brother Miguel.  Big slow.  My man.  Hey, when are we going to be doing the O.D.O. again? 
[02:04:30]  Yo, what's up, man?  You're going to give my man Gay Marco some time.  Yeah, Marco is doing his little radio show tomorrow.  15, 20 minutes of nothing but Gay Marco.  I'm definitely going to listen to it.  But you got your own thing.  The O.D.O.  Come back with an O.D.O.  I want to recapture the magic for 2K1, my brother.  And I'm going to get it.  It's Old Dirty's observation.  Yeah.  Right.  The O.D.O.  All right.  You write one for next week.  Sounds good.  All right.  And I want to give big ups to my man Orlando. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, you got a new boy with you.  Yeah, that's my minister of information.  What happened to P.R.?  He wasn't...  P.R.?  No, P.R. is still in there.  But I moved him up.  I gave him another strike.  All right, right on.  He's good to go.  And I'll be at the bodega.  Wait, who is this Orlando guy?  He's going to be at the bodega.  Who, Orlando?  Yeah.  Yeah, he gets the herb and all that.  He's got the...  He secures all of that.  Here's my man right here.  All right, relax with that.  All right, all right.  And what's your plug?  I'll be at the bodega from 8 to 12.  Yeah?  So try to catch me early.  It's kind of rainy outside.  All right.  Wear your Gore-Tex.  All right.  Peace.  Peace. 
[02:05:30]  All right, well, guys, whatever.  Just, I don't know, have fun tonight.  Yeah.  Ladies, you know, give up the Hummer, please.  Yeah.  Get on your knees for fellatio!  Speaking of giving up the Hummer,  I want to thank Rick.  He did a great...  Not that...  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  You don't let me finish.  You don't let me finish.  Good job, Rick.  How are you?  No, I just put my foot in my mouth.  All right, I'll pick myself out of this.  Oh, my God. 
[02:06:00]  Rick did a great job on the F.U. Valentine's Day messages.  And what I was trying to say is the last one we played,  which will help me out of this,  it's a great call about someone not giving up the Hummer.  Oh, boy.  You might think you got out of that one, but...  We weren't rolling tape, right?  Oh, yeah.  No tape was running on that one.  Oh, I'm sure.  All right, guys, we'll see you tomorrow.  All right, check this out.  The last one of the day.  Now it's time for Messages of Love 
[02:06:30]  from the Opie and Anthony Show.  Happy Valentine's Day.  Hey, I'd like to send out a big F.U.  to my ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend.  Are you away this weekend?  I plugged away, my friend.  F.U., you stupid prick.  Next message.  Yes, I would like to give a big F.U. to my wife,  who has beautiful lips.  She has bigger lips than Angelina Jolie.  She's so good-looking, and she does not give Hummers.  You're a f***ing stupid bitch,  you're a f***ing whore thing,
