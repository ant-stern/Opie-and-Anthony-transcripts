<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a frank and highly offensive discussion about sex addiction.  Jim Norton, Rich Vos, and Robert Kelly shared their personal experiences, detailing compulsive masturbation, pornography addiction, and the difficulties in maintaining healthy relationships.  A caller, Wendy, a sex-addicted trucker, described her numerous sexual encounters and a potentially abusive childhood.  The conversation was punctuated by sexually explicit jokes and visual comedy attempts from Vos and Norton, and frequent tangents into unrelated, crude humor.  The segment concluded with further discussion of sex, sexual fantasies, and varied perspectives on the topic.

The show then transitioned to more sexually explicit discussions and anecdotes from the hosts and a caller.  These included graphic descriptions of various sexual acts, both heterosexual and homosexual, encounters with multiple partners, and preferences for different types of pornography and live sex acts. A particularly bizarre sexual encounter involving defecation was described in detail.

This was followed by a heated argument and physical altercation between Roland (of the Ron & Fez show) and Paolo, fueled by Paolo's criticism of Roland's film reviews.  The conflict escalated into personal insults, homophobic slurs, and threats of physical violence. Eastside Dave contributed by performing a satirical song about Roland.  The argument continued through several commercial breaks without resolution.

The verbal sparring quickly devolved into a physical fight between Eastside Dave and Roland, involving pushing, headlocks, and the use of a paddle, all while the hosts provided a profanity-laced commentary.  After the brawl, a quiz for Rich Vos followed, showcasing his consistently poor performance and humorous explanations for his incorrect answers.  The segment concluded with plans for a future "dumb-off" between Voss and other guests and a comically inaccurate discussion of the Bay of Pigs incident.  This segment also included several commercial breaks.

A significant portion of the show was then dedicated to reminiscing about 1980s television shows like *Dallas*, *Dynasty*, and *Falcon Crest*, with guest Jim Jefferies present. The hosts discussed the shows’ popularity and storylines, along with a discussion of Larry Hagman's death.  A two-and-a-half-minute comedy clip from a 1990 Bud Light competition featuring a young Jim Norton in MC Hammer pants was played, highlighting his early, raw comedic style.  The clip was abruptly cut short due to its explicit content.  This portion also included advertisements for various products (Fresh Balls, Omega-Q Plus, Adam & Eve, Wix.com, Barracuda Networks), a promotion for Candice Glover to benefit melanoma research, and discussion of a mortgage modification program and Voss’s business ventures. A segment of Bonnie McFarlane and Rich Voss' podcast "My Wife Hates Me" was also aired, showcasing their disagreement over Voss golfing on McFarlane’s birthday.


A lengthy and contentious conversation between Rich Voss and Bonnie McFarlane followed, focusing on their recent trip to New York City, their attempt to be featured on TMZ, and a visit to the American Girl doll store.  The conversation involved accusations of controlling behavior and exaggeration from both sides, detailing their experiences with the long TMZ wait, Bonnie’s passport difficulties, and Rich's perceived lack of consideration for her feelings. Raina's reactions to the events, including her upset over Netflix and the TMZ wait, were also discussed.  The argument, punctuated by profanity and commercial breaks (including ads for life insurance, financial planning, mortgages, online education, an Opie and Anthony internship, and adult products), concluded without resolution.

Finally, the broadcast included a single advertisement for a promotional code ("DOLL") offering ten free gifts with free shipping.

What is going on? This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show. Sirius XM.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. Better yet, the worst of Opie and Anthony. My name is  Erock and I am hosting this thing since Opie and Anthony are not here. And no, your radio  is not fucked up. I am just moving left to right on the microphone as I stand here recording 
[00:02:00]  all of this for you. Sex addiction. A lot of us have it. A lot of us don't. Mostly people  don't have this addiction, but there are some that do. Namely, Jim Norton, Rich Voss, Robert  Kelly. All at their names on Twitter. Pretty easy to find. But they have some great stories  talking about their sex addiction over the years, up to where they are now. Some have  overcome it. Some haven't. Who did? Who didn't? But they've got some great stories for the  long road that they have traveled. Sex addiction stories here on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:02:30]  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show on Sirius XM.  I want to talk about sex. Let's talk about that sex thing. Which sex thing? Jimmy's little  problem. Yeah, because that's a fucked up thing. I mean, we got people in the room that  are married and then we have some people that are getting married and then we have somebody  who's probably never going to be married, who gets to fuck his life away if he chooses  to. I'll get married someday. No, you're not, Jimmy. That's got to be the worst addiction 
[00:03:00]  though, man. A sex addiction. Because you've got to have it. Because you've got to have  the sex. How do you fucking cure that? You just got to, you have to stop doing certain  unhealthy things like fucking the masturbation. But then how do you get to the point that  you're having healthy sex? Yeah, but it's also a disconnection. You're disconnected from  something. Is there a cure for sex addiction? I really don't know. Do people get through  it? Well, it's like food addictions. I mean, you do it, but you just do it healthy.  That's all. And you just know. When something's healthy, when you're having healthy sex, it's 
[00:03:30]  okay. You just know it. And the difference is if I'm jerking off online and my dick's  not even hard and I'm coming for the third time of the day. You're at the wrong website.  It must be the comfortable chairs in here. I know. I feel a lot more comfortable over  here. Yeah, but you know what's weird is that there's guys that meet girls, they like  them and you talk to them, how's your sex life? Oh yeah, we fuck like once a day  or at least four times a week. And I'm like, you fuck the same? It's like, wow. And you 
[00:04:00]  got, you like her? It turns you on? Like I told my girl, I'm sorry, but you don't, it's  like, honey, she gets mad because she wants to come out in lingerie and be sexy and she  wants my dick to get hard. It's like, you have to, if you want my dick hard and you want  to fuck, you have to come over and grab my dick and fuck with it. It doesn't just stand  up on fucking end like a fucking new 18 year old in fucking Cleveland. You know what I  mean? It's, it's, you need to come over and it's like an old dog. You rub its belly and 
[00:04:30]  fucking jerk it off a little bit and I'll get hard and we'll be able to fuck. But I, and  these guys who fuck their, I know friends of mine who have girlfriends and fuck them and  it's like, wow. But all the time, like, but they're really into fucking their chick and  it's like, there's something about sex that is fucked up to me. Why aren't you into fucking  your chick? It's not that I'm not into fucking my chick. It's that I'm disconnected. Sex is  a bad thing. Sex was, I was taught sex in a fucked up way. So it's, it represents bad to 
[00:05:00]  me. So if I'm with somebody that I give a shit about it, I don't want to do bad shit to  that person. Exactly. I don't want to do shit, bad shit to her. I want to do, I don't  mind doing bad shit to some chick. I meet in New Brunswick that, you know, fuck her.  I don't give a shit. Like some, some chick that just wants to suck my cock. Fantastic.  My dick just goes, wow. I can't even fucking not have a hard on around her. But somebody  you give a shit about, it's like, it's like, fuck, this is bad. This is fucking bad.  How the fuck do you get over that? I don't know. You gotta, you got, you got, you have 
[00:05:30]  to go back and find out those things that happened that made it, exactly. That made  it bad. But you also stop acting out. Like, like if you stop acting out, like my dick has  been all over the place lately because I'm not, I mean, occasionally I am jerking off  and not nearly like what I was. I would literally go home after the show. I would try to nap  and I couldn't nap because I would jerk off and I wouldn't stop jerking off until it was  fucking, like I would force myself to go to the gym and then fucking, and then work out 
[00:06:00]  and then go to my spot and then, you know, jerk off again at night. It was awful, dude.  Don't you? Awful.  I jerk, in hotels on the road, I have to jerk off every day, but it doesn't take, you know,  it's different. If you're jerking off healthy, like if you just scrap a load, you throw some  lube on your dick and you're fucking pumping out all over yourself and taking nap.  Yeah, exactly.  That's fine.  But if you're on Craigslist for three hours, pumping down she-mails, not that I do that.  No, me neither, but I mean, you know, we're fucking she-mails.  And you get pre-cum coming out for the whole three hours. 
[00:06:30]  It's called edging.  Yeah, and then as soon as you find one and you just shoot it and it comes out, you feel  nothing.  Why don't you just jerk off really fast and maybe you can move on with other activities  for that day?  Believe me, right now that was Jim Norton in the mirror a thousand times.  I would love to know why I don't-  But what is that about?  It's escape. It's numbing feelings. My therapist told me it's to numb your feelings.  When you jerk off in the mirror, that's a sign of split personality.  Shut the fuck up.  It is a sign of split personality if you jerk off in the fucking mirror. 
[00:07:00]  That's creepy.  Maybe you just like looking at yourself jerking off.  Listen to me. I'm not a fucking doctor, but I know-  Really?  You're not, Dr. Kloss?  Really?  Wow.  It is something.  You're not even a fucking high school student.  You're barely human.  It is something about, you don't feel, and it sounds gay, but you have to learn how to  feel something.  It's actually because you don't want to, because you grow up with so much fucking pain,  with whatever's happening, that you learn how to do things that make you not feel pain. 
[00:07:30]  I've jacked, though, to fucking websites and shit like that, and, you know, spent a long  time doing it.  You know, you wait, you wait, you get right to the brink and stop.  Yeah, but you pay for whores.  Because it fucking feels good.  There's no deep, dark fucking secret there.  For some people it is.  That's what these guys are getting at.  That's what I'm saying.  Like, a guy like you is a fucking amazing to me, because you're connected in a fucking  different way.  You can jack off and then go fucking pay your bills and fucking do shit. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, but also, and then he can go drink and buy guns, so you have the same thing.  But you have, you fan it out, okay?  I don't drink anymore.  I don't do drugs anymore.  I did quit smoking.  My eating is not bad, so it all fucking comes out to my hand, my nipples, and my dick.  All of it.  All of that self-hatred, all that big thing just dumps out that way.  Dumps out your cock.  Yeah, all that need to escape.  Comes out your dick hole.  If I could fucking, if I was eating cake until fucking three in the morning, or drinking 
[00:08:30]  again, I would, it wouldn't be as bad.  Then you'd be Bobby Kelly.  Well, you know what, honest to God, though, I mean, food is just like sex, because you're  on the fucking road, and you don't want to, you don't want to get a whore, you don't want  to fucking go to a massage parlor, you don't want to let some chick with fucking warts come  into your fucking room, and dry fucking boner.  So you're like, fuck it.  You get a pizza, and it actually, you disconnect.  It's a gratification.  It's that quick fix.  It's the same with comedy.  It's not feeling.  You don't want to feel.  It's not that you don't want to feel, you want to feel, you want to feel, you want to 
[00:09:00]  feel quickly, and you want to rush more.  No, it's that you don't want to feel anything.  I'm just laughing at the Voss finger pretzels.  Don't bite your finger.  Get it?  They're real small.  He just has mustard on his fingernail.  Yeah.  Jimmy, what are you doing?  We're having a serious discussion about your problems.  It's going to make a hand.  It's going to make Voss's hand out of the pretzels.  Here's the thing. 
[00:09:30]  Fucking visual jokes on the radio.  Here's the thing.  Well, you've got five little pretzels in your hand.  He just did a chin joke.  Voss's hand, yes, of course.  Very funny, Jimmy.  So, Jimmy, where's this going to go?  I don't know.  I hope that I can stay away from it.  Let me swallow my pretzels.  Because it's fucking making my life miserable.  Is it?  Awful.  It looks like it's making it miserable, though, not doing it.  No. 
[00:10:00]  No?  Can't you change your practices?  Well, yeah.  Like Ope said, you know, just jack off and shoot and then go about your business.  But, yeah.  But I wasn't even jerking off when I was horny.  I was just jerking off because it was something.  That's the thing.  If you're horny and you're like, fuck it, I want to scrap a load.  That's healthy.  You don't need to scrap a load.  No one cares.  I'm not saying I wouldn't do that.  But I don't know how to do that.  Like, what I do is I wind up on Craigslist.  Just look at it, ads.  Or I wind up on one of eight websites and it's fucking hours and it's fucking endless. 
[00:10:30]  Well, like Ope said, just fucking jack off.  Yeah, but it sounds like there's like an OCD thing happening there, too.  I know what you mean, but no.  Just because it's like there's a tick.  It is about a tick.  The boss is right and Bobby's right.  It is about feeling nothing and numbing yourself.  And it is a quick fix in the sense that you're getting a rush.  It's that endorphin release.  It's like a drug.  Let's be honest.  When a guy comes, there's a major disappointment right after you come.  It's like you go from a really cool high to poof. 
[00:11:00]  Let me tell you something.  You're just crashing hard.  You've got to help them with our homework.  Jerking off is like a big hug.  It's like a hug from the dad you never had.  It's just God.  A fucking lonely hug of spools.  Well, it was the same as when you used to...  Women jump up and start doing chores and they're just happy after and stuff.  And guys, there's a massive crash that happens.  But we're brought up on sex in a fucked up...  We're brought up with porn and magazines and fuck, fuck, fuck this bitch.  I fucked that bitch.  Women have brought up the opposite spectrum. 
[00:11:30]  It's like find somebody you love and fucking romance and blah, blah, blah.  And you don't want to fuck.  We're brought up.  Fuck that bitch.  You fucked that bitch.  I fucked that.  I mean, so we're brought up in a fucked up way.  It's just...  And it sucks for us.  My wife was born and I could do it.  Well, that's because there had to be a balance made.  Or else nothing would get done in this world.  We'd all just be fucking.  Or, if it was the other way around, human beings wouldn't exist. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, but then there's a point...  There's a point in life that when you meet a chick you like,  and all of a sudden you're supposed to be like them.  You're supposed to...  Hey, let's make love.  You know, fuck, what?  What?  Let's say hi to Wendy the trucker.  She's a sex addict.  I think we should take some sex addict calls.  Oh, I'd love to.  Sex addict calls today.  Yes, Wendy?  Wendy.  Hi.  Hey.  I just wanted to say that I totally understand how Jimmy feels.  I'm a sex addict, and I've gone to therapy. 
[00:12:30]  Wendy, can I stop you for a second?  I've got to be honest.  I'm not even trying to be a radio dick guy.  You know, when a girl says she's a sex addict, it's kind of hot.  I don't mean to be a dick, but...  What kind of...  How did you act out?  It's more like the hunt.  I kind of like married men.  You're saying it wrong.  They're a lot easier to get, but it's just the thrill of the hunt.  Thank you.  Once you get them and have sex, then you don't want them anymore.  Yep.  Huh, so how many guys are you fucking? 
[00:13:00]  Huh?  How many guys were you fucking?  It's probably in the hundreds.  Wow.  I've been married, and it's been hard being married because sex gets really boring when  you're with that person once you have them.  I have to masturbate, like, every night before I go to bed a couple times sometimes.  Were you still married?  No.  What's the most guys you've had in, like, a weekend?  In a weekend?  Yeah. 
[00:13:30]  Probably, like, four.  Four or five.  Four guys in one weekend?  Four or five?  It's easy on the road because, you know, I have my choice of men.  Are you pretty?  Are you good-looking?  Yeah.  For the trucking world, yeah.  So a lot of black men.  Oh, yeah.  I'll do a black man.  Yeah.  You ever gang bang?  No, just two guys.  Two guys?  Tag teaming?  Jesus.  A little put-you-on-the-rotisserie deal?  Two brothers. 
[00:14:00]  Been to the...  Two brothers?  I've tried the, like, swinger parties.  Those are all right.  Yeah.  The women get a little jealous there, so you have to go to predominantly male ones, but...  You pick them up at rest areas?  You've got to have the thrill.  Do you park your Peterbilt in your cunt?  Jesus.  Anthony.  Anthony's interviews.  I wish Dr. Phil did his...  So how many guys you fuck?  It's kind of like the story, you know?  Why are you scared of catching something? 
[00:14:30]  Fucking fuck.  Jesus.  I use protection.  I mean, I'm not just going to pick any fat trucker there and have sex with them.  Right.  Yeah.  Like, do you like giving head?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  So, like, you would just be at a truck stop and decide you want to suck some cock?  Yeah.  Wow.  That's pretty cool.  And I have my little thing.  I get to the truck stop.  I go in, take my shower, put on nice clothes, you know, do my hair and makeup, and I find  the guy.  I pick out the guy that I want to have sex with. 
[00:15:00]  How do you find him?  How do you pick him out?  There's just a connection.  You just know.  And what about the approach?  What about the approach?  You walk up to him.  What do you do?  I just find something to talk about.  I give him a look.  I've been told I have...  I just have this look that I want to be fucked in my eyes.  But yet, I'm very kind of...  Have a treat for a week before you get there.  Hey, Wendy, do you have a MySpace that we can look at? 
[00:15:30]  I do.  Do you want to give it out?  You'll get...  You'll get...  It's a trucker stick.  69.  Of course.  69.  69.  You know what that means.  Where are you as far as trying to take care of this?  As far as what?  Where are you?  Like, are you still...  Are you getting help?  Or are you just...  What are you doing?  Still just fucking...  Well, I'm in a new relationship.  I tried the therapy once.  The guy I was with thought I was just full of it.  Language.  So I gave up on it. 
[00:16:00]  And now I'm just trying with self-control.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  We got Bob the Trucker.  Bob, what's up?  Yeah, this is Bob the Trucker.  I'm just wondering where Wendy's going to be tonight.  At a buffet.  Well, we might have seen a picture.  Wait a minute.  Is that you?  All she has to do is let me know and I'll meet her there.  I'll tell you where she's going to be.  Hoping Danny DeVito and Billy Crystal don't throw off a train.  Was that her?  All right.  Where is... 
[00:16:30]  Let's see a picture of Wendy.  Is that the only one we got?  Oh, she's not bad.  Is that you taking your own picture with a cell phone in a mirror?  No, I don't think there's any of those on there.  Oh, wait.  How do we find a picture of you then?  We're on your MySpace.  It's Trucker T-R-U-C-K-E-R-C-H-I-C.  Trucker Chick 69.  Trucker Sheik.  Oh, good.  That wasn't you.  Thank God that wasn't you.  All right.  Yeah, we just saw a slob of a person.  Prisoner of the highway. 
[00:17:00]  Are you sure that's not you?  Prisoner of the highway?  All right.  Here's...  Is that you?  Wait, wait.  There might be some MySpace fraud going on there.  Yeah, I know.  You've got to hold up a newspaper with a date on it.  You're only showing your eyes.  That's never a good sign when you have that on MySpace.  Those are her fuck-me eyes.  Let me see.  This girl...  This one, much better than the MySpace page we just had on.  What she's not saying?  Wow.  If you find MySpace and my pictures, there's a couple pictures in there. 
[00:17:30]  I have to kind of keep it clean for my kids.  You're not bad from the forehead up.  Jesus Christ.  You got them big tits?  I'm just fucking white.  Honestly, she's not that bad.  She's not bad.  I mean, for a truck stop, no job.  How shallow are we?  She calls it a better addiction, and we're like, how big are your tits?  Not bad.  Yeah, she's trying to share with us.  I know.  We're trying to do something a little different today, and we failed again.  What are we doing that's different?  Bob's stupid, Voss is stupid, and I can't stop eating on the air.  Sounds like everything from October 2004. 
[00:18:00]  You're a little chubby, but I'd fuck you.  Nice.  I am.  I'm chubby, but like I said, I'm here in the trucking world.  I'm not bad.  Maybe just cut out two blowjobs a week and go work out.  You definitely got the fuck me eyes.  That's for sure.  You use those eyes, I think you're getting whatever you want.  Yeah.  That's what I've been told.  Why don't you make extra money at the truck stops and just get paid for blowing a couple  truckers if you like doing it?  Because it can't be that easy.  Can I ask you a question?  There's got to be some game to it, you know? 
[00:18:30]  Don't make them hide the money.  Bob Kelly wants to ask us something.  I just want to ask you a question.  Do you like if you meet a guy where you just suck his cock?  Yeah.  Like you don't have to fuck him?  You just meet a guy and just suck it?  I met this one guy.  We were getting our trucks loaded and it was like instant connection and we were in my  truck and I was done blowing him within 10 minutes.  From meeting to swallowing cum in 10 minutes? 
[00:19:00]  Yep.  You let a guy fuck you in the mouth, cutting ass?  Yeah.  Wow.  And you'll swallow the load?  Yeah.  That's good protection.  What are you protecting it from?  Sometimes it just happens.  Wendy, where did this come from, you think?  Oh, probably the typical abuse of the child.  Oh, boy.  Sex abuse?  What happened?  From who?  You know, the father thing and older guy things.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Slow down, Wendy. 
[00:19:30]  Slow down.  You had sex with your father?  No, no.  I don't think so.  He molested my sister.  What did he do to her?  I was pretty young, so I don't remember if anything happened with her.  Were you jealous of that?  He molested her.  How did you molest her?  Um, I really don't know.  She was older than me.  I was the, uh, tried to save the marriage baby, so my parents divorced when I was young.  Did you, so did your dad touch?  And then he ended up on the carnival.  Did your dad, I'm sorry, did your dad make you touch his weenie?  I don't remember. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, boy.  Blocking it out, you think?  Huh?  Uh, Brian H. wants to know if you're in Maine, because he'll fuck you right now.  Like, what part of the country are you in?  No, I'm in Arkansas.  Arkansas, okay.  So, so if I, if I went, if I saw you at a truck stop, and I was, I just looked at you  and I go, I just want you to suck my cock, would you do it?  Um, it depends if there was that connection.  Like, you go, I cocked to your mouth?  You just walk up and go like, hey, how you doing? 
[00:20:30]  And, uh, you know, what are you hauling?  Blah, blah, blah, truck talk.  And then you go like, uh, hey, why don't you come into my, uh, into my sleeper?  Hold on, hold on, we might have a guy that, uh, actually, uh, got blown by her.  Uh, Dano.  Hey, guys, what's up?  What's up?  We got Wendy the sex addict trucker on the other line.  Yeah, that was Evansville, Indiana.  Nope.  No?  Okay, sorry, guys.  It's like a new game show on the over here. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  Did you fuck her?  Where did you get blown?  Sometimes I don't even know their name.  Like, one guy that I've seen a couple times, I don't remember his name, but I just call  him my Happy Meal guy.  Oh.  Because we met at McDonald's.  Oh, okay.  I thought maybe he gave you some, uh, a Happy Meal.  Let me, uh.  He just knows him as.  Let's get Johnny from Pennsylvania on the line.  Johnny.  Hey, what's up, bubba boys?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Uh, Wendy.  Hey, why don't you rub one out for us? 
[00:21:30]  I've been on the road since you're so hot, huh?  Yeah, Wendy, would you masturbate for everybody?  Um, I can.  I'm driving.  And I do have a boyfriend who's in the sleeper, so.  Oh, I see.  Do me a favor.  She can't have tabs on you.  Unzip it.  Unzip his pants and take out his cock while he's sleeping.  Yeah, why don't you, like, pull over and, uh, blow him?  Why don't you take out his cock?  Huh?  Take out his cock right now while you're driving.  Take out his cock, a sucker.  I've done that before.  Yeah, I've had to pull over because he'll come up.  He'll walk up and have a hard on and I'll have to give him an edge. 
[00:22:00]  Wow.  It's actually people who try to talk dirty, but they're always congested.  Take out his cock and put your mouth.  Yeah.  Hey, does he know you're a sex addict?  Huh?  Does he know you're a sex addict?  Yeah, he's finding that out.  I've told him, and, uh, when I don't get it for a while, I get really bitchy.  Does he get a big, does he get a big piece?  No.  No, what's he got, like six inches?  Yeah.  Six inches is pretty big.  And you've probably, you've probably been with guys with huge cocks, right? 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  Do you like a bigger cock?  Yeah.  Do you like a cock when you, when you take it out of your mouth, you have to make that sound?  Do what?  Well, it's so, it's so big when you take it out, you just, that's not, you have to, that  sound?  Vacuum seals around our lips.  The other thing you said, I did catch, uh, you said you were raised in a carnival?  Yeah.  Circus.  What?  What was that all about?  Um, when my mom divorced my dad, she decided she wanted to go travel. 
[00:23:00]  People on the carnival, so we did that for, and how old were you?  Did people pay a quarter to see you under a tent?  Yeah.  How old were you?  The magnificent sword swallower.  How old were you, Wendy?  I know, I'm just helping you.  I was, um, 10.  Oh, okay, you definitely got fucking touched at the carnival.  Bobby, what's wrong?  What happened?  We're in the middle of talking to Wendy, the sex addict.  Fucking, this is his rotten calamari ass.  Oh, it just looks like a squid mouth. 
[00:23:30]  He should have a beak coming out of his asshole.  All right.  A little seerchid ass.  Yeah, he should shoot black dye from his asshole when he gets scared.  Well, Wendy, thanks for calling the show.  Wow, Wendy.  So, Wendy, how long have you been, how long have you been, you know, not, how long has  this, you've been not fucking?  Um, I met this guy in September, so I've been with one guy since September. 
[00:24:00]  You haven't fucked anybody since September?  Come on.  Just him.  Is it hard?  Yes.  His cock hard, right now it's hard, his cock?  Um.  Do you eat his asshole?  Not yet.  Why not?  He's letting the experiment thing.  Did you ever get a big asshole pube with a root on it, still on it, stuck in your teeth?  Fuck you, you know what, leave it.  I told him he's got to clean up the apple a little bit, you know.  He's got to clean it up. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, fucking Bob.  Jesus.  A root.  That's great.  It looks like, it looks like a scallion.  That is, that is disgusting.  Have you ever, have you ever, you know, you have to know, right?  Have you ever came, have you ever had an orgasm by sucking somebody else's, by sucking a dick?  Hold on.  Wait, hold on.  I, I, I stopped.  Please, can I just say something?  What the fuck is that about? 
[00:25:00]  Never put me in the same category as stupid.  What the fuck was that about?  By sucking a dick, that's what I meant.  What the fuck was that about?  Jesus Christ.  Whoops, whoopsie.  What the fuck?  Jesus Christ.  What the fuck was that about?  I, I meant to say, have you, she ever had an orgasm?  We also know what you did say.  Oh my God.  Jesus.  Jesus Christ.  Whoopsie.  Whoopsie. 
[00:25:30]  What did I say?  By sucking somebody else's dick?  By actually.  Wow.  Wow.  Have you ever had an orgasm by giving somebody a head?  That's too late now.  I guess Voss had an incident where he sucked some guy's cock.  He wants to know if you can relate to that.  By rubbing on the guy's leg like a shih tzu.  And he just wants to know if you can relate to that.  Were you so horned up like Voss was when he was sucking another man's cock?  He just shot his load out of his daisy dukes.  Yeah.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.

Lovely conversations during the break.  Talking about shitting.  Sucking cock.  Sucking cock, trying to see if there's any truth to Rich's slip-up during the last segment.  He said he never sucked and he just held it in front of his mouth.  And maybe, I bet you he took it and then bounced it off his own lip like, 
[00:31:00]  wah, wah, wah, wah.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  That's the sound it makes when you're about to service an older gentleman and you're trying  to turn him off.  He just rubbed the tip just to get the pre-sem like Carmex on his lips.  Oh.  He just rubbed it around.  Oh.  Do you ever do that?  All right, Rich, have you ever had your dick in another man's mouth?  Ew. 
[00:31:30]  When?  I said...  Let's say hi to Jeff the trucker.  Jeff, what do you got?  Hold on, Jeff.  This is the sound it makes if you just bounce it off your pro slips.  Fuck.  Jeff, what do you got for the show?  Help us out here.  It's like a smoke and a cigar.  How's it going, guys?  Hey, no way.  Go ahead, Jeff.  Hey, you're on.  I was just saying, I just wanted to let you guys know, you know, I didn't have a fucked  up childhood or nothing like that. 
[00:32:00]  It was all good for me.  You know, my folks are great, but, you know, I'm fucking horrible, man.  I look at fucking porn for hours, and then I can't help myself.  I got to go get some, you know?  And I'll get hooker after hooker.  And it's fucking mad.  I can't help myself, you know?  I'm blasting potato flakes all over my meat pocket.  Why hookers? 
[00:32:30]  They're easy to get, you know?  But hookers.  Why not?  But you can't even kiss them.  Why not?  They're right there.  They're slutty, you know?  It's easy to do.  I'm a fat fuck, so, you know.  Oh, okay.  There you go.  Yeah, that's no big deal.  Hey, Bobby, when you have sex with your wife, do you kiss her?  I'm not fucking talking about that.  Are you a fucking cunt?  What?  I'm just asking if you're talking about disconnecting and sex and stuff.  I think, I think, I think, but this guy's talking about a whole, another thing, too, 
[00:33:00]  is that, I mean, you know, when you have shitty self-esteem and you hate yourself, it's so  easy to, you know, you're not going to go to a bar and try to meet a chick.  You're going to go fucking, dude.  Jimmy just makes the face to me.  Dude, it's all about hating yourself, dude.  See, dude, if you hate yourself, you're going to wind up bad like you hate, dude.  You know, this is the funniest thing is, I can't even, I can't even say anything.  I don't even have a fucking brain unless I go, dude, shut your face.  Dude.  Listen, I was just saying that about, I don't like how Jimmy made himself the smartest 
[00:33:30]  comic in the fucking room.  You're not.  You're not.  No, you're not, you fucking, you fucking, you call me every time you have any glitch  in your fucking electronic life.  That's right.  You call a plumber when you're shit in the vault, so I call a lot of people.  You call me, me, and this asshole, this asshole will actually teach it back to you.  You're not the smartest comic in the room.  He teaches it back to you.  All right.  All right, go ahead.  Prove that you're smarter than Jimmy.  Hold on, hold on.  Prove that you're smarter than Jimmy, Bobby.  What's a parabyte? 
[00:34:00]  I'm not saying that he's not funny.  He's hilarious, and he's fast.  I have terabytes on my computer.  It's fucking hard drive space.  I know what terabyte is.  Good for you.  I know.  But this is a fact, is that Jimmy, admit this.  Whatever you put in a sandwich.  Don't say fuck.  That's a taradacto bite.  Oh, you're fucking right.  You know what?  It was my smashing, and I'm mad at you. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, yeah.  First of all, I was asking you about your wife, because I don't kiss as much, and you  were talking about disconnecting and the sex thing, and that's why I asked you to kiss  when you make love.  That's all.  It wasn't a personal thing.  Yeah, it is.  You're talking about my wife and kissing.  No, I'm talking about you.  How is that not personal?  Because you talked about sex with your wife.  How do you go from you sucking a cock?  You just said, well, if I want my wife to get me hard, she just can't come in with a  negligee.  She's got to pull my cock.  I always ask you a normal question about kissing, and you're talking about fucking hand.  He shot an elastic at Norton's ass, and it caught it. 
[00:35:00]  It just disappeared in Norton's ass.  A baby hand shot out.  Boss, do you kiss Bonnie when you're having sex?  Not that much.  That's what I'm saying.  Why?  Huh?  Why?  Because it's just, kissing shows too much affection.  Do you kiss when you're a girl?  Are you making eye contact and kiss?  Yes.  I don't do that.  What's wrong with that?  I don't do that.  See, exactly.  You're one of those guys. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  You're one of those guys.  Oh, look at this.  He's like a little romantic.  Who kisses?  No one kisses in love.  Yeah, but I'll kiss somebody, but not a girlfriend.  Like, I'll kiss in that situation, but not with a girlfriend.  You weren't kissing your girlfriend?  You don't kiss hookers.  Sometimes.  No, not when we're having sex.  Like a good...  Oh, no.  She didn't want to kiss me either.  She would close her eyes and pretend I was anyone but me.  What would you do if you were fucking me?  Bonnie.  Rich, you and Bonnie, when did you stop kissing her?  What's that?  Anthony, what happened?  What are you doing over there? 
[00:36:00]  What happened?  Jimmy's fart smells so fucking bad.  I don't smell it.  Dude, it didn't hit you.  It's pure shit.  It's fucking evil.  It is evil incarnate.  It's like shit is coming out.  We didn't know what you were doing, and we thought you were going to a bad place or something.  What the hell was happening with you?  I was going to a bad place.  Stinkville.  All right, Rich.  Jesus.  When did you stop kissing Bonnie?  I mean, I kissed her once in a blue.  When you were first dating, I'm sure you were kissing like crazy, right? 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, I used to kiss her.  I think the kissing slows down a little bit, but...  Yeah, I think the kissing does, because like, well, you know, I mean, it's not...  So when you're having sex, you don't kiss her?  Don't look her in the eye?  What's going on?  No.  Well, something...  No, not in the eye.  I try to...  Because I...  No.  Back of the neck?  I just put my head to the side, and, you know...  And crud.  And just think about whatever I can to keep it hard.  Wait, do you say I love you while you're having sex?  Will you say, like, I love you, babe?  Yeah.  Really?  Maybe not every time, but...  You're looking right at her when you say it, and she's looking back. 
[00:37:00]  Why are you making me look like I'm a...  No, you're normal, but that's fucking a creep.  You're not supposed to have...  Good for you.  You're supposed to have a fucked up background, too.  You shouldn't be able to do all that good stuff.  Well, my background isn't fucked up sex-wise.  My background's fucked up with, like, a mom and other things.  Yeah, but that's what distorts your sexual fucking...  Yeah, but you guys have, like, fucked up sex backgrounds.  What's going to happen when you...  What's going to happen someday...  I mean, aren't you worried that someday she's going to want a...  She's going to want a little...  You know, she's not going to want... 
[00:37:30]  You know, I love you, I love you, too.  She's going to want you fucking little pussy.  Get the fuck over here.  Not to, like, get too personal, but it's not all...  You know, it's a variety.  We talk about this.  Relationships need lust and love.  You've got to understand that that whole lust thing has to be part of your relationship.  Are you a dirty talker?  I can't picture you talking dirty.  Do you get mean?  Do you get, like, too mean?  No, I don't get mean.  No, you like that?  You fucking idiot.  I'm an over-repeer.  That's Anthony.  You just get way too mean. 
[00:38:00]  You like that?  You fucking moron.  Fucking Jew-lover.  You fucking...  You dirty fucking kike.  Holy shit.  You fucking like that?  You like that?  Yeah?  Liberal?  You'd be surprised.  Did I ever tell you how much I hate your cunt mother?  You'd be surprised.  I'm very romantic.  Are you really?  I'm a romantic.  What do you say?  Like, I love you, baby?  That feels so good.  Oh, that feels so good, baby.  That feels so good.  Like, like...  That feels so good.  Yeah, I kind of give, like, a play-by-play, maybe.  A little bit.  Oh, yeah.  That's it.  Put it in your mouth.  That's right.  Put it in your mouth like it's a fucking Smith & Wesson. 
[00:38:30]  Right.  You don't say ticket bullets all over your chin and back.  You're chipping her teeth with your desert eagle.  But he has to hand out name tags just to make sure he's...  Jeez.  Keeps it all organized.  Do you ever fantasize watching your wife tag somebody else?  Oh, yeah.  I like you a lot.  Look down at her name tag.  Do you think that's fantasy?  Anthony has a registration booth in his front fucking lobby.  Jesus.  Please sign in, please.  Yeah, stop at the help desk and then come back to the millionaire's cock. 
[00:39:00]  Anthony's very private and holds his cards very close to his chest.  But this is what we're imagining, that there's a registration process.  So Voss asked a good question.  Voss asked a sick question.  I heard it.  What, Voss?  Do you fantasize, like, your wife or girlfriend banging somebody else?  See, I'm not...  I can't go down that road.  Why would you fantasize about that?  That one bothers me.  Why?  It's so wrong.  I never told my chick that, of course.  But while her eyes were closed, just whatever the hell she was going, I was just pretending 
[00:39:30]  that I was watching.  There was, like, five guys teaching her a lesson.  Actually, I actually...  Not five, but...  I keep my eyes shut because I don't want to see the guy's balls and assholes that she's  blowing while I'm fucking.  Well, I had this one girl, and I fucked it up.  I can't believe I fucked this up.  I didn't even get to fuck her.  She blew me a couple of times.  That's because my fantasy is three guys in every orifice, you know?  Wait, three guys in every...  That's nine guys.  No, I mean, you know, one in each.  Nine guys.  All right.  He talks in every...  She's not a guy in the Guinness Book.  You're welcome to cigarettes. 
[00:40:00]  You're right.  He is the smartest because he can multiply.  You know what I'm saying.  And I fucked it up with her.  But you gotta be...  See, it's gotta be, like, a real someone you're close with.  It can't be just a girl you're fucking...  It's gotta be someone you're connected with.  I used to...  I fucked up a lot of relationships when I was younger because my thing was...  And it was a fucked up...  I used to do it to test the chick.  Because I don't trust women.  I fucking hate...  I hate women.  Obviously.  So I used to get them...  I used to get them, like them, and then if I really liked them, I'd try to get them 
[00:40:30]  to blow my friends.  I know that's fucked up.  I was up with you guys.  Holy fuck.  And I would...  You know what?  95% of them would blow my friends.  How would you get that done, though?  I would be like, okay, I knew it.  She's a fucking whore.  Fuck you.  But how would...  But then...  Hold on, hold on.  You're jumping way ahead.  Like, how would you get her to blow your friends?  You start fucking her, and then you start fantasizing, and you're joking around, you see where they're 
[00:41:00]  at, and then you start making her tell you if she could, would she, and they're usually  like, no, no.  And then you get them to finally admit, like, yeah, I would.  And then they start getting into it because they think it gets you off, so they'll stop  being like, yeah, I'd fucking suck as you like that.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden, one night she shows up and your friend is, hey, what's going  on?  I just stop by at two in the morning, how you guys doing?  And then, you know, you leave him alone for a second, and then you leave him alone, and  then she'll start, you know... 
[00:41:30]  Do you let your friend in on this?  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  You tell him, look, this is the deal.  One time I did it, I said, you come over, I'm going to leave you alone, you start talking,  I'm going to come back in, we're going to go in the other room, I'm going to get her  to stop blowing me, then you walk in while she's blowing me, and she's going to keep  blowing me, and just take your cock out.  Don't fucking, don't panic, just take your cock out, and that's it.  Come over and take your cock out.  And then they come on, take their cock out, and she, I'm telling you, it turns me on right 
[00:42:00]  now, once the chick you're dating, and all of a sudden she looks over and sees another  cock, and then she just goes for it, you're like, oh God, oobly, oobly.  But you're going out with this girl.  Kind of.  Not in love, but you're going out with her, and then all of a sudden she blows him, and  then, you know, it's kind of fucked up.  See, but it's like hostage, because then you show up hostage negotiations with his potential  girls.  It backfired on me.  It backfired on me.  I mean, there's one girl that I really like, hot chick, and I tried to get her to do it, 
[00:42:30]  and she kind of, she was kind of fantasizing.  And then, this is so fucked up.  My friend was in the other room, and I opened the door to my room, and was fucking her doggy  style, halfway out the door.  You know what I mean?  And then she just was like, you know, I was like, yeah, you fucking suck it.  What if he came right now?  What if he walked in here?  Would you grab his cock?  And she was like, stop, stop.  This is bullshit.  She started crying.  And then she left.  Oh God, what a bad scene.  Yeah, she dumped me, too. 
[00:43:00]  Did you end up blowing him?  Oh shit.  Because he wanted a blowjob.  I know, I should have.  See, the problem is, the worst part is, is I was actually, at the time, living with six  I was living with six retarded men.  I was their counselor.  Yeah, I've heard these stories.  And I'm banging a chick in the hallway.  Don't repeat the story, because some guy's going to call up and say, here's the thing.  Big fucking retarded mule comes out.  The problem is, I'm just sucking on it.  See, because you, Kim, it's drooling already.  Not him, you idiot.  Yeah, his fingers.  You can't use friends.  You've got to use fake people in those fantasies. 
[00:43:30]  He takes his wig off and puts it on her head.  Hold it for me.  She wants a baseball sign because she faces Pete Rose.  You didn't tell me you knew Pete Rose.  Boss, what do you have?  No, I'm just, it's, it's, it's, you can't use your real friends in a fantasy like that.  It's got to be a complete unknown.  What are you out of your mind?  Why wouldn't you use your friends?  How come his head and his neck just have like one line?  There's no face shape. 
[00:44:00]  There's no lower face.  Holy shit.  It goes.  That stupid puzzled look.  She's sucking his dick.  That dumb fucking look on his face.  His head starts opening close.  Why does Pete Rose look so scared?  Why does Pete, why is only one of his eyes opening?  Oh, God.  Why is Pete Rose's tongue so long? 
[00:44:30]  Oh, fuck.  Bobby, Pete Rose is shitting on the floor.  He just constantly spirals out of control.  It's fucking too funny.  Pete Rose did not touch my head.  He has jelly on his fingers.  Going back to Bobby's story. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, God.  Sean brings up something that comes up a lot, Bobby.  And I'm just going to read this.  If you're in the same building, let alone the same room with the guy who's got his cock out,  that's fucking gay.  No, it is.  Shut up.  A lot of guys who say that.  Get the fuck out of here.  Get the fuck out of here.  Get the fuck out of here.  You have such a...  Really?  So what do you do?  Get on top and fuck her like a man?  Fuck you, you fuck.  I know.  Get a cock near your cock.  Stop being sad.  That's a man.  A man can get close to another guy's cock.  Calm down, Bobby.  You're gay. 
[00:45:30]  Here's the thing.  It's coming in a lot.  But it's coming in a lot.  If a guy blew me, that would...  I'm just saying.  This is something that comes up a lot.  A guy's never blown me.  But if a guy blew me, it wouldn't make me gay.  It makes him gay.  Okay?  All right, Rich.  No, but I'm not saying...  I'm not saying you have to fucking suck a cock.  No, I didn't say I suck the cock.  I'm saying...  A pussy needs to be in the room.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay, so if there's a pussy in the room, and some guy blows you...  No, your dick needs to be in her mouth or pussy.  I mean, you can't just have two cocks out and no pussy in the room. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, it's done it a million times.  Me and my friends have doubled so many fucking broads.  Bobby...  And you should be having fun.  Bobby, why is Pete Rose wearing a hat with a propeller on?  I'm not going to shit myself.  I'm fucking laughing so hard.  I can't look at Jimmy.  I can't fucking look at him.  I hate that fucking guy's Pete Rose.  Holy shit.  Goddamn, I'm crying.  What gets you more... 
[00:46:30]  If you're looking at...  What gets you more excited?  If you look at two girls eating...  If you're ready to jerk off, say you were looking at porn.  Two girls eating pussy or a girl blowing a guy?  I like both.  What?  No, no.  That's not the question.  I don't...  There's no...  There's no...  What gets you more excited?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  What do you...  Yeah.  I like...  I like...  I like Pete Rose sucking on a lollipop while he's getting head.  Oh, these guys are fucking...  Oh, shit. 
[00:47:00]  I can't take it.  Holy fuck.  Everyone are fucking...  Retard jokes.  There's like three shows going on in one time.  It's fucking hilarious.  I'm sorry.  I couldn't look at Jimmy because he's laughing so fucking hard about Pete Rose that I start  cracking up.  I'm crying.  I'm fucking tears coming out of my eyes from that fucking Jimmy, man.  Oh.  That's funny.  All right.  This guy's going to back you up. 
[00:47:30]  This does come up a lot, though.  Let's say hi to Will and Charlotte.  Will.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, it's hard to hear you.  So, uh...  Listen, I'm...  All these guys saying it's gay if there's another rule...  Another guy in the room.  Uh...  They're just basically not confident with themselves.  I got a friend of mine.  Him and his wife hang out with me and my chick.  They get it on.  You know, we're fucking right next to each other.  It's not a big deal.  It's nothing.  You just...  You know, it's all about being confident with yourself. 
[00:48:00]  These guys are, uh...  I think they get a little timid of the penis.  Do you...  Does your wife and, uh...  Does his wife and your girl fool around?  Oh, yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah, definitely.  You know, we get them in the shower.  You know, all that stuff.  And, uh...  You know, you go back and forth.  Whatever.  But it's not gay just because there's another penis in the room.  Do you bang his wife while he bangs your girlfriend?  No.  That's not.  Neither one of the chicks are cool with that.  It's not a full swap.  Oh.  What would you rather look at?  I will say the first time it ever happened...  Two girls.  Kind of girl.  I was fucking my chick and he was fucking his wife and his hairy leg rubbed on mine and 
[00:48:30]  I lost everything.  I don't know what I'd rather watch, though, because two chicks is almost too mild to me.  Yeah.  Like, I've seen that so many times.  Like, there's something dirtier about a chick blowing a guy.  Like, to me, that's more of a sex...  Because it's so acceptable.  Yeah.  And I'm not saying two chicks doesn't turn me on.  It does.  But it's almost like that turned me on when I was 20.  Yeah.  I'm not talking about porno, either.  I don't either.  Lesbian porn, it don't turn me on as much as watching...  No, I'm not even talking porno. 
[00:49:00]  I'm talking, like, you're at a party, let's say, and there's a bedroom and there's two  chicks in bed.  That can be really hot.  On the bed and you're fucking just watching.  That's hot.  That or a guy fucking a chick in a bed at a party or something.  What would you rather, like, peep in on?  Really hard to say.  It depends.  I'd much rather see the...  And it's not a homophobic thing, but I'd rather see the two girls going at it.  I might do it many times.  I'd rather watch the video.  We asked you.  I've seen... 
[00:49:30]  We saw a live sex show in Brazil, and it didn't fucking turn me on as much as I was in Albany.  I'm talking amateurs.  I saw two chicks eating each other's pussies was actually turned me on more live.  Live, watching two chicks eat each other's pussies was fucking...  I don't...  Watching it, it doesn't do anything for me.  Live, it fucking...  I almost turned myself...  I'd rather have them just, like, you know, going around and kissing and shit.  Like, two girls in bed, totally naked, making out with each other and feeling each other and stuff.  Not just two porn chicks fucking 69 snatch eating. 
[00:50:00]  I'm talking, like, some fucking heavy petting going on and shit.  Or gay porn.  That would be...  You ever watched gay porn?  What?  Jesus.  What?  Fucking rich.  We were right at the fucking edge of hotness there.  It was, like, two chicks fucking amateurs at a party, they're fucking kissing, and you're  like, I don't like gay porn!  No, rich.  You like gay porn, rich?  No, I mean, not anal, but a little...  Anal's gross.  Gay porn, gay porn, gay porn stinks. 
[00:50:30]  It's funny.  I'll tell you why it sucks.  Gay guys...  Gay guys...  Guys, exactly.  You ever watch fucking, like, a girl sucking a cock?  She's actually performing.  She's licking it and looking and sucking.  And gay guys just blow each other to cum.  And they're just hammering it in his mouth and doing the exact technique that should be  done to make somebody cum.  Girls are licking it, taking it out, sucking on a nut, making it sexy.  Yeah.  Gay guys are just like... 
[00:51:00]  Look at Bobby's face.  Can I tell you the greatest sounds I've ever heard.  I got to have Kazaas somewhere, and I might still have it on an old hard drive.  It was...  There was two biker dudes, and one dude is shitting in the other dude's mouth.  But the sound is...  It's the fuck...  I have to get it for the radio, because the sound is like...  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  It was so...  It was like...  It was...  The one guy was sitting on the edge of something.  Get the fuck out of here.  It's almost like the other guy's laying under him, and it was such a long coil shit. 
[00:51:30]  It was like...  Oh.  Oh.  It was like...  It's the sounds of it.  It's all you'll want to hear in your replay machine.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Let's go to Mike in...  Jesus Christ.  Let's go to Mike in New York City.  Mike, what's up?  Wonderful.  Mike, how are you doing?  Hey.  Yeah, I was the guy that called up a couple weeks ago with the orgy story with the bride.  The what story?  The orgy story with the bride, could be.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, so as I'm telling all my friends, like, why wouldn't I?  There are all a bunch of people saying that I'm gay because I'm around my buddy because  his cock is out.  And I'm pretty much saying is, all right, when you're watching porno, don't you see  a cock there?  All right, no, if you're lucky.  Easy boss.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's porno.  A lot of guys would say it's gay.  A lot of guys say it's not.  It's not gay.  Me and my friends used to jerk off together.  That's gay.  That's gay.  That's not gay when you're just two guys in a room when you're young.  I talked about this on the radio before. 
[00:52:30]  That's not gay.  How old were you?  Huh?  32?  No.  I don't know.  We were like 16 or 17.  I don't fucking know.  He's a little old.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  It's not experimenting anymore.  The only time, me and Voss jerked off one time, but it was a girl in between us, and  then she got up for a second, and I'm laying on the bed, and there's like a girl's face  in between us.  Then she came back.  And Voss was so funny that day, because I think I told this story, but he goes, he  looks up a coin, whoever loses has to fuck her.  And you said this in front of us. 
[00:53:00]  To her!  Yeah.  That's the beauty of that.  Well, but he came first, of course.  And there was cat shit in the bathroom, and he must have smelled it when he walked in.  I'm trying to jerk off, and I hear, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,  Wait, wait, me and, also, this is what I was hoping we were going to get to, by the way,  the Rich Voss, Jim Norton sex stories.  Well, we got tons of sex stories.  But the one time, we got tons of them.  The one time, I was fucking, this hot girl, I met her outside the cellar, she was like  20, and I'm, and I'm driving, we're going, we're, Norton's driving us back to, wherever, 
[00:53:30]  my car.  Oh, yeah.  And she's blowing me in the back of the car, and he's, all I could see was his beady eyes  in the mirror, right?  So we go back to his house, right?  And she's, and she don't really, no one ever wants anything to do with him when they're  with me.  You know what I mean?  So, he was like, she's blowing me, and he's like, ah, ah, ah, touching her.  He jacked off, right?  And I swear to God, his load hit himself in the face. 
[00:54:00]  I'm sitting next to him, and he's laying on the couch, and, and, and then we made her  sign something like, did you have a good time, remember?  Oh, my gosh.  Do you remember, do you remember the time the girl, I almost made the girl puke with my  asshole?  I also remember that.  Would you take your shirt off?  Hold on.  Why are you asking Jimmy if he remembers that?  We were together.  We got this chick a long time ago, and we went back to his place, and we, he already did  his thing.  So I got her, and I made her eat, I made her want her to eat my ass and blow me. 
[00:54:30]  So, but I, there was, he was in the other room.  I was in a hallway.  So I just took my pants off, and I still had my dirty, hot socks on, because we just did  like three shows.  So I was just, my balls were all hot.  Sweaty and all.  And she, she was lying on the floor, and, and then she got up on her, I don't know, she  on her fucking, on her bum, and just started eating my ass out.  And this is, all Jimmy heard from the other room was, oh.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, when? 
[00:55:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  It was in the hallway of my apartment.  There's sunflower seeds up your ass.  Remember the, like, a fucking pitcher.  I had, I had dust bunnies in my asshole.  Remember the four and the two I brought back to the hotel room?  Oh, the one was getting married with the bad teeth?  No, the four and the two?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  One was a four, and then one was so fucking horrendous.  And Jimmy, he's begging her.  One meter or two, that she had all her female parts? 
[00:55:30]  It was, these were the ugliest.  I met him at Caroline's.  She had a blouse on from Marshall's?  And it was fucking horrific.  And I called Norton, he was doing Dangerfields, and I was at Caroline's.  I got these two broads, and we go back to this fucking, they have a hotel room at the  fucking Marriott, and this girl's blowing me in the bathroom, and he's begging the two,  telling the two that he just got out of rehab or whatever.  Was I?  Yeah, yeah.  He would get lying.  I was in rehab.  I haven't been with a girl in a long time.  And she just, no.  You're working a four.  That's awesome.  And then the four, the four blew me, was eating my ass out and stuff, and I talked her 
[00:56:00]  into blowing Jimmy, right?  And then we're leaving, and I go, she blew you?  He goes, yeah.  I go, did you make out with her?  He goes, just a little.  I go, well, she just ate my ass.  I was making out with her in the bathroom, and I didn't know.  She had eaten his ass.  Oh, fuck.  It would have been better if you didn't give away the ass-eating in the setup.  Yeah.  You should have said she blew you.  Oh, shit.  That's better.  That's all right.  It's still effective. 
[00:56:30]  It's still effective.  I just caught that.  Yeah, it still leaves a bit.  He's in your mouth.  I try to get a wait.  We were on the road, and didn't I, like, fucking try to get a waitress to go in a closet with  you somewhere?  Yeah, you're like, just look at his cock.  Just look at his cock.  He's got a big dick.  Just look at his dick.  He's trying to get a waitress to go in a closet.  I used to brag about his dick to other girls to try to get them in the fucking bathroom  with me.  Oh, God, yeah.  I think that's why, like, I'm friends with all you guys, but I never have taken that last  step to be close friends with you guys, because I've seen enough.  I've seen Jimmy's cock.  You can't be a friend of Jimmy's until you've seen his cock. 
[00:57:00]  I've watched Vos make out with a grandmother.  Me and Bobby don't really have, you know, we're still getting to know each other.  But just when it comes time to make that final, like, step to be close friends, yeah, we're  driving through Times Square to drop around by the poor authorities so she can take a 12-hour  bus back home.  Yeah, she had to go to Cleveland.  She was sexy, and she's blowing me, and he's in the backseat peeking.  Oh, shit.  Wonderful.  Oh, man.  No, you know what?  I had a blow.  I have no problem you saying that I was peeking, all right?  I have no problem with that.  Yeah, pretty much.  But what really happened was you got my attention, and then you're taking the rear-view mirror 
[00:57:30]  and fucking making the angle perfect for me.  Of course.  Helping a friend out.  That fucking Latin broad, I don't want to say her name, that I was going out with, was  so fucking hot, man.  I jerked off one time, and I had just come into the city after I jerked off, and the chick  you see was sucking his dick in the car.  So I sat in the backseat, and my dick was like a fucking root.  I'm just trying to jerk off, and she was grabbing it, too.  Really?  She was?  Yeah, I think so.  I hope so.  Maybe she was watching.  I was just watching. 
[00:58:00]  What the fuck is with these guys?  She was so fucking hot.  Jesus Christ, will you stop pretending I'm not here?  You just threw trash at me.  I want to hear this.  It's so into your stupid story.  You just, yeah, fucking...  We're throwing trash.  It's hitting Bobby in the head.  What's wrong with you?  You fucking creep.  He thought he was at SeaWorld.  Hey, uh...  We're getting...  You know what?  That's pretty fucking funny.  That was pretty good.  You know, it's been a while.  Joe in Vegas is requesting the famous Central Park story.  Oh.  Can I tell it from the beginning?  Want me to tell... 
[00:58:30]  Real quick?  No, you don't have to be quick.  This is a great story.  God.  There's a lot of new listeners that haven't heard this one yet.  This is one of their classics.  We were coming out of somewhere, and it's hot...  I mean, it's Blackjack.  We were walking by SOBs on Houston.  Yeah, and it's Blackjack.  What's SOBs?  It's the club.  Not that it matters.  Okay.  It's Blackjack, and she was like a nine, right?  Yeah, yeah.  And it came up to me and goes, oh, she knew me from comedy, like B-T or one of those shows.  Boston Comedy Club.  What?  What's it?  Boston?  Hot.  Yeah, that's just like a big TV show.  Well, no, whatever. 
[00:59:00]  Because she was like, I don't know what to be from.  She knew a TV show.  Whatever.  Death Jam.  It was either Death Jam or a local comedy club.  I'm not sure how she recognized me.  What?  That doesn't matter, okay?  I'm sorry.  I'm very recognizable.  You're right.  You're right.  All right.  Jesus Christ.  I'm admitting fault.  You're right.  All right.  Go ahead.  So she goes, we go, you want to hang out?  We went and got bagels.  And down we go.  We were planning to go to the Pete booths already, but we were hungry.  Maybe we weren't even going to go get bagels, but we couldn't say you want to go straight  to the Pete booths.  We go, let's go eat.  No, we went to a bagel place that was right by the booth. 
[00:59:30]  The booth was on 54th, right up Broadway.  So we went to that bagel place right there so we could just segue.  Let's go to the booth.  We're right here.  Put fucking bagels on your cocks.  And then fucking blew each other and ate bagels at the same time.  But wait a minute.  So then we went to the Pete booths together?  Not in the same booth.  Well, I brought her into the booth with me and they kicked me out.  The Indian guys go, you know, they kicked us out of the booth.  They do.  And then we're standing on Broadway right across from the Letterman's. 
[01:00:00]  Ben Sullivan Theater.  Ben Sullivan Theater.  God, could you tell the story, please?  Will you calm down?  I'm sorry.  Oh, there you are.  So I'm making out with her and I got my hand under her dress.  She has like one of these slip dresses that, you know, you tie.  And I'm fingering her right on Broadway.  Great description of a dress.  I'm fingering her.  And as I'm fingering her, Norton's standing behind her just squeezing her butt.  With that Norton face when he's getting dirty.  So I fingered her and she came. 
[01:00:30]  She came right on Broadway.  So then we get in the car and we drive her out and we go up to Central Park.  Right?  Norton looks at his false teeth when he's getting really turned on.  He just sucks his top lip in.  His top lip goes in.  He crinkles his nose.  Yeah, his nose comes over his upper lip.  And then his eyes squint and he gets that little angry brow.  I'm going to fucking kill somebody.  Wait, did I squat behind her too?  I think I squatted behind her.  On the fucking...  On Broadway.  Yeah, on Broadway.  You're squatting on your knees, grabbing her...  This is 1968? 
[01:01:00]  What?  Who the fuck does that now?  How could you even get away with that?  It was between a newspaper stand and a car.  Yeah.  It was dark related.  Oh, well.  Go ahead.  You can tell the rest.  Oh, God.  So then we drive around and we go up to Central Park and we park on the east side.  There's a little wall there.  Mm-hmm.  And we climb over the wall.  And we go down into, like, the fucking woods of Central Park.  And she is fucking hot.  And then she starts blowing me.  Right?  She's on her. 
[01:01:30]  She's on her.  She's blowing me.  She's standing.  She's fucking cruising with Al Pacino.  She's blowing me.  And then I look down.  Wait, she was standing and blowing you?  She bent over.  No, bent over.  Bent over.  You know, like that.  I forgot to tell her she was a midget.  And then, uh...  She was young.  I was the only midget in the story.  And then she bent over, blowing me.  And I look down and Norton is eating her ass.  Like it's candy.  I see his face eating her.  Like, you know, I wasn't really into it. 
[01:02:00]  And then I look and I go, he's just eating this strange girl's ass.  Right?  Right in there.  Right?  I mean, a girl we picked up walking down the street.  Okay?  Wow.  And he's got his face in there like candy.  And it's buried in there.  Right?  There's a little tongue coming on.  How was it?  Huh?  How was it, Jim?  It was nice.  Nice dumper.  Did she have any roids?  No, I don't remember.  It was dark.  Was it, was her ass?  No, that was her ass.  You went in there, like, without any visual assessment of the target. 
[01:02:30]  I was like a tunnel rat in the arm.  Not knowing what's around that corner.  Did you feel any wrinkles with your tongue?  No, she was young.  This girl was tight, man.  This girl was fucking smoking.  I don't know if she blew you.  Did she blow you after?  Yeah, but my dick was kind of half in and out, so I had to jerk off when she was going to  lick my balls or something.  She hated it.  She didn't want any part of me.  She was just doing it for him.  And I ate her ass, so she probably felt somewhat obligated.  It's like when you let a salesman in the house, she was like, I'm going to get something.  All right.  I'm going to buy something.  What's the cheapest thing you got for sale? 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, shit.  Fuck shit.  So then we're driving home, right?  And he just ate her ass, and I said to him, I go, did you have a good time?  He goes, yeah, it was kind of fun, but I was a little uncomfortable because I don't want  to get my pants dirty kneeling down.  I go, but you'll eat a strange girl's ass, and you're worried about grass stains?  Grass stains on the knees of your pants.  And you just rush over things.  He tells the story badly.  He gives it away.  Not that it's a big secret, but from what I remember, I'm like, yeah, my legs are really  sore.  You're like, wow. 
[01:03:30]  I'm like, I was squatting down.  I didn't want to kneel on the grass and get my pants dirty.  You just rushed right to it.  He was holding your ass.  You reiterated that like we got it.  Okay, but here's the thing.  I explained it perfectly.  You were on the ground.  You don't want to get your pants dirty.  I just want to apologize for my fucking slow, drawn-out Guatemalan story now, because now  I know what it feels like to you guys.  I just feel like shit.  You know when something happens to you, and you're like, well, fuck, I feel bad.  You know what?  The radio show can get very uncomfortable when those stories are going slow. 
[01:04:00]  Opie laughed through this story.  I like the story.  I know, so why is he apologizing for our story?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Because you weren't involved in it?  Sorry.  Because he was making it.  We're not an improv team, asshole.  I know.  You don't care.  You're your own improv team.  Okay?  You're one letter short of fucking improv.  Improve?  Nothing?  No, that would be improv.  You're one letter short of improv.  Improv.  Or you're a prov.  That stunk on so many different fucking levels. 
[01:04:30]  It stinks, man.  So when you got home, and you were living with your mom at the time.  He gets so mad.  Who?  Who?  Why are you getting mad?  I don't know.  I'm talking to him now.  I'm asking about the Central Park.  When you got home, because you were living with your mom, and she did your laundry and  saw grass stains, and she'd say, were you eating ass again?  No, I didn't.  See, that's the whole thing.  He never got the grass stains.  That's right.  Right.  So why would that...  That's a funny joke if we pretend he had grass stains.  Yeah.  We already...  Let's pretend.  Let's pretend.  Just a little suspend.  We already acknowledged that he didn't have grass stains.  This isn't the fucking Carol Burnett show. 
[01:05:00]  Who's Carol Burnett?  Who's that?  Is that Carol Burnett's...  Carol Burnett?  Again, what?  Is that Carol Burnett's what?  You said what?  Is that her what?  What?  Is that her what?  What?  You said, is that her what?  I'm waiting to hear your joke.  Come on.  I don't have one.  Well, then fucking shit your face.  Is that it for the sex stories?  You want to share one more?  I don't know if we have any more.  You don't have any sex stories with your friends where you fucked a bunch of chicks?  With other guys?  I swear to God. 
[01:05:30]  What about you, Anthony?  Nothing?  I actually...  You and your brother never fucking just railed somebody.  Actually, I watched a train once at the fraternity house, but...  Yeah?  That's the first time I got laid was from a train.  The first time I had sex in my life...  I'll tell you this real quick.  Let me...  One guy's in front and one in the mouth?  We're staying in...  We're staying down until we're 17 or 18.  We're staying in Seaside.  It was fucking...  It was 4th of July weekend.  Watch your language.  So we went to some shit hotel that we go to, and it was two beds.  It was me and my friend Brian. 
[01:06:00]  So the lady said, listen, I'm going to rent you guys a bed, and I'm going to rent the  other bed to other kids.  And we go, no other fucking kids...  No, the story.  Did I tell the story?  I don't think I told...  No, I'm just like...  He goes...  There comes another story from Fox.  I go, no other kids are going to rent the room since we already have it.  So we go, okay, we'll take it.  So we took the fucking room.  We go to the ball walk, come back.  She rented the bed and the floor to five other guys.  So now we got seven guys in our room that we don't even know.  Why are you screaming at her?  Huh?  Because we have fucking...  It's 4th of July weekend.  That's the deal. 
[01:06:30]  So I come back to the room.  I come back to the room, and one of the guys is fucking this broad.  This is the first time I got laid in my life.  He's fucking this broad.  But I go, can I do that?  I mean, can I have some?  And he goes...  And so I started fucking, and when he was done, I came like...  It was just a fat, semi-fat girl, and I came so quick.  And then I walk out the door, and there was a line down the fucking hallway.  And my friend Brian, he was like six on line.  Dude, that's how it was at the fraternity house. 
[01:07:00]  They put a keg outside the door.  This girl, there was a whole line of guys just in their underpants waiting, and it was  like our sister sorority.  And the next day, we're having like a beer social at this bar, and she's there just hanging  out like nothing happened.  I used to do that.  I couldn't fucking believe it.  We used to do that with a crazy lady, Connie.  She was around 34, and we used to all fucking just take her to the park and fucking come  on her.  I swear to God.  And then there was another crazy guy, this other dude who was just out of his mind.  We'd make them fuck. 
[01:07:30]  He used to just love Ozzy, but he lost his mind.  He'd just go, Ozzy!  And he'd just make the devil horns, and he was just a fucking lunatic.  And you fucked him, too?  And we used to make her fuck him, and he'd just be on top going, Ozzy!  And she'd be like, is he all right?  Is he all right?  Is this okay?  Is this all right?  And she'd just repeat herself, just two fucking maniacs fucking each other.  And you guys laughing.  There was one lady.  Hold on, I got to call a timeout.  A lot of people are asking if you said maternity house instead of fraternity house. 
[01:08:00]  No, I didn't say maternity.  I don't think I did.  I'm sure I could.  Will you go back over that, please?  I'm going to be listening to the replay later.  Can they check that?  That would be hilarious.  Can they run tape, please?  At the maternity house.  At the maternity house.  If you do say that, I'm breaking this microphone over your head.  That's why I don't like when women actually shoot, like they come, it grosses me out, because  that fucking crazy broad we used to fuck, we were fucking on an abandoned school bus  one day, like six dudes banged her. 
[01:08:30]  I was the last one, and I was fucking her standing up, and her pussy just emptied on  me, and I fucking, and it came out like somebody actually turned on a faucet in their uterus.  It just went, and came out like water all over me.  Fucking bisque.  Do you know that there are guys, guys like cuckolds and shit, that's called a cream pie,  there are guys that would love to lay under that and take the whole thing in their mouth?  God damn it.  It came out with cream pie?  No, dude. 
[01:09:00]  It fucking, and that's why I don't like, I don't like, I don't really want to find my  chick's G-spot, I don't want her to come, I just want it all inside, no, I don't want  to fucking see a fucking dribble out like somebody just poured tapioca on my fucking  cock.  You don't like your girl to squirt in your mouth?  No.  Who the fuck knows?  Remember that squirter we had with Big A?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That girl was, she could just squirt at will.  I don't know, it looked like she was peeing.  I don't know, I don't know.  Was it real, Jimmy? 
[01:09:30]  It kind of looked like, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, like spray paint, and Big A was  just right there.  She was airbrushing her pants.  She was doing it to his face, yeah.  I had to go leaving puddles on the floor, me and my friend was banging her and her friend.  Man, fuck that, just, oh, shit.  I'm showing cocaine.  What happened?  What happened?  Oh, I'm sorry, nothing, that just came out.  Don't listen to me, I'm fucking stupid.  You derailed us for a second there.  I did, I have nothing.  I thought something happened.  First thought it was going to be the beating.  No, no.  First time I, whatever, had a Hillary Clinton type of joke. 
[01:10:00]  I fucking.  I didn't have completely organized in my head.  I don't like that fucking load when women drop loads.  That's just gross to me.  Would you let a couple, would you mind if like four or five guys spot the chick, and  then she put a pussy in your mouth and squeezed it into your throat?  Oh, yeah.  Like a giant oyster.  Like toothpaste?  Her clit was just like a thumb, just all swollen.  Then you get her pussy opened up, like fucking, like, like predator's face.  This is going to discharge.  Oh, it comes out like coffee grounds. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, grinds.  Oh, well.  I think this, I think this train's out of gas.  I know.  I'm kidding.  Yeah.  The old fuck.  We made it to the station.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Thank God.  No, we didn't, but they had to get off and walk, but it's not far.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's not far.  No, and nobody, nobody is helped.  Oh, fuck enough.  Nothing has changed.  Uh, Fozzie, uh, Fozzie Bear from, uh, Cow Hampshire, he writes, if you guys ever talk 
[01:11:00]  to Crash from the Toucher and Rich show, ask him about the homeless McDonald's girl  who used to hide in his mom's house.  Pretty fucked up shit.  Hmm.  We're going to have to get that story on the air, maybe tomorrow.  I hit a chick in my basement once.  I told you that.  Oh, yeah.  Hit her there?  No, I hit, yeah, the retarded chick used to follow me home all the time, so one time  I let her in because my mom wasn't home, and I took her in the basement, and she jerked  me off with lava soap.  That's got abrasive in it, right?  Just fucking hard.  Yeah.  And then my mother and aunt came home, I saw the car pull up, so I left her down there,  I went upstairs, and I fell asleep on the couch until like 8.30. 
[01:11:30]  For 22 years.  Dude, I came back, it was the saddest thing ever.  I opened the tornado doors we had in the back.  How many hours?  It had to be, we got home probably around 2.30.  Six hours?  I went back at 8.30 at night, and it was kind of, I think it was like almost spring, so  it was still cold and windy, and I opened those tornado doors, and just a shivering fucking  retard.  She still had the soap on her hand, though.  She didn't wash the soap.  She still had the little wind.  And I was like, get the fuck out. 
[01:12:00]  Go, go.  I used to put a mattress in the garage, so my roommates wouldn't see me fucking like fat  girls.  I had a mattress in the garage.  Dude, I had a fat chick one time.  I used to, I put pillows over her whole body, so I would just see her head blowing me.  You know how some girls tell that story about you right now?  I know.  And then all of a sudden, there's a retarded guy who opened the storm drain.  Yeah, we used to, I used to sneak these fucking pills.  I could never fuck fatties.  Oh, I fucked a bunch of fat chicks. 
[01:12:30]  I only fucked one.  I fucked a fat chick once, and we were, I promised to.  You fucked one of the one, you had a mattress in the garage.  I fucking, I said how many times I fucked her.  I promised, I promised this girl a steak and cheese to get her to blow me.  And after she blew me, she wouldn't leave until I bought her the steak and cheese.  She was sitting around.  I go, I'm like, all right.  She's like, yeah, where are you going to get that steak and cheese from?  I'm like, all right.  Well, I'll give you the fucking, she ate it watching TV with her fat gut out. 
[01:13:00]  As soon as she was done dipping her fries, she, she left.  She goes, all right, I'll see you later.  When I was in Vegas, I went down to get an English muffin and I went down to get eggs.  And the girl goes, if you get me an English muffin, you can fuck me in the ass.  Jesus Christ.  I had to go for a muffin.  Jesus, I would have got you in anyhow.  You're in my bed.  Hey, hey, hey, go and join.  This is the worst OPN3.  Sirius XM.

[01:17:30]  What is going on?  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  My name is Iraq, and, you know, I do hear from you time to time on the Twitter, on the Facebook,  however else you contact the show, whether we're listening to you or not, there's another story.  But when we do listen to you, I do hear some suggestions of stuff to be played on Worst Of,  and a lot of you just love fighting.  It doesn't matter who it's with, what it's about, or what the results are. 
[01:18:00]  You just love to hear a fight, especially a fight involving staff members of our show.  Well, I'll do you one better.  Staff members of our show and the Ron and Fez show dug back into 2007 for this one.  It's Roland vs. Eastside Dave on the Worst of Opie and Anthony.  This is the Worst of the Opie and Anthony show on Sirius XM.  Oh, there was, I heard, I heard there's something going on.  Yeah, what's this deal about?  I didn't, I didn't get to hear Ron and Fez last, uh, yesterday.  I was a little tired.  Paul, oh, called up. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  Like he usually does.  He's going to talk about films.  Okay.  And then just started bad-mouthing Roland about, uh, how he's not a film reviewer.  Okay.  Uh, he, he doesn't know about the films.  He wasn't able to convey what the, the storylines were.  Okay.  So I'd agree with him.  Uh, you're not a film reviewer, but, but Ronnie was saying, well, he seems to see a lot of  movies, which you do.  Would that be Ron and Fez noon to three?  Of course.  Okay. 
[01:19:00]  He's going to kill you.  Ron and Fez featuring Lily.  Whoa.  That's actually the, what they want to change the name of the show to.  Really?  Featuring Lily?  Featuring Lily.  That's nice.  With a dash after featuring.  She's a nice gal.  A gal.  Roland?  Yes.  Yes.  Do my, yes, Roland.  Hello, Roland.  All right.  Roland, so, Paul O is known for, uh, known a little bit about movies on the Ron and Fez  show.  Yeah.  Apparently.  And I do believe he sees more movies than you do. 
[01:19:30]  Not really, though.  He said he goes, he tries to see.  I don't think he does either.  Oh, really?  No, I think Roland sees more movies.  I think Paul O is a liar.  I think he's like a compulsive liar.  Yeah, because he's not invited to Junkins anymore, so that means he pissed off a lot of  people.  Well, I don't think he was really going to that many, anyway.  Yeah, he lies a lot to make himself appear to be better than he is.  Yeah, bigger and better than he is.  He's shit on a stick, Roland.  But unlike you, he gives Ron and Fez great radio, I gotta tell you.  Oh.  Oh.  Roland gives us great radio.  Not really. 
[01:20:00]  Well, all right.  Every once in a while.  Right?  See, they're in agreement out there.  They're just embarrassed for Roland.  I think you do great, Roland.  Well, Paul O does things that, you know, you would never do.  Like what?  Put a jacket on?  Remember.  Remember that time when...  Do you remember?  He licked Sandy Kane's herpy growth or whatever the hell that was.  Licked their fucking genital wart.  Genital wart.  And then he...  Didn't he shit in a pool? 
[01:20:30]  In a pool.  Would you ever shit in a kiddie's pool?  No, I'll shit on Earl's desk right now.  You would?  Yeah.  No, you won't.  Well, once I have to get shit, I'll do it tomorrow.  Oh, well.  Well, he should now.  No action.  I said in 24 hours away, go shit on his desk right now.  Yeah, Roland.  I think everyone pooed earlier this morning.  So go poo again.  Wow, you're crazy.  Ooh.  If he had to shit, he would shit on Earl's desk, everyone.  Ooh.  Watch out for Roland.  He's unstoppable.  Come on, Roland.  Go over there and shit on Earl's desk.  Go ahead.  Be the most productive thing on that desk in a long time. 
[01:21:00]  Pop out a nugget right now.  I'll try.  How about this?  All right, get a microphone.  Let's see if he can at least try.  Pull down your pants.  I don't have to go now.  Put an asshole print on his phone.  Mark.  How about rub his phone on your ball-banging asshole?  And rumor has it that Paolo wants to fight Roland.  I heard that he wants to fight me in February.  What?  February.  For what?  I don't know when his shitty movie comes out, apparently.  Oh, his movie? 
[01:21:30]  Is that the one that, like...  They're not still acknowledging that he's in.  No filter Paul is in?  They're not acknowledging this movie still.  Oh, my God.  What's it called?  Attack of the Shrunken Heads?  What's it called?  What's his movie called?  I think it's called Gap.  Oh, Gap.  This movie's called Gap.  What's it?  No, Roland was extremely pissed yesterday when he started hearing this stuff on Rod and Fez.  He texted me after I told him what was happening and said,  Paolo can suck my cock, and Dave, the WGA member, crossed the line. 
[01:22:00]  What an asshole.  Because he's part of the member, and he wrote a song about me.  So technically, he broke the WGA rules.  What was the song about you?  What is this gang talk?  What?  He's talking about the Writer's Guild.  The Writer's Guild.  Because he said he's part of the WGA.  Oh, really?  Well, here's some audio from yesterday.  This is Paolo hating on Roland.  Hey, Paolo.  How are you, buddy?  Hey, Paolo.  How are you doing?  Yeah, this Roland guy is... 
[01:22:30]  I mean, I know movie critics are basically assholes to begin with, and, you know...  But, I mean, he's got to be the absolute bottom of the barrel.  Well, I don't know if Roland's really a movie critic.  He's a guy who enjoys film.  I mean, you know, okay.  People have called me a lot of things over the years, but I'm a big, strapping guy.  I can beat the crap out of any movie reviewer in the country.  And this guy is, you know, he's a Truman Capote wannabe.  I mean, he can barely talk.  But who else is...  What other movie critic looks like they could fight?  Roger Ebert don't even have a voice box anymore. 
[01:23:00]  Well, you know, I don't understand why Roland has to go and steal Paolo's bit.  Paolo always does his end-of-the-year top ten.  Roland does...  Every critic does an end-of-the-year top ten.  But Paolo does it on 202.  Right.  He's been doing it for years.  He's been doing it on the Ron Fez program.  But not on ONA's program.  It's a totally different show.  There you go.  Roland, what do you have to say about that?  Let's see what you got.  Paolo is calling you out.  Well, I'm not a movie reviewer.  That's what I never claimed to be.  Yeah, see?  That's just it. 
[01:23:30]  He never claimed to be a movie reviewer.  And Paolo is a fucking wannabe stunt guy for the radio show.  He used to do all kinds of stunts.  He's got tattoos all over himself for losing stupid bets.  He's just an ass.  What else was he going to do with that body, though?  Oh, what a disaster.  Let's be honest.  He's got this over-inflated self-worth.  Yeah.  He thinks he's making a movie?  Yeah.  What is this movie Gap about?  I just heard little bits and pieces that it was filmed in, like, three hours. 
[01:24:00]  Well, No Filter Paul is in it.  No Filter Paul is in it.  So it's about what's between his ears.  A Gap.  Get it?  It's like my father would say,  Use your head for something besides a hat rack.  Oh, that's telling you.  All right.  Let's move on.  Now, Roland, Paolo's getting pretty down and dirty here.  He's calling you gay in this next clip.  Roland is the movie critic slash stuntman who, I hate to say it, Paolo, has replaced you. 
[01:24:30]  First of all, he's not a stuntman.  He's like the marshmallow Stay Puft guy.  He's like...  Good one.  He's awesome.  When they were talking to me the other day, they asked him outright,  Are you gay?  I mean, because if you have a gay voice, and then you're going to pretend not to be gay,  I mean, there's nothing wrong with being a gay and having a gay voice,  but you're going to go in there with that gay voice and then say,  Oh, no, I love...  I don't like cock.  I mean, he literally said, I don't...  He's...  That's it.  That's the end of the clip.  What happened?  Alan Fez's act. 
[01:25:00]  Paolo's a man's man.  Always has been.  He's nothing but butch.  And Roland just is...  He's tubby.  He's got a bad hairline.  Paolo's got a beautiful...  Why are you guys fucking beating up on him?  Because...  You're trying to be all on a juniors?  He gets enough trouble on his own show.  We don't like him taking over Paolo's turf.  He's not a stuntman.  I could smack the shit out of him first.  I don't even think you could beat him in a fight.  That's it?  Okay.  Fight?  You want to fight Paolo?  You want to fight him?  Well, what do you have to say for yourself? 
[01:25:30]  You wouldn't have to fight.  I don't know who Paolo is.  First of all, Paolo sounds gayer than Roland.  Yeah.  He always has.  Yeah.  I mean, we know he was married at one point.  Yeah.  That went horribly wrong, as was documented on the Ron and Fez program.  Some of the best radio ever, by the way.  Oh, Jesus.  Unbelievable.  Roland, would you like to, you know, maybe, I don't know, do some mud wrestling with Paolo?  So you want to sexy it up, is what you're saying.  Yeah, well, yeah.  I'm mud wrestling.  I figured I'd do both these guys a favor. 
[01:26:00]  No.  Uh, maybe jello wrestling?  Hot oil wrestling?  Something without food products.  Oh, you don't like the whole getting food on you?  All right, so how about mud?  You like getting food in you.  Well.  How about cinnamon wrestling?  You guys roll around in a big vat of powdered cinnamon.  Here's someone that doesn't know much about me.  Oh, my mom.  I hear Poe, um, in the background.  That's my freaking phone ring, but I want the Drew Boogie new thing. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, that's a good one.  I don't think I need to put that on here.  You specifically said you wanted it.  I sure did.  I want the, the thing.  All right.  So, uh, where we at?  It seems to be on February when his movie's in the film festival, whichever film festival.  His movie's not going to be, what film festival?  That's what he claims.  He's always claiming this stuff.  God, is he a disaster.  What film festival?  There isn't a film festival in February.  He's screaming at me.  So, uh, Roland, this, uh, this, this, this bit is taking off. 
[01:27:00]  You and Paulo, it's just amazing.  I know.  Um, so he's calling you gay.  What do you have to say about that?  Yeah.  I'm not gay.  Oh, of course not.  You don't like, you don't like cock, right?  I don't.  I don't.  You think it's okay?  What?  Cock.  Cock is okay.  What do you like about cock?  Yeah.  What are the things you like about cock?  If you had to pick one.  Out of the long list. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, man.  What the fuck is with this show?  The shaft or the balls?  Neither.  Like, when you, this is not even to be gay.  Yeah.  But, do you like to grip or to glide the hand up and down?  Hmm.  I don't know.  I guess glide.  A glide?  That's cool.  Works with the mouth.  Good boy.  What kind of an asshole do you like?  A clean one? 
[01:28:00]  I don't know.  What are you?  I don't know.  What's wrong with you?  Why are you answering this?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  All right.  Paulo challenge is rolling in this next clip.  This, uh, this bit is just, wow.  Oh, the shelf life on this one is going to be unbelievable.  It's off the hook, yo.  Off the hook, yo.  Yes.  Hit it.  You know, I mean, I'll take a punch any day of the week.  That's right.  Sure, I will do that.  So, what do you want to do?  Get in the ring with Roland?  I'll get in the ring with 20 Rolands.  I can't get 19 other Rolands.  I hope not.  You can get a clothing machine. 
[01:28:30]  I'll be up there in New York in February around Oscar time.  I'm going to try and get my movie screen and all of that.  You set it up for a review for Roland to watch it.  Absolutely.  All right.  So, this is the challenge.  You want him to climb in the ring.  You know, we got enough room in this studio to set up a ring.  We do an Afro show and we let these guys go at it.  Well, I'm just saying, I'll be up there in February.  Anybody who's got a fucking problem with me, I'll fucking take care of them.  All right, big guy. 
[01:29:00]  All right.  Easy.  He's gotten really angry.  Yeah.  The one thing I love is like, I'll be there February around Oscar time.  My film is going to be, you know, review or submit.  What did he say?  Something like he was trying to imply that his film in some way, shape or form is connected  to the Oscars.  Like it would even be considered for anything.  What did he, what did he, what did he film it on?  Why are you acknowledging that this film exists?  Because they talk about it. 
[01:29:30]  It's and, and, uh, they got to stop.  I, I would, I would love to see it because it's gotta be God awful.  I gave up on that storyline on Rana Fez well over a year ago.  What?  The Gap?  Gap story?  There's no film.  Let's be honest.  There is a film.  No.  Stop it.  Paul was in it.  Stop.  No filter Paul.  No.  I'd love to see him acting.  Didn't he have a starring role?  Yeah, I would like to see him acting too.  What did he play?  Like a human.  Detective.  That's right.  He's on a child pornography case. 
[01:30:00]  Then he realizes it's all in a briefcase in his own house.  It's called the, I did it.  Roland, you're our guy.  What's, what's going on, man?  Paul's getting the best of you here.  He wants to fight you.  He's calling you gay.  You don't need to know this guy to give it back to him a little bit.  Give him the business, Roland.  Look at him.  Yeah.  Hey, dude with Muhammad Ali on his ass.  Let's go.  What do you got?  Talk up your shit. 
[01:30:30]  Well, can you, I don't know.  It's just easy.  Come on.  Well, what's up?  I don't know who he is.  I don't know.  He's an asshole, I guess.  All right.  That's good.  Both barrels.  Yeah.  Wow.  You don't hold anything back, do you?  No, you're shitless.  Holy shit.  Just, it's a Rana Fez.  Another bad bit they do.  I don't know.  Oh. 
[01:31:00]  Wow.  Getting on Rana Fez.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  Like, Dave's an idiot, as we all know.  I mean, I don't know.  The kind of his.  How could you call him an idiot during such a happy time in his life?  He wrote a song.  He's going to be a father.  Well, I hope this baby's a water baby.  Just announced yesterday that he's going to be a daddy.  Is he really?  Yes.  Well, I hope the kids retarded.  There you go.  Holy Jesus.  Oh, no, you didn't.  You know.  I hope the word, I lost my baby, comes in a month.  Yeah. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, my.  That's for the song.  All right.  All right.  Wow.  That is nothing.  That's why I hold my anger back.  Nothing but uncalled for.  Hey, he wrote a song about me, Dave.  Holy shit.  Yeah, but how bad was it?  What did the song say?  La, la, la.  He's got a big forehead.  That doesn't, you know, equate to wishing ill upon anybody's unborn children.  Of course.  18 years of explaining photographs.  Jesus. 
[01:32:00]  Wow.  Now are you.  That's Roland.  He's got a.  Wow.  All right.  Well, we got the Roland.  Holy mother of Christ.  I don't even know what to say after that.  Roland.  Jesus, Roland.  Didn't you realize you were just having fun?  There's radio and then there's like real life.  Yeah.  What the fuck's wrong with you?  Find the line.  So what else, Roland?  I'm not going to bail on you.  Yeah.  Jimmy's with you still.  Yeah.  What else do you wish on Eastside Dave?  Jesus.  It's not about his kid, but about him.  Let's just deal with him.  He's the total zero here.  Go to the whole family fucking mafia. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  What's wrong with you?  I know.  Why don't you give him a Colombian necktie?  Like, I don't know, I'm just, I don't know, I'm just, I don't know, because every time  I start getting angry, I'll say something that I just said.  Well, let's listen to the song and see if anything pops out of your brain.  This is Eastside Dave doing the Roland song.  The Roland song.  Rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling,  rolling, rolling, rolling, he eats corn from his colon, and that is why he has 
[01:33:00]  a rah-hide.  He has chipmunk cheeks that look swollen, and less charisma than Kyle Bolin.  Oh, that hudgy Roland has rah-hide.  He's Doritos all day Sunday, with worse hairline than Jeff and Gundy.  He weighs more than King Kong Bundy, his ass is wide.  Roland eats beef stew, Roland sips, Roland shoes, Roland barge, Roland blues, rah-hide.  Roland's bigger than a barge, man's breast, buddy's large, in the fat army, he thinks 
[01:33:30]  Sarge, he has a rah-hide.  Roland has a rah-hide.  He's got a good voice.  I don't know why you got so upset about that.  It wasn't that bad.  Still.  Still by my baby comics.  He stands by his baby comics.  How do you stand by those?  You didn't appreciate this song about you? 
[01:34:00]  No.  He'd go fuck himself.  Jesus.  Wow, I've never seen him.  Would you like to retaliate with a song of your own?  No.  You're a bad producer.  You don't know anything.  No, no, no.  I don't know about Steve, bro.  Steve, Dave.  All right, so.  You didn't appreciate Dave taking a dig at you?  No, because, I mean, they damned it, like, hey, or call me saying, hey, we're going to  talk about you.  It's just Sam texted me, he goes, turn your XM radio. 
[01:34:30]  Then they started trashing me.  The guy who's going, and then Fez going, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't feel well.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Whatever.  The stupid Earl going, hello, hello, yeah, it really does no movies.  Go fuck yourselves.  Wow.  Ow.  Yeah, hey, if you want to see guests, turn on our channel instead of begging for me.  We're on the same channel.  We're on the same channel, but basically you're bragging that you get good guests for our radio  show?  Not bragging, just one guest, Earl wanted that. 
[01:35:00]  Which one?  John C. Rally, they're claiming stuff, so.  Oh, what's the problem?  I don't know.  What's the issue there?  There seems to be a problem, because I know that he's going to be doing Ronnie's thing.  Yeah, but he's going to do our show, too.  But he's doing our show, yeah.  But is that a problem?  I don't think so.  I don't think they were too happy about it.  Why?  Who was?  I don't know.  I guess Earl wasn't, but then he goes, it was okay.  Oh, that we were going to.  But isn't it two different things? 
[01:35:30]  Ronnie does, like, his own thing.  But we got him first, though.  But it doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  We're all on the same team.  Do you, uh, what do you have to say about Black Earl?  Who's that?  Oh, her?  No, no, Earl.  Earl, not a black girl.  Oh, no, just that, you know, he just jumped on top of it and started trashing me, too.  Yeah.  He's, movies.  So what do you have to say to Earl?  Oh, nothing, though.  I don't have, like, any ill will towards Earl.  No?  No.  He wanted to shit on his desk. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, well, because just making those comments, but...  Do you have to shit?  No.  That is not an act of friendship.  What about, uh, Ron Bennington?  I like him.  I mean, he didn't trash me.  No?  No.  Just Fez, Dave, Earl.  Fez trashed you?  What did Fez say?  What did Fez say?  He said, like, you sound gay.  Well, look at the source.  I know.  That's what I said.  You know?  It's the pot calling the kettle a cocksucker. 
[01:36:30]  I just get annoyed.  That's all.  Do you have a small penis?  No.  What is that?  Where does that come from?  How big are cocky hiding down there?  Yeah, let's get into the size of your cock.  It's regular size?  What do you got going on down there?  I don't know.  Are you all balls?  What do you got?  I bet you it's six thin with hair growing up to the...  Like, almost halfway up to the trunk.  You shave down?  What do you got?  A little pattern down there?  I mean...  Or are you a hairy mess? 
[01:37:00]  I am a hairy mess.  Down there?  No, I mean, geez, look at me.  But do you shave, you know, keep it well kept?  A mangroomy?  Yeah.  I try to, but...  What?  You shave?  No, I shave my teeth.  Oh, your arms and stuff.  What, a weed whacker?  No, like Steve, too.  We're all like...  All right.  Yeah.  Well, this was just wonderful radio.  Good for Roland.  Roland's fucking not happy.  Well, we saw a side of Roland that I've never seen before.  That's right.  I do.  You know Casey's going to kick your ass now. 
[01:37:30]  You do realize you're going to get your ass kicked, so...  Oh, Dave's wife?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  It's not going to be Dave that gives you the beating.  It's going to be Casey.  And all of her friends, because she's got a lot of good friends and stuff, and...  Yeah, you're done.  You went over the line with that statement.  Yeah.  Yes.  They're going to pull the rest of your hair out.  That's fine.  And shove it down his throat.  That's fine.  Do you have any...  And then they're going to make you, like, lick a vagina.  That should have got something, the whole rumor that he might... 
[01:38:00]  No?  Fuck.  But it's just too uncomfortable.  Do you have any...  Would you like to amend any of your statements?  I apologize to Casey for making the baby comment.  Do you apologize to Dave, too?  No.  No.  Wow.  How do you apologize to one and not the other?  Yeah.  It's a mutual creation kind of a thing, you know?  It takes two.  Well, I hope the baby's like her, then Dave.  Oh, okay.  Well, that's been said 80,000 times. 
[01:38:30]  I don't think Ronnie even said that.  All right.  All right.  Gee.  Oh, boy.  This is not going to bode well.  Yeah.  Yep.  I can't wait to listen at noon.  This is an out-of-control radio war.  Radio war.  It's like rap wars, man.  Yeah, this is...  Yeah, there's going to be some gunfire.  Buck, buck.  Drive-by insulting.  This is just amazing.  This is like watching the Jets and the Dolphins play. 
[01:39:00]  It's going to be crazy.  I don't know when we all started bombing.  I know.  But, boy, are we.  Well, because, like, Roland has no energy, and he brings down everyone else's energy.  I don't know.  I like Roland's little vibe.  Go shit on Earl's desk.  Help us out.  I wish I could.  Just try to push out a nugget.  Nobody will notice.  I'll just think Earl fell asleep on it.  Wow.  I don't have anything into that.  All right.  Thank you, Earl.  There you are.  All right.  All right.  There's Roland. 
[01:39:30]  Thank you, Roland.  Defending himself today.  It's amazing.  There he goes.  He had to.  All right.  Oh, boy.  Eastside Dave's here.  Oh, Dave.  Oh, boy.  Now what?  How did this happen?  What?  Jesus, I thought the show was going to end.  Hold on.  Let me turn off my XM.  Oh, God.  How do you do this?  Okay.  A retarded...  Hold on.  Why would his mic work?  Hold on, Eastside.  This is...  Yes.  Go ahead.  A retarded baby.  A retarded baby.  Why don't you say it to his face?  Where's Roland?  Where's Master Pope? 
[01:40:00]  Where's Roland?  Get rolling in this fucking input studio right now.  First of all, I have retardation in my family.  I know that's not much of a surprise.  But nonetheless, you don't fucking wish that, Alan.  Guy, he has a baby.  Nobody.  At the initial, I said, I apologize.  Well...  You better apologize, you son of a bitch.  You better apologize before I put these fucking 24-inch pythons around your neck.  I'll tell you one thing right now.  Where's Master Pope?  He's not here today, and this is a hell of a day for him to not be here.  I'm not exactly sure if I... 
[01:40:30]  He's a big, stocky boy.  You're scared of fighting him?  No!  Like...  Oh, Jesus.  He's got him in a headlock.  He's not doing much to me.  Well, I don't know.  Oh!  His head just went into the wall.  Oh, they're brawling.  Fight on!  They're brawling.  Fight on!  Where are they?  I got his ass, though!  I can't even find them.  I got his ass!  They're moving too much.  Fight!  He's holding Roland's ass.  All right, he's back in Roland.  That's...  That's...  That's...  Roland is...  All right, all right. 
[01:41:00]  All right, all right.  They're beating the crap out of each other.  What the hell is this?  I'll catch you any time you want!  I know.  It's time to take your clothes off.  Where is he?  Why am I looking at Mark?  Hey, little bitch, I held back.  He said he held back, Eastside.  Roland's very strong.  No, I didn't want to fucking come in shooting my mouth off about Roland.  Especially on the Open Entity program, two of the four greatest hosts in the history  of radio.  But...  What about...  What about...  Jimmy's...  Jimmy's a bigger host.  Jimmy's, you know, he's a super... 
[01:41:30]  Wait a breath, little bitch.  What's that?  I had a breath.  You're a son of a bitch.  The whole point, Mr. Opie...  Hey, darling.  The whole point of this song was that fucking Roland comes in.  He's trying to take Paul from Thunder.  I hope I have a son.  I do want a son, you fat bastard.  Look at this fat fucking Jeff Van Gundy.  I'm not a brat, you dumb motherfuckers.  Go produce a show.  I'm a fetch.  Get ratings.  Go produce a show.  I get fucked with the ass by a Marty Stoudemire every night.  Let's talk about movies that hasn't been done before.  Hi! 
[01:42:00]  I'm gonna write a fucking song about people.  This is the first time you've spoken clearly in the fucking air.  Go fuck yourself.  This is the first time you've spoken with any goddamn volume in three years.  Go fuck your mom.  This is the first time you've talked without starting in seven years.  This is the first time you've talked without coffee breath in nine years.  Go see 100.  This is the first time you've spoken without coffee breath in seven years.  This is the first time you've talked without being a fucking asshole in 15 years.  This is the first time you've talked without being a fucking fucking guest in 17 years. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, look.  This is the first time you've talked about anything in 45 years.  This is the first time you've talked about anything with fucking in 45 years.  You're still a bitch.  And you're still under breath.  And I'm the fat one.  I'm out of breath.  I got passion, baby.  A passion?  Unlike you, I ain't seen it on this program.  I ain't seen it on any other program.  Oh, wow.  I went to Connecticut School Broadcasting.  You come in here.  A four-year degree.  You need your top 10.  That's Apollo gimmicks. 
[01:43:00]  My college degree costs more than yours.  What are you going to do next?  Oh, did you let me do college?  Don't you rip off Apollo in my head.  Oh, I went to L.A.  Oh, Jesus.  All right, they're backfiring.  All right, they're backfiring.  All right, Roland.  Eastside Dave's got Roland in a head.  All right, Roland is losing his fucking mind.  Roland.  Roland's ass crack is hanging out.  Look at Roland's ass crack.  Oh, Dick is on the floor.  Roland, the throng.  He puts the shot again. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, God, no.  It's the real fight.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Roland's got a paddle.  That was insane.  Roland's crazy.  We're learning that Roland is crazy.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Roland is kicking Dave's ass.  I got to say Roland is kicking Dave's ass.  Roland's kicking Dave's ass.  Who saw this coming?  Get a mic on him.  Get a mic on him.  Get a mic on him.  Where am I?  It's way too powerful.  Oh, my God.  A coffee breath. 
[01:44:00]  That's the most lethal move I've ever seen in wrestling.  Holy shit.  Oh, and he's got a breath again.  You bitch.  Coffee and semen and fucking farts.  Well, you're out of breath.  And what the fat guy's not?  Dude, you got dragon feces breath on me, man.  Yeah, for your wife.  Oh, shit.  Oh, man.  Oh, shit.  Oh, wait.  Hey, Dave.  One of the three.  One of the three.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  He did it. 
[01:44:30]  I did it.  Oh, he got the plug.  Why are you screaming about me?  Paul is going to kick your ass, baby.  Paul is going to kick your ass.  You're out of breath.  You're out of breath, Dave.  You're out of breath.  I'm not out of breath, don't be.  I'll train for a month.  This is passion.  This is why this fight's never about me.  You're just picking on, you know, fucking Bobby the Brain Heenan.  The real man is my man, Paul O.  He's going to take you down at the hard rock.  I challenge him.  I'll leave it at that.  If he'll accept.  You got to leave it at that because he kicked your ass. 
[01:45:00]  Let's be honest, Dave.  He did kind of kick your ass.  He barely got shot in.  Because Steve pulled me off.  He's a fatso.  This guy doesn't even have a hateful muscle and he just kicked your ass.  Wait for Slapbox right now.  Slapbox?  Slapbox.  Slapbox.  He's fucking, he's a fatso.  He's going to put his weight on me.  I'm going to fall to the ground.  Me, I'm in shape.  Look at this.  I'm here at 95 pounds of Twisted Irish Steer.  But you're out of breath.  Twisted Irish Steer.  Because your fat fucking stomach was on me.  People are commenting that Roland has retard strength.  I pray there's a Slapbox match. 
[01:45:30]  I'll do it tomorrow if you want.  Slapbox?  No.  I said Slapbox.  Let's go.  Hey, Slapbox, I'm done.  Oh, of course.  Because you know the speed.  Look at the moves.  All right.  All right.  Dave's moving around.  He's showing off his moves.  Look at the moves.  He's showing off his moves.  Look at that.  Yeah, that's a good move.  Look at the speed.  All right.  I can do a jumping jack.  Can you do that?  When's the last time you've seen your dick, Pudgy?  Huh?  That's what I'm about.  That's what I'm about.  I'm about.  I'm about seeing my cock.  No, I did.  Oh, no, you didn't.  Oh, man. 
[01:46:00]  I'm about seeing my penis, baby, when I piss.  That's what I'm about.  I'm about not having hair plugs like Jeff Van Gundy, either.  Wow.  Oh, that was a hair plug joke.  Wow.  Yeah.  Eastside, are you a little scared of Roland?  Slapbox!  Slapbox Roland?  Come on, let's do what I'm doing.  I'm going to go to a...  I'm going to fucking Ricky Hat in your ass.  I know he lost.  That was a bad reference.  I have to get early.  My head not thinking clear.  Where do you live, Queens?  Is that what you can afford?  Yeah, come to Queens.  Yeah.  Come to Queens.  Wow, he just made fun of where you live. 
[01:46:30]  I live in Brooklyn, you out of touch, fucking fatso.  I've lived in Brooklyn for four months.  Oh, no, I can't afford that.  I'm sorry.  Maybe in one day, I live in a place that's two blocks away from Mr. Buscemi.  Two blocks away from Mr. Turturro.  Two, one, three.  I live three blocks away from Mr. Chiamatti.  I live two foot two and a half blocks away from Mr. Ledger.  Yeah, whatever.  If you goddamn give Mr. Ledger some goddamn respect.  Are you making fun of his marriage?  You give Mr. Chiamatti some respect. 
[01:47:00]  You give fucking Mr. Turturro some goddamn respect.  My friend's manager, you dumb fuck.  Oh, yeah.  I never met them.  Oh, my friend's manager.  Did you ever hear something?  Oh, he's a friend.  He's a manager.  Man, you're a manager.  I've never heard of that.  Oh, my God, my God.  My friend's manager, Jerry Queens.  And what castle?  The fuck are you talking about?  Go fuck yourself.  Oh, that's all.  I grew up in L.A.  What's your content?  I know guys on Subway.  I know a guy at the Parker Meridian. 
[01:47:30]  I know a guy at the Big Fat Burgers.  I know a guy at the Master's Square Garden that sells peanuts.  I know a guy at the New York Yankees.  I know a guy at the parking lot, Section 4.  I know a guy at the Gwynn Reed.  I know a guy at Walgreens.  I know a guy at the parking lot.  I know a guy at the Big Fat Burger.  I know many people. 
[01:48:00]  You want to talk to me about Mr. DeVito anytime, baby?  He's a personal friend.  You want to talk to me about Mr. Bam Bam Bigelow and Mr. Craig Vigio of the fucking Houston Astros?  Come talk to me.  I'll be excited to tune in and listen to them on your show.  And check them.  I'll be so excited.  Next door to my mom.  Well, I'm sure you can get them for the bucket list on your show.  I'll be glad to tune in.  I will.  With a Sopranos tattoo on your back.  My Sopranos tattoo is for my love of the Sopranos.  Other people might think it was a lost bet.  I don't look at it like that. 
[01:48:30]  I look at the glass half full all the time.  That's what I got and you don't got.  So, passion, glory, and drive.  Paul, I'm going to kick your ass.  Success and money.  I'd rather take those two.  You take your three.  Look at the passion.  Let's see the passion, Pitsy.  Pitsy, you see the passion.  I can't, Dave.  Yeah, Pitsy, yeah.  Thanks, buddy.  I do believe.  This is a sad day for you, Dave.  I took him down in the night.  Roland kicked your ass physically.  I took him down.  And emotionally and verbally. 
[01:49:00]  Roland has been a sleeper since we've known him.  Yeah.  I've never seen him.  I thought in a verbal and physical fight, Roland would get his ass handed to him.  He fucking owned.  Oh, no.  This is a dark day.  He's strong.  Woot.  Woot.  Woot.  Woot.  Woot.  Woot.  Woot.  Woot.  Roland's a fiery Mexican.  That's right.  Keep writing him notes, too.  The fucking, the Mexican came out in him right there.  He's a Mexican.  In his pants.  It's a fried bean.  Roland doesn't have writers.  Go ahead. 
[01:49:30]  Say another line and you're not just wrote you out posted.  I did.  Let me tell you something else, too.  It just shows you.  Once you call Pitsy to write your line.  I bring other people's talent level up.  Like Bill Parcells before me.  I fucking come into town and I build up a program.  Like his Bill Parcells.  You were a bottle of shit before me.  Like the Cowboys, like the Patriots before Parcells came into town.  After me, you win championships.  I congratulate you.  But don't know, don't ever forget who fucking just birthed you right here.  You came out of my vagina, baby.  Am I retarded?  Am I retarded, too? 
[01:50:00]  Oh, no.  Maybe we'll have two retarded babies in your family.  Oh, man.  Roland's an animal.  Roland, don't pull punches.  Adeline.  What the fuck?  He doesn't fight fair.  Roland, don't pull punches.  Jesus Christ.  It's called working with Carson.  You have to defend yourself.  Johnny?  Daly?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  The other one.  Oh, my God.  I mean, I don't want to say yuck.  I don't want to.  Something doesn't tell me that you really got to kind of stick it to Carson Daly, do you? 
[01:50:30]  No.  No.  He's like a brother to me.  No.  Yeah.  You talked very clearly during that whole thing.  No, he was yelling and really angry.  Wow.  I've never seen it where Eastside Dave couldn't get a word in edgewise.  It's a sad day for Eastside Dave.  Sad day for Apollo.  Sad day for Ron Efez.  For Ron Efez.  When you threw the plug in before he was able to get it in, that is like taboo.  Yeah.  For one of their guys to come in, the first words they utter on Mike should be Ron Efez, 
[01:51:00]  12 noon.  But he slipped that one up, and then you destroyed him physically.  He thought he could charge at you against the wall.  And then verbally, you just handed him a new ass.  Right.  Yeah.

[01:56:30]  Oh, Jesus, look at that smell.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show on SiriusXM.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  My name is E-Rock, E-Rock Radio on Twitter.  And this particular bit that we're going to play here is titled Rich Voss Quiz.  Now, I should have listened to this, but I didn't.  But I assume, because it is a Rich Voss bit, that it was going to be gold.  Now, this could be the time when we quiz Rich about celebrities, if he knows who is who. 
[01:57:00]  This also could be a spelling test, it could be an intelligence test, but I can guarantee you that it will be funny.  Rich Voss, at Rich Voss on Twitter, right here for you.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show on SiriusXM.  Speaking of speaking idiot, we got a little quiz for you.  A little pop quiz, Rich.  This early?  Hope you're up for it.  Yes.  All right.  Yes, this early.  Go ahead.  We're going to find out if you're smarter than a fifth grader. 
[01:57:30]  Please, where's the fifth grader?  Huh?  Yeah, where?  Well, we don't know.  Uncle Paul.  Well, we got a test, right?  What a vera.  This is a test that a fifth grader would take, right?  Yeah.  And we hand it over to you, and you're going to answer these questions.  No problem.  Don't you think we should have a little more time for this?  Yeah, I'm going to give it to you now, and after the break, you should be done.  It's only ten questions.  You mean I have to answer them?  You're not going to ask them to answer them?  Ask them now.  You don't need to wait.  We don't need to wait.  We don't have to study this.  This is not a... 
[01:58:00]  These are all yes and no kind of answers.  All right.  Finish the following sentence, Rich.  I before E except after...  I before E except after C.  All right.  Good.  Is that right?  Yes, of course.  Yeah, but that rule doesn't always work.  I hate that rule.  It's a dumb rule.  It's like, oh, except when I'm spelling something.  Right.  Then it's wrong, and I look like an idiot.  I don't want to mislead anybody.  I'm not a great speller.  So that was...  I just don't want to mislead everybody answering that one.  I spelled my daughter's name wrong. 
[01:58:30]  I've got to change her name.  Oh, I saw Rich Voss' daughter backstage.  He was part of Dennis Leary and Friends last week.  And by the way, Rich was awesome on that stage once again.  You were great.  Had a great set.  But they went backstage and saw your baby girl and said congratulations to Bonnie, and  she's beautiful, by the way.  Your baby girl's beautiful.  Thank you.  And then I found out that he effed up her name.  What's her name?  Well, see, here's what happened.  I was looking up biblical names. 
[01:59:00]  Why?  You're not religious.  I know, but it's just good.  You're not a man of God.  How is Ezekiel?  God, he called her.  So I saw...  Well, the first name I saw was Basha, and nobody liked Basha.  Basha?  How can they?  Basha, Voss?  Well, we didn't.  I didn't name her.  Basha!  Come here, Basha!  It's right on the globe.  It's where Basha lives.  Basha. 
[01:59:30]  That's awful.  Wow.  Okay, so Reina...  So I saw Reina, and I appeared...  Reina's not bad, okay.  Reina, oh, thank you.  So it was R-E-Y-N-A.  It meant pure and clean.  A biblical pure and clean, you know, Yiddish name.  So, like, three weeks later, we had the baby, and he asked to spell the name, and I just  go R-A-Y-N-A.  So now I have a Spanish queen instead of a...  That's right.  Instead of a...  You were the first Spanish queen you've had.  So how are you supposed to spell R-A... 
[02:00:00]  Well, I spell it R-A-Y-N-A, but I've got to go change it to R-E-Y-N-A at some point.  Yeah, why don't you go do that soon?  What direction do you have to travel to go from St. Louis to Kansas City?  I don't know that one either.  This is a test that a fifth grader would take.  From St. Louis to Kansas City, you'd have to go east.  All right.  Very good.  That's one wrong.  Well, it depends.  If you're going around the world, you'd go east.  That's a long way.  What is the symbol between the parentheses called? 
[02:00:30]  It's the symbol that looks like the Procter & Gamble.  Yeah.  It means...  Or A-T-N-T.  It looks like General Mills.  It's a General Mills symbol.  Yes.  Yeah.  It's that thing in the A-T-N-T logo.  Yeah.  There's a name for that?  Yes.  The Basha.  Yeah.  What is it?  What is it called?  Well, let's go with two wrong.  I have an old layman.  He's let the pitch go by.  Ball strike on himself.  We would have accepted the and sign. 
[02:01:00]  What is it called, though?  The ampersand or whatever.  Oh, no.  A fifth grader can't say that.  At least the ones I've met.  All right.  Not bad.  Once you've met, can't even say no.  One out of three.  One out of three so far, Voss.  In dry weight, how many ounces are in a pound?  Sixteen.  There you go.  That's easy, right?  Yeah, I used to sell pot, man.  That's why he knows.  Yep.  Ask me grams, ounces.  All right.  Which of the following inventions was not invented in China? 
[02:01:30]  You got gunpowder.  You got cultured pearls.  You got kites.  And you got paper.  One of those was not invented in China.  Oh.  Gunpowder.  Gunpowder.  Cultured pearls.  Kites.  Paper.  Okay.  I think I got this one.  I know disease wouldn't be the answer.  I would have to go with... 
[02:02:00]  Wait, what?  There's a lot of disease.  How did that happen when no one even pushed a button?  I don't know.  God did it.  What are you talking about?  Disease.  It's not even one of the...  I'm trying to throw something funny.  A SARS joke or something like that.  Yeah, thank you.  I didn't get you.  That's not one of the choices.  Okay, I didn't hear the...  Gunpowder.  Paper.  Kites.  Kites like you fly a kite.  Yeah.  Are you looking at my answers over there?  I swear to God, I'm not.  I couldn't see that far anyhow.  All right.  Or what was the fourth one?  Gunpowder. 
[02:02:30]  Kites.  Paper.  Cultured pearls.  Oh, cultured pearls.  What?  That's right.  Yeah.  I just want it to be wrong.  All right.  We'll take the second half of the quiz after that.  I would have said paper.  You know, and here's another thing, too.  So, you could ask me any of these questions this weekend at the brokerage, and I guarantee  in Long Island, I won't get any of them wrong.  You really want these people to ask these questions?  At the brokerage?  No.  Are you crazy?  No.  Do you understand what our fans are capable of doing? 
[02:03:00]  You know, answering as poorly as he did.  So, I'm two out of...  What am I, two and two?  You have three right out of five.  That's not bad.  So, you're barely passing, I guess?  No.  Is 60 a passing grade?  No.  No.  That's not 60.  Oh, it is.  All right.  You're around a D right now.  We got the last five questions after the break.  Okay?  Pick it up.  Pick it up.  All right.  Here's your next question.  Are you smarter than a fifth grader, Rich Voss? 
[02:03:30]  This is a fifth grade exam.  In square inches, what is the surface area of a cube with five inch sides?  How many inches would that be in square inches?  Five times five would be 25.  All right.  Wait.  I don't even know if that's right.  That's right.  Of course it's not.  I don't know if it is.  Of course it's not right.  Wait.  No.  Oh, wait.  Five times five times five.  No, wait.  Oh, my God.  In square inches, what is the surface area of a cube with five inch sides? 
[02:04:00]  Oh, 20 inches.  How do you know how big it is, though, is square inches, you don't know how big the cube is  to begin with?  Hold on.  Five inch sides.  So you got five times five, 25, and then times that by six.  Five to the fourth power.  Oh, no, man.  That's right.  By six.  Yeah.  I thought it was like five saying it had five sides.  I thought you were saying how many square inches in a five by five inch. 
[02:04:30]  Well, that's wonderful.  Yeah, it pretty much is how many square inches of surface area on a five.  On a cube or on a five.  A cube.  On a cube.  Well, let's say it's wrong.  120.  Let's say I got it wrong.  It is wrong.  Let's say hi to Sean in North Carolina.  Go ahead, Sean.  Yeah, 141.  Boss, that's not your IQ sign.  That's your SAT score.  Hey, go, Jimmy.  Hi, sir.  Oh, sorry about that.  All right.  The next question for you, Rich Boss.  What's the answer?  It was 150.  Oh, really? 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  No fifth graders get that, right?  You have to take the 25 and then times that by six, like I said.  How do you get 25, though?  Five.  It goes five times five.  It's a five inch square on each side of the cube.  But if it's a square, why would you go five times?  Because it's five inches across and five inches down.  Oh, okay.  Five times five.  I don't know.  What fifth grader?  A fifth grader goes to, like, a men's school or something gets that right?  Yeah, I guess, Rich.  You're right.  What event took the world to the brink of World War III in 1962? 
[02:05:30]  Oh, that was the Bay of Pigs in Cuba.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  The Russian Missile Crisis.  Oh, my God.  Wait, there was no World War III.  Didn't the Russian Missile Crisis last all the way up until, like, the Cold War ended?  Wait, in 62, when Kennedy was president, what almost brought us to the brink of war, you said?  Yeah.  World War III.  Almost.  Yes.  Well, it didn't happen, so it had to be almost.  Well, it's the brink. 
[02:06:00]  I love how.  Saying it's the brink means almost.  I love how he tries to show his intelligence by going, almost, right?  Almost.  Almost to the brink.  Almost to the brink.  So, almost.  Brink, isn't that where you skate?  No, that's what you do with your eyes.  See, from Bashar's writing, Voss times dumb times ass.  It's making a little formula.  Yeah.  In 1962, what almost brought us to World War III?  It had to be the Bay of Pigs in Cuba when... 
[02:06:30]  No, it's not the Bay of Pigs.  No, it's not the Bay of Pigs.  I was born...  Okay, wait, no.  Bernie Getz, AIDS, crack, homeless vets?  No.  Five years old.  Yeah, I get it.  You were five in 62.  I think.  But, you know, you're now an adult, and you should know what happened in 62.  I know it.  In 62.  Uh-huh.  Malcolm or one of them, they weren't shooting...  No, that...  How would that be World War III?  Malcolm in the middle?  Malcolm wasn't assassinated by a Russian. 
[02:07:00]  All right, what do you got?  The Ruskies didn't get him.  Oh, my God.  I love how he...  This comes right on the heels of his 141 IQ.  Yeah, what's your official answer?  My official?  Yeah.  Can I give you a hundred people?  Your final answer.  Your final answer.  Let's go.  My final...  In 62.  What happened in 62?  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  The Six-Day War.  No, that was in...  Oh, my God.  What was the Six-Day War?  We're talking about the brink of World War III. 
[02:07:30]  Complete annihilation of the globe.  And you're naming all these innocuous things.  Yeah.  That cab driver got robbed in Tel Aviv?  No, Rich.  What is it?  Can we come back to any of these?  No.  What is it?  It's to revisit them.  What is it?  Come on, Rich.  Yeah.  I...  It wasn't...  It's something to do with Kennedy.  Kennedy.  Uh...  No.  Uh...  I don't want to... 
[02:08:00]  I don't want...  Uh...  Come on.  I'm armed with the King Jr.  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep 
[02:08:30]  That was the first thing you said was Bay of Pigs.  You said Bay of Pigs.  Then you said the Russian.  No, I said you go play the tape.  Bay of Pigs was not the Cuban Missile Crisis.  Different things, Rich.  Bay of Pigs was going to invade to get Castro out.  Yeah.  Well, I said the Cuban Missile Crisis.  Play the tape back.  You said the Russian Missile Crisis.  No, I said I will bet $200.  You said the Russian Missile Crisis. 
[02:09:00]  $200.  I'll bet more than that because I know I heard it.  I'm just being nuts.  Russian Missile Crisis.  You got singles in there.  Why are you looking for your money?  He said it wrong because he's an adult.  But I think I have to give that one to Voss.  He knew what it was.  He's just not an articulate man.  We're playing by the rules of Wheel of Fortune.  I'm not betting.  I got $100, right?  Oh, yeah, you can't gamble.  It's not gambling.  How about it's a bet?  How about if I'm right, I get to punch you? 
[02:09:30]  No, that's gambling.  If you're wrong, I get to.  Do we give it to him?  I guess we have to.  He just said it wrong.  He's not an articulate man.  All right, we'll give it to you.  But your first answer was Bay of Pigs.  Your second answer was Russian Missile Crisis.  It is the Cuban Missile Crisis.  I have a non-vote in this.  Well, here's what I say.  Forget that question.  Find another question.  All right, here.  We only got three questions left.  Let's see if you can pass a fifth grade test.  What is the verb of the following sentence? 
[02:10:00]  The goat ran into the barn.  Boom.  The beyond.  The goat ran.  Ran.  Is that your final answer?  Yeah, ran.  All right, very good.  Spell the opposite of vertical.  Horizontal.  Perfect.  I got to spell it?  Yes, you got to spell it.  Oh, where are these questions?  Yeah, I don't know where these questions are.  I only have ten.  I only have ten.  We jazzed it up because some of those questions were kind of loud.  Yeah, they were lame. 
[02:10:30]  I'm sorry, we had a revised quiz.  Wait, hold on.  Horizontal.  Okay.  Horizontal.  H-O-R-I-Z-O-N-T-A-L.  Nope.  B.  I can't believe you fell.  I gave him the hand, like, you know, come on, you're almost there.  One more letter.  He goes, ee. 
[02:11:00]  E.  Tell me, ee, I love you.  I really do.  Bonnie's a lucky woman.  I was right, though.  Yeah, we'll give that one to you.  I have to, yeah.  Bye, go on.  Yeah, yeah, come on.  And finally, who was the U.S. president when World War II ended?  Get this right, you'll get a 70 on the test.  It's either Roosevelt or Eisenhower.  Okay.  I would have to say.  You almost said Eisenheimer, like Weisenheimer.  You're such an old man.  No, I didn't. 
[02:11:30]  It was Roosevelt.  All right, very good.  That's wrong.  By the way, not only is it wrong, he was dead.  Who?  Roosevelt was dead at the end of the war.  Of World War II?  It was Taft, Rich.  So if it wasn't Roosevelt, who was it?  Well, the end of World War II was in Eisenhower.  Was in what?  In the 50s.  The end of World War II was in the 50s.  And if it wasn't, so you're now saying Eisenhower, right? 
[02:12:00]  I said Roosevelt.  All right, he was wrong, so you're now saying Eisenhower.  Well, why would you give me a second chance?  I'm just asking.  Yeah, it was Roosevelt or Eisenhower.  Wrong again.  Now, who?  I can't be wrong twice.  Yeah, because your choices were both wrong.  The war ended with the dropping of the atomic bombs.  Yeah.  Who dropped the bombs?  Who was the president that was in office when the bombs dropped on Japan?  Hiroshima Nagasaki. 
[02:12:30]  No, he wasn't the president.  Hiroshima Nagasaki was not our president.  No, he's the commissioner of Japanese baseball.  It was the president during...  Ouch.  Yeah.  Why?  I didn't hear it.  He was Roosevelt's vice president.  Oh, it was...  What do you call it?  Good.  It was...  141.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  What do you call it?  Go ahead.  What do you call it?  Roosevelt's vice president.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Come on.  I know you got this one.  It wasn't Spirol.  More brains after the suicide. 
[02:13:00]  What's that?  Nothing.  Go ahead.  Roosevelt's vice president.  Obama.  Give us the answer, Rich.  Well...  Inside of your head is a Florida swamp.  Go ahead.  As you think about it, Steve from Syracuse has something.  Steve, what's up, buddy?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Well, I got to tell you, I was looking in the shower and answering the questions,  and I think Voss originally was, you know, he should be, you know, are you smarter than 
[02:13:30]  a preschooler?  And I think that if Harry Truman was alive right now, you'd be kicking Voss' ass.  It was Truman.  It was Truman.  I knew that.  He just gave you the answer.  He was talking about a guy he went to school with, Harry Truman.  Yeah.  Harry Truman.  Was it Truman?  Truman.  It's too late.  It was Truman.  Was it Truman?  Nobody's really big on president's tribute.  By the way, Steve, he's probably one of the more memorable people.  The more memorable ones, being the one that, you know, dropped the atomic bombs. 
[02:14:00]  By the way, Truman.  That didn't actually end World War II.  Oh, it didn't?  Boy, and quickly.  It didn't.  I mean, what was the World War where Germany was going and taking, you know, just out of  control?  That was World War II.  And the Korean War, Rich.  That was World War II.  Yeah.  And World War I.  And then what was the war where the Japanese were involved and we dropped two atomic bombs?  That was World War II where they got, they hooked up with Germany.  Very good.  Okay.  But.  But. 
[02:14:30]  Germany.  Oh, no.  Here comes the but.  Maybe.  Like, I'm not really on top of this.  Right?  Really?  Yeah.  By this, you mean everything.  I think.  Here's what happened.  Yeah.  What happened?  Germany was still, after we dropped a bomb, Germany didn't just say, hey, we're done.  We still had to go in.  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus on a cross.  Oh, my dear, sweet Lord.  Whatever happened.  So, you have no idea that Germany had already surrendered and the war in Europe was over by 
[02:15:00]  the time we really concentrated our forces over there in Japan and stuff.  See, we beat the Germans first.  Then we beat the Japanese.  I gotta, you know, I gotta read a little more.  Yeah, you gotta brush up a little.  Ask me about us.  Do you think the Germans had just laid down their weapons after we bombed Hiroshima?  Steve from.  Yes, they did.  I want to get rid of Steve from Syracuse listening on 95X.  Steve, you had a great line there.  You want to use it or what? 
[02:15:30]  I'd say yeah, man.  Go ahead.  Voss, you need to go on.  You need to go on.  Are you smarter than a preschooler?  Or maybe even are you smarter than a fetus?  That's what I think.  All right, sir.  Oh, boy.  Well, I mean.  And as a Jew, you should know these things.  Well, ask me about the six-day war.  Never forget.  With you, it's never, ever new.  Ask me how long the six-day war lasted.  All right.  Six days.  Let's say hi to Mike in Jersey.  Mike.  It's actually a myth. 
[02:16:00]  Mike.  It didn't last for six days.  Right.  That's good.  Two months.  You need to have Voss on every week to do this because this is friggin' hilarious.  And he's being serious, by the way.  Yes, he's not.  You got a 60 on a fifth grade test today.  That's not bad.  It's a passing grade.  He's not being ironic.  Well, here's the deal.  Here's the deal.  All right.  Let's go to Matt in Pennsylvania.  Matt.  Hey, Voss, could you spell IQ?  E-Y-E.  What does IQ stand for? 
[02:16:30]  Intellectual quotations.  Holy Jesus.  Oh, my God.  We've been searching for a long time.  And we found the new spaz.  Intellectual quotations.  We got the new spaz in studio.  Quotations.  Intellectual, uh, whatever.  The Q, I don't know.  Intellectual quiz.  I just say I'm queer.  Oh, God. 
[02:17:00]  Intellectual quiz.  Wow.  What is it, really?  I don't know that one.  Your IQ, which you are saying, is 141.  141.  Yet you have no idea what IQ stands for.  I know how to get to it on the internet.  IQ test.  IQ.  Intellectual quiz.  What do you think it stands for?  Quotient.  Intelligence quotient.  That's that same thing.  Intellectual quiz.  Intellectual, um, quotation.  Oh, my God.  Let's go to Dan and Philly.  I love Rich Voss.  Oh.  Dan, go ahead. 
[02:17:30]  You guys got to chain him to a chair and never let him leave.  Yeah.  Hey, Voss, you should get a nameplate for your death that says the schmuck stops here.  And let's go to Lori in Jersey.  Lori.  Hi, how are you?  Hey, good.  Um, the thing is that, to be fair, uh, history classes, he might not be, just, he just might  not have the history, uh, so, and he probably failed it when he was in school.  What?  But, he might have failed history while he was in school. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, right, yes.  Uh, but, to be fair, um.  Fair?  He is Jewish.  I mean, you learn World War II history in Hebrew school.  Did you go to Hebrew school?  Did you go to Hebrew school?  I didn't pay attention.  I couldn't understand English.  How am I going to understand Hebrew school?  What's wrong with you?  Basically, you're saying Voss is Jewish and doesn't know about World War II.  I know, I know a lot about it.  What do you know about it?  Thank you, Lori.  What's that?  You didn't know who surrendered.  I, I know, I know Roosevelt didn't bomb the train.  Was it Roosevelt or, uh, who was the other one you were talking about? 
[02:18:30]  Truman?  You're naming people who didn't bomb the Japanese.  No, not to, uh, who didn't bomb what?  I just want to know where you were going with that one.  I love this World War II stuff.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I love your World War II material.  You're, you just go into your basement and live it every day.  Ken Burns has competition.  I can't wait for your documentary there, Rich.  I'll tell you, listen, I'm serious.  I'll take an IQ test here.  All right, well.  Are they doing it or not today?  No.  Because, no, we got something.  Oh, well, we can do that. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, we should definitely.  We got Max in Dallas.  Max, go ahead.  Hey, ONA.  What's up, Dukas?  Uh, I've got the perfect idea for you.  A dumb-off between Boston and Francine.  Let's do it.  Next week.  A dumb-off.  Can you come in next week?  Yes.  We're working Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday next week?  Killer, though, yeah.  I'll go with Bobby Kelly.  That's who he thinks he's smarter than me.  Bobby should be involved.  Bob is as stupid as they come.  Bobby, and he's always saying how dumb I am. 
[02:19:30]  I'm smarter than Bobby.  Okay, I'll take Bobby on.  That's not saying a lot.  All right, we're going to get Bobby, we're going to get you, and we're going to get Francine.  Hopefully next week.  Can you guys try to make that happen immediately?  Yeah.  And we'll have a fifth-grade exam.  No, we can have a real one.  I'm talking about...  This is a real one, obviously.  You've got a 60.  You know, I'm talking about some serious questions that, you know...  Oh, yeah, screw questions about World War II and the Cuban Missile Crisis.  Yeah, trivial events.  Yeah, those are just...  Those are just dumb.  You're right.  I bet you can't explain the whole Bay of Pigs. 
[02:20:00]  What was it about?  What...  I know...  Can you?  All right, go ahead.  Yeah, what is it?  What happened to the Bay of Pigs?  What was the Bay of Pigs about?  What happened was...  Teach us.  Okay, we were over there.  This is why Kennedy was assassinated, because we were over there.  We had a lot of money invested in casinos and over there, and Castro was taken over,  pushing out a dictatorship, and we were going to lose all our money there, so the mob...  Pushing out a dictatorship.  No, he was pushing out the regime to take over as a dictator in the country, okay? 
[02:20:30]  So the rebels wanted to overthrow Castro, as this was happening, and was seeking the help  of America.  And, you know, it's all history from there.  I love just watching you unravel.  I actually saw beads of sweat forming on your forehead in the middle of that.  I'm just trying to remember the godfather.  The godfather! 
[02:21:00]  Basically...  Well, I don't think it had much to do with casinos at that point.  I think it had to do with a communist country being 90 miles off of Florida.  Yeah, but the rebels didn't want to deal with Castro.  He was just out of control.  Well, we kind of didn't want to deal with Castro.  Yeah, but if you know...  And there was a rebellion against Castro, but it wasn't very strong.  So we said, look, we're going to give you guys a hand.  We'll back you up if you take on Castro.  We'll train you. 
[02:21:30]  We'll give you support.  We can't be directly involved.  So it was a CIA kind of, you know, covert thing.  I feel like I'm in school.  I'm looking at the teacher right now.  And when it finally happened, we kind of hung them out to dry and didn't give them the support  that we promised them, and they wound up getting their asses handed to them, and it failed.  Didn't people think that that was a secret deal cut to kind of make the Cuban Missile Crisis  go away, I think?  To make the Cuban Missile Crisis go away. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, because during the Cuban Missile Crisis, they were pointed at us.  Yeah, there is speculation that all that's tied together.  They were pointed at us.  They were pointed at us.  What?  The missiles.  All right, let's go to Tim in Pennsylvania.  Tim, what's up?  I just love history.  You should have CokeLogic doing animation with Rich Voss with a World War II map behind  and trying to explain all the areas.  Oh, that'd be great.  CokeLogic will come up with some.  Mark in New York, what's up?  That's the best bit. 
[02:22:30]  Bravo, fellas.  That's the best bit I've heard in weeks and weeks and weeks.  We're not even trying.  It's just the basic crap.  Fred in New York, what's up?  Yes, he's more smarter than a crack baby.  Let's go to Tom in Jersey.  You got the phones lit there, Rich.  You're doing something right.  Tom, what's up?  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  Rich is teaching special ed today, huh?  Well, so much for the phone.  Joe, save us.  Hey, boys. 
[02:23:00]  Hey.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  I've got a question for you, Richard.  Who was the president when Kennedy was shot?  That's a good question.  He was the president when Kennedy was shot.  Of course, he was the president.  What kind of question is that?  I got that one.  He was trying to trick you.  I know.  Yeah, it was a trick question.  And he almost had you.  No.  Hey, you know what?  There's a little paranoid in your life.  Listen, let me explain something about me.  Okay.  I quit school. 
[02:23:30]  Okay.  But.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  I have 141 IQ.  I know.  I never believe that.  I will never believe that.  I used to run a business.  You know what?  Let me explain something.  Dealing drugs is not a business.  I used to have.  Can we take an IQ test after the break?  How long does it take?  I say.  How long does it take?  It does take a while.  And he'd have to be sequestered somewhere.  Can we put him in the glass booth?  I'll do that.  Next week we'll do the.  Dude, I will put.  I know you're not a gambler. 
[02:24:00]  But I will just leave $1,000 like sitting over here.  If you score more than a three.  And if you score.  Three.  And if you get within 10 points of 141, you could just steal my money.  It's not gambling.  I'll just leave it here.  It's just laying around.  I understand you're in recovery, so it's not a bet.  But I will just leave $1,000 out.  And I'll just leave it.  I'll leave and go, oh, man, I forgot my money.  No.  First of all, here's how you do it.  Leave GH's money alone. 
[02:24:30]  I don't want your money.  What I want is you just to say.  Vindication is what you want.  Because when I was 21 years old, before I went to the mental institution, when I was 20, around that area.  Yeah.  I had seven guys working for me.  Like, there's certain things I'm smart at.  You know what I mean?  Like, I used to run a business.  I had seven employees when I was 20 years old.  Back then, paying them like $8.  Now, I used to.  I had contracts all over town, painting houses and remodeling them and stuff. 
[02:25:00]  Okay?  And whenever I filled out a contract or picked up the money, no one ever asked me, okay, so you're going to paint the peaks.  You're going to put shingles on and never throw in a World War II question.  You're street smart.  You're street smart.  I get it.  Not street smart business.  I know.  You know how to get more drugs from a drug dealer by dressing sexy.  I get it.  You're street smart.  Okay.  Lingy, lingy.  All right.  We got to take a break.  Brokerage this weekend.  Yes.  Friday and Saturday, Rich will be at the Brokerage Comedy Club in Belmore, New York.  I'll be at the Providence Comedy Connection this Friday, Saturday in Rhode Island. 
[02:25:30]  Okay.  So if you're in Providence, come on down.  Have some laughs.  Let's speak of comedians.  We got Jim Jefferies in the green room.  I saw him at the Dennis Leary and Friends thing last week as part of the New York Comedy Festival.  Man, the first time I saw him live, the guy's hilarious.  Did he get punched?  Well, ask him.  I don't know.  We'll ask him.  Is he the guy that got punched?  I don't know.  I worked with him in England a couple weeks ago.  He is really, really funny.  He was the one comic that sat with me when I was in England taping a TV show a couple weeks ago.  He was so nice. 
[02:26:00]  Speaking of World War II, who would think that an enemy from World War II,  and you would be able to go there and play in England now, and there wouldn't be a problem?  What am I supposed to say?  What am I supposed to say?  By the way, Tony and Reno are saying that Voss' IQ is leaking out of his ear there.  You know what you are?  You're a rock with teeth.  Hey, hey, hey.  Now enjoy.

[02:30:30]  That's W-I-X.com.  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  Larry Hagman.  He was doing Dallas, I guess, huh?  They brought that back.  They showed interviews of him from June.  He looked healthy.  For an 81-year-old guy, he looked pretty damn healthy.  Yeah.  And with it, yeah.  What did he die of?  Did they even say?  I don't know.  He had the cancer, the cancer.  Did he?  I think so.  I was reading something about the magnitude of Dallas, 
[02:31:00]  and it was, they said 300 million people worldwide saw that, the J.R. shooting episode.  I used to love this because they had a flyover of Texas Stadium.  Yes.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  It's so, yeah, yeah, Dallas.  A great theme song.  Yeah.  They have that disco little part in there. 
[02:31:30]  This show is before my time.  And Ken Kerchival.  Huh?  Yeah, this show is before my time.  I saw it in reruns a couple times, but...  J.R. Ewing.  Larry Hagman.  300 million people saw that, and it was a story that he was meeting the Queen of England.  Yeah.  And she asked him, who shot J.R., and he said, not even for you, ma'am.  He wouldn't tell her.  Wow.  What an asshole.  Wouldn't tell the Queen.  I don't even know if he knew.  Good for him.  Fuck that bitch. 
[02:32:00]  Biggest cliffhanger ever in TV.  Who wound up shooting J.R.?  Kristen.  It was Kristen?  Yeah.  Friday night, I think it was on, right?  That was all before Falcon Crest.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, no!  What's happening?  There's some duplicitous behavior on Falcon Crest.  Did you watch Falcon Crest?  No.  Wasn't that Morgan Fairchild?  Yeah.  Another show before my time.  Dynasty?  I didn't watch any of them but Dallas.  Falcon Crest. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, no!  I don't remember who was on that one.  I think Morgan Fairchild.  Seems to me there's been some real comeuppance on Falcon Crest.  Falcon Crest.  Oh, there was always just some rich people shows.  Yeah.  When did you get your picture with Larry Hagman?  I just saw that pop up on the screen there.  I went with Kenny and his poor son, Doug, was so bored because we went to this signing  at, like, Comic-Con and I wanted to meet all the Dallas people.  And Doug's a young guy. 
[02:33:00]  He wanted nothing to do with...  You don't give a fuck about Dallas?  No, because it's the guys from Dallas and fucking, like, other...  I don't know if there was anybody there from Falcon Crest!  But I didn't know it.  Why do we not know who was on Falcon Crest still?  But I met Larry Hagman.  You see, there's a picture on my Twitter of Larry Hagman and some fat fuck.  Jesus Christ.  How many years ago was that?  A year ago?  Maybe Kenny will know.  Dynasty was the other one, too.  Oh, yeah, Dynasty, sure. 
[02:33:30]  Dynasty, oh.  Another show before my time.  So the reruns.  Regal-sounding white people music.  These are terrible songs, though.  Dallas had a...  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Continue.  But then you hop over to Falcon Crest.  And Dynasty.  This stinks.  Yes.  No blacks.  Exactly.  Yes.  Here in Dynasty. 
[02:34:00]  What years did they all run those shows?  Dallas was 78 to something?  70 to...  Into the 80s.  Way before my fucking time.  They were very 80s shows.  No, that was into the 90s, Dallas.  I mean, but like...  Their pinnacle was in the 80s, really.  Yeah.  Although, the late 70s, Dallas, yeah, was huge.  Can we look at them up, Sam?  What years they ran from...  And when was...  78 to 91 was there.  And how about Dynasty?  Dynasty.  Falcon Crest was 81 to 90.  Wow. 
[02:34:30]  Nine years that ran...  That's a good run, huh?  Okay, yeah.  I didn't realize it.  Falcon Crest!  Fred is so long.  Where do you live?  I reside in Falcon Crest, my good man.  People say, don't forget Knott's Landing.  Knott's Landing.  Do you remember Knott's Landing?  What is the theme to Knott's Landing?  I knew it was in Knott's Landing.  Oh.  Dynasty ran 81 to 89. 
[02:35:00]  Okay, so that had an eight-year run.  Oh, with John Derrick's wife there.  Bo Derrick?  No, the other one before the Bo Derrick.  Oh, I don't know.  Bo Deedle?  Ah, what the fuck was her name?  Bo Swenson?  She was a buxom blonde.  Not...  You know who it is.  It wasn't Morgan Fairchild, though.  She was on Falcon Crest.  Knott's Landing was 79 to 93.  And who was on Knott's Landing? 
[02:35:30]  Oh, Michelle Lee, yeah.  This Knott's Landing?  Yeah, man.  Oh, wow.  It was about the Challenger.  It's Knott's Landing.  Don and the Berry Farm guy in a plane.  Don.  Oh, William Devane was on this.  I didn't remember that.  Hi, I'm Bill Devane.  I'm flying a plane.  I'm riding horses, and I got gold.  That guy's so annoying now.  I know.  He was great in the marathon, man. 
[02:36:00]  Keep your head down!  And he drives him right back.  Yeah, drives him back.  What a scumbag.  Oh, he was a prick.  I liked him in the Bad News Bears, too.  Yes, as a coach.  This is how we're going to get the young demos there, Sam Roberts.  That's right.  Now, get back to the cast of Dynasty.  I know you're still learning there, sir.  I've never heard of the show Knott's Landing before.  That was a big show.  Linda Evans.  Linda Evans.  Wow.  Thank you, Dan Mooney in New York City.  Linda Evans.  Go to, uh...  Used to be married to John Derrick. 
[02:36:30]  Oy, Bo Derrick Leiden.  Go to Dynasty.  What about Twin Peaks?  That wasn't...  Who was on Dynasty?  Oh, John Forsythe.  Linda Evans.  Okay.  Joan Collins.  Linda Evans was a looker for a while there.  What does Joan Collins look like these days?  Joan Collins.  Ooh, she was the ritzy-titsy bitch from Dynasty, as Pryor said.  What does she look like?  She don't look like... 
[02:37:00]  Whoa.  That's not bad.  That's probably even old now.  That's now.  That's not bad if that's how she looks now.  Nah, she was an actress way back when.  She was in Tales from the Crypt, I think.  What was Dynasty about?  She started to look like Liza Minnelli.  Oh, boy.  Oh, God.  Dallas was about an oil family.  They lived on a South Fork ranch.  South Fork.  And Jock was the father.  Jimmy knows these dumb shows.  Yeah, he does.  And there was, of course, there was Charlene Tilton before she became a piggy. 
[02:37:30]  She was on the brink constantly of getting fat.  Yes.  And then there was Bobby and J.R., of course.  Yes.  And she had her helpings of mash.  Yeah, I think a lot of mash.  And who was the wife, Pam, was the wife who was very pretty.  And then Linda Gray.  Linda Gray.  Was fucking J.R.'s wife.  I remember Linda Gray.  Susan, I think.  And then Ken Kirchival.  I don't remember who he played.  I know this shit. 
[02:38:00]  I don't know why.  I just remember.  Sometimes I wake up for no reason at all, three in the morning, and I go, Ken Kirchival.  And then I go back to sleep.  And then there was Jock.  I remember one awful line where the mother was eulogizing Jock after he died, because he  died while they were shooting, I guess.  Oh.  And she said, and you were my man.  And I remember my mother hated that line.  She said, that was terrible.  And it just stuck with me how awful that was.  But it was about oil people.  Yes.  They were a very rich oil family. 
[02:38:30]  Oil parents.  With a lot of diabolical schemes going on.  And what was this about, Dynasty, Sam?  Another oil family.  Oh.  Enough with the oil families.  I know.  In Denver?  Denver.  Colorado.  Were they all loopy with the altitude?  Oh, good God.  Why is it there's one good show, and then they all have to jump on it?  I know.  Enough with the oil families.  So what were they doing?  Looking for oil in Denver?  Were they broke?  I don't remember.  I don't know. 
[02:39:00]  Went off the air in 1989.  What was Knott's Landing about?  How old were you when the show went off the air, Sam Roberts?  Six.  Six.  Probably five.  Yeah, I was about 12, 13, I think.  13, yeah.  No, you were probably about...  30?  No.  Almost.  No.  Approaching 30.  No.  Whoa.  No asshole.  Jesus.  Go to Knott's Landing, you clit.  Oh, of course.  What about Santa Barbara?  Where are we at with Santa Barbara?  I don't remember that one.  I've never heard of any of these shows.  I know Dynasty.  That's where you're going to be a failure in radio. 
[02:39:30]  No, it's not.  How do you not know this stuff?  You know why?  There's going to be a failure.  Because people have moved on.  No, they haven't.  Yeah, they have.  The phones are lit.  The instant feedback's lit.  That's all they want to talk about.  All they want to talk about is Linda Gray.  We have different...  And the Colby's.  Linda Gray!  We have different Target demos.  What are you talking about?  They even used the last name Ewing?  Yeah.  Yeah, because it was a spinoff.  Oh, it was a spinoff.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, of Dallas.  Yes.  Not Slanding.  Yes.  But this was way before fucking VCRs were at homes. 
[02:40:00]  I mean, you missed it.  You missed it.  Yeah.  That was it.  You had to wait for the reruns.  Oh.  Was that a show, too?  You missed it.  You missed it.  You missed it.  You missed it.  You missed it.  Yes, but I never knew if I should put a comma, a dash, or a semicolon in between the  two.  You missed it.  Well, thank God.  Now you can get Not Slanding on DVD.  Well, thank God is right, man.  You never have to miss it.  Let's start playing fucking clips from that show on a daily basis.  Not Slanding.  Eight minute clips.  Yeah.  Out of context.  Not Slanding moment.  Yes. 
[02:40:30]  And you have to be eight minutes every time.  Eight minutes of Not Slanding.  I totally got a sequence.  I love a Not Slanding moment.  That's a great idea.  Oh, yes.  Every day, a Not Slanding moment.  Oh, yeah.  Sorry.  Rollington texted me.  Rollington.  Remington Steel.  Oh, so I put them together and made Rollington.  Rollington Steel.  Nice.  It's the adventures of a man with a food addiction and some self-hatred who's shy, and  yet he's not.  Yet he's not shy at all.  Remington Steel.  Remington Steel. 
[02:41:00]  Rollington.  What about Hardcastle and McCormick?  Oh, that's right.  I hated that show.  Now we're going a little too deep.  No, that was a big one.  Hardcastle and McCormick?  Tell me what the show was about.  I think there were cops.  God, how do you know this?  Were they cops or no?  That was a big show.  I think they were private dicks.  It ran for three years.  I've never even heard of it.  I mean, people knew it.  A retired judge and his last defendant follow up on cases that were dismissed due to technicalities.  Oh, yeah.  This is the Hardcastle and McCormick theme?  This is not a big show.  All right.  How about, what's the one that's on Rizzoli and Isles right now? 
[02:41:30]  That name makes me so crazy.  I see that big poster for it every day.  No, no, not.  It's something in Isles.  Yeah, Rizzoli and Isles.  Oh, terrible.  You never call women by their last name.  No one does.  It's too tough as nail.  What's it about?  Oh, this looks horrendous.  Two different jobs.  One killer team.  Nice.  What are they?  They're probably like...  Are they killers? 
[02:42:00]  Sam, how about a synopsis?  All the synopsis is series based on some novels featuring Jane Rizzoli.  All right.  All right.  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Sirius XM.

Why did they call that the hair club for men?  Every one of those fuckers is bald.  No clue whatsoever.  Mind if I talk about sex for a minute? 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  You mind?  You lying sex and shit, you won't want to hear about it.  The thing.  Let's just keep the thing over here for a little longer.  No, no, no, no, no.  A little longer.  I want to hear more.  A little longer.  I got to hear more.  Of course you want to hear more.  That's why.  Oh, my God.  I keep the thing over here.  I feel so, like.  You uncomfortable?  I'm a little uncomfortable, Jimmy.  You should see it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Can you bring it up?  What's with the accent?  I know.  Let's just keep the thing over there for a little while. 
[02:47:30]  I got to hear it.  I really want to keep people in their cars and trucks today.  They don't care.  They'll get right out and listen to it later.  No, they won't.  Oh, I.  Oh.  They won't.  Oh.  No, they care.  What the heck?  Club for men.  That's an Otto and George joke stolen.  Rocketing Yoo-Hoo.  That was.  Oh, no.  No way.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy.  Is this the.  That's it.  Is this what I got?  It's the same thing?  Jimmy is wearing MC Hammer pants. 
[02:48:00]  That's.  I'll tell you what that is.  It's 1990.  There was a comedy.  A contest for Bud Light.  And I think I was too.  They only taped me for like.  How long is it taped?  Two minutes?  Two minutes.  They taped me for two and a half minutes and then just turned off the recorder.  Because I was too dirty.  It was.  Ugh.  What is with the pants?  I always wore those.  MC Hammer pants?  I thought they were cool.  The big fucking puppy pants.  And then you got a little Bud Light t-shirt on.  Look at what a skinny little gent you were.  Very depressing.  Big head of hair. 
[02:48:30]  I can't get the audio up.  Oh.  Really?  Is it you or me?  And if it's me, fucking Mars is going to get a beating.  That?  I think it's only one channel.  I have no channels.  You look hysterical.  It doesn't look like you.  No.  It looks like somebody who could be like, wow, that looks like a young Guido Jimmy.  I know.  A little Jersey idiot.  You are a Jersey idiot.  You're going to put this online.  I'm going to.  I'm having it done.  I haven't found a bunch of old shit. 
[02:49:00]  I'm going to show a progression of how awful I got.  This?  You want to sync it up?  Oh, it's terrible.  I can't hear it over here.  I can't hear it either.  It's in one channel because it's.  What happened?  I would hold the.  I would never take the mic out of the stand.  But the Jersey accent is really embarrassing.  You want to play this now?  You might as well.  I mean.  I don't think anybody will wait for it.  Nobody cares.  With the pants.  No, they'll wait for it.  You think?  Yes.  I want to hear it.  This is the type of stuff you hold back.  You could play it now and play it again. 
[02:49:30]  You want to sync it up, Danny?  I can't.  Does that start when this starts?  I don't know.  I can't hear it.  I'm in the same boat as you.  I can't hear it.  No, I know.  Just start yours at the same time.  I think it's the full clip, though.  It'll be close enough.  It'll be close.  Just so we have a visual.  For us.  Not anybody else.  As I prowl the stage.  I just don't know if you have the full clip.  That's all.  Well, that's why I asked Jimmy.  Is that the same clip?  Yeah.  It is?  It is.  All right.  So just start at the same time.  It'll be close enough. 
[02:50:00]  Here's Jimmy from how long ago?  This was...  I was doing comedy six months, and I had won one leg of a competition in New Jersey, in  Rascal South, and this was the Bud Light Comedy Competition in Rascal's West Orange.  So you just started your comedy career, but what year?  1990.  This was...  So this is 20 years ago?  Dude, this is fucking...  I want to say October of 1990.  My first time on stage was April 1st, and I was six months in to comedy.  I remember when I was doing it.  No kidding.  Holy shit.  I was doing Spuds Buckley when you were doing this. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  It's a bad...  But I wish I had continued in this vein, because I...  You look like Spuds Buckley.  I went into my high energy thing after this.  Like, I tried to be likable.  Like, this wasn't really...  This was more aggressive.  Yeah.  But then people were like, you gotta be likable.  And that's when I went on to that high energy thing, which is...  With the wacky voice?  Much more humiliating than this.  And you're putting on some type of...  Heavier accents.  Very heavy New York-ish Jersey accent.  It was just a performing thing.  I don't know why I did that.  I was trying to find myself.  All right, here we go.  Should have looked in the douchebag emporium. 
[02:51:00]  That's where I would have been.  Jim Norton from 20 years ago.  Oh, dear.  A little taste.  Why did they call that the hair club for men?  Every one of those fuckers is bald.  No clue whatsoever.  Mind if I talk about sex for a minute?  Yeah.  You mind?  You lying sex and shit, you won't want to hear about it.  But I'd like to talk...  For one thing, Bud Light is sponsoring this thing, as we all know.  They make you wear this shirt.  And I don't even drink.  Men in the audience, any men in this audience ever try to have sex when we're drunk? 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like trying to stuff a marshmallow into a coin slot.  So fucking, you son of a bitch.  And as soon as you leave, forget it.  Hard enough to cut glass.  You cannot fucking win.  And this microphone is full.  There we go.  We got it.  Men in the audience, let's see how honest we are tonight.  That's the line I hate.  He's getting laughs, though.  I was.  Six months into...  He's getting laughs.  With Otto's line.  They're laughing at him. 
[02:52:00]  Hair club for men was Otto's.  I have to keep saying that.  I'm sorry, Otto.  Oh.  It's just weird.  Hair club for men.  Sounds like a completely different person, obviously.  Yeah.  It really does.  Like more of an ass.  That accent is the fucking worst.  Pat from Monaco is calling you Jimmy DiPaolo.  I didn't know who Nick DiPaolo was at that point.  Or did I?  No.  He was...  Nick's a Boston guy.  Jimmy's rocketing dignity.  What are you talking about?  Yeah, we got it. 
[02:52:30]  There we go.  Oh, this mic is...  There we are.  Phone is phone.  There we go.  We got it.  Men in the...  Let's see how honest we are tonight.  How many men in this audience masturbate?  I love an honest group.  Come on, man.  You're going to tell me with a face like that you don't masturbate, sir?  There you go.  You got hands like the fucking werewolf.  I know you masturbate.  It's like you got Willie Nelson in a chokehold.  I masturbated a lot growing up as a kid, man. 
[02:53:00]  I got no shame in it.  Growing up, my sheets look like cornflakes.  I'm serious, man.  My parents used to bend up my sheets at the end of the week and sell them as wicker furniture.  Can I pause that?  That's still two of the best lines I've ever written.  Yeah.  My sheets look like cornflakes and wicker furniture.  Yes.  I will take those to the grave.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a good line.  It certainly was.  And I'll tell you where that came from.  I used to jerk off and I would wipe my own cum off with my sheet, move it over a little 
[02:53:30]  and fall asleep.  I would wipe cum off on the sheets.  I slept it.  Yeah.  Do you think mom knew?  Grandmama and I were changing the sheets one time.  She was helping me.  And literally, there was a giant stiff patch and my grandmother said to me, what happened  here?  And I was like, I spilled Pepsi.  Pepsi.  Is that what you call it?  Yes.  Because it tastes like cum.  Yeah.  Wow.  Well, the line is good, but it's delivered like Ralph Macchio. 
[02:54:00]  There you go.  Hey.  Sounds like we're listening to a young comedian out there.  You know, it's hard.  Without the comedian part, a young horse's ass.  It's hard to, it's hard to connect this to you.  I know.  It doesn't sound like you.  Your voice is completely different.  I don't know when I blew it.  I have tape from, uh, 95.  I went through this really weird time where in 93, I was like that high energy, like,  where I should have been, had my throat cut.  But then I started coming to New York and in 95, I just found a set where fucking Eddie 
[02:54:30]  Brill brings me on a carillon.  He didn't know my name.  He's like, um, when I was on my way to, to, to ask, to Vail to do a comedy contest out  there and I'm like, I still have a little bit of the high energy voice, but I'm starting  to mellow.  It's like, you can see it's a huge difference from 93.  Yeah.  It's kind of cool to see.  Like I wasn't as big a douchebag.  Thank God for stage time.  This is, this is just very interesting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's, it's, there's a confidence in you six months in.  It was just pretend.  It really, you're out of your hands.  I was terrified. 
[02:55:00]  Really?  I used to pray for gigs to get canceled.  Really?  Oh God.  Your body language is funny.  Your body language is definitely showing confidence.  Dude, I, I, I like myself more here than I did when I was doing the, how we doing?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In my head.  That's why I thought this would be really bad.  I like that.  Because we've heard the high energy stuff that's really uncomfortable to listen to.  I just like the voice.  This isn't as uncomfortable.  No, it's not.  The voice is very strange.  This is really odd.  But this is just a guy six months in.  In MC Hammer pants.  Oh, they're terrible.  Here we go.  Let's play more.  My parents used to bend up my sheets at the end of the week and sell them as wicker furniture. 
[02:55:30]  But I got no shame.  Anybody, uh, men remember the first time they masturbated?  Not yet.  Come on, sir.  Do you remember the first time you masturbated?  Sure, he's doing it right now.  I remember the first time I masturbated.  I didn't know how to do it.  I was a dumb kid growing up.  So I asked somebody.  I had no pride.  I said, how do you masturbate?  He says, dummy. 
[02:56:00]  It's like shaking a ketchup bottle.  I said, okay, I think I could do that.  So that night I was trying it.  I was having a great time.  And my mother had to ruin it for me.  She screamed at me.  She said, what the hell are you doing to those French fries?  They kicked us out of the restaurant.  I mean, it was bad news, man.  Phone sex is a new thing.  I tried phone sex.  I didn't like that.  I almost got electrocuted.  Bad experience, man.  It fell apart a little bit. 
[02:56:30]  And you see my hands over my face?  That's how the, uh, hold on.  Yeah.  Just keep it right there.  Yeah.  That's how the tape ends.  Sam cut it just to be, you know, radio conscientious.  But it quit because the next one was, I remember I masturbated and it was, I used to do a joke  about jerking off in church and whoever was taping it just had enough.  Hey, we needed that.  No, no.  That was, you can't hear it.  No, I know, but that would be hilarious to just hear the tape end in the middle of your set.  Wow, they just, like, they just, like, cut you off? 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, I mean, I, I...  Well, because they knew they weren't using it because it was too dirty.  So dirty.  Bud Light can't have fucking masturbation jokes.  Yeah, why not?  Come on.  Bud Light?  Maybe Bud Light.  Yeah, well.  Maybe for Bud Light, but not for Budweiser.  It was for Fox, I think, or something.  I would love to get the whole tape, but I think that that literally is all that exists.  Wow.  Yes.  The voice is beyond recognition.  It's, it's not you.  I don't know when my voice changed. 
[02:57:30]  It changed at one point.  It might have been when I was doing 1999 when me and Louis Black did that fucking short film  together where I screamed through a lot of takes.  You had to scream.  Yeah.  Well, maybe it was just doing comedy every night.  Which film?  Sidesplitters.  I love Sidesplitters.  Yeah, that was a funny one.  How long ago was that?  1999.  Get the fuck out of here.  If you've never checked out Sidesplitters, I love that fucking day.  Yeah, it's a 20-minute short.  Don't downplay it.  I think that was really good, man.  Win it, win it, win it, boo.  That's it for the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Well, gentlemen, another show.

[03:02:30]  So I'm talking that way because I have a son.  I just got back from San Diego.  I know, but it's like...  I flew in, we had dinner, and we're doing our podcast.  That's what's important, is to get the podcast out for the people.  Yes, God forbid.  Podcast for the people.  Go a day without hearing about...  You got a big piece of food in your teeth.  Your sinus is good.  It makes your teeth look rotten.  I worked a club in San Diego, the American Comedy Company.  Despite my sinus infection, I worked a club in San Diego.  As a comedian, there's no days off. 
[03:03:00]  If you're sick, you've still got to work.  I didn't have a sinus headache yesterday.  I got it today.  The club was great.  The staff was great.  In your bag?  Do I have any chocolate?  No.  But I'll go out for some after the podcast.  Really craving some chocolate?  I'm going to go out, take Raina Torita's or Fruity Yogurt, and we can go out for chocolate.  We haven't played tennis in a while.  We've been playing tennis.  No, we haven't been playing.  Because we haven't played in a while, but we used to play all the time. 
[03:03:30]  Okay, let's get started.  Those are broken.  We just got her those headphones.  Those are like brand new.  Well, they're almost a year old.  No, they're not a year old.  We got them at Marshalls.  Calm down.  Yes.  No.  I got them at Christmas time.  No.  Marshalls.  I remember when we got them.  She got them for Christmas.  Possibly from Santa.  What's broken?  How are they broken? 
[03:04:00]  Where is daddy's?  How are they broken?  Beside my bed.  In that box beside my bed.  But you don't need them.  You can just listen normal.  All right.  Well, I'm going to...  She's not going to be...  After tonight, she's not going to be able to use my headphones.  They're like $300 headphones.  Take her tonight.  That's a good thing.  Take her tonight and get her some new headphones.  We'll get her headphones.  I'll get her headphones.  I'll take her to Walmart or something. 
[03:04:30]  I always go to...  I love going to Walmart.  That'd be fun.  That'd be great.  Good times.  Okay, so...  Hang on a second.  What?  Well, anyhow.  So, I was in San Diego.  Great club.  Great staff.  Good crowds.  The hotel right across the street.  Beautiful Art Deco Hipster Hotel.  You know, with a nightclub on the roof. 
[03:05:00]  I had a suite.  It was beautiful.  It was nice.  Got off the plane Thursday.  It's hard to do a podcast with crying in the background.  I can't pause.  I don't know how.  Well, bring her upstairs and I'll talk.  They want to hear me.  These are my fans.  So, I get off the plane Thursday.  I rush to get a rental car.  Get the rental car.  Rush to Torrey Pines.  I play Torrey Pines and it eats me alive. 
[03:05:30]  It was a nightmare.  Uh, I guess it's also tough to play golf when you don't sleep and you're rushing around.  No excuse, though.  It, it, it killed me.  Like, the front nine, I shot a 49 and I just, I, I stopped keeping score in the back.  It was such a nightmare.  I do remember one hole.  I did get a nine, probably my first nine this year.  So, uh, but it was cool.  At least I could say I played Torrey Pines. 
[03:06:00]  Then I, uh, I did a show Thursday night, Thursday night, and it was a miscommunication with a time  and I did an hour and I thought I was doing 50 minutes and they got kind of upset that  I went over by 10 minutes and I guess they were pretty strict about their, uh, their time,  their time and their, and their lights there and the owner texts me, please respect our light.  And I'm going, what the fuck?  I killed.  It went great.  But then I met the owner the next night and he was, he was great. 
[03:06:30]  He's crazy, but he was great.  It's like one of my favorite club owners out of all of them.  He loved comedy.  This guy, you know, this is a club in San Diego, San Diego.  He loves all the East Coast comics.  You know, he, you know, he said,  Otto and George there.  He's had Norton there.  He loves East Coast comedy.  And, uh, you know, and, and San Diego isn't as uptight as the rest of, uh, you know, as 
[03:07:00]  all the other audiences I've ever worked in California.  You know, they get a little more uptight in San Francisco, LA, they're a little more  uptight.  But for some reason, San Diego, this club, they, uh, you know, Thursday night I was doing  a set and the DJ was saying, you know, you got to get, you got to get rougher.  That's what we want.  That's why we, uh, you know, we like about Rich Voss, get a little rougher with him, you  know?  And, uh, so no, I was telling, I'm telling him about, uh, my weekend. 
[03:07:30]  So I met the club owner.  He was great.  He's one of my favorite new club owners.  He's out of his mind, but he loves comedy.  He knows you.  He knows all the East Coast guys.  Well, boy, what a great, he knows who I am.  Although, even though I was in San Diego, I went nowhere.  Played golf a couple of days, went to my hotel, and I didn't walk around.  I'm glad you got to play golf.  What's that?  No, I'm glad you got to play golf.  Why?  Because you so rarely, uh, get to do it. 
[03:08:00]  Well, what else would I do on the road?  Tell me, give me.  I don't know.  What else would you do at home?  Give me some options.  What else would you do at home?  I do a lot of things at home.  See, I don't play golf every day when I'm at home.  I work.  I do whatever around the house.  You can't do that in a hotel room.  I should have wrote some roast jokes.  No, I'm saying, cause, oh, cause I just was, was like thinking you played golf on Raina's  birthday, so you're probably going somewhere where you wouldn't be able to play golf in a  while, but oh, really?  I woke up at seven. 
[03:08:30]  I played golf and I was home by 1130 on her birthday.  Are you going to get angry now?  Yeah, because that's what you've been, yeah, probably because you've been holding it in  because I wasn't going to the pool like you do on her birthday.  I don't go to the pool.  I can't sit out at the pool.  Okay.  Your son.  Okay.  Okay.  What?  I mean, you can stay all day outside playing golf.  I'm not sitting by a pool and I don't say it wasn't all day.  It was three hours because I made sure I was the first group out.  Okay.  Well, let me, let me clarify my statements then. 
[03:09:00]  You can't stay at the pool for 20 minutes, but you can stay outside in the sun playing  golf for three hours.  I'm not staying in the sun.  I'm in a cart.  I'm not sitting still at the pool.  Okay.  I play golf.  Well, you could sit under the awning at the pool.  Well, and just sweat away, just sitting there and you weren't, you guys weren't even at  the pool by the time I got home.  Okay.  Okay.  I mean, it's just, it's odd.  You're like, oh, who cares?  I went, you went, you played golf, you came home, you laid on the couch for an hour. 
[03:09:30]  No.  Yes.  Until.  Until.  Okay.  I don't care.  Whatever.  I spent the night.  We took her to dinner.  We went to the movies.  I heard her ask you for something to eat and you were like, couldn't get off the couch.  You're like, no.  She said, can I have an ice cream?  I said, go get it.  I said, go get it.  She goes, daddy, it's my birthday.  You're supposed to get me anything I want on my birthday.  So that's what you've been holding in for four days because I didn't get up and get her  ice cream?  No, I'm not.  I'm not holding anything in.  I'm actually telling you something right now.  I don't want to get in a fight about it.  You're overreacting to this. 
[03:10:00]  I'm not overreacting.  I thought it was funny when you got her a birthday card that said to my niece.  I miss, I didn't realize it said niece.  I know.  I laughed a lot about that.  So I mean, did you get her a card?  Did I go out of my way?  I got her a card.  I didn't realize.  You went out of your way and you got her a card.  Rich, I don't understand why you're getting so defensive about this unless you feel guilty  about something.  I don't feel guilty.  I planned her entire birthday party.  You didn't plan the night we went to eat and go to the movies?  Yes, I did.  No?  Yes, I did.  Did you look up at the times of the movie? 
[03:10:30]  Who cares?  I mean, I don't understand.  You do because you brought it up.  You said I played golf on her birthday.  No, I didn't.  Who brought it up?  You said I played golf on her birthday.  You were the one who said you got to play golf in San Diego.  Yeah.  I said, that's nice.  I put in a little dig.  Okay.  And now you're going to like overreact.  I'm not overreacting.  I see you going for the jugular.  I see you ready to jump and defend and go.  This is the podcast where I make Bonnie cry.  No, you're wrong.  No, that's what you want.  No, I don't.  I just brought something up.  Okay.  I played golf.  Yes, early that morning. 
[03:11:00]  And I'll play probably this Wednesday because one day a week, maybe I try to play at home  because I've been working.  Okay.  That was my only free day.  All right.  To play early in the morning.  Okay.  I've been driving back and forth from New York, working at nights.  I feel that I do get to reward myself once in a while.  Okay.  I have 20 something free rounds at a beautiful course here.  No one cares.  Go ahead. 
[03:11:30]  Play golf.  I don't understand why you're defending.  We do care because you always bring it up.  I don't care.  I think it's funny that you didn't see Raina for, you know, you've been working so much.  And then on her birthday, you went and played golf.  I thought it was funny.  No, don't act like I spent the whole day.  The way you tried it.  You know, you did.  We saw you at five o'clock when we went.  You lead the jury.  That's what you do.  No, I'm not leading the jury.  I got it.  You went and played golf.  You came home.  You were on the couch.  When did we see you?  When we went to go to Applebee's.  I don't care.  No.  Raina and I had a great time.  We also had a great time at Applebee's. 
[03:12:00]  And then we had a great time at the movies.  And I had a great time at Applebee's and at the movies.  I was a delight.  Great.  You're on board.  Good.  I don't understand why, like, oh, I had a better time at Applebee's than you.  I went out of my way and I got a card.  Okay.  Did you get a card?  Who says that?  Did you get a card?  No, because you made fun because I didn't see the word niece on it.  I said it was funny.  I was laughing my head off.  No, you were insinuating that I...  When it happened, when I read the card to Raina, who was laughing so hard? 
[03:12:30]  You were because I didn't see the word niece on it.  Okay.  So then why would you respond with, I went out of my way and got her a card.  Because you were saying...  You didn't.  Did you get her a card?  Because you said I got her a card.  Should I say, oh, I was the one who planned her entire birthday party.  Did you plan her entire birthday party?  No, I didn't.  Okay.  I mean, is that what you want?  This, like, weird...  No, but you were saying...  You're sensitive and defensive and that's on you.  That's because of whatever, however you feel.  You are sensitive and defensive. 
[03:13:00]  You know, you're going to try to make me cry.  I'm not trying to make you cry.  I'm just talking.  No.  Really, Rich?  You don't see me doing anything, going for a juggler vein or doing anything like that.  You are getting really defensive really quickly.  I got her a card.  Did you get her a card?  You're so passive-aggressive.  That's all you are.  Well, there's...  Because there's no way to be aggressive with you.  You are.  You will fucking take a person down.  You are.  You're right.  Because they try to take me down.  You will...  Yeah.  No, you won't look at it like, oh, maybe I should look at my behavior.  Oh, did I...  You act like you're perfect. 
[03:13:30]  You act like you never do anything wrong.  You act like you're, like, the best.  Go ahead and bring something up.  And then I will...  And then I'll either, you know, tell you I'm sorry or fix it or whatever.  We do what we got to do to make everything work, okay?  I work.  I run back and forth.  I'm here and there trying to, you know, keep everything together.  Nobody denies that you work.  All right.  So I get up and play at 8 o'clock.  I'm home by 11.30.  Yeah, on Raina's birthday. 
[03:14:00]  And I'm home by 11.30.  I was home 11.30 when you guys were at the supermarket.  11.30, 12 o'clock.  You guys were at the supermarket.  And getting her cake.  And I was on my way home by then, okay?  And then what did you do?  I came home.  I did whatever.  Work around here.  Work around here?  Whatever I had to do.  I don't know.  What did you do?  I probably had to make some arrangements for traveling or doing whatever I had to do.  And then, you know, set stuff up.  I'm on the phone. 
[03:14:30]  I'm trying to, you know, put this together, that together.  And then I lay down for one hour.  One hour.  That's it.  So, and even if I didn't play golf, I would lay down because I didn't sleep the night before.  I know.  Whenever you play golf, there's always, like, another reason why you're tired.  It's so weird.  It really is.  It's always, like, your back hurt, but not because of golf.  No, my back hurts.  It's funny.  Like, I know you won't be able to have fun with this because you're so defensive about it.  But it is like listening to a drug addict. 
[03:15:00]  It really is.  Like, all the reasons why golf is fine and that's not your problem.  And any problem that you have.  Well, how can it be a problem?  Because if you get up early and you play golf all day and the sun, of course, you're going to be tired.  I didn't play all day.  Which I said to you was going to happen.  And you're like, it's not because of that.  I didn't sleep very good the night before.  I didn't.  She kept kicking me.  I was just saying that's funny.  It's like a humorous thing.  It's always something other than golf.  It's not always.  You know, it's...  Like, one time I was like, I don't care about you playing golf.  It's the sleeping afterwards.  And you were like, I don't ever sleep after golf. 
[03:15:30]  And it was, like, so humorous because you always sleep after golf.  Not always.  Here we go.  Okay.  Not always.  Okay.  I suppose if there was something that you, Rich Voss, really wanted to do, you wouldn't.  I know because I'm just self-centered and...  Are you?  No.  No.  All I do is give.  You don't think so?  Oh, really?  What about TMZ?  Was that a giving moment?  Yeah.  Was that another thing?  I didn't try to get us on TMZ.  We didn't want to be on TMZ.  Well, in the beginning when I called, you had no problem with it.  It just took long.  Because it was going to be, like, this one moment of our lives. 
[03:16:00]  Okay.  So set it up, then.  I'll set it up.  We went to New York for, so Bonnie could get her passport.  I, okay, no.  Let me set it up.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Let me set it up.  Let me set it up.  She was going to go, and I went with her.  I was going in.  Raina and I had it planned for a long time that I was going to go to the Canadian consulate.  And get her passport that she hasn't accomplished in six months.  That she hasn't taken care of in over six months.  Is that passive-aggressive?  I don't know.  You just haven't done it in six months. 
[03:16:30]  I've been doing it the whole time.  It's so hard.  It can't be that hard.  A million people.  Yes, because I keep sending it away, and I keep getting it sent back.  Well, then, obviously, you're not doing something right.  That's exactly correct.  I'm not doing something right.  I'm doing something wrong.  Six months.  But go ahead.  So after, like, her 10th try getting her passport.  No, go ahead.  I'm just saying.  It wasn't the 10th try.  Well, whatever.  Should I go for the jugular now?  No.  Should I defend myself to God's end?  Do whatever you've got to do.  Should I start yelling at you until you cry?  No.  I'm not trying to yell at you.  I'm just setting up what, you know, because you see things your way, and I see things 
[03:17:00]  mine.  Okay.  That's fine.  You see me as a total incompetent.  No, I don't.  Not at all.  Not at all.  That's fine.  Oh, really?  That's what you drag it out to?  Really?  Well, obviously, you can't get it done in six months.  You wouldn't try.  You'll get it done.  You know, you'll find it.  You'll get it done.  I'm sure you've had it done before.  It's not like you've never had a passport.  You know, it's just you run into a lot of glitches with this one.  That's all.  What are you laughing at?  She's not.  She's crying.  She's been crying ever since I left her from upstairs. 
[03:17:30]  Why?  She wants to watch Netflix, and Netflix isn't working.  So she won't watch regular television, and so she's crying.  It's really not because of anything.  It's because last night, I told her she could stay up as late as she wanted, and the babysitter  took that as gospel.  And so when I got home at one o'clock, Raina was still awake.  Well, but you said you could stay up as late as you wanted.  I know, but I really thought she would fall asleep, obviously, you know, 10 o'clock.  Well, don't blame the babysitter.  I'm not blaming her, but I'm just saying, like, any normal person would have maybe made 
[03:18:00]  attempts.  And go against the wishes of the mom and the child?  At one o'clock, I mean...  As late as you want means as late as you want.  And the little killer...  First of all, I didn't tell the babysitter.  I told Raina.  So Raina's on the babysitter.  Come here, I'm going to tell you what we'll do.  Come here.  Why don't you do the podcast with Raina?  I'm just not into it tonight.  I can't do it.  You're never into it.  I know, because I just...  It's like this weird...  I'm talking to, like, a brick wall.  You're not listening.  He just all only wants to, like, hurt. 
[03:18:30]  Are you kidding me?  I didn't come on here with anything negative.  Anything negative brought to this podcast, say, was from you.  No, you don't.  You just...  You walk through life, and then...  I walk through life?  Really?  That's what I do?  I just walk through life?  That you're going to get defensive about?  Me saying that you walk through life?  That's what you're going to...  You're going to defend that?  Like, I mean, what...  I don't get it.  Because, obviously, you don't...  You run through life.  Is that better?  No, I work hard through...  You skip through life.  Okay.  You skip through life? 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, I like skip it.  Yes.  I mean, do you see what I'm saying?  It's like...  I tried to get on TMZ, and it took longer...  Oh, it wasn't...  It took long and expected.  It's that you asked to come.  You're like, I want to come.  Okay, fine.  But then what you do is that you...  I said, can I come?  I want to come.  Okay, then you try to control everything.  You don't just let...  Oh, you're coming on our day.  So, then all of a sudden, we had to change when we were going into the city.  No, you didn't.  You're the one who said, we'll go in at 10, 30, 11.  You did.  No, you kept saying, you go, let me sleep in at least one day.  No, and then you said... 
[03:19:30]  You said...  Because I had to figure out, because the consulate is closed between 12 and 1.  Yeah, so you said, we'll leave at 11.  That's what you said.  After you said you wanted to sleep in.  An hour.  I said, sleep in an extra hour.  What's the difference?  We were going.  There was no time limit.  Do you not, like, ever in any way go, oh, I did change that.  That was my change.  I made a suggestion, and you said, okay.  You were the one who changed it.  You did.  Okay.  I can't.  See, I can't do it.  I'm not talking to you anymore.  I'm not.  Everything was my fault. 
[03:20:00]  I knew she was my fault.  You were great.  You tried to get us on TMZ.  I was being a little baby about it, because it took over an hour.  It did.  I was like, I was all, and this is supposed to be Raina's day, because we were going to go to  American Doll.  We did go, and it was fine.  And Raina was, like, being a little bitch baby about it.  Like, we were sitting on the fucking corner of the street waiting for TMZ, which I was  being such an ungrateful bitch, because I didn't want to be on TV when you were, like,  looking out for me.  Oh, come on, Raina.  Why can't you fucking hang out and just be a good kid? 
[03:20:30]  Mommy and Daddy are about to get famous, and why didn't we just fucking...  I don't understand why we couldn't just be, like, so grateful to you that whole time.  Like, you're the best.  Why are you...  You look out for us.  You make sure that we're...  I mean, who cares about Raina's day?  Am I right?  All right, go ahead and say exaggeration.  So then we go, finally, TMZ shows up.  We don't get on TMZ, by the way.  I mean, I didn't watch the show, but we would have had at least one person tweet us. 
[03:21:00]  And then...  We went to the...  So then we went to the American Girl doll store, which, once again, I was, like, trying  to be in a good mood and stuff, which was so silly of me.  Why did I try to do that?  When you were so brave in pointing out what a fucking money trap that place is.  No, I said it was good.  I said it was smart.  No, you were right.  You told us over and over again what a racket this time was.  No, I just said it was good. 
[03:21:30]  You kept saying, like, what are these dolls made out of?  I did not say that once.  Quit exaggerating.  You let us know that we were being taken.  No.  Oh, really?  I didn't have to tell you that.  You knew that.  She got the doll she loved.  That's all that matters.  But we got in and got out, thanks to you.  Because if it was just her and I, we might have stayed there and had lunch and done weird  stuff and looked around.  No, you couldn't have had lunch because you didn't make reservations.  Because, again, you didn't look into it.  Because, again, I didn't look into it.  You didn't look into it.  It's my fault.  They told us just to wait there.  No, yeah. 
[03:22:00]  They told us to see.  You have 15 minutes, they said.  And you saw the line around the corner for lunch for the reservations.  But you didn't take time to call.  Well, if you weren't there, Rich, we would have stayed and waited and seen.  15 minutes.  We could have waited to see if there was a table.  That's fine.  That's fine.  Like, yeah, you're right.  I was stupid.  I didn't make a reservation.  No, you weren't stupid.  You just overlooked it.  No, you're smart.  I am smart.  I take care of what's got to be changed.  You kept saying blocks instead of avenues when I corrected you.  You got so mad at me, which you were right to do. 
[03:22:30]  You were right to do.  Because you know New York so much.  You know New York like the back of your hand.  You call me every...  I don't.  That's why I'm an idiot.  You call me.  Why should I question you of all people?  How do I get out of here?  Where do I leave?  How do I leave the tunnel?  How do I get out?  Where do I go?  You need a GPS to get out of New York.  And you're telling me blocks and avenues.  Like, I don't know the difference.  Like, I've never been here.  But you kept saying it's only three blocks when it was three avenues.  So, a big deal is...  Because avenues are so much longer than blocks.  They're like three blocks in each one. 
[03:23:00]  No, not everyone's three blocks.  Between 8th and 9th is not three blocks.  Okay?  Between, you know, they're longer, but they're not three blocks.  Well, once again, you're right.  I shouldn't have said anything.  I should get my non-show.  Okay, well, whatever.  Or, you know, obviously you're not a happy person.  So, you know, this is how it's going to go down.  I play golf once in a while.  Okay?  And that's how it is.  I go to work.  You want to go get up tomorrow and drive to Brooklyn and sit there all day? 
[03:23:30]  Okay?  You think this is the summer, you know, the slowest part of the year for comedy.  I have not, like...  I've never one time said don't go to work.  I've never brought it.  But I'm trying to squeeze everything in.  I'm trying to squeeze everything in.  When I say let me sleep an extra hour before we go to New York, it's maybe because I'm  exhausted from doing everything.  Okay?  So we did.  So don't bring it.  Don't throw it back in my face that I say can I sleep an extra hour.  I'm not throwing it back in your face.  Bullshit.  I'm saying the whole...  Bullshit.  It's not just that, Rich.  It's the whole day.  Stop. 
[03:24:00]  Do you want to talk about it or do you want to get angry and be right?  No, because...  Do you want to be right or do you want to discuss?  No, I don't want to be right.  I just want to...  You're already...  No, let me...  Look at you.  You started getting...  You're ready to fucking take me down.  I'm not at all.  Yes, you are.  That's how you are.  You're like...  You don't tell the TMZ story.  We were in Midtown.  Listen, we were in Midtown.  I'll tell the story.  No, everything that you did that day became like you controlling things.  And if somebody else tried to take the reins, you got very, very angry.  That's why we don't like doing things with you. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, we don't really?  That's a good plant to see it in her head.  That's good.  That's good.  It's easier to just do our own thing.  Go upstairs and watch TV, please, while we do this, our radio show.  What?  Just pause.  I don't understand why you won't pause it.  Just pause it.  I don't know how to pause.  If we lose this one, it's absolutely perfect.  That's the pause.  Is this going now? 
[03:25:00]  Is it going?  I think it...  I hit pause because I took a...  Bond and I were getting a little heated there, and we don't want to do that.  We don't want to put that out there.  So I hit pause, and I took Raina out to Fruity Yogurt for some ice cream, and I got some ice cream.  Let me tell you about ice cream.  When you have a sinus headache and then brain freeze on top of that, you feel like it's going to explode.  I will clear up one thing so we can move on, the whole TMZ thing, so I can make this clear to everybody that I wasn't being selfish. 
[03:25:30]  I'm going to clear this up.  Are you setting it up?  Yes.  I'm going to explain the TMZ thing and then move on.  This guy put us on TMZ once.  I know him.  Then he filmed me two other times, and it just...  One time I would have made it.  They're ready to put me on, and then stupid Lindsay Lohan did something and got arrested, and I got bumped. 
[03:26:00]  And I guess the third time, it just...  They didn't use it.  It might have stunk.  Anyhow, so we're in New York, and we're right by the TMZ office.  So I text him and say,  Bonnie and I are in town.  Do you want us to shoot anything?  And he goes, I'll get back to you.  Then he gets back.  He goes, where are you at?  I go, we're right on, like, 50th and 6th Avenue.  He goes, good, yeah. 
[03:26:30]  We'll do something.  I'll send somebody there.  So I asked him.  So then he texts me and says, the guy will be there.  He's on his way up.  He'll be there in 20 minutes.  Okay.  Anyhow, the guy took an hour.  That's why the whole thing was a nightmare.  The guy was in town.  But I couldn't text him back and go, hey, we're fucking blowing this off.  Because I asked him to do it.  He said, okay.  And he sent a cameraman who came all the way from Soho back to Midtown. 
[03:27:00]  So I'm not going to go, oh, well, hey, you know, it's taking too long.  We're leaving.  Because they film celebrities all day.  You know, and I asked him.  If he would have called me and said, hey, can you shoot something for TMZ?  And I would have said yes.  And then if it took an hour, I would have said, hey, look, I got to go.  Because he would have called me.  But I called him and asked for him to shoot.  That's the only reason I stayed there. 
[03:27:30]  Okay.  I wasn't, I didn't plan it to be an hour wait.  Okay.  I didn't plan it to soak up the day or part of the day.  I was just looking out for us.  I figure me and Bonnie are in Midtown.  They like, the guy Harvey loves me and her together.  So I try to take advantage of it.  That's all.  And it just kind of didn't go the way as planned.  But it put a monkey wrench into the day.  An hour monkey wrench. 
[03:28:00]  Which wasn't, it wasn't, you know, out of malice or anything like that.  No one thought that you were doing it out of malice.  Oh, I'm going to get them.  Well, I'm just, I was just looking.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  I was just looking.  Look, you can't go to American Girl doll.  Okay.  I mean, that would have been truly evil.  Okay, so that's what happened with that.  Now, number two, when we're at American Girl, I was, I just go, all I said to American Girl  going, I said was, what a, this place is unbelievable. 
[03:28:30]  What a racket they have.  I didn't, I wasn't being negative.  I'm going, it's a great business.  They're getting $120 for a doll.  Rich, this is, I think like, okay, like, without you getting like super angry about it, keep  your sense of humor, but I don't think you realize the amount of like, your character  is based in a person that like, is sort of angry and like negative, right? 
[03:29:00]  I, like, if you were just going to explain your character on stage, all your jokes are  about like, this, these people are going to take you, this, this is where they get  you.  Yeah.  That sort of thing.  Okay.  Well, in real life, you're that person too.  Okay.  Yes.  Because that's who I am on stage.  I'm me.  I don't try to put on some character.  I bring me to wherever I go.  Great.  Great.  So just stop patting yourself on the back for one minute while I finish this. 
[03:29:30]  Try to stop trying to what?  Pat yourself on the back for one minute.  I didn't pat myself on the back.  I just said, I'm me wherever I go.  I don't do, I'm not emo Phillips.  I don't do a character.  I'm me.  I don't.  Okay.  My point is.  Why do you call it?  What do you think?  I'm emo Phillips?  Right.  But when you look back at your own behavior, these things you say to yourself, you always  say, I wasn't like that.  I'm not like that.  I didn't do that.  But yet you're saying to me right now that that character that you are on stage is the same  character that you are off stage. 
[03:30:00]  So it is, it stands to reason that you are.  No, I say a lot of positive things on stage.  Oh, now you're changing who your character is.  We just agreed.  No, but I'm not Nikki negative the whole time.  If I go into a business and I go.  I'm not saying you're Nikki negative, but you like to point out things that.  I point out a good thing.  But that's not a fun way to be in life when you're trying to take your daughter to her  favorite store that she's been talking about for six months.  First of all, how do you exaggerate so much?  It's not been six months. 
[03:30:30]  She wasn't talking about it for six months.  She's been wanting an American Girl doll for a very, very long time.  But she wasn't talking about it for six months.  Yes, yes, yes.  Oh my God.  Yes, because she saw Rebecca's.  That wasn't six months ago.  That was a couple weeks ago.  Again, a couple.  You don't know.  That's the thing.  I don't want to be like, I don't want to try to tear apart your, you know, whatever.  But you're not around all the time.  You're right.  She talks about American Girl doll.  All I'm saying is if I go into a business, if I go into a restaurant that's packed, I 
[03:31:00]  go, wow, this place is a booming.  They got a great business here.  Red, you know what you're doing.  Stop.  No, I wasn't.  I was going, holy shit.  Look at what you're doing.  Well, I really misread you then.  I was going, look at all these people in here.  What a racket.  It's unbelievable.  That's all.  Right.  That's not negative.  I'm going to say what a racket from now on.  I should try to remember that that's a positive statement.  It's not positive.  It's a, holy shit.  I, I wish I would have thought of something like $120 dolls that people from all over the 
[03:31:30]  world, once they come to New York, go to this store.  It's, you know, when you can't get into the restaurant, when there's a line and you need  reservations into the fucking American Girl restaurant.  Okay.  Well, the way you're saying the fucking American Girl restaurant.  I'm just saying that's a big, it's, it's a smart business.  This is the thing is that it's like, it's like I was also preaching to, to someone who  I already know.  So I don't know what my thing is that I'm supposed to do. 
[03:32:00]  Am I supposed to indulge you and be like, I know this place is shit.  I didn't say it was shit.  I didn't say it was shit.  I said it was a good business.  I never once said it was shit.  Drop it.  But I didn't say it was shit.  You're putting words in my mouth.  I'm going, holy shit, look at this place.  Oh, holy shit.  Okay.  I'm going, no.  Well, holy, look how this place is packed.  Don't try to draw the word shit.  No.  Even if I said shit, holy shit.  Did you or did you not say shit?  I don't even know.  I'm going, holy shit.  No, but whatever.  You know what I'm saying.  I'm saying it's packed and you can go, you go, you're right. 
[03:32:30]  That's a good business.  I'm not saying just about the American Girl law.  I'm saying in life, am I supposed to just indulge those things?  If you agree with it or disagree.  I don't know if we're supposed to then both be like little negative Nellies.  No, you don't have to agree.  You could say.  Or if I say something positive, oh, I'm always on the other side.  I'm trying to find some balance in it.  No, it's not, but it's a statement.  That's all it is.  There's no point in time here ever.  That's like Twitter.  That's like going, holy shit, I wish I invented Twitter.  What a marketing genius, the person who invented Twitter. 
[03:33:00]  Okay?  That's not negative.  That's not positive.  I really apologize because I totally misunderstood when you were picking everything up and looking  at the prices and freaking out.  Yeah, when I'm going, holy crap, the little doll in that store.  I don't remember you ever being like, this, Raina, isn't this amazing?  Look at all the dolls.  It's amazing.  I did.  I said it's cool to Raina.  I kept saying this place is cool to her. 
[03:33:30]  Okay.  I kept, to her, I go, how cool is this?  Look at all these cool things.  To myself, I'm going, what a racket.  Okay?  And also to me a couple of times.  But it's not negative.  It's just, it is what it is.  It is.  See?  You just don't get things.  You don't get them.  What are you talking about?  I get trying to have a happy day for my kids.  I know.  I was saying to her how great it was.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Let's go.  I never once said, let's leave that store.  Not once.  I said, let's go.  I said, we're hungry. 
[03:34:00]  Everybody said, we're hungry.  But I never once said, let's leave.  Don't make a face like I'm lying.  Not once.  That's the face you're going to have when I punch you in the mouth.  I never once said, let's go.  When did I ever say, let's go?  Tell me one time.  I didn't say, let's go.  I said, we're hungry.  And we couldn't get in a restaurant because you didn't make a reservation.  And you even made a joke about it.  Like, oh, like this fucking plate.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  How about your joke?  Oh, look at this.  Some five-star restaurant.  Look at the attitude on her. 
[03:34:30]  You know.  She was kind of funny, right?  Yeah, but see, it's okay.  See, like, let's turn.  But you do the same thing.  Well, I feel like I'm being funny and you're being, like, you're bringing everybody down  all the time.  I can't, like, constantly be the person that's like, yay, this is fun.  Like, it's like when your daughter was like, we were going to the, um, uh, we were all decided  because Rich was not going to be there and neither were, uh, the, the other girls, um, 
[03:35:00]  Jessica and Ellen.  And so we're going to go for dinner and then go to the Smurfs 2 for Raina's birthday.  And then Ellen goes, you know what?  I'm not going to go to Smurfs 2 because it's, like, not really my kind of movie.  It's like, yeah, it's, it's not, nobody's kind of movie over the age of six.  Okay.  So, yeah, we're doing this for Raina.  But if you went to that movie and then you're just like a normal person, if you were to react  like, like the way that you would, if it was just you and I having to sit through, we'd 
[03:35:30]  be like, oh my God, this is garbage.  This is terrible.  I loved it.  Rich, please try to understand what I'm saying.  You wouldn't do that because you want your daughter to have a good time.  So you're like, isn't it funny?  This is so funny.  That's what I kept saying to her.  But you don't really think it's so funny.  You don't think I kept saying to her that at the movies?  I don't know how to act with a kid.  Rich, this is the problem with you, is that you're so, like, literal.  Like, you can't extract what I'm saying about the Smurfs to the American Girl about things.  Yes, I can.  You're saying that I, you're saying.  I'm saying that, like, you don't say the things constantly, the downer stuff that, of 
[03:36:00]  course, adults get.  This isn't, like, this is weird or this is, you know, overpriced or this is, but that's,  you let it go because you're trying to have a good time for your kids.  That's why I kept saying to her.  This is cool.  Are you having fun?  You didn't hear, well, you don't, you don't hear me when I'm talking.  Because you were up in the bathroom.  You sound, honestly, like you're crazy.  No.  Like, you're out of your mind right now.  Yeah, because you're like, everything that gets said, you're like, that's why I was doing 
[03:36:30]  this.  Well, you were saying this.  No.  You were negative about that.  Well, I didn't do that.  Well, I was, I was saying in a positive way that it's a racket.  I was saying, I wish I did do it.  Like, everyone knows who you are.  Everyone knows that you're Rich Voss and that you weren't sitting around being like, what  a wonderful racket.  Like, are you kidding me?  No.  Like, who are you fooling right now?  Is it you in your own head?  No. 
[03:37:00]  Look, I could say.  Try to break it down in the most real terms possible, how you think you were behaving.  All I know is when I was with her alone, I was going, how cool is this?  What, you know, saying nothing but positive.  I didn't go to Raina.  Hey, this place is a racket.  What a ripple.  I didn't, hey, you know what?  This is unbelievable.  Who was going to pay this?  Let's go get 10 other dolls for half price.  And I said to her, I was saying, hey, this is fun.  This is cool.  Do you like the dolls?  But as an adult, I turned to another adult and go, man, this place is a racket.  What a fucking scam.  That's the difference. 
[03:37:30]  I didn't do it to my kid.  But you had to be just like that, but you weren't.  I was.  Well, you think I was yelling it out loud?  It's hard.  Sometimes you're just so like.  You're the one yelling at the girl who wouldn't let us into the restaurant almost.  I never yelled one second.  No, I did not.  You're going.  You said to her, what do you mean?  You said, if we wait 50.  I agree.  That's how it's true.  She said, if you wait 50 minutes, you better find out.  And I said, I don't understand.  This is exactly what I said.  I said, I don't understand.  Are there reservations?  You said, are we guaranteed if we wait 15 minutes? 
[03:38:00]  You said that to her.  Are you guaranteed?  Yeah.  Well, is that yelling?  I was trying to understand what she was telling me.  Oh, my God.  What should I understand?  Wait 15 minutes?  I didn't understand.  I didn't know that line at which you pointed out afterwards was for the restaurant.  I thought people were already in there.  So I didn't see tables full.  So I was like, but that's because I just hadn't opened it yet for the afternoon session  or whatever.  No, I didn't understand what was happening.  That's why I asked those questions.  You shouldn't have yelled at her.  I did not yell at her. 
[03:38:30]  She's just doing her job.  I was completely lovely.  She said to you, you have to wait 15.  You're like, 15 minutes?  Well, what is that?  Dude, is that guaranteed as a spot?  Well, I don't know.  I didn't say it like that.  I said, what happens after?  I go, why 15 minutes?  Well, you don't hear yourself.  How are you on stage?  Are you like that on stage?  I mean, think about it.  Yeah, no, I'm not like a fucking ass on stage.  Are you kidding me?  You made people cry?  No.  A guy brings you a gift?  I'm not doing this.  Whatever.  If you have an honest-to-God beef with me, you may absolutely bring it up. 
[03:39:00]  But this, like, you're an ass.  No, you're an ass.  I'm not doing that.  I'm not doing it either.  But don't...  No, I was bringing up some of your behavior and trying to make it actually entertaining  and light, but you can't do that.  As you get older, every single year that you get older, you have less and less sense  of humor about yourself.  You take yourself so seriously that you couldn't possibly make this humorous if you wanted to.  I'm...  First of all, I'm not trying to make it humorous. 
[03:39:30]  I'm trying to explain, like, when you brought up the TMZ thing, you didn't explain to them  the situation I was in.  You know, it just made it look like, hey...  Well, I...  Personally, if you really want to know my side of things, honestly, and whatever, if a guy  had said he'll be there in 20 minutes and it was 30 minutes, I would have texted him  back and said, listen, I'm with my daughter.  I gotta go.  But I called him.  If you called...  It doesn't matter.  I still would have been like...  No, you wouldn't have...  Not if you called somebody and said, hey...  I wouldn't care.  It's TMZ.  I wouldn't have cared. 
[03:40:00]  Yeah, it's not true.  I wouldn't have cared.  I swear to God.  That's why you don't even know who I am at all.  Yeah, it's not true.  You'll rush to do a free room somewhere and won't cancel even if you're running late or  something and...  Do I?  Is that true?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, like sometimes you take these gigs so seriously and I'm going, well, it doesn't  pay, this and that.  You go, well, I said I'd do it.  You committed to it and that's what happened.  I called him...  Okay, we don't need to go over it again.  I just told you my side.  If you want to tell your side for the fourth time, you may absolutely do that. 
[03:40:30]  It's not the fourth time.  I told it one time.  I told it one time.  You told it...  Okay.  One time.  The story.  What happened?  One time.  Then you just did it again.  Well, I'm just saying, I was just trying to correct, you make me look like I'm some ogre.  I was really looking out for us.  I don't make you...  No, no.  I was looking out for us.  I bring up the stories and then you sink your own ship, buddy.  I sink my own ship.  That's what I do.  I didn't...  You...  You know, like if I didn't explain the whole TMZ thing, people would go, what kind of guy 
[03:41:00]  would drag his family in to make him wait to do TMZ?  They're still thinking that.  No, they're not.  They're still thinking that.  They're seeing that...  Yes, they don't.  First of all, they're like, if you're with your family, why would you call TMZ anyway?  Actually, what they're thinking is, you call TMZ?  Yeah.  Don't they just fucking happen upon you on the street?  Yeah, they think that you just get happened upon on the street.  No, I know.  I go, if you want to shoot something, comics, they shoot things.  If you're Jay-Z or... 
[03:41:30]  You're not calling TMZ.  Or Phil Mickelson, you know, they just walk up to you.  But if you're comics, they shoot stuff with comics all the time in L.A. and New York.  The guy, Harvey, who's that guy, likes you and I together.  So I called the guy I know and said, we're together in New York.  Do you get it?  We...  You want to...  That's what I'm saying.  You just keep going over the same thing over and over. 
[03:42:00]  People are still, I guarantee you, being like, well, if it's your daughter's day in New York,  why are you calling TMZ?  Because I thought it would take 10 minutes because we were around the corner from her.  Right, so then when it took an hour, why didn't you get out of it?  And I was trying to get my daughter on TMZ on her birthday, too.  Okay, your daughter doesn't care.  If she saw herself on TV that night.  That's your...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You want to be on television so bad...  No, I don't.  ...that you projected it onto everyone else in your family.  That's not what you're kidding me.  And no one else in your family cares that much. 
[03:42:30]  I don't want to be on TV that bad.  I turn down TV all the time.  You know I turn down TV.  Stop, Rick.  I don't turn down TV.  Okay, free tattoo.  You're the mean guy on...  Oh, really?  Would you rather, or whatever it is.  Oh, yeah.  How many times have I turned down Joey Behar, or turned down, you know, whatever, the one on Fox?  I turn down TV all the time if it's not convenient.  Okay, I went on...  Well, that one wasn't convenient.  It would have been because they're around the corner.  I'm not talking about it anymore.  But it would have been.  They're right around the corner. 
[03:43:00]  It would have been.  If it had taken 10 minutes.  But it didn't.  So then you pull the plug on it.  You say, hey, sorry I contacted you.  I really don't have time to do this.  Or you let Rain and I go on to American Doll, which we asked to do a couple of times, and you said no.  All right, let's just drop it.  We agree to disagree.  That's what they say.  People go, we agree to disagree.  That's all.  We agree.  We just, it didn't work out the way I wanted it to.  That's all.  It just didn't work out.  But I never...  But you know what it is, like the aggravating part of it, is that you always try to couch it in. 
[03:43:30]  I was doing it for you.  I didn't say you, for us.  Just now, you were like, I was doing it for Raina.  Well, no.  It's so ludicrous.  Rich, at least be honest.  You were doing it for you.  No, that's not true.  You wanted to be on TMZ.  No, I wanted all of us to be on TMZ.  It would have been a good shot.  That's as close as we're going to get, folks.  All of us to be.  He wanted all of us to be on TMZ.  Okay.  Okay.  Can you imagine on her birthday, if she would have looked on TMZ?  No, she wouldn't have cared.  Yes, she would have. 
[03:44:00]  She would have lost her mind.  Rich, no, she wouldn't.  I'm telling you, it doesn't.  No, I'm telling you.  You're trying to put in the head of a six-year-old that she's like obsessed with being on TMZ.  She's not obsessed.  It would have been cool.  I didn't say she was obsessed.  It would have been cool.  That's all?  You don't think so?  No.  No?  On her birthday, if she saw herself on TMZ, you don't think that would have been cool?  Yes or no?  I don't think she would have cared as much as you think that she would.  I think she would have loved it. 
[03:44:30]  It would have been exactly the same as you'd taken a video of her and showed it to her.  That's the same amount.  Yes.  She doesn't even understand it.  Are you kidding me?  Her friend, she saw her friend on TV and flipped out.  Remember?  No, she didn't see her friend on TV.  Her friend told her that she did a commercial for Disneyland and got to go to Disneyland.  And she goes, I want to do that.  I said, you want to do a commercial?  And she thought about it for a second.  She goes, no, just go to Disneyland.  Yeah. 
[03:45:00]  See?  No.  I don't see.  When she watches that show and John Doerr is the voice, and then we told her, she was  pretty excited about that.  He's not the voice.  He's actually on it.  Yeah, he's on the show.  And then she saw it.  Dinosaur Dan.  And she was pretty excited.  Dino Dan.  She's excited about that.  Not really.  Not that much.  I mean, a little bit.  As long as I thought on her birthday, it'd be sweet to get everybody on TV.  But when you saw her hating having to sit there. 
[03:45:30]  But then I got her ice cream, and we walked around me and her.  We had fun walking around the park.  Okay.  We did.  And then we went there, and I never once said-  You just won't budge, will you?  No, not on that, because I was looking out.  I wasn't-  It wasn't selfish in any way possible.  Oh, my God.  In any way.  I know for a fact that there has to be people out there that are like, is she delusional?  He must be delusional.  I could call TMZ anytime and say I'm in New York.  I've been on the Chris Rock movie 10 or 15 times in New York. 
[03:46:00]  I never called TMZ.  I mean, it makes no sense to me.  So I didn't want to do it.  Raina didn't want to do it, but you were doing it for us.  No, you wanted to do it if it were to take you 10 minutes.  First of all, no, that's not true.  You said go ahead, call him.  There's so many things that I do just because you want to do it.  When you said I called TMZ, I was like, that's fine.  I said, should I call TMZ?  I immediately was like, ugh, I look horrible.  I got to do this.  No, I said, should I call him?  You said, okay.  I didn't do it without you knowing.  I would never do that.  I don't remember the events, but-  If it went the way I planned, it would have been fine. 
[03:46:30]  That's all.  It would have been fine.  It would have been fine.  Why didn't you pull the plug?  Because I asked him.  He didn't ask me.  You can still pull the plug.  No, you can't.  When you say, hey, we'll do something, and he sends somebody from Soho to Midtown, and  that guy's coming up in a cab-  When he lies about the time by that much.  He didn't lie.  He just thought it would take 20 minutes.  It should have, but the guy hit traffic.  That's all.  If he didn't send the guy from Soho up, people understand. 
[03:47:00]  I called him.  He sent one of his cameramen.  I can't talk about that anymore.  All right, so-  Are we done?  No.  Have we done enough time?  We must have.  What's the time?  Like five more minutes.  Then talk about something else.  All right.  I can't go over this again.  All right.  It seems like we're just getting more.  If you mind when I'm upset with things that you do, I will just ignore you for a week, and  then we'll pick up.  Then I'll have given myself some distance. 
[03:47:30]  You'll maybe psychologically either think we're getting along really well, or that you've done  something wrong, and you'll try to figure it out.  But I can't do these back-and-forth weird fights, because I feel like-  Well, you don't think I like doing them?  Well, it's so weird.  I feel like-  I'm tired of trying to help out and get blamed for being an ogre for looking out.  But that's just-  It's the thing-  I can't look out-  I don't want to use this word again, but it is so much about control. 
[03:48:00]  It's not.  You know what?  From now on, I won't look out then.  I'll just look out-  But see, this is such a black and white thing.  Well, that's what you just said.  I'm doing what you just said.  From now on, I will only look out for me and Raina.  I'll just look out for us, what's fine for me and the kid.  What are you talking about?  Well, you just said you won't talk to me for a week or do whatever.  I said this instead so that we don't have to have these weird fights.  No, you just said I won't talk to you.  We had the long fight and it ends up being nothing anyway.  There ends up being no resolve.  You said if I disagree with him, I just won't talk to him for a week.  So if I see that I'm doing something and not getting- 
[03:48:30]  But I never said I'm not going to look out for my husband.  Oh yeah, I'm only going to make dinners now for Raina and I.  No, you just said you're not going to talk to me for a week.  Didn't you just say that?  Is that what you just said?  Yeah, because the point being that I don't want to have these long, drawn-out arguments  where nothing gets resolved.  Doesn't it seem easier just to not have that same amount of time, be not talking at all?  And then you're still in the same place, but at least you haven't had a fucking huge- 
[03:49:00]  No, but the problem is-  You haven't wasted all this energy.  You don't talk about it.  You only see things from one side.  You see, we went into New York to do this.  He did this and it was a disaster.  But you don't see the fact that the way I tried to do it, it wouldn't have been a disaster  if it worked out the way I thought it would.  And I asked you, should I call them?  But it didn't turn out the way you expected or I expected.  So then instead of going, oh, fuck, he tried, but it was kind of a headache.  Instead of saying that, you go, what a fucking asshole. 
[03:49:30]  No, I didn't say what's it.  No, he keeps us hostage for an hour.  You make it completely negative.  But if that thing would, if they would have came from around the corner in 10 minutes-  No, he's famous right now.  We'd be living in a new mansion.  No, no, no.  See what I mean?  If he would have came from where they were-  I know, you're making it seem like-  No, and shot in-  It still would have been anything.  It would have been nothing.  Oh, really?  The time we were on TMZ last time, you didn't call your family?  You didn't call people?  No.  And go, hey, we're on-  Bullshit.  I did not call my family.  Yes, that's not true.  You did. 
[03:50:00]  I did not call my family.  You called your sister and said-  No, I didn't.  You did too.  No, I didn't.  I heard you telling people we were on TMZ.  I heard you.  They may be some of my friends, but I never-  Okay.  I never called my family.  You did.  You called your sister.  I'm sure they don't get it in Canada anyway.  You called her.  You talked to Andrea.  No, I did not.  No, I did not.  Yes.  You would have probably talked to Andrea if she was talking to you, but you talked to  Andrea.  No, I didn't.  Also, I'm saying, if the guy would have came in 10 minutes, shot it, and we were on,  it would have been perfect.  That's all.  And that's all I was trying to do was do something nice.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I appreciate it. 
[03:50:30]  So you don't?  I do.  I actually appreciate all the things that you do.  The problem is that you're so focused.  When things start going wrong, you just start getting mad at everyone.  I wasn't mad that day.  You never once were like, I'm sorry.  I did too.  No, you didn't.  I said, yeah.  Oh, I did.  I said many times, I'm sorry.  I can't do this.  I don't like people knowing shit about me now.  This podcast makes it so people know real stuff about me.  I've designed my entire act so that nothing real really happens up there. 
[03:51:00]  I talk about things that are going on, perhaps in the world, or thoughts that I might have.  But I don't sit around talking about my relationship.  And then I have to do this podcast.  So for now, we'll just talk.  It's just like this ugly, disgusting, stupid, petty fucking arguments that I have with my husband.  It's just like it's so intimate and gross. 
[03:51:30]  If my neighbors overheard this, I'd be fucking humiliated.  If we're talking in a restaurant and people overhear us, I'm like mortified.  Like, what am I doing?  You're always like, talk up.  No one can hear you.  You're like this.  Look at the guy with the toupee.  I'm like, stop.  I never said that.  You said that.  I'm just using that as an example, Mr. Literate, where you will say things very loudly because you think, I don't know, we're just different people. 
[03:52:00]  And it's like, it makes me like so ill.  Like sometimes when we do the podcast, it's actually fun and there's funny things.  And if I feel like, oh, well, we were being silly and funny, that's fine.  Like when we did the quiz, that was funny.  But we're just having like an argument.  It's so gross.  It's not an argument.  It's a disagree.  It's just so horrible.  It's a discussion.  And I'm sure you're trying to make me.  I don't want people to know me.  And I don't want you to know me.  And I don't want.  Yeah.  No one can know you.  No, I don't want anyone to know me.  And I don't want to be having a fight. 
[03:52:30]  It's not a fight.  Especially like just disagreement.  I know, but it's a horrible, like, it's so petty and gross.  If I overheard other people having this argument, I would want to bash both their heads.  I'd help them.  I'd help them.  I'd help them as like a counselor.  And what would you say to them?  I would go, look at your, I would say if, if, if it was a lady and a man and it was exactly  us, I would go to lady.  Look, he was just trying, maybe give the guy a little slack.  You know, the guy's exhausted.  And he's running all over. 
[03:53:00]  And I would say to the guy, oh, why do you have to go on their day and try to control  everything?  I didn't try to control.  You always think I'm trying to control.  I'm not trying to control.  Yeah, you are.  You're always like, because that's what you do.  You always have to add, like, you think that if there's no friction, that it's not a fun  time.  I got to hand it to the kid.  She never budged.  I only asked her twice.  When she picked Applebee's.  And she didn't even know there was going to be a birthday song.  It turned out very well, didn't it?  You know what Raina said after?  They come by, they bring the happy birthday, the Sunday. 
[03:53:30]  She had a few noodles left.  They took her noodles away.  And then afterwards she was like, why did they take my noodles away?  She was pissed.  They bring her a free son.
