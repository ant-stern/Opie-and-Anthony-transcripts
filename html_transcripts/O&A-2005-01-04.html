<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a song followed by jarring audio clips expressing negativity.  Jimmy Norton is in studio.  A lengthy, contentious phone call with frequent caller "Lady Di" ensues.  The hosts relentlessly mock Lady Di's appearance, lifestyle, and perceived lack of contribution to the show, questioning her sobriety and accusing her of lying.  Lady Di responds with rambling, nonsensical statements.  A seemingly intoxicated caller, Howie, joins, adding to the chaotic exchange and revealing personal details about Lady Di.  The segment ends with a shouting match and Lady Di being banned from calling.

The hosts then boast about their XM Satellite Radio success, mentioning subscriber growth and an upcoming Vegas appearance.  They discuss future segments and critique their misogynistic and homophobic radio promos, mentioning producer Steve's involvement.  This is followed by promotional material, including a "Total Recalling" segment, Better Sex Kits ads, and XM Satellite Radio promotions.  ACC Today sports updates are played, interspersed with more XM ads.  Listeners call in with mixed reactions to the Lady Di segment, with one suggesting the hosts are documenting her downward spiral.  The hosts discuss a perceived slight from Howard Stern and their relationship with their agent, Bob Eaton, describing him as boring but effective.

The show continues with a discussion about the recent tsunami, seguing into sarcastic commentary about their charitable contributions (or lack thereof) and crude, morbid jokes. They discuss upcoming appearances at the MGM Grand and a WWE event, highlighting their independent promotional efforts due to perceived inadequate support from XM Satellite Radio.  They express frustration with XM and plan a meeting with executives, anticipating Jimmy Norton’s aggressive participation.  Bernie Getz, the guest DJ, arrives late, prompting jokes about his habits and appearance, and his collection of uncased CDs is ridiculed.  The conversation returns to the tsunami coverage, criticizing the news networks and launching into a profane tirade against an expensive Central Park art installation, culminating in a comedic, expletive-laden patriotic rant.  A brief mention of a missing potato precedes a commercial break.

After the break, they discuss a "Wow Sticker Stop" event and a Hooked on Phonics commercial.  A caller shares a story about Howard Stern's reaction to their show, followed by another caller’s account of a supposedly fatal incident involving the Central Park art installation’s creator.  Further discussion of Bernie Getz's impending DJ set and speculation about his habits follows, concluding with a caller noting the coincidence of Bernie's first song choice, "Sweet Jane," and its relevance in *Natural Born Killers*.

The next segment features Bernie Getz as guest DJ. The hosts express disdain for the "John and Jeff Show," and mention a California incident involving a deadly umbrella installation by an artist who also caused a death in Japan.  Goetz, introduced as a controversial figure, discusses his perspective on the subway shooting incident 20 years prior.  The interview is rambling and incoherent, interspersed with his DJ set which includes songs by Lou Reed, Pat Benatar, and Seal.  Goetz's comments touch upon race, drugs, his philosophy on life and violence, societal issues, and his decision to bury the gun used in the shooting in Vermont.  The segment includes numerous commercial breaks for XM Satellite Radio and is punctuated with offensive language.

Bernie Getz's DJ set continues, featuring seemingly random song choices selected hours beforehand. The conversation veers to Bernie's website (Bernie4mayor.com), drug legalization, and his belief that cats might be aliens.  A caller, Chuck, sings a racist children's rhyme. Other callers interact with Bernie, struggling to understand his website address. The discussion involves explicit sexual content, including a humorous exchange about getting Bernie a hooker.  They discuss *Rocky Horror Picture Show*, Tim Curry's attractiveness, and Bernie's lost pet squirrel, which he claims could say "stop."  This includes audio clips from a news report satirizing the search for the squirrel.  The segment includes commercial breaks and mentions Howard Stern, a perceived rivalry, and a song parody contest Bernie participated in on Stern's show.

The final segment focuses on Fox's "Who's Your Daddy?"  The hosts and a caller, Chris from Jersey, critique the show's premise and the attractiveness of contestant TJ,  discussing its potentially exploitative and incestuous nature. They play audio clips from the show, highlighting the contestants' introductions, interactions, and the emotional reunion at the end. The conversation becomes increasingly vulgar and sexually suggestive, with frequent use of crude language.  The hosts express disbelief and amusement at the show’s premise and participants’ behavior.  The segment abruptly ends due to time constraints, briefly touching on Opie's indifference to being replaced on a radio show and an anecdote about a drunk driving stop involving a frustrated choreographer, interspersed with XM radio advertisements.

[00:05:30]  Thank you. 
[00:06:00]  Thank you. 
[00:06:30]  Thank you. 
[00:07:00]  Uh-huh.  Picture the exact opposite of that.  Wow, that's really nice.  That's just too good to be true for most people.  Do you realize who you hired?  Beautiful girls.  What kind of sick mind operates like that?  I hate this place.  I hate this place. 
[00:07:30]  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  Nothing works here.  I hate this place.  I hate this place.  I hate this place.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medication's on work.  I hate this place.  I hate this place.  Well, let me tell you something, my croc-bick friend. 
[00:08:00]  He was banging cocktail waitresses.  Do it at night.  God damn it.  Are you fucking with me?  Don't stop breathing.  I hate this place.  Don't need to start off.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  So bad! You're so stupid!  Why don't you stop playing with yourself, will you? 
[00:08:30]  Don't kill my ass! Don't kill!  That's terrific! That's terrific!  What is your problem, you insensitive asshole? 
[00:09:00]  The ONA virus spreading across America, thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  And we greatly appreciate the support everyone's given, the radio program around America. 
[00:09:30]  Yes, more people on board on a daily basis.  It's actually starting to get pretty crazy with the amount of people that are signing up for this channel.  Is it crazy, nuts, or insane?  It's crazy, and it's getting close to insane.  Close to insane, and we've passed nuts?  We are talking to like, whatever.  They're so secretive with the numbers, and they should start being really proud of the numbers that we've brought in to XM.  Be proud of your numbers. 
[00:10:00]  In the last month, I think we're talking to like 20% more people.  That figure is...  11?  Got 11 people now?  It's just insane.  Yes.  Morning, Jimmy.  Good morning, Ope.  Good morning, Ant.  Well, Jimmy Norton.  You happy with your coffee?  It's fine.  And have you slept?  No.  I was up all night the night before last, and yesterday I went home, and I slept from like 2 to 5.30 in the afternoon, which is why I look like Hedda Nussbaum on Super Bowl Sunday. 
[00:10:30]  Hedda Nussbaum.  A Hedda Nussbaum reference right off the bat.  Stupid bangs into my eyes.  I'm sure they put her on a makeover show.  They ought to put her on, really see what they could do.  It's all right if you take a girl with some potential and look at her and go, all right, they might be able to turn her into a babe on the swan or something.  But grab a Hedda Nussbaum.  Well, we have a Hedda Nussbaum.  We could do that.  We got Stalker Patty.  Oh.  Stalker Patty.  See what you can do with that lump of crap, that mess. 
[00:11:00]  I'm sure they'd be able to fix Hedda, but we don't know what to do with this rusty tricycle.  Well, there's someone on the line right away.  You know, but we're trying to make this show more gooder, so we need some kind of rule.  We'll give Lady Di two minutes to get our interest up, and if it doesn't happen, we just move on.  Once again, very early.  We're kind of wasting 20, 30 minutes on her, and then realizing when you listen to the replay that there was nothing there.  Absolutely nothing.  All right?  We'll put her on the clock and see what she has to say for two minutes. 
[00:11:30]  What do you think?  Yeah, let's hear.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Lady Di.  How you doing, guys?  I knew you were going to do that.  A little laughing.  That's a coconut cream pie, and it's very good.  Yes, it is. 
[00:12:00]  Yes, it is?  What does that mean?  I'm getting my hair cut again, and, you know...  What are you making fun of me for?  What?  You're making fun of me.  Oh, really?  Wow.  You catch on quick.  That's the only reason that we have you on the air at all.  Okay, good.  Di, when are you getting your hair cut?  Probably tomorrow.  After they cut your hair, I hope there's footage of it on Ogrish.com.  What, do you want me to send you a little lock on my hair, or what? 
[00:12:30]  Ugh, please.  Hi, Jim.  So, you have probably about a minute to interest us, or we hang up on you.  Okay, hold on one second.  The guy at the haircutter place just had to oil his scissors, so he invited her up.  You.  That nasty...  Hold on, Howie wants to talk to you.  Oh, good old Howie.  Howie's...  Hold on, hold on.  I'm here at Lady Di's house.  Who is this?  Hey, Howie.  It's Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton, and...  Hey, what's up, guys?  You guys been drinking all night? 
[00:13:00]  No.  No?  I'm going down to the shore.  You're going down to the shore for what?  Yeah, it's a great time to go down to the Jersey Shore.  I'm in trouble with the law.  January.  Oh, yeah.  Your son or something is in trouble with the law?  Yeah, he's 17, and he needs his dad.  You find out what he did yet?  No, my ex-wife won't tell me.  Oh, yeah?  I'll find out when I get there.  All right, so what's going on with Lady Di today?  Has she looked for a job?  Is she drinking?  What's the update?  She's looking for a job.  I've been there. 
[00:13:30]  I was with her, and she signed applications out.  She's not lying.  He sounds drunk.  You think?  Yeah.  Sir, you sound drunk, sir.  Why else would they be up at 6 in the morning?  No, I'm getting...  I'm hopping on a train.  I'm out of here.  But you had a couple last night, maybe, right?  Me?  Oh, yeah.  I went to the crossroads.  Oh, yeah?  And drank all night?  Yeah, I got into a fight.  Yeah.  And stuff.  That damn jersey.  My ex-girlfriend was there, and she was just painting my ass.  Big scene.  Your jersey?  I always thought they were...  I don't know why I think they're Long Island every time they call in. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, it's interchangeable.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's pretty interchangeable.  Yeah, you know how women are.  Oh, yeah.  You're a pain in your ass.  Oh, of course.  You know that.  Words of wisdom, Howie.  Words of wisdom.  My wisdom?  Oh, please.  All right, listen.  Sound like her now.  He's rubbing off on him.  Let's get Lady Di back in the air.  She's got...  All right, brothers.  All right.  Thank you.  Good luck with you and your son down there.  Your son is a very willful boy.  I'm getting him in the Coast Guard.  Oh. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, that's great.  He lost his job.  He stayed back.  Perhaps he needs a bit of a talking to.  You know what I mean?  Perhaps a bit more.  So I've got to be like the father type of guy.  If I may be so bold, sir.  All right.  Well, why don't you sober up and take care of your son?  I'm sober.  All right.  Get Lady Di on the phone.  What do you suppose it is?  I'm hopping on a train, brother.  Oh, yeah?  Could you look around the room and hand the phone to a disgusting fat woman?  Anyone will do.  Oh, I'll find that real quick. 
[00:15:00]  I know you will.  All right, brother.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Here you go.  All right.  Bye, Howie.  Stop.  She's whispering.  All right.  Everybody.  Everybody.  Just get into it.  Get stupid.  Get retarded.  Get retarded.  Get retarded.  Let's get retarded.  Ha.  Let's get retarded in here.  Let's get retarded.  Ha.  Let's get retarded in here.  I want the whole version of that.  I know.  We can just play that all. 
[00:15:30]  That's a great tune.  Hey.  Hey.  Yes.  What?  We heard you whispering to Howie about it's going to be replayed.  What does that mean?  Four times it's going to be replayed today.  Never mind about that.  Do you want the old version?  Oh, my God.  Lady Di, why the fuck are you calling our radio program?  Because I want to talk to you guys.  About what?  All right.  About what?  You're being heard all over America.  What do you have to say?  All right.  I want to give you the old version of the retarded version.  What do you have to say?  What do you have to say?  Why are you calling our radio program? 
[00:16:00]  Because I want to say hi to you guys.  This isn't a casual fucking phone.  We're doing a national broadcast here.  And you have nothing to say.  Oh, listen to that laugh.  That nervous titter.  All right.  You know what we're going to do?  What are we going to do?  We're going to be up there on the 17th.  So just show up.  We don't give a crap what day you're going to be here.  All right.  We're going to be up there.  She's booking in advance.  So you decided to call the Opie and Anthony program.  What do you have for the show? 
[00:16:30]  I just wanted to say hi.  You know how valuable the air time is and we're wasting it with you again?  Tens of cents.  I forgot to wish you a happy new year.  What?  I forgot to wish you a happy new year.  The only reason we go to the phone is because we know you're going to die soon.  And we want to have a little...  No, no, no.  Not anytime soon.  Not anytime soon.  You want to know what?  You want to know what?  What?  You want to know what?  What?  Shut up.  Lady Di, you know what?  Your 15 minutes of fame has ended. 
[00:17:00]  It's really time to realize...  We're into the 20th minute.  It's really time to realize that.  Okay.  We've tried to milk you like the cow you are, but...  Yeah, there's nothing left in you except powdered milk.  There's nothing.  You have mad cow disease.  It's time to put you down.  I don't have any mad cow disease.  I'm going to shoot that bolt through your head.  Will you stop with that already?  Shoot that bolt right through your head once you drop.  We're milking our teats and just dust is coming out at this point.  Oh, there's nothing left.  There's nothing. 
[00:17:30]  You feel the milk bags and there's nothing there but tumors.  Even an Ethiopian child isn't going to find milk in your boobs.  Nothing.  You have nothing to...  You have nothing to add to this program.  Tsunami victims would turn you away in your rancid, tough meat.  Will you stop already?  There's a fire in the barn.  You just stand there.  You're too stupid to run until your stomach explodes.  So your hide is burning.  I hope people realize the beauty that is Lady Di.  She's like, I'm not a tsunami victim.  Stop already.  They're hearing all of the nonsense that comes out of her maw.  That is not even funny. 
[00:18:00]  What's not?  It's really funny.  What's not funny?  What's not funny and why?  Being a tsunami victim.  That is not even funny.  It's hilarious.  I think it's...  No, it's not, Jim.  It is.  It's better than being a dead...  Yeah, it's better than being a dead tsunami victim.  Right.  They'd look like you, all bloated.  Boy, oh boy.  You guys are something else.  Yeah, we're something else.  How about you get a job, Di?  What?  How about you get a job?  I've been looking for a job for...  How long...  I don't know how long...  How long are you looking? 
[00:18:30]  Does anybody want...  Does anybody want...  Why the fuck is she on our show?  Well, I don't know.  Dude, we could just play the last time you were on the show.  This is the same crap.  If you want to know what Lady Di's about, listen when we're on vacation.  There'll be a best-of segment that sounds exactly like this.  You add nothing to this program.  Oh, come on, guys.  Where the...  Fuck, guys.  Where were you looking for work?  All over the place.  You could even ask Callie about this.  That's exactly what she said last time.  All over the place.  Have you been drinking tonight?  Huh? 
[00:19:00]  Have you been drinking tonight?  No, I have not.  All right, that's what you said last time.  And she's a liar.  How did you get the...  Why didn't you call me a liar?  How did you get the bruised jaw and black eye?  What bruised jaw and black eye?  I don't have a black eye.  I don't even have a bruised jaw right now.  How did you get the bruised jaw?  How did...  I told you on the treadmill.  All right, we heard that a million times.  So what else...  What do you have to add that's brand new to the program today?  Um, why?  Do you want me to break my leg or something like that, or what?  I don't know what you want me to do.  What do you have to add to the program today? 
[00:19:30]  Nothing.  I just want to say hello.  Why?  Everything is okay, and I'm still looking for a job.  Stop calling our program.  Stop calling to say hello.  I don't really care about you and your stupid life.  Ah, see?  Ah, you see, now we're off to a bad start.  I barely get phone calls from my own family, and I care about them.  Why are you calling us to say hi?  You ever get a call from a family member open, your phone's ringing, and you just get stepped 
[00:20:00]  on by a fat pig as you're trying to talk?  What?  You ever talking, um...  Your phone rings, and it's a family member, and it pops up on your caller ID, and you don't  accept it?  She's still talking.  Sometimes.  We're not talking to you, you fat cow!  Oh, my God.  I knew this was going to happen.  And you don't answer it, because, you know, maybe you just don't feel like talking on the 
[00:20:30]  phone.  Mm-hmm.  Why would we want to talk to her when I turn down sometimes close family members and friends?  I really don't know.  I screen my calls and go, no, I don't feel...  Oh, because you never turn down close friends.  You've got to be kidding.  You don't do that.  I, I, I'm, I'm picturing my fist, like, punching her in her teeth so hard that some of them  fly out.  I wouldn't punch a woman, but I understand, after talking to her.  You're never going to do that, Aunt.  Lady Di...  Or OB, or anybody. 
[00:21:00]  Lady Di, go away.  Until you have something for this program, just go away.  She's banned.  Okay.  You're banned from the program.  I'm banned now.  Yes.  Until you bring something to the program that's new.  Yeah, you have absolutely nothing new to add to this program.  Nothing.  And we just wasted 20 minutes.  Nothing.  All right.  And, and, you know, you could start emailing Ben or calling Ben with your suggestions how  you want to be back on this program.  But until then, we can't keep going to the phone for the Lady Di update because you have 
[00:21:30]  nothing to add.  What?  Do you want me to draw another mustache back on or what?  That would be something.  That's a start.  And that would be funny for two minutes.  And that's great for radio.  Yeah, that's awesome for radio.  You are a disgusting fat body, Project File.  Lady Di, go away.  No.  If you.  It's over, Jenny. 
[00:22:00]  Waddles away.  That slob.  I'm waddling away.  If you think you have something to add to this program, just email all your ideas to  steve at foundrymusic.com.  I'm good friends.  We don't know.  No, no, no.  Look, look.  I'm good friends with you guys.  I just want to remain friends.  We're not your friends.  Oh, right.  You're not my friends.  I literally have two, maybe three friends in this entire world.  And guess what?  You're not one of them.  Wait a minute.  Two or three. 
[00:22:30]  That excludes one of us.  Exactly.  Figure it out during the commercials.  Lady Di, we're not your friends.  Do you understand what we do for a living?  We exploit people.  We're not making believe here at all.  We're not your friends.  I never said anything.  We're not your friends.  I never said anything.  I still like you guys.  I don't care if you like us.  We don't like you.  You're not the type of person I would hang out with.  I wouldn't hang out with a drunken, fat slob of a woman. 
[00:23:00]  That can't take care of her own son, who's an alcoholic, who can't figure out how to  pay her bills, who lives in a flop house.  And guess what?  I don't care.  I don't care.  Your son could die in a house fire.  I wouldn't even care.  Do you understand?  Do you understand me?  I don't care about anything to do with you. 
[00:23:30]  Well, you don't have to.  I don't care if you like me.  I don't give a fuck if you like me.  Wait, hold on one second.  Marion and I will support you three guys until the very end, whenever that is.  Well, the end for you is coming soon.  I'll bet anyone that you don't make it to the end of 2005.  And you know what?  When we get the news that you dropped dead of alcoholism, guess what? 
[00:24:00]  I won't even shed a tear.  I'll be like, oh, well.  I might put a little retrospective of how stupid you were on our program, you know, maybe with  some wacky music, but that's about all you'll get.  Okay.  That's okay with me.  Fine.  I'm just telling you right now.  We're going to support you guys until the very end.  Doesn't bother me at all.  Doesn't bother me at all.  Where did we hear that yesterday?  The lady died.  Doesn't bother me at all.  The lady died.  What?  And what I say to that is, I don't care.  Well, let me tell you something right now. 
[00:24:30]  We will always let you know.  I don't care.  Stop repeating yourself 20,000 times.  Well, Opie keeps on repeating himself 20,000 times.  Opie keeps on repeating.  Shut up.  Hold on a minute.  God, what a mess.  Uh, hold on.  I gotta do this.  All right.  I'm right here.  Marion.  Hi.  How are you doing?  Hi, Anthony.  Hi, Tim.  How are you doing?  Hello, Marion.  The other half of the Retard Liberation.  Very responsible, Marion.  Diane, what are you doing at 6 o'clock in the fucking morning? 
[00:25:00]  Listen, I'm up right now, and I figured I'd give myself up.  You're up drinking because you're getting pissed off at me.  No, no, no.  I'm completely sober.  Yeah, you are.  We went to the Crossroads last night with Howie.  I did not go to the Crossroads last night with Howie.  You know what?  Every time I ask you, let's go see Opie and Anthony, you never have $8 for the fucking train,  but you have money to go out drinking every couple nights.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  That's the way I did for you for Christmas?  And I asked you, I said, let's go see Opie and Anthony before Christmas and New Year's.  Oh, I don't have $8 for the train.  But, yeah, I went out and I spent money on you. 
[00:25:30]  I helped you pay whatever I did to help you out.  No, no, no, listen to me.  You always say no, no, no, but you're half in a bag every other day I call you.  And you're calling him up.  I wasn't in a bag last night.  I didn't want to talk to you.  What are you doing, Diane?  You sound like you're drunk on the radio.  I'm not drunk on the radio right now.  You sound it to me.  I am not.  What are you frigging?  I am not.  You could even ask Howie about this.  And they're yelling at you.  And they're yelling at you because you don't know what to talk about.  Well, I called them up to say hi. 
[00:26:00]  Doesn't she sound drunk?  Why don't you just ask?  Forget about what they say.  No, I'm talking to you right now.  No, I'm not.  Diane, you are too.  I woke up and I just called them up.  You call the phone.  I keep telling you, go here for a job.  All right, you did the other day look for a job.  That I know.  So what are you so worried about with that?  Marion.  Diane.  No, wait, wait.  Hold on one second.  Why do you have to get up at 6 o'clock in the morning to go up there on the set?  I want these two to fight so bad.  I've been working on this for years.  Wrecking that friendship.  I've been working on wrecking their friendship for years. 
[00:26:30]  The goal has been to destroy a lifelong friendship.  I think we're getting closer.  We're almost there.  Listen to this hatred.  You know, let me tell you one thing.  If it wasn't for Howie, Howie does a lot to you.  Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  That's right.  If it wasn't for me, that wouldn't be radio robbing.  You know, I'm going to hear this four times today, later on today.  This guy is a great guy.  No, no, no, no, listen to me.  He was not drunk.  He calls me up and he says, I can't take it anymore.  What do you mean he can't take it anymore?  Take it anymore.  You're driving a guy crazy, okay? 
[00:27:00]  All right, Marion.  Marion, I want to talk to you for a second.  Don't listen to her psychobabble.  Listen to me, okay?  It's time for you to give up on Lady Di, just like Lady Di's father did.  No, I'm not.  She's not going to give up on me.  No.  It's really time to give up on your friend.  Hey, Anthony, this guy, Howie.  She's pulling you down.  I mean, there's still hope for you with the Opie and Anthony program, but we can't be bothered  with Lady Di anymore.  But what got me mad is because I wanted to go up and visit you guys so bad.  I had four days off for work right before the holidays. 
[00:27:30]  I can't go.  I don't know.  I'll think about it.  I'll think about it.  But yet, she can't save $8 for a frigging train when she gets money?  Marion.  Have the money.  Marion.  What?  You come up by yourself.  You're the star of the team anyway.  There you go.  No one wants to hear Lady Di.  She's just wallpaper.  All right.  Everybody stop.  Lady Di.  Everybody stop.  No.  I'm not.  She'll be calling up the show crying.  Marion.  Lady Di is your Robin.  She'll be calling up the show crying.  Forget about that.  Marion.  I know.  Marion.  Lady Di is your Robin.  She really doesn't do much of anything. 
[00:28:00]  Trust me.  What do you mean I don't do much of anything?  You're the true talent of the duo, and start facing reality.  It's time for you to just show up by yourself.  I am going to come up on the 17th, because that's my next day off work.  Good.  I have the money to do that.  You know work, don't you, Lady Di?  You remember that stuff.  What does it make any difference?  I still get money.  It's the place you used to drink at.  What place did you drink at?  Oh, let's not bring that up.  Oh, let's not bring up when she worked at the Budweiser factory, and Bud's stock went 
[00:28:30]  down because she was drinking the profits.  Anthony, stop.  Yes, stop.  I've got news for you, though.  I'll go down at Budweiser.  All right, listen.  What happened at Budweiser?  People ain't drinking Budweiser.  I was laid off from there.  Why are we laid off?  Because she was laid out on the floor drunk.  Because they're cutting back on stuff.  Hey, OBS.  Cutting back on fat people.  Can you hang up on Diane or me?  They needed one less Clydesdale to pull that wagon.  I want to wish you a safe trip in Las Vegas. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, me too.  Thank you, Marion.  How are you going to be on?  Thanks, Marion.  Marion, you know, if you do die, there will be a slight tear in my eye, I've got to admit.  Why?  If you do?  If you do.  But if Lady Di...  Thanks.  When Lady Di does die, I could care less.  Trust me.  No, guys, when are yous going?  Yous going today?  Yous going tomorrow?  Marion.  Tomorrow.  Now, Marion.  Shut up, Diane.  I'm asking about Vegas because I listen to the show.  I am not drunk right now.  Yes, you are.  Oh, yes, you are. 
[00:29:30]  You're a compulsive liar.  You're a compulsive liar.  I'm a compulsive liar?  I am at home?  I'm a compulsive liar?  You're a drunken echo.  You don't sound like you're drinking.  Seriously, you don't sound like you're drinking.  We ought to get every clip of her with that ridiculous repeating lilt thing she does and just get all of that and string them together.  So, you know, I've been drinking.  I called the show.  I don't have a job.  I went to bed early last night.  That's why. 
[00:30:00]  Duh.  Every time you talk, you sound like a Meisner exercise.  I'm a fatso.  I'm a fatso.  Did you go out with Howie?  Stupid ass.  Well, no, I did not.  I fell asleep and he went out.  Lady Di, you're just a waste of space at this point.  You're a waste of a lot of space.  You really are.  Waste of a space that you could put a sofa in.  You're a waste of an acre.  You guys got to meet, though, Diane's roommate.  He's such a cool guy and he's so sweet.  And what about me?  What's wrong with me?  You're nuts.  Let's start with your head, you're nuts. 
[00:30:30]  I'm going to kill you, Mom.  Let's start with your big head.  I'm not even going to say it.  Well, say it.  Have some courage.  Yeah, have some courage for once in your stupid life.  Why don't we get off the phone?  I have to argue with you.  Ooh.  You're nuts.  No, Marion, don't call her.  You're nuts.  Don't call her.  I am not.  What do you mean, don't call me?  Ooh.  Don't call me every day.  Don't call me.  Don't call me, you're nuts.  Ooh.  All right, Marion, we got to let you go, okay?  Cut it out.  Hey, how much you love me?  Marion, great appearance.  Thank you.  Good appearance, Marion.  Marion, you saved this bit.  Thank you so much. 
[00:31:00]  Guys, I'll call you when you come back.  When are you guys going to fight on our show?  You want us to?  I would have fist fight with Diane.  I would have fist fight with Diane.  I would not fist fight with Diane because I know I would hurt her and I wouldn't do that.  Hey.  What?  I'm tougher than you.  Who lifts the weights?  I do.  Just don't punch her in the liver.  Your hand will shatter.  No, Diane, I do.  Who walks the park in the car?  Shut up already and make up and be good.  Ooh.  All right, love, thanks.  Oh, my God. 
[00:31:30]  Thanks, ladies.  Hey, I'm going to be listening to you while you're there in Vegas.  Marion.  Why?  It's a retard song again.  Marion, it's always a pleasure when you call this program.  What about me?  I try to call when I can.  Yeah, thank God you called and saved this segment.  I really appreciate it, okay?  I love you guys.  All right, Marion.  Marion, everybody.  Marion, everybody.  Let's get into it.  Get stupid.  I'm on.  Get retarded.  I'm on.  Get retarded.  Everybody.  Get retarded.  Let's get retarded in here.  Let's get retarded. 
[00:32:00]  Let's get retarded in here.  Let's get retarded.  Ha.  Let's get retarded.  Lady Di, F off.  Hey.  Bye-bye.  All right.  F off.  We're going to start the O.P.  Anthony program in a couple minutes here, Anthony.  F off?  F off.  F off?  Repeat.  Repeat back.  Repeat back.  What?  Repeat?  Is Bernie Getz really coming in today?  Is Bernie Getz coming in today?  Shut up.  That's what you do.  That's a Meisner exercise. 
[00:32:30]  Your shirt is yellow.  My shirt is yellow.  Your shirt is yellow.  My shirt is yellow.  It's awful.  That sounds horrible.  That's what it is.  It's the only exercise she ever does.  The best was, I'm not a tsunami victim.  Tsunami victim.  Tsunami.  I'm not a tsunami victim.  Of course you're not.  You're calling from Phuket.  All right.  All right.  Well, is Bernie Getz really going to be a guest DJ today?  Yes.  We decided to bring Bernie Getz back because, you know, he's just, he just fascinates us. 
[00:33:00]  You know, people don't realize the talent there, perhaps.  Perhaps they don't see that maybe there's another direction he can go.  Oh, and maybe radio is it.  Anyway, is he going to spin some tunes?  Yeah, I talked to him yesterday.  He's very upset about the state of radio these days.  Well, who is it?  Well, that's true.  Who, who, who?  Yeah.  So.  They're ripping me off.  Robin.  Should be funny.  So he, he's got a playlist that he's bringing in? 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, he's still working on it now.  Is Bernie Getz a good radio name?  Yeah.  Because he could use it in everything.  Bernie gets busy.  Oh, that's kind of good.  All right.  It's like, what was the movie, Leo Getz, that Joe Pesci was at Lethal Weapon?  That was Lethal Weapon 2.  Yeah.  And 3.  All right.  Well, he's going to spin some tunes and talk between the records and things like that,  right?  And Steve made sweepers and everything, so.  Yeah, it should be fun.  How did Steve put woman abuse in a Bernie Getz sweeper?  I can't wait to hear it. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, enough with the, you know, I was listening to the replays during our little break.  Enough with the promos.  They're awful.  They're all about just hurting women and making Ant and I look gay and it's just.  Well, that's what it's been since we got here.  I thought it changed.  I thought, like, he was, you know, growing and developing.  It's the same shit.  It's all about beating up women.  It's one promo that makes you and I sound like the gayest blades.  Really?  It's awful. 
[00:34:30]  Enough with the gay promos.  I haven't made any gay promos.  There you go.  I haven't made any of the new sweepers with the gay, uh, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Because I had to change that to get Marion on the phone.  Damn it.  I almost had it.  All right.  No, none of the new ones are misogynistic in any way, shape or form.  Really?  No.  They're not, actually.  I've been doing stuff like mixing hip-hop and country beats and stuff like that and getting 
[00:35:00]  creative.  You know what?  Why don't you give us your latest production?  I want to hear it, actually.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, I mean, just, well, not this second, but maybe later in the show.  Yeah, absolutely.  Because I think you're clever enough to, like, move past the women abuse promo.  Yeah, I haven't done, I haven't really done anything misogynistic in a while.  And the aunt and I are gay promos.  Oh, there was one.  There was one that you haven't heard yet.  I played it for you one time and you were like, yeah, hold off on that one.  Exactly.  But, uh, it was...  Is it a bit fruity?  Oh, it was, uh...  Is Ramon in it? 
[00:35:30]  No, Ramon is not in it.  Ramon, clean this up.  What does that mean?  That was my, uh...  That was my, uh...  I did those, uh, per, uh, Lee Abrams instructions.  You know, do the unconventional, uh...  Dude, Lee Abrams doesn't even know where he is.  Why are you taking advice from Lee Abrams?  Oh, that was one of the first ones I did, just because...  The guy has smoked a lot of pot and you'll understand what Lee Abrams is.  The guy's a legend in his business, but that guy has no clue what planet he's on.  Oh, that's why I haven't made too many of those.  I hear the guy flies all over the country and he has what? 
[00:36:00]  That sleeping disease, that nar...  The...  Narcolepsy.  Narcolepsy.  Really?  That's what I hear.  I've heard from the gang down at, uh, you know, down there in Washington that Lee Abrams  flies his plane and sometimes falls asleep while he's flying.  And then he wants to take you for a ride.  Those things fly themselves.  It's like Jack Wharton in Unjustice for All.  Um, helicopter?  Yeah.  Sorry.  No.  Well, listen, why don't we take a quick break?  Yes, he is.  Do we still have to do that two-break-an-hour crap?  Yes.  Yeah.  We do, huh? 
[00:36:30]  We got a request for total recalling.  We have 20 minutes of commercials now.  Yeah, somebody's emailing Ben, very upset, saying that, you know, I don't want to sit  through 20 minutes of...  You guys, I...  What did he time it out or something?  I don't know where he gets 20 minutes.  I don't know where he got 20 minutes either, because it's nowhere near 20 minutes.  No, not at all.  It's just, you know...  Relax.  The guy...  We talked for, like, almost an hour straight yesterday and had to play two breaks almost  in a row.  We came back and talked a little between them, and the guy must have thought that was one 
[00:37:00]  big, long break.  Stop it.  So that's the beauty of the MiFi and the beauty of the replays, though.  You know?  Yeah.  You could just fast-forward through all that crap now.  Wow.  Where's this crazy fight?  Oh, yeah.  I saw this.  This is kind of an old one.  Some school in New York City, some big, fat, black woman beating up a...  skinny, black girl hitting her head against a car and just talking smack.  You see her head going back and forth, and she's just like, my man.  Oh, we got to talk about the tsunami when we get back. 
[00:37:30]  This is exactly what we're talking about.  Oh.  We have another reason why the rest of the world hates us.  Hates America.  Hates America, and we'll tell you about it next.  But first, it's Total Recalling.  I've been dreaming of going to Mars, where mutants drive plastic cars. 
[00:38:00]  So I go there, you know the rest.  The best part is the girl with three breasts.  Total Recalling.  So I'm on Mars, and I meet Quinto, and I pull this up. 
[00:38:30]  Big, metallic thing out of my nose.  It makes me scream and shout, and move my big robotic head all about. 
[00:39:00]  Total Recalling.  See you at the party, Victor.  Total Recalling.  Total Recalling.  Total Recalling.  Total Recalling.  Total Recalling.  Total Recalling.  One more time, fellas.  Total Recalling.  I'm going to start ballin'. 
[00:39:30]  I'm so sad. I can't screw Sharon Stone. And Macaulay Culkin has left home all alone.  Ah! Total Rick! Total Rick Collin! Johnny, give me the bass. You've got to slap it a little harder. Give me the bass. 
[00:40:00]  Alright. Okay. End of business. I don't think it's in room because I don't know the fingering. It's not working. Johnny, grab my hand! Grab the bass!  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony.  Ooh, it's in my shoes. Ramon, clean this up.

[00:41:30]  He shoots. ACC Basketball. It's the ACC Today. Tie your shoes nice and tight because ACC Basketball is breaking you down. You better box your man out because we're grabbing the boards. Round ball, baby. It's the ACC Today on XM Satellite Radio.  Cut off the ricochet. It's Tuesday, the 4th of January, 2005. I'm Ari Bykovsky with the ACC Today. Some of the ACC's top teams open their conference play. Let's begin with the Wake Forest Demon Deacons who took on Virginia this game in Charlottesville. 
[00:42:00]  Gray, Paul, the three got open good. That was too easy. Chris Paul, the open three and it's 24-19 now and the Deacons have their biggest lead. It is a 10-2 run by Wake Forest at 8-58.  Virginia Radio Network and Cavalier Sports Marketing on the call. Wake makes big statements early on. Takes care of Virginia.  89-70 led by Chris Paul's 21 points and 9 assists. Undefeated Duke took on Clemson. 
[00:42:30]  Mel Keone with a quick inbounds comes up to Ewing. Over to J.J. Stops. Pops. Scores!  J.J. Redick with his 27th 20-point outing of his career as he knocks on his 22nd point to give Duke a 10-point lead at 53-43.  Duke Radio Network on the call. Duke gets by Clemson 65-54.  And now for Clemson head coach Oliver Purnell. He talks about the game.  I like the direction we're going in. You know, obviously I'd like him a lot better if we'd have won that one tonight. 
[00:43:00]  If we will improve from here, you know, this time next Saturday night I'll like him a lot.  But, you know, how we respond to this, that disappointment is there now.  Then we can turn that disappointment into resolve and a determination and grit, more grit than great.  And so, and that's what we intend to do.  And that's the ACC Today on XM Satellite Radio.

[00:45:00]  He said, too bad Dai wasn't looking for a job in Thailand last week.  It's a little harsh.  That's good.  Mark in Tennessee, what's up, buddy?  Hey, man, what's going on, guys?  What's happening?  Hi, Mark.  What's up, Dermaine?  What do you got for the program?  Why y'all keep letting Lady Dai call, dude, because that shit's just really dead.  I don't know why.  I honestly don't know why.  You know why?  I'll let you know why, because she was a character on the show for quite a while, for 
[00:45:30]  quite a few years before we even came here, before we got the boot, unfortunately, before  a lot of people got to listen to the show.  And the downfall of this slob is just amazing.  How she has fallen.  And we're just kind of documenting it.  And I don't know if it plays a little better for the people that are a little more familiar  with what she was years ago.  Maybe it does.  I don't know.  I kind of like the tragedy.  I kind of like keeping tabs on people that are doing worse off than we are. 
[00:46:00]  Kind of makes you feel a little better about yourself.  And Marion saved it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She saved that thing.  Let's go to Justin.  Marion saved it?  Justin.  Hey, how are you?  Pretty good.  What's going on today?  Oh, my God.  I'm glad I found you guys.  Had it not been for the crow whining yesterday, I wouldn't have known where to get you.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I got XM for Christmas, and I just installed it like a week ago, and I'm still getting  familiar. 
[00:46:30]  I didn't even know you guys were available until yesterday, and I'm glad that I learned  it, because I'm in D.C., and you guys were here shortly, and then you were gone.  That's why we said yesterday that Howard played right into our hands, man.  No, and I guess you guys do a repeat in the afternoon, so I was hearing the whole conversation.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, well, he gave us like a 20-minute commercial, and you know what?  I want to thank Howard today.  Thank you very much.  Oh, yeah, and he's been very annoying, and I'm not one of those, you know.  You know, he can't get under our skin at all, and it bothers him, you know, and he did 
[00:47:00]  20 minutes on pretty much telling everyone where we're now being heard.  I heard the clip, because someone sent it to Ben, I guess, and it was Howard and Artie  were going off on Fareed, and Artie was doing a Fareed impression.  It was the first time I had laughed at a Howard Stern show, and I don't know how long.  It was genuinely funny.  I got to give it to him.  I'm not going to lie and say, oh, it was stupid and screw it.  I was listening and laughing.  It was very funny. 
[00:47:30]  They were doing a whole thing on Fareed programming the station and putting in other people in  one of our places.  So it was like, you know, Anthony and Imus and Anthony and Opie Mancow.  They just kept going back and forth with it, and it was really funny.  Artie's a very funny guy.  Very funny.  And he was real nice when I met him.  He's a soldier, you know.  He's not going to sit down.  He's now trashing us, whatever, but it's phony crap. 
[00:48:00]  He didn't trash you.  I've heard he did.  I don't know.  No, we heard it yesterday.  Yeah, it was just funny.  But he gave us a 20-minute commercial and telling more people where we can be heard.  So thank you.  They never got on the air and said, oh, O&A, those guys suck.  Never did that.  Well, they're going to lose that battle.  I know.  They try to do that crap.  It was just getting on.  At this point, I think people know we don't suck.  All right?  Yeah.  Been around a while.  Been around a while.  Had some success in this business.  A little bit.  A little bit. 
[00:48:30]  That was funny.  Uh-oh.  Citadel what?  AJ in Harrisburg.  AJ, what's up?  Yeah, man.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah.  Listening to the, what is it, 10570X here in Harrisburg.  Howard, they got a local dude on there.  No Howard at all.  Yesterday, I wasn't in the area to hear it, but I guess you read some kind of statement  about what's going on.  But it's like they got their afternoon guy.  And check this out.  They got a black guy named Earl.  He's like a sidekick or something. 
[00:49:00]  A black Earl?  Did Earl move to Harrisburg on us?  Earl would never leave.  All right.  So, no, I don't know if we're going to be on in Harrisburg.  I really don't know.  I don't even know how much longer we're going to be on in Syracuse.  I don't know.  How do you do that?  We made a deal with Fareed to do like two weeks in Syracuse.  And that two weeks is up.  So, now, I don't know.  They're just running our show.  And that's fine.  Wait until Super Agent Bob Eaton gets a hold of him.  Can't be running the show. 
[00:49:30]  He can't be running the show longer than we said.  He called yesterday.  Without the compensation, that must be blah, blah, blah.  Well, he's the money guy.  He called me yesterday.  He's like, do you know they're still running your program for free in Syracuse?  Like so?  I'm like, wow, is that bad, Bob, that we're getting free publicity in Syracuse?  It's only going to help us in the long run?  Yeah, let him.  I mean, I figure we'll make a deal with Fareed.  He's good for it if he wants to make this long term.  I'm not worried that they're running the show for a couple more days. 
[00:50:00]  That it's going to be like two years gone by and we'll be like,  Hey, you know, we never signed anything with Fareed.  Just kind of lifting the show.  Bob, though, you know, he's right there with the cash.  If he 10% or nothing is what, Opie?  Nothing.  And Bob knows this.  There was a message at 6, 10 a.m. yesterday on the machine.  Guys, there's been no money.  That's pretty much it.  Where's my money?  Bob, by the way, is coming by in Vegas.  Yeah, that's the most exciting place on the face of the earth. 
[00:50:30]  Las Vegas, Nevada.  We got to balance it out by getting a visit and having to go to dinner with our own super  agent, Bob Eatman.  Only our super agent could suck the fun out of Vegas.  This guy is the biggest boar.  Picture a tumbleweed with a tie.  He is the biggest boar.  You'll be in Vegas like everything is happening around you.  It's Vegas just going, guys, Vegas is so exciting, isn't it? 
[00:51:00]  Oh, boy.  Well, it'll be more exciting after this dinner's over with.  I can see Bob trying to get a receipt from the coat check girl.  Right.  For the buck to be left.  This guy is the king of receipts, man.  I once drove around California with him, and he was getting receipts at toll plazas for  75 cents.  Hey, it adds up.  That's what he was trying to tell me.  I'm like, really?  Of course he was.  Hey, Bob.  You don't have to drive for the next, like, 100 years for it to add up to anything. 
[00:51:30]  To anything.  Hey, Bob, is your brother coming to dinner?  Well, he'd come over in a minute.  He's right now behind the Mirage, biting someone on the neck.  What?  Where is he?  Oh, my God.  I'd like a steak and a salad for my friend and a cup of blood for this gentleman.  Bob now gets to listen to the program, thanks to XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:52:00]  Yes.  In Los Angeles.  So, Bob, if you're listening, we're not kidding.  You are a bore.  Oh, you need to take some kind of classes or something.  Well, he's a very good agent.  He makes the deals for us.  Oh, he's an unbelievable agent.  That's what he does.  He makes the deals.  I guess he's going to show up and he'll be at the convention.  He said he wants to take us out for dinner while we're there.  So, that's one night we can just write off. 
[00:52:30]  He's going to wreck the porn convention.  All of a sudden, all these people are just going to lose their erections simultaneously.  Somebody roll radiation through the expo.  What does that mean?  Just that his mood will walk in.  Yeah.  I thought you were talking because he's follically challenged.  No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, no.  I'm not talking about his skull.  No, just the fact that...  Well, radiation, I'm thinking.  Radiation, you know, kind of, you know...  You're right.  It does.  Makes things fall out.  And, you know, Bob is losing a little bit up top.  I thought you were taking a little cheap shot at our agent. 
[00:53:00]  Taking a little cheap shot at your agent?  I didn't really appreciate that.  Don't appreciate it.  Don't appreciate that.  Considering he's taking care of little Jimmy Norris.  No, I was actually saying that radiation destroys an erection.  What would kill an erection with a radiation?  So I was implying that Bob is to an erection what radiation would be to an erection.  I just hate that every minute.  So you're trying to say he has no hair and he can't get it up?  I don't know.  I never noticed his hair, to be honest with you.  I never got past hello before I just dozed off at the table.  I thought I was like Lee Abrams with my narcolepsy.  Well, we have two of your... 
[00:53:30]  I just want to...  I can't picture sitting there with Bob at dinner when we're in Vegas.  Like there's so many things to do.  So many tables to play at.  And I'll be sitting there eating dinner thinking, you know...  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Casino, come on.  I want to play.  I'm in Vegas.  Can't he have dinner with us out here?  The funny thing is that's exactly what's going on in his head as he sits down to dinner with us. 
[00:54:00]  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  He's thinking about all the money he's making.  Money.  Cha-ching.  Yeah, that's right.  He just pulls our arm and money comes out.  Bob always wins when he plays the O&A machine.  He's done right by us.  Of course.  We know that.  He's just...  Love the Bobster.  Not the most exciting person in my life.  Makes him sound more exciting.  Let's play his nickname in high school. 
[00:54:30]  Hey, the Bobster's here.  What does Bob do for fun as a hobby, Opie?  Isn't he a musician?  Yeah, he plays the...  Now you would think, what?  He plays the guitar, drums, some exciting instrument that maybe you would think,  wow, some guy that has this type of personality, I wouldn't expect to be a musician that plays that kind of...  What does he play?  The French horn.  The French horn.  Who takes up the French horn?  Do you realize it's more masculine to play the cock? 
[00:55:00]  He's very good at playing the French horn.  You've heard him play?  Yes, in a couple local orchestras in the...  Local orchestras?  You went to one of his recitals?  I went to one of his practices.  His gigs?  A practice?  He actually traveled the world in a few orchestras.  What does a French horn do besides like...  He's not like the trumpet guy, is he?  I don't know.  You know, where you're really riffing?  I really don't know. 
[00:55:30]  Does he riff?  No, not really.  He just kind of sits there.  You sure it's the French horn, not the pan flute?  He's an accomplished musician.  Well, I know that.  Master of the pan flute.  For fun, him and his brother do like...  What is it when two...  Semphir.  What is it when two guys are playing instruments?  Like a duet?  Like a...  Awful.  Recital.  There's a name for it in the orchestra.  A duet, isn't it?  No.  Dooling Moe's?  Docking?  His brother is...  His brother is a... 
[00:56:00]  You pull the tip of your French horn over my French horn.  His brother plays the...  He's a pianist.  Oh, he is?  Yes, and very good at that.  And then...  Really?  Is it one of those big harpsichords?  Big pipe organ?  And then Bob...  Like the phantom?  And then Bob plays the French horn, and they get a little musical number.  And that's what they do for fun.  Two ghouls in the garage, just playing a concert for a bunch of ladders and paint cans. 
[00:56:30]  Holy shit!  They try to get some neighborhood interest in the backyard.  We're gonna do a show!  That's what he does, though.  They go over to each other's houses, and they spend hours playing.  I did not know that.  Yeah.  He was just meant to be an agent.  Yeah.  He's such an agent.  Bet you he has a big mule, though.  Because he's quiet and unassuming.  He's probably packing like nine.  You think?  Yeah.  He has to be.  Picked up that hot wife, so... 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, she's very, very pretty.  She's actually...  She's a great person.  That'll be something.  Robin is a great person.  Something she's going for.  Maybe, uh...  Lady Di.  That's it, Jimmy.  Yes.  Why are you calling back?  How's everything?  I just wanted to let you guys know that I like you no matter what.  You can hang up on me all you want, and I would still love you guys.  And I don't care.  Don't you understand?  I don't care.  I know you don't care.  It doesn't make any difference.  Stop calling.  Lady Di, how many people are dead from the tsunami? 
[00:57:30]  About 155,000 people right now.  Oh, wow.  She showed me up.  She showed me up, actually.  What was that written on the back of a Budweiser bottle?  No.  It's a shame for every one of those people.  Yeah, why don't you say a little something about each one of them?  Yeah, why is it a shame?  Stupid.  It's a shame because they, you know, from what happened...  What happened?  Who would have ever known that this would happen to anybody?  Every scientist who's ever studied the ocean. 
[00:58:00]  Well, you know, let me tell you...  Who would have known?  I never knew that this was going to happen in our lifetime, okay?  You're not a scientist.  I'm not a scientist.  You didn't know this was going to happen within our lifetime?  No, I did not.  Don't you know this happens a lot, really?  Not to that magnitude, but...  No.  Do you understand we'll probably also see a nuclear explosion before our lifetime?  Time is over?  Well, I...  A big volcanic eruption that wipes out people?  An earthquake?  I think it's a shame. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, do you really?  Of course.  You're really going out on a limb there.  A lot of people think it's a shame.  Really?  A lot of people?  Really?  A lot of people...  How about the whole world, you twat?  Of course.  You think it's a shame.  Way to go out on a limb.  No, no, it is.  It really...  Come on.  When you make a statement, boy, you don't care what the consequences are.  I think the tsunami's a shame.  Whoa, back off.  I don't even know what a tsunami was until it happened.  We know that.  All right, what is a tsunami?  A tsunami is when the ocean gets sucked in and comes back out again. 
[00:59:00]  It's an earthquake in the ocean.  She's kind of close.  Oh, but...  That's what it is.  What's it caused by?  It's...  All right, now, you got me here, but it's caused by an earthquake in the ocean.  Right.  Now, why?  Don't make fun of this.  Why does an earthquake cause a tsunami?  Huh?  Why would an earthquake cause a tsunami?  It's in the ocean.  Yeah, I know it's in the ocean, but what would the earthquake do that would actually make a big wave? 
[00:59:30]  It sucks up the ocean, and then it brings it back in full force.  That's what it does.  No, she's thinking of the way the water recedes before it comes in and thinking that that's what...  Exactly.  Oh, shut up.  You're stupid.  Yeah.  Well, whatever.  You've been probably sitting in front of the Discovery Channel for two weeks.  I feel really, really sorry for what happened to everyone over there.  Shut up.  It's the same result of you doing a cannonball off of the coast.  Have you been donating stuff over there?  No.  Why not?  For what?  We donate you to feed a village.  Oh, my God. 
[01:00:00]  You slob.  What have you donated?  So far, I'm going to donate some stuff tomorrow, and I will.  You're going to send it over in an empty liquor bottle?  No, not an empty liquor bottle, Jenny.  No.  What stuff are you sending over tomorrow?  Food.  Canned stuff.  What kind of canned stuff?  You know, the stuff they've been saying don't send.  Canned, whatever.  Tomatoes, whatever.  I don't know.  Canned tomatoes?  Oh, yeah, that's what they want.  150,000 dead people, and you're shipping canned tomatoes from Jersey.  What else do you want me to do?  You're a saint.  I don't know.  What do you want me to do?  They said send money. 
[01:00:30]  They don't want food and stuff.  They want money.  Who am I going to send the money to?  The Red Cross, you idiot.  Tsunami.com.  Stupid.  Why don't you donate your body for a pig roast?  No.  Think how many people she could have saved with them crawling up on that bloated body of hers.  They're all looking at it like the end of Apocalypse Now.  They just want to drive a machete through her neck.  Come on.  Think about it.  That's not funny.  Well, put an apple in your mouth.  That is not funny.  You're going to have a little luau. 
[01:01:00]  A little lady died luau.  Think about it.  Not only do they get really full, they get drunk.  I'm doing like a tan right now, okay?  They're meeting you.  I'm doing whatever I could.  Which is nothing.  What do you mean, which is nothing?  Just sit back and enjoy the coverage on CNN and leave the heavy lifting to others.  Bye-bye.  I don't know what happened.  Getting some instant feedback.  Why can't Jane Gums skin lady die?  She's got to be at least a size 14. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  Wouldn't that be great, cutting those diamonds into her back?  You could clothe the whole village.  All right, listen.  We got to take...  Nasty skin.  Marianne and Frederica Bimmel.  I don't like these two breaks an hour.  It's messing up the rhythm of the show.  We got to take another break now.  Really is.  And is Bernie Getz here?  No, no, you don't.  Where's Bernie, Ben?  He's prepping.  Bernie Getz is going to be waiting for his playlist.  Like show prep.  He's working on his playlist.  Is he awake?  He's working on his playlist.  Have you talked to Bernie Getz this morning? 
[01:02:00]  I haven't talked to him this morning.  I've left a message.  He's in the emails.  He's still sleeping.  Uh-oh.  Do you know where he lives?  Eric can wake him up.  He lives on 14th Street.  Send four Negroes over to his apartment and wake him up.  Send Earl.  Why do you look British?  Huh?  What's that supposed to be?  What is that?  He looks like one of the bartenders in the Corova Milk Bar with that British hair.  Why do you look British?  He looks British to me.  He does look British.  That is really funny, but you kind of do, and I don't even know why.  What is looking British?  I don't understand what that means.  I don't know, but you look like the social studies teacher in To Serve With Love, and it's 
[01:02:30]  really bugging me.  He looks like a young Austin Powers.  Take it easy, Ben Boston.  All right, listen.  Oh.  Okay.  Okay.  Send stuff to Jim Norton at the MGM Grand.  Jim Norton, MGM Grand in Vegas.  You want to send a Hummer?  I'll be there to receive it.  I don't care.  Send him room service at four in the morning.  It won't do it unless you call from your room.  We have to break up, but Bernie Getz is going to be guest DJing today, and Steve from  Jersey writes on the instant feedback that Bernie gets the lead in instead of gets the 
[01:03:00]  lead out.  Oh, get the lead in, and then you break into a Zeppelin block.  Very good.  Very good.  Very nice.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Why don't we step aside here?  Well, you know, I've heard a lot of radio over the years.  This is probably the worst.  Back, way back in the middle 60s, there was a small station outside of Moline, Illinois.  I believe it was WRCW, not sure of the call letters, 1590 day timer, signed off at Sunrise, 
[01:03:30]  Sunset, rather.  They were pretty bad.  They were pretty, pretty darn bad.  But this is probably worse.  Agapame to Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony show.

Home of the brave and playground of the red-blooded powderhounds.  Visit Steamboat.com.  Western ski areas continue to add on to snow.  They're skiing and riding practically everything like at Vail. 
[01:05:00]  Over 5,100 acres are open with packed powder.  Aspen, Colorado at 73 runs nearly every trail open.  The Canyons in Utah cruising to 95% of their trails on patch powder.  Sun Valley with a little new snow in Idaho.  All trails open.  Mount Hood Meadows in Oregon with six lifts.  While at Squaw Valley, some fresh snow.  150 trails in eastern areas.  Holding tight with anywhere from loose, granular, wet, granular snow.  Depending on the elevation.  Snowshoe Mountain is ready with over 50 trails in West Virginia.  Including tubing and night skiing until 9 o'clock at night at Snowshoe. 
[01:05:30]  In the Adirondacks where Whiteface continues down over three dozen runs and 11 miles.  Jiminy Peak in the Berkshires with 30 plus trails.  Sunday River, Maine now over 30 miles.  I'm John Davis with the XM Radio Ski and Snowboard Report.  The stories.  Down the left field line.  Is it enough?  Good!  There it is!  62!  The memories.  Unbelievable!  A home run for Gibson.  And the Dodgers have won the game 5-4.  I don't believe what I just saw. 
[01:06:00]  The magic.  The Giants on the pellet!  The Giants on the pellet!  The passion is renewed this February as spring training opens for the 2005 season.  The hopes and dreams of 30 Major League teams are told on XM Satellite Radio like never before.  Get out!  He takes a shot at it!  Here it goes!  It is out of here!  Hear every play.  Every team.

[01:06:30]  Hear it on XM Satellite Radio.  The official satellite network service of Major League Baseball.  It's radio to the power of X.  All included as part of your basic monthly service plan.  Who wrote this spring?  It's everything.  24-7.  XM 202.  The O&A virus.  It's everything.  All the time.  XM 202.  The O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[01:07:00]  The assault on the media continues with the O.B. and Anthony program as we spread the O&A virus across America.  We got a nice 20-minute commercial on the Howard Stern show yesterday.  And also, we had signs all over WWE last night.  WWE.  Wrestling was at the Nassau Coliseum on Long Island. 
[01:07:30]  Raw.  Raw.  And our own Hawk was there with Danny the intern, right?  Yep.  And they did an unbelievable job.  And the stills are up on foundrymusic.com and opianthony.com.  They brought the big signs with our cartoon faces.  Did you bring shit dick?  I thought that might be pushing it right now.  Yeah, that probably would have been pushing it.  That's the new atom bomb.  It just sits there, quietly, waiting.  I think Where's Chester would have been funny.  Where's Chester? 
[01:08:00]  Or Lil' Connor or Donkey Sausage even.  We had a couple homemade signs.  One that said, it's a tsunami, happy new year.  And we had our own homemade Lil' Connor.  Very good.  Yeah, but, I mean, these guys got major exposure for us last night.  Very, very good.  Yeah, they were pissed.  Yeah, yeah.  What happened?  NASA Coliseum Security, they were just trying to find us.  They had this one camera on top of the TitanTron.  They're trying to find what section we're in.  And then about an hour and a half into the show, all of a sudden security comes over. 
[01:08:30]  They said, we'll take those, take all the signs right out of our hands.  Why?  They said, that's advertising and you've gotten too much and you're not supposed to be doing this.  If I see another sign, we've got to throw you out.  So I said, okay.  I was leaving anyway.  It did its job, though.  We got what we needed.  Another nice hit on the assault on the media.  Unfortunately, we're doing it all ourselves.  Eventually, the listeners will take this and run with it.  Yeah, they see how much fun it is when they watch it at home and go, I could do that.  Yeah, but a lot of people from all over the country. 
[01:09:00]  Max from Cleveland, Ohio.  Opie and Anthony signs in the audience at WWE last night.  Great to see that S again.  Yeah.  Keep it up, guys.  Yeah.  Well, you know, we gave up on the gang in Washington actually promoting the Opie and Anthony show.  They've been telling us since we signed in the summer that there was going to be a huge promotional thing that was going to happen with national TV spots and billboards.  And huge trucks driving across America with our faces on it saying they're back, they're on XM Satellite Radio.  This is all stuff that was told to us. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, we remember that.  When they were trying to sell us coming to XM Satellite Radio.  And we know we made the right choice and all that.  But they've kind of let us down in that department.  So we're not going to sit around and wait.  Once they sign you, some of those things kind of go away.  Happened when we signed the other contract, too, though.  Yeah, I know.  We've been around long enough to know.  But we were thinking that this was going to be different.  I remember Lawyer Lady, as soon as we signed the contract, there was no bubbly or anything.  She grabbed the contracts and ran.  Ran out of the office.  Ran out of the conference room. 
[01:10:00]  And then the next thing you know, there was another representative from XM Satellite Radio going,  OK, guys, we've got to get you to the train.  Your train leaves in 20 minutes.  Yeah.  What?  What happened?  I was thinking big celebration.  We're finally back in radio.  No.  Lawyer Lady grabs these contracts that had to be, I don't know, an inch thick.  Yeah.  And runs away.  And that was it.  Left us at the train station.  That was our welcome to XM Satellite Radio.  And then all of a sudden, we did a couple cute little promotional things around the country. 
[01:10:30]  And then all marketing and promotion pretty much went away.  Stopped.  So we said, all right, well, we'll do it ourselves.  And the listeners have been helping us out with this grassroots effort.  And the assault on the media has been going pretty well so far, right?  Right.  Last week, we got some major exposure on Good Morning America.  Last night, it was WWE, which doesn't really get big ratings anymore.  But we'll take it.  Yeah.  They're in one of their phases, I guess.  Because that really, the wrestling, like, takes off sometimes. 
[01:11:00]  And it's the biggest thing ever.  And then it goes away, and people don't really watch it.  And that's kind of where it's at right now.  Yeah.  So.  I have a question for you.  Is there a bus that's not going to be out in Vegas?  Someone said there's going to be an O&A bus out there riding around, because it's going  to be so mobbed in Vegas this week.  I don't know.  I really don't know.  We did get told that, though.  Oh, okay.  A bus?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, if we need to get places?  No, no, no.  Straley said that we may broadcast from it, which before we knew where we were broadcasting.  Oh.  Well, why don't you bring it up in the meeting?  Oh, yeah.  So we have a meeting today. 
[01:11:30]  We have a meeting today?  Today?  Yeah, Norton is just an animal in these meetings.  It's great to see.  Oh, I know.  It's great to see.  We sit around.  I play video games.  I listen.  And Jimmy's just, like, hovering over the speakerphone.  He's an attack dog.  One more thing.  One more thing.  And, you know, on the other side, on the other end of the line, they're just like,  Oh.  He wants to smash my little uninvited face.  It's that Jim Norton again.  Why doesn't he shut up?  Yeah, I really don't know.  I know we took some pictures yesterday.  I think they're going to do something with that.  Oh, great.  They had an awful one of you two. 
[01:12:00]  Ant wanted to punch the guy's computer screen.  I was like, Oh, that's perfect.  That's great.  Just awful.  It was awful.  No one told me.  I didn't get an email that they were taking pictures yesterday.  So, of course, you know, all disheveled.  Model diva.  Model diva.  Photo diva.  Wait, Bernie's here with his music?  Yeah, he brought his CDs.  We've got to look them up.  Wow, he brought his own CDs.  Well, no, none of them are in the cases, so we've got to get them out of the lead.  So it's going to be in a few minutes.  Not a lot of Motown, I take it.  Wait, he didn't want to bring his actual CDs?  He says it's been a long time since he's listened to some of them. 
[01:12:30]  All right.  So he's only got the cases.  All right, give me, give me.  Here, give some to Anthony.  Here, Anthony.  Let's see.  So Bernie Getz is the subway vigilante who pretty much wanted to kill four black guys,  but only injured them.  Injured.  So he brought in some CDs, and he's going to guest DJ today.  Holy crap.  Could you get a disease from touching his CDs?  Dude, look at the dust on this thing.  I know.  This came off a shelf.  Look at this thing.  He's got Corey Hart, the singles. 
[01:13:00]  I wear my sunglasses at night.  He had one hit.  That was the only hit, right?  That I remember.  I'm looking at a copy of a Cindy Lauper.  She's so unusual.  All right, dude, I'm putting gloves on.  You're putting gloves on.  Pat Benatar.  Rocky Horror Show.  A couple good tunes on this.  All right, that was fun.  Here you go, Ben.  Thanks a lot.  All right, so Corey Hart, the singles, even though I only know of one song Corey Hart ever did.  Then he's got Seal, Crash Test Dummies.  Oh, there's blood on this one, I think. 
[01:13:30]  Look, a little bit of...  Chris Rhea.  I think I see a little sickle cell in it, too.  Oh, The Velvet Underground.  Okay.  That's all right.  And Ray Lynch, Deep Breakfast.  What's this?  I don't know.  We're going to have to...  That's probably like a New Age CD.  Talking Heads, True Stories.  Right here.  This is going to be awful.  Bon Jovi, Crush.  There you go.  Uh-huh.  Why are there no CDs in the cases?  He said that he... 
[01:14:00]  I don't know what he said.  Because he's an OCD freak.  You know why.  I don't want to lose them, but where does he store these?  I don't know.  Here.  I don't want them.  They're dusty.  There you go.  Very good.  Stores them in a big storage garage with a car with a head in it.  All right, so Bernie gets us here.  We thought he was going to blow us off, and he's going to guest DJ for a little while on  the program.  We'll see how it goes.  We're not going to let all the songs play, are we?  We'll play samples.  Yeah, we're going to have to. 
[01:14:30]  We can't play all the songs.  I don't know, Miss Moffat, the rest of me.  All right, Anthony, it's time for another reason the rest of the world hates us.  Uh-huh.  Of course, everyone's looking at the tsunami coverage.  Around-the-clock coverage now, Anthony.  Oh, enough already.  And it is quite a tragedy, as we all know.  Tragedy.  Even though, you know, the news people, you know, faking that they care.  Yeah, they don't care.  It's really starting to get to me.  They care about putting images on their shows that'll get the most viewers. 
[01:15:00]  Now they're using the coverage to brag that they have the best coverage, and this is the  place you need to be.  For all your tsunami coverage needs.  You know, the only people that care are the people that work for those networks, because  for us, the viewers, I can't tell the difference between the CNN coverage of the tsunami and  the Fox News Channel coverage of the tsunami and MSNBC.  It's all the same crap.  It is the same.  And they're trying to brag that they have the best coverage.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:15:30]  It's the same stuff.  They show the beach.  They might show some footage of the actual tsunami, but they pretty much have weaned  off of that now.  And then they show the beaches now.  They show the cleanup effort.  Where if you're in a country where your cleanup effort includes elephants, there's a problem  there.  Right.  There's probably, your problem's probably bigger than just using elephants to clean  up with.  Maybe if you weren't using elephants to do your construction and clean up with, maybe  you'd have some kind of warning systems in place and not that many people would have 
[01:16:00]  perished.  Hmm.  There you go.  Spend a little less time trying to get young boys and girls into the sex trades.  And, I don't know, invent some stuff.  Build some stuff.  Stop spending your money on terrorizing the rest of the world.  Big Muslim population over there.  Indonesia, yeah.  Oh, huge.  Jakarta.  And, yeah, get with the times.  It's the 21st century, I believe.  But it's kind of funny.  You watch CNN and Fox News and all that, and, yeah, they're showing, like, the relief 
[01:16:30]  efforts with the helicopters coming in and these people, the survivors, like, fighting  over canned goods and some water and maybe a bag of rice.  And they're literally ripping each other apart to grab the food, right?  Yeah.  And, yeah, like you said, they're showing the elephants trying to, like, you know, take  away the debris and stuff.  Move a house with an elephant.  Right, because they don't have, yeah, you said it, they don't have the heavy lifting  equipment.  Where's the bulldozers and cranes and stuff?  Come on.  Right.  So, as that's going on, you know, where they're just fighting for their lives over there, 
[01:17:00]  just to eat and stay warm and stay sheltered.  Yes, Opie.  There's a story that hits the New York papers today, Anthony.  And this is part of the reason we are hated around the world.  Now, whether this being hated is justified or not, that's open to interpretation, I guess.  But it is absolutely a reason we're hated.  It's the fact that we're so pompous as a country to some of these nations and people. 
[01:17:30]  They view us as pompous.  Arrogant is a word that's used a lot.  And, well, some of the news today, along with the tsunami effort that's going on, when you  see crowds of people grabbing up at helicopters and they're throwing water out to these people.  And then right next to it is the story, work begins on colossal artwork in the park, Opie.  They do this crap with Central Park every once in a while, and it's such a waste of time, waste of funds. 
[01:18:00]  Time and money.  And just plain stupid.  People are dead, dying, starving, homeless over there in the tsunami-struck area.  And here we go.  Central Park, 23 miles of the park's walkway will be covered with 7,500 gates festooned with  saffron-colored fabric panels.  This is what we do as they're fighting for food in Indonesia. 
[01:18:30]  23 miles long.  Yeah.  The cost?  Anybody would like to...  23 miles of saffron fabric.  100,000.  Well, I don't...  That's a lot of money.  But I don't...  As I just watched a skeleton getting into a helicopter.  Yeah, I don't get it, though.  So, what is...  It's just fabric, just kind of...  Yeah.  And what...  Over gates.  Over gates and what?  Just stretched out every 10 feet or something?  They'll have these fabric gates?  Very good. 
[01:19:00]  I'm not sure exactly how far apart they are, but yeah, yeah.  They're gates that stretch for...  Someone is claiming this is an art project, right?  Yes, it's art, Opie.  Okay.  Let's see.  At least since the park was designed.  Yeah, it's the first big artwork thing they're doing like this.  The gates by artist Christo and Jean-Claude.  Fags.  Oh, yeah.  Fags.  Busquake.  Faggot.  20 million dollars. 
[01:19:30]  20 million dollars.  To put temporary gates in a park?  To put...  Yeah, temporary gates and festoon those gates with saffron-colored fabric panels for 23 miles.  That's about a million bucks a mile.  A little less.  A million bucks a mile.  It would be nice to walk under that, I bet, though.  Ooh, the color was chosen to cast a warm glow over the park at a gray time of year. 
[01:20:00]  So, you know, if you're walking through Central Park and feeling a little down, you know,  because it's so gray and dismal out, no bloated bodies washing up on you or anything,  but, you know, you could get a little down.  At least you'll have a 20 million dollar festooned gate.  This is why we're hated in the world.  Things like this.  You know, they see things like this in the news, and it's like,  oh, those arrogant American bastards. 
[01:20:30]  Again.  20 million.  You know what we could do with 20 million?  Rebuild this entire town.  This entire village, yeah.  Probably rebuild all...  If they have little cities down there.  Yeah.  I don't even know.  A whole city.  But, no, we got to perk ourselves up because it gets a little gray in the park in the winter.  So, spend 20 million to festoon some gates with saffron-colored fabric.  And know who's going to appreciate that?  Just a bunch of art fags.  Gay guys, let's be honest.  Not many.  Just a few art fags. 
[01:21:00]  A few will think it's tacky.  Oh, wow, look how cool this is.  Ooh, look at that.  Everyone else is like, well...  The way the saffron fabric festoons those gates.  Everyone else will be like, uh, whatever.  What is this crap?  Right.  Uh, what does it mean?  Oh, the black people are going to tag it with spray paint and stuff.  It's just going to look like crap after a while.  It'll be vandalized.  How do you protect 23 miles of an art project through Central Park?  Well, that, I'm sure...  It'll be raped.  Someone's going to use the nice saffron-colored fabric to wipe their junk off after they raped some jogger. 
[01:21:30]  Those are the awful people.  Well, we got to find out more about this.  I bet you there's going to be a whole security detail that, you know...  Yeah, how about that?  How about the overtime for cops that have to guard this piece of crap?  And you know the cops...  We know the cops.  They're like, oh, crap.  I got to guard saffron freaking fabric.  Yeah.  That's nice.  That's what you went to, uh, the academy for. 
[01:22:00]  Let's see.  The city's Economic Development Corporation estimates the project will generate more than 80 million in revenue.  Why?  In New York City.  People coming from out of town to see...  To see the...  Stop it!  Let's see.  They, uh...  Buh-buh-buh.  Said that once visitors made the pilgrimage to see the gates,  they would also be staying at hotels, going to restaurants, museums, Broadway shows,  and other attractions. 
[01:22:30]  Adding up to a significant boost for the city.  There can't be that many people that care that much about this stupid project.  No.  No.  Way.  80 million bucks, my ass.  Let's go to New York City.  Oh, yeah?  Why?  I want to go see the, uh, fabric in Central Park.  All right.  Let me book our hotel room and travel.  Let's walk under the art project of someone who will probably sooner or later be in a robe and weigh 80 pounds. 
[01:23:00]  Wow.  There you go.  Another reason the rest of the world hates us, Anthony.  There are so many details.  You have to be ready for anything, he said.  I guess the artist.  He bought 150 snow shovels to clean the paths in case of snow.  Hired 1,100 workers who come from 45 different states.  Why? 
[01:23:30]  I, am I like someone who doesn't understand art?  I don't get this.  Maybe, well, never mind.  I was asking for the impossible.  What?  I was hoping one of our listeners would actually understand art and tell us why this is good.  Yeah.  I don't think those people are listening to this program.  Not at all.  They just want to hear a girl shove a wiffle ball bat up their twat.  This guy's also been known to plant giant umbrellas in rice paddies near Tokyo. 
[01:24:00]  That's art.  And wrapping the Reichstag in material.  It's one of these, like, art guys that come up with these ideas.  Why do they entertain that?  How do you approach a city?  Like, if any one of us went up to Bloomberg and everybody in the city and just said, look,  I want to put a bunch of stuff in Central Park and wrap it in material, you'd be what?  They would laugh at you.  Yeah.  You'd deal with a secretary. 
[01:24:30]  You wouldn't get past her.  Right.  I'll let them know, sir.  Yeah.  Good.  Great idea.  What separates him from a kook?  I don't know.  Here you go.  Well, one of the reasons we're hated.  America.  America.  America.  Fuck yeah.  Come and be here to save the motherfucking day.  America.  Fuck yeah.  Freedom is the only way. 
[01:25:00]  Terrorists, your game is through.  Cause now you have to answer to America.  Fuck yeah.  Flick my butt and suck on my balls.  America.  Fuck yeah.  What you gonna do when we come for you now?  It's the dream that we all share.  It's the whole force of love.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah. 
[01:25:30]  Karma.  Fuck yeah.  The gas.  Fuck yeah.  Baseball.  Fuck yeah.  NFL.  Fuck yeah.  Rock and roll.  Fuck yeah.  The internet.  Fuck yeah.  Slavery.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Starbuck.  Fuck yeah.  Disney World.  Fuck yeah.  Porno.  Fuck yeah.  Value.  Fuck yeah.  Reeboks.  Fuck yeah. 
[01:26:00]  Fake tits.  Fuck yeah.  Sushi.  Fuck yeah.  Taco Bell.  Fuck yeah.  Rodeos.  Fuck yeah.  Fat Bath and Beyond.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Liberty.  Fuck yeah.  White slip.  Fuck yeah.

Squirt and shit.  Books.  What happened to the potatoes? 
[01:26:30]  I have no idea what you're talking about.  From ONA Pictures.  You always like potatoes.  That's not new.  A horrifying story.  Did he forget the potatoes?  Of a man.  I need the potatoes.  Without potatoes.  Danny, you forget the potatoes?  It won't happen again.  I can promise you that.  How far will one man go? 
[01:27:00]  Well, I'm going to have to wait for the potatoes.  For potatoes.  The Potato Diva.  My potatoes are here.  Come here.  Open your mouth.  Eat.  Eat.  Eat your potatoes.  That's the way to do it.  You say potato.  He says potato.  That's a big thing of potatoes, Danny.  Everything's delicious.  The Potato Diva.  I need the potatoes.  Yeah.  It's coming soon.  I want potatoes, and I want eggs, and I want hot sauce.

Those aren't real.  Yes, they are.  The Sunrise Mall parking lot near the Elephant Bar Restaurant on Sunrise Boulevard.  Detailed map on opiananthony.com.  I'm getting an erection as we speak.  Once again, here is how it should sound.  The Wow Sticker Stop.  Brought to you by your pals at the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:29:30]  People spell their name however they want.  Has nothing to do with phonics or nothing.  Not sure what phonics is, but...  I saw the girl that was hooked on it.  She's got a problem with it apparently.  Have you seen that commercial?  Hooked on phonics work for me.  She's adorable, you know.  I was thinking, wouldn't that be weird if she was applying what she learned and she couldn't get the commercial straight, you know? 
[01:30:00]  Hooked on phonics working for me.  Hooked on phonics working for me.  Hooked on phonics working for me.  Okay, cut.  You talk to her, mate.  We ain't going to move a lot of tapes this way.  Telling you right now. 
[01:30:30]  Anyway, I met this woman.  Her name was Amy, you know?  So I go, oh, A-M-Y?  She goes, no.  A-Y-M-I-E.  Oh.  I have to take a nap.  I'm Brian.  B-R-I-V-O-L-B-N.  The number seven, the letter Q.  Look at my name tag.  It's big.  You know, I started out in showbiz in about 19, really, I'd say 46, but actually it was 1944 when my front yard, my grandfather bought me a cowboy uniform. 
[01:31:00]  And they told me, don't slip in a dog poo-poo.  And I did.  And I just kept slipping in it and falling.  And they just laughed.  It was beautiful.  And that was my first comedy routine.  And I've just been slipping in shit ever since.  Turned into the ass. 
[01:31:30]  Get Anthony.  XM-202.  Oh, ha, ha, ha.  Get up.  Get down with the sickness.  Get up.  Get down with the sickness.  Get up.  Get down with the sickness.  Open up your head.  And then they're not running at me.  Get up.  Get down with the sickness.  You mother.  Get up.  Get down with the sickness.  You fuck.  Get up.  Get down with the sickness.  Get down with the sickness.  Get down with the sickness.  Get down with the sickness.  Get down with the sickness.  Get down with the sickness.  Get down with the sickness.  Get down with the sickness. 
[01:32:00]  All right.  Let's go to Utah and say hi to Justin.  Justin, what's up?  Hey, man.  Yeah, I got this tidbit on this artist that did something just as ridiculous.  I'm not sure if it's the same guy or not, but he took a similar fabric.  It's like parachute-looking material and wrapped the entire coastline in it for miles and miles.  I can't remember his name.  Look it up on the internet.  It's called Wrapped Coast is what he called it.  Yeah, I think that's the same guy. 
[01:32:30]  It was ridiculous.  I think he did like a bridge or something, some big, enormous thing.  He should use his fabric to hang himself.  There's an artwork.  Yeah.  What do you asphyxiate, sissy?  Yeah.  Enough with the fabric.  No one cares.  No one.  Well, when you have no artistic talent, all you can do is something big.  Yeah, he needs attention, obviously, huh?  Yeah, paint something.  Rockwell was an artist.  Yeah.  There's the old man with the kid.  I like that. 
[01:33:00]  Pablo Picasso didn't use fabric.  I don't like him.  I don't know where the nose is and the woman's head stops.  That was just one of the periods he went through.  I know.  I like when he went through his blue phase myself.  Jimmy, what did he blow?  Easy with that.  You know who loves Picasso?  People whose children have Down syndrome.  Looks like Junior.  You went through a blue phase, which was very interesting, yes.  Who painted the scream? 
[01:33:30]  That was a...  That is a great...  That was the dude from...  Renoir?  I don't know.  That was a...  Renoir?  No.  I have no idea.  Oh, everyone's screaming at their radios right now.  No.  No one is screaming at their radios right now.  Yeah, they are.  Most people know that one.  Ben, do you know it?  Wasn't that...  You were in boarding school in England?  Uh...  What, he was at a prep school? 
[01:34:00]  Art class?  How was that shepherd's pie you were enjoying?  Ben's eating soup.  Before the polo match, he'd have his art class, teach him about those things.  Soccer hooligan.  All right, let's go to Anthony in Oceanside.  Anthony?  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Anthony.  Hello, sausage cock.  Hi, Anthony.  Thanks for calling.  Let's watch the language.  I'm sorry to ask.  LOL.  You guys have cut Howard's nuts off.  I've never heard him crying on his knees like he was this morning. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, he's crying again this morning?  You don't understand how hard he's making fun of a marine science contract with Invisible  Inc.  I don't want to go anywhere.  I really don't want to get kicked off.  They do what they're going to do.  Just pay his bill.  I don't know.  I've been a bad boy.  He is such a little fucking pussy.  You guys really gave it to him.  Again, a second day?  The most important thing is he's saying Opie and Anthony.  Yep.  He mentioned it.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Keep it up.  Thank you.  You know what?  He's a fucking moron. 
[01:35:00]  He's a moron.  Dude, know what it is?  We kind of mentioned it yesterday.  He'll spend another hour pitching that he got taken off a few radio stations.  And the reason he's going to spend another hour today on that is because he didn't prepare  a radio show because he's just calling it in these days.  He doesn't want to, you know, entertain his audience anymore.  He has nothing funny or clever to do anymore.  So he'll have all these excuses why he's not doing a radio program anymore.  No, but he used to just go off on a tirade when he, you know, years ago.  Now he's just sitting in his chair like, oh, what am I going to do? 
[01:35:30]  Because he knows we have talent.  He knows we have an audience, so he can't, like, try to chop us down, you know?  And then this will go away, and then he'll blame Bush for not being able to do a program.  It's one excuse after another why he can't do a radio program, why he can't be funny anymore,  why he can't be entertaining, why he can't be clever.  There's so many things you can still do on commercial radio.  And it finally settled in his head that he has another year to go before he can gain any kind of popularity. 
[01:36:00]  Now he's stuck in a fucking time warp.  He doesn't know what to do.  He's finished.  There you go.  Thank you, Anthony.  All right, boys.  Punch it up.  It's all about, you know, just calling it in these days and coming up with reasons why he can't actually do a radio show.  Blame, blame, blame.  Dave in San Diego.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Jimmy.  What's up, sunshine?  How you doing, West Coast Dave?  Thanks for calling the program.  No problem, brothers.  Hey, that's that Chris dude that did this doing that shit there in New York. 
[01:36:30]  He put up a bunch of umbrellas out here in L.A. up on the grapevine about 10 years ago.  And there was some dumb woman standing out taking a picture of him.  And one blew over and killed her.  Stop.  Really?  Are you kidding?  No, I swear to God.  Perfect.  Come on.  Someone find that story.  I mean, I want to believe that.  They would not let this guy do anything if that happened.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I was out here about 10 years ago, maybe 11, something like that. 
[01:37:00]  And he put all these big-ass umbrellas up on the grapevine.  Oh, that's funny.  And one blew over and killed her.  That is really funny.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  All right, brother.  All right.  So what's the story with Bernard Goetz?  Oh, we have to get all his songs right now.  Just take a few minutes.  Do you want to bring him in?  Is he preparing?  What is he doing?  He's playing chess, actually.  I got a game.  Wow.  He's playing now.  Jimmy cares more about a stupid chess game with Master Poe than doing a radio program. 
[01:37:30]  Where are you going?  We're doing a radio show.  Who cares?  I want to make sure Bernie's not touching my chess pieces.  I'm killing Master Poe.  Bernie's probably very good.  How about you play chess after the radio program?  I play during the program.  I run out on the brakes.  Anthony and I, you know, we're sitting here before the show panicking, thinking we might  not have enough material today, and you're starting up a game with Master Poe.  Because I had faith in you guys.  There he is.  Oh, well, gee, thanks.  Bring in Bernie for it.  Honestly, can we try the two-minute rule with Bernie?  Oh, please.  It didn't work with Lady Di this morning. 
[01:38:00]  Two-minute rule.  He's got to get his stuff.  Of course.  What is he getting?  His Prozac and his gun?  He's got that juice again that looks like 40.  Do you play chess?  Good morning.  I used to.  I used to go.  Hey, Bernie, I got a question for you.  You seem like the...  You're beating up on each other right there.  Bernie, I got a question for you.  Because you seem like the...  Oh, wow.  People are suggesting songs you should play.  That's really funny.  You two's Bull to Blue Sky.  Happiness is a Warm Gun by the Beatles. 
[01:38:30]  That's a good one.  Drop something.  Love Gun by Kiss.  You guys are brilliant, man.  Very funny.  Hit me with your best shot, Pat Benatar.  We missed the obvious.  Shoot to Thrill?  No, no, no, no.  That's a good one.  No, no, no, no.  Now, Bernie, I got a real question for you.  You got to focus for a second, okay?  Anything from 38 Special?  Keep them coming in, boys.  Now, listen.  You seem like the artistic type, right? 
[01:39:00]  Eccentric type.  Not artistic.  Eccentric?  I have a touch of artistic.  Okay.  All right.  Quick question before you go off on a 20-minute tangent.  You know that famous painting, The Scream?  No.  Oh.  Yeah, you do.  The guy has his hands on the side of his face and his mouth wide open.  That's Daryl Cabe.  No, stop it.  No, okay.  There are things to scream about in the world.  Oh, yeah.  Horrible things.  No, you don't know the-  People eating meat.  You don't know the famous painting, The Scream?  What?  You really don't know the famous painting, The Scream?  I think vaguely I have a memory of some horrible thing. 
[01:39:30]  It's like surrealistic.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yes.  Go ahead.  What about it?  Do you know who did that famous painting?  No, it's not my- I don't particularly like that painting.  It's okay.  I mean, I understand the message.  Because like you, I have OCD, and now I'm not going to be able to continue with the show  until I know who did that.  Who did the painting.  But what is- but what does it matter?  Huh?  It's a really famous painting.  But there are paintings of horror, and there's terrible things that happen in the world.  There's good things.  I think that the important thing to life is to do good, and be happy, and enjoy it. 
[01:40:00]  And that is possible.  I mean, there's certainly a lot of bad things, too, but you just have to overcome them, you  know?  Sure.  All right.  Well, we got your CDs.  You're going to be a guest DJ today on our program.  Well, a little- well, as you guys think, as it's appropriate, we could play a song here  and there.  But I hope you don't hit me with those, like, you know, like in Pat Benatar, she does better  songs than Hit Me With Your Best Shot.  Oh.  On that one, I thought we were going to do Love is a Battlefield, or something like that.  Yeah, that's fine.  No, it was just-  You made a list up? 
[01:40:30]  What?  You got a list, right?  Yeah, life is a little bit of a battlefield, but mankind can overcome it.  Of course.  Of course.  Well, yeah, well-  All right, straighten up those papers.  Not what we're doing now, because-  Get them all straight and perfect.  There you go.  Now everything's right with the world.  Mankind on the planet is kind of like a tidal wave.  Yeah.  You know?  Oh, topical.  Yeah, and we should be more like the Nile.  The Nile?  The Nile, right.  And the way how things are going right now, you know, man should be a blessing to the planet,  and I think man can be.  I think vegetarian's important to that.  We'll get to that later. 
[01:41:00]  Edward Munch.  Edward Munch?  But he spelled his name E-D-V-A-R-D.  So is it Edward?  Edward.  Edward Munch did the scream.  Now all's right with the world, just like with you there, Bernie.  And what Ben said is maybe we could talk about running for mayor, New York politics,  No, we did that last time.  Yeah, no one really cares.  You're not going to win that election.  I'm voting for you.  I know that.  All right.  Well, maybe good things can come out of it.  What we want you to do is to pretty much be a DJ and, you know, talk a little bit about  the song before you play. 
[01:41:30]  Then we'll play the song until we're bored with it.  Then we'll stop that song.  And then we'll start another one.  How does that work?  Oh.  You're going to talk it up, though, right?  Oh, well, a little bit.  I mean, there's not much to say about what I think is quality.  Well, maybe why you picked that song, though.  We could start off with a nice, thoughtful song.  How about...  Well, we're not starting now, Bernie.  Oh, okay.  Whenever you want.  This was just the get to know you a little bit.  Pre-show.  Pre-show.  Yeah.  Maybe Sweet Jane would be a good song.  I love Sweet Jane. 
[01:42:00]  That's the only one I...  Well, let me see your list.  Who sings that, Sweet Jane?  Velvet Underground?  With the Lou Reed, right?  Yeah.  Not into the Lou Reed, really.  Well, not a lot of Lou Reed, but...  Well, I think there's a lot of good songs out there.  Your first one is a horrendous choice.  What was that Lou Reed song?  And the color boy goes, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.  The order of that list doesn't mean anything, but what was the first song?  Enigma is...  Then we won't play it.  Enigma is good music to have to there, Bernie.  You got an Enigma song on the list, I see.  Well, so I just... 
[01:42:30]  I had tons of CDs, and I just picked out a pile of...  All right.  Very good.  ...decent ones, but...  You know, and if you don't like a song, like a lot of people...  No, no.  ...don't like a certain song that another person will like.  Right.  All right.  Well, all right.  Okay, no, we'll cross that one off.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It's your thing.  You've got to play what you like.  No, no, it's your thing.  If you guys...  Bernie, that's just my opinion.  Don't let Gropey Opie decide what you want to play.  How about a Patti Smith song?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now you're talking.  Okay.  You like that?  Yes. 
[01:43:00]  All right.  Okay.  So why don't you leave the studio?  We just wanted to say hi to you.  It's been a while.  Yeah.  And get ready, and we're going to get you on at 8 o'clock.  So whatever you have to do to prep, if you need to do some drugs, or you want to smoke  some pot or something?  No, I already had my toque this morning.  That's my wake-up coffee.  I take one toque.  Just one?  Or two toques.  Sometimes two toques a day.  It was just a little bit in a pipe.  For the whole day?  Yeah.  That's my wake-up coffee.  I mean, if there were something special happening, I might take a toque in the evening.  But I do that not even once a month, maybe twice a month. 
[01:43:30]  What does that make you want to sleep, right?  If you smoke pot, I couldn't do anything after I smoke pot.  Different people react differently.  Some people like to eat, and some people like to sleep.  For me, it makes my neurons stink.  It makes my neurons fire.  Janie's Got a Gun by Aerosmith.  Very good choice.  Good one.  From the listeners.  Okay, well, that's the listeners.  Okay, guys.  So you prepare the stuff?  Yeah.  You get prepared.  I am prepared.  You don't have any guns on you today, right?  Nothing?  No.  Master Poe did his job?  I was thoroughly searched.  Okay, no weapons.  You're right there.  And the reason he does it, I think, I figured it was weird. 
[01:44:00]  Well, the reason he does it is because you shot four black guys over five stupid dollars.  One of your own employees probably carried a piece in here once.  Yep.  And that's why.  Ah.  The little guy out there with the beard.  And that's why everybody searches for a gun coming.  It's the you guys.  They have to worry more about you than the public.  Do you see the guy out there with the beard that runs Frank's place?  He actually was arrested on sodomy charges, and that's exactly why they have those things.  Jesus.  I thought you got along with him.  I do, actually.  With the oompa loompa now.  I like him a lot, actually.  Now, take that back, because he can see me now.  He can't sue me.  Sure he can.  Well, he can't. 
[01:44:30]  I didn't say he was convicted.  All right.  Well, thank you, Bernie.  We can't wait.  Bernie gets.  Never convicted.  The subway vigilante is going to be guest DJing on our show today.  All right.  Jesus.  But is he going to talk up the songs?  Yeah.  It's going to be great.  He'll be fine.  I think he's got some good taste in music.  I think it's going to be good.  Him talking up a song will take longer than Freebird plays.  Apparently, he stores his CDs behind the refrigerator.  I know.  Or dusty and greasy.  It's unbelievable.  Ben?  Yes.  What's going on? 
[01:45:00]  He's, like, just causing havoc.  He likes to talk, so now I just stuck him with one of the interns.  I said, talk to Mike for a few minutes.  Do you have it off outside?  It doesn't matter if it's off.  He doesn't care.  He doesn't care.  Yeah, he doesn't care.  Eric's getting all his songs.  A few more minutes.  All right, good.  Let's go to Jim in Tennessee.  Jim, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I was listening to John and Jeff this morning.  Who the hell are you?  Well, are they on XM, right?  Yeah, they're on XM.  They're out of L.A. or something?  Yeah, in L.A.  They're part of Viacom, apparently.  And they were doing a Howard Stern thing about the O.A. versus Howard Stern thing. 
[01:45:30]  And they mentioned immaturity on O.A.'s part.  And so I had to call in and kind of defend my guys.  Hold on.  Let me ask you a question.  Go ahead.  Did they trash O.A.  or were they kind of being fun with it?  No, they weren't.  They weren't.  These guys have no sense of humor whatsoever, Jimmy.  They're dicks.  I've heard that show. 
[01:46:00]  Hold on.  I don't mean to interrupt you, but that's the show I was telling you about.  Remember, I didn't want to mention the name, so I was being polite.  Uh-huh.  Me and I told Open End about this.  Me and Florentine were driving back from Albany.  Yeah.  And this show was atrocious.  It is.  The two biggest nerds I've ever heard just trying to be funny and using words like heck,  and he said this woman did something and he called her the B word.  Oh, yeah.  It was atrocious and unlistenable.  Figures they don't like this show. 
[01:46:30]  West Coast faggots.  What a shock.  All I could stand of it was like 20 minutes of it, but there was nothing.  I mean, there was just replays going on on 150.  But it came on, it was about 4.30 Eastern time, but they were doing a good trashing  on you guys versus Howard.  They keep talking about this.  Let them trash.  Another free commercial for Open End, Anthony.  Another show falling into the trap.  I love it. 
[01:47:00]  What's immature?  Because the show wants to succeed, you West Coast unfunny faggots with your mom and pop humor?  That's exactly what I pointed out.  God, do they stink.  I listened to their show.  I didn't get one laugh out of it.  It was boring.  There's nothing worse than cornballs who are boring, and you guys are both.  John and Jeff.  No one named John and Jeff can possibly be funny.  You know what you guys are good at?  Here's our show.  Faggots.  Unfunny cornball faggots. 
[01:47:30]  It's like a Republican giving a Democrat a blowjob or vice versa, whichever.  Uh-oh.  But I think...  Thanks, man.  Well, come on.  You walked right into that one.  Yeah, you were feeling a little too confident with your phone call.  You were doing real well, but man...  Oh, that really annoys me.  I purposefully didn't lay into those unfunny jizz bags just because I'm like, well, there's  no reason to trash the guys.  They're on XM.  They're being played on XM.  I hope you're both killed in a drunk driving accident. 
[01:48:00]  Well, anyway, I got in there, and they did let me on the air.  Of course they did.  There's nobody else calling their show.  It stinks.  But then they did do the hang-up on me, so...  Because I was...  Oh, and did that hurt your feelings, Jim?  Oh, yeah.  It just broke my heart.  What channel are they on, dude?  Let's give them a promotion.  What channel are they on?  152.  152.  You want to hear a couple of unfunny faggots who have seeds in between their teeth? 
[01:48:30]  Turn that show on.  What time is it on?  It's on, I believe...  Well, it's till 5 o'clock in the morning, so I'm guessing somewhere between 2 and 5.  They say it's overnight.  I never listen to them.  I encourage our listeners to tune in and enjoy the comedy stylings of...  What are their names?  John and Jeff.  Tune in and enjoy these two funny West Coast guys.  I believe...  All right.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats. 
[01:49:00]  Here comes a whopper.  All right.  Thank you, Jim.  Daryl Cabe laughs harder when he sees brand new running shoes.  Oh, wow.  Jimmy, you're the best.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to be immature.  That's why you're in radio, because you're grown up.  It's thinking like that that makes you not funny.  I just love these idiots that play right into our hands.  Exactly.  They have no listeners.  Nobody cares about them.  Thank you, Jim.  I just hung up on you.  I hope that didn't bother you.  Let's say hi to Mike in Jersey City.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Just wondering if you saw a coincidence that Bernie's first song choice was Sweet Jane, 
[01:49:30]  which is the main song in Natural Born Killers.  That's right.  It is.  Good one.  I have to watch that movie again.  I haven't seen that in a while.  Yeah, it's great.  I love that movie.  All right.  Very good.  Bernie, what are you going to eat?  Let's give that key lime pie a day in court.  And Ron Coobie will take $43 million from it.  Oh.  All right.  The John and Jeff Show.  Apparently, somebody in California was killed by one of those umbrellas that this artist put up.  Really?  Yeah.  And a worker was killed in Japan. 
[01:50:00]  It was underneath high tension wires in a wet rice field.  And electricity jumped.  And bye-bye.  They didn't know he was dead for three weeks because the expression on his face didn't change.  So two people gone from his artwork.  This artist is causing deaths?  Yeah, from his artwork.  All right.  John and Jeff.  Dude, who cares?  Keep talking.  I'll tell you why I care because I listened to them one night and it was so unfunny it made me angry. 
[01:50:30]  It made me angry.  It was so bad.  I'm like, is this what's on commercial radio?  Me and Quarantine laughed.  We're like this.  Laughing at them.  We were obsessed with how bad it is.  He would call me and go, dude, I heard them again.  They're terrible.  And we would laugh about it.  Oh, those Opie and Anthony are really immature.  Immature.  That's us.  Jackass.  Shannon from Ohio.  Norton, you pussy.  You'll tool on John and Jeff but won't say shit about Howard.  Pussy.  Because John and Jeff would just tarry into us for no reason. 
[01:51:00]  Howard and Opie and Anthony don't get along.  I have no fear of trashing Howard.  Stupid.  He's not a bandwagon jumper.  Absolutely.  I don't do anything because anybody else is doing it.  Right.  What, am I going to go on a show next week?  Hey, I didn't say nothing bad.  Can I come on and promote a gig?  Not happening.  I'll never be on that show.  You don't think?  No, it's fine.  I'm here.  After we're done, fired for the last time. 
[01:51:30]  I'll just shoot myself.  That's what I was going to do last time anyway.  Where am I going after this?  Guess spots on other shows.  Maybe John and Jeff will have me on.  Hey, I can guess which one of you has AIDS.  Oh no, both of you.  Trick question.  Jesus.  Scumbags.  You're really upset about John and Jeff.  They're not funny guys.  That's what bugs me because they're such corn balls.  We just gave them a commercial.  Now I got to hear them.  Yeah, please.  Tune in to John and Jeff.  Now I got to check them out.  Tune in. 
[01:52:00]  Got to see what it's all about there.  You might drive off the road and hit something.  You'll be laughing so hard.  Ugh.  All right.  They're as funny as holding your fiance's hand while the water gets sucked quickly away from the beach.  Oh, man.  Are you talking about the model and the boyfriend?  No.  Actually, I was just thinking of any of the 150,000.  Sorry, I didn't mean to be immature.  Chris in Connecticut, what's going on?  You know, John and Jeff are the ones that start the show off with,  We're two guys that think it's not all right to not shake the HL support. 
[01:52:30]  We're two guys that think that Jay Walken should be against the law.  They're just, yeah, they're very unfunny.  Oh, dude.  There's nothing worse to me than a vain attempt like that.  They're just not funny guys.  Yeah.  They don't have the gift.  They're at like 3 in the morning, and honestly, I put them on because it helps me fall asleep.  I'm an insomnia.  John and Jeff are at like 3 in the morning.  Oh, okay.  Oh, I'll ride asleep in like 5 minutes.  That's classic.  All right.  Thank you, Chris.  And I'll tell you why. 
[01:53:00]  Another reason that these guys annoy me so much is because you can't say that Howard has never been funny  or Imus has never been funny or whatever you want to say about any of the DJs in the country.  But I listen to these guys.  They're not funny, and that is just a sin to try to be funny like that on a consistent basis  and to miss every time.  Okay.  I think we're ready for Bernie, right?  Oh, yeah.  We don't pay child support.  We're the type of guys that think it's okay to pay child support.  Ha, ha, ha.  I like these regular guys.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  I don't think it's okay to pay child support. 
[01:53:30]  A rowboat in Modesto.  That's what you do.  Oh.  Rob in Arizona.  Hey, how's it going, fellas?  All right.  Hey, I think Bernie's got himself a little pattern going here.  You're talking about Sweet Jane by Cowboy Junkies off the Natural Born Killer soundtrack.  You got the Patty Smith he was talking about who sings that Rock and Roll Nigger song,  which is on the soundtrack as well.  All right.  Well, we don't know which songs he's playing from all these artists.  Well, we know he's playing Sweet Jane, but yes. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, it's playing the Velvet Underground version.  Yeah, yeah.  That sounds like a good Subway song.  All right.  Well, thank you.  All right.  Punch it out.  Should we step aside and let Bernie do his thing?  Is it going to be immature?  Whatever his thing is.  Huh?  It's not going to be immature, is it?  I don't want anything immature on the show.  No, very mature.  It's got to be mature.  It will be.  Very mature.  Two mature guys.  Here's a Bernie Getz promo thing that I think this is a Drew Boogie creation.  All right.  And Bernie Getz will be guest DJing next for a little while. 
[01:54:30]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Nothing.  I can't imagine what he's going to do.  What is he doing now, Ben?  He's out there talking to Mars now.  He just finds someone.  Everyone walks away, and then he finds someone that will talk to him.  Like, I don't think he's got any skills, any DJ skills that he can talk up a record.  That's what makes it good.  Of course.  That's why I need to be a program director.  I could save all these stupid radio stations in New York.  Hire Bernie Getz?  You hire a Bernie Getz.  You hire a homeless guy.  All that stuff.  Tippy Tom.  You hire that Frankie Blue guy after he drops acid, or whatever the hell he drops. 
[01:55:00]  Frankie Blue.  Yeah.  I would put together a great lineup of DJs.  Who would tune away?  Who would tune away?  Yeah, you forget.  What the hell is this?  What the hell was that?  What is going on, man?  Is that that man? 
[01:55:30]  Wow, there's two CDs in here.  Did you put two CDs in the CD player?  That's impossible.  They were on top of each other, and it was playing?  Honestly, I might have.  That's amazing.  No, I might have, actually.  Because we played, what?  Team America, right?  Yeah, that might have been my fault.  What, did you think it was a record player?  And they dropped down?  That was really weird.  All right, here's the Bernie Getz promo done by...  Come on, cue up.  Drew Boogie.  Presenting the wit and the wisdom of New York City subway vigilante, Bernard Getz. 
[01:56:00]  Bernard Getz.  How you been?  Pretty good, pretty good.  Uh, uh, uh, Ben, okay, okay, uh, that was rather confused, uh, was, uh, uh...  Do you consider yourself more, uh, Democrat or Republican?  Uh, neither.  Let me, let me, uh, what I'm going to say now, this is...  Just get a hold of yourself.  Uh, uh, uh, I'm a little embarrassed.  Well, I, I think, uh, uh, I think...  Hello!  And, and, and, and, oh, they're dangerous, too.  It's, but anyway...  Uh, uh...  Oh, Jesus Christ.  And, and I, I, I... 
[01:56:30]  Have you ever asked somebody on the subway for five dollars?  Okay, no.  Five shots and they're still alive.  Uh, uh, uh, just, uh, because...  Let me, let me, uh, what I'm going to say now, this is...  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Poker chip this motherfucker.  All right, Bernie.  Bernie, let's say a lovable character like Fat Albert asks you for five dollars.  Would you shoot him in the chest?  Ah!  And you'd say, hey, hey, hey, you don't look so bad.  I, I, I...  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I, I, I could have said...  I don't recall, but there could have been things like that.  Should, should, if, if you're the... 
[01:57:00]  If...  Ah!  It hits you on the, uh, the, the head with a pipe.  No, it's not...  Focus, Bernie.  No, it's not...  I mean, boy, talk about, uh...  The, the, uh, uh, uh, uh, I, I...  I, I, you know, we wanted to conduct some type of interview.  I, well, uh, uh, I, uh, but, but, uh, I'm not...  Son of a bitch!  Shut up!  Okay, well, we can do funny.  It's disgusting.  Well, I don't really...  Anyway, there's things that I think that are...  You sure like to talk, Bernie.  I've got to tell you. 
[01:57:30]  I'll talk about two separate things.  At the same time?  Okay, well...  I've got to thank you for being here.  Thank you.  Well, thank you.  It's, uh...  Okay.

[02:01:30]  Yes.  Our new acquaintance?  Dare we call him friend?  Yeah, I'd like to...  I think I'd like to call this guy my friend.  Our friend, Bernie Guest.  There's just something about him.  Kind of a cool friend to have.  That is just fascinating.  Yeah, Bernie Guest is going to enter the studio.  He's the subway vigilante.  Legendary story. 
[02:02:00]  20 years ago, he decided to shoot four black guys on a subway because, you know,  they asked for five bucks and it looked like they were going to harass him.  And he did quite a bit of damage that day, Anthony.  He felt as if he was threatened.  He was going to be robbed.  And maybe a bodily injury was going to come to him.  So he unloaded.  Shot four of them.  Didn't kill one of them, though.  Wow, he's pushing the door.  You can let him in.  Let him in.  Yeah, he's ready, man.  He's ready to be a guest DJ.  The next mayor of New York is coming in. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, the next mayor of New York.  He's now running for mayor, Anthony.  But it was a huge story.  If you want to Google it, if you're from somewhere else in the country, maybe you're not familiar  with the whole story.  It was quite a story.  Yep.  Back in 1984, right, Bernie?  Oh, yeah.  Matter of fact, when you came on our show for the first time, it was a day or two after  the 20th anniversary of you trying to kill those four black kids.  Well, okay.  Kids.  Three were 19.  I hope he makes it sound so nice.  But, yeah, you Googled Bernie.  Yes. 
[02:03:00]  B-E-R-N-I-E.  Yeah, but we were quite flotting.  It was a matter that you picked our program for the 20th anniversary.  Oh, well, no.  It's a cool show.  By the way.  Did you do anything special for the 20th anniversary?  Yeah, did you celebrate in any way?  Of the subway shooting?  No, you just think about things.  Yeah.  You think about doing the right thing, you know, and stuff.  By the way, on this, you know, you talk about the shooting.  You don't look too bad.  Here's another stuff.  The right way to shoot somebody, you just shoot them quick.  You don't have to make any speeches or anything.  Just boom.  Not like the movies, right?  Well, right, right.  They did some cheap little movie, and it was basically, you don't make any speeches. 
[02:03:30]  You just shoot the guy.  Boom.  Just shoot the guy.  The cleaner the kill, the better.  I made a movie on you?  No, not on me.  No, no, no.  It was just a really horrible movie he did.  Why didn't they make a movie?  Tony Soprano doesn't believe in torture or anything.  He hopefully believes in a clean kill.  But anyway.  Why didn't they do a movie about your whole thing?  It's an old story.  I don't know if it would be created a movie.  I mean, back then, you know.  I think now anything happens, and they make a movie about it.  Anything.  But I think you were right at the beginning of that. 
[02:04:00]  I think a few years later, if you would have done it, there would have been, you know,  three network movies.  Subway Goodman.  The whole commercialism was done wrong.  One of the original attorneys, who actually was a rather bad attorney.  Fix those papers, Bernie.  A bad attorney.  There you go.  It's just about a bad attorney.  Look how perfect they look now.  Nice pile in front of you.  The good suggestion he made is we should try to commercialize the whole story and have  the guy who's crippled would get all the money.  And he tried to get that compromise, but he couldn't get it.  He couldn't work it out with the other attorneys. 
[02:04:30]  That would have been okay.  That would have also required a thorough investigation.  I'm going to control this today.  Bernie, when you hear the bell, that means you've got to stop with your thought, okay?  Okay, okay.  And then if you start up with that music again, the security will tie you to your chair.  Okay?  For ten minutes based on a vote.  That's why I like this guy.  Hell yeah.  Okay?  We don't understand each other.  You just be tied.  That's why I like him.  All right.  I'm going to be kind today, Bernie.  Let's say hi to Sean. 
[02:05:00]  Sean has something.  Sean, go ahead.  Yeah.  Hi, Bernie.  I was wondering if your favorite drink was a screwdriver followed by five shots.  I heard about that.  That old gag, right?  I don't like alcohol.  I like pot.  Like, you know, alcohol, it burns.  The Indians used to call it fire water.  Fire water.  Oh, really?  Sure, because it burns.  I've never heard that before.  I think alcohol is a little bit like sniffing glue, and yet it's so publicly accepted.  They also ran in circles, so it would rain.  They're not like the best.  You put a hydrocarbon in your bloodstream.  Right.  All right.  Let's go to Paul in Ohio. 
[02:05:30]  Paul?  What's up, Paul?  Don't listen to it.  We're on a little delay, so don't listen to that crap.  Go ahead.  You're on the radio.  Okay.  Fantastic.  Hey, I got a request for Bernie.  Yeah, he's going to be a guest DJ in a few seconds here.  Fantastic.  Looking forward to it.  I think he should lead off a little filter.  Hey, man, nice shot.  Hey, that's not a bad idea.  Oh, a request?  Yeah.  Will Bernie be taking requests?  Yeah, what would you do?  Sure, why not?  Just don't ask him for five bucks.  Maybe if this segment goes well, the next time, yeah, he'll come in as a guest DJ, 
[02:06:00]  but he has to play the songs requested by the listeners.  Oh, that's a good one.  No.  Or maybe we'll do that as the second half of this bit.  Yeah, I think that's what's going to happen, Bernie.  No, people shouldn't have to do anything.  You can talk about generalizations.  Like, there were some songs on my list you didn't like.  Knock them off because, you know.  No, but that's not, but everyone has different tastes in music.  Right.  You should play what you think is cool and don't listen to us.  Okay, but what you just said, though, why should a listener be allowed to edit the show  if you can't?  Okay, no, I'm saying suggestions are good.  We don't really edit this show, though.  We just throw this crap out there, and some of it sticks and some of it doesn't. 
[02:06:30]  Whenever it doesn't, it slides down off the wall and hits the floor.  Just because I didn't like Cyndi Lauper, yeah, yeah, do you want to play it or not?  Yeah, he does.  He should play it.  It's your taste.  That's okay.  It's your taste.  It has nothing to do with, you know, if you ask Jimmy, he would just play Black Sabbath all day.  Right.  Uh-oh.  It's not about my taste or about his taste or about Jim Garrison's taste.  That's why this is fascinating, to have Bernie Getz on the show playing what he likes.  Yeah, yeah.  Music can take you to a higher level, too.  It should take you to the astral plane.  Oh. 
[02:07:00]  Astral plane.  Yeah.  Nice.  Dreams.  You know, maybe the animals can communicate with us at night.  All right, well.  He'd be a great, like, old FM overnight jock.  Hell yeah, man.  With those, you know, talking like that, sure.  Get high before you shift and just let the music do the talking, you know?  Right.  If it's good music, yeah.  Good music can talk a lot.  Well, Steve threw together some promos for your guest DJ in here.  Oh.  Oh.  Let's listen to this first one here.  Last off.  I'm basically, you know, a no-nonsense guy. 
[02:07:30]  Hey, you better give me a 20 or something.  With Bernie Getz.  Then let's talk about emotional issues that'll keep your attention.  Wow.  That's pretty nice, right?  I like that.  I got your own sweepers and everything now.  Heavy stuff.  You know?  It sounds like a real promo that you would hear on a commercial radio station.  Coming up on the Bernie Getz Show.  I can show you the world.  Can I think?  It's the Bernie Getz Show.  I don't fear death. 
[02:08:00]  Well, no, we all die.  We all die.  Really?  Absolutely.  Different people have constraints that others do.  Like, this morning, there was something.  One of the guys in Indonesia, he said all his family had died except one of his daughters.  And he said he was in such a distressed condition.  He was thinking if things didn't change, he would have to kill himself and his daughter.  His daughter first.  Coming up on the Bernie Getz Show.  You have two American coins valued at 30 cents. 
[02:08:30]  One of them is not a nickel.  How is that possible?  I brought the hammer down on him.  It's the Bernie Getz Show.  I like him.  Why are you staring at my bell?  Like, action-packed.  Yeah, I get it.  I get it.  All right.  Ed, take your bell back because he's staring at it a little too intently.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  The, uh, uh, no, that is something to do, you know, that, that, that, uh.  All right, Bernie, I think it's time for you to, um, introduce your first song, right, Anthony? 
[02:09:00]  Well, we could do that.  All right, I mean, you could talk about the song a little bit and say whatever you want.  You know, don't talk more than, like, 30 seconds, though, if that's okay.  Those papers are messy.  Well, why don't we just start off with Sweet Chain by Lou Reed.  They're a little messy.  Oh, I live with paper.  Okay, what if I don't shuffle them?  What if they just look messy and they don't make noise?  Is that okay?  Yeah, they're okay.  Yeah, I think it's going to drive you nuts, though.  So, oh, I'm nuts already.  I see a line for the next promo.  The, the, uh, yes, why don't we start off with Sweet Chain? 
[02:09:30]  That's like, uh, you know, it's a nice, thoughtful song.  That's all you got for that song?  I mean, why do you like it?  And, uh, you know, who are you?  And, you know, you're a DJ.  You gotta, like, uh, you gotta, you know.  It's a thoughtful song.  You gotta sell yourself to the audience a little bit.  It's a what?  It's a thoughtful song.  It's one of Lou Reed's better songs.  Make like it's your show, Bernie, and not a guest on our show.  Right.  If you were just here alone, uh, how would you talk up the song?  Uh, well, I, I wouldn't talk up songs too much. 
[02:10:00]  I might talk about things that I, that I think, and like Opie says, let the, let the song do  its, you know, talking for it.  You know, it's, uh, if it were me, you know, I might say, uh, hey, by the way, were you  guys going to hook me up with a hooker?  That's what I came here for.  I thought you were going to hook me up with a hooker.  Oh, you do want the hooker after?  Well, I don't, well, it depends.  You see, if, if I figure.  I thought you weren't into that.  Yes, he is.  Just companionship.  If I could, if I just do things naturally, I could run for mayor that way, or I, or I might  change my name to, I might go to divinity school, change my name. 
[02:10:30]  It's a lot of publicity.  You get banged by a hooker.  It might help your, you know, your campaign.  Well, okay, but I could become a reverend, too.  You know, I'd change my name.  I'd become the reverend gravy, and I'd also, I'd wear a suit, and I'd take four or five  or six to one matching funds.  Why the reverend gravy?  Yeah, why, you're going to be on Ben's leg?  Is that like on the take?  It starts with a G, like my last name.  Uh-huh.  The reverend gravy and the six to one matching funds.  It's his radio name.  I'd have it. 
[02:11:00]  I'd be, yeah.  The reverend gravy.  Hey, it's reverend gravy with you.  All right, how about that?  All right.  How about a quick Bernie thought, and we'll play your first song here.  There are no thoughts in my mind.  Just play the song in my mind.  Here it is.  Here it is.  No, no, we've got to start, Bernie.  Now we officially start the Bernie Getz Show.  So it's a quick Bernie thought, and then intro Sweet Jane.  Whenever you're ready.  Cool song. 
[02:11:30]  Cool song.  Perfect.  Perfect.  Perfect.  Perfect.  Perfect.  Anyone who ever...  Wouldn't turn around and break it.  And anyone who's ever played a part  Wouldn't turn around and hate it 
[02:12:00]  Sweet Jane  Sweet Jane  Oh, sweet, sweet Jane  It was all because of this terrible, awful Negro  Stay out the bushes 
[02:12:30]  I got it from a Negro  Down by the alley  Waiting there for him to come home  Waiting down on and on the corner  Figuring ways to get back home  Sweet Jane 
[02:13:00]  Sweet Jane  Oh, sweet, sweet Jane  Hold it  The next man makes a move  The nigger gets it  All that uppity nigger went and hit me on the head with a shovel  Hey, where are the white women at?  Anyone who's ever played a part  Oh, that's me, that's me, that's me 
[02:13:30]  Anyone who's gonna live a lonely year  Anyone who's ever stood apart  Hey, let it play, let it play  Oh, yeah, well, it was playing  No, we're just getting a little taste, a little taste  That was very good  All right, so why don't you  We'd be here all day if we, you know  No, no, no, that was, you see, like, and that song, it talked about good things, like, you know, if, uh,  Why turn around and fake it?  You know, there are real things in the world  Why fake it? Pull the trigger 
[02:14:00]  And you see, like, on, yeah, yeah  And, wait, on the train, like, you know, you talk about, you know, black this, black that, whatever  Sure  The guys were a problem, no question about it  But all of us were pieces of work  I wasn't a problem on the train, but all of us were pieces of work  The world was crazier then  New York was crazier  It's a better place now  But what mankind does, there's a lot of craziness  But it's behind closed doors still  Like what?  That's what, a lot of stuff  That's why we should legalize pet  Pot, there's too much, there's too much hurt in the world 
[02:14:30]  There isn't enough enjoyment of life  If people do more good, there'll be more enjoyment  There'll be more happiness  Laughter is a good thing  So we all should go on the subway with guns and shoot people that we don't like?  No, no, no, no  No, I'm saying there's good things  Well, and sometimes you have to do, there's a time, there's a time for this, and there's a time for that  Is that so? Who made you pope in this dump, huh?  Well, that's from the Bible, you know, there's a time to do this  And you have to, it's what you, you shouldn't just be happy  With just things the way they are  If you do good 
[02:15:00]  If the world is going to pass, you should be happy  All right  Yeah  We're cakes for nothing  Do you want to?  I think people should be better to the animals  I think people should have good music  People should have more relaxing  Better to the animals  Yes, and people talk about that good, good somehow, is just supposedly if you're good to other people, that's enough  People should be good to all life  You know what I say when I see a chicken?  Don't just stare at it, eat it  Exactly  Well, if a creature, if we visited outer space  Yes  Some other planet, and they had animals like this  Yeah 
[02:15:30]  Would we start eating their animals, or would we, because they tasted good, or would we, would it be taboo to eat the higher life form, or would we eat them too?  We'd probably finger them first  Yeah, well, the way how things are now  That's why we need vegetarian options in the school lunch program  The kids are much more open-minded to it  Robert!  I swear I'll blow this nigger's head all over this town  That's a really nasty word, isn't it, Bernie?  Wow  Well, it's not such a good word to use, even in that movie 
[02:16:00]  I thought that was a funny movie  What movie was that from?  That was a Mel Brooks movie  Wow, Blazing Saddles  I don't remember the name  Blazing Saddles  Yeah  Okay, but why don't we intro the next song  It's Bernie Getz, everybody  Oh, well, wait a second  I don't even, have we picked up one?  Why don't we do Love is a Battlefield?  You know, like, the world shouldn't be a battlefield  It is now  People could change that  It's a battlefield for everyone  The animals, people  And people can change it  The world doesn't have to be a battlefield  Ooh 
[02:16:30]  That's very deep  Like the Nightbird, Alice in Steel with artillery  Exactly  We're only going to play a minute of this one  Is that okay?  I don't know, I like this song  Let it all go  Let it all go  We are young  Hearted to heart  We stay  No promises  No demands  Love is a battle 
[02:17:00]  Floating off  He's desperate to what he said  We're not strong  We are strong  No one can tell us where we're wrong  Searching our heart for so long  Both of us knowing  Love is a battle  Love is a battle 
[02:17:30]  Floating off  He's desperate  Do what he say  Do what he say  Okay, terrific  Stop whining  Stop it  Why do you hurt me so bad  Shut up  Shut up  Help me to know  Do I stand in your way  Or am I the best thing you have had 
[02:18:00]  You lack discipline  Believe me, believe me  I can't tell you why  But I'm trapped by your love  And I'm chained to your side  Cause I'm a schmuck  Cause I'm a schmuck  We are young  Hearted to hearted  We stay  No promises  Oh, madness  Madness, madness  Love is a battle 
[02:18:30]  We are young  This calls for the old Billy Bird  No one can tell us where we're wrong  I got it from a Negro  Searching our heart for so long  Both of us knowing  I think this place is restricted, wank  So don't tell me you're Jewish  Love is a battle  Ah, very good choice, Bernie 
[02:19:00]  Good enough  Pat Benatar, Love is a Battlefield, right?  Yeah  Anything else you want to say about that song?  Well, the world shouldn't be that place  And if there's any creature that has the power to change it  It's people  You  You  Man, we're like gods  There's no  You take a man with a rifle  You can put him on the plains of Africa  There's no animal you can't kill  Or the train  Kind of the same thing  Oh, the gun has changed a lot of things  They said, you know, it's Sam Colt  You know 
[02:19:30]  You're part of American gun history, too  That's right  How about that?  That's right  You know  And I buried that gun  I kind of wish I didn't  I could probably get $50,000  What, you buried the gun that you used in the subway shooting?  Up north, right?  When you fled?  Yep, in Vermont  The police went looking for it  Do you know about where it's buried?  I could find it if I wanted to  I was looking at the area  Wow, you could  Definitely  I think they may have built a house over it already  That was out in the woods  Wow, let's go find your gun, man 
[02:20:00]  It's broken up in pieces  It could be a nice weekend trip  You broke it up in pieces  Did you keep it in a separate bag  Or did you bury the pieces individually?  I think I  Maybe one or two holes  All within a few feet of each other  It was boggy, wet ground  Were you running across rooftops  Kind of dropping a long piece down the chimney?  Yeah, I wanted to get rid of it  I was going to get rid of the shoes  Little Clements that told them to hide these  I got rid of the jacket and everything  And then I was going to start 
[02:20:30]  I figured it was a real screwed up weekend  I was going to start the week all new  When it would be done and forgotten with  I thought it was a real good, clean getaway  You thought that was going to be it?  Yep  Like, no one would catch you?  Well, if I played my hand right  If it was cool, it was a great getaway  There was nothing  How the hell did you get caught?  I turned myself  Stupidity  I turned myself in  I talked to my downstairs neighbor  Then I turned myself in  They probably would have gotten you, though  They would have questioned me  Did you take that train a lot?  Did you?  Well, I would take the train once in a while 
[02:21:00]  I was in a rush to go downtown that morning  Or that afternoon  Yeah, but I mean  You didn't take it on a regular schedule?  No, I didn't  Because any time you're in a pattern  That's where they kind of get you  If they would have said  Let's see who was on this train  Get some witnesses  That's correct  They had police giving out flyers  All up and down the subway line  To everyone  But it turns out  I would take that train  Maybe  That particular line  On the order of once a month  Something like that  Maybe twice a month  I forget 
[02:21:30]  Did the composite sketch look like you?  Did you think it looked like you?  Well, it didn't look dissimilar to me  But witnesses on the train  Couldn't identify it from my picture  A lot of people told me  It looks like me  But most people said it doesn't  They were  When I was up in New Hampshire  They were just pulling blonde guys  Off the street  Who looked  You know  Were six foot tall  You would have been pulled over  Yeah  You know  I sure would have  And the reaction was a little bit crazy  Yeah  Because it  It wasn't a McDonald's shooting  It was  They knew what happened  People knew what was going on  Right  From day one  So what was the  What was the big deal? 
[02:22:00]  I mean, is that what the public  Needs to be  What was the big deal?  No, is that what the public  Needs to be protected from?  Uh-huh  You know  And that  Oh, a lot of people  Wanted to rally around you  And, you know  The majority  Until I opened my mouth  Yeah, and then you started talking  And then, well  Well, we all know what happens  When Bernie starts talking  Well, particularly if it's edited  The people turn against you  Pretty quickly  Well, if they edit out the worst  Particularly if they take things  If they only give part of a conversation  They take things out of context  Uh-huh  You know  One guy  Like we do, Opie  One guy who won an award 
[02:22:30]  All right  Thank you, Bernie  Bernie, that's all the time  Insightful  For that comment  I do have one question, though  It's about something that was said  Did you not  What did you say at a meeting one time  Of tenants or a co-op meeting  Or something that got  That got blown out of proportion  Yes, yes  Well, no  I did say some racial stuff  And I shouldn't have  It was cleaning out  Cleaning up a neighborhood  On 14th Street  There was a lot of sidewalk selling  This is before the incident, by the way  Yeah, this was about a year and a half  Before the incident  Oh  And I was a neighborhood activist 
[02:23:00]  And stuff  And we were  We would talk about  The main issue  At that time  Was causing a lot of trouble  For the street  There was sidewalk selling  Where the stores  Were putting  Would be leasing out sidewalk space  To independent  Supposedly independent vendors  Who, by the way  Would store their stuff  Often in the store  No, no, no  And they would sell  Crappy merchandise  Out on the street  Extend their merchandise  Out into the street  There were crowds around  And the store owners  Like that  The store owners  Like the bad parking  They like the street  Jammed up with parking 
[02:23:30]  They like it  Jammed up with people  And we had pickpockets  We had a lot of  Three-card Monty  Stuff like that  Ah, the good old days  Well, yeah  But  What kind of meeting  When you were at  Atkins meeting  This was a  This was a  One of  A number of community meetings  Where they wanted to  Do things to clean up the street  And we were focusing on  You know  How to get rid of  You know  Get rid of sidewalk selling  So what did you say  I used  Thanks, Jimmy  Yes  Wonderful  Thanks, Jimmy  Yes, and I used the N-word  You know  Oh, you did

All right  It's nothing like Jesse Jackson  All right  Spitting in somebody's sandwich  A white guy's sandwich  Or saying hymie town  Or hymie town, right?  The spitting in the sandwich 
[02:25:00]  Is worse than same hymie town  Well, yeah  All right, Bernie  Let's intro your next record  Why don't we do  God Shuffled His Feet?  That's kind of a cool song  The music isn't the greatest  But it's kind of  Kind of  A little critique  I'm not a Christian  But I think that  Modern Christian values  Are pretty good  Pretty good model  For mankind  For males in particular  And this is the  Crash Test Dummies, right?  Yeah  Oh  I didn't know  They had another hit  Then they do that  Yeah 
[02:25:30]  God Shuffled His Feet  Crash Test Dummies  Wait, wait  What are you doing?  Bernie's got to do that  Yeah  Trying to get a little energy  In his  Talk it up  In his program  He's a low-key guy  He's a night job  Low-energy program  After seven days 
[02:26:00]  He was quiet and tired  So God said  Let there be a day  Just for picnics  Some wine and bread  Gathered up  Some people he had made  Created blankets  And laid back in the shade  The people 
[02:26:30]  Sipped their wine  And what we've got there  They asked him  Questions  But do you have to eat  Or get your hair cut  In heaven  And if your eye  Got put down in his life  Would it be waiting up 
[02:27:00]  In heaven with your wife  God shall fall as heat  He stinks  And I don't like him  In heaven  The people  Clear their throat  Dog play  Boy Scalorny  And he was straight here  In heaven  In heaven  So he says

[02:28:00]  Or had  He got some stress  God  Shuffled his feet  Ah, there you have it  Crash test dummies  God shuffled his feet  Right, Bernie?  Well  Yeah, yeah  You know  There's a time  No, that wasn't  That's where your head is at 
[02:28:30]  But  You know  There's a time for shooting  But it's much harder  To win the peace  Than to win a war  Winning a war isn't easy  And that's a great accomplishment  But then  One should win the peace  Uh  What?  Yeah  Hello, exactly  I'm talking about life  I'm talking about  Being not  Love  Being friendly with the animals  Hello, exactly  And that applies  Women  That applies more to women than guys  You have something to say  Women  I have something to say  Alright, so let's just 
[02:29:00]  Let's just talk  Yeah, women are more into love  Than guys  Hello, exactly  Women love more  Love can be very important  Even to guys  But women love much more easily  Simple  Erhythmic  One, two, three  Um  Anyway  Yeah, anyway  And you see  So love  I'm sorry you guys  Didn't like that song  I liked it  It was good  It was  It was alright  You guys  They're not gonna shoot us  Or anything  We just don't like the song  I liked it, Opie  It's not like we're  You see  Yeah, yeah  That's what  You know  You just let it flow  That's one of the good things  I didn't really understand  Night radio, low pressure  Where you just play  Thank you 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, the lyrics were  Let the music do that  The lyrics were hard to understand  So  Takes away from the song  I believe  A little hard  But then you think about it  Like what if you woke up  With blue hair  And thought it was great  You know  And what if it turns out  It wasn't so great  Hello, exactly  God damn it  Are you fucking with me  No  No  That's unfortunate  You know  A lot of times  People think  If you're being honest with them  You're fucking with them  Because there's so much  Right  Cynicism  Particularly in New York  Oh, yes  Cold machine  Cold financial machine 
[02:30:00]  All right  I think we're ready  For the next Bernie Getz  Oh my goodness  I didn't have one  Uh oh  Okay  Just do crazy by seal  You guys can relate to that  Right  No  Crazy  Yeah  Didn't Patsy Cline sing that?  Patsy Cline's saying a lot about  No  She's  No  She's saying about  Yeah  Oh 
[02:30:30]  That's terrific  That's terrific  No  Patsy Cline  To me  That just amused me for a second  Patsy Cline is very different  But I mean  Her songs were intelligent  People listened to them  And they thought about them  Doesn't mean it was  You know  It was happy  But it was  There's a lot of realness there  It's  Whatever you guys want  You can put  You can do  You can do  It's My Life  Even though I know you don't like that  You can do Time Warp  You can do Crazy by seal  We can do some  Return to Ignomance

You could have a list of  Hundreds of good songs  And you like this song  Why?  It's different  Creative  Different point of view  A different point of view  About why?  He says not everybody  Not everybody can fly  And people  People should be  Actually no one can  No  No  No  Some  Some 
[02:31:30]  Some  Some  Some people  Some people  Can fly  And they should  They should  They should try  And give it out to others  What do you mean  Some people can fly, Bernie?  And the people  Who don't fly  The people who don't fly  A lot of those  They're looking for those  Who can fly  What do you mean by fly?  Are you speaking literally  Or figuratively?  Give direction  Give direction to this madness  In the world  Who can fly?  You know  They're like  I think there's  I think R. Kelly said it best  When he said  I believe I can fly  That's right  Well  Mankind can fly 
[02:32:00]  Mankind can excel  There's a guy  Who wants to do  But are we flying  Like are we flapping our wings  Or are we flying  You mean in an airplane?  To be better  To be  To make good  Out of the world  Mankind  Figuratively speaking  Mankind has power  We have power  We don't believe  What we take for granted  X-ray vision  We have the choice  We can choose  Life and death  For any other creature  In terms of winning battles  A war with every other species  Has been won long ago 
[02:32:30]  Except for the mollusk  Now we decide  Who lives and die  It's at the restaurant  With the power of our money  You know  Do you want it fried?  Do you want it  Whatever  Someone else does  God damn it  Are you fucking with me?  No  No  Giving you the straight point  Alright well  Okay  That was a good explanation  For this next song  By Bernie Getza  Bernie intro  Intro to the song  Here it is  Go  Just play it  Another cool song  Who is it?  Sam  And the song?  And the song? 
[02:33:00]  Oh crazy  There you go  What the hell are you talking about?  I see the awful  Terrible things  In my life  And turn it  Into something funny  A man decides 
[02:33:30]  A man decides after 70 years  That what he goes there for  Is to unlock the door  While those around me  Can't sleep in me  I throw you a fractal on that breaking wall  I see you my friend  And touch your face again  Miracles will happen as we trip 
[02:34:00]  But we're never gonna survive  Don't play boys  Got me a nigga with straight hair  No we're never gonna survive  No we're never gonna survive  But unless  We are a little  And we're from  Crazy  Crazy 
[02:34:30]  Yeah the people  Walking through my head  One of them's got a gun  Shoot the other one  Checked out mean ho  Together they were friends at school  Yeah  And the truth  Show sets you free 
[02:35:00]  Hey that's a nice little choice there Bernie  See you all crazy  Yeah yeah yeah  A little mellow  I'm detecting a like of some mellow music  Well he likes the pot Anthony  He likes the pot  Well yeah  You know they talk there about  The truth setting you free  There was a Fleetwood Mac album 
[02:35:30]  Where this gorilla is tasting some cake  Which represents knowledge  Bernie the gorilla has a name  And the gorilla's crying  Daryl  No no no  The gorilla's crying  And that's the first many tastes of knowledge  Are you know  Are sadness  And even  We haven't even gotten to grief  You know what scares me  Going back to Seal  Crazy  There's a lyric in that song  That says one man has a gun  He shot the other one  Yeah  Oh  Happens all the time  Yep  Obviously  Less than it used to 
[02:36:00]  Some people more often than others  Right  Yeah I think the New York City police  Should probably have  There should be an experimental program  With these things called tasers  They will knock someone on their butt  Yeah  What they need to do though  Those  They're too strong  They need to have like  Five adjustable settings on them  So for you  Adjust it from the lowest setting  All the way up to a max setting  One all the way up to kill  Well  And you could also burn through rocks and doors with it  Well kind of  You see  But if a guy  If there's a robbery going on  Or something heavy  A guy's a weapon  The cop has it on max  Boom  It'll knock anybody down 
[02:36:30]  On a lower setting  If there's  If he thinks there's going to be less trouble  And the cops could even test it on themselves first  So if you're standing on a mat  Because you will go down  That thing has more  Knock down power  We've seen that  Than a 45  Yes  Thank you Bernie  That was a very good thought  And listen to you  Communist and niggers and Jews  Tell all your buddies  To spread the news  Today  Judgment will soon be nigh  As the Lord in his wisdom  Looks down from on high  Will his battle be lost  By mixing the races

[02:42:30]  The Wow sticker stop  Brought to you by your pals  At the Opie and Anthony show  The Opie and Anthony show  XM 202  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program  The ONA virus spreading across America  Bernie gets absolutely out of his mind today  Like always  Yeah I know  He's kind of guest DJing  A couple more songs from Bernie 
[02:43:00]  And then we're going to move on to a few other things  Instant feedback  Bill from Waterford, New York  Okay where can I find the John and Jeff show  On the XM dial  It's got to be better than Bernie right now  George from Philly  I'm thinking you guys are going to owe me 7 cents for today  But I'm afraid to ask for it right now  Uh oh  Very good  Maybe we should change  If they don't like it  We can you know  Then so be it  No  We've never been one to uh  Stop doing something our listeners didn't like  Ask Bernie if he knows how Seal got those scars on his face 
[02:43:30]  And where did he hide the weapon  James from PA  When did Bernie turn into a new age faggot  Wow  Wow  Save the wave from Jersey  Tell Bernie to smoke some more pot  And maybe he'll get some musical discrimination  And uh  He's talking about loving the animals  But I guess that doesn't apply to gorillas  Progress is what  What's it all  Progress is what it should be about  What it's all about  You know it's good  Unless there's a killing tag 
[02:44:00]  That was really a racist and funny  Maniac  Alright Bernie  Okay  I like the songs he's playing though  Yeah I think it's time for another Bernie thought  Before we get into the next song  My mind is a blank  Why don't we just do  Here's Bon Jovi  It's my life  This ain't a song for the broken hearted  A silent prayer for faith departed 
[02:44:30]  And I ain't gonna keep to the place in the crowd  You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud  It's my life  It's now or never  But I ain't gonna live forever  I just wanna live when I'm alive 
[02:45:00]  I'm big dick black  I'm big dick black  All is like an open high  But they can say I did it my way  I just wanna live when I'm alive  You little scumbag  I got your name  I got your ass  Alright very good Bernie  Just a quick piece of that one  I think you should have chose  Shots of the Heart  Would have been a nice one 
[02:45:30]  From Bon Jovi  If you were thinking about it  Right  You know I'd have to  I haven't listened to these songs  For such a long time  I don't even  You don't even know what you're doing  We honestly thought you'd put some thought into what you're doing today  No your producer gave me a day and a half  And I didn't pick these things out until 6.30 this morning  I hadn't listened to them  That's how you smoked your three tokes right?  No  Was it a three toke day or a two toke day?  This was a one toke day  One toke day  One toke day  And yeah it's my coffee  Of course it's your coffee 
[02:46:00]  Todd what's up?  That guy fucking sucks  But anyway when you guys went on break  I turned to CNN  And they were saying  They were talking about how it's there  And how he went on vacation  And he lost four markets  And they were saying how you guys are standing in Syracuse  Really?  It made CNN now?  Yeah  As soon as you guys went on break  I turned to CNN  They said you guys are standing in Syracuse  Very interesting  Very interesting  Is there any way to confirm that?  Thanks man  Thank you Todd  Oh he means today 
[02:46:30]  You mean break today?  No when we went to break on our show  He went to CNN  And supposedly CNN had a little story  About how we replaced Howard in Syracuse  I just don't know when we went to break like last week  But it's just not bothering Howard though Anthony  It just doesn't bother him  Doesn't bother him  That we took over for him in Syracuse  And maybe taking over for him in other cities  In the very near future  But it doesn't bother him at all  Even though he's spending probably at this point  Over an hour talking about us  Yeah  But it doesn't bother him  You've got lots of listeners 
[02:47:00]  The last show I was on  The website that I plugged  It normally was getting 85 hits a day for a week  And then the 24 hours after your show  Was about 1,024  Oh there you go  So that was 900 people  And very few people who listen  Log on the internet  So there are lots of people out there  Bernie4mayor.com  Yeah let me plug my website  Bernie4mayor  That's all letters  People are complaining  They can barely hear Bernie  By the way  Okay Bernie4mayor  That's B-E-R-M-I-E  M-I-E 
[02:47:30]  F-O-R-M-A-Y-O-R  Wait  Bernie4  Bernie with an I-E right  Bernie  Yes  The letter for  Bernie  No no not the letter for  The F-O-R  All spelled out  Three words  Bernie4mayor  What if you're a dolphin  It would be  F-O-R-E  B-E-R-N-I-E  Wait  F-O-R-E  No F-O-R  M-A-Y-O-R  All right  B-E-R  Wait wait wait wait  You guys can't spell Bernie  Oh spell  Oh spell for  Instead of the letter for  No no no  Bernie number four 
[02:48:00]  F-O-U-R  No you guys are horrible  Instead of doing the letter for  Oh these guys should be  I think it's  F-O-R right  No just google Bernie gets  You'll see Bernie for mayor  Is it F?  Just google Bernie  So it's for Bernie mayor  No just google the name Bernie  Wait no  We want the website  Bernie  If they go  Bernie  That's B-E-R-N-I-E  Bernie  P-H-O-R  Then the word  F-O-R  M-A-Y-O-R 
[02:48:30]  You guys are even getting me mixed up  Man  Just google Bernie  Bernie is mayor dot com  It is Bernie the mayor  And if I were mayor  Pot would  I couldn't legalize it  But I'd do a lot of changes  But we'd all be smoking a lot of pot right  Pot would  The laws on pot would be relaxed  If the police commissioner would go along with it  I believe in doing all drugs  You know but I  Making them legal in effect  But the most responsible people say 
[02:49:00]  Alright thank you Bernie  Just legalize pot first  That was a wonderful thought there  Legalize pot first  Let's go to Chuck on Long Island real fast  Chuck go ahead  Yo  Bernie gets  You listen to these songs as a child  It goes like this  It goes  The niggers on the bus  Go up and down  Up and down  Up and down  The niggers on the bus  Go up and down  All through the hood  Jesus  Okay  Okay  Oh my  What a guy 
[02:49:30]  Yeah  Okay  Chuck the lunatic  Get him off your radio  He's fantastic  Yeah Bernie  We love Bernie  Bernie you guys  Bernie you were laughing at that one  A little too hard  Well yes but  No look  It's  Look it's a song  It was  It was  It was funny  But  Alright let's say hi to Greg  Greg what do you have today  Greg  Hi I'd like to request a Aerosmith song  Alright  Which one  Do you have Bernie's got a gun  No  I don't think Aerosmith ever wrote a song  Why don't we do time work by the Rocky Horror Picture Show 
[02:50:00]  Alright but before we just play it because that's kind of boring  We want a Bernie thought or a reason you like this song or  You know something  Different creative  I think people wearing suits and ties and stuff like that  I understand why they do it  But mankind needs to change  And even the people who are just faceless bureaucrats  They want change in the world  They may not be able to do it  But they look to others to do it  Guys like you have a lot of say  Time warp  Yeah 
[02:50:30]  Time warp  Suits and ties  The whole Rocky Horror Picture Show is very non-conformist  Well yeah  Gotta agree with him there  Do you think Frank  Tim Curry was kind of hot  I remember the name Tim Curry  I don't even remember  Frank Inferter  The tranny character  Oh that guy  That guy  Slightly  Well  You know  Whatever  Yeah just a little bit hot  Just a little right  Well  You're like a guy that wears panties 
[02:51:00]  The  The  I think the show was very live and let live  The whole concept  You know in Roman times  Bisexuality was considered normal  And a lot of  People today are uptight about sex  Oh you're a big tough cunt  You faggot ain't you  Taboo and stuff  Bernie are you a faggot  No but I believe in live and let live  So are you  Just if it doesn't hurt do it  You know whatever people want to do 
[02:51:30]  You friggin fag  You want to make out or something  Life is not as hard as that  I mean it can be for some people  You know a lot of people  People can make life cold and miserable  What do you consider yourself bisexual  Well I don't really discuss my sex life  Or lack of my sex life  Well we got some good news and some bad news for you  You know how you wanted a hooker  Promise  Oh wow  What  Next time  Remember you said you wanted a hooker  Yeah  And you know  Ant and I could get you a hooker  The problem  Wow  Cheekers  If I get elected mayor  You'll definitely get me a hooker though 
[02:52:00]  I think you're lying to me  Cheekers  We wouldn't lie  But if I get elected mayor  Then you're really  The good news is we have a hooker for you  The bad news is she's black  Well if she's cute  Brady doesn't care  No  Well I think there's two different things  You should have shot into that one  No sex  Sex is for two things  Enjoyment and having children  Like you know having children in life  That's one of maybe five important things in life  You know one is taking care of yourself 
[02:52:30]  Taking care of material things  Two  One is having children  Great  You know but  That's all  They're separate  All right  Ranting we have time for  Why don't you intro Time Warp then  Yeah  Here's Time Warp  From the Rocky Horror Picture Show  It's astounding  Time is fleeting  Madness  Takes its toll 
[02:53:00]  But listen closely  Not for very much longer  I've got to  Keep control  I hear you  I remember  Doing the Time War  Drinking  Those moments win  Come on lick me  I wanna lick  And the boys will be calling  Those men  Want to have sex with me 
[02:53:30]  Let's do the Time Warp then  Let's do the Time Warp then  It's just a jump  To the left  Uh-huh  I knew it  They turned you into pookers  With your hands on your hip  It looks like we might have to lose  Oh yeah?  Well I'm gonna give you  A  What? 
[02:54:00]  I just gave A  Let's do the Time Warp then  He had a time gate  He had a time gate  It's a dream  Oh fantasy free me  So you can't see me  No not at all  You're a little bitch  In another dimension  I saw I hear a bitch  And I bet you'd like to suck it  With voyeuristic intention  Well secluded  I see all  With a visible mind flip 
[02:54:30]  You're into the Time Slip  And nothing  Can ever be the same  You're such a start of sensation  Like you're under sedation  Let's do the Time Warp again  Let's do the Time Warp again  Alright  It says to  It says to jump to the left 
[02:55:00]  Unless you're paralyzed  The feedback is wonderful today Anthony  Frankie from Boughkeepsie  I'm complaining that I can hear him  And Jim from PA  Come on guys  This sucks  I'm getting ready to ask myself  For five bucks  The truth hurts  Yep  They don't like to hear the truth  Bunch of critics  Bernie from mayor.com folks  Yeah  Phones are going nuts here Bernie  Let's say hi to Steve in Philly  Steve go ahead  Yo man 
[02:55:30]  Bernie what's up  Hello  You're on the show right  Yeah  And you don't shut the fuck up  I just say what I believe  And you introduce the song  You say three words  Right  Less of me more of the song  Well no  It was supposed to be about  You talking about the music  But you had these babbling thoughts  And then all of a sudden  Hey here's  And you know what else I don't like  A lot of times on the radio  Sometimes people try to end the song  Real good  And they cut it out  On the radio  And I think  Let the music  You know  Let it play out 
[02:56:00]  Yeah let it play  Well who's doing that  Well they should  More people should  And you're not a big fan  Of talking over the beginning  Of the song either  Let the song do the talking  All right  Rich from Long Island  Hi sweet tits  Hi  How are you Rich  Thanks for calling the program  I want to make sure  I wrote down  Bernie's website correctly  Is it  B-W  The number  E  Okay  No  Of course not  No  He was doing a Tyson impression 
[02:56:30]  Next one  You know it's ironic  That his website  Is Bernie for Mayor  And mine is  Eatabullet.com  Oh see  I bet you would love  That website name  Eatabullet.com  No wouldn't want it  That's mine  Wouldn't want it huh  Nope  Pete from Jersey  Not to sale folks  Hey what's going on gentlemen  Hey  Hey I just wanted to know  If Bernie's going to be  In the new James Bond movie  Next year  Nope  Cold nigger  Nope  Oh wow  What type of talk  Is that for the radio  Bernie I'm really sorry  I didn't know  That was going to happen  That's okay  I think we have time  For one more song  Oh 
[02:57:00]  One more song  One more  Only we'll open  But there's over an hour  Of show left  Trust me  We only have time  For one more song  Yeah  Why don't we do  Unfortunately I would love  To have Bernie on  For another hour  Yeah yeah yeah  You'd love to get me  Out of here  They hate me  No  Screw them  That's what we say  How about some of  The song Cuts You Up  By Peter Murphy  Or most of that  That's a song about  That's about the song  You can make mistakes  Cuts you up  I think if OJ came in  To guest DJ  He'd play that one  Yeah don't do mistakes  Deliberately  You know  Don't  Don't 
[02:57:30]  Don't  Don't  Don't be mean  Deliberately  If you're mean  You know  Don't be mean  If you know about it  People do mean things  Without knowing about it  Like if you buy  A piece of meat  In the supermarket  You don't really know  You're doing bad  But in fact  That's bad  If you buy a piece  Of meat in the supermarket  Probably a living creature  Suffered as a result  Of what you're doing  Yeah  Yeah well  Well there's a lot  Of living creatures  Suffering right now  Because they don't  Have these pieces  Of meat  As they listen  To what you have  To say Bernie  So what are you  Trying to say here  People are shoving  Hamburger meat  In their chairs  What I'm trying to say  Is try to do 
[02:58:00]  The right thing  And if mankind  Stops being a carnivore  You guys  Plus  Are carnivores  We have these  Meat teeth  Uh uh  It turns out  That the  How carnivorous  An animal  Is  Is  Is simply  In proportion  To the  Inverse  Of its  Intestinal length  Meaning  The longer  Your intestine  The more  Vegetables  You can eat  Now they say  For example  A dog  Is 50%  To twice as  Carnivorous  As a man  Because it has  A much shorter  Intestine 
[02:58:30]  So therefore  Eats more meat  A cat  Is even 50%  More carnivorous  Than a dog  Because a cat  Has a very short  Intestine  So that would be  100% more carnivorous  Than a man  A cat is much  More carnivorous  Than a man  100%  If a dog  Is 50  And a cat  50 more  Than a dog  It would be  100%  More than a man  Or a cat  Is two and a half  Times  Something like that  And cats are aliens  So people can  Probably thrive  People can thrive  Being vegetarian  Actually and they  Would live longer  And vitamins  You can always  Just take vitamins  As Ben would say  Well if anyone's 
[02:59:00]  Going to play around  With vegetarianism  They should definitely  Try vitamins  Yeah  Vitamins and supplements  Bernie  Cats  Aliens or what  Well aliens  May be here already  You know  I don't disagree  I believe they're  In the form of  Cats and Asian people  Who knows what form  They would take  Very deep  Very deep  It would be  Interesting  Very interesting  Alright this is the  Grand finale of  The Bernie Getz Hour  Why not  Yeah  Why don't you play  Half of Cuts You Up  By Peter Murphy  Why only half 
[02:59:30]  The song towards  You know  The last minute  Of song goes downhill  Why does it go downhill  It's not very good  Musical  He just starts repeating  A lot of songs  Do that  I think editing  The songs  Is real important  That they should  Edit  You know  Edit  And editing  Of a radio show  Is very important  I know  That's something  We haven't learned yet  I'm getting thrown at  You'd have taken  The second half  Of the song  Maybe  And buried it up  In Vermont  Yeah  Exactly  I gotcha  That sounds reasonable  Never to surface again  I would love to find that gun  Oh so would I  God would imagine 
[03:00:00]  Having that gun  Dude  How about the first person  That's broken up in pieces  But you see  That would be a valuable gun  It would be  It's a piece of history  I know  I didn't  I didn't  I didn't look at it  That way  I looked at it  We could have  Weekend with Bernie  Weekend with Bernie  Looking for his gun  Looking for your gun  We could drag a  What do you say  Well if there were money  In it  I don't see the point  Maybe it was  What town is it in  Yeah you have to remember  There's  If you go north of Bennington  There's a little place  Called Weston, Vermont  Weston, Vermont 
[03:00:30]  And it was just a little bit  It's across some bridge  From Weston  Across a bridge  From Weston  What direction from Weston  North?  South?  Well I'm guessing  It's just a little bit east  And then there was a  Little bit east  There was a bridge  And there was a  I actually went up there  With a guy  A few years ago  A guy from Boston  Really wanted to find it  And we came to the  General area  And there was a dump  That I was using  As a landmark  And I said  I'm sure there was  A dump here  And I turned on this road  And they said  But there's no 
[03:01:00]  There was absolutely  Nothing there  And then we started  Asking around the neighborhood  And they said  Oh yeah there was a dump there  That hasn't been there  For five years  And so I  Pretty well got the spot  But I  Did you have a metal  Detector with you?  No but I kind of  Concluded that  That  Basically  God  If there is a God  Wanted the gun  Not to be found  Just let it lie  Let it lie  Speaking of God  Bernie  Kevin from  Middlesex, New Jersey  Writes  Ask Bernie if the tsunami  Was God's real way  Of cleaning the stink  Off the savages 
[03:01:30]  In southern Asia  Oh  Ooh  That is  Well that did  That  Yeah  Something to think about  Do you think there were  Any cosmic  Reasons  For the tsunami?  Do you think that  I  I  Would  You know  Hate to call it  But a lot  A lot of people  Got washed out to sea  Yeah  Do you think maybe  That was  You know  There was a reason  For that  In the big picture  Of things  Like maybe they  They were asking for it  In certain ways  I hate to call that one 
[03:02:00]  I hate to call that one  Well just an opinion  You know  Just a good thought  We all have them  Yeah it's not like  You have to shoot  I mean you know  If you can extrapolate  You can say  The World Trade Center  You can say  Maybe there was  A lot of evil  Well people have said that  And maybe  Ah  And you see  Well should people  Feel comfortable  With the status quo  Should New York  Have felt comfortable  With all this dishonesty  Alright  That was very good Bernie  So with that  The final song  And the  Bernie gets  Just DJ out  Right  It's  Well you intro it there Bernie 
[03:02:30]  Oh sure  Peter Murphy  It cuts you up  Yeah sure it does  Okay  Let's  Ha  Oh yeah  We'll be right back. 
[03:03:00]  We'll be right back. 
[03:03:30]  It's pit you out when you desire to conquer it, to feel your high.  To follow it, you must be clean with mistakes that you do mean.  Move the heart, switch the pace.  Look for what seems out of place. 
[03:04:00]  Move the heart, switch the pace. 
[03:04:30]  On and on it goes, call it like a distant wind.  Through the zero I will walk, because the fear can break the thin.  No sound break, no moment clear, when all the doubts are crystal clear.  The fear, crashing hard into the secret wind.  You know the way it twists and turns, changing colors, spinning yarns. 
[03:05:00]  You know the way it leaves you dry.  It cuts you off and takes you high.  You know the way it's painted gold.  Is it honey?  Is it cold?  You know the way it goes about.  It takes you in and speaks you out.  Wow.  Bernie wanted us to fade this out, Anthony.  That's where it gets bad, huh, Bernie? 
[03:05:30]  Yeah, it goes down a little bit.  It goes down a little bit from that point.  Kind of like the mellower part of that song.  Yeah.  Anyway, thank you, guys.  This has been good.  You see, I know a lot of people out there maybe didn't like it.  I feel good about it.  I think it was good radio.  You know what?  Screw them.  Bernie, we do something called the O&A Variety Hour.  It runs at 5 a.m. on the East Coast.  And we would be honored if maybe you programmed an hour of that for us.  Where it would just be you?  Yeah, just you and Steve in the production room, 
[03:06:00]  and you actually programmed the whole hour with your music  and you intro on the music and saying how Opie and Anthony are on the way.  And it's recorded.  And it's recorded.  And the whole song plays.  The whole song will play.  We won't even be around, Bernie.  You passed the audition.  Promises?  You passed the audition.  Yes.  Promises.  Yes.  When can you come in and tape that?  And then we'll play it on a future Variety Hour.  I'm kind of busy for the next couple weeks.  I'm on some electronic projects.  Can you give me at least a couple weeks?  No, I don't think so.  Electronic projects, huh? 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I kind of excel in electronics.  That's what we've heard.  I'm not ashamed to use that word.  Why aren't you going to Vegas for the Cumber Electronics show?  There's a big convention out there this week.  It costs some money.  I'd like to see some of that stuff.  I make the world's best intermediate-sized levitator.  You know?  And, yeah, electromagnetic levitator.  Is that what David Blaine uses?  It suspends things in the air, but I make the best part.  Do they have to be able to be magnetized in order to levitate? 
[03:07:00]  You have to attach a magnet to it, or this one will levitate any iron object.  Any iron object.  Right.  Can you bring in some of your experiments?  I could bring in the levitator.  The last time I was showing it off, it broke.  I could fix it.  I could bring it in.  I wasn't planning on getting around to fixing the...  How big is it?  Well, it stands about three feet tall.  It weighs about...  This one...  This particular one, it's just a test model, weighs about 50 pounds, and it's as big as  a suitcase. 
[03:07:30]  It's meant to sit on a table, though.  Like, it could sit right on one of these cameras easily.  And we can lift stuff with it?  All kinds of stuff, yeah.  Really?  Suspended in the air, right.  Can you levitate yourself out of the studio?  I'm going to do it in about 20 seconds.  Bernie, what else have you...  And then I'll be gone.  What else have you made?  Because that's kind of cool.  What else have you made that you would consider pretty cool?  Pretty cool?  Levitator's pretty cool.  Well, yeah.  Yeah, Levitator's pretty cool in terms of, you mean, creating mechanical devices. 
[03:08:00]  In terms of doing good in the world, you can create with life.  If you can make people better, if you can make buildings better, those are good things.  Those are good things.  In terms of what I try to do to make things better is to promote vegetarianism.  I know that sounds corny, too.  Of course.  Here it goes.  99% of the people out there...  Corny.  Uh-huh.  Well...  When I talk, it sounds beefy.  Well, right.  Because, you know, I'm not a...  Well...  But it's right.  Someday, it'll be the future.  I like how you can levitate iron things, or you can propel lead things into black people. 
[03:08:30]  That's like two inventions.  Well, I can propel it into anybody.  Well, that's true.  I'm just going on past performance, that's all, Bernie.  Just past performance.  Well, what do you have to do?  You know, you have to shoot a white guy publicly in order to get rid of the racial...  Well, give it a try.  One of the hurtful things about the case...  The case originally was not presented as racial, but you had some of my political opposition... 
[03:09:00]  Uh-huh.  ...because they had nothing.  Oh, right.  That was very good.  That was very good.  When are we going to get you a chick?  It hurt a lot of black people.  Yeah, we got to get Bernie a chick.  We got to get...  Anyway...  New York Confidential is hot shit.  Get a couple of girls here.  We'll hook you up.  You need some female companionship.  Well, whatever.  Well, whatever.  No, we're going to get you a hooker, and you're going to come in with some of your experiments,  all right?  Promise?  Oh, yeah, we will actually.  We'll get you one.  We're not even kidding, Bernie.  Promises.  Sooner than later.  Uh-oh.  Kevin in Jersey, real fast.  Go ahead.  For Bernie Getz.  I heard Bernie was working on a subway electric chair for the Harlem line. 
[03:09:30]  Are you working on an electric chair for the subways?  Better known as the D-train?  No, no, no.  A lot of times, individuals are better than the state in doing capital punishment.  Of course, Bernie, whatever that means.  All right, listen.  It's been fun.  Okay.  I found something, though, Bernie.  I want to play into break.  Anthony and I have been fans of yours for quite a long time.  Yes, yes.  And I found an old bit we did.  This is years ago.  Remember when you lost your squirrel and it became a...  That was the worst thing in my life. 
[03:10:00]  Oh.  Yep.  It's the worst thing in your life, and here we were at that time making light of it because  we didn't know you.  If we knew you, of course, we'd be a little more sympathetic.  Why was it the worst thing in your life to lose a squirrel?  Okay.  There are many emotions that people have.  You're not going to cry, are you, Bernie?  No.  You can have fear.  You can have anger.  You can have love.  You can have grief.  You can have deep depression.  Now, in order to have grief, you need love first.  And love is a rare thing, particularly for males.  Women love more easily than males, but for a male to love is a special thing, and I lost 
[03:10:30]  a creature, one of the rare creatures that I loved.  She could do primitive speech, by the way.  She could say the word, stop.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Bernie, you've never ceased to amaze me or surprise us.  You are saying your squirrel was talking.  Well, said the word, stop.  Many people had seen...  I used to walk around in the park with her on me and stuff.  Maybe you should have been molesting your squirrel.  By the way, all the...  Your squirrel's yelling, stop.  No.  She learned it on her own.  All little rodents can hiss. 
[03:11:00]  Right.  And I've had many rodents, when you treat them a little rough, this and that, or they're  unhappy, they'll hiss at you.  They're not listening to you.  And I used to shout at her when she was doing things, stop, stop, stop.  And one day, she couldn't say the P.  They couldn't pronounce the P.  Can't get those little squirrel lips over those huge squirrel teeth.  Stop.  I'm sorry.  I'm listening to Voss talk.  I'm going to tell you...  Did she say Worcester, Massachusetts?  I'm going to tell you in Squirrel Talk what she said.  She said, stop, stop.  Wow.  Really? 
[03:11:30]  And that was mimicking my stop.  You know, I had a dog once, and I swear to God, it could say roof.  No.  Whoa.  Oh, yeah.  Stop.  Oh, yeah.  I swear.  But animals do convey things.  Like, for example, if they growl and you're, that means go away.  Really?  Er means go away.  What does growl mean?  Growl or go away.  Like, for example, if you had a pet animal, it doesn't necessarily mean it wants to attack 
[03:12:00]  you.  Er.  So...  So...  It means go away.  Like, if it's sleeping or something.  Er.  Right.  Right.  So, you were in love with the squirrel.  Oh, yes.  We loved it.  That talked to you.  Oh, well...  You squirrel ran away?  Not only did I love the squirrel, the squirrel loved me.  And as the song says, you know...  Then why did it run away?  One of the greatest things in life was to love and be loved in return.  That was my fault.  I pushed her too hard. 
[03:12:30]  I walked around with her in the farmer's...  What, you started using the thumb?  No, in the farmer's market, which was...  I should have just restricted myself to Union Square Park, because Union Square Park is  safe.  But I walked in the farmer's market.  She couldn't take the crowd.  She panicked and ran, and that was it.  Did you have it on a leash or something?  Like, gorephobic squirrel.  It just followed you?  It would usually hang on me, yes.  Sure, sure.  Did you panic when she ran away?  I was very scared.  I tried to catch her, but she ran underneath the vehicle. 
[03:13:00]  And I didn't realize at the time, I found out later, that when vehicles move, when a  squirrel will...  Most animals will run out of a vehicle.  A squirrel will usually stay in the vehicle.  She probably climbed up in one of the trucks at the farmer's market.  I was there until 6 o'clock.  And went out to the country somewhere.  Yes.  And got her lift out to the country and went and met some other squirrels.  No.  And had a...  No, this was a tame squirrel.  This animal would have died probably in, you know, a cruel death, a very fearful death. 
[03:13:30]  She would have died within a month.  And I was just grief-stricken.  For how long?  Well, it still hurts me now.  But you can't...  You don't let it...  You don't let it destroy you.  You become more familiar with death.  You have another squirrel now, right?  And at the office, I have a nice little squirrel, but he does not match her.  Do you catch them wild?  Don't they bite you?  Well...  He shoots them when they bite them.  No, no. 
[03:14:00]  Well, I get very angry when they bite me.  Yeah.  The squirrel that I have at the office now, for example, he bit me only about 10 days ago  for the first time.  So what I did is, I took him out and I put him in Union Square Park in the afternoon.  And then I came back...  He climbed up a tree.  And I came back several times for him.  And then I went back when it was 6 o'clock when it was dark.  And I went back at 10 after 9.  And he was there on the ground.  And I just picked him up and took him out of there.  So you kind of gave him a timeout, a squirrel timeout in the park.  And he's been much nicer since then, because the other squirrels chased him out of the 
[03:14:30]  tree.  Aww.  Sure.  And he was...  It puts the lotion on its skin.  It does this whenever it's told.  Precious.  Put the fucking squirrel in the basket, lady.  No, they say sometimes...  I didn't like disciplining the squirrel.  But some people say, you know, spare the rod, spoil the child.  I put him out there for a few hours.  Spare the rod, spoil the squirrel.  Do you know how bad that must have been for that squirrel, though?  I'm sure four maybe darker furred squirrels came up to it.  They're all great.  Tried to ask it for five nuts. 
[03:15:00]  No, they're all...  Right.  And it didn't have a gun on it.  Oh, no.  I'm sure that was very scary for the squirrel.  Probably was.  He wasn't crying or anything when I took him back.  But he is better behaved.  As a matter of fact, he rested a lot.  He's much more subdued.  And he's actually been much more friendly and gentle and affectionate since then.  Do you...  Really?  Do you let the squirrel smoke some pot with you?  No, never have.  Maybe some...  There's no need to.  I could possibly blow a little pot in its face.  In its little squirrel face?  It never seemed appropriate.  With some animals, it might be appropriate. 
[03:15:30]  All right.  Let's go to the phones real fast.  Rob, go ahead.  Your tail still looks fluffy.  Hey, I was wondering what those parents had when you shot them there, Bert.  They didn't say anything.  Once the shots were fired, they said nothing.  Yeah, they said nothing.  All right.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, I once had a dog named Chester that could talk, and he'd say, don't kick me.  Oh!  Dog named Chester, huh?  I have no idea what that guy's saying.  Wow.  Yukon, the trucker.  Yes, Yukon?  Hey, I had a dog once.  His name was Chester, and he used to say, ouch, my liver. 
[03:16:00]  All right.  Ah, Bernie.  Way to repeat it, stupid.  I know.  Caller 1 says something.  Caller 2 just chimes in with it.  Okay.  Am I getting that here now?  Oh, wait a lot.  No, actually, we have that thing.  Yeah.  So you lost your pet squirrel that you love that talked to you, and it became a huge media  story in New York.  Did the press try to talk to you about that?  Yes, and I had a telephone number.  When you make your number public, there were a bunch of crank calls, but I was surprised. 
[03:16:30]  I got about half a dozen calls from maybe the most compassionate, understanding, intelligent  people that you can imagine in the city.  All right, Bernie, did your squirrel have 10-pound balls?  No.  Yeah, well, how did he walk?  Ha, ha, ha.  All right, Bernie, do you have Prince Squirrel in a can?  Oh, you better let him out.  Ha, ha, ha.  No, it was a female squirrel.  Uh, butt plug in a squirrel?  No.  No.  Butt plug.  No, and, as a matter of fact, what is good to know, a small percentage of people in this 
[03:17:00]  town are the finest people you would ever want to know, and the most compassionate.  Yeah.  Most of it is pretty cold.  All right.  Hello, I think I found a squirrel.  Is it yours?  It's yelling stop all the time.  I can't stand it.  I can't see him too well because I don't have my glasses.  Well, the squirrels are, squirrels are important to me.  A lot of, life, people should value squirrels in life more.  I think everyone likes squirrels. 
[03:17:30]  You know, Google, can you Google Bernie's name and find the squirrel story for later?  How long did you have the squirrel for?  That squirrel I only had about 10 and a half months, I think.  Yeah, okay.  That was a long time.  So, we're trying to get out of this segment.  And so, basically, yeah, you lost the squirrel, the media jumped on it, and there was a couple  articles written about it.  I never got it back.  And the weird thing is, it was at the same time that poor JFK Jr. went down.  In his airplane.  In the airplane.  Yeah.  And they had that.  The search was on for JFK Jr. in the Long Island Sound, if you remember. 
[03:18:00]  And they never did autopsies on those bodies.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Makes you think.  And they never did an autopsy on Mary Jo Kopeck, or they did, and the grand jury wasn't  allowed to see it.  Thank you, Bernie.  That's true.  Very true.  So, it was two stories going on at the same time.  And it was just odd that, you know, people were asking how they could help to find the  squirrel when there were ships and planes and everyone looking for JFK Jr., but really  no one looking for your squirrel, and it was a little disheartening to us.  So, we kind of threw this together, Bernie. 
[03:18:30]  What the hell?  We interrupt this program to bring you a special bulletin.  I'm Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  We continue coverage now of the search for Bernie Getz Squirrel.  Obviously, a very distraught Bernie Getz Squirrel's been missing since early Friday morning.  The search continuing as the Navy ship, The Grasp, looks at the waters for Bernie's squirrel. 
[03:19:00]  We're not sure if this was a flying squirrel, but they are looking for wreckage.  We will speak later with a very distraught Bullwinkle who will give some insight on the life and  times of Bernie Getz's squirrel.  Of course, this squirrel coming from a family plagued by tragedy over the years.  You may remember this squirrel's father shot in the head in the park by a little kid with 
[03:19:30]  a BB gun.  That horrible, horrible episode caught on videotape where you see his head go back into the left.  And the mommy squirrel, covered with brains, bravely goes on.  Here you're seeing footage now of Bernie's squirrel, very young, saluting that older squirrel.  The search now continuing, our helicopters circling above, looking for Bernie's squirrel. 
[03:20:00]  The family, of course, consoling themselves at the squirrel compound.  We cannot find the squirrel.  And boy, the teeth look a lot like the Kennedy family's teeth.  Don't they have those big, big choppers they have?  Of course, Bill Clinton saying, giving all resources to find the squirrel a treasure to  Bernie Gale.  Um, Tom?  Uh?  You sound a little woozy once again today. 
[03:20:30]  A little groggy, yeah.  Well, I was out looking for the squirrel myself and another squirrel was in a tree and threw  a big, big nut down on my head.  It hit just right on my temple.  I'm a bit groggy.  Tom Brokaw, MDC Nightly News.  Of course, tragic loss.  Everybody leaving flowers and nuts at the Getz house as a tribute.  As time runs out, I've had the Coast Guard on the phone and they are saying this is now 
[03:21:00]  a search for victims and no longer a rescue.  I just want to let you know that.  The search costing millions of dollars now.  The squirrel did not file a flight plan.  We have talked with other squirrels who said they would not have even climbed a tree in  the haze of Friday morning.  Very difficult.  Bernie's squirrel missing now for quite a few days as hope runs out at the squirrel compound. 
[03:21:30]  You see, the patriarch of the squirrel family, that big, fat one, you might remember, made  the news years back as he came crawling out of a river after a female squirrel that was  accompanying him drowned under mysterious circumstances.  But the search continuing.  We will keep breaking into your programming.  The search for Bernie Guess' Squirrel. 
[03:22:00]  Squirrel Jr.  On this NBC Nightly News.  Still broadcasting from Yellowstone National Park, of course.  Looking for the picnic basket scandal that has plagued Yogi Bear, as Ranger Smith is always  trying to turn him and blame him for a picnic basket.  Tom Broghoff.  NBC Nightly News. 
[03:22:30]  This just in, the body of Bernie Guess' Squirrel has been found.  It's a tragic day.  We will be going to the squirrel compound and getting a reaction from the squirrel family.  Tom Broghoff, NBC Nightly News, will be tying up traffic and interrupting your favorite  programs to bring in continuous coverage of a lost and now dead rodent.  Well, I think that people should value squirrels more and other animals. 
[03:23:00]  Bernie, but you see, we go way back with you.  I know.  That was our obsession with you.  If you saw a squirrel on an iceberg, and the iceberg's melting, what is more important?  The iceberg or the squirrel?  It's a tough one, actually.  The squirrel is more complicated than a star out there.  People don't value life now.  Throw it away.  Make them in a, what is it, a hundred chinchillas to make one fur coat.  Not enough chinchillas.  Iceberg.  Damn it, I knew it was squirrel. 
[03:23:30]  Squirrel.  Oh.  Okay, guys, it's been good.  Squirrel.  It's been good.  Yeah.  All right, good job.  By the way, the little squirrel saluting was just brilliant.  That was such a good...  Little claws up to his little furry head.  Little half shorts showing off those three-year-old boy legs.  Mommy squirrel pushes him forward a little bit.  Yes, they have...  Looking for the rich oil baron to now take care of the little squirrel.  They have minds just like us.  Just like us.  Well, Bernie, we'll continue the saga that is your life. 
[03:24:00]  Next time you come in, we're going to look at some of your experiments, right?  I would love to have you bring some of your electronics in.  I'm going to have to fix it.  Hopefully, the next time you're here, we'll have some hookers for you to choose from.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  Now, I know I'm coming.  I don't even have to get elected mayor.  Bernie gets super genius bringing in his experiment.  I like the way that sounds.  No, no, but I'll tell you what.  In terms of intelligence, no.  Bernie gets super genius.  No.  No. 
[03:24:30]  Anthony, let me tell you what's smart about it.  Occasionally, I go to lectures at Colombian stuff.  I wasn't good enough to get in Colombia.  Intellectually, I'm probably in the top 1%.  The really smart people, though, are the one in 1,000, one in the 10,000.  I'm not in that group.  Missed out.  See, I went to NYU.  You know what they say about NYU?  It's for the kids who couldn't get in Colombia, but their parents could afford Colombia kind of tuition.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  No.  It's that person.  Yeah. 
[03:25:00]  Really?  Yeah.  That's terrific.  That's good.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  All right, Bernie.  As Sergeant Joe Friday says, just the facts.  Right.  And then you come in next time.  You bring some of your electronics, maybe.  Some music or whatever.  We set you up with a female companionship, perhaps.  Well, whatever.  Okay.  And we'll talk about this music thing, too, or I'll talk with you guys.  Yeah, talk to Ben.  Ben doesn't have much to do today.  We'll put a show together.  I'm sure he would like to hear from you, okay?  Who listens at five?  Some people do.  I listen to five. 
[03:25:30]  Oh, believe it or not.  It gets replayed, too.  A lot of people.  It gets replayed.  You'll get a nice audience.  I think there could be money in it.  Okay.  There you go.  Thank you, Bernie.  Good work.  Sure.  Bye.  All right.  There he goes, Bernie Getz.  Bernie Getz is a subway vigilante.  Bernie, a couple of people want to take pictures with you, too, of course.  Big celebrity here in New York.  All right.  There he goes, Bernie.  Bernie.  There he goes, Bernie Getz.  Bernie, putting your coat on.  Bernie.  How are you, man?  All right.  Meeting.  Meet and greet over there on the lesbian couch.  I see that, Anthony.  Pictures being taken and autographs.  Bernie's a New York personality. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah.  He looks just like a flight instructor I used to have.  Really?  You remember him.  You didn't ever flight instruct people, did you?  Joe, I wouldn't bend over in front of Bernie like that.  He's asking for, you know, maybe a hooker or something.  Give you one shot to the colon.  In Mexico, there's places where people fly above the clouds, right?  Yeah.  Of course, yes.  We've heard of those people.  They don't need an airplane.  That's true.  All right.  All right.  Bernie, yeah.  Joe, you want to take a picture? 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  You think what?  Don't know if he's going to take off.  He dropped something.  Oh, you nailed him so bad.  All right.  He's still looking.  Oh, wow.  I enjoy that.  It was great.  I love the Bernie Getz.  Let me get something new out of him.  That's great.  He's got a squirrel that talks.  Dude, the talking squirrel.  Come on.  That's classic.  There's your seven cents for today, I'm thinking.  Ah!  This is Bernie Getz.  Man, you better give me a 20 or something.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.

[03:31:00]  In Anthony, XM202.  Head like a hole, black as your soul.  I'd rather die to give you control.  Head like a hole, black as your soul.  I'd rather die to give you control.  Bow down before the one you serve.  You're going to get what you deserve. 
[03:31:30]  What, you're pulling me off the air?  Then they did a stunt where they replaced us with Opie and Anthony while we were, you know, like their best of show.  And I go, why would I care?  You can replace me with whatever you want.  Yeah, that's what we're playing right now.  That's not even, doesn't come close.  Yeah, I mean, yeah, I go, why would that even offend me?  The only thing you're going to offend is a bunch of church-going people who are upset about how they got pulled off the air.  I said, this doesn't get to me.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't even know why you're involved with me like this. 
[03:32:00]  They think I give a crap about Opie and Anthony or Man Cow or any of these guys.  I don't care.  Put them all on.  You know, I just don't.  Put them all on.  I mean, I've seen what they can do.  Fareed thinks he's going to put, like, Opie and Anthony on.  And I'm going to get all upset about it.  And that's going to make me somehow twist in the wind.  And I don't care.  I honestly don't care.  There's 20 more minutes of that.  Where that came from.  You know what's amazing?  You just don't care, huh, Howard? 
[03:32:30]  Shut the fuck up.  The more someone says they don't care, you can guarantee they care.  You know who I don't care about?  Don and Mike.  All right.  I don't care about Man Cow.  Right.  I don't care about Tom Likas.  There you go.  And you talk about the people you care about, you idiot.  You won't hear us talking about them.  If you don't care about someone, you just don't mention them. 
[03:33:00]  You don't talk about them.  You don't care.  Because you don't care.  John and Jeff don't care.  Oh, we care about John and Jeff because they're such tools.  Oh, that's funny.  Bernie got me in the hallway.  Oh, are you injured?  No, no, no.  Oh, I thought you said Bernie shot me in the hallway.  What about John and Jeff?  Nothing, dude.  You know, we're in the middle of something here, you ass.  What?  Exactly.  He comes logging in.  John and Jeff.  What?  John and Jeff?  No.  Stop playing chess. 
[03:33:30]  What?  You're pulling me off the air.  Then they did a stunt where they replaced us with Opie and Anthony while we were, you know,  like their best of show.  And I go, why would I care?  You can replace me with whatever you want.  Yeah, that's what they're playing right now.  That's not even, doesn't even come close.  Yeah, I mean, yeah.  I go, why would that even offend me?  The only thing you're going to offend is a bunch of churchgoing people who are upset  about how they got pulled off the air.  I said, this doesn't get to me.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't even know why you're involved with me like this. 
[03:34:00]  Say I don't care five times in one sentence.  Put that tape through stress analysis, like send it off to the FBI, and see how it comes  back.  It'll look like the earthquake that caused the tsunami.  They think I give a crap about Opie and Anthony, or Man Cow, or any of these guys.  I don't care.  I don't care.  You know, I just don't put them all on.  I mean, I've seen what they can do.  That's right.  He just doesn't care, Anthony.  I don't care.  And he did a lot more of this today. 
[03:34:30]  Who's going up to look for Bernie's gun?  We got a map.  It's like four miles north of Londonderry in Weston.  Just outside of Weston, there's a bridge perhaps to the east, I think he said.  There's not many.  And it was across from a garbage dump that isn't there anymore.  God, imagine having that gun.  I would love to find that gun.  Cool would that be?  Fareed thinks he's going to put like Opie and Anthony on him.  We get all upset about it, and that's going to make me somehow twist in the wind. 
[03:35:00]  And I don't care.  I honestly don't care.  Honestly don't care.  Did you count the I don't care?  I don't care.  There's millions of them.  Why would I care?  I don't care.  There's absolutely millions of them.  If you don't care.  You did another 20 minutes of not caring about us today.  Yeah, and 20 minutes today.  That's yesterday's I don't cares.  Today, another 20 minutes of I don't care.  How do you?  If you don't care, you just don't care, and you don't mention it.  No one knows you don't care, because you're not saying you don't care every two seconds. 
[03:35:30]  But there he is.  I don't care.  I so don't care.  I so completely fucking don't care.  Why can't Mel control them anymore for me?  I'm sure he also didn't care about Allison taking half his money.  He didn't care about his daughter's problem at a party.  I'm sure he didn't care about plenty of stuff.  He's seen what you guys can do.  I can't wait until he comes up with another song parody contest.  This way, maybe I could win the money this time.  Take it home.  Joe enters his song parody contest, by the way. 
[03:36:00]  I curse that microphone.  Again?  Oh, man.  I curse that microphone.  Nothing?  I got nothing.  I'll just observe.  Anyway, Joe's like the guy that would be in medical school up in the observation thing  as they're doing surgery and come down and try to tie off the gallbladder.  It's like, what are you doing?  No.  Watch.  What's so bad?  He's turning red.  I am.  No shit.  What's the matter, Joe?  You're right. 
[03:36:30]  He's doing all uncomfortable.  It always happens that way, though.  No matter what I say.  What is a string of poloponies?  It's become a bit.  I meant to say polo ponies.  Ah, they all make them.  We didn't really intro you or anything.  You just kind of popped up.  I didn't know what was going on.  I don't care if people know who I am.  It doesn't matter.  You're your aunt's brother, Joe.  And you do great song parodies.  And I suck on the air.  And yes, one of the many things we did to Howard, you got a couple songs in a song parody contest.  Yeah.  He ended up really liking your songs a lot until we told everybody on our show that one of your songs was being played on his. 
[03:37:00]  And then the song disappeared.  And we got in trouble for that one, too.  Because the best thing is...  Because people just in radio in general just don't have a sense of humor.  Remember we got yelled at?  Yes, we did.  For that big time?  But Don Imus, though, is the funniest thing ever.  Yeah.  What was it?  Was it a song parody contest for...  Yeah, it was pretty much anything.  It was wide open.  You could write it about anyone on the show or anything.  And I did that on Rich the Fat Naked Fag on Survivor.  No, that was the one.  Survivor.  Where is that song?  We have it?  Yeah, you probably got it somewhere. 
[03:37:30]  So then it was...  I don't know.  It was a contest and he was looking for the best song or something.  They kept playing it and going, oh, this one's funny.  This is the best one.  I was a finalist.  I was a finalist and up for 10 grand.  But obviously, I couldn't win it.  And we were all in on it, man.  Friends and families of employees of Infinity Broadcasting are not eligible.  Can't put you in a prize contest.  It's illegal.  They actually had to postpone announcing the winner.  Postpone.  It turned out to be a cluster F and we were in on it from the beginning.  And we thought it was hilarious. 
[03:38:00]  Our listeners thought it was hilarious.  The radio community in general thought it was hilarious.  Well, that isn't everything, but winning that song parody contest, that's important.  He wasn't saying, I don't care back then.  He was saying, I'm not your daddy.  I'm not your daddy.  Remember that speech?  He would always go on those tirades.  So then we got sat down behind closed doors and yelled at.  Yelled at again.  And pretty much, they threatened to fire us again.  Who said he's not your daddy?  Howard.  He used to say that all the time.  Love me, daddy.  Love me, daddy.  That was what he was crying when we japped him with the song parody. 
[03:38:30]  Maybe he should have loved as a daddy.  It prevented some problems.  Anyway.  Get rid of the Bernie Gets stuff.  John and Jeff.  Nice.  Why do we have pictures of them?  Well, if this doesn't say a lot about your radio show, John and Jeff, we got a shot of their website.  And one of the guys has a picture with Hammer from 1991 that he's so proud of that it's on the website. 
[03:39:00]  That says a lot about the radio show right there.  But here's what it says even more.  Under the picture, it says Hammer Time, and there's an exclamation point.  Well, you got to put the exclamation after Hammer Time.  But do you understand how awful exclamation points are in comedy?  They never work.  It's like Hammer Time.  It said, here's John, dot, dot, dot.  And then there's another picture.  And here's Jeff.  Exclamation point.  Zoo crew douchebags. 
[03:39:30]  All right.  Speaking of who's your daddy.  Did you get to see who's your daddy yet?  No.  I guess the Post is really pissed off.  The Post of all.  Why is the Post pissed off?  Didn't the Post have a naked picture in it today?  The Post, yeah.  It's got Tara Reade's booby.  The Post has no problem showing all sorts of debauchery.  But they're really pissed off at this new show, Who's Your Daddy?  Why?  Or is it the other paper?  Who is your daddy?  See, the Post and the Daily News, they're pretty much the same paper, so I always get confused. 
[03:40:00]  They're pissed off.  Oh, this is Monday's paper.  That's why.  Some people are all annoyed because it makes light of adoption, I guess they're saying.  They take some chick.  Oh, what's the Post?  Stand her in front of a few men, one of which is her father, her birth father.  She doesn't know it.  And I guess she tries to figure out who her real daddy is.  Yeah.  Look.  I absolutely love the concept. 
[03:40:30]  And the girl that's trying to find her daddy is this hot piece of ass.  Real hot.  Looks like a stripper with breast implants.  It was kind of sick.  Really, really sexy.  Because, you know, all right, maybe even her daddy, you know, her daddy is standing there  and he's probably looking at her because he don't know it from a hole in the wall.  Yeah.  Probably looking at her like, wow, what a set of cans on her.  She's a hot piece of ass.  But, you know, at least all the other guys are gawking at her because she's hot.  And she's looking at them all as potential fathers.  So it kind of gave this sick, incestuous theme to the whole show. 
[03:41:00]  We were watching some clips of it and listening to some sound clips in the office.  Earlier, a lot of weeping.  You are in hell over here trying to find this.  You're like Bernie shuffling through his song list.  Because this is a different version of The Post.  You sure it was The Post?  Ben raised a good point.  They own Fox.  It's the same company.  Why were they?  Oh, that's true.  There's always that bias that goes on with The Post.  Oh, my God.  Might be the Daily News. 
[03:41:30]  That would be my second mistake.  Ben, don't you mean they own by the same company?  Let me see.  Was there a different version of The Post?  They're owned by the same company, Gabner.  Let me see.  That's how Rupert Murdoch over there.  Hey.  Maybe he read that in the Daily Mirror.  All right, my mistake.  British ass.  My mistake.  We're going to keep up with heaven and with the queen.  My mistake again.  Two mistakes today.  It was in the Daily News, wasn't it?  What are they unloading?  Oh, there's all kinds of stuff going on out there.  I doubt it's my computer or chair. 
[03:42:00]  We know what it's not.  Let's narrow it down.  It's not anything we need.  No.  What is it?  They got the photocopier here finally.  Is it hooked up and working?  Is it working?  They're setting it up over there.  Everyone's like, what?  You're not in on that inside gig yet.  Chris from Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  I saw who was your daddy last night.  Okay.  It sucked like every other fucking fuck, though.  It did suck.  That blonde was really hot, though, no? 
[03:42:30]  Well, yeah, she was kind of hot, but when she cried, she looked just fucking disgusting.  She was kind of hot in a stripper way, which is kind of marginal at best, but you could tell  the guys that were there, a bunch of older guys, they were gawking at her.  When her mother came on stage and you saw what she was going to look like when she gets  older, it was nothing to be happy of.  Yeah.  Yeah, but...  All right.  Thank you, Chris.  So, the adoption agencies out there are pissed off at this show.  Oh, yes.  And David Bianculli, Bianculli, some TV critic, is just up in arms because I don't know. 
[03:43:00]  I don't know.  Because it's bad.  It's exploitation.  Yeah, it's horrible, it's indefensible television, it should never have been made.  Does he complain about Maury Povich and Oprah and all those other shows that have been  reuniting and capitalizing on that for decades?  Well, here's the deal.  Douchebag.  Who's your daddy?  In the mold of Joe Millionaire and my big, fat, obnoxious fiancé, a young woman named  TJ, adopted at six weeks when given up by her since-divorced parents, was asked to 
[03:43:30]  choose from among eight men, one of whom was her biological father.  Yay.  The rest were imposters trying to trick her into selecting them instead.  Trick her.  If TJ guessed right through the various elimination rounds and identified her actual father, she  won $100,000, Anthony.  If not, the prize money went to the man who fooled her.  What fun, what merriment.  What's wrong?  That's what he writes, sarcastically.  So, I thought it was a great concept. 
[03:44:00]  It is merriment, and it is fun.  Why not?  It's TV.  They signed on for it.  How exploitive can it be?  She agreed to this premise.  No one's being tricked.  She agreed that, okay, yeah, I have a chance to win $100,000 by picking out my real father.  Sure, I'll do it.  One Fox affiliate didn't run it, didn't sign on to run it, and instead ran a documentary  on adoption.  I'm sure they just really won in the ratings on that night.  Sanctimonious asses.  Not only do I agree with the show, but I think she should have been forced to sleep with every 
[03:44:30]  one of the contestants.  Now, that would have been the better thing.  Absolutely.  Have her try to eliminate who her father isn't by sleeping with them, and then find out at  the end if she actually slept with her father.  That is a goddamn show.  He was the one that came back twice.  Nothing has changed.  Stupid post.  She guesses it's her father, recognizing the smell of whiskey on his breath as she wipes  the whiskers against her cheek. 
[03:45:00]  Shh, quiet now, little girl.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  That's my special girl.  Let me show you how to make boys like you.  Oh, you creep.  You are a creep.  You do it too well, man.  We got clips from the show.  Fat black guy with glass dildos in that group.  Be my special girl.  All right.  We get it, Jim.  Thank you.  Thanks for creeping us out more than better.  Let's, yeah, here's a clip from Who's Your Daddy?  It was an incredible moment to see her for the first time. 
[03:45:30]  It's been a long lifetime dream of mine, and I'm so proud of her.  To find my daughter was my main objective.  And if she won some of this money, it was a bonus.  And it was really hard not to jump off those stairs and go down and run and hug her.  Yeah.  She's my daughter.  Yeah, so she comes out, and the eight guys are, like, standing there.  Yeah.  And this guy is like, Jesus, that's my daughter.  And what a piece of ass.  And I don't want these guys, you know, getting all creepy with her. 
[03:46:00]  Gawking at her.  Can I ask why James Gumm was looking for his daughter?  Oh, my God.  That did sound like it.  I mean, is she a great big fat daughter?  She was a large baby.  Then this is classic.  So she's standing there.  I got her card in here somewhere.  She's standing there, TJ, the hot blonde with the big boobies there.  Yeah.  And all these guys, there's eight of them, all say how, you know, they're her father.  Her daddy.  One at a time.  Listen to this.  So, gentlemen, would you please introduce yourself?  Hi, TJ. 
[03:46:30]  My name is Carl.  I'm from Simi Valley, California.  And I'm your dad.  I'm your daddy.  Good evening, TJ.  My name is Scott.  I live in Olympia, Washington.  Scott Peterson.  You know it wasn't him.  I'm your dad.  Hi, TJ.  My name is Charlie.  I live in Yuma, Arizona.  And I'm your dad.  Hi, TJ.  My name is Peter.  I'm from Mesa, Arizona.  And I'm your dad.  Hi, TJ.  My name is Ray.  I'm from Redondo Beach, California.  And I'm your dad.  Hello, TJ. 
[03:47:00]  My name is Rick.  I'm from San Clemente, California.  And I'm your dad.  And I'm a peeler.  Hi, TJ.  I'm Jerry.  I live in Norco, California.  And I'm your dad.  Hi, TJ.  My name is Sam.  I'm from Little Rock, Arkansas.  And I'm your dad.  Hi.  And I'm not your dad.  Wow.  One guy sounded like he was getting choked up there.  Yeah.  Could have been the...  The actor in the group.  You think?  Yeah, if he cared so much, he wouldn't have taken off on her.  Yeah, if Fox is going to show one guy crying out of all of them, obviously that's the guy  that's not going to be it. 
[03:47:30]  Don't fall for that silly TV trick.  Don't fall for that old gag.  One of those guys is my dad.  There was this one guy that seemed to have...  Sounds all sexy.  Hot, man.  One of those guys is my dad, and I'm going to give him a BJ he'll never be.  Yeah.  He's not really my dad.  Just biologically.  And he looks like the gopher in Caddyshacket.  He's a fine radio show producer.  And he herky jerks.  I have true emotions.  Scott. 
[03:48:00]  Then I looked around, and then my attention was drawn to Charlie.  And then Sam caught my attention, because he kept looking down, and it was like...  He was trying so hard not to show emotion.  Trying hard not to look at your boobs.  Right.  That's a dead giveaway.  Are you excited?  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  The more I hear her talk, the more I understand why he left, you melodramatic L.A. whore actress.  Phony. 
[03:48:30]  One of these guys is my dad.  But I thought it might be him, too.  Ugh, you auditioning piglet.  Kind of creepy, because you know, there was probably some kind of sexual attraction to some of these guys on her part.  Right?  You're just human.  You're standing there, right?  And then, you know, one of them is the dad.  But odds are, the one she might be attracted to might not be.  I am so looking forward to seeing if I could actually know my dad out of eight men. 
[03:49:00]  I am so excited.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Isn't she just atrocious?  Maybe it's the guy who says under his breath, but audible enough to hear,  I should have kicked your mom in the stomach when I had the chance.  Maybe that's a clue.  Ugh.  What an annoying whore.  He should have dented that mother's stomach like Foreman did the heavy bag in When We Were Kings. 
[03:49:30]  Ugh.  All right, so, we've set up a cocktail party here so you can talk to the guys.  We've told all the men everything that you know about your birth father.  I'm sure you've got a lot of questions that you want to ask them.  You want to ask them immediately.  Most definitely, yeah.  Vanola set up a cocktail party for me, and I am going to be able to talk to each of these men  and find out more about their birth father.  Ginger on Gilligan's Island sounds like all better actors.  You ready? 
[03:50:00]  Yeah.  Okay, this is Sam and Peter.  Hi.  So have fun.  Okay.  See you in a bit.  She's leaving me.  Daddy diva.  Daddy diva.  Stupid voice.  You want to listen to some of the audio from the cocktail party?  Only if there's a fist hitting her in the throat.  I'd love to hear that.  She is just auditioning.  You're right.  Oh, and stop trying to be moving.  It's so exciting.  Yeah, you're an adult woman.  It doesn't matter anymore.  Yeah, you're not moving anymore.  We don't care that you're abandoned. 
[03:50:30]  You're a coke whore.  Awful.  You're going to meet your new daddy.  You're going to go out to dinner a couple times.  That's it.  Who cares?  Yeah, and you wind up sleeping with a couple of his friends because they're probably producers.  Okay.  I want to ask so many things.  What two things would your friends say to describe you?  To a fault.  Honest.  And willing to help.  Okay.  Honest, willing to help, and abandoning.  Honest, willing to help, and abandoning.  Honest, hung, and incestuous. 
[03:51:00]  You're Rick?  Yes.  And you're Charlie?  Yes.  What would you guys say your biggest passion is?  Hot kids.  Find the good in everybody.  The right poetry.  M&M's.  Oh, I had to stop that because it's getting too fat.  Carl said something.  M&M's.  He said, right on with what I like.  My number one candy when I was a little girl was M&M's.  M&M's.  And you put him on his yam bag.  Give me a Roman war helmet.  And bicycle riding, but I like to go slower because you can absorb a lot more. 
[03:51:30]  I got no feelings.  I just love the water.  And I hope I wasn't rude.  But I just didn't want to miss any opportunity to lay my eyes on my dad.  How would your friends describe you?  She should have a frog cut like a lamb.  Rick?  Kind of had like sharp features, like triangular.  But I have round features.  Trustworthy.  Sincere. 
[03:52:00]  And a lot of fun.  And Charlie had a little bit of round features, but not like mine, in my opinion.  What do you dislike most in other people?  Cheaters.  A child throwing.  Telemarketers at dinner time.  Ray.  The first thing I thought, he's too tall.  He's too big boned.  Then I kept looking at him.  When he smiles, he has kind of the same smile as me.  So I was like, oh, so confused on him.  My friends would probably describe me as regarius. 
[03:52:30]  Giving.  And I would hope they would say I'm generous.  I got such a warm, amazing feeling from Scott that I actually had to look away.  Then he ain't your father.  He's either an academy or an actor.  It's the guy that abandoned you.  He's not going to have a warm, honest, sincere...  Generous.  Generous.  Generous with seeds.  And then I said, oh my God.  Chintzy on the child support.  What if it's not my dad?  And what if it's this guy over here and I'm totally not paying any attention to him?  And then his feelings are hurt because I thought it was this guy. 
[03:53:00]  Anyway.  He's in there somewhere.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How funny would it be if the big goof at the end was that none of these guys were our  father.  He was actually killed in a drunk driving accident when you were six.  See, if I was a producer of a TV show, that's how it would end.  None of these.  There's a surprise twist.  None of them are your father.  Oh, wait.  Are they going to bring him out?  No, no, no.  No, no.  Tying his shoes and backed over in the driveway.  Here's a picture of his tombstone.  You can visit it. 
[03:53:30]  No mention of you as a child on it.  You ate his ashes in the pudding that you had in episode three.  Stupid.  So you can be together forever.  Melodramatic.  Dullard.  Oh.  Oh, that would be the best ending ever.  Hard show.  Ever.  To get to know TJ with other men around, there was a jealousy.  There was a fear.  What's your...  Actually, the jealousy was, these guys are trying to be a father to my daughter.  It's very hard. 
[03:54:00]  I love this guy.  That's the father.  He's like all pissed off because they're trying to be a father to my daughter.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, man.  Yeah, what they did was they, throughout the show,  they would black out one of the guys and, you know, he'd talk with that voice and that  was the real father.  Right.  So you couldn't identify him, but you would get his input.  I was getting frustrated that the other guys were trying to be the father.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Could you help me with this couch?  Here she is crying. 
[03:54:30]  Here she's crying.  My mother will pay you.  And it's weird because, um, it's hard to forget his look after he danced.  He looked at me and looked like, um, I'll do whatever it takes for you.  I wonder what look that was. 
[03:55:00]  Was it the look of a man hailing a cab and amstraying?  Amstraying.  We're running out of time on the show and we've got to get to the big reveal.  But first, here's the father again.  When I was up there and I looked across her, I pictured her all the way at her first time  she ever danced. 
[03:55:30]  And here she is teaching me and a beautiful woman.  Hello, exactly!  All right, well, and here's the big reveal, I guess, huh?  Ready for this?  What?  I was just so anxious.  Here's the big reveal if she gets to find out which one of these guys is her father.  Dad, I feel that I first knew it was you during the cocktail party. 
[03:56:00]  And I remember when I walked out.  You think I missed the way you stood there with pride?  And I figured that's what you would want your daughter to be like.  When we sat down and I was asking you questions,  you said, be strong.  And I thank you for that.  I believe that my father is Charlie. 
[03:56:30]  Charlie, this is a giant cock.  I don't dislike her.  Was it Charlie?  It was!  It was Charlie!  It was Charlie!  You look like assholes right now, man!  It was Charlie the whole time!  Sweetheart, boy. 
[03:57:00]  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Baby Daddy's here!  Baby Daddy's here!  You've got some funky tastings, Spock.  I'm first in love.  We're gonna go to Disneyland!  Don't be sorry!  I need to ask you one thing.  Please forgive me for the pain that I've caused you.  No!  No!  You're forgiven.  100% forgiven.  Look at you! 
[03:57:30]  Of course, I forgive you.  And that was the greatest words in my entire life.  Do you know what a boob is?  It was to be forgiven by my daughter.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Why don't you stop playing with yourself, buddy?  Oh, my God.  I was so thankful that that magical bond that I was praying for, it exists. 
[03:58:00]  Who is your daddy?  Who is your daddy?  Stop whining.  You're beautiful.  Billy, I'm so proud you're my dad.  You belong to me!  That's my baby.  All right.  You're a strong young lady.  You're a beautiful kid.  It's time now to turn this mush into muscles.  Oh, we got the end of the show here?  Oh, the end of the show music.  What the hell happened?  We were enjoying that special moment.  Damn.  We could have ragged on this another 20 minutes. 
[03:58:30]  That would have been fantastic.  Why did Bernie have to babble on so long?  We stink.  This was the bit of the day.  Of course.  Oh, we blew that one today.  I hope she next stars in a show called Who Has Ovarian Cancer?  Mitch, what's going on?  Hey, I learned that Howard Stern really doesn't care.  Exactly.  I don't care.  I just don't care what they do.  Steve in Jersey, what's up?  Hey.  Hurry!  Way to step on the gas, stupid.  Jeez, you stink.  Yeah, today I learned that Howie just doesn't care. 
[03:59:00]  On the crash sound.  You're pulling me off the air.  Then they did a stunt where they replaced us with Opie and Anthony while we were, you know,  like their best of show.  And I go, why would I care?  You can replace me with whatever you want.  I don't care.  They think I give a crap about Opie and Anthony or Man Cow or any of these guys.  I don't care.  Man Cow.  Put them all on.  You know, I just don't put them all on.  I'm 40 minutes into the conversation and I don't care.  I mean, I've seen what they can do. 
[03:59:30]  He just doesn't care.  For anything, he's going to put like Opie and Anthony on.  I'm going to get all upset about it.  And that's going to make me somehow twist in the wind.  And I don't care.  It's only been two days I'm talking about.  I don't care.  I honestly don't care.  I sincerely, honestly don't ever even care.  Please keep not caring because it's really helping out our radio program, Howie.  Four seconds or three?  Two or one?  Make up your mind.  Oh, we've got to say one more thing before we leave.

[04:01:00]  Everybody in Hollywood, they're so show busy.  Everybody's in show business.  Everybody you meet, the people at drugstore, grocery store, waiters, waitresses.  They're all frustrated screenwriters, directors, actors.  Even a policeman stops me for drunk driving.  He's a frustrated choreographer.  Instead of having me walk the line, he wants me to follow after him.  All right, here we go.  And follow that to me.  Step, kick, pull, change, step, rise, and step, step.  Step, kick, pull, change, step, rise, and step, step.  Smile, pretty shuffle off the puffer.  Now, pretty fingers.  So I miss the step, bitch.  Don't get me pithy.  I am in a mood. 
[04:01:30]  Skydiving was definitely the scariest thing I've ever done.  Let me ask you this question in regards to the skydiving.  What is the point of the helmet in the skydiving?  I mean, can you kind of make it?  You jump out of that plane, that chute doesn't open.  The helmet is now wearing you for protection. 
[04:02:00]  Later on, the helmet's talking with the other helmets,  going, it's a good thing he was there, or I would have hit the ground directly.  There are many things that we could point to  as proof that the human being is not smart.  The helmet is my personal favorite.  The fact that we had to invent the helmet.  Now, why did we invent the helmet?  Well, because we were participating in many activities that were cracking our heads.  We looked at the situation. 
[04:02:30]  We chose not to avoid these activities,  but to just make little plastic hats  so that we can continue our head-cracking lifestyles.  The only thing dumber than the helmet is the helmet law,  the point of which is to protect a brain that is functioning so poorly  it's not even trying to stop the cracking of the head that it's in.  At least the helmet is functional clothing.  I appreciate that.  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio.
