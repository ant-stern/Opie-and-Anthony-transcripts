<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a discussion of Michelle Obama's appearance on Jay Leno, criticizing her perceived coldness and inauthenticity,  specifically her interaction with Gabby Douglas over an Egg McMuffin and further comments about Douglas's appearance. This transitioned into a broader critique of the 2012 presidential election and perceived media bias. A significant portion of the show revolved around a video of one host's fear of heights at the Willis Tower in Chicago, sparking a discussion about phobias and a humorous, morbid hypothetical scenario about government-orchestrated public deaths.  D.L. Hughley and Bob Kelly were guests throughout the broadcast.

The show included extensive riffing on the *Expendables 2* trailer, featuring crude jokes about the aging action stars.  Detailed, humorous anecdotes about a trip to Chicago were shared, covering visits to the Willis Tower and Wrigley Field, along with a comparison of their own tourist behavior with that of typical tourists.  The Chicago discussion extended to a discussion of New York City rats, including a viral video, and plans for a unique New York City experience.  Clips from a Roseanne Barr roast (featuring Amy Schumer, Jeff Ross, and Tom Arnold) and an older “Manager’s Corner” with Earl Weaver (noted for highly offensive language) were played, along with an Uncle Paul segment (also containing offensive material).

A subsequent segment focused on a guest's movie filming experience in a rough neighborhood, culminating in a spitting contest, and their gambling experiences in Chicago and Las Vegas casinos, including Anthony’s account of losing and winning back $60,000.  Different blackjack variations were discussed, along with the low win rate in casinos.  This segued into promotion of Bob Kelly’s comedy shows and a "Fuck You" call segment from listeners.  The guest's fear of heights, stemming from a high-rise hotel experience, was revisited, broadening the discussion to phobias and intrusive thoughts. The segment concluded with a graphic discussion about the joys and annoyances of dog ownership, including detailed descriptions of dog bodily functions.

The show continued with a discussion about the challenges of dog walking and cleaning up after dogs, including various vulgar descriptions of fecal cleanup methods.  The arrival of D.L. Hughley (promoting his book "I Want You To Shut The Fuck Up") shifted the conversation to the 2012 US Presidential election, filled with profanity and racially charged commentary criticizing both parties. Hughley also discussed his marriage using racially charged humor. The hosts shared anecdotes about their relationships, using vulgar humor to discuss marital disputes and perspectives on monogamy.

The final segment began with a discussion of the hosts' preferences in women, leading into promotion of D.L. Hughley’s book signing and Bob Kelly's upcoming comedy shows. A fabricated story about Bruce Springsteen unexpectedly performing at Kelly's show was shared.  Graphic descriptions of Katy Perry's buttocks in a paparazzi photo followed.  The hosts then discussed their work, including a detailed recounting of one host's altercation with a woman's ex-boyfriend.  The show concluded with further promotion of Bob Kelly's shows and D.L. Hughley's podcast.

[00:03:00]  Thank you.  It's not good. 
[00:03:30]  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  If you sound like this offensive, just don't listen.  But my guess is, you'll be sticking around.  Let's do this.  It's going down jack.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM's satellite radio.  This is good radio right here.  Y'all are cooler and shit.  It starts funny and it gets very uncomfortable.  One of the most popular radio shows in the world.  Radio journalism at its best.  Hello, kids. 
[00:04:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  They swear and they're vulgar and they talk about awful, awful things.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Very flavorful.  Yay.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Please welcome Opie.  The show is twisted.  I'm telling you, who's enjoying this shit?  That's what you like, isn't it?  Anthony.  The I want dick crisis.  I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you, ladies.  Remember that.  That's what you like, isn't it?  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, he would say, die.

[00:04:30]  Clean your heart.  Clean your heart.  Oh, good morning.  And welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:05:00]  We got D.L. Hughley coming in today.  Nice.  Oh, yeah.  And Bob Kelly.  Yes, Bobby.  We'll be helping us out today a little bit, a little bit.  Bobby's been filming his pilot thing there.  Yeah, we'll find out about that.  He's like a copper guy, a copper.  Yep.  And Jim Norton on Jay Leno tonight.  Let's not forget.  Oh, yes.  Mark your calendars.  Yes.  The first lady was on there last night, I guess. 
[00:05:30]  She's so not likable.  Gabby Douglas.  She's so not likable.  Yeah, she's not a very warm person.  She doesn't come across.  But not many first ladies have come across as warm people.  To be honest with you.  Look, man, I wasn't a Bush fan, but I liked his wife there.  Yeah.  She was a good first lady.  Yeah, yeah.  She kind of was there.  I don't know.  Hillary was a good first lady.  Not warm.  Not like, there's just something about Michelle Obama. 
[00:06:00]  And don't corner me into that black shit.  What?  Well, I mean, if you talk like this, oh, is it because she's black?  No, it's not.  There's something about her.  I don't know what it is.  I don't like that.  Yeah.  I'm not a fan.  She's like, I don't know.  What am I trying?  I'm trying to like, hmm.  She comes across as like, I don't know.  It's everything's put on.  Yeah.  All right.  She doesn't seem honest with who she is. 
[00:06:30]  I think.  I think.  I'm from Connecticut using the word cunty.  I was going to use a different word because I'm a little scared.  A little scared.  Of the black helicopters.  There's, I think she's, I believe she's bitchy.  Yeah.  And she realizes, well, I can't be bitchy.  I'm the first lady.  Yeah.  So I think she, you're absolutely right.  I think she plays this role.  Yeah.  She tries to come off like.  What, you know, she expects people to think she is. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it doesn't, she's not pulling it off.  She comes across as cold, as phony, as not a.  Cold, bitchy.  Yeah.  Bitchy.  Dishonest.  Yeah.  And then.  And the way she presents herself.  I can't even imagine what goes on when, you know, after hours at the White House.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Some yelling.  Oh, my God.  Just yelling.  She just seems like that type of broad, right?  You know, she's on there last night with America's little sweetheart there, Gabby Douglas. 
[00:07:30]  Nice.  From the Olympics.  Nice.  Gymnast.  Gold medal winner.  And so they're talking about, you know, she's talking about what she's going to do and  everything.  And she mentioned she's going to splurge and get herself some egg McMuffins.  And the first lady, Michelle Obama's got to lean over and be like, now, now, you're making  me look bad.  Like, what do you mean, making her look bad?  You know, she's got this whole thing going on about obesity, childhood obesity, and don't 
[00:08:00]  eat a bunch of fucking food and get fat.  Right.  Look who she's talking to.  The picture of fucking physical health and stuff.  A little gymnast that's flipping around parallel bars and she doesn't have a half a percent  of body fat on her.  That's someone that can eat whatever the fuck she wants.  Well, you should add to the argument here that she's an athlete that hasn't eaten anything  bad in probably 10 years. 
[00:08:30]  So if she's going to let her hair down, as they like to say, and have a McMuffin, who  gives a fuck?  That's very different than having an eating problem.  That, to me, is the epitome of someone trying to get in your shit.  Like, all right, people say, well, there's an obesity problem, you know.  If some big fat slob was sitting there, fine, you know.  Mm-hmm.  But, uh, Gabby could also eat that Egg McMuffin right through a chain link fence.  Swear to God, right through it.  I don't understand that.  Her choppers could fit right through one of those little holes in the links. 
[00:09:00]  Was that racist?  I'm not sure.  No.  Not at all.  Oh, okay.  That's a Bucky tooth thing.  Oh, okay.  She's got Bucky teeth.  Okay, I got scared for a moment.  I thought you were.  No!  She's beautiful, man, when she gets out of those gym clothes.  Does she look like a midget, though?  Next to normal people?  She's a total fidget.  People meaning just people walking around, by the way.  She's a midget.  Because on the, uh, when they're doing their gymnastics, they all look tall because they're  all short.  The coaches are short.  Everyone's short, so you just seem like a normal, quote, normal person. 
[00:09:30]  But then you walk around with the normal people, meaning just people walking around.  Then it's obvious how tiny you really are.  Yep.  All right.  Is this the clip?  Gotta go.  Yeah, there it is.  Let's play this.  You train your whole life.  You win.  How did you celebrate?  What did you do?  We didn't have time to celebrate.  It was, uh, team finals and had to turn the page all around finals, then event finals after  that.  But, uh, after the competition, I splurged on, uh, Egg McMuffin at McDonald's.  Egg McMuffin.  Yeah, Gabby, we don't, don't, don't encourage you. 
[00:10:00]  Pause.  Pause.  And that's the other thing I forgot.  She thinks she's really funny.  Yeah.  I forgot about that.  She thinks she's a hoot.  She, she, uh, thinks she has a great sense of humor and she can't wait to share that with  the world.  And what's wrong with an Egg McMuffin?  It's not that bad for you.  Oh, look out.  What's in the Egg McMuffin that's really bad?  She wants to take that shit away and have a veggie McVeggie veg.  But isn't, Egg McMuffin, it's fake eggs, I guess, but that's eggy.  Fake egg. 
[00:10:30]  And then what do you get on there?  And then you get a little, uh, what?  Little cheese and then what's the, and, and, and a bread product, right?  You can eat way worse than that at McDonald's.  Yeah.  I think that's one of the better things to eat, right?  You can want them sausage McMuffins.  Even with the ham on it.  How many calories?  300 calories for one?  That's up there.  But I mean, if you, if you, if you take the cheese off or if you take that ham off or  sausage, whatever, it's really not, that's really not that bad for you.  It's just a pretty goddamn righteous. 
[00:11:00]  Maybe we should get some.  All right, continue with Michelle Obama.  She's cracking everyone up.  Yeah.  I'm sure it was on a whole wheat McMuffin.  It was on a whole wheat bun.  On a whole wheat bun.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  So an egg McMuffin, very good.  You're setting me back, Gabby.  I'm sorry.  Oh, my God.  I so badly wanted to say, well, you shut the hell up.  Shut up.  So is that a, is that an egg McMuffin in your crotch?  Because it looks pretty big when you were out there on the floor. 
[00:11:30]  What is that there in your, in your crotch?  I see something, something pretty big on there.  Yeah.  It says worst of on the pad data.  Is that true, E-Rock?  What?  And why are you reading the newspaper?  Cool.  Maybe I'm home sleeping.  Why the fuck is E-Rock reading the newspaper?  What?  Why wouldn't...  All right.  What were you reading, then?  I was reading about the quotes between Ryan and Obama, but...  You're reading about Ryan and Obama?  Yeah.  All right.  What'd you learn?  Do a political show.  Close the paper. 
[00:12:00]  Okay.  All right.  You were just reading the newspaper.  What have you learned?  They were talking about jobs, as usual.  And he asked theirs.  In one bar here, Ryan was saying, he goes, you can ask, when the president comes through  town, you can ask him, same question I've been getting asked all the time, Mr. President,  and where are all the jobs?  And it's just going back and forth between who's going to have better job growth between  the Republicans and Obama.  Oh, well, look at you.  Face to me.  All right.  What about the...  And it doesn't say worst of it.  It says Opie and Anthony. 
[00:12:30]  I'm both of it.  That's why I'm asking.  Just to make sure.  We are live.  It's August 14th, 2012.  Does he know more about the article or what just happened on the show?  What were we talking about?  You were talking about Egg McMuffins and how Michelle Obama wouldn't shut up on Jay Leno.  Damn, you're multitasking today.  Man.  I like it.  Gabby Douglas is very adorable.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's adorable.  If you're into that kind of thing.  What?  You know.  Gymnast?  Yeah.  Short girls. 
[00:13:00]  Why do you hate gymnasts so much?  No, I don't.  I don't.  I like that little Michaela.  Yeah.  Maroney.  Yeah.  Maroney.  Maroney Jabroni.  How old is she?  I don't know.  16 or something like that.  If she was of age.  She's a midget.  I think you would have a shot at that.  I don't think so.  Why not?  I don't think so.  I said if she was of age.  Oh.  That's what I said.  Did you see her on a double-decker bus doing a little dance with the bush daughter?  No.  She does her little dance. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  She was teaching one of the bush daughters how to do some kind of fucking little dance.  McDonald's sponsors the Olympics.  Maybe she had to say McMuffin.  I think it's kind of silly that McDonald's sponsors the Olympics, by the way.  Yeah.  That kind of goes against the whole thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, but it's, you know, moderation.  Doesn't matter.  Look, see?  She's doing a little dance.  She's teaching her how to do a little wacky little dance. 
[00:14:00]  And where was this clip?  I guess they're just driving around the streets of England.  Yeah.  On one of those double-decky buses.  Yeah.  Trying to teach.  And I don't know what, like, which bush is that?  Who's that big broad?  That's one of the bush?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that gymnast is a midget.  Totally.  She's got to be, what, four or eight?  They're all little midgets.  Holy fuck.  They're going to move, though.  They're going to move, though.  Yeah.  That's nice.  You'd like that, right?  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  You'd like that, right?  Non-story.  Move on.  What? 
[00:14:30]  This guy thought Michelle Obama was funny?  Oh, please call the show.  Who's that?  Don't hide behind a stupid instant feedback.  The phone number is right on your pad data.  Please call.  Call you piece of shit?  Don't hide behind the dumb instant feedback, which has to go away.  You got a phone.  The number's right on the pad data.  Call us.  You thought that Michelle Obama thing was funny?  It's political, dude.  He's just being political.  The Obamas can do no wrong if you're hardcore.  But why does everyone have to have blinders on? 
[00:15:00]  Everyone does.  I think everyone does.  Most polarized fucking election I've ever, ever seen, ever.  Which is horrible for the country.  And such mudslinging going on on both sides.  It's ridiculous.  Both sides with the inaccuracies, outright lying, taking shit so far out of context it doesn't even resemble what was said in the first place.  Right.  It's, uh, and, and, and then getting on and trying to be like the other people are the only ones doing it.  Yeah, stop.  I completely agree with you. 
[00:15:30]  It's all horse shit.  And it's horrible for the country.  It is.  Yeah, you watch MSNBC, they, they beat the shit out of, uh, the right.  Then you watch Fox, they beat the shit out of the left.  Yep.  It's, and then CNN just doesn't know what the fuck they're doing.  Oh, they're just trying to get ratings.  They're fucking horrible.  Oh, are they hurting?  God.  Yeah.  And they just, uh, I don't know how you go to work and just beat the shit out of this one side all day long, knowing nothing will ever change or get accomplished.  Like, what are you hoping for? 
[00:16:00]  To change these guys' minds?  Like, oh, you know what?  You finally made a good point there, sir.  And you're really not, um, you're not changing anyone's mind.  No.  So it's got to be exhausting.  Yeah, it is.  Huh?  It is.  It is, right?  It's exhausting.  You were in that game for a while.  Ah, yeah, still, you know, I still am when, when I, I, I hear a valid point, when I hear an inaccuracy.  Yeah.  I try to, I try to argue the point, you know, not with the blinders on or anything, but, you know, honest, uh, discussion about things. 
[00:16:30]  Right.  Yeah.  How am I on the rag because I want the guy to call to explain himself?  When you hear on instant feedback, that was funny.  That makes me want to talk to the guy.  Hey, what is wrong with you?  I want to know why you thought the Michelle Obama clip was, was funny.  What was funny about it?  Come on now.  So what are you talking about?  What the fuck?  I'm looking for more information.  That's all.  Cause then she was talking about the, the kiss cam, the famous kiss cam thing with, uh, with, uh, Barack. 
[00:17:00]  And I, and you know what?  I really believe that she just didn't want to kiss the guy.  Yeah.  That's what I think.  And, and she has spun that like, Oh, you know, I wasn't ready.  I think she said, Oh, I just arrived.  And I saw, I saw us on the, uh, jumbotron, but I didn't realize it was a kiss thing going on.  Yeah.  She just comes up.  We've all been at sporting events.  You know, when they're doing the kiss cam, it's very obvious.  Yeah.  She usually have some dumb song that has the word kiss in it. 
[00:17:30]  There's usually a border around the jumbotron that says, you know, yeah, everyone looks up at it and stuff.  They all like, you see what it is.  She's not missing it.  She just didn't want to kiss, uh, Barack Obama in public for whatever reason.  I wonder if they even want to kiss behind closed doors.  Cause they probably don't want a picture of like maybe spittle or a tongue or just, you know, everyone's so, they're all so gun shy about having a picture.  That's bad or embarrassing. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  Especially around the election that they just want to everything to be completely choreographed and staged until they could get back into the white house and slam the doors shut and pull the shades down.  And, you know, ah, was it okay?  Did we fuck up today?  You know, it's terrible.  When did that change?  I don't know.  You're so right.  So, you know, real celebrities.  I mean, we, we, we certainly have our fans out there, but real celebrities.  You're so right.  Soon as they leave their house, they're on guard until they get back home. 
[00:18:30]  And then they shut down.  Well, and especially now though, there are a lot of people with cameras and, and things, but, uh, you know, I bet Nixon has pictures of him just digging boogers out of his nose.  He didn't give a shit.  Right now though.  Ah, look out.  Did you see fucking, um, what's the name?  Katy Perry's ass.  I didn't like the ass.  What happened?  Why didn't you like the ass?  Oh, you liked the ass?  I didn't mind the ass.  Could you show the picture again? 
[00:19:00]  It looked a little, uh, looked, uh, well, first of all, it looked like she had a full diaper on.  Well, that was the water that filled up her, her, her diety looking bottoms.  And then, and then because, uh, the bottom wasn't completely off.  Yeah.  It made her ass look like it could be a bit on the long side.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got to see that bend though.  Who am I kidding?  That's not a bad ass at all, but we're all picky assholes, aren't we?  Picky asshole.  Ew. 
[00:19:30]  Uh, actually that one's not bad.  Let me see the other ones.  This is off.  Uh, we haven't given them a plug in a while.  W W T D D.com.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's all right.  Well, yeah.  And it is hard to, I think her boobies make her just over the top.  Yeah.  Phenomenal.  Yeah.  Phenomenal.  I mean, there's better asses out there, obviously.  Yeah.  But it's not, it's, you know, what are we, what are we doing?  It's nice.  You're right.  It's not pale ass on her.  Huh?  Nice and white, right?  Pale ass. 
[00:20:00]  Nice and white.  What are you going to do?  Yeah.  I guess she was on one of those, um, little wakeboard things where it automatically makes  a little wave and you, you get on there and do your little thing and just pull the back  of her fucking bathing suit right off.  Nice.  She's got phenomenal breasts.  Tits, as we like to say.  Oh.  Phenomenal.  Tits.  Tits.  Sam's a pussy.  Yeah.  You're really a pussy, man. 
[00:20:30]  No, I'm not.  What's wrong with you?  And I love how you'll, I love how you'll try to spin anything.  What do you mean spin anything?  When you're standing?  You'll lose on this one.  No, I won't lose on this one.  This, this is what I try to explain to Sam.  We went to the top of the Willis Tower.  They like to call it the Sears Tower in Chicago.  So I want to acknowledge that.  They don't like that.  It's named the Willis Tower.  They hate it.  And, uh, we're 103 floors up.  We're in a, uh, sky deck.  It's a glass box.  You step out into it and the views are ridiculous. 
[00:21:00]  And, yeah, it's a little weird.  The first step is a little weird.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Your brain's like, what the fuck is this?  That's what it does.  But then you've got to say to yourself, well, they wouldn't set up some rickety piece of shit thing up here.  Yeah.  It's been well tested.  And the amount of insurance to allow people just to do that is ridiculous.  It's got to be crazy.  So you've got to assume that nothing is going to happen.  You're at risk going to the damn Willis Tower in a cab.  Generally speaking, people with fear of heights are not really don't have a fear of heights because they're intellectually thinking about it. 
[00:21:30]  Sam, I'm scared of heights.  You're telling me that it's an odd thing.  I'm absolutely scared of heights, but I understand when you're completely safe.  But that's why it exists because it's a scary thing.  Most people are scared of heights.  When you look over an edge at, I don't know, a waterfall, a side of a cliff, or you lean over a bridge to look down, one reason why you're scared of heights, you don't really trust yourself.  And part of you feels like, holy fuck, I'm going to just jump. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  That's part of why you're scared of heights.  If you're scared of heights.  Hold on.  But if you're in a glass box, where are you going?  There's not a chance you could even be stupid and do something.  You wouldn't actually think that you're going to fall, but fear of heights is not a logical thing.  It's just something that clicks in.  Your instincts kick in.  And something in your brain just sets off like, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.  Oh, well, you're a psychiatrist now.  Well, I know that I was up in a box watching little kids dance around in one box. 
[00:22:30]  And when I stepped into it, I was like, holy shit, I got to get out of here.  Don't be scared.  And some people thought you were acting.  And I'm here to say you weren't.  I wasn't acting.  You looked very wimpy.  The reason I looked like I was acting is because I was uncomfortable.  Would you do that?  You would walk out.  Yeah, yeah, I wouldn't.  I wouldn't.  See, but that's what I said before I did it.  I said, oh, yeah, it wouldn't be a big deal.  But to the level of how scared you were is what I'm beating you up for.  I didn't think I would be scared.  I get some of your points, but you were holding on to the side. 
[00:23:00]  That's still attached.  Well, the whole thing's attached to the building, but you know what I mean.  I hope so.  It's part of the mainframe of the building.  It's not the extension.  Yeah.  So he's holding on to that with a death grip.  And then he steps into the box for literally a second and has to get out.  And jumps back.  And jumps back.  I didn't think that if the box fell, me holding on to the building with one hand would save my life.  Well, they did beat you up for that, too, yes. 
[00:23:30]  That would be silly to even think that.  That's illogical, and I'm a highly intelligent person.  You know what you'd have to do?  You're not that highly intelligent.  I'm quite intelligent.  If you can't work your brain around the fact that you're going to be completely fine in the end, you can be scared.  I guess you can't really work around that.  But you can logically go, okay, I'm scared, but I know nothing is going to happen.  All you've got to think is, if the whole box falls, right?  Right.  Now it's plummeting.  You just time it perfectly.  You jump up, right, when it's ready to hit the ground.  Right.  And it just crashes around you.  And you're like, ah, I totally fucking got you. 
[00:24:00]  That's the thinking I need to have in my head at the time.  No, because obviously I thought when I was sitting, Kenny told me, sit down in the box and I'll take your picture.  Right.  Yeah.  And I said, okay, that'll be fine.  And I got in the box and I started sitting down.  But before I could fully sit down, I wasn't able to because something in my head said, if I sit down, my weight will shift the entire box and it will plummet off the building.  Well, that's crazy.  I weigh 138 pounds.  It's not going to happen.  Now, Kenny weighs two, Kenny's what, 220 maybe? 
[00:24:30]  And he was doing jumping jacks.  But none of it's brain, so he's not worried about it.  Yeah, but he does jumping jerks.  It's great.  It's a whole different thing.  And then Roland was taunting you.  Yeah, but then Roland couldn't jump either.  Roland got a little scared when it was time to jump up and down.  Exactly.  Was he scared or just a complete inability to jump?  That sets up at all.  Yeah, I was wondering.  That was the question in the video.  That was the question in the video.  Yeah, yeah.  He was scared when he started jumping.  He got a little scared.  Something got to him, too.  But you and I both know.  And besides that, you were just walking around in there. 
[00:25:00]  You weren't doing any stunts.  You were Mr. Behind the Camera.  I leaned right up against the walls to check out the view.  Roland, were you scared to jump?  I hear what Anthony said.  What?  It's a little bit of both.  I was asking if it was.  Yeah, yeah.  I jumped.  I'm like, ooh.  It's a little hard to jump.  You were scared, right?  It is scary, though.  But you know it's not going to fall apart.  You can feel your balls in your throat.  No.  Exactly.  I'm not.  But who's were they?  Oh, my God.  Jaws.  I know.  What's that about?  This is totally remastered. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, but I've seen this movie a million times.  Blu-ray.  Why is this one?  100th anniversary.  Digital copy.  100th anniversary?  100th anniversary.  Movie's been out 100 years.  It's the 80s.  It's amazing.  100th anniversary.  100th anniversary?  Will we be alive for some of these 100th anniversary films?  I don't know.  I mean, I'm not talking about the dumb one where the stupid bullet hits the moon's eye  or whatever the fuck that is.  Whatever that is.  Was that a rocket ship?  It looked like a bullet to me.  Yeah, it's literally.  I'm talking about movies where when we were kids, they were obviously already. 
[00:26:00]  Birth of a Nation?  Nah, you gotta go, I don't know, like fucking, maybe somewhere in the 50s.  We weren't born in the 50s, but I'm just saying movies that were already sort of, you  know, around.  Casablanca?  Yeah, like a Casablanca.  Cut extras.  Bonus features.  Making of.  Jaws the Restoration.  Deleted scenes and outtakes.  I think I've seen all these.  All right.  Whatever.  Roland.  No, my point is this, Sam. 
[00:26:30]  I get the fear to a point.  And Roland had normal fear.  He was able to do it and then finally he was like, oh fuck, this is a little weird.  You couldn't even step into the damn thing.  No.  That's a phobia.  Are you scared of heights?  Like, can you look out these windows?  Yeah, that's no problem.  So where's your, can you, you can fly.  No, we can't.  I can't fly.  What am I?  Let's see.  All right, let's.  No, I can fly in a plane.  Yeah, let's open a window and see if you can fly, please.  Because a plane, you're not looking, it's not a, I couldn't fly in a glass plane, probably. 
[00:27:00]  That would, none of us could.  Why?  It would come apart.  But how cool would that be?  That'd be pretty fucking cool.  Sam, you know what?  Your best idea yet.  Glass plane.  I feel like Wonder Woman's invisible plane.  But can you imagine going like New York to LA in a glass plane?  How cool that would be.  You're just fucking looking around like, ah, ah, the whole time.  The floor has to be glass and the sides.  Yeah.  Everything else, whatever.  You would be out of, would you be out of your mind? 
[00:27:30]  It'd be so fucking cool.  It would be really cool.  Jesus.  It would be scary as all fuck.  Right.  Yeah.  But it would be cool.  But even if you knew it was going to be okay, I still wouldn't enjoy it.  But what about, ah.  I still have panic attacks.  What about like a bombardier in like a B-17 where they had to squeeze into that glass  nose cone, the little nose, and they were like leaning right in that thing.  But their feet were on the ground, like on, well, they were kind of laying down.  I mean, you know, yeah.  Yeah.  Part of the plane that didn't have glass.  Yeah.  But you're, you're pretty much looking.  It's all glass around you. 
[00:28:00]  That's easy.  I could do that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I feel like you, cause you're tucked in nice and tight.  Yeah.  What about a waste gunner where there's no window or anything?  You're just an opening on the side of the plane with a machine gun.  It's very cold, but it's open.  I did that once in a Cessna.  Did you?  They took the door off so I could film his car dealership.  Oh, and you got sick.  The famous story.  Well, not famous, but I haven't told it in a while.  I used to shoot local commercials and a guy had a dealership.  He's like, you're, you're, you're good as far as flying in Cessnas and stuff, aren't 
[00:28:30]  you?  I'm like, oh yeah, man.  Never been in one in my life.  They strapped me in.  They took the door off so I could get some good, you know, video of his car dealership  from above.  And I, I would, I was trying to focus the camera and between that and, and being in a  small Cessna that was making some pretty good moves, I got so fucking sick that I couldn't  even look in the viewfinder anymore.  And I was just shooting video praying that I got the dealership.  No way you could look into a viewfinder.  No.  That's the perfect fucking storm for puking. 
[00:29:00]  And it's old school where you had to go, you know, close one eye and open the other  obviously.  Wow.  Like nowadays with your phone, you know, if you, if you're holding it out or some of these  other cameras, I could have done that.  Right.  And look at the picture on this little screen, but this guy is doing turns and dipsy doodles.  He's, he's thinking, you know, that I'm, I'm shooting some amazing shit and I'm in the  back just like, just praying I'm getting something.  And as soon as he landed, I go, I'll be right back.  He goes, all right, how was that?  I'm like, oh, it was great. 
[00:29:30]  I'll be right back.  I went behind the plane and just started puking.  And then I went back to the, uh, the little TV studio I used to work at in, uh, where the  fuck was I in, uh, Canada, right?  Yeah, whatever.  And, uh, I got, I was up there a half hour.  Maybe I got two to three seconds of usable video that I made rock.  Somehow I forget.  I got to find the commercial.  Good.  I, I lucked out and got one sweeping shot and I'm like, and I basically bullshitted my 
[00:30:00]  way through that whole experience telling the guy, this is all we need, man.  Look at this.  It's amazing.  And it's all give him too much.  And it was, it wasn't a smooth shot.  Trust me.  I got the dealership, but it was all fucking herky jerky.  Yeah.  So I have been on a plane with the side out.  Yeah.  Officially.  Yes.  Sam, would you be petrified of that, right?  I don't know.  I wasn't, I wasn't scared of that.  I just got so fucking sick.  It was kind of cool knowing you were strapped in and he was leaning the plane at everything 
[00:30:30]  and I knew I wasn't going to fall out.  Yep.  But I didn't know I was scared of heights until like a year ago.  What happened?  What?  You never went up high.  Yeah.  I never went up high.  All of a sudden you're like, I'm up high and I'm pretty fucking scared here.  There's not one of those, uh, like ski lift type things in Hershey Park.  Ski lifts rule.  I got freaked the fuck out.  What about gondolas?  I don't know.  With glass bottoms.  I don't know.  I don't think I've ever been on one.  Ski lifts rule.  Yeah.  I had no idea I was going to get freaked out.  And then I, man, almost had a panic attack on it and I couldn't look at Jess and I couldn't 
[00:31:00]  look at anything.  Oh, wow.  Were you looking at leaves?  No, I couldn't.  I had to look only at like.  Wait, the chair.  But you were taking a ski lift to look at leaves, right?  No, to look at the theme park.  It was in Hershey Park.  Oh, okay.  Gotcha.  Well, you know, sometimes those ski lifts stop.  Yeah, yeah.  And you have to climb down like rope ladders and shit.  Oh, man, yeah.  With your skis.  Well, you take your skis off, but.  Or they get stuck and, yeah, yeah.  Or you fall off of them and get caught on the edge and then you fall out of your jacket 
[00:31:30]  and hit the snow.  Some people stay there overnight because they stop the ski lift assuming everyone's off.  I saw a movie.  Will that drive you nuts?  They stopped the ski lift and they weren't coming back for a week and there were wolves  under the ski lift.  Yeah, but the wolves aren't going to get you.  Well, they were trying to get off the ski lift.  At that point, why would you get off the ski lift?  Because they were going to be there for a week and they would die.  How do you know you're going to be there for a week?  No one tells you you're going to be there for a week.  They told them before.  When the ski lift stops, you assume it's going to start up any minute.  You don't say in your mind, oh God, this is going to be a week. 
[00:32:00]  In the movie, they figured it out.  How do they figure out they're going to be there for a week?  Because they were like, oh boy, it's late at night and it's Sunday and they don't open  until next weekend.  And then they try to jump off and the wolves got them.  Well, that's a stupid ski resort.  It was a bad movie, too.  Why wouldn't they get some skiing done during the week?  I don't know.  You'd think.  They got the mountains.  So that's what got you?  You were on one of those ski lifts?  Yeah, at Hershey Park.  How high was it?  I don't know.  It wasn't even that high, I guess.  It was like a regular ski lift.  You went around the park real quick.  So it's only like 30, 40 feet in the air? 
[00:32:30]  Probably.  Yeah, you are a pussy.  You could kind of survive that fall.  I don't know.  It was petrifying.  You've got to fall the right way, though.  I think you've got to fall sort of on your side.  Something like that.  Tuck and roll.  You don't want to land on your feet.  No, your legs would shatter.  Oh, God, yeah.  Especially yours.  Those toothpicks.  You're not good.  Those cancer legs, did Jimmy call them?  That's what he called them.  That's not kind.  Well, it's not accurate.  I would fall on my shoulder and part of my left back.  I would try to fall on the small of my back.  It's flat.  How would you fall? 
[00:33:00]  With your chin tucked.  Oh, yeah.  I think that's the best way to fall.  You take it with your shoulder, right?  Sort of your shoulder slash the start of your back there.  I would do one of those paratrooper fucking things where you hit feet first, but your legs  are bent, and you kind of go over to the side, shift with your thigh and your hip, and then  go the other way and roll back on your butt and your back.  It's called a PLF.  I've never seen a PLF.  Yeah, yeah.  That's how the paratroopers. 
[00:33:30]  When do they use the PLF?  Paratroopers land like that.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, especially the old school guys with the old parachutes.  So someone figured that shit out for us.  Yeah, yeah.  Airborne.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Thank you.  There you go.  All right.  Yep, but this, um, my bro was a paratrooper.  That's how I know that there, Mr. Comic.  I'm not that amazing.  Now, see, Sam, I wouldn't jump out of a plane.  No, you'd have to be fucking nuts to do that.  And most people would say you're a pussy for not jumping out of a plane.  Well, yeah, that's right.  So we all have our limits. 
[00:34:00]  I get it.  But your limit is ridiculous.  I've made the discovery that I'll never bungee jump.  I would bungee jump.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I thought I would, but then I took that ski lift thing, and then I went up to the Sears  Tower and all that stuff, and then I know I can't handle it.  I would bungee jump.  You call the Sears Tower?  That's what we Chicagoans call it.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I thought so.  Yeah, remember the boat guy.  Sure, sure.  The boat guy said, we don't acknowledge it's the Willis Tower.  Yeah.  It'll always be the Sears Tower to us locals.  But you call it whatever you want, he says.  But it's also not a unique experience to be up there and not be able to handle that shit. 
[00:34:30]  But it's just a dumb glass box in the end.  Yeah, but the dumb glass box is 103 stories in the air.  I know it's a visual.  Just play this part.  Okay.  Is this on our Facebook page, E-Rock?  Yes, it is.  Rolling's taunting him because he's a pussy.  I got it, Sam.  Get in the glass box.  Look, he's still holding on to the side.  You're using the death grip bar.  Come on. 
[00:35:00]  Go all the way to the back.  He steps to the back.  1-100.  2-100.  That's it.  And he's back out.  Isn't that for like three seconds?  Maybe three seconds.  And now you're holding on to the bar again.  It's like me.  Oh, the bar.  Jump again.  I'm stuck.  Go ahead.  Sam, this isn't good for you.  Go ahead, man.  Oh, God.  That little fucking half-assed jumping jack.  Yeah, I had to get out of there.  Jump.  It was a jumping fag.  That's even rhyme. 
[00:35:30]  I know.  Jumping Bruce.  And then Roland starts jumping and then realizes, what scared you about that?  I like down.  Yeah, looking down, it's crazy.  When you jump up, you're like, dang, the glass is so clean.  You're like, ah.  Why?  It's a glass box.  You're safe.  But would you do the helicopter?  Oh, a little sarcasm.  I like that.  Huh?  It's sarcasm.  I said, why?  It's a glass box.  You're safe.  Yeah, but I think more people think like Roland than you.  What?  Well, all right.  Some of the fear pops into your head. 
[00:36:00]  But I, you know, I get some of the fear popping into your head.  Yeah.  Some.  Plus, you didn't do any tricks.  You were Mr. Behind the Camera Bully.  I was in the box for pretty much the whole time we're up there.  No, no.  That's outside the box.  All this video is you, Mr. Outside the Box, taunting others.  There's the latest video.  There's me standing in the fucking sky deck, and then I point my camera down at my shoes.  What are you talking about?  I got a picture of my shoes in there, but I was only there, like you said, for three seconds. 
[00:36:30]  You're not going to win this one.  I know you're good at spinning shit and shit stirring and all that, but this one makes you look really bad.  It's not.  No, it doesn't.  Yeah, it does.  Because it's a 103 story.  As a matter of fact, I was split down the middle on the responses to this video.  Many people saying, I wouldn't even go in that thing.  Fear of heights is not.  The girls, right?  The girls.  Sure.  Some females.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fear of heights is not an uncommon thing.  The very effeminate men, right?  All the ones.  Yeah.  And then, like, the real people, men and stuff, they were saying, ah, you're a pussy. 
[00:37:00]  No, they didn't say that.  The only of the guys who wanted to impress L.P.  E-Rock was saying it.  Oh, Jesus.  E-Rock.  Still just yearning for that hero thing.  E-Rock, say I'm a pussy or what?  Yeah, he comes off bad.  What were you reading?  Newsweek?  What were you doing?  Perusing Time Magazine?  What were you doing?  Loading the new FU line.  What does that take?  A minute.  Oh, man. 
[00:37:30]  A couple seconds?  Yeah, the minute that you happened to call on me.  I know.  It happens a lot.  It's really strange.  Thank you, Andy.  Every time.  Every time.  But you get people that are scared of heights, but Sam takes it way over the top of that.  That was way over the top.  I freaked out when I looked down, but then after a few moments, I'm like, all right.  And I just kind of bullshit myself into walking onto it, and then I was fine.  Right.  But yeah, holding onto the building.  Look at that, Ant.  This is a group shot of us in the sky deck, but this is E-Rock.  Of course.  God, I wish I had the solo shot.  That's really cool. 
[00:38:00]  That does look fucked up.  Did it turn into the leaning tower of Pisa when it did that?  Now, I'll take it to the next level.  Now, the Grand Canyon has that skywalk.  Yeah.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Which I believe is way higher, I would assume.  I don't know.  It's the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere.  Oh, the Grand Canyon is.  What, the Grand Canyon?  No, that's not a building.  Ask Indians.  They'll say different. 
[00:38:30]  What is it, like a semi-circle?  Yeah, it's like a horseshoe.  It's like a little horseshoe that sticks out over the lip of the canyon.  A rim.  That would be fucked up.  Mm-hmm.  See, now I'm kind of with you, Sam.  That would be fucked up.  I would do it, but I think that would start really playing with my fucking mind.  Yeah, I don't know how that would be.  You got to wear little booties.  Yeah.  So you don't scratch it up because it's very dusty and dirty there.  They had no problem with, like, your shoes?  Did they make you wipe your feet or something?  They probably should make you take your shoes off, but the glass was pristine and didn't scratch. 
[00:39:00]  I didn't see any scratches, really.  Yeah, they used a different kind of glass, they said, than the Grand Canyon does because  they knew, because they wanted the best user experience possible.  Ooh.  So they used, like, a thicker, non-scratch type of glass at the bottom.  Crazy glass.  Right.  Wow.  That's why you could see, like, the sides are a little bit more clear than the bottom  is.  Yeah.  Because that way, because they use that non-scratch type of stuff.  Yeah.  Pretty fucking cool.  Do you know a lot about it for being such a pussy?  I learned. 
[00:39:30]  Kind of wimpy.  Yeah.  Not good.  I'm fine with it.  Come across on the air as a real, real go-getter, a tough guy.  Is that what it is?  Because I've had such a, I've had a tough guy persona for so long, you're going to take  a shit from anybody.  I don't like shaking John Wayne.  Yeah.  That's what it's been like, huh?  Yeah.  I took joy in the fact that you showed some weakness.  I've shown weakness before.  You rarely show weakness, because my mother wouldn't approve.  Well, I don't have a lot of weakness in me.  Mother wouldn't approve.  I'm an extraordinarily strong person, but. 
[00:40:00]  Rollercoasters?  Yep.  I love rollercoasters.  They're scary, but I'll go on.  Used to hate them.  Now I don't mind them.  Yeah.  I was a wimpy kid.  I didn't go on the rollercoasters.  I'll go on most rollercoasters.  The rest of my brothers went, and I would do it once, and then I would be sitting on  the side on that dumb bench waiting for everybody.  But then something changed, and I don't mind them now.  Rollercoasters, eh?  Yeah, I'm not that fucking, I don't know.  I'm not that into rollercoasters.  What, your pussy? 
[00:40:30]  Hell, fucking go in a box if I wasn't, you know, gambling.  I think, yeah, you're doing, I think rollercoasters are way scarier than that Skydeck box.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't think so.  Definitely.  You, you're, it's not logical.  I know it's not logical, and fear isn't logical.  It's fear.  I mean, there's a hundred percent guarantee that nothing is going to happen to you in that  Skydeck box.  That's not a hundred percent.  At the Will's Tower, Chicago.  It's like a 99.999 percent.  Rollercoaster, every fucking summer, someone's biting it. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  Did we get one yet this summer?  I don't think so.  I haven't heard any, uh.  It might be good this summer, then.  Yeah.  Yeah, but still, it's just, it's not, that's what I'm saying.  I'm not scientifically looking at statistics.  I'm looking at how does this make me feel.  When you go up on one of those rollercoasters that go way the fuck up.  I don't like rollercoasters.  And then you're looking at the sky, next thing you know, it makes the turn to start going down.  I just kind of don't like the ones that go upside down. 
[00:41:30]  I like old, like.  Oh, no, I like the ones that go upside down because you feel like you're really strapped in nice.  I like the craziest ones where you feel like you're going to be thrown out at any minute.  You're like, I think I could really get flung right out of this thing.  I don't like the old school ones where the dumb bar comes down and no one checks it.  And you're like, oh, is this much?  What about, there's no protection up near my shoulders?  There's always just some fucking low life.  Just, yeah.  Right.  Just pressing those stupid air buttons.  Oh, God. 
[00:42:00]  All right, have a good ride.  And just assume.  Yeah, they just assume.  No one knows what the fuck they're doing.  Yeah.  All right.  I like those, though.  They're kind of fucking fun.  Yeah.  Just not a big, like, wild, all over, upside down, sideways thing.  I like a good fast rollercoaster that kind of, you know, has some whoop-dee-doos and whatnot.  But I'm not a big upside down guy.  I don't like the ones where your feet dangle.  Why?  You don't like those either?  Nah, I don't really like those.  Like the flying Superman kind of things? 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, I like the sitting ones.  No, I'm more scared of the sitting ones.  Really?  Yeah, I think so.  I like when my feet dangle, because you're all strapped in nice.  Yeah.  Although you wonder if your feet are going to just be chopped off.  Right.  But that goes back to my point that they made sure your feet aren't going to be chopped off.  But you worry that your feet are going to be chopped off.  Yes.  I'm saying there is some type of fear in this shit.  Right.  But then logically, you get past it.  That's what makes it all exciting.  Right.  Have you seen the skywalk in Toronto? 
[00:43:00]  Where they lean out?  Where you walk around.  I would do that.  With no gates or nothing.  I would.  No, they have a harness on it.  They have a harness, but nothing there.  What happened?  What is that thing?  Oh my God, I don't know.  What is that?  Teenage tech visionary.  Taylor Wilson.  It still could be a girl.  Taylor Wilson.  Oh my God.  I don't know what that is.  It's the most androgynous thing I've ever seen.  Whatever it is, it's not going to prom.  Taylor looks like a very young David Bowie. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  David Bowie-ish.  When David Bowie didn't really have features, where everything just kind of was washed out.  Yeah, like an alien.  Not quite cooked yet.  Holy fuck.  So odd.  The CN Tower has this glass thing, but it's just on the floor.  Yeah.  Inside.  It doesn't extend out.  Like the Willis Tower, that was pretty crazy.  It's a great idea.  I think the floor thing would be, if it were just a floor, it would be a little easier.  Than actually going outside.  Sure.  You know what they should have?  They should have the floor, but every so often, it's not there. 
[00:44:00]  So, and it's like nice and clear, and then people just walk out and fall, plummet to  their death.  So you never know.  You never know.  That would be really frightening.  How great would it be if like, you know, the world was different.  The world was different.  Yeah.  Start with that.  That's different.  And yeah, you go to one of these things, and one day a year, there's no glass, but they  don't tell you when.  They don't tell you.  Everything was Russian roulette.  Right.  Yes.  Everything in life is Russian roulette.  And they only allow one person to plummet. 
[00:44:30]  Would you still do it?  Would you take the odds?  What's the upside?  Just enjoying the experience?  Just knowing that that's a possibility.  Maybe that, I don't know, fucking gets you going inside.  How about like, yeah, that, and on a highway, like somewhere, on a highway, like a giant  iron wall just flings up out of nowhere in the middle of the road.  But they only take out one car a year.  Slams into it.  They take out one car a year.  Yeah, that's it.  That'd make life pretty exciting.  Fucking be wild every time. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, you just don't know.  You don't know what the fuck's going to happen.  That would be a hell of a way.  Imagine how stressful your life would be.  Just all the time.  That's just always wondering.  Checking the paper to see if the big fucking metal wall came up last night.  It came up.  It'd be like Hunger Games, but always.  Always.  Yeah.  Constantly.  You might die at any moment.  The odds are just fucking really, really slim, but hey, it's got to happen to somebody.  Right.  One person dies a day.  The government kills one person a day. 
[00:45:30]  In some weird fucking way.  Government kills one person a day.  Or one vehicle.  In crazy ways.  And you just look at the paper to see how did they do it last night.  Oh, man.  That'd be cool.  It's only 365 people a year.  That's not bad.  And you're listening to the radio hoping the death announcement comes, so that way the  rest of the day you're cool.  Right.  You're like, oh.  Yeah, they announce when it happened immediately.  Right.  On all the social networking.  So then you can breathe a sigh of relief, like, okay, I'm good for the rest of today. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  But it's one a day.  One a day.  You'd just be like, oh, no.  Today.  You'd fucking wake up and you're like, oh, do I even go out?  But in creative ways, it happens.  Yeah, yeah.  And then they film it for TV.  Yeah.  And you couldn't just stay at home because they might drop a giant boulder on your house.  Oh, no.  It's not guaranteed that you're safe if you stay home.  No, they have giant house-sized boulders that they crush house in there.  Or whatever.  Whatever it was like.  Like a fucking wrecking ball comes through your window.  Dump truck at 80 miles an hour just plows into your bedroom. 
[00:46:30]  But that's the beauty of it.  They're so creative with how they do this.  Yes.  No one's safe.  Right.  Yeah, I like it.  And then it could be a simple thing.  Like, oh, yeah, today they just poisoned someone's Starbucks.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, really?  I can't even get a cup of coffee.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you're just drinking Starbucks and some guy's just.  Right.  And just fucking.  And then the government tricks you and you go, well, obviously I could get coffee today.  But they killed two people in a row at Starbucks.  Oh, man.  To really fuck with your mind. 
[00:47:00]  Like, ah, shit.  And then you go, wait, will they go for three days in a row?  Nah, they couldn't possibly go for three days in a row.  And then they do.  And then they do.  Everybody's going to Dunkin' Donuts and then they're.  But then they fuck with the jelly.  Cyanide and the munchkins.  Yes.  Yes.  And the munchkins.  How great would that be?  That would make your life really exciting.  I love it.  But just so stressful.  Huh?  Everybody would be bald.  No, I think, you know.  Stress.  Yeah.  I think in a way.  I think in a way you'd be really into it.  Yeah.  Everybody would just be competitive.  Yeah.  Because every day you're like, okay, where did it happen today and how did it happen? 
[00:47:30]  You go to like the dentist and he just fucking.  Right.  Shoots you up with poison or some shit.  Yeah.  Drill something in your head.  Yeah.  Then the people.  I saw that car this morning.  Oh, that smallest car?  Yeah.  It's on Fox and Friends right now.  It went zipping by us as we were coming in.  Yeah.  Hold on a minute because we'll get back to the government thing.  But I wanted to show you this.  There's nothing I could do with this.  It didn't.  Oh, you took a picture?  Well, there's nothing.  It was driving right next to us on the way in this morning. 
[00:48:00]  Look how tiny that fucking car is.  Tiny little bubble car thing.  That thing stinks.  Dude, it's horrifying.  Yeah.  I guess it's the world's smallest car.  Adam Farrar.  Who was the other guy?  Oh, yeah.  He was great on the radio yesterday.  Rutledge what?  Rutledge.  Thank you.  I'm like, Ryan.  Yeah, those guys were a lot of fun yesterday.  And the small cars on Fox and Friends.  That thing looks horrifying.  Yeah.  When you see it actually on the road. 
[00:48:30]  Why would you drive that thing?  But anyway, the fuck was I going to say?  Oh, yeah.  So the government.  So even the people you know, all of a sudden they could be the ones, man.  So you're not even safe just hanging out with your friends.  It could be anyone.  It could just be as simple as going and pushing the button across the street and flames shoot  out of it.  Oh, man.  And then you're on fire.  That's pretty creative.  Oh, shit.  You're like, oh, I'm on fire.  Yeah, this is awful.  I'm the guy today.  I'm the guy.  I'm only seven.  I don't want to be the guy. 
[00:49:00]  You get in an elevator and all of a sudden it just fucking plummets.  Plummet.  We're going down.  Yeah.  Plummets.  Just plummets.  Oh, you're done.  You have to make sure you're always not the only one in the elevator because it's just  one a day.  So if there's multiple people in the elevator, you're probably okay.  Yeah.  Probably not.  What if all of a sudden a sword comes out from the wall and skewers one person?  That would be pretty goddamn good.  And then you're like, fuck, not even in an elevator with other people?  Look at that.  Or the elevator just opens on a random floor and a mafia hitman just walks in and shoots 
[00:49:30]  you.  Right.  It could be as simple as that.  Yeah, because it's not illegal if the government is doing this.  They sanctioned the mafia hitman.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  Oh, that's a brutal way to go through life.  But man, I think we might have just wrote a movie.  Yeah.  I think we just wrote a fucking movie.  Yeah.  It's been done.  I guess so.  It's technically The Hunger Games, but it's your whole life and everyone for no reason.  For no fucking reason.  Just to get things heated up a little. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Just to make it exciting.  It's also like Running Man a little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit of Running Man in there.  But it's not a game.  It's life.  It's just life.  Did they redo Running Man?  I don't think.  I mean, they've used the plot.  Total Recall.  Total Recall.  Total Recall.  That's a bust.  Yeah.  I liked Running Man.  I don't know if it holds up.  I remember at the time.  Running Man's fun.  Any Arnold movies are fucking hilarious to watch.  Yeah.  The old ones are great.  Well, they got the second movie that, what was it called? 
[00:50:30]  Expendables.  Expendables.  Oh, God.  That just looks like a joke.  And Arnold says, I'll be back.  Yeah.  Why does he have to do his catchphrases every movie now?  Plus, there's a different movie.  People love it.  Do they?  No, they hate it.  I guess they do.  You know what's fucked up, though?  That looks like it could have been a sketch from years ago.  Like, what would happen if all the action stars were old?  Yeah.  Because I was watching the trailer for it, and it's like, oh, God.  It's over the top, hokey. 
[00:51:00]  Like, you know.  I didn't even see the first one.  Was the first one good?  No.  It was all right?  Well, it was good enough for them to make a second one.  Bigger, better, better than the first one.  Stone Cold was it.  Stone Cold was it.  He's fucking stunning people.  We got Randy Couture this time.  Sly.  Jason Statham.  Yep.  Oh.  Does he drive a car real fast?  Super fast.  Of course he does.  He's Jason Statham.  Jean-Claude Van Damme.  Oh, well.  Chuck fucking Norris is in this one.  And Frank Stallone does the soundtrack.  Frank Stallone does the soundtrack. 
[00:51:30]  Does the song.  What a loser.  Zoiks.  That's piss poor.  Let's see this.  Lionsgate.  Not them.  Stuntmen.  They're zip lining.  Wait.  Oh, come on.  A-team fucking Jeep flip.  Where's the comedy?  Here comes the comedy.  Here comes the comedy.  Loaded. 
[00:52:00]  Oh.  Time to reload.  Somebody's hooked.  And I pronounce you.  Man and Knife.  Oh, man and Knife.  That's a good one.  They just sit in a room trying to think of catchphrases.  You and your little psychotic gang of Mutzler as well as the guys.  This trailer's telling me nothing.  Good thing.  Yeah, I guess you're right.  The threat is this great.  It spawns a pure plutonium. 
[00:52:30]  It's powerful enough to charge.  Oh, man.  Come on.  Imagine what five tons would do.  Wham, bam, van, dam.  A lot of explosions.  I need more men if you expect to get out of here alive.  I'm back.  Oh.  Are you, Arnold?  The contents of that safe fall into the wrong hands.  Chuck Norris.  Terrible plan.  Dolph Lundgren.  Find him, kill him.  That was Dolph?  Yeah.  Dolph Lundgren. 
[00:53:00]  Here we go.  All right.  Oh, they're kicking ass all over the place.  In the air, in the water, on the land.  Look, here he is.  Hey.  Hey.  His shoe is bigger than this car.  Shoe, something.  Oh, it's funny.  They're in a small car.  Sylvester Stallone looks so weird.  I can't fucking.  It's distracting how odd he looks. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  He looks odd.  Expendables, too.  Oh, and they just put their last names up there.  Hemsworth.  That's a lot of noise.  Nicolas Cage is doing the third one.  They're making a third one already?  Yeah.  Nicolas Cage.  They're incredibly successful.  This one didn't even come out yet.  Yeah.  Was the first one good?  Yeah.  I didn't see it, but I hear that they're just exactly what they're meant to be.  Just a mindless, fun action movie that you just, you know. 
[00:54:00]  The Rock could kick the shit out of all those guys.  Maybe The Rock can still be the third one.  The Rock, you know, The Rock is almost there.  Visually, it looked.  Come on.  Oh, getting a little older, you mean?  Yeah.  He's only got a couple matches left in him.  There was a lot of, you know, stunts and explosions.  It's just supposed to be.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Explosions.  What are you doing?  What the fuck?  Why do we have to try to hate everything?  It looks like it's a lot of work to just hate everything.  It's exhausting.  It's just Slot.  Did you see this?  Like Sylvester Stallone's face.  It's exhausting. 
[00:54:30]  It's so weird to look at.  He's had a bunch of plastic surgery or something.  He stretched and pulled him.  And the eyebrows are doing something weird.  Yeah, I don't.  What's going on there?  We're looking at this movie like, oh, well, this isn't going to be picked for the Oscars.  It is what it is, I guess.  You go and fucking check out some explosions.  Exactly.  Arnold definitely looks old, though.  Yeah, the action stars are aging.  Chuck Norris and Arnold and Sly.  Chuck Norris is in his 70s.  They're not young men.  He's in his 70s.  Chuck Norris is in his 70s.  Wow.  Arnold's got to be pushing 70 at this point. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, he's in his 60s.  And Sly's got to be in his 60s easily.  Yep.  Jean-Claude's not a young man.  No.  Why is he there?  He's like the villain.  These guys aren't spring chickens.  Why didn't they ask, what's his name?  Fucking Fatso.  Eric?  Oh.  I love how I just sent that right up.  Such a crutch.  Such a crutch, he said.  Steven Seagal.  Steven Seagal.  Steven Seagal.  Oh, yeah.  They talked about it in the first one.  They just said he was an asshole. 
[00:55:30]  That's why nobody asked him.  Was that it?  Yeah.  Probably because he's a police officer.  He's got a real career.  I'm a police officer.  Mm-hmm.  Wow, man.  That's fucked up.  So that's that.  Stallone, 66.  Nars is 72.  Jesus.  Arnold is 65.  Bruce Willis is 57.  Yep.  And they're running around the jungle.  Fucking just wailing with fucking machine guns that are meant to be mounted on something.  They've got miniguns in their fucking hands.  What?  And they're fucking, you know, 70. 
[00:56:00]  How do they carry all that stuff in the woods?  There's no way.  They get so tired in real life.  I don't know.  You think?  They would need so many rests.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, that sounds good, though.  But check out Sam is a Pussy on our Facebook page, please, and then make your own opinion  on it.  Yeah.  Him in the Sky Deck in Chicago at the Willis Tower.  Yeah.  Good experience.  I was talking to the main guy there.  He goes.  I almost had him, too.  He's like, oh, we got, oh, we got plans.  We got big plans. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, like what?  I go, like, what?  Exactly.  And he's like, oh, I can't tell you.  I go, like, zip lines.  Oh, that'd be nice.  My dream of zip lining from building to building.  That'd be sick.  I go, like, zip lines.  And his eyes got wild.  Oh, you think, man?  But I think it's going to be probably more of that, like, CN Tower thing where you're outside  the building, maybe on a pulley system or, I mean, you know, on a thing.  But I don't know.  Yeah.  He wouldn't give up the info, but he's like, we have just begun.  Wow.  Yeah, there's other things they're going to do. 
[00:57:00]  I don't think I'm going to go any further than the boxes.  What?  I don't think I'm going to go any further than those boxes.  You barely did that.  Exactly.  You didn't do that.  You officially didn't do that.  I was in there.  It was on the video.  I guess you were.  Plus, there's a picture of me in there, so.  I guess you were.  Let's not go crazy.  He was wimpy, right?  Yeah, a little wimpy.  Yeah.  I mean, it's pretty safe.  Would you bungee jump?  No, I wouldn't bungee jump.  No?  Really?  Have you bungee jumped?  No, but I would love to.  I would bungee jump.  Crazy, you're a father.  I did that thing at like Six Flags. 
[00:57:30]  You're crazy, you're a father.  What about your child?  Exactly.  I'd take the subway through Brooklyn at three in the morning.  You're right.  It's so good to know that no one gives a fuck about my life, because I certainly am a father  and have a child as well.  Well, you're a little more responsible than the likes of Travis Teft.  I'm talking about a little bit.  Very responsible.  Oh, I like that.  Because you just said he would bungee jump.  I said I would bungee jump.  I said I would.  I didn't say I'm going right now.  You're crazy.  You're a father.  I don't think either of you two's would bungee jump.  Why?  Set it up.  I'll do it tomorrow. 
[00:58:00]  You're all talk.  I'll be scared.  I'll be scared.  I'm not going to be that guy like, oh, it's no big deal.  But I would do it.  I'll talk.  I would not skydive.  That would be rough.  Travis didn't mean.  I would skydive with the army.  Not with those.  Oh, God.  I'm sorry.  Not with those dopes out on Long Island.  Out east on Long Island, I skydive.  Malfunction.  And now I'm going to get fucking hate.  Eh, fuck them.  But it just doesn't seem safe.  If it was the army or something, I'm like, all right. 
[00:58:30]  Go at like the fucking, you know, the knights or something.  Yeah.  West Point guys.  Yeah.  Fucking jump out of that motherfucker.  Yeah, I don't want to do any of their fancy tricks.  Just get me to the ground.  No, you just get to the ground.  But some of these like, you know, oh, we take off from Calverton and yeah, we fly around  a little.  It's cool.  And then there's like beers when we hit the ground.  Oh, fuck no.  Oh, boy.  That's one thing where I need to know.  These guys fucking take it extremely seriously. 
[00:59:00]  You can watch the safety video if you want, but you know what?  No one's looking.  Pussies look at that.  Right.  It's all right.  So Sam would watch the video.  We're going to get a good view of the Long Island game farm now as we come around before  we jump.  Would you do that?  No.  And you know, it's not fair to them.  I'm sure they have a very good safety record.  Yeah, fuck.  It's just something about it.  All right.  Time to sign your life away.  Yeah.  You're ready to jump, right?  You did the hour course. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, boy.  I've sounded like a fucking pussy myself.  No.  You said you'd bungee jump.  He just said, yeah, I'd bungee jump.  Then I'd jump out of a plane and then I'd shoot a bunch of bad guys, too.  Oh.  We're just talking, right?  Yeah.  Just talking.  I mean, a week ago, I would have said.  I told you that I wouldn't skydive, but I would bungee jump.  That's a real fucking thought.  All right.  Well, me too, then.  No, you wouldn't, though.  Me too, then.  Yeah, me too, then.  You know, I would almost rather skydive, though, because I don't like how you bounce back with 
[01:00:00]  the bungee cord thing.  It seems like it would hurt.  That does seem like, oh, I made it.  Oh, shit, I'm fucked again.  Oh, I made it.  Oh, shit, I'm fucked again.  I would imagine that would really fuck up my back.  Yeah.  Can I wear a back harness?  So maybe I'd skydive instead.  Plus, I'll talk Travis didn't even make it to the elevator of the Sears Tower.  No, I didn't go.  Exactly.  You're scared.  I went home.  Puss boy.  No, he went to Wrigley or something.  He did his own gum.  Everyone was doing that.  I woke up earlier.  I went to Wrigley.  Ooh. 
[01:00:30]  Exciting.  Gum.  It wasn't for me.  Mr. Action Packed.  See, Sam, you just suck.  No, I don't.  Because you go, ooh, exciting.  But that's what we would say about your dumb wrestling.  Everyone has their thing.  I was comparing it to going up top.  I was comparing it to being scared.  I can't understand going to a stadium.  You're right.  But I mean, there's people out there, if they go to a new city, they want to just go check  out the ballpark.  But it's not action packed.  If we had more time, I would have gone because I got a text from Danny saying, hey, Ope's going  to the Willis Tower.  You want to go?  And I was on the way home from Wrigley. 
[01:01:00]  I was like, I really don't think we can make it.  Yes, gum.  Gum.  Gum, Anthony.  Just waiting for an acknowledgement.  Wrigley moved out.  They went to Chicago, that building.  There's a building called the Wrigley Building, but they don't make the gum there anymore.  They don't make the gum?  No, there's new tenants in that building.  We learned that on our rom-com boat tour.  Yeah, we did.  A rom-com boat tour, my ass.  That's what Roland called it.  I know, Roland.  That's all the rom-com sites.  You're silly.  See, we're still talking about Chicago days later.  Oh, it was a wonderful city. 
[01:01:30]  It really was.  They got over there.  Chicago.  It was fucking nice, right?  And then we were talking about Cleveland two days later.  Well, we were, but it wasn't very...  Well, not fondly.  It wasn't very flattering.  Cleveland, you know, it's got a different vibe.  Yeah.  Good people.  Good people.  Good people.  Like a cemetery vibe.  Sorry.  We've got to figure out where we're going next.  Hmm.  Hmm.  A lot of people tweeting their suggestions.  A lot of them can go fuck themselves.  Yeah, all their suggestions are their towns.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:02:00]  It's where they live.  Yeah.  I want to go Pacific Northwest.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I want to go to, like, Portland or Seattle.  Vancouver.  That's what I was thinking.  Seattle might be fun.  That corner would be fucking cool.  Yeah.  I don't even know if we have fans out there.  Who the fuck knows?  It's cool.  Now we should really just...  A bunch of Bigfoot show up there.  Fuck it.  We should base where we want to go.  Attack.  Some, like, landmarks.  Huh?  I know.  On cool things to do.  If fans show up, that's cool, too.  I was thinking that.  We should go to the Grand Canyon.  Yeah, sure.  Let's do a show on Arizona.  Is there people around there? 
[01:02:30]  Who knows?  We've got, like, the Hopi Indians, I think.  Some Indians are out there.  We can do a show for them.  They have booze.  I need to get back to the Grand Canyon.  That is the most amazing fucking place on earth.  I would like to see that.  It's ridiculous.  It is grand.  Is it?  We'll say.  It is.  That's pretty fucking big.  You can't even describe that size.  And you can't take a picture and show anybody or film or anything.  You've got to be standing there and look at it and just go, holy fuck.  You've seen it?  Yeah.  What about a pano? 
[01:03:00]  You could take a pano.  Nope.  No?  Doesn't translate.  Is it bigger?  You have to see that fucking thing.  Is it vast?  Vast.  Is that it?  We took a.  Very good.  As opposed to, like, slow.  Would you take a helicopter over the Grand Canyon?  Um, we did that.  That was kind of, kind of, kind of cool and scary at the same time.  Oh, shit.  It was kind of scary.  It was kind of scary.  It was constantly plowing into the.  You would fly to the Grand Canyon, right?  I've never been in a helicopter, so I don't know.  The helicopter takes off. 
[01:03:30]  It's a whirly bird.  Helicopter takes off maybe two miles from the, you know, the actual rim or whatever.  Yeah.  And you're just barely above the tree line, and all of a sudden, you're over the rim,  and it just drops the fucking line.  Just gone, right?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Yeah, you're like, what?  And there's nothingness.  Because when you're in a helicopter low to the ground, even though if that crashed,  you'd still be fucked, but you just feel safer.  And then all of a sudden, that tree line went away, and there's the rim, and next thing  you know, you're over this fucking massive, massive site. 
[01:04:00]  I loved it.  How did they like the Chicago pizza?  I liked the Chicago pizza, Mike.  I didn't have any.  They had some at the gig.  I ate at that Harry Carey's.  So did we.  We ate there.  It was so goddamn good.  Did you have the pasta?  I had the surf and turf.  Lobster tail, that was like, usually when you get that, you're like, oh boy, you're always  chippy on the lobster tail.  These fucking lobster tails are huge.  Huge.  Great.  You can't make a mean chicken sandwich, too.  Of course they do.  If I can put out a recommendation.  Of course they do. 
[01:04:30]  Did you see the plastic, like fiberglass?  The bowl with the big Harry Carey glasses on it?  Yeah.  How great is that?  Hilarious.  Roland came out of the side and goes, hey look, they got a cow that looks like Harry  Carey.  Roland kept doing really bad.  Will Ferrell doing Harry Carey impressions.  Oh yeah, that's what everybody's Harry Carey impressions is.  Can I hear one?  Harry Carey.  What the fuck was that? 
[01:05:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Roland's a lot of fun when he's away from microphones.  It's really strange.  He comes alive, man.  He was fucking with everyone on our rom-com.  Yeah.  We wave at them, then we brush them off.  Brush them off.  Yeah.  I don't know if that'll translate for the radio show, but at the time it was very funny.  He's great.  You know what I noticed?  We make fun of everyone that comes to New York and does all touristy, Times Square-y  shit.  And that's what we did in Chicago.  And you did the exact same thing.  That was my point.  That's what we did in Chicago.  Oh yeah, yeah.  We did everything that we make fun of people for doing. 
[01:05:30]  That's what I was saying yesterday.  Because I'm sure there's a cool side of Chicago that tourists just don't have any clue about.  That was my point about going to the art museum for Ferris Bueller and the Married  with Children fountain.  Oh boy.  You don't go to bullshit in New York.  Why would you go to bullshit in Chicago?  Tourist to Iraq.  But I think I'm going to start going to bullshit in New York.  I've never been to the Statue of Liberty.  Iraq the tourist.  And I got a guy that will give us the inside tour of the Statue of Liberty.  The inside poop.  The really good tour that no one really gets.  So we've got to hook that up.  Have some lunch at Bubba Gump. 
[01:06:00]  And I've never been to the top of the Empire State Building.  Neither have I.  Top of the Rock is better.  I went there.  Top of the Rock is much better.  Why is Top of the Rock better?  The Empire State Building is the Empire State Building.  But you have to walk upstairs, straight up elevator, and you're out there.  Who cares about walking up a few flights of stairs?  It's higher.  It's fucking people.  For windows.  Yeah.  Isn't Empire State Building is way higher?  Yeah.  You can still see it from Top of the Rock.  They do promote Top of the Rock.  Like it's this big fuck.  I haven't done that either.  That's a block away from here, right? 
[01:06:30]  Top of the Rock.  They were fucking happy when the towers went down.  Gave them business.  Jesus.  Windows on the world.  Remember that place?  Yep.  That was great.  I ate there like two months before.  See, I almost got killed over there.  Two months.  Two months.  You guys ever been to the top of the Trade Center two months before it happened?  You guys ever been to the K building?  What?  The K building.  Where is the K building?  It's in New Rochelle, Westchester.  Oh, God.  How big is the K building?  It's like five stories.  No, I mean, it's probably 30 stories up. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, you see that K from wherever you are in New Rochelle.  New Rochelle.  They built some Trump.  Are you going to spend your whole life up there?  The only way I like it is if they build two more right next to it.  They built some Trump apartment buildings.  They're a little taller than the K building.  That must make you mad.  Yeah, the K building.  Takes the thunder away.  Yeah, I didn't like that.  So I guess they cleaned up the blood, speaking of Times Square.  The paper's making a big deal about the fact that the blood was still there 
[01:07:30]  after the cops shot the guy in front of everybody.  Yeah, they had like ghoulish people that were kind of looking and taking pictures  next to the blood spots on the sidewalk.  Yeah, why not?  I'd walk by to see where the guy got shot in broad daylight.  The guy was about a piece of fucking shit in the middle of Times Square.  Fuck him.  Yeah, I would totally do that.  But they finally cleaned the blood.  I guess the paper was just sitting there waiting.  They noticed that the blood was still there.  So they were just waiting for someone to finally clean. 
[01:08:00]  And then they snap shot to the guy cleaning the blood up.  This guy had his opportunity.  Only two days later, right?  Three days later.  He had his opportunity to become a contributing member of society.  He fucked up a couple of times.  He wasn't a kid.  So fucking that's it.  Goodbye.  No one's got to worry about him.  You can't kill anybody now.  He doesn't have to fucking be on the public dole.  He doesn't have to fucking.  That's it.  It's done.  Problem solved.  And someone told me that he started his day just slashing people on the subway.  Is that true?  Really? 
[01:08:30]  Is that what you heard?  I didn't hear that one yet.  Guy was telling me at the gym yesterday.  He said, did you hear about?  And I thought, I hate the, did he hear about?  Did you hear?  People.  So, Iraq, did you see the news?  Because they're always way behind.  Yeah.  So you hear about the guy on the subway slashing people.  And I'm like, oh, fuck, another guy?  I'm thinking.  And then he told me a little more.  I'm like, oh, the guy they shot in Times Square?  I'm like, yeah, that was three days ago.  Yeah.  Where have you been?  Did I hear?  Of course I heard.  You heard?  But he's telling me that he started his day slashing people on the subway. 
[01:09:00]  Then he popped up and then he started like his nonsense in Times Square.  I think he woke up and like put his feet into his slippers on the bed, put his hands into his,  his face into his hands and was like, oh, I got to slash people today.  Oh, God.  He's all fucking like, eh, get up for work.  And then what?  Then I'm going to chase some people around with a knife in Times Square.  Smoke a joint.  Smoke a joint.  And that's where everything kind of went awry.  Yeah.  I want to ask you, did you want your waking up music? 
[01:09:30]  That's where I thought you were.  No, that's okay.  I thought it was.  No, it wasn't that bit.  Iraq was doing something.  Iraq, what were you doing over there?  I was reading the comments on our Facebook.  Why?  They'll be there.  I read questions too, also.  Hi, Iraq.  I get so bored during the show.  I read comments, but I can't do it during the show.  Oh, Iraq.  Maybe later I'll take a peek and read a few comments, but.  Iraq would be terrible like a nuclear power plant or fucking driving a plane or something.  You are Homer.  You really are.  You just have to consume constantly. 
[01:10:00]  Purple is a fruit.  You see what he's doing?  He's just consuming.  Yeah.  What were the comments?  It was about the video where Sam's a pussy.  What did they have to say?  That you're a pussy, you're the whole of the show, and Kenny gives zero fucks.  All right.  Thanks.  Someone's saying, what happened with the closed Underground Railroad system tour you were going to do?  Underground Railroad?  I don't like the sound of that.  What happened?  I want to go underground. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, literally.  Let's go underground.  Oh, see?  I thought.  Let's go underground and check some shit out.  I'm always misunderstanding things on this show.  Gee, I wonder why.  I think a cop basically told me the rats are so ridiculously big down there, and I think that scared me a little bit.  Yeah.  But you go down underground knowing there's a shitload of rats that you will see.  Yeah.  But you put those fucking booty things on that go all the way up to your knees.  They jump at your face or something like fucking headcrabs. 
[01:11:00]  Rats are scary.  Man.  They're always scary.  Yeah.  Looks like Travis isn't fearless after all.  Yeah, no.  I don't like subway rats.  You're correct.  The subway stuff that I get off here.  He's going to try to spin this all day.  You lose today, sir.  You lose.  You lose.  Every day.  Almost every day.  There's either a rat scurrying down the stairs or coming up the stairs, and you never get used to that.  It's near your place.  Oh, great.  Yeah. 
[01:11:30]  It's that one.  The rats are near my place?  Yeah.  My apartment's very nice.  Yeah, they can't get that.  It's very clean.  Wait, what line is that?  The rat line.  The AC and E line.  It's the R.  No, it's not.  I don't know.  I just jump on any fucking thing and hope for the best whenever I take the subway.  I get it.  The R line.  I've never seen a rat down there, though.  Yeah.  I see rats every day.  I've never seen a rat in the subway.  You've never seen a rat online?  I don't take the subway a lot.  Let me tell you something.  Yeah, you must not be looking at it.  But I take it enough where I should have at least seen one rat. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  I'll tell you right now.  If you're on a subway platform ten times, you will see rats five.  It's almost 50-50.  Not on the tracks, though, not on the platform.  Yeah, when I'm waiting for a subway, I will go to the edge and look at the tracks.  And I do it every time.  I'm like, all right, where's the rat today?  And I tell you, five out of ten, you're guaranteed to see a rat.  We're in their territory.  Half the time.  You want to talk about rats on a subway?  No.  Well, okay, then I'll just leave.  Motherfucking rats on the motherfucking subway. 
[01:12:30]  Danny, what's up?  They're getting so brazen these days.  They don't even just stay in the subway track area.  They'll come up onto the platforms and just look around.  And they don't care how many people are there.  They'll just go about their business.  That's pretty scary.  Is that late at night?  I see them almost every morning.  Oh, see, because you guys come in on the subways early.  So they're way more active, I think.  Did you see that video like a year ago or so of that rat that just like jumps on some  guy's face on the subway?  Oh, man.  That'd be pretty fucked up. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  Every single morning consistently at Penn Station.  Absolutely.  They're everywhere.  Every day.  I don't see them on the platforms usually.  No, very rarely.  But down in the tracks.  There are so many rats in New York.  Holy fuck.  All you have to do, really, is just stare and don't blink.  You'll see something.  Yeah.  Seriously.  For like seven seconds.  It's like looking for a shooting star.  Exactly.  And all of a sudden, you'll just kind of see something out of the corner of your eye.  Just focus on it.  Wow, it's a rat.  A rat.  Every time.  Well, I think we've said this many times, but they say there's more rats in New York 
[01:13:30]  City than people.  Yeah.  That's hard to believe.  They said, I read that book a while ago.  I reference it every once in a while.  They say, wherever you are in New York, you're within feet of a rat.  Yeah?  Yeah, when you're walking around, especially, and all that.  I bet there's not one right here.  But even in buildings and shit.  Yeah, then you wonder.  Are they behind the walls?  We'd have heard them.  But they said, as you're walking around New York, you're feet away from a rat at all  times.  On the sidewalks, all over the place.  I walk by a grocery store when I'm walking here, like a little before five in the morning. 
[01:14:00]  And that's, I mean, rats all over, especially on delivery day.  And it's a grocery store.  How are they keeping their shit clean?  All over.  What the fuck is this?  I don't know.  Oh, Travis.  Oh, Travis.  What is the rat on the guy in the subway?  Looking for a rat face.  Got rat wakes up home.  Oh, man.  That's a big rat.  Oh, shit.  About to come home with me. 
[01:14:30]  And people just lift their feet.  Those are the things I see.  They don't, they don't.  Oh, my God.  Right up in the guy's face.  It crawled right up.  It was a pretty famous video.  Most of us have seen it.  Into the guy's face.  Holy fuck.  Holy shit.  And that's like one of the brand new subway tracks.  Damn.  But you think that could be a setup?  No.  No, because that happens.  I buy it completely.  I see it.  I see it.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  I've never seen birds in the subway.  All it has to do is door open, rats in the right place at the right time. 
[01:15:00]  Those birds love taking the Staten Island Ferry.  Birds love the subway.  The ferry.  Why would they do that?  I always wonder if they're just tired.  Yeah.  I just didn't feel like flying to Staten Island.  Like, fuck it.  I'm just going to take the ferry.  It's free.  Eat some French fries.  Let me say hi to Johnny Utah in Atlanta.  Johnny Utah.  How are you guys doing?  If you like out-of-the-way tourists, out-of-the-way things to see in different cities, there's  a company called Clear Your Day that basically creates Ferris Bueller's Day Off adventures 
[01:15:30]  for people.  You fill out a questionnaire and ask you...  What do you mean, oh, God?  This is...  This would be cool.  I'm just sort of sick of the Ferris Bueller references.  Oh, yeah.  We were in Chicago.  What's wrong with you?  Because you didn't have to deal with Eric and Roland talking about Ferris Bueller all  day.  I wouldn't shut up about it.  Being a child of the 80s, that was one of the most popular movies.  I understand it was a good movie, but enough about Ferris Bueller.  Do you know the movie at all?  I love the movie.  Babes.  Sam, where would we go if we had to go and visit Stamford, Connecticut with you? 
[01:16:00]  If we did a gig in Stamford, Connecticut.  Oh, you're right.  This is where Hulk Hogan wants a slice of pizza.  Where would we miss in Stamford?  What's there to see in Stamford?  Oh, boy.  You tell me.  Hey, you're the WWE expert.  There's nothing to see in Stamford.  It's not a tourist location.  Yeah, but where would you go?  Oh, yeah.  Titan Tower.  We were just giving the Jaws 100th.  It does say 100th anniversary.  It's 100th anniversary.  Oh, universal.  Oh, okay. 
[01:16:30]  But it makes it look like it's the 100th anniversary of Jaws.  It really does.  I'm like, what the fuck?  Did we just wake up from a coma?  It's the Blu-ray.  And speaking of the first Bueller shit, when I went to Martha's Vineyard, I went to all  the Jaws locations.  Oh, well, you got to.  And it's cool as shit.  You're like, holy fuck, yeah.  It looks just like it was in the movie.  But then, like you say, we get pissed off at people that are walking around Times Square  with their video cameras.  I know.  I said it.  I do the same thing.  We're hypocrites.  I can't walk through that place.  Wow.  This site, guys.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:17:00]  You again.  I'm just saying.  If you want to do something out of the ordinary, it asks you a bunch of questions in a follow-up  interview, and then you see all these out-of-the-way things.  Can I just do something ordinary?  No, Anthony.  I don't like being out of the ordinary.  I like ordinary.  Yours would say, I want to stay away from all black people.  And that could be arranged.  What was that?  Do they have, like, packages, though, where you don't have to figure it out yourself?  And you go, oh, all right, this one looks cool.  They figure it out for you.  And if you want to do it with, like, a date, it'll make people fall in love with you. 
[01:17:30]  Basically, you could arrange that friends meet you along the way and then kind of disappear.  Whatever your interests are.  Yeah, I like that stuff.  Cool, man.  Anyway, check it out, guys.  Clearyday.com.  Clearyday.com.  Do you run the thing?  Jesus.  He might.  You never know.  That car is so stupid.  Adam Ferrara on Fox News.  Yeah, yeah.  I saw that car on the way in today.  It is not safe.  Looks like a Jetsons car.  It's horrible.  What do you think it lifts up?  It's probably battery operating. 
[01:18:00]  I'll hold it.  Here we go.  It came with a 49cc engine, and now it has a 200cc engine.  Is there air conditioning in there, Steve?  How is that?  It's like a golf cart.  That's it.  I just woke up.  Please get fucking T-boned by a can.  Is this zero to 60 in three?  This is zero to 60 in three days.  Three days, yeah.  That's really good.  It's three very hopeful days.  Just look at the size of these tires.  This thing is going to go really, really slow.  It's a three-wheel.  It was designed, let me help you out, to get through London quickly, made in the UK. 
[01:18:30]  They had a smaller version.  Of course it is.  We had that guy on yesterday.  Yeah.  They were both on.  Yeah.  And there's Adam again.  Yeah.  Very cool.  This website just does New York.  Top Gear.  What?  This website just does New York.  Let's do it.  All right.  Well, that's where we are.  Oh.  It's already here.  What could he do in New York that we don't know about?  You know how much stuff we probably haven't done that we should do in New York?  You get breakfast and then you get a shave.  And then we could do the world's largest pillow fight.  Oh, what the fuck is that? 
[01:19:00]  That sounds like fun.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Can I murder mystery walking to him?  Oh, those are the worst.  I've never done one, but murder mystery dinner.  Oh, God.  Murder mystery.  I like them if they're real.  Someone gets fucking killed.  There's always someone in your life that's like, you know, go to New Hampshire for a murder mystery.  Murder mystery.  It's a lot of fun.  A lot of fun.  It's a lot of fun.  You meet people.  You know, you're part of the action.  You help solve a murder.  Right.  And you get a dinner. 
[01:19:30]  And you get the dinner.  It's, you know, interactive.  Oh, God.  No.  Shut it.  God, no.  And that's something I'll never be talking to.  Yeah.  A murder mystery dinner theater.  Shut the door, Matt.  Oh, fuck, no.  I had to do a murder mystery dinner when I was trying to get Jess to date me.  Oh, no.  That's what she's into?  No, because her friend is like, hasn't coped with the fact that the drama club in high school is over.  And so she throws, she threw the murder mystery dinner herself where we would all be in character. 
[01:20:00]  And now you're paying her back with years of wrestling?  Exactly.  That sounds horrible.  So you had to do it?  Oh, yeah.  And what was the gist of it?  Like, where were you?  We're in the house.  You're just in her house.  And we were all around the place.  You're in her house?  So this wasn't even like a real, like...  No.  So you're not in...  She just wanted to do it.  You're not even in an old house where they say it's haunted or something?  Is Tim Curry there, at least?  Nope.  Damn.  Just in this chick's house.  And we all have our characters assigned to us.  And everybody has to, you know, have some kind of outfit that matches your character. 
[01:20:30]  And then you have to, you get cards and find out who the murderer is.  And everybody asks questions and tries to figure out everything.  It's Clue.  You play Clue at your friend's house.  Yeah, but without a board.  Yeah, it's Clue.  Like, you're the...  There's board.  Yeah.  Everybody.  But you're the character.  That sounds horrible.  It was the worst.  Just fucked.  Fuck that noise.  Nah, I don't know.  Just shan't be joining you.  Terrible way to spend anything.  Did you and Jess, like, look at each other like a boy? 
[01:21:00]  Who was the murderer again?  Where's she into it?  I don't remember.  And no.  Did you get a piece of paper where they say...  What was your character?  You're the murderer.  I think I was a hippie.  I didn't take it very seriously, though.  No, no.  You don't remember who was the murderer?  No, I don't remember.  And who gets murdered?  And who gets murdered?  I don't remember that either.  How does it work?  Do you get scripts?  Nobody move.  Nobody move.  We've had a murder.  Murder, you have to know your character and, like, come up with an alibi.  But you make it up?  Yeah, it's like improv.  Oh!  It's improv class.  I was chipping golf balls out on my lawn. 
[01:21:30]  It's just hilarious, fucking...  We should do that here with, like...  18 years ago.  Yeah, watch that.  We liked it.  Oh, yeah, let's get some comedians and we'll do a murder mystery show.  And the listeners can try to figure out who the murderer is.  Oh, that'd be great.  Yes.  That's a fun, interactive thing.  That's about to be a new channel launched on Series X.  Yeah, the murder mystery channel.  Oh, God.  They would so do that.  There's a big website attached to it, maybe.  Yeah.  That's true.  We should break.  They're sending him to the Super Bowl, too. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  Is Bob Kelly here?  Yes, he's outside.  Oh, Bobby.  He's talking to Kenny.  I swear to God, I didn't see him.  That's a lie.  Oh, I guess.  He's big.  That's what he's trying to do.  I didn't see him, for real.  I would have...  I don't look at him with his sunglasses.  Mr. Hollywood, no.  No, he's fucking Hollywood.  All right, we should break.  He's pretending we don't even know what he's here.  Ugh.  I hate when he's Hollywood.  We're going to break.  Bob Kelly's going to join the show next.  Yeah.  We do have clips from the Roseanne roast.  Should we play one going into break? 
[01:22:30]  Dan?  Yeah, you can if you want.  I mean, they're the whole set, so they're a little lengthy.  It's all right.  We did a long break just now.  I don't care.  Been on the air for an hour and a half.  Amy Schumer, Jeff Ross, or Tom Arnold?  Ooh.  Well, the Tom Arnold, it's not exactly so great.  It's not like he was really hysterically funny.  It was just like the shock value, I suppose, that he was there.  Let's do Jeff Ross.  Yeah, but Ross and Schumer, great.  So, which one?  Jeff Ross.  Yeah, do Jeff Ross.  Yeah.  Jeff Ross at the Roseanne roast. 
[01:23:00]  Is this what aired?  Yes.  This is exactly how it aired.  Did they leave the Colorado shit in there?  Oh, man.  You know what?  I don't even remember, honestly.  The Colorado thing.  No, they said that would be cut.  No, they cut that.  There was some Paterno stuff, I do believe, some Penn State stuff.  And he was dressed as Paterno the entire time as well.  All right, we'll check this out, and Bob Kelly joins us next.  Woo!  Yeah!  Fantastic!  Give it up for your host tonight, Dennis Leary.  Dennis Leary.  I see Chris is here from Glee.  This is so cool. 
[01:23:30]  I love Glee.  Jane, it's my favorite show.  It really is.  Except for the one time they let you sing.  I haven't heard sounds that disturbing since I hung out in Sandusky's basement.  Got too soon for the Glee jokes?  Folks, if you're offended by what you see tonight, just do what Joe Paterno did.  Look the other way. 
[01:24:00]  Again, Jane, thank you for hosting.  You are probably the most beloved person in comedy right now.  I mean, before the show, I even heard the crowd chanting,  Lynch!  Lynch!  Lynch!  And that was just during Wayne Brady's introduction.  Wow.  Wait, is that Wayne Brady, or did Al Jolson forget to take off his makeup?  No way.  How did you make a career out of corporate team building exercises? 
[01:24:30]  If you're just tuning in, no, this is not a Lifetime original movie.  Thank you.  Ellen Barkin, you've always been ahead of your time.  You were voted hottest woman over 50 at age 36.  Carrie Fisher, make yourself comfortable.  Chain yourself to Roseanne's chair.  What does that mean? 
[01:25:00]  I don't even get that.  It's a fucking Star Wars joke.  Oh.  I don't even get it.  You should know you're dressed like Yoda's grandma.  Yeah.  I'm telling you, this roast doesn't take commercial breaks.  It takes a menopause.  And Anthony, I'm hearing you're very excited about your new pilot, 
[01:25:30]  John Travolta.  I see the world's ugliest mother f***er, Gilbert Gottfried, is here tonight.  He looked like Benjamin Button when he was six.  Gilbert's kept a low profile since he was fired from Affleck just for writing an insensitive tweet.  Gilbert, if you want to tweet about a disaster tonight, tweet about Ellen Barkin's makeup. 
[01:26:00]  Too soon, too soon.  No, too good.  You do.  You look beautiful.  I've got to hand it to you.  You've been tortured and abused all night, and you're still hanging in there.  Roseanne, I'm not talking to you.  I'm talking to the chair you're sitting on. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, wait.  You know what?  Normally, when I roast a pig, it has an apple in its mouth.  After our last roast, I said, we need someone even bigger than Charlie Sheen, but this isn't what I meant.  Last year, we roasted Charlie.  This year, we're roasting the Chocolate Factory.  What's that joke?  You want me to explain the f***ing jokes to you? 
[01:27:00]  I'm sorry.  What was it?  It means you're fat.  Oh, okay.  I'm looking forward to your new show, Tons of Anarchy.  Instead of running for president, why don't you try walking on a treadmill?  I'd vote for you, but I'm against big government.  Roseanne joined the Green Party because she was kicked out of the Tea Party for eating all the crumpets. 
[01:27:30]  How many personalities do you have?  Eight, nine?  What is it?  What are the odds they'd all be c***s?  Comedy comes from pain, people.  And nobody knows that better than this woman, the legendary Roseanne Barr.  Who was molested as a child.  Oh, that poor molester. 
[01:28:00]  Roseanne never got over it.  She felt violated.  She had trust issues.  She never got the candy he promised her.  Roseanne, I've always loved you for saying whatever you want, for never holding back.  And in these alarming times when comedians are second-guessing their imaginations and sometimes even apologizing for jokes, 
[01:28:30]  I consider you a hero and a martyr and a friend.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  I love you.  The Opinion 3 Channel.  Oh, yeah.  On Sirius XM.  Now, the manager's corner with the thoughts and opinions of the American League's winningest manager, the Orioles' Earl Weaver.  Today's show is sponsored by Baltimore's six best, your area Oldsmobile dealers, Anderson Olds, Schaefer & Strominger Olds, Lee Oldsmobile, Metro Olds, City Olds, and Stuberger Olds. 
[01:29:00]  And now, to the manager's corner with Earl Weaver.  Well, Bill Whitehouse, Earl, that certainly is an answer.  From Frederick Merriman, wants to know why you and the Orioles don't go out and get some more team speed.  Team speed, for Christ's sake.  You get fucking goddamn little fleas on a fucking basis, getting picked off, trying to steal, getting thrown out, taking runs away from you.  You get them big cocksuckers that can hit the fucking ball out of the ballpark, and you can't make any goddamn mistakes. 
[01:29:30]  Well, certainly, this show is going to get out in history, Earl.  Terry Elliott of Washington, D.C., wants to know why you don't use Terry Crowley as a designated hitter all the time.  Well, Terry Crowley's lucky he's in fucking baseball, for Christ's sake.  He was released by the Cincinnati Reds.  He was released by the fucking goddamn Atlanta Braves.  We saw that Terry Crowley could sit on his fucking ass for eight innings and enjoy watching a baseball game, just like any other fan,  and has the ability to get up there and break one open in a fucking night. 
[01:30:00]  So if this cocksucker didn't mind his own business and let me manage the fucking team, we'd be a lot better off.  Well, certainly, you've made your opinions known on the fans' questions about baseball, Earl, but let's get to something else.  Alice Sweet from Norfolk wants to know the best time to put in a tomato plant.  Alice Sweet ought to be worried about where the fuck her next lady's coming from, rather than where her next goddamn tomato plant's coming from.  If she'd get her ass out to fucking bars at night and go hustling around the goddamn street, she might get a prick stuck in her once in a while. 
[01:30:30]  I don't understand where these questions are coming from, Tom.  That's about it from Manager's Corner.  Go fuck yourself and the fuck with your show coming up next on the Baltimore Oriole Baseball Fucking Network.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul, Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Uncle Paul, now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now, cause here comes Uncle Paul. 
[01:31:00]  Let me show you how to make a big boy love ya.  On today's episode, Uncle Paul reminisces about going to a baseball game.  We saw Joe DiMaggio pop into a double play in Ebbets Field.  Back when I was your age, we didn't have all these goddamn blacks in the game.  I would always go to the ball game there.  Have a hot dog, get to know somebody.  You go to the bathroom, nobody would say nothing if there was a couple of you in the stall.  We never went to the polo grounds.  I had a misunderstanding with a youngster. 
[01:31:30]  I thought that he was stealing one of the little baseball bats.  So I took him into the men's room.  Searched him.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul, Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Uncle Paul, now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now, cause here comes Uncle Paul.  Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show.

[01:39:00]  ice tea fucking uh he plays a cop you fuck but you assume when you see this stuff on on tv or in a  movie that they have security around so you can do your they had one cop thing they had one cop that  had a huge afro and mirror shades all right he's the most amazing cop i've ever seen so he's in the  show too no he's a real cop real cop but he was i thought he was an actor and when he showed up  that was our security duty and he had a friggin he's he's he's just this huge fro and mirror 
[01:39:30]  sunglasses nice it was amazing but you were onto something though if you're if your town looks like  it's still in the 70s you're in a bad neighborhood yeah it was oh yeah you know when there's school  graffiti and rust and yeah there's just every type of restaurant still boarding up windows yeah there's  like every restaurant in the world like from every other country on one strip yeah yeah one block  yeah it's just china it's just fucking everything is right you're like oh god the 70s yeah and 
[01:40:00]  there's just like people do their actual food shopping in a deli yeah yeah there's no supermarket  there's no fucking starbucks you go to the deli for coffee yeah they go they're coming out with  bags of groceries yeah and like spices and they're buying like oils oils yeah but uh we were walking by  but we were doing uh like the guy the guy would spit in front of instead of the cool walk we'd do  the cool walk and then the guy would step in like dog shit oh is that and then we did the cool walk 
[01:40:30]  and one of these the guy one of these spanish guys spit at us so we just started spitting at him  yeah yeah so it was it's a funny fucking show man it's really funny um like i hope it fucking gets  picked up i want to see it oh dude i fucking this is the dream i was literally sitting there like this  is the dream this is it i'm a cop i'm undercover i get to wear the badge with the chain that's pretty  cool i saw the pictures yeah they tried to put it on the the belt but oh jean he couldn't fucking  see it that's what the it was the later wasn't trying to be funny she goes i don't think we'll 
[01:41:00]  see it i'm like all right fuck off right but then uh and the fucking uh are you it's just funny  are you gonna and you have a main role right yeah i'm one of the leads wow i was gonna say  something but i'm the nicer we're being nice no trying well what were you gonna say we're not  gonna be successful but you got he says you got the main role and of course i was gonna mention  a role all right you know somewhere i wasn't i didn't i was just one of those things but i i laid 
[01:41:30]  off it all right but laid off it but then you just said it well you know what but i said it to explain  it right which you know takes the meanness out of it yeah the sting it's a whole new ball game here  i kind of like this or today that's just not hate on everything i like it i'm fucking liking it  give it a whirl hey that obi's face is literally going red i'm trying it's very difficult but it  it's time man it's nice to hate on things i'm gonna show a little emotion on this show 
[01:42:00]  not the same emotion of anger and hate hatred you know it's weird too that because you bring like  you but you're mean and angry about shit all the time this shit does stick with you and you  want to bring it to parties and places where it doesn't belong like you're at like somewhere  you're like ah this fucking idiot and people like what like why are they so amazed by that  i i get confused by that to this day you're right because most people don't just assume people are 
[01:42:30]  like how we talk but they just can't really do it no no that's why this show has been successful  no we say the things that people wish they could say well i guess then that means you're not saying  it at parties but these people are thinking it no there's actually people that don't think mean  shit like i really don't want to be mean to people yeah i've met people that aren't mean they're they're  all bottled up though that's so fake you think you think wait a minute you think that everybody  is fucking evil inside and some people bottle it up it's human nature oh absolutely the people that 
[01:43:00]  are nice are bottling up such hatred so what you're doing on this show is actually a service  well we're yeah we're an extreme version of it but i think i think it makes a good point i think  yeah a lot of this shit is getting away from the what we're trying to do here though this we're  discussing instead of saying that is true you're wrong you stupid fuck can't hate it whoa no i was  just giving the example how i used to would have done that's it i'm sorry that dude it's not that bad  is it bobby was hating on my swollen hand before it was pretty funny though he said that this hand 
[01:43:30]  is how both of my hands would look if i kept working i'd have like those fat old work guy  hands you gotta fucking get that check out how does it feel when you it's tight if you're listening  yesterday anthony punched a chair really hard while i was gambling oops gambling yeah oh you don't think  he was gambling oh i was gambling oh where are you and i was in chicago i was in a casino down there 
[01:44:00]  why would why why'd you get so mad how much money what how much does it make for you to snap and  punch a chair well the original marker was 10 grand wow original original marker jesus christ um  but i had built that up to sixty thousand dollars are you fucking me no no will you fuck me  oh okay whatever 60 g's oh wow then yes back down to just the ten thousand that the original marker 
[01:44:30]  was meaning you broke even which is breaking even but then when we me and keith went to go pay off my  marker for the ten grand keith went to take a piss i'm standing there at the counter she's like getting  all the papers ready and i'm looking at ten thousand dollars and thousand dollar chips in front of me and i  said hold on i grabbed it went to a table and i go deal oh my god and she dealt a hand for ten 
[01:45:00]  thousand dollars and i won but i i had punched the chair when i uh had to walk away from the table  because i was out because you were even in life yeah wow but i was so mad because i was thinking like  what part of the chair did you hit the back yeah there's a soft chair that's the back of the chair  the back of the back part had like you know metal or whatever or wood yeah and i fucking slammed it  that's about the logo of the casino wasn't in it oh man right walk around just gotta walk around  with that ghibli's casino but just a big g just a big bruised yeah yeah it looks fucked up though 
[01:45:30]  right yeah it's a little it looks better than it did yesterday yeah it looks fucked up it's a little  better but look you can move a big man hands anyways though those look at his fat sausage  fingers on the other hand he's got man hands like i have a little girl yeah me and you get the same  dude our hands are just terrible our hands are for raising babies like if we were in a tribe yeah me 
[01:46:00]  and you would stay home with the kids while they went out and hunted that's wonderful that's  wonderful but you're not wrong me and you would make the aqueduct system  you'd be gathering berries in a basket and eating them is that what you want to say no no no no just  i'm being nice that was a test it was a test i think i passed huh i uh i could never gamble like  that i don't know how you could actually be mad me and sam were gambling this kid's a lucky little  devil too i think keep him around he's a little horseshoe oh yeah he dude he fucking won every time

[01:47:00]  i'd be embarrassed here's what i would i would be embarrassed to tip the waitress that much  what 80 bucks what you like like in the course of the whole well theoretically we could have turned  10 000 into 80 000 yeah right if we turn 10 into 80 it'll take so long to put all those coins in  there's no more coins i get it i'm keep i'm kidding too  i love the slot machines why the wheel of fortune slot because you get to spin it goes and it goes 
[01:47:30]  wheel of fortune i've heard it  wheel of are you sitting there the same shit over and over again oh and it spins and everybody  kind of move the they moved some of the um machines away from the gaming tables a little  further than it used to be yeah in a lot of casinos because people playing cards it's

[01:50:00]  she really mentally off like a crazy person what's wrong with her because she did she would  just clam up and not talk and then just snap she wouldn't she'd be like crazy yeah she would they  would be like look you have to do this you have to do we have to do the speech you have to learn  this stuff and she wouldn't she would just not acknowledge these people she's a complete joke  it'll be i mean it's gonna take you know a few more years but she'll be known as a complete and  utter joke eventually but she was she was able to hang in there even after all that crazy shit 
[01:50:30]  yeah people still respected her for a while but now her own party's like no you're you're gonna  fucking sit we don't want you know you saying anything at this thing and then a few more years  people will be like oh god yeah she's a joke yeah yeah they don't want you know the the memory of  that horrible ticket uh up there in the convention they just don't want that well it's just dumb take  a hike i would love to know the guy who picked uh sarah palin who wasn't john mccain no he didn't  want her to get into us it was one of their fucking guys and what is that guy down uh doing 
[01:51:00]  nowadays probably has a show here he's probably fucking hey whoa whoa whoa whoa it'll be a good  thing for him and his family that's true fuck this place really yeah fuck this place why this place  has offered you a lot of opportunity has given you fans has helped a lot of people  that's terrific that's terrific that's terrific really giving you a place to go every day to be  creative oh really yeah giving you a nice paycheck really yeah yeah the millions of dollars that they 
[01:51:30]  paid you yeah thousands thousands hundreds hundreds of thousands hundreds of thousands really  possibly really jesus christ stupid and you're pushing that button yeah fuck the fuck really that's  so funny well you'll get there someday it's called a few money a few money oh what i love that do you  have a few money yeah oh god gotta have a few money years fucking years ago fucking playing a slot 
[01:52:00]  machine with this fucking gorgeous little boy girl yeah but even when i had no money i wasn't playing  the slot machines it's my point fuck you money would be great i remember the days ago in atlantic city  with like 200 it was you know and that's it that was it like 200 bucks and i would what'd you do  with 200 down there yeah five dollar table yeah you just sit there and i hope hope i hope you don't  go through all of it in one clip but you know yeah and that's the worst when you go through all your 
[01:52:30]  money like in that fucking 20 minutes and you're like i have four days left in my vacation yeah what the  it's like what because you know that bug is going to be there that's not going away that's what it is  and then you go to the atm you fucking start does does anyone know the percentage of people that walk  away from any given hotel in atlantic city as a winner it's not you could long weekend long weekend  you get there on let's say uh i don't know thursday you leave on a sunday how many of those people  are actually leaving a winner and then in the end you got you still got to pay for the hotel and 
[01:53:00]  everything else your parking your restaurants and yeah another one true there's some comps  happening but what is the percentage would you guess it's got it's way it's it's it's i would  say it's five percent tops yeah but it depends on what you consider winning you think it's more  than that might be yeah but you know what though old people consider winning if they get a couple  free dinners a bag a hat dude i mean they wake up at six to get that fucking that sun that beach 
[01:53:30]  bag if you walk away on beach bag if you walk away with ten dollars i call you a winner yeah so  so what percentage of people would you think some people think about look if i walk away even  and we had a great weekend yeah that's like winning that's how i am yeah i go down there to just you  know enjoy myself yeah knowing i'm gonna lose money you're not a gambler uh not like no i mean  regular i guess not many people anthony's a fuck we were in vegas i was like this motherfucker has 
[01:54:00]  you have to not give a fuck about thousands of dollars yeah like i get i start to shake  when i gamble and there's like more than 300 on the table i start to shake it's crazy i get nervous  like like uh and i get nervous about you assholes at blackjack because am i fucking you did i do the  right thing oh boy yeah you gotta be like oh no hit it what are you doing oh fuck did you find the  percentage they say about seven to nine percent i said five seventy nine percent oh he said seven 
[01:54:30]  seven to nine oh my mistake under ten percent yeah i've seen that seems a bit high though but if  that's what i would i would i would think but i think atlantic city is that just on atlantic city  right no it's just casinos in general in the states that's fucking nuts yeah what a fucking  just that's a robbery that's a great business racket what i mean that's a great business seven to  nine percent of you are going to walk away winners at any given moment so that's over 90 percent 
[01:55:00]  they're taken yeah they and they literally took that from the old west just a fucking couple cowboys  yeah in a shitty saloon and now it's this made it a giant fucking industry wow that is pretty  goddamn wild i hate that i hate that casinos are popping up all over the place i have to put one  in new york too right they're they're gonna be every fucking where yeah and then you you know you're  not gonna see any of that money they need to uh yeah get their tax money but yeah that's what it's 
[01:55:30]  all about i don't mind then it goes to these bullshit things i hate that they put  if they're gonna do a casino though i like when they do it right when they do these shit casinos  where they have it's not 21 but it's you know it's fucking indian 22 oh they're trying to get  around the fucking and it's like you know they did that at the fucking uh at the commerce casino in  la yeah when i played poker over there yeah uh i wanted to play like you know i got knocked out of 
[01:56:00]  the poker game and i want to play some blackjack yeah it was some kind of wacky fucking blackjack i  don't even know how it's played seriously but i'm like get the fuck out of here that's not blackjack  it's played on a twister board yeah i don't even know what the fuck it was just to get around the  law but it was it was stupid yeah what was it i'm trying to remember what it was vibe of real of the  actual game because they don't allow yeah like a certain type of gambling or gaming or whatever 
[01:56:30]  they wanted to call it so they had to do something where you weren't playing against the house for  something it was so bad hey you bet on the horses it's one of those carny games that you have to  shoot water in the hole the clown mouth yeah great they do that in new york though they got that uh  it's all fucking electronic games raceway and stuff so and they think it's like well we have blackjack  and craps and everything and roulette but it's uh on an electronic game it's like then why not just  have the real game i hate it i hate the new slot machines yeah i don't yeah i like there's something 
[01:57:00]  about a mechanical something that somebody built like an old watch yeah that has to on a you know  look on a certain number of things you're gonna win that's just the way this fucking steel machine  was made but something that look that is just computerized that's not real yeah i don't fucking  trust it i can make my iphone do whatever i want it to do never mind this stupid jailbreak in their  slot machines yeah great i don't fucking like it i just don't like it because to me with an old 
[01:57:30]  machine like that you can't be up in a room hitting a button to go all right let him win now i know that  doesn't happen but i think that sometimes when i'm on a slot machine they're like hey that's robert  kelly oh and a show big fan of the show let him win good give him a couple 80 dollars that's sam  robbins give him give him 120 on the wheel i think that you know i'm sorry ace some people just win 
[01:58:00]  that no no you never hit three jack putts were you talking about what's the matter with you were  you talking about perfect pair blackjack is that i don't know what it is this guy's saying that's  what you're talking about all right let's see what i need to know because you're yeah let's see what  it is uh greg in california greg hey how's it going i live about an hour away from commerce and  there once a week oh it's a perfect pair blackjack it's some like shitey form of blackjack but they  do have normal blackjack there but what they do now what's perfect pair blackjack it's like 
[01:58:30]  it you need to match it or beat it with somebody else at the table it's really really complicated  oh it's gotta be some kind of team effort what yeah yeah yeah yeah it's like you know what don't  have a casino you know what uh sam roberts has the rules right in front of him yeah thank you  perhaps he can convey it thank you great doesn't explain anything now perfect pairs blackjack uses  the same rules as vegas strip blackjack but with an extra feature a side bet the side bet is for 
[01:59:00]  perfect pairs by placing a bet in the perfect pairs spot on the blackjack table you are placing a side  bet that the first two cards dealt to your hand lost will be a pair oh i'll see that now that's  a side bet i'm out that's that's different than they might have changed it in california and allow  blackjack there now because this was a few years back but it wasn't blackjack it was some fucking  crazy ass like you said some crazy ass fucking engine blackjack yeah i don't like that i don't 
[01:59:30]  like all the other bullshit the uh you know the uh the fucking indian polka the spicy tequila polka  spanish 21 yeah spanish 21 i hear what people try to sell me on these games no you got to play  spanish 21 it's shut up what the fuck is it fucko l uo i'm playing regular 21 but it's fun it brings  you back it's fun it brings you back to a kid when you made up all your own make your own rules all  right twos and yeah really nines are now can i scream out that something's in the wood pile

[02:04:30]  fuck you have nothing to lose why would you even think that that's what where phobias come from it's  your fear of the actually falling off that your brain is like just fucking do it go just jump a lot  of the fear is that you don't trust yourself yeah you don't know i can't even think about it that's  crazy oh there's also the fear like oh fuck this plane's gonna crash or or i don't know the  building's gonna tip over yes but a lot of the fear you have control if you hurl yourself over  the railing a lot of the fear is that your trust in your own fucking being you're like holy fuck i 
[02:05:00]  don't trust myself enough to be on this ledge wow patrice used to have a great bit about that  intrusive thoughts he used to be like when you hold a baby because i don't hold babies because i get  those intrusive thoughts i'm just like fucking touchdown motherfucker right right right like you  know what i mean or like when you're driving and you just want to you know fuck i could just i've  had those yeah yeah that's what i i have them like when you're driving down the road you i could  just turn this and flip fucking flip this car free will huh yeah a little free will yeah it's creepy

[02:07:00]  head doesn't look there's no steel first of all this bugs me because there's no steel beams  involved no it's just glass it's like walking down the apple store stairs what those fuck  you can't even do that fuck that it's like you see it's the brackets are holding all the windows  in place the bracket is a fucking inch by an inch yeah but it's strong it's strong material fuck  that so you wouldn't bungee cord jump skydive uh no why would you jump the fuck out of a plane

[02:15:30]  know celebrate your fucking cock i was watching the uh commercial yesterday and like you know the  commercials are always the the they're in the kitchen or something and the woman looks over  and she goes like hmm and the guy's like oh and and and she's like smiling and and she looks  she gives him the up and down look and he like oh that's right not in his head because he took the 
[02:16:00]  pill and he could fuck her now and all i was thinking was like before he realized he's got  to take the pill he's got the erectile dysfunction you don't like not get a rod and then and then you  just you just the next day go and get a pill right i'm gathering you you'd hang out there and just  not have a rod for a while i'm like i'll give it a try honey like how long was she given the seductive  look in the in the kitchen like oh i see and then just ending with total disappointment waiting for  the pill to take hold not even before he even went to get a prescription is no pill no nothing 
[02:16:30]  you know he's like i don't know what happened i can't get no rod and no one talks about the  other side of it are the women insulted that you have to take a pill to get hard they should be  because i'll tell you one thing if you can't get a rod the first line of fucking defense should be  maybe you're not really turned on by the woman in here you know it's easy to say that but i think  eventually it's going to happen to all of us i'd like to know what the percentage is though  of men that have a legitimate a legitimate physical problem right or or even a mental 
[02:17:00]  problem or you're just sick of that body and face and if some other hot fucking girl came up to you  you'd be like bad attention you get desensitized to your fucking chick's body because you see her  naked all the time you're taking showers together you you know all that shit so right yeah once you  get desensitized to something it's like uh if you don't jerk off or watch porn for a while you get  you'll you'll want to fuck your chick you know you'll want to fuck your chick yeah i've done it i've

[02:25:30]  as she was talking to me she's uh 80 years old and i think she just wanted to tell someone that  she lived a life of course she did i she she was telling me that she needs three references to get a  cat can i ask a question and i know it's probably a dumb question um when you get when you have that  hole in your neck to breathe that's a different pipe than the food goes down correct i guess right  yeah yeah i guess when the food gets lodged it's it because it went down the other yeah there's one  one two you know how you say it went down the wrong pipe it splits and the epiglottis covers your 
[02:26:00]  windpipe and lets the food go down to yourself because you do it in steve dr steve voice  ah no no i don't do it jimmy does the fucking steve thing the best what happens is uh robert  but now where you're where you're uh uh uh yeah because you're pushing air through your vocal cords  so that's gotta be her but i think voice box i think the point is bobby said that bobby said this 
[02:26:30]  broad probably was somebody i bet she's she's everything we just talked about yeah but she must  have been a goer in her day she had a lot of confidence she said she she uh worked in  entertainment as a dancer and uh and she sang and uh yeah now she's talking to me on columbus avenue  because i think she wanted someone to know that she just lived she had a cart huh she have a cart  yeah like a shopping cart or a homeless no she had one of those fucking walkers where it becomes a seat 
[02:27:00]  oh with the seat because i'm like breaks on it because what happened was she walked by me she  goes is that food good i'm like yeah it's good i was i was eating a dumb chicken greek plate type  of thing and she goes uh uh i don't know if i could eat that i got diabetes i'm like you're a wreck  i'm like here pop this cherry tomato in your hole yeah i go no man it's rice disaster a little salad  a little chicken what's on the chicken i go some spices put the dressing in her throat and shake her  next next thing you know she have her spit it back out on you

[02:42:30]  does that happen well it's a fucking epidemic isn't it dogs that's it themselves forever before  humans got involved the dog's sodium intake is a bit much now we got to take his little doggy blood  pressure i got you on this i hate i look at i agree i hate all right good i don't put the coats on  you're not a fan of the dog boot i don't put and they're little balloons now like you put a balloon  it's like what do you mean balloons they're little balloons like instead of putting the booty on you  can they have these little balloons that you put on a dog on their feet and they don't come off 
[02:43:00]  because it's like inflated over their foot my dog and then my dog's gonna walk like a brand new deer  oh yeah they don't even know my dog looks like an asshole fucking fawn what what dude what happens  with the shit now are you a plastic bag over the hand guy so you get the nice warm feel of moist  shit through that thinnest layer of plastic or are you a newspaper guy or what i'm the fucking i need  silver or blue non-see-through fucking doggy bags one time but are you feeling it through i can't just 
[02:43:30]  my wife it bothers you to see it through a dude it bothers me to see it feel it i would i've never  picked up dog shit in a plastic bag in my life it's the worst because i'm not gonna fucking do that  that's the beauty of having one of these yippy dogs though because their shit is a lot tinier  fucking yippy but their shit is tiny but it's the same thing yappers you're still picking up shit  like an animal we have to take a break what just because dl is here it's a timing thing i don't know  how much time he's got with the program and he's got a new book out called i want you to shut the fuck

[02:45:00]  jay says a real man uh-huh gets a shepherd a pit bull or a wolf he's got yip-yap dogs  yeah a real man a real man in 1978 exactly what is it in german he lets it he lets it out of his 40  conoline van with a molly hatchet mural on the side shut up yeah that's what happened to wolf in your  little new york city hall that'd be great yeah i'm gonna pick up a big hot wet dick on the sidewalk  three times a day go fuck yourself that's what you need i pick up a little pencil shit i'm happy with 
[02:45:30]  yeah look who's uh here with us dl googling man always a pleasure dl obviously you got a book we'll  talk about that but do you have a dog or anything akita you have an akita but in california so all right  in california that's a man's dog now that's a man do you walk your own dog i do not black dogs never  walk they just stay in the yard stay in the yard what am i a house arrest 
[02:46:00]  he's got a little ankle but most people don't walk dogs if they're out of the big cities  you forget because you see it all the time in new york but i see a lot of people walking they live in  such small apartments right exactly you can't let your dog shit all over your one right right there's  not a good because i was talking about how i've see i see people have to walk their dogs in the in  the dead of winter and it's just brutal 10 o'clock at night 11 o'clock at night you're you're lounging  around having a good time last thing you want to do is go out and i don't see the trade-off as being 
[02:46:30]  this great thing with a dog that i want to be doing that you know you don't have a dog no not a doggy  guy what's the one what's the one dog everyone hates i got the answer because like i don't i'm not a  big fan of the yippy dogs i don't like zihuahuas that are my wife zihuahuas yeah that's the tiny  dog i would think like a poodle looks like shit poodle just looks like an old white lady i don't  like it high maintenance yeah that fucking poodle suck kind of shave like wacky shapes like a hedge  yeah that perm that they always yeah i fucking hate that perm i think there's one dog most people 
[02:47:00]  hate and it just makes people uncomfortable when they see him and that would be the greyhound  oh i don't know people those are regal those are some regal ass you like when you see a greyhound  yeah they're kind of cool i get scared when i see his dog your dog your dog's like a little lion  akitas are kind of they could be they could be crazy i had a therapist who had two akitas and he'd  have them in session and one would just go and he'd be like it's okay bobby they weren't there i was  what akitas don't fuck around there's no therapist there either yeah yeah you have to be the alpha 
[02:47:30]  male right when you own a fucking akita you do yeah yeah right there's no fucking around with an  akita like i don't want to have to live with something that i gotta show who's the boss all  the time you don't want to be live with a black woman again let me tell you  you think you think akita is rough okay it's the perfect analogy because every you know every  time when you you live with a with a with a descendant of a wolf you you every every moment 
[02:48:00]  of your existence with that with that animal is trying to you have to establish down yeah like  if you don't like he has to he has to do what i say immediately yeah i have a shih tzu that doesn't  happen oh boy i go like this diva she rolls on her belly and shows me her pussy which i wish my  wife would do no every minute it's like is this back if it's a if it's a power vacuum yeah yeah it's 
[02:48:30]  like a struggle every day who's gonna be but your dog will never get it because it'll always try to  be always and and and my wife will never get it i'm telling you i'm like like i have like it's the  i'm like you just we're 28 years in stop don't we understand each other enough  you see what chad did you understand see how this can happen oh my god why why i i got nothing on  the greyhound you don't mind greyhounds i love why wouldn't you like them beautiful they just 
[02:49:00]  they are they look like they just belong on a track and that's it a track oh boy there's some  animal rights people i'm being honest though i love i see them and they don't they look so  uncomfortable they're kind of skittish looking and they don't bark their bodies are weird you  kind of look like heroin addicts yeah like methadone yeah they're they're actually alternative comic  looking alternative comics of dogs  yeah they wear like cookie hats grow mustaches 
[02:49:30]  deal has a book out yeah that's and you went with a nice cover it just feels good this is like  some feel the paper bob yeah yeah on the cover i know that is like a that's a book jimmy smells  the books and that every time he opens it up and yeah he loves i've never actually read a book but uh  yeah but you know write one piece of cake right that's a different it says uh d.l hugley i want you  to shut the fuck up how the audacity of dopes is ruining america bravo for you yeah i didn't think 
[02:50:00]  they would let us do that title really no i didn't of course not i didn't think it was crime books and  not like i self-publish that's true put it on the internet you're not a self-publisher i hear that  self-publishing does well for some people right but when i said that that was the title like what  really yeah okay so besides just the words what do you got in there what's uh well it's just kind  of my look on how uh we we like everybody like even when i watch like i watch you on fox news and 
[02:50:30]  i watch that network it's like wearing a tight shoe so you feel good when you take them off  but everybody's always so certain they have the answers to what what else everybody they speak  with such certainty like if you do what i say then everything will be a lot better and and and  every time we do what they say it gets more and more fucked up yeah i don't care if it's voting for  this guy or cutting taxes here going to war here and it's it just became this thing and it's i look  at communities relationships so it's uh it was a lot of fun i i i gotta agree with you we were talking 
[02:51:00]  about that earlier it's ridiculous the fact that both sides this has got to be one of the filthiest  campaigns i've seen and it's still you know early on relatively speaking and uh but it's just bashing  back and forth and then the blatant lying by both sides yes that they're not bashing and they're  taking the high road and the other guy is is taking the low road when they're both just being despicable  right this time out no one wants to talk about any issues and then when one person does mention an 
[02:51:30]  issue they want to talk about why would you bother because the other side is just going to pound on what  you said right pick it apart take it completely out of context right so the uh there's really no  working together anymore but but but that that's the stated mission when people go but you can't  really blame politicians because the american people sent this congress to stop this man and  they didn't want him to be able to accomplish accomplish anything now that nothing's being done 
[02:52:00]  they're mad that nothing's being done they voted in a man who said he was going to give him health  care he gave him health care they got pissed off that he did what he says but didn't he have a  majority for two years yeah he did yeah he had a majority for two years but even even the democrats  were kind of going ah yeah yeah but ultimately we you get what you pay for and i think that  we we we vote in sniveling cowards who only care about keeping a gig yeah right and they don't do  anything to make anything any better like i i watched the congressman say uh he was running i think 
[02:52:30]  was in uh india indiana and he was saying i don't i don't want to put it on him but he was saying  basically uh that they were making an analogy between the teams you know uh offense and defense  he said we want them to lose he basically was saying they don't play it's like the giants  hoping that the that their office does shitty right right yeah yeah yeah it's like it's like stalkers  like if you break up with a woman and you want that woman to do so fucking bad that she comes  back to you that's not patriotism that's fucking stalking that's really like please bitch have 
[02:53:00]  such a hard life did you decide i'm not a badass that's how that's what it is not cut the coming  back part but i have wanted them to suffer horribly but yeah yeah i i i see what you mean there um  but i i also you kind of see that both ways also you know i mean uh you you can hardly say that the  democrats were supporting bush no especially but there wasn't this nobody called him a liar or a 
[02:53:30]  terrorist hitler terrorist no no some of the some of the uh the protest signs that were drew monkeys  with his family nobody there clearly is there's a natural ideological kind of uh well i think but  here's what i think antagonism both sides has but right but i think if you want to hit somebody below  the belt obviously the racial angle the racist angle is going to come out when you want to hit  obama and his administration below the belt because you want to you want to hurt as much as you can right 
[02:54:00]  like with bush they they pounded him uh uh and and there were legitimately posters of him looking like  hitler um and these were are not at these crazy fanatical protests these were at you know you basic  uh democrats are gathering somewhere and you know i i but i i blaming both sides it's the extremists  have really become almost the norm on both sides it's the it's us the people this is not they didn't 
[02:54:30]  take over some hunter this we we went to the ballot box and said i want this guy who espouse nothing but  rhetoric and bullshit that you can't prove and i want him in office and and both sides do that right  they vote for these vacant like clearly we're like children who blame our parents for us being  you did it yeah you did you voted for this dickhead who can't do anything and then you're wondering why  these guys wouldn't even be smart enough to be at junior college professors and they're running the 
[02:55:00]  country like yeah yeah when the economic the downturn happened nobody knew anything about the economy  no no one knew how to even start approaching like to speak about it right no one could speak they  they constantly were saying well i have to read this and by that they mean interns will read it  right and give them sort of a a truncated version of cliff notes the cliff notes how amazing is that  the sound bites so they could get on the news and almost sound like they might know what they're  talking about uh again just to keep their own gigs but look at what they vote they vote for them 
[02:55:30]  because oh i liked his father name recognition or they vote for them because of their stance on a  particular issue like uh whether he likes men to get married to men or whether he is for a woman  being mostly issues they have no say in anyway as you know they don't they don't ever go we might  get into this economic crisis you might want to know something about what the world yeah no shit yeah  you might want to hey did anybody take that little college course and right economics anybody take  anything can you balance a checkbook at home right something were you an obama guy deal 
[02:56:00]  i'm still an obama you still are oh yeah but do you feel like nothing's getting done here's the  thing i do feel like nothing's getting done but i also feel like i've never seen a group of people  that before you step in office go i want you to fail right like just like i'm going to work as hard  as i can to make sure that you fucking fail i've never seen that before and i think obviously some  things are his doing but there is a there is and no one i think we can't be reasonable and deny the  fact that people were they set their feet in stone and say i'm not doing shit for this guy i don't care 
[02:56:30]  what it is even even when he does stuff that they want him to do let me think that's based on him  being black i i think part of it i think it's undeniable that there is a racial element in it  it's undeniable like you've never seen somebody get called a liar on the president of the united  you never saw a supreme court justice go that he basically called him a liar too  when 80 percent of black people voted for obama you don't see that as being a racial thing where they  only voted for him because he's black but i would say that uh uh 95 percent of white people 
[02:57:00]  voted for white people you never had a choice as to who you'd vote for the republican party the  makeup of the republican party is just as white as the as as the percentages of black people that  vote but obama wouldn't have gotten in without a huge white vote right yeah yeah yeah absolutely  but look at but look at what here's the thing if the republicans believe they had uh agenda that  was inclusive they wouldn't be trying to stop people from voting in 26 27 states i don't think  uh see i don't agree with what uh the democrats are saying about that uh i think having id to go 
[02:57:30]  into vote is not a problem you're absolutely right and i agree with you yeah but changing the rules so  people have to vote or denying people the right to vote early closing polls early uh uh uh those things  when they when they cut off early voting which they know black and older people do they do stuff like  that then that's a problem i don't care that you should have right right okay you should have to  have id i agree with you just like you should have to have more than one fucking tax form  to i have to listen whatever i got to do to lease a car the president got to do that 
[02:58:00]  to fucking be president all right i can't lease an apartment in new york exactly  unless i show three years worth of tax that's that's right true in Manhattan i can't lease a  apartment but you can be president without showing that shit i can't get a membership to  fucking price club but you can you can't this is i'm not gonna show you my taxes because there  might be something in there yes motherfucker that's why we want to see it you think he's 
[02:58:30]  gonna show eventually uh probably not when the option you don't think he is huh no i'm probably  not when the option is what you thought i did is probably worse better than what i actually  right that's that's why he's holding out yeah when you it's gotta be bad idea of what i did is  is not even as shitty as what i really did fuck it i'll take my i just assume it's really bad here's  the deal though yeah i don't think either uh side the republicans or democrats with this election  uh are going to change anyone's mind based on what they say do release don't release right now 
[02:59:00]  i think the the the real trick now is just getting the people out to vote that already  would vote either way right we're not changing anyone's mind based on what we're seeing there's  not a a an obama voter that's going to vote for romney and vice versa based on but but issues  at this point let me just say this i'm a i'm a fairly open-minded guy like i could have listened to  tim palentine i could have listened to him i could have listened to the the uh the cat from utah i 
[02:59:30]  could have listened to him i could have listened to ron paul but but when you go through that primary  that they had to go through dude when herman kane is actually a fucking serious camera yeah yeah  that was silly the 10th dude who when you when when when pizza hut is an aspirational yeah you  ain't fucking you ain't president and i actually hope that they like uh made him their candidate  because it would have been funny to watch him support a black candidate and still try to suppress the  black and it was that he really that that that that bachman that sent home that these people that 
[03:00:00]  they were our top choices yes that's that's the best we have to offer it amazes it and then so how  is that possible how could i even hope to when you give me a sarah palin and what option have i had  i think we kind of forget though that every four years there is a cavalcade of clowns at the  beginning of of these uh that this wasn't the beginning oh no i know i know but that's just it 
[03:00:30]  i think we're i think we're also seeing something especially with uh social media and and 24 hour  news which has been around for a while but uh i think we're seeing uh it's a perpetuation of  the story if they have this weird character or somebody that upsets people they want to keep that  person in the news and in the forefront as long as they can meanwhile they should have dropped out  the the uh the party should have told them to get lost uh but the party's afraid i know yeah and the 
[03:01:00]  news just keeps it going and and people now with uh the ability to uh speak to so many other people  but i think they keep that going anything else there are people who who buy into these people  that we really are yeah yeah yeah we are a nation full of people that that like we were a great  nation led the one wars led the world to manufacture put a man on the moon now we're like we're like  people who got trust my babies who now fuck up daddy's hair like like we we can't do any of this 
[03:01:30]  shit we can on facebook we can like it that's pretty much yeah yeah and and and look at like no when  you go to a doctor when's the last time you went to a white doctor or uh or american yeah yeah it's  usually uh india the guy from india or a russian russian blonde is that your last name or the  shit i got like is that what are you but we don't even anything you need education for we don't  fucking do yeah yeah and proud and proud to not do it it is discouraging uh you know it it was kind 
[03:02:00]  of uh it was almost nostalgic to watch everybody celebrating um uh curiosity land on mars because it  was it was this thing like oh remember when we used to do this all the fucking time yeah and it  was just rooms full of these really smart and uh people that were well educated and just knew how  to wing things sometimes and now it's just but people hate smart people if you're smart people hate  you like the the fact that you we would turn our government over to guys that we want to have beers 
[03:02:30]  with or that you go to the fucking hot dog shows with or chili cook-offs you know that nobody does  anymore oh he's bold with me so i'm gonna vote for this fucking dickhead and when the world crumbles  he'll give us his recipe for his mother's chili like it's just like man what you get it's that  shit is cool to do when you got when everything's going good you don't care who's in charge when  everything's going good when shit gets bad you want people that know what the fuck they're doing and we  don't have that do you have any ideas of because i'm asked a lot uh solutions solution people like 
[03:03:00]  hey what you know so what's your idea on this and i'm really kind of boggled um about it do you have  any ideas of what i think that we need to hold just much like your children much like your your in  your relationship you need to hold the same with me all right wow i had to i think either you it's just  just like a team if if if the defense plays good and the office plays bad and that team loses 
[03:03:30]  everybody on that team is subject to be traded or cut and i think that that that uh government  should be just like that if you did well and the agenda moves forward okay you guys all you get  you get another two-year contract if not everybody's fucking fire yeah i kind of like that you mean like  a regular job there's like a regular when you don't perform well job right when it doesn't matter  what you do are not happy with you right you don't have your job anymore and that should be the way  the government works the balls as a as a we're fucking juveniles and we let people oh look at me and 
[03:04:00]  look at what he did if it didn't work everybody gets fired yeah that's what everybody has it ever  worked ever uh it's gotten worse when did it work it's worked better when did it work uh it was the  last time it worked uh we still have industry here i mean we don't really have technology i mean that's  in china apple we apple things okay concedes everything and makes it we exactly i understand  that but we have we are uh the forefront of that i mean we're the ones pushing the internet and all 
[03:04:30]  this stuff and facebook and all the social media we changed how people are elected we changed how the  world works how people communicate and i mean just walking around i mean you have a fucking uh a  device in your hand yeah it's it's crazy and what we're we're the ones pushing that it's not you know  other countries i mean no we did like we we're gonna make that shit in america and then they did make  it better yeah yeah yeah we do tv there's no fucking red hot eye beams flying out of fucking factories 
[03:05:00]  anymore with the whistle going right you know and a bunch of men with lunch boxes going to their cars  uh it's just that shit's gone well but it's gone and look at we didn't make that literally we  didn't make the educational changes you needed to make up until like i'd say this late 60s early 70s  we prided ourselves on being a nation of you know of being educated people right now we pride  ourselves on being a mighty nation like we we're like a drunk at a bar we'd rather kick like literally 
[03:05:30]  i bet i can kick your ass like we we're not we we the things that we're proud about are our ability  our money is where our mouth is and we really literally put our money in being able to whip  it china loans us the money so that we can be the baddest motherfuckers on earth but they out read us  they out learn us they're gonna out i mean we're out we're we're the things that we think are  important are are basically out of out of obsolete in in kind of a global so how do you get the money  that it takes because it's it's the money that it takes to educate people when we don't have that 
[03:06:00]  industry in this country anymore that we really need it's kind of a catch-22 you know you mean  we don't have how do how do we get uh the people educated so we can bring back uh the greatness when  it's not just having a great military and being mighty and kicking ass well i think we were always  kind of forward thinking we were always we didn't educate uh this this is really kind of weird but we  didn't educate people for the jobs that were here we we educated them for the jobs of the future and 
[03:06:30]  now we never kind of look forward like like look at all the things that we we learned about like  why the fuck am i learning this it's not even real yeah and then all of a sudden it's relevant and all  of a sudden it's relevant but we we kind of uh so reactive now and we're active we're reactive  because the small fights that we have about all these things whether you a woman can do this or  have rights for this or what we fixate on as opposed to the overall if we care about america we really  care about america and if i hear one more real american but it's unreal american all that kind 
[03:07:00]  of shit if you care about america you want it to do well and you want it to do well regardless of  who's in charge yeah absolutely and i think there are people who don't like that and i think that's  both sides there are people who want uh you know this war to be lost so somebody looks bad or wants  this to be able to die so somebody looks bad and then i think people don't have the best interest  with this country at heart yeah because it makes them look bad if they go against their party and  again either side um yeah i i agree with you it's it's very hard but but look at the supreme like the 
[03:07:30]  republicans were mad at the supreme court um but basically every decision that that the republicans  conservatives hate was presided over by uh a guy who was appointed by republic and i think there's  something about giving a guy a lifetime job where he goes i don't have to listen to these crazy  he starts telling the truth you never see a liberal judge go conservative you see conservatives  go very liberal but that could be that could also be interpreted as liberals don't have the ability 
[03:08:00]  to compromise or no they're stuck in one mindset this is true but look at the decisions people have  made where they just went like brown versus water education come on there was that was a  an incredibly brave thing to do yeah and a guy who went these motherfuckers are crazy and i'm gonna do  the right i wouldn't uh i wouldn't want the supreme court voting on any voting for any hard right  issue they're they're all fucking like they're crazy they're crazy issues right i agree oh it's 
[03:08:30]  fucking it's it's lunacy but i also don't like a lot of the hard left issues either that gets a little  like like like what uh uh uh uh well you know me of course i'm a huge second amendment guy  but um uh i i but i but i but i also i am too though oh see that's very good i am too  okay yeah i get it right away i'll probably get it more than you i was just that was just the first 
[03:09:00]  one that popped in my head it's also kind of hard to um i i'd like to know where the money for  education will come from to pay for we never ask that about war we never go where we're going to  get money to blow up this fucking brown country we never ask we'll borrow money to kick somebody's  ass all right we never go we don't have the money for that but doesn't that seem a little more  pressing sometimes no it's not all the time sometimes i'd say since the 60s we we we there's 
[03:09:30]  probably maybe maybe desert storm maybe but since that shit we there's there's been no reason to  have somebody who won none in 10 years we're in afghanistan well we don't even know what the  fuck we're doing there now we just nobody wants to go let's come home we lost or it's over like so  we're in it's it's we're fucking in neutral ground where people are losing life it's like a video  game but except people are really actually dying and we're and we're hemorrhaging money  mm-hmm so so it would be better to kind of cut back on defense spending and funnel some 
[03:10:00]  education cut back on defense defense what kind of country do we want do we want to be the brochure  brochure of the country or we actually want to be the country that they brochure like when you read  the the tenants of this country yeah do you ever go on price line and go man that's a great  whole thing you get there what the fuck is this that's kind of like american now like people are  like when you look at the brochure that's good our our our our immigration policy  looks so big on the bro uh in the brochure what the fuck oh and the snack bar was great 
[03:10:30]  what kind of lens did they use to shoot this tiny pool continental breakfast  you said room service like look at look at that's a great point there are as many mexicans coming as  leaving and our on our like the immigration was net zero like many motherfuckers was coming and  leave when you can't get mexicans you're not that attractive when you can't get mexicans to sneak  over the fence to be here you're like oh i'll stay here you know there's a problem is this all in 
[03:11:00]  the book by the way so i don't have to read this anymore right there you go awesome so i don't have  to read you were supposed to sell books today now i feel like i don't have to this book deals with a  lot of uh political issues but the most thing the the most important thing in this book is  yeah uh why how hard it is to be married to a black woman it's like politic politic  pumpkin this is the last one let me tell you something i'm doing my wife and i've and i've  said this before i've never been with a white woman never never ever ever why you didn't have a desire  you didn't have a desire i mean because i'm sure they were going for you never but it always felt 
[03:11:30]  like that it always felt like it's not natural not naturally organic things people just go  through i'd like to fuck a black guy and you're the one up on and i i never i did it always felt  not to say that didn't happen like you're a you're a checklist i'm on the bucket list  why are you going through my hair products i just wanted to see what this was but that's not the  worst thing in the world no but it just never part of someone's bucket list fuck it right 
[03:12:00]  but i i you know i just have black women just do it for me they just do not for me like they do it but  um did you go hispanic at least uh yeah like if if my wife ever was hit by a train i think i'm  going what about asian yeah not asian no no i don't i don't think i'm just trying to see how  racist he is how racist he is i think it's a racist thing they don't like white girls and  asian girls is like really no yeah they really are like you know yeah  we're trying to make a bunch of tiger woods i talked to you do realize there's a lot of really  hot white girls out there there are okay all right no really i get it and i'm not look 
[03:12:30]  a guy look see i wanted to go black and just never uh went black see how come nobody says  how come he didn't go with a black guy i was scared oh yeah we asked all the time  what did you say with a black guy they're intimidated  the black guy right that could be a different yeah we've asked but he said he's got no game  me he's got no game to get a fucking no i used to uh i tell the story when i lived in buffalo i would  go to some of these black clubs i was looking for and i was just intimidated by what i've seen 
[03:13:00]  really yeah i grew up pretty nerdy though deal it's like uh you know you like spicy food but  it hurts your stomach that's how it is with love i love you but i know i'm gonna pay after i'm with  you like i know it's gonna be bad like what yeah i i but i think that that's part of uh it's like  never being able to kind of rope the wind it feels like to me like my wife is always like after all this  time we still have the arguments of a teen of teenage couple oh really yeah like like she got 
[03:13:30]  mad at me because i told that very joke where i said well if my wife get hit by a train maybe i'll  you know and she went what if people think you get that that's such a fucking unrealistic  yeah who gets hit by a train anymore anymore we live in calabasas california what trains are  coming through why were you walking in front of a train they don't just come out of nowhere  either right you know what their tracks yeah yeah there's bells and stuff right you've been on a  train it's not like a car that all of a sudden jumps the sidewalk and she really got mad and she 
[03:14:00]  gets mad about shit like like like my wife is is like well maybe we should have some more kids  i'm done with that yeah how many you got again deal three three i don't want and they're older  right they're all there and i'm happy and i'm cool and just i think that something happens to women  like you were talking about that when a woman gets older they go insane wondering what you're 
[03:14:30]  doing like i'm like young ass and i but i'm coming home right right yeah i get it  i don't want to be with it if i wanted to be somewhere else i'd be somewhere else right  literally my kids are grown got a couple houses there's no reason there's no if i didn't want to  be here right i wouldn't be so you shouldn't catch any shit for coming home right but you know but  that what are you thinking that ain't how it goes matter ever goes right yeah it is right are you in  hell deal no i just i just some of the arguments i have with her uh are arguments that that there's 
[03:15:00]  a certain unreasonableness that a woman just is built in with it like i'm like are you retarded you  are you're slow yeah like it's almost like you don't get yeah but you gotta stand though if she's home  right you're out on the road you're doing comedy you're a good-looking dude right uh you know you're  funny you're on you know shows you have books coming out you get you know dude we're on the 
[03:15:30]  road a lot you know the stuff that's coming up to us she's home just home well become a comic  wait a minute wait a minute make a afghan i don't give a fuck what you do just do something  i want to come on the road with you i go on the road to get away from you guys  i know i know this is not the caravan of love to work so when you go on the road you don't take  your chick with you no right right my side chick yeah but you ain't crazy no i don't take her either 
[03:16:00]  listen i i don't i i think monogamy is a fairly uh you only give monogamy to a woman so she leaves  you that's not a natural thing you know right it's a gift it's a decision it's a decision from a man  yeah you decide to give her what she needs so she'll to not kill herself yeah yeah yeah so it's  not it's not like natural like if they had shots for shit that you could get rid of in 24 hours i'd be  are you crazy i'd be on an ivy antibiotic drip is that crystal geyser in a way 
[03:16:30]  but that's the thing and i think now is is that is that it really you can tell that her my kids are  grown and her she's wondering what she she's gonna be and so it that's a tough like you go  through these transitions like right right and so this is a it's just on the mom thing a black girl  though it will put up a a bigger fight about everything but then and then a white girl you 
[03:17:00]  can kind of yell at and make her cry yes you know what i mean you know i you should thank me for  fucking them because that's what brought me to you some tells me bobby's used that before yeah  no kidding bobby's used that one that wasn't improv people in the repertoire you should call that  whore up thank her for eating my ass because that made me realize i didn't want that and now i'm with 
[03:17:30]  you right how would i know i want a regular right best i wish i could say like that oh my god your  wife would my wife this is the thing i've actually made my wife so mad recently i thought she's gonna  kill me i was like i i was scared to go to sleep literally and even if she like say she cut my  throat and i live yeah i would have to go testify so she wouldn't go to jail like i've been there  no your honest he's a good woman please passive aggressive black women though like i don't live 
[03:18:00]  with them i don't know what they are i've heard of them right my wife is passive aggressive yeah  like she'll do the old silent scorn oh boy the thumping of the feet upstairs you know because i  know she's just to let me know she's pissed about something oh god i hate that i hate silence  scorn yeah she does that loud walking no one likes it but some people could deal with it better you  think oh god i don't know if anyone deals with that yeah just a certain amount of things you gotta  you gotta you gotta do it's like uh and my wife can be passive aggressive but my wife like she goes to 
[03:18:30]  church i won't go um she is very uh outgoing she likes a lot of community and family and she likes all  that and i have to i have to do it because if i'm when i'm home i have to i have to do it but i think  she just likes she she she wants me to she now it's this thing where she wants me to she's trying  to mold me into being this guy i'm not like don't tell jokes like that i'm not this is who i am yeah

[03:31:00]  wife i do not there's a certain amount of annoying that all women have okay how great they are yeah i  wonder i i mean it's people in the bible ain't as good as my wife but she is a woman and women at a  certain point are fucking unreasonable and annoying like that's fair yeah like no matter i don't give a  what package they come in they are unreasonable and annoying and it's it's like you you you my  wife we were shooting i i did a documentary it comes out october 27th where i'm trying to get  the black man put on the endangered species list right it's hilarious my wife comes while i'm shooting 
[03:31:30]  the thing and i'm you know you know how it is to shoot all day and she's like i came to new york  because the last week i did that's over i came to new york to be with you and you haven't  spent any time with me because oh man i'm shooting fucking 15 hours working and you are are you  serious you are you this is like a real argument like yeah yeah i i was you're with me while i fall  asleep because i've been working 18 hours that's what the fuck this is yeah so it's it's like that 
[03:32:00]  and it's it's almost like uh my wife came to the set last week and i i was really expecting her  this is it's when you have expectations of your chick is usually when they fucking just drop the  ball because i was expecting her to be like this is amazing like you know this is wow and she was  walking around like i do this every week i'm a lead in a pilot this is a fucking moment in my i'm a 
[03:32:30]  lead in a pilot this is a career highlight i'm like oh my god this main in this business may never  happen again right and she walked in like this bitch has been on set like she has a chair with a  name on it but you know what some women are they're acting like this is not new because they're expecting  you to do it again right like really they don't like one time i remember i'll never forget this one  time i was innocent we i was somewhere and and i was really intimidated socially intimidated 
[03:33:00]  my wife pulled me over she said don't you ever act like you don't belong here never act like that  never my wife i have the best like i got a chick uh i knocked the chick up we were married right right  and um so my it fucked me up so the baby you know it was a horrible story so i finally was so overcome  with guilt that i told my wife i said i had a baby and it's crazy and and and the chick is trying to  blackmail me and i feel so you know my wife said to me i wish you had told me we could have went 
[03:33:30]  through that together she said that to me so i'm coming off the plane and the broad that i had the  baby by is at the airport and she sees me and my wife coming out the plane and she you can see that  glint in her eye like i can get this motherfucker i can do i can finally out this dude and i go and i  walk up to my wife and i say uh this is the girl i had the baby by jesus this is my wife my wife goes i'm  so sorry for your loss wins out of her sales though right and i and i went i'll i'll never 
[03:34:00]  i'll never not love this woman my wife i mean that was is that a difference between a black girl  and a white girl because i i've you imagine going home and telling your wife that you had to make me  bobby if i told my wife i think it's two different people too because you you you say  shit in a smoother way like i would go home nervous and be like listen i 
[03:34:30]  there's this fucking redhead in fucking cleveland she sat on my dick i'd lie and tell the truth  halfway through and yeah like i she fell on my dick i came because i i wasn't jerking off because i wanted  to have a baby with you that's why i came too quick i don't know dude i'm there's no way good for  d.l but that's uh that's some fucking that's one in a million yeah that story makes me nervous  that's a one in a million and so now when she acts when she acts like that i remember 
[03:35:00]  yeah and and like the girl don't think i'm not going to use that  if i ever get a girlfriend d.l's wife yeah yeah she understood she got it and my wife the girl  you know confidence bitch yeah she's in our relationship what what she's  up but mostly the girl is and obviously she's up and my wife uh about two or three years ago she  calls and she's on hard time my wife was sending her money jesus christ to me she was sending her  money and i could not i was like and i couldn't argue with her about i did she have the kid she had 
[03:35:30]  the kid so that that kid's out there somewhere no the kid's gone it was just a tragic it was horrible but  okay you're not getting into it yeah yeah so but but but she but she and i didn't have to tell  because it didn't do right yeah yeah but it just and i never feel bad about shit that i do like i  never did but that always bothered me and i was just always i was like i would hate for somebody to  walk up to her and tell us and stuff like that yeah horrible well that well that's a good thing also 
[03:36:00]  that because that's that was probably a lot of stress on you oh man just always waiting for someone to  pop out of the fucking woodwork and then i was like blow it up i was like i'm gonna tell her  she's gonna leave and i'll never and then i told her she went i wish you told me we could have went  to that together that's like some old back in the day when cowboys used to go i've i  fucking fucked up i had a baby with her like lonesome dove shit you know it's a long mire yes 
[03:36:30]  that's that's that's the way men used to be yeah yeah i had a baby with that woman i was on the road  for six months trying to get you some hay right yeah dude that's that like yeah i think we don't do  that we don't do that anymore because we don't want to deal with that like the the  fucking the thought of dealing with that would make me not come in the chick like that's why you  don't do it because yeah it's like like fuck that i just don't want to even oh my god i i even 
[03:37:00]  thinking of that is fucking petrifying yeah so it's like fuck it i just won't fuck you now you know  when i hear myself i go wow that's probably why she's like she's been through so much  bullshit with me that she's a soldier yeah she's but i but i i think i remember when i was a  uh i was a kid and we were dating and we were at redondo beach and and um you know what simoans  are the dinosaur didn't die he became a simoan the biggest people on the yeah they're flatbacks  yeah they are a fucking whore so we're walking by and one of those she falls into me and i go what

[03:52:30]  your appearances i hope it's good news are you on the air yeah no no problem all right what's she  gonna do maybe she just wants to tell you she was listening and she thought you did really well today  that doesn't happen no she doesn't listen to the show no neither does jess  your girl doesn't listen she doesn't like it is it you have to be  we listen to it on the road yeah times yeah and she'll i mean she's laughed out loud 
[03:53:00]  i remember she laughed remember steve from yellowstone of course we both fucking died yeah  at that one time i mean norton makes it she loves chip  we'll listen to it on the road but she won't ever listen to the show yeah she doesn't  just doesn't listen to the show it's weird too that the people that show up at my the ona fans  that like me and come to my shows yeah are usually couples like a dude and his chick all the time  in chicago the weirdest thing was some chick who was like hot said that she was there without her 
[03:53:30]  boyfriend because her boyfriend doesn't like the show but she does that's weird but i can understand  that because maybe you know for a girl if your girl likes this show and you kind of don't you're like  you fucking piece of shit yeah why do you why would you like this this is where you this is  entertainment for you really it's mean yeah it's nasty and by the way opie's whole  bullshit of no we're gonna try to be nice now it's bullshit so what you're saying is that that's 
[03:54:00]  bullshit horse shit yeah no shit shit because he first of all before you got here he's 45 minutes  of calling me a pussy for being afraid 103 stories up in the air in a glass box look i i look i think  you're a pussy but why not because of that that's you know that's a different conversation then yeah  i think you're a pussy because you you won't defend your your wife i would if i had to defend my wife  not if it was if it was wolves puerto ricans or uh black guys you wouldn't i saw that walk away 
[03:54:30]  the great i guarantee if there was a group of guys at night and they were like we're gonna get  the fuck out of here and you went to grab her and leave they went no just you you'd be like okay  all right honey i'll be back i'm gonna get some help you know where i go fuck i because i knew i  couldn't you'd be better off leaving you because i just get the shit kicked out of me and then i'd be  there when you'd have to just watch her yeah yeah immobily yeah so you barely just running and trying to  grab a cop like that guy who was in the movie theater yeah aurora you'd be better off just 
[03:55:00]  running and trying to find somebody in shape and tough like a like what like excuse me could you  help my wife for the guys that used to defend new york city guardian angels oh god look for curtis  liwa yeah try to look for a satin red jacket and a beret and this is the guy who's helping me  yeah it was always some uh it was always some white guy and a nerdy black guy remember that yeah they  would just walk in they had an attitude walk like they could do anything yeah you know like 
[03:55:30]  they show up how many how many times how many jackets of those got ripped off and pissed on  shut the fuck up just slap his beret off his dumb head yeah how many times have you had to  defend your your wife's honor never you never you what about that new year's thing you were  talking about i know it's just like i'm never doing this again they would look at i don't know  who it was i don't know what the fuck it was i just i'm not doing this i don't go out during  halloween parades i don't do that shit in new york city i always have to yell at  her to not because she gets road rage really bad your wife oh yeah really yeah she got a  little temper really it's kind of hot and i always have to yell at her to not do it in parking lots 
[03:56:00]  why because that's where we're stopped and if somebody decides i'm gonna fight this bitch right  now then that's now that's me in the passenger seats problem here's my problem what if a girl  like a tough girl wants to beat the shit out of your girl do you let it go down do you break it up  violently what do you do i think you got to just try to stand in between because you can't hit the  other girl so the girl hits you now she punches you in the face if she punches i guess you could if 
[03:56:30]  she punches you in the face then you could probably like shove her okay so you shove her and she doesn't  move oh she's bigger than you oh fuck like a big girl yeah like this is bitches like i'm gonna  fuck you and fuck you you motherfucker she starts punching you in the face i probably try to like  just trip her or something so i didn't have to actually punch her i think i just let my chick  go at it you would just be like look this is a girl i'd let it yeah like a like a karate teacher  all right go ahead yeah work this up and then and then when somebody gets like hurt or something 
[03:57:00]  happens all right that's it it's over it's over yeah and then break it up but you'd wait until  somebody was on the ground even if it was your chick what if your chick was like why wouldn't you  jump in earlier because you were fucking yapping you need to learn a lesson it's called consequence  in life next apparently your parents didn't teach you that you're fucking loud mouth because i'm not  yelling at people in cars that are bigger than me right but i like you girl i wouldn't want to see  a good heart right so i'd have to beat up the big girl yeah here's here's the thing too i learned  don't get out of the car yeah that's a key i i learned that by i woke up four hours later in a 
[03:57:30]  hospital and my i didn't look like me because i got out of the car really yeah i was with this chick who  i was in love with and we pulled up in front of her house and then there was lights big headlights  from a truck behind us and she went oh shit louis and i went what is this a movie i go who's louis  she goes my my ex or whatever my recently ex like two days ago ex or some god in a trunk  yeah and i go i'll i go i'll talk to him that's all i remember that's it that's it
