<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony President's Day special was a politically charged broadcast featuring a mix of in-studio guests and phone calls.  The show opened with a “worst of” compilation of politically themed segments, prominently featuring Ann Coulter.  Coulter, known for her outspoken conservative views, engaged in humorous and often contentious banter with the hosts.  Her discussions covered a wide range of topics, including her disdain for debating liberals (recounting a debate with a "homeless woman"), her strong opinions on the proposed mosque at Ground Zero, and her criticisms of figures like Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, James Carville, and Bill O’Reilly.  She frequently used strong language and made provocative statements. The segment also touched on 9/11 conspiracy theories, the birther movement, and the perceived intolerance of college campuses.  Listeners called in, some expressing anger at Coulter's presence and her commentary, with one identifying as a first responder voicing particular outrage.  The segment also referenced Jesse Ventura’s infamous walkout and included mentions of Sean Hannity and Pete Dominick.  Coulter’s personal anecdotes, including details about her childhood and interactions with other media personalities, were also shared.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Coulter's views and personality.

Following the Coulter segment, the show featured an in-studio interview with Jimmy McMillan, the "Rent is Too Damn High" party candidate.  This interview included discussions of his political platform, focusing on lowering rent in New York, interspersed with humorous banter and McMillan's personal anecdotes, including his past as a private investigator, his experiences in the Vietnam War, his time as a stripper, and his medical condition, priapism. He frequently used vulgar and sexually suggestive language.

The show then transitioned to a multi-part segment beginning with more discussion with McMillan about his platform, which extended to achieving self-sufficiency for New York State and improving family life.  This was followed by a discussion on conspiracy theories with callers and Alex Jones joining via phone. Jones discussed his views on 9/11, the JFK assassination, the New World Order, government manipulation of weather, CIA drug trafficking, and the plans of a global elite.  The hosts and callers offered skeptical responses to his claims, which were supported by Jones's references to declassified documents and government reports. The segment with Jones ended abruptly while he was still on the line.  A brief preview of an upcoming call with Sean Hannity concluded this portion, teasing a discussion about the 2010 election results.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to a phone conversation with Sean Hannity.  The conversation began with a post-election analysis focusing on the Republican victory and Harry Reid’s surprising re-election, which Hannity described as a “massacre.”  The discussion ranged from political issues like the national debt and healthcare reform to potential 2012 presidential candidates (mentioning Palin, Gingrich, Christie, Jindal, and Rubio).  Hannity defended Palin against media criticism.  He also criticized Opie's political knowledge, leading to a debate about New York’s high taxes and the portrayal of successful individuals.  Hannity discussed government overreach regarding free speech and the role of special interest groups and corporations in censorship.  His views on gay marriage and the role of parents versus public schools in shaping values were also discussed, with Hannity revealing personal Christian beliefs while acknowledging he didn’t impose them on others.  He also shared a humorous anecdote about his quick marriage.  Later, Pete Dominick joined the call, offering a contrasting perspective on healthcare, triggering a debate about the American system versus those of other developed nations. The segment ended with further banter between the hosts and a mention of Jimmy "The Greek" being present.

A segment focusing on healthcare in America followed, beginning with Opie’s assertion that certain sectors shouldn’t be for-profit.  The discussion expanded into Obamacare and included Opie’s proposed solutions, including the use of “undercover patients.”  Aaron Carroll was mentioned as a frequent guest who Opie deemed "boring."  This segment included heated and profane calls from "James in Maryland" and "Joe in Vegas," both aggressively debating Pete Dominick about the Canadian and American healthcare systems respectively.  The arguments frequently devolved into personal insults.  Finally, Jesse Ventura appeared as a guest, engaging in a heated and profane debate with Jim Norton and Opie about governmental overreach, profiling, and the treatment of enemy combatants, ultimately culminating in Ventura’s abrupt departure from the show. The hosts reacted with amusement and praised Jim Norton for his handling of the situation, expressing no concern about Ventura’s future appearances.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Ventura's departure.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  President's Day is a time to honor our forefathers, the men elected to the highest office in the  land. The men sworn to uphold and protect the Constitution of the United States. More  importantly, it's a time to stay home from work, maybe get a good deal on a mattress, 
[00:00:30]  and listen to a bunch of boobs on the O.P. and Anthony show attempt to talk politics. This  is the O.P. and Anthony President's Day special. Here are your hosts, Sam and E-Rock.  It's the worst of O.P. and Anthony. My name is E-Rock, and primetime Sam Roberts, of course,  does this as well. It's a themed worst of. Themed. Yes, of course it is, E-Rock. Themed. It's  President's Day, and so we're looking at some of the classic political bits in recent O&A  history. What's the theme? It's politically based for President's Day. Some of the in-studio 
[00:01:00]  guests are going to be Jesse Ventura, of course the famous walkout, Pete Dominick, Sean Hannity  is going to be calling in, and Coulter in studio, and of course, from the Rent This Too Damn  High party, Jimmy McMillan. Themed. Let's start the show. Sam, this is one of the guests we thought  we'd never get in studio, and not because of their A-list stature, but because this  person just doesn't like to get up in the morning. She is an A-lister in the political 
[00:01:30]  world. That's Ann Coulter. Yes, the woman herself, Ann Coulter, certainly leans to the  right more so than the left. She would usually claim to like to burn down the whole left side,  but she's on the show. A lot of you are probably saying, wow, what a great guest booking, and  a lot of you are probably saying, what the fuck is this? Why would they say that?  It's liberals. Oh. Well, even liberals. I mean, I don't understand. Anybody who wholeheartedly  agrees with Ann Coulter, or fights with Ann Coulter, is just, I mean, she's just doing  her thing. If you're actually, why argue? She's just doing her thing. It's like arguing 
[00:02:00]  with Sam. Yes! It's impossible to win, because we're not going to let you. You're just doing  that thing you do. We just argue for the sake of arguing. We don't care. Yeah, we do the  thing. Are you shades? I'm not going to tell you who I am, but Ann Coulter is going to come  on the Opie and Anthony show. Ew. Right now, I'm going to be Mr. White. I don't know  what you're talking about. It's the Opie and Anthony President's Day special.  Hi, Ann. Hello. What's going on? Ann Coulter. How are you? Dressed for TV. I like this. 
[00:02:30]  Yes, I am. Sorry we all look like slobs. I know. It's radio. We would have put our TV  clothes on today, too, if we knew she was. Wearing our dumb T-shirts with stuff on it. No, you  guys look fabulous, and you're much better than the liberal I was just on with. Oh, who  was that? I don't know why they keep putting me on with this homeless woman. And I said  to the producer, could you get her resume? Why aren't you just bringing in a homeless  person to debate me? Because a homeless person does have more on the resume. And I know liberals 
[00:03:00]  are chickens. And they won't debate me, so we're running out of options. But still, come  on, seriously. Who was she? Something. Someone you've never heard of, Tanya Acker. And no,  I do not know what community college she went to. She has worked for no one. She has written  nothing. Where was she? Like TV? Radio? CBS early show. That's why you're seeing me here  in the middle of the night. Oh, right. This is like the middle of the night. I was so excited 
[00:03:30]  I could do this show because I was getting up at the crack of dawn. Early. Normally, I'm asleep  now. Yeah. Yeah, I got your email. Didn't you and Ann drink or something together? I  saw a picture. I don't drink. We went out. Yes, we did. After, what were we doing? Red  eye or something? Yeah. That was fun. Yeah, it was. It was a blast. You like to tip them  back after you do some debating? I like Ann. She can keep up a couple of beverages. There's  nothing wrong with that. You do a show, you're laughing. You had a good time. I just want to know  what her poison is. That's all. A little bit of everything. Yeah, pretty much anything. Really? 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, which reminds me of a drinking point I'd like to make. They always say that mixing  alcohol is what gets you drunk, but whenever you hear people say this, it'll be like, I  started with a Bloody Mary, and then I had some wine, and then I had three beers. It's  not the mixing. It's that you've had so much alcohol. Yeah, it doesn't matter what you're  drinking. If you're drinking all day and all night, you're going to feel like crap.  So are you coming to my debate with James Carville? I hear about this. I just 
[00:04:30]  heard about it. Actually, Jimmy just plugged it. Atlantic City. We just gave it a plug,  right? Atlantic City. Wow. Now that's going to be... You live in New Jersey. It's probably  a short drive for you. No, I'm Long Island. It's a mansion in Long Island. But Atlantic  City is my second home. I do tend to go down there a few times. The Red Eye Boys are coming.  Are they? You should go down there. Go down there. Check it out. That is going to be a good  one, man. You've been on shows with him before. Yeah, yeah. And what do you think of 
[00:05:00]  his whole style? He tends to lean left. What do you think of his debating style? He's  a little rough. I think he is like the Robin Williams of political commentary. He talks  fast, so people think they're supposed to laugh, but nothing is funny. I've said this  for years. Wow. Right? You've got to be funny. Yeah. Oh, look at this. My phone. I'll make  it a tie. Thank you. And you're like, wait, that means nothing. It's not funny. And everyone's 
[00:05:30]  rolling going, wow, off the cuff. He's so funny. Stream of consciousness. Tell a joke, for  God's sake. It's not funny. And he's the same way. Yeah. Yeah. And he's really odd when  he, before he shaved his head, it was odd, but now he's got that slick, like, alien look  to him. He really looks like an alien. He looks like they're going to find, like, hooker driver's  licenses, like, in a little compartment in his house somewhere. Oh, they were all missing.  They call them souvenirs. Yeah, exactly. Little mementos. He's not going to try to punch you, 
[00:06:00]  right? I don't think he'll pull the Rick Lazio move. He seems like that type of guy, if he gets  frustrated enough, that he might, like, strangle a bitch or something. Yeah, yeah. I'd like to see that,  though. What kind of subjects do you think you two are going to touch on? You know, I  have no idea. It's a one-hour debate. I mean, it's Atlantic City, so I'm sure it's supposed  to be fun, presumably the election. I'm sure, yeah, the election. Of course, all I will be  talking about is the mosque, because I am so enjoying the position the Democrats have decided  to take. Yes! It's fantastic when you watch it and go, what are they thinking? Although 
[00:06:30]  Harry Reid and I think Howard Dean, I was surprised, actually said it was, I think, important.  I was actually very surprised he did that. He's trying so hard to not lose his job.  All he does is say ethnic things. Yeah, yeah. The fucking, the Puerto Ricans, the blacks,  he's, like, offended two big groups already, and now he's, like, the Muslims. All right,  you get in with them, too. Fuck yourself. Everybody moves. Kind of like Harry Reid. He hates  everyone. It's, uh, it is looking grim, and they just, the Democrats keep, like, really 
[00:07:00]  tripping up, uh, more and more as November comes around. Yeah, yeah, I think the problem  is when your entire, um, you know, advisor squad came from Zabar's. Now that you're not  going to get, you know, the pulse of the American people. No, no. No, mosque at ground zero, that's  fine. They are so out of touch with what the people are feeling and thinking. They go completely  against it and think that they're, they're patting each other on the back, like, yeah, look at 
[00:07:30]  what we're doing. Yes. We're changing the country. We're, it's a whole new era of, of  what? The, the country hating what you're doing to it. It's astounding me. I like, I say this,  I'm surprised David Patterson took the position he did, which is, I actually, I'm pleasantly  surprised with David Patterson, who was, I say, look, let's get this out. We'll meet, find  a better place for it. Right. You know. Do you think, um, nobody told him he was talking  into a ruler? But I mean, the fact was, he still made an effort. No one heard him say 
[00:08:00]  it. No, that, that was good. I think that's why the New York Times kept attacking Patterson.  As far as the Democrats go, he's actually fairly reasonable. Yeah. Yeah. But you know, I just,  I want to have a seminar to teach Democrats what courage is because both Bloomberg and Obama,  you know, they were advised, oh, this is going to be so brave. You're going to be so good.  And stand in front of a group of Muslims and tell them at the Ramadan dinner, no less, tell  them you want a mosque at ground zero. So we get to standing ovation. He brags about the 
[00:08:30]  standing ovation. And then five minutes later, oh, I wasn't saying anything about the mosque  at ground zero. No, no, that wasn't the mosque. No, I didn't say it. I wasn't talking about  it. I didn't say it. So the first time we get cowardice masquerading as courage. And  the second time we get cowardice masquerading as principle. Yeah. Yeah. But it's still  cowardice. You think he's afraid of, of, of, uh, Muslims not liking him or of appearing  Islamophobic? Like Obama, is he, is he afraid of appearing like that he's, that he's, uh, 
[00:09:00]  against Islam or is, or is he actually just afraid of, uh, actually being, you're just  doing what I'm saying. Is he, I do, but I don't even think it gets to that level of,  I seriously, if we go and I would so recommend this as a little field trip for your radio show  send, Ooh, Jim, you'd be good at this. You got to send a man on the street and just,  just start asking people questions at Zaybars. And I'm telling you, they will all say, Oh  no, I think a mosque at ground zero is fine. Yeah. You are dealing with crazy people.  It's like, they're like ACL yours. And Timothy Dolan came out again. I was also surprised 
[00:09:30]  that the, uh, he's the archbishop, I think in New York came out and said that he thinks he  talked about the convent by what Auschwitz. Yeah. And sometimes you have to, the Pope stepped  in. How about one Islamic leader step in and go, we understand we have the legal right,  but it's in poor taste. Let's be sensitive. You're a crazy person. You know how long way  that would go? It sounds way too logical. You're right. It does sound logical and it  won't happen. Anytime that question has been posed to any Muslims that I've seen on the  news and the chat shows and everything else, they will avoid that. They will instantly turn 
[00:10:00]  to the legal right of religion and how it's in the constitution of freedom of religion.  We all understand that part of the argument. And it's like, we know, no one's denying the  fact that you can do it. Yes. The thing people are upset with is the fact that you are doing  it. There's a difference. We were watching this morning and you actually pointed it out.  The guy was, they asked him about like, uh, putting it there and being in poor taste and  he just avoided the question. Avoided it. Yeah. And went to the legal, it's like, no one's 
[00:10:30]  questioning your legal right. We know you have the right. That's why it would be a nice  thing for you not to do. Right. But that's their answer to it. And no one's arguing that  point. They're answering the thing no one cares about. We understand our constitution.  We understand that there is a right for them to build the thing there. But why are you  doing it? Don't you understand it's insensitive? Well, the founding fathers wouldn't have thought  insensitive. All right. Here he goes again. They just don't understand. You could also legally  put a dildo fucking factory there, but you don't, you don't want to do that. You know, Obama, 
[00:11:00]  and I said this yesterday, the problem with Obama is, is liberals don't think that he's  because they're really, they're closet racist. A lot of them, he's an elitist and he's an  electoral snob and they don't think that a black guy can be a snob. He is, he is an  elitist guy. He thinks in an elitist way. That's not realistic. That's not being in touch  with the American people. Everyone's against it. And he's so surrounded by the people that  are exactly like that. They pat each other. I could just imagine him and Pelosi and everybody 
[00:11:30]  just patting themselves on the back on, we're doing things. We're changing things. Not looking  at the public going, stop it. What are you doing to us? I like Nancy Pelosi. I can't  even joke. I couldn't even say it and finish. Well, now she, uh, she suggested now we saw  us on the news today that, uh, she suggested that we start looking into people that are,  uh, against the mosque and where this money is coming from. Oh yeah. Now they want to 
[00:12:00]  send all of us to Guantanamo. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That is just set all the, um, combatants,  the enemy combatants free and put people that are maybe contributing a little money to the  other side, uh, in Guantanamo. It really does amaze me the, uh, stupidity that goes on and  the elitism, uh, uh, on, on the left. It's, it's amazing. Yeah. Yeah. There's no one in  the room to say, no, not, not a good idea. How radically left is Carvel? I always say 
[00:12:30]  his name is Carvel. I know I always do that. Um, creepy face James, we'll call him. How is  he really? Cause he seems like a bright guy. He's not a dumb guy. I mean, how far left is  I can't tell. Cause I can never understand what he's saying. So who knows? Thank you.  What do you guys do? What you talking about? What did you just say? By the way, if you look  up transcripts on Nexus more than anyone else who was ever a guest on TV, that's great. 
[00:13:00]  Do you actually look up transcripts? That's what we need to do. We don't do our homework with anything.  Oh, knee jerk. You want to go through transcripts? Fuck that.  He do. We got a knee jerk, idiots. Did you, uh, watch Keith Overman's mosque thing?  The special comment? Yeah. I love when he does a special comment.  Of course I linked to it on my webpage. It was, it was, I, I, I set the Tivo machine for that one.  It's astounding. You realize it's on YouTube and you, you can't even  fucking comment on his piece. He's got a comment. Disabled comments. Disabled the fucking comments. 
[00:13:30]  That's on an issue where everyone has a lot to say. He's a douchebag. Yeah.  No, exactly. And that whole mosque issue. I mean, I was watching that special comment thinking  the mosque at ground zero, it's like we've designed a pompous douchebag trap and you know,  you call the pompous douchebag exterminator over and he lays out the glue traps. Okay.  We're going to put a mosque at ground zero and right-wingers are against it. And you wake up  in the morning and oh, look who's still stuck in the glue. It's Keith Overman. It's the pompous 
[00:14:00]  douchebag trap. It's amazing how people come out and they, there's a great article in the post  today about, uh, some, some editorial about how if you would, it's just nothing has happened there.  Nothing has been built. It's an embarrassment. Nine years later. Yeah. And it's fucking nothing.  And they blame me. A lot of them are blaming Pataki saying that whole contest, but that was  already 2006. Yeah. Now that was a few years back a ways also on, on September 12th, 2001. 
[00:14:30]  Do you honestly think if you went out and asked anybody, should we build a moth? Like the rubble  is still smoking. Do you honestly think people would be like, yeah, we should be tolerant to  the Muslim. How do people just forget the, the, the horror of that day of the 11th and think that  on the 12th, people would feel any better. Right. Right. Or years later. And by the way,  you remind me from Keith from the pompous douchebag special comment, one hilarious moment of it was 
[00:15:00]  when he indignantly points out that no one has done anything with this building since 2001.  And then, and then, and then, you know, sort of, sort of slips in because it was destroyed  in the crash in the attack on the world trade center. Some of the plane fell through the building.  He just slips that in incidentally. Like you're not going to notice. Yeah. Oh, it's not really  that close to the site. Really? It was hit by the plane. Yeah. Dunce. I can't stand listening 
[00:15:30]  to, uh, him ranting on this. Uh, Jon Stewart's another one who on, on the daily show, he just  started talking about and really bashing, uh, the Republican stance on this thing and getting  behind the liberals that, you know, uh, this is a constitution again, says that he should be able  to build this blah, blah, blah, blah. Uh, how about we go back to, uh, September 11th and the, the weeks  after went on his show where he's just weeping, weeping on his show, crying about what happened to 
[00:16:00]  the towers and everything. Right. And apparently he forgot too. I got, everyone just forgets.  Not everyone. No, no, I have not forgotten. I have such disdain for, uh, uh, for the religion  itself. I'm sorry. Whenever I hear this is a peaceful religion that is being marred by this  Islamic extremists, I've not seen any of the peaceful part. I'm sorry. Come out, show me. 
[00:16:30]  Be, be a vocal against what's going on. Be peaceful. Let me see that. It's not this archaic,  uh, prehistoric religion based on, on violence and, uh, uh, misogyny, but they don't, I don't see  that part of it. Right. And where is it? They keep attacking. You have Fort Hood, you have the diaper  bomber, you have the snipers down in DC, you have the Times Square bomber. I mean, just, you know,  off the top of your head, these are more attacks on U.S. soil since 9-11. Although I do note there 
[00:17:00]  were none between when we invaded Iraq and Obama became president. Right. That's pretty amazing. No  attacks on U.S. soil. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's also, um, oh, fuck. I forgot. I looked  completely lost. I completely blanked. Like my, I had a thought that completely went away.  That's because she smells good. She does smell good. But it was something about, I think,  ground zero. Oh, how about that? You know, they're going to put a mosque down there. I 
[00:17:30]  just reset. That's what happened. I just reset. And on my Twitter, we got this guy, Saxgod.  He, he's for the mosque and he's, every time we mentioned the mosque, he's all over Twitter.  Uh huh. His recent comment here is the reason they are building it there is because it's close  to close for all the New York City Muslims to go to. So is that good enough for you guys?  No, it's not. No, it's not. Nobody lives down there. What is he talking about? Yes. Close 
[00:18:00]  for the, well, you know what? How about you, uh, you build it somewhere else and then all  those Muslims that have to walk or drive a little further to get there can use that time  to reflect on the atrocities that were committed where that mosque was, where they thought it  should be. It actually was a great place for 19 of them to converge nine years ago. I, what  I was going to say is, oh, this is part of my, you always hear like how we don't understand  Islam. We have to reach out to Islam, but it's like, they don't understand Americans 
[00:18:30]  either. It's like, we're suckers. If you're nice to us. And if they, if they would voluntarily  move this, if one vocal member in the Islamic world would go, you know what? We really,  people would go, fuck man. These are not as unreasonable. It would be like, it's like when someone  like holds the door for you, you go, son of a bitch. I can't believe I didn't like  that guy. We're easy. Americans are easy. Yeah. Just don't be such a, Hamas came out  for it. They should have just walked away and said, well, Hamas is backing it. Hamas is  backing it. Yeah. That's nasty. 
[00:19:00]  Ahmadinejad has donated a members only jacket to go in the lobby.  That is members only jacket. Let's get someone from the other side. Cause we're on, we're all  on one side here in studio today. Jim in Boston. What's up?  Yeah. I want to preface my statement. Number one, I don't want you to beat up on me. Number  two, I'm not a, I'm not a religious guy. I'm far from it. But help me out here a little  bit. Okay. First of all, I have a little bit of a problem tying those fuckers who went into 
[00:19:30]  the towers and your mainstream Muslim guy, because I compare it to your regular Christian  guy who goes to church every day. But then you've got like the KKK who claim they're Christians  and all that. Now I just find a hard time connecting the two. And because I have a hard time with  that, I say to myself, well, if you do build a mosque next to, you know, that area, I don't, 
[00:20:00]  I don't know New York that well, but close to these towers, I say to myself, well, if they're  the mainstream Muslims or Islamists, whatever you want to call them, I don't see how that's a big  difference. You know, I don't see how that's, I wouldn't call that offensive because if they're  just mainstream people, they could be just like Christians. And then there's KKK crazies, you know?  It's a sensitivity issue. It's a rub it in your face issue, as I see also. There are a lot of 
[00:20:30]  victims and victims' families and first responders and people that have been affected for the rest of  their lives that don't want this there. So let me ask you right there. So basically what there is,  is there's an undercurrent of real, if you think about it, of racism or prejudice.  No, I don't think that's right. And just a little side note here, the KKK today is entirely composed 
[00:21:00]  of FBI informants. And they're not, they're not, you know, committing their, they never were.  Let's go back a hundred years in America. They weren't, you know, citing the Lord's Prayer as  they were burning a cross or lynching a black. These guys were, you know, shouting Allah Akbar  when, when that Dr. Hassan stood up at Fort Hood and, and guns down our troops. He's shouting out  Allah Akbar. The terrorists are doing it in the name of religion. And, and yeah, okay, they're, 
[00:21:30]  they're peaceful Muslims and they aren't the same ones, but this is, there are a lot of them who aren't  peaceful and they're using the religion specifically as part of the violence. Okay. So in that case,  I'm going to just make a humorous comment. That's always a very natural way to set up a joke,  by the way, humorous comment, semi-colon. Get out of the way. Here comes the funny.  Here comes the funny. Here comes the funny. Let me ease into it. We have a mosque at the White House, 
[00:22:00]  the Pentagon, all the time. We should have three or 400 of them all over the city so they won't blow up  the most critical areas in our country. No, because the only people that will blow up mosques  are Islamic extremists. Right. They'll go in, they'll gun down people. We have to sit there and  pay attention to rules of engagement where if enemy combatants run into a mosque, we can't even look  at the mosque, nevermind bomb it or shoot at it. Yet they will go in and hack their people to pieces 
[00:22:30]  in the name of Allah. I know. You see it. You see it. I mean,  you see the suicide bombers in Iraq and the crazy shit. They're killing their own people when they  do stuff like that. So I understand your point, but I just thank you for the clarification. I just,  I don't like to, I just see religion in general. Most religions, if you look at the way they're  written, they're quite, they're quite peaceful. I mean, you look at Christianity, you go with the  Ten Commandments, you're doing okay. But it's the people who teach the religions who screw 
[00:23:00]  everything up. It's a lot of religions. Uh, if you, if you do read the ancient texts are very  violent. They have, um, this, uh, undertone of, of everything should be done for God, not for your  personal interests. And there are things like stonings, beheadings, a lot of smitings, a lot of  smitings. A lot of people being smitings. I like the smitings. Oh, who doesn't love to be smit,  smited? But, but what I'm saying is, uh, in, in the modern world, these religions have been 
[00:23:30]  updated for the time. You can't, you know, stone people. I'm sorry. But you know, it is even more  than that. There is of the three major world religions. Only one of them was founded by a  warrior. Ah, yes. That's Islam. Yes. Right, right, right. Yeah. I mean, Christianity is purely  peaceful. And the Old Testament, well, okay, God is being a gracious God. He's trying to keep the  Jews alive in the desert, um, gives them all these rules. Okay. It may not apply today. And there was a 
[00:24:00]  lot of warfare going on, but it's not like Moses was admired for slaughtering infidels.  Yes. Have they polled, uh, Muslims on this whole thing? No, I don't know.  If they posed, polled American Muslims, American Muslims. And where, where would the percentages  be on this thing? They probably don't even poll them because they're afraid of being  looked at as anti-Muslim. But people that say. Don't talk to them. Don't poll them.  People that say like. Wow. Jesus. Am I a mind reader? Wow. And what is President Obama's 
[00:24:30]  religion? Oh, that's something else. Okay. A lot of people think that, uh, Obama is a Muslim.  18%. 43%. They don't know. And that's the highest. Well, the weird thing is they didn't even  give the correct answer as one of the options. Atheist. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe he is atheist.  Totally. All liberals are. So here's, here's a name for you. Nancy Pelosi. She's in the news  today. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do you think it's her sex appeal that keeps her in the limelight? 
[00:25:00]  She is a pisser. She's like four characters in the fucking creep show. We're not going to get to a lot  of phone calls, but this guy goes, uh, wants to ask Anne how much she would like to swing  a sledgehammer in Nancy Pelosi's face. Her big gavel, her dumb gavel. She walked down  the street with that day. You know, that is a good question. I actually kind of like her  because she gives you the democratic position without the nonsense. Okay. Just tell us the  truth. We're going to check in with Nancy Pelosi. She wants to investigate people who are  opposed to the mosque. Yes. You know, they're all secretly thinking that, but only the Congresswoman 
[00:25:30]  from San Francisco can come out and say what all Democrats are thinking. She said she would  like to investigate where this funding is coming from for this grand conspiracy of people that  are against the mosque. Yeah. Who's paying you? Yeah. I, well, you know, I can't tell  you. I don't want Pelosi finding out where all this money is coming from. The Borgata.  Yeah. How about, yeah, the Borgata. How, how about the, uh, image of the towers being, um, 
[00:26:00]  it, uh, being hit by planes and collapsing is what people are thinking about. Not, not  this conspiracy, not money coming in, not this grand plot to get the Democrats out. It's  not, they, believe me, they were tripping over their own dicks before this happened. And  then they come up with this and Obama can't keep his mouth shut on it. Now Pelosi comes out  and she's again now, Oh, who's behind this? It's gotta be someone. And she said in response, 
[00:26:30]  because they want to find out who's funding the mosque. They want to see if it's Iran or  they want to find out. And she said, well, while, cause she's for that investigation, but  she said, well, while we're investigating, we should check out who's funding the opposition.  Well, all right, well, how about you narrow it down? Who shouldn't we investigate? Asshole.  Cause you fall on one of those sides. You either are funding it or you're not funding it.  You should absolutely look into who, where some of this money is coming from.  trace it back. See if it's coming from terrorist organizations or, or Saudi Arabia,  which is just a synonym for what you said. Exactly that. But we kissed our ass. 
[00:27:00]  That's every president that's conservative. That's liberal. There's no president that cannot  be in bed with the Saudis. I'm so proud of the relationship. When Bush was holding hands in  the garden, in the, in the garden, it looked romantic actually. Yeah. Obama bowed and that was  irritating. But the handholding thing too, it's like, why all of a sudden assimilate to  that homoerotic culture really annoyed me. Yeah. Yeah. You know how much money you have  to have to have a picture taken with the American president handholding in a garden? You got to 
[00:27:30]  have a lot of dough. It's a thousand bucks a plate and a shitty dinner. Yeah. That is  embarrassing. Yeah. But Pelosi calling for the investigation and then Obama not being able  to keep his mouth shut. He couldn't keep his mouth shut. He just couldn't. The best thing  for him to do would have been not mention it at all. And then, all right, then he comes  out and starts talking about the first responders' healthcare. Oh yeah. Out of nowhere. He hasn't 
[00:28:00]  mentioned this in years. He hasn't talked about it. First responders, you know, are dying because  they were down there breathing in all this shit. I think those got paid. Now we're dealing  with post-traumatic stress syndrome from people who were generally in the area. In the area.  Is that what you think is going on now? Yeah. I think America responded pretty well to the  first responders breathing in the debris. Are we up to the eighth and ninth responders? 
[00:28:30]  Yeah. We're kind of down on the totem pole a little there. Now we're getting the people  who watch it on CNN and we're upset. I think it's pretty calculated, though, that after taking  a beating on his position on the mosque, that he comes out now and within a couple of days  is like, and we'll take care of the first responders. Well, they would kill him. They  said he's not addressing people who are down there. He talks about the mosque, but doesn't  talk about taking care of these people. And then he's like, yes, we'll take care of them. 
[00:29:00]  Please forget about my mosque statements. What do you think happens after the mosque is  built? I think people forget the response. People forget. Before we get to the mosque being  built, because these words will never again cross my lips. Bill O'Reilly had a good point.  Wow.  Do you not love O'Reilly? I thought you guys were like, I've never seen you on the show.  You know, it's kind of a love hate relationship. Sometimes I think he is so brilliant, every  man. And sometimes, as he knows, I want to strangle him. But he had a really good point 
[00:29:30]  last night, I think, which was, you know, they have to do a lot of renovations because,  you know, a plane fell on it. He said, no construction worker is going to build that.  You are not going to get a construction worker. Which I thought, that's actually a pretty good  point.  You get a nice union, all-American construction worker.  You're going to get a teamster building the mosque?  Yeah.  Hell fucking no.  I could see some shoddy workmanship going into that one.  A little ceiling collapse during their first gathering. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, a very thin floor.  People are thin.  They'll bring in the UAW from Detroit. You know the way you guys have been building those  cars? Do it to the mosque.  What's your problem with Bill O'Reilly? You know how I call Obermann a douchebag? I say  the same thing about O'Reilly. I don't like O'Reilly either. I don't like either guy.  What's your issue with him?  Well, there's no particular issue. It's just sometimes.  Every once in a while, he's just ridiculous.  And when he can be really great, and then you're watching, and if you care about politics, 
[00:30:30]  there it is. He's really hitting it hard. What did he come back on? I think the Arizona  law. He just came back from vacation. It was like the best O'Reilly ever. And you're  watching, and you're totally intrigued. And then we have Culture Warriors. Wait a second.  Don't make me watch MSNBC. No.  What is Culture Warriors? I don't watch O'Reilly. What's Culture Warriors?  It's like, name the third child on Brady Bunch. Is he just trying to expand the audience  a little bit? But he's got the numbers. He doesn't need to. 
[00:31:00]  Right. No, I think it's just easy. He's been taking some heat for doing anything on Lindsay  Lohan. If he brings that up, he makes the light.  Well, he went after Jennifer Aniston, right?  For what?  What'd she do?  Well, because she's telling women they don't need a man to have a kid.  Oh, he was right about that.  He was very upset about that.  No, that was good. No, I like that. But I don't like the silly things at the end.  Sometimes I think he'll take a stance, too, because he's been a little too far to one  side, so he takes the other stance just so he doesn't take so much crap. 
[00:31:30]  Right.  Like, I look and go, he really doesn't believe that. But he's just saying it.  But his instincts are so good.  He is, I mean, the whole persona is completely accurate. And I love this about him. This  is the love side. He is like the sort of guy who would just walk up to Barbara Walters  at a cocktail party and ask her how old she is. Right? And I love that about him in an  interview, that he will just say the same thing that all of us are thinking, but might 
[00:32:00]  not ask.  Yeah, I've seen him do that a few times. Yeah.  I think Gutfeld is the smartest guy over there. I really do. Gutfeld is a really underrated  smart, because he's funny, but he's a really bright dude, man. Gutfeld, I think, always  has the best take on things. Even when I don't agree with him, I think that's a smart take  to have.  Including the gay Muslim bar.  Oh, that was a great idea.  Just put, oh God, put the gay bar right next to the mosque.  I've been collecting names for the bar on my website, anncoulter.com. You can look 
[00:32:30]  it up over there. You with the computer.  Yeah, Danny's got it right there.  And there are some fantastic names coming in. I think Suspicious Packages is the winning  choice thing.  That's a good one. Oh, damn, that's good.  I predict, I say that they, and I could be an optimist asshole. I don't think it's going  to get built there. I think it's going to get moved.  I don't know. There's the developer saying, nope, we're building it right here.  Does the developer have an interest on selling the property? Meaning, is it the developer's  building? 
[00:33:00]  I would gather.  Well, then, of course, the developer's going to say, that's almost like if you're going  to rent your apartment out, and everyone's trying to say, no, rent the apartment from  them, and you're like, ah, no one's rented this apartment in years. So the developer's  just trying to make money, I guess, right? I mean, am I wrong about that? So wouldn't  the developer have a big interest in going, they're never going to move?  It's pretty cheap, by the way.  Yeah.  The whole building is like $4 million.  Really?  That's what I heard, yeah.  Well, I guess this is going to take probably $4 million to renovate it.  Yeah, yeah, a few more million.  Yeah, sure.  You've got to pull a landing gear out of the basement. 
[00:33:30]  But I mean, co-ops are that much in New York.  This is an entire building.  I think they're going to move it. When the governor's involved, there's too many, Howard  Dean, there's too many prominent Democrats even speaking. Eventually, I think it will,  they'll find a compromise and they'll move it a couple blocks away. They'll give them  some kind of a tax break. Something will happen.  Saudi Arabia.  I agree.  Let's just move it there. Please. We've got enough with these friggin' silly roof-looking  things.  We've got a first responder on the line here. Chris on Long Island. Chris. 
[00:34:00]  How you doing? You guys got to get that fucking hole out of the fucking office, man.  She's just absorbing all the airwaves. She fucking sucks, man. Get off the air.  Well, why do you not, like, answer?  Because he has.  You keep saying she. Do you mean Steve? I don't want to leave.  Chris, explain, though, man. Make your point.  My God, man. All you guys are about is not having these fucking women on the air because  they fucking absorb all the airwaves. And all she does is talk every time you guys are 
[00:34:30]  trying to get something interesting out of your fucking mouth.  I think we're having a very back-and-forth conversation.  If you don't like Anne, at least say why you don't like her. Besides, she's not talking  too much. We're all talking together. Anne's a thousand times better than the fucking  callers stepping on us.  I'll tell you.  Yeah, what's your issue, sir? Just get to your issue.  Chris.  Happy birthday, guys.  Thanks, Chris.  Chris, what is your...  He's gone.  I mean, if you don't like Anne, that's fine, but explain why.  I can tell you he has post-traumatic stress syndrome from watching the towers collapse 
[00:35:00]  on CNN, and he was upset that I mentioned that that was what his post-traumatic stress  came from.  Oh, you think he's kind of...  All right.  I'm a first responder, and I'm mad at her.  You can handle people not liking you.  I've seen you.  Oh, please.  Make your point, though.  Wait, are there people who don't like me?  That goddamn line from...  What's her name?  Joy Behar's show.  Oh.  You didn't say it on the air, Jimmy.  We were laughing behind.  This was brilliant during the break.  And while on Larry King's show, Joy, who was acting as host, asked Anne if she would 
[00:35:30]  be waterboarded since she supported it, and responded by asking Joy if she would be  aborted since she supported abortion.  What a great comeback.  She had a laugh at that.  I mean...  She did.  That's hilarious.  She's a fun gal.  Goddamn funny, man.  Fun gal.  You like Joy, right?  I like Joy, too.  I like her, yeah, because she's actually funny.  Yeah.  And she always defends comics, so I...  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  I just recently did a...  I did her program. 
[00:36:00]  Yes, you did.  Thanks to Jimmy.  What was that?  Jimmy pimps me out to the shows that he goes on.  He, like, does recon and then goes, yeah, throw Anthony on this.  Listen, if somebody cancels, I have a friend.  Exactly.  I'm hosting again next Monday, I think.  Oh, yeah.  I was going to try to do it on Leading Town.  We asked for it, but you're aware.  Yeah.  That'll be...  It was great last time.  It was fun.  You were unbelievable.  I know.  It was a fun panel, though.  And by the way, that shows you how smart Greg Gutfeld is, because usually when the fill-in  guest is really, really funny, he is never invited back. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, you don't want to do it again.  Shit, he looks good.  Gutfeld knows I'm a one-a-week guy, though.  Like, by Tuesday, people will be like, we fucking get it.  You blink a lot.  Enough with this asshole.  Give us a break from the blinking.  Hey, this is Ann Coulter.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony President's Day special.  Sam, we'll continue on with Ann Coulter in part two coming up in just a moment.  Ann Coulter has her grip on the show, and her reign of terror has not yet concluded. 
[00:37:00]  The Ann Coulter saga continues on the Opie and Anthony show when we come back.  Here's another little spoiler for you.  Yeah.  Big fan of worst of the week.  Who is?  Ann Coulter.  Ooh.  For highbrow political discourse, in moments, this is the Opie and Anthony President's Day special on the virus.  The Opie and Anthony President's Day special continues on the virus.  Here are your hosts, Sam and E-Rock.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's a President's Day special, if you want to call it that. 
[00:37:30]  I'm E-Rock.  He's primetime Sam Roberts.  Well, we'll call it whatever we want them to call it.  It's President's Day.  E-Rock, what have we got lined up?  All right, Sam.  Part two of Ann Coulter in studio.  She's very opinionated.  Yeah.  The callers, some like her.  A lot of them don't, and there's a lot of energy in the room.  Eric, she's what we call in the media a polarizing figure.  Some love her.  Some hate her.  But at least you have an opinion about her.  And that's what counts.  You can put all the hate mail you want to, but as long as you have an opinion, that makes 
[00:38:00]  her...  And buy her books.  And buy her books just to shit on them.  Whatever you do with them, it still makes her better than you.  That's my school of thought.  Part two of Ann Coulter on the Opie and Anthony show.  Wait, I was talking about Ann.  Oh, I thought you were talking about you.  What are you talking about?  No, Ann.  It's the Opie and Anthony President's Day special.  We got Ann Coulter in the studio having a lot of fun with her.  And not bad to look at either.  Jesus Christ.  She's very lovely.  Saw you walking down the hall with those legs of yours.  Thank you.  Good thing.  If she was doing a handstand, it would look silly.  Saw you walking down the hall with those arms of yours. 
[00:38:30]  My God.  Legs for days.  And, you know, there's someone on the line saying that Ann should get a room.  Oh, jeez.  And I just watched that during the break because you're just cracking her up.  I'm sorry.  I'm strictly a traffic girl kind of guy.  But, I mean, it was some funny shit during the break.  Unfortunately, we had to take a break.  I know.  Talking about Jesse Ventura, Rosie O'Donnell.  Crazy people.  Crazy people in general.  It's those people that you can't convince that there wasn't a conspiracy with 9-11. 
[00:39:00]  And now I'm sure the phone's alive.  Yes, there wasn't.  And here we go.  We were talking about Jesse Ventura and his stupid thermite paint.  And I've reiterated this so many times.  You can't demolish a building.  If anyone's ever watched Discovery Channel and watched building demolition crews go in to a five-story building to try to bring it down, it takes, logistically, it's unbelievable what it takes to bring down that building.  You're going to take down 100 floors and set the explosives. 
[00:39:30]  And then they go, do you know for two weeks no one was in that building?  They sent construction workers in and they were working.  Still, for 10 years, you could have them drilling holes in stanchions and beams and putting dynamite in like Wile E. Coyote.  And we've never said this.  And you have to do it twice because you've got to take down two.  Yeah, both buildings.  When one would have done the job if you were going to do that.  What union, by the way, was sending members in? 
[00:40:00]  And if they weren't union, where was the giant rat?  Yeah, yeah, where was the big blow-up rat in front of the mic?  You can't put a fucking sink in without them protesting with a giant rat.  Non-union explosive planners.  We're from Explosive Planners Local 316.  And we protest these scabs that are planting explosives in termite paint.  It's the dumbest argument.  And then Rosie O'Donnell also got on.  We were talking about her.  And she had to chime in with her knowledge. 
[00:40:30]  And she goes, and the buildings came down, and it had to be demolition because you can't melt steel with fire.  It's like, hey, Rosie, how is steel made with fire?  They melt it, and they mold it into things with fire.  Yeah, they didn't have to turn it into liquid.  You don't mine for I-beams.  They don't dig in the ground, pull I-beams up, and throw it on a truck.  I also like your point that after putting all of the explosives in the buildings, they wait for two planes to hit before setting them off. 
[00:41:00]  And it still works flawlessly.  You know, all the explosives go off after two planes fly into it.  It was pulled off perfectly.  What a bunch of idiots.  You know what?  The other side of that, it's scary how many people believe just that.  That's what's scary, that you walk around with these people.  Because there's just blatant lies out there that they are putting forth as truth.  And they'll call you gatekeeper.  You're one of the gatekeepers. 
[00:41:30]  What is this?  What are we, LARPing?  What is this, a fantasy game?  Dude, those buildings took an hour and 42 minutes to put it.  Shut up.  They didn't.  You heard the fire chief said, blow the building.  Did he?  No, he didn't.  Did he say, blow the building?  Building 7 wasn't even damaged.  Oh, it wasn't?  It was on fire.  There was a fucking hole in the front from a landing gear.  I love that you know all the details of what their arguments are.  Because we've been through this. 
[00:42:00]  We've had them on.  You want to strangle them.  They've attacked us on the street when we used to broadcast live from one studio to another.  They're all these spoiled.  We've had Jesse Vittorio on.  He's part of that whole movement.  They're all these spoiled little college pukes.  Suburban kids, yeah.  Suburban kids that don't have a voice.  So they're like, listen to me.  Look at me.  I know the truth.  No, you don't.  Right.  Is it so out of the realm of possibility that people that have been attacking us for years 
[00:42:30]  decided they still don't like us, came across with a plan, caught us with our pants down,  and did this?  Is that so far, is that so crazy that you're actually accepting that explosives were planted  in the building?  I was talking to some, one of the girls who was, thank you, sweetie.  I was talking to one of the women who was, she was like, 19, who was arguing in favor of  the conspiracy.  And I'm like, what about the voice messages that were left by people who were, they said  there's garbage males in the plane. 
[00:43:00]  They said what was happening.  And she goes, well, those could have been voice modification.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like, do you really?  Come on.  Any conspiracy that involves more than one person will be exposed.  It's going to be exposed.  That's what we say.  People can't keep their mouth shut.  Their conspiracy theory, if it was a movie, I would go, this sucks.  Like, it's so unbelievable.  It stinks as a movie.  Never mind in real life.  It's ridiculous.  Right.  And right now we're getting the same thing with the birthers. 
[00:43:30]  We have, A, the short form being released, B, the head of that part of the hospital saying  this is all we released because the long form has the address and phone number of the delivering  physician.  We have not one, but two newspaper announcements in 1961 of Obama's birth.  Now there was just a FOIA request.  I don't know if the guy was a birther or just wanted to find out one way or another, but  some guy in Arizona, I think he's a radio host, does a FOIA request on the visa documents  when Obama's mother married that Indonesian and they all went to Indonesia for a while. 
[00:44:00]  And there it is.  My son, Barack Obama, born in Hawaii.  We've been waiting a year to get the FOIA request.  We got it.  Once again, it proves he was born in Hawaii.  And by the way, what is the point?  It's not like you have to be born someplace else to be a bad president.  Jimmy Carter, where do they think he was from?  Yeah, I love those guys, too, because you can't tell them anything, either.  Why don't they come up with the birth certificate?  And believe me, I would love, I would have loved for him to have not been born an American 
[00:44:30]  citizen, but he is.  He's an awful president and an American.  One thing I wanted to ask you about, too, because we were talking, I've been complaining,  just as a stand-up, I see what you can do in colleges and what you can't do, where they  think that they're free-thinking, but they're not.  And Carlin, we had Carlin in six months before he died.  George?  Yes.  I forgot his name.  I was like, wait, I know Beard, funny guy.  Oh, she loves you, Ann.  She loves you.  Oh, stop.  We always have fun.  He's smitten.  We love Ann. 
[00:45:00]  But he said that he's...  He's trying to make everyone uncomfortable.  He's like, I'm so sad to say it, but the censorship is coming from the left now.  The college campuses is where it's coming from.  And it's like you've spoken, and in Canada even, they wouldn't let you speak in a college.  And it's amazing how intolerant colleges are when they preach nothing but tolerance, but  they're fucking, they will not tolerate the other opinion.  But Ann just talks hate, hate speech.  And that's why Canadians don't like their hate.  Well, Francois, the provost of the University of Ontario, who sent me the letter threatening 
[00:45:30]  me with criminal prosecution if I gave a speech and engaged in hate speech, is now being,  I filed a complaint against him for engaging in hate speech against me for sending me that  letter, accusing me of hate speech.  And I want, until Francois is in the docks, I will not be satisfied.  By the way, the whole time I was in Canada, it was a week, and I had to go out dressed 
[00:46:00]  as, like, Julia Roberts to avoid the press I was getting.  It was the biggest thing that's hit Canada since, you know, the Calgary stampede.  Francois, I hid under his bed the entire time.  He wouldn't confront you.  Because I just kept going on air saying, this is a human rights violation.  Here's the letter.  Wow.  What is it about, you get a weird response from people.  People, I get really angry at you.  Like, it's an odd, because there's a lot of conservative people, or a lot of people  that have ultra-religious views, or ultra-conservative, or whatever.  It's not the views.  Is it because you're an attractive blonde, like, they don't expect that out of you? 
[00:46:30]  It's a really weird thing people have.  They don't think that a woman who looks like you should take the position you take.  I'll give you my opinion.  I love that theory.  I don't know what it is.  I honestly don't know.  I'll give you an opinion on this whole thing, too.  And I think you're right.  But also, you are very unapologetic.  Maybe that's it, yeah.  Like, people can be angry with somebody.  And then if they sit there and go, well, I meant this, or I really, you took it the wrong  way, and if I offended you, I'm sorry.  Then people go, oh, okay. 
[00:47:00]  Now I could like you.  You are one of the most unapologetic people, and it's refreshing.  It's like, thank God.  Oh, and did you say that?  Yeah, I said it.  And how about this, this, and this?  And what are you going to do about it?  People are just shy.  They can't come back at it.  I got to ask, Ann, were you always like this?  Or did something happen in your life that turned you?  No, I think usually it's a traumatic event that turns you into a liberal.  I had a normal upbringing.  That's why I'm a normal Christian conservative.  But you were able to take care of yourself always, growing up? 
[00:47:30]  I had two older brothers.  One may be showing up here tonight.  He's supposed to, or here tonight.  Oh, shit.  Thank God we didn't say anything stupid.  No, he listens to your show every morning.  He's a morning person, unlike me.  And he loves you guys, and I have gifts for my niece I'm hoping to pass off to him.  But yeah, I had two older brothers who beat up on me, so I think I could attribute it to Jimmy.  I got a younger sister, and I have an older brother, so she dealt with two older brothers. 
[00:48:00]  And same thing, you cannot put anything past her.  Yeah, ask her what she thinks about all of the tales of torture at Guantanamo.  Growing up with me and my brother.  I used to actually give my sister, it was called The Daily.  And it was like, and I just loved torturing her.  It was like, Dawn, it's time for The Daily.  And she'd be like, no!  And I'd come up and take my hand and just whack the top of her head.  And it was every single day. 
[00:48:30]  I'd be sitting there and be like, Dawn, time for your daily.  And she's like, no!  And I'd have to chase her and smack the top of her head.  Why don't you tell Ann about the headstand competition you used to have?  Oh, when Dawn's friends would come over?  Oh, Gary.  You might not like Anthony anymore.  That was when I was a kid.  Everyone was a kid.  Yeah, what did you know?  You were 30, her and her friends were 10.  Oh, shut up!  You're a few years apart.  Why don't you tell that cute story? 
[00:49:00]  I made her friends do a handstand contest because their nightgowns flipped over.  There was a genius in that, though.  There is!  There really is a brilliance to that.  It's mortifying.  I know.  I had to break this love affair off just a little bit, man.  Just a little bit.  All right, come on.  A little twisted, but that's how I ended up in this seat.  Really?  You were mentioning Rick Sanchez during the break.  Are you talking about that?  Yeah, well, I'm very upset I was going to do his show tonight, and they canceled me.  Right.  And why did they cancel you?  I mean, you were telling us it was pretty fucking funny. 
[00:49:30]  Well, you'd have to pull.  It's pretty funny, though.  I would recommend playing it.  Well, no, he likes having me on, and he's one of my favorite liberals to go on with  because he'll come at you, you know, full throttle, but then he doesn't, you know, go off.  He doesn't start crying.  Right?  He says, thank you for a good debate.  So I really like going on his show, and I watch it, and I disagree with him on everything.  But I did get him 1,000 entries on Google the last time I was on that now connect the 
[00:50:00]  name Rick Sanchez with kiddie porn.  You don't want to mess with her.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Well, because he was bringing up the lie about the great civil rights here, and he genuinely  is.  I'm sorry.  He's a liberal.  John Lewis walking in at the health care debate, and all the Tea Partiers there.  And the claim was made, not by John Lewis himself, that the Tea Partiers called him the N-word 15 times.  N-person.  You hear Larry can say that?  N-person.  N-person.  Larry's statement.  I hate to interrupt you during that, but yeah, Larry's statement. 
[00:50:30]  N-person.  He's our favorite of all time.  He didn't know what to say.  So depressed, he's retiring.  He didn't know what to say, and he actually said an N-person instead of an African-American  or black.  So if you break that down, you know what he's really saying.  He's actually using the word to describe all black people.  You know, an N-person.  N-person.  It's brilliant, Larry.  That's what they say.  Larry, who should cut the grass?  I don't know.  Get an N-person.  Very in touch, Larry.  That's very in touch. 
[00:51:00]  You can answer any question you got.  I love it.  You just have that on a button.  You've got to.  We're well-equipped here, Ed.  I want to get that out of my house.  It's a big show.  N-person.  We also got this.  Keep plucking that chicken.  Ernie Anastas.  That was Ernie Anastas.  Oh, you don't remember that?  That was a great one, too.  Oh, my God.  It's one of the greatest news poopers ever.  Ernie Anastas just out of nowhere said.  He meant to say, keep plucking that chicken.  Keep plucking that chicken.  That's the evening news here in New York. 
[00:51:30]  I didn't even realize he said it.  And they're all just like horrified.  But I love when there's a news faux pas, because they're never alone on camera these days.  So the rest of the news crew is like, they make these faces that are so obviously horrific.  Well, the one anchor with her eyes just popping out of her head.  Where's the context?  Yeah, pop that up so we can hear this.  Yeah, because the context is going to make it so much better.  It really is.  And watching everybody's face.  Takes a tough man to make a tender forecast, Nick.  I guess that's why you keep plucking that chicken. 
[00:52:00]  Okay, I'll do that.  Look at her eyes.  Look at her eyes.  What a great face that is.  She's like, did he just say that?  Look at her eyes.  I know it's radio, but you've got to see the clip a million times.  I'm afraid of those eyes.  With Ernie smiling like that, and her look of horror, it looks like a comedy show.  Here's the face she's making.  Picture yourself as a news anchor, and your partner says, keep fucking that chicken.  The face you would make.  That's the face she's making. 
[00:52:30]  Well, Aaron, you did say we should play the clips.  They ran in the Rick Sanchez clip.  Yeah, the start-up is 37 seconds, and then the other clip's a little over a minute.  Is that all right?  Yeah, that's fine, everybody.  So start with this.  And if we can get back to your claim that what you care about is the truth,  why do you keep repeating the despicable lie that John Lewis was called the N-word 15 times on Capitol Hill  at the anti-Obama protest?  That is a lie.  Hold on.  And you have repeated that.  This network repeats it. 
[00:53:00]  All these networks repeat it.  That is a lie.  You know, at least Shirley Sherrod got her reputation back.  Hold on.  Let's be fair.  Let's be fair.  We attribute that to the congressman who made that assertion.  That's called attribution.  It wasn't John Lewis.  Well, there were several there who actually said that.  They said it in a press conference.  But let me come back to the matter of hand there.  I love that.  I love that.  Wait, but you're not getting to the killing.  Oh, no.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll get to that.  You just chill out.  I love that stuff because it's like, he's like, well, it was someone that was there. 
[00:53:30]  He had nothing.  And really fast, Sean and George's.  Sean.  Hey, Ann, would saying that Rick Sanchez will come at you full throttle be exactly the best term to use for him  considering he got drunk and hit someone in his car?  Oh, God.  We don't let him forget that one, Ann.  Oh, geez.  I guess that is.  You should have been nicer to us because we remind people all the time.  That is the ace in the hole in every argument.  Oops.  Full throttle.  I don't know how well his point is.  You just go.  Full throttle. 
[00:54:00]  Nah, right.  All right.  Here's to Rick Sanchez.  Ann goes after Rick here.  So.  No, no, no, no.  There's a hundred thousand dollar reward for anyone who can produce a video of someone calling John Lewis the N-word one time, not to say 15 times.  And you're convinced.  That reward has been out there for three months.  And you're convinced that because no one has taken the money that it didn't happen?  I mean.  There is more evidence that you have a problem with kiddie porn.  I have as much evidence for that as you do, that John Lewis was called the N-word. 
[00:54:30]  And by the way, in fact, I have more evidence because there hasn't been the press searching all over you trying to find your problem with kiddie porn.  And a hundred thousand dollar reward for anyone who can produce evidence of your problem with kiddie porn.  So I have a lot more evidence that you have a problem with kiddie porn than that any tea party or ever called John Lewis the N-word one time.  Forget 15 times.  All right.  You and I are not going to solve that because I wasn't there and neither were you.  And all we've done is attributed what some people have said.  Okay.  I wasn't in your private room when you were going through kiddie porn. 
[00:55:00]  We'll wait for that person to come in and accept the $100,000 reward and see if that's happening.  How long do you wait?  You have made an accusation that a great civil rights era was called the N-word.  You're trying to prove a negative and I want to get back and I want to get back to this point.  All right.  Okay.  You don't have a problem with kiddie porn.  You know, no, I don't want to talk about kiddie porn.  I want to go back to the assertion that you made.  More evidence of that.  Wow.  More evidence.  On CNN.  Wow.  Oh, is that brutal? 
[00:55:30]  And can I say not one denial out of old Ricky boy.  Wait a minute.  What happened there?  Can we go to Google?  I want to see what happens when you put Rick Sanchez in.  Wow.  Because Ann said it's pretty impressive.  Oh, my God.  You put Rick Sanchez in now.  That is owning him.  Yeah.  Does kiddie porn come up?  I don't think I mentioned kiddie porn enough.  No, no.  Kiddie porn, kiddie porn.  But by the way, to his great credit, and this is why I love him, we get to the end of  this totally heated debate and he's totally lovely and he says, thanks for coming on and  I say, thank you for having me. 
[00:56:00]  I love liberals who are smart and have confidence like that.  Who's the toughest guy you've debated?  Who's the hardest guy you've gone back and forth with?  Or woman?  Who's the toughest one?  That's a good question.  There's got to be some of them that are very, very tough.  Well, like I say, most of them won't go against me now, so I end up with the homeless girl.  Who would you like to go against?  Donna Brazile.  Who's that?  Donna Brazile was, she ran Gore's campaign.  Okay.  She was famous briefly, you probably made fun of her for saying we're not going to let the  white boys win this campaign. 
[00:56:30]  You're running a white boy.  He has so little rhythm.  He is so much whiter than George Bush.  Jimmy says all the time.  He's a nerd.  He is an absolute nerd.  He's a nerd.  However, I will say this about Al Gore.  Who knew he and I had so much in common?  Wowee.  I've actually stayed in that hotel, the Hotel Lucia, I think.  I behaved just as naughtily.  Oh, really?  Oh, boy, was she telling the truth.  I know that language. 
[00:57:00]  How you doing?  Ah, my glutes.  I was on a plane all day.  Were you really, Al?  Well, he skated past that, right?  Yeah, it's tough to prove.  It's over that whole thing.  It's one word against the other.  It's very hard to prove.  So who else?  Donna Brazile.  Mickey Kaus.  I don't know who that is.  Kaus Files, really great web.  He just ran against Barbara Boxer in the primary.  Okay.  Very smart, wrote for, you know, New Republic, Newsweek.  Who else?  He's very smart and honest.  Oh, I love Lawrence O'Donnell.  And he's getting a TV show on MSNBC because when he'd fill in for Oberman, he got 40% higher 
[00:57:30]  viewers, which I don't understand because I personally can't miss Oberman.  That's got to be like 30, 40 more viewers.  How about Chomsky?  Chomsky?  No, Chomsky.  Does he do debate?  Is he still alive?  I don't know, actually.  How about Snooki?  Would you debate Snooki?  I think we agree.  Isn't she upset about the tanning tax or something? 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, she's very upset about that.  This is important.  It's not like the whole world's falling apart.  We've got Snooki all over the TV.  As long as Snooki's on TV, we know there'll be another day.  And they're saying she's officially annoying.  Do you know that she's being charged for being a pest?  John McCain said something about her.  That she's...  Too pretty to go to jail.  Too pretty to go to jail.  He was really talking her up like McCain was getting a little smitten with Snooki.  Get in that elephant ass of hers.  Holy shit, that ass is horrendous. 
[00:58:30]  Anne's a big fan, though, Snooki.  Loves her.  Loves the Snook.  Can't stand.  Love the Snookster.  That whole show is a waste.  Do you know competitors send their products, the other competitors' bags to her?  Because it makes the product look bad.  They actually do.  Oh, that's hilarious.  They send each other's products to her.  There's the elephant ass.  That's funny.  Yes.  Anne, check out an elephant ass.  That's not a good...  I don't think that's that bad, actually.  That's rough, Jimmy.  It's not that bad.  That's rough.  I have to stick up for...  That is not a good look.  No, no, no.  That's rough. 
[00:59:00]  Why isn't she wearing underwear?  Because she's Snooki.  She's crazy.  She probably forgot them.  Wild.  She's from Jersey.  She probably used them to carry cheese doodles.  She's really not a...  According to my favorite governor, she's from New York.  Ah.  Favorite governor.  Chris Christie in New Jersey.  Yeah, but you like him?  But what did he just do that really annoyed me?  It wasn't that bad.  I didn't like that politically correct crap.  It was the moth thing.  No, no, no.  Changing the language to make it against the law now in legislation to say the words mentally  retarded or feeble-minded. 
[00:59:30]  And it's a person-first attitude, like a person with disabilities.  I love that this is your issue.  It's always...  For me, language is a big issue.  Language is a big one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's the big one.  It drives me crazy.  No, but this is for legal documents, right?  Semantics.  Probably, but it's such...  We become so obsessed in it, and people get in trouble for it, and that's why it drives  me...  You know, I understand if it's a person...  The second you start legislating language like that, it gets people in trouble for using  it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It kind of makes the word so taboo that before you know what you say it into a microphone,  and now you're in trouble.  Right.  You're losing your job.  Well, I agree with you there. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And one of your...  One of my favorite Coulter quotes was in 07.  This was off the...  Who was it?  Isaiah Washington?  Was he the guy that said faggot?  And you're talking about John Edwards, and...  He went into rehab, Isaiah Washington, which, by the way, everyone knew at the time.  That he was a problem.  And you said, I was going to have a few comments the other day about...  A few comments on the other Democratic presidential candidate, John Edwards, but it turns out  that you have to go to rehab if you use the word faggot.  So I'm kind of in an impasse.  Can't really talk about Edwards, but I think I'll just conclude here and take your questions. 
[01:00:30]  Brutal.  And you know what, though?  That killed.  Yeah.  As much as Tiger has gotten shit and Jesse James has gotten shit, he was the worst of  them all.  He wanted to...  Look what he was doing.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Look at the double-life John Edwards was.  Despicable.  And he went to be president.  Just terrible.  Right.  And, by the way, in trade, you know, in trade, it used to be very accurate for...  Better than polls, because it was people putting their money down on who was going  to win an election.  Oh, right, yeah.  And it's a little less accurate now, because it's so hard to bid.  You have to send in, like, passports and stuff. 
[01:01:00]  But back then, it was incredibly accurate.  And Obama, Hillary, Edwards were all sort of tracking the same faggot joke.  Edwards collapsed.  That's why they were so upset, because everybody looked at him and said, you know, he is kind  of a faggot.  And his response was bullshit.  He didn't come back and go, hey, that really annoyed me.  He came back with some disgusting political response, and I think that bugged people.  He sent his wife around.  Yeah.  Oh, did he really?  Yeah, she emerged from chemo treatment. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, the sick wife tour.  Wow, well, he was banging real hunter.  He really is a despicable...  Although, as a strategist, you have to kind of admire the ruthlessness.  He would have our problems overseas cleared up very quickly.  Anybody that can do that would just fucking carpet bomb the entire country.  So there's a part of me that thinks, boy, that's the man for the job.  Might have been the guy, huh?  He really is a ruthless, nice-haired-having prick.  I think Ann has to go.  I do.  I do.  Yeah.  You're looking at your watch.  Yeah, I know.  I'm so sad.  I want to stay all day. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  This is so much fun.  I know.  I bet your brother didn't make it in.  Yeah, because I'm going to be carrying these gifts around all day.  What'd you get her?  Oh, you don't want to stay because she might hear it.  Oh, good.  No, I don't think she's allowed to listen to Opie and Anthony.  That's adults only.  Come on now.  Dirty, dirty, dirty.  Adults.  No, you were not very dirty today, so I thank you.  Yeah, we try.  Try to keep it a little nice.  There were a few dirty words, but I think you said them all.  This is very weird because there's no commercial.  I think I did it. 
[01:02:30]  There's no commercial break.  We love the awkward walkout.  Now you have to walk out while we're still live on the air.  We usually got a break.  Let's make her walk out awkwardly.  You are a mean guy.  Bye, Ann.  That means we get to check her out again.  No, we'll take a break, man.  We'll be right back.  It's the Opie and Anthony President's Day special.  Sam, in just a little bit, we're going to introduce the audience to Jimmy McMillan.  Who is he and what does he mean to us?  He's running for New York governor or governor of New York, 
[01:03:00]  and he's affiliated with the Rent is Too Damn High party.  What does it all mean?  Find out when we come back.  More highbrow political discourse in moments.  This is the Opie and Anthony President's Day special on the virus.  The Opie and Anthony President's Day special continues on the virus.  Here are your hosts, Sam and E-Rock.  It's President's Day here on the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  I am primetime Sam Roberts.  And I'm E-Rock, and you're in for a special treat as we go through five hours of politically-based material from the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:03:30]  Sam, Jimmy McMillan, he's running for New York state governor.  We get him in studio.  What's happening here?  Yeah, we tried our very best, and we got him.  He was doing I-MIS, so we decided to call his number.  I ran down to the street corner, and boom, there he was waiting.  He decided to not pay attention to the fact that he had other morning TV to do.  He came up to the studio.  He hung out with us. 
[01:04:00]  It was great.  It's Jimmy McMillan, live in studio on the O&A Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony President's Day special.  Outside the studio, we got Jimmy McMillan.  Yeah, where's Jimmy?  Bring on in Jimmy.  Rent is too damn high.  Rent is too damn high.  Look at that.  Nice suit, nice button he's got there with the motto, the running platform.  Thank you, thank you.  Hello, hello.  Thank you.  You met the guy. 
[01:04:30]  You met the man, baby.  Here he is.  You are the man.  You're a big star, sir, and I'm hoping it leads to something for you.  Rent is too damn high.  No, let's say, like I said, say rent is too damn high.  Take a deep breath, say for two damn high.  Yeah, that's how you do that.  Yeah, you got that.  Damn high.  Damn high.  You are the standout of the debate, I got to say, because we saw Cuomo, business as usual.  We see Palladino, that guy, I don't know about him, and then we got Kristen Davis, who's 
[01:05:00]  had her issues and stuff, and you came up there with a legitimate platform.  You believe the rent's too high for your constituency, and you would like to lower the rent?  They are not taking this serious.  They want to play politics as usual, and I'm not.  I'm 64 years old, and I'm watching all these children grow up with nothing, and people can't  raise their families.  People work at eight hours a day and 40 hours a week, a third job.  I've had enough.  I'm here to you.  I got into this race to be a rabbit, and you know, not like I'm making love to somebody, 
[01:05:30]  you know, be a rabbit.  Of course, sir.  To be a rabbit in a marathon.  Set the pace is what I got in this race to do.  You are going to address those issues.  If I ever sit on the stage with you, you're going to address the issues that's causing the  people to suffer, and that's what I went to do.  I hit him so hard with rent is too damn high.  Before Andrew Cuomo knew it, he was saying rent is too damn high, and then I heard him  say, oh, shit, I'm running for government.  Yeah, yeah.  He agreed with you.  It's almost like me having an argument with him and make him get out and, okay, beat yourself  up.  He agreed with you also.  He was like, I agree.  Rent is too damn high.  He don't need to be governor. 
[01:06:00]  And do you notice, by the way, the Post, now they have Jimmy here, rent is too damn low.  They're implying that you shouldn't be complaining about your rent.  Post endorsed Cuomo.  Yeah, of course.  So they're just going to find stories that are not good about you for Cuomo.  Yeah, Jimmy, that's a big story today.  You're saying that your rent is too damn low.  You live in Flatbush in a one-bedroom, $800 a month, and they're saying you should be paying  more for that.  And we just had a whole discussion about it to start the show today.  It sounds like the rent is too damn high for that as well. 
[01:06:30]  Let me tell you what I did.  If you look at my website, as an independent private investigator...  We have a tough time looking at your website, sir.  There's too many colors and blinking things going on.  We're going to have seizures, sir.  They came after me, and I was shot at going away to the doorway of my home.  And I don't want them camping around my house because I have people that live there.  So I gave them information because I don't want them around.  I told them yesterday, this is not accurate.  I just don't want you.  It's about me and the people.  Oh, okay.  I got you.  It's not about me.  It's about the people.  So that's not true.  So you throw them a red herring and say, no, get away from my house. 
[01:07:00]  I'm not the regular politician like the rest of them.  I'm here to fight for the people.  It's about the people's rent, not Jimmy's rent.  So I gave them that.  None of that's true.  You're paying more than $800, sir?  I pay rent.  And if you are five years old, when you become 18, you're not going to be able to pay rent.  Right.  So it's not about me.  It's why I continue to talk about rent.  And what I pay is, as an adult, is not going to help these children live in this city. 
[01:07:30]  But this is why I look at it and say, oh, God, here they go.  The media never let the truth get in front of a good story.  But look at me.  I'm not your average politician.  I am not sitting on, I didn't sit up on that stage to talk about me.  I sit up on that stage to talk about mothers who can't afford to feed their children breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  And even the Post and people who write stuff like this, it still don't get the message. 
[01:08:00]  It's not about Jimmy McMillan.  Yeah, yeah, you're not talking about you.  Let's talk about the little child that got up this morning and haven't had breakfast, and they're going to school to learn.  And we're talking about education for the school, and the children are not making good grades,  when the child hasn't had breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Didn't eat dinner before he went to bed.  This is what it is.  I look at it.  I say, oh, George Bush was about to send them to me to get that story.  But it's a serious crisis.  We are under a rent crisis in the state of New York.  I need y'all to help me out here one minute.  Let's say rent is too damn high.  Ready?  All right.  Rent is too damn high. 
[01:08:30]  That's what I'm about.  It's not about Jimmy McMillan and rent.  It's about the children who graduated from high school, following the attack on the World Trade Center.  We lost 189,000 jobs.  These people are still unemployed.  Most of them are evicted.  They can't find a place to stay.  We've got veterans coming home from the war.  Can't find a place to live.  That's what Jimmy, who Jimmy McMillan is.  Jimmy, I've got a question for you.  We were bringing this up earlier.  You know the renaissance that's been going on in Harlem, right?  They've talked about the renaissance.  Now, this, I believe, is directly due to the fact that they have pushed rents up to push out what they call undesirable people to build Harlem up to where it is. 
[01:09:00]  Now, people are saying Harlem is a much safer place.  A lot more tourism is coming in there.  Now, how do you address the fact that that is a good thing for Harlem when it's such a bad thing for the people?  Well, I got on the people of Harlem many times about what I'm going to say.  They don't practice what they preach.  They talk a big game, but they don't vote.  It's about you getting involved in the voting process, not by going running to church praying for Jesus to be a social worker or something. 
[01:09:30]  It's about you getting up off your ass and getting out there to help your people, help your state, get your community right.  I remember when I used to go to Harlem, I wanted to eat collard greens, macaroni and cheese, and cornbread.  I'm a big man.  I had sasberry stick.  I wanted to have all that.  Those places are gone.  I used to be a musician on stage.  I played in a place on 100, 150 feet of Purple Manor, Smallest Paradise.  I used to go and watch Sammy Davis Jr. do his little tap dance and stuff.  Those places are gone.  And when that's starting to disappear, I started to say to the people, aren't you paying attention?  Something's happening here. 
[01:10:00]  All your socialist life is disappearing.  All your restaurants is going, and you're still walking around talking about black power.  I was very critical about this.  Let's talk about stick together to help make this state a place so you lose everything.  Nobody paid attention to me.  Or they laugh.  Oh, Mr. McMillan, oh, he looked funny with that beard.  You know, he looked like Hulk Hogan.  Oh, we're going to vote for David.  The black Hulk Hogan.  Oh, he's been on the beach for a while.  Oh, we're going to vote for David Dingus.  Oh, we're going to vote for David Dingus.  We support Bloomberg.  Oh, we support, what's his name? 
[01:10:30]  The guy who ran for mayor after the World Trade Center.  Julian.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And nothing's changed.  And they're back into the same mess again.  Now, I appreciate what they're writing about me, about the rent I pay.  But I just want to say it's none of your goddamn business.  It's about the children not having food on the table, a roof over their head, and money in their pocket.  It's about jobs, jobs, jobs.  Well, you're scaring people out there, so they're going to try to knock you down, Jimmy McMillan.  Yes, they are.  They're trying to knock you down.  Do you like that they kind of looked at you like you were a joke ticket, and now you're saying things that really are making them uncomfortable? 
[01:11:00]  Well, my landlord come to me one day and I say, you haven't paid rent.  I say, yeah, so what?  Oh, okay.  You know, and the Marshal Company evicted me long ago.  I've been through my little thing, having struggles as a Vietnam veteran.  I've been in the hospital numerous times.  I'm exposed to Agent Orange with the formed children.  And I say to the people, the politicians are all about them.  I'm different.  I'm all about the children.  Every child is my child.  If you are a parent, and you may not can, you need help. 
[01:11:30]  Well, Jimmy McMillan is here.  I want to make sure your child, I'm tired of your 36-year-old child walking in the door when you and your wife about to get busy.  He should have his own apartment, so I'm going to fight for you.  Rent is too damn high.  And that is what we're fighting for, and I will stay on message.  It is not about Jimmy McMillan.  Our children need a place to stay when they graduate from high school and college and need to be independent and on their own.  Okay, so where is the money coming from so we can lower the rent and still operate these places so they aren't disheveled projects? 
[01:12:00]  Where does the money come from?  People say that I'm a one-issue candidate, and that's just my point.  I have created an economic state of emergency bill that will allow me.  You own a restaurant.  You're paying $12,000 a month for rent, and you live in an apartment.  You're paying $1,800.  I'm going to reduce your rent to $6,000 a month and also reduce your property taxes.  You live in an apartment that was built before 2001.  I'm going to reduce your rent to $650 a month.  But you have to hire some people to work.  And if you hire people to work, I'm going to have at least two, three to six million jobs by two and a half years or less. 
[01:12:30]  And when I reduce your rent to $650 a month, you're going to get that money to go out and buy something.  Right away, problem solved.  Oh, so you're saying it brings some stimulus, as they say, to the community?  You've got some money being poured into the surrounding area?  Simple.  The president don't have to get involved in this.  You need people up top that can think of what we need.  This is the stimulus for the people.  I understand.  I understand.  Now, how about you say you lower the rent? 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  Now, how about the guy that was collecting their rent?  Now, he has less money, and he's not able to maybe hire people.  Or then there's a teeter-totter reaction with your strategy there.  What about the landlords and the people that were collecting the rents?  They have less money.  Now, they're not able to make as many jobs, and they're not able to spend as much money.  Wait.  Okay.  Landlord, collect your rent.  I reduce your rate to $650 a month.  But your landlord got violations against him. 
[01:13:30]  They've been giving him the green light to raise your rent, knowing that it was a violation to do so.  The landlord has been charging him late for paying his rent late.  That's a state violation.  The landlord has not returned his interest from the security deposit.  So the landlord has not complied with the law.  He has not been entitled to the rent increases since the moment after the attack on the World Trade Center,  because this is where it started.  But I have prepared a plan called a net operating loss for the landlord who you paid all this money for for $12,000.  Net operating loss for him.  For the next four years, you'll be able to fill that out and regain your losses.  Under the president, a reinvestment act and recovery act, the money's already there. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, so it's federal money that will pour into the state to compensate for the landlord.  That is it.  Oh, okay.  It's already there.  I got you.  The problem is the people in Albany right now, they are real estate brokers and real estate moguls, elected officials.  They're not going to cut off the hands that feed them.  And my job is to come and tell the Good Old Boys Network, the party's over.  The party's over.  They don't want to cut your rent, because if they cut your rent, they're taking money out of their pocket. 
[01:14:30]  But I'm here to say enough.  And that's why it's a simple process.  They make it look hard, but didn't it sound simple?  That's how simple and easy it is to run this government.  Take all the politics out of this and make it easy for the people to live here.  And it's a stimulus for the people.  We've had mortgage fraud, real estate fraud.  I, as a private investigator, there are real estate Ponzi's going on right now, where they're selling illegal homes.  And homes are going under foreclosure with illegal papers.  And they're still selling these homes.  I pointed this out in 1993.  In 1994, I walked from Brooklyn to Buffalo, New York, complaining about the same thing, and no one listened. 
[01:15:00]  No car?  Oh, they all laugh.  That's what I'd be complaining about.  They all laugh.  They all laugh.  It's hard to listen when you're zooming by.  It's 70 miles an hour.  They all laugh.  When I walked, I slept outside, and I was in the Orondac.  And somebody said, oh, Mr. McMillan, they got black bears up here.  I said, well, it sounded like family to me.  Oh, damn shit.  They said, but I said, are they vegetarian?  I mean, they said, they don't eat meat.  I said, well, you better tell them I'm coming.  I like meat.  But I had my swords with me, my knife with me.  You're ready to battle some bears.  Vietnam, I slept in the jungle. 
[01:15:30]  I was ready to kick some ass.  I let them cross.  I put some urine in a bottle, and I sprinkle my zone.  You cross my line.  Your ass is mine.  I crossed yours, and I knew I had to ask you.  You should have done that at the beach.  All that.  But I ran against the father, Andrew Cuomo, and, I mean, Mario Cuomo in 1994.  Now I'm running against a son, and I don't like, as being a karate expert, we don't talk  about people.  We let the people see what needs to be done and simplify this government and make it simple  for the people to raise their children and raise their family and go on vacation. 
[01:16:00]  That is what living in America and living in this country is all about and living on  this planet.  Take all that other crap and throw it in the car.  I think simplifying politics in general is a very good idea because it's become so convoluted  and confusing to the layman that no one knows what your representatives are doing for you  anymore.  They're not doing your best interest, which they are supposed to be representing you.  So, like, I see some laws that get put in place, and you go, what citizen would have  wanted that?  How does a representative put that in place when the citizens would never ask for that? 
[01:16:30]  Because he has a stake in it.  Exactly.  You think these storages are popping up all over the state for no reason?  Because the elected officials have invested stock.  Mm-hmm.  You don't, their names are hidden under the corporation.  They have made an investment in storage stock, and they're getting filthy rich.  Every time I go to watch somebody put their stuff in storage, I want to really cry, man.  I'm a Vietnam veteran.  I came home, and my brothers' families have no place to stay.  When the veterans come home from the ward, they have no place to stay.  They stay to sleep in the street.  I want to let everybody know something right now. 
[01:17:00]  Jimmy McMillan is turning this country, hopefully, into a rent revolution where we all need a  place to stay.  The information that you read about me and the rent I pay is bullshit.  I told them that because I'm not a politician.  They can what, what, what.  I'm all about the children.  The children who graduate from school need a place and need jobs, jobs, jobs.  Say it, Jimmy.  That's what we're all about.  Economic and jobs, jobs, jobs.  It's not about me.  It's no nonsense.  Don't come to me and ask me a story about my personal life. 
[01:17:30]  I used to be a stripper in a nightclub.  I got it on my Facebook page because I know they will come to me.  If you need, if you, if you're an adult and you need stimulation of somebody, you can't  get it up.  Call me to come and I'll dance to you and your wife.  But when it comes to the children who need breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and this is my  niece.  And she knows that I was used to be a stripper.  You know, the family didn't know.  And I had to, I hid it away from the family.  And my mother said, son, why are you telling me?  I would have loved to come to one of your shows.  Oh, damn.  My mother, my mother's a comedian. 
[01:18:00]  She'll tell you her grandmother is funny as hell.  But the question is that these folks give me love.  They accept me for me being me.  And the question is that, and when I realized that, we all, if you see a child, if you're  in a store and you see a child trying to buy something, which I do in my neighborhood  in Flatbrook, they don't have the money.  So I walk behind them because the mother told them, don't take money from a stranger.  I ball up a dollar and I drop it on the floor.  And I said, excuse me, you drop that?  So this is what you have to do.  You want us all doing that?  We got to start dropping money around?  No, just ball it up and drop it on the floor behind him and say, did you drop that? 
[01:18:30]  But it's not about you.  Yeah.  You may have a heart attack and drop dead.  That little child, it may see you fall and it may come to your aid.  Is that tax deductible, though, that dollar now?  Where?  That crumbled up dollar.  Can I deduct that for my taxes?  My taxes.  But you got to do that.  It'll make you feel good inside.  You see someone getting out of camp, go grab the door.  No, what would make him feel good is to actually pick up the dollar that you dropped for the  kid.  And I would say, yo, man, leave that up for the kid.  And the child would say, he'd steal my dollar.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:19:00]  And I'm going to walk away and the little kid going to beat you up over that dollar.  You know, I said, I did what I could do, you know.  But on a serious note, I am dead serious.  I'm retired from the Postal Service on West 38th Street, Midtown Station.  You did everything, it seems.  You have a lot of life experience, my friend.  Well, I used to be a musician on stage.  I played with the Bronzees Records.  What did you play?  I did, I played the lead guitar.  The songs are here on my website.  I wrote every, I played every instrument.  And I write all my songs.  All the songs that I write is for me to motivate me about talking about issues of rent.  We're getting old.  I remember when I had all black hair. 
[01:19:30]  I remember when I could take my shirt off and I see nothing but egg rolls.  Now when I take my shirt off, I see the crate.  But it's not about us anymore.  As we get older, the body breaks down.  You know, some of us can, somebody asked you this morning, they said, well, how was it this morning when you got up?  Oh, man, I found it hard getting up this morning.  My mother said, oh, son, don't say that.  That sounds nasty.  Hey, either way, that's my work.  I got to say, when we first saw you, we all thought you were just out of your mind.  But, I mean, you're not crazy. 
[01:20:00]  This Jimmy McMillan is not crazy at all.  No, he's passionate about what he believes in.  And he has some knowledge behind him.  I mean, taking the mountain down, that's a little crazy.  There's plenty of mountains up there.  I mean, I don't know how we're supposed to do that.  We're all supposed to get a shovel.  Bulldoze in the mountains to create your own cable network company.  Yeah, we do.  Bulldoze the mountains.  I'm an Army Corps engineer who represents the United States military.  As an engineer, I know we can bulldoze those mountains.  We can put cable companies up there.  We can put telephone companies.  We can put our own oil reserve.  Power plants.  We can put industrial.  Yes.  Why haven't?  And think of the jobs to build all this. 
[01:20:30]  But can't we just keep the mountain and maybe bulldoze Flatbush and put all the cable companies in?  Oh, no.  Well, the way the murder rate, the way the killing is going on in Flatbush, maybe that wouldn't be such a bad idea.  The children, people are working eight hours a day and 40 hours a week, and they wonder, why is there so much killing them?  Why are the kids joining the gang?  Because mother and dad is not home.  They're working three jobs to pay the rent.  Have you ever thought about that?  Have you ever thought about if the rent wasn't so damn high, maybe mothers will be home?  I know some of the fathers I know, the mothers and fathers are broken up because in my neighborhood, it's all about money. 
[01:21:00]  Bitch, you ain't got the money.  I'm out of here.  Because, you know, they're leaving because of money.  It has destroyed family values.  What is wrong with us as a human society?  Are we really paying attention to what's going on?  The gangs, you got whatever the names are in the street, they wouldn't exist if the mothers, I know some mothers can whoop some butts from Jamaica.  I'm in Brooklyn, man.  Yo, man, you know, you come out there like that.  Get your behind in the house, you know.  But I have a gun law.  If some, I apprehend someone in the state of New York that has a gun.  They're using your address.  I'm going to give you enough time to call the attorney, man. 
[01:21:30]  If you don't do that, we're going to come and padlock your house and you're out in the street.  If you have a child, we're going to adopt them and put them in foster care.  They had enough warnings out there.  You've been warned long enough.  Read my lips.  Jimmy McMillan is not playing games.  I'm not a politician.  I'm taking a tough stand on life, restoring family values.  This is what I'm all about.  I am a parent.  And every child is my child.  And your daddy is coming to the rescue.  Jimmy wants to leave a legacy.  I like that.  That's what it is.  I like that a lot. 
[01:22:00]  I've got to ask you about...  Full of piss and vinegar, as they say.  A lot of energy.  I've got to ask you about Reverend Al.  Because it seems like, you know, the black community needs some big, solid black leadership.  And it seems like everyone leans toward Reverend Al.  Or that's what we see because he's on the TV representing black America.  I felt insulted because the media stayed with me for a long time.  It's almost like if I wasn't a black minister, I was nobody.  And I had somebody say to me that one day, why don't you do what Reverend Al do?  And I said to myself, I'm older than Al. 
[01:22:30]  I said, what's his mama name?  You know, which means he could be my son.  So, you know, your father in the footsteps of your daddy.  I mean, whatever he did, I don't talk about him.  I'm not him.  I'm Jimmy McMillan, the most inspiring, intelligent person who went through Vietnam and looking for POWs called John McCain.  And people like him.  The United States Army believed in me, so why can't you believe in me?  I remember the general telling the whole resume of soldiers, if you follow Jimmy McMillan, you're going home. 
[01:23:00]  Jimmy McMillan is here today in 2010, sitting in your radio station and talking.  So I said to all the people, you vote for me, you're going to get you out of this mess.  So the same thing applies.  I may be funny, I may be crazy, but the United States Army depended on me to bring all the soldiers home.  You're a white soldier, you lost your leg.  Who you turned on to get you on that helicopter and get you back?  Jimmy McMillan.  I got three bronze stars from serving the war in Vietnam.  Helicopter flying after we dropped the Marines off and Marines stepped on a landmine.  I jumped my ass out of the helicopter.  I'm not leaving without you, brother.  The helicopter, the lieutenant got mad.  Why are you doing that?  Are you crazy or something?  Yes, I am.  I'm not going to leave him behind. 
[01:23:30]  You bring your ass back down here and get me.  We picked him up, but this is what went on in Vietnam.  I don't care about my life.  I didn't.  If I put that uniform on to save these soldiers in Vietnam who was on a vigorous attack, how could I be concerned about me?  And the same thing applies.  I don't care what they write about me.  I'm not caring about Jimmy McMillan.  Jimmy's selfless.  Jimmy is selfless.  I'm concerned about you.  I want you to be able to get up out of here and go on a vacation.  When's the last time you had a vacation?  When's the last time you took your girlfriend on a vacation?  Damn.  When's the last time you took your children on a vacation?  It's not about Jimmy McMillan.  Probably not for people to ask.  So you can write all the stories you want to write about Jimmy McMillan. 
[01:24:00]  We get seven weeks vacation.  Full disclosure.  I don't think you're talking about us.  Here's what I want you to do on vacation.  I want you to do something you would never do.  I did it, and it freaked me out.  What did you do?  I want you to go to the beach, and I want you to get butt naked.  I want you to walk the street butt naked.  I did that.  I went on the beach, and I took my clothes off.  And here comes this brother came walking past me with a thing dragging in the dirt.  I said, oh, shit, I want to put my pants back on.  And then I walk about.  Everybody's like, you know, everybody's beating themselves. 
[01:24:30]  And I went and stood in the water, and I dragged my hand up, and I tried to hide what I got.  And then I thought.  You got a small wiener?  These people not paying attention at all.  You got to be proud.  Yeah, yeah.  I look wee-wee.  You know, when that water hit it, it was treated.  But when the water, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Shrink it.  Shrink it.  We call it shrink it.  Most importantly, I bring this up for a reason.  Where is your sense of humor?  Mm-hmm.  Can you tell a joke anymore?  No.  Everybody is so uptight that you can't tell a joke, or you'll offend someone.  Those days is over.  Look at me.  Like I told the Viet Cong in Vietnam. 
[01:25:00]  Look at me.  They ran the other way.  I would, too.  He's a very intense-looking guy.  Yeah, yeah.  I wouldn't mess with it.  What was your unit in Vietnam?  I was with the 1st Cavalry, too.  I was with two different units.  With the Engineer Brigade, I was driving the truck to the convoy.  I was driving the truck.  I had a machine gun in this hand, shooting out the door to the Viet Cong, but they were  trying to hit the truck, and I had a .45 in this hand.  I learned how to drive the truck with my legs, because I had to get the supplies to the end  of the road.  I was training.  I'm a marksman with a pistol and a machine gun and a rifle.  And we were getting killed too much. 
[01:25:30]  I was watching the little babies on the side of the road.  They had to cut the baby's leg and put a mine up under the baby, and we soldiers would  go to...  We've ever sympathized, sympathetic to what babies laying on the ground, and as they  were going to pick it up, the Viet Cong would detonate it.  And when I seen the wire, I would get out the truck.  I would park the truck, and I would run to get that Viet Cong.  And they told me again, you must be crazy or something.  They could kill you.  Who's going to kill me looking like this?  And I was really crazy.  You're like Rambo.  You're like the black Rambo.  You heard an American.  Oh, they're saying it right now.  Rambro.  Oh, Rambro.  Very good. 
[01:26:00]  Rambro.  If you hurt any one of my American brothers, you're going to have trouble out of me.  So what are you looking at now?  The American families are hurting.  The President Barack Obama need help.  His constituents don't understand what he's doing.  He need help.  I'm coming to his rescue in a sophisticated way by running for governor of the state of  New York to show them how this is to be done.  And I'm not playing.  Jimmy McMillan took an oath before he joined the United States Army.  They made me raise my right hand.  I'm still under oath.  Take a hold of loyalty to this country.  I'm still that veteran. 
[01:26:30]  And the people need help.  And here I am.  Rent is real.  Y'all help me out.  Rent is too damn high.  God bless Jimmy McMillan.  Wow.  I don't know what else to say.  What type of karate do you practice?  I gave it a name because it was the most deadly form.  Stop your heart from being with just a touch.  Many times in Vietnam, I couldn't find my rifle.  So I had to attack you in the dark.  Just like this, I need to kill you.  So I gave it a name when I came to America.  I took the daily forms out of it.  I called it Shotokan and Nishin Goji Roo. 
[01:27:00]  Because I didn't know how to be treated in one.  I still talk kind of hard and rough today.  People say, why do you talk so loud?  Well, I was in a bomb explosion.  I lost my right ear.  So I lip read you guys and you guys are talking about it.  If I don't understand you, that's why I say hon.  If I don't understand you, I make sure to say hon.  She gets sick and tired of that.  Why are you wearing your hearing aids?  Why are you wearing your hearing aids?  But I turned it into a lovable form called Verbal Judo.  You mad at me?  Maybe.  Why are you mad at me?  Jimmy's very mad at you.  This is Verbal Judo.  This is what I just see.  I thought he was really asking.  I'm like, no.  No, but you can see it in his body language.  This is what I teach.  This is what I teach.  I teach. 
[01:27:30]  There's no reason.  Why are you mad at him?  What are you mad at him for?  Why are you mad at him, Jimmy?  That's somebody here you may not get along with.  You need to just walk by them tomorrow and say good afternoon.  And then when you do that, they're going to say, what are you saying?  You're saying good afternoon all day around this place.  And this is what you want to do.  Don't wake up with a bad attitude.  If you do, you have a problem.  If you're mad at your wife or your girlfriend, you've got a problem.  You need to go somewhere and train your mind.  That's what I did.  I'm a single man.  Nobody want to be with me.  I was making out with this girl one day and I said, rent.  She said, what?  What did you say?  Oh, oh, oh.  Who did rent?  I'm by myself because nobody. 
[01:28:00]  I talk about rent too damn much.  Free your mind, you ass of fire.  Yeah.  But that's the form that I teach.  And I teach you, I do this to let everyone know I'm 64 years of age.  You're not dead yet.  Live this life out.  And you all join me and stick with me.  And let's put this country on the right track.  Right now we have went off to the left and the right.  Everybody's talking about race.  If you say something about Jews, you're anti-Semitic.  If you say something about blacks, you're racial discriminating.  Let me tell you, when I grew up on my way to school, there were black folks hung upside the tree. 
[01:28:30]  I grew up with that when I was coming up as life.  That was 1960-something.  This is 2010.  I have a 31-year-old son and I'm waiting on a grandchild and hope she have a child too.  So I can spoil my death.  These children need you to fight for them having jobs.  Get the hell out of this 60s.  I lived through it.  Don't take me backwards.  We're moving forward from 2010 and beyond.  Moving forward.  That is where my conversation is.  Okay.  When Mr. McMillan, you said something last year.  That was last year.  I love that.  Brilliant. 
[01:29:00]  That was last year.  I fucking love you.  And they're doing that in my face already.  One of the newspapers called me yesterday.  The Daily News.  The Daily News called me.  Well, Mr. McMillan, you know, you said something about the Jews last year.  Give me a break.  This is 2010.  You know?  There's a lot of things I did last year.  I went to the bathroom last year using the cheap toilet paper.  And my fingers went through the middle.  And I had to rip off a corner and wipe my fingernails out.  It's a lot of things.  But now they're using Charming.  They've improved the toilet paper.  And we all improved the time going on.  You know, this is what I'm saying.  Stop and start laughing. 
[01:29:30]  Start having fun.  When's the last time you laid on your back and let your girlfriend tickle you to death?  Try that sometime.  Let her tickle you.  It's funny.  I get a pedicure and a manicure.  That's the most ticklish thing I've ever had in my life.  I'm tickly-toed.  Because when you're a little baby and you're laying in the crib, the black folks do this.  They come to you.  Oh, here's what you do.  They used to grab your wee-wee.  Oh, look at your little wee-wee.  Look at your little cute thing.  But when I got older, I'm saying to myself, she grabbed my wee-wee and said,  she's a little cute thing.  This is what black folks do when you're a little baby.  Oh, they tickle your feet.  Oh, look at your little cute thing.  Little cute thing. 
[01:30:00]  Now, now I'm tickly-toed.  And if a woman grabbed my nest and wanted to lick my balls, I'll land in my ass.  Hey, you said that in front of your knees, sir.  I know.  I know.  It's all about rent.  But the people who are listening, don't even forget your sense of humor.  I think it's all about getting your dick sucks.  Have a sense of humor.  Have a sense of humor.  And let's stick together.  We're fighting for social justice.  And we're going to unite together as a people.  And we're going to bring back laughter.  Where's the comedy club?  Ronnie, Ronnie Dangerfield is gone, but the comedy club is left with him.  We got to bring that back.  Because rent is too damn high.  These places are not here. 
[01:30:30]  Where do we go?  We'll do like I do if I want comedy.  I park my car.  And I just sit in there and I watch.  Somebody's going to come by and try to snatch somebody's bag in a few minutes.  Somebody's going to, there's no bathroom.  Some lady's going to come and stand behind my car and urinate.  Some guy's going to come and stand behind my car and urinate on my car.  Yo, man, don't urinate on my car.  But you got a little wee-wee.  You know what I'm saying?  Don't, have that sense of humor.  You got to have a sense of humor.  And this is what's going to get the state, the country together.  Let's stop talking about each other and let's vote for someone who is going to do the right thing. 
[01:31:00]  Leaders are born and not created.  Right now you're looking at a lot of created leaders.  They want to be leaders.  And I don't talk about Al.  I don't talk about Farrakhan.  I don't talk about Jesse.  All I say about them, I am not them.  I'm Jimmy McMillan.  That means you hate him.  And I'm talking unity for everybody.  I want you to brush your teeth in the morning.  Go to the dentist and get your teeth picked.  I want you to go out with that young lady.  I want you to open her door and close her door.  I'll let her do that to you.  She got muscles and she goes to the gym.  Let her open it and close your door. 
[01:31:30]  I want you to do that.  Get her some flowers.  Don't be afraid.  Don't wait until she die and get sick and take her flowers.  I got in a fight with a guy one time.  I just learned an awesome back spinning back kick.  I seen this guy 6'5 across the street.  I was on 42nd Street.  I told my partner, I said, yo, man, hold on, man.  I said, I got to go and kick his ass.  I want to check out this move.  So I broke his little nose and stuff.  I went to the hospital to get him some flowers.  And his focus, he said, that's the guy right there.  He said, his mother came over.  Get your black ass out of here.  You broke my sound.  No, you crazy or something.  I said, ma'am, I'm sorry. 
[01:32:00]  I just tried to try my back kick.  And I just, he was in the way.  I brought him some flowers.  This is real life.  Don't hate.  Don't hate anybody.  And I hope you guys do well here.  You guys are doing a marvelous job.  Well, we are endorsing you.  Absolutely.  Officially.  This show is officially endorsing Jimmy McMillan.  And send them to my store.  I got my website.  I got t-shirts.  I hear the t-shirts are terrific.  People are talking about the t-shirts.  What's the website?  Let's get out the website address.  Rentistoodamhigh.org.  But when you pronounce it, you say rentistoodamhigh.org. 
[01:32:30]  And go to that store and give us your support.  We need it.  We can do this.  We can do this.  It will happen.  And it's going to happen.  I am Jimmy McMillan.  I'm coming to tell everyone in America, this is a brand new day.  The party is over.  That's great.  How do you feel about prostitution?  I have to ask that in closing.  I have to ask that in closing.  Prostitution.  I used to make love to women while their husbands watch.  Ah, cuckold.  You're that guy.  I have a book on my website. 
[01:33:00]  I have a disease called priapism.  I came back after being exposed to Asian orange.  I have to go to the hospital and I have to inject a needle in my penis to take blood out.  That's my witness right there.  My niece.  So if I have to go to the hospital, she makes sure everything is fine.  Wait, wait, wait.  Slow down.  What?  That sounds like a hell of a thing.  It's called priapism.  I have to go to the hospital.  Your boners don't go down?  No, it won't go down.  Once it's up, it's up.  You know, I'd be like, what the fuck?  Come on, man.  I got things that I got.  What I do is I learn to wear special tight underwear to hold it down so that it won't.  I have just the opposite problem. 
[01:33:30]  But when I was a young stud coming up, I joined us.  There's a special group for men who have an ED problem and you have a wife.  You will come and pick.  There are five guys who said they will pick the guy they want to make up with their wife while they watch.  And once they begin to get up and come up, then you leave.  And that's what I was in that.  I made money doing that because I had a deformed daughter.  No one helped me with my child.  The government said, we don't help you with your children.  You're deformed children.  That's your responsibility.  So I became a stripper and I started working with this organization to get the money to try to help my daughter get the surgery she needs.  So when you become a parent, you have to swallow your pride. 
[01:34:00]  You do what is necessary to make sure you make his meat and pay your bills.  And that's what dad did.  So you don't have a problem with prostitution then?  I was a prostitute.  Okay.  I'm a big fan of it.  That's why I asked.  They need these places for men because every man, we're men.  We're an adult society.  You're telling me because I'm a grown man that I can't get a prostitute.  A couple of years, niece.  You know.  Bless the mic.  Yeah, the moral treats.  This should be a place for me. 
[01:34:30]  Well, who are you because you belong to a religion?  Say it's against your religion for me to do that.  Now we're talking about gay right.  Yeah, it shouldn't have any say.  It's none of your business.  You should be able to marry a shoe, right?  You want to marry a boy just by the water bottle.  We learned from you, Jimmy.  Freedom.  Yeah.  Freedom.  Freedom.  Freedom.  I heard that one of the mayors in this state want to ban smoking.  This made it turn into a police state.  It's what they have done.  And because they don't have, they're not thinking, there are many things that they can do, but they don't have anything else to think about. 
[01:35:00]  These are rich guys who are letting their money work, think for them.  Jimmy McMillan is letting his ability do for the people.  The people is what got me here, and everything that we do is going to be because the people asked us to do it.  And like I say, forever.  One of the programs I went on, they were saying, Mr. McMillan, he was saying rent a thousand times.  Rent is too damn high.  But we're going to bulldoze those mountains for you, upstate New York.  We're going to have our own telephone company.  We're going to build our own industrial plant.  We're going to have our oil reserves.  New York State would be an independent state, independent resources. 
[01:35:30]  You don't have to go to New Jersey and get collard greens.  You don't have to go to Florida to get onions.  You ain't got to go to California and get strawberries.  We can grow all that right here.  Self-sufficient.  Yes.  Yes.  Don't need the other states, right, sir?  You just said a mouthful.  I'm worried that your penis might be too high.  Too damn high.  Too damn high.  It's got to go to the doctor.  Get the needle.  I mean, we're endorsing you, but we don't want the hard-on to get in the way, sir.  Well, the women think different.  You don't worry about it being too high.  The women worry about being too short.  He is good. 
[01:36:00]  He is good.  You know, I like having a sister humor and getting involved in it.  I never forget one time I was making love, and she said, more and more.  I said, that's all I got?  Where am I going to get that?  We as adults have the right to speak our freedom, freedom of speech.  If you don't like what I'm saying, and Howard Stern is my dog, I love the way what they did  to try to censor him for what he was saying. 
[01:36:30]  Freedom of speech.  This is America.  Who in the hell are you to tell me what I can't say?  If it offends somebody, that's called life.  People will be offended by things you say, but they shouldn't then make laws to keep you  from saying that.  Yes, they do.  And New York is about to change forever.  Because when I'm inaugurated, I might get inaugurated.  Oh, inaugurated, right.  Inaugurated.  I'm a country by a fat tongue.  I might have my G on.  Yes, I got you. 
[01:37:00]  I might have a G string on.  To let the people know that I'm sick of the bull.  Our children need someone.  I will tell the children, get away from the TV.  I might moon you.  You know, they're getting on people now.  They find some guy in the school for mooning.  I might moon you.  So children, stay away from the TV when I get inaugurated because your parents are catching  hell trying to feed you.  I put a lock on my refrigerator when all the kids were there.  I was trained to come to my house because they wasn't eating at home.  And then the lock was a joke.  Because if you didn't do your push-ups and stuff and do your sit-ups and if you tried 
[01:37:30]  to act like you was bad in school, if you came in with good grades, I didn't train you.  When you come into my class, you did 5, 10, 50, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40.  You did your five-time tables all the way to a 200-time table.  This is how you teach.  You learn.  Education in schools is what we're here.  But mainly we're here to restore a calm so people can live their families and raise  your children without me telling you how to raise your child.  But I want to give you the resources to raise your child.  If you're a landlord, don't worry.  I want you to hire some people, and I want you to pay low rent.  I want you to get married. 
[01:38:00]  Are you married yet?  No, sir.  I want you to get married.  You've got no reason to be single.  I'm going to get tired of your masturbation.  This is what I want.  I want you all to be happy.  And so I hope everybody agrees with me.  And thank you for endorsing the Rent Too Damn High campaign.  Absolutely.  Get out there and vote.  Thank you.  Jimmy McMillan.  Our guy.  For the president of the United States.  Screw this governor thing.  Oh, man.  Right to the top of that.  Yeah, right to the top.  All right.  You've got to say it one more time as we go to break.  As we go to break.  We do this together. 
[01:38:30]  Uh-huh.  We say rent is too.  Damn.  Okay.  Ready?  Rent is too.  Then we breathe in.  How do you do?  Rent is too.  Damn.  High.  Thank you so much, gentlemen.  Hey, this is Jimmy McMillan on the Oprah and Anthony Show.  And also, we want you to get a chance.  Don't forget to listen to the Oprah and Anthony Show.  We want you to do that because I'm here.  I wouldn't come here if it was a bunch of nonsense.  Once again, this is Jimmy McMillan asking everyone to listen to the Oprah and Anthony Show.  And don't forget to vote.  But most importantly, don't forget to listen to Oprah and Anthony. 
[01:39:00]  Oprah and Anthony.  Wake up with Oprah and Anthony.  When you go to bed, when you go to the bathroom, wipe your butts at Oprah and Anthony.  And let your girlfriend say, what?  Who you talking about?  Oprah and Anthony.  And after you finish saying that, say, rent is too damn high.  Thank you, folks.  It's the Oprah and Anthony President's Day special.  Sam, in a bit, we're going to wrap up with Alex Jones.  This will be part three of the long-winded saga.  He's got some stuff about the moon, the Gulf oil spill, and Jimmy is still going round  for round with him and painting this guy into a corner. 
[01:39:30]  Who can stop Alex Jones?  Jim Norton.  Can he?  He almost did.  Well, now that we know the answer, no reason to stay tuned.  Nope.  We'll be back next.  More of O.P. and Anthony's President's Day special coming up on the virus.  The virus.  It's the O.P. and Anthony President's Day special.  Here are your hosts, Sam and E-Rock.  It's the worst of O.P. and Anthony President's Day edition.  My name is E-Rock.  This is primetime Sam Roberts.  Sam, how excited are you?  I'm beyond excited. 
[01:40:00]  We're going over some of the best political guests that we've had on the show in honor  of President's Day.  E-Rock, let's get to another one.  Sam, in this segment, via ISDN from Austin, Texas, we're going to have radio show host  and a well-known conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones.  He's on the program, and the guy is, uh, he thinks he's factual, but he could be nuts.  You just don't know.  What's a theorist?  It's me not pronouncing the word correctly.  What word?  Theorists.  You did it again.  Alex Jones, he's made quite a name for himself in the conspiracy theory realm. 
[01:40:30]  He's on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  He's trying to prove to the guys that his theories are indeed fact.  He talks about the World Bank economic conspiracies, the CIA bringing drugs in in the 80s, which  I think did happen, and a whole lot more global domination by a one-world government.  Ah!  And that one-world government is Google, by the way.  Oh, I thought it was NWO.  No, Eric, it's not always about wrestling.  The real NWO.  Alex Jones on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's the O.P. and Anthony, President's Day Special. 
[01:41:00]  Yes.  Who's Alex Jones, Anthony?  You know anything about this guy?  Well, if I could grab this.  Alex Jones has an XM show.  The Alex Jones Show?  Yes, on 165 Talk Radio.  And it's the Alex Jones Show, yes.  And what he does is, as I read this, is...  Big conspiracy guy.  Yeah.  Rogan likes him a lot. 
[01:41:30]  A lot of comedians like him.  I don't know if he's a good guy or if he's a dick, but I know he supposedly does good radio,  and he's a big conspiracy guy.  Well, is Joe Rogan around today?  Did we try to get him?  He's West Coast now.  He's West Coast.  And we'll just see what he...  My issue is, I just want to actually see what he thinks about certain things.  Yeah, he's got a lot to say about all kinds of these things.  Things that are going on that people have these misconceptions about and conspiracies. 
[01:42:00]  He has a film called The Obama Deception.  It's a hard-hitting film that completely destroys the myth that Obama's working for the best interests of Americans.  The Obama phenomenon is a hoax carefully crafted by the captains of the New World Order.  He's one of those guys.  He believes in the New World Order.  The Illuminati!  He's going to be on at about 10 minutes.  He's being pushed as savior in an attempt to con the Americans into accepting global slavery.  We've reached a critical juncture in New World Order's plans.  It's not about left or right.  It's about one world government. 
[01:42:30]  The international banks plan to loot the people of the U.S. and turn them into slaves in a global planet.  I'm sure he's a smart guy, and I'm sure his arguments make sense.  I just can never buy that stuff.  Yeah, it's...  Of course, he believes 9-11's an inside job.  I don't give...  There's a New World conspiracy in which the world leaders are looking to create one world government with ultimate power.  I don't give people that much credit.  Not at all.  If that ever happened, it would be because that's what we just turned into.  You know?  That whole one world power thing. 
[01:43:00]  See, conspiracy guys...  Well, I'll say this to him, too.  Believing in a conspiracy because you think it has merit makes sense to me, but even if I don't agree with it, it makes sense.  But when you believe in a conspiracy, it's almost like when you're a conspiracy guy, your agenda is the conspiracy must be proven.  So it's like you will kind of ignore facts that point against it.  Or twist them around to make them fit your agenda.  Or you'll take teeny-weeny innuendos that seem like facts that strengthen your cause, and you'll hold them over overwhelming facts in the other direction. 
[01:43:30]  That's been used by the 9-11 people, conspiracy guys, so much.  They totally discount facts.  They take these little fucking tidbits of rumor and speculation and present them as fact.  And then before you know it, people are watching these movies on the Internet and stuff and going, wow, that's amazing. 
[01:44:00]  It's like, no, it's made up.  It's fake.  That's my problem.  It's not what they're saying.  It's their lack of common sense in a lot of cases and the way they refuse to bend when it's something that goes against them.  They accuse everybody else of having an agenda.  Gatekeeper.  But their agenda is that there is a conspiracy happening and nothing is going to tell them.  No matter what.  I don't know if this guy's like that.  I don't know.  I can't say he's like that.  I don't know.  Well, we've got a guy that listens to his show religiously. 
[01:44:30]  Okay.  Rocco in New Hampshire.  Rocco.  Dude!  Dude, it's thermite, man.  It's thermite.  What do you know on Alex Jones?  Do you listen all the time?  Actually, Alex Jones has been around for a while.  He's been around for probably about 15 years.  He's a really, really good researcher.  Scares the living shit out of me, though.  And a lot of times you listen to him and he's got a four-hour show or something like that.  And I only catch him on my iPod.  He's got a podcast that he plays out, too.  But in his shows, he talks about a lot of different conspiracy theories, but he backs 
[01:45:00]  them up with a lot of, I'll call it interesting factoids because really any theory just has  to be proven no matter which way you twist and turn it.  Jimmy, you know that more than anything, right?  Yeah, sure.  I mean, even a theory like the theory of relativity, it's never been proven if you think about it,  but yet we live day in, day out, you know?  So these theories have a lot of backing to them, and they're very interesting in a lot of  It's a theory, yeah.  Well, Danny just said, Danny just said, Danny sometimes makes really good points into the 
[01:45:30]  keyboard.  He said that's why it's a theory.  It's a theory of relativity, not the fact of relativity.  He's right.  The law of relativity.  Yeah, yeah, and you know, and you can go on and on and on, and this argument is never  going to be proven in any way, shape, and form in our lifetime.  But the fact of the matter is that if you listen to him and just really think about what he's  talking about, it is really interesting.  And you know, Jim, and Ant, I've been listening to you guys for years, too, you know, but you've  got great theories, and you've got really great intelligence, too. 
[01:46:00]  Jimmy, you know, you're great as well.  Thank you.  You know, you're a dick, but I love you.  Wow.  Well, that's wonderful.  That's what I want on my fucking tombstone.  Go fuck yourself.  How's that, Rocco?  You want go fuck yourself on your tombstone?  Yeah, exactly.  That's what I'm going to have on mine.  But no, seriously, you guys all have great views, and this guy's really good, too.  Don't attack him.  Just listen to him.  He's really got...  I'm not going to attack him unless he attacks us.  I don't have a lot to disprove his theories.  Like, oh, we don't.  It was more like I hear he's an interesting guy, and if he's got a radio show that does conspiracies, 
[01:46:30]  to me, that's interesting.  So it's not about attacking him or proving him wrong.  No, it's not about that.  I think he's probably an interesting dude.  Yeah, and I'm not a conspiracy theorist.  I listen to all views.  I mean, you know, whether 9-11 was an inside job or not, it's fine.  You know, whatever's going to happen is going to happen.  It'll come out eventually.  But at the same time, you know, you think about all the little things, like, you know,  a hole in the Pentagon, five feet wide or five meters wide, whatever it is.  There's a lot of interesting stuff there.  Five meters wide.  You mean that hole that the firemen made when they broke through the wall as opposed to 
[01:47:00]  the other hole that the actual plane made when it hit on an angle?  So that's why it wasn't the shape of the plane like it was in the World Trade Center, and  it was concrete and brickwork instead of steel.  And there's absolutely evidence of engine parts and fuselage parts and plane parts.  It's all over the place.  Yeah, I know.  It's like, it's, it's, that's what bothers me about conspiracy guys is, like, they never  acknowledge facts that disprove what they're saying, regardless of how strong the facts 
[01:47:30]  are.  And to me, it's...  Hey, guys, how you doing?  Oh, okay.  Alex.  How'd that happen?  Alex?  Are we just connected to Alex?  Oh, are we live on air right now?  Yeah, dude.  Nobody even told us you were coming in.  Well, we don't...  Oh, okay.  I mean, they just pointed me in here and said they're going to be ready for you in a minute,  and I walked in here and sat down.  Oh, cool.  Good thing I didn't say anything embarrassing.  That's fine.  I mean, if you need a couple minutes, no problem.  No, no.  It's good to be here on the show.  I've heard it many times, and I hear people talking about it all the time, so I know it's  very, very influential, so it's good to be here with you. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, we were just hashing over some of the, you know, biggest conspiracies that are going  on these days and over the past few years.  There's, of course, 9-11 and the whole New World Order thing.  So where do you stand on a lot of these?  Are you one of these just, it's an absolute conspiracy, a little more open-minded with  these things?  Where do you stand?  Well, really, I'm somebody who goes off the facts, off of what I can prove.  Now, people can have disagreements about the way I interpret things, but 15 years ago when 
[01:48:30]  I first got on radio, I talked about the Gulf of Tonkin being staged to get us into Vietnam  in 1964, and I had the San Diego newspaper clippings from the time, from research I'd done and  from books I'd read, but it was only a rumor for the general public, so it was a conspiracy  theory.  And, of course, five years ago it was declassified that the Gulf of Tonkin was staged, and they  released the LBJ tapes with McNamara where they planned to stage it. 
[01:49:00]  And McNamara tells the president, showing who the boss was, how they were going to stage  it and what he would say coming up in two days at the press conference.  And it's LBJ at his ranch outside Austin, where I sit, and McNamara, the defense secretary  at the Pentagon.  And another example is, more than 10 years ago, I had declassified, hidden in plain view,  government documents about terraforming or geoengineering of the globe going on.  Since the mid-90s, there's been a giant covert, hidden in plain view, weather modification 
[01:49:30]  going on on a global scale, and it's run by the Pentagon.  And now, two years ago, at the end of the Bush administration, they began to declassify  more of it, and then John P. Holdren, the White House science czar, went public in his  first press conference and announced that they basically can manipulate and control the  weather.  It's a secret program, but he's just letting us know what's going on.  They're saving us from global warming.  So my point is, one man's conspiracy theory is somebody else's facts.  Now, are there people saying they're blood-drinking lizards from Planet Pop-Tart that are psychically 
[01:50:00]  controlling our brains?  Are there schizophrenics running around who think that they're Jesus and the Pope and  Mary and Joan of Arc and a Keebler elf rolled into one, and also the Lucky Charms person?  Yes, but I'm somebody who just covers the facts.  I can prove, and I found nine times out of ten, truth is much stranger than fiction.  And Alex, let me just see where they can hear Alex, too.  He's on XM 165 talk radio Saturdays. 
[01:50:30]  No, he's not on Sirius, only on XM 6 to 9 p.m. Eastern.  You're not from the school of thought that sometimes the path of least resistance is, in  fact, the facts?  Well, the social engineers are able to predictively, especially with computers, but before they  had Idiot Savant and others that were able to societally manipulate things.  They call it the scientific dictatorship, the final revolution.  This is what all the top globalists, even 60, 70, 80, 90 years ago, Bertrand Russell, 
[01:51:00]  H.G.  Wells, and countless others who wrote fiction and nonfiction, who were members of the British  Royal Society.  They talked about understanding normal weakness, normal human behavior, and then guiding things  and manipulating things through our normal instincts.  And so, yes, most of what goes on is just human weakness and human greed and lust and  avarice.  But the New World Order, like a symphony conductor, knows how to play all those different factors  together in a type of three-level chess where they're looking forward long term, and they're 
[01:51:30]  also willing to make sacrifices.  The only thing that I find troubling about any conspiracy is the fact that I've never  seen a group of people able to work together to be quiet enough for long enough where it  doesn't come out and get exposed in some way, shape, or form.  Well, I totally agree with you.  I absolutely, totally agree with you. 
[01:52:00]  That's why people got off the ships in San Diego after the Gulf of Tonkin when they rotated  back a year later, and the captain of one of the ships and some of the top officers said  it was totally staged.  No torpedoes were fired at us.  And so the truth did come out, just like I've interviewed police officers and firefighters  and medical workers that said they heard the countdown to blow up Building 7.  And now even a Fox News reporter admitted, okay, well, there was going to be a countdown  to blow it up.  But since it fell on its own, we didn't have to blow up Building 7 on 9-11. 
[01:52:30]  So I agree with you.  This stuff all comes out.  See, I don't agree with that whole thing as far as Building 7 goes and the World Trade  Center being rigged for explosives because it just doesn't make sense that something on  that grand of a scale, when you know the facts about building demolition, you could not possibly  plant that much explosives within a building that is operating.  I don't care if there was some people taking some days off and some floors were closed and 
[01:53:00]  there were maintenance crews.  When you watch a building being demolished, it takes weeks, if not months, of prep work  by professional...  And now all you need is some jet fuel.  And even though the firefighters reported that most of the fires were out and people were  standing in gaping holes in the North and South Tower, waving white shirts, calling for  help, suddenly those giant four-foot-around columns shattered and were projected 600 feet  into other buildings.  And they didn't find any body parts bigger than about an inch because the explosives were so 
[01:53:30]  high-powered.  Tower 1 and 2 were non-conventional, massive explosives, top-down.  Building 7 was a classic controlled demolition.  And, of course, the CIA was based in the building.  See, I cannot, absolutely cannot accept that.  I accept the fact that it was extremists that hate our way of life, hate our country.  Hate our freedom.  Hate our freedom, of course.  And flew planes into buildings, and the buildings were not set up to take that kind of heat, 
[01:54:00]  not melting till the point of liquid, but enough to weaken the structure so that when  it did collapse, when you have that much weight falling onto itself, you're going to get pieces  of metal flying out as if there was an explosion.  Because, literally, it is the power of an explosion.  You're getting that much energy is being dispersed out of the building.  Well, did you know that NIST had given all those reasons, the pancake, and they said  Tower 1 and 2 were hollow, which wasn't true. 
[01:54:30]  And now they've had to reverse all that.  And on Building 7, they've given six different reasons and had to reverse it.  I mean, if you look at Building 7, you know, we interviewed the head, the Deputy Head of  Emergency Management, Mr. Jennings, in New York, Barry Jennings.  And then about a week later, he mysteriously died after we aired the interview with him.  And he talked about how they blew up Building 7.  And, of course, then he died mysteriously.  How, then, was this explosive brought into these buildings? 
[01:55:00]  Well, I mean, let's talk about 7.  It had the FBI, NSA, CIA, Defense Intelligence.  It was the biggest single U.S. intelligence building, private intelligence building in the  world.  Most buildings of that size, 47 stories or more, are completely government installations like  Fort Meade with the NSA and others.  The entire building was a giant spook command base.  Yeah. 
[01:55:30]  You like that little ding-ding there?  I absolutely do.  Is that the Pavlovian conditioning?  Hey, guys, but I also want to tell you, I am on XM.  They are one hour of my syndicated radio show also at night.  But I really appreciate you guys out of the gates plugging that.  Sure.  Also, the websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.  And that's where people can actually go and look at the information that we actually cover.  I mean, I was talking 10 years ago when they got rid of Glass-Steagall, actually 11 years  ago, with economists about how the IMF and World Bank had gotten rid of Glass-Steagall-type 
[01:56:00]  legislation in third world nations by design.  Gone in and paid off governments to do it.  So the private banks could come in and sell derivatives to the countries to financially destroy them.  And now we have the Goldman Sachs Timberwolf emails.  We have the McClatchy newspaper emails that they got where Goldman Sachs premeditatedly  sold derivatives to destroy their competition and to collapse the economy so they can consolidate  power.  And now the new banking re-regulation legislation, even the Washington Post admits, allows the 
[01:56:30]  private Federal Reserve to fully take over any banks or institutions they wish and gobble  up their competition.  That's why the Texas Banking Association president two months ago wrote an editorial saying this  is a criminal takeover by the very central banks that engineered the financial collapse.  But we hear on the news, oh, Obama's getting tough on those rascally bankers.  He's going to show them by giving them even more power.  It'd be like if somebody robbed a bank and the police showed up and said, wait a minute, 
[01:57:00]  you just stole a million dollars.  We're going to give you a truckload of gold bars to punish you and 15 hookers.  How does that sound?  Can I ask Alex a question?  This is off the subject.  It's something I wanted to ask in the beginning.  Then we got into 9-11.  What made you a conspiracy guy?  Because to me, my issue with conspiracies is that it seems like a lot of times people  become so invested in the idea that a conspiracy must exist that their agenda becomes proving  a conspiracy as opposed to seeing sometimes plain and simple facts in the other direction. 
[01:57:30]  You seem to be a very well-informed guy.  What put you on the road to thinking that there's a lot of conspiracies?  And I believe that some of them you're probably very right about.  Well, that's a really good question.  I mean, number one, you know, I played football and drank beer and everything else in high  school, but I also, because my mom's got a degree in history, I happened to see a lot  of history books laying around from the time I was about 11, and I started reading history  books voraciously instead of fiction.  And I read Gibbons, Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire, Rise and Decline of the Roman Empire, 
[01:58:00]  Shearers, Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, Heinz Hobel's Order of the Death's Head.  I read the Secret Wartime Report that had been declassified around that time,  The Mind of Adolf Hitler.  I read about the Japanese imperial system.  I studied the Aztec Kingdom and all of the subterfuge and conspiracies and the ruling classes  and how they engineered societies even thousands of years ago.  And then in my high school, I never really did drugs.  You know, I smoked pot here and there, but I'd been to parties where people were using 
[01:58:30]  drugs.  And I also hung out when I was in high school, you know, with college kids.  And so I would see the police, who I'd see do drug raids at my school, I would then drive  across the lake from Rockwall to Rolette, and I'd see the same cop at a college party  selling cocaine.  And so then I found out that the sheriff was dealing cocaine, that the police were involved,  and later they did go to prison for it.  But so I saw them doing drug raids at the school and busting kids for, you know, half a  joint or a roach, and then I saw them parading around the news as our saviors, but I knew 
[01:59:00]  full well by the time I, you know, left, you know, Dallas and moved to Austin, that  the police, and then later I found out, I knew some, I had some friends who had older  brothers who were drug dealers in Dallas, and they said, of course, you know, we get  our marijuana and other drugs from the Dallas Police Department out of the drug lockup.  And then I would see the news saying, it's ridiculous, police don't deal drugs.  And then later I read about Serpico and other cases, and I interviewed famous New York detectives 
[01:59:30]  where in the 60s and then again in the 70s, they had to fire over 75% of the vice squad  in New York because they were dealing drugs and running awards.  But then the news told me the police don't deal drugs.  Then in 96, I watched the congressional hearings where the CIA solicitor inspector general admitted  that the CIA shipped in the majority of the cocaine during the 80s and gave the crack  cocaine recipe to people, and then later interviewed Freericke Ross and others.  And I mean, look, now on Fox News, I have video, you can just Google Fox News admits 
[02:00:00]  Pentagon growing opium.  And it's so in our face now, they have a Roldo go, I'm going to talk to this colonel  in the Marine Corps.  Colonel, so you're guarding the opium.  Yes, we don't like it, but we actually help them grow it now.  And if we don't grow it and ship it out, then Al Qaeda will get the opium money.  So, okay, whatever, you decriminalize it, then Al Qaeda, Al CIA, that we admittedly created  in the 80s, they won't be making money off of it because it won't be illegal anymore. 
[02:00:30]  I mean, now Reuters, AP, New York Times all admit our government grows the frickin' smack  and ships it in.  I'm tired of it.  I'm tired of it.  They're drug dealers.  They've got the drugs illegal so they can get higher prices shipping it in.  Can I say, if you didn't say Al CIA, how did you say it?  Al CIA-da.  If you didn't say we created in the 80s, I just never would have gotten the fact you  were saying CIA, but that made me go back and think it.  Al CIA-da. 
[02:01:00]  I've got to ask you, what is the endgame here?  Because it seems like all of these are somehow tied in to this giant power grab.  Who is the head of this?  Where is it going?  Why haven't we gotten to the point where this entity, this thing that is doing all  this, has ultimate control?  Where is the endgame in this whole big, big picture?  Social Darwinism.  The final revolution.  I have literally over 100 government finance textbooks like Ecoscience by John P. Holdren, 
[02:01:30]  the current White House science czar, where they say a planetary dictatorship.  The Financial Times of London had an article titled just last year, and now for world government.  And they admit, we're smarter than you.  We kept it secret for your own good.  It is a kind, gentle authoritarianism, an oppressive system for your own good.  We are going to create a global government control grid that controls all the resources,  all the money.  We are then going to create a carbon footprint, because humans exhale carbon dioxide. 
[02:02:00]  And we are going to tax that, and we're going to have a one-world government that enforces  a one-world, one-child policy.  And we are going to phase out at least 80% of the world population as State Department  memorandum, declassified 1992, written 1973.  State Department memorandum 200, and it's double-coded, also as a CIA document.  State Department memorandum 200 states that they will use war, famine, and sterilization programs 
[02:02:30]  at that time to reach the goals that if third-world countries want U.S. loans, half of their  population must be reduced.  Alex, hold on.  I'm not to interrupt you.  I'm sorry.  Just a question on the theory of it, because I'm – why –  Not a theory.  Okay.  Your feelings on it.  If this –  The whole stated fact.  I have all their – they think we're so dumb.  This is admitted.  Hold on.  Not in plain view.  If this is what's happening, or if there's a world order, why would those who are in charge  of it allow information to be passed so easily? 
[02:03:00]  Like, when you look at what you could have done in 1975, Abu Ghraib was not even able  to be kept a secret.  There are really – secrets are so easily exposed now.  Why allow the system to progressively get more and more transparent, not by their doing,  but simply by the way information is passed?  No, they've actually done – that's a very astute point you made.  There are psychological warfare studies from the 50s, the first ones I read by British 
[02:03:30]  intelligence that were declassified, and then you can read more modern versions in  psychological treatises out there about learned helplessness, acclimation, to where now they  just basically don't even care if I'm on the air throwing all this out.  They know the average person is just going to think it's a conspiracy theory and not actually  go read these government textbooks.  Here's an example.  In Montebello two years ago, it was in the Toronto Star that the police attacked their 
[02:04:00]  own police as a pretext to then attack the peaceful protesters to create a pretext in the  future to just shut down protests altogether.  Police admitted that the Pentagon sent in troops dressed as anarchists in 99 to attack police  as a pretext as a pretext to then demonize them on the news, agent provocateurs.  And now at the G20 in Pittsburgh and at the G20 in Toronto that was going on this week and last 
[02:04:30]  week, they actually have black vans pulling up.  We have video of this up on Infowars.com.  Black vans pulling up and grabbing protesters, peaceful protesters for no reason, men, women, you name it, children in some cases, and dragging them into black vans and driving away with them.  And I discovered, going back to G20 meetings three, four years ago in different parts of the world, that it was staged.  They were grabbing actors who were role players to scare everyone, and they would do it in front of news cameras to say, 
[02:05:00]  you may not just get arrested if you protest, you may disappear with plainclothes men grabbing you and putting you in vans.  And then the news says, oh my God, look, the government's kidnapping people, and then now this year they're actually doing it for real.  So just like Jack Bauer tortures somebody's kid on 24 in front of their parents to get answers, and it turns out he's the good guy,  they're reshaping us through Pavlovian conditioning, social conditioning, to accept that secret arrest, kidnapping, Abu Ghraib is good. 
[02:05:30]  They're releasing this on purpose.  Bush came out two weeks ago and said, yeah, I ordered torture, and I'd do it again.  Meanwhile, the people he ordered to do it went to prison.  But it's all part of a conditioning process.  But my thing is, why allow the real information out?  Like something like the Freedom of Information Act.  That's such an, if the world dominance or world order is the issue, why would you allow something like the Freedom of Information Act?  He'd probably argue that there's certain information they would want to get out. 
[02:06:00]  Absolutely.  Let me break that down.  Very good point there as well.  Why do we have the National Security Act?  Why do we have the Foyer Act?  1947, almost everything the U.S. government does is out in the open.  The British OSS founds the CIA out of blue bloods at Yale, skull and bones.  That's mainline news and covered in the film The Good Shepherd that Robert De Niro made with Matt Damon.  But if you watch that, I mean, what do you have? 
[02:06:30]  You have satanic rituals going on with the guys that founded the CIA.  Well, that's actually true.  Who is Skull and Bones?  And I'm going to answer your question this way.  Skull and Bones, in 1832, this is Encyclopedia Britannica.  In 1832, British intelligence came in and made deals with some of the wealthiest people in the U.S.  We'd just beaten the British, you know, 40 years before or so.  And they came in, and this has now been released as part of their annals, and said, we're going to take over Yale and Harvard and Princeton, and we're going to kind of merge the U.S. again back into the British Empire, but you'll share in the empire. 
[02:07:00]  And they made deals with the robber barons, and they said, we're going to finance you with Rothschild money, and we're going to finance the Rockefellers and others.  This is when all this got started, and we're going to set up British intel through your – I mean, that's all a secret society was in that day and age, was a private intelligence agency.  And they did it through elite colleges, because that's where the elite families are. 
[02:07:30]  And so that's how we got the CIA after World War II out of British intelligence, OSS, and Skull and Bones founded the CIA.  And Americans, and the Congress said, you want unlimited power to rob banks, do whatever you have to worldwide to fund your operations.  You want all this incredible power.  Smedley Butler had just come out, the former Marine Corps, two-time congressional medalist.  Was that really his name?  Smedley Butler.  That sounds like a name somebody makes up to make up an awful name. 
[02:08:00]  That's a terrible name.  From a cartoon, yeah.  I got to start.  But, well, no, I mean, Smedley Butler, he's the most highly decorated Marine in U.S. history.  But Smedley Butler came out and said, look, there is basically a foreign intelligence operation taken over the U.S.  They tried to hire me to overthrow the United States.  And they said, we don't care, Smedley.  We're setting it up.  And they tried to hire him to be part of this.  They wanted to just have a complete coup.  But Smedley blew the whistle, so they just said, look, we'll just have a national security state. 
[02:08:30]  And so Congress said, okay, but you've got to have a four-year request where 20 years later things have to be released.  And you notice now it's 40-plus years after Kennedy, and now they've backed it up to permanent.  First thing Obama did when he got in is he just said, forget it.  It's supposed to be declassified.  It's unlimited classification now.  And so they do, and more and more they're denying four-year requests.  I put in three or four times in the last five years for my FBI file, my NSA file, by federal law I'm supposed to get it, and they don't even respond. 
[02:09:00]  So I had a lawyer send letters, and they said, look, it's national security.  We're not telling you what we got on Jones.  On you.  What?  National security.  Yeah, they will not give me my files.  See, the Kennedy assassination is one, too.  Like, I was very, very big on the conspiracy.  I believed it very thoroughly.  I went to Dealey Plaza.  You know, I read a lot of the books on it, and then the more I would hear little things that would kind of go against conspiracies, which sounded like, ugh.  And then I did a little bit more research, and I actually found a lot of the stuff that the conspiracy guys really sell just wasn't so. 
[02:09:30]  And it seems like they deny a lot of the things.  Like, Bugliosi raised a good point in his book about how a fact that supports things just being the way we think they are is ignored by a lot of theorists, and an innuendo that appears to ruin the fact is taken as fact.  Let me tell you a story. 
[02:10:00]  The person that ran the funeral home, and he's a very wealthy guy.  He owns a bunch of funeral homes all over the state of Texas now.  He was a young man at the time.  The FBI came in, put black ink on Oswald's hand, and then put the black ink on the gun.  I interviewed him.  He actually showed up at a radio event for 590 AM, a station I'm on, and it turned out to be him.  It turned out to be the guy, a famous guy. 
[02:10:30]  And he went further than ever, and he said, come to my house sometime this week, and I'll give you a full interview.  And about two hours before I was there to interview him, he was riding with his wife in a wealthy area of Austin and got run off the road and has now been unable to talk to me because he got hurt so bad.  I mean, you want to talk about hardcore.  Number one, I'm a great shot with a rifle, you know, born and raised in Texas.  I've gone out in the field with that type of cruddy post-World War I rifle, and you can't hit the side of a barn with it. 
[02:11:00]  I mean, you can't barely even shoot it three times in six seconds, even though one round's already chambered, much less aim the thing.  And, I mean, hundreds of witnesses saw plumes of smoke and men behind the knoll, and the railroad operator who was 50 yards away in the railroad tower, who they killed two days later when he went public, I mean, he saw the men shooting.  He saw them in the green pickup truck.  I mean, they were running around killing people left and right. 
[02:11:30]  I mean, my family's from Dallas.  My family, it's just incredible.  I had family who were cops in Dallas.  I've interviewed Fort Worth Star-Telegram reporters who were friends with Ruby and drank at his topless bar.  Well, the guy, let me say the guy, the shot.  Now, again, you say that it's an impossible shot to make, and I had heard that there was, I think, a specialist.  I don't want to say his name wrong.  I think his name was Miller, who not only reenacted the. . .  Yeah, they have Discovery Channel puff pieces. 
[02:12:00]  The shooting.  Where all the facts are wrong, and where the guns were, and on and on and on.  But I'm saying I've heard that that shot had been reenacted by a guy who actually used the actual gun and actually improved a little bit on Oswald's time.  And I've also heard. . .  Do you know what Fletcher Prouty said?  No, but he's the one, by the way, just so people know, he's the one that Mr. X, Donald Sutherland's character.  But, I mean, Fletcher Prouty wrote The Secret Team.  It's on record.  He was the head of black ops for the entire Pentagon as liaison to CIA. 
[02:12:30]  And it's on. . .  I mean, they had Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, even the Dallas Morning News, who's been one of the biggest absconders with the truth on the JFK assassination,  two years ago had to admit that the government itself, but a subcompartment, did bullet fragment tests and found it wasn't the same bullet.  I mean, do you know what happens if you fire a full metal jacket bullet into water?  It bends more than that did that shot through two people, three or four bones, and a car seat.  I mean, do you know what happens to a hollow nose? 
[02:13:00]  A hollow nose comes out. . .  A soft tip comes out better than when you shoot hard objects because it's able to bend quicker.  If you shoot metal and bones with a full metal jacket, it shatters.  Okay?  It shatters.  The bullets shatter.  Guys, guys, go out and buy a brisket or buy a big side of beef that's got a bone in it,  and go out with a 30-odd six at 100 yards away and shoot through the meat and the bone with a full metal jacket round. 
[02:13:30]  And that full metal jacket round is going to look like hammered crap.  So, let me ask you this.  This is what doesn't make sense to me.  Why go through all that?  Like, they want to kill Kennedy.  They want to use Oswald to do it.  They want to do it in plain view so that everybody that could think would know,  we're the mafia.  We've taken over America.  It's a black op.  We rule any politicians that get in our face.  Why not just kill Oswald? 
[02:14:00]  Why do you have him shoot J.D. Tippett?  Why not just kill?  Like, they can't be such geniuses and so capable of cover-up and yet make such glaringly easy-to-fix mistakes.  Like, why allow Oswald to ever be taken in for questioning?  Why not?  I mean, again, if they could set all this up, you pen a phony suicide note and Oswald blows his brains out.  But that's a much simpler – why do you get Jack Ruby involved? 
[02:14:30]  That's a good point.  For most of the experts I've talked to in the history, he got nervous, just like Tim McVeigh got nervous of being set up.  Lee Harvey Oswald got nervous and didn't go where he was supposed to go.  And it also turns out that, you know, one of these other cops was a literal look-alike.  I mean, it's now been declassified that, yes, he was at a U-2 spy base in Japan.  And, yes, he did have national security clearance.  I mean, no one is allowed to defect to the Russians in the late 1950s, early 60s, and then come back to the United States. 
[02:15:00]  I mean, this guy had his address next to the FBI and the CIA in New Orleans.  I mean, you've got – guys, guys, listen, in any black op, in any big operation, they create an artificial fog of war.  I'm surprised they didn't have a fat lady running around naked that day painting herself blue, you know, with a paint roller.  I mean, I'm surprised they didn't have airplanes fly over and, you know, throw ostriches out on top of the city.  They always do confusing things to create confusion to where it gets so confusing that even good investigators can't ever figure out. 
[02:15:30]  But why make such a – sorry to interrupt you, Alice.  Why make such a glaring – because I've heard – again, I can't argue the bullet because I don't know enough about the physics of it.  But I've heard it debated.  I have heard it debated.  And I found that the – what I've heard in the film JFK about the magic bullet theory wasn't correct.  Now, why make such a glaring, easy-to-prove error? 
[02:16:00]  Like, it just doesn't make – that these geniuses can be influential enough to set up the president.  And they make that mistake.  Sure.  Look, let's just move on from the JFK assassination because the – I mean, you can – I'll keep talking about it if you want.  But over 90 percent of Americans now in polls – it was just 80 percent a few years ago – believe that the government's lying about what happened with JFK.  And I understand that it becomes popular to be contrarian. 
[02:16:30]  And I've been trying to make a JFK film for five years.  And it does become such a big quagmire, a tar baby, where there's disinformation on both sides.  There's lies on both sides.  The issue is the preponderance of the evidence is JFK and Bobby – and I've talked to JFK's secretary, by the way – were fearing for their lives.  They had been death-threaded.  Oh, sure.  Of course.  A powerful man.  President attorney general, yeah.  At that time, especially, yeah. 
[02:17:00]  Sure.  Well, I mean, it has been declassified that L.L. Lemnitzer, the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, came to Kennedy.  And sadly, Bobby green-lighted it.  That's been declassified.  That's ABC News, Baltimore Sun.  But JFK said no.  They wanted to bomb D.C., bomb Miami, shoot cops in Miami.  They wanted to attack U.S. military bases and claim that Cuban terrorists –  they wanted to launch a fake war on terror.  They even had in there how to – it's called Operation Northwoods.  Yeah.  They even had in there ways to grab patsy Cubans who they'd put on trial and then execute. 
[02:17:30]  Now, isn't this more of a not where we want to do this, we're going to do this, than a let us look at every option we can to get into Cuba and get rid of Castro?  Obviously, it covers – you know, these days, whenever you go into a war, you cover everything from a knife fight to nuclear weapons.  This was not a scenario.  This was not a scenario.  And everything in between.  No, no, no.  It wasn't just some idea bantered, ballied about between each other. 
[02:18:00]  This was not a scenario.  You can Google Operation Northwoods, National Security Archive.  But let me just tell you, this was declassified in 2000, National Security Archive released in 2000, the actual Operation Northwoods.  Then, four months ago, the State Department declassified its memorandums and minutes of meetings with Lemnanser, with Bobby Kennedy, and with JFK.  And the original communique and the original battle plan is an operational plan that had been green-lighted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and they were asking for approval to invade. 
[02:18:30]  So this was a Bay of Pigs, Cuban Missile Crisis-era plan.  This is what they wanted to do.  And Bobby said, well, actually, let's attack our embassy in Honduras instead of killing U.S. citizens.  Bobby said, I don't mind killing a few people, but let's not have it be actual embassy staff in Honduras. 
[02:19:00]  And then let's say Cuba did that.  It's too incredible to say that Fidel Castro would attack the U.S.  And so they took that to Kennedy, and then he fired Lemnanser, and he fired the Dulles brothers and the head of the CIA.  And no, it's on record that this was an operational green-light battle plan.  And Kennedy had also given the order to recall our troops from Vietnam.  He'd signed an executive order to begin abolishing the Federal Reserve. 
[02:19:30]  I don't think anybody's disagreeing that there was a lot of motives to have JFK kill.  Honestly, you might be right about all that.  I don't know.  I'm not saying you're wrong.  And I'm not saying there weren't a lot of motives to have any president killed.  But what I'm giving you is absolute admitted government fact.  Gulf of Tonkin was staged.  They did plan to stage terror attacks in the U.S.  Even his brother agreed but said do it in Latin America.  And Kennedy said no.  And they said, you think you're the president.  Well, bang, you die. 
[02:20:00]  We're going to blow your head off in plain view.  We're going to show everybody else in the establishment that the CIA can control the media, that we can kill a president in plain view, and kill hundreds and hundreds of witnesses.  And hundreds and hundreds of people were killed that were witnesses to the fact.  Hundreds were killed.  Do you hear how – the thing I have – the issue I have with that is like – and then there's disinformation to me that the conspiracy guys buy.  Like, well, Oswald was a terrible shot.  First of all, he was a sharpshooter.  He was not a terrible shot.  That was a terrible rifle. 
[02:20:30]  He was a terrible – but there's that myth that he was a terrible shot and he was not a terrible shot.  He classified as a sharpshooter and as a marksman before he left the military.  And to think that they would use such a blundering –  That guy wasn't a communist.  He's on record now.  C.I.A.  No, the point I'm making is why would they use –  Guys, let's go back to that.  But Alex, why would they use a bad shot?  Like, I'm just – very basic common sense things.  Like, they're going to pull this off.  You know what?  This is a straw man argument.  Listen, you know what a straw man argument is, right?  No, I don't. 
[02:21:00]  But it's what makes me question.  For some of your audience who may not, let me just tell them.  Okay, Alex Jones says the Caribbean is aquamarine blue at high noon.  Alex Jones says that if you go down to Belize at high noon on an average day,  that the beautiful waters are aquamarine blue, light blue, and that the sand is white.  Now, somebody goes out on the Internet and they say no.  In the Caribbean, the sand is purple and the water is black, 
[02:21:30]  and there are sea monsters swimming around in it.  That's what Alex Jones said.  Okay, listen, there are – what a conspiracy theory is with the dominant,  controlled dinosaur corporate media, what we're sold as a conspiracy theory,  as anything, any thought outside of the established, received knowledge given to us by ABC,  CBS, NBC, or Fox News.  Okay, the dry, stale, teleprompter, dying media.  Anything outside of that is called speculation, opinion, conspiracy theory. 
[02:22:00]  It's a way to put something in a box.  It's a way to minimize people's ideas.  Because it's a way to put a stereotype on it.  But I'm not doing that, but I'm not doing that to you.  But what I'm trying to finish saying, and you're being very kind, but let me just finish this because it's key,  is that I can't speak for the millions of kooks out there that call themselves conspiracy theorists,  who make things up and then who discredit real discourse.  But there are people who defend the establishment and still say that there were WNDs in Iraq and Bush didn't lie about it 
[02:22:30]  when we have the government documents, White House and Downing Street memos, where they knew there weren't WNDs.  I think that's pretty well accepted these days.  I'm not talking about that.  I'm not even saying you're wrong about that.  And what I'm talking about is the myths that are held by a lot of conspiracy theorists about Oswald's shooting ability and things like that.  And you don't hear conspiracy theorists coming out and going, well, you know what?  That's incorrect.  He actually was a good shot.  There were actually people on the fifth floor who heard the shell casings hitting from the floor above. 
[02:23:00]  Like, there's a lot of things that have happened.  And then people hang on to the fact that, like, well, the House Select Committee on Assassinations said, yes, it was a conspiracy because of some audio thing that they heard.  It's like you just don't hear the conspiracy theorists owning up to anything.  Well, in 1979, the congressional long investigation found that there was a 95 percent chance that it was a conspiracy and that other people were involved. 
[02:23:30]  And I'll tell you, I think you're right about that.  Well, I mean, I've got a copy of the report.  I'm saying I think you're right about that.  I just don't have it in front of me.  But the evidence was not based on medical evidence.  It was not based on any type of physical evidence.  It was based on acoustics.  I've interviewed Dallas Morning News reporters who talked to the surgeons at Parkland who said his brain was completely blown out.  And then they gave us a fake brain and put it in a glass jar.  And then when that became an investigation, it was robbed. 
[02:24:00]  It disappeared out of the National Archives.  I mean, come on, guys.  He was at a CIA spook base.  But hold on.  But I mean, the guy was at a total black ops base in Japan, was allowed to go into Russia to bring back a Russian wife.  He was a deep cover national security operative.  So if that's true, why use him?  Why use a guy?  They always burn their military black ops lower level people.  So they take a guy like that, they allow him to do it, and then they allow him to be picked up in question by the Dallas police? 
[02:24:30]  Look, I don't know if he did it.  You know, that's the problem.  We're all being targeted.  And they are putting soft kill, binary weapons in the food and water.  They call it the scientific dictatorship, the final revolution.  Final, final, final revolution.  And degenerative diseases are all off the charts, and the UN has been caught adding live polio to shots worldwide.  They've been caught adding live cancer viruses to every major vaccine.  Who is skull and bones?  Who is skull and bones?  Who is skull and bones?  Who is skull and bones?  You have satanic rituals going on with the guys that founded the CIA. 
[02:25:00]  CIA?  We're smarter than you.  We kept it secret for your own good.  It is a kind, gentle authoritarianism, an oppressive system for your own good, social Darwinism, the final revolution.  We're going to have a one-world government that enforces a one-world, one-child policy.  Who is skull and bones? 
[02:25:30]  Who is skull and bones?  Who is skull and bones?  Who is skull and bones?  Al-Qaeda, Al-C-I-A-da, that we admittedly created in the 80s, created in the 80s.  Al-Qaeda, created in the 80s.  Al-C-I-A-da.  There's war, famine, and sterilization programs to reach the goals.  Social Darwinism, the final revolution.  So they pump the poisons into you, and the soft-kill, degenerative weapons that take time, and so no one notices it until decades later. 
[02:26:00]  Then they use high-tech science and expensive drugs, now that you're a retiree, to suck all the money out of you, in the process of slowly killing you.  Who is skull and bones?  Who is skull and bones?  Who is skull and bones?  Who is skull and bones?  That's the Opinion 3, President's Day Special.  Sam, in just a few moments, we're going to be talking to our old friend, Sean Hannity.  Oh, oh, oh.  I was about to ask, how am I supposed to ingest moments?  But you meant ingest, not ingest. 
[02:26:30]  Ten weeks of that same joke, still not...  You don't get it?  No, I get it.  I'll explain it to you one day.  Sean Hannity calls into the show when we get back.  He's a friend of the show.  You know him from Fox News.  We know him as the guy on the other end of the telephone.  Sean Hannity, when we come back.  More of Opinion 3, President's Day Special coming up on the virus.  The virus.  It's the Opinion 3, President's Day Special.  Here are your hosts, Sam and E-Rock.  It's the worst of Opinion 3, it's President's Day, so we're going to do this political special. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, actually, we've been doing this political special that you've been listening to.  I'm E-Rock, he's primetime Sam Roberts.  Sam, time to time, we like to get an expert in a certain field.  When a certain event happens, the elections have just happened for 2010, and we get Sean Hannity on the phone.  Yes, political commentator extraordinaire Sean Hannity called into the Opinion Anthony Show.  You know him from Fox News.  He's a friend of ours, believe it or not, a fan of Opinion Anthony.  He's had Anthony on, he's had Jim on. 
[02:27:30]  He wants to get Opinion, but Opinion will not take the bait.  Sean Hannity calls in to talk about Election Day.  And the reason that Opinion doesn't vote.  On the Opinion Anthony Show.  It's the Opinion Anthony, President's Day special.  How the fuck did that happen?  Well, how many people got kicked out?  Was it a bloodbath ant?  Yeah, yeah, it's the biggest turnover in 70 years or so.  Seventy?  Yeah, the biggest political turnover as far as the House goes.  And the Senate got real close, too. 
[02:28:00]  They don't have as big a majority as they used to.  Isn't it amazing?  The same thing that got the Democrats in, which was discussed with the Republicans.  Yeah.  Got them out a couple years later.  Two years later.  People have just had enough.  Really?  They have.  And Obama spent all that time instead of trying to run the country.  The president should be forced to sit in the fucking White House and run the country.  Not campaign for people.  Not campaign while you're on the job.  You know what's amazing?  What happened?  Or do it on your vacation time or something.  Whatever.  Fucking figure something out.  When was the last time you saw our blind as a bat governor do anything? 
[02:28:30]  True.  He's been out of the news.  He hasn't done anything.  Are we done with him now?  In January.  In January.  Right, right, right.  But, like, you think he's going to do anything now?  Nah.  Lame contact action.  He hasn't even been in the news.  He hasn't done anything.  Your boy's on the line.  Oh.  He's not my boy.  Sean Hannity.  What is your boy stuff?  Hi, Sean.  Did you show up and vote yesterday?  Me?  No, I don't vote.  I absolutely did.  Anthony voted, yes.  No, Anthony voted.  Yes.  Who else was in today? 
[02:29:00]  Norton.  I had an injury.  I couldn't vote.  You pulled a hammy.  You couldn't get down there.  Yeah, I was injured, Sean.  What was the injury?  I hurt my arm when I should have registered a while ago, and I didn't.  I know.  Jimmy, you don't vote.  No.  You're killing me.  I know.  I admit I'm an ass.  I don't, though.  Yeah.  I voted, and then I watched the results.  A couple of surprises that I'd like to talk to you about.  This is a massacre. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, I know.  I know.  Absolute massacre.  I want to know how Harry Reid held on to his job.  You know, I've got to tell you, that was, for me, the biggest surprise of the night.  Absolutely.  In a way, look, he has an effective machine out there.  You know, we got reports that people that work in some of the casinos, like Harris and  others, you know, were being told by their bosses, go out and vote, guys.  You know, so there was a lot of pressure, a lot of union support that he has, and, you 
[02:30:00]  know, I like Sharon Engel a lot.  I got to meet her.  I've interviewed her a number of times.  We did our Freedom Concert out there, and she went on stage.  Lovely woman.  I thought, you know, she probably could have run a better campaign in terms of her communication,  but she's not a professional politician, so I think that might have hurt her a little  bit, and, you know, Harry Reid was vicious, absolutely brutal.  Yeah, but you look at the issues, you know, highest unemployment and just in bed with every 
[02:30:30]  step of the way with Pelosi and Obama, you would think that out of anybody, he would have  been the one showing the door, but, ugh.  He would have been kicked in, well, what do we say, Norton?  Would have been kicked right there and out the door.  Yeah, I don't usually say it right there, but she's on the phone.  Now, let's go back to Opie.  Opie, what happened?  Oh, why are you beating me up?  Why the hell are you beating me up?  What?  Now, first of all, why won't you come on, Hannity, the TV show?  Norton comes on.  He's obsessed with me being on his show.  He's on the TV show. 
[02:31:00]  Yes.  You know, Anthony comes on and kicks butt on the TV show, and I keep saying, well, where's  Opie?  What's up with Opie?  Can we talk pop culture or something?  I don't want to talk politics.  Well, we could talk pop culture.  What do you want?  You don't talk pop culture.  Listen, you don't know the first thing about pop culture.  Just like I don't know shit about politics.  What do you want me to tell you about pop culture?  What do you know about pop culture?  Ask me a question.  I'll tell you if I know anything about it.  Name three people from the Jersey Shore. 
[02:31:30]  Snooki.  Okay, good.  And I forget the other side.  You knew Snooki.  Ask me if I've ever watched an episode.  No, ask me to name three senators.  I couldn't do it, so.  You know, but here's the point, and Anthony will tell you this, too.  Do you even care?  Do you look at, like, how much?  Look, I know you're a zillionaire, and you make a lot of money with the radio.  Yeah.  All right.  But do you even care that if you live in New York, you're going to pay six out of every,  60 cents out of every dollar in taxes? 
[02:32:00]  Does that not eat away at your mind?  If I knew how much money I made, it would.  A long time ago, I decided not to really know how much money I make.  That's unbelievable.  I'm serious.  It destroys me.  It is the bane of my existence to sit there and watch them just keep digging into my pockets  and making us the villains, yet the supporters.  And we've got to sit in the back.  We're the enemies. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, yeah.  The bad guys, because you've done everything that this country, the opportunities that this  country has.  You've used the opportunities, made something of yourself, and all of a sudden, you're the  bad guy.  Do you know how many people, Anthony, I swear, have come up to me and said, I can't believe  I listen to Opie and Anthony all the time, and Anthony really knows his stuff.  And then they think, what's up with Opie?  Oh.  I have all the things to do. 
[02:33:00]  Let me ask you a basic question, Sean Hannity.  You want to go on offense?  Here we go.  Let's get on.  No, no, no.  And I actually enjoy watching you on the TV.  I do.  You know that.  All right.  Now, you said, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  You said there was a bloodbath last night, right?  It was a bloodbath.  Okay, this is, I'm going to go down to the basics, because that's how I deal with politics.  What will change now that there is a bloodbath last night?  I'll tell you, it's like America's boat was taken on water, and the boat's about to sink. 
[02:33:30]  And what was sinking was the American dream.  What was sinking is America's land of opportunity.  What's, you know, look, if you lived your life the way government was working now, where  literally, you know, we took on, in the short time that Obama was president, $3 trillion  in new debt.  That's more debt than every president from Washington up to and including the eight years of Ronald  Reagan.  And we did it because, you know, look, Obama, when he talked about change, was not just 
[02:34:00]  talking about changing Washington, but literally transforming American society away from an  opportunity society, where, you know, people would be pioneers, and they'd work hard, and  they'd take care of their families.  You know, when my grandparents came here to this country, they didn't have guaranteed health  care.  They didn't have guaranteed daycare.  We weren't bailing out banks and financial institutions.  Government wasn't buying car companies.  We weren't spending recklessly with this Keynesian economic model of redistribution. 
[02:34:30]  America was a land where, you know, individuals were responsibility for their own life.  You know, look, I would argue, I've listened to you guys enough over the years, you don't  want government in your life when it comes to what it is you can or cannot say on the  radio.  You don't want anybody in the government in your private life, in terms of what it is  you're doing, who you're dating, who you're sleeping with, what you're doing.  I'll take the one point on, because I see Norton, too.  I don't worry about what the government says as far as what we can say on the radio. 
[02:35:00]  I worry about the company itself now, the special interest groups, corporations in  general.  They're way out of control before the government is.  And, Sean, to be honest, when it comes to what we do on the air, and believe me, the  Democrats' political correctness is sickness, but I think the Republicans made it worse for  us.  And I hate to say that, but I really do.  I think it was a lot worse for us when the fines get tenfolded on terrestrial radio. 
[02:35:30]  And that was all the morality of conservatives, and that's where they lose me.  That was Tipper Gore.  That was a lot of people.  It wasn't me.  I make sense at the First Amendment.  And I can tell you, as a conservative, and in this sense I have a lot of libertarian leanings,  I don't want the government telling anybody what they can and cannot say on the radio.  Look, here's the environment.  Look, you guys are on satellite, which I know has grown by leaps and bounds, and you have  a freedom that I can tell you that does not exist for me on terrestrial radio. 
[02:36:00]  There are people, and I can prove it to you, who have in some cases George Soros money, whose  only job is to sit in their underwear every day in the hopes that me or Rush or Levin or  Bortz or any talk show host or Imus, that we say one word, one sentence, one phrase, and  they don't like it.  And they then get that information out to special interest groups, and then they begin 
[02:36:30]  either one or two campaigns.  They target your advertisers.  That's an attempt to silence your speech.  Or they go directly at your company and try and get you fired for what it is you said.  It's mob tactics they use.  I find you to be the exception, though.  You're the exception rather than the rule when it comes to conservatives.  You're right.  That is more libertarian.  You're one of the very few guys on that side of the fence that really does go to bat for  guys like this show.  And I remember when we were kicked off the air, you're one of the very few guys that  does.  But that's where the conservatives lose me a lot. 
[02:37:00]  Well, you know, look, there are some people, it's a very simple solution if you don't like  what you're hearing on the radio.  Turn the dial.  Right.  You were one of the few that stuck up for Imus, and man, you stuck up for us, too, which  was amazing.  I'm like, why is Sean sticking up for us?  Is it crazy?  You know what it is?  We're duty joke guys.  You are a throne of my side.  Yeah.  It goes in phases, too, honestly, because I don't think what's on the  radio is going to be of concern to a lot of Republicans right now.  I think they have the work cut out for him, patching the holes that were made in the past 
[02:37:30]  two years with Obama in there and Pelosi.  Thank God she's done.  Oh, I don't have to...  We don't want to manage everybody's expectations.  Look, these guys are going to get in there, and they're going to vote to repeal health care.  That's great.  Yeah.  But the president's not going to let it down.  He's going to veto it.  Yeah, of course.  They're going to vote to extend the Bush tax cuts.  Maybe it happens.  Maybe it's temporary.  Maybe it's not.  I don't know.  They're going to vote to rein in spending.  There's going to be major fights on this. 
[02:38:00]  And I think what's going to happen is you're going to see emerging two very different visions  and choices for 2012.  And Republicans are going to make the argument, look, we only have the House of Representatives.  You guys got the Senate.  You got the White House.  The president has power.  If you give us the power, all these things that we did in the House, we will nationalize.  And depending on what the state of the economy is at the time and whether or not some of this  Keynesian spending gets under control, I think Obama's in trouble. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  I think the Republican Party has to start really grooming somebody now.  Agreed.  Or else, again, like, look at what happened here in New York as far as the governor goes.  There was no hope for any Republican to try to challenge Cuomo.  I'm amazed they didn't have anybody here in New York there, Sean.  Yeah.  Look, the New York Republican Party, I will tell you, it's almost nonexistent. 
[02:39:00]  It's a disaster.  Chuckie Schumer's back in there.  By the way, could you imagine if Harry Reid lost, he'd be the guy?  I know, yeah.  I mean, it's almost, there might be one silver lining.  Exactly.  That it's not Schumer.  Hey, is it true that you guys have already called the 2012 election at Fox News and you're  calling Obama losing?  Is it true that you know nothing about politics?  Yes, it is.  What do you think?  Obama's done now in 2012?  What are the deep shots?  Here it is. 
[02:39:30]  You avoid my television.  And Norton comes on and Anthony comes on and I say to them, why won't Opie come on?  I'll tell you why.  Because, you know, we were supposed to do dinner many times and you blow me off.  So I'm supposed to see that beautiful.  You've never invited me to dinner.  You've never invited me to dinner.  I'm supposed to see that beautiful house of yours, you know.  Absolutely not.  On the little island where you have to give all sorts of IDs and bring your passport just  to get through the guard tower.  You know, I live in a building here in New York.  Yeah, that's the best. 
[02:40:00]  Are you married?  Did you get married?  Oh, my God.  You don't even know the first thing about me.  Well, you had a kid, I heard.  Yeah, I've been married almost two years and my son is almost six months old.  What are you going to do when your kid turns out to be exactly like you?  No, I don't think he is.  I don't think he is.  He's already smarter.  Let me ask you.  Have you noticed, despite this election, that Jim Norton has not been on your program in  a while?  Yeah, actually, I have noticed.  Thank you.  You know, one of the things, I've got to give Norton a lot of credit.  When we first started putting Norton on the program, because over the years I've listened 
[02:40:30]  to your guys' show a lot, although my hours are very different now.  And so, you know, believe it or not, I'm like on an hour and a half sleep and I'm getting  my kids up for school now, which is why I figured I'd call you and then go back to bed.  Wow.  But, Norton, I give you the, I watched him on HBO.  My wife and I were up one night and we were watching your HBO special and we're laughing  our heads off.  Oh, thank you.  And like, you're scheduled to be on the next night.  Oh. 
[02:41:00]  Every other word is a bleepable word.  And I'm saying, oh, no.  I mean, we're laughing.  We're enjoying it.  And I'm telling my wife, yeah, you see, he's going to be on the great American panel.  And she goes, good luck.  But, you know what, you always know where the line is and I give you a lot of credit  for it.  Everyone loves having you on because you're really funny.  Thanks.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like you can't go on Fox or any network and be, you know, HBO is one thing.  Yeah, it's just not appropriate.  Yeah.  You know what's good is, and the other thing is, is people have told me about you, Anthony, 
[02:41:30]  is that they just see another side of you.  I guess Opie brings out the worst in you and I kind of bring out the worst.  Yeah, there's something about the atmosphere of the two shows.  They're a lot different.  Well, you know, it's funny because once you start working hard, you know, what do they  say?  If you're 20 and not a liberal, you don't have a heart.  If you're 40 and you're paying taxes and you're not a conservative, you don't have a  brain.  Right.  This is true.  I, I, the, the, one of the biggest issues I have is, uh, is taxes and, uh, the fact 
[02:42:00]  that I pay so much in taxes and then I'm being told it's not enough.  Isn't that amazing?  That is, is, is infuriating.  And then you can't even really argue any point because people just be, well, if you didn't  have it, you wouldn't have to pay it.  And it's like, no, that, that isn't what this is about.  This is about people.  It's what you were saying before.  People mistake, um, opportunity for a right.  There's not a right in this country to be wealthy and, and, uh, to prosper and a life, 
[02:42:30]  liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  It's not the right of happiness.  And some people, I'm sorry, they're, they're going to have to work harder than other people.  That's, that's how this country works, but, but, uh, they've gotten ingrained in their  head that it's a, a God given right that if you're born in this country, you have to,  uh, live off of the, the people that have, uh, made something of themselves.  You know, all of us and, and Norton, you, I know a lot of comics and, uh, I know a lot 
[02:43:00]  of people that have radio stories when, and, and, and, you know, you think back in your  early days, you guys got behind a radio microphone and you fell in love with it.  That's what happened to me.  You know, I was, I was working my way in and out of school and, and I'd go to school  and I'd run out of money and I'd go back to work and I was involved in contracting.  I've done every job there is.  My father worked at restaurants.  You know, I started out as a dishwasher and bus boy and bartender and, and waiter. 
[02:43:30]  And, and I've, I've, you know, hung wallpaper and I painted houses and I laid tile and  I framed houses and I, I fell off a roof, three stories right on my head.  Fizzy guy.  Yeah.  You know, that's when I was, it became a conservative, Opie.  Uh, and so you think, but you think of you first, you, all you guys, we get behind a  microphone for the first time.  Yeah.  And I, I fell in love with it.  I wanted to do this for the rest of my life.  And I, uh, and I, uh, I worked for a year for free.  My first radio job paid me 19 grand a year. 
[02:44:00]  I've got hired over the phone.  I packed everything in the back of the van and I moved to Huntsville, Alabama.  Wow.  I didn't know that.  And, uh, well, you know, Norton, when you start out in comedy, you know, you go to the,  the worst places.  Yeah.  You pay your own way.  You get $25 a night.  If you're lucky.  It was a year before my first paid gig, a year.  And it was a $25 gig.  Yeah.  But you did it.  You followed your dream because you know what?  This is what you want to do. 
[02:44:30]  You wanted to be on stage.  You want to make people laugh and, and have a good time.  And this is what America is about.  Now we make those choices in life.  You know, look, there are some people that are going to bed right about now and they've  been up all night and they've been drinking and they've been partying and they're not  going to get up and they're not going to work hard tomorrow.  But there's a mentality among some in this country that they think they've been conditioned  to believe that America should provide them their health care.  If they have kids, their kids ought to get government run daycare.  You know, the rent is too damn high. 
[02:45:00]  You know, some people want, you know, landlords, individuals forced by the power of government  to subsidize their rent.  That's what rent control, rent stabilization in big cities like New York is all about.  And then there are those of us that think, you know what?  Get up.  Take care of your own life.  You live in the greatest, freest country in the world.  Stop expecting other people to do stuff for you.  If you're really sick, if you're elderly, if you're young and disabled, we're willing to  pitch in and help.  But this is not a permanent gig.  You've got to, at some point, learn how to fish yourself. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  What do you think of yourself?  A Republican I have a problem with is Bloomberg in this, because I think, first of all, I  don't think he's a Republican.  Exactly.  He's a very, he just took that because he couldn't get on a Democratic ticket.  How did he get himself exactly a fourth term and then spend a hundred million on the  election?  How does that happen?  I'm sorry, third term.  I'm sorry.  Now he's advocating that, you know, or, you know.  Third term.  Third term.  And now he's advocating everyone only have two terms.  Yeah.  Well, that's it.  He really is reprehensible.  That passed, by the way, didn't it?  It's only, we're down to two terms again, right? 
[02:46:00]  Well, what did he exactly do?  The last I saw was, I didn't see the final results.  Yeah.  How did that happen?  What exactly did he get passed?  Because it really makes me hate him.  Just, well, the referendum was, he gets three terms because America, you know, New York  really needed him at this time.  Yeah.  Apparently we couldn't survive without him.  But didn't we want Giuliani for a third term?  Yeah.  I want to take Giuliani for a third term.  And wasn't he the guy that said, no, no, you know, we got term limits.  The system has to work for a reason.  Yeah.  Look, there was, you know, that was actually Washington, George Washington's mentality, 
[02:46:30]  although we did have, you know, FDR, you know, and.  Yeah, he was trying to hold the job like a Pope.  Yeah, pretty much.  That's one way to look at it, Anthony.  Yeah.  The white smoke coming out.  Yeah.  All right, so now it's back to two terms.  So it was bad for Rudy to stay in action.  What is Giuliani going to do?  I loved him as mayor of New York.  I think he's thinking of running for president.  You know, if you want my list, I think Palin is really considering it.  I think Newt's considering it.  Palente's considering it. 
[02:47:00]  I would not be surprised.  I think Christie will be considered vice president.  I think Bobby Jindal may not run, but he'd be a great vice president.  I also think one day he could be a great president.  Watching from yesterday's election, Marco Rubio is a rising star in the Republican Party.  He's got one of the most compelling life stories.  Why?  You know, the very things we've just been talking about.  He's a Cuban-American.  His family grew up in communism.  He comes to America.  This is the land of hope and opportunity. 
[02:47:30]  I think he was saying on the campaign trail, his dad was a bartender.  His mother was a maid.  And, you know, he always was brought up to believe you can be anything in America.  And he really articulates conservatism really well.  Did I say Romney?  I think he's going to get in it.  Yeah.  Do you think Palin's going to run as – she's going to want to be a president or vice president?  You know, well, if she runs, she'll be running for president.  I don't think she's made up her mind.  I mean, in the interviews that I've had with her and the time – she's on Hannity tonight. 
[02:48:00]  I'm going to ask her, obviously, but it'll be interesting to see.  I think she's doing a good job backing people and influencing the vote in that way.  And watching her on Fox News, she does come off a lot more informed than she did when she was on the vice presidential ticket.  She absolutely comes off more informed, and she's speaking a lot better than she did. 
[02:48:30]  Things aren't blindsiding her like they used to.  Look, I got to know her a little bit, and I like her, so maybe I'm defending a friend here.  But, you know, you think back – look, imagine a scenario where it's the summer before a really important election,  and you're a governor of a small state, and in her case, Alaska.  All of a sudden, you kind of get picked out of obscurity.  You weren't on everybody's, you know, top one, two, three, four, or five in terms of being picked as VP.  And you get pulled out of obscurity, and you get thrown into the national limelight. 
[02:49:00]  And then, you know, there's Charlie Gibson and Katie Couric, and they're on a mission to tear you down.  You've got a campaign that's scared to death.  You've got to make a mistake.  And, you know, so did this governor – do we all doubt that she knew what newspaper she read every day?  But she figured, you know, she couldn't win for losing.  If she says the Wall Street Journal, oh, you only read right-wing stuff.  Or the New York Post, oh, you're right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that was a setup, obviously. 
[02:49:30]  She should have just lied and said, I read the New York Times and the Daily News.  Yeah, but then they would have said to her, who's your favorite columnist?  Or who's your – you know, they would have hit her some way.  I'm weird with Palin.  I don't – I would not want to see her as president.  But I also think that part of her popularity is that she really did kind of just kind of come out from obscurity.  And the way she got attacked by the left, it was a really weird attack.  Like, what is it with attractive women who are on that side of the coin who just get brutalized? 
[02:50:00]  It's a really bizarre dislike of them that people have.  And I think that people who have her ideals have kind of rallied around her because they feel bad for her.  I think it's deeper than that.  The treatment of conservative women.  And, yeah, okay, so she's good-looking.  But think about this.  All the things that were said about her, her clothes, her looks.  You know, let's take her out of the equation.  Let's fill in the blank with Michelle Obama or Hillary Clinton or Barbara Boxer.  You know, or Jerry Brown's campaign. 
[02:50:30]  Granted, it was on a cell phone, but somebody on the campaign is calling Meg Whitman a whore.  You got Joy Behar calling Sharon Engel a bitch.  You know, imagine – all right, back to the terrestrial radio.  I mean, you guys can basically get away with whatever you want because you're opiate, Anthony.  You can.  But honestly, I don't even – would you ever call any Democratic woman a bitch?  No.  In an interview, no.  I wouldn't call any of them that, honestly.  On stage, you might.  On stage, yeah, but not in an interview.  On a comedy stage where you're eviscerating everybody. 
[02:51:00]  Right.  Yeah, but that's different.  Right, that's what I'm saying.  During an interview, I wouldn't do it.  No, but this happens to conservatives, all conservative women.  It's like fair game.  If I called Joy Behar a bitch, I might be fired.  And I've had the discussion even with comics about Palin.  And, again, honestly, I wouldn't vote for her.  I would not want to see her be president.  But I don't have this visceral dislike of her either.  And I've had guys go, like, she's dangerous.  I'm like, she's a conservative lady.  How is she dangerous? 
[02:51:30]  She's just a conservative lady.  That's it.  She's not dangerous.  Let me just point out one thing.  You know, she would advocate for lower taxes.  She wouldn't go with this ridiculous notion of shutting down Gitmo or giving, you know, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed a civilian trial.  She wouldn't stop using the term war on terror and call them man-caused disasters or overseas contingency operations.  She wouldn't go around the world apologizing for America. 
[02:52:00]  She wouldn't call America arrogant.  She would advocate for limited government, greater freedom, lower taxes, individual responsibility, a return to those simple constitutional principles.  You know, in the minds of a liberal, she's an idiot.  But Barack Obama, who has driven the country into a ditch, is a genius.  I don't get it.  I don't think she's an idiot or the person that she's painted to be by the media.  I don't buy that either.  But I do know that she's, you know, her thing is, look, she's pro-life, I think, right? 
[02:52:30]  That's her thing.  So there's a personal liberty that she would, I think, remove from people.  Again, she's too conservative for me.  I think she's too religious conservative.  Yeah, I'll take her over Barack Obama for president.  And I would take that in a heartbeat, please.  Yeah.  Because you're a happily married man, Sean.  I still need that law on the books.  Which law on the books?  Well, you know, pro-choice.  I'm still running around.  Listen, listen.  You really want to get into that?  Because, look, first of all, you meet the girl at the comedy club, and she comes up to you, 
[02:53:00]  Oh, Norton, you're wonderful.  You know, and then you start making your smooth moves.  And you have a lot of choices here.  I know, and I always make bad ones.  You know, how many shots of bourbon are you going to do?  I don't drink.  That's a choice.  I don't drink at all.  Yeah, Jimmy doesn't drink.  I just take my alcohol money and give it to them.  Yeah.  Get them drunk.  Yeah.  Because he's so bored with this discussion.  I went and got breakfast.  What's going on?  You're a pisser.  All right. 
[02:53:30]  So you make a choice.  You take the girl out to your car, right?  And then you make a choice to start making out with her.  And then you make a choice to start removing one article of clothing after another.  And then you make a choice that you're going to have sex.  And then you don't use any protection.  Those are a lot of choices there.  That's true.  Sean just gave us a look into his mind.  You know what?  I think the baby has a right to live.  Sean, did you stab sex in cars?  Never.  Yeah, I don't like the fact that you didn't give me the credit at least for taking her in my apartment.  Yeah, really?  Howie's got me as an animal. 
[02:54:00]  Look, you throw her on the hood.  You're out there in front of the entire audience.  They're applauding and booing at the same time.  Listen, I want to go right into the main themes.  I want Opie to be able to join the discussion.  All right.  Relax.  Relax.  I've had about five dates my whole life.  My wife and I met.  And I was in Huntsville, Alabama when I was doing the radio.  And from the day we met to the day we got engaged was three months.  And from the day we met to the day we got married was six.  Wow.  We were married 18 years. 
[02:54:30]  But why were you in a hurry?  Because I'm Catholic.  It's either get married or sin.  Oh, okay.  Oh, wait.  You're one of those guys?  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  I didn't know that.  What does that mean, one of those?  Don't you want to try it out a little bit first?  Those days I don't talk about anymore.  But, I mean, logically, wouldn't you want to try it out first?  You know, it's the old kick the tires argument.  I didn't need to.  She was great.  Well, for 18 years, obviously, it was the right move.  Something's working.  Something's working.  Yeah, we get along pretty good. 
[02:55:00]  I'm too indecisive.  She does?  What?  I'm too indecisive to do that, to make that kind of – I think my demons go too far in one direction to make that kind of a healthy decision.  Do you think it's bad to have sex out of marriage, though?  You know, look, I'm a Christian.  So, you know, what my personal belief is is that marriage is sacred and you should wait until you get married.  Wow.  Do I think most people live up to that standard?  No.  I'm pretty realistic about it.  But nor do I think I should impose my values on anybody else. 
[02:55:30]  But do you understand why people don't wait?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Of course.  All right.  All right.  He's on the second date looking for a chapel.  He gets it.  Down the aisle with, you know, Nike sneakers on saying, yes, I do.  How about gay marriage?  Are you completely against that?  I'm against – I don't think we should define or redefine marriage.  Look, this is where I am fairly libertarian in this way. 
[02:56:00]  I wouldn't change – I don't think we need to change the definition of marriage or what the traditional definition is.  But what people, adults do in the privacy of their own bedroom is none of my business, period.  I don't care.  You know, I just don't care what people do.  And why won't a lot of the – I guess the farther right conservatives kind of – I guess they're religiously influenced or whatever.  But, again, that's where they lose me a lot.  It's like they talk a lot about personal freedoms and the government not intruding, but they're very comfortable with the government intruding there. 
[02:56:30]  Or they're very comfortable with the government intruding on the issues that they feel are important.  And the liberals are also very comfortable with the government intruding on things that they feel are important.  It's like kind of both sides, I feel, balance each other out that way.  I think the most intolerant is the left, and especially when it comes to freedom of speech or people that they don't like or imposing values.  You know, every time they tax us to impose values, they've got this system or this value system that they think is superior. 
[02:57:00]  And that's that, you know, we have a role in society to take care of the less fortunate among us.  And so what they're going to do is force their morality on everybody by taking other people's money, or else they're going to take you out in handcuffs and off to jail.  And they think it's superior.  But, you know, if liberals are so generous, why don't they spend their own money in their cause?  Now, as it relates to the conservatives, you know, why does society have to change its definition of marriage to accommodate a lifestyle choice of other people? 
[02:57:30]  I would agree with that.  Why do people need the rest of society's approval?  Because I think because society's, again, to play devil's advocate, I think society's definition of something is exclusionary of certain groups who are kind of sick and tired of being excluded.  Meaning they feel it's an unfair definition.  And if society has an unfair definition, they probably want to change.  If it takes a male and a female to produce a child, would you disagree with me that a mother offers certain things to a child and a father offers certain things to a child that neither one could offer? 
[02:58:00]  Or, you know, I don't know, like a mom has a way to nurture kids that the father may not have.  A father has a way to really instill strength and discipline in their kids in a way that nobody else can.  So if it takes a man and a woman to make a child, and we agree that men and women bring different things in terms of nurturing a child, 
[02:58:30]  then how do you make the argument that it's okay for gay and lesbian couples to adopt?  Wow, Sean, I mean, your definition works in a perfect world, but there's a lot of shitty fucking mothers out there.  What are you talking about?  Boy, gee, did you, what happened when you grew up?  What?  There was an intensity behind that.  No, because it's funny.  You saw that coming.  Because that's just ridiculous.  It really is.  I mean, there's a lot of crap.  What's ridiculous about it? 
[02:59:00]  There's a lot of crappy parents out there where maybe the kid would be better off with two moms or two dads.  I'm just saying, and again, I'm asking.  You're absolutely right in a perfect world, but we don't live in a perfect world.  The thing I have an issue with is if it's about a mother, because we're defining marriage.  So if it's basically a mother and a father to create a child, that's like saying, well, let's just say that they can't have kids.  So then that part of what they could do is removed, but they're still allowed to be married. 
[02:59:30]  So you can't even base it to me on children, because let's just say that the father or the mother is unable to – or the male or the female is unable to have kids.  So to me, the marriage shouldn't be based in the idea of children.  All right, but let's just assume for a moment, you know, would any kid choose to – and my 12-year-old son just walked into the room here.  I've got to watch myself.  And it's his birthday today.  Say hi to Opie and Anthony.  Say hi.  Hello.  Happy birthday.  If you go downstairs, I'll meet you down there.  I'm going to give you a birthday present in two minutes, okay?  I promise.  I wonder what that is. 
[03:00:00]  I'll tell you what it is as soon as he leaves.  Yeah.  All right, good.  I hope it's something fun.  What do you think Sean gets his son?  I hope it's not O'Reilly's book.  I hope it's something fun.  A nice .22 rifle.  No, I'll tell you what I got him.  I got him on – hang on a second.  I got to look, because he's like me.  I used to open every Christmas.  I want to see if Sean's a good dad or not.  This is going to say a lot.  I got him an iPad, and he's wanted his cell phone for the first time, so I got him.  All right.  You're a solid dad.  Sean's a good and rich dad.  Yeah.  You're a great gift.  That's what you want.  That's pretty good. 
[03:00:30]  All right, but what was I going to say?  But again, I want you to realize I don't really care what people do, but it would put a lot  of kids, knowing maybe society's views on issues, is it ideal for kids to grow up with two  mommies or two daddies?  Maybe not.  I honestly – I don't know if there's enough history to show, but it's like the same  argument could be made if we're not 100% sure on interracial couples.  A lot of people find that, even though it's a male and a female, to be morally reprehensible.  A lot of people would even use the argument that God doesn't like it, and that would be 
[03:01:00]  used to –  Who would use that argument?  A lot of people.  A lot of people.  A lot of people.  I think you're looking a little more old school.  Maybe old school, but people who don't like it would use that argument to back up their  argument.  Because most people don't just say, I don't like something you can't do.  I think discrimination is horrible.  I really – I've got to go back to this main argument here, is that I'm libertarian.  Here's what I don't understand.  Why are so many people obsessed with, worried what other people in society think? 
[03:01:30]  If you want to live with somebody, if you want to sleep with somebody, and you're an  adult, I don't see people knocking on your door and saying, who are you sleeping with?  I don't think – you know what?  I think most people, if we get down to the absolute truth, most people are so wrapped  up in themselves, they don't care.  We all have this notion in life that everybody else is watching us, when in reality they're  not.  And as far as the definition, Sean, I think we redefine things a lot as to what we find  offensive or what's appropriate, and I think that that stuff kind of is changing. 
[03:02:00]  And again, I use race as an example only because it's something that at one point was  so frowned upon in this country.  And now if you look at an interracial couple and go, well, they shouldn't have children,  people would go, well, you're out of your mind.  Why not?  But 50 years ago, people would have said, oh, they shouldn't have kids.  It's bad for the kids.  The kids shouldn't be raised in that environment.  So I honestly don't know if it's bad for a kid to have two mothers, but I'm kind of  tired of people enforcing their morality on gay people and making them behave a certain way.  Now here's another – I'll take it to another level here, just for Opie's sake. 
[03:02:30]  You know, what about all religious people?  Well, you may not agree with them, but if we believe they have their right to raise  their children the way they see fit, right?  Yeah, yes, of course.  All right, so I'm a Christian in my life, and my faith tells me that either sex before  marriage is a sin or that gay relations is sinful, okay?  And let's say I want to instill those values in my children.  Sure.  And so I pay for these public schools.  I send my kids off to school, and then they go to school, and the values I'm instilling 
[03:03:00]  in my kids get contradicted by liberal teachers that say – you know, remember there was  a controversy back in New York, you know, some years ago where they were giving young  kids first, second, or third grade.  Heather has two mommies and two roommates.  Does the educational system and the government have the right to contradict the values of  the parent because they don't like their Christian values?  Whatever happened to freedom of religion?  I agree with you on that, but again, the same argument could be made for, say, Muslims who 
[03:03:30]  believe in Sharia law.  And they could say, well, they're showing us that boys and girls are equal, and we don't  believe that in this house.  We believe that a girl should have a veil on or should be forced to wear a burqa, and here  they are allowing them to run.  Or it's like religious stuff should be much more concentrated on in the home, because  I think that there's so many different religions that any public school cannot –  That means a public school should just stay out of it.  First of all, these kids can't read, write, or do math, so if we focused on that, we wouldn't  have to be aware of it.  Well, they may not – I agree with you, but they may not be looking at this – Heather  has two mommies as a religious issue. 
[03:04:00]  You know, they may not be looking at it that way.  I think the schools have gotten way too involved in people's lives.  Yep.  Instead of just teaching their kids, they're now trying to instill, yeah, some type of  their own liberal morality into them instead of just teaching them, which is ridiculous.  I think in an ideal world, you know, people want to have their own commitment ceremony  and whatever.  That's fine.  I don't think they need society sanctioning. 
[03:04:30]  I don't think – you know, it gets complicated after a while.  It really does.  Can we talk about Obama's defeat?  I did want to go back to that because wasn't it just amazing to see the man that, you know,  was changing and wasn't going to be politics as usual and was going to be transparent just  doing exactly the same thing you've seen Democrats do over and over again?  And even Republicans, just seeing them, he backed into a corner and just started bashing the 
[03:05:00]  GOP.  Well, I think it's worse.  I think – look, one of the things people were telling me, you know, when I first started  really looking into Obama and his background, you know, I got pretty fascinated pretty fast.  And, you know, all of a sudden I find that he hangs out with this guy, Jeremiah Wright.  You know, I interviewed Jeremiah Wright – it was the last interview he gave before the election 
[03:05:30]  of Obama.  Yeah.  I interviewed him in March of 2007 before the election in 2008.  And in that interview, I started going through what he called black liberation theology, you  know, and you can look it up, and it's pretty radical.  And by the way, its roots are in communism redistribution and, you know, for the black  family, the black community, the black – so I said, now, Reverend, if you changed the word  black with white, wouldn't a lot of people view that as racist?  And he got angry, and we started having a big argument on the TV show, and he never showed 
[03:06:00]  up on TV again after that.  Right.  And then you find out, well, the president sits on boards with and gives speeches with,  you know, a guy by the name of Bill Ayers, a guy that was part of the Weather Underground,  a group that blew up the Pentagon, the U.S. Capitol, and New York City Police Headquarters.  And I'm like, why would the president be sitting on a board with, giving speeches with a guy  with that radical background?  And then you dig a little deeper, and you're hanging out with this guy, Father Flager, and  this other guy, Tony Resco, and there's this other corrupt deal, and he worked with this 
[03:06:30]  group, Acorn, and he, you know, was teaching rules for radicals, and, you know, you find  a very radical president.  And what's amazing to me is, if you look at Barack Obama, the only thing he knows is  his radicalism.  His, you know, he ran a really effective communication operation in 2008, and what we've learned in  this election cycle is, you know, you can read your teleprompter when you're running for  president, and you can make all sorts of promises, and you can hire somebody to write these lofty 
[03:07:00]  speeches, but eventually you're going to have to run on your record.  And then when he had an opportunity to govern, I think the real story out of this is America  is rejected.  Yes.  Obama's radicalism.  Yeah, they did, and obviously that came out last night.  People not happy with the past two years, and they're going to talk about change.  Wow.  That's the biggest change in 70 years.  All right, now we're going to give the show back to Opie.  Oh, relax. 
[03:07:30]  How did you celebrate the big victory last night?  Did you crack a beer or something?  No, but I'll...  How does Sean Hannity get loose when something like what happened last night happens?  It's funny, because I drink like two or three drinks, and I got this dumb, stupid, you know,  Irish grin on my face, and I can't drink a lot.  Oh, God.  You don't drunk Twitter, do you?  That'd be funny.  Yeah.  Hannity drunk Twitter.  I better not hang out with Anthony, then, man.  You'd be in deep trouble.  I love my Twitters. 
[03:08:00]  And beers.  That's what I was getting.  And beers.  Huh?  Are you Twittering all the time, Anthony?  Not all the time.  Last night I was a lot.  Yeah, I was, you know...  And goes through stages.  Opie, did you, honestly, did you even watch last night?  Yeah, I watched a bit.  I watched a little bit.  I just think it's all horse shit in the end.  You don't...  How much money would I save if the Democrats ran everything?  You wouldn't.  I mean the Republicans.  I mean the Republicans.  I'm sorry.  You know, in an ideal world, you know, I'll tell you how dramatic it was when Reagan was president. 
[03:08:30]  I mean the top marginal rates, believe it or not, when he came into office after Jimmy Carter's disaster was 70%.  And he dropped it to 28%.  Wow.  So, you know, if you look at the top marginal rates now, if you live in New York, for example, it's going up to 39.5%.  Yeah, watch what happens after January 1st.  But think about this. Then you've got 10% state income tax or 9% state income tax on top of it. 
[03:09:00]  If you own a property, you've got property tax.  Sean, Sean, I understand that. I'm not as stupid as you think.  I know the taxes are completely out of control.  I want to know how much it drops if the Republicans ran everything.  I think if they dropped it in the right way that would stimulate the economy, I think they could increase their revenues and drop it 15%.  Here's one thing we ought to agree on.  If you work your entire life, you know, you've got a kid now, so you're a dad, and I assume your perspective is changing a little.  That's what happened to me 12 years ago.  My son was born on Election Day, 1998. 
[03:09:30]  Of course he was.  How crazy is that?  Of course he was.  And it was not planned.  My son was born on Mother's Day, so there you go.  Okay.  And I had a lot to take for a mother, so.  There you go.  Yeah, exactly. So it does work out in the end.  And I forgot the point I was going to make.  Yeah, good. That was my point.  Wait, no, 15% tax is probably dropping.  And your perspective changing, yes.  Yeah, you know, here's the – let's say you work your whole life, and you make all this money in radio, and you put your money away. 
[03:10:00]  And throughout those years, you're a good little liberal and a good citizen, and you pay back all – you pay all your money in taxes.  You have an account, and you do it right.  And then let's say you croak.  If you die on December 31st this year, you pay zero in a death tax.  If you die January 1, 55% of your estate goes to the government after you paid money on all that money.  Isn't that amazing?  That's sickening.  I think that's very healthy for my son. 
[03:10:30]  Healthy for your son?  My dad died. He didn't even have $1,000 in the bank for me.  Oh, God. Why would you want to perpetuate that then?  Let my son work it out.  Like you, my first radio job is $12,000.  Wow, you were overpaid.  Obviously, that's insane.  All right.  Well, that would be one that the Republicans want to eliminate the debt tax.  So we'll get rid of that.  Well, let's say you risk money.  I know Anthony's into the stock market, and he invests money. 
[03:11:00]  It's called the casino.  By the way, I hang out with Anthony in the casino.  I do like to play.  That is fun.  That might be against your Christian values.  No?  No, I'm not betting my milk money away.  I mean, I get paid a decent salary now.  That's where you see Hannity flipping the table and walking away.  There's got to be one place where you just go ballistic.  It's probably the casino.  No, I'm sitting there with Mark Levin.  We could actually sit there for hours and just play blackjack.  I'm obsessed with Sean.  What is the craziest thing you do? 
[03:11:30]  Do you get wild ever, Sean?  At this point in my life?  Did you ever, though?  I don't even think you ever did.  I'm 48 years old.  That's not old.  You know, I'll tell you what I do.  I work hard.  I've got a lot of hours that I put in.  But I honestly, every spare moment I have, I spend with my family.  I've gotten off the road a lot in the last number of years.  I mean, for a while I was traveling a lot.  And I'm not writing as much as I used to.  I wrote my last book this year.  I'm not writing anymore.  And I spend all my free time with my kids. 
[03:12:00]  My kids are very competitive tennis players.  So I travel.  They do some national tournaments.  I travel around the country.  They're good, huh?  They're good.  They're pretty good.  That's where we agree.  I mean, I'm all about family now.  Yeah.  That's what matters.  All right, guys.  I've got to run.  I really enjoyed it.  And continued success.  It's always good to talk to you.  And Anthony, I want to promise.  How about if I brought, we did the Opie and Anthony Great American Panel one day?  That would be cool.  That'd be cool.  That's you and Ant beating me up? 
[03:12:30]  Get the hell out of here.  You wouldn't even come to that.  Huh?  Well, first of all, you're pretty good.  You just come in with a couple of lines.  Slap me in the head if I get out of line.  I used to beat up your old partner there live on the show.  I actually said live on the show once.  Combs piped in.  I go, wow, he actually talks.  He gave me the look of death.  We were actually on Jon Stewart once.  And so Jon's talking to Alan for about five minutes.  I didn't say a word.  I say one word, and he goes, do you ever let him talk? 
[03:13:00]  I was like, okay, I'm losing this battle.  I'm going to shut up.  Hey, Sean, you know we love you.  I don't agree with everything you say, but I love you.  And I appreciate that you stick up for us every single time.  Listen, you guys are radio legends.  And you know what?  A lot of us that are infamous.  Oh, my God.  You are a prick, man.  Oh, that wasn't me.  Oh, my God. 
[03:13:30]  I don't know what happened to that.  That was a mistake.  Oh, God, what an ass.  He's probably sitting there laughing and falls off.  That'll be that prick.  Oh, God.  A lot of people are upset that it was a one-sided conversation.  Why?  But he was, we agree with something.  What do you want?  I can't represent.  I can't represent the Democrat.  I'm not a Democrat either.  I, what?  I agree with the guy.  What am I supposed to do?  A lot of people are saying, one-sided, one-sided. 
[03:14:00]  Who gives a shit one-sided?  Good.  One-sided.  Good.  One-sided.  Good.  I talked about what I wanted to talk about.  Yeah.  One-sided.  Good.  It's one-sided.  Go fuck yourself.  Go listen to fucking one of the liberal shit fucking talk shows if you want the other  side.  Go listen to them crying, crying in their coffee this morning.  It's the O.P.  And it's President's Day special.  Sam, still to come.  We're going to be talking to comedian, talk show host, political whatever, Pete Dominick. 
[03:14:30]  He works here at the company.  Political commentator, Pete Dominick.  He's got a show on POTUS, and he's a friend of the show.  He stopped by.  Did you just like the word?  I like to pop the peas.  Oh, Jesus.  He stopped by to talk to us.  Stop doing that.  He stopped by to talk to us about healthcare and some other things that were on the table.  So, stay, stop.  Stay tuned.  Pete Dominick is next.  POTUS.  I gave it the out and everything, and you did it.  More highbrow political discourse in moments. 
[03:15:00]  This is the ONA President's Day special on the virus.  The O.P.  and Anthony President's Day special continues on the virus.  Here are your hosts, Sam and E-Rock.  It's the worst of the O.P.  and Anthony show, President's Day special.  I'm primetime Sam Roberts.  My co-host is E-Rock.  Sam, it's comedian, political talk show host, Pete Dominick.  Well, the callers wanted to take their turn at Pete Dominick, so we get into that a little  bit with this one.  Pete Dominick, of course, a little bit left-leaning, where the callers have been well-conditioned  listening to Anthony and his rants to not appreciate what Pete Dominick was saying. 
[03:15:30]  But as I said earlier, my dad was emailing me and saying...  Which dad was that?  I just have one.  No, I thought you had two now.  We got you a second dad.  No, I just have the one dad.  He's the one with the mustache.  And he loved Pete Dominick.  And that's enough for me.  Was he the Dick Buckus character?  There were no characters.  Greg Evigan.  Pete Dominick continues on the O.P.  and Anthony show.  It's the O.P.  and Anthony, President's Day special.  What were you saying there, Ant?  I think we went off... 
[03:16:00]  Volkswagen.  Oh, Volkswagen.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I was going to ask you, do you think healthcare is a right in this country?  Absolutely.  Really?  In America, absolutely.  If it is in countries that are way worse than ours in every metric, then yes.  I like to think we're a better country.  I like to think we're better people.  But every other country in the civilized world, industrialized country, their government provides through taxes. 
[03:16:30]  It's not free, obviously.  Healthcare.  And they get way better results and they spend way less.  If we instituted what France has right now, we would decrease the deficit immediately.  Immediately.  But the statistics I've seen on, especially things like breast cancer, the United States is really in the lead with taking care of breast cancer patients.  There are a couple of metrics that we do better on, but very few.  Most, they do better on everyone.  And I think, honestly, we wouldn't have a system like France or like Canada. 
[03:17:00]  We would have a uniquely American one.  And we would still be the leaders in innovation, although that's definitely changing because pretty soon China is going to take over everything.  Thanks to us, by the way.  Don't blame China.  Blame us.  My dad goes, we're at war with China.  I'm like, that's because of us.  We let them do that.  You know what?  We just got to wait until they hit their fucking bubble and it pops and they have their depression.  They won't be doing that.  At some point, you can't sustain. 
[03:17:30]  You know, we have our ebbs and flows financially in this country.  When we become a third world country and stop buying their junk, they will go out of business.  Then they'll go out of business.  That'll be the end of China.  But, no, you said why, you know, we have better, you know, on certain things than other countries.  And I'll give you that.  Probably certain cancer treatments, but mostly no.  Mostly no on everything.  You don't think this will have an effect on things like research and development?  No, absolutely not.  Certainly not on research and development.  Where the incentive isn't there because the government seems to be into just taxing the living shit out of drug makers. 
[03:18:00]  And all of that's going to get passed on to the consumer anyway.  So how is this going to bring down, like, drug prices?  Well, if you want to bring down drug prices, allow us to collectively bargain.  Allow us to say, you know what?  We would like to pay for your drugs what the United Kingdom and every other country in the world pays.  And we're the one, you just said, we're the one developing and researching these drugs here in America.  And yet they pay cheaper. 
[03:18:30]  They pay less.  Every American, again, not conservative liberal.  Every American would like to pay a lot less.  And if you can get them from Canada for the same exact drug, you'll pay less.  But someone's eating the cost overseas or someone's inflating the prices here.  Now, if the government's taxing the shit out of the drug makers, they're not going to say, well, I guess we're making less money on this.  Then they're going to charge an arm and a leg to the consumer. 
[03:19:00]  I'm not sure where the government is taxing the drug companies way more in this reform anyway.  But here's the thing.  You're describing what would have been a single payer Medicare for all.  What you're doing is what a lot of people do in being critical of this bill.  The fact is, it's not that.  It's much different.  It's not socialized.  It's not single payer.  It's none of that.  That's why people on the left hate this bill because it's a handout to private insurance, which they demonize. 
[03:19:30]  I should say we demonize.  I think private insurance is the dumbest thing in the world.  I think private for profit.  I'm okay with capitalism, but you don't make a profit off of prisons.  You don't make a profit off of health insurance.  You can make it off of health care, not insurance.  That's silly.  You don't need to.  There's no need to have a competition amongst insurance. 
[03:20:00]  Why?  You're not innovating, pushing paper.  Innovate hospitals.  Innovate treatment.  Innovate drugs.  Innovate all that.  You can't innovate insurance.  What can you do?  Come up with a better Excel spreadsheet for the doctor to file his claim, and you get it back quicker and get paid?  It's stupid.  There are certain things that you shouldn't be for profit.  You shouldn't incentivize a prison to say, if you fill up all those cells, then you'll get paid more.  Because then we'll have dumb laws to put people in prison for no reason.  But this goes further than just the insurance companies. 
[03:20:30]  It does delve into the health care aspect of it, not just the insurance.  It doesn't enough.  Republicans and Democrats agree that it doesn't bring down the cost of care.  It doesn't do a lot of things to reduce certain practices and techniques and too many MRIs being ordered.  And there's a lot of, you know, what's cool, Anthony, about our show is that I get so many doctors calling in saying,  they should do this.  They should do that.  And it's not even a heated argument. 
[03:21:00]  It's like, that's a good idea.  Republican Tom Coburn, I think, at that summit, the big summit.  He said, why don't we have, what is it called, private, fake, what's a, a cop who's on, undercover was what I was looking for.  Should hear me babble through trying to get to undercover on my show.  Wow.  Listen to my show where I babble to get to the word undercover.  He said, undercover patients and the patient can then say they're wasting on Medicare. 
[03:21:30]  They're doing this.  That's a Republican idea.  That's a brilliant idea.  That's a brilliant idea.  And Obama's going to do it.  And there's a lot of really cool, innovative ideas like that to bring down cost.  I think a good way would have been to bring in a lot of people that are experts in the fields.  All of them.  They did.  Medical and stuff.  Did they really listen?  They really did.  They brought in health care economists.  Yeah.  Really.  I brought one.  You guys know Aaron Carroll. 
[03:22:00]  He's been on a couple of times.  Doctors.  That guy comes on my show every week.  He's a health care economist.  He's also a pediatrician.  He's also a bore.  He's a bore.  He's a snooze.  I love him on our show because what we're talking about.  Yeah.  Well, let's take a few phone calls here.  Pete Dominic is a moron.  You want that one first?  Yes, please.  Go to the meanest one, obviously.  All right.  Let's go to James in Maryland.  James, we're talking to Pete Dominic.  Help me, Anthony.  Yeah.  Pete Dominic, you're a fucking moron.  I'm from Canada. 
[03:22:30]  My father was a doctor in Canada, OBGYN.  I once had to wait 12 hours in an emergency room in Guelph, Ontario, Canada, which is north of Toronto.  I've never had to wait in an emergency room.  When I go into an emergency room, they go, oh, hey, you're the guy.  Go ahead.  I've never had to wait here.  Let me ask you a question.  We thought about a broken hip.  Let me ask you.  We had to wait 12 hours.  Let me ask you.  There was one Dr. Pete on duty.  One for the city of Guelph. 
[03:23:00]  If you want to Google Guelph, there's a big university there.  I don't.  It's a big city of about 100,000 people.  I don't.  Well, I don't know how to spell Guelph.  Let me just ask you a question because you'll hear Canadians being critical of their – so why doesn't Canada – why doesn't Canada rise up and repeal their health care situation?  Because the most famous Canadian – you know, like the most famous American, like Abe Lincoln or George Washington or Martin Luther King?  Who's that guy in Canada?  Yeah.  That guy in Canada is a guy named Tommy Douglas, who is the premier of a Saskatchewan province. 
[03:23:30]  He's also – this will make it interesting – Kiefer Sutherland's grandfather.  He's the most – their favorite Canadian of all time.  He brought them their current system in 1968.  They love him.  Canadians, they're problems.  As this caller is saying, there's problems.  It's got problems.  Pete, Pete, do you know anything about Canada at all?  I've been to Nova Scotia.  Okay.  The only thing great from Canada right now is when we won the Olympic gold and we have great –  Boo!  Boo!  Boo! 
[03:24:00]  I don't know what to tell you.  This guy is not speaking for most Canadians.  Why not repeal what you have there then?  Why don't you elect someone to Canada to get rid of it?  Pete, there's a conservative right now.  He's a Republican.  His name is Stephen Harper.  He's kind of a Republican.  He's hated by Canadians.  Okay.  The biggest –  He's there, George Bush.  Okay.  The biggest province of Canada is Ontario.  Okay.  The guy there, he's kind of like an NDP socialist guy. 
[03:24:30]  There's more people that live in the province of Ontario than the whole country of Canada.  Okay.  The city of Toronto right now, there's about six to seven million.  The healthcare system is screwed.  You have people sitting there waiting in bed.  As opposed to ours, currently?  As opposed to ours, currently?  Detroit.  Burlington, Vermont.  Bangor, Maine.  Detroit, Michigan.  Pete, you're a frigging moron.  You don't have anything.  You know what you're doing.  Okay?  You don't have anything.  You know what you're doing. 
[03:25:00]  Well, first of all, that guy started with your moron and closed with your moron, but in between was fairly civil.  I appreciated him.  He tried to make some good points.  People really want to talk to Pete Dominick.  Hey, Joe, are you the one saying on this feedback, get to me?  No one that agrees with me, by the way.  Don't put anybody on that agrees with me.  Can you shut the fuck up, Pete Dominick?  Sorry.  Talking point three A.  Shove it up your fucking ass, number one.  All right?  How about we deal with the fucking illegal immigration fact, all right?  We got the largest illegal immigration of any industrialized society, okay? 
[03:25:30]  So why don't we deal with that fucking issue?  So now let's get to fucking the emergency room costs, okay?  So we deal with fucking the illegals and the fucking immigration costs, right?  Didn't you say that that was the highest cost for fucking medical care?  Okay?  And here's your counterpoint to your fucking point, you dumbass.  Let's collect the bargain fucking drug prices.  Let's collect the bargain.  Why don't we collect the bargain fucking medical insurance costs?  Why don't we spread it out?  Why don't we go state to state? 
[03:26:00]  Why don't we allow it?  Why don't we allow the free marketplace to fucking take place as it is?  Why don't we let that happen?  You want to know why?  You want to know why?  Yeah, I do.  Well, the state to state argument, like when I first...  They all have fucking money and they all fucking want to get paid.  And don't think about they're doing this for the common good because they're not.  Let me ask you.  What's his name?  Let Pete retort.  What's his name?  This is Joe in Vegas.  Hey, Joe, first of all, what's bothering you?  Like, aside from this, like, what are you angry about? 
[03:26:30]  Like, do you hit people ever or do you...  You sound very angry.  I hit your mother at night.  That's right.  You hit my mother.  That's...  First of all, it's our mother, so I don't appreciate my brother saying that, but...  By the way, Pete, this is a liberal tactic you're pulling all the time.  Oh, it's changing the subject?  I'm sorry.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a very passive-aggressive kind of degrade the caller.  Right.  So then that way you become superior to the caller, and then whatever you say is right...  I would argue as a comedian... 
[03:27:00]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I would argue as a comedian tactic trying to be funny.  I will go back to...  No, no, no, no.  Hold on.  I've seen many unfunny people say that.  But, Ed, as an observer...  Yes.  ...and watching you the first hour of this show, didn't you do just that to some of the  callers by stringing...  It wasn't passive-aggressive.  It was pure aggressiveness.  Stringing together an amazing selection of curse words in a row.  There was not one passive thing I said about that.  And this brings me to my point.  This is why this is all just horse shit in the end.  No one can work together. 
[03:27:30]  But you can if you...  No one can work together.  No.  Ed had his points earlier, and everyone's yelling and screaming at Anthony.  Now Dominic is making his points, and everyone's yelling and screaming at Dominic.  If you're making shit right now...  But if you have an actual...  Here's the thing.  If you have an actual discussion...  Yeah.  If you have an actual discussion...  And we try to forget talking points on both sides, but they're so...  Everybody's got their arguments created.  But like he said, let's just take...  He said the state to state.  Why not let the free market state to state?  Like to me, when I first heard that, I'm like, of course. 
[03:28:00]  That makes sense, right?  Of course it does.  But the thing is, the private health insurance industry...  Here's exactly what will happen if you do that.  They will pick the least healthy people and not cover them.  All the unhealthy people will not get covered.  Joe...  What do you know?  Because that's what...  Oh, no.  Because they already do it.  I mean, it's already in practice in California.  Because it's happened in California.  Because it's happened...  That's what the credit card companies do.  Swami. 
[03:28:30]  Credit card companies...  He called you Swami.  He did.  I'm sorry.  I love Swami.  Hold on.  Let me take off my hat.  I love Joe.  Do you have a camera?  Jesus.  Joe, because...  Not because I'm predicting it.  Because it already happens.  I can deal with common sense, okay?  Clearly you can.  I can deal with the big picture.  And the big picture is, let's get control.  Let's get control.  Let's get control.  And you know what next is coming?  It is coming to immigration.  Because that's the only way...  See, he's doing that now.  If you want to stay on health care, let's stay on health care.  You want to talk about immigration?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, let's wait until next week when I read. 
[03:29:00]  I have no idea.  Why don't you...  So, uh...  You're going to flip the page anymore.  Am I going to what?  Huh?  Am I going to what?  Flip the page.  You're going to flip the page.  You know, Potosha Boy 3A?  No.  I'd like to take another call.  You're not going to...  I mean, I tried to argue the state-to-state thing, but he called my mother a name or something.  All right, Joe.  Which is fine.  I mean, you know.  All right.  It's a little douchebag.  But that's what it...  That's the thing.  That's what it waters down to all the time.  It's like this name coming.  Like, I actually...  Here's my thing.  I love coming on the show and talking to Anthony. 
[03:29:30]  I come in and leave respecting the guy.  You know why?  Because he's engaged in it.  I'm sorry.  Just...  But you're engaged in it.  It doesn't matter if you're right or wrong.  As long as...  At least you and I are paying attention.  I like having a discussion and being informed, learning things even.  You know, there are certain things...  I'm not saying I know everything.  That's for shit sure.  So you're able to learn...  Me neither.  ...in a discussion.  I'm a comedian.  I'm not an expert on any of this stuff.  You know, I know a little bit about a lot of things.  A little.  Except for music and dance. 
[03:30:00]  You don't know anything about music?  What's wrong with you?  Don't bring it up.  Favorite band?  If you want to do a bit...  Favorite band?  I don't want to do this.  I don't want to do it?  If I do it, I'll get...  You too.  What's your favorite band?  You too.  Well, that's not a bad choice.  That's pretty bad.  It's not original, isn't it?  It's not original, but...  I'm going to give you a more original one.  Abba?  I like the samples.  You ever heard of them?  Okay.  If you haven't heard of them, I sound like I'm...  Nothing.  It's the band I was in in high school.  That's...  I don't know.  Are they right?  No, they're a band. 
[03:30:30]  Who else you got?  What are we doing?  Well, we got Ty in Indiana, but a lot of people pointing out that Pete Dominic sounds exactly  like Danny, so it's really fucking them up.  The voice?  Oh, really?  Have you heard that, really?  I don't think so.  A lot of people are saying that.  It's not slurring as much as Danny.  I try to hit consonants, none of them, on the radio, but I tend to.  It's early.  All right, Ty in Indiana.  We're running out of time with Pete Dominic.  All right, good morning, mother.  Good morning.  Hey, first of all, Pete, Ant's health care is so good, it covered his fucking surgical 
[03:31:00]  hair replacement.  It did not.  Shut up.  And I got follicles individually put in the direction that the hair grows, and it was from  the harvest area.  Well, first of all, they should never cover cosmetic anything.  Insurance shouldn't.  They should only be able to get that if you're rich.  Shut up.  All right.  I'm sorry.  Would you get plugs, Pete Dominic?  No.  I feel like I'm off on the wrong foot.  I've got so much material in my ass about being bald.  That would just fuck up your ass.  But I just, yeah, I mean, what are you going to do? 
[03:31:30]  Well, that's the most handsome strong men are.  Hey, I've got two kids and a fucking wife and me, and the company I work for, I can't  afford 900 bucks to insure my family, you know, which is what come out of my check.  That's like a fucking mortgage payment.  What's this Obamacare going to do for my ass?  Well, how much money do you make?  Around 40.  Yeah, you should be, this is really to help.  I live in fucking middle Indiana, which that's doing all right, believe it or not.  This should help you.  You'll probably qualify for subsidies, and you'll be able to afford health care. 
[03:32:00]  I mean, I was making at one point, doing just stand-up, $80,000, and I had two kids and  a wife who was working a little bit, and my health insurance premiums, because I, you  know, I'm a comedian, there's no union, I would argue I was working as hard as anybody  who wasn't doing manual labor and working outside, and my health care was 13 grand  a year.  Now, I afforded it because I'm responsible, and I paid for it, but I couldn't save up  for a house, I couldn't afford a car, I couldn't afford a lot of, you know, normal 
[03:32:30]  stuff.  Now, you know, then I started working at Sirius, and got health care, and now I can  buy organic berries.  But, I mean, the truth is, there's a lot of people out there that freelance.  Yeah, if you're a freelancer, you're a really good help.  If you're a freelancer, you're fucked, because you've got to get your own insurance, and  it's a nightmare.  If you're a fiscal conservative, and you want to promote entrepreneurship, and be able  to start, you know, one of the things here is, people get locked in jobs, and they only  stay in their awful job because of the health insurance.  They have skills that they would love to start this business. 
[03:33:00]  I heard this on CNN last night.  I heard this.  Did Wolf say this already?  I steal all my talking points from Wolf now.  But, I mean, don't you want to encourage people to pursue their dreams or whatever, especially  if they have, like, money to open a business?  But they can't do it because they can't cover, and only an irresponsible parent would take  a risk.  Well, and hopefully, let me tell you something.  Hopefully, that entrepreneurial spirit.  No, again.  No, again. 
[03:33:30]  Entrepreneurial spirit will let somebody grow their business and achieve the American dream  so they, too, can get the fuck taxed out of them and have to stop hiring people, like  I have, by the way.  I've had to stop hiring certain people.  Yes.  Come on.  Because of my fucking taxes.  They're too high.  I am over 60% now, when you take everything into consideration. 
[03:34:00]  I am paying more to my government than I am getting myself for, already, by the way, already.  But for some reason, that's still not going to be enough.  And I have to be taxed more.  And you know what?  I don't pay enough, according to, you know, a lot of the people that fucking don't know  me from a hole in the wall.  Well, I don't know what your personal situation is, and I want to get a violin out for you.  See?  Exactly.  But that's what a lot of people say.  But here's the thing.  Good.  Good chastised.  I hope everyone in this country can make it so they can see that you will all of a sudden 
[03:34:30]  become the beast of burden for everybody that hasn't made it.  Wow.  You have really victimized yourself with the beast of burden phrase.  Yeah, that's it.  It's on my fucking back.  My fucking back.  Listen, I understand.  You know what?  I don't think that you're wrong.  I don't think that there's anything wrong with that complaint, that you're too taxed.  But, you know, things don't come for free.  Taxes...  For free.  There can only be such mismanagement of funds to fuck up the amount of taxes that are paid 
[03:35:00]  in this country.  Well, why don't you get a pilot's license and fly it into the IRS building?  Uh, that's been done.  All right.  You want to be original.  I like...  What are you going to do?  Doing something original.  What will your terrorist act be?  Because you're an original guy.  I don't...  He doesn't want to play his cards on that one.  I think I'll just, like, burn illegal movies and watch them.  Yeah.  Like, that's...  I'm thinking, like, you're setting fire to movies. 
[03:35:30]  I'm like, why would you do that?  No, no, that would be dangerous.  I'm just talking burn him off the computer and then watch him and chuckle.  Here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  If you're 50 years old and you've been working in a steel plant your whole life and providing  for your family and you just lost your job because the steel plant moved to China, you  shouldn't be penalized.  You can't afford health insurance for your family.  No one worked harder than that guy and he's getting shafted.  And this will change that.  This will change for the hardest working Americans.  Everybody thinks this is for poor blacks. 
[03:36:00]  It's not.  This is for hard-working whites, blacks, and everything in between.  We already have health care for poor people.  It's called Medicaid.  This is going to help the people like that color who fell through the cracks, who are  working their asses off, liberal or conservative, making $45,000, $50,000, $60,000 a year.  They're ages 40 through 55.  They've been working their whole life doing everything fucking right and their kids now  are getting fucked and their dad has to come home and say, I'm sorry, not only can I not  afford your college, you can't go to the doctor because I lost my job at the plant, which 
[03:36:30]  I've had for 20 years.  That's not right.  It's not right.  Ha ha.  See, if you would never say that to the steel plant guy's face because he put you in a  molten lava.  That sounds very noble and I hope it works out.  But that's what it is.  And you might not get your pool cover.  Let's all say I got a great pool cover.  You can put an elephant on it and it's not supposed to rip.  That's wonderful.  So with that, Jeff from Hoboken, it says here he wants to attempt a conversation with 
[03:37:00]  this clown.  Hey, Danny, you're actually a great dancer.  You keep dancing around the truth.  Danny.  Well, it's Pete Dominick.  Some people say he sounds like Danny, but it's Pete Dominick who does a show here at  SiriusXM on POTUS and he's going to be on CNN.  Tell me the truth.  Do you want a regular thing on John King's CNN show?  I mean, honestly, I don't understand most of what's in the whole health package.  But I don't think you know what you're talking about as far as Canada goes.  I've driven through the whole country. 
[03:37:30]  Oh, well then.  I'm an American.  This is one of the dumbest people I've ever talked to on my show or on his show.  This guy says because he drove across Canada, he actually knows what people think about an  issue because he drove across.  You have to stop and talk.  Well, why don't you look at the studies done on Canadians?  Maybe he hit people and then saw what their health care was. 
[03:38:00]  If you went to Canada and got hurt, the fact is, look at my ass finger.  See this finger that looks like an ass?  I was in Canada when this happened.  They took care of me.  You're a liberal talkover.  That's what you do.  You're a talkover.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead and tell me about what you learned driving across Canada, you douchebag.  What other countries did you take a field trip in and decide what their problems are?  Well, on my show, by the way, I would never do this. 
[03:38:30]  I'd rather go to hang myself.  But I don't get to call people names on my show.  So listen, stupid.  Where else have you gone on a field trip?  Is this what you do at home?  You go to the mirror and you say, hey, stupid.  No, I build myself up in the mirror and say, you can have hair.  No, not on my show.  Only on this one because you're that dumb.  I am not tough.  I am not tough.  That's a misnomer.  No, I'm not tough.  If you and I wrestled or tickled each other. 
[03:39:00]  Okay, go ahead.  All right.  Canada's a mess.  Additionally, what happens to the road?  The road says there's potholes.  He knows.  He knows from his field trip.  The potholes, the signs are wrong sometimes.  Additionally, what happens when we stop subsidizing all the health care on the planet?  Our overpaying has paid for the drugs, has paid for the equipment, has paid for everything that everybody else...  This bill gets rid of that waste in Medicare.  It fixes that.  But you don't know because you said you don't pay attention. 
[03:39:30]  That's okay.  It's okay that you don't.  And I'm telling you that it helps that.  Explain it.  Don't make your blanket statements and then talk over somebody.  Explain it since you're a genius.  Explain how it cuts Medicare, the waste in Medicare.  When a country like Denmark has health care, and they have these fabulous drugs and equipment,  who do you think pays for that?  Their cheapo health care that costs nothing to the people?  We pay for... 
[03:40:00]  We pay for Denmark's MRI machines?  We pay for...  No, they bought them from our capitalist, innovative technology companies.  Stop it, Mr. Liberal.  All right.  Talking over people.  We pay for the research and development.  Now, did you go hiking in Denmark and stay in a hostel in 2001?  Tell me about your trip to Denmark.  The country with the happiest people.  When did you go there with your backpack?  You're a bad comedian and a bad arguer.  Well, those are both accurate.  Talk over people. 
[03:40:30]  You're a bore.  A bore and you're stupid.  Well, he's got the phones lit, so I don't know if he's a bore.  The show is Stand Up with Pete Dominick.  Yeah.  It's on POTUS, three to six.  Boring.  Your show is a bore.  You're a bore.  You've got nothing to say.  Have you ever listened to my show?  Have you listened to the show?  It's your boring show in St. God, there are 200 other stations.  Yeah, you know, you should check out...  Why don't you try and have a conversation instead of talking over people like that woman in Congress last night?  That woman.  I actually...  Just to be fair, I actually... 
[03:41:00]  If it was my show, I would have...  I'm unleashing on people on here.  On my show, people get to talk as much as they want.  All right.  You sound like that boring guy from Canada who says, Google it, Google it, Google it.  He's saying boring.  Google yourself and find stupid, boring, and retarded.  Should I Google Pete Dominick, stupid, boring, and retarded together with quotation marks?  You'll find...  You know what will come up?  Your Facebook page, dummy.  You know what?  You're a bore.  You know what's not a bore? 
[03:41:30]  My conversation with you.  This is the most exciting thing that will happen in my radio career.  Right here.  What do you think will happen is when you walk down and a bus hits you, and the bus will go,  what was that boring lump?  What did you say?  What was that?  Boring lump?  A boring lump.  When you pull down your pants, a woman goes, what's that boring lump?  Jesus Christ.  Oh, God damn.  I'll give you another chance.  I'll give you another chance.  I'll have a conversation.  Drop the liberal talk over. 
[03:42:00]  Do you know anything?  Where'd you go to college first off?  University of Phoenix Online.  Is that a joke?  No, I went two years.  I had a football scholarship.  Football scholarship.  That was funny.  But who would go there but a dummy bore?  That was fucking funny.  Jesus, you're making progress, bore.  By the way, check out my...  All right, Jeff.  We've got to let you go, because we're...  Oh, my God.  Ant's got to get to a doctor's appointment.  We've got other people calling.  I actually have a doctor's appointment.  Do you really?  What is it?  Can you tell us what it is?  Ant's got to get out of here.  What are you doing? 
[03:42:30]  Oh, no, I'm starting a vigorous workout regimen.  So you're just getting everything checked out.  So I go for a check out.  Well, I was a personal trainer for seven years.  I have a personal trainer.  What's your vigorous workout regimen?  Vigorous workout regimen is going to be ridiculous amounts of cardio and then, you know, a couple  of days of weights.  Do you have any issues?  I mean, why are you doing that?  You look like you're in shape, but people always say that to me, too.  I couldn't run my head off.  I'm a little like, you know, I'm a little doughy down here.  I was working out like a year ago and really got into good shape, and then I let it go. 
[03:43:00]  And then it's been like two years since I've had a check out.  Is it what kind of a personal trainer is it?  Some of these guys.  A big muscle head that if I say no, he's going to literally bodily throw me into the gym.  And when are you going to work out?  Because you've got this every morning.  You're going to have enough energy to go and do that every day?  Here's what I used to do.  I'd get off here.  I'd fucking leave.  The second we're done, out the door, go home, nap a couple hours, wake up, go to the gym.  Yeah, that's tough.  Are you going to be able to do that? 
[03:43:30]  I did it about a year ago.  I'd get up and say, I'm a couple of years.  We're lucky.  We don't have to work as many hours.  Or as hard.  We just don't do anything.  I have 19 jobs.  You could fit in a workout.  Look, Pete, you're going to have to come back because the phones are just fucking lit.  People agreeing with you.  People want to fucking rip your head off.  This is great.  Well, I love the show.  I love you guys.  I'll come on any time.  It's the Opie and Anthony President's Day special.  Sam, after the break, Jesse Ventura returns and may never be back again. 
[03:44:00]  The great former governor of Minnesota, former pro wrestler, awesome color analyst, Jesse Ventura,  back on the Opie and Anthony show.  And yes, he almost disemboweled Jim Norton.  Yeah, it got pretty heated.  And this was the first time.  We always suspected it might end badly every time he's here, and it never does.  But this one happened to be so.  Stay tuned.  More of Opie and Anthony's President's Day special coming up on the virus.  The Opie and Anthony President's Day special continues on the virus.  Here are your hosts, Sam and E-Rock. 
[03:44:30]  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's President's Day, so we're going to do this political special.  Oh, actually, we've been doing this political special that you've been listening to.  I'm E-Rock.  He's primetime Sam Roberts.  Sam in studio.  One of our favorite guests.  This is probably his last appearance.  And one of your heroes, Jesse Ventura.  Well, I wouldn't count your chickens before they're hatched.  This was a great appearance by Jesse Ventura, as it always is.  Of course I look up to him.  He's an ex-professional wrestler.  So let me guess, does it turn into a heated debate? 
[03:45:00]  It does, as it usually does, when Jesse Ventura stops by.  However, for the first time this one ends and Jesse actually walking off the show,  we were able to garner a lot of publicity from this.  TMZ picked up the video.  Huffington Post picked up the video.  FARC.  Yeah, it was amazing.  You and Steve did such a great job with that video.  See, that's the thing.  Steve had nothing to do with it.  Really?  Yeah, really.  That's not what he told everyone around here.  Yeah, I know.  He tells people things, but I am responsible for getting the video on all the websites.  The secret's out. 
[03:45:30]  You sure?  I'm positive.  I know because I did it.  Hmm.  Okay.  Yeah, I know.  It's not even debatable.  And I wish somebody would try.  Regardless, Jesse Ventura almost kicks the crap out of Jim Norton and walks off the show.  Now, if you want to follow along with this, go to opradio.com, which takes you to opradio on YouTube or opradio on Twitter.  You can see a bunch of different videos from this segment.  Yes, opradio on Twitter and YouTube has all the different parts from what you're about to hear.  Jesse Ventura flipping out again on the Worst of the Week countdown. 
[03:46:00]  Including the video that Steve and Sam made.  Steve had nothing to do with it.  There's no foundry watermark on it.  There's your evidence.  This is the O.P. and Anthony President's Day special.  What have you proven about the Hells Angels?  I mean, come on.  You're right.  The Hells Angels.  They're a motorcycle gang.  They've done some bad stuff.  But to actually mention them in a discussion about what they're trying to do.  Well, what I'm saying to you, I'm making the comparison.  Listen, here you have an organization that's involved in crime.  Yes, mafia, Irish mafia.  All of them.  Sure, absolutely.  And so should we treat them the same way? 
[03:46:30]  Because sometimes people die around them for no reason.  They kill people.  You're going to tell me that they've never killed anybody?  But they're not hijacking commercial airliners and flying them into buildings.  But they might if it served their purpose, wouldn't they?  I don't know.  They might do it then.  I don't know.  Maybe they would.  Maybe they would.  You know?  What does that prove?  And if they did, and if they did...  Well, what it proves is you have to treat everyone the same under the law.  You can't simply say, okay, the law applies to you, but it doesn't apply to you. 
[03:47:00]  Because who plays that God figure that makes that decision?  Who do you allow to be able to make that decision?  You're not wrong, but the decision of...  The way the legal system is, you know how it is.  The way the legal...  So you think that we should just allow these guys...  Like, we saw what happened with the Zacharias Moussaoui trial.  It's a fucking circus.  And so we're going to allow these guys just to language...  So you're saying that they don't deserve a trial?  Not saying that.  That our government just says, you're guilty, and we're going to execute you or do what we do.  No trial.  You're putting words in my mouth. 
[03:47:30]  I'm not saying that.  Well, I'm asking...  No, I'm not saying that.  Well, then when do you have a trial?  When do you allow our rules of law to...  Is it only for our citizens?  It's hard to...  Honestly, in this situation, I don't know because we've never faced this type of an enemy before.  Then why...  This country has never faced this before.  Why wouldn't you take POWs from any war we've ever been in and bring them over and try each  and every one for murder of U.S. citizens?  Because they represent a country.  All right, we're in a different situation. 
[03:48:00]  These people don't represent a country.  Bin Laden didn't even represent the Taliban.  Wait, we're back to the Hells Angels.  They don't represent a country.  They're like a gang.  Yeah, they're a gang within the United States.  They're American citizens.  Well, what difference does that make?  The difference is...  Our laws apply.  You don't have to be a citizen to have our laws.  Otherwise, what would we do to tourists?  When we're at war with somebody, the rules are treated, are different.  You know that.  The rules of engagement are different. 
[03:48:30]  For military.  Yes.  And you don't think Khalid Sheikh Mohammed should be held under military rules?  Boy, that is quite the loophole, then, that people could not come over and invade our country.  He should be tried for murder because he's a civilian who killed civilians.  He should be tried the same way Manson was.  Al-Qaeda is operating as a military operator.  It's a different enemy.  I mean, the U.S. has never seen an enemy that operated like this.  What a great loophole.  Let's get a bunch of people from Somalia or from Afghanistan, load up a ship, come over to the U.S., not as an army, not as a representing a country. 
[03:49:00]  Did that happen?  No, let me just put this as a hypothetical example.  Now, let him just sweep on in and try to take over the United States with a little army.  And now, instead of treating them as military combatants, we have to try each and every one of them as a criminal with the same rules and regulations?  No, I would say you don't give them any rights.  You simply take them out back and execute them like the Wild West. 
[03:49:30]  That's silly.  No, that's what you're telling me.  No, he's not.  You're telling me there's now a loophole for invading our country?  No, he's not.  Who's invaded our country?  I'm saying there's a loophole now, the way you put it.  If some entity wants to invade the United States, they can now do it without the repercussions of not having due process.  They will then have due process?  The same things that we're afforded?  No.  Yeah, not in our country. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah, it's crazy.  Absolutely.  I agree with you.  You would allow...  By God, take them out back and hang them.  No, we should do it.  Because you know that you're not going to be a victim of terrorism.  So what we should do is just allow citizens to be slaughtered while we...  We're not allowing anything.  It's called great police work.  No, no, no.  Don't violate those civil liberties.  Do not violate civil liberties.  Yeah, absolutely.  Do not profile.  Do not investigate Muslims because they're Muslim because that's a profiling.  And everybody on the left goes ballistic when you profile because that's not a 40 citizens' due process.  You're profiling them. 
[03:50:30]  You judge them guilty before they were tried.  So you can't do that.  Well, let's not leave it there either.  We're also profiling the Mexicans.  We should profile...  We profile the Italians for the mafia.  You profile bikers for...  Profiling works to a certain degree as long as citizens are afforded a certain amount of respect.  And I like the fact that now we don't even do it at the borders.  Where are Mexicans being profiled?  Well, I drive across every year.  And now the last time I drove across the border, I showed my passport at the border.  And I was two hours into Arizona on the freeway. 
[03:51:00]  And I had to do a two-hour stop there because the cars were backed up.  Because it was an immigration stop in the middle of Arizona.  Not at the border.  But that seems logical for the people that got across.  Well, it only...  You DWI checkpoints.  Gee, it only goes against our Constitution, but what the hell?  DWI checkpoints do it too, technically.  No.  Our Constitution says you can travel freely inside the United States.  So DWI checkpoints also?  No, no, no, no. 
[03:51:30]  Why?  Because that's driving a car and a license and you're dealing with a cop.  Same thing here.  No, it isn't the same.  This is immigration.  So what?  You're checking to see if...  So what?  You're a citizen.  You're not being hassled if you're a citizen.  Yes, you are.  You're asked to produce.  I already did it at the border.  Same as DWI checkpoint.  You're asked to prove your sobriety.  No, it's different.  It's not different.  Yes, it is.  It's different because it doesn't prove your point, but it's not different.  Because driving is a privilege.  Yes, they weren't stopping citizens walking.  No, driving is a privilege.  You don't have a right to drive. 
[03:52:00]  It's a privilege.  But you have a right to be a citizen.  It's your right not to be questioned inside the United States if you're a citizen.  Don't the police have a right to ask you...  This isn't the police.  This isn't the police.  You're talking about the Border Patrol.  This is immigration.  Immigration.  Oh, okay.  So what right does immigration have to pull me over in the middle of Arizona and ask me  to produce papers that I'm a citizen?  That seems a little shifting.  Yeah, but they were stopping people because they wanted to make sure that they weren't  illegals. 
[03:52:30]  They weren't looking for you.  So what if they ask you to produce?  And I mean that.  I refused.  Of course you did.  Because you're a recognizable guy.  Because I believe in the Constitution.  So do I.  But again, it's not a suicide...  No, you don't because you're saying that this is okay.  You're right.  I don't believe in the Constitution.  Stop it.  Stop it.  I don't believe in the Constitution.  You're violating it.  No, I'm not.  I'm exercising my free speech.  Boo-hoo.  Oh, Jesus.  And time.  Wow.  I love the Constitution.  It troubles me because...  I don't like the perverse use of the Constitution.  We're out in the middle in the United States and you're asked to produce your citizenship 
[03:53:00]  when you've already done it at the border.  And our country has never made us have to produce any type of thing like that just to freely travel  about the country.  Where are your papers?  Do you have to produce your...  Where are your papers?  Can you leave Minnesota into South Dakota?  And I foresee in the future they're going to have...  State to state, you think?  State to state where you're going to have to produce paperwork to go from one state to  the next.  It's called easy pass now.  And that's called taking away your freedoms in light of keeping us safe. 
[03:53:30]  Slippery.  That's what you'd say to the police doing on a police work.  Let's keep us safe.  That's what you'd say about the police doing on a police work.  Don't put word on a police work.  That ain't police work.  That's immigration.  But if it was the cop...  Say the cop had done it.  No, no, no.  It ain't a cop.  You said it's all police work to stop terrorists.  A cop can pull you over.  So if they started questioning people in a mosque, you'd say, oh, that's racist.  A cop can pull you over.  Don't put words in my mouth, please.  I'm lying.  You've done it to me.  You did it to me.  Bye, Jess. 
[03:54:00]  Governor.  You always just sulk and walk away.  Why?  You put words in my mouth.  There's a fucking guy here telling me I got a schedule.  You're using dirty language, asshole.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  Bye, tough guy.  Bye, tough guy.  And thanks for your service to our country.  You're welcome.  Thanks for touching me with your fucking stupid riffraff fucking Rocky Horror hairdo.  You're bigger than me and stronger than me.  So what?  I don't give a shit.  You want to beat me up?  Go ahead. 
[03:54:30]  I'm not going to fight a guy like you.  That means nothing to me.  I know.  I argued with you.  You put words in my mouth and you didn't like when I did it to you.  You put words in my mouth saying I didn't believe in the Constitution and that's bullshit.  It's not true.  I don't agree with abusing it.  Thank you for your service.  Oh, you're welcome.  You're a bigger patriot than me.  Godspeed.  Fuck out of here.  Wow.  What happened? 
[03:55:00]  He's a fucking baby.  What happened?  That ended on a fucking baby.  A nice note.  Who gives a shit?  A big fucking guy that doesn't like the little guy yelling.  You scared him, Jimmy.  You scared him away.  No, here's what that is.  He wanted to knock my fucking block off, but he knows that he shouldn't or he can't because  of the law or all this stuff.  Fuck you.  I don't care because I fucking hate that shit.  What happened, Sam?  I really do.  Don't fight.  I bow to you.  I would never. 
[03:55:30]  So do I.  I would never.  I saw the look Jesse was giving you.  I don't care.  I would never try to challenge a guy like that physically, and I don't posture that  way.  He would murder me.  You're like fucking Spider.  You were just like Spider.  I want to toss your money.  I would never talk tough guy talk.  I was arguing an ideological point.  I would never get in Jesse Ventura's face and think I'm going to outman him.  That was not my point, and I've never done that.  Don't fucking tough guy me.  I hate that.  He was tough guy.  Fuck him.  I don't care how strong he is.  I hate that.  You are. 
[03:56:00]  Bravo to Jim.  That drives me nuts, man.  That's my fucking pet peeve.  I hate it.  Suicide by wrestler was what he was trying.  Holy shit.  Suicide by wrestler.  But it's not a tough guy thing.  The guy would just.  It's not about that.  I'm not going to fight Jesse Ventura.  I just.  I can't be bullied.  It makes me fuck.  Fuck you.  I hate it.  How'd you feel when he tapped your shoulder?  Annoyed.  Not intimidated.  Annoyed.  Annoyed.  Thank you for your service.  He didn't do it hard.  It wasn't a threatening.  But it was.  Don't try to alpha male me, stupid. 
[03:56:30]  Danny just picked up a picture of the Crypt Keeper.  Danny's real brave.  Jimmy's the only one that opened his mouth like a man.  I fucking.  Dude.  Like a man.  That drives me crazy.  That was a great ending.  That drives me nuts.  Wow.  What is he saying down the hall there?  Who cares?  Who cares?  I'm just curious.  I asked him if when his book comes out in April he'd be happy to come back because despite  the tumult, that really sounded well.  He goes, nope.  Not doing it.  Good.  Fuck you.  Bye.  Don't.  We're done with him? 
[03:57:00]  Don't.  We've had intense discussions with the guy.  I walked with him into the elevator and I said, Governor, I know that your feelings may  have gotten hurt and you don't like Jim.  Who cares?  I don't like him either.  He's a sulker.  I don't respect that little shit.  I don't respect him either.  I respect his military service, but I think he's a fucking, I don't respect him in a debate  because he's a baby who pushes his microphone.  Aww.  What's the matter?  You're not used to being challenged by a small guy, you fucking big dumb wrestler? 
[03:57:30]  I fucking hate that shit.  I mean.  By the way.  I never, but it's not like I stood up and go, what?  I would never do that, dude.  People are saying best ending ever.  By the way, yes, we did get that on video and boy will that video be on.  I don't give a shit if he comes back.  That's a big one.  I don't care.  That's a biggie right there.  That's a big one.  I don't, I swear to God, I don't care if he comes back.  Wait till you see Jesse's face on that video.  Honest to God, he wanted to strangle you.  Too bad.  I know.  Then don't argue with me on the radio.  Just bully me in an alley like you probably would have if you weren't a dumb fucking wrestler. 
[03:58:00]  I fucking hate big guys.  I'm afraid of Jimmy being more funny.  Dude, I really, I hate that shit.  I fucking hate that shit.  Dude, you, you, bravo.  I mean, there's nothing.  I hate it.  Honestly, there's nothing I can say, the listeners can say, Anthony can say.  It's a bravo all the way around, so trust me.  I would never have tried to speak that way to Jesse.  Me and I saw the look that Jesse gave you.  Bravo.  Wait till you see this fucking video.  You fucking nose to nose and just, you did not back down an iota.  But stay, no, I won't back down. 
[03:58:30]  I know, that's just it.  But again, if it came down to a real fight, the acknowledgement is, the guy's going to  murder me.  I'm not going to fight Jesse, man.  It's not about that.  It's an argument.  Even if it was a small guy or a woman I was arguing with, which is what I am to him.  It was that whole push the mic away, yeah, yeah, nothing.  Don't try to fucking alpha-mail me in an argument.  That's what he was doing.  We had a really good discussion with the guy, too.  Why did it have to end there?  Because he's a guy like...  You know what?  I'll tell you why.  I started fading out.  I'll be completely honest.  What got to him at the end there?  I didn't like when he goes, well, you don't like the Constitution. 
[03:59:00]  He doesn't like me because I don't agree with him.  And I'm fucking...  Don't put fucking words in my mouth.  He put fucking words in my mouth.  And then he called me an asshole, and I called him an asshole.  And when Jimmy called him out on putting words in his mouth, he had no defense for it.  Because that's what he is.  He's one of those big bully motherfuckers who likes to use his size and his weight, and  he talks over everybody, and he's not a dumb guy.  I'm not going to say, so what?  Fuck him.  He's not a dumb guy.  He's not a dumb guy.  I just want to see Jimmy look.  I just disagree with him.  Don't turn around, Jimmy.  Don't turn around.  I respect the guy's military service.  I respect the guy.  He's a bright dude.  He's not a dumb guy. 
[03:59:30]  He's just more radical than I am.  But that, when you're arguing, and that disagreeing, that fucking, like, that's all of a sudden  the atomic bomb.  I'm going to use my...  Fuck you, man.  You know what you should do?  Bend him over and humble him.  You fuck in the ass.  I fuck you in the ass and humble you.  I don't care if he...  That little shit.  That's what I think of you, you big fat motherfucker.  Beat it.  Steve.  There was a point...  No, I'm sorry.  Anthony, there was a point when Jimmy turned all the way around.  Jesse was at the doorway.  Jesse was debating...  I'm coming back in.  So what? 
[04:00:00]  Yeah, he was.  No, I'm just saying.  I know he was.  I'm just painting the picture for everyone.  There was a moment there where Jesse's like, I think I've got to go back in there and hit  this guy.  I was scared for you.  And then, at the last second, turned and walked away.  Because when he drank his water and finished the bottle, I thought he was going to throw  the bottle in his face.  And I would have thrown mine at him and got the shit beat out of me.  Believe me.  Oh my God, that's what I was thinking.  That's why I started getting afraid.  And then Kenny would have had to come in and, oh, it would have been awful.  Kenny, I want to talk to Kenny for a minute.  I want to know what Kenny was thinking.  I've been boxing lately.  I would have tried something. 
[04:00:30]  Would you knock it off?  Dude, I would be annoyed at a small guy for pushing the microwave during an argument when  Jesse was having a lot of time to say what he had to say.  We were arguing back and forth.  He felt I put words in his mouth.  I felt he put words in mine.  But then to drop it like that, goodbye.  I know.  Fuck you.  We're promoting your show for the last 20 minutes.  Ask plenty of legitimate questions.  Yes.  Let him get his point across over and over again.  It drives me crazy.  Kenny, where would have been that fail-safe point where you had to jump in? 
[04:01:00]  Because you held off.  You didn't do anything.  You didn't get in between anybody.  What were you thinking during that whole thing?  I was keeping my eye on him.  Yeah?  Now, what would you think if you had to go against Jesse Ventura?  Bye, Jim.  Ronnie B's in studio.  We almost lost Jimmy today, Ronnie.  I swear to God, true story.  I'm downstairs and saw Ventura go through the turnstiles twice.  He just kept fucking making it up.  He just kept walking around and pushing it. 
[04:01:30]  I guess he was pushing it so hard he didn't realize how to get out the other side.  He was angry.  I fucking hate bullies.  Jimmy, you didn't serve.  Jesus Christ.  You know what?  In that argument, that drives me nuts, too, because I'm not one of these.  I have nothing but respect for the military.  And I've said it 50 times.  Pull them out of everywhere.  Fuck the rest of the world.  Don't get our guys killed for fucking North Korea or anybody.  Fuck all of them.  It makes me sick.  It was amazing, Ronnie.  Holy shit. 
[04:02:00]  He did that last time.  The look that Jesse gave.  The look that Jimmy gave.  That's a pretty good impression.  There was some crazy look going on.  Wow.  Well, I guess everyone's going to tune into his show tonight.  Hey, watch the show.  It's probably a good show.  As long as you don't watch it Thursday through Sunday when I'm at Caroline's.  I don't care what you do.  And the video was angry.  The video of the confrontation later on this afternoon.  You've got to see this one.  Holy shit.  I saw it live.  I had to turn my head at one point.  I was scared. 
[04:02:30]  I did not want to see you get hit.  Not that I didn't want to see it happen.  I literally did not want to see it.  So I turned away thinking you absolutely were going to get fucking clocked.  It was intense, too, because Sam's on the video.  And I go whispering to Sam, get closer, get closer.  And Sam's like, no, fuck no.  Oh, you got a fucking close-up of him?  He's got a zoom lens open.  Look at the look.  Show Ronnie B the look.  The good thing, though, is if you would have got a hit, it would have been a fake hit.  Where they hit their clock.  Yeah.  And then if you needed to, you could just start going like this until the audience got 
[04:03:00]  behind you.  We'd all start clapping.  Yeah, yeah.  Hold some signs up.  Oh, jeez.  You see that look?  Let me see your look.  That stupid hairdo.  Jimmy, everyone's saying bravo.  Simple as that.  It's not even that.  Oh, I know.  But you know what?  I would never come at the guy physically.  You know what?  You stood up for a lot of people out there that have been in that situation with a big,  tough guy.  And you know what?  You fucking stood right in there with the guy.  Because I would never yell at a guy who weighed 100 pounds.  That's why people are saying bravo today.  Like, I would never.  I don't bully people who are smaller than me.  Because most people in your situation walk away.  Trust me.  They just do. 
[04:03:30]  You have no choice and you walk away.  Bully stalker Patty.  I'm always nice to stalker Patty.  That was a pussy.  I gave her an orgasm.  He'll defend himself.  That was amazing.  I love Patty.  That was amazing.  I love her.  I love her.  I love the girl.  She's fantastic.  All right.  We've got to go home, man.  More of Opie and Anthony's President's Day special coming up on The Virus. </pre>
