<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts’ characteristic irreverent style, punctuated by profanity, as they reacted to the London bombings.  A rapid-fire sequence of negative news headlines set the tone, followed by commentary on the perceived sensationalism and inconsistencies in news reporting across various channels.  They criticized dramatic music choices and the perceived prioritization of less important stories over breaking news. The discussion touched on racial dynamics in America, particularly post-9/11, and the fleeting media attention given to events like shark attacks and Natalee Holloway's disappearance. A recurring joke about a "chaos on the runway" news story remained unresolved.  Listener calls provided anecdotal reactions to news coverage, including a ridiculous story about backward bowling and a caller's sister's fear of news reports. A Canadian caller repeatedly joked about wanting a US invasion of Canada.  Jim Norton was mentioned as a regular co-host, but was not present.

The show then transitioned to a discussion about remembering jokes during live broadcasts, leading into a comparison of Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg's responses to the London bombings.  Giuliani's perceived strength was contrasted with Bloomberg's perceived weakness, with Giuliani's reported use of a Churchill biography for inspiration being mocked. A caller correctly guessed a joke the hosts had forgotten.  A significant portion detailed Anthony's protracted and frustrating ordeal with Dell's customer service, highlighting his difficulties getting replacement computer fans.  This fueled a broader discussion on deteriorating customer service, including anecdotes about Citibank and EasyPass, with Anthony expressing considerable agitation.  The segment included listener calls, audio clips from various sources (including Giuliani, Leno, and Anthony's bedroom), and a discussion about the movie *Snatch*.  The segment ended with a lengthy rant about Dell and a series of "Fuck You" calls. Patrice, Keith Robinson, Carlos Messia, and Richard Huff were mentioned as scheduled guests, Dee Dee as a possibly absent news reporter, and Jim's sleep habits on the road were shared.

The next segment featured more listener calls detailing frustrating customer service experiences with XM Satellite Radio, cell phone providers, and Dell. Opie shared his own XM activation issues.  The conversation shifted to Bruce Kelly, an XM broadcaster who emotionally broke down on air while covering The Who at Live 8.  Audio clips of Kelly crying were played, mocked extensively, and incorporated into comedic bits.  This was contrasted with the stoicism of a London commuter discussing the bombings. A caller from Howard Beach recounted negative experiences with Dell and threatened his neighbors with his broken laptop.  This led to a discussion of race relations in America, with guest Patrice O’Neal providing commentary filled with racial slurs and offensive generalizations.  O’Neal discussed the disproportionate media attention given to missing white children versus missing black children. The hosts and O'Neal discussed a video of a fight between a black man harassing a white couple, where the white man knocked out the harasser with a martial arts move, leading to further discussion of race, violence, and unexpected reactions. They also discussed websites with violent and disturbing videos. A caller provided information about one such site.  The show concluded this segment with a discussion of a tasteless WWE storyline involving a terrorist character.  Patrice O’Neal was a guest.

The show continued with a comedian recounting his firing from a corporate event for Michael Dell's money managers due to a perceived lack of commitment to their "cause." He described the event, mentioning Steve Austin and The Rock's appearances and Vince McMahon's control. A street fight video prompted a lengthy and racially charged discussion about the ethnicity of the participants, with terms like "white black guy" and "skinhead" used.  The second major topic was Rick Delgado, the former producer, getting a new job in San Francisco despite controversies including a song deemed offensive toward Asian tsunami victims. Callers weighed in, and the hosts discussed Delgado’s history, including the song ("Go find your mommy") and his past controversies.  Another offensive song by Delgado ("On our way to Christopher Street") was played. They discussed the reaction to his hiring, including comments from the National Organization of Chinese Americans.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Delgado's controversial past and his new position. Patrice O’Neal was a guest.


The final segment began with a listener complaining about a radio station hiring someone with a "horrid rap sheet," leading to a discussion about which groups hold the most power in media – with speculation that Jews hold the most power, followed by Black people. The discussion included numerous offensive stereotypes and racial slurs.  A significant portion focused on Rick Delgado and his interview defending his offensive "tsunami song," comparing it to a "blonde joke." The hosts and callers discussed differing societal responses to controversies involving different racial groups, highlighting perceived double standards and biases in the media, referencing the Howard Beach incident and the killing of Yankle Rosenbaum.  A caller named Marty Yang participated, and a brief interaction with a young man in the studio revealed a distant relation to Thomas Jefferson, accompanied by racial slurs and jokes. The segment concluded with a commercial.  No notable guest besides the in-studio caller was present.

And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Good morning.  Good morning, Anthony.  That was pleasant.  Did you replay that?  I missed some of it.  Ha, ha, ha.  That's the world we live in, everybody.  Wow.  That is a frightening place.  Where is that?  Why bother living?  What planet is that? 
[00:09:30]  You might as well just give up.  And people laugh at me for not wanting to leave the house?  Holy jeez.  Wow.  There you go.  A little frightening.  Just a tad frightening.  That's Dan Rather and his dangerous headlines.  Rather than her.  Headlines, it's just those key...  Little key phrases.  Key phrases that make you a little scared to live.  The news loves to use to scare the bejesus out of us.  Ah, wow.  There you have it.  Barbaric.  Blitz. 
[00:10:00]  How did you get into work today?  I, uh...  Did you take the subway?  A bus, maybe?  I took a cab.  A cab?  Yeah.  Oh, it was raining.  Okay.  Yeah.  You don't have, like, uh, treaded, uh, tires on your rollerblades?  Unfortunately, I do not.  And every once in a while, I have to, uh, take a cab with the savages.  With the savages.  Although I did get a white guy today, which was pretty impressive.  Yeah.  Very rare when that happens.  And actually, I don't mind the black guys. 
[00:10:30]  No?  Nah, it's the ones that have the weird, uh, last names on my mind.  Yeah.  The, uh, the sleeper cells, I like to call them.  Right.  Those ones.  Those are the ones you gotta worry about.  Actually, the most frightening, uh, cab drivers are just the white guys.  Because any white guy driving a cab these days is certifiably insane.  You know, you make a good point.  They're just crazy people.  They're the crazy ones?  Mm-hmm.  I think black people today are feeling a little good about themselves.  Yeah.  Because I think after 9-11, you know...  Yeah.  I mean, let's face it, this country is like a black and white thing all the time. 
[00:11:00]  All the time.  And then when 9-11 happened and the terrorism and stuff, all of a sudden, eh, the black people  weren't as bad.  We got together.  We certainly got together.  Yes.  Black and white.  We looked at each other and said, hey, we're all in this together.  That's right.  Let's get along.  That's right.  Work it out.  We know what could happen, uh...  Never mind, I'm not gonna go there.  But anyway...  There's a common enemy here, and it is not you and I.  That's right.  It's integration.  So then, uh... 
[00:11:30]  It's been a while.  9-11.  And then I think the black-white thing, especially in recent months, has been kind of creeping  up again.  Of course.  Kind of creeping back up again.  Mm-hmm.  There was a time after 9-11, man.  You went on a subway or walked the streets of New York, and you're nodding at your fellow  dark-skinned brothers.  We were all New Yorkers.  That's right.  All victims.  But then that black-white thing has been, uh, you know, poking up and showing its ugly  head again.  Right.  And now it's just squashed right back down again. 
[00:12:00]  Well, slow down.  For the most part.  Yeah.  And now we get to hate the savages again.  Yeah, it's because we share a common language.  That whole English thing that, uh, us and England kind of, you know, we look at them and  go, oh, this is awful, horrible.  If it happened in France, would we really give a shit?  When it happened in Spain, did we really give a shit?  Uh, Madrid?  Not really.  It was, you know, for, for, I don't know, we were kind of like, wow, you know, that's  tough and everything.  But, you know, we don't share a common language. 
[00:12:30]  They look a little different than we do.  So, fuck them.  I think the Madrid...  That's how we are.  I think the Madrid bombings on their subway system, whatever, on their trains, it was  a, um, it was in the news for maybe a couple days.  Yeah.  And it wasn't like this, though.  Like, oh, my God, here it is, barbaric, and this is terrorism, and it must be eliminated.  Like, what happened with Madrid?  That was huge.  That was, like, really brutal, and we kind of just, eh.  What happened to Madrid?  Yeah.  Like you said in the back office, what happened to the sharks? 
[00:13:00]  What the fuck happened to the sharks?  Where'd the sharks go?  They're still out there in the water, and...  All of a sudden, I didn't hear any...  I didn't hear one shark story yesterday.  After weeks and weeks, every day, we were hearing shark stories.  I guess, uh, there's no more sharks.  I guess, uh, you know, it's not important anymore.  The news made it very important that the sharks were in the water, and they were very dangerous.  Every day, we were learning how to avoid a shark attack.  What happened to that little blonde girl in Aruba? 
[00:13:30]  Aw, where's she?  I thought that was very important.  What happened?  Did they arrest somebody new?  You know damn well in Aruba.  They just, like, uh, told the crew.  Yeah.  All right, we're moving on.  We gotta go.  And there's the family of the Aruba girl.  But...  But what about us?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We'll take care of it.  Book a flight to London.  We gotta get out of here.  Big explosion.  Hurry, hurry, hurry.  We gotta go.  We gotta go.  We gotta go.  Okay, okay.  Ah, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.  Right, right.  We just shake the hand real quick. 
[00:14:00]  Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.  Or Bugs Bunny.  Goodbye!  I love that.  But I thought we were...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.  But I thought we were trying to solve the case.  Yeah, we're trying to solve the case.  We got right back on it.  Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.  But, but, but, but you're leaving now.  Yeah, temporarily.  Be right back.  Come on, come on, come on.  Vultures swooping in.  Vultures!  Some dope with half a leg is waiting for his exclusive interview on the Today Show. 
[00:14:30]  What happened?  I thought we were going to get the exclusive interview with Matt and Katie working on a book deal.  Right.  Yeah, sharks are dangerous.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sharks, sharks, sharks.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we realize.  Sharks, sharks, sharks.  We'll be back.  It's a cool day today.  Not a lot of people on the beach.  Fuck the sharks.  Shark, what sharks?  I absolutely love following the media.  It just makes me giggle every day now.  It's a hobby that I just embrace and love on a daily basis. 
[00:15:00]  People are looking for a new hobby.  That's the thing.  Watching the media and the way they handle life in general on a daily basis.  It's fascinating.  It's fascinating.  I could not take my eyes off the television yesterday with the London coverage of the bombing.  And CBS got on.  I guess it was about 6 o'clock.  And with the music and the graphic. 
[00:15:30]  Death, destruction, mayhem.  And then the graphic comes on and then they give it a title.  What's the title?  The Bombings of London.  And they had a big Bombings of London graphic that they had to make.  And you know there was a room.  What do we call this?  What are we going to call it?  What about the shark graphic?  Get rid of it.  We don't need it anymore.  But they make like this big TV show.  It's like a one day like a movie of the week.  An event that the news does. 
[00:16:00]  And it's just they can't get enough of it.  And then Fox News.  What despicable asshats over there.  They had that.  Who's the jack off that ran his car into that other news woman?  Shepard Smith.  Oh yeah.  They had Shep.  Good old Shep.  Shep was on.  And he's getting some report.  He goes okay we're getting a report right now.  Victoria Station. 
[00:16:30]  They're alerting people to get away from that station.  This is about 5 o'clock.  This is hours after anything has happened.  Hours after anything has happened.  Shepard Smith is telling people we're getting reports right now to get away from Victoria Station.  We're being told that authorities are telling people to run as quickly as you can away from this station.  No shit.  Those are the words he was using.  Five minutes later he comes back and goes um okay Victoria Station we're getting reports. 
[00:17:00]  All right there's no problem people.  We're getting reports now.  Business as usual.  At Victoria Station everybody's uh there's no problem there.  Five minutes before he was telling people to run for their lives from that station.  Like Godzilla came from town.  That's what it was.  He taught run as fast as you can away from it.  Ah!  Running just in panic inducing asses. 
[00:17:30]  Run Forrest run!  Just run away.  So.  They can't scare you enough with just the real news.  I think it's frightening enough.  I think just reporting what's happening is frightening enough.  You don't have to say there are more unexploded bombs out there.  Could they be more bombs waiting for emergency crews to get there to blow up?  It's like hours later.  We did the same thing at 9-11 where they say there's still planes in the air.  Oh my god one's inbound. 
[00:18:00]  Here it comes.  They just jump on it to try to get the maximum scare factor.  Yeah there was enough scare in the air you know.  Don't worry.  You got plenty to work with here.  And I understand the media should report this stuff.  It's just when they just over the top sensationalize that drives us nuts.  You do that all the time man.  Seltzer on his pants.  I don't think Anthony's going to be able to do the show now.  I have seltzer on my pants.  Why don't you go get your change of clothes immediately. 
[00:18:30]  And you bring in every day.  Just in case this happens you freak.  Eric paper towel please.  That's okay.  It's just water.  Yeah.  It's just a little water.  Yeah.  There we go.  It's just water right Ed?  Tidy that up.  It's just water right?  How many microbes are in this?  Frightening.  It's when they over the top sensationalize.  That's the point we like to make on the show.  When they just spend days.  And my sister's visiting from Florida.  It's a perfect example of what ends up happening. 
[00:19:00]  Okay.  She's in town from Florida.  We're having a good time.  And she's got to go back out to Long Island.  And she actually told me, asked me, she's like, you think the subways and the trains are really safe?  No.  Because, you know, of all of this stuff that's going on.  And I've seen the news coverage.  And she's like all freaked out.  Yeah.  Okay.  And I told her, like, today and yesterday were probably the safest days to ride the subways in New York.  And the trains in the New York area.  Right.  In the New York area.  It's not the days that something happens.  This guy's all over the place here in New York City with M16s. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  On almost every block, you've got the guys out just like it was 9-11 time again.  Yeah.  With the M16s on, I don't want to exaggerate, but every other corner or something like that?  Yeah.  Yeah, a lot of guys out there.  A lot of security.  But unfortunately, you know, my sister looks at the TV and she, you know, I don't want to say she believes at all,  but she certainly gets, you know, scared more than she has to be.  Are we safe?  Uh, no.  One channel blew it.  You know, we started by hating this Richard Huff guy in the Daily News. 
[00:20:00]  And he's great.  I like this guy a lot because he has a sense of humor and he just gets it.  And he gets it and he's able to pick up on some of this stuff that we've been goofing on.  The quirky stuff.  And we're going to try to get him on the air, but he writes a column for the Daily News called Tube Talk.  Listen to this.  Channel 11 spare coverage.  At the peak of the morning rush yesterday when many area residents were wondering whether it was safe to commute,  Channel 11 was offering footage of a backward bowler. 
[00:20:30]  A backward bowler.  That's what Channel 11 was doing.  See, this is the other side of it.  You've got the stations that over-sensationalize.  Yeah.  And then you've got the other channels that just aren't prepared.  Not prepared at all.  For anything.  Did anyone think Channel 11 here in New York is really prepared for anything as far as news goes?  Meanwhile, the people at Channel 11's morning rival, Channel 5, Good Day, New York.  Isn't that the WWWB?  Probably.  Wisely shelved all of their usual goofy features and silly segments to run wall-to-wall coverage of the explosions in London. 
[00:21:00]  Between 7 and 9 a.m. when Channel 5, Channel 11, and New York 1 are the only local newscasts on,  Chris Galis and Jody Applegate shared the screen with a live feed from London.  And throughout the two-hour stretch, they interviewed terrorism experts, Governor Pataki and others,  about the potential for an attack here and what precautions New Yorkers could take.  It was relevant information at the right time for local viewers.  There you go.  That's what you want. 
[00:21:30]  And then he goes on,  It's not that the folks at Channel 11's morning news didn't cover the explosions.  They did, just not as well as arrival or in enough depth to feed the need of air residents  who may have been worried about the city's mass transit system.  Instead, Channel 11 staffers limited coverage to news segments and updates with occasional field reports.  They also interspersed those updates with regular entertainment news segments,  a chat with soap star Cameron Matheson, and an interview with Hulk Hogan and his family. 
[00:22:00]  Terrorism's bad, brother.  What's you going to do when your bus explodes?  But basically, yeah, as you're flipping around the dial here in New York,  you're seeing all the coverage, and then Channel 11 has this guy bowling backwards.  Bowling backwards.  Well, that's fascinating.  He actually stands with his heels facing the pins and throws the ball backwards?  Yeah, throws the ball backwards.  Oh, there you go.  That might just be a little more important, I think, than the London bombing. 
[00:22:30]  Sure.  Put that on TV.  Some of them way overdo it, and then you've got Channel 11 news.  Really not prepared.  They just don't have the resources.  That's a channel here in New York that it's our local WB affiliate.  And they like to think they have a news program, and they don't.  They have some guys that sit in front of a teleprompter and read the news,  but when a story really breaks, it's not the WB news that you go to right away 
[00:23:00]  to get the breaking news on what's happening.  Oh, backwards bowling.  Unless you want the black perspective.  Jesus.  They had footage this morning of people lining up for Luther Vandross's wake, I guess.  Yep.  Oh, my God.  There's Luther singing his love songs and whatnot.  Boy, the audience, the women that were coming up there, every one of them weighed about 300 pounds. 
[00:23:30]  Every one of them could have kicked our ass.  300-pound black women.  Without an exception.  Mm-hmm.  They were all lined up, one after another.  And it wasn't even one different body type.  No.  They were all just big, fat black women waiting online to go see Luther.  To say goodbye to Luther.  Jake in New York, what's up?  Hey, boys.  I was just curious if they're calling it 7-7 now.  Yeah.  Slow down with that one.  I saw that in the news yesterday.  7-7. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Sorry.  You know.  All right, boys.  All right.  You know, thoughts and prayers.  Thoughts and prayers out to England and all, but slow down.  7-7.  Stop.  The Englands, you know, think back a few years back.  They're kind of used to this thing.  Like, it's not like bombs were always going off in New York City.  You know, in London, they're used to bombings.  These things happened.  The IRA, things were blowing up all the time. 
[00:24:30]  Huge buildings were being blown up.  One of the interesting things the news said, what is the second deadliest attack since?  Since World War II.  No, the worst attack.  Yeah.  That's what they said.  The worst attack in London since World War II.  Since World War II.  Kind of a drop-off there.  You know, I understand people are dead.  They're saying, what, 50 people, something like that?  Still getting reports.  It's awful, obviously.  But to say it's the worst attack since World War II, that's...  Maybe you could pick another reference point. 
[00:25:00]  That's being sensational, you know?  I think when, yeah, the Luftwaffe flying over your city, dropping incendiary devices on your  houses night after night after night, it's a little bit of a drop-off when you get 57  or 50-some-odd people killed in the subways.  And one double-decker bus, those stupid English double-decker buses.  You hate when those things cruise around New York here, too.  Oh, get out of the way.  I'm driving here. 
[00:25:30]  Here we go, Anthony.  The local news.  Today, terror strikes in London.  Fear, chaos, tragedy.  Over 30 reported dead.  Over 700 injured.  And next on ABC, a vital one-hour special edition of ABC News Primetime.  With stunning moment-by-moment accounts at the heart of the terror.  Breaking new details.  Exclusive reports.  And just how vulnerable are we here at home?  A day of terror.  A special edition of ABC News Primetime. 
[00:26:00]  An important must-see hour of television.  Next on ABC.  I'm scared shitless.  See, I mean, you made the point before we play that.  Do you need the dramatic voiceover?  The music was like The Exorcist.  Yeah, do you need the shining music?  That was horrible music.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  That's horror movie music.  That isn't news music.  That is meant like they use music in movies to set a mood and to scare you. 
[00:26:30]  If you took music out of horror movies, a lot of times, it would not be nearly as scary.  Music makes a huge impact on people as far as their emotions go and fear.  They put that music in there to heighten your fear.  Is that helping to inform you about this?  Is that helping at all?  Is that really a thing the news has to do?  Put a goddamn horror movie soundtrack to their teasers?  Yeah, we're already emotional about it.  Don't worry about it.  Just give us the friggin' facts.  We don't need a goddamn music bed behind it. 
[00:27:00]  Unbelievable.  I make a good point because the opening scene of The Shining when they're driving the car up the mountain there.  Yeah, would it be creepy without the music?  And it's during the day, you know, which usually isn't that scary in horror films.  Yeah.  But it's just terrifying, right?  We show you all the time when we put the funny music to a tragic speech.  Right.  Or vice-y-versy.  We show you how things like that work.  I was just going to say you're replacing music with like the Benny Hill music as the car's driving up.  You think you're getting ready for a comedy. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Music has a huge impact on the way people feel about something they're listening to.  There's no reason to put horror movie...  That was horror movie music!  No reason.  Coming up on Fox 5 News.  More and more smoke came in.  People started singing the last prayers.  We'll have the latest on the terror attacks in London.  Lost New York City now on heightened alert.  What's being done to keep you safe?  Tonight at 10.  What do you think's being done?  What's being done?  Absolutely nothing, you idiots.  Nothing.  Don't worry about it. 
[00:28:00]  They put cops out on the streets.  Don't worry about it.  Something's being done.  They put cops out on the streets for a day or two with a huge presence.  Meanwhile, nothing's going to happen the same day that something happens in London or a day after.  It's those days that you don't think about.  That's when stuff happens, when people let their guard down just a little bit.  But we're being told, Opie, that we are to be the eyes and ears now.  That's where the security comes from.  It's not the cops. 
[00:28:30]  It's not the CIA, FBI, nothing like that.  It's the American public.  New Yorkers, on a daily basis, we're being told now.  We're being told.  The police commissioner got on and said, and the mayor, that we, if we see something a little off, we're to call 3-1-1 and report it.  And if we see something really bad, like an imminent danger, then we call the 9-1-1.  But 3-1-1 we're supposed to call if we see something. 
[00:29:00]  Like what?  Are you calling?  Yeah.  What did you say?  Well, Eric's backpack was a little bigger than usual today.  Oh, all right.  Give a call.  How are you going to tell?  Do you think a terrorist is going to walk into a train with one of those big Yosemite Sam barrels of gunpowder with, like, dynamite written on it?  But it's going to be in a backpack, underneath clothing, things like that that you don't see. 
[00:29:30]  You're supposed to call every time you see somebody with a backpack and they lay it down on the subway.  There's no way you're going to tell.  It's just, you just got to live with the terror, with the fear.  That's where we live now.  Coming up tonight at Santeris, attacks in London, four huge explosions ripped through the underground,  killing many commuters and injuring hundreds.  We'll have live team coverage.  Plus, how safe are the rails in our area?  See what local cops are doing to protect you.  And chaos on the runway tonight at Santeris. 
[00:30:00]  What?  What the fuck?  Wait, there was chaos on the runway?  What happened?  I didn't hear one.  I was glued to the news yesterday.  Chaos on the runway.  If there was chaos on some runway somewhere, don't you think it would have made the news?  What do they have footage of people?  Yeah.  Chaos is a pert-strong word to use when runway is involved.  Why don't you get the definition of chaos, please?  You know what chaos on the runway is?  The Canary Islands when two jumbo jets slammed into each other. 
[00:30:30]  I would consider that chaos on the runway.  Does anyone even know what the chaos was?  Is it in the papers?  If you're using the word chaos, it's got to be pretty...  Dick Ebersole's plane sliding down the runway.  That's chaos on the runway.  What is that?  A couple of savage baggage handlers fighting over a Samsonite bag?  I don't even know what the story is.  A little chaos on the runway.  What's chaos on the runway?  Yeah.  Please?  Somebody?  That is not a story. 
[00:31:00]  Chaos.  Chaos.  Maybe it was a modeling thing.  Maybe it had nothing to do with it.  Oh, maybe.  Maybe it was some sort of two models walked out together while one's music was playing.  Perhaps it's a new startup airline, Chaos Air.  Yeah.  Chaos on the runway taking off on their maiden flight.  Who knows?  Chaos.  I know it wasn't what they said it is.  Chaos.  There's no seats.  It's just a plane with a big snack in the middle of a bunch of fat people fighting over it.  Well, we're trying to find out what the chaos on the runway story is all about. 
[00:31:30]  Details about what police already found in London that could crack the case.  When they say they're going to go after countries, they mean it.  What it was like to be in London the day the terrorists attacked.  Returning travelers tell us.  New tonight, what local commuters should look out for.  And what a difference a day makes.  We're also on top of new developments in a local tuberculosis scare.  And powerful hurricane.  Hang on.  What?  Way to cut off.  Watch. 
[00:32:00]  There's a powerful hurricane with tuberculosis in it.  That was Jay from New Hampshire.  Yeah.  Great reception you get up there, Jay.  Still taping with real audio.  What is that?  Yeah.  Big VHS tape on his rabbit ears.  Jay helps us out a lot.  But, Jay, come on.  Step it up a notch.  It's the year 2005.  Let's get some equipment.  It's cheap these days.  Tonight, terror attacks in London.  America now on high alert.  From public transportation to national security.  How vulnerable is the U.S.? 
[00:32:30]  Well, we know how vulnerable we are.  We saw it.  Look at that.  No, it's not New York City on heightened alert.  New York City's been on orange since 9-11.  It doesn't go down here.  It goes down in the rest of the country.  It doesn't go down here.  They stepped up the buses and subways.  They stepped up the alert there.  For like a couple of days. 
[00:33:00]  Then it goes back to where it was.  They make it sound like we just heightened it.  Go to red!  Go to red!  Liars.  They're all liars.  All right.  We got the chaos story from Adam in New Jersey.  Chaos on the runway.  What was it, Adam?  It was a guy on a Lufthansa jet that went crazy on the airline.  He was harassing the passengers before it took off.  So they stopped the plane.  Isn't that chaos in the fuselage?  I would call that chaos in the fuselage. 
[00:33:30]  Who was hassling people?  Yeah.  Who was he?  He was just some passenger on the plane.  That's all I saw.  Shouldn't that story just be called Asshole on a Plane?  Yeah.  Not chaos on the runway.  That's like chaos.  It's in chaos.  That's asshole.  Asshole on the plane.  And there's one on every fucking flight.  Thank you.  Punch out.  Lufthansa flight?  Yeah.  Jimmy!  Does this mic sound right to you or no?  You?  I haven't talked yet, so I don't know.  Yeah, what are you doing? 
[00:34:00]  Jesus.  I don't know.  You guys talk about terrorism.  I get shy of this.  It's going to happen here.  It's just a scary prospect.  All right.  Here we go.  And now American cities are on edge.  NYPD steps up security measures to make certain we are all safe here.  We're at home.  Certain?  How can you make certain we're safe?  How do you make certain?  I love picking out these words they use.  Here's more dramatic music, Anthony.  The Target.  Rush hour commuters in London. 
[00:34:30]  Three separate explosions on the city's subways.  And one that literally tore apart a double-decker bus.  Tonight, picking up the pieces.  Who did it?  Why?  And could it happen here?  Muslims, because they're assholes.  And yes, next program.  Really?  There you go.  All the answers.  There you go.  The news can be five seconds long.  I just got goosebumps from the dramatic music, though.  Ding, ding, ding, ding. 
[00:35:00]  Horror movie.  You could play that music over any movie, like The Ring, The Exorcist, any of these movies,  that music fits perfectly.  Why is it being played with the news?  With that deep voice, scary.  This could get you.  Police siren, like, little noise in the background.  Yeah, yeah.  Pan from left to right.  It's coming.  It's right in the room with me.  Frightening.  Let's say hi to Mitch.  Mitch, what's up?  Hi, guys.  How's it going?  Hey, Mitch from Montreal. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, I found out what the chaos on the runway was, because we have, you know, some very  high-tech information here.  It was Ben's hog.  Well, that would cause chaos on the runway.  It certainly would, sir.  You're not cleared for takeoff?  Some were calling it Nessie.  That was Don Adams from Get Smart.  He was coming in there to clear up the chaos.  Another guy from chaos on Get Smart?  Hey, are you guys...  He's still trying.  He's still trying.  I'm not even going to acknowledge.  Are you guys scared up there? 
[00:36:00]  Uh, well...  What is Canada doing to prepare?  Ooh.  What's your news saying?  How are you preparing?  What, is there one extra Mountie out there?  Hey.  Patrolling the area?  You're guarding your big stupid tower?  We're...  Canada doesn't do anything, really.  We just sit here.  You know that, uh, you guys are just, uh, leasing that land until we decide we want it,  right?  I know.  I know.  The second we need more room, I swear to you, right now you are living in, like, North 
[00:36:30]  Montana.  That's all.  It's going to happen slowly.  You know, we'll take over, like, Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal.  We'll go up that high.  Yeah.  And then all you guys will have to go even further, North.  Now, how does it feel to know there's nothing you could do about it?  That's right.  Like, there...  You don't have any type of army that could, uh, fend off a United States invasion.  I'm just praying you come.  I'm like, please.  This guy is such a self-hating Canadian.  He didn't start off that way.  I know.  I love it. 
[00:37:00]  I just like...  You remember the Iraqis when they came in and they were coming out with the flags?  I love you.  I love you.  Please.  That's what you'd be doing.  Oh, I'd be coming kissing your feet.  All right.  I'd be there.  Little Jimmy...  Little Jimmy would be coming.  I'd be like, let me...  Here, let me dump a log on your chest.  Anything.  Just please come to Canada.  I love the self-hating Canadian guy.  He's great.  That's great, Mitch.  He's a beaten man, and it didn't take much.  All right, Mitch.  Ivan Beach.  They would just have to stand there and take it.  I know.  I've been to Montreal. 
[00:37:30]  I think we should take that one back.  Send a couple of Mounties down.  You know, their Mounties with their red suits.  We should give them Buffalo and take it out of Montreal, I'm thinking.  Yeah?  Yeah, a little trade.  A little trade.  And our army ran through.  They'd all just be standing there with signs.  We don't appreciate this.  Yeah.  Hey, knock it off.  We'd prefer you didn't.  We'd prefer you didn't.  Very good.  All right.  Back to...  We just have a couple more of these terror news.  Yes, it's very frightening, Opie. 
[00:38:00]  Terror attacks rock London.  The shock and devastation on the streets.  An expert analysis on what's behind this day of terror.  Plus, the blast put our area on alert.  CBS 2's team of reporters show how tri-state security is being stepped up.  Also, the menace of Dennis.  See the hurricane's path of fury and the tropical weather heading our way.  You know, they're not even confident enough.  They're like, well, this terror angle, it's not good enough to scare the shit out of our viewers.  So why don't we throw some hurricane stuff in there, too?  We need a hurricane.  Right. 
[00:38:30]  And he has to rhyme it.  That's nice.  He's going to ruin people's lives.  He makes a rhyming word out of it.  The menace of Dennis.  Yeah, it's already killed people.  Owie.  Beheaded by Zika.  I was like, ah!  It's totally so where you were going, too.  It's hard to say, beheaded by Zika.  Zika.  Suck.  Yuck.  Flubbing idiot.  I guess we should do rhymes today on the show.  Yeah.  For other headlines.  There you go.  There's today's bit.  See how easy this radio thing is to do?  I said rhyme something.  Then you just sit back and let the listeners do all the work. 
[00:39:00]  Rhyming news stories and go.  And take it.  Plus, high alert here at home.  Security stepped up.  What's happening to keep you safe?  What is happening to keep me safe?  I'm so concerned.  Today, starting at 5, New York steps up security after a deadly terrorist attack shakes London.  How safe is our city?  Is our city.  And just ahead in Family Matters, a very timely topic in light of today's events.  How to choose a guardian for your children in case something tragic happens to you. 
[00:39:30]  What?  Yeah, because you know that a lot.  Well, I'm sure there were people that died that were parents.  So perhaps you need to know where your kids are going to be if you get blown up.  That's where the story gets better, by the way.  Right now, it's very easy to do this coverage if you're one of these idiots out there.  But then by Monday, they still know that people will be tuning in for their coverage.  They need new angles.  Oh, those angles are always great. 
[00:40:00]  They start really getting off on the edges, the little fringes of this story.  You want to talk about deep tracks.  They go deep.  Deep tracks on the story.  Oh, they go deep.  What will your kids do if you're blown up in a subway?  Right.  All right.  What to look for?  So that was just, you know, we gave an American assignment and we got one in from Jay in New Hampshire.  Thank you, Jay.  The rest of the country, thanks for nothing.  Thanks for nothing.  Like you didn't have the scary news teasers in your city. 
[00:40:30]  Of course they did.  I think they were a little frightened of us.  We kind of dressed them down a bit because they sent us some real crap as far as news teasers go.  And maybe they don't want to be embarrassed.  A little embarrassing for them.  Maybe they're sitting back and going, you know what?  I'm paying for this shit.  You guys do all the work.  You do a goddamn show.  What the hell?  Yes, some people are finally catching on.  Why are we doing your show for you? 
[00:41:00]  They're on to us.  It's time to move again.  And here comes the first rhyme.  Let's go to Rick in New York City.  Rick?  Rich, actually.  Sorry, Rich.  Yeah.  I seen one last night.  It was, stay tuned as we show you how one woman made five in a tub go glub, glub, glub.  That's Jimmy's bit.  You stole it verbatim.  Verbatim.  Shut up.  Verbatim.  Verbatim.  I think that might make my list of silly words. 
[00:41:30]  Verbatim.  I know, but I like how you say it.  That's how Park says it.  So far, I got poopy, hiney, and lozenge on the list of silly words.  Lozenge.  Dave in Ohio, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys.  How's it going?  Hey.  You know what makes me sick about the news the most is, you know, like, they act all concerned.  Like, they care about us and they're trying to help.  But really, I mean, like, when these tragedies happen, you know that they're happy.  They're like, oh, boy, we got to get this. 
[00:42:00]  This is going to be great for our ratings.  Right.  They're very happy.  They really don't give a crap about all the people that died or what could happen.  They love news.  They love when it happens like that.  Well, that was the point we made about a half hour ago by saying, you know, where do the  sharks go?  You know?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Where's the concern for that girl in Aruba?  You know, it's time to move on.  Time to, you know, get all the cameras packed and on a plane to London.  Well, that's all I got.  Punching out, guys.  Love you, Jimmy.  I love you, mister. 
[00:42:30]  Thanks for the call.  All right.  Let's go to Al in Jersey.  Al.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Yeah.  I tried to get away from all this shit yesterday, so I want to get my Yankee update on SportsCenter  and ESPN.  The first fucking 15 minutes of it is, are you a duck in your stadium?  Wait, what did they say?  Maybe, are you safe in your stadium?  Yeah.  You're a sitting duck in your stadium.  Ah.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Right?  You're sitting there watching a game.  There's quite a few thousand people right around you. 
[00:43:00]  What a great target that would be.  And that's happened so far.  How many times have you...  Oh, my God.  Too many to count.  It's, um, yeah, a lot.  You know what the security is like at stupid ball games now?  It's ridiculous.  You can't bring anything in with you.  You cannot bring a bag or a backpack into a sporting event with you anymore.  You're not allowed.  They search you.  They tell you you can't bring that in.  You've got to buy their food now.  You buy everything that they have.  Girls, even with pocketbooks, that gets searched.  Everything gets searched.  Mostly so you have to buy their food. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  And they use the excuse that you might be carrying something in.  Yeah.  But the reality is they want you to buy their food.  But how could you buy it?  Because I saw a story.  Danger of stadium food?  Not only do you have to buy their food, they know they got you.  So they hike the prices up to an amount that is just unbelievable.  Ridiculous.  You can't even take your friend there and have a couple of wieners.  No.  You want to go to a ball game, have a Coke and a wiener.  It'll cost you $200.  I am taking this next phone call for Jimmy and for Anthony. 
[00:44:00]  Oh.  Okay.  I am sacrificing my own happiness right now.  Don't be.  Why?  I want you to be happy.  Tom in Kentucky.  How you doing, boys?  Hey, Tom.  Is London rattled?  Next with Pat Battle.  Was Pat dead?  Did she turn up with any...  I'm sure she's doing some irrelevant report somewhere on something.  Horrible.  How safe were the wheels on the bus?  Just some awful...  Was it blown tires? 
[00:44:30]  No, Pat.  So it wasn't.  Some horrible Jersey story.  Some Jersey angle.  Hey, we got some cuts from the AP.  London commuters.  Ooh.  You got to hear this first guy.  I don't mean to make light of this, but...  Yes, you do.  Man, they talk weird over there.  I know I'm being Captain Obvious, but listen to this guy.  Were you worried at all about taking this train after what happened?  No, not really.  Why not?  Just...  Just the way it goes.  Just us lining the way around. 
[00:45:00]  We had it.  We were at the R.A.  We had it.  We were all the others.  We'd just get on with life, didn't we?  We'd be downcast for a couple of days, but...  But when the R.A. bombs were here, after a couple of days, back to normal.  Dude, that first guy, what the fuck did he say?  I have no idea.  Hey, did you, buddy?  You made you do it, baby?  Can we hear the first guy again?  What the hell was that?  One of those bombs.  Were you worried at all about taking this train after what happened?  No, not really.  Why not?  Just the way everybody goes.  Just us lining the way around. 
[00:45:30]  We had it.  We were at the R.A.  We had it.  We were all the others.  We'd just get on with life, didn't we?  We'd be downcast.  I think he's talking about something about the...  Did the R.A. come up in there somewhere?  The second guy.  No, I think even the first guy.  Oh, really?  It might have been.  Go all the way back.  It might have been something with the R.A.  Were you worried at all about taking the train after what happened?  No, not really.  Why not?  Just the way everybody goes.  Just us lining the way around.  We had it.  We were at the R.A.  We had it all the others.  We'd just get on with life, didn't we?  We had it. 
[00:46:00]  We had it.  All right.  He did say something like that.  There's something about the R.A.  We had it then.  I don't know what that fucking line of you is saying.  Jesus Christ.  That's English?  That's English.  Thank God we broke off from them and refined their language so that everyone can understand it.  Let's go to Jeff in New Jersey.  Jeff?  Parents, beware.  Is your kid keeping an online blog?  Next thing you know, he's sucking Ben's hog. 
[00:46:30]  Oof.  Wow.  You really, uh...  Only because you started with parents beware.  Yeah.  Whenever you have a colon in a joke, it never works.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to John in Connecticut, it looks like.  John, go ahead.  Hey, guys.  I'm actually on Long Island.  There was a story on the news last night that I was listening to at work about, uh, could this happen in Connecticut?  And what they're doing to, uh, beef up the security.  I think Connecticut can calm down.  I don't think Connecticut is a primary target. 
[00:47:00]  Right.  No, I was going to go bomb, uh, Regis Philbin's house, which would be a pleasure, but...  What, are they going to do a bomb 95 and improve traffic?  Really?  Connecticut stinks.  Yeah, there's cities like Connecticut, Philly.  They're lucky to be close to New York.  Don't worry about it.  Because if the terrorists are going to come all this way, they're not going to go to Connecticut when they can go to New York.  They're not going to go to Philly when they can come to New York.  My God, they've bombed Greenwich.  Right.  Stop.  Stop already.  There's all those cities, though, you know, all across the country, all in the Midwest and everything. 
[00:47:30]  It's not going to...  You guys are in much more danger of some lunatic militia asshole blowing you up than you are a terrorist.  Some kind of foreign terrorist.  Don't worry about it.  New York, L.A.  Did I mention New York?  That's all you've got to worry about.  New York, New York, New York.  D.C.  D.C.  D.C. is a problem.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's get another clip here.  Perhaps Boston.  Orlando.  Perhaps Maine.  Or Vermont.  The Ben & Jerry's.  He's at the heart of America. 
[00:48:00]  How are we going to get our ice cream, then?  I mean, that's my point, O.P.  All right.  Let's hit this clip here.  You can't let this affect you.  If you let it affect you, then, you know, those people have won.  You've just got to get back to some sense of normality.  And my thing today is I'm going to get on the tube and just travel, even if it's a couple  of stops.  You really got to realize the British, you just can't fucking, they're unflappable.  They really are unflappable.  They really are.  They will just sit there and have their tea. 
[00:48:30]  They will have, I'm sure they didn't miss tea time when that came around.  Oh, probably good then.  Let's go to Niagara Falls.  Jay?  Oh.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  What's up, Jay?  Yeah, I wake up this morning and it says, possible attack at Niagara Falls Power Authority.  And it talks about releasing blueprints and all.  They're going to beef up the security for that.  Like, what the fuck, man?  What are they going to do, shut it off?  They're saying how it's the number one power generator in western New York and fifth 
[00:49:00]  in the United States.  That's what they're gunning for.  Fifth.  They want the fifth most important thing.  The terrorists.  What's the fifth most important city in America?  Fifth?  Yeah.  That would be something silly like San Francisco.  That would be like New York, Washington, Los Angeles.  Could it be Philly as number five?  Boston.  I would say Boston's number four. 
[00:49:30]  I think Boston was six.  No.  As far as market, radio market goes.  Oh, sorry.  No, we're talking importance in this country's, like.  Economy.  Yeah, economy.  Pretty much.  Yeah.  And politically and just, because Washington.  Yeah, of course.  You know, you get New York, Washington, L.A., Boston.  Then you think Philly?  Philly's a big city, man.  Maybe Kansas City.  Philly's a biggie.  Big city.  Kansas City.  Dallas. 
[00:50:00]  Dallas Harrison.  Jesus.  Kansas City, here I come.  Kansas City.  Chicago.  Oh, yeah.  Chicago.  Chicago.  How about Chicago?  That's big.  Chicago.  Let's play another clip from a London commuter here.  Absolutely disgusted.  Really am.  I just can't believe it.  Bloody dreadful.  And I think it's about time we actually kicked back at these people and sorted them out properly.  Because you just can't go on like this.  It's ridiculous.  And sorted them out properly.  Sorted them out properly.  What the, what is that?  Wow, that's a threat.  That was his way of saying, let's commit genocide. 
[00:50:30]  Believe me, British are colonizing motherfuckers.  They're not going to tolerate this.  Properly.  Properly.  Over tea.  Yes.  That must be the tea.  I think those Muslims have to be corrected.  Really?  It's like Grady in there.  And when France tried to stop us from doing our duty.  They had to be corrected as well.  Let's go to Heather in Jersey.  She thinks she knows what that guy was saying. 
[00:51:00]  The English guy.  Heather.  Morning, guys.  I think another faithful listener of the program, right?  Yes.  The English guy said, we had it with the IRA.  We had it with all the others.  That's the way it goes.  That's what he said, huh?  Wait, let's stay on the line.  Let's hear that again.  Go ahead.  Were you worried at all about taking the train after what happened?  No, not really.  Why not?  Just the way it goes.  That's not the way around.  We had it.  We had it with the IRA.  We had it with all the others.  We just got it with life.  That is exactly it. 
[00:51:30]  I thought he said, Greg.  And Tony showed Greg.  And Tony showed Greg.  Tony got done.  De Norton with.  Sex, bye.  Wearing a bag.  Spread the hip.  It's an XM.  Wow, you remember it still?  I missed that.  Yeah, kind of.  I missed that one.  It's catchy, isn't it?  We'll find that going into break.  Yeah, see you.  Thank you, Heather.  You can't have British children and Muslim children.  You're going to get a conglomerated mulatto mongerized.  They're both ways to be destroyed.  Properly destroyed.  Properly.  Let's get a commuter number four. 
[00:52:00]  I worked for Canta Fitzgerald at the time of the 9-11 disaster.  And it all brought it back with what they went through.  You know, it was our turn yesterday.  Fortunately, I was in work early.  And that saved us this time around.  Saved us.  Yeah, they all got them stories.  Oh, is there?  Me alarm didn't go off.  So I would have been on the bus when it exploded.  They all got those stories like everybody did here.  Doesn't Colin have a bit on that?  I love Colin. 
[00:52:30]  How everyone tried to tie themselves in with 9-11.  He goes, you know, I wasn't on that two train.  Do you normally take the two train?  No, I've never taken the two train in my life.  He goes, Colin, everybody's trying to make it look like they had into it.  She's like, something told me not to go down there.  Yeah, stupid.  The news told you not to go down there.  He had the funniest shit after 9-11, man.  He could do it a month after and it wasn't offensive to anybody.  It was really great stuff.  I can't tell you how many people said, you know, I was on, you know, at that restaurant  at the top of the world. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, Windows on the World.  Windows on the World.  You know, the top of the Twin Towers there.  When?  June?  No, not even.  1995.  Oh, really?  Like years ago?  Yeah, well, most of New York has been up there.  Been up there to check it out.  I had the duck up there once.  It was very, it was lovely.  Very nice restaurant.  You know how many Midwestern people or people from around the country?  I said, we were going to go to New York then.  Oh, we were going to go.  You were?  Where?  Finger Lakes.  Yeah.  Syracuse. 
[00:53:30]  I kind of did that bit to Anthony yesterday.  I go, man, I was thinking of going to London.  Yeah, I was thinking of going there.  Well, really?  My God, you're tied right in.  Congratulations.  That's crazy.  You mean you thought of London?  Good thing you missed the bubonic plague of the 1500s.  Call good morning.  13.  I think it was 12.  Call.  Ah, forget it.  I had a great line, too.  Fuck that.  Go ahead.  Say it.  Let us be the judge.  No, not now.  Why not?  It happens.  Fuck you.  Come on.  No one listens to this fucking program.  Spit it out.  That's not true.  I'm listening right now.  Spit it out.  Take a swig of coffee and let it rock like it was brand new. 
[00:54:00]  Why?  I guarantee it was a good one, too.  Well, did the good ones stand up?  I was feeling it.  I was in the zone.  But no one fucking listens.  That's not true.  He listens.  The good ones stand up to these delays like this.  Nope.  The good ones stand up.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  Nope.  The good ones stand up.  No, I'd rather hear more Shining references.  Go ahead.  All right.  All right.  Jesus.  I'm so pissed right now.  I had a really good one. 
[00:54:30]  But I learned from past experiences that it's all about timing.  But you gotta give it out now.  I tried three times.  Listen to the replay.  All right.  All right.  Now.  Now.  No!  No, no.  Wait, wait, wait.  Not in the context that it is now a joke anymore.  Okay.  We realize the moment has passed.  But now you just have to tell us what it would have been.  I'm not gonna play your...  You have to tell us what it would have been.  I'm not gonna play your silly games.  No.  We understand now that it's not gonna be funny.  It's not the right time.  It's past.  Yeah.  But I gotta know what it was gonna be.  All work and no play makes Greg a dull boy. 
[00:55:00]  It was a pat battle line.  Oh, see?  Now we enjoy that.  Of course it wasn't a pat battle line, you ass.  Come on.  I hate the pat battle thing, too.  Why?  We love pat battle.  What was it?  You can just tell us.  Just shut up.  In the context of just the show.  Why did you think I was born?  But I really want to hear what it was gonna be.  Do you think I just came out of college radio?  Are you insane?  But it's not...  If you're doing it like saying this is what it was gonna be, no one expected you to get  a laugh at this.  I absolutely...  Ten minutes removed. 
[00:55:30]  I absolutely would tell you what it would have been.  I started the line, I think, three times.  No.  I think...  What were we talking about?  Let's see what we...  I know.  Okay, what were we talking about?  No.  We were doing what we were talking about.  At least what were we talking about?  No.  Gotta know, though.  I know what it was.  I know...  Because I know where we were.  It was some joke about the Odeon, July 23rd.  Oh, Christ on a pony.  What?  You know what?  You are horrible.  But that's what it was.  I do have to take my beating.  Could Opie explain how to get to the city of Connecticut?  No one picked up on that one. 
[00:56:00]  Proving my point, no one listened.  No one listened.  That was five minutes of banter right there.  I mean, the instant feedback, they all heard it.  Hey, Opie, Connecticut isn't a city, dipshit.  Ooh.  I corrected you.  Corrected me.  You guys, you know, you guys thought it was a city.  Ha, ha.  No, I didn't.  I wasn't listening.  I wasn't listening either.  Obviously.  Okay, what was it?  That's what I hate about the replays.  You just realize that no one listens.  No one listens.  All right. 
[00:56:30]  We're just eagerly awaiting our chance to jump in and be stars of the day.  And I know why he doesn't want to say the line, because he knows it's one of those  ones that you could probably find a way to save and probably get...  Ah, you're going to use it later.  It might be something that we'll be able to tie in somehow.  That might make sense.  You took it out of your mouth, stuck it underneath your console, and later on, you're going to  pick it back off and eat it.  During the replay, I'm pushing forward.  I had a lot of confidence.  I really did.  But now I have none.  So forget it.  Oh.  It's not about confidence.  I mean, how many bombs do I throw out of shows? 
[00:57:00]  It's got to be at least one per four hours.  But there are days...  But there's moments on every show where you just know you have a killer line.  It's the ones that you're not sure of.  Those are the ones you're...  You know what I mean?  But there are times you know you're in the zone like, oh my God.  Bam!  And you know it kills.  Damn.  It's like seeing that fastball right down the middle and you're just eyeing it.  Boom!  But now I've got to know.  I thought that Owie and Zarkali would kill, but I tripped on it eagerly.  I know you've got to know, Ant, and that's why I won't do it. 
[00:57:30]  Because I want to drive you nuts.  It's freaking me out.  With your foibles.  Foibles?  I don't believe that's one of my foibles.  Is it a rhyme?  I bet it was a rhyme.  Was it a rhyme?  No.  A-go figure.  I'm not a good...  I'm not good at rhyming.  Jesus.  I mean...  Well, let's go...  Did you actually get it out?  No, I started, I think, at least twice, maybe three times.  Don't worry, you'll hear it on replay.  But no, you didn't say it. 
[00:58:00]  No, no, no, don't worry, you'll hear on replay that I tried my best to get it out.  Yeah.  And I paused two or three times.  Oh, there she is.  They just showed Pat Battle.  NBC.  Are you kidding?  No, look at her.  Oh, wait, where is she?  Wonderful.  She's just lovely.  Such a big gal.  She sure is.  Oh, look at that.  Are you guys aware that Giuliani was in London there yesterday?  Yeah.  Yeah, perhaps Giuliani shouldn't be traveling anywhere.  He's like a terrorist magnet. 
[00:58:30]  He was there a couple of blocks away from one of the explosions, he said.  Gave a little rah-rah speech.  They had some English guy interviewing him and asking him a bunch of questions about the attacks in New York  and how England is holding up under this, and all he did was really lap a lot of English ass.  You know, we should explain this for the rest of the country,  although they saw the Giuliani stuff during 9-11, obviously.  But now we've got Mayor Bloomberg in New York, and it's just not the same.  You don't feel as safe.  You just don't.  Giuliani got up there and was like, ah, live your lives, and this is what you do, 
[00:59:00]  and this is what we have to deal with when you're in a free society, and he just made you feel good.  Yeah.  And Bloomberg's like, well, you know, you're going to go about your line.  With his whiny voice.  Whiny voice.  And we got a police presence on the subways today.  And he was using some of the same Giuliani lines, but it was just wimpier, a lot wimpier.  Yeah.  It just wasn't the same. 
[00:59:30]  They asked Giuliani what inspired him during 9-11 to be able to get out there and really rally the people,  and he's saying that he was inspired by the English and how they handled the Blitz in World War II.  Didn't he say that he went home and read a book on Winston Churchill?  Winston Churchill.  The whole city is collapsing, and he went home to read.  I'm going to read a little book.  Not only did he go home and read, he made it make sense. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  Well, you know, Churchill was great.  He read a whole book on Winston Churchill to get his inspiration or something.  Yeah.  When does this guy have time to read a Winston Churchill book?  I couldn't read that.  They dropped Churchill flyers with bombs all over the city.  I just couldn't get interested in a Churchill biography.  Churchill.  What happened in 1840?  All right, let's, well, Giuliani had some things to say.  Let's go to the first clip here.  I was right near Liverpool Station when the, I guess it was the first bombing took place, 
[01:00:30]  so we could hear the sirens, and then kept getting reports of different bombings in different parts of the city.  And it sounded like Opie was starting to say, call good morning America.  I think he was going for the interview since he tied into the event by thinking about going to London.  I have no idea what you're talking about, Matthew T. from Arizona. 
[01:01:00]  You know what?  Was it some kind of?  Matthew T. is brilliant.  Really?  Yes.  It doesn't sound as good now, but, yeah, it was about, because I was thinking of going to London.  Right.  Call one of these news shows for my exclusive interview, but it was, yeah.  But that was it?  Oh, he nailed it.  He nailed it.  Yeah, he nailed it.  Wow, Matthew.  Absolutely nailed it.  Holy shit.  That is really good.  Creepy.  Boy, that is a real, see, Matthew's listening.  But it was all during the whole thing. 
[01:01:30]  It would have, of course, it was just a quick thing.  That would have been just a quick chuckle.  You fucking asshole.  I hate you, Matthew.  You fuckers.  I can't wait to retire and leave this mess to somebody else. 
[01:02:00]  Let's go to Joe in New Jersey.  Joe.  Hey, boys.  What's up, Joe?  That's the longest wait for a car crash ever.  Yeah, but I didn't have the energy.  I didn't give it the gusto.  I hear you.  I would have made it a little, hopefully, funnier.  All right, go ahead, Joe.  I was going to say, those English dudes sound like Mickey the Piker from Snatch.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, that was good.  You couldn't understand him.  Actually, we got a couple of those Snatch clips there. 
[01:02:30]  Snatch.  I love that movie, Snatch.  You've never seen Snatch?  No.  What?  Opie, did you say something?  Yeah, why?  I don't know.  I guess I wasn't listening.  Oh, boy.  Wow, Joe.  Way to get in character, stupid.  Wow.  And then he had to try it three times.  And then he just bailed right out.  Here's some dialogue from Snatch.  It does sound like that commuter.  Yes, London.  You know, fish, chips, cup of tea, bad food, worse weather, Mary fucking Poppins, London.  No, that was, what's his name? 
[01:03:00]  Dennis Leary?  Huh?  Sounds like Dennis Leary.  No, it's...  No, that other guy.  The dude from...  Get Shorty.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What the hell's the name of that actor?  Got the Travolta punches right in the nose there.  Chaz Palmetari?  No.  He's a fine actor, Chaz Palmetari.  Fran Drexner?  The caller's talking about pretty much Brad Pitt in Snatch.  Dennis Farina.  Farina.  That's right.  Thank you.  Anything to declare?  Midnight Run.  If anyone doesn't know what Dennis Farina is, he's Midnight Run.  He was the mobster. 
[01:03:30]  Anything to declare?  Yeah.  Don't go to England.  Ooh.  All right.  Have a cream soda.  Relax.  I think he's pretty much talking about Brad Pitt's character in Snatch.  Yeah.  Where that's one of the options on the DVD where you can have subtitles.  Subtitles?  Every time he talks and only when he talks.  Handy.  Do you have any audio of Brad Pitt?  I heard he could unintelligible on that film.  Oh, it's great.  I want to...  It's great.  You don't like Brad Pitt as an actor, do you?  No, man.  Why is that?  He's not a good actor. 
[01:04:00]  He's not a good actor.  I don't think he's a great actor, but I think he pulls off whatever he's doing.  He was really good in Fight Club, though.  I've got to give it to him.  Yeah.  And actually...  Yeah, whatever.  I hate him.  What was the movie with him and Spacey?  The serial killing movie.  Oh, Seven.  You didn't like that?  Couldn't get into that.  That was such a great concept of a movie.  You watched Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey.  Morgan Freeman was brilliant in that movie.  We talk about how he plays the same role, but man, in Seven, he was unbelievable.  And Brad Pitt was good in Snatch, actually.  Yeah.  And Fight Club. 
[01:04:30]  And Fight Club.  You don't like Edward Norton, either?  Don't hate him.  I think he's overrated.  Overrated?  Really?  I think he's really good.  Since Primal Fear, I thought he was overrated.  That was a great performance, I think.  You didn't like him in American Axe?  I liked it.  I didn't love it.  I liked it.  Oh, my God.  I didn't love it.  I didn't love it.  You felt sorry for his character by the end there.  Yeah, I mean...  That's tough to pull off, I think, in any movie.  I felt sorry, too, for him.  He had such a great life and everything, you know, all that fun he was having.  No, I understand. 
[01:05:00]  I understand.  But that's what was crazy about that, you know, how brutal of a character he was in the beginning of the movie.  And then to actually feel sorry for the guy by the end of the movie, in a way?  Yeah.  That is...  Losing all his good friends.  Yeah.  That's fun people.  Had to grow his hair in.  That must be a drag.  Truck got scratched in a river robbery in the beginning of the movie.  Stuffed on that man's teeth.  God, put your teeth on the curb.  Yeah.  Someone out there is agreeing with me.  Correct him.  That's what I like about the show. 
[01:05:30]  There's always someone that agrees with you.  Well, yeah.  Put that guy's mouth on the thing and he went, yeah, crack.  You better curb your enthusiasm.  Oh, litty.  Wow, Jim.  I don't know if you did this, but let's see.  Anthony.  Oh, it's Anthony.  Jimmy, what's up?  Hey.  Jim, I got a question for you.  Who's Fran Dreschner?  Did I do that wrong?  Is it Drescher?  You tell me.  I think it's Fran Drescher.  Oh.  Fran and table.  See you later, guys. 
[01:06:00]  I always call a Fran Dreschner, always Dreschner.  How about we go back to doing a radio show where no one corrects anyone?  You know, that would be rough.  We'd all be sitting here just staring at people.  That would be really nice.  And then the listeners don't have to slam us.  It would be just a nice little radio world.  When it used to just skate right by.  Yeah.  I like those days a lot better.  Why is there a pool of saliva in front of you?  No reason.  All right.  We got another clip from Giuliani in London.  Two blocks from one of the bombings. 
[01:06:30]  As we were walking through and driving through the streets of the city,  it was remarkable how the people of London responded calmly, bravely.  What would you like them to do?  Freak out.  Hit one more.  Our hearts go out to them.  We feel a tremendous empathy with them.  I think every New Yorker would probably join me in saying that we feel very, very much,  you know, understand what you're going through.  No.  All right.  Not to take away from London. 
[01:07:00]  It's terrible what happened.  But there were 40 people killed.  It's a lot of people.  But 3,000 people, the two biggest buildings.  It's a different.  Buildings for people running for their lives away from, yeah.  And again, I'm not diminishing what happened in London because, I mean, it's one of the  only places I do like.  People's lies that'll, wow.  Yeah, I mean, you talk about 9-11.  I have a good friend that I grew up with.  He was all about New York, and he was in the towers for both, 93 and the other one. 
[01:07:30]  And he survived.  He's one of the lucky ones in a way.  And he hasn't been back in New York City since.  Yeah.  Yeah.  After that, you just leave.  He had an unbelievable life, you know, unbelievable across the board, you know.  And his life is destroyed.  The guy is just a mental case.  Absolute mental case.  Stop thinking people are chasing you.  Yeah.  And he hasn't stepped foot in Manhattan since and refuses to.  He used to be about working hard and partying hard and going home to his lovely wife and 
[01:08:00]  stuff.  And now he's just seeing psychologists around the clock, basically.  Wow.  Yeah, it fucks people up.  Completely destroyed.  I saw him, and it's beyond said, actually.  And he was one of the lucky ones.  Anthony, as we go to break, we have more to do on this, and a lot more to do, actually,  today.  We got Patrice coming in.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, and Keith.  And Keith Robinson.  That's going to be a lot of fun.  Carlos Messia checking in.  And Richard Huff, hopefully, will call in so we can talk about, you know, how the news 
[01:08:30]  handled this.  And he had a couple funny angles in the paper that we already discussed.  And is DeeDee coming in for the news today, Ben?  I believe so, yes.  You believe so?  I believe so.  That means no.  We haven't seen...  She's got interviews or something.  We haven't seen DeeDee in a while, so...  Keep everyone on hold.  I like Ben's shirt.  Do you?  Yeah, what's the matter with it, Jimmy?  What's the matter with it, Jim?  Nothing at all.  That shirt you have stinks.  I know it does.  Don't try to jump the gun and cut me off. 
[01:09:00]  Can you go one week without an Aussie or Black Sabbath t-shirt?  Nope.  How many do you have?  Yeah, how many do you have?  You must have a lot.  I have a good amount.  Not as many as you think.  No?  He's got three.  Maybe four.  Really?  That's it?  You always sleep in that long one when we're on the road.  Which one?  There's one long one.  Sexy.  How do you know, Ben?  Because I used to have to wake Jim up in Philly.  Night shirt like our gang.  Yeah.  Wear a long night shirt.  Jim comes out with his little mask on his head.  The room's all black.  I'm like Scrooge.  I have my night shirt and my night cap.  And your little goggles. 
[01:09:30]  What do you put?  Those little padded eye things over your face?  Well, I have to now because I don't have a...  Mrs. Kravitz or something?  No, like Michelle Pfeiffer.  Yeah.  In Scarface.  Right.  I'm going to sleep with them black jades.  I've got to sleep with them because I don't have a curtain in my room yet.  When are you getting one?  Very soon.  Is it going to be motorized?  No.  You should get one of those, dude.  Totally blacks out the thing and you could lay there in bed and just hit it.  That's my goal, by the way.  Not just to remain home.  Remain in bed. 
[01:10:00]  24 hours a day.  Where I could control everything with a remote control and people just bring me stuff.  That's not even joking.  You already have what?  You were saying the laptop's near the bed.  You have the really nice TV, I'm sure.  Yep.  Have the TV.  We discovered Peapod, Peapod.com.  They deliver the food to your house.  Jesus.  You don't have to go shopping.  It's like Fresh Direct, right?  Yeah.  They go to Waldbaum's and they get everything you need and deliver it. 
[01:10:30]  How great is that?  Drugstore.com for everything else.  Just go there, you get your little wipes and your toity paper and all of your aspirin and  anything else you need.  Then everything else I buy, like I'll go to Circuit City or BestBuy.com if I need electronics.  I used to go to Dell for computer equipment.  I'll talk about that later.  Customer service.  Dell, go fuck yourself. 
[01:11:00]  It's awful.  I used to crow.  Anyone in here can tell you how I used to crow about Dell.  I pushed Dell to everybody.  The Opie needed a computer.  He was like, what should I get?  I'm like, Dell, Dell, Dell.  Best computer.  You're going to get exactly what you want.  And their customer service is great.  Well, not anymore, people.  And not just because of one little incident.  Dell's customer service now is the worst customer service I have ever dealt with with any product 
[01:11:30]  I've ever had.  And this went from the best customer service I ever had probably a couple of years ago  to the absolute worst, cannot get anything accomplished, trying to order two fans.  I need two case ventilation fans for my Dell.  So we're talking about this now?  Yeah.  Yeah, because now I'm wound up.  Now I'm wound up.  Get me on the phone because I've got to take a leak.  I'm not even kidding.  I can continue.  I just got to leave.  You want to take a break?  Well, let's just get right on this, though, when we get back. 
[01:12:00]  All right.  No, I'm not even kidding.  My bladder's exploding.  All right.  I had the same problem, but there was a farmer in mine.  He stepped on your line.  Oh, he was going to the bathroom.  Hope he wasn't listening to you, Jimmy.  All right.  What happened?  I got to take a leak.  So would you have to call the bathroom?  No, I was going to call so we can continue doing the show.  Oh!  I didn't know what you were doing.  And I'd walk down the hall, listen to your babbling customer service crap.  All right.  You'd hear me leaking in the background, and then I'd walk back into the bathroom studio 
[01:12:30]  and continue.  No, you know, we got to help out the MiFi users by taking breaks.  Yeah, we really helped him out.  You know how they only got to rewind about an hour and 15 minutes?  Yeah.  And remind me to agree when you talk about Dell.  Right.  Please.  I'm reminding.  Ben, remind him to remind me to tell him that he agrees.  Oh, a little message.  Oh, a little message.  What was that, Opie?  I don't know.  Probably.  Remind people that XM customer service is great.  Shut up, Ilo. 
[01:13:00]  Shut up.  Once you remind us that Deep Tracks is doing a round-the-clock coverage on the subway bombings  in London.  They're going to go deep into the story.  Yeah.  Deep into the Jethro Tull catalog.  Catalog.  All right.  We'll talk about that when we get back.  Yeah, but you threw me off, though, really fast.  Yeah.  You were talking about how your goal is to just live in bed and stuff.  Yeah, sure.  And I had audio, actually, from your bathroom.  Oh, really?  From your bedroom. 
[01:13:30]  A bedroom, bathroom, if I can make that the same room.  Some room with a B.  That would be better.  The bitchin'.  See?  Bitchin'.  Oh, you.  My body temperature.  I have so much urine in me right now.  Does this ever happen to you?  You could feel your body temperature dropping?  Yeah.  Your water cooled.  Oh, my God.  I feel my whole body temperature dropping.  I'm going to pee for three straight minutes.  I want to massage you and just push down on your tummy.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Here's audio of Anthony in his bedroom as he lives his life exclusively in his bedroom. 
[01:14:00]  Come in with the milk.  Come in with the milk.  Come in with the milk.  Come in with the milk.  Come in with the milk.  Come in with the milk.  He is to open the bag with his right hand and hold the bag out to me at a 45-degree angle so I may reach into the bag without touching the paper.  And?  Well, it continues.  What's so odd about any of this?  It's funny you say and.  If there is any variation of these instructions, even to the smallest degree, the entire process must be repeated from the beginning. 
[01:14:30]  Exactly.  Come in with the milk.  Come in with the milk.  From the beginning.  Come in with the milk.  Come in with the milk.  From the beginning.  Come in with the milk.  Come in with the milk.  Come in with the milk.  Hello, exactly!  Anthony can totally relate.  That's the scary part.  What's wrong with that?  This was supposed to be a little cute gag.  I like that. 
[01:15:00]  Got one more clip of Anthony in his bedroom living his life.  Let's get a drink.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, honey.  You can't move.  You can't move.  You're safe here.  You're in the germ-free zone now.  You understand?  I have a germ-free zone in the house.  Everything else is taped off with, like, police tape.  Yeah.  Very good.  And you should just see.  You've got to come over one day, though, and look how neatly I have stacked my jars of urine.  I've lined them against the walls. 
[01:15:30]  Just golden jars of liquid all along the walls.  What was his reasoning for that?  There has to be a reason he had.  To save your urine?  Yeah.  Well, can we think about it as we take this leak?  Yeah, but I want to talk.  That's long overdue.  Howard Hughes.  All right, then just get me on the phone.  But Dell, Dell's customer service.  That's right.  Dell's.  Awful.  As we go to break, Leno did a pretty good job on the London subway bombings.  Listen to this.  Well, I want to take just a minute here to talk about the events that happened in London today.  As you all know, the terrible bombing they had there. 
[01:16:00]  And it's ironic.  I think it says, what, three days ago we celebrated our independence from England.  And then after, I think, the events of today, I don't think we could feel any more united with these people.  You know, we really have no greater friend or ally through war and peace, good times or bad.  And especially after September 11th.  They've always been there for us.  So I want everyone here in our audience and this stage, and I think all the folks behind the scenes, we just want our British friends to know our thoughts and prayers with them.  So we'll be right back right after this.  Yeah, I want to put a fuck you out of the Bruce Kelly, you fucking homo. 
[01:16:30]  You're a pretty good baby.  Yeah, this is Paul Waker.  Fuck you, Howard.  You're on fucking notice.  The boys get shot.  Don't make me a fucking maniac.  The boys get shot.  I'd like to give a double fuck you to my two big fat fucking bosses.  Two stupid fucking goomba motherfuckers with the two little tiny pricks. 
[01:17:00]  Fuck you and die.  Yeah, this is Stephen.  I want to give a big fuck you to Andrew Dice Clay.  Oh, boogaloo-galoo, boogaloo-galoo, boogaloo-galoo.  My career's fucking done now.  A douj.  Fuck you, you overrated prick.  Big fuck you to myself for bringing nothing to the FU line.  Fuck me.  Fuck you.  Call the opiate Anthony FU line at 1-866-FU-LINE-1.  1-866-FU-LINE-1.  Well, fuck you very much. 
[01:17:30]  Hey, hey, let's sit down and fire.  Ah, you're checking out the opiate Anthony program.  Oh, brother.  Spread the virus, people. 
[01:18:00]  Spread the virus.  Tell people that we're doing this fine radio program for XS Satellite Radio.  What's wrong, Anthony?  Uh, Hump X from Rhode Island.  Ant, you're a fucking tool.  You call yourself a hardcore gamer and you're recommending Dell?  If you have to recommend off-the-shelf systems, at least go with Falcon NW or Alienware, for fuck's sake.  Uh, dude, a lot of people don't have 13 Gs to spend on a computer, first of all.  I could if I wanted to.  I go through computers a lot.  So, uh, I get Dell, and they work fine for gaming. 
[01:18:30]  What do you think?  I'm getting the off-the-shelf fucking $600 model of Dell?  I build it.  I put in huge, uh, great video cards, a shitload of RAM.  Don't worry about it.  My computer's fine.  I have a problem with Dell's customer service.  Not their computers.  At least not yet.  Who knows what the hell's going on over there now.  Maybe their computers blow ass, too.  Because their customer service stinks.  They're doing what everybody is doing now.  Outsourcing.  This is a huge problem in, uh, this country.  Quickly, I was just going to say, does anyone's customer service work? 
[01:19:00]  Is it any, it's every customer service.  Customer service sucks now.  Uh, you, you, you, you end up on hold for hours on end when you try to make a phone call  to any of these people.  The menus take you on this, uh, if I could say wild goose chase.  It's like a wild goose chase.  And it used to be, but I guess they caught on to this.  It used to be at any time during the menu, you could hit that zero.  And wait for the live person. 
[01:19:30]  And get a real human being on the phone and say, here's my problem.  Here's the help I need.  Maybe, you know, your menu didn't give the option that I needed.  But not anymore.  That's not even an option anymore.  If the mechanical person online can't help you, you are fucked.  And Dell is now the worst.  They sent, uh, all their customer service over to India.  Just like everyone else.  Microsoft.  A lot of the airlines, customer service is based over there.  A lot of tech stuff.  All based over in India. 
[01:20:00]  They train these people.  I saw a whole show on it.  How they train these Indians to try to sound, uh, American.  They try to give them this generic American accent, uh, so, so as to fool the people that  are trying to call them.  They, I'm sorry.  They're not up on what's going on.  Maybe they're good at, uh, hiding their Indian accent.  But, uh, they're not learning the product.  These people have scripts they work from.  They have these, these things that if you have problem A, it's like a flow chart. 
[01:20:30]  Uh, if you are confronted with a caller that has problem A, go C, B, or C. If it's B, now  C, D, E. It just goes down the line.  The best is, uh, throwing, throwing them off their script.  Yeah.  Like, I was on customer service for my, uh, my banking.  I'll get into my problem after yours because you started this.  But, uh, it starts with a guy.  I finally got a guy after being stuck in the menu system for a long time.  And like you said, uh, so many people caught on that you could just push zero to get a  live voice that they basically have taken that option out of the game. 
[01:21:00]  But eventually I did get a live voice.  I don't even know how.  I couldn't even tell you.  And the guy's like, hi, um, what is your social security number?  And I'm like, no, no, no, no.  I need to talk to, you know, hi, what is your, like, they didn't know what to do.  Because I didn't start with step one on their little script.  You went out of step.  And I'm like, no, I'm not giving your social security.  But, but, but before, what is your social security?  They couldn't even improvise or anything.  No.  They didn't know what to do. 
[01:21:30]  You're not getting a real person.  You're getting a computer because it's, it's some guy with a script.  Right.  That he can't deviate from.  You're getting a, a meat machine.  Oh, who's calling?  I'll call.  Somebody calling?  Who would call Opie during the show?  Wouldn't they know you do a show?  Hey.  Oh, hi, Carmen.  How are you?  Oh, it's Carmen.  Are you calling me too early?  No, I'm usually up this early. 
[01:22:00]  Who is that?  Citibank.  It's Citibank.  It's Citibank.  This is just what you were talking about.  At least you get a call back.  Okay.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Account number what?  Okay.  How many millions?  What?  Yeah, well, just send my checks.  Oh.  I need my, make sure they send my checks. 
[01:22:30]  You want a check?  Oh, I already, I already checked, uh, two months ago.  What address are they going to?  Uh-oh.  Uh, first time.  What's your routing number?  A little Panem stickers on them?  Uh, yes.  Yes, yes.  Yeah.  All right, thank you.  Anything, just call her.  I'm sure she'll be easy to get in touch with, too, after 50,000 menu prompts. 
[01:23:00]  Did they just hear my address over the radio, too?  I didn't hear it.  I didn't hear it.  Jesus.  That's exactly, that's exactly, there's Pat Battle.  That's exactly what we were talking about.  That took three days to close, uh, an old account.  Three days.  And it's finally done?  Ah, you'll see.  Supposedly.  Supposedly.  Well, go ahead, sorry, Anthony.  So, uh, yeah, Dell, I used to just say it was the best thing ever, and customer service  was great.  If I ever had a problem, I would call them, get a live person, and they would deal with  it, uh, immediately. 
[01:23:30]  Now, uh, the beginning of June, um, one of the fans in my computer started making a noise.  I opened it up.  I was getting this fan warning thing, saying that there was a defective fan.  So I opened it up, and, uh, one of the blades broke off of the fan.  So I figured I'd get two new fans and replace both the fans that are in there.  Call up Dell, uh, and through, like, all kinds of prompts.  There's no way, I, there's no numbers on there. 
[01:24:00]  I tried it through the website.  You cannot find this fan on their website, because God forbid they backlog any, uh, equipment  that you might need, like, three months ago.  It's all about their new computer, their new stuff, and anything old, go fuck yourself.  You're not getting a part for this thing.  So I, I, I did get somebody live on the phone.  It was an Indian guy, uh, and I don't even remember how I did it.  I've tried to do it again, to get a live person on the phone.  I can't do it.  So I had this live guy on the phone, and I, I told him my model number of the computer 
[01:24:30]  and everything, and ordered these fans.  He had such a problem understanding what I needed, and how to go about ordering it.  Uh, and I knew there was going to be a problem right then and there, because this had never  happened with Dell before.  So I had to be satisfied, all right?  He took the order.  Also, they had my old Brooklyn address.  He goes, we're sending it to, blah, blah, blah, said, my old Brooklyn.  I said, no, I have a new address.  Take this down.  And I said, please, I, I want an email confirmation of this entire transaction. 
[01:25:00]  No problem, Mr. Kumia, that will be sent out to you.  Everything will be fine.  I never got an email verification.  Uh, so I figured, what the hell?  I just waited, waited.  I, I finally checked my order status.  You get your little order number, and you can check your order status.  I check it.  It says, orders canceled.  I go, what?  I didn't, what?  So now I try to get the live guy on the phone again.  You're playing with.  To no avail.  God, you're, go ahead, sorry.  To no avail. 
[01:25:30]  Could not get the live person.  So they have this feature called live chat.  We were able to chat with a customer service guy.  On a computer, right?  Yeah.  So I get on there, and, and me.  I bet you're using the C key a lot.  Oh, boy.  And the F key.  The M or F-er key.  The M, F key should be right next to each other.  Is it?  Oh.  I should have checked before I did my little check.  Yes.  Okay, they're not next to each other.  Then you'll get, it is stupid.  Right.  Fuckers.  So I'm chatting with this guy and saying, look, I never got the confirmation. 
[01:26:00]  Now they're telling me the order's canceled.  And, of course, the first thing they do is apologize profusely for this problem that you're having,  and we will take care of it.  And he said, we have made a new order.  It should ship.  You should receive this on June 28th.  Like, okay, I can take it.  Meanwhile, my computer sounds like a 767 warming up to take off because it's on one fan.  And I'm playing pretty graphic-intensive games, so the thing is really heating up. 
[01:26:30]  I know I'm just going to blow the thing up.  So I wait and wait.  I get no email confirmation again.  I go to check my order status.  It says it's in the assembly phase of the whole thing.  Assembly phase.  When you order a computer, you go to Dell to check the status.  They have pre-order, order, assembly, inspection, boxing.  Like, you could check the whole, every step of the way.  If you're ordering a part, there is no assembly part. 
[01:27:00]  There is no assembly.  It's done.  Put the fucking fan in the box and send it to me.  Well, this went on and on and on and on.  Past June 28th.  So then I try again to call, no avail.  I get on the chat again.  And each time you're starting brand new.  No one knows what the hell you're talking about.  There's no history there.  I try to convey to the guy what's been happening.  Well, okay, I'll check with shipping and I will email you.  I go, don't.  And now I'm cursing.  I'm like, don't bullshit me. 
[01:27:30]  You guys are liars.  I go, I've been lied to by your customer service department.  I will email you when I speak to shipping.  Never got an email.  Again, nothing.  And this went on.  Now, yesterday, I completely fed up.  Check the status again.  It's still in assembly.  Oh, my goodness.  Yeah.  And this is, I've been on the chat and email.  So I took the original email I got and replied to that.  I hit reply and just said, you guys, I am livid.  I cannot deal with it.  You're the worst customer service ever. 
[01:28:00]  Please, I need these parts.  You think saying that you're livid is going to matter?  No, it doesn't do anything.  Okay, good.  So I get the email last night.  It says, Mr. Kumia, we are very sorry that you have had a problem with this.  We will ship your camera as quickly as possible.  Yes, I just said camera.  And now I'm reading this.  I start laughing my ass off.  I'm ordering a fucking ventilation fans. 
[01:28:30]  Two fans.  A camera and some mysterious bracket item that they're sending me.  That they're going to give me free of charge, they said.  The bracket, not the camera.  And they said, here is where we're shipping it.  And what do you think the address was?  Brooklyn?  My old Brooklyn address.  You just want to throw the computer out the window.  At this point, I'm scared to open up my own mail because the simplest tasks cause you the biggest headaches now. 
[01:29:00]  This should be easy.  This is a part that obviously it's in their computers.  They know what the part is.  Send it out to me.  As soon as you see that there's a little problem, they give you a number to call.  You know you're in.  Screwed.  Hopefully just a day of hell.  But usually, no.  It's days or an aunt's case over a month.  Over a month.  And now I just got this one.  Here it is.  Mr. Cumia, thank you for contacting Dell Online Customer Care.  Whoa.  And now the first thing is exactly what I've gotten. 
[01:29:30]  I swear to you, this is probably my eighth email I've gotten from them that says,  I sincerely apologize for any miscommunication on our part and for the inconvenience this matter has caused.  I truly regret that we are not able to provide you with an experience that was completely satisfactory to you.  This is just garbage.  This is the, yeah, the standard patch friggin' bullshit response that they give you.  Now, this is obviously somebody who isn't English or doesn't speak English. 
[01:30:00]  They put down, please be advised that your order number for Dell Assembly Bracket is being delayed for a long time.  This order is delayed as our revenue department did not process it due to some technical reasons.  What?  What does that mean?  So I have canceled this order.  They canceled it again.  Wait, this is just a brand new email right here?  Yeah, brand new right here.  Oh, my God. 
[01:30:30]  So we have canceled as our revenue department did not process it.  I have also placed a new order for Assembly Bracket absolutely free of cost to you.  So your order number is, there's a new one, it will be shipped to you within three days,  within the next three to five business days, to the following address.  Shore Road, Brooklyn, New York.  They are, I gotta jump in because they are fucking, I went through this about three months ago  where I didn't have my desktop for a month and a half because I had a problem with the electrical thing. 
[01:31:00]  They sent me a new, the same thing, fucking Indians who, not people in this country,  they don't speak English, what you gotta do is take, can I have your name, please?  I take down every name and I reference it to the next person.  I spoke to Dorothy.  It's Representative 77888 Satyendra.  It's one name.  There isn't even a last name here.  It's Satyendra.  Dell, if there's anybody that subscribes to XN, that listens, that has anything to do with Dell, 
[01:31:30]  you're killing your business.  The business is dying.  Your computer business is dying.  I went to the Dell forums last night.  On their website, they have the forums.  Nothing but complaint after complaint, the same things that are happening to me.  You're saving money by outsourcing to India and you're losing customers in droves.  You are losing so much more than you are saving by outsourcing.  You're destroying your reputation and destroying your company. 
[01:32:00]  When that commercial for Dell comes on where the guy is in bed and he's paranoid over customer service  and when it's going to be available and he goes, what about Christmas Day?  And the guy is sitting there with the headphone on and the Dell office is going, we'll be here.  He goes, what about Easter?  Easter, we'll be here, sir.  And it's some American kid sitting there in an American office building.  Bullshit!  You're full of shit, Dell.  And I, you know, and everybody says, I will not buy another Dell product.  But this is one of the instances where it's not a personal thing where I'm saying, I'm not going to buy a Dell. 
[01:32:30]  They're forcing me not to.  If I'm having this problem for a fan, why am I going to buy a new computer and, God forbid,  have a problem with that and be stuck without a computer?  Dude, I had the woman telling me to take my computer apart.  This Indian woman is telling me, you have to unscrew the back, sir.  I'm like, I am not fucking removing the back from my computer.  It's not happening.  It's not happening.  They are ruining it.  And this is just, it's part of a bigger story with customer service. 
[01:33:00]  They are destroying their reputations by outsourcing to India.  It's a great idea.  Who had this idea?  Who was the first motherfucking corporate ass dick that came up with this idea?  Guys, I got a proposition.  We put all of our customer service people in India.  Why am I talking like a 1930s movie?  We'll put it all in India.  Wonderful.  Wonderful.  Motherfuckers.  And you cannot get anything done anymore.  Nothing.  They are absolutely, I had to go through XM, because XM has some kind of a deal with Dell or whatever. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, really?  There's something going on with XM and Dell.  Something going on.  It's a huge deal, actually.  Okay, whatever it is.  They do Elo's haircuts.  Yes.  Is that it?  They send Indian people with Down syndrome.  Well, you know something?  You know something?  It would be nice, Dan, if I had a nice Dell experience that I could then get on XM and tell people that it's a wonderful thing.  But I'm not going to lie just because there's a relationship there.  These people have fucked me.  Basically, Dell has this thing with XM where every computer is set for XM radio, and the icon's right on the screen. 
[01:34:00]  Kevin barely got me a name of a guy I went through.  American guy, a corporate guy who works in the Dell offices who actually helped me out.  I think his name was Chad.  Helped me out a lot.  And then he actually called back to follow up.  But their customer service is despicable.  Great.  And that works for you or me when I get a hold of that guy because give me his number.  He's going to hear something from me.  But what about the average Joe out there?  Exactly.  Jimmy, that doesn't have access to one of the real American executives. 
[01:34:30]  Despicable.  Proof of poor customer service from Sarah Ross, Anthony.  Dell Complaints.  I guess she read an article on how bad customer service is.  Yeah.  And she writes, I would have to say that article is correct.  I'm a new Dell owner of probably four months and have already had to deal with Dell's supposedly superior customer service.  Let's just say the experience I had, I was less than impressed with.  I called Dell concerning a problem I was and still am having with my computer.  At this time, my computer was only three months old.  I had heard before about how bad Dell's customer service was, but I thought, how bad can it really be? 
[01:35:00]  Right.  So I called, and I don't remember having too long a wait.  When the lady came on the line, though, I would say that she definitely was just learning English.  Yeah.  I could barely understand a word she was saying.  It was the most frustrating conversation I had ever had in my life.  She was unable to fix my problem and actually ended up getting me to take something of my computer, my antivirus system. 
[01:35:30]  There's a typo somewhere there.  I guess, what?  What?  She had a problem?  For what reason, I don't know.  By the end of the conversation, I was nearly in tears because I was so frustrated at the fact that I couldn't understand her.  So that is my experience with Dell, blah, blah, blah.  It is such a frustrating thing because you're stuck.  First, you're stuck in that automated loop that you get in where you're trying to hit the buttons and get somebody.  Or the worst would you get disconnected when you've gone through it for eight minutes, and then all of a sudden a fucking dial tone comes up or you hear nothing. 
[01:36:00]  You hear click, click, and then you hear nothing, and you're still holding, and you're like, did I hear a hang-up click?  You wait and wait, and then all of a sudden, yeah, bam.  Do-do-do-do, like recording.  It really is a bigger problem.  Most people just have a horrible experience with customer service.  People don't know about this yet because we recorded for that 6 a.m. hour, but I was opening my mail on the air live yesterday.  Yes, you were.  While we were taping, I should say.  And I got a bill from EasyPass.  I don't have EasyPass because I don't drive. 
[01:36:30]  I got to get it, obviously.  No, you don't have EasyPass because you're lazy, and you should get EasyPass.  There's no reason you shouldn't have it.  Probably, you're right.  You live in New York.  So I went through an EasyPass toll.  It was the George Washington Bridge.  This was a very interesting thing.  They have an upper level and a lower level.  And at the last minute, I saw a sign.  It's the truth.  It happened to a ton of people that day where it said, I think it was upper level, upper level closed for cash customers.  So basically, if you have EasyPass, you can go that way.  Right.  I should have realized there was a problem because there was probably a 10-mile backup on the lower level. 
[01:37:00]  But I'm looking at upper level going, wow, this is great.  And at the last second when it was too late, I saw, they probably warned me before, but I wasn't paying attention.  They said, we're only accepting EasyPass on the upper level or whatever.  Yeah.  So now it's too late.  So now I actually go through where you do pay for cash, but there's no one at the booth.  So I sit there for a second and I go through. 
[01:37:30]  Okay.  And a ton of people did the exact same thing.  I wasn't the only dummy.  And then finally a cop, because everyone is kind of waiting at the cash lane.  It's like, why isn't anyone taking our cash?  A cop on the loudspeaker, you should have read the signs.  You should have read the signs.  Basically want to say, tough shit.  Go through EasyPass and get fined.  Yep.  So I went on my merry way there and I finally opened the mail yesterday, as you heard.  Yes, I saw.  And, well, they got me for not paying the toll, obviously. 
[01:38:00]  And what's the toll for the GWB these days?  Six dollars, I guess.  Six bucks?  So you had to send in six dollars, I would assume.  Well, I wish it was that easy.  Oh, really?  It's not that easy?  So six dollar toll?  You didn't do anything extra?  Why?  Six dollar toll plus twenty-five dollar administrative fee.  Twenty-five dollar administrative fee.  So now it's up to thirty-one dollars.  Thirty-one bucks to go across the GWB.  But then you got to times that by two because I violated this situation twice. 
[01:38:30]  You went around again and you drove through again?  So now there's another problem.  So then they show another violation that happens six seconds later.  Wait, because they are timed.  Yes.  So it showed one violation.  Yeah.  And then another one six seconds after that.  Six seconds right there.  You can see it for yourself.  Same toll and everything.  Oh, that's wonderful.  I apologize to the EasyPass people that I took my Learjet through the tolls.  Wow.  That's something.  So now two violations. 
[01:39:00]  Initial toll, six dollars.  Twenty-five dollar administrative fee.  So that's thirty-one.  And then again, six dollars plus twenty-five dollars administrative fee.  Sixty-two bucks.  Sixty-two dollars.  That's an expensive little bridge crossing.  And then it says make checks or money orders payable to blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  And then, of course, customer service.  One-800.  Go fuck yourself.  So now you call it up.  So I called one-800.  Go fuck yourself.  And spent the next hour off and on trying to solve this problem. 
[01:39:30]  Waiting on hold.  Finally going into the menu.  The menu didn't help me.  Then being hung up on.  Just like everything we were just talking about.  Finally get this lady on the phone.  I'm like, I was charged twice.  In six seconds.  I was charged twice.  And they're like, oh, that happens.  That happens.  There's a glitch in the system.  I'm like, all right.  Here's my account number or whatever.  Can you just take off one of the charges?  So let's just get that out of the way.  Nah, can't do that. 
[01:40:00]  Why?  It was your error.  It's got to be on the screen in front of you.  Yeah, if you have the sheet in front of you and you're looking at it.  Right.  She's got it in front of her on a computer terminal.  She doesn't can't do that.  You're going to have to write in.  You're going to have to write a letter.  No, I'm talking to you, though.  Right.  I'm like, what do you mean write a letter?  I'm actually talking to you.  Just hit some keys.  You could solve this.  You could see for yourself it was your error and solve the fucking error.  Yeah.  No, you have to write a letter and circle where they charge you twice with the time and everything 
[01:40:30]  and blah, blah, blah.  Oh, my God.  This is why our taxes are so high.  I'm like, right.  You're looking at the same screen I am.  Well, you know, I got the paper form of this thing.  Oh, man.  So, dude, I was, as we like to say in the show, stupefied.  Yep.  And I wasn't getting anywhere.  So, all of a sudden, you know what I did?  The frustration level was just growing inside me and I'm heating up.  I just didn't say a word.  You just stopped talking.  I just stopped talking.  For 30 or 40 seconds, my brain was just like short-circuiting. 
[01:41:00]  I didn't know what to do.  What was she doing?  And she's just waiting and I hear her breathing.  She wasn't talking either?  I hear her breathing.  Just uncomfortable silence.  She's breathing and I'm not talking and all of a sudden she had to go 40 seconds later  because I guess they're not really allowed to hang up on you.  No.  And she just goes, hello?  I'm like, yeah, I'm still here.  I was just a defeated man.  I'm still here.  Yeah.  And then I was silent again.  She's like, hello?  And I'm like, yeah. 
[01:41:30]  Did you fix it?  During our silence together, did you work on that and fix it for me?  And I'm like, well, I don't have a checking account because you just heard that.  I don't have checks to my new account.  And I don't feel like getting a stupid money order for a $6 toll.  Because they are going to waive the administrative fee as long as it's 15 business days.  But I have to write that in the letter.  Of course you do.  So I just hang up on her. 
[01:42:00]  Hang up.  And I just ripped the part down where you have to submit with your payment.  And I just take a $5 bill, a $1 bill, circled, said, you sent cash.  Fuck yeah.  I said, charge me twice and mailed it in.  And let them deal with it.  You're going to get, mm-hmm.  Your form is going in the garbage.  That $6 is going in someone's pocket.  And you are fucked.  Well, we'll see what happens.  You might as well send it to KFC because that's where it's going.  Some fatso is having lunch on your dime. 
[01:42:30]  That's probably why you have to do the money orders and the checks.  So they have a record, right?  Five, taping quarters to a box top.  Dude, if I could have got away with it, I would have given them $6 worth of pennies.  Six bucks in cash you sent.  Yeah.  And you know that it's just, you know who works there.  You know who opens those letters.  Somebody who could really use the six bucks.  So basically, though, some stupid thing that obviously I should have picked up on at the time. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  But I didn't and a lot of people didn't.  It's now this thing.  That should have been taken care of, though, on the phone.  Right.  You obviously could not have gone through the same toll within six seconds.  They see it in front of her.  Exact toll.  At least that one should have been wiped out right there with her at the same time.  Yeah, they've got a code and everything.  It's the same code for the same.  It's obviously there.  So this stupid little thing that should have been nothing is now, now it's a problem.  That's what customer service is now.  Stupid little thing, should be nothing, big problem. 
[01:43:30]  You know what the beauty of being on the radio is?  And this is because I hate these people so far.  When Dell, you want to bite somebody's face, is that we're on in 50 states.  You figure there's a lot of people that buy computers.  If you can just get five people in every state, five, to not buy a Dell, I average it out.  That's 250 people in the country, say, for a year.  Yeah.  How much is a computer?  800 bucks?  Yeah, I average it.  More than that, probably, some of them.  But if it's 800 bucks a computer, that's $200,000.  There you go. 
[01:44:00]  It costs you, you shitheads.  That's what you get.  Yeah, because your stupid customer service cost-cutting measures.  Five people in every state decide to buy something else.  All right, let's calm down, because I like Dell.  Dell has to get up to $46,000 for me to make some money back.  Good luck.  I like Dell.  Buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy.  Screw them, man.  And I've been buying Dells for years, man.  Years.  Every year, at least, I buy another Dell computer.  And they're just screwing me here. 
[01:44:30]  And by the way, because I only spoke in code when the phone rang earlier, I'm just trying  to close a joint account out, a joint checking account.  Uh-oh.  40 large in there?  Nah, I lucked out, actually.  A little overdrawing was going on.  But besides that, that should have been...  How long do you think it should take to close out an old checking account?  To close a bank account?  How about, could you close this account?  How long was that?  Three seconds?  Dude, I'm up to three days already. 
[01:45:00]  Three days?  I'm up to three days.  Something, like I said, these simple tasks that we all have to deal with are just becoming  nightmares on a daily basis for everybody.  It's like, yeah, it should have been one call.  Three days.  Had to wait for checks to clear.  Had to wait for activity at ATM.  Machines.  You have to wait 24 hours for that.  And then finally, yesterday, when it was supposed to be all done, they go, oh, we closed the  wrong account.  Oh, good.  My new checking account that has my cash in it.  Uh-oh. 
[01:45:30]  Is that the one?  Now, what about the checks that went out on that account?  Did you have any checks?  Outstanding?  I don't know.  They'll probably bounce.  Yeah, well, so they closed that account.  I'm like, all right, well, no big deal, right?  Well, yeah, it is.  Now, you've got to wait 24 hours before you can have that checking account back.  Oh, great.  Thank you for the inconvenience.  Right.  Thank you.  Something that should have taken two minutes is up to three days.  Three days.  You just want to.  Three days.  Oh.  And then I, you know, I actually owe Club Sort of Kenny money and stuff, and I've got 
[01:46:00]  to write them a check, you know?  I haven't had checks.  I ordered checks probably two months ago.  I still don't have them.  I finally called them, and they're like, oh, we forgot to check that box when you were  in here.  I just ordered checks, by the way, and my order was canceled.  You know why?  The address I gave was not the same address that my bank account has.  I checked my bank account. 
[01:46:30]  It's the same address.  I get a letter yesterday from my bank saying, well, we've changed your address.  Here it is.  And now it's got my new address.  I've been at my new address for a year, and I've given my address to them.  They've had it on file.  I've written checks.  I've used my card.  I've put the address on it.  But for some reason, there is such shit going on out there.  I don't know what happened.  I think corporate America just lost their mind. 
[01:47:00]  They're trying so hard to save money.  Dude, it happens around here.  I mean, we're doing a dumb radio show.  There was so much paperwork involved.  We've talked about that as far as the show goes.  But in general, you know, in general, it's like, well, to do this, have them fill out this form, this form, and this, and this, and then check this, this, and this.  And if these aren't all checked, then he should fill out this form.  They just have made and invented way too many forms where there's anywhere along the way something can happen that fucks up the whole thing.  And it does. 
[01:47:30]  Right.  They made it too complicated, too many hands in there, and they're trying to make it cheaper.  It doesn't work.  That outsourcing is destroying customer service.  Just wrecking it.  You know, it's pretty good, and I know they outsource.  I think they outsource anyway.  Does Mac outsource?  Does anybody know?  Apple?  I really don't know.  No?  The compatible shit that they have.  You know what?  Yeah.  Well, people have asked, why don't you have a Mac?  I have a Mac. 
[01:48:00]  I use Mac for graphics and video and stuff like that.  But their website's great.  You go to their website.  You want an answer to something?  You can find it easily.  You need a product.  You could order it online through a Mac, and it's great.  Unfortunately, I like to play games other than, like, the five that are available for fucking Mac.  So I have to have my Windows.  If they were more compatible, I'd probably get one, because they are good for graphics and stuff like that.  You know something?  You can't just have a Mac.  You need a Mac and a Windows.  It's just the world we live in if you're into graphics and stuff. 
[01:48:30]  All right.  Let's go to the phone here.  Terry in Philly.  Go ahead, Terry.  Hey, boys.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hi.  Terry the guy.  How are you, guys?  Hey, I called XM last Saturday.  I was riding in my car.  I got a bunch of XM accounts.  One of them's in my car.  A lot of them are in my cars, and one's in my computer at home.  So I'm enjoying live.  You know, it's pretty cool.  You go from channel to channel.  You listen to stadium to stadium.  Yeah, they really did a great job with the coverage, by the way.  Unbelievable.  Excellent on the regular, you know, car radio.  So I go home.  I'm excited.  The wife's away.  The kids are away.  I'm going to join myself on my laptop, listen to XM. 
[01:49:00]  Here, they don't have it on the computer for some reason.  So I call up customer service.  I get some Hindu or some dancer.  She doesn't know what the hell is going on.  She says, oh, I don't know what's going on.  I said, well, why don't you know?  And then I said to them, I said, well, why don't you have all the channels on XM on your computer?  She didn't know any answer to that.  So that, Eric Logan's listening.  Does he think if I spend like 50 bucks a month or 60 bucks a month on all these computers,  for an extra six bucks, wouldn't I want to have all the channels on my laptop?  Like, isn't that the stupid...  Like, you talk about these radio guys.  Isn't he pretty stupid? 
[01:49:30]  Nah, Elo's actually pretty smart.  Well, isn't that pretty dumb, though, that you don't have that on your laptop?  Most guys use their laptop for their music systems, right?  It's funny, stupid me.  I did call XM customer service to get one of my XM units, you know, activated.  Oh, my God.  I'm trying to...  I'm like, dude, I'm Opie from the Opie and Anthony show.  We're pretty much on every box right now.  You go to Best Buy right now, you see my name.  Yeah.  It's right...  It's one of the highlights of the whole system. 
[01:50:00]  I'm that guy.  And I still couldn't get anything done.  I could not get my unit activated.  I'm like, I'm Opie...  So he calls in and guess what my head is.  He calls in.  And the funny thing is, the person, you know, she didn't even know the name of the show.  And, you know, and I'm not expecting that, but when we're on every box, you would think,  hello, if you're working for the company, you might know the product.  Or might want another product.  This lady did no shit, so...  So I had to give up. 
[01:50:30]  The ladies get the bombs.  The ladies get the bombs.  All right.  Thank you.  We have Beyond Frustrated.  It says, recently I had a cell phone company return my check because my account was on hold.  My account was on hold because I didn't pay my bill.  They can't accept a payment until the hold is removed.  To remove the hold, you must make a full payment.  That is...  That's perfect.  It's a perfect example.  I'm talking about the simple tasks.  That'd become just a complete nightmare. 
[01:51:00]  Pain in the ass.  And I guess Apple doesn't outsource customer service.  Good.  Very good.  Hope they keep it that way.  Because I know Microsoft does.  Or another one that you'll get friggin' India.  Why'd they pick India?  Who...  I don't know.  It's just a cheap, filthy labor.  Is that what it is?  I'm Dorothy.  No, you're not.  Stop it.  Hello.  My name is Pete.  No, it's not.  It is not Pete.  It's Sanji.  Here's a rule of thumb.  When I'm getting computer help, I don't want the person helping me to have come to work 
[01:51:30]  on a yak.  If you rode livestock to work, I don't want you helping me with my fucking computer.  With some futuristic device like a computer.  Oh, that's hilarious.  If I eat a burger and you're probably going to worship it, you're not qualified to help  me.  Let's see.  Let's go to John.  Go ahead, John.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, John.  Hi, John.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi.  Hey, just so you know, people are getting fucking speeding tickets sent to them for easy pass 
[01:52:00]  for going between the tolls too fast.  I got a friend of mine who got a fucking ticket for going five miles over between two fucking  tolls.  I heard about that, but I don't believe it.  No, they do do it.  I don't know.  I don't believe it.  I've heard about it and heard that it's possible and stuff, but they're not doing that yet.  Well, this morning's a ticket he got, he showed me a picture.  I've got warnings going through the toll booth too quickly, but not from point A to point  B too fast.  I've been yelled at by the fucking guys, where you whiz right through.  Like, especially in New York, they have the gates still at the toll booths. 
[01:52:30]  I don't know why they have those frigging things.  Pull them out.  Jersey, no gates.  You just go.  But they have the gates.  And I like the thing to actually skim my windshield wiper when I go through.  I like the gate to come up and actually touch my windshield wiper as I zip right through.  And I have just been yelled at by the cops.  I'm fully expecting that to happen, though, where they just start mailing speeding tickets  in the mail.  Yeah.  It's possible.  What a moneymaker that will be.  If they know how many miles it is between point A and point B, and you have a record of 
[01:53:00]  when you cross those two points, they could absolutely get your speed.  I fully expect that to happen.  It would just wreck the easy pass system, though, because people would stop using it.  And they haven't started doing that yet.  That would be a huge story.  And believe me, they'd be handing out tickets.  Everyone would get one.  I'd have 50 tickets.  Jimmy in Staten Island.  Yo.  Oh, hey.  Hey.  Jimmy.  How you doing, guys?  Two things.  First of all, never underestimate the power of the cycle factor.  And number two, I'm the guy that's called Fat Nick is Escalade. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, yeah?  Yes, I am.  Good boy.  Yeah?  Well, yeah.  Yeah, it came with the Cuisine package with the heated seats memory package and the Louisville  plugger.  Punch it up.  Oh, boy.  Let's go to Howard Beach.  Mikey.  Yo.  What's up, Mikey?  Yo, I bought a laptop from Dell.  And the bucket thing crashed.  I called up Dell customer service.  And I got some sand nigger on the phone.  Oh, jeez.  Well, wait, wait, wait.  Hold it, Mike.  Hold it. 
[01:54:00]  Where are you from?  Howard Beach.  All right.  That makes perfect sense now.  I had a look and see where you were from before I could.  I wasn't sure if it was Boston or Howard Beach.  Yeah.  Thanks for correcting us.  That's great.  You're really busting apart those stereotypes there, Mike.  Yeah, right.  So, you know, they have me on there for like two hours.  Do this.  Do that.  Reload this.  Reboot that.  Call me back.  I do all the things.  I call him back.  The fucking thing crashed.  Then I finally get a white guy on.  I thought that I was going to get something with him.  He did the same thing. 
[01:54:30]  Over and over and over and over again.  I got so fucking frustrated.  I had the thing for like three months.  And I said, you know what?  Just give me my fucking money back.  I was paying it off.  And I said, just give me my money back.  Fuck this.  Give me my money.  I took it.  I just use it now to just beach spooks over the fucking head with it when they come into  our neighborhood, huh?  That's about what it was good for.  Gee.  How are things over there in Howard Beach, Mike?  Yeah, they're cool.  Yeah.  I got shopping over here doing marches.  You're driving around with any words of support on your car? 
[01:55:00]  No, no, no.  I don't have any soap written on my window.  Have you seen any?  What?  Any words of support written on other people's cars?  Oh, yeah.  A couple.  Like what?  Oh, you know, the same old free fat Nick and that type of shit.  Yeah.  Anyway, I'll punch it out.  Have fun over there.  Jesus Christ.  Howard Beach.  A couple more, then we'll break here.  Eric in Colorado.  Eric?  Morning, boys.  Morning, Eric.  Morning.  I can top all your customer service bitches. 
[01:55:30]  Two years ago, my pickup, I was in a minor accident, and one of the brackets for my grill  guard got bit.  I have been waiting two fucking years for new brackets.  Why?  Because they have sent me, four times they've sent me the wrong brackets.  I finally told them, I gave them everything correct.  I even sent the guy the original bracket so he knew what I was talking about, and they 
[01:56:00]  still, not only did they return the bit brackets, but the new brackets were still the wrong  brackets.  I finally had to take and go and have new brackets, custom made.  It cost me $1,000 to have four brackets, custom made.  I only paid $300 for the grill guard to begin with.  See?  It has been a long, drawn-out, and the worst part about it is-  Oh, my God.  Sounds like I'm on customer service with this guy.  The company is in America.  The technical and customer support guy is in America. 
[01:56:30]  He speaks perfect English.  Yeah, but how many times did you actually send back and forth with the brackets?  Shut up, Jimmy.  Jimmy.  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  But, Eric.  Hey, Harry T. made a little something-something for the show.  Was he requesting it?  As we go to break, I guess.  Don't call him Harry T.  Patrice is going to enter the program next.  Oh!  Patrice O'Neal.  And an old friend, Carlos Mencia, checking in today, I think.  Really?  And no Keith Robinson. 
[01:57:00]  No?  I don't know why.  Patrice knows.  Patrice knows.  Okay, we'll find out.  Patrice knows.  I never met Carlos.  No?  No, he's not coming in.  No, I know.  Of course not.  I've never met him.  We'll never see him again.  He's got a show on Comedy Central now.  Hello, Carlos.  He doesn't have to come in anymore.  It's beyond that.  We understand the game.  We know how these things work.  We understand the game.  All right.  So, Harry T., you know, Bruce Kelly crying over The Who for the faithful listeners.  Yes.  During the Live 8 coverage.  During Live 8, he was covering the show from London. 
[01:57:30]  And, well, The Who came on.  You know what?  We should play the original clip just to bring everyone up to speed.  We got all emotional.  We're getting new subscribers every day to this XM satellite radio.  Just set up, Anthony.  I'm sorry I interrupted you there.  That's all right.  You could pretty much listen to it.  You got emotional when The Who got on stage.  Yeah, listen to this.  This is Bruce Kelly.  He was supposed to be a broadcast professional.  And this is how he sounded that day. 
[01:58:00]  Is this live?  Yes, we're live.  Bruce, where were you, buddy?  I was right up under the phone logs.  You know, it's amazing watching Pete Townsend and Roger Daltrey perform these songs after  all these years and still have the full spirit of what they do under control.  I mean, you know, Townsend just continues to be an amazing guitar player.  I'm sorry.  I'm absolutely crying.  I can't help it.  I really can't.  This is no fake.  You know, the whole moment just kind of got to me with that video. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, the video was very powerful.  Yeah, yeah, that was...  This is very awkward.  I'm sorry.  But it was just very...  I mean, you know, it's just The Who.  You know, I can't help but be a 14-year-old kid out there with The Who.  And that's it.  I'm sorry.  You were seeing them live.  I guess that was in color?  Yeah.  Yeah, they were live on stage, but the black and white was happening on the big screen too.  Yeah.  Through your tears.  Wow.  So there's two more to go here. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, at Hyde Park and the crowd.  You're like an idiot.  I'm sorry, really.  No, no.  It's just overwhelming.  That's what this...  You know, that really is what this is all about.  There are certain moments that touch everybody.  Yeah.  We love that audio.  I got a call.  Two people out, though.  George Taylor Morris, who I love.  Yeah.  He's one of these guys that is legendary.  His voice is just legendary.  He's been around forever, and he's a great broadcaster.  And also Emma, who I don't know much about, but she does a good job for XM as well.  They let Bruce off the hook. 
[01:59:30]  Let him slide.  I think they were just mortified.  You think?  They were so embarrassed for Bruce.  Oh, was that Emma from the...  Yeah, that was Emma.  Our friend Emma.  They were so embarrassed for Bruce.  I think they just wanted to let it go.  You know what we would have done.  We would have just kept pushing and pushing.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, of course.  I'll tell you how to crawl into the fetal position.  And, Bruce, how do you feel about Roger Daltrey announcing he has cancer?  Stop.  Blubbering fat man.  Jimmy was making a good point during that audio. 
[02:00:00]  Just the fact that this boob is crying over fucking Daltrey and his tight slacks, and then  you have the audio of the guy who is in the bombing, who's like, oh, well, we'll just  get on with it.  Yeah.  Well, we'll get on with it then.  Yeah, and here he is blubbering.  Yeah, let's listen to the commuter in London, you know, dealing with real shit, and this  is how he handled it.  Were you worried at all about taking this train after what happened?  No, not really.  Why not?  Just the way it goes.  That's London all the way around.  We had it.  We were at the R.A. 
[02:00:30]  We had it.  We were all the others.  We'd just get on with life, didn't we?  They'd be downcast for a couple of days, but right when the R.A. bombs were here, after  a couple of days, back to normal.  There you go.  Back to normal.  There you go.  Oh, I'm crying.  I'm crying.  How about the bus came off?  And now let's hear, you have Bruce crying, isolated.  Listen to this.  I'm sorry.  I'm absolutely crying.  I can't help you.  I really can't.  I'm absolutely crying. 
[02:01:00]  They should have said, here, wipe your tears with this, and handed him a cock.  And this is the guy that wanted to run Channel 2.  Yeah, that's the type of guy we need here at the helm.  Yeah, when things get tough, he's going to report back to us crying.  Loses it at a Who concert.  I'm sorry.  I'm absolutely crying.  I can't.  I really can't.  I'm sorry, guys.  I finally got a glimpse of Ben's hog, and I'm crying.  I don't know if I can run the channel anymore. 
[02:01:30]  I'm absolutely crying.  The little lilt in his life.  I'm absolutely crying.  I'm like an idiot.  I'm sorry.  I'm really.  No, no.  It's just overwhelming.  Overwhelming?  Overwhelming?  Yeah.  Being 51 and seeing a rock band.  What's overwhelming about that?  What is overwhelming?  I'm sorry.  I'm absolutely crying.  I can't help it.  I really can't.  I wouldn't react that way if Kiss brought me on stage and hugged me in front of the audience. 
[02:02:00]  We've got to get in touch with him.  I have to get.  I want to ask him what was going through his mind.  Come on, Bruce.  You've got to call us.  What the hell is...  I want to get Emma in here, because she's in the office a lot.  I would love to ask what was going through her mind.  Her mind, when she looked over, and there's Bruce just crying over the hood.  She's not in here, right?  No.  Yeah.  Over the hood.  Well, Harry T, you know.  Who's Harry T?  Took it upon himself?  Oh, it's just Harry.  None of this T shit with him.  No.  It's too, like, cool an end.  Hey, Harry T's coming.  Harry T, huh? 
[02:02:30]  Hey, Harry T.  No, it's Harry.  Harry the intern.  Exactly.  Harry I.  Yeah.  He took it upon himself to take the audio and do something with it.  This could be the first one of, who knows, many.  Don't say who.  Who.  I'm absolutely crying.  Another assignment for America, so we don't have to work as hard.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I'm absolutely crying.  I can't help it.  I really can't.  When you just said the isolated, it's even better, man.  Oh, is that great?  Let's keep playing it over.  I'm sorry. 
[02:03:00]  I'm absolutely crying.  I can't help it.  I really can't.  He's the worst crier, too, man.  He tried to hold it together.  Right when he walked up to him, he's like, yep.  Yep.  I just can't help it.  I mean, my voice isn't what it used to be, and I'm never going to get that part in the  picture.  That's the type of crying when it happens live.  There's only one reaction you have, and that is to look away.  Like, you're not sympathetic.  You just need to look anywhere but at the person that's crying in front of you.  You know what I mean? 
[02:03:30]  Oh, it's horrible.  Yeah, let me hear that again.  I'm sorry.  I'm absolutely crying.  I can't help it.  I really can't.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  Someone make montage of Kelly's sisters.  I have no idea.  Oh, Bruce Kelly and Bob Kelly.  Those fucking blubbering idiots.  Oh, God.  Oh, wow.  Jesus.  Very good.  I'm sorry.  Kelly's sisters.  Derek, go ahead.  Yeah, the sister thing threw me off.  Go ahead, Derek.  I'm sorry. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, yeah.  I just wanted to know when someone was going to put together a little montage about the  two Kelly sisters crying.  Hold my hand.  Bob and Bruce.  Hold my hand.  Oh, that's great.  That last name.  There's something with that last name.  It just makes you a fucking sissy.  Yeah.  Yeah, a couple of fags.  God, very good.  That's the obvious that we didn't even think of.  I see the wheels turning in the other room there.  Is that what you see?  I just see three guys standing there doing nothing.  Well, it could be funny, though, with, hold my hand, man.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. 
[02:04:30]  I'm absolutely crying.  I can't help it.  I really can't.  Could you hear that with Kelly's, uh...  Hold my hand, man.  Hold my hand, man.  Hold my hand, man.  God.  The Kelly sisters.  Very good.  The Kelly sisters.  We'll try to work up something.  But here's Harry.  Harry T.  Harry.  Harry T.  Yuck.  Gave yourself that name.  Freaky little ghoul.  Can't come in and give yourself a little nickname like that.  Hey, call me Harry T. 
[02:05:00]  No.  How about Denny Terrio hairdo?  That's what I'll call you.  Wait a minute.  Chris from Ohio with a Paul Anka impression.  Oh.  Yes, Chris.  Uh...  Oh, boy.  Customers get customer service.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  The customers get fucking customer service.  Oh.  Oh.  He couldn't say puns.  God.  Damn, you stink.  See?  This isn't that easy.  Right from the start.  Right when he went...  Ah.  You just knew it was falling apart at the seams. 
[02:05:30]  The caller gets a tub and a razor.  The caller gets a tub and a razor.  You fucking floundering idiot.  That guy was on hold and the wheels were just falling off and he was praying we would get  to him faster.  He knew he was losing it.  Hey, you're on the...  Oh, God.  The caller...  The caller get...  Cuss...  Huh.  Are we working on a bit where the listeners blow it, too?  Yeah, that's a good one.  That's a real good one.  That happens.  I want to hear a montage of listeners just panicking. 
[02:06:00]  Hub-a-pub.  Where they fall apart.  Which way did he go?  All right.  So, here's Harry's Bruce Kelly crying thing that he put together.  Is this live?  Yes, we're live.  Bruce, where were you, buddy?  I was right up under the footogs.  And Bruce Kelly is a complete tool.  I'm sorry.  I'm absolutely crying.  I can't help it.  I really can't.  This is no fake.  You know, the whole moment just kind of got to me. 
[02:06:30]  Fucking cry, baby.  It was just very...  I mean, you know, it's just a who.  You know, I can't help but be a 14-year-old kid out there with a who.  And that's it.  You can't cry.  There's no crying in satellite radio.  I'm sorry.  It's very awkward.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  As a man, that is so tough to listen to. 
[02:07:00]  I can't help but be a 14-year-old kid out there with a who.  Okay.  That's it.  Sorry.  Fucking cry, baby.  I'd be crying if I had to watch the who too, but for different reasons.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Sorry.  I'm sorry.  Because you're a faggot, all right?  Hi, this is Jay Moore.  Hey, this is Chris Jericho.  This is Bernie Guest.

I know you want what's on my mind.  I know you like what's on my mind.  I know the issue of this time.  I know you know, you know, you know.  That's what I do now. 
[02:08:30]  Why say the same crap coming back from break? 
[02:09:00]  Really?  People have heard it.  From now on, I just want to go.  And then I go to the phone.  Mr. Motherfucker from whackbag.com.  Yeah, get Patrice in.  Yeah, just wondering, do you think First Kelly is going to be in a sequel to Vulgar?  Yeah.  You know, someone handed me Vulgar Drops, actually.  What a disturbing movie that was.  One of the most disturbing movies ever.  I think it's hysterical.  A clown. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, I thought you said the clown.  A clown gets raped.  Some guy gets raped by a man and his sons.  A man and his sons.  Just like a clown.  A clown that's just trying to get by.  Dante from Clerks.  Yeah, make a little money.  But no, he runs into these freaks that rape him.  This father and his two sons.  In what, a motel or something?  Yeah.  It's so creepy.  It's supposed to be like a bachelor party goof or something.  And he shows up and they shut the door and just drug him and rape him. 
[02:10:00]  Sometimes you watch movies and you look at the actor and go, he's not acting.  Yeah.  He has some experience in this.  You know?  Yeah.  Like the father in that movie?  Come on, he's acting all that?  A little into it.  All right, thanks, bro.  No problem.  Some audio from Vulgar.  Listen to this.  Bye, fuckface.  Kept calling him that.  Oh, they're short.  Hold on, let me tell you.  That was short.  Let me do it this way.  I'll do it this way, then.  Bye, fuckface. 
[02:10:30]  Wait, that was...  Hello, fuckface.  Mm-hmm.  Remember, he was leaving messages?  Yes.  Blackmail.  Who the fuck you think you're talking to, party boy?  I'll show them the goddamn tape.  I'll bury you, fuckface.  Yeah, he videotaped it.  Because you have no other choice, Mr. Fuckface.  Stop calling me that.  Oh, that's real tough.  Stop calling me that.  Wow, what are you gonna do? 
[02:11:00]  The guy's got a tape of you taking it up the ass from him and his sons.  Fucking savages.  And this is all you can say?  Because you have no other choice, Mr. Fuckface.  Stop calling me that.  I'm not even supposed to be here today.  What's up, Patrice?  Patrice.  What's up, everybody?  How you doing?  What's going on?  You feeling safe today?  What do you mean?  Oh, from the dirty Arabs?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are you gonna do, man?  Yeah, nothing.  What are you gonna do?  You can't control them unless you act like... 
[02:11:30]  Unless you violate somebody's civil rights.  Well, yeah.  I think you gotta start doing some of that, though.  Live with them.  I love racism.  I want white people to be racist against me so I can be racist against everybody else.  I don't want to stop it.  We were talking about that earlier, though.  The whole white-black thing, black-white thing, whatever, however you want to say it, it's  been knocked down again.  Well...  Now we're all friends again.  Well, not really, because I was listening to you guys complain about electronics, and  that's just something niggas just don't do, is sit around and go, customer service. 
[02:12:00]  I bought a light bulb that said 10 years, it only lasted 8.6, so I called you, bunch  of dicks.  I couldn't believe y'all was in here talking about your computers with that much passion.  Well, if you guys have a problem, you just steal a new one.  That's what I'm saying.  That's why I don't buy the warranty.  Nah, I don't buy the warranty.  I'm just gonna buy a new computer, because black people already know what's going on  with this.  Are people still buying those warranties?  White people!  That is funny, though, man.  He just...  Like, all of a sudden, he completely made me feel like a stupid whitey. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, my God, yeah.  Because I'm in there, and I know he's looking in the window, and my arms are flailing.  And I'm like, I can't get him on the phone line.  Customer service demo.  My arms are flailing.  I'm just looking at you going, is Anthony getting crazy over Del Capito?  Rawr!  And let me tell you another thing, man.  India, like, you call it laziness, but black people call it healthy paranoia.  We do not believe in anything that's going to be right.  So, it's like...  So, you just expect it.  Oh, white entitlement is hilarious to listen to. 
[02:13:00]  And then, check this out.  And, uh, EasyPass, you know what?  Black people have been saying for years, EasyPass is a government scam, because I don't...  I don't quite...  I caught...  I was hearing it, but I couldn't hear it.  It didn't have a lot out there.  But black people for years have been saying, EasyPass, you...  It tracks your movements.  Yeah.  So, you go through the holland, and then the next EasyPass, if you get there quicker than 
[02:13:30]  the speed limit between each thing...  Right.  ...you get a goddamn ticket in the mail.  But they're not doing that.  Well, I don't know.  They can do it.  I don't have EasyPass.  But it's not the EasyPass that's getting the black guys the tickets, it's those ankle  bracelets.  Good.  See, I don't want to take that away from Norton, so I can look at an Arab funny every day.  Right.  I want Norton to be able to say ankle bracelet jokes, so I can look at that. 
[02:14:00]  Because the racism's there, so you might as well be able to have a little fun with it,  too, with the Arabs.  And I want to see if a black girl's missing an Aruba.  So, what's going to happen?  Oh, yeah.  We admitted that.  We admitted that once.  I don't know how many times I've pointed out the fact that when a little white girl  goes missing, they put out the Amber Alerts, and it's insane.  People go crazy.  The picture's all over the paper.  And you barely ever hear a poor little black girl that's been kidnapped, eight years old, 
[02:14:30]  or something like that.  Oh, that little nigglet run away.  That little nigglet ran away.  God damn it.  There was a great...  You're right.  No one really seems to care as much.  There was a great black-white story.  Remember the grandma that was giving birth?  The oldest woman to give birth?  Yeah.  She was 60-something.  And then the following day, they found a black lady.  Same fucking thing.  She got maybe a mention.  Old slave hoe.  Yeah.  Yeah, old slave hoe.  Old slave hoe still popping out them babies.  And the white grandma, she was on every morning news program. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, my goodness, her white uterus is still working.  It's beautiful.  You motherfuckers.  And then there was a black grandma, and this is all you heard.  Yeah.  What?  Nothing.  Black granny?  Yeah, whatever.  I'm sure black people are getting bitten by the sharks, but we're not going to hear about it.  But no one cares.  No one cares.  And it's no big deal.  That's the thing.  I don't even get into this whole thing.  I don't care anymore.  Yeah.  Look, you just, like, the world is so effed up right now where you go, eh, you just. 
[02:15:30]  Who cares?  It's like F1 fighters finding this little white girl.  You know she's not dead.  She's somewhere else.  She, who, how did those three idiots do what they did and then hide her in, like, secret caves, places that the Aruban people don't even know exist?  Don't know about.  It's a pretty small island.  Stop.  Stop.  Yeah.  Stop.  You know what I mean?  Give me a, just give me a break with that.  You think she's alive somewhere?  Ah, she's somewhere, but she's fucking, um. 
[02:16:00]  Do you think she's down now?  She's got a taste of some dreadlock balls and she can't stop.  She can't stop herself.  There were actually two black guys that went down to one of the islands and got murdered down there.  And you barely heard anything about it.  Barely?  And it wasn't, uh, what, barely nothing?  You didn't hear anything?  Nothing about it.  Yeah.  News to me.  Two guys, yeah, went down there and, uh, you got murdered and you just really didn't hear anything about it.  What's your take on the Howard Beach thing? 
[02:16:30]  Look, man.  We've been talking about that story for a little over a week now.  I mean, for the rest of the country, basically, a few brothers were in a...  Three black guys wandered into Howard Beach looking to steal a car and, uh, a white guy driving around in his Escalade kind of gotten some kind of a eyeball altercation.  This guy, Fat Nick, uh, got a couple of his buddies in a baseball bat, went after him, got one of the guys, beat him over the head, put him in the hospital with a fractured skull.  And, uh, now he's up on hate crime charges. 
[02:17:00]  Let me, let me ask, let me ask white people this.  Let me ask you this.  I think you're, by the way, going to be surprised at the angle we took on the Howard Beach thing.  I didn't...  Do you get embarrassed when you think it's getting better?  Do white people go, I think it's in your white world, do you go, things are getting so much better?  And then you hear this, you go, oh my god, I thought everything was...  Everything was good.  I thought it...  I didn't think niggas were kidding me with tats anymore.  It's just, it's not, it's like not a surprise. 
[02:17:30]  I'm not delusional.  I know shit ain't getting any better than it was.  People's feelings haven't changed.  Laws have been put in place that make it harder to be racist, that's all.  That's what it is.  It's legislated.  It's not, yeah, it's legislated.  Like, that's making racism go away?  No.  There's still black guys that hate white guys, there's still black guys that hate black guys.  But I think it's something we do.  I think it's something we like to do.  You know what I'm saying?  It's basic animal nature.  People enjoy, like animals, people enjoy hanging out with their own people more than they do other people's people. 
[02:18:00]  That's why you'll have white guys with black friends, black friends, black guys, white friends,  but for the most part, when you're going out, it's like usually with your own people.  You don't want some conglomerated, malada, mongrel group of friends.  Both races will be destroyed in such a movement.  I guess that's true, because I consider myself a friend with Opie, and any time I try to hug him, you should just look at the face. 
[02:18:30]  The spear, right?  I don't like hugging.  Why not?  Fear.  First of all, you could squash me.  I'm gentle when I come up with you.  He's a big, gentle bear of a hug.  You know what?  And Opie, you know how Opie's great?  He doesn't even hide, like, how uncomfortable he is.  His whole face mushes in, like, are you getting ready to goddamn hug me, motherfucker?  I hate hugging big guys just because, and I don't care what friggin' Cully are, just for the fact that I come out as the bitch in the relationship, 
[02:19:00]  and I actually, there are times I put my foot up, like, I'm hugging, and my foot goes up, and I'm like, I am a little bitch in this relationship.  I make friends with the fake black people.  Why?  What's fake black people?  They're fake black people.  Like Earl?  Earl's totally a fake black.  You think you're hanging with one of these ghetto brothers, and you realize he's just as white as us.  He's just safe.  You know, you want to feel like, hey, look at me, hanging with the ghetto bro.  You want Sinbad, not Fiddy.  And then as soon as, you know, Earl and I are walking down the street and a real brother is coming the other way, he's just as scared. 
[02:19:30]  He's just, I remember this kid in high school.  In other words, Drew Boogie.  I remember this kid in high school.  He was the black kid.  I played basketball, so.  And this one black kid on our team was, he acted like he was.  One black kid on your basketball team?  No, we had, I mean.  Oh, okay, this one, this particular.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a little town called Paradise.  Come on, it was Green Lawn.  It must have been at least two.  This guy had everything going that the ghetto had going. 
[02:20:00]  He had the styles, the movement, the talk.  He would walk those halls, and quite frankly, most of us were like, oh, a little intimidated by the guy.  He had it.  It looked like he had it, right?  So we go and play, I think it was Amityville, which is, you want to talk about.  Oh, yeah.  A black neighborhood.  It's the real deal.  Amityville, where the house is.  Amityville, New York, it seriously is a black man.  That's South Amityville, though.  That's kind of a nice area.  Beach houses.  We're talking North Amityville.  We're talking Disney.  Yeah.  In order to get through the Amityville horror, you have to go through North Amityville. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, okay.  Which is much more of a horror show, my goodness.  Whoa.  But, so this kid.  Lock your doors.  So you get the idea.  This guy, you know, had this image like he was a badass motherfucker from the ghetto, right?  Right.  So we go to Amityville to play these guys, and then, first of all, there's a curfew in the town back in the day.  Right.  And we had armed guards that got us armed.  Armed?  I swear to God.  Really? 
[02:21:00]  Whatever.  Wow.  A police officer, whatever, okay?  That's not, so this is all not, you know.  No, not a surprise story.  Because our basketball team was, you know, mostly white, yes.  Right.  There was maybe two or three brothers on the team.  So, so we had guys that escorted us from the bus to the locker room to the bench where we played, and they were behind us.  And it was, it was, I'm not going to lie, it was a scary, scary scene when you're not used to this type of thing.  And this guy that was supposed to be the badass guy from the ghetto was just as scared as us.  And that's when I realized there's black guys and there's fake black guys. 
[02:21:30]  Amityville high school guys were in their 30s.  I'm in the middle.  Oh, yeah, they all had full beards and dunking over us.  I thought the game was over after the first quarter, but we still had to play three more quarters.  It was just, what a nightmare.  I didn't become friends.  And that kid was on the bench, just as scared, getting a little closer to us.  I'm like, man, you've been a phony all these years.  Well, he's not a phony.  It's just, there's levels to it, man.  It's like, I grew up in one of the toughest parts of that.  But I was always, I was a clown, man. 
[02:22:00]  I was a chubby clown.  But I knew how to play basketball, and I was funny.  So the dudes that were gangsters didn't mess with me, you know what I mean?  But I, if you, I know I'm comfortable around that because I know how to get around, but  I'm not that, I'm not, you know.  But I didn't have white friends until I started doing comedy.  Being funny keeps you out of a lot of shit.  It does, man.  Really does help out in school.  You don't get beat.  You know, there's those little cliques that go around, you know, the jocks and all that  bullshit in high school and stuff.  And I was pretty much on good terms with all of them, you know. 
[02:22:30]  Because you was funny.  And if you picked on the right, like, if you wasn't a bully with your funniness, like,  I went after everybody, you know what I mean?  Like, Norton goes after everybody.  And I know Norton probably took a slap back in the day.  No, I didn't get beat up much.  Shut up.  I didn't.  Leave him alone.  All right, I would run.  But just to interrupt me for one second, I was going for, I used to wear Kangos, you know,  because I was in that awful phase.  And I was going to get a drink of water.  And this black kid, this tough black kid from, like, a real awful neighborhood who had moved 
[02:23:00]  in, cut in front of me, and just kind of moved me, and I was like, all right, go ahead.  Like, I was kind of letting, like, yeah, you're giving him permission.  Two gangsters getting a little water.  Go ahead, homeboy.  I know you thirsty.  Thirsty.  My face is getting hot just thinking about that.  Oh, yeah, go ahead.  When Orlando took my Kangos off, and I turned around and snapped, he goes, you want to fight  me?  And I'm like, if you want to look at my hat, just ask.  Just ask.  Can't you see Norton in high school with his golf gloves, his up-to-the-form, gothic 
[02:23:30]  gloves, and his dumb black t-shirts?  I just saw a video last night that you just reminded me of I want to bring up on the show  today, okay?  There was a black guy harassing this white guy and his chick.  Classic scene.  Like, what are you going to do?  You know, the whole black thing going down, right?  Intimidating.  And you're feeling, you're watching this video.  Maybe Steve has it on FoundryMusic.com, or we can get it up there immediately.  Someone sent it to me.  And the guy looks like he's going to get the shit kicked out. 
[02:24:00]  And then there's other homies around, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, just losing it.  Sorry.  But, sorry, whatever.  You see how he stood up?  Something happened to Opie.  I'm going to find out what it was.  I'm dedicated to my art.  Sorry.  But you know the whole scene.  You know, it's just the guy with his chick, and now he's being harassed.  I don't know what he did.  Maybe he deserves it.  And this black guy squares up, like, come on, we're going, right?  And you're feeling bad for the guy in the video.  All of a sudden, the guy goes into one of these deep master po karate stances. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, I saw it.  Knocked the motherfucker right out.  Holy shit.  The guy obviously was a third degree black something.  Yep.  Heavy duty, right?  And now he's just doing the moves, and the black guy, slowly but surely, is getting, went  from, like, not scared of anything to, like, very, you know, intimidated.  But now, he can't be showed up, right?  So now he's going to fight anyway?  And you saw the result.  Got knocked the fuck out.  This guy took pretty much one punch and just, just slaughtered the movie. 
[02:25:00]  His friend had to drag him.  His friend had to, like, drag him across the street.  Wait, is this the pimp?  The pimp guy.  Who got knocked out in the street?  Yeah, yeah.  Wait, that's a pimp?  You see that?  Yeah.  He was a pimp.  Yes, he was a pimp, but the best part of that is how the black guy was so intimidating  and you felt so bad for the white guy, and all of a sudden, he goes into this stance and  like, oh, my God, can you imagine?  Chalk up one.  I can't wait till all the, you got the video?  I can't wait till all the white guys get confidence from the story.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, no, no. 
[02:25:30]  I hope he's giving white people hope.  Hey, let me tell you something.  All black guys are woofing.  You can do it.  It's not even a black-white thing.  The point I'm going to make is you never know who you're going to fuck with, because  this guy looked like he was obviously a very easy target, but then he's like, all right,  I guess I got to go.  He gets way down low and gets ready for the fight.  I'm like, oh, my God.  Yeah.  Master Poe has freckles, you know what I mean?  And you just don't know he could just break all your limbs, you know what I mean?  Yeah, he'll kick your ass.  He'll use like a broom handle.  You can see he's a kook, though. 
[02:26:00]  When you look at his eyes, they're kind of like looking through you.  You can kind of see he's like a problem.  He's a fucking sociopath on some level.  He's the type of person that bites eight peoples in a Wendy's and just doesn't remember it.  Maybe he can say people instead of peoples.  Peoples.  Steve's getting the video, and he'll put it up on opianthony.com for the weekend.  Well, can we see if Steve wears it?  Pot it up.  I know.  You just need to see the first part where the chick and the guy, and you just feel bad for  the guy.  Like, oh, God, he's got to defend.  There comes another beating, like the guy in the pizza place. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, that was awful.  He's got to defend his girlfriend, and it's going to be ugly, but he's got to do, you  know, and then when he goes into the karate stance, you're like, oh, my God.  He was, like, debating, do I really want to knock this guy out or not?  Yeah, look.  Yeah.  Oh, that's not the one.  That's not the one?  No, man.  Wow, are you kidding?  Well, then look at this.  Oh, that's the pimp one.  No.  You'll enjoy this one, then.  See, there's a hoe who's trying to hold her pimp back.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because the guy now wants to go across the street and beat the crap out of this white guy.  Right.  So the hoe's trying to hold him back.  Yeah, do the play-by-play. 
[02:27:00]  He rips his shirt off.  Right.  Now he's a shirtless pimp.  He walks up to the white guy.  White guy is eyeing him up.  And bam.  Oh, boy.  Oh, wow.  And he is down.  He gave him one, like, back fist.  Yeah.  No, the one I'm talking about, it's a young white kid with his, you know, with his just  girlfriend, not a hooker or anything.  He gave him, like, a back fist or something. 
[02:27:30]  No, you've got to see the other one.  Because what's great about the other one is the guy actually goes into the karate, you  know, stance, like, all right.  And you just, as you're watching this video, you're like, oh, man.  That one wasn't a train game.  You don't have that one yet?  No.  Damn it.  I didn't save it.  I just assumed it had it.  That was a big, he, like, he squared off like he was going to punch him with his right.  He just swung his lefty backhanded him with his lefty.  That was a strong get away from me.  Yeah.  But knocked his ass out.  It was a karate move, yeah.  Wait, let's go to Sean in New York.  Sean.  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Hey.  Hi. 
[02:28:00]  Hi, Pookie.  Oh, my God, Sean, come on.  Sometimes you've got to just go with the flow.  Let's go.  Go.  Hey, that video you're looking for opens on big-boys.com.  Oh, big boys, yeah.  What's that website about?  A lot of cool movies.  You just go there and download videos of horrors and atrocities and beatings and car wrecks.  I mean, it's like a fart.com for video clips.  It's just fucking incredible.  Awesome.  Thank you, Sean.  All right.  Later, boys.  All right.  Well, that sounds like a good website to check out, and we'll find the video on there, and  we'll link it or do whatever you do. 
[02:28:30]  What's it from?  Where did it take place?  I don't know.  I don't know the history of it.  The guy was just kind of walking with his girlfriend, and all of a sudden the black guy,  for whatever reason, you know, is harassing him, and then they square off.  That's where I get all my fun videos, like the black guy in the pizza parlor that beat  up the white guy, and the kid riding in the back of the, riding his, what was he doing?  He was opening the back car door.  He was in the car door.  He was in the car.  He's opening the back door and hitting people on their bicycles with it. 
[02:29:00]  So he goes to do it one time, and the driver kind of swerves, he hangs out the door, he  falls out, he's trying to hold on to the door, and hits his head on a parked car bumper.  It's phenomenal footage.  It's fantastic.  It's better than the Zapruder film.  Fantastic.  Jeez.  That's not Ogre's.  You can go to Ogre's and get that.  Yeah.  I don't want to go to Ogre's.  That's a little too much.  Do you find that you, when you're getting older, man, that you can't watch?  I can't not.  I used to be able to watch a beheading.  No, I can't watch that shit anymore.  Or, like, crossing my legs, eating, you know.  Nope.  Nope.  Can't watch the beheadings. 
[02:29:30]  Nope.  Can't watch them.  It's just, I think you get closer to God when you just get older for some reason.  It's too much to watch.  I can't watch somebody in that much agony.  I just can't do it.  Can't do it.  Did you see the WWF last night?  Or WWE?  What?  No.  Last night?  Oh, the dude, in the beginning, because of the London thing, they go, due to tonight's,  due to the London, you know, tragedy in London, tonight's episode of Raw is going to be,  or tonight's episode of Smackdown is going to be, uh, parental league, you know, parental 
[02:30:00]  guys, right?  So, they have a character, like a, uh, a terrorist character.  Oh, jeez.  Muhammad, whatever.  Of course.  So, he's fighting the Undertaker.  So, he has this lackey guy who always kind of talks for him.  He's going, uh, la, la, la, la, la, la.  So, they made him fight the Undertaker.  So, the Undertaker beats him up in seven seconds.  So, the guy says to his friend before he goes out, he goes, look, if you do this, you will  be rewarded by Allah, right?  So, after the Undertaker beat him up, the dude gets on his knees and starts praying, right? 
[02:30:30]  La, la, la, la, la, you know?  And, about six mass, like, terrorist dudes come out and beat the shit.  They beat up the Undertaker, right?  You know, terrorize him.  And then, the beat-up guy in the ring that the Undertaker beat up, they carry him out as  if he's a martyr, uh, in, in Afghanistan, or whatever the case may be.  I'm like, they went through an entire, like, it was a whole skit.  What are they, insane?  That's what, it was, I, I'm watching it, and I think stuff like that's hilarious, but I'm 
[02:31:00]  going, oh, my God!  That's a little tasteless.  I'm like, I didn't, I didn't, it was like the terrorist dude, and if you watch any of  them dudes, the beheading, those dudes, they came dressed just like those dudes.  Really?  And beat up the Undertaker, you know, did his, you know, ah!  Every time they hit him, they would pray.  I, I, I, I think, I think Vince is getting desperate at this point.  That's, that's not, uh, oh!  Whoa!  And, and, and you know I love stuff, I just was like, oh! 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, you're kind of like, ugh!  But, you know, when I wrote for them, I, they used to have a character, this Indian dude,  and Vince is a cold dude, man, and, yeah, this Indian dude.  Yeah, we never talked to you about that.  I think Jimmy brought it up or something.  You used to fly around with Vince McMahon or something?  In a Learjet.  In a Learjet and write for WWF?  Write for, write for WWF.  Vince McMahon, there's three people I've met in my life.  You know, you probably can name them, people in your life where you met and you, you lost  your man-ness.  Like, you, you try to go, hey, what's happening?  Hey, good to see you, Michael Jackson. 
[02:32:00]  Nice talking to you.  But there's some people you meet and you're just incomplete.  Yeah, because we're all meeting Michael Jackson.  Jesus.  But, but you, you know what I'm saying?  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, that's a great example, though.  But there's people, like, if you met Michael Jackson, would you be, you, you've been in the  business long enough where you go, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  Someone like Michael Jackson, he's, like, uber famous, I think, I would, I would be starstruck.  A little bit.  Yeah, without a doubt.  Fair enough.  I don't typically get starstruck, but, I mean, I probably would.  Shut up, Mr. Pictures with everybody.  You're starstruck.  I was starstruck when you walked in. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, I had a, I had a little of that, actually, yeah.  Thank you, dude.  Just a little bit.  A little tickle in your stomach.  I saw him on Tough Crowd.  But, it's like, I met a few people, like, maybe four, three or four, where I go, oh, boy.  I was at his house in Stanford, writing.  They were rewriting.  Nice house, too.  And he just comes out, hello, Patrice.  And his, and his jumpsuit and his everything, and I just was like, oh, my God.  I was like, oh, like a little girl, like, hey.  Hi, Mr. Pictures.  Yeah, we've had him on a few times. 
[02:33:00]  And he says he's a powerful dude, man, but he's a cold dude.  Now, this one guy, he used to have a turban.  He goes in, and none of the wrestlers talk to him personally, you know, except for the big guys.  Like, I'm on a plane with, like, Triple H.  Everybody else got to drive their, like, Hyundai Sonatas from town to town.  But, like, Triple H, Undertaker, those guys, they get on his plane.  So, I'm in the back and, you know, watching this whole thing go down.  And he, this guy with the turban, he goes, listen, my family says, please, can you stop making fun of my turban? 
[02:33:30]  Oh, no.  Because my people, Tiger, Tiger, Tiger Ali Singh.  Tiger Ali Singh.  He's like, please, don't make fun of the, he goes, he goes, shut up and put on a turban.  Please, my people. 
[02:34:00]  I beg you.  Put on the turban.  Like the Jerky Boys, dude.  He's just like, my people.  He's like, I don't want to hear that nonsense.  Get out there and put on that stupid turban, you jackass.  It was like, oh, my God.  Oh, there's the clip from WWE last night.  By the way, someone's pointing out.  Yeah, they're choking the shit out of the Undertaker.  Someone's pointing out that they taped this on Tuesday, so it's a huge coincidence that.  Really?  Yeah, that the bombings were, what, yesterday?  Yeah, they're choking him dressed in there. 
[02:34:30]  We're cutting a Christian man's head off.  Yeah, but watch how they take the other dude away.  Yeah.  Like he's the martyr.  Yeah.  It was brutal.  And you know, I think anything is funny, man, but I was like, this is not good.  They even lifted his hair, like his head, like the way.  Yeah, yeah.  And they lifted the Undertaker's head.  I'm telling you, it was brutal.  They're thinking, man.  That's a touchy subject.  That is a touchy subject. 
[02:35:00]  To reenact a beheading in a wrestling ring.  Yeah.  Hey, are you?  Were you responsible for some of the legendary storylines on WWF in recent years?  One that comes to mind?  No, I was the fourth man on the totem pole.  They have a kid there, this young white kid who's the boss.  But if I'd have stayed, I just couldn't deal with what they were asking.  And I couldn't do that little Learjet with them.  And, you know, I just couldn't do it because they're very corporate. 
[02:35:30]  You have to be committed to their cause.  And I just wasn't committed.  You know what I'm saying?  And I got fired.  What's her name?  Stephanie fired me like six times.  Really?  She kept calling me back and firing me.  But she doesn't realize comics just get fired.  So she goes, you know you're fired, right?  I go, yeah.  I understand.  I do understand.  You know what I mean?  I'm not going to.  What would you get fired for?  Because I had a show.  Yeah.  And I said I can't make it.  And she's like, what?  You're committed?  Yeah. 
[02:36:00]  They want 100% loyalty over there.  I was like, I met Steve Austin.  It was good enough.  The thing that I took from it is how powerful Vincent Mayer was and how the rock was cooler  than he should have been.  Yeah.  Like he was just too accessible.  I didn't want him to be that accessible.  Just like a regular guy.  Hey, man.  Hey, how you doing?  They were real regular guys.  And they kissed the writers' asses because the writers make up scenarios for them to  become whatever.  So they, this little white kid, he has these giant roided up dudes like, ha, ha, ha, kiss 
[02:36:30]  him, kiss an ass.  And he's like, ah.  Was he good?  What he did?  The kid?  Yeah.  He must have been because he was Vince's right-hand dude, man.  You're fired.  You're fired.  Bye-bye.  Do they write scripts or just storylines?  They write everything done.  Really?  There's, there's some who get leeway, like Kurt Angle, the biggies.  They, they can, they can talk.  Yeah.  They can say words that aren't, uh, there sometimes. 
[02:37:00]  But the other guys, you stick to the script.  But they do not, do not play around with that, man.  Wow.  He runs that with an iron fist.  He's behind every, he's behind the scenes, sitting there at the, when they come out with  the explosions.  Uh-huh.  He's there, like, all right, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,  you know, doing, running it.  It's the director.  All right, here it is.  Oh, you got that one.  Finally.  All right.  I don't mean to be finally.  Make sure this one ends up, uh, on opianthony.com.  Get it up on opianthony.com. 
[02:37:30]  So, you got the, yeah, check this out.  So, this is the video I was talking about.  A white guy with his, uh, blonde, good-looking girlfriend.  Yeah, look at that.  There's a bunch of guys, like, harassing him.  It's not fair.  There's only one black guy.  Yeah, they look like white guys.  Yeah, what's going on?  Well, it turns out to be, oh, no, oh, shit, you are in trouble.  When he, when that guy pulls that karate shit out of his hat, you are in trouble.  Look at this black guy.  Now he's scared.  He doesn't know what to do.  Look at him.  Oh, no. 
[02:38:00]  Look at him.  Oh, boy.  But he knows, the black guy now knows he can't back down, right?  Oh, no.  So, so he's looking around like, how do I, what the, how do I?  How do you get out of this one?  He's with his boys, and I'm sorry, I apologize.  It looks like it's, he, well, maybe there's another black guy.  Is he black?  Is he black, Opie?  He's not even black, Opie.  Come on.  Are you insane?  This guy's black.  He looks like a skinhead.  He's light-skinned black.  Look at this guy.  Are you sure about that?  Look at this guy.  He's, he's in major karate mode now, though. 
[02:38:30]  This guy's not black.  Now watch, watch, watch.  He's like, all right, well, I gotta, I gotta do something.  Black guy attempts to throw a prize.  Is he gonna try?  He's trying to get in there, and watch.  Watch this, Ant.  Oh, no.  Watch this.  He took a little jab at him.  Yeah, that's it.  Look at this guy knows how to fight.  Look at his arms going.  Oh, my God.  That guy knows how to fight.  Wow.  Now, his arms were flailing like he didn't know what he was doing, but everything was 
[02:39:00]  very calculated.  Can you show this to Master Paul?  Get that up on OpieAnthony.com.  See how much this guy, how good this guy really is, if he's a bummer?  That guy was deflecting everything, and then just saw an opening and punched that guy right  in the head.  Was he black, that guy?  No.  That guy was white.  Shut up.  That guy was white as snow, Opie.  Jesus, Opie.  Opie.  He was deflecting the riffs to be surrounded by.  They don't have to be as dark as Patrice to be considered black.  He was not black.  There wasn't even another black guy in the crowd.  There was no black people there.  There was like suburban houses in the background. 
[02:39:30]  He was doing black stuff.  That's what he was doing.  That guy's black.  He was like, I'll knock you out, sucker.  Thank you.  That guy is not black.  He's not black.  Oh, wait, it's South Beach.  He just has a good tan.  I'm sorry.  Where did you get that he was black?  That guy's black.  I don't know about that.  He's a skinhead.  I'm going to sue on behalf of all black people.  That guy's black.  But the point of Megan.  You're racist.  The point of Megan.  Exactly.  It looks like the karate dude is in deep shit.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden he goes into karate mode.  When he goes into that stance, you're just... 
[02:40:00]  You know the guy is just looking and going, oh, damn it.  Why did I pick this guy?  Why did I pick on this guy?  But no one goes into a karate stance, so you're going, ah, this guy doesn't know karate.  You think?  Because who does a karate stance in 2005?  Well, that's what the guy was thinking.  Maybe that's what he was thinking.  That was what the guy was thinking at first.  Look at him.  He's blocking everything and comes around with that right and lays him out.  Lays out that alleged black guy.  That white black guy.  I understand Oprah's angry at the Jews that beat up Reginald Denny.  And then Opie, who emphasizes a black guy, then he did a perfect white get out of it. 
[02:40:30]  Anyway, my point is...  All right.  My point is that he got knocked out like a nigger.  That was a white guy.  A white guy get out of it.  It's a nice, bright, sunny, suburban day.  Look, you know what?  I'm not going to take this abuse.  Get a poll up on opianandanthony.com with the video, and we'll have the results on Monday.  If he's black and out.  I didn't know what style that was.  That would have been interesting, man.  That was, that was, that was, oh, that was great. 
[02:41:00]  You should have asked Master Paul.  That was really showboating.  But it was just very interesting.  It really, I know.  It was very interesting to see the guy going from, oh my God, this poor guy, to holy shit,  this guy's got what it takes.  How great to know that type of shit where you can get into that stance and just go, all  right, come on, motherfucker.  Come on.  Another reason he wasn't black.  Yeah.  Let's be honest.  Mm-hmm.  That, no guns.  Right.  See?  Black people do not do that anymore.  And his boys would have not stood, his boys would have shot him right in his back. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  Well, Rick's on the line.  Rick?  Yeah.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Rick?  How's my favorite little Jimmy Norton doing?  Okay.  Get to the point, you fucking asshole.  Please, Rick.  You guys, sometimes you guys got to understand you have to get right to the point.  Other times we could fuck around a little bit.  The guy he's fighting is not black.  He's a fucking beaner.  If you look at him, he's got skinny little shorts with his socks pulled up.  He's not black.  He's Mexican?  He's got a big wide foot stand.  I don't think he was, I don't think he was Mexican either.  I think he was a white boy.  Because white guys, that happens with white guys. 
[02:42:00]  That guy would never feel comfortable enough getting in a karate stance when there's that  many black dudes around that's harassing.  Yeah.  Because, you know, I don't care how good you are at karate, that gun comes out.  Somebody's going to get stabbed or shot.  Period.  Right.  Well, not that it was a suburban, like they would just tie guys that would go to like a suburban.  You can look at the houses in the background.  That wasn't like a bad neighborhood.  Nobody would feel that comfortable in Harlem getting in a karate stance like that.  Right.  No white guy on planet.  He would have said, look, I know karate, please.  Or, I know, I have a cell phone and I know numbers. 
[02:42:30]  Let's go to Brian in Philly.  Brian?  Hey, I just wanted to say that that white guy went into pat battle mode.  Punching out.  Damn it.  Right.  I mean, it's fine and dandy to call the show and go, hey Ope, hey Ant, hi Jimmy, something  like that.  Fine.  But it's the guys that call up and go, hi Buttercup, and then wait.  They wait for a response and they go, all right.  What I wanted to say.  Get to the point. 
[02:43:00]  Just say hi to the show and get to your point.  The point, I'm going to make this times where that makes sense.  Of course.  Know the rhythm of the show.  Sometimes we're lazy, slow, suck, have fun.  But then there's times where we're rocking.  Let's go.  You've got to help us and keep us going here.  Hi, honey puss.  Hi.  Hi, Ope.  Hi, Ant.  Hi.  How you doing?  Hi, Jimmy, little sugar tits.  That's like being on a highway, 70, 75 miles an hour, and for no reason whatsoever, you  just decide to go down to 40. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  Right.  For nothing.  And then you go back up to 70.  If we're all driving at 40, join us at 40.  Right.  If we're going 75, 80, let's go.  You know, to be honest with you, I'm pretty savvy in the business, but I don't know if  I would know how to come in and stick with the rhythm.  I might call in and not even know what the rhythm is.  Well, then we only want professional callers.  We only want pro callers.  These dopes that fuckers.  That's a lot of me.  Y'all dig it.  You can't keep up.  Keep up with the rhythm, stupid.  I'm pulling up on this guy's bumper at 40 miles an hour. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, exactly.  I'm speeding along.  All right.  Patrice O'Neill in studio today doing a great job.  We want to find out what happened to Keefe.  Yeah, we will.  Let's take a quick break.  We all have to take leaks and stuff.  When he's supposed to be here, too?  Yeah.  Keefe is, see, I talked to him this morning.  He wasn't, you know, he's handling business.  Business.  He handles his family's business.  Keefe is the matriarch, the patriarch, right?  The patriarch of the Robinson clan.  Of the clan, man.  He has to run business.  Keefe stole it.  Does he have something going on, or is he just being Keefe?  Nah, I think I believe him, man.  And I know when Keith is lying, you know, and he's just like, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. 
[02:44:30]  I can't.  Robble, robble.  When he's not robble, robble.  Ah, robble, robble.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  But he wasn't.  He was, you know, you can hear he had something on his mind or whatever.  But no one cares.  He's still stupid.  He's just living in New York.  So when he has things on his mind, he can come into the radio station.  He's in Philly.  He's an ass.  All right, here we go.  Hey, Poe, what do you think?  Master Poe is studying the video.  Poe, have you seen the whole thing?  Is he black or white?  Well, he's going to settle back.  Poe, did you see the guy go into stance? 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, and you wouldn't do that, as he was saying, in a bad neighborhood, because he'll just break your leg.  Someone that knows how to fight, he'll just crack your leg right in the hat.  Really?  I don't know.  That seems like his leg is outstretched pretty far.  Do you watch the UFC?  No one does that.  No, they get together and just tie people in a knot.  But the guy got the job done in the end.  They can all fight, though.  He knew he was fighting some street-fighting guy who just was going to box him a little bit.  Those guys in the UFC can all do that.  But he did, like, a whole thing with his arms, and it was like, uh-oh, now you're in trouble. 
[02:45:30]  What was his style, Poe?  I believe it was either wushu or, well, kung fu.  Kung fu.  Yeah, wushu.  I like the wushu pork.  No, no, no, no, no, wushu.  It was wushu.  It looked like it, because he had a long stance.  Yeah.  And when he was shooing the blacks.  And if you noticed...  Yeah, wushu.  If you noticed...  That was so fucking awful.  It was funny.  It's my job.  Come up with the bad ones.  Thanks, Patrice.  It was wushu. 
[02:46:00]  Now, the strike at the very end was not calculated.  No?  No, it wasn't.  What was he doing?  I saw his arms, like, flailing, but in a defensive mode.  He was blocking a lot.  Yeah, he was.  And then it looked like that right came out.  It looked a little calculated.  That was called purpose to me, yeah.  I don't know fighting like Pono's fighting.  I don't have a trained eye.  A lot of people are now seeing the video, because it's up on opanthony.com, and they're  starting to say that looks more like a lucky shot.  Yeah.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  I don't know.  A lucky white guy shot. 
[02:46:30]  Let's just say he's...  At least he's mixed.  Yeah.  He's not a black guy.  No, that is absolutely not a black guy.  No.  You know that.  And it's not a black area, because no one feels that comfortable getting in the stance  like that.  Nope.  I don't know.  You might be in an area, if you're scared, you might do that just to try to, like, intimidate  people.  Why do that stance when you could spend that time running as quickly as you can away from  it?  Because you got your chick.  Which, you know, finally...  Hey, sorry.  The dude was a sitting duck, because, yeah, he was there with his chick.  He could have got killed, man.  And it was probably the chick that got him in the situation. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  You know, she was probably...  She said, look at that black guy.  And the guy wasn't black, and it pissed him off.  That's why pimping has to come into focus here.  Baby, keep your effing mouth shut.  It's easier to smack your bitch than it is getting in a fight.  Keep her alive.  Just go shut up and smack her.  Keep your bitch alive.  Bitch, shut up.  Ladies, we spend a lot of time with you acting like we're the toughest thing going, but the  reality is we're the biggest wimps going, and please don't get us in trouble out there.  Especially with people that are supposed to be black. 
[02:47:30]  Holy shit.  Might be Mexican.  How many times have you had, you know, your girlfriend or something, there's some kind  of traffic problem, and she's beeping your horn obnoxiously, and then they turn around,  and there's little old you behind the wheel, like, thanks.  Well, they blurt out stuff like, you know, go fuck yourself, and you're like, oh, now I'm  the guy.  Now I might as well have said it.  Your girl's not.  Your girl's not a big man.  Nah, she doesn't say that.  No.  No.  No confrontations like that.  My brain is not a big mouth either.  In the movie theater, she said something in the movie theater once.  Yeah.  She said, why don't you shut the fuck up to some Hispanic woman. 
[02:48:00]  Damn it.  Sean from Jersey.  And she was with a whole family, and her boyfriend, the Spanish woman's boyfriend, my girlfriend  said, why don't you shut the fuck up, because it escalated to that point.  And she went, you, what'd you say?  And the boyfriend went, uh-oh, you put her in battle mode.  I'm like, oh.  And I did what any self-respecting guy would do.  Got up and left the theater.  Got the manager.  I want the manager.  Customer service. 
[02:48:30]  Customer service.  Customer service.  My movie-going experience has been ruined by this Hispanic woman.  One moment, please, sir.  Your teeth are under the seat in front of you.  Press one.  Your girlfriend is being raped.  Press three.  Flip, flip, flip.  If you know the rape you like to see.  The movie theater owner, the manager, put me in another theater.  The movie that I was watching, I was about half an hour into, I think it was Mission Impossible 
[02:49:00]  2.  And another Mission Impossible 2 was starting at a theater next to this one.  So he moved me into that theater.  And that theater was just full of scared white people that were chased out of the other theater.  We're all just looking at each other with no self-respect.  Is that John Cruz?  John Cruz!  That's what was happening.  Oh, he looked fine.  That's all I was hearing.  That happened at War of the Worlds.  I was just on War of the Worlds.  Oh, really?  Uh-oh.  Watch out.  Watch out. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, here it comes.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  You better watch.  Oh.  He's gone now.  Where'd he come from?  Right out the ground?  Oh, boy.  Right out the ground.  Please don't be a stereotype, little girl.  What?  God?  What?  Getting some of the ringtones going on the phones.  Oh, God.  Don't forget.  Because black guys aren't even talking to theater no more.  We just handle quick.  It's a quick.  Yo, yo, yo, watch a movie. 
[02:50:00]  But girls, black parrots.  What?  Girl, what?  And don't say a fucking word about it.  He's cute for a white boy.  We're going to rewind back to that video.  We got Sean in Jersey.  Sean, get ahead.  Hey, guys.  I just saw the video.  Actually, his technique is called coon shoe.  Oh, you fucking asshole.  That was the obvious line, though.  That's why I wanted to.  I want white people to be able to do that for the rest of their life so I can be racist.  Thank you, sir. 
[02:50:30]  Coon shoe.  Coon foo.  Coon foo.  Coon foo.  You know, talking in the theaters has to stop.  Because a few years ago, when I saw Stardust Memories at the Magic Johnson Theater, it was amazing how much talking was going on.  The Magic Johnson Theater.  Goddamn.  God.  It is just a chore, though. 
[02:51:00]  What's all this slow music?  What?  I used to go in Brooklyn.  I used to go to the movie theater in Brooklyn.  It was just a nightmare for me.  And now I go to Great Neck, and it's just full of Jews.  And they don't talk during the movie.  They just sit there and watch the movie. 
[02:51:30]  Although I did see Downfall, which was a little odd watching it with a bunch of Jews.  And it's a Hitler bunker movie.  It's a Hitler bunker movie.  It's a motion at the theater, either.  I mean, more of the world.  People, why would you see it?  It was like parrots in there, but it was still, you know, you need that.  You need that energy.  You need that.  Was it a good movie?  We're hearing it.  I'm going to be honest with you.  It was two movies.  The greatest movie I ever saw in that particular alien thing, better than anything.  And the worst movie I ever saw because of that Dakota fan. 
[02:52:00]  And I've never wished a child was killed in a movie before.  You don't like the little Dakota fan?  She made me sick.  She's adorable.  She is, there's nothing childlike.  Like, there was no childlike.  I know.  She's a 30-year-old woman.  She's a 30-year-old woman.  She's like, Daddy?  Daddy?  Like, and Tom Cruise was so good in the movie because he was so, a non-hero.  He was just trying to keep his kids alive.  One is calling him by his first name, and he's trying to get him to call him Dad. 
[02:52:30]  And the other one's like, Daddy, are we going to live today, Dad?  It was like, you could see that when they said cut, she was going, Stephen, did I give  you what you needed on that particular?  She's like that on every interview.  On the award shows, you watch the award shows, she gives speeches.  She's like a 30-year-old woman trapped in a 10-year-old body.  She ruined the movie for me.  Really?  I'm telling you how bad she was in that movie.  You ever seen any other movies she's in?  The De Niro one?  Well, the horror movie there with De Niro. 
[02:53:00]  Didn't see that, saw Man on Fire, and she wasn't bad in that because she was kidnapped  through the entire movie.  Yeah, and didn't.  I've never wished a kid was like, please, please, please.  I'd like to see her in the JonBenet Ramsey story.  That'd be great, her with that little cowboy hat on and a garret around her throat.  Is that just wrong to say that about a kid?  Yeah, it probably is, yeah.  Like, but not her dead as a person, but in the movie, just.  In the movie, just have her killed.  Just get rid of her.  Right away. 
[02:53:30]  Early on.  The aliens, daddy.  Well, we're going to continue with Patrice O'Neal.  Are we plugging anything?  I'm doing Caroline's tonight with Voss.  Voss and Bonnie.  Oh, what time?  Right, the dynamic duo.  I don't know, whenever Voss crawls out of Bonnie's asshole for five seconds, we're going  to do a comedy show.  I want to go down there tonight.  Oh, you're doing the late show or whatever?  The late show is me, Greer, Voss, Bonnie, and whoever comes through.  Oh, tonight's a Friday.  I know, I'm thinking it's Wednesday.  I thought it was Wednesday, actually.  Oh, wow. 
[02:54:00]  Wednesday?  Oh, because we had a couple of days off.  Well, that was good.  We'll go to break with the Stephen Lynch song that kind of makes sense now, I guess.  It does?  It's a song about liking black chicks, basically.  A song for every occasion.  Ah, sure.  Let's listen to this.  A song about the truth.  I wrote it about a lady I was seeing not too long ago.  Hopefully I'll remember the lyrics.  Have a seat and listen. 
[02:54:30]  Please don't say a thing.  In matters of the heart, sometimes the truth will have a sting.  Just don't take it personally.  Finally, this is no attack, but we will never last because I'm white and you are also white.  I only like black girls, the brown girls, the cafe au lait.  The caramel girls and mocha girls just blow me away.  If you are newbie and I want you to be in every fantasy. 
[02:55:00]  But if you're a whitey, say nighty-nighty, you're just not the girl for me.  Woo-hoo.  Well, her body is a turn-on, curvaceous front and back.  Her hair is quite literally an aphrodisiac.  Don't call it jungle fever, because that just isn't right.  I am not a racist.  Some of my best friends are white.  I just prefer black girls, the brown girls, the cafe au lait. 
[02:55:30]  The caramel girls and mocha girls just blow me away.  Well, if you're a cracker, you better get blacker or else you best get out.  It is no mystery.  I like a sister.  See, that's what I'm talking about.  Ooh.  Oh, man, I hate vanilla ice cream.  White rice is so bland.  The milk chocolate melts in your mouth, not in your hand. 
[02:56:00]  But color is not the issue here.  It's dignity.  It's class.  It's all about her heart.  Okay, it's partly about that ass.  I want me some black girls, the brown girls, the cafe au lait.  The caramel girls and mocha girls just blow me away.  Well, if you're a honky, you're singing the wrong key.  It's the honest truth.  The skin that she's dwelling in must contain melanin.  That is the fountain of you.  Thomas Jefferson. 
[02:56:30]  Robert De Niro.  Well, strong thermal.  Strong thermal.  Yeah.  Nice.  Yes.  Thank you.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the ONA virus. 
[02:57:00]  We got human waste.  Where is that really crazy story before we go break?  Thank you, Eric.  Ooh.  Looks like somebody has rebounded from that UPN debacle.  Eric does a great job every day.  He really does.  Oh, well, hold on.  Young Timothy Hutton hair is pointing.  What happened, Derek?  Boy, Derek, I've never seen that young strapping buck jump up so fast.  That idea came from in here, just to let you know.  What idea?  About segging into that next story.  All right.  So I apologize.  Eric?  Wow. 
[02:57:30]  And they're all laughing.  No, but I gave you credit.  I thought you rebounded from a UPN failure.  But you wasn't going to interrupt and say, oh, yeah, Derek pointed that out while you were  talking.  In fairness to stupid, he didn't interrupt.  There's a whole competition going on behind the scenes.  Oh, and it's fantastic to watch.  Just the way a fucking young lawyer from a Grisham novel jumped up.  That way from this fucking part of the room.  That way from this fucking part of the organization.  We secretly hate that guy in there. 
[02:58:00]  There's just different worlds on either side of that glass, man.  Oh, boy.  It really is.  Oh, boy.  Look at they are rolling in there.  What happened?  You plugged your iPod into the computer?  Eric, what just happened?  Wow, you're panicking.  Oh, he is panicking.  I wasn't even touching it until I just started playing stuff.  No, stop it.  I swear, the gas, I hit the brake and the car lunged the head. 
[02:58:30]  How did it happen?  I killed 50 people on a pier.  Why was I driving on the pier?  I wasn't.  The car went left.  And the gas pedal.  I hit the brake and the gas went.  Weah.  Eric, you hit something.  Yes, you did.  Eric.  I didn't hit three miles at the same time.  You hit something.  What, are you thinking for yourself?  I have to play tic-tac-toe so we'll learn.  Shut up, stupid.  But you panicked.  Hello.  So let's... 
[02:59:00]  I'll play what I want, Eric.  I'll just play whatever I want.  Don't turn me off, Eric.  Wow, Hawk.  That was a panic of cataclysmic proportion.  What was the sauna playing?  That's the type of panic that in the army kills people.  That's a friendly fire panic.  Or in NASA, it blows a ship up.  Here, you just get your ears blown out a little bit  and a room full of laughter on the other side of the glass. 
[02:59:30]  It looks like a zoo back there.  Like they're all caged in glass.  And the name of that display is Really Happy White Guys.  Yep.  Oh, are they happy.  Pleased as punch.  Obi and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Ah, good old white music.  I'm actually enjoying, like, Norton's intro music to his shows, man.  It's like my new favorite. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, did you get it?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  It used to be, you know, Iron Man.  But now it's like Norton's intro.  I love that song.  It's got a national acrobat on Sabbath 27.  Of course it's Sabbath.  Yes.  But it has a beat to it.  Yeah, even this song is, as soon as you come out, they're like, yeah, Metallica.  Tell me about the boobah.  Metallica.  It's like the doo-doo-doo-doo.  You like that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  White guys rule.  We've got lots going on here.  Patrice O'Neill in studio.  Yeah.  What the hell are you laughing about off the air? 
[03:00:30]  The water thing?  You want to go down the road?  Oh, my God, yeah.  That was pretty interesting, actually.  You got it, because I can't imagine that type of mindset.  Absolutely.  Where some guy is telling you this, and he's serious.  So I do a show.  It's a private show.  Actually, it's not for Michael Dell.  It's for his money managers, who are super rich, and they get, I think, because I, you  know...  That's a corporate gig, basically.  It was a corporate gig.  And they were learning about me.  They were asking me black questions.  You know, what's it like to... 
[03:01:00]  It's like an exchange program, yeah.  Wow.  You know.  They get people like Patrice to entertain them in between their meetings and stuff.  Oh, no.  They had, and they had, in a room entertaining 20 people, blinded by the light.  What group is that?  Steve Miller Band.  They had them, like, in a room, playing this music in front of 20 rich people.  When you're all multi-gazillionaires, and you have a little party for yourself, you don't  just get some wedding band, or you get, like, Steve Miller, you know, you just pop them 
[03:01:30]  in a room.  God.  With the Christmas party?  Well, the Christmas party was funny, but that was because, you know, of all, tell that  really fast.  Bradley Delp, the singer from Boston.  Remember the band Boston?  One of the biggest bands, well, one of the biggest albums of all time, that first one.  Boston.  And he was playing Beatles, he was playing Beatle covers in a Beatle cover band for our radio  station's Christmas party up in Boston. 
[03:02:00]  So he's playing, this guy was selling out arenas in the 70s, had one of the biggest  albums ever.  Fast forward a few years, and it's Ant and I, and the rest of the dopey DJs at the station  with our dates, watching him do Beatles songs.  But should he not have been?  In front of 100 people.  Now, there's a difference between, like, you should be doing that, and you shouldn't.  Like, it's like, okay, you see that show on NBC with all the old bands, it used to be.  I would love that show.  It's like, they should be.  So maybe the guy from Boston should be doing that, because if he can't help it, you don't 
[03:02:30]  have a career, you don't have a career.  He said, and we talked to him, he said that's what he wants to do.  If he's still gotten that raise, if he's still got the royalty money rolling in from Boston,  and he's all set for life, and he likes Beatles tunes, wants to do that.  By the way, God bless him.  In all fairness, he does an unbelievable job, too.  Of course he did.  He's got a great voice.  At the end of the night, Ant can sing a tune or two.  He's up there drunk, just saying it was right.  I helped out.  And I got to say, I sang with the singer from Boston.  How about that?  Because by the third set, no one's paying attention, because it's a Christmas party. 
[03:03:00]  Everyone's hammering.  And here's this guy that used to be a rock silver star.  Built arenas in the 70s, yeah.  I want to be detached enough to just go make money.  That's why I'm just not, I don't have anything.  Because I can't get detached.  I get depressed.  You can't get detached from what, though?  Meaning I can't, like, I could, I should want to just go perform in front of a bunch of rich white people every five minutes.  Hey, Baba Doobah, Ba-dee-ba-bang, you know, man.  It was like a guy who did an, what is it, Dr. Evil guy.  He did that, and he gets paid, and he just, he just. 
[03:03:30]  Walks around like Dr. Evil.  He just muffled through it.  Ugh, ugh, million dollars.  And he got paid and left, and I'm trying to.  It was really him?  It was, no, it was.  Oh, precious.  You know, whatever.  Real fast, John in a story.  Let's get past this.  Go ahead, John.  Hey, what's up, guys?  I just want to let you know, it's not Steve Miliband.  It's Manfred Manzari's band that sang that song.  Oh, is that it?  He's right, too.  Just felt like correcting you.  All right, thanks, John.  Bruce redid it.  Thank you.  Whoever saw this.  I think Bruce did it originally, and then Manfred, I don't know.  And it was like, so I'm in front of these rich, I mean, like, Michael Dell was the richest of all. 
[03:04:00]  I mean, he was 20 billion, and everything.  20 billion with a B.  20 billion with a B.  And it trickles down, like, I was asking so many questions, like, how did you become this rich, you know?  And his whole thing, you know how he became rich, because you're talking about him today.  Yeah.  He cut out stores.  That's what he did.  He built the computers for 600 and sells them to you for 700.  Because he doesn't have stores.  It's all online.  Doesn't have stores.  Doesn't have blah, blah, blah.  That's why he's worth a billion dollars.  That's it.  So I'm in room, like, if somebody in there was worth three million, and I was talking to him, he goes, yeah, I own this business that I'm worth four million. 
[03:04:30]  I'm like, Jesus, you're like, hey, nigger.  Right?  I'm like, you're a joke, you poor son of a bitch.  So I'm talking to this guy, you know, everybody in there, Learjets and da-da-da, and they're at the table.  And it's fair enough, they're going to ask me black questions.  So I'm going to ask them white questions, which was much more important, you know what I mean?  Like, you know, saving money and things like that.  And I'm like, look, I ain't, I'm just trying to, I just bought a plasma TV for no reason at all. 
[03:05:00]  Because I, without a warranty.  So I go to the dude, he goes, yes.  I said, what do you do?  Well, I market different ideas.  Like, I met the guy who owns the rights to, what's the, SkyCam.  Really?  He owns SkyCam.  The rights to SkyCam.  The idea of SkyCam is his.  So when any news agency goes to the SkyCam, he's getting a check. 
[03:05:30]  That wire cam that flies around the NFL.  Right, that thing.  He owns that.  So I'm talking to guys like this.  So the guy goes, one guy goes, yeah, yeah, market different ideas.  I have an idea, we're marketing new water.  Marketing towards black people.  And I go, oh, really?  Hmm.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I go, so, I'm looking at him like, waiting for his face to go, ah, this guy.  Waiting for a punchline or something.  Nothing, he's dead serious.  So he goes, yes, we're thinking about calling it H2O. 
[03:06:00]  And I go, I'll sue you right now, motherfucker.  He looks at me because I thought it was a joke.  Right.  He looks at me like, you, ugh, who invited this low-class motherfucker?  Like it couldn't possibly be real, H2O.  Are you joking?  Like, I kept looking at him sideways.  You know how you talk to somebody and they say something?  Yeah.  And you need somebody else to look at, to go, is this nigga joking?  H2O, did you just say?  And he was dead serious. 
[03:06:30]  And that's who I was, like, dealing with, man.  It was just, it was an unbelievable adventure.  Yeah.  Because those were the white people.  When white people, black people talk about white people, that's them.  That's them.  It's not, like, just the average guy.  Right.  Walking on street going to work or something.  This karate guy or whatever.  No.  Yeah.  It's the guys, like, you know, who make decisions in life.  $20 billion.  Man, Michael Dell can't go broke.  That have no clue what's going on in the real world.  He can't go broke.  They said he's being sued by 40 people right now.  It's just, like, he can't go broke. 
[03:07:00]  That's just business as usual being sued by that many people.  Unbelievable.  It's like you cutting a check for, like, the electric company or something.  Yeah.  That's it.  It was good.  I like the idea of H2O.  I think that's actually a little big story.  H2O.  I like that.  He's going to market in Atlanta.  And I'm like, I'm sitting there going, man, are you serious, dude?  Wow.  And he's dead serious.  Is there a problem with it?  Like, I'm doing jokes.  This is these people.  I'm doing jokes.  Like, hey, so what's with these goddamn Indians at the airport?  How are these? 
[03:07:30]  I'm doing the Indian.  Now, hacky.  Hey, double, double, double, double, day.  And they're, like, looking like, I know this is supposed to be funny.  And I look at them.  I go, you mother.  Y'all don't know what here flies regularly?  They all fly Lear Jack.  They're so rich.  They don't even know.  They don't know what an airport is.  They don't understand what they're working to an airport.  You should have said something like, don't you hate when the caviar tumbles off the cracker?  That's pretty interesting. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, it was an unbelievable night.  Wow.  And the servant puts the salad fork on the inside.  Huggler, huggler, huggler.  And it seems like to us right now, it's like, oh, yeah, that's, that's, but it's like that.  Yeah.  It's really like that.  What is it when you run out of toilet paper or anything, anything human?  They have not a clue.  Like, Michael Dell will come up to me.  He was like, because they want to talk to a regular person.  And he was talking to me.  And I'm like, listen, do me a big favor.  Don't try to be down to earth with me. 
[03:08:30]  Could you not do that?  Can you allow, can you just stay some type of untouchable billion?  Don't put it this way.  Don't try to be my friend and not give me a million dollars.  Right.  If you're going to play that shit, cut me a check.  Exactly.  Do not try to be down to earth with me like a regular guy.  Did he hook you up with a free computer at least?  Nah, man.  I'm looking at, what is that?  Nah, it's not the water.  It's just another H2O product.  H2O.  You mean he's going to be in court fighting for the name?  But you know, 50 Cent owns, um.  It's a cheap, small, and effective, uh, noisemaker. 
[03:09:00]  Vitamin water.  You know that's 50 Cent.  Really?  Yeah, vitamin, you know vitamin water, right?  That's taking over the world, of course.  That's 50 Cent.  Wow.  Like, he needs more money, too.  He owns it.  Wow.  Well, you've got to give it to him.  I guess it works.  I hope I haven't messed it up for 50, where white people know they're drinking his water.  Yeah, right.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, one million spit cakes just happened.  What?  All right, we got some other things really fast. 
[03:09:30]  Anthony, we're doing this Assault on the Media contest.  Well, you don't tell me Biz Markie owns Smart Water.  It's, uh, the contest is officially on.  The month of July is the Assault on the Media contest.  I think I saw one last night online.  Yeah, that's the one I'm, uh, going to acknowledge here.  It's Buffalo Paul.  He's in the lead.  Yeah.  A hardcore fan of the show.  A pest.  Loves spreading the virus in many, many ways in the Buffalo area.  He's, he's a true pest of the Open Anthony Show, Anthony.  Uh, well, Buffalo Paul struck, uh, WGRZ-TV in Buffalo and NBC affiliate early, I guess, yesterday. 
[03:10:00]  Uh, he executed a flawless Assault on the Media, they're saying.  Yes, it was.  Actually, the video's up on Open Anthony.  I got fired either.  He got a sign behind reporter Claudine Ewing.  Photos and videos are up on OpenAnthony.com.  And the pest who pulls off the best Assault on the Media will win an XM MiFi and a whole  bunch of other cool stuff from the show.  We're still trying to figure that out, actually.  We want to do concert tickets or something, but it's a national contest, so we got to figure  out the prizes. 
[03:10:30]  But definitely a MiFi for the best Assault on the Media in the month of July.  And Buffalo Paul is certainly in the lead, okay?  I'm looking at it now, and look how he got the names in there, the faces.  He moves the sign so you can see the, uh, name.  Great job.  And he's wearing a official Open Anthony Spread the Virus t-shirt, Anthony.  Yes, he is.  That he could get through, uh, my brother.  That was a great, uh, Assault.  That link is also up on OpenAnthony.com, because my brother now has the pest t-shirts as  well, so.  Yes, uh, Jimmy? 
[03:11:00]  Isn't that great?  That's our thing.  That's a fucking crazy man.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I saw that in the news, like, everybody's, like, opiating their opi.  So annoying.  Oh, dude, that's our, yeah, that's our thing.  Pests.  Our thing, just to be annoying pests.  Somebody sold my satellite radio, so I don't even know anything.  They stole your satellite radio?  Yeah, broke into my truck, yeah.  They got opi's, too.  Yeah, they stole mine.  It's a hot item, I guess, to steal.  Jeez.  What the hell are they going to do with it?  It's a subscriber base.  It's like, who even, like?  They don't know what it is.  They just see a little thing mounted.  They think it's right out of the tech tower.  I think they think it's a navigation system or something, because. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  What can you really do with it if you steal it out of someone's truck?  And then in other Opie and Anthony news, our old producer, good old Rick, has a new job.  He does.  All right.  And he's making the news and TV in San Francisco.  Oh.  Tsunami song producer to start Bay Area Morning Show Monday on Wild 94.9.  Hmm.  The morning doghouse got canned for making offensive comments, and there's an even more controversial personality taking their place. 
[03:12:00]  At least there's not many Asians in San Francisco.  Yeah, what the fuck is he thinking?  Geez, he went to, like, Asian headquarters.  Actually, it's not even his fault.  You know, they decide to hire him there, and we wish him luck, obviously.  But yeah, there's a huge age.  Oh, man.  I didn't even think about that.  Giant.  San Francisco.  Yeah.  San Francisco.  San Francisco.  San Francisco.  Yeah.  That's whoever it is.  It's, uh, it's...  Yeah, they had to make him go all the way to San Francisco, man. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah, chased his ass all the way across the country.  But if he got kicked out of New York, which is, you know, the worst place you can be in  terms of people and what they'll deal with, he's went to, oh, PC San Francisco?  I know.  Oh.  Oh, they're gonna love his friggin' gay songs and stuff.  Oh, poor Rick.  I'm so gay.  I'm so gay.  Remember that one?  We loved that one.  With his AIDS references and everything else.  Oh, they'll love him there.  So, a lot of controversy.  I think he's just hoping that all the people that listen don't have the strength to pick up  the phone because they're having a bad day. 
[03:13:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I'd love to complain, but I'm just gonna pet my dog and wait for my friend to come over.  Oh, my God.  A little sharp-handed laugh.  Oh, he's gonna have a good time in San Francisco.  By the way, Clay and Mrs. Sippy wants in.  Go ahead, Clay.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, I was just wondering if this H2O was gonna be packaged as a 40.  Here we go.  I can't believe that a stereotypical cracker voice would make a stereotypical... 
[03:13:30]  It's like, I want areas of 40.  I can't believe.  Are you driving an Indy car while you're saying that, you dick?  Dude, we gotta get one caller from Alabama before you get out of here.  Goddamn.  Let me tell you.  Goddamn, H2O.  A 40?  Oh, you make it sound like a good actor.  You gotta hear the real people from Alabama.  Here's one of Rick's songs, by the way.  Oh, which one?  He's gonna be in the San Francisco market.  All right, San Francisco.  Here's what you can expect from our own Rick Delgado.  Why y'all doing that? 
[03:14:00]  His voice, his words.  Wow.  Welcome to Frisco.  It's a great way to lose some weight on our way to Christopher Street.  Why don't you have him cancel his ticket, Ms. Anderson?  Dead in days. 
[03:14:30]  Legion's all over my face.  Legion?  Hound my angst and grab some A-D-D.  You can watch my life wither away on our way to Christopher Street.  And how does he call him?  On our way to Christopher Street.  On our way to Christopher Street.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  How do you get past one verse?  Right.  Like he's brainstorming.  Wither away.  Yeah, lesions. 
[03:15:00]  In all fairness.  I think he wrote down AIDS key phrases.  Dude, in all fairness, we love that song.  It makes us laugh a lot.  Oh.  But we've...  You just got him fired.  What do you think that's like that?  You just got him picketed.  Oh, they are not going to play that when he gets there, I'm sure.  Somebody has drawn a picket sign right now.  Knowing Rick, though, he's the type of guy that'll start the show, you know...  With that.  Is he going to be on the air, or is he just producing, or I don't know what the deal is,  but he'll start with that thing, and it's okay.  Hey, this is great. 
[03:15:30]  Play this.  But anyway, it's big news in San Francisco and in the radio community, and I guess the  news is all over in San Francisco.  I got the story in front of me.  So Rick Delgado, the twice-fired former producer of Opie and Anthony, and Miss Jones in the  Morning will produce Strawberry in the Morning, starting Monday at 6.  Strawberry in the Morning?  Delgado was the guy behind broadcasting a couple allegedly having sex in St. Pat's Cathedral.  Really?  So Miss Jones is going to San Francisco, too?  No, no, no.  Just in... 
[03:16:00]  You know, they all copy each other, so...  Yeah, I think he was saying that he's the former producer of Miss Jones' show is going  to San Francisco for the strawberry, what?  Strawberry in the Morning.  Oh, is that him?  Strawberry in the bum rush.  Oh, Strawberry's not even a chick?  No, Strawberry's a guy.  Oh, God.  I was ready to say Strawberry's hot.  Thank God I didn't say that, because there's a chick in the picture.  So I'm assuming she's got to be Strawberry.  Let's see.  Delgado was the guy behind broadcasting a couple allegedly having sex in St. Pat's Cathedral, 
[03:16:30]  and the one who created a song that made fun of Asian tsunami victims.  Now, that song was funny.  Come on.  Go find your mommy.  Yeah.  Everyone knows it now.  A tree right through your head.  All they did was just list real facts.  Right.  Put it to music.  There's a big old way.  The mistake he...  Get ready to drown you, and you can't breathe, because you're underwater, and your lungs are  filled with stuff.  The mistake he made was, he had that song written, and the tragedy wasn't even 24 hours old. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, the second it happened.  Wait a little while.  Just go find your mommy.  Child slavery.  But what's her name, Angelina?  A double-decker bus.  It just exploded.  It just exploded.  In Liverpool Station.  Screaming Limey's coming out of the subway with blood on their faces.  A mommy-less Christmas.  Jesus.  Run, you Limey, run.  And Angelina Jolie is adopting all those tsunami kids, by the way. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah, she's grabbing them all up.  Jesus.  Like they're going to be worth something.  How about a black kid or something?  Something.  Help out.  Somebody American, third world American.  Get a Puerto Rican.  What is that, strawberry?  Yeah, this gets a little more interesting.  The story, okay, station exec Kim Bryant tells a story that explains why she made this  controversial hire.  Oh, she has to explain herself.  Because a lot of people thought that Rick was not going to get hired ever again.  Unhireable, just like us.  She explains.  The story comes from Clear Channel executive Ed Cramp, whose father was hospitalized with 
[03:18:00]  a heart problem.  Yeah.  Well, Cramp, because it's M-P-F, so I...  Cramp?  I think it's just Cramp.  Cramp.  Was in the hospital room and...  Don't try to say his own name.  Cramp was in the hospital room and saw his father looking worse.  He told a nurse and the nurse said his father looked all right.  Then his father went code blue and had to be treated immediately.  The next day, a nursing supervisor told Cramp that they would have another nurse take  over his father's care.  But Cramp said no.  He wanted the same nurse, the one who had learned his lesson, to continue caring for 
[03:18:30]  his dad.  Oh, I got ya.  So, the guy that learned his lesson is going to do a better job...  Because he learned that lesson.  Because he learned his lesson than the guy, the new guy you bring in that hasn't learned  his lesson.  I thought they wanted Rick to carry out his fucking, his bedpan or something.  Yeah, I thought they wanted Rick to write a song.  He went code blue.  Breathe, you fucker! 
[03:19:00]  Breathe!  That's it.  Wow, that's very profound.  Join Rick Delgado with his, as he joins us with his CD called Obvious.  But then it goes on here.  That's an important story for all of us, said Bryant.  This is Kim Bryant.  The best person for the job may be the one who has learned from his mistakes.  So says Cramp.  It's a gutsy move by Bryant, the highest ranking female on local radio who oversees 11 clear  channel stations, including blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[03:19:30]  Clear channel hired Rick?  Yeah.  Wow.  I wish there was more women like that in the business.  Yeah.  She's pretty cool.  I can't hate her for that.  That's a good move.  Dude, I applaud them.  I give them credit, you know.  Did you guys learn their lesson?  Well, no.  No, you know what?  People think we learned our lesson because, you know, we're not sending people into church  to have sex.  But it's not even about learning a lesson.  We're just as big of douchebags as we were then. 
[03:20:00]  But now we're just a little smarter.  We'll just get fired for some reason.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  I want at least, you know, a little more time where I'm getting a paycheck coming in.  That's about it.  And then we'll blow it up.  Because it's 2020.  Oh, my God.  You can't really figure out who's offended by what.  There's some Delgado quotes.  Oh, great.  And he loves the spotlight, so he's loving this today.  Brian says, Delgado and the new show featuring local DJ Strawberry and Faye Carmona, last in  Miami, will be more community-oriented and listener-friendly than The Doghouse, the show that 
[03:20:30]  we're replacing.  What she said got to be more about the host and the community.  Uh-oh.  In a surprising interview.  Surprising.  Oh, boy.  Should I snap in?  Should I snap in?  I took my seatbelt off when I went to the bathroom.  I think I should buckle in for one of Rick's comments.  Rick was always known for his ridiculous quotes to the media.  Remember how he described our show?  That's legendary.  Yeah.  If you're not laughing in the first 20 minutes, this show isn't for you. 
[03:21:00]  Thanks, Rick.  In the first 20 minutes?  We have inside jokes that people that have been listening for two years don't fucking  get.  There are people that will finally start listening, start laughing, yes, two years later because  they finally get one of our stupid inside jokes or movie references.  And then realize how brilliant we actually are.  We make movie references no one understands until they see the movie a year later.  20 minutes, give them.  Thanks, Rick.  Yeah, this show is never about trying to hit them with a laugh right away.  It's a whole thing that goes on. 
[03:21:30]  It's a whole, it's, dare I say it's a culture.  It's an Opie and Anthony culture.  So here's a surprising interview.  In a surprising interview, Delgado said he thinks he was misinterpreted and wrote a song  that was only in bad taste but not racist, even though it used an epithet for Chinese people.  Epithet.  He said he won't do that again because, and I quote, I like their food and want to eat  in the restaurants.  Jesus.  I'll say, I'll say. 
[03:22:00]  He just doesn't learn.  At least, at least wait for the first day on the job.  He's not even working yet.  And listen to this.  He also recalled that shock jock Howard Stern called him a scumbag.  Oh, yeah?  What?  When did that happen?  I don't know.  I really don't know.  I don't know how much that says, he added.  Is he remarked that Ben Sparks also called him the same thing on a daily basis? 
[03:22:30]  Hey, Rick got hired.  Ben and Steve obsessed with Rick.  Absolutely obsessed.  I don't know what he thinks he's going to do in San Francisco.  He's probably gossiping already online.  Oh, man.  Chatty Cathy's all of them.  Y'all are really silently getting this boy's career destroyed.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he's finishing San Francisco.  Nah, he'll be all right.  We love Rick.  Yeah, I do like the kid.  And he does a good job.  Come on.  When they play the tsunami and they play this song, the Sesame Street gay song. 
[03:23:00]  Oh, it's over.  Brian said he would be monitored closely to make sure it didn't happen again.  And then Christine Chan, executive director of the National Organization of Chinese Americans,  said her group will also closely monitor the show.  Oh, great.  He's sunk.  An Asian woman.  You know they have a great sense of humor.  Yeah.  Where's his other song?  Asian women are like.  Which song?  I'm so gay.  I'm so gay.  I'm so gay.  That's old school.  Damn.  All right. 
[03:23:30]  And then I guess you could comment about Rick's hiring.  Yeah.  Because that was an online article.  And then, you know, you could comment about the articles you read.  Of course.  Here's a couple of the comments.  Clear Channel has some nerve to hire him in a market with a huge Asian population.  Oh, there you go.  He must have agreed to work for Pennies, where Clear Channel is pretty darn desperate.  As a 21-year-old male, I'm boycotting Wild 94.  Not a 21-year-old male said that?  No.  Darn, pretty darn desperate.  No way.  No way that's a 21-year-old guy that wrote that.  The next comment. 
[03:24:00]  San Francisco will love Rick.  He's just right for the people there.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  But then the next one is the one making me chuckle.  This morning's show will be so good, I can't wait to tune in.  Tell him, Fred.  Really?  People are commenting.  That's great.  What in the world is 94.9 thinking?  This is preposterous and unthinkable with the horrid rap sheet that this guy has had. 
[03:24:30]  The Bay is home to diversity and the appreciation of different backgrounds, genders, and ethnicity.  Ethnicity.  Ethnicity.  Ethnicity.  This decision will not only lead me to boycott the station, but to also tell other members of the Asian community to beware of what has come about to this station.  To this station.  No one needs you.  Bear in mind.  The Asians really don't have much of a pull.  And they're not, listen, they do not, I'm, I'm, that's what I couldn't understand from the Hot 97 thing.  It's like, when did Asians get fear, pal? 
[03:25:00]  When did we start worrying about?  When did that happen?  Like, what do they buy?  Nothing.  What do people market to Asians for them to destroy a show?  Exactly, besides very small condoms.  And fucking bowls for their hairdos.  But Senator, uh, yeah.  The only thing that Asians make me laugh is that when there's an Asian with an American first name and their regular last name.  Like, like, uh, Jacqueline Wu.  Arthur Chien. 
[03:25:30]  Teddy Cho, line three.  Peter Cho.  Yeah, what's that all about?  Teddy Cho, line three.  Oh, my God.  Marty Yang.  Marty Yang.  Let's go to Marty Yang for the story.  I don't, stop it.  You know, it's a white dad and an Asian mother.  Yeah.  I don't want to lose all my culture.  All right, we'll keep the last name.  Oh, Marty Yang.  Yes, this is Marty Yang. 
[03:26:00]  And I like to say, what?  Marty Yang?  Stop it.  Your name's Marty.  Spell your name.  Uh, two squiggle lines.  Oh.  Four bricks and a question mark tied in a knot.  Yeah, all of a sudden they got, like, fear power.  Where people now, you know, you got to, oh, watch out.  They're going to boycott.  Yeah, they're going to boycott.  I mean, not to say they can't make, I mean, they got, they got people fired from the step,  but, I mean, it's a lot of them, but they're not up there yet.  Like, the top, the top fear goes to Jews. 
[03:26:30]  I said this before.  I think black, I think black.  Top, don't, black is second.  No, I think black is first.  Absolutely not, man.  Not a society.  People, Jews get you fired.  Black people make you nervous, and they could get you fired.  You come off looking like a racist, it's worse than coming off looking like an anti-Semite.  Anti-Semite, absolutely not.  No effing way.  I think so.  And show business, I got to agree with Patrice, I'll tell you why.  All right.  Because when you look at Marlon Brando.  The Jews run the business?  Well, yeah.  Well, but Marlon Brando said it wrong, but what he was saying is every ethnicity has 
[03:27:00]  been stereotyped, the blacks, the Italians, everything but Jews.  He's like, you never see that stereotype portrayed in films like you would black exploitation movies  or The Godfather or Goodfellas.  You never see that Jewish stereotype.  I would have to agree and say that that's the most.  You think if there were three Jews walking in Howard Beach and one of them got beat over  the head with a bat, do you honestly think there'd be an outrage?  And marches and reverenal type? 
[03:27:30]  Different kind of, it's like black people, people are afraid of black people's markets.  You can just stop right there.  They're afraid of our, as a group, when we galvanize to not like something.  Come in the neighborhood, yeah.  They're afraid of Jews in terms of, uh-oh, did he just say anti-Semite?  There will, I think celebrities should be more afraid of Jews, maybe.  Maybe the average racist should be more afraid of black people.  We'll give and take.  We'll give and take.  I think as far as, well, maybe I'm just thinking more on a personal level as far as radio goes. 
[03:28:00]  Let's say radio.  You should be more afraid of Jews than black people.  No, I think, I'm with Patrice.  I think, no.  Yeah, you know why?  Because if there's a Jew that's in charge of the radio station, let's say, he will definitely  take it as, yeah, let's just say there is.  The CEO of this company.  He will take what is being said, even if it's negative as far as Jews go, because it's working,  it's getting ratings, and it's making money. 
[03:28:30]  Let's just say.  But you're talking about the one Jew who's making the money.  The one that's making the decision whether to pull the plug based on complaints.  Like, you know how a beach thing?  I think if you hit, like, no one likes the curly Q-Jews, the ones with the coats walking  around.  People just want to see them get beat on top of their stupid top hats.  The Hasidic.  The Hasidic.  The Hasidic community.  With the curly fries.  The Hasidic.  On top of their stupid top hats.  Give me that dumb top hat. 
[03:29:00]  I think we keep going.  We're going to find out what's worse.  All right.  You know what?  But it's like, it's like, you know, black, I agree.  Black people in terms of, like, that's why, like, Abner Louima, Amadou Diallo, this is  why, now look, I tend to believe that those particular cases are worse than Rodney King.  That's what I feel.  Right.  Shot 41 times and the plunge in your ass.  But they're African and Haitian. 
[03:29:30]  Right.  They're not, they don't, they ostracize themselves from black people.  When black people get on your ass, it's serious business.  But do we get on your ass in terms of a social, in the street level?  Oh, you did this to a black person, so a cop choked a black kid, so we're going to come  after him.  Uh-huh.  The albanized.  But when it comes to this, show business or one guy saying something and this anti-Semitic  put on it, you're done.  But blacks can get it in the news and keep shit in the news and pressure it over the 
[03:30:00]  long haul where you are, you know, you just whittle away at the bosses wherever you are  and you wind up getting your ass thrown out of there for something you said.  The only difference with Howard Beach is I don't think that Jews being beat up would  tap into that white guilt.  And I think that's a big problem with women, because there's such a history, like, the liberal  whites get so guilty.  And I'm not blaming all liberals, I'm just saying that that white guilt comes out, and  that's why, because black people don't really fire you, they complain until the white people  running it fire you.  That's basically the way it is, and it taps into that white guilt. 
[03:30:30]  Well, look what happened.  I think the black guy that beat up Yankle Rosenbaum, he just got out of it.  Yankle Rosenbaum.  Yeah.  Beat him up?  He beat up a Jew?  Beat him up.  Is this guy Yankle a Jew?  Killed him.  Killed him.  Well, he, like, they did make an error at the hospital, too, and he wound up dying.  They didn't find a stab wound for hours later.  Oh, really?  You know, so they were saying, yeah, he...  Ah, he's just complaining, that's what they do.  Yeah, hi.  Hi, Sider.  Hi.  Hi.  I feel a pain, always complaining. 
[03:31:00]  The man plunged the knife into me?  Oh, my God.  Well, you're finding the stab wound, my shoulder hurts.  Gives me pain, but I don't want to complain.  I mean...  Jesus.  Just a stab wound.  Just a stab wound.  But he just recently got out, and I think if it was the other way around, and it was reversed, 
[03:31:30]  I think if a white guy was getting out of prison, you'd hear a little more about it.  Like, why is this guy getting out?  He killed a black guy.  You know, why...  I think in those terms, you get more flack from the black community.  I really don't...  White guilt again, though, because Leverick Nelson's black.  Whatever the case is, you're getting less flack.  Look at this thousand-year-old white boy, they're just now putting them for the Mississippi  burning thing.  Yeah.  It's like...  What is that, some sorry Negroes?  Here's a little something for you.  A little something for you.  Here's a little something, Negroes.  Here's a little something. 
[03:32:00]  Time to rejoice.  Oh, praise Jesus.  They locked them.  They locked them.  Lord, they locked them up.  They finally have Gene Hackman's is happy.  William Dafoe is happy.  That's what they did to move him, folks.  That old guy, he lived his life.  Who cares?  He's 9,000...  A 9,000-year-old racist.  Can't tankerous old fellow.  They're going to shake his fist at the cameras.  You know those white, the prison gangs?  They're going to make him an honorary, the honorary, like, Buddha.  I'll be the head-muckety-muck. 
[03:32:30]  We got us a hero coming in today, boys.  What would you have done in the 60s?  Yeah.  This nigga stole my goddamn pack of cigarettes.  What would you have done in the 60s?  We'd have burned that goddamn church down.  Holy shit.  What's this newfangled shankin' you doing?  What's this newfangled shankin'?  With a toothbrush, a sharpened toothbrush?  Well, goddamn. 
[03:33:00]  We should have killed them goddamn three civil rights workers with a sharpened toothbrush.  Well, thank you, gentlemen.  I love when they put him in front of, like, a woman, black, Asian judge, too.  They get, like...  Where, you know, he's just sitting there going,  My hand, my life is in this goddamn mixed-breed hands.  Goddamn.  She gonna be the one to send me off to prison?  And, you know, he was so back in the 60s, he's like,  All right, do you please guilty?  I'm guilty. 
[03:33:30]  I did it.  Of course.  I kept that niggas and them two nigga-lovers.  You see, I made a movie.  I was Michael Rooker.  Remember the judge in Mississippi, Bernie?  These were caused by outside influences.  We're not condoning them, mind you.  Mind you.  I played that Michael Rooker role.  People think I was Stephen Dorff.  I wasn't.  You'd kill, would you, Frank? 
[03:34:00]  I wouldn't think about it no more than I would snap at a cat's neck.  This is a private social club.  Oh, my God.  And ask them if they want to help save this country from the onslaught of integration.  You know, the system is they want to throw white children and colored children into the building part of integration,  throughout of which will come a conglomerated, the latter, Mongol class of people. 
[03:34:30]  All of races will be destroyed in such a movement.  I, for one, after God will die before I yield one end.  That guy has some passion.  You know, they're nodding their heads at each other.  That was in 1965.  It's like, okay, when did that stop?  At what point did his children say to their children,  hey, man, you can't be making these speeches. 
[03:35:00]  It's like people are thinking the same thing today.  You just can't get up on a soapbox, and you can't find a soapbox, mind you.  Mongrels.  Mongrel race.  They changed the word mongrel to rap music.  What?  Rap music.  Damn rap music.  Rappers.  A mulata.  Platino race.  Oh, just horrible.  Disgusting.  There's more on Rick. 
[03:35:30]  Oh.  How did we get there?  That was actually Rick's clip.  He's writing a song about it.  They did an exclusive interview with Rick.  Conglomerated mongrel race.  Rick never really talked.  Rick never talked to the media after the tsunami song getting fired.  He gave this newspaper an exclusive interview.  You know the deal with the tsunami song.  I'm sure even the new listeners heard the controversy.  Our old producer wrote a song going out to the tsunami victims.  Got himself fired. 
[03:36:00]  In an exclusive interview with the Mercury News first reporter on mercurynews.com,  Delgado said his earlier actions were edgy but misinterpreted.  Of course.  And added that he wouldn't change his act very much for the news station.  That's good.  Smart thing to say going in.  Jesus, Rick.  Smart.  Don't change.  I'm not going to change.  Sex in a church.  Tsunami songs.  Sure.  Why not?  That's not what.  AIDS songs.  You got to learn your lesson in the end.  You got to say, look, I screwed up.  It went way too far.  You know.  Or do what I do. 
[03:36:30]  Don't say much.  You don't say anything.  And then once you get the job again and you're here for a while, then you say,  ah, we didn't care.  We're not sorry.  There you go.  It was a matter of bad taste like a blonde joke, Delgado said, of the tsunami song.  Right.  He's comparing his tsunami song to a blonde joke.  To a blonde joke.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sure.  How many orphaned children does it take to screw in a life hole?  I don't know.  300,000?  Oh.  It's a blonde joke.  Sure.  Same thing. 
[03:37:00]  Now, blonde jokes and tsunami jokes.  Let's see.  Same thing.  Oh, man.  You hear about the blonde that climbed a palm tree and watched her boyfriend drown?  No?  She owned it.  Oh, when they saw that wave coming, I bet you the eyes got big then.  They opened right off those little slits.  Oh.  Oh, what's coming?  Oh, another classic Delgado quote.  It was a matter of bad taste like a blonde joke, Delgado said, of the tsunami song, which 
[03:37:30]  was set to the tune of We Are the World and made a joke of people dying in the December  26 tsunami.  Delgado said the song was meant to parody a then-promised tsunami song by Sharon Stone and  Sharon Osbourne.  His job is to say he won't be censored, but he will be, said Brian.  Yeah.  Obviously, there's already tension because she's like, you know, the reporter called her and  said, this is what your new hire said.  And now she's like, he said, what?  Yeah, what?  Oh, boy.  Well, his job is to say he won't be censored, but he will be. 
[03:38:00]  Oh, no, really?  Yeah, but in her head, she's like, what the fuck?  What is this guy?  What is he?  Is he?  Rick.  Rick, and then she goes on, we are in it for the long run, we're going to protect our  license, and we are here for the community and the listeners.  The tsunami song, obviously, people got fired, Rick.  How much experience did Rick have when he was working with you guys?  On our show?  I mean, to you guys.  Like, did you go, okay, that's funny, Rick.  Or did you go, like, could you go, Rick, beat it?  I don't like that.  Oh, beat it all the time.  Yeah, all the time.  Like, he just made decisions on what you thought was funny. 
[03:38:30]  All the time.  That's why, you know what?  He should not have been fired for the tsunami song.  His job is to, you know, as a producer, is to hand in stuff.  And then the host, whether it was Anthony and I at the time, or Miss Jones and that  crew, then it's up to her to decide, well, should we go with this or not?  But do all hosts have that?  Did she think she had that?  Oh, God, yeah, Miss Jones.  That's why she's the biggest pussy in radio, and she will get destroyed now, because she  has been, you know, made out to be a phony.  She's a phony.  She's an absolute phony.  Rick shouldn't have been fired.  She should have been fired.  There's no producer that comes running over. 
[03:39:00]  Could you see a producer running over, shoving a CD in there, and hitting play without the  host, knowing that it's going to happen?  You mean in taking charge?  Not on this show.  No, absolutely not.  Go and play this!  She was all brave that day.  She was going to hold you against the wall with his hog.  She was brave that day.  Like, she backed that song and played it like it was hers.  Like it was hers.  And even had a little rift with the Asian person on the, uh, what happened?  Just, what happened?  Ben walking into this studio is hysterical. 
[03:39:30]  Is this kid black?  He got, we don't know what he is.  We don't know what he is.  He's like that Seinfeld.  He's got bigger hair, man.  He's like that Seinfeld episode.  White boy with nappy hair.  What the hell's wrong with him?  I'm just a white boy with good hair.  No, you're.  But you have like, yeah, there's something going on where you got.  You're 1% black.  You have some black in you.  Something going on.  Yeah.  Take you to Maury Povich.  I hope you're a white mama.  Yeah, you're 1% black.  Did you ever look back into your history?  Your family history?  Exactly.  They did look back.  Is your grandmother like hip hop?  They haven't found any black people, but they found Thomas Jefferson in there, so. 
[03:40:00]  Well, are you serious?  Yeah, sure to go.  Yeah, so then, well, Jefferson's been known to knock off.  Wait, you're related to Thomas Jefferson?  You sure it's not George?  Do you get anything for being related to Thomas Jefferson?  No.  Bragging rights.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's been known to knock off a couple of slave girls, though, in his day.  So I've heard.  They came forward and said that he was doing that, so.  Yeah, it's obvious.  So I think if you got some Thomas Jefferson in you, I think something was going on there. 
[03:40:30]  You happy about that, you little coon?  Lucky me.  You little moon cricket, porch monkey?  Do you get invited to the picnic every year?  There's like a Thomas Jefferson picnic every year.  Yeah.  No.  No?  No.  Any other family members with that hair?  I got, yeah, I have an uncle.  An uncle?  Just like me on my mom's.  No?  Hank.  Uncle Hank, and he's got the same hair as you.  But everybody else has straight hair? 
[03:41:00]  My brother's hair is curly, but not like mine.  Yeah.  Loose.  You got a big dick?  All right.  Yeah?  It's a good size.  He's a little scrawny dude.  Yeah.  Scrawny guy.  All right.  We're running out of show.  We want to just wrap this up so we can move on.  So Brian had to defend, you know, Rick's comments in the paper.  People got fired.  It was meant to be a bad spoof of celebrities and telethons.  Delgado said, my job is to put stuff out there and see what gets a reaction.  Hopefully people will get a kick out of it.  Yeah.  He got a kick right on his ass.  And then they talked to this Asian lady, you know, that runs the Asian group out there. 
[03:41:30]  And she's like, the use of racial slurs is simply unacceptable no matter what one's ethnicity is.  And Delgado, who is of Spanish and Puerto Rican descent, said he thought racial humor was still acceptable  so long as the person making fun of a race is of that race.  Oh, no.  What's your favorite racial slur?  Mine?  What's just the best racial slur?  I think gook is.  I just think gook is the funniest racial slur.  Gook is a funny one. 
[03:42:00]  That's a nice thing.  I'm serious.  Sure ain't the one I use the most.  You know, I find gook funny, but the one I use the most, eh, when I'm driving and I'm cut off.  You guys schooled me on this producer.  I thought producers had power.  No, not at all.  I like to call somebody if they don't do what I want, like a lazy Keith.  Ah, there you go.  We only got a minute left.  We got to get this live read in for Paisano.  Hey, like the song says, you'll love Paisano.  It's a great restaurant right in the heart of Little Italy.
