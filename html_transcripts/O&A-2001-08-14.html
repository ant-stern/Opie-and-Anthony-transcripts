<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with commercials for Optimum Online and Stacker 2.  The hosts then discussed their contrasting childhoods – Opie's impoverished upbringing versus Anthony's more affluent background – leading to reminiscences about school lunches, smells, and school supplies.  This segued into a discussion of "random wood" (unexpected erections), with numerous callers sharing their own experiences.  The conversation then shifted back to Stephanie McMahon's breast augmentation, fueled by caller comments and on-air photos.  Listeners shared their own childhood sexual awakenings, and a caller, Stacey, recounted an ambiguous interaction with Opie at a high school reunion.  The segment ended with promotion of the "WOW Summit" motorcycle ride, a news story about Israeli soldiers using stripteases as a decoy, and an update on Earl's traffic stop with a drunk intern, followed by a call from Earl himself.

The show continued with a detailed account of Earl's speeding ticket incident, involving a very intoxicated passenger, Marty.  Earl's alleged poor behavior at promotional "sticker stops" was then discussed, escalating into a heated exchange between Earl and the hosts.  Earl revealed workplace frustrations and anger towards sales staff, even mentioning breaking O2Go bottles.  The hosts attempted to mediate, jokingly suggesting "Old Dirty Bastard" as a replacement.  Jay Moore and Kimmy from Survivor were in-studio guests.  Ian, the writer of the New York Magazine article about the show, was interviewed.  This was followed by a phone interview with Stephanie McMahon, focusing heavily on her breast implants, wrestling storylines, and sexually suggestive jokes.  A humorous anecdote about interviewing Jimmy "Superfly" Snooker was shared.  The segment included audio clips, including a Ben Affleck Sam Adams commercial.

The next segment opened with a call from Scorch, a Syracuse radio host, complaining about being ignored by Opie and Anthony.  He shared anecdotes about wrestlers, including Chyna and Triple H, and promoted his own "totally nude" radio show.  The conversation touched on Britney Spears and Stephanie McMahon's breast implants again.  The hosts then discussed Jamie Lynn Sigler's Maxim photos with graphic sexual comments.  They attempted to contact her brother to have her on the show.  The segment featured a contentious interaction with Earl, culminating in him throwing a phone and damaging office property.  Jay Moore called in to promote his show, followed by a call from Jamie Lynn Sigler's brother.  The segment concluded with numerous commercial breaks.

The final segment focused on the hosts' recent interview with Bill O'Reilly. They discussed O'Reilly's concerns about the show's morality and potential negative influence, contrasting them with their own humorous and often inappropriate responses.  Anthony recounted laughing during O'Reilly's serious questions and delivering a rant against organized religion.  They debated whether their show influenced negative behaviors.  The discussion included tangents about the Olsen twins, drug use, the cancellation of Jackass, a caller's extremely offensive message, the New York Magazine article detailing various show segments ("Whipping Mount Wednesday," "F.U. Friday," "Cripple Bouts"), Stephanie McMahon's breast implants, and Opie's masturbation, including a call from his girlfriend, Sandy, about the incident.  Jim Norton was in the studio throughout.  Psycho Mark (a Fox News employee) and upcoming guests Jay Moore and potentially someone from the WWF were mentioned.  The show concluded with promotion of a meet-and-greet at a Hooters location and the mention of Dickie Betts' arrest for domestic battery.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie, I'm the dick. Anthony, I'm an ass.  Why are you wasting your time with this sleazy trash?  People are starting to say funniest radio ever, so don't wreck it.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  So, here's one for Bill O'Reilly. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, see, it had nothing to do with women.  See, there's a break that has nothing to do with sex, Mr. O'Reilly.  The O'Reilly Factor.  Bill O'Reilly.  Hi.  The O'Reilly Factor.  If you're not in the New York area and you want to get a hold of the show today, 866-277-4WOW.  It's all ants in the studio, Jim Norton in the studio.  We're ready to rock.  We took off yesterday to get a little rest and relaxation. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  I hung out and did nothing.  Same here.  I watch TV.  We picked the worst weekend to have a three-day weekend.  Rain the whole time.  Yeah, a little nasty.  Oh, well, what are you going to do?  Who cares?  So, uh, we taped an interview with Bill O'Reilly today.  Bill O'Reilly, the O'Reilly Factor.  Now, your show consists of a lot of sex.  Yeah, Bill.  People like sex.  Like having it, like doing it, like watching it. 
[00:01:30]  Whatever.  We did, we did okay.  I was waiting to see springs and steam come out of his head.  Boing.  I am not human.  We did all right.  Oh, yeah.  Something like we did okay.  Some of the questions he was trying to get real serious, you know, about, uh, morality and all that.  And as he's asking the question, I just start going, I'll be laughing.  I just start laughing.  Now, what if a young child of, let's say, 12 years old is listening to the program and feels compelled to maybe do some of the things that, like, hey, Bill, it ain't our problem. 
[00:02:00]  It's not our problem.  What is it?  The Opie and Anthony Daycare Center?  Let me check.  Nah.  What if kids hear you?  Exactly.  The children.  We'll see what they, um, they make out of the interview.  They still have the, the last say because they can edit and stuff, but, uh.  Yeah.  And had, and had, uh, it was pretty much the, the stopper. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  I bow to you today.  It diffused any other question that he was going to ask us in that interview.  And I hope he, he makes sure he includes your, uh, your little, um, rant on, um, organized religion.  Hey, there you go.  I mean, but, you know, with this show, other forms of entertainment in the same,  genre, kind of get, uh, a bad rap because we're influencing, or supposedly we're influencing  people to do things. 
[00:03:00]  When we have naked women on here, Opie, do you know it influences people out there to  rape women and beat them over the head?  When we say, hey, Norton, stop being a fag, uh, people instantly pick up hammers and, and  start beating homosexuals over the head.  Uh, all that stuff.  It just happens for some reason.  I really wish that were true.  Oh my God.  Jesus, Jim.  Awful.  It's early.  It's 310.  Help us out here.  Yeah.  Well, that's what the mainstream media would like, uh, to think, I guess.  So I just brought up the fact to, uh, Bill O'Reilly that, and that nothing's been proven 
[00:03:30]  as far as that goes.  Entertainment, if it contributes to violence and sexual deviancy or anything like that.  But I, I do know one thing that is proven to make people do things, and that's religion.  See, if people go to church, they listen to their clergymen, you read your Bible, the  Koran, whatever the hell you're into these days, and you strap bombs on yourself and run  into restaurants, or you take a rifle and you start, uh, shooting up abortion clinics,  because that's what, uh, you know, your interpretation of what the priest told you or what you read in 
[00:04:00]  the Bible, you know?  But I don't see anybody turning around and saying, oh, my God, we got to stop this religion  stuff, because that's a little hard.  That stone's been rolling for a while, you know?  It was nice.  And, and it, it pretty much just, it eliminates the argument.  It really does.  Where's the outcry for organized religion to be, uh, halted or stopped or investigation  into whether it's causing violence or anything like that? 
[00:04:30]  No.  I said the easy thing is to go after dopey radio shows and TV and movies and violent video  games and video games, because if it's anything other than that, then you got to look at  yourself, your family, your schools, the churches, and that's crap that you just don't even want  to delve into, you know?  Or God forbid, you got to look in the mirror and point at yourself and go, I raised an animal  or a monster.  No, it's easier to blame it on Opie and Anthony and TV and movies.  I got to go right to Andrew, because, yes, you did ask us about this. 
[00:05:00]  Andrew, what's up?  I want to know if Anthony got any good pedophilia quotes in.  Yeah.  Right off the bat, Bill O'Reilly's thoughts about Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.  Nice.  He goes, you're talking about pre-teen or, uh, uh, girls in their 14, 15 were like, no.  Taking showers together.  Oh, because, no.  Oh, when we say teens, we mean, oh, the Olsen twins, like, oh, yeah, those, those two.  Those two.  Oh, I put my tap shoes on.  I was dancing around all that stuff. 
[00:05:30]  I don't know if we made it out of that question alive.  Oh, I think we did fine with that one.  We did?  Yeah, it was entertainment value.  I go, what we're saying about them isn't that we're going out and, again, uh, oh, my  God, we got to grab, uh, teen girls off of AOL and take them to our houses in, uh, Long  Island.  Oh, wait, no, that did happen.  Awful.  Awful.  They will dump out of that, you idiot.  Why?  Just say excited.  They don't like that word.  They don't like that reason.  That's right.  Kids might hear it.  Kids.  The kids might hear it. 
[00:06:00]  Private party.  But O'Reilly's like, you were reading a, uh, uh, news story about the Olsen twins taking  a shower together and said, showering.  Taking your stuff out.  I go, there's an article we read.  I go, these girls have been on TV since they were babies and, uh, all of a sudden they're starting  to sprout right before our eyes.  I go, of course we're going to look down the road now and say, well, what's the  wow?  By the time they hit 18, they're going to be hot.  Right.  They'll open it.  That's, that's just opening your eyes.  So I think we kind of skirted that issue.  I didn't tell them I would bang them right now at 15. 
[00:06:30]  And wouldn't have for seven years.  But I'm sure they're taping the show today.  So they'll just see, I've been vindicated.  I told you, listen to this audio clip that we pulled from the show after the interview  with me, Bill O'Reilly.  Bill O'Reilly.  The O'Reilly factor.  He's a cool guy.  He seemed all right.  He's really like completely out of the realm of anything I know.  But he's just all business broadcaster.  I mean, the guy is a professional.  Didn't even crack a smile. 
[00:07:00]  No.  Because we're laughing and we're trying to have some fun with the damn thing.  I tell you what, that guy's going to go far though.  I see him like, you know, the next Larry King.  Maybe take over for Tom Brokaw when he leaves NBC.  At one point I'm sitting there and I think to myself, oh my God, that's, wow, that's  Bill O'Reilly right there.  Bill O'Reilly.  And there's no like, he's not in a TV, he's live and he's talking to us.  And we sound stupid.  What show did he used to do? 
[00:07:30]  I wouldn't recognize him if he teabagged me.  Yeah, well, thank God we wouldn't either.  Dan from Hoboken.  Did Psycho Mark put on your mics for Bill O'Reilly or did he move on to mixing Crystal  Light for Paula Zahn?  Hey, you shut up.  That's funny, mixing Crystal Light.  We walk up to the Fox building and the first person we see is Psycho Mark outside.  I was just taking some time away from my job.  I needed some fresh air. 
[00:08:00]  How are you doing now?  Welcome to my world, he says.  Right.  He was waiting outside the building.  We come walking up.  Kek, kek, kek.  Welcome to Fox.  Go Fox yourself.  I wasn't waiting for you or anything.  I just needed a break.  Fox, where are you going?  So, well, we'll see what happens.  It was a no-win situation.  I don't even know why we did that.  It was all right.  I never did one of those type of news shows like that, you know, where the guy actually,  it's not just us trying to be goofy, you know? 
[00:08:30]  Right.  Sean, what's up?  This is John.  Hey, Anthony did so much tap dancing around that question, he made Bojangles look like  a club foot.  Yeah.  Very nice.  You guys suck.  Bill O'Reilly.  No, the Olsen twins.  Oh, no.  And then the drug question.  Do you talk about drugs on your program?  Like, yeah.  Talk about drugs, you know?  That's what's happening.  What do you say about drugs? 
[00:09:00]  Bad drugs are good.  What do you think we say?  You know, we talk about it.  We go, it's funny.  I said, it's really funny when somebody who's really stoned calls up and we talk to him  on the phone.  And he just is staring at me with this blank look.  I go, come on, right, Bill?  It's funny.  I go, potheads are funny, right?  Oh, they're funny.  And he's just like, no.  He's just kind of looking.  Come on, Bill.  It's funny.  Lab.  That was the only law in the interview when I was trying to think of an answer.  I'm like, I don't know, Bill. 
[00:09:30]  What do you say about drugs?  We say we don't.  I'll tell you one thing, we say we don't do them anymore.  And we talk about how we used to really screw up while we were doing them.  Oh, brother.  Pretty funny, though, being on that whole, I mean, it's opposite ends of the spectrum.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  He can't understand our world and we certainly can't understand his.  No.  But he was cool.  We'll see how cool it is after it gets out of the editing room. 
[00:10:00]  I don't care.  I know we were honest and we answered the questions and we weren't hiding anything.  It was fun.  I thought it was pretty cool.  And we'll see what happens.  Sonny, what's up?  Hey, ONA.  What's going on?  What's the agony?  Yeah, I live in Maryland.  I'm starting to listen to you.  I wanted to know.  I've got a couple things.  Did you see Jackass Sunday?  We all checked it out in the office before the show.  Bro, Jackass, by the way, canceled.  They pretty much pulled themselves.  Did they really?  Yeah.  Yeah, they said they're done.  Johnny Knoxville said, you know, that's it.  I'm done with this.  He's moving on to movies and wants to go out on top. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, I'm surprised he's not paralyzed by now.  Yeah, that's probably why.  Well, it looks like the article we read in the New York Papers that it looked like MTV  was putting some pressure on Johnny Knoxville and the gang to tone it down.  And they just said, you know what?  Let's just leave on top.  Yeah, he also said that they're going to rerun.  Hey, ONA.  Hey, hold on.  Hold on.  Sorry.  He said they're going to rerun.  MTV's going to rerun the episodes they already have.  But he said they're going to cut out some questionable material.  And he goes, that means the funny stuff.  So it's just going to be a, well, bravo to those guys for, you know, backing out now 
[00:11:00]  instead of, you know, dealing with a watered-down jacket.  Hey, guys.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I got another thing to say.  You know that Chrissy Pix that called you the other day?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I got something to say to her.  I want to tell her that I hope she goes out and she commits a crime and they send her  to jail and she has to share her cell with a big, fat, mullet-haired dyke with tattoos  all over her.  And she shoves a toilet brush up her split-faced hair shark and then shoves it in a balloon  knob.  And it's so big, you can park a car in there. 
[00:11:30]  You hear me?  I know you're listening.  I live in Maryland.  I love you guys.  I'm listening every day.  You rock.  Thank you, Sonny.  It's a little too long to be a bumper sticker, but I like it.  MTV's losing their minds, though, because they're toning down the jackass or obviously,  you know, it's gone now.  Yeah, but the reruns will all be toned down.  And you know that song, I Get High?  Yeah.  By Apro Man?  Yeah.  They refuse to play the video on MTV.  Well, the drugs.  The drugs, Opie.  You know how impressionable?  Don't you know how impressionable those children are?  What if a 12-year-old child that's left unattended is playing with matches and dynamite and starts 
[00:12:00]  listening to your show and you say something like Light the Fuse?  Well, Bill.  I was calling him Bill, too.  I was just like, well, Bill.  You know, Bill.  Like I know the guy.  You should have called him.  I was like, Bill, you know Bill.  He goes, why?  Why?  Why with the lesbians and the sex?  No, I don't.  Bill, come on. 
[00:12:30]  I said it.  I go, hey, man.  Guys love lesbians.  Right, Bill?  Bill, you ever hang out with your friends?  You're walking down the street.  You see a girl, especially in nice weather, wearing the little top and the nice shirt.  You don't turn around and go, that's nice.  No.  He didn't say that, but I saw him thinking it.  You're not thinking what her IQ scores are.  Right.  All right.  How is your show responsible for world hunger?  Well, I don't think it is. 
[00:13:00]  I think parents should do parenting.  Yeah.  That old gang.  He didn't like that.  He rolled his eyes.  I'm like, well, my parents parented me.  Would you hold back anything on the air?  No.  Screw it.  Who cares?  So you would do anything for money and ratings?  For ratings and dirty money.  By the way, my contract's up.  And I call my agent.  I want more money.  Like he's doing a public service announcement over there every night.  No.  He's getting paid nice dime.  He mentioned money so many times.  At one point, I turn to Anthony.  I go, oh, the money thing again. 
[00:13:30]  The money thing.  Now, since what you do is material and it turns into ratings and ratings turns into money,  you're whores.  He didn't say that either.  Money.  Money.  Dirty, filthy money.  I need a new almighty suit.  You have no problem taking all that dirty money from the company.  How much is in your wallet right now?  You boys are now millionaires, aren't you?  You sure don't dress like a millionaire.  You know, I got my lousy shirt on and my pants. 
[00:14:00]  Like, I don't know, but I'll show you my checkbook, Bill.  Right.  I sure ain't a millionaire.  Uncle Jed's a millionaire.  I ain't no millionaire.  Carolyn.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Or is it Caroline, Brian?  Caroline, Brian.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  That's you again.  What's up, Caroline?  Well, a couple of things.  First of all, if you go to E! Online and you go to the Fashion Police,  they have, you know, different people coming to premieres.  And there is a thing about the Olsen twins.  There's a picture of them.  And the little caption is sort of leaning towards maybe something not too appropriate, 
[00:14:30]  especially for, you know, somebody like the E! website.  Yeah.  You might want to check that out.  Okay.  But the other thing that I wanted to say is that you were talking about, you know,  not being daycare center friendly on your show,  but everybody seems to be eating the ham on white bread  and having little grapes and Ziploc bags there,  according to the New York Magazine article.  All right.  So you got the little snacks going.  All right.  I know what you're getting at.  We'll talk about it after break. 
[00:15:00]  How's that?  Can you stick around or call us back?  Call us back, okay?  Okay.  All right.  She's obviously referring to our latest interview in New York Magazine.  Oh, boy.  It's out on newsstands today, the August 20th edition of New York Magazine.  You can get this in every city, by the way,  so don't think just because it's New York Magazine you can't get it.  Wrong.  Yeah, big article on you and I, and we could go over the article next.  It's pretty funny.  But this guy picked up on a lot of little things.  Yeah.  He noticed what I was eating while he was interviewing us. 
[00:15:30]  I'm surprised the time interview didn't notice what you were eating,  since he was enamored with you.  So why don't we talk about the New York Magazine interview next?  All right.  There's some funny things in here.  All right.  And by the way, the jackass that was on the last one,  I think that's what the guy was getting at.  If you see it in reruns, it's probably the best jackass they've put out yet.  Brad Pitt, at the beginning, being abducted is hysterical.  It's Brad Pitt.  And they put him on a line of something. 
[00:16:00]  It looked like a movie line or something.  Movie theater or something, right?  And the van pulls up with Johnny Knoxville and all the other guys in it,  and they're going, hey, Brad Pitt, Brad Pitt.  So now everyone's looking, going, oh, my God, it is Brad Pitt.  They jump out of the van, grab Brad Pitt,  who starts his best fight club fighting, trying to get away,  and scream at him, help me, help me.  They throw him in the van and speed off Ty is squealing.  They got people on the cell phone going,  yo, Brad Pitt has just been kidnapped. 
[00:16:30]  I'm not kidding.  I'm not kidding, right?  Brad Pitt was standing on line and was just thrown into a van.  Was he in on it, Brad Pitt, at least?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  But I'm like, I'm telling Anthony in the back office,  he's crazy to do that bit.  Because now, like, he's going to be walking around L.A.  and people are going to go, hey, he did it on jackass.  Let's kidnap Brad Pitt.  Let's bring him back to our place and smoke some duves with Brad.  Don't mention drugs.  Oh, yeah.  Here's the Olsen twins thing on E.  Wow.  At first, it's Twin Peaks is the headline. 
[00:17:00]  Wow.  Where does the time go?  Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen look all grown up at the ABC Summer Press Tour All-Star Party.  With their long straight locks, sexy silk halters, and hipster slacks,  this dynamic duo is going to break some Hollywood hearts before they even hit Sweet 16.  See?  It's not just me.  They're using the word sexy.  Sexy.  Anthony, that's wrong, Anthony.  Dynamic duo.  Hoo-hoo. 
[00:17:30]  All right.  One more call before we take a break.  Gary, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  You guys see Raw last night with Stephanie McMahon and her breast implants?  Holy ass.  Another thing we got to talk about after the break.  Yes, I did see.  Oh, my God.  They're humongous.  They're huge.  It was so funny with the bit that Chris Jericho and The Rock did.  I was on the floor.  Yeah, we'll get into it next.  We're trying to get someone from the WWF on the show today to admit that Stephanie has these huge breast implants.  Well, after last night, there is no doubt in my mind anymore because now they're all starting to make fun of her breast implants on the show. 
[00:18:00]  All right, Gary.  Thank you.  I love you.  Cool.  Quick break, Anthony.  Yes.  If you're not in New York, give us a call, 866-277-4WOW.  Yeah, we'll talk about the New York Magazine interview next, okay?  I know.  We got to talk about Earl getting told over and Kimmy from Survivor.  That's a lie.  Coming in today.  Go F yourself.  Earl throwing a hissy fit in the office because we were telling the truth. 
[00:18:30]  He was lying and he was pissed.  Too much to do today.  Jay Moore going to stop in and say hi.  Cool, man.  So, lots to do today.  Opie Anthony.  Join ONA at Hooters on 56th between Broadway and 7th Avenue this Thursday after the show.  Bring down any one of ONA's recent magazine articles.  Rolling Stone, Time, FHM, New York Magazine.

That don't mean I go set the garage on fire to see if he can put it up.  Exactly right.  Get the home.  Daddy, I decided I don't want to be a firefighter anymore.  Explain that one to your wife.  I burned the garage down because Ollie said he wanted to be a fireman.  Now we're going to see if he wants to be an insurance claim to adjuster.  Sports guys, Blaine and Craig.

[00:20:30]  We've got to go right to the phones.  Jesus.  Let's see what Mike has.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Opie, I just wanted to know, did Sandy pack up your lunch today?  I'm going fast.  Pack your lunch.  Don't you make $10,000 a year?  Can you buy your own lunch?  You cheap bastard.  Thank you, Mike.  Are you munching on grape?  All right, all right.  He's munching on grape.  He's referring to me.  I haven't been through this article yet.  I've got to get to that.  The article is hilarious. 
[00:21:00]  He's talking about the New York Magazine article on us that came out today.  The August 20th edition of New York Magazine on newsstands now.  Rich, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I've got a question for Anthony.  Where'd you like find a fountain of youth or something?  I mean, a Time article said you were 39, and this article said you're 38.  Yeah, I know.  I keep losing years.  And another thing.  How do you like to be compared to a vibrator?  I haven't gotten to that point yet.  That part's funny, too.  Goddamn.  Thank you, Rich.  All right, guys.  All right, we should go through this article, man. 
[00:21:30]  There's a lot of great little things in here.  Man, every article that comes out on us, they just have a completely different spin of what the show's about.  One of these days, one of these guys will get it perfectly.  You know?  Oh, geez.  I vibrate.  Okay.  Yeah, they say you switch and stuff.  Vibrate when he's not doing anything.  Oh, God.  Yeah, okay.  I, like, loosen up when I'm sitting here. 
[00:22:00]  And I do believe when he was in, what was I doing?  I think I was doing the guy, the shop-at-home guy.  Yeah, down west?  And after that, yeah, my neck hurts.  So you started, like, twitching and stuff?  Oh, well.  You know, that's why we hate having these guys watching us.  Because they watch everything.  Because it's the smallest thing.  I'm not twitching like Norton, but, you know, maybe I want to go through some of this or what?  My shoulders.  This is New York Magazine, August 20th.  It's on newsstands now. 
[00:22:30]  Headline, gross profits.  Lesbian catfighters.  Blind boxers.  Aging strippers.  Aging.  These are a few of radio hosts Opie and Anthony's favorite things.  Now, now they've helped the duo win an estimated $30 million contract to go national.  Goddamn John Minnelli from the Post with that figure.  It's wrong.  Very wrong.  We're doing well now, but not $30 million well.  Shut up, Rick. 
[00:23:00]  There's some funny stuff in here.  Don't make enough money that someone else can't pack Opie's lunch.  It's packed your lunch.  I got to see that part.  I have an explanation for that, Anthony.  All right.  All right.  So the article starts off.  What's going on with the amputee girl?  Anthony Kumiya demands during a break in the Opie and Anthony show.  But neither partner Greg Opie Hughes nor producer Ben Sparks nor any of the handful of 20-something interns  and assistants has an idea of what's happened to the woman who promised to come in and show off her prosthetic foot.  The last time I spoke to her, she was leaving work offers a producer the guys call Stinky. 
[00:23:30]  Stinky.  Stinky rules.  Stinky.  You're now a producer.  Stinky.  Thank you very much.  Stinky producer of the Opie and Anthony show.  Ying Yang party, baby.  Ying Yang party.  That's too funny.  Kumiya sips a bottle of Budweiser and shakes his head wearily.  Must have been a Bud spot. 
[00:24:00]  As he and Hughes face each other across the width of a peninsula-shaped console of switches and dials,  at the end of which someone's carved, I love Anthony.  Producers run in and out of the craft studio waving notes in front of their faces.  There's a half hour left on today's show.  They've already played bingo with collars bra sizes,  and one of the contestants for the planned blind boxing bout has canceled.  Damn it.  Facing the threat of some outrage-free airtime, 
[00:24:30]  Kumiya and Hughes grudgingly allow a Time Ravage stripper named Sandy Kane into the studio.  Time Ravage?  That sounds like something from a science fiction.  This crap is funny, man.  Time Ravage stripper named Sandy Kane into their studio to perform a raunchy ballad.  What the heck is that?  I was looking for this.  Are you ready?  Oh, okay.  Oh, ah.  Ow.  They're forced to bleep out several forbidden phrases, and Hughes warns,  we're going to let you try it one more time, but if we have to dump out again, 
[00:25:00]  we're all going to throw stuff at you.  They replayed this segment yesterday when we were taking the day off.  Yeah.  When she makes it through the number, a twisted love song for Jerry Seinfeld,  Hughes shrugs, let's throw stuff at her anyway.  We're just idiots all the time.  Kane freezes before the mics as all five guys in the studio begin hurling audio cassettes,  half-filled bottles of water, and my favorite,  and copies of Blacktail magazine at the wall just past her head. 
[00:25:30]  Sparks is frantically picking up after his bosses as an overstimulated Hughes  lifts his office chair over his head and smashes it to the floor.  We're a bunch of monkeys in here.  That's funny.  They nailed Ben, though, because Ben always is like,  oh, my God, oh, my God, and pulling up after us.  Red face and sweaty with ten minutes to go.  We're just a mess.  Hughes and Kumia are about to resort to the day's second game of broad bingo 
[00:26:00]  when in walks Emma, a lift, a 20-year-old in a T-shirt, cargo pants,  and Adidas shell toes.  Hey, Emma, you're hot.  Emma snaps off her leg below the knee, removes the sneaker and sock,  and places it on the console.  Hey, it's like a real leg, says Kumia, only it's not.  What bit of genius is that?  Only it's not.  It's like a real leg, only not.  Only not.  That's what I'm trying to say, really.  The guys gaze at the limb with childlike awe. 
[00:26:30]  You said there were fake toes and stuff, Kumia explains.  Complains.  Complains, I'm sorry.  Yeah, I was complaining.  Complaining because it didn't have the fake toes.  She said it was like a real foot.  That's my spare, Emma says.  The foot flew off the other one.  It was pretty funny until I realized I couldn't walk.  Then she tells him that the car accident that cost her the lower part of a leg  also left her clinically dead for several minutes.  Was there a tunnel and light and all that, Kumia asks?  If there was, I don't remember because they gave me so much morphine.  What kind of death is that, Kumia says, laughing. 
[00:27:00]  You got gypped.  Well, if you're going to die for a few minutes, you might as well get the whole treatment.  I think we're doing a show for third graders.  Just the words you're using, gypped and toes and stuff.  You know something?  When we're doing it here, it's one thing.  And then you read it.  As it happens, I'm laughing like I never did this.  Right.  Like it's just something I'm reading.  Giggling, Emma tells them she wanted to come in and show them that she's very all right with it.  I think it's hilarious.  Hughes and Kumia couldn't agree more. 
[00:27:30]  Invite her to come back on the show another day when there's more time.  I just love you guys.  She coos.  Some people will say it's terrible, but you know what?  Hughes says earnestly.  Earnestly?  Did you say this earnestly?  Turn page.  Earnestly off the air.  One-legged people have a sense of humor.  Blind people want to have fun.  We're just trying to have fun and include everyone.  They want to be involved, says Kumia.  Another brilliant quote by myself.  They want to be involved.  Just tell the truth.  It's fun to exploit them.  If you think about it. 
[00:28:00]  If you think about it, really.  Those getting involved include busty catfighters, a ventriloquist whose dummy can't stop shrieking,  burn your meat curtains with a crack pipe.  Burn your meat curtains with a crack pipe, you whore.  Get in the coffin, die.  And actor Jay Moore, who offers ribald impressions and a target for jokes about his career woes.  Popular running gags include Whipping Mount Wednesday, when Opie and Anthony encouraged  female fans to expose their breasts to cars with wild bumper stickers.  F.U. Friday, when callers ran about everything from traffic to cheating wives. 
[00:28:30]  And Cripple Bouts, a series of fights between physically challenged listeners held right  inside the studio.  The name of the latter was changed from Battle Crips after the show received calls from  people claiming to be upset gang members.  That is true.  We did chicken out on that one.  In between stunts, they ponder possible double entendres and Judas Priest lyrics now that former  frontman Rob Halford has come out as gay and howl at a recording of Chris Burke, the actor  with Down Syndrome, who played Corky and Life Goes On, singing a Beatles song. 
[00:29:00]  If it makes people uneasy to hear someone with Down Syndrome sing, it makes them laugh when  others are willing to join in.  Hughes and Kumia call it cringe radio.  There you go.  Cringe radio.  What's this cringe radio?  Yeah, Bill O'Reilly.  Bill O'Reilly, cringe radio.  If you were a better person, you wouldn't laugh, but you're not.  And anyway, where's the beer?  Another quote from us, Anthony.  And it goes on and on.  And you want to read a little bit of this from two critics?  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah, the critics, the Opie and Anthony show is a cultural nightmare of sexism, racism and 
[00:29:30]  homophobia, complete with frequent use of the word fag.  It's called dark humor, says Kumia.  We're human beings and sometimes we find things that are wrong funny.  Sometimes we find tragedy funny and that's the way we've always been.  We haven't advanced to the point where we're Vulcans.  Hughes and Kumia.  Word fag is used.  Fag.  Are used to explaining it themselves since they've had a lot of laughter on the show.  Since a lot of the laughter on the show is thick with meanness that can surface when 
[00:30:00]  working class white guys fed up with political correctness get together to blow off steam.  Though Kumia says it's not done out of hatred.  See, that's wrong.  It is.  It is.  It's done out of hatred.  Their free for all rap sessions invite callers to indulge their basest, nastiest impulses  after playing a taped F.U. call on the air.  Hughes decides to call this rant, which compares summer school students to monkeys climbing  around on buses, crosses the line and orders a producer to tone it down for future use. 
[00:30:30]  Really?  Which producer did you tell that to?  Was it Stinky?  Was it producer Stinky?  Yeah, I did say.  I did tell Stinky.  See, right, Stink?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You were all pissed.  When talking about women using Kumia, it's weird to see my name, I often warn their audience  to be cool as though they're afraid listeners might cross the line from inappropriate laughing  into inappropriate touching.  When did you give the be cool warning in 1974?  Yo, man, be cool. 
[00:31:00]  Yo, be cool.  To Kumia, it's just regular guys hanging out.  And indeed, much of the show is spent reacting to wisecracks that come in by phone fax and  internet messages that flash on flat panel monitors hanging from the studio ceiling.  Ceiling?  The lesbians and all that, he says, are what we like to call the attention getters.  That's an attention getter.  He doesn't explain this next little thing.  He goes, if there's an adult, if there's an adult on the show, it's Hughes at 36, the 
[00:31:30]  younger of the two, but doesn't explain why he says that.  Kumia, 38, dominates blocks of the program with manic celebrity impressions, Mike Tyson,  Regis, Captain Quinn from Jaws, as Hughes works to control panels and feeds him ideas.  In performance mode, this is funny, Kumia constantly flicks his head around like he's  searching for some invisible object.  His wiry body even seems to vibrate when he's not doing anything at all.  When he's not cackling, Hughes, who still resembles the Ron Howard character from whom he got his 
[00:32:00]  nickname, has two expressions, thoughtful and weary.  Thoughtful and weary.  Thoughtful and weary.  What the F?  Two expressions, thoughtful and weary.  And then it goes on and on.  And I don't know if we should read the whole thing.  Yeah, because now it's business end of it.  Yeah, we really want to hear quotes from people from inside radio and just talking about syndication  deal, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:32:30]  Some Howard stuff, blah, blah, blah.  Kumia and Hughes are average guys who make a point of volunteering just how average they  are.  That is so not true.  Yeah, I know.  You know, a lot of a lot of people think it's very calculated.  Like when we sit there and go, I don't know, we just drive into work and come here, we have  fun and go home.  Wow, they're brilliant the way they hide what they're really doing.  What they're really doing is hanging out, driving home.  No, I take the train and Anne drives.  Yeah.  And it was a nightmare today. 
[00:33:00]  What else?  What else?  The girlfriend stuff.  Oh, the girlfriend stuff?  Here we go.  Both have serious girlfriends.  Hughes for eight years, Kumia for two, neither of whom works.  We have a very normal relationship, says Hughes.  She spends my money.  She has a great life.  Works out.  Makes me dinner.  That's my girlfriend's life.  Jesus Christ.  That's awful.  Kitchen in the bedroom, Florida. 
[00:33:30]  Don't say it, James.  James.  Co-hosting a daily frat party, Ken Hughes admits, create the occasional rift in a relationship.  She gets bothered sometimes when the chicks are in the studio, but that's an important  part of doing a radio show that guys want to check out.  Kumia adds that his girlfriend loves the show.  She finds me funny.  There you go.  That said, neither Hughes nor Kumia lets his girlfriend be interviewed.  We keep them naked and gagged in a closet out on Long Island. 
[00:34:00]  Where's the part about my stupid lunch?  Where's your sandwich?  Right on the next paragraph.  The next paragraph?  Oh, both grew up among the strip malls in 7-Elevens of Long Island.  My mom was pretty strict when I was growing up, so I never really got a chance to experiment  as a teenager, says Hughes, munching on a ham on white sandwich his girlfriend packed  him.  There's also a Ziploc bag full of grapes.  Wow.  He's eating lunch.  Come on.  Ham on white? 
[00:34:30]  No.  How many?  Because I'm getting killed.  I mean, I'm getting killed because of this line in this interview.  How many times do I bring lunch in a week?  Once maybe.  Spends my money.  She has a great life.  Works out.  Makes me dinner.  And puts my sandwiches in a bag for lunch.  A little Ziploc bag full of grapes.  Then it goes into the history of my stupid college career and this and that.  And then what you did.  What else do we want to hit on this?  You talk about how you can go back to construction if I fell on my ass. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  And then it's about the road show.  A lot of that stuff.  All right.  You can read that.  This also bugs me.  We haven't advanced to the point where we're Vulcans.  Could you have had a bigger understatement?  You're not even primates.  You know what?  Some people think we've advanced to this point where off-color humor isn't funny anymore.  They're so high and mighty that they think, you know, we've passed that point. 
[00:35:30]  We're so far beyond that.  I say no.  I say no.  I say no.  Doug from Springfield, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Opie Poo, what color pants did your girlfriend dress you that day?  Yeah.  Did she bake, put some nice chocolate chip cookies and oatmeal cookies?  It's great because they're healthy.  Did she make you some Nestle Quick or strawberry milk?  Oh, I didn't think it was going to be my turn today.  Take it easy, guys.  I don't want to deal with this today.  Do you like another grape?  No, thanks.  I don't want to get fat.  I've had four grapes.  Five is over time. 
[00:36:00]  Tom, what's up?  Hey, Opie, man.  Where are any Twinkies in a little container of milk in a second?  Oh, milky.  Did I say this on stage at the Stone Pony?  Are you ready for some debauchery and drunken stupidity?  Kumia asks to a volley of affirming howls from a crowd of several thousand fans at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park, New Jersey.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  And that talks about us setting up the lesbian pool. 
[00:36:30]  The lesbian pool.  Raisins, anyone?  And then it ends with, that same afternoon, Rob from Cleveland calls in wanting the whole show explained.  You're talking about things that don't even mean anything, he complains.  It's like a soap opera.  Well, soap operas don't make sense the first time you see them, Hugh says.  I think that was your line, but you've got to keep tuning in. 
[00:37:00]  He laughs full of regular guy confidence.  What is that?  Who said that?  Who said, who said, who said?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Regular guy confidence.  We're going to turn Rob around.  The first team party we do, the first lesbian couch thing we do, we're going to win Rob over.  Yeah, where's Rob?  Call up, we know you listen.  Say hi.  There's just some of the article that appears in the latest issue of New York Magazine, the August 20th edition.  Where's my latest edition of Black Tail Magazine over?  That was a funny line, man.  Black Tail. 
[00:37:30]  And this one right here about how you, the girls in the studio, but that's an important part of the show.  You know, that's what the guys want to check out.  Like, you know, you really could care less, but you know, those silly guys like to see breasts and heinies.  Silly.  You'll tolerate it because you're a good fella.  Yeah, because, you know, we're doing it for the listeners.  Yeah.  Of course.  Rich wants to know why Sandy doesn't pack your lunch in an old cement bag.  Wow.  He's really going back to a break of about a year ago.  Very funny.  At least I could buy little, you know, lunch bags. 
[00:38:00]  Little lunch bags now, see?  Kind of neat.  You guys, that's a kind of cool thing that you guys had going on in school.  One for the sandwich and one for the grapes.  Yeah.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, Opie, I bet you can't wait until Halloween so you can go pumpkin picking with Sandy.  You tool.  Pumpkin picking.  How long ago did you go pumpkin picking?  Was it last year?  Yeah.  I think, I thought you skipped last year.  Did I skip last year?  I might have.  I don't even know.  No, I probably didn't, Anthony.  Blue Naut Joe.  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, Opie, was your sandwich a little crunchy from some of that leftover cement mix in your 
[00:38:30]  lunch bag?  That's great.  Willie, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Hey, what the hell kind of name is Kumiya?  It sounds like some spice from the West Indies or something.  That's Kumiya.  No, it's...  Kumiya.  It's Italian.  Italian.  Oh.  What do you think?  I made it up?  I thought so, maybe.  I don't know if you guys want your real names out there.  Ah, they...  Nah, they've been all over in the paper and stuff. 
[00:39:00]  Don't matter.  I haven't seen it yet.  These guys like to think they know something about you that no one else does.  Yeah.  So we're going to do the whole article talking about them using their last name.  Right.  Yeah, they're all friends and everything.  You guys got a great show.  Take care of yourself.  No one suffers.  The rest of the Hughes' on Long Island are like, oh, God.  Well, you know, they didn't mention the whole thing that sometimes that, you know, on a Friday,  if it's been a good week, she'll pack you a little pixie stick for dessert.  A pixie stick.  Thank God.  Or a crispy red apple. 
[00:39:30]  Opie, is that thoughtful or weary, what I'm looking at right now?  Healthy.  Is it thoughtful or weary as you pluck another grape from your Ziploc bag?  If this goes on a little longer, it's going to be weary.  Sometimes he even throws one up and catches it with his hand.  And laughs with regular guy confidence.  Because I'm a regular guy that takes the train in every day.  And I do it for the listeners.  God damn it.  Tony.  Hey, guys.  How you doing? 
[00:40:00]  Hey, man.  Hey, listen.  Does your girlfriend also wrap up your soda in tin foil?  Keeps it cold.  And also, do you smuggle those grapes into the studio?  That's making you a grape smuggler?  Thank you, Tony.  Take care, guys.  You suck.  All right.  Look who's on the phone.  Sandy.  Hi.  Hey.  I just was in the car and I heard them, like, ripping on you.  It's the sandwich maker, Sandy.  It's me.  Who makes me dinner every night.  I know.  Look.  The article makes me look like Susie Holmacher.  Works out. 
[00:40:30]  Makes him dinner.  And spends my money.  And spends his money.  Which is partly what I do, but that's not all I do.  Oh.  Right.  But luckily...  You're working on the cure for AIDS.  We have sex every once in a while, sweets.  Yeah.  That's like something you should throw in there.  I know, right?  Luckily, they didn't notice everything else you had that day.  That was the day you had, like, a full, full lunch.  Yeah.  You had, like, your fruit cup and your...  I didn't have a fruit cup.  Yes, you did.  That was...  Sandy, do you cut the crusts off? 
[00:41:00]  Or cut the sandwich into a heart shape?  Leave a little note.  I love you.  Sandy, cut it in quarters.  What?  We haven't really been able to talk about this at home.  Yeah.  Because it's kind of embarrassing.  Yeah.  Did you really catch me the other night?  Yes, I did.  Oh, my God.  Oh, he talked about it already?  No.  You caught him.  I did catch you, and I had to close my eyes.  Wait a minute.  He was using one of the couch cushion pillows to cover himself, but I could see what was going 
[00:41:30]  on.  Could you please get some...  Because I was on the couch.  Sandy, get some folding chairs so when I come over I have something to sit on, because  I'm not sitting on that couch.  The way our couches are set up, I was on the other couch, so I was looking towards him  and towards the television.  Wait, I don't get this.  You're in the same room.  Yeah.  It opens across from you on the couch.  Oh, you're asleep again.  I woke up.  Now, I remember when this happened previously.  What?  You were doing something.  Sandy wasn't even in the room. 
[00:42:00]  You were sitting on the couch.  He's watching a porno.  Yeah, and I come in, and he throws on NASCAR.  You came in, and he shut it off real quick, but he didn't have the right channel on.  Yeah, he put it on NASCAR, which he never watched.  No, no, it was just that I pushed stop on the porno, and the channel that popped up  was NASCAR.  It was NASCAR, and Sandy knows Opie would never watch NASCAR, so she knew something was up.  But this time, you're asleep across from him on the couch.  Yeah.  We rented a rush hour, Anthony.  Rush hour.  Wait a minute.  What's in rush hour that would get you so randy? 
[00:42:30]  Particularly sexy kick that's thrown.  No, I was bored with the movie.  You were bored with the movie, so you figured you'd just crank one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like a goddamn monkey.  So you're sitting there, and what happened?  Sandy just opened her eyes?  Well, because he couldn't see me, because his back was to me, because our couches are like  at a 90 degree angle.  Oh, so you're laying on your side, and you're facing, no, I'm talking to Opie, he's laying 
[00:43:00]  on his side, you're facing the back.  Her head's like, I'll show you.  No, he's on his back.  Here's a TV over here, I'm laying down like this, and her head's like over here on the  other couch.  Oh, I got you, okay.  So you're on your back.  He's on his back.  So I take a look behind me, I'm like, hey, she's asleep.  Where were you going to put it?  What did you have?  Did you have a Ziploc baggie on it?  The empty bag from his grave.  Oh, it's all gooey.  What were you going to do with it?  I just, you know, I just...  Just let it fly? 
[00:43:30]  Shoot some web.  And then get...  Oh, my God.  So put it this way, I wake up, I open my eyes, and I see his hand going.  I just closed my eyes to pretend I was still sleeping.  I just wake up, and his hand is gone.  Holy Jesus.  What'd you do?  Me?  Yeah.  She got scared.  I closed my eyes, and I just, like, closed my eyes, pretending I was sleeping.  And I would, like, open them to check, and he was still doing it, and then I said, forget, 
[00:44:00]  I'll just close my eyes and just go back to sleep.  What a dysfunctional relationship this is.  Was he making any noises?  No.  Oh, no.  You didn't hear any?  No, I got embarrassed, because I obviously didn't expect me to see, and I opened my eyes,  so I had to pretend like I didn't see what was going on.  Oh, my God.  But I mentioned it to him the other day.  I said, I forgot what we were talking about.  I'm like, well, I saw you playing around the other night.  Playing around, like he's with Legos.  Oh, that's so funny.  I'm like, oh, you saw that?  And then we dropped it. 
[00:44:30]  Sounds good.  Yes, we never got back to it.  Sounds good.  We bring it up for 12 cities.  Good.  Good.  Yes.  So, I don't understand.  Wouldn't that normally set something off where you'd be having sex in a matter of minutes?  Yeah.  I would think.  Yeah, I guess, but it was just one of those.  It scared Sandy, though.  Well, because I woke up, and that's all I saw.  Well, you just saw, like, the...  I saw the hand going.  I thought you just saw the pillow.  No, because he had the pillow on his plan.  He was banging a pillow.  No, I wasn't. 
[00:45:00]  No, he was not.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  No, he was not.  Shut up, Rick.  Stick to the facts.  Oh, I can't say that?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Was there a block of melted cheese on the couch?  The pillow was strategically set to my side, so she couldn't see what was going.  Exactly.  It worked really well.  But I could see the hand going.  The hand.  Oh, you are the greatest.  The hand is going.  She closes her eyes, and he covers with a pillow.  This is so great.  Oh, man.  I'm just eating grapes. 
[00:45:30]  Man, I looked back a couple times.  I did not see you wake up.  I'll make your sandwich, but I see I won't have to use any mayonnaise.  Supplying that yourself, are you?  All right.  Well, thanks, Sam.  Well, you brought that one up.  I wasn't going to mention that.  Wow.  I figured if I'm in the barrel, I might as well go the whole distance.  Shut up.  Mel, they've got something else to rip you on besides your little sandwich.  What?  Oh, that?  Yeah.  Crank him.  Okay.  Thanks, Sam.  All right.  Well, have a good day. 
[00:46:00]  Crank him.  Bye.  Bye.  That's so great she called with that.  That's the third time, too.  Third time.  Oh, yeah.  Third time?  Third time.  She just keeps catching you, huh?  I think he wants to get caught.  Yeah.  Now it's sounding like one of those things where, all right, he kind of wants to get caught now.  To cry for help.  Yeah.  Yeah, just whatever.  All right.  Do we have to announce that?  Yeah.  Black Girl in the Wild Van at Kmart, 300 Baychester Avenue in the Bronx for a Lipton sticker stop. 
[00:46:30]  Lipton sticker stop.  He's giving out a lot of stickers, right?  Yeah.  Well, it's sponsored by Lipton.  Sponsored by Lipton.  Van arrives at four, and we got a lot of things to ask Earl.  To ask Earl.  Also, quickly, we were talking about Asbury Park and the road show.  Our friend Dickie Betts back in the news real quick.  A former Allman Brothers band leader, guitarist, band lead guitarist and songwriter Dickie Betts  been charged with domestic battery, accused of punching his wife in the face while she was driving.  Betts released from jail on $2,000 bail. 
[00:47:00]  He had also been arrested for a domestic battery in January.  And at the road show, who was there?  Dickie Betts.  He was up on stage for a while.  Played a couple of tunes with the nerds.  Went backstage, I guess, with his wife.  We saw security details shortly after that.  Running for the door.  Headed toward Dickie Betts and his wife.  Turns out Dickie was popping his wife in the face.  Why did he hit her? 
[00:47:30]  Did she forget to pack his grapes?  She caught him.  So there it is.  Scotty.  Yeah.  Hey.  What's going on?  What's up?  Nah.  You can't believe that?  Nah, man.  What are you doing?  I don't understand what you're doing with this girl right there.  You got to use the, what are we going to do about this?  No, she was out cold and I was too lazy to move to the other room.  I'm just like, screw it.  I'm going to, you know.  Like if she saw the right move for a girl, as you know, you get up and help out.  Give a helping hand. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, man.  Your girl's right there.  That's some embarrassing stuff right there.  She woke up out of a sound sleep to see that.  So she wasn't really prepared for what she was going to say.  Good thing it wasn't a load right in the eye.  Easy.  Dan from Hoboken's checking in.  He goes, wow.  Sandy took the time out of her busy workout and cooking schedule to call the show.  Hey, Lewis.  Dude, you guys kill me, man.  It's amazing that you have the success that you have.  I mean, Opie's whacking it like a whack-a-mole. 
[00:48:30]  Anthony's shaking like a crack junkie.  And Sandy's sitting in bed over there like the house is being robbed with her eyes closed, hoping that he don't catch her.  All right, Lewis.  Thank you.  Talk to you later.  Bye.  All right.  We have to take a break.  Yeah, please.  Woo!  Take a break.  God, that Lewis just gets me laughing so hard with his comedy that I need a breather now with commercials.  Did one of the interns bring us some Danning yogurt?  I didn't take his calls. 
[00:49:00]  Shut up, man.  Doochback.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Opie, I thought you liked the Mets, not the Yankees.  Hey, Opie.  I get it, the Yankees.  Did you get tired after your lunch and take a little Natsuki?  A Natsuki.  Lay a little Matt down in the studio.  Oh.  All right.  The abuse is just over the top.  Well, what did you expect?  Anyway, so New York Magazine, Anthony, the August 20th edition.  We're in that. 
[00:49:30]  It's all.  Oh, geez.  Anyways, that's what the...  All right.  I'll just shut my eyes.  What are the looks?  Thoughtful, caught, and what else?  Weary.  Weary.  Now you know why I'm so weary.  George.  Anthony, Opie.  Yeah.  Hey, man.  What's happening, guys?  Hey. 
[00:50:00]  Listen, I just got a question.  When Sandy changes the sheep, is it like taking a hard top off a convertible?  Thank you, George.  They bend them up and sell them as wicker furniture.  Hey, one last...  Guys, one last thing.  Yeah.  Are you going to start the regular guy look like Rodney Dangerfield did?  Hey.  Hey.  Easy money.  Nice.  You got to get the regular guy tire going.  They can't believe that we're, you know, we're still doing the same stuff we were doing  four years ago.  They're just amazed that our lives haven't changed.  Yeah.  We're doing a syndicated radio show now. 
[00:50:30]  I was having fun beforehand.  Why wouldn't I do the same things I was having fun doing?  And they keep trying to trick us and stuff like, you know, they openly admit and...  You know what I mean?  I can go into, um...  I could go into bars now because I could pay my bar tab.  That's pretty good because usually you'll have to find a new bar until you got paid the  next week and pay off your tab.  Hey.  Hey, Opie, Dr. Buster Hyman, uh, Opie, with a $30 million contract, can't you afford a  porno J.O. room?

[00:52:30]  All owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNEW.  New York.  We've got to get Tantric on the show, man.  Lead singers from Boston.  Yeah.  If you're in the New York area, give us a call.  877-692-1027.  What are you laughing at now?  What? 
[00:53:00]  What, this one?  There's millions of them on hold.  Chris, what's up?  Yo, I just want to know if you wanted to trade your fruit cup for my pudding.  You want to trade?  Do you have any hot chocolate?  The powder in the little plastic bag?  Remember that?  And then you would just dangle it in front of people.  Who wants the empty bag?  Look, homie, when everyone was trading dessert in school, I had nothing to trade.  We were so poor, I told you.  I had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, usually the end piece of the Wonder Bread. 
[00:53:30]  It wasn't even Wonder Bread.  Know what it was?  What?  This was my lunch.  My brothers are going to start laughing.  I hope they call.  My mom would go to Pepperidge Farm.  Remember Pepperidge Farm bread?  And they would sell, like, day-old bread or something.  And the worst bread.  It was that smaller, thin-sliced bread.  I don't want this.  I want big bread.  How thin?  Well, if you fouled it, how thin was...  It was...  Yeah, it was as thin as that.  It was spinal tap bread.  Seriously, how thin is Pepperidge Farm bread? 
[00:54:00]  It's very thin.  I know, but what would you say?  Like a...  Quarter inch.  Less than a quarter inch.  Less than a quarter inch.  About a quarter inch.  Gee, Mom, you think you could throw me a bone and, you know, give me two or three sandwiches?  It equals one.  It's a catastrophe, but I'm a professional.  I'll rise above this.  So I would have peanut butter and jelly on Pepperidge Farm bread, Anthony.  The bread was so thin, the jelly would leak right through the damn thing, right?  And a bruised apple.  That was my lunch.  Wow.  While everyone else is trading, like, you know, chocolate pudding for this dessert.  And I had nothing to trade.  You have an apple that looks like... 
[00:54:30]  Hold on.  Why are you changing...  Hold on.  Why are you changing mics on me here, Jim?  Oh, I don't know.  Rick was sitting there.  Oh, no one heard what you just said.  That's okay.  It was an AIDS reference.  I couldn't trade dessert.  Rick, stop.  You were like the poor kid.  I was.  It's horrible.  I was very poor.  And then you were talking...  We did a live read for New York, and you were talking about, you know, it's back to school time.  And you were talking about what? 
[00:55:00]  Like, when we were growing up, we had briefcases or something?  It was a school bag.  I didn't have none of that crap.  Like, I would every year, my mother would take us to the store and buy us, like, dress shirts and slacks.  You've got to get the slacks and the shoes.  And then we'd have these...  Me and my brother, like the friggin' Bobsy twins, we'd have these school bag.  It was a briefcase.  You've got, like, a bag that you had a little combination lock. 
[00:55:30]  I don't want anyone to go to my important IBM secret files.  You were rich growing up.  I had none of that.  No, it was not rich.  I had...  We got one pair of corduroys.  We got our one pair of sneakers that had to last the entire year.  Whoa.  That's rough.  And one haircut.  One haircut.  One haircut the whole year?  I got one haircut a year.  So I went from, no joke either, because my mom would get us all to the barbershop.  Just take it right down.  Right down.  Not even a crew cut.  Just all the way off. 
[00:56:00]  And then by the time we needed another haircut, you know, the end of the school year, it was down to my shoulders.  No book bag.  None of that crap.  Did you have cute little folders to put over your textbooks?  I had...  Like Star Trek, you know, folders or...  Yeah.  Or book covers or Scooby-Doo or the Brady Bunch.  No, some of them we'd have to cover in the brown paper bag.  You know, you learn how to make the book cover out of that.  My books were covered with wall bombs.  Shopping bags.  But you'd also get, like, we would get the ruler case. 
[00:56:30]  You know, the little pencil case with the ruler that slid.  And your big dopey eraser that ripped the paper.  All the useless stuff that I would lose because I could care less about being there.  A trapper keeper.  A trapper keeper.  And then the big loose leaf folder and organizer.  You'd get the big organizer.  No.  No?  No, nothing.  I would just figure out whose hand I could stick in the big rings of the loose leaf and slam it shut. 
[00:57:00]  Come here.  I'll give you a buck if you could grab this M&M.  But you're talking about...  You're talking about briefcase and stuff.  No.  No?  I just had to carry my...  See, that's why the first day of school smelt like that, Opie.  Everyone was coming in with that briefcase thing.  Smelt like a slaughterhouse.  You had all the leather.  Well, things have certainly changed in syndication, huh?  No more cement bags.  It's all fresh haircuts, sippy juices, and fruit roll-ups.  Courtesy of Sandy.  Hey, I...  While we're on the subject of school... 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  Tell everyone what would happen to you on the school bus.  We haven't brought this up in about a year.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that was a while ago.  And you know something?  I don't even care about this because I've gotten sympathy.  I've gotten some people that have called up and said this happened, too.  Hell, I just admitted something 20 minutes ago, so...  This was anywhere between, I would say, fourth grade all the way up to maybe seventh grade.  I'd get on the school bus to go to school. 
[00:58:00]  I'd sit down.  And as the bus starts going, I would get wood.  I'd get wood.  It didn't matter.  It wasn't anyone on the bus.  It wasn't anything I was doing.  For some reason, I would sit on the bus.  It wasn't the vibration of the bus.  I don't know what it was.  Was it the football captain you were sitting there?  That must have been it.  It had nothing to do with anything.  I didn't know what it was.  And I would just sit there.  I'd have to put my books in my lap and sit there. 
[00:58:30]  But you'd give an occasional push.  Wait, but how old were you?  I said anywhere between fourth grade and seventh grade.  Yeah, I was reading something on the screen, so I didn't hear that all in there.  But you noticed it happened on the school bus all the time.  It wasn't every day on the school bus.  It just wasn't the random...  No.  No, I'd get like...  First, you'd get your morning wood, which would be right when you wake up.  You are an ass.  Oh, jeez. 
[00:59:00]  I don't want to get the H, fellas.  Yeah.  I would, uh...  I'd get the morning wood, and then that would go away.  Well, you got the random wood all day long.  The random wood can just come out of nowhere, especially at that age.  But I would get on the bus, I'd sit down, and it would just happen.  It looks like you're just supposed to roll it over your wiener.  I had the same thing happen on a school bus when I was driving.  Yeah, and if the driver gets it, that's a little, uh, a little different. 
[00:59:30]  Random wood.  It would just be wood every...  But, dude, every day.  I expected it.  It's like, all right, here it is.  I got the out-of-nowhere wood while I was a caddy.  Yeah.  And ladies, you don't understand what that's like.  When you just get the wood out of nowhere, you can't just leave it there.  It doesn't...  You gotta...  Sometimes you gotta push on it.  Yeah.  You gotta go like, uh, and give it that...  Red racket, red racket.  Just grab it and squeeze.  You just gotta go, urgh. 
[01:00:00]  You know, you're not doing anything with it, but you just gotta...  You gotta push it against something.  You gotta kind of bend it.  Bend it into...  You gotta do something with it.  You gotta give it the grip and just...  I was a caddy at the Huntington Crescent Club, and just like Caddyshack, what's his name?  Caddying for that old couple.  That's a peach, hon.  Right.  I would have to caddy for people like that all the time.  Yeah.  And sometimes I would get the random wood caddying for them.  It's like, why is it happening now?  Hold on. 
[01:00:30]  Uh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Matt, you're next to the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's going on?  What's going on?  What is whole place sucks?  I'm not right, it sucks.  Opie, uh, when you were in the grammar school cafeteria, you had less trade bait than the  frickin' Rangers.  Oh, that'll leave a bruise like my apple today.  No trade bait.  Nature.  Nice.  Nice, Matt.  So, I don't know.  Here's a guy that's admitting he got the school bus wood, too. 
[01:01:00]  Paul, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  What's up?  I'm totally with you.  I used to get wood on the school bus.  No idea why.  It would just happen.  Yeah, and I don't know if it was the vibration.  You know, certainly there wasn't any hot chicks on my butt.  It's crazy.  It would just happen, and then you'd have to hope it would go away before you had to get off the bus.  Horrible.  Because you can't hold your books in front of you like that.  You'd have to hold them to the side and kind of walk sideways. 
[01:01:30]  You get off the bus with that.  Horrible.  Just humiliation.  All right.  If you were Opie, you'd just start spanking it right in the seat.  He doesn't seem to care who's watching.  We're just sticking into the bruised part of the apple.  Red rocket, red rocket, red rocket, red rocket, red rocket, red rocket.  Whatever works, man.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, how are you guys forgetting about the always reliable, flip it up under your belt?  That's what I mean.  You adjust it around and stuff.  Yeah, you have to adjust.  Flip it up, man.  It goes away once you flip it up after a few minutes. 
[01:02:00]  You've got to be packing a certain amount to do that, though.  In your fourth grade, it doesn't reach the belt.  Yeah, right?  That's it, Brian?  That's it.  Okay, I thought you had something else.  He said something out there, the losers with the four-color pen.  Remember the pen with the four different clicks on it?  And the all-important green ink for your elementary school needs.  See, I was jealous of those people.  You were jealous of that?  I had that?  Yeah, I had the blue and the black ink, but then the red and the green ink. 
[01:02:30]  What are you doing with a red and green ink in elementary school?  I had, like, a pen from Hilton.  Oh, really?  Or the Hyatt.  You'd have to hit it with the lighter every so often on the tip to get it working again.  Without a doubt, that was me.  You poor bastard.  You just had a lot of kids in my family.  What can I tell you?  All right.  Oh, Stephanie McMahon will be calling this fine radio show today.  Yes.  She's finally going to confront the breast issue. 
[01:03:00]  The lovely Stephanie McMahon Helmsley.  Her boobs, quite frankly, scare me.  Are they frightening now?  They are huge.  Nice.  Nice.  They're huge, and I don't even know if they're huge in a good way.  See, they're working it into the storyline now.  I give her a lot of credit because they were just making breast joke after breast joke last night on Raw,  and Jericho just got to give him props.  He was hilarious.  Well, there's an operation there, the WWF, that looks and sees what people are talking about, about wrestling, 
[01:03:30]  and then reacts to it and works with it.  They knew everybody was talking about, does Stephanie have implants now?  Right.  It's the big story going around.  So they hop right on it.  Jericho had before and after pictures.  He did.  Oh, it was funny stuff last night.  I got to give him credit, man.  Jose.  How you doing?  Hey.  Since I'm the first one to find out about it, can I go over there when she goes to your show?  No, she's just going to call in, I think.  Oh, man.  You should stop on the show. 
[01:04:00]  She's much too busy to take the ride from Stanford today.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Talk to you soon.  Well, I hear they have to spend a lot of time massaging them so they don't get hard.  Perhaps that's what it is.  Oh, the breast implants.  Still swollen.  Yeah, they're swollen maybe.  You got to massage them a lot and rub all kinds of lotions into them.  See, I don't know.  What?  You don't think?  I'm getting away from the whole breast implant thing, man.  There was a time in my life I was kind of into, not into when they take their clothes off,  but just like when they have their clothes on, it gives them a nice shape. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  I don't know, man.  Stephanie McMahon, she has so much breast meat that they really had to put a huge implant  in there to kind of, you know, prop them all up.  You think so?  Let's ask her if she packed Triple H sandwiches and grapes.  Daddy, I'm getting implants.  Whatever it takes, Stephanie.  I love it.  An implant match.  Take your bra off, Stephanie, and take it off now.  There's got to be a picture of her boob job on the internet.  Yeah. 
[01:05:00]  From last night especially.  See, everyone is saying they're way too big.  Sully.  What's up?  Hey.  At first they look low, like they were wrapped, you know, like they had just gotten done.  Yeah.  But now it's like four weeks later, so they got to be, this is the finished product,  and they look huge.  They're huge.  And too low.  Well, there's a lot of weight up there now.  And she's tiny.  Yeah.  She's a beautiful lady.  They should have given to the other chick from UCW or whatever.  We've had her in the studio a bunch of times. 
[01:05:30]  She's beautiful.  I want to ask her why she finally decided to do it, because she told us on this show,  I wish we could find the tape before she calls, where she said she would never get it done,  because she wants the breast feed someday.  Wow.  All right, so.  She's ready.  Red Rocket.  Red Rocket.  Red Rocket.  Getting back to that for a second, the whole getting wood on the bus.  Yeah.  Another thing, somebody, Stu, on 7 reminded me, because he's talking about dancing.  Stu.  Yes.  Hey, boys.  What's up, man?  I'm actually a good friend of Stockbroker Dave's. 
[01:06:00]  Anyway.  Tell him we said hey.  Tell him we said hello?  Yeah, without a doubt.  I remember being 13 and going to a bar mitzvah, or 16 at a sweet 16, and you're dancing a  slow dance with a girl.  Yep.  It didn't even have to be a slow dance, even a fast dance, and you're sporting the wood.  Yeah.  And the dance is over.  Now you've got to walk back to your seat, and you've got this big protrusion sticking  out of your tight pants that you've got on there.  And you couldn't even adjust it.  You couldn't adjust it while you were doing anything.  I remember this because gym class, you do square dancing. 
[01:06:30]  They open up the ominous accordion doors between the guys' and girls' side of the gym, and  it's just like free meat.  And you were young.  You know, I'm not even talking 13.  I'm talking when I was maybe like 10 years old.  Wait, can I slow you down, though, about the square dancing?  And then they would have the girls lined up, and then the guys lined up, and you'd start  counting going, okay, who am I going to get?  Who am I going to get?  One, two, three, four.  Am I going to get Michelle Antorino this time?  And then you see the girls adjusting? 
[01:07:00]  You're like, oh, man, I'm the freak.  No one wants me.  You're throwing me off here.  I don't want the retarded girl that wet herself last year.  Well, I got to be the one that does the square dancing with the girl in the wheelchair.  Happened.  Everyone get ready.  Today, we're doing square dancing.  All of a sudden, you'd hear the doors that start opening, those big hangar doors.  And you're like, oh, my God, we're doing square dancing. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  And like they said, they line up.  But the second, especially at like 10 or 11 like that, maybe even 12, when you just  like grab the girl's hands and like because of your square dancing, you got to like touch  each other, the arms maybe or something like that.  It was like, oh.  That's sex.  That's sex at that age.  Without a doubt, that's sex at that age.  It was great.  And you'd get like a, you'd get a stiffy going.  Yeah.  And now you couldn't dare put your hand down there to adjust because then you're the kid 
[01:08:00]  that was touching himself during square dancing.  So you just had to like kind of do it with your leg.  You do the little over thing with your leg.  Get back there.  Back in position.  But that was, that was like sex back then.  Remember that?  You get that, your hands get all like sweaty and stuff.  Grammy.  Yeah.  Sex for, for me in grammar school was the rope.  The rope.  Climbing the rope.  You would actually get wood on the rope.  Wood.  And. 
[01:08:30]  You didn't.  I, did you finish?  Oh yeah.  On the rope?  Oh yeah.  Oh God.  Oh yeah.  That is really, really sad.  Horrible desperation.  Yeah.  I made love to a rope.  I was young though.  Third, fourth grade.  And that's the first time I went, whoa, wow.  Look at this.  So you were climbing up the rope.  Had no clue that that's, you know, there was something else going on with my, my junk.  So you just kept going?  Well, I kept going up to the top and went, wow.  And then the slide down. 
[01:09:00]  The slide down.  Did it?  The finishing move.  And then I, and then I had to run to the, uh, the locker room.  Like awful.  That was a great day though.  Great day.  But that's an awful friction.  I mean, do you wear an oven mitt when you whack your bag?  I know.  But that's when I discovered that there's something else going on down there.  Well, yeah.  I knew it when I was in the woods with a girl named Julie and there were sticker bushes and  I liked her hiney.  I was in like second grade.  Yeah.  And I was trying to kiss her hiney and I'm like, well, you can sit on my lap or you can 
[01:09:30]  sit in the sticker bushes.  And she sat in the sticker bushes.  That's why I have no self-esteem.  Sticker bushes.  That is funny because back then that like, uh, looking at a girl's ass like that was,  was the thing.  Um, I would go, I swear to God, I remember this when I was, I probably not even seven  yet.  And there was a girl that lived around the corner and I would knock on her door.  She would come out.  We never hung out or did anything.  We'd go behind her shed in the back and she would show me her ass. 
[01:10:00]  And that was it.  I was like, Hey, thanks.  Yeah.  I'll leave some, I'll leave some cash on the night table for you.  Well, let's be honest.  Let's be honest though.  When was the last time you saw a ass that good sis?  Now you have to lie.  Your mom's sick.  Get in the car.  It was so easy back then.  That's horrible.  Uh, Scott, what's up?  What's up there, yo?  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  How's it going, man?  Hey, yo, I got to tell you, what is it going, what's going on with these fake, these implant 
[01:10:30]  things, man?  Why is it that, and why is it that every porno flick I get, the chicks got implants?  You got to get the older ones, dude.  And it's like, they so far apart, you can drive a damn car between them.  Yeah, there's some real discount.  It's like they don't have no previous.  Like he said, once they take their clothes off, I'm through with the movie, yo.  I can watch it when they got their clothes on.  They look pretty good when they're nice and sit up under the shirt.  We've got a lot of-  As soon as they take the damn shirt off.  Does any chick think it looks hot when they're getting on all fours with the implants and you  see the ripples? 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, the ripples on the side.  They're the ripples from the bed.  Oh my God, I'm like, is that the skin stretcher?  What's up with that?  Scott, I can't tell you how many times we've been disappointed.  A girl will come in to do whatever, and she's got a sweater on or something, and she's got  the big boobs, and I mean, I look at him, and he looks at me like, all right, I can't  wait to see this.  And hold on, hold on.  And they take it off, and you're completely disappointed.  They're like two softballs just sticking straight out.  Nice.  And then the nipples got these big old cuts around them.  Yeah, that's another thing. 
[01:11:30]  That's when you go to a bad doctor, you can get some nasty stuff.  Or they get the gash underneath that looks like a coin slot.  Yeah.  With the Marty Feldman nips.  Yeah.  The Jack Elam.  Listen.  That's the other guy.  That other thing you're talking about?  Yeah.  You know, visiting with your little neighbor's friend when you was, there was a little girl  named Jennifer when I was a kid.  I must have been like eight, nine years old.  Yeah.  We used to ride our bikes together.  We used to go in the shed.  And she would pull down her pants and show me the thing. 
[01:12:00]  You know what I'm saying?  The coochie.  The coochie.  In the shed.  Yeah.  And then we would go in the house, and we had this thing where we'd get potato chips  and put ketchup on them.  Nice.  You know, and he, oh, it was the best, man.  It used to be the shed.  Now it's just AOL chat rooms.  That's the only thing she was kind of fat.  You know what I'm saying?  All right, Scott.  We've got to cut you off.  Thank you.  All right, y'all.  Take care, man.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Scott.  Let's go to John.  We've got to take a break.  We're trying to catch up a little bit.  Frank and Nips.  John.  What's up, John?  Hey.  Listen, supposedly the story with her implants is this.  Stephanie McMahon, go ahead.  Yeah, right after Armageddon last year, Triple H got hurt for about three, four weeks. 
[01:12:30]  He was off TV.  Yeah.  She was thinking about getting the implants.  They did it then just so they wouldn't have to explain, like, where's Stephanie?  Why isn't she with Triple H right now?  Triple H got hurt.  Had to take about three, four weeks off.  She gets the implants because she wasn't on TV.  When he wasn't around.  Gotcha.  All right, guys?  Thank you, John.  Later, man.  We will get to the bottom of this.  For your viewing pleasure.  Oh, good.  You got pictures.  Our listeners rock.  From last night's Raw is War. 
[01:13:00]  We got to make it fast.  We're running really late.  Here's the before and after pictures of Stephanie McMahon on the big screen.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  On the TitanTron.  And look at this.  Because at first I'm thinking maybe it's just a storyline and they're patting her boobs.  She lost some weight, too.  She's looking good.  Yeah.  But look at this.  Her in the middle of the ring.  That is a boob job, my friend.  Oh, yeah.  And look at this one.  Oh, come on.  Absolutely.  And those pictures don't do the boobs justice.  They are freaking huge. 
[01:13:30]  The before shot, very saggy, but big.  Look at her arm, too.  Do you see this?  Yeah, the arm difference.  It's like another girl.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She lost a lot of weight.  Oh, wow.  Her arm's not as big in the second shot there.  Yeah, that's good.  That anorexia stuff's got some merit.  It certainly does.  All right.  Oh, shut up.  The finger down the throat diet.  I love that.  God.  I got a story about that, too.  I love it.  You do?  Oh, man.  This girl I went out with in Geneseo. 
[01:14:00]  We don't have time.  Nothing better than that make-out session.  Remind me when we get back.  All right.  Because I got a puke story.  Actually, I got two anorexic stories.  I got three puke stories.  Nah.  My hard-earned money ended up in the toilet after a good meal.  Yeah, but just the fact that she's so hurt makes it worth it.  All right.  We'll be back.  Stephanie McMahon on the show today at 630.  She's calling in.  Kimmy from Survivor, our friend.  She's right around the corner.  She's stopping in.  And is Jay Moore stopping by?

I would give Ozzy a happy ending with my mouth.  Wow.  That's a fan.  Not gay if you're doing it out of respect.  Well, who are you, Ken?  You would do that for a Kajagoogoo reunion.  Kajagoogoo, always funny. 
[01:16:30]  Kajagoogoo.  Too shy shy.  Hush eye to eye.  Stinks.  That stinks.  Not a homosexual actor.  Michelle.  Thank you.  Yes.  Is this the Michelle?  This is the Michelle.  From Centiport?  Centiport.  Washington Drive School?  Washington, yes.  Wow.  Is this Greg Hughes?  Oh.  Is this somebody from the past opening? 
[01:17:00]  We were talking about square dancing.  I know.  I didn't hear it.  I was just coming in from work, and my cousin called me on the phone.  She goes, did you go to school with someone named Greg Hughes?  And I'm like, yes.  She goes, well, he's talking about you.  And I said, oh, my God.  He said, give me the phone number.  I got a call.  Yeah.  We were talking about, like, Washington Drive square dancing and stuff.  Yeah.  And how I wanted to be, you know, paired up with you.  Well, you know who was in my dentist's office the other day?  Who?  Mrs. McCutcheon.  She's still alive?  Yeah.  Holy, yeah.  She's got to be 80. 
[01:17:30]  85.  She was in the dentist's office.  Opie, was this the hot girl that was walking around the halls?  Michelle was very hot at the time.  Yeah.  I haven't seen her in many years.  Are you going to the reunion?  Yeah.  Are you married and stuff?  Married with three children.  Wow.  Yeah.  To think I wanted you and stuff.  You would have had to supply some kids.  I was too shy back then.  Man, I wanted you so bad it wasn't even funny.  I knew when I was in, like, third or fourth grade I wanted you.  Look at these little confessions coming out.  Oh, man.  This girl was the hottest girl growing up. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, yeah.  And what grades?  Around?  All the way to senior in high school at Harford Hills High School.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, Michelle, you ever notice me?  Yes, Greg.  I remember you.  No, but I mean red hair and freckles.  I remember you.  Ah, see?  Did you remember, like...  How is that ever hot or sexy?  I remember you.  Red hair and freckles.  I remember, and he was really skinny.  Ah, here I am thinking, you know, maybe you noticed me, like, in a sexual way.  If he ever came up to you back then...  Yes, I used to talk to him all the time.  But, like, asked you to go out? 
[01:18:30]  No.  Maybe?  Would you ever?  No.  Oh, see?  Well, good thing you didn't...  No, not on the...  Try that.  Didn't you have a monkey growing up?  Yes, I did.  Yes.  Damn.  Tom Asena.  I brought him in for show and tell.  Yes, you did.  This girl was so freaking hot.  And I was too scared to ask her anything.  You talked to me.  I didn't ignore you.  We held hands once, like, when we were in, I don't know, second or third grade.  Why was that?  I don't know.  I was working it.  That was working it in the second grade.  You had up until the twelfth grade, and you got nowhere. 
[01:19:00]  And ask Michelle.  How pathetic was I in high school?  How small and thin was I?  You were very skinny.  Yeah.  Very skinny.  And very short.  Well, you know, you hear what they say at reunions.  Huh.  The ones that always don't look good wind up looking good when at the, you know, when  they go back.  Yeah, exactly.  And the ones that were really good looking look terrible.  So do you still look good?  Uh-oh.  I look the same, put it that way, except for more gray hair.  Wow.  Wow.  I just have a lot of gray hair.  You're going to your reunion now?  I'm going to the reunion. 
[01:19:30]  I sent my money in.  I'm already set to go.  All right, Michelle.  So you're going to be there?  Yeah, we'll see you there, all right?  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Three kids.  Three kids.  Fantasy is now over.  Wow.  Opie, I was listening earlier about Sandy catching you on the couch.  Yeah.  And, uh.  Oh, no.  Jay Moore, everyone.  Hi.  Hello, everyone.  Hello, all syndicates.  Hello, America, right now.  Right.  Yeah, we could call it America.  I was in Dallas, and they totally know who you are.  You're on 105-something. 
[01:20:00]  I was looking for you.  I couldn't find you, but my driver, I got two drivers hooked on you in Dallas.  Oh, yeah?  One's a Kenyan who drives the van shuttle, and he's like, man, these guys are the best.  And the other guy drives here in New York, my man.  Right on.  All right.  So, uh, I just thought, you know, in a town in Long Island, a boy named Greg Hughes was  born.  Then, 30 years later, his girlfriend opens her eyes to find him punching his clown on the 
[01:20:30]  couch.  The millions of monies that he's made, the millions in prizes, the fans, the adulation,  the partner that kept him afloat in rough times and vice versa, the love of his fellow  comedians.  Nothing could prepare him for the day his wife opened up her eyes and saw him.  That's a euphemism.  Wait, you can't say that.  You can't say that one.  She wakes up and sees the pillow moving up and down.  Quietly, she moves to the apartment.  She quickly pretends to be asleep, so Greg isn't on to her, watching him punch his clown. 
[01:21:00]  How did that, you're watching Greg Hughes, Beyond the Glory.  A man with millions of dollars in syndication, still on his own couch, getting caught by his  girlfriend punching his clown.  That is truly Beyond the Glory.  It's sad.  Syndicate, millions of dollars, doesn't matter.  You still gotta hump, you still gotta hump furniture once in a while. 
[01:21:30]  Pathetic.  Yeah.  Trying to shoot his web across the television a la Spider-Man.  Make a map of Hawaii on his own belly.  He was caught red-handed.  And when your wife or girlfriend catches you doing that, no matter how many money...  Why can't I speak to that?  How many money?  How many money?  I'm like a four-year-old.  I've been hanging out with too many Kenyans.  I was just gonna say, you're just faster than me, you jerk.  Especially when you're caught punching your clown watching the movie Rush Hour. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  What the hell was that about?  I wasn't paying attention.  The movie sucked.  Chris Tucker's got a pretty mouth.  Speaking of Beyond the Glory, I gotta give you props.  The Bill Buckner one last night.  Man, is that a good one.  That is a good Beyond the Glory.  How about the footage of Buckner going, hey, you know, probably the worst thing that could  ever happen to you in your whole career would be having a ball go through your legs  in the World Series and lose it.  Oh, God, yeah.  It was like in a local affiliate a week before the World Series.  Yeah.  But the man's got like 2,500 hits. 
[01:22:30]  He's got a higher batting average than 70% of the Hall of Fame.  No one will ever remember that.  He's got more hits than Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle.  I didn't know that.  Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra.  There's a lot of guys.  He's, you know, he's the best defensive first.  He was Buckner, man.  He was nuts.  He played a long time.  He was in left field for Hank Aaron 714th.  Right.  Roller up the first baseline.  It's behind the bank.  Yeah, but my brother and I were discussing it.  Mookie Wilson was going to beat that out.  The inning was going to be alive still, no matter what.  If Buckner catches that, he's, that guy was a football player. 
[01:23:00]  Buckner was not going to make it the first before Mookie did.  And the pitcher was not.  He was back to make that play.  Look at me defending a Red Sox.  A Red Sox.  Yes, you are.  Oh, it's August.  Have you seen the Red Sox start in a little spiral?  Isn't it?  It must be August, Boston.  Because down you go.  Pitcher didn't cover the bag.  Mookie was going to beat out that play.  Whatever, man.  Let me see.  Give me a little audio over here.  Let me see.  I'll take a look at it. 
[01:23:30]  You're going to take a look at the play?  Yeah.  I'll take a look at it, too.  Let's take a look.  All right.  Here we go.  Let me go to...  Look for Mookie.  I can't do that.  Mookie!  Oh, you just got the audio?  Yeah.  Here we go.  Okay.  Let me play.  So the winning run is at second base with two outs.  Three and two to Mookie Wilson.  Little roller up along first.  Behind the bag!  It gets through a buzzer!  Here comes Knight, and the Mets win it! 
[01:24:00]  Oh, God.  That hurts.  Hey, sorry, Boston, but God damn, that hurt.  He totally would have made that play.  All he would have had to do is lean forward.  Yeah.  He was right there.  He would have beat him to the bag.  No way.  No way.  Dude, he dives with the mitt, tags the bag.  The World Series is over.  The run wouldn't have scored.  The inning would have still been, you know, alive.  Look, I'm a huge Mets fan, but after watching the Beyond the Glory, I felt for the guy.  Well, his kid's getting abused in school.  His wife having to listen in the other room as a reporter's asking if he ever thought about 
[01:24:30]  killing himself.  No, the reporter asked his wife, did your husband ever think about killing himself?  That's horrible.  She's like, say what?  He's married to this big black lady.  It's so weird.  No, he's not.  Oh, wait.  What are we talking about?  Are you insane?  Ever see the Karl Malone one?  His whole family looks like the clumps.  His mother looks just like Karl Malone with a clump wig on.  And his kids, those God damn kids, the first word of English I hear out of their mouths 
[01:25:00]  will be their first.  The boy that he adopted, that was his son from Louisiana Tech.  Yeah.  The kid goes, every time I pass the ball, they say, they padlight.  And every time I shoot the ball, they say, you shoot just like them.  Every time I jump, they say, jump, I'm a dog.  Why can't I just flow like me?  You know what I'm saying?  Abba, dabba, abba, dabba, abba, dabba.  Jesus.  I get hooked into the Beyond the Glory every time it's on.  Every time it's on.  I was watching in the back room of the improv in Dallas. 
[01:25:30]  I was actually watching my own show.  Yeah.  Why not?  It's a good show.  I enjoy it.  Yes.  The Roberto Duran one is the best.  I haven't seen that one yet.  When he goes to Esteban, Esteban D.A.  Seuss is the guy that beat him in the garden.  Yeah.  And he beat him.  And then he died of AIDS later and he went to his hospital room and he picked him up in  his arms.  And in Spanish, he goes, you're my champion.  And Puerto Ricans always hated Roberto Duran because he always beat the crap out of Puerto  Rican fighters and clowned Puerto Rico.  But when he did that, he won all Latino communities. 
[01:26:00]  Like, he was just a man.  Goes to the ghetto, hands his money out to the kids.  He's still fighting.  Good.  Because he needs it.  He fought recently.  Really?  Yeah.  He lost a macho man.  Yeah.  It's macho time, man.  It's macho time, baby.  Every guy that, you know when you pull the plane in and you're not really there yet because  you've got to wait for some Puerto Rican kid in a tractor to tow you at the last six feet.  It's always some kid that looks exactly like Macho Camacho.  He's got a low, his tractor's lowered.  The last six feet.  Chrome Rams, he's like, I'm coming, man. 
[01:26:30]  Take it easy, baby.  Hey, keep your seatbelt on, man.  You're going four miles an hour, baby.  It's macho time.  Macho time.  Get it, man.  I'm uncircumcised, man.  That's funny.  Stacey.  Yes.  I went to school with you two.  Yes, you did.  Don't tell me you don't remember me.  Washington Drive.  Stacey.  A car.  A car.  Stacey.  Stacey.  Stacey.  I'm going to have to look you up in the yearbook.  Oh, come on.  How would I remember you? 
[01:27:00]  You remembered me at the 10-year reunion.  Oh.  What does that mean?  And what does that mean?  Wait.  Here comes Rick.  What happened at the 10-year reunion?  Not much.  I was pregnant, so.  Oh.  Why?  Was I trying to jump on top of you?  No.  We did exchange pleasantries at the reunion.  Pleasantries?  Come on.  I was at Washington Drive.  A handy?  Happy ending?  Yeah.  What did I do?  Did I feel you up or anything?  No.  Like I said, I was pregnant, you know?  All right. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, but I have a little thing for pregnant girls.  Did he feel the baby kick without his hands?  No.  Did you service him?  Did you manipulate him some way?  Hey, this is Stacey.  Isn't this horrible?  This is Stacey.  You see, I'm not Michelle, so I guess you don't remember.  I wasn't a cheerleader.  Oh, still jealous.  Wait, I'll look you up when I get home.  Refresh my memory.  Yeah, describe yourself, maybe a situation that happened in school.  Who did you take in the bathroom at the reunion that was pregnant?  You don't remember getting some pregnant ass?  I didn't take her to the bathroom.  Yeah, really?  Her husband was probably there, right? 
[01:28:00]  No, that's the best part.  Stace?  Yes.  How am I going to remember you?  Oh, I don't know.  I guess I'm not memorable enough.  Oh, wow.  I think it's Stalker Padding.  Those high school wounds run deep.  My brother called and told me, oh, you got to turn on O&A.  They're talking about Washington Drive, so.  Yeah, my old school.  So you told your brother what you did with O.B. in the bathroom?  My children are going to go to Washington Drive.  I'm not talking about the bathroom party at BAB.  Oh, it's not the BAB bathroom party?  No, no, no, no. 
[01:28:30]  That's another story for another time, my friend.  The reunion.  The reunion.  Stacey?  Yes.  Refresh my memory.  Oh, I don't know.  I was a track.  I ran.  Track?  I was friends with, let me see who.  You weren't field hockey, were you?  No, I wasn't field hockey.  Those wacky girls with the plaid skirts and those stupid sticks.  No.  What's this girl's name again?  Stacey.  Stacey had it all.  Running track.  Straight A student.  Two months after graduation.  Nine months pregnant.  Servicing Opie in a bathroom.  Not the way her life had planned out. 
[01:29:00]  You're watching Stacey.  Stacey, pregnant and full.  Beyond the glory.  I love the paul.  Ding, ding.  All right, Stacey.  So I missed if you're going to be at the reunion, but I guess it doesn't matter now.  Yeah, you know what?  The more you keep talking like a bitch, you're right.  Goodbye.  Wow.  Enough already.  It's like having a Jewish mother.  Stacey, why are you insulted?  No, I just thought, no.  Do we got a little something going on?  No, we never did.  So then what the hell are you talking about?  Is that the only thing you remember?  Then you don't remember anything from high school. 
[01:29:30]  Wow.  Oh, that was a little jab she got out of you.  Nice.  That was pretty good.  You got to give her that.  I didn't really go out with many girls in high school, so I know I didn't go out with you.  Yeah, you know that.  No.  I was like, I just...  Any memorable story?  I know.  Help me out, Stacey.  No, you know what?  It'll hurt your image because you're a very sweet, nice boy.  Did he pose you in the uterus at the reunion?  No.  Were you ever in the same room together in school?  Yeah, we were.  I don't remember.  Doing something memorable?  I think Opie did something mean to her at the reunion.  Yeah, what did I do to you?  Nothing.  You were very nice, always. 
[01:30:00]  Shh.  Don't tell anyone that.  I know.  It's not good for your image.  All right, Stacey.  Now we know what you were thinking all the time, though.  Yeah, right?  Because he will now.  No, no.  I'm still the nice kid from Centerport, Long Island.  Yeah.  All right, Stacey.  All right.  Well, maybe I'll see you.  Wow.  Wow.  You are just getting the guilt thing thrown on you all.  Stace.  Oh, my God, Stacey.  Start your car in your garage.  Roll down the window.  Stacey, yes.  Make sure the door is closed. 
[01:30:30]  You still married?  Yes.  But it seems like you might have...  Second husband?  No.  It seems like you might have...  And I'm still in Centerport.  But it seems like you might have a little something for me.  No.  You're going to be still trying to work the girls' way out to work.  All right, Stacey.  We'll see you in November, all right?  Are you going to be there?  Hell yeah.  We'll see you.  All right, bye.  Why would you go...  Unless people I knew in school, unless they were the pot-smoking crew, they wouldn't know  who I was either.  She was really angry, though.  Why was she angry? 
[01:31:00]  She was a pot.  She wasn't even angry.  She was, like...  She was a mope.  Well, I guess you'll...  She was a mope.  I guess you won't remember me.  She was Jeff George, Week 12.  I'm sure if I saw...  I'm sure if I saw her picture, it would all come back to me.  Maybe.  Never know.  All right.  We're doing the WOW Summit tomorrow, Anthony.  Is the WOW Summit finally happening?  What is that?  This is pretty cool.  Philadelphia.  We're crossing state lines.  Philadelphia is starting to get the whole Opie and Anthony experience, and they're putting  WOW in the back of their cars, and girls are starting to flash down in Philly. 
[01:31:30]  So, we've got Keith the Cop and a bunch of guys on Harleys with really hot girls going  from New York to Philly all day tomorrow on the show, and then we're going to meet up  in Philly and give them a little son.  Convoy.  Right.  Keep on trucking.  Convoy.  Venture game through the night.  Can I be Spider Mike?  Remember, you ride bikes as a kid, you'd be like, I have a Peterbilt.  No, I had it.  All right.  I got a Mac.  Breaker, breaker.  I'm Spider Mike.  We're counting on people to join the convoy along the way. 
[01:32:00]  When is this?  This weekend?  No, it's tomorrow during the show.  They're going to leave at 3 by 5, 530.  I would totally do it.  They're going to get to a location in Philadelphia, I guess a bar.  Nice.  You think?  That works.  And then they drive back faster.  We're going to go to the church and then drive back.  Here's the details, Ben.  We start here at the station at 3 o'clock and then through the Lincoln Tunnel and all the  way down through Jersey and into Philadelphia.  And the final stop will be at a bower called the Maui Entertainment Complex on Delaware Avenue. 
[01:32:30]  But all the stops are up on opiananthony.com.  Earl has nothing to do with this, right?  I don't know.  Maybe he'll get a DUI on the way down.  Yeah, we've got to talk about Earl and his sobriety test he's got to do this weekend.  F you, Anthony.  And he's really pissed off, doesn't want to talk about it, but we have to talk about it.  As he's throwing things around, it looked like an old Samsonite commercial in the back.  I quit.  Did he quit today again?  Yeah, he told me. 
[01:33:00]  He said he was leaving.  Yeah, he was going to leave this morning.  Go after yourself.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  What's up, dude?  Thank you.  What can you add to the WOW Summit?  What can I add?  Well, Ben gave the directions we're taking tomorrow, right?  Yeah.  A lot of people want to join you guys for the ride, so where are you guys starting from  and at what time?  We're going to be coming up to the studio saying a quick hello when we go on air at 3 o'clock.  All right.  All right.  We're probably looking to get out at about 3.15, 3.30 the latest.  Okay.  And we're going to head right through the Lincoln Tunnel.  All right. 
[01:33:30]  Figuring there's supposed to be a rest stop someplace right outside the Lincoln Tunnel.  Yeah.  We're probably going to stop there, gas up, and then head on.  Is it the Valley Madison or the Vince Lombardi?  All right.  It's the Vince Lombardi?  All right.  So maybe you can pick up some fans and listeners at that rest stop.  Right.  Right.  We've got about seven or eight motorcycles going.  We've got breasts for everybody.  We've got big breasts.  We've got real breasts.  We've got small breasts.  We've got big breasts.  Scarred breasts.  People, we've got breasts! 
[01:34:00]  You can go to opianthony.com for the directions and all the info on this.  Yeah.  We've got a little bit of everything.  And foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  All right.  That's good.  All right.  We'll do it tomorrow, Keith.  All right.  Talk to you tomorrow.  You know, I got a quick segue.  Yep.  Because people love nude women and breasts.  They're being used as weapons now in the Middle East in the battle between Israel and Palestine.  Get this, a Palestinian newspaper accusing Israel of mounting striptease female soldiers on tanks to lure Palestinians and then shoot them dead. 
[01:34:30]  They're using naked women, putting them on tanks.  Then they get out of the tank.  They start doing this little striptease.  As a decoy.  Right.  And then the guys get closer.  Some people said they're disgusted.  And they get closer to throw rocks at the girls.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Others just want to see because they're curious.  And when the protesters approached to throw stones at the nearly nude female soldier, she reportedly whipped a pistol out of her underwear and shot two dead and wounded nine. 
[01:35:00]  That shows you how, you know, not only do they throw rocks, but the Palestinians must have rocks in their head.  Because even if there's a naked woman, I'm pretty sure it still says freaking Israel on the tank.  A big Jewish star means na-na.  It's popping up.  Look, a naked woman.  They're all running up like that.  You ever see the opening of 2001 when they're looking at the...  Apes at the monolith. 
[01:35:30]  Throwing things.  Well, nude women.  Those Palestinians love to throw rocks, man.  Yeah.  Anthony, black Earl on the phone.  Thank God.  Earl.  Earl.  What?  How's your job being a police officer in Brooklyn going?  Earl?  Yes.  Um, I missed the shenanigans that were going on earlier today.  Hijinks.  Everyone, just to clear up a couple of things, because I hate being called a liar.  All right.  Particularly when no one was there.  All right.  Hold on.  Can we give the basics so people can play along at home? 
[01:36:00]  Ben, why don't you...  Yes, I was pulled over in Middletown for speeding.  Hold on.  No, I was not given a sobriety test.  All right.  Yes, Marty, our intern, was drunk.  That's a fact.  Wait, slow down, Matthew Broderick.  Go ahead again.  All right.  Wait, you were going to a promotion over the weekend?  Yeah, we were going to the Stone Pony.  All right.  Vince Neil, yes.  I thought the Stone Pony hated us.  Yeah, what happened there?  Were you driving the lead singer of Hanoi Rocks?  No. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, Jay Moore's bringing it to Cleveland Thursday.  Come on, Cleveland.  Rally around me here.  Earl, are you still going to be able to do sticker stops with one arm?  All right, so you're driving.  You know, Metallica hasn't been the same since you died.  Oh, he's just...  I knew he'd push him too far.  We can't hold back.  Go to line five.  All right, hold on.  No, get Earl...  Earl, you're listening.  Get back on the phone.  You may never hold back.  Let's give the whole rundown, though.  What happened? 
[01:37:00]  Cliff Burton reference.  Freaking...  You like my Cliff Burton?  Excellent.  Nice.  This morning, Matt Devote comes in and goes,  you're not going to believe what happened to Earl on Friday night.  And Earl got...  Earl left late for his sticker stop or whatever on Friday...  or his appearance on Friday night  and decided to go like 65 down back roads in Jersey.  Now, he has to be on the Jersey Shore on a Friday night,  which is just a nightmare driving by 10 o'clock.  He leaves here at 8.30.  It's normally on a straight run with no traffic, an hour and a half drive. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, and I found out more information.  Yeah.  I was talking to Marty, the intern who was with him,  and I remember Earl bitching to me at 8 o'clock  while I'm putting together Saturday's show,  the last finishing touches.  It's not about you, Rick.  Yes.  And Earl is standing around.  You're such a douche.  Yeah.  It's funny because it's true.  And Earl is standing around,  and he's just bitching and moaning about the salespeople.  You know, those people piss me off. 
[01:38:00]  I'm going to lodge a complaint  because they're always complaining about me being late.  I've been late once, and he's just going on and on.  I'm late all the time.  Yeah.  All right, Earl's calling back.  And it turns out,  Earl didn't leave until after 8 o'clock at the station.  Right.  So he leaves here and runs into this traffic.  This is what we've heard.  Oh, but this is better.  He didn't go right to Jersey when he left here.  Oh, all right.  He went down to some sports guy's thing.  He didn't leave the city until 9 o'clock.  Oh.  He didn't leave,  but he was in the city at 9 o'clock still. 
[01:38:30]  So is this Earl calling back?  That should be Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Now we also hear...  Rick is lying.  I've got a cat receipt to prove it.  Now we also hear that he got pulled over.  The cops took him out of the vehicle,  gave him a sobriety test.  Now Earl doesn't drink,  but he was driving a little erratically  to get there on time.  And Marty was drunk off his ass,  but he's in the passenger seat.  Now Earl is saying  that they gave Marty a breathalyzer.  I didn't say that.  I didn't say that.  I didn't say that in the office.  Oh, my God. 
[01:39:00]  Hey, Earl,  is Exxon going to hire you back?  I didn't.  Earl.  Yeah.  Earl.  Don't let him hang up yet  because we've got to get some info out of him.  You're driving...  Did you get pulled over?  We got pulled over.  Okay, all right.  For speeding, right?  For speeding.  Yes, I admit.  That's amazing right there  that the wow van can speak.  Okay.  I was going 65 in a 25-mile-an-hour zone.  Right.  So you get pulled over.  That I admit.  Did you...  Were you asked to step out of the vehicle?  Yes.  Okay.  Were you asked to perform certain tasks 
[01:39:30]  to see physically if you were intoxicated?  Absolutely not.  You were not asked to walk the line,  touch your nose,  or any sobriety...  Nothing.  ...field sobriety test?  Nothing.  Was Marty given a breathalyzer?  It was not.  The other cop showed up  and he knew who I was.  He was talking with Marty.  I was talking with another cop.  I had no idea what was going on  between Marty and the other cop.  Earl, how did he know you?  Did he see Jessica Lange on your shoulder?  Holy S, Norman. 
[01:40:00]  Earl?  Did you guys see Planet of the World?  Oh, damn it.  I knew he'd hang up  if we pushed him too far.  He hung up.  Now, let's get Marty's side of the story  because Marty was all drunk.  He was there.  Marty.  Marty.  What's up, guys?  Were you hammered?  Yeah, I was...  Still hammered.  Really intoxicated.  Okay.  So you're hammered.  You get pulled over.  Right.  Walk us through the traffic stop.  Well, we're going...  First of all,  we're going down the parkway  and it's jam-packed.  And I live in Jersey, 
[01:40:30]  so I said,  all right, Earl, get off here.  I'm like,  we'll go through my neighborhood  and we'll get there this way.  So Earl's going like 65 down the highway  and it's a 50-mile-an-hour zone  and he's swerving inside,  in and out of traffic.  It's like...  It's a two-lane highway  and he's driving straight  in the dead center of the highway.  All right.  And...  Reckless.  We know that.  And that's why he got pulled over.  I said to Earl,  I was like,  Earl,  this is a huge speed trap. 
[01:41:00]  You're going to get pulled over.  As soon as I said that,  lights go on.  All right.  The cop comes up.  Where are you guys going?  And he rolls down the window.  The cop smelled booze on me.  All right.  Now, yeah,  you probably have the whole place  reeking like a brewery.  So that's why the cop thought  Earl might have been drinking.  Yeah.  Well, hold on.  You know what?  I think it would be fun.  When you tell the story,  make up voices  for each different character.  All right.  Well,  Sergeant Stedanko, 
[01:41:30]  let's call him.  All right.  From the Middletown Police Department.  Does he ask Earl  to step out of the vehicle?  Yeah.  All right.  And then what happens?  Then he comes around  to me  and he says,  have you been drinking?  And I said,  yes.  How about your buddy over there?  And I was like,  no,  I don't drink.  He's driving like he drinks.  Uh-huh.  And they take my driver's license.  They take his driver's license.  Another cop comes up  to the vehicle  and starts talking to me.  He's like,  he's like,  wow.  It's not about you, Marty. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  Could you slow down  with this story a little bit?  Marty,  what did they give Earl  a field sobriety test?  They had him  on the side of the curb  talking to him.  Feeding him with sticks.  They had him  behind the van  talking to him.  Yeah.  They had him on the curb.  They were asking him  how much he had to drink.  On the curb.  That is so much.  Making sure he was okay.  No, I mean like,  that's so like  what a cop is doing.  Earl doesn't even drink.  That's what's so funny about that.  Hey, you better sit on the curb. 
[01:42:30]  You're dangerous.  Oh, God.  You better go sit down.  So,  did they give him  a sobriety test?  I couldn't see  from where I was.  Yeah, you were hammered.  I'm going in the back  of the van  grabbing T-shirts  to get to these cops.  Smart.  And so, you know.  You know what would be better?  Lewis telling this story.  Right, right, right.  Earl.  Yes.  Did they make you  touch your nose?  No.  They did not give me  a sobriety test.  They said,  how much have you  been drinking tonight?  They asked me 
[01:43:00]  if I was drinking.  I never touched the stuff.  Those are my exact words.  I never touched.  Joe, you was banana?  Anything, Earl?  Earl,  when was he satisfied  that you weren't drinking  and let you get away?  I was going in.  I knew what I was doing.  And then I was  joking with the other cops.  Earl,  did they give you a ticket?  No,  they gave me a warning.  A warning.  A written warning.  A written warning.  Oh,  a written warning. 
[01:43:30]  Okay.  So,  so why are you  so pissed off today, Earl?  It's a whole other,  there's a whole other  issues involved.  I can't,  it'll just bore  the audience to tears.  Oh, no,  I don't think it will.  Anytime you're pissed off  is gold.  Now,  I hear you didn't leave  the sports guys thing  until 945,  now I'm hearing.  That is not true.  That is not true.  Did you go to  the sports guys appearance?  Yes,  I had to pick up the van.  I took a cab  down at Chelsea Piers.  Knowing you had to be  at Asbury Park 
[01:44:00]  by 10,  why did you stop there?  I had to pick up the van.  The van was already there.  I took a cab down  to Chelsea Piers  to pick up the van.  Oh, brother.  All right.  It would have been faster  if you took a helicopter  ride through the Grand Canyon.  Earl?  Yeah?  Why are you so pissed today?  No,  just down over there.  Hey,  I can't believe  you're doing that.  Behave yourself.  Simmer,  simmer down.  Simmer down.  For the love of Eve,  behave yourself.  Golly gee. 
[01:44:30]  I'm getting all icky  listening to that.  Oh, jeepers.  Chimney cricket.  Earl.  Yeah.  What do you mean  the sales BS?  No,  it's just like  it's never enough  for them.  Vent,  Earl.  What's the matter?  Well,  that's their job.  They're sales whores.  Well,  I know that,  but it's just like  that doesn't mean  we got to take it.  So,  what's the problem?  What do they do to you  to put you over the edge  where you broke  all your stuff today?  Well,  I didn't break anything.  I just broke  two O2Go bottles. 
[01:45:00]  O2Go bottles?  Yeah.  What,  you don't like the product?  I love the product.  I just was holding it  and there was  something close  and I threw it.  Earl was kicking  file cabinets,  throwing bottles.  You hit somebody  with one of the bottles  that you threw  and then you were  slamming doors.  You were very angry,  Earl.  I didn't understand why.  Just sit in the van  and have a drink.  Relax.  Yeah,  just drink it up.  Like Friday.  All right, Earl,  when are you going  to come back in?  We're on our way  back now. 
[01:45:30]  We're about to hit  the West Side Highway.  Well,  why don't you come in  to the studio  and we'll discuss  this a little further.  Get to the bottom  of it,  all right?  There's nothing  really to talk about.  It's just...  Earl,  you know how the radio  works.  You can't say  the S word.  Is it true  Earl was trying  to reach 80 miles  an hour  so he could get  back to the future?  Earl was flying.  He was driving  faster than I've  ever seen him drive.  All right,  Earl,  we're going to get  to the bottom  of this  when you get  back to the station,  okay?  There's nothing  to get to the bottom  of it.  There's nothing 
[01:46:00]  to talk about.  We'll let you vent  and we'll let you  talk about the  salespeople.  I've vented already.  I'm fine.  Who did you wrong?  It sounds like  you're not a fan  of Matt Devote  these days.  Yeah.  He wants in  on this little story,  so come on back  again and we'll  talk about it,  okay?  All right,  Earl.  All right?  It's just like  it's never enough.  It's never right.  And then it's just  like,  what do you want  to do?  Dude,  you keep changing  your story.  Yeah.  All right,  we'll get to the  bottom of it  when he gets in.  Earl?  All right.  Earl. 
[01:46:30]  Earl.  Earl.  Yes.  We're very concerned.  You know,  are you all right  today and stuff?  I mean...  I'm fine.  I'm fine now.  You're not going to cry  or anything,  right?  How's the sticker  stop going?  Quite frankly,  I'm bailing out  on him.  You know,  he's so pissed  off right now.  Oh,  go F yourself.  Go F yourself.  Okay,  still the breast  implants.  Kimmy from Survivor,  Jay Moore in the  studio.  Yes,  Rick?  Update on Stephanie  calling in 545 now.  545,  so right after this

Hey guys,  just got back  from the WOW  sticker stock.  We just had one  today.  And have never  seen a more  disinterested  group of people.  And he's talking  about WNEW  and Lipton people. 
[01:49:00]  I walked up  kind of excited  to see people  from the show.  Said,  hey guys,  what's going on?  And heard crickets.  Earl never turned  around or got up  from the rail  he was sitting on  facing opposite  from where things  should have been  happening.  Some other guy  walked up to me  said,  what's up?  Handed me a couple  of stickers.  That was it.  Take some of that  $30 million  you're making  and buy Earl  a personality. 
[01:49:30]  Earl's going to  lose it today.  This is the day  he has a nervous  breakdown  and quits the show  for good.  This is nothing  new.  This is nothing  new.  I mean,  people always say  they go to these  sticker stops  and what do they  see?  They see Earl  just kind of  moping around,  pissed to be there,  hands out the  stickers.  These things should  be like little,  I'm not talking  about road show,  but just like a  little exciting event,  something going on,  like people coming  up and Earl  maybe smiling 
[01:50:00]  and shaking hands  because people are  kind of excited  to see Earl.  We're doing the  WOW Summit in  Philadelphia tomorrow.  You watch how they  do it in Philadelphia.  Yep.  People are going to  have a great time  tomorrow when the  WOW Summit from  New York makes it  to Philadelphia  during the show.  Could you make  believe you're  having fun?  I mean,  it's not like  you're working a  real job out there.  Sharon, easy.  Hey, what's up?  I have your article.  I'm reading it.  First of all,  you have to replace  Earl.  You have to get a  woman doing it.  Uh-oh.  Because this guy 
[01:50:30]  doesn't even like,  you used to install  air conditioners?  Who?  Oh, Anthony?  Yeah.  Well, I was,  yeah, I did  central air,  heating and ductwork.  It was a tin knocker.  Whatever.  It was air conditioning,  right?  Yes.  I like the way  you upgraded it.  It was central air.  It wasn't like  a window air conditioner.  Right.  Right.  Exactly.  So what happened?  You meet Opie  and you two  just hit it off  and he decides  to give you  $15 million.  What are you guys  getting $30 million?  He decides to give  me $15 million. 
[01:51:00]  Yes, Opie reached  into his wallet  and gave me $15 million.  No, no, no, no.  I know it was beyond that,  but what?  Sharon, where are you from?  I'm from Bay Ridge,  Brooklyn, originally.  All right.  Well, make your point.  Obviously, you're talking  about the article  in New York Magazine  that came out today.  I just can't believe...  I think it's hysterical.  I mean, you guys  are like a train wreck.  Yeah.  You know, you hate...  You look at it  and, you know,  you hate to...  You can't help  listening to you guys.  Like a train wreck.  Well, that's what  we're hoping.  No, I mean,  it's the truth, though. 
[01:51:30]  It's hysterical.  I can't believe  I listen to you guys.  Norton, would you like  to converse  with the lovely Sharon?  Do you know Jim Norton?  I think she was giving  us a compliment, though.  Oh, I know.  No, I am...  I love...  I listen to you guys.  I mean, I waited  for 20 minutes  to talk to you guys.  You waited 20 minutes  to really just babble.  I don't know  what you're getting at.  I'm babbling.  Well, it says on the screen,  just got a New York  Magazine article  with you guys.  Yeah, and they called...  Hold on.  It says,  amazed how O&A  met each other.  Yeah.  I just think  it's hysterical that,  you know,  you used to install  air conditioning. 
[01:52:00]  Yes.  It's like a dream story  out of some kind of...  It really is.  Yeah.  Sometimes it's hard  to believe it's real.  Everybody in the studio  just pinches themselves.  Who is that guy talking?  Jim Norton.  Oh, what does he do there?  He makes cute little...  God, you're nosy.  I make little anecdotes  and I talk to fat girls  who are obsessed  with air conditioning.  Yeah.  Okay.  He's kind of our  exclamation point.  Right.  Oh, okay.  He says...  Like, usually we say things  a lot of people are thinking  and would never say.  He's the period 
[01:52:30]  at the end of the sentence?  He says things  that no one should  ever even think.  Right, about AIDS and...  No, he's not the period.  He is the exclamation point.  Or I'm the period  in the middle  of a good face sitting.  All right, Jerry.  Thanks, I think,  for calling the show.  Okay, take care.  Ah, pooha.  Oh, wait.  Ah, pooha.  Poozaa.  Let's go to Ian.  Ian, what's up?  Hey, how are you?  Oh, wait.  This is Ian  from New York Magazine.  Yeah.  Ah.  And nobody told me  you were going to be  talking about it,  so I didn't hear  a damn thing  until just a minute ago. 
[01:53:00]  We talked about  the article  that's in the August 20th  edition of New York Magazine  for a while today already.  Hey, did you enjoy it?  Yeah, it's fun.  Cool.  How come they  didn't get the cover?  Um, I don't make  these decisions.  Who's on the cover?  Some therapist thing.  Yeah, the cover is  divorcing your therapist.  And the girl on the back  in the Chanel ad  looks like an extra  from Schindler's List.  It says,  is your shrink  holding you hostage?  That's a hot look.  Spoiled New Yorkist.  Toothpick arm.  I think the important  thing here is that  you got the first 
[01:53:30]  gratuitous breast shot  in the magazine's  history.  Yeah.  As far as I can tell.  Oh, nice.  Ian, you did a good job.  Thanks.  Yeah, you did.  The way you described  how Opie's sandwich  is made  was fascinating.  Yeah, thanks, Ian.  Thanks for the 40 minutes  of abuse I got earlier  because of your cute  little observation  about how I have  grapes in a Ziploc bag.  Well, I'm sure  it made for great radio.  Yeah, you gave us  a good break today.  It was a good read.  It was Nabokov-ish.  Excellent.  Thanks a lot. 
[01:54:00]  All right, Ian.  Yeah, pick it up.  It's out there  in New York Magazine  August.  Yeah, we're encouraging  everyone to get the magazine  and we're going to do  like a little magazine  signing party  this Thursday at Hooters  downstairs 56  between Broadway and 7th  because we've been  lucky enough to be  in a bunch of magazines  so we're going to have  some fun with it  on Thursday.  Oh, cool.  Right after the show.  Come on by, all right?  All right, I will.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Have a good time.  All right, bye.  That's a soon-to-be  award-winning journalist,  ladies and gentlemen.  Ian, they did a good job.  Well, he's smart enough  to do an article on you guys. 
[01:54:30]  He's got that going for him.  Yes.  He's not doing  the Ben Affleck rehab story.  Oh, that is, dude,  don't make fun of that.  That's so sad.  They let him out?  What is that story, Ben?  They let Adam go  to the Teen People Awards.  The Teen People Awards.  That what?  Who the hell does that?  People Magazine, right.  They let him out.  And they let him out.  Who the hell  did they let out of rehab?  Yeah, I didn't see  Suge Knight  at the Essence Awards.  Absolutely not.  Nice.  You out? 
[01:55:00]  That's all he needs  is more temptation  in his life.  Hot teens all around him.  Suge Knight,  big ups,  everybody in the lockdown,  I got you.  Yeah, they let him out  for the Teen Awards.  Wow.  Whatever.  I think he's going to have  a nice, cold Sam Adams  in his hand in no time.  No, it's funny.  Sam Adams had to pull  all their ads.  All their ads,  because it's Jim Cook,  like,  I'm hanging out here  with Ben Affleck  and Matt Damon.  And we're hammered.  Those ads stunk anyway.  Well,  they pulled him 
[01:55:30]  because he's drinking  in the ad.  A little wacky phone call  when you think of Matt Damon.  Oh, let's hear him drinking.  They don't even want us  playing him anymore,  but it's just too funny.  Hey, I'm Ben Affleck.  And I'm Matt Damon.  We're here in the studio  sitting around with Jim Cook,  brewer of Sam Adams beer  and our partner  in Project Greenlight.  Hey, guys.  Want a beer?  Sure, Jim.  Thanks.  Today we're going to show you  why we started  Project Greenlight.  I'm going to call  a big-time Hollywood producer,  but Matt and Ben  won't tell them  who they are.  Sky Reading Production.  Hi, Steve and Ron Sullivan 
[01:56:00]  from Boston Conference.  Scott, please.  I can't reach him right now.  Where can he call you back?  What happened is  I tried to get a hold  of myself personally.  He's Ben.  Security,  you know,  removed me,  but I did see him  and I waved to him  and we have a movie  that we think  would be perfect  for Ben Affleck  and Matt Damon.  Yeah, do you like  those guys as actors?  I liked them  the first time  Oh, he just slurred that.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he's  you guys as actors.  Let me tell you something.  If you are hanging out  with Jim Cook,  you're drinking beer.  Really? 
[01:56:30]  That's just the way it is.  Yeah, that guy is unbelievable.  He's the head of Boston Beer,  Sam Adams,  and he's hammered  all the time.  God bless him.  It's like my great-grandfather  used to say,  stay drunk.  And he does.  You never know  what's freshman year.  You know,  I feel really bad.  This is Ben Affleck  and Matt Damon.  No, no, no.  Sam Adams is a beer  born of the independent spirit.  Just as good as the jerky boys.  And that's why we proudly  support Project Greenlight.  Project Greenlight.  Unlocking the back gate  to Hollywood.  I'll get my toolbox, jerky.  She didn't know  she was talking to them,  but he sprung the trap, 
[01:57:00]  didn't he?  That's sharp as a whip,  that Ben.  Generation X's  William Holden,  you drunkard.  Smash your head  on a coffee table.  That was like  bloopers, blunders,  and practical jokes.  Yeah.  Only not as funny.  Well, he got her good.  All right.  Earl wants to defend  himself again.  Earl.  That's Ben Affleck.  My teeth.  They're heavy.  Earl.  Why you punch Ben Affleck?  Won't you be my  melancholy alcoholic? 
[01:57:30]  Earl.  Yes.  Are we making you laugh,  hopefully?  Earl?  Earl.  Yes.  What's up, man?  What's wrong, Earl?  How are things?  There's nothing wrong.  Earl, enough with the drama.  Your pauses.  It's like talking to  an 11-year-old girl  that's married to their mom.  Jeez, just talk to everybody.  Yeah, so what?  You got busted drunk driving.  Big deal.  It happens.  I wasn't drunk.  I know.  You got pulled over  for driving while black.  Aw.  Earl.  Did you feel like 
[01:58:00]  you were being type...  No, no, no.  What's that called?  Racial profiling.  Did you feel like  you were being racially profiled?  No, not at all.  I was driving like a lunatic  and I got caught.  He was driving like a nut.  Hey, Earl.  Yeah.  Why aren't you more excited  at the sticker stops?  We're getting some reports that...  Well, that's bad.  I'm like, great.  Because we pick places  that no one goes to.  Earl, maybe people  would come by  if they heard  that it was a little fun.  How many times  have I come to you  personally, Opie,  and said the sites  that they pick sucked?  Well, you were at, what, 
[01:58:30]  a Kmart today?  Yeah.  That's a step up  from the 99 cent story  you had last week.  The 99 cent story  that you said  went very well.  Well, let's just say  that people who go  to this particular Kmart  aren't listeners  of the show.  Earl, why is that?  It's your job, Earl,  to convert them.  Earl, everyone in this room  can relate to this, okay?  Just because there's not  a lot of O&A listeners  at these sticker stops,  these people that do go  are very excited  to meet you.  I understand that.  I'm very cordial to them. 
[01:59:00]  I don't know  what that guy's deal was.  Hey, Norton,  I'm always cordial.  Hold on.  Norton, how many times  have you had to perform  in front of like  ten people, seriously,  because it was  in the middle of the night  or something.  A lot.  You had a bad spot  at a comedy club.  What do you do?  I just plow through  and violate them, basically.  There you go.  But you work it still  because you know  these people are here  to see you.  I don't drink  and get into a van.  You don't face  the brick wall behind you  and do your jokes, right?  No, nor do I have  a few drinks  and just act melancholy.  I do my job  and I smile, damn it, 
[01:59:30]  because I'm happy.  Earl, we're hearing  that you're really  not that psyched  to be at these things.  One guy said  you were sitting  on a rail  and you wouldn't  even get up.  You hang up stickers,  you talk to people  and that's it.  Well, I heard  you were just sitting  on the rail  not even facing  where people  were coming up  and kind of just  giving a sticker out  and going,  eh, eh, here.  Sipping out of a flask.  You weren't even  like facing the crowd  at one point,  they're saying.  I was facing,  I don't know  what this guy's deal with. 
[02:00:00]  Sorry, Earl.  I don't know.  What do you want me to do?  Stop drinking and driving.  I don't drink.  Act a little happier  to be there.  I'm happy to be there.  We make the most of it.  Tell your face.  Gee, you're screaming  at everybody.  Hey, here's a guy  that was at the sticker  stop with Earl.  Anthony.  Yeah.  What's up?  Yo, I got there  about maybe 10 minutes  before he left  and he's hanging out  by the car  and I'm sitting there  waiting for him  to handle stickers.  I had to approach him  and say,  hey, Earl,  can I get some stickers?  And he was like, 
[02:00:30]  ooh, ew.  And that was it.  I was like,  what the fuck is it?  You're coming with  the ripped-in rat.  I'll bet you don't remember  that, do you,  being in a blackout?  Earl?  Yeah.  Comment?  What do you want me to say?  You should jump around  and give him a little show.  And as I said  a million times,  if you guys are not  fucking funny,  to keep showing  some pictures.  Oil them up,  put them on a block,  hand out stickers.  Earl?  And as I said  a million times before,  if you're not happy  with my performance,  find another guy.  Uh-oh,  he's quitting again? 
[02:01:00]  I didn't quit.  No,  all I'm saying is  if you're not happy,  you find another guy.  All right,  hold on.  Hold on a second,  Earl.  I just want to  calm everyone down.  Hold on,  hold on,  Earl.  What did he just say?  If we could find  another guy.  Okay.  Uh,  Old Dirty.  I'm taking the job  tomorrow.  You heard?  Old Dirty?  Yo,  what's up,  man?  You're hired.  So where are you  going to be  selling stickers?  Yo,  nah,  nah,  nah.  I'll take the van,  I'll do all the requirements  that the radio station needs 
[02:01:30]  and a little site  for more.  That van's going to be  full of contraband.  Nah,  nah,  yo,  I put mad enthusiasm  into the ONA sticker  stops.  Okay,  you crazy,  dog?  Right,  enthusiasm.  Earl?  You know what I mean?  Earl,  Yeah.  We just found someone.  Look how easy that was.  Yeah.  Okay,  no,  if you think I'm not  doing the job,  I'm going to die.  You may have to.  Why don't you be happy,  though?  Jump up and down  and throw feces.  Yo,  who's that?  You know it?  Yeah.  Yo,  you know it?  Come on,  man.  What?  ODB, 
[02:02:00]  how's my nigger?  What's my nigger?  Yo,  what's the deal,  son?  Who's that?  Yo,  Jay Moore.  What white boy  would say that to you?  All right,  Earl,  Jay,  come back to the station  and we'll work  everything out,  okay?  Yeah,  because I'm just  getting swans  for no reason.  Well,  it's not for no reason  if you're at  sticker stops  at your car  like,  you know,  smuggling Budweiser  nips  and little kids  are coming up  to you  begging you  for stickers.  We don't bring  girls,  we bring stickers.  They say,  wear the t-shirt.  We don't bring t-shirts.  You walk around  like an all-star, 
[02:02:30]  you can't,  you're too good  for everybody.  Yo,  man,  don't be a pussy,  man.  I'm not doing it,  I'm going to hand  out stickers.  Earl,  just bring your  swollen liver  back into the studio,  please.  Yeah,  cut back on the  booze in at these  sticker stops.  Earl,  I don't drink.  Earl,  Boone's Farm Strawberry.  Earl,  you're like Bobby Bonilla,  you look good in the suit,  but you've got to perform  every once in a while.  I'll be proud to kill you.  Yeah,  that's what you're right about.  I do nothing.  Man Dog 2020.  All right,  Earl,  Farm Strawberry.  Oh,  he hung up again. 
[02:03:00]  All right,  all dirty,  we've got to go.  Stephanie McMahon's on the line.  Yes.  All right,  baby.  Joey Bows.  The lovely  Stephanie McMahon Helmsley.  That's right.  There she is.  Stephanie.  I've never even spoken  to her before.  Oh,  she is the hot.  She is so hot.  Listen to all of us  just melt.  It's my lucky day.  We've been talking  about her hotness  and how hot she looks  on TV.  Nothing compared  to real life.  Stephanie.  Paul,  just statuesque.  Stephanie,  you live in Connecticut?  Yes,  I do,  maybe. 
[02:03:30]  Stephanie,  do you know Jay Moore?  I do know who he is,  but I've never met him.  Well,  why don't you come  to my apartment tonight  and we'll hang out  and we'll do some moves.  Okay,  that sounds good.  Because I wrestled  in high school  and you can show me  if my crucifix  and lariat are appropriate.  I hope you can take  triple A's.  Well,  gee,  I would hope  that you just,  you know,  get me in a takedown  position or pin me  or something.  You don't need  to do any fancy crucifix.  I'll tell you,  baby,  I'll make you sure.  What about our  huge freaking hooters,  huh?  Good question,  Cartman.  All right,  Cartman,  we'll get to it.  Stephanie,  we've been keeping tabs 
[02:04:00]  on you.  You know that.  Yeah.  And we've been watching  and didn't you say  on our show  that you would never  get breast implants?  I never say never.  Uh-huh.  I told you guys  that,  you know,  one time you asked me  what the most offensive sign  I ever saw  in the audience was  and it was that  Stephanie's puppies sag.  Oh.  Well,  they don't sag anymore.  Oh.  No,  they absolutely don't.  See,  wow,  you went to the best guy ever. 
[02:04:30]  Stephanie?  Yes.  Your big boobs scare me.  Oh,  you know,  they're not like...  They're huge.  You know,  well,  they're actually still swollen.  I just had it done.  Do you need somebody  to rub some ice on them,  Stephanie?  Come right down  to our studios.  You do?  What kind of maintenance  do you need  on a brand new  boobs?  You have to,  first of all,  you have to massage them  quite a bit.  All right.  Hold on.  Sounds a good job  for Jay Moore.  Let me rotate  the bags,  honey.  It's actually not  the greatest  kind of massage 
[02:05:00]  that you're thinking of.  You have to,  well,  at least mine anyway.  I think every ones  are different.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because I've sort of  been talking to a lot  of different women  who had them done.  Yeah.  And mine were a little  bit high,  so I have to actually  push them down.  All right.  Nice.  Hold on.  We have audio  of the guy  that's helping you  with your massages there.  Oh, really?  Uh-huh.  Take your balls  off and take it off now.  That sounded like Vince.  Wait a minute.  That was Vince.  That's not right. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, I'm sorry.  That's my dad.  That's your daddy.  Of course.  That's your daddy.  Now, you had this done  when Triple H was injured?  Actually, no.  When I first came back,  you can compare,  you know,  as I was first the owner  of BCW.  Yeah.  And then now.  I had it done  like five weeks ago.  So are you happy with him?  Yeah, I am actually.  You stand in front  of the mirror naked  and you just look  at yourself all night?  Well, I wouldn't go that far,  but when I look in the mirror,  I'm a lot happier.  Yeah?  Yeah.  But Stephanie,  no one's going to be 
[02:06:00]  looking at your beautiful eyes  anymore.  I didn't even know  she had a head.  Stephanie Mohawk or triangle?  Oh, we went over this.  We've done this before.  Well, I wasn't here  and I want to...  She played  What's in My Pants  and it turned out  she was rubbing it  on her sweater.  Yeah, I got them  pretty good, though.  No, you didn't.  It was stupid.  Oh, it wasn't stupid.  No, I'm telling you  it was stupid.  I had comedy for a living  and that was a cop-out.  That was dumb.  A wrestling girl called me.  Hey, Jay,  can I ask you a question?  Were you listening?  No.  So you didn't hear  if it was dumb or not? 
[02:06:30]  But I know a cop-out  when you're supposed  to be rubbing it  somewhere else  and you're cheating.  Well, how about  when you pull the wool  over people's eyes  and you actually, you know,  get back at them  and they're used to, you know,  getting everybody else?  How about when I make you  shake like a car on bad gas  while Triple H watches  and cranks it on the couch  like Opie?  Stephanie?  Oh, did you hear that?  You said that one sign, Mike,  was kind of offensive to you.  Have you seen any new signs?  Not yet,  but I imagine live on Thursday  at SmackDown  there will be quite a few. 
[02:07:00]  I'm sure.  Steph, I give you a lot of credit.  I was watching Raw's War last night  and when Jericho  was giving you the business  when you were in the ring.  Right.  How could you just stand there  and take it  knowing everyone  is just staring at your  huge breast implants?  Well, you know,  I had to dress the part  and wear a little more  revealing of a dress  and I just,  you know,  it's like if you're going  to go there,  you might as well go there.  Because Daddy said so.  Wear something smaller.  Stephanie,  I want big cans  in that sweater.  I'm doing your hands 
[02:07:30]  and knees  like a dog.  That's it.  Crawl around like a dog.  Okay, good.  It's freaking me out  when you throw my dad,  my dad's clothes in there.  Just cover your nipples,  that's it.  Crawl around like a dog  and for God's sake,  shake that ass.  We're going to have  a breast implant next.  Stephanie,  what size did you go up to?  Well, you know,  I actually went to where  I used to be in college  and it's just a D.  Yeah?  I'll tell you something,  they show the before  and after picture of you.  Right.  And not only the booze, 
[02:08:00]  but your arms and everything.  You're working out  pretty hard these days, huh?  Well, I'm trying,  but you know,  it takes a long time.  It's taken me about a year  to get even down  to where I am now  and I'm still not  where I want to be.  You know how you fix that?  You eat what you want,  you just puke afterwards.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, it's great.  It works good for the girls.  It sounds healthy.  Now, take your blouse off.  Come on.  Take it off now.  Take it off now.  Hey, you're not going  to do any steroids, are you?  No. 
[02:08:30]  Because I had sex  with a girl once  that did steroids.  Oh, yeah, Jay?  And when I performed on her...  Right.  I'm going to do this delicately.  Yeah.  Let's just say  the part you pay attention to  if you know  what you're doing down there...  Right.  ...was a little long.  Oh, really?  Oh, I love that.  Actually, I've heard  that as a side effect.  Wow.  Would you talk to Chyna?  No.  Hey, what's up with Chyna?  She's gone, huh?  She's got a car.  A car.  And she's doing her thing  in Hollywood.  Yeah, she decided  to go on to other things. 
[02:09:00]  There's a big market  for ugly girls  that look like Herman Munster.  Oh.  Put bolts in her neck.  We'll get her  on the family channel.  No, that's good.  Actually, I hear  she's going to do  a remake of Laverne and Shirley  with Sable,  and it's really  going to take off.  Hey, why are you guys...  Planet of the Chyna.  Why are you guys  giving Chyna the business?  The business.  No, but did it end happily,  your relationship with her?  I think for the most part.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You know,  she just really wants  to branch out 
[02:09:30]  and try other things.  You only took her man.  Oh.  Oh.  Is that true?  You know,  my personal life  is my business,  and we keep it that way.  Yeah, Opie.  That was Opie,  by the way, Stephanie.  Next time you see us together,  that was Opie.  Stephanie.  Stephanie,  this is Jay Moore.  Off the air,  can we exchange  home phone numbers  and we'll talk tonight  and just talk personal stuff?  Yeah, I already told you,  definitely.  No, you didn't already tell me.  I thought I was coming over  and you know, you were going to...  No, but you're just 
[02:10:00]  writing a check  your ass can't cash.  I know you're just  talking the talk,  but if you really want to come over,  I know you got that muscle head  that could kill me  in two seconds  for a boyfriend,  so I'd have to stab him  in the neck  the second he stepped over me.  She doesn't talk about  a person like Jay.  Cut it out.  Triple H.  It's not him  you got to worry about.  It's me.  Triple H just must be like,  I'll give you something heavy.  This is like candy  to a baby.  It just must be like,  yeah, let's go home  right after the gig tonight,  Steph.  Stephanie,  I want to take those off.  Are we talking about  the character, Stephanie,  or her personal life? 
[02:10:30]  Well, since you don't talk  about the personal life,  I'm talking about  the character.  But when the character  just go home.  I just want to give  Stephanie something heavy  to help her straighten  on her back.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Oh, there you go.  Stephanie, more controversy.  What happened with that  F-bomb that The Rock  did last night?  Well, it was actually,  I'm going to take  some of the heat for that  because I was supposed  to cut him off.  You know, it's live  and stuff happens sometimes.  I couldn't really hear him  because the crowd  was so loud  and I tried to cut him off.  Oh, boy.  But he can stop himself 
[02:11:00]  from saying the F-word.  Well...  What is he, Mexican,  that guy?  What is he for real?  He's Samoan.  He's probably just  in the flow.  Is he a guy Filipino?  No.  Samoan.  Is he a half-breed?  I think he is, actually.  I think he's half Samoan  and half African-American.  Yeah.  So what?  You were supposed to  cut him off  and he didn't know  to stop from saying  the F-word?  Well, no.  I mean, he knew  I was supposed  to cut him off  but I don't know.  You know, sometimes you get...  I haven't heard it back on TV. 
[02:11:30]  I only, you know,  was in the ring so...  Yeah.  Only enough from the live experience.  That's a lesson  to be learned, Stephanie.  A little less talk,  a little more grappling  on these live shows  I'm watching  because I got the pay-per-view  and I get them all, you know?  Right.  And I'll watch it  and I went with Opie  and everybody.  We went down to the garden  at that time  and it was like, you know,  a half hour of banter  and like, you know,  it's like Martin and Lewis.  The banter's cool though.  A little long  and I think the fans agree.  Well, sometimes I think you're right.  Sometimes it does get a little long  but we got to tell our stories  and you got to entertain  all the fans. 
[02:12:00]  And I'll tell you, Jay.  You should definitely  take your top off too  on the camera.  The pay-per-views,  they do nothing but wrestle.  The talking is done  at that point.  Yeah.  Stephanie, one more  little controversy thing  I read about WWF.  Oh boy.  The lawsuit  with the World Wildlife Federation.  Yeah, World Wildlife Fund.  The fund.  Now, they want you guys  to give up WWF  and give up your website  Yeah, they want us  to give up and abandon  the whole name.  You guys have been parallel  for the last 30 years.  Why now are they all of a sudden  wise to the lawsuit possibilities? 
[02:12:30]  50 years actually, but  WWF is 50 years old?  World Wrestling Federation, yeah.  Yeah.  But I'm just thinking like,  you know,  you say WWF,  you think  World Wrestling Federation.  Right, you don't think  Panda Bear  and World Wildlife.  Yeah, sometimes I get  the letters  because they want money.  So it's said,  I'm like,  why is Vince using  a big cuddly bear  on his logo?  That's ridiculous.  You're not your pride  in your soft back.  Take off your hide  and take it off now. 
[02:13:00]  Chew on some leaves  as I violate you.  I'm wondering  what color panties  you're wearing.  You're like,  why doesn't a panda  wear panties?  I bet you want  eucalyptus leaves now.  So, Steph.  Yeah.  The headlines  for SummerSlam.  Yes, sir.  Help us out.  Well, we've got  for the WCW Championship  The Rock versus Booker T.  Mm-hmm.  And Booker T  is of course going to win.  Yes, you say that. 
[02:13:30]  Well, you never know.  I mean,  my brother's been  pretty instrumental  in Booker T's career  thus far.  But see,  The Rock has to win  because then it's like,  you know,  him against Stone Cold  and the two leagues  and stuff.  Wow.  The Lions against the WWF.  So, The Rock will win that.  Okay.  The Lions against the WWF  and Kurt Angle  has the opportunity  to win the WWF  championship  from Stone Cold himself.  Is it true  that Shane is now  using a schlong pump  to try to pump up  his junk?  I want to know  why you're looking so hard.  Now that you've  gotten the implants. 
[02:14:00]  No?  Okay, just a rumor.  Can I ask Stephanie  a question real fast?  Yes, Jane.  Non-sex related.  Stephanie,  in this,  what is this called  that we're talking about?  SummerSlam.  Oh, of course.  The pay-per-view  this Sunday.  It's the biggest thing ever.  Huge.  I'm sorry.  Actually, it's probably  our second biggest pay-per-view.  WrestleMania.  Yeah, I'm just jet-lagged,  Stephanie.  But at one point  in a match,  will a guy be thrown  into the corner  and when the other guy  runs to cripple him,  will the other guy  stick his foot up  and get a boot in the face  or get out of the way  at the last second? 
[02:14:30]  Will that happen?  That's old school.  That is a little old school,  Jay.  I think it's been a while  since you watched  our program.  Mama, I saw it  two nights ago.  That's a Hulk Hogan movie.  No, I was in Big Dallas.  I was in Big Dallas.  Let me tell you something,  brother.  I think the question  on everybody's mind  is will the magnificent  Morocco be wrestling?  I was just thinking  about him with  the Asiatic Spike,  him and Snooker, man.  Oh, they did a number  on Snooker that day.  Remember that?  We have some  Jimmy Superfly Snooker clips.  Tell you the truth.  What, him getting  raped in jail  for manslaughter? 
[02:15:00]  This is Jimmy.  Listen.  Ouch.  That's really him.  That's actual audio.  Oh, do we have...  Stephanie, did you ever  hear us trying to get  an ID out of  Jimmy Superfly Snooker?  No, I have not.  This is classic.  I never knew that  with him.  Oh, this is great.  That's him?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  No, he was in the studio.  I always thought it was...  We had Superfly  right in your studio anymore.  I always thought it was  Ted Knight.  No, no.  That's Jimmy Superfly Snooker.  Ouch, Mary.  Ouch.  So, after the show,  you know, our guests  go into the studio  and do a little ID  for the show. 
[02:15:30]  Well, Jimmy Superfly Snooker  had a tough time.  You want to hear this, Ted?  Yes, I do.  Yeah, he had a little trouble.  Listen to this.  Don't laugh too hard.  Okay.  O.P. and Anthony  on 1-2.7.  1-0-2.  Boy, Jimmy,  too many times  off the ropes, man.  O.P. and Anthony  on 1-0-2-7.  This is a Superfly  Jimmy Snooker  and you...  Okay, let me see.  You're listening to 
[02:16:00]  O.P. and Anthony.  This is Superfly  Jimmy Snooker  and you're listening  to O.P. and Anthony  on 1-0-2-7  on W-N-E-W.  Try again,  1-0-2-7?  What the...  1-0-2...  1-0-2.7.  Yeah, what do we call  1-0-2-7?  Okay, 1-0-2-7  on W-N-E-W.  There you go. 
[02:16:30]  Did he get hurt,  Harry?  Uh, you want to...  Yeah, say anything  I hate is Jimmy  Superfly Snooker.  One more time  and I'll edit that in.  Oh, boy.  It's the Superfly  Jimmy Snooker  and you're listening  to O.P. and Anthony  on 1-0-2-7  W-N-E-W.  Superfly Jimmy Snooker  on your radio doll.  Thanks, man.  Okay, brother.  Okay, brother.  There he is,  the great Superfly.  You know, 
[02:17:00]  I broke my ankle  and my wrist  trying to imitate Superfly.  Doing the big leap  off of the corner, right?  Yeah, it was off  of my dresser, actually.  Top rope?  Right onto my face!  I thought she just  fell forward  after her breast impasse.  No, I'd bounce  right back up.  Yeah.  I wouldn't get hurt.  That's good.  What does your dad  and mom think  about your new look?  Well, they're, you know,  happy for me  if I'm happy.  That's cool.  Yeah.  So they're actually  very supportive of me.  And I'm very happy! 
[02:17:30]  They just scare me.  They're just big.  Well, they really  are still swollen,  but they're a good size.  Well, thanks for admitting it.  Yeah, Stephanie,  thanks, man.  Well, it's not like  you can really hide  from them, you know.  Well, there was  a lot of speculation,  even with you having them.  People were going,  no, yeah, no,  maybe she's just wearing  something different,  you know,  some people don't know  until you hear it.  A big push-up frog.  Yeah, something like that.  Hey, would you ever show us?  Uh, no.  Nah.  Will you ever show me?  Well, I told you  I'd never say never,  but I highly doubt it.  Yeah, but there's girls 
[02:18:00]  all the time  that they're just proud  of the work and stuff.  I'm like, oh, look,  like, it's not even  a sexual thing.  It's like, look,  check it out, man.  Fast forward to the pages  of Swank Magazine.  We dare to dream.  Steph, Playboy's  going to come a-calling now.  They are.  I doubt it.  I don't doubt it.  They would scoop you up  in a second.  Like she needs the money.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, that's true.  Oh, God.  All right.  Father wipes his rear end  with hundreds.  Yeah.  All right, Steph,  we're going to all  check out SummerSlam Sunday. 
[02:18:30]  All right, please do,  and don't miss  the live Smackdown  this Thursday as well.  Speaking of live,  when are you getting  that sweet-ass in here live?  Well, as soon as I'm invited.  You have an open invitation  to come and bring  those brand-new  huge, luscious cans  through our door.  Do I have to wear  something revealing?  That would be nice.  I don't think  you like us anymore.  I love you guys.  She's busy.  She's a big guy.  As soon as I got  the word today  that you guys  wanted to talk to me,  I said, of course,  and I called.  Ever since that whole  XFL thing,  I don't think  you'll like us anymore.  The what?  What? 
[02:19:00]  Okay, now,  I have been on your show  even live  after the whole XFL thing.  Yeah, okay.  Opie's being stupid,  right, Steph?  Yeah, he's being silly.  Opie's a jerk.  I'm just jealous  that she's now taken.  You are so taken now.  I don't see no real rain.  All right, Steph.  All right, you guys.  Thanks.  Thank you, Steph.  Take care.  Thank you.  All right.  Okay, nice talking to you.  Oh, I didn't mean to do that.  Stephanie McMahon.  You hung up on Stephanie.  She's really cool,  but I haven't heard a laugh  like that since 
[02:19:30]  an officer and a gentleman.  It's like Debra Lillard.  Sounds like Opie's laugh  when he's kidding around  with people.  It's the robust,  new, huge breast laugh.  Wow, there it is.  Confirmed by Stephanie McMahon.  I wasn't happy  we brought up  the Triple H thing.  What?  I didn't bring it up.  Anthony brought it up.  Oh, the fact that China...  No, Opie did.  Everyone's talking about it,  so I figured I'd ask.  You know, the whole thing  was a storyline at first.  Her and Triple H.  And China, we all know,  was going out with Triple H,  and then there was 
[02:20:00]  this problem.  I don't know what it is.  I don't know if it was  her or not.  What the hell?  I think it would be  more like Triple H  waking up and going,  holy crap,  I'm sleeping with a man.  Do you think if you had  missionary-style sex  with China  that you would actually  be able to blame?  Yeah.  You think you could get her  to get him open that far?  Yeah.  But she could probably flex  and just shoot you  across the room.  Why not?  No, I ain't getting  thrilled.  You can't describe  things like that  so bluntly. 
[02:20:30]  You're right.  I'm sorry, guys.  But if you're going to be  on this show,  you've got to talk  about personal...  She's waking...  Triple H was waking up  next to...  Next to...  China.  China.  And he's got  the boss's daughter  on his knee every night.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  The boss's daughter.  I think this is a very  open radio program.  Mm-hmm.  You didn't mind  talking before  about how you got caught  whacking your bag  looking at  Huggies commercials  on a loop.  I guess she doesn't  want to talk about 
[02:21:00]  China and Triple H  and any of that stuff.  All right.  We've got to take a break,  Anthony.  All right.  Who's got bigger junk,  China or Triple H?  Who's got that...  O.P.  Anthony.  Join ONA and Hooters  on 56th between Broadway  and 7th Avenue  this Thursday after the show.  Bring down any one of ONA's  recent magazine articles.  Rolling Stones.  High FHM.  New York Magazine.

[02:21:30]  Sports Guys.  Every morning.  Anthony, Sam Adams.  Who used to love  drinking Sam Adams?  Huh?  Ben Affleck.  Ben Affleck.  We just heard it before.  He loved it.  Hey, you want a beer, Ben?  Okay.  Sure.  Whatever.  Pop that cap.  But it was a Sam.  You know?  You want the good taste  of Sam Adams.  Mmm.  Great American beer.  For the great American pastime,  baseball.  Major League Baseball playoffs 
[02:22:00]  are in two months.  Two months away.  Race to the pennant.  On.  And Sam Adams.  What a great companion  at the ball field.  What a tool I sound like.  Well, you need a Sam Adams  so you can kind of, you know,  feel the copy.  Right.  That must be what it is.  Oh, well.  Trade up to Sam Adams  for all your  playoff race parties,  best buds,  better beer.  Sam Adams.  We drink it here.  It's an upgrade, man. 
[02:22:30]  Beer upgrade.  Sam Adams.  O.P. and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  What a day.  What a day.  What a day.  If you're not in the New York area  and you're trying to get a hold of us,  866-2774-WOW.  That's 866-2774-WOW.  Huzzah!  There you have it.  We got an exclusive  from Stephanie McMahon  from the WWF, Anthony.  There you go.  Admitting finally  that she got the breast implants.  Her big,  brand new, 
[02:23:00]  big pants.  Nice.  We love Stephanie McMahon.  She's a friend of the show  and a trooper.  She's getting hotter all the time.  Also, just want to remind everyone  we're in the latest issue  of New York Magazine,  the August 20th issue.  Little article on us.  The cover says  divorcing your therapist  is your shrink  holding you hostage.  Oh.  Psycho babble.  Guys, I have to apologize.  I haven't been as funny today  as normal,  but I've been doing 
[02:23:30]  that Anna Kournikova  exercise tape at home.  And I can honestly say  that I've only gotten  about four minutes in  and I am exhausted.  Maps of Hawaii,  the Cayman Islands,  the Falklands.  My apartment is a minefield.  Even the little island.  I have to dig a tiger pit  so no one walks in on me.  Right outside,  I lock the door,  I slide the hutch over,  I chain it,  and then I dig a tiger pit,  and then I do  the Anna Kournikova workout  seven and a half inches  at a time.  Just be like, 
[02:24:00]  oh, cover it with a pillow.  He doesn't care  when people watch.  Just go.  Scorch!  Hey, you guys,  what's up?  What's up, Scorch?  Let me tell you  a couple things.  First of all,  I heard you talk about  Stephanie McMahon's  breast implants.  Yeah.  If Britney Spears  ever goes on the record  and saying she doesn't  have them,  there's a doctor up here  that I know  that did them  on her.  Oh, yeah.  So she's full of it.  And Chyna.  Let me tell you  about Chyna.  You know,  I got her into wrestling.  You know that.  Yeah, you know  that whole gang, 
[02:24:30]  Triple H and Chyna.  Let me tell you.  X-Pac.  They said to me,  there's a new girl  in the locker room.  Go talk to her.  And I walked in,  and you remember  how fake puke  has like skin color  with just like  red lumps in it.  Yeah.  That's what her back  looked like.  Andrew Gulotta.  Wow.  She says to me,  I said,  I ever do steroids?  No, I've never done  a steroid in my life.  Well, we can't prove.  I've never done  a steroid in my life.  She's got that voice.  Let me tell you 
[02:25:00]  something,  Triple H.  But,  and she had hair  like Coolio.  She had like little,  Yeah, she had a face  like Sergeant Slaughter  with that jaw.  And she was God off.  They finally hacked  that thing down.  Anyhow,  I appreciate it  now that you guys  are all big and whatnot.  I appreciate you  blowing me off.  That's kind of cool.  I know.  We totally blew Scorch off.  We forgot you were  coming down from Syracuse  from the Kingdom of Nakedness.  Kingdom of Nakedness.  Totally nude radio.  But I'm going to come  back tomorrow  if you guarantee me  like I can at least  see you for a while.  Yeah, we will be here tomorrow.  We took Monday off. 
[02:25:30]  We took yesterday off.  We forgot that we told  you to come down.  What?  You didn't fly down  to New York  just to see us, did you?  I drove down to New York  you stupid ass.  Fly down.  How am I going to fly down, man?  I don't make your cash.  I make Syracuse cash.  Scorch, let me tell you something.  We wanted to hang out with you  but your hamburger,  we wanted pizza.  But I'll be there tomorrow  so definitely make sure  you're there  so at least I can say hey.  Don't let Black Girl  drive you.  And do me a favor.  Scorch, S-C-O-R-C-H  at krock.com 
[02:26:00]  or Scorch, S-C-R-C-H  420.  He does mornings at  K-Rock.  At K-Rock in Syracuse.  Although I'm on vacation this week  so if you want to email me  at my house  I'm looking for like  some hot young lady  to show me around the city  while I'm waiting  to get blown off again  by you guys.  You sound like the bus driver  on The Simpsons.  Hey, Bart, dude.  So we'll be in there  tomorrow afternoon  like at some point.  Hey, get in, Bart, dude.  It's Scorch,  the kingdom of nakedness.  Scorch, what?  What have you done  on your show lately?  Absolutely nothing, man.  My show sucks.  He just plays the tunes, right?  I didn't know my show. 
[02:26:30]  What have I done recently?  Me and Don King  are becoming pals  slowly but surely.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, me and Don King  are actually doing okay.  I've had a lot of the WWF  people on myself as well.  Yeah.  And nothing much  because like I said  at Syracuse  nothing much goes on.  I don't have to do anything  to entertain people up here.  You should rap with that voice.  You sound like an exhibit.  If you ain't effing,  get off the bus car.  I'm going to do that tomorrow.  I'm going to score a contract  rapping tomorrow  on the O&A show.  Scorch, when is the WWF  going to call you up? 
[02:27:00]  WWF, believe it or not,  they told me  that I have a chance  to do a dark match  for a light heavyweight position  at some point.  And they also told me  they're looking for writers.  So I'm interested  in perhaps writing  for them too.  So Stephanie,  if you're still listening,  I'm interested in writing  for the WWF.  I'll write totally new.  So we appreciate you  blowing us off  and we'll definitely  come back tomorrow.  Yeah, come by tomorrow, man.  Thanks, guys.  So you're driving  all the way down tomorrow again?  I'm going to drive  tomorrow morning.  I'm leaving here like...  We've got to take tomorrow off.  Yeah, we feel like  7 o'clock,  don't take tomorrow off. 
[02:27:30]  I'll be so like...  I'll feel like  you don't really love me.  No, sit in tomorrow.  We're going to have  a great show.  We're doing a WOW Summit  to Philly.  It's going to be  a lot of things going on.  I will definitely  be there tomorrow.  All right, bro.  Thanks, guys.  Hey, school.  Hey, little butt dude.  Our old pal from Boston.  Sitting in tomorrow  with us.  People in Boston  might remember Scorch.  Yeah, Scorch.  Totally nude radio.  Totally nude.  Kingdom of Nakedness.  A kingdom of Nakedness.  That guy was a wrestler  or something.  A couple of more  Dave Dickler stories  coming up tomorrow.  He works on like  the local circuit and stuff. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  He knows all those guys.  He's a really good guy.  Her back look like vomit.  Fake vomit.  That skin-colored vomit  with red chunks.  So what was the deal  when Superfly Snooker  recorded that thing?  Was he drunk  or is he retarded?  No, that's how he is now.  No, we had him in here  and we didn't get much  of an interview out of him.  He was shocked.  Okay, brother.  He was shocked.  So we're like,  what are you doing now, Jimmy?  He's like,  well, I'm doing shows  on the circuit of... 
[02:28:30]  Too many chair shots.  I'm telling you.  Things that people jump...  Like, whoa, Jimmy,  what are you even talking about?  Ouch.  Dude, he was in the front row  one night.  I'm on stage at the...  On the radio.  He's sitting there  with sunglasses on  in the comedy cellar.  I didn't know it was him  until after I had left  and he looked like  a big dead person.  Yeah.  I didn't know it was Superfly.  He probably got a picture  with him before.  We were so psyched to meet him.  I think he smoked a lot of crack  and stuff.  We were so psyched to meet him  and then there's...  We're like, oof.  Freddie Supernot Snooker. 
[02:29:00]  What?  Who?  Okay, brother.  Mike, what's going on?  Yo, Lenny.  What up?  Hey, have you seen the new...  Do you show up Maxim?  Ah.  Yes.  Jamie Lynn Sigler.  Yep.  Little Meadows.  A Jew broad.  A Jew broad.  In this day and age  on the cover of Maxim.  A Jew broad.  Pudges against Italians  on the cover of Maxim  playing in Italian.  In this day and age, Henry,  I've never been Jew broad.  I'm trying to buy this broad, Henry.  You want to help me out?  What's wrong with you, Henry? 
[02:29:30]  What type of people are these?  Get back in the car.  She's right, Henry.  What's wrong with you?  We're trying to get her  on the show.  Her brother's a fan of the show.  And she's in the city today, too.  Yeah, we're hot, man.  Where's the brother?  She got a lot of ass.  Look, she did this nice...  I like her ass.  You like that?  I like that booty.  She says she's Latin.  What do you want?  She's got a Latin body  because she's...  What is she, Cuban?  Oh, yeah, Ziegler.  Ziegler.  That's from the Livingston section 
[02:30:00]  of Cuba.  What are you talking about?  She's a Jew.  She's a straight Jew.  What are you talking about?  She's a heath.  No, she's got some Cuban blood in her.  Cuban in her?  What is that?  Let me see,  because I know.  No, I know.  She's Cuban, Greek, Romanian,  and Sephardic Jew.  That's why she's so dark.  She's got that big black bottom.  The Moors came over from Africa  years ago.  I read my history, man.  They did so much effing. 
[02:30:30]  They changed the bloodline forever.  Forever.  These are great pictures.  That's a fascinating story.  But where are my drugs?  I don't believe you, man.  That's of minor importance.  What's of major effing importance  is that I believe you.  I'm the Antichrist.  You got me in a vendetta kind of mood.  Cleveland, I'm coming at you Thursday.  You better buckle up.  They don't know where in Cleveland, though.  The improv.  The big improv, man.  God damn, that's funny. 
[02:31:00]  Look at the page on 138.  Yeah, see, that's pretty hot.  She's wearing the little gold bikini thing.  A lot of belly showing.  And she didn't do it with Stephen Dorff  like that other girl.  She was in that magazine with Stephen Dorff.  They did like a dual layout.  And she has Christopher's girlfriend.  She looks too hard lately in those photo shoots.  Yeah.  She looks smoked up, man.  You ever seen Christopher's girlfriend  in the photo shoots?  Nah, I've just seen her on the show.  Yeah, right.  On the show, she's the hottest thing on two wheels.  Yeah.  But for some reason in photo shoots, 
[02:31:30]  it's like they've been up all night  at a crystal meth gangbang.  We talked to her brother.  Can we get a...  We talked to her brother.  Jamie Lynn's brother on  and tell her how guys are just going to be  spanking their junk to her sister's picture.  Rick's trying to get her on the line right now.  Or the brother.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  She does a good job here.  I don't like it, though, Tony.  I don't like it.  I like those socks she has on, Tony.  That's good.  That's a good fashion statement she's making, Tony.  They match my striped sand gown.  I'd rather see Jackie Jr. 
[02:32:00]  being gay and all, Tony.  Jackie Jr.'s dead,  but I hope he's still warm.  I'll take him, Tony.  I don't care.  Take me to see him.  I don't know how much longer  I'm going to be here with the big casino.  I don't know if Dr. Kennedy can cure me.  Open the drawer.  I want to make sure it's him.  Hey, Earl's guy.  Can I have a moment alone with Jackie Jr.?  Oh, that's him.  I've got to say my goodbye.  Oh, that's him.  And I'm weak.  Could you flip him over?  Oh, God, he's got him.  I've got to check if he had ass cancer  like me, Tony. 
[02:32:30]  Where's Dr. Kennedy?  What's up, Rick?  Can't get the brother on.  Nah, God.  Why?  I don't know.  But you were talking to him?  Nah, I had to leave him another message.  Come on.  We're going to be cool.  His sister looks great.  I know.  I told him that.  That's where he is.  He's locked himself in the bathroom  cranking one out to her sister.  Do you do that?  If you've got a hot sister  and she's in a magazine?  If she was my sister,  I'd smack one out.  Yeah, I might.  In a dirty way.  Ugh.  I'd put cameras in her room,  take nude pictures. 
[02:33:00]  You sell those, man.  Do a slide-dive into her hamper.  I would do that.  If my sister was famous and stuff  and she was getting pictures,  I would sneak into her house  and take naked pictures of her  and sell them.  I think I really love her, actually.  Yeah.  So I'm going to lay off  in case I ever do meet her.  I can look in her eye  and tell her...  I'm always thinking.  My wife and I...  You could look in her eye  and tell her that line of crap  you tell all the other girls.  It's not crap.  That's why they like me.  They know I tell the truth, Anthony.  I love them.  I love them all.  Kiss the palm of her hand.  Make it melt.  Word.  We're trying to get Earl 
[02:33:30]  in the studio.  What's up, John?  Oh, where's Earl?  He just walked in.  He was sending a fax  down the hall.  Where?  Popeye's chicken?  As soon as he saw me,  he just gives me  the most dirty look  I've ever been given  and just says,  get away from me  and walks down to his cubicle.  Why don't you go see  if Earl wants to come on the show?  You know,  that get away from me stuff,  that's no way  to run an airline, gentlemen.  This is not how you do business  in a functionable work environment.  Get away from me.  We are not communicating.  And when the machine breaks down,  we break down, gentlemen, 
[02:34:00]  and I can't have that.  Y'all love life.  He was a water walker.  Do good or try to fight  this war with one arm  tied behind us.  Boom!  Y'all talking about death?  Y'all experts?  I'm not that.  You're about it, potheads.  We have to take a quick break.  Save your show, Elias.  We have to take a quick break.  In the meantime,  you two will cease fire.  And if I find out  there was an illegal killing,  I will court-martial your ass.  Zips in the wire.  Zips in the wire.  This is my call.  Put all your remaining  firepower within my pod.  Hell of a war. 
[02:34:30]  You guys are the best.  Classic.  Yo.  What's up, Rick?  I'm down here at Earl's desk.  All right.  And he's trying to lie to me  about some fire he's putting out,  but I see him sending  an email message  about asking for time off.  So here's Earl.  All right.  Does it smell like strawberry musk?  Earl.  What is time off  to someone  that doesn't do anything?  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  I'm going to hang up again.  Earl.  What a vagina.  Isn't he?  Wow.  The way he hangs up? 
[02:35:00]  He goes, what?  No, he's still there.  Call him Meadow.  He's just listening to us.  Are you playing  the silent game, Earl?  Yes.  Earl, talk.  You're sounding really stupid  to the listeners.  Isn't he the worst?  He's right there.  Yeah.  Earl.  Rick.  Give it back to Rick.  Rick.  He's not talking.  Hold on.  Give the phone back to Rick.  All right.  Hold on.  Rick's got this phone now.  What a slip.  Ah, Rick.  Yeah, here's Earl again.  His hand slipped, he said.  What a slip.  He's just playing for the Dodgers. 
[02:35:30]  He's so gay.  What?  Earl.  Earl.  What's wrong?  What's the matter, Earl?  There's nothing wrong.  I just got things to do.  Yeah, but when you look  at a co-worker and say,  get away from me,  that's no way to run an airline, man.  Where's your...  No, I said I have things to do.  Oh, he's lying?  He just walked in and lied  and said that Earl looked at me  and said, get away from me?  I said, get away from me.  I got things to do.  Earl.  Well, that's not constructive,  positive, or, you know,  that's wrong, man.  This is still my home.  Earl.  Earl.  I don't know why this guy  is a jump at all.  Yeah, pipe down over there.  Earl, did you get pulled over 
[02:36:00]  a second time?  No.  E-O-E-J.  Pete is saying that you got  pulled over a second time.  Oh, no.  I didn't get pulled over.  I wasn't even driving.  Don't lie.  I'm asking.  That's not a lie.  Were you drunk this time?  You weren't drunk this time?  I wasn't drunk at all.  All right.  Earl.  Earl, are we breaking up?  Earl, come down to the studio  so we can work this out.  No, I got things to do.  Like what?  Email stuff?  No, I got... 
[02:36:30]  Just stumbled out of the studio.  Oh, I hung up.  Yeah, but Rick's got another phone running.  I swear to God.  Rick.  Wow.  Yeah, break the equipment,  you ape.  Hey, Rick.  Yo, he just threw his freaking phone.  Holy crap.  Beat up, Rick.  Beat up, Rick.  Beat up, Rick.  Shut up, Jay, you dick.  No, Rick would kill Earl.  What's going on, Rick?  He just ripped the handle  off his phone  and threw it into the ceiling.  Knocking out a ceiling tile.  A ceiling tile?  I'm not paying...  That's why we don't have  nice things, Pepper.  See? 
[02:37:00]  You make fun of the movie,  but yet you laugh.  Yet you laugh,  you son of a bitch.  And now I'm standing over his desk  and he's mumbling to himself.  Oh, Lordy Lord.  He's desperate.  Do what he say.  Do what he say.  Rick, ask Earl  if he wants to talk to us.  Hey, Earl,  do you want to talk to the guys?  No.  Why not?  Ask him if he'll sing...  Hold on.  Ask him if he'll sing  Old Man River.  Earl, hold on.  He's a cursing machine  and he's heading towards  the studio, I think. 
[02:37:30]  So I'm going to try and grab him.  All right, good.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh, boy.  Batting down the hatches.  Let's see.  He's going to go ballistic  one of these days.  We all know it.  Not on me, I hope.  We all know it.  He's coming.  He's coming.  All right.  He's going to be everybody.  Or is he going the other way?  Where is he going?  Down the hall.  Watch out.  Watch out.  Where is he?  My line of sight.  John is running.  Can you see him?  Where's he going?  Hey, where are the white women at?  Where's he going?  He's at the fax machine 
[02:38:00]  with Rick.  I think Rick's trying to talk him  into coming in right now.  Why don't we take a quick break  and we'll finish this mess next,  okay?  Sounds good.  Opie Anthony.

[02:41:00]  Yeah, I was getting  and I told them  all about it  like a few months ago,  so they were all like,  yeah.  They probably will be.  They probably  dumped out of that,  brother.  Did they?  We didn't say jackin'.  I don't know what they,  they dump out of them a lot,  but yeah,  your friends will be  J.O. and dear sister.  Yeah.  Oh, Jay.  That's harsh.  Oh, come on, Norton,  don't say that.  No need.  Jim Norton's like,  Brian,  you see the picture  on page 138  with her hand  in her  little bathing suit? 
[02:41:30]  I did.  Nice, right?  That's nice, right?  Did it make you feel  dirty that you were  looking at it?  Nah, not too bad.  What does  mommy and daddy think?  Yeah, they didn't  see any,  but I saw it on Friday  and then I came by  this morning,  stopped by their house  and just dropped it  on the kitchen table  and left.  Wow.  What do you think  they're going to think?  They'll probably look  for the artistic content  in the pictures  more so than anything else.  She has nothing  to be ashamed of. 
[02:42:00]  She looks great  in these pictures.  She says in the article  that she has faith in God  and God gave her the body.  I say she's the best.  Yeah, she's doing  what she can.  Is she a good chick, man?  Is she a good girl?  She's a great girl.  Yeah, we've had her on.  She's great.  Here's a quote, Brian.  Okay.  My shirt fell down  and I wasn't wearing a bra,  so basically I gave these kids  their first shot of boobs.  Wow.  Hot, right?  I think that was  when she was like 14, though.  Yeah, even hotter.  Even hotter, Bill O'Reilly. 
[02:42:30]  Have you ever seen  your sister naked?  You know,  stepping out of the shower  or something?  When we were very young.  Yeah.  How young?  How young?  Yeah, tell us.  How young specifically?  Yeah, because Norton's here.  I don't know,  maybe like  five, six years old.  That's a little too young  for you.  You knew Norton, huh?  Yeah.  Not really, no.  Not for Norton.  Hey, Brian,  I figure my second wife  right now is in fifth grade.  Brian,  you've got to get your sister  to call us, all right?  Yeah,  that's how I was calling Rick.  I just spoke to her, 
[02:43:00]  so I probably should  give you a call tomorrow.  She's a big star now,  but she can't forget  the times we've had  on this fine radio show.  Oh, no, she won't.  Trust me, she won't.  She knows that we love her, right?  Absolutely.  All right, cool.  In more ways than one.  How fast did they get rid  of that gay guy  they hired to play her boyfriend?  That was pretty impressive.  The black guy?  Oh, yeah.  He was so gay,  I wouldn't have noticed  if he was green.  He's like,  Meadow,  we seriously have  to see other people.  Wee!  I'm dripping from my bottom. 
[02:43:30]  She's like,  you're dumping me?  Oh, well, Meadow,  I just like this thing  called a car.  A car!  Hey, Brian.  Yeah?  We think we might have  seen your sister showering.  Oh, really?  You think so?  Yeah.  Where was that?  Well, um...  Can we...  There's an apartment  sort of near us.  Don't wreck it!  Yeah.  And, um...  Yeah.  There's no windows  in her bathroom, though.  Oh, she's not one  with windows in her bathroom?  Nah, sorry to ruin 
[02:44:00]  the fantasy, though.  Yeah, because we saw  one girl showering,  and, um...  It could have been her  that had a very similar  silhouette.  Yeah.  You know, through the,  uh, glass.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Same round days.  All right.  Dare to dream.  All right, Brian,  your sister looks great  on the cover of Maxim,  and, uh, get her to call us,  okay?  I will.  All right.  See you later, boy.  Thank you, boy.  Oh!  Oh!  Earl!  Get your sister to get in here!  Earl in the studio,  uh, the last minute  of the show.  Earl?  Earl.  Wearing the sunglasses,  which means you're 
[02:44:30]  really pissed off.  Earl, did you take  the phone and throw it  through one of the ceiling tiles?  Yes.  Wow.  What's wrong, Earl?  That's pissed.  Earl, we only have a minute.  What's wrong?  What's wrong?  Are you crying?  No.  What's wrong, Earl?  You all right?  I'm fine.  You all right, right?  You want a beer?  No.  No?  Scotch?  No.  Vodka?  No.  Oh, I saw a little smile.  Take off your glass.  Jägermeister?  No.  Come on, Tony.  Jello shots?  White girl? 
[02:45:00]  No.  Tony Gwynn rookie card?  I'm going to McGuire.  We'll have a deal.  You all right, Earl?  You talk more like Tony Gwynn.  We rode you a little hard today,  but, you know.  Cousa!  Why are you wearing  the sunglasses?  I just came in.  From where?  It's going to rain outside.  It's because you're drunk  and you don't want  to see your red eyes.  Stinky, sing your song  about Earl.  Look at his eyes!  Look at his eyes!  Look at the song  about Earl and his glasses.  Earl wears sunglasses  at night.  Now do it as dice. 
[02:45:30]  Now do it as dice.  Ooh!  You know, we're going to have  to just continue for New York  because we've got to get out of here.  Yeah, we're going to have.  We're really late.  Damn it.  Thanks for having me, guys.  It was an unexpected visit  and I appreciate you making time.  Jay in Cleveland on Thursday.  Norton's going to be  at the Stress Factory eventually.  Well, where are you going, buddy?  Um, nowhere.  I have nothing to plug.  I come on.  I enjoy it.  Nice.  Tell him you're going to be  in Cleveland also.  No, the improvs don't book me.  No, listen.  We've got to go.  They're killing us.  Yeah, we've got to go.  This show turned out to be a mess
