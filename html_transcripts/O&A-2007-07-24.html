<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts proudly proclaiming their status as shock jocks and celebrating unexpectedly high ratings, particularly strong amongst men in New York and Long Island.  They attributed their success to their increasingly absurd show themes, such as "Rock Scream Tuesday," "Hummer Tuesday," and others, and jokingly considered learning Spanish to expand their audience.  They reminisced about a past confrontation with former program director John Minnelli, who had wrongly predicted their show's failure.  A significant portion involved Anthony’s Hillary Clinton impersonation, punctuated by exaggerated “acking” from Opie and E-Rock.

E-Rock then recounted witnessing a man hit his head on a car windshield, prompting morbid speculation and bets on the man's survival.  The conversation shifted to *Man vs. Wild*, debating its authenticity, and then to *Survivor Man*, with Patrice's preference noted.  This transitioned into a discussion of Macy's pulling a "Brown is the New White" t-shirt, with the hosts expressing disbelief.  They also commented on news montages focused solely on obese individuals ("fat montages").  The upcoming appearance of Corey Haim and Corey Feldman was repeatedly teased, along with Anthony's big gambling win at Mohegan Sun which earned him a private jet offer.  A caller complained about the lack of a New Jersey shout-out in their New York/Long Island thank you, and another caller mistook Opie's Greaseman impression for the real Greaseman. Opie shared an anecdote about an apple bag incident with his girlfriend.

A recurring bit featured listeners' submissions of a news reporter's laughter, overlaid onto various news clips, creating humorous and unsettling juxtapositions.  A substantial segment detailed Jared's midnight Barnes & Noble trip to spoil the new Harry Potter book for fans; the resulting interviews were played.  Finally, Corey Haim and Corey Feldman arrived in studio.

The interview with Corey Haim and Corey Feldman, promoting their A&E show "The Two Corys," was described as a chaotic and incoherent train wreck, a "clusterfuck," by the hosts afterward.  The conversation covered the show's premise,  Haim's weight loss and sobriety struggles, an anecdote about a PETA representative, Feldman's wife Susie, Haim’s past drug use and a stroke, and the inaccurate portrayal of celebrities in the media.  Feldman played a snippet of his anti-war song, “Take a Stand,” which received mixed reactions.  The attempt to record promotional IDs for the show further highlighted the chaotic nature of the interview.  Post-interview, Feldman's refusal to sign a copy of *National Lampoon's Last Resort* was noted.

The final segment focused on Lindsay Lohan's DUI arrest, with humorous reactions to the details.  The hosts speculated about her potential jail time and compared her to Paris Hilton.  Eight photos documenting the studio renovation were shown, leading to speculation about the completion date.  A significant discussion centered on a Connecticut home invasion resulting in a mother and two daughters' deaths.  The bet regarding the man hit by a car was revisited, alongside discussions on why obese girls are less likely to attend college, the high sales (and some missing pages) of the final Harry Potter book, and the FBI’s alleged ability to eavesdrop on switched-off cell phones.  Upcoming meetings and book signings were discussed, alongside a running joke about the misspelling of "wizardry."  Jimmy Norton joined Opie and Anthony in studio, with frequent interactions with E-Rock throughout the segment.

[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Our medium have to be nice.  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Shock jocks.  Go screwed.  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Shock show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Oh, it's brown.  Oh, it's brown.  Smell, smell.  Oh, yeah.  This is where entertainment is going.  Wow.  You've been stabbed once and shot twice.  No, I've been stabbed twice.  Shot twice.  Yeah.  Who's the common denominator with all these problems?  Opie and Anthony, too.  You have to lick a swamp.  Yes.  off so that bag shows through where icing was. 
[00:01:00]  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  How is everybody this morning?  Goody good.  Good, good, good.  Hi. 
[00:01:30]  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opiate Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  We especially say good morning to Long Island and New York City.  Hi.  What about Detroit?  Why, why, why?  We should say hello to Detroit.  We will.  It's going to be all about Detroit for the rest of the week and next week as we get closer  to the next ONA traveling virus comedy show.  But we need a special thank you today for New York, Long Island. 
[00:02:00]  They, uh, wow.  Came to the table.  Yeah.  Ratings came out yesterday.  And, uh, yes, we did very well.  Thank you very much.  We're trying to downplay it.  Holy crap.  We're out of our minds.  I know.  Thank God.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Man. 
[00:02:30]  Um, pretty much the best book since coming back to regular radio for us.  Yep.  Huge gains in all male demos.  Huge.  I think like a Spanish speaking station is beating us in the male demos.  Well, that's what happens here in your, uh, big, uh, cities there.  If you speak English and you're a male, you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  That's right.  And if you're bilingual, you're listening to us as well, it seems.  But if you're Spanish, wow, you got a couple of choices and you're listening to them. 
[00:03:00]  Like 80 hours a day.  I don't know how they figured that out.  It works out so nice for a station that caters to, uh, uh, a minority.  Yeah.  Which is, it's pretty big minority.  I mean, in New York city, but when you, when you have like 20 stations that cater to just  everybody, uh, they're all divvying up, uh, the listeners and, and fighting for listeners.  But then you have like three stations for every Hispanic listener. 
[00:03:30]  They're going to do huge.  They got it knocked.  We just have to get to the point where the city only has a certain amount of white  people in it.  Yeah.  That's going to happen.  Then we'll kick ass.  That's going to happen.  Ten white people.  Ten white people and only three, like predominantly white stations.  I got a better idea.  Why don't we start, uh, taking Spanish lessons?  Spanish?  Yeah.  That's what we need to do.  Speaking Spanish.  Have billboards of us dressed like Frankenstein.  And I don't know what the hell that is. 
[00:04:00]  You seen that one?  I think we need to do a little Spanglish.  Spanglish.  Where it's English, but then you throw in some Spanish.  Spanglish.  Spanglish.  But, uh, wow.  Thank you to everybody listening in New York and Long Island, especially.  The ratings were massive.  I mean, massive.  It was a very, very nice surprise yesterday after we got off the air.  Tom Chiasano skipping around his office.  Was he skipping?  Oh, he thinks, uh, he thinks, uh, this book that we just had was better than any book we  ever had at any W, which. 
[00:04:30]  He was pulling out ratings books from like 10 years ago.  Yeah.  Blowing dust off of them.  Let's look at this one.  Oh, you see?  Look at that.  All of a sudden, everyone is, uh, is friends again.  Ah, it's so nice.  Good.  All of a sudden, the phone's ringing again.  Ah.  Ah.  It's so stupid.  For the last two months, everyone's telling us what's wrong with this show, and now the  ratings come out, and, uh, we did very well, so now they're just like, they don't even 
[00:05:00]  remember having those conversations with you.  Ah, you were right all along.  It was just gonna take some time to track.  I also want to take the high road here.  Yeah.  Uh, with John Minnelli.  I wasn't even gonna mention him.  Go screw!  I wasn't even gonna mention him.  He came on this show and attempted to embarrass us after he got the boot.  Yes, he did.  When K-Rock came back here in New York City, he was, uh, the PD of the talk format that  they were doing.  Mm-hmm.  And he's convinced that, uh, we cost him another job. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  If we were performing better in mornings, he would still have a job.  No, we got him the job, but.  Well, yeah, we did get him a job, and, uh, it didn't work out for whatever reason, and  there were, there were some very talented, uh, uh, shows on the station.  Sure.  But the company, uh, couldn't wait any longer, so they went back to K-Rock, and, uh, you know,  K-Rock, uh, did, K-Rock is only in these ratings for, like, one, one out of three months,  and they did very, very well.  Yeah.  But John Minnelli's convinced that this is the end of Opie and Anthony, and after this 
[00:06:00]  book comes out, we'll be losing stations all over the country.  Because we suck.  Maybe even, maybe even lose this station here in New York City.  Yeah.  And he just beat us up as, as best he could, and, uh, we had it out on the air.  Out of nowhere.  And, you know, he said, just wait for the ratings to come out.  Well, the ratings came out, and, uh, we had our best book yet.  So, I don't know what, I don't know how John's gonna spin that one, but.  He, where, on, where, on a blog?  Probably.  He doesn't have, uh, uh, an outlet for his writing. 
[00:06:30]  So, uh, I like to think that the reason the show's doing so much better is because of the  themes.  I like to think, you know, I, uh.  That all this silliness we brought to the Opie and Anthony show is having its effect.  I mean, look at the phones.  They're already on hold to do their rock screams.  There's a guy with his car ajar.  You know.  There's a guy calling from far away.  Far away.  This couldn't possibly be it. 
[00:07:00]  I would like to think that these themes are taking off across America.  Do you honestly think something like phone call, what was it, Thursday?  Yeah, phone call Thursday.  Where people just call, well, and don't have anything.  But that's where the themes kind of started.  You had to start easy.  Phone call Thursday.  But now, you know, as we sit here today, for Tuesday, we got Rock Scream Tuesday.  Man, that's a good one.  I'll give you that.  We got Hummer Tuesday. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, that's good.  Where we encourage the ladies to, you know, to their men.  Right.  Especially if they're fans of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sure.  We got far away phone call Tuesday.  All right.  That, we're starting to get silly.  Not really.  But it's interesting to take far away phone calls, not phone calls from, like, Newark.  Well, it has to be overseas.  Well, people try to call for far away phone call, and they're not far away.  Wow.  And that's silly.  We're good at figuring it all out.  I want to hear people with strange, far away accents. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  People listening on the internet.  Yep.  Your door is ajar Tuesday.  All right.  Now, you're completely ridiculous.  Well, this one might be dropped after today.  It's barely hanging in there.  Yesterday, we had to drop a few themes.  Today, we might have to drop your door is ajar Tuesday.  That's where someone calls in, and you just hear their car door open because it's going  boom, boom, boom, boom, as they make their phone call.  It's ridiculous. 
[00:08:30]  I was on Kid Chris when he was doing a New York show, and someone called in to say hello,  Norton, or whatever, and you could hear the door being ajar in the background.  I was like, what's that noise?  He's like, boom.  My door's ajar.  Ajar.  It's just ridiculous.  This is the silliness that's bringing in the people.  I'm telling you, guys.  Is it?  And then, of course, last week, good old Anthony came up with Diabolical Laugh Tuesday.  Diabolical Laugh Tuesday.  Which I'm not happy with because you already got Rock Scream Tuesday. 
[00:09:00]  Rock Scream Tuesday.  You know, I think...  Should Diabolical Laugh be moved to Thursday?  Well, Thursday's pretty full.  Pretty full?  What about Wednesday?  Wednesday is...  Whip them out Wednesday.  Wednesday's Whip them out Wednesday, which is a great one.  I don't know.  We'll have to figure it out.  Maybe we can move it to tomorrow.  I'm willing to suspend Diabolical Laugh Tuesday.  But this is only the second week of Diabolical Laugh Tuesday.  We need it today.  And then we can figure out what to do with it next week.  All right.  Well, let's see how our Rock Screams go. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah?  And if they don't go well, then we'll bring on some Diabolical Laughes.  Maybe that's what we do.  Maybe we rest Rock Scream Tuesday a little bit and do more Diabolical Laughes.  I don't know.  Rock Scream is so huge.  Rock Scream is very popular.  People just love doing their Rock Scream.  Is this really the show people are listening to right now?  Has Hillary had work done?  Huh?  Has Hillary had work done?  Oh, obviously.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah.  She got tightened up a little bit.  By David Cassidy's barber.  Stupid frosted mullet. 
[00:10:00]  Frosted mullet.  She's hard.  Did anyone watch this crap last night?  It's way too early to listen to the candidates.  I know.  And they had a YouTube.  But I heard they didn't really use the YouTube angle.  No, because they said so many people were just goofing.  It's stupid internet.  It's YouTube.  What do they expect?  People think...  These people are so out of touch.  They actually believed that they could get people on the internet to ask reasonable, logical,  intelligent questions to the candidates. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  And not just go, dude, you're a faggot.  Or something like that.  Or calling her a dyke.  Or Jimmy saying she's got a lesbian frosted hairdo.  A mullet.  I mean, that's what they're getting.  90% of the stuff that came in.  They said they really had to screen them.  And a lot of the questions were suspiciously identical to the reporters.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You know they set that up nicely.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:11:00]  I don't want you to think that you're at home.  I was reading they're trying to get a reality show angle into this whole thing.  And it's just not happening.  Excuse me.  It's the election of a president of the United States.  Can we not make a reality show out of it?  Well, they're trying to be more hip and more in touch with what's going on in society.  Remember when Bill Clinton went on MTV?  Yeah.  How revolutionary that was.  And played the saxophone on Arsenio.  Sure.  That's what they're going for.  That's what they're going for. 
[00:11:30]  That type of let's bring something different and new into this thing.  Let's make humans of these candidates.  And they just can't do it because the candidates aren't human.  Hillary Clinton is one of the most robotic, zero personality people I've ever seen.  Not even running for president.  Just I've ever seen.  She cannot be sincere about anything she says with a voice that talk.  She sounds like a robot. 
[00:12:00]  She's horrid.  But it always starts off nice.  Could she just be sincere once and actually.  Do a health care.  I'm going to throw some scenarios at you as Hillary.  As Hillary?  Here she is.  Do a health care for everybody.  This country needs universal health care.  There are people that cannot afford to take care of their families.  And we need to implement. 
[00:12:30]  Jimmy, you got one for Anthony doing Hillary?  I was wondering if there was.  Some of the issues of the day?  Yeah, a lot of African-Americans are facing some tough issues.  Maybe you'd speak to a congregation of African-Americans and discuss some of the issues facing them for the day.  I believe the African-American community needs help in getting together, leadership, and helping the young get through school. 
[00:13:00]  Do you know the dropout rate in high school for African-Americans?  Anthony has Hillary.  The war in Iraq.  What's going on?  What are you going to do with that whole mess?  This has become a quagmire that the Bush administration has not realized.  We need to bring the boys back as quickly. 
[00:13:30]  Jimmy, one more.  Um, oh, I don't know.  What about the youth?  I mean, the shock jockery and things of that look are hurting the youth.  The children are our most important resource in this country.  It takes a village.  It takes a village.  We all need to take responsibility for the children in this country.  Hey, E-Rock. 
[00:14:00]  What the F, man?  Where's your Ack?  Ack.  Oh, God.  She's just a robot.  Or she's an alien with green jello in her head.  Who, if you play Slim Whitman music, her head will explode.  Do you have that drop of her talking in that church?  Oh, where she started talking a little jive? 
[00:14:30]  She went Southern?  I'm just a Southern gal.  Are you?  Are you?  Are you?  Oh.  I don't know.  I don't know how the Democrats are going to figure this one out.  She is the most insincere.  She is the most insincere.  I would love to see her for once just get on stage, speak like a human from the heart,  and just actually speak to people instead of having this pre-written speech that just comes off with that tone of voice. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, just like an automaton.  We got her doing a little Southern stuff.  Here she is in front of a bunch of black people.  Yeah, here we go.  She's got to be black.  I don't feel no ways tired.  I come too far from where I started from.  Nobody told me that the road would be easy.  I don't believe he brought me this far to leave me. 
[00:15:30]  Did that come?  Maybe she's trying to show people, look, I haven't forgotten my roots,  and then she decided to put on the dialect to prove to people that she could still talk in her dialect.  Did you hear the way it came off?  It wasn't even like this down-home kind of honest speaking.  It was, don't leave me.  It was a performance.  Who's voting for this mess?  This dishonest jackass who can't even keep tabs on her hubby. 
[00:16:00]  A lead belly.  Maybe one more.  I thought this was getting a little obnoxious, but Anthony has Hillary.  They're even calling it Anthony has Hillary.  Gay marriage, Anthony has Hillary.  You know, I don't understand why in this country people that fall in love have to be divided up by sexes.  And I believe gay couples should have the same opportunity that the married couples have as far as... 
[00:16:30]  Excuse me.  Ack, ack.  A rock.  Ack, ack, ack.  Why aren't you ackin'?  Ack, ack, ack, ack.  See, our part in the brilliant Anthony bit is to be like the audience approving what she's saying and we're ackin' instead of applausing or cheering.  Ack, ack, ack.  Because she's the ack leader and we're just the, you know, the ack audience. 
[00:17:00]  So let's try it again.  Do we have one more?  One more important issue this election?  Oh, gun control.  Gun control.  Anthony has Hillary.  Anthony has Hillary.  I want to hear you loud, E-Rock.  To immediately reinstate the assault weapons ban in this country.  Gunfire is destroying our nation and killing the youth of this country.  We need the gun lobby to understand the ack, ack, ack, ack, ack. 
[00:17:30]  Ack, ack, ack, ack, ack, ack, ack, ack, ack, ack, ack, ack, ack, ack, ack, ack, ack, ack, ack, ack, ack, ack, ack.  What a mess.  I can to hear him do it.  Alright.  Jesus, thanks for wrecking the bid, E-Rock.  Oh, okay.  It's safe.  Jack, ack, ack.  Here it comes. 
[00:18:00]  It's Rock Scream Tuesday.  Rock Scream.  And Anthony.  See?  Damn.  Silliness, much better for this radio show.  Those Rock Screams rule. 
[00:18:30]  We're taking lots of phone calls from Long Island, New York in general, and of course Jersey today.  Let's say hi to Billy on Long Island.  Billy, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Billy.  Want to do a nice early morning Rock Scream for you.  All right, what's up with your phone, man?  Vibrator on?  Hold on, let me see.  Yeah, you got it like a little.  Is that any better?  No?  No.  It got worse.  It got worse.  Your phone stinks.  It's going...  All right, give it a try. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, man.  Can you hear me any better?  No, just give it a try.  We can kind of hear you.  All right.  Wow, early morning Rock Scream.  I like it.  Let's say hi to Mike in Jersey.  Mike, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  What's up, Mike?  Hey, damn Mike.  Rock Scream Tuesday.  All right.  Ready?  Yeah.  Ready.  Ready.  That wasn't a Rock Scream. 
[00:19:30]  Certainly wasn't.  And you had the potential, sir.  Yeah.  He could have done it.  Did I say applauding?  Applauding, whatever.  Uh-oh.  Let's say hi to J.D. in Boston.  J.D., what's up?  I'd like to do my Rock Scream, guys.  Do you want to mind?  All righty.  All right.  Here I go.  Wow. 
[00:20:00]  Hey, that was a pretty good Rock Scream.  Thank you very much.  That's from a lot of 80s metal, as I do like to say.  Wow.  That was really high.  80s metal rules.  Thanks, J.D.  Okay.  Hey, a lot of people on SFVBAC are doing the act, act, act.  They're now typing it out.  Jimmy from Long Island.  I hate her.  I hate her face.  And I hate her stupid voice.  Act, act, act, act, act, act, act. 
[00:20:30]  She's the worst.  We're just warming up.  We got lots to do today.  That's for sure.  I hear.  I got an email late last night, just before I was going to bed, that E-Rock may have witnessed  someone's death last night.  Ooh.  Someone's death last night.  E-Rock, are you okay?  Maybe that's why he couldn't put his all behind the whole act, act, act thing.  Is it haunting you, whatever it was?  Eh, it's a...  Yeah, I see.  Oh, my God.  I just stay there.  He's all screwed up. 
[00:21:00]  He's got, like, post-traumatic stress disorder.  Yeah.  Teasing is...  Or something.  Teasing is...  Retarded people.  Teasing is also good for radio shows.  So, after the break, E-Rock's story about seeing someone die last night.  I mean, where are they going?  Where are they going?  Really?  Nowhere.  Come on, stop.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Good morning.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show?  And we greatly appreciate it. 
[00:21:30]  Don't forget, we changed the phone number to make it easier for you guys.  All right.  Give out the easy phone number.  Because we're a very, very interactive radio show.  So, we got a link on our website where you can instant feedback the show.  Instantly, obviously.  Yeah.  We got the PalTalk cameras all over the studio.  Let's not forget about that.  So, you could actually watch us through the radio show.  And, of course, the phone number is 877-212-ONDA.  O-N-D-A. 
[00:22:00]  O-A-N-D-A.  Right.  That's it.  Very easy.  Very easy to remember.  Very easy to dial.  Also, go to 923krock.com.  Go to the Opie and Anthony page.  Al, who does the dumping for the radio show to keep it safe and keep us from getting fired.  Yeah.  Now, we sometimes don't agree with him.  But, in general, he's looking out for us.  He does a show rundown that's really, really good.  And what's different about his show rundown, he actually has all sorts of links. 
[00:22:30]  So, if we're talking about a particular video or maybe something that's happening locally on the news here in New York,  he links it right on that page so you could check out the video for yourself or whatnot.  Yes.  He's an idiot savant.  And, you know, he's got a little humor behind it as well.  Yeah.  Speaking of pal talk, quickly, last night I was in the Opie and Anthony fan room at about, I don't know,  it had to be about 730 or so last night.  And just chit-chatting, having some fun with the listeners. 
[00:23:00]  And then they all were like, oh, my God, go to this camera, go to this camera.  So, I go there and it is this guy, I guess a little on the heavy side, but not by any means fat,  having sex on the couch with a pig.  Just this big, fat woman wearing a top.  She wouldn't take her top off.  And black socks. 
[00:23:30]  It was just some camera, one of the cameras in our room.  And it wasn't a tape, it was live.  And they're fans of the show, or?  I have no idea.  They were just.  They were in one of our rooms.  They were in one of our rooms, because like you said, it's a community that just keeps going after the show.  And there's, you know, well over 100, 200 people sometimes that just gather at night,  pop in these rooms on pal talk, and I pop in there and we have a pisser.  We laugh, goof on each other and everything.  And they just started having sex on the couch. 
[00:24:00]  And this guy, we were making so much fun of him.  The jokes were flying.  All the fat pig jokes.  And they just kept going.  This guy was a trooper.  A trooper.  And at first, right when I went to the camera, because he was like, he was, they were both really pale, white.  And he didn't have a hair on him.  And this big hulking mess is laying on the couch.  I swore.  I thought the girl was on top. 
[00:24:30]  I thought.  And it was the guy.  And I thought the guy was the fat chick, because she looked like a man.  She wouldn't take her glasses off.  And they were joking, because she wouldn't move.  She was laying on her back.  She had her hands kind of behind her head almost, above her head a little bit, grabbing onto a pillow of the couch.  And her knees pointing at the ceiling.  And that was it.  She wouldn't move.  And then, like, she moved her hand once and kind of rubbed her face.  And all the jokes started pouring in that she found a chip in the couch and started eating. 
[00:25:00]  And how long can the guy last?  I don't know.  But she can't go much longer without a sandwich.  Like, just pounding her.  It's so much fun, even after the show, to just pop on there and goof with everybody.  Because usually something's happening in the room that just makes it a blast.  And that was it last night.  Just disgusting, pigging sex.  Yeah, I mean, the radio show, we do, you know, like five hours a day.  And then the whole thing continues after we go off the air every day. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  Every day.  Whether it's fan sites or the pal talk rooms.  You can pop into the Opie and Anthony fan room after the show's over at any time on pal talk.  And it is the top, like, room in the conversation section.  It's just the top room.  There's more people there than anywhere else by far.  That's hanging out.  Very, very cool.  Hey, what's the number here?  The new number?  The phones are lit, so it's pretty easy to remember.  Yeah, finally, we got a number that people can remember.  877-212-ON-A. 
[00:26:00]  And I'm over-pronouncing end on purpose because a lot of people call us O-N-A.  With an N, right.  That would be different.  O-A-N-D-A.  Yes, exactly.  Well, let's get the official promo out of the way here.  Diabolical Laugh Tuesday. 
[00:26:30]  On the Opie and Anthony show.  Wow, that was diabolical.  Themes making the Opie and Anthony show more gooder.  Let's say hi to Dennis in Boston.  Dennis, what's up?  Hey, I want to do a diabolical laugh.  All right, let's hear it. 
[00:27:00]  Is that diabolical or maniacal?  That was maniacal.  I think that's maniacal.  And we'd have to do a maniacal laugh Monday.  Yeah, and Anthony set the rules for Diabolical Laugh Tuesday.  It's got to be three.  At least three.  It has to be at least four.  But at least three with a slow build.  Let's try another one here.  That was very good for maniacal.  Let's say hi to Mike listening on WYSB in Philadelphia.  What's up, Mike?  What's happening now and I? 
[00:27:30]  Hey, Mike.  Hey, Mike.  I wanted to actually do a diabolical laugh for Diabolical Laugh Tuesday.  And I also wanted to see if you guys wanted to maybe do a stoner spelling bee.  Go old school.  Yeah, we should do that, man.  We're bringing back stoner spelling bee in the very near future.  We just got to prepare a little better for it.  Can I ask you something, Mike?  What's that?  You know anybody that listens to Preston and Steve?  Yeah, and they stink. 
[00:28:00]  Now, have they ever come up to you and said, oh, this is what they did today?  And have you ever, like, laughed?  No.  Like, you can't go up to any Preston and Steve fan and say, what happened on the Preston and Steve show today?  Because it's just a bunch of nonsense.  It's a stupid show.  Their show is very good.  The only reason they're beating you guys in Philly is because of the local, like, they go out to the local bars and stuff. 
[00:28:30]  You know what I mean?  The local bars.  Is that easy?  I know a lot of people in Philly.  Dude, we're a New York-based show and we don't go out to local establishments.  You know, it should be whatever.  You should listen just because what you're hearing on the radio is fun and interesting and funny.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't even know because I've listened to them a couple times.  I can't even stomach.  Do you question any of them about that stupid marble gag that just bombed where they dumped the marble down the rocky stairs and it did nothing? 
[00:29:00]  Something like that, you should point and laugh.  Huh?  Just point and laugh.  Yeah, we'll get them.  We'll get them.  Yeah.  We got a lot of confidence yesterday here in New York.  Well, I have faith in the people of Philadelphia that they cannot possibly find that entertaining.  There's some kind of fluke that happened that they felt compelled to listen for some reason 
[00:29:30]  and they have to realize that there's nothing going on there.  I got a really good theory.  What?  They turned up the power on their transmitter, which is highly illegal.  Well, one thing I did notice.  They got people meters, which actually pick up a signal now.  Yep.  And I think they raised the power of their transmitter.  One thing I did notice when we were in Philly.  I'm on to you, effers.  I was trying to tune in YSP and through like five stations, all you could hear was them. 
[00:30:00]  They were like covering half the spectrum.  I think you better check out the power that's coming out of that place.  Oh, we're on to you.  Yeah.  Let's go to Jersey.  Mike, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  I got a diabolical laugh for you.  Are you the same guy that did the rock scream with the bad phone?  Come on.  Don't make us start bad phone Tuesday, you know.  No, not bad phone.  Wait, he's already starting his laugh. 
[00:30:30]  What is he doing?  Hold on.  Let's go to John in Jersey.  John, what's up?  What's going on?  Hey, man.  What do you got?  Diabolical laugh.  Ready to go?  All right.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  All right, you're right.  That is not a diabolical laugh.  See, we got to screen the calls better there, Travis.  People are being, you know what else?  They're being hacks.  Yeah. 
[00:31:00]  Like, you can't be a hack.  We understand.  Do you understand that like five or eight people already have done the cat thing and that it's  old when you're trying to do a diabolical laugh?  It just doesn't like, it's been done already.  The first guy that does it, okay, we get it.  If you're going to do it eight times, it's not even like funny because it's been done so  many times.  It's hack at this point.  It's hack.  All right, let's move on to the email I got from E-Rock last night. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, here it is.  I hope he's all right.  E-Rock looks very sad.  He saw a horrific sight last night.  Haunting your nightmares, E-Rock.  Were you naked and did you confront a mirror?  Let me, uh...  Could you not eat for minutes?  He's in no mood today.  And I could tell that he was shook up because he sends me this email and the subject says  accident.  A-C-C-I-D-N-E-T.  A-C-C-I-D-N-E-T.  It was an accident? 
[00:32:00]  Accident.  And why would you...  Wait, wait, wait.  Is that the only thing in the subject line?  Yeah.  You're a dick.  Why?  You know something?  Listen, I can't stand people that do this on message boards or on emails.  Don't put something like accident in the subject line because then you get people freaking  out until they open the email.  Now, when you saw that, did you think that perhaps he was in an accident or that somebody  you know was in an accident?  Why would you do that?  Why not saw accident or have info on accident or witnessed accident? 
[00:32:30]  You can't just write accident.  People don't think about subject lines in emails or message board things.  Or you start with, I'm okay.  Something that just kind of diffuses the situation.  I see the one sometimes where I pop up and it's like, Jim Norton dead.  And it's like, oh, that's nice.  Let me open it up.  And it was the football player.  I know.  I was as bummed as you were. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  But for the second, you're looking going, oh, Jesus Christ.  What the, you know, you're freaking out.  Would you be sad if I died?  I would be devastated.  Thank you.  Don't, don't die, Jimmy.  Hope not.  Yeah, there was, there was a thread, something like, uh, like Bill Burr killed.  Like, yeah, yeah.  Bill Burr killed in DC or something.  And it was like, oh, he killed in DC.  Yeah.  It's like, you're just a bunch of asses.  Well, this is the email from E-Rock last night.  It says, Axid, Axidnet. 
[00:33:30]  Axidnet.  Axidnet.  Uh, Angie and I were coming home from dinner at 1849.  A fine sponsor of this very radio show.  How was the food?  Very good.  Yeah?  Where is it?  It's, uh, it's actually around the corner from the Comedy Cellar on, uh, on Bleaker.  Oh, Jimmy, you gotta go down there after one of your sets.  I'll go down there tonight and try to get a free meal out of them.  Yeah, nice.  Jimmy will be there tonight, uh, before his cellar gig.  Did you have the wings?  Yes, we did.  Oh, they're good, huh?  Very spicy.  Yeah.  Did you have to make when you were done? 
[00:34:00]  I'll bet you he was stuck in 1849.  It was actually 1841 when he started.  But his little pants were around his fat calves.  Honey, are you all right in there?  Sweat's all wet.  Stupid hat.  He's waving, fanning himself with his hat.  Oh, those wings could do damage, man.  Oh, 12.  Oh, they're way out.  They could do damage, man.  12 wings.  He's just crying.  He's got little pads in his pocket.  Those little medicated pads.  My bottom is sore.  My bottom.  I have to burn. 
[00:34:30]  My bottom.  I drink some water.  Too bad he doesn't have any of that wizardry.  That's right.  Too bad you can't cure yourself with a little bit of wizardry.  Oh, boy.  Harry Potter can come in there and go ta-da and make your bottom feel good with his wizardry.  Dumpy-a-saurus.  That's your name.  In the Harry Potter series. 
[00:35:00]  That made me laugh all day yesterday.  I was walking around the house after my nap.  Wizardry.  Wizardry.  It's just so much fun to say, Jimmy.  I tried to bring that to my girlfriend in the elevator.  She just didn't want to hear it.  Didn't get it.  Didn't mean anything to her.  There was so many times when she was cleaning out that I was kind of emasculating.  You're trying to explain what happened on the radio show to people in your real life.  In the translation, something is lost, and you're like, well, never mind. 
[00:35:30]  Hey, you want to go get a bite?  I'll tell you what's lost.  The humor and interest in the party.  All I said was, I opened my mouth and words just tumbled out in the elevator.  I could have just opened my mouth and said, 5-2 Tuesday poster window.  That would have had the same effect as wizardry.  Wizardry.  Angie and I were coming home from dinner at 1849, and it was a fine dinner.  I thought he was using military time to tell when he was coming home.  It was 1849 hours.  11 minutes before the hour of 7. 
[00:36:00]  We're at the corner of 42nd and 9th Avenue.  Jimmy's old neighborhood.  Yes, I was 43rd and 10th.  What were you doing there?  Were you going into that peep booth I suggested?  I was standing there with my drill.  I had no outlet.  I couldn't find a buddy.  It's an accident in some gentleman's pants.  I couldn't believe it.  And me without a squeegee.  But luckily, I had my word. 
[00:36:30]  An accident.  Accident.  Okay, so we're at the corner of 42nd and 9th, and we just saw this guy jump out in front  of a car, went face first into the windshield of a mini SUV, then flew into the intersection  when the car hit its brakes, loading him into an ambulance and covering him with a blanket.  Wait, wait, wait.  And covering his face?  Well, that's the part we didn't get to see, because they were pulling the sheet up as they're 
[00:37:00]  lifting the gurney to the ambulance.  Yeah.  So we never saw if the sheet went all the way over his head, but it went up half his body.  Well, this happened on 42nd and 9th.  Yeah.  So why don't we do some investigating and find out?  You can find out the guy was killed.  Yes, of course you can.  Did he have horrific dreams last night?  Uh, I didn't sleep last night, but...  Why?  I don't know.  I was just, like, very tense.  Well, let me tell you something.  If he was dead in the street, they would have left him there and done all their investigation.  So obviously there was some kind of life left in him where they loaded him into the ambulance. 
[00:37:30]  Perhaps he died later.  Perhaps he's fine.  But if he was just dead right there in the street, they wouldn't have taken him away.  Well, the cops, um...  It would have been a manslaughter investigation.  The cops cleared everybody away, uh, was directing traffic around 42nd there.  They'll do that for a flat tire.  Yeah, no kidding.  Flares, clear everyone away.  And, uh...  Not for ready.  He was laying there for about 5-10 minutes before an ambulance finally showed up and... 
[00:38:00]  Bambulance.  Didn't some lady poke at him or something?  Oh, yeah.  When the first cop showed up, there was a lady in a black sports bra.  Um, there was a couple people crowded around this guy.  I seen him.  He's all right.  She's poking him with her umbrella.  That's good.  I know first aid.  Right.  Poke, poke, poke to see if he's moving?  Yeah.  Come on.  Oh, that's creepy.  The cop gets out of the car.  He's asking a bunch of people there what happened.  And the lady is still just kind of nudging him with his umbrella. 
[00:38:30]  Uh, with her umbrella.  That's wonderful.  Thanks, you dummy.  The guy who jumped out.  You mean, he didn't jump, like, physically trying to kill himself.  He just walked out and didn't see it.  Well, that's, that, it looked like he did it on, on purpose.  Um, from, from what I was hearing from a bunch of the people there after the, the event  happened, a lot of people saw him walking back and forth in and out of traffic and just  hanging around that area for a while.  Oh, wow.  And then while the, the traffic was coming in that direction, he kind of just walked  out and went face first right into the car. 
[00:39:00]  Description of the gentleman, uh, Ira?  Um, a bald black gentleman.  Yes.  Um.  Was he kind of homeless?  Was he acting crazy?  Ball, fat?  Did he have a Ron and Face shirt on and a producer resume?  Uh, a little bit of weight to him.  Not very fat.  Uh, didn't get a look at his face.  Did you look at the, uh, the vehicle that hit him?  How bad was that, uh, screwed up?  Um, when you look at his face, you had a chance to see dead eyes.  Yeah.  Dead eyes are cool. 
[00:39:30]  Glazed over.  They're frozen in time  The eyes are frozen in time  About a quarter of the windshield  Was just perfectly shattered  Like in a circle for where his face hit it  Oh nice  Then it shattered in a different direction  After the circle went in another  In a different design  I'm saying he's alive  I'm gonna go with dead  How do we find out?  I'll bet  Of course you will  Let's bet  Of course you will 
[00:40:00]  I bet $25  I'm in  I'm in  But I don't do the action you do  I'm in  I'm good for like $10, $20  $10, $20  You play $1,000 blackjack hands  $6,000  Well a couple were up to $16,000 hands  If you didn't listen yesterday  We told everybody that Anthony won  $100,000 at Mohegan Sun  On Friday night before the comedy show  Up there in the Boston area  That brings his winnings to date

Holy Jesus  This is the worst  It's ever been  Did they ever start  This early?

[00:45:30]  And then  They're not sure  And they set up committees  And this  And you know they're going to run  They're just waiting  For these early people  Like Hillary and Obama  To run out of steam  And then they jump in  As the fresh new guy  Law and order guy  Is going to be our next president  Oh shut up  Law and order guy  You want to bet?

He's the actor  Fred Thompson  Fred Thompson  Oh I'm sorry  When you said law and order guy  I thought you meant  A guy who's all for law and order guy  Oh no no  Not reality  I'm talking fake things 
[00:46:30]  Yeah  Like TV shows  Things that people can really  Sink their teeth into  Fakeness  Yeah  Yeah  Law and order guy  He'll get up there  He'll decide to run  Everybody else will be like  Old hat  There's Rudy right now  Look at Rudy  Rudy doesn't look  Presidential enough  He's got a big  Beluga whale  Sonar head  He's had  The prostate  Although didn't  Law and order guy  He looks like a cartoon  That should be like  A lymphoma 
[00:47:00]  Like he should be  Trying to rule the world  Yeah  I'm gonna rule the world  He does look like  Simon Barr sinister  Yeah  With my weather machine  I'll destroy the world  That's what Rudy looks like  People might not want to vote for him  And he's Italian  So people  You know  Think that he's mobbed up  Or something  He's probably got some skeletons  In his closet  His marital record  Is not that hot  His abortion  And Republican thing  Doesn't jibe  With the party line  So that's gonna take 
[00:47:30]  Votes away from him  It's just  He has a better shot  Than TV guy  TV guy  TV guy  Is TV guy  You know what  TV guy looks really old  Have you looked at him lately  It doesn't matter  Reagan was old TV guy  But he didn't look that old  He looked like he was together  Ladies and gentlemen  Hold on  What happened  What happened  Ladies and gentlemen  I give you our next president  Of the United States  Law and order guy  Starring as the president 
[00:48:00]  The president  This is weird  Is he still gonna do TV?  No  I think you're looking at  John Edwards right there  Nope  He's gonna get the Democrat  Democrat nomination  Oh  Democrat  I don't care about the Democrats  And Edwards is gonna come out of nowhere  And go past Hillary  And Obama  Democrat  But he's gonna take Obama  On the ticket for some reason  And that's gonna get  That's gonna make it a little crazy  Democrats are the goofy 
[00:48:30]  Party  This time around  They're gonna blow it again  In an election that's coming up  That the Democrats should be able  To just take  Walk away with  After  How the Republicans  Have screwed up  And how Bush  Is  Popularity  Is way down  They should be able to  Get a candidate in there  And walk away  But they're going with  Goofy candidates  And by goofy  Don't take me wrong  This country is not ready  For a woman president  Or a black president  It's just the way it is  Chocolate 
[00:49:00]  Green  Chocolate  Green  Sorry  Vote for a white man again  Again  Chocolate  Green  I think you're wrong  I think you're wrong  About a Republican  Though  Middle America  Has too much disdain  Chocolate  Rain  It just isn't gonna work  You live in New York City  You're  Like  A little more free thinking  You're an artist  You know  L.A.  Same thing  All that  Five hours  That you fly over  To get from point A 
[00:49:30]  To point B  The people that might vote  Woman or black  Five hours of flying  That's the people  That won't vote  Black or woman  Chocolate  Green  Nope  I think Rudy has a shot  And I think the fact  That he's divorced  Is gonna help  I don't think  He's a divorced president  Yeah  People will relate to that  He's a Republican  People will relate to  He has an imperfect life  He's pro-choice  He's not some complete  Religious conservative  I'm telling you  Pro-choice will hurt him though 
[00:50:00]  As far as Republicans go  Maybe  But again  I think  You know  And I don't think  If they're getting so beat up  With Bush  They'll be happy to have  Anybody who gets that far  If he was moderate enough  Where  His pro-choice stance  Would get him  Democratic votes  Crossover votes  From the Democrats  That might compensate  For what he's losing  In the Republicans  That might work for him  But  Democrats can't stand him  But  They're not gonna vote  For Rudy  TV guy  Yeah but  Supposedly TV guy  Has some skeletons  In the closet 
[00:50:30]  Like what  I don't know  But he's been on TV  People love the show  Oh speaking of TV guys  TV guy  One we had in  Turns out to be  And if I may  A phony  Oh I know  I thought you were gonna say  Something else  With an F  Oh no  A fraud  No  A fool  No  A fruit  Well it's coming out today  Okay  We like this guy  Bear Gill  Or Gil Bear  What's his name there  Just  Douche  Bear Gorillas  Right  Douche  Douche in a khaki shirt  He was a nice guy 
[00:51:00]  We had him right on the couch  Of course he was  He was well rested  In a hotel  Bear Grylls  Yes of course  He is the star  Of Man vs. Wild  And now they're saying  That the show  Is very very fake  That like  You know  He gives the  The illusion  That he's out in the woods  In the middle of the night  There  And actually  He's in  He's in  Really nice  Hotels  With internet connections  Yeah it seems  They film all that stuff  They film it  And he's crawling around  In the mud  And then  They cut  And then they all 
[00:51:30]  Take a vehicle  Back to a hotel  What he admitted  On our show  Was that the crew  Goes back to a fancy hotel  And he stays out there  At night  And then the crew  Comes back  In the morning  And then they move on  With their little adventure  But who believed that  Like alright  Take care crew  Indoor toilets  Be good  I saw five minutes  In that show  I didn't like it  It was him creeping around  It was windy  And he was huddling  Yeah it really isn't  Who cares  I like the show a lot  Actually Jimmy  I like the  After the bear guy  You can't  The real bear guy  But I never really thought 
[00:52:00]  That this was  A complete reality  It was a nice concept  And he shows him  Doing some crazy things  And you know  No one really needs  This advice to survive  No one's gonna get  In these situations  For most part  Yeah  It was just a fun  You know  Show to watch  But now  Now the show's  In deep trouble  Now that this is coming out  Listen the guy  What's his name  Timothy something  Who is the bear dude  Oh that guy was insane  What reality show  In the woods  Do you want to see  After a flaming homosexual  Holds bear dog  This was just inside of her 
[00:52:30]  And the bears all  Hate his guts  And they're finally good  And then eat his guts  And then finally eat him alive  Dumb girlfriend  I must say though  This guy that goes back  To the hotel rooms  There bear  He does eat  Some disgusting things  Yeah he's biting  The backs off fish  He's eating a worm  Right there  The fish have backs  He bit the head  Of a rattlesnake  Right  Or ate a rattlesnake  Well on the program  Grills appears to camp out  And quickly built shelters  Deep in the wilderness  While battling  Hypothermia  And dehydration 
[00:53:00]  But when the cameras  Stopped rolling  Grills has actually  Moved to luxurious hotels  That's nice  Do you know what  Got him though  What gave him away  Was the fact that  He was actually  Supposed to be  On an island  And when the camera  Panned  There was a room  Service tray  Let's see  Kenny was in the  Background  Where's the gym  Can I get you  Something beachy  What do you need  In the last two seasons  He and producers  Have contrived  Other scenes  To make it appear 
[00:53:30]  As if Grills  Is more skilled  Than he really is  And this is all  Coming from a consultant  They hired a consultant  Like a survivor  Consultant or something  For the show  If you really believe  Everything happens  The way it is shown  On TV  You are being  A little bit naive  The consultant said  Discovery Channel  Officials declined  To comment  But in the UK  Where the show  Airs with the title  Born Survivor  Stunned network  Officials at Channel 4  Said they are conducting  An internal investigation  On this  Don't consultants  Have to sign  A confidentiality thing  Apparently not  Yeah  Wow  I just ratted out 
[00:54:00]  The whole show  What happens to a consultant  Why don't you hire them  How about you  Shut your mouth  Basically they're saying  That you know  It wasn't based  In reality  Moving forward  The program  Will be 100%  Transparent  Well now they got  To deal with something  Anyway here's some  Of the things they did  According to this consultant  While filming in California  Sierra Nevada mountains  An episode in which  Grills 33 is seen  Biting off the head  Of a snake for breakfast  Grills actually spent  Some nights with the show's  Crew in a lodge  Outfitted with TVs  Stone fireplaces 
[00:54:30]  Hot tubs  And internet access  That sounds nice  The Pines Resort  At Bass Lake  Is advertised as  A cozy getaway  For families  And is a luxurious  Hotel with its own  Spa on a lake  In another instance  Where Grills was supposed  To be surviving  On a desert island  He was actually  In Hawaii  And spent nights  At a motel  The same episode  What  A motel  It just doesn't say  At the best places  So what  They found a little  Island off of Hawaii  That he was 
[00:55:00]  Making believe  Was in the middle of nowhere  Yeah  And then they probably  Just  Probably  And brought him  Back to Hawaii  I'm hiding here  In the woods  Oh no  It's Jack Lord  The same episode  Had Grills building  A Polynesian style raft  This was one of my  Favorite episodes actually  Using only materials  Around him  Including bamboo  And twine  And palm leaves  For sale  The consultant said  He actually led  A team of builders  To construct the raft  So the consultant  Built this thing for him  For the whole bunch  Of people  It was then taken apart 
[00:55:30]  So that Grills  Could be shown  Building it  On camera  Oh so it was already  Built like a model  Yeah  And then they just  Take it apart  And he puts it  Back together  Again  Jesus  And then they  Survival for the retarded  And then they show him  Quickly you know  Getting the raw materials  And then they  Kind of fast forward  A little bit  And now the sale  Is almost done  And everything else  Home depot guy  Behind him  Yeah  A big papaya sale  Look I've made a sale  Out of papaya  Ladies and gentlemen  Too bad  A papaya sale  Is going to blow me  To safety  Too bad he didn't 
[00:56:00]  Have any wizard  Yes  I've used my  Wizardry  Where I went  Ta-da  And a crew  Appeared  Wizardry  That guy's a douche  And then finally  In another episode  Viewers watched  As Grills tried to  Coax  What seemed like  A wild mustang  Into a lasso  In the Sierra Nevada  Oh to ride it  To safety  I'm in luck  He told viewers  Apparently coming  Across four wild  Horses grazing  In a meadow  Before the coax  People start calling  I'm sorry  Yeah  A chance to use  An old Native American 
[00:56:30]  Mode of transport  Comes my way  This is one of the  Few places in the  Whole of the U.S.  Where horses still  Roam wild  That's a quote from him  In fact a consultant  Said the horses  Were not wild  But were brought in  By a trailer  There's one now  Yeah  So that's  Big news today  That's like  On page three  Of our paper  How do you do that  In front of you  How embarrassing  Would that be  To like  Lasso a horse  That they brought in  Wouldn't you just  Feel like a jerk  Your crew's watching  Like this guy  They're just making 
[00:57:00]  Really good TV  It's a great concept  It's based on Survivor  Man  That's the show  That Patrice  Really really likes  Cause that guy  That guy  There you go  It's always better  With a gunshot  But Survivor Man  Has just him  In a camcorder  And you know  You don't get  The greatest footage  Cause you don't  Have the film crew  And that's what  This Man vs. Wild  Is based on  You know  They just jazzed it up  A bit  Patrice's hero  Is a fraud  No no no no  No no no  No no no  That's what 
[00:57:30]  I said the complete opposite  Patrice likes Survivor Man  Which is a different show  He kind of said  Man vs. Wild  Dude is a hack  Compared to Survivor Man  We had an argument  About this  And I'm like  But Man vs. Wild  Wild is better TV  Cause I've seen Survivor Man  And the footage  Kind of sucks  Cause it is just him  In a camcorder  It's like Blair Witch footage  Yeah a little camera there  If I might go back  12 years  I never saw that  I heard it was very scary  Hey do we have time  To talk about this as well  By the way  The Corey's coming in  At 8 o'clock  Footage  News footage of the day 
[00:58:00]  Though is that  Old World War 2  Plane landing on the highway  With the cop view camera  Chasing him down  That's great  He actually landed  On a curve  On the curve  Of a highway  Yeah  What happened  Obviously engine trouble  A little engine trouble  Yeah  You know you get an engine  That's 50-60 years old  Yeah  Yeah the Corey's  Are coming in at 8 o'clock  Corey Haim  And Corey Feldman  Yep  Macy's is dropping a shirt  That possibly offended  Hispanic people  Yeah that's the one  I want to get into  This is  This is so weird 
[00:58:30]  So ridiculous  Macy drops  T-shirt aimed at Hispanics  Because they are afraid  Of offending Hispanics  I don't get it  Because they made the shirt  For Hispanics to buy  In general  Yeah  Macy's  Will no longer  Stock a t-shirt  Because the company said  That a piece of clothing  May have offended  Potential customers  The shirt  Part of a clothing line  Exclusively aimed at  Latina shoppers  Looking to express  Cultural identity  Through fashion reads  Brown is the new white 
[00:59:00]  Across the chest  That is tacky  That is tacky  I think it's more offensive  To white people  Than it is to brown people  Well it's just  Crappy to everybody  Sorry but you know  We stop the show  Every time they do  The fat montage  They're doing a fat montage  Today  Hey  I love it  Fat montage  Fat montage on the news  Fat montage  Today's story  Something about soda  Could create heart risk  Yeah  Like one lousy soda a day  And you raise your risk  Of some kind of heart problem  So of course 
[00:59:30]  They have to show  A montage of  Just fat bellies  On TV  Without the heads  They don't show  Their faces  Or their heads  It's just pretty much  Chest down  Fat montage  And they show  Big fat bellies  And butts  I love fat montage  Because you know  Somebody at home  Sees it and goes  Wait  That's me  That's me  And I can't even  Tell my friends  I was on TV  Because they're  Kind of making fun of me  That's my shirt  And my pants  My fat ass  Just tight slacks  Looking awful 
[01:00:00]  Because you just  Don't want to buy  The larger size  You can't do it  To yourself  So you just keep  Squeezing into the  Same pants  Slacks  Alright  Anyway sorry  But we do stop  The show every time  We see fat  Montage on TV  So brown is the new  White  That's what it says  On the shirt  Huh  Macy's apologized  For its decision  To sell the shirt  And released a statement  We are constantly  Looking for unique  And differentiated  Merchandise  That will resonate  With our customers  As hip  Current  And trendy  We also continue  To work in  Developing business  Relationships  With minority vendors  To serve the growing 
[01:00:30]  Diverse customer base  Blah blah blah  Blah blah blah  Do you understand  Something here  Let me  Let me  Let me make a point  Here  Official statements  That was brought up  No  They actually  Apologized  For  Possibly  Offending  Somebody  Before they  Even sold  Something  They are jumping  On the  Make the excuse  And apologize  Bandwagon  Before anyone  Even got upset  And before  They even really  Officially started 
[01:01:00]  Selling these  Well I guarantee  If somebody complained  That's the only reason  You think  Of course  I'll tell you  What the shirt  Was supposed to read  But they didn't  Have the balls  To do it  What  Brown is the new  Black  Because that's  How it always goes  It's always the new  Black  In the fashion world  They say  Yellow this season  Is the new black  Right  Because black  Is always the  Fashionable  Right  Right  But they didn't  Have the balls  To say actually  What they really  Want to write  On the shirt  Which is  Brown is the new  Black  This is what  Bothers me the most  About the statement  The word  Differentiated  Why do you need 
[01:01:30]  That  It's like  We're constantly  Looking for unique  And different  Merchandise  What does  Differentiated mean  Can somebody  You look it up  I honestly don't  Know exactly  What it means  Compared to different  It's like saying  He likeded me  Accident  Iraq  Yeah  The rest of the  Statement goes  We apologize  If customers  Have found  Some of the  Merchandise  Offensive  And have removed  The style  That they found  Objectionable  Yeah  What a doodle  Apologize  Brown is the  New white  Yeah  I had an idea  For a shirt 
[01:02:00]  But it would have  Gotten me fired again  What a doodle  What was the idea  Well it had a picture  Of a truck on it  Let's just stop there  Bone dry  Can I tell you  I spoke to a girl  Who's a fan of the show  And she honestly  Thought that the  Greaseman was on  This show  Oh good  She said it's such  A perfect  She's like I used  To like the Greaseman  And I heard him  On your show  And I'm like  You  I wish people  Actually did think  It was the Greaseman  I could say 
[01:02:30]  Whatever I wanted  And he'd get fired  Could you imagine  If I got the Greaseman  Fired for saying something  But I didn't say that  I didn't say that  The Greaseman fired  Because you know  They wouldn't look  Into any details  On the news  Or anything  They would just fire him  Why would they  Actually like  Actually do research  The Greaseman  With more horrific  Racist comments  Here it is  What a doodle  You know what  You should like  Buy some time  On one of those  Tiny little stations  In the middle of nowhere  And just go on  As the Greaseman  And believe you're  The Greaseman  Just say the most  Horrific things  And then we'll send  The tape in  Turn him in 
[01:03:00]  Right  Turn him in  You'd think he's  Going crazy  I don't remember  Saying that  Well Brown  Is the new white  They're having a problem  With that t-shirt today  That's so ridiculous  Greaseman's not on  This show lady  No  I tied to tell her  It was me  Doing the impression  Of course  You tied to tell her  Did I say that  Yeah  Of course you did  I had to tell her  Did I say I tied to tell her  I tied to tell her  I get very young  I get very young  And innocent sometimes  I talk like a little boy 
[01:03:30]  I tied to tell her  After my biscetti  Alright  Hey  I put a bag  Over my head  Last night  And meeped  And my girlfriend  Thought it was adorable  I had an apple bag  Over my head  And I was meeping  And she thought  It was the cutest thing  And then she mentioned  My Cialis again  You know  You should have  Had a plastic bag  Over your head  I panicked  It was plastic  But it wasn't tied tight enough  I panicked  When I came home  And I opened up  My little cabinet  That I keep my tea in  And I saw it  Had been straightened  I'm like  Oh someone found a street 
[01:04:00]  I went in the bag  Was still tucked  Way back where it normally is  But pushed farther  I'm like  There's an outside chance  I'm like  Maybe she just shoved stuff in there  Oh no  What'd she do though  Was it  She just hinted  At like little things  Like while we were kissing  She just pulled out  A piece of cooked spaghetti  And started hitting me with it  Let's go to Jackie  What's up Jackie  Oh we have to take  A little issue with you  This morning  Why  At 6 o'clock

[01:06:00]  I've gone and I've lost  What I came with  So are you going to tell  Mohegan Sun to take their  Private plane or private jet  And shove it up there  You know what  No  No I want to fly on that thing  They have ways my friend  I want to fly on that  Next thing you know  You're in a private jet  Going up to Mohegan Sun  Drinking champagne  Champagne cocktails  Higher in the Sierra Mountains  They're going to be showing you  Like  They're going to be showing you  Sweets that you didn't even  Realize existed

[01:16:00]  Before she falls down  And this anchor  And the other guy  At the news desk  They are laughing  Hysterically  They cannot take it  They lost all sense  Of professionalism  It's great  Because in her mind  She's got to be like  As she's wavering  You got to be saying like  I'm a model  And I'm falling  On the runway  There's nothing worse  That can happen to a model  On a runway  Than falling  Than falling  And what else  Everything wrong  Well we love the laughs  So much  That  And they're news guys  These guys are anchormen  Yeah  I can't see them laughing 
[01:16:30]  At any other stories  Well  Danny came up with a couple  And actually a listener  Out of nowhere  We didn't even ask for this  He sent one in  As well  So you get the  You get the  The reporters laughing  Over other things  You geek  That's great though  What happened  Wow  She goes down  Like the walker  In Return of the Jedi  Very slow  Wabbly legs  Come on  I gotta give

[01:17:30]  And all the folks  Between the  That is terrible  Why are you all  Just doing  To the children  Right now  Didn't you  It's not bad. 
[01:18:00]  It's not bad. 
[01:18:30]  I'll say 37.  So it's got to be one of those weird years.  Is it 37?  There you go.  I know my Nazi stuff.  I know my Nazi stuff, my friend.  May 6th, and we didn't celebrate that.  Why would we celebrate?  Could have been Hindenburg Tuesday.  Big swastika coming into Lakehurst.  Could have set one of our listeners on fire.  here comes he's he's in a wow shirt it's oh no oh the catastrophe well we uh that goes back 60 
[01:19:00]  years 60 years this next one goes back uh a mere three days oh it's tammy fay is the pain constant  what did they what did they give you for the pain

[01:21:00]  Oh, my God.  Holy Jesus, Danny, that is horrid.  Wait a minute.  I had made the decision back in the office that I just, I don't want to go to heaven.  Oh, my God. 
[01:21:30]  We are officially garbage.  Oh, this is like the simplest bit you can do.  It's just combining two pieces of audio.  When the model was falling and they're laughing, it's fine.  Right.  It's funny.  I'm sure the model didn't have a good time doing it.  But, boy, you put that laugh to other things, it just becomes heinous.  When a brain-dead woman is slowly dying.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, it's not so funny.  And then the anchor goes, wait, wait, hold on, wait, wait, wait. 
[01:22:00]  Oh.  Wow.  Yeah.  Look, I want to apologize if any vegetables were offended by that remark.  Yeah.  I'm sorry that I did that.  A bit.  Yeah.  I'm embarrassed that I did that.  Wow.  That works.  I can apologize to the Shivo family as well as broccoli and zucchini.  I'm going to meet with a couple of carrots and a tomato. 
[01:22:30]  And, of course, an eggplant.  And apologize.  I'm going to go on the Eggplants radio show and apologize.  We're talking about vegetables.  Calm down, everyone.  No.  What happened?  Nothing.  www.overexplained.com.  Yeah.  And you're a cantaloupe. 
[01:23:00]  Oh.  All right.  We have the two chorus coming up.  Can I make one correction?  Yes.  Because Kenny screwed up.  My book signing for Thursday in Long Island is 7.30, not 7 p.m.  That's this Thursday at the Barnes and Nobles, according to the retard that wrote this.  91 Old Country Road in Carl Place, New York.  Yes.  Anthony will be there.  We got the two quarries coming up next. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  Sundays at 10 p.m. is when the show's on.  On A&E.  We're premiering this Sunday.  If Kenny wrote it, A&E's.  A&E's.  He likes to pluralize that.  There it is.  Hey, get that in my machine.  It's Fred.  Yeah, you're going to be hearing that a lot in the next few months.  That was me.  With Anthony going off on his gambling thing.  All right.  We're going to regroup. 
[01:24:00]  Are they here?  What?  What was that about?  I just said yes very quietly because I'm not entirely sure, but they were coming up.  Oh, okay.  We'll figure it out next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Still waiting for the quarries to show up.  The two quarries is the name of the show.  It's on A&E.  Starting this Sunday at 10 p.m.  You're taking out Opie and Anthony.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A is our phone number. 
[01:24:30]  Jimmy's got his lost boy DVD.  I do, but it's not open.  And A-Rock didn't take mine over there with everybody else's.  And I don't know what he's doing.  I'm just trying to be a part of the show.  What is he rock doing?  We can start a bit here.  Where's Jared?  Jared.  Eat the sandwich.  Used to be known as Cream Pie Jones.  That didn't last long.  No, no.  Information update.  What?  What?  What happened?  Nothing.  Oh, a note. 
[01:25:00]  Here's in communique.  Okay.  Thank you.  But what does it say?  I just read it.  But I wanted to.  We got a few more minutes.  Oh.  All right.  We can do some Jared.  Jared in studio.  Sam sent Jared out on the street, right?  Sam?  Part of this bit?  Of course, it's all about Harry Potter.  Harry Potter.  It's all about Harry Potter.  The young Potter boy.  I guess Stan finished the book, too, huh? 
[01:25:30]  Oh, yeah.  You're a quick reader.  He didn't want it spoiled for him.  He didn't want a spoiler.  So he read 500 pages over the weekend, and then he finished it the last day or two.  But then, with no regard for anybody else in the office, he just blurts out, like, spoilers  because he's done reading the book.  I knew I was going to break your little heart, Ant, if you knew what happened.  I was a little bummed that you spoiled it for me, but I'll be good.  So what did we do with Jared?  Killed him?  What?  No.  Oh, he's right there. 
[01:26:00]  Jared went to a Borders.  Oh, Barnes & Noble.  Barnes.  Oh, sorry.  Oh, wow.  Hey, that makes the whole bed.  I'm sorry.  In his hometown.  At midnight.  Doodyville?  Yes.  Doodyville.  When the book was going on sale, and he took a video camera that needed to...  It was not digital at all.  It was probably made in 1991.  What was it?  One of those big VHS tapes?  Yes, it was super VHS.  So he had to put the tape in a VHS adapter.  The adapter? 
[01:26:30]  And then gave it to me and said, here's what I got.  All right.  Which is why we didn't have it yesterday.  It took a full day to get it.  Did you do that on your own?  Yeah.  Good for you.  Hey, kid's got initiative.  Hey, more importantly, why aren't we hearing Sam's music?  I mean...  Oh, because, you know...  All right.  I would love to know what Sam has...  All right.  So, Jared, you interviewed some of the people on the line there, and then you casually just  started spewing spoilers.  Yeah, I did it under the guise that I was making student film for my senior film class. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  And that I was doing a documentary on the Harry Potter craze.  Yeah.  And people were somewhat willing to be interviewed.  A lot of people liked being on the camera.  Okay.  So you talked to Lauren and Christina here.  Yeah.  They're like just about to go into college, girls that are very into Harry Potter.  Okay.  Well, everyone that would be on this line would be very into Harry Potter.  What tipped you off?  The midnight standing there waiting for a book?  A lot of the people there, like, you could tell there's a difference between, like, the 
[01:27:30]  casual reader who likes to read it because of the book and the people who dress up like  little school children and other characters from the book.  Were there people with little round glasses and the lightning bolt scars on their head?  Oh, yeah.  There was a lot of people with the round glasses, but they had, like, holes through it, so there  was no actual glass in it.  It was just the frames.  That's okay.  Good luck.  And there were a lot of people wearing scarves.  Yeah. 
[01:28:00]  I think the Gryffindor scarf.  Oh, well, I know about that.  I don't know what he's talking about.  Well, why don't we play the audio here?  You talk to Lauren and Christina online to get their Harry Potter book.  The guy from NXS had.  Here we go.  I don't know if you guys could help me out.  It's about the Harry Potter craze.  Sure.  Okay.  Like, what got you guys in the Harry Potter?  I was never really that into the whole, you know, that type of book, but after I just  read about it, I just really got into it. 
[01:28:30]  All right.  That's cool.  I was just curious.  Were you guys aware that Beatrix kills Ron?  Uh, no.  No.  And that, uh, Voldemort kills Snape?  No.  No, you guys weren't aware of that?  I don't like a really spoiler thing.  Or, uh, that Percy dies and Lupin dies?  I think it's like, I'm sick.  No, you weren't aware of that?  I think you're an ass.  They're still giggling as they're calling you an ass.  Well, because they don't really understand what's happening, and then it, like, sinks 
[01:29:00]  in.  It sinks in, like, oh my God, he's ruining the whole book.  That I'm waiting online for.  Which we have also just done for everybody on the air.  Yeah.  By the way.  Yeah.  That was our first kind of big spoiler.  Give me a break.  We waited a week.  We could have done this a week ago.  Two weeks ago.  In 1201, we should have spit out something.  1201.  It was on the internet before that.  Okay, let me just say, uh, there are spoilers in this bit.  Oh, okay. 
[01:29:30]  Uh, Lauren and Christina try not to believe Jared?  You continue with these two?  Yeah, you see, a lot of people were trying to play it off like they didn't really care.  Right.  But, like, you could see on their faces that, like, they were just really disappointed over it.  Okay.  You know Harry Potter lives at the end, right?  It's a good versus evil story.  Why would you say?  Well, what, how do you feel about that?  I think this is weird.  I know. 
[01:30:00]  Are you disappointed now that you know what happens in Harry Potter?  I don't think you actually read the book.  I was kind of trying to block it out.  Yeah.  I don't know if I believe it, but.  Ron dies.  We'll see what happens.  What a jerk.  Well, have fun and enjoy.  I like his delivery with this whole thing, though.  He's a Ronda.  Just in case you forgot, when she said she tried to block it out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ronda.  Ronda.  Did you show him that picture?  Of Harry Potter and the horse?  It's good to know Travis is back working. 
[01:30:30]  Lots of things.  He's bringing back an old bit.  Every time we mention anything that has to do with Harry Potter, he has to bring in Harry Potter nude.  Ah, his picture from Equus.  Get that down, E-Rock.  I will not stare at his junk.  I wish the horse thought it was a carrot and just bit it.  Jared talks to Stephanie about her favorite character.  Hey, Reed.  Yeah.  And her favorite character is Ron, and of course Jared has to say that.  Oh, no.  Ron dies. 
[01:31:00]  And it says in this clip, listen for her response.  Yeah, Stephanie.  Listen closely.  There's a good one?  Yeah.  Stephanie is this girl I used to work with when I spent a short stint at working in a movie theater.  And the movie theater is in the mall with the bookstore.  So I saw her there.  Your assistant to the assistant manager at a movie theater.  Exactly.  That's exactly what I was.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Does it matter?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's where I'm getting it.  Yeah.  Okay.  And her parents met while they were in the grandkin.  Yeah. 
[01:31:30]  Stephanie, how did you get into Harry Potter?  I got into it as a movie.  They made me read them.  They made you read them, and now you're into them all the time?  She is more or less than me, but yeah.  But you're a big Harry Potter fan?  I'm a Ron fan.  You're a Ron fan?  Yeah.  You're a big Ron fan?  Just the red hair that loves me.  Were you aware that Beatrix kills Ron in the seventh book?  I hate you.  What did you hear?  She says, I hate you.  Oh, really? 
[01:32:00]  I hate you.  Did you guys hear that?  Yes.  I missed that.  Out and clear.  She just stares right at her.  I hate you.  And then Stephanie gets upset with Jared as he continues to spoil the book.  I like how he picks his targets to the little chicks.  So Ron gets killed, huh?  Yeah.  How does that happen, by the way?  No idea.  I don't read Harry Potter.  He gets shot.  How does that happen?  In a drive-by accidentally?  It happens when you read false spoilers.  Oh, really? 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  But it doesn't matter.  They don't know that.  The book's still ruined for them.  So you're saying that might not necessarily be true.  Not at all.  Couldn't be less true.  Ron doesn't die.  Nope.  But maybe he does die, and now Thanh's throwing everyone out.  That's true.  Wow.  That would be brilliant if they realized that people were going to do this and just throw  spoilers all over the internet.  I think Ron's a very likable character.  I've read the book.  I can ruin it.  I don't care about anybody else.  I'm fine.  Oh, okay.  Any information you guys want, I will divulge. 
[01:33:00]  Because I was trying to imagine how they would kill off a likable character like that.  Would it be horrific or kind of an implied thing?  Or it doesn't happen at all?  I don't know.  Does Harry get context?  Yes.  Finally realize he looks like a nerd.  All right.  Here's more Stephanie with Jared.  I would totally jump you if that was true.  It is.  It's not.  It's true. 
[01:33:30]  I'm a kid.  Are you also aware that Voldemort kills Snape?  Why are you telling me that Snape?  You really want to get killed, though, right?  Yeah.  I have a death wish.  Yeah.  Well, to put a positive spin on it, Harry does live.  I don't care.  It's about Ron.  Thank you.  I don't care.  It's about Ron.  Thank you.  That was a good interview.  He did it with Fez. 
[01:34:00]  Jared talks to a couple about who their favorite characters are, then spoils the book again.  Who is your favorite character in one?  Favorite character?  Mine would have to be Hermione.  I think she's a very strong character.  You know, she shows that women have to be smart, go straight, and...  I like Snape because it's a dark and evil sign.  Oh, yeah?  Are you excited about the new book that's going out?  Yeah, I really haven't heard too much about it.  No?  I'm interested to read it.  Oh, yeah?  You know that Voldemort kills Snape? 
[01:34:30]  Does he really?  Yeah.  And that...  Oh, wait.  No.  No more.  Beatrix kills Ron?  No.  I don't want to do it anymore.  No more.  Yeah.  But you'll be happy to know that Harry lives.  Harry lives.  Thank you.  You ass.  Thank you.  God, these guys are uber fans.  You can just hear their voices.  You know, Snape is really...  I like his character.  It's like, well, do you know? 
[01:35:00]  The guy's whole face just turns.  He's kind of smiling.  He's like, yeah, Snape is my favorite character.  Yeah, I haven't heard anything about this book, but I can't wait to read it.  And he's like, you know, Snape dies, right?  And he goes, just straight frown.  What?  And being adults, they don't want to get so upset over the fact that it's spoiled for them.  All right.  And finally, Jared talks to Megan as she's about to get to the cash register about her prediction  whole book.  This is right at the cash register?  Yeah.  She was one of the big uber fans. 
[01:35:30]  She was wearing a t-shirt, and she was just so excited, and she was just talking about  Harry Potter this and Harry Potter that.  And I was like, I just have to interview and ruin it for her.  And then the line thanks you or something?  What was that about?  It was a very sarcastic thank you.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  God, you got balls, man.  You must be really excited about this book, huh?  Yeah.  I just finished reading the sixth book for the third time.  I read the rest of the books like ten times, but I'm really excited. 
[01:36:00]  What do you think's going to happen?  Oh, oh, that's not a good question to ask right now.  Why?  God, I feel like I'm accepting a happy award.  Well, I really, really hope that Harry makes it in the end.  I'm one of the Harry pushers.  Really?  I'm not a Draco fan.  I really would.  For your reassurance, Harry does live.  What?  Yes.  You don't know that.  I also know that...  I really, what? 
[01:36:30]  Voldemort kills Snape.  Sorry, sorry.  Did you even give a minute to me?  Thanks, guys.  You're letting us know.  You're welcome.  You're welcome.  Thanks, guys, for letting us know.  You are a complete ass.  Very good.  He's got a really good delivery when it comes to this.  He's not sarcastic about it or anything.  There's no emotion there.  Yeah.  Hey, by the way.  It's like he's too stupid to realize he shouldn't be doing it. 
[01:37:00]  That's his delivery.  Hey, you know, you want to know something?  No.  You probably didn't get hit because they thought you were retarded.  No, that was one of the things I was worried about the most was being chased out and...  By Harry Potter fans.  Oh, yeah.  They're casting little spells on you with their little wands.  I was worried that I was going to get barrauded by wands and scarves and glasses.  Yeah, little glasses.  Do that at the next 50 Cent movie premiere. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're going to do the same thing with a 50 Cent movie.  I'm game.  You'll be game, all right.  It's the wrong name to throw out at a 50 Cent movie premiere.  You know what I think about the Hip Hop Wars.  By the way, very sad to see this on Instant Feedback.  Bill Klein from Philly.  I mean, as hardcore as they come as far as the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Very sad today.  Why?  He's extremely sad.  Is he a big Harry Potter fan?  I'm sorry, Bill.  I truly am sorry. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, Bill.  What else, Sam?  No, just the whole afternoon before he was going, he was IMing me saying,  Well, do you think I should park my car like three blocks away?  I don't want anybody following me or knowing my license plate or trying to track me out.  They're Harry Potter fans.  Yeah, exactly.  If you're afraid of Harry Potter fans, dude, they're numerous, but boof.  You could fight them off like nothing.  The license plate thing.  What's the matter, Travis Bickle?  Are you afraid they're going to...  You're not going to be able to save that 12-year-old hooker?  My license plate.  What are they going to do?  They're Harry Potter fans. 
[01:38:30]  They're a bunch of...  You heard giggling girls.  You're afraid of giggling girls?  It would have been hilarious if giggling girls beat you up.  Just beat the crap out of them.  Yeah, it would have been funny.  Coming all bloodied and black and blue.  A college girl hit me.  He was afraid a father would punch him.  He was afraid or some male employee or some...  He was afraid that a real male would walk over.  Yeah, a real man.  Yeah.  Is that what it was about?  Some hardcore big guy who's just, you know...  All right.  Because there were a lot of big guys there that were huge Harry Potter fans. 
[01:39:00]  And you obviously avoided them.  Yes.  Were you afraid that they would punch you right in your tight jean thighs?  Those things are at the point of tearing.  I was ready to run any moment and then...  I probably wouldn't do you very much good.  We'll either read a chapter and then catch you.  You're a good boy, Jared, but you're not speedy.  Really?  The water buffalo runs from the cheetah. 
[01:39:30]  Well, where's Sam's music?  I mean, he's in here.  We might as well do this real quick.  Sam.  It's time to ask Sam what he had for dinner.  Well, Sam, as we all know, eats the same thing an eight-year-old eats.  How old are you?  23.  You're 23, yet he eats like a child every single day and night.  And the beauty of this bit, we don't even ask him ahead of time.  We just know this is radio gold.  We know that he will not disappoint with this bit.  He doesn't like things like burgers and things that adults eat. 
[01:40:00]  He just eats kids' food.  Yeah.  So, what did you have last night?  Last night was fish sticks with a side of pizza rolls.  Fish sticks and pizza rolls.  And, of course, a glass of milk.  A big glass of icy cold milk.  Why milk with every meal?  I don't get it.  That's what I like.  I gotta have it, especially dinner.  I gotta have it with dinner.  What about water?  No.  No.  What about like a Snapple or some kind of iced tea? 
[01:40:30]  I need milk with dinner.  You know what's disgusting about milk when you're eating and drinking milk?  Especially something like pizza rolls.  Do you get any sauce on your mouth and it ends up like a film on top of the milk?  Do you see an oil slick on top of the milk at all?  No?  No.  I bet you do.  Fish stick.  Like fish stick crumbs that are on your lip and all of a sudden they're floating in the milk.  I'm a neat eater.  So, it's fish sticks.  Good boy.  Pizza rolls and milk.  And of course, then he has dessert.  Oh, dessert. 
[01:41:00]  Dessert is always to work.  Dessert's a big thing for our little Sam.  Go ahead, Sam.  I had a bowl with three scoops of Neapolitan ice cream.  That's all three flavors.  Vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry.  Did you have three scoops?  Did you get one scoop of each?  Or did you just do three scoops of each?  I like each scoop to have a little bit of each flavor in it.  Wow, that's kind of adult.  And did you throw anything on top of it?  No, no sundae this time because we don't have anything in the house.  But what would you usually, you know, put on the top of your ice cream? 
[01:41:30]  Sprinkles?  Maybe.  Little baby marshmallows?  Chocolate sauce and rainbow sprinkles.  Maybe.  Jesus Christ.  Do you think you'll ever eat big man food?  What's big man food?  It's like a steak, some type of chicken, you know, a real fish.  Like, not fish sticks.  No, I don't think I will. 
[01:42:00]  No, you never will.  I doubt it.  And what about vegetables?  Oh, and some tomatoes.  My girlfriend makes me eat some vegetables.  She makes him.  His girlfriend makes him eat vegetables.  She has to do the airplane hanger thing.  Yeah.  Come on.  Here comes the airplane.  Oh, little Sam.  All right, Sam.  You're adorable.  Thank you.  Really fast.  We got the Corys in the green room.  We're going to talk to them next about their new show, The Two Corys, on A&E, Sunday, 
[01:42:30]  10 p.m.  But unlucky lottery.  We love these stories.  As we go to break, it's a quickie.  Unlucky lottery.  Or this isn't Sucks to Be You, right?  No, I think this is unlucky lottery.  They're very similar.  Similar.  It's very hard to distinguish the two.  We find these weird stories.  Basically, yeah, it's unlucky lottery, because I think you have a better chance to winning  like a million dollars through the lottery than this happening to you.  So, yeah, this is unlucky lottery.  So, it's unlucky lottery, which, yeah, the same odds. 
[01:43:00]  It's like a million to one that this is going to happen.  But instead of winning the lottery, yeah, more than that.  Millions to one.  Instead of you winning the lottery, you win this horrible thing that happens.  Right.  Some people lucky enough to win the lottery.  Some people unlucky enough to have something like this happen.  Sucks to Be You can really happen to anybody, but, ooh, it happened to you, and that sucks.  So, sucks to be you.  Right.  That's like, you know, a tree falling on your car while you're sitting in it in your driveway.  Right.  It's not that out of the ordinary.  Can happen.  Things like that. 
[01:43:30]  All right, here we go.  Here's today's unlucky lottery story.  Back here in this country, a tragic story from the east coast of Florida, where a scuba diver is dead.  After lightning struck his oxygen tank, he was 36-year-old Steve Wilson.  He was north of Fort Lauderdale.  This happened yesterday afternoon.  A storm developed, and as Wilson resurfaced, that's when a bolt of lightning hit the tank.  Other divers pulled him to the boat and brought him to shore, where witnesses frantically tried to save him.  We saw that he was in trouble, and we just started giving him CPR and tried to help him, 
[01:44:00]  and then as soon as enough people got, we got him out of the boat.  It's unclear, as of right now, whether Wilson died from electrocution or drowning.  What are the odds?  You pop up, and at that moment, lightning hits your oxygen tank.  Well, the odds are pretty good, actually, if you're in an ocean, which is just filled with water,  and you have metal on your back.  It's not exactly like...  But I mean, what are the odds?  I mean, I've never heard this before.  It's going to pop up.  Probably because most scuba guys are smart enough to stay home when it's like a lightning storm.  Yeah.  Just idiots outside, traipsing around the ocean. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  Could you go to the door there?  Yeah.  Thank you.  Tomatoes are fruit.  Tomatoes are...  They're vegetables.  It's all a vegetable.  Stop it with a fruit vegetable argument.  I know the scientists would tell you it's a fruit, but look, you don't cut it up and put  it on your cereal or ice cream or something.  If you got a fruit salad or a fruit plate from a hotel, and they had chopped up tomatoes in  there, you'd go, what the hell is this on my kiwi? 
[01:45:00]  Of course it's not a fruit.  Bill Kaye, who is a faithful listener, still going at it.  Hey, Opie, I hope your nephews and nieces were listening to your show, and they hate  you for the rest of your life.  Oof.  See, the anger always comes at me for some reason.  But Bill, I got to tell you, you're a faithful listener to the show.  If we're going to sit someone down like Jared and say he was on a Harry Potter line, what  the F do you think he was going to do?  How about this, stupid...  Go somewhere for 15 minutes.  Grow up. 
[01:45:30]  It's a child's book.  But we gave people enough time to realize, oh, this isn't going to be good.  He's not actually interviewing people about the Harry Potter mania.  It's obviously going to have some Opie and Anthony ridiculous twist to it.  So I blame you, Bill, for not being smart enough to turn the radio dial.  Yeah, Bill.  Plus, he was wrong.  Plus, yeah, some of that stuff might have been wrong.  Exactly.  Harry develops the virus and he takes a cocktail and that's how it ends.  Get a hold of yourself, stupid.  People being beheaded in the Middle East. 
[01:46:00]  What does the bespectacle wizard do?  What happens?  He's a douche and so are you.  Bespectacle.  Does he still practice wizardry until his old age?  Who cares?  Stupid fruity book.  This is the hallowed.  This is the deathly hallowed.  What happened?  What happened?  I don't know.  Girls, stop liking you.  You nerd.  But he got rid of the glasses. 
[01:46:30]  I'm sure he did.  He got involved with the whole wizardry thing.  This is wizard school.  They're all wizards, are they?  I'm a muggle.  I'm a muggle.  What's wrong with being a muggle?  Everything is all about being a muggle.  It means you're a douche.  It's the same thing.  Dumbest word ever.  We got the two Corys waiting.  All right.  Two Corys waiting.  We'll go to them next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Entering the studio, the two Corys.  Morning.  Corey Haim.  Corey Feldman.  What's up, bro?  Good to see you, man. 
[01:47:00]  What's up, Corey?  And your hot girlfriend or wife?  Wife, right?  Huh?  You guys are babbling.  I can't hear.  You got to be in front of a mic and then we can talk about everything.  He's, uh...  You got to see?  I can't hear.  You guys just sit down and then we can hear everything.  Susan?  That's...  Oh, yeah.  Pop down.  In the comfy chair.  It's very nice.  You guys opened the studio up.  I like it.  Yeah.  Big improvements around here.  Now, that's your...  All right. 
[01:47:30]  Now, that's your wife or girlfriend?  Beautiful...  Well, it depends.  Whatever you want to call her.  Whatever you want to call her.  Wife?  Susie, right?  Yes.  Yeah, I saw the...  It's on a hard sale today, so you just...  Whoa, whoa.  What happened?  No, nothing.  I'm just joking.  Oh, okay.  She's going to check, check, check, check.  She is the official wife.  The official wife.  And I noticed...  Of the 2007 Olympics.  Oh, really?  Of the Olympic Games.  I noticed that Corey Haim sits way over there, and I...  Yeah.  I said it that way.  It's just for odor purposes.  I saw the first episode of the two Corey's.  The first thing I noticed, that Corey Haim, not too happy about the situation. 
[01:48:00]  No, no.  It's beautiful.  Oh, that's all a bunch of BS.  Really?  BS, baby.  BS.  Don't believe everything you see on TV.  Yeah.  But aren't you supposed to on this show?  Right.  Oh, yeah.  It's like, don't believe everything you see.  Wait a minute.  Hey, man.  Never mind.  Never mind.  Believe it.  This is reality.  You're doing a reality show, so you kind of want them to at least think that this is  reality.  It's not really reality.  It's just tapping the line of reality.  Yeah.  There's a difference.  There's a difference.  It's entertainment, folks. 
[01:48:30]  It's entertainment.  Now, you guys were brought up a lot on those VH1 shows for a while, like, you know, the  Isle of the Games, things like that.  They'll bring us up for the rest of our lives.  Yeah.  We can't help it.  We can't escape it.  And I assume that's why they decided, hey, you know, this would be a great idea to get  you guys together to do something.  Well, there's been a lot of that in the last 10 years.  Yeah.  Oh, well, how about this one?  Or how about that?  They've come up with the stupidest ideas on Earth.  Look, Corey Feldman, you do pop up a lot throughout history.  I just pop a lot.  You just kind of pop up.  Yeah.  I just pop. 
[01:49:00]  And you kind of, Corey Haim kind of disappeared for a while.  Hey, man, I just figure if you're going to bail, bail, come back.  Bail completely?  Or braddle, man.  Because you were like, you were pretty much top of your game as a kid star could be.  You were like, really top of your game.  And then you just kind of disappeared.  I just actually discovered I love long vacations and holidays, man.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  And that lasted years.  Years?  Yeah.  That is a long.  You took the back door.  I might be Simone by now. 
[01:49:30]  I'm not sure.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  I might be Simone.  You know, foreigner for sure.  What was your longest layoff?  Been away that long, bro.  You know?  In a great way, yeah.  What was the longest layoff you had?  How long have you been laid?  What?  Is that what you were trying to say?  Way longer than you.  What time did you go?  Am I better looking women?  Yeah, right.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, right.  You know, that battle could be.  I don't know your wife here.  Where's your wife?  Yeah, exactly.  Thank you very much, honey.  See?  Okay.  Round one.  That would be a great line if she.  Game, set, and match. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, that would be a great line if she was ugly or something.  There's nothing wrong with Susie.  Right.  She's nothing wrong.  Hey, hey, hey.  My sister, be nice.  It's like nothing wrong.  I appreciate you saying nothing wrong.  No, I'm just saying, like, you would make a joke like that.  No, no, no.  It's just if Felman wants to pick up for her, I have to.  You notice the two in the room without the hot chick sitting next to him.  Those are the ones that are talking crap.  And you notice the one that's the only one defending Susie is Haim.  Oh, thank you, Haim.  You know what?  God bless you, Haim.  Oh, no.  God bless you.  You're so good to me.  Oh, I love you. 
[01:50:30]  How often did you guys talk to each other, like, after you were doing movies together, and then you decided  to go to Samoa for it?  I just met him, man.  We decided it was best just not to talk.  Did you just not talk for a while?  No, no, no.  We talked for a while.  You always stayed in contact with each other?  Yeah.  I mean, it's like, you know, when you've got a brother, you know, even though you guys may  fight sibling rivalry, whatever happens.  You must have an old-time friend for over 20 years.  You've got to forgive and forget.  Yeah, definitely.  You know when it's up.  Yeah, totally.  You know what's going on.  But, like, you guys had this working relationship also, so I don't know.  Sure.  I wasn't sure if you had that. 
[01:51:00]  You can call it that.  Or whatever it was.  I mean...  It just...  Look, let's be blunt.  I just permanently damaged his knees, man.  That's all.  You two were just the...  You were the guys, man, back then, and it was just about...  We're the guys now.  Probably chicks.  No, we're the guys now.  Then we were kids who had no idea what we were doing.  Yeah, but that's what I mean.  Like, there were probably girls throwing themselves at you at a young age.  You guys are...  I have no idea what you're talking about, man.  I don't understand.  What's a girl?  I don't even know what a girl is, man.  A girl is probably, like I said, was throwing themselves at you when you were still throwing 
[01:51:30]  up on us.  Oh, sorry.  I'm just using these as supermodels.  Not girls, sorry.  That's a girl.  Supermodels, too.  Gotcha.  Right.  But it's probably an odd situation to be in so young.  They were throwing up on us, actually.  Throwing up on us.  I can't.  I only surround myself with great-looking people other than Corey.  I mean, you know.  Yeah?  Are we getting anywhere in this conversation?  Not really.  Everyone's just talking about the same time.  I'm trying to dig.  I'm trying to dig.  Let's talk about the show, yeah?  I'm trying to dig.  Oh, yeah?  We'll talk about the show.  Cool.  Cool.  We'll get time to talk about that.  Loving it.  Later.  You guys seem to have a nice, stable relationship. 
[01:52:00]  And you decided to throw a monkey wrench into it.  That's right.  A monkey.  A monkey.  Here.  I'm going to give you the real quick short synopsis.  Basically, this is a new brand of television.  Okay?  This is not what you're expecting to see.  It is a reality show in a sense that the emotions conveyed are real.  However, that said, it is scripted to the sense that we write a show and we have a beginning  and a middle and an end.  And every show tells a story and has a positive message in it. 
[01:52:30]  So, it's actually, each week that you watch is really like watching a little mini movie.  That's the way Corey described it last night.  He was right on.  Well, thank God you're admitting to that.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Why the positive message?  You don't need a positive message.  Because we believe in putting positive things into the world.  Screw the positive message.  There you go.  Corey Haim's with me.  There's enough negativity already, I think, in the world.  Enough contempt.  Yeah.  We're not trying to filter the world.  Look at Corey.  He's not.  Corey Haim not happy with that statement. 
[01:53:00]  No, no, no.  I'm just, good morning, man.  He just got here.  Oh, I thought he was acknowledging me.  He's just acknowledging his hangover.  That's his way of stretching.  What kind of positive messages would you convey?  Well, okay, well, let's say the first episode where Corey moves in, we have, you know, we  have differences because Corey still smokes.  We don't smoke.  And he comes over to our house.  It's a bit unruly.  And we have a PETA lady over because we're working on a new campaign for PETA.  She must have a good sense of humor. 
[01:53:30]  And so we have, she had a very good sense of humor.  Ethical treatment of animals.  That's right.  She was very understanding.  She was very, she was very forgiving, shall we say.  Anyway, so we had her over because we're having this serious dinner about, you know,  creating a campaign for PETA and putting our statement out there and, and the positive  message and all that kind of stuff.  And then Corey, of course, just kind of splatters that one all over the wall.  It's like the queen, you know, vegan walks in, I think I actually call her that on the  show and she walks into, you know, Corey and Susie and they're hardcore into it and  they're trying to get me into it.  And Corey doesn't take it seriously at all. 
[01:54:00]  He just wants to get laid.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  They're, you know, I just, um.  A little bit.  You'll always see them doing something.  So whenever you walk into like a pornographic movie in real life with your buddy, you kind  of want to get laid, but it's kind of eerie feeling because your sister and your  brother, so that, you know what I mean?  But, uh, no, it's just like my character, you know, puts the ice cubes in the cup too  loud, uh, interrupts, uh, I'm not so much into the, you know, the animal, you know, or  the animal or, you know, you're not a vegetarian, hardcore on camera. 
[01:54:30]  I just very, yeah, I just, I mean, they're vegans.  I'm not.  So anyway, as you can see, comedy ensues.  Well, ice cubes in the cup too loud.  That's not exactly destructive.  Oh, it's destructive.  Thank you.  I don't think there's actually, I don't think that beat ever plays in the show actually,  but you know, in his mind, that's the big problem is the.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anyway.  So, so the first episode is Corey trying to get, you know, the pita girl naked in the  hot tub.  And of course, you know, the positive message is don't try to get a pita girl naked. 
[01:55:00]  All right.  So that's a good, all right.  That's a good positive.  I got to agree with you there.  Cause, uh, you know, most pita girls can see.  She's actually pretty hot.  But she had a boyfriend though, and that's her job is to go around in a yellow bikini.  Don't give away, don't give away the whole.  No, no, no, no, no.  In real life, they have these people.  See, he's scrounging.  You're jumping.  No, no, no.  I just look at one of these sites.  No one's going to watch now.  No, no, no.  I've seen these sites.  Like they go around in yellow bikinis and like, you're killing, you know, chickens in  the wrong way.  And they have like these signs and she was one of those girls. 
[01:55:30]  They should lull chickens to sleep.  Right.  There's a good way to kill chickens.  Yes.  To lull them to sleep.  Corey Haim says there's a better way to kill chickens.  Damn right.  Wow.  So I saw, I thought I saw the first episode, but the episode you're describing is a different  one than I saw.  Yeah, as you see, we like to keep people on edge.  But basically.  No, you saw episode three.  I think.  I just want to set this up now that we're 10 minutes into this.  The two Corys, basically, Corey Feldman has a fine mansion and Corey Haim needed a place 
[01:56:00]  to stay because, you know.  That's wrong, but okay.  Oh, okay.  He was coming in for the last 20th anniversary.  Okay.  That's the setup.  And he's now living with Corey Feldman and his lovely wife, Susie.  Correct.  Right.  And what I learned.  The one that's better than average.  And what I learned.  What I learned from the first episode is that TV is completely wrong because I thought  you were a mess too there, Corey Feldman, and it turns out you got your act together.  He's been good.  Now, why did you think that?  All the freaking behind the music specials and all that crap they do, aren't you? 
[01:56:30]  Right, right.  Well, see, what does that teach you?  It goes back to don't believe everything you see on TV.  Yeah, don't believe everything you see on TV.  But you were a child star.  You have to be screwed up.  It's the law.  Oh, right.  Right.  It's the law.  I think.  You gave me an up.  No, I'm liking the coffee.  It was great, man.  I think the law is don't believe everything you hear about.  Don't believe the hype.  It's a sequel.  No, you know, there's a lot of misinformation out there in the world.  Yeah.  And they like to skew it that way because it's a better story, right? 
[01:57:00]  Ah, this guy's cracked.  He lost his freaking mind.  True.  It's a better story.  You know, it's like, oh, no, he's great, and he does a lot of political environmental stuff.  That's what he's about.  Well, there have been some screw-ups, you know, that have come out of child acting.  Well, and I made my own mistakes.  I don't say that I'm perfect.  Who doesn't?  How long ago was that?  Nobody's perfect.  A long time ago.  But, Tosh, we see you every once in a while.  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm 36 today.  Yeah.  And I just had my birthday.  Thanks, thanks.  Oh, happy birthday.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Mine was a few days ago.  Glad to be spending it with you.  Oh, well, let's do that. 
[01:57:30]  Actually, we're doing a party at the Marquee Club on Wednesday night.  You should come down.  That sounds like an invite.  That is an invite.  Watch when I show up and they're like, ah, you're not on the list.  You're not on the list.  Could you get him out of here, please?  Yeah, but at least it'll make us look cooler to turn you away.  But I was...  That's true.  You need to let me in.  What's up with Corey Hay?  Hi.  What's going on with you?  No, nothing, man.  I'm just thinking...  Didn't you just have a different coffee in your hand?  No, I just finished it here and now I'm onto my Pepsi, sir. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, okay.  A lot of caffeine.  In the morning, man, I got to go do my workout, wake up, frisbee and stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  You know, this guy lost 150 pounds, folks.  Well, 145 pounds in 11 months.  I mean, it's sort of good.  How did you get so big?  Watermelon, cayenne pepper, a certain maple syrup with hot water mixed with lemon and...  No, you asked how you got so big.  I mean, how did you get so big?  That was the fluffer.  Well, my highest was 302, so...  Oh, you...  Wow.  You were 300 pounds.  I was obese. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, for about two weeks.  Two weeks.  You decided to get fat.  11 months ago, I saw Corey for the, well, almost 20th year anniversary of Lost Boys, which  is now in Milton Keynes London for autograph signing, and he saw me normal weight, 280, 285.  Yeah.  You must have seen that anniversary coming up and going, they're going to be calling,  and if I look like this, man, these chicks are going to just be pointing and laughing  at me.  Yeah, but...  They weren't, actually.  They were, like, blocking.  Yeah, he actually got laid anyway.  They were actually...  Fat Corey Haim gets laid?  Absolutely. 
[01:59:00]  You got it.  I'll take it out.  Jesus.  I can't, baby.  No, you know, man, I actually met a really nice girl out there, and she didn't, you know,  look at me for that.  So, she's actually on the show.  Yeah.  She's on the show.  Everything's on the show.  Yeah.  Everything was laid out.  We throw everything in there.  Even the kitchen sink is in the show.  I'll tell you this.  Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels.  And that's for all you people driving to work.  Skinny what?  Skinny what?  Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels.  You're a bumper sticker.  You're just a bumper sticker, huh?  Skinny feels?  Bumper...  See, it means... 
[01:59:30]  Nothing tastes like a chocolate cake would never taste as good as skinny feels.  You're not going to get the satisfaction of being skinny by eating anything.  We have to explain the...  God, they're morons.  I don't ask you normally again.  Dude, they're morons.  They're morons.  Bear with me.  No, we're going to start with our ABCs in a minute.  I'm saying that nothing is worth that feeling of making you fat again.  Oh, my God.  Benny Hanna's Tony Roma's Hard Rock.  Nothing tastes as good as skinny.  It's not Socrates, Jimmy.  Come on.  Just roll with it.  He likes...  Well, you know how when you eat a chocolate cake, how you feel? 
[02:00:00]  Just...  All that.  Like a Wookiee.  Exactly.  Exactly.  You know, one of the...  It's that good?  Skinny feels better and tastes better, man.  I'm just trying to say, like, it outweighs the taste factor.  Outweighs?  Get the pun?  Were you just eating a lot of...  Oh, shablingy-boo.  Thanks, man.  He's pretty punny.  Were you just eating a lot or not working out or both?  He's a pun to go to jail.  I just...  Both, and I just needed...  My head was just almost at that last screw-on point, which I needed a while ago, so I just 
[02:00:30]  took some time.  Which wrong point was that?  Exactly, Corey.  Getting away from you.  It just...  It took me a minute, man.  So that's why I've been in Canada, back in Toronto for about eight, ten years.  Did you see the other guys from the Lost Boys?  We did in Milton Keynes.  Are they here?  No, I'm not here.  Is it a surprise for us?  Oh, my God, look.  You're door number one.  Here they come.  It's the Lost Boys guy.  Let's see.  He knows your crying little sister.  And I'm like, no.  I'll flush back.  That must be a pretty cool and odd, in a way, to see guys from...  You worked with 20 years ago. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, man.  I wonder, like, when you made that movie, you weren't thinking that people were still  going to be watching it.  Yeah, it's great when you see somebody, and they're fat and bald, and you're like,  ha, ha, ha.  No, I'm just joking.  No, you're not.  No, you're not.  It's like the total high school reunion thing.  It's like, ah, look at this dick.  Right.  I still look good.  Ah.  No, I'm just joking.  No, actually.  Is that one of the positive messages?  Yeah, right, exactly.  Hey, you look like crap.  I look good.  Yeah, ha, ha.  Screw you.  The end.  World credits.  So have we accomplished anything with this interview? 
[02:01:30]  I don't even know.  I know.  Well, listen, everyone driving to work or everyone listening, we have a great, great,  great, great show premiering.  I mean, I think it's great.  It's called The Two Corys.  I think Susan did a fabulous job.  Susie's the star of the show, really.  It's called The Two Corys, but it's really about her.  It's really eight episodes of me trying to get a word in.  As you can see.  That's got to be tough.  It's pretty much just like this.  Right.  I'll just sit here.  But she is in Stuff Magazine right now.  Are you?  That's the episode I saw. 
[02:02:00]  The show's on 29, 10 p.m.  Watch it for yourselves, and then I can't get it.  And you just tell me if you enjoy it, and I'll try to get back on the show to click how  many liked it.  That's if we let you in.  That works.  That's if we let you in.  Hey, Corey, you got your head together or what?  Me.  Yes, I'm sorry.  Hi.  You're back there.  He's here.  Well, I'm, you know, it's an everyday wake up, pray to God, thank God I'm alive, man.  So, yes, sir.  Today has already been a good day.  Yeah, you had your problems for many years.  So, oh, man.  Are you still partying, or are you clean and sober?  I'm clean and sober. 
[02:02:30]  My body's actually, I won't do, and it'll reject it.  Wow.  That's handy.  Oh, yeah, it's great.  So did mine last Saturday.  No, my mom says the blessing.  It was awful.  I think that was Sunday morning.  It was rejected.  Yeah.  No, it was Saturday morning after Friday night.  I rejected it in, behind the Escalade.  Literally.  And in the port-a-potty at the show.  Man, you guys are living old school days, huh?  It was horrible.  Wow.  Look, I don't really drink a lot.  That's why I've been out of LA for eight years, man. 
[02:03:00]  It was horrible.  And I'm allergic to liquor, because I go,  I chew a chish.  Really?  You sneeze?  You get hives.  It's like pepper.  Not hives, but like red bugs.  Wait, you're really allergic to beer?  No.  There are people that are allergic to beer.  Oh, no.  He's not really allergic.  He just breaks down the F-ups.  Yeah, he breaks down the F-ups.  Wow.  Obviously, he knows more than my doctor, man.  That's awesome.  How long have you been sober?  He is good for you, man.  How long have you been sober?  Dr. Corey.  Talk to Jimmy there.  How long have you been sober?  Hi, sir.  It's personal, but going over a few years.  Well, it's not that, you know, I'm 20 years old.  No, no.  For me, it's personal, what I'm saying. 
[02:03:30]  So, it's very personal for me.  Jimmy's up to 20.  Jimmy just celebrated 20 years old.  Congratulations, man.  Congratulations.  Congratulations.  Do you still drink at all?  Congratulations on your 20 years.  I never was really a drinker.  No, I'm allergic to alcohol.  Really?  I'm actually allergic to alcohol, so I just can't drink.  That wasn't my thing anyway.  I just don't drink because I don't like it.  You know?  I don't like alcohol.  I don't like it the next day.  I don't like it ever.  As you're doing it.  It's only too early to be talking about this bad past stuff.  I hate the taste of it.  I hate the taste of it.  I hate the smell of it.  Talk about the positive message.  A little ditty about Jack and Diane.  Should we crank something on for the peeps? 
[02:04:00]  Positive and for the future, man.  Hey, well, I wrote a song.  You want to hear my song?  Well, I've heard them all, man.  You know, sure.  I mean, not really.  I wrote a song.  I wrote a song.  I don't really want to.  What's up with the song?  You've always been into music.  What's up with the song?  I wrote an anti-war song, which is pretty cool.  Really?  Yeah.  Years ago.  Which one?  Civil?  It's called Take a Stand.  Mind your business, Lincoln.  And it's on my website, which is available for a free download.  If you go to www.coreyfelvin.net. 
[02:04:30]  And we're promoting the internet.  Who has .com, bro?  Seriously?  Who has it?  Yeah.  You know what?  I actually do have it.  I have both.  Oh, you do?  Okay.  But we set up a brand new website, so we switched everything.  All right.  I was going to say, you get one of those bastards.  It's a squat on your name.  Well, it's kind of like that, but different.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, no.  I had com for years, and then when we tried to switch everything over, they were like,  oh, we're not letting it go.  So then we just used their .com as our search engine, basically, to send everything over  to them. 
[02:05:00]  Jimmy had gay porno on his for a while.  Yes.  Oh, wait.  No.  That was after you got it back.  You did that on purpose.  Oh, waka waka.  Twisted burn, man.  I'm loving it, dude.  It was great burn.  It was all starring me.  Get home safe.  Oh, no.  That's our music.  Ah.  Show's over.  Yeah, the computer shuts off in 30 seconds.  Thank you for having us.  Good morning.  Big plug.  When?  Where?  Sunday.  July 29th at 10 p.m.  on A&E Network.  The two Corys.  Enjoy Corys. 
[02:05:30]  Every Sunday.  It won't be the best show ever, but you just might like it.  I like the fact he was honest about it.  Corys can't wait for his next project.  Good morning.  Have a great day.  Corys can't wait for his next project.  No, the two Corys, Sundays at 10 p.m. on A&E.  Corys Heyman, Corys Feldman.  Thanks for having us, guys.  And Susie Feldman, of course.  Thank you, Corys.  All right.  All right, bro.  Good to meet you, too.  All the 22 million, man.  Thanks, Corys.  All right.  Thanks, Susie.  Thank you.  All right. 
[02:06:00]  Thank you so much.  And there they go.  Thank you.  They go sign some thanks.  I don't know what we accomplished just there.  Susie smells good.  Yeah.  And she smells good?  Yeah.  Pretty attractive.  Yeah.  That girl right there.  That was a funny compliment you gave her.  Well, she's not awful.  What?  She's really beautiful.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I hope he kind of downplayed the prettiness.  Wow.  That sucked.  And there was nothing wrong with her.  Boy. 
[02:06:30]  That sucked.  Oh, boy.  Was that all?  Someone says, they're writing here, lost boys indeed.  They're right, Bob.  Mine, too.  Is Kyle Talk being unkind?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Everybody's being unkind.  Yeah.  All right.  At one point, someone was shouting on the instant feedback.  They wrote, Opie, do something.  I was like, I didn't know where to begin on that one.  Cigars and scotch, they just ruined the new ratings.  I think listening to train wrecks could be fun. 
[02:07:00]  That's all.  You never know.  It just really was a cluster.  For two guys that know each other for 20 some odd years, they really don't have chemistry  as far as when to talk, when to shut up.  They need to get lost again.  Oh, sorry.  You guys kind of talked over each other.  That's all we're getting at.  That's all we're getting at.  They heard everything we just said.  Yes.  We don't really want you to listen to anything either.  You know what it's like when you have an old pro, man.  You just keep ribbing and ribbing and ribbing. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Yeah?  All good.  He's like a parrot on ether, man.  It's awesome.  Yeah.  All right.  They're still talking.  All right.  Why don't we...  We'll be back on XM shortly.  Yeah.  I just want to acknowledge for the people while they're still in the room that that  was awful.  I'd rather listen to Eric's car crash story.  Again.  Yeah, where's Eric?  And then the guy, and then I stood around.  You know, he was one of those awful wash women after talking.  What do you think happened? 
[02:08:00]  What happened there?  One of the people that the injured looks up to see and goes, ugh, he's not here to help.  Anyone else notice that we got out of playing the song?  Yeah.  I'm sure we will.  Uh, hey, uh...  Oh, no, yeah.  I believe XM needs to hear that.  All right.  Maybe we'll continue with that.  I absolutely do.  Oh, wait.  We're not supposed to promote it.  All right.  Shh, shh, shh.  We don't ever go over there.  To New York, thank you so much.  Yes.  We had a great, great ratings book.  Great ratings.  You bastards.  Thank you.  It was very, very nice. 
[02:08:30]  Thank you so much.  Love you.  If you're not joining us over at XM, have a good day.  See you.  Later.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Look, we're back.  To the people that tuned us out for about 20 minutes.  I'm just hoping that was so bad it was good.  That's the only thing you can hope for on that one.  And to the people like, come on, Opie, do something.  Go after these guys. 
[02:09:00]  It wasn't one of those situations.  I don't know what it was.  We were trying to get into the show, which I like.  He was being honest.  No, that's kind of scripted in reality.  I like that.  He wasn't.  Yeah, it was a bit of a train wreck.  Of course, we're talking about the two Corys, Corey Feldman and Corey Haim.  I don't know what the fuck was going on.  Yeah.  Clusterfuck.  It's fine.  Tom came in.  He's like, you know, that was so bad.  It was good.  And I'm like, I'm hoping that people thought that.  Honestly, I don't know what we were supposed to do in that situation.  You know what it's like trying to hold that together?  It is not easy. 
[02:09:30]  I'm whipping out questions out of my ass.  Yeah, but then.  And they just don't answer them.  They're talking amongst each other.  There's inside jokes.  New conversations are being started.  I'm trying to delve into like the beginnings of child stardom to how it is like now.  Like I kind of wanted some coherent child star experience of kind of getting a little too mature at a young age with the chicks and nothing.  You're way better than me. 
[02:10:00]  Nothing.  I asked a few questions and I realized, okay.  All right, well, they don't even know when to stop talking so the other one could talk.  Both engines are on fire.  We're plummeting in.  I'm going to be doing that tomorrow night.  Ops parachuting out of the plane and I'm sticking at the controls.  God bless you.  I'm trying.  At that point, I'm just like talking to the other one just jumps in.  I'm just doing what they were doing.  But God bless you because I was sitting there at that point going, wow, this is just kind of interesting to watch.  I'm just going to sit back and watch.  Yeah.  Susie Feldman wanted attention because she's hot. 
[02:10:30]  So she was babbling over everybody and she had nothing to say.  So the first thing we probably should have done now that we have we've had time to think was to tell us shut the fuck up and just look pretty and smell nice.  And then we should have told Corey Feldman to shut up when Corey Haim was attempting it.  Well, actually, Corey Haim was the whole problem.  He actually wasn't attempting to talk much.  It was impossible for him to talk.  He couldn't put together really any coherent sentence.  Well, there's an old thing like my father would always say when things were happening. 
[02:11:00]  My father would say, too many cooks spoil the broth.  And I'd say, shut up, you old queen.  And we'd laugh.  It's very difficult when you have a very hot girl and then two self-centered asses.  But they were fun guys, man.  I liked them.  They were silly.  They were all all three of them just trying to get attention at the same time.  You know what it is?  And I just sat here and went, wow.  I was trying to bring it up.  They were like the shit back in the 80s. 
[02:11:30]  It was all about them.  I completely understood where you were going.  And I wanted.  You just never got there.  I wanted them to convey a bit of that to us and our audience.  I want it.  It was no getting there.  I want to ask about Michael Jackson because film hung up.  Of course.  Hung out with him in the day.  Yeah, I was like, why bother?  It just couldn't.  We couldn't bring it together.  No matter how many.  Each of us tried at some point.  But no. 
[02:12:00]  So what we got was blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Corey, Corey.  The two Corey's.  Talk to me.  I'm hot.  Talk to me.  I'm hot.  Me, me, me.  I'm hot.  I forgot about that one.  You threw such a backhanded compliment at her, too.  What?  She's not.  What did you say?  No, it wasn't even not bad.  It was worse than that.  No, because Corey Haim was taking a shot at Corey Feldman's wife.  Right.  She's beautiful.  But it didn't work because she's hot.  So maybe what I said didn't come across right. 
[02:12:30]  But you said.  Usually when you go after some dude's chick or any chick in general, there is some kind  of flaw you could kind of go after.  Yeah, it was pretty much you saying something to the effect, though, of you're not bad.  It was like, eh, you're okay.  That was how it came off when you said it.  I was trying to say she's not bad enough for you to be making fun of her.  Oh, she's not that bad.  That's what you said.  Right.  But you meant to say she's not that bad.  Yeah, exactly.  But it came off as, she's not that bad.  No, she's in the latest issue of Stuff Magazine. 
[02:13:00]  She's beautiful.  She's definitely.  Guys will be jacking her on their stuff.  I wouldn't mind taking her out for a malted, excuse my language.  Well, easy now, Jim.  This is XM Satellite Radio.  And I'll tell you what's going on.  I did watch an episode of The Two Quarries.  And I was going to try this, too, but it didn't work.  They're doing something with reality shows where they're actually trying to script them.  Yeah.  It sucks.  Don't do that.  Isn't scripted reality show sitcom? 
[02:13:30]  Well, yeah.  And I'll tell you why they're scripting them now.  Because they don't want to hang out for months on end until they get the good stuff.  So they're trying to force good stuff.  It takes too much time to sit there and film for weeks to come up with an hour of good stuff.  The Hogan family, even though they got another season of that coming out for whatever reason,  I don't know, that one's scripted.  And you could see it.  The real world, when it hit, was great because they hung out for up to six months to get the good stuff. 
[02:14:00]  But especially with celebrities, they don't want to do a reality show for six months.  And it was before they knew.  They want you to film for two weeks, three weeks.  So you've got to script some stuff and hope it kind of looks like you're watching a reality show.  The real world, also at the beginning, they didn't know what it was all about.  So they acted normally.  Right.  Now it's just a matter of, you know, all right, let's cast the gay guy.  We'll cast the obnoxious drunk bitch, the guy that goes after the babes.  So you're not really getting a reality show there either. 
[02:14:30]  The reality show is pretty fucking dead.  Right.  It's dead as dead.  And someone's saying fucking tough guys talking shit when they leave.  I was just thinking that.  That's not true, though.  No, no, no.  But that's what people are going to think.  But that's not true.  All that stuff at the end of the show, they were 10 feet away from us signing stuff.  And we did a little of that when they were here.  We wouldn't have been able to get a word in.  It didn't work.  And what I was doing, I'm not saying it was, I'm not saying like they were awful and they  suck. 
[02:15:00]  I was saying I was trying to get something like, and you heard me, I'm trying to ask  questions about them growing up in Hollywood like that.  And they weren't answering.  This is what people are thinking.  I'm telling you.  After a fight almost happens, you're talking and you're like, I almost kicked that guy's  ass.  Dude, that's one thing.  Oh, now you talk.  Yeah.  But that's.  Yeah.  Okay.  But I think the show has a history of saying uncomfortable things.  Yeah.  When it's deserved.  That wasn't really deserved.  It was more of a trademark.  Tom from Philly said I said there's nothing wrong with her. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, there's nothing wrong with her.  That's it.  Okay.  That is such a backhanded compliment.  There's nothing wrong with her.  Great.  She doesn't have like a bubble on her head or brain damage.  That's a fucker.  Yeah.  But that could have been interesting because Corey Haim was a huge child star.  Yeah.  Made a bunch of movies with Corey Feldman.  And then he went away because he had a massive drug problem.  Right.  Massive.  He was.  You could tell he was a little weird about that because I asked him about being 
[02:16:00]  sober.  That's the only thing he doesn't like talking about because he's burned every  bridge in Hollywood.  So he's like, I really don't want to talk about that anymore.  I mean, it was so bad.  He his weight ballooned up to like 300 pounds, like he said.  Yeah.  That was massive.  He had a massive drug problem.  He's lucky to be alive.  So then the and then, you know, Corey Feldman hung out with Michael Jackson.  And I wanted to hear.  And he had his issues with his dad and stuff that we've seen on some of these  TV shows.  And then the show is kind of cool because Corey Feldman got his shit together. 
[02:16:30]  He's married.  He's living in a mansion and he's still like working in Hollywood.  And he drags his old friend Corey Heyman to live with them.  But then they blew up their own show by saying, oh, I don't believe everything you  say.  Basically, I guess Corey Heyman doesn't live there.  He's living there for the purpose of the show.  Yeah.  And it's scripted and it's positive messages.  And I'm sitting there going, wow, you guys are just selling this show awfully.  Yeah.  Awfully.  Positive messages stink.  Oh, boy.  Who wants a positive message?  In anything. 
[02:17:00]  Not anything you watch.  You're trying to get something positive to just happen in your life.  You don't want to watch it on TV.  I want to see negativity.  I want to see people in worse positions than anyone else I know.  It's a faggoty new way of thinking that everybody has to have a message.  Yeah.  Why?  Why can't you just be funny or interesting without a fucking message?  Let people make their own decisions.  And also, it's being brought up, let's not forget, Corey Heyman had a stroke, too.  We could have talked about that.  We couldn't get anything out of him.  I didn't know that.  Are you shitting me?  Dude, his drug problem was... 
[02:17:30]  Wait, no way.  ...unfucking believable.  Show me the story.  I don't believe that.  I believe he had a stroke, yes.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Are you kidding me?  They showed him on one of the...  I forgot what show it was on VH1 or whatever.  And they showed him kind of just coming out of his drug haze, and it was like, wow, this  guy's been through...  You know what, too?  That is directly related to being a child star, because he was a huge child star.  They loved him.  He was a good little actor and everything. 
[02:18:00]  And then just kind of somehow not getting the parts anymore.  That's always what happens.  And then they freak out, because they're not getting that attention that they had once gotten.  And that's why I would have loved to have gotten an answer there.  He had a stroke?  How did I not know that?  A fan?  August 10th, 2001.  He had a drug-induced stroke, is what I just read online.  So who knows how accurate that is.  He must have...  I'm only going to speculate, but anytime someone's personal about the fact that they're sober, 
[02:18:30]  to me, it means that there might be some kind of a bouncing around with the sobriety date.  Because why else wouldn't you, if you're trying to get back on track, why wouldn't you say,  yeah, I've been sober for two years or four years or whatever it is?  Maybe no one remembered that one, because a month later, maybe some bigger news happened.  Jesus.  Yeah, I don't care.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  His story was brushed under the carpet.  A stroke.  Picked a great time to have a stroke.  Wow.  Oh, it was August of 2001?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  What happened there, E-Rock?  What did you just print up on the board? 
[02:19:00]  Oh, yeah.  Some funny things happened after we got off the air.  What happened?  Corey Feldman refused to sign Derek's movie and threw it.  Why?  Well, we had copies of Lost Boys, and what else did we have over there?  We had License to Drive.  License to Drive.  I was just going to say, Derek, of course, just had to bring the most obnoxious project  that they'd ever been involved with.  Oh, no.  What did he bring?  I didn't sign it.  I think it was, yeah, National Lampoon's Last Resort.  Last Resort? 
[02:19:30]  He looked at this, and he goes, I'm not signing this shit, and he threw it off the table.  Good.  Stupid Derek.  And you know what?  Not that I have to explain, but the reason why I didn't really go after those guys,  I kind of liked them in some bizarre train wreck way.  Because I warned everybody.  I said, everyone get their pictures, because this could get ugly, so you better get your  pictures ahead of time.  But then they were kind of, like, lovable in a strange fucked up way.  They were a little odd, but a little odd.  Oh, my God. 
[02:20:00]  He gave them that.  Derek's brilliant.  Did you see Derek's email the other day about John Levitz?  John Levitz almost got in a fight with, what's his name?  Faggot.  Andy Dick.  Andy Dick.  John Levitz.  You know, the furniture guy.  He beat up Mr. Siemens.  Derek's a fucking dummy, and he probably likes this film because he thinks it's hilarious  and smart comedy.  Like, you fucking smash his toes in the rock. 
[02:20:30]  I brought their best movie.  Yeah.  Dude, this gives me laugh after laugh when I'm depressed.  Iraq?  Faggotty Cuban model shoes.  So they went back to signing the rest of the movies, so I picked it up and kind of slid  it in on the table, trying to help Derek out.  I go, oh, I think you forgot this movie.  And he goes, no, I didn't, and slid it off the table again.  Derek.  Matthew from Ozone Park, Queens.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Oh.  Nice. 
[02:21:00]  I figured.  Yeah, yeah.  Totally figured.  I could just say thank you.  Goodie good.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Guys, why?  The Jews or what?  Nothing.  The Jews.  All right, well, so then they did, we got a song, but you know, that's, if we play the  song now, then we are beating them up when they're not here.  That's true.  No, we're not doing enough time.  We would have played the song, but the thing right now, it was 45. 
[02:21:30]  Remember?  You know.  Absolutely.  Music came up.  I want to hear.  I'm sure it's good.  It's an anti-war song.  I like a song with a message.  Well, I do, but I do take pride in the fact that we do beat up people in front of them.  Yes, we do.  You know, so when that instant feedback, he wasn't too off.  How about this?  CoreyFeldman.net, you can go there, free download.  This is what he wanted promoted.  He requested we play it.  All right.  How about this?  No bad-mouthing the song. 
[02:22:00]  We won't be tough guys when he's not here.  No bad-mouthing the song.  No bad-mouthing the song.  All righty.  Well, or we could just get him back on the phone or something.  That's too easy on the phone.  You don't have to face him.  I'd say only if he's here, we're going to bad-mouth him.  Just give it a spin, as they used to say, Opie.  Remember in the old days when you would give it a spin?  All right, let's do some spinning.  Open mind.  Do a big intro.  No.  Like you're at BAB.  No.  Come on.  This is war in Iraq. 
[02:22:30]  U.S. Army troops say they have control of Saddam here.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Hey, don't say anything, Jimmy.  Your rules.  Don't say anything.  Your rules.  I just want to point out.  Your rules, Jimmy.  This is going to be a struggle.  It's going to be rough.  From piano tinkling number one.  And dramatic war news clips.  Yeah, I like that, though.  It helps it along.  No.  A message of positivity.  No negativity.  You got that right, Buster.  Let's have a little more song. 
[02:23:00]  Because we do take pride in beating them up in front of them.  Yes, we do.  In front of their faces.  This is war in Iraq.  U.S. Army troops say they have control of Saddam Airport just nine miles from Baghdad.  This is living in the area of Baghdad.  It is now less than a mile.  That is how heavy.  This would have a very good singing voice. 
[02:23:30]  Jimmy.  Wait, Jimmy?  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  What did we agree to?  I don't want that instant feedbacker to be right.  You're right.  Okay, I stand corrected.  We had the chance to play this in front of them and make all the comments we wanted.  That's true.  In front of them.  Need something?  Show them.  Don't worry.  Don't worry, Oph.  I got it.  Hey, why is it my machine plugged in? 
[02:24:00]  Motherfucker.  Come on.  What?  Come on, guys.  A little positivity, please, finally.  All right, we're going to back up now again.  I don't want to back up.  Booting, booting.  Please wait.  Please wait.  Please wait.  Why aren't you just playing the song?  Initializing.  Come on.  Okay.  No, we're just going to play the song.  Here we are.  That is now less than a mile.  That is how heavy air has last night. 
[02:24:30]  Wise air.  I'm staring out the window.  Caught inside a dream.  Ignorance is blissful.  I'm feeling quite serene.  Jimmy! 
[02:25:00]  Jimmy!  Jimmy!  We need love somehow  What a horrible  Piece of shit  This movie was  Oh, Last Resort, yeah  What fucking drivel  Right, Last Resort, of course  This movie was  Yeah, yeah  Could be one of the worst movies ever

Oh, I was talking about the movie  What a piece of shit  I want to hear the song  Do we have the actual lyrics of the song somewhere?  Yeah, how about this? How about printing out the words?

[02:42:00]  Toss let rain.  Uh, Eric, what's up?  Apple sauce is what they call my brain.  Toss let rain.  Now what happened with the Corey's IDs?  I hear this is a train wreck, too.  Uh-oh.  What the fuck happens?  Got IDs?  See what these guys gave us?  Um, not only could they not say Opie and Anthony, they were having problems saying their own 
[02:42:30]  names.  Of course.  Um, Corey Haim couldn't take a breath between speaking, so when he was done, he would, like,  just shoot down the soda he was drinking, pull the cup away from his mouth, and just  start rattling again and again.  Why can't he take a breath?  Can we get these guys back in here?  You just wouldn't.  Now I want them back in here.  Cooke's free.  All right, here's the IDs on cut.  Yeah, it's like two minutes, 45 seconds.  Wow.  Do we have an Iron Sheik situation?  Possible, yeah.  Possible? 
[02:43:00]  Pleasure for me.  Dundee.  All right, here's the Corey's, doing IDs.  Oh, foe, Corey Haim, you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Hey, this is my buddy, Corey Thelman.  He's also, wait, what?  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Ha, ha, ha.  But again, this is Corey Haim.  Happy anniversary to the Opie and Anthony show.  Are you recording this?

[02:44:30]  Wow.  Wow.  That's why.  And as I was saying, man, you're listening to my pal, little Jimmy Norton, baby.  Enjoy the day, evening, morning, good morning, good night.  Love ya.  Peace.  Hey, this is Corey Feldman and the other guy, Corey Haim.  And you're listening to my pal, little Jimmy Norton.  Okay.  Hey, this is Corey Feldman, the better of the two Corys, and here's the worst of the two  Corys.  I'm just better looking at the fact. 
[02:45:00]  Corey Haim, that's right.  And you're also listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Sorry, let's just do, why don't we just give you a safety, amen?  Hi.  Hi.  This is the two Corys.

And you're listening to my pal, little Jimmy Norton.  And Corey Feldman.  Peace.  I think the last one should cover you, right?  Wow.  Speaking of out of control drug addicts, Lindsay Lohan arrested again.  Again?  DUI.  No.  Or is this?  She's wearing a thing on her ankle.  Can I tell you something? 
[02:46:30]  I saw this up on the screen for the last, like, half hour.  And I thought it was, uh, this had, I thought this was the old story with her in the, what?  No, this is for the, but she got, is she wearing the thing?  Yeah.  What happened to the thing?  Did she put that alcohol sensor on her leg?  Yep, and they picked her up this morning.  That bitch loves to party.  According to the Santa Monica Police Department, Lindsay Lohan was arrested early Tuesday morning,  that's today, for DUI, uh, driving on a suspended license and possession of narcotics.  Nice.  Um, they say that she apparently had cocaine, or that's what I've heard. 
[02:47:00]  She's currently still in the Santa Monica Police Station.  Bail's been set for 25 grand.  25 G's.  They're saying that cocaine was found in the pockets of her pants.  Her blood alcohol level was apparently between .12 and .13, well over the .08 legal limit.  She's going to do jail time.  Especially at the Paris Hilton, just, uh, uh, oh, it's celebrity gossip.  Now they're going to want to get all that, uh, all the celebrities in jail.  She'll have to.  She'll have to.  I bet you she does, uh, she gets six months in jail, I bet you, because she had drugs.  Six months?  Yeah, because she had drugs. 
[02:47:30]  And she's DUI on a suspended license.  Nice.  With Paris DUI on the suspended license?  Why do they?  She's doing everything Paris does.  Yeah, why do they have to, like, keep upping each other?  That's what's going on here.  Oh.  I was going right for his face.  Remember she came up.  I love throwing paper at E-Rock.  Remember, uh, Lindsay was in the XM studio briefly that day?  Yes.  Yeah, we met her.  Got her shoulder looking like shit.  Yeah, she didn't look that good that day.  Fucked her.  Razzle dazzle.  Oh, he caught it.  Oh, you catch kind of weird, though. 
[02:48:00]  Like a girl.  Yeah, throw something out at E-Rock again.  Not right.  Whenever you say you want him to catch, he just automatically gets on his back and lifts  his legs.  Watch how E-Rock catches, Jimmy.  Nothing.  Watch.  I didn't hear.  Something about it, man.  Really faggy.  It looks like the way you would, a fucking, a game would catch something, like, on a screen.  Like, you hit the controller and the little game arms come out.  No.  Catch is like a video game character, yeah.  Oh, he's trying to be cool now.  Dude, you're not cool.  All right.  That's right. 
[02:48:30]  Enough playing catch on the air.  All right, we'll break and, uh...  And I have a very special announcement when I come back.  No, you don't.  I do.  No, you don't.  And it has nothing to do with my Barnes & Noble book signing this Thursday at 7.30  on Old Country Road in Long Island.  Yes.  I'm also hearing...  Oh, no.  What are you hearing?  We have eight new studio update photos to look at today.  Oh.  After the break.  Well, there better be some...  Major update?  Better be some...  A-Rock's calling it a major update!  Well, then it's gotta be.  Are you trying to say that we might be doing the walkover sooner than later? 
[02:49:00]  Possible.  No way.  All right, major update next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  What the hell's going on here? 
[02:49:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Awful.  Awful.  Awful.  Awful.  They're just awful.  Awful people.  You gotta fight for your ride to party!  Sure words were never spoken.  Wow.  Thank you, Jimmy.  That's all over the news, this Lindsay Lohan thing.  God damn.  Lindsay Lohan. 
[02:50:00]  What a dummy.  I don't hire a driver, you fucking dope.  What a...  What a...  What a...  What a...  What a jerk.  They were showing her pictures of her in a little bikini, and she's got this huge ankle  bracelet on that's supposed to detect alcohol or some crap like that.  DUI after car chase.  Car chase.  Nice.  And they found cocaine in her pants, way over the legal limit, alcohol-wise.  Wouldn't you throw the cocaine out while you're driving? 
[02:50:30]  Snort it out of it.  No, you know what it is about cocaine?  You just...  You don't throw it out.  Or eat it.  You always think maybe you'll make it.  You know how this ends.  If I make it and I have thrown this out, I'll be angry with myself.  True.  You know how this ends?  One of these broads has to die.  Yeah, that'll be the topper.  Because they're trying to just top each other.  Yeah.  You know, and for the most part, they know they could get out of it.  Just pull a Marilyn.  Elton could write a song about what a whore you were.  Yeah.  Right.  You really think she's going to get six months, Jimmy? 
[02:51:00]  In a way, I do, yeah, because I think she won't do six months.  I think she'll do two months.  But yes, because she's so flagrant about it.  And if there's cocaine involved, yeah.  Paris Elton didn't have drugs.  She got busted DUI or whatever on the fucking revoke list.  But now she's doing it, and she's been in more trouble.  You know, she just doesn't have the love in her life, I think.  I know.  I'd like to give it to her.  I think there's not somebody in her life that could take care of her.  Let me read the update for everybody. 
[02:51:30]  Lindsay Lohan was released from a Santa Monica jail just minutes ago after her arrest early this morning.  Breitbart News.  That was the organization that had fun with us.  They're getting some legs, that one, huh?  What is it?  Breitbart?  Breitbart.  The worst name.  I, Breitbart.  Or is it Breitbart?  How do you say this stupid name?  Something Juden.  It's B-R-E-I-T-B-A-R-T News.  Says that cocaine was found in her pockets as she was being processed after her DUI.  Oopsie.  She was probably like, I hope this don't get found. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, they found it.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  This is just saying Chris from Queens.  Very good, Chris.  CW11 here in New York covering this story by showing only a map of Columbia.  That's really funny.  Chocolate rain.  Lindsay's asshole blood goes down the drain.  And chocolate rain.  Yeah.  They found in her pockets some cocaine.  Chocolate rain. 
[02:52:30]  What's happening with Michael Vick?  This dumb motherfucker.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Oh, oh, oh.  So they found the coke.  She was initially pulled over because she was chasing another car in her white Denali.  It is not known who she was chasing or why.  What the fuck, man?  The sheriff's deputies conducted a field sobriety test and Lindsay failed.  She was then brought to the station and booked.  Sources say she was visibly upset but cooperative during her stay.  Must have been a chick cop.  Why?  Guy cop. 
[02:53:00]  You fuck that.  And then you let her go.  That's how you roll.  She might be.  Yeah, but she might want to bust her a little spoiled brat.  No.  Liddy rules.  You just do that.  Suck that cuck.  Liddy rules.  He has the inside scoop.  This only happened because the black helicopter was chasing her and she had to return home  to stir the sauce.  Of course.  Of course.  It all makes sense now.  Yeah, she just doesn't know when to fucking quit.  Get all the coke and booze you want but, you know, have someone drive you around maybe. 
[02:53:30]  Nah, they're just trying to top each other.  They want to get caught.  I truly believe it.  Yeah, they're just addicted to those flashbulbs.  Wow, wow.  She looks hot in her mugshot, though.  That's her mugshot?  Yeah, give her that much.  She looks much better as a blonde than a redhead.  TMZ.com, you can see the mugshot.  I like her raven haired.  Wow, she looks like a porn girl, I know.  A lot in that blonde haired shot.  Really?  She'll probably be doing porn within a few years. 
[02:54:00]  She's down to her nice coke weight.  Yeah.  She looks good.  Got some good coke weight.  Just before she turns skank.  Oh my gosh, she was supposed to do Jay Leno tonight, too.  Really?  She should still do Jay Leno tonight.  It says, not tonight, Lindsay.  Lindsay Lohan was scheduled to do the Tonight Show this evening, but we're guessing that's  not going to happen because she has the right to remain silent.  I'm guessing.  Oh, probably because they would want to ask her about it.  And you know Jay.  Talks.  We love Jay.  Jay is trying to make that happen. 
[02:54:30]  Are you kidding me?  I shouldn't be.  I won't ask you about it.  Just come on the show and we'll have some fun.  It'll be great.  No.  I can't talk.  You know she can't talk because if she says anything about it, they'll use it against her  in court.  I'm just such a dummy, though, because E-Rock puts this up on the screen.  I'm like, oh, that old news.  Oh, they did find cocaine in her blood.  All right.  Whatever.  We won't even mention this because we probably should have already.  And then it's a whole new story.  Hey, before Michael Vick, Jimmy, because we promised the people the update on the studio. 
[02:55:00]  Is that all right?  We got eight new pictures.  There's not much.  There's nothing.  Actually, there's no Michael Vick up there.  I thought he was making a statement.  Oh, really?  Now I'm looking at this fucking Connecticut home invasion where a mother and two daughters  were killed.  Oh, I know.  I want to see the suspects.  Yeah.  Is that one?  What's that story about?  A nice little home invasion.  Came into the house, killed a doctor's wife and two daughters, and then set the house on  fire to try to cover it up.  Where was the doctor? 
[02:55:30]  And I believe he was in the home, too.  But they didn't kill him.  Why?  I could be wrong.  I'm getting like, you know, it's a very fluid story.  All right.  You know what's going on there.  He's alive?  The doctor's alive?  I don't know.  Well, he is a little alive, yes.  Maybe he was shot and he's alive.  Who knows?  Give me some info.  Something smells fishy with this one.  A little fishy?  Might have been in the house, though.  Something smells fishy with this one.  Might have been in the house.  What part of Connecticut?  But if they arrested two people and now they're being held on $15 million bail. 
[02:56:00]  Well, yeah.  You pay people, man.  Maybe the guy paid some people.  Who knows?  I want to know.  I want more info.  The man was able to escape with injuries is what...  What kind of injuries, though?  Some people know where to, you know, do their injuries.  Fucking...  Why do you shoot the wife and two daughters?  I don't know.  Something's up.  Give me the...  You're already implicating the husband?  I did not implicate anyone.  I'm just saying it's maybe...  I don't know.  Maybe it's something going on. 
[02:56:30]  I don't know.  I'm just saying.  If he's alive and the rest of the family's dead, that's a bit suspicious.  That's all.  God, how awful.  You can't defend your family like that.  That's fucking...  Horrific.  That's nasty.  All right, let's get the eight new studio update photos.  E to the rock.  All right.  What's that cleavage doing?  More cleavage.  Hey, look.  I'm not going to complain.  No argument.  But we really got to do a show for everybody.  Here are the latest...  What is that?  Wait, E-Rock. 
[02:57:00]  What's that?  What the hell?  That is where Anthony would be sitting in the studio.  Oh, that's my view.  Looking towards the producer window.  What?  Okay, yes.  I know where that is.  That's where Anthony normally is.  Oh, okay.  So basically what we're seeing is a picture here with a lot of stuff in the old studio.  The ladders are gone.  We had eight boxes yesterday, but now it's just a lot of stuff.  Is the chair gone?  That I don't know.  Actually, no.  It's moved to where Mars' new desk is going to be. 
[02:57:30]  So he has your chair.  No, I meant the chair that was sitting in the studio.  That was...  Oh, okay.  It was mine.  Yeah, good.  I want a new chair anyway.  Okay.  And what are all those boxes?  The floor's gone.  Yep.  They scraped up the floor.  The ceiling, the lighting, the walls, all gone.  The wall's right there.  It's the same place it was.  The padding all...  That was...  When's that coming out?  No, they're going to take that out next.  All right, keep going.  I like this.  Whoa, that's a lot of... 
[02:58:00]  Well, there's roll-away little dumpsters.  Completely filled with metal.  With scrap metal.  All of a sudden, you see in the background a big dog and a Welcome Howard sign.  Howard who?  That's all ceiling stuff.  Okay, very good.  Wow, okay.  Working now.  Where's this?  This would be where the guy from Frank's place would be sitting.  Where his desk was.  Looking out. 
[02:58:30]  Fucking garbage can.  Oh, my God.  All right.  I've done some work.  Full speed ahead.  This is full speed ahead.  Keep going.  Holy shit.  I don't even recognize the place.  That's the whole outer office going towards the windows.  Right, right, right.  The outside windows, right?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Okay, well, we could be doing the walkover in, I say, eight months.  See, Lou in Philly.  Opie on crack.  Lindsay Lohan looks like crap.  What?  No, she doesn't. 
[02:59:00]  Go to TMZ.com.  That's a fine, fine mug shot.  You know, any of these guys that look at girls that are even, in someone's opinion, pretty  hot.  Like, I'm not talking about something that's unanimously a pig.  I'm talking about, like, Lindsay Lohan.  She's fucking hot.  Like, a lot of guys think she's hot.  These guys that go, oh, dude, she's a fucking pig.  Show me what you're fucking.  You stupid dick.  I'm not defending Lindsay Lohan, mind you.  I'm just saying that. 
[02:59:30]  I don't need to explain myself.  That's a hot picture.  And you know what?  I like natural beauty over a lot of makeup.  So, there you go.  She looks like fucking a porn star, though.  She looks beautiful, man.  She's going to be a porn star.  Look up Angela Stone.  She does squirting videos.  I like them a little messy, too, man.  What's wrong with that?  Alcohol monitor.  If you're wearing an alcohol monitor at 21 years old, you're fucked.  Oh, my God.  She is something.  All right, these pictures are good.  What else can you show us?  I know this is more of a visual. 
[03:00:00]  Wow, where's all that from?  A lot of concrete.  There's a big pile of what used to be walls and the ceiling going up to the next floor.  You could see the next floor?  No, they got it to the very middle.  Oh, all the way to the top, yeah, because those were dropped ceilings.  Cool, what else?  Fuck, dude, they're on their way.  Oh, heavy tools.  I see heavy tools.  I see a reciprocating saw.  Yep.  What else?  And a drill.  I think that's it.  And some sheers.  And that's what it used to look like.  God, that was kind of sad to see the old joint all put together again. 
[03:00:30]  No.  It would be nice to move on and have a fine place to broadcast from.  All right, moving on.  This is a hot mug shot.  I'm going to give her that.  Oh, I didn't mean E-Rock when I said that's a heavy tool.  That's funny.  Poor E-Rock.  You saw someone die.  I know.  No, he didn't.  Give me my $20.  I'm getting information.  Give me my $20.  No.  And where's my bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet clip?  We bet because E-Rock said he saw somebody get killed this morning. 
[03:01:00]  E, I need my bet, bet, bet, bet clip.  Some guy walked out into the street, got hit by some kind of minivan.  The guy's face smashed the windshield.  He flew into the road.  And his hat came off.  And everybody was laughing as his hat was getting run over by various cars.  And then 10 minutes later, the ambulance came, put him in, and E-Rock said they saw him cover him up with a sheet, but not his face.  Now, here's what I'm saying.  If it was a fatality and he was dead on the scene, they would have left him there and investigated, done an investigation. 
[03:01:30]  If he was alive, they put him in the ambulance and rush him to the hospital, which is apparently what they did.  He may be dead now.  He might have been, you know, almost dead.  I didn't go with dead on the scene, by the way.  I'm still saying I think he's alive.  This caused his death.  I don't think so.  That was me. 
[03:02:00]  Friday night.  No kidding.  So I want to bet $20.  $20 whole dollars.  That I say this guy ain't dead.  So I have some calls in to various contacts that might be able to get that information.  Where was it, E-Rock?  I say dead.  42nd and 9th.  42nd and 9th.  Yeah.  At about 9 p.m.  Yeah, a little after.  Yeah.  Last night.  Oof.  Who the fuck is that? 
[03:02:30]  Oh, this is hilarious.  What is this, a smoking gun?  Yeah.  Sorry, E-Rock, you know, he surfs all morning long and every once in a while you definitely  distract us in a good way.  It's going to jail in your favorite team color.  They have a whole montage.  Of just mug shots with people in jerseys.  Yeah, what jersey is that?  That would be the Bears?  Anyone?  Oh, Steelers, okay.  Number 87?  Steelers.  No, it was, well, it was from the shoulders.  I'm sorry.  Let's continue. 
[03:03:00]  Some older chick.  What is that?  I don't know.  It looks like a WNBA.  I don't know.  Where does it go up?  All right, this ain't going to go anywhere.  No.  It's funny, though.  Go to smoking gun.  Right.  One more.  One more.  Oh, my God.  Why don't we move on?  He looks like the fucking, he looks like the 18-year-old ruler of some shitbox nation.  That one guy.  The fucking, the skinny ruler who inherited it. 
[03:03:30]  All right.  I want details on that, on that thing.  Fuck you, man.  On the invasion.  Why?  Oh, sorry.  Not you, Jimmy.  Tim from Colorado.  Tim, go ahead.  Hey, I'm a paramedic in Colorado, and that guy's not dead.  They just come in love with a sheet, because they're trying to keep him warm from going  into shock.  Right.  What if he, but it was nice out last night.  Yeah.  It was like, do you still cover someone up when they've been like that?  I want confirmation.  Let's say hi to Mike in Connecticut.  Mike.  Yo, what's going on, boys?  Hey there, Mike. 
[03:04:00]  Jim, you rock, man.  I just want to let you know you guys are fucking awesome, but I wanted to give you an update  on that story in Cheshire.  Yeah, that's the Connecticut home invasion, yes.  Yeah.  The two scumbags broke into the house, and they forced the guy at gunpoint to go to the  bank and take out the money.  And when he was at the bank with the one guy, the other guy tied up his wife and two teenage  daughters and killed him, brought him back to the house, roughed him up, and then  tried to set it on fire.  And then a teller saw something like she thought was suspicious and called the cops. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah, the teller saw something, and they brought the cops back to the house, and the  guys tried to ram the cop cars and shit as they tried to get away.  Guys are total jerk-offs, man.  But wait, so how did the husband escape?  They obviously brought him back knowing they were going to kill him.  Yeah, they brought him back, and what happened was they tied him up, and they started slapping  him around, but when they saw the cop cars outside, you know, they got a little antsy  and then set the house on fire, so they left, and they left him inside to burn, and another  cop ran in and saved him, but the wife and two daughters were already dead. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, wow.  My question is, why did they just slap him around and not shoot him?  I don't know.  I mean, I'm sure he wishes he had been shot at this point to have, lose your whole family  like that.  Well, yeah.  What do you know about the suspects?  Can you tell, have you seen them?  They still haven't released any photos yet.  You know, we're still, you know, everyone is waiting, but they still haven't released  any photos because the town, you know, it is a small town, so they're saying they're  just waiting, and then they're going to release them at some point today or tomorrow is the 
[03:05:30]  last I heard.  I'll take ten bucks on that.  I'll bet ten.  Ten?  I'll bet ten.  I ain't betting.  Well?  I ain't taking your money.  I mean, I ain't, like, betting your, we're betting the same.  I bet ten.  I'll bet, uh, 20.  I'm talking a thousand.  Anybody taking any action?  We can't even get action on this bet, Jimmy.  No, you can't.  No, no.  Bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, 
[03:06:00]  bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet.  Well, you guys are awesome, thanks, man.  Alright, thanks for the update, bro.  Alright, peace.  You won't get action on that one.  You're right, I won't.  Alright, why don't we  How about we talk about this  Obese girls are much less likely  To attend college  Well, that makes sense  Why does it? 
[03:06:30]  Let me try to think  Why if a girl is fat  Would she  Not attend college  Because  She can't get out of the house in the morning  Because she's eating  That could be it, late for school  Or maybe  Maybe  There's so many things  Rushing to my head, none of them amusing  Now we all know fat chicks 
[03:07:00]  They give good head  So she might have been doing that behind the school  Instead of studying  To make friends  Because no one wants to be friends with a fat girl  Unless she's sucking cock  I'm just  I'm just thinking aloud here  Alright, think it out  You are good with stats by the way  That could be it  Fat chick  Not in college  Let's see 
[03:07:30]  If your parents  Cared about you  Enough to have money  For you to go to school  They would care for you enough  To not let you become  A slob  Is that it?  That's probably it  That's what I'm going with  I'm going with the parents  Of a fat kid  Don't care about them  Or they  They don't discipline them enough  To where they're eating well  And maybe going to school 
[03:08:00]  No, that's not it  No, Jim?  Because your test scores  Are not good enough  Because the machine  Can't read your SATs  Because the fudge  On your fat fingers  Keeps marking up  The wrong spots  So it looks like  You only scored  A 27  On your SATs  There's no such thing  As number two fudge  It's just your big  Dumb chocolatey fingers  As you're  You're so nervous  That you're just  Barehanding a fucking  Hershey's bar  And touching the paper  Paper touch  Paper touch  Paper touch  Fudge fingers 
[03:08:30]  Fudge fingers  Take the  Take the wig has one  Because they don't want  To be taken to  Opie's frat house  And have their dump  Picked up by him  In a homoerotic initiation  Ah  A little embarrassed  By their  Chubbiness  Or maybe because  There's a  It's hard to find  A college  With a barn next to it  So they can set up  Their sorority  After tracking  11,000  American adolescents  A study released  Monday found  The following  Secondary school  Obese girls 
[03:09:00]  In the US  Were half as likely  To enroll in college  Versus their  Non-obese peers  Peers  Hey  I got some  Inside info  I'll take both  Your bets  Both bets  Oh yeah  Okay  Uh oh  I see a name  That uh  What happened  Has a lot  Of consonants  In it  Yeah  Hmm  Yeah  What 
[03:09:30]  I don't know  It's just updated  But it doesn't  The names of the suspects  You sure  Uh possibly  Russians  25 year old male  From uh  From that town  Joshua  Komisar  Komisar  Komisar  Komisar  Komisar  Komisar  Komisar  Komisar  Is a ski in there  Uh there's a  There's a big ski  In there  Hmm  Can't confirm that  Obviously  But there you go  And then someone else  Is realizing that  The show is running  Out of steam  And he's pointing us  Toward a bit  What 
[03:10:00]  No  We were just doing  A great chocolate rain  Bit minutes ago  Yeah we're talking about  Fat girls  And why they don't  Go to college  Because they don't  Deserve to learn  We come  What is there to learn  Nobody wants to listen  To a fat girl  No matter what  She's talking about  That's the problem  Did you know  That no one cares  Fatty  You know  The way to cure cancer  No one cares  Shut up  Go eat  Eat more 
[03:10:30]  Uh  What do you got Jared  Jared  What are you bringing in  Microphone  Don't just yell  To space  Go over there  I'm trying to find  Something  Town reels  Bringing in a copy  Of the instant feedback  Ugh  Why that  Cause we were supposed  To update every so often  Yeah but  Alright  Oh wait  Now I'm going  The wrong way  Wow  I'm going the wrong way  Nasty people 
[03:11:00]  Alright we're gonna take a break  We're gonna regroup  I'm trying to find something  I'm sorry  What are you looking for pumpkin  I gotta find it  It's Opie and Anthony  It's the Opie and Anthony show  Ah we're back  Let's not forget  Jimmy's gonna be doing  A book signing  This Thursday  Out there on Long Island  Yes my neck of the woods  What  What about my neck of the woods  And we're off the next day too  So uh  Oh  We can stay out late 
[03:11:30]  Yeah  This Thursday  26  Barnes and Nobles  According to  Clubs  Sodas  Kennys  I will be doing a signing  It's on  Carlisle  Uh  Carlway  Carl  No  It's on Old Country Road  In Carl Place  Old Country Road  Just remember  Old Cunt  Old Cunt Road  Yes  Carl Place  There you go  In uh  In uh  Long Island  I will be doing the Barnes and Noble  730  I'm shooting something for Fuse earlier  So we had to move the book signing  To 730 
[03:12:00]  Oh look at you  Um  But Long Island  Is such a great market for us  Yes  I didn't have the books at Jones Beach  To sign  So I want to do  A signing in Long Island  So we're  I'm stopping and visiting  Your signing  I hope so  Close to me  And then maybe we can go back to my house  For some coffee and cake  I'd like that  And what I'd also like to say  Is Anthony will be bringing some of that 100k  And handing it out  To whoever buys the most books  In  Bunches  And Long Island gave us great ratings 
[03:12:30]  So  Fucking amazing  Thank you Long Island  I love Long Island  Thank you New York  But then again we're not talking to those people  Those are the cheap people  No they're still listening  Maybe they do both  I'm hoping  Maybe they have XM at home  Or something  How about you just leave the station on in the background  That's all  With the volume down  Yeah  Whatever  Do something  Will ya  Yeah  Be active  Why must I cry  Support your local show  I don't know what this is about  But let me hear 45 seconds of this  Why must I cry  Damn thing  Aw  Doesn't have the same feel as Chocolate Rain 
[03:13:00]  No  Black guy in the shower  Kind of  Ew  He's wiping his butt with the soap right there 
[03:13:30]  What is he doing and why  He's in the shower  I got one reason why he must cry  Yes  And one why we do when we steal  Is he retarded or deaf  He has something wrong with him right  Sure  I don't know man  Just a singing voice  No  Tell me why  Yeah  Then why would he be driving Jimmy  I don't know  Explain that one  Deaf people drive  Oh  Ding fries are done 
[03:14:00]  Why must I cry  Ding fries are done  Oh he doesn't have any teeth  Or something  He's got a grill  He's got a grill  He's got a grill  Yeah  Gold Toofers  Alright why the soap in the shower  And he's washing  Alright I don't even get this  No it's  Everyone out there is trying to find the next you know  Chocolate ring  Yeah  We're in search of the next chocolate ring 
[03:14:30]  Chocolate ring  He says do that again  He says chocolate  Chocolate ring  Chocolate  I never noticed how well he pronounced chocolate  Chocolate  Rain  Rain  Most of us just say chocolate rain  And you kind of let it become a  Chocolate  Not this guy  He fucking is a Mr. Pronunciation  That's why Steve probably likes it  I'd like some chocolate  Alright I got something serious  Because you guys got your iPhone  Something that you should know  What?  If this is about that fucking bullshit  Oh it's bullshit 
[03:15:00]  It is bullshit  It can't happen  It can't happen  The hack  It can't happen  That's a hack  Speaking of which  Hack hack  I called Voss last night  Is he a father or what?  Yeah today  It was supposed to happen yesterday  Take it out  There's something about taxes  It's teeth got stuck  They can't find the little fella  Yeah maybe  Alright  No it's not the hacking thing  No?  It's more widespread  Oh sweet  If you power down your cell phone 
[03:15:30]  There's no way the government could ever hear you  Certainly not the FBI  It's turned off right  Have we got news for you  Oh no  Alright here's that cell phone story you've been waiting for  Cell phone users beware  Big brother may be listening  The Federal Bureau of Investigation can now hear everything you say  Even when the cell phone is turned off  I know it sounds kind of out there  But using your phone's tracking device  Authorities can now activate the microphone inside the dreaded thing 
[03:16:00]  Allowing them to eavesdrop on you and your conversations  It's serious business  And the FBI used this form of surveillance  To keep tabs on critical conversations  By people they call known members of the mafia  Experts say the only way around it  Is to take the battery out of the thing  Yeah I knew this was going on  Go ahead let him  Who cares  Hey leave the mafia alone  You go after Al Qaeda with this  Yeah  That's it  I just don't  They used to listen to like mafia dudes talking this way  I don't know  What are you asking me 
[03:16:30]  I don't know nothing  I never heard of this  I don't know what you're talking about  Every Italian knows something about the mafia  I don't know one person  That you even quit talking about  I don't know what situation it was  You've told me many times  That you and the police regularly have conversations  About who's doing what  Never said a word  You're already told us  Calling me a rat  Calling me a rat  You already told us  Your real name's not Anthony Comey  Yes  That's what happened  I was doing mafia work in Arizona  And they relocated me here to New York City  And gave me an Italian name 
[03:17:00]  Good point  Good point  Let me say something  Do you know the court order you have to have to pull this off  Big deal  Oh my god  If you get a court order  It's like wiretapping anything else  Good  They probably use it on terrorists too  Nice that the news blew it up  Dude  Yeah  Fucking cunt  I'm sure we've talked about this from time to time  But maybe someone out there is going to hear this for the first time  But when Ant and I were working at AF in Boston  The fucking GM was eavesdropping on us all the time  Yep  And that's how he was able to keep us down  He was able to dial a phone number 
[03:17:30]  And even when the mics were off  Listened to everything that was being said in the studio  So he didn't even have to be in his office  Or like in a production room or something  From his car phone  He would dial this number  And you would be able to hear everything that was going on  When the mics were off  We were so angered by this  Because we were strategizing  How we were going to try to get more money from the guy  Because we were both making nothing  Well when we found out what the number was  And how to then go into the closet  And pull the plug 
[03:18:00]  Right  To pull the microphone offline  So he couldn't hear us  We were so angered by this  What we did was after the show  We'd plug it back in  Dial and listen to what Rocco was saying  The guy that came on after us  It was fantastic  You really get to hear a lot of crazy shit  We were outraged at this invasion of privacy  So much so  That we used it against the show  That came on after us  Against someone else  And we knew how to disable it  Which was very handy  Because we used to talk smack about the boss 
[03:18:30]  Smack as they say  Smack I tell ya  Is Rocco doing well in the business right now?  I don't know  I think I'm selling cars dude  We don't know what's going on  I haven't heard hide nor hair about Rocco  I hear about John Osterland  Ozone from up in Boston  Our old days  He's in Florida  Yep  That's what I hear  Do you still hate Rocco?  I'd like to see him  Nah too much time has passed  I could give a flying fuck about him  Nah that was all just fake shit  To get our ratings up  It was all fake  Would you help him get a job now?  Oh we have  It's great  We're best of friends 
[03:19:00]  Yeah  I don't know  It's a Dave Douglas too  One of my favorites  Who?  Dave Dickless  You could do that with a PBX phone system  If you program it correctly  A PBX?  Yeah  I didn't know that  I have one right here  Alright  It's a PBX  And then finally this before line of the day  Okay  Deathly Hallows is vanishing out of stores in record numbers  In book number seven's first day  More than 2.6 million copies were sold in the UK alone 
[03:19:30]  Here in the US  A staggering 8 million books were sold in just  Wait a minute  She sold 8.3 or whatever here and another 2.5, 2.6 over there  Holy Jesus  I thought the 8.3 was for the world  Do you understand?  Holy shit  She's approaching happy ending numbers  And it's starting to bother  Close  She's closing in on your numbers  I sold 9 million here  6.2 in the UK 
[03:20:00]  Right  UK being the University of Connecticut  With a K  Kentucky  Ah, Jimmy  Chocolate rain  Chocolate rain  Gets me out of a bomb again  No, it doesn't  No  Cause I  Cause then the bun has to be pushed to get you out of it  And uh  It's just not happening that time  But I was making  High  Fly  Wall  Repeat 
[03:20:30]  To left center field  It's way back  It may be playable  Can't get a play  It's gone  A home run  Oh, he caught it  He caught it at the wall  I was unsure  He was unable to reach it  I fought for sure  Good  Good for Bob Murphy  Uh  Here's  Bob Murphy  Harry Potter  8 million books were sold  In just 24 hours  But some local readers are left disenchanted  By their copies of the Deathly Hallows  For them, the page turner hit a speed bump 
[03:21:00]  At the height of the action  Some copies sold at the Barnes & Noble in Moorestown  Were printed without a chunk of pages  Spellbound by the story  Fans were disappointed to find 30 pages missing  In the final chapters  He disappeared  Oh, I could have cried  He freaked out  It was right at the climax  My husband's waiting for me to finish this  And I get there  And I can't finish this book  In a statement  Harry Potter's U.S. publisher  Scholastic says 
[03:21:30]  Quote  Printing and distributing 12 million copies of a book  Is a Herculean task  And it is not surprising at all  That some would have printing errors  What is surprising  Is that so far  We have learned of only 21 books without printing errors  Scholastic has pledged to replace defective copies  Only 21 without printing errors  Without printing errors?  Wow  Out of the fucking 10 million sold  Only 21 were good  You fucking mush-mouthed idiot  They certainly wanted to get those out 
[03:22:00]  Yeah, they did  Ah, fuck it  Look, you spelled it wrong  It's Harry Pitter  Just send it out  We have a deadline  Harry Pitter  This is fucking Harry Potter  This is the game Kaplan  Send it out  Oh my god  It's about a kid that writes  Harry Jotter  Where are you going?

[03:23:00]  That's what you do  That's right  Potter  Jesus Christ  Nobody wants to read  About the Iranian president  If he were a wizard  Bonnie Snotter  Who's going to buy that?  Wow  Jotter  Potter  Water  Water  Oh my god  A thirsty wizard  Harry Water  I know these things  And I don't care  I have a fucking erection  For no reason  Water  Sotter  Potter  Water  Water  Did that one?
