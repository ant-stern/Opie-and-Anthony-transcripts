<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly between planned segments and impromptu discussions.  The show began with the hosts expressing frustration over workplace issues, particularly the stalled implementation of a "Whip Em Out Wednesday" (WOW) hotline designed to receive reports of women flashing listeners.  This was followed by a discussion mocking a previous dating expert guest and devolved into jokes about inappropriate sexual encounters.  A lengthy, rambling call from "Russell," a trucker from Knoxville (possibly Birmingham), dominated a significant portion of the early show.  Russell's conversation was characterized by offensive language, nonsensical tangents, references to Hurricane Katrina's aftermath, racial slurs, and disturbing comments about nursing home deaths.

The show then shifted gears to a comedic segment featuring audio clips of comedian Bill Burr interviewing bands at Ozzfest, prompting them to create impromptu, profanity-laced PSAs on skin cancer and domestic violence.  Bill Burr, who filled in for Jim Norton on a previous occasion, was mentioned again as a guest who appeared in studio, discussing his recent HBO special, a segment of which caused one host's wife to call him to bed (though he ignored her).  The show struggled to locate a functional phone number for the WOW hotline, and concluded the early portion with speculation about Hurricane Rita's impact.  Robert Eatman was briefly mentioned in an anecdote involving Opie.

Later segments included planning for a "Love Connection"-style segment featuring Big A and "Stalker Patty," which would be recorded in audio and video.  The escalating rivalry between Harry (an O&A producer and stand-up comedian) and Nathaniel (a producer for Ron and Fez) was a significant focus. This involved a planned comedy "joke-off," with potential consequences ranging from leaving their respective radio jobs to leaving XM entirely.  Audio clips from Ron and Fez detailing the competition were played, along with several clips of Harry's stand-up material, which frequently included political satire and utilized PowerPoint presentations, short films, and photoshopped images.  The show also included calls from listeners, including Peter from New Jersey who requested a clip from *The Devil's Advocate*.  Conversations touched upon Al Pacino and Tom Cruise's acting abilities, and the relationship between Spielberg and Cruise.  The show concluded this section with a discussion about breakfast choices for radio hosts and a personal anecdote from Opie about getting lost overnight while hiking.  The unexpected appearance of Levon Helm's band playing live in the studio was also noted.

A section focused on frightening wildlife encounters, featuring personal anecdotes from Opie (a near-death experience in a rip current and a bear sighting) and caller accounts of dangerous situations in Alaska.  This was followed by listener-submitted movie trailers for a fictional Opie and Anthony film, along with a scathing critique of a Tara Reid reality show.  Rich Voss and his wife Bonnie, scheduled guests, did not appear.  A recurring bit involving a character named Ramon was briefly explained by a caller.

Another segment started with a discussion about internal flatulence, leading to conversations about intestinal anatomy and a story from Opie about unexpectedly blowing a smoke ring after an "inside fart".  Further discussions included Hurricane Rita, Barry Bonds hitting a home run, and the start of the hockey season.  A Gamefly.com advertisement aired, and Tara Reid called in, engaging in a rambling conversation.  A "Ripple Mal Wednesday" jingle was repeated, a musical segment played, and a promotion for "wow stickers" was aired.  The conversation returned to Hurricane Rita, leading to a humorous recap of the plot of *Jaws: The Revenge*, including discussion of a listener's email about a T-Rex-like sound from the shark in *Jaws 4*.  A significant portion was dedicated to playing and discussing "Little Marky" audio clips, religiously-themed vignettes, including one about an unborn child's perspective on abortion; a caller then asked the offensive question: "Did Jesus make the niggers?".  The segment concluded with humorous anecdotes about Rich Voss' recent wedding at a Canadian rest area, and Jim Norton called in to share more wedding stories and discuss his upcoming HBO project.  Opie revealed he had recently been dumped.

The final segment featured a call from Billy, who had recently gone through a breakup.  He discussed his post-breakup experiences, including obsessive phone checking, and the insensitive reaction from his brother. The conversation broadened to include the differing emotional experiences of being the dumper versus the dumpee, and Billy's recently aired HBO comedy special. He discussed his initial reluctance to watch it and his satisfaction with the production quality, particularly the avoidance of excessive audience laughter shots.  The hosts and Billy analyzed common tropes in comedy show editing, and a "What Did We Learn" segment featuring listener calls followed. Future guests for the next show (Big A and Stalker Patty) were mentioned.  The overall tone was casual, humorous, and included vulgar language.

[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Shut the fuck up.  You're a fine bunch of bullies, aren't you?  I'm Opie.  I could give a fuck.  I'm Jim Norton and I'm on the radio.  Shut up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's all about fun, fun, fun.  I'd love to spit in your face.  I will fucking kill you.  Shut up, stupid.  I'm just a zilper.  I'm just a zilper and I know it.  Who cares?  We're trying to do a fucking radio show.  I know what we're trying to do.  I'm sitting here across from you.  I understand that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Despicable asshat.  And these dummies at work for us.  You guys stink.  Ben looks like a tall baby.  Always laughing in the wrong places. 
[00:04:00]  Ben, where's the quality?  He rocked.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  That is...  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And he's stinky.  You are cordially invited...  Huh?  ...to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  The show is a disaster.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  If you have any poo, sing it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  I've been here for seven years. 
[00:04:30]  Nothing works here.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  Wow.  No shit.  No shit.  Ah, very good.  I want that head so sanitary and squared away that the Virgin Mary herself would be proud  to go in there and take a dump. 
[00:05:00]  Take a dump.  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Hi there.  The O and A virus spreading across America thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  And it's Whip Em Out Wednesday.  It is.  Still waiting for the WOW hotline.  Waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting.  It was supposed to be.  Waiting.  A WOW hotline.  How is that going to work?  Seems like a very simple concept.  It's kind of like the FU line that we have.  Yeah.  That the listeners have a lot of fun with when we're not broadcasting. 
[00:05:30]  Basically, you know, WOW, Whip Em Out Wednesday.  You have a WOW in your car.  There are ladies out there that will flash you if they see these Wows on your vehicle.  Whether it's a WOW bumper sticker or a WOW homemade sign.  You can get the WOW bumper stickers by going to our website, openanthony.com.  Self-addressed stamped envelope.  And we'll send out the WOW stickers, right?  Right.  Well, we don't have time to go to the phones all day long and talk about how you're seeing titties on the highway. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, so they call in to the WOW hotline.  That's right.  And we pick and choose the best ones.  That's right.  Ah, and then play them.  And we can continue with our funny radio show.  And then when we go to break, we have these WOW sightings.  So it's a very easy concept.  But for some reason, when you work for a huge corporation, it takes months and months to actually get that concept working.  You've got to have a whole new phone line, right?  How hard is that?  Oh, my God.  Now you're talking very difficult, Opie. 
[00:06:30]  How hard is that?  You've got to choose a number.  We've got the number.  What is it?  I don't know.  Something like 866-4-WOW, I think, or something like that.  Oh, boy.  Now you're just throwing out a phone number.  Well, I'm going to throw out some phone numbers.  That's not enough numbers.  866.  Oh, is 866 like 800?  No, yeah.  So it would have to be 866.  And then, right.  Then the other three numbers.  And then 4-WOW.  How about like 1-800-866-4-WOW?  No.  Who's getting calls right now? 
[00:07:00]  Customer service.  Oh, if we don't get our WOW hotline, I'll be giving out the WOW hotline number.  Trust me.  Someone's not going to be happy in Washington.  Get it done.  Just get it done.  Man, the corporate world.  Very difficult to get things done.  Right.  We've learned that here.  Well, we've got like, I don't know, five truckers in a row calling right off the bat.  So why don't we go to the phones and say hi to Rich.  Rich, what's up?  Hey, good morning, lads. 
[00:07:30]  I just wanted to let you guys know the last segment you had yesterday was hilarious.  Oh.  We sucked right up until the end of the show, I guess.  Hold on a second.  I don't even know what we did.  You had the dating expert in.  Oh, yeah.  That's always a joy when you hear that on the radio.  And Anthony's explaining how to get the 15 or 16-year-old in the back of the truck.  Oh.  That's why the truckers are calling.  Of course. 
[00:08:00]  Laughing so hard, I thought I'd shit my pants.  I felt a little something squeak out.  We were wondering why the truckers were calling.  Now it makes perfect sense.  It was the...  I thought we let her off a little easy now.  We could have got it even worse.  I know.  She did get off a little easy.  24 and you're an expert?  How much cock have you sucked?  She knew everything.  She knew every friggin' thing at 24.  I think what a rapist is thinking when he's raping, how the fuck would you know what he's 
[00:08:30]  thinking?  They've done studies.  Shut up.  Enough with the done studies crap.  She goes out on dates and then writes about it for the magazine.  And that makes her an expert on everything sexual, relationship-oriented.  She knows everything now.  Rape, robbery.  Now the second you go into entertainment, you have no credibility.  As a therapist.  Right.  Dr. Phil, he's trying to get laid off of his fucking psychology degree.  He doesn't give a shit about you. 
[00:09:00]  He wants to get mobbed at the mall.  Yeah, if he cared, he wouldn't be on television.  Exactly.  Just the act of being on TV and having a show takes up so much of your time that you couldn't  possibly concentrate on being a shrink.  You know?  Yeah.  Like, whatever the content of said show is, you can't really pay attention to it because  the show itself is so much work.  Plus, if you look at Dr. Phil, he does not look spiritual on any... 
[00:09:30]  Like, he doesn't look like a peaceful man.  He looks like he has a brutal temper.  Looks like a fucking, like, crooked cop.  He gets mad and his whole head turns all red.  Red.  You know, he was, like, pissed because he went bald at 25 or something.  His kids are afraid of him.  Hey, I've got to interrupt you guys for a second.  Dirty Ralph has something.  Dirty Ralph.  What's up?  Hey, that number Opie gave you, it's not going to work.  It's the menopause research.  It is not.  800-8664-WOW? 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, I just called it.  So, it...  Just to see if it was taken.  Right.  It's the menopause research.  Stop it.  Try it.  Menopause research.  All right, can we try that number?  It is.  Is it really?  Yeah.  Boy, what a lucky...  I don't hear you, bro.  Yeah.  Hold on, no, I mean, the guys in the booth...  Not you.  Hold on.  Yeah, I just called it.  It is the menopause hotline.  It's a menopause hotline?  Does a girl answer?  No, it's a recorded message of a girl.  Oh, let's hear what it says.  It's not like suicide where you need it immediately. 
[00:10:30]  I think she knew it was creeping up on her.  It's not like you call up and go, what's happening to me?  It's like a menopause hotline.  Hold on, you got some time.  Yeah, you just get slightly drier over a decade.  One day you wake up and go, what the hell happened?  Buy some KY and please hold.  Someone will be with you.  All right, that number's taken.  You guys want to try another one?  How about Bill Burr gives us a number for the WOW Hotline?  Jesus.  Any number?  I don't know, 1-800.  1-800's good. 
[00:11:00]  9-4-4.  9-4-4.  1-007.  It has nothing to do with WOW.  I hate your number.  What is it?  1-800?  It doesn't mean anything.  It has to mean something.  All right, what is it?  I've never played this game before, Opie.  You didn't explain it to me?  You just said, give me your phone number.  It's exactly what I did.  I don't appreciate the criticism.  Yeah.  So is it, wait, 1-800-944?  Throw fucking WOW in there.  Okay.  What is that?  No, no, no.  What is that?  One of your friend's numbers?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[00:11:30]  We'll go with your original, but what was it again?  9-4-4?  I don't know.  1-007?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Yeah, 1-007.  It was so memorable, can't remember it.  But now it could be the number.  Yeah.  It's so obscure, it could actually work.  I was thinking of making all the numbers say something.  Like, aside from 1-800.  But what is 1-800-LOOK-WOW?  How about that?  1-800-LOOK-WOW. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  Try that one.  Try that one, too.  Maybe that's not good.  1-800-NICE-TITS.  Ooh.  Nice.  Tits.  Oh, wait.  No, that's one too many.  Well, that would not be all right, because they'll be driving.  You've got to have one hand on the wheel.  All right.  I like 1-800.  I'm going to see a lot of left breast.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Hold on.  I like 1-800-NICE-TITS.  See, now you're thinking.  Now you're thinking.  You didn't explain the concept in the war room earlier today.  Oh, Jesus.  You get the Sloan-Kettering Hospital.  Oh, nice tits. 
[00:12:30]  That's Olivia Newton-John's home number.  Tits.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  That was early for that.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  You know, because she lost the tits.  Right.  Get it?  78 degrees out.  Let's say hi to Russell.  Russell, what's up, buddy?  Hey, man.  I didn't know you guys were on a delay until you took my phone call.  You know, I mean, shit, what are you scared? 
[00:13:00]  That I'm going to say something about the Ron and Juice show.  What?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, sir.  What?  Hey, I'm Russell the Trucker.  Hey, Russell.  Right.  And, you know, I'm just calling in to complain about a few things.  All right.  We take the good.  We can take the bad.  I'm sitting down here in Birmingham, Alabama, and while that fucking hurricane was stirring 
[00:13:30]  around the, I won't use the N-word, while it was stirring around the black folks down  there, they forgot all about that girl in Aruba, you know, and they let every one of  them fucking cock lickers go, every fucking one of them.  Now, I just want to know, what do we have to say about that?  For real.  And tell me, because just because I'm a trucker doesn't mean I'm not intelligent. 
[00:14:00]  Are you, now, seriously.  No, it's your grades in high school that determined that.  Are you really serious here, sir, or is this some kind of a joke?  Because you're doing a good job of acting if it's a joke.  I'm trying to talk to you.  What is this, a Ron and Juice show?  We heard that the first time, sir, the Ron and Juice show.  So, it's Ron and Fez, and they're on after us.  Oh, I thought it was Ron and Juice.  I think we spent enough time on the Aruba girl.  That story's over. 
[00:14:30]  Well, they let those cock truckers go.  You know goddamn good and well that they, excuse my language about using the Lord's name of  Dane and things, but we are on, what do we call it, radio.  And, uh, can we just get down to business here?  Yeah, let's get down to brass tacks.  Come on, man.  Yeah, yeah, come on.  That's what I'm trying to talk about.  Yeah, talking about America.  You know damn well there's a whole bunch of Indians out there right next to the ocean.  I'm not sure exactly where that frickin' place is at, but, you know. 
[00:15:00]  Somebody took that girl and they butt-raped her, and she's out in the ocean, you know,  getting raped again by a shark.  Holy Jesus, Palomino.  This is too funny to be real.  This is a program that I can call in and really talk about exactly what I can't figure out. 
[00:15:30]  The issues of the day, yeah.  I can't figure out who Othie is and who Anthony is, but I listen to you guys every day.  And, uh, I just don't know.  Let's get down to the brass tacks.  All right, we're getting down to the brass tacks.  I think we're there.  How about you make your point, sir?  Come on, Ross.  Yeah, what's your point?  Well, well, uh, what's the world coming to?  What's the world coming to?  And I'm not talking about, uh, Billy Graham.  You know, I just really want to know what in the hell is going on here. 
[00:16:00]  What do you think the problem with America is today, sir?  Well, I think the problem with America, uh, you know what?  That's a large question right there.  It's a large question.  We'll try to simplify it for us.  Yeah.  Uh, I think everybody in America is just stone-cold fucking retarded.  Is that it?  And, uh, and, and, and there's no brass tacks there.  You don't even need to power some shit there. 
[00:16:30]  But what?  You know, these fucking mentally retarded motherfuckers need to go fucking, you know what I mean?  Shit.  Wow.  You know what?  The people that left those old folks in that nursing home to ground, they need to be commended.  Because, I'll tell you what.  Yeah.  There's too many fucking assholes in this world that need to die.  And, uh...  So let's start with the old ones.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's like that Army-Navy store guy in Falling Down. 
[00:17:00]  Remember the guy that was...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what he's like.  I'm like you, man.  I'm just like you.  He's starting to make a little sense, though.  Yeah.  Why go after the, uh, the people in the, in the nursing homes, uh, Russell?  Hey, hey, you want to know what?  Jack Kaborkian is one of my best fucking friends.  I did nursing for 15 fucking years before I became a truck driver.  This now makes even more sense.  How many smothered faces did he leave in, in the beds when he walked out of the room? 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, they just died of old age.  If I can't see you, there's more than one pillow that I'd fucking like to shove over  somebody's face.  Did you ever suffocate, uh, any of your patients?  I think he runs out of breath after every sentence.  You wanted to?  I wanted to.  Yeah.  Why didn't you?  Yeah.  But, you know, I, I'd like to stick my middle finger up some family member's ass and smother  some fucking patients.  You know what I'm saying?  We understand what you're saying.  You never, uh, turned up their medication a little too high and let them just, uh, drift 
[00:18:00]  away?  No, I was too busy taking the medication.  Just trying to deal with the cocksuckers.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, I hear ya.  What do you think we should do about the, uh, population problem?  Uh, you know, uh, there, there's certain areas that we, we, we should just think about,  uh, dropping bombs on.  I bet I know those areas.  It's starting over and that fucking New Orleans is one of them. 
[00:18:30]  And it seems like we've had a natural, it seems like God has gone ahead and took care  of that for us, you know?  But, uh, uh, you know, there, there, there's a really lot of other problems in this world  that I would like to get to.  Let's get to them.  Yeah.  Uh, but, you know, uh, you, you caught me off guard.  My brain is going blank.  I didn't bet that happened.  Because, uh, I didn't even think you'd answer my phone call.  But, uh, you know, there, there, there's other issues in this world. 
[00:19:00]  What about, uh, teen pregnancy?  Yeah.  What about teen pregnancy?  Oh, shit.  I'd like to get every one of them pregnant and fucking have them, have them go down to  the abortion clinic.  You know?  Get them pregnant and then take them down to the abortion clinic.  I gotcha.  That solves the condom problem.  Oh, my God.  Especially if they got big, nice, firm tits that are juicy and great for whip them out  Wednesday.  You know what I'm saying? 
[00:19:30]  This guy's a...  All right, Russell.  All right, Russell.  We're going to let you go for now.  All right?  Hey, I love you guys.  And tell Jimmy that I've got the juicy one that he likes right here between my legs.  And tell Jimmy I love him.  All right.  Thank you, Russell.  There he goes, Russell.  A lot of people are saying he should get a golden ticket.  I think he should get a golden ticket.  Jesus.  New bit on the show.  Five minutes with Russell.  Russell, you call him whenever you want.  I like how he kept running out of breath at the end of the sentence.  Yeah. 
[00:20:00]  I hate those things.  That's a fucking thing.  Wow, man.  Let's go to Chuck.  Chuck, what's up?  Yeah, guys.  Dang.  I want to say I love the show.  Thank you.  I apologize about that last fucking trucker.  No, I loved him, man.  Yeah, he was great.  He was good.  That's the shit we'll be talking about today after the show's over.  How about for your wow line, 866 wow show?  Wow show?  Ah, wow show.  All right.  What else you got? 
[00:20:30]  Was that what you wanted to say?  Well, man, I just wanted to say I love the show.  I've had it come for about a week.  A week?  You guys are the highlight of me having this impact.  Dude, you've missed so much.  You have no idea.  Where have you been?  We've been here almost a year.  Well, our old shows are available on audible.com.  All right.  All right, Chuck.  Thank you so much for listening.  Thanks, guys.  How many new listeners are we getting a day?  Probably 10.  You think 10?  Yeah, but every day it adds up.  12 maybe?  A dozen? 
[00:21:00]  Maybe 10 to 12 a day.  Think about it, though.  Now people are going to write on the message book, do you hear Opie say they only get 10  listeners a day?  New listeners.  New listeners.  We already have well over a million.  Yeah.  And then we're doing about 100 a week.  100 new listeners a week.  That adds up fast if you think about it.  I think it's more.  How much?  It's like saying more.  It's like 70 a week.  70 a week.  I think we get more than 10 a day.  280 a month.  Think of all the people cruising around.  And all of a sudden they just become a fan of the show. 
[00:21:30]  And they land here and have to listen.  It's something completely different than whatever else you're tuning into on XM.  I want to hear from people that turned into fans yesterday.  Yesterday?  Yesterday.  Well, that guy took a week to become a huge fan.  But going with your logic, people are being turned on every day.  Do you know that guy does not know who little Jimmy Norton is?  He's a huge fan of our show now.  Has no clue who little Jimmy Norton is.  Because Jimmy's been gone a week.  Yeah.  Yeah, I got you.  There are people that are fans of this show that have no clue. 
[00:22:00]  They think it's Opie, Anthony, and Bill.  That's it.  They're like, yeah, he's kind of funny.  He's not perverted enough.  Yeah.  He's got a transvestite every once in a while.  You should just do a transvestite thing.  What the hell?  No.  Just as a goof.  Jump in.  Just as a goof.  Just as a goof.  Tell people you like hookers to piss on you.  Shit like that.  You can't even fake that, right?  No.  That's like there's a real badly organized porn store about three blocks down from me. 
[00:22:30]  You know how usually they have, the way they set up the porn is they gradually get more and more psychotic?  Right.  This is one where, I don't know, it was like ten people just grabbed tapes and just stuck them in.  So you literally go from something like, oh, that's too lame.  That's not going to do anything to literally people shitting on people.  You're like, so it's just like, oh, yeah, it's kind of, ah!  And then you go, oh, look at that Puerto Rican.  And then there's some dude sucking a cock.  You're like, oh, my, can we have a fucking aisle? 
[00:23:00]  Because in most porn stores, they have that aisle.  Like, you just fucking turn the corner.  You're like, oh, that wall.  You're just like seeing people tied up and gagged and shit.  You're like, all right, with shit on their foreheads.  I've been there.  Yeah, German titles to the videos.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Das Bude.  Das Dumper.  Yeah.  God, you make a great point.  You have to have the slow fade.  Yeah, exactly, into oblivion.  The old mom-and-pop video stores used to have the porno section in them when you used to rent. 
[00:23:30]  And it was the beads.  You know, everyone's seen that.  And you'd have to walk in there.  And you'd usually end up going in there with your friends.  You get in an afternoon, you want to rent a porno.  And if you've ever made that error of turning the corner and ending up in front of the gay section,  your friends just don't.  What are you looking at?  Hey, faggot.  You want to rent the cocksucker video?  Go rent that one, faggot.  Yeah, I was browsing, right.  Like I knew it was coming.  It's horrific.  It is.  It just comes out of nowhere. 
[00:24:00]  Some dude with his legs behind his neck.  He's like, ah!  Big ass exposed.  Oh, what happened?  How did I get here?  I was just looking at the chicks.  You had the beads in my town.  They had, like, the wooden shutters.  The saloon doors?  Yeah, the saloon doors.  They barely even covered you.  You could see, like, from your knees down and your whole head.  There was no privacy at all.  Thanks for the privacy, Dick.  And you never wanted to make a beeline for that section, either.  Yeah.  You'd kind of, hmm, fried green tomatoes.  Start humming to yourself and whistling. 
[00:24:30]  Bridges of Madison County.  No, the negotiator, Sam Jackson.  Right.  And then you make that quick step into there.  And they hear the beads.  Everyone turns in love.  Or the door.  Fucking.  The pervert just went into that section.  I think DVDs are much more sanitary, they seem.  Yeah.  Those videotapes were nasty.  Yeah.  And they never had the tapes in the box.  So you had to bring that huge box over to the cash register with, like, hardcore porno  pictures on it.  The box is, like, three feet by five feet. 
[00:25:00]  And you bring it over to the desk.  A huge picture on it.  I'd like this one, please.  Other ones where they have, like, 18 pictures of, like, every fucking possible position.  Yeah.  The whole movie is frame by frame on the box.  Oh, good choice.  You're going to rent ass rammers.  Yeah.  I like that one.  I go to a porn store about once every, like, six months.  And I always go by and I always look at that Max Hardcore section.  Because he was a guy, like, he was one of those guys, he went over the edge for me about 
[00:25:30]  18 tapes ago.  Yeah.  So I like just picking up the box and seeing, like, what extra level of fucked upness he's  added.  And, you know, he already had, like, those things where he would stick things into, like, their  pussy that, like, held him open.  Oh, right.  I didn't know what it was.  It was, like...  Some gynecological tool.  So now the last one I saw, he's literally busting a nut in this girl's face.  And he smears the lipstick all over.  They look, like, not even human.  And then he's got this thing where he holds their head and he takes his thumb and lifts, like,  one of their eyelids up, like, a little bit higher. 
[00:26:00]  So they almost look like a fucking zombie.  Oh, Jesus.  It's horrific.  That is horrible.  Beyond the point of help.  Yeah.  And do you watch these?  Or you just...  No.  Last one I got of his was...  Actually, no.  I'll rent the ones that before he went off into the abyss.  At least my line was just like, I can't follow you in there.  I don't like the violent stuff, though.  Like, I don't like slap happy.  It's funny, like, for a few seconds.  And then it just gets like, oh. 
[00:26:30]  They're smacking the girl in the face and gagging her with the cock.  And her eyes are, like, two beats because so much jizz is in her eyes that they're stinging.  It's all red.  You got a red eye.  Red eye.  Yeah, I don't know.  Call me a romantic.  That stuff doesn't quite do it.  All right.  All right.  How do we get here?  You never know.  Thanks, Russell.  You never know how we get there. 
[00:27:00]  Actually, you know what?  I wanted to do this a couple days ago.  Bill Burr in studio.  Filling in for Jim Norton and doing a great, great job.  Jimmy called me while I was having steak with Super Agent Bob Eatman last night.  You did lunch and dinner with Bob?  Bless you.  It's two free meals.  St. Opie.  Two free meals.  Yeah.  I went to Bobby Vann's, a great steak place, with Robert Eatman's brother there.  What could you possibly discuss that we didn't discuss during lunch? 
[00:27:30]  Well, no.  See, the lunch was the business meeting.  Yeah.  The business lunch.  And then dinner is just the social time.  Yeah, but it's with Bob.  Catch up on our personal lives.  But the steak was good.  Yeah.  So Jimmy called, and I'm like, Jimmy, I can't talk to you.  I'm at dinner with Robert Eatman, you know, Super Agent Bob Eatman, and his brother, Russ.  And Jimmy goes, what's the name of the place?  I can't even say the word.  Mausoleum? 
[00:28:00]  Mausoleum.  So I start laughing really loud, and I just turn to Bob, and I go, Jimmy says hi from L.A.  Jimmy's been in that situation.  These guys are a bore.  Yeah, you just sit there at dinner, and, you know, it's your agent.  You've got to hang out with him every so often just to catch up on business.  But, um...  And he was the agent of that girl here yesterday?  What's going on?  No, no, no.  No, he was the agent.  Is he really representing Laszlo now?  I think so, yeah.  Is he?  Yeah. 
[00:28:30]  He represents everybody in radio.  Yeah.  He's like the radio guy.  He represents us, Ronna Fez, Laszlo.  Yeah.  Scott Pharrell, I think.  Oh, all right, because I was literally sitting there.  What kind of...  If he knew you guys, why would he put her in here?  No, no.  He had nothing to do with that.  No, he doesn't.  That mess.  Yeah, we don't do it.  Do that type of thing.  Dude, is it really hot in here or what?  No.  Seriously?  Yeah, I'm fine.  Really?  Fine and dandy.  God, I am sweating like a pig today.  Are you percolating?  No, I'm fine today. 
[00:29:00]  You're trying to get those sweats.  No, I already had the...  Those are the worst.  When your legs go out on you.  You ever get just the pain in the back of your thighs so bad your stomach hurts?  Ow.  In between your nipples and your kneecaps, it hurt.  I am sweating like a pig.  Yeah.  You hot in here?  A little.  You are, right?  Oh, Dan, stop kissing ass.  You are not.  Yes, boss.  I swear to God, he never kisses ass.  Nathaniel's not like that.  Are you hot or not? 
[00:29:30]  No.  I'm a little warm.  It's a little warm in here.  Oh, come on.  No.  Oh.  All right, what I wanted to do was play the Bill Burr OzFest PSAs.  Yes.  This stuff was really, really funny.  Bill Burr went to OzFest with, you know, Martini Steve, Hybrid Steve, Steve the Bear.  What else is he called these days?  Dan's fanning himself.  He just started fanning himself like he's hot. 
[00:30:00]  You're not hot.  It's definitely hot in here.  It's fine over here.  There's no passion.  No.  Yes, I am.  He wasn't selling it.  Oh.  It's hot.  We can like.  It's on the air conditioning.  Come on.  Danny, we can clear all the phone lines, too.  I hope he says it's hot.  All right.  Here's Bill Burr doing some stuff for us at OzFest.  No.  He went down there with Steve.  Come on.  Don't play that. 
[00:30:30]  Come on, the air conditioner.  Oh.  Bill had access to a lot of no-name bands, basically.  Oh, come on.  No-name bands.  That's the extent of my Ray Romano impression.  I just go, oh, come on.  You're afraid to jump further because then you might lose it.  Yeah.  You got it down with two words.  That's so true.  Oh, come on.  I think you try to talk and it winds up sounding like Kermit.  Yeah, so just keep it there and you're perfect. 
[00:31:00]  So Bill decided to have some fun with these kind of no-name bands.  And he talked to a band called A Dozen Furies and made them do like a fake PSA for the Opie  and Anthony program.  Imagine being A Dozen Furies and listening to the show.  You're all excited.  Oh, they're finally doing the interviews.  They've been talking about it for a week.  And Opie gets on and goes, yeah, some no-name bands.  They just sit there and go, we have a lot of guys that work for us in the demo. 
[00:31:30]  In the demo that A Dozen Furies is trying to hit, right?  Yep.  Does anybody know A Dozen Furies, the band A Dozen Furies?  Yes, gentlemen.  Everyone's shaking their head now.  Big fans.  No?  No one?  No one knows.  No.  I'm not saying they aren't a no-name band.  I'm just saying they probably don't consider themselves a no-name band.  If they've played OzFest, they're probably like, we're rocking, we're rolling. 
[00:32:00]  All right.  Oh, whoa.  Oh, hey.  Hey, Travis.  No.  Who played that music?  Oh, wow.  He got you.  Wow.  E-Rock just fucked up Derek's whole day with that one.  He walked in the studio and then walked right out.  Derek loves that bit, too.  He came up with it.  Yep.  He came up with the, uh, Eric having walk-on music.  There he is.  There you go.  It's such a glutton for punishment. 
[00:32:30]  And now Eric leaves.  Eric has walk-on music.  Now, Travis, wow.  This is a big chance you're taking here.  You're telling me.  You know of, uh, that band.  Yeah, I'm pretty sure they were the band.  The band that I forgot the name of already.  A Dozen Furies.  A Dozen Furies.  I'm pretty sure they were the band that won the Battle for OzFest show on MTV.  Oh, really?  I, uh...  And what does that mean?  I did not know that.  There were a bunch of other no-name bands and they were the best no-name band.  Exactly.  Oh. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Hey.  He's getting really good at that.  Hey, Steve.  Comes right in.  I was...  I didn't realize Travis was in here, but, uh, uh, the, uh...  Go ahead.  Say what we just heard.  Motherfucker.  I'm actually alert.  This guy has the definition of Mike Fright.  Yeah.  He just freezes up.  Yeah.  I don't know what it is.  I get in here and all eyeballs point on me and I tense up like that.  I don't know what it is.  He closes his eyes and tries to gather his thoughts.  I do.  A Dozen Furies was the band that won Battle for OzFest.  So they got the, uh... 
[00:33:30]  Exactly.  Thank you.  And they're on Sanctuary.  Isn't that what Travis just said?  Yeah, it is.  But I walked in here just as he was saying it.  What?  No shit.  All right.  So it's a popular band.  Uh, yeah.  In that, uh, in that, uh, OzFest click.  Yeah.  And the no-name band community.  And there you go.  You can get out of here fast enough.  Fleeing.  So Bill Burr talked to A Dozen Furies and had him do a fake PSA for the Opie and Anthony program.  All right.  What's up?  It's, uh, Bill Burr. 
[00:34:00]  I'm standing here with, uh, the guys from, uh, Dozen Furies.  Hey, we're doing a skin cancer awareness thing here on, uh, Opie and Anthony.  So if you guys could just say something to make, you know, the kids aware about skin cancer.  Just wing it.  Anything.  Throw a couple of fucks in there so the kids will listen to it, you know?  All right.  Dude, we are out in the sun all day long, every day.  And we put on sunblock probably, like, five times throughout the day, man.  You know, you got to take care of yourself.  You got to take care of your skin.  Start over again.  Just throw a couple of fucks in there.  Seriously.  Yeah, yeah.  They're crazy over there.  Man, we're...  Start over again.  All right.  Just say, you know, skin cancer awareness. 
[00:34:30]  All right, man.  We're fucking cock facts.  And, uh, we put on a lot of sunblock.  Fuck.  Ah, yeah.  We're out in the fucking sun all day long, man.  It's just fucking beats down on you.  And, you know, dude, you got to fucking take care of it, dude.  You got to wear sunblock.  You got to wear it over and over again.  Especially if you want to keep the tattoos fresh, dude.  That's a lot of you need to tighten it up.  That's...  Just tighten it up real quick.  Just real quick.  Wear your fucking sunblock.  Sunblock, bitches.  All right, guys.  I love that.  Sunblock, bitches. 
[00:35:00]  You're going to have to do this again for us, man.  It's too good.  It's just too good.  Trying to be all hip and cool about it.  The next no-name band that Bill Burr talked to was Shadows Fall.  Oh, Shadows Fall.  Anyone?  Shadows Fall?  Yeah.  I just picked up their, um, new, uh...  EP.  I didn't.  Nothing?  I picked up nothing from them.  I have no idea who they are.  No one's coming forward.  No one around here knows Shadows Fall.  Their website looks just like the last band's website. 
[00:35:30]  My fan just popped it up.  I'm like, what?  Same website.  All right, well, Bill Burr made these guys do a fake PSA as well.  Yo, what's up?  It's Bill Burr.  Open Anthony's show.  I'm talking to Brian Fair from Shadows Fall.  Great set, man.  How do you feel about it?  Oh, it's been awesome, man.  The whole Oz Fest is just incredible, man.  You know, sharing a stage with Maiden and Sabbath doesn't get any better than that.  Yeah, see this.  How the hell do you sing like that for so long?  I mean, I yelled at my dad like that for about 20 minutes one time.  I couldn't talk.  Yeah, I'm used to it for yelling at my girlfriend that much.  You know, it builds it up.  You've got to build the strength, you know?  Well, you know what? 
[00:36:00]  We're going to do that drop right now.  You know what's good?  I'm glad you brought that up.  We had Open Anthony's doing a thing for domestic violence awareness.  Yeah, somebody kicked the shit out of their girlfriend in Newark or something.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, so just ad-lib some sort of drop and not do domestic violence to your girlfriend or whatever.  And, you know, it's kind of weird.  We toss a couple of F-bombs in there just because our listeners are retarded.  But just try to keep the good message.  So just say there's Brian Shadows Fall and stuff and stuff?  Yeah, yeah, just don't beat up your girlfriend.  Just, you know, fucking don't beat up your girlfriend or something like that. 
[00:36:30]  What's up?  This is Brian from Shadows Fall.  Man, you've got to stop punching your girlfriend out there.  Save that shit for the bedroom.  You know, that's where it's at.  But, you know, don't take it to the streets.  Okay, do it again.  Just throw, like, one fuck in there.  That's the way to go.  They're idiots.  What's up?  This is Brian from Shadows Fall.  Just saying stop hitting your fucking girlfriend, you idiots.  All right, save the violence for the bedroom.  All right, cool.  All right, man.  He saved the violence for the bedroom angle that he took on that.  He liked it so much the first time he had to incorporate it into his second attempt.  Yeah, I didn't even get that. 
[00:37:00]  Because Bill wasn't happy with his first one.  I love that.  They do it.  It's probably all uncomfortable.  And then he makes them do it again.  Tighten it up.  Tighten it up.  Tighten it up.  That stunk.  Talking about domestic violence here, sir.  And finally, Bill talked to another band at Ozzfest named In Flames.  Oh.  And had them do a PSA as well.  Listen to this.  Hey, what's up?  It's Bill Burr.  Open Anthony Show.  You know that because you're listening to this shit.  I'm with the bass player from In Flames, Peter Ivers. 
[00:37:30]  So how do you think your set's going to go tonight?  Are you looking forward to it?  Are you on the main stage?  Yeah.  Are you over there?  I think it's going to go great.  I mean, we always put in 150%.  And, you know, it's a bit different playing from a sitting down crowd.  But still, it's going to be great.  So far, all the shows have been amazing.  So I'm pretty sure today will be as well.  Listen, man.  We're also doing, this is kind of a side thing.  We're kind of doing this benefit.  Somebody beat up a special needs kid in, like, Newark.  And so we just want you to just say, you know, just give a shout out to the kids so they know 
[00:38:00]  not to beat up somebody with, like, you know, special needs, you know.  So just, you know, just say, like, you know, hey, guys, you know, it's not cool to beat  up somebody just because they're different or whatever, you know.  Just, you know, just like a quick kind of, like, like a sound bite.  And it's kind of weird, but throw a couple of, you know, fucks in there just because our  fans are kind of retarded, you know what I mean?  So you need to, like, just make them, like, rock and roll, you know.  Yeah, sure.  So just wing it.  Hey, guys, this is Peter from Inflames.  You should treat everybody equally and don't beat anybody up or do something bad to them 
[00:38:30]  just because they're different.  Everybody's the same way.  Okay, that's totally the perfect vibe.  Just throw in special needs and throw in, like, one or two fucks.  Yeah, the upwards.  Yeah, it's kind of, like I said, they're retarded.  Same thing again, all right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, this is Peter from Inflames.  Treat everybody the same way.  Even people who have special needs and everything like that.  Don't fucking go and do any bullshit and start beating people up because they're different.  Treat everybody the same, dude.  That's beautiful.  And the kid's name is Russell. 
[00:39:00]  Just give him a shout-out.  Same thing.  Couple of fucks.  He's a big metal fan, so it'd mean a lot to him.  That's the kid who got beat up, Russell, from Newark.  Hey, Russell, what the fuck are you doing?  Sorry you can't be here today.  Just take care of yourself, man.  See you soon.  All right, dude, that's beautiful, man.  Thanks so much and good luck tonight.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  I love this bit.  You just throw a mic in front of someone and they do it every year.  You tell them to, no matter how ridiculous.  No, I just kept looking back at Steve.  Like, did we get the audio?  Like, meanwhile, there's some fucking band playing in the background.  Run!  You get that?  We get it? 
[00:39:30]  I love these special needs.  And then, yeah, our listeners are fucking retarded.  Yeah, they tell you to.  Use the derogatory term for special needs children.  Wow.  No one picked up on that.  No one turned to you and just said, you're a fucking idiot.  I am not doing this.  You cannot be serious.  I felt bad for that last guy because he was, you know, he's European, so he's speaking a second language.  I mean, they could get me to say anything in Belgium.  He tops you right there.  Yeah.  Very, very funny. 
[00:40:00]  All right, we're going to take our first break.  What's with Imus today?  Imus looks like someone mixed up color forms.  He got, like, the cowboy set with the businessman set.  He's wearing a suit jacket, like a blazer, and a pink shirt with his old brown cowboy hat.  It doesn't...  That look was in, like, 1982.  Is that it?  When, like, that movie Urban Cowboy came out.  Yeah, Urban Cowboy.  Yeah.  Yeah, look, it's a suit jacket and a red and white...  A Johnny Rockets shirt.  Johnny Rockets shirt. 
[00:40:30]  And then the old...  It's not even, like, his dress cowboy hat.  Like, there should be...  He should have the bolo tie, like they wear in Texas, with a big piece of turquoise and  the silver.  And then the nice, maybe...  Nice felt hat.  He's got his working man's hat on.  Looks like one of those things where it's a face, and you spin a wheel, and the hats change,  and the coats change, like a little kid's toy, and he mixed it up and put the businessman  attire with the cowboy attire. 
[00:41:00]  It just looks...  It looks stupid.  Meow.  Chill, chill.  Oh, okay, just one...  That's all I got.  I got one thing.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  That's why I got to write jokes.  My act will be over in three minutes.  Just...  You got, like, impressions?  Just for a mile.  No, come on.  What's this guy's...  Don Imus.  Don Imus.  Meow.  All right, we're going to keep this show going.  You're ready for your next act. 
[00:41:30]  Coming to the stage.  Russell.  Hey, man.  Uh-oh.  You're so fucking a whole lot of cocks.  All right.  Let me tell you something.  All right.  You know, the first thing you need to do is get rid of that goddamn, uh, what do you call  it, uh, two minutes delay?  You know, because, uh, I can't even talk and listen on the radio at the same time.  My dog wants to fucking bite your ass.  And, uh, let me tell you something. 
[00:42:00]  You know, in order to do a good radio show, you need to wake up in the morning and at least  read the motherfucking newspaper.  Is this ELO?  You folks have no idea, uh, uh, what you're doing.  You know, and I love you guys, man.  I listen to you every morning.  We have no idea what you're doing.  I sit down the fucking left side of my fucking window, man.  All right, Russell, Russell.  How about you do the news for us today? 
[00:42:30]  Oh, shit.  Bring it on.  Well, what's, uh, what's in the news today?  Uh-oh, uh, uh, uh, I'll give, I'll give you some thought starters.  How about hurry?  Wait a minute.  I'll tell you what's on the news today.  Oh, you don't need a thought starter.  All right, let's go.  I don't need to read the fucking newspaper.  You know what?  There's a whole lot of people out there.  It takes them, uh, a whole lot of time to read the newspaper.  And I'll just goddamn tell you one thing.  That, uh, you know, there's a problem. 
[00:43:00]  There's a problem out there in this United States of America.  That's stalling.  And, uh, they got blown away.  I'm sorry there's so many black people out there.  You know, but that's not a white problem.  You know, but let me tell you something.  Oh, wow.  Well, they moved over into Houston and shit like that.  And now the tornado is coming right.  The tornado.  Yeah.  Well, I'm having a bad problem and thinking that maybe they might need to, uh, move over 
[00:43:30]  to the Arizona dome, you know.  The Arizona dome?  Oh, yeah.  Because, uh, you know, for some reason the good Lord has sent these hurricanes around here  and it's not so good for them.  Yeah, around here.  Yeah.  No, no, no, no, no.  What we've got here is failure to communicate.  Hey, Russell, are you trying to say that the hurricane is now going after the people that left Louisiana, New Orleans? 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, and it doesn't matter if they're black or white.  You know, but let me tell you something.  Why is God mad at those people and sending hurricanes after them?  Well, uh, geez, I don't know.  He's just a guy that really doesn't like queers or black.  So God doesn't like queers or black, so he's sending tornadoes.  Just a down-to-earth kind of guy.  Hurricanes.  I know, I know, I know Opie, Opie just really despises the good Lord, but you know what? 
[00:44:30]  He's got a plan.  Wow.  All right, Russell, all right, Russell.  We're going to let you go.  What?  You don't let me know, Arnold?  What?  I don't fucking see my hurricane after your ass, too.  I'll bug it out.  All right, there he goes, Russell the trucker.  Wow.  His laugh sounded like Norton imitating Ben.  All right, we'll talk about Hurricane Rita when we get back, I guess, and other things. 
[00:45:00]  And we've got to get into this Harry and Nathaniel challenge.  Yeah, I was hearing a little of this on Ron and Fez yesterday.  So you're going to have to fill me in.  I have no idea what's going on.  Yeah.  All I know is there's a lot of excitement around the XM Studios here today.  Harry and Nathaniel are going to have, what, a laugh-off or something?  All right, we'll get into the details next.  It's crazy.  Short movie.  This is what it's all about. 
[00:45:30]  We can now understand.  Oh, I love this.  Short movie.  Wow.  T-Shot 36 Double D.  T-Shot 36 Double D.  Shoving her breasts in everyone's face.  36 Double D.  T-Shot 36 Double D.  Oh, wow.  She just will purse out.  She'll flash it.  She'll flash it. 
[00:46:00]  Hey, I'm all for it.  She'll flash it.  And there's boobs in your face.  I'm all for it.  With the Mount Wednesday.  The night's at.  Rest.  Hey.  This is what it's all about.  With the Mount Wednesday.  Oh, I love this.  Sure.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, wow. 
[00:46:30]  Whip them fuckers out.  This is fantastic.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  That's why we call it.  Wow.  Talk about the movies.  We're going now.  We're going now.  Take your ball and get it now. 
[00:47:00]  We're going now.  We're going now.  We're looking now.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  We'll be right back. 
[00:47:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:48:00]  Cat 4, as they say now, used to be category, but now we've had so many hurricanes this season in the news all the time that now they're just calling it Cat 4. 
[00:48:30]  Cat 4.  Category 4.  Very dangerous storm.  It's in the Gulf now.  That's a hip weather, man.  Yeah.  Cat 4.  We're talking Cat 4 here.  I guess that God thing's not working out for President Bush, huh?  Talks to him on a daily basis.  He loves the God thing.  He talks about God all the time in his speeches and when he's setting policies and all that.  Christian.  How does that work that the people that were in New Orleans, they get hit by the hurricane.  They're displaced.  A lot of them go to Texas, Houston, Galveston, wherever they are over there on the Texas coast of the Gulf. 
[00:49:00]  They go there.  They've been praying.  They have been asking God for help.  Not only does God not help them, but he sends another hurricane right at them.  He sends another motherfucker right at them.  Another huge...  Let's just call it another motherfucker.  Motherfucker right at them.  Right at where they went. 
[00:49:30]  What the fuck is that?  Yeah, you keep going to your churches.  Have fun.  I'm bailing at this point.  I don't believe shit.  It's not even like he didn't help, but at least he's keeping the status quo.  We can, you know...  You've got to pray to Satan now, like sacrifice a lamb or something.  You do.  Pentagrams all over the place.  Because for some reason it's not working.  He is not only not helping, now he's kind of having fun with you guys.  He sent another motherfucker.  He's kind of goofing on you now.  You're praying. 
[00:50:00]  You're asking for help.  He just...  What does he do?  Does he spin his hand?  What's the act that he does to make one of those hurricanes?  Like he's bowling.  He puts a little English on it, and there it goes across the Gulf.  Yeah, everybody took off.  It's like the 7-10 split right now.  Yeah, now it's a 7-10 split.  What do I hit?  I hit New Orleans again.  Do I hit where they went?  No, you hit Houston, and you knock it into...  If they went up to Little Rock.  Oh, right.  Yeah, you kind of curve it around the coast a little English.  You're just going to clip Houston in the Astrodome and send it shooting up. 
[00:50:30]  Like a pro, when you think it's going to go in the gutter, and it just stops, and then hooks and goes strike.  Right.  He's fucking around.  He's got a blindfold on.  Hey, what?  With a trick shot.  I'm just going to toss this.  Watch this.  Watch this.  I think it just shows he has a sense of humor.  I mean, you've got to start laughing at this graph.  This is a huge storm.  Another one.  A cat four, as Ann said.  A cat four.  I think he's repeating himself.  Yeah.  He did it last year in Florida.  Yeah.  And now he's doing...  It's a copycat.  This is like, yeah, the sophomore jinx.  More of the same. 
[00:51:00]  So are all the two stars.  You're reviewing his hurricane and just thinking it's a pale comparison to the first one.  Are all these people now bailing out of Houston?  They have ordered some voluntary evacuations.  I hear, though, by maybe later today or tomorrow, there will start being mandatory evacuations.  A lot of people are very critical of the five-day hurricane track.  I heard this on the news yesterday.  People are saying it panics a lot of people.  They really aren't sure within five days where exactly this thing's going to turn up. 
[00:51:30]  And it kind of gets people that...  It gives them that cry wolf syndrome where they look at the five-day.  It says it's coming toward you.  And then it really doesn't.  And they go, oh, look at the news again, scaring everybody.  But it only moves just a little bit.  It all depends on what happens.  We knew it was going to hit New Orleans like five days out.  No, they didn't.  They really didn't.  And they said it might and it probably will.  But if something happens in the Gulf, if another storm pops up somewhere or a low-pressure or a high-pressure forms somewhere, 
[00:52:00]  that's what steers those things.  That bumps them around and it could turn them one way or the other.  That's why they can't definitely...  If they definitely knew, they would evacuate, like, immediately.  This is definitely coming here.  Get the fuck out.  Well, they're reeling us all in again, man, because I'm watching Fox and MSNBC.  I'm just waiting.  I'm just waiting.  You're showing it in, like, real time.  Yeah.  Well, I'm frustrated because the thing moves, what, 15 miles an hour or something like that? 
[00:52:30]  Like 12 miles an hour or something like that, yeah.  If you had a bike, you could stay ahead of it.  You could definitely outrun it.  You'd have a tailwind just pushing you along.  You could outrun it.  Well, we got some audio coming in.  Let's listen to what the Today Show has on Rita.  As the president again checked on recovery efforts in New Orleans and South Mississippi,  oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico were being evacuated.  In the port of New Orleans, Marines were recalled to the Iwo Jima supporting the Katrina recovery effort. 
[00:53:00]  It will ship out for now.  And the infamous convention center was being cleaned should it be needed as a medical shelter.  We are completely aware of the potential dangers that we would face if the storm ventures toward the eastern side of Texas.  New Orleans can't take much bad weather.  In addition to a damaged infrastructure, New Orleans levees, though patched up, are severely weakened.  Right now, weakest link is still the place where we did the patches.  We estimate right now that that could withstand maybe five-foot surges. 
[00:53:30]  Officials have put a steel barrier over the entrance of a canal whose levees broke, flooding the city of New Orleans.  But, Matt, there's nothing anyone can do about the rain, even if they get only a portion of Rita.  Even a little bit of rain here could have a devastating effect to an area which has already been hit hard.  If you did a cannonball into the Gulf of Mexico, you could flood that whole fucking city.  One of those guys falls off of the oil rig.  It's going to send this little riffle to people. 
[00:54:00]  No!  The levees!  They pretty much just got the whole place pumped out, too.  A lot faster than they originally thought, by the way.  Oh, they were talking six months underwater.  Took two and a half weeks.  Two and a half weeks.  Two weeks.  They're pumping it out.  It's all pumped out.  And this thing could just flood it again.  And Bush is just, he's looking frazzled.  What'd I do?  He just keeps going down there and taking a look.  You think he's doing that?  Yeah, just kind of looking around like, where do I start? 
[00:54:30]  It's a lot of brush.  Yeah.  Sticks in the road here.  But we're going to rebuild.  He does nothing.  He was down there yesterday.  All over the news.  I watched again.  He gives a speech, a rah-rah speech, about how they're going to rebuild and send money down there.  It's something he could have done from Washington.  But he flies down there.  We're going to send funds down to the people who need to be funded. 
[00:55:00]  It's like one word.  He just latches onto it and says it 52 times.  I love how he just stammers.  I thought I had a stammering problem.  We need to send money to the people that need these finances to be financially viable again.  Speaking of Big A, is he going on that date tomorrow with Stalker Patty?  Tomorrow, Stalker Patty and Big A, Paisanos and Mulberries. 
[00:55:30]  Street.  I'll have the lasagna.  How uncomfortable is that waiter going to be?  Oh, he's got to stand there.  Oh, you've got to make him up.  Well, we're doing a whole thing.  Nathaniel's going down there and getting audio and video.  But I think they're coming in studio tomorrow morning, right?  Yeah.  We should do some kind of thing.  What thing?  You know how they do that dating game thing on TV, something. 
[00:56:00]  Like which one are we going to rip off?  Love Connection?  Dating Game?  I don't know.  Maybe these guys can come up with some questions for both of them so we can get to know them a little bit.  Maybe we throw Patty in a soundproof booth and then we talk to Big A and then we talk to Patty and see what kind of, you know.  Like the newlywed game.  Is that the one we want to rip off?  Newlywed game, you've got to know something about each other.  Yeah.  Dating Game.  Tattletale.  Is finding out about each other.  Tattletale.  With the big headphones.  That's knowing about each other.  Remember the Burt Convy? 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  And they would have, yeah.  Treasure Hunt.  All right.  So it has to be the Chuck Woolery game.  Chuck Woolery.  Chuck Woolery, the Love Connection.  Love Connection.  Let's do some kind of Love Connection tomorrow.  What they do in Love Connection, I believe the format was they sit down with Chuck and discuss what they like.  And then they go out on the date and discuss how the date went.  Bitches love Chuck.  Yeah.  Chuck Woolery.  Yeah.  We'll be back in two and two flashing his Rolex.  All right.  Could you guys get something out of it tomorrow?  Rolex presidential.  He was pimping. 
[00:57:00]  He was the shit.  All right.  So tomorrow they'll have to, what questions though?  Ah, these guys are good.  We'll figure some stuff out.  The man said immediately.  We might actually have to do some work after the show today.  We might actually have to stay 15 minutes.  Yikes.  That ain't happening.  Are you all right with that?  No.  Carmelo, what's up?  How you doing?  It's Bill Burr.  Uh, Bill Burr is in studio.  Yes.  Yes.  Okay.  Yeah.  I just wanted to congratulate him.  That stuff was hilarious last night.  I caught the replay on the HBO last night. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, awesome.  And I was getting ready to punch out on it, man.  But, uh, when he started hitting that religion and, and, uh, the black people with the clothes  and, and all that jazz, man, I, I, I just lost him.  My wife's calling me up.  Come on to bed.  Come on to bed.  I said, fuck you.  I gotta watch the rest of this shit.  That's some funny shit, man.  That's a review.  You wanna go to brunch?  I said, fuck you.  Did you just go all the way to bed?  All right, Carmelo.  Just a second.  You know, that phrase is still available at that point, isn't it?  Honey, you coming to bed? 
[00:58:00]  Fuck you.  I'm out to Harlem, too, man.  I was fucking out of it, man.  All right.  Thanks, Carmelo.  All right.  You guys have a good day, man.  Good show.  All right.  Right on.  Let's say hi to Peter in New Jersey.  Peter.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Happy birthday, Billy.  Thank you.  Thank you.  That's funny.  Just go over there.  Jesus.  Go ahead, Peter.  I was gonna say, do you guys have the clip of the end scene of The Devil's Advocate where  Pacino's just going off on God? 
[00:58:30]  It's just like that, man, where he's saying, God's up there, and I ain't putting his ass off.  That is a good scene.  Do we have that?  Pacino doing his best Pacino impression.  It's searching right now, so I can't do anything.  Searching.  If we have it, we'll play it.  If not, we'll get it for tomorrow.  Sir, would you like some more coffee?  Fuck you.  Hey, Russell.  You fucking manly retarded motherfuckers.  Russell.  Hey.  Hey.  Oh, no.  Why?  You know, you guys got me on that goddamn delay.  I don't want to, you know, mention his name, but it starts with Howard, and it doesn't 
[00:59:00]  end with Hughes, but fuck the money that he's making.  Somebody ought to shoot that fucker, stab him in the ass with a needle, and break it  off.  You know what I'm saying?  See, I think Russell has a problem because he thinks we're on this big, long delay.  We're not really on a long delay.  Russell.  Russell.  Russell.  You talk a lot of good shit, but you fucking end up with Jimmy Norton.  What the fuck does that even mean?  You have to slow the feed down. 
[00:59:30]  Russell, we did some news.  We did some news for you.  What did you think of our Rita coverage?  We had some intelligent stuff there.  You know what, you want to know what?  I think Rita, I think, you know, I look like a big, fat, fucking truck driver.  One with a big, fat Peterbilt with lots of chicken legs and everything, and I'm right  behind it, and I'm going to show up Texas as that.  You know, Texas has got a lot of problems.  You know, I don't think that New Orleans has a thing to worry about.  Russell.  I think that folks should come down in there and move back in. 
[01:00:00]  Russell, where do you call home?  Uh, I call home right, right next door to the package store, or some people call it  the liquor store, and it's right here in the back of my truck, with my little fucking  chihuahua dog.  His name is Scooter.  Scooter.  Scooter.  Scooter.  Hey, Russell, no, where, where, where, what state are you from?  Uh, well, I, I originated from California. 
[01:00:30]  That's where I became mentally retarded.  And, uh, I, I know Scott Peterson, lived in his neighborhood.  I moved out, and I now live in Knoxville, Tennessee.  Knoxville, Tennessee, huh?  Yeah, that's right.  And there's a lot of good-looking women over there.  Before Whip Them Out Wednesday even came out, they were already showing me their tits.  You know?  And it's a good deal over there.  Uh, the property's cheap, and I, I, I, I'm very happy about living there. 
[01:01:00]  All right.  Well, thank you, Russell.  Hey, I love you, too.  I didn't say I love, all right.  All right, there he goes, Russell.  He's one of those I love you, fuck you guys.  I thought he said he was from Birmingham, the first call, didn't he?  Did he?  I didn't hear where he said he was from.  Did he say that?  Maybe he did, I don't know.  All right, we got the clip from Devil's Advocate.  I guess it's the one you were talking about.  The hell we find, uh-oh.  Oh, no.  Wow.  It should be, though.  Is it the one about God?  Yeah.  Yeah, I got it.  All right, here we go.  Let's hear. 
[01:01:30]  Let me give you a little inside information about God.  Oh, God.  God likes to watch.  He's a prankster.  Think about it.  He gives man instincts.  He gives you this extraordinary gift, and then what does he do?  I swear, for his own amusement, his own private cosmic gag reel, he sets the rules in opposition.  It's the goof of all time.  Look, but don't touch. 
[01:02:00]  Touch, but don't taste.  Taste.  Don't swallow.  And while you're jumping from one foot to the next, what does he do it?  He's laughing his sick fucking ass off.  He's a tight ass.  He's a sadist.  He's an absentee landlord.  Worship that never.  Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven.  Is that it?  Why not?  I'm here on the ground with my nose in it since the whole thing began. 
[01:02:30]  I've nurtured every sensation man has been inspired to have.  I cared about what he wanted, and I never judged him.  Why?  Because I never rejected him.  In spite of all his imperfections, I'm a fan of man.  I'm a humanist.  Maybe the last humanist.  Stop whining.  What happened to Pacino?  What was that?  I'm a fan of man.  Fan of man. 
[01:03:00]  What did he say?  What's he saying there?  I have no idea.  I'm a fan of man.  I'm a fan of man.  There we go.  That was, all right.  That was Pacino like over the top.  He's almost reaching that Christopher Walken phase of his career,  where he is kind of a parody of himself.  Every movie, he's got to do this and get loud.  You like yell and.  And you know the director wants to be like,  dude, could you take it down a little bit?  Yeah.  It's like, it's Al Pacino. 
[01:03:30]  He knows what he's doing.  I know what I'm doing.  Yeah, he's got to yell.  And the contrast.  In heat, all of a sudden, he's interrogating that guy,  and all of a sudden, he just starts hitting the table going,  come on, give me something.  His fucking eyes are bugging out.  And you see the other actor sitting across,  and I'm like, dude, what the fuck?  I can't go with this.  Even I know this is bad.  What happened to him?  You watch The Godfather.  He's not doing that.  He's become the guy, like, when you take an acting class.  There's always that one dude, like, when he goes up to do a scene, 
[01:04:00]  you, like, go to the bathroom because it's just so fucking horrific.  You can't watch him?  Oh, just awful.  Just like, oh, my God.  What happened?  To be or not to be.  Here's the question.  I'm a fan of man.  What?  And then the contrast between him and fucking, uh,  yes, well, I think that God is...  Keanu Reeves.  What, Keanu?  Oh, yeah.  Great.  He just literally says in his head,  after he says the thing about the tree,  then I say my thing. 
[01:04:30]  He's not even, like, fucking lit.  He's not even, like, what do they call it?  Nothing.  Throwing the ball?  No.  Nothing.  There's no interaction between the two.  They could be on different coasts doing it via satellite.  There's just no chemistry there whatsoever.  He plays the same character in every movie.  Yeah.  He's one of those guys.  Nicolas Cage is the same way, man.  Every movie, the same freaking voice.  Pacino in The Godfather, there was some kind of dynamic there.  where he was Michael Corleone at the beginning, 
[01:05:00]  a little, you know, kind of not part of the whole family.  He was soft-spoken.  Him and Kei sitting at the wedding.  And then he gets, you know, evil.  But there's no over-the-top.  The only time he really got angry, I think,  is when Kei told him about the abortion.  Oh, yeah.  And then he freaks out.  And that's it.  It's like a subtle simmering.  Yeah, yeah.  The whole movie is a build-up, you know,  and his personality is very dynamic. 
[01:05:30]  He goes from those lows to the highs.  But now it's just, it's an on-off switch with him.  Sometimes he's like this, and then it goes here!  And there's no in-between.  His voice sounds like a blown-out speaker.  Like one of those big ones you used to get at Radio Shack.  The bass just can't even...  Big, tinny mess.  Or the one you used to have on the back.  Remember they used to put the speakers by your back window on the platform  and a few too many times at the beach and sand would get on them? 
[01:06:00]  And it would bounce around as people were talking and the music was playing?  Tom Cruise is another one.  He's Tom Cruise in every movie.  Yeah, there's nothing else there.  Was it The Last Samurai?  Yeah.  Yeah, look at the guy from Cocktail.  Yeah, it's Cocktail.  Yes, with a sword.  He's one of those guys.  Cavalry.  You know what, I like those really bad actors  where it's like they've got to play a different character  so they grow a mustache.  Right.  But they still talk the same way.  Same character with a goatee.  I changed the part of my hair. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  I've done work on the character.  He grew his hair, cut his hair,  but cannot change his character.  Speaking of Tom Cruise,  Steven Spielberg says he'll never talk to him again.  And they were friends.  A little angry.  A little angry.  Because, you know,  he was supposed to promote that,  what, War of the Worlds?  And he got all crazy on TV  talking about everything else  but War of the Worlds.  Scientology, his chick.  His chick, Ritalin.  Yeah.  What did Tom say about Spielberg?  The glib.  And Spielberg is like,  Spielberg is like,  I'll never talk to him again 
[01:07:00]  and we're not friends anymore  and I'll never work with him again.  That's right.  Spielberg's not that big in the business.  He's really pissed off.  You want to throw that friendship away, Spielberg?  Do you just kill yourself  if you're friends with Spielberg  and you're in the business  and Spielberg isn't your friend anymore?  That's not that big a bridge to burn.  Nah.  I don't think so.  Who's Spielberg?  What has he done?  Oh, man.  You want to get into this  Ron and Fez, Harry versus Nathaniel thing?  Yeah.  What is this about? 
[01:07:30]  You were listening on the way home yesterday?  I was listening and I heard Harry,  who's just,  he must be in his glory  because he is becoming quite the personality  on the Ron and Fez show.  He was a little peripheral character  we used to goof on on our show.  We couldn't be bothered.  And now he's a big part of the Ron and Fez show.  We couldn't be bothered with Harry  when he was doing our show.  I just, I didn't see it.  Maybe we missed the boat with him.  Maybe.  Maybe.  No, everyone's shaking their head no.  He's becoming a big star on the Ron and Fez show.  The star.  And we were just like,  Harry, just get us coffee. 
[01:08:00]  Please.  And now he's a big part of Ron and Fez,  the Ron and Fez show.  And I guess he does comedy.  Is that what I hear?  He was doing some one-man show  at the,  at some theater,  a theater.  Oh, I saw that.  You did see that?  Yeah, I was on,  I went on the,  the stand-up show afterwards.  Oh, you did?  Where?  Yes.  Wait, you actually saw Harry?  I'm just admitting to these awful gigs. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, he was performing at Starbucks.  Oh, yeah, I went on after.  Oh, shit, did I just let that out?  Yeah, I was at the UCB theater.  Right.  Yeah.  Right.  Was he good?  Yeah, it was funny.  Harry was funny?  It was cool.  Like, show, like, clips and stuff.  It's a whole.  I mean, it wasn't like,  it wasn't like O&A funny.  It wasn't O&A funny.  It wasn't like transvestites  and shit like that.  Well, what I hear is a presentation.  He had, like, slides.  Yeah.  Did he have slides?  And he would comment on things like Dick Cheney 
[01:09:00]  and anything else?  Bush?  Is it political?  It's like a one-man show.  Anyone?  Bueller?  A little healthier?  He was trashing the media.  What, is he here?  That there was no news.  Oh, well, bring him in.  There's Harry.  Look at this.  It's like a crossover.  This is great.  Isn't it?  When the Flintstones went on the, you know,  they did the Jetsons.  So bring up the biggest hack reference  to a crossover that everyone brings up. 
[01:09:30]  Flintstones, Jetsons, yeah.  That was good.  But, no, I was doing a,  it was a political one-man.  Political one-man show.  And it wasn't like,  it wasn't slides like a presentation.  It was like bits type of thing, you know.  Did you have a slide projector?  This is not a man I saw on stage.  The other night.  You guys had some sort of fucking  hold over this guy.  That wasn't him.  Posture.  The whole way you're holding yourself, man.  It's just different.  Yeah, it's very,  I get very uncomfortable  when I come into this studio.  Yeah, you're making me look like an asshole  because I just talked about how great you were.  I actually have clips in the delight of it. 
[01:10:00]  If you guys want to.  Now, wait a minute.  I'm confused with the slides  or the projector or something.  Well, no, it wasn't all like bits and things.  It was part like stand-up  and part like I would talk about, you know,  Bush being Time Magazine's person  person of the year.  Did you have a projector?  Yeah.  Okay.  You just said you didn't.  Well, it's not a slide projector.  It's like a PowerPoint.  Who cares?  Okay.  Who cares what the, yeah.  Who cares about the technical aspects  of your projector?  Something was projected 
[01:10:30]  and you commented on it.  Yeah, and they were like,  I had like short films  and things like that as well.  I'm like interrogating them.  This is like a liberal  going on Fox News right now.  Yeah.  Fucking it's over.  So there were,  it's over.  It's not even about the show.  Of course not.  Did you have a marker?  Well, I mean,  it sounds like a pen.  Did you or did you not?  I just wanted to undermine  his credibility a bit here at first.  There were some kind of pictures  and then you commented on them.  Yeah.  But that isn't his whole show.  All right.  That's just part of it.  All right.  It's a small portion  of his one-man show.  All right.  So we got Harry in studio,  Nathaniel in studio. 
[01:11:00]  We got some audio from Ron and Fez  because it all started  on the Ron and Fez show.  All right.  You want to go with clip one?  Oh, you have it over here?  Okay.  There was like a behind-the-scenes  hint dropped  of our comedian producer,  Harry,  going head-to-head  against their comedian producer,  Nathaniel.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  Could you beat Than?  In a joke-off  or whatever you call it.  I mean, at a club,  I think I could do well. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  All right.  So that's how it started yesterday  on the Ron and Fez show.  Yeah.  Now,  this would be,  how do you compete  in a comedy competition?  I don't know.  It seems a little...  The only one I've been in,  which I won.  All right.  Yeah.  There we go.  Going down.  Fucking smack.  Was done by Oplazometer.  Ah, the old Oplazometer.  Fairly imprecise,  except in this particular instance. 
[01:12:00]  What was it?  Just a guy  putting his hand over your head?  Pretty much, yeah.  And seeing how many people clap.  But now,  that could be  skewed one way or another  depending on  if the audience  has a lot of O&A fans.  Absolutely.  And there are a lot of  fan fans,  family members.  I don't know.  Seems like it could be loaded  a little bit.  Sure.  The other way  would be to have  professionals  that are very,  you know,  astute  in the business  watch 
[01:12:30]  and then judge.  Sort of like  a Last Comic Standing.  Right,  like a panel  of professionals.  I think that's  the way to go.  That could look  at the act  and pick it apart.  All right,  well we have  make someone leave  feeling very badly  about themselves.  We have more audio  from the Ron and Fez show.  Let's go to track two here.  All right,  so when is this  coming down, Fez?  I have no idea.  It was just mentioned  in the hallway,  but it sounds like  something that we  could get rolling on.  Yeah,  I accept the challenge  on behalf of Harry.  Harry,  can you shut this guy down? 
[01:13:00]  What exactly  is the competition?  It would be like  Last Comic Standing.  You both go to a crowd?  Yeah,  I think I can do it.  we put you in a house,  you're going to be  living together.  Oh,  wait a minute,  I got an email.  Voss is in.  I don't even know  how that happened,  but Voss already heard,  he heard Last Comic Standing  and he said,  count me in.  And Harry is Ralphie May.  Yeah.  All right,  so that's from  Ron and Fez yesterday.  Yeah.  Let's go to track three.  So Harry,  you're going to shut  Nathaniel down.  You'll finally  shut his pie hole. 
[01:13:30]  Well,  I mean,  I like the guy,  but if he wants  a comedic challenge,  I don't.  Yeah,  if he's feeling froggy,  jump.  Let's do it.  Now,  what are some  of the stipulations  you want?  I mean,  I don't know,  Nathaniel,  I don't think  is going to have  like slides and stuff  like you had last night.  No,  whatever.  Should it be straight comedy?  No,  any way.  Any way he wants  to bring it.  I mean,  I'd like to do it  in some kind of  comedy club setting  in front of an audience.  You know what I mean?  And that we'd both go on,  you know?  Why don't we bring  listeners in here?  We set this up.  I guess we could  go about doing that. 
[01:14:00]  I mean,  I wouldn't mind that.  Nathaniel's trying  to get a hold  of Nathaniel on the line.  Here's the way  I want to do it  and see if Nathaniel's  brave enough.  Loser leaves town.  Do it the old-fashioned way.  Loser leaves XM.  No,  I don't want to see  either of us leaving.  It won't be you  if you're the funniest.  I know,  but you never know  when something can go wrong.  I like Loser leaves town.  Fucking Ronnie.  I just got here.  I'd like to stick around.  Yeah?  Just for a couple of days.  Yeah.  There's a Days Inn  out in Jersey  right on the other side  of Lincoln Tunnel.  Yeah, 
[01:14:30]  right?  You got to stay there.  You got to leave town.  Literally.  Yeah,  you just got to stay there  for three days.  Just for three days  and a Days Inn  across the river.  That's really funny.  Get out of town  by sunset.  All right,  let's go to...  You got to walk  through the Lincoln Tunnel  on that little fucking thing.  A little walkway  on the side.  Let's go to track five.  Yeah,  we'll go to five  because that's long.  You know what?  You know what?  Enough.  I can beat him. 
[01:15:00]  All right.  Harry throwing down  the gauntlet,  as they say.  I am so distracted  by...  What is that?  Amos has a live band  on today.  All right.  And I don't know  what it is.  There's some drummer  that is a thousand years old.  Yes,  yes,  oh,  big deal.  Yes,  and share my hands  and I'll be...  Who is this?  Oh,  that's...  Oh my God, 
[01:15:30]  the great Levon Helm.  Oh,  it is Levon Helm.  Okay.  Marmonica,  Larry Campbell,  that was great,  you guys.  Deuce from Southland,  Samoa,  Levon Helm,  17 after the hour.  17 after the hour.  Meh.  Levon Helm.  Whoa.  Yeah.  Maybe we could get  stuff like that  going on.  What?  No,  come on.  What are you doing?  It would be great  to have things like that  going on  on our show.  Hey, 
[01:16:00]  now you got the music.  Oh,  come on.  No.  I'm only going to have  three,  that's all I can do.  That's all you can do,  but the music's playing now  so it really sounds good.  You gotta add one more  for variety.  One more?  Yeah,  one more word.  Maybe one,  maybe...  You're setting me up to bomb.  I've been this distance  long enough.  Come on,  say banana  the way he does.  I'll be like,  no,  come on.  Banana.  I can't do it.  Fuck that.  I told you I suck at this.  All right,  so Harry is claiming  he could beat Nathaniel  in a laugh-off. 
[01:16:30]  All right,  now Harry discusses  Nathaniel's weakness.  Oh.  This was on  yesterday's Ron and Fez show.  That would be track six.  Hey,  John,  you're on Ron and Fez.  Hey,  if you're wanting  to end up  on this comedy joke-off,  don't make it  a leave-the-town match.  What you gotta do  is you gotta set it up  for keep the cop  to come in  and pay the loser  live on the air.  You know what?  I have no problem  at all  of Fez  and Harry  being tased.  They will not  bother them 
[01:17:00]  even slightly.  Why get a taser involved?  Isn't the hair enough?  You feel like  you can represent?  Yeah,  I'm gonna bring it.  People don't understand,  you know,  because I...  What is the weakness  for Nathaniel?  Nathaniel's weakness?  I think,  I don't know how much  he deals with crowd work  at all.  And you do?  Well,  not...  Because I hear you in here  working the callers,  working me in Fez,  and I'm like,  that kid is quick.  I think Nathaniel's thing  is that he hasn't been  doing it as long  as I have.  Wow.  How long have you been  doing it?  I've been doing it  for four years now.  Four years, yeah.  How long has the end? 
[01:17:30]  Do you know?  I think less than a year  or a year at this point.  And he's very funny.  He's really a funny guy.  Nothing to take it away  from him,  but if that's what  this is about,  I gotta represent  and I'm gonna win.  Wow,  so he's talking smack  about your experience.  Now,  unfortunately,  I have not seen your act,  Harry.  I've not seen it.  I've seen Than,  and I was stunned  that he had been doing this  for such a short period of time.  He's very natural on stage.  We like him.  His delivery is great.  You would think  he'd been doing it for years.  A lot of confidence 
[01:18:00]  in his eyes.  Yep.  Confidence,  funny material.  I would say that face  is something to prove.  Do you have a clip  of your stuff?  Yeah,  I have some stuff  in the let.  I would like to hear  a little of that.  That's a lot of stuff.  And I've seen Than  work the crowd  and work hecklers  and stuff  and do a great job.  You know what?  We know what Nathaniel's  all about,  so Harry,  which bit do you want us  to play?  Because I don't want  to just like...  Pick a good one.  Pick a good one.  Pick your best bit.  Go on.  Get a good one.  Get a good one.  By the way,  this is the worst challenge ever. 
[01:18:30]  Why?  Why?  Because they're not  talking smack yet.  Yeah,  there's a little smack talk.  You gotta be in studio.  There's a lot of staring.  Harry's complimenting Nathaniel  too much.  I'm gonna kick his ass  and he blows.  There we go.  Wow.  Alright,  there you go.  Alright,  what bit are we gonna hear here?  Can you riff on his  wrinkled green shirt?  It's about weapons  of mass destruction.  Yeah,  the reason I wore this  is because it's cold.  I'm not wearing this  for fashion.  Gap for kids?  Really?  Yeah.  I hope you were spending  the time you should have  been ironing working 
[01:19:00]  on your act.  Maybe that's why.  Wait,  so you're wearing  a short-sleeved shirt  over a short-sleeved shirt  because you're cold.  Because that's 10%  of arm you're covering.  It's supposed to be longer  than the shirt  that you have underneath it  that looks a little ridiculous.  And you're cold,  you usually wear a vest.  He really is gonna get out of town.  He's like an Old West bartender.  He needs those things  around his arms.  A couple of shots of whiskey.  Alright,  so this is a bit  on the weapons  of mass destruction.  Alright.  Alright.  Weapons of mass destruction 
[01:19:30]  was the biggest phrase.  Weapons of mass destruction.  We have to go in Iraq  because they have  weapons of mass destruction.  I don't know if you watched  the coverage of the war  like I did,  but the Iraqis  barely had weapons  of regular destruction.  Not exactly the best  adjective to use.  They painted this picture  as if he had the weapons,  but he just refused  to use them.  Like,  I saw them,  they have been bombing us  for 30 days now.  Do you think  maybe we should use  one of the weapons?  Not yet.  I want to see  where they're going  with this. 
[01:20:00]  That's funny.  It's not bad.  That's good stuff.  I will be honest  in saying that  the guy who comes in  here at the radio station  is not the guy  who does the stand-up,  and I don't know  why I can't make  the transition.  Oh, boy.  It's not the guy?  No, I'm saying...  You're not that guy?  No, I'm that guy  on stage.  You know what you're  going to have to do?  Are you going to do that  like when you go in  for acting auditions?  When they go,  hey, you know,  you think you really  got something there, kid?  Come in and read  for this part.  Okay, before I read  for this part,  I just want you to know.  The guy who's going  to read for this 
[01:20:30]  is not that guy  you saw on stage.  No, what I'm saying  is I'm not hearing  any confidence.  I mean, obviously  your stuff's pretty good,  but you have no confidence.  No, I have no confidence  in my ability  on the radio.  But if we do this  laugh-off,  we're going to do it  live on one of the shows,  probably on Ron and Fez.  Yeah.  So you're going to have  to do it for  a national audience.  They are actually  doing you a favor  with this awful vibe  that they can...  Unsupportive thing.  Yeah, you've got to be  able to plow through that.  Tough love.  Nathaniel, comment?  Uh, no.  Sorry. 
[01:21:00]  I mean, I think  that I'll do fine.  I don't know.  Is all your stuff  politically based?  It's not all politically.  No?  Do we have another example  of something  that isn't political?  No.  The only thing I loaded up  was the political stuff  from the Monday night show.  What else do you touch on?  I mean, I touch on  everything from, you know...  Relationships.  Personal life.  Yeah, relationships.  Yeah, personal life.  Parents, things like that.  Yeah, family.  Family.  Well, let's play another track.  Which one do you want?  Um, go to the one on, uh...  Hold on, let me see.  Just pick one at random now  because that was like  a good one 
[01:21:30]  and he knew it was good.  So now just pick one.  See what, uh, comes up.  Uh, Bush skin color.  All right.  Here's Bush talking about, uh,  freedom and democracy  in Iraq during the 2004 election.  You know, there's a lot of people  in the world  who don't believe  that, uh, uh...  that people whose skin color  may not be the same as ours  should be free.  Self-done.  I reject that.  I reject that strong.  People think that, Mr. President? 
[01:22:00]  Nobody thinks that.  You just made that up.  And it's fucking brilliant.  You can do that with anything.  Uh, there's, uh,  there's people out there  who, uh,  who think it's okay  to call Canadians  and snow faggots  and...  I'm against that.  There's, uh,  there's people out there  who think it's right  to cut off baby heads  and skull fuck them. 
[01:22:30]  And that's wrong.  I think you went too far there  on that one.  With the skull fuck...  Snow faggots, yeah.  Snow faggots  and ripping the baby's head off.  It was a good house.  What was that psycho yelling  during your set?  I, oh, Eastside Dave  from the, uh,  Ron and Fez show.  Actually, a friend.  Oh, really?  Who got a little, yeah,  Eastside tends to get  a little bit wasted.  Oh, that's the worst  when a friend of yours...  Loaded house, huh?  Oh, loaded house.  Well, I asked some friends  to come on.  It wasn't a bringer show. 
[01:23:00]  How nerve-wracking is it  when you, like,  go to click on a clip?  Like, that the crowd  is just going to turn on you.  That's the worst part  is when you do that  you fuck up one clip  and then they all...  Because it's on a  PowerPoint presentation.  And then for the rest  of the show, you're fucked.  So if you...  Five minutes in,  then all your clips  are out of sync.  Yeah, see...  I don't think that's what...  Eh, well...  It's not really stand-up  is what you say.  No, no.  So it's going to be weird.  This is going to...  No, it's like the first  Ultimate Fighting  when you actually saw  different styles.  One guy was a boxer. 
[01:23:30]  One guy did you...  Before, they all knew  how to grapple.  Yeah.  This is what this is.  What is better?  This is like stand-up?  This is like Muhammad Ali.  Or whatever that is.  Or a slide show.  What would you call it?  The presentation?  Interactive?  What is it called?  Daily show?  I just called it  a one-man show.  That's a little pompous.  One-man show.  You cannot just call  a one-man show  because it's you  and a PowerPoint presentation.  One-man show is something  that I think  an established orator  or a comic does.  Spaulding Gray. 
[01:24:00]  Spaulding Gray.  There you go.  Spaulding Gray.  Why don't you take his example  and jump off a fucking boat?  Yeah, Spaulding Gray.  Someone that has established something.  I think it's very  presumptuous  that no one knows you  and you're having  a one-man show.  Like, one-man show is  whoa, I know that name.  I gotta see this guy.  Well, there's plenty  of famous people  who do  non-famous people  who do one-man shows. 
[01:24:30]  You don't have to be famous  to do a one-man show.  You just don't know about them?  Yeah.  I like how people  direct the one-man show  and there's always  that moment  where they make a comment  and then the whole room  goes dark  and then they show a clip  and then the dude  who's doing the one-man show  takes like five steps  over to the left  and then a spotlight  comes on over the thing  and he's like,  my dad in 1974.  It's just like,  oh, shut up!  Who can do that  with a flashlight,  you fucking moron?  I directed that.  I directed his one.  I told him to walk  five feet over there.  The drama there. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  I brought the dimmer down  and then turned on  the other spot.  It ends what you were  talking about  and starts anew.  It's like a different color.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  A different mood.  Oof.  Let's say hi to Ellis.  Ellis in Philly.  Ellis!  You are a one  fucking  John Stewart hack.  You fucking rip-off.  So anyone who  does anything about politics  is just fucking  John Stewart.  Well, there's a little  John Stewart to the delivery.  There is a little bit.  What's that?  No, Nathaniel had that  great line when they're  saying what his show 
[01:25:30]  was like and he said  The Daily Show  and everybody else  missed it.  Oh, okay.  Because we weren't  listening?  Maybe.  So have you been  influenced by The Daily Show  where John Stewart  at the beginning  there's a lot of clips  and he comes back  and comments on  what was said.  Yeah, I enjoy The Daily Show.  It's just a different way  of doing a comedic thing.  It's not the only thing  I do.  I've done stand-up  for the most part.  This is the only  one-man show I've done.  Plus, you're only four years in.  I couldn't defend anything  I did six years into stand-up.  Plus, playing the clips  is great because you don't 
[01:26:00]  have to write set-ups.  So...  Oh, nice.  All right, Nathaniel.  Wow.  He's being lazy.  I don't understand.  I think there's sarcasm there.  That's what I love  about Nathaniel.  I love his sarcastic ways.  It's doing stuff  that I can't do  at the club  because when you do  that type of material  at the club  the audience sometimes  doesn't give a shit  about that.  They'd rather hear about  hey, remember Tetris?  That's what they like  at that fucking club.  Ooh, that was a little  swipe at stand-up.  Yeah.  I love stand-up.  I'm just saying  sometimes you can't do  that type of stuff.  None of you guys  down at UCB 
[01:26:30]  like stand-up.  You guys are always  trashing us.  Yeah.  Saying that we're  talking about airplane food  and that you guys  are like these  brilliant fucking...  I'm turning on you  right now.  Nice.  I see that, Phil.  That's good.  You're the one guy  who supported me, too.  I have no one left now.  I'm still with you.  But I just know  that any time they do  an interview  with an alternative comic  they can't just fucking  stand on their own merit.  They always have to  trash stand-ups.  They're like,  this isn't like  some guy working on  his five minutes  for Letterman  with his airplane 
[01:27:00]  food joke.  It's like, yeah,  that's how you get  on Letterman.  Thanks.  You can get on  Letterman with  airplane food jokes.  Yeah.  Maybe back in 85.  All right, we got  Alabama Trucker  on the line.  Alabama Trucker,  what's up?  Hello?  Yeah, go ahead.  Yeah, I just wanted  to throw something  out there.  I might be wrong,  but Harry,  you fucking suck.  You burko-wearing  communist motherfucking  faggot.  You're a fucking  piece of shit. 
[01:27:30]  You suck.  Every time I hear you,  I want to drive my truck  off the fucking road.  Punching out, guys.  Thanks.  In my defense,  I'm not a communist.  Well, you made fun  of Bush, so obviously  you have to be a communist.  See, that's how it goes.  You can't make fun  of Bush.  Then you're against  the troops in America.  Exactly.  No matter how many times  that guy just sounds  like an absolute  fucking moron  in front of a microphone  if you make fun of him.  Right.  You communist fucking  faggot.  Yeah, that's right.  John from Freeport  asked Harry about  the David Cross line 
[01:28:00]  that he ripped off.  I didn't rip off  a line.  Was someone accusing  you of that?  I said that the  magnetic decals  that you put on your  car might be  a pointless gesture,  but it wasn't really  like a bit.  I didn't do  like a bit on it.  It's something that  he said about  American flags  during the 9-11 thing.  So the magnetic  like the ribbons  and stuff you're  talking about,  that's what you do?  And then you say  a pointless gesture.  Where does that go  from there?  It's not a bit.  It's just like  a quick reference I did.  Both hack topics  by the way.  Yeah.  Because I had bits  on both of those. 
[01:28:30]  I had bits  about the American flag  and that's hacky shit.  Yeah.  No one can claim that.  David.  I talk about  Haagen-Dazs  and how it makes you fat.  I came up with that.  All right.  Well, like Hurricane Rita,  this is slowly  but surely developing.  Yep.  I'm pretty confident  about a win  no matter what  the format is.  This Harry Nathaniel  laugh-off  is slowly,  slowly spinning  out of control.  There's just a lot  of stuff going on  it seems. 
[01:29:00]  You're dependent  on technology.  It's like a shuttle launch.  It could end  in disaster  and loss of life.  Some tiles come off.  During his hack  he loses some  heat tiles.  Can't bring them  in to the end  of the show.  I have done  one one-man show.  It was Monday.  Before that  I've never done one.  I don't have  another one scheduled.  You just did stand-up.  Yeah.  So it has to be  a stand-off.  Well, yeah.  A stand-up stand-off  or whatever.  Yeah, I wasn't  going to bring slides  with me.  All right.  Color charts  and some graphs. 
[01:29:30]  And what happens  when you have to go  to Kinko's  before your act  it could be a problem.  It's just, you know,  it helps.  There were a lot  of like Letterman  type bits  that I had.  Letterman type bits?  Well, yeah.  Things that aren't  necessarily stand-up.  Letterman SQ.  What?  Things that aren't  necessarily like stand-up.  Yeah.  Like with the  Photoshop stuff.  Oh, you do  Photoshop stuff?  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  You do them yourself?  No, I don't.  You have a guy  that does the  Photoshop  and then you bring  them on stage 
[01:30:00]  and they get laughs.  Yeah, it did  all right Monday.  I mean, it did  pretty well.  Is this the guy  who directed the show?  Is this the guy  who directed the show  also doing the Photoshop?  Or do you have  a whole staff  helping you?  I just have friends.  Isn't that...  That's a little odd.  Like someone else's shit  is going up there.  Well, it's my idea  and I come up  with the concept.  I just don't have  the skill to Photoshop it.  What is an example  of one of your Photoshop?  One of the bits  I had was  I was talking about  how Mission Accomplished  he had that banner.  Right, we all saw that.  That's just a catchphrase. 
[01:30:30]  It's just like  a bumper sticker.  So that wasn't  the first slogan  they were going with.  Ah, so you Photoshopped  a bunch of different slogans.  What were a couple of them?  Yeah, honk if you're Arab.  There was Jesus saves  white people.  And the one I thought  was the catchiest  was ask grass or cash.  No one starts  a faulty invasion for free.  And it worked.  It killed.  I mean, it doesn't  always work well  as far as stand-up goes.  It wouldn't be a bit  that I did stand-up.  Yeah, it's kind of a visual.  Yeah.  Glad I made you  go through that  visual bit. 
[01:31:00]  Me too.  Eroding credibility.  Well, we'll see  where this goes.  All right?  I'm sure Ron and Fez  will have more on this.  It's Harry versus Nathaniel.  It'll laugh off.  Yeah, we'll keep tabs  on this developing situation.  This is so exciting.  Yeah, keep your excitement  in check, Daryl.  Jesus.  All right.  I like it.  Yeah, why not?  All right, we'll continue  in just a bit.  I can't find a bra  that will holster  my massive hooter. 
[01:31:30]  I'm very proud  of my big toe.  Thanks God  for Whip'em Out Wednesday.  Whip'em Out Wednesday.  All right, we're continuing here. 
[01:32:00]  I got some granola.  I gotta get down.  Yum, yum, yum.  Oh, you're eating.  Gots to eat.  Granola.  It's a great sounding thing  for something to eat.  Very tasty.  What does that do for you?  Bind you up?  Yeah, kind of.  It's like eating cement.  Gravel.  A little gravel action.  What is that laced with?  Put anything in there? 
[01:32:30]  Just like a couple, like, raisins.  You eat things that aren't supposed  to be eaten outside of your home.  Like, this is the environment  for sandwiches and, like, yogurt.  Things like that.  Things that you gotta pour in a bowl  and put milk on,  and now you need a spoon,  and you need the bowl.  The problem is,  when you do morning radio,  there's not much to eat  in the morning.  It's like one of those  awful Grape Nuts commercials  where the guy's in the bathrobe 
[01:33:00]  out in the woods.  Yeah, with the bowl in his hand.  Sitting on a tree stump.  That's what he eats.  It's like, no one's out there  eating like that.  Yeah.  Outside with a bowl and a spoon,  and it's just too much work,  is what I'm saying.  I understand,  but if I don't eat,  I pass out.  I'm like a step away  from pizza ovens in here.  And he does the blueberry thing.  Flip the dough around.  Anthony.  And he can't hold the blueberries  in either hand for two.  I don't know if it turns him blue.  He just sits there  and I'm playing three-card Monty  with his blueberries.  Yeah, you're adding fruit into it.  I'm trying to find stuff  I could eat in the morning. 
[01:33:30]  You eat like a half a bagel  and salsa water,  you're good for the day.  What about like  just egg sandwich?  I haven't seen Bill  eat anything yet.  Egg white sandwich or something?  Something that's compact,  easily portable?  That's a problem.  It's like,  you could eat an egg white sandwich  or granola.  There's nothing to eat  in the morning.  What else do people eat?  Yogurt?  What?  In the morning?  Bacon, egg, and cheese on a roll.  Yeah, they get that stuff.  Yeah, that was the old construction thing.  I know it seems like a good idea.  Yeah, it seems like a good idea.  It just sits there  like a big glove 
[01:34:00]  of wet cement.  Every morning  when I was doing construction,  they would go to the deli  and grab, you know,  give me two eggs over easy  with sausage, bacon,  ham, cheese,  and on a roll  and you'd get it,  you'd bite into it  and the yolk would shoot out the back  and it's on your fingers.  You're trying to eat  as you're driving the company van.  There's yolk on the steering wheel.  It's just a goddamn mess.  The worst is when  you get in line at McDonald's  and the guy in front of you  is a construction guy 
[01:34:30]  and he's got like 400 orders  written on like a shingle.  He's like,  yo, give me 20 sausages  and egg biscuits,  42 orange juices,  and he's fucking huge  so you can't say anything.  You're going to be like,  dude, what the fuck?  Yeah.  It used to happen  at the deli all the time.  It's worse at a deli  because it's like one guy  behind the counter.  All right.  He's there cutting the ham  for the sandwiches  and cooking the eggs  and he's got 20 more to do  and you're sitting there  and just want like a sandwich 
[01:35:00]  and a pack of cigarettes.  It's worse getting behind  the scratch-off people.  Oh, what now?  Yeah.  Well, we're talking about,  you know,  getting behind people in line  when they step up to the counter  to get all their scratch-offs  and all you have is like  the newspapers  and, you know,  a bottle of water  and there's no...  Hey, dude,  if you want to go first,  go ahead, courtesy there.  They will sit there  and, all right,  give me one of the...  Give me the...  Give me two.  Give me two.  Yeah, set for life.  Instant winners.  You need more than just that money 
[01:35:30]  to be set for life,  you freak.  Yeah, instant winners.  Put the...  I need the numbers here.  Give me three, five, nine, boxed.  Give me one broke in eight months  no matter how much I win  because I don't understand money.  Give me a family  will hound me forever.  That would be a great reality show.  Watch these people blow all their money.  Give me seven flat-screen TVs  and no property. 
[01:36:00]  Let me get 80 grand  of depreciating assets.  No, yeah.  Give me 200 grand of liabilities,  no assets.  Julie.  Yeah.  Help me out.  Okay.  Anthony.  Yes, Julie.  Stop with the freaking granola.  It's wonderful  and people do eat that in the woods.  I'm out in the middle of Montana, 
[01:36:30]  out in Grizzly Country,  backpacking,  and that is exactly what people eat.  We ate couscous and grilled vegetables  because animals don't smell that  as something different  from the environment.  You god damn hippie.  I'm probably,  I'm,  I'm,  I'm totally not a hippie.  I'm totally a corporate person.  You totally are.  I have a corporate job,  but you know what?  Why are you a vegan man?  And Opie,  let me tell you,  a really good breakfast.  Yeah?  Steel cut oatmeal.  Don't cook it.  I've started that, 
[01:37:00]  but it takes a half hour.  No,  don't cook it.  Don't cook it.  And then put  skim milk,  coconut,  peanuts,  walnuts,  frozen blueberries.  Fish oil.  Frozen blueberries.  I was with you,  but this steel cut oatmeal,  I started cooking that crap up.  You can't eat that without coconut.  Yeah, you can.  It's like eating little pebbles.  Don't cook it.  All the nutrients will come out of,  are you a vegetarian?  Not at all.  No?  You eat meat?  Absolutely. 
[01:37:30]  Okay.  I had you pegged as one of those.  One of them vegans.  I'm totally not one of those type of people.  But when you are traveling,  when you're backpacking  and doing that type of thing,  you need things that are light.  Oatmeal is one of them.  Light.  You don't carry sugar.  You carry,  you know,  you carry,  How far are you backpacking  that you got to,  like,  figure in the weight of the food  that you're carrying?  How long do you go for?  Couple days.  Couple of days.  How much food are you going to carry 
[01:38:00]  where it's like,  well,  that puts us over the top for weight?  I never understood  the whole walking in the woods thing.  Like,  where are you walking to?  Is there,  what's the goal?  Well,  you know,  my goal was just,  I wanted to see wildlife in Montana,  so I got to see grizzlies  running in the wild.  I mean,  how many people can actually say  if they saw grizzly bears?  We do every day.  Comes in with lousy clips.  That's why I would never do that shit.  You,  like,  instantly realize,  you know,  why we live inside.  When you go on,  everything's faster,  everything can fly, 
[01:38:30]  fucking run.  If a squirrel wanted to attack you,  it would win.  It could kick your ass.  It could.  You couldn't stop it.  You'd be freaking out,  screaming like a girl.  And you're sitting there  with your backpack  and a walking stick  just in case something  jumps out at you.  You think you're so tough  until you walk in the woods  and realize,  yeah.  You ever see that lady?  She's riding the mountain bike  and this mountain lion  jumped on her  and literally  was only on her for half a second,  ripped half her face off.  face right off.  Well,  you always fight  mountain lions back.  You can win 
[01:39:00]  on the mountain lions.  Yeah,  sure you can.  How?  Well,  first of all,  you carry knives.  Oh,  there you go.  All right,  Tarzan.  And you carry pepper spray.  Pepper spray.  And it's not a little bottle.  It's not a little canister.  It's a huge bottle  that clips onto your pack.  Yeah.  Would you have it in your hand  as you're walking  through the woods?  Yeah,  because those things  don't announce their arrival,  especially when you're riding a bike,  a mountain bike,  and a mountain lion  eats your face.  He didn't announce  that he's coming out.  Well,  no,  mountain lions,  you have to be most concerned  about mountain lions 
[01:39:30]  because they're very,  very stealth-like animals.  You know,  they hunt you.  Whereas the bears,  if you walk into their paths...  See,  that's why I can't go  walking in the woods  and hiking and stuff,  knowing that these things  might be just looking at you  and deciding  if they're going to  pounce on you or not.  I was lost in the woods once.  You don't have much  of a problem.  Black bear  comes right down  one of the trails,  and I just stopped  dead in my tracks  and looked at it,  and if it decided  it was going to turn around  and do anything,  it didn't do anything.  It just continued on its way. 
[01:40:00]  But if it decided  it wanted to do anything,  what was I going to do?  Did we ever tell this story?  Yeah,  I told it on the air  a while ago.  You sure?  Yeah.  Because I thought  this happened after we...  Told it when we got back.  Oh, we did.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, I got...  I was at State New York  when hiking  and went down  the different side  of the mountain  and got lost  in the woods overnight  in October.  By yourself?  In October.  Me and my chick.  All right, Julie.  Thank you.  And we had to find  a lean-to  that was like...  We found these signs,  these signs that said 
[01:40:30]  lean-to this way.  What does that mean?  It meant that there was  this lean-to,  a piece of wood  on the ground  and some wood  on the ground  so you're not  laying on the ground.  It was pouring rain,  it was freezing cold  and we had nothing.  Were you crying?  We were.  I was so close  to just losing my mind  and busting into tears  and just losing...  They went for like  a two-hour hike.  Two-hour hike.  Did you send this story  into Reader's Digest?  And then...  And we just kept walking 
[01:41:00]  and walking  and walking  and it got to the point  where we had to go down  these cliffs  where once we went down them  I knew there was no turning back  and going back up.  You just had to keep going  and there was just nothingness  and we had no food,  no water.  It was raining  so we stood under this big tree  that was dripping water  with our mouths open  just to get water  and finally the next...  So it started getting dark  and I'm like  we can't walk out of here  in the dark.  There's no way  it's going to happen. 
[01:41:30]  We will fall  and break something  because there are cliffs  and stuff.  So we saw the sign  for this lean-to.  We got there.  It was already dark  by the time we got there.  I had one jacket  which we both had to like  sleep under.  Didn't sleep much.  Woke up the next morning.  We had been walking so long  that my ankles  I could barely move them.  It was so...  So now I'm walking  like a cripple  for the rest of the way  to try to get out  in another eight hours  walking out of the woods.  Finally popped out  onto a road  and found some kind 
[01:42:00]  of a ranger station  and got driven back.  Yeah.  It was just the worst  and I will never  ever go hiking again.  And you saw a bear.  Yeah.  A bear walking  across the path  and I'm like  oh great  I'm going to be eaten  by a bear.  This is fantastic.  I don't fuck with nature  on any level.  I don't go in the ocean.  No?  No ocean?  Oh my god.  The ocean is the scariest  god damn thing.  There are so many monsters  under there.  The water alone  that whole  what's that thing 
[01:42:30]  the riptide  or the undertow  and the rip currents  and you're supposed  to just relax  and be like  okay it's pulling me  this way  I just got to swim  to the side  you don't do that  you're like  sucking in  fucking shrimp  and shit  you're dead.  Nobody does that.  That is so funny.  Yeah.  Just relax  as you're getting  pulled out  and don't know  how far out  you're going to be.  I'm supposed to like  wet my finger  and see which way  it's the fucking  wind blowing  and I'm being brought out  in this current  and it's going to  bring me out  and then swim  sideways  yes sideways 
[01:43:00]  parallel to the shore  until you're out  of the rip current  yeah  no fucking way  sure  no way  put the knife in your teeth  just in case  the sharks get you  and a shark  it's like not only  you're getting eaten  you're drowning  at the same time  it's like  everything but being  lit on fire  it's like the worst  fucking  two out of three  of the worst deaths  ever  and it's not like  there's not options  there's pools  there's lakes  I'll swim in that shit  you know there's  nothing under there  even like a lake  it's just like  lakes are scary too  yeah  that's one of those things 
[01:43:30]  and they don't  give up  they're dead  the water is so cold  that whatever fuck  happens in your intestines  you never float to the top  so you're just  down the bottom  you and a fucking  pirate  from fucking  fucking 400 years ago  that's how you have  to spend eternity  with a fucking pirate  you and a fucking pirate  holy shit  it's a little long  but that could be  a new name  for a member  of Wackbag 
[01:44:00]  me and a fucking pirate  that is horrible  that's classic  you don't  yeah  I did a gig  with a dude  when I was in Green Bay  and he goes  I own some property  so he goes up  to show it to me  and we went up there  and there were bear tracks  and we were 10 feet  from the car  and I just went  right back to the car  he's like  they don't do it  unless they're like  hungry  aren't they usually hungry  because their whole life  is looking for food  pretty much  unless they're having  sex to make more  I've seen you do comedy  you suck at that  so I don't  I'm not going to go 
[01:44:30]  out on a limb  I'm not believing you  yeah your wildlife  skills are just as well  I like going down  like the Bahamas  and going in that water  there  but I never go out  over my head  and still  like you said  it's creepy  you can see down  to your feet  the water's completely  clear  that kind of helps me  out a little  I'm constantly  looking around  I swim out to the  buoys and everything  I did it one time  I went to the  Dominican Republic  and I did that  snorkeling thing  and it's just  all these  schools of fish 
[01:45:00]  were going around  and everybody  said oh my god  it's so beautiful  I'm like dude  this is fucking  bait for bigger fish  and you're swimming  in it  no and you just  see him  every once in a while  when you get near  it just seemed  like a little fish  when it wanted to  bam  it was gone  and I'm fucking  this big lumbering  I snorkel  I mean I would be  you know  you know the  creepiest part of snorkeling  anything that wanted  to kill me  it would have killed you  oh yeah  snorkeling or scuba diving  the creepiest thing  is when you  look off into the  distance under there  and it just 
[01:45:30]  just goes  fades into fogginess  though  and you're just  waiting for something  to come out of it  that's bigger than you  I picture that  Jaws moment  right  when he's in like  the cage  and it goes away  and then it comes  back from the other  side  and slams into it  you're just waiting  you look around  and go I know  something's just  going to come  flying at me  from out of that  haze  plus I also hear  like sharks  from like hundreds  of miles away  when they hear  like a splash  can tell distress  so I'm trying  to calmly  not be attracting  anything  yeah  and you know 
[01:46:00]  damn well  you're looking  through this haze  trying to see  something with  your stupid  landlubber eyes  and the shark  like he's  15 miles away  and sees you  perfectly  like clear as day  some sort of radar  on his neck  knows it's you  knows your food  knows you're scared  yeah  coming at you  at 60 miles an hour  there you are  with your flippers  yeah all that stuff  we're gonna go  snakes  all of it  creepy shit  I'm gonna go  Wisconsin  that's it  Paul  hey how's you guys 
[01:46:30]  doing  alright Paul  go ahead  hey that murky  water shit  scares me too  hey uh  when I lived up  in Alaska  I lived up there  for like four years  and uh  you'd have to be  a nut to go out  in the woods  with pepper spray  and a knife  uh  they always told  everyone up there  you gotta bring  a gun and a dog  cause like  I guess those  animals are so wild  they don't understand  what uh  maybe get dog  the wolf  so they're looking  for more of them  so they kind of  leave you alone  yeah dog is probably  pretty handy to have  if an animal attacks you 
[01:47:00]  uh  and a gun  yeah dog is like  an appetizer  that's like potato skins  that'll hold off  the animal long enough  that's your meat shield  until you can pull  your weapon out  and shoot  don't get attached  to your dog  if you're gonna be  using him for this purpose  and as he's getting  eaten by the animal  as the animal's mouth  is full of your dog's throat  then you fire a few rounds  into his head  not caring if you  hit your own dog  because you really  didn't love him  this is a good question  for Anthony  Chris go ahead  I don't fall off 
[01:47:30]  Chris turn down  your radio and talk to us  let's go  yeah I wanted  I wanted to know  if y'all were spooning  with that one jacket  that leaned to  yes we were spooning  were you spooning Anthony  no we slept on  separate sides  of the lean to  of course  you didn't sleep though  I dozed off  a couple of times  but let me tell you  something  how creepy it is  it was raining  very cold rain  thunder and lightning  and so I'm laying  in the lean to  and so I got  you guys were lucky  to find the lean to  very 
[01:48:00]  very  and it was  hypotherm  it was just  we couldn't make  any fire though  so it was still  very cold  why  you've watched Survivor  stop it  everything's soaking wet  and in ideal conditions  it's impossible  to make a fire  what would you do  to start a fire  you think  I think  if everything was dry  would you attempt  to start a fire  probably  I would have  looked for  any kind of  string  that was around  and made a bow  and tried to wrap  a straight piece 
[01:48:30]  of wood  and then use  another piece of  wood with a little  rut cut in it  and then put the  straight piece  with the bow  and grab a rock  with some kind of  indent  and put it on top  of the straight piece  and then with a bow  back and forth  real quick  try to make some  friction in the other  piece of wood  yeah that would have  worked  we saw that  on Survivor  it wouldn't have  worked  by the way  it's a talent  that takes a lot  of practice  so I'm laying there  in the lean to  and now I got a  sideways view  of the world  because I'm kind 
[01:49:00]  of laying down  it's very creepy  and with each  lightning bolt  the whole woods  lit up  it's like a horror movie  we're just waiting  for that face  you're just waiting  for that face  you see the face  for the split second  then it's pitch dark  yes  I was waiting  holy crap  not even so much  where the face  would be right  by your face  but in the distance  at the tree line  by where this  little clearing  for the lean to was  every time it lit up  I would just expect  to see some horrific 
[01:49:30]  silhouette  of the person  that's going to kill us  yeah  evil dead  some type  just zombie  anything  this is actually  making me want to  take like a survival  class  because I really  you know  if something ever  happened and like  the whole system  just failed  I would last  literally  like about  18 minutes  walking around  the woods  it was like  your laptop  still believing  that the system  was coming back  that would be  my lean to  that would be  my lean to  I'd just open it up  and stick my  big head underneath it 
[01:50:00]  what if you saw  like red eyes  out in the woods  dude  I would have  freaked out  I was on the brink  on the brink  the entire time  and then  the night  it took so long  like  it got dark  I guess  at about 7 o'clock  so  by 7 o'clock  we're in this lean to  and I know  we're not going to be able  to move  for 12 hours  until the sun  comes back up  so you'd nod off  and then like 
[01:50:30]  wake back up  and I go  okay  how long was that  I'd look at my watch  and it's like  I nodded off  last time I looked  at the watch  maybe it was  9 o'clock at night  it was like  9.15  I'd been out  for maybe 15 minutes  I thought it would be  2 in the morning  you should have  taken turns  turns what  someone watch  and the other sleep  no there was no watching  someone's got to be  Charlie Sheen  and see that  Viet Cong  in the distance  click your claim words  that's right  yeah  that's pretty much  what I was expecting 
[01:51:00]  just to see the bushes  kind of come alive  here's the question  I got for you  yeah  when does it get  to the point  where it's every man  for themselves  oh where I would have to  tough question  I understand  because you know  you love your chicken stuff  but when does it  you're in that situation  survival instinct  when do you  how far does it get  or how bad does it get  before you decide  it's every man  for themselves  well I think  if either one of us  snapped a leg  or something  I think then  the other one  just has to go  bear's coming  leave the other one  bear's coming  she doesn't run 
[01:51:30]  as fast as you  let's say  are you waiting  no I told her  stay there  because I was walking  kind of a little ahead  and when I saw the bear  I turned around  and just said  stay right there  don't move  and the bear  like  but everyone has  that breaking point  where you have to go  into every man  for themselves  no  with him limping along  like Dustin Hoffman  and Papillon  with my  I was cobbled  it was worse than that  it was worse than that  I was like  James Caan  and what movie was that  I'm your biggest fan 
[01:52:00]  in Misery  Misery  sure  yeah  I'm your number one fan  I was like hobbled  both ankles  were useless  because you're climbing  the whole day  before  we were climbing up  rocks and stuff  and you're using  a lot of your leg muscles  and then to just stop  in the cold rain  and sleep  there was no stretching  yeah I'm going to  stretch this out now  yeah  I'm petrified  it's raining  and we're lost in the woods  but I'm going to do  my stretching  you just want to make  yourself look real small  I was exhausted  so we just 
[01:52:30]  you know  crapped out  for as long as we could  and then waking up  the next morning  my legs  I was like  oh my god  I'm not going to be able  to walk out of here  I am crippled  I need a wheelchair  but then you know  after walking a little while  you kind of get better  but then we saw  like little things  they were trails  that I guess people use  for hiking  but god knows when  or you know  when you're ever going to  see another person  so there were these  little things  nailed to a tree  we found one  it looked like a mailbox  an old wooden mailbox 
[01:53:00]  and you lift it up  and it had like  you could leave  notes there  and it had like  a map and things  and that's how we realized  which way we had to go  and we left a note  walking this way  on trail  lost  but we had to leave  a little note in there  and then  they had pencils  inside this little thing  and left a little note  and  it was a very  harrowing experience  well Ray in California  has a question for you too  Ray go ahead  hey Anthony  hey  are you really going to 
[01:53:30]  give your pug-a-doodle  up to the bear  well you know  the pug-a-doodles  are so cute  that I would have  a problem with that  hey Anthony  I got a better idea  I'll give you my ex-wife  does that work  oh an ex-wife  would have been perfect  I'd have lobbed her bodily  into the bear's mouth  I'd have been like  bear  yo  you've been chumming  for bear  all right  hey Fred  hey thanks for taking  the call  Fred in Arizona  hey thanks 
[01:54:00]  I know Jimmy's listening  so happy birthday Jimmy  and  the Ramon thing  can you explain that  I missed that day  the inside joke  yesterday  it was absolutely hilarious  the Ramon caller  Ramon  maybe  maybe  one day we'll do  inside joke day  and explain some of  these inside jokes  I know that really  he was spitting  with little boy scouts  well Ramon is  we have to explain this again  is Steve's imaginary  little  little  butt buddy  well  not really 
[01:54:30]  when we first started here  we needed production pieces  you know those little  things you hear  during our commercial breaks  for the Opie and Anthony show  little teaser  things like that  for the show  little promo for the show  and Steve was putting  these things together  and it was  various different ideas  that he would just  pull out of his ass  and come up with  one of these things  was the Ramon concept  it was this  this fictional characters  one of them is a rich  voiceover guy  who might be 
[01:55:00]  that guy you hear  for the movie trailers  and stuff  and he does  voiceover work  from a home studio  and he has a big mansion  and inside that mansion  he doesn't do much work  his houseboy Ramon  does all the work  and the gag is  that this guy  is doing  a promo  for the Opie and Anthony show  and in the middle of it  something bad happens  and he needs Ramon's help  to solve whatever problem  it may be  some are  an example  he crapped himself  and crap  went all over his shoes 
[01:55:30]  so in the middle of doing  his Opie and Anthony promo  he goes  Ramon  clean this up  or clean off my shoes  or whatever the fuck  one that was  and then  it was like a series  that started  where  different disgusting things  would happen  and Ramon would have  to clean up  and it got to the point  Fred we hated it  so much  that we'd all walk around  and just go  Ramon  so  Jimmy took it  to the next level  and now he  fucks with some  of our guests  by  saying he's Steve 
[01:56:00]  from Yellowstone  yeah  and he does the bit  for the person  that's in studio  and the person  has no clue  where it came from  laughed out loud  in the office  that was hilarious  yeah  alright  thanks Fred  hey I know  that he's  spooning with  little boy scouts  alright  thank you  let's say hi  to Tom  Tom what's up  hey how you doing  hey man  I got a story  about diving  in the Bahamas  last year  we do a lot  of diving  and we go to  Stewart's Cove  in Nassau Bahamas  and we were 
[01:56:30]  on a dive trip  and my buddy  and I were in the water  and we went out  over a drop off  drops off  about 5,000 feet  and we were  about 120 feet  down  and I got my back  to the open water  and he's looking  at me  and he gets  this sheer look  of terror on his face  to the point  where he can't  even lift his arms  and he's pointing  at me  trying to point  at me  and I turn around  and there's  this 30 foot  whale shark  about 5 feet  from the back  of my head  just swimming by  and I turned  around to find him 
[01:57:00]  and he's on his way  up to the surface  already  you know  because he couldn't  I guess he freaked out  couldn't deal  with the man  aren't whale sharks  like as big as  they're huge  but they don't hurt you  no they're actually  vegetarians  they don't eat  all they eat  is plankton  yeah but when you  see something like  that in the water  when you're diving  it doesn't matter  I mean you hear  stories about  we got a lot  of guys in  you hear stories  about them  and the average  sizes are  you know  20 to 30 feet  and they get  as big as  45 50 feet  when you get  one close up  to where you  can pretty much 
[01:57:30]  reach out  and touch it  I don't care  how many stories  you hear  you know  it gets pretty  no I don't care  what it is  there shouldn't  be stuff the  size of dinosaurs  around you  it was fucking  huge and the  only thing that  compares it out  was a manta ray  swimming at us  with a mouth  the size of  a volkswagen  you know which  is another thing  that doesn't eat  you but you  could easily  crawl inside  this thing  this open  you have any  stories about  animals that  could eat you  that swam  towards you  and this 40  pound goldfish  I mean 
[01:58:00]  when I say  this thing was  puckering  as it came at us  I mean  I thought I was  going to have  a hickey  from my forehead  to my waist  I know they  can't eat you  but still  still we're  scared  we're going  to Arcadia  six fathoms  we're going  to Arcadia  main where  this guy does  gray white  diving inside  a cage  so I don't  know I'll  call back  I'll call  back or not  after that  happens  alright thank  you Tom  thanks  I don't care  if it doesn't  eat meat  in that situation  you're pretty 
[01:58:30]  scared  of course  it's just  that he went  to another  one  that's why  I stay in  the house  these days  Rob in  New Jersey  I don't like  the woods  hey Rob  how you doing  yeah  every man  for himself  I live in  West Milford  and we had  a bear  in our yard  I seen the  thing  I took off  and I pushed  my girl  out of the way  that's a  relationship  ender  right there  I'm telling  you though  everyone has  that point  though  in them  where it's  every man  for themselves  what is it  everyone should

[02:00:00]  no there  weren't  we were  very quiet  come on  there was  no talking  no it was  just  because if we  talked I  think the  subject would  have come  up like  people die  like this  this is  great  this is  what you  read about  you know  so we  just kept  kept walking  we found the  big drippy  water tree  and was  like oh  hey we  should drink  some of  this  and you  know  you're a  harry potter  it was  found the  big drippy  water  big drippy  water tree  no it was  thank god

[02:10:30]  where a poor  Irish kid  finally gets  a break  oh right  away  what is  that  in a world  what are you  using  that the  mister  microphone  you got  there  pally  in a world  where a poor 
[02:11:00]  Irish kid  finally gets  a break  I'm Opie  I'm insecure  of my own  personality  so I got  into a radio  and an Italian  immigrant  gets a new job  I used to fix  air conditioners  now I'm on the radio  and they allow  a small-time comedian  to hijack their show  I'm Jim Norton  I distract Anthony  by using the same joke  every five seconds  and therefore  make him less funny  and they blame  all their troubles  on one Jewish DJ 
[02:11:30]  hey Anthony  let's rip off  that hook-nosed  bastard  and start a radio  war with him  wow that's a good  idea Opie  Opie and Anthony  the movie  coming this fall  hey  anyone else  want some spaghetti  holy shit  is that awful  this is when you know  you're doing  a bad impression  is you have to say  who you're doing  I'm Opie  his Anthony  this is Anthony  his Anthony 
[02:12:00]  and Jim Norton  the exact same  same impression  and neither of which  sounded  even remotely  like either of us  well maybe the next  one's good  you guys didn't like  that one  I don't think  he liked us  see that's kind of  the vibe I got  from that one  I think Ray's pissed off  because I think  he hands in a lot  of stuff  and we don't get  to it usually  obviously  now we know why  so maybe he has  turned on  hey Anthony  you want some  spaghetti  spaghetti  because he's  Italian  and that's what 
[02:12:30]  they eat  all the time  and I might be  5% Irish  maybe  maybe  hi I'm Opie  I'm Opie  oh  what are you  doing  come on  I'm Opie  you want  some spaghetti  Jim Norton  here  and I was  with a hooker  last night  yeah  jerk  yeah  alright well  the next

[02:20:30]  to go forward  is to go back  go back  ugh  ugh  that's right  the movie sucks  in a world  alright  they also  a while back  a big one was  in a small town  there's always that one  that time forgot  let's go to Mr. Hughes  Mr. Hughes  yeah what the fuck  was up with that  first trailer man  was that the guy  from Silence of the Lamps  it puts the audio  in the fucking basket  it does this 
[02:21:00]  when it's old  what the fuck  is that guy  trying to do man  sounded like  he was trying to  fucking  sounded like  he was trying  to be like  the guy  from Silence of the Lamps  wait he was trying  to be like what  he's trying to be  like the guy  from Silence of the Lamps  who was in that  fuck I don't know  I never seen  the movie  and how would you  know he's trying  to be like the guy  if you've never  seen the movie  and what movie  was it again  because your phone  keeps crapping out  Silence of the Lamps  Silence of the Lamps 
[02:21:30]  fuck  good lord  god  did you hear  how he knew  he was bombing  and kept talking  and he just kept  going back  so he got  from Silence of the Lamps  blah blah blah  nothing  you know  because of Silence of the Lamps  dude it's over  he did the put it  in the basket line  it flopped 
[02:22:00]  hey you know  what we haven't  talked about yet  what we were  talking about  in the office  about Tara Reade  and all that  oh right  her show  Terrible  what is it called  Tara Dice  Tara Dice  terrifying  oh it's so bad  it's the old  Wild On  show they used  to do  on E  same thing  where they send her around  Wild On E  or whatever  yeah and Brooke Burke  used to talk  all the time  you know  and do like  the whole segments  and she's so bad  they have like  17 montages  and they'll just 
[02:22:30]  come to her  you know  this is where  life began  and she's like  wow  you guys  that's amazing  that's crazy  this is insane  I took a peek  the other day  I couldn't believe  how awful she looked  and she won't do  anything either  this is like  no  no that's crazy  you guys  yeah she's in like  these far away places  and she's supposed  to participate  in some activities  and she doesn't  no she won't  she won't  there's two episodes 
[02:23:00]  I've seen  anything that they're doing  she was supposed  to run with the bulls  no  no  I was gonna  and then I was  just like  I'm not gonna  I was just like  it's like  how are you  building a show  around this  and then she'll laugh  like  camel unfilters  yeah she's known  for just smoking  like crazy  and she had that  that um  what how do they  what do they call  that voice  when they want it 
[02:23:30]  to sound like  it's something sexy  oh that smoky voice  yeah Demi Moore  description  yeah  yeah there's a way  you put it  that sounds sexy  and maybe when  you know a few years  back  when she was doing  those American Pie  movies I guess  it was kind of cute  now it's just  reached the point  where it really  reminds me of  Lucille Ball  in her final years  when she used  to do Carson  remember you watch  I Love Lucy  as a kid  and she was like  Ricky  we gotta have  Mrs. Trumbull 
[02:24:00]  watch Little Ricky  and I'll meet you  at the club later  and that was Lucy  and then  like  six years later  six years go by  she's on a talk show  well  you know  me and Viv  when we invented  the sitcom  we uh  we uh  never really got along  with Bill Frawley  when me and Desi  started Desilu Studios  like what  what happened  to her voice  she'd be on those  talk shows  with a drink  and a cigarette 
[02:24:30]  the drink  clinking  clink clink  oh Johnny  just  drinking  and smoking  and uh  that's definitely  the road  Tara Reid has taken  she's not gonna be able  to talk  the emphysema  yeah they all  wound up getting it  back then  uh  she died of it  Ricky  I remember seeing um  Desi Arnaz  on a Saturday Night Live  episode  like right before  he died  yeah  he uh  he was on  I don't know  did he host it 
[02:25:00]  I think he was a host  and uh  just ravaged  by the sea  the big casino  got his lungs  because they were  always smoking  in the office  we were talking about  the episodes  I Love Lucy  where uh  they would do  placement  product placement  for Philip Morris  it was a cigarette  company that  sponsored the show  and uh  Lucy would offer  people cigarettes  that came over  the house  in a candy dish  full of cigarettes  that were on  on the table  it's a TV show  they'd be like 
[02:25:30]  wafts of smoke  on the set  you know the  whole studio  probably just stunk  the set had nicotine  dripping down the walls  you'd have to  squeegee off the  camera lens  and Tower Reid's  starting to sound  like uh  Mr. Mooney  we're here in  Papillonas  Bade  I'm not gonna run  with the balls  it's crazy  guys 
[02:26:00]  well I think we have  some tarot audio  here  yeah  let's listen to this  water activities  I went on this  other rap thing  it was called  a fly fish  and it's like  this thing  where everyone  kind of lays down  in it  and it just  flies up in the air  and Mutant Paris  is screaming  you're like  we're so scared  it was so high  that I thought  it was gonna slip  over the other way  I think I broke 
[02:26:30]  my teeth  and my eyeballs  oh my gosh  honestly  we really hurt  each other  and I think  my leg is broken  I have black and  blues on my legs  right here  it was so much fun  we did every  water sport  you could possibly  imagine  people are watching  this shit  she's got one of  those voices  around every 
[02:27:00]  stop talking  then we went  on this thing  it's called  a fly  it's fantastically  fun  like her voice  just cuts out  it's like a  cell phone call  here we are  in Australia  it's wonderful  we're by the  reef  just cuts out  not getting a  signal  good signal  sultry  people are saying 
[02:27:30]  the voice is called  sultry  sultry  Mike on Long Island  what's up Mike  I caught a glimpse  of that show  the other day  it is the most  cool show on TV  all she talks about  is how  how exclusive  she's getting into  and you gotta hear  the person  refer to herself  in person  this is the  terror zone  or the  this is like  it's the most  stop ripping off  Anthony  Anthony  came up with  the voice  that just  you know  craps out  his phone  he's got a  terror voice  voice phone  alright Mike 
[02:28:00]  thank you  here's another clip  it was hysterical  my camera crew  comes in  and then  all these other  camera crews  flashes everywhere  we're like  what is going on  it all happened  at once  and Paris  and Paris  were like  wow she's a big crew  say hi to the camera  I'm sitting there  like who are  all these people  it all happened  so quick  there's like  eight cameras  25 paparazzis  all around the  table  and it was just  like whoa  that's your only  camera  Paris  Paris  that's the only  camera  you know 
[02:28:30]  and then finally  we got everyone  else out  but we kept  ours in  they figured it out  they figured it out  you nailed the  voice  she's got  she tells the  worst story  yeah  and I was like  wow  we had a bigger  cruise in  Paris  who cares  wasn't the whole  thing with the  original show  it was her  going to  bars  like party  locations 
[02:29:00]  yeah  and then what  did they run  out of bars  because now  they try to  make it  more than it  really is  where she's  actually trying  to get culture  some of these  places  I have no  idea  oh my god  oh my god  oh my god  oh my god  oh my god  oh my god  oh my god  oh my god  I've never in my  life tasted  anything better 
[02:29:30]  like we were  flipping out  it was sick  it was amazing  it was so  so good  she has like  three adjectives  in her whole  vocabulary  it was amazing  so so good  you need a show  to have somebody  tell you how  delicious some  food product was  that's what she's  talking about  I never realized  her voice was so  fucked up  all raspy  the other thing is  it all of a sudden  just speeds up  out of nowhere  yeah  she loves the  cigarettes  she must be a  mess to wake up  in the morning  for the next show  just picture her  sprawled out of the 
[02:30:00]  bed in some hotel  room  jizz on the sheets  just reeking  of smoke  jizz in her hair  everything she  owns must just  reek of cigarette  smoke  just her hair  all in disarray  or face all  swollen from the  night partying  what  I need another  hour  no call me  later  I got  sleep  punching the  mirror  getting in a  karate fight  Saigon  I can't

[02:32:30]  about the  plugs  she's looking  like a rock  scientist  holy  I don't  know  I'm learning  too much  stuff  trying to get  a history  lesson  I don't think  that part of  the show  is very good  do you hear  the sound  effects  they actually  make fun  or  yeah  boing  she's so  stupid  see like  potatoes  that's the one  with the potatoes  because I  know  there was a  leader  and  they ran 
[02:33:00]  out of  potatoes  and  I gotta  get some  more  potatoes  is that  the guy  give me  a fucking  drink  fabulous  yeah  Justin  Tennessee  what's up  not much  what's going  on fellas  tell us  okay  I'm wondering  are the  networks just  looking for  the biggest  idiots to do  these shows  nowadays  yes  pretty much  because I  mean MTV  has Ashley  Simpson  and she's  the biggest 
[02:33:30]  no telling  ass clown  I've seen  ever  I mean  they just  put a camera  in front of  her and a  drink in her  hand and  call it a  show  TV is all  about just  finding train  wrecks now  you guys  watch the  Surreal Life  yeah  with Janice  Dickinson  did you see  the one  where  who's the  dude from  Perfect  Strangers  I don't  know  Balky  Balky  starts  called  Brunson  Pinchot  where he  starts  crying  no  really  missed that  one  holy crap  I laughed 
[02:34:00]  so fucking  hard  I know  he's a  fucking  pervert  there's all  sorts of  drama  in the  house  right  between her  and that  fake bitch  Omarosa  from The  Apprentice  she has to be  all edgy  and like she'll  say anything  but you can tell  that's her  character  she's a big  phony  so she has  it out with  Janice  whatever  and so Janice  goes off to  another room  and she admits  to Balky  that her  father was  a pervert  or a pedophile  or something  and so it  made for a  horrendous  childhood 
[02:34:30]  and she's  getting into  it with  Balky  and she's  crying  as she's  admitting  this huge  thing  and what  does Balky  do instead  of comfort  her  he openly  starts crying  harder than  she was  I think he  was trying  to get  into her  pants  that way  I was  laughing  so hard  when this  came on  TV  we gotta  get  the audio  of that  because it  was really  really funny  and then  they have to  console him  when it was  all about  they should  be consoling  this Janice 
[02:35:00]  girl  because she  was going  through this  moment  but Balky  was overcome  by the  whole thing  maybe it  brought back  some kind  of childhood  memory  of something  that happened  to him  because he  now loses  it and  they can't  calm him  down  he probably  is like  oh she's  stealing the  scene  yeah  she's gonna  get the  award  she's getting  more attention  gotta make  this about  me  we have  Tara Reid  on the  phone  Tara  hi boys  hey Tara  wow you  sound sexy  with that  voice  what's up  Tara Reid  I was out  all night

[02:39:30]  only it's  it's like  on the whole length of it  and that pushes  everything down  so when you gas in there  and the gas  squeezes through  one of these  closed sphincter muscles  it sounds exactly  like a fart  only it's inside  right  and sometimes  it could sound  exactly like a fart  like muffled  from the sheets  or something  but no one's  going to be bothered  by it  right  because it just  stinks inside you  oh my god  the fart was inside me  that was amazing  they were looking at me  I was like  you guys  I was with this guy 
[02:40:00]  once and all of a sudden  I thought I had a fart  and it was inside fart  and it almost came out  and then I did fart  and it came out  as a smoke ring  and everyone laughed  and laughed  and I didn't know  I could blow smoke rings  and I fired in the last cigarette  and that was like  15 minutes ago  and I still had a smoke  and it was great  Dirk and the gang  are loving the new  impression  the new Anthony impression  Paul  who knew you could do  Tara Anthony  who knew  horrible whore

We're making them every single day  All you have to do is send a self-addressed stamped envelope  Off to us here in New York City  We'll send out the wow stickers immediately  A little sweatshop of children  Hand-painting them 
[02:46:30]  That's right  In the back office  Somewhere in Thailand  They're making Nike sneakers  And whip them out Wednesday  Pumper stickers  Nickel a day  And then you throw the wow stickers on your car  Or your truck  And this has worked great for many, many years  There's a lot of ladies out there  That are slut bags  And what happens is  They flash you  Because they see the wow in your car  They're lovely women  No, we know that  And they know that  They know we're just joking  Of course  Just to be edgy  Because we're shock, shock, shock, shock, shocking 
[02:47:00]  Shocking  And we haven't been too shocking yet today  So if you want a wow sticker  Yeah, self-addressed stamped envelope  The address is 111 West 57th Street  New York, New York  10019  Nice  Wow, you know it now  And that address is up on opianthony.com if you need it  Okay  I never know the zip here  Like if I've got to fill out a form that says  Place of work  And you put the address down  I just leave it out  New York, New York 
[02:47:30]  You figure it out  And we should have a wow hotline in time for  You know, next spring I guess  Yeah, because wow season's only so long  Well, now that we're all over the country  It'll be wow every single day somewhere  Yeah, well, okay  Arizona  That old gag  It's five o'clock somewhere  Alright, shut up  Like when people say that like 15 past the hour  It's noon somewhere  No it isn't  It's a quarter afternoon somewhere 
[02:48:00]  They say that at the bars  When you want a drink  When you have to use that excuse to drink at like 10, 15 in the morning  You're an alcoholic  It's five o'clock somewhere  It's happy hour somewhere  That drunk  Just drink  Yeah, and he's doing it every day  And he's got that hack phrase too  Yeah  Which means inevitably you're going to put the lampshade on your head  To show how wacky you are  This guy's a scream, man  Hang with him all the time 
[02:48:30]  Hey, you guys were bringing up a pretty good point  You know, Hurricane Rita is slowly but surely  Making her way to the Texas coast  Uh-huh  And I mean slowly but surely  Yeah, Bill was saying earlier  He goes, they're showing this in real time  And it sounded like a joke  But no  The news channels  No matter what story they're doing  In the corner  They'll put a picture  The satellite picture of the hurricane  Just on a loop  Scrolling and spinning in the Gulf 
[02:49:00]  Like we need to see it  Constantly until it hits something  I think it's moving three miles an hour  Yeah  It's a hurricane in real time  It's not the most exciting thing to watch on television  They've already done the hacky palm tree blowing in the wind  Yeah  The reporter in front of it  The reporter in front of it  The driving rain  It ran right between Cuba and the Keys  So they had their reporters down there, of course  With the wind blowing 
[02:49:30]  Well, at least, you know, they know it's coming  They've got plenty of  Yeah  Well, then they got the shot inside the grocery store  With all the empty shelves  Because you've got to get ready for the hurricane  Getting ready  We're up to a catch four  Winds 131 to 155 miles an hour  That's what it is  And they say, Opie, this could reach  Category five  And smack into Galveston  Is what it's aiming at  I saw where Galveston is 
[02:50:00]  You see that?  It's a little strip of land off of Texas  And they were talking with an evacuee  From New Orleans  That went to Galveston  Why wouldn't you just  Take a little effort  Go a little more inland  You're on a strip  I've always liked the water  Yeah  I like the water  I'm not going to let it scare me away  Let it scare you  Let it scare you away  It's chasing you now  You should be scared  Run  Get out of there  Stop being so brave  But at least 
[02:50:30]  In this day and age, Opie  We're in, what, 2005  You can see the satellite picture  Of a hurricane constantly  It's not sneaking up on anybody  Who would think something  500 miles wide  Could sneak up on people  But it did back in the olden days  Can you imagine what it was like?  Because we didn't have satellite photos  There weren't weather forecasters  That could tell there was a hurricane coming  It was just some schlep  Sitting in his little 
[02:51:00]  What, log cabin?  Yeah  It's like it's going to rain  Yeah  It was so nice a little earlier  But there's a few clouds moving in  I think I'm going to have to postpone  Seating the back 40  And then out of nowhere  Maybe the wind picks up a little  And you've been through a lot of storms  So it's probably  Ooh, this could be a bad one  Oh, you read those old books too  And you had to like tie yourself to a tree  Yeah  And after the eye passes over 
[02:51:30]  You're like naked  Like it's just ripped everything off of you  There's nothing left  And then it hits  And you're like  Oh boy  This is like something  I can't even say from a movie  Because it's the 1800s  You had to be in a hurricane  To know there was a hurricane coming  To know what this was like  There's not meteorology  Right  There's nothing that can tell these people  What it was like  Just out of nowhere  Yeah, and it hasn't  Yeah, it hasn't been figured out yet  So what are the people thinking back then?  An act of God  Yeah, they must have just ran to the church 
[02:52:00]  Some crazy thing like that, right?  That promptly collapsed on top of all of them  Killing everybody  A church-like mercy  Sure  Yeah  Alright, so we're following Hurricane Rita  In real time now  In real time  On CNN  It's not supposed to make any kind of landfall  Until Saturday afternoon  Saturday morning  Early Saturday morning  Saturday 2 a.m.  And it's Wednesday  Thursday  Friday  24-hour fucking coverage  Yeah  They got it in a pretty straight track 
[02:52:30]  Curving a little north  I would like to see it take a northerly turn  A little sooner  Which would have it barreling into New Orleans  Nah, New Orleans is safe  Who doesn't want to see this hit New Orleans?  It's not a move even like west of Galveston  It's the sequel we've all wanted  It's like when they made the Matrix part 2 and 3 back to back  At the same time  So you could see it like really quickly in the theater  You don't have to wait a couple of years for the movie  That's what I like  A quick sequel  Yeah, the first one's already on like on demand 
[02:53:00]  Yeah, but sequels suck  This is like Caddyshack too  There's been a couple of good  Like very few  They're starting to get better finally  In recent years the sequel has  That's because they film them all at the same time  It's got the same feel  With a continuing storyline  Like Lord of the Rings  Has a part 3 to anything ever been good?  Very rarely  Yeah  What about the Godfather?  Godfather  Come on  Godfather  Part 3  That was worse than Jaws 3 
[02:53:30]  Jaws 3  Because that was 3D, wasn't it?  They had to do the 3, 3D  And then the 4 was like  Now it's personal  She was being  The wife there  Brody's wife was the star  She was the last one left  And the star  And the shark was pretty much chasing her  That's when you know it's going to suck  When even people from the original cast  Nobody's left  And they're like out of work  And they're still like no  Yeah, they said no  No, I'm not doing Jaws 9  And the worst person in the movie 
[02:54:00]  The one that had like nothing in the first movie  She's the big star  In the part 4  And the shark was chasing her  Now wouldn't  That's a pretty easy thing to get away from  Just move to Arizona  Arizona  I could say you could still live  Within sight of a beach  And be fine  Oh, good point  You could taunt the shark  Right  You could fuck with him  What was the reasoning that she had to be in the water?  Or the whole movie would fall apart, of course 
[02:54:30]  Of course she had to go in the water  I don't remember  Does anyone know?  That was the big like sticking point  When they were writing that awful script  How do we get her in the water?  Gotta get her  There's gotta be a reason  God, she's petrified of it  Her whole family  She wants  She wants to take a kayak  A kayak  Get the shark  Everyone she knew  Was pretty much killed by the shark  But she  Had to go in the water  For some reason  Did she have to like  Get the demons out of her?  Oh, like confront  Confront her demons? 
[02:55:00]  Confront it  And perhaps  Now I need to know why she had it on the water  Did Brody ever die?  Did Brody ever die from the shark?  Jaws the Revenge  No, he like died  Of a heart attack, I think  But she always blamed it on the stress of the shark  And like  The son got killed  Exactly  He didn't have to go down that road  If they had a good script  He would have  He would have made the movie  A man-eating shark  Let's see  Ellen Brody still lives in the island resort town of Amity  And her sons  Sean and Michael  Don't work at SeaWorld anymore 
[02:55:30]  And some time ago  Ellen's husband  Died of a heart attack  That happened  Because he was afraid of sharks  Sean is now a deputy in Amity  One night during the Christmas season  Sean is called to  Untangle a log  From a buoy  And when Sean goes to the buoy  He's killed by  A great white  After hearing about this  Michael  Who was studying to be  A marine biologist  Visits Amity  With his wife  And five-year-old daughter  While wanting to get away from Amity  And spend Christmas with Michael  Carla and Thea and Ellen  Go  With them to their house  In the Bahamas 
[02:56:00]  On an airplane  Whose pilot  Is  Hoagie  Hoagie starts falling for Ellen Brody  Michael's friend Jake  Who's also studying to be a marine biologist  Lives next door  Anyone getting this?  I don't know  If you were pitching this  I'd pass  It's horrible  Let's see  Sometime later  When Michael and Jake  Are out to sea  Their boat is attacked  By the shark  That killed Sean  Michael and Jake  Trying to tag the shark  So it can be kept track of  Sometimes later  Friends are on a banana boat  The yellow shaped thing  You've seen them out there  The shark attacks the banana boat 
[02:56:30]  Kills a woman  Leaving Thea in shock  But it looks like Thea will be okay  Carla's mad at Michael  For not telling her  That the shark  Was in the water  Off the Bahamas  Michael and Jake  Didn't mention the shark  Because they  Didn't want to upset Ellen  And mess up her visit  Ellen believes  The shark is after her family  And that was  Trying to kill Thea  Instead of the woman it killed  So Ellen takes  Michael's boat  Out to sea  On a single minded mission  To find the shark  And kill it  While Michael  Hoagie and Jake  Try to find Ellen  Because they're afraid  The shark will kill Ellen 
[02:57:00]  Before Ellen  Can kill  The shark  So her kid  And her kid's friends  Being marine biologists  Are going to be in the water  What a great profession to choose  And she feels  Jesus  That as long as they're  Marine biologists  And being in the water  The shark is going to  Track them down  And kill them  So her mission now  Is to take her own life in danger  Go out on the water 
[02:57:30]  Kill the sharks  So her family is safe  Is there a spoiler there?  How does it end?  The original is the only good one  Even Jaws 2  When all the boats  Got entangled  That dude from room 222  With the afro  Afro  Just so badly  Wanted him not to survive  And he did  Really horrible  And Chief Brody  Had to have like a  Catchphrase line  At the end  When he held up  The electric cable  That the shark bit into  Like what did he say?  What was his big line  At the end of that?  I don't remember 
[02:58:00]  Oh that was big in the 80's  To have like those  Those horrible lines  Well in the first one  It was smile  You son of a bitch  And then he shoots the tank  And blows the shark up  The second one  Was something ridiculous  Like he holds the cable up  And he's like  Time for dinner  Or like  It was something  Ridiculous  Maybe it's in memorable quotes  From  IMDB  It's like those awful  Schwarzenegger movies  In the early 80's  He always had some awful joke  After he killed somebody 
[02:58:30]  He threw this guy  Into some sort of like  Like this pipe  And all this smoke come off  That impaled him  And he goes  Okay  Let off some steam  Let off some steam  Anthony was it  Alright you big bastard  I've got something for you now  Come on  Open wide  Say ah  That was it  Open wide  Say ah  Like anyone  Would say that  That was actually  In the movie  Say ah  We got the ending 
[02:59:00]  Of Jaws 3  From Jeremy  In Houston  Jaws 3  We're talking about  Jaws 4  The revenge  Jaws 4  Jaws 4  She's on a boat  And she takes  Like the stick  On the end of the boat  I guess  It sticks out  And sticks it  Through the shark  And  Oh the little thing  That sticks out  Of the front of a boat  Yeah  And they have  Some electronic thing  She shocks him  He comes out of the water  They impale the shark  And the shark dies  And everything's fine  But did it die?  Ah  Apparently so  Because they didn't 
[02:59:30]  Make another one  So it died finally  It's pretty horrible  Oh it dies after everyone  Dies in everyone  Are you worried  About the hurricane?  I know but it always  Had babies or something  There's something going on  Joking about the hurricane  Yeah we're going to  Stay off work  It's going to be great  You know  Let's have a hurricane party  And last night  It was a category of four  Everybody's going to go  I'm going to Austin  I'm going to Dallas  I'm not staying  Everyone's leaving  It's going to be ugly bro  Yeah  What are you going to do?

I like how we were cleaning stuff up  From yesterday  And we played something  We had played the day before  What was it?  I don't know what it was  We have the Deep Throat clips 
[03:01:00]  Hmm  What are those?  Well  Just clips from the movie Deep Throat?  Yeah remember how stupid the dialogue was  Oh yeah  That sucked though  Yeah  Well we have the rocker  We did that already though  We have  TV edits from the Blues Brothers  We never got to  Oh I like TV edits  We have Mumbles Menino  Mayor Menino  Me too okay  Now we're talking  Got a couple things here  Little Marky  Jesus put the stars in the sky 
[03:01:30]  I don't think we ever played this  No  We haven't played a Little Marky  In a long time  We can start with Little Marky  And that would clean up this area  Very nicely  You want to hear an annoying voice  You want to explain to Bill Burr  What Little Marky is about?  Little Marky  They're these little  I don't know what you'd call them  Little audio vignettes  Little plays  It's Little Marky  And it's very Catholic church oriented 
[03:02:00]  Teaches the Christian kids  Yeah  Teaches them  Life lessons  About parents that drink  And how you know  They have to stop  In order to raise their kids  Okay  Teaches them about the evils of abortion  We played one Little Marky  And it's Little Marky  Actually in the womb  And he's talking about  How wonderful it is  That he's growing  And how  Through the whole thing  He keeps talking about  How he can't wait  To meet and kiss his mommy  And he hears his mommy's heartbeat 
[03:02:30]  And feels the warmth  Of her love inside  And then he gives like dates  He goes  November 25th  My eyes are forming  That's amazing how this kid  Can already speak  Yeah he's talking in the womb  Wait did you  Did you give the punchline  No  Oh we should just play it then  Because we have a whole bunch  Of new listeners  Okay go ahead  No because then Bill  Can be shocked like everyone else  And then we can play  The new Little Marky  Yeah okay  Play that Little Marky  By the way  A lot of people are mentioning 
[03:03:00]  On the Instant Feedback  As they find that clip  That at the end of Jaws 4  When they kill the shark  That he makes a noise  Like T-Rex  Really?  Is that true?  Lame  That's hilarious  I bet it is  Yeah  Like he screamed or something  Like he was in pain  Flapping around on the front of the boat  That's all you do  Let's get Eric in here  Eric  Eric is going to find  Oh wow  They can't  They can't play Eric's music 
[03:03:30]  Why can't they play Eric's music?  He's got this new thing  Where he runs in  They're looking for a clip  Oh really?  That was the only reason?  He runs in  And tries to beat his music  Got it?  Oh look at you  This better be the right one  There goes Eric  Alright yeah  That's the one  Alright listen to this  Hit it  October 2nd  Today  My life begins  My parents do not know it yet  I am as small as the pollen of a flower 
[03:04:00]  But it is I already  I will be a boy  I will have blonde hair and blue eyes  Nearly everything is settled already  October 19th  I have grown a little  I have grown a little  But I am still too small  To do anything by myself  My mother does everything for me  Although she still does not know  That she is killing me under her heart  But I am a real person  Just as a cup of bread is still real great  My mother exists and I do too 
[03:04:30]  October 23rd  My mouth is just now beginning to open  Just think  In a year or so  I will be laughing  Or later I will start to talk  My first word will be  Mama  October 25th  Today my heart began to beat  It will beat softly for the rest of my life  Never stopping  After many years  It will tire  And stop  Then I shall die  November 2nd 
[03:05:00]  I am growing continually  My arms and legs are taking shape  But I must wait a long time  Before these tiny legs will raise me  To my mother's arms  November 12th  Tiny fingers are beginning to form on my hands  How small they are  One day I will stroke my mother's hair  And tell her how nice she is  Creepy  November 20th  Only today the doctor told my mother  That I am living here under her heart  How happy she must be  Are you happy mother? 
[03:05:30]  November 25th  Today is Thanksgiving  My mother and father are probably  Thinking about a name for me  And they don't even know  That I am a little boy  So they are probably calling me Barbara  But I want to be called Andy  I am growing so big  December 10th  My hair is growing  It is as bright and shiny as the sun  I wonder what kind of hair my mother has 
[03:06:00]  December 13th  My eyes are almost fully developed  Although the lips are still shut  When mother brings me into the world  It will be full of sunshine  And overflowing with flowers  I have never seen a flower you know  I have never seen a flower you know  But more than anything  I want to see my mommy  How do you look mommy?  December 24th  I wonder if my mother hears the delicate beat of my heart  Some children are born with sickly hearts  And then the gentle fingers of a doctor performs miracles to make them healthy 
[03:06:30]  But my heart is healthy  It beats so evenly  Tup, tup, tup, tup  You shall have a healthy son, mother  December 28th  Today  My mother showed me  That's terrific  That's terrific  Oh it gets worse  Why did you kill me for me? 
[03:07:00]  Oh my god  When God made me special for you  Can you fucking believe this?  I really wanted to see you  And put my little arms around you 
[03:07:30]  Why did you kill me mommy?  Because I thought you really killed for me  You get nothing  You lose  Good day sir  What I would have grown up to be 
[03:08:00]  I guess I'll never know  Because mommy  You killed me  Wow  Who saw that coming, huh Bill?  That is unbelievable  Play it for the kids  Play it for the kids  That's what the kids want to hear  There you go 
[03:08:30]  Wow  That was disturbing  I like the guy playing the keyboards too  Yeah it got real ominous there on December 26th, 28th  It sounded like a little something that you do to play for Paul Simon in the mid-70s  Yeah  That must have been  Went on to that gig  Kind of fell off a little bit  Well  Got an abortion gig for you  We have a brand new little Marky  Why  Did you kill 
[03:09:00]  Me  Mommy  The character is a little Marky  So there's another one  I have no idea  How does it keep singing if it killed him?  I have to do the song I wanted her to  Is that like pro or against abortion?  I can't tell  A boot to the stomach on this broad  Well we have another one called  Jesus put the stars in the sky  November 28th  My penis is starting to develop  The balls are hanging real low  December 30th 
[03:09:30]  I'm in a dumpster out back of the clinic  But I'm still yapping  Why?  Did you throw me in a dumpster?  Mommy  I'm sitting in a biohazard bag  Waiting for the truck to haul me away to the incinerator 
[03:10:00]  Meeting all my new friends  This is bad  I don't want to do this  It is bad  But Jesus  No this is bad  I'm in a bag of arms and legs  Oh  That's bad  See  I just wanted the example of real bad  Excellent job  Thank you  All right  Let's hear the latest creation from Will Marky  Listen  Did you know that Jesus made you  And me 
[03:10:30]  And flowers  And trees  And animals  And everything  I'm going to tell you about it right now  Jesus made the fuzzy little bees  Jesus made the butterflies and trees  How about that  Toads and flocks and junk  Camels with funny hands  He even made that silly little flame  Jesus made the birds to sing 
[03:11:00]  Designed the natural bodies with wings  Provided a way for them to live each day  Jesus  He took care of everything  Jesus put the stars in the sky  The moon and the sun will close by  And he'll put a new heart in you 
[03:11:30]  All you've got to do is  Ask him to  That's all you've got to do  Just ask  Take a look around  And you will see  The hurricane is heading right for me  I really should have played that  New Orleans  Yeah  I don't know  I thought God put the stars right  Yeah  Just his kid  Yeah  Jesus didn't do that  I mean  He's pretty amazing 
[03:12:00]  Jesus just kind of spread the word  Jesus was pretty you know  Active and did a lot of cool stuff  But he didn't do all that  He was active in the community  Yeah  He built tables and stuff  Had charisma  Yeah  He was a carpenter  But I don't think he actually  Put the stars in the sky  But God was the one that did that stuff  Yeah he did all that  All the heavy lifting  Did they actually play that abortion thing  Two little kids  They had to be  Because that was definitely not for adults  It's like  Well why would you play it for little kids  They made it  To like pound it into their head 
[03:12:30]  That they shouldn't do this  When they get older  Yeah  I mean is that supposed to appeal  To an adult  Why  Mommy  Mommy  I just want to meet my mommy  You'll meet her for two seconds  Start talking now  Better get it all out  Yep  That's it 
[03:13:00]  And vacuum don't leave much time for hugging  Oh man  I hate to be the realist here but  We all know they don't just  Can we blame this segment on Rich Voss not showing up?  Of course we can  You want to go back to this song?  It is this point  Let me see where he goes with it  Was made perfectly  Just thank him every day  For all the things he's done  He made it all for you and me 
[03:13:30]  Before we get to the next verse  We got some phone calls coming in  We have to say hi to Jerome  Hey Jerome, what's up?  What's going on?  Hey  Well just wanted to know if Jesus made the niggers  Oh god damn it  Why?  I'd love to see that guy actually say that  Holy cow  Same joke in front of a room full of black people  Watch him  Hey guys  Who are you?  Hey  I got something  Probably start bringing up basketball  Trying to relate  Yeah  Kyle 
[03:14:00]  See that Knicks game?  I can be friendly  What's up Kyle?  What's going on?  That little Marky thing man  That's freaky  Hey  I was actually calling to tell you  That the  In Jaws 4  That's right  The funniest part of the whole movie is  That shark does scream actually  When she kills it  And does like a lion's roar  Really?  Yeah  It's like the funniest part of the whole movie  Well somehow when you told it  It's 10 minutes too late guy  Yeah  Maybe we should find that clip  Alright 
[03:14:30]  Let's get back to the song  Oh Jesus put the stars in the sky  The moon and the sun will cross by  And Jesus makes everybody die  All you got to do is  Ask you too  Yeah  All you got to do is  Ask you too  All you gotta do is

[03:17:30]  Into the sewer system  10 a.m.  I fell on Jimmy Norton's chest  I wasn't sure if that was actually the tape for a second  That was pretty good when I just did that  You gotta hear Anthony's new Tara Reid impression man  Yeah I gotta hear it again in order to run through  Yeah I know  It's one of those that'll take a while  I'm not putting you on the spot  Listen on the replay Jimmy  To the Tara Reid impression  It's pretty funny  I could see it turning into Joan Rivers 
[03:18:00]  I have my Wi-Fi  Because it's in a box in my manager's office  I'm still living in a hotel  What's her name?  Wah wah wah  Oh cut it out  How was Rich Voss' wedding?

No I'm not 
[03:19:00]  It was behind a rest area  His wedding photos were taken  And uh  Yeah it was nice  Wow they really spared no expense  Is it  Is this just a small town in Canada  In the middle of nowhere?  It was a rest area  It was a fucking rest  Guys went there to piss and shit  And then get back in their trucks and leave  And he's standing behind it  On the most important day of his life  On the front of a picnic table  Wow hold on a minute 
[03:19:30]  He's calling in now  Uh  Rich  Here's the thing  Norton was scared to take the pictures there  Because you're scared somebody would recognize them  Coming out of the rest area  First of all  The pictures came out beautiful  Wait till you see them  Uh  That's one  It was just a  Because they were using a big green patch of grass  I don't know  I'm not familiar with the area  Was it a rest area?  Yeah  I think it was  You think it was?  What do you mean you think of course it was? 
[03:20:00]  Well  You know what  Like all those little maps  Of like what  Like when you get into a place  Those little welcome maps  And then there was a men's room  And a ladies room  That was it  It was more of a rest area  Catered by Sparrows  The photographer  The photographer said  Meet us  Meet me at this spot  You know  She knew where there was a good spot  To take the pictures  You can't tell  I mean when you look at the pictures  In between exit 8 and exit 9  Yeah  Photographer's just looking for any patch of grass  They were on a medium strip  You know  And  What do you call it 
[03:20:30]  Then after the  What do you call it  The rehearsal dinner  I had to drive Norton around  For like  You know  An hour  Trying to find him  A down pillow  You know  He said he could only sleep  On a down pillow  Or a black penis  And we couldn't find either of them  For an hour  That was a good line  You know what  You can kiss my ass  That was a good line  It wasn't  And I really  Norton gave a great speech  At the wedding  It was hilarious  And we would be hearing it  If you came in today  To the show  I will
