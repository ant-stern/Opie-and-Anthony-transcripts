<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie complaining about computer viruses, leading to a discussion about email safety.  The main focus quickly shifted to a recap of their "Homeless Shopping Spree" from the previous day.  The hosts, along with in-studio guests Ben, Rick, and Jim Norton, reviewed the overwhelmingly positive listener response and showcased photos and videos from the event on their websites.  Humorous anecdotes were shared, including tales of Ziggy's enthusiastic mall bathroom usage and Tippy Tom's drunken antics, captured on video and described with explicit detail.  Numerous listener calls followed, many rambling and off-topic, but generally expressing appreciation for the generosity shown and discussing the varied reactions of the homeless participants.  Discussions included the exceeding of the initial budget, the dynamics within the homeless community, and plans for future events, such as bowling or gambling with the homeless.  A stolen bit, a comedic advertisement for "Big Willie Pop," was also discussed.  The segment concluded with more stories from the spree and a brief mention of an upcoming guest, Mario Cantone. Profanity and vulgar language were prevalent throughout.

The show continued with further discussion of the "Homeless Shopping Spree," focusing on an incident on the bus to the mall involving a participant named "Blue" who became aggressive and threatening, prompting intervention from another participant, Mark.  Mark's hoarse voice, attributed to a party and wedding, and a missed appearance on Bill O'Reilly's show were also discussed.  Listener calls included an update from a transit cop, Paul, on Tippy Tom and Rock and Roll Tommy, revealing Tippy Tom’s belongings had been stolen while he slept.  Callers also debated John Walker Lindh, ranging from advocating for his execution to mocking him.  Other tangents included a caller's pigeon-killing experience, Mariah Carey on Letterman, and a caller's "packing" habits.  A significant portion was dedicated to Grand Theft Auto 3, with extensive discussion of its violence, realism, radio commercials, and gameplay strategies, including audio clips from the game.  "Stoner Sean" also called in to discuss the game.

The next segment centered on the Jerry Springer Show, its perceived fakery, and outrageous storylines.  Callers and hosts recounted bizarre episodes, including a woman in love with her washing machine, a daughter wanting to marry her father, and a woman with a hump and clubfoot.  A caller, Rick, revealed he was a planted audience member on Springer, recounting his agreement with a man who claimed infidelity was genetic, and detailing his grandfather's 45 children. Rick’s acting aspirations were discussed, and the hosts pressed him to bring in his Springer appearance videotape and a headshot.  The conversation touched upon the decline in the authenticity of Springer's staged fights, the exploitative nature of teen-focused talk shows like Maury (with accusations of compromising underage girls in NYC), and a caller's encounter with a stripper and a man from the show fabricating storylines.  Another caller described a Springer segment featuring a man with a lower-body amputation.  The segment also covered comedians' websites, including Rich Voss'. Mario Cantone joined the show in-studio, discussing his upcoming performances at Caroline's, his comedic style, and his wedding, sharing anecdotes and jokes about celebrities. The segment concluded with offensive comments about Christmas specials and a proposed urination contest.

The final segment featured Mario Cantone extensively.  He discussed his agoraphobia, contrasting his fear of traveling to the South with his comfort in New York City, and recounted the emotional difficulty of selling his father's house.  His upcoming appearance on *The View* sparked discussions about other guests like Ron Jeremy and Gene Simmons, and Barbara Walters' supposed objections to Jeremy.  The segment included several recurring comedic bits:  a discussion of a drunk Kevin Meaney's webcam feed;  "Day Late Guy"; commentary on Star Jones's endorsements and a wax-removal demonstration; a listener offering their son to Cantone; and calls from other show characters ("Don't Know I'm on the Air Guy", "Overreacting Guy").  Ken Stevens, the station's general manager, delivered a holiday message.  The show ended with the "What Did We Learn?" segment and promotion for Cantone's shows, along with mocking of a Sam Adams beer representative, Lisa, present in the studio. The segment, like the rest of the show, contained frequent crude humor, sexual innuendo, and offensive language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the Okie and Anthony Show!  Hello!  Hello!  Hey, it's time for commercials!  I love them!  That's a little clip from Grand Theft Auto 3, Anthony.  I've got a place on that stuff for you today.  In the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, give us a call, please. 
[00:00:30]  866-277-4WOW.  That's 866-277-4WOW.  Where do we begin today?  I wonder how many viruses have been loaded into this computer that I work at on a daily basis here.  Why?  Because you go to open up a browser, you do anything on this computer,  and the cursor for the mouse just kind of gets all choppy, doesn't move.  Somebody just unloaded something into this about a couple of weeks ago. 
[00:01:00]  More viruses than our own Jim Norton.  Who opens those things?  Who is dumb enough to open something, like an email?  Uh, I need your advice.  What was that one?  Well, the person seemed like they really needed the advice, though.  Was that it?  I send you this to get advice.  Well, alright, let me open it up.  Some kind of executable.  I don't know, can't hurt. 
[00:01:30]  You know, people are so...  I don't know, it said hot chick on it, so I opened it.  So now you're after, uh, you can't get the computer working over there, huh?  I can't get it working, but it's really slow.  Like, I click on the Explorer, and then while Explorer's opening up,  the mouse, as you try to slowly glide it across the monitor,  it goes, dang, dang, dang.  Like, it just clips, and it's awful.  Should we get...  If my computer at home was like this, I would be getting a new one right now.  Should we get Computer Guy? 
[00:02:00]  Throw it out.  Yeah, we should get Computer Guy.  Where's Scott?  And get a concise explanation of what the problem seems to be.  Get Scott, and I will show him.  Because this is something that will happen if I do it right in front of him.  It's not like one of those things where something's broken,  you take it to some expert to show him, and it doesn't happen.  So you get home.  Then it keeps happening.  It's notorious with cars.  Alright, well, while we get to Scott, right off the bat,  thanks for all the email about yesterday's show. 
[00:02:30]  There's no way we're going to be able to write everyone back.  But we read every single piece.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  It seemed like most people out there had a great time listening to the show yesterday,  or participating in the homeless shopping spree too.  Up from the looks of the videotape that came back from yesterday's events.  Wow, a lot of people had fun.  Yeah, we have...  You alright, Ben?  What's making a weird noise?  What's making a noise?  Phones.  Your phones are making a noise?  Yep.  Are they really?  Hold on, hold on.  It's going... 
[00:03:00]  It's just going...  It's clicking a little.  It's a...  This whole place is just an electronic cluster F.  Where's Pete Johnson?  We're a sloppy show, it doesn't matter.  I'll fix the computer.  I'm Pete Johnson.  I pissed off Gene Simmons, but we're a sloppy show.  Yeah.  Gene was really touchy.  He doesn't understand...  I don't get it.  You hear the noise in the background?  Yeah.  It's just cart machines, you know, for sound effects.  What's wrong with that, though?  What's wrong with that, though?  Sometimes commercials.  He yelled at Steve C. and Mary for talking.  That's what we do.  Ah, Scott. 
[00:03:30]  Scott's here.  Here we go.  Watch.  Computer guy!  Open up Explorer and then move the mouse around as it's opening.  This happens all through the day.  How many windows you got open?  I open about six browsers.  But I've done this before and there's no problem.  It's worked like a charm every time.  I go to various little websites with those.  But open up another one and watch.  See?  Move the mouse.  Move the mouse.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  See?  See what I mean?  Now it's smooth, but it happens throughout the whole day. 
[00:04:00]  It's awful.  Does Scott have a diagnosis?  It never did that before.  I don't know.  Now he's opening my computer, you know, up there.  Because this could be the most exciting damn thing I've ever looked at.  Of course it is.  Sad to listen to.  Who hasn't had this problem?  No problem.  I have.  What were we talking about yesterday, though?  Yeah.  Well, Scott was busy putting pictures up on all the websites from yesterday's show, Anthony.  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  I think we have about 100 pictures up or close to it.  You can go to opieandanthony.com or foundrymusic.com.  I believe they have a link to some of the pictures.  Steve has some video up on foundrymusic.com on the festivities.  Some of the festivities.  Yeah, I was laughing my ass off.  I saw some video of the people yelling at Victoria's Secret because they wouldn't let the homeless shop.  And the people yelling, you suck and F you.  And a-hole, a-hole.  A-hole, a-hole chant.  Very good.  Very nice.  And Ziggy, what a rock star Ziggy was yesterday.  Jay, going from a homeless guy on the street, getting beat up, being cold, hungry, to having money, shopping in a mall, people cheering your name as you get on a bus to go back to your life of being hungry and cold. 
[00:05:00]  Holden.  He has a good life though.  He likes being homeless.  I read an email from someone saying, I can't believe you guys are talking about Ziggy.  I haven't lived in the city in over 10 years.  I remember him from 1979.  79.  Pretty much 1979 he's been living this lifestyle. 
[00:05:30]  So, Ben was with Ziggy yesterday.  Yeah, Ben, you got to grab a mic.  Rick, you got to grab a mic.  Jim Norton in the studio.  Three of the people that went to the mall yesterday for the homeless shopping spree.  And Ziggy took a bird bath, did he, in the bathroom at the mall?  When we called you from the bathroom, he was so excited.  He went in, it was like, he couldn't even believe it.  Like walking into a palace.  He was in the, you know, stall for a while and then he came out and just washed his whole face off and, you know, his hair. 
[00:06:00]  And then he got under the automatic dryer thing.  We stand up there, his hair was going all over the place.  Well, he's got to dry off.  He was looking in the mirror for a while.  We were in the bathroom for a good 20 minutes with him at the end of the festivities.  That's great.  That's classic.  Well, Ziggy, Ziggy a big hit with the rest of the homeless.  Like they give him respect.  Like Ziggy's old school.  When we got back here, it's like everyone, a couple of guys didn't know where the hell we were.  And they're trying to figure it out.  And they're all checking in with Ziggy to make sure he's cool and ready to go home.  And it was really funny. 
[00:06:30]  It's like the hierarchy of all the guys.  The hierarchy of the homeless.  Yeah, the homeless hierarchy.  There really is.  Ziggy is really, when he showed up when we first got him, the amount of respect, they all go right over.  Where would you put Tippy Tom as far as respect goes with him?  He gets done.  He gets no respect.  Like he's swinging at people.  People are swinging at him.  It's awful.  It's awful.  There's a clip up on foundrymusic.com of Tippy Tom screaming and yelling that he is going  to beat the crap out of all you mother effers or kill all you mother effers.  Right. 
[00:07:00]  Because you woke him up, right?  Yeah.  Oh, we got the clip here.  That was good.  Well, I kind of told Rick, because it was getting quiet.  They were all passed out sleeping.  So I asked Rick to put the phone by his mouth and knock on his head.  He was snuggling with a chicken sandwich.  Yeah.  So he was sleeping with that.  All right.  Here's the clip.  You know there's a sandwich on you.  I'm trying to get it.  No.  I don't care no more.  No.  No.  Okay.  My life is over.  I will kill everyone.  I'll take your gun and shoot you in the head and shoot all these mother effers. 
[00:07:30]  And I'll shoot myself.  I guess I'll put a foot over there.  I'll try and take a nap.  You know.  Merry Christmas, everyone.  Oh, my God.  Merry Christmas.  And, Norton, you were stuck on the bus with that lunatic for well over an hour.  Well over an hour.  I wouldn't know.  I didn't even look towards the back of the bus.  The guy is being given money, a bus trip, a little excitement in the life that probably  just includes a couple of city blocks on a daily basis and cold and hungry. 
[00:08:00]  Mm-hmm.  And he's being given some money and a little company, adulation from the crowd, and some  new items.  And he's still yelling and drunk and pissed and threatening to kill people, just like  he does on the street corner.  There you have it.  Robert, what's up?  Hello.  Hey, you're on the radio, Robert.  Hey, how's it going?  All right.  Listen, I just want to tell you, that was sublime yesterday.  It was nothing but sublime humor.  Yeah.  And I don't think you could top it, except if you handed out Saturday night specials 
[00:08:30]  and handed ammo out and told them that it was water guns.  But the thing that I really want to see from here, I mean, it's like a seasonal thing.  This is a seasonal event.  Well, we took last year off, but you're right.  I think this has to happen every year.  I know.  You took last year off, but it went fast.  Yeah.  But the thing is, you have to have a seasonal thing for each season.  I'm thinking for the spring Pejoria Kids baseball.  What I'm thinking about that is that, you know, you guys are syndicated now.  You can go to every city, every town, to get their Pejoria Kids. 
[00:09:00]  You can get a big team together.  Yeah.  And then as a spin-off of that, you can have...  I just don't see the Pejoria Kids working with us.  No, no.  You know what it is?  The homeless are easy.  You're not listening.  He's going on.  Thank you, Robert.  Thank you.  I like Robert, but we've got to cut him off.  People have been talking about Pejoria Kids and having us do things.  They have parents.  Hello.  We're not going to do anything with Pejoria Kids.  They're not going to let us do anything.  Homeless, it's easy.  They've got themselves and nothing else.  There's no one to tell us not to do it.  Homeless, Easter egg hunt, maybe we can do that. 
[00:09:30]  I want to take the homeless bowling, though.  Homeless bowling.  Kind of like take the skinheads bowling.  Let's take the homeless bowling.  That's something I would want to be involved in.  Ooh.  We would do a whole broadcast, though.  Yeah.  We'd go bowling alley.  We'd get teams.  Dude, remember we wanted to take them to Atlantic City?  Now we've got a station in Vegas.  We could take them gambling.  Well, that's our big goal with the homeless.  We want to take them gambling.  Take them gambling.  Swear to God.  Give them all a couple hundred bucks and watch them blow it.  By the way.  Or maybe win some fine cash. 
[00:10:00]  Well, you see them sometimes in there playing the slot machines and stuff.  But with their addictive personalities, I just don't see them walking away with money at all.  Oh, man.  Isn't it great?  That's our ultimate goal, though, to bring them to either Vegas or Atlantic City.  Serious.  And have a huge party and watch the homeless blow money.  By the way, Scott fixed the whole computer.  It's beautiful.  It runs perfectly.  That's why that SNL bit is hilarious.  And as he's walking out, you know, he's just like...  It's like, whatever, dude.  That was easy.  Jesus Christ.  It's right in front of your face.  Jimmy Fallon as computer guy. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  That's why that bit is so great.  Because we all have one of those guys.  It helps us out.  And you do get really embarrassed when he leaves.  It takes you ten seconds.  I know.  You always know it's a bogus email when they address you by your screen name.  They're trying to act like they know you.  Do you ever get one of those?  It's like, hey, Tinkle Drinker, just wanted to see how you are.  It's like, you idiot.  I know that you don't know me.  I get a lot of things about...  A lot of my junk mail consists of how I can make more money than my boss 
[00:11:00]  if I take these classes and get my high school diploma.  That's what I get in my thing.  So I think I'm going to do it.  I want to make more than Ken Stevens.  More than Ken Stevens.  Yeah.  That's a good goal to have.  Of course it is.  I had one come in today and said, I forgot to tell you one more thing.  Yeah.  And I'm thinking, I haven't even had conversations with anyone lately.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, the one that just says, oh, hey, you forgot this.  Right. 
[00:11:30]  Like, what?  Right.  You ever get the one from a chick that goes, I saw you in that chat room the other night.  I wanted to say hi, but I've gotten that a few different...  And you click it and 20 banner ads for some teenage suck sluts page comes up.  I know that it's always...  That's one good thing about having low self-esteem.  You realize when that comes, it's bogus.  It's not for you.  Nobody wants to talk to me.  Not for you.  All right.  Well, we've got to get through these phones.  They're going crazy.  A lot of people checking in about the homeless shopping spree.  John, what's up? 
[00:12:00]  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Next year, you've got to have an award.  You know?  Give them a gold Cadillac.  You know, in homeless terms, of course, that's a shopping cart.  Oh, the shopping cart?  Yeah.  Give them a golden shopping cart.  I don't think Mary Kay gets a Cadillac.  Don't they?  Why cut the homeless?  Yeah.  Well, I think today we're going to have a lot of the homeless guys check in to see how their  night was.  Keith is trying to round some of them up.  Oh, I know.  It's always interesting to see what happened the day after.  I went by one of the corners where Rock and Roll Tommy and Tippy Tom, you know, live, 
[00:12:30]  so to speak, this morning.  Nowhere to be found.  None of the guys where they hang.  They're probably in one of these hotels.  They live in large, man.  They live in large and they're in booty.  Let me tell you something before you continue.  I've got to thank the listeners once again.  We only came up with, I don't know, a hundred bucks for each homeless guy plus like a care  package where it was like warm socks and hats and gloves, you know, that type of stuff.  Mm-hmm.  The listeners were just pulling cash out of their pockets, pulling out their credit cards. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, yeah.  Is it safe to say each homeless guy walked away with at least $500 of stuff?  Easily.  Easily.  Easily.  And cash, yeah.  They were just giving him cash.  Dude, a guy came up to Ziggy and gave him a $50.  I hope he knew what it was.  I'm like, that's a $50.  Oh, God.  That's not a dollar.  My lucky, my lucky $2 bill.  That's Thomas Jefferson.  It's my lucky $2 bill.  Do you have anything smaller?  And he like, he gets his $20 and the dollar and puts it next to each other.  No, they're the same size. 
[00:13:30]  No, you dick.  Smaller.  Okay, Bill.  Denomination.  Okay, Bill.  Oh, Denomination.  But you see it on the video.  You see our listeners just buying them stuff.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, they really came to the table.  That was nice.  All right.  Let's go back to the phones here.  Doug, what's going on?  How you doing, guys?  All right.  When you interviewed Big Blue for the first time yesterday, he sounded exactly like the  time you played a practical joke on Psycho Mark.  We had to come back from Shea Stadium. 
[00:14:00]  Man, you guys are a little weird today.  What's going on?  What's not weird with that?  Are you guys as tired as we are?  Yeah, a little bit.  The first time Spatt has played that trick on Psycho Mark about the bits already?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So he sounded just like who?  He sounded like Psycho Mark.  Oh, like Psycho Mark.  I couldn't understand both of them.  Okay.  Still don't understand.  All right.  That's four calls.  Wow.  All of them stunk.  All of them?  Stunk.  I think everyone's really tired from yesterday's show.  Crazy Paul, the pressure is so on you right now.  Oh, boy.  I don't know if I can do it, but let's see what we can do. 
[00:14:30]  I'll give you my quick observations.  Dumb and Dumber.  Let's go, Crazy Paul.  Nancy, leave me alone.  I can't get these guys off the station.  Dumb and Dumber.  I want to hear some music.  Twinkle Toes.  Tweedle Dumber, Tweedle Dumber.  Tweedle Dumber.  Tweedle Dumber.  Okay.  I'll give you a quick observation.  For all the new cities, this guy absolutely hated us when we first came to New York.  We turned him around.  Despised us.  We have tape of it.  It's awful.  Hate is not the word.  I know.  He'll meme.  Now you won't even leave us alone, man.  I get a message from this guy on my answer machine every day. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, go chase yourself.  So what's up, Paul?  Go chase yourself.  Nothing better than hitting your messages in here.  Ha, ha, ha.  Hey, guys.  It's Quaggy Paul.  I gotta tell you something.  When you're out here today, you're not the guy in the city.  And I can't even hear through the voice what he's saying.  And this guy knows more about our careers than us.  Remember the one that came in?  Oh, I hear you going to Clear Channel.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe it.  Are you going to Clear Channel?  You going to Clear Channel?  Ha, ha.  Okay.  I'll send you a bottle of champagne. 
[00:15:30]  Actually, I'll tell you to drink the bottle that the Clear Channel guy got you.  How he knew that, I still can't even figure it out.  Yeah, Paul, you're scary.  But go ahead.  Well, I'm not going to mention the who's and where's.  That's inside crap.  Anyway.  All right.  Quick observations until I get up to where Norton lost his homeless guy.  Then I'll get to later.  All right.  But Rick gets off the bus.  You thought it was the invasion of Normandy.  Everybody just stormed that mall.  That was beautiful.  Yeah, there were a lot of people.  We saw the videotape.  A huge crowd. 
[00:16:00]  Amazing.  Then, of course, Big Kev splintered off.  Where did he go with his homeless?  For ice cream in the corner.  Ha, ha, ha.  Okay.  And you have a new PR girl there whose voice makes Lisa Orban sound angelic.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh, my God.  I'm the new PR for O.P. and Anthony Shelvin, N.E.W.  Who the hell is that?  Rula Lemska.  Rula Lemska.  Oh, my God.  Rula Lemska reference.  Wow.  Wow.  But she has a southern accent.  Crazy, Paul. 
[00:16:30]  That's southern?  Right?  Are we talking about Ethel?  Yeah.  Maybe.  I don't know which one.  She's from Texas.  Houston.  Houston.  God.  We got it from a real radio station and stuff.  Yeah.  This is our first promotion director that might have a clue.  What a voice.  Exactly.  Not like the ones we've had in the past.  I used to work for a cell phone company.  Yeah, we had a guy that worked for a cell phone company that was going to market the O.P. and Anthony  show in this radio station in New York.  This guy's great.  He'd get you Hummers if you need it.  Right. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, right.  The vehicle.  And then the last guy we had, I forgot his name already.  Dan.  Dan.  Dan the man.  A guy that was the promotion director and didn't want to go to promotions.  What happened to Dan the man?  He's not working here anymore?  No.  I didn't even know.  How long?  Probably about four months.  Really?  I swear I didn't even know.  I didn't know there was no more Dan the man.  We had a guy that didn't want to go to promotions and that was his job to make sure the promotions  ran smoothly.  You know, that is pretty much a testament to that whole situation. 
[00:17:30]  I swear to you, I had no clue that guy wasn't here.  They had a going away party for him and we were the only show that wasn't invited.  No.  Whatever.  Who cares?  We're in Ireland anyway.  Oh my God.  Dan the man's gone.  And he lived in Albany or something.  Yeah, he lived in Albany.  He lived in Albany, which is a good two hour drive.  Two.  Two and a half hour drive.  At least.  From where we're at.  Maybe even closer to three.  God speak Dan the man.  That makes sense when all the promotions are at night. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  He never showed up at anything.  No.  That's why I assumed he was still here.  No.  I never saw him anywhere.  That's like becoming a DJ and actually not doing the job.  So you do afternoon radio in New York, but you don't have to do it.  Uh.  What?  Crazy Paul, so what else you got?  Okay.  Then we got, all of a sudden, like, everybody loved Norton.  They were all saying hello to him.  He's saying hello back to everybody. 
[00:18:30]  By the time he was done, he looked like a deer in the headlights on Thorazine.  He lost his homeless guy.  I really did.  He lost his homeless guy, and he's wandering around.  This really stinks.  I don't want to be here on this bus.  Why did I make me come on the bus?  I didn't want to be on the bus.  I don't want to be here.  I hate everybody here.  This stinks.  Yeah.  We figured that out real quick.  Then it was, where's Keith the cop?  Where's Keith the cop?  I find him, Keith the cop.  He's like, where's my homeless?  Keith is like, how do I know?  You're supposed to be with him.  He lost his homeless. 
[00:19:00]  You know what's funny about that?  The last time we did the homeless shopping spree, if a few of these guys wandered, it wasn't that  big of a deal.  A lot of the guys we got were from shelters and stuff.  Yeah.  These homeless people had problems, and we had to make sure they weren't going to walk  off on their own.  They'd get lost.  Sure.  We had to do a head count and put them on the bus and get them back to where they came  from, because you can't just leave these guys somewhere.  Right.  They're going to hurt themselves or others.  Anything else, Paulie?  Yeah.  Two more quick things.  All right.  Then, of course, I helped him find his homeless people. 
[00:19:30]  Then Voss is wandering around.  He says, I lost my sperm.  I didn't know what the hell he was talking about.  Yeah.  The guy's name that he was with was sperm.  Well, the guy's name was sperm.  Yeah.  I thought he had a medical problem.  No.  He was talking about how sperm wouldn't get off his back.  Yeah.  And then Voss actually said something I never thought I would hear him say.  Yeah.  No.  He just said something funny.  I never thought I'd hear him say.  But anyway, so we find that.  We find him as homeless guys.  Yeah.  Two quick things and I'm out of here.  Ben was like letting people go in the stores, like taking 10 fans in, 20 fans in, and letting 
[00:20:00]  them buy stuff.  What did Voss do?  He must have marched into Macy's with about 714 people and just, oh my God, the horror of  the old people there.  Oh my God, after we're being taken over.  It was incredible.  Anyway.  Find my CD, people.  Find my CD.  There is a video of somebody marching into one of the stores and like you just said,  hundreds of people just following.  Yeah, it looked like a river.  It was wild.  Just going into the store until it filled up.  And of course, Psycho Mark went straight to the bar. 
[00:20:30]  Nobody saw him after.  No.  Yeah, Mark took his two guys to the bar to drink.  And then he was tanked and he goes, now we're going to try to do some shopping.  Shopping.  Shopping.  He's all drunk.  At first, when you get him on the phone, he's like, hey, how you doing?  Psycho Mark here.  I'm here with the homeless guys.  We're going to the bar.  And then after they get to the bar while you check in and he gets that smooth talk on,  he's like, well, we're just hanging out.  Let me tell you, these guys know how to party.  We go, I'm drinking with these guys.  They're like, Mark, what happened to your voice? 
[00:21:00]  Gag, gag, gag.  If you chucked to your junk, you're about to stank or down.  There's one for now.  Anyway, take care, guys.  Anthony, hope I did good for you.  Good job, Crazy Paul.  Great job, Crazy Paul.  Later on, man.  I didn't even know Paulie went down there yesterday.  Let's go to Dan.  Dan, you're next on the OPN.  Hey, guys.  Great show yesterday.  A lot of fun.  Those guys at the mall should be ashamed for not letting the homeless take their picture  with Santa.  Yeah, that was kind of a bummer.  Yeah, Santa ran.  Santa ran away.  They put Santa away somewhere.  We wanted pictures with Ziggy and Santa.  Well, Santa only takes pictures with the beautiful people, I guess. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, maybe that's it.  That's the spirit of Christmas.  Because that's what Christmas is all about.  Fat faggot isn't happy unless there's a kid on his lap.  Just like you.  Yeah, believe me.  I'm not knocking it.  I did have a question for you.  Chris Crinkle Crinkle.  Yeah, Dan, go ahead.  Stand in my bag of toys.  With their confused little feet.  Tripping over little wooden cars.  You guys are effed, man.  You guys are effed. 
[00:22:00]  I love it.  Crinkle Crinkle, always funny, though.  Dan, go ahead.  Yeah, you guys kind of ran out of time at the end there.  I wanted to ask how Ziggy enjoyed his flight back to Manhattan.  The funniest thing yesterday, man, when they were all on the bus.  They're driving over, I guess, which was the East River on one of the bridges.  And Ziggy looked out and he goes, oh, we're on the top of the world.  I was like, what?  He goes, I can't talk.  We're going to land soon.  You know, this is Ziggy who, like you said, has been homeless and in New York City since before 1979. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  I don't think the guy's ever been on a vehicle that has taken him out of this city.  So when he got on the bus, looked out the window as they're driving over a bridge, all he must have thought is, I'm airborne.  I'm flying over the river.  So he thought that they were on some kind of an aircraft.  Flying.  That's the best.  So I guess the hierarchy works.  The bigger ass you really are, the more respect you get. 
[00:23:00]  The more respect you get.  Hell yeah.  All right, Dan.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Look, we're just getting started.  The phones are just lit.  We got to go to them and talk about the homeless shopping spree for a little while.  Okay.  Right.  A lot of observations.  There's pictures up on opianthony.com.  Pictures and video up on foundrymusic.com.  That's f-o-u-n-d-r-y music.com.  That link you could get to through opianthony.com as well.  Okay.  And one thing really fast.  I think we're going to rerun the homeless shopping spree to Christmas Eve.  So tell your friends.  Oh. 
[00:23:30]  Christmas Eve.  We're going to rerun it.  Because we will not be here, right?  No.  Okay.  More of your phone calls next.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Boys.  Looks like we found our boys in the middle of the ocean.  Right, Anthony?  Good news?  Yes.  We found all of them.  That's what they're saying.  B-1 bomber crashed in the Indian Ocean.  And, yeah, three hours later they were plucked out of the E.C. there. 
[00:24:00]  That's good.  That's nice.  Right?  It's American know-how.  Get your plane go down.  You got to get your boys up and out.  Not like those rooskies at that submarine there.  Oh, my gosh.  Everything fine, comrade.  We don't need your help.  Everything okay.  They're down there having a party.  And there they were, dying.  All right, guys. 
[00:24:30]  You know, something happens.  Top priority to get you guys out of there.  God damn, this rocks.  Sorry.  Yeah.  You know, what is with the people trying to titillate us at the New York Post and CNN?  What do you think?  Britney, bear all for animal rights.  They're reporting that Britney Spears is going to do one of those ads for PETA.  People for ethical treatment of animals.  Yuck.  And she'll appear in a nude ad. 
[00:25:00]  You know what that is?  They cover up the vitals.  Right.  She shows more on stage.  And believe me, we've seen the pictures.  They cover up with a banner or something.  Or a snake.  Or a snake.  Or some furry friggin' animal.  God, they're so hip.  Or Justin's head.  Yeah, right.  All right, well.  People for the ethical treatment of fags' sakes, don't do that.  He doesn't like it.  Look how he's trying to get away.  Homeless Shopping Spree 2 was a huge success this day. 
[00:25:30]  We're still recapping.  Rich Voss on the phone.  Voss!  Hey, what's happening?  Sorry to make you wait.  That's okay.  Let me tell you something.  The fans there were great.  It was unbelievable.  One of the coolest things is when the bus pulled in, all the cars were lined up flashing their  lights and stuff.  There's a clip of that on Foundry Music.com.  Yeah.  It was so cool.  They were tailgating.  What's that?  They were shooting for the bus yesterday.  Oh, they were great.  And when we went to Macy's, right, Macy's and Foot Locker were the coolest to us. 
[00:26:00]  Like, the guy who was with Snoop was like a celebrity.  He was like a rapper.  He was standing up on benches and stuff.  We're passing the hat around, which I'm used to, and we're getting all this money and  stuff.  The people were great, right?  Yeah.  And there was tons of people following us.  They circle around Snoop and he's trying on his pants right in the middle of the Macy's.  Not in the aisle.  Yeah.  With the people surrounding him. 
[00:26:30]  He's taking off his clothes and putting on new corduroys.  They don't quite grasp the whole dressing room thing.  No, no.  Changing room.  Fitting room.  And some lady, I think her name was Marion, just bought Snoop boots right out.  Oh, we talked to her earlier.  Yeah.  Buy him some boots.  And she did.  Yeah, she was cool.  Everybody was great.  And then, you're right, when I lost my guy, I was kind of like nervous, because Snoop  was cool.  He kind of had it together.  Well, Snoop is the guy from the first homeless shopping spree.  His life changed because of our stupid little radio bit. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, he kind of got on the ball and decided to do something.  He's got a job and he's been clean.  He still lives on the street a little bit here and there though, right?  Oh, yeah, man.  No, no, no.  Ben's saying no.  He doesn't even live on the street anymore.  Oh, really?  I brought him back because he's one of the originals.  Him and Ziggy were the originals from the first one.  Well, he was great.  He knew how to shop.  He had a nice sweater, nice corduroys.  Yeah.  Let me tell you something, Voss.  Snoop had better clothes on than you, than Norton, than Ben, than Rick, than Steve.  Yeah, he looked good. 
[00:27:30]  He looked good.  Yeah.  But the other guy I was with was kind of like out of his mind.  Kind of.  Sperm, right?  Sperm, yeah.  That's really his name, so.  Really?  Yeah.  And it was kind of scary because there's crowds of people and when you lose them, you know,  it was almost impossible to find them.  Uh-huh.  And, you know, I just kind of gave up on them and ran into them somewhere screaming in the  middle.  Yeah, to them it's just like they might as well be on another planet.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  When they get separated from the group, they're just walking around.  It might as well be Venus.  And one of them bought a cell phone. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, I know.  We were talking about that on the air.  Oh, you were?  It was-  He got approved for a cell phone.  That's good.  One of the homeless guys got approved for a cell phone.  We should have gotten the phone number and called him today.  That's funny.  That's not a bad idea.  Get someone to get it started.  Anyhow, look, I had a great time.  It was a lot of fun.  Cool.  And I'm just getting out of here.  It was a lot of fun, man.  All right.  Those guys were great and all the fans were really, really cool.  They were unbelievable.  You know, hats off to you guys once again.  I mean, because we only came up with maybe $1,000 from the station.  And you guys gave them well more than that. 
[00:28:30]  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Bossy.  Good talk to you later.  All right.  There he goes, Voss.  Voss, Caroline's New Year's Eve.  How about that?  Really?  Yeah, if you want to-  Geez.  What's up, boys?  That says you're going to have a bad year right there.  You're starting it off with Voss at Caroline's New Year's Eve.  No, look at it this way.  It can only get better.  After that, well, okay.  All right.  The optimist.  Well, if you go to watch Voss, you can bring in your New Year's the exact same way people  did in 1979.  I saw him.  Hey, glasses half full. 
[00:29:00]  Not half empty.  Exactly.  Half full.  All right.  Mike, what's going on?  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  We went back to Roosevelt Field today.  Yeah.  And the mall still smells like Jim Norton's breath.  Urine and feet.  Oh, God.  I don't like feet.  Just urine, sir.  It's kind of disgusting.  First of all, yeah, there were some strange boys there.  Blue, I think his name was.  The guy with the snot coming out of his nose the whole night.  Yeah, Blue was probably-  He was on a radio.  He was probably the scariest cat.  Well, the homeless, we found out, like to be entertained. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, but-  So the radios and CD players and whatnot?  Last time I checked, there weren't any outlets on the street.  Yeah, well, they're battery powered, I guess.  That's why a couple of the guys went into the Sharper Image and-  Got lots of batteries.  They were able to buy $50 worth of merchandise, and one guy just bought a handful of batteries.  Yeah.  Yeah, and it was definitely pretty cool, man.  I had a great time.  And it just proves that you guys must have a lot of Jewish followers, too, because-  Did you hear the Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer?  No.  After the first verse, it totally cut off, and I think only the homeless guy knew it. 
[00:30:00]  It was pathetic.  All right.  Yeah, but-  Yeah, Voss was definitely panhandling to buy some new jokes.  He said he got $53.  That's great.  Leave the guy alone.  It's not my fault.  He's terrible.  I mean, look at him.  He looks like-  I don't know, I can't even say.  You should stop that.  Go out on top.  Yeah, go out on top.  Very important to our radio show.  Let's go to Cecilia.  Cecilia, what's up? 
[00:30:30]  Hi, how are you?  All right.  Um, no, I was just calling to tell you guys I had a great time yesterday.  Um, and yeah, the cell phone guy who was actually-  He left his booth to follow us up to Macy's, which I thought was pretty cool.  Yeah.  And, uh, actually I wanted to ask you if I could hear Ziggy sing Silent Night, because I've never heard it before.  Aww.  We're going to get that right on for you, Cecilia.  Oh, thank you.  Because he's a star.  That was from-  He was great.  He was so cute.  Yeah, he's been around for a really long time.  Someone is on the line saying- 
[00:31:00]  I've got to go to him, matter of fact.  Thank you, Cecilia.  We'll get Silent Night on, though.  Anthony.  Yo, what's up, guys?  He was on Ziggy?  Yeah, I was watching this, like, documentary or something about, you know, September 11th and whatnot.  And they kept showing what looked like-  Can't you know what looked like Ziggy?  Yeah?  It was weird. I don't know.  It might have been a homeless thing.  You never know.  That thing was just insane yesterday.  All right?  Like, I don't know who it was, but whoever the guy Rick was with-  Yeah.  He was trying on some clothes, and he blew-  Like, just fell over and blew a snot right into one of his shirts. 
[00:31:30]  Aww.  Yeah.  That's blue.  Blue is scary, man.  It was scary, man.  Oh, and then I was with Rock and Roll Tommy and Psycho Mark the whole time.  Drinking.  Well, Psycho Mark had, like, a nice little Heineken hidden in his jacket.  Like, gah, gah, gah, Heineken!  Ah, that's great.  And, uh...  I'm in the stage of Heineken in my jacket.  You won't believe how many people, like, how many places closed their doors, also.  Yeah, well, they were a little scared.  Oh, they were a little scared. 
[00:32:00]  Well, Victoria's Secret, I can understand, but...  Let's be honest.  What were you going to get from Victoria's Secret for all of us?  Well, you never know.  You never know.  Dude, you want to know what it was?  It was the hot chicks that were in there, and I looked at Ziggy.  I'm like, look at the hot chicks.  And we were going to bring them in, because there were hot chicks that worked there.  And that bitch slammed the door and was like, to me, you can come in, but he can't.  Why would, you know something?  Ziggy doesn't get a chance to see hot chicks that work at Victoria's Secret very often.  Yeah.  Because Christmas is for the beautiful people, Anthony.  I guess it is.  That's what we learned yesterday.  A bunch of elitist white people. 
[00:32:30]  And you know what?  Most of the mall was really cool.  Like, Macy's was phenomenal.  What about Bloomingdale's?  Bloomingdale's was cool, too.  I didn't go in there.  They gave us something back.  Oh, yeah.  We didn't get to go in there, but, you know, they handled it.  Foot Locker was great to us.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Anthony.  All right, bye.  We had a lot of people, and they had an assistant manager or a manager helping, but the listeners  were great, man, because they were like, you know, loud and cheering.  Yeah.  But nobody was ripping stuff off.  Nobody was knocking things over.  Well, that's one thing.  Everything was cool, man. 
[00:33:00]  Everybody was well-behaved.  There was not one problem from yesterday, and there were a lot of people down there.  I would love to know how much money we spent at that mall yesterday.  Yeah.  Between our listeners, the homeless guys.  I heard the mall is a little upset.  Are they upset that they were-  Yeah, they're upset that we just spent thousands upon thousands of dollars at their mall yesterday.  That's ridiculous.  Uh, Anthony, here's Ziggy doing Silent Night.  Oh.  For Cecilia, we found it.  Hold on, people.  Very emotional.  This is from two years ago.  Ziggy, do you know any Christmas songs?  Yeah, I know Christmas songs.  I got all of them.  Yeah?  You want to sing one real fast for us?  I think I can sing it. 
[00:33:30]  All right.  Yeah.  Let's go.  Silent night.  All right.  Holy night.  Always calm.  Always bright.  I didn't have them pegged as an alcove.  Right on yon virgin, mother and child.  Holy infant so tender and mild.  Sleep in heavenly peace.  Sleep in heavenly peace. 
[00:34:00]  All right.  Man.  Let's hear it for Ziggy, huh?  He hit that last note in that song.  Of course he did.  We got to get that CD out there.  I'll be homeless for Christmas.  I'll be homeless for the holidays.  Home for the holidays.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  The thing about Ziggy, like Ben was saying, all the girls love Ziggy.  Ziggy.  And just like that caller said, oh, he was so cute.  What?  Norton.  Hold on. 
[00:34:30]  How often do you get that?  Oh, you're so cute.  Here's a guy that he's been on the streets.  He's a wreck.  But the girls love him.  He's like a little troll.  He's cute.  How often do I get that to answer your question?  Not often.  Yeah.  God damn it.  Hey, Scott, what's up?  Hey, I'm just calling to find out how Typhoid Mary's doing today.  Typhoid Mary.  Yeah.  How is Mary today?  You all right, Mary?  The homeless guys loved you yesterday.  Oh, man.  I recovered.  I took a shower and cut my nails and like I was literally in the shower for about an 
[00:35:00]  hour and a half.  I think everybody was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Keith left me a message on my phone.  He goes, we're back.  Just calling to see how it went.  Right now, I'm going to go to the hospital and get a shot for everything.  Everybody today was asking me if I got shots, if I got like a tetanus shot.  Well, TB I think would be your biggest risk there if you're breathing in a confined space  like a bus.  I feel sick today.  I don't know.  Well, there's a video of one of the homeless guys taking off his sneakers and his socks. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, yeah.  Was that in Foot Locker, Ben?  Yeah, that was Tippi Tom.  Tippi Tom.  Foot action actually it was in.  Took his shoe off.  Foot action.  Now, you see his sock was totally contoured to every wrinkle, every disgusting nook and  cranny of his foot.  You got to wonder the last time he took that sock off.  Yeah.  And then he peels the sock off.  Peels, right.  It's not even taking it off.  It peeled.  You got to peel it off.  And he lumped it up into a ball and then started using the sock to scrub the dirt out from 
[00:36:00]  between his toes.  Wait a minute.  I'm getting nauseous just talking about it.  We can combine two of our bits, the homeless shopping spree and what the hell is that?  Oh.  Homeless, what the hell is that?  Then they gave him brand new socks and brand new snakes to put on, which I guess he was  beaten for and robbed for today.  Yeah.  Hopefully not.  Ant, the only thing you were missing is the smell.  Oh, wow.  Thank God. 
[00:36:30]  Totally disgusted.  Because I had to puke.  It's funny.  I get yelled out if I fart in studio and yet you can stick us on the bus with guys who  have tuberculosis.  Yeah, we just had a whole discussion on farting in the studio.  You're right.  Man, got us there.  Aaron, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Had a great time yesterday.  Cool.  I was hanging out with the boss in Foot Locker and first of all, I got a great picture  of him with the begging hat.  Oh, really?  Wait till I bring it to you guys.  You're going to love it.  Yeah, by the way, you guys can send all your pictures to foundrymusic.com.  Excellent. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, it was great.  We started a collection.  Next thing you know, we got a pair of sneaks for $43 in Foot Locker.  Nice.  It was really cool.  Thank you, bro.  Later, guys.  All right, man.  Anthony, I believe we have a holiday message from our boss, Ken Stevens.  Oh, yeah?  From our boss, Ken Stevens?  Hey, that's nice.  Super GM, Ken Stevens?  Yeah.  Anthony.  And now, a holiday message from Oakley and Anthony Joe General Manager, Ken Stevens.  I don't care no more.  Hey!  My life is over.  I will kill everyone. 
[00:37:30]  I'll take your gun and shoot you in the head and shoot all these motherf*****ers.  And I'll shoot myself.  I guess I'll get up with it.  I'm trying to take a nap.  You know...  I'm trying to take a nap, you know.  Happy holidays from all of us at the Opioid Anthony Joe.  Let it go.  Oh, how nice.  Super GM Ken Stevens with a holiday message for everybody.  A little cranky.  Well, he's had a tough year. 
[00:38:00]  Jeremy, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, Jeremy?  Hey, what's up, man?  You tell us.  Hey, I tell you, you guys are great.  You guys are always breaking the rules, you know what I mean?  That's great, you know?  All right.  I guess right now, it's against the law right now.  Congress said no cloning, but you guys are the biggest clones out there.  That's great, man.  Hey, Jeremy.  It's something new.  You got it.  You're unfunny.  You're unfunny. 
[00:38:30]  See you later, Jeremy.  These guys are so pissed off that we're doing good right now.  Cloning.  Oh, that one.  Where'd he get that from?  If we suck so bad, why are you listening?  He should have thrown a funny little catchphrase in there.  Yeah, and of course, homeless shopping spree has been done a million times.  A million times.  Taking a bunch of homeless people to the mall to horrify the people.  In front of 2,000 of our listeners, of course, yes.  Jeremy, there he is with the strings going up to someone's marionette puppet thing, just 
[00:39:00]  dancing for that guy.  Dancing for someone who wouldn't give you the time of day, Jeremy.  Quoting words like clones.  That's, ooh, cutting edge.  Ooh.  You stayed on the phone.  You held on.  You listened.  Jesse, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, man.  I'm calling from Cleveland.  Ever since you guys got here, man, you're awesome.  Oh, thank you.  I must say, yesterday was some of the funniest radio I've ever heard.  Well, now we have to match that today. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, you guys got to come to Cleveland and do that.  We got a Tower City up here.  Big mall.  No, we'll do something different for Cleveland.  We'll figure something out.  Well, you got a lot of stuff you can do here.  All right.  You can burn the Cuyahoga River again.  Thank you, Jesse.  Yeah.  We appreciate it.  One day, one day when we're able to speak openly and expose hypocrisy and whatnot in this  business, all those little clowns that might have been relevant in 1998, or I mean 1988, 
[00:40:00]  are just going to see for themselves that I wish I could talk openly now.  I really do.  Because they will just, the facts will be laid out there, and unless you're a complete blithering  idiot, you'll go, oh, my God, I've been that big an a-hole for so long.  If it's a little vague, it's as specific as I can get without being dumped out of.  All right.  But it's all there.  All right.  Ass. 
[00:40:30]  Can't even speak openly.  Is Ken calling up now to yell?  No.  No?  He's not calling up yet?  No.  Saying, please don't talk about it or I'll be fired?  No.  Ken actually went into a nice battle for us today.  It was very sweet.  Oh, great.  Like the Taliban battling the alliance in the United States.  I'm sure it'll be that successful.  Jackass.  Let them hang. 
[00:41:00]  Let them hang like the animals they are.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show today.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-2774.  Wow.  By the way, coming in today, Mario Cantone. 
[00:41:30]  Very funny guy.  Mario.  Rock.  Oh, man.  We're getting a lot of requests for this bit.  I just got to play it real fast?  Yeah.  Do you mind?  It's only a minute.  Hi, this is Bill, and I feel your pain.  That's why I'd like to tell the American people about a way to reduce the stress in your life  and help put a smile on your lips. 
[00:42:00]  Introducing my all-new Big Willie Pop.  Suck on a Big Willie Pop, and you'll see why women everywhere just can't stop.  Made with all natural ingredients, my Big Willie Pop has a cream center that is a great source of protein.  And, moms, you'll be happy to know that once you unzip my package,  your kids can suck on my Big Willie Pop all day.  Hey, what do you have in your mouth?  Nothing.  Come on, you can tell me.  What are you sucking on? 
[00:42:30]  Okay, don't tell anyone.  It's a Big Willie Pop.  Wow.  Can I taste?  Yeah.  Here, wrap your lips around this.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Hey.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Get that back.  Mmm.  Get that back.  It's a sucking oil.  Oh, no.  Mmm.  So listen and listen good, because I'm only going to say this once.  Satisfy your craving and put my Big Willie Pop in your mouth.  Excuse me?  Can I have one?  Sure, Chelsea. 
[00:43:00]  Come here.  Very strange.  We're getting a lot of requests for that bit today, Anthony.  Yeah, I wonder why.  Clinton's not even in the news, but people want to hear that today.  Yeah, I don't know why.  It's Rick's bit.  Yeah.  Written many years ago with his wife doing the voice there.  Yeah, isn't that good?  It's so good.  Other radio shows enjoy playing that.  Hmm.  I wonder why they would play that if...  That's Rick's bit.  Rick's wife's on it.  Yeah.  That's Linda. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  That's one of the hottest voices in the business.  That's interesting.  Yeah.  Well, wow.  She even did the pop by herself.  She did the pop.  Yeah.  And she pulled it out of her mouth.  That's it.  I guess we should be flattered, right?  Oh, yeah.  Other stations playing that bit, sure.  Yeah.  All right.  Darren, what's going on?  Yeah, I was just calling in to say exactly that.  I guess I missed it.  But yeah, I heard that on another show this morning.  Oh, get out of here, really? 
[00:44:00]  That's pretty strange.  All right.  I was kind of surprised when I heard it because I've heard it before.  Oh, yeah.  It's a little bit that Rick wrote and produced and his wife's on it.  But all right.  That's interesting.  I wonder why another show would play that.  Hmm.  Is it the same show that used to play tracks from our Dementor World CD before we came  to New York?  Maybe.  Possibly.  Sure.  But who are we to say, you know?  But why would they play it if sometimes, you know, you hear about people taking stuff from  other shows?  It doesn't make sense. 
[00:44:30]  I don't know.  It's almost hypocritical.  Sure.  Hmm.  That's odd.  Wow.  That's so strange.  Very strange that people want to hear that today.  Adam, what's going on?  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  This is Adam from Jersey.  Wait.  Who's in the studio right now?  Everybody.  Everybody?  All right.  Well, first off, I got to get some...  Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I'm sorry, guys.  I think we're going to have a problem with this guy.  Okay.  Yeah.  Why are you cursing, sir?  Yeah.  Whatever.  All right.  What's up?  Well, here's what I got to say, guys, and it's really from the heart. 
[00:45:00]  I've been listening to you guys for a year and a half.  You guys kick ass.  You've helped me through some hard times.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  First time, long time.  Ha, ha, ha.  What do you mean by hard times?  I don't know.  Just like some bad depression and whatnot.  Why are you depressed?  I don't know.  Retarded.  Well, why are you depressed?  What's wrong with your life?  I don't know.  I just, like, got bad mood swings and all that mess. 
[00:45:30]  Maybe he's bipolar.  Yeah, actually, that's what it is, Ant.  All right.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  Well, anyway, I'll do my best not to suck, but here's some things I got to say today.  First off, props to Keith.  He did a great job of making sure the homeless didn't whatever.  Hey, dude.  You got an IAM.  Oh, my bad.  All right.  And I'll say, yo, on the WNEW site, the first pick you got for the homeless shopping spree  is, like, a pick of an effing Jawa, man.  See, Opie, I predicted correctly that we were going to have a problem with him. 
[00:46:00]  I could tell right from the beginning of that call.  Man, what's up with the listeners today?  Not giving us anything.  Hello?  Hi, Marianne.  What's up?  Oh, hey.  I just wanted to say I loved your homeless show yesterday, and you guys are just the best,  and you show a lot of good Christmas spirit and everything, and that's what it's all about,  making people happy.  Yeah, that's what it was all about.  And one person special, you make my husband happy every night on the way home because he  listens to you guys, and he says that you keep him awake and keep him laughing all the 
[00:46:30]  way home.  We live up in Sussex.  It's like up in North Jersey, and he has a long ride in from down below, so you guys  are just the best.  I just wanted to tell you that.  Hello.  Uh-oh.  Am I still on?  Oh, boy.  No.  You cut me off.  No, no.  All right.  Thank you, Marianne.  It wasn't a bad call.  It was a good call.  All right.  No, it was a great call.  Sure.  Okay.  All right.  Bye-bye.  I enjoy it.  You know who she sounds like?  Al Pacino's wife in Dog Day Afternoon. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, God.  Is he going to shoot me, dump my body in the river?  All right.  So there you have it with the homeless shopping spree, Anthony.  Yeah.  It's done.  We had a great time.  It was great.  It was a lot of fun.  Hundreds of pictures up on the websites and video clips, so check them out for yourself  to see what you heard yesterday, okay?  AOPAnthony.com and FoundryMusic.com.  We got three bus clips?  Yeah, we got three clips from the bus on the way in.  Oh, this wasn't heard on the air yet?  Yep.  Oh, all right.  Why don't we play some of this?  I forgot they had audio on the bus, Anthony. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, and it was kind of hard to listen to yesterday with all the cursing.  Right.  I'm just making sure it's A and not B, Anthony.  Oh, it's A and not B?  I think it's A today and not B.  All right.  Let's find out.  This is a clip of Blue freaking out on the bus on the way to the mall.  All right.  Be nice.  What's up, Blue?  Where?  Yeah, it's a rat.  Relax.  It's a rat.  I'm going to kill you, man.  Wait until we get back to 14.  I'm going to kill you.  Just relax.  Calm down, man. 
[00:48:00]  I'm going to kill you.  All right.  Kill you until we get back to 14.  Kill you.  When we get back to 14, you can do whatever the f*** you want.  I'm going to do it in his studio.  He did it on the bus when I tried to be all right.  Relax.  You got me?  You got me?  Relax.  Everything's going to be good.  We're going to go shopping.  You can buy a f***ing hammer and then you can hit him in the head.  Mark, stop it.  I don't want to do nothing.  Relax. 
[00:48:30]  I don't want to do nothing, sir.  He's starting trouble.  There's no one starting anymore.  We got the $100 in his head.  F*** the $100.  I'm going to kill him.  Let me out with this bus.  Let me out with this bus.  And I swear to my mother.  I swear to my f***ing mother.  I'm going to kill him.  I'm going to hurt him.  I'm going to hurt him.  My man, the bus driver, he's cool.  Let me off.  Right here. 
[00:49:00]  Hold on.  Just relax.  Right here.  Right here.  Let me off.  Relax.  Calm down.  Let me off.  Just tell him I'm going to take him.  Blue.  Blue.  Let me off.  Let me off.  Let me off.  I'm tired as s***.  I said I'm tired as s***.  Let me hear me.  Let me hear me, yo, blood.  I know blue.  You're on my ass.  I'm tired as s*** you, man.  Jake. 
[00:49:30]  Let me go.  Wow.  He wanted it off.  That's when the bus just started, right?  The trip.  I think we were, you know what it was?  We were right near the Queens Correctional Facility.  Oh, he thought he was going.  And he thought he was going there.  And he started to wig out.  He saw all the barbed wire and stuff.  Right.  And who was he fighting with?  Um, I don't know, because it just started out of nowhere.  Then Mark ran back there and he started to calm him down.  And he started to get the bar.  The hammer.  Hey.  You know what's funny, too?  When we went by one of the stores on 57th down by Nike Town, they have like ten clocks 
[00:50:00]  of the time all over the world going.  And we went by and he goes, damn, it's 9.30?  That one didn't even make the air.  In England.  Psycho Mark, what's up?  What a sick mother effer he was.  Yeah.  He was priceless.  If my phone breaks up, I apologize.  I'm not a crowd zero.  But yeah, he was completely out of his mind.  Yeah.  What do you have to add to that?  Nothing.  He should have bought the hammer and killed him on the goddamn bus when we got back.  Mark, what happened to your voice, by the way? 
[00:50:30]  Uh, it's, uh, I went to the Fox party Friday.  Yeah.  And I went to a wedding in Boston Saturday.  Were you hanging out with Bill O'Reilly?  I was, I was hanging out with Uncle Bill doing scotches.  I'm not.  No, and then I just, I don't know, I got laryngitis.  And then I had to do the shopping spree yesterday, which totally...  You didn't have to do it with the shopping spree yesterday.  You, you went to the bar and drank.  Oh, I know.  Well, I, I did whatever the boys wanted to do.  You put the two drunks out of the game.  That has nothing to do with the air quality down at, uh, Ground Zero, your voice? 
[00:51:00]  Uh, it had a little bit to do with it, as a matter of fact.  I got a little bit of a problem with my lungs.  When are you taping the O'Reilly factor?  I was supposed to be on last night, believe it or not.  But you know what?  I gave him up for you guys.  You're right.  You're right there.  Knowing you, you're...  All right.  I swear to God, I was supposed to be on last freaking night.  You're not a liar.  I'm not a liar, you dick.  Bill O'Reilly, I'd like to bring out this tool, Psycho Mark.  But he's in a mall right now with homeless people. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, I'm doing better things.  At least he's not copying other people's bits, you know?  What are you doing down there today?  I'm just actually watching the boys recover bits and pieces down here.  They were just cutting down part of the North Tower.  So it's just, you know, real happy stuff.  Yeah, all right.  Anyhow, no, it's funny stuff.  He's down there lounging around.  I can't get through the goddamn tunnel.  Yeah, no kidding.  Well, what a sick nigga he was yesterday, huh?  What are you talking about? 
[00:52:00]  What are you crazy?  He was.  He's totally blue.  He's totally back.  I bet you he's dead on the street today.  And that's just quite a bust.  He's lost all his crap.  I think he meant it with love, with an A at the end.  Yeah, Mark.  I don't think the alone.  Mark, the over-under is that you will join Homeless Shopping Spree 10.  He got that right.  As a shopper.  That's right.  Sign me up.  All right.  Thank you, Mark.  See you later.  Bye.  There he goes.  You can tell he's sober.  You can tell he doesn't have that voice on there. 
[00:52:30]  Paul, what's up?  Hey, Paul.  What's up, man?  Transit cop Paul, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Listen, I saw your buddy Tippi Tom today.  Tippi Tom?  Tippi Tom.  Yeah.  He's a buddy of mine.  Yeah.  He's not too happy with you guys.  Why?  First of all...  He's not a happy person in general.  You guys are miserable.  Tippi Tom's got some problems.  Yeah.  No.  A lot of the stuff that he bought at the mall yesterday, he already got it stocked with,  if you can believe it, except for his blue boots. 
[00:53:00]  He shot off his blue boots, but he said he fell asleep, then he woke up, and I don't  know, they all picked off all the stuff that he had bought already.  Oh, God.  I'm sure he still has the cash, though, the listeners gave him.  Because they were hiding that cash.  They know how to hide cash.  Let me tell you, he's also got a bonus with you guys.  He's claiming that you guys didn't give him the $100, and he's coming down there tomorrow.  Remember, he was also claiming we didn't give him the $20 the other day, which we gave  him.  See, the thing is, he gets so drunk, he forgets.  He does. 
[00:53:30]  Well, you know, I've run into that knucklehead about a few times, and he's always so drunk,  he never remembers me, but your buddy Blue, he's another, he's a classic.  Yeah.  I don't know how many times I wanted to split his skull open, but he's just so defenseless.  It's, you know.  All right, Paul.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  Let's move on to Pete.  Pete, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yo, yo, open in.  Hey, what's up?  Listen, there's Pete from the Bronx. 
[00:54:00]  I've been listening to you guys since about the Spazz with the Tomato thing.  All right.  I never heard you play the big willy pop.  That is unbelievable, and I've been hearing that for years, if you know what I mean.  Oh, it's a good bit.  Yeah.  It's a great bit.  It's a great bit.  Clint's really not in the news anymore, so we don't really play it much.  Yeah.  Yeah, but I can't believe this other guy still plays it, and, you know, everybody thinks  it's him.  Yeah.  Well, there you go.  Thank you, Pete.  Take it easy, fellas.  Just one of many examples. 
[00:54:30]  There you go.  Rick, we got another clip?  Yeah.  Rock and roll Tommy.  Rock and roll Tommy about ripping off phones.  This is how he makes his money as he lives on the street.  Oh.  Rock and roll Tommy.  On the bus, on the way to the mall.  How much money can you make in a good day?  You work all day?  Yeah.  Like a hundred bucks?  A hundred bucks a day?  Yeah.  Panhandling?  I used to do telephones, man.  Yeah.  I spent too much time in Rikers Island.  I spent just about all the last year in Rikers Island.  For what? 
[00:55:00]  Stuff with a telephone, when you don't get your quarterback, if it's busy or there's no answer.  Uh-huh.  When you don't get your quarterback, that's me.  What do you do?  We've got to stuff something up the coin return.  Uh-huh.  And then we're waiting.  The car, there's no answer.  We're in business.  Yeah.  That quarter falls down in whatever you're talking with.  How much money can you make to a man?  How many phones, though? 
[00:55:30]  I have my own rounds.  Really?  Like 20 phones, 30 phones, that kind of thing?  He used to buy CDs.  He had a route.  He had a telephone route.  That's old school, though.  I've heard that a while ago.  You take like a rag or something, shove it up in there, and then the coin would drop, but  you wouldn't be able to get it.  No one cares about the quarter. 
[00:56:00]  You're not going to go digging because it's disgusting.  And then they go in with like a hooked hanger, pull that rag out of there, and then all the  money would come flying down like a slot machine, hitting a jackpot.  Yeah.  You know what?  I haven't gotten a quarterback from the phones, and that really annoys me.  Because that was probably somebody stealing your money.  Maybe next year we should have a contest where you buy the homeless clothes, and you give  the listeners bats, and you're trying to smash the homeless.  Give them that hope that they're going to be able to go back to their box with the stuff  and then just pound them with bats. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  Just take it.  Hey, Rick.  Do you think we have a final clip before we finally move on?  Yeah.  It's just of the, I guess it's the thing one, right, Steve?  Yeah.  It's the Christmas carols.  Christmas carols from the Hortles.  Mm-hmm.  Christmas carols from the Hortles.  Yeah.  It's the season to be jolly.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Good job.  Good job. 
[00:57:00]  We don't want to be a winner.  We don't want to be a winner.  Please, please.  Just one.  All right.  There you have it.  Kind of the wrap-up from yesterday's show.  Yeah.  So if you want to see the video clips and the pictures, go to opieandantony.com or foundrymusic.com.  Or if your phone call's next.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:57:30]  I find the most erotic part of a woman is the boobies.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Mario Cantone on his way in.  Should be here within the next half hour, Anthony.  What are they?  We love Mario Cantone.  Full of energy.  I mean, I like girls, but I love Mario Cantone.  It's a comedy of Mario Cantone. 
[00:58:00]  Right.  Norton in the studio.  Got to move on to other things finally here.  Yeah.  All right.  I just got a good little feeling.  Huh?  I'm reading this.  It's in the Daily News.  I just looked at this.  The title is, She Faces Eviction at 90.  One of these stories.  She's 90 years old, and she's on, like, a breathing apparatus and stuff.  Yeah, a little respirator. 
[00:58:30]  And she's been paying $440 a month for a two-bedroom flat.  Wow.  And this guy wants to raise the $1,400, and he's trying to get her boated.  And I just love him.  Can't he just...  You respect that man?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can't he just wait, though?  Why?  It's just a matter of time.  Just get her out.  You know what'll happen?  She'll drop dead, but before that, she'll give it to someone else, and it's rent-controlled.  I think if you have a piece of merchandise that you could sell for a certain price, what should stop you?  Exactly.  It's yours. 
[00:59:00]  It's yours.  Why should you be stopped?  Put her in a dumpster somewhere.  You're happy that the guy's going to kick her out?  Yeah, man.  $1,400 a month is actually a good price for a two-bedroom.  Because of her age?  Yeah.  You have to get the old person's smell out of there, but otherwise...  Grandma powder smell.  Yeah.  Great place to hang out.  Probably smells better than your place, though.  Your current place.  True.  Well, I don't know.  There's probably an equal distribution of tinkle in both apartments. 
[00:59:30]  Keith the cop.  What's going on, gentlemen?  I'm a little late checking in.  Yeah, you have perfect timing.  We finally want to move on, and you're calling us.  What's going on, man?  Nothing.  Somebody saw some of these guys today, because I've been around for the last few hours,  and I haven't seen any of them.  And usually you see them every day, right?  Yeah, I try to keep an eye on them every day.  Right.  Yeah, Keith kind of is like the little, I don't know, he watches out for these guys, sort of.  Yeah.  Yeah, they...  What are the odds that they're in a hotel today?  I don't know.  When I left the studio last night, supposedly Rock and Roll Tommy and Tippy Tom got in a cab 
[01:00:00]  and took off the cab.  Where the hell were they going?  I don't know.  Big Ed was standing there, and I said, where did those guys go?  He goes, they jumped in a cab and left.  I said, so I don't know where.  Maybe they went to AC or something.  Who knows?  Oh, my God.  Imagine that.  Big players.  Don't you need a credit card to stay in a hotel?  I thought you needed a credit card to get a cell phone, too, but obviously you didn't  need that.  Yeah, I know.  Somehow one of the homeless guys got a cell phone.  I said, how are you going to pay for that?  He says, well, he collects $12.50 a day in cans. 
[01:00:30]  Well, Keith, everyone's wondering what happened to the guys, so let us know when you find  out, okay?  I'll check in if I find some of them.  We're hoping that not all their stuff was stolen and ripped off.  I'm sure there's a strong possibility some of it's gone, but I'll check in with you guys  later.  All right, Keith, thank you.  Talk to you later.  No problem.  All right.  There's Keith the cop who did a great job for us yesterday.  Peter, what's up?  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  All right, man.  Cool.  I heard something.  I said, Anthony, I think you're going to like this.  You know that dude, the American guy that turned Taliban to traitor?  John Walker. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  John Walker.  They're keeping him in like a can, like a metal box, because people are going to take  shots at him.  Have you seen it?  Yeah, the shipping crate.  Yeah, it's a shipping container.  It's one of those big containers you see on the back of trucks or on a ship.  They have it plopped down in their little base, and they keep this guy in it.  Now, it isn't a modified crate with windows or air conditioning and stuff like that.  This is just a shipping crate that they threw this guy in and shut the door.  And they're guarding it. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, they have barbed wire around it and guards.  And the unfortunate thing is, I'm sure this bastard is loving this.  Oh, God.  I'm sure he loves the attention.  And now his latest thing is, here's America protecting him.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Protecting him.  His latest thing now, under interrogation, he's been saying that, yeah, they're going  to do something after Ramadan.  You know, in a couple of more days after this Sunday, Ramadan's over.  So there's going to be some kind of bio attack on the United States. 
[01:02:00]  Ramadan, Ramadan, Ramadan.  This guy is loving that he has the power now to shake us up a little bit.  And he's going on.  He's telling these guys things.  He's a low-level piece of crap that, what do you think, they're going to let him in on  that info?  He's not even one of theirs.  He's a crusty American, as far as they're concerned.  But he's getting so off on scaring us, because that's what he does.  He's a terrorist.  He's a little bastard.  He's a little bratty white kid.  And they said on his internet posts, he used to pretend he was a black man, and he was 
[01:02:30]  gangsta-wrapped, like, slang.  Just like a typical suburban douche.  Wigger.  White kid.  No, I didn't even think he was that.  I think he was just anything to show Daddy that I'm on my own.  And I just hope that he's killed by the...  Swallow mule juice, if you want to show Daddy you're different.  Yeah, exactly.  What do you think we're going to do to this guy, though?  Hopefully we'll gas him.  You know what?  He'll be brought back.  We will not gas this guy.  Let me tell you something.  I've already heard enough, reading news groups and other websites, from people, especially 
[01:03:00]  girls, going, I felt bad when they let him around tied by the elbows, or, you know, he looked  cute without the beard.  If he shaved, it's these stupid twats.  What do you expect?  Of course.  You're absolutely right.  What do you expect?  These stupid bitches.  Of course you do.  It's the bitches that are bitches.  What did Mary say?  Mary thinks you should be gas.  I think she should be gas.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, look who Mary hangs out with on a daily basis, the likes of this show.  At least we have a president that's not scared to kill somebody, so. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, I know.  He sent more people to the electric chair of the gas chamber than many people.  Well, you know, I just hate when chicks think somebody's, oh, he's a real cutie.  It's like if you make fun of retarded people, it's like, oh, that's not really nice.  And then you ask them, well, would you drink out of a retarded guy who's been old?  They're like, oh, no, no.  You know.  They get all sensitive about that.  You know, Clinton was really cute, too.  You know, so don't be mean to all your bad Republicans.  This guy has to be brought back here and killed and killed. 
[01:04:00]  You could set up some trial, some tribunal, whatever they want to do.  I don't care because, you know something, especially if it's a military tribunal,  the guy will just be found in some high treason and put to death.  It ain't going to happen.  But you know something?  It ain't going to happen.  Right.  The goddamn lawyers step in and everything.  A Marine should open that box up and plant one right in his head and drag him out and  make sure there's pictures and video of it so we can all enjoy it here at home. 
[01:04:30]  Because this guy's a hump.  Put him in a firehouse somewhere here in Manhattan and give the firemen 20 minutes along with  a whole room.  There you go.  That's a good one.  Go to one of the firehouses that lost the most guys.  And then they walk out and go, I don't know what happened.  I don't know what happened.  I don't know what happened.  Fall down the pole.  Yeah.  We were showing him the fire truck, you know, like we show the kids.  We showed him around and all of a sudden he fell.  I don't know.  How did his head get under the wheel of the truck?  I don't know.  We were watching him and that happened.  There we go.  Hey, scumbag.  Little scumbag.  Brad, what's going on? 
[01:05:00]  You're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  How's it going, guys?  All right.  Haven't heard from you in a while there.  Well, we're here.  I've been kind of busy up here in Canada.  And hey, there's that problem with that guy down there, man.  I tell you what, when they get him back, we'll load him full of Molson product and bring him down to the frigging ground zero there and drop a crane on his head.  Well, that's another good way.  We pretty much just said that, but in another way.  But thank you.  I tell you.  Thanks, Brad.  He would get on these websites and chat rooms years ago and he would talk about black causes and talk about it in the first person. 
[01:05:30]  Be like, you know, I've had to struggle being a black man in this country.  They have these messages that he sent.  And he would talk about how he is an oppressed black man and how him and his people should do something about it.  Meanwhile, he was a suburban little white son of a bitch who then decided, unfortunately, when he met up with the Taliban, they didn't just kill him right there and just gang rape him. 
[01:06:00]  Now, for some reason, they took him in and this is what we get.  Now, now, you know, I don't know how much it's costing, probably not that much, but we're paying for people to take care of him.  Craig.  That's right.  This is never good.  I'm in Niagara Falls.  Craig, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  He's going over the falls in a barrel, man.  I think he's going to make it, though.  Craig, what's up?  The reason that Walker's not going to be convicted of treason and henceforth put this up is the stipulations are really specific because it was abused over in England a lot. 
[01:06:30]  Because the stipulations are it has to be two people testifying against you that you committed an overt act of war against your country or a confession in open court.  Neither one of those things are ever going to happen.  So it's going to be a bunch of lesser charges.  Well, how does that happen when he was found armed with people and fighting our soldiers? 
[01:07:00]  How is that not treason?  I didn't write the law, but international law and U.S. stipulation for being found guilty of treason is you have to have two people testify against you or you have to confess.  All right.  How about two people testifying against you?  How about the people that were shooting at him and that he was shooting?  They should have been better shots as far as I'm concerned.  Obviously, this guy's life is going to suck from here on in. 
[01:07:30]  You know, not a lot of job prospects for this loser.  But he's definitely not going to be tried for treason and he's definitely not going to be executed.  Craig, you don't get it.  He's going to be a media darling.  Right.  This is a guy.  Oh, imagine the talk shows that want this guy.  You think you don't think Barbara Walters, that all will sit down with him.  He'll write a book is going to be clamoring to get this.  And that's why I hate that bitch.  I want to use the C word so bad.  Barbara Walters, Ron Jeremy, who's given people so many years of great pornographic entertainment.  And she has to speak out how she is disgusted this man is even on our show. 
[01:08:00]  She was dead set against it.  But the other little whores on The View talked her into having him on.  Gene Simmons, another example.  Well, I was disgusted that Gene Simmons was on our show.  So I can relate to that.  I can relate to that, too, because she didn't want to be bored to death, maybe.  But do you think if this guy was offered up to make the circuit and it came down to all the hosts bidding or whatever they do, 
[01:08:30]  like they did with Monica, to get this guy, do you think she would be at the front of the line wanting to interview this guy?  Absolutely.  She would want him sitting there asking, what happened with your parents?  And why is it that you went to the Taliban?  Taliban, you know damn well, yet she's got a problem with Ron Jeremy because he likes to put his mule places.  She is a disgraceful, stroke-mouthed, ugh, twat. 
[01:09:00]  Thank you.  Paul Mooney, you ever see Paul Mooney, a great black comic, who absolutely...  We had problems with Paul Mooney.  You don't like white people.  I don't care.  You don't like white radio guys.  And he hates Barbara Walters.  Yeah.  Oh, he's a dirty bitch.  Oh, he's the greatest.  But it's not just her.  It's all the rest of them.  I enjoy a good hypocrite, though, Anthony.  You like that?  Yeah, me too.  I enjoy a good hypocrite.  Oh, she would sit down there in a second and just be a hypocrite.  I'm not saying that John Walker's not cute.  I mean, you know, if you're just a man looking at him, you go, wow, he's a smooth lad.  There's nothing wrong with that. 
[01:09:30]  Smooth lad.  It looks good with the Jim Morrison look.  Yeah, it is.  It's the Jim Morrison running through the desert eating peyote look.  We're the late, late Beatles.  John, what's up?  The very late Beatles, yes.  Hey, John.  Hey.  What's going on?  You tell us.  You guys want to punish Walker?  Yeah.  Give him front row seats, lifetime to Voss's shows.  Oh, my God, sir.  Now you're being too cruel.  Come on.  How can you make fun of Voss today?  He helped us out yesterday with a homeless shopping spray.  That's still a good way to do it. 
[01:10:00]  You guys are good.  Norton rules.  You guys are cruel.  You've got to leave Voss alone today.  He did a good thing yesterday.  And people are saying they should put him in prison because the people will kill him in there.  They will not put him in general population.  No, no, no.  It's the same thing as that.  What do you think?  McVeigh sat around in general population.  No one decided to gnaw his head off?  Oh, because we've got to make sure we protect them.  For some ridiculous reason, we have to protect the most animalistic people in this country. 
[01:10:30]  Or even now out of this country.  I say people like Walker, you put them all together in a prison, let them figure it all out.  Oh, like escape from New York or something.  And where's the mafia when you need them?  Juliani put a stop to the mafia.  Well, no, guys.  The ACLU is right.  They have to have the liberties.  They need their rights.  They need more rights than you have.  Syllable liberties?  What?  Can I ask a question off the subject?  Yeah, go.  The guy that was killing birds, so you know I've spoken about him.  I love him because he was killing pigeons. 
[01:11:00]  Did they ever catch him?  What, killing pigeons around New York?  Oh, he's a classic, this guy.  Whoever, if you're listening, sir.  Oh, is it the guy that would just stomp on them in front of tourists?  Oh, you saw the pigeon outside the building?  Is that why you bring this up?  No, no, no.  It's because I went out to my...  Because there's one, there was one on 56th and 7th just laying there half dead.  Really?  I didn't know what the...  I needed a shovel to put it out of its misery.  It wasn't coming back to life, this one.  But go ahead, sorry.  No, it's okay.  I asked because this is true.  I woke up this morning and there were 40 dumps on my brand new stylish chicken Saturn. 
[01:11:30]  And I just wanted the guy that was killing those birds to know I'm behind you 100%.  If you're still poisoning them, I'm right behind you.  God bless you.  There was a guy that used to walk around with the big boots on, big combat boots.  And, you know, tourists would be walking around, and especially if they're feeding the pigeons,  he would, like, walk up and then slowly run and punt one of these pigeons right in front of the tourists.  And all you'd see are feathers flying. 
[01:12:00]  It would explode in blood and feathers.  How do I know that?  Did we have the guy on the show or something?  We read about it a while back.  We had some wacko on the show, and that's what he would do in his spare time.  The horror of the tourists feeding these pigeons as he just punted in it.  Steel-toed boot, and the thing would just explode.  Army boot.  Oh, it's great.  Hey, Kevin, what's up?  You're next on the O&A show.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  You guys hear about James Fonda?  What now?  If, what's this, John Walker kid comes back to the United States, she's going to hire Ethel Bailey to defend him. 
[01:12:30]  And this was in the Post, like, two days ago.  No way is this true.  Yeah, I know.  She also said that not only would the kid get off, but they'd build a statue for him.  She should be put in one of those containers, too, for what she has done.  She should drop dead.  She is, yeah, she better just shut up.  She's just starting to get out of the, uh, get out of her crap that she pulled in Vietnam.  That was some pretty strong language there.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Thank you, Jim.  She better shut up.  She better just shut up now. 
[01:13:00]  Rev.  You.  Sitting on her anti-aircraft gun with the North Vietnamese slopes.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Did you catch Mariah Carey on Letterman last night?  Uh, no.  Oh, I missed this.  People have been emailing me.  You went to Harborfield, right?  I hope he did.  I did.  I hope he did.  All right.  My brothers know her pretty well.  She's on Letterman, you know, talking about singing for the troops and her new concert.  I think she's trying to rebuild her career. 
[01:13:30]  First of all, she comes out from the other door on the right side, like she doesn't want  to hang out in the green room with anybody else.  She bends over his desk to give him a kiss hello.  Yeah.  Her butt was huge.  I'm talking huge.  Nice.  She comes out that way because she only wants to be filmed from one side.  Well, it was her back side.  That's the truth.  Yeah.  But she sits down.  She's wearing a tight dress that kind of is riding up a little.  She spent the entire interview taking her hand, trying to cover her upper, where she 
[01:14:00]  sat in the pile of gravel, if you know what I mean.  Oh, she's got a little of the cellulite happening.  It was distracting.  Like, you couldn't, because of the armrest on the chair, she couldn't really get a good  angle that looked comfortable.  So she looked very uncomfortable.  At one point, her hand moved up a little, and she took her middle finger and slid it  back down her side to find, like, the divot.  She's got those problems, man.  And you couldn't even listen to what she was saying.  She's huge.  She twists herself up in the chair.  I know what this guy's talking about because I've seen her do it before.  I didn't see it last night.  But she will sit down in a very skimpy outfit and then try to cover herself up by bending 
[01:14:30]  herself into a pretzel.  She was, her arm was, now, just hold your arm at a right angle and bend your wrist so  your pinky is going all the way to the ground.  No.  That's hard to hold that for about this.  Wear a different outfit.  Ow, it hurts already.  Wear a different outfit or something, you know, or sit in a different angle.  And the cameraman seemed to be focusing.  Like, they would not, they showed a close one on her face maybe twice.  The rest of the angle was strictly like, look at her fat side. 
[01:15:00]  She's trying to stay sexy.  She's losing her effing mind because you see Britney and Christina Aguilera and Shakira  and Jessica Simpson all looking hot and sexy.  And she knows she's getting older and she's losing it in that department.  And she's getting a little chubbier in the face.  And I swear to God, she's getting a simian look to her.  Well, she's holding the hair down.  That monkey mouth, that chimp mouth is going.  Yeah, she had the hair down around her face to make her face look a little small.  But when she smiled, like you said, it was kind of like an orangutan. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, yeah.  She was defending herself on the, you know, the hospital thing.  Like, Dave's like, so what's going on?  She's like, well, let me just say, you know, I've always been a workaholic.  And some people work too many hours.  Sometimes you just have to say, stop.  And Dave's looking at her saying, yeah, you know, I understand.  I'm thinking, you're so, you know, your career is over.  You're going to be singing at, what, the Super Bowl now?  The National Anthem?  She had a fine little career, though, there.  It was nice, you know.  Yeah.  She had a good run.  It's over.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  Take care, guys.  Have a great day.  Bye.  I think she's sexier now, though, man, that she's got, like, I don't like them fat. 
[01:16:00]  Fat women really should be gutted.  But I like a woman with a little bit of a thick thighs and a little chubby ass and a little  definitely a mental problem.  Yeah.  And the mental problems, of course.  And a nice, meaty pouch.  No, you know what I'm saying.  I like it to look like a catcher's mitt.  No, I love that.  You just shove a baseball in there and put her under the mattress.  Hot pocket.  Hey, speaking of fat women, you know, I've been playing that Grand Theft Auto 3, Anthony. 
[01:16:30]  Of course.  And when you're tooling around in these cars, doing these missions and just having a blast.  My favorite video game of all time, by the way.  Very good.  I love the violence.  Yeah, the violence is great and stuff.  But they've done some really clever stuff with the radio stations that you could, you  know, turn on in the car while you're cruising around.  And basically, the radio stations mock regular radio.  Right.  They mock it pretty badly, actually.  And it makes me laugh pretty hard.  But they have a lot of these fake commercials while you're driving around. 
[01:17:00]  And one is for a product to get rid of fat.  So check this out.  This is from Grand Theft Auto 3.  I've tried everything.  And I just couldn't keep those extra 200 pounds off.  It started to affect my marriage.  She was too big for me.  And I'll sleep with anything.  The abdometrics, the thiosizer, the tummy stapling.  I've had my mouth sewn up.  My hands chopped off.  You name it, I've tried it.  Except for exercising and eating right, Porky.  That's right, honey.  Then I found the Dormatron.  Using a new technology called biorhythmic subconscious gymnastics, the Dormatron exercises you while 
[01:17:30]  you sleep.  Just strap in your arms and legs.  Put on the Dormatron headset.  Then wrap yourself in the special high voltage electric blanket.  Turn it on to 11 and burn those pounds away while you have a relaxing night's sleep.  Now that I've lost 280 pounds, my husband's all mine again.  That's right, honey.  No more escort services for me.  Don't be fat a day longer than you have to.  Remember, being fat can even ruin a romantic cruise.  Call Dormatron now at 1-800-SLEEP-OFF-LARD or visit www.shutyourpiehole.com and sleep your 
[01:18:00]  way to a thinner, happier you.  You could slip that in between any of our commercials and you would never, ever frigging notice.  That's the saddest part.  I hear the websites they give out during the game, these fake commercials and these radio  stations are actual websites.  Are they?  Yeah.  Do they have them?  Like, they control them or are they just real websites?  I think they control them and they're having fun with that as well. 
[01:18:30]  I mean, the game is just beyond clever.  Matt, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey.  I usually don't agree with Anthony on a lot of things.  I'm pretty liberal.  But they should hang this guy, Walker, from the nearest tree.  Oh, Mr. Liberal.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They absolutely should.  They should.  And I totally agree.  And kudos for you saying it, man.  Because, you know, sometimes people get a little too liberal.  But, you know, we do live in the greatest country in the world and we lose sight of that  once in a while.  You guys sure do.  All right, Matt. 
[01:19:00]  Thank you.  All right.  Take care, man.  A lot of people do get me mistake, me, for conservative or Republican.  I am absolutely not.  There are just as many jack-off, douchebag Republican conservatives.  You go hard one side or the other, left or right, they're both equally as twisted,  demented, and brought up with all kinds of sexual problems.  That's what it is.  It's all the parents driving in that the weenie is bad and the coochie is bad. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  And either side is equally as bad.  I am somewhere in the middle, swear to you.  And I'll grab some philosophy from the hard one side and from the hard other side.  Doesn't matter.  Because I get crap all the time.  Oh, you conservative piece of crap.  No, I'm not conservative.  I'm sure not liberal either.  Thank you.  That's where I stand.  Ah, James, what's up?  James?  Are we on hold? 
[01:20:00]  How dare he put us on hold?  That's some bad hold music.  All right.  It's a Christopher Cross.  Anthony, breaking news.  Rock and Roll Tommy on the phone line.  Oh, he is.  Rock and Roll Tommy.  Yeah.  What's up, bro?  Hey, thanks a lot, man, for yesterday.  Oh, no problem.  You had fun with the homeless shopping spree.  You had to match up Psycho Mark with the...  He was an apple.  He was like beating Dracula in charge of the blood bank.  He's calling Psycho Mark and alcohol.  He was like, let's go to the bar.  And I'm like, let's go to the bar.  Like, you take the two biggest alcoholics at 18 people. 
[01:20:30]  But we had a great time.  You had a great time at the bar with Psycho Mark.  Did you end up buying anything, Tommy?  I got a couple of CDs.  More CDs.  Yeah.  What CDs did you buy?  I bought Laura Nero and Dawkins.  Dawkins.  You're going to be rocking with Dawkins.  Hey.  What was the other one?  Laura Nero.  What?  Laura Nero?  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You stumped up.  I'm kind of a panty.  I like those, you know, that kind of light kind of stuff. 
[01:21:00]  But I just wanted to call you and thank you.  No problem.  You didn't have anything stolen from you?  Hell no.  Did you get...  Tommy woke up, like, naked.  It was like buzzards had picked at him all night.  Are you kidding?  No.  All he had on was his...  He has his shoes, you know, but, I mean, he got all his sweatshirts and T-shirts and...  Tippy, you're saying that Tippy Tom got taken for all of his stuff?  Yeah.  And pretty much woke up naked?  Well, I mean, that's telling me a story, you know?  They were picking at him like buzzards? 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, I mean, that's telling me a story.  I mean, he just drops in the street, you know?  He doesn't set up, you know?  Oh.  Well, he's not a very calculated homeless person.  So he fell asleep.  He just drops down, you know?  He passes out, you know?  And other homeless people just came up and stole his jacket and his sweaters and everything  else that he got yesterday?  Yeah, actually.  Did the word get out on the street that...  But I'll tell you, if they hadn't have done that, he would have given it away.  Well, did the word get out on the street that you guys were coming back with some fine 
[01:22:00]  stuff?  Yeah.  I mean, you know, everything was fine, you know?  Yeah.  I mean, I had a great turn this week.  Cool.  Yeah, we had a lot of fun with you.  We're going to keep track of you, Rock and Roll Tommy.  All right.  All right, man.  Okay, thanks again.  All right.  Happy holidays.  You too, Tommy.  Okay.  There you go, Rock and Roll Tommy.  He still has his stuff.  Tippy Tom.  Well, he didn't buy much.  There's the first report the day after Tippy Tom plucked clean like vultures had gotten  to him.  Great.  Like the buzzards around a corpse. 
[01:22:30]  Boy, it's tough out there, huh?  Yeah.  Paul, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  I just got a quick question.  That commercial you just played?  Yeah, from Grand Theft Auto 3.  Was that a Lisa Orban piece?  Might as well be.  GTA rules and so do you guys.  I'm going to sell that one.  Thank you.  You guys are going to love it.  Want to hear another fake commercial from Grand Theft Auto 3?  This one's us.  This is from the ammunition place.  It's called AmmuNation.  The store that helped defeat communism is having a blowout sale. 
[01:23:00]  AmmuNation has a wide array of peacemakers.  Come by AmmuNation on Militia Mondays, exercise your Second Amendment rights, and get 10%  off all armor-piercing bullets.  We're the only gun store that lets you try it before you buy it.  Need anti-tank missiles?  We've got them.  Flamethrowers?  Oh, yeah.  No credit?  No problem.  No money down.  90 days.  Same as cash.  Shoot now.  Pay later.  During the 10-minute waiting period, fire off a few rounds in the AmmuNation gun range 
[01:23:30]  featuring faces of famous liberal pinkos.  Come by AmmuNation and register to win an anti-aircraft gun.  Actually used when we whoop Saddam's ass.  This weekend is the AmmuNation Film Festival with free screenings of Enemy of the State and  Red Dawn.  AmmuNation.  Protecting your rights.  They did a really good job with this stuff, didn't they?  I'm amazed they put that much work into just the radio audio in this game.  Because the radio stuff is just kind of background as far as the game goes, you know? 
[01:24:00]  We should play some of the positioning statements before we go to break from Grand Theft Auto  3.  Positioning statements.  Look at you with the radio lingo.  That's what it's called in the biz, Anthony.  A positioning statement.  And there's a fake radio station that you can tune into while you're cruising around Grand  Theft Auto 3 called Lips 106.  And here's some of their positioning statements to make you listen to the station.  You get it in.  Right.  All right.  Here it is.  Your attention, please.  Read our lips.  Yeah.  The best commercials. 
[01:24:30]  And pop fluff in between.  Lips 106.  The best commercials.  They are really mocking today's radio.  And you know what?  They're right on.  No, you got to hit the second one, man.  Yeah, the second one.  Check this out.  All your favorite commercials.  And great music, too.  Excuse me?  You're listening to Lips 106.  Lips 106.  And this is what you hear as you're driving over people.  Yeah, in between songs and stuff, yeah. 
[01:25:00]  Now.  Ten minutes of music guaranteed.  As soon as you wait through another nine minutes of messages from our sponsors.  Lips 106.  And we have one more.  We played this one earlier.  Here we go.  L-I-P-S-106.  Commercial radio at its best.  And proud of it.  Lips 106.  Oh, no.  Okay.  It's the last one here. 
[01:25:30]  This one, yeah.  Wasn't that just great?  Next week, we've got our big bi-monthly phone-in.  When you get the chance to win a meal for two at a fast food outlet of your choice.  As long as you choose one of our competition sponsors.  Finally, pop music's got a new voice.  Hello.  Welcome to Lips 106.  Hey, it's time for commercials.  I love them.  It sounds like a real radio station.  Yeah.  Tell you the truth.  There's a talk station on there that is really funny. 
[01:26:00]  Really mocks talk radio out there.  They're going to send us more stuff from Rockstar.  Yeah, that's what Mike is saying.  You got any of the talk radio ones?  They're funny as hell.  They're really funny.  And then there's another station where they just mock these big corporations that own all the radio stations.  One is like, we own 900 radio stations across America, so every radio station will sound exactly the same.  I've got to get through Wolfenstein, and then I'll start playing that.  Well, I made it to Staunton Island last night, so I'm rocking. 
[01:26:30]  What was your body count yesterday, you think?  Well, I spent probably two hours just killing people.  Just killing people.  Oh, yeah.  It's way up.  So it's in the what?  Hundreds, you would just say?  Thousands.  Thousands of people.  Thousands.  Oh, yeah.  Virtual people dead.  Yeah, because, I mean, this game, you could do the missions, but you could also just go off and do your thing for a while  and kill hookers and tourists and steal police cars and be a vigilante for a while.  You could jump in a fire engine and then put out fires. 
[01:27:00]  I'll have to jump on that.  You could be a cabbie and drop people off and then, you know, kill them and take their money.  How are the graphics, though?  Are the graphics good?  For a game console, unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  They've come a long way.  I mean, you look at some of the games Anthony plays in the back office, you can't compare  still, but they're getting better, man.  Well, my computer has thousands of vacuum tubes and weighs five tons.  Picks up a huge room.  What's up, Stig?  The cool thing is the stats.  Like, when you pause the game, they tell you how many people you killed, how many people 
[01:27:30]  you got someone else to kill, like if you hit a car and they ran into a person, how many  helicopters you've blown up, how many cars you've stolen.  They have all the stats.  It's great.  It's hilarious.  That's why you need that.  And I'm picking up on things every night.  The funniest thing is you could carjack the cabbies, right?  And then you could go into cab mode where now you're the cab driver.  Right.  And all of a sudden, the cabbies that you just carjacked is on the curb looking for  a ride. 
[01:28:00]  So you go, all right, well, let's see what he's all about.  You stop.  He jumps in and he asks you to go to the car dealership so you can get a new car.  He doesn't recognize you?  No.  Sometimes he'll pull you out of the car.  Yeah.  Sometimes, but very rarely.  Have you done that and then beat the crap out of him again?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I pretty much kill every person after I drop them off.  And then after I have sex with the hookers in the woods and stuff to get my health up.  Right.  And then they get out and I'll just beat the crap out of them with a bat. 
[01:28:30]  Nice.  That really bothers Sandy when she sees that part of it.  Really?  She's like, oh, I think she's dead now.  I'm like, oh, okay, okay.  But the cab driver, when you hijack his cab, you just throw him out of the car and then  take off?  Yeah.  And he's left on the street.  Oh, okay.  But if you kill him, obviously he's not going to be there later trying to hail a cab.  No.  He's dead.  There's a lot of surprises, especially when you're getting to know the game.  The other day, I jumped into this one car.  It was a mafia guy's car.  Ah, yeah.  Next thing you know, they come out of the woodwork with machine guns and they're firing at you. 
[01:29:00]  And by the way, I don't think it's you beating the hooker that bothers Sandy.  I think it's the moist tent in the front of your quarter voice.  Yeah, if you're the least bit excited when you're doing it, ooh, there's a problem.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Out of all the radio stations on that game, the best one is Chatterbox, the talk station.  Yeah.  And if you notice, some of the characters that you're playing with, like the Don that you're  working for, his voice is actually on there and he's talking about you, but you don't really 
[01:29:30]  notice unless you're paying attention.  Oh, really?  Yeah, his girlfriend calls up eventually and you'll hear that too.  No kidding.  Listen for it.  Yeah, the Chatterbox is the best radio station.  We're trying to, we've been calling Rockstar every day about Grand Theft Auto 3.  We want them to send us the audio of all these radio stations so we can play some of this  stuff.  I want to hear the talk ones because that's what I hear is really good.  Yeah, and they just don't get what we need.  So we're trying to communicate with them and hopefully they'll send the right stuff tomorrow  or Friday, all right?  The talk. 
[01:30:00]  The greatest game ever by far.  It's really good.  Thanks, Joe.  Made it.  All right.  You can tell it's good when it's being banned all over the place.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  It's the O&A Show.  Mario Cantone should be here in minutes.  We like when Mario stops by.  Stoner Sean, what's up?  What's up, dude?  Hey, man.  I'm sorry.  We're smoking a baller at Holt. 
[01:30:30]  Wait, this is the Stoner Show?  Indeed it is, my man.  What's up, man?  We haven't talked to you in a while.  Yeah, I know.  I'm sorry, man.  I just forgot the show was on.  Thanks for the support.  We really are.  Yeah, GTA 3, bro.  Oh, hold on.  Hold on.  All right, guys.  I'm sorry, man.  You said enough of that word.  Yeah, we had it done.  I stopped myself, though, yeah?  Well, F.  No, but GTA 3 is the sweetest game, man.  Have you guys tried using the sniper rifles and shooting people's limbs off yet? 
[01:31:00]  Oh, yeah.  The dude starts hopping around in the street.  It's important.  And with the sniper rifle I finally got last night?  Yeah.  They give you a nice head shot, man.  Do they?  Blood goes to them.  The head just explodes when you're up close.  It's the greatest friggin' thing ever.  Yeah, it's a sick game.  Oh, dude.  I swear we're not getting paid to talk about this game.  It's just that good.  I'm supposed to be taking finals and stuff.  Yeah.  I'm right here smoking a ball.  We're just revving up to play the game right now.  Oh, and you're supposed to be taking some kind of final. 
[01:31:30]  I feel like I have arthritis.  I play the game so much.  Yeah, I got a PlayStation thumb where I got that callus on the tip of my thumb.  I wish I had that.  The tips of my thumb, they're numb.  I cannot feel.  You're not playing enough.  You've got to quit your job, dude.  You will.  Everything else all right with you guys?  Yeah, we're doing pretty good, man.  We get out of school pretty soon, hoping to get some pot for the break.  It'll be good times, man.  I didn't know you were in school.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like I couldn't handle working and stuff. 
[01:32:00]  So you went to school.  Yeah, my parents gave me some money to live in a sweet dorm room.  Everything seems to be okay now.  Cool.  Hey, did you see the teen sluts on Maury?  There's teen sluts on Maury?  Yeah.  No, dude.  I miss daytime tea.  I slept too late to miss all the shows today.  Of course you do.  You're a stoner.  It was Wednesday night last night.  Wait, what night is it?  Wednesday today?  Wednesday tonight.  Yeah, we did something last night that made me sleep late, bro.  It's Wednesday.  Oh, sweet.  Nice.  I only have two days of classes left. 
[01:32:30]  I have rules, bro.  Yeah, you're all right, man.  Hey, Jim Brewer's coming in tomorrow.  I think we're going to break out Stoner Spelling Bay.  We better.  Nice.  So stay close so we can get you to play, all right?  Yeah, bro.  Brewer rules.  I can't wait, man.  All right, Stoner.  Later on.  Peace.  Booth.  There you go.  Stoner Sean.  Checking in, Anthony.  Yeah.  Jim, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  It must be so nice.  Yeah, you were talking about the sluts on Maury.  Do you see the 14-year-old whore that the mother wants to sue him?  Yes.  Because all she did was lay the limo driver for two or three days? 
[01:33:00]  Wait a minute.  14-year-old little slut girl on Maury.  And what did she do?  You know, they bought her in.  The name of the show was Out of Control Teams.  Of course.  And they bought her in for the show, and they got a limo for her.  They go from the hotel to the show.  And for two days straight, all she did was bang the limo driver.  And now the mother wants to sue Maury for like a million bucks or something.  It's in the paper today, right?  It's out of control.  Yeah.  Take it easy, guys.  All right.  It's page 33 of the post. 
[01:33:30]  Go to your workbook.  Dude, I read that.  You're a special girl.  I was packing like seven when I read that.  It was so hot.  You're always packing, though.  How do you know when it's a good pack?  Because if I peter out at like five, I'm like, eh, it's average.  But if I go seven or over, I'm like, this is a really good story.  Yeah.  And if I go over eight, I know it's not me.  Rick was giggling like a schoolgirl today because I think it was Springer had a show,  Why Are You Sleeping With Grandpa?  Why Are You Sleeping With Grandpa? 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, go get Rick because he was laughing so hard today.  All my page numbers never correspond with the goddamn ones Rick has written.  James, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  How are you guys doing?  Pretty good.  Oh, I already beat up on a GTA 3, so now I've just been driving around killing people.  See how high I can get my body count to go.  Yeah.  I figured out a nice cheat.  When you're in Stouten Island, if you know the tank code, you make like eight to ten tanks  and you block off the stairs leading up into the entrance of the stadium. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  Do the weapons sheet to get whatever weapon you want and just watch the blood and body parts fly.  Holy ass.  It's awesome.  You get all six stars filled up.  Uh-huh.  They send in the FBI and everything.  Yeah.  And it's just body count.  Helicopter after helicopter.  Rocket launchers blow them down.  You can do it like pinballs.  They come down real slow, hit it with like six rockets, and bounce it around the screen.  Do they finally get you, though?  Oh, sorry?  Do they finally get you?  Never.  I played in the same spot for over an hour, killed 1,300 people, and they didn't so much 
[01:35:00]  as hurt my armor.  See, I start feeling bad after I beat people up with the baseball bat and stuff.  No way, man.  You get so many weapons.  Molotov cocktails.  You beat up somebody, get a group of people around them, throw a cocktail, and watch like  30 bodies burn.  It's great.  The homeless guys got them in the tunnel, by the way.  Hell yeah.  The homeless guys in the tunnel?  Yeah, they got the Molotovs.  All right, James.  Thank you.  Thanks for another great tip.  Thanks, fellas.  Peace.  All right. 
[01:35:30]  See, you get desensitized after a while where all that killing won't affect you.  I know.  A few of the games I used to play, I'd be like, oh, it's kind of, you know, I'd just  hit the hooker on the head with a lead pipe or something, and there she is bleeding in  the street.  Kind of felt a little bad.  But then you realize, ah, it's just a game.  Kill, kill, kill.  That guy was saying he killed stadiums full of people?  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a stadium, and yeah, you can block the entrances, is what he's saying.  I guess if you go in.  Because I guess they'll start running out.  They'll start scattering. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, yeah.  So you block the entrance, and then just run in there and start taking people.  Oh, yeah.  Because I did kind of like the Michael Douglas, the falling down thing one time, where I  just stopped in my car in the middle of traffic and got out with an automatic weapon.  And just start raining.  And just start spraying bullets everywhere.  And they start freaking out, running in all directions, man.  How great is that?  But I'm not as violent on the radio show, Anthony.  I get my aggression out at home now.  It does work that way. 
[01:36:30]  It really does.  Yeah.  Oh, Rick, you're in the studio.  You were watching Springer.  Why are you sleeping with Grandpa or something?  Oh, yeah.  The first guess was, I'm having sex with your Grandpa.  I'm having sex with your Grandpa.  Yeah.  The show is so fake now.  Dude, but it was great.  Springer is ridiculous and fake now.  They act like, yeah, this hot 20-year-old trailer trash woman is sleeping with this guy  that doesn't have teeth and doesn't know where he is.  All right.  Well, this guy, he had teeth.  He barely had any hair. 
[01:37:00]  And he was in a wheelchair with a leg missing.  And his pant leg was tied up into a knot.  Nice.  It was hilarious.  Yeah, but you know something?  Dude, it's all fake now.  Jerry Springer is all just bad actors doing a bad play.  They're not real people.  They're not real white trash people.  They're bad actors.  I saw one the other day where a woman was talking about how she's in love with her appliances.  She was this fat bitch. 
[01:37:30]  She's in some bikini.  And then they, you know how they usually bring the guy on that's banging the wife  and then the husband comes in and they get in the fight?  They brought the washing machine on the stage.  The husband's yelling at the washing machine as the wife is sitting on it  and the vibration of the washing machine.  She's going to town on it.  Then the husband's yelling at her and the washing machine  and then, like, hits the off button on the washing machine.  Like, now he's punching the washing machine.  It's so fake.  There was one the other day that a daughter, I saw the ad for it, 
[01:38:00]  a daughter comes out, she had to be in her 20s,  and wants to marry her father.  But the father is getting married to some woman.  And the daughter comes running out in a bridal gown and goes,  I'm going to marry you, daddy.  And, you know, next Springer.  So I didn't see that one, but it's all fake.  They can't even act right anymore.  Like, even the old ones, when they started punching each other,  it was kind of cool.  They acted angry. 
[01:38:30]  Now it's just people standing there going,  I cannot believe you are doing this to me.  You know, it sounds phony.  It was great, though, because then they brought out another couple,  which was not a grandpa thing.  It was just a freak couple where this chick with a hump on her back  just staggers onto stage with her club foot.  It was great.  Yeah, that is funny for a freak show.  Yeah, it's like he's trolling the carnivals now for guests for a show.  Look at Paul E. from Lawrence.  Spring is no Yolanda, right, Rick?  Yeah, when are you going to bring in your tape? 
[01:39:00]  Rick was on Yolanda, saying he would never get married.  He's got a tape where he was on Yolanda, saying he'll never get married.  Never get married.  There's tape of him going, I'll never get married.  Why, Rick?  Why?  Oh, he told the whole world.  He told everyone in the world that was watching.  Because, well, I was agreeing with a guy on stage who was complaining that, you know,  he kept getting busted cheating. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  And he said it was in his genes.  And I agreed with him because, you know, I come from a, let's face it, Hispanics like to bang.  Hot young Spanish.  Right.  You are.  Ain't that the truth, by the way, Rick?  Well, my grandfather's got like 45 kids.  Oh, that was funny.  So you were, wait a minute, you were in the audience?  Yeah.  And then they asked you, like you wanted to comment?  Rick, you stood up.  I agree with the guy.  You were one of those plants, though.  Right.  Even though you told the truth. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, you were a plant.  Well, Rick, there was a time Rick wanted to kind of be an actor, right, Rick?  Yeah, I went through the acting phase.  And, you know, and they.  Mad Max or Rick on the bottom of the picture?  It was Rick.  Okay.  All right.  And they sent people like Rick on some of these shows to ask questions.  But then Rick really got into it.  Really?  And started confessing a little too much to the national audience.  Yeah.  You didn't have one of those awful, like, multi-posed headshots?  You know those headshots that have three different costumes?  No, I didn't have the Sears catalog.  The versatility of the actor.  The versatility.  You have a headshot there on one? 
[01:40:30]  I certainly do.  I haven't seen this one.  Why isn't this posted on Foundry?  You can find it.  Oh.  The Stress Factory website has it, I think.  Ah.  Look for the Norton headshot.  Yeah.  And where's the Rick headshot?  Uncutbucks.com.  Dealers.  Ricky, you've got to bring that in and the tape.  Come on.  We need your headshot and the tape.  Definitely.  Come on, man.  You've got to hook us up.  Ricky Delgado.  R-I-C-K-I-E. 
[01:41:00]  Was it Ricky?  No.  Oh, yeah, because that would be gay.  Admitting his grandfather had 50 kids.  45.  How many?  45 or 45.  45 kids.  Yeah, my grandfather.  His grandfather had 45 kids, really busting apart those Spanish stereotypes.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  My mother said he was a stud.  Well, I guess so.  How would she know?  What aim he must have?  Isn't that something?  I don't want to know, Rick.  She said, my mother said, he was a good-looking man. 
[01:41:30]  Well, good-looking man and a stud mean two different things.  Good-looking man.  A woman could be walking down the street and go, that's a good-looking man.  And no, a guy's a stud.  You've got to have a few miles of pipe put down.  You've got to talk from experience when you're a stud.  Mike, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  I think I'm Springer today.  I want to marry my dad.  Oh, you saw it?  Dude, it was sick.  It's fake, though.  I know, but still, the premise alone is sick.  This chick comes out in a wedding dress, like you said, and she said, oh, I'm going to marry my daddy.  I was with him last week, and yada, yada, yada.  They bring out her stepmother, which her father divorced, going to marry her again. 
[01:42:00]  He comes out.  I couldn't find you nowhere, so I ended up sleeping with my daughter.  It was good.  Yeah, that's what he said.  He goes, he couldn't find her, so he slept with his daughter.  And then the daughter's in love with him and wants to marry the father.  So, didn't the daughter and the stepmother get in a big fight on stage?  Yeah, don't know, fake, worse than the WWF type of crap, man.  See, it was always kind of entertaining to watch Springer when you knew somebody was going to really get punched in the face. 
[01:42:30]  They were showing people punching each other in the face, and it was great.  And then they got to the point where they weren't going to show the fights, so they would tape it right up until the fight started.  Then they'd cut away to the audience reaction, and that sucked.  So then people weren't watching, so now they fake fight.  You know, they still got the guy in there, the cop, to split him up, but it's so phony that I don't know who's watching this anymore.  What the hell were you watching it for?  Nothing better to do.  That's what I say.  I'm surprised people are still watching these shows.  Well, Maury and Sally Jessie take a whole different tack. 
[01:43:00]  They go with the freak show or wild teens.  You can't miss with wild teen boot camp shows.  It's the best.  And now we're looking at the one.  It was Maury, right?  Fourteen-year-old girl.  She's a wild teen.  What do these talk shows do?  They drag them out of Mississippi, where they might have three people to choose from to bang.  They're two brothers and one other guy.  And they bring them to New York City and give them hotel rooms and limos and let them get effed by whatever is walking the street that night. 
[01:43:30]  Look at Norton is packing now.  I am getting him so excited.  What does that do?  Isolate that.  What is that next show Sally Jessie is doing?  A female talk show host with heads like Rocky Dennis.  What an awful head she has.  Cops investigating a claim.  A Texas mom was 14-year-old daughter.  Allegedly went on a wild sex spree while in New York to tape a talk show. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, God.  That rocks.  Isn't that hot?  According to police, the girl who appeared with a 16-year-old from California,  she went out.  Yes, she was banging the limo driver.  Oh.  Damn it.  I wish that went through.  Holy ass.  Norton.  You wasted your best line of the day.  Oh, is that great?  You wasted your best line of the day. 
[01:44:30]  And he's on hold, too, the limo driver.  Not the limo driver, but the limo driver you were talking about.  Now, if you're going to book a family with a 14-year-old out-of-control teen,  put them up in a hotel room in New York for your show,  wouldn't you make sure there's some kind of...  If you cared like Maury cares, wouldn't you set up a chaperone and security or something  to make sure this wild teen, who obviously has a problem, 
[01:45:00]  not as far as I'm concerned, but, you know, has a problem,  wouldn't you make sure there are people available,  maybe even a social worker or some liberal tree-hugging idea like that,  if Maury, his whole thing is to help.  You know, hey, Maury, if you're just going to put this show on as a freak show  to titillate watching a 14-year-old out-of-control have sex, then fine.  I applaud you, Maury.  But if he's out there saying that he's doing this to help people,  another hypocrite, Opie. 
[01:45:30]  Let's see how many hypocrites we've talked about today.  That's right.  Yeah, that's my count, too.  Limo Ant, what's up?  Limo Ant!  Annoying Laugh Ant!  Douchebag!  He hung up.  Did you hear him in the background going,  Huh?  He hung up? All right.  Jason, you're next to the Opie and Anthony show. What's up?  Yeah, I was with this girl.  Yeah.  She was a stripper.  And some guy from the Jerry Springer show just went to the strip bar, 
[01:46:00]  picked a whole bunch of them,  and gave him this crazy story.  Like, five minutes before they went on stage.  Yeah, see?  They go to strip clubs.  They just go to places, give them a storyline, and say, run with it.  And they're such horrific actors, it's so easy to tell that it was fake.  And now they got the Springer cam.  This is a little feature where they take a camera to the people's home or place of work or something  and show a video of the women actually having sex with these other men 
[01:46:30]  so the husband can watch this horrible film and then react to it.  There was one where the Springer cam comes into the room  as a guy is confronting the boyfriend of his wife.  The wife runs out of the bed.  She's barely covered.  The husband's like, I can't believe you're doing this to me.  Rushes to the bedroom.  There's another man with the covers up to his chest in the bed.  He goes, get out of that bed.  The guy throws the covers off.  He has no lower body. 
[01:47:00]  He's completely amputated from the belly button down.  And then he goes, yeah, what are you going to do?  And starts chasing the guy around the house on his two hands, running.  It reminded me of Castle Wolfenstein, some of the creatures in it.  And he's running around going, get back here.  And the guy with the legs is running away from the freak that's walking on his hands.  And the woman's there just like, I love him.  He knows how to treat me nice.  And the guy kept saying, he doesn't even have a C. 
[01:47:30]  Well, that was like this morning with the grandfather.  The girl comes out, and she's just a pig.  And she's like, he treats me nice.  He rubbed my face, and he rubbed my back, and my feet.  It was disgusting.  Oh, there's Norton's head shot.  All right, that's nothing bad.  That's a good one.  I'm like a nine in that shot.  You don't look psychotic in that shot.  Anthony, what's up?  Oh, but I didn't want to talk to you guys.  I wanted to talk to Rick off the air.  I'd ask him a question.  Well, why during the show?  This is the hotline. 
[01:48:00]  This is like the line we only give out to a few people.  I didn't know that.  How did you get it?  Exactly.  Well, when he calls it for cars, when you guys want to find out about something coming over there,  I got to call him and tell him.  What cars?  He had a car a week and a half ago.  I got to ask him a question about one of the drivers.  Oh, was somebody being rude?  Um, no.  Come on, Ant.  As rude as you were to my sister?  Oh, yes.  A year later?  Come on, Anthony.  Drunk, belligerent Anthony, the limo guy. 
[01:48:30]  You were rude to your sister?  Oh, totally, dude.  Anyone else I should have hit.  Absolutely.  But I realize what a complete pathetic, drunk, obnoxious tool you are when you get drunk like that.  You're right.  I agree.  I was wrong.  You know.  Hey, what happened?  He walked up.  I never heard this.  Yeah.  Oh, come on, Anthony.  There was some kind of party going on?  Is this going to be on the next one?  We were at Hudson's in Long Beach.  I'm surprised you remembered.  And my sister was there, and she recognized Anthony, limo Anthony, and went over and said, 
[01:49:00]  Hi, Anthony.  I'm Dawn, Anthony from Opium Anthony's sister.  And he goes, Yeah.  Great.  Big whoop or something.  He goes, Pfft, and walks away.  No, I said, F them.  Yeah, F them.  You know, it was my sister just trying to be cordial, and the guy was a complete effing tool.  I agree.  So why you...  And I apologize on the air to hunt.  I really do feel bad about that day.  You know what the problem is, though, Anthony? 
[01:49:30]  You'd do it again in a second.  No, I wouldn't.  You'd be drunk at a party, and all of a sudden someone would come up and say something.  You're like, Ah!  No, it was a bad situation.  It was a bad situation.  I was having a fight.  I was having a fight with my ex-girlfriend.  I will not forgive you until you bring in a nice cold bottle of Dom Perignon.  You're on.  I'll see you Thursday.  See you.  Bye.  Thank you.  Bye.  You know what?  Easiest way to get great champagne.  The champagne will be here tomorrow.  Guilt that son of a bitch into getting it for me.  It works every time.  I love it. 
[01:50:00]  Howie, what's up?  Guys, you've got to go easy on Rick with his Orlando appearance, because you know he was just only putting on a facade.  A facade, which means a false front.  False front.  Later.  All right.  Can I say something about the Springer and the people they get?  There are, you'd be surprised how many, in real life, how many really dirty girls there are that fantasize about their dads and stuff.  And I really like those girls.  You're just trying, you're totally trying to get yourself worked out right now.  No, no.  I'm being really truthful.  You like all that incestuous stuff like that? 
[01:50:30]  Not with my family.  They're awful looking.  But I mean, if you're hot, your dad's got a big mule.  I'm behind you.  A lot of taboo movies have been made about the subject.  Yeah, of course.  I've seen all of which you have seen.  Dorothy Lemaire.  There was the other American taboo series with Paul Thomas and Raven.  Oh, look at this.  Of course.  But I'm talking about the original taboo with Kay Parker.  Yes.  And Taboo 2 was wonderful.  Honey Wilder.  And, you know, Kevin James died of cancer, unfortunately.  Ron Jeremy was in the orgy scene.  Aunt Peg.  And Kay Parker was a favorite.  It's absolutely so. 
[01:51:00]  It's a goddamn Ebert when it comes to...  Bambi's, one of Bambi's first porn appearances, by the way.  Yeah.  Yeah, no, I tell you, you'd be surprised how many dirty girls there are.  I mean, for real dirty girls.  Someone brought us in some of that Jap anime porno.  You know, I don't like it at all.  Stinks.  It sucks.  But there was a storyline.  There's always...  Here's the storylines with those things.  There's some kind of rapist guy who's just, like, torturing what seemed to me to be junior high school girls. 
[01:51:30]  And just making them drink from the mule.  And the sounds and the visuals and stuff.  But it's all the same.  The girls are just like,  Oh, stop!  What are you doing?  Oh!  Leave me alone!  No!  Not there!  Ah!  And they're just pulling and doing...  They'll flip around and do...  Can you see it alone?  Well, for some reason, and I don't know why.  Is it a law or something?  Sometimes the member is this glowing thing. 
[01:52:00]  Like, glows.  And the animated porn?  Yeah!  And then sometimes it's fine.  There was one that I was watching the other day.  It had a brother and sister.  The brother had this big house with cameras all over.  And he was watching people have sex in various rooms.  And he would always tune in on his sister, kind of self-doing.  And then, well, she looked to be a junior high school girl herself with these big pigtails and whatnot.  And then he finally did her, right there. 
[01:52:30]  And she was like,  Oh, big brother!  Oh, big brother!  You're so big!  And just, like, getting slammed by her brother.  You see, now, that type of stuff I don't like.  Well, where's the line with you, Norm?  I'll tell you where the line is, because I'm a real pervert.  But I don't like any type of stuff like that that I can connect to my own life.  Like, you understand?  Well, so the father-daughter thing isn't anything you can connect?  I don't know.  I'm a guy.  Okay.  But, you know, I have a sister.  Ah, right. 
[01:53:00]  Horrible.  This is awful.  I don't even want to read about it.  You'd never tag your sister?  Absolutely not.  No.  Would you tag your daughter?  I don't have a daughter.  And there's a reason why.  I don't even want to know the answer.  No, I wouldn't.  No, I wouldn't.  Of course I wouldn't.  But, no, tag sister, awful.  Hey, really fast.  Concrete Joe from West Islip writes, check out these quotes from Rich Voss' website.  He has quotes on his website?  Oh, yeah.  Probably apologies.  Do you know Amelia David?  No.  Amelia David writes...  I don't want money, and I'm dodging her. 
[01:53:30]  ...writes, what impressed me about Voss was his ability to adapt his material to different  venues and audiences.  What?  And then there's another quote that just says, a great dad.  Jessica and Ellen Voss.  That's right.  We forgot to tell you guys.  He had his daughters on the phone.  He's passing them around to us yesterday on the bus.  How old are those daughters now?  Nine and eleven or something?  Oh, boy.  Just getting to that age.  Did you ever see his website? 
[01:54:00]  Did you ever go to Rich Voss?  I'm not plagued.  Believe me, I don't want to plug Voss at all, because he's an awful man.  But it's RichVoss.com.  Yeah.  And there are these four bouncing or five bouncing heads.  It looks like something from the Howdy Doody days.  Oh, I see it.  There's six of them, yeah.  Oh, those awful bouncing heads.  Something from the Howdy Doody days.  Wait, look at it.  Oh, look at his head.  Is that awful?  It's like Katharine Hepburn and her sisters.  Here I am with the backwards hat.  Here I am with no hat.  The forwards hat.  Here I am with no hat and a mic. 
[01:54:30]  And it's bouncing.  And the mic is cut off.  Voss really is an ass.  He's got his daughters plugging his act.  That's great.  What's that first quote?  You want to buy a dryer?  Door.  Click thumbnail to view a larger image of Voss.  Voss, you know, it's just like a picture of him,  and then it's like, click it to view a larger image.  Does it just go to a one-picture, full-page of him?  Hell, he was a good-looking guy back in 1987.  Oh, God. 
[01:55:00]  I'll be.  And Voss is such a bum.  What was that shot taken?  There it is.  If you want, you're just a single picture of Voss.  He does a CD, and he thanks everybody,  and not one of his comic buddies.  This worm couldn't get enough industry.  Mentioned on it.  Thanks to the comic Bible, and, you know,  thanks to the improv in Irvine,  and not one of his friends.  Not me, Keith, or Patrice.  No.  He's a spickle man.  Complete ass. 
[01:55:30]  All right.  What happened to Mario?  Is he blowing us off?  He shouldn't be here any minute.  All right.  Mario Cantone, around the corner.  All right.  All right.  All right.  What?  He's a big kid.  He's a big kid.  Whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip.  He's a big kid.  Wednesday.  It's off the hook, yo.  Opie and dance.  Shoo.  You're checking out the Opie and Abney Show.  No, no, no, no, no, wake up.  Jim Norton in the studio. 
[01:56:00]  So, Adam from Valley Stream writes, Mario Cantone takes longer to arrive than a punchline to one of Boss's jokes.  Boss is just getting killed today.  Boss is very funny.  Can I?  Yes, go ahead, Jim Norton.  I've forgotten to do this, man.  I've got to do the right thing.  Huh?  No, no, I've got to do the right thing.  Oh, go ahead.  Because I remember that I had that thing with Rascals, and I thought of it because I clicked on the website.  I never mentioned that right after, remember the whole thing on the air?  I talked to Ed Rodriguez, the owner, and he was actually in Arizona when the thing went down. 
[01:56:30]  They sent me money, so I've got to say thank you to Rascals.  Oh, Rascals did the right thing with you.  And you know what?  I believed him.  I talked to him.  He was like, dude, why don't you just call me?  And I actually, like some guys are scumbags, but I really believed him.  I'm very happy to hear that.  Rascals is pretty cool.  Everything's good, man.  They have a lot of fun stuff on their website, too.  Yeah, well, what is that website, Anthony?  It's RascalsComedyClub.com.  RascalsComedyClub.com.  RascalsComedyClub.com.  And if you go there, you don't even have to go far on the other side.  There are some great, very entertaining things right on the front page that you get taken to 
[01:57:00]  when you go to RascalsComedyClub.com.  Really?  You know, right after the show, I'm going to check out their website.  I've never checked it out before.  I haven't even clicked on a link yet because I was just so entertained just from...  And you know something?  You don't even have to scroll that far down the front page  before you see something very, very funny on RascalsComedyClub.com.  It's great. 
[01:57:30]  If I didn't know you, Ann, I would think that there's more to this than what you're saying.  Now I see something funny on a website I'd like the listeners to...  Oh, all right.  Which website?  Laughalong, RascalsComedyClub.com.  Hey.  Voss, what's up?  What clone am I talking to?  First of all...  Hey, wait.  Time out before you start, my friend.  I've been protecting you today.  I love Voss.  I've said how funny Voss is.  I told people that you did a great job for us yesterday. 
[01:58:00]  I said you don't deserve this abuse, my friend.  That's okay.  I don't care.  The funniest comedian working in New York today, Rich Voss, everyone.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Norm's talking about my website.  Yeah.  Dead Zero doesn't even have business cards, okay?  If he wasn't in the studio right now, he'd be sleeping.  You are the most unproductive human I know, okay?  All your energy goes into is hookers and TVs, okay, pal?  I have a great website.  I didn't say you have a good website.  I just said that the little bouncing heads should not be there. 
[01:58:30]  And the quote from your daughter is rich.  What's that about?  I know.  I just threw that in.  And I gave out your website address because when people are there, they can also order your CD.  Oh, see?  Listen, you don't go to my website to order my CD.  You can go into the stores now and get it.  But anyhow, you know, I think it's a very good website.  There's a lot of stuff in there.  You can even see Rich Voss introducing Godsmack at Woodstock. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, how about that?  Okay.  Although it was the first Woodstock, it doesn't matter.  Okay, nothing on that one.  Nothing on that one.  I was cracking.  I just get in the car.  We're a little tired today, Rich.  I don't know, but I heard you guys trashing it.  I was crying.  I was laughing so hard.  And some girl called me and said, they're trashing you.  I go, I don't care.  But now I'm hooking up with her tonight.  So look it.  Everybody benefits from this.  All right, Voss.  Thank you.  All right.  I'll see you guys later.  All right.  There he goes.  Rich Voss. 
[01:59:30]  Dude, Voss has pictures of his apartment on his website.  What is that?  What a pig he is.  What website is worse, Kevin Meaney's or Rich Voss's?  Wow.  I think Voss's worse, but Meaney, very close.  Kevin Meaney has a cam?  He has a camera that is on a file cabinet in his garage.  Right.  I mean, what that's all about?  What is that?  It's like unless there's a dead hooker in that file cabinet,  and you want to make sure the cops haven't found it from another city,  you know, you can just log on and, oh, thank God, 
[02:00:00]  the cops haven't found the file cabinet with the dead hooker in it.  No one has checked the cabinet.  Yeah, thanks.  Isn't that a great thing to do?  All right.  You're thinking, right?  Oh, Mario, thanks for stopping by.  Well, Keith, thanks for having me without a lesbian orgy.  It'd be really nice to.  Yeah, only men in here today, Mario.  Oh, man.  Yeah, thanks.  And Mary.  Thanks for being on time.  We appreciate it.  I'm late.  All right, I'm late.  I have a lot of things to do.  No problem.  No problem.  I was home.  Especially today when we were going to, you know,  just jump on your back and let you ride this train today.  Well, I'm here.  I get an hour. 
[02:00:30]  You know, last time I was here, I stayed too long at the fair, I thought.  Well, there were things going on.  There were too many things going on.  Oh, how's Squirt?  You were here for Squirt?  Yeah.  I can't remember that I was here having to watch that lesbian orgy.  With Vanilla Ice and Squirt?  Oh, yeah.  It was nice being Vanilla Ice's sidekick last time, too.  Thanks for nothing, you ass.  You piece of crap with the dung on your head.  Oh, my God.  It's so good to be here.  I have a little song that I've done for you.  I've made The War a musical.  Osama Bin Laden, when he was in pigtails, Osama Bin Laden, nah, the man is a two-faced, 
[02:01:00]  a worrisome thing that leads you to sing the blues in the night.  I thought I'd just do that for you.  I think there's a mindset that has to be behind a song like that.  Oh, is there a mindset?  I don't get it.  What about the last part of it?  Of course.  I know.  I know.  Hey, guess what?  Mila is just getting married.  I know.  To David Guest. 
[02:01:30]  No.  He's G-E-S-T.  David Guest.  He's so terrific.  I mean, he's so attractive.  What is he getting married?  He's so attractive.  We're talking attractive.  He's so attractive.  He was a promoter for Michael Jackson's conscience.  Oh, really?  Oh, my best friend.  And guess who's going to be my best man?  Oh.  Tito Jackson.  He is, I swear to God.  Is Tito going to be?  Michael Jackson is my best man, and oh, my God.  And all the guests, Elizabeth Taylor, is going to be my maid of honor. 
[02:02:00]  Is Ringling Brothers just going to open a side show and just let people walk through this wedding?  It's going to be horrible.  Elizabeth Taylor will be, like, walking down the aisle going, where is my bouquet of fun?  Yes, I can't find my bouquet.  My slip is showing.  Is that a wig she still wears?  Oh, that's a Disney fireworks coming out of her head.  I don't know what that is.  Because I know after she had that tumor removed from her head, or whatever that was. 
[02:02:30]  What?  I never had a tumor.  The only tumor I had removed from my head was Richard Burton.  I don't know.  She had something removed.  She was going around with her shaved head for a while.  I like that look.  It looked like she looked like the singer from Disturbed for a while.  She really had a shaved head?  Yeah.  She had the turban on it.  And then it started growing in the natural gray.  Oh, God.  And now it's back to that big, like you said, Disney fireworks.  Oh, it's brutal.  Can I just quote Liza Mellie and Liz Smith Colm today? 
[02:03:00]  I was raised Episcopalian.  And, you know, that's what I am, and I'll always be that.  So I have not been a studying Catholic.  I don't study Catholicism.  Studying?  No.  And I don't take catechism classes on Wednesdays at St. Patrick's Church with Cardinal Egan's age.  We're going to be married March 16th at St. Thomas' Episcopal Church.  We're inviting 1,200 people.  Oh, my God.  Guest is coming.  Patty Austin, Michael Feinstein. 
[02:03:30]  And Patula Clark, Michael McDonnell.  Patula Clark is alive?  Yes.  Downtown.  Did you see the commercial they did?  I thought she was dead.  They saved me all night.  And Michael McDonnell, who I love to death.  Do you like the Michael McDonnell?  Michael McDonnell.  I love it.  From the newbies.  Do you know, doesn't he look just like Sam the Snowman and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer?  Have a holy joy.  It's the best time of the year.  I don't know what you want to do.  John wants to say hi to Mary.  Hi, John.  John, what's up?  Will you go away?  No, I will never go away. 
[02:04:00]  I will watch you forever.  Thunder fluid on my body.  Getting ready to light the match if you don't stop.  I will never go away, John.  I will hunt you with the rest of my year.  The best part, though, it says on the screen, please make her go away.  I love it.  Yes.  Well, you know what?  You know what Michael Musto called me in his column last week?  The funniest man and woman.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, Solomon, I'll end.  Burn up.  That's wacky.  Yeah, that's wacky.  Hey, someone wants to say hi to you.  Hi, Gary.  Our buddy, Gary.  11-year-old Gary.  Gary, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I just want to say, Mario, you know my aunt. 
[02:04:30]  I do?  Penny.  Penny.  What's the last name?  I'm not sure.  You don't know your aunt's last name?  No.  She's my dad, like...  Penny.  I don't know.  But you will know my dad, and his name's Gary.  Gary, yes.  I have a picture of you with Rosa.  Oh, of course.  I know.  Oh, yes, yes, yes.  Okay.  You know what?  I'm a little foggy today.  Were you on Steam Pie, Patty?  No.  I'm just kidding.  He was an egg when you were on Steam Pie.  Yeah.  How old are you? 
[02:05:00]  You're 11?  He's 11.  Oh, God.  Well, you know what?  I'm 92.  My birthday was last week.  Well, then tell your aunt Penny.  Penny Lane?  Penny.  Penny.  Penny.  Penny Louise or something.  Penny Louise or something.  Penny Louise.  He doesn't even know.  Well, John, I'm glad you called.  All right, Gary.  All right.  I called you, John.  Gary.  Thank you, Gary.  Ready for that hockey game?  Give me a rule.  Dice sucks.  See you.  I don't like your language, young man.  11 years old. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, my God.  He likes the GTA Grand Theft Auto, and he doesn't like dice.  Vito.  Mario.  Vito.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, man.  What up?  Hey, listen.  I just read it in the paper.  I got it right here.  It says here that Cartman is planning for wet Catherine Hepburn.  Oh, that's a good thing.  Imagine that?  Yeah, I could imagine that.  Will you marry me, Catherine?  Stop shaking, you piece of crap.  What's going on?  Get over here, you little bastard.  I'll kick your ass.  You walk down the aisle with me, I'm going to shove a bouquet up your big bunghole.  You son of a bitch, I hate you, you fat old calf. 
[02:06:00]  When are you going to die?  You're not marrying me, you're a lesbian.  You like to eat.  Hey, Mike, what's up?  Isn't today the butters episode tonight?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm going to watch it.  All butters.  All butters.  All butters all the time.  Yeah.  What are they going to...  It sounds like a good...  Oh, wait.  Did you see the immobile one?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that was the one where...  It was genius.  Mr. Garrison.  Mr. Garrison's like, and what you have to do...  Yeah, you have to sit on this thing.  You have to sit on the pole.  It doesn't just...  You don't just sit on it. 
[02:06:30]  You actually become one with this machine.  And then you put your mouth on the front part.  You put your mouth on the front part, and you've got to pump this thing with your mouth  as you jerk both of the handles that are in front of you.  It's unbelievable.  And as you squat up and down on this thing that is supposed to be a seat that becomes  one with the person driving it.  It's a big wheel that goes all the way around you.  It's awesome.  And he's driving this thing just...  And the people are riding, they're pumping it with their butt, and they're jerking the  handles and sucking on the control thing. 
[02:07:00]  It's unbelievable.  It's so damn funny.  And then they ask them why you had to have this thing with your butt, and why you had  to suck on it and pump the handles.  And he had no reason for it.  The guy said there are things at the bottom that you can steer the thing with anyway.  And he goes, why do we have to sit on this and suck on this thing?  And he was like, well, I guess you don't have to.  You don't have to.  You don't have to.  And then everybody's like, wait, wait, what did he say?  What did he say?  This machine is raping you pretty much.  Katie Cork has a $65 million contract. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, $65 million gummy grin.  She's a little gummy.  Okay, did anybody...  She's a little gummy.  She's a little gummy in the gums.  Did anybody watch Rudolph this year?  Has it aired yet?  No, I don't even know or care when it airs.  Come on, that's the best special in the world.  You know something?  After I reached a certain age, it just didn't do anything.  I watch it every year because it's such a sick special because that father is so mean to him.  And he's like, no son of mine is going to have a red nose.  What he's really saying is, no son of mine is going to be a little faggot. 
[02:08:00]  That's what he's really saying.  Oh, exactly.  That's what he's really saying.  And then he puts that thing on there and he's like, you get over there and you play Raiden  games and that Comet, that gym teacher, he's evil.  He's like, all right, all right, come on, you guys, come on, come on, come on, let's go,  come on.  And then he meets Clarice Rudolph.  He's like, Rudolph, I think you're cute, you're cute.  And he flies and he's so excited.  And the kids start playing with him and they hit his nose and it comes off and it's like,  what?  And the red thing.  And they're all like, holy crap.  And they freak out and they've got a hard-on in the shower in gym class. 
[02:08:30]  And he's like, no way.  And Santa says to the father, too bad, he had a good takeoff.  You should be ashamed of yourself.  See, shame comes from the top and trickles down.  Santa, he's, and then he goes to the island of Misfits Choice and it's just so brutal because  that Charlie in the box is like, nobody wants a Charlie in the box.  Rudolph, let go of my key.  He's so ridiculous.  You're dragging me too tight.  And then.  That is a flamboyant jack in the box.  And then Santa at the end is like, Rudolph, with your nose so bright, won't you guide my safe  Slayton, if I was, if I was, I would have been like, let me tell you something, Santa. 
[02:09:00]  You humiliated me my whole life.  Go crash and burn.  Wow.  He's a fat bastard, that Santa.  Mario, who, who's your Santa?  My Santa.  Who was the person that was Santa to you?  Oh, God.  Being, being that mean.  My bookie uncle.  My bookie uncles.  They're like, they're in the room like watching games.  Like, I dropped the ball.  I'm like, shut up.  I'm trying to watch The Wizard of Oz.  Shut up.  Okay.  Did anybody ever see The Little Drummer Boy?  That's another great Rankin-Bass special.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, that's brutal. 
[02:09:30]  I haven't seen it recently.  Oh, it's because they don't play it anymore because it's not on the network,  not on television anymore because they say that it's racist.  Really?  Yeah, because they, they, they say they represent Arabs as terrorists.  Well, that's it.  Oh, jeez.  I was like, well, and, yeah, what are you talking about?  And then he's evil.  The Little Drummer Boy is like this angry, angry, he's got these arch eyebrows and he walks  around with the drum going, oh, you hate people, all people.  And he's so, and Greer Garsten is the storyteller.  Greer Garsten, The Little Drummer Boy, was a miserable.  The Little Drummer Boy, he hated people, old people, I hate people, old people. 
[02:10:00]  And he's banging his drum.  Yeah.  He's got a lamb and a, and a, and a, and a camel and a, and a goat.  And he's like, he makes them dance.  And they dance to the drum.  And then he's, yeah, he's like, faster, you stupid camel, faster.  Oh, that's right.  He was really nasty like that.  I'll make a rack of lamb out of you.  Go faster, dance.  He's so mean.  And then at the end he sees Jesus and he's still pissed off.  He sees, he's like, I have to get in to see the babe.  And he goes up front and he, do you think he's going to lighten up because the babe's  beautiful and he's, he's still like, I have no gift to bring.  No, he's pissed.  He's like, I have no gift to bring. 
[02:10:30]  He's pissed.  And you know why he's still pissed?  Because Jesus isn't like, come into the manger and stay with me.  He's still a roaming orphan in the sands of the desert with, with, with Ben Hatterman  who was a wily old desert jackal, said Greg Austin.  He hated people.  What?  Why were they portrayed as being terrorists?  Because they are.  I mean, how is it brought about in the show?  It's very dark and they kill, I'll tell you how.  I left that out.  They kill, they do a flashback.  They kill his mother and father.  These, these desert, you know, bandits, they call them, come into the house. 
[02:11:00]  It's when, yes, the little drama boy, when he wasn't always angry, he was a happy little  boy.  And he runs up the hill and the mother's like, he's like, mother, father.  That's all he says.  Mother, father.  They're like, look, little drama boy, we have a drum for you.  He was like, oh, my drum.  And then cut to the night and the bandits come in and throw a knife at the, these are  Frankenstein stop action puppets.  They throw a knife at the father.  Oh, you see his face.  He dies.  They burn the house.  The mother's in there getting the kid out the window.  He takes off.  The mother burns.  Sand monkeys.  Sand monkeys. 
[02:11:30]  Cowhead.  Son of a bitch.  I hate you guys.  Sand monkey.  Listen, Mickey.  Why don't you go knit me a sweater before I slap you in the face?  Hey, listen, Mickey.  Why don't you go knit me a sweater before I slap you in the face?  I'd love to duplicate.  Man, you could do that without machines.  We had Matt and Trey on.  Did you?  Yeah, they need all that equipment to do the Harmon voice.  I was like, wait, wait, don't do that.  What equipment?  Just do it.  Yeah, they throw it.  Like they pitch it up a little bit. 
[02:12:00]  They pitch it up throughout three machines.  Yeah, I know they pitch up Stan and Kyle, but they pitch up Tom.  Yeah, no, even Carmen, yeah.  Can I ask you a question?  When were they here?  It's been a while.  Yeah.  Live for them.  Live for them.  We've had them on the show many, many times.  I love them so much.  They're so talented that it's not even funny.  All right.  Is that a bitch?  I refuse to watch South Park.  Why?  Why?  Jim?  I heard it's great just because.  You've never seen South Park?  Nope.  I might have seen one episode.  Wow, I think you would enjoy it.  Just because it's so hip to be nasty in a cartoon.  No, but Jim.  I'm not going to show.  I want you to see it.  But if you or I say something as comics, well, we can't air that before six because there's 
[02:12:30]  kids.  Oh, yeah.  That's true.  They do do that.  I can't watch cartoons.  That's not their fault, though.  And they ripped off my bucket of AIDS line.  I really did.  Oh, they really did.  They did.  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  Yeah.  I can't.  Don't say, don't make fun of a crippled person on Premium Blender.  They'll cut it.  How about a nice bucket of AIDS?  Yeah.  Okay, can I just say one more thing before I get off the Christmas special thing?  Yeah.  What about Frosty?  Yeah.  That fat piece of slush.  I do not like him.  I got to tell you something.  Happy birthday. 
[02:13:00]  It's like, you know what?  Get the right holiday, first of all.  Second of all, he's a pedophile.  He takes the little girl into the greenhouse, gets all hot and melt.  He's a pig.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I remember Billy G. Will playing the evil villain.  I couldn't tell you who that was, no.  Nothing, nothing, nothing.  Oh, he's so gay.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Notty, notty, notty.  Messy, messy, messy.  That was kind of one of the newer things that they came up with, you know?  Yeah, it wasn't that good.  When you're a kid and you're watching Rudolph, that's one thing.  And they did the sequel with Shelley Winters as the bride. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, really?  Frosty's bride.  She's like, I'm so, I'm really cold.  I'm so fat, I can't even, where's my vagina?  I can't find it.  It's too cold in here.  Frosty, where's my ring?  I can't carry a bouquet of slush.  This is Peter Pan.  I'm not.  I can't.  Frosty.  Frosty, put it in, Frosty.  Is it in yet?  I want to have a baby with you, Frosty.  I want to have a little Frosty Jr. 
[02:14:00]  Is it over yet?  Did you do it?  Did I ovulate?  Yeah, Len from New York City, and I guess he typed this in a little while ago.  He goes, Mario, I suppose next you're going to accuse Frosty the Snowman of being a pedophile.  I guess you missed it.  You should write for me, Len.  That's a good idea.  Osama Bin Laden.  Can you do a little Shelly Winters on the Poseidon Adventure?  I love that.  Manny, you okay, Manny?  Let me find the Christmas tree. 
[02:14:30]  Mrs. Peter Pan, I'm not.  I like what she does.  I can swim.  I can swim.  I want the swimming pool.  She used to be a swimmer.  I was a swimmer.  She's underneath the water.  Just big, fat, underwater, Shelly Winters.  It's like a manatee.  She looks like a big, fat, giant squid from 20,000 leagues under the sea.  And then she comes up, and she's like, she has a heart attack, and then her death seat's like, Manny.  Give this medal to the kids.  I'm not going to say it.  She had a big bust of pork loin before I throw into the water. 
[02:15:00]  I didn't mean to.  She's dead.  Yeah.  I just saw a trailer for that.  For some reason, Fox has a channel that plays old, kind of bad movies from the 70s and whatnot.  I love that movie.  Porky's was on last night, which is just like an awful movie.  And they showed it the trailer for The Poseidon Adventure.  I never know why anyone went to the movies based on those trailers.  They're horrible.  Gene Hackman in The Poseidon Adventure. 
[02:15:30]  It was the same voice.  Irwin Owl, Alan brings you such horror that can never be believed.  And it was just a bad voiceover doing it and bad clips.  Roddy McDowell as the waiter.  Wow.  I got to see that.  I know.  And Carol Lindley as the lounge act.  There's got to be a morning.  And they're showing all that.  Ernest Bargnine.  Trailers were always bad in the 70s.  Really bad.  Ridiculous.  The voice and the graphics, the words that would come in, like sheer terror would go on the screen. 
[02:16:00]  It's going to be sheer terror at this thing.  Sheer terror.  Not only is he telling me, I'm reading it.  So there's got to be sheer terror.  And The Towering Inferno was the same movie, except with the building on fire, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Replace boat with building.  Paul Newman as the building manager.  And O.J. Simpson.  Simpson as the murderer.  I tell you.  As his wife's killer.  You're forgetting, though, man, that the sequel to The Poseidon Adventure with Christopher Lee.  Oh, my.  Oh, yes, yes, yes. 
[02:16:30]  And Michael Caine, was it beyond The Poseidon Adventure?  I think it was beyond.  And Sally Field.  Beneath the planet of The Poseidon Adventure.  It was something like that.  It was Sally Field, too.  I think it was beyond The Poseidon Adventure.  It had to do with some kind of crime.  What did it mean?  And was it the other side of the ship that nobody knew about?  I believe there was some kind of booty on the ship, is what it was.  Like some kind of gold or something.  And the people that were living on there the whole time?  Get in there.  Had they?  Yeah.  They would have been sunk by then.  I know.  Oh, God.  Horrible. 
[02:17:00]  But the Shelly Winters part that I saw on the trailer was just great.  It was the part with her.  And they showed her swimming under the water.  I was just like, oh, she should come up with those speedboat blade marks on her back.  They swim kind of slow in the Florida water.  And her hair is like, it's very, you know who she looks like?  She looks like the big evil squid in The Little Mermaid.  Remember The Little Mermaid?  She's like, you know, she had that hair that was all moving.  Oh, yes.  I love Shelly Winters.  I like her on Inside the Actor's Studio, which is like, I screwed all my leading men. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, yeah, all of them, Burt Lancaster, James Francis, Lauren Bacall, she has the biggest  role.  James Francis.  Well, let's take a break.  We needed this pick-me-up today, Mario, so thank you.  I'm sorry I'm late.  I feel bad.  It's all right.  We did our homeless shopping spree yesterday, which was a huge success.  But we're feeling it today.  Can I just be territorial and a little honest with you?  I just like being with you guys alone.  I don't need no lesbian audience.  No.  I love being with you.  None of that.  Because, you know, if you're not alone here, it's going to be some kind of a debauchery 
[02:18:00]  of sex.  Oh, my God.  We were going to do a contest for you today.  Great.  What was it?  We might do it either Friday or early next week.  Have a day.  We're going to have guys, let's just say, relieve themselves as much as they can between  3 and 6.30 into a condom.  Yeah.  And then what?  And whoever relieves themselves the most.  The most without breaking it.  That's the key.  We'll win a Xbox.  Osama bin Laden! 
[02:18:30]  See, we'll weigh it, I guess.  That's how it's going to work.  Okay.  Yeah, we're going to weigh it.  It's going to be weighed.  We're going to have a big kiddie pool they have to stand in just in case there's a mishap.  This is some strategy because you're going to want to get more than the other guys got  in there.  But if you think it's going to break, you might want to hang out and wait because the other  guy might break.  You know, you might think it's just a stupid, wacky little bit, but there is a lot of strategy  involved because the guys will not be allowed to go to the bathroom to relieve themselves. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, no.  So if they think their condom's getting filled too much but they still have to go, let's  say, they've got to kind of figure it all out.  How much water to drink.  Right, right.  Maybe hold it in.  You're going to do it here or are they going to do, what do you mean?  That's going to be done here.  Here.  No way.  Maybe Friday.  We might do it in two days.  In a kiddie pool somewhere way out of our area.  So basically we'll have a lot of water around and they drink the water and let nature take  its cough.  They have to pee in a condom. 
[02:19:30]  Why is someone saying this?  What I learned today, just found video clips always funny.  Hmm.  I wonder what that's all about.  I have no clue.  I have no idea.  Hey, are you plugging something, Mario?  Yes, I will be at Caroline's the 16th and 17th of this week or Sunday and Monday night  and then again on the 23rd.  So it's this Sunday and Monday.  When are they going to give you a Saturday?  You always say that they give me Saturdays anytime I want, but I just like Sundays and Mondays.  I like those nights because you want to come on a Saturday.  But I'm going to tell you something.  Here's a little secret.  Yeah.  Even though I shouldn't say this, on Saturday nights, I don't do the full show. 
[02:20:00]  I have to cut it short.  Only because they have like three other shows after me and they have to keep it tight.  But when I'm there on a Sunday, I do the musical numbers.  I do the whole theatrical bit.  You get rave reviews from our listeners.  I went to see Louis Black Sunday and you were supposed to come on at 10 o'clock after  he was on the website.  It said Mario Cantone on at 10 after Louis Black.  And you know, we're sitting there going, stood up again.  Malego.  Malego.  Sit up again. 
[02:20:30]  Look at me.  Erica Patoopi.  America Patoopi.  You're fabulous.  You're whatever.  You're Erica Patoopi.  I wouldn't want to sit behind you in a movie.  You're fat.  Melissa.  That is just a skeleton with a latex glove pulled over it.  She is quite frightening.  And everybody, it's the same thing as Liz.  Everyone's got to tell them how beautiful they are when they say, let me just tell you, 
[02:21:00]  you are so beautiful.  They tell her that.  And it's just awful.  She looks like a skull with a latex glove.  She looks very tight.  Hold over.  And pointed.  Well, the old line, one more facelift, she's going to have a goatee.  Goatee and bad breath.  And then my belly button me into my eyeballs.  All right.  Mario in the studio.  Really giving us a nice pick-me-up today.  Oh, I needed to come here, you know.  Cool.  We'll continue with Mario next.  Okay.  Break it down. 
[02:21:30]  Please wow.  We love seeing boobs.  Please wow.  Love it.  Yes.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Everybody can run around the street.  Yeah, close up.  Rip a loud weapon.  A brilliant idea.  Swing.  There's the cure for cancer.  You're ignorant.  Yes.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Mario Cantone in the studio playing Sunday and Monday at Caroline's in New York City.  We get rave reviews from our listeners every time we play Caroline's, Mario.  I should tell you that.  The email comes in like crazy. 
[02:22:00]  It really could.  I'm glad.  Yes.  That makes me very happy.  Because I work hard and I try so hard to be good for all the children.  The children.  The children love me.  Miss Crawford wants that studio at 58 degrees.  I want to know one thing.  When did I ever do Mike Tyson and Joan Crawford?  I think you were doing Tyson.  Yeah, it was a Tyson-Crawford thing back and forth.  Somebody was commenting on what it was.  I'll beat the crap out of you, Mr. Tyson.  We'll have to dig that up again because I doubt we can recreate that bit of magic.  We can.  It was in the moment.  That bit of magic. 
[02:22:30]  It was in the moment.  You've got to do it in the moment.  Otherwise, you're all right.  I will.  And that's the number, 45?  What?  Julie.  Hello?  Hello?  Hi.  Who are you talking to?  I'm sorry.  My husband.  He was making me promise I'd call you guys a bunch of crumpet munches if I got on the air.  It's drippy munches, drippy munches.  Here you go.  Sorry.  How are you doing?  All right.  I can barely hear you.  I don't know if it's my phone or what.  I can barely hear you.  We can hear you.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let's play a little game with Mario.  Julie, just say something else.  Anything you like. 
[02:23:00]  I absolutely adore you, Mario.  I was hoping that you'd tell me if you...  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  Don't say anything more.  Okay.  Where is this girl calling from?  Um, oh, God.  Why are you asking me this?  Talk a little more, Julie.  Just tell her how much you love Mario.  I love you, Mario.  Was it...  Was she here for the lesbian orgy?  No, no.  It's just a caller from somewhere in the country.  From Boston?  There you go.  Ah.  Absolutely.  Of course.  Well, my hometown, no.  And I was hoping that you could tell me you'd be coming home soon.  I've been trying to get out to New York to go to Caroline's, but it's kind of tough 
[02:23:30]  since you play mostly Sunday night.  I know, I know, I know.  Mario believes there's a force field around Manhattan and there's no way he can ever step through.  I'm a little agoraphobic.  You know, people are like, come to the South.  You're so funny.  People ask me, you're so funny.  People, you've got to come to the South.  You know what?  This is me in the South.  Lynch the faggot.  Hanging from a tree with Billie Holiday's strange fruit playing in the background.  I'm too afraid.  I am too afraid to go, like, to South Carolina.  Let me tell you something.  I did the show last week.  So are you trying to say people in the South don't have an open mind? 
[02:24:00]  Oh, I think plenty of them do.  Those people come up to you and go, come to the South.  You're in the South.  Me in Texas, I'll be hanging from an oil rig.  It'll be over.  But I love Boston.  That's my hometown.  I just haven't been.  You know what's so funny?  I just sold, we just sold my father's house because he died a few years ago.  We just sold the house.  So it's depressing to come home and see, I can't drive by the house.  I can't go in.  And I heard the new people that live there are very cold.  They're cold.  Oh, really?  Yeah, there's a lot of cold people up here, I hate to say.  Yeah, I think it's a little abrupt sometimes.  But there's also some great people.  So you go up to Boston, though, and there's no, like, house to... 
[02:24:30]  No, there's no house to go.  Merry Christmas.  I have no gift to bring.  Forget it.  I don't have a gift to bring.  I have to go and drive by a house and be like, where is the house?  No, and we have no place to do Christmas.  So the family's coming here.  They're coming.  Well, that's nice.  Don't think you'll have a nice Christmas.  Oh, off the earth.  You are horrible.  Oh, shut up.  You are horrible.  Okay, lower that right now.  Now, see, they're making fun of the fact that I have no point to that story, which somebody  has called and said. 
[02:25:00]  I can't laugh there.  I don't always have a point.  I just ramble.  Oh, I thought it was a cute little story.  It was a little accent.  It's true.  It needed a little rim shot.  But Julie, Julie is your name?  Yes.  I will try to come up to Boston.  Marios.  You know, where am I?  What club should I play?  I don't even know where to go.  Anywhere you go, I will go.  I've been checking out your website.  The Comedy Connection.  Okay.  Well, let me tell you.  I love the Comedy Connection.  They take care of us every time we go to Boston.  Oh, all right.  Well, that's where I would play.  Look, let me tell you something, Julie.  You should play the Comedy Connection in Boston.  Seriously.  Oh, all right.  How are you agoraphobic, but you can't leave the biggest city in the world? 
[02:25:30]  I get around the city plenty.  I can't leave.  I take the subway.  I have no fear.  They can blow anthrax up my ass if they want to.  I have no fear in the city.  It's when I go to South Carolina to Bunghole Comedy Club that I get afraid.  Okay?  I don't blame you.  You know, but I do.  I've played the Comedy Connection before.  I loved it.  I used to play Nick's years ago, too.  You know, I had a good time.  Oh, look at you playing both Comedy Club.  I did play both.  Got to make sure I mentioned both.  Well, because, you know, I played both.  I didn't play Juggernauts or whatever the hell that other club is. 
[02:26:00]  But, you know, I'll be down, Julie.  You know what?  Get in your car.  Drive down.  You come here.  Come to New York on Sunday night and come see my show.  Hey, are you going to be on The View tomorrow?  I will be on The View tomorrow.  Man, we're like the stop before The View.  Who else is on The View?  Gene Simmons.  Gene Simmons.  I didn't think we had something in common with The View.  And who else?  Ron Jeremy, right?  Ron Jeremy, Gene Simmons, and our own Mario Cantone here all do our show before The View. 
[02:26:30]  Very strange.  Ron Jeremy did The View?  Yeah.  Now, here it is.  Get this.  Now, I know you're doing The View and everything, and everything's fine.  Barbara Walters, she had a problem with Ron Jeremy being on the show.  She had this whole thing.  Now, me personally, I did not want Ron Jeremy on the show, but I talked to the other girls  and they said, and they kind of talked her into it.  Like, but she wanted everyone to know, look, I don't want him on here. 
[02:27:00]  And then I'm saying, this son of a bitch, that traitor from America that went to the Taliban.  You know damn well if he started, like, making these little signs that he wanted to be on some of these talk shows,  she'd be the first one that would go, oh, please do my show, let me do it.  She would be the first one.  Now, who's worse?  Ron Jeremy, who's given just joy to so many people, Norton alone, I mean, I don't know how many times.  My opinion is, Ron Jeremy, I love Ron Jeremy, I think he's hysterical.  He has humor within the porn, which I appreciate. 
[02:27:30]  He's a funny guy.  And he was great in Orgasmo.  I'd have him on my show.  Hey, look, I get on that show, The View, and I, you know, I'll rip some celebrities a new one,  and sometimes she does, like, a little disclaimer for me, but I also...  Do you want to try out some of your material on our show?  I think I've already done some of it.  No, what are you going to do on The View tomorrow?  She's so proud.  Do I have to tell you?  Tune in, Ash.  Tune in, I'm not trying anything out.  If I do anything new...  We don't have a big crossover audience with The View, so if you say it here, it'll still be new to people tomorrow on The View. 
[02:28:00]  Well, now that you know, I'll tell you.  Give us one thing.  I already did a bunch of it.  I did the Christmas stuff on it.  That's what I'm going to do.  That's funny stuff, right?  That'll kill tomorrow, yeah.  And I'm going to do my...  And that's when they'll go, like, oh, my God, turn my friggin' monitors down.  When he was in big...  Do you know what that song is?  Blues in the Night, by Johnny Mercer and Harold Arlen.  Oh, of course.  Yeah.  But the ending is...  Who what?  He lives in a cave and doesn't behave.  We sing blues in the night. 
[02:28:30]  Hey, that's my list.  Kevin, what's up?  The girls will love it.  Yeah, and check out the Kevin Meaney website.  There's a drunk, A-looking Kevin Meaney on his webcam right now.  Now I've got to go real quick.  Yeah, go right now.  Kevin Meaney was in here a while ago, and he was telling us about this really lame website  he has.  So we check it out every once in a while, and he has a live cam that's usually just focused  on a cabinet.  But now Kevin is telling us that Kevin Meaney is drunk on his cam right now.  He just looks wasted right now.  Ah, see, yeah, I don't know how to spell Meaney. 
[02:29:00]  His last name...  M-E-A.  It's, uh...  M-E-A.  M-E-A.  Too late.  M-E-A.  N-E-Y.  N-E-Y.  What?  M-E-A-N-E-Y.  Hurry up, man.  The delay's going to kick in, and everyone else is going to be...  N-E-Y, what's your name?  It's too late.  I...  Ah, your mother...  It's too late.  Watch.  It's too late.  It's just going to slam it down.  Oh, here it is.  What is it?  A drunk cam?  What is that?  Well, where is that?  Yeah, it's M-E-A-N-Y.  Yeah, I got it.  That's Kevin Meaney.  Yeah. 
[02:29:30]  I'm trying...  Oh, media, I guess?  Live KevCam.  Live KevCam?  Oh, my God.  All right.  What about the live Liza cam?  What is that?  Wait, turn it around.  Let me see.  Let me see a drunk Kevin Meaney.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Is that really him?  Yeah, that's Kevin.  Live right now?  That's hilarious.  Is he live right now?  Yeah, that is no way that would be him live.  Is he just answering his email or something?  It must be a still picture.  It is still.  All right, later, guys.  It has the date and time, but it's just him with his hair all messed up. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, my God.  You think it's just a still that he leaves up there when he's not on?  Yeah, which is kind of very funny.  Hey, Anthony, I've got to break into the show here.  Day Late Guy wants to check in.  Day Late Guy on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, one of our newer characters on the Opie and Anthony Show.  He's trying to come up with new characters.  Day Late Guy, Matt, what's going on?  Hey, guys, I'm down at Roosevelt Field for the homeless shopping.  Where the hell are you?  No, Day Late Guy, that was yesterday.  Yesterday?  No, no, I'm there today.  Where are you guys?  Uh-oh, I think you might be a Day Late. 
[02:30:30]  No, I don't think, no, really.  Why am I, I'm here for nothing then.  Matt, you're always a Day Late.  I don't get it.  That really sucks.  All right, Matt.  I'm sitting in front of Whitman's waiting for you, bastards, and you're not here.  He's in front of Whitman's?  I'm sorry, Day Late Guy.  Tell me about the candy.  You're at Day Late.  I'll have to check in with you guys another time.  I'll catch up with you.  All right, there he goes.  Bye, Day Late Guy.  There'll be an exciting new character on our program. 
[02:31:00]  It's Day Late Guy.  That burns a hole to the screen.  That's right, three to the New York Observer.  You're now doing the view tomorrow.  All right, have you heard that Star Jones has got a deal?  She is endorsing Payless Shoes.  Why?  This woman, how much money do you think Star Jones pulls in?  I have no idea.  I noticed a lot, because she liked them beauty products.  She's also on that NBC thing, too.  Yeah, she's all over the place.  And now she's Payless Shoes. 
[02:31:30]  Well, that doesn't seem to me to be some of the...  So what?  I've got to deal with Favre.  Aren't they still in business?  Favre.  Favre and me, we've got a big deal going on.  You know what?  There are some things you shouldn't ever do on your show, because it will just stick in  everyone's head.  I was watching the view one morning, yes?  When I was in the hell that I call marriage.  And I had to sit there and watch that crap.  And Star Jones was demonstrating how to get wax out of your ears.  This is serious.  Was it that light in that candle thing?  Thank you.  I know what that is.  She had what amounts to a straw. 
[02:32:00]  To the straw.  It's a straw.  She put it in her ear, in her ear, not her ear.  And you'll light the top, right?  And light the top like a candle.  So she's laying there.  This flaming straw is in her ear.  And you're like, what could this possibly be doing?  It's like a foot long.  In her ear.  Burning it in her ear.  Yeah, in her ear.  Her ear.  And it's supposedly just all the wax out.  And you open it up and there's all this crap on the bottom.  What it does, it's amazing physics.  As the flame burns the oxygen in the tube, it creates a vacuum, which pulls the wax into the tube. 
[02:32:30]  She let it burn down until it was about, I don't know, sticking an inch or two out of her ear.  Her ear.  So it pulls the wax out of her ear.  And she, yeah, she takes this couple of inch long segment of tube that's left.  They cut it open.  And you see about an inch or an inch and a half of this goopy brown wax that came out of Star Jones.  Calm down there, no.  That came out of her ear.  That came out of Star Jones.  I have a confession to make.  I did this once.  Did you do it on television? 
[02:33:00]  No, I did not.  All right.  I did it in a hotel room with my friend Kim.  And my friend Kim Sia, and she lit the thing.  But I heard it was a hoax.  I heard the stuff's already in there.  Like you open it up and it's like fake wax.  Oh, really?  It's a hoax.  But did you do it?  Yeah, I did.  Did it work?  It opened up and you see this junk on the bottom, but I think it's a hoax.  You can't look through it before you put it in your ear?  It's kind of cloudy.  I'd like to open it up first in front of you.  All right.  Well, good.  We'll get to the bottom of that. 
[02:33:30]  We'll do it on this show, maybe.  I think we should do it one another.  Are we still talking about ears or Steam Pipe Alley?  No, we're talking about Steam Pipe Alley.  Sweet.  You're sticking up your Steam Pipe Alley.  Yeah, I'm sticking up your Steam Pipe Alley.  But any time I see Star Jones now, all I think of is this goopy, earwaxy, ugh, disgusting.  Who is Star Jones?  Imagine that to me.  She's on The View.  God, do you watch TV?  No.  What do you do?  No, I don't.  You don't play video games.  You don't watch television.  I don't know what you do.  What do you do for fun?  Besides rape.  I do. 
[02:34:00]  Forcible rape.  Yes, that's it.  Can I interrupt with instant feedback from Donna?  Yeah.  From Dover?  Dover, Massachusetts.  Dover, Maine?  What?  Dover what?  It should be Dover, Maine.  Mario, have I got the guy for you.  Oh, God.  Ready for this?  I'm married.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Are you married?  Yeah, I've been married for 10 years.  Go ahead.  I don't get that married thing.  I'm not married legally.  We think I'm an idiot.  We've got to talk about that.  Let me tell you something.  I'll tell you something.  Married, married?  Commitment thing? 
[02:34:30]  10 years.  Forever?  Forever?  Ever?  10 years.  10 years.  10 years.  10 years.  Yeah, 10 years.  I thought that's the one good thing about being gay.  You could be free forever.  You can be free forever.  You know what?  You guys actually commit and stuff.  10 years I've been with somebody else.  You're gay?  Go ahead.  10 years.  Jim.  Yes, Jim.  Hello.  No, I'm really lying so I can get chicks.  At least he admits it to you.  It works.  Yeah, Jim.  The girls love me.  The girls love me.  I know.  I love women. 
[02:35:00]  The girls love Mario.  Hey, I make out with the chicks.  Go ahead.  I love the chicks.  You make out with them.  I do.  I made out with them.  For a goof.  For a goof.  Oh.  For a goof.  Oh.  What did you say?  Have I got the guy for you?  Well, I've got to interrupt, though, because overreacting guy is calling in.  Another new character on the O.P. and Anthony show.  You've got to finish the E show.  Overreacting guy.  Mario is there.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe he's there.  Hi, overreacting guy.  Are you going to be on the view tomorrow?  Yeah, I'm going to pull back just for you.  Yes, go ahead.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe it. 
[02:35:30]  And then yesterday there were cops everywhere, and there was helicopters, and I can't believe  that the D-Late guy was there today.  What?  They're overreacting guy.  Overreacting guy.  Oh, my God.  I just can't believe it.  Calm down.  I think you're overreacting.  You're overreacting now.  Calm down.  It's only the view.  Well, we enjoy when overreacting guy calls himself.  Has he ever called?  I don't know.  Oh, sure, yeah.  I want you to read with you.  So, have I got a guy for you?  This is great, though.  Donna from Dover.  Mario, have I got the guy for you?  Ready for this?  Yeah.  My son. 
[02:36:00]  All right.  She's out of her mind.  He is 19.  No, that's ridiculous.  Is this for real?  Come on.  If this is for real, she's got to send another instant feedback.  If that's for real, she's an inept mother.  Mario, have I got the guy for you?  My son.  He's 19.  This may sound strange to you, a mother trying to hook her son up with another guy, but I  love my son.  I will send pick if you want to see my great-looking Italian son.  I'm sure he's you.  Thank you.  Donna.  Donna, I'm 95.  Okay? 
[02:36:30]  I'm 93 years old last week.  You look like a young gay man.  I'm a young old hooker.  You don't like the young guy?  I'm a laugh whore.  I'm a jester.  I'm a laugh whore.  Mario, I think you're making a mistake.  I think she should send a picture of her son's mule to Tinkle Drinker at AOL.com.  And I think you should look at it.  That's Norton's website.  Hey, John, what's up? 
[02:37:00]  Well, that is brutal.  John.  Yeah.  What's up?  Go ahead real fast.  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  Oh, good.  Help us, John.  John, what's the matter?  Go ahead, John.  Are you being don't know you're on the air guy?  Yeah, I don't know I'm on the air guy.  No, we already have don't know I'm on the air guy.  Oh, you already got it.  Who, who, who?  Don't rip off that guy.  I missed the day late guy, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  He has nothing. 
[02:37:30]  He actually said he had a tape of Barbara Walters.  I've heard about this.  There's supposed to be either pictures or something of Barbara Walters having sex with the president.  No, sir.  With JFK or something.  I don't know.  I heard.  I've seen naked pictures of Barbara.  Have you seen that?  Never.  Topless pictures of Barbara Walters?  Oh, yeah.  No.  Really?  Really?  Yeah.  They're really bad.  They're old, though.  They're like.  Yeah, they're black and white.  She's, you know, somewhere in the 70s.  Back in the old days when, you know, how do you think any of those women made it to where 
[02:38:00]  they are?  Stop it.  Maybe that's actually a little speech impediment.  It was very hard for a woman to do anything without sucking on a mule.  She's been like a news journalist for years.  I don't think she, did she really post-top?  I've seen pictures of her.  I think she needs to.  Oh.  She needs to do the vagina monologues.  That's a good idea.  Do you think the vagina monologues?  My vagina has interviewed the great and the near great.  I think she'd be good.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  American Tone in studio.  He's playing Caroline Sunday, Monday, Anthony. 
[02:38:30]  A lot of people are requesting the holiday message from our own Ken Stevens.  Oh, yes.  This is our general manager.  Yes.  In charge of the opium anthem.  Well, he thinks he's in charge.  It's kind of funny.  But we know who's in charge.  That old gag.  But, yeah, he's the GM of this radio station and many radio stations in the company.  And he sent a holiday message to us and our fans.  I can't wait to hear it.  And now, a holiday message from Oakley and Anthony Joe General Manager Ken Stevens.  I don't care no more. 
[02:39:00]  Okay?  My life is over.  I will kill everyone.  I'll take your gun and shoot you in the head and shoot all these motherfuckers.  And now I'll shoot myself.  I guess I'll get some cool stuff.  I'm trying to take a nap.  You know, f***ing go.  Happy holidays from all of us at the Opie and Anthony Joe.  Heartwarming, right?  Yeah.  That is touching and beautiful.  This is Christmas.  Oh, it is Christmas. 
[02:39:30]  We will play What Do We Learn next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  I've learned nothing.  Hey, it's time for commercials.  I love them.  There's a car with a wow next to me.  Whip out your cans.  Pull out your fun bags.  What are you waiting for?  Do it.  Do it now.  What's the wowing?  You look fabulous.  Opie and Anthony.  We love seeing boobs.  Well done.  Anthony, Sam Adams beer.  Look who's behind you.  Thank you, Lisa.  Lisa, say something about Sam Adams. 
[02:40:00]  Sam Adams.  What do you think about Sam?  Eh, talk.  Just talk.  Say something.  So our listeners can mock you.  Go ahead.  That's not my client.  I can't say anything.  I can't say anything.  And that was her trying not to have a bad voice.  Not to sound like Lisa.  Lisa, if I hit you with a bottle of Sam, will you show me her cheeks?  How cute is Lisa?  She's all toned and ripped.  You like Lisa, huh?  Yeah, she's a pretty girl.  Yeah, she's one of those girls.  Thank God her voice doesn't matter.  Body.  Do me. 
[02:40:30]  Do me.  Don't you like my voice anymore?  I'm crying out loud.  Sell my products.  Sam Adams.  Sam Adams is wonderful.  It's a great beer and you should drink it from a holiday.  Happy holidays, everybody.  Leave everyone a nice cold case of Sam Adams under my tray.  Quack, quack, act, act, act, act, act, act, act, act.  The mocking of Lisa, the sales girl, sponsored by Sam Adams. 
[02:41:00]  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Anthony, it's time to play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show?  But before we do, one of our favorite new characters on the line, Anthony.  Oh, really?  Yes, turn down the radio guy's calling back in.  Oh, I love turn down the radio guy.  Hey, turn down the radio guy.  Hey, turn down the radio guy.  Yeah.  Turn down the radio guy.  You there?  Dude.  Hey, turn down your radio. 
[02:41:30]  Hey, dude, turn down your radio guy.  We can't hear you.  You're live on the air with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, turn down the radio guy.  What a long time.  Hey, turn down the radio.  Turn down the radio guy.  Hey, is he talking in the background?  Because he won't turn his radio down.  Turn down the freaking radio.  Turn down the radio guy.  I don't think the guy knows that he's on the air.  Hey, turn down the radio guy.  Turn down your radio. 
[02:42:00]  Okay, hold on.  I got a good one, okay?  Hello?  All right, well, there you have it.  Turn down the radio guy.  Turn down the radio guy.  We love turn down the radio guy.  I love him.  What a nice guy.  It's frustrating, though.  He never knows when to turn down the radio.  He really needs to turn down the radio.  Darn him.  Rob from Rockland Rice.  Today I learned it's B today.  Yes, that was true.  I also learned letting a psycho mark guard alcoholics is like letting a vampire guard a blood bank. 
[02:42:30]  Love of artichokes is law in Italy.  Hispanics like to bang.  Frosty and Norton have something in common.  And finally, two numbers in a spot.  Never good.  Sheeplover writes, I learned today Christmas is for the beautiful people, Anthony.  Ben from PA.  I learned that other DJs try to sound like Alan Alda on MASH.  That's great.  I don't get that one after you.  Big J writes, I learned Norton is quitting as a comic and becoming a limo driver for Maury Povich. 
[02:43:00]  Let's go to Dave.  Dave, what did you learn on the show today?  We only have like a minute left here.  Dave?  What's up, Dave?  Oh, I learned Anthony turns Norton on.  Uh-huh.  And I learned fat woman should be gutted.  Very good.  Thank you.  Let's go to Joe.  Joe, what did you learn on the show today?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I learned our homeless have new cologne.  The homeless in GTA have Molotov cocktails.  Yeah.  And dead comics, always topical.  Yeah. 
[02:43:30]  Are these people listening to the same show as us, Anthony?  I know.  A couple of things coming in.  Well, sure.  Mario, thanks for stopping by.  I learned today that you boys are the true spirit of Christmas.  And you know what?  Yeah.  Discipline mixed with love is the best Christmas recipe.  Towards the night before Christmas, kiss my big ass.  I love that one.  All right.  Listen, we got to go.  So, Mario, he's going to be on The View tomorrow morning.  All right, guys.  Yes.
