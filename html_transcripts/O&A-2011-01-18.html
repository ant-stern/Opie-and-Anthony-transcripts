<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a profane and humorous introduction by Stacy Keach, followed by a discussion of Keach's show, "Lights Out."  The hosts then launched into a highly profane rant about the Jets-Patriots game, filled with insults directed at Tom Brady and praise for the Jets and Rex Ryan.  Numerous listener calls, including from "Sonny" (a Patriots fan) and "Mark" (a Steelers fan), fueled further crude and opinionated sports talk.  The hosts criticized the perceived overly sensitive reactions of sportscasters to the Jets' victory celebrations, labeling them as "faggoty," and decried the lack of authenticity and political correctness in modern sports.  They played a clip of Bart Scott's post-game interview, praising its aggressive trash-talking.

The conversation took a bizarre turn with a vulgar description of a picture of Brett Favre's penis.  This was followed by anecdotes from their successful Atlantic City live show, including large slot machine wins at the Borgata and humorous stories about Opie's child and Ed's gambling losses and interactions with casino dealers, all punctuated with offensive remarks.

The show then shifted to a comedic dissection of the 2010 Golden Globes, focusing heavily on Ricky Gervais's hosting.  Opie and Anthony, along with callers, provided running commentary on Gervais's jokes targeting Scarlett Johansson (using crude language), Bruce Willis, and Robert Downey Jr.  They discussed reactions from Christian Bale, Al Pacino, Jim Parsons, Heather Morris, and Steve Carell (who was heavily criticized).  The segment featured extensive clips of Gervais's monologue and interactions, including an exchange with Robert De Niro.  A significant portion was dedicated to criticizing Steve Carell's career.  Brief mentions were made of Gabby Giffords's recovery, Zsa Zsa Gabor's amputation, a 17-year-old Miss America winner, Mark Messier and Wayne Gretzky's upcoming 50th birthdays, Steve Jobs's medical leave, and Apple's stock price compared to Microsoft's.  The segment included a re-edited *True Romance* scene replacing a swear word with "slave."

The show then transitioned to a discussion about the poor quality of 80s metal music videos, featuring commentary on various bands like Dio, Ozzy Osbourne, Journey, Queensryche, Blue Oyster Cult, and Twisted Sister, with a humorous dissection of a Candlemas video.  This segued into a discussion of the censorship of the Dire Straits song "Money for Nothing," comparing the CBC's actions to the FCC's, and analyzing the lyric's intent.  The hosts also discussed MTV VJs and censorship in Canada.

The show concluded with a lengthy, highly vulgar description of a penis pump infomercial, including commentary on the actors and a "cock pump party" video, followed by a caller's comment on an earlier joke.  Further discussion of *American Idol*, *Bridalplasty*, and *Heavy* ensued.

A subsequent segment heavily featured EROC's struggles with the South Beach Diet, including graphic descriptions of his food consumption and diet failures.  Roland also admitted to dietary failings.  The hosts joked about a "fatty pig fatty" contest.  A comedic video of a PhD-holding man instructing on self-anal massage was played and discussed.  The show then returned to sports, with guest Jay Mohr joining the hosts for profane commentary on the Jets, Rex Ryan, and other NFL teams.  Jay Mohr impersonated Regis Philbin, and Opie mentioned throwing his Islanders tickets into the East River.  The conversation touched upon underperforming Canadian NHL teams and questionable Jets coaching decisions.  The segment concluded with promotion of Jay Mohr's stand-up shows, anecdotes about Buddy Hackett, a Jägermeister giveaway, discussion of a New Jersey police officer’s death, and promotion of the Opie and Anthony Facebook page.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  Here we go. Here's the bit.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, a father.  I would love to say we have the best job in America.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  It could be the best thing ever.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  Out loud laughs.  How do we explain the show?  We should start there.  Oh, here it is.  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for the cream style of entertainment 
[00:00:30]  and having very few limits.  Oh, shit. This is a freak show.  Why would anybody want to come on this show as a guest?  Under the right circumstances, something weird could happen.  I don't give a fuck.  Laugh out loud funny.  Which I love. That's what I love.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  Because when you listen to our show, you know what you get.  You know what we are.  Everything has to do with cock or balls.  No, the jokes all end up talking about cock and balls. 
[00:01:00]  You're a waste of life.  Fucking listeners, go fucking die.  Excuse me.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Wow.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  How the hell do we follow that?  Holy crap.  Who got Stacy Keach to do that?  That's awesome.  I want to listen to that show.  Yeah, exactly.  That show sounds awesome. 
[00:01:30]  Where is it?  Let's get the hell out of here so we can listen to those guys.  Because the mediocrity about to be delivered is not going to...  Can't live up to the intro.  No.  That's bad.  I think we finally made it.  Stacy Keach doing the intro to the radio show?  That's not bad.  What a great ballsy voice he's got, man.  I didn't realize his voice was so good.  Yeah.  He had a couple other little tidbits, didn't he?  I heard a couple of things, yeah.  What, he's got some outtakes?  Yeah, we have some other clips.  Oh, we got other stuff we'll do? 
[00:02:00]  A little other production.  That's pretty funny.  Okay, cool.  All right, well, more than...  Stacy Keach.  His show, by the way, I watched all five episodes, and I'm fucking so annoyed that I don't have  the other ones.  It's so good.  Do you have to wait for the other ones now?  I don't know.  Roland, we get the DVDs to preview stuff.  It's called Lights Out on FX.  Yeah.  It's great.  It's like, I watched three, and then the last two I watched, and I'm like, God damn it,  why don't I have the whole season?  You don't care, though.  It's great.  He's an old salt.  That FX has it down.  He's already moved on to his next project. 
[00:02:30]  He don't care.  He don't care if you like it or not.  No, he'd like to probably get picked up for season two, though.  Yeah, that's true.  That's a fantastic show.  Hey, he's a huge Jets fan, too, so I want to congratulate Stacy Keach.  Your team did it.  My God.  Beat the fucking Pats.  Right up until the end, though.  You weren't a little like, the wheels seemed to be falling off a little bit.  A little bit.  It was getting a little shaky near the end there.  I was more frightened at the first onside kick than I was after the Pats' last touchdown. 
[00:03:00]  Really?  Yeah, because that was like, all right, they still got time to get the onside kick.  Once the Jets had it, then it was like, okay.  But then it got scary again after they scored and went for the onside kick again.  Right.  Because now you're like, all right.  Here we go.  Let me get a good run on this.  It's over, Johnny, or at least Ty.  But that was, it was an exciting end.  Something was going on.  It sure was.  I was a little distracted because I was going back and forth with Bob Kelly because he's  a big Patriots fan.  Ah, yes.  I must have wrote 20 to 30 text messages to Bob Kelly, and so I think I started missing 
[00:03:30]  some of the game.  Just to razz him?  Was he being razzed?  Well, he wanted to bet me dinner on the game, and by halftime.  It cost you a lot if you won.  Well, yeah.  By halftime, he's like, my wife's not going to go to dinner so I could save some money.  He gave up at halftime.  I got it in the text messages.  Hardcore Pats fan giving up at halftime. 
[00:04:00]  So.  I didn't like the onside kick they went for.  I thought that was a panic move.  Like, they were probably aware of the Jets' run game with two minutes left.  And I'm like, why are they going for, they were down by eight at that point.  Yeah, they're questioning that call now.  That was a dumb call.  They're doing a little Monday morning quarterbacking on that one.  They should be.  That was a dumb one.  You got to just kick it off and try to get them to go three.  And I know one first down would end of the game, but there was almost two minutes left.  Well, I thought Brady looked shaky the entire game.  He looked a little lost out there.  Yeah.  A little lost.  It's always fun watching him get his ass slammed into the ground. 
[00:04:30]  Not a fan of Brady?  No, it's just, you know, it's one of those, he's one of those quarterbacks that the goddamn  guy just seems to have hours back there to pick and choose where he's thrown.  I mean.  A lot of protection.  It's amazing.  So to see him get knocked on his ass every so often is kind of fun.  Well, I mean, the Pats fans, they got back at the Jets.  They beat the crap out of Rex Ryan on the way out of the stadium.  So just pelted with everything. 
[00:05:00]  They're saying soda and ice and whatever else they had in their pockets up there in Foxborough.  Let's say hi to Sonny in Boston.  Is this Forelli?  Yeah, it's fucking Sonny.  Oh, shit.  Fucking green.  Motherfucking.  Wow.  You're fucking doing a little fucking airplane.  Fucking dance in the fucking end zone.  Wait, wait, wait.  I think we better clear something up first.  Sonny, you're a Pats fan.  I think so.  Hey, listen, man.  No one wanted to listen to my dumb sports talk because it sounds lame when you listen 
[00:05:30]  to it.  But, man, it's very logical.  I'm telling you right now.  Rex Ryan told his team to get the shit kicked out of him.  And that's exactly what the Pats did 45 to 3 to set up this fine victory this past Sunday.  That is, uh...  I'm telling you.  I'm telling you.  You were saying that.  You were saying that.  And I'm saying, God damn it, that's the way I would fucking think.  But I'm saying, no, fucking Opie fucking shit.  Lol.  Why are we talking to Pats fans?  It's all about Pittsburgh now. 
[00:06:00]  Lol.  I want to hear from the Steelers fans.  Not the Pats.  That's like looking in the rearview mirror, man.  Old news.  Old hat.  Pittsburgh, I gotta bury the Jets.  It's gonna be a good game Sunday.  Well, they did say that it was supposed to be a complete blowout with the Pats.  So we'll see what happens.  But you know what they do have, though?  The terrible towel.  That's right.  That's right.  You know how I love a stadium full of people with props.  Well, they got the terrible towels and we got the rape whistles. 
[00:06:30]  So we're all safe for the big game.  The big game.  I fucked you guys.  Hey, you know what?  You guys should be proud, though.  You had a really good season.  Good season.  Good season for you guys.  Next year.  There's always next year.  What was your record this year, Sonny?  I think it was something like, what was it, 14-2?  So 14-2.  And then there was the year that the Pats went 16-0.  Yeah, that one.  Yeah, yeah.  So in two seasons, they went 30-2 without a Super Bowl.  That's pretty impressive.  I bet.  This was like one of the youngest teams of the league, too. 
[00:07:00]  So, I mean...  All right, yeah, good.  Listen, here's the thing.  I got tired of these baby announcers complaining about the Jets celebrating.  They're like, oh, you know, what is that?  Like, the announcers are such faggots.  What faggots the announcers are.  Yeah.  The Jets haven't won shit in a long time.  Yeah, let them celebrate.  Yeah, really.  Yeah, that's right.  All right.  You know, in all honesty, congratulations to the Jets, man.  They outplayed us.  What can I say?  And, Sonny, while you're on the phone, because you're from the Boston area, I want to say  hi to Willie O'Ree today. 
[00:07:30]  Willie O'Ree?  Willie O'Ree.  Yeah.  Good old Willie O'Ree.  Willie O'Ree.  Do you know who Willie O'Ree is, Sonny?  No, I have no fucking clue.  Who the fuck is he?  Oh, boy.  He was the first.  Better hang up on him before you tell him.  He's in a mood.  Well, that's why I want to tell Sonny.  We got a raw nerve on the phone.  Willie O'Ree was the first black NHL player.  Oh.  And he debuted for the Boston Bruins 53 years ago. 
[00:08:00]  For the Bruins?  Why the hell would they put the first black NHL player up there in Boston?  What the fuck is a black man?  See, that's why I had to do it to Sonny.  On this day after Martin Luther King Day.  Right.  All right, Sonny.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Bye.  You know what?  We have to play good old Wes Walker.  Wes Walker.  Wow.  Wes Walker fucked everything up for the Pats.  Pissing off Bill Belichick. 
[00:08:30]  So, I think he sat him for the kickoff or something.  Yeah.  He showed him.  Showed him.  He showed him.  You're going to sit down for a play for what you said before the game.  In a press conference, this is what he said before the Jets-Pats game.  Or the Pats-Jets game.  Or however the hell you want to say.  I mean, the guy is, he is who he is.  And he does a great job of making sure everybody's on the same page.  And everybody's putting their best foot forward.  You can't just stick your toe in the water.  Especially, you know, you got your foot up in the air.  Wanting to go out there and just put your best foot forward. 
[00:09:00]  He's got great feet.  You know, he has good feet.  He's another guy who has great feet.  You want to make sure that, you know, you bring your best foot forward out there.  So, let's go out there and being good little foot soldiers.  You definitely have to be on your toes and make sure that you're ready to go.  Now, the big question.  I'm a Jets fan and that's a Pats player, Wes Walker.  He should absolutely be able to do that.  Of course, it's hilarious.  Hell yes.  Bill Belichick said, whoa, what the fuck are you doing?  And kind of, you know, sat him for, I don't know how many plays.  It said your wife then.  She's the one letting guys suck on her toes. 
[00:09:30]  Wait, that was Belichick.  Ryan, the one.  Belichick's a Pats player.  No, no, no.  That's a Pats player.  Pats player?  Yeah.  You're saying that it was his wife's toes.  No, no.  No, I mean, it's like, why would that upset anybody?  Right.  Because it's Ryan's wife that's got the frigging shit out there.  Because sports is filled with a bunch of crybabies.  Yeah.  And it's not the players, by the way.  It's everyone else revolved around the players.  Wes Walker should be able to do that. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, it's funny.  In a press conference leading up to the big game.  Unbelievable.  Why not?  Come on.  But there was all sorts of outrage and blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, what do you got on this?  Travis.  Well, Belichick, like, specifically told his players, don't get involved in this Jets back  and forth shit.  So, Welker kind of went against what Belichick said.  He went against what Belichick said.  So, Belichick had to make an example of him.  He benched him for the first set.  For the first.  Oh, that shows a lot.  And then he let him play.  But then the Boston Herald turns around after the loss in the front page of the paper. 
[00:10:30]  Sure, Rex's Jets walk all over Patriots.  Agony of defeat.  Feet spelled F-E-E-T.  And then in big letters, stomped.  Stomped, which you do with, you know, feet.  Sure.  It's the obvious thing that everyone's talking about.  Yeah.  Rex Ryan and his love of feet.  And his love of black men sucking on his wife's toes.  Hey, man, whatever he needs to do to get this fucking Super Bowl back in New York. 
[00:11:00]  I don't give a fuck, man.  Well, at least more videos, please.  Black guys sucking on your wife's feet.  If that gets a win in the column there, fine.  You can only imagine what Rex Ryan was doing after that big victory.  Oh, God.  The whole team's coming back to my house.  Damn.  So, I thought that was hilarious.  I love that shit in sports.  Yeah.  I love the trash talking.  I love the celebrations on the field.  But for some reason, we're not supposed to show emotions. 
[00:11:30]  They're just, they've turned into fucking fags.  They really have.  Everybody.  I hate sports announcers.  I hate sports announcers.  And you should hate award shows, too.  We're going to get into that.  Yeah.  It's the same shit going on in pop culture in general.  Babies.  People are just very selective about what they want made fun of or what they find acceptable.  It really is annoying how they, people want to be able to skewer what they want and what  they don't agree with.  Yeah.  But if you skewer them, they fucking snivel. 
[00:12:00]  Like sportsmanship.  I don't want sportsmanship.  I want my team trash talking right up to the point they lose or win.  I don't give a fuck.  The more the better, too.  And isn't psyching out, hasn't that been part of the game?  Like every sport?  Used to be.  Forever.  Is psyching out the other team taking something that you hope throws them off balance a little  bit?  Used to be.  Yeah.  Half these guys, if they weren't in the NFL, they would be committing crime somewhere.  But we got to make believe they're good citizens and have to act accordingly. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  Fuck that crap.  Trash talk.  Fucking dance your ass off in the end zone if you have to.  Just looking at the lovely Mrs. Ryan pictures.  I see that.  Jesus.  Pull out a Sharpie and sign a fucking football after you score.  I love all that shit.  Love it.  Not anymore.  The athletes are dicks, too.  We've had enough of them in here.  They're fucking too cool for the room jagoffs.  Most of them.  Some of them are really cool, but a lot of them are just dicks. 
[00:13:00]  Not like the old days when they weren't getting paid what they should have.  And then after the game, the Jets Bart Scott cuts a promo after the game.  Listen to this.  This is terrific as well.  So all the non-believers.  How did that?  So all the non-believers.  Especially you, Tom Jackson.  Way to have our back, Keyshawn.  Anybody can be beat.  So how did that just feel? 
[00:13:30]  It felt great.  Poetic justice.  We know we were a much better team than we came up and represented ourselves.  We were pissed off.  We were just ready to come back and show us what type of defense, what type of team this  was, what kind of character we had.  We took a lot of slack.  People gave us no chance.  It's like we barely made it in playoffs.  We're a good football team.  It looks like this team played with anger all day.  Why, bud?  For all you non-believers.  Disrespect us.  Talk crap about the defense. 
[00:14:00]  And we're the third best defense in the league.  All we hear is about their defense.  They can't stop a nosebleed.  Wow.  25th in the league.  They can't stop a nosebleed.  We didn't want to get disrespected.  Congratulations.  See you in Pittsburgh.  Can't wait.  That was the scariest interview I've ever heard in my life.  And that shit rules.  Whether it's your team or the other team, I don't give a fuck.  That shit rules.  It gives me that Super Bowl ring.  Exactly.  Yeah.  You know what it is?  It gives me that. 
[00:14:30]  They like to pretend a lot of these guys aren't from where they're from.  That's what the league wants to do.  Yeah.  The league is trying to go, hey, we know where you're from and what your upbringing was,  but let's pretend you're not that.  Like, that's the way you shit talk when you're playing.  You know what I mean?  It's like, and it's phony.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When LeBron James.  It was great.  When LeBron James went back to Cleveland, he was giving everybody shit.  And I'm sitting there.  I'm not a big LeBron James fan, but I was loving it as a sports fan.  I was loving the fact that he's like kind of walking over toward the bench when,  you know, someone was taking foul shots and just giving him a few fucking jabs. 
[00:15:00]  I loved all that.  I thought, did you screw up?  Was that a clip from Scared Straight?  Yes.  Yes.  Because I.  The new Scared Straight.  I thought that was the new Scared Straight.  Some new fish was in.  Yeah.  And he was being yelled at.  Let me say hi to Mark in Pittsburgh.  Mark E.  Hey.  What are you guys?  How you doing?  All right, brother.  I hope you want to let you know, you're just, they already won their Super Bowl.  They're on an emotional high and they're going to lose coming to Pittsburgh this week.  Oh, boy.  That was some tough trash talking by you. 
[00:15:30]  Wow, really?  I don't even know what to do with that.  Well, go ahead and try.  I just hope you guys make a lot of feet jokes this week.  Because it worked out well for the Pats.  Rex Ryan doesn't give a fuck if you talk about feet, black guys licking his wife's toes.  He don't care.  He probably gets off listening to other people talk about it.  Yeah, he doesn't give a shit.  So, have fun with that in Pittsburgh all week.  Because it's going to be a big mistake on your part.  All right.  Punch it on your feet.  Leave the feet alone and maybe you got a shot. 
[00:16:00]  I can't wait for Sunday.  The terrible towels.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  You know what?  Really fast.  Sorry.  Ronnie in Jersey.  Ronnie.  What's up, fellas?  How's Sammy's sweetheart?  I just want to know if that's Clubber Lang or Bart Scott.  I did sound like Clubber.  Hey, woman.  Hey, woman.  Once you come over to my house, I'll show you how a real man sucks feet.  What was the other game? 
[00:16:30]  I forgot.  Green Bay.  Oh, yeah.  Green Bay looks fucking tough.  Rogers.  Jesus Christ.  They're playing Chicago.  Who did they beat up, Green Bay?  Atlanta.  Atlanta.  They killed them.  Yeah, they killed Atlanta.  Fuck.  Like, Rogers and the Packers, they're the favorites to win the Super Bowl.  I think Brett Favre says they're going all the way.  Fuck Brett Favre.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  The newly retired.  Yeah, the newly retired.  Did you get some of his merchandise?  He filed his retirement papers, and within minutes, he had retirement shit on his website. 
[00:17:00]  He was whoring stuff on his website.  He did the same thing when he announced that he wasn't going to start that game.  When his streak was over, literally 10 minutes later, there was specialized streak-ended merchandise.  The tiny little dickhead hats here.  He's selling it.  That's embarrassing.  Little teeny penis doilies.  Yeah.  Little wiener doilies.  I despise that fucking attention whore woman-man quarterback.  Nice dickhead, stupid. 
[00:17:30]  Fucking loathe him.  Horrible.  That should be in a trench in Europe in 1914.  It really should be.  Allied forces should be firing at it.  Wrong war.  I was off by 40 years.  There's the little penis.  Oh, God.  But they claim he has huge hands.  Look at how he's holding it.  He's holding it like it's a real mighty weapon with his fucking...  Can you turn that a little so I can look at his fucking...  His horrible fucking...  It looks like his pubes look like... 
[00:18:00]  You ever see the atom bomb go off the way the ground looks?  His fucking pubes suck.  Those are...  What awful pubes.  And look at him trying to make it look turgid as he squeezes it mightily.  He's squeezing it and leaning it off to one side.  It's awful.  His dick is horrible.  A real sexy picture.  His fucking left foot is all curled up on the pillow.  What a douche.  He's holding it like you would hold an old sick relative. 
[00:18:30]  That's what it looks like, yeah.  Just very carefully.  Everybody knows when you're sending a dick picture,  you've got to flex and get all the blood into that dick  and get it as big as possible.  What the fuck is that?  And you point it a certain way.  Or let it hang downward so it looks like there's nothing happening yet.  That's actually a picture you'd send your mom to show off your watch.  And I hate this multicolored dickhead.  I hate the way that the dick just got tired of being one color and switched colors. 
[00:19:00]  Right below that shitty helmet.  It's just got tired.  Isn't it horrible?  That's hysterical.  I'd like to watch a lion lick the skin off that with its rough cat tongue.  Fuck him, attention whore.  His pubes go right into his leg hair.  They're fucking horrid.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, it's all over the place.  Stupid knuckle.  I hate it.  Everything about that picture is horrid if you're sending a dick. 
[00:19:30]  That's what not to do when sending a dick pic.  How about you close the door in the background?  How about you do that?  Is that an open door?  Because now all I'm thinking is, who's coming in?  Who's going out?  And fucking, why don't you make the bed?  He was in such a sexy pose.  His asshole probably stunk.  Fucking jerk.  Fuck him.  Dumb streak.  He's retired now, though.  I know.  Good for him.  Time for more dick pics.  It's finally moving on.  That's all he'll be doing now.  Dick pic.  Dick picking. 
[00:20:00]  Shit.  Good one.  Hey, Jimmy, the AC show was amazing.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  Everybody was fucking great.  You, Bill Burr, Jim Brewer, and David Tal.  Holy shit, what a lineup.  We did something different on the second show.  You guys saw the first show, which was the first time we did it.  And I realized that I wanted somebody in front of me for like five because the Pittsburgh  game had ended and people were kind of coming in.  So the late show was even better because we had a comedian just go up and do five minutes. 
[00:20:30]  And then the Sunday show was fucking phenomenal.  I was happy with all of them.  But that first one, I just wish that I'd had a guy in front of me for five to get people  seated.  I noticed.  It all worked.  I mean, you noticed, but no one else did.  It was an amazing show.  Amazing.  Thank you, man.  Really funny.  And a lot of fun down in Atlantic City.  Man, just met a lot of fucking fans.  Yeah, the Borgata was slammed all weekend.  Oh, yeah, they were.  It was fucking mobbed.  A lot of fans.  And who won the fucking jackpot?  That's what everyone wants to know.  While we were down there, two fucking slot machines hit. 
[00:21:00]  One for $3.5 million.  The penny fucking, did I say stock?  Penny slots.  The penny slot.  The penny slot machine hit for $3.5 million.  The Wheel of Fortune won while the whole crew was down there.  I mean, the odds are one of our fans could have easily won that.  I'm sorry, Mr. Rothstein.  Sometimes people just win.  A two machines hit.  Then another one for $700,000.  Is that the lady that won?  That's not a fan of our show.  No, there's no one identified. 
[00:21:30]  That's a file photo.  Was that a lady that won?  That's not a fan of our show.  Any lady.  Yeah, exactly.  A lot of guys like this radio show.  Wow.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  That's on a penny stock?  Yeah, it's not a stock slot.  I just did the same thing.  Yeah, penny slots.  The first progressive jackpot hit on that type of machine since May of 08.  Yeah, that thing hasn't paid off since 08 like that.  Wow.  What's that?  It hasn't paid off like that since 08? 
[00:22:00]  Oh, since 08, yeah.  I mean, you know, you win here and there, but nothing like $3.5 million.  Holy shit.  It's the only hotel in, honestly, the only hotel in A.C. worth staying in.  I mean, the other ones I haven't been in in a long time, but they were always fucking  kind of run down and shit.  Yeah, that place is class is what it is.  It's class.  Can you imagine putting a penny in a fucking, and then it, then what happens?  Yeah, it's just.  Just all hell breaks loose.  Do pennies start spilling out? 
[00:22:30]  I don't think, yeah, that would suck if you had to pick up three, they have a million  dollars in pennies.  That's the way they should do it, though.  Make a scene.  Why not?  Just have the pennies just keep pouring out until it covers the person.  Ching, ching, ching, ching, ching.  You just act.  What is it?  Just a slip of paper pops out?  Who cares?  I think.  I think the whole machine goes bullshit.  Yeah, I think at that point, nothing happens.  Like, it's just a siren goes off and someone has to come get you.  The whole machine goes crazy.  And then you run away.  Do you think you did something wrong?  Yeah.  And then somebody else steps up.  Don Rickles comes up and goes, let's get some champagne.  Let's make it in the bag. 
[00:23:00]  A lot of money.  The ceiling should open up and pennies should just fall on your head.  And crush you.  Yes.  Why not?  Crushed in your dumb pennies.  But, yeah, it was definitely a good weekend down there.  Yeah, a lot of fun.  We brought the kid, which got a lot of looks.  Yeah, huh?  So I kept saying, you can win anything down here.  Oh, is that the joke?  Like, look, I want a baby.  Yeah, everyone's looking at us in the elevator.  I'm like, yeah, we got really lucky today. 
[00:23:30]  We want a kid.  He he he.  The baby.  Any stories from your weekend, Ed?  No, not really.  Borgata.  Up down?  Well, they could pay off, you know, one of those slot things pretty much from what I left there.  Yeah, it was an ugly weekend.  Yeah, it was an ugly weekend.  It wasn't going well.  You finally got hit?  Yeah, I had my ups and downs. 
[00:24:00]  You've been having a lot of mostly downs.  Your casino experiences lately have been a lot of ups.  I know.  You finally gave back a little bit.  Well, no, lately, though, they've been downs.  Like the past, I think the past three outings have been down after an astonishing run.  But you paid for your suite this weekend.  Oh, you paid for the limo.  You covered a lot of expenses for the wing.  Was it your worst loss? 
[00:24:30]  It was up there.  Wow.  It was up there.  I know the figure I heard at one point, and I actually went like this.  Hi.  Hi.  I actually had my air left me.  No, it was nice.  But you know what?  You go up there.  I watched it for a half hour.  I had to get out of that.  Crazy.  It's intense.  You yell at everybody when you're losing.  Is he yelling?  Not yelling, but you're intense.  Oh, it's like, come on, big!  I thought I was intense.  You're way more intense than me when you're gambling. 
[00:25:00]  Holy shit.  Big!  Holy shit.  Seven!  Talking to yourself, talking to the dealer.  What kind of crap is that?  Talking to anyone that'll sort of make believe they're listening to you,  but they're looking down at their drinks like, please don't hit me.  They were all fans at that table, which was cool.  Yeah, I know.  Like we were able to get another table where...  Where's the slick guy that had a big stack in front of him?  Was he a fan, too, or was he a foreigner?  Yeah, he was a fan.  He just came by and was like...  He wasn't really talking much.  He was concentrating on playing.  Yeah.  It was good. 
[00:25:30]  And then I made it where the dealer had some incentive.  I was like, Blackjack gets you a black chip.  I was like, huh, wow.  So every time the card came around and I got dealt an ace,  I was like, put a color on that and you get 100.  You get 100.  Oh, look, you lose.  Sorry, you didn't get it.  See, so I was being the house.  It worked out well.  That's how you justified it?  It's fun being the house, isn't it? 
[00:26:00]  You're losing now, really?  Yeah, see, now you just lost.  Yeah.  I turned it all around.  You see how that worked?  She left and picked up her paycheck.  Fuck that.  She was pretty.  When I was there, there was a black girl who was your dealer.  She was really cute, very hot.  Why would you let a black girl steal the cards to you?  That's strange.  Well.  You did that in honor of MLK Day.  Yeah, I was reflecting.  Were you?  A lot of reflecting was going on yesterday.  I actually watched Oprah doing a whole reflecting thing on race in the country. 
[00:26:30]  You watched Actually Oprah?  Actually Oprah.  It's a new show.  It's called Actually Oprah.  Do you feel any differently?  Have you watched your own network yet?  No.  They do a reality show behind the scenes at Oprah.  Really?  But they haven't shown Eric Logan yet.  I was going to say, is Elo on it now?  They haven't showed Elo yet, so I'm starting to think he never got that job with Oprah.  He just lied to everybody.  He lied?  He could have.  I have a feeling he's just mixing drinks in the Caribbean somewhere, and he told everyone  he was working for Oprah.  He's sitting out.  I've watched three of the behind the scenes episodes. 
[00:27:00]  I started watching because I'm like, I want to see Elo.  See what he does.  Now I'm sort of hooked on it because it shows you how they put the whole fucking show together.  Yeah.  And you realize it's just like our show and every other fucking show out there.  Remember when Oprah had to do the road trip with Gail?  Yeah.  She claims she's not a lesbian, by the way.  She says it right on her behind the scenes reality show.  Oh, she certainly does.  And they had cameras set up so they could capture Gail and Oprah on the road, right?  Yeah.  And then the cameras, every time they turned the car off, the cameras would go off and 
[00:27:30]  you would have to manually turn them back on.  And they're like, well, Jesus Christ, we can't get anything to work properly.  Oh, see?  So shit's fucking up over there.  And it's Oprah.  She's a billionaire.  Big organization.  And her company can't figure shit out.  Big organization.  Made me feel better about our organization.  They were showing racial moments in history as per the Oprah Winfrey show.  And they showed, because Oprah, I guess, was doing a show when the OJ verdict came through. 
[00:28:00]  And not live, but taping it when the verdicts came through.  Right.  So when they played it later on, they showed the reaction of her audience.  Right.  I remember that.  Completely down racial lines where black people were hooping and hollering like, well, I can't  believe this.  It's great.  I'm glad.  And then white people like, hey, excuse me.  The guy killed people.  And then you're like, ooh, like the black people got mad at the white people.  There was pandemonium in there.  And they got that. 
[00:28:30]  They had the L.A. riots.  Showed the L.A. riots because of the Rodney King thing, which, God, you forget how fucking  out of control that was.  I mean, it was, it wasn't just a store or two burning down.  The people were just getting shot and fires burning.  Asians just being burnt out of Watts.  Over OJ, too.  Well, that was the Rodney King thing.  That was the Rodney King thing.  That was the Rodney King thing.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Correct.  And then one of the white people during the OJ show said if they didn't acquit him, she 
[00:29:00]  goes, the blacks would have started burning L.A. down again.  And that's when a lot of the people in the audience went, oh, no, no, no.  And it's like, what?  And the woman's standing there like, well, what happened a couple of years ago with the  fucking Rodney King thing?  So, but then, you know, Oprah's there and there was some Martin Luther King quote behind  her and everything was fine. 
[00:29:30]  Well, let me tell you something about Oprah.  Yeah.  If you watch The Own Network, I know I sound like a complete faggot, but I'm telling you,  it's not that bad.  She has all white people working for her.  Yeah.  You would think someone like Oprah would have nothing but a black staff.  Oh, really?  I saw nothing but white people in all the big positions, too.  Jeez, what does Own stand for?  Opie watches.  Oh.  Yeah.  That's a good one. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, jeez.  That's a good one.  They just did a racial poll in New York and white New Yorkers think race and race have  gotten better and black New Yorkers.  I'm telling you this.  Black people are more honest when it comes to their feelings about it.  I'm not saying they're more right.  But they're more honest about being annoyed about race or about having racial feelings.  You're honest.  I'm honest. 
[00:30:30]  I think on this show we are.  But most people pretend they don't have any racial feelings and they don't notice race.  Black people don't pretend that.  They talk about it.  Even when they're wrong, they talk about what they're annoyed about.  Even if they're blaming somebody, whatever they're doing, at least they're addressing it.  I don't think it's more a trait or some kind of innate honesty.  I think like the N-word, they're allowed to be more honest because they won't be called 
[00:31:00]  out as quickly as a white person would be if they were honest.  Maybe, but I don't think that's why they do it.  I think that either way, because long before that was true, they said it.  I think they're more honest about race relations.  They're not afraid of appearing impolite.  Do you think they're better or worse?  Obviously, they're a lot better.  I think they're a lot better.  They're a lot better.  Oh, they're way better.  They're a lot better.  Way better.  I got to move backwards.  I think Sandra in Vegas works at a casino, I do believe, and she's not happy about the 
[00:31:30]  stories you tell about how you deal with the dealers.  Oh, really?  All righty.  Let's hear it.  Sandra in Vegas, what's up?  Hey, I just really wanted to quickly say anything.  He doesn't have to respond, but...  Oh, I will.  Just stay on the line.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Because you're a little excited.  Where do you work in Vegas and what do you do?  Just so we have a feel for this woman here.  I work in table games.  I'm not going to tell you the casino.  It's a very, very nice casino. 
[00:32:00]  Okay.  But it's lovely.  I've been a dealer, and now I'm a pit supervisor.  But yeah.  Congratulations.  Every, every...  Would you suck off for that job?  No, no, no.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  I'm not going to take it personally.  Yeah.  You are definitely...  Every story I hear from...  And I can't help but listen to your show and you get cracking up.  But every time you talk about gambling, I'm like, that's the cock that I  want to punch at the table every time.  Oh, good.  I'm actually doing my job then. 
[00:32:30]  You are.  Because you dealers are the cocks I want to punch when I'm sitting at the  table.  Well, you know, I understand.  I'm not a dealer, and I understand that feeling.  I just wanted to let you know.  Let me tell you something.  I take care of all you workers.  I'm a tipping machine.  Well, and that's awesome, but being cool is even better.  I'm cool.  What would it...  I just...  I'm not yelling at the person.  I'm yelling at the cards.  Well, see, yelling at the cards is cool. 
[00:33:00]  No, he yells at the person.  I yell at the person.  Sure he does.  It gets ugly.  Because some of you people get on rolls, and it's ridiculous.  I can't help but think...  21's out of your ass.  You pull 21's out of your ass.  That is true.  I've only watched Anthony a couple times.  I can't help but think if he didn't have so much action on the table, they would rip  him up off the table and throw him on the...  Take him out of your...  Use his head to open a fucking door.  That would have been me.  You would be flying out of the casino head first if you didn't have so much action on  the table.  I'm fancy.  They would have thrown him out the way Pesci threw Sharon Stone out of his restaurant 
[00:33:30]  in his stupid gold pants falling down the steps.  Be careful.  Oh, yeah.  Be careful.  Be careful.  Even if you're generous, I can guarantee that there's no break room motherfucking...  All right, madam.  We're laughing.  All right.  We're just having a little fun there.  Be careful.  Be careful.  You guys have a great day.  Ant fully realizes how much of a dick he is at the table.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Especially with...  Not especially when he's losing.  Because when he's winning, you know, everyone's happy. 
[00:34:00]  I'm winning.  It's a party at my table.  Party!  Ant actually sat down on the steps, and he's like, I'm in a tough fucking spot here, Frankie.  You've got a tough fucking spot, Frankie.  I fucked up, Frankie.  I fucked up with this broad.  Be careful.  Did he?  She was drunk driving through the neighborhood screaming, Nikki's my sponsor.  And have my husband killed.  He couldn't have fucked a worse woman.  And just, you know, he couldn't have fucked...  If he would...  Julian Assange wouldn't have blabbed as fast as fucking Sharon Stone did. 
[00:34:30]  Put my food down!  Oh, Kenny.  That's how I talked to Kenny.  Thank you.  Oh, shit, man.  There you go.  Vegas Sandra.  Check it in.  Made me pop your fucking eye out for Anthony fucking C!  Oh, that movie is...  Oh, by the way, WikiLeaks just...  They're going to now release the name of a lot of tax cheats.  Because some fucking Swedish banker gave up a lot.  And there's, like, some politicians.  And I'm actually happy. 
[00:35:00]  Wow, really?  Yeah, all these people would stick their money in Switzerland.  Like, I don't care about regular citizens.  That shit would be fun to...  Politicians?  Ooh, do I want them sunk.  I don't care who they are.  Why am I yelling?  Someone is absolutely going to do something bad to this gentleman.  It's hard, though, because he's like Hoover.  Jay Edgar had so much shit on everybody, people were afraid to kill him because you didn't know where the stuff was.  Yeah.  It's going to be a food poison thing.  Yeah, it'll be like one of those, what's it called, ricin?  Yeah, a little ricin action. 
[00:35:30]  You put it on at the end of an umbrella.  Or you walk past someone and just go, bink, into their leg.  And a week later, they're fucking dead.  Or they're going to cut his brake lines and have him drive around on the mountainside.  One of those action movies ones.  Grace Kelly.  He goes off the edge of the mountain.  Yeah, something's going to happen to that guy.  Yeah, I see that happening.  Someone else will do it, though.  Like, if it's not Julian, it'll be his assistant.  It'll be somebody, you know, there's always people in line.  Ready to rat.  And he had that 256 encrypted, digit or character encrypted file filled with a lot of shit. 
[00:36:00]  Look at what that ricin does to you.  Wow.  Yeah, it's a, wow.  That's that British spy guy, right?  Right, right, right.  He was fine.  And somebody actually, yeah, I think they poked him in the leg with something.  Or they put him in his food.  Why does he have the Jersey short tan, though?  Yeah, he turned orange.  I think that's when his liver told him to go fuck himself.  I said fuck you.  Oh.  Why don't we, uh, we should take a break, because we're going to move into the Golden Globes,  and that's going to take a lot of time. 
[00:36:30]  Ah.  A lot of time.  Ricky Gervais is a god today.  Gervais rules.  There you go, because everyone's asking her opinion.  He's a god.  Yes.  And we're going to get into the whole Golden Globes controversy after the break and some  other things.  Things.  Oh, uh, in honor of, uh, Martin Luther King Day.  That was yesterday.  And also the, uh, Huckleberry Finn thing.  Reflections.  We've got a little quick, uh, scene from Pulp Fiction where you take out the nasty word.  You can't, you can't have the nasty word.  You can't anymore. 
[00:37:00]  And we replaced it with Slave, just like they're going to do in Huckleberry Finn.  Oh.  So, take a listen to this as we go to break.  And now for another film classic adapted for the classroom by New South Films, publishers  of Huckleberry Finn.  Today's film, Pulp Fiction.  This is some serious gourmet shit.  Me and Vincent would have been satisfied with some freeze-dried taste of choice, right?  And he springs this serious gourmet shit on us. 
[00:37:30]  What flavor is this?  It's not good off, Julie.  I don't need you to tell me how fucking good my coffee is, okay?  I'm the one who buys it.  I know how good it is.  When Bonnie goes shopping, she buys shit.  I buy the gourmet expensive stuff because when I drink it, I want to taste it.  But you know what's on my mind right now?  It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.  It's the dead slave in my garage.  Oh, Jimmy, don't even worry about it.  No, no, no, no.  Let me not think about anything.  I want to ask you a question.  When you came pulling in here, did you notice a sign on the front of my house that said dead slave storage?  Jimmy, you knew I ain't seen no shit. 
[00:38:00]  Did you notice a sign on the front of my house that said,  dead slave storage?  No, I didn't.  You know why you didn't see that sign?  Why?  Because it ain't there.  Because storing dead slaves ain't my fucking business.  That's why.  Thank you for enjoying this clearly modernized edition of Pulp Fiction.  Stay tuned for more film classics adapted for the classroom by New South Films.  A little rough to be here today after the long weekend, huh? 
[00:38:30]  Nah.  And you throw in a little AC trip.  Yeah.  Holy yes.  Man, when it's time to leave that place, you want to get out of there as soon as fucking possible.  Yeah.  Because everyone decides to leave at the exact same time. 
[00:39:00]  Yep.  When did you leave?  I left.  I always leave gig night, like when I'm done, because of traffic.  Yesterday morning.  Oh, you're crazy.  How bad was traffic?  Why am I crazy?  I would rather sleep in.  Oh, and sit in traffic?  Never.  No, I wasn't in traffic.  Oh, okay.  I'm just saying, you have to get out before the big rush.  I fell asleep the second the car pulled out of the parking lot, and I woke up pretty much when I was home.  Time machine.  Nice.  That's it.  We were all crashed out. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Was everyone just snoozing all the way home?  Yeah, a little snoozage.  I like that.  And you kind of poke your head up every so often if you do wake up.  Oh, where am I?  I looked around.  I was like, oh, okay.  Yeah, it's Staten Island.  All right.  Back asleep.  Fuck it.  All right.  The Golden Globes.  Holy shit.  Yes, did take some time out, though, to watch some programming, like the Jets game, and then the Golden Globes.  I almost didn't want to go downstairs because you had the Jets game, which I ended up watching in my room. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  Because I wanted to take the whole thing in.  And it's tough to watch it at a sports bar.  Yeah.  Yeah.  With fans.  Because they all want to just kind of talk and stuff.  And I wanted to focus on the game.  Don't need to hear your jibber-jabber.  So I decided to watch it, you know, upstairs with a few people.  We had a good time.  And then it rolls into the Golden Globes.  You're like, there's no reason to go downstairs.  Yeah.  The TV's way too good, and the bed's too comfortable.  And you got room service. 
[00:40:30]  But Ricky Gervais did exactly what we've been hoping he would do and others would do with these award shows.  These award shows are a complete bore fest, and they suck each other's dicks, clits, and assholes.  They just suck each other off.  Yeah.  It's a big self-congratulatory clusterfuck.  So then to have a host that actually takes shots and has jokes about the whole thing, it's great.  It makes you want to watch this every year.  But what's going to happen, you're going to see the lamest Golden Globes next year. 
[00:41:00]  They're not going to have another Ricky Gervais or anyone close to him after what happened on Sunday.  The only reason I even tuned in was because I knew Ricky Gervais was hosting.  Right.  Like, I could give a fuck if you read the results afterwards.  I'm there for the speeches.  Like, I didn't care.  What if they said, the Golden Globes, hosted by Steve Carell.  I'm not watching.  Gone.  I'm not watching.  Exactly.  The only reason I watched was to see Ricky Gervais. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  And at one point, he was gone for an hour.  Yeah, he was getting scolded.  You think they were scolding him for his funny comment, funny, interesting hosting?  Well, after the monologue, I think everyone went into panic mode.  And they put him in a room and said, you know, they didn't know what to do.  Yeah.  So they said, fuck this.  Let him sit for an hour.  They're just babies.  They are babies.  Like, they want to lampoon everything.  And they want to be able to skewer everything.  But when a comedian does it as his job, they fucking, they cry. 
[00:42:00]  Why can't they understand it's a comedian?  They do know.  Some jokes and getting people laughing and getting the viewers involved.  No one was tuning out the Golden Globes after that monologue.  They're like, holy shit, what else is he going to say?  Actors are fucking boring.  They're boring.  Yeah.  Do you want to hear their speeches?  You know, I just want to thank my business manager and my publicist.  I mean, we had a great team.  Shut up. 
[00:42:30]  They are the worst speeches.  Terrible.  Shut up.  Oh, I have so many people to thank here.  And I don't have a lot of time.  So, first of all, the director whose vision was just.  He didn't have a vision, by the way.  He just got lucky.  That same director you won't hear from for the next 10 years.  That's it.  He got lucky.  If he had some kind of amazing vision, he would be up there every year.  It's just.  There's a lot of luck in Hollywood. 
[00:43:00]  Borefest.  I was also watching, not only for Ricky Gervais, but just to see how much more important some  people are than others when the guy has his finger on the get the fuck off the stage  music.  Love when they get the get the fuck off the stage music.  And I would just love to know who that guy is.  And if somebody points at him, if it's his discretion, the guy's just like, all right,  cut him off.  Yeah.  Dude.  And it starts low. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, yeah.  Not.  No.  And they push loud really fast.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Yeah.  Ricky had a blog, I guess.  Well, let's have Ryan say it.  Ryan in Jersey.  Ryan.  Ryan.  This is why Ricky fucking rocks.  Not only did he put on his blog that no one scolded him, no one gave him a hard time,  but he went into why the media are such a jerk off for making up these stories.  Because they want a more interesting story. 
[00:44:00]  They don't want to just hear like, yeah, I sit with funny lines and then we have some  drinks at the end.  They want to make it up like it was something to do and it gave him a hard time.  All right.  Well, I don't know, man.  The president of the foreign press, whatever.  Obama?  Had a few things to say about Ricky Gervais' performance.  Oh, that guy.  I hate that guy.  You saw that guy?  No, I know who he is, though.  Oh.  Yeah.  I do.  Do you really?  Yeah.  I guess Ricky's saying.  Larry Bertleby.  I guess Ricky's saying that he wasn't scolded backstage. 
[00:44:30]  They just.  I think that's what they do.  They give him a long monologue and then try to get the show moving.  Big break.  I do believe seeing in the past the host sits for a while after the monologue and then  he starts coming back out.  But we got the best of Ricky Gervais.  Fuck it.  We got it.  We got all the big moments from the Golden Globes with Ricky Gervais.  He doesn't host again, right?  Probably not.  Probably not.  Because he's not the type of guy they might say, could you calm it down and we'll have  you back?  No.  He's not one of those guys. 
[00:45:00]  He's not going to calm it down.  Get out.  And then he thanked God.  Get out.  Get out.  Did you hear him at the end?  I don't know if we got the clip where he thanks God for making him an atheist.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that was just a throwaway line as the credits are rolling.  People are like, what the fuck did he just say?  You're reaping the rewards.  Yeah.  Chasing the Yankee dollar.  Yeah.  Oi, Brent.  Oi, Brent.  Oi, Brent.  Oi, Brent.  You've achieved your dreams.  Your dreams.  Reaping the rewards.  But nobody was saying, Oi, Brent.  You've achieved success. 
[00:45:30]  That's what we were saying.  We had the exact same conversation.  Yeah.  You know, in my 30s.  Yeah.  Forget all that point about the Yankee dollar and all his success.  No one's ever yelling Oi, Brent to him.  Oi, Brent.  Yeah.  Hey, you've reached your dreams, but he hasn't.  You're reaping the rewards.  No one's told him that.  He hasn't done it.  Love it.  Ah, the music.  And I would like to, ah, fuck, I'll leave.  I guess we could do it this way, because it's got to start low. 
[00:46:00]  And lastly, I just want to thank.  They used to have class.  And now it's just, fuck it.  They used to have class where they let them sort of finish and slowly build it, but now  try it again.  This is how it goes.  Also, the cast is just an amazing cast.  If I could get through all the names of the cast.  We'll be back with more. 
[00:46:30]  Ricky Gervais, here we go.  Anyway, welcome.  The Golden Globes is a celebration of the best in TV and movies over the last year,  voted for by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.  It was a big year for 3D movies, Toy Story, Despicable Me, Tron.  Seems like everything this year was three-dimensional, except the characters in The Tourist.  That's great.  Come on, that's a funny line.  They were talking about how bad that movie was, how there was no chemistry. 
[00:47:00]  Between Johnny Deep.  In fact, that was nominated, from what I've heard, it's really embarrassing.  Angelina Jolie.  Angelina Jolie.  Angelina Jolie.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She got the...  I read one review that said it was as if both of their significant others were watching them  during the scenes to make sure nothing was going on.  And that's how plastic these two were together in the movie.  They had no chemistry, right?  None.  The two big shots, just in their big fancy trailers, their big fancy cars. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  Just a couple of big, highfalutin' big shots.  Highfalutin'.  I feel bad about that joke.  I, no.  No, I'll tell you what.  I'm jumping on the bandwagon, because I haven't even seen The Tourist.  Who has?  Um, but, no.  It must be good, because it's nominated.  So shut up, okay?  And I'd like to quash this ridiculous rumour going round, 
[00:48:00]  that the only reason The Tourist was nominated  was so the Hollywood Foreign Press could hang out with Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie.  That is, that is rubbish.  That is not the only reason.  They also accepted bribes.  Let's...  He doesn't care.  That's exactly what a comic should do.  He rules.  No.  All that happened was some of them were taken to see Cher in concert.  How the hell is that a bribe?  Really?  Do you want to go and see Cher? 
[00:48:30]  No.  No.  Why not?  Because it's not 1975.  It's perfect.  And he's getting big laughs from the audience, right?  Yeah, they're groaning, too.  And it's not like...  I would love to point out the groaners.  Who was groaning?  I don't need a show.  I know Christian Bale loved it.  He said it was right on.  And Paul Giamatti.  And Giamatti loved it.  Who else loved it?  I want a list of the people that loved it.  Because I'll go see their movies. 
[00:49:00]  It's not like some comic that is used to being squeaky clean and what part of the inside group got up there and started bashing people.  Gervais is known for his caustic wit.  Yeah.  That's the only reason a lot of us watched, right?  And the guy is so self-deprecating, too, whenever he writes a vehicle for himself or anything.  It's not like he's not doing it to himself a lot of times.  People are such fags.  Yeah.  Knock it off. 
[00:49:30]  Ricky talks about the Sex and the City broads.  We talk about the Sex and the City broads on this show.  There were a lot of big films that didn't get nominated this year.  Nothing for Sex and the City 2.  No.  I was sure the Golden Globe for special effects would go to the team that airbrushed that poster.  Great job.  Girls, we know how old you are.  I saw one of you in an episode of Bonanza. 
[00:50:00]  That's fucking funny.  Holy shit.  The show is old, get it?  Also not nominated, I Love You Philip Morris, Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor.  Two heterosexual actors pretending to be gay.  So the complete opposite of some famous Scientologist, then.  Um, what?  What?  Oh, oh, oh.  Probably. 
[00:50:30]  My lawyers helped me with a wording of that joke.  They're not here.  Okay.  They're not here.  Holy shit.  That could have been, you know, either Tom Cruise or it could have been John Travolta.  I think...  That's who I took from it.  It was those two, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If you had a...  If you were...  We're going to put some money down on that.  Sure.  That's what I thought he meant.  Wow.  That's what everyone thought he meant.  But who cared?  It's a joke.  Because they don't go down that road in Hollywood. 
[00:51:00]  It's one of those things everyone knows, but they don't talk about it.  It's reaping the rewards.  Yeah.  Oi, Brent.  You've achieved your dreams.  You're reaping your rewards.  No.  But the reality was they were all looking at him like, who is this asshole?  Who is this blithering idiot?  He's achieved nothing.  That's the best, man.  Fucking best.  Should we get on with it?  Our first presenter is beautiful, talented, and Jewish, apparently. 
[00:51:30]  Mal Gibson told me that.  He's obsessed.  Please welcome Scarlett Johansson.  She's lovely.  Yeah, she's fucking juicy, man.  That's what they call a sexy broad.  She's got a little sexiness going on.  Yeah.  Duncan Goodhue.  So what do you think so far?  It's good.  Outrageous, though?  Great job.  Not too outrageous.  No, it's what he should have been doing. 
[00:52:00]  He's doing the exact...  He's doing a great job at hosting.  I couldn't tell you what else happened at the Golden Globes.  Goofing on of the fucking...  He was the whole Golden Globes.  These dumb, elite fucking assholes.  Well, let's continue with Ricky Gervais at the Golden Globes.  You know our next presenter from such films as Hudson Hawk,  Look Who's Talking,  Mercury Rising,  Color of Night,  Fifth Element, 
[00:52:30]  Hearts War.  Please welcome Ashton Kutcher's dad,  Bruce Willis.  He named all of his shitty movies, too.  Hearts War.  Hearts War.  Hudson Hawk.  Come on.  He named all his shit movies.  That's so great.  What a prick.  Why kiss their asses?  Exactly.  Everyone knows what great movies he was in,  so why not have a little fun with it? 
[00:53:00]  These people,  all year long,  there's so many award shows,  they just get their asses lapped all the time.  That's all they do.  The fans lap their ass all the time.  And then Gervais gets up there  and tears them up a little bit for a night.  And...  Yeah.  Let's go to Lance in Minnesota.  Lance.  Lance!  Yeah.  Hey, guys,  I think you missed that Bonanza joke.  It sounds like he was kind of taking a shot  of one of the girls  maybe looking like a horse.  Yeah, I was thinking it was a horse joke myself. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, wow.  You know what?  Yeah, not only an old fucking reference,  but I think it was also a horse reference.  I didn't catch that.  Bonanza had a lot of horses in him.  But they set it up as being like  that they're old.  We know how old you are.  He's like, one of these was in Bonanza.  Could be a double-edged sword joke there, though.  It was,  because he could have picked any show  that didn't have horses.  True.  Yeah, I think you're right, Lance.  Yeah.  Damn!  I think it was an old horse joke.  Yeah.  And then Bruce came to the stage. 
[00:54:00]  After that great line.  Sometimes Hollywood does  provide you with outrageous fortune.  Ricky.  Wow, did Bruce fucking bomb on that line, huh?  What did he say?  I just missed out.  Sometimes Hollywood does provide you  with outrageous fortune.  Wait, no.  Ricky.  Jimmy missed it.  But he mumbled his lines.  Here it is.  Hold on.  Oh, no. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, he fucking blew it.  Sometimes Hollywood does provide you  with outrageous fortune.  Ricky.  Oh, he didn't deliver that well.  I hate a word show banter.  That was a humm and a humm and a humm and a humm and a.  That was someone.  He tripped over it the way I would trip over a line  in a scene with him.  That was someone trying to go off the cue cards there, huh?  I don't know.  That might have been a red line. 
[00:55:00]  They're always bad.  They're great actors,  and they're terrible at reading cue cards.  Christian Bell, thank God for comedians,  he said, adding that he had no problems  with Gervais' zingers.  I'm hoping he's going to keep going further.  I'm hoping he's going to keep going further,  and I'll be across the street at the Pantages.  Oh.  Al Pacino, I heard he was funny,  but there was somebody taller in front of me  I couldn't see.  Somebody got to put me on their knee like a puppet. 
[00:55:30]  I was cringing, hoping he wouldn't make a shoe, Joe.  Or wigs.  His hair was high.  Of course it was.  Oh, my God.  A little too high.  Read Al Pacino's quote there.  How's Al?  Anthony?  I don't care.  You can do it.  He's a comic, so he's going for it.  He's letting it go.  The only thing he can really get to is his own wit.  He has to censor himself.  I'm sure he plans some of it.  The jokes really fly. 
[00:56:00]  You don't know what he's going to say.  Yeah.  What the hell is Al talking about?  So Al is a big fan.  Stick it up for him.  Also, Jim Parsons from The Big Bang Theory.  These guys should get credit for liking Ricky Gervais.  And Heather Morris from That Glee Show  thought it was funny as hell.  Funny as hell.  Here's more Ricky Gervais,  the best of Ricky Gervais from the Golden Globes.  Next up, Eva Longoria has the daunting task  of introducing the president of the Hollywood Foreign Press. 
[00:56:30]  That's nothing.  I just had to help him off the toilet and pop his teeth in.  Um.  It was messy.  Please welcome Eva Longoria.  That's the main guy he's going after.  Good, yes.  God bless him.  Great.  And then the main guy hit the stage,  and this is what he had to say.  Thank you, Eva.  And Ricky,  next time you want me to help you qualify your movies,  go to another guy. 
[00:57:00]  Ooh.  As I look out at this amazing array of...  And he wasn't going for a joke.  Funny comeback.  No, he wasn't.  You old asshole.  I didn't say that.  He wasn't...  He wasn't happy with that.  Of course not.  He's a cadaver.  Don't you want me to qualify one of your movies, Jimmy?  Is that what you're going to qualify?  White Chicks Incorporated?  Fucking...  Oh, this is the Robert Downey Jr. thing.  Oh, no.  I hope he didn't poke fun at... 
[00:57:30]  He poked fun at Robert,  and Robert Downey Jr. responded.  What the entertainment shows have made a living  talking about and seriousness.  Right.  It's okay.  I love this next presenter.  He's so cool.  He's the star of Iron Man.  Two Girls and a Guy.  Wonder Boys.  Sorry, these porn films.  What?  Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.  Bow Finger.  Really?  Yeah.  Up the Academy. 
[00:58:00]  Come on.  He has done all those films,  but many of you in this room  probably know him best  from such facilities  as the Betty Ford Clinic  and Los Angeles County Jail.  Please welcome Robert Downey Jr.  Now, he should be able to take that.  Of course he should.  Of course he should.  He should be able to take that.  He didn't mind playing a drug addict  who was blowing people.  Like, why can't you be made fun of  when you fuck...  Come on.  Come on. 
[00:58:30]  Aside from the fact  that it's been hugely mean-spirited  with mildly sinister undertones,  I'd say the vibe of the show  is pretty good so far,  wouldn't you?  He was sort of trying to do both there.  Yeah, that was okay.  Trying to do both.  Don't be a baby hugely mean-spirited.  These pampered jizz buckets.  They're so used to publicists  just lapping their balls  and coddling them.  Oh, they're fucking awful. 
[00:59:00]  Lapping their balls.  But that's what they're used to.  Yeah.  A publicist who just do nothing  but slave over them.  And protect them  from anything like this.  Any of them can't take a good beating.  No.  They're fucking boring.  So why am I obsessed with them?  I don't know.  Because I'm a faggot, too.  The best of Ricky Gervais.  Steve Carell and Tina Fey.  He intros here.  Our next presenters  are two of the funniest people  in America. 
[00:59:30]  She stole the show  on Saturday Night Live,  then went on to create, write,  and star in her own show,  30 Rock.  He was a job in actor,  career not going that well  if I'm being totally honest,  who got his big break  when I cast him  in a remake  of a show that I created  called The Office.  He's now leaving that show  and killing a cash cow  for both of us.  Please welcome  the wonderful Tina Fey  and the ungrateful Steve Carell. 
[01:00:00]  That's very funny.  Killing a cash cow.  I'd be ungrateful Steve Carell.  Ha ha ha ha ha!  I love it!  Never gets old!  He can't improv.  Whatever.  He's the fucking worst.  I don't know why  I hate him so much.  Not a big fan.  Not a fan of Carell.  First couple seasons  of The Office,  he was really good.  I liked it.  And I loved him 
[01:00:30]  on The Daily Show.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, that's where  he made his bones.  That's where he made his bones.  Did you see Date Night?  Yeah.  I guess we could just  end the conversation  right there.  You know what?  You're right.  And finally,  one more from Ricky Gervais  at the Golden Globes.  What can I say  about our next two presenters?  The first  is an actor,  producer,  writer,  and director  whose movies have grossed  over three and a half  billion dollars  at the box office. 
[01:01:00]  He's won two Academy Awards  and three Golden Globes  for his powerful  and varied performances  starring in such films  as Philadelphia,  Forrest Gump,  Cast Away,  Apollo 13,  and Saving Private Ryan.  The other  is Tim Allen.  The comedian?  Tim Allen?  Yeah.  That's funny.  That's funny.  That's funny.  Come on.  Well, you know, 
[01:01:30]  like many of you,  we recall back  when Ricky Gervais  was a slightly chubby  but very kind comedian.  Neither of which  is he now.  They have nothing.  Tim Allen's  supposed to be  a funny guy.  That's all you got  after that beating  you took?  Yeah.  Jesus.  I think you did  very well.  Who?  Ricky Gervais.  Oh, he did wonderful.  I would have had  to have comebacks. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, yeah?  I would have slammed  them good.  Oh, Chip would have  fucking nailed them.  I would have  right out there.  Boom.  Boom.  Yeah, look at you  over there.  You can't even  say words  because you're  from another country.  Speak English  or something.  Yeah, what are you  doing?  You're talking  with a bunch  of little losers.  Whatever that is.  Chip just gets mean  when he's flustered.  Yeah, I would  hope your family dies.  So, you're not  going to see Ricky 
[01:02:30]  next year.  No, I don't think so.  That's a guarantee.  Maybe another award  show will pick him up  though and say,  fuck that.  20 million people  watched.  Another Angie award  show, yeah.  And like I said,  now that he's  getting all the  publicity, maybe  another award show  says, fuck that.  Well, the Oscars  has a good couple  of people.  It's going to be  a good Oscars  this year.  Who's the host?  There's two of them.  Two?  They're splitting  the duties.  Anne Hathaway.  And who's the actor?  It's a guy and a gal.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, it's going to be 
[01:03:00]  good.  Franco.  Um, Frank, right.  James Franco, Franco  from Spider-Man three.  Yeah.  And Anne Hathaway.  Are you sure that's  who it is?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's not Steve  Martin.  No, he's a great  Oscar host, actually.  Actually, because he's  kind of caustic and a  prick.  He was all right.  He was funny.  I mean, compared to  I can't watch Steve  Martin in anything now.  I like when he's doing  snarky stand up.  I really have to go  back and watch like  planes, trains, and 
[01:03:30]  automobiles, things like  that to laugh at Steve  Martin.  Like if I see him now  doing anything, I just  stop it.  It's going to be a good  Oscars this year.  I'm a girl.  Hey, man, you make fun,  but he's one of the  greats to follow on  Twitter.  Is he?  Steve Martin.  Oh, my God.  Have you seen his  Twitter?  I can tell you not  nary a one.  I've read some of  them.  Some of them were  actually funny, but I  didn't. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, my God.  He's unbelievable.  Twitter was made for  Steve Martin.  I'm telling you.  Read a few of these.  Let me see.  What's his?  Let's see.  According to the  new Zodiac sign  dates, I'm now a  kitten.  Okay.  We're trying to find 
[01:04:30]  one that would be  even good either way.  Let me see.  I guess he's  vacationing.  I paid a lot of  money to go on  vacation on a private  jet, but it has a  pilot.  I do like the one  enter your email  address and get a  free track from the  upcoming rare bird  alert.  I don't know what  that means, but it's  kind of funny.  I know what it  means.  No, but I mean,  like, it's just a  bizarre, weird thing. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, it's his new  album.  Yeah.  Okay.  It's funny.  It's just a plug,  Jimmy.  It's a plug.  Let me go to  Cassius in Brooklyn.  Cassius.  Hello, guys.  What's up, buddy?  Been a while.  Yeah, yeah.  I just, I just  got to wholeheartedly  agree with you,  like, that Steve  Carell, he's just so  fucking boring.  It's always with that  stupid little boy's  haircut of his and  the, just the face 
[01:05:30]  is so hard to look at,  the giant nose, and  it's just never funny.  It's just, it's just  horrible.  Yeah, I don't know  why Hollywood loves  this guy so much.  Yeah.  He's made about 20  movies in the last  four years.  Yeah, it seems  like it's always  What was the best  Steve Carell movie,  would you say?  I couldn't even,  what was the best  Steve Carell movie?  He was a 40-year-old  virgin, right?  40-year-old virgin,  probably because,  but now looking back 
[01:06:00]  at him was amazing.  But like, and it  was also, you  didn't know a lot  of those guys yet.  You were like,  wow, these guys  are funny, man.  It was also well  before he was  as overexposed as  he got.  You think there's  an overexposure  thing happening to him?  Oh, yeah.  After that, he was  all over the place.  Let me see his movies.  Let's try to be fair  with this.  I want to find  one movie.  There's no sense  in trying to be fair  because he's just  always the same  character.  It's the same  corporate boob,  boar, you know?  Well, yeah,  he completely ruined 
[01:06:30]  the Bruce Almighty  franchise, whatever  it was for.  Oh, and then  Get Smart.  Oh, he was  the Get Smart guy.  Get Smart.  Anchorman, was he  good in Anchorman?  Yeah, I guess  I'd have to  give it up for  a bit there, yeah.  Honestly, I don't  remember if he was  good in that.  The 40-year-old  virgin aunt was  saying what?  Yeah, it was  good, but you'd  have to put  yourself back in  time to watch it  because now that 
[01:07:00]  you know kind of  what he does.  I like that  little independent  film, Little Miss  Sunshine.  He played a more  serious role in that.  Yeah, yeah.  He was good in that.  I think he was  good in that.  I never saw  a four-year-old  virgin.  Ensemble.  Wait, there was  a Bruce Almighty  and then he did  Evan Almighty?  Oh, yeah, it was  a sequel.  Oh, my fucking  Lord.  Bruce Almighty  was Jim Carrey.  Am I correct?  Oh, and he was  in Bruce Almighty.  I guess he was  in it.  Oh, I forgot  that he was  even in that.  Oh, okay, and  then he took  over the lead  role in Evan  Almighty.  Okay, gotcha.  Dan in Real  Life. 
[01:07:30]  Horton Hears  a Who.  That's just a  voice.  Get Smart.  Date Night was  horrendous.  Despicable Me.  That's just another  voice movie.  Dinner for Schmucks,  I was fucking  pissed by that  movie because  they kept  the PC and  safe.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Ned Vinny.  There's not one  movie there that  I watched because  he was in it.  No.  Yeah, and even  the rare moments  where he has been  good in movies,  he's just ruined 
[01:08:00]  everyone's memory  because it's just  the same, you  know, casted  to the same  thing over and  over.  He's just ruined  and done.  I'm not a fan.  I'm not a fan.  Yeah.  Like I said, I was  a fan for the  first couple years  of English Office  because I was a  huge fan of the  British Office, but  then that got  kind of...  I haven't watched  The Office in  fuck years at  this point.  There's no reason  to.  I bailed a long  time ago.  I do still watch  it, I admit, but  it's not because I  think it's a good  show and it's a  favorite of mine.  I just have to  see how far removed 
[01:08:30]  can it get from  what it's supposed  to be.  Right.  And it's so far  towards the other  way.  And every time I  watch a new  episode, I'm  like, well,  that's it.  They can't go...  How many years  have they...  It's been shit  for like three  seasons.  But how many  years have they  done The Office?  Because Ricky  Gervais, the  original was 12  episodes.  12 great episodes  and one season  finale.  2005 to 2011.  Six years.  That's it.  Man.  Seems like it's  been a long time.  Because I felt  like the American  Office kind of  switched focus.  I felt like the  English Office,  like sure, you had  Brent in there, he's 
[01:09:00]  a great character, but  it was really more  about the relationship  between Pam, not  Pam, I'm sorry,  Dawn and Tim.  And then when you  get to the American  Office, it was like,  well, that could  happen too, but it's  more about the  retard boss being  crazy.  And he did start  just becoming a  retard and not just  the goofy, awkward  guy.  Because Gervais was  great because he was  the boss who just  made things awkward  and he was a real  person.  Everybody could  relate to that.  I can't relate to  any of Steve  Carell's.  Steve Carell turned  into a retard.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why is he still  worried? 
[01:09:30]  He'd be fired  thousands of times.  Is he still  awkward, though?  Cool.  A little bit.  Cool.  I like that, that  awkwardness.  You're like, ah,  this poor guy  doesn't know how to  talk.  Yeah, thank you,  Cash.  Let's go to Dave  in Alberta.  Dave.  Oh, hey, how's it  going?  Hey, Dave.  What's going on,  you guys?  Oh, no, I'm just  sitting on the toilet  here taking a crap.  Are you actually  discussing this  bullshit?  What's that?  Oh, no, I asked  if you were  discussing this.  Are they  Golden Globes  or, yeah, why?  Golden Globes 
[01:10:00]  Award.  Yeah, why not?  Yeah.  Why the fuck  would you?  Because it was a  big award that  was on TV and  they're writing  about it in the  press and we  like Ricky Gervais  and we like the  fact that he  slammed a lot of  people there.  Your phone sucks.  Hopefully you're  falling down your  own toilet right now.  Yeah, what do you  want us to talk  about the day  after?  Yeah, it's a  big deal, this  Ricky Gervais thing.  If this was your  show, what would  you talk about?  We talked about  our weekends.  What would you  like us to talk  about? 
[01:10:30]  Dave, you  got to call  back when you  got a phone.  We'll take  your call, but  we can't hear  your phone is  terrible.  Of course we're  talking about  Ricky Gervais  because we talk  about this all  the time, how  it's so soft  out there in  general and then  you finally get  a guy that's  willing to go  for it.  Put it out  there.  And now there's  problems.  Yeah.  And we're  going to continue  talking about the  Golden Globes because  Robert De Niro had  such an amazing  fucking speech,  man.  The magic.  The magic that is  Robert De Niro. 
[01:11:00]  One of our great  actors of all  time.  Oh, yes.  You want a Cecil  B. DeMille or is  it Cecil?  Cecil.  Cecil B. DeMille  award.  Is that what they  gave him?  Is that what it  was?  For what?  Being at least a  decade in between  good movies?  I love De Niro,  but Jesus, Bob.  Oh, God.  Well, string of  duds.  Are you allowed  to call him  Bob?  Yes.  I don't know if  you're up to that  point in your career.  Call him Bobby.  The worst part of  that whole thing was  he's not at that  stage where you  could call him 
[01:11:30]  Bob.  I made him laugh.  That's all that  matters.  I heard him when  he saw me do  stand-up at the  cellar.  Oh, you heard  the laugh?  It threw me.  My next joke, I  fucked up because I  was doing my  stand-up.  I knew he was in  the room.  Was it the  Cape Fear laugh?  It was, uh, how  was the Pumpkin's  laugh?  It was the one  night my flip cam  didn't work that  piece of...  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was that type.  It was like that.  Ah!  But it was like a  Rupert Pumpkin laugh  and it threw me.  But there's also the  Cape Fear laugh.  You just kind of  blew by that line.  I know.  That's really  maniacal.  Yeah, that was more 
[01:12:00]  of a twisted laugh.  No, no, no.  It was more the  Pumpkin.  The worst thing was  they showed so many  clips from his  great movies.  Like, they're showing  all of his great  movies when he was  younger and just  doing magnificent  movies.  And, uh, then he  gets up there and  it's just, oh,  that's the meet  the fuckers guy.  Why are you doing  it?  Meet the fuckers.  Fuckers, whatever.  Fuckers.  Dipshits.  Lousy movies. 
[01:12:30]  Here's De Niro.  This was an amazing  moment.  Really.  Just terrific.  I know it won't be  long before Matt  Damon is up here  receiving his own  Cecil B.  DeMille Award.  And it will be my  honor to present it  to him if I'm still  alive.  So, uh, and I  plan to be around  for a long time,  hopefully.  We got it, Bob.  We got it.  So, I want to  thank the Hollywood  Foreign Press  Association, but 
[01:13:00]  don't wait down.  They skipped ahead  with my, uh,  thank you for this  extraordinary cause.  I was very, very  moved and gratified  when you made the  announcement two  months ago, well  before you had a  chance to review  little fuckers.  Yeah.  My name is  Wilbur Pupkin.  I saw those.  It's okay.  We all have our  jobs to do.  The reviews weren't  good for the little  fuckers?  I don't think so.  People are seeing  that movie, though. 
[01:13:30]  They're enjoying the  hell out of it.  Give you my spot.  Thank you for your  tireless work in  promoting our industry  all over the world.  Thank you.  And the important  thing is that we are  all in this together.  The filmmakers who  make the movies and  the Hollywood Foreign  Press Association  members who in turn  pose for pictures  with the movie  stars.  Bring it over here. 
[01:14:00]  I'm sorry more  members of the  foreign press aren't  with us tonight, but  many of them were  deported right before  the show.  Smooth delivery.  Can we hear that  line again, please?  This is the guy that  delivered, give me a  stage where this  bull here can rage.  Rage.  In a choppy way that  was perfect.  Like he was really  just a fucking, a  schlubby ex-boxer.  Right.  And he was a  brilliant.  This is the guy that 
[01:14:30]  butchered if he's a  degenerate when he was  being Jake telling  Joe.  And it was the best  purposeful trip I think  has ever been filmed.  But here he is really  trying to speak.  This is him telling a  joke.  I'm sorry more members  of the foreign press  aren't with us tonight,  but many of them were  deported right before the  show.  Well, they were  deported.  Deported.  Deported.  I like the little  noise he made right  before.  Deported. 
[01:15:00]  I love him, but he  should just never talk.  No.  We do it.  Deported.  Deported.  Right before.  He was going to say  before, but he realized  the cadence and taste  there.  Deported.  He might just say  before the show, but  it's right before the  show.  Along with most of the  waiters.  What are they  calling for?  Because waiters are  usually far.  For the rest of you, I  hope your papers are in  order because Homeland 
[01:15:30]  Security will be  checking them just as  soon as they're through  in the full body scans  of Megan Fox.  Megan Fox has grown  into a beautiful woman.  Kind of went a little  along with that  subject, huh?  It's, uh...  It was just...  It had no bite.  There's nothing to it,  right?  There's no bite.  There's no rhythm to it.  There's no timing to it.  It's just... 
[01:16:00]  There's nothing  memorable about it.  No.  It's just drivel.  Oh.  I want to thank  Dick Clark Productions  for that impressive  film tribute.  It's going to be hard  to pull off false  modesty after that.  Thank you.  Raging Bull.  Goodfellas.  Godfather 2.  Awakenings.  You know, Awakenings  was one of my  favorite movies.  Great performance  by Robin Williams.  That's a shift.  I just completely 
[01:16:30]  forgot that I was in it.  But there were a lot  of my movies missing  from the presentation.  There would have to be  when you condense  a four-decade career  into three minutes.  I look at it  and think Christ.  How about I...  Did you say Christ?  Yeah, I think so.  But we'll know  that's not the story.  There were other films,  though, lots of them.  And I kind of wish  they'd been included, too.  I think you would have  enjoyed seeing a few 
[01:17:00]  seconds of Stanley and Iris.  Everybody...  Everybody's fine.  Frankenstein.  Marvin's Room.  Stone.  Some of you  would be seeing them  for the first time.  Most of you  would be seeing them  for the first time.  You should have said  that first...  You didn't even watch  the screeners, did you?  He should have just said  most of you  would be seeing them  for the first time.  Be more funny!  This is going great! 
[01:17:30]  It's brutal.  Did you see that, jerk?  You could have seen  Stanley and Iris.  But my irises  need glasses  or something.  Chip De Niro.  Chip De Niro.  You know,  my mother's a saint  on earth  or something.  Most of you 
[01:18:00]  would have seen them  for the first time  or something.  One more  from Robert De Niro.  The energy is  being sucked  out of this room.  God bless his heart.  Thanks to De Niro.  Now, Ricky Gervais,  here's how I imagine  the evening started.  The band strikes up  the music  and you introduce me.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  It's okay.  It's okay.  Along with this award, 
[01:18:30]  I'm announcing a DVD box set  of all the work,  of all my work  so that if you've missed,  say, Jackknife,  the first time around,  you'll be able to catch up.  And I'll be selling them  in the lobby  right after I post  for some more  more pictures  with the remaining members  of the Hollywood Farm Press  as well.  These movies,  all of them,  are like my children  except that  my children  are more expensive  and you can't remake them  in 3D  to push up  the grosses. 
[01:19:00]  You do the best  you can with your children.  You do the best  you can making movies.  At a certain point,  you just have to let  both of them go  and hope for the best.  It's up to the audiences  to decide  if it's entertainment,  the critics  to decide if it's good  and ultimately,  posterity  to decide if it's art.  And for the children,  you just hope  the movies do well enough  so you can keep them  in private schools.  Thank you for this.  Thank you very much.  He's not an 
[01:19:30]  off-the-cuff type of guy.  No.  Not an off-the-cuff  type of guy.  If you said,  what's your name,  you'd have to pull  his license out.  You know,  you know,  I have to  take some  pose for some pictures  with the foreign,  move the card,  press.  How do you  remember lines?  You know,  posterity  to determine  if it's  art,  Connie.  Art,  Connie. 
[01:20:00]  Oof,  yee.  Oh,  wow.  God damn.  Let me say hi  to Randy  in Illinois.  Randy.  Hey,  brother.  Hey,  buddy.  Fucking De Niro  and I don't know  the other guy  from Meet the Fockers  is on Letterman.  It's pretty awkward,  dude.  De Niro wasn't  talking to Letterman  for some reason.  Oh,  it's Dustin Hoffman?  You mean the other guy?  I heard,  yeah,  Dustin Hoffman.  I heard it was awful.  Maybe we can find  a clip of that.  Of course it was awful.  We don't have to play the whole thing,  but maybe a couple clips.  Yeah,  like very awkward.  More visual,  but.  Was it? 
[01:20:30]  Yeah,  we'll take a look.  I think that's going to work.  I didn't hear it was bad.  All right,  let's see.  I would do a good interview  with De Niro.  I'd like to have De Niro  in room for 15 minutes.  I would do a really good interview.  Yes.  What would you do?  Just talk to him.  What would you do differently?  Do you think he would  be open to that?  Yeah.  Yeah?  All you can do  is talk about his movies.  But I would ask him.  He doesn't seem to want  to talk about anything.  Exactly.  When you see him on talk shows,  he just doesn't want to talk about it.  What do you do in a scene  if the other guy is struggling?  Ask him to say,  that was a good question  for Stacey Keech.  You know, 
[01:21:00]  just,  you know,  hope he gets it.  You wait  until the,  you know,  he gets the part.  Director tells him.  Yeah,  yeah.  So how long  before you do a role  do you actually  decide  how you're going  to do lines?  Like,  do you make that decision  before?  Or is it true  that I've heard  that you don't make  that decision  until basically  right before  it's time to shoot  so you don't get  caught in bad habits?  You know,  you know, 
[01:21:30]  I just,  I don't know.  Both.  Both.  It is just so bad,  man.  Do you think  people have  the same perception  of your work  now  that they had  20 years ago?  I mean,  you haven't won  an Oscar in a while,  but I mean,  you've taken on  different kind of roles.  I mean,  do you think  people's perception  is different?  I don't know.  You just  make a movie  and hope  that they, 
[01:22:00]  people have eyes.  And kids  in private school.  See it.  They can't.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Kevin.  It's terrible.  That speech  was enraging bullshit.  What's that?  I didn't hear you.  Yes,  you did.  Enraging bullshit.  That was really bad.  He's just not  a good speech maker.  No. 
[01:22:30]  He's,  it's weird  that he actually,  he does speaking engagements  and I don't know why.  Who would hire him?  I mean,  to hang with De Niro,  but.  Yeah,  that's pretty much it.  They don't care  what's coming out  of his yap.  Yeah,  they're not even  listening to the,  the whole time  they're like,  holy shit,  that's De Niro.  Ugh.  But he'll do like  a three night engagement.  He probably gets  a fucking million dollars.  What does he talk about?  We should find out.  I don't know.  I know this weekend  he's going to be  in Austin,  Texas  at the Cap City Comedy Club.  Jesus Christ.  Thursday,  Friday,  Saturday.  if you want  to see  Bob De Niro 
[01:23:00]  not  capcitycomedy.com  January 20th  to the 22nd.  Good one,  huh?  Good one.  Good one.  Cap City.  That means  everybody  should wear caps  to the city.  Austin.  Well,  the powers that be  will tell me  if Austin is there.  Terrible.  Terrible.  Break time. 
[01:23:30]  We were going  to work yesterday.  We decided not  to whatever.  So we were going  to play these clips  yesterday.  Yeah.  For Martin Luther King Day.  Yes.  Getting rid of  the dirty word  in movies  just like they're  doing in  Huckleberry Finn  there.  Oh,  the horrible  offense of the  N-word.  We did a  Pulp Fiction  scene earlier.  Now we go  to True Romance.  Oh,  I think I know  what scene this could be.  Instead of the bad word,  we replaced it  with Slave  because that's  what they're doing  with the Huckleberry Finn  book,  right?  Of course.  So check this out. 
[01:24:00]  And now for another  film classic  adapted for the classroom  by New South Films,  publishers of  Huckleberry Finn.  Today's film,  True Romance.  You're a Sicilian, huh?  Yeah.  I'm Sicilian.  You know,  I read a lot,  especially about things,  about history. 
[01:24:30]  I find that shit  fascinating.  Here's a fact.  I don't know whether  you know or not.  Sicilians were spawned  by slaves.  Come again?  Come again?  It's a fact, yeah.  You see,  Sicilians have 
[01:25:00]  slave blood  pumping through  their hearts.  And no,  if you don't believe me,  you can look it up.  Hundreds and hundreds  of years ago,  you see,  the Moors  conquered Sicily  and the Moors  aren't slaves.  See,  you see,  way back then,  Sicilians were like  wops from northern Italy.  They all had blonde hair  and blue eyes.  But,  well,  then the Moors  moved in there 
[01:25:30]  and,  well,  they changed  the whole country.  They did so much  fucking  with Sicilian women,  huh,  that they changed  the whole bloodline  forever.  That's why  blonde hair  and blue eyes  became  black hair  and dark skin.  You know,  it's absolutely  amazing to me  to think  that to this day,  hundreds of years later,  that,  that Sicilians 
[01:26:00]  still carry  that slave gene.  Now,  this,  no,  I'm quoting.  history,  it's written,  it's a fact,  it's written.  I love this guy.  I love this guy.  No.  You're ancestors  are slaves.  Uh-huh.  Hey.  Yeah. 
[01:26:30]  And,  and your great,  great,  great,  great grandmother  fucked a slave.  Oh,  yeah.  And she had  a half-slave kid.  Now,  if that's a fact,  tell me,  am I lying?  Because you,  you're part  eggplant.  Thanks for enjoying 
[01:27:00]  this clearly  modernized edition  of True Romance.  Stay tuned  for more film classics  adapted for the classroom  by New South Films.  The Virus.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Damn it.  Damn it.  Damn it.  And now,  and now,  the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Virus. 
[01:27:30]  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  So there's Giffords Broad.  Yeah,  huh?  She's the miracle lady,  huh?  Shot in the head.  Shot in the head  and now they're starting  to say that she's going  to be released  within days or weeks.  That is quite amazing.  And over the weekend,  we learned that  she actually gave  her husband  a back massage 
[01:28:00]  for 10 minutes.  What the fuck?  She's got the worst  headache imaginable  and she's fucking  rubbing her husband's back.  Maybe the husband  could have said like,  you know,  eh, it's alright.  Maybe the husband  could have said,  yeah, we played  a game of Scrabble  because now you  look like an asshole.  She's in bed  with this head wound  and she's giving you  a massage.  It's like,  honey,  I've been really  stressed out.  Yeah.  You know,  maybe my muscles  are a little tight.  You want to help me out here?  Yeah, you know,  I was hanging with Obama  and it's very stressful  being with the President  of the United States. 
[01:28:30]  Mind rubbing this out?  Yeah, I think...  I want to know  what her injury  is going to be in the end.  I'm just going to look  a little funny.  I don't know.  It's fucked up.  Most people would take  that contract, right?  Head wounds are really  fucked up.  But it looks like  there's not much  of a head wound going on.  The bullet hit just right.  Yeah.  It had to mess up something.  You would think.  That's a lot of shit  for a bullet to go through.  Who the hell knows?  Where did it go in?  Like,  it went in, 
[01:29:00]  what did they say?  The front,  over the eye or something.  That's the...  It came out the back.  Okay.  And,  but it just kind of  hit the top part  of the brain  and all the important  stuff's inside.  Fucking eye.  So what,  just scrape the brain  kind of like,  you know what I mean?  Yeah,  like kind of,  you know.  Is there a layer  we're allowed to lose?  Kind of like your layer  of skin on your,  on your arm or something?  I guess.  They give you a little bit  in the brain?  Yeah,  they give you a little buffer. 
[01:29:30]  You can skim off the top  a little bit.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  you can take a little  off the top.  Fucking bullet tore  through her head  and all of a sudden  she's playing bocce ball  a week later.  Everything's fine.  Jesus.  She's giving her husband  a back rub.  I like him.  Why would you allow  that out there though?  Just say she did  anything but that.  But took care of you.  Say she blew you.  That'd be even  a better story.  Right.  Jesus.  So we got,  we got that going on.  Yeah.  Also,  Zsa Zsa Gabor  does not have  a right leg anymore.  Oh boy. 
[01:30:00]  For the old timers,  Zsa Zsa Gabor  has one leg now.  She doesn't know it either.  That's what her husband's saying.  I guess the gangrene  got the leg.  How did she get gangrene  in the hospital?  The Jets?  Oh.  Well,  they shipped the leg  off to Rex Ryan.  He's going to enjoy that one.  He's just going to play  with the foot  on the end of it.  He's going to lick him  and then he's going  to eat the foot.  Accomplishing two  of his fucking fetishes.  How did she get the,  how did she get gangrene though?  She probably had  no circulation  going on down there. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  It could be clean  and everything  but if you don't have  any blood  going down there  oxygenating  the tissue  then your leg  falls off.  I'm thinking  that's probably  what happened.  Unbelievable.  My professional  diagnoses  as a radio personality.  They made a good observation.  Was the Miss America  pageant down in AC  while we were there?  Isn't that where  it is all the time?  Where do they have it?  What casino?  One of the Trump's  Trump Marino  or the other one? 
[01:31:00]  Is there other ones  down there?  Tangiers?  Tangiers.  17 year old wins.  It says hi.  I hate that chick.  She's the best.  We had a 17 year old  win that.  Yeah.  I was all psyched  and excited  when I saw the email  about all the subject matter  and it said 17 year old  wins Miss America  and I'm like okay cool  let me click on that  and check her out  and I clicked  and checked her out  and she looks like  just any other one  of these Miss Americas  that are anywhere 
[01:31:30]  they look like  anywhere between  28 and 33  they don't look  they're 8  yeah she looks  she doesn't look 17  she should look 17  yes  that's what I was saying  but it's all fake shit  on them  yeah  and they don't  gussy them up  to look like  younger  they make them look  like they're  older than they are  you ever see these  pageant women  up close and personal 
[01:32:00]  yeah they all just suck  yeah we've had a couple  in on the show  they're all  too perfect  yeah they're too  gotta throw a little  mud off  they're too generic  is what it is  right  I want a little  personality  you know  give me  give me something  some of the big  smoky eyes  or something  but they  they put their  makeup on the same  they just  look she's got  the big dumb  blonde hair thing  and she looks like  some corn fed  bitch from  fucking  wherever 
[01:32:30]  oh  well  she's pretty though  that looks a little  better  all right  another picture  all the better  to come across  my dear  she's a giant  forehead  yeah that's a little  big  she kind of puts  her hair in front  of it  looks okay  that picture  didn't look bad  with her dumb  crown on her head  that looks silly  yeah  that's the crown  they put on Kong  and they were  displaying him  her big fucking  skull  uh  no 
[01:33:00]  she's just  there  no big deal  I'd rather watch  Little Miss Perfect  oh she's a pretty  girl man  toddlers in tiaras  you think she's  pretty  yes  you can't say  she's not  yeah  she's all right  very pretty  yeah but not  Miss America  pretty  she got that  whole look  she's all right  pretty  just all right  what else  uh  wow  for the hockey  fans  holy shit  Mark Messier  is 50 today  holy shit  are you  are you kidding  me  wow

[01:40:30]  what that means  you know  it's like uh  people that have  a shitload of  stocks like  mutual funds  in a sector  and then they  sell it off  because of um  because of apple  but the other  parts of the  sector get  sold off also  you can't sell  off a piece  of of a fund  you know  do they have  apple in mutual  funds  so yeah  let's say  there's uh  you know  apples in  there and  then there's  a bunch of  other tech  stocks in  there you  sell it  off and  you're selling  off all  those other  ones too  because you're  getting rid  of apple  why don't  they just  sell apple  and nothing  else 
[01:41:00]  because it's  a packaged  fund  it's  who decides  what goes  into a mutual  fund package  mutual fund  manager  and they put  it together  and it's  supposed to  keep you  from really  it's supposed  to diversify  it so that  if one stock  takes a big  hit the other  ones don't  but  do you buy  packages from  people like  you buy your  package  you buy  it's a fund  it's a mutual  fund  you look in  in your  prospectus  and you see  what's in  there  what's in  the fund  and you know  there are  certain tech  funds  and then  there are  other funds 
[01:41:30]  that just  take up  different sectors  more diversified  I don't know  what that means  it's just  a bunch of  shit  it's like  the casino  you put  your money  in  hope to  take money  out later  someone's  saying that  Jobs isn't  just a figurehead  there  he approves  and denies  everything  that is  I'm not  saying a  figurehead  yeah he's  doing a  job  but it's  not  he's not  the guy  in the  labs  coming up  with all  the new  shit  is he  approving  and denying  shit  sure 
[01:42:00]  he's the  boss  because  they're probably  coming up  with some  shitty stuff  in the labs  too  yeah yeah  exactly  so he's smart  enough to go  no I got  the vision  we don't need  that  but look at  Microsoft  you know  I mean  fucking  that's been  running  fine  and  Microsoft  and what's  his name  ain't even  fucking part  of it anymore  exactly  when was the  last time  you heard  about Microsoft  what's his  name  Bill Gates  what's his  face  they're working  on a new  pancreatic  app  no but it's 
[01:42:30]  true  Bill Gates  you know  hasn't been  in charge  over there  he's been  just pretty  much the  figurehead  and it works  they keep  putting shit  out  literally  like what  operating  systems  and  operating  systems  phones  that no  one wants  some kind  of tablet  what's  what's  worse  than  a  Windows  operating  system  on a  phone  oh  they  are  shit  yeah  yeah  it really 
[01:43:00]  is bad  it just  doesn't  work  I had  my experience  with that  one time  when the  Motorola Q  first came  out  it was like  the beginning  of smartphones  and everything  and that  operating system  was so buggy  and laggy  that I  ended up  eventually  snapping my  phone in half  over my knee  it was just  enough  I told you  I bought  one and I  literally  think  before I  got home  I had  thrown it  out the  window  you were  like  fuck  I was  on one  of my  most  sleep  modes  yeah  it was  it was  so bad 
[01:43:30]  it was  just  wouldn't  start  up  I brought  it back  I didn't  throw it  I brought  it back  it was a  nightmare  I don't  mind Windows  7  I don't  like it  like  is it  better than  Windows  Professional  XP  no XP  XP was  always good  as far as  Windows  goes  Vista  was just  a complete  fucking waste  a bomb  a bomb  tank  so now  Windows 7  isn't that bad  it's pretty good  what's good about it  like does it still  Vista just  looked shitty  yeah Vista  looked shitty 
[01:44:00]  they were trying  so hard  to fucking  do  make  again  make it  like an Apple  make it  like a  Mac OS  and they  just failed  miserably  it was so  buggy  it sucked  I hate the fact  that you still  can't just  sometimes get  out of a  fucking  program  with Windows  why do I  have to sit  here and watch  that stupid  spinny thing  go round  and round  and round  force quit  on Apple  is amazing  force quit  rocks  love it  how often  do you ever  have to press  the power  button  on  to shut 
[01:44:30]  the whole  fucking  thing down  because it's  frozen  you constantly  have to do  that on  Windows  hate it  what  I do  just  just yapping  computers  computers  we were  watching  some  old school  VH1  classic  over the  weekend  fucking  I think  Danny at  one point  just said  like  was I ever  into metal 
[01:45:00]  or I'm  officially not  into metal  anymore  I listen  to metal  for a long  time  and then  what happens  is that  you've been  listening to  metal  for a long  time  and then  you look at  some of  this shit  and I mean  that's beyond  the stuff  I like  the kind  of stuff  but even  still you look  at it  and it almost  makes you  not want to  ever tell  people that  you like  to listen  to metal  because it's  just like  it's so  embarrassing  the video  the funny thing  is a lot  of people  are like  what happened  to the videos  on MTV 
[01:45:30]  and then you  look back  and realize  there's no  reason to have  videos  you're right  they're terrible  it was just  a thing  a passing fad  I was watching  so much shit  just going  I don't  I don't even  get what  they're trying  to do here  there's something  dressed like  a monster  and it's  it's in  gauzy things  and the director  is filming it  through dripping  water  oh hearing aid  was  the best  the late  Ronnie James  what is this  about  but this was  there  we are the  world  look at 
[01:46:00]  all these  guys  it's all  the metal  guys of  the time  getting together  getting together  to do a  hearing aid  hearing aid  you know  it was  hearing aid  I think  that was  what's his name  from journey  what a great  voice  sounds great  Halford  they all  sound the 
[01:46:30]  same too  that damn  Dio could  belt out a  tune  yeah Dio rule  Kevin Debrow  oh he's also  dead  he's dead  Debrow is  yes  one of those  cocaine  yeah  here's the big  car so they all  got together  hey you  they're stars  they all look 
[01:47:00]  in pain  Eric Boom  from  Blue Oyster Cult  Paul Shortino  from Rough Cut  never heard of it  Jeff Tate  from Queensryche  looks like an ass  Steve Carlesi  Carlesi  Don Dockin  they all do  sound alike  what about  what about  a band called 
[01:47:30]  Dockin now  yeah sing it  stars  oh that's an  awful video  and honestly  this one's not  even that bad  it's just the only  thing I can remember  I don't remember  what some of the  other videos were  really bad  Ozzy wasn't in this  no they didn't have  the Spinal Tap  guys  Spinal Tap  guys  wow this is  horrid  it is so  utterly bad  Craig Goldie 
[01:48:00]  from Goofria  who the fuck  are they  Eddie O'Hita  from Twisted  all right  Twisted  the Clusterfuck  guitar solos  yeah  the hair is just  beyond reason  86  that's about  right  somewhere in  there  Vivian Campbell  from Dio  yeah  Brad Gillis 
[01:48:30]  he ruined  Ozzy  he played  after Randy  died  yeah  after Bernie  there's also a  great point  made  I think  the wording  was something  like how come  how come no one  was ever  young in an  80s band  like 80s bands  they were always  35 years old  all the time  Neil Schoen  from Journey  Schoen  Schoen  whatever  whatever  exactly  he's no shape  to his biceps  George Lynch 
[01:49:00]  with the cut off  shirt  oh yeah  and the bleached  hair  yeah he kind of  looked like Randy  Rhodes  but not as good  oh the intense  facials  I love the  intense facials  it's just  these  how much money  did this charity  raise  anyway  287 dollars  yeah really  what the fuck  gave to this  gotta sell the  single  they sold a  casingle of it  I think  remember a  casingle  the cassette  single  oh my god  yes  put out on a 
[01:49:30]  casingle  they were  caships  it was  could jam up  in my machine  is what  those fucking  things did  never had  enough weight  on the wheels  it's a long  solo  it's endless  it is  gotta give all  the guitar  gods their  shot  yes  there's way  too much  to go  no  Carlos Cavazos  from Quiet Riot  of course  I'm right with  this  no one enjoys  this  it's too long 
[01:50:00]  come on  where's Eddie  Van Halen  they rule  where's Iomi  they weren't  invited  he's one of the  hair bands  yeah he's a real  hair band  all right  with the guitars  where's fucking  anybody from  Metallica  where's anyone  from Motley Crue  oh  blue oyster  cult  this is my point  let's say you  don't listen to 
[01:50:30]  metal  and I'm talking  to you  I'm like  oh so what  are you listening  to and I'm like  oh you know  I listen to a lot  of metal  and then you're  flipping through  VH1 classics  and you see this  yeah  you'll be like  oh I get it  so I think I'm  just gonna say  I like rock  all kinds of rock  music  we're magic in the  night  that's not a good  line  another shadow  they are light  also  the terrible  you and I  that guy was  wearing his marble  gloves  so you don't get  marble hands  oh and now 
[01:51:00]  the big  now they show  photos from the  drummers  yeah  oof  pink shack  oh this is  is that  Blackie Lawless  I think it is  from looking like  an ass  from Wasp  the Nuge  was that the  Nuge  that was the  Nuge  a lot of  these guys  were almost  almost bald  with perms  yeah  that's pretty much  it  almost bald  with perms  there's nothing  worse  to try to fill it  in  than an almost  bald guy  with a perm  and it was great 
[01:51:30]  with the back  lighting on the  stage  you could see  right through  a foot of  their hair  you try to fill  it in with  circles  was that  Rosie  there's Rosie  in the big  fucking  super group  wow  I don't even  know  maybe we could  go here  Sean in Philly  writes  one of the  worst metal  videos  Candlemas  doing Bewitched  did we do  that one  that sounds  very familiar  can we give it  a shot  I don't know 
[01:52:00]  we'll give it  a shot  that was an  awful  VH1 classics  not bad though  in general  no  but they're  playing  you know what  they play a lot  of metal  they play a lot  of 80s  and stuff  yeah  the videos  themselves  no  but it's  kind of  cool to  see  oh yeah  I remember  that  yeah  tearing a  coffin  the hell  is this  crap  they were all  trying to win  like video 
[01:52:30]  of the year  back then  so they dressed  in black  he's got the  slash hat on  and the cigarettes  what a rip off  tearing the coffin  yeah but one guy  he's got like  a hat like  slash  he's got a  cigarette  he's trying  so hard  yeah  they're doing  that walkie  walk  that uh  the pallbearer  walk  is that it  how long is this  really what the fuck  we got it  there's a grave  this video was done  in someone's  backyard  they're all  wearing hats  messiah  or colon  is this garbage 
[01:53:00]  now they're on stage  there's smoke  there's four fans  jumping  you can't even  see the band  there's so much  smoke  yeah  it's like  spinal tap  shit  cheers  in Babylon  yeah  we're rocking  they're all  melodramatically  looking down  in the grave  yes  they should all  hop in  I want to hear  the voice  then we can  move on  it's probably  an instrumental  now they're 
[01:53:30]  panning back  over the  fucking  four faces  once again  looking into  the coffin  the coffin  is bucking  and smoke  is coming  out of it  oh no  it pops up  pause that  oh my  that did not just  happen  that did not just  happen  ew  see it was the  lead singer  in the coffin  the whole time  and the lid pops up  just in time  for his vocal  and his fat ass  comes out of it  with his big perm  his eyes going 
[01:54:00]  bald perm  he is a fucking  smoke machine  at the graveyard  he has  a fucking  he's fat  with a balding  perm  he's horrid  please rewind  that a little  I want to see him  come out  because I didn't  think he could  come out of it  this guy rules  this wasn't  disappointing  thank you  whoever suggested  this  he could barely  fit in it  is what happened  he has a cross  and a cape  you gotta squeeze  out of the coffin  his mouth is opening 
[01:54:30]  too wide  for the words  big fat head  got one of those  metal crosses on  but he's making a fist  when he sings  he's very  into this  he needs conditioner  yeah  how's the voice  Lee Harvey Oswald  to apply it  voice isn't bad  as far as metal  goes  it's average  his outfit is awful  what's he wearing  like a monk belt 
[01:55:00]  it's a monk  a monk belt  he looks like  someone you'd see  at a Ren Faire  oh my god  it's Eddie Trunk  this is classic metal  he looks like Eddie  he's not in shape  no  he's got a beer belly  lead singers usually  don't have the beer belly  what's the alternative  for if he's gonna  put on some spandex  this is probably  the smartest  the monk outfit  it's covering up  some shit  his corny movements  and metal 
[01:55:30]  like metal arms  in the air  metal arms  oh there's Kevin Bacon  playing guitar  who's that  compared to some  of the shit  I saw on VH1 Classic  this isn't even that bad  he has hair like  Tony Montana's sister  I wish someone  would solve  his dilemma  the same way  so do I  do you want to  fuck me in my coffin  Tony  oh who's the chick  I don't know  she has the mysterious  like hood  yeah yeah  she's just horrified 
[01:56:00]  because the singer's  now singing right  at her face  and he's singing to her  oh  this guy stinks on ice  it's Juan Epstein  he looks  it's fat  he kind of looks  like John C. Reilly  the hot girl  on the cape  is running away  look at this  I've done C. Reilly  with a fucking  metal wig  oh the chick  she's scared 
[01:56:30]  oh boy  she's running in the snow  oh this is so  you gotta run in the snow  bad  you're a metal man  oh is he terrible  she's bewitched  by the way  it's a 7 minute  and 35 second video  holy shit  it's epic  dude this is the greatest  thing I've ever seen  it really is good  I'll watch the whole  thing later  what year was that  Danny  candle  what are they called  that's all 80s shit  candle mass  I'm gonna go 87 
[01:57:00]  on that  he puts the ass  in candle mass  let me say it  hi to Ryan  in Indiana  Ryan  what's going on guys  hey  I discovered  something yesterday  on YouTube  that is outstanding  somebody took  the  revolution of dance  the what  they took  the devil  by Van Halen  and they just  isolated the vocals  took away all the music  it is outstanding  so it's just  David Lee Roth's vocals  how do we find this  we've played that before 
[01:57:30]  let's play it again  I don't remember  I don't remember that either  I don't remember it  I definitely recall that  yeah  was it on YouTube  easy find  probably  because we made that  observation  so long ago  that David Lee Roth  just talked his way  through every song  he never really sang  Helen stinks  dance the night away  yeah  really  really  yeah  how about we don't  how about we don't  dance the night away  you guys will remember 
[01:58:00]  this I think  alright  I honestly  oh  oh yes  I don't remember this  Danny  I don't either  just  yeah  that's funny  I live my life  like there's  no tomorrow  and all I've got  I had to steal 
[01:58:30]  least I don't need  to beg or borrow  yes I'm living  at a base that kills  it's not bad  there's nothing wrong  about it  it's funny  the screams  but  you isolate anyone  they sound like  jerks  sounds silly  it's actually not bad  though  I'll tell you all 
[01:59:00]  about it  I found the simple  life  it's so simple  when I jumped out  on that road  this is the actual  tracks from the album  no love  it sounds exactly like  ain't got nobody  waiting at home  this is definitely  studio  this is a lot  yeah  god damn it baby  no I ain't lying to you  I'm only gonna tell you 
[01:59:30]  one time  that's funny  I love it  yes I am  sounds good  yeah  yeah this is fine  I mean  yeah  nothing wrong with that  you put the music behind  it's fucking  yeah  I think what we did  with it was  we just  we took  I mean obviously  him singing this  mind  can you isolate  we're back  that was a good one  better than ever  yeah they put that 
[02:00:00]  that was someone's  great idea  I hate that sound  you know  I found the simple  life  wasn't so simple  no  when I jumped out  on that road  yeah that's the track  got no love  no love  you'd call me off  got nobody  waiting at home 
[02:00:30]  damn  oh god  oh god  I'm running  oh yeah  wow  really  run on one more time  oh okay  we're so predictable  Travis wrote that  we played this  exactly two years 
[02:01:00]  ago today  why would we  bring this up  today  wow  I wonder how we  I'd love to hear how  we handled this two  years ago  we're uh 
[02:01:30]  we're looking at it  right now  that's probably exactly  did Iraq make a  mistake  what  what  Iraq was supposed  to have it  oh  wait what do you  mean  Iraq  hold on  let me  oh Iraq  that's just not  even  out of nowhere  a nagel appears  the show swerves to  avoid it but there's  no hope  the nagel is just  too big and has  made too many  mistakes  the hosts  scramble to get  a hold of the  situation  that's great 
[02:02:00]  a nagel  I hope he becomes  a friend of the  show  he's in New York  for a while  he should come by  again  a nagel appears  we also noticed  uh  they were uh  cutting out  uh  the little faggot  with the earring  and the makeup  the little faggot  that's his own hair  money for nothing  yeah  who was he singing  about  was it boy george  I have no idea  because he was  he was making fun  of mtv in general 
[02:02:30]  yeah yeah yeah  uh  and uh  was it a boy george  thing  I'm not sure  all I know is  they played it  this weekend  on uh  vh1 classics  and they didn't  just bleep out  faggot or anything  they cut that  entire uh  verse out  so we're gonna  make believe that  word never existed  I guess  yeah yeah  just like the n-word  and a few others  have made that  short list for now  but they  I heard about  Canada when they  did that  to the song  in Canada  but  but they're  cutting it out  in something  that already  happened  yeah  and we all 
[02:03:00]  remember it  if you're gonna  watch vh1  classic  and what  and I don't  think anyone  had a problem  with money for  nothing for the  last 25 years  I really don't  remember any  outrage over that  song but out of  nowhere they  decided well  let's uh  let's do the right  thing get rid of  that word  one complaint  I heard they got  a complaint  one  and in Canada  like we're very  bad with sex  here and we're  very PC here  the CBC  though is  even worse  really  they're worse  than the FCC  because it's not  just profanity 
[02:03:30]  it's words that  people might find  offensive  and it's not  it's not a self  policing  like you  couldn't get in  trouble from the  FCC by saying  faggot  or even nigger  I don't think  I think the  advertisers would  give you shit  and your  management might  but the FCC  wouldn't get  involved  but in Canada  if you said  nigger or faggot  the government  gets involved  yeah which is  amazing to me  which is just  I mean I like  Canada  but their  broadcast system  sucks 
[02:04:00]  yeah  they just  it's fucking  unbelievable  completely sanitized  they're not  under our  little constitution  there  do they have  a freedom of  speech  I mean I don't  know  they have the  human rights  stuff  which they  really don't  deal with  they're the  ones  that's the  same country  where the  comedian got  in trouble  for insulting  the woman  oh god  hold on a minute  oh it's three  years ago  three years ago  we did this  exact David Lee  Rothman  Kevin in  Houston  Kevin 
[02:04:30]  hey good  morning boys  I just  warned the  letter by  notes  January  20th  through  22nd  Jim Norton  at Cap  City Comedy  Club  Saturday  at the  8pm  show  oh good  thank you  80s on 8  has been  playing the  edited version  of that  song  for as  long as  I've had  X now  yeah 80s on 8  though is like  they're milk toast  they don't put  anything bad in  there  yeah but  oh I know  it's stupid  it's kind of  dumb I mean  because no one  ever had a 
[02:05:00]  problem with  the song  why are you  addressing  problems that  aren't there  you know what I  mean  I know  heard that song  a million times  never even thought  twice of  the word  yeah that was a  lyric  we have it  here on  who sings this  that's a 
[02:05:30]  that's all  it's a good song  cut the whole line  out  isn't he making  fun of the people  that used the word  in that lyric  in a way  yeah  like  look at that  faggot  and then  and he's basically  saying well that  faggot has his own  jet airplane  yeah I think he is  actually saying  I think he's actually  mocking people  you're right  he's mocking people  that use the word  if you watch the video  it's the computer  that's computer  animation  oh my god  square people  it's like square people  and it was the big fat guy  that didn't understand  anything  right  like he's looking at  the MTV 
[02:06:00]  and he's like  look at that  look at that  like he doesn't  understand it  that was the first  time I listened  how that word  was used  and he's actually  mocking people  that say look at  that faggot  yeah  oh my  ridiculous  well  he's actually  sticking up  for the faggot  faggot  look how  I remember  how cutting edge  that was  the square  and by the way  this is Martha Quinn  let me tell you  this was all done  on a super computer  did she say that  like wow  yeah like it was 
[02:06:30]  really like  look at that  look at the polygons  this is terrible  do you listen  to the old MTV  DJs  occasionally  on  we got Martha Quinn  sounding exactly  the same  as she did  when we were  growing up  Alan Hunter  but I think  he calls himself  Al now  Al Hunter  oh is he  Al Hunter  okay  he sounds  exactly the same  yeah they all  do  nope  okay  sorry  Nina Blackwood 
[02:07:00]  throw cancer  yeah that's pretty  she sounds horrible  but the other two  sound great  and Mark Goodman  sounds exactly  the same  yeah  and then what  what's his name  is no longer  with us  JJ Jackson  we lost  we lost  the JJ  JJ Jackson  JJ  can I read this  that Travis  just handed us  sure  the complaint  in Canada  terrific  system he got  up there  Canada  the complaint  in Canada  came from  a single person  in the Atlantic  province of  Newfoundland  a woman 
[02:07:30]  identifying  herself  a woman  identifying  herself  as a member  of the  LGBT  community  it's funny  how people  who don't  like labels  lesbian  gay  trans  bisexual  transgender  whatever the  fuck  in her  complaint  about  faggot  to the  broadcast  council  the  unidentified  of course  listener  wrote  the word  carries  an unavoidable  connotation  of hate  by airing it  unapologetically  on the radio  this station  is indirectly  propagating  hate  although I 
[02:08:00]  can see  the value  in timeless  classic rock  songs in  its original  form  I cannot  help but  feel that  it does  not  overshadow  the importance  of ending  discrimination  that'll work  it's a very  very nice  way of saying  that you  should be able  to say  what you  want  but since  you're  saying  something  I don't  like  here's  my reason  the council  agreed  like other  racially driven  words in  the English  language  faggot  is one  that  even if  entirely  or marginally 
[02:08:30]  accepted  in the early  days  is no longer  so  it ruled  the panel  finds that  it has  fallen into  the category  of unacceptable  designations  on the basis  of race  national or  ethnic origin  color religion  age gender  sexual orientation  marital status  or physical  or mental  disability  are you  shitting me  there's your  shit  freedom of  speech  for the  CBC  in Canada  let me  read that  list again  the panel 
[02:09:00]  finds that  it has  fallen into  the category  of unacceptable  designations  on the  basis of  race  national  or ethnic  origin  color  religion  age  gender  sexual  orientation  marital status  or physical  or mental  disabilities  that's  eleven  things  those  pussies  doesn't that  cover everything  in every song  like could fall 
[02:09:30]  into that category  will not let  you make  disparaging remarks  about  on the radio  what  pussies  what kind of  comedy  do they have  about  what fucking  you take all  those out  you don't have  comedy  wow is that  soft  not only is it  soft thinking  if you really  listen closely  he's fucking  sticking up  for the word  faggot  basically  no longer  acceptable  I guess  to make fun  because the  panel  what 
[02:10:00]  fucking  the panel  has decided  what you should  hear  that's great  I love when  Canadians  criticize the  US  and look  again  I really  do love  Canada  but this  one part  of your  government  why would  you love  Canada  because I  performed up  there enough  times and the  crowds are  actually good  so what  so if the  people enjoy  it then  that's  this segment  of their  government  but we're  heading that  way  yeah  we're heading  that way  slowly but  surely  yeah we'll  be right  with you  Canada  the panel  give us  another 10  years  we'll be 
[02:10:30]  talking about  this as  far as  the FCC  goes  talk about  people  needing  other people  to think  for them  I just  don't understand  that  people just  love to be  victims  and they love  to be part  of a  protected  group  wow  the underscore  Kirby  on Twitter  writes  the song's  lyrics are  written from  the point of  view of  working class  man  watching music  videos and  commenting on  what he sees  right  and then  Mark 
[02:11:00]  Knopfler  is saying  well that  little faggot  has his own  jet airplane  sticking up  for  that person  it's like  it's showing  the ignorance  of the fat  computer guy  right  not the fact  that you know  oh my god  look a faggot  got his own  jet airplane  right  really making  fun of  ignorance  in general  yeah  and I hear  Dire Straits  change the song  when they  perform that  song in  concert  why are  they  changing it  I'm being  corrected by  the little  white guy  the little 
[02:11:30]  white male  who can  just get  shit on  ad  nauseam  hold on  Johnny  Johnny  Everlove on  Twitter has  corrected me  maybe I'm  wrong  he said  the song  is not  banned  in Canada  and the  CBC  is a station  not a  governing body  I meant  that was my  misspeaking  I meant  to say  the  CRTC  he said  it's banned  by the  CBSC  not the  CRTC  which means  the song  can still  be played  on stations  regulated  by the 
[02:12:00]  CRTC  and it  has been  okay but  who has  banned  the song  yeah  who banned  it then  this is  a story  it went  to account  the council  I think  an actual  radio station  but they  don't have  a lot  of radio  stations  up there  the broadcast  council  I'm sorry  it's not  okay my  mistake  it's not  a government  body  it's made  up of  about 760  radio and  TV stations  across Canada  it's an  example of  a private  industry  regulating  itself  you know  what  I was  wrong  it's  exactly  what the  radio  stations  here do  where the 
[02:12:30]  stations  don't have  a body  like that  but they  will go  you can't  say this  you can't  you know  the way  they were  policing  us  so I  was  my  apologies  I was  wrong  I didn't  know that  so the  it's being  banned  the same  way radio  stations  told us  don't do  Asian  accents  that's  what that  is  okay  my fault  well Eric  in Miami  writes  okay then  we'll just  stick to  cocksucker  you might  have to do  something with 
[02:13:00]  that song  after the  show  maybe we  should  you know  we gotta  be PC  you know  it's a new  world  so if you  could take  that song  and maybe  you know  put another  phrase in  there  I would  appreciate it  because  faggot's  not good  anymore  we could  probably  come up  with some  better ways  to do  that song  yeah sure  I got a few  that come to  mind  I guess  we could do  a few  different versions  see what  works best  well it's a big  story so we  really should  clean that song 
[02:13:30]  up for everybody  keep everyone  happy  classic  VH1 though  I go there  every once in a  while  yeah you know  I was checking  it out  that was after  we were just  laughing at  fucking  infomercials  which is  there is an  infomercial  for a penis  pump  yeah  and it's  a full  half hour  infomercial  for a  posty vac  the posty vac  and  it's  it's the  dumbest  commercial

[02:42:00]  it's like a  trachoma  and and it  was uh  about the size  of a basketball  what  hanging off  of his leg  no it looked  like it looked  like when he  when he was in  shorts it looked  like his ball  bag was giant  and hanging out  of the leg of  his shorts  and he could  barely walk  and he got to  lose it  but it wasn't  attached to his  ball bag  it just happened  on his thigh  dude maybe that's  what the guy that  sells books on  columbus avenue has  that's what they  say a lot of these  people have that  he's not a fat  guy but he has  he looks like  he has one  giant ball 
[02:42:30]  and he's been  around so long  he just smokes  cigars on  columbus avenue  and sells his  shitty books  and his old  like playboys  and shit  and a detachable  penis  yeah and he  doesn't  because he  got it  the kiosk  he doesn't  cover it up  he'll talk  to you about  books while  he has this  massive fucking  something happening  in his parents  yeah this was  really like  disgusting to  watch  this guy went  out and got  I think  six bacon  cheeseburgers  at the drive  through  and then like  a double  chicken nugget 
[02:43:00]  things  and then he  goes back to  his room  lays down on  his stomach  in bed  and just eats  what's the  point of the  show  no point  that's the  whole point  is that there's  no point  it's no prizes  no nothing  they just have  to lose weight  or die  that's pretty  much what they  said the point  is so they  don't die  I love how  the trainer  just shows up  with his shirt  off  oh yeah  making these  guys feel  real good about  themselves  he's all ripped  and the chick  trainer showed up  just looking all  buff and shit  right  and the fat

[02:47:30]  the uh  blood cells  uh  they form  uh  this fatty  lipoma  but you're  forgetting though  there can be  leakage  and if it's  drained properly  the leakage  won't interfere  with your daily  exactly  that's exactly  right  Jimmy  exactly  yeah  yeah  do you know  I actually thought  that was Dr. Steve  making fun of himself  in the beginning  great job  I really thought  it was you  great job  hey Queen Elizabeth  on the Twitter

[02:53:00]  what happened  because the cuts  were too pronounced  so yeah  it does say here  in the description  that it's from  a very real video  called Uranus  self anal massage  for men  and then it says  that this is  his remix  of the video  but I mean  we could keep  going with this  it's the same guy  but this guy  was serious  yeah  no he's serious  Derek was just  telling me  that he looked up  his name  he's got some  books on Amazon  got some cred  yeah apparently  maybe we should  just see the  original  yeah maybe  we should try  and find it  yeah I want  to see the  original video 
[02:53:30]  yeah yeah  yeah  instead of  this guy's  interpretation  of it  original  yeah  ladies and  gentlemen  Jay Mars  hey Jay  oh my gosh  I want all  those videos  it sounds  fantastic  sounds wonderful  sounds fun  hey you might  have a chance  at Regis's job  he just announced  he's retiring  at the end  of the summer  I gotta step down  I can't do it  as good as Anthony  Anthony always  Anthony always says  my name is Regis  and literally  as I was on hold  listening to that  I said  I hope he says  Jay Ball  coming up 
[02:54:00]  Jay Ball  love how energetic  he gets when he  says your name  he can't wait for you  he's super fired up  Notre Dame graduate  every time you meet him  he's like  you know I went to  Notre Dame  oh god everybody  knows that  we know  Regis  enough  so did anybody  catch the  Notre Dame game  it was fantastic  they won  dadgum it  you're a good  impressionist Anthony  oh please  coming from the  Jay Moore  the Jay Moore  nice islanders  Opie  well I got my 
[02:54:30]  jets though  Opie tweeted a photo  Opie tweeted himself  throwing his islander  tickets in the East River  the funniest thing  I've ever seen  like she's literally  thousands of dollars  I'd rather them  just float out  into Brooklyn Harbor  better than  yeah  going to Carolina  one more time  better than going  and stupid people  are pissed off  they're like  give it to a kid  or something  maybe I'm giving  the rest of my  tickets to some people  so go fuck yourself  and it was $600  that I just threw  in the river  what am I going to do  they were out of it  in November 
[02:55:00]  they were done  they're really horrible  and you know  it's amazing  I was looking at  the NHL standings  and like the entire  NHL is 500 above  like literally  the entire  three-fourths  of the NHL  is all 500  the last place  team in three  divisions  are like  21 and 19  and then you get  OB's team  they have like  two wins  well the devil  the San Jose Sharks  are in last place  they're 21 and 19  well the devils  are worse  and I think we're  because we had a little 
[02:55:30]  bit of a winning streak  and then the Edmonton Oilers  I guess are kind of  right around where  the Islanders are  but now the Islanders  are in trouble  because  or people are  suspicious  because they sat  DiPietro  even though he's healthy  and put in a rookie  goalie  and now everyone's like  oh they're playing  for their draft pick  they're playing to be  you know  the number one draft pick  they always pan out  right  yeah exactly  don't you think  it's funny  when the original  Canadian teams  are in last place  like when Calgary  Edmonton  I mean Vancouver  is great now 
[02:56:00]  but when all the  original Canadian teams  are in last place  you're like  oh my gosh  you guys invented this  what are you doing  yeah it's your sport  you shouldn't  be there  hey hey  what about the Jets  there JJ  bro  that was unbelievable  not even Brian  Schottenheimer  could ruin it  for the Jets  you know  I always say  Brian Schottenheimer  is the worst person  on the Jets  and I don't know  if you  I know you saw the game  I was reading your tweets  but it seemed like  Mark Sanchez  and Schottenheimer  were jawing a lot  on the sidelines  Schottenheimer 
[02:56:30]  I mean  Sanchez was telling  Schottenheimer  like no you're wrong  I'm not running that  I'm not running that  they had one time  when they went into  the wildcat  with Antonio Holmes  and Mark Sanchez  looked like he was going  to smash Schottenheimer  in the face  with his helmet  on the sidelines  like why am I  on the sidelines  in a playoff game  so somebody else  could take a snap  that wasn't a quarterback  for a national championship team  so that's good  wow  you know what  I didn't even notice that  and the touchdown  to LaDainian Tomlinson  was a Mark Sanchez audible  he saw the linebacker 
[02:57:00]  coming up into the box  to fill the box up  there was eight in the box  and he saw the three receivers  trips left  and he knew that  if Tomlinson went  for the little flare  off to the left  he knew that  that linebacker  would get caught up  in the wash  he wasn't going to be able  to get over there in time  that was a Sanchez call  they got to stop  getting tricky  they always mess it up  with a double reverse  or some stupid wildcat  like I hope Brad Smith  stays on the injured  so they can't direct snap  and have him run  one yard up the middle  behind Nick Mangold's  rear end again  and you know what  this is why  Jay Moore 
[02:57:30]  fills in for Jim Rome  oh I know  this is why you fill in  for Jim Rome  right here  where's Jimmy  I'm right here buddy  Jimmy's here  hey  what about  Steelers obviously  it's going to be a tough game  what's your thoughts  real fast  I don't know how you pick  against the Jets  at this point  you beat Peyton Manning  and Shannon Sharpe  when he said  blee blah blah  and I said  you know what  he's got a point  we beat Peyton  and Brady on the road  that's unbelievable  did you see 
[02:58:00]  after the game  when they were all  sitting there  it was Boomer  and Shannon Sharpe  and Bill Cowher  you know  the after game  the after part  yeah  and Shannon Sharpe  said  blah blah blah  and I said  this guy  has a point  and I don't know  who  has a point  I don't know  who came down  from the NFL  and said  everyone  I want your ties  I want your nuts  so thick  that you could go  sailing with your shirts  like Merrill Hodge 
[02:58:30]  and Shannon Sharpe  they're not  they're like the size  of a pillow  around their neck  what's wrong  with these guys  classic  skinny tie  like Anthony  like hey  nothing  classic  I don't see  how the Jets  could be afraid  of anybody  at this point  except maybe  Jimmy's Cowboys  yay  what about  the Packers  though man  fuck  the Packers  beat the Jets  9-0  the Packers  got three field  holes on the Jets  it's going to be  the Jets  and the Packers  and it's going to be  two sixth seeds  in the Super Bowl  and yet  it'll be the highest 
[02:59:00]  rated Super Bowl  it's fantastic  yeah  I feel like  a little girl  a little girly  did you see Rex Ryan  running down the sidelines  like Rex  don't do that  it looks  it really  you know  I have a  it was funny  I have a very  school problem  like I've had  colonoscopies  and stuff  and that's how  I run  when I'm going  to have diarrhea  when I'm rocketing  you who  that's mine  he stole that  oh Jesus  with milk 
[02:59:30]  milk  lemonade  round the corner  that's mine  whoopty doo  whoopty  the best part  is the whoopty doo  every time  whoopty doo  he looked like  it looked like  one of those games  where one team  is so far ahead  they let the retarded  kid run a play  that's what he looked  like running down  the field  but fucking J  nailed it  it looks like  he's got fucking  diarrhea  he's trying to  keep it  he's got the piles  you fucking  nailed it  at sports center  they go  and a very  special play  from a very  special young man  in an amazing 
[03:00:00]  display of  sportsmanship  the New York Jets  let Rex Ryan  run down  Sean Green  taking a  putting the baby  to sleep  and laying down  in the end zone  was worth  every 45 feet  of that penalty  so pumped  there's not  I was saying  yesterday  that's exactly  and Jim Nance  acted holier  than Alec  that is a  terrible display  of sportsmanship  no Jim  we just made  the Patriots  and Tom Brady  and Bill Belichick  go home  they have to 
[03:00:30]  literally unpack  a minute and 15  seconds from now  that's exactly  when you take  that 15 yard penalty  that was such  annoying  pontificating  was that Jim Nance  who said that  like what a douche  he's the worst  I love  oh my  I've never seen  such a classless  no it's not  Ocho Cinco  in week 5  and you're still  down 77  going into the  parking lot  with Pom Pom  doing river dance  you just took  Tom Brady  and sent him  to Milan  with Giselle 
[03:01:00]  hey someone  does read my tweets  thank you sir  that's right buddy  boy  fucking A  that's hilarious  I don't need  class in sports  we talk about this  on the show  all the time  who the fuck  needs class  in sports  and who is  some faggot  sportscaster  to decide  what's classy  for guys  who are playing  at that moment  right  Jimmy I don't  know why  that kind of  language  doesn't make  you seem  older  I know  but sometimes  I feel cool  when I say  faggot  and people  think I smoke  I didn't say  that it make  you seem cooler 
[03:01:30]  I said it make  you seem older  Jace  sit out at  Cunningham  Jace  it says you  want to talk  about  it says you  want to talk  about Ricky  Gervais  we did a  fine hour  on that  earlier  obviously  you loved  it right  I loved  it  but the  other thing  was  I have  I like  Robert Downey  Jr.  a lot  and as  someone  maybe  Jimmy  can sort  of get  with me  on this  like don't  smash  Robert Downey  Jr.  is like  the anti-low  hand  he's the  guy that  got it  together 
[03:02:00]  so to go  smash him  about like  being a  drunk  and all  that stuff  and like  meanwhile  you can't  host an  award show  without bringing  a cocktail  with you  like you  got some  stones  Gervais  I didn't  mind it  because again  it was  it was like  Downey has  had a lot  of trouble  with that  publicly  I think  if it was  a real  criticism  like I think  if Gervais  said in an  interview  you know  what  he's bad  for movies  because he  drinks and  does drugs  that would  be totally  different  but the fact  that he  goofed on  him  I didn't  mind  I didn't 
[03:02:30]  mind it  at all  the best  intro  actually  to me  was Tom  Hanks  and the  other one  Tim Allen  that was  funny  that was  amazing  you know  what  the best  part  okay  everyone  listen  this is  for real  speaking of  Ricky Gervais  February 4th  I'm going to  be at the  Bata  and February  5th I'm  going to be  at Foxwoods  and I'm  going to show  people how  to really do  jokes  without carrying  cocktails out  on the  playing field  because I  don't want 
[03:03:00]  Jim Nance  going  I've never  seen  someone so  hopeless  to bring  was he  drinking apple  juice  is he  pulling like  a Dean  Martin  it didn't  look like  a beer  I don't know  what that was  it almost  looked like  a beer  yeah  Anthony would  totally walk  out with a  beer when  he's hosting  the AVN  award  Anthony you  are like  third in  line for  the AVN  award  I think  I'd do  more  maybe the  video game  awards or  something  hey that's 
[03:03:30]  my territory  back off  I know  I'm not  stepping on  your toes  don't step  on my toes  none for  you Mr.  Hitler  Buddy Hacker  once told me  like an  11 minute  joke  and it  went on  and on  and it  was just  about  some old  lady  taking like  she was  sitting with  Hitler at  a bus  stop and  there was  another guy  and she  took out  the sandwich  and she  like broke  off a piece  and she put  butter on it  and a little  mustard and a  little toasted  it was beautiful  and she added  some ham  from the  dead  like it  went on 
[03:04:00]  and on  like she  built this  sandwich for  like 11  minutes and  she gave a  piece of the  guy to her  left  and when I  say 11  minutes I  mean he  left like  as long as  we've been on  the phone so  far and  then the  punchline was  so stupid  but you're  so vested  in this joke  and the old  lady goes  none for  you Mr.  Hitler  that was  the entire  punchline of  the show  and you're  sitting there  like and  it's Buddy  Hackett and  you're in  his house  and there's  lots of  guns  he's like  the film  of comedy 
[03:04:30]  he's Phil  Spector of  comedy  I just read  a Buddy  Hackett story  where after  a gig he  went to a  restaurant and  they were  closed for  the night and  supposedly there  was a padlock  on the door  I forgot and  there were some  other comics  with him and  he pulled out  a gun and  shot the lock  to go inside  did he ever  tell you any  shooting stories  good old  days  yeah  so that's  true  when I  wanted to  get a gun  you know  you had to  wait like  I think in  California  you had to  wait like  six hours  because I  want to make  sure you're 
[03:05:00]  not a bad  guy  he lent  me a gun  to drive  home with  and then he  called the  sheriff's  department  in Beverly  Hills  Santa Monica  basically my  route home  he called  the head  and goes  I got  this guy  he's coming  driving home  he's got a  pistol  don't break  his chops  he's a good  friend  oh there'll be  a Nagasaki  where the  women  to the  bucky  and the  men  say  woo  that's  woo  that's  sounds  just like  him  knowing that  if I got  pulled over  they're gonna  go oh yeah  Buddy Hackett  told us  you had a  loaded weapon  yeah yeah  everything's cool 
[03:05:30]  Anthony here's  the part  you'll love  the pistol  was engraved  with a palm  tree  and it  said  to Buddy  Hackett  with love  the Florida  Sheriff's  Association  when you  have gun  engraved  on your  person  you've  never been  more tempted  to shoot  somebody  just because  that will  be the  murder weapon  yeah  exactly  but you're  not gonna  think it's  me  if I just  take a  service  robber  you know  an old  38  he's got a  palm tree  sitting it  like nice  and fancy 
[03:06:00]  yeah that  could be  I think  the evidence  overwhelming  they would  be taking  Buddy Hackett  away  Jimmy how  did you  guys  was that  a benefit  you guys  did it  Borgata  no  no  it was  just  gay  how  did you  guys  split up  that kind  of dough  you had  four monsters  on stage  yeah  I mean  it actually  wasn't that  hard  I mean  it was  a good  payday  for everybody  I mean  we did  three shows  how's that  oh  there you go  three shows  oh yeah  yeah  okay good  um 
[03:06:30]  I do a minimum  if you were to pay one of the comics least  what's that  less  if you were to pay one of the four comics less  strictly based  let's hold on one second  let's get a little closer  so we're not banging the ball up the doors  okay hon  thanks buddy  what's that about  we're playing basketball indoors  but when you miss  and it hits the garage door  it shakes the whole house  a couple  name  folks  I picked up  if you had to pay one of the comics less 
[03:07:00]  based on their performance that night  who would have gotten a little less in their checks  jeez  hard to say  because we all gave 110%  I mean you know how I say it Jay  we all left it out there on the stage  we did three shows  we all did really well  all right  but if you had to pay one guy  a little less  based on crowd response  unfortunately it would have to be myself  Jimmy had to take the bullet 
[03:07:30]  he doesn't want to answer that  Jimmy can run for  you can run for  you're the best  he took the bullet  none for you Mr. Christine  he just did not  he just fucking took the bullet  I'm gonna get my son dressed  and take him to school  but I thought  I gotta call the boys  it's been a while  we'll talk about Ricky Gervais  and I had two things to plug  you know  I'll take advantage of the plug time  might as well  and Jay on Twitter  where are you at  did you change 
[03:08:00]  you got rid of the 37 right  who cares  no I'm the same  but it's just  it's a tower of babble  who cares  it is  you're right  all it is  who's actually reading our shit  it really is just an invention  for strangers to tell you directly  you suck  yeah  that's a very good point  blocking people really is  one of the closest  blocking  you gotta get closer than that  blocking people really is  one of life's  sublime pleasures  the block  gotta love the block  you know the thing like  if a tree falls in the woods  and no one's there to hear it 
[03:08:30]  did it really fall  it's like  if you block someone on Twitter  did they really ever exist  in their mom's basement  do they really even exist  nope  if you block them  are they  yeah then they  they can't  they can't get to  any number of people  so it doesn't fucking matter  it's great  goodbye  I got blocked by Jason Whitlock  and then I felt  I was so offended  because I love him  he's a racist  who's Jason Whitlock  exactly  called him a racist  come down to see my show

[03:12:30]  I never got the link  so if someone could help  me out with that today  so we could retweet that  we'll pop that up  always trying to help  the cop  the cop's family  that's awful  that  it's horrible  on the heels of that  you got the Camden  the Camden Police Department  getting cut by 50%  who the fuck  is going to Camden  ah  it's just going to be great  that's today right  yeah  they lose half their police force  about half their police force  and if that's an area  that needs cops  that doesn't make any sense  what's that about  budgets  the state  budgets  they're just like 
[03:13:00]  yeah we're out of money  let's cut the police department  in half  where the fuck is the money  I know it's a broken record  but where the fuck  is the money going  where now you got to  lose half your police force  very important thing  so  we're all still  we're all paying  our fucking taxes  very important  for most of us  where the fuck  is the money  not going to  half the police  that were there  yesterday  you know how much  money it is  just to drive  from AC  back to New York  yeah  come on  where's all this  money going  don't question it  though man  you'll get that  food poisoning 
[03:13:30]  that takes you out  conspiracy  so yeah  that happens today  and we talked about  Willie O'Ree  the first black NHL player  yeah  debuted for the  Boston Bruins  53 years ago  the fuck did he do  for the team  I could say things  for a while  you're going to like  this statement Ant  I know you're going to  love this  but for a while  black guys in hockey  fighters  oh what  they put them out  there to goon it up  and now black guys  in hockey  starting to show 
[03:14:00]  some skills  besides the fighting  thing  am I wrong  there are a lot  of African  players  and African  descended players  in hockey  I won't say  African American  because you know  there's Canadians  all over the place  there's still just  a handful  literally just a  handful  I don't even think  every team has a  black guy yet  yeah  but I mean  it's  I like how  presumptuous the news  gets with that  they say like  African American  when they're 
[03:14:30]  describing somebody  it's like  no  how do you know  they're looking  for someone  sometimes they do  mention race  described as an  African American  male  it's like  I was from  Canada  an African American  could be  how do you know  why isn't a black  a white African  who now lives here  considered  it's just such  an African American  double talk  it doesn't  and anytime you watch  any cop shows  it's always  black male  describe it as  black male  don't try to get  fancy  one more 
[03:15:00]  one more Jets  story too  before we leave  a man celebrated  the Jets win  a lot of people  celebrating it  this guy though  decided to go  sledding down  his driveway  yeah I read  right into traffic  and he got killed  so  whoops  not the smartest  thing to do  I sled down  his driveway  is there snow  or is it just  now he's not  going to be able  to  now he won't  even know  if the Jets  make it to  the Super Bowl  what an asshole  because he's dead  that is a dumb 
[03:15:30]  ass thing to do  you can't even  feel bad for him  you're just like  good  what a dope  fucking  because a team  wins  you sled into  into traffic  Jets fans are  dumb  I'm sorry  hey  I mean I'm  generalized  he's case in  point  no but they  just are  they're just  why would you  do that  sports fans in  general are just  kind of silly  right  yeah  it really is  Jets fans  are worse  you think Jets fans 
[03:16:00]  are worse than  any of them  yes  no not really  yes  trying to think  of a sports team  that really has  horrible fans  just one that  really sticks out  Yankees  Yankees  Oakland  their fans  suck  I don't know  not even the  Yankees  Red Sox  no  Jets  I'm not saying  all Jets fans  but a lot of  them  they're the first  ones to start  yelling J-E-T-S  well that's the  chant  yeah but the team  hasn't won anything 
[03:16:30]  fly like airplanes  after touchdowns  the team hasn't  won  I like when they  fly like airplanes  on the field  they're shit talkers  but they haven't won  and that's what  bugs people about  the Jets  that's what it is  it's not that  they're gonna  but that's Rex Ryan's  thing  he's been like that  ever since the Jets  picked him up  it doesn't matter  why  I love his cockiness  he's a little out of  control at times  cockiness after you win  makes it fun  makes it fun  cockiness before you win  is silly  not really  that's what we're  talking about  let them be cocky 
[03:17:00]  all they want  before, during, after  working well for  Joe Namath  he was all cocky  beforehand  are they dragging  Joe Namath out  now that the Jets  have a real playoff  run going on  have we seen  Joe Namath yet  no I don't think  this week we'll start  seeing Joe Namath  but he was all  cocky though  back there in  16  yeah he was  guaranteed a win  the post put him  on that Star Wars  cover they did  did you see that  on Friday  what was the  headline again  return of the jet  I  you don't get it 
[03:17:30]  because they were  facing the evil  empire  apparently now  the Patriots  are the evil  empire along  with the Red Sox  right  yeah Joe Namath  I think he was  Yoda  was he Yoda  I think so  why would he be  Yoda  he predicted a win  yeah there's  Namath  there's Namath  as Yoda  I'm sure he  appreciates that  for everything he  did for the Jets  in this city  look completely  like an asshole  he's just waking  up getting his  paper  and now he's  Yoda  who else we got  in the helmet  that's Bill  Belichick  Bill Belichick  is the  Patriots  Darth Vader 
[03:18:00]  yeah  Rex Ryan  is Han Solo  I see  how stupid  who's the chick  look at  oh that's Rex's  wife  I love the gut  that's right  I haven't seen  her look that hot  because they put  her head on  on Princess Leia's  body  I love the gut  on Han Solo  yeah  that's the dumbest  thing I've ever  seen  see the Patriots  or the Death  Star  they did not  call that a  collectible  did they  of course  they did  and of course  it's our  collectible  cover  it's not  collectible 
[03:18:30]  I mean  I know  some  dumbbell  has it up  Montreal  Canadians  riot  when they win  in the first  round  oh yeah  they do  do they  really  oh yeah  yeah they did  last year  when they beat  Washington  puddle of AIDS  C-A-R-S  cars  cars  cars  Jimmy  you're going  to Austin  this weekend  oh yes  Thursday  Friday  Saturday  the Cap
