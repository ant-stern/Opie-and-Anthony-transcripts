<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with commercials, followed by a bizarre segment featuring a song made entirely of "toodly-doo" sounds.  The hosts then discussed roadside memorials—white spray-painted bicycles—for traffic accident victims, debating a caller, Samantha, who supported them, while the hosts joked about vandalism.  Opie detailed a disastrous trip to Rochester, including an airport delay, a cramped flight with an overweight passenger and an unpleasant flight attendant, and turbulent flight conditions.

The conversation shifted to the funeral of Opie's friend, "Dr. Fon," who died from alcohol abuse. Opie recounted anecdotes from the funeral, including touching his friend's arm in the open casket, and shared uncomfortable jokes about the event.  The hosts discussed death and the afterlife, with caller Jason contributing a morbid funeral anecdote about a detached arm. The show then covered the devastating Oklahoma tornado, focusing on its scale, damage, and casualties, including graphic details of victims' injuries.  Several news clips highlighting the event’s intensity were played.

This discussion continued into a subsequent segment, with callers sharing their experiences and the hosts commenting on the tornado's power, the media's coverage, and the advancements in weather forecasting. A caller joked about President Obama banning wind power.  The hosts also discussed a reporter’s emotional interview and a video showing an elderly woman reunited with her dog.  A discussion about an upcoming podcast episode featuring older show bits was interjected. This segment also included a profanity-laced argument with a listener.

A following segment heavily featured music videos by Trinidad James and 2 Chainz, with studio guest Troy providing commentary.  The hosts and Troy analyzed the videos, focusing on the frequent use of the n-word, fashion choices, and the overall “over-the-top” nature of the videos. The conversation branched out to a planned road trip (potentially including Branson, Missouri, and Austin, Texas), a negative movie review, upcoming screenings of "This is the End," criticism of a TV show, listener calls, and plugs for their podcast and Dollar Shave Club.  There was extended discussion of Lil Wayne and Penn Jillette, with negative comments about the latter.  The segment was punctuated by frequent use of offensive language, particularly the n-word.

The show continued with more commercials, followed by the "F.U. Line" segment, featuring angry and vulgar messages.  The hosts discussed ice cream sandwiches and podcast download numbers before Troy Kwan entered the studio, revealing he had defecated himself while wearing bright underwear.  A lengthy, graphic discussion of the incident ensued, joined by Dr. Steve, who discussed potential parasitic infection from Troy’s recent trip to Mexico.  The conversation delved into graphic details about parasites, their appearance under a microscope, and potential treatments.  The hosts also discussed medical terms and urban legends, incorporating vulgar humor.

A later segment began with a caller’s description of a grotesque buttock abscess, prompting humorous suggestions. Dr. Steve discussed the medical condition and was connected to Dr. Rochester. The hosts then discussed a listener’s wife's alleged natural breast implants and promoted Dr. Steve's podcast, "Weird Medicine."  Troy offered to record his bowel movements.  More commercials followed, including Dollar Shave Club and Adam & Eve.  Music from Uriah Heep was played, leading to a discussion of the band and news items, including comments by Sergio Garcia and Jon Bon Jovi.  The conversation continued to include vulgar and sexually explicit language, discussions of bodily functions, and other taboo topics. The segment ended with further banter about Troy Kwan’s bowel issues, imagined scenarios involving parasites, and plugs for the Opie and Anthony podcast.

Finally, the after-show segment featured a phone call with "Lady Di," focusing on her unemployment, homelessness, and unproductive lifestyle.  The hosts questioned her about past experiences, including a firing from ShopRite, and delved into sexually explicit territory, including discussions about her sexual activity during homelessness.  They repeatedly referenced a man she was involved with who may have committed suicide (per a text message from Anthony Cumia).  An anecdote about meeting Ron Jeremy was shared, followed by text messages from Anthony Cumia and Justin Stangle.  The segment ended with a discussion of Lady Di's possible return to the show and brief advice for a caller. Several commercial breaks were interspersed throughout.

[00:04:00]  You can say, I toodly-doo  But I'm not the only toodly-doer  Toot, toot, toodly, toodly-doo 
[00:04:30]  And there you have it, the toodly-toot song of the day  I love the toodly-doo  Yeah, this is the OVDNP Show  On the corner of Wilshire and Santa Monica  Where they met, there was all these flowers  And somebody had a bicycle that they had spray-painted the whole thing white 
[00:05:00]  I guess somebody got killed on a bicycle  There's one in Brooklyn, a bike, it's chained to a sign  It's spray-painted white for a girl I got hit by a truck  Why don't you just put the corpse out there?  Yeah, at least we can touch it  I literally got like, it was like seeing a ghost  Yeah, why do we have to be depressed because you lost a loved one?  If you do that, you know how many guys in Chelsea would have like little crucifixes hanging around their asses?  Oh, wow  Wow, this got evil real quick 
[00:05:30]  It certainly did  Craig on Long Island, Craig  Out in the Rockaways, I'm driving on Shorefront Parkway, whatever the hell it is  And it has one of those bikes  All spray-painted white  I had never heard of the bike thing, the white bike thing  It was like one of those little girly bikes  But they spray-painted white because I guess the kid's in heaven now?  Completely white  Only allow white bikes underneath it  And people  In heaven  I'm just like, I don't need to see this  All right  It's like heaven's going to be a great place  Oh, come on 
[00:06:00]  Oh, sorry  I want to steal one of those bikes and then just ride it around  Ride it around that stupid ghost bike  Oh, that'd be great for Halloween  Yeah  Steal one of those bikes  There's Jimmy riding the all-white bike and it says, we miss you, Ashley, on the back  Ooh  I'm making these ghost noises  Ooh  Driving their house  Oh, what a creep  Dude, you should steal one of the bikes and then you dress up as the guy who got run over  Oh  No, you just chain your bike to it on the side and then run it to the store 
[00:06:30]  This memorial now has like your kickstand scratching it  Bicycle rack, put a bike rack there  Just shove his bike in there  God, I want to steal that bike so badly and then just ride it  Going boo  Just ride it in circles going, ha-ha  Samantha, what's up?  Nothing, I was just calling to make a comment about  You know, the roadside memorabilia  I think that it's a good thing  I think that it's a reminder to people who are out there driving  Maybe driving drunk, making stupid decisions, driving fast 
[00:07:00]  That this is what can happen  And it doesn't only affect those people  It affects other people  No, you're wrong  You're wrong  No, it doesn't affect the families  It's creepy  Once you're dead, you're dead  The family gets over it  Thank you  I would love to know  I would love to know how many crashes were caused because someone was looking at the roadside memorial going, what the?  Wait, what, Samantha? What did you ask? I'm sorry  I said, well, you really love your family then, don't you?  Because I know if my family member was deceased because of a drunk driver, I don't think I would be too happy about that 
[00:07:30]  I don't mind  But would you build a...  Yeah, we'd spray paint something white and make everybody else look at it  Spray paint a bunch of whiskey bottles and put it there  You spray paint a bar with laughing patrons  Shut up and let us laugh  We're having a laugh, Sammy  Hold on a second  Sammy?  Hold on a second, Sammy with an eye and a little heart dotting it  We're having a good chuckle over the drunk driving death thought  Memorial  Memorial 
[00:08:00]  Now get back to your point, what were you saying?  Shut up  I was just saying that I think it's a good thing in a way  We know you do, a little white thing spray painted all over  Shut up  I've seen a white bike spray painted, so I mean, I don't, I can't say  But yet you're commenting  But yet you're, good point, Bill, good point  Alright, who'd you lose in your family, Samantha?  Huh?  Who got hit? Who'd you lose?  I did, but I've lost six friends in drunk driving accidents  That's a lot of spray accidents  Jesus  Yeah, in a three year period of time  Were they the drunk ones? 
[00:08:30]  In one case, the three of them were driving and the one kid was drunk  But in the other case, it was a drunk driver who hit my friend's car and flipped them  And they, all three of them died  Yeah  That's three families that lost a member of their family because of somebody else's irresponsibility  You know what, Sam?  Does anybody remember Alaska?  That's terrible, I'm sorry  What?  I just don't think that there's anything wrong with putting a cross up on the side of the road  I know you don't, but you know what, Sam? 
[00:09:00]  Let me take lemons and make lemonade here  I mean, I know it's really sad for the families and stuff like that  But that extra money at Christmas can be put towards other things  Right  Just because they're deceased doesn't mean that they were never your family  Oh, I was kidding  You still have to have a family  Oh my God  Way to just bum out everybody  You want to take your funny bone and spray paint it white and put it somewhere  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for  Today's O.P. and Anthony show starts now 
[00:09:30]  Today's O.P. and Anthony show starts now  Thank you  Our O.P. and Anthony show starts now  Today's O.P. and Anthony show ends  Thank you. 
[00:10:00]  Thank you. 
[00:10:30]  Thank you. 
[00:11:00]  Thank you. 
[00:11:30]  Thank you. 
[00:12:00]  Thank you. 
[00:12:30]  That is not good. 
[00:13:00]  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  If you're not going to find this, that's it.  Just don't listen.  But my guess is, you'll be sticking around.  Let's do this.  It's going down.  Jack.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM's satellite radio.  This is good radio right here.  Y'all are cooler and shit.  It starts funny and it gets very uncomfortable.  One of the most popular shows in the world.  Radio journalism at its best.  Hello, kids. 
[00:13:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  They swear and they're vulgar and they talk about awful, awful things.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Very flavorful.  Yay.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Please welcome Opie.  This show is twisted.  I'm telling you, we're enjoying this shit.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Anthony.  I want dick crisis.  I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you, ladies.  Remember that.  That's what you like, isn't it?  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, he would say, die.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear is real. 
[00:14:00]  Clean your heart.  Clean your heart.  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Morning.  Woo.  Hi.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:14:30]  Yes.  The Opie and Anthony program.  Yep.  We had a nice little, well.  You had a nice day off.  It was nice for me.  I guess, you know, probably fun for Jimmy.  I kind of had a nice day off.  It was nice to see old friends.  Yeah.  For the people that don't know, a good friend of mine from the old days, a fraternity brother  of mine died.  The old days.  Died.  Yeah.  I lost touch with him in the last, you know, bunch of years.  Was it like one of those movies where everyone gets together and one of the old friends dies 
[00:15:00]  and you talk about things?  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Like my phone blew up in the last week.  Oh, my God.  Are you okay?  From people I haven't talked to in, you know, I'll sit, like 20 years.  Wow.  But, and then I'm just talking to them like we never went our own ways.  Yeah.  It's weird how that shit happened.  Big time.  So I got some...  Are you talking about like grades?  No, no.  Oh, see, I thought...  No, we weren't about grades. 
[00:15:30]  I brag about my college education, but, man, I skated.  Yeah.  I fucking figured out all sorts of shortcuts to get through that shit because I knew the  classroom for me was a waste of time.  I was up there to partay.  You needed practical hands-on experience.  Yeah, the Opster was there to party and to learn the craft of radio.  The Opster?  Did anyone call you the Opster?  Hey, look, it's the Opster.  No, I got a lot of Greggs and a lot of Opies.  Oh. 
[00:16:00]  Not any, no Opsters.  Oh, damn.  Gotta get that flying up there.  I know.  Oh, by the way, for the people that fly, it's a fucking nightmare out there.  What's going on?  Because of the sequester, they fucking got rid of some air traffic control guys or something?  Yeah, apparently they've cut back on TSA and air traffic control.  I was in the Rochester airport for a total of three hours yesterday.  And when I tell you if you're in the Rochester airport for five minutes, it's too long. 
[00:16:30]  Wow.  There's absolutely nothing to do.  Yeah.  You know, like Newark, they have like a little sushi bar.  They got all sorts of shit going on.  Hang out at a little pub.  You almost feel like you're at a mall.  Yeah.  Not Rochester.  Oh, my.  There was a Hudson News and a fake Starbucks and a McDonald's, I think.  I think that's all I saw.  There is nothing to do.  So I'm just walking, just pacing, walking down the hallways. 
[00:17:00]  And this was after I got the phone alert that my flight was going to be delayed back to New York.  But then I got there and then they decided delayed more.  And they said something about, you know, traffic in the Newark area.  I fucking hate that when you leave where you're staying and you're rushing to get your flight.  And then it's delayed three hours.  And I'm like, yeah, I could have just been in bed.  Yeah.  I don't go to the airport early in general ever.  And I didn't go early yesterday.  That's the sad part. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  Because, I mean, checking in at that airport, you could do the whole thing in ten minutes.  Yeah.  You could pull up, drop off your rental car, and get through security and be at your gate.  I'm not kidding.  In ten minutes.  Ten minutes.  How long would it take in the New York City area?  Oh, please be there five hours before your flight time.  What?  Five hours.  And they let me bring my mama-san spring rolls home.  Really?  That was very nice of them.  Did you have to take a bite out of one?  Well, they had all the sauces. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, shit.  And then one asshole has to tell me, the sauces are going to be a problem.  Are they?  That's what I said.  Are they?  It's my stupid, you know, I love them.  I love this place, Mama-san's in Rochester.  It's Vietnamese food.  And I brought some spring rolls home for the wife and myself.  But it has little, like, fucking peanut-type sauces.  Oh, man.  What if the pilot has a peanut allergy?  You throw it at him, see?  Right.  It's dangerous.  And I was going to say, can I at least taste the sauce in front of you so I can bring my 
[00:18:30]  stupid fucking late lunch home?  But I got it through.  They decided to be cool.  Look at you, like the fucking investigative reporter that brings the fucking bomb on board.  Look what you let through.  Sauces.  Sauces.  Sauces.  Sauces.  And, ooh, I almost sound like you know who they're.  Sauces.  Um, and then I got on a ghetto plane.  Really?  I haven't been on a ghetto plane in a while.  And a ghetto plane is one of those planes that is so obviously older than you. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, yeah.  This plane was so fucking old.  How old was it, baby?  They still had a strings.  Still had the shit stain from where Orville Wright was.  Right.  I don't know.  It was one of those tiny fucking planes where the lady has to, like, figure everybody out.  Like, okay, you have to sit over here now.  Oh, yeah.  Little weight distribution.  And you know who they're looking at.  The fatties.  They're looking at the fatties.  They got to redistribute the fatties. 
[00:19:30]  And they know that.  It's like.  But they don't say it that way.  And they start politely by going.  It was like.  The plane was, like, half empty.  So they're like.  You know.  Empty seats and rows over here.  Like, they knew they had to fill people in.  Yeah.  And no one was moving.  And then they started kind of hinting, like.  Hey, tubby.  Hey, tubby.  You know.  You're going to fuck us up.  You've got to move over.  And up to the left.  What do you think?  Ah, Jesus.  They must want to have an even number of fatties on a plane.  Yes.  So they can.  You've got an odd number of fatties. 
[00:20:00]  Now you've got to start figuring out how many regular people.  Right.  Equal the fatty.  Right.  Put them.  Now you've got to move multiple people per fatty.  But they're trained for that.  Right.  They just look at everybody and they just know.  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  Somehow we've got to get that tub of shit up here in the front.  Without insulting her feelings.  The fucking pilot looks and just goes.  And out loud.  Could you move that fat piece of shit up further?  Right.  But that's what they're thinking. 
[00:20:30]  Of course.  But they obviously can't say it that way.  So they redistributed everybody.  What kind of plane is it where the fucking wings are way the fuck above everything?  Oh, yeah.  Propellers.  Oh, yeah.  We had propellers.  Yeah, yeah.  Is it an umbraer?  I guess.  Is it the umbraer?  It's two seats on each side.  Old as fuck.  This plane was old as fuck and there were thunderstorms in the area.  So I'm like, great.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, so you had to fly through the...  Around the thunderstorms?  And I was sitting next to a chub.  Oh, you were?  A young chub.  A young chub?  Yeah.  Guy or girl?  Girl.  Oh, really?  Where it was one of those planes where you have the armrest that goes down.  Uh-huh.  And if she wasn't there and I should have moved, but I was tucked away in my seat and I was  really fucking tired.  I would have had the two seats.  That would have been nice.  But she was such a chub that we couldn't put down the thing.  So I'm just rubbing like... 
[00:21:30]  She was that fat?  I'm rubbing thighs with a chub all the way back to New York.  She was nice, though.  It was her first flight.  Oh.  Did you comfort her?  Well...  You had to rub that big pork fucking...  That big pork.  That ham hock.  We hit some bad turbulence and she was freaking out.  A bunch of people were freaking out.  Did she look like a big bowl of jelly?  Jiggling and wiggling.  Oh, everything was...  Was she jiggling?  I noticed the jig. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, that's another story.  I know.  Oh, Jesus.  I noticed the jiggle, I should say.  And then the stewardess who was just banged up.  White trash with fucking ridiculously crooked teeth.  Oh, she couldn't possibly be on one of the main-name airlines.  No, why is that?  One of the big planes.  It's like the day strippers and the night strippers.  Right.  Is it the strip club or the local dive?  Right.  You know, you gotta put them in where they're appropriate.  Yeah.  So the shitty little plane gets the crooked-toothed fucking hag. 
[00:22:30]  You know you're on a bad fucking plane.  Yeah.  God, we're doing bits right now.  And then you get Virgin...  I don't mean to.  Yeah.  You get Virgin Atlantic or something like that or even Virgin American.  Right.  You know, their stewardesses are pretty fucking on the money.  They're aerodynamic, if you know what I mean.  Yeah, exactly.  They're just like...  A little like this.  They're schmoo.  Yeah.  This chick was banged up.  Yeah.  And we hit some turbulence.  Pretty bad turbulence.  I haven't experienced that in a little while.  Those little planes will do that, too. 
[00:23:00]  Right.  It'll be easy.  The thing dropped and...  Oh, it was...  Oh, yeah.  I heard that the whole fucking time.  And, you know, the chub I was sitting next to was her first flight.  She freaked out a little.  But she was kind of cool.  And then other people kind of gave that gasp.  And the banged up stewardess who's sitting at the front of the classroom.  That's how small his plane was.  You could just see her sitting there and staring at all of us.  Was she in her little seat?  Yeah.  She fucking rolls her eyes.  Like, people obviously, you know, kind of gasp. 
[00:23:30]  Like, oh, what the fuck?  You know, no one's screaming or anything.  But they were a little fucking nervous.  She's like...  And she decides she needs to roll her eyes.  Because, you know, she's been in this type of turbulence a million times.  She probably walked away from flaming crashes.  Yeah, exactly.  Walking out of the fucking rubble like the Terminator.  Right.  All banged up.  I always look at them, though.  Because, you know, I know they've had way more experience flying than I do, certainly.  So, if they're looking at it like, ah, fuck.  Or are they still reading their stupid Us magazine? 
[00:24:00]  You know, then I know we're totally cool.  That's just regular shit.  Well, the veterans can usually do that.  But if you watched any of the airport movies, Opie, you will know that the veteran stewardess  will tell the young, fresh-faced stewardess back in the galley area during a problem, like,  just put a smile on and don't let anybody know.  And then she goes out shaking.  Can I got you some coffee?  Stewardess, I've noticed we've turned the plane around.  What?  No, it's just... 
[00:24:30]  It's that...  I love that cliche in every fucking plane crash movie.  That's hilarious.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I just had this...  She was ghetto, man.  Yeah.  I could tell she could get some things done, if you know what I mean.  Yeah.  She was ghetto.  Nice.  So, and then I was telling you just before we went on the air, I was right...  My window was facing the fucking landing gear, that big, giant landing gear coming out of  the wing.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[00:25:00]  Because you could see it because the wing is up high, so...  Yeah, coming out of the wing, you know, on each side, obviously.  Well, that'd be stupid if it's only on one side.  And I just decided, like, as the landing gear's coming down, I see that tiny little wheel,  like you were just saying, it's like a wheelbarrow.  Yeah, it really is.  A tiny wheel.  I decided, you know what?  You've seen the planes land a million fucking times.  Just fucking stare at that wheel.  Yeah.  Just fucking put your eyes in that goddamn wheel and just watch the process. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  And man, when that wheel hits the runway, it's a violent fucking scene.  Yeah?  Did you see some smoke?  You could see how that thing would just fucking twist off.  Yeah.  Just boom!  Boom!  Yeah, well, it's going from zero to, like, a hundred and fucking...  Right.  ...thirty, or whatever it is.  That's what I was watching, too, because the wheel, you know, perfectly still.  I'm like, okay, it's going to hit and start spinning like a motherfucker.  Yeah.  How'd they figure that shit out?  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's pretty impressive.  Yeah.  So, but I don't know. 
[00:26:00]  I feel bad for the people flying.  It's a nightmare.  I had three hours in the Rochester airport, and I left Monday after the show,  and I had at least, at least two to, yeah, almost three hours in the airport before I  even left.  Yeah.  Half my day, I was gone a day.  Half that time was spending it in the airport.  Three hours on each side, not counting the fly.  The fly.  People do that all the time.  It's amazing.  Like, Jimmy flies a lot.  He has been lately, especially.  Right.  I don't know how the fuck...  Because we know Jimmy.  Yeah.  How the fuck he doesn't just lose his shit, just start throwing things. 
[00:26:30]  I don't know.  But, you know, we don't have to get into it, but fucking going on fucking...  Ugh.  Oh.  This one was avoidable, too.  That's what sucks.  Was there a lot of, like, you kind of open your eyes wide, look at...  Kind of go, ha, what are you going to do?  Ah, yeah.  Ah, look at us.  Ah, ah.  We were all just kind of doing a little joking here and there.  A lot of look at each other, shake the head, and go, do that.  Ah, with the face. 
[00:27:00]  Ah.  And, you know, the priest and everyone makes it sound like it's an amazing thing to die  and be accepted by fucking God and Jesus and heaven.  The right hand of Jesus?  But I think the reason why everyone cries their eyes out at the hole at the cemetery  is because deep down they don't believe.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh, God.  That's my thought for the day.  Is that it?  That deep down...  Well, because it...  I mean, you know, I was brought up Catholic. 
[00:27:30]  I'm all over the place.  I don't believe, like, you know...  Like, I don't believe in what they're telling me in the Bible,  but I'm all over the place.  I don't know what to believe anymore.  Right.  And some asshole on Twitter is like,  just admit that you're an atheist and nothing fucking happens when you die.  Oh.  I would admit that if that's what I truly believe.  I don't know.  I'm just kind of, like, all over the fucking place.  I'm just serious.  But, I mean, they make it sound like it's a great fucking thing to die.  Like, it sucks for the people that you leave behind, but it's an amazing adventure. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, yeah.  And I came to the conclusion, as everyone's bawling, as our friend is being, you know, laid to rest,  but they're bawling, because deep down, they kind of doubt all those fairy tales.  Yee, so they just kind of...  Why wouldn't it be just an amazing, glorious fucking moment?  It would be.  It would be.  I don't know.  But, like you said, who the hell knows?  So you sit there and go, ah. 
[00:28:30]  I'm in the, uh, who the hell knows for real, for sure.  Who the hell knows?  But.  Well, regardless of what the fuck, that fucking, that husk, that husk that you call your body  is pretty much done at that point.  Whatever happens after that, with this essence of you, and all that, ah, you know, who knows?  But, oh boy, you'll never see that guy again.  That's pretty much the bottom line. 
[00:29:00]  And then you got the, then you got the hack jokes that, like, it's an open casket, and  then I had to hear from a few guys, like, you know, if anyone was going to sit up in  that moment, it would be him.  He would be the one.  And I'm like, oh, God.  Yeah, that ain't happening.  I'm like, please, please don't do this to yourself.  You know, out of anyone, he'd be the one that would sit up and go, hey, surprise. 
[00:29:30]  Would he?  He'd be the one, right?  Because he was, what, the jokester in life?  Look out.  The fun-loving guy.  He'd be the one that would set up this whole fucking thing to just sit up.  Would he?  I was so fucking embarrassed when, and this guy had to say it nice and loud because he  really thought he had a good one.  And you were just kind of like, oh, the big, the big douche chill. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, it was.  Yeah, it was my official.  Yeah, it was kind of the big chill, man.  Yeah.  Going back to, like, my.  Oh, yeah.  Going back to sort of where I went to college.  I mean, college was, what, 30, 40 miles south of there, and everyone coming back for a funeral.  Yeah.  That's completely.  But you're right.  It was the big douche chill.  The big douche chill.  He'd be the guy.  He would be the guy.  Am I right?  Am I right?  Yeah.  Was there any post-festivities? 
[00:30:30]  Um, yeah.  I mean, was it a little awkward to maybe share a beverage and be like, hey?  Hey, you know, seeing how he kind of went that route.  He was a drinker, if people need to know.  But he was way more than just that.  So, but, you know, the last few years of his life were more drinking than anything else,  unfortunately.  Was there any, like, toast? 
[00:31:00]  Like, hey, let's drink one for.  Well, yeah, you know, there's a little.  Because, you know, his name in college was Dr. Fon.  That's what I'm going to do.  Wait a minute.  Dr. Fon?  So you have to have one for Dr. Fon.  Dr. Fon?  Yeah.  That's a goddamn, that's a pretty impressive nickname, though.  That's not a bad name.  If you're going to be called Dr. Fon, you are the front guy.  You are the guy that's going to sit up in that coffin.  It's better than the Opster.  I'd rather have been named Dr. Fon than the Opster. 
[00:31:30]  Dr. Fon is pretty good.  Dr. Fon.  Yeah.  That drinking will get to, will get you, man.  Maybe not all of us, but some people, man, fuck.  No moderation?  No, his moderation went out the window a long time ago.  Damn.  He was a solid dude, though.  I don't want to focus on the fact how he went, because he really was a good dude.  Yeah.  With two sons he leaves behind, a 20-year-old and a 17-year-old.  Eek. 
[00:32:00]  The one kid looks just like him.  It's creepy.  It's pretty bad when that's, like, preventable, if you just would have maybe, you know, been  like, ah.  Yeah, there were a few signs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He had body parts shut down and then start working again, and he decided that was a sign  that he could, you know, maybe have a few.  Oh, that's, that's bad.  Yeah.  I mean, his friends tried.  They did everything they could.  Yeah.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Man. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, I guess, supposedly, he was supposed to tap out a year ago.  I didn't know any of this, because I've lost touch.  He had, his kidneys and his liver were done.  And they were basically saying, look, this guy's not going to make it.  And then, miraculously, well, a doctor suggested dialysis, and that got his kidneys working  again, and he decided, all right.  So it gets a little better, and you decide to just, you know, maybe take up where you  left off.  Wow.  I guess.  That's Dr. Fun.  Dr. Fun. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  I guess I say this to maybe help some people out there.  Man, sometimes there are signs.  Thank you.  That's the only fucking little speech I'll give you today.  In the end, he was a solid, solid dude.  That's why I went back, because it's a guy I haven't seen in many years, but he was just  one of those guys that, you know, he would light up a room.  He'd come in and just make 10 new friends wherever the fuck he went.  Yeah.  He was a great salesman, but unfortunately, the dark side of whatever, it was a lot stronger 
[00:33:30]  in the end.  Yee.  Yeah.  That happened with Anakin Skywalker, too.  That's true.  That's right.  The dark side.  The dark side really got a hold of it.  Did you ever hear that story?  Let me tell you, it was a long time ago, apparently in this galaxy, very far, far away.  Wow.  But, man, I got to see Brother Wheeze.  That was kind of cool.  How's he doing?  He's doing good, man.  Yeah?  Yeah, he's partying pretty good.  Good for him.  We went out on Monday night and had a few pops at a place called Tony D's. 
[00:34:00]  Nice little joint in Rochester.  Tony D's.  You're going to meet Tony D. I think he's coming to New York.  Oh, yeah?  He's going to stop in and say hi.  Yeah, you'll like Tony D.  All right.  Yeah.  But Wheeze is killing it up there in Rochester.  He's doing great.  And then everyone was trying to...  They were buying shots at the bar Monday night.  Shots?  Shots.  And Wheeze...  I mean, Wheeze is a lot older than me.  A lot older.  Yeah.  And he still can't figure out how to fake a shot. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, really?  He was putting them down?  Yeah, he was putting them down.  He had to get up to do radio the next day.  Oh, that sucks.  And on the way home, he's bumming out.  He's like, it was bad enough drinking a little more wine than usual or whatever.  And he goes, but those shots.  I'm like, I know, man.  I go, idiot.  I didn't do one of those shots.  No.  And he's all surprised.  Like, really?  I'm like, yeah.  Some guy I don't even know is buying shots for this whole crew here.  And sorry, you know, I'm not... 
[00:35:00]  The peer pressure's ridiculous.  Well, come on.  What are you, pussy?  What are you, faggot?  It's like, can you relax?  I'm happy.  I'm happy enough just drinking my stupid blue moon.  Don't worry about it.  I have a nice little buzz, and I'm going to have a few more beers.  And, you know, maybe if I decide I'll have a shot.  But you're not going to fucking strong arm me to have your stupid shot.  Yeah.  I'm too old for that.  That peer pressure left probably when I was 25.  Yeah. 
[00:35:30]  And, you know, and if you're going to insist, you know, that I do the shot,  well, as soon as you fucking put your goddamn mouth to the, you know, to the shot glass,  mine's going somewhere.  And conveniently, it was a nice garbage pail right there.  It's very hard to look at somebody doing a shot when you're doing a shot.  Right.  Your head goes up.  Right.  That's the time you use.  You got to time it out perfect.  It's like a magician.  And then you're like, oh, ooh, ooh, ah, ooh.  You time it out perfect, right?  And then you give that whoa face. 
[00:36:00]  And then maybe a little slam of the shot glass back on the bar.  And, you know, no one fucking knows.  And you don't have to deal with the, oh, you fucking, why?  You're fucking too good for us now that you're on the fucking radio?  Oh, God.  Shut up.  Oh, yeah.  But those were complete strangers, you know.  Right.  If it was guys I knew, then I probably would have done it just because, you know, for Dr.  Fun and all.  Well, you have to.  It was good, though. 
[00:36:30]  It was good to see some old faces.  Yeah.  Really good to see some old faces.  How do they look?  Good.  The live guys, yeah.  Yeah, they look all right, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  The women, not so much.  Oh.  I don't know what that is.  Well, we've all.  I've seen a lot of women in their upper 40s that do very, very well for themselves.  But you know what it is?  The chicks, they really got to, they got to work at it to look really good as they get 
[00:37:00]  older.  It's just a fact of life.  Guys, they can fall apart a little and girls will still fucking, you know.  Right.  Whatever.  It's an odd circumstance, but that's the way it is.  But man, if a woman gets up there, for the most part, not every woman, I know some just  have great genetics or something, but, and she doesn't work at it, eating right, and some  exercise and shit like that, man, can they get fat.  Right.  Holy fuckaroni.  A bunch of them looked all right.  Yeah.  But there were a few that were a little rough looking. 
[00:37:30]  A little, yeah.  A little rough looking.  Hit the old wall.  I'm not judging.  I'm not judging.  I'm not judging.  Who am I to judge?  Who am I to fucking judge?  Yeah, I hear you.  Dr. Fund wouldn't want me judging.  No.  No.  It was an open?  Yep.  Oh, that was terrible.  Did you look?  Yeah, I always look.  I never look.  I don't know why, but I always look.  I look and touch. 
[00:38:00]  No, you don't touch.  I touch.  Why?  I touch.  No, you don't.  Yeah, I do.  Why?  I don't know.  That's crazy.  I think it's out of pure curiosity.  I don't think it's like, oh, I got to have one last, you know, it's just.  What do you touch?  Mostly the hand and the arm usually.  No, why?  It feels like a mannequin, more or less, with tough skin.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I do a little touch. 
[00:38:30]  Don't touch.  A little touch.  Why touch?  I don't know.  I do, though.  I'm stunned.  Why?  I don't even look.  I go up there and I look down.  You can't look?  I never look into their face.  No, because I don't want to remember that.  Why the fuck do I need that memory?  And they might be the guy that opens his eyes.  Dr. Fun did it.  But he looked around the room, looking at Aaron like, I got to go.  Here it comes.  Out of anyone.  We all know that he would be the, I'm like, really? 
[00:39:00]  He would be the guy, right?  You should have walked him up, holding him by the scruff of his neck and go, really?  Look, look, look at him!  And just get all fucking uncomfortable.  Why are you laughing over there, Mars?  It's funny.  Oh, thank you, Mars.  Oh, funny.  Wow, geez.  Boy, we're off to a good start.  Mars thinks so.  This must be ethnic humor.  Oh, right.  Mars, it always comes down to race, doesn't it?  Anyway.  Wow, I can't believe you're a toucher.  I'm a little touch. 
[00:39:30]  I touch.  I didn't touch yesterday, really.  Really?  I touched a little.  I touched a sleeve.  That's touch.  What?  Did anyone?  I didn't touch skin yesterday.  No?  No.  Did anybody else touch?  Did you watch somebody else touch?  No, because their backs are to everyone, so you don't know what they're really doing up there.  Well.  I'm not staring at every person.  I would assume some other people are touching, but I'm not seeing it for myself. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, but I don't think anyone's touching.  That's weird.  I don't know.  I find that it's weird.  No touch.  Sam, you don't touch?  Sam.  Never.  It's so weird.  Steve C. I touched.  Oh, my God.  I touched him a lot.  Why?  I don't get it.  I understand, but.  Because I was mad, and I touched his arm in a few places, because he had just like a  t-shirt on.  With his tats showing?  All that, man.  Oh, my God. 
[00:40:30]  He looked like a guy that could have easily sat up.  Off to eternity?  He'd have been the guy.  Off to eternity with a t-shirt?  Yeah.  Wow.  A foundry shirt, I believe.  Yes.  Hello, God.  Yeah, touch.  A little touch.  The touching is so weird, though.  It is.  I don't want to know about it.  I think, but see, I think it's creepier.  Like, you say you don't look and you don't touch.  I think that's creepier. 
[00:41:00]  Like, if you look at it, you can almost put your head around the whole thing a little  better.  A little better.  Believe me.  I can put my head around it.  A little better.  I just don't like, I like being like, well, let me think about Dr. Fun, if that was the  case.  Right.  I'd be like, oh, yeah, that Dr. Fun.  I remember that with Dr. Fun.  I remember that.  Ah, he's dead!  His face is dead!  Yeah, I know.  I like eliminating that part from my memory by never putting it in in the first place.  Gotcha.  Yep.  You can't unsee that. 
[00:41:30]  I remember seeing like a relative once, and this is when I stopped looking.  It was probably, I was probably maybe in my mid-early teens around there.  Right.  And the person in the box was literally purple.  They were purple!  Purple!  Purple?  Yes.  And now, to this day.  You see purple.  I remember that person, and I have other memories and stuff, but it always just creeps 
[00:42:00]  in.  Purple face.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, that was fun.  Yeah, I remember.  God, we went, we went there, and then, hey, it's purple face.  How you doing?  Nah!  I don't want to remember the purple face!  Why purple face?  I don't know!  Because they're dead!  Because they're dead, Jerry.  And, and, and, and I, I, I, but purple, they could, they usually figure that shit  out.  Hey, whatever.  Who is the person?  Well, I don't want to say, because I don't want to, like, I don't want to, if anybody's 
[00:42:30]  listening that was close to the person, I don't want to be like your, your fucking  family member, I don't think I can tell, I don't think I can tell, I don't think I can  tell college stories anymore.  Why?  I realize they all listen.  Oh, do they?  Oh, God, they all listen.  I thought I was, I thought I was sneaking some good stories through without hurting anyone's  feelings.  Oh, they all listen.  No.  Oh, they all listen.  Well, you haven't bad-mouthed anybody.  I don't bad-mouth anyone, I just.  Yeah, they probably like hearing the stories. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, I think so in general.  The big mac and cheese party?  Did, uh, did that come up?  No mac and cheese people were there, no.  No, if anybody was going to throw a mac and cheese party, it's the upster.  All right, come on.  No, then there was an, there was another story, like, uh, somebody got a phone call from our  pal who's now, you know, God, um, got a phone call when he was supposed to be dead.  What? 
[00:43:30]  So then that was another, like, joke, like, leave it to him, he's going to be calling us  all the time.  No.  Leave it to him, he's going to bother us for the rest of our lives.  But it turned out to be one of those weird things where someone else called from his,  his phone.  Oh.  So it looked like he was calling people after he died, and that's, you know.  Leave it to him, he would be the one. 
[00:44:00]  I saw my, I saw my dad die.  Oh, man.  No, I'm, the only reason I'm bringing it up today, I bring it up a lot lately.  Um, is because what you just said, and to, to see someone die is beyond horrific, because  you see what the body could do instantly after.  Oh, I don't want to know.  The colors changed drastically.  Yeah.  Without getting too morbid.  But I don't remember that as much anymore.  Oh, that's a good thing, probably.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I remember it at this moment, because you brought up your thing, but in general, I don't remember 
[00:44:30]  that anymore.  Yeah.  That was downright horrific.  I just remember cool shit about my dad now.  Yeah.  Not that, not the last moment.  Jeez.  Yeah.  Wow.  The funeral I went to, the mother grabbed the son, and the arm fell off.  Stop it.  Come on.  Why would that happen?  There's no way.  Why would that happen?  Jason, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  I wish I could say it was a joke, but it really, really wasn't a joke. 
[00:45:00]  First off, Oprah, you know, funerals are a tough thing.  I have an uncle that's an obama, and I've been through a lot of like him this week.  He's come to shortcut, and so, you know, you and me and your cousin, take this shortcut,  and he'd walk in, and there'd be two people getting, you know, the flu with the internet.  But, oh, it's just a crazy thing.  But, so at the funeral, there was a construction accident.  The mom, you know, old Italian lady, she's screaming and yelling.  She grabs the kid, and, like, she's like, why, why? 
[00:45:30]  And then, whoop, the left arm, yeah, the left arm just falls right into the casket.  Oh, Jesus.  Hold on, hold on.  It's funny, but I gotta laugh.  And then you go, and you're looking in the casket.  He's upright, because the mom is grabbing him, and he's just living in the bottom of the casket,  like just the casket, like just the limb died.  You'll go and visit the dead limb.  That's funny.  Fuck you.  Jason has that Brooklyn attitude. 
[00:46:00]  I love it.  Oh, yeah.  Unbelievable, man.  Unbelievable.  I wish I was able to, like, take both of them, because he had good working hands.  He had plenty of good working hands.  Right.  I have a great day, boys.  Enjoy the day.  Thank you, sir.  All right, we will, man.  Someone's asking, what about a goodbye kiss?  Oh, no.  No kissing.  No.  We got a bunch of touchers.  That's crazy.  People have to go with the quick touch.  Nothing too crazy.  It's anything, any contact with that thing that is no longer a person is unnecessary, a bit morbid, if you ask me. 
[00:46:30]  Again, I'm pulling an opiate.  I'm not judging.  But I'm just saying.  That soul thing is a powerful thing, though, man.  You realize that soul thing leaves bodies.  I don't know where the fuck it goes, but.  Oh, you're just a banana peel.  That it factor, when you see a dead body, you realize that soul thing is long gone.  Yeah.  Long fucking gone. 
[00:47:00]  Because you could see people sleeping.  Yeah.  And you know that you see the soul.  Uh-huh.  And I'm not talking about, like, where, and don't say, well, that's because you know they're sleeping, you see them moving.  No, I'm talking about you're not noticing the person's sleep, you know, is moving.  You see them, and you realize that fucking person has a soul.  Yeah.  Same thing now, you know, someone dead in a fucking coffin could be just sleeping, but you just know it's not sleeping, because that fucking, that it factor that makes us all who we are is long gone. 
[00:47:30]  The divine spark.  Whatever.  Yeah.  Some people, you know, that's how people describe it, certainly.  Do you know what I'm trying to say?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You look, it's that fucking, you know, that little element that no one could quite put their finger on.  Right, and you can't really define.  Yeah.  But you, when you know it's gone, though.  Oh, yeah.  From these people that have passed, so.  Whatever.  There's a lot of funeral stories now, but.  Yeah, why go there? 
[00:48:00]  It's a happy occasion.  What?  I don't know.  It was cool.  It was cool to see a lot of, you know, people and stuff.  Yeah.  Everyone, like, doing well?  Did they all wind up doing well for themselves?  Yeah, a lot of them are doing all right for themselves.  Yeah.  That's pretty good.  Yeah, a lot of them are doing okay, man.  You didn't have a fucking poverty guy that just walks around going, it must be nice, huh?  Yeah, you know, you could.  Yeah.  Get a couple of those guys.  Yeah, but, you know, I don't have to tell you, you know, must be nice. 
[00:48:30]  It's a shot.  Oh, Mr. Moneybags.  Here it is.  Oh, jeez.  So how many cars did you buy?  I'm still driving, my fucker.  Remember the car I used to drive?  What?  You're still driving?  Oh, for the old time's sake, you want to spin a couple tunes over there?  Show them how it's done.  I've gotten that one.  Every wedding.  Probably a thousand times.  The one guy that has to think he's being clever.  Hey, why don't you get up there and spin some tunes? 
[00:49:00]  Show them how it's done, huh?  You want a DJ?  Radio boy?  But they're all the same people.  We all know those people.  Oh, yeah.  People are relating.  They all know.  They all know that guy.  Oh, God.  That was it, I guess.  It was a quick trip.  Yeah.  Fucking quick trip to Rochester and back.  We should make a little more money and then move to Rochester. 
[00:49:30]  We'd be fucking kings up there.  Really?  Not doing radio.  I mean, just live like kings.  Unfortunately, it's still in the state of New York, which I will refuse to live in once  I finally retire, find a place to go to.  It will not be the state of New York.  They could go fuck themselves.  Pennsylvania?  PA?  Could be PA.  Could be PA.  Could be somewhere maybe a little further south.  You know, you got to take into consideration what you call the weather, maybe. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  Laws.  And I mean everything.  You know, I'd like to move to a nice fucking, maybe tax-free state.  You know, no state tax, things like that.  But, um, yeah.  New York, though, fuck that.  Yeah, I'm not a fan.  I'm not a fan at all.  Too much shit going on in this state.  Man.  And Cuomo's just making it worse.  Not a fan of New York City.  No.  People like, and people like, oh, God, it must be great to live in New York City. 
[00:50:30]  I'm like, yeah, that's, you know.  The city itself.  Good for the job.  I don't have to commute.  Yeah, yeah.  But I would much rather live somewhere else.  Mm-hmm.  Have a big, huge spread somewhere.  Oh, man.  That'd be nice.  What you could get.  I know.  Oh.  These fucking, uh, this fucking tornado, man.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, you gotta stay out of that tornado alley, as they say.  I don't know how you deal with that.  I guess it doesn't happen a lot, is how they deal with it. 
[00:51:00]  It's, uh, the old Russian roulette thing.  There are plenty of tornadoes, but a lot of times they just roll around places that are not populated at all.  Or you just skate.  Like, they picked the town next to you this time.  Yeah.  But man, rolling the dice like that.  Holy fuck.  Yay!  And this one, they said, I didn't know them.  A lot of times you got 12 to 13 minutes warning.  Yeah.  They just know, okay.  These days.  Damn, this is where it's at. 
[00:51:30]  You got 12 to 13 minutes.  But supposedly this one, they said, they were able to warn people, uh, they, they, they had 16 minutes.  Which I guess is a major fucking big deal, that extra two or three minutes.  That was due to, uh, a little, uh, device called Dorothy, by the way.  Where they were able to, to get censors up into the funnel.  Oh, how many fucking of those references.  I want to thank all the finger of God tweets that got the last few days.  No, really, you were the only one that tweeted that.  Yeah.  You really were.  You were the only one.  I finally just tweeted a link to the clip. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, did you?  From Twister.  Yeah, I found it on YouTube.  I'm like, here, fucking watch it and have fun.  I want to thank the one guy that was clever enough to come up with that.  You're a special individual.  The Fujita scale.  Yeah.  That, uh.  That was a scary one.  That fucking video they keep showing.  They wound up getting.  Holy shit.  You know, finally, after all this time, wound up getting an amazing video.  From start to finish of a fucking tornado. 
[00:52:30]  Right.  Um.  A huge tornado.  Giant.  Was it a Cat 4 officially?  I think they went for an F5.  I saw on the news.  They said that.  Is Cat the wrong term on that?  Yeah, yeah.  Cats for hurricanes.  Oh, you're right.  Yes.  So the F5.  F.  The Fujita scale.  Right.  Yes.  Uh.  You know, remember.  An F, uh.  An F, uh.  Four.  Well, you know.  To relocate your house.  Mm-hmm.  Uh. 
[00:53:00]  And then, uh.  She asked.  What about it?  Is there.  Is there an F5?  An F5.  What would.  What would that be like?  Right.  And they all.  Oh.  What.  Oh.  What would that be like?  Is there an F5?  Is there an F5?  Finger of God.  And they all looked around like no one's ever asked it before.  Like, they would be.  The reality, she'd be like, is there an F5? 
[00:53:30]  And they'd be like, yeah.  It's pretty fucking bad.  Wouldn't all those dummies know an F5?  They wouldn't look around like, oh, we don't even.  We can't even talk about it.  Right.  Holy shit.  Dude, what the fuck?  Look at this thing.  Look at the whole.  Look how fast the outer clouds are spinning.  They said 200 miles an hour, right?  That thing was spinning?  I think they recorded gusts of 300.  What?  Yeah.  I'm a little behind on this.  I heard over 200.  Sustained wind.  Okay.  And gusts over 300. 
[00:54:00]  And gusts over 300.  Wow.  There was just rubble left.  There were little piles of rubble that were at the end of these little driveways where  the road, you see the road, the driveways, and then just piles of completely pulverized  dwellings.  Jesus.  Amazing.  And like I said, luck of the draw.  These things, tornadoes happen, but the heartland out there is so vast and the population centers  are so far apart that for the most part, they just, no one ever sees them. 
[00:54:30]  They go across the plains.  Right.  You know, they could be the most devastating tornado if they were hitting a town.  Right.  But they didn't.  This one.  Hit a town.  Hit a fucking town.  And when you think a mile wide.  I heard two miles wide.  Two miles wide in some places?  I heard two miles wide.  Yeah.  Jesus.  That's literally a monster.  Right.  It's a wind monster.  It's a creature that has descended from the heavens to wreak havoc.  Was it officially an F5? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  And F5s are really, without getting into that movie shit.  Yeah, yeah.  That's just the...  They're really rare, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Especially to hit a town.  Wow.  Like that.  And then the death toll was horrible.  Dude.  And then they were able to lower it?  The fucking news.  And the news is like early reports.  No, you were the...  You fucking misreported.  You fucking reported that 91 people were dead.  Right.  Two dozen children, they reported, were dead. 
[00:55:30]  And they could not fucking say tiny bodies more.  They love saying tiny bodies.  When I heard tiny bodies...  Right.  And they're pulling the tiny bodies out of tiny bodies.  There were tiny bodies...  I'm like, this is not...  What are you...  You're trying too hard.  Report the story.  Obviously.  It's terrible.  I think they jack off in between their reports.  They're so into it.  Well, they couldn't say...  You see the one lady yesterday with the bowling ball? 
[00:56:00]  Huh?  She was holding a bowling ball because there was a bowling alley that was destroyed.  Really?  And a bowling ball with like a princess on it or something.  She found her bowling ball?  People have their priorities.  And she had to dramatically show you that this is a bowling ball and this used to be a bowling alley.  And this is about the spot you would have come in to get your bowling shoes.  And over there, you can see, is where the kiosks used to be.  Yeah, lady.  Who gives a shit?  I understand what a bowling alley is. 
[00:56:30]  But they had to find the bowling alley because I guess that was more dramatic than anything else for some reason.  Dude, could you imagine bowling balls just flying through the air at 200 miles an hour?  You see the teacher that was impaled?  Insane.  By the desk leg or whatever?  Oh my God, no.  You didn't see that?  No.  That was late yesterday.  They got a picture of her.  It went right through her fucking lower leg.  Ow!  Could you find that?  That was everywhere.  Yeah. 
[00:57:00]  It was a teacher that I guess really, really, really is a hero and helped a lot of students.  But one of the legs from the desk, I guess, impaled her right through her fucking lower leg.  There it is.  Oh, they block it out.  Why are they blocking it out?  Why are they blocking it out?  It's the internet.  I don't know why they block a lot of things out.  That don't make sense.  Wow, that's like a metal leg of a...  I understand.  It's like satellite radio.  This was supposed to be this new thing where you can really do whatever the fuck you want. 
[00:57:30]  The mail would show it.  And no, it's...  No.  We can curse.  That's about it.  Who cares?  Everyone curses.  But the internet's doing the same shit.  They're starting to block out stuff that should just be on the internet.  That shit fucking flew right through her leg.  How unlucky.  Well, I mean, it could be more unlucky, obviously, and not have your life anymore.  But I'm just saying, how the fuck?  Like, the dynamics that take place during tornadoes are really amazing.  Like, what happens to objects that aren't normally solid, and then they become like fucking spears. 
[00:58:00]  Other things that, like, you wouldn't think could move that quickly.  Right.  It's just amazing.  Jesus.  They're blocking it out.  Why?  Yeah.  This is news.  That's actual news.  That's way more important than showing a stupid bowling ball.  Not to the bowling ball lady.  That was very important to her.  This guy's saying it was an EF5. 
[00:58:30]  What's the difference, Ant?  Do you know?  It's the fucking E-something for Jew.  Since 1950, there's only been 15 EF5s in the U.S.  But what is an EF5?  It's the Fujita scale, but the E, who is that?  Who's trying to fucking bomb on to the E?  Why are you adding the E on there, Jim?  Hey, not for sure why they put the E on there.  I said that up when I called in.  Not for sure what the acronym stands for, but the Weather Channel last night officially reported  as what was called an EF5, and it said since the 1950s, only 15 EF5s have hit the United 
[00:59:00]  States, and now two of them have hit more Oklahoma.  It's already here.  Yeah, the last one they had was in 99, did they say?  1999, that is correct.  And that was, I'll just say, an EF5 as well?  Huh?  It was correct.  It was an EF5 also.  Wow, EF5.  And the same fucking town.  The exact same town was wiped off the face of the earth then, and they rebuilt it.  Wow, amazing.  And this was a newer town.  You know, I've got a daughter that's at Fort Raleigh, Kansas, out there in the Army, and 
[00:59:30]  I mean, this kind of shit happens.  You've got the Weather Channel on, you're trying to make phone calls, you want to make sure  everybody's all right.  There are no warnings for these things whatsoever.  They can tell you 10 minutes, 15 minutes, it's not enough time.  Well, it is for a lot of people.  Those storms, those tornadoes used to take hundreds of lives before they were able to really give  kind of a...  Well, there was a time...  We've talked about this over the years.  There was a time...  Thank you, sir, for your phone call.  You're welcome.  You guys have a good day.  There was a time you'd just be a farmer or whatever, like, oh, well, what's... 
[01:00:00]  Hey, storm coming.  Well, look at those clouds roll.  Oh, a little dark over there.  Yeah, yeah.  You have no idea that that's a tornado about to wipe you out.  Now they...  Or a hurricane.  Yeah, hurricanes.  Hurricanes, they would have no fucking clue.  Just a slow-moving storm before the Weather Channel, before the Internet, before TV, before...  Oh, radar.  Weather radar, satellite images.  All that shit.  You just would be minding your own business.  Hey, we're here at the beach. 
[01:00:30]  And a hurricane would be barreling down on you slowly but surely, but it would take you  out because you never knew.  So many people.  It was coming.  Now they do a pretty good job, and now I think also with things like, you know, you've got  your phone, alerts pop up, beep, beep, beep, and you look and you go, oh, it's an alert.  Right.  And it, like, lets you know a lot more than...  You can't be in front of the TV all the time or in front of the radio, but you always have  your phone with you.  I think that definitely cuts down on the fatalities.  This is the one thing I don't know about tornadoes. 
[01:01:00]  So when this thing, like, officially touches down, do they have a pretty good idea of  the direction, or could it still be willy-nilly after it hits the ground?  On a pretty big scale, they have an idea of which direction it's moving in because the  storms itself are moving in a certain direction.  Right.  But localized, they can't tell if, you know, it's going to wipe out Main Street or fucking  Oak Street or something like that.  It still could move, certainly, but they know about, okay, this thing is going to do, is  going to move northwest in this swath. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, but it goes on a squirrely line, so it could...  No, I understand that part.  Yeah, yeah.  But in general, they know the direction.  Yeah, pretty much.  Look, man, if you're within a mile or two of this fucking swath that we are showing you,  you get the fuck out of there.  When it's done and you see that big fucking just trail of destruction, it is amazing.  And people are like, well, you know, one house on one side of the street's okay and the other  side is...  But it is.  You look and you see, like, all right, that's the devastation line. 
[01:02:00]  Right.  And then this house here, you know, I'm sure he's going to be raking up, but at least his  house is still there.  Did you see the aerial view where, I guess it's just a wide open field, so there was  nothing it could really destroy?  Yeah.  And it was just a brown line?  Yeah.  Did you see that?  It fucking just turned up the...  Just chews up the fucking ground?  But, I mean, the brown line didn't seem that wide at all at that point.  Yeah.  But it showed this weird, like, okay, and then it kind of made a circle over here, and then  it went over here to the left, and then it... 
[01:02:30]  You could see on the video...  Pretty amazing.  ...when it started, the little funnel cloud coming out of the clouds, and then it starts  moving down, a little pointy, very thin tornado, and it hits the ground, and then it just fucking  really quickly just spread out.  Yeah, there it is.  And it just spread out where the base was giant.  What is CNN listening to us?  They're showing the exact clip I was just talking about. 
[01:03:00]  The devastation, yeah, look at that.  But then the little fucking brown, little fucking squiggly line that you can see in  the open fields.  That thing is fucking, like, look at...  That thing is tight, too, that when it first started...  Right.  It's just...  Like, you knew that was going to be bad.  You know, we talk to a lot of people that have seen this.  Yeah.  I can't...  I mean, that's why I love that we're fortunate enough to talk to the whole country.  Like, where we live, I can't even imagine seeing this.  No. 
[01:03:30]  We get to see it on TV, that's about it.  Yeah.  And then New York, occasionally you get those Jersey...  You get those people go, it was definitely a tornado.  Right.  They're classifying it as a tornado.  But it's not a weather...  It's a weather-related tornado, but not like this.  It's like the direction of the winds kind of made one of those swirly fucking wind patterns.  Just say it.  When we get them, they're really sloppy.  Yeah, they're not real tornado... 
[01:04:00]  They're not made the same way these are made.  No, man.  It's more a wind issue than it is a hot and cold frontal issue coming together.  So we don't get those.  No.  Ever.  They're saying the tornado had more energy than a Hiroshima bomb.  Yeah, but it didn't fucking unload it all in a split second on one little area.  Third major tornado they had in 13 years, Joplin, Missouri.  Joplin, Missouri, right? 
[01:04:30]  Joplin.  They had it now five, two years ago.  Yeah, we remember that one.  Yeah, yeah.  But the media, the way they were spinning those death numbers, oh my God, they couldn't fucking  get the death count up enough or just keep telling you, oh, what's the death toll?  And it's expected to rise.  Like, they love when a death toll is expected to rise.  Of course they do.  We're now getting word there are 91 fatalities. 
[01:05:00]  They fucking wrote off 91 people in this thing, and then they had to pull back and say, ah.  They pulled way back, right?  I guess they found some people.  Good.  Two dozen children, their tiny bodies being pulled from the wreckage.  That's a news thing.  Let's interview this person and have them in shock, crying.  That's a news thing.  I mean, it's not bad enough that people die.  Then they have to find the youngest victim, because that really hurts.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They do that with every one of these things now.  The Boston Marathon bombing was horrific, but then they had to really focus on the fact 
[01:05:30]  that one of the victims was eight years old.  Yeah.  They love that.  Trust me, it was horrific enough.  We didn't need to know how old the youngest victim was to really fucking pull at the heartstrings.  But they love doing that shit.  They can't get enough.  And, of course, this guy has to say the other caller was full of shit, and we love this on the show.  So let's go here.  Sean on Long Island.  What's up, Sean?  Hey, how you doing, Nance?  Yeah, I just wanted to ask Anthony, if he thinks Obama's going to ban wind now that 21 children died in a school. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, I didn't hear that.  By the way, 21 children didn't die.  It's tragic and all, but I think it was what?  Nine?  It was not even eight.  Eight kids, nine kids, nine kids.  Oh, they're down to nine kids?  Yeah, seven.  Seven.  They're down to seven kids?  Seven kids.  They had 20, they said 20 fucking one at one point.  I heard two dozen, and then 21, and then, you know, you wake up the next morning and watch the news, and they brought the entire toll down. 
[01:06:30]  Well, I mean, they're not stupid.  You know, they get hearsay and people just talking in the area, and whatever number they get, they just go with, knowing it's great for TV.  Yeah.  And probably in their hearts of hearts, they're like, we can't fucking prove this, but man, does it sound good?  This will be good for us.  And again, no fucking, the people that lost people there, it's terrible. 
[01:07:00]  Of course.  But when you look at what happened, and you think of the actual casualty count there, it's fucking amazing.  It really is.  Those houses were pulverized.  And were a lot of the people just in their houses?  Because where do you go?  Basements, an interior room.  Some people have hurricane shelters, or tornado shelters, but not a lot in that area, you'd think.  You would think that would be a great business to get into.  But I hear it's expensive. 
[01:07:30]  But wouldn't you be the guy like, hey, not when I fucking build it.  Yeah, yeah.  You get a lot of business if you knock down your prices.  And it's not even like a bomb shelter where it's like, oh, yeah, well, let me buy one just in case, you know, the once in a lifetime ever, once in no one's lifetime event happens.  But tornadoes, when you live there, you got to bank on, you know, it's probably going to happen at some point.  Right.  Yeah, I just heard it's too expensive to, you know, to get that shit done.  Yeah, not for you, I bet, right? 
[01:08:00]  You'd be the one.  Yeah, yeah, you got one of them, I bet.  He'd be the one, you know.  Got that at your mansion, yeah?  He'd be the one that would survive this.  We all know it.  He'd be the one.  Be the one guy.  He'd be the one that would be flying through the air five miles, but you know, he'd land soft.  I probably wouldn't spill his beer either, you know, because he really knew how to flip it.  All right.  Steve in Moore, Oklahoma.  What's up, Steve? 
[01:08:30]  Hey, morning, guys.  How close were you to this shit?  Three blocks from my house.  It's totally flat.  Wow.  So you weren't that close.  Oh, my God.  No, no.  Sorry.  That's fucked up, dude, for real.  I mean, it's hard to make jokes.  This thing was a sky monster.  What are your impressions?  Can you tell us, sir?  Well, there was a nader.  No, see, that's...  Jesus.  Jesus is right.  I didn't even see that coming. 
[01:09:00]  No, come on, now.  We've got to laugh a little.  If you can't laugh a little, then, you know.  Oh, my goodness.  No, but it seriously did miss us by three blocks.  I am very, very lucky that my family's alive and, you know, so many people all the way around us.  Everything's gone.  Right.  You know, one thing, it's like any other...  Do you have a little guilt when you go home at night and turn on that nice flat-screen TV in your beautiful living room knowing three blocks away?  Devastation.  Yeah.  People have nothing? 
[01:09:30]  Believe it or not, we got power back last night, and that's just...  How the fuck do they have power?  How do they figure that shit out?  How the hell are you?  I mean, it's amazing, and it's just, you know, it's like any other grad seat.  It's way worse in person than it is on TV.  I've lived in this town my entire life.  I've lived through the 99 one, saw that.  This one, I think there's more damage and more devastation than this one. 
[01:10:00]  The property damage is astounding.  The loss of life, you know, it's amazing that anyone survived it.  It's, you know, there's a video.  Everybody has, the news agencies has video.  They love placing people in front of their destroyed house.  Yep.  We're watching, you know, hey, let's talk to this family.  Let's see how it's going.  Could you stand in front of your destroyed house, please?  Let's see how it's going.  We had no water, but it was okay, because there was a place to stay, and there was family, and it was okay.  And right now we're staying in a hotel that our insurance has taken care of, so we are getting blessing after blessing. 
[01:10:30]  There's a rainbow everywhere, and with God, all things are possible.  We are so sorry for your loss, but we are so thrilled for you that you are all okay,  and that you are surrounded by each other and by these blessings that you think of.  I know that she's signing for.  Josh James, thank you so much.  It looks like her husband.  Our husband's a thief.  Husband's a mite bit thief.  Looks like the kid is, too. 
[01:11:00]  A head-on starting point.  So what now for people like Belize and all the people who are left homeless here in this town?  We'll speak to FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate about the plan to help people get back.  You know what I mean?  So what news agencies are there?  Is Morning Joe there?  Oh, everyone's there.  Are all the morning shows going to be there?  Do they all whisk themselves down there quickly so they can set up their little desk in front of the fucking wreckage?  Yeah, they're all here, guys.  Oh, hi.  Talking to you.  I forgot to tell you. 
[01:11:30]  On the way to the airport on Monday, when all this shit was going down, there was a lady, I don't know, somewhere in, whatever.  She was in Manhattan, too.  And she was waving down a cab dramatically.  And we were at a red light.  So I go to my cabbie.  Yeah.  I could tell he was a little dirty.  I go, hey, man, we could pick her up.  And his eyes got really wide because in New York City, you can only pick up one fucking fan.  Unless you're together.  Unless you go, hey, we're picking up my friend as well or whatever.  Right.  His eyes lit up because it's an airport run. 
[01:12:00]  He already got me, which is pretty nice money.  And then he's thinking, holy fuck, I get two airport runs for the, you know.  One run.  One ride.  So we, I say, fuck it.  So I go, hey, I rolled down the window.  You need a cab.  And she's like, yes.  Can I go with you guys?  I'm like, yeah, I don't give a fuck.  And the cabbie was so excited.  And then he looks at me as she's getting in the car, like, I'm going to give you a break.  I'm going to give you.  You just made my day.  Oh, wow.  He was so excited because they're like, they're 80, 90 bucks, you know, to get to the airport. 
[01:12:30]  And now he's looking at two.  He's going to give me a little break, but he's still going to make well over 80 or 90 for the same ride.  The same amount of work.  Long story short, she's a reporter for somebody.  And she was in the car making all sorts of calls.  She had to get there.  And then she was, like, trying to fly into Kansas.  Then she was going to drive to Oklahoma City.  But then, you know, they weren't really sure where the real action was yet.  Yeah.  So then as we're going to Newark, like, her flight is changing. 
[01:13:00]  Now book me on this flight.  And now book me on the original, the whole ride.  It was fascinating.  Her name was Naya, N-A-I-A or something.  I wonder who she works for.  It looks like she's got maybe, you know, freelance or something.  Yeah.  She got the call to go down to the devastation and do some reporting.  Why do they all have to?  I think it's N-A-I-A or something like that.  Go down there.  Huh?  Why do they all have to go down there?  Because we all love looking at it in the end. 
[01:13:30]  But there's plenty of people there.  Yeah.  They always go with the locals, right?  Yeah.  And it's like, oh, we want to get the story.  We want to get right in there and get the story.  I have a tornado report from PA.  I was watching.  They're all basic calls coming in about the tornado.  That very dramatic video of the woman finding her little dog.  That seemed to be the big...  Oh, really?  The big...  I didn't see that yet. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, well, let's pop that up.  Look at this woman.  She starts yapping and yapping about the storm.  Right.  Oh, you didn't save that tab there, Ron?  Oh, wow.  Oh, the old lady?  I was holding my dog.  I was sitting on the stool holding my dog.  This was the game plan.  She's old, gray-haired.  You know, to go in that little bathroom.  Fat old lady.  Yes.  And she's just standing in front of a pile of rubble. 
[01:14:30]  This is your neighborhood.  I can't imagine.  She held her dog.  Pause.  Pause.  Pause.  This is what drives me nuts about reporters.  Look, you got an old lady.  Obviously, everything she used to own is now just rubble.  It's right there.  Look, it looks like it went through a wood chipper.  Right.  Exactly.  But the reporter has to fucking push it.  Yeah.  And you're about to hear the reporter pushing it.  The reporters absolutely try to get these people to cry. 
[01:15:00]  Absolutely.  And it's not like a byproduct of their legitimate questions and what they feel they need to do.  They are trying to get them to cry.  And that's the only reason they're saying certain things in the way they're saying.  And if they need to do that, fine.  But let's not make believe that the question was so important that you had to ask it.  If it was radio, I would understand a reporter asking questions like that because you don't see the pictures.  The picture alone, as they've said a million times, the picture tells the story. 
[01:15:30]  The picture tells the story.  So she ran into a bathroom.  Right.  This is the beginning of the video, and it goes on for a little while, so we'll just give you a little synopsis.  She went into the bathroom and hunkered down with her dog.  She held on to her dog.  And she's talking about how she saw the stool, I guess the commode, whatever, the turlet, rise up out of the floor.  Wow.  And then everything just piled down on top of her. 
[01:16:00]  She was able to crawl out and realize she was okay.  But she says it on this clip.  She's like, but, you know, I lost my dog.  I can't find my dog.  And there's absolutely nothing left of the house.  Right.  And then we continue from there.  Here's the reporter.  And she starts babbling.  Yeah, yes.  Exactly.  And, uh, what do you, I mean, what do you, what do you think of all this?  This is your neighborhood.  I can't imagine. 
[01:16:30]  You know, what do you, what do you, what do you think of all this?  Because the, the producer, that's the dog.  The dog, I thought the dog.  And then under a piece of sheet metal.  What?  The, the little dog is stuck.  It's trapped under wreckage.  And now the producer and the cameraman and the reporter isn't even helping her pull the  fucking dog out.  What assholes.  They're making this old lady fucking, oh, good, dude.  All right, then they finally, well, they had to get their shot dramatically. 
[01:17:00]  And then they're like, okay, now you can go help her.  Look at the little guy.  He's so scared.  Oh.  Oh.  Her oh face.  Oh.  Oh.  That's a cool moment.  They lucked out there, huh?  Yeah.  Unless it was all planted.  Yeah.  They found the dogs.  The dog said, let me be okay.  The answer both of them.  Oh.  Because she just did.  Because this was my life, my favorite prayer. 
[01:17:30]  Oh.  The little guy heard her talking and was crawling from the wreckage.  I'm so glad.  Are you glad?  Yeah.  She's so glad.  The cameraman didn't put the camera down.  That's for sure.  Did you get that?  And then the dog walks away.  He's all fine.  That was a cool moment.  The old lady and her little fucking doggy.  Look, Chester's okay.  He came out of the tornado. 
[01:18:00]  Chester was in a tornado.  And the whole room was spinning around and around and around.  But then I found out it wasn't a tornado.  I just had the bed spins.  Chester was fine.  Chester was caught in a tornado and apparently one of Opie's boots were caught in the tornado and it hit little Chester in the side.  Shut up. 
[01:18:30]  His boot was attached to a sock and his own foot.  But it flew around in the tornado.  We got a dramatic story coming in.  Let's go to Bobby.  Bobby, I hear you were in the tornado.  It was crazy.  It was like a train.  The roof was coming off.  I would have been dead if I didn't grab onto E-Rock.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, E-Rock. 
[01:19:00]  E-Rock, you'd be happy to know that a couple of the old boys of mine, my old friends, are really digging the E-Rock songs.  Oh, wow.  I didn't ask them.  They came up to me and said, by the way, we're digging the E-Rock songs.  Who wouldn't?  Why would that make you?  Buzzy would be one of those guys, my old roommate.  Why would that make E-Rock happy?  You said he'd be happy to...  The guys are going through some tough times with a friend dying and to get a little joy and laughter from E-Rock songs. 
[01:19:30]  Right.  E-Rock's got to be happy about that.  E-Rock comment?  No comment, huh?  Oh, boy.  Oh, he's looking at me now.  Why aren't you commenting?  Comment.  It's radio.  My old friends are digging the E-Rock songs.  I'm not making that up, by the way.  They actually said that to me.  Oh, God.  Buzzy said that.  But when you say, hey, Buzzy, what's up?  He goes, Just Jeff.  His new name is Just Jeff. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Just Jeff.  We're all moving past our college nicknames, finally.  Oh, really?  Finally, after all these years.  So he's Just Jeff now.  You can't say Jeff.  It's Just Jeff.  You can't say Just Jeff?  Why?  Because he doesn't want people to think he's buzzy anymore.  He's a responsible human being.  Sure.  With a job that is a complete nightmare.  You want to talk about flying.  He was giving me his itinerary for the week alone.  He's got to fly to like three different cities this week alone. 
[01:20:30]  With three kids at home.  Lives out of the Atlanta area now.  I can imagine having trouble.  That's his job, though.  He flies all week to a couple different cities minimum a week.  Week after week after week.  That's just a...  That is not a fun gig.  But that's always been my dream, to be able to travel the country and see it.  But I would imagine those people like Buzzy, it got old a long fucking time ago.  That, oh, wow, I get to see every city in America gets fucking old. 
[01:21:00]  Dude, it's probably exactly like Ed Norton described it in fucking Fight Club.  When he's just going one city to another on the plane, sitting there lethargic.  Right.  It has to turn into that.  But, I mean, the first year or two when you get to see every city.  Hey, I travel a lot.  It's great.  Got to see Seattle.  Got to see Austin.  Got to see Chicago.  And then back to Chicago.  Got to see Seattle again. 
[01:21:30]  And back to Chicago.  Right.  I don't know how they do it.  Oh, why do you got Sean F's E-Rock song page up, Sam Roberts?  I did not do this, E-Rock.  Sam did this.  That is a page of nuggets right there.  We were talking about it.  Oh.  Oh, by the way, is the new podcast up and running?  Oh.  Yes.  Whoa.  Yes.  We weren't allowed to, we couldn't, I should say, do the intros this week because of my  little fucking detour.  I mean, it's not on, you know, you have to wait for it.  If you have it, if you're subscribed to it on your phone. 
[01:22:00]  Right.  Then it's up.  All right.  And if you're looking at the RSS feed, then it's up.  But of course, it takes iTunes, you know, a little while.  Right.  So.  It's up.  If you're, if it's on your phone, you got it.  So the Open Anthony Show podcast once a week, we got it out there.  Episode two.  Episode two is how long?  It's 59 minutes and 56 seconds.  Just under an hour.  We're trying to keep these to an hour.  Maybe a little, maybe a little more every once in a while, but about an hour, hour and 
[01:22:30]  15 tops.  And this week, what are we featuring?  Tippi Tom watches Sophie's Choice.  Oh, God.  I love that one.  Yes.  Our homeless friend was, broke down bawling over Sophie's Choice and then dissects the  movie and the choice she had to make.  Yes.  Trace Atkins in studio with Colin Quinn and Tom Papa and Guy Fieri.  That was strong.  Great.  And Roland can't say Bonaduce.  Oh, man. 
[01:23:00]  That's going back.  Taking her right back.  Well, we punish him, right?  Every time he said it wrong.  Well, you start, yeah, because you realize you couldn't get him to say it right, so you  end up having to, that's when the show was in its mousetrap stage, where you guys were  obsessed with mousetraps.  Well, I was and brought him to the show.  So you made Roland put his hand in a mousetrap when he couldn't say any.  So we got two old bits this week.  That's cool.  Yeah.  Because people are really digging the older bits because it's stuff we just can't get  to on a regular basis anymore on our channel. 
[01:23:30]  And hey, guys, stay tuned, because at the end of the podcast, there's a little nugget.  The Opie and Anthony nugget.  Nugget.  That little piece of shit that finally drops into the toilet.  Piece of shit that, even after flushing, miraculously, it's still just bobbing around in the bowl.  You see it go down and it comes right back up.  Oh, it comes back.  The good old nugget.  Yep.  You shake that shit loose.  You shake it loose so the wiping isn't as bad. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, my God.  That's all that is sometimes.  If you would have just waited for the little nugget to finally fall out, then your wiping  wouldn't be as bad.  Oh, my God.  Do you understand this?  I've, uh, yeah.  Yeah, I get it.  We don't want to announce what the little Opie and Anthony nugget is this week?  We can.  It don't matter to these people.  No, it's the, uh...  We decided to put up the George Brett shit story.  Yeah.  Which is great, because then if you download the podcast, you have those little nuggets 
[01:24:30]  for yourself.  Yep.  I was too busy with what I had to do, but someone tweeted a link to a website that breaks  down the entire George Brett shit story.  With pictures and everything.  It's really, really funny.  Because they're trying to figure out when the story took place, because it's one of these  things that kind of happened, obviously, but it was before the internet was really organized,  so people couldn't really figure out what year the clip was from, so then they break that  down by him mentioning some of the players, I guess, in the clip. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, right.  Or there was a video, originally, of him telling the story.  Yeah, that's what it was.  And that sort of just was kind of thrown online with no real time stamp.  But it's pretty funny.  If I find it, I'll tweet it.  Or that guy should just send it to me again, and I'll retweet it.  It was pretty funny.  Anyway.  You got to see the Wolf Blitzer clip with the atheist girl.  Oh, yeah.  I saw that.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, so you don't need Melissa? 
[01:25:30]  Melissa, what's up?  Hey.  Oh.  You have to watch it.  Wolf Blitzer looks like a fucking moron, and he's correcting some little boy's leg.  It's the craziest one.  Wait, Wolf Blitzer is...  Oh, there's the little kid.  Okay, this is it?  All right.  We got the clip.  Thank you so much.  Thanks.  Yeah, thanks, Melissa.  Oh, boy.  Wolf Blitzer.  Tornado survivor.  Something about an atheist.  All right.  Let her rip.  That's your dad. 
[01:26:00]  We're happy you're here.  You guys did a great job.  Pause.  If Wolf Blitzer touched my fucking kid like that, I'd punch him in his teeth.  He grabbed the little child's calf.  What gives him the right to fucking touch the kid?  His little calf.  How old is that little fucking rug rat?  I would...  I would...  Two-ish.  Two-ish.  And he grabs his little calf and then rubs his thumb on the kid's little calf.  That's the part that bothered me.  And goes to grab the foot.  But the kid moves a little. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  Wolf is a creep.  Oh, it's Uncle Wolf.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we're happy you're here.  You guys did a great job.  And I guess you got to thank the Lord, right?  Yeah.  Do you thank the Lord for that split-second decision?  I, I, I'm actually an atheist.  Oh, you are.  All right.  Don't say to you.  But you made the right call.  Yeah.  Yep.  We are here.  And for...  And, you know, I don't blame anybody for thanking the Lord. 
[01:27:00]  Of course not.  So...  Hey.  All right.  Andrus, want to try one more time?  He's touching the kid's hand.  Ah, the kid's smacking him.  He's smacking him.  He's like high-fiving him or something.  That wasn't bad.  That wasn't that bad, the whole atheist thing.  So...  Wolf Blitzer, you know, digs the Lord.  So he asked that question.  And she answered it fine.  And he was cool with it.  And then she was like, yeah, other people thank the Lord.  I have no problem with that, so...  It is a strange situation, this religion thing, when it comes into here.  Because, obviously, a lot of people there, the Bible Belt, whatever you want to call it,  very religious. 
[01:27:30]  And they're standing in the wreckage.  And they're thanking the Lord.  Right.  I want to thank God.  Oh, this is wonderful that we're alive.  But who did it?  Like, your Lord, your God...  Don't question it.  Did it in the first place!  You can't question the Lord.  I know, that's just it.  He does his things.  Why thank the entity that did this in the first place?  And if you were the Lord, wouldn't you take out the atheist woman and... 
[01:28:00]  Right.  And save the one that is preaching your...  Dude, she's just as...  Your lessons?  She's just as fine as someone who sat there praying...  Right.  ...until they were, like, a horse.  That's why, I mean...  I don't know if you should throw the, you know, the Lord thing into this if you're a reporter down there.  Because I'm sure, yeah, there were some big Lord people that fucking perished.  Yeah.  But it was God's way.  It's God's will, and it's... 
[01:28:30]  He gets pissed.  Mysterious.  Mysterious ways.  And you gotta sit there and go...  You two said it best.  Yes.  He moves in mysterious ways.  Mysterious ways.  Yes.  Of course.  It's all right.  It's all right.  It's all right.  It's all right.  I don't know.  Oh, yeah.  You're a home of rock and roll.  I want to be a voice guy for a rock stage.  Yeah?  You're a home of rock and roll. 
[01:29:00]  Who wants to hire me?  Pretty good.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  All right.  Let's play this.  We'll be back.  We'll play a little of this.  Fuck it.  When a daylight is to fill up your room, you've been living underground, hating from a cat.  You've been running away from what you don't understand.  Look.  She's sleeping. 
[01:29:30]  You're sliding down.  She'll be there with you on the ground.  It's all right.  It's all right.  It's all right.  She moves in mysterious ways.  It's all right.  It's all right.  It's all right.  She moves in mysterious ways.  You're going to take a dive with your sister in the rain. 
[01:30:00]  Let her talk about the things you can explain.  The dirt is the heel.  The hurt is the spear.  If you want to kiss the sky,  You better learn how to knit on your knees, boy.  She's the lady.  She turns high.  She sees a man inside the chair. 
[01:30:30]  It's all right.  It's all right.  It's all right.  It's all right.  She moves in mysterious ways.  It's all right.  It's all right.  It's all right.  It's all right.  It's all right.  It's all right.  It's all right.  It's all right.  It's my day.  It's the light of my night.  Thank you. 
[01:31:00]  Thank you. 
[01:31:30]  Thank you.

[01:43:00]  Yeah.  I'm very surprised.  The Smiths, right?  D-Rock.  54 today, Morrissey.  That's...  You know.  Were you into the Smiths?  No.  The weirdos were into the Smiths.  Right.  I like a tune or two here and there, but...  Yeah.  His fans, the Smiths in general, their fans, holy fuck.  Hardcore.  Weirdos.  I would say they were weirdos. 
[01:43:30]  No.  I think so.  It's kind of...  Actually, I don't mind this one.  But I'm very surprised D-Rock went with this.  Why?  Fucking Raymond Therick.  Yeah, we didn't...  Oh, yeah.  We weren't on the air.  He's dead.  You know how he died?  Oh.  I heard he had the big casino.  A long battle with bile duck cancer. 
[01:44:00]  What the fuck?  Oh, my God.  Where's the bile duck again?  It's like in here somewhere, right?  No, it's down in your...  Like, by your liver.  It's one of those just little tubes down there?  Yeah.  It's a...  Yeah, it's a liver thing.  Good old Ray Manzerk.  He was a trip.  How old a gentleman was he? 
[01:44:30]  He was 70-something, I would say.  Right?  72, 73.  What are we looking at?  When the music's over...  What did Ray look like back in the day?  What did he look like back in the heyday of the Doors?  He went with the sideburns.  Let's take a look.  Let's take a look.  74, by the way.  Down memory lane.  74, Ant.  Told you.  74 is the magic age.  If you can get past 74, you're going to make it to 85. 
[01:45:00]  He was groovy.  Yeah, he was.  Look at that 60s do.  That straight hair brushed to the side.  He was all right, man.  He was always good for a sound bite, that guy.  When the music's over...  Yeah, he doesn't have those big fucking pork chop sideburns.  Ant's not a big Doors fan.  No.  I love the Doors.  I love the Doors.  Turn out the lights.  Turn out the lights. 
[01:45:30]  So, uh...  Turn out the lights.  Who's left?  You got John Densmore's left.  Ah, yeah.  And you got the Robbie Krieger there.  Robbie Krieger.  He's a little bitter, right?  Isn't Robbie Krieger bitter?  No, John Densmore was the bitter one.  I don't know if he's changed his tune in recent years, but he certainly spent a lot of years being bitter.  Yeah.  He was lucky to be in that fucking band.  Who is he kidding?  Ray Manzurick, Robbie Krieger, and fucking Jim Morrison.  Damn brilliant. 
[01:46:00]  That was it, huh?  Densmore, I would say not so much.  Densmore was like kind of a jazz drummer.  And I think that's why he's bitter.  I think he really wanted to make it in the jazz world.  Oh, he looks angry.  Oh, my God.  That's what he looks like.  Damn.  He's looking all like, ah, you motherfucker.  Would you fuck with that guy?  No.  Hell no.  That's a badass.  Iraq, you like the Doors?  No, not really.  Why?  Why don't people like the fucking Doors?  I understand, and I can appreciate what they've done, but I just not. 
[01:46:30]  If I had to listen to it, I'd say no.  By the way, you could have kind of done a twofer there.  You got the tornado with the people praying to the Lord,  and you got the Ray Manzurick dying.  You could have done the you can't petition the Lord with prayer.  I hate that.  Why?  Could you get that one for Anthony?  He loves it.  He loves it.  Do you like any Doors songs?  I know you don't, like, search it out, but if one comes on, you're like, 
[01:47:00]  all right, I kind of like this one.  L.A. Woman?  No.  I'll go with the hits for you.  Any of those fucking played out goddamn things?  Roadhouse Blues?  I know you don't like the fucking blues shit.  Back in years ago, they were already so burnt out.  God, I loved them.  I can't fucking...  Well, what I did with the Doors, I really got into them,  but I only knew the Doors from the radio, and then I went deep.  And then radio stations, because like you said, the burnt out factor was ridiculous. 
[01:47:30]  They started playing, like, Alabama's song and Waiting for the Sun and Backdoor Man.  Those weren't the songs they played at first.  Waiting!  Waiting!  Waiting for you to...  Come on, Don!  I didn't mind.  For one of the big hits that, you know, was played over and over again, I didn't mind.  Come on, come on, come on, come on!  Oh, God, that was like the hit of hits.  That was the hit of hits. 
[01:48:00]  That was the one that everyone enjoyed.  Yeah!  No, I don't even think I like this one.  No.  No.  Come on, come on, where is it?  Come on, come on, come on, come on, now touch me, babe.  Can't you see that I am afraid?  I love this voice, but the music as well is terrific.  Just terrific. 
[01:48:30]  Why won't you tell me what she said?  It's like the horns in this.  It's kind of...  This song of horns is pretty fucking cool.  Awesome.  Wah!  Yeah, yeah, they fill things out.  Till the heavens start the rain.  One of the more produced Doors tunes.  Yeah, yeah.  There's a lot of shit going on in this song right here.  They went over the top of this one.  Yeah, yeah.  For you and I.  For you and I. 
[01:49:00]  American poet Jim Morrison.  Oh, he's just writing down drivel and babble and stone fucking bullshit.  And they're like, oh, he's brilliant.  Well, that was a time where you could get away with that.  Yeah.  Try just writing down bullshit now.  Yeah.  Have fun.  Did you find You Can't Petition the Lord with Prayer?  Yeah.  Is that the actual title?  Because it's not in there.  No, it's...  Is it American Prayer?  Is that the one?  No.  Oh, my God.  Why can't I remember the name of the song? 
[01:49:30]  I can't petition the Lord with Prayer.  Holy fuck.  Help me out.  I'm waiting for somebody to pop it up here.  I'm having a...  What they call a brain fart.  Oh.  Is it just called Petition the Lord with Prayer?  No.  No.  There's a song called Petition the Lord with Prayer.  Uh-oh.  I don't...  Uh...  No.  Anyone?  That's not the name of the song.  Is it Soft Parade, maybe?  Yes.  I think it is Soft Parade.  I got that myself, by the way, fuckers.  Oh, well...  I didn't go to Twitter.  And then it comes in. 
[01:50:00]  The brain fart went away.  Yeah, of course it's Soft Parade.  I know this.  It just took me a second.  Let's hear that one so I could...  The Soft Parade, officially.  It's more Doris crap.  E-Rock, we don't have The Soft Parade in there?  No, the problem with the lead is some songs are listed as doors, other songs are listed  as the doors, so they don't show up in the same list.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, boy.  And Soft Parade's not showing up at all. 
[01:50:30]  Well, we got it.  Yeah.  We got it over here, E-Rock.  So you can turn down your shit.  Because Dan loves this.  He loves how this begins.  When I was back there in seminary school, there was a person there who put forth the proposition  that you can petition the Lord with prayer.  Why is he doing this?  Petition the Lord with prayer.  One more time.  Petition the Lord with prayer. 
[01:51:00]  Guess what?  You can't petition the Lord with prayer.  That's what they found out in Moore, Oklahoma, right, Ant?  I don't know.  You can't petition the Lord with prayer.  And then...  Oh, this is horrible.  It's terrible.  I must find a place to hide. 
[01:51:30]  A place to hide.  Good riddance.  To who?  All of them.  To Ray?  Oh.  Jim.  Ray.  Whatever.  What is that?  That sounds medieval.  Yeah.  What's that?  Calliope?  You're trying to make medieval sound cool.  It's that harpsichord.  What is it called, officially?  Harpsichord.  Lurch used to play one of those. 
[01:52:00]  Lurch, yeah.  The Addams Family.  The Addams Family.  But now we change the song right here.  Disco Doors.  Hey, get out on the dance floor, everybody.  Jim Marson and the Doors.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Who likes this?  Come on.  It's not one of my favorites.  It's terrible. 
[01:52:30]  Oh.  They're just jamming.  Yeah.  They're just jamming.  I would not listen to a second of this.  Any portion of it, either.  Look at Sam.  Sam's into it.  Oh, Sam hates it.  Sam hates it.  You know what I was digging on the other day?  Keith, the cop was turning me on to it.  I had a blast at my backyard.  Much to my neighbor's chagrin, I'm sure. 
[01:53:00]  Turn to that, James?  No, Drake.  Oh, yeah?  Drake, yo.  There's that song.  What's his new fucking...  Started from the Bottom?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's the shit.  Dude.  Can we play this?  It was hilarious.  It was blasted in my fucking yard.  You like Drake?  No, I don't like it.  I just thought it was hilarious.  Oh.  And the fact that my Jewish neighbors had to hear it.  Because he just throws nigger in, like, everything's like nigger.  Yeah, he just drops it.  It just drops like nigger. 
[01:53:30]  That word is not that powerful anymore.  It starts just like this.  Oh, wait a minute.  It's huge.  It's a big song.  Huge.  It's huge.  Started from the bottom, now we're here.  Started from the bottom, now my whole team fucking here.  Started from the bottom, now we're here.  Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga.  Started from the bottom, now we're here.  He just throws nigger in.  It's great.  Yeah, he does.  Started from the bottom, now my whole team here.  Nigga, started from the bottom, now we're here.  Unnecessary. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  Started from the bottom, now the whole team fucking here.  I done kept you real from the jump.  Living at my mama house, we'd argue every month, nigga.  I was trying to...  Nigga.  Yeah.  We'd argue every month, nigga.  Something about his mom.  That white Jewish lady.  Yeah.  I gave you the keys.  So you bring it right back, nigga.  Nigga.  I love the lady.  It's catchy.  It's a row, half a million for a show.  Started from the bottom, now we're here.  Something.  Ooh.  Started from the bottom, now the whole team. 
[01:54:30]  Oh my God, who's that?  Mm.  Mm-mm.  Oh my gosh.  Hi.  Hi.  Is this on here?  Who's she?  Pause.  Yeah, she's just a video girl.  How do you not like black girls?  Well, because she doesn't look like a black girl at all.  She's got black in her, right, Sam Roberts?  She looks like a black girl.  Yeah, well...  She looks like a black girl.  You see this broad in this video?  She's very attractive.  Holy fuck, what's her name?  I don't know. 
[01:55:00]  Is she a professional video girl?  I would assume so.  I don't know.  I think she might be a little more actress than a professional black video girl.  I feel like I would know that girl from something else.  She's quite attractive in this video.  Oh, nigga.  Oh, nigga.  Oh, nigga.  Oh, nigga.  It's kind of cool how he fits that in there.  It's fucking...  I mean...  I was laughing my ass off.  I was like, this is fucking fun.  Babe, I can't tell you anything else.  Let's take a look at her.  This is medicated lip ointment, but I want you to know with that being said, I still think 
[01:55:30]  you're straight gorgy, and I would love...  Pause.  Look at them tits.  She so needs to button one, two, at least two out of the four that are left.  Oh, that's perfect.  No, it just means if you're not buttoning those other two, you're down for some shit.  Mm-hmm.  Right?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I like that fucking weed.  She's down for some shit, especially if you're just in, like, a Kmart-type place. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  When you're butting that shit up, if you're just going in for some...  Butting that shit.  ...toilet paper and some fucking...  Not if you're in a motherfucking Drake video.  Yeah.  What are they doing?  Why are they fucking breaking this song down like this?  You throw a little skit.  Throw a little skit in.  It's all about a little skit.  I just want to hear the fucking...  So they have Goofy White Guy.  Right.  He's picking his beard with an Afro pic.  Right, right, right, right.  Staring right at her...  Titties.  He's a hipster, and he's an idiot, and she's fucking, you know, giving him the wood of it. 
[01:56:30]  Do you like that they're making fun of white people here?  It's hilarious.  I love it.  Yeah.  I could see it, you know, every day in every commercial on television, but that's okay.  All right, let's see what happens in this drink.  With a poor, stupid white guy.  I'll show you how I live.  Get the answers from the black people.  You can get based with me and, like, 18 of my best dogs.  Yo, your girlfriend's a little bit, man.  She sounds super pregnant.  Laquisha.  I'm gonna be all right.  Uh-huh.  You look just like Max Walker.  Another white guy.  She died last week.  She didn't die, but you look just like her. 
[01:57:00]  We can do, like, a double date or something crazy like that.  Um...  My treat.  Okay.  That's all.  That's all on me.  Come on, I'm a little kid.  I'll take care of you.  This is getting sucked.  Mouth like Mr. Italian guy comes over.  I look way different when I'm not in my work clothes.  All right.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's working in the drugstore.  He's still bowling.  Now we here.  Yeah. 
[01:57:30]  Started running bottom, now the whole team here, nigga.  What did he grow up?  Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry.  Yeah, I got it, nigga.  I can take a point.  I love it.  Ain't really much out here that's popping off without us, nigga.  We just want to play that way still.  I hate you.  I don't worry about me, give a fuck about you, nigga.  Just as a reminder to myself.  He used to be on Degrassi.  That's crazy.  Oh, fucking Degrassi. 
[01:58:00]  Teenagers watched him like, oh, yeah.  Now he's like, fuck you, nigga.  Yeah.  Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga.  No new niggas, nigga.  We don't feel that.  Fuck a fake friend where your real friends at.  We don't like to do too much explaining.  Stories stay the same.  I never changed it.  No new niggas, nigga.  We don't feel that.  No new niggas, nigga.  No new niggas, nigga.  We don't feel that.  We don't like to do too much explaining.  Yeah. 
[01:58:30]  Stories stay the same through the money and the fame.  Cause we started from the bottom, now we're here.  Started from the bottom, now my whole team's fucking here.  Started from the bottom, now we're here.  That's what I sing.  Started from the bottom, now I'm here.  Right.  And then I just use the word every, you know, last time I'm driving.  Except you didn't bring the whole team with you.  Like, you don't have a bunch of air conditioning guys with you.  No, cause I want to keep some of my money.  Don't drink, it's gonna end up like Hammer.  Yeah, you gotta bring the whole team with you.  You can't have a whole posse. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah.  It's an expensive cigar he's enjoying.  Yeah.  It's a catchy song.  There's no we in solo.  But what does this have to do about the doors?  Dolo.  Oh.  I'm kidding.  Yeah, right?  We're past the doors, that's fine.  Then there's another song Keith played, I can't remember though.  But he says, cause he hangs out with them A-Rab guys, you know?  And they go to the clubs every fucking night.  And he's like, dude, this song is so fucking huge in the clubs.  Really?  Huge!  And then there was another one that he just said is huge. 
[01:59:30]  And I had to blast that too, but I can't remember who did it.  You remember anything about it?  How's it go?  Niggas in it.  Okay.  Put that in the Google search.  Yeah.  I mean, it could have been true that James uses that word a lot.  Yeah?  Dude, there's only two.  My big.  I don't know.  There's only 20 words to this song that he just says over and over again.  That's all it takes to get a hit.  It has to be the right words though.  Right.  Yeah.  And one of those words has to be that M-bomb. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  That's a fun word.  Here's a...  What's the name of this song?  All Gold Everything.  I think this is it.  Yes, it is.  I was playing this on the after show.  This is it.  Yeah.  This is it.  I was blasting this, Todd.  But Troy may have been waiting for you to find out about this song for so long.  Yes.  Dude.  She's not like me.  And the video is amazing.  I was blasting this shit.  So you like this shit?  It's on a gold bicycle.  Dude.  Wait, hold on, hold on.  Pause this before Troy's in here all excited.  Come on.  What's going on, Troy? 
[02:00:30]  I've been waiting since January for you to see this video.  Oh, shit.  So why don't you tell us about it?  Because I bring it up to Sam and Sam gives it to you guys whenever you guys feel you're  ready to do it.  But January, when I came back from vacation, I was like, Anthony needs to see this fucking  video.  Oh, shit, yo.  So why would you bring it to our attention sooner?  Because if I bring this shit up, you go, no, we don't want to hear about that.  You guys have to be interested in it before I can bring it up.  We have a stockpile of stuff that we're waiting to give to you guys.  Yes, we'll get to it eventually.  It's all right.  It's all right.  Just like this.  Look.  Right.  I want to hear a few more of the things from the stockpile today. 
[02:01:00]  I got a good one.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's get this one first, though.  Yeah.  Let's hear this now.  Why did you want Anthony to see this so bad?  He just needs to see the video.  You'll know.  And I just, if you don't mind, if I could just stare at you while you watch this.  All right.  Like I said, Keith.  Is he going to be angry?  Probably.  No.  I don't know how you could not love this guy.  I think Trinidad James is the shit.  And then his song after this is so fucking funny.  It's Trinidad James.  The thing about Trinidad James is, and there's a weird thing going on in hip hop, that they 
[02:01:30]  are now just embracing every horrible negative stereotype and idea that white people have  about black people.  And just especially Trinidad James, more than probably anybody, is just embracing all of  it and showing all of it off.  Like, it's just ignorant nonsense.  Stignate.  Yeah.  Which you love.  I sure do.  All right.  Let's see this.  I live it.  And it's almost like rapping now.  Like, before, you'd look at, like, Biggie Smalls or, like, Jay-Z. 
[02:02:00]  And lyrically, they're amazing rappers.  But now it's become almost so bad, like, where they're not even rhyming, that it becomes good  again.  Wow.  Okay.  And a song like this, you'll hear it, and you'll go, like, whatever, for the first time.  But then when you hear it in the club, and people are going crazy, and you're like, wait  a second, I kind of like this.  I get it.  Keith said, the place comes apart when this fucking shit comes up.  And there's a line in this song that, on t-shirts, everybody has t-shirts. 
[02:02:30]  If you go down to, like, the beach, everybody at the fucking beach, those, like, gimmicky  t-shirts, they have a line from this song.  Let me hear a little more of it.  Like I said, it's blasting in my yard.  I'll bet you'll be able to guess the line when you hear it.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  This is Poppin' Molly, I'm Sweatin' Guy.  That's it.  That's the line. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I know it.  I know this one.  He loves jewelry.  Yeah, he loves jewelry.  Say it right.  It's jewelry.  Jury.  I got my jewelry.  You got the lowrider.  He's wearing a panda bear hat.  Yeah.  And he's got a puppy.  Oh, a hippo puppy.  He's at the apartment complex. 
[02:03:30]  The gangbangers in the fucking apartment.  My nigga.  They're holding guns and cash.  Yeah.  This is great.  Look at the gold shopping cart.  Everyone's face is blurred out.  Oh, shit.  He caught a motherfucker slipping.  With no scratches.  So don't tell me who tellin'. 
[02:04:00]  Nope.  Countin' money walkin' down the street.  Nothing's rhymin'.  Like, it's not.  No, no, no.  Why bother?  It's not a straight flex.  Err.  Err.  Woo!  Park the mile, I'm sweating.  Woo!  Civil War hat.  It's a Confederate Civil War hat.  Right, right.  It's the Confederate Army.  Which is gray.  The other side.  He's like a black hipster.  He's wearing a hat from the Confederacy.  He certainly has a Confederate hat.  Ghetto hipster. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  Two gold chances.  Gold rank.  It's none.  Got that.  Oh, Jesus.  Got that.  Them hot socks.  No shirt.  Oh, I'm stunt.  Okay.  Okay.  He hits the fuck niggas.  Oh, yeah.  He's not about them.  No.  Fuck them.  Fuck them.  Yeah, he's the shit.  My rank.  He's the Molly King. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Nigga, nigga, nigga.  That's great.  That's my favorite part of the song.  Gold on in my watch.  Yeah.  See, in the hook, he rhymes watch.  Yeah.  With watch.  And that's the hook.  That's the hook, right.  There's so many good rappers right now.  Him and 2 Chainz are my favorite rappers right now.  And by good rappers, you mean bad rappers?  Well, I mean, it's like horrible. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, man.  But you fall in love with it because it's so ridiculous.  Like, 2 Chainz, look up 2 Chainz, I'm Different.  Just to see a second of it.  What was the second song that you said was hilarious?  Oh, the hook to it goes, my side bitch is my main bitch because my main hoe ain't feeling  me no mo'.  That's a love song.  Yeah.  That's great.  Was that Lennon or McCartney?  That song is very catchy, by the way.  Oh, it's great.  Yeah.  What, I'll go with everything?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's fucking catchy.  You just gotta see a second of...  This is not as good as All Gold Everything.  It's not as good, but this is one of my favorite rappers right now. 
[02:06:00]  2 Chainz.  2 Chainz.  What is it?  Motherfucking 2 Chainz.  He's one of the biggest dudes right now, too.  Well, you know, 2 Chainz wasn't always known as 2 Chainz.  No?  No.  Well, he was part of Ludacris.  Remember Ludacris back in the 90s?  He was part of his crew disturbing the peace.  And he was known then as Titty Boy.  Why?  You know, I'm not sure.  Probably because he loves titties.  Yeah.  And he's also known as the Hair Weave Killer.  The Hair Weave Killer?  Yeah, because he says in his song, after your girl leaves me, she needs a hair salon. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, shit.  Because he's ripping out, you know, he's fucking the hair right out her head.  Right.  But this is, and then you'll see here, like, one of the big things now is, like, crazy-looking  jumpsuits.  That's what the hip-hop dudes...  One of the big things, right?  What, they're doing an Elvis thing?  Well, I mean...  They're taking the Elvis spirit, I would say, of just sort of over-the-top showmanship.  Uh-huh.  And on some real ignorant bullshit.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  All right. 
[02:07:00]  16 million views for 2 Chainz.  They go, I want to do something that nobody else is doing.  And before this, nobody else did it because it was completely stupid.  Right.  If this song isn't as good as the last one, why are we playing it?  Oh, you don't have to.  I don't know.  They just...  Well, we have to now, yeah.  Well, Troy wants to represent motherfucking 2 Chainz.  Yeah, I think...  Let's see some 2 Chainz.  Holy fuck, he looks scary.  Oh, yeah.  Like, he'll wear some, like, goofy shit and then also rob you.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:07:30]  2 Chainz.  2 Chainz.  2 Chainz.  Yeah, I'm different.  I'm different.  Yeah, I'm different.  Cops are behind him.  Of course they are.  With just cause.  With just cause.  Pull up to the scene with my cellar missing.  And he's in his boat just getting towed.  It's not actually in the water.  Ha, ha, ha.  Middle finger up till I call my danger.  I'm different.  What is that?  Yeah, I'm different.  Maserati?  What's he driving?  Yeah, I'm different.  Yeah.  I'm different.  Yeah, I'm different.  Pull up to the scene with my cellar missing. 
[02:08:00]  Pull up to the scene by my roof down.  Roof down.  When he said his ceiling's missing, he's referring to a convertible car, correct?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  Okay.  What?  Oh, 2 Chainz getting arrested.  No, they're arresting the cops.  Oh, wait a minute.  They decided to arrest the cops.  I got it backwards.  Yes.  They're arresting the cops.  Yes.  What did the cops do wrong?  They're fucking police.  Yeah.  They're fuck niggas.  They got a gun to his head.  I bet this doesn't go over well. 
[02:08:30]  Does this get many spins on the MTV?  It's got 16.3 million views.  God damn.  What did the cops do wrong that they had to be arrested by 2 Chainz?  Well, they don't want 2 Chainz dancing on his boat that's being towed down the street.  But you also missed that they were pulling planted little bags of cocaine from the socks  of the cop.  Oh.  Turning that shit around.  And you're missing it.  Turning that shit around is right.  Why are they boating on a trailer?  Because it's fucking cool. 
[02:09:00]  And he has a leopard print jumpsuit.  I see that.  He does.  And his chains.  Like, Ant, if you were on a boat, where would the boat be?  In the water.  All right.  Well, see, 2 Chainz is different.  Different.  Oh.  So where would you expect 2 Chainz's boat to be?  On land.  On land.  Oh, and he doesn't get arrested.  No.  He arrests the cop.  Right.  And he's different.  And he wears a leopard print jumpsuit.  Does he have a job?  Yes.  That would be different.  Does he pay his own way? 
[02:09:30]  Look, he's about that money.  Did he decide not to have children because it would be the responsible thing to do?  That I can't guarantee.  See what I'm getting at here?  Yeah.  I guess some of the stereotypes that he's breaking are the wrong stereotypes.  You think the boys appreciate that they're being arrested in this video?  No.  You think they're just going to let that go?  Or are they going to pull this guy over every single time they can?  I like your video there.  Arrest the cop.  2 Chainz.  2 Chainz has got a couple bangers.  Yeah.  Like making out with old white women. 
[02:10:00]  You know.  Yeah, yeah.  We got Jordan from Atlanta calling in.  Let me see what he wants.  Jordan, go ahead.  Hey, I was going to tell you guys, you need to check out All Roles Everything.  It's an E-Rock version of that Trinidad James song.  Oh, yeah.  There's a lot of spoofs.  Yeah, everybody spoofed that video.  Everyone loves spoofing.  Although, that's not to say...  All Roles Everything.  That's not to say Sean F. should not take a stab at the master.  He should probably run with it.  No, he should not do that. 
[02:10:30]  He's been killing it.  Oh, Sean F.?  Yeah.  Yeah, E-Rock doesn't appreciate it.  I don't understand.  Like, I mean, it just turns in so quickly to piggy, piggy, piggy.  Oh, it does.  Piggy, piggy.  There's a million ways you can go with that one.  Definitely.  Yeah.  Yeah, 2 Chainz is downright scary.  Yeah.  Why 2 Chainz?  That's more impressive than 1 Chainz?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's different.  Yeah, he's different.  So, a guy's going to come out and be 3 Chainz, and that's going to fuck over 2 Chainz's whole thing.  No one's going to fuck with 2 Chainz.  No, not 2 Chainz.  You don't fuck, you just don't fuck with 2 Chainz.  Why?  Start being 3 Chainz. 
[02:11:00]  Be 4 Chainz.  Because he's hot.  He's on fire right now.  He has another song, birthday song.  I'll be Infinity Chainz.  Oh, shit.  And then you'll be Infinity Plus 1 Chainz.  Plus 1.  Remember that stupid-ass shit?  Here comes Infinity Plus 2 Chainz.  Infinity Plus 2 Chainz.  That's pretty good.  Get Mr. 2 Chainz on the phone.  Mr. 2 Chainz.  We've got to help him out a little bit.  Mr. Chainz.  Mr. Chainz.  Mr. Chainz.  Also known as 2 Chainz.  Yeah, we're very concerned that someone's going to come around and be 3 Chainz. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  Do you have a strategy when that happens, sir?  So if he's walking around here, we open the door and you'll yell out,  Yo 2!  I'll go, Yo 2 Chainz!  Yo 2!  Yo 2!  Yeah, why not?  Yo titty boy!  People appreciate when I yell at them.  I don't know if that's true.  I've got a few people in here from just yelling at them.  So you were in your backyard just bumping Trinidad James and Drake yesterday?  Cranking it.  That's fucking awesome, dude.  Cranking it.  2 Chainz got arrested in Maryland.  Dude, he gets arrested all the time. 
[02:12:00]  That ain't no thing.  Eric in Baltimore.  Ballmore.  What's up, guys?  Ballmore.  Ballmore.  Yeah, 2 Chainz was in Maryland, and he got pulled over and had a bowl of weed in his  car, and they held him all night and took pictures.  It's a story on TMZ.  Just one bowl?  Oh, yeah.  They held him all night.  This is the story where the cops...  Well, they held him all night because they didn't appreciate being arrested in his video.  This is what I'm getting at.  Yeah, but then this picture came out, and 2 Chainz said that the cops then said, oh,  can we get a picture with you? 
[02:12:30]  Why not?  He's a celebrity.  But then the cops said, no, he asked for a picture with that.  Like, there was controversy about that.  Ah.  Because you're not supposed to arrest somebody and then ask for a picture with them.  Well, 2 Chainz might have asked for the picture and then flipped that shit.  Right.  And said, look what these guys want, a picture with me.  But then the cops should be smart enough to know.  To not take a picture with the guy.  Right.  And by the way, what the fuck are they arresting people with a bowl for?  Or, that's like, it's ridiculous at this point.  It's called racism.  Um, no.  It's called silly drug laws. 
[02:13:00]  Wow.  Yeah, we have some silly drug laws.  That apply to everybody.  You're absolutely right.  But I mean...  And it's like they're probably trying to see what else is in the car.  Exactly.  I mean, that is, you're just using, you know, that for probable cause to search, because  I'm sure there was a gun on the car.  Well, but that gun was hit...  Oh, yeah, it was in a trap.  Yeah, a little trap action.  You gotta turn on the fucking defroster, then you gotta hit the blinker on the left side,  then the right side twice.  Oh, twice.  Open the glove.  Yeah.  And then you gotta...  Tap the fucking radio.  And that thing opens up on the door, and there's a gun. 
[02:13:30]  It was very funny hearing Trace Atkins talk about his gun charge and how they just kind  of let him off the hook, since Lil Wayne did a year in jail for the same thing, finding  a gun on his tour bus.  Yeah, but Trace Atkins...  He's an American hero.  And he doesn't look scary.  Is that it?  The tattoos on the face?  Yes!  That scares people.  Did Lil Wayne write a song about the fucking troops?  No, he's more about the kind of fucking bitches and...  Oh, right.  Scissor.  Scissor.  Yeah, he loves Cody. 
[02:14:00]  Is he still on the scissor?  Oh, yeah.  He's still doing it, even though he had some things happen, possibly?  He specifically said he will not stop doing scissor.  He's having seizures.  He's been very clear about that.  He's having seizures.  He just doesn't want to live long.  How old is he?  27-ish?  28, maybe?  I think he's in his 30s now.  Is he in his 30s already?  Early 30s.  Can he start really young, though?  Yeah, he's really, really young.  He's a real little kid.  I'm going to go with 28 still.  Lil Wayne.  He's 30.  Fuck!  He's 30. 
[02:14:30]  He'll be 31 in September.  All right.  Fair enough.  He's a young wheezy, baby.  He's all about that lean.  Yeah.  All right, we're going to break.  You know what I want?  Bacon?  No.  I want a fucking ice cream sandwich.  Why?  I don't know.  Oh, let's get ice cream sandwiches.  I just had a craving for an ice cream sandwich.  What kind, though?  I just like your basic fucking ice cream sandwich.  It doesn't have to be fancy.  Or it gets all in your fingertips.  Yeah, I don't mind, you know.  Isn't that the worst?  They've got to figure that shit out.  Well, you kind of use a napkin. 
[02:15:00]  Hold it with a napkin.  Oh, that's how you do it?  Yeah, I don't like the...  Is that how people do it?  Well, as an adult...  I get the fingerprints.  As a kid, you would just get that and fucking run around.  Oh, you drove me nuts.  With filthy hands and snot on your face.  Can you scrape it off in your teeth?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now it's in between your teeth.  You want me to send Sal out for some ice cream sandwiches?  Send Sal out for some ice cream sandwiches.  He can't fuck this up, right?  No.  Vanilla ice cream fucking sandwiches.  Just go to the supermarket and get a box of it.  Right.  Just cheap.  I don't need any of those fucking big chocolate chip cookie fucking things. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, no.  Just basic.  I think you're right.  I don't need some fucking...  America's Choice.  Right.  Okay.  Right.  Store brand shit.  Let's just get ice cream sandwiches.  Oh, man.  Because I took off yesterday...  It's got a little better than America's Choice.  It's got like a name brand.  Oh.  Buyers or something.  I don't know.  Ice cream reminds me of Penn Jillette.  Because I fucking took off yesterday, we missed our opportunity.  Yeah.  Can we still talk to Penn Jillette?  No.  Never again.  So now we're past the celebrity apprentice and how Donald Trump fucked him on purpose? 
[02:16:00]  He's still got a phone.  I don't see why not.  I know.  I want to talk to him about it.  Shit.  That would have been fun yesterday.  Why don't we ring a pen, nigga?  Get him on the phone, nigga.  That's going to be stuck in my head now.  Oh, it's fucking great.  And Paul Anka, he was supposed to come in yesterday?  We fucked up Paul Anka thing.  My new pal.  Can I make a big prediction?  Yeah.  I'm fairly confident that we will be able to get Paul Anka back in studio.  Probably.  Because he gave me that nice gift and I feel like we're boys now. 
[02:16:30]  Well, he's asking to come back in again for no reason.  I know.  That's a little weird.  He was just here.  Yeah.  We don't like the needy celebrities.  The new Rat Pack.  Speaking of that, how's Barry Williams?  We like the in-between.  Yeah.  I swear to you, I'm too scared to apologize.  He was so mad.  We were talking about the road trip in a meeting yesterday.  Uh-huh.  And, you know, talking about locations and all this stuff.  And they're like, okay.  And then there's Branson.  Do we know?  And I was like, yeah.  Greg Brady's driveway.  I think we set that up. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, we forgot.  We wrote it down.  Wait.  Did you guys talk about Guy Fieri yesterday?  Yeah.  That's...  I want that to happen.  He knows where to stop.  Yeah, but don't you think we can find better food in, like, Austin than Guy Fieri?  But he's going to set up the whole fucking thing.  That's what's cool about it.  Like, he'll go to this place.  And then we'll go eat at the real joints.  Oh, shit.  We'll make believe, eat, and then we'll go somewhere else.  Because there was mention of him, like, sending food and catering.  And we were like, hmm. 
[02:17:30]  I think we've got to get Guy Fieri involved.  You are dissing Guy Fieri.  Yeah, I'm just saying.  There's so many different restaurants to go to.  No, we're going to get Guy Fieri involved.  You asshole.  You saw him.  ACDC.  For those about to rock.  He was around.  Are you about to rock or not?  He was rocking.  Want to play some ACDC today?  I'm feeling music today.  ACDC?  Like, let's do Thunderstruck or For Those About to Rock.  I like ACDC.  Oh, you're not an ACDC fan.  Again, they're all played out. 
[02:18:00]  Holy fuck, you're not an ACDC fan.  Not to the point where I could listen to their shit over and over to the point of, you know, getting all fucked.  What happened, Roland?  What's up, Roland?  Roland's supporting his friend, Guy.  Yeah.  I like Guy Fieri, and I want him involved in the bus tour.  He should, because, I mean, he'll help cook for free, too.  I know.  Be part of the whole demonstration.  Roland, don't listen to this asshole.  You make sure the Guy Fieri thing happens. 
[02:18:30]  Don't let Sam talk you out of it.  I'm just saying, we could also get TGI Fridays if we wanted to, probably.  It's like...  TGI Fridays, suck.  Yeah.  Hey, we're getting ice cream sandwiches.  I thought you said there's a place that has the best homemade ice cream sandwiches.  Yeah, but it's not like the store bought.  Yeah.  I like store bought.  Yeah, but we can't get the other guy now, can we?  What are they, fucking, like, delicately made and they're fucking baked every day?  An apple crème boulain on top.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's so special. 
[02:19:00]  What's their spin on the ice cream sandwich?  Because all these foodie people, they have to have that slight spin.  Right.  It's that homemade ice cream, and then it looks like a snickerdoodle on top.  Yes, snickerdoodle.  And then on the bottom, it's chocolate chip.  So you buy on that, you hit three different flavors.  And on top, there's a snickerdoodle.  Ah, there's a snickerdoodle.  And they have, like, small ones, medium ones, large ones, and then they have the square ones.  Yeah, but, I mean, just a regular ice cream sandwich is terrific.  Not really.  We don't have to fancy that shit up, do we? 
[02:19:30]  How much does one of their ice cream sandwiches cost?  Five bucks?  Six bucks?  God damn.  But I, the only one I do...  They got no bourbon in it or nothing?  Well, that's, that's a place called Butter and Scotch.  They make a booze one that's so good.  I could jerk off and put it in there.  Five dollars for ice cream sandwich.  And that's ice cream and a cookie.  But, with the way she wants a cookie.  Damn, that's a good ice cream sandwich.  Wow, that does sound good, though.  Yeah.  But you should get the Neapolitan ice cream sandwich.  I hate those.  That's fine.  I don't need three flavors. 
[02:20:00]  Oh.  I like vanilla.  What's going on, though?  I saw the hangover last night.  That's funny.  Three?  Yeah.  Oh, you saw three?  Yeah.  Did you stay awake?  Yeah.  Reviews are not good.  Now, what made it good that wasn't in the first one or the second one?  The second one sucked donkey balls.  This one's really funny.  Yeah, it's like the first and third.  I didn't think the second one sucked.  It's easy to say it sucked.  It was all right.  I mean, it's just the same story in Penny Cockwood or whatever the fuck.  Same story.  Zach Galifianakis is really funny. 
[02:20:30]  And there's no fucking way this happens.  I know.  I'm not going to be the hater on this one.  I like the hangover movies.  Spoiler alert.  I like one.  Back to Vegas.  Whoa.  I like two, and I'll see three.  It's funny.  Well, not according to Rotten Tomatoes.  I see if you're rotten ones there.  I think you're probably going to get in the interview.  It's like, eh.  Oh.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  What's the story with that End of the World movie?  World War Z?  No. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, the Seth Rogen?  Yeah.  Tonight is one screening, and then next week is another screening.  Like, who's in that?  Seth Rogen.  Franco, Michael Cera, Hermione.  Hermione, is it?  Yeah.  But I saw in the trailer, they say we got robbed by Hermione.  So she's playing.  They're all playing.  They're all playing.  Okay, that's what I was getting at.  What?  They all play themselves.  Right.  And it's Armageddon.  So it's Armageddon. 
[02:21:30]  But they're like Seth Rogen and Dave Franco.  Oh, they're the actual guys.  It's like Y2K.  Or not Y2K, but like the Mayan Sith.  Yeah, it's an apocalypse.  Yeah, it's an apocalypse thing.  And all these actors are hanging out with each other, and Craig Robinson is everybody.  Damon Bride.  Right, everyone.  Is it a comedy?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  It looks awesome.  It's called This is the End.  I've seen it tonight.  Oh, okay.  So they're playing themselves.  Heightened versions, of course.  Heightened versions.  All right.  And it's This is the End, and apparently a gateway to hell opens up, and Armageddon takes 
[02:22:00]  place, and there's, you know, there's dragons and evil doers, and fucking people are  getting...  The trailer is funny, because they're just basically referring to Michael Cera like he's  a piece of shit the whole time.  It's funnier knowing that they're playing themselves, though.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  Now it makes sense.  Can we see the trailer?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  This is the Red Band trailer.  Well, hello there, Machinima.  That's you.  Go see our movie.  This is the end.  Comes out this June.  Machinima.  Is that McBride? 
[02:22:30]  Danny McBride.  He's in it, too.  Yep.  The whole...  The whole...  The whole...  That whole game.  Every Apatow person.  Seth!  I have the best we could ever play him.  James Franco's having a giant party.  Ha-ha!  Yes!  Everybody drunk out.  Oh, my God.  If I don't fucking start tonight, I'm going to blow my brains out.  What's up, Rihanna?  What?  Fucking pale.  110 pounds.  Hairless.  Holly has a huge cock.  Don't fucking touch my bumper, bitch.  It's a weird face.  So hot.  Rihanna smacked my heroin. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  Why did you just fucking blow on me?  Don't worry.  It's just heroin.  Are you shitting me?  I'm just kidding.  It's cocaine.  That's McLovin.  That's McLovin.  They're all in it.  Yeah.  Now, uh-oh.  There's rumbling.  There's a...  The ground is opening up.  What the fuck?  Oh, man.  Zach, come on.  Get the hell out of me.  Zach.  It's too late for you.  You're already in the hole. 
[02:23:30]  Get it.  Get the fuck off me, a thief.  The sheriff's office is urging people to stay in their homes right now.  Segal's dead.  Crumhouse is dead.  Michael Cera's dead.  Michael Cera's dead.  Isn't it bad?  It's already going crazy out there, guys.  I'm not leaving, okay?  I'm a victim.  When I was a kid, I had man titties.  The bullies held me down.  The kiddie fucked me.  We are out here.  We pretend it'd be hard, man.  Yeah.  We stopped this baby shit. 
[02:24:00]  Helicopter.  It's going to be fine.  Woo-hoo.  It's crap.  You okay?  No, I'm not okay.  Fuck your house, Franco.  What's your guess?  We should just stay in here, fortify this bitch, and take inventory of all the food and shit we have.  We got 12 bottles of water, 56 beers, half-ounce sour diesel, one ounce of shrooms, CT Crunch, a Milky Way.  Can I have that Milky Way?  No, you can't have the Milky Way.  It's my special food.  I like it.  I want some of the Milky Way.  I'd be pretty bummed if I don't at least get a bite of the Milky Way.  What you want, son? 
[02:24:30]  This is my game.  This is my game.  Get out of the way.  What you want?  Oh, shit.  What the hell?  Oh, my God!  I like the way people are being killed and they're certain.  Watson showed up.  Give me everything you have to drink.  There are six of us.  You cannot rob us.  I'm not fucking around.  Jesus.  Hermione just stole all of our shit.  This is way too visual.  Please, you can't let me in.  Things have gone crazy out here.  I'm sorry.  We just don't know you, man.  You could be like a looter or a rapist or a titty fucker. 
[02:25:00]  I'm not a rapist.  You want a titty fucker?  If you want me to titty fuck you, I will.  So I'm going to be loving it.  Let's go get out of here.  Ah!  That looks funny.  That was Patrice's part.  I know.  Every time I see him, I think.  And he came in here.  He's great.  He's an awesome guy, Craig Robinson.  That movie looks fucking great.  It looks kind of funny.  I like it.  Shit, I could see this today.  Yeah.  What time?  Seven.  No, I can't do it today. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, damn.  When's an additional screening?  The next one is at seven next week.  Next what day?  I think...  I don't know.  Don't say Monday.  It's not Monday.  Monday's home night.  Getting your meditation on?  I might go to next week's screening, my friend.  Go tonight!  I can't.  I'm pretty busy.  What if you're meditating and you can't get the lyrics to Start It From The Bottom out  of your head?  How do you do that?  You gotta bring it back to center, my friend.  Go back to that fucking mantra.  But what if you keep coming back to Start It From The Bottom? 
[02:26:00]  Then you're a horrible meditator.  Start It From The Bottom.  What?  What if that's your mantra?  Oh, that could be a good mantra.  Start It From The Bottom.  Now the whole cool fuck in here.  Nigga.  Start It From The Bottom.  Now we're here.  Nigga.  Wait, maybe I could get a babysitter tonight.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Make it your clean lady.  E?  I was watching the trailer again.  Did you see they're making fun of Brett Ratner's Skyline movie?  Oh, they were?  There's a scene.  I guess they're like in a convenience store or something where these blue lights just 
[02:26:30]  shoot through the ceiling and they're all just frozen like that.  Uh-huh.  That was the whole point of Skyline.  Oh, it was?  Yeah.  It's some kind of fucking Armageddon thing.  Yeah.  They're beaming people up.  That looks damn good.  Kevin Hart, Rihanna, Aziz Ansari, Mindy Kaling, Michael Cera, Emma Watson, Danny McBride,  Craig Robinson, Jonah Hill, James Franco, Seth Rogen.  You guys a fan of Michael Cera?  Yeah.  He, uh, I love when he plays that guy that's, um, kind of awkward and uncomfortable in his 
[02:27:00]  skin.  I like when he does that a lot.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, you gotta pick and choose what films you're gonna check out, right?  Yeah.  Just to make sure he's got that character going on.  Yeah, because he has a lot of range as an actor.  Yeah.  But for me, it's when he's very awkward, uncomfortable in social situations and just literally uncomfortable  in his skin.  Yeah.  I like when he does that role.  He's also good in the role he plays in Arrested Development.  Which is what?  Well, he's like this kind of like, he's a skinny, he's kind of like an awkward kid, he's a little 
[02:27:30]  weird, left of center.  A little uncomfortable?  A bit uncomfortable in his own skin.  In his own skin?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  I guess so.  All right.  I like, all right.  Yeah.  Oh, that's a little different, so I'll see the rest of the film.  Arrested Development.  Did you see Superbad?  He was good in that.  He was good in that?  Yeah.  Who did he play in Superbad?  Well, he played, he was Jonah Hill's friend.  Right.  Jonah Hill was kind of the larger, he was a bit confident, even though he's a bit of a  geek.  Whereas Michael Cera, he was also a geek, but a little more of the sort of awkward, not 
[02:28:00]  terribly comfortable in his own skin.  How was he in like social situations?  Not great.  Especially with girls.  That's great.  He didn't know how to, he touched a girl's breast by mistake and that was, you know, just  terribly uncomfortable.  What about that superhero one he was in there?  Scott Pilgrim versus?  Yeah.  Oh, that was good.  E-Rock, what did he play in that one?  Scott Pilgrim.  Yeah.  And he was just, you know, this shy guy who was a little insecure.  Oh. 
[02:28:30]  Not really confident.  Doubted his abilities, it was a little awkward at times.  Would you say he was uncomfortable, I don't know, like in his skin?  Yeah, a little sheepish.  A little sheepish.  What about that movie where the pregnant brought?  Juno?  Yeah, Juno.  Juno was good.  Oh.  That was a little more dramatic than the other movies.  Yeah.  One of the X-Men girls was in that.  He loved, I remember in that movie he loved Tic Tacs.  Right.  But at the same time, as far as social situations go, he was kind of awkward. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, wow.  Just a bit uncomfortable in his own skin.  Really?  Yeah, he was kind of not just quite on the same page as everybody else.  So I gotta go back and see that movie, because that seems a little different.  That was a little different than usual.  It was fun.  A little different than usual.  It was fun.  Hmm.  Yeah.  So, I mean, there's kind of a whole cornucopia of different...  He'll have a nice long career.  The many faces of Michael Cera.  Yes.  I like when an actor has reign.  Yeah.  He should fucking just hit the gym for like a year.  Get fucking completely roided out and just do action movies, like fucking old Vietnam 
[02:29:30]  action movies.  That would be great.  Look at him.  Yeah.  Oh, did you guys see Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist?  That's awesome.  Oh.  Yeah, you saw it, Roland, right?  It's a love story, but it's a comedy.  Roland, no offense, but is there any movie that isn't awesome?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Seriously.  He just likes the way pictures move.  Yeah, name one movie that wasn't awesome, because you say that to almost every movie  we bring up.  I just have a list at home to keep it myself. 
[02:30:00]  I got boo.  What was the last movie you saw that you hated?  Oh, good question.  Hmm.  Dislike.  Roland, comment?  I remember.  Is she Jennifer Schmucks?  No.  Oh.  I hated that movie.  He saw it.  He saw it.  He doesn't want to say.  It was funny.  That movie blew.  It wasn't funny.  Is it coming of age?  Is it coming of age?  It's coming of age.  What?  There's all adult men.  Yeah, I know, but it's like, look at this guy. 
[02:30:30]  Horrible.  He's a crazy friend.  Coming of age.  He's a schmuck.  We all have a schmuck who's a friend, so yeah.  The idea was good, but they didn't go all in.  They played it safe with their concept.  Not a funny movie.  I hated it.  Did we talk to any of the guys for that movie?  No, you caused quite a stir, because you went to see the movie, and then based on your  opinion of the movie, you canceled the director the day of the interview.  Yeah, because I couldn't fake it.  Who directed that movie again?  It was a big guy.  Yeah, it was Jay Roach. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, it was Jay.  Who did Meet the Parents.  But see, this is what happens sometimes.  These guys insist that we see the movie, because they just assume, oh God, they're going to  love the movie.  And then we get in a bad spot.  We go see the movie, and we go, oh my God, I hated it.  And now we've got to talk to the guy.  Sometimes it's better not to see the movie, because then, you know, we don't know if  it's bad yet.  Yeah, just follow my lead.  Fantastic.  Could have just talked to him.  He did, because he did Borat and Austin Powers and Meet the Parents.  But the problem was, we would have had to get to dinner with schmucks eventually, and 
[02:31:30]  I couldn't fake that at all.  I hated that movie.  I hated it.  It wasn't bad.  He did the campaign.  I watched the campaign.  That was funny.  That was funny.  Oh, he makes funny movies.  Unfortunately, that one is going to be one of the bombs.  Eh, you've got to have a bomb.  In his career.  Was it because Paul Rudd was in it?  Oh, God.  You know, now, Paul Rudd is one of those actors.  He's a fun actor.  Versatile is the first word that comes to my mind.  Extremely.  Yeah.  Extremely versatile.  You know when you do that word association thing, and you say something, and then you 
[02:32:00]  just, the second I hear, I'm just, Paul Rudd, versatile.  No, what he does well is, like, he'll change his look.  Like, sometimes he'll have longer hair.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  If I can put on, like, you know, he'll grow out his sideburns a little bit, or maybe he'll  just add a mustache.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Boy, you just can't tell that he's playing the exact same fucking character.  But he was great, and I love you, man.  Dude.  It was a great movie.  He lucked out.  He's one of those guys in Hollywood.  He's the go-to guy. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, Anchorman 2 is his next one.  But he plays the same fucking guy in every fucking movie.  Well, you mean the adult, awkward guy who's charming, but at the end of the day does have  his shit together.  Yeah.  It's interesting.  I'm kind of done with, like, the big studio comedies.  Yeah.  It's very hard to make a comedy that's funny the whole way through. 
[02:33:00]  But every once in a while, you get a good one, like The Hangover, when that first came  out.  Remember, that was different for the time.  For the time.  And now this new one that we just saw the trailer for, that looks like it's going to be a pretty  fucking funny comedy.  But it doesn't quite...  You're talking about those formula ones.  Yeah, yeah.  The formula ones and the...  Yeah.  Where everything has to look perfect.  And these guys are goofy.  Like, the cast of this is goofy.  They're in goofy films and stuff.  So I don't even put this on the same...  It's like when they just take, like, the Paul Rudd comedies.  It's...  That shit is just... 
[02:33:30]  It's the exact same movie.  It is.  They live in a perfect house, in a perfect world.  Just like the, you know, different fucking...  You're a little fucking dirt.  Dude.  You're a little dirt.  There's a couple of shows that I was screening on the...  I believe either the CW...  Yeah, I think it's the CW it was on.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  There's one, apparently.  Black family in the White House.  It's a black president.  And he's...  That's what's happening now. 
[02:34:00]  That was the news you were watching.  Oh, I was watching the news?  Yeah, that was CNN.  No way.  I thought that was fake.  I thought that was a...  Yeah.  No, there is.  It's...  There's a family.  The black...  Black president.  And the whole cast is like black.  Is it the CW or the WB, maybe?  Are they blacker than the Obamas?  They're both the same.  They're a little more ghetto than the Obamas?  Not really.  Oh, really?  No.  Not really.  Okay. 
[02:34:30]  You had a problem with it?  What?  It was...  You said it's a black family in the White House.  Yeah, I got a problem with that.  I don't understand.  No, it's just...  It's so bad.  Jack K is in it.  Jack K is back.  Jack K is in it.  Find out who's Jack K.  What show Jack K is in.  Because I saw that, and then you see other black actors in it that are real old, but  you look at them and go, oh, man, that's a good one. 
[02:35:00]  Nestle.  Nestle king-size fucking ice cream sandwiches.  Why did you go king-size when he said he just won a regular?  That's good.  This will work.  Thank you.  What's it called?  The black family in the White...  A black family in the White House?  I don't know if that's...  Black first family...  What's it called?  Hmm.  I don't know what I was fucking watching.  Should we put these in the freezer for a little while?  They're a little mushy.  I love a good mushy fucking ice cream.  You like it mush?  Yeah, put them in your mouth.  Take the rest of the fucking ones and put them in the freezer, though. 
[02:35:30]  You like them mush?  A little mushy.  Then there was another show I was watching.  Where this guy, he's like, I guess, an actor, or he had one, like, movie or something, and  he gets convicted of something, and he has to teach at a South Central high school.  Right.  They show the high school.  It's like a regular scene, it looks like, from Welcome Back, Cotter, the hallway and  the lockers and everything.  And there's a security guy, like, as a background kind of player, walking around.  And the halls are full of the nicest, most attractive, well-dressed, well-spoken black 
[02:36:00]  people that are supposed to be students at this hardcore South Central fucking...  Oh, God.  It's ridiculous!  That's why you need a little dirt.  Dirty that shit up.  Oh, it's so bad.  Well, we're going to find clips from these shows after the break.  Yeah, yeah, let's do that.  We also got to talk about Jodi Arias.  She's babbling again.  Her hair looks good for being in prison.  Yeah.  It's very lustrous.  Oh, she cuts it off. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, pal.  Gives it to charity.  And Sergio Garcia in a little trouble today.  Oh, my God.  I think it's just funny what he said.  I don't know if...  Oh, I can't do that, Reed, right now.  I don't know if he was trying to be racist.  Oh, it's a good scene.  This is so good like this.  Do we have Anthony Wiener's announcement that he's officially running?  Yeah.  Okay, we're going to play that for everybody.  Okay.  Oh, the base jumper surviving the 1,000-foot fall.  Yeah, we still have a lot of shit to do. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  We're just babbling, wasting time.  We got real shit to talk about today.  Also, Wednesday is podcast day.  The second...  This is the second episode, officially.  Yes.  The second Opie and Anthony podcast is now available for your downloading pleasure.  Yeah, subscribe on iTunes.  It's the quickest way to get them.  And the first one did extremely well.  Way better than we thought.  And we could look at individual cities and stuff.  And fucking California likes the Opie and Anthony show, huh? 
[02:37:30]  Coming out in droves.  California is kind of tied with Boston, right?  Los Angeles is tied with Boston.  I mean, Los Angeles.  Not even just California.  Yeah, exactly.  Los Angeles.  Sorry.  As like a full market...  Right.  ...California is only second to New York.  Wow.  That's pretty good.  There's a huge...  That's weird because we were never really out there in California before satellite radio.  Yeah, a huge percentage of these people are coming from California, way more than we thought.  I did two or three L.A. trips in recent months, and I learned very quickly there's a lot of fans out there. 
[02:38:00]  It was pretty cool to see.  Very cool to see.  So the new podcast, Episode 2, is officially available.  You got two out of the three bits this week are old ones, so...  The only new one this week is Trace Atkins, because that was just so over-the-top good.  Trace Atkins.  And the Opie and Anthony nugget this week is going to be the George Brett shit story.  That we can't get enough of.  The bits are great, though, because we haven't heard them in a while.  Like, even us in the office, who hear this stuff every day, we're laughing out loud at this stuff.  Yeah, and they haven't been played on the channel in years. 
[02:38:30]  That's one reason why we wanted to get this podcast going.  Just a place to put some of these older bits for you guys.  This is so fucking good.  And hopefully take care of the people that can't afford satellite radio anymore.  And hopefully also turn people on to the Daily Show.  Our Daily Show, I should say.  Yes.  Because someone else has that fucking pretty much trademark now.  The Daily Show.  Our Daily Show, damn it.  So, go get the Opie and Anthony podcast, episode two.

A hankering.  But you see what world we live in?  Yeah.  Sal couldn't help himself, and he had to get the king-size.  Even though you said, look, man, I just want regular.  Yeah.  But people just can't help themselves.  He got the Nestle king-sized ice cream sandwich. 
[02:53:30]  And they were a little melty.  Right.  Perfect, right?  It was the perfect ice cream sandwich.  Holy shit.  But I'm an original guy.  That's why, you know, when it comes to crumb cake...  Oh, yeah.  En-t-i-t-i-t-i-t-i-t-i-t-i-t-i-t-i-t-i-t-i-t-i-t-i-t-i-t-i-t-i-t-i-t-i-t-i-t-i-t-i-t-i-t-i-t-i-t-i-t-i-t-i-t-i-t-i-t-i-t-i-t.  I'm going to get that word.  That's one you can't do either.  Where's the extra N?  It's after the E. 
[02:54:00]  I used to just say Entenmann's, but I'm learning it's Entenmann's.  I can't find that original goddamn coffee cake.  They just can't help themselves, is my point.  Chocolate swirl crumb cake.  Oh, my God.  Extra crumb.  No.  Apple crumb cake.  No.  No.  I just want the normal crumb cake. 
[02:54:30]  Troy Kwan.  I didn't forget.  Oh, my God.  I didn't forget, Sam.  Relax.  I got this.  Troy Kwan just walks in during the break and just out of nowhere just tells us something.  And we're like, why wouldn't you say that on the air?  Yeah.  Well, he's so Troy Kwan's back in studio.  At least he mentioned it.  Did you have an ice cream sandwich?  I did.  They were delicious.  They were good.  Oh, so good.  Right?  Yeah.  They were terrific.  I do enjoy a good ice cream sandwich. 
[02:55:00]  By the way, the downloads for the new podcast are doing very well already.  Thank you.  Ah.  Second episode of the Opie and Anthony podcast.  Every Wednesday, a new episode.  About an hour.  Maybe a little longer than an hour.  And this week, we got two old bits, one new bit.  So we're definitely going to try to get a bunch of old bits on there.  Sure.  So go download it in all the usual places.  Troy Kwan, what happened to you last night?  Well, I woke up in the middle of the night and I had realized this is the first time this 
[02:55:30]  has ever happened.  I shit myself.  I was going to say you're too old to be shitting yourself, but maybe not.  You shit yourself.  Like a complete, complete dump was in my drawers.  Complete?  Like a, like a, like a mound.  What kind of underwear were you wearing?  Just like, just like boxed.  You don't have to show us.  Jesus.  Like underwears.  Well, I wanted to get a visual, but.  Who wears bright orange and red underpants?  Hipsters.  Hipsters do? 
[02:56:00]  Hipsters.  Hipsters.  It's not like, it's not that I don't like them, by the way.  It's that I wouldn't even think to go, oh, I need to get bright orange and red underpants.  I just get the regular shit.  Well, because when you have, you don't know where you're going to be and you have to drop  trowel.  And you get, it's like, oh, you got nice underwear on.  Most people do know.  Most people do know.  Most people know exactly where they're dropping trowel.  Drop trowel.  You don't know what kind of situation you'll be in, you know?  I'm not, I'm, I'm just saying.  Yeah.  I don't have time to start figuring out, you know, what bright color underpants looks 
[02:56:30]  good on me.  They're just Uniqlo.  They're just like a, like a generic.  Now, uh.  Generic?  Generic or white?  See, white, that's, that's taking risks right there.  Ah, oh, okay.  Especially when you shit yourself.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  White pants, uh, white underpants are perfect because then you know you got the racing stripes  officially and then you can either wash that shit out by hand in the fucking sink or throw  them out.  Well, you don't want to be washing in the sink.  But if you have black underpants, you never know when you got the racing stripes. 
[02:57:00]  Well, that's true.  I'm talking about the, the pesky ones that don't come out in the, the regular wash situation.  You just throw those out.  That's what I'm saying.  Well, you got to remember also with white, uh, underwear, the front also can get a little,  uh, weird.  Right.  Because if you pay attention to the rule, milk, milk, lemonade, round the back, fudge is made.  Right.  You will know that it also gets in the front, hence, lemonade.  Yeah.  Stick your finger in the hole.  Out comes the tipsy roll. 
[02:57:30]  I remember that too.  I, uh, press the button, pull the chain.  Out comes the chocolate choo-choo train.  A good one.  Oh, he helped you.  Yeah.  Uh, she got robbed.  Completely.  I'm sorry.  Sometimes we just do shit for ourselves.  Anyway, um, um, oh, oh, really quickly.  Like when my kids shit themselves.  Yeah. 
[02:58:00]  Like these kids will shit all the way up their back and fuck up their, their onesies and  their pajama pants and their fucking t-shirts.  I'm the guy that takes that shit right into the, into the bathroom.  And I washed that shit out right in the sink.  You washed it right out in the sink.  Like, oh, I just got queasy.  Yeah.  But the other option is to throw it in with the regular laundry and then my fine fucking  clothes have some fucking puke or shit residue on it.  Two words.  Garbage chute.  No, I washed that shit out by hand.  I get the palm of my hand going like I'm down by the river. 
[02:58:30]  That's what it fucking rocks.  Because otherwise you'd have to put the shit pants in the same washing machine as your  piss socks.  That's right.  You don't want that to happen.  I found a booger on my sock the other day.  Boo!  How'd you find it?  I meant to tweet that.  You know what?  I'll tweet it today and make it believe it happened today.  Don't do that.  It's gross.  I was sitting around really bored.  It was the same day.  I was, the same day I was wondering if my cleaning lady was going to show up with those  weird text messages I got.  And I remember, and I didn't tweet this, that I found a booger on my sock. 
[02:59:00]  But whose booger is it, you think?  I'm all queasy.  It's disgusting.  I don't fling my boogers anymore, so I don't think it was mine.  Oh, gosh.  Might be the cleaning lady's booger.  Ew.  Fire her.  No.  No, I will not do that.  Troy, back to you.  So what kind of shit was this?  Was it intact?  Or really mushy?  It's just, I think I have a parasite.  Because I got back from Mexico last week, and I've had diarrhea all last week.  Oh, boy.  Dude, I know a guy who, he did. 
[02:59:30]  He had one of those amoebas or one of those fucking things living in him.  But I think it's great, because I was, like, losing weight.  It's great, but you've got to get some antibiotics.  What happens if you just let it go?  I don't know.  I don't think antibiotics take care of a parasite.  Well.  Not like that.  Not some fucking worm that, if you magnify it, it looks like a fucking got, like, big hooks  on it.  Yeah, yeah.  And they hook into your intestine, and they got a big sucker mouth, and it goes, it just 
[03:00:00]  sucks your nutrition out of you.  It's just getting bigger and bigger in your colon.  Wait, you've been losing weight since Mexico?  Yeah.  For real?  Yeah.  How much?  I don't know.  I just thought it was, like, water weight.  I was really sick over the weekend, too.  I thought I had strep throat.  You have L-AIDS.  Oh.  Felt like it.  For sure.  Something Spanish.  Cleaning lady Spanish.  Oh, so you definitely have something if you're shitting yourself for the first time.  Oh, man.  You ever see the monsters inside you or something like that?  No, no.  I know it.  I don't need to see that.  It's a show about fucking, like, parasites. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  It's crazy.  Some guys fucking tiptoeing through the tulips there.  They're in Holland or something.  And fucking steps on a rock and cuts his foot.  Before you know it, he's got, like, fucking, like, dragons living inside him.  It's crazy.  Microscopic dragons.  Yes.  My question is, those microscopic dragons, do they have shit living on their bodies?  I don't know.  How far does that go before finally there's no shit living on anyone's bodies?  I don't know.  You know what I'm trying to say? 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  Because if we put a microscope to our own flesh right now, we'd see all sorts of shit going on.  I guess a paramecium or an amoeba.  Yeah.  Or something like that.  Or is it infinite that way as well?  We know it's infinite this way.  We know it goes infinite this way where everything gets bigger and bigger and fucking expands and stuff.  Well, I don't think anything could be as small as a one-celled creature.  How do you know?  So once you get to that point.  Do we know for sure?  We also thought there was, what, eight?  I was going to say eight.  How many planets did we used to have?  Well...  I always get that number wrong.  We had nine. 
[03:01:30]  We did, right?  Now we got eight.  We have eight now.  Because Pluto's...  What about all that other shit?  Aren't we saying those are planets too?  Well, there's other planets in other solar systems.  We grew up at a time where they thought there was nine planets in the whole universe.  Whoa!  Remember those days?  I don't think I remember that.  That was a long time ago.  No, they didn't acknowledge that there might be other planets.  Yes.  Well...  Didn't Troy shit the bed?  No.  It wasn't...  Luckily, it wasn't in the bed.  It was just...  It stayed contained inside my... 
[03:02:00]  Did you roll over on it?  Was it flat?  I was laying there.  I just...  It's like a potato waski.  It just felt...  Something felt...  Something felt moist back there.  Yeah, huh?  It just felt like...  I was like, oh, man, I should probably go wipe back there.  I don't know what's going on.  Oh, man.  And then when I lowered my underwear, I was like, there's a dump.  You thought you just needed to wipe a little?  Well, I was kind of out of it.  I was really tired.  Oh, wow.  And then I had to take off my underwear and then wash them out in the sink.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Were you in bed with your girlfriend? 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  Holy shit!  Did it smell?  No, it didn't smell.  It had to smell.  I mean, if I would have put my nose up to it, it probably would have smelled.  But luckily, it didn't smell up the room.  And we have an air purifier, so that probably helped.  Did she notice?  No, she's knocked the fuck out.  She still doesn't know.  No, she was texting me.  She's like, you feeling okay?  I'm like, I didn't say anything.  Oh, maybe she said you're feeling okay because she knew.  Maybe.  But I don't think she did.  I think I pulled this one.  I pulled the wall of the rise on this one.  And you didn't just throw your fucking underwear out?  You washed them? 
[03:03:00]  Well...  What did you do with that?  Walk me through this.  You wake up.  There's shit in your pants.  I want a fucking minute.  A second by second.  You take the underwear, and then you drop the load off into the toilet.  What did you do?  You kind of go like this, and you push the load on its way, and it drops into the toilet.  Like you're telling something to scurry off?  Yeah, just a little like...  Skedaddle.  A slight scurry, like you'd kind of take it and just bloop.  Get gravity going, and then that thing rolls out of the underpants into the toilet bowl.  And then what you do, then you take the remains of the underpants, and you wash it out in the sink. 
[03:03:30]  Using the palms of your hand to get it all good and nice again.  Well, that would be the case if it was solid.  And then...  Oh, no!  Oh, then you just hose it down with the fucking sink.  And then you throw it into the regular laundry.  It didn't leak out of your leg holes?  No.  Luckily, I don't know how it was positioned.  It just kind of stayed contained?  And then I just washed it out in the sink, and then I had to let it dry for a couple of hours.  And I'm the first one to get out.  So, like, solid chunks of shit were falling in your sink and going down the drain? 
[03:04:00]  No, it's like...  There was no crust to it?  No, it's liquid, man.  And there's like...  Oh, my God.  It just seems like there's, like, fibers.  Oh, my God.  You know what I mean?  Those are worms.  Yeah, nothing is staying solid in me.  The fibers are probably worms.  Oh, my God.  That's very unhealthy.  I don't...  It's not good.  Did you drag your ass on the carpet like a chihuahua?  Was it itchy?  Oh, my God.  The little worms?  Yeah, so then it just washed out, and I let them dry out for a little bit.  And then I had a position of... 
[03:04:30]  They're in my closet right now.  They're still drying.  But I washed them out real good.  And then that way, because I don't want to throw them in the laundry basket until they're completely dry.  Your girlfriend wouldn't have opened your closet?  No, she doesn't go in my shirt.  Wait, why can't you throw it in the laundry before they're completely dry?  Because if it's still wet...  You don't want her to know that you were washing your underpants out in the sink.  Well, yeah, I wouldn't leave them out like that.  Because you would wonder why my underwear are just sitting there like that.  It gets all mildew-y if you fucking put wet laundry under other laundry and just kind of sits there.  And you never know.  There could be a little shit residue on there that you didn't notice until it dries out. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah, I'd just rather it just be completely dry.  Yeah.  I mean, that way it's just, like, flaky.  It'll just flake off.  Damn.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was bad.  That's the best I was talking about.  Yeah.  Oof.  So, yeah, there's something seriously going wrong in my guts.  Are you going to go to the doctor?  I'm debating whether I should or not.  I should just kind of ride it out.  You'll die of dehydration.  Dr. Fun.  I'm staying hydrated.  Dr. Fun.  You're not.  You're going to go right through you.  I'm going to call Dr. Steve, see what's up.  People are saying there's something alive in you.  You want Dr. Steve on the line? 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  He can help you through this.  There could be a parasite.  Were you drinking water?  Parasitic.  Yeah, I've been drinking water, Gatorade.  In Mexico.  I had ice.  That was stupid.  But see, the drinks that they give you, you need them.  They're all ice.  See, one goes, din, din, din, din, din, din, din, din.  And his goes, din, din, din, din, din, din, din, din.  But didn't he buy the other version now, too?  Something.  He's brilliant.  That was bullshit.  He said that, yeah.  As the interview was passed, I believe he was lying to us when he said that.  I think he was. 
[03:06:00]  He probably bought the rights to use it for that song.  Yeah.  Like he paid to use it for that song.  I'm the person.  Din, din, din, din, din, din, din, din, din, din.  Like all the money the song made, he probably paid in rights.  Right.  Yeah.  He was lying when he said he bought the song.  Old fucking Rip Van Winkle.  I don't remember his name is.  He was cool as shit.  At this time?  Yeah, he was.  Don't bring up shit right now.  I loved Vanilla Ice on our show.  He was great.  I had some Vanilla Ice Cream. 
[03:06:30]  Yes, you did.  Great.  And Troy had some shit.  Oh, that's Troy.  Come on.  I had one, too.  It's going to fuck me up.  I know.  That's a bad idea.  Are you lactose intolerant?  No, but I just, I'm worried about it.  I'm ethnic intolerant.  Very intolerant.  He's got a parasite living in his body, though.  Yeah, I got them using my tax money, so mine's a little more painful.  Oh.  Yeah, I figuratively shit the bed.  You think Pamela Brown and Chris Cuomo are just fucking the shit out of each other's?  Oh, man.  Each other in between live shots? 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  That would be a nice, you know.  I'd be a senior watcher to understand that one.  She's a good-looking fucking blonde piece of ass, and the way Chris Cuomo is looking at her,  I'm thinking they might be doing some of that fucking in between live shots.  You've got to think these recorders do that.  If the guy's got any game, he goes up to the girl, looks around at the devastation,  goes, you know, this could just happen any time, man, right?  Right.  Isn't it a life-weird thing like that?  Like, you know, you're here one day, the next day you're gone.  You might as well just live for the moment and suck my dick.  Dr. Steve. 
[03:07:30]  Ah.  Hey, Dr. Steve, you deal with death a lot, right?  Yeah.  Are you a toucher?  Do you mean inappropriate toucher?  No, man.  And, like, open casket, do you give a little touch?  No, no, no, no.  Exactly.  Thank you.  Just a little touch.  I hope he likes fucking, I hope he goes square dancing with the corpse.  It's a curiosity thing.  Like, I know I'm saying goodbye to my dear old friend here, but curiosity's getting the 
[03:08:00]  best of me, and I'm thinking, well, what does the skin feel like right now?  Well, that's okay.  You can do that.  Dun-ba-da-dum-ba-da-dum-bum.  Dun-ba-da-dum-bum.  Dun-ba-da-dum-da-dum-bum-bum.  And Troy Kwan apparently shit his panties in bed.  Last night.  Last night.  And it was watery.  And he said he's been...  A mushy load.  It was mushy.  A lot of flood.  He had his pants in bed?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You shit in your sleep.  In my sleep, yeah. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, yeah.  What's that about, Dr. Steve?  I have been terrified of that, because there's times when I'm asleep and I'm dreaming.  Oh, yeah.  I know that I have to...  And I'm taking a shit in my dream, and I'm terrified.  Laying some nice rope.  I'm taking a shit in my sleep, and I can't run fast.  Oh, then I fly.  Why are you terrified of that?  If it happens, it happens.  Who cares?  Terrifying.  As long as you open up your eyes in the morning, who gives a fuck what's in the bed? 
[03:09:00]  Amen.  Oh, please.  I disagree.  Wake up like fucking Waltz in The Godfather.  Big load of shit in your bed.  All right.  I've always been terrified of that, but it's never actually happened.  So it's...  Yeah.  Well, Dr. Steve...  It's very unusual to shit your bed.  This phone call isn't about you, sir.  We're trying to help out Troy Kwan.  Okay.  Sorry, buddy.  Troy, what are the odds he has a parasite? 
[03:09:30]  Because ever since he came back from Mexico, he's losing weight, and you're having runny shit in general there, Troy?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  He had some ice in there in Mexico.  Some ice.  Ice, baby.  Most of those places...  Hold on, man.  We're digging on the ice ice baby for a second.  Oh, my goodness.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  I know, right?  All right.  Turn it down.  Sorry.  All right.  Just don't mention ice again.  All right. 
[03:10:00]  And then we'll be forced to do this.  So what happened?  Most...  Hey, Troy, were you at a resort?  Yes.  Okay.  Most of those places will ultra-filtrate the ice that they use, so that's not...  Wait, what'd you say?  I told you not to say ice.  Damn it.  All right.  El hielo, en espanol, but the...  So they will ultra-filtrate those things.  It's most of the time the fresh fruits and vegetables that you're eating at the resort that's going to give you the turista. 
[03:10:30]  Ah, the turista.  If you come home with diarrhea for a couple of days and it resolves, then it was probably a bacterial or viral turista.  But if it persists more than about five days, it most often is a parasite.  Oh, my God.  Oh, fuck.  How long has it been, Troy Kwan?  I got back last Monday.  Oh.  Oh, geez. 
[03:11:00]  That would be a week.  What kind of parasites are there, Dr. Steve?  And describe what they do.  You ghoul.  A more than single-celled creature that can live in your GI tract and multiply and eat the food that you eat and eat your shit.  And it gives you inflammation of the intestine, which causes the loose stool stuff.  Loose stool. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  Why is it called a stool, Dr. Steve?  Well, because there's a very interesting, not really, story behind that.  But when the kings had privies back in the Middle Ages, when they learned to actually shit, you know, in a different room from everybody else,  they would have a stool, and they would say, oh, the king is at stool, and because they would sit.  Because everybody else was squatting and just shitting on the ground. 
[03:12:00]  Uh-huh.  Or something.  Right.  So he would actually sit on a stool.  And they would say, oh, the regent is at stool, and that would mean that he's, you know, sitting in the dumps.  But these assholes couldn't figure out that maybe they should be sitting, too?  Why not at the...  They're just shitting all over the place as the king figured out how to shit properly?  And why wouldn't they say at the stool, or on the stool?  Why just at stool?  Oh, I don't know.  Why do they say they go at hospital instead of at the hospital? 
[03:12:30]  I hate that whole thing.  I think I have to go to hospital.  Oh, oh, I'm going on holiday.  Right, exactly.  And then prom.  Oh, we're going to go...  Are you going to prom?  You're not.  It's the prom.  Am I not going to the prom?  Oh, you might be going.  I'm not going to the prom.  They'll never let me in.  I'm sorry to hear that.  Maybe I could crash it.  I told you.  Make believe you're like the band.  Just join the band for the night or something. 
[03:13:00]  I could do that.  If there is a band.  I think they're going to be playing some of those fucking songs we heard earlier.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What song was that again?  We're at the prom, nigga.  Here we are dancing at the prom.  We're at the prom, nigga.  Here we are.  There's a two-chain going on.  Yeah, motherfucking two-chain.  Two-chain.  That was Drake, Dr. Steve.  You dork.  Oh, hey.  Dr. Dork. 
[03:13:30]  We love our dork.  What can he do about these parasites?  Oh, good question, Andy.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Hey, is it true?  First of all, let me ask you a question about another parasite.  Those tapeworms.  A lot of rumors about tapeworms.  If you put a bowl of milk next to your mouth, will they crawl out of your mouth?  No.  All right.  No, they're in your small intestine, so they can't.  Now, there are other worms that can crawl out of your mouth.  Is Sam in front of the...  The one-eyed wonder worm.  The one-eyed wonder worm.  Have Sam look up the roundworm Ascaris, A-S-C-A-R-I-S, and then Google image that shit. 
[03:14:00]  Could you smell that again?  A-S-C-R-I-S.  Oh, he needs that.  A-S-C-A-R-I-S.  Ascaris.  And these fucking things, the roundworms...  Put brown in front of it.  ...can live in your lungs and stuff, and then crawl out your nose at night.  Ah!  Ah!  I don't ever want that. 
[03:14:30]  That's in Troy's body.  No, it's not.  Get it.  No, it's not.  I'm going to have spaghetti today for lunch.  I'm going to have a big, giant bolus of them.  Oh, my God.  Go down.  Look at the big cluster of it.  Oh, they look like lomaine.  That's inside you.  No, it's not, dude.  You got that inside your tree?  That's not a parasite.  It's in your ass.  Oh, fuck.  It's going to crawl out your penis hole.  You got that in your body?  You're on the worm worm in your asshole.  Ew.  You're going to have shit crawling out of that pee hole.  Ah.  Oh, worms are going to crawl out of your pee hole, dude. 
[03:15:00]  Hey, Dr. Steve, is that true?  People go swimming in these polluted or nasty infected lakes, and they take a piss, and when  the piss stream is coming out, they swim up it, and...  No.  Yes.  No?  Yes.  All right.  No.  Yes.  I'm just going through all those parasite rumors.  Why not do that shit?  Why can't a parasite?  Yeah, they swim upstream.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Are you talking about if you're in the water and pissing?  Yeah, yeah.  You're in the water.  You're taking a piss.  Can they get in there?  There's that little fish that does that, the kundiru fish. 
[03:15:30]  The kundiru.  Let's look up the kundiru.  Oh, man.  And it swims up your piss hole?  Yep.  And then what the problem is, you know how fish are?  They're smooth if you rub them one way.  Right.  If you rub them the other way, well...  Oh, yeah.  That's why you never shove a fish up your ass tail first.  Right.  A little word of wisdom.  Did you piss in a lake?  No.  Oh, my God.  You got one of these fishes up your pee hole.  You got a fish in your dick.  I piss in the ocean.  Oh, no. 
[03:16:00]  That's where they live.  I just piss in the ocean.  That's where they live.  No, they live in lakes.  No, you got one of these things up your pee hole.  You got a fish in your dick.  Oh, God.  You live in the Amazon.  What is it about piss holes that they like so much?  Especially Troy's.  It could be the temperature gradient, or they may actually be following a chemical gradient  of urea for whatever reason that they're attracted to that, and they'll just swim  right up your cock.  Urea heap.  Remember them?  This was Urea heaping. 
[03:16:30]  It used to be felt that this was a mess.  You see lemon?  Yeah.  But in fact, the river monsters guy proved that it was actually true.  Troy, do you have a warm piss hole?  I do.  Oh, you know what that means.  Fish like it in there.  Dr. Steve, what happens if I just ignore it and just go with the weight loss and enjoy it?  Yeah.  Your body might be able to clear it over time because people live in these areas and they 
[03:17:00]  survive.  But it would be a real impediment to your lifestyle over time, especially, like, I'm assuming you  like girls.  Girls don't like guys who shit in the bed.  Oh, that's true.  So, you know, you might want to take care of it.  So, you might leak out your legs next time.  Oh, gosh.  And what they would do is they would, you would shit in a cup and they would look at it under  the microscope, a thing called a stool for ova and parasites.  And when they discover which parasite it is, then they would give you a medication designed 
[03:17:30]  to kill just that parasite.  Wow.  And then you'd be done.  Now, could it still just be a bacteria?  Yes.  It's only been a week.  So, I'm saying, you know, if it goes longer than five to seven days, then that's when  you start.  Yeah, but he's shitting himself at the tail end of what this is supposed to be.  No pun intended.  It's the eighth day.  Right.  It's the eighth day.  And on the eighth day, Troy shit his pants.  And he said it was good. 
[03:18:00]  Dr. Steve, what is it if I have flaggle or sippico?  Flaggle rock.  Sippico.  E-rock?  Comment?  Flaggle?  Flaggle will, yeah, flaggle.  Flaggle.  Flaggle.  Well, that's where you have a box marked flaggle and you don't shake it up too much.  Now, that's so stupid.  It really is.  That will sell a single parasite I call trichomonas.  Oh.  Trichomonas is a vaginal parasite.  And it will also...  We might have that.  Ha ha, Troy's got that. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah, how's your vag?  He's got that on his face, right?  The vag is okay.  You've had a lot of sand in it lately.  Oh!  Oh, shit.  Punch him in the face, please.  Oh, damn.  What is that parasite and how do girls get that?  Oh, that's a horrendous parasite.  It makes a yellowish, frothy custard discharge from the vagina.  Ah!  Ah!  It's like a monster.  Go ahead and Google image that one.  That's a good one. 
[03:19:00]  Dr. Steve has the best Google image suggestions.  Flaggle?  No, flaggle is the drug.  It's metronidazole.  It's an antibiotic and it kills anaerobic bacteria.  But what's the thing we're looking for?  Yeah.  It's trichomonas.  T-R-I-C-H-O-M-O-N-A-S.  Trichomonas.  Yeah, just look for the discharge.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh!  Dude! 
[03:19:30]  What is it?  It looks like a watered-down McDonald's vanilla shake.  Exactly.  It's on a vagina.  It's bubbling, too!  Oh, it's horrendous.  Wow.  I don't think you should ever...  Under the microscope, it'll scare you because you're not expecting to see a fucking monster  under the microscope.  This is horrendous looking.  Do you see monsters under the microscope?  Yeah.  That's gotta be cool as shit.  With the legs and they're jerking around and stuff, it's really kind of crazy.  Holy shit. 
[03:20:00]  Tiny monsters inside Troy.  Oh, my God.  Are you coming up soon?  I'm hoping to come up in June sometime.  So why don't you bring your microscope?  I want to check out monsters under a microscope.  That is so fucking sick.  I can do that.  I have a microscope.  Bring it up.  You know what that looked like?  It looked like Fidel Castro was doing the part of Mia Wallace ODing in the...  When she was vomiting up her $5 shake.  Troy, is your ass down for whatever? 
[03:20:30]  Is it ass down?  Apparently.  What do you mean?  Well, I wonder if it falls into the category of down for whatever, that you're shitting  the bed.  If it means that there's going to be a penis going into it, no.  It's not down for whatever.  If Dr. Steve wants to examine something in my asshole...  Dr. Steve, you haven't shoved your fingers in anything in a while.  No, it has been a while.  No.  No.  Troy's never had that treat, so...  We could scoop some fecal matter out of his asshole and look at it under the microscope. 
[03:21:00]  Can we really?  Yeah, we can.  All right, Troy, you can't take care of this issue until Dr. Steve comes up.  Yeah, until Dr. Steve comes up.  I'm just saying, theoretically, we could do that.  He needs to take care of it.  Well, you want Troy...  He could mail you some of his feces.  He could smear it on a little index card and mail it.  I could send him my underwear.  Or, yeah, you want to...  You should send Dr. Steve your underwear.  I'll drop off Troy's underwear at the lab.  They'll appreciate that.  Just take a dump directly in a box and just write Dr. Steve's address on it. 
[03:21:30]  It might get complicated.  Just send him a box of shit.  Yeah.  It's got to be a bag.  Would you get in trouble with the post office if it...  Oh, my God.  How would they know?  If it was addressed to a doctor...  And it's just leaking through the bottom line.  Yeah, you don't do it proper.  Like, not leaking, but the cardboard's a different color.  A little more oily.  Like when you leave the pizza box out all night.  Is there anything dangerous in his box?  Is there any...  No, it's just some shit.  Yeah, it's good.  It's just...  Yeah, it's just some shit. 
[03:22:00]  Wow.  Dr. Steve, I've been asked to ask you about...  Coccidia?  Oh, boy.  You might have that.  What is...  What is Coccidia?  Coccidia?  Yeah.  C-O-C-C-I-D-I-A.  I don't know.  It doesn't sound good.  Images for Coccidia.  It's very microbial.  Microbial. 
[03:22:30]  It looks like a single cell.  Could be Coccidia or something.  I don't know.  Oh.  Coccidia?  Mainly in dogs.  No, I don't.  Oh, it's in dogs?  Yeah.  Oh.  Only dogs get it.  Lynn, what's wrong with you?  Yeah, I don't know.  All right.  I don't know what Coccidia is.  Sorry.  There's no monster living in Troy's penis.  Yeah, you got something in your penis.  It's obvious, Troy.  Something up your ass.  Something in your penis, which leads me to believe something's going on.  Yeah. 
[03:23:00]  But you look great.  You lost a few pounds.  Lost some weight.  A little lighter, right?  But Parasite does some people wonders.  That's what I'm saying.  You know?  Iraq.  Oh.  No, you know what?  Maybe we should get him a ticket to Mexico.  Oh, my God.  Just have him swim in the nude.  Have him swim in the nude and wait for nature to take its course.  A fucking Mexican lake.  Go ahead.  Take a leak, buddy.  And he's just chugging tap water.  Go down there and enjoy yourself. 
[03:23:30]  I thought we were going to the beach.  No, I just found this lake off the side of the road.  The image of a nudie rock.  Back stroking.  Some dirty, dirty fucking pond in Mexico.  Dude, drinking water.  Drinking tap water.  Hoping to get a parasite.  He's in the middle of the lake, spitting the water out through his mouth.  Yeah.  Like a fountain.  Just doing the backstroke.  Sorry, Iraq.  Yeah.  And we have a lot of material today, too.  So we didn't really need to do that.  Yeah, we didn't have to go there.  It's fun, though.  It was fun.  Always is.  Should be a song written about it. 
[03:24:00]  All right.  There's a story that women used to take tapeworm eggs and actually ingest them.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  As a weight loss.  To lose weight.  What?  Before the days of Fensan and stuff, they would actually ingest a parasite.  And then when they lost the weight that they wanted to, they would take the medicine to kill it.  I actually look forward to the flu every season.  I am?  Yeah, it's great for weight loss.  Yeah, it's good for about seven pounds.  You get about five to seven pounds off your body. 
[03:24:30]  Nice.  Yeah, that's a nice week of fucking feeling like death.  And then all of a sudden, you overcompensate the other way and fucking gain the weight right back.  Why can't you keep the flu weight off?  It's like, hey, I lost some weight.  I could afford to eat this ice cream sandwich.  Breakfast.  For breakfast.  Breakfast of champions.  Our schedule is so weird.  It's like, this is lunch, really.  If you think about it.  Just justify it.  All right, Dr. Steve, the podcast, not doing as well as our podcast. 
[03:25:00]  Oh, my God.  But doing very well in your little world.  Rubbing it in.  Everybody's doing as well as your podcast.  You guys are still number one.  Dr. Steve's podcast is a parasite of our podcast.  It's amazing.  Oh, dude.  Dude, I was at Tony D's in Rochester.  I'm going real local.  Tony Dan's is.  And I sat next to his lovely couple, me and Weez did.  And a doctor up there, huge fan of your show.  Huge fan of us, but also a huge fan of you as well.  And I forgot his name. 
[03:25:30]  And he wants to do your show.  He's like an ass doctor up there or something.  Yeah.  The ass man.  Oh, I'd love to have him do it.  He's like an ass slash colon slash whatever doctor.  I'm the ass man.  Yeah.  I'm an ass man.  Dan, Dan.  Ah, this guy's a huge fan.  I'm an ass man.  Dan, Dan.  Oh, yeah.  This is with the parents I was singing when he was nuzzling his way up Troy Kwan's bunghole.  I love to shove him.  Yeah.  I love to kick him. 
[03:26:00]  I love to shove him.  I love to stick him.  Yeah, right up his ass.  I love to shove him.  I love to watch him.  I love to pick him.  My favorite part coming around now.  And I'm gonna kick him.  Why?  Because I'm an ass man.  You sure are.  Yeah.  I'm an ass man.  There comes a great rock voice.  Great words.  Great tune.  Oh, I'm an ass man.  I would rather listen to the Teddy Doors song.  Jim Johnston. 
[03:26:30]  And who was he?  Jim Johnston.  He does all the wrestling songs.  Oh.  Wow, that's the same guy that does them all?  Wait, they hired one guy to do all the wrestling songs?  Is he still working with them?  What do you think?  I'm gonna pay a whole fleet?  He's ridiculous.  He's really good.  Has he sang anything else but wrestling intro songs?  What's the other big one he did that everyone knows?  And you know Vince McMahon has him chained in a fucking basement somewhere.  We'll let him go.  You think you're doing your own music?  You've got another thing, cop.  That's him? 
[03:27:00]  What?  Where?  E-Rock, same guy?  No, he...  No, this is not the same locals.  He didn't get the chorus for this one?  No.  Oh.  E-Rock.  The two wrestling guys are going at it right now.  Oh, man.  E-Rock can say it.  Oh, my God.  Sam just got E-Rock with a good one.  He did...  This is a...  He did a theme for The Undertaker.  You can hear it's the same guy.  You're gonna pay.  I can't allow you to think you could just walk away.  That sounds like...  Yeah, but why, uh... 
[03:27:30]  And face the piper you're gonna pay.  Cause the end is now.  This is gonna be your dream.  Yeah.  A cheap shot.  It sounds like a song.  I was blindsided.  But things will never, ever be the same.  Nice guys.  Instead, they always finish like what's bad asses. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah.  I can't think about it.  It sounds like another song.  It sounds like a song.  Well, that's not a popular one.  I don't know that one.  I'm talking like big-time mainstream, like The Ass Man.  Wrestling guys know all these songs.  Yeah, he did.  I don't know quite.  If you ever take a trip down the car, I'm kind of doing it, yeah.  Big Boss Man's thing.  Does the Boss Man still use this song?  Yeah, does he?  Does he still use this song?  Does he?  Does he?  We need to know.  When he comes out, it must be exciting.  He doesn't come out anymore. 
[03:28:30]  Oh, you're tired?  What's he doing?  He's passed away.  Oh, no.  I'm almost positive I've told you guys that before.  Oh, no.  How old was he, though?  Almost positive.  He was in his late 40s.  Oh.  That's like old age for wrestlers.  Yeah.  That's terrible.  At least he lived a full life.  I believe Jim.  In the wrestling world, he lived a full life.  That is a full life.  If he made it to the late 40s.  I believe this was a Jim Johnston classic.  Yeah.  Well, it's the big show. 
[03:29:00]  Yes, it's a big, bad show tonight.  Big, bad show tonight.  It's the big show.  It's the biggest show tonight.  This is terrible.  It's the big show.  It's the big show.  Nothing compares to Ass Man.  He should be a rapper with these lyrics.  Yeah.  Is he doing any new ones, though?  I mean, the big show is new.  That's still a newer song?  I see he still uses it.  Thank God we got rid of Dr. Steve, by the way.  Hey, Dr. Steve.  Oh.  He's still there.  Awkward.  What's your day look like?  What's your day look like, Dr. Steve? 
[03:29:30]  You got to come out to any family members and say, you know, I'm so sorry?  Anything like that?  That pretty much sums up my day.  Do you ever have to tell family members anything?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All the time.  Do you have to tell them, like, ah, they passed.  Ah, they're dead.  Sure.  You do?  Is that how you say it?  They're passed.  Ah, they're dead.  Oh, my God.  How do you tell people that?  Well, hopefully you have a relationship with them before you tell them.  Oh, that's true.  They have been a burden for many years before you have to say that. 
[03:30:00]  They have a relationship with the family, and so when they go, you know, you just show  empathy and you respond to their emotions, and, you know, there's a whole thing on how  to break bad news and how to deal with it afterward.  Oh.  One of the things you always do when you're breaking bad news is you tell them what you're  going to do.  You don't just go, well, you're going to die and then walk out of the room.  Jesus.  Well, you're going to die, but this is what we're going to do. 
[03:30:30]  Unless you're Cancer Peggy from those Cancer commercials.  No kidding.  And he told me that I'm not going to make it for fucking three more months.  What about the one with the window?  Not tonight.  Not tonight.  What's the name of the broad?  Not tonight, Mildred.  Not tonight.  Well, it's some kind of tradition when a person dies, you've got to fucking open the window  so they open the window.  So I shut the window and said, not tonight.  All dramatic.  Like, yeah, sure.  Yeah, but tomorrow, yes.  I like that. 
[03:31:00]  Cancer Peggy, though, is the best.  Yeah.  She's like sitting there and she starts talking.  She goes, and the doctor just came in like he was handing out fucking, you know, and told  me that.  And then I went to the cancer treatment center and they told me there's no expiration date  stamped on your foot.  And then it's like, no, it's on your fucking liver, apparently.  Dr. Steve, remember I told you about that guy in Rochester?  Yes.  Well, Dr. Needy's on line, too. 
[03:31:30]  Steve, what's up?  Hey, Opie, how are you?  Dr. Needy.  Dude, I listened to you for like seven and a half minutes on my way into this hospital  this morning, and of course, I landed perfectly when you mentioned me in Korean.  It was great.  Yeah, you guys are great.  Thanks, buddy.  I really appreciate you spending the time with us.  It was awesome.  I didn't really have a choice.  You were sitting two feet from me.  He's a real doctor?  He's not like Dr. Funt.  He's a real doctor.  Wait, we got two Dr. Steves on the line. 
[03:32:00]  Maybe you could be the new Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve.  Yeah.  I am going in to drain some peri-rectal fluid.  Oh, my peri-rectal fluid.  They love fluids.  Doctors just love their fluids.  What kind of fluid is that?  I guess that's the bad kind of fluid.  That's not a good one, I'll tell you.  What?  That must stink really bad.  Dude, it clears the room.  No.  What is it exactly?  That's a good one.  Look, the Dr. Steve is like, oh, I've got to make sure I talk during the segment. 
[03:32:30]  I don't want to be replaced by the other Dr. Steve.  What is it made out of, and how does it cause, and how do you fix it?  Well, it's all the bacteria that's found in your GI tract, and it just overgrows in places  that it really shouldn't belong, and it just causes an abscess.  Yes, it's really...  Oh, my God.  So it's a shitty abscess in your...  By your...  Where is it located?  Right in the buttock.  Is it right on your...  Manchin and puss mixed together. 
[03:33:00]  Oh, my God.  Fermented.  And then fermented for about a week before he lances it.  And then you have to lance it.  Lance!  Can we bring some of that shit into the studio?  Cool.  Can we put some of that in, like, a little jar?  Make a mustache out of it.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Dr. Steve, can you bring that up with your microscope?  Yeah.  I'm serious.  Bring up some samples.  I don't think I would want to even get near that shit. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah.  I don't know if you can transport biologicals like that, because it's actually...  It's almost to be weaponized.  Yeah.  Wow.  Weaponized ass pus.  Oh, my God.  Can you imagine?

We were taking a peek.  Jesus.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh.  Totally.  You'll be surprised.  Natural.  Oh, really?  Natural.  I hope he thought there were bags of fluid in there.  No, no.  They look...  Trust me.  They look great.  Yeah.  I didn't know they were natural.  How they feel.

You don't know this one?  Not really.  Yeah, I remember this one.  It's just a slow version of...  It's kind of a cool song, actually.  Doing a lot of music today.  More than usual.  We turned people on this song today. 
[03:51:30]  And the Drake song.  Yeah.  The brand new Drake song.  It's not brand new.  It's brand new, Sam.  It's been hot for a long time.  It's actually on the way down.  No, it's brand new.  It's very close to brand new.  We were the show that brought you Gangnam Style.  Don't forget that.  Gangnam, first of all.  Gangnam Style.  There's no D in it.  Gangnam Style.  What's Gypsy sound like?  Now I need to know.  You got Gypsy too there?  I'm looking.  Hang on. 
[03:52:00]  Are we really doing a Uriah Heep break?  Holy shit.  And we didn't run out of material, I swear to you.  No.  I don't even...  Honestly, I don't think I've ever heard of Uriah Heep.  Yeah.  You'd have to be like an old school rock guy.  We don't have Gypsy.  The classic rock guys out there know fucking easy living.  Guarantee that.  How the fuck does Sirius XM Satellite Radio, with their vast catalog of music, not have  like every song?  Right.  I'm so surprised when it's like, no, we don't have that one.  It's like, what?  It's easy.  Just load it into the system. 
[03:52:30]  Man.  I looked in both systems, and it's not in there.  Supposedly the singer for Uriah Heep.  We have another situation on our hands.  Who's the other guy we already forgot?  The guy with the FedEx store or the fucking UPS store?  He's the UPS.  One of the UPS guys.  We already forgot him.  Was he from Cinderella or something?  No.  Cinderella was the plumbing store.  The guy went over to help him with his fucking pipes or something.  Yeah.  Who's the other guy?  We forgot already.  Yeah, we did.  Whatever.  Jeff in Delaware. 
[03:53:00]  Jeff.  Hey.  The singer, Ken Hensley.  I met him about 10 years ago backstage at a show in Phoenix.  He's a representative from Marshall Amplifiers.  Oh.  Well, that's just as good as playing to a sold-out arena.  That was many years ago, so.  Yeah, I understand.  Yeah.  At least he's doing something.  All right.  I'm fucking Uriah Heep.  Forget it.  I know you're not a big...  I've never heard of this one. 
[03:53:30]  You've never heard of this one?  I swear.  Wow, really?  Most stations don't play it, I guess, but...  You hear about Sergio Garcia, Anthony?  I know you're not a big golf guy, but...  Doesn't he do the engineering here for Sirius XM?  It's Mars.  Oh.  It all sounds the same to me.  That's Mars.  Oh, okay.  Sergio has a little beef with Mr. Woods.  What happened?  Tiger Woods.  Oh.  I don't know where... 
[03:54:00]  Maybe Travis knows.  I don't even know where that started, but...  Sergio's not a big Tiger Woods fan.  I would assume a lot of the guys aren't big Tiger Woods fans.  No.  On the tour.  He's getting a lot...  He's gotten a lot of attention for a lot of years.  That's got to put some jealousy in those guys' heads.  They loved seeing his little fall from grace there.  Right.  Bon Jovi's called Justin Bieber an asshole?  Sort of.  What do you mean?  Well, he said that type of...  I'm waiting for another story, but I just saw that one.  It's like, if you behave like that, you're an asshole. 
[03:54:30]  Right.  I don't think he directly said, Justin Bieber's an asshole.  But he said his behavior is that of somebody who would easily be called an asshole.  Gotcha.  Oh, but they're trying to spin it?  If they act like that.  Yeah, a little bit.  When I read that, I'm like, you know, with how close I am with Jon Bon Jovi, I wouldn't  assume he would do something like that.  No, it just didn't seem like Bon Jovi.  Well, Bon Jovi, he's fan-friendly.  So what he's getting at is when Bieber fucked over his fans over there in England, was  it?  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:55:00]  He didn't show up.  He showed up late.  All that shit.  All that stuff.  Bon Jovi wouldn't do that.  He's really talking about the acceptance speech, too.  Oh, he is?  Oh, he is.  He talked about that, too?  Well, that's where the quote is coming from.  He's talking about, you know, saying, Justin Bieber's saying he wanted to be taken seriously  and that he's an artist.  Oh.  And so Bon Jovi said every generation had guys that do that.  None of that is new.  They run the risk of disrespecting their audience members who have worked hard to pay for their  ticket to give you the permission to take two or three hours of their lives, or in that 
[03:55:30]  kid's case, 80 minutes of their lives.  Do it once.  You can be forgiven.  Do it enough times and shame on you.  They won't have you back.  Is he saying that Justin Bieber doesn't play very long, either?  Yeah, you just slammed him by saying 80 minutes.  It's like two or three hours of the time.  Oh, unless, you know, it's Justin, 80 minutes.  He says, it's really not cool.  You're an asshole.  Go to fucking work.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:56:00]  How's Sambora doing?  Oh.  You know that Bon Jovi...  He said the same thing about John.  Yeah.  Bon Jovi kicked Sambora out of the band and no one even noticed.  Yeah.  He's touring without Sambora, unless they brought him back.  Really?  Yeah.  Who does the...  Wanted!  Who does that?  Dead or alive!  You need the wanted guy.  It's some, like, tech.  Ah, just the drum tech.  The drum tech comes out.  He's mic'd.  Dead or alive!  He's just backstage. 
[03:56:30]  He's hanging out.  Yeah, well, last night was a pisser.  We fucking...  Holy shit.  The bitches...  Okay, and then the bus got a flat tire.  So, hold on, hold on.  Wanted!  Dead or alive!  I don't know.  The beers are supposed to be around here.  I walk these streets!  Yeah.  Okay, cool.  Is Sambora back?  I don't even know.  I'll go see Bon Jovi, but...  Yeah.  ...not about to drive too far.  I've never seen him. 
[03:57:00]  And I don't feel it.  I wouldn't get, like, stuck in traffic or anything.  Bugum, bugum, bugum, bugum, bugum.  Wow, very good.  So, anyway, Sergio Garcia has a beef with Tiger Woods.  And he kind of said something that...  I thought...  It's just funny, but they have to spin everything.  Yeah.  Make it just race, race, racist, racist, racist, racist.  Oh, is it race?  Basically, he said, we will have him round every night. 
[03:57:30]  We will serve fried chicken.  Because someone asked him if he would have Moe for dinner or something like that.  Oh, boy.  So he had to quickly apologize.  You know what that means.  You can't mention black people, or even half black people, and fried chicken in the same sentence, or it's racist.  But you ask any black person if they like fried chicken.  They love it.  Oh, my God, they do.  Love it.  So why is that bad in the end?  For real.  I don't get it.  I don't know. 
[03:58:00]  People are very sensitive about stereotypes.  Some groups, a lot more than others, are very sensitive.  But stereotypes are all true.  Yeah.  They're based in fact.  They're based in fact in general.  When you generalize, it's true in most cases.  I'm certain there are quite a number of black people that despise fried chicken.  But...  The majority.  For the most part.  Right.  Yeah.  Oh.  And I'm sure there's a black guy with a tiny penis out there.  Oh, I don't think that's true. 
[03:58:30]  Oh, no.  All just giant fucking anaconda cock.  Giant lake monsters.  Yes.  Big lake monsters searching for Troy Kwan's asshole.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And sliding right up.  Yeah.  Up the old pee hole.  Poor Troy.  Doesn't know if he's got bugs up his ass.  He does.  Troy Kwan's chick laying next to, like, fucking parasite, man.  Parasitic duty, man.  And now those parasites are on the sheets.  Yes.  Looking for another host. 
[03:59:00]  Crawling around.  Looking for a new host.  A host.  I hate that.  It's looking for a host.  Hello, parasites.  I'll be your host for this evening.  Right.  What will you have?  And they had to have had sex since they've been back.  Oh, man.  Do you think there was any butt play?  Possibly.  He leaves with the fingers.  He's down for, like, everything, right?  Whatever.  Down for whatever.  So, butt play is probably in the mix. 
[03:59:30]  If her finger, she pulls it out and it just, like...  Oh, and there's a little bug under her fingernail.  Oh, my God.  The parasite can spread, like...  Remember when fucking...  When Neo touched the mirror and it fucking grabbed his finger and got covered?  That's what that parasite's like.  You put it up Troy Kwan's ass and his asshole just fucking swallows up your whole body.  Troy's ass parasite just consumes all that it comes into contact with?  Yes.  It's a black hole.  Oof.  Yeah. 
[04:00:00]  So, Garcia, just quickly.  He was at some kind of awards dinner.  Jerry?  Jerry Garcia.  Oh.  He was there.  The European tour players did this little dinner.  And he had to officially apologize.  Garcia says.  And I like his apology because it's more real than the fake ones we get.  Yeah.  The bullshit ones where it's so generic.  He writes,  I apologize for any offense that may have been caused by my comment on stage during the European  tour players' awards dinner.  But I was in Europe and didn't think I would get back here to the U.S. 
[04:00:30]  where people are very oversensitive.  And then I realized there is that thing called the internet.  Yes.  I answered a question that was clearly made towards me as a joke with a silly remark.  But in no way was the comment meant in a racist manner.  So someone was asking him a dumb question.  Yeah.  Like, would you have them for dinner?  And obviously they don't get along.  So why would he?  And then he goes, yeah, well, I'll get some fried chicken.  Right, exactly.  He should have followed up with, yeah, and I'll have a Perkins waitress bring it to him  at my table.  Ah, see, because he fucked that Perkins waitress. 
[04:01:00]  It's not the first time fried chicken has been brought up, by the way, as far as Tiger Woods goes.  No, I do recall.  Garcia's comments Tuesday were reminiscent of one time when Fuzzy Zeller took Kiefer after  Woods won the Masters for the first time back in 97.  This is written very poorly.  Basically, okay, so Woods wins the tournament back in 97.  And the Masters winner is allowed to choose the champion's dinner menu for the following  year.  It's a little tradition they got. 
[04:01:30]  And Fuzzy Zeller said, you pat him on the back and say congratulations and enjoy it and  tell him not to serve fried chicken next year.  Got it?  Or collard greens or whatever the hell they serve.  Oh, he really went to town.  Or watermelon or illegal guns.  Whatever the hell they serve.  Fucking Fuzzy, losing his mind.  Fuzzy Zeller later apologized.  But he actually added, got it?  Got it?  Do you get it? 
[04:02:00]  He's a black guy.  Oh my God.  Get it?  I think it's all fine in the end, but whatever.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  A lot of sensitive, a lot of people make believe they're fucking sensitive.  Very sensitive.  Fry that chicken.  Fry that chicken.  I got a pan.  Fry that chicken.  Finger lickin'.  You hear me?  My chicken.  Southern fried chicken.  Finger lickin'.  You hear me?  You hear me?  My chicken.  Southern fried chicken. 
[04:02:30]  Finger lickin'.  You hear me?  Anybody wanna piece of my chicken.  I got me a plan.  I'm gonna get a pan.  Yeah.  I'm gonna fry this chicken in my hand.  I got some hot grease and a whole chip.  It's Peaches.  Don't wash your hands, but you're gonna be lickin' them.  Big ol' thing of fried spice.  Oh, I never heard the long version.  Oh, yeah.  I only hear the hook, usually.  The extended version.  That's what she does live.  A piece of my chicken.  Peaches got some chicken.  I don't want any of Peaches cheekin'. 
[04:03:00]  No?  It's my chicken.  Chicken.  Chicken.  It's no drag, but it's catchy.  Oh.  With her fuckin' five-inch-long fingernails.  Ech.  Fingernail.  All right, why don't we get out of here, fuck it.  All right.  I think we did everything.  I mean, the Anthony Wiener thing, we can play that tomorrow, right?  Oh, yeah.  Still hot.  Still a hot topic.  That's the Jodi Arias shit. 
[04:03:30]  Yeah.  She has decided, I guess, she doesn't want to die.  She's not as cocky as she was, huh?  No.  They were saying she was just going to go out in a blaze of glory, basically saying, fuck  you, kill me, I don't care.  But now it's obvious that she does care.  You know who's really cocky?  Troy Kwan when he sleeps.  Cocky in his pants.  Ah, cocky.  He made cocky.  Cocky.  Oh, boy.  You think he makes wet in the bed, too? 
[04:04:00]  He has, I'm sure.  He makes wet?  Yeah, he makes wet.  He made doo-doo in his pants.  He made doo-doo.  Cocky.  He made cocky doo-doo.  Cock-a-doo-doo in his pants.  Cock-a-doo.  Cock-a-doo-doo.  He made poo-poo.  Uh, poo-poo?  It came out of his coulee hole into his underpants.  His coulee had doo-doo come out and it went into his undie pants.  He's a baby, baby, stick-a-head and gravy. 
[04:04:30]  He needs a big diaper.  He does.  His doo-doo.  Doo-doo diaper.  He's a poopy.  He's a poopy doo-doo diaper boy.  Fucking hilarious.  Nailed him.  Yeah.  All right.  Uh, well, I guess we're through here.  Yeah, fuck it.  All right.  We've hit our intellectual quota for the day.  We certainly did.  If you want more Opie and Anthony, uh, this week's podcast is now officially available. 
[04:05:00]  Episode two.  Every Wednesday, the Opie and Anthony podcast comes out.  A little over, uh, an hour of material.  Uh, this week we got two old bits and one new one.  Uh, the old bits.  Tippi Tom discuss, discusses, uh, Sophie's Choice.  And watches.  And watches it and breaks down and cries as he breaks down the movie a little bit.  And then you got, uh, Roland trying to say Bonaduce.  And every time he said it wrong, we fucking put his fingers in an electric mousetrap. 
[04:05:30]  Bonaduce.  Right?  Bonaduce.  Did you ever do the, um, the, uh, something old, something new, something bar, something  blue, uh, set on the radio?  No.  Where you go an old song.  Right.  Then a new song.  Then you do a cover.  And then you play some blues.  Nice.  Some old, some new, some bar, some blue.  Coming up at 11 o'clock.  Who's doing that?  I don't know.  I remember hearing it years ago on some shitty fucking music station.  Nice.  Yeah.  I'll have to do that tomorrow.  Oh, yeah.  And, uh, also don't forget the Opie and Anthony Nugget ends every podcast. 
[04:06:00]  And this week it's the George Brett shit story.  I think it's a solid podcast this week, Sam Roberts.  It is.  It's actually better than the first week, believe it or not.  No.  Oh, we have Trace Atkins, because that interview was terrific.  We cut, uh, we cut a 40-minute interview into a 20-minute segment.  So it moves right along.  It moves, uh, we, we chopped out some of that fat.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, stop.  Trimmed that fat.  You know, he's working hard today and stuff.  Eric, I didn't, I didn't mean that.  I, I, I said don't do it.  Which means do it. 
[04:06:30]  No, it means that it didn't even, wasn't even being mentioned.  It means your show's over.  Goodbye.  The Opie and Anthony show is pretty much over.

And, Troy, you said yourself, if you're not in Cleveland to party, you shouldn't be in Cleveland.  Ha, ha. 
[04:14:30]  And when the party is brewing down in Cleveland, you know what's poppin' off.  If you're sitting here naked with your dick out, you're cool, all right?  Yeah, whatever.  All right, cool.  We on vacation, baby.  And boys will be boys.  Sam, go ahead and stick your finger in my butthole.  But all foreplay, all the time, makes Jack a dull boy.  Feel me?  Slow that shit down for a second.  I'm 34 years old, man.  I know how to pace myself.  Dude, you're fuckin' awesome at this. 
[04:15:00]  You're doing really well.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck yeah, bro.  Smash that ass.  Throwin' down in Cleveland.  The only way we know how. 
[04:15:30]  Dude, you should teach a fuckin' class.  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  Serious sex ass.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Sorry about that.  After Opie and Anthony Live, secret meetings were going on in here that we're not privy to.  But I'm assuming, as with all meetings, whatever Opie and Anthony are complaining about not getting done tomorrow will be what today's meeting was about. 
[04:16:00]  So I'm not too worried about it.  We'll all find out what was going on in here.  Bosses were in here.  Let's go to 908 and start the after show with you.  All right, we're not going to start the after show with 908.  And say, yeah, it's too late, buddy.  We're going to area code 270.

Nah, I don't need your advice.  All right.  We'll talk later, though.  210.  You're on the air.  No?  Okay.  Anywho.  Yeah, I'm sure Jim will do his advice show probably tomorrow.  He's not here today.  So, what are you going to do?  I'll spend the call.  All right.  I'll see if...  210, can you hear me now? 
[04:17:00]  Yes.  I was level 29, sweetie.  Oh, lady trucker.  Don't talk to me about Candy Crush anymore.  I got all kinds of tweets about it.  Yes, I have not gotten past level 29.

I haven't given up yet.  Obviously, I'm going to keep going, but...  You might want to take line one.  Okay.  Hello, line one?  Yes, hi. 
[04:17:30]  Lady Di, how's everything?  Oh, my gosh.  Lady Di, as I live and breathe.  How are you?  Okay, pretty good.  This is a...  I just wanted to let you know that me and Marion...  Yeah.  Who is this, first of all?  My name is Sam Roberts.  I'm the host of After Open Anthony Live.  Sam Roberts.  Okay.  Yes.  Sam Roberts.  I've got to write that down.  Please do.  Because I have no idea who you are.  Well, I'm a professional broadcaster, so not to worry.  You're in good hands.  Very good.  I just wanted to let you know that we met Ron Jeremy yesterday. 
[04:18:00]  You did?  Well, I'm glad that you're calling.  Now, Lady Di, it's been years since you've been on the Open Anthony show.  Many years.  How long has it been?  Oh, my God.  Ever since 2001 or 2002 or something like that.  Right.  And why now would you call and announce to the world that you met Ron Jeremy?  Well, because...  Well, there's two reasons.  Because I miss those guys.  Okay?  Yeah.  And I don't have the XM satellite radio, so I can't even listen to them. 
[04:18:30]  The one that has the XM satellite is Marion.  Not you, Lady Di.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  I don't have it yet.  No.  I don't have it yet.  What are you waiting for?  I don't know what I'm waiting for.  I have no idea.  Now, Lady Di and Marion, you two are, of course, we actually talked about you a few days ago.  You were the ones that showed up to the MTV Video Music Awards and interviewed people many years ago.  Yeah.  Was that fun?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[04:19:00]  No, actually, it wasn't the MTV Music Video Awards.  No.  I believe it was the VMAs.  Right.  Okay, okay.  I was wrong.  It was not the MTV Video Music Awards.  It was instead the VMAs.  The VMA Awards.  Right.  Very similar to the MTV Awards.  Right, right, right.  It was, that's something totally different.  So what's going on, Marion, I mean, Lady Di, in your life right now?  Oh, nothing much.  I still live in Elizabeth.  You do?  I mean, I've been here for a long time.  Now, which one was homeless? 
[04:19:30]  Was it you or Marion?  Me.  That was me.  That was you.  Are you homeless to this day?  No, I'm not homeless anymore.  Well, congratulations on that.  You got yourself a house?  No, I don't have a house.  Wow.  A little apartment or something?  An apartment, yeah.  That's good.  Something modest to remind you of your roots.  Yeah, yeah.  No, no, no.  It's just a nice, really comfortable apartment, and I live with my roommate.  Are you, your roommate, is this a romantic roommate? 
[04:20:00]  No.  Any men in your life?  No, except for my son.  Oh, wow.  And so at some point, there was a man in your life.  My son is 22 years old.  Your son is 22.  Now, wasn't there some issues between you and your son at one point?  Yeah, but that was a long time ago.  Well, it's been a long time since we spoke.  Yeah, I know.  That was a while ago.  That was a while ago.  There's no more issues in my life right now about that.  So what are you doing with your life, Lady Di?  Um, nothing much, really. 
[04:20:30]  Just watching TV and hanging out.  Watching television and hanging out.  Do you have a job, or?  Not right now.  Why not?  I'm in between jobs.  Oh, I see.  Just getting the resume out there?  Uh, resume?  Right.  Nah, nah.  Nah, you don't.  Not yet, anyway.  Nah, still working on the resume, then.  That's the phase we're in right now?  Yeah, no.  Marrying had the same job for so many years.  Right, well, yeah, but that doesn't do much for you, does it? 
[04:21:00]  No, she's still a best friend of mine.  Right, yeah, but still, I mean, if your best friend has a job, it doesn't make your life  any easier.  No, no, no, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Are you still drinking?  You still having, you still knocking back a few drinks?  What are you getting so personal for?  No, just trying to find out what's going on in your life.  It's all stuff that's been discussed on the air.  You know, hanging out, watching TV.  What's your favorite TV show to watch?  Uh, my favorite one?  Your favorite one?  The Monkees. 
[04:21:30]  You watch The Monkees, okay.  What?  You watch The Monkees, is that...  What are they laughing at?  No, I wasn't laughing.  I just, it was a strange response.  Yeah, are you still drinking every now and then?  Yeah, once in a while.  Once in a great while.  Who's to say, right?  Yeah, no, just beer.  So what do you do...  Not hard stuff or anything.  Just beer.  Just beer.  What do you do for an income?  Well, right now...  Yeah. 
[04:22:00]  For the income...  The income, the money, the beer money, as it were.  I really don't want to mention this.  Go ahead.  All right.  For the income right now, I'm living off of my dad's money.  Oh, did your dad pass away?  Yes, he did.  I'm sorry to hear that.  Uh, wait, don't...  Please don't tell ONA that.  I won't.  It's between you...  It's between you and I, Lady Di.  It's...  This is an intimate conversation.  Right, right.  So that's the only income I have right now. 
[04:22:30]  Okay.  And how long is that going to last you?  And, uh, my roommate's money, too.  My roommate, you know.  You're leeching off your roommate?  Huh?  You're leeching off your roommate?  I'm leeching off my roommate.  All right.  Well, if that's what you're doing, that's what you're doing.  No, I'm not.  Well, I'm asking you.  You just said you were.  No, I'm not doing that to him.  Hmm.  How...  Well, then...  I mean, how are you living off of his money?  He pays the rent here.  Oh, I see.  How'd you get that deal? 
[04:23:00]  I met him a long time ago.  About maybe about...  I don't know.  How many years, Bill, do we know each other?  Is she banging him?  About eight years ago.  So is that the thing?  As long as you, uh...  As long as you're a liberal with the blowjobs, free rent?  Excuse me?  No, I'm asking.  It's a question.  That's not meant to be offensive.  No.  Oh.  We don't do stuff like that.  No, no, no.  It's just free rent and television and beer. 
[04:23:30]  Yeah, for now, anyway.  For now.  Please do me a favor.  Do not tell Owen Avis because it's going to be all over the air.  Yeah, no, no.  I mean, you're on the air.  You called the show.  No.  I'm on the air right now?  Yes, it's after Opie and Anthony Live.  I told you that.  We told you.  E-Rock told you that before you came on.  Oh, my...  He screamed...  I'm on the air right now.  E-Rock screamed the call, and he said, Sam's doing the show, and then I picked you up.  Oh, my goodness.  It's all right.  It's just talking and catching up with old friends. 
[04:24:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I'm told now.  The weird thing...  Don't even worry about it, Lady Di.  I mean, we're just catching up, figuring out what's going on in your life.  And actually, I got a text from Anthony, of all people.  Anthony from Opie and Anthony, who writes,  Ha, ha, ha.  Her dad's money.  She's a fucking bum.  Oh, no.  Get out of here.  No, that's what he said.  Yeah, on the text message.  He's probably just joking, though.  I don't see an LOL, but I think he's just kidding.  Oh, my goodness. 
[04:24:30]  He saw ha, ha, ha.  Right.  He wrote ha, ha, ha.  He's just joking around.  We're all just catching up and having a good time.  So why don't you get out there in the workforce?  I will.  I will pretty soon.  What do you...  What do you...  What's your skill set?  Huh?  The what?  Your skill set.  My skills right now?  Yeah.  Where are you going to start a...  My cash register.  Cash register.  You're going to look for a nice brick-and-mortar store that needs some drunk lady to cashier. 
[04:25:00]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I just figured that I will be a cash register person at a liquor store.  Tell me that one, so this way he can text you back.  Okay.  Well, he's probably listening.  Cash register person.  At least you know the lingo and everything.  Why is it taking you so long to get a cash register person job?  I don't understand.  Uh, no problem.  No problem.  I have no idea because every store that I go to, everything that I go to, they either  have the computers, you have to sit there for 45 minutes, you know, to fill out applications 
[04:25:30]  and stuff like that.  You don't have that kind of time?  Why?  Is the monkeys on?  They're on on the weekends.  Oh, oh, so during the week, couldn't you take...  You could even tell Anthony that one, too.  Right, okay, well, good.  I mean, he'll really get a kick out of that.  And if you're listening, the monkeys are on on the weekend.  Now, the question is...  And during the week is the Partridge family.  Of course it is.  The question is, if you have time to watch shows that are literally 30 and 40 years old, 
[04:26:00]  do you not have 45 minutes out of your day to fill out a job application?  Yeah, I do.  I do.  It's just something you haven't gotten around to yet.  How long has it been since your last job?  About maybe about four years ago right now.  Four years.  Okay.  And you just...  You've kind of been just, what, dusting up the resume since then?  Early retirement.  Let's just put it that way.  Early retirement.  Well, her last job was working at ShopRider, King Cullen. 
[04:26:30]  Did you work...  Where did you work?  King Cullen?  No, that's not me.  That wasn't you?  You were getting bad groceries?  My last cash register job was at Dunkin' Donuts.  Oh, well, that was a silly thing for you to say, Eric.  No.  No, you don't think so?  No.  At one point, she got fired from a supermarket.  Did you get fired from a supermarket, Lady Di?  Lady Di.  Maybe you did.  I was let go from a supermarket after two weeks of working.  ShopRite. 
[04:27:00]  Right, ShopRite.  Yeah, see, that was silly, Eric.  King Cullen, that's insane for you to make those accusations.  I said it was one of the two.  I don't even know where that is.  Yeah, I mean, that's crazy.  Eric is nuts to say you got fired from a King Cullen.  So when you got fired from the ShopRite, why, why after two weeks did they let you go?  It was a credit card thing that I did and...  Try to steal some money?  Make any difference.  No, I didn't steal any money.  So what was the credit card thing?  She was stealing the carbon papers.  Were you stealing carbon papers?  No, I was not stealing carbon papers.  I know, it's a ridiculous... 
[04:27:30]  Say, Eric, come on.  Why, uh...  Oh, it was something dumb.  What was it?  It was only up to two weeks of working there.  And I don't like the job anyway.  But anyway, that's besides the point.  Well, yeah, I mean, nobody likes the job.  Like, a great job would be to sit at home, drink beer, and watch the Monkees.  But the thing is, it's not a productive way to be a member of society.  You know.  Listen, I didn't call up to tell you what my resume says.  Did you ever see that movie, Pursuit of Happiness, with Will Smith and Will Smith Jr.? 
[04:28:00]  No, The Pursuit of Happiness?  You should see it, Lady Di.  It would really inspire you.  Because this is a guy who was homeless like you.  I don't know if he was, like, you know, blowing dudes and all that stuff.  But he was definitely homeless.  Some of your habits might have been different.  But Will Smith was also homeless.  And he ends up, he gets off his ass, he gets a job, and then he's not...  No, no, no, I remember what movie you're talking about.  Right, right.  Like, you just seem to have mastered the middle part.  You know, the kind of, the bummy part. 
[04:28:30]  Oh, my God, I wish I had XM Satellite.  Well, yeah, I mean, you, I know...  I wish I could just...  She's got her dad's money, she could get one.  That's one of those things, though.  Like, you wish you had Sirius XM Satellite Radio, sure.  But one way you could do that is if you would, you know, stop watching The Partridge Family  and just go be a cashier person.  You could use that money for, for a radio.  No?  That's true.  Have you ever seen the movie American Psycho?  No.  You remind me of the character Al that he meets in the alleyway. 
[04:29:00]  I never saw that movie before.  Why don't you get a fucking job, Al?  You know?  Look, there's no need for foul language.  You're right.  But it is an XL channel, and you may not realize that without the subscription.  I know, I already know that.  Did you know Opie and Anthony are podcasting?  Yes.  You did not know that.  You're lying to me.  How would you have figured that out?  How long did you know that they were podcasting for?  Podcasting?  That's exactly right.  Yes.  Wait a minute, hold on. 
[04:29:30]  I said broadcasting.  Oh, oh, of course.  The slip of the tongue on my part.  Podcasting.  Podcasting?  What's that?  I know, it's one of those newfangled things.  Don't even worry about it, Lady Di.  Nothing to do with the cash register.  So, you don't have to blow this guy that you live with for the free rent, huh?  No.  How does he let you live there for free, then?  He likes me a lot.  When was the last time you were sexually active?  During the monkeys. 
[04:30:00]  When was the last time you were sexually active?  Do I really have to...  Do I really have to answer that question?  I mean, it's just a nice thing.  We're playing catch-up.  Around four years ago.  Four years ago.  And what was the circumstance around that?  Oh, nothing.  No, it was something.  I mean, it was a sexual activity.  No, no, no, nothing, nothing, nothing.  It's nothing.  Don't worry.  Don't even worry about it.  Was it during the time where you were without home?  No.  Was there sexual activity while you were homeless? 
[04:30:30]  Maybe a little?  I believe there was.  A little bit?  Lady Di, we're all friends here.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on a second.  Sure.  Yeah, we're all friends here.  Right.  You and the other guy and about 10,000 other people that are listening to this show.  Nobody listens.  Nobody listens to this show.  You're grossly overestimating my popularity.  Yeah, I was a little bit back then, yes.  A little, it's passing out blowies a little bit. 
[04:31:00]  Whatever.  Whatever it is, whatever the kids are calling it, how often would you say, while you were  homeless, were you blowing other homeless guys?  I don't know.  What are you talking about?  I'm asking.  No.  You know, while you were homeless.  I mean, because if you were homeless, to blow a homeless guy is just like, well, I'm  homeless too.  It's not like it's that big of a deal.  No.  No?  There was no homeless people in my life when I was homeless.  You were blowing guys with homes?  Yeah.  Whatever.  Oh, I see.  Maybe, you know, trying to get yourself out of a situation, you know, use that mouth, 
[04:31:30]  right?  Oh, no, I did not.  That's ridiculous.  I know.  It's offensive that I even bring it up.  So tell me about four years ago.  What about four years ago?  What happened?  You met a man?  Well, yeah.  And, uh, and, and, and walk me through it.  Nothing much more to say.  Well, no, because you said, I mean, meeting a man is not, well, I'm not worried about it  not working out after.  I'm worried about the sexual activity. 
[04:32:00]  I'm trying to, uh, titillate our audience right now.  It's none of anybody's business.  How old a lady are you, if you don't mind me asking?  I'm 51 years old.  51 years old.  51 years young, according to me.  So you're 47, um, you meet a man, 49, 50, 51, yeah.  47 years old.  You meet a man.  This is, uh, uh, you're, you're recently with home.  You were just went through a period where you were homeless.  And what happens?  Are you, uh, do you go all the way?  Home run? 
[04:32:30]  Sexual intercourse?  You know what?  I don't remember.  Okay.  I think you'd remember if it, I mean, you, you'd have to remember which orifice was penetrated.  E-Rock.  Oh, will you stop already?  E-Rock.  None of anybody's business.  When you're with a woman, you know, and you don't mind me asking you something intimate,  do you?  Depends.  When you're with a woman, you're going to remember which orifice you penetrate, correct?  I would hope so.  I would think so.  I think I would.  So which orifice was it that, that was penetrated on you, Lady Di? 
[04:33:00]  Oh, you guys are funny.  I can't believe, you come on after Opie and Anthony?  That's right.  This is the after show.  We just kind of, uh, we tie up all the loose ends.  Okay.  You know?  Well, I just, I, the only reason I called you is to let you know that me and Marion went  over to meet Ron Jeremy.  Okay.  And, and is that no sexual activity there?  Huh?  No sexual activity there?  No.  How was that?  Where did, where'd you meet Ron Jeremy?  At a liquor store. 
[04:33:30]  At, of course.  You were probably there anyway, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Just getting all, getting all fucked up.  Um, so.  I was not fucked up.  Well, you were on your way, though.  Why else would you go to a liquor store?  Am I right?  I went there to meet Ron Jeremy.  He's doing a signing at a liquor store?  Yes.  He's doing a signing at a lick her store.  You get what I'm saying?  Yeah, a lick her store.  Okay.  You get it, right?  I got you.  Lick her box.  You know what I mean?  Anyway, so what happened? 
[04:34:00]  Do you meet Ron Jeremy?  Does he, uh, what does he call you?  Piece of ass?  What does he say about Marion?  Um, he, he really didn't say anything much about anybody.  He just, uh, was there to promote his rum liquor.  The rum.  Rum liquor.  I just got, I just got the funniest text from, you know, Anthony Cumia from Opie and Anthony.  Wait till you hear this.  Because, because Anthony is no, of course, known Lady Di forever.  She was, she's been with the show.  She used to do the WNEW show forever. 
[04:34:30]  Oh, yeah.  And you were on Sirius XM a few times with, uh, with the show.  Ant just texted me.  He's been listening in the car.  In the past ten minutes, all the feelings of wanting to choke this cunt face have come back.  Oh, come on.  Isn't that, isn't that funny?  Not to me it isn't.  So, how is it, how, you and Marion are still hanging out then?  I'm still hanging out with him.  Well, I mean, I could see where he would, where he would feel that way.  You and Marion are still hanging out with each other then?  Yeah.  Have you ever been in, like, a threesome situation with her? 
[04:35:00]  Oh, no, no, no.  No, that's, that's ridiculous.  Nah.  Isn't Marion a little fed up with your bullshit, though?  What bullshit?  Well, she's got a job.  Obviously, she's trying to better herself, and you're just sitting there drinking and watching reruns all day and being like, yeah, I'll get there someday.  Luckily, my dad's dead, so I got all this cash.  You know, you know, I may benefit from watching reruns one of these days.  I doubt that.  Why?  What would possibly benefit you from watching reruns? 
[04:35:30]  I don't know.  I don't know.  I mean, I have no idea.  I just love watching reruns these days right now.  How long ago did your dad pass?  Oh, he's been, uh, he's been gone since September.  Since September?  And how much, how much, how much of that cash do you have left?  Well, um, I have no idea.  I don't think I should tell anybody that.  Do you think he's looking down from heaven right now, proud that his daughter is spending his life savings on beer so she can sit at home and watch the monkeys? 
[04:36:00]  He's not proud, he's not proud of me.  He watched you blow those homeless guys.  He wasn't even dead.  He was, he, he was, but he was watching.  No.  The truth comes out, Lady Di.  Can I ask you a question?  Are you right right now on the, on the radio?  That's exactly right.  We're on the Opie and Anthony channel, XM 103, Sirius 206.  You knew that, though.  Are you going to repeat later on?  Huh?  Are you going to repeat later on?  Yeah, there'll be a repeat. 
[04:36:30]  It's on, uh, right after the O&A replay.  This show will be on three times today.  Really?  Yeah.  Okay, I'm sure Marion's going to hear this.  Does she listen?  Does she have Sirius XM?  Huh?  What?  Does Marion have Sirius XM?  She does.  She has XM satellites.  Well, that's the same, Sirius XM.  That's the company now.  Oh boy.  Oh boy, I know.  It's a little crazy, huh?  I never thought.  I just wanted to leave you a message to tell you that we met Ron Jeremy.  Well, here's the question that I'm wondering. 
[04:37:00]  What?  Why the fuck would Opie and Anthony care at all that you met Ron Jeremy?  Oh no, I just figured I'd let you guys know.  Right.  Yeah, no.  I'm sure.  There would be a message.  I'm sure that they don't, they wouldn't care at all.  You know.  Okay.  Because what's the thing?  Because there's no story behind it.  You know, if you'd let him rail you or whatever, then that would be a story.  I did ask him, wait, I asked Ron Jeremy if he was married, and he said no.  That is a terrible, terrible story. 
[04:37:30]  That is a horrible celebrity interaction.  If you want to find out, I did ask him.  No, that's not, of course he's not married.  He fucks all the time.  It's a terrible interaction.  It's just, it was a bad question.  You had one question for Ron Jeremy.  That is a terrible question to ask him, and it's a terrible story to repeat.  It's not interesting.  You're mad at me now.  I'm not mad, but I just want you to know that that is not, not an interesting story.  Wait until we come up to the studio. 
[04:38:00]  When are you coming up to the studio?  If you are coming up to the studio, you've got to make sure you have better anecdotes than that,  because that was horrible.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, no, it's okay, but it was horrible.  All right, I'm so sorry about that.  I don't seem to be horrible.  Don't even worry about it.  It's not funny.  It was terrible.  No, no, no, all right.  Well, I did ask him, and he said no.  Now, stop repeating it.  It's a terrible story.  Are you drunk?  No. 
[04:38:30]  Maybe a little buzzed.  Maybe a little...  Well, they should think I'm drunk at 20 to 11 in the morning.  No, because you're an alcoholic.  Okay, I'm an alcoholic.  Okay, well, that's good.  I mean, you're there.  Now we just got to get you off of it.  Okay, all right.  I think Partridge's family's starting.  She's got to go.  Yeah, is Partridge's family...  Partridge's family doesn't start until 4 o'clock this afternoon.  Oh, wow.  So you've got a lot of time to not apply for jobs, then.  Oh, my goodness me.  Yeah, I know.  It's crazy, huh? 
[04:39:00]  Yeah, it's nuts.  All right.  I just got a really interesting text.  Can I read it to you?  What?  Go ahead.  Okay, it's actually from Anthony Cumia from the Opie and Anthony show.  What's the matter with him?  What's wrong with him?  No, he's just listening to the show.  He enjoys the after show and some of the guests I have on.  And he's just...  He writes in to me via text.  This segment reminds me of why her husband threw himself in front of a train.  That was not my husband, first of all.  Are you sure?  Because Anthony says it was your husband, and he threw himself in front of a train. 
[04:39:30]  Hold on.  First of all, that was not my husband.  Who was it?  He was a friend of mine that I used to live with, and we had a son together.  My son right now is 22 years old.  Oh, I see.  That's your baby's daddy.  And what?  He gave himself the old heave-ho off a platform, huh?  Yeah, well, he wasn't with me back then.  Right.  I mean, it had to be. 
[04:40:00]  Do you take responsibility for that?  No.  I would imagine it was mostly...  No, I don't.  Really, I don't.  He wasn't with me back then.  I would imagine a lot of it was probably your fault.  It was not my fault.  Don't you think he was thinking back and being like,  Oh, my God, the shit I have to deal with from this woman.  No, no, no.  She's talking about Ron Jeremy and just these horribly boring stories.  What is the matter with you, Mr. Sam? 
[04:40:30]  I'm just telling you that.  Roberts is my last name.  That thing was not my...  Roberts, Mr. Roberts.  That's right.  That part was not my fault.  Okay.  We were broken up already two or three years.  I see.  And still...  And he...  Even with a two or three year buffer, it wasn't enough.  He said, I cannot be on this planet as long as that woman is walking around.  No, he did not say that.  And then you ended up blowing some homeless guys.  You think he was watching from heaven, flat as a pancake, looking down from the clouds 
[04:41:00]  at the mother of his child blowing homeless guys to try to find a couch to sleep on?  Why?  I can't wait.  Just wait.  Why?  Because I would like to tell you off in person.  There's no reason for you to tell me off.  You called and we've been catching up.  Yeah, I know that.  But the only reason I called was to leave a message to say that I was...  But do you understand that Opie and Anthony couldn't give two shits about what porn stars 
[04:41:30]  you're talking to?  I mean, you didn't even have a good story.  If you had blown Ron Jeremy or taken it in the ass from him, then Opie and Anthony would  be like, wow, that's really interesting.  But not this.  Not to just say, oh yeah, I was in the liquor store again without a job and I met Ron Jeremy.  Oh my gosh.  You know?  Yeah.  You know.  Yeah, I know.  Hey, I actually just got another text.  Do you watch the David Letterman show, Late Night with David Letterman? 
[04:42:00]  What about it?  You've heard of the show.  Yeah.  The head writer and executive producer Justin Stangle just texted me.  This is true.  Do you want to hear what he said?  He's listening to the show.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Sure.  Did you tell me the other texts were not true?  No, no, no.  All these texts are true.  Okay, go ahead.  But I have to tell you, he has a question for you.  Justin Stangle wants to know, were you watching the monkeys when the father of your son killed 
[04:42:30]  himself?  When he jumped in front of a train, was there a monkeys episode on that you were watching?  No.  No.  No, there wasn't.  And who texted you that?  That was Justin Stangle from the David Letterman show.  He was just curious.  Some of the holes.  I feel like I wasn't filling in all the holes for everybody.  Wait, hold on.  Yeah.  Let me write that down.  Wow.  Do you hear what song that's playing right now?  Yeah, I saw it. 
[04:43:00]  I know.  I hear it.  What song is it?  I'm not as familiar with the monkeys.  It's the last train of Clarksville.  What's the connection here?  He jumped in front of the last train of Clarksville?  What's the connection here with you that this song might be playing?  How's Marion doing anyway?  Are you guys still social?  Yeah.  You guys are still social together?  It was yesterday.  Isn't she disappointed in you, though?  Oh, kind of, yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, she's just watching you just kind of completely waste your life. 
[04:43:30]  How come you don't stop by the studio more often?  Um, we will.  Don't worry about it.  Just so I can go over there and kick your ass.  Were you waiting online for an iPhone by any chance?  What?  No, I'm just asking.  It's just a question that made no sense.  There's no reason for you to want to kick my ass.  I'm sitting here giving you advice.  That's what Wednesdays are for, giving advice.  Yeah, I know, I know.  Get a job.  Get a job.  Why don't you get a fucking job, Lady Di?  You know?  I will.  I will.  I don't believe that. 
[04:44:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, you don't believe it.  Okay.  Why did you get fired from the supermarket?  Something about a credit card.  No, I remember that.  I forgot about it.  I don't think you forgot about it.  What did you do with the credit card?  I didn't do anything with the credit card.  Well, then why would they?  The customer did.  Why were you fired?  Because the customer had a credit card.  Because I sent the customer over to customer service.  And I could be honest about this one.  Yeah, thanks.  This is what happened.  Thanks.  She paid port cash, port credit card. 
[04:44:30]  And I took the cash, I put it in my till, everything like that.  And I told her to go over to customer service and pay the rest of it.  Instead, she walked out with a lot of groceries.  So I got fired after that.  Oh, that's good.  Do you have this phone number, Iraq?  The who?  Hers?  Yeah.  Yes.  So are you interested in making a return to the Opie and Anthony show?  Is that what this is all about?  Yes, I will.  What type of things would you like to do?  But I don't want to talk about my past. 
[04:45:00]  No.  I don't want to talk about me being, you know, homeless or whatever.  Right.  How long were you homeless for?  We won't talk about it.  We will not talk about it.  How long were you homeless for?  And then we're not going to talk about it.  Oh, boy.  How long was it?  2004.  Yeah.  2006.  Maybe two years.  Yeah.  If I was homeless for two years, I probably wouldn't spend much time watching reruns after  I stopped being homeless.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no. 
[04:45:30]  Yeah, yeah.  After that, after that, after 2006, that's when I became un-homeless.  How'd you do that?  You just found the right dick?  Yeah, whatever.  Whatever you say.  How did you become un-homeless?  I don't understand.  Well, I met the right kind of person.  Dave is the dick.  But she doesn't fuck.  No, no, no.  It wasn't this guy that you're with now.  Yeah, he's still here.  That's the guy who got you un-homeless? 
[04:46:00]  Yeah.  And you never fucked him?  What?  You never fucked him?  Not really, no.  A little bit, though.  No.  Here and there.  Yeah.  What's he packing?  What's he packing?  Just in Spangville.  What's he packing?  This guy that you're roommates with.  Tell me how big his penis is.  I don't know.  You remember.  No.  All right, listen.  What?  Lady Di, what would you like to do on the Opie and Anthony show when you make your big return? 
[04:46:30]  I would like to talk to them.  Okay.  Well, so far you have not been very interesting after Opie and Anthony Live, so I just don't know if that will work out.  Is there anything else?  Do my Oliver Hardy routine again?  Will that work?  How does that go?  Well, I'm going to have my hair is going to be a little bit shorter than what it is right now.  My hair is kind of long right now.  Oh, good.  I'm glad for the back story.  Yeah.  And I used to do that thing with the mustache, with the Oliver Hardy thing. 
[04:47:00]  Right, yeah.  Well, I mean, that sounds not good.  I was pretty good at that.  Yeah, that doesn't sound good.  What else you got?  I don't know.  Hmm.  All right.  Well, it sounds great.  It sounds like you're on the road to recovery.  Do you have any sort of job options that you're looking at?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I'm thinking about, you know, going over to some places and applying for a cashier job.  Just like I said. 
[04:47:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Tell me again about this Ron Jeremy story.  So you go into the liquor store.  Right.  And then what happens?  I got to meet Ron Jeremy.  I know, but tell me exactly how the interaction went down.  Oh, he said hello to me.  I don't think anybody didn't see that one coming.  I thought that was clearer mile away.  Lady Di makes her big return to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's somewhat, at least to the Opie and Anthony channel. 
[04:48:00]  Lady Di was a fixture here for so long.  Was that too long?  Nah, not long enough.  You wanted to just keep her on.  You could have gone another five minutes and ended the show without her knowing.  Oh, yeah.  Just leave her on.  Well, hopefully she'll call back.  Holy Toledo.  And all those texts were absolutely true, by the way.  Uh, Nick in New Jersey.  Hey, how's it going, Sam?  How's it going, buddy?  Thank you for, uh, lasting through all that.  Uh, it's all good.  I was enjoying that. 
[04:48:30]  It was pretty interesting.  It's Lady Di.  Lady Di was, uh, she was on the Opie and Anthony show for years.  She hasn't been on in a long time, but she did.  She was one of the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, you've heard them mention that before.  Yeah.  Uh, I was, I was going to ask you for some advice, actually, because I was hoping to  ask Jim, but I, I mean, would you give you some advice?  Would that be all right?  Of course.  So, I have this new girlfriend, and she's, uh, she's, like, really great and everything,  but the thing is, she's, like, really, she posts these really, like, slutty pictures 
[04:49:00]  on Instagram.  Yeah.  So, I'm, like, the way she projects to me is she's not like that, but on Instagram,  she seems to be, you know?  Is she a freak in the bed?  Yes.  All right.  Well, you know what?  Maybe you get over the Instagram pictures and just take advantage of that fun while you  can.  Eventually, you'll get bored of it, and then the Instagram pictures won't matter anymore.  You could leave her behind.  Well, I, I'm thinking, I'm thinking that she could be, like, you know, the potential, she 
[04:49:30]  seems to be, like, really good for me, you know?  That's just the one thing that's bothered me.  How old is she?  20.  Okay, so she's, and how old are you?  20.  Okay, so you guys are very young.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, you see what happens.  If it actually bothers you and you want to have a relationship with this girl, you can't  have her posting slutty pictures on Instagram.  How long have you been with her?  Just, like, two months.  Do you think I should say something to her?  I don't know.  Two months in, and she's liable to think you're controlling. 
[04:50:00]  I would say, have you told her, have you guys, do you guys say you love each other?  Yeah.  You do?  Yeah.  Okay, so you're 100% committed.  You're saying, I love you.  Yeah, but you know what?  If you could say it without being offensive.  If you go, you know what?  These pictures are just, they're kind of bothering me.  I know it's my issue, but I feel uncomfortable.  And maybe, hopefully, if she is the person that you want her to be, she'll hear that and  say, okay, I didn't realize it was making you uncomfortable. 
[04:50:30]  I'll stop doing it.  Yeah, because I'm just thinking, like, what really pushes someone to do that, you know,  besides, like, getting attention?  Yeah, it's attention.  That's all it is.  So I'm just, like, I'm wondering why she would want to do that.  She wants attention.  I mean, it's easy for good-looking girls to get attention that way.  And that's all it's about.  But if you can go and say, this is making me uncomfortable, and you're telling me that  you think this girl is the one, at least right now, you know, then she should be able  to listen to that and do that. 
[04:51:00]  But you just, you can't be hostile about it.  You have to say, look, you know, this is just, to be honest, this is kind of bothering  me, and I know it's silly, and I know it's my issue, but I just have to tell you, because  I don't want this to come up in other ways, I don't want to start resenting it, blah,  blah, blah.  You know what I mean?  I appreciate that.  All right, buddy.  I'll talk to you later.  Good luck.  Thanks.  Hey!  I can give advice.  That's pretty good, right?  You weren't listening, were you, Sal?  You could have learned a lot.  You could have learned a lot. 
[04:51:30]  Let's go to Rob in Canada.  What's up, Rob?  Hey, buddy.  It's Ladman.  What's up, buddy?  I really want a Sudoku puzzle, or a mixtape, or something.  All right.  Actually, I got Sudoku puzzles in the office.  Stay on hold.  I'm going to give you an Opie Sudoku puzzle and a mixtape.  Hold on.  Let's go to Manny in Oakland.  What's up, Manny?  What's up, Sam?  How you doing, buddy?  You want a T-shirt?  Yeah.  Hey, hey.  Hey.  How did you get that girl's Instagram page? 
[04:52:00]  I was in a rush, I guess.  I really should have.  What's up?  You waited her a quick.  Yeah, I'm a rookie at this.  Hang on.  Your phone's dropping out, but stay on hold.  We'll give you a mixtape.  Dave in Chicago, you're a new listener?  Yes, sir.  I certainly am.  I love you guys.  Thanks, buddy.  Man, that lady died.  No wonder her old man threw himself in front of a train.  I would have, too.  She's horrible.  Is she not?  Oh, my God. 
[04:52:30]  She wags right up there with that fucking nutcase Marianne on the 101 channel or 100  or whatever, guys.  On Howard's channel?  Yeah.  The thing is, it's like people like her, you don't want to bully people.  You don't want to abuse people.  But people like her get you so mad that even the nicest person will say, all I want is terrible  things to happen to her.  That's all I want in life.  Yeah.  I'm telling you.  All right, Dave.  I'll talk to you later.  If Dave's a new listener, you should go get the podcast.  Yeah, go get the podcast, Dave.  I don't know what he's talking about, Howard's nerd.
