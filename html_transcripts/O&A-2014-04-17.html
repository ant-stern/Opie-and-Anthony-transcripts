<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a pre-show hosted by Sam Roberts, heavily focused on the backlash surrounding limited-edition 20th-anniversary posters.  Listeners angrily called in, feeling entitled to a poster due to their subscriptions. The posters featured Opie, Anthony, and various show alumni including Bobby Kelly, Patrice O’Neal, Louis C.K., Jimmy Fallon, Guy Fieri, and John Cena, along with Sam Roberts himself.  The discussion included logistics of production and distribution, with Sam explaining the associated costs.  Rich Voss angrily reacted to a viral video of a Southwest Airlines flight attendant’s comedic safety demonstration, feeling it devalued his profession. This led to a discussion of other viral fame instances.  Surprise guests Dean Norris and Christopher Maloney promoted their movie, *Small Time*, but the conversation frequently returned to Voss’s grievance.  Numerous calls centered around Roland, a seemingly obscure figure from the show with a dedicated fanbase. A street experiment by Opie, Anthony, and Patrice O’Neal, testing whether a cab driver would pick up a Black man versus a man dressed as a Nazi, was discussed at length. Other topics included listener complaints about show spending on Howard Stern's birthday, a purported Q&A with Princess Diana on 4chan, news about Anthony Weiner, a rapper who reportedly cut off his penis and jumped from a balcony, a retrospective segment of show clips, and a call from someone claiming to be Marion from a "retarded Laverne and Shirley" angry about a missed Unmasked event. The pre-show concluded with a preview of a segment on the Las Vegas Ferris wheel.

The main show opened with Ann recounting a disastrous date involving a CB radio, horses, and a much larger-than-expected “Dreamweaver.” The conversation then shifted to the poorly-made 20th-anniversary poster, prompting further debate about its design, online promotion photograph, and the appropriate pen for signing (Sharpies vs. paint pens).  This led to numerous listener calls and a highly detailed, graphic description of a vomiting incident during a studio stunt called "The Baby Bird." The show also included tangents about past stunts and various show personalities and listeners.

The next segment focused on the signing of 300 posters, with much discussion on the choice of marker (eventually settling on Sharpies) and the placement of signatures.  John Gray, overseeing the Las Vegas High Roller Ferris wheel, appeared as a guest. This led to a discussion about a rumored Lorde/George Brett connection, Rowdy Roddy Piper's 60th birthday, and a host's anecdote about soiling their pants in Las Vegas.  Numerous advertisements aired, including for Rosetta Stone, Mama Mancini's meatballs, and several others.  A "Yente Explorers" segment with Marge and Gertrude was played, interspersed with discussion about ACDC’s (falsely reported) breakup.  A clip of Anthony Weiner on Fusion TV was shown, followed by discussion of his sexting. A lengthy discussion and playback of a Billy Crystal stand-up routine and a scene from *Punchline* followed, with commentary on the acting and jokes.  A caller named Bobo, who missed an event due to a late call, was on the air briefly.

The following segment focused on preparations for the "Unmasked" 20th-anniversary show with Ron Bennington.  The hosts discussed poster-signing frustrations with staff member Don and graphically described and discussed a rapper who severed his penis and attempted suicide, playing audio clips related to the event.  They also discussed a penis documentary and a man wanting to donate his penis to a museum, playing audio clips of the man and the curator.  Several callers were on-air, including Bobo's mother, expressing displeasure.  John Gray was interviewed again. The broadcast included many explicit references to genitalia and sexual acts.

A segment heavily featured the High Roller Observation Wheel in Las Vegas, with a Caesars Entertainment representative discussing its construction, size (larger cabins than the studio), capacity (40 people per cabin), safety features, and impact on tourism.  Humorous asides about intoxicated passengers, vomit cleanup, and the wheel’s scale were included.  The conversation then shifted to the "Unmasked" show, including its format, guests (Selene Seinfeld, Elton John, and acts at the Brooklyn Bowl), and logistics at Caroline's on Broadway.  The segment covered behind-the-scenes moments, including a failed Valerie Harper photo opportunity.  Numerous advertisements were also aired.

The show concluded with a "Baby Diaper Mustache Day" stunt.  Opie applied baby feces to his lip to create a mustache, leading to repeated vomiting from one of the hosts (Bobby) due to the smell and sight.  The segment included numerous off-color jokes and descriptions of the feces.  Later, the hosts discussed a Britney Spears virginity auction joke and a promotion involving a difficult-to-open container.

[00:01:00]  this good. Welcome to the Opie and Anthony pre-show with Sam Roberts.  Welcome to the pre-show on a very special day. We're live. It's the Thursday pre-show,  counting down before the live Opie and Anthony show hits the airwaves today. It is unmasked 
[00:01:30]  day. Finally, unmasked has arrived. That's going down later this afternoon. That will also  be live on the channel. But that's not, I mean, this Opie and Anthony show, you talk about workhorses  of satellite radio. My God. They're doing a live morning show for all of us. Then,  coming in this afternoon, going to Caroline's on Broadway, there'll be a select few who get  to watch it live. But everybody else will get to listen live here on the Opie and Anthony 
[00:02:00]  channel. And if your friends are SiriusXM subscribers but don't have the Opie and Anthony channel, they  can listen on Raw Dog, SiriusXM 99. It's going to be great. I'm sure that we're going to talk  about that a lot today and what's going to go down with that. Opie and Anthony have a  whole bunch of posters to sign today. I'm sure we'll hear about that as the posters were  a big part of yesterday's show. In fact, why don't we start with that? Because I'm going 
[00:02:30]  to tell you something. You know what the worst part about having the Opie and Anthony show  on all day is? The fact that we're now replaying the entire channel. Is Opie and Anthony replays?  Well, obviously the live show and then replays. All day. I couldn't, I just decided not to  tweet yesterday because all day long I was getting requests for posters followed by something 
[00:03:00]  insulting. That's all I got. I mean, hundreds if not thousands of tweets flooded my  account asking for posters. I do not have the posters to give to you. And everybody's  like, wow, what about us? It's like, well, we didn't make 10,000 posters to just give  away for free for no reason. I don't have posters. And the posters was a big deal at the top  of the show yesterday. Sal, let's go to track three.  The posters are ready to be signed. How many people would actually, you know, want one of 
[00:03:30]  these? Another, maybe less than are in this box, maybe another thousand. So what's the  big deal? No, there's going to be a lot of people want these things. Stop underestimating  your audience, right? No, things have to be special. They got your Carlin picture in  here, which is nice. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Nice. Very nice. Opie and Topey, the newspaper.  This is good, man. Yeah, it's cool. It's a cool poster. Is there any of us in here?  Uh, yes. Is there really? Yep. Bobby Kelly, Burr, Patrice Attell, um, Louis C.K.? 
[00:04:00]  There's Louis here, Fallon's here, John Cena. Fallon, nice. Guy Fieri, Anthony on stage  and some awful, that might be Anthony on stage right now. It's like a, obviously a collage  and, uh, the fire. Right, the Hulkster made it. Opie and Anthony Van. It's really cool.  So picture Sam in the corner, which makes me kind of ill. A wow sticker.  Why is Sam on our poster? Big A. I think they should have had a bigger picture of you guys  on there. You think? Yeah. The official opening Anthony 20 year poster. There you go. Hashtag 
[00:04:30]  what? Hashtag OA20. But OA20 is not going to work on, uh, Instagram. Why not? It just  won't. Yeah, it will. I guarantee it won't. What do you mean won't work? How will it not  work? I don't know. The official opening Anthony 20 year poster. Okay, I just tweeted  that. Oh, I was looking for a photo of Club Soda Kenny. Right. And the big zero in 20  is over his face. Oh, really? Appropriate. Yeah. If you look, that's his photo with Gary 
[00:05:00]  Coleman behind the zero. And you could see Gary Coleman's little face. Oh, yeah, yeah,  yeah. And a tiny little sliver of Kenny's head. It's tiny and they're, they only have  20 of them. Great. It's a good eight by 16. Just open it up and whoever wants a poster they  can mail, mail in for a poster or something or, or whatever. I don't know. They're limited  edition. Fuck limited edition. We'll photocopy this one and send it. Right. Fuck limited  edition. That should be available for everybody. I mean, we're going to try to get more posters 
[00:05:30]  made. I believe Don Wiki Wickland has, uh, has agreed very begrudgingly to have some more  posters made. We're trying to find somebody to pay for a ton of posters to be made. That's  all it is. Posters cost money. The listeners don't want to pay for them. So somebody's got  to. 866-WOW1-WOW. 866-969-1969. If you'd like to call the pre-show this morning and, uh,  yap about everything that happened yesterday on the show and, uh, everything that's going 
[00:06:00]  to happen today, not only on the Opie and Anthony show, but also on Unmasked with Opie  and Anthony. Let's go to Snowy in Michigan. What's up, Snowy?  Samuel, how are you doing today, sir?  Good, buddy.  Um, I'm going to call you out a little bit, sir.  Oh, no.  I believe you have an ulterior motive for wanting this poster to stay exclusive and want to make  a different poster for everybody else. You are the only person on the production center 
[00:06:30]  be on this exclusive poster, correct?  Uh, I think so. Yeah, E-Rock wasn't on it. He should have been, but yeah.  Exactly. Now, I don't think he should put everybody on the staff. I think E-Rock should be on there.  Yeah, I agree, but I get where you're going with this theory, but wouldn't, if I was in  it for, if I was in business for myself, as they say, wouldn't I want the poster with  my face on it to be mass-produced, not limited?  Yeah, that's a good point there, Sam. Um, but couldn't, I mean, don't make the thing 
[00:07:00]  exclusive? Wouldn't it be kind of cool, just, the people who show up with the unmask  get the signed exclusive one, as opposed to everybody else that's getting one that's  unsigned?  I guess, but then Opie said on the air yesterday, no, I want to sign every single one of them.  I don't, I don't know what's going to happen. I, I, I hope you get one, Snowy. Whatever  we have to give, I hope you get it.  Let's see what it looks like. I don't necessarily, you know, I don't want to, I don't want to  bust up the exclusiveness of the whole photo by having a normal fan like me, because  I'm not a super fan like Eric or everything else, but. 
[00:07:30]  I don't know, I don't know, Snowy. You call in every day, you're a regular, you're becoming  a super fan. I gotta, I mean, the fact that this poster thing has become, we just try to  do something nice. This is why we can't have nice things around here. We try to do something  nice, we try to do something special, and it becomes a giant to-do. Well, speaking of giant  to-dos, Voss was on the show yesterday, and every time Voss comes in, it becomes a to-do,  because we've got to take care of this guy. Voss comes in, and we watched a video that's 
[00:08:00]  been all over the internet of a call, not a, of a flight attendant, decided, wanting to  be a comedian. So this flight attendant for Southwest Airlines goes out and starts doing  like a stand-up routine as her, here's how you buckle a seatbelt spiel that all flight  attendants do before the flight. So we watched the video together, and Voss took umbrage with 
[00:08:30]  it. Sal, let's move to track nine.  Yeah, I've flown Southwest, and the male guys try to do this.  The male guys?  The male attendant, or the male.  The male guy? Who says the male guys?  It's just males and females. Oh, no, there is other options. My mistake.  My bad.  All right, Claire.  It's lighthearted.  Yeah, it was lighthearted fun. It didn't hurt anybody.  Voss is a crank.  How mad are you going to be when that gets her on Ellen DeGeneres or Jimmy Fallon? 
[00:09:00]  Not at all.  Well, you're mad she's on the plane, but you won't be mad when she's on Ellen DeGeneres.  The girl that sang her house.  See, this is what you've got to do to get on Ellen. Get on a flight and do a little stand-up.  Besides the fact she's stealing your bit, sir.  Absolutely.  But you're too stupid to know that.  You started this bit doing comedy in weird places. Remember?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What I'm saying is...  He doesn't remember, does he?  Yeah, I do. At Starbucks and at the roof, the diner, I would do a Starbucks tour. 
[00:09:30]  And now I lost my train of...  You know what?  Look at the girl that did the black chick that did the rap about the fire, her house.  You know, do you remember that on YouTube? It was big, you know.  How did it go?  How are you such a bad explainer?  Because I don't remember...  How does it go? You brought it up.  Everybody knows the black chick when her house was burning and did a fucking rap behind her after the fire.  She goes, oh, Lord, or oh, God, or whatever. 
[00:10:00]  No.  I don't know what you mean, Rich.  She was just a regular person.  Are you talking about, oh, Lord, there was a fire?  Yeah, that one, yeah.  She didn't do a rap?  Well, she did whatever.  She was just talking.  Let me tell you the business.  She got an agent after that, and they were booking her in places.  That's what happens.  I know.  So, of course, she'd become a flight attendant.  You'll get an agent.  Exactly.  Going back to my point, next time you're on a flight, you fly all the time.  Do that.  It was so great to watch this because, obviously, the reason that we brought the video to the show's attention anyway was because it was the exact thing that this show would rally against. 
[00:10:30]  But the minute everybody in the room saw Voss speaking so passionately against it, everybody just turned on him for no reason.  Everybody put aside whatever their personal beliefs were to make sure that everybody got their shots in at poor Rich Voss.  Let's go to Kevin in New Hampshire.  Welcome to the pre-show, Kevin.  What's going on, Sam?  Not too much.  Hey, so I'm really not too happy with you, man, this whole limited edition shit. 
[00:11:00]  That kind of sucks.  I understand.  But do you understand?  I'd like to go to the Unmasked, but I'm stuck crisscrossing the country.  So you're inhibiting my ability to secure one of these 20th anniversary posters.  Yeah, I got it.  But do you understand the logistics of just saying, hey, we're making posters for Unmasked.  You know what?  Like, let's just make them for all listeners everywhere. 
[00:11:30]  I've been listening to Opie and Anthony's just said at WAF days.  And that's the other thing.  Everybody was tweeting me being like, you know, I'm a paying subscriber.  I deserve blah, blah, blah.  Opie and Anthony provide you with entertainment.  You pay for satellite radio or you listen and you provide your loyalty and we appreciate it and we try to do nice things.  I don't want to pay for mine.  I don't care.  But the fact that you want to make it a special thing or building up to a bigger event, that's kind of ridiculous. 
[00:12:00]  We're having events for the show.  Hopefully fans can make it to the events.  But if you can't, you can't, it's like if you go to, if you're a big fan of, I don't know, what's a band that you're a fan of?  What kind of music do you like?  I listen to a lot of Bush.  Okay.  All right.  Look, Bush is a terrible example.  But let's say Bush decided to go back on tour for some ungodly reason and Gavin goes and gets the Bush mates back together and they all start going on tour and you can't make the show. 
[00:12:30]  But they have an exclusive poster for the show.  Are you going to email Gavin and say, Gavin, I've been listening to you for years.  Why can't I get a poster?  He's not going to mass produce them.  First of all, he's not going to give them away for free.  He's going to sell them.  Second of all, and this is Gavin, by the way, selling them himself.  It's not like they have a staff around them anymore.  Second of all, he's not going to make enough so that every single person gets one. 
[00:13:00]  He's going to make enough because it's celebrating the concert.  You there, Kevin?  I don't think so.  Yeah, I'm here.  All right.  Did I make my point?  No.  All right.  It's ridiculous.  You know what's ridiculous?  It's 2014.  Stop listening to Bush.  Goodbye.  That's what's ridiculous.  Okay?  Look at the calendar, for God's sake.  Let's move on to Glenn in Boston.  What's up, Glenn? 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  You helped me get, son of a bitch.  How are you this morning?  I'm good.  I feel like Superfan Eric right now.  I'm getting all fired up.  Well, they had since fixed it, but at the beginning of the show, it said post-show instead of free show on the pad data.  Sal, why did you write post-show on the pad data?  That was silly.  Dude, I got a lot going on this morning.  I'm swamped with work.  You know, I just, I can't, I can't deal with that.  All right.  This sounds like excuses after excuses. 
[00:14:00]  Thank you for being on top of things, Glenn.  I just want to go on record.  I don't like the new format with you on the free show and you on the post-show.  So why'd you call in?  I liked it better before.  All right.  All right.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  I don't know.  Like, don't, who calls the show and says, I just want to say, you know, no disrespect, but I don't like it.  Well, then it's fine.  Like, go back to sleep or something.  It's goddamn six o'clock in the morning.  Yeah.  Go listen to Bush for a while or something. 
[00:14:30]  We got into more with Voss and who's allowed to be funny in terms of show business as the show continued yesterday.  Yeah.  Let's go to track 10.  44 million views.  That's great, though.  I mean, she's so funny.  She's just naturally funny.  There are people that are just naturally funny.  I don't know if she can translate that to stand up.  No, it's great.  She's naturally funny.  No, she was just, you know, I remember that news clip.  Yeah, she was just describing something. 
[00:15:00]  She wasn't even trying to be funny.  So what's wrong with her getting famous, though?  Stop, stop.  First of all, all she did was say, hey, my God, the people that cut that and made that.  We understand.  We don't think that she did that in the rehearsal studio.  The original clip has 49 million of her just being herself.  Oh, it does, right?  Yes.  But what I'm saying is it's you're taking somebody just because they got that many hits and you turn them into a star.  It's just a whole entertainment game.  But you're saying that he ain't got time for that.  The other guy I think is hilarious, too.  Hold on.  Who's hilarious?  Hilarious. 
[00:15:30]  Hilarious.  Let me explain something to you.  You don't say it.  If you've got a video on YouTube that gets 49 million views of you being yourself, people are, of course, going to look at that and go, wow, she has an audience.  We can make money off that.  Yes.  That's what I'm saying.  We're full of.  What's wrong with that?  People don't click videos to the tune of 49 million unless it's interesting to them.  That's right, Rich.  I mean, people used to get deals because they were good on TV.  That's right.  Now people watch the Internet.  Hunk of shit.  Oh, Voss. 
[00:16:00]  It was a war zone.  It was a battlefield yesterday on the Opie and Anthony show.  I mean, I was getting it for the posters.  Voss was getting it just for being Voss.  Listen to the way the show started yesterday.  We weren't the only ones getting it.  Sal, let's go to track one.  Christ, what's the problem?  Why was it just silence?  We know we're on now.  We're talking. 
[00:16:30]  B-Rock, are we on now?  B-Rock comes running in.  We're on now.  And then he gets mad at us.  We're sitting here talking.  He walks in and goes, we're on now.  How?  He's slow.  He really isn't an observant person.  No, he's on a break, kid.  He's got a good heart.  All right, well.  He means well.  War zone yesterday.  Absolute battlefield.  It was one of those days where you know wherever you walk, it's just landmines under your feet. 
[00:17:00]  So all you can do is just realize you're not going to survive it.  You're not walking out of there alive.  Let's go to James in Toronto.  James, welcome to the pre-show.  Hey, Sammy, sweetheart.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  Good, man.  I ran a Q&A with Lady Di yesterday on 4chan.  What was Lady Di doing on 4chan?  Well, the way it worked is she called me. 
[00:17:30]  And then she would answer the questions over the phone that I would read to her for people while I was on 4chan.  Questions like, do you miss your husband?  Have you ever heard of 4chan?  Is Roland gay?  How come Roland gets treated with kid gloves?  James, you don't have to sneak in the Roland calls.  I take them every time.  I find that unlikely.  I take in 150 Roland calls.  I take them on the pre-show.  I take them on the post-show. 
[00:18:00]  All right, cool.  Let's talk about this then.  We did yesterday.  You're obsessed.  You've got to relax.  You're taking my call today.  I just did take your call.  I'm talking to you.  Yeah, but not about Roland.  We're talking right now.  All right, so is Roland gay?  Yes, Roland is gay.  There you go.  You have the answer now.  Mystery solved.  There's like a little sect of fans that are obsessed with Roland.  It's amazing. 
[00:18:30]  Like, yesterday on the post-show, we talked about Roland and whether or not he gets treated  with kid gloves.  And I gave an explanation.  I don't know what possible other explanation I could give you on that.  But if you want to talk about Roland, feel free to call 866-WOW-1-WOW.  And I will gladly talk to you about him.  I don't know.  Nobody needs to sneak calls in on the pre-show.  I take every single one.  The one call a minute ago just said, I want to yell at Sam because he's a douche.  And I took him.  All of them.  I don't care. 
[00:19:00]  It's the pre-show, for God's sakes.  I want to give you a voice.  You feel me?  I think so.  Voss was back on this flight attendant thing.  Yesterday, we had some surprise guests come by.  And they were great.  Dean Norris from Breaking Bad and Christopher Maloney, formerly from SVU, both stopped  by unannounced.  We found out, you know, half an hour before they were coming in that they wanted to stop  by.  We were like, of course.  And they came in to talk about their movie, Small Time. 
[00:19:30]  But Voss wanted to gain some support for his theory about the flight attendant.  So he decided to bring it up with the Hollywood actors when they came in.  It got a little weird just before you walked in.  You guys are two accomplished actors.  If you got on a plane and two flight attendants started doing a scene together, would you  fucking go, this is ridiculous?  It depends on the scene, brother.  I mean, if it was from Oz, I'd say more.  Give me more.  If they were the U.S. air tweet, then they were doing that, you know. 
[00:20:00]  Hey!  With a little...  There's a viral video where the flight attendant did stand-up, and these guys are very, very  good at that.  And they're offended?  Are you offended by it?  So he's very annoyed by it.  Yeah, I hear you.  I hear you.  I hear you.  I hear you.  And it demeans what I do for a while.  Right, I hear you.  Exactly.  And there's nothing a comedian hates more than joy being spread.  Oh, shut up.  Fucking bright-eyed douchebag.  I'm a happy person.  I like to spread happiness. 
[00:20:30]  I hear you.  I hear you.  No, I'm fucking degrading.  You got Dean Norris on your side, Mitch.  I hear you, man.  So Dean Norris was trying to be nice.  He goes, I hear you.  Like, I know what you're saying.  I get why you'd be offended by that.  And Voss decided to take that moment and completely ruin any sort of stock he had in his relationship  with Dean Norris.  Sal, let's move to track 13.  I just saw you in a movie, and I'm trying to picture which one recently.  What was the last movie you did?  Frozen Ground I did with Nick Cage. 
[00:21:00]  Get down!  Get down!  Get down!  I'd say that, I think.  In every movie I've ever done.  What movie?  What movie, Rich?  I can't think of it.  We watch a movie every Sunday night.  Is it an old movie?  A new movie?  Was it in theater?  I could tell that it was riveting, apparently.  It was.  It was.  It was a good movie.  Die Hard?  Great.  Die Hard?  He's not good at explaining things.  The first one?  I want this job, man.  What do you say?  Can we get around?  Yeah, you can easily do this.  Just get high like you guys.  Get high with you guys and get drunk. 
[00:21:30]  So you saw him in a movie, and it was good, but you don't know what the movie was or what  he did in it?  I see him in a movie.  Fucking 10 movies.  Well, then why would you bring it up?  It's really embarrassing now, man.  You're sure you're not mistaking Dean for me?  No.  Or me for Michael Chiklis.  I met you at the Dennis Leary roast years ago.  I'm stalking you.  But you, please.  No, you have no memory of him, do you?  No, none whatsoever.  No, no.  That was really high at the time.  I mean, you usually set up a thought in your head. 
[00:22:00]  Like, if the actor is in the room with you, you know if you don't know the name of his  movie.  And most people would think to themselves, okay, I would like to bring up the movie that  I just saw him in, but I don't remember what movie it was, so I won't.  There's something, that thing isn't in Voss's head.  And he'll just say, yeah, I saw you in a movie without realizing that there's no, there's  nowhere to go after that.  Like, there's no follow through on it.  It's hilarious.  It's hilarious yesterday on the show. 
[00:22:30]  I'm going to try to run through some of these phones quick, because there's a lot of calls  today.  Everybody must be excited about this Unmasked that's coming up later on this afternoon  here on the Opie and Anthony channel.  It'll be live at 4 p.m. Eastern.  Let's go to Buck Walter in D.C.  What's up, Buck Walter?  Hey, man.  Hey, I just wonder if you could frame my copy of the poster.  Look, I don't think I'm going to send you a poster.  Bob in Minnesota.  What's up, Bob?  Morning.  Morning, buddy.  Hey, well, how can they justify spending all this money on Howard Sturton's birthday 
[00:23:00]  this last month?  And, you know, they don't give you guys any props.  I think that's a little ridiculous.  I mean, we'd all like to have that kind of money spent on us, but I think it's because  they said, OK, we'll spend a whole bunch of money on the birthday party.  It'll end up in newspapers.  I don't know if any newspapers are going to be reporting on the fact that Opie and Anthony  gave out free posters to everybody.  Michael in Phoenix.  What's up, Michael?  Hey, Sammy, boy.  How are you doing? 
[00:23:30]  Good.  Nah, I just want to say I totally agree with you.  100% it should be a limited edition.  Make it special.  Yeah, make it special.  Why?  I mean, you know, it's only going to happen.  20 years is 20 years.  Right.  And there'll be other things and other posters for everybody to get.  Let's go all the way to South Korea.  Daniel, you're on the pre-show.  Crime time.  How are you doing today?  Good, buddy.  Got two quick questions.  Yes.  One, now that you got Fez fired, who's next? 
[00:24:00]  Roland or E-Rock?  And secondly, can I have a poster, please?  Okay, number one, I did not get Fez fired.  I do not know that he is fired.  I believe he's still working here, but I don't know the inner workings of that.  And number two, absolutely not, because the Unmasked is not happening in South Korea, so you will not be getting a poster.  Joe in Texas, you're on the pre-show.  Hey, Sammy, please, for Christ's sake, tell me the band's still out for Bobo and the Twin Pigs.  As far as I know, Bobo is not coming to Unmasked today, but he did call in to Ron and Fez yesterday. 
[00:24:30]  Did you hear about that?  And he name-dropped Sal's name.  Why?  He said on Ron and Fez, he called Ron yesterday on Ron and Fez, Bobo did this, and we'll have the audio on today's Opie and Anthony show.  And he said that Sal texted him and said, if he can get there, he won't be kicked out.  So he called Ron and said, is there a plus one that somebody has that I could have?  Which I don't, I think, I think what's, what. 
[00:25:00]  I told him twice that we don't have tickets for him, but he's not going to get kicked out of the event.  I think Sal was just saying that there was a rumor going around that he may show up with somebody.  So I guess Sal was just putting him at ease saying, look, if somebody just gave you a ticket, then whatever.  As long as you behave yourself, we'll kind of just quietly bring you in.  He took that to mean I need to call Ron.  And it's a plus one.  You can't call and ask, hi, I'd like a plus one just for me.  Yeah. 
[00:25:30]  No, I don't need a ticket.  Just the plus one part.  Whoever's.  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  Harley in Florida.  Hey, Sammy Sweetheart, how you doing today?  Good, buddy.  Hey, you got to explain to some of these stupid-ass listeners you've got.  How are you?  The posters that are going out, they're just pretty unmasked.  Yeah.  Those are the limited edition ones.  Right.  They just don't understand it.  You got to explain to them that you'll put out other 20th anniversary posters for everybody else to get. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, we'll have stuff.  And yeah, I'm all for it.  Thanks, dude.  You're right.  I'm all for putting out another poster, but this poster thing has just gotten to be way too much.  Real quick, I want to hear Voss.  We were talking about Otto from Otto and George yesterday, Otto Peterson, who passed away.  Voss was in studio, and this was his Otto story.  I remember one night we were getting high.  You used to get high with him? 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, we went to his house.  Me, Bastille.  Bastille was a heroin addict.  I was a coke addict, and Otto would just like to get high.  And we went to his, I think he had a place in Staten Island, and we're so fucked up.  It's the middle of the night, and there was a big booker back then, Rick Messina, who manages Staten Island.  Yeah, we talked about him.  We know Rick.  So, Rick.  Rick loved Otto.  I know.  But we're sitting there, half nodding, and out of nowhere, Otto would pop and go, fuck Messina. 
[00:27:00]  Right?  He goes, I call him, he goes, I'm talking to the coast, and I'll go, I'm on the coast, the east coast, right?  And then we're nodding, and he just wake up and go, fuck Gary Grant, right?  And it was just so funny.  And we were starving, and we go, do you have anything to eat?  He had open a can.  He had one can of fucking beans.  So, like, it was like three fucking drug guys, hi, Otto cooked us beans, right?  And we sat and ate fucking beans. 
[00:27:30]  Being a drug addict sounds awful.  Yeah, I know.  But we had no fun.  We had so much fun that night.  Right.  I mean, we had so much fun.  That was Voss' story.  I mean, the callers are going crazy on today's pre-show.  I think everybody is psyched about the fact that Unmasked is coming up.  We're going to talk about Unmasked a lot on the show today, I'm sure.  We'll talk about the posters.  Everybody still wants to talk about posters.  I'm sure for those of you that want to talk about Roland, we can talk about Roland if you want to.  But we've got a ton, a lot of penis news to get to. 
[00:28:00]  There's a trailer for a penis documentary that I want to show the guys.  There's a really funny clip on TMZ.  A rapper cut off his penis and jumped off a balcony.  So TMZ found two other rappers that were there with the guy,  and they're just acting like TMZ is the police.  They're going, I don't know what you're talking about, man.  No, I don't know.  I don't know.  So I'm sure we'll get into that.  And Anthony Weiner was asked again.  Now he's asked if he's still sexting. 
[00:28:30]  And his response was just terrific.  So we'll get into all of that on today's Opie and Anthony show.  Superfan Eric is on the phone.  Todd and Burlington is on the phone.  Hopefully I'm going to get to both of you.  I don't know if we're going to have time.  Because right now we go to Marion, the best friend of Lady Di.  Hey, Sam.  How are you?  I'm good.  Marion, of course, from the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Let me tell you something about me and the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  I am very pissed off that Opie and Anthony are letting me, 
[00:29:00]  and not having me and Diane there today at this.  I'm mad.  And I'm going to tell you something.  He's very, very, very upset.  I don't know what's going on with Bobo,  because Diane hasn't heard from him.  I don't know if he's allowed to go.  But me and Diane have been a part of that show for 20 years,  and you guys are not letting us go there.  And I think it's fucking wrong.  These are both assholes.  Bye, Sam.  That's it?  You hanging up?  She hung up. 
[00:29:30]  That was it.  I don't think she's been with the show for 20 years.  But, I don't know.  I'm going to give that clip for sure to Opie and Anthony today.  Super fan Eric, Todd from Burlington, you guys.  I'm going to talk to you guys tomorrow, all right?  I love both of you.  But we have to ramp up as the Opie and Anthony show is about to begin.  As I said, everything that I just listed will be a part of today's Opie and Anthony show.  We're going to ramp up towards this afternoon's Live Unmasked. 
[00:30:00]  The guy who's responsible for that giant Ferris wheel in Las Vegas that we were talking about a couple weeks ago or last week,  he will be in studio today.  He's going to be a great guest.  Vegas people are always interesting.  Just so many people they interact with.  But first, a special treat because it's a special day.  We here at the Opie and Anthony love to treat the listeners.  That's why this poster thing has become such a phenomenon.  What we're going to do right now, before the Opie and Anthony show begins, is give you a little retrospective. 
[00:30:30]  It's Unmasked Day.  So we wanted to do something a little non-traditional.  And I wouldn't call it a best of.  But we've taken some of the best moments over the last 20 years of the Opie and Anthony show.  Just to give you some context of what this really means.  And we've put it together for you, Eric, I've been told, has done a great job on this.  And we wanted to start today with some Opie and Anthony retrospective. 
[00:31:00]  Stay tuned through this.  Enjoy it.  And Opie and Anthony will be live right after this.  ONA's 20th Anniversary Retrospective.  Where are you at?  I'm down right in front of the doorway.  I'm in the elevator.  We're waiting for you to come down so you could observe, give a little play-by-play.  I am out here with Patrice, who has turned his hat a little sideways. 
[00:31:30]  He was practicing how he's going to hail the cab in the mirror in the elevator in a very intimidating fashion.  It barely looks like he's doing anything.  It looks like he's going to rob the...  Oh, sorry, I'm distracted.  The guy is kicking us out of the doorway.  My God.  You'd think a Nazi could stand in a doorway of a building here in a free nation like the United States of America.  So we're going to go...  Yeah, we're going to go...  You're going to have to be first. 
[00:32:00]  And I'll probably be like right here.  So we're going to do it here or are we going to do it at 6th Ave?  I think we should just do it here.  Yeah.  Yeah, see, there goes a cab.  There are a lot of cabs available, which is good.  But you should go down a little further.  And then we have to put our mics down and Opio will describe the scene.  Because we don't want them to look like the cabs to think that this is some kind of ruse or something.  Well, these people are going to wreck it. 
[00:32:30]  They've got to stay up here.  Yeah, tell them to come this way.  Yeah, you guys stay up here, please.  All right, we're going down.  You go down by the corner a little bit, Patrice.  And I'll stand kind of by the phone booth.  All right, we're setting this up.  What are we doing?  Best of seven?  Yeah, best of seven.  Best of seven.  Hold your mic down.  Anthony, if you're just holding it.  What?  Just so I can get some kind of sound from you guys.  Just kind of have the mics held.  Yeah, in front of you.  You've got to be a little bit closer to me so he can see you. 
[00:33:00]  He can't see you from there.  Yeah.  Oh, he'll see me, though.  He'll see me.  I'm going to sit on the planter here.  Wait in.  Yeah.  Here comes the bus.  After the bus passes, game on.  And I think you need to be a little closer.  I think you need to be where the bus is after the bus passes.  Yeah, you've got to be closer to me.  Because the cab has to see both of you at the same time.  All right.  And then make that decision.  Okay.  Because it's almost weird close.  Close.  Like close.  Yeah, close.  Like with his fucking, like here. 
[00:33:30]  No, not.  Well, then they're going to think that you're both together.  Yeah, yeah.  I like this distance.  I would never pick up a nigga and a Nazi.  All right.  For you at home, these guys are like a bus length apart.  Yeah.  You've got Patrice all ghettoed out.  Patrice, you look downright scary.  All right.  The second this thing goes by, now we've got to start.  And Anthony with his Nazi helmet.  Game on.  As soon as that light turns green, game on.  Yes. 
[00:34:00]  Stand like this.  All right.  Patrice has his arm up.  Ant, get your arm up.  Thank you, sir.  Hold on.  Keep going.  All right.  There's a cab.  He's confused.  He's stopped.  He has passed.  He has passed?  Oh, Nazi!  Nazi!  Fucking!  Why didn't you pick up the African gentleman?  You motherfucker!  I stopped.  You see me?  I stopped.  You didn't stop for a nigga!  You stopped to pick up the African gentleman?  But then you put... 
[00:34:30]  You see that I'm a Nazi?  You picked up a Nazi over a nigga!  I stopped.  I stopped.  And you see me stopping, right?  I stopped.  And I see maybe...  You chose the Nazi, brother?  You chose Nazi over a nigga?  You chose the Nazi, brother?  Wow!  Come on, brother!  You don't pick up a fucking Nazi?  All right, Patrice, come here, come here.  I got to tell everyone what happened at home.  I'm the eyes of this thing.  So they're like a bus length apart.  Patrice, it's so obvious Patrice is hailing the cab. 
[00:35:00]  The guy slows down, keeps looking at Patrice, not sure what to do.  He's thinking, well, I need a fare today.  Then he looks ahead and sees Anthony, and he speeds up and picks up Anthony!  Unbelievable!  One for Anthony!  One for me!  None for Patrice!  One for the Nazi!  All right, let's get back.  I've got up a bitch nigga to pick up a fucking Nazi in this street!  One for the Nazi!  One for the Nazi!  All right.  All right, nigga, go and get a cab.  Let's see how this goes next. 
[00:35:30]  Nazi one, shwuggy zero.  All right, here comes another cab.  Here comes another cab.  Start hailing at the same time, guys.  All right, here's the cab.  He's slowing down.  And he has picked up Patrice.  Yeah.  Damn it.  Talk to the brother.  I thought he was going to pass him.  I thought he was going to pass him.  Thanks for stopping, man.  Appreciate that.  Listen, there's a Nazi that needs a cab right there.  No picking up.  No picking up Nazi.  All right.  All right.  Two brothers, too.  We're tied.  We're tied.  Two black guys.  All right, we're tied. 
[00:36:00]  Shwuggy one, Nazi one.  All right, best of seven.  Here comes another cab.  Oh, my God.  The cab sped by both of you all.  He didn't want either.  I had my mic up, too.  I had my mic up.  That might do it.  Hey, I need a cab.  He passed both of you.  This guy's turning.  Here we go.  All right, here comes another cab.  You guys got to, like, hail the cab at the exact same time.  All right, their arms are up.  We got Patrice.  We got Anthony. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, look at that.  That's two.  Damn it.  Two to one.  Two to one.  Damn it.  Two to one.  Hey, no.  Danny Glover.  This is called Danny Glover.  This is all Danny Glover's fault.  Where's a Nazi supposed to get a cab?  All right, Shwuggy two, Nazi one.  And you got to get a little closer.  You're a little too far away now.  A little further.  A little further.  All right, here we go.  All right, here we go.  Right there.  That's good.  Stand in the street, Anthony, like you really need it.  I'm going to be kind of like.  All right. 
[00:37:00]  All right.  When the light changes, we got a couple of cabs coming up.  Oh, here comes one.  All right, here comes one.  Let's see what happens.  And.  Oh, man.  Now it's a runaway.  Now.  Well.  Well.  The cab is kind of in the middle.  Ask the cabbie who he wants to pick up.  He doesn't know what to do.  Wait.  Wait.  Now he's pushing toward Anthony.  Who do you want to pick up, sir?  Whoever comes in the first door.  Yeah.  I need the cab, man.  Is it the nigger or the Nazi?  Whoever comes first door. 
[00:37:30]  Whoever comes first door.  You kind of hedged your bet.  Nah, he.  Let me tell you something.  This gentleman hedged his bet and pulled right between both of us.  What is that?  A tie?  And then he kind of pushed toward Anthony.  I don't know.  It's.  Patrice has two, right?  I got one.  I say.  And that's a tie.  I don't know.  He started.  He started pushing past Patrice.  He really did slowly start passing Patrice.  Well, you might have to give it to the Nazi.  Two.  If I'm the official judge.  I think it's two. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  And my helpers here are saying thumbs up to the Nazi.  He made an excuse that he was like.  Whichever.  He was ready to pick up Patrice.  Then he saw you.  Then he hedged his bet.  But then he started inching toward you because I think he didn't want to get in trouble.  This is the tiebreaker, right?  We're going to seven, though.  Best of seven.  We got two for the Shwoogie and two for the Nazi.  All right.  All right.  We're waiting for the next cab.  Outside XM Satellite Radio.  This guy.  You're trying to figure out what's going on?  You figured it out finally?  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  Here's another cab. 
[00:38:30]  I don't think.  No, he's got people.  He's got people.  Oh, he's got people in there.  All right.  We're waiting.  Two for the Shwoogie.  Two for the Nazi.  Patrice is loving this.  And you've got to be a little more aggressive because.  You've got to be aggressive.  And you've got to.  Anthony, move closer a little bit.  There you go.  Right about there.  And get in the street a bit.  There you go.  This is definitely fair.  You've got to be trying to get the cab, Anthony.  He is.  He is.  It's two to two.  It's two to two.  All right.  Wait for the bus to pass. 
[00:39:00]  Wait for the bus.  Game off.  It's two to two.  It's two to two.  It's two to two.  Two cabs are pissed.  Two to two.  To pick up the Nazi.  Danny Glover is going to be pissed if I win this.  Where's Danny Glover in this bitch?  Hold on.  We're waiting for the bus to pass.  Hold on.  All right.  There it goes.  Hold on.  Let this cab go by because they're letting people out.  They're letting people out.  We've got to keep this fair. 
[00:39:30]  Let them go.  Let them go.  All right, Anthony.  Get back in the street.  All right.  Game back on.  Game on.  Will the cabbie pick up a shwibby or a Nazi?  Put my mic down.  All right.  We're waiting for a cab.  Don't see nothing.  Now, the light's red.  When it turns green, we'll get a few people, a few cabs driving.  Yeah.  I cannot believe it's two up. 
[00:40:00]  It is two up.  God damn, another bus turning over here.  You better not be stopping.  Oh, I'm trying to catch a cab.  She's trying to catch a cab, sir.  It's a little tough.  Hey, what the hell is this guy doing?  All right.  Hold on with the bus.  Get this bus out of here.  You're ruining our bit.  They're letting someone out.  Letting people off.  All right.  That's all right.  God damn public transportation.  That's all right.  We're killing time anyway.  That's good.  If you're just tuning in, we're trying to see if a cab will stop for a shwuggie or a 
[00:40:30]  Nazi.  People are very threatened by Patrice.  You look a little threatening like that.  You put your game face on, man.  You like, you start grabbing yourself and, hey, Patrice, Monster House on the side of this  bus.  I was just telling you about the movie during the break.  Let's see that shit.  The 3D one.  The 3D action.  It's not bad.  All right.  After this bus passes, we'll get back to the game.  The bus driver is shaking her head at me.  How you doing?  Well, find out.  Find out.  Why is she shaking her head?  How you doing?  Excuse me, ma'am.  Is there a problem? 
[00:41:00]  You don't appreciate it?  No, she doesn't.  She's not happy.  I'll read the thing.  She's not happy what you just saw.  No.  All right.  Game on.  Here comes the cab.  Game on.  Here it comes.  Put the mic down.  Go in.  Start hailing.  All right.  Cabby's coming up.  Cabby's coming up.  He's speed.  Another one that's kind of in the middle.  Patrice, what do you think?  Patrice, what do you think?  He was going.  He got me. 
[00:41:30]  He wanted me.  He was going.  Oh, he wanted me.  He was going.  And then he thought the...  He was going.  He was fucking taking a Nazi.  Totally taking the Nazi.  He looked like a Nazi.  Did you see him?  Wait, I'm going to the judges.  Nazi or Swoogie?  Nazi.  That was so Nazi.  That was so Nazi.  One more.  I'm going to pull it down.  I'm going to pull this out with niggas.  Wow.  You better pull this out.  Nice.  You better pull this out, man.  All right.  Hold on.  Oh, what a comeback.  Fuck.  Wow.  What a comeback the Reich is making.  Patrice just saw a girl with huge tits, and now he doesn't know where he is. 
[00:42:00]  Patrice.  Stay in the game.  Stay in the game.  I'm pulling a Jesse Owens on you, motherfucker.  You better.  All right.  Hold on.  As soon as this bus passes, game back on.  It is three for the Nazi, two for the Swoogie.  What a comeback.  The Nazis are making.  No.  Ant needs one more, and he takes out the Swoogie.  I need one more, Cam.  And the Nazis will win.  All right.  Here comes the Cam.  Get in there, Ant.  My money's on Ant. 
[00:42:30]  Cam is making the left onto 57th Street.  Here he goes.  He is.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Thanks, man.  We're on.  Damn.  We're going to game seven.  It's going right to game seven.  All right.  Hold on.  Don't yell yet.  I am in the street.  Hold on.  Let's set this up.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Get in the street.  All right.  Hold on.  Here we go.  Jesse Owens.  Wait.  Don't.  Don't.  Don't.  Don't.  Don't.  Don't.  Don't.  Don't.  Don't.  Don't.  Hold on.  Let's set it up.  So here we go. 
[00:43:00]  The Shwoogie's got three.  The Nazis got three.  Wait.  Ready?  Okay.  Ready?  Game on the line.  Okay.  You stand there.  Yeah.  I'm going to come out and wave it before you.  We're going to catch you.  You're going to already be waving, and I'm going to run up, and I'm going to wave to get  right ahead of you.  Okay.  Ready?  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  Well, maybe you guys should start from this doorway and go to your spot.  And then go run.  We run to the spot.  That's exactly it.  Run to the spot at the same time.  Come here, and then.  Okay.  All right.  You go over there where you were. 
[00:43:30]  I go where I was.  Absolutely.  We both, as we're both hailing.  Absolutely.  And.  Okay.  Yeah.  You go straight this way.  Yeah.  Make sure it's.  Okay.  Plenty of cabs.  Plenty of cabs.  Okay.  See that one right here.  You say go, Obi.  You say go.  Right there.  See him?  All right.  Hold on.  See that cab?  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  When that light turns green, and he's right up front.  Wait, man.  So we get a green light like a drag race.  Yeah.  It's like a drag race.  When that light turns green, game on.  Game on.  Game on.  Shwuggy versus the Nazi.  It's 3-3.  Who gets a cab? 
[00:44:00]  Which is bad for Patrice, because that means three of them passed you by.  For a Nazi.  A Nazi.  So you.  A fucking Nazi got three cabs.  Who gets passed up?  The people that were enslaved for so many years, or the people that killed six million Jews?  You've already lost, man.  Fuck.  You've already lost.  What about this cab turning?  You may have a point.  As soon as that light turns green.  Light turns green.  Game on.  Game on.  All right.  Okay.  You've got to put the mics down.  Yeah, mics down when the light turns green.  Yeah, yeah.  Sam, get this.  This is for the title right here.  Here it is. 
[00:44:30]  Lights turning green any second now.  And then we'll step out.  And give our, uh, a little hail.  Game on!  Wait till he moves a little.  Wait till he moves.  Oh, shit.  He's turning.  Oh, he just, no.  He just grabbed somebody.  Oh, he did.  And a shwoogie at that, by the way.  All right.  Good.  I'm due.  All right.  Right behind.  Right behind that cab.  As soon as he takes off.  Can't be two cabs in a row picking up black people.  Oh, yeah.  That would be, uh.  It's got to be a Nazi sympathizer driving one of these. 
[00:45:00]  That's like the dealer getting three tins.  Yeah.  Go!  Go!  Game on!  Go!  Nazi versus the shwoogie.  The cab!  Oh, damn!  The Nazi!  Damn!  Thank you, sir.  Thank you for picking up a Nazi before an African American.  Oh, Patrice.  Did you realize that, sir?  I didn't know that.  You didn't know that?  You didn't see him with the gold chains and everything?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, gold chain or silver chain.  Did you notice I'm wearing a German Nazi war helmet and I gave you the Nazi salute as a hail? 
[00:45:30]  Did you see me first?  Oh, and there he goes.  Did you see me first?  Ask him.  Ask him.  I need a motherfucking cab!  The Nazis win!  Yeah!  Oh, my God.  Oh, is that not right?  Patrice, that is not right.  Wow.  So, wait.  What happened?  What did the guy say?  This motherfucking...  This motherfucker...  He said he didn't see Patrice. 
[00:46:00]  Patrice came bolting out.  He didn't see a 500-pound nigga with jewelry on?  Right.  And a mic!  And a mic.  He didn't see it.  These guys have been influenced, by the way, because what I noticed every time, they're  stopping sort of in the middle, like they're confused, and then they inch up toward Anthony.  And then they inch up toward the Nazi.  Just to get, like...  Just in case...  Just to get past you.  Right, just in case...  Unbelievable.  There is a problem in this city.  You mother...  Fuck.  I thought Danny Glover was full of shit. 
[00:46:30]  The third right gets a cab?  The third right gets a cab before a black guy.  Are you fucking serious?  This city is fucked up.  Are you fucking serious?  Best out of seven.  That was amazing.  Oh, shit.  Oh, Patrice.  I was sure I was going to win that.  Good job.  I was sure you were going to win it.  That's ridiculous.  You pulled away.  You did...  I had a comeback.  The fucking third right pulled away.  And it's good because with the seventh one, we did it completely even, where we both  came out at the same time, gave our little salutes and hails, and he came right to me. 
[00:47:00]  Right to the Nazi.  Oh, my God.  Oh, the injustice.  That's fucking despicable shit.  Did you see that?  Did you fucking see that?  Despicable.  Holy shit.  ONA's 20th anniversary retrospective.  Hey, it's Gary Wright, and you're listening to a bit that I made famous.  It's Dreamweaver on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Ant used to pick up a little CB horse. 
[00:47:30]  This was...  Come on, man.  Remember the big CB radio craze?  Of course.  I was like in my early teens, and it was a way to get girls, you know?  Yeah.  Okay.  Um, Breaker, Breaker 1-9.  Go ahead, good buddy.  Yeah.  Um, Breaker for a radio check.  You're coming in 4x4, good buddy. 
[00:48:00]  Thank you.  And then you're sitting there like, yeah, what else can I say?  Come back.  I'm 10, 10, 10-8 on the side, waiting for you, good buddy.  There.  Because I didn't drive, so what was the use?  You're just sitting in there.  It can't be like, you know...  I'm double nickels all the way.  Looking out for the Smokies.  Yeah.  Oh, look at that.  We got some pretty seat covers here today.  Down the old blacktop. 
[00:48:30]  Keep her between the ditches.  Good buddy.  Yeah.  Well, all right.  I did that.  What else can I say?  Hmm.  I'm just on the CB.  Oh.  I gotta explain this.  This just never...  Explaining never works on this show, does it?  I was living in California at the time, and I was very equestrian.  I had a horse, and I used to ride, and my handle, because I ran a rent string. 
[00:49:00]  This guy I knew had a rent string, so you used to take these Marines from Camp Pendleton  that wanted to be a cowboy for the weekend, and guide them up in the hill.  So I was like the guide.  And I'd take them up there, and then go back down the hill, and get the next batch, and  bring them up.  And so I was the wrangler with you.  Hey, good buddy.  You got the wrangler.  Good buddy. 
[00:49:30]  The foot wrangler.  Ah, shut up.  What was your handle?  Diamond dust.  Diamond dust?  Fag!  That's worse than...  What's diamond dust?  That's worse than butt wrangler?  It wasn't butt wrangler.  It was the wrangler.  Because a wrangler was a guy on a horse that got together the livestock.  Diamond dust? 
[00:50:00]  I don't know.  Hey, you got the diamond dust.  Hello, diamond dust.  Butt plug, you out there?  Good buddy?  Go ahead with your little cute story.  What?  Got your ears on?  Ah!  This here's a rubber duck.  A rubber duck, won't you?  Big fan, come on.  You shake the trees, I'll rake the leaves, good buddy.  For sure, for sure.  Oh, God.  It's clean.  Clear the flag tank.  Oh, dude.  I'm kidding.  The Big Ten's water.  Shut this off. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, we definitely got the front door, good buddy.  Mercy, thanks a lot.  We got us a convoy.  We got us a convoy.  I was a kid looking for chicks.  Were you in a roller skate?  Hey, there's a chick in a roller skate.  Uh-oh.  All right.  Hey, take her down to Double Nickels up by the interstate, good buddy.  We got a Kojak with a Kodak.  Good buddy taking pictures, giving away invitations.  I'll be back, I gotta go 10-100. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you see any Tijuana taxis out there?  We got us a Tijuana taxi.  Whoa, I just got passed by a crazy man on a crotch rocket.  You better watch out for the Smokies.  All right, come on, everybody.  All right, all right.  Meet you up at the Chokin' Puke. 
[00:51:30]  All right, the Wrangler.  Well, explain the rest of your story.  So then there was this girl that I used to communicate with on the Citizens Band.  And her handle was Dreamweaver.  You dick.  Dreamweaver.  Dreamweaver, this is the Wrangler.  You got your ears on?  And she sounded hot. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  So I invited her down to ride horses.  It's a key, ladies and gentlemen.  She sounded hot.  What do you look like, Ant?  Shut up!  All right, go ahead.  So I was all excited for my little date, and I saddled up my horse and the other horse and  kind of shut up.  I kind of shut up.  Dreamweaver.  I'll meet you down at the stable at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. 
[00:52:30]  This is the Wrangler over and out.  Dreamweaver.  So I'm all psyched.  You're an ass, man.  I believe we can't.  So, all right.  So I saddle up my horse, and I spend time, you know, brushing the horses, making sure they  look all good and everything.  And then I saddle up the other horse, and I take the reins and put her on the saddle horn,  and I'm kind of trailering the other horse, you know, down to meet her by the riverbed 
[00:53:00]  where we were going to ride.  Well, she comes walking up, and I see kind of in the distance, and I'm like, okay, that  must be her.  All right, now, wait, wait.  Now, you did say that you had the 10 and everything, and you were hoping to score in the woods,  right?  Yeah, yeah.  I had packed, like, a whole thing.  Saddlebags were all packed up with a couple of beers, and I had bed rolls.  And a tent, just in case things went well, because we had a bunch of hills to ride up  in and stuff. 
[00:53:30]  I'm going to camp out with my Dreamweaver.  Dreamweaver, tell your mom you're going to be spending the night, Dreamweaver.  Tell her you're at a friend's house, because we're going to camp out.  This is the Wrangler.  Over and out.  I'm 10-10-10-8.  On the side, Dreamweaver.  Looking forward to my little date.  Yeah.  Well, she comes up.  Even before I was gravely disappointed, the horse that had a carrier looked pissed. 
[00:54:00]  I wasn't sure if I should take the saddle off of the horse, put it on her, and let the  horse ride her.  Dreamweaver.  She was huge.  Dreamweaver, I believe you can get me through my life.  All right.  Yes, I was gravely disappointed.  Dreamweaver.  I believe we can get the horse and ride. 
[00:54:30]  So, Dreamweaver was a big...  So, she's like, are you a Wrangler?  Yes.  Please don't be Dreamweaver.  I'm Dreamweaver.  All right, let's go for a ride.  So, we went, like, up and down the riverbed for about an hour.  I was like, oh, look at the time.  Here I had, like, bedrolls on the back of this thing.  It was like, I was Paw Ingles going up to Walnut Grove. 
[00:55:00]  I was going to go over the river for a week to go get supplies for the family.  I mean, I had this thing packed out, like a pack mule.  You were ready to rock.  I was like a prospector.  I had crap hanging off the horses.  Oh, look at the time.  You were ready to rock.  Oh, ready to rock.  Good Dreamweaver.  I had firearms.  I was going to hunt her food.  Then I realized, looking at her, I'd need to beg a moose.  So, you know, we used to hunt.  We'd hunt little rabbits and stuff.  Your feet and the heart would be, forget about it. 
[00:55:30]  Gee, okay.  No, there's not many bison left on the plane.  I could live off your thigh for a couple of weeks.  I can't breathe.  Oh, it was horrid.  I was so disappointed because she's talking that she, you know, oh, yeah.  I look like Tatum O'Neill.  Yeah, sure you do.  Great.  So, I let her, you know, I let her off and she rode off into the distance. 
[00:56:00]  You didn't do the drive-by?  How are you going to do a drive-by on horseback?  Well, I'm the only guy with two horses, one empty.  Are you a wrangler?  No.  You should have.  No, just looking for another girl.  You should have tried to, like, meet her in town or something.  Did the drive-by.  The whole thing was riding up like Clint friggin' Eastwood, dude.  I understand that.  I had the whole look.  You got to remember something.  I'm a kid.  I'm, like, maybe 13 years old.  And this was mid-70s. 
[00:56:30]  I had cowboy attire on.  Believe me.  This was in San Juan Capistrano, California.  A very equestrian town.  Used to ride.  This was what we did, you know?  And I'm like, I had firearms on me.  I swear to God, I had a pistol just in case I had to fight for her honor for any bandoleros.  Meanwhile, they'd have been, you keep her.  Leave no honor.  Maybe she could pull the wagon. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, man.  But this was like, I was so pumped up for this, and so was she.  Pumped up.  But, yeah, it was very disappointing.  But to bring it all back to the beginning of this story,  she was a girl.  All right.  I haven't laughed that hard in a while.  My eyes are tearing.  This song brings back memories every time I hear it.  I got to tell you, to this day, when I hear Dreamweaver,  I think of the whole day how happy I was and psyched 
[00:57:30]  and how disappointed I was riding back to the ranch that day.  Oh, that's funny.  All right.  Very good story, Ann.  Thank you.  Well, thank you.  O-O-O-O-O-O-N-A's 20th anniversary retrospective.  Retrospective.  It's called The Baby Bird.  It's not gay, Pat.  Pat.  You are the mommy bird coming back to feed the baby bird.  Feed your young.  The baby's hungry.  Pat, just destroy it.  God.  Oh, my God.  I was going to destroy him.  Please say that before you do it.  Pat, just destroy his face, man. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  This is really, really bad.  He's got that look on his face like those guys in the 80s  that were about to fight Tyson.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Inevitable loss.  Pat, how are you?  Uh, it's getting real close.  All right.  It's getting real close.  The suspense.  All the cameras out.  We've never had more people in the studio, by the way.  There's got to be about 30 people in here.  At least.  And what he's doing, Ray, DiMaggio-esque.  This is like the 56-game hitting streak.  Yeah.  Yeah.  23 shots.  This will never be broken. 
[00:58:30]  Hey, someone is saying, please send her the PalTalk camera.  We got it.  Uh, I got mine done.  All right.  No, no, mine's fine.  Uh-oh.  It's PalTalk 2.  All right.  That somebody's in the way of, or something like that.  I guess it's the camera guy.  What shot is that?  The left.  74.  Oh, he's going for more.  He's going for 75.  Everyone's got to pretty much keep their position so the cameras and everybody can see.  Yeah, that's fine.  People are calling from all over America.  They've been puking all over the place. 
[00:59:00]  In just about every city in America.  And in Canada, thanks to XM.  He's just drinking now.  He's up to 77.  Uh-oh.  Here we go.  Here it goes.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  The baby bird is going down.  The baby bird is happening.  The baby bird is happening.  I can't speak.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  No.  Oh, my God.  No.  Oh, my God. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[01:00:00]  I almost wet myself.  I swear to you.  I'm laughing so hard.  We lost Jimmy.  He's laughing so hard.  He went into the corner.  A thunderous round of applause.  Down goes Pat.  Down goes Pat.  He's wearing puke blackface. 
[01:00:30]  That was the greatest moment in radio history, period.  It's impossible to top that.  That's impossible.  Trust me on that.  How can you top that?  Trust me on that.  How can that be topped?  We are announcing our retirement right now because that is it.  How can that be topped?  Wow.  Joe.  That can't be topped.  That was the craziest thing I've ever seen in my life.  That was insane.  That was insane.  Can you believe you were watching that as it was happening?  I cannot believe I saw that.  Tune in for ONA Unmasked today live at 4 p.m. on the East, 1 p.m. on the West. 
[01:01:00]  But a live O.B. and Anthony show is coming up next.  The East, 1 p.m. on the East, 1 p.m. on the East. 
[01:01:30]  The East, 1 p.m. on the East. 
[01:02:00]  The East, 1 p.m. on the East. 
[01:02:30]  The East, 1 p.m. on the East. 
[01:03:00]  The East, 1 p.m. on the East. 
[01:03:30]  Thank you. 
[01:04:00]  Thank you. 
[01:04:30]  For real radio, a new hope begins to rise.  Opie and Anthony are radio shock jocks known for setting up outrageous stunts.  People sure are listening.  Two Long Island natives who together would one day change the world as broadcasting's  greatest duo.  Opie!  Opie!  Oh my God!  It was beautiful! 
[01:05:00]  After 20 years, these children of the 80s have arrived.  A hugely popular radio show is not just in New York anymore.  Opie and Anthony show.  We're out of show on the road.  Through 55-gallon drums and whiffle ball bats.  You push it in until you're comfortable.  From mayors to mayor.  It was an April Fool's pulse by two radio disc jockeys.  Bottle rockets and brow bombings.  And wieners and pigs.  Opie and Anthony got their hands on the photo and tweeted it.  Two men that have taken a box of cocks further than any. 
[01:05:30]  Well, these people will definitely stop.  Guaranteed.  Lift up the...  They've met friends along the way.  Jim Norton.  I have a raging hard-on right now.  Can I please put my dick in your donuts?  And through fines, scandals, suspensions, cancellations, and terminations, it's the one show that remains unscathed.  Striking fear into the hearts of management everywhere, 
[01:06:00]  comes a radio show that after 20 years remains above all else.  Real.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning, everyone.  Hello.  Loving this late start.  That's right.  And it's fucking...  Oh, hi, Anthony.  How are you?  Hi, Opie.  How's your gut?  Good. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Anthony had the old Rod Stewart syndrome.  Nah, the old George Brett.  Technically speaking, I probably could have made it in, but it was one of those...  Like...  Sounds like a rusty hinge.  Down the lower gut.  Going to the bathroom.  Ruining some underwear.  Yeah.  You missed all the controversy yesterday.  Controversy?  Yeah, we have posters, and Sam is trying to make it a limited edition, which is the dumbest 
[01:07:00]  thing I've ever heard in my life.  And I heard you on the pre-show.  Yeah.  I love that I get to voice my concerns after your pre-show.  Yeah.  People were fighting good, and you were hanging in there.  All right.  But here's the thing.  It's special if the person has it.  Right.  They don't give a fuck if other people have it.  Uh-huh.  But it's like a...  Like, if you're in your home, right? 
[01:07:30]  Yes.  And you sent away, or we could give you a free poster.  You're hanging the poster.  You're not thinking that it's a limited edition, or there's only 350 of these things.  You're like, wow, this is pretty special.  I got one of those posters.  No, that's not true.  And Jim, you know that's not true either.  If you have something that you know is limited, you think we're more special.  We're not a limited edition type of show.  Well, my middle name is Rare Item.  Oh.  Jim Rare Item Norton.  Yes.  People are going to be stuffing envelopes for the rest of the year.  First of all, the posters.  Free posters for everybody. 
[01:08:00]  We need to buy posters for everybody.  Can you find it?  And then that sets up this whole thing where now everybody thinks that it's like...  Everybody gets a poster.  You should just be able to get a free poster.  Why not?  Why not?  It's free.  It's free.  People love free stuff.  It's an okay poster.  I almost said nice poster.  It's an okay poster.  What's wrong with the poster?  Well, we've done 20 years of radio, and most of the pictures are from the last four years.  There's nothing from AAF there or NAW?  No AAF. 
[01:08:30]  No BAB.  No BAB, right.  No NAW, really.  What's the first picture of you guys together?  Oh, man.  That's had to be BAB somewhere.  No, but I've never seen it.  Yeah, there's one of Anthony feeding a goat.  Oh, right.  I used to have live animals on my radio show.  We had a goat that was fucking heading us in the balls all night long.  And shit all over the floor.  Yeah, I got that one.  And I think Buckman was mad because something with his coffee cup.  Wasn't there a piece of goat shit in his coffee mug or something?  Were you on full time at that point or no? 
[01:09:00]  No.  He was just coming in.  Yeah, he was just coming in at all AAF.  And I would bring animals into the studio.  And I was there one night.  Yeah.  And 7-Eleven clerks.  Well, I would have people kidnap people for tickets.  Do you know how mad legal it would get this day and AAF?  That's real.  Go out and kidnap a 7-Eleven worker and bring them here.  That was one of my best.  And they did it.  And the lady came in.  She didn't speak English.  She didn't know what the hell was going on.  She didn't know what was going on.  I think it might have been for Grateful Dead tickets. 
[01:09:30]  She didn't know what was going on.  She was petrified.  How many pictures from the old days, Sam Roberts?  Meaning WNEW?  Yeah.  Do newspaper headlines count?  Oh, my God.  I can actually look at these and tell you what day of the week.  That was Wednesday.  There's pictures from like a week ago, two weeks ago.  The whole spectrum of 20 years.  You wear the same clothes in every picture. 
[01:10:00]  I got to start trying again to get some of this stuff done properly.  Instead of saying, yeah, yeah, yeah, a lot.  There are some pre-merger photos.  Let me see the poster.  Careful.  They have two photos of you from the picture.  Careful.  And why is this one ripped?  That's not one of the limited editions.  That's an extra one.  It's not a limited edition poster.  Everyone gets posters.  Let's see.  Let's see.  So far, I don't see. 
[01:10:30]  Wow.  Okay.  Officially, there's no pictures from N.E.W.  Wow.  Well, no, that's not true.  Which one?  Look at the newspaper headlines.  The newspaper headlines.  But that was after N.E.W.  Technically, the photo in the newspaper.  Good point.  All right.  All right.  He's taking N.E.W.  A picture of a picture.  Right.  And there's a little show we did called Jay Leno.  That should have probably been on here. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, I remember that.  There's a great photo of you guys on Letterman's couch together, which is a great shot.  Right.  They should have probably had a Leno, too, just because it's a different show.  Maybe a Fallon.  Maybe Fallon.  He's kind of hot right now.  I don't know.  Is he?  He's kind of hot.  What's he doing these days?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, it's celebrating 20 years of Opie and Anthony with pictures that are about four  to five years old.  Oh.  That's good.  Oh.  I'm very, very flimsy.  Flimsy paper.  If you get one of these at Caroline's today, be very careful with it. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, my God.  That's good if you've got mud on your feet and don't want to get it on the floor of your  car.  You just lay them down in the well.  Right.  Yeah.  The other thing that SiriusXM fucked up was we went on their, we got on their home page.  Yeah.  And there's a million pictures they could have chose, but they decided to pick a picture  where Anthony's not being represented.  Oh, no.  It might have been from yesterday.  They might have fixed it finally, maybe.  Did they? 
[01:12:00]  It was me, Jimmy, Ricky Gervais, Ron Bainton, and Louis C.K.  Oh, that one.  Yeah, Anthony was there.  I was like, what are they doing?  No, Anthony.  Jesus.  No, Anthony.  There's a million pictures of us together.  And they chose that one.  And I know why, because they're all about big names.  Yeah.  Exactly.  They're all about big names.  So they're like, well, who gives a fuck Anson on this picture?  We got some big names in this picture.  They love their celebrities.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  It was a tweet that went out yesterday.  Did they fix it?  I think it was a blog post.  So I'm looking at the blog.  A blog?  A blog. 
[01:12:30]  A blog.  B-L-A-U-W-G.  A closet.  A blog.  And you also say Otto wrong.  I've been hearing that.  How do you say it?  Otto.  Otto.  Otto.  Otto.  Like A-U-T-O.  But that's, you know, when I would see him, that's how it always addresses him.  I love you, though.  Otto.  Otto.  Otto.  I do love you, though.  His friend Roger used to say it like that.  Yeah.  Otto.  Otto.  Otto.  Otto.  Maybe they got rid of it because it was quite the embarrassment.  That's ridiculous.  And a lot of people.  I think they did get rid of it.  Really?  Well, let me see.  I think I retweeted, so maybe it's still on my timeline. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, you're getting retweeted?  Retweeted?  Oh, yeah.  Without comment, by the way.  Just waiting for the listeners to figure it out.  Waiting for them to pick up on it?  Yeah.  I like to sit back and then discuss all the issues instead of fixing them on the spot.  You mean you like to let the accident happen and then talk about where everybody went wrong?  Talk about it.  Instead of preventing it or anything.  There it is.  There's the picture.  There it is.  This week on demand, 20 years of Opie and Anthony.  And the picture they use for the 20 years of Opie and Anthony is Jim Norton, left to right,  Ricky Gervais, Ron Bennington, Louis C.K., and I'm in the background on the right. 
[01:13:30]  It really is a terrible representation.  I'm not even close to being there.  Yeah, you're not even front and center.  Front and center.  I'm like an afterthought, like I'm a fan that jumped in at the last second.  That's the brilliance of this place.  That really is bad.  It's a great shot for us.  It's a really bad shot for representing what the show is.  Oh, my God.  And I saw the problem with the poster.  I was just like, all right, let it happen.  Let it happen.  Although I did say there's a picture of the WOW sticker, the Times Square billboard. 
[01:14:00]  I did tell them to add that to the poster.  It was not added.  I don't know why.  Why don't we go to Madison Square Garden?  We do.  That was a big one.  Why not a shot of the Madison Square Garden?  We got that one.  Oh, you do?  Okay.  You know what?  We got that one.  Here we go.  That was happy.  But that doesn't even look like it's on the Madison Square Garden.  It just looks like the picture.  Yeah.  It looks like a tall picture.  You have no idea that that's draped over the entire side of Madison Square Garden. 
[01:14:30]  That's when XM was all in with taking care of us.  You see the photo of him?  Before the merger.  In his Renaissance gear?  Yes.  That's from Boston.  That was fun.  That's fun.  By the way, sorry, that's pre-  That's N.E.W.  Really?  That was why I went with Eastside Dave.  Okay.  Oh, did you?  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a big XM logo in there.  Oh.  I thought that's when we went up in like-  Why only pictures from the last five years?  Sorry.  Why only pictures from the last five years?  Let's redo the poster. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, no.  Do we have time?  Yeah, let's redo the poster.  By tonight.  Let's redo it real quick.  By this afternoon.  We'll hand out like little make good cards.  Rain checks?  Yeah, for the new posters that we're going to start making today.  How's that sound?  Is that good?  No, we're not going to give them rain checks.  We have posters.  We're going to do rain checks.  And you've got to sign these posters.  I ain't signing them.  Give me one.  I'm not signing anything.  Chip, you can't.  No, because-  How many do we have to sign?  How many are there?  500?  No, not 500.  It's more limited than that.  It's more limited than 500? 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, it's like 300.  No, it's not limited.  Everyone's getting a poster.  It's not limited.  I'm telling you right now.  We can't just send posters because people want them.  We're going to.  I like the idea.  If I have a show that's not sold out, we're giving away limited edition seats.  You will not be selling all seats.  Phil, jump on that.  A limited edition.  We're not a hoity-toity, limited edition type of show.  That's right.  If you want a poster, you get a poster, period.  What if we made a new poster to send to everybody? 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, go ahead.  I heard you talking about that as well.  This isn't even a special unmasked poster.  Well, not with that attitude, it's not.  It's just a poster from the last four years.  Someone went into a drawer somewhere.  It found some pictures.  A drawer and found a stack of pictures and said, ah, these are good enough.  All from the same roll of film.  Why use Google Image?  Yeah.  Why do that? 
[01:16:30]  Are you saying this is celebrating Opie and Anthony since 2010?  Yes.  Yes, it is.  Somewhere Don's having a heart attack.  Oh, Don.  A heart attack.  Let me say hi to Larry in Connecticut.  Larry is a good egg.  Larry.  Hey, good morning.  Good morning.  I just want to congratulate you to Greg and Ricky's show on 20 years.  Good luck, guys.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah.  Well, it's not even.  No.  According to the picture, I would say that it's Ron Bennington. 
[01:17:00]  And I would go with Louis C.K. celebrating 20 years of radio.  Yeah.  Yes.  They're kind of the front and center guys in that picture.  Well, people know.  It looks like Louis and Ricky are doing a show.  Because it looks like everyone knows Ron.  Oh, okay.  Right.  And they know Opie and they know I work here.  So it looks like Louis and Ricky are doing something.  And you guys just wanted to get in on the picture.  Hey, Louis and Ricky.  Yeah, yeah.  Who decides this stuff?  I think this one.  Does any of this go past Don's desk?  This blog post?  No.  No, this was not Don.  That's just the website.  Do they know who we are? 
[01:17:30]  Yes.  I think that at least one person over there.  I mean, a couple people are fans of the show.  They listen.  They think maybe I was Ricky Gervais or I was Louis C.K.  How could they?  How could they?  She said Gary Glitter.  I said yes.  I used to wear goatees and I was a bit chubby.  So maybe they're thinking Louis was me.  Oh.  They don't know what we look like, do they?  They know you guys.  That's pretty sad.  Not really.  Who does the blog? 
[01:18:00]  Blog.  The web team does.  Who's the web team?  Well, this was written by...  Because I'm happy.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  What happened?  Someone named Kyle wrote this.  All right.  So what do they do for the free posters?  Is there an email address set up?  No.  The only way you get the posters is if you go to Unmasked.  And if you're going to Unmasked, you already know you're going to Unmasked.  Oh, hell nah.  That's right.  I hell nah.  Hell nah.  Hell nah.  I hell nah.  And you guys won't even sign the posters for the Unmasked people yet.  What?  Let's see.  You can't sign, Chip. 
[01:18:30]  There's only a few.  Let's see.  I want to be special.  I want a free poster.  Everyone's going to get a free poster.  Don't you worry.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  And that's not special.  And now we deal with this.  Hi, who's this?  Good morning, guys.  This is Bobo.  Oh, boy.  Hi, Bobo.  Hey, how's everything going, guys?  First, I'd like to wish you guys happy 20 years.  Oh, you see.  I like his approach this time.  Very nice.  I wish you guys happy 20 years of giving us all great radio and making us laugh. 
[01:19:00]  I've never seen him laugh, by the way.  No, you've never laughed once in our presence.  You know that.  You look like the Manchurian candidate when you're in here.  Yeah.  Ben?  And I would also like to say that I'm calling in based on the suggestion that Ronnie B gave me.  I called in in response to what I was tweeting.  They were trying to get people, pair up people that didn't have a plus one. 
[01:19:30]  That sounds complicated.  What are you doing?  Well, that time I was trying to tweet that time.  I don't know.  I don't really know what you tweet.  You start over from the beginning.  And by that, I mean when the umbilical cord was wrapped, obviously, very tightly by your throat.  Bobo, I love you, but I blocked you a long time ago.  I had to.  Yeah.  I had to. 
[01:20:00]  So I don't even know what you've been tweeting.  Yeah, I haven't even looked at Twitter.  I don't love you, but I blocked you.  All right.  Well, anyway, here's what happened.  Oh.  The Twitter account for the Unmasked show, they have a Twitter account.  And they were trying to ask people to tweet if they want to be paired up with someone to fill the extra spots in case anyone didn't take anyone there plus one.  Right.  I don't think there's going to be any extra spots.  Plus, I would assume there's going to be a little wine outside Caroline's just in case. 
[01:20:30]  That shit usually happens.  And so why do I, why do I have the feeling he's going to be there anyway?  Oh, of course he is.  He's going to just figure this out.  He'll figure out how to get in.  He won't be there because of me.  He's very creative.  And then I hear Marion's yelling and screaming this morning.  Oh, she, she called the pre-show and she wouldn't even talk to me.  She just got on the phone.  I picked her up.  She said her piece and she hung up, which was probably a blessing.  But do we hear that?  What the fuck did she want?  Oh, I got a contact from her, too. 
[01:21:00]  Really?  Yes, I did.  From, I, I, it was from, uh, Marion.  Yeah.  What the fuck did she want?  We have the clip from the pre-show if you want it.  Bobo, good luck getting a ticket.  I don't know what to tell you, though.  All right.  Well, I'll, I'll be there and, uh, like, go ahead with that.  What?  And if it worked, if it works out fine, then that's fine with me.  But however, he's really, he's really subdued today.  We actually, we actually had a ticket laying around here. 
[01:21:30]  But, all right.  All right.  Bobo, I got to go.  Okay.  Well, I'll take the ticket.  If you, if you want to offer it, I'll gladly take it.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  We got to go.  I don't, you know, I wish I had a little more passion after all these years, but we really,  okay.  It was a nice talking to you.  And, um, maybe you'll get in tonight.  I, I mean, this ticket's just sitting here.  It's just laying around.  I hate to waste it.  Yeah.  Just sitting here like that.  All right, Bobo. 
[01:22:00]  It was good talking to you.  All right.  All right, Regina.  He's giving shout outs?  Who's Regina?  Who's Regina?  Who's she?  He's gone.  He's the fucking vacuum cleaner?  He was on, uh, he was on Ron and Fez yesterday and agreed.  Ron suggested this and Bobo agreed.  Good old Ron.  Yeah.  Ron suggested, uh, a sit down that before on massed that Ron, the old gang, which is  Jim, Opie, Anthony, Ron, and Bobo.  Right.  Sure.  All sit down to a nice lunch and figure out exactly what the problem is. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, that Ron suggested that to me.  Yes.  Why?  That's hilarious.  What a hunk of shit Ron is.  He's a troublemaker.  Yeah, because you know what happened?  Ron wouldn't show up for that abominable lunch.  Well, yeah, yeah.  Then, like, 30 seconds later, Ron goes, ah, I forgot.  I'm going to have to work when lunch is going on.  I'll be here.  All right, Bobo.  It'll just be you and ONA then.  Don't talk bad about Ronnie.  He's beloved.  He's the man. 
[01:23:00]  He is beloved.  Let's say hi to Tammy in Syracuse.  Tammy.  Hi there.  Hi.  I just want to call and congratulate you guys on being on the air for 20 years and never  actually saying anything funny.  That is a feat in and of itself.  Oh.  Oh, you're not a fan of the radio show?  Every morning, I ride to work with my husband.  He forces me to listen to you.  I want to throw myself on the highway.  Oh, God.  Do you know how happy that makes me?  Yes.  I'm very happy by this news. 
[01:23:30]  Exactly.  Your husband really runs a tight ship over there, and I like it.  You probably enjoy a good kitten video.  That's right.  What do you like, Tammy?  What makes you laugh?  What makes you laugh?  Why aren't you cleaning the toilet?  I bet your stewardesses on airplanes make you laugh.  You know what I think is really funny?  What?  I think that one bald guy is...  What's his name?  Jeff Norton.  I think he's funny.  You son of a bitch.  All right, Tammy.  Hold on now.  Go ahead.  Slow down.  You son of a bitch.  Let's not be harsh now.  Tammy's talking.  He's has some criticism for the show. 
[01:24:00]  Go ahead, Tammy.  He's very funny.  I think he's very funny.  Like, hysterically funny.  Thank you.  But just not on the show.  Oh, no.  Backhanded.  She roped me in.  She roped me in.  Oh, fuck.  You're not going to recover from that one.  She roped me in.  Tammy's on her side.  Tammy, I got to get a little gauge on what you find funny, though.  What entertains you?  Um, well, it's hard for me to say what entertains me, but I know what does not entertain me. 
[01:24:30]  No, no.  Fuck that.  Come on.  Something makes you laugh.  Name three comics that you like watching.  Comics, TV shows, whatever.  I like that Jim Norton guy.  No, enough of this.  Your stick is stupid.  Your stick is stupid.  What else?  What are the shows you watch and find funny?  Start there.  Um, shows I watch and, I got to say, I don't watch a lot of...  What about comics?  Comedians?  Who do you find funny?  It sounds to me like nothing's made you laugh in 20 years.  No, actually, I laugh a lot. 
[01:25:00]  Then tell us what you laugh at.  What do you find entertaining?  You couldn't not like this show.  The blonde, like, Chelsea Handler.  Is that her name?  Yeah, she's funny.  Uh-huh.  She's all right.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  What?  You should get her on your show.  She was on our show.  I've had her on.  A couple times, though.  That's right, madam.  Anything else?  That might have been the one day I laughed.  I did laugh one day.  Oh.  Um, you would remember if it's the only day you laughed, Miss.  It's like, it's like if you heard one song for a week straight, you'd remember it.  You would remember.  Right. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  No, I did.  Didn't I laugh one day?  Why are you raining on our parade?  You must be a joy for that husband of yours.  Because everybody who calls in is, like, snorkeling, you guys.  So I just wanted to...  Snorkeling.  I mean, I'm not telling...  Oh, my God.  You sound horrendous.  Your poor fucking husband.  Your poor husband has to drive around with an unfunny piece of shit bitch like you.  Radio show.  Oh, good.  But, you know, the beautiful thing is he gets to listen to the radio show.  Yes, that's true. 
[01:26:00]  He lays down the wall.  I respect that.  Good.  Good.  Start rattling those pots and pans.  Isn't it time for you to be cooking up some breakfast for your man?  See?  There you go.  Second laugh.  There you go.  You're laughing.  You're laughing now.  You're laughing now.  You're laughing now.  Anything else?  We've got to go and be radio stars now.  I've got nothing else.  You should take more pictures.  So next 20 years, you'll have a better poster.  All right.  She's not a liar.  Constructive criticism.  All right.  I like the constructive criticism.  That was good.  They are lazy around here. 
[01:26:30]  They're extremely lazy.  Thank you, Tammy.  You're welcome.  Now, I have this.  I told this from Marion.  Right.  I got this Facebook yesterday.  Hi, Jim.  Even though they don't want me and Diane there tomorrow, happy anniversary in the show and Diane love you.  Hey, Jim.  They are not being fair to Diane.  They are shitheads for doing this to us.  Is that a real post?  All lowercase.  No periods.  No commas.  Psychopathic.  It is literally, she types the way she talks. 
[01:27:00]  Yes.  Rambling.  Do you honestly think we would want Lady Di there, knowing the type of person she is,  especially when she gets a few in her?  Holy fuckaroni.  She'd make it all about herself.  Hi, how are you?  Hi, it's Lady Di.  Hi.  Oh, shut up.  All right.  You're not changing your tune on Lady Di, maybe?  Not?  Nope.  An ounce.  Do you want to hear what Marion said about you guys on the pre-show?  Yeah, sure.  Go ahead.  Right now, we go to Marion, the best friend of Lady Di. 
[01:27:30]  Hey, Sam.  How are you?  I'm good.  Marion, of course, from the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Let me tell you something about me and the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  I am very pissed off that Olsen and Anthony are letting me and not having me and Diane  here today at this.  I'm mad.  And I'm going to tell you something.  He's very, very, very upset.  Does she not...  I don't know what's going on with Bobo because Diane hasn't heard from him.  I don't know if he's allowed to go. 
[01:28:00]  But me and Diane have been a part of that show for 20 years.  No, you haven't.  And I think it's fucking wrong.  These are both assholes.  Bye, Sam.  That's it?  You hanging up?  She hung up.  That was it.  I don't think she's been with the show for 20 years.  But, I don't know.  I'm going to give that clip for sure to Olsen and Anthony today.  Wow.  That's crazy.  You guys are assholes.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Apparently.  What are you going to do? 
[01:28:30]  These people got to get lives, man.  It's time to go get a life.  This isn't about Marion and Lady Di.  Well, that's why the Bobo rule is in effect.  Yes.  Because it's not about other people.  For once, it might be about us.  Jesus Christ.  Because we only have an hour.  That was the whole thing.  We can't have any distractions.  Hushing her down?  Yeah.  Jeremy in Buffalo.  Hey.  Hi.  Hello.  Hey.  Hello. 
[01:29:00]  Hey, asshole.  Well, now you're leaving a mystery here.  It could be a lot of people.  You're on the radio.  Sam, it's for you.  Sam, it's for you.  The boss scolded you.  Go ahead, Jeremy.  I want to call Opion on his newly recent crutch.  Yeah.  You keep fucking saying every fucking day.  I think four goes here.  Figure it out.  Let's see. 
[01:29:30]  No, I thought it was a seven.  I think seven is here.  Fuck.  Damn it.  I'm trying to figure it out, sir.  This is a tough one today.  This is an Oku puzzle.  What were you saying?  Every fucking day you say figure it out.  Yeah, yeah.  We're going to fucking figure it out.  Let's see.  That's a cross-reference.  Five, five, five.  Okay.  Oh, it's a five.  What?  Well, I just wanted to call you out on your recent new crutch.  Okay, thanks.  Anything else?  You're welcome.  No, that's it.  Okay.  Hello, Jimmy.  All right.  All right.  Wow. 
[01:30:00]  If it's a harsh language, sir.  What's with the hate?  I don't know.  A lot of haterade being served today.  A lot of anger.  Oh, my God.  Because I'm happy.  Because I'm happy.  So when do these posters get signed?  We can start signing them now.  All right.  I'll figure it out.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Now I'm going to say it a thousand times, you dope.  Because I'm happy.  Yeah.  Saw you guys in the newspaper today, too. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, I, I, uh, well, there's an article online on us.  Oh.  And then the actual paper didn't think it was important enough to put the article in,  so they put a tiny little blurb in the middle of the paper.  Probably, if you look at a newspaper, the worst spot you can put anything.  Yeah.  It's like in the frigging margin.  It's just a, it's a tiny blurb about our unmasked.  Who did it?  Hinkley?  It's only a picture of me.  And so it's a picture of me when I was anorexic, when we were fired.  Like, that picture's like 12 years old now. 
[01:31:00]  Is it, is it?  Oh, God.  You didn't have that figured out.  Jimmy spilled his coffee all over him.  You, you fucking bitch.  I spilled my coffee.  Spilled my coffee.  I caught it, though.  Yeah, you did.  Sam, get this right here.  Oh, boy.  It's on his dick.  I don't sign with Sharpies anymore.  Oh.  What are you talking about? 
[01:31:30]  Liquid pens or nothing.  A regular pen?  A pen?  It's a liquid pens.  Liquid, the liquid pens.  I'll sign it.  Oh.  I don't know what they're called officially.  Why don't you just sign with a silver Sharpie?  I'm not signing with a, this is a very important poster.  Yeah, it's a limited item.  And we're going to be signing thousands of these in the coming weeks.  Oh, man.  So I want the proper.  We don't have any liquid pens.  What's the proper signing implement?  You better go and get them.  That's right.  We just sign with a Sharpie.  I'm not signing with a Sharpie.  He's asked for liquid pens before.  Mm-hmm.  Liquid pens will take a long time.  I forgot what they're called. 
[01:32:00]  They're like.  Because you can't just start stacking them on top of each other.  You've got to let them dry.  Yeah.  It's the most difficult.  Liquid pens and a fan.  Get a small fan to dry them.  And then we can lay them out down the hallway so they dry properly.  Yeah.  Hey, man.  You want a limited edition?  We've got to go all in with limited edition.  You don't sign limited edition shit with a Sharpie.  We tested the markers.  Because I'm happy.  This is.  What is.  It's a liquid pen, isn't it?  No. 
[01:32:30]  You idiot.  What is it?  What did you bring in?  A pen that ballpoint.  Ugh.  You idiot.  Who calls it a liquid pen?  He means a liquid marker.  I don't know what they're called.  They're like, um.  They're paint pens.  In space.  A rocket ship.  Upside down.  They're paint pens, I think they're called.  Paint pens?  Yeah.  You've got to push the point down for a while and let all the paint.  You can shake them.  It's like.  Look at that little fucking thing.  All right.  Yeah.  We'll send them out to grab them.  If you push down too hard, it goes.  Right.  Those are the worst.  Yeah.  And I hope you have extra posters because we're going to wreck a few by accident. 
[01:33:00]  With blobs of paint.  For the love of God, just please sign a Sharpie.  For the love of God.  Why does it always have to be a chore?  Because things need to be done right.  This is right.  It's a silver Sharpie.  We could get over the fact that there's pictures only from the last four years, but we're going  to sign them properly.  Yeah.  Give me that.  With paint pens.  Chip, you don't have to sign any.  You're not allowed to sign any.  With a regular pen?  Yeah.  With a regular paint.  Does Marion understand why she can't be there and Lady Di can't be there? 
[01:33:30]  Absolutely not.  Because they don't know how to keep their mouths shut.  They don't behave.  For the entire time, by the way.  Not a quick minute or whatever.  That happens at a live event.  They talk the entire time.  Hi!  Hi!  They'd be yelling from the back.  You want to fucking punch them?  You don't think they'd be listening?  Not for a minute.  No.  Yeah.  It's all about them.  Lady Di would be fucking sucking them down.  Meow! 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, I was an intern.  I was an intern.  Yeah, I was an intern.  Yeah, and then she thinks that was a real job.  Marion thinks it was a real opportunity.  Oh, my God.  It was a goof.  It was a radio bit.  It was a goof!  Oh, here comes Kenny.  I'm sure he heard about the liquid pen.  Oh, Kenny.  And he's going to get right on.  Kenny will set you straight.  What color, G-H?  I called Iraq, and he was so mad on the phone about it.  Why?  Why is he on the phone?  Where is he?  I called him, and he's like, no!  We're not sending someone out.  I said, nope.  Hope wants it.  Oh, then I'm not signing.  Oh, she's... 
[01:34:30]  Nope.  Please sign with a silver sharpie.  Sam's begging.  My autograph just got rare.  Oh, she's not signing.  Kenny, set him straight on the liquid...  What are they called?  Paint pens?  Paint pens.  No, I think there's something that needs to be brought to your attention.  Uh-oh.  More bullshit.  Sam, I just saw a tie on your desk.  What's that for?  A tie?  Hopefully what we really want it to be used for.  Hopefully for one final dress-up. 
[01:35:00]  So if I choose to wear it to unmasked, I can?  Oh, my God.  You should use it for auto-ironic asphyxiation.  What's asphyxiation?  When you kill your fucking self while jerking off.  Sam.  I like your explanation, but you said asphyxiation wrong.  Asphyxiation.  A fix is to stick something.  Yeah, that's when your a-ation is broken.  I meant well.  Sam, only management wears ties.  Well, I'm not going to wear the ties.  I was taught this many years ago by Brother Louise, because I made the mistake once of  walking in a radio station with a tie, and he said, what the fuck are you doing? 
[01:35:30]  Do not wear a tie.  All right.  Will you please?  I won't.  I'll wear whatever you want if you just sign the posters.  Get me a paint pen.  Paint pen.  And I'll probably be able to do about 20 today.  You need to do all today.  All right.  We'll get there.  Slowly but surely.  Why don't you have me sign your tie?  We've already been over this, Kenny.  All right.  Let me say hi to Jamie in Texas. 
[01:36:00]  Jamie.  Yeah, it's Jimmy.  Sorry.  I was going to explain why there's so much hatred this morning.  There's no hatred whatsoever, because I'm happy.  It's all about fun.  I've been singing happy.  Let's go.  Yeah.  What do you got?  Well, that's what you were saying earlier.  I'd say maybe because we come in late and immediately start bitching.  We didn't come in late.  It was a special time today.  We are bitching.  Yeah, maybe people didn't understand that.  We had a special start time today. 
[01:36:30]  It was a treat.  You got to listen to some of the last 20 years of greatness.  Oh, yeah.  Or the last couple of years.  Oh, yeah.  Making it look like it was 20 years of radio.  But that's good enough, right?  Yeah, yeah.  What was the oldest bit you played in that half hour?  Be honest.  How long ago?  Yeah, I've heard all that.  Was there any AEF stuff?  No.  No, there wasn't.  No.  Any W?  That I can't confirm.  No.  There was some of the... 
[01:37:00]  Was there anything pre-merger, at least?  There was some pre-merger stuff.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  That's good.  Pre-merger stuff.  So maybe stuff about nine years ago.  Baby Bird?  Huh?  All right.  All right.  All right.  Baby Bird.  You could have just thrown in a quick, you know, plug just to represent the...  Yeah, I mean, I'm sure we have a Demental World CD later in there somewhere.  Well, you could sign a poster with a Sharpie, but we all make choices.  Oh, boy.  Look how we turned that around.  Right.  People very mad at Marion. 
[01:37:30]  Good.  Good, as well they should be.  Ryan in Philly.  Ryan.  Hey, guys.  Congratulations, guys.  You're going to be 20 years off the bat.  So, with the way that Lady Di and Diane and Bobo, they're all part of the show.  No, no.  Did they ever attend a fucking staff meeting or budget, Bobo?  Oh, slow down.  We haven't done that in years.  I haven't been at a staff meeting in years.  I'd rather have a staff infection.  Okay.  Well, on their angle, then, I was in Studio 55 Gallon Grove Challenge. 
[01:38:00]  I got locked in my job at the Short Hills Mall when you bought that whole haram of fun.  So that I...  Hey, by that notion, I'm part of the show.  Where's my fucking album?  See?  There you go.  What about the homeless shopping spree, Sam?  Was that represented in that half-hour look back?  Not in the half-hour, but...  Maybe a little Ziggy's...  I gotta tell you guys, that was the funniest goddamn thing I'd ever seen in my life.  Of course it was.  I was 22 years old, and all you see is a whole bunch of these fucking slobs coming through.  A mall full of old, chosen people slamming gates and running for the fire doors. 
[01:38:30]  You would have thought the fucking Nazis came through.  Yeah, why do that again, right?  Why do that event again?  That's stupid.  Why would you do that again?  Considering we did four of them and there was not one problem.  Well, we could have done it in the basement of a Dwayne Reed, I think.  Costco.  That's what they wanted us to do.  It was a Costco.  Before they opened the doors to the public, by the way.  That was their wonderful idea.  Your mom's box.  Whoa. 
[01:39:00]  Not until October, so...  Thank you, Ryan.  Be good, guys.  All right.  All right.  So, can we eat food now, Sam?  Look what Eric brought you.  Oh, wow.  It's a pink slip.  It's an old one, though.  Oh, my God.  I like the smaller ones.  Those gotta be fresh and new.  Yeah, like this?  No.  No.  That's a Sharpie.  Sharpies are cheap.  Please sign with a Sharpie.  Oh.  I don't like...  This almost works.  Oh, look.  It's leaving some light parts. 
[01:39:30]  It's a little old, though.  What's it called?  Paint pens, right?  It's a brand new Sharpie.  Huh?  It's silver.  It's just like a paint pen.  No, we're not doing Sharpies.  I'm telling you right now, we're not doing Sharpies.  And let's get the email address set up for the people that aren't going to make it tonight  so they can get their free poster.  We don't have the posters to send.  Well, it's a pre-order.  We were already talking about who's going to pay for these posters.  Oh, boy.  There may be a sponsor logo on there.  What?  Oh, my God. 
[01:40:00]  Look, you want thousands of posters printed up.  Why are we here?  Steven Singer?  That name might have been thrown about.  Why the fuck are we...  I don't want...  I love the guy.  He's not going to be on our 20-year poster.  Well, then we can't print thousands for free.  Oh, my God.  They spent millions on Howard's birthday party.  We can't get posters.  They're doing $40 million worth of renovations on this floor alone.  Oh, man.  I went to the town hall meeting.  It was nice.  Oh. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah, but what...  I mean, it's posters, though.  It's not like...  You're holding the show hostage.  I am?  Until we get this poster thing done, there's nothing else I want to discuss.  Free posters for everybody.  And paint pens.  Yeah, but yesterday, it was just free posters for everybody.  It's always something else.  Yeah.  You should know by now we don't sign with Sharpies.  What are you talking about?  You sign with Sharpies all the time.  Not really.  Not after today.  What does that mean?  Not really.  Not really.  Okay.  Right. 
[01:41:00]  You think that girl's laughing in the car right now with her husband?  Terry?  Hopefully right now she's softly weeping as she sees the fucking telephone pole in the  middle of the hood.  All she's hearing is the buzz of the jaws of life.  Yeah.  And the chook, chook, chook, chook, chook, out the windshield wipers, which went off when  the fucking car struck the pole.  I don't care if she doesn't like us.  You can just tell she's miserable, though.  Oh, yeah.  That I know.  We take comfort in that.  Right.  Yeah, when's the last time on a 20th anniversary thing they signed with regular 
[01:41:30]  money?  Yeah, exactly.  We've never signed 20th anniversary posters with Sharpies.  Right.  You should have known that.  They're brand new.  Oh, we've got a new box for you.  Can we change the poster a little bit?  No.  It says Zopi and Anthony 20 years, right?  Yes.  And then I want right under there in fine print featuring pictures from the last four years.  Can we get that out of 20 and put four?  Can we get that out of 20?  Pronto?  Featuring pictures from the last four to five years.  I mean, we could write that. 
[01:42:00]  Corinda, I guess.  P.A., what's up?  Dude, we've got a new box for you.  Hello?  Hi, Corinda.  How are you?  Good.  Excuse me.  I'm doing great.  Okay.  Who's this?  Hopi.  Well, how come I don't hear me on the radio?  Because you're a stupid fuck.  No, I'm not.  There's a delay.  There's a delay.  You'll hear yourself in a minute and you'll start talking back to the radio.  Yes.  It'll be real embarrassing.  Oh, my God. 
[01:42:30]  Okay, this is the first time that I've ever called in.  Okay.  All right.  So, I wanted to first say good morning.  Good morning.  I think that you're making a big mistake by...  Did you hear that?  That was so mean for you to say.  Oh, my God.  She's right.  She's talking exactly what I said.  She's listening and talking back now to the radio.  Oh, you just heard you're a stupid fuck?  Yes.  Yeah, that was bad.  I agree.  Look at the radio again. 
[01:43:00]  We got off on the wrong foot.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  No, I do.  I love you guys.  I listen to you every single morning.  Oh, great.  Who doesn't?  But if you have this big, special, fancy poster that's...  It's really not that great of a poster.  Yeah, it's great, isn't it?  You know, Poster Talk has taken over Twitter.  Trust me, I know.  That's all people are talking about.  Yeah, I know that.  Most mundane, stupidest thing.  Go ahead. 
[01:43:30]  Sorry.  They're making it seem like it's this big deal, and I just want to suggest that the markers  that you're talking about trying to use, that it's a bad idea.  Uh-oh.  Um, it will wreck the poster.  The poster.  Yeah, but the poster...  That's...  Have you actually used it on a slick...  That's Philly.  Yeah.  Water.  Say water.  A slick poster of water.  Water.  Or home.  Home, I think it is.  Say home and water.  Home.  Say home.  What? 
[01:44:00]  Say home.  Home?  Yeah, say home.  Home?  Home.  And say water.  Oh, boy.  Say water.  Water.  Water.  Water.  It's more water, but...  Water.  So, she's a little outside Philly, though.  Water.  No, I...  I colored things in with a crane.  I'm actually in...  No, it's a crown.  Crown.  A crown.  They call crayons crowns.  Crown.  Crown.  It's the weirdest thing.  I don't know.  Crown.  Crown.  Crown.  Crown.  Crayon.  All right, what do you got?  Okay, well, I want to suggest, even though... 
[01:44:30]  Right.  I hate, hate, hate, despise Sam.  He is such a faggot.  He's extremely hideous.  I don't like to even hear his voice.  Wow.  Please continue.  Yes.  Please, let's not interrupt the voice of the people.  Right.  Please continue.  I'm sorry.  The floor is yours.  Right.  I'm sorry we interrupted you so many times.  Please continue.  Yes.  No, yes.  I don't...  How did he get his own show?  That show.  Because we got lazy.  I told you.  I told everyone that yesterday.  That's right.  I mean...  Slipped into the cracks. 
[01:45:00]  We got lazy and gave up, and Sam smelled blood and went for it.  Blood and water.  You guys are losing tons of air time as soon as he gets on.  Thank God.  As soon as he starts talking...  It'll make it easier to leave.  Let's go.  What's your point?  My point is, even though I don't like him, I will agree that you need to use the Sharpie.  That's what this call's been about?  She really is a stupid fuck. 
[01:45:30]  She's a wonderful listener.  Go ahead, Matt.  I'm going to apologize for that salty language by Sam.  Let me at least look at the Sharpie.  Because there's different type of Sharpies.  Okay.  I bet you didn't even get the right Sharpie.  No.  I know exactly which one you're talking about.  No, you don't.  Because there's fine, which I hate.  Let me see.  No.  Okay.  All right.  I see.  It's a regular Sharpie.  That's a good start.  It's not fine.  Brand new one.  I will consider it, Sam.  Yes.  I will think it over.  I've thought it over.  Consider it.  No.  Where on the poster do you guys want to sign? 
[01:46:00]  I want to sign not where you want to sign.  I don't care.  You guys want the yellow in the middle?  I'll take down at the bottom.  Don't sign with the Sharpie.  Just sign with the Sharpie.  Please don't.  I'm going to sign the upper right quadrant.  You're not going to sign the 20?  No.  You shouldn't.  Why?  We only have like 10 pictures on there.  Why would you sign over one of them?  I'll sign over the A.  All right, Corinda.  Thank you for your two cents on this.  I'll sign over the A.  I'll sign down here on the WOW sticker.  Oh.  I love you guys. 
[01:46:30]  You're awesome.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  For real.  Thank you.  For reals.  Who's this to?  Who am I making this up for?  Do we have names?  They do want them personalized.  No.  That's why we should.  I'm signing them at Caroline's.  How long could it take to sign 300 of them?  For real.  A long time.  Okay.  We've already wasted 45 minutes.  But these people want their names on them, too.  So let them write their own name.  That's right.  Yeah.  There you go.  Oh, Jesus.  One is done.  One.  There's one. 
[01:47:00]  One's done.  Two.  Well, it's not even done because we still have to sign.  Yeah.  I've got to wait for my liquid pad.  You just now sit here and watch.  Oh, God.  There's two done by Jimmy.  Two.  Look at that stack.  And that's not even.  That's not even.  297 left?  Oh, my God.  Really?  Holy shit.  All right.  We're going to eat.  We're going to figure out the liquid pen.  Yeah. 
[01:47:30]  There's nothing to figure out.  Yeah.  But now if they get a poster and they see that it was a Sharpie, they're going to think  I gave in.  That's true.  I don't like giving in.  No.  Oh, really?  Oh.  No.  You're going to learn that about me.  I never sensed any stubbornness from you.  Because I'm happy.  All right.  We got John Gray's coming in.  That's cool.  He's in charge of that giant Ferris wheel in Vegas.  In Vegas. 
[01:48:00]  The high roller, it's called.  Hey, yeah.  It's an amazing, an amazing structure.  How many are you up to, Jimmy?  Four open.  I'm on number four.  Oh, boy.  Four.  Yes.  Thank you for letting me sign the book.  Oh, please.  And Lorde's inspiration was really George Brad, or is that some internet goof?  I don't know.  That's very confusing to me.  Obviously, he played for the Royals, and she has that song, Royals. 
[01:48:30]  But I found a great place to sign.  Who started that shit?  Because that sounds like bullshit.  Oh.  Where?  I didn't see it.  In the bottom left corner.  Oh, there.  What?  Over Sam Roberts' face.  Nice.  There it is.  I like the way you snuck your way in there.  You've only been here a couple of years.  Why are you on the post?  Well, you don't like that Sam has the most prestigious solo shot?  It's where the eye goes in the corner.  He's got his arm up on the thing.  I haven't been here for a couple of years.  I've been here for nine years.  Nine? 
[01:49:00]  It's almost half.  Oh, wow.  You spent almost half your career with me.  No.  No.  I did radio before this, remember?  It doesn't count, though, obviously.  It does count.  I'm going to have my own special 30 years of radio soon.  Because I'm happy.  I like this year.  Thank you.  Finally, Sal.  Jesus.  He's finally playing the song.  Well.  All right.

Me? 
[02:02:00]  Yeah  Been a while?  It's been a while  I was in Vegas a couple years ago  Just an honest-to-god-true story  Staying with Bellagio  I went over to Mirage for dinner  Met some friends of mine over there  Went to Kokomo  It's a great little steakhouse  The guy brings out some fresh crab legs  He said, these just came in  I gotta give them to you guys  I'm eating them  Then we go play gamble a little bit  I had a tea time early in the morning  So I said, look  I gotta get going  I'm walking back to the hotel  I get three quarters of the way out of the lobby  And all of a sudden I go 
[02:02:30]  Oh, fuck  And I'm standing here like this  I got my butt pinched so fucking  I'm fucked  I can't move  All of a sudden  You know  Felt all right  I went just like this  Water  I had some food poisoning from the crabs  Take off my leather jacket  Tied it around my waist  And I'm just standing there  And it's just running down my leg  I got jeans on  Black bucks  No socks  And I just start fucking walking 
[02:03:00]  Every time I'm walking  Something's coming out  It's water  Straight fucking water  Then  Tell you how sick I was  Tell you how sick I was  And then I'm standing outside  And I got on my cell phone  And I called the guy  I said, Larry, you won't believe this  I'm standing outside the fucking Bellagio  I can't move  I got shit everywhere  I shit all over myself  And Larry's about a 48 waist  So he brings me over a pair of pants  And some towels  And some towels  And so then he comes over  And he meets me  I tell him where I'm standing 
[02:03:30]  He finds the closest bathroom  When you go up the escalator  To go into the fuck  I can't get in the elevator  But you are not  You lose  You know  So he goes in  He finds the closest bathroom  In the lobby of the hotel  And then I get in the escalator  And he kind of  Pretends like he dropped something  So no one gets behind me  Tells me where it is  I go in there  He goes and gets the towel all wet for me  Throws it over the fucking stall  I take off all my fucking clothes  Just wipe off  Leave my shoes  Left my shoes  My pants  Everything right there 
[02:04:00]  The towels  Right there in the stall  And I'm walking barefoot  With my shirt  And his pants  That are 48 waist  Through the lobby like this  It's midnight  Got up in the morning  Took the most perfect  Double tapered shit  I've ever had in my life  True story  Who's the pitchers  In this game  Rumor has it

Oh yeah  I got some bubble gum  There's something I wanted you to write on my photo  Could you write  I'm here too  We're getting a little attention from Scott Shannon today  Hey  Scott Shannon  That motherfucker  Oh no  What happened?  I got a tree on my house  I got a tree on my house  Let me tell you that  Maybe E-Rock should be in here  But let me tell you the power of this show  When we're not goofing off  The power  We push Scott Shannon way up in the ratings 
[02:08:30]  And Todd way down in the ratings  Is Scott beating him?  Kicking his ass  Don't underestimate the power of the show  Scott and Todd break up  Todd wants to reinvent radio or something  Even though he's doing the same little shit  Doing the same shit  Yeah  Then Scott Shannon calls our show  And was fucking hilarious  Who knew  Who knew that that guy was still in there somewhere  He's fucking hilarious  And then we gave our full support to him 
[02:09:00]  We even said to the people  If you've got a people meter  Make sure you tune in  Yes we can say that  Tune in Scott Shannon's station  When you're not listening to us  And I guess it worked  Because he did really well in the ratings  And he was talking about it here  And then he plugged Jim Norton  I'm glad to hear that  Because you guys remember  Even though we goofed on them  I was Team Scott a long time ago  Well that is true  You would make a light of Todd  For the most part  And I would say that  I didn't like the way  That they were putting this guy 
[02:09:30]  On the pain of my list  Because I thought that was Todd being  Disrespecting  Is it almost Machiavellian  Is that the right way to use that  Someone call in and correct me  On how I fucked that up  Right  I don't know  Machiavellian is like  When you make believe you're dead  And then you come back to life  Right  Is that what that is  Yeah  Let me check that out  I didn't mean to fuck it up that much  I think that's really like  You might be right  Hold on  Did he write The Little Prince  Was it that guy  Yeah  Well you could kill your enemy  What is that  And kill your enemies  Oh by making believe you're dead 
[02:10:00]  Right  But you're not really dead  So you can kill your enemies  Oh you're lying in wait  In a Machiavelli  Oh lying in wait  See okay that's kind of  Lying in wait  Yeah that's kind of what I  I think  I think that's where you're getting at  I'm just  Oh my mother used to make a Machiavelli  Oh I was fucking melting your mouth  Was his book called The Prince or Not  Yeah  Wow I knew that  Ah  Fuck up  God damn  College paying off today  Damn  Here's Scott Shannon talking about us  And mostly Jimmy 
[02:10:30]  914  And here's Z-Rock finally  Okay the boat movie  Did I do the set up right?  I didn't hear the set up  Oh  Well you do  Is to listen to the best radio show  On the station  Ratings information  Attaboy  So what happened with Scott Shannon  He did very well in the ratings  Well I'm trying to get the morning show breakdowns  Right  But for the station and all the demos  Scott at WCBS FM in New York  Is number two  And what is demo?  The demo  The station overall  Everything  Like they're doing really well 
[02:11:00]  Just come up to stage high as number one  Is Scott doing very well  Or the station's doing very well?  Because you said I'm still trying to get the  Right now I'm trying to get the actual morning breakdown  So you don't know if Scott's number two  His station's number two  His station's number two  Gotcha  Okay  And what's Todd's station?  And what was CBS FM before Scott got there?  I think they were still in the top five  I've got to find that out  But they moved up a couple spots  They moved up a couple spots  Scott Shannon took over in the morning  They're right behind Light FM  Alright now what about Todd?  Todd at WPLJ is number 17 
[02:11:30]  In mornings or the station?  The station right now  That's why they're calling  Yeah  I think it was around 13  During the last ratings period  But now it's down to 17  So he can't be doing well in mornings  Yeah  So he's not really reinventing radio is he?  No  I think so  Here's Scott Shannon  914 on the big show  You know there's a lot of people  That we need to thank on this show 
[02:12:00]  For making things happen for us  You know we're talking about the  About the radio ratings that came in  And the station is now  Number two in New York City  On the way to number one  Which is the goal  And the intent  That's one of the reasons  I came to this radio station  I wanted to be at a number one radio station  God that's how it sounds to be reinvented  I can't wait!  It's gonna be great!  Doesn't he sound though  He sounds like a totally different person 
[02:12:30]  He sounds like a different guy  Like he's happy  Doesn't he?  He's talking uncomfortably  And he knows he's not trying to shoehorn in  Before fucking that fake voice  Young Machiavellian sneak  Lying in wait gets him  He doesn't sound like a rockhead  Right  At all  He was mumbling with Todd  Yeah  Yeah  He was probably gritting his teeth  Looking at Todd's dumb face  Ready to go into character  Bang yeah  Go ahead finish up  Cause I gotta talk like that  Ugh  Sounds very lucid 
[02:13:00]  Yeah  And clear  To be at a number one radio station  And I thought this one had  The potential to be there  And it has been there before  And will be there again  And when we first started  Remember there were some problems  Because I worked on another station  With another morning show  And when we first made the switch  Why wouldn't he say  Another and all that 
[02:13:30]  Yeah  Everyone knows  Yeah  That's lame  He just doesn't want to plug them  Yeah but have confidence  Go look  When I was on the Scott and Todd show  Everyone knows what he's talking about  Right  When we first made the switch  The guys over on SiriusXM  Opie and Anthony  Yes  Hey remember that  They got behind Team Scott  That's right  And a lot of people sampled the radio show  On their direction and their advice  Right  And one of the guys on that show  Jim Norton 
[02:14:00]  One of the funniest stand-up comics  That you're going to see  He works on that show  And he also does stand-up comedy  Around the country  And he's going to be at Caroline's  Next week  Caroline's on Broadway  Brad you've seen him before  Yeah he's fantastic  Yeah  I've seen him in some big spots  In Vegas and the Borgata  And he's wonderful  If you want a night out  And just relax and enjoy yourself  And laugh a little bit  Get tickets to see Norton  Look at this  At Caroline's on Broadway 
[02:14:30]  He opens up I think next Thursday  That's right yeah  April 24th to April 27th  Go to carolines.com for tickets  New York's premier stand-up comedy nightclub  My friend Brad Blanks gets around  Talks to celebrities  From people like Jim Norton  All the way to people like Tony Bennett  God he sounds great  That was very nice  Thank you Scott  That's a great plug  You should go on a show  You can keep it clean  For a few minutes on a show  Oh yeah  Scott  Jim Norton's coming your way 
[02:15:00]  Coming your way in a few days  I think tomorrow  Oh you're actually doing it  Maybe yeah  Oh it's already in the works  Possibly  Oh okay  Very cool  Wow thank you Scott Shannon  That was very nice  All around  Absolutely  Good for him  He sounds fucking happy  And thanks to everybody  Who listened to us  And went with Team Scott  On that one  There's something about  That situation  That bugs people I think  Like when one guy  Is like doing that type of shit  Like it's not like  Both of them together  I think people just 
[02:15:30]  Kind of sense that  Like ugh  Yeah yeah  Let's be fair though  We took some brutal shots  I mean  Absolutely  I can't sit here  And act like a choir boy  Yeah  No but he turned me  He completely turned me  Totally  Yeah  We were on his side  Before that  Before that though  Because  If you had a pick  Between the two  Yeah  Todd would annoy me  Much more than  Right  Yeah yeah  But man we took some shots  Then he comes on our show  And he was hilarious  I'm like oh that's why  This guy's a legend  I get it now  That was the first glimpse 
[02:16:00]  We got of  Of the happy Scott  Right  The one that like  Was  That we just heard  Because we  For years  We were hearing  During Jocktober  You know  I had a boat movie  I had a tree on my house  And then he'd just be cut off  Or  You know  Dummy would start  His voice  Now  He's amazing  What do you want to do  You want to ride in a boat  This is Captain McSeman  Cause I'm happy 
[02:16:30]  I know  That song is just  Fucking entrenched  In my head  Well wait till you see  The video  That's in the works  I know  I gotta see that  It's a  It's a Chip Happy video  I'm working on  Cause I'm happy  Yeah  It's coming out great so far  He's ass  Let's say hi to Darren  In Calgary  Darren  Ooh  Derwood  What's up Darren  Hi guys  Hey boy  It's Dagwood  Hurry up  We got posters to sign  Yeah  You know what  I got an interesting story  About that  I'd like your signature  We'll be the judge 
[02:17:00]  The last signature I got  Of a radio star like yourself  Was of Herb Tarlick  And Les Nesson  Oh wow  Where  Well this was in the early 80's  And I sat outside  Of a radio station  And I was the only one there  And they were being interviewed  And they came out  And I was the person there  To get their signature  And their autograph  But I was impressed at the time  That's pretty cool  They were doing radio press  Yeah they were doing radio  For WKRP  Correct  Alright  I remember what I loved  About that show  Was when they were promoting it 
[02:17:30]  To say this new series  Is coming on  One of the things I liked  Was they were showing  Johnny Fever  Who was Howard Hessman  Hanging the Kiss  Bicentennial  There was a poster  There was a poster Kiss did  Of the four of them  And I think it's Peter  Playing the drums  And they're dressed like  It was the 76  The Bicentennial for America  Right  And Kiss was all dressed like that  Like they were Civil War guys  One of them had like  A red bandana on his head  With a blood stain on it  And that was a poster I had  And then Johnny Fever 
[02:18:00]  Was hanging it  And I'm like  I have to see this show  I have that poster  That's pretty cool  I used to go crazy  When I saw that  Johnny Fever was cool  Yeah he said booger  They got some of that radio  Right though man  They definitely used  Some radio guys to  Make that pretty accurate  For the time anyway  Yeah yeah for the time  What do you got Darren?  Well guys I'm in  I'm in New York today  I'm actually from Calgary  I happen to be here for business  So I want to see  Is there any chance  I can get a ticket  I know you got a ticket  For Bobo  And he didn't want it  Well I got  I got one ticket 
[02:18:30]  Laying around  I'll be honest with you  But I got to get Bobo  I got to get Bobo  Like ten minutes  To call in  To get his ticket  And I guess if he doesn't  I'm sure we can get you in Darren  Alright  But I mean  In all fairness  I got to get Bobo  The ten minutes  To call  Alright  Get his information  On the other line  Yeah  It's only fair right Sam  To get Bobo ten minutes  Yeah give him the ten  He really did seem subdued  This morning  Like he didn't want to go  And Darren just seemed  Like he was really into it  Right  Alright 
[02:19:00]  So that was the  Scott China thing  The Anthony Weiner thing  Where did he say this  Some TV network  A fusion TV  Yeah he's back in the news  We got a quick clip  I didn't hear this one  While I was doing my research  For this interview  In every article that I read  In the first lines  They were the words  Sext and scandal  Do you think  That you overcame this already  And have you stopped sexting 
[02:19:30]  And that's a question  That I'm sure everyone's asking  Look I'm a private citizen now  I frankly recognize  That I have a political background  That has a biography  That's attached to it  That I live with  The one thing I have decided  That I'm going to  Not do from the  You know unless I  Return to public life  Is start to go into  The rabbit hole  Of having conversations  About my personal life again  I think if anything  At this point in my career  I've earned the right  To say it's none of your business  Alright okay  I take that  Good for him 
[02:20:00]  Yeah but he's stupid  Why what should he say  Whenever someone  Lobs a question at you  Like that  You have a platform  To say whatever you want  So you know  No  Unless you're never  Going to get into  Public life again  But why would he say no  If then all of a sudden  You know somebody  Starts sending out  His text again  That's a good point  And then it's like  Oh he's lying again  Good point  Even though he's in  Private life  You don't want to be known  As like the liar  Yeah that's true  He's probably sexting  I bet he's sexting  The shit out of him  I am with me and him 
[02:20:30]  I'm like hey  I'm gonna make fun  Of his last name  I'm like hey we are  Right  You know what that means  Bobo has eight minutes  Left Sam  Oh man  Hope he calls in time  Sam's jean shirt  Is bothering me  In a physical way  Why?  I don't like it  Oh that?  It's a denim shirt  It looks like  It looks like  The prison garb  In like stir crazy  Denim  You're not wearing 
[02:21:00]  That tie right?  No  Okay  Because now it's a thing  Wear it around your head  Like oh I'm crazy  That's actually a fun idea  That is  I'm wearing a tuxedo shirt  Oh that's a good one  Jim  Chip  Who is this  I'm talking to?  Jim  Chip would never do that  No  Because it ain't  Rock and roll enough  We got penis clips  Yeah  That's true  And we also have  Circumcisions  Did you watch the Billy Crystal?  Yeah  Was it as bad as I said it would be? 
[02:21:30]  It was bad  Yeah  No I already know it was bad  Because I told you to grab it  Yeah  Billy Crystal was on Ellen?  Yeah  Wow  Not good  Did you get the waffle one?  Yeah  Wow  Did Ellen enjoy him?  I didn't see it  I think Ellen was polite  Hang on  Hang on  This guy is not funny  He's just turned into everything  I think he used to try to move on  Where is this clip?  It's on Ellen's website? 
[02:22:00]  Yeah  Yeah  Oh okay  It's got a web page  Push it forward a little bit  Oh here we go  It's good to see you  It's good to see you  It's good to see you  Alright  He heard her  What are you doing?  It's good to see you  I'm pushing it forward  So we don't have to hear the whole  And I had not seen this one man show yet  He's doing a one man show  About his father  It was very good  I've seen it  No you didn't  I did  On Friday and Saturday  He ran these great jam sessions  And jazz concerts  Oh no  So the only thing I had alone with him  Was Sunday  No  And he died when I was 15  And so I figured that I 
[02:22:30]  Wow I had only 700 Sundays  Which became the title of the show  But also it becomes a very positive thing  At the end of the show  When I realized  Even in this short time  What wonderful gifts I was given  By him  And in our life together  Well you have this  I had 700 Sundays  Being called a faggot  You do an impression  Of your uncle  I really think  Jack Haber  That's probably about  A thousand too few  You should have that  52 Sundays a year  That's every  Oh that's right  Sorry 
[02:23:00]  That was a lucky guess  His uh  I saw the  I was at the premiere  Of 700 Sundays  In like 2003 or 4  Yeah  And that was when  De Niro turned me down  For the picture  At the after party  For that  2003 or 4  You just said  Yes  So the show's 10 years old  His play  Yeah  So what is he  Bringing it back  Or something  I don't know  He might be filming  He's toured the whole world  Yeah he's making a movie  Oh okay  But I honestly  It was good  That was Bob  Bob yeah  That was at the after party  For that  Cavern on the Green  I was with Ariel  My ex-girlfriend at the time  Right  And I didn't know  That he uh  I was gonna 
[02:23:30]  De Niro was gonna be there  But anyway  He told some interesting stories  About like being a little kid  And like  I think Billie Holiday  Would babysit  He had some really  Really weird  I'm sure the woman  Show was great  Did he do his jazz musician guy  I don't know  Excuse me  I don't think so  I don't remember  Oh shit  You don't like that  Well he's got a new character  Oh does he  Who cares about the old character  Unfunny old comic  He's always coming up  With new characters  And boy  Wait till you hear this one  Great  And watch the crowd  They can't  Cause it's radio 
[02:24:00]  But  We'll fill in the blanks  For everybody  But you do an impression  Of your uncle  Jack Haber  Yeah  Well Jack  His face would like this  And he would go  We called him  Uncle Picasso  And he would come down  To breakfast every morning  And say  Who wants a waffle  Anybody want to have a waffle  Let's have waffles  Why doesn't anybody  Want to have a waffle with me  How  I was watching  And thinking  Oh  Wow  And I think  There was an edit there 
[02:24:30]  Wow  A bad edit  The audience  Is just kind of politely  Well they start off okay  Yeah  But then the actual material  As the  As the uncle  And waffles  Oh god  And then he ran out of steam  Talking about waffles  Yeah  Cause he was like  He realized  The uncle just said  Does anybody want waffles  Right  That was it  God  I am not a fan  I'm not either  To be honest with you  We should be too  Cause he's from Long Island  He was in a couple 
[02:25:00]  Fun movies  He just reached this point  Of irrelevance  And you know  I never liked him on SNL  I have to be the guy  That says this  No  And he had a bunch  Of those characters  I never liked it  Okay  I never liked it  I guess some of those characters  Are coming back  Are they  Yeah  For something  For something  Isn't he doing like a show  On FX or FXX  Oh no  I don't know if it's FX  Or FXX  Jimmy what do you think  Oh  You know it's 
[02:25:30]  I like Billy  But I've always said  I like Billy  I do  Of course  Yes  Of course  Why do you like him  What do you like about him  Jimmy  I've always enjoyed him  I just always have  And he's a nice guy  He's always been  Treating me nicely  Yeah  Yeah  He's very nice to me  What bit  More movie  I haven't watched him  Do stand up  Let me see  I like 700 Sundays a lot  Yeah  I enjoy that  I can't think of  The last film I saw  Yeah  He was always funny  On the roast  When he did Ali  And those  Those fucking roasts 
[02:26:00]  He was good  Those are alright  Those are his impressions  Howard Cosell  Uh huh  Muhammad Ali  He did Ali to Ali  So I respect that  Right  Uh huh  I liked Mr. Saturday Night  Did you?  Yeah  I did  It was good  Comic  Yeah  Very self-destructive  It was better than Punchline  Yeah  Schindler's List  Was a better thing  About stand up  Than Punchline  But there were certain parts 
[02:26:30]  Of Mr. Saturday Night  That I thought were really good  Like that really  There was a self-centeredness  And a self-destructiveness  That I thought was very good  I haven't seen Punchline  In years and years and years  We're given one  No  I would like to watch it now  That I know comedians  And stuff  And watch it again  To kind of really get like  Oh that is really not the way it is  Is there any clips  I haven't seen that movie 
[02:27:00]  I haven't seen it since  In six weeks at least  I watch it every six weeks  Every six weeks  Yeah brush up on  Probably 15 years  Wow yeah  Yeah like I haven't watched it  Since I started  Go with that one  It just says hilarious stand up comedy  I would bet money  It's not hilarious  Oh no  Tom Hanks and Sally Field  Sally Field  Who are they amateur people  Sally Field  John Goodman was her husband  Or Field  Sally Field  Is this how it works?  She was funnier in Lincoln  Than she was in this  Oh there goes Sally Field 
[02:27:30]  Hi  Hi  Oof  How are you?  Hi  Hi  Hi  What's your name?  Mark  Mark  Are you married?  Yes  Yes  My wife  How long have you been married?  Six months  Six months?  Too long  Too long  Now listen  You shouldn't laugh  It's very difficult  It honestly is 
[02:28:00]  I mean we all know this  You're never on solid ground  I've been married to my husband for 15 years  Sometimes he comes home  And I look at him and say  Who is this man?  How did he get in my house?  I've never seen him before in my life  And other times our identities melt  You know  I itch  He scratches  I feel better  I mean I don't know where he is  And I begin  Except in bed  When he's usually ending just when I'm beginning 
[02:28:30]  Good stuff  You know the thing is  Before we were married  When we used to  You know  Make love  He would say to me  Oh sweetheart  God damn  Wow  I feel so good  You're so beautiful  I love you so much  And now he says  Move your head  I can't see the screen  Wow 
[02:29:00]  Before we were married  Keep watching for a minute  This is really hurting  This is painful  I feel like  I feel like a black guy watching a minstrel show  Yes  The way that would make you feel  That's cringy  Oh how could you  Was this like Hollywood's idea of what stand up was  Like what  She's taking too fucking long  It's terrible  To get to the punch lines  And her dumb accent  But for the movie she's supposed to be killing 
[02:29:30]  That's what's so sad about this  She's killing right  Yeah  Hi  And the whole audience goes  Hi  Is that a fucking AA meeting  Hi I'm Sally  Hi Sally  Yes  Let's see if he gets better  Oh Jesus  And he used to go  And he used to go  And now he just goes  Pulling out a wedge  And the club owner's laughing 
[02:30:00]  Everyone's just cracking up  I think that men have it very very hard today  You do  Not when you need it  She's covering her face  She can't believe she said it  Very embarrassed  It's the only good line you had  Like it wasn't a prepared line  No  Oh she's  What'd she say  I don't know  I mean it's hard  I mean really it's a difficult situation for men 
[02:30:30]  It really is  I mean it's like women  Have gotten to the point  Where they almost don't need men anymore  I mean you know  There's like these uh  Mechanical items  You know what I mean  No  No  What do you mean  You know what I mean  You use one of these things  Oh my  Not for me  Honestly  No offense  God bless  Go to it  I scared me  It really does  It really really frightens me  What are the people laughing at

[02:32:00]  I'm sure of it  I'm sure that  Adam was an insensitive lover  He kept referring to their lovemaking  As getting some rib  What?  He had no clue what he was doing  This man  He was completely lost  I mean one of the first things  He said to Eve was  Stand back darling  I don't know how big this thing gets  It's an old Polish joke  I bet you  I bet you  I bet you  Tammy in Syracuse

[02:37:00]  Walk off  At this point  I don't know  I couldn't stand  To see things suffer  Like little frogs  Look he's crying  Oh Sally feels  Very concerned  Exactly  Because she loves  Watching frogs suffer  The waitress  The club owner  It's like this  Frog thing  And she plucked out  This frog's eye  She flicked it at me  And it's stuck  On my neck  This is good stuff  That's hilarious  I would love that  I'd be cracking up  That's pretty funny  He's crying  Off the crowds 
[02:37:30]  I think he lost the crowd  But you know how annoyed  They'd be mumbling  And shit  And shit like that  And I'm this kid  Who can't stand  This out of blood  No one would  Be watching this  All like  Just looking like  They would be heckling  Yeah  Boo  Crybaby  Yeah  Oh look  The talent guys  Are leaving  And they wouldn't  Leave in the middle of it  No  They wouldn't just

[02:38:30]  Or whatever  Then I had this incident  While I was rehearsing  For a play  That I was taking on tour  What happened?  This got numb  I was having trouble  While you were on stage?  No no no  I was in rehearsal  Over here in the studio  No was at the dentist  And my husband thought  I was having a stroke  Yeah  And so we got the diagnosis  We didn't get the diagnosis  Right away  But they knew something  Was going on  And because it's such  A tiny space  In the lining  It's a protective lining  Of the brain  Like saran wrap 
[02:39:00]  Two layers  With the spinal fluid inside  And chemo has a tough time  Getting through  Because that is there  To protect your brain  From bacteria  And infection  But it also keeps out  So I have a pill  That my wonderful doctors  At Cedars-Cyanide  Put me on  And it's been working  And I am improving  Each brain scan  Every eight weeks  This looks better  But it's not a cure  It's an incurable disease  And it's terminal  But aren't we all? 
[02:39:30]  But you're beating the odds  Especially in New York  I am  I've been beating the odds  And tell us about  This visualization technique  I mean some people at home  Might be watching  Suffering with an illness  You're doing something  Every day  To tell them you beat it  And look at black cock  On the internet  Well first of all  I made up  The doctor said  I made up  To aggressively remove  Cancer everywhere  Valerie announces  I made an acronym  Is that what it is?

[03:06:00]  Just to me  I mean  Oh  Yeah  A small stack  Oh I see  Let's do the penis stuff  Okay  Yeah  Alright  Are we going to take a break for that?  Yeah well by the way  Who is that rapper that lopped his fucking cock?  Is that what you mean?  Damn  Oh we got two penis clips  Oh  Actually three  But we played one of them  The Anthony Ween already  I don't know this rapper  He's not a huge  I don't think anybody really  Right  Yeah  This is the biggest thing he's ever done  He's cut off his own dick  Yeah  What is that?  What is that?  It's the sex tape from some of the stars of Love and Hip Hop 
[03:06:30]  Oh  Who the fuck?  Is that a girl?  Yes  Yeah  Wow  Wow  I've said that before  I don't know  It's a little suspect  It says Wu-Tang affiliated rapper  Yeah I think there's a produced one of his records really  Oh yeah  Yeah  So he's an affiliated rapper with Wu-Tang  He cuts off his own penis  Then jumps off balcony in suicide attempt  That's gotta be some kind of drug thing 
[03:07:00]  They said he wasn't high though  Wow  Unless he's on medication  I mean  Wow  What was his problem?  I don't know  Maybe he couldn't get hard  He didn't have a hit  I've wanted to do that before  When I've lost my fucking erection  I've literally thought I could chop this fucking thing off  And throw it in the street  And then kill myself right in front of this country  Wow  He was just depressed  I guess  My favorite part of the story was that TMZ found people who were with him  Yeah  Other rappers that were there with him when it happened  And they started talking to him 
[03:07:30]  And the rappers were talking to TMZ like they were the police  They were going  I don't know what happened  Roxanne  What?  Not  Oh  I thought they were talking like that  But they just kept  They wouldn't give him anything  I don't know what happened  No, I didn't see him  I don't know  Really?  Yeah, let's hear that  What happened with this dude, Christbearer?  I don't know what happened, man  I heard he cut his penis off  And then jumped off a balcony 
[03:08:00]  What did that happen?  I don't know what happened  Give me that camera motherfucker  This happened in North Hollywood  Well, you were there, though  I don't know what happened, though  So this dude was just chilling  And then he gets up  And tries to cut his  What's this ballsy guy with the camera?  I just sent him to jump off the balcony  And then  Then helicopters  You know  I just sent helicopters  And everything 
[03:08:30]  Really?  What were you doing when this happened?  I was reading a book  Okay  I was reading a book  What situation is it where  Some rappers are hanging out  One is reading a book  One cuts off his own cock  And tries to commit suicide  That sounds like a great party  Wow  I was reading a book  Yeah, the other guy wanted his turn at the book  You know, you're done with the chapter, motherfucker  Pass the book  That's funny  Is the guy all right? 
[03:09:00]  Do they reattach his penis?  You're never all right  After you chop off your dick  And jump off a balcony  You're never all right  John Wayne Bobbitt did all right after that  He did  And she threw it out the window  They had to find it  Yeah  They had to find it in dog shit  Otto's jokes  You know, if she was an Italian  She would have put the cock in the sauce  What's the latest on him, Sam?  On who?  Otto?  No  Jesus  There's no more news, Sam 
[03:09:30]  Wow  Yeah, unless there's three days  And Easter's coming  Yeah, that's true  Wow  No, this rapper  Oh  Did they reattach the penis?  I don't know that they've done that yet  I think he's just still in the hospital  But  They talked to  They talked to these two  For another minute and a half  Of them giving him no information  Wow, really?  Yeah  Let's hear more  So you weren't in the same room with him  When this happened?  Yeah  Okay  Were you in the room with him?  Yeah  I wasn't in the room with him  So you guys just heard the commotion 
[03:10:00]  And then saw him  Jump off a balcony  I didn't even see him jump off no balcony  Yeah  Was there a lot of blood?  Oh, he was most definitely blood  Yeah  What room did this happen in?  The living room?  Bathroom?  Kitchen  He don't even know  This happened in the kitchen?  So he must have done it with a kitchen knife  Or was it his own weapon?  He must have  I didn't know he had no weapon  He don't know nothing  Do you know anything about this guy?  Was he like  Mentally okay? 
[03:10:30]  Was he on drugs?  I don't know  He must have a lot on his mind  Something  That ain't something normal  A lot on his mind?  Text time was coming up  You know  You cut your dick off  That's pretty much what the government wants  Was he out?  Was he unconscious?  He probably was unconscious for a second  But he had to be okay  If I heard him yelling after that  So he got up and he was yelling after that  Was he yelling at the cops  When the cops showed up?  I don't know about all that  Did you see what happened  With what he cut off? 
[03:11:00]  Did he take that  Did the paramedics take that away?  I don't even know  I don't even know about none of that  Yeah  I went back in the room  I was reading the book  And then I went back in the room  Did he do it and then just leave it?  What book are you reading that's so good  That you lose interest in the guy  Who cut his cock off  And jumps off the balcony  The guy cuts his dick off  And jumps off the balcony  And he just can't put this page turner down  Yo man y'all let me know what happened  I gotta check out the end of this book  And see who done it 
[03:11:30]  That's a great book  Oh my god  Good for these guys though  You know I'll say the TMZ guy is not being annoying though  Like these are legit questions  Yeah right  You know where were you  But good for them though  What happened  There are no Al Sharptons  Yeah  I'm reading that happy endings  Yeah  And the motherfucker cut his dick off  I'm like I know how you feel  Amazing  How does it end?  He's still chatting  Still chatting  Without giving any info  It's in there or did he 
[03:12:00]  I can't even ask you all that  Yeah  It's not in there now though  Hell no  Yeah I ain't got nothing to do with it  Was it just you three  Or were there other people there?  I don't know  There's other people here  There's other people here  Well how do they feel about this situation?  Everybody just don't believe  It's unbelievable  Yeah  Yeah  Wow  That was every fucking interview I've seen on First 48  By the way  They got the exclusive  Yeah  I don't know nothing  Who are those guys? 
[03:12:30]  These two that we just heard from?  Yeah  Other rappers  That just happened to be there  Christbearer  Yeah  Let's see  Let's say hi to Tom in Massachusetts  Whoa  Tom  Oh cool  Hey what's going on  I'm just not wondering what I have to do to get a poster  Oh boy  Well we're going to have an email address soon  And you just email us  And then we're going to just send them out  And this is the other thing  That's not  All autographed and nice  Don is not excited about the whole poster  Why?  Thing that's happened  Poster gate 
[03:13:00]  Why?  Because now you guys are going to look to him saying  Well why can't we get several thousand posters?  Yeah we need a few thousand more  We'll sign them slowly  And we'll send them out  Why don't we just have them printed up  With our signatures on them already  Oh Chip what are you doing?  He just took a pen and wrote Chippa on one of the posters  That is one of the big ones right there  That's going to be a very valuable  That's one that you really want  That's a limited edition right there  Limited edition  There's your limited edition  Alright  One lucky fan is going to get a Chippa signed poster 
[03:13:30]  With a pen  With a pen right  I'll pick that one  You can't have a poster if you're not going to unmask  How about  Hold on a line  We'll start taking addresses now  For free posters  Don't you dare  Hold on a line  Thank you  You might as well hang up sir  Start taking everyone's addresses there  Sal  For free posters  Don't do it  Alright  Don't bother  Let's start there immediately  There's no reason to  I want to remind these guys  That this isn't the Kennedy Center's honors  They're true 
[03:14:00]  I mean I understand  But it doesn't have to be the Kennedy limo either  There's a balance in there somewhere  There might be a few problems with the poster  Is all we're saying  Yeah  We'd like to have a better vibe  Than the Dallas trademark  As they got the phone call  Cause I'm happy  What's the other penis clip  Well apparently there's a documentary coming out  And there's a penis museum I guess 
[03:14:30]  Cool  Are you the curator?  It's in your butt  This week we're displaying a black one again  It's on loan for 20 minutes  That guy's  That guy's got the fucking  Oh yeah  Yeah  Cut it off  Donating to the museum  It's in your  But the people making the doc

I've been working on it  Ah you have been  What do you think  That's what kept you off of EW? 
[03:15:30]  That must have been it  Yeah  And  And  Is mailing the photos  To  The museum  And the museum's like  This weirdo keeps  E-mailing us  Is it a penis museum?  Yes  Then how is he a weirdo  For wanting to be a part of it?  How is he a weirdo  For dressing his penis up  And sending pictures?  You know how weird you are  When the dick museum  Says you're too weird?  Where's the penis museum?  Um  For the people that  You know  Might want to go  I don't know  But if you want posters  From the penis museum  I'm sure all you have to do  Is call them  And they'll send you one  Okay good 
[03:16:00]  Yep  You ready to see this guy?  What's your problem with posters?  I love posters  Where does it start?  It's a big boudel with you  A big fucking boudel  Where's the poster that  Set you off?  I didn't  Push you over the edge  That you hate posters now  I don't have any grudges  Against posters  Was it the cat one?  The cat hanging?  Yeah  That was the one  It was supposed to be motivation  And then it ripped  And I was like  If the poster can't even  Hang in there baby  That one?  Yeah  That's the one that  It's adorable  Boy who knew like  Kitten things were big  Even back then  But you only had posters 
[03:16:30]  Not like the internet  Where every  You know  Kitten's everywhere  I have a Murphy's Law poster  I laugh at it every morning  Yeah  It's like  Oh Murphy was an optimist  Oh he sure was  And then there's Murphy's Law  I can get you  Hold on a minute  Chris the teacher  Hey am I the lucky 20th caller?

[03:17:00]  We don't have that many posters  We will  We're listeners  We will though  We will  Right?  They're working on that  No  Why not?  What else are they doing?  Edgar and Uncle Paul  Have also signed posters  Hmm  Alright let's uh  Exclusively  Let's get this clip  This man wants his penis  To be the most famous penis on earth  Oh my god  Look at this ghoul  He is a ghoul  Michael Caine  His face doesn't look real  Looks like he's wearing  Someone else's face  Draft House Films 
[03:17:30]  I've talked with people  Who have suggested  Different ideas  Things that can be  Offered to the public  Visitors to the museum  And what not  I bet he kills people  There are things  I'd like to pursue  One is a  There's a comic book  And this is a  Simplified line drawing  Of a cartoon comic book  Type of character  The Amazing Adventures of Elmo  He's been detached  He's off to conquer evil 
[03:18:00]  To see the world  Elmo  I need to find somebody  Who's an artist  Comic book illustrator  Type of person  It's a picture of a cock  Somebody's pretty creative  It's a cock  Dressed up with a cape  And utility belt  I'm excited about that  He named his penis Elmo  I think it'd be a lot of fun  And  We need to talk to Ziggy about it  The Moparts program  I think Ziggy  Will have a lot of ideas as well  Let's see  That's a Ziggy  So he doesn't have any feet  Or shoes  So he can't  No he walks on his balls  Right  Magically levitates around 
[03:18:30]  Wherever he goes  He was driving me crazy  Alright this guy  That we're hearing from now  This guy  He's the curator  Of the Dick and Balls Museum  Oh that's cool  Now is that a penis in a jar  Or something  It looks to be  If you look at this  Penis in a jar  Some of the things  Like this is a penis here  Right  Like all the things on the wall  Are penises  He has a nice hairdo  Right  He looks like Ziggy  If he just came out of the ocean  A floater  Yeah look at that 
[03:19:00]  Okay  Is this his museum?  Yes  It's his office  Well he's got an office  In the museum  Oh  Yeah  It's a lot of animal penises  You're not telling us  Where this museum is  I'm not sure where it is  Hmm  Having two or three  E-mails a day  Iceland is what I'm being called  Which?  Yeah  The penis museum is in Iceland  Iceland  Burr  Yeah  That's the last place  You want your dick stored forever  Jesus Christ  Museum is the coolest place on earth

Softly thick  Squatum and large testicles  Hang a long way down  This time next year  Elmo will be in your hands  Have fun making him famous  And  He was always sending me photos  Of Elmo  In all kinds of situations  With a  Santa Claus car 
[03:20:00]  Abraham Lincoln  That's a wanky  Now this is his dick  Yeah  And he's dressed up  He's a pretty big penis  What's he doing?  He's probably packed  Like eight and a half  He's dressed like a little astronaut  Yeah  He's got a little  Good little  Abe Lincoln  A little gig for himself  It's hard to tell from the guy's accent  But I think the curator  Just said Abraham  Lincock  Oh  That's funny  There's a joke in there  Let's hear it  I think Santa Claus  Was Santa cock  Oh let's hear it  Let's think  I'm seeing a theme  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  All right
