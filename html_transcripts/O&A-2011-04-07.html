<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, bouncing between personal anecdotes, celebrity gossip, listener calls, and promotional segments.  The show opened with Opie and Jim Norton discussing their illnesses,  Norton's bizarre dream, and their quest for zinc lozenges, punctuated by discussions of *Monty Python and the Meaning of Life*. Jay Mohr then called in from an airport, detailing a disastrous corporate gig and offering satirical observations of airport patrons, particularly overweight people consuming fast food.  The conversation veered into golf, Tiger Woods, Charlie Sheen, and listener questions about the hosts’ public recognition.  Further discussions on funniest movies (including *Stepbrothers*, *Cedar Rapids*, and *Arthur*),  a listener’s song list compared to Ronnie B’s,  and Ronnie B’s drug beliefs filled out the early part of the show.  Mohr’s continued airport observations provided further comedic fodder. A caller provided information about Mohr’s upcoming Foxwoods appearance. The show concluded this section with a segment on Anthony Cumia’s guide to oral self-pleasure, followed by brief mentions of Roland, a meeting with DMC, Kenny’s camera struggles, and a potential future show with Jared Leto.

A significant portion of the broadcast focused on celebrity encounters and the Long Island serial killer case.  Opie and Anthony recounted their experiences trying to get photos with celebrities like LeVar Burton (described as a "snippy twat"), Brent Spiner, and William Shatner, with humorous anecdotes about their efforts. Bill Burr's presence at a Metallica concert where Opie struggled to take photos was also mentioned.  The hosts then delved into the Long Island serial killer investigation, expressing cynicism about police methods and discussing a news story about a friend of President Obama ("Tit Comb") arrested for soliciting a prostitute.  Callers provided information, including one about defanged cobras in a viral video. Other viral videos, including a crying child who wanted to be New Jersey governor and another of a father making his child cry for being a Yankees fan, were also discussed.  The segment included a discussion of a photo of a woman with exceptionally large labia and speculation about its origin.  Ronnie B was a guest during this segment, and callers offered additional insights and anecdotes.  Upcoming appearances at Comic Con and other events were mentioned.

The show also featured a segment showcasing Opie's preference for "gritty" and "unpolished" things, extending to his musical taste.  This transitioned into a recurring "errand boy" segment, ultimately assigning a task to Troy.  The discussion covered social media, Kenny's herpes sore and its treatment, and a comparison of Kenny's and Dana White's social media following.  Troy's detailed account of his attendance at a Union Square pillow fight followed.  A lengthy interview with the creators of the Bill Hicks documentary, "American: The Bill Hicks Story," provided insight into Hicks' career, his relationship with other comedians, and his lasting influence.  The interview included discussion of Hicks’ appearances on Letterman, including a canned appearance. The hosts played some of John Sterling’s home run calls and teased a segment with a kids’ video before concluding this section.

A substantial part of the show was dedicated to a discussion about Bill Hicks, sparked by a caller's question about his alleged feud with Dennis Leary. The hosts discussed similarities in their material, the impact of Leary's success on Hicks, and a joke told by Hicks' brother, Steve, about Leary and cancer.  The conversation touched on Hicks' battle with pancreatic cancer, his final performances, and the documentary film, with David Tell, one of the documentary creators, as a guest.  A caller mentioned Tool songs seemingly inspired by Hicks. The discussion broadened to include the comedic styles of Robin Williams, Ricky Gervais, and Eddie Izzard. The show also extensively covered the upcoming "Anti-Social" comedy tour featuring Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and Bill Burr (who called in).  They discussed tour logistics, shared anecdotes from previous shows, and Burr discussed his short film, "Cheat."  Jim Norton's visit to San Quentin and Burr's fitness regimen were also discussed, along with tangents about Charlie Sheen's comedy tour, the US government shutdown, Mitch Hedberg, Gallagher, and Patrice O'Neal.  A Stephen Singer Jewelers contest was advertised, and the radio drama "The Spectacular Suicide" was played.

Finally, the show concluded with a brainstorming session on potential future guests, ranging from Andy Cohen and Roland to the cast of *The Borgias*, a member of Kings of Leon, a hypothetical fight between a *Spider-Man* audience member and Charlie Sheen, and even a tsunami-surviving dog.  The conversation included a crude joke about lesbian zookeepers. The hosts announced a break, a day off, and thanked the audience.

[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, the crazier, the better.  Yeah, yeah.  What are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show is on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Let's go fuck and have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Do I see a wide-awake Jim Norton today? 
[00:04:30]  Well, yes and no.  Yes and no.  I feel like a person today.  Okay.  I'm much better.  Okay.  I went home yesterday.  Okay.  At Dr. Steve's Advice, I took Mucinex DM.  At 11.30 in the morning, I went to bed.  I said, no alarm, no nothing.  I'm going to see how long I can sleep.  Woke up at 10.30 p.m.  So then I'm like, all right.  You slept 11 hours. 
[00:05:00]  I slept 11 hours.  Wow.  And then I'm like, all right.  Now, am I going to stay up here?  Because it's a little too long.  It's a little too early to be getting up.  It would have been nice if it was 3.30 in the morning.  I could have just been all chipper with that.  I took a shower.  You should have adjusted that.  Yeah, it was a little much.  So you're wide awake at 10.30 at night.  Yes.  When most people go to bed or start thinking about going to bed.  Does this song ever end?  Jesus Christ.  You don't like talking over that?  No.  Yeah.  I never notice it.  All of a sudden, I'm like, wow, it's long. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  E-Rock could fucking just keep playing that over and over again.  How'd you like your earpiece is snapped?  What happened?  What?  Well, he's already making the frustrated E-Rock face and the hand in the air.  So I walked to our supermarket and I got a little piece of chicken and some vegetables  and just ate.  And I ate two oranges, which was a mistake.  Why would you eat two oranges?  Because I figured it's fresh fruit for a sweet boy.  Isn't it amazing that sugar will keep you awake like that?  Yes, it is, Ope. 
[00:06:00]  It certainly is amazing.  What's wrong with us?  I mean, I always thought candy and, you know, the regular desserts, cookies and cake and  ice cream and all that.  Yeah, I get it.  You eat that, you're going to stay awake because of the sugar rush.  But from fruit?  I only learned that recently.  Fruit will kill you.  It will keep you wide the fuck awake.  Because I took another Mucinex DM, which is a cough.  It breaks you up somehow.  And I coughed.  I took a shower.  I watched the second episode of The Ultimate Fighter.  Nice.  You know, I wanted to be up for a couple hours. 
[00:06:30]  I'm like, I'll get a few hours.  Yeah.  And then I just laid in bed and had weird fucking dreams, man.  Really?  And I couldn't sleep.  I probably got two more hours.  What were the weird dreams?  When Kenny calls, because Kenny calls me every morning, I was dreaming about Kenny when  he called me.  That I was going, this is silly, but I have actually, I think a couple of my shows are sold  out this weekend in Columbus.  So I dreamt I was going to a sold out show and the woman called Kenny on the machine and  said, Gary, but I don't know why, but I knew that was us.  Yeah.  And she goes, we got a great sold out show, which is great because we're competing with 
[00:07:00]  Van Halen or something.  I really think a lot of myself.  And I walk down the steps thinking I'm a hot shot.  Yeah.  And there's a bunch of fans around and none of them recognize me.  And there's a closet door is the bathroom.  Boy, is that fucking telling.  Is that how fucking, uh, like a sliding door is the bathroom door, not an open and shut  door.  Yeah.  So I try to do something funny and then slam the door, but it won't close and it keeps  popping open.  Uh-oh.  So Kenny is helping me close the fucking bathroom and lock the door. 
[00:07:30]  Oh boy.  You're trying to keep some secrets in that fucking closet.  I think I am.  In that fucking closet.  But then at the end, it's like the size of a piece of loose leaf and Kenny is squeezing  it with pliers and pulling it closed.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  Wow, that's fucked up.  I know.  And then he, I woke up and I remember he had armpit odor in the dream and he normally  does not.  Kenny never smells.  You can have other than the odor of his soul.  You can have odors in your dreams.  I mean, I, I, I recognize it.  It might've just been, huh?  I might've been making up it.  Right, right.  Yeah, sure. 
[00:08:00]  So you got to sleep a little bit.  Two more hours.  Yeah.  Two more hours.  That's not bad.  Yeah.  I wake that orange just killed me and they gave me a reflex.  I searched out Dr.  Steve too, because I felt like I was two days behind you.  Yeah.  We're doing all right this week, but we, I don't know if we told the people, but you  and I are definitely falling apart.  You're ahead of me.  And I thought I was two days, uh, behind you as far as the sickness goes.  And I, I'm, I'm leveling off.  I think, I think I'm going to be all right.  But I, I searched out Dr.  Steve.  I'm like, look, man, how do you, how do you stay ahead of this damn thing?  And he told me to get zinc lozenges. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, those are good.  And I'm saying that because my wife hates when I say lozenge.  She should.  She hates that.  You have drool on your lip.  I know.  Cause I just laughed.  I hope you just laughed and drooled.  Cause it makes me happy when I get people to hate me.  It's such a fucking twisted thing.  But, uh, so I'm, I'm up, I'm, I'm at our CVS up and down the fucking aisles looking  for zinc lozenges and I can't find them.  I couldn't either.  What's the deal with that?  I don't know.  Maybe they don't carry them anymore.  They took them off the market or is that something old people do? 
[00:09:00]  Don't know.  Is it an old people thing?  No.  And then I took the, uh, the Mucinex DM.  I almost made a mistake.  It took, cause I texted Dr.  Steve.  I was like, well, what?  I was like, is Mucinex D different than DM?  Right.  And thank God I found DM in my house.  Yeah.  Cause I had D and he writes, yes, exclamation point.  Mucinex D has a Sudafed and we'll, uh, keep you up all night.  So I'm glad I didn't take Mucinex D.  But DM's all right?  I guess so.  Cause I almost took the D.  Me too.  Cause I'm like, what?  I'm so stupid.  I'm like, what is it? 
[00:09:30]  It doesn't have an M.  Get it?  I almost took the D.  I didn't catch that.  No, I went, uh, DM as well.  And then in the middle of the night, I, I'm wondering why my nose is running and, uh, you  know, just pouring out of me.  So I guess that's what it does.  It brings everything up.  I don't know.  Cause I feel, I definitely feel better.  I have to cough today.  Like I coughed up in the shower.  I took a shower last night and then I coughed up.  You can still, my voice is fucked up.  Yeah.  Uh, and I took, I coughed up a lot of the nonsense and I, I mean all day today I'll probably be  coughing like that kind of like, and getting you to spit out. 
[00:10:00]  The coughs yesterday with Ronnie P were fantastic, but nothing was coming out.  All I want to do is make you cough yesterday.  It hurt, man.  It's that, it's that raw, that raw cough.  It's crushed glass in your chest because nothing, when you're coughing, like even it hurts today  to cough, but I'm getting it, I'm loosening up, you know, phlegm, which, you know, look,  when you feel like, I don't know, does anybody else have to, like when I, when I cough up  stuff and spit, I like to see it when I've spit out.  Oh yeah, of course.  I feel like I'm healing.  Of course. 
[00:10:30]  So I was watching, I was flipping around the TV last night after the Ultimate Fighter  shows awake and I caught like the last half hour of, uh, Meaning of Life, Monty Python.  Fuck, what a great movie.  I forgot how fucking funny that movie is, man.  I don't think I appreciated that as much when I first saw it as, as, as this,  like this last half hour I just watched.  Cause we were, we were too young when it came out the first time and it was, it was too  smart for us.  It was 83, that movie.  No way.  83, dude.  It was fucking, uh, 28 years ago.  Right.  I was the scene where, uh, I love the scene where, uh, there's a Mr. Death when he guy, 
[00:11:00]  I am death.  Yes.  And the awful people are there inviting him to sit down and have some sherry.  Shut up.  You Americans always talking and saying, let me tell you something.  Oh, I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to do it again.  Please.  Tell me what color.  Clear?  No, no, no.  Oh, man.  You want clear. 
[00:11:30]  No, you want white.  I think you want clear when you're fucking, you know, coughing up luggers.  It's brown and green.  Don't you want it clear?  Meaning you're almost healthy though.  Oh, but I'm not.  I have to cough this stuff up.  I'll be doing this all day today and probably tomorrow, but at least I don't have a show  tonight, which is abnormal.  Normally I do Thursdays.  I'm glad I don't have a show.  You're going to be fine for Columbus.  I think so.  Yeah.  Funny bone in Columbus this weekend with, uh, with, uh, Jim Norton.  Let's say hi to Nick in Pennsylvania.  Nick.  Yeah.  How you doing this morning, guys?  Hey, buddy.  We're doing all right.  We're, we're kind of hanging in there. 
[00:12:00]  Hope you both feel better.  Listen, that stink lozenges are marketed under the name Cold Ease.  It is a part of the Cold Ease family.  Yes, it most certainly is.  That's called stink glycine gluconate or something.  And it's the best.  My wife and I use it on the road anytime we get sick.  And let me tell you, it really lessens the severity of any cold.  But there were differences.  Let's get some Cold Ease, man.  Zinc lozenges were different though, because Cold Ease is like a, a, a little of everything. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  And a zinc lozenge kind of tasted like a hockey puck, a small, tiny hockey puck.  And it was chalky.  Yes.  It was definitely different.  I didn't know that they were made by the same company though.  All right.  We're going to get some Cold Ease.  Chew it's Cold Ease gum if you get it too.  That's great stuff.  Yeah.  Feel better, guys.  Thanks, man.  Yeah.  I got to, I got to get down to, uh, Philly right after the show today.  I'm, I'm doing baseball today.  Mets Philly's down in Philly.  I'm going with the, uh, the father-in-law, Big Ken.  So, well, he's a, I can't, I can't fucking wimp out on him.  Where do you got to go?  Uh, let's say hi to Ryan in Jersey. 
[00:13:00]  Ryan.  Hi.  Hey.  What's that?  Um, zinc lozenges, they pulled them off the shelves because it causes an elevated heart rate.  Oh, really?  Are you serious?  No, that's not true at all.  I just wanted to talk about it.  Fucking asshole.  Good job.  I actually did have a question for you, Ovi.  You say you go out all the time, like you're just fucking around.  You go to CVS.  Has no one ever recognized you?  Or Jim?  Like, you guys ever get recognized out there?  I get, um, I get recognized every single day.  But, I don't, when we were at NEW, it was ridiculous. 
[00:13:30]  There's, there's absolutely been a drop-off, but still every day.  How is there a drop-off now when you're on a national platform and everybody knows you  more than that?  Because we really haven't, um, I haven't done TV in a while, even though I'm going to start  doing it again finally.  And, uh, we used to do a lot of road shows and a lot of, uh, a lot of appearances.  So.  I don't know.  I'll talk, I'll see ya.  Okay.  Yeah, but.  I have a decent amount of it, but in New York.  No, Jimmy gets recognized wherever we go.  But in New York, you know what?  It's much less, people will say hello, but in New York, people don't really, um, care 
[00:14:00]  as much.  You know how it is here.  In LA, I always like it more.  Because if someone in LA says, hey man, like, it's like, because out there they see like  real fucking celebrities all the time.  It's like, kind of cool that somebody likes you out there.  You're absolutely right.  Manhattan, there's celebrities walking around everywhere.  So, you know, a radio guy, it's like, what, what, what are they going to run up and try  to fucking pull my clothes off?  I don't think so.  Well, no, but they just wouldn't say anything to anybody.  Plus, I, I, I, whatever.  Who cares?  I, I wear hats and shit too.  Cause I, I, I just want to be left alone. 
[00:14:30]  Uh, Jay Boars.  Hiya, Boars.  How's Atlanta, sir?  It was good.  I'm in the airport now watching Bohemoth shovel fucking fast food into their face in the  morning.  How's your, uh, your corporate?  Oh, this was too bizarre for words.  Jimmy was at a country club.  So all I kept thinking of is Danny and, uh, I didn't realize the masters are here now.  Right.  So you have to get through master's traffic.  I get in there.  I go, so how many people are in the audience?  Is it in a ballroom? 
[00:15:00]  They go, no, you're in dining room.  Uh, you know, you're in the Freddie couple of dining room.  And I go, oh, cool.  How many people you got?  They go 20.  And I go, did someone not show up?  They go, no, these are the 20 people that hired you.  So I, I, there was like a podium and a stage and a mic and I've walked in and I shook each  person's hand.  Wow.  And I said, we're not going to need this stuff.  Right.  Well, let's just talk.  And then you got to tell stories.  You can't, Jimmy knows you can't go up there and do your act.  It was like a maniac shouting at people. 
[00:15:30]  How'd it go?  Did they laugh?  It was one of my most favorite shows.  It was really special to me, Jimmy.  I swear to God.  It was like the real people.  Wait, you know, for real, it was really, really great.  But the gig was you in front of 20 people.  Yes.  Wow.  It's odd how those things lost my mind.  Dude, those things can be horrendous or they can be the best moments of your career.  For some reason, it's so weird.  It either works really well or it's a disaster.  How rich are these guys that it's 20 guys hiring you?  It was all the brass at Discover, Discover card, like what's in your wallet. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So it was like banking people.  I mean, they were there on private jets to watch the Masters, so they got some dope.  Oh, right, right, right.  You would think they'd bring a few friends.  Each person bring a few friends, make the room nice for you.  This is the best, I swear to God.  It was so cool.  I just went up and told stories.  It was great.  That's awesome.  And then I'm sitting down.  I got like a little breakfast wrap.  Yeah.  And I'm watching people just order at Burger King like they're just fucking drunk, leaving 
[00:16:30]  a frat party.  Fucking fat, disgusting pigs.  Look at yourself.  It's enraging, right?  You want to say something.  Oh, yeah.  And they're paying with their fucking credit card.  It's like, way to go, America.  Here's my Amex business card.  Swipe that for my breakfast whopper.  Well, I roll too loud every single time.  All right, go back to your lunches.  Why bother you when you're eating?  Hey, you're not a golf guy, right?  I hate golf.  I would stay down there for the Masters. 
[00:17:00]  I wanted to go badly this year.  I couldn't get it together.  Watch people hit a ball with a stick and walk.  Jesus Christ.  It's Augusta, though, man.  This is the place to play.  Is Tiger down there?  Of course Tiger's down there.  Tiger's not going to win this fucking thing, though.  Charlie Sheen is Tiger Woods' caddy.  They both have Tiger blood.  Nine iron, winning.  You do a good, Charlie Sheen, Jimmy.  I do, Charlie Sheen, good one word.  If I fall apart after winning, though, then I sound nothing like him. 
[00:17:30]  No, I think you keep it together.  Hey, he still...  I had great dirt on John Sterling.  Yeah?  He had a ball reduction.  No.  Because, you know, I told him he likes to do his Speedos.  Really?  Jimmy, I'll be seeing you down in Tampa Bay.  I'll be wearing my Speedo.  That pitch is low.  Ah, he had a...  He said, Jimmy, Bobby Kelly, watching something. 
[00:18:00]  Jay, it's the greatest thing.  He said, Bobby Kelly, watching something.  It's the greatest thing the last two days,  trying to make Jimmy laugh to the point where he's fucking...  He's hurting.  He's grabbing his chest right now.  He's nowhere near a mic.  He's spitting up stuff on paper.  He's just a wreck.  It's productive.  It's coming out.  That's good.  That means Columbus is going to get a hell of a show.  He sounds like Felix Unger.  Don't make...  Well, actually, please make him laugh. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, dude, I'm trying really hard not to laugh,  because when I fucking...  It hurts.  I laugh at really...  It was worse yesterday.  It's like that jagged feeling.  Hey, you coming in tonight, bro?  Are you coming in?  No, I'm in Atlanta.  I won't be home till 10 o'clock.  Oh, you won't be...  Okay.  Yeah, he's got a...  I know what I'm thinking.  He could be here in an hour and a half.  So, Jay, I'm confused by you.  You don't like the college basketball...  Calm down, Jimmy.  You're an hysteric.  I don't know why in my life  when I find those two words so damn funny.  An hysteric.  Because there's always an end before historical.  An historical event. 
[00:19:00]  It sounds so weird.  You're an hysteric.  It's very Alan Arkin.  Calm down.  You're an hysteric.  Why don't you like golf, I guess,  is what I was trying to get at.  I don't know.  I just don't give a...  I just don't care about it.  I caddied for a long time.  Look at you fat fucking people.  Put your hands in your pockets  and your naked fat shows.  Please yell at them.  Please just lose your mind  and yell at them right now.  I want to go home.  When I'm home, I'll start yelling.  Please yell at them.  When I'm in JFK on my way out, 
[00:19:30]  I'll be like,  you're all fat.  Are you close to your gate right now?  Yeah.  Oh, that sucks.  Fatso!  Let's see.  I'm between Asian chow,  C-H-A-O,  and that's not breakfast food.  They're just getting pulled pork  right off the fucking...  Great Wraps Cafe.  Domino's is up and running.  Oh, look at this guy.  I think this guy just won  the Truman Capote lookalike. 
[00:20:00]  Dunkin' Donuts  where people are like,  oh my God.  Oh my God.  How do you get insured?  Insure the golf cart.  Walk the 18, you fatso.  When are you at Foxwoods?  Tomorrow night.  Oh, tomorrow?  Yeah.  Tomorrow night.  What's that hold?  1,500 seats?  I don't know.  The Fox?  The Fox.  Theater, yeah.  I think so.  I hope I feel it.  I want people to go, 
[00:20:30]  but you've got to get  the message out.  Well, we're hoping  to come in for one  last plug today, buddy.  So was I.  That was so much fun  being a list bully.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  They're killing me  with the lists.  As the cheers go by  and Ruby Tuesday,  you guys should both  should be shot in the face  as you blow each other.  Hey, I don't disagree.  What a way to go.  You didn't listen to me  the other day.  Ruby Tuesday made  Keith Richards' list,  so I'm in good company.  And Ronnie B agreed  with Tears Go By as well,  and Ruby Tuesday,  I don't think he didn't 
[00:21:00]  find that bad.  Ronnie B's list  was very similar to ours.  He didn't have...  He didn't have...  He didn't have fingerprint  files so much, huh?  We didn't play for him,  I don't think.  But I don't know why  we're acting like Ron B  is all of a sudden  the masculine test anyway.  No, Ronnie B,  you think Ronnie B,  you think Rolling Stones.  Yeah.  It works.  You know,  you want to hear  what his list is.  When I think Ronnie B,  I think of someone  cooking cocaine  thinking that children  are midget police officers  across the street.  Yeah.  That's very funny.  Absolutely.  Did he really say that? 
[00:21:30]  Yes, he did.  Yeah.  It's genius.  He saw that.  I just spit.  I just spit,  fucking...  Midget police officers.  What?  I wish I was still  on Twitter  to stick a picture  in his fucking guy's  stomach in front of me.  Oh my God.  He was so fast.  Jay,  you know what we could do?  You fucking text me that pic.  I'll put it on my Twitter  for you  because I got to see that now.  Oh my God,  he's wearing like  a canary yellow shirt. 
[00:22:00]  He's got the goddamn  birdcage  under his fucking shit.  Oh,  what did he order?  Oh,  it's to go.  It's on the wraps.  It's in a to go box.  He doesn't want anybody  to see his treasure.  Why are there...  Oh my God.  Why are there so many  messes in front of you today?  I guess because  it's the South  and they all just  wear their fucking  Daler and Hart  t-shirts  and eat.  There you go.  Why is it just full  at 6.30 in the morning?  Holy snikies.  Everybody wants to get home. 
[00:22:30]  Ronnie B,  what was his...  He was Monkey Man  and he can't hear me knocking.  Yeah,  Monkey Man,  I think he's at...  Yeah,  I believe so.  I don't know Monkey Man.  I think he might have thrown...  Who threw in  Midnight Rambler live?  Me.  That was you or Ronnie B?  I think Ronnie B  had it on his list too then.  Oh yeah,  but he had it live  off Get Your Ya-Yas Out,  right?  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  By the way,  Jimmy,  I was alone  in a hotel room  thinking of you  not gay.  Sorry.  No homo.  And thinking of you  saying that stupid idiot 
[00:23:00]  Victor drives a truck  and he's to fly a plane  and you said  it'd be worth it.  Sorry.  What?  Jimmy said  it'd be worth it  for the plane to crash  knowing that idiot  died a half second  and...  Oh my God.  Thank you.  I'm in hysterics.  Thank you.  That did please me.  I'm holding it down.  Go back to your lunches.  I'm out of you people  when you're eating. 
[00:23:30]  You got Jimmy going again.  I'm going to quote  the in-laws for Jimmy.  Opie,  say to me,  you CIA,  I don't buy it.  You CIA,  I don't buy it.  I'm the classic agency type.  Compact,  strong,  low to the ground.  Are you interested in joining?  The benefits are phenomenal.  The key is to not get killed.  That's really the key  to enjoying your benefit.  Are we square with you?  Holy shit.  God.  Funniest movie of all time.  Stepbrothers,  though,  now I think it's... 
[00:24:00]  Oh,  let's make a list.  Five funniest movies of all...  I haven't seen the in-laws  in a long time.  Many,  many years.  In-laws is great.  Did you see Stepbrothers?  Will Ferrell?  No.  I hate it.  I think we talked about this.  I hated the Stepbrothers  the first time I saw it,  and now every time I see it,  it gets just funnier and funnier.  I'm like,  I'm powerless over it.  Like,  I need to go to meetings for it.  I can't stand it.  It's so funny.  I didn't want to buy into  the stupid concept  when I first saw it.  I'm like,  this is so stupid.  But then you just let that go, 
[00:24:30]  and it's a great movie, man.  It's hilarious.  I just watched Cedar Rapids.  Cedar Rapids.  In my hotel room  with Ed Helms  and John C. Reilly  as insurance children.  John C. Reilly,  just the best alcoholic  I've ever seen in my life.  Yeah.  Is it good?  Mm-hmm.  Sorry,  I'm a big fatso  in an airport eating.  What are you eating?  Are you a muffin?  Jimmy saw Arthur.  Oh, no.  Oh, yeah.  But I think he's got some,  I think he's got some relationships 
[00:25:00]  he doesn't want to ruin,  so we're not getting  the proper review of the movie.  But I'm not,  I did think Russell Brand  was good.  I think he's funny.  I mean,  I would definitely trash Russell  if I didn't think he was good  because he won't come in  and do the show anymore.  But, you know,  I can't say he sucked  because he didn't.  There was just something  about it that was odd.  Like, Helen Mirren  was very good.  She's a great actress.  Sure.  But it's like,  I just keep picturing Gielgud.  It's hard to not picture Gielgud.  Right.  It's hard to not picture him.  Was the movie, 
[00:25:30]  just one of those movies  that you can't put your finger on it?  It's just off by a half second  the whole way through?  Yeah, it felt a little bit off.  I think a lot of those.  I did get some,  I did get some actually  good laughs out of it, though.  Jesus.  I think this movie's gonna be  just a major fucking bomb.  What's Rotten Tomatoes do?  Because I know that,  I looked at Rotten Tomatoes,  it was 7% for the critics.  Really?  But 84% for people who saw it.  What's wrong with people?  I mean,  it was a huge difference.  I think you got it backwards, 
[00:26:00]  though.  What's wrong with the critics?  Yeah.  Your job is to criticize things.  You're right,  but I mean,  84% like the movie  and 7% of the critics  only like the movie.  It's 84% want to see it.  Oh, want to see it.  They haven't seen it yet.  They haven't seen it yet,  obviously,  because it's not in theaters.  Okay, so.  Now, this thing is gonna be  a major fucking bust.  Major.  I actually didn't realize that.  I think that's why  Russell's really not doing  any press for it.  He's doing, like,  the basic places,  but he's not getting down.  He's doing a press for hop. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  So, who's near you now, Jay?  Um, I got this big...  He looks like, um,  the guy in the Priceline commercials  with William Shatner.  He was...  What?  Um, the big fat guy  in the Priceline commercials.  Yeah.  And he flies around  in a fur coat.  Yeah.  He was bald.  He's in a canary yellow shirt.  Um, at 1 o'clock here,  we got a young Asian couple  who are eating  fucking fried chicken.  You better be on  a Japanese clock, people.  Six fucking...  Well, they're young, though.  They're probably thin, too. 
[00:27:00]  Well, yeah.  Of course they're thin.  They're age.  Uh, there's a few  lesbians behind me.  I only...  I'm guessing  because of the turtleneck sweater  and the sweater vest.  Yeah.  Either that  or there's two Jim Trestles  sitting behind me.  Nothing.  What airline are you flying?  I'm flying Delta.  I knew it.  You know, it's a Delta.  Next thing you know,  they hand out oars.  They are very big.  Did you do Larry Merchant  for the people  you did the private show for?  Jim, 
[00:27:30]  when you're in Augusta,  there's an old saying,  sometimes the bear gets you,  other times  you  you get the bear.  Now,  Jim,  last night,  I got the bear.  these people  more is down.  Down goes more.  I got the fight  14 to 1.  I got it,  Michael Moore.  All the way.  It's a blowout.  It's like a 12-round fight.  He's got a 14 to 1. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  I like how I let him  and always checking in  from the Ho Chi Minh Trail.  Okay, Jim.  All right,  let me board my flight  and sell some tickets  for the Foxwoods Casino  tomorrow night.  And I'll be in next week  with you,  I hope.  Yeah,  we're debating  if we continue next week.  I think we could do  a couple days.  Maybe one or two.  We might do Monday,  Tuesday next week  and then we'll  shut it down  and take a break ourselves. 
[00:28:30]  So,  all right,  Jim,  Jim,  we're next week.  Fuck it,  let's do it.  Best U2 song list,  best comedies of all time.  All right,  best comedies of all time.  That's a rough one.  Easy.  Would Step Brothers  be on that list  or is it still too new?  Right after Ruby Tuesday,  I went on.  All right,  enough with the Ruby Tuesday.  See what I mean?  I'm over here now.  I'm really making a scene  I gotta get out of here.  Have a safe flight, bro.  Call us when you land.  Okay,  I think you'll be off the air,  but I will, sweetie.  No,  isn't it, 
[00:29:00]  what do you got,  three hours?  My flight is boarding soon.  I gotta get over there  and I land at about 9.30.  Oh,  yeah,  sure.  All right,  call just for the hell of it.  You know me.  All right,  Jay.  Jay Moore is gonna be  at Foxwoods.  Goddamn toenails.  Jesus.  Jay Moore,  Foxwoods tomorrow night.  Thanks,  Jay.  Hey,  Jimmy.  Yes,  buddy.  Have a great time in Columbus.  They're gonna love you.  I hope so.  Thanks,  Ben.  By the way,  that Jim Trestle reference  will come in handy for you.  I don't know who that is.  He's the coach at Ohio State. 
[00:29:30]  He's known for wearing  sweater vests  on the sidelines.  He just said he looks  like a lesbian  and they will instantly  boo.  Oh,  could they like him?  He's one of ours.  Boo.  Okay.  But,  you know,  you can work magic  like nobody else.  I'll give them the business.  That's right.  I'm at gate 13  on flight 15.  A-Rod and Thurman Munson.  What could possibly go wrong?  Oh,  my God.  This is my last call.  Lead a nice run,  boys. 
[00:30:00]  Yes,  you got Jimmy choking again.  All right,  Jay.  Thanks,  brother.  All right,  hold on.  Passing the pillow  and luggage store.  Like,  just somebody running  to the airport  holding their goddamn  laundry in their hands.  Idiot.  All right,  bye,  guys.  All right,  Jay Moore,  everyone.  And,  uh,  Pat Duffy's father  wants in.  Mikey,  what's up,  brother?  Hey,  how's it going?  Hello.  Jay's gone.  Saturday night,  he's doing a benefit  in Flemington.  I guess he just  doesn't want to  talk about it.  Wait,  he's doing a benefit  where?  In Flemington,  New Jersey,  Central High School  for the Anderson House. 
[00:30:30]  It's a rehab place.  Oh.  I don't know if he had  there.  I think it was his mother.  I'm not really sure.  Oh, okay.  But he's going to be there?  Yeah,  there's still tickets  available,  so.  We thought you were  calling to apologize  for what your testicles  has done.  Say again?  I had a joke that bombed.  I thought you were  calling to apologize  about Pat.  How's Pat?  Pat's doing well.  He's doing all right.  You know,  he's working,  you know,  if you want to,  he's working for  the Hunterdon County  ARC,  you know.  Jesus.  American Retarded  Association. 
[00:31:00]  That's wonderful.  He should be in radio,  but this radio business  is a bust right now.  All right,  so Jay Moore,  Saturday,  where again?  At Central High School  in Flemington.  Okay.  It's a benefit  for the Anderson House.  I think it's 65 bucks  and then I think  his meet and greets  is 100 and a quarter  or something like that.  All right,  so you're a good cause.  I think he's trying  to get as many people  to Foxwoods first  and then they'll worry  about that gig.  Thanks, Mike.  All right,  dudes,  have a good day. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah,  right on,  man.  So,  there you have it.  Wow.  I'm looking at this  apartment for sale  in New York.  Has a pool inside of it.  It's a 26-foot pool.  Really?  Fucking $11 million.  How many rooms?  Six bedrooms.  It's just,  what people can afford  in Manhattan  is amazing to me.  You wonder  what all those people do.  Yeah,  and a lot of that,  I bet it's not even  their fucking,  their first place.  Well,  the Time Warner building,  a lot of those people  use it as their second apartment.  There's $30 million  apartments in that building.  And it's their second apartment.  Oh,  yeah,  their second home.  Well,  you know, 
[00:32:00]  I mean,  most people know by now  that you and I live,  we're kind of neighbors.  Yeah.  You live in the building  right next to me.  Most of the people  in my building,  they're gone the whole summer.  Really?  Oh,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  They only come back  to New York  for their kids  to go to school  and then they go  somewhere else.  Oh,  yeah,  it's true.  They want them  to go to school.  So it's almost like  a second apartment  for these people.  My building clears out,  man.  It's like a ghost town  in the summer.  I think mine does too.  Isn't that weird?  Yeah,  it is a little bizarre.  That's fucking money.  Yeah.  You think, 
[00:32:30]  I think I'm doing okay  in my life right now  and wow,  you realize there's  so many more levels  no matter who you are  and what you do.  Do you want to see  how cute I was  when I was a boy?  My Aunt Donna  brought me these photos.  Was I not a sweet little boy?  Was this before  the molestation?  I don't know if there was one.  I hope there was.  It would explain a lot.  You really don't know  if you were molested?  No,  I have no memory  of being molested at all.  None.  Why did she send you  those pics?  She came to my show  in California  and Kenny,  I gave him to Kenny.  I forgot that he had them.  Did you tweet those?  Yeah.  Oh,  good. 
[00:33:00]  I forgot about them.  But no,  I don't remember  being molested at all,  actually.  Get me a bucket  of bit of syrup.  Meaning of life.  Hilarious,  that movie.  What about the scene  where the woman's  just fucking giving birth  and the kid's dropping  on the kitchen floor?  I didn't see that part  yesterday.  I haven't seen it.  You know that part,  though, right?  I don't remember.  With the Catholics  and the Protestants.  I don't remember.  The Protestant families,  they have no kids  because what?  You know,  they use birth control.  I forget the joke  because it's been so long.  And then they go  to the Catholic household 
[00:33:30]  and the mom's in the kitchen  and another baby  just drops out  and she says something like,  could someone get that?  Like,  just so casually  like we had another one.  I'm going to buy that movie  so I can watch  the whole thing this weekend  because  fuck,  I hadn't seen it  in so many years.  I was a big  Monty Python fan  growing up  because one of my friends  was,  but I think  I never really,  I think most of their stuff  was way over my head  and I was trying to be  like,  you know,  too cool for the room guy 
[00:34:00]  when I was in high school.  Right.  Like,  look,  I like Monty Python  but I think a lot of that shit  went right the fuck over my head  and I only really started  appreciating it  later in life.  Dude,  I was laughing  at some of the stuff  like the part I saw  was the liver,  came for your liver.  Yeah,  yeah.  The liver donor  where they just take  the guy's liver out  while he's alive.  Yeah.  And there's this bizarre  song and dance thing they do  which I would have hated  in high school  because it wasn't like,  you know,  where he opens  the fucking  refrigerator door  and Eric Idle  gets out  and sings a song 
[00:34:30]  about how vast space is.  Yeah.  Whenever life gets you down,  Mrs. Brown.  It's so bizarre.  And things seem hard or tough.  This was in the middle  of a liver taking scene  but I'm just like,  what a brilliant  thing to do.  It's not even  that funny a song.  Right.  It was just nice  and informative.  Yeah.  Like,  I really enjoyed this.  They were just so weird.  Just remember  that you're standing  on a planet  that's evolving  and revolving 
[00:35:00]  at 900 miles an hour  He's so nice  to listen to.  That's orbiting  at 90 miles a second  so it's reckoned  a sun that is  the source  of all our power  The sun  and you and me  and all the stars  that we can see  are moving  at a million miles a day  In an outer spiral  I'm at 40,000 miles an hour  of the galaxy  we call  the Milky Way  Our galaxy itself 
[00:35:30]  contains  a hundred billion stars  It's a hundred thousand  light years  side to side  It bulges in the middle  16,000 light years thick  but out by us  it's just  3,000 light years wide  We're 30,000 light years  from galactic central point  We go round  every 200 million years  And our galaxy  is only 
[00:36:00]  one of millions  of billions  in this amazing  and expanding universe  Now there's a graphic  that becomes a woman  Yeah, why did they decide  to just put this  in the movie  It must have  It was about  showing how unimportant  she was  to give up her liver  and this was a bizarre thing  and now there's a woman  shaped like  in a grid  green woman  pregnant  and she's not  pussy opens  and like stars 
[00:36:30]  burst out of it  1983  It's very conceptual  What was their deal?  Were they  hot guys?  I don't know  They were just geniuses  This is like tripping shit  We hit the post by the way  As fast as it can go  At the speed of light  you know  12 million miles a minute  and that's the fastest speed  there is  So remember when you're feeling  very small and insecure  How amazingly unlikely  is your birth 
[00:37:00]  And pray that there's  intelligent life  somewhere up in space  Cause there's bugger all  down here on earth  That's how it ends  Oh they're not showing  the John Cleese part  Yeah  I just found that to be  very nice  Yeah  And a very informative tune  Yeah it's a little toe tapper  Love Eric Idle  In the middle of a  very good comedy  Especially when he went  to fucking Batford  saying how he didn't care  if comedians were likable  They just had to be funny  I really love their  Alright on  Let's say hi to Seth  in Boston  Seth 
[00:37:30]  Hey boys  Oh hold on  I'm getting where  they like their pot  Oh it's not surprising  Yeah alright  Cause that's some  tripping shit man  What do you got Seth  Yeah you just  You guys described  I think it's the beginning  of that movie  Pretty nailed on  That woman's washing  dishes in the kitchen  And you see her water  break and a baby  just falls out  with the umbilical  cord attached  She just reaches out  and says could somebody  get that  And it's a Catholic house  with like a hundred  kids in it  Yeah  And after the skit  the kids start singing  that song  Every sperm is wasted 
[00:38:00]  Every sperm is good  And something about  if any sperm is wasted  God gets quite irate  or something like that  You see him marching  down the street  and the Protestant guy  starts trashing him  Yeah  Because those silly Catholics  don't use birth control  Yeah  And he's sitting in this  prim and proper house  and that was the bit  you were describing  and that's pretty much  what it is with it  The Protestants  are bashing the Catholics  because they're having sex  and having children  left right and sideways  while the Protestants  are being prim and proper  and using a condom  But the song on it  that's Every Sperm is Wasted  Every Sperm is Good  that's the song 
[00:38:30]  they were singing  they marched down the street  Yeah thanks for helping me out  Every Sperm is Sacred  Yeah  Because I haven't thought  of this movie in 20 years  Me neither dude  But the Protestants  yeah they're in a nice house  so they have no kids  because they're  you know  they're doing the right thing  and not just having kids  because you have to  and the Catholic family  has like  yeah  kids all over the place  How great was it  the fucking death scene  is still my favorite  because he's just so mean to them  like uh  he's just  the fucking  the one woman  who is like um 
[00:39:00]  how could we all have died  at the same time  and she makes the face  like I gotcha  Yeah  fucking then he points  at the salmon moose  no  Fuck now I'm gonna have  to see the movie  It's phenomenal  because I'm a little out  right now  Thank you Seth  You got that song?  Who's God?  Sam?  Every Sperm is Sacred  We believe  Well let me put it like this  There are Jews in the world  There are Buddhists  There are Hindus  and Mormons  and then  There are those 
[00:39:30]  that follow Mohammed  but  I've never been  one of them  I'm a Roman Catholic  and have been since  before I was born  And the one thing  they say about Catholics  is  they'll take you  as soon as you're warm  You don't have to be  a six footer  You don't have to  have a great brain 
[00:40:00]  You don't have to  have any clothes on  you're a Catholic  the moment  that came  because  every sperm  is sacred  every sperm  is great  if a sperm  is wasted  God gets  quite irate  Every sperm 
[00:40:30]  is sacred  Every sperm  is sacred  The guy is poor  as shit  because he had  all these kids  There's fucking  nothing but kids  in his fucking  little teeny house  There's gotta be  like 30 kids  It's awful  It's more than that  It's gotta be 50 kids  Are they going with 50?  Oh it's horrendous  You think half those kids 
[00:41:00]  knew what they were  singing about?  They're all way too young  to understand sperm  I love when the men  dress like women  in Monty Python  that makes me laugh  every time  they're just the worst  women  Yeah they absolutely  didn't want to be 
[00:41:30]  around women I guess  huh?  Lost Jimmy again  Get it out Jimmy  Get it out  Every sperm  is sacred  Now it's just  becoming a huge  musical number  on sperm  Yes  They really were  very absurd  Every sperm  is good  Every sperm  is limited 
[00:42:00]  Can your  neighbor run  Every sperm  is useful  Every sperm  is fine  What is this  a take off  like?  What movie?  Probably like  Oliver Twist or something  Probably  Oliver  Amy something  That was just a fuck  Yeah  As a kid growing up though  it's like I thought  they were funny  but like something like  this I wouldn't have  enjoyed  because I wouldn't  have realized  there was a social  point to it  whether you agree or not 
[00:42:30]  at least they were  saying something  Yeah of course  Are we going to keep  going with this?  No I'm done with it  You're done with this?  Yeah because now  I'm thinking of how  funny it was when  they were in the  restaurant and the  fat guy's vomiting  on people  Yeah  And the other people  around are too  polite  and they want to  leave  they have to go  Right  And he's like  what does  did you not like  this service?  And just vomit  all over  and the woman's like  no I'm having a  rather heavy period  and her husband's  embarrassed like  oh no we have to  catch the train  and she's like  oh yes the train  I wouldn't want to  bleed all over the  seats 
[00:43:00]  Ah fuck it made me  laugh man  This is a  the baby bird  reminds me of this  scene man  the famous baby bird  we did  The vomiting is  Where they get in  the bucket  Yeah  Oh it's great  Hey Martin  Would monsieur  care for an  aperitif  He's got puke  all over him  Just fucking bread  this  Excuse me  No sauce  It's been a long time  It's been a long time  It just sounds disgusting 
[00:43:30]  Like a five star restaurant  Puke on his shoulders  Puking right into the menu  which makes it  splatter everywhere  A wise choice monsieur  And now  How would you like it served  All mixed up together  in a bucket  Yeah  With eggs on top  But of course  Avec des oeufs  Frites  Don't skip on a patty  Oh monsieur  I assure you  Just because it is  mixed up with  all the other things  we would not dream of  giving you less than 
[00:44:00]  the full amount  In fact I will  personally make sure  you have a  Now you got me  just watching a movie  Jimmy  I know  But the scene  is the vomit  and the vomit  is so obscene  Six bubbles of  Chateau de la tour  45  and a double  jar of bomb  The vomit  is so obscene  Yeah  And it just  projectile  like a fucking hose  It's a great scene  And it looks pretty real too  It's dripping off  the menu  It's disgusting  Everywhere  He hasn't even begun  puking yet  Really  The cleaning woman 
[00:44:30]  he's running on her back  He's just puking  on the cleaning lady's back  Everyone else is  trying to enjoy  Oh there's the woman  Nice  They're too polite  No the food  was excellent  Perhaps you're not  happy with the service  No no  no complaints  It's just that  we have to go  I'm having rather  a heavy period  I shouldn't have  blown it  And we have  a train to catch  Oh  Oh yes  Yes of course  we have a train  to catch  and I don't want  to start bleeding  all over the seats  Could have me  to ruin the punchline 
[00:45:00]  It's alright  It just keeps going  It's a great scene  We shouldn't be  watching a movie  on the radio  But it's fucking  What are you gonna do though  It happens  It's very very funny  And of course  John Cleese was brilliant  It's coming in  from Reese W and MD  I think he said  about writing too  Somebody said  maybe we've said  this on the show  but you should write  for like  he thought it took  45 minutes to get  past a lot of the  bullshit into where  your creativity was  I forget what his  writing style was  Again that might be  different if he's  smoking pot  But these movies 
[00:45:30]  did really well  and like we said  earlier the humor  goes over a lot  of people's heads  right  Yeah but there was  enough stuff like  this that is just  universally gross  and hilarious  I mean you can't  not enjoy this  Of course  This fucking  big fatso  Of course  Dude get me a bucket  Alright why don't  we take our first  break  It's 7 o'clock  President Obama's  close friend  You hear about  this guy  Boy did I  Yeah we'll just  leave it right there  for a second  When we get back  we'll tell you what 
[00:46:00]  President Obama's  close friend  I guess he really  knows this guy  Got in a bit of  trouble  We'll tell you  what that is  Also  you're not really  a Nirvana fan  are you Jimmy  No but I  I don't mind them  You know  They're fine  I respect them  He's never  in my band  Kurt Cobain  17 years ago  a couple days ago  Right  Died  Killed himself  Some people say  murdered  No he was  Yeah  Is Ian Halperin  one of those guys  that says that  he was murdered  Yeah I think  he might have  written a book  even  I'm not positive 
[00:46:30]  but I  I think his book  did pretty well  Ian Halperin  that was one of  his first things  that he did say  that Courtney Love  killed him  Well Jared Leto  posted a video  of him singing  Penny Royalty  and a little bit  of Rape Me  and supposedly  he's kind of  auditioning  because he might  be doing a little  picture about  Kurt Cobain  but some people  love it  and some people  fucking hate it  There's no real  in between 
[00:47:00]  Did you see it?  Can we show him  going into break?  Sure  It actually works  going into break too  because listen how  close he sounds  to Kurt Cobain  and he filmed it  in such a way  where he looks  like Kurt Cobain  I think I put this  on my Facebook page  yesterday  if you want to see it  How is it by the way  You're on what?  OP Radio fans  on Facebook  I finally joined  the Facebook  fucking crowd  Yeah  But I put this up there  but listen  what were you going  to say Jimmy?  Oh because  Sam was looking for it  Yeah  I was just  the Danny McBride film 
[00:47:30]  Your Highness  flashed as an ad  or something  I'm just wondering  if it was doing well  I just kind of  thought out loud  I saw it  I liked it  It was alright  It opens Friday  Oh it's not open yet  It opens tomorrow  It's going to do very well  But check this out  and it works on the radio  as well  But look how  Jared Leto  looks a lot like  Kurt Cobain  in this little  video he made  Go ahead  Wow  Looks just like him  Yeah he does 
[00:48:00]  But a lot of people  But a lot of people hate  Jared Leto  for some reason  He's trying to be a rock star too  From all my time  With everyone  my time  with everyone  I have

[00:52:00]  The Virus  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show  The O.P. and Anthony Show  I don't understand Roland  does anyone else  yeah I do  yes  he just talked to us  for 15 minutes  I don't even know  what he said 
[00:52:30]  he said he's got to  go get a coffee  and then make poo-poo  and pee-pee  he did say poo-poo  he said  did he say that he  crapped at 1 in the morning  and it smelled so bad  it woke up his neighbor  downstairs  is that what I heard  that's right  alright so then I guess  I do understand  yeah  I wish I didn't  he's a strange guy  he's walking around  with his working class hero  t-shirt today  so Jimmy  met a big celebrity  yesterday  what a nice  DMC from fucking  Run DMC  was coming by 
[00:53:00]  to do other channels  so I went down  because we had a fire drill coming  I'm like I'm not getting  stuck up here for this  so I went to the lobby  to meet him  and what a nice  fucking  he's one of the nicest guys  I've ever met  celebrity wise  down to earth right  because I had the camera  and he came in  and Kenny was fumbling  with the camera  like he turned it off  by mistake  and it wouldn't work  and so  I'm up there  holding his hand  and the fucking  camera's not working  so I'm like Kenny  just do that  and he goes okay  and he holds it up  and it's wrong  and the flash doesn't work 
[00:53:30]  and then we actually  Daryl actually said  well let's turn this way  and face the way  he treated me  the way I've treated fans  so I'm happy  that was good karma  coming back  because I've had people  panic with the camera  before I'm always like  relax  and everyone just relax  we'll get this done  what was Kenny's problem  though  Kenny has taken  many many celebrity  photos for you  he'll blame the camera  but it wasn't  the camera's fault  no  I'll turn the camera on  I'll just show you how  you turn it on  and you move the flash  and that's all  you have to do  it was just  I know he was just 
[00:54:00]  probably not  it's on  and the flash's on  and it's ready to go  that's it  yeah but I know  he was probably  pushing the buttons  and moving everything  left and right  so right at the moment  where you're gonna  take the picture  that he pushed the button  so the lens goes back  into the camera  is that the worst  and then he goes  okay I got it  I'm like the flash  didn't go off  you put a lot of pressure  on the people around you  Jimmy  there's a flash  I'm like here you go  just hold it down  and take the photo  I haven't  I'm trying to think 
[00:54:30]  the last picture  I took for you  because I had to retire  it was too much  it was too much stress  probably Metallica  at Metallica  was it  no  I don't think I took  those pictures for you  when you made us  wait backstage  for an hour and a half  it was well worth it  though  now I got my Lars picture  you got your Lars picture  but me and Florentine  were fucking  giggling like  school girls  Bill Burr was there too  and Bill  we were all laughing at you  because you had everyone  in a panic  back there  including us  Florentine was laughing  but you know what  that son of a bitch 
[00:55:00]  loves pictures too  he's one of those guys  yes he certainly does  I pick and choose  like I didn't go  Sinbad yesterday  I should have went Sinbad  why not he's here  I pick him  that one I didn't  feel like I needed  oh I would get everyone  you never know  I never know why  so what happens  but you like to have it  like you have your  Kinnison one  I know you liked Kinnison  I love my Kinnison one  I love my Clinton one  I love my George Carlin  that's about it  who else  none of them are on my wall  or anything 
[00:55:30]  oh my god dude  I love them  I like my Tyson  my fucking  I love all of them  well I didn't get Tyson  my favorite experience  with Jim was his  LeVar Burton  what happened with  LeVar Burton  did we tell that story  that snippy twat  a while back we did  but that was the one  when we were at Comic Con  and Jim was asking him  at one of the events  if he could just snap  a picture real quick  when he walked in  and LeVar  what did he say  let me  first let me complete  my mission  he had just arrived  we were talking  Shatner was doing  that thing from the ship 
[00:56:00]  and I had already  interviewed Shatner  yeah  so there was a crowd  gathering watching  Shatner and LeVar Burton  who was the other guy  Data from Star Trek  he was pretty famous  for a while  oh he's huge  and then they show up  and LeVar Burton  I'm like have a picture  he's like um  let me complete  this mission  he talked to me  in fucking Trekkie talk  this fucking douche bag  so he said no to me  and I was like  fucking I'm getting  this picture  he was in fucking roots  I don't care about this shit  Jim almost 
[00:56:30]  after that  Jim wanted a picture  not even so much  for himself  but just to spite  LeVar Burton  I was so fucking aggravated  that Quinta said no to me  could you say it again  what did he say to you  let me  complete this mission  first  and he put his hands out  like I would go  oh okay  fucking Star Trek blows  right  I don't care about it  did he think you were  a Trekkie  of course he did  I was standing there  watching Shatner  and I asked him  for a picture  and then  we were stalking him  throughout the whole time  fuck yeah  he kept trying to go  on stage 
[00:57:00]  like to get  William Shatner's  attention  and Shatner kept  blowing him off  saying yeah whatever  next segment  who cares  and so we were  stalking him  trying to find him  when was going to  be the opportunity  and Jim saw him  take a couple pictures  so he goes  now now now now  and we go over  and do you remember  his face  when he saw  that it was you  he fucking  hated me  he knew I caught him  with his hand  in the cookie jar  though  he fucking  because Sam  had the camera  this was all positioning  and he had like  a suede jacket 
[00:57:30]  and he had taken  a picture or two  and I'm like  do you think we could  just  and he just turned  gotcha  shithead  because he was  taking pictures  with girls  and like  and then Jim  just kind of  snucked next to him  you think we can do  one more  and he goes  yeah  and he turns  around and looks  at Jim  like you son of a  and then I asked  fucking I asked  that germaphobe  boy the guys  from the next generation  are real jizz bags  I asked Spiner  and he said no  at first too  Brent Spiner  who was dating  right  yeah  what was great  about the Brent Spiner  picture though  was he had just  gone on stage  to speak 
[00:58:00]  and he said  he doesn't like  to shake people's hands  oh that's right  and Jim goes  watch him  and he got him  to shake my hand  and he goes up  to him  and just to get him  to like take the picture  he goes  hey you were great  on stage  just so you know  you know  I don't shake hands  with people either  and Brent goes  oh okay  and Jim goes  can we get a picture  and he goes  yeah  and they take the picture  and then Jim goes  thanks a lot  and extends the hand  for a handshake  it was such a fucking reflex  and his hand went up to it  I was just  I didn't even 
[00:58:30]  I was like okay thanks  and we just shook hands  and I was so pleased  with myself  after he had just said  he never shakes hands  good  take that  fucking  you played a robot  you're not really one  fucking idiot  oh fuck that rules man  really annoyed me  the two of them  what a fucking attitude  but you got him  of course I got him  of course I got him  I always get him  because those things  are rock stars  right  they really are  yeah but Shatner  and Hasselhoff  were easier to get to  than Brent Spiner 
[00:59:00]  and Kunta Quinte  yeah Kunta Quinte  fucking said no  but you know  on the other movie sets  he certainly would have  been compliant  I should have got him  on Roots  hey picture  was he smiling  LeVar  no  why would he be  hating me  oh he was  really  he didn't even fake it  and then it was hard  to get the picture signed  I had to get E-Rock  to get it signed for me  I paid to have it signed  is it important  to get the picture signed  why not  it's just the next level  sure  it's just  I have it  in your serial killer  mind of yours 
[00:59:30]  it's just fun to do  I mean  this is supposed to be  hookers  you know that right  I know  it's the same mentality  these are trophies  you're collecting trophies  we all know that  we've been saying that  for years  I'm trying to find  where my  I don't have to look for it  while we're talking  where my god damn  I'll show it to you  if I can find it  LeVar Burton picture  yeah  he was not happy  yeah he just doesn't  look like  alright take it  take the picture  he knew I caught him  too  yeah cause he wasn't  gonna say no  he had just taken pictures  he just took one  and he knew that  he knew that 
[01:00:00]  somebody had been  watching him  and caught him  taking a cookie  he didn't like that  and you don't even  like Star Trek  stinks  you caught him  taking a cookie  fucking  Star Trek stinks  like he knew that  I  here's what happened  he had said to me  I said look  can I have a cookie  and he said no  we have to have  our dinner first  and then he knew  he reached into the jar  and I happened to  tap his shoulder  as his hand was  on an Oreo  did he go  oh you who  and then he said  now may I have a cookie  may I have one now 
[01:00:30]  and he had to just go  yes and give me  half of his  you know I'm not  a big Star Trek fan  alright well  it's ridiculous  try to find that  touch his space man  Obama's friend  wow  this is just hitting  huh  yeah  I don't think  it made the papers yet  President Obama's  close friend  and golf buddy  arrested for soliciting  a prostitute  yes  in a Hawaii sting  operation  good man  one of President Obama's  close friends  has been arrested  in a prostitution  sting operation  Robert Bobby  tit comb 
[01:01:00]  yeah  that's what he's  pretty much doing  combing for tits  tit comb  that's his last name  there's no other way  to pronounce that  t-i-t-c-o-m-b  that's tit comb  that's right  49 a long time  friend of the president  was arrested  after he allegedly  approached an undercover  police officer  posing as a prostitute  in the downtown area  of Honolulu  you know what  by the way  what a fucking  waste  of taxpayer dollars  to have  a bunch of cops  one posing as a  prostitute  a bunch doing this 
[01:01:30]  the paperwork  the man hour  to stop a hooker  from fucking  sucking a guy's  dick in the car  I hate these  undercover stings  what are they  trying to accomplish  you think  it's just moral  policing fucking  bullshit  drives me nuts  I would understand  if it's near a  school or something  only if it's kids  man  you know what I mean  if you're trying to stop  underage shit  fine but  if it's in a shitty  area to begin with  what are you really  fucking doing  leave old Robert  fucking  what's his name  oh  tit comb  tit comb was one of  the four arrested  during the sting  not to be confused  with Robert  clit brush 
[01:02:00]  right  tit comb  49  was arrested  on suspicion  of  yeah alright  we did all that  already  so according to  why news  now  Mr. Obama  and tit comb  have been close  friends since  high school  and the pair  often get together  to golf and dine  when the president  visits the state  of Hawaii  so  the president  last met tit comb  during the first  family's Christmas  and New Year's  holiday  so they were  hanging out  very recently  Jim  yes they were  and he was  with one of  Obama's friends  that was with him  when he scattered  his grandmother's 
[01:02:30]  ashes in 2008  like they're real  friends from many  many years  real close  yeah look  the guy  wants to get  a blowjob  who cares  now if you're  Obama  do you have to  you know  blow off this  friendship for  the rest of  your political career  you just have to  probably keep a lid  on it  like you gotta  be careful  with it  gotta get busted  but you know  they'll be friends  forever  yeah if it was a  kid you have to  leave them forever  but a prostitute  come on  so that's  that's a biggie  today  yeah  you haven't found  the picture yet  no I'm just  kind of  I'm just kind of  perusing  as we speak 
[01:03:00]  because he really  is not happy  in the photo  at all  and neither is  the other guy  Brent Spiner  wasn't pleased  with me either  imagine if he  had known  you were about  to shake his  hand  he had no idea  imagine if he  knows what I've  done in my  life  you guys have  a good time  with these  things huh  I gotta go to  one  we're going  again in  August  can I go  July  of July  I thought it was  August  Comic Con  where is it  San Diego  oh you guys  are going all  the way out  there  there's a  chiller theater  in April  yeah I want  to go to  one of the  local ones  where's that  that's Jersey  in Persephone  April what

[01:12:30]  word lozenge and  belch over and  over last night  because it drives  my wife nuts  that's what you  should do but  then my my uh  my son who's  almost 11 months  now was fucking  laughing his ass  off because because  i think he already  knows that i bother  people and he  really likes that  i'm telling you i  think he's picking  up on that  probably is  picked up the  kids and then i  decided because you  know i'm from long  island originally i'd  like to say i'm a  long islander but the  fact is i've been in  the city about nine  years now and uh i  was uh i was talking 
[01:13:00]  about the serial killer  right before we went  to bed which i guess is  a bad thing to do i  didn't realize that  maybe because she was  really freaked out and  scared and uh she  goes thanks a lot now  i'm scared right and  right at that moment  there was a huge crash  in my apartment and  all the lights are  off and we're in  bed she jumps the  fuck up she goes  what the hell was  that and even i even  i'm thinking wow i  don't know she grabs  my son and i'm gonna  protect our son mode  and makes me wander the 
[01:13:30]  the apartment to see  what the fucking  noise was i'm not  gonna lie to you i  was a little fucking  nervous about it  turns out it was a  uh um a curtain rod  fell down in one of  the bathrooms you  should have acted  like you're struggling  call the police  there's a negro  that's right  hey if you don't  go get that curtain  rod who will  yeah yeah  but that's like  curtain rod to the  ground  not a great ending to  the story  but you know i had 
[01:14:00]  to be a man last  night and and check  out the apartment  what room was that  curtain rod in  it was in the  bathroom  fucking a the  bathroom  in the bathroom  did you pick it  up i sure did  someone had to  i sure did  holy shit  and then i show  today and then i  and then i went  back into the  bedroom and i had  my chest out i said  yeah it's just a  curtain rod that  fell down i felt  like a man last  night jimmy why  do we have to go  search out the  noises though i guess  the reason why i'm  bringing this to our  our show today why 
[01:14:30]  the fuck do we have  to do that i don't  disagree we're the  heroes huh we're the  heroes i'm fucking  just as scared of that  stupid noise as  anyone else what  also i had to get  up i wouldn't have  gotten up huh i  wouldn't have gotten  up you would just  no what what would  you have done just  laid in bed in fear  i would have said  what is that small  thing you're holding  i have no kids i  would have yelled  at this person you're  holding that baby  get in yeah there's  a baby in here the  both of you leave  immediately and take 
[01:15:00]  that murderer with you  on the way out it  was weird timing man  maybe my dad was  visiting as a ghost  oh no he probably  he would have  probably tickled  the baby would  have knocked a  curtain rod over  stop making a  mess yeah exactly  my dad believed in  um the afterlife he  really he really dug  all that shit and i and  when i knew he was on  his last leg i i had a  talk with him i said  look man when your  time comes do not  fucking visit me as a  ghost i'm not even  joking i i had this  conversation with him  you could give me 
[01:15:30]  signs you could get  it like uh like uh  something in the in  the sky but do not  fucking visit me as a  ghost and think it's  it's gonna be cool  and so far he has  unless unless he pulled  down the uh the  curtain rod last night  the shower curtain  rod i don't think he  would do that just  yeah just a mess for  a mess's sake there's  no reason for him  just to knock a  curtain rod over in  the bathroom except to  freak you out and  that's like was he a  prankster my dad was  he a prankster not  really no yeah so so 
[01:16:00]  but uh yeah i'm i  had to get up last  night the timing was  weird because we were  talking about the  serial killer yeah  that's up to eight  eight victims on long  island yeah it's  creepy right off ocean  parkway which is a very  popular road for all  the beach people and  they'll use they all  know it they'll use it  to go after craigslist  for prostitution because  that's where he met  them but the reality is  they're eventually  going to catch him  because of it some  computer mistake  something he did  but what i don't  understand is they're  looking for this one  broad that they assume 
[01:16:30]  is dead and they have  found her yet so she  would be the ninth  victim and she was  the one i think that  was running away from  someone's house because  she was freaked out so  whose house was that  and who's the guy  they'll eventually get  him because of this  that that's what i don't  understand unless i i  missed it in the in all  the stories that are  coming out well how'd  they know she was  running away from a  house it's documented a  neighbor or somebody  else saw this woman  freaking out i think she  was even you know doing  the famous help me you  know this is a there's a  whack job oh wow chasing me 
[01:17:00]  from one of these houses  so i would assume it's  gotta be one of those  houses in that area where  the serial killer is  hanging out fuck man  where on long island is  that like how far from  the city and it's in  between um jones beach  and robert uh moses on  ocean parkway towards the  city or away 45 miles  east of yeah it's out  there it's out there and  they're all long island  girls i don't know i  don't think so i mean i  mean it's like they all  hooky on craigslist in  long island i don't know i  think they've come from 
[01:17:30]  some uh different places  unless they were living in  the new york area because  you wonder if he's bringing  them there or if he's uh  getting them and killing  them on island right but  if they know this one  prostitute was running  away from someone that was  really fucking creepy and  scary that then then why  don't they have a suspect  they will that's how they  do they will look they  caught that fucking philip  markham who killed  himself which was great uh  who's that i don't know he  was the craigslist killer in  boston oh right right  killed uh yes yes yes 
[01:18:00]  and uh god what a weird  thing for his fiancee  that's supposed to be  married and he gets pulled  over and all of a sudden  there was a body in the  trunk right no no no no no  he had a gun but they  traced him through his  phone through craigslist  okay um uh emails to the  girl he was supposed to  rob her and she screamed  and he killed i think he  wasn't a serial killer he  panicked it was a robbery  gun right right right but  that's how they got him was  fucking through tracing the  emails jesus so craigslist  will eventually get this  guy caught if he keeps  it up uh it's not like i 
[01:18:30]  was giving fatherly  advice didn't it if he  keeps it up walter in  connecticut what's up  walter i hope uh to go  on youtube and check out  uh baby versus king cobra  the cobra is defanged but  it's some third world  third world entertainment  bullshit and they're just  grooming this kid to think  he can grab whatever he  wants and uh yay yeah i  didn't know that you could  take the fangs out of the  cobras now i mean because  there's a lot of these  cool cobra uh videos online 
[01:19:00]  look at this this little  fucking baby i would guess  the baby's about uh six  seven months old cobra  right in front of him and  he's just touching the  cobra cobra's like what the  fuck so that's why they get  that's why they get away  with all these videos these  these cobras have no fangs  but is the cobra gonna bite  him anyway like even with  nothing on there what is  he gonna gum him to death  oh he just did he bit his  head he bit his head and  nothing right  he got no teeth  you know what a dick to  cobra must feel like  the kids don't call in  he's like what the fuck  yeah can you imagine being 
[01:19:30]  a cobra without fangs that's  he did it again he bit the  kid's head twice  yeah it won't even leave a  mark  can't even take out a baby  walter it's a good video  oh look at that  but i'm kind of i'm kind of  bummed now that i know that  they take the fangs out  yeah  doing the third time  uh one more thing real  quick  yeah  uh bill burr he's got a bit  about um you know the guy  that the guy always has to go  check for the noise like you  know he's uh you know  bulletproof or something like  that  and uh you know women's lib  it's you gotta you gotta look at 
[01:20:00]  his hbo special it's a good  bit it was really really funny  i i uh i remember that one  hopefully we have it we can  play it into break  yeah because i don't i i  yeah well who am i at you  know you go check for the  fucking noise that cobra bit  that kid like eight times and  then the kid just kind of  grabbed him by like the neck  and the cobra wrapped around  the kid and started biting  his head  now i gotta fucking tweet that  god  twitter all fucking day long  now  there's a sexy photo it's a  woman holding a giant  someone emailed it to me a 
[01:20:30]  long time ago  some chick  there's a giant snake she's  holding  her and her boyfriend there's  somebody in the park has a  snake and so she squats down  to hold the snake and her  legs are open  and and uh her pussy is  showing and her boyfriend took  the picture  and her pussy is massive  she's the biggest pussy lips  i've ever seen  i don't know if it's a porn  chick it's obviously a setup  right  but the way it looks in the  park it really looks like  like she's squatting with her  legs open does anybody know  that photo

[01:35:00]  then you got to encourage it and really  make it hurt so the video comes out you  know it's viral well it's cute and uh  this one they're driving and and the  kids crying hysterically because he  wants to be the governor of new jersey  and the kids what four or five i think  and i said it at the time we played the  clip we made fun of it we laughed and i  said that was here too i believe he he  was on board and uh i said they're gonna  make him governor for a day this is how  this plays out and and sure enough 
[01:35:30]  yesterday he was an honorary governor of  new jersey this is what they're doing  probably didn't have the ability to  commute death sentences he did he did oh  yeah he did some crazy stuff as governor  they should have made him a governator like  he said what's the nigga that's not fair  you know my role on the chip thing and  you're you're it's not fair it's not fair  to me we're friends it's not fair this is i  don't acknowledge you and everyone else  does but now i have to acknowledge it  because there's no one else around i know  you did this on purpose i just snuck in the 
[01:36:00]  house you did this on purpose i fucking  we bonded when bob kelly goes i fucking  hate chip it's one of my favorite things  he does every time and i just make  believe he didn't talk because bob hates  him you know that chip is smarter than  bob i'll break it down when you first  brought chip to the show i fucking hated  it i don't even know why so my whole  thing because i'm a fucking asshole i  said i'm just not gonna acknowledge he's  doing that character and it'll it'll go  away and it never went away but then it  became the thing for me to not 
[01:36:30]  acknowledge it and then to be honest i  love chip but but i already played it  one way that and i'm trying to  continue to play it that way chip is  undiscourageable because he doesn't  understand how awful he is he's  undiscourageable he understood how like  if chip understood being ignored he  would understand how awful his jokes are  right but he doesn't right right you  know that's why i try to barrel through  and go on to something else like a  barrel of monkeys or something see but i  can't do that bit today because there's  no one else to play you know play the  other role here's the clip jimmy i'm 
[01:37:00]  surprised you didn't see it uh oh he's  three years old three-year-old really  wants to be governor of new jersey i hate  this hacky shit that people do so of  course they made him the governor for  the day here's the original clip  because i want to be the governor and i  can't why can't you be the governor  because you're small and i want to  who's the governor of california

[01:43:00]  light and went zeppelin you feel bad now  because you know the zeppelin took all  their shit no i don't feel bad a little  bit it's like like in a comic and you  find that they stole everything like  oh really yeah i don't know i don't know  it seemed like it was more accepted back  then or something or harder to trace but  know what it made me do is start checking  out willie dixon and some of those old  school blues guys you don't like the  blues though i don't hate it it's okay  like i like lead belly but the blues for me  is like you know it's black black music 
[01:43:30]  and i don't mean that like i don't like  black music but it tells a story that  thank you that i'm not uh it gets not my  life it gets a little repetitive at times  but i like that i i was thinking about  this yesterday when i was walking around  i like i like uh i like i realized i like  dirt on everything and how i explain this  when ronnie b was talking about the  stones and stuff and i forgot who oh you  said you've never seen the stones right live  yeah and he said you're going to be very 
[01:44:00]  disappointed because now the stones when  you see it it's so over the top corporate  and polished everything is perfect and i i was  thinking about that when i was walking  around yesterday what ronnie said i said you  know what he just explained my life i i like  i like dirt on everything i don't that's  why i don't like the perfect porn girls when  they come in here i like i like them to be a  little like a you know what i mean a  little dirt not not imperfections yeah not  uh over the top polished you know i i hate  videos that are all nice and polished i just 
[01:44:30]  like it to look a little gritty and i like  that in my music too well thank you before  anybody calls up and says that i know i  don't dislike the blues but i don't know rock  came from the blues oh we know where it  comes from the blue i know oh the point i'm  making with this thank you bringing it back  to the blues and then you you know some of  the blues that it comes out today is too  polished you know i like here the crackling  because the recordings were uh you know  yeah they're old and and you could just  tell they're messing up a little bit and  their voices are just a little shot i love 
[01:45:00]  that i love that in music i love that in  my in my life i think half of them were on  heroin you know those old blues players  were all oh i'm sure booze or something i'm  sure they had something going on let  belly was interesting just because he was  such a you know guy did stints in prison  and he sang his way out of jail like that  can only happen in the 40s right you  know but he like he sang for the  fucking warden yeah i want juice what kind  of juice we're doing today none of that  beat shit because it makes it look like  you're bleeding from your asshole what do  you got whatever you would like gh we're

[01:48:00]  type of herpes as long as it's not on  your dick no yeah i just uh i i bought  some blistex today it said satisfaction  guaranteed on the phone all that shit  doesn't work that doesn't work blistex on a  herpes i've been through all that since i was  eight years old you take fucking lysine i  want to know why i got the herp and i'm not  the not the bad one someone just because  what kenny has is officially the herp do  you guys both have in the same spot did we i get 
[01:48:30]  it in the same spot like every two years  or so that means you got a weak uh a weak  upper lip so the the virus pops out there  i got a weak upper lip a weak chin a big  nose a profile like a half moon the funniest  line ever was jay moore said you look like  an angel fish that's the best by far so  the blistex is working for you i don't  know i just got it this morning it said  satisfaction gallery it feels nice it'll  tingle give you that nice tingly feeling  but it's not going to heal shit and i also

[02:04:30]  doing a show tomorrow i think we might  take tomorrow off the fuck they want  from us we take all bill hicks guys are  here yes yeah we could talk to them next  can i do the john sterling thing real  fast though yeah yeah going in a break  um john sterling the the fucking yankee  announcer who does the home run calls uh  this is the year of the home run call  with this guy for some reason there's  even more attention on his home run calls  this year than there were last year so  this fucking thing's taking off and  we're only bringing the new ones to the  show because you've heard the the basic 
[02:05:00]  ones over the years uh he he did one for  russell martin it's the most douche chilly  thing i think i've ever heard in sports  it stinks and uh and here it is for uh for  martin russell martin come on now the two  two swung on and hit in the air to deep  left bosch back that ball is high hit as far  and it's gone russell martin drives one  near the left center field bullpen a long 
[02:05:30]  three-run home run and i would stop it  right there right and then give the score  right that's exactly it that's perfect i like  that home run call that wasn't bad i think  he's a good play-by-play guy that was  fine but then russell has muscle and the  yankees take a 9-3 lead why can't you just  go and that makes it 9-3 because it's all  about him russell has muscle that sucks  and then uh we got another one uh andrew  jones i didn't know the yankees picked 
[02:06:00]  him up isn't he kind of a bum at this  point you play with the braves right yeah  he's a bench player he is a bench player  the payoff swung on there goes to deep  left it is high it is far it is gone  andrew jones it's a line drive bullet in  the left field seats andrew jones makes  his bones he drives his first yankee home  run into the seats and the yankees take a  four nothing lead makes his bones jimmy's 
[02:06:30]  biting his teeth that's impossible it's  just corny who the fuck enjoys that he  admitted that he was not ready for andrew  jones to hit a home run then how about you  don't try how about you just say okay there  you go do a real call right you don't  have to make everything about you with  the home run does anybody like it do  we've done nothing but attack that for  five years i've never heard anybody say  they think it's funny or good i don't  know i read some of the sports pages and  uh they're not killing them too much  over this here and there but yeah i'd be 
[02:07:00]  all over it if i was uh one of those  sports writers but no they're pretty much  letting them slide all right all right  seth in chicago that's the bit though how  do you bite your own teeth exactly that's  how bad it is that jimmy's attempting to  bite his own teeth uh you want to do uh  sparkling wiggles into break sure another  kid video that did very well it's all about  the kid videos today you got the that  little three-year-old he was the governor 
[02:07:30]  of new jersey for the day then you had the  red sox fan telling his son he can't be  a yankees fan and uh this is this is  certainly the uh the classic one as we  go to break  sparking wiggles at the party  no no sparking wiggles here  get a job sparkling wiggle  go be a suck suck

[02:10:00]  people just coming and going  hopefully it sounds like something out  there uh we got david tell kind of  walking down the hall slowly looking like  he's gonna break into someone's home  jimmy's in the bathroom and we got the  bill hicks guys here so and i just got my  bill hicks t-shirt which uh thumbs up yeah 
[02:10:30]  you gotta pull the mic down sir so who do we  got in the studio what's up jimmy the bill  hicks guys to your right i know we just  we're just coming back on it's mad and uh  paul and and david tell what's up david  walking into how are you sir what did i  walk in on well i just came back from  break we just got back dave and we're  going to talk to uh these guys who made  a uh a film about bill hicks did you know  bill hicks uh yes i did you did uh i met 
[02:11:00]  him twice um and i saw him perform at the  old improv in new york city and it was  great because um this was in the late  80s when uh hacks ruled the comedy world  like you needed a guitar or a puppet and  uh it's not like today where you just need  you know i guess uh dry irony yeah dry  irony or a goddess and uh today uh it was  great because uh the club owner at the  time was like i don't get this guy get  him off really and then they brought out 
[02:11:30]  the next guy doing the clapper joke  jesus christ that's what i got who was  the guy that didn't get bill hicks  tim allen no i don't know it was uh it  was the club owner of the uh of the how  did he not get bill hicks that did he  make people uncomfortable well he was uh  because he wasn't like joke joke joke  guy he was dark and that was like uh you  know the late 80s people didn't want that  right right right it was a different uh  different time and he probably didn't  get him because if the crowd wasn't  enjoying it anything the crowd's not  enjoying the club owner won't enjoy but  the crowd was going crazy the club owner 
[02:12:00]  would have loved it they don't care what  the comic's doing as long as the crowd  likes it well he obviously was a very  funny guy very smart guy a very dark guy  like david tell said one of the things  that uh yeah some of the comedians had  said that we spoke to was that bill kind  of taught them some of the younger guys  coming up that you shouldn't be afraid to  walk the room like you're going out there  with your material and that if they are  not getting it and that you don't feel  like um you want to change and make them  happy right and do what you want to do  and be prepared to have them leave well  that's that's easy for him to say but if  you're an up-and-coming guy if you're if 
[02:12:30]  you're not getting the job done then you  don't get uh ass backed that was before  twitter you know right you know people  walked out they went out into their  whatever their rest of their lives now  you know it never ends and hicks though  the thing with hicks though and i'm not  even a guy who followed hicks but i like  the fact that i think when he would walk  a room at least it was sincere like people  who say who've seen hicks a million they  said that he fucking he was just doing  his act and people didn't like it they  are offended by the religious stuff is when  you see guys trying to walk the room 
[02:13:00]  you know they're trying to emulate hicks  and it doesn't come off as genuine but i  think the fact that he would walk them  with his act is important it's a big  difference i'm a huge fan of bill hicks  but uh huge fan of comedy in general love  these guys and all i uh bill hicks was  one of those guys i never got to see  well really yeah just on fucking tape but  and you know his uh comedy cds i just  wanted to say like uh the second time i  met him since uh thanks for that  follow-up the second time we met him was  after like another show where like once 
[02:13:30]  again the crowd didn't get him and uh i  don't think no people knows about bill  hicks but like he was like a master  guitar player like he's from texas and uh  i guess it's like the you know uh  something in the in the water down there  but he was just like an amazing guitar  player and we were hanging out at guy's  house everybody smoking pot and he's  like hey is that a guitar you know he was  sober at this point and he uh he's  like uh can i use that guitar for a second  and he picks it up he's just like jamming  on the guitar you're like oh my as a young  comic you're like not only is he a great  comic he's like like this otherworldly  being he's like so talented you know and 
[02:14:00]  uh then he complimented me on one of my  jokes he gave me a tag oh wow what was  the what was the tag um he said uh put  some cream on it no he had a great uh you  know just like comedy mind so that like  made me like i was like floating on air  right he was like even listen to one of  my jokes but he definitely was the guy  who i think a lot of these people like  jim said they emulate they want to be  him but i don't think they have the  same rage and anger and they also don't  have the same uh street cred that he did  because he worked a lot of uh are you  allowed to curse again yeah yeah he worked 
[02:14:30]  like some of the shittiest b-room club  like hardcore like you know alabama you  know whatever shreveport you know like  just basically down and dirty beer hall  kind of places a lot of these other guys  who were you know supposedly these uh you  know um truth-telling you know comic  storyteller people they work like la they  work here they work south by southwest  you know they work like three or four  different places and you know he was  definitely out there for years and years  and years where people like talk about  the crowd walking walking the crowd like  the crowd was like viciously angry they 
[02:15:00]  wanted to fight him after every show so  yeah and it's like there's like a guy  who speaks like there's a truth to power  you know it's like what a lot of guys  today don't realize is the things that  were considered rebellious a lot of times  when bill was doing them which is i  guess in what the uh the late 70s early  80s when he when he was you know when  did he perform what were his years of  performing into the 90s 90s yeah um  movie right that's us yeah okay they're  not necessarily the same things that are  rebellious today so a lot of guys would 
[02:15:30]  like they do the type of stuff build it  but it's like they're like you said it's  not real their their rage it's just  they're trying to like manufacture what a  guy like that created it's weird he's  been gone a while now and his stuff  isn't dated you can put on his comedy  cds and it makes sense with what's  going on in the world today we get a  lot that we get that a lot of people  come in contact with us and say we  didn't know he was dead oh really  having just discovered him like you  know seeing him on youtube where can i  go and see this guy  now how did you guys did you guys know  or how did you get involved with this  project that's called american uh the 
[02:16:00]  bill hicks story well yeah i mean as  you can tell we're a couple of brits by  our plummy accents and um as you might  know bill was really really big and he  got yeah he got huge in uh yeah in  britain and uh kind of frustrated he  wasn't as big in america but he also  did very well in canada was his  breakout performances at montreal just  for last in 91 and then in australia  he did a very big tour over there so  there are certain you know places that  he's really well known and obviously in  places like austin over here in the us  where you've got like you know big big  followings a question for the room not  just you guys why do you think he  didn't get big in america because we 
[02:16:30]  suck over here we don't appreciate  anything until he he obviously had his  following but i mean he was selling  out he was selling out theaters and in  this movie you talk about it where he  would he'd come back from selling out  theaters all over europe and then come  home to like uh dave uh said to these  uh shitty comedy clubs but at that time  we'd had we'd had that kind of not  bill's kind of comedy but we'd had a  you know alternative comedy on tv for  several years by then yeah i mean it  was just kind of a different climate  also because the uk is much smaller if  someone's a big splash at the edinburgh  comedy festival where bill first 
[02:17:00]  appeared then the whole country gets to  hear about it right whereas the states  is so huge right you know these guys  were really well known in houston but  weren't known in new york or la now were  you guys hired to do this project or  you or it was your idea you know walk  us through this a little bit yeah we  developed it i mean basically we were  lucky enough um on the 10th  anniversary of bill's death to have some  contact with his family so basically  there were tribute nights going on  around the world which is kind of  unprecedented if you think about it  i mean i don't know many other  comedians who have tribute nights for  them right we were doing the london one  we got in touch with bill's family we  certainly will have one for jimmy 
[02:17:30]  yeah exactly yeah we just have a great  jiraldo yeah yeah yeah jiraldo was a great  comic man  and um so what happened was that we put  right  did you guys know greg or no uh no we  didn't know they didn't we saw greg when  we we did that we did a movie preview at  the gotham a few years ago i met greg oh  okay he was uh he was a pretty bright  fucking comic man i liked him i have a  question yeah uh england you brought it  up it was so true that like we we  usually don't get like how good something  is until it goes you know he he basically i  remember when he went to england for the 
[02:18:00]  first time bill hicks and he uh uh you  know that's when all the great reviews  started coming out when you guys finally you  know kind of saw the genius in it and uh i  think a lot of it had to do with you guys  were cooler with the rage that he really  had against the government and like society  and commercialism and all that kind of  stuff and uh i guess the guy who i always  consider the kind of heir apparent uh to bill  would be uh doug stanhope and i and i know he's  also very big in in um in england so i think 
[02:18:30]  he's over there now touring is doug big in england  yes yeah yeah no he plays uh the leicester square  theater quite often which is a big room and um you  know he gets invited back a lot because he  has that same fire i think he has that same  commitment which maybe means that you're not  always like knocking out one liners every sort  of two or three minutes that you're actually  exploring a subject and you're not afraid to go  there and i think that's why people respond to him sure  so like me too because i'm very angry about like  game shows and things like that  well i'm just basically  well it's amazing how like we send over these  amazing comics and then you guys send over these 
[02:19:00]  guys to do these movies that these like you know  katherine heigl um whatchamacallit seth rogany  movies and uh we watch them on planes going  towards your country you know what i'm saying  what do you guys think about that yeah basically  it's not it's not fair we're sorry all  right so i thought i could start a nice yeah i  know  so it's too good so you ran into the family at a  10-year uh death reunion thing uh well the family  were obviously over in the states but um that was our first contact with them  and then we spent a couple of years not only getting to know them and 
[02:19:30]  trying to gain their trust but and to prove that we were the right guys to  make the film but also exploring how we were going to put it together  because you know as you said bill wasn't someone who would maybe get  money thrown at a project about him over in the states and that's kind of  why it came from the uk yeah i i wanted to see this movie for a while  because i i heard about it and i was like how are they going to pull this off  because there's not a lot of video bill hicks i mean there's a lot of  performance video obviously a lot of great specials though yeah but not  him just hanging out if you're doing a documentary you don't have them  you know just chilling so you you guys made it work by uh doing a lot with 
[02:20:00]  pictures photographs you want to explain that a  little bit and where you got the idea um well when we first uh got to know the  family and and did some research there were there were just so many  photographs of bill he'd collected a lot through his career he'd kept all of those  you know vhs tapes from the comedy clubs but also just photos from friends and  and photo shoots um and they kind of just showed the picture because the  thing about bill is he evolved so much through his life and you can see that  going from you know the young cult right through several stages in his life 
[02:20:30]  um and we'd seen this film called kids stays in the picture which had kind of  done a bit of 3d photography yeah that was a good film man yeah it's  fantastic film yeah and what it does is it takes you into that world you're not  watching talking heads on a screen cut with clips you go back into that world  right but we realized you could take it a lot further and so and rebuild the  the real locations so that's bill's real childhood home when they're sneaking out  to go down to the comedy club against their parents permission and then we  rebuilt the the the comedy club where bill and the the other 
[02:21:00]  oh cool comics in houston used to perform um the club the comics annex which was  part of the comedy workshop there did you uh do any of the laugh stop uh any of  those clubs like that because houston it was a really huge comedy town the uh  dirty did you guys talk about this the texas dozen you know jimmy pineapple  the texas outlaw comics yeah they're all featured in the film  yeah yeah and uh riley barber and all those did you talk to all of that  absolutely yeah that's great john farnetti is actually in town tonight for our  premiere tomorrow um and uh obviously jimmy pineapple now james laboreau and 
[02:21:30]  annie huggins they were kind of the guys he'll always be known as jimmy  pineapple to me yeah by the way jimmy james pineapple esquire yeah no you're  right you're right but what the great thing about those guys was that they  kind of um they got to bill at the right age he was 17 or 18 he walks into this  comedy club and he finds them and they basically bring  him on as a performer and they also teach him about drinking and drugs and  girls as well but they taught him about what it meant to be a performer and  what that um entailed was you know being true to who you were as a person and 
[02:22:00]  not being afraid to go and explore topics that were interesting and so  that he met them at the right time they kind of nurtured him and brought him  along and you know they were lifelong friends  and and he hit right at 17 and 18 he was killing he was a killer act he  definitely i saw him one time at the uh what's the not the cafe one new york  but used to be like on like we're dealing underground the village underground one  time and he was shooting a special there and the crowd didn't get him  because i think it was like salsa night and then he came out  it was really like one of those weird kind of situations and like they  weren't getting him and he was shooting a special and this was like i guess uh you 
[02:22:30]  know just like something they threw together and he immediately like went  from like uh you know i'm doing the prepared  material to rage which i love and uh he just had so many great like quick  one-liners just from his many years of road stuff  which separates him immediately from these alternative comics which is like i  think a lot of them don't have that like kind of road like you know able to  work a situation you know it's like they're perform like it's a performance art  thing but he was like a comic you know in his soul so he could definitely  handle it but uh i'm glad that you guys are doing this because uh 
[02:23:00]  he definitely is underrated and he's also uh as more important in comedy than  a lot of people think i mean you can tell us this though i mean a lot of  comedians as i understand it like look at other comics up on the stage and say  that they can see how many hours they've done they can see how many nights just  by how crafted they are you know and obviously bill was doing like 207 when  he was sober um and he was working all the time he was doing 275 nights a  year and so you look at the guy up on stage and you just can see his mastery of an  audience you can see his comfortableness there you can see his craft and and also 
[02:23:30]  that the one-liners and the put downs are part of that too but it's about the  ability to kind of like move around any subject matter that you want and like  just sort of pull it all together was there other bill hicks guys at the time  dave or was he like one of the only you know you know i mean not  it was bill hicks um let's see bob zaney  but were there any other guys that were kind of going dark when bill hicks was  doing it kinnison was fairly dark kinnison was  yeah and and and and they were both in houston at the same time right  yeah they were they were actually mental uh you know sam was you know sort of 
[02:24:00]  almost a mentor to bill at a younger age he's to perform with him but it seems like sam might  have bit off uh bill hicks that's a good question but i uh what i never got to see  sam live but i have seen bill sam live holy shit i never got to see it and uh  the more i do comedy the more i realize that's the that's uh the reason why you get into  comedy which is what sam kinnison was doing which not not not the later time with the rock and roll  with the ever but when he was like before all the celebrity hit he was like there was nobody who 
[02:24:30]  brought that much energy but both high and low on stage the way he did it he was an imposing figure  but yet everybody walked out of there even if he was screaming in their face they still felt like  they had a great time they were like they didn't feel you know like it was like a horrible experience  but he was he was an amazing performer so i think he also was another guy who was underrated you  you know and i think a lot of it had to do with like the drugs and like partying and and uh you  know the rock star lifestyle it was kinnison and he worked it i know hicks was one of those guys  and he used to tour when i saw sam he toured with alan stevens carl lebeau and mitch walters i 
[02:25:00]  think were the guys in front of him oh was jimmy one of those guys okay i believe so he's one of the  outlaws with kinnison yeah yeah well he's doing the amphitheater when he's doing the big tours you know  okay but like when you see him like uh supposedly like i never got to see him you know the you know  the guy i asked would be like mark marron because he like basically lived with those guys out in la  in the early 80s but uh when he would hit the comedy store in the uh early 80s he just ruled the place  and that was a really great place for like a lot of these young guys when i was doing comedy in the 
[02:25:30]  beginning it already the wave of comedy was over like the really cool wave so it was a lot of people  trying to be like uh the sweater comics you know the skip stevensons and whatever like the uh did you  you know have you ever thought about and a lot of lame ass observational stuff so that's why bill  hicks was definitely the standout and letterman got it they got it right away but then i always feel  like it said that like he didn't get a chance to like he should have been on there like more than he  was you know like every couple of weeks every couple of months or whatever he should have been a panel 
[02:26:00]  guest and you know we really would have gotten here i think they found the process of uh vetting which  obviously they do on on those shows and then you know the producer will go out see the act two or three  times take out jokes they don't like i think that bill found that uncomfortable sometimes and it's  horrible he had to go through it obviously to get on the show and then obviously i mean on the 12th  appearance so he was on 11 times and the 12th appearance which was about three four months before  he died was the one which was you know sort of famously canned and then letterman regretted that  and i don't like the fact he waited 25 years to play it and then dramatic he dramatically played it 
[02:26:30]  we should have played this a long time ago we're playing it tonight the day after his mom was there  out of respect bill's mom was there dave made a whole thing about it so he he didn't make good  i guess what was it religious stuff or something that whatever the material was that uh what was  the big problem not to do something what was it it was uh it was uh who was it wasn't billy ray cyrus was  it who there well there was a couple of things i think one one was kind of the uh the sort of the um  the nastiness of uh the perceived nastiness of of um offering to kill someone with a shotgun um and you know 
[02:27:00]  know who maybe was beloved um at the time and then the other stuff was um some uh apparently um you  know religious stuff about the pope or pro-life so you know there was a couple of they could  describe them as hot button topics right and you know it's the kind of thing that i think that you  know maybe they wouldn't you know think twice about today as dave said that's america he said you know  they're still fucking with comics oh god yeah you know you can look at these guys they have their own  stories so no they definitely uh they definitely vet vet your set and they um do have a lot of topics 
[02:27:30]  they don't want you to talk about and uh i don't know if that's true in england on your chat shows  or whatever but over here like you really have to like uh you know uh it's basically you do the  material they tell you to do i think one of the reasons that bill thought that he went over so  well in the uk you asked about that earlier was that uh you know he was able to do after this  montreal set was filmed they played it unedited on channel four an hour and ten minutes and there's  only four channels in the uk at that time and basically um you know a really good proportion of the  country just hooked into him and rarer and rarer nowadays it was a water cooler moment people 
[02:28:00]  next day were saying did you see that guy right and it really was a sort of a consciousness  attaining um performance sure and um i think that one of the things that you know he was lucky to do  as paul was saying was you know hitting channel four at the right time where they were looking for  people to push the boundaries they were looking for people who you know didn't give a about profanity  and that they were interested in someone who was really going to blow the socks off their  audience and that's what bill did at just the right time the vetting process is different over  there as well and you can pretty much do what you want on the show and and they then look who  complains afterwards so the show don't decide so much and then over over time it's called balls 
[02:28:30]  yeah no kidding uh america the bill hicks uh story i yeah i really enjoyed this damn uh  documentary it's it's it's well done these guys did a great job at the pictures and stuff  they handed us these cards by the way i thought it was a menu what is this well this is this is a  bill hicks menu for the soul it's called bill hicks's principles of comedy well this is uh sorry you  don't have one yeah it's printed out and posted by bill on the wall at the laughing skull in atlanta 
[02:29:00]  is that around still or no that's still there yes laughing club yes oh by the way uh that's the  best thing when you go to these when you go to comedy clubs like i'm going to raleigh they have  all the great uh they have all the great old headshots and bill like he started when he was like 15 or  something like that so he's got like the baby headshot then he's got like the bad boy headshot but his his uh  every time i see it i always give it a little tap because uh he is great the amazing thing for  us though coming over here as two brits is obviously we've got this film that we we think  people should know about who bill is and that he's somebody who's important in terms of like 
[02:29:30]  the american cultural timeline what we've been amazed by is how the american comedic community  has come out to support the film so we're working here in new york with uh gotham with eastville  with upright citizens brigade in la we're doing a screening for the comics only at the comedy  store which is going to be amazing and then we have paul provonza who's going to be  hosting our premiere in la and then the next night bob weed director of curb enthusiasm the  next night colin hanks so we have some really nice people coming out to support the film and  essentially showing that that they do know who bill was and that they feel that other people should know 
[02:30:00]  who the hell he was too what's what's the tool connection with uh manor you didn't really get  into that with the film bill and maynard were friends and um how do they meet i don't know actually  um but i do remember a gag that bill did they he opened for tool a couple of times and one of them was  them he said he'd lost his contact lens in the mosh pit can anyone have a look for it um but the  idea i think was that they just found each other interesting and so you know tool um asked bill to  support them um on a tour and he managed to do a couple of gigs but not a full tour really loves 
[02:30:30]  bill hicks yeah and obviously they featured him on i think three songs on their album three of their  songs are basically bill hicks's routine what's the how do you say music arizona bay no no the other  one uh anemia yeah anemia anemia is that is it anemia's name of the song or no i don't think  it's anemia is it that's the album right yeah yeah that that's fucking album's great and there's a  lot of bill hicks featured on that damn thing not to backtrack but the uh you know we're talking about  the montreal comedy festival that's where he broke the only other guy ever to break his hard would  have been uh mitch hedberg because he was another guy who left uh montreal with uh just like raves and 
[02:31:00]  well deservedly and he also to my in my my experience he mastered the letterman spot better  than anybody else because that is a hard hard thing jim knows it like doing like a six minute  set like we said it's vetted it's prepared you know and like his material is so clean but so so  different that like just every joke just blew the audience away so well i'm an opc in the film i  mean basically one of the things that runs throughout the film is that idea about what it 
[02:31:30]  means to be a comedian and and part of that is choices that you make about what you do with  your material and whether you're able to do a five minute clean spot and whether that makes you happy  or not right and and obviously some people like bill just were you know not um considered um five  minute comics by himself um and said well okay i need to work longer form and how do i do that and  if tv is not going to let me then that's the way that's going to be yeah but he still was great in in  the short form because he had great jokes i mean he had amazing jokes and when you watch him on the young  comedian special you know he held his own unfortunately that was like uh you know the special i'm talking 
[02:32:00]  about rodney dangerfield yeah yeah nothing goes right and uh who else was on that special because  that's like a dice clay dice clay and uh was hicks on dice special i didn't know that and also um  wow shimmel barry's comic was barry sobel on that one too there was another guy with leather a leather  jacket i remember the dice argued with him because dice wanted to wear the leather there was one guy  after him i went down my rara too wow i don't remember i would love to see that lineup see if someone could 
[02:32:30]  look it up look up that lineup specials you're probably right yeah i'm not sure the thing that  was really upsetting to bill though was that obviously he'd gone on and thought he had his  big break and um you know obviously um dice clay comes out with the you know the rude limericks  and you know he he got all the praise and all the attention after that special and bill thought it  was his big break and that he was gonna you know go go big and it just you know he got eclipsed on that  night well i think uh the cool thing about it is uh who has the last laugh huh and who does probably  dice but that was so sad because people thought bill hicks like i always thought he was way older 
[02:33:00]  than me he was only like a couple years older than me he died when he's 32 which is like really it was  like just as he was hit you know like yeah it it is a great topic for a movie that's well overdue i  think the interesting thing is that um you know we've been speaking to a lot of people for example john  la from the new yorker magazine who's written really nicely about bill and um you know he considers bill  to be the direct antecedent of people like john stewart and stephen colbert who are now doing that  kind of material but actually finding an audience on tv um and i think the you know the thing 
[02:33:30]  that's most interesting about it is that you know you have uh the ability to get an audience um  thinking about you know not just political stuff but satirical stuff um and you're doing it now on  a nightly basis to two three million people and that's something that you know at the time bill  was actually up for political correctness like bill maher's like first tv show um so at that time  you know he was he was almost in one of those chairs who did he look up to bill hicks who was who  was his guy i'm gonna guess carlin i mean who were his guys who he admired uh woody allen oh oh 
[02:34:00]  really yeah um and um he went all the way back to chaplin and then he was obviously very enamored  of richard prior when he saw the uh you know live on sunset strip kind of really blew him away how could  he not be and then that's that's one of the best specials ever no i think live in concert was better  sunset strip was after he burned himself yeah but that's always really it was very deep when he stopped  saying nigger that was like when he kind of made the proclamation i believe i wrote him you should  say it more but that's when he kind of said he would never say that again and you know he had like  an epiphany i guess yeah but don't we don't you think that like the crowds now are so politically 
[02:34:30]  correct that like i think they still wouldn't really get him bill hicks i i don't know what you guys  thoughts are on the actual like doing and seeing of coming but i think people really just want they  don't want to hear you know they they just want silliness and you know whatever personal  bullshit i don't know what do you think jim um i think a lot of things that like what is again what  is considered really going against the grain has changed a little in the last 15 or like it's a lot 
[02:35:00]  of you can make fun of the church a lot safer now it's not as big a deal anymore which they've kind  of brought on themselves and a lot of guys today are attacking the church like it's this act of  rebellion and it's like that's really not it's a bit different now if you're attacking islam  um or if you're going after race those are things that are very taboo today which may not have been  at one point so i don't know how he would do now because but he probably would have switched gears  and attacked other things but he yeah but he was from the south okay so he grew up in that culture  and then he would play these clubs like i said like it's easy to do a church joke at largo in uh 
[02:35:30]  right la but to do it in like some uh casino riverboat right in mississippi i mean like that's  real danger that's really like edgy uh you know like that's i believe in this and i don't give a  shit about the crowd and 20 years ago it was definitely a lot more dangerous than it is now  even i mean uh sure 20 years ago to be doing because again he wasn't a guy who needed uh i know there was  no alternative clubs back then yeah it's like guys who did that type of material back then just did it 
[02:36:00]  in front of comedy audiences it's like there was no i need my own crowd here it's like andy kaufman  he didn't do it in front of a hip alternative crowd right that would pretend they liked it whether  they did or not he did it for the fucking you know right rising star right right i thought he was a  fucking an idiot yeah let me uh go to the phones we got terry in uh erie pennsylvania we're talking  about the bill hicks documentary it's called american when is this being released guys uh it's uh opening  in new york uh cinema village uh tomorrow and it's going to be um out in la and then rest of the 
[02:36:30]  the country from the 15th so please check it out right on terry what do you got hey good morning  boys good morning i know uh bill and dennis leary were sputing for a little while over material did  they ever wind up patching things up before bill passed away or uh i believe that um the uh the  the leary situation is something that comes up a lot because we get asked about it in terms of like  you know did they didn't they and i think it's one of those things that is kind of um you know  between them in some ways whether they patched up or not we don't know but i think people do  know that bill was a little upset about it yeah obviously bill hicks came out with his album way 
[02:37:00]  before uh dennis leary and there's there's a lot of similar material man yeah absolutely and i think  that you know one of the things that comedians you know sort of some comedians are known for doing  people like robin williams as i understand it you know we're quite um cool with like people borrowing  bits off each other and stuff but i think the recording it and putting it down on an album that's  the bit that kind of hurt right and also the fact that it sold a million copies and you know got  dennis leary massive mtv viewership you know when bill was still playing the club so you know it hurt 
[02:37:30]  did you try to interview dennis no you didn't oh yeah i would have tried to interview him about it  why not well i guess because the way that the film came about was that we went to go and see bill's  family and friends and the uh the interviewees that we got like really really told the story and  it was kind of about the person behind the performer now now bill's uh dad is uh no longer with  us but the mom's still around what does she have to say about dennis leary well you can meet us she's  coming to town tomorrow night for the show does she talk about the dennis thing not really steve 
[02:38:00]  his brother mentions it a bit but but you know as well you know this far on how much would bill  really be worried about that sort of thing unless dennis was still copying him now right well although  steve did tell the um that cool joke when we were here in gotham like three years ago it was like why  does dennis leary have a career because there's no cure for cancer and steve told that and the audience  went whoa and it was like well no no he was kind of being funny i think they thought he was like making a  dig he wasn't he was just like steve steve spiel's brother it was brother who they think he was making  a dig at well i think they thought they thought he was like making some sort of like weird cancer 
[02:38:30]  reference but if he was it's his brother how about they let him do it this is why audiences should be  fucking executed that's a great line by the way it's a funny line yeah hicks was a very fucking edgy guy  and his brother does a cancer joke and they're like oh that's not polite the crowds just stink uh what  and they're there to tribute the guy the guy who they should know that yeah that's shitheads  sorry we apologize and steve doesn't do comedy right no no he was just up there you know as part  of the tribute it was yeah it's pretty obvious in your film that he didn't really uh he doesn't 
[02:39:00]  have the funny bone steve uh he's actually pretty good on stage it must suck to have a brother that's  just so far but yeah smart and funny the competition in in the family would have been yeah tough what  steve do for a living um well he used to work for a company um that basically marketed bands he was  like um what's the name of that company you work for it was like kind of the record big record store  across austin um and um yeah he's now uh you know working in grand rapids michigan there you go let  me say hi to jonathan in detroit jonathan hey how are you doing um welcome aboard 
[02:39:30]  uh just wanted to let you know there are four songs actually that tool did  that's related to bill hicks it's called third eye at the end of it kind of some trippy music  uh where he's going to stand up eulogy um hooker hooker with the penis and the cd is actually called  enema yeah the album's enema we fucked that up thank you wow all right thank you but that was the the set  that got him banned i remember there was two two bits that uh that that they didn't want to play one 
[02:40:00]  of them was like uh we have to kill it was like some country western guy no he's like no i want  you to go out there tonight and he's on tv doing a tv set and hunt him down and kill him let's turn  this into a game show i'm going to hunt billy ray cyrus i'm almost positive it was billy ray cyrus  so that was that was that was like definitely one of them i almost agree with him on that one  it's like oh you know you're gonna get the guy's fucking sued and here's the classic joke when you  remember like when all these reality tv shows came out like eliminate and all that kind of stuff 
[02:40:30]  which is like um if you're on tv desperately trying to get a joke take my just stay home and  masturbate and that's like when i you know the standards were like whoa can you say masturbate  on american television right right i don't know on english television you probably can say uh yeah  i think you can say wank wank yeah diddle the governor uh there's a lot of uh euphemisms over there  bill hicks principles i'm going to read one of these principles of comedy number one there's 12  if this is the first one if you can be yourself on stage nobody else can be you and you have the 
[02:41:00]  law of supply and demand covered wow so i don't agree with that i like to just emulate others  who have you chosen um just a few local guys this is what what a funny guy i i i couldn't think of  one guy to mention so i just said local guys what about the shucky guy hey so uh when bill got sick he  was gone within less than a year right uh he was diagnosed on uh in june and he was um uh you know 
[02:41:30]  gone by february the following year what what kind of cancer oh june to february oh pancreas is  horrible yeah and it was stage four i believe when it was diagnosed but it's you know it's an old  man's disease he's 32 i don't think but he had it in his family and he also uh the coolest thing  about it is i know a little bit about him too sorry fellas i love that you're here today  dave i didn't even know the smirking at me yeah you weren't sitting in a hotel in a red roof in  somewhere uh researching him anyway he started smoking again once he uh because he had quit and 
[02:42:00]  then he started smoking again said fuck balls yeah yeah pancreatic stage four you're fucking doomed  there's nothing you can do but at the same time uh you know bill did actually um felt he felt that he  might pull through and that he kind of saw it he called it his wake-up call not his death bell and  basically um you know as i'm sure dave knows you know like went on and recorded another two albums  after he was diagnosed so arizona bay and rantony minor yes were both released posthumously after  being engineered by kevin booth and were recorded in the last four months of his life wow so he just  turned the motor up and uh and he performed right right to the end right that's right the last gig of 
[02:42:30]  carolines right i heard that didn't finish but uh yes he was i heard the gig of carolines is deeply  depressing and he like like dave said he didn't finish he didn't finish what the set or the week  but everybody i know i believe the set yeah yeah early yeah sorry dave i'm sorry everybody i know  who was like i was gonna go see him but i figured i'd see him the next night and then he canceled and  it was like damn it was like the last time like elvis what was the first what how much time did you  on the last set do you know uh he did about 20 minutes and and then he kind of he was but he was 
[02:43:00]  on a lot of morphine and painkillers at that time so he didn't sell any merch sorry  again this was before merch handshakes back slapping did he tell the audience like i just  can't go uh he just um as i understand it um uh said i i can't go on and and uh walked off stage  yeah oh wow anyone have tape of that i'm sure you guys try yeah no there's definitely gonna be  some tape on that there's none well that's great but the last show that he was um recorded doing in  its entirety was a place called igby's which is in la right and um that was an amazing gig where he 
[02:43:30]  essentially kind of summed up not only what he was doing with his career he announced it when he  came on stage guys this is going to be my last gig you hear out my last ever gig maine from tools  in the audience and there's gasps people are going no what do you mean really and he just goes on to  dissect not only what he's been through over the last 16 years as a comedian attempting to try and  get real you know you know soul and spirit and voice out in america but also you know what the  american public have chosen which is gallagher and carrot top and basically um you know went off on 
[02:44:00]  this idea the audience is really his big mission was to try and get people to think for them  themselves and he felt that a lot of comedy a lot of comedians were attempting to stop audiences  thinking by distracting them and essentially what he was doing was attempting to try and get that  thinking muscle working did he really name carrot top poor carrot top he's such a nice guy  last gig and he attacks you we've had him on too he's all right he makes fun of himself at this point  so but that's but he's banking he looks like a nice person hey uh how when did he die after the uh  after that gig you just explained that was that was november of 93 and he died in february of 94. 
[02:44:30]  three months later geez rule number two or his uh principle number two the act is something you  fall back on if you can't think of anything else to say that's great i fall back on it a lot  i hope this movie does well for you guys man it was put together very very very nicely i liked it i think  i think we're just uh immensely appreciative that you know we've had so many people here in the states come  out and say that they really do feel that bill is somebody who should be remembered and that his 
[02:45:00]  work is still relevant that timeless aspect to what he did means that you know he's still um you know  gaining fans now let's get the plugs out there so the the movie american uh the bill hicks story  uh release date april 8th in new york april 15th in la and then hopefully uh you move on from there  right start spreading out it's it's going wide to like another 15 cities and we're also five cities in  canada um and we're also available um to get um online so you can go and check us out at the website  americanthemovie.com how cool is that that's great thanks for doing that as a comic will never ever

[02:46:00]  about the blue collar tour it really kind of ripped it up for a while what do you think about those  tours those kind of that kind of is there something like in english is there something like uh you  know what uh in in london i mean it's it's kind of a different scene isn't it yeah no there's  nothing like that at all in the uk i mean and comedy is still just as strong there as it ever was  you know like lee evans and billy connelly and uh one other guy will do the wembley rich hall is  is a lot of our good guys to you i mean obviously people like eddie izard and you know russell brand 
[02:46:30]  and ricky gervais probably the three most successful stand-ups of the last sort of five ten years and  have all come over here as you can see making movies big time i know eddie did a comedy for a  while i think or did he do a lot of comedy but ricky and uh russell did they really do like stand up  like the way we do it here i mean like did they tour sussex and of course yorkshire and um the  debated isle of white and leicestershire yeah that's the shire yeah um russell brand did um did  yeah eddie used to run his own comedy i was just curious because i never knew like what they what the 
[02:47:00]  road was like over there like what what do you guys do well i think eddie is uh eddie izard um started  out doing um uh the covent garden like kind of street performing stuff and before he went on to do tv  but here we have the olive garden sorry guys we don't understand we don't understand that reference  but um the thing that i think that um uh ricky gervais upset a lot of people about was that um he  came on having not done any stand-up at all and immediately was um selling out uh um and huge and  uh was you know widely thought to be great his stand-up said a lot of comics he's no but he was he's 
[02:47:30]  he's a good comic as far as his stand-up is i like his stand-up his performance is very natural he's  himself but the material you know is very it's something you would like the concept is something  you do very early like you know the nursery rhymes like you know breaking down the what was the  fucking egg-headed one of the uh the guy on the wall you know what i mean it was it was like that i  i think his performance to me was what was very impressive as opposed to the material he's very  charming but ricky came from the radio so rick had done hundreds of hours on the radio yeah that's 
[02:48:00]  where he had i thought it was jim yeah what about jim norton and he uh also known as jim norton yeah  jim norton uh david uh david brent is is the best character ever ever on a television show is david  brent who is he it's gervais in the original office okay you've never seen the original office  i don't really watch the other one either and i don't worry about the new one annoys me although i  must admit when the american one came over we were kind of like ready to hate it and it's actually  pretty good i mean you guys uh you guys over here are able to do something which we don't seem to be 
[02:48:30]  able to do in the uk which is to get a series that runs for like you know eight ten series i i  liked it for the first two or three and then i've tapped out a long time ago does it throw you off  when you see our uh tv i'm starting throat but uh and you see all those commercials that we have  in the middle of it does that throw you guys off when you watch american television no we love  commercials man we buy stuff okay all right we're gonna take a break uh guys thank you so much  back shortly for stopping by american uh the bill hicks story thank you all right uh we're gonna

You had me convinced  I took a bus down  I'm like  This guy obviously  Is doing well in comedy  But he's so rogue  And wants to get material  He's riding on buses to gigs  What?  Anti-social comedy  What happened?  I've never seen the website  I'm one bad gig away  From riding a bus  You know, just like  I'm like the new  Jitney driver  For those things 
[02:58:00]  What happened with that?  Did you guys remember that?  What?  Which one?  The Jitney, like  That horrible massacre  With a car  Was, you know  And like  A lot of people died  Oh, 15 people or something  Yeah, that was horrible  We got to watch that  We got to drive safely  To our gigs  Please  Please, it's important to us  I was leaving a casino  That's how most people  Get to our gigs  From Chinatown  Like the bus  So what's up, Bill?  Nothing  I'm sitting in my laundry room  It's like  With the door closed  So I don't look at my girl 
[02:58:30]  And my psycho pit bull dog  Yeah, laundry room  I was talking to Jimmy  The other day on the air actually  Because Jimmy's trying to finally  Go out and see shit  When he's on the road  And I go  Fucking Bill plans  His whole schedule  Around sporting events  So he gets to check out stuff  In these cities  Yeah, I got to do something  Because it just becomes  Airport and cheesecake factories  Everywhere you go  And it just  I don't know  It makes me go crazy  And I get like  Fucking writer's block  Yeah, well  Jimmy finally checked out  A prison 
[02:59:00]  And the Golden Gate Bridge  In San Francisco  Finally  Finally did something  But the San Quentin  Oh, you would have liked it  Yeah, me and Ken  I've been there  Oh, you went to San Quentin  Yeah, which was nice  Alcatraz  The Alcatraz thing is cool enough  He went to the fucking  An active prison  Yeah, we got to go  Into San Quentin  How'd you get in there?  The CO is a fan  So he sent me an email  Me and Kenny were on the yard  But there was a chicken pox outbreak  So like a lot of the convicts  Were confined  We went into one of the dorms  It was just all prisoners  We didn't go out of the cell block  Just because the chicken pox outbreak 
[02:59:30]  Prevented it  But next time I'm in town  We will  Yeah  At San Quentin  Did you do like a little act  For like the guards  Or something?  No, no, no  I was going to entertain the prisoners  I was going to like stand on the table  Where all the Latin prisoners are  I figured they would enjoy that  Look what I'm doing  What are you going to do about it?  A couple of Johnny Tass songs  Yeah  Yeah, I know  It was a little different  When Johnny was there  Would you go from table to table  And entertain each different gang  And ethnicity?  Yes  Are you that good?  I would just do really racist jokes  But I would just use  Whatever ethnicity I had just left  Like I would make fun of the Mexicans  To the fucking blacks 
[03:00:00]  And the blacks to the whites  The northern Mexicans  Versus the other  They even break it down like that  Yeah  You know that, right?  They'd probably lose me there  Too many locked up abroads  Too many locked up raw  Law shows  Yeah, I got a bunch of  Fucking locked up abroad jokes  We locked up abroad  What did they put a girl in jail?  Fucking ship  Jesus  Anyway  Jesus  Jesus  I'm excited about this next tour  Because I haven't been to Foxwood  In a long time  This next one  You know  Were you just there? 
[03:00:30]  I was there actually  Maybe eight months ago  Okay  A while ago  That's pretty good  That's a good turnaround  I'm happy we sold it  Because it's not in a  It's not in the type of location  That AC is  Where there's a fucking million people  That can get to it  So the fact that people  Want to come out to it  Are you guys going to continue  With the Q&A?  Oh yeah  I love doing that at the end  Just fucking around with each other  Yeah  Tell us the funniest one of those  Sing some songs  Maybe sing some songs  That was very  Yeah  Oh I like the rap pack  I like to call it  It's set up  Other guy leaving you hanging  It's not really much of a Q&A 
[03:01:00]  Yeah  We really are awkward on stage  It's like  So Bill  Didn't you go down to Virginia recently?  No I didn't  Yeah  Alright  It's like an improv group  It's like an improv group  That's like  Each one of them are thinking  Going to law school  But they don't want to tell the other guys  You know  It's like  Jesus  But Bill definitely rocked out  You had a great set  And that's a hard spot  Being the first guy  Well Jim  You set it up very nicely  I think you set the tone  Perfectly  I like having a guy  In front of me though  The first show was the worst one for me  And it was still good  But I wanted  A guy doing three or four minutes 
[03:01:30]  Before me  Helps a lot  Are you going to mix up the lineup  Among yourselves I mean  Yeah I mean  Like instead maybe have  I don't know  Brewer come out first  And you like close it  Those guys can do  Whatever they want to do  I'm hosting it  You're definitely hosting it  I got the easy  The cake gig  Jim you got to come out  Like Joe Torre  With the lineup card  Before every show  I think we should  Let the audience  Pick the lineup  By their Twitter  Blah blah  Or  We can go old school 
[03:02:00]  Like if a guy  Has two clunker jokes in a row  Then the audience is like  That's some corny  Motherfucker  Then the other guy  Walks out  Throwing glitter on them  And you know  That kind of  No  Alright  I'm not really in the idea area  Of the tour  I'm just going to show up on time  I like to  I like to  This is the fun part of hosting  Is like I kind of know  What the guys are going to do  Because I've seen it  A few times  Yeah  Oh yeah  I'll bring new stuff  To this gig  No no no  But I mean  I like to hit on the same topics  That they're going to hit on  And really fuck them up  That is great  No it just kind of gets the crowd  In the mood to hear about 
[03:02:30]  Like whatever Dave's going to talk about  I'll do a few similar things first  Or Bill  Well have you started talking about Japan  At all or no  I have not yet  No  Yeah it's still a  Yeah it's hard  Yeah  It really is  I will  But I mean I just haven't  I mean I  You know I'm just trying to be  Publicly correct  But yes I am so  Oh good  So yeah  If you can save me  That sweet plum  I'm sure you'll have it  Fucking Japan  Jesus  Bill have you been on the road  Have you been touring  Yeah  Yeah  I go out every other week  It's not like I'm making  Yeah you 
[03:03:00]  A bunch of acting work out here  I always like that  When people ask  You know  How long is your  Is your tour going  It's like  No this is what I do  It's every other week  For the rest of my life  Yeah it never ends  You're getting sick  Of looking at ballparks  At this point right  It's like the National Guard  Yeah  Basically  You're in it  Oh yeah  At this point  I'm going to like  A Florida Panthers game  Like I don't even  I've been to all the good ones  I don't even give a shit  Oh shit  You're going to be  Checking out high school sports  Eventually  Well this could be great  As your side career 
[03:03:30]  As a handicapper  To help find the new  Something  March Madness  Something  Hello  I actually did alright  This year  In betting football  I bet every game  And I came out  Right around 500  Which evidently is good  500k  I don't know  Just my average  Oh  I didn't know  50-50  I didn't know  You bet there Bill  I had no idea  Jimmy alright  I don't do it  In a stupid way  I just  Had like one friend  We gambled with each other  And it's like  You know  It's under a grand 
[03:04:00]  It's nothing  You know  It doesn't get crazy  Yeah I don't sit there  Like fucking  Sonny Liston  With my boxing gloves  Still on  Oh was he that  Was he that bad  Was he that bad  Was he a bad gambler  Yeah he would  Win a purse  And you know  Towel off  And go down  To the crap table  Holy shit  Wow  Did he die broke  Towel off  He's sitting there  In the robe  That's great  Yeah there's actually  A picture of him  It was obviously posed  But he was still  I mean I refuse to believe  That he just  You know 
[03:04:30]  Didn't even put a shirt on  But he just  Hits him sitting at a  I think a blackjack table  He looks really sad  Can you see  Can you find that there  Sam  He was killed  I think  By  Wasn't he killed  By the mob  Supposedly  It's kind of like  The Marilyn Monroe  Kind of mysterious  Ending thing  Like you don't know  If it was his lifestyle  Or if  Yeah  Oh okay  How old was he  He was young  I don't know  You know  I wasn't really prepared  For all these  You know what  I apologize  It was a throwaway line  Jimmy  Jesus  I caught myself 
[03:05:00]  Bill does a funny line  About Sonny Liston  And I'm acting like  You're his fucking biographer  Also we're talking  About the documentary  That Bill made  Yeah not really  It's a show of death  In here  Right  Fame  Ain't it a bitch  I'll be right back  With a Sonny Liston story  Hey what do you think  Of your stupid Bruins  They got a shot this year  No we don't have  A Crosby Ovechkin  Level guy  To get us over the top  I mean David Tell  Could tell you that  But I think  We're just gonna get  I don't know anything  About sports  I thought I was gonna  Talk about the black swan  When I came in here  You don't do  Sports Dave at all 
[03:05:30]  I'm gonna make it  To like Eastern Conference  Finals maybe  Okay  Maybe  Did you hear though  On the black swan  That Natalie Portman  Didn't do all the dancing  What what what  That ruined it for me  Yeah me too  I was like  She's just an angel  Yeah so disappointed  Wait a minute  She just did the acting  Yeah  Yeah  She won the Oscar  Without dancing  And danced a little bit  She just did the easy part  Right  80%  No she did 80%  Of the dancing  And she did 100%  Of the fake bulimia shots  Of throwing up  It's like  Can you imagine  Like saying to a skinny actress 
[03:06:00]  Okay what you're gonna do  Is like  You're gonna eat  And then you're gonna throw  I got this  I know  I know what it is  Alright  Let me make it my own  I just did it  An hour before  I thought that movie was good  You guys didn't like it  It was really good  Jim I could see you  Taking a special lady  Out to see  An evening at the opera  Perhaps  Some ballet  Yes  I would always  I'd blow the ending though  This is where the swan dies  I fucking didn't see  Black swan  It was good  I know  I should check it out  Well you know  Of course at the casino  That has a whole  That's somebody's name  Foxwood 
[03:06:30]  But uh  You know the best part  About Foxwood  It's not just a great show  With great entertainers  Like us  And I'm sure the week after  It's like a  Like a Tony Bennett  Or something like that  For somebody really big  But they have that  Really cool like  Mall  It's in  Have you been there man  Yeah  It's like  It's a great place  I would love to go  Yeah like you can hang out  And like you can  Like shop around  I got a waterfall  It's very  You don't feel like  You're in a casino  You don't  You feel like a futuristic world  I think it's the biggest  Honestly the biggest hotel 
[03:07:00]  In the world  As far as footage is concerned  Or square footage  I think it's the biggest hotel  In the world  No way  Yeah yeah I believe it is  When's the Foxwoods date again  April 30th  Oh that's soon  I'm fucking going to that one  Saturday night  Right after Passover  Yeah  Yeah  For the Jewish fans  Of the show  I think we're all there  I think the whole show's gone  I think Ant will be  In  Gamblin  Come on  We should invite those  English guys to come  What do you think  Fuck them  I had a feeling  They didn't really know  Much about comedy  They knew a lot about 
[03:07:30]  Bill Hickstock  They didn't like us  I know that  You know what  I was on hold  And that was really  Annoying me  The way they always  Make America look like  We're morons  Like what moment  In comedy did America  Pick Gallagher  And Carrot Talk  We didn't pick  Richard Pryor  George Carlin  Bill Cosby  Sam Kinnis  It's so funny  How there's like  So many holes  In American comedy  It's like  Mark Twain  Okay Gallagher  You know  It was a couple 
[03:08:00]  Hundred years  There had to be  Somebody funny  Somewhere in between  There was another  Somebody said  Wasn't Kinnison  Biting off of  Bill Hicks  And out here  At the store  I was talking  To those guys  Who've been around  For a while  And it was kind  Of the other way  Around a little bit  Where you know  Kinnison hit in 86  And had the trench  Coat was making  The references  To the devil  And Kinnison  Is one of the most  I think  Underrated comedians  Of all time  I absolutely agree  You're right  Just because  Like I don't think  I ever saw a guy  Get consumed 
[03:08:30]  By fame  The way he did  The way  How fast  He dropped off  Like he had  Like that first special  He had  That he taped  At the Roxy  And then  He was  Un-fucking-believable  Amazing  And then  Like five years  Later  He's coming out  With chicks  On dog leashes  And he's  Playing guitar  And it just  I guess it's  Kind of on him  Because he did that  I was going to say  Didn't he blow it  Himself  By trying to do  The rock thing  Well I mean  What happens  To you guys  Where you decide  You've got to  Do something else  Instead of 
[03:09:00]  Just continue  With the comedy  Because there's  The epitome  Of fame  To everybody  Is a rock star  I don't care  If you're an actor  A fucking athlete  A comic  To be a rock star  Is something  And comedians  Start to get  To that thing  Where we want to be  You think  That's the ideal thing  Is to be a rock star  But we're not  So when comics  Start to think  They're sexy  Or they start to think  That they're rock and roll  That to me  The only guy  That can pull off  The combination  At all is Brewer  But Brewer  Has been  Kind of integrating  Those things  For fucking 20 years  I mean that's  That legitimately 
[03:09:30]  Is what he loves  And Brewer also  Comes at it  From a fan of music  Yes  He's not coming at it  Like  That's true  Oh yeah  Now that I've done  The comedy thing  Now I'm gonna be  A rock star  You guys are missing  The obvious too  The jokes are there  When he's  Imitating rock stars  And stuff  He's got the jokes also  Like when Kinnison  Did Wild Thing  There was nothing  Funny about it  He really wanted  A real good version  Of Wild Thing  Out there  And Bill's right  By the way  About them thinking  In England  That our comic  It's like  They have  They're very PC  In England  Camp Livingston 
[03:10:00]  The fucking  Ex-mayor  Of fucking  London  Was a big  Kind of  Liberal guy  About Islam  And you can't  Fuck with Islam  In England  They don't like it  It's like  Well they'll blow  Up the club  Yeah  They're very  Very  But they're very  Fucking PC  In England  Yeah  They're not  These dangerous  Edgy thinkers  It's just  What they consider  Completely inappropriate  Maybe a little  Bit different  And they're not  As bad  With sex  Yeah  I'm just really  Sick of those  Guys coming  To our country 
[03:10:30]  Telling us  How dumb  We are  It's enraging  It's fucking  One of the most  You know  I went over there  A year ago  And they  Have their  American Idol  Over there  And there  Was these  Two twins  One was named  Jerry  And one was  Named Edward  They were like  I don't know  Like 15 years old  And they went  On stage  With the stage  Named Jedward  And they were huge  They were like  Doing vanilla ice songs  They have their  Pop culture  Horseshit  I'm just  I'm getting tired  Of that  Fucking snooty 
[03:11:00]  Horseshit  From those people  Well you're off  The tour  Okay  Yeah  We don't go  For that type of talk  We'll never play  Sussex  In America  They were choosing  Captain Kangaroo  And Mr. Green Jeans  They're fucking  I would love to have  Seen you over there  Bill  Having to  Because I know  The one joke  That always killed  Over there  When I would  Do shows  Was like  How much  Our politics suck  You know  It's like  Our politics  Bush  He's or whatever  You know  It's like 
[03:11:30]  I'm not a big  Supporter of anybody  But it's just like  Making fun of  American politics  America  You know  Like how stupid  We are  Like you know  With like  You know  Our wars  And all that  Kind of stuff  From a country  That's had like  I don't know  100 wars  To our one  Or two  Our 12 wars  Or something like that  They could definitely  Out  You know  They trash our  Foreign policy  But we have  The same foreign  Policy  It's so  It's so  Weird  You know  But I don't know  Anything about  Their celebrities  Any of their  Unless they come here 
[03:12:00]  Right  You know  I don't know  Until I see them  With Jeremy Irons  Doing something  I don't know  I don't know  I don't know  Any of them  I don't know  Enough about  I've never seen  Anything like  I would never  Go to England  And just go on  A radio show  And just start  Openly trashing  England  I would  But when you do it  From a comedy sense  I wouldn't come  From this pompous  I don't know  What  He was doing that  But they always  Need to come over here  And talk about  How fucking stupid  We are  I went over there  They're just as dumb  As we are 
[03:12:30]  I don't know  What the fuck  They're talking about  We weren't talking  We weren't taking  Them seriously  Because they sounded  So silly  So you know  I don't know  Any English  I don't know  That many British comics  But I don't know  One British comic  Who is as socially  Poignant as Pryor  I mean  Or Carlin  Or Lenny  Any of those guys  Socially relevant  I mean I'm sure  They have them  I don't know Jimmy  I was too busy  Watching Carrot Top  And Gallagher  Oh yeah  I don't go for Pryor either  I think he stinks  I prefer just to bounce  A ball and make  Fart noises  You know Gallagher  Won't do our show anymore  Why won't he 
[03:13:00]  Did Roland tell that story  On the air yet  He did  Why  Yeah he said it  He got an actual  Email back from Gallagher  Is rolling around  Quickly  I'm not sure  Yeah  You gotta hear why  Gallagher will not  Do our show anymore  He's a fucking weirdo  Anyway  I thought he just had  Like a health problem  I thought he  He had a  Minor heart attack  On stage  I saw him on the local news  Out here  His house was getting  Foreclosed  And he was selling  Shit from his act  I swear to god  Yeah  It was deeply 
[03:13:30]  He only wanted fans  To get it  It was actually kind of sad  It was deeply depressing  Because he's  Upper 60s now  And we saw him  Day trading  So maybe he's  A shitty day trader  I sat with him  For an hour  While he did it  We had fun with him  Was he on again  After I wasn't here  That's the most depressing  Well yeah  The problem was  He was on  After K-Rock  When we accused him  Of being a racist  Yeah  How could he be a racist  Wasn't that the Patrice  That was the Patrice thing  Patrice  Patrice fucking  Cut him down  Why  Why 
[03:14:00]  I don't know  It's the watermelons  He died  That's what Patrice does  What is this war  On white comedy  He didn't like  The watermelons  Being wasted  Opie actually  You started it  How did I start it  You asked him  If he liked black people  And he didn't like  That question  And then Patrice  Went  And then Patrice  Started calling him  Leo  Which is his real  First  And he really  Hated Patrice  He does want people  To know that  I guess  We learned  That doesn't ruin it  For me though  I did not like Patrice  That doesn't ruin his act 
[03:14:30]  I think we replayed  That recently right  Leo  Yesterday  But Roland  I don't know where he's at  But he said that  He was emailing Gallagher  And Gallagher emailed him  And said  I was already  Near death once  I can't risk dying  On your show again  Oh  He thought he had  A bad appearance  Sounds like we have  A replacement for  Two and a half men  I like his style  He's crazy  He thought he had  A great appearance  He didn't see it that way  He didn't like it  He got the smash stuff too  So come on  Do it in the studio  Hell fucking yeah  That really does suck 
[03:15:00]  God it sucks  Being a comic  Really like  When you're old  Unless you're like  Really like  You know  Like respecting  And everything  Otherwise it really  Just like  You have to  Get on a cruise ship  And what are you  Going to do Jim  I don't know  You know  Now that you say that  You never see old comics  Yeah you do  I don't see old comics  Colin  Out in Vegas  Colin  What are you going to do  What's your plan  What's your plan B Bill  I'm going to go  With the landlocked  Cruise ship  That is Las Vegas  I'm going to do  One of those  Off the strip 
[03:15:30]  Sort of  I'll do a comedy review  How about an online comedy school  We can all run it  We can be professors  Yes  That's cool  Yeah  We can make guest appearances  We can make a group shop  Where we're wearing  Black framed glasses  And lab coats  That would be great  And we can put like  A graduation hat  On a dog and glasses  Like Professor Ruff  Oh man  That would be good  Roland in studio  So what did Gallagher say  This is an actual email  Yeah I just basically say  He has email  First I called him 
[03:16:00]  He was at Walmart  I said  It's Roland from O&A  And he goes  Oh god don't kill me  And then he hung up  Right  I emailed him  He said  I don't want to die  On your show again  I just had a heart attack  Is he okay  Is he alright  Tell him he had a good appearance  He had a great appearance  Exactly  I did  Then we promised  Not to have any  And then just spell it out  Send him a basket  Of hams and cheeses  A fruit basket  That he could smash  Yeah  Send him a beautiful  Saving of different cheeses  Oh fuck  See  Comics don't live 
[03:16:30]  That's what it is  Right Bill  You're a young guy  You take care of yourself  You work out  Right  I try to  Yeah you know  I eat the granola  Yeah I know  But don't you also  Like hit the gym  You're a gym guy  He's a gym rat  I've actually become  An L.A. fag out here  I go hiking with my dog  Watch out for the coyotes  Next stop  Hot yoga  Mmm  Now look at hot  Yeah right down the street  Jimmy's done hot yoga today  You are?

All you're thinking about is  I'm going to have fucking drop dead  There's no way I'm going to make  It's that bad  Oh it's brutal  Wow  Fucking bells  Did you squeeze  Are you like  Not to use the reference again 
[03:18:00]  But Brando  In Apocalypse Now  Do you  When you get tired  Do you squeeze that washcloth  Over your shaved head?  Yeah and I gently  I skip pat my hands  Across my fucking head  The little skippy patter  Of his hands  Across his fucking head  That's great  That was the longest reference ever  I was running  To get to the washcloth  It's okay  It was well worth it  It's a fucking gem  Hey guys  What do you think of Charlie Sheen?  What's been happening with him?  How did the latest show go?  I think Columbus did well 
[03:18:30]  Good  What's the latest on Columbus?  That's where Jimmy's going to be  This weekend  The funny bomb  Tomorrow's Saturday  Five shows  How was the Columbus show  For Charlie?  They said it was good  Why is it good?  No I mean the crowd reacted well  I should say  Huh  They got a  He finally agreed to have  Someone come out there  And do like an  Inside the actor's studio thing  They just ask him questions  Good  That's what he needs  He just needs the questions  To be asked  And then he kind of goes off  As opposed to the  The video interactive thing 
[03:19:00]  He was doing I guess  Well you know  The crowd still  They probably think  It's being improv then  So it's like  Then they're like  Yeah he might say anything  You know  If you guys can stop being  So bitter for a second  Maybe you should support  A new comic  He just started  I think he's terrific  Just started  I'm very happy for him  Godspeed  There was no bitterness  In that  I mean I couldn't go out  And workshop an hour  Yeah  Just starting in comedy  At Radio City Music Hall  Yeah really  That shouldn't piss off  A few of you guys  It's like my favorite joke  How do I get to  Carnegie Hall practice  But that is 
[03:19:30]  One of the great  The funniest thing  About his tour so far  Was all the  Crowd reaction shots  When they were walking out  In Detroit  In Detroit  Yeah like  What did they think  They were going to see  This one guy's like  I paid 300 bucks  For these tickets  And in Detroit  That's a lot of money  Yeah it's three houses  Yeah you can buy a house  You're right  They walked out  To the hopeless  They're knocking down  Entire blocks in that city  And just planting crops  I think they're like  Going in the opposite direction  It is 
[03:20:00]  It's a book of Eli  Out there  They changed the city limits too  Yeah  Only two  I was going to do  A racial joke  But I don't know  I ran out of steam anyway  Because I forgot why they did it  I tried to sound smart  And then I completely blew it  They changed the city limits  Only two  People with  Wearing purple suits  On the city council  At one time  Who believe God  Is talking to them directly  Well  Jim are you alright  I'm fine Dave  He's pulling a Gallagher

This is what a dummy I am  I said Washington Street  Instead of Pennsylvania Avenue  What does this shutdown  What does this shutdown even fucking mean?  But does that mean  I know I still got to pay my taxes  Exactly  They still will get your taxes right?  If the government shuts down  We don't have to pay taxes  But let's say like you were really rich  Okay  You guys all have  Everybody in this room  Might have a few  I know you're on an island

Yeah isn't that wonderful  Andy Cohen's good though  I don't like him  Roland's being very politically smart  Oh I see  He's smarter than we are  I see  He's doing  He doesn't blow things up on the air like we do  How about some of the cast of the new hit show The Borgias on Showtime?  They were here a month ago  Oh okay  See he knew though
