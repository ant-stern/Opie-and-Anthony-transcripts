<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts engaging in graphic sexual banter, immediately establishing a vulgar tone.  This was followed by a discussion of Pope Benedict XVI's unexpected resignation.  The hosts speculated on the reasons, ranging from health concerns to potential cover-ups of sex abuse scandals within the Catholic Church, referencing a documentary (possibly "Mea Culpa") and Bill Donahue's defense of the Pope on Fox News.  One host shared a personal anecdote about his experiences as an altar boy.  The conversation then shifted to the recent blizzard, "Nemo," criticizing the media's overblown coverage and highlighting the viral "bread and milk" video. They questioned the Weather Channel's naming choice and speculated on potential corporate influence.  The Pope's resignation and the search for his successor remained a recurring topic throughout this initial segment.

The show continued with further discussion of the blizzard, including a humorous anecdote about one host having his driveway mysteriously plowed and tipping the anonymous worker $100. The conversation then transitioned to the Grammy Awards.  The hosts offered scathing critiques of various performers, including Adele's dress, Rihanna's forehead, and Justin Bieber's SNL performance. They also commented on Kelly Clarkson's weight gain, Drew Barrymore's chin, and a CBS memo regarding performers' attire.  Vulgar and sexually suggestive commentary on several celebrities, including speculation about Chris Brown and Rihanna, was prevalent.  The segment included several live reads for Sherry's Berries and Pajamagram.  Criticism of LL Cool J's hosting and Jamie Foxx's comments at the NAACP Awards followed, culminating in a debate about the relative popularity of Jay-Z.  The segment concluded with discussions of various musical artists, including Jack White.

The Grammy Awards discussion continued, focusing on the appearances of Adele, Rihanna, and Carrie Underwood, with the hosts again employing vulgar language. They played a song-guessing game, correctly identifying a Lumineers song after much humorous debate.  The hosts then provided extensive, often vulgar commentary on Ellen DeGeneres, Portia de Rossi, Katy Perry, and John Mayer.  Jay-Z and Justin Timberlake's performances were heavily discussed.  Anthony Bourdain then joined the show in studio. He detailed his experiences filming in post-revolution Libya, describing the security challenges and interactions with Libyans, including armed militia. He discussed his new show, "Parts Unknown," and his perspective on the post-Gaddafi political climate.  Bourdain also shared experiences judging a cooking competition show and recounted anecdotes about various chefs.  Vulgar language and sexually suggestive comments were frequent throughout this segment.


The conversation with Anthony Bourdain continued, beginning with a humorous story about a sushi chef in L.A.  The discussion shifted to high-end sushi, particularly Jiro's restaurant in Japan,  with Bourdain describing the meticulous preparation and high-quality ingredients.  They compared this to more casual sushi restaurants, discussing questionable practices such as using gas to enhance the color of tuna.  Bourdain then discussed filming "Parts Unknown," including upcoming shoots in Quebec and the Congo, detailing the health risks involved, such as contracting guinea worm, liver fluke, and dengue fever. He recounted a severe food poisoning incident in Liberia. He also shared anecdotes about unusual flights and a memorable incident involving a passenger defecating on an airplane.  He mentioned his wife, an MMA fighter. The segment concluded with commercials and a technical issue with Sam Roberts's post-show introduction.


The final segment focused on food, specifically the risks of raw sushi and the eating habits of Roland, a recurring character known for his excessive food consumption.  Troy, another frequent guest, was implicated as an enabler.  They recounted various meals, including Cuban sandwiches, tacos, banana fosters, and chicken and waffles, emphasizing the large quantities consumed.  Roland's infrequent but voluminous Instagram posts were a running joke.  The conversation then turned to Valentine's Day plans, including a discussion about "happy ending massages," with differing opinions among the hosts and guests.  The segment concluded with a promotion of the Dollar Shave Club and its viral video.

[00:02:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show  Yeah, yeah, yeah, 50, yeah  Now I'm typing up in this bit  It's the Opie and Anthony show  Booga, booga, booga, booga  Enough of this platter  Let's get this show on the road  Exactly  Well, good morning everyone  We were gonna talk about the snowstorm  We were gonna talk about the Grammys  But we got breaking news 
[00:02:30]  The Pope is resigning  The Pope  This is breaking as we start the show  Breaking news, Pope to resign  Yeah, what's going on?  I don't know, that sounds a little weird  What's the official statement?  He can't  I heard he's sleepy  We'll step down  We'll step down  Excuse me  We'll step down February  Trying to read that  28th  February 28th  Couple weeks the Pope is saying  See you later  He's protesting Black History Month 
[00:03:00]  Is he?  He objects  Is that it?  Yes  What are they saying?  He's too weak or something?  Yeah, he said  To continue?  Oh, he's very tired  Right  But it's like that's your job  It's the Pope  I don't think you're  I don't think you're really allowed to resign  Well, the Popes have historically dropped dead as the Pope  Right  That's what they do  I think that's part of the job  You're appointed basically by Gwad himself  Yes  You know, Gwad is the one that says  Gwad  You resign  And that means he kills you  Exactly  Your life is over 
[00:03:30]  We're trying to look around in the history of the Popes  And in recent memory this has never happened  And when I mean recent memory  I'm talking about like before the, you know  Yeah  Before  Like the year 300  Thank you, yeah  We went back to the year 300 and this hasn't happened  Something  He's either really sick and it's going to debilitate him  Or he's got some weird scandal  Something's up  Something's up  They're pushing this forward  But I would love to know the real story  Think of Pope John Paul there  When he first came in like many, many years ago 
[00:04:00]  He was the energetic  Young Pope  Pope  They showed video, I think, of him like  Backpacking across Europe  Remember they used to show his little fucking groovy car  He used to love  Yes  And then  Fast forward a few years  If you remember when he did  Right before he died  He was still the Pope  And he was a fucking disaster  He was a shaking mess  He was shaky  He couldn't fucking move his head  He tried to wave  And it was blah blah  So there's nothing to do with being debilitated as the Pope 
[00:04:30]  No, I don't think so either  You know  And this guy  I think they're trying to get ahead of something  I think they are fucking  Putting something in fucking  Yeah  Setting up their  Lining up their ducks  Lining up their Popes  Best Pope  Didn't the Catholic Church just kill the Popes when they had to?  That's what I thought, right?  They would poison them and stuff, right?  They'd give them that old school poison in their wine or something  Last Pope to resign  Seriously, Sam?  Yeah  The year 1417  Ah 
[00:05:00]  Who won the Grimmies in 1417?  Ooh  Why did he step down?  Huh?  The only reason he resigned was because there were two other people also claiming to be the Pope  Oh, really?  So that's when things were a little more complicated  Yeah  Yeah  Wow  So  That's before Columbus sailed the Ocean Blue, by the way  Wow  Jesus  That's a long fucking time ago  So that's almost 600 years ago  That's like history that never really happened  It's so long ago  You can't even imagine it ever really happened 
[00:05:30]  That's some vague history  But now this Pope  And don't forget the Bible was already around  Pope Benedict the XVI  What?  Pope Benedict the XVI  Who do you got in that game?  He's  Yeah  Big sporty logo he's got there  He's stepping down, yeah  I hope it has something to do with the pedophilia scandal  I really do  There's got to be something  There's got to be pedophilia in the Catholic Church  No, no  I'm not saying he is  But he was in charge  His office 
[00:06:00]  He was the cardinal that got all that shit sent to him  Like every allegation  Played for the cardinals  Yeah, he was the shortstop  So he was aware of a lot of stuff that was happening  And then he was like  Oh, he acted like he wasn't  That HBO documentary  Called Mia Culp  Maximum Mia Culp or something  Right  Fucking awesome  Huh  He also, there was those allegations of  That's right  Being a Nazi  Right  I think he's a shitty, shitty guy  You gotta take the bat with the good  Good with the bad  But what's the official statement? 
[00:06:30]  We still don't know  They're just saying he's too weak to continue?  Yeah  But it just comes out of nowhere  Because we didn't even know he was sick  And how old of a man is he?  I don't know  He is a creepy ass looking pope though  It might be something that will affect his job  Like Alzheimer's  Or something like  He just literally won't be able to do  It might just be something like that  But they leave them in there  Too suspicious  They really do  They surround them with people  That put out the statements  Right  Because it's more important  To have the dumb pope there 
[00:07:00]  And you know  He's the Dave Thomas  Dave Thomas didn't make the burgers  Yeah, exactly  He's the figurehead  So they keep him in  And then you got people  Like you said  Around him  That will take care of everything else  This is extremely rare  So we're trying to figure out  What the fuck this means  Here's his statement  I have come to the certainty  That my strengths  Due to an advanced age  Are no longer suited  To an adequate exercise  Of the patrine ministry 
[00:07:30]  Patrine ministry  More like latrine ministry  Ah, you fucking told him  So he's saying  Because he's getting old  And frail  That's every pope  They're elected old on purpose  They don't want a young pope  Lack of strength  They want old pope  Yeah, man  You're not even  You're not even  You know  Considered  Unless you're in your  Like 70s  It seems  Because they don't want you  There too long  They don't want a pope  To be  They want you 
[00:08:00]  The title to be  The fucking  Yes  The face  Not the guy  Not the man  Yes  People saying  He's resigning  Because he's evil  He does look evil  He was weak, man  When he was the cardinal  He was fucking  He could have done a lot more  To help those kids  In those pedophilia scandals  And he didn't do anything  He did investigate it  And I think John Paul  Stalled a lot of it  What about George and Ringo?  I think they were for it  But they were just  So happy to be in the band  Okay  Where's Pete Best? 
[00:08:30]  Poor Pete  So  That's all we know so far  Ah  Bet you something else  Comes out in a couple weeks  Yeah, I bet  But then again, man  They're really good  At covering up shit  They're really good  At that  I mean, but no one  Even knew the guy  Was weak  Or sick  Oh, whatever  How old is he?  How old is  Pope Benedict  The ex-vi?  He's like 80  What does an ex-pope do?  Like we've never seen  An ex-pope before  There's no ex-popes 
[00:09:00]  No, there's no ex-popes  They're always the pope  You've always been the pope  85  He's 85  85  That's getting up there  Yeah, but you're supposed to stay in there  You're supposed to stay in the gig  Till you die  You don't fucking leave  Look at him  He was creepy looking, man  He's still creepy  He's still alive  I am the Paul  He looked more like a vampire  Than any of the other ones  That came before him  Yeah, he's a ghoul  He never had that warm look in his eyes  No 
[00:09:30]  Like the other guy there  The John Paul  Yeah  People love the John Paul  They loved him  Loved him  Driving around in his  Popmobile  Right  Yeah, that was huge  He's another one who kept the lid on things  Fuck him, too  He was another one  Yeah  How do you know?  Because they all  Fucking  They all  They have no, right  The church  And they said  Even when this guy made a statement  It's about how  I can't believe a priest did that  Like they just  The whole fucking thing  Is bent on keeping the organization  Intact  Yeah 
[00:10:00]  I've really grown to hate them  And I grew up in a Catholic  And a churchgoer  And  You going Jew?  No, no  You're going to hell, man  You're going to hell for that  But the whole organization  Is just fucking terrible  And I know they do a lot of charity work  And they've helped millions  And I'm not saying they haven't  A lot of great people in the church  But the hierarchy of the church  And the structure of it  Is fucking disgusting  You know, it's all meant to protect the church  It's amazing how they would  Continually put kid fuckers  Back into rotation 
[00:10:30]  Back  And he was one of the guys that did it  Back into rotation  They really would  He's the guy  I'm all healed up now  I'm like, all right  You're in the starting lineup again  They went through their rehab  That's all we got on that  We're sitting here waiting  Like there's going to be something else  But there's going to be nothing else  That's why this is coming out  I think they're trying to get ahead of something  Ahead of something  Because the guy just got on Twitter too  So they were all in for this pope  I'm predicting some alligators  What did he tweet?  Do we even know what his Twitter is? 
[00:11:00]  The pope tweeted  The pope don't tweet  Oh yeah, Pontifax  Yeah, it was a big deal when he  Wow, he only has 1.5 million followers  You're the pope and you can't get fucking followers  Who's he following?  Only eight people?  What the hell does he follow?  Himself in different languages  I follow Colin Quinn  And I follow Louis C.K.  You think he's a believer?  Maybe he follows the beeps  I follow the beeps  He follows Joe Rogan  Oh, that's Sam's Twitter 
[00:11:30]  That's Sam's Twitter  I got confused for a second  Who does the pope fucking follow?  Come on  Yeah, who does he follow?  Oh, he just follows himself in other languages  What?  Oh, you did?  Yeah  I didn't hear that  It's himself only in different languages  That's correct  That's kind of pompous  Yeah  He actually, wait  One of his languages is Arabic?  Yeah, you see that at the bottom?  Alright, that's crazy  He doesn't know what they're saying  How do you get verified in every language?  I don't know  He's verified  He's verified like nine times  Why don't you  How do I get verified? 
[00:12:00]  He's only tweeted 34 times  He sucks  What kind of tweets?  34 tweets  Did you see Taylor Swift last night?  She was beautiful  Boo  Give me some of his tweets  We must trust in the mighty power of God's mercy  We are all sinners  But his grace transforms us  And makes us new  What day was that?  What was the gymspirations?  Yesterday  That was yesterday's tweet  What's the one  And today he fucking  And then today he fucking resigns?  Right  Stop 
[00:12:30]  How about a fucking Grammy tweet?  You're right  Yeah  And he doesn't use hashtags  What the fuck's wrong with this guy?  LL Cool J's suit looked like he was an ice cream man  LL Cool J stinks  Yeah  He's horrible  I think he stinks  One reason he was hosting the Grammys is because he's got that show on CBS  A little tie-in, right?  Yeah  That was the second year in a row, by the way  I know  Why?  They couldn't find anyone else?  I don't know  What the fuck is that about?  He's a safe black guy who's got a CBS show 
[00:13:00]  Or maybe they felt bad that Whitney Houston dropped dead right before his big hosting duties  That's probably good news for him  So they felt like, you know what, we gotta give you another one  Because the other one was a real downer for everybody  Instead of live-tweeting the Super Bowl  The Pope said, last Sunday  Let us imitate the Virgin Mary in welcoming and guarding the world of Jesus  In order to recognize him as Lord in our lives  Oh  Nothing about the ravens 
[00:13:30]  You can read this stuff on a, like, a placemat  Yeah  Thank you, Lord  For the winter  Because it makes the water that comes out of my faucet really cold  Yes  Give me one more before we move on  Everything is a gift from God  It is only by recognizing this crucial dependence on the Creator  That we will find freedom and peace  So when a grown man's dick goes into, like, a little boy's ass 
[00:14:00]  That's a gift from God?  Oh, boy  No, I don't know  Because it says everything  It says everything  So I want to clarify  Is that actually a gift from God?  Honor  It's up to you to, you know, understand that  As a little innocent child  Does anyone know?  If you watch that special  I have no idea  You will hate the church  Really?  Really?  Hate  What is it on?  HBO documentaries  You saw it, Mark?  I'm all about it  How hateable are they?  I hate this fucking guy  The whole organization from him on down 
[00:14:30]  And again, a lot of good people in it  But when he was in charge  He, when he was at the Cardinal  Who was in the fucking Vatican  Baseball, right  No, no, no, no, the football  Baseball would be childish  I grew up Catholic  And when I go to church now  Which I do a few times a year  Ooh  I get really creeped out by every single priest  Yes  And I know  I know there's some very good guys there  Yeah  But this scandal's gotten so out of control 
[00:15:00]  And you know that  Even the good priests  All kept their fucking mouth shut  For the most part  Yep  That it's just so creepy for me  I try to keep my mouth shut  Because I go with a lot of people and family  But they always creep me out  It's amazing how the image of a priest is now a pedophile  It creeps me out  Yeah, it's great  Like you just wonder right away  If that person that, you know  Has been touching kids  Yeah  And I don't know if that's the right way to think  But that's where I'm at with it  Yep  And I would change the fucking uniform or something  Something a little more up to date 
[00:15:30]  I don't know  Without the collar  Yeah, I don't know  Something new and hip  You know, good luck to the Catholic Church  They're in a tough spot  I don't know how they turn it around  I hope they can  And they're not willing to change  That's the problem  No, that's it  It's a very old school thing, man  You know  Right  They have their ideology  And their little boys club there  And that's it  That's what it's going to be forever and ever  Forever and ever  And their veil of secrecy 
[00:16:00]  Yes  Over what they knew  And fuck  They're just despicable  Yeah  Are we done with his tweets?  Give me another tweet  Just in case you thought  We were the only ones with assholes  Yeah  Everything is a gift from God  Yeah  The second reply is  When is Half-Life 3 coming out?  Really?  I love it  He's got his Twitter haters  I love you, Popey  I'm resigning 
[00:16:30]  Why don't you try working a real job, Pope?  This guy says  Well, you can't handle it  You can't handle it  You fucking being the Pope  Try being a roofer  AIDS!  Exactly  That makes me  Makes me  And probably most people listening right now  Feel better about themselves  Exactly  That the Pope also gets haters  Pope has his haters on fucking  On Twitter  In reference to God 
[00:17:00]  Yeah  One guy responded  So he got me that pasta machine  For my birthday  Can you ask him for the receipt?  I don't need two  Oh  He doesn't mean a gift from God like that  That's a gift  From God  Oh no  Another guy asking  You sassin his holiness again?  He gonna be mad  Sassin  Son, all I've ever asked of my marines  Is for them to obey my orders  As they would the word of God  The word of God  God  God  And another Pope tweet?  Yeah  By the way, I'm not questioning anyone's faith 
[00:17:30]  No?  No, because you get those tweets  After we do these breaks  I'm not questioning anyone's faith, man  At all  It doesn't seem to hurt Ricky Gervais  Yeah  He's constantly going after the Catholic Church  Yeah, he loves it  Yeah  Which is good  Yeah  I would love to see them turn this thing around  But I don't know  Not gonna happen  They just won't  They won't  Because whenever these victims groups sue  They pay out so much  Billions of dollars they've paid out  They don't want to give out the information 
[00:18:00]  The Catholic Church has paid out billions of dollars?  They said I think Boston has lost half of their fucking  Not their  What's the word?  So what are they saving all their money?  No  What are they saving all their money for?  If they have billions of dollars where they can go  Ah!  Take this billions of dollars  They just got piles of billions of dollars  So they're like  Take this billions of dollars and just pay off everybody  We still have this pile of billions of dollars  Yeah  And this pile of billions of dollars  Yeah  Like what are they waiting for? 
[00:18:30]  How about you start fucking giving a lot of that money to the people that need it?  No  I wonder if Timothy Dolan will be considered  He was a  He's another fucking  I know he's the big  He's the cardinal here in New York  But he's fucking awful too  He's another one that's a big church apologist  And was  Well you know  I think the church is handled  He thought they handled the scandal well  Wow  This idiot  Yeah  Wow  Well  Ugh  I bet  I bet I know who's gonna be making the rounds on the news  Ah  Yeah  Why don't we get him on the phone today? 
[00:19:00]  Maybe we should  That's who we should be getting on the phone today  Donahue  If you got a pope resigning  We go right to Donahue  Bill  Bill Donahue  Let's see if Bill will come on and explain a thing or two  I'd like to hear his comment  He was in the special for a second  They show him on Fox  Right  And the woman  Just blowing a boy  No there's a woman from the Times  Who blew a lot of the lid off this stuff  With some article on what the fucking Vatican actually knew  And everyone always blamed these cardinals  And blamed the local bishops 
[00:19:30]  And then they have all this proof  That they were writing the Vatican  Trying to get help  Wow  And the Vatican was saying no  Don't say anything  Keep it quiet  And don't turn them over to the cops  So Donahue was defending this pope  Oh he was?  Yes  On Fox  Saying about a case  About the guy who molested all these deaf priests  Who that documentary's about  Jesus  And he's like  He didn't  The case is from the 50s  And he found out  And the guy died while they were investigating  Yeah  But then she's saying that this guy  Had a lot more to do with covering it up  Wow 
[00:20:00]  Well not necessarily covering it up  But not being actively going after  Well let's get a call to Bill Donahue  That would be great  I'm sorry I'm giving a lot of half truths  I mean like half information  Like I'm giving 10% of the information  That's what this show is all about  But I'm telling the truth  But I just like fucking run out of steam quickly  And forget  Well I'm fucking going to watch that documentary today  Yeah that sounds good  It's mea culpa  Oh mea culpa  What is that in English?  My fault  So just say my fault  No it's Latin though  It's not Spanish  Oh  But it's a great documentary  You're right  Same thing  Were you touched as a kid? 
[00:20:30]  I can't stand  No  I can't stand  By a priest?  Yeah  He said it really quick  Did you go to church?  Yes I went to church  I was an altar boy  And a choir boy  Oh you so  You must have  Oh boy  Oh you so blew a guy  No I did not  Oh boy  If you're allowing your mom  To take a hot oily spatula to your hands  I think some action happened to you  Well priests don't do that kind of shit to you  Oh really?  Who does?  My mom  Oh the spatula  Yeah  No I'm talking about the hiney play 
[00:21:00]  Yeah for a second I was like  What are you talking about?  The last play  No  No ass play  You were probably easy  Man  No  You were probably  Because he needed love  He wasn't getting love  Yes  Oh man  You kind of enjoyed it  Like you know what  You know I'm not going to get a hug from my mommy  So what the hell  The comfort of another man's arms  Right  Did you look like one of those little kids  You need like 35 cents a day for your village and shit  You must have looked like a little Hispanic kid  Because that's before you discovered you know  What 
[00:21:30]  Working out and MMA and all that shit  Yeah  Were you a frail little kid?  Is that why you got into MMA?  I was right  Psychologically  Of course  To defend yourself against something that had already happened  Of course  Oh I get it  I get it  What do you think?  Of course it is  Oh Mars  You love it and all  But that's what drew you to that whole thing  Yeah  That's so obvious  And we don't need a psychologist for that  Oh it's so obvious that I got abused  Yeah  Yeah  No no  I'm just saying  I'm talking now about your mom and all that crap 
[00:22:00]  Yeah  Oh yeah  You didn't want to deal with it anymore  So you made sure as you grew up as an adult  That no one was going to fuck with you anymore  That's obvious  And you probably got sexually abused too  And yeah  You probably took a couple digits in your hiney  Abuse  While you were betting on getting the offerings ready  Yeah  Yeah  You guys are terrible  A little hiney play  What's wrong with that?  Hiney play  You couldn't  I mean it wasn't your fault  I was turned off by  The first sign that I was  I was  Thinking  What the fuck's going on? 
[00:22:30]  I was a caddy at the Huntington Crescent Club  And  The head priest  And the  Like  Second in charge  Of  Our Lady  Queen of Martyrs  Yeah  Back in the day  Out there in Centiport  Comes pulling up in this  A sick  Brand new Cadillac  To play golf  He was a guest  He was driving a Cadillac  And  And I ran down to get his bags  Which you had to do  As a caddy  And I pulled out  The fucking nicest golf clubs  And I'm like  Holy fuck  Seriously?  You guys turn in a nice dime, huh? 
[00:23:00]  Yeah  But they  They hid all that shit  From you  Yeah  You know  When you did see him  When you didn't see him out and about  Like I was  I was fortunate enough  To see him that way  Because I worked at the  You know  The golf course  Uh huh  You never saw him like that  All flashy and shit  Yeah  It was a  A brand new  I'll never forget  A brand new black Cadillac  Gorgeous  Gorgeous car  Are they supposed to like  Be impoverished or something?  Well that was my point  Or the vow of poverty?  Well that was my point  With the billions of dollars  That they're collecting  It's all bullshit in the end  And the church has got a lot of money 
[00:23:30]  My favorite part about churches  Most churches in Manhattan  Lock their doors  You have to  For what reason?  You know  The homeless  Yeah but that's what  Jesus was all about  Well they want to  Always steal the chalice  They're always stealing the chalice  But it seems like  They have a lot of fucking money  So you keep the church doors open  It's not up to you  God  They keep them open in the movies  Huh?  They keep them open in the movies  Yeah  You know when the guy's got to come in  And he goes in there  And there's a big gunfight in there 
[00:24:00]  But they lock it  Yeah  The needy  You know  The homeless and all that  Even the church knows  The needy stink  Well  But that's my point  It's so hypocritical  Yeah  Because Jesus took care of all those people  Right?  Yep  Didn't matter if you were an alcoholic  Homeless  Needy person  He didn't give a crap  I don't think St. Pets closes ever  Most of them close though  Yeah  Most of them  There are a few that stay open  I mean there's some that they close them up like it's a prison 
[00:24:30]  They don't want you climbing the walls or nothing  Yeah  Yeah but you're right  That institution sucks man  I mean they do a lot of good shit  But they also do  I don't say it sucked  Well I do  I'm saying it sucked  Jenny said it sucked  And they stink  So do I  Because they hide a lot of shit  A lot of secrecy  It's just fucking ridiculous  It's dirty man  I don't know how they turn it around  And with the Pope resigning  If you're just tuning in  We're talking about this  Because the Pope is resigning  It's breaking news  As we start our radio show today  Something is extremely suspicious here 
[00:25:00]  Because like Anthony said  You're supposed to die in office  That's part of the gig  Like when you get the job  You're like  Even if I get sick  Even if fucking something happens  Right  You just stay there  Until you drop dead  And then you know  Your other little Pope cronies  They put out the statements  They say  Oh yeah the Pope  And they fucking stand him up  At the little balcony  And gives the wave  Yeah they're actually  Not doing anything anymore  But as the figurehead  Of the Catholic Church  I don't  You're not supposed to resign 
[00:25:30]  What year again?  14?  17?  17 something like that  Was the last time  That a Pope resigned  And that was  By dating Ainge rage too  That was the last time  A Pope resigned  And that was because  They had three Popes  So somebody had to step down  Yeah  That was the only reason  They didn't know  Who the hell the Pope was  So a couple guys said  Alright we'll fucking step down  And let this one guy have it  Yeah  Well  Show me a video of the old Pope  As an old man 
[00:26:00]  Just to show you that  Pope John?  Yeah  Pope John Paul  Look at the video  At the end of his life  He was a wreck  Remember that?  He was shaking  From the Parkinson's  His head was sideways  His mouth was tilted sideways  And they would just have him  Fucking barely lift his hand up  And wave  Right  It's like Weekend at Bernie's  Is this near the end?  Yeah  I mean it's a documentary  Called The Last Days  Oh my God  That's an hour and a half long 
[00:26:30]  What is Jesus?  Let's just watch the whole thing  We still gotta talk about  The Grammys  Or do we?  Yeah  We gotta talk about the Grammys  That's him  We getting  That's him dead  Oh that's him dead?  Jesus  Dang  Clang  That's the new guy  Sam  That's the new  Sam  You gotta go  You gotta go  Before he died  What are you doing?  Obviously when they show him dead  They're not gonna show him  Back alive anymore  You're supposed to say  Spoiler alert  Oh  Spoiler alert  He's dead  Oh yeah  He's very very old 
[00:27:00]  Look at him  He's just fucking  And his frustration  Oh my God  Look at  Holy  Wow  Oh my  Dude he sounded like  A monster movie  Why can't you find  That's the old pope?  Yeah  He looks like he has  What's that?  Parkinson's  Is that part  Or cerebral palsy?  Oh right  God 
[00:27:30]  He looks like he has cerebral palsy  Maybe it's one of those  And it looks like his arms  Were kind of tied down  To the wheelchair  So he wouldn't hurt himself  Did they take the mic away from him?  No  That's all he could do  He went  He could get enough energy up  To just do that much  And that was it  That was  That was pretty much  Maybe saying  God bless you or something  Yeah  That was it  Oh my God  His fucking  It was girly  That's why this is so suspicious  This guy is resigning  See look at the mic  The hand pulls the mic away  Yeah yeah  Look at his hands  They look like they're tied  To the wheelchair 
[00:28:00]  Do you have um  Do you have that audio again?  I gotta hear his voice  Listen  Listen to him  Now back a couple  Oh my God  Sam  It's tough to back up a video  That's an hour and a half long  I know  It's almost impossible  Yeah  He either went back  Ten seconds  Or two and a half minutes  Oh  Oh my God  Looks like he's still  Trying to talk  And they pulled the mic away  Yeah because  They were like 
[00:28:30]  Holy fuck  We can't let this out  Yeah because he wasn't  In control anymore  They were just showing him  Is that all they got  Of him talking?  There's gotta be more  Go on YouTube  See if there's anything else  Oh my God  He sounded like a lion  Or something  It was like gurgling  Like full of  Fucking water lungs  Yeah  That's terrible  But that's usually  What happens  They go right to the end  Gee  Yeah  See that guy  Believe me 
[00:29:00]  And there was no hint  That this Pope  Was sick or anything  No  Pope's last public appearance  He's trying  That was last public appearance  That might be the same thing  I think it is  They just got him like  In a window  At the Vatican  He looks like he's  Having such trouble breathing  Yeah he's just shaking  And he's moving around  And then they wheel him  Oh my God  They wheel him into the shadows  And the curtain goes 
[00:29:30]  And that was it  That's creepy  I've been here some years ago  And he was full of power  And energy  And now he's  Old weak man  But still strong in faith  Strong in faith  This message he gives us now  Believe my life as this  Is now  Is a true  Important life  And it has worth  Oh my God  Is that fucking awfulness  Wow  That was definitely creepy  Wow  So  Alright  Does this 
[00:30:00]  There is a translation  As to the statement  Made by the Pope  So we're getting  Build on to you  Hopefully  It might be a little early still  But we'll try to get him  Oh my  News is breaking  So  I wonder if  If Dolan will be considered  Or if he's too young  Or if they wouldn't consider  An American guy  Who knows  Yeah  I'm sure he's  On the short list  You know what the Pope  Sounded like there  He sounded like 
[00:30:30]  If I can remember  Ash  The android guy  From Alien  Wow  After his head  Got fucking  Cut off  And they put it back together  And that white shit  Was coming out of his mouth  I love love  That's terrible  It really is  As we rebuild our economy  What?  What?  What's that about Sam?  What happens?  How's that end?  We're rebuilding our economy?  John Paul II is without a doubt  The Pope who has broken  The most records  In the church's history  Look how vibrant  He used to get out 
[00:31:00]  He was head of the Catholic Church  For 26 years  People love this guy  What are we looking at here?  Then he's also  The video  Oh okay  Didn't they shoot him too?  Yeah  He got shot  By a Turkish guy  Yeah  And he forgave that guy  Yeah  That's your job as the Pope  You gotta forgive  Always forgive  A lot of forgiving going on  No matter how bad things get  John Paul II  Might have broken  Many records  On different fronts  He was the first  To visit a modern day synagogue 
[00:31:30]  It's the first  Crazy  Alright well  Advanced  Yeah due to advanced age  No  They all have advanced age  They were promoting him  Getting on Twitter  Yeah  Only recently  When you have  When you still have your faith  You're supposed to still be the Pope  Sure  Absolutely  That's crazy  Absolutely  They're gonna pull out some fucking  Fucking Nazi shit  Or some pedophilia shit  How about Nazi pedophilia 
[00:32:00]  Because that's gotta be  Some real heinous stuff right there  Maybe that  Maybe that's it  That's the worst kind of pedophilia  Nazi pedophilia  Holy shit  That would be  That's gotta be crazy  That's like movie shit  Right there  Mmhmm  Okay  So um  We got that today  Which is nice  Which is nice  I don't think anything  Earth shattering  Is gonna happen for a week or two  I have a feeling  Something else is up with this whole thing  Yes I think we're just scratching the surface here  But then again  They know how to cover up shit  So  Yeah that's what they do best 
[00:32:30]  Very interesting  Mmhmm  Uh the Grammys  A lot of people saw the Grammys last night  Yes  What do you think of the Grammys?  Uh  Well I thought um  The opening number  With the lovely Taylor Swift  Was very nice  She had her little  With her weird nose  A little hat  And her  She doesn't have a weird nose  She was stunning  She was stunning  She looked lovely  She looked lovely  Jimmy  I told that before the show  It's getting tougher  To continue with my Taylor Swift bit 
[00:33:00]  Right  She's fantastic  He was ridiculously hot  I mean  Jesus  She uh  She came out with that top hat  And those legs for days  She had the long legs  And uh  Yeah the little top hat  She's got skinny bunt  Though  What  Skinny bunt  Skinny bunt  Yeah  Did you see skinny bunt on her?  Oh yeah  She might be too thin  Which is uh  Creating the illusion  That she has  Like a bunt  I don't know  You gotta go to the part  Where she takes off  Her uh  Her long coat  Oh man  She's got skinny bunt 
[00:33:30]  Skinny bunt  And she took a little shot  At Harry I noticed  From One Direction  Oh yeah  Oh the gossip sites  Are going nuts  Over that  Oh what the hell's that about  What was her  Was this lip syncing?  I don't think so  Nah  It didn't sound lip syncing  See look at those skinny bunt  Does she have skinny bunt?  A little bit  See the latest guy she broke up with  Is this Harry guy  From One Direction 
[00:34:00]  So she kind of took a shot at him  Saying uh  What was the line?  Well when she did her line in the song  She did it with a British accent  She did it with a British accent  And said I don't have  What's the line from the song?  She goes because I'm too busy  Opening up the Grammys  Right  But what's the line from the song  That she kind of shoehorned in there?  Oh something about  How you  You can't keep an erection  See she was  That's why she broke up with her  This stupid song is catchy 
[00:34:30]  I'm embarrassed to say it but  Her new one  Pop music is so damn catchy  Her new one's catchier  I mean this song is over  The never  Never  Never  It's this song  No I know  That's catchy  The new one's catchy too  Trouble  That's the song  Which one is that?  How does that go?  Trouble  Trouble  Trouble  Yeah  Kind of  Same song  Over and over 
[00:35:00]  Nah she's  She's gonna have longevity  Yeah  Yeah  Taylor Swift will absolutely  Have longevity  She's having longevity  That's true  For their fifth album  But how old is she?  She's only like 24 right?  23  That's right  I mean I'm talking when she  Hits her 30s and beyond  She'll be around  I heard she's gonna be done  By October  Twitter voice guys  That's all I do now  On the weekends  When I'm reading Twitter  I do the Opie Twitter voice  I got a new Twitter 
[00:35:30]  Pet peeve  Pet peeve  To everyone out there  And I know you mean well  Just because a guy has  Strawberry blonde hair  Doesn't mean he looks like me  Hey Opie  Why are you singing with Elton John?  I'm looking like Ed  No  Hey Opie  You don't look like Ed Sheeran  Yeah  You know when the US Post Office 
[00:36:00]  Made their announcement  That they're not doing  Saturday deliveries  A guy sent me a picture  He goes  I didn't know you worked  For the post office  It's always  I didn't know you  And then whatever the fuck it is  And it's a picture of a guy  Delivering mail  That has  Almost the same color hair as me  But the face is completely different  Yeah  I guess what  Like black people  We all look alike  Or something  I guess so  I didn't know you 
[00:36:30]  Supposedly I played in three or four different bands last night  Of course  So now that I  I know what I just did to myself  By the way  I'm not stupid  That's all I'm going to get now  Yeah  On Twitter  I was getting a little bit of flack  Over the weekend  About our snowstorm  Yeah  And you know  Yeah you really don't know how to predict snowstorms  Well you know  I might have  You're over too  A little prediction  About the snowstorm  And I don't think it 
[00:37:00]  It went my way  But hey you know  I'm not a meteorologist  Wow  No  You're not even a radio guy  No  Just a mean person  That snowstorm was a motherfucker  How many answers did you get out near you?  I would say I got probably  14, 15 inch  Basically  14, 15 inch  South of the city  You pushed about  What?  10 inches to a foot  Yeah  The city was about the same 
[00:37:30]  But then man  North of the Long Island Expressway  On Long Island  That's where the line was basically  That got some crazy fucking shit  Like over 30 inches in some places  Yeah  Yeah  We haven't seen one of those in a long time  In a while  I mean everyone got the blizzard from what?  Jersey all the way up to Maine  That never happens  Connecticut had fucking feet of snow  40 inches  Crazy  Unbelievable  40 inches  Yeah  Connecticut was crazy  Fucking eastern Long Island  North shore was insane 
[00:38:00]  Yeah  My brother got well over 30  Wow  Yeah  My brother's in Port Jeff  And he got like  He had pictures of his back door  Of his house  Just  It was up  Three quarters of the way up the door  Yeah  I retweeted one of his pictures  Yeah  He had an amazing picture  Amazing  Yeah  But I mean the snow  This is old news obviously  But a few things  The snow was coming down so heavy  That people had to  Had to just leave their cars  On the Long Island Expressway  That never happened  Because usually what happens in snowstorms 
[00:38:30]  We all know  The cars kind of keep the snow packed down  Enough where you got at least one lane  And you guys  Everyone could get home  Yeah  The snow was falling so hard  That they couldn't keep up with it  They just reached the point  Where their cars wouldn't go anymore  Well you probably also get stuck behind other people  Who can't  Who don't know what they're doing  Right  There's a chain reaction  But in most snowstorms  You're able to like maneuver  And get around those dummies  And get yourself home  But it was falling so fast  Two to three inches an hour  That  Yeah  It just stranded people  All over the fucking place  So what do they do  When you're stuck 
[00:39:00]  What do you do  When you just leave your car  A few people  The smart people left their cars  And then the unsmart people  Think their car is like  The shit  And it's the most valuable thing  In the world  So they sit there all night  Can't leave it on the road  There it is  That's the picture  Which one?  No there's a million of these  Yeah that's one of them  There's a million pictures of  Like just  I mean in this picture alone  There's 20 cars that just said fuck it  And just you know  Left their cars on a major highway  Are they all  And look they're in all different directions 
[00:39:30]  Because you know they're spinning out  And then they're trying to go backwards  To another  Yep  You know now they're going against  Well it's not traffic anymore  But they're going the wrong way  To try to find an entrance or exit ramp  Just to get the hell off that thing  That's fucking sick  Amazing  Yeah  Anyone freeze to death?  No I mean surprisingly  Not many deaths  It wasn't  10 or 11 deaths  Deaths for the whole thing  Yeah  Up the entire coast  That's pretty impressive  That  That's the LIE now 
[00:40:00]  It's got a traffic light  No  No that's not the LIE  But  I'm not sure what that is  No they were definitely stranded all over the  They were stranded on all roads  But they were showing the LIE  As the most impressive one  But it was happening on every road  They showed a shot  Near the Smithhaven Mall  Which it was unbelievable  How many cars were stranded  Just in that little area  That definitely  Long Island got hit pretty bad out there  Dude  And  Tragic story  And I just get so mad at the fucking news  Because they went with it over and over again  You hear about that kid in Boston? 
[00:40:30]  What happened?  The father and the son  He's like 12 I think  He's trying to shovel out his car  The son gets cold  So  The father goes  Yeah I'll start up the car  And you know  You go in there and get warm  Oh boy  The fucking tailpipe was clogged  So  Carbon monoxide poisoning  That's one of those things  That like you just know  It's horrible  But that's one of those things  That you just know as a person  That if you  Start your car to keep warm  You gotta keep the tailpipe  Right  It's like crazy 
[00:41:00]  And they  They went with this story  Every 15 minutes  Was the father outside  Shoveling while the kid was inside?  Yep  And then noticed he wasn't breathing  They tried  And he went into cardiac arrest  And that was it  How old was he?  I think 12  But the news  And the father wound up having a heart attack  He did?  Yeah  He's okay I guess  But yeah  He like lost his fucking shit I guess  God  Just go on to the fuck  Get some milk or eggs  Or whatever the fuck you're gonna get  Not even  Just trying to get your car out  Some people should just stay the fuck home 
[00:41:30]  During snow storms  I gotta be honest with you  I took a little drive around  I took a little drive around  And people are idiots  They really are incapable of driving in it  They don't have the proper vehicles  To be driving around in the snow  They just don't consider what could happen  My favorite is the news  Which we've done a million times in this show  Yeah  But I love the news reporter that's out there  I guess they're an expert on driving in the snow 
[00:42:00]  Because they got a microphone and a camera in front of them  And then they point out everyone else going  I can't believe anyone's out here  What makes you special?  They got a mic  It's like how did you get around?  Guess what?  How you got around?  A lot of other people can do the same exact thing  That's how I'm doing it  Right  I can't believe it  No one's heeding the warning  How about you heed the warning?  We don't need your stupid report  Because you're not getting anything done anyway  How about you go home?  They told people in Massachusetts 
[00:42:30]  Just to stay off the roads  They said hey you're not allowed to get on the road  They said a year in jail  Yeah  No one would get to a year in jail by the way  I don't understand  Did they really say that?  It was a $500 fine or a year in jail  That seems like the fine should be a lot higher  It's like what do I do?  I think I'll take the $500  I like my pocket money  I'll take the year in jail  Year in jail?  We got the Mayor Menino audio?  Yeah  In Barbaston  We absolutely should have the Menino audio  Because I know it's old now 
[00:43:00]  But  Yeah  He had to go live  To talk about this  The snowstorm  And people were just  Once again amazed by how this guy speaks  He's not very good  At public speaking  I'll tell you though  I think you said it before we started today  It's not like the old days  You get your shit right back together after these snowstorms  It's not  Everyone still remembers  Like the 70s  When cities would be shut down for days 
[00:43:30]  Right  And people were like  Oh I can't get out  And this needs to be plowed  I can't get to the store  There are instances where I guess some roads don't get plowed  And I'm sure we got a few out there now  Exactly  But  For the most part  When we were growing up  You would look out your window  And you would just see that  Like just frozen tundra  And you felt like time stood still  Yes  You could hear like a bird in the distance  Yeah  And nothing was getting done for a few days  Nothing  You just knew that you were done for two or three days 
[00:44:00]  Not anymore  Your street didn't get plowed  Like you sat there until  Like this hits Saturday  Maybe a day, two days later  This hits Saturday, right?  Yeah, for the most part, sure  If this was when we were growing up  People would not be going to work today  Yes, still  But everyone is expected at work today  Oh yeah  Oh, if you're calling in  You know, look  E-Rock's here  Nuff set  There you go  Nuff set  E-Rock, you shovel a lot of snow?  Comment?  Yeah, some  Oh  The rest was  Borrowed a snowblower  And then just cleared the rest of it 
[00:44:30]  It needed some money  Greatest invention ever  Snowblower  Snowblower  Yeah, that's one reason  You would have to  Like try to  You'd have to get a plow  Remember  We would be on a list  We would get the local guy  Oh man  And you'd have to sign up  Way before winter hit  To be on his list  To plow out your driveway  And you had to wait  Yeah  You didn't have a snowblower  To do it yourself  No  You waited for the plow guy  And you got so excited  When he finally made it to your house 
[00:45:00]  You're like  Alright, we can finally leave  I'm talking about the big  Over the top  You know, storms  Where you couldn't shovel your way out  Yeah  But now people go to the store  And they're like  Oh, we gotta get  The bread and milk and eggs  I don't even think  Everybody makes French toast  Apparently during storms  It's a funny joke  Did you see the video  It went  It went  Like way viral  Of the bread and  The bread and milk guy  Is that Vic?  Do you know him?  He's a buddy of mine for years  He's a comedian

[00:47:30]  Okay  But this one is his big fucking hit  4.3 million already  More than yours, Sam?  No  Not yet  Oh  What else about the snowstorm?  Oh, we didn't have the salt growing up  We didn't have the sand  Yeah, yeah  The spreaders that are all over the place  And they come out before the storm  That never used to happen  Those fucking trucks would be out there  Maybe  Plowing the streets  After it started snowing  Right  Now they get out there  Lay down the salt  So there's no  There's no reason to panic 
[00:48:00]  Like people fucking panic  Yeah  I was on a gas line  I had a fucking  We're gonna be at a gas line  And people were just like  Obviously they didn't need the gas  Right  I needed the gas, my friends  You actually just needed gas  Yeah, I needed gas  You weren't going there because you were convinced Armageddon was happening  No, I had like no gas in my vehicle  So yeah, I went to fill up  And fucking gas line  People just panic  I guess on the heels of the hurricane 
[00:48:30]  That's, you know  Still there was no reason for it  Yeah  I was trying to get a massage booked  And the girl wouldn't come  Because she had to get gas  Oh, was that it?  Oh, she said she had to get gas?  Maybe she said she had gas  That was very embarrassing for her  Wow  Yeah, wow  Yeah, it was  It was kind of  I kind of like snow like that  But a lot of the streets are now plowed  They had to shut down the LIE yesterday  Just to get all the cars off it  And to, you know, clear it  So they're plowed  LIE was closed  Most of yesterday 
[00:49:00]  And today, actually  I think from 57  I think they opened it  Out east  They opened the westbound  Oh, eastbound was still closed  You're right  But eastbound from 57 on  Was still closed  I did hear that  But who goes that way to work?  That's exactly it  It's like, who cares?  They're like, look  You know, give us another day  To get the eastbound open  We got people that gotta go west  Who's going out there to work?  No one goes out there to work  Who's going to work?  So, I guess that's it on the storm  Yeah  Most of the shit was covered over the weekend  I can't get enough of 
[00:49:30]  Just watching these dopey reporters, though  I can't get enough of it  They put them everywhere  I have like 10 stations  I'm just like  Click, click, click, click  Yeah  And they're just all a bunch of idiots  Did you see the guy at the beach in Revere?  I saw that guy  You did, right?  Yeah  What's the point?  No one goes to the beach in the winter  Yeah, who cares?  And what was he trying to say?  I don't even know what he was saying  It was actually odd to look at a beach with snow on it  It's like, I can't 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, but  I couldn't imagine that  But even that was boring  Yeah, it was boring as hell  He wasn't getting any good shots  What did he do?  I don't know  He was trying to say  Like the surf is rough  And that high tide  And the snow  And maybe the water is going to be a little higher than usual  But I'm like  Okay, but no one's at the beach  Did you see when the two guys  And the houses down there are already prepared for that shit  They understand that for the most part  Did you see when the two guys showed up  And he started talking with them  And the guys were like  I've been here, you know, 17 years  And he's like  Well, what do you think of the surf? 
[00:50:30]  And he was like  He goes  I was expecting a lot more  I've seen it a lot more  And the weather guy was like  Oh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye  Goodbye, see you, see you  Oh, we need to panic, panic, panic  Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye  I just feel like there's another way to do that  I understand they're trying to keep viewers and stuff  They certainly are  But I think more and more people are onto their bullshit  There was another guy  I wish I wrote down the town  In Connecticut  You know, higher elevation towns  So the news goes to these higher elevation towns  Knowing the snowfall is going to be even more impressive there  And they're on Main Street 
[00:51:00]  It's that Lou guy  Lou guy  From local  Grant?  Lou, somebody help me out  Oh, the driver from The Godfather?  I heard he did nice work  But he's in Main Street  Lou Dobbs  Lou Dobbs it might have been  Lou Dobbs  Lou Dobbs  Lou Dobbs  Local?  No, he's like  Lou Gehrig  Local guy 
[00:51:30]  It might even be CBS  CBS  Locally  Anyway, he's in this small town  In Connecticut  On Main Street  Everything's shut down  And a guy walks by  And he's like  So, what do you think?  He goes  You know what?  You know  Another big snowstorm for us  But, you know  We live in a higher elevated area  So we get this  And he was so pissed  That this guy  This guy wasn't going to play along  With his bullshit  Right  They need panic  They need craziness  They need it to be the worst ever  So they could go like  Right  You know  Here we're talking with this guy 
[00:52:00]  Oh my god  I've been here forever  But I've never seen it this bad  You know  These towns in Connecticut  It snows a lot  And then you've got a blizzard  On top of it  Of course the snow totals  Are going to be  Off the fucking chart  Yeah  But those people are used to it  Is my point  Of course  Dummies  I love it though  I can't get enough of it  Can't get enough of it  Yeah  The big events  They love a big event  Yeah  But they just look like idiots  They look so stupid  And then there's this one too 
[00:52:30]  Where they're covering this storm  And they're like  Well I hate to say this  But we're looking at another  Low pressure system  Getting organized in the Midwest  We could get a one-two punch with it  Like the one storm isn't enough  Right  They've got to make it sound like  Here comes another  Do you think they hate to say it?  Oh  Do you think they really hate to say  That another storm might be coming?  Oh you know  They're kind of like  Oh they love it  Because they know  So many more people  Are going to be watching their shit  Yeah  You know that Chad  That Chad guy 
[00:53:00]  Loves it  Chad  Loves it  Yeah  He loves it  Loves it  Damn you  Trying to give them  The little pressure readings  And then I also learned  Everyone was  Talking about this storm  And it was named Nemo  Yeah  And man  Someone set me straight  Fucking Nemo  Was invented by the Weather Channel  The Weather Channel  The Weather Channel  Is the only place  Where they name the storms  Right  Everyone else  It's just a fucking winter storm  Or nor'easter  Or whatever  I didn't know that 
[00:53:30]  The Weather Channel  The Weather Channel  Took it upon themselves  And said we're going to start  Naming these things  Yes  Like hurricanes  Yeah  Yeah  So they say  Because then people  Could hashtag it  And it's easier  For people to  To get information  Right  About a storm  If it has a name  I mean logically  It makes sense  It makes sense  But the other places  Are fucking pissed  Because it was invented  By the Weather Channel  But then  They're also saying  Alright  Let's look a little deeper  Into this  The Weather Channel  Owned by  The same company 
[00:54:00]  That owns  It's Disney  And they  That's what I heard  Oh my god  It's part of NBC Universal  Whatever it is  NBC Universal  Maybe then it's  Oh I'm sorry  It was Universal  Universal Studios  Universal  Made Nemo  That was it  Not Disney  Oh so they're doing  A little fucking high in  Let's fucking pump this one out  That's wrong too  Ah shut up  How are you saying  That's wrong you rock  Nemo is Disney Pixar  Alright so then  They're owned by  The Weather Channel  Incorrect  Put in a search 
[00:54:30]  For Weather Channel  And Nemo  Or something  I'm going with Ann  On this  Because why would you  Go Nemo  There is something  There is a tie in there  Why would you go Nemo  I read it but like  I have no clue  Maybe because  A storm is a negative thing  No  Because Disney definitely  Made Nemo  And the Weather Channel  Is definitely owned  By Universal  Is Universal  Like a branch of Disney  Or something  But I heard  Competitor  But I heard  Something  Is it really  Oh so they're trying 
[00:55:00]  To make Nemo  Look like a shithead  Oh maybe that's it  They're trying to make  It look like a shithead  Oh man  Like Nemo isn't cute  And adorable  He's a motherfucker  It doesn't make any sense though  No  Yeah it makes total sense now  Because they're just  Going to say Nemo  On TV a bunch of times  News for Weather Channel  Disney  In a negative way though  You don't want to  Just talk about it  In a negative way  It's not named  After A  Huh  I ain't gonna watch  That movie now  That this fucking storm  Hit us with  30 plus inches of snow  Alright me and Iraq  We'll just watch it alone then  I'm all about  Fuck Nemo now  Nemo 
[00:55:30]  And then other news  Stations picked up on it  And started calling it Nemo  The newspapers  Were putting like  You know  Nemo  Nemo bites  So yeah  Yeah  Does it  Yeah  Yeah it was crazy  Alright well we all got through it  It was just an amazing like  Event  Yeah  And  We have nothing else to say about it  Nope  That's all I got to say about that  And now it's raining  In New York 
[00:56:00]  They were even trying to panic everybody today  Like  And freezing rain  I was like  No it's fucking rain  Could you stop saying that  Because then people drive like assholes  Right  It was like 36 degrees out  And  It was raining  I don't see no freezy shit  I had some  I woke up  And my  My driveway  And walkway  Everything was plowed  Nice  And fucking dug out  Nice  And  And I'm looking around  It's like 
[00:56:30]  What the fuck  That's kind of cool  That's a miracle  And then like  Hours later  There's some Mexican at my door  And he's just smiling at me  And I just handed him a hundred bucks  I never saw him  I didn't know who he was  A hundred bucks you gave me to your lawn and stuff  Give me a bag of shells Jim  Wait a minute  I had it  And I went with it  Wait but you didn't set this up ahead of time  No  Now they're doing it  They're not even asking now  Didn't even ask me  You had no connection to this guy  I did hear the doorbell ring early 
[00:57:00]  Earlier  And I didn't want to get out of bed  You know  I was tired  So I just did nothing  And then when I woke up  The fucking  Like everything was plowed and dug out  And everything was great  That's smart  And then the guy just  Like some Mexican  I don't even know if he was the guy  That did the driveway  Did someone else  I just handed him a hundred bucks  And he walked away  Did someone else call him  And set it up  I don't think so  Oh my god  That's brilliant  I don't know  So basically  But you know there's some assholes out there  Going well fuck  Well good for you  I'm not paying you  I don't know  I'm not paying  I didn't ask for that 
[00:57:30]  Those guys probably had broken windows that night  And they don't know it  Exactly  Yeah fuck that  And he did a good job  It was beautiful  The whole walkway  Everything  I fucking well worth it  Of course it is  Well worth it  Don't have to deal with that shit  Especially with that much snow and shit  I don't  I'm not gonna  What am I gonna get out there and start digging  Stop it  I know how many inches I got  How many inches  Zero  Yeah  Yeah man  The snow just doesn't  Come up as high as where I live  If  I saw it go  You know  Go past my window 
[00:58:00]  But the accumulation  Wasn't even close to getting near my apartment  Could you see waking up  And seeing snow  Halfway up your window  Oh my god  Oh boy  Holy shit  That would be a great prank  To play on someone  It would be  Very involved  But man  Can you imagine  Yeah  Yeah  It's like  Well it really did snow  There were people that  There's a good gag  Is to shovel the snow  Against someone's front door  And just pile it up  The entire front door  And they open it up 
[00:58:30]  And go oh my god  Yeah  I know most of those pictures  Were set up  But they're still fun to look at  Are they set up those door pictures  Oh there absolutely are  Some of them  Oh  Yeah  That'd be a great play  Your brothers wasn't  No that was  You can tell the difference  Yeah  But there's others where  You absolutely just set it up for  You know  Everyone's trying to get their shit  Seen by a lot of eyes  Exactly  I want to do that in Hawaii  Someone opens the door  There's fucking snow  You can tell  Because when you open the door  And just see the flat like snow  Right  You can see  It's almost like  They packed it in a little bit 
[00:59:00]  Yeah  So they get the indent of the door  In the snow  Which makes the picture  Look more impressive too  Yeah  And the one picture  Where someone goes  Look at this guy  The wind blew his door open  Oh yeah  Did you see it?  Yes  With the snow inside  Inside  Obviously that's like  I don't know  Like maybe someone's  Garage or something  Yeah yeah  Shed  Shed or whatever  It didn't look like a house  I didn't think it looked like  Someone's house  Yeah you can see the layers  Like when you look at  Rock formations  Right  Like the Grand Canyon and shit  You can see like 
[00:59:30]  It's the same thing with snow  It's like  Depending on how wet it is  And stuff  And that's  The real snow  That's piled up against  Someone's door  I tweeted a picture  Late last night  A guy  His job is to clear out  A car dealership  Did you see that picture?  No  Doesn't sound like fun  It looks like all the cars  Are in water  Really?  It's unbelievable  How much snow  It was way above the hood  Yeah  It's one of the last pictures  I tweeted last night somewhere  I went with the Grammys thing 
[01:00:00]  And then I got bored  And went to bed  I'll be honest with you  I like live tweeting  These events  Yeah I got bored too  There's nothing going on there man  Yeah it was kind of dull  Yeah look at this  Oh man  Oh no that's not it  That's pretty good though  That's pretty good too  Wow  Maybe it was a retweet  That's why you can't find  Whatever  But it was like 300 cars  And a lot  All looking like that picture  That they just popped up  I'll say it's a lot  All right we can break  Eat  Yeah I want to eat 
[01:00:30]  How many live reads today?  16  Wow  And is there one right off the bat here?

[01:03:30]  Yeah  I got this one  Love that show  Mumford & Sons  They're douchebags  We tried to interview them last year  And I did a Grammys thing for Leno  And they wouldn't stop  Oh really?  Yeah I guess  They're really famous  Really famous people  They don't do that  They don't stop  Yeah  It's part of their thing  Man  I'm too busy  Yeah  Man  I kind of like their sound though  You like their sound, eh?  Probably not  Country, right?  No, I don't know 
[01:04:00]  It's like a  Sounds country-ish  What would it be called?  Pop?  Alternative folk  Alternative folk  Kind of  Is that now a category?  Fuck this shit  Yeah, it's awful  Turn it up  Is this Babble?  Babble's the album  Oh  This is I Will Wait  I've heard this before  You don't like this?  It's very hickish  It's bluegrass  I don't mind it  It needed  My right 
[01:04:30]  Irish bluegrass  Yeah?  Yeah  You like it, Sam?  You're right  You say Irish bluegrass?  It sounds like  Are they Irish?  Yeah  It's catchy  Bruno Mars  Who was just walking around  These hallways  A mere couple weeks ago  I pointed him out to you, Jimmy  Yes  I took a photo  Like I was a huge fan  You don't even know him, right?  No  He  He was very pleasant  Yeah  For a famous guy  He's very  Very small  Yeah, he's slight of frame 
[01:05:00]  He's a little guy  He's a tiny, tiny  Little guy  Sleight of frame  I'm glad  Sam picked up on this  Because they did a Bob Marley tribute last night  At the Grammys  Yeah  But it had nothing really to do with Bob Marley  Like they had artists doing their own songs  And then they had a couple Bob Marley songs in there  Like they brought the Marley brothers out  But it was halfway through the thing  After Bruno Mars and Sting had already gotten to perform their own songs  Their own songs 
[01:05:30]  I love Walking on the Moon  I'm a big police fan from back in the day  But I'm like  What  I was thinking to myself  What does this have to do with Bob Marley?  Just because  It has a reggae feel to it?  Yeah  It was like  They just took people who were influenced by Bob Marley  Oh  And then said  Play your own songs  It was fucked up  Gotcha  Instead of doing like a fresh take on a Bob Marley song  Right  They didn't have confidence enough to just have them play Bob Marley songs  Right  Throughout the whole thing  It was weird  Yeah like they  I don't know why they did it  Or why 
[01:06:00]  They just don't announce it as a Bob Marley tribute  Just have the Marley brothers come on as like a surprise  Yeah  It was Ziggy and who was the other guy?  I don't know  You don't know the other guy?  I only know Ziggy  Yeah  The other guy  Damien maybe?  Where his hair was pretty much touching the floor  Yeah  I didn't know that  That's a Ziggy  Was he good?  Were they good at the Marley brothers?  They were fine  Ziggy can sing  He sounds like Bob  It was alright  It wasn't anything special  The only thing is with the Grammys now  They're so focused on having a Grammy moment  That they announce things as Grammy moments before they happen 
[01:06:30]  Oh yes  They did that with Carrie  Yes  A Grammy moment  Ew  They got me though  And I should be smarter than this shit  They go  Coming up  A Grammy moment from Carrie Underwood  That everyone will be talking about tomorrow  I'm like  Well if everyone's going to be talking about it tomorrow  I've got to see what she's going to do  She did a basic song  What'd she do?  Nothing  How can it be like a special, spontaneous, crazy thing  If it's planned  Before it happens  Right  They said everyone will be talking about it 
[01:07:00]  But they were right  Earlier  Oh look at that  I'm going to trick you  Yes Mr. Rock  But I'm pointing out that there was a bus  That's all they wanted  Oh they don't even care, right?  Fair enough  What'd he rock?  Earlier in the broadcast  They were teasing the Carrie Underwood thing  And they said  The performance that everyone is talking about  And then right before it goes to that  It's the performance that everyone will be talking about tomorrow  And then I went  I'm not talking about this  I know we are  But we have a radio show  If I didn't have a radio show  I wouldn't be walking around talking about what Carrie Underwood did last night 
[01:07:30]  She's got to start showing some skin though, man  She wants to be like an adult performer  Enough with dresses like the preacher's daughter  She's got a really nice face  What's going on under those dresses that cover up most of her body?  That fucking Kelly Clarkson  Is just  She's giant  Fucking fat  I got a theory on that  Wow  She was never supposed to be not fat  Right  She toned it  She got all thin and shit for that American Idol 
[01:08:00]  But that wasn't her  Now she's living her life where she's supposed to be  Well, fuck that  If anybody needs an eating disorder, it's her  She's got an amazing voice though  Well, she sounds great  And she gained weight since the inauguration  You notice that?  Yes  We just saw her three weeks ago  She was wearing like winter coats and shit  And she's bigger without the winter coats on  Let me see a picture of her skinny  Let me see a fucking picture of her skinny and then fat  She is chubby  She's poorly  She was never really 
[01:08:30]  Put in skinny  She was able to kind of keep it down and keep it together  Was she?  Yeah, but she was always kind of  Put slim or  Slender  Something  Svelte  See  Oh my god  Nobody could tell even there that she's like  And yeah  Yeah, look at the arms  Those are a little big  I don't know, dude  A little big  Wow, she fucking puffed up  Yeah  Yeah  She puffed up since  Yeah, she's like a frightened blowfish  She looked like that at first 
[01:09:00]  And then  Oh boy  What song did she sing?  Natural Woman, right?  Was that her?  Yes  Holy fuck, she hit that one out of the park  Wow  Little Aretha Franklin  Man  No one will question that she can't sing, man  Oh god  That was last night?  Yep  She's almost bigger than Adele  She is Adele size  And Adele just had a kid on top of it  So she's still carrying some of that baby weight around  Adele wearing the drapes  Oh, Adele had a terrible outfit  Oh, not if you ask the fashion police 
[01:09:30]  They thought her dress was amazing  Really?  I thought Adele's flower print dress was stunning  Ugh, this guy blowing them as he's talking  You know, I never know what's a good dress and what's not  Who would?  You're a man  If it shows a clit, it was a good dress  That would be a great dress if it was just like a fucking Mary Tyler Moore fucking pantsuit  Right  With a hole cut in the front and her clit showed  I would say that's a whole month  It should have like a clit window  Yeah, I would love that 
[01:10:00]  You know, it's terrible  They're always talking about her body type and stuff  But she really pulled it off last night  Just looking beautiful  I would rather see somebody like Adele wearing this flower  And they talk about dresses  Why don't we find some clips?  Because now you got the bit  Yes  I guess the big news was  Was it Justin Timberlake was wearing Tom Ford?  Is that his name?  Tom Ford?  Tom Ford, yeah  Tom Ford  Everyone was like, oh my god  He's wearing Tom Ford, everybody 
[01:10:30]  Why does that matter?  I don't know why it matters  Why is that bad or good?  I know Anne's not a fan  But that Rihanna is ridiculous  She's actually looking beautiful  Now with her long hair  And her bright red lipstick  But she's a dummy  It's not lipstick  Because Chris Brown is  Chris Brown is just not a nice guy  You can just tell he's not a nice guy  You're not Team Breezy?  Hell no  He probably fucks her the way she needs to be banged  She's so hot  Everybody's so nice to her  But he's not  He probably stands up on the chair  And throat fucks her 
[01:11:00]  You think?  With his knees by the side of her head  Like she just likes that brutality  She's a party girl  Yeah  But although the long hair  Is pointing out the fact  That she has a giant forehead  If anyone needs bangs  It's her  Oh yeah  She has a huge forehead  She hasn't shown her forehead  In like years  Well she should cover it up  Because that's a lot of forehead  It's giant  She started sweeping her hair over it  Like probably four or five years ago  That's a comb over  She's just giving Chris Brown  A big target  Nice big fucking forehead target  Maybe it's to keep it off of her nose 
[01:11:30]  And mouth  I don't know  You probably said that in an argument once  You big forehead bitch  And then she fucking brushed it forward  For the next four years  Yeah  She's sexy though  Some black chick's got that fucking hairline  That starts in the middle of their head  It's crazy  It's like a  What's that about?  Giant forehead  I don't know  What's that about?  I don't know  No one's going to talk about Katy Perry's tits?  Katy Perry's tits  Do you see them?  Do you see those things?  Is there a Twitter account yet?  Katy Perry's tits?  I'm sure there is  I am so certain there would be 
[01:12:00]  And um  There was a memo  Basically warning these performers  Not to show what?  Too much cleavage or leg or something  Or puffy flesh  Yeah they didn't want puffy flesh  They don't like that crease under the breast  Or under the buttock  And I laughed hard at that memo  Because I know exactly who wrote it  And now those assholes are going to be controlling this shit  Oh is it those dummies?  Yeah of course it is  It's CBS who we used to work for  It's the lawyers  It's Steve and Steve 
[01:12:30]  They came up with the memo  I would guarantee it  Please be sure that buttocks and female breasts  Are adequately covered  Thong type costumes are problematic  Please avoid exposing bare fleshy undercurves  Of the buttocks and buttock crack  Bare sides or under curvature of the breasts  Is also problematic  Please avoid sheer see-through clothing  Problematic  Do you hear  That's such fucking faggot lawyer  Problematic  You hear Steve and Steve 
[01:13:00]  In that  We've had a million of those type memos  Sent to us  Is that the fucking  I don't want to say his name  But is that the same worm  That I had a meeting with  Who's like  We're not pornographers  I think so  Really jerk off  That's the Steve and Steve guys  Fuck  They're so stupid though  How were the ratings last night  Before I say what I'm about to say  I don't know if they're in yet  I kind of do watch  Some of these award shows  Because you know you're going to see  Some really hot fucking women  In some you know  Some fucking hot outfits 
[01:13:30]  Showing a lot of cleavage  And a lot of flesh  Didn't Miley Cyrus have some fucking  Scandalous dress on?  I don't know  Miley Cyrus was there  Really?  I don't think  Well maybe she was there  But no one gave a shit  I didn't see her there  And the Biebs  Was he there?  Was he shut out?  No Grammys for the Biebs?  Yeah he didn't  Oh yeah yeah yeah  His album wasn't nominated at all  He did Saturday Night Live on Saturday  I hear lackluster ratings for the Biebs  Really?  He sucked  Did he?  Yeah he's terrible  He's not a talented guy  Wait a minute  He's not 
[01:14:00]  He was hosting?  Yeah  Hosting and musical guest  Oh my god  That's so stupid  And they're all  He can't sing  He's not a good singer  He's not  And he's not a funny guy  No he's terrible  He's done  He's a fucking  Why can't people just realize  He was a teen idol thing  He gets older  And that goes out the window  He is gone  He's still got his fan base  They won a tournament  It's not as much  No it's not  No huh?  A lot of them have moved on  To One Direction right?  Yeah he doesn't have  One Direction's fan base  He's done  One Direction is that  Way bigger than Biebs?  Nah I don't think so  Look at Twitter  There's no way 
[01:14:30]  Right now?  No way  He's got 35 million people  I don't know  And they have like what  10?  Yeah but that's just  That's just lazy people  And that's over time too  Because the Biebs  He's fucking  When he got those followers  That was a few years ago  Like he was hot  When Twitter first took off  Right  So then people were really  No one unfollows really  Exactly  I gotta go through mine  There's a ton of people  I would unfollow  Oh I second that  I follow four people  I know  And I'm one of them  But they want to turn  They want to turn Justin Bieber 
[01:15:00]  Into like Justin Timberlake  So he can make that transition  His voice is not strong enough  He's not a talented guy  So he can't do it  Was he being auto-tuned  On SNL or no?  I couldn't tell  No he had a lot of reverb  Oh you watched Jimmy?  I watched  Well yeah  Can we see the performance?  I thought the monologue  I thought was good actually  The tie in to Black History Month  I thought was funny  And Bieber did the monologue?  Yeah the opening  I thought he did a good job on  But it was different  I thought he did better  Than the crowd gave him actually  Wow I didn't realize  He was hosting  I thought they would just  Give him the you know  Musical guest 
[01:15:30]  But maybe give him  A little extra  Yeah  Wow  Wow that's ballsy  On SNL's part  They've been doing that a lot though  I think they did that  With like Bruno Mars  It's probably how they  Get them to host  Right  Yeah  Yeah they give him  The whole hour  Or how they get them on  Because SNL is one thing  But you're not going to get  More views on SNL  Than you would on a YouTube video  These guys are getting  90 million views on a video  You're not going to get them on SNL  Yeah but like YouTube  Is like their fans  Ladies and gentlemen  Pause  Justin Bieber  Why is Whoopi Goldberg there?  Just a little surprise  She started the show? 
[01:16:00]  Uh uh  No this is a performance  Why is Whoopi there?  Just to introduce him  A little celebrity guest intro  She was in the monologue  Uh huh  So they obviously knew  They had to pump up Bieb  Well that was just a thing  They tied in  Yeah it's like a bit  It wasn't  Yeah it was a bit  She was part of the bit  Yeah  Oh she was part of the bit  And then  Yeah  Yeah but obviously  They're bringing some names  To kind of just pump up  I don't think Whoopi Goldberg  Is pumping up Justin Bieber  Yeah I think it was  It was a Black History Month tie in  Uh 
[01:16:30]  Yeah no  Sam  It's not all about getting  Teenagers  SNL is looking at  All the demos  So yeah  They're pumping up  The whole fucking show  In general  By bringing Whoopi  And other people in  Of course  What song did he sing?  I didn't watch any  Of the musical performances  Except the opening  I want to hear how bad he is  As long as you love me  Alright I will  Just play it  See I wasn't pretending  He said that today  Is this it?  This was the good one?  Yeah  Funny  Alright  I can't see 
[01:17:00]  Sam because he's home  Watching TV  Thank you  What is  Oh  Trying to be a man  Oh you hear the echo  A lot of reverb  We're under pressure  Seven billion people  In the world  Trying to fit in  Keep it together  Smile on your face  Even though your heart  Is frowning  But hey now 
[01:17:30]  You know girl  We bought  Sounds like something  Yes  By Jimmy  But I will  Take my chance  Say yes  As long as you love me  We could be stopping  Do you have a tat?  Yeah  We've got a couple of them  Sorry  He was just getting tatted up  Yeah  As long as you love me  I'll be flat now  Do you like the way  He touches himself  Like he's a  Black performer?  I don't know  He wants to be black  He's trying  That doesn't sound bad 
[01:18:00]  No it's okay  As long as you love me  As long as you love me  It's not showcasing anything  But his vocal acrobatic thing  That black artists do  Yeah he could do the trills  Yeah  But he has no range  What so ever  No  He's very fucking monotone  It's not terrible  It's okay  But he does  Someone  I forget who said it  He has a weaker voice  It's not a powerful  It's very thin 
[01:18:30]  No  Thin  That's exactly  It's not exactly a phenomenon  That he once was  No  He's not  We got some Grammy clips  To play  Yeah if you'd like to  Oh my Grammy's dead  We'd like to play a clip  Of the last time  She ever threw someone  A fuck  Oh my god  It's gonna be  Fucking old clip  These Grammy clips  Are like  Mary had a little lamb 
[01:19:00]  Please  Why just no  Are you offended  That I said that  No  I don't care  It was me  That threw it to her  Jesus  Imagine I fucked my grandma  Right before she died  Of course I  Of course I can imagine it  Expect nothing less  Last thing she saw  Is your fucking  The side of your awful  Baseball hat  That would be terrible  There's nothing sacred 
[01:19:30]  No  Who cares  LL Cool J  LL Cool J  We're not gonna replay  His monologue are we  God  It's horrible  The rest of the show  He talked forever  Why was he making the Grammys  About himself  That LL does now  He had nothing to do  With the Grammys  He hasn't had a song  Out in years  Yeah  Except did you notice  When he said  I've won two Grammys  So far  And I emphasize  So far  As if to say  That he's gonna make  A comeback in music 
[01:20:00]  Is his music  Really respected right now  No  I mean he's got  A couple songs  He's an OG now  He's the mama  Gonna knock you out  Thing  That's a terrible song  By the way  Mama said  Knock you out  I hated that  But it was a catchy  Little song  I hated that  And I hated  Getting Jiggy with it  By the Fresh Prince  By Will Smith  The Fresh Prince  LL is not like  Top whatever  Of all time  It's not top five  Rappers?  In no way  No I don't think so  LL  He crossed over though 
[01:20:30]  Yeah cause he got CSI  Or whatever  He's an actor  He's an actor  That's a big show right  I've never seen it  They're terrible  They're terrible  Those shows are terrible  They do real well  They do real well  Because the majority  Of people are stupid  Yes Mr. Rock  Something else they did  With the Grammys  You know when a performance  Or an award is being accepted  They would cut to artists  In the audience  Yes  Except most of the time  They were cutting to  Cast members from CBS shows  That were in the audience  Oh man  They all do that though  They do that on Fox 2 
[01:21:00]  During baseball  Yeah  Yeah  Hey look who's in the crowd here  And you could catch him  At 8pm on Friday  Yeah  Well we got LL Cool J  Opening the Grammys  We got him naming artists  Yeah  And where they're from  That's all that  The whole thing is his intro though  Huh  Like as he's naming artists  Yeah  That's part of his intro  To the Grammys  Part of his intro  That's great  And then at that point  He wouldn't stop talking  No  He had to tell everyone  Why it's important for him 
[01:21:30]  That he's hosting the Grammys  Who cares  Not  Well it was our Grammys  You're right  That's what he said  Our  What does that mean  It was our Grammys  I don't know  Give yourself a round of applause  For our Grammy  Alright  Did Jamie Foxx really say  Black people are the most talented  Fuck Jamie Foxx and his dumb ass  It's just funny  What did he say  Like black people are the most talented  Most talented people on earth  And what did the people cheer  Yeah  Yeah yeah yeah  I just wish a white guy would say that  White people are the best at math on earth 
[01:22:00]  White people are fucking faggots is why  They don't say shit  Everyone's petrified  Shut up  Well stop shutting up  Say something  For the love of Christ  You're saying enough for everyone  I really try  Thank god  I don't care that he said that  But I just  I do  If it was a white guy that said it  I care  Oh it doesn't bother me  But if a white guy said it  There'd be a problem  And that's what annoys me  Yeah I don't care he said it either  He sounds ignorant  When you say shit like that  Ignat  He said it at the NAACP awards right 
[01:22:30]  Well of course  Oh I should have said it at the Grammys  No  So of course he would say something like that  At the NAACP awards  Well you think there's no fucking media though  Or  It's closed door  No one's gonna hear it  Right  Black people are the most talented people in the world  No you can say something positive  But you know how it is  Exactly  Oh my god  Look at that  I should have watched this  Why wasn't I watching the NAACP awards  Could have gotten some real fucking anger  All I can say 
[01:23:00]  I'm so humbled tonight  I was thinking about all the stuff  That I was gonna say personally about myself  And  And I was gonna be all about me  And how I did it  And  How me  And me  And I  And I  And uh  Then you watch  Harry Belafonte  And Sidney Poitier come out  Yeah  Did they dress like fucking women  On a comedy show  Shut it  And you say to yourself  It's really not big of a deal  Uh 
[01:23:30]  What you  What you're doing just yet  Um  I had so many things  I wanted to say  But after watching  And listening to Harry Belafonte  Speak  Racist Harry Belafonte  Sometimes I feel like  Like some  Somehow I've failed a little bit  In being caught up in  What  What I do  And maybe that's the young generation  And that's what it is  Young generation  The young generation  How old are you  I'm gonna work  What are you talking about  I just want TV in the 80s  I am  What are you talking about  Is this the Apollo 
[01:24:00]  Black people are the most  Talented people in the world  I  It's  I can't explain it  Oh yeah  Yeah  That's true  You can't sit in this room  And not watch Gladys Knight sing  And go like  Golly  What in the world  That's how it ends  That's how this clip  Yeah  Golly  That should be the quote  Black guy says golly  Why is that not the headline  That's much more surprising  Than him saying 
[01:24:30]  Black people are the most talented people  Who do you  What name did he just say  Gladys Knight  Gladys Knight  Gladys Knight in the pits  Alright  I'll put Adele up against  Gladys Knight right now  Will ya  Yeah no problem  Good luck  Adele could sing her fucking  Balls off  But she's not black  So she's not  No I understand  One of the most talented people  Pointing out  There's some white people  That can fucking  Easily hang too  I don't think so  But that shit don't bother me  That's just stupid  That's just ignorant crap  Mmhmm  Ignant 
[01:25:00]  Ignant  So do we  Play the LL  Cool J stuff  I'd love to hear some of it  Cause I had  I forgot  I forgot the Grammys  Were last night  Oh you forgot  I wouldn't have watched it anyway  I have zero interest  But I did forget  I just watched for the show  I can't do it  I can't be that dedicated  I can't  I can't do it  I watch for the show  I do too  But then I started realizing  Man there's a lot of  Catchy fucking songs out there  You like the catchy  Poppy songs  That band Fun  They know a catchy song or two 
[01:25:30]  Yeah  But they certainly don't look like  A bunch of fun guys at all  A guy wearing fucking  Capri pants  Sounds like show tunes  You think?  Absolutely  Show tunes?  100%  It's very theatrical  I might like a show tune  Or two  Oh yeah  And they're not  Not catchy  I'm not disagreeing with you  Oh no  What happened?  What happened to your fucking  Show tunes?  Oh  Oh no  Show tunes  Oh no  What?  That just worries me  What happened to your girl? 
[01:26:00]  She didn't win  Best New Artist or anything?  Carly Rae Jepsen?  Exactly  You know why?  Why?  She didn't pay her dues  She knew who got her famous  She didn't want to thank him  She didn't come on the after show ever  So guess what?  Snubberoni  That's exactly what happened  You think it's based on the after show?  I'll take credit for that too  Alright  I'll see  Yeah  That as well  Enjoy going with that angle  Yeah  Is she like 30?  She's  I think she's  Yeah  She's old  28 or 29 
[01:26:30]  28?  She's been around forever  She's been around forever  My age  That's one of the most  By the way  One of the most dangerous things  For girls like that  Why?  Because she looks really fucking young  She looks like she's in her early 20s  Yeah  If that  At like 30  Very bad  Because then  Five years goes by  And you go  Oof  What the hell happened to her?  It all catches up  Yes  You know who that happened to  As far as a guy goes?  Tom Skerritt  I don't know who that is  Tom Skerritt  Who thinks of Tom Skerritt though? 
[01:27:00]  I do  All the time  Tom Skerritt on  In Alien  Alien  Very good movie  Tom Skerritt  Tom Skerritt was in it  He was a young guy  Kind of  But right on the brink  And then like a few years later  Like right after Top Gun  He was good from  From Alien to Top Gun  He held it together  And then all of a sudden  He's like on the next thing  It's like  Holy shit  Tom Skerritt's an old guy  So you're saying  Somebody needs to grab  Carly Rae Jepsen  And tell her the story  Of Tom Skerritt  Tell her the Tom Skerritt story 
[01:27:30]  Chris Warner at least  And that's a guy  Guys have a lot of leeway  Not so much girls  And Tom Skerritt  Was featured prominently  In the movie Ted  Tom Skerritt  Yes  Did you see Ted?  I certainly did  I thought it was fun  Yes  I thought it was pretty good  I thought it was a funny movie  But yes  Tom Skerritt  Stop saying his name  It's kind of fun to say  After a while  That's why I'm saying it  Yeah  It's endless  Never heard anyone 
[01:28:00]  Say his name so many times  Tom Skerritt  But he went from  Keeping it together  To all of a sudden  It caught up with him  Between Alien  And Top Gun  He held it together  And then  Ah I'm an old guy  Who?

No it was her ass  It was her ass  And by the way  Making fucking Jiffy Pop  In the front of those panties  Oh of course  It was 1970  Something  Eight  Something like that  79  A different era  Evolution  Evolution took care of that  Exactly  It looked like Tom Skerritt's beard  Was in her panties 
[01:29:30]  Look at that nice  Shaved beard  And then  Yeah so Sigourney Weaver  She looks  You know  Her age  But she looks good  Like she still looks good  She doesn't look like  Oh that's  That's the old lady  You know  Right  But she was in Alien  So who do you think  That happens to?  Tom Skerritt  Oh  He was uh  You know  He was a young guy  But he was a young older guy  You could see some hints  Of salt and pepper  In his beard  In Alien  Right?  See? 
[01:30:00]  And then Top Gun  He was like the  The seasoned veteran guy  But still you wouldn't say  Oh he's an old man  He was graying a little bit  Right  But then  They could have distinguished  Where's Tom Skerritt  In Top Gun?

[01:47:00]  And the beats were so  Holy fuck  Basic  Right, yeah  And like  It was the sound, obviously  Yeah  Speaking of getting old  Remember Dick Cheney  Shooting his hunting partner?  Oh boy  That seems like yesterday, right?  Yes  Oh, how long ago?  Seven years ago  Oh my god  There's no way that's seven years ago  Oh my god  How is that seven years ago?  Seven years  Seven years  Wow  I remember like  That Mandela guy  Yes  Nelson or Winnie 
[01:47:30]  Nelson  Yeah  Remember he was in  Captivity for 27 years?  Well  Yes  Remember that?  No, here's the other side of it  Yeah  He's already been out of that situation  For 23  Wow  How is that possible?  How old is that motherfucker?  I'm gonna guess 90  Jesus Christ  Is he 90 or is he older?  He was in for 27  And he's already been out for 23  So that's 50 years  50 years when he went in  How old was he even in?  He was like  Six months old 
[01:48:00]  He's 80 something, right?  Very racist over there  I'm gonna go with 85, 86  90  94  94  He's 94  So he was 44 when he went in?  Yeah  And spent 20  He's my age when he goes in  Right  Spent 27 years in  Oh wow  And then got out and became the president  Right  Dude  That's amazing  From this point in your life right now  Picture spending almost 30 years from now in jail  And then having a life after that  A huge life 
[01:48:30]  Go back  What's he looking at?  Oh  Yeah  Jay  Jay-Z  There's a whole bunch of pictures of Jay and Taylor Swift going nuts in the crowd  And Jay just not being impressed by anything  Jay-Z?  Yeah  That's his thing though  He can't be impressed  Why would he be impressed?  He looks like he's looking over at  What's her name there?  Jessica Biel  Yeah Jessica Biel  Looks like he's giving a stink eye  I thought  Is that  Oh instead of looking at the stage you mean? 
[01:49:00]  Yeah  He's kind of like looking over like  Yeah  He has giant hands  Jay?  Yes  He is a big handed guy  He's much more slight of frame than you would guess  I've seen him here once briefly  But it wasn't close up  You saw Jay-Z here  When he was doing Stern  Yeah  But I was like  Literally he was just  I didn't get a good look at him  That'd be kind of cool  Yeah  I'm into a book signing  Did you?  What do you mean he's small?  He's just like a small guy  No  Yeah he seems like a big figure right?  He looks like he's  Real tall  No he's a small skinny guy  No  Come on  How tall is he? 
[01:49:30]  He's not much taller than me  Yeah but you're not short  He's more popular than you  He's more popular than you too  Not you too  They're all over the world  Oh Sam got mad at that  Oh  Why'd you get mad at that?  He's not more popular than me  Jay-Z is he?  He's not  You don't think Jay-Z is more popular than you?  No  It's close  Not at all  It's not even sort of close  It is sort of close  I had good numbers in my last few gigs  Yeah  Yeah let's see Jay-Z do fucking two almost sold out shows on a Friday in San Diego  Exactly  I'd give the edge to Jim Norton on this one 
[01:50:00]  It's close though  It's close  I got a little testy  I'm sorry about that  Alright  I'll take J-N over Jay-Z any day  That's right  J-N, Jim Norton  I like that  There you go  I see  The gossip sites are abuzz because the two pigs won the Grammys  And all the hot ones got shut out  Ah  The two pigs being Adele and Kelly Clarkson  And the ones that did not win  Taylor Swift 
[01:50:30]  The Katy Perry  And who was the third one they were pointing at  Uh  What a frump  What a fucking frump  Oh and Rihanna  Rihanna  Rihanna of course  Yeah  Oh my god  Look at that  Those  Ah look  Two frumps right there  The frumps won the Grammys  Kelly Clarkson and Adele  The frumps  But they can sing  And then you scroll down one fucking thing  And you got  Oh my god  Fucking hotness  You got Playboy models  Oh my god  Although the frumps are 
[01:51:00]  Significantly better singers  Who cares  You're right  You wanna look at a frump  Why would you say significantly  I mean Kelly Clarkson and  Katy Perry's got some catchy songs  She's not a good singer  She's just  She's a catchy song  She's a terrific singer  Listen to that fireworks song  And giant titties  Giant  Biggies  Giant  I mean big  Yeah I know  Yeah I know  We all know  You see him 
[01:51:30]  And she obviously  Scroll down a little  I wanna see some  Some other thing  Keep going  Just  Shots from the night  Oh god  Look at her  Fucking  Adele from his side  Is a  Weemoth  She's brutal  It looks like somebody  Wrapped a fat body  In a rug  Like they murdered her  And wrapped her fat body  In a fucking throw rug  Yes  She is wearing a fat suit  Yeah  Wow  She's awful  That is  Look at that  Rihanna with her forehead  Who'd you rather have sex with? 
[01:52:00]  Rihanna  Rihanna  Oh my god  It's obvious  Rihanna's fucking head  She's a pretty face though  I mean Rihanna is beautiful  Bitch got a five head  She's got a five head  You're right  But look at this  Look at the size of Adele's head  Compared to her  Adele's head  Literally goes down  She's got a Robert Plant head  A Robert Plant head  That's why she's such a good singer  All the sound gets caught  In that big fat fucking head  Resonates in that head  I cherish my Robert Plant head picture  Me too 
[01:52:30]  Good one  Giant heads  Oh look  Some hats  Alright so Carrie Underwood  Was showing more skin than usual  Alright  But she makes sure  No cleavage is showing  Who are those  The Mumford's  Mumford and Sonja  Now one guy  Looks like the guy  Who I don't know his name  From the morning mashup  The one in the middle  Yeah yeah yeah  You don't like  You don't like his hat  And his pork pie hat  All the fucking hipster  We really are  Kind of in the decade  Of the hipster  It's not hip anymore  Because everyone's wearing them  I know but it's still  Like a hipster  The fucking pork pie hats 
[01:53:00]  And the wacky instrument  That you bring out on stage  To put  The dub fucking hipster beards  You don't like that  This is the Lumineers  The Lumineers  Wait start that over again  I can't stand  Hold on  I was enjoying that  You don't like the band  No  Big band  I got a question for you  Yes sir  Listen to the first  Five seconds of the song  Tell me what band  Sounds like  Okay  Let's have a little  Fucking fun here  A little fun 
[01:53:30]  Sabbath  No not  No  The actual vocals  John Lennon  Singing  We all shine on  It's more the sound  Of the vocalist  Than the harmonizing  It's by me  Wow  This might have been  A big fucking waste of time  What do you think?  I'm too scared to say  No you might be right  I might either be right 
[01:54:00]  Or people are going to kill me  You may be right  I may be crazy  Hey but it just may be  A lunatic  You're looking for  I turn out the lights  Give me a note  This one  What should I do?  I'm scared to say now  Oh come on  Who do you think?  Super Tramp  Oh bullshit  You don't think  I saw that coming  I don't know  Super Tramp 7  Not this part  Just the first  The first part  I could see that  Yeah  Go again to the first part  I can see what you mean  So just to bring it together  To save my ass 
[01:54:30]  Hit it  Just that singing style  No?  No  Take a look at my girlfriend  Girlfriend  She's the only one I want  That's what I hear  Is that band big Sam?  Super Tramp?  No  Well they used to be  Yeah the Lumineers are big  They're new  You know but this song is huge  They're so fucking hip  I mean they're a little  They're very cool  No they're not  They're so not cool 
[01:55:00]  Why are they cool?  They got hats and shit  Yeah  Is that the Illuminati guy  Right there singing with  Elton John?  Ed Sheeran  Who's he?  He's got another  That was the guy  That I look like I guess  Cause his hair is almost  The same color as me  Ed Sheeran's A-Team song  Is big right now  Oh what's that?  She's A-Team  I took pride in the fact  That I was up on music  Until  I think I've been out  About two years now 
[01:55:30]  Unfortunately  Yeah  I gotta get back into it  You think  Two years?  Yeah  Probably right when  I started having kids  I started not being able  To keep up with it  Hits one is bumping  All these songs early  Really?  Yeah and they're becoming  Big hits  You know what happened too?  I'll tell you what  The fuck happened  I'm like an alt-rock guy  And what's that fucking  Channel we got?  XMU?  No the  The Madison channel  Oh  Alt Nation  That's what happened  I'll tell you why  I don't know music anymore  I gave up on that 
[01:56:00]  That's the channel I liked  Their playlist was  20 songs  And I tapped out  A year later  I go back to it  They're still playing  The same 20 fucking songs  And then they sneak  One lousy new song  In every once in a while  Alt-rock is like  Not  Nothing's happening  Unbelievable though  It's crazy  That's why I started  Tapping out  I couldn't listen to  The same goddamn songs anymore  And it makes it harder  To discover new music  On your own obviously  When you're this age  Oh 
[01:56:30]  What 30?  Kids at home  You know  Pushing 40  80-ish  Why is Ellen DeGeneres  Looking at Katy Perry's  Dude  She's funny  Ellen DeGeneres  She's just trying to be fun  She's being goofy  Sitting there like a teen  At the fucking movies  Oh you saw her  With her chick  Oh yeah  Just with his  Well  Arm around her  Who is the his?

Ellen's not  Ellen doesn't look bad  For a woman in her 50s  Have you ever seen  Ellen DeGeneres  Without makeup?  They do amazing things  With makeup in Hollywood  There was a video  That came out  She was on a boat  Without makeup  It was a horror show  She looks like David  Did you ever look at yourself?  You don't look at yourself  God Twitter  The concept of Twitter  Was fucking brilliant  It's just too bad 
[01:57:30]  Yeah  Being taken over  By idiots  Look at that  You still think  Whoa  She looks like  And that's not as bad  Right there  Who does she look like?  She looks like a guy  Right there  David Bowie  There's some guy  Andy Dick  Yeah  A little Andy Dick  A little  Alright go back to the  So Ellen's just having fun  Looking at Katie Perry's tits  She was up there with Beyonce  Making her Beyonce uncomfortable  Because when they were presenting  Justin Timberlake and Jay-Z  I saw  Ellen just stared at her  Just stared at her  Like wow  Was it part of the joke 
[01:58:00]  Or did she get caught staring at her?  No  She was kidding  It kind of worked  It did work  Ellen has no qualms  About being a fucking  You know  She loves pussy  Girl loving  Yeah  Loves pussy  Oh yeah  You know how much great it must be  For her to be out of the closet  Like you watch her old video  You ever see  She was a funny stand up  I think she's very funny  I remember her from 20 years ago  But she had like  She looked like Regan  She had like a mullet  And this kind of like  Weird guy outfit  In a tucked in shit  Like real awful 
[01:58:30]  80s guy clothes  Terrible  All the female comics  Look like that  Paula  What's her name?  Paula Poundstone  But she's also gay though  Yeah  I think she's gay  Yeah  I think so too  I like to remember Ellen  From such movies  As Bill Pullman  And her  And Mr. Wrong  If you remember that one  No  What was that?  Oh you see the cover of that one?  Pop up the old movie poster  For Mr. Wrong  She was in Mr. Wrong?  Oh  Was she ever?  Was she playing his love interest?  Of course  Look at this  Look at this 
[01:59:00]  Ah  He's Mr. Wrong  Oh look out  Oh look out  Oh no  She's like  Guy  Well after Mr. was a semicolon  Mr. is wrong  Oh right  Mr. Wrong  But see Ellen's trying to joke about her  That she's staring at Katy Perry's tits  But she's getting really turned on by doing that  Of course  Yes  Be like any of us doing it  Any of us 
[01:59:30]  I'm just goofing  But it would actually just be an excuse to stare at them titties  Yeah  And her show  Like it's gotta be the greatest job ever  She's a lesbian  And then she like starts her show dancing  And then goes into the crowd  And just fucking bumps donuts  With all the fucking  Yeah  Housewives from around the country  She picks like the hot ones  And goes over to them  And starts grinding  And then she goes home  And tells her  Whatever there  Oh no  It's part of the job  But you're right  She'll fucking  She'll look at the audience  And go  Wow  She's hot  She's hot 
[02:00:00]  She's hot  So I'm gonna go down their rows  I'm gonna fucking rub up against these  It's gotta be the greatest gig ever  They're in the aisles scissoring  Right  Scissoring  Yes  I love the scissor  That's gotta just leave you needing more  Yeah  Oh my god  Look at this  It's fucking cool  John Mayer's dressed like fucking his shaft  Yeah what was John Mayer doing  I like that  Blue velvet fucking suit  Is that blue or purple?  Well John Mayer  Purple yeah  That's nice  He's trying to kind of downplay his whole image and stuff  He doesn't want people to think that he's this over the top guy anymore 
[02:00:30]  He kind of proved it at the grounds  Didn't he?  Yeah you're right  Huh?  Just trying to downplay everything  He was on Sunday morning yesterday  Trying to say  Yeah I'm just  You know I moved to Montana  I'm not the same guy I used to be  He's fucking Katy Perry  Yeah he is  And the guy goes  Well if you're trying to downplay all this  Why are you going out with one of the most famous women in the world?  And he goes  I can't hope who I fall in love with  Oh god  I can't help wearing purple suede to the Grammys  He's just blending in  But he does it to himself  Because he really is trying to downplay it 
[02:01:00]  He says he's trying to downplay all that  And then he shows up at the Grammys like this  He wants the attention  But the thing is about John Mayer  But he doesn't want people to think he wants the attention  He only wants positive attention  And so when he starts getting negative attention  He goes  Oh no I don't want  I don't  You know I'm not a public guy  That's everyone I think though  We all kind of want positive  You know  Well  Yeah we don't pretend to not want attention  When negative attention starts  Yeah he's basically saying he doesn't want any attention  You do  He's  But you know what it is  It's like he hasn't sung in a couple years  Because of his voice  Like his publicist is a genius  With the fact that he must be fucking packing a big log 
[02:01:30]  Because he is in  He's still really relevant  And he's always in fucking  Showing up in magazines  It's like the guy hasn't sang in two years  And he's still like  You don't realize it's been that long  You're like oh fuck  Yeah  That's just  That's a great publicist  He has sang though  He sang recently  Did he  Oh did he  Okay  And he got Botox to his vocal cords or something I think  I think he did  I was half watching when this was on yesterday  Didn't he do it right though  Like as opposed to a quick fix  He actually went the right way and got them fixed properly 
[02:02:00]  Yeah I think so  That's why  Yeah that's why he was out for so long  Because it takes a long time to heal  I mean he had just put out an album  And he didn't get to tour it  Because  He stopped singing  Wow  It's a ballsy move  Yeah  But you know  I guess all you gotta do is just keep banging  Katy Perry and his other  Oh my god  He banged her too  Yes he did  Taylor Swift  Allegedly  Did he  He fucks everyone  Did he bang her though  He's the best  I mean you know  They were an asshole  What's wrong with that guy 
[02:02:30]  He's great  Eat him  But she doesn't like  She doesn't really like sex or guys  You don't think so  Nah  Nah she's doing it for her career  He probably took out that big mayor dick  And slapped her in the face  And scared her  Back into fucking teeny bands  He's got a big piece huh  I mean he has to  I think we heard that  He's a giant head and big hands  He's gotta have  He's fucking all cocky  I think he plays the guitar  Like he'll be clapping over his head  And you'll still hear the guitar playing  Like wow  That's pretty  Oh there's Ellen  Like hey  She used to be hot 
[02:03:00]  How old does she think  Her wife  She kind of  She's starting to look like that  Catwoman woman  Photobomb going on in the back  Yeah who's that  Kelly Clarkson  She's looking like  Unless she's just eating  She's starting to look like  Catwoman from the Batman TV show  Ah right  Eartha Kitt  No the other one  I know  Sorry  I should just  I should just  One with that  Who's that  Ellen Cool J and Chuck D  Chuck D came out  At the end  What'd he do  LL did like a medley 
[02:03:30]  Of Repshit  Yeah and Chuck D came out  A vegetable medley  Was it good  Yeah  Was Flav there  No  Was Flav or Flav lamping all over the place  He's lamping  I'm lamping  I'm lamping  I'm stone cold lamping  I don't know what that means  Flav  Is  Are those two an item  They're married  Married with a kid  Who are they  Justin Timberlake  I swear to you  I did not know who that was  That's what a pop culture  I'm not joking 
[02:04:00]  I did not  Either of them  No  Justin's almost got  What's his name  Wolverine look there  Hugh Jackman  Hugh Jackman hair  He's got a weird  He's got a weak voice  Singing voice  His voice is weak  No just when he talks  Oh  Sounds a little effeminate  Right  Yeah  And he was doing falsetto last night  And it looked like  That was effortless for him  Oh yeah  Like it's not even  A tough thing for him to do  Are you making alligators  Nope  No okay  That's none of my fucking business 
[02:04:30]  I'm just saying  Hey they're Hollywood stars  It's everyone's business  I guess  Public figures  Don't you know  Public figures  It's like when fucking Rupert  Went over Jerry's house  Hey you know  You're a star  You gotta put up with this  It's part of the life  Well they're allowed to just drink champagne  In the audience like that  Well Jay can do it  You think he brought it in  Every once  Yeah  Or no he didn't bring it in  One of his people brought it in  How great would it have been  If someone went up to him  And said oh Mr. Z  You're gonna have to 
[02:05:00]  You're not allowed to do that here  I'm gonna take that bottle from you  Did you hear him when  When he accepted the award  What award  He went out  I think best rap collaboration  What award  But see the guy behind him  That's wearing the  Boys in the Hood baseball cap  Yeah  That's the producer  Oh he was pretty funny with that  Yeah he  They started playing the exit music  And then Jay-Z got behind the mic  Cause he hadn't said anything  And they cut off the exit music right away  Cause it's Jay-Z  And he just goes  Yeah I wanna thank the swap meet  For his hat  Cause he was just making a  Boys in the Hood hat  Yeah boys in the Hood hat 
[02:05:30]  John Mayer was dressed like  Willy Wonka last night  That's good  P underscore sub  Very good  Did they really stop the music  When he got up  Oh yeah  Why would they do that  Respect  Yeah but they do this  Respect  They don't care who you are  They do it at the Oscars  They do it for actors  It doesn't matter  If you win an Oscar  They'll shut you up  Very scared of him  Are they?  He's the man  Yeah  He's got a lot of pull  Yeah  In the  You know  Do you think he might be  He's one of the biggest guys  In the music  That looks gay  They're performing  Want to hear a little of that?  Yeah  Please 
[02:06:00]  Okay  Justin Timberlake  Performing his new song  Which is kinda catchy  Is it  Is this  Jamiroquai?  He's a good voice  Yeah  He had the whole orchestra thing behind him right? 
[02:06:30]  That whole thing  Two years ago  Yeah  Brewer did that  Everyone's done that  Fucking what's his name  From the Stray Cats did it 
[02:07:00]  Frank Sinatra  Frank Sinatra did it  Benny Goodman did it  Perry Como  Perry Como  Kiss did it with the symphony in Australia  Tony Bennett  Metallica  It's okay  It's kind of boring  It is a little boring  It's not as upbeat  It sounds like a million other things  He's matured as an artist I think  But that doesn't stand out at all  It sounds like an  It sounds like  The non-rap song  They play in an 80's rap movie 
[02:07:30]  Oh  Like that's the fun  Frolicking like music  During break-in  Is it?  Yeah like when they're all  The rappers  A montage scene?  Yeah  They'll run by a lake  And they'll show you  They'll be in fun  Right right right  Goofing off and warming up  Oh that's a good one  That's what that sounds like  Yeah  Jay-Z comes in like right there  Good for him  Oh he does?  Oh yeah  I'm tired of Jay-Z  Everyone is  He's everywhere  Everyone is  Yeah enough with the Jay-Z  Enough with the power couple  Nobody's tired of him  No a lot of people  Are tired of Jay-Z enough  And then he comes in  And just  Selling records  We both are  And he does the same rap 
[02:08:00]  He does the same rap  In every song  Oh please  Same words and everything  Can we hear Jay-Z?  Because I really don't know  Any of this shit  I know like two songs  99 Problems with the bitch  Every white person knows that song  White person?  Yes  Oh you're not white  Now you're officially not white  In the black community?  What the fuck are you?  I'm white and I know that song  I know the other one  With the uh  The thing  Oh okay good  Um  Uh  Uh  From Annie or something  Hard Knock Life?  Yeah yeah  I know that one too  That's one of the new ones right?  No 
[02:08:30]  Yeah that's pretty new too  I thought that was a new hit  New  Number one hit tune  What the fuck is that?  That don't look like  No peanut butter to me  Oh Jesus  What happened there?  Whatever  See it's that New York New York song  It's obvious  Yeah you can hear it  New York  I'm waiting for the New York New York part  This is trouble season  Time for taxidum for no reason  All saints of my angels  I am so fucking sick of hip hop 
[02:09:00]  Fucking sick of it  Just injecting it into every fucking other song  It sounds like you can't keep up  Like there's too much words or something  It's not good live  Hip hop is not really good live  It stinks live  He might be the best live rapper  In concert  Oh good  Good for you  Oh good  Good for you  My name was good last night  I don't like it live  No  No  No man  It's terrible  It's terrible  It loses something  I don't know why it loses something 
[02:09:30]  But as opposed to traditional singing  It loses something live  Well because like  In actual rap songs  Like on the record  They're so overproduced  It's crazy  This is the Bob Marley tribute  This is how it started  Is that Bruno Mars  Yeah  Yeah  Bruno Mars  I like this song  Yeah  It's his song  It's his song  What does this have to do with Bob Marley  You can tell he's influenced  He's dead  He's in heaven  He's influenced  Yeah yeah yeah 
[02:10:00]  Yeah yeah  Did Bob Marley have a few songs  They could have just had fun with  I think they decided  Let me  Let us go with something  That will show the influence  That Bob Marley has had  On our careers  On our successful careers  Either that or it's self-centered asshole  Record executives  And labels and artists  Who want their own shit to be sold  They're gonna sell our stuff  Yeah  But this makes you think of the police  Not Bob Marley  Yes  It really does  Why?  It sounds like a police song  It does right?  Yeah  It's a good tune though 
[02:10:30]  Yeah it is  When's the hip hop come in?  Destroy it  Because you like this so much  Without hip hop  I'll tell you one thing about Jay-Z  Yeah  I'll give you a little, Sam  He is the coolest fucking guy out there  I just remembered something  Yeah there was another song he did  He did the Justin Timberlake  But later on he did another performance  Yeah 
[02:11:00]  He's like I don't need to be fucking backstage  Give me a fucking mic in my seat  Yeah  They give him a mic  And then he casually walks up on stage  From his seat  That was the Justin Timberlake song  Oh it was that one  Yeah  Oh okay  It was funny because I was like  Oh Jay's probably gonna perform  With Justin  And then it's like wait  He's in the seat  How the fuck  But then Jess was like  Well they showed him in his seat  And he was wearing his ear monitors  So he's obviously not staying in his seat  Jess ruins all surprises  Shit  Detective  Yeah she's ruining everything  What's going on there  Detective shit  But that's kind of  That's some cool ass shit  Yeah  All of a sudden you get up out of your seat 
[02:11:30]  With a mic  And walk on stage  For your part  See and then he just shows  For the rest of the Grammys  With his ear monitors  Just hanging by his tuxedo  He don't give a fuck  Do you think Jay-Z has an entourage  With him when he travels  He probably has a person or two  Yeah  I think he has security  Maybe one  Yeah  Does he have one guy with him or more  He probably has more than one  Where's the security for all these guys  Is there a holding room  No I think they sit around them  No they don't  No  No way  For every celebrity  There's no way  Because all those guys have people  You're telling me this guy  Sitting next to Portia DeRozzi  And Ellen is a celebrity  No 
[02:12:00]  He's a boxer  They don't give them all  Sam just gave us a face  They don't give them all seats  Man that's  Those are celebrity sets  That's what I'm saying  There's so many  So many seats  Would be taken up  By their own people  Yeah  And once you're in there  Who's going to bother  Jay-  What is Ellen going to  Attack Jay-Z  You would  With a camera  Yes I would  For two seconds  Yes I would  Oh sorry Jim  I guess I would  Jim takes all the fun  Out of it  Yes  Problem  When does  When does 
[02:12:30]  This thing come out  After the  Ah the right  The whole song  On this fucking thing  What  You don't like this  Well it's  By the way  Speaking of somebody  Who can't keep up  Or stay on melody  What are you talking about  He's just rushing through  He's not rushing through anything  He does that tantric stuff  Just shut up  Relax  I mean long  Exactly  Yeah you try fucking  For 20 straight hours  He loves that fucking  Long fuck  That's right  He has me beat  By 19 hours 
[02:13:00]  And 54 minutes  This fucking sting guy  Doesn't age though man  This voice is ridiculous  Yeah  Mumbly  Mumbly  What's up  Not even together  Sounds good  I want to sing this to a girl

[02:19:00]  For your new show  Parts Unknown  Coming to CNN  Where you're just kind of  Hanging out on the rowboat  It looks like a little rowboat  In the middle of like  The Amazon or something  Just taking it all in  Casually  Yeah  Off the record  It's a rock quarry in Atlanta  Oh  Oh that's it  I heard some guy  Is it really  Man that looked really  I swear to god  I'm like wow  Where is this amazing place  That looked treacherous  You know we're on here  No  Yeah  Oh this is how we start  He's like whoops  Oh so you just gave us 
[02:19:30]  An exclusive  A rock quarry in  Kuala Lumpur  Yeah that's where it was  Wow it really  Well they pulled it off  It looks like a far away lawn  Yeah  I just got back from Libya  And Tangier  And Libya was a trip  Off the record  It was Jersey  It was Newark  It was a very very very tense shoot  And we  Really  Security was an issue  And we arrived  Just in time for the British government  To say you know  No sensible person should be here  There have been specific threats  Against westerners  Bah bah bah 
[02:20:00]  So suddenly  Our already kind of tense shoot  Becomes riding around  With the guarded by militia  These militia dudes  From Miserato  Who were the sort of prime movers  In the revolution  And it was an amazing experience  Other than the fact  That we're driving around  In these procession of cars  Filled with you know  Young men with automatic weapons  And hand grenades  Rolling around on the floor  Wow  They were all guys  Who'd been playing  Playstation a year and a half ago  They were medical students  In Montreal  Shopkeepers  You know guys with IT jobs 
[02:20:30]  Just ordinary people who  When the revolution came unexpectedly  And they realized  Jesus we have a chance here  To overthrow this son of a bitch  They all came back  And all you know  Became weapons specialists  Like overnight  And the weapons they put together  These guys are facing  You know Russian tanks  With pickup trucks  That they've sort of pimped out  With homemade rocket launchers  Made out of PVZ pipe  Powered by  With hair dryers 
[02:21:00]  As the trigger system  Jesus  Crossbows  Big crossbow  Molotov cocktail launchers  This before or after Benghazi  Went over there?  Just a couple of weeks ago  Oh wow  Okay  You had balls  To go over there  After that happened?  He just got back  I didn't realize  If it was just got back  Every couple of months  Wow  The mood there  Look there were a lot of people  Trying to put together  A country from nothing  You know  They had no plans  To have a revolution  They thought they'd be stuck  With this guy for 40 years  Overnight it became clear  Wow  This might happen  So you know  There are no traffic cops  In Tripoli 
[02:21:30]  It's people  Volunteers  Young kids in camo pants  Trying to run a country  They know that there's going to be  A lot of problems  And a lot of shit going on  For  They're saying like  Probably five years  Maybe even ten years  To get their act together  But they want to  By and large  Believe it or not  Libya  Tripoli  Our first night there  The main square  Martyr Square  Was filled with like  Libyan skater boys  You know  You know  Hipsters  Inline skaters  Kids throwing fireworks  Guys doing donuts 
[02:22:00]  Troy Muhammad Kwan  Pretty inspiring  Wow  Why do they hate westerners  Because westerners  Kind of helped  Why would they say  That it's not a good place  For westerners  When westerners  Kind of helped  Get Gaddafi overthrown  At the end of the revolution  There were these  Massive amounts of arms  Just laying there  I mean literally  You want to  You want to  Rocket launch  The whole army  Has just been  Gone to see you  So  You know  It is a neighborhood  Where there are  Bad people  Who would like  To hurt us  Clearly  And they're very 
[02:22:30]  Aware of it  And they're  Trying to deal  With the problem  As best they can  Considering they got  This sort of  You know  Fledgling  Not particularly  Together government  Yeah there are  People there  Who hate us  And would do us  Harm  There are people  Running around  With guns  With all sorts  Of agendas  But by and large  Everyone I spoke  To there  They said  You know  We don't want  Western money  We don't want  Western control  We just want  We have oil  We like our place  At the table  Like Europe  They use Europe  As an example  A lot  So I didn't get  Any  I got a lot  Of thumbs up  And we said 
[02:23:00]  We were CNN  People would say  CIA  And they put  Oh god  You know  People were  Very very  Very cool  With toss  And we ask  We ask you this  Every time you're in  And you're just not  Scared in that situation  I've lived a long  And productive life  I'm not a particularly  Heroic guy  I don't want to  You know  I don't want anybody  Nailing my nutsack  To a chair  Particularly  But  What gets you  Through that  It was really  Exciting  Who gets to  Go to a country  Right after  The worst  Dictators 
[02:23:30]  In  Most maniacal  Dictators  In history  Has been toppled  And see something  Like this  Where it's really  Talking 2016  It's kids  It's like imagine  The kids you grew up  With at the mall  Got to overthrow  A government  And figure out  How to run a country  It's a kind  It's an historic  Moment for me  It was like  The Spanish Civil War  But the good guys won  Right  Any threat  Yeah  Come across anything  That you weren't  Like oh boy  Or uncomfortable  Just strongly uncomfortable  You're very aware  That you know  There are bad things 
[02:24:00]  Going on around you  You know  Getting it out  Of the car  You know  You're riding there  In a car full of weapons  Where nobody has a uniform  And there's no cops  No  I mean  No  Actually it was pretty inspiring  Were you packing  Were you packing a piece  Going full Geraldo  Like I'm walking around  Yeah yeah  With the  With the friggin gun  Remember that  Geraldo  I am armed  Just in case  What a dramatic ass  He really is  Overdramatic dude  You were aware  Of where the weapons  In the car were 
[02:24:30]  In a worst case scenario  Yeah  But nobody  You know  I think that would be  Considered  Even the worst case scenario  That having something bad  Happen is  You know  The on camera talent  Starts popping off  Yeah  Are you excited  You're excited to be  Joining CNN huh  I am  You're going to do  Real well there  I'm having a lot of fun  And they've been completely  They've let me do  Whatever I want  We shot in Burma  So far  We shot a really  Kooky show in LA  That pretends that  No one but Korean Americans  Exists in LA  It's a shot entirely  In Koreatown 
[02:25:00]  From the point of view  Of Koreans  So we've been  Doing some really  Trippy  Really interesting shit  And most importantly  We've been getting  To go to really  Interesting places  Like Libya  And Burma  That we never  Ever would have  Been able to do  And the gist of it  Is just looking  At different cultures  And what not  It's all about me  Having a good time  Alright  That's good  He just moved over  To another network  Gotcha  I found that  If you show up  At a place like Libya  Where you're not  Presenting yourself  I'm here to report  The hard news  Let's talk about Benghazi  That if you show up 
[02:25:30]  And say look  I'm just interested  What do you guys  Eat and drink  What do you do for fun  People lower their defenses  And tell you a lot of things  That they might not tell  Well with that said  Because I'm a big fan  Of all the shows  You've done over the years  What do they like  To drink in Libya  Well they don't  They do  They don't really  It's a Muslim country  So you cannot buy beer  All the major beer guys  Have non-alcoholic beer there  Oh wow  It's called  No fun beer  Every once in a while  You will bump into somebody  Who has something called  Boca in their pocket  Which is a 
[02:26:00]  Quite good moonshine  Yeah  So some people over there  You know  Kind of skating the rules  Every once in a while  You know  People will  Some people  You think when they develop  This new country though  They'll start escaping  More of the rules  Or they're going to be  Stay traditional  I think  They're going to have to find  A balance  A balance  Between people  Who are  You know  Very traditional  Very devout  And people  Who absolutely 
[02:26:30]  And most people  I spoke to  Absolutely committed  To having a secular government  You know  Whether or not  You go to the mosque  Five times a day  Or not  They would like  Their government  More or less  To be along secular  And European lines  Gotcha  Were there any nice hotels  Or anything like that there?  Yeah  There was a brand new  Marriott  That's unoccupied  They built it  At an awkward time  We stayed in a major chain  That was staying in  I stayed at the  Angelina Jolie suite  In Misrata  Which was sort of kooky  Oh look at you  And yeah  It was something 
[02:27:00]  I did consider  You know  It's nice  Should I sniff this sheet  I was  Exactly  Sleep on the toilet  I'll tell you that  She's got stones  She was there like  A year earlier  And you know  Misrata is no picnic  It's like  Wow man  Where's Misrata?  It's about  A couple hours  A few hours away  Along the coastline  From Tripoli  So you have much more access  Because of CNN  They just know how to get you  In and out of these places  Where the other channel  Would live  They report from places 
[02:27:30]  Like that  So they have fixers  And contacts  And they're not afraid of that  Because they're  You know  Look  It was hard doing  What I was doing  And I'm not out there  With people actively  Shooting at me  Yeah  Like you know  There are CNN guys  Who've been  Reporting from like  Anbar province  For years  So if anything  And it's exhausting  To live in a high security  Situation for a week  But most of these  CNN guys  Have been doing this  For years  Yeah  They must blend in 
[02:28:00]  Though  Battle weary  There's no blending in  When you're  You know  With a camera crew  Oh wow  Good point  Anybody with a cell phone  Is 15 minutes away  From calling their buddies  So  Doesn't everybody in the world  Know CNN though  They kind of  I guess  Everyone in the world  Knows  So they sort of  Leave them alone  A little more  Yeah  I'm assuming so  You don't hear about  A lot of CNN guys  Getting attacked  Do you  Look  A lot of journalists  A huge number of journalists  Have been killed  In the last few years  Like  We're well  I think we're close to 200  But it doesn't discriminate  Jim  No but I mean 
[02:28:30]  But it doesn't discriminate  It seems like CNN  Can go places  That a lot of other people  Would not be able to go  Oh okay  For some reason  That camera crew  They just  They'll talk to you  Stuart Harrington  The journalist  Who did  Restropo  Who was just killed in  Yeah that's fucked up  I'm not sure  Was it a  Misrata or Benghazi  A while back  Was he targeted  Or was it one of those things  Where he was just  In the wrong place  Wrong time  Wrong place  Wrong time  But  I know in Syria  They killed that woman  Like they wanted to kill her  I forget her name  She had like lost an eye 
[02:29:00]  Yeah yeah yeah  Well she'd been at it  For years and years  And years and years  In really dangerous places  And  How do you do that  Kind of caught up  Yeah  For me it was a picnic  Right  Right right right  We're a little distracted  Because the Pope is resigning  Did you see this yet  Yeah  Yeah  You know  The only reason we bring it up  Is this has never really happened before  Yeah  Why does the Pope have to resign  I don't get it  From 14  The last time  Was 14  17  This happened  14  15  Yeah  14  15  Because they want somebody 
[02:29:30]  They want somebody younger  And much more able  To be  To address scandal  Or to address anything  Like the old guys  Just aren't able to lead  The church in bad times  You want a Pope that could Skype  Yeah  You want a Pope that knows  With a Twitter account  Right  Exactly  The Dalai Lama has a Twitter account  I know  Yeah  Do you follow anybody  No he doesn't  Of course not  He was goofing on the  On the Grammys last night  The Dalai Lama  Yeah just tweet along  Hashtag Grammy  Right  He's a fun guy  Is he fun  Oh he's hilarious 
[02:30:00]  We saw him  We were in an elevator  With the Dalai Lama  Very cool  Me and Anthony  Yes we were  He's actually a pretty good guy  From interviews  I've seen with him and stuff  He's kind of chuckling  He has a good time with himself  As the Chinese try to  You know  Destroy him  We went down to Atlanta  For a radio job  And yeah  We're at the Ritz-Carlton  And we walk in the elevator  And it's us and the Dalai Lama  And I think one of his guys  Right  Yeah  He's always got security  How tough is that  Before I forget 
[02:30:30]  I want to thank Jim  For doing the roast  Oh yeah  A little back man  It was funny as hell  I heard it was great  You're welcome  It was fun  It was fun  Yeah  It was very  I didn't eat though  I should have eaten  There's so many good chefs  Everybody's eating  And we're up there  You know  Sitting behind the dais  That was  We got the butt end  Of the deal there  But it was  I got off easy  I thought  How did Guy Fieri  Hold up  I sat next to Guy actually  Rock and roll  He got a beating  Stream  He got a beating  Yeah  Mario got a beating  Gilbert killed Mario 
[02:31:00]  Did he  Yeah  Oh man  You don't want Gilbert  Getting  He got into one of his  Gilbert loops  He's so fat  And he just did  Mario is so fat  Mario Battaglia  So fat  He just wouldn't stop  He just kept coming back  The repetition  It just makes it funnier  And funnier  Yeah  And then he would stop  And then it would just be  Mario  So people already laughed  You were awesome  Thank you  I thought Rachel Ray  Had the line of the night  What'd she say  She said 
[02:31:30]  You gotta love it  She's talking about Mario  She's gotta love Mario Batali  You know  Any guy who'll lend you  Is scrunchie  You're giving him a BJ  Oh shit  I thought that was  Bonnie was great  Bonnie  Bonnie was fantastic  I'm sitting there with my agent  And my publisher  And I said  We gotta sign this woman up  We gotta get this woman  To write a book  She's unbelievable  And so we're hoping  To do a book with her  She was hilarious  She's hilarious  Wow  Killed  Killed  Artie was on  Who else was on  That fucking  She's like a speedboat 
[02:32:00]  With a giant cruise ship anchor  Holding her down  Rich Voss  Her husband  We're friends with them  Yeah  Yeah  She's really  She's really being held down  By a dumbbell  Well we're hoping  To publish your memoirs  If everything goes well  Very cool  Amazing life  Hey  And you got the big show  On ABC too  We should promote the taste  Yep  A lot of fun  A lot of fun  Do you come up with  Sorry to interrupt  Do you come up with these  Or does someone say  Hey do you want to do  Because you're always 
[02:32:30]  You're really active man  You've always got something  Happening  With the taste  They came along  These are people I knew  Who do big network shows  And they came along  And asked if I was interested  In a big noisy  Flashy studio  Network production  Something I'd never done before  But I was able to get in  At the ground floor  Help develop the idea  Pick who else was on the panel  With me  Pick the guest mentor chefs  And I'm wary 
[02:33:00]  It seemed like the dumbest  Most out of character thing  I could possibly do  Which frankly had an appeal for me  You know  Somebody says to you  I got an F-4 Tomcat  You know  A jet  You know  You want to fly it off  This carrier deck  And it's like  Okay I don't know  How to fly it  Yeah but  It sounds fun  It's probably a really bad idea  But somebody's just  Handing me the keys  To this massive jet plane  Right  You're kind of  You're kind of obligated  To do it  It's an irresistible impulse  Yes  In the end  You know  I travel 
[02:33:30]  For 10 years now  I've been traveling  Like 250 days a year  So the prospect of  Waking up in the same bed  In L.A.  For a month  Two months in a row  Commuting to work  And working with friends  I mean I love  Nigella Lawson  And Ludo  We're really good friends  So it was  It was a really fun experience  Good for you  I do it again  In a hot second  I'm hoping to do it again  And it's one last  Lousy spoonful  When you do 60 of those  In a day  It's  Oh really  Really 
[02:34:00]  But it's really great  I mean the set  Is like the end  Of a Bond film  It's like the inside  Of a volcano  So what exactly  Is the show  Do we do it justice  It's pretty much  A lot of up and coming  Chefs  Oh okay  It's a blind  Basically the producers  Did a nationwide  Casting call  So  They get like  They narrowed down  To 60 people  Okay  And of course  Sprinkled in there  People who  Are  You know  They're interesting  And they're hoping 
[02:34:30]  That we  Then the four judges  We basically  Choose our teams  Based blind  On spoonfuls  And then you find out  Afterwards  Who you've picked  For your team  Right  I ended up  I ended up  Picking four  Very attractive women  Really  Which you know  I had absolutely  No  Which is what  It's interesting  You assume certain  Things from this  Mouthful of food  Okay it's going to be  You know  If it's a barbecue  Somehow you have  These gender associations  It's going to be  Some dinty  Moore looking  Motherfucker  In there  I ended up with  Four really smart 
[02:35:00]  Really good cooks  Feisty  Would be an understatement  And then you  There every week  Once you've selected  Your teams  You  We have a guest mentor  Comes in  There's a challenge  There's a team challenge  And basically  At the end of the day  We have to evaluate  These spoons  And send somebody home  Not knowing  Who they are  Whether they're on  Our own team  Oh no kidding  So it can lead to  Humiliation and pain  Oh that's  You could send home  One of your own team people  Yeah  And it happens all the time  That's kind of a different angle 
[02:35:30]  Yeah  Yeah there's very few things  You can actually do that with  Where you want  I mean singing  You can recognize the voice  I mean that's one of the only  Things you can do with  What's weird is  We don't know  If there's a heart-rending  Backstory  You know  I'm a cancer survivor  You know  We don't know that  We've already decided  You're going home  You know  I quit my job  You know  It's awful  I feel like  Some sad sack  And you're just  Booting him out the door  I look like  I sent home  You know  Some nice Jewish grandmother  From New Jersey  The other day  And I was like  Oh I'm looking at the show 
[02:36:00]  And I'm like  Oh man  I'm the worst person  In the world  You don't like my  Kugel  And I'm like  Oh jeez  My Kugel  Kugel is terrible  What is  I've had it once  It's awful  At the Brooklyn Diner  It's like eating  Noodle Kugel  Right  And Brooklyn Diner  Has great  Great food  What is Kugel  I don't like Kugel  It's a search engine  For old bros  That want young guys  That was a good one  It's better than a real answer  Fuck it  Yeah I didn't really 
[02:36:30]  Bring anything to the table  With that  I just asked what it was  I kind of want to know  What Kugel is  Because any noodley dish  I usually like  That one I don't like  Are you surprised  With  It's amazing  What interest people  Have in cooking  You know it's a popular thing  But the last ten years  Like chefs show  Anything with a chef  Or with cooking  Is fucking massive  You know look  I'm happy about it  Right  You know my feeling is  The more the better  For years  The chefs and cooks  Were the backstairs  Help  Nobody cared  Nobody ever gave a shit 
[02:37:00]  Like you know  Well the chef  Thinks you should have  I don't care what the chef thinks  Whatever  I'd like a steak  And I'd like a baked potato  So you know  The extent to which chefs  Can now kind of suggest  You or get you to eat  What they themselves think is good  And what they know  They're good at  You know I think it's good  You know  Chefs actually do something  You know they do something  Good for the world  They produce food  So you know to see chefs  Even chefs I don't particularly like  Putting down a nice score  Hey I'm all for it  Working out for me  What does a chef need 
[02:37:30]  To make the jump  Between just being a good chef  And being a good chef  On TV  Because there are a few  On there  And they're compelling  Being a sociopath helps  Yeah  Is that it  Yeah  I mean there's definitely  It's funny because  Most chefs got into the business  Originally because  They sucked at communication  They had serious  Personality disorders  They sensed in themselves  That they were uncomfortable  You know  Doing anything but  Hiding in a kitchen  And you know  Preparing food  Or managing others 
[02:38:00]  Who prepare food  So it's been a steep  Learning curve  For a lot of people  And clearly some people  Are good at it  And some people  They just are not  You know  Have a very hard time  Talking about  Well I think  You had  Like obviously  Julia Child  Early on  Coming up  And she was like  Really the first one  On television  And then  People like  Remember  Who was that Cajun guy  Oh yes  Oh yeah  Yeah yeah  The Cajun  Guy that used to  Chef from Apocalypse 
[02:38:30]  Now  Justin Wilson  Yeah  Chef  Mangos  Yeah  Associate  Justin Wilson  And then all of a sudden  Like you started getting  Like Emeril  Would come out  And he has a little  Catchphrase  Emeril was a  Groundbreaking figure  Because he was the first  Real chef  Right right  With real restaurants  Professional  To become widely loved  And I think  What was also important  About Emeril  Is that he was  So kind of awkward  And you know 
[02:39:00]  Not TV friendly  Initially  That really communicated  To people  That's kind of fun  Do you remember  A gentleman  The Frugal Gourmet  Wasn't he like a rapo  Yes  Was he really  Yes it turned out  No shit  That he  Well here's the story  He was getting sued  By some  Former  Man  Altar  Somebody  He was a minister  Yes  There were allegations  Yes  When he was younger  This guy  When this one guy  Was younger  He said that  The Frugal Gourmet 
[02:39:30]  Was trying to come on  To him  And  I'm not saying  I followed him  On book tour  Every time I go  On book tour  I was asked  The local  The media escort  I said okay  Who's the worst  Most miserable  Uncontrollable  Son of a bitch  You've ever driven around  It's always fun  To find out  He's a real dick  Unanimous  Frugal Gourmet  Really  Horrifying  I mean  Really  Stories of  Alleged projectile vomiting  And you know  Just  Huge  Drinking  Bad behavior  You know  Making out  With his assistant 
[02:40:00]  In the back of the car  In the middle of bible country  I love it  What a creep  I mean  Absolutely  Like fucking dr lector  Yeah  Yeah  Cause he came across  On the show  As a  Caring guy  And then all these  Allegations started coming out  That's great  Well the original show  Was the frugal content  No  That'll never show  You really need to  Soften it a little  Not a good guy  So he wound up dying  Oh he's dead  I think he's dead  Did he go to jail  For some of these allegations  Or  Did he skate  He pled out 
[02:40:30]  Or made a settlement  There was a settlement  Involved  I believe  There was a deal  That went on  Or something  But to the best of my knowledge  He was like a  Huge  Gaping  Steaming asshole  That's why I love  When Bourdain comes in  Who knew  Sounds like it is  What else are you  Going to be doing  For CNN  You're going to do  A little  Not just the show  Right  No no no  You'll be a pundit  No  No one wants to hear  Your views on  I thought you said  You would do a little of that  If there's a food  Related story 
[02:41:00]  Chances are  They're going to  Call me up  You know  Cut a cheese crisis  You know  Yeah  But I mean  I'm not going to be  On election results  No no  But I can see you  Easily sitting in  For peers  Or somebody  Easily  Yeah I could see that  Easily  Yeah you could  No you got that  Kind of personality  You could definitely  Sit down  Sit down  And talk to some  Of these people  Can you be a  Completely pompous  Asshole  Like peers  Whoa that's his  Coworker  Oh sorry  That's his  Coworker  Whoa hey  That's like saying  That's like us  Sitting here and  Saying ah  The broad 
[02:41:30]  Down  The Hulk  Got giant feet  I did a talk show  Format  We did an experiment  Years ago  On no reservations  We did a special episode  It was like a talk show  Format  Where I assembled  You know  Four people  Opinionated people  I sucked  So bad  Really  Really  Wow  As interviewer  Host  It was  I was lucky  To not be  Tard and feathered  I would have led  The posse  Actually  Really  I'm surprised  I was really  Really bad  What did you do  What was harder  About than you thought  All of it  Everything  Everything  Is hard 
[02:42:00]  Really  And I just  I just sucked  And I didn't  See it at the time  Afterwards  It was like  Oh jeez  Oh man  You know the best way  To run a talk show  Is when you want  Someone to talk  You do this  You clap  And you point  At them  That could be  Your thing  That works  You know how quickly  That would get  So annoying  Yeah you throw  Around a topic  So let's talk  About whatever  The topic  The Pope  The Pope's retiring  Oh  That's a point  How would that be  I've achieved  A career mountaintop  In my life  I will be on  Archer  This week 
[02:42:30]  Really  Yes  It's pretty much  It's all  Downhill  I will be playing  The part of  Bastard Chef  You will  The upcoming Archer  Yeah  Do you get to  Say bad words  I get to say  Reasonably bad words  Reasonably bad  Yeah yeah  It is on FX  I was a huge  I was at Comic Con  And you know  I'd done  Aisha Tyler's  Podcast  And I told him  I'm a huge geek fan  And I got in  Somehow gained  Backstage access  At the Archer panel 
[02:43:00]  And I was like  The creepy fanboy  Hanging around  Can you work for me  I'll work for free  Can I write for you guys  Can I do something  I wanted to write  For the show  And I volunteered  To do it for free  And I basically  Hung around  Until  Until they offered  You something  Until they offered  Something  But they wrote  A big part  Oh that's cool  What is Archer  I've never seen  I've heard of it  No way  Never seen  It's on FX  It's an animated series  About a mom  A secret agent  With mom problems 
[02:43:30]  And a lot of poop jokes  Ass jokes  Oh cool  It's filthy  And really really funny  Yeah  I think it's on  Before Legit  What's Legit?  Jim Jeffries  New show  Oh yeah okay  A pal Jim Jeffries  Does Legit on FX  What are you doing?  Yeah  And you're going to be  Speaking at the NRA  Is it the official convention?  The  Yeah  The  Featured speaker  At the 20th  Oh  That's hilarious  It's a little different  Than the National Rifle Association 
[02:44:00]  I see NRA  It's the National  Restaurant Association  Someone asked you about  I'm like that's interesting  It's going to be  It's not quite the same thing  If they want my cannoli  They'll have to fry it  Whatever  Oh my  Oh  That's hilarious  They call it  National Restaurant Association  A little different  Is right  It's basically  What I do  I do about 40 times a year  It's  No I thought you were  Talking about guns somewhere  It's like stand up  Right  Essentially  Yeah  I just played Vegas  Saturday night  First casino gig 
[02:44:30]  You actually did a stand up gig?  Well me and Eric Repair actually  It's funny  Is he funny?  Yes he is actually  Yeah  What do you do?  You guys go on together  Or does one go on first  Then how do you work that?  We go  I interrogate him first  I put him under  An incredibly uncomfortable  I put him in an incredibly  Uncomfortable folding chair  Under a naked spotlight  And brutally interrogate him  Because you know  There's a lot he really can't say  Runs a  You know  A restaurant where he can't talk shit about people  He has to be diplomatic  And measured about things 
[02:45:00]  So his discomfort is very very funny  And then he does the same to me  And it's  It went over  Look  Vegas  That's a  You wouldn't think two chefs up there  Talking would work  But it went over really well  Oh good for you  That's great  Yeah absolutely  What restaurant does he work  I'm so out of that world  I hear he's amazing  It's one of the greatest restaurants in the world  Really?  It's in New York?  Yes it is indeed  Yeah I heard he's very good  Oh my  I've been  What's the best sushi joint in New York again? 
[02:45:30]  I've been  I told Roland to get a hold of your people  Because I've been obsessing  Ever since you said it last time  Not the one at Time Warner  Not Masha  Where it's $2,000 a person  Or some ridiculous thing  Yasuda would be fantastic  Yasuda  That's the one you said  I remember  Yasuda on  On the East 43rd Street  And you want to go for lunch  And you want to sit at the sushi bar  How do you spell that?  Y-A-S-U-D-A  And  Basically you'll need only know one word  Just say omakase  Yeah 
[02:46:00]  And they'll just start feeding you  I hope that's  Fuck your mother  Yeah  Exactly  I'll probably say it wrong  That is urinate in my food  They told me it meant urinate  Did we talk to him about the guy in L.A.?  Yeah  We did last time?  Which guy?  Nozawa  Nozawa  Oh yeah yeah yeah  And he retired  He was looking a little old there though man  He's been making that  Like Tom Skerritt?  Yeah  Just an old man hunched over fish  Hunched over  Really cranky  Yeah  But an amazing experience  In a dumb little strip mall 
[02:46:30]  Yeah just looking at dead animals all day  Staring back up at him  Sounds like heaven to me  Yeah it does  Did you ever go there?  No but I mean I love  You know that super old school  You know basically they throw you out  If you ask for a California roll  Kind of mentality  I like that  Is that what kind of place this is?  No no  They're pretty cool  They're very cool  Is it hard to get in there?  I heard that place in Japan  That's supposed to be the best place  Jiro  What is it called?  Suki and Ashi Jiro  If you've seen the film  Jiro Dreams of Sushi 
[02:47:00]  If you haven't seen it  Please see it  It's amazing  It's a documentary  This guy's like 80 years old  He's been making  More or less the same  35 cuts of sushi  For his entire career  Trying to get better  And better  And better at them  It's  What makes  How do you get better and better?  Yeah that's  Seems like the learning  It's for perfection  The right temperature  The right cut  The you know  Better rice  It is incredibly obsessive  And it's one of the greatest meals  I've ever had in my life 
[02:47:30]  But they don't have  I like to dip it in sauce  Don't be doing that at Jiro  You're pretty much  Yeah  Is it hard to get a reservation now?  I think like 6 months booked?  Very very hard  There's like 12 seats  Why is it so good?  Besides that perfection thing  But after a while  The best  Seafood available  On the market  Coming from people  Who won't even sell their stuff  To most people  Because they don't think  They're smart enough  To understand it  It's cut perfectly  It's served  Each fish is served  At appropriate temperature  And age 
[02:48:00]  Which makes a big  Big difference  And the rice  The rice is  A hugely important component  In the sushi  It's not just about the fish  It's 50% of the story  Is the rice  And this is a guy  Who is an absolute master  And you pick it up  And the rice is almost  Almost warm  And still pillowy  And it is a sublime  Experience that will ruin you  For sushi  With your bare hands  You eat it?  If you're asking the question  What's the difference?  You eat at a place like that  Sushi at that level  And it pretty much  You suddenly understand  It's like you've been 
[02:48:30]  Driving a Yugo  Your whole life  And somebody just gave you  The keys to a Ferrari  And you know  After the first turn  You pretty much understand  What you've been missing  I'm becoming more and more  Of a snob  I used to love sushi  In general  But a lot of these places  Average at best  Yeah  Isn't there a tuna  That is not tuna  But that they  Pass off as tuna?  Look there are  Unscrupulous people  Who will do all sorts  Of terrible things  But you know  If you're eating  All you can eat sushi  You know  $9.99 for all you can eat  You know  I'm a little better than that  Yeah  But I mean  There are  I trust down today 
[02:49:00]  There are  Substitutions  There is right  They gas  Like if it's that  Supernaturally bright  Red  Tuna  Chances are  If it's just eerily  Trans  You know  Psychedelic red  I think they gas that  To  You know  Bring out some color  Yeah  There's a lot of nonsense  In lesser sushi  But  There's a sushi place  Near us  I like it  Their tuna doesn't seem  Like it's actually tuna  Though  All right  Yeah  The color of it  Looks good 
[02:49:30]  If 50% of the people  In the sushi bar  Are Japanese  You're  You're  You're probably  Doing well  If it's  You know  Girls talking loud  And shoving  You know  Rolls  Sushi rolls  Bigger than their head  You know  Into their mouth  You know  And drinking blender  You know  You know  Sake caipirinhas  Sounds  Sounds kind of cool  To go there too though  Yeah  We're so often  Yeah but you're not going  For the sushi  Got some broads  Might pick up a broad or two though  How do you pick up a broad  In a sushi place 
[02:50:00]  I know right  How awful that must be  To try to fuck some  Tell us she smells better  Than the food  Hey  It's a compliment honey  And if it's a good place  You don't really need  The soy sauce  Obviously  Yeah you don't  That's something  You definitely don't want to do  At a really good  At a really good sushi bar  Just drown it  I do  The chef is going to  Great  You know  Trying very hard  To make it perfect  He's brushed a little sauce on  What they really don't want you  To see is  You know  You sit down  Before you've had your first piece  Before the soy sauce  In the bowl  You grab a big  Wad of wasabi 
[02:50:30]  And like mix it up  Into a slurry  Yeah  And then like  Marinate your thing in there  I dip it  Even when they say  No soy  They'll go one  Soy  Soy  No soy  I always take the no soy  And just sneak it in  Like it was an accident  On the way up  I just go  There's a sushi  There's a sushi  Join me and Jimmy  Go every once in a while  He loves it  I hate it  I really don't like Gary's  I love that place  Gary's Sushi  On Columbus Avenue  Near the museum  The Japanese name is Gary  Yeah  Sushi of Gary  That place is awesome  I don't like it  I don't know why  It's a good place  Yeah  But you gotta understand 
[02:51:00]  A little respect  Your sushi chef  At a good place  Has spent seven years  His master  Wouldn't let  Just doing rice  Okay  Between three and seven years  Meaning  I could do that  In a weekend  Wow  His master  Wouldn't let him touch fish  Until he got the rice right  Which took  Somewhere between  Three and seven years  Seven years  That's ridiculous  I'd be like  Look  What else do I have to do  Yeah  This is perfect  You're tearing a hunk  Out of the guy's heart  When you basically 
[02:51:30]  Take a big dump  On his food  As he sees it  You should see  When I put peanut butter  On it  Would that be a good sign  If your sushi guy  Came over and he pulled  Your fish out of his pocket  Seven years  Just dealing with the rice  You see  In Gerard Dreams of Sushi  There's a scene  Of his son  Who's 55  Who's his second  And he's still  Sitting out there  At a little stool  Pan toasting  The seaweed every day  You know  He's not trusted enough  He's not old enough  He's not good enough 
[02:52:00]  According to his father  To like move up  To the first station  I was a Passover  It's serious  That's just a shitty father  Yeah  Come on  You're talking to an artist  Well look  Alright  Fair enough  I'm not that stupid  I'm smart  I am smart  I wish I could do the accent  But I can't  Oh  Yes you can  You just make a wacky  Sanfredo  Fredo  Fredo son  What do you eat  You're eating blueberries  And what  Is that some kind of healthy  Vegetable juice  Vegetable juice 
[02:52:30]  Yes  What kind of  Den of iniquity  I know right  It's beets  And carrots  And ginger  And either cucumber  Or spinach  Yeah  It's called  Making up for 30 years  Of non-condimus  I'm in panic mode now  Did you want to cleanse  No I always eat this stuff  That's his morning ritual  Jimmy lost a lot of weight  He's getting himself together there  What else there Mr. Bourdain  I don't know  I did want to ask one more thing 
[02:53:00]  Parts Unknown  When does it start  April  April okay  I feel like we've been talking about this show forever  So yeah  You're almost there  We started shooting in October  And you know  Each show takes  Between 9 to 12 weeks  To edit  And post-produce  So you know  We're constantly shooting  And at the same time  I'm writing  And post-producing  What we shot already  Headed off to Quebec  In a few days  And then the Congo  Doing the whole  You brought up Apocalypse Now  Doing the whole  Up the river  Wow 
[02:53:30]  Wow really  The Congo  That sounds cool  Man  In Cambodia  No  The Congo  That's Africa  Oh okay  I'm thinking Vietnam  But like the whole  You know  Up a lazy river  I'm thinking the Nung River  A jungle river  Yeah  That's  Wow that's crazy  How many shots  You got to fucking take  Before you go to Africa  I'm up to date  You're all up to date  Oh yeah  You must have had to get a few right  The first time I went out  It was just that  They lined up this row  Of syringes  Oh man 
[02:54:00]  Oh man  Here we go  Do you ever get sick from those shots  Like the flu  Might give you the flu for a while  No  No no no  You just slightly get smallpox  Yeah  You know  You look  Humor on our show  You know  The things we don't want to get  You know  Are the things that no shot will  Ebola  Like what  No  You don't want like  Guinea worm  Guinea worm is like a five foot long worm  Hey  It extorts all the other worms  Hey  No no it gets worse  It lives in an apple  With marble floors 
[02:54:30]  It's indigenous to Staten Island  Two columns outside the hole  Statue of a worm  Urinating on the front lawn  It's five feet long  And it travels around subcutaneously  You can watch it  Under your skin  Move it around  Like a  Wait it comes in  In your foot you said  Yeah  And it travels around subcutaneously  In your body  Causing you all sorts of agony  And uh  How do you get it out  Can't you hit it by punching  I'm sure you peel and punch it all away 
[02:55:00]  In the past  I don't know what they do now  There are treatments  But I think you wait  Until its little head pops out  And you roll it up  On like a toothpick  Oof  Carefully because you don't want  To break the body  Get the fuck  Oh man  Wait wait  How does it go in your foot  Is it burrows  Yeah like  Flat worms  They're all sorts of little  You know  You don't want those  How do you  Hold on though  This is my point  How do you not recognize  A five foot worm  Entering your body  I don't think it's five feet  When it goes in  Alright  It goes in as like an egg  Or a little thing  On a broken part of your skin 
[02:55:30]  You don't want liver fluke  Either  I mean you know  Liver what  It doesn't sound good  I will acknowledge  I just asked one of the  Stupidest questions ever  Thank you  I'm going to acknowledge that  You've got a full grown  Five foot worm  Sneaked into someone's heel  It's just like  Creeping up on you  It goes into your foot  So I will acknowledge that  Oh man  What liver fluke  It sounds like  If his liver was healthy  Something that hatches  That would be a fluke  That hatches little baby flukes  In your liver 
[02:56:00]  Which doesn't sound good  Holy shit  That doesn't sound good at all  Bone break fever  You don't want that  That's pretty much  Essentially you become  Like a stale box of Triscuits  You know  It's like crunch  Your bones get really brittle  What about that dengue fever thing  Dengue is that happy  You haven't had it  But I met a lot of people  Who do something you get  If you live long enough in Africa  That's survivable  Why don't we get this shit here  In America  We've just figured this out  A long time ago  We're amazing  But you need a tropical  And subtropical 
[02:56:30]  Right  You know  Environments  And you need to walk around  You know  Barefoot  Yeah  And feces  And all kinds of fun  Things like that  I think it's bad  Yeah  Bad hygiene  Bad sanitation  Things like that  Bare feet  Not a good  Tropical conditions  Not good medical  But they can't figure out  Shoes yet  Well no  We're getting all this shit  Look  Getting people clean water  And protection against  Malarial or dengue  Mosquitoes  It's just a matter of 
[02:57:00]  Literally  Cost a buck for  Mosquito netting at night  You'd save  Millions of lives  And  You know  It's that simple  And yet that out of reach  For a lot of people  If you're in any country  Where the little kids  Are running around  In  Superbowl champs  San Francisco 49ers shirts  And  There's probably  Some disease  You might be in a bad place  There's probably some disease  And hunger  You might be in a bad place  You might be  If  If the kids is wet  I'm always  You know  I always see as a bad sign  For some reason 
[02:57:30]  I've been in a lot of roadblocks  In the world  Where you know  It's like  Make your own militia  Some kid in like  Camo pants  With a clapped out  Make your own militia  That sounds kind of fun  Clapped out  Clapped out camo pants  An old AK  And like a Tweety Bird shirt  And I'm always  That is frightening  I'm going to die  This is how I'm going to die  It's going to be some guy  With it wearing a Tweety Bird shirt  I'm going to look up  Yeah  That's supposed to be  Just a nice memory  Beep beep  Yeah  Where is  But you pay off those guys easy right  They just want some money 
[02:58:00]  It depends  You know  People are high  At some of these things  You know  I've been  In early 2000s  In Cambodia  The thing you did  Is you'd slow down your car  Throw a whole bunch of  Packs of Marlboros  Out the window  And stomp on the gas  But you know  Sometimes  Some guys just having  A fucking bad hair day  Yeah  And you just happen  To come along  Is Vietnam worth checking out  Vietnam's totally awesome  That's what everyone says  Totally awesome  That would be 
[02:58:30]  Number one on my  Must visit countries  Damn  Why  Great food  Great people  Incredibly beautiful  You know  Pro-American  They like Americans  They like showing Americans  How good their food is  How beautiful  They kick their ass  They're all like  Hey how you doing there  They rattle your hair  A little  Shooka shooka  How you doing kid  Ah nah  Everything's cool now  What city did you go to  I travel around  Saigon  Hanoi  Hoi An is amazing  It's a very diverse country  I mean they have a lot of  It's not all jungle  It's a lot of different areas 
[02:59:00]  There's an area that's very much  Kind of like the Alps  Really  Beautiful country  Have you checked out  Sorry Jimmy  One last question  Have you checked out the tunnels  I didn't go  Yeah  They probably wouldn't fit  Yeah it wouldn't fit  Although I heard they made tunnels bigger  Just so us fat Americans  Could fucking go and check them out  Where the VC used to hide  Yeah  But it was intricate man  It was unbelievable  Little movie  You could watch movies  Really  Yeah  They had it figured out 
[02:59:30]  They were living underground  That was a motherfucker  For our guys  Within an hour of Saigon  You know  Right in the heart of the south  At the heart of enemy territory  You'd get a room for  Like a division  Of VC  Or visiting  NVA  You know  Under  Hidden away  Underground  And it was all just dirt tunnels  Yeah  Huge network  That opened up to big  Like you said  There were hospitals  And all sorts of shit down there  Are you going to go to  I don't know where  Where's Chocolate City in Africa  Isn't Africa where  It's where General Butt Naked is 
[03:00:00]  Oh that's Liberia  I've been there  General Butt Naked  That's right  From Book of Mormon  Yeah but he's a real guy  Yeah I know  He's  I know someone who  Who met him  And one of our old bosses  Actually  Of course  Met him  And had photos with him  And talked to him  I think he's in the  Parliament of Liberia now  He's a preacher  Yeah  He's a preacher  A religious preacher  And the guy I know  Asked him  Something about  Because he would  Sacrifice children  And eat their hearts 
[03:00:30]  And he asked him  Something about  Eating a heart  And he  How do you season it  That is  He would not be  The only guy  To have done that  Called Porro  And that's sort of  Their sort of  Hidden bush religion  And yeah  That was a hardcore show  That was  I got really badly  Poisoned in Liberia  Oh you did  Really  Oh did you go  Near where he was  Yeah  Oh yeah  What got you  Take your pick  Spin the wheel  I think it was  You know  Everybody in the village 
[03:01:00]  Eating out of one bowl  Situation  What were they eating  Bush meat  No  Whatever they had  I love some good bush meat  They're very poor  Honored guests  And they're serving you  What  And they just call it  Bush meat  Whatever they found  Did it smell bad  Oh  More to the point  You know  You know  There's not a lot of  Running water  Where I was  You know  Hygiene is  You know  Catch can  Situation  You got  You know  Ten people  Eating out of one bowl  One of those  Is going to be  The bitch of the bunch  I would hate that 
[03:01:30]  Wouldn't you  Yeah  You violently vomited  Crawling around  On my hands and knees  You know  Praying to every known  Religious figure  Please god  Kill me  Holy shit  An explosive  You know  Both ends  Wow  For how long  Delirium  You know  The whole  Wow man  A couple days  Yeah  A couple of days  So what did you  Just stop the shoot  At that point  And go  I gotta fucking  Just stay here  And do nothing  When you're laying there  On the floor  And you know  Sweating your ass off  Just  You know  It made that first scene  In Apocalypse Now  Good 
[03:02:00]  You know  I was  Just really  Really  You just want to die  You've been there  I don't know if I've ever  Gotten food poisoning  Like that  I've gotten it  But not to that point  That's fucking  International  Liberian food poisoning  Is quite different  That's bad  And it's a situation  Where when you finally  Feel well enough  To like stand up  And maybe  Make it out  The door of your room  You walk out  And it's like  120 degrees  100% humidity  It's like somebody  Punches you in the chest  So right away  You're like down  On your knees again  You know  Crawling to the breakfast 
[03:02:30]  It's terrible  That was difficult  That was a difficult  And then you got to  Shoot and eat again  As soon as you're able  My first scene  Was like a beach party  And surfing scene  I never  I'm like out there  I'm laying on my board  I can't make it past  The first little wave  I would just lay there  And groan  What happened to you  On an American Airlines flight  Have you talked about this already?  Look  It was hardly the worst  You know 
[03:03:00]  Plane story ever  But it was funny  And that  You know  The usual situation  The gate agent  Standing there  Said on time  On time  On time  The plane  Hasn't even arrived  Clearly there's a problem  Finally it arrives  And it's just sitting there  Sitting there  Sitting there  The voice  You know  Someone says  There is a special situation  On the flight  That just arrived  A special maintenance situation  Finally turns out  That somebody  Had apparently  Shot all over their seat  And  That's special  And it took about 
[03:03:30]  An hour or two  For them to figure out  That this is a  A non-cleanable situation  That they had to take  The whole  Remove the seat  The whole plane out of  No they had to take  The whole plane out of service  Wow  And bring in another plane  They took a dump  In their own seat  I hope it was their own seat  Wow  It would be terrible  If it was someone else  It was a coach passenger  They shit in first class  Airborne  Omnidirectional event  Oh wow  They couldn't clean that shit  Apparently not  But apparently it took them  A long time  To figure out  Well  A lot of nooks and crannies 
[03:04:00]  They gotta get rid  Of every bit of that  How do you  It was interesting  The way they were struggling  To describe the event  Yeah  Special maintenance situation  And then finally  Somebody blabs  Some guy shot  A big Cleveland steamer  All over  Wow  What a great thing to do  To take a  You know how great  Your shit's gotta be  To take a plane  Out of service  Yeah your fucking shit  Is as powerful  As a stinger missile  That is fucking awesome  That is awesome 
[03:04:30]  How many flights  Have you taken  In your life  What do you guess  Oh man  You know  I've got well  Over a million miles  A million  Yeah  You know  Each shoot  Is  Thousands  I don't know  I mean  Between the  Between the  Speaking gigs  40 speaking gigs  A year  Other stuff  The hundred  You know  However  16  No reservations  10 layovers  A lot  Internal travel  And some of them  On some very 
[03:05:00]  Shaky  Interesting airlines  We've heard about  From Jonathan  A few of those  Yeah my manager  Flies a lot  Flies a lot  Of those weird  Planes  Where they  You know  They come on  Board with their  Chickens  Yeah  You've seen those  Just flew in  I was just in  Columbia  And we were  Flying out  Into these  Old what used  To be  You know  Traffickers  Strips  In the middle  Of the jungle  And the only  Way to get  In and out  And supplies  To the village  Is these  Old World War  II DC-3s  Which were  Actually amazing  If you're a  Plane nut  You like  Old planes  These things 
[03:05:30]  Are perfectly  Well  Pretty amazingly  Maintained  World War II  Cargo planes  Tail tracker  And they use  Them because  They can land  On dirt strips  And they don't  Need that much  Runway  Because there  Isn't much  Runway  And these guys  Do this all  The time  And you just  You know  There's no seats  You just  Sit on top  Of a couple  Cases of beer  Next to the  Chickens and pigs  How long  Of a flight  Were you on  That for  It's like  Two hours  It depends  Where they're  Going  But an hour  Two hours  And back  It was actually  A lot of fun 
[03:06:00]  People smoking  Hanging out  The hatch  Very loose  Interpretation  That is ballsy  You're crazy  I would never  Do that shit  Never  What was the  Worst flight  Did you ever  Have a really  Scary situation  We've had a lot  Of little  Private planes  Where the  Stall sign  Keeps going  It's white out  Weather  The whole crew  Is in there  Shaking  And suddenly  The little light  Goes stall  Stall  Beep  Beep  Beep  And you  Drop 
[03:06:30]  And then  Engine starts again  And this goes on  For a while  We've had some  Wacky pilots  These Vietnam dudes  Who are now  Running puddle jumpers  In Africa  Or remote areas  Of South America  They haven't seen  Americans for a while  So they want to show you  How this baby handles  This is how we used to  Do it in Nam  Man  It's like  Why are you stalling  That would fucking  Scare me  I was too busy  Clumping my teeth  And what might be 
[03:07:00]  The problem here  You try to ignore  Shit like that  You don't want to be  The guy in the disaster  Movies  What's going on  It's embarrassing  When it lands  It's only good  If you actually crash  For you to get upset  If it lands  You just look like  An idiot  It's like  Oh that was the guy  That lost his fucking  Shit on the plane  Yeah we've been  On some pretty wacky  Planes  Trains  Boats  But I think  Probably the most danger  We've ever been in  On the show  Is just  You know  In vehicles  Drive in Vietnam 
[03:07:30]  Highway 1  Oh my god  Everyone's Asian  Yeah  That's insane  That would be my nightmare  I have a hard enough  Time driving through Queens  Please  So why was that dangerous  On Highway 1  Apparently acceptable practice  There is  You're on a two lane highway  The shoulders  Are completely  Completely filled  With people on bicycles  Motorbikes  You know  Six people on a motorbike  You know  With all of their stuff  Headed to market  There's no room  To pull off the road  Is what I'm saying  You've got two lanes 
[03:08:00]  Of traffic  Going in opposite directions  And then there's  The line in the middle  Acceptable practice  Is to just pull in  In the middle line  You know  Straddle a line  Tear ass down  With no room  To pull in on the side  Because it's bumper to bumper  At high speed  And what you do  Is you just tear ass  Down the highway  At full speed  Banging the horn  Constantly  Problem is  Somebody coming  In the opposite direction  Is doing exactly  The same thing  In a water truck  And they're coming  Straight at you  And just at the point  That you're about  To like  Hit each other 
[03:08:30]  Both cars  Or one  Will just suddenly  Slide into traffic  On the right or the left  And how this is achieved  I don't know  I'll tell you  Because that's my drive  To the Midtown Tunnel  Every day  Across town  But you're 60 miles an hour  Headed straight into  Another vehicle  And you do this  40, 50 times  In the space of two hours  Eventually  At first  It's totally white knuckle  You think  Oh my god  Oh my god  Oh my god  We're all going to die  And then eventually  You just kind of get used to it  Common practice  Beeping there 
[03:09:00]  Doesn't mean  Look out  Look out  It means  I'm here  It's okay  I'm here  It's okay  It's when you stop beeping  There's some kind of  Communication going on  There that I didn't  Really understand  But it was truly  That was terrifying  That's when I really  Thought we're cooked  Wow  Adventures  Yeah  Global adventures  I haven't done shit  Where do you call home?  New York  But you're never here  How many days a year?  A week out of the month  A week out of the month  Yeah  On a good month  And I try to bring 
[03:09:30]  My family with me  You know  If we're shooting  Some place reasonable  Like you know  Western Europe  Or some place fun  You don't bring them  To the Congo  Yeah  Try to take a month  I try  I just started  Trying to take a month  A year  And then  But of course  I travel a lot  You know  My wife's an MMA psycho  And so  Really?  That's right  We  When I'm home  There's a lot of like  Overnights to see  A UFC event  Who's her favorite?  Well I mean  She likes 
[03:10:00]  John Jones of course  Who's riveting to watch  Anderson Silva  She trains at  Henzo Gracie Academy  So any  Gracie associated  Fighter is of course  Going to be  Somebody she's rooting for  You got a wife  That's MMA trained?  She's been  She's a blue belt  With a stripe  Just got her stripe  For Brazilian Jiu Jitsu  And she trains  MMA  And  Wow  You know  Muay Thai  Boxing  She like Vonda Rousey? 
[03:10:30]  Yeah very much  She's amazing  Amazing  Especially because  Rousey's such a great  Wrestler  And judo  But she  Yeah she competes  And  You know  We train  Three hours a day  Six days a week  And  She's not messing around  She'd like to do  Damn  You know  She competes amateur  But I think  Someday she'd like to do  One  Maybe  One  Professional fight  Could she kick your ass  Really?  Oh yeah  Could she really kick your ass?  If she gets inside my reach  I'm cooked  At this point 
[03:11:00]  Look  She gets her hooks in you  It's over  You're done  If it goes to the ground  If it goes to the ground  You're done  I mean she  You would not be the first guy  Who blacks out  Does she fuck with you  Every so often?  Does she fuck with you  And be like  Hey  There's none of that  It's like playing with a gun  Yeah  That's not funny  Wow yeah  At this point  With the Muay Thai  Yeah I'd have a real problem  She was super pissed  Oh man  And you know  It's not like a hobby  It started out  Five years ago  As a hobby  Now it's 
[03:11:30]  She's training  To compete  Wow  Damn  It's an obsession  And  You know  Even injured  I mean she fractured her collarbone  She still went training  You know  Pulled a hamstring  Train  Breaks toes  Goes in  You know  It's  So  Yeah  It is a nice feeling though  You know  And she's  Spoiling for a fight  She's looking  She's looking  To take someone out  At a social situation  So you should do  What they do  Mouth off to someone  In the movie theater 
[03:12:00]  Watch her handle it  I've explained  That she's from Italy  And I've explained  To her that liability  Law is here  And you know  We're very litigious here  You can't just beat  Somebody up  Because they talk bad to you  So I'm waiting  For the appropriate moment  Where some guy  Like some guy  In a bar  Is  You know  Puts his hand on me  And you know  She's coming back  From the ladies room  Get out  He's really not  Going to want to  Tell his friends  About what happens next  Wow  You know  Anthony Bourdain  Yeah  His wife choked me out  Yeah  And broke my arm

[03:19:30]  Here's your host  Sam Roberts  Alright, that was a good  Dry run through  So let's try it for real  This time  You got it  Do it, do it  Go for it  Alright  No dead air  They hate it  Alright  Can I do it with  If  Ah, fuck this  You gotta do it right now  Alright  Sirius XM  The Opie and Anthony channel  It's after Opie and Anthony Live  Here's your host  Sam Roberts  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do 
[03:20:00]  Hey, everybody  It's after Opie and Anthony Live  What happened in there?  As soon as I went to do it  The screen just turns white  And then nothing works  Everything just crashed?  Alright, wait a minute  We may gotta  Alright, I got it back  But  But what?  Yeah, it's back  I don't have your production up  But I  What do you mean you don't have my production up?  Because I was trying to switch it over from ONA  And that's when it fucked up  Oh  Why would you switch it over from ONA  As soon as the show started? 
[03:20:30]  Why wouldn't you do it like during the break?  Because I leave it up during the live reads  Plus doing the double  Just so it doesn't fuck up  And then this is what happened  During the last break  And then it fucks up  And then it fucked up  So you should do it like  A couple minutes before I come on the air  Instead of five seconds  No, no, no  I wait till the last break  Because I gotta play something in the double  Okay  Separate the breaks  So that the computer doesn't fuck up  So when did it crash?  It crashed about  About a minute before you came on  Oh, okay  So you're sitting there  Trying to figure out 
[03:21:00]  How to get it back  Yeah, the screen goes white  Like it's loading  And then it just sits there  And I can't access anything  Did you get scared  Because you didn't want Papa Sam  To get mad at you?  No, I just don't like dead air  And it sounds like shit  When you do it that way  Of course  John in Virginia  I would like to introduce you  Sam Roberts  I need to  Because the vibe in here  Is just not  It's not what it should be  You know what I mean?  I'm not in  I'm not in the mental space  That I need to be in  Because I haven't heard an intro  I haven't heard anything  That gets me excited  Okay, you ready?  Yeah  Okay 
[03:21:30]  Ladies and gentlemen  The ONA after show  Starring the greatest broadcaster  In broadcasting history  The great  Prime time  Sam Roberts  All right  Yeah  Woo  Now I feel good  How come you couldn't have  Give me something like that  Iraq?  I was panicking  That's an intro  Yeah  It's after Opie and Anthony live  Taking your calls  866-WOW1-WOW  866-969-1969 
[03:22:00]  Hell of a show today  On Opie and Anthony, huh?  Yeah, that's the way to start  That was great  I'll fix it in post  Yeah, make it sound real smooth  For the on-demand listeners  It's important  They need to know  That this is a smooth show  Roger in Georgia  Roger  Oh  He got scared  Well  I guess a little professionalism  Gets added into the show  And callers get scared off  It happens  It's after Opie and Anthony live 
[03:22:30]  We didn't get to do a  Line of the day  Yeah, I'm loading that right now  On the ONA show today  So I guess  We'll be prepared for that  Anthony Bourdain was in for an hour  How great was that?  It was so awesome  Every appearance  Is a home run with him  Well, because he's just  An interesting guy  Like he is  If there was  A real world's most interesting man  Anthony Bourdain would be in  Huge contention for it  He does  There's nobody who's as well traveled  And who's experienced as much 
[03:23:00]  And is able to explain the stories  As well as he does  You know, you have people  Who go out  And they do these crazy things  Right?  And they go and travel  To all these strange  Far away lands  But then they come back  And nobody wants to hear  What they did  Because they're boring people  Or because  Like they just can't  Communicate properly  But Anthony Bourdain  Knows how to tell a story  And then at the same time  Does everything it takes 
[03:23:30]  To make a story interesting  To me, I couldn't help  But think  Like looking at him  He is an ideal person  To interview  But a terrifying person  To have a conversation with  Like there's no way  Because if you start  The conversation  You're going to start  With some bullshit  That there's nothing  In your life  That could possibly  Be interesting to this dude  And when he comes at you  With the stuff  That he's filling his day with  What are you going  To respond with?  What are you going  To respond with  That's going to impress him?  After he is telling 
[03:24:00]  The stories about  Oh yeah, you know  Like what's your worst flight?  Oh yeah, one time  There was turbulence  On the flight  And I got really scared  I actually had to use  A vomit bag  Almost got sick on myself  Anthony Bourdain  Oh yeah, I mean  Regularly we get on  These little puddle jumpers  And the big stall light  Comes up  And the engine  Goes out in midair  What?  I can't communicate  With you on that level  He starts talking  He's explaining sushi  Sushi, he's explaining everything 
[03:24:30]  You don't eat sushi, do you?  Eat sushi?  I barely eat fish  Do I eat sushi?  You eat fish sticks  I don't eat rice or fish  So I don't know  How I would do with sushi  Bring your mic down  A tiny bit  You're clipping  I'm clipping  There you go  Everything is just  I want you to sound perfect  Thank you  It's about time  Somebody took care of me  Like you do  No, I don't  I stay very far away  From sushi  Why?  Do you eat sushi?  I've never  I've tried different things  I've never really got into it  Like I know everybody loves it  Eric goes to sushi bars 
[03:25:00]  And is like  Could we put some batter on this?  Should we get some  Yeah, some kind of  Maybe like some kind of  What I like to do  Is throw it in potato chip crumbs  Can we deep fry it with something?  Someone tell these people  It's not cooked  Yeah, let's bake it in cornflakes  Or something  Make it crispy  Shake and bake  No, well you're not  A classy guy though, Eric  You like comfort foods  That's not true  You don't like comfort  I like seafood  And other things  I just don't care for  I've tried different sushi  And I just  I always try it 
[03:25:30]  I just never like it  You like classy food?  I like sushi  No, I don't  You just said you didn't  I just realized what I said  You were lying  I think you would just prefer  Comfort food  No, my wife loves sushi  And every time we go out  I try different things  But I just  I haven't found anything really  That I've liked  With my sushi experience  You gotta show your wife  Who's boss  Every time we go out  And she's like  Oh, would you like to try some?  You go, fuck no pizza  Absolutely not  What's breaded  And white meat on the menu? 
[03:26:00]  I'll order that  Well, wait a minute  I saw you  You tweeted a photo  Of you eating some upscale food  What?  Some, what was it?  Cheese and crackers  Oh, yes, that's right  Well, you gotta load up  In your suit and tie  When you're at like places  Where you have to wear a tie  Generally, when I'm getting dressed  If I'm wearing a tie  It means I'm not gonna have  A very large dinner  I might be able to find  An appetizer or two  That I enjoy  But the main course  Is not gonna be to my liking  So, and that's  Most of the time  That I wear a tie  And I know that going in 
[03:26:30]  So I'll have a big lunch  And I'll have a late lunch  You know what I mean?  To make sure  That I'm not starving  And then once we get there  I'll load up on cheese and crackers  And just fill the old belly  With that stuff  But don't they have other foods there?  Yeah, they have other foods available  Not to my liking, though  You know I'm a particular man  When it comes to food  You don't like a  Like a vegetable platter?  I don't know  Like broccoli or carrot sticks?  I'll eat some carrot sticks  But I mean, this is  When you wear a tie 
[03:27:00]  A lot of times  There is not a vegetable platter  There is not crudita  Or crudité  Or however those Frenchies say it  Crab cakes?  Exactly  They give you crab cakes  They give you bread  With some kind of weird spread  All over it  Some kind of mushroom puff?  Yeah, exactly  That's what they're serving  And I'm not getting anywhere  Near that stuff  And by the way  Having Anthony Bourdain in here  Does not make me think to myself  Man, that's something  I gotta start trying new things  Like you're missing out 
[03:27:30]  Right  I gotta be more of a man  Like this guy  Because Anthony Bourdain  Anthony Bourdain is such a manly man  That he can be married to an MMA fighter  And not look like a pussy  Like if our wives  Could kick our asses  People would be like  Yeah, we knew you were pussies  From the beginning  But Anthony Bourdain still  He said it  His wife could kill him  With her bare hands  And he doesn't look like a pussy  But  I don't want to try anything  When I see him  Or hear his stories 
[03:28:00]  Because  He's talking about  Almost dying in planes  He's talking about  Making sure that parasites  Don't enter his body  What was that story  He was talking about  That they were hanging out  The hatch  Yeah, they were on like  A weird plane  That was right after  He was talking about  All the shots that he has to get  Yeah  To make sure that he doesn't  Get parasites  He was talking about  A five foot worm  Living under your skin  That's terrifying  I understand  That eating steak  Does not  Automatically lead 
[03:28:30]  To getting parasites  From a third world country  All I'm saying is  It's a slippery slope  And it's not one  That I want to go down  Only if it's not cooked  And been sitting out for days  But who  What if I'm going  And I'm like  Okay, I'll try some  Normal people food today  I'll try to  Oh, we're going to go for  Indian food today  I'm going to try some of that  Because this is the new  Sam Roberts  Where I try things  And then it just keeps going  And going  And you're just trying things  And all of a sudden  You have parasites  And your plane is crashing  And you're in danger 
[03:29:00]  It's not anything I want in my life  Okay  I've figured out  That if you eat chicken  And you cook it  You can just cut it open  If it's white  Then you eat it  If it's pink  Then you don't eat it  And I can have that every day  And it's delicious  And I can maintain my lifestyle  Without that danger element  I don't have  I don't need the unpredictability  That he does  Anthony Bourdain does  I get the appeal  I just don't need it 
[03:29:30]  You keep trying all these things  You get sick  And then all you can do  Is blame everyone around you  For making you try things  That's exactly what I would do too  Because it would be their fault  It would be your fault, Eric  It would be my wife's fault  It would be everybody's fault  For telling me how to live my life  I don't like stuff  There's a few things that I like  And that's what I like  Hey, Sam  What's up, Bill?  Professional broadcaster  Sam Roberts  That's exactly right  All right  I got something  You can actually eat  At a Japanese restaurant 
[03:30:00]  And I think you might even like it  What is it?  Chicken katsu  K-A-T-S-U  It's a chicken cutlet  Deep fried  And panko flour  And then it's served with  What's called tonka sauce  Which is sort of  A Japanese-style ketchup  Now when you say served with  Do you mean that this sauce  Is over the chicken  Or is it on the side?  Most places put it on the side  As long as you keep it on the side  I'll try some  Just ask for it on the side  I will 
[03:30:30]  Well, what if they're Japanese  They don't know what I'm saying  What's the Japanese word  For on the side?  Most places will understand  All right  Kevin in Houston  Hey Sam, how's it going, buddy?  How are you doing?  Hey brother  I sell food for a living  You do  And salmonella poisoning  Is way more common in chicken  Than any type of parasite  That you might get from beef  Yeah, but if you cook it right  Like if it's cooked and burnt  You're not going to get any salmonella, right? 
[03:31:00]  Well, yeah, that's true  Yeah  Eating the same protein consistently  You're going to screw up your body  You're going to end up with gout  Which is extremely painful  Chicken is not the only place  That I get protein from  Monday, Wednesday, Friday  It's chicken  Tuesday, Thursday  It's cum  So I get protein from all  Mark that, please  Thanks  That's good  I'm glad you're being a good boy  But I would just suggest  Oh yeah, Kevin  Oh yeah  Your horizon  On when it comes to protein 
[03:31:30]  Because too much chicken  Too much beef  Too much of anything  It's not good  I'm going to get diverticulitis  Like Brock Lesnar  It would be awesome  That's what I would do  You're going to get that thing  Tattooed on your chest?  Yeah, and then I get a penis sword  Tattooed across the top of my chest  Except I'll be all like  My skinny fat torso  Not nearly as intimidating  As Brock Lesnar's MMA torso  My rib cage and titties  Cody in Houston  Hey Sam, what's up? 
[03:32:00]  What's up, buddy?  I got a suggestion for E-Rock  For some sushi you might like  Okay, well first of all  If you're suggesting it to E-Rock  It should probably be whatever comes  In the largest quantities  Well, it's pretty big  It's a big roll  Comes in a bucket  Yeah, exactly  Here's something you might like  It's got mayonnaise on it  Oh  It's called a shaggy dog  It's basically rice  With fried shrimp inside of it  And it's got this spicy mayonnaise  All over it  I think it's like E-Rock 
[03:32:30]  Doesn't that defeat the point of sushi?  No, it's a shrimp tempura roll  Yeah, does that sound like  Legit sushi to you, Roland?  Wherever he's eating that  It's called the shaggy dog  I wouldn't go there again  Where he said  Wherever he's eating it  It calls it the shaggy dog  Is not maybe the place  Where you want to have your dinner  Yeah, it's supposed to be  Like the shrimp tempura roll  But sushi  Sushi's not supposed to have  Fried food in it  Yeah, it does  It does  It's not sashimi  You uncultured swine  What do you think?  Sushi is just raw fish?  Yeah, they also have  Spicy salmon cruncher roll 
[03:33:00]  Typical American  Right, Roland?  Yeah  Really?  Bad palate  Yeah  Roland was texting me the other day  Because I was trying to find  Some barbecue where I was at  And he was literally  He was texting  And tweeting  And panicking  Because I said  I was going to go  Just eat a Dallas barbecue  Because it was right where I was  Isn't that a  Is that a chain?  I just vomited in my mouth  You did  Just for mentioning it  It wasn't bad  It wasn't good  Well they closed our barbecue place  Down there  Yeah, I know 
[03:33:30]  Where Gotham is  Yeah  If there's like  Shit barbecue  They also put it right there  They closed  Rub  Yeah, I think because of like  Rent issues  No, what happened was  I heard about this  It was  First it was rent issues  You gotta  Roland and me  Used to  And I think Eric won a couple times too  We went with Troy a couple times  We brought a couple ladies from up here  A time or two  That was the spot  It was my favorite barbecue spot  I used to go there without you  And that  Yeah  Yeah  And that was the one thing  You actually ate  The one thing 
[03:34:00]  The one type of restaurant where I can hang  Is a barbecue place  Like when I go to a barbecue place  It's a totally foreign concept to me  Because  I actually have to pick between things on the menu  Most restaurants I go  And there is one dish that I will have  And it makes it very easy  I'm sitting there at like barbecue places  Looking at this menu  Like  I gotta sit here and make a choice now  There's multiple dishes that I'll eat  So we went to this place called Rub  And it's here in the city  And  Is the best  Barbecue  Wings are amazing 
[03:34:30]  Around  Memphis style barbecue  Memphis style  The wings are great  Everything was awesome  So what happened to this place was  First the rent started going up  And they were like  Okay  Sandy came  And blew out the whole front of the restaurant  It smashed it  They were like  Fuck  So they spent all this money  And they fixed it  After Sandy  And then a car drove into the restaurant  What?  After they fixed  After they fixed the whole place  Like they spent all the money they had  Fixing it because of Sandy  A random car just drives into the front of the restaurant 
[03:35:00]  And smashes it  And they had to close  Holy shit  It was crazy  That's cursed  And so now  You gotta go to Dallas Barbecue  You should go to the Mighty Quinn's  It's just  I told you  Hop a cab  Where is it?  On 2nd Avenue  Right  Yeah right  That's the other thing with Roland  It doesn't matter  Just hop a cab  Like to Roland  Because we were going to see  This is when Bob Kelly was playing at Gotham  Go late  And we were going  To see it  So we were like  We need someplace nearby  Rub is closed 
[03:35:30]  Oh let's go to Dallas Barbecue  And I started texting Roland  Being like  Hey you know  There's no place I'm missing right  I think this is where we're gonna eat  Roland starts panicking  Hill Country  And in Roland's mind  It's food before everything else  Yes  So he starts texting me  All these places  Like one of them  Wasn't even in Manhattan  Brooklyn  I'm like no  I wanna eat  And then go to the club  He's like  No no no  You gotta go to Brooklyn  You gotta go to this place  And then he started  That's when he started tweeting  Panicking  Yes  Cody in DC 
[03:36:00]  Alright  Sam  Do you eat bacon?  Y'all I love bacon  Okay  I was gonna say  If you just eat chicken  And don't eat bacon  I got a problem with that  Dude you can't  I will have bacon with anything  Alright  Now as far as barbecue goes  Yeah  There's a place in the city  There's also one up in Syracuse  One in Rochester  Called Dinosaur Barbecue  Of course Dinosaur Barbecue  But that's in Harlem  So it's worth it  I mean  It's worth it  But I'm sitting there being like  Okay  I'm gonna go see Bob Kelly 
[03:36:30]  At Gotham in an hour  I'm just trying to get something  To eat right now  You should go to the Mighty Quins  It's not a whole trip  Thank you Cody  Yeah Dinosaur Barbecue  You gotta go to the original  In Syracuse now  Yeah  You've never been to the one  In Syracuse  No I've just been to the one  In Harlem  Yeah it's delicious  I went to the one in Syracuse  You did?  When?  I had to drive up to Rochester  For a wedding  When was that?  Maybe  Probably pushing two years now  Well when did you have invited me?  I used to go to Syracuse  You could have had a great time  Because I sent you a photo  Saying I'm at Dinosaur Barbecue 
[03:37:00]  In Syracuse  Oh that's right  And I saw  I think I saw one of your stickers  In the bathroom  I think there's a Not Sam sticker  In there  Yeah  They opened a new one  In Newark  Right next to the Prudential Center  It's awesome  Oh really?  Yeah  Hmm  Rob  Rob in New York  Hey how are ya?  I got a place  It's a tiny little hole in the wall  On Orchard Street  It's called Georgia Southern BBQ  It's amazing  Anthony just tweeted in 
[03:37:30]  He said Dallas BBQ  Dallas was Tom Skerrits  Any name  I guess name  An alien  Tom Skerrits  Who's that?  Tom Skerrits  Tom Skerrits  E-Rock do you know Tom Skerrits?  I've heard of him  Tom Skerrits  Ticket fences?  That's right  Oh  Tom Skerrits  Ronnie in Baltimore  Ant's texting me about Tom Skerrits now  It's dangerous driving right now  Yeah it is  Because Ant's sliding across the LIE 
[03:38:00]  Texting about Tom Skerrits  You know what would be great  Is if Ant got in  And you know  I love Ant very much  With all my heart  But if Ant got into a fatal car accident  Right now  And he ended up on one of those  Do not text and drive commercials  And it said  Like it came up  His last text was  Dallas  That was Tom Skerrits name  An alien  And then that line  That goes to the end  Yeah  And I'd just be sitting there like  He taught me everything  I know about broadcasting  And Tom Skerrits 
[03:38:30]  And now he's gone  Because of you  Tom Skerrits  What's up Ronnie?  Hey  I was gonna say  Yeah Tom Skerrits  Dude in aliens man  Alien one  But  Yeah  You ever notice how quick  He looked like he was getting older?  Yeah  I thought he was dead  He's like  He should be  But anyway  Hey I was gonna say  Sushi and pork  Are the two most dangerous meats  You can eat  Dude you are fine with chicken  Chicken and bacon  Wrap that chicken up in bacon  Your pork is delicious 
[03:39:00]  Sushi is loaded  With parasitic worms  Hookworms  And all sorts of microscopic things  That like literally  Some of it gets into your brain man  That's terrifying  Roland is that what happened to you  Is that why you can't speak as well  As some other people?  Is it parasites in your brain?  No it's cheap  You think he just doesn't like to spend money on food  Ding ding  He prefers to go to a McDonald's  Or Wendy's  It's like honey  No I'm saving your life  Forget that $50 menu  Yeah  Applebee's is right around the corner  Ugh  Why go to sushi 
[03:39:30]  Go ahead  Hey I'll do this real quick  Cook the damn fish  It takes a minute to cook fish  You know  Then you go to a fish house  Go to a fish house right?  He's sitting there going like  Baby baby baby  I don't want you to get parasites  Yeah  Let's eat good in the neighborhood tonight  Okay?  I heard Chili's have a two  Two meals for $20 special  What day of the week is it baby?  It's Friday  Then guess where we're going?  Friday  And she's like with her friends  Tom said I can't die with parasites  You don't have any time for people 
[03:40:00]  Who want to spend their nights  At Arabies and Fridays  Fuck them  I get the finger when I walk by those places  You're trying to experience the world  You're in the Anthony Bourdain camp  Yes  Parasites be damned  You're going to experience all the flavors  That this earth has to offer you  Yeah like Sunday Troy and I  We tried this new Cuban place  It's so tiny  You're like elbow to elbow  With the person next to you  I'm glad you brought up Sunday  I follow you and Troy on Instagram  You guys know that don't you?  Of course  You're great Instagrammers  Both of you  Roland because he doesn't Instagram for a while 
[03:40:30]  And then he decides to Instagram  150,000 pictures at once  Crank the window  And Troy he gives us a taste  Of the Lower East Side  A lot of graffiti  A lot of graffiti  But he gives us a taste of city living  Now for a long time  Troy was in here  And he was saying  How he wanted you to lose weight  How you have to get your body together  You got to exercise  Giving you tips on picking up women  Getting healthy  Everything  Yeah  Like he was your life coach  Once a life coach gives up 
[03:41:00]  I said come to the dark side  And I'll show you the good food  Because he has become  The biggest enabler in Roland's life  He became a foodie partner  Troy  I took him  And one day  We went to Tacombi  What's Tacombi?  The taco place  Okay it's a taco place  We ate  And then Troy goes  I want something else  I go  I know a great dessert spot  And we went to there  And we shared  Banana Fosters  Like  We shared it  We shared it  You shared it  And then what  After the banana  No they thought we were gay  Well I would assume so  Yeah  It didn't matter 
[03:41:30]  Before you even ordered  It was beyond delicious  Yeah  It's like the best banana Fosters  And then you had banana Fosters  That was the end of your night  No  Oh  And then Troy goes  Well we split it  Should we order another one  And I go  Wait  Where are we at?  And I go  There's another great spot  I know  That's not too far  Not too far from where you were  It was raining  Cold  And we walked  A little bit  Soaked  Okay so it's raining  It's cold  You just had a banana Fosters  And tacos  And tacos  You decide you're still hungry  When was this?  Last week? 
[03:42:00]  Yeah  You decide you're still hungry  So you walk in the pouring rain  To Columbus Street Bakery  It's like God's beacon  Columbus Street Bakery  Columbus Street Bakery  Okay and so what did you get there?  Chicken and waffles  You just had tacos and ice cream  And banana Fosters  I know we were going to get the dessert  But we saw the chicken and waffles  We got to go for it  We split it though  You had four meals  Well  It was  Two meals  And a dessert  Yeah  And we split it  It was fucking delicious  I understand it was delicious 
[03:42:30]  But do you not think that you're  You're a bit of an enabler now Troy?  You've kind of  Gone to the complete opposite end  Of where you were coming from before?  I don't think so  That was  Well that was last week  Yeah  And then I saw this week  Oh we went big yesterday  You guys were tweeting photos  We did Cuban food  I heard  It was so  Cat fucking good  The sandwich was  Beyond exquisite  But you guys are  Tweeting photos  Let me see if I can find the photo  You're tweeting these photos  It's on my Rolandos99  Is that your Instagram?  Yeah  It's on Troy Kwan too 
[03:43:00]  And Troy Kwan  You got to see these photos everybody  Because they're  Giant plates of food  And there's a lot of them  Yeah  And we didn't even take a picture  Of the corn too  Oh yeah  Well why would you have time  For vegetables like that?  There's  Plates of bacon  No bacon  What were some of the dishes you had?  We had the  The Cuban sandwich  I had with rice  What's a Cuban sandwich?  It's a ham  Roasted pork  Cheese  And the sauce  It was beyond delicious  And then I had the rice and beans  Troy opted for the fries 
[03:43:30]  You went for the fries instead  And then  Troy's girlfriend had  The chorizo con papa tacos  Whoa whoa whoa  Those are not English words  It's like a spicy sausage  And potatoes  Tacos  It's just amazing  Okay I'm looking at this right now  First of all  First of all chorizo  So I ordered another place  So we could share  You're telling me that's not bacon  That comes with the Cuban sandwich?  No no no  That's ham  That's ham  That's fried ham  Yeah  Yeah  Okay so not  It's grilled  It's grilled  It's grilled ham 
[03:44:00]  I'm sorry  Yeah healthy right Roland?  Yes  I'm seeing multiple Cuban sandwiches  Correct  Grilled ham  Yes  Beans with rice  Yes  Heavy dressing salad  No it's a light  It's like a cheese sour cream  That goes over the chorizo con papa  That's not light  It's fucking delicious  I'm not saying it's not delicious  And then tacos or something  Is that the chorizo papa deal  That you were just talking about?  It's phenomenal  Ridiculous  And then we had a hot chocolate 
[03:44:30]  Then I had a  A hot chocolate was the beverage to go with it  That's what Troy had  Mexican hot chocolate  What's the Mexican hot chocolate?  It's a little spicy  It has tequila in it  A little alcohol?  No  He doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about  No I had two huge  Cafe Cubano coffees  It was fucking amazing  Okay and then  I look further  Oh yes  And  I just see a picture  You're in Troy's apartment  After dinner  Why do you help?  I  And I see the fire alarms going off  And I go  Oh what kind of hygiene 
[03:45:00]  Are they up to now?  And the caption says  While cooking the apple pie  Yes  The fire alarm went off  And ice cream  And ice cream  A la mode  But  Roland did go grocery shopping with me  He looked at me as if to say  What are you making a big deal about this?  A la mode  Yeah  What do you expect?  We're trying to be human beings  A la mode  Well I can't speak for Roland  But I did  About an hour and a half workout  Before we went for brunch yesterday  Okay  That's what I'm talking about  And that's what makes you an enabler 
[03:45:30]  You sit there eating food  Knowing  That you're just gonna  Down energy drinks  And  Exercise for hours on hours  Well listen  Roland  Roland's not gonna do that  You know he's not gonna do that  Roland  Roland is the boss of Roland  Roland has an exquisite taste in food  Yes  I'm not saying he doesn't  Okay that's where Roland's a Viking  He knows good food  So he texted me  He's like  Hey what are you doing?  I was like  Nothing  He's like  Let's go get brunch  I'm like  Sounds great 
[03:46:00]  That was after this?  No that was  That was earlier  That day  So we were like  Okay we'll get brunch  You got brunch as well  What'd you get for brunch?  No that's the Cuban  The Cuban  This is brunch?  Yeah  This is bigger than most people's dinners  That's for three people  Yeah when I roll in  I tell Troy  When I roll in  I don't give a fuck  Here's what I want to taste  Right  Boom  The woman goes  What else?  I go this is this  I don't give a fuck  You don't give a fuck  No  I'll pay  I just want to taste it  Right  It's delicious  You don't think that Troy's a bit of an enabler?  No  Roland's the boss of Roland 
[03:46:30]  Roland knows what he's doing  Yeah but you're not going to bring an alcoholic to a bar  Well  And listen  Why not?  Well you would  But I mean  I've given up on trying to help Roland with things  If he wants my help he knows I'm here for him  But you know  But you've given up so far on helping Roland  That you've gone to the other end  And you're enabling him  Nah  Okay but if Roland texts me and says  Hey do you want to get brunch?  I'm hungry  And I think to myself  Well I'm hungry too  Why should I deny myself brunch with Roland?  Well wouldn't you  Don't you think he could be like  Oh why don't we go to this place? 
[03:47:00]  Maybe like a health food place  I'm not his mother  Or like  Oh Roland  Maybe you should kind of calm down on ordering this many items on the menu  I'm not his mother  Yeah I know  I share with everybody  I go  I order extra two plates  Let's all share  Yeah in his defense  He got all those tacos  And he had one  We had one  Or  Yeah there's a lot more than tacos on that picture  Or  Maybe not  Okay now let's go back to my place  And have an apple pie and ice cream  A la mode  Well then like  His girlfriend goes  Well what should I do with the crust?  I go  Well the crust has no flavor 
[03:47:30]  Let's make it flavorful  Butter  Sugar  And cinnamon  Boom  And made it delicious  He did  In his defense  He did make it more delicious  It does sound delicious  And we hung out  It was fun  Have you and your  Did you and your girlfriend work out  To get rid of the calories?  Oh yeah  I put in  I usually work out an hour and a half every day  How about your girlfriend?  She puts in about an hour every day  That's still  I mean way more than  For instance me  Most people  I walked to the subway  I sat down on the couch  And passed out like a baby  You see what I'm saying Troy? 
[03:48:00]  But Roland did go grocery shopping with me yesterday  And what was mostly everything I bought?  It was all  Fruits  And all vegetables  Everything you bought?  Everything I bought  Well I'm not  I'm not  I'm setting the exact  I'm setting a good example to him  Like look at all these vegetables I'm buying  Yeah but you know how Roland's mind works  Those  One cheat day  Becomes a cheat weekend  Becomes Fridays  Becomes Thirsty Thursdays  Then all of a sudden  It's more nights of the Cuban  And less nights with his delicious vegetables  I took a girl out on Saturday  And went to this awesome Greek place  It was delicious 
[03:48:30]  Took a girl out  Yeah  That's what I'm talking about  So like a Greek restaurant  The guy goes  Oh I suggest this  I go  What do you suggest?  He goes these four things  I go bring them out  He said I suggest this  And you responded to that comment  By saying what do you suggest?  I would have responded  Why wouldn't you listen  The first time I said it?  No he goes like  We have these four small  I go bring them all out  He goes really?  Do it  Just bring them out  Money is not a thing  It's food right?  I just want to try it  Right  And then the other  She's a foodie too  So she goes  Oh you're a foodie  Yeah  She goes so am I  So I'm like boom  No guilt on your end 
[03:49:00]  No  Look I  Not you Roland  I know damn well  There's no guilt on your end  Yeah  It's delicious  Like Taste America  Like Bourdain  We were talking  Did you go here?  Yeah  Would you order?  I go this  That's what I do  Yeah I think Bourdain also  Does a lot of working out  And has a nutritionist  And a stylist  And he's got people around him  Making sure  That he doesn't eat unhealthily  I have Rob Cross  My nutritionist  We go to the food trucks  For lunch  I've told Roland  I said look  I've tried to give him  Advice on different things 
[03:49:30]  Yeah  That I have a little bit of  A little knowledge in  And he completely ignores it  And just  It's just  It goes in one ear  Not the other  That's something  I mean we learned that  We documented the whole process  On this show  Yeah  And I was trying to help him too  And we were trying to get  His life together  And it was  It was pay no mind  To Sam and Troy  Correct?  Correct  Correct  And unfortunately  It's going to take something  Where Roland's going to have to be sick  Or something's going to have to happen  For him to snap out of it  So you're sitting there going  Well  If I can't beat him 
[03:50:00]  I'll join him  It would be  Delicious Food Journey  Is that what you're thinking?  I mean he knows good food  If I want to go eat a good lunch  So in your head  You're thinking  You know what  Un-fucking-believable  Alright  I'm sure it tasted good  That's not the debate  We had to walk  Like an adventure  For this place  It's amazing  It's an adventure  In the rain  We were soaked  It's a delicious food adventure  I believe that's how you described it  Yes  It's kind of like  The place was  Is down in the alley  You have to go to  And the restaurant's  Right in the alleyway  You have to go around 
[03:50:30]  And try to find it  You're talking about  Having like a brunch day  Where it's like  We go to  Different spot  Different spot  Different spot  And try a little bit of everything  Right  But that you could probably  Handle that  In the sense that  You would have  I don't know  Actually you'd probably  Have big portions  But you'd work out  Like crazy  Like an anorexic woman  The next day  Yeah  Because I mean  I've watched you  I've gone out to eat with you  And me and my wife  You and your girlfriend  And you're sitting there  Going like  Oh I don't know  Maybe we should split this  And you're calorie counting  And you're you know 
[03:51:00]  Let's each have half the burger  And blah blah blah  So you know what you're doing  Sure  And when you go  Like when you eat  Irresponsibly as you would say  You know that later on  Your body will pay for it  And you gotta make up for it  And you do that  Yeah and then you gotta watch  The next couple days  But you know Roland doesn't  No I know that  But look  He's a 32 year old  33 year old man  I mean  He can do as he pleases  What am I supposed to do  Italy  You had one of the best sandwiches  You went to Italy  When?  Eataly  Oh 
[03:51:30]  Eataly  What's eataly?  It's um  Mario Batali  It's on the  I think like 23rd street  When did you do that?  I did that on  I took her on Saturday  That was our first stop  You got a sandwich  And Greek food?  That was early in the day  And that was at night time  How long was this date?  All day  Let me ask you something  Yeah  Any finger smelling  At the end of this date?  Mmm  Just from the Greek food  Just hot sauce huh?  Just the Greek food  That's alright  Yeah  Um  But it's an 
[03:52:00]  It's an amazing place  I'm sure that all these places  Have delicious food  Beyond  I'm trying to help  Roland wants to get a bike  For the spring  Yeah  I'm excited  I'm going to steer him  In the right direction for that  We're going to ride to  And I said  Yeah  You're not steering him  In the right direction  No and I said  If you get a bike  We'll go on bike rides  I'll get him motivated  Once it's warm out  He needs a little jump start  That's what it is  He needs to see  And he needs to get back  To where he was at before  Because he was in a good spot  But do you think  You think right now 
[03:52:30]  You're helping him  Get back to that spot  Well maybe I'm just helping him  Push him to the point  Where he realizes  That there's a problem  I see  So your idea is  Alright  You know the phrase  Rock bottom  You know pushing somebody  To the point of  Let's get him to that point  Yeah  If he wants to go  I'll walk with him  Right  Let's get to the edge  Yeah  And then you'll kick his ass  Right off the cliff  And watch him climb back up  Yeah  Cause you know  You know  You'll stop yourself  Right at the edge  Of that cliff  But if it means  Chuck and Roland off  Yeah 
[03:53:00]  Start climbing buddy  Well  You can use the exercise  You could  You really could  That's fine  It's like when I tell him  You should get this ice cream  And what happens  Four people  Oh that's great ice cream  Yeah  Roland goes  I love this ice cream  I love  These other people  Come up behind us  They go  Yeah that's really good ice cream  I love Roland's defense  In all this  Like I'm sitting there  Going like  Troy  You're leading Roland  To be completely unhealthy  He's like  Sam  In my defense  I know where the most  Delicious ice cream is  I guess Roland 
[03:53:30]  Roland knows good food  I understand  Roland could be  Roland could be a millionaire  Off of a food blog  He knows that much about food  Well he's experienced  Very  Very  He has good taste  And the people behind  And lots of it  Yeah and the guy goes  Oh my god  That's great ice cream  I know  And then I just said  It goes good  To be watched  Real Housewives  And that guy's girlfriend  Went  Why don't you start  A food blog  Or something like that  At least  At least so something  Because I mean  You're doing horrible 
[03:54:00]  Things to your body  At least  I treat it like  A pagan temple  A pagan temple  I don't know  Pagan  Oh oh oh  Pagan temple  Oh  At least if you had  A food blog  You could point it  In the direction  Of something constructive  Yeah  I'll do that  No you won't  Were you  I don't know  Yeah probably not  Probably not  Dave in New Jersey  What's up Sammy  How are you buddy  Good  I uh  I just can't wait  Till Troy  Looks like Ben Stiller  At the end of Dodgeball 
[03:54:30]  Eating a bucket of chicken  Sitting by himself  You think that happens  One day Troy  You just get depressed  And you lose motivation  For the gym  And you just become  A big 400 pound dude  With a handlebar mustache  He does  He goes  Order the food  And Troy goes  I hate myself  You do  Do I say  I love myself  Another one  Sugar  You really are  You have like  You're verging  Very close to  Teenage girl  Eating disorder status  No  No  Because I watch  Everything I eat  This week  That's what I mean  But I'll be careful 
[03:55:00]  All week long  And I'll hit the gym hard  That's what I mean  Like paying so close  Attention to everything  You eat  Because when you get older  Your metabolism slows down  And if I don't be careful  I can  I could get big  I know I can  You could roll it out  I could  You don't want that  Well I mean  I've made it this far  Right  So basically you're saying  God no  Do I not want that  No I wish he would  Head more in my direction  But you know  He can  But instead  You decided  Follow his route  Well he knows  The route that I followed  He knows good food  It is a delicious food journey  Or adventure  Yes

That's what I'm trying  To find out  Do they like  And would you get it  From a girl or a guy?  Would you be comfortable  With a man  Giving your girlfriend 
[03:57:30]  A happy ending massage?  I know you've stated before  You're a fan of  Happy ending massages  I love them  Why don't you go  For the couple massage?  That's what I'm saying  But I don't know  If they give happy endings  Would you be okay  If it was a dude  That was fingering  Your chick to completion?  I mean I prefer a girl  But  It's Valentine's Day  But if the guy  You don't know  Who the guy is  Right  You know  And if he's really good  If he's really good  You think that's a better thing?  Yeah  You're not worried  About being like  I can't finger you that well  Nah  I mean if you're 
[03:58:00]  If you're paying money  When you're paying money  They need to be professionals  Right  So if she comes home  And she's like  Troy why don't you ever  Finger me that well  Then you would be like  Well you don't exactly pay me  The kind of money  That I just paid that dude  For you  Well first of all  She wouldn't say that  She wouldn't?  Nope  Good for her  Good for her  But she might  Nope  And you could tell her  That you're not a professional  I would  I'd have to  I'd have a lot of explaining to do  That's why I would never  Set that up for Jess  Yeah  I would never show her that experience  I would never show her what an actual good time is  What about with a girl? 
[03:58:30]  With a girl?  No because she'd probably go lesbian  She probably  Any alternative to me  She would take it  So I couldn't  I wouldn't set her up for that  Couldn't do it  Really?  Too much risk  You wouldn't want to know about that?  If she was a lesbian?  No if she went and got  A happy ending massage  I would like to know about that  But she would  I'm telling you  She would end up  Leaving me for  Would you like to see her with another girl?  I would like to see her with another girl  I would not like her to  Leave me for another girl  That'd be hot  Yeah if it was just like  Watching her with another girl hook up 
[03:59:00]  Yeah  It'd be fucking awesome  Yeah  You know what we should do?  Huh  See if our chicks are  You know  It would be weird?  We could both watch  And we could like  If I'm watching  I'm probably gonna pull it out and whack  Me too  That's weird  No because before we'll like high five  Or you know what we'll do?  I'll be on barbecue  Jesse  No Roland you can't come  You can't come  Then it'd be really weird  But what we'll do is  Like I'll point at your boner  And you'll point at my boner  And we'll just kind of laugh  And then it will ease the tension in the room  Would it? 
[03:59:30]  Yeah  And our chicks would just go to town  On each other  And we'd jerk off  And maybe jerk each other off  And we'll see how  We'll see where it goes  Should we pitch that for a Valentine's idea?  Yeah  Who should go  Like we'll go to dinner together?  Yeah  And then at dinner we'll pitch it  Good thinking  This is why I'm not a smooth operator  Like you are Troy  I would have said  Yeah let me just go home  And be like  Hey Josh  You wanna hook up with Troy's chick?  Yeah  No  It's like we're out  Like we'll have a couple drinks  And then if it goes wrong  Be like  Oh I was drunk  I don't know what I was thinking  Yeah  She'd be like  What?  That's  No that's disgusting  And then we'd look  We're fucking kidding  Yeah 
[04:00:00]  We're joking  But if they're like  That's a great idea  Like cool let's go  Let's go do it right now  Yeah  Whoever's place is closer  I don't care whose place we do it at  I don't care if we do it at the restaurant  That'd be fine  You know if we can get that done  I would do it in a heartbeat  You kidding me?  That's it  We can take him to the Mighty Quinns  But the two of us shouldn't be nude  Like it's one thing to pull it out  But I'm not gonna take my shirt off  I gotta be comfortable though  You would wanna get buck naked?  Yeah  Leave socks on  I'll leave the socks on but that's it  Alright  Well as long as you'll  As long as you'll meet me on that  Compromise
