<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Anthony’s furious rant about consistently receiving poorly toasted bagels from a New York City deli.  He used extremely offensive language to describe the deli workers and the city itself, culminating in a vow to leave New York. Opie shared his own preventative measure: bringing his own food.  This was followed by a discussion of their “Assault on the Media” stunt, where employee Danny successfully interrupted a live news broadcast with a show promotional sign. Danny, present in the studio, recounted the humorous chaos, including the unexpected appearance of pigeons.  Video of the event was available online at opianthony.com.

The show then transitioned to a news story about Sandra Beth Geisel, a 42-year-old teacher who had sex with underage male students.  The hosts discussed the story with explicit language, their reactions ranging from amusement to condemnation, punctuated by audio clips from news reports. This segued into a debate on Queen's continued touring without Freddie Mercury, featuring audio samples of their new lead singer, which the hosts heavily criticized.

A listener call-in segment followed, featuring birthday wishes for Jimmy Norton.  Listeners shared anecdotes, highlighting the hosts’ contrasting personalities, and one recounted a bad experience with a computer-generated Valentine's Day match. The upcoming X Games broadcast in Los Angeles was announced.

The next segment featured numerous listener calls detailing experiences with teachers and babysitters, ranging from sexual encounters to less explicit interactions. One caller described a three-year relationship with his 16-year-old babysitter, even mentioning playing "Strip Connect 4." Another caller shared a positive experience with a "wow" sticker. A lengthy call from Cowhead and Brent of a Tampa-based radio show dominated this segment. They discussed their careers, opinions of other radio personalities (including Howard Stern and Eric Logan), and their precarious job situation due to a new Spanish-focused general manager, hinting at potential job loss.  They mentioned having a “sex teacher” guest similar to the Deborah LaFave case.  The segment included numerous sexually suggestive comments and discussions of inappropriate teacher-student relationships, and the possibility of Cowhead and Brent receiving a "golden ticket." Additional callers shared personal stories of inappropriate teacher behavior and a wife’s suspected infidelity.  Mick Ferrari, a "celebrity stylist gossip guy" and regular guest, was briefly mentioned.

The following segment started with Laura, a caller who recounted her explicit sexual relationship with her French teacher as a teenager. The hosts reacted with shock and humor, interjecting comments and questions. This led to a discussion about the legal and societal implications of female teachers having sexual relationships with students, contrasting the treatment of male and female perpetrators.  This spurred a debate on racial profiling in terrorism prevention, with multiple callers offering varied perspectives and strong opinions. This portion included tangents, such as a discussion of a malfunctioning space shuttle repair broadcast, a caller named Barb describing her sexual proclivities and online dating profile, and a bit from Drew and Mike's radio show about a gay male orgy. The segment concluded with a "Who Farted?" game and a discussion about a promotional error on their show.  The tone remained sexually explicit, irreverent, and provocative.

A significant portion of the broadcast was dedicated to the "Who Farted?" game, with the hosts (and possibly Jimmy) attempting to identify the source of various pre-recorded fart sounds. This involved detailed descriptions of each fart's unique qualities. The game was punctuated by digressions into topics such as anecdotes about the Fonz from *Happy Days*, racial profiling, and media hypocrisy regarding hate crime coverage. A caller criticized the game as boring.  A news story about a Hasidic man assaulted with anti-Semitic slurs was discussed, contrasting it with the media's perceived disproportionate focus on other issues. The segment concluded with a "mystery guest" fart and a discussion about violent video games, particularly "Bully" and the protests from "Peaceaholics."  Vulgar language and offensive topics were prevalent throughout.

The final segment focused on video games, specifically the violent content in games like Grand Theft Auto and Bully.  The hosts debated the link between violent video games and real-world violence, dismissing claims of direct causality without providing supporting data. This included humorous tangents like comparing the Bully protagonist's appearance to Jimmy Norton and jokes about flatulence.  A birthday celebration for Jimmy Norton with a muffin and candle occurred.  Dwayne, a caller, noted the resemblance between Jimmy Norton and the Bully protagonist.  A GameFly commercial aired. Several callers (Eric, Sean, and Kevin) shared their perspectives. The show ended with a reminder of the upcoming X Games broadcast in Los Angeles and off-air banter between the hosts, referencing a broken item and the threat of someone named Ben.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  You're laughing in the wrong places. 
[00:04:00]  Ben, where's the quality?  He rocks.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you stink.  You are cordially invited.  You are cordially invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  The show is a disaster.  If you have any poo, make it now.  But enough of this palaver.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Spacewalk to save the shuttle. 
[00:04:30]  Next on a current affair.  A dangerous maneuver.  A dangerous maneuver.  Not too much pressure.  Welcome to the Opian Anthony program.  A couple things.  You're listening to a virus.  Oh, you don't know it yet, but give it time.  You'll be infected.  You'll understand.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  We like to say spread the virus.  And you can get your official spread the virus t-shirts if you go to opiananthony.com. 
[00:05:00]  Thank you.  I can't take this anymore.  I can't deal with the way the fucking food is around this shithole fucking city we live in.  This shithole fucking melting pot, they call it.  It's fucking foreigners that can't do shit right.  Where are the white people?  Holy shit! 
[00:05:30]  Give me white people.  Oh my God!  What's wrong, Anthony?  Well, my first attempt at my most difficult order that I always give every morning.  My food order.  Oh, it's so difficult.  It's a bagel toasted with a side of cream cheese.  Woo!  I asked for fucking filet mignon, medium rare.  Send it back.  There's not enough capers on it. 
[00:06:00]  What?  I...  I...  And the only reason I get this shit fucking filler every morning is because it's so easy  that it probably won't aggravate me because it probably, odds are it won't come here wrong.  But every goddamn day, some dopey savage can't fucking put together a toasted bagel properly.  This is the second attempt at my bagel for the day.  The first one had some kind of red shit on it, which could have been ketchup or fucking blood. 
[00:06:30]  Who knows?  But I sure as shit wasn't going to eat it.  So in disgust, I slam dunked it in the garbage, which a new one is coming over by me right now.  Thank you, Eric.  Because the second attempt, this bagel here is...  You can't hear a thing, can you?  I'm ripping it in front of the mic.  Is it making a crackling toasted sound?  No.  Because it's not fucking toast.  It's not fucking toasted. 
[00:07:00]  Look at the side of cream cheese.  It's a vat of cream cheese.  I don't know.  The intern's got to get that toasted.  That's got to be an intern.  If the intern asks for it to be toasted, they're assuming it's toasted, though.  I'll fucking starve.  I could give a shit.  I've had it.  This city eats my fucking cock.  I hate New York City.  People out there in the rest of the country, have a great time where you live. 
[00:07:30]  Don't come visit here.  It's a shithole.  It's full of savage animals that are trying to kill you through your bloody bagel or a bomb bus or something.  I hate New York City.  I hate it.  I'm leaving this city as quickly as I can.  The second we're done working at this station, I am moving.  I'm going to fucking Iceland or somewhere.  I don't care where it is.  Well, I got a few ideas that could get us fired.  Please use them.  Please just break them out. 
[00:08:00]  I have fucking had it.  People can't get shit right.  The incompetence that is going on, it amazes me.  I'm dumbfounded.  That something as simple as a fucking toasted bagel can't be dealt with professionally and just be done with.  You got to do what I do.  You just bring in your own food.  Yeah, I'm going to have to do that.  We were laughing the other day at Opie.  Opie is a genius. 
[00:08:30]  Bringing in his peanut butter and jelly, his cereal, his oatmeal with fruit that he fucking concocts.  He's like a lab tech in the goddamn office.  He's mixing beakers and test tubes with milk and blueberries.  I can't handle it.  See, breakfast is very important to me, so it has to be right every day.  And that's what I do.  Harry, I pray.  I pray for your safety that you ask to be toasted.  Please be honest with me.  I know that you have a toast because you always have it in foil, so I asked for it to be toasted. 
[00:09:00]  Thank you.  I was in such a rush to get it here before showtime, I didn't check inside the bag.  I thought that...  No, you shouldn't have to.  If you asked for a toasted bagel, you would think a rag-headed fuck animal could actually get it done.  Could get it done right.  In defense of the ragheads, these people were Hispanic.  Whatever!  White people!  Where'd you go?  The great Pick-A-Bagel, which was supposed to be the place to get bagels.  I guess you better go back. 
[00:09:30]  Pick-A-Bagel.  There's Bagel in the name.  They specialize in bagels.  You would think they could get it right.  You think maybe toasted is something they don't hear very often?  I'll have a toasted bagel.  Pick a bagel.  Take it out.  Not toasted.  Would you like me to go get another one?  I can do that for you, sir.  I had it.  I'm not eating now.  I'm not eating.  I'll wither away even further.  That's it.  My goal weight now is 95 pounds.  I'll give that a try. 
[00:10:00]  Un-fucking-believable.  You gotta get Sweetie a bagel.  His blood sugar's low.  There you go.  Blood sugar.  I'll eat a fucking sugar packet from the coffee machine.  After you get that bagel, you'll do better.  I'll be fine.  That's so funny.  You just said your target weight's 95 pounds because I love that Celebrity Fit Club.  Yeah.  Not that I'm a celebrity, but I want to go on Celebrity Fit Club.  Yeah.  And this, you know, I'm like, what, a buck 60?  Yeah.  And I want to lose a lot of weight on Celebrity Fit Club and have them, like, saying, way 
[00:10:30]  to go.  Yeah, that's it.  Way to go.  Good job.  Your target weight loss for next week is seven pounds.  I could do that, sir, and just keep showing up week after week, more emaciated, withering  away.  And they gotta compliment me on my weight loss because I'm doing such a great job.  That's what I'm doing.  I'm calling Bob Eatman, our agent, later, and I'm trying to get into The Machinist 2.  Right.  That's gonna be my movie.  Well, that's how my bit was gonna end, but thanks.  Oh, really?  I was gonna say, until I look like Christian Bale from The Machinist. 
[00:11:00]  Machinist.  I can't take it anymore.  You gotta bring your own food in.  Everyone laughs at me, but I know exactly what I'm getting every single morning.  What happened to the corner store where you can go in and say, hi, how do you do,  to a guy named Bill, or Mark, or Sam behind the counter, and say, I'd like a bagel, please?  Toast it.  And he'd say, yes, sir, quite a hot day we're having today. 
[00:11:30]  Yes, it is.  And you wait and get your bagel, and he goes, have yourself a great day in this great country  of ours, the United States of America.  And you knew leaving, you didn't have to check.  Because you know that Bob, or Sam, or Peter, he got you what you wanted, and you get back  to where you go, and there it is.  All perfect the way you asked for it.  What happened to those days? 
[00:12:00]  They celebrate this melting pot in this city.  It's, it's a toilet bowl.  It's not a melting pot.  It's a commode.  I've had it.  The incompetence in this country.  It's beyond me.  No one gives a shit.  No one cares about workmanship, their job, doing a good job. 
[00:12:30]  It just doesn't happen anymore.  They don't have the energy to learn English.  They don't have the energy to toast a goddamn bagel.  Had it.  You know we have a toaster here, right?  Not the point.  We could have taken your bagel, it looked nice, and just toasted it up for you.  No?  Absolutely not the point.  Oh, why don't we just get a fucking dough mixer in here, and a big bagel oven, too?  We'll just whip it up before the show.  Why not? 
[00:13:00]  Let's get a few cows in here we can slaughter for some burgers later.  Why not?  The point is, it's a fucking bagel.  I, I, I picked the easiest bit of food for someone to get, so it doesn't get fucked up  and aggravate me in the morning.  And that can't even be done right.  First I get a, a, a crime scene bagel.  I don't know what the fuck that was.  What was on it?  I don't know.  I saw the ring. 
[00:13:30]  God, it was on the other side that I started eating from.  I'm biting, eating, and then I turned around and said, oh, great, what is this?  What the, what is this?  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus.  All right, welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Hey, good morning.  Good morning, Anthony.  Good morning, little Jimmy Norton.  Hi, boys.  Oh, my God.  It is Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, I believe, right?  Wednesday?  It's Wednesday again?  Yeah, cool.  If you're looking for a WOW sticker, the address is up on opianthony.com. 
[00:14:00]  We're signing WOW stickers today because we have to get these out to some faithful listeners.  If you need a WOW sticker and you don't want to go onto the website right at this moment  and you have a pen, it's 111 West 57th Street, New York, New York, 10019.  All right.  And you have to send a self-addressed stamped envelope because we're cheap bastards at this company.  And, of course, WOW is very simple.  You throw the WOW sticker on your car. 
[00:14:30]  If you don't have a WOW sticker, you can make a homemade WOW sign.  And there's a lot of ladies across this fine nation of ours that will show you their fun bags if you have a WOW in your car.  It's been working for many, many years.  Okay?  Right.  So make sure you get a WOW on your car and join the festivities.  Speaking of, well, I was going to say speaking of WOW because I thought it was a WOW sign on TV this morning, but it wasn't.  That's right.  What?  Our own Danny.  Yes.  See, we do assaults on the media on a weekly basis ourselves. 
[00:15:00]  We don't just leave it to the listeners to promote the show.  We also help out in the effort.  Those are exhibitions.  That's right.  So people can get an idea of how they're done.  Well, we had another assault on the media here in New York City on Channel 5.  It was hilarious all of a sudden.  And Craig, I guess, from Fox 5.  Good day, New York, I think it is.  Good day.  She was talking about how it's going to be really hot today.  That's the big story in New York City that we're going to get up to almost 100 degrees.  And she was out doing her stupid weather story.  And next thing you know, Danny comes running in with his sign, the big cartoon sign that says, 
[00:15:30]  Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio, spread the virus.  Big smile on his face, cell phone plastered to his ear.  It was really, really funny.  The video is going to be up on opianthony.com in the near future.  The latest assault on the media.  They're happening pretty much every day now.  You can tell when he's going to come into frame because a bunch of pigeons fly out of the scene.  Oh, really?  I didn't see that.  It's great.  Out of nowhere.  Well, Danny is in studio, too.  What happened, we were watching live, which is so uncomfortable. 
[00:16:00]  I would rather, like, all of a sudden see you got mail, and then it's some listener from around the country.  You know what you're seeing is already taped.  You know what I mean?  For some reason, it feels better that way.  But to see one of these going down live is just so nerve-wracking for everybody involved, including us just sitting on a couch and just watching Danny work his ass off.  You're watching smiling reporters, and you know what's going to happen.  They don't have a clue.  It's up already?  Yeah.  It's up on OPNAnthony.com, the latest assault on the media. 
[00:16:30]  Danny in studio.  What's up, Danny?  What's going on, fellas?  Very, very good.  It was on screen for, like, three seconds, perfectly framed with a nice smile from Danny as he's on the cell phone going, look what I did to you again.  We heard a lot of, I guess, Nathaniel was...  He was my co-pilot.  He was my wingman today.  He was coordinating from here in the studio, watching the TV and telling you when to go, and I heard him going, go, go, where is he, where is he, go, and the woman was on screen for quite a while before you popped in. 
[00:17:00]  What happened?  Well, the thing is, with that shot, they were set up to face a completely open area, and the only available spot for me to hide out was behind this horse monument, which is probably about 30 feet away.  So, when he says, go, go, go, I actually have to, like, creep up behind the truck.  Oh, my God.  Can I interrupt?  Who noticed the pigeons?  You did, Anthony?  I believe Nathaniel noticed the pigeons flying out.  Holy crap.  If you go to opianthony.com and see the latest assault on the media by Danny, who's in studio, there are pigeons just as you're looking at the screen to the right. 
[00:17:30]  And there's about, I don't know, five or six pigeons, and all of a sudden they just start flying away like crazy.  No, there's a lot more, it turns out.  Nathaniel said it looks like a John Woo movie.  Yeah, and then all of a sudden that means that Danny's on his way, and sure enough, he jumps into frame.  That is hilarious.  Plus, you could also catch, if you notice the reporter before I come into the shot, her eyes actually turn away, and she sees me. 
[00:18:00]  Uh-oh.  Before I hit the frame, and then they went back to the studio for a little bit, trying to stall.  See that, Jimmy?  God, every assault on the media has a little thing.  A little something.  A little something, something.  This one, you've got to watch the pigeons.  Watch the pigeons before Danny shows up in frame.  Very good.  Can I get one of those seat cushions?  Oh, my God.  Oh, you got one, sir.  Danny has had a lot of successful assaults on the media, more than anyone else, I do believe.  Very, very good. 
[00:18:30]  There it is.  It's hopinganthony.com.  And we fucked them up pretty good, because the first time, we should throw that online, too.  They didn't know what to do.  Yeah, she's something coming.  They cut away from her.  They cut away from her, and all of a sudden, the anchors are in their chairs in the studio.  They don't know what the hell's going on.  They're like, oh, ugh.  And then they finally went back to the live shot, because they had no choice, and then you nailed them.  Damn.  You could tell they panicked, and they were just trying to fill a minute.  Yeah, very, very good.  Congratulations to Danny.  Thank you.  You know how sick of those dumb cartoon faces the media's getting? 
[00:19:00]  They're tired of it.  Yeah, they're getting smarter and smarter here in New York.  They're setting up with all sorts of angles, which make it harder.  They're really thinking out their live shots.  It's very, very obvious to us, because we're pretty much professionals at this by now.  A lot harder now.  A lot harder.  So we're going to have to count on the rest of the country to keep this assault on the media thing going eventually.  Jerry in Connecticut.  What's up, Jerry?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I got a great idea.  Well, not a great idea, but why don't you send Anthony down with a microphone to that bagel shop to see if he can get it fixed? 
[00:19:30]  No.  Come on, go down there.  It's not a wacky bit, my friend.  You need more white people.  It's not a wacky bit, my friend.  No?  I'm just, I...  Look, I know it seems petty.  I understand.  It's the bigger issue here that you're not seeing.  It's not just my bagel.  Me and my stupid bagel.  Who gives a flying fuck, right?  I'm the only one that really can't.  You think I'm yelling into this mic so people go, poor Anthony can't get his bagel? 
[00:20:00]  I know you don't give a shit if I get my bagel or not.  That's not the point.  The point of this whole thing is the bigger picture.  It's the incompetence that goes on in this country.  And I see it a lot in this city.  I don't live elsewhere, so I don't know what's going on.  Perhaps I'm wrong and it's just nationwide.  There's more white people in Connecticut, Anthony.  Yes, perhaps I will move to Connecticut.  All I'm saying is it's a bigger issue.  There's just... 
[00:20:30]  Every day, there's people that just don't seem to give a shit about anything that they do.  Whether it's toasting a bagel or putting a friggin' building up.  It's just bullshit going on.  That's all I'm trying to say.  You think I'm trying to garner sympathy for my fucking bagel?  Do you think I'm actually sitting here thinking people care and pity me for my bagel?  Stop.  Of course not. 
[00:21:00]  You should all, though, pity yourselves that we have to live in this country like this.  Can't get what the hell you want anymore.  I love America, Anthony.  Me too.  So do I.  I adore this country.  I think it's the greatest country on earth, even though I've only been to one other country.  I love people that do that one.  Yeah.  It's the greatest country in the world.  Well, how do you know?  How many countries have you been to?  Uh, none. 
[00:21:30]  None countries.  You're assuming a lot, my friend.  And you know, every time you say bagel, there's a good portion of this listening audience that just mumbles Jew food.  Yeah, I know.  It's Jew food.  All right, moving on, because we have such a busy show.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  We discussed that already.  We already discussed our latest assault on the media.  Opie Anthony, no, the Opie, Paul Anka, and Jimmy show.  That's what I'm getting on Instagram feedback.  I'm just getting wham, wham, wham.  Bagel gets toasted.  I'm getting wham, wham, wham. 
[00:22:00]  I get that one.  Ant, your bagel's here.  Oh, boy.  I'm sure it's fine.  Wait, this is your third bagel of the morning.  Someone had commented, uh, oh, it was on the phone.  Okay.  Is he still here?  Uh, yeah, potato head.  Okay.  Oh, what happened, Jimmy?  No, no, no, Harry just gave me back $11 out of a $20 for a bagel.  Maybe he had my other breakfast, too.  I got your breakfast. 
[00:22:30]  Okay, cool.  Thanks, buddy.  What do you think, Ant?  Ant, you're inspecting that bagel.  Because now I really am taking a close look.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  It's just a knife.  Relax.  Yeah, it's coming.  He'll get a knife for you.  They don't know any better.  So the knife wasn't in the bag.  Relax.  At 45 degree angle.  Jesus.  Let's go to potato head.  It looks like Anthony's third bagel is a good one.  Potato head, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys? 
[00:23:00]  Hi.  Hey, I just wanted to do a comment on what you were talking about for the 6 o'clock hour.  Yeah.  Anthony, I'm a cheaper bastard than you.  Yeah.  Wait, what are you talking about?  Anthony was just talking about this just before showtime, how on the instant feedback, you  guys commented about stuff that's being played in the 6 a.m. hour here on the East Coast.  Yeah.  And we have no idea what they're playing because we set that up like weeks in advance.  So what bid are you talking about?  It was the price of his wedding ring.  Oh, okay.  Ah.  All right. 
[00:23:30]  I went to Walmart and paid less than $100.  You paid less than $100 for a wedding ring?  That's right.  And does she know the difference?  Cheap bastard, huh?  Well, are you still married?  Oh, no, no.  Not because of the wedding ring, no.  No?  Yeah, just got divorced here about three weeks ago.  So how much did the ring end up costing?  Oh, sure.  That's about $2,000 a month.  That's a lot of cash.  Yeah, my kids are worth it. 
[00:24:00]  That's all child support.  Child support.  I ain't paying no out.  How much was the wedding ring?  The wedding ring was between $70 and $95.  I can't remember exactly.  They really sell rings that cheap over there?  At Walmart.  With the little diamond chip in it?  I had no idea.  Yeah, I think that was like a tenth of a carrot or some shit like that.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Hey, one other thing.  Oh, God, no.  Opie, yesterday when you mentioned maybe having listeners vote on the winners of the 
[00:24:30]  thought on the media, it's weird because I called in about five minutes before that  to suggest the exact same thing.  Well, I guess I ripped you off who, who, who.  Oh, no big deal.  I was just thinking it was kind of odd because you're...  No, it's not really odd, sir.  It's a Captain Obvious type thing.  Yeah, because...  We're a very interactive radio show, so why not get the listeners involved?  And have them vote for the best assault on the media for the year. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  I mean, you know, the person answering the phone just said, okay, and hung up.  You know, so I was like, oh, the end of that.  Then you mentioned it.  But anyway, it's punching out.  All right.  All right.  Bye, guys.  All right, there.  Thank you.  All right.  Busy show.  So let's see who we have coming in today.  Oh, let's look.  Guests on the sheet here today.  I have a...  Somebody spilled white out all over my paper.  Well, maybe it's on page... 
[00:25:30]  It didn't cover the little black lines in between.  Mine didn't print out properly.  Well, maybe it's on...  Cut the whole top off.  Maybe it's on page three.  Maybe it's on...  Oh, wait.  It's got to be here.  Yeah.  There's no guests once again today.  See, all this wow put in the guest thing.  Yeah.  Maybe...  To make it look like there is a guest.  Maybe that should be the exasperated explanation when you see that we have no guests.  That it's empty.  Wow.  Wow.  How much?  Look at that.  No guests again.  Well, I booked a guest. 
[00:26:00]  And our guest yesterday...  Because now we're keeping close attention here.  Yesterday's guests were booked by XM themselves.  Not by the professional booker that we supposedly have working for this radio program.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rob Dibble works for XM and Brian Herter drives the XM car.  Mm-hmm.  Two fine interviews, by the way.  But the booker had nothing to do with them.  But they're...  They say they're working hard for us.  Yeah.  All right.  Well...  Thanks. 
[00:26:30]  Thanks for nothing.  Thank you very much.  Uh, here's a quickie.  Remember yesterday we were talking about Queen?  Yeah.  Good old Joey Paisano.  Good friend of mine.  And ours.  Why are you calling him a Queen?  What did you say?  Oh, really?  You talk about Queen and then Joey Paisano.  Joey, you heard that, right?  Listen to the replay.  And you tell me what I said.  And then you take care of Anthony on your own time.  I'm trying to remember the tie-in between Queen and Joey Paisano.  Joey Paisano loves Queen.  And Joey Paisano wants us to use all our muscle to get him a backstage pass to meet Queen. 
[00:27:00]  Joey Paisano is spending about $6,000 to see Queen.  So he's asking you for a favor?  He's asking me for a favor, yes.  And, uh, I told him he was insane.  Because without Freddie Mercury, Queen, how good could Queen really be?  It's not Queen.  It's not Queen.  But these bands have decided to start doing this.  You know, uh, uh, uh, the Doors there without Jim Morrison.  They're still touring? 
[00:27:30]  Yep.  With what's his name from the cult?  Yeah, Ian Asbury.  Who's a great singer.  But I don't want to hear him singing Doors songs.  It's not the Doors.  I don't want to be, you know, tricked into thinking I might be actually listening to the Doors.  The Doors...  The Doors were Jim Morrison.  Simple as that.  Yeah.  Simple as that.  Yes, Robbie Krieger.  I get it.  Yes, Rayman Zirk.  Blah, blah, blah.  And Densmore, a complete waste as far as that band went, by the way.  Anyone could have done the little tapping drums.  There was a million guys doing the little cute tapping drums back in the day. 
[00:28:00]  And he's the most bitter guy out of the whole bunch.  Really?  Oh, my God.  Just cash your paycheck and shut the fuck up.  You had nothing to do with the Doors.  Matter of fact, someone's doing the tapping drums under the console right now.  That's me and my nervous habit.  I've been doing it for years.  Shut up.  It's going dunk, dunk, dunk.  Rayman Zirk got the Doors back together, whatever.  Well, it's just him and Robbie, and then they got Ian there.  And Densmore, a bitter fuck that he is, said, no way.  Yeah.  No way. 
[00:28:30]  He had nothing to do with the band.  But Jim Morrison was.  Yeah, and there's other bands, like Nirvana without Kurt Cobain, Hello.  Was never going to happen.  Of course not.  And these other bands, why is Queen going on without Freddie Mercury?  Freddie Mercury was the whole band.  And a lot of Queen fans out there emailing me saying,  Brian May.  Brian May.  What about Brian May?  Yeah, he was great.  Yeah, whatever.  Their unique sound.  Whatever.  But Freddie Mercury was Queen. 
[00:29:00]  End of discussion.  Yeah.  You know, it's like, if Brian May was that talented,  couldn't he have started his own band kind of like Dave Grohl did?  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  Dave Grohl was quite successful after leaving the Nirvana thing, right?  Brian May wasn't that successful after, you know, Freddie Mercury died.  Just milking the Queen thing.  Well, I think he put out a few solo projects and played with other people,  but never really made it on his own, now did he? 
[00:29:30]  So how great is Brian May, really?  Who sang with Queen on that, one of those benefit things they did a few years back?  I don't know.  No one remembers that one?  I really don't know that one.  The answer to that.  Someone came out and sang.  It sounded really good.  Can't remember who it was.  Dio?  No.  It wasn't Dio.  So it turns out that Queen is moving on with Paul Rogers,  and they're playing on the East Coast and the West Coast, I guess.  A few shows here and there.  I guess they've been doing this in Europe, someone was telling me.  And they're selling out like crazy, and great. 
[00:30:00]  Have fun, you know.  It's something I don't have an interest in.  Oh, it was George Michael.  George Michael.  Oh, that's right.  Okay.  Yeah, okay.  I do remember that.  And he did a pretty good job, you know.  I guess you need that fag up front with Queen for it to really sound good.  But, yeah, he did a pretty good job with Queen.  I need a gay singer with an overbite.  Ow.  Anyone?  So we got some samples of Queen with Paul Rogers on vocals. 
[00:30:30]  Because we were discussing this yesterday.  Paul Rogers, of course, from Bad Company.  Because I just said, eck, like, no way.  But at least let's be fair and then listen to a couple samples and see what everyone thinks.  The new Queen with Paul Rogers on vocals, okay?  Little taste.  You can hear the Brian May guitar. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  That distinctive sound.  Eck.  Well, you're a boy, need a beat, not a bird in the street.  Gonna be a big fan of the lake.  The one only way to take this place.  If you come, can I'll come for the place. 
[00:31:30]  We will, we will rock you.  Will you rock me, baby?  We will, we will rock you.  Ah, ah, ah.  Buddy, you're a young man, a hard band, shouting in the street.  Gonna take on the balls of the lake.  Blood on the lake.  Big to space.  We've been doing well.  Oh, we'll be saying we will, we will rock you.  It sounds like a cover band.  It sounds like. 
[00:32:00]  It sounds like a bad cover band.  It sounds like karaoke.  I mean, Paul Rogers has an alright voice and all, but it's, it's not Queen.  It's not Queen.  It's not Queen.  We are the champions.  Sounds like a bad company song. 
[00:32:30]  We are the champions.  We are the champions.  We are the champions.  And when the stars are made of you, I remember still standing in my way.  Let the audience sing this song. 
[00:33:00]  I love when bands do that.  Hey, ass, I came to hear you sing it, not 10,000 people.  Here comes the difficult part. 
[00:33:30]  Let the crowd sing it.  Awful.  No.  Nah.  Joey, six grand?  Something like that.  Six large, six G's?  Something like that.  He'll enjoy it, though, and that's fine.  And I'm sure other people will enjoy it, but personally, I don't like it. 
[00:34:00]  You think they'll bring a little round table up right to the front of the stage with some champagne on it?  Put it down there.  Him and his gal can sit there and watch.  Paul Rogers will give him a little salute from the stage.  All right.  We're going to take our first break.  It's awful, right?  That is really bad.  No business him being up front.  First break. 
[00:34:30]  On the way.  We've got to get back into the sex teacher thing.  Oh, the story's so hot.  That story's exploding today, and we were just touching on it as the show ended yesterday.  She's a drunk.  Turns out she's a drunk.  Is that part of the deal?  Yeah.  Nice.  That makes this story even hotter.  This story gets hotter by the day.  Hot drunk mom.  So we'll definitely get into this in a few minutes.  Was this the story?  No, we had another version of that.  Okay.  And we've got some audio and stuff.  So we'll do that after the break.  Also, I think we're going to do a fart thing today. 
[00:35:00]  Who Farted?  A new game on the Opie and Anthony show.  Really?  Who Farted?  And other things.  We're just...  Oh, well.  Wait.  Beach Danger on Fox.  What?  Beach Danger.  I just saw the big graphic they put up.  Well, let's get Travis TV on it.  Beach Danger.  Fox 5.  Good day, New York.  Beach Danger.  Stupid news.  Stupid news. 
[00:35:30]  Ben's hog is just big enough for my baby.  Well, I do have big tips, goddammit.  Goddammit, what nice things.  We'll whip them out Wednesday.  We'll whip them out Wednesday.  We'll become alone and so it will be when you die.  I will go nothing.  Will you be remembered?  You'll be desired.  Don't forget the show is going on the road.  We're going to be in L.A. at the X Games this Friday. 
[00:36:00]  I don't have the details in front of me at this moment, but we're changing the show time.  Oh, there it is.  Thank you, Eric.  We're going to be broadcasting Friday from the X Games, 2 to 6 p.m. East Coast time.  That would be 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. on the West Coast.  And like the old Pioneer days, it's going to take us a month to get out there and get back.  Yeah, we've got to take tomorrow off.  Then we've got to take Monday off for some reason just to do four hours of radio.  We're sending like ten people.  We've got the money they're spending on this. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, I'm not complaining.  It's ridiculous.  It just amazes me the difference between satellite radio and commercial radio.  This would never happen on commercial radio.  Never, never, never those cheap fucks.  Absolutely not.  Are we all leaving at the same time and everything?  Same plane out.  Same flight?  That's right.  Oh, party plane.  Same flight out and about five different flights back on Sunday.  Oh, is that what the deal is?  Something like that, yeah.  Well, the flight's at 7 a.m., which means Oop gets up at 5.40 to pack. 
[00:37:00]  Right.  And we get picked up at 6.30 and we head right over there for the 7 o'clock flight.  5.40 to pack.  He's the worst.  It's fucking, we're leaving in ten minutes.  Dude, I've got to go home and pack.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't you pack?  I don't know.  I just don't pack.  It's a weird thing I have to do.  I have to pack last minute, always.  Oh, my God.  Like, I could not go home today and pack for tomorrow.  I don't know why.  I will be in a complete panic tomorrow morning.  The alarm will go off about 4, 4.15, and I think the pickup is at about 4.45, 5 a.m., 
[00:37:30]  and within that time I will shower, eat, and hopefully pack for L.A.  See, that's ridiculous.  I am on the complete opposite end of the spectrum.  You know what I do?  I go home after the show, pack everything up, put it in the truck, and I drive to a hotel  I already have booked right near Newark Airport.  And then in the morning, I just, I'm there already.  I don't have to worry about traffic, no bullshit, nothing.  I am there already.  I'm the king of last minute stuff.  I don't know why.  It's the only way I work. 
[00:38:00]  It's the weirdest thing.  I've tried to pack ahead of time.  It just doesn't work.  Could you stack them up today, like, on your couch?  Even if you don't put them away, like, just so you can still see them.  Maybe your thing is you're afraid you're not going to be able to...  The trouble is, he's wearing his clothes.  You can't pack your clothes if you're wearing them.  That's true.  Walking out the door is also packing.  It's the same thing.  Are you going to pack?  Yeah.  I'm going to put the toothpaste in my pocket.  Bring a little knapsack.  A boy's knapsack with a milk thing in it.  All right, guys.  I'm ready for a 10-day excursion.  And then I don't know why I freak out so much, because I'll overpack. 
[00:38:30]  I'll wear, like, the same thing, more or less, the whole time I'm out there.  Yeah.  I mean, it won't smell or anything, but I'll have the same jeans for two or three days.  I'd change my underwear, all that bullshit.  You know, but...  And even wear some of the shirts if they're not smelling.  Really?  It's weird.  Yeah, I don't get it myself.  When I was in college, I had to do the same thing.  I had to study last minute and all that.  You know, I'd have weeks to prepare for a test, but I would wait for the day before and then do the all-nighter.  And then prepare that way for a test. 
[00:39:00]  Packing and travel and stuff, I'm like, I'm a maniac.  I have to be there on time, early, very early.  And then I sit around and wait, but at least I'm there.  Why do you say you're a maniac?  Like someone's going to go, wait a minute, you have neurosis surrounding something?  No one is surprised you're a maniac.  I know.  It would surprise me if you did it in a healthy fashion.  Yeah, leaving with the proper time.  Yeah, I leave a couple hours early.  I get packed the night before.  No, I leave 24 hours early.  Look at Anthony's been packed since June 8th.  Sitting in my seat, buckled up on the plane an hour. 
[00:39:30]  Sir, it's not your flight.  It's two weeks from now.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Can I get my bags out?  I'll just wait here.  All right, let's move on here.  A little eager fellow walking up to the gate.  Can I get on the aircraft now?  So eager.  Let's say hi to Joe in New Jersey.  Joe, what's up?  Hi, boys.  Hi, Joe.  What's on your mind?  Hey, today's my birthday, and it's an honor to share it with a little Jimmy, the little angel.  Oh, thank you, buddy.  Happy birthday. 
[00:40:00]  Thank you.  Hi, boo-boo.  What an ass.  It's not your birthday.  It is.  Well, today is your birthday.  We're so glad you came along.  Today is your birthday.  So we're singing you this song.  When you're older, when you're bigger, why?  I'm really growing a lot.  When you're older, when you're smarter, there's no telling where you'll stop.  Today is your birthday.  It's not his birthday.  It was so fucking weak ago.  We're singing you this song. 
[00:40:30]  Make a wish.  Shut up.  Shut up!  Stop blowing out candles.  It's not your birthday.  My wish didn't come true.  What was your wish?  Oh, my God.  This is the new pet battle thing.  That everybody would just run over and hug me for my birthday.  Oh.  Birthday hug.  Yeah.  That ain't going to happen.  My birthday wish that everybody would hug me, and Anthony would wave from across the console, 
[00:41:00]  from behind the plastic.  You know that birthday song?  I wish I was there when they were singing it, and recording it, just to stand in the middle  of all the participants, and just jerk off angrily.  Oh, my God.  Here comes the new pet battle bit.  Doug the Trucker.  What's up, Doug?  Has anybody ever told you guys you are absolutely becoming Oscar and Felix, the odd couple?  Yeah, we've heard that before. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, we can't...  Honestly, we can't relate to each other anymore.  That's a fact.  Aw.  Adam.  Anthony used to be...  Pet battle rules.  Anthony used to not really care about his appearance or anything, but now he takes it  very seriously.  I...  I...  I really don't.  I'm just...  Dude, you didn't even own a collared shirt when I first met you.  Now that's all you wear.  I...  I still have some t-shirts I wear around the house.  I sleep...  By the way, Jimmy, have you ever seen that shirt on him?  Yeah.  No.  Not at all.  Of course not. 
[00:42:00]  Of course not.  I've seen this one.  It has...  It's gray and white, and it has, like, palm trees on it.  Dude.  Your rotation is ridiculous.  I've never seen that shirt.  I think I saw that in an episode of Vegas once.  But I've never seen it on Anthony.  I think we've been back on the air almost, what?  What are we up to, boys and girls?  Nine months?  Nine months.  Yeah.  Wow.  I've worn ten different shirts.  Ten shirts in the rotation?  You have worn about a hundred.  I have quite a few shirts.  You've worn about a hundred different shirts. 
[00:42:30]  What can I say?  It's amazing.  Hey, do you want me to ask you?  Do you get your...  I do laundry.  I have a washer-dryer.  I do my own laundry.  But certain things I have dry-cleaned just because they last longer.  Like jeans because I wear them on stage every night.  Whatever.  Three days to get my clothes with this place.  Three days for dry-cleaning.  I bring them Monday morning.  I know we're flying tomorrow.  I'm like, I'll get them back by Monday, same day.  Just for jeans and a few...  Yeah.  ...shirts that I can't wash in my place. 
[00:43:00]  Three days I haven't gotten them.  Monday.  All day Monday.  All day Tuesday.  And it won't be here until like 7 o'clock tonight.  Who owns the place?  A guy like...  Named maybe Mike Mitchell?  Something like that?  Could that be his name?  Oh, wait.  No.  Jim Peterson.  Something like that?  Good last name.  No.  No?  Yeah.  Oh.  It's not our Asian friends who are the greatest.  They are the greatest at the laundry.  They do what they say they're going to do.  Yeah, got to love it.  This is a Spanish gentleman who's missing his lower teeth. 
[00:43:30]  Oh.  Jeepers.  It's got to be fun to go in and talk to him.  Probably from an angry customer.  Right?  Probably from somebody else that had a flight.  All right, let's get into this sex teacher thing.  Oh, you stop.  The sex teacher.  This lady rules.  Oh, boy.  42-year-old teacher banging the students.  Most of them 16 or 17 years old.  Yeah.  Married to a, what, a prominent business guy, dude? 
[00:44:00]  Banker.  Banker.  That's right.  Banker.  Investment banker.  Want to back up to yesterday because some of this, some of this, some of this text was very, very hot.  Oh, yeah.  Do you think being a banker is good at math and he does little equations like 17 plus 17 equals two guys fucking my wife?  Well, we talked about the one kid feeling a little vibration coming from the press box while I guess his friend was in there getting banged by the teacher, right? 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, and they were all chuckling outside.  The same friend describes one boy telling him with a big smile on his face that he just effed the teacher at, uh, how do they say in her name?  Geisel's house?  Eh, Geisel sounds good.  Geisel's house.  Another boy said he had sex with her later that night.  The 16-year-old told cops that in one encounter at a friend's house when he was present, two boys took turns having sex with Geisel and that at least one of them switched off with her three or four times. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, wow.  Another boy's statement says she gave her Conquest sex tips.  Mrs. Geisel was talking about what he needed to do better when he's with a girl.  She was also comparing the boy to her husband.  Really?  Oh, you think he just really sucked?  Jumped on, yeah.  Probably didn't, uh, didn't go down on her or anything.  Three-pump Johnny?  Yeah.  Oh, you see, guys, you gotta, you gotta, uh, give a little taste.  Uh, and then put, put her hand on his head and just pushed him down there. 
[00:45:30]  Shit.  Giving him some tips.  This story is so sexy.  Uh.  It's so hot.  In the May 15th encounter, the 16-year-old boy told cops he went to a party at Geisel's house where a drunk Geisel later arrived in a cab.  She started, uh, to talk to me in the garage.  She started rubbing my chest and just suddenly kissed me, the boy told police.  It's like Dean Wormer's wife pulling up to a Delta house.  All hammered and drunk, looking to get laid.  Uh, the boy later left but returned that night when Geisel called him. 
[00:46:00]  When Geisel's son spotted the boy at the house, Mrs. Geisel made up a story about why I was there, according to the boy.  What was the story?  I don't know.  So I guess, alright, she's a mother.  She told me that she knew it was wrong, but she had been, uh, she had been thinking about me for a while.  We then took off our clothes and had sex, the boy told cops.  Wow.  Geisel is estranged, uh, from her husband, top key bank executive, Thomas Geisel.  She was axed by the school after police and co-host caught her on June 11th romping with a 17-year-old boy inside a parked car. 
[00:46:30]  Romping.  How embarrassing for this guy.  I have to go to work.  Everybody knows your wife is being fucked by high school students.  Oh, how awful.  I'd almost take the wife who blows the toddler, like the ones who are banging the seven-year-olds.  Hey, I married a kook.  She is disturbed.  She is a nut.  This lady's not nuts.  She just wants some young football cock.  She's not a pedophile.  She's not a predator.  She just wants young cock. 
[00:47:00]  Right, and these guys want to deliver.  And they provide while the old banker in the bow tie goes and brings home the bacon.  Let's go to Josh in Oklahoma City.  Go ahead, Josh.  Dope.  Hey, I got a question real quick.  Yeah.  Is it gay if I'm jerking off right now listening to you two talk about the teacher?  Oh, not at all.  Oh, thank God, because I am jerking it like nobody's business.  As long as you're not yelling, lucky girl, lucky girl.  You guys take it easy. 
[00:47:30]  This is just a great story.  We got some audio I want to get to here, who she is and what she did.  Here's the audio.  42-year-old English teacher Sandra Beth Geisel was arraigned on charges that on at least two occasions she had sex with at least one underage male student.  Legally, it's a rape charge.  There are only two e-felonies, which only have a maximum term of imprisonment and one on the third to four.  Geisel spent last night in jail.  She faces two counts of third-degree rape and will apply for bail Tuesday morning. 
[00:48:00]  It's technically rape.  That's every kid's dream when they're that age.  16 and 17, there's no problem there.  There's no problem there.  It's every kid's dream for a guy, you know, a guy and then the woman.  That's just such a double standard because if it's a 16-year-old girl with a teacher, then it's like creepy.  Maybe, but, you know, if it's a...  Yeah, well, there wouldn't be like three 16-year-old girls lining up to fuck a 42-year-old teacher.  Yeah, I know.  But there's also this physical aspect.  It's less likely that a male teacher... 
[00:48:30]  It's less likely that a woman's going to force a young football player to stick his mule in her than a guy to force a young chick to assist.  Right.  After a February trip, students circulated photos showing Geisel in a scanty bikini standing with some of the teens in their bathing suits while she had her hand on their buttocks.  Jesus.  So she's drunk taking pictures.  Whatever happened to being in this street?  Her husband's probably like, honey, what is this?  I'm just having some fucking fun. 
[00:49:00]  Having some fun, asshole.  Yeah, that's what's coming out today, that she's an alcoholic.  I love it.  She's just an alcoholic.  Shows up drunk in a cab.  Hello, whore.  Falls out of the cab and says, I'm ready, boys.  She would show up on, I guess, field trips.  She'd go on these field trips, and the parents that were also there as chaperones would comment on how drunk she'd get on these field trips.  One time, the teens had to carry her back into the bus because she was so hammered. 
[00:49:30]  Come on, boys.  Who's going to fuck me?  That's probably when they got the handjob, though.  She was in a blackout.  She didn't know she was doing it.  She thought it was like those little beer tap things she was pulling.  Trying to get a little more out of it.  This is funny.  Nate's got a great line.  Nate in Brooklyn.  What's up, Nate?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Morning, Nate.  You know, the news did not even bother teasing this one.  Just getting back to the news tease.  No.  They just came right out and said it.  Hot, steamy, older woman on young child sex coming up after the break.  Yeah, they didn't have to make this story any more interesting. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  Very good, Nate.  Take care, guys.  All right.  Here's some more audio.  Geisel was fired in June from her teaching job at the Christian Brothers Academy in Albany  when police say they saw her having sex in a car with a 17-year-old student.  Since that's the age of consent, police did not file charges.  Where did they catch her doing it?  Hopefully not the school parking lot.  She's not that stupid, is she?  I guess it is the age of consent.  But when a 16-year-old came forward, Geisel was arrested. 
[00:50:30]  A local lawyer says emails he's received claim Geisel seduced at least four high school  juniors.  One incident allegedly in the school football field press box and all of them following  a Florida field trip on which Geisel reportedly provided alcohol to students and got very drunk  herself.  Very drunk.  Very drunk.  Who's the faggot that came forward?  The rat.  What a jerk-off.  He was probably falling in love with her.  I was jealous she was banging other guys.  Maybe.  Does it say who came forward? 
[00:51:00]  No, he's underage.  I'm a little fucking cock blocker.  Albany DA says additional charges of the plying minors with alcohol would be brought up on  her.  And both in New York and in Florida where the students had traveled.  An unsigned June 27 letter to the school board members from concerned parents accused Geisel  of becoming so irrepressibly intoxicated during the trip that she was unable to stand and 
[00:51:30]  four juniors had to carry her back to the hotel.  That was very helpful with the word.  I just liked what just happened there because you guys are both looking at it and then you  say so irrepressibly drunk.  Oh, yes, irrepressibly.  It was irrepressibly.  I actually knew that one.  It was just funny the way he came out.  It was like he said it and you're like, yes, irrepressibly. 
[00:52:00]  It almost looked like a cue on my thing.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, they had to carry her back to the hotel room all drunk.  You get four guys carrying her back.  I'm certain something happened there, too.  She isn't just going to go, put me on the bed, boys, and then leave.  Just a gangbang.  Prosecutors say they're lucky to have a case at all.  Our society probably precludes a lot of young men from reporting because it's been felt  that it's a conquest and not a victimization.  Of course.  There you go. 
[00:52:30]  Of course.  It is.  I'd love to find out who two-told and just slap his face repeatedly.  It's every guy's, well, not every guy's.  He might be dreaming of something else at 16, but it's almost every guy's dream at 16.  I still want to bang my French teacher from high school.  I had such a thing for her, and I always got vibes off her, which was probably just being  polite.  But, like, you see all this shit.  You're a French teacher, too?  Yeah, man.  I had a French teacher.  Oh.  She wore, like, low-cut stuff, lots of cleavage, big boobs, blonde. 
[00:53:00]  Talked in that French accent.  Oh, no, mine, completely conservative dress.  She was just nice to me.  Really?  No, ours dressed very sexy, and then people were always suspicious of what was going on  there.  Yeah, there was always the hot, young teacher in the school that everybody wanted to jump  on.  Then the old bags that made up the majority of the teaching staff.  Yeah, let's go to Boston.  I never had one of those teachers, though, that was, like, hot. 
[00:53:30]  Hot?  I thought it was hot.  I whacked my bag to every female teacher.  Every.  I had one, and I'm not kidding, she looked like a horse.  She was awful, and her ass was big, but not in a good way.  It was good, like, in a Dockers pants way.  It just, big.  She looked, I honestly got a body like Bruce Kelly, and I would still whack my bag to her.  You would?  All the time, because she was the teacher.  Oh, that whole.  No matter how awful a female teacher was.  Was it a farty thing? 
[00:54:00]  No, it was just dirty.  I would just find something sexy, because you're in class every day, and they're like,  you know what?  That ass isn't bad.  There it is.  Off to the races.  Weren't there girls around you that might have been cute?  Many.  I went to middle school right across the street from four houses in from where I lived, which  was a 30-second walk to my school.  I would go home on lunch, jerk off, go back to school, and then just feel guilty like  they could all see it.  Oh, because they could.  Probably.  I didn't shower a lot.  Why don't you wash your hair? 
[00:54:30]  It is washed.  I'll never forget Lynn Rosenberg saying that to me.  I had a crush on this girl in class, and Lynn goes, why don't you wash your hair?  And that was my answer.  It is washed.  It is washed.  And it wasn't.  It was washed in motor oil.  Oh, just real greasy.  Dude, I was filthy.  And she said that, and the girl right next to her, I had such a crush on her.  I was so embarrassed.  And then she tapped me again and goes, hey, why don't you?  And I just kicked her desk.  Just shut her up.  I almost assaulted her. 
[00:55:00]  Did you ever get Valentine's on Valentine's Day?  Remember how on Valentine's Day, the girls and boys would trade little heart-shaped cards  and stuff around the classroom?  No, I never got them.  You never got them?  No, I didn't.  Yeah.  Did you have the computer program?  No.  When you were in school for Valentine's Day?  This was before computers.  No, that's the weird part.  I mean, you know, we're older gentlemen, but I remember it was junior high or high school. 
[00:55:30]  They had some kind of whacked out computer program that gave you, you had to answer a  few questions.  And then like during fifth period, they're going to give you your top five matches of  all the girls in your grade.  Oh, really?  That made for...  That's good.  Computer dating at school.  That made for a really, really strange afternoon.  Oh, yeah.  And that was on Valentine's Day?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nah.  And it just made me more depressed because I lucked out and one of the hottest chicks  in my grade was on my list.  I'm like, yeah, like I'll ever have a show on her.  Like that'll happen. 
[00:56:00]  Right.  You know what my list said?  Put a cracker on your forehead and lay on the floor.  Let's say hi to Boston.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, guys.  That's birthday there, Jimmy.  Thank you, buddy.  You guys just addressed a little bit of what I was thinking.  It's, you know, what fuck actually paddled on this?  Like what kid ruined this situation?  Because I know when I was in high school, there was a sophomore teacher who we nicknamed 
[00:56:30]  her Cheez Whiz because, you know, the rumors were she had spread Cheez Whiz on herself and  let some football guys like eat her out.  And you're coming up through the ranks and you're getting into your freshman and you're  looking to get to be a sophomore so that you just hope you're in her class and you kind  of get that tap on the shoulder.  You know, you're hoping for that.  And now some kid just ruined it for everybody else in that high school.  I'm thinking that this kid got jealous.  Absolutely.  I think I'm thinking this kid got jealous because he thought it was a special thing 
[00:57:00]  between him and the teacher.  Yeah.  It wasn't.  He saw everyone else banging her and somehow he said something to somebody and that was  that.  He fell in love.  Oh, that's just bullshit.  That's the only thing I could think of unless maybe the alcoholic teacher's son got involved  somehow and maybe told his father who, I don't know, went to the authorities.  It's hard to keep that secret.  High school kids, forget about it.  Unless it's one guy.  Yeah.  Maybe one guy.  You got to think the whole school knew.  Everyone knew.  So it was all going around the hallways and that happens. 
[00:57:30]  Whoever ratted it to get cancer.  I bet you it made the female students dress a lot sexier.  Sexier.  How are they going to compete with her?  We had the one gym teacher who was like an ex-Golden Gloves boxer, black guy, handsome.  All the girls kind of liked him.  And everyone knew he had banging female students, but it was like one of those things where you  just couldn't prove it.  No one had specifics.  He'd come back with little white stuff on his mustache.  I mean, everybody knew.  Yeah. 
[00:58:00]  And eventually he did get busted for it.  What do you mean he came back with white stuff on his mustache?  Well, he was allegedly doing blow.  And a lot of people had said they would see stuff on the stash.  You know, he was a party guy.  Oh, I thought some of the girls had yeast infections.  No, no.  He had bread.  He had a bread crumb.  A bread stash.  No.  A little loaf on his tongue.  Let's go to Joe in Chicago.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Making Anthony's bagel in his mustache.  Go ahead, Joe.  Yeah, you guys were talking about there's pictures of her in a bikini with the guys.  Yeah, yeah.  You know there has to be some video circulating somewhere right now. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, you think video, too?  Maybe.  Well, I mean, so many video phones.  I mean, you know these kids are at the parties.  They've got to whip out their cell phones and start taking pictures and action shots and video of this.  And she's such a drunk, man.  She's a drunk, so she had to be passed out to the point where it was very easy to videotape her.  Oh, it's going to surface soon, and that's like the next, you know, reality.  Bloody porn video.  All right.  I've got to move on.  The phones have, like I like to say a million times, have exploded. 
[00:59:00]  Oh.  So we want to move through this as fast as possible here.  Let's go to Miami.  John, what's up?  Morning, boys.  How are you doing?  All right, John.  Listen, I used to get around with my babysitter.  I was like in fifth, sixth, and seventh grade.  She was like 16.  She was smoking.  One day we were watching TV, and I put on Playboy, and like, it was electric blue, and things got on from there, man.  But for like three years, I never told a soul.  I didn't want to ruin it.  Didn't tell my friends because I figured they ran on me.  It was a beautiful thing, man.  Three years.  Nice run. 
[00:59:30]  What finally happened?  Wait, but you were like 12 or 13, and she was 16, right?  I was a hairless little bitch, dude.  Yeah, but I guess that's a big age difference at that age, right?  Yeah.  I couldn't.  I never banged her, but she had to fucking suck my balls and everything, and it was a pitiful thing.  Never told a soul.  Gotta love satellite radio.  That's right.  All right, John.  Especially when she was babysitting.  That's a power thing.  Yeah, John, how did it end?  She just stopped babysitting.  My mom was like, you're old enough, man.  I was like, fuck.  No, I'm not.  I'm very irresponsible. 
[01:00:00]  18.  Mother, I'll be 35.  I'm scared.  I don't know if I can handle her real sisters.  I think I still need her.  She's like, now you're old enough.  I was like, fuck.  That had to be a really sad day.  Yeah, but thanks for good memories, but one more thing.  I shit you not, we played Strip Connect 4.  Jesus.  Strip Connect 4.  Whoever left Connect 4, the round, had to take a piece of clothing off.  You can't make that shit up, bro.  God damn it.  Very good, John.  My babysitter, one time I tried to make her laugh.  I took a slab of butter, and I threw it against the upper part of the wall, and we giggled about that. 
[01:00:30]  That's my babysitter story.  That's it, huh?  You're getting your little hairless balls licked, and I'm throwing butter for the yucks.  Hey, we got Dani.  She's a girl.  She's from Virginia.  Dani, what do you have today?  I was driving to work this morning, and I saw a wow sticker for the first time, and I wowed him.  You did?  I did.  Me and my tiny little pit.  Perfect.  And he honked his horn.  It was very cool.  Beautiful.  And you guys out there question if this is happening. 
[01:01:00]  Unsolicited.  Here's Dani.  She's wowing all over Virginia.  You have little bosoms?  I would love to wow more, but I never see any wow stickers.  And by the way, I'm totally in love with Jim Norton.  I'm sorry.  That's okay.  Hi.  Hi.  You got nice little boobs?  They're tiny, but yeah.  My boyfriend likes them a lot.  Tiny is nice.  There's nothing wrong with tiny.  Not at all.  Are the nipples big?  Well, they're not big, but they're not, like, non-existent either.  Yeah, perfect.  I have turned a corner.  I completely hate breast implants. 
[01:01:30]  Do you?  Completely.  Me too.  Completely.  Big, bad ripples on the side.  How are you supposed to titty fuck somebody when they got implants?  That's a good way to put it.  There you go.  If you don't have a wow bumper sticker, get that on the back of your car.  So, Dani, if you saw more wows out there, you'd be flashing, right?  Oh, God, yeah.  Totally.  Jimmy, are you coming to Virginia again?  It'll be a little wow.  We're doing this whole thing up here, so it'll be a while.  Will you let me know?  Yeah, of course.  Just email me, and I'll make sure I get back to you. 
[01:02:00]  Okay, well, I need your email address.  Yellowtreats at AOL.com.  Yellowtreats?  Yeah, T-R-E-A-T-S.  You can go off my website.  You can get it.  Okay.  There it goes.  All right.  Cool.  Thanks, guys.  Have a good one.  I'll chalk up another one for Jimmy.  Nah, she has a boyfriend.  She's in Virginia.  It'll never happen.  By the way, we still like to whack my bag.  We can pretty much take wow sightings all day long.  This thing does work.  It's like fishing.  We just don't waste as much time on it as we used to, because we're a very busy radio  show these days.  Very busy.  Self-addressed stamped envelope.  Send it to us here in New York City. 
[01:02:30]  We'll send out the wow stickers immediately.  That address is up on opianthony.com, okay?  Wow indeed works.  Let's go to Ray in Greensboro.  Ray, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  What about the dads, man?  What?  The dads of these kids are going to form some kind of support group, and it's going  to be dads only, and they're going to sit around and drink beer, smoke cigars, and share  the stories that their sons told them, so their moms won't know about it.  Anyone with this guy?  I know what he's saying.  He's kind of like being guy-oriented and silly. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, you know, you can't tell your wife, you know?  You can pat your son on the back, you know?  Right.  If your son's nailing the teacher, Jesus, that's great.  Yeah, the father wouldn't mind, I'm sure.  You can't tell your wife, you know?  And the guys are all going to, you know, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, Jimmy came on her face,  you know?  Man, what do you do as a father in that case?  Because it's like, you got to think.  That's my boy.  Yeah.  You think it's as easy as that?  Because he's, I mean, he feels some responsibility.  His kid's 16, probably figures the kid can't handle it.  It's got to be a little bit of a dilemma there. 
[01:03:30]  It all depends.  It's got to be really, really hot for the father thinking that, you know, thinking about wishing  that that happened to him when he was his son's age.  At 16, sometimes you're mature, physically, mentally, you know, you're a guy.  And sometimes at 16, you're still a little dweeby kid.  You know, if you have a kid that's a guy, that's growing into a man, then that's fine.  If you have a little 16-year-old that looks like he's 12 and still plays with little toys 
[01:04:00]  and stuff, then that might be a problem.  Then you'd probably be upset.  Let me ask you a question.  Listen, did you ever see a photo of me when I was in high school?  Yes, I think I did on your website.  It's atrocious.  You didn't like yourself much?  Who did?  Yeah.  At 16, I looked like I was 12.  Easily.  You still look like you're 12.  Blonde hair, you're slender.  Skateboard.  Skateboard.  Young Bucket.  I got to tell you, this is getting a little uncomfortable.  Why?  Dude, I'm not saying anything weird. 
[01:04:30]  Are you my friend?  It's getting a little uncomfortable.  Well, then don't sit like that.  How am I supposed to be all propped up on one elbow, trying to say, who are you, David  Cassidy in 1976?  How does a man not look?  David Cassidy.  Are you saying I have David Cassidy hair?  No, no, no.  Not the hair.  It's the way you're on one arm and your other arm is extended.  I can just picture your feet all splayed out, maybe on a bear skin rug.  I don't know.  I haven't thought this through.  Black bear skin rug with little white stripes on it.  This is a little uncomfortable, I must say.  For what?  If you had a nice car, I'd admire that.  You do.  It just happens to be your body.  Oh, my God. 
[01:05:00]  I can't even look at you anymore.  Let's say hi to Joe in Tulsa.  Joe.  Hey, how y'all doing?  Hey.  Hi, Joe.  Whose birthday is it?  Mine.  Well, it's mine, too.  Happy birthday.  Thank you.  That's not why you're calling.  It's not his birthday.  Not his birthday.  Yeah.  Hey, about the French teacher, when I was in high school, I had this dykey, lesbian, nasty  whore.  She was just atrocious, and I'd look around the room wondering, you know, which of the 
[01:05:30]  girls maybe she was muff diving with.  Then I got to college, and I had the hot blonde teacher, and there were always rumors about  her and the guys, and so then I'd look around and wonder who she might be nailing, but it  was a different thing, and I wished it was me, and it wasn't.  It sucked.  Wow, that could have been a really hot story, but...  Wow, I like your monotone delivery.  Instead, you took us to Dullsville.  And it was really hot.  Some people are just made to just listen to the show. 
[01:06:00]  Right.  I mean, let's be honest with each other.  There are people that just don't even need mouths.  Some people just don't need to participate.  Why'd you look at me?  Really check yourself, please, before you go on the show.  Listen and enjoy.  Really pay attention and see what you got and what it takes to call a radio show.  Right.  Jesus.  Let's say hi to Paul in South Carolina.  Paul, what's going on today?  Morning, boys.  Morning, Paul.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Paul.  Hey, I wanted to find out somebody's golden ticket status. 
[01:06:30]  I don't know if you remember the regular guys out of Atlanta.  The fuck-o list.  Okay.  I don't even have to think twice.  Fuck-os.  No kidding.  Now, one thing I do remember...  So, I mean, because you don't want to sound like hoo-hoo-hoo, but these guys follow the  Opie and Anthony playbook.  It was ridiculous.  Yeah.  They even got in trouble for doing the wiffle ball bat challenge.  Exactly.  No one was doing the wiffle ball bat thing.  You know, it's tough to go down this road because then you sound like hoo-hoo-hoo, but 
[01:07:00]  they even got in trouble for doing the bit.  We have the same agent.  Those guys were taking a look at foundrymusic.com every day.  That was their playbook.  That was their show prep.  I have no doubt in my mind.  Regular guys on the fuck-o list.  Got it.  Because before I started listening to you guys, that's all we had in Atlanta.  And when I started listening to you...  By the way, by the way, a little known fact about the regular guys.  Yeah.  Second choice for Atlanta.  Second choice.  Wow.  When we got fired from Boston, guess who was supposed to be in their slot? 
[01:07:30]  But we couldn't see living in Atlanta.  No offense to the people that live down there.  Interesting.  And then they had to go with the regular guys.  Yep.  Listening to you after listening to them, you guys sounded awful familiar, and now I know  why.  And by the way, those two guys hate each other.  Interesting.  Ah.  They tried to make it on their own.  They couldn't do it, so they had to re-team.  Yeah, I think...  They're on the fuck-o list.  Fair enough.  My personal fuck-o list.  Thanks, guys.  You guys suck. 
[01:08:00]  All right.  Add them to the list, boys.  Did you jot it down?  No.  Whackbag.com is keeping track of the whole fuck-o list.  Oh, good.  And people with potential to have a show on XM Satellite Radio.  A lot of confusion.  People think we're just going to blow up the channel and have a million shows on here.  That's not necessarily true, ladies and gentlemen.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jason in West Virginia.  Jason.  Hey.  Hey.  Good morning, boys.  Jimmy.  Hey, man.  Hi.  When I was in high school, my mom got remarried. 
[01:08:30]  Well, I later found out that my stepdad, and when he was in high school, he used to bang  one of his teachers.  Her lunch was...  They'd take lunch.  I'm a stuttering, muttering fuck right now.  Got it.  Wow.  You are awful.  You know what it is, sir?  You're scared.  I'm scared.  Anyway, her planning period was right after lunch, and they would go at lunch and take  her whole planning period at a hotel.  And they ended up getting caught because her husband followed her one day because she left 
[01:09:00]  every day and was never there.  He was a teacher at the school as well, so he took some personal time that day and followed  them.  Yeah.  So, that's my shitty story.  Did your father get a beating from the husband, or no?  No.  When they found out, they actually moved her to another school.  He was still a teacher there, so he ended up having to see him every day.  Oh.  That's good.  All right, sir.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to Jason in Tampa.  Jason, what's up?  Oh, I'd be, uh...  And I will be... 
[01:09:30]  Oh, hold on.  Open Anthony?  Yeah, what's up, Jason?  Hey, dude.  This is Cowhead.  We're live on the air in Tampa, Florida.  Hey, Cowhead.  How you doing?  Hopefully, you guys can feel my pain.  I know you're handing out the golden tickets.  I love this.  And I, too, work for the assholes at Infinity Broadcasting.  And you want to just get fired right now?  Dude, we're in hell.  Oh, it might as well be now before Friday, because it's coming.  I figured only you guys, because we're big fans of the show, and unlike other radio shows  that you guys talk to, we try very hard not to rip you guys off. 
[01:10:00]  Thank you, sir.  And we give credit all the time.  Are we really live in Tampa?  Yeah.  Lord of God.  Hello, Tampa.  Have you guys ever been on here besides VXM?  I don't think we ever made it down to Florida, right?  No, never in Florida.  Yeah, but can I tell you how many times you almost made it on the air here at Infinity in  Tampa?  I think they were trying to get us on that station, or one of them down there.  How many times have I been brought into a room, and they said, it's definitely going  to happen this time.  Talk radio, Tampa Bay.  I think Anthony are going to come on, and you'll go on middays right after them, and 
[01:10:30]  blah, blah, blah.  And I'm like, all right, great.  And you know how good Infinity is at keeping their promises?  Yeah.  Oh, of course.  I have a real problem with Orlando.  I love Tampa, but Orlando, O-Town, we have a real problem.  O-Town.  Oh, I get it.  Because of that jack-off Jim Phillips?  There's just a couple of jack-offs down there.  They're trying to make O-Town sound tough.  Just stop it.  It's Disney, it's Disney Town.  You can't be tough in O-Town.  Seriously, and Jim Phillips is 97, so don't worry about any of that.  No, we kicked his ass. 
[01:11:00]  He knows it.  He absolutely knows it at this point.  You guys got a great escort scene down in Tampa, too.  I've been there one time, actually a couple times down in Tampa, and Dennis, who owns the  Bunny Ranch, has a lot of connections in Tampa, and he hooked me up.  Really?  Yeah.  I've had some nice escorts down there, so.  Oh, this is Hooker Central down here.  Yeah.  It's a very dirty place.  I love it.  And girls love to make out with other girls here in Florida, because I'm from New York,  and that never happens there, and then you come here, and they just, like, you don't  even have to go drunk.  Where have you guys been?  That is happening everywhere.  They're doing that in junior high school now.  Not in Philly, they're not. 
[01:11:30]  That's the hottest thing going.  That's the hottest trend, girls making out with girls.  It doesn't matter what city you're in.  Yeah, all right.  My bad.  I was down there for the All-Star game.  You guys got a good arena.  Yeah, what?  The hockey All-Star game.  Yeah, that was like, that was when I wasn't doing radio.  I was just wandering around the country, and I made it down to Tampa, too.  Being friggin' rich and sitting home collecting money.  Yeah, well, what are you going to do?  Yeah, we'll be doing that in a couple of days, except not quite to the extent that you  were collecting.  Wait, are they booting you guys, or no?  Well, no.  They hired a new general manager here, who hasn't worked in radio in the last year, but yet, when 
[01:12:00]  he did, his specialty was starting Spanish stations.  You know the...  Oh, no kidding.  They bring him in, and I'm like, oh, Jesus.  So what I did was, I did my next day's show, I did a whole two hours of it in nothing but  Spanish.  And they brought me in the office and yelled at me and said, it's not going to happen,  it's not going to happen, and sure enough, now I'm here and it's happening.  Of course.  If the general manager specializes in Spanish programming, then bye-bye.  Also, the other thing in radio, we should give a little insight here. 
[01:12:30]  When they bring in a new general manager, they fire everybody, because the general manager  wants to bring in his own people.  Yeah.  And then they always give me that, don't worry, you guys will be fine.  I'm like, please.  I'm already taking most of my stuff home from this place.  Cowhead, I know the name.  Where did you work?  Because I worked for that faggot Eric Logan.  Oh, okay.  So you had to deal with those stupid haircuts, too, huh?  And he's probably wearing some gay-ass pink shirt with a silver tie right now.  With a little midget pants on.  Hey, Buster, that's our Elo you're talking about. 
[01:13:00]  That's right.  Only we can make fun of that disaster.  Have you been through his house and seen the fine Italy-imported furniture and just the  top-of-the-line stuff for Eric?  No.  I would love to know where this guy makes his money.  This guy has money.  Yeah?  This guy has some cash.  I think you guys are very funny, but nothing is funnier to me to hear you dig on Logan.  Oh, really?  Oh, just because I know.  I've been through it.  What kind of bits do you guys do?  No, we just, I mean, we do, we just get on and talk, and some days it's good, and some  days it sucks, I'll be honest with you.  You are ripping us off, then. 
[01:13:30]  Don't you have any bits that you like to go to, or what?  Like what?  Whip them out Wednesday, the assault on the media.  We can't do everything we do, either Howard says that he invented, so we try to stay away  from all that.  Yeah, how stupid is that at this point?  And that's another thing.  I love when you play the Howard Stern XM commercial.  Don't, Fred.  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  Talk on and on about how you invented radio. 
[01:14:00]  Don't, Fred.  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  We do this thing at the end of the show where we ask listeners what they learn.  That's something we invented.  Oh, that's a good one.  The what did I learn thing has exploded.  I can't even keep track of how many shows that do that now.  Yeah, and that's the thing.  We just, we try hard.  In the studio with us right now, we have, you know, like most TV shows have this gay guy  that comes in.  He's like a celebrity stylist gossip guy.  Okay.  So we got the faggiest of all fags, Mick Ferrari, comes in every Wednesday for an hour and dishes 
[01:14:30]  the dirt.  The notorious FHA, yeah.  Dishes the dirt.  And what's the big story today?  I don't know.  We didn't get to it yet.  We were just kind of BSing, we're on hold with you guys for two hours waiting for somebody  to pick up.  Well, listen, you know, we don't feel like doing a show today, so we'll just listen to  you guys.  We don't feel like doing a show.  Yeah, we'll just broadcast you guys all over the country today because you were cool enough  to call the show.  Well, that's the thing.  I said, listen, I hear a lot of these guys, you listen to their shows, and I figured,  oh, what's the worst they could do?  Rip on us for two hours?  I'll take it.  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:15:00]  Exactly.  Hey, do you guys have any guests today?  Because we're a big national talk show and we don't get guests on this program.  Listen, I don't want to insult anybody on your staff.  And especially Ben, because he's got the big hog from what I hear.  Yes, huge.  But you guys, it's amazing how lacking you are in guests.  And I've even told Logan that it's ridiculous for somebody as notorious in the business as  you people should be clamoring to be on the show.  And if you knew how much money we pay a professional booker, it would make you puke.  I can't buy it.  I do, and it does.  I got an 18-year-old intern in the other room that books more guests than you guys get. 
[01:15:30]  Really?  And that's not an insult to you.  Well, the reality is she has some kind of relationship with Howard, so I think we're  getting cock-blocked.  But no one wants to talk about that because, oh, we have a contract.  You can't say that.  Well, really?  Well, we're the guests.  Yeah, exactly.  No, we've actually had a good run of guests.  Are you guys talking about the sex teacher?  What, the one here?  Deborah LaFave?  No, we have another one up here.  Wait, you got your own sex teacher down there? 
[01:16:00]  The Fave, yeah.  Dude, we broke it.  We got the real hot one down here.  She's the real hot blonde one.  Oh, the one that looks like Christine Applegate.  Yeah, but with the kooky, crazy eyes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, she's really hot until you look her in the eyes and realize there's something going  on there.  No, we have Beth Geisel, this one in Albany.  She was at the Christian Brothers Academy.  I've been seeing her on TV all morning.  Yeah, she's been banging her students, about four of them, gangbang, she's drunk, all the features.  We bonded with Owen LaFave, the husband of Deborah, on this show.  He's been on a couple of times. 
[01:16:30]  Really?  And what's his take on the whole thing?  Oh, he just thinks she's an effing loon.  So what happens?  He picks up, you call him, and he just cries for ten minutes and can't get a word out,  then hangs up?  No.  How humiliating.  He's really not that.  He'll come on and be like, yeah, she's a kooky bitch.  I didn't know, you know?  What am I going to do?  She's hot, and I married her, and I ended up getting effed in the end, but it ain't my fault.  And when she left him, she took everything out of the house.  Homeboy had nothing.  He had no couches, anything.  We had to bring that guy furniture.  How old was the kid she was banging?  Fourteen.  Fourteen.  Wow. 
[01:17:00]  That's hot.  Did you ask the husband how big his mule is?  I asked him if he was able to get it up and all that.  If he was gay, he said no.  He said he could totally function just fine.  She is hot.  I mean, you could see why he probably went for it.  And then she turned out to be a nut like that.  Yeah, he's like, why does your breath always smell like Similac?  She's like, ah, no reason.  I went to school in Staten Island with a bunch of old nuns, so I would have been home whacking  off to that chick if she was my teacher.  Oh, dude, she's unbelievable. 
[01:17:30]  She was the sexiest of all of them, I think.  Yeah, oh, definitely.  How are you getting away with things like whacking off?  I don't know.  I'm going to get fired anyway, so I don't care.  Yeah, we cleaned it up for you guys.  We haven't cursed once yet.  I know.  I appreciate it.  We're on delay, but I don't care.  Do you like, when you hear satellite, do you guys like, I mean, eventually you like  being on commercial.  Do you want to get on satellite eventually just for the national exposure and also the  freedom?  Yes.  Yeah, I mean, it seems that that's going to be the future of radio, and it's guys like  you that are on that are setting that path now, you know what I mean?  In the next couple of years, I think it'll be huge. 
[01:18:00]  You do know you're talking to the pioneers of satellite radio.  Oh, I forgot you invented it.  Once again, ripping me off, Robin.  This is how delusional Howard Stern is.  You know, we signed a big deal with XM Satellite Radio.  We get national attention.  They did a piece on us, Super Bowl Sunday.  It was a whole big thing.  Howard, this is the future, and this is proving it by signing a high-profile talent like Opie  and Anthony.  Then Howard makes his announcement and makes believe we didn't go to satellite radio.  Yeah.  Who was buying that? 
[01:18:30]  He's the first.  Meanwhile, that douchebag sitting on an AM station here in Tampa that you can't hear five miles  from the radio station.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And congratulations on Ron and Fez, by the way.  Yeah, we love those guys.  And that was the first golden ticket.  We got four left.  This was their home market, the old-school Ron and Ron show.  Yeah.  If Tampa doesn't know, Ron and Fez will be on XM Satellite Radio in the very near future.  They tried to bring him on here a couple of times, the same time that I got the meeting  where I was going to be on the same station with you guys.  Yeah.  Ron and Fez were supposed to be on that station, too. 
[01:19:00]  Great.  Yeah, I remember taking those meetings, like, well, are you guys going to do it or not?  Yeah.  It got annoying after a while.  Tell me about it.  Try producing sweepers for three, four days, and all of a sudden they go, man, it ain't  going to happen.  We get a lot of mail from Florida, man.  It's a good market for, it's like a good state, especially parts like Tampa, Fort Lauderdale,  it's, you know, West Palm, well, you know, but we do pretty well doing that.  And we do know there's some cool people in O-Town.  Bring it on, brother.  O-Town.  I guess it was the monsters in the make-up-a-day part, whatever they are now. 
[01:19:30]  That's what that is.  A house full of rednecks.  And they said, you know, come down to O-Town and we'll show you who's tough or something.  O-Town.  We got the douche chills.  I hope you can still say douche chills on commercial radio.  It's just like, ugh.  Let me put it in perspective for you about the monsters.  Their leader, Russ Rollins, is also a professional wrestler.  Ah.  That's why he's tough, you see?  Yeah.  Tough guy.  That's why he's saying O-Town.  Well, I'm a professional gun owner, so it should be a good fight. 
[01:20:00]  Fake wrestler or guns, hmm.  Norton, how come you haven't been to the Tampa Improv since the last Comic Standing thing?  Well, I went down there for that one thing, and then I went down for a week.  But I drew very minimally there.  The only place in Florida I've had a draw, which was nice, was Fort Lauderdale.  And that was just from ONA again, because I think we're doing very well down there.  But I only went, I think we were off the air.  We had just come back on the air.  Eventually, I'll get back down there.  But it's going to take a little while to build up in all the markets we were never on.  It's an awesome improv here, and they bring in a lot of good guys. 
[01:20:30]  We'd definitely have you on if you came through.  We'd fill it up, man.  Because you guys are still there.  You know, you're talking about your boss, and you're saying douche chills and whacking off.  We're going to get fired.  Who cares?  We'll be there.  We'll be somewhere.  It may not be here, but we'll be somewhere.  Oh, you know what?  I forgot.  My partner just reminded me.  You guys had schnitt problems, too, didn't you?  Yeah, Todd schnitt, yeah.  God, you have no idea what that was like.  Well, that's one of the dudes from MJ and BJ, right?  Or something like that?  MJ, yeah.  What was it?  He's MJ in the morning and schnitt at night. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, okay.  He's in front of ELO's, too, I guess.  Two guys.  Wow.  He started trashing us.  You know what it is?  He's like a shock jock, and now he does political talk on the AM and then still does the morning  shock thing as much as he can?  He's not a shock jock.  He's a morning nut hut guy with a bell and the whistles and all that.  Oh, you call it a morning nut hut.  Nut hut.  And then he's an afternoon, and what he does, he leaves the nut hut at 10, and he reads four  papers, and then for two hours talks about what he read in the paper.  Genius. 
[01:21:30]  Hey, that's pretty funny, man.  So you guys have any guests today?  Today?  No.  What did we have yesterday?  Yesterday we had the Warren Brothers, Country Act.  Tomorrow we got a good one on the show.  I haven't even announced this yet.  Have you read the Mindy McCready story at all?  No.  She's a country artist who got beat up by her husband.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Tried to kill herself and all that.  Yeah.  The guy who beat her up is coming in the studio.  Nice.  Yeah.  That's the guy you want.  Absolutely.  Just get a picture holding his fist and kissing it.  All right, so we'll be. 
[01:22:00]  Like Tommy Hearns.  If they don't put an end to this bit, make sure you call us tomorrow so we can listen  in on that interview, because we're not going to get them.  Hey, no problem.  This is great, because this is the highlight of our show today, too.  Yeah, big time.  Well, what else are you doing on the show today?  Because we want to see what you guys are about before we possibly give you one of these golden  tickets.  Well, here's the problem we're having is that we're defeated, because we know that Friday  will most likely be our last day here.  Yeah.  So that we've, so today, in order to, it had no real air value, but in order to piss  people off, we just brought goats in the building and left them in the lobby, but crapping 
[01:22:30]  everywhere.  Nice.  It's not funny on the radio, but it works for us, you know what I'm saying?  And we got this guy on cable access named Dr. Connolly, who's this 82-year-old black  man who's a racist, and he says all white people should go to hell.  They're never getting into heaven because they're white, and he's absolutely insane.  And where is he now?  He is, he's, he's, we call him every once in a while.  We're the only white people that he likes, and basically we call him just because he  says the N-word about 500 times.  All right.  You got to like that.  What's his number?  We'll call him today. 
[01:23:00]  What's he do for a living?  These guys think I'm kidding.  Give me the fucking number.  He doesn't do anything.  He just hangs out, and he does this show on cable access, and like he's big with like  black people who are pissed off at him, and white stoner kids.  I like this guy already.  Can they hear it if I play this down the line to them?  Can they hear it?  Dr. Connolly, can you want me to hear it real quick?  Yeah.  I can hear some.  This is the dude?  No, but I'm not.  That's really low, bro.  It's really low, if you can hear us. 
[01:23:30]  I am a god.  There we go.  My heavenly father told me, and he said, Connolly, you not know me, you ain't God.  You are over white folks.  You know what I'm saying?  You are not no nigga.  You are God.  You are over the white folks.  That's just the beginning from Dr. Connolly.  All right.  Doctor.  Yeah, and he's not a doctor, but you have to call him Dr. Connolly, and if you ask him  what kind of doctor, he says, oh, I'm a doctor that keeps you well, keeps you informed,  you crazy white people.  Wow.  He's a something-er, but not a doctor. 
[01:24:00]  A doctor cook.  Your son is attempting to bring an outside doctor into this situation.  Doctor.  All right.  Well, here's the deal, guys.  Congratulations.  You're not on the fuck-o list.  All right.  Oh, shoot.  We can't say that on commercial radio.  Uh-oh.  Dump out.  Yeah, dump out.  Dump out.  Oh, there was an O at the end of it, Opie.  Sorry about that.  We're not on the F-O list.  Right.  The F-O list.  Sorry about that. 
[01:24:30]  I forgot we're on commercial radio, but yeah, we're making a list of people we just hate  in the business, and you guys aren't on that list, and we have a fine name for that list.  Yes.  All right.  If we make it to the medium douchebag list, we'll be happy.  You're on the potential golden ticket list.  Ticket list.  What's the name of the show?  It's the Cowhead and Brent Show.  All right.  Cowhead and Brent.  Sorry about the stupid Cowhead name, but just like Opie, I've been branded since a child.  Yeah, I know.  A lot of people think that's my radio name.  Unfortunately, I've had it since I was 12.  And every time you hear it, you cringe.  I just cringe.  I can't stand it anymore. 
[01:25:00]  When they tell Richard Lewis, we're bringing you to the Cowhead Show, you know he's thrilled  to be here.  You got Richard Lewis in?  He was in last week.  Oh, look at that.  Another guy we haven't gotten.  Comedian like Richard Lewis.  How was he?  Was he good?  He was great.  He was awesome.  And XM doesn't think there's a problem with the Booker.  No.  Why would there be?  No offense to you guys, but there's one market shows all over the country.  We're getting better guests than what's supposedly a huge national talk show.  I know XM and Eric have been doing this for a long time, but if I can, I'm just a 33-year-old 
[01:25:30]  douchebag from Florida, but your Booker sucks.  Yeah.  Hey, Cowhead, were you at when Al Dukes broke the foosball table?  You were there?  Yes, I was there.  Oh, you were there?  Do you know why that happened?  Why?  Did you get the whole story on that?  Because somebody had called him gay or made him kiss a guy?  Al was so drunk that they told him that he was going to make out with this girl, and  when he went, they blindfolded him.  When he went to make out, it turned out it was a dude.  And he was so mad, he flipped out, and he took Obie's foosball table and just... 
[01:26:00]  No, that was Anthony's.  Oh, yeah.  Anthony, sorry.  That's the beauty of that, because Anthony stays out of all that stuff, and he messed  with Anthony.  And then I had a deal with an Al Dukes, the likes of Al Dukes.  Just honoring people of Woodbridge.  And then I busted his pinball machine, still one of the most classic videos up on our website.  Yeah, it was very unpleasant.  Yeah, I heard.  I heard there were pieces everywhere.  Are you guys from the East Coast, up the East Coast here in New York?  I'm from the metropolis of Staten Island. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, that's what you did say.  Okay, cool.  Yeah, yeah.  And I'm from O-Town.  O-Town.  O-Town.  O-Town.  Bring it on, brother.  Bring it on, man.  You want to come down here to O-Town and take us on?  Stop it.  Fighting with It's a Small World, playing in the background.  Yeah.  Tough guy.  I got to say, the only time I ever dealt with the Monsters, I dealt with them one time,  and they were actually cool, and they actually were asked about O&A.  Hey, how are they guys?  They were very cool.  Well, the problem with these guys, and the problem in radio in general, there's not a lot of honest  guys out there, and the Monsters are like a schizo show. 
[01:27:00]  One day they like us, one day they give us support, the next day they hate us and want  to fight us.  It's like, make up your mind.  You're just afraid of Bubba Whoop-Ass Wilson.  Yeah, make up your mind.  What is it?  Do you like us?  Do you hate us?  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Then you got, you know, then they say how much we suck, and then by the end of the show,  they're like, well, they actually don't suck.  We kind of listen in when we can.  So it's like, what is it, guys?  You know?  And then you got Lex and Terry, those bitter ass.  Oh, Lex and Terry's show consists of nothing but two middle-aged jerk-offs talking about 
[01:27:30]  how they can solve people's problems.  Is it a guy and a girl's show?  It's two guys.  Two guys.  And they're actually, they run promos.  They're on this market that nobody even knows about, and they run promos that say, we're  problem solvers.  If you've got a problem, call the show, and that's all, that's the whole.  Problem solvers, huh?  We'd rather make problems here on this show.  It's a lot more fun to create.  My wife isn't doing anything.  Here's the answer.  Go in the toolbox and pick out the hammer.  Problem solved. 
[01:28:00]  Drive to dentist after.  Another show that's just a one-market sensation, that's all they are.  Yeah, the big Jacksonville.  Well, that's great, you know, because they were making fun of us and other people on satellite  radio like they're only hiring hacks.  It's like, I think we established ourselves in commercial radio.  I don't think people would call us hacks.  Absolutely.  And when you want to hear us play a fun game of guess what's on my iPod, you'll see that  we're certainly not.  Legendary, huge in Jacksonville, all eight white people that live there love them. 
[01:28:30]  Great music to listen to as you're being beaten down and robbed.  Great music.  Great improv.  Fat tits.  They're talk radio.  How do I suck?  And another dump, I'm sure.  Yeah, another dump.  I don't even know what you said.  Well, it's Cowhead and Brent, everyone.  They're on the list of potentials that we might give a golden ticket out to.  I appreciate you guys calling the show.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  And much success there on the XM. 
[01:29:00]  Thank you, guys.  XM satellite radio for everybody in Tampa.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Check us out.  Well, they don't care.  They'll let us do a commercial because they're getting fired Friday.  That's true.  Friday, they're going to start the Spanish music.  Whatever.  Great.  We just had a big discussion after the show yesterday.  We got a guy who works here that's a big old school Mets fan, and I told him that  I had heard a couple times on the show that Anthony's mother enjoyed the company  of some of the old school Mets.  That's what I get from the show.  I remember all the high points.  You're going to get a call from my stepfather. 
[01:29:30]  I heard you talking about Dave Kingman yesterday mid-sentence.  I thought, oh, did she bang him, too?  No.  Oh, my God.  Did not bang Dave Kingman.  Anthony's ready to move you over to the list on the left over here.  You've got to calm down a little bit.  We appreciate the time, and any time you want to bash Eric Logan, we'd be happy to talk  to you.  All right.  It's Cowhead and Brent, everyone.  Thanks, guys.  See you, guys.  There he goes.  Oh, there they go.  Hey, look at that.  They're not that bad.  Those fellows were very nice. 
[01:30:00]  I like that.  We were able to actually carry on a conversation with a couple of radio guys without having to  curse at them and call them nasty things.  Very good.  There you go.  We should do a little friendly attack on their show now for the rest of the day.  Oh, no.  No, leave them alone.  Leave them alone.  Just a friendly little attack.  I don't have their info in front of me, but maybe a friendly little attack.  Send some reconnaissance guys out there.  Why not? 
[01:30:30]  Oh, you guys are so nasty, man.  Come on.  The show's called Cowhead and Brent.  Just a friendly little attack.  Toll-free, 1-866-932-9250.  That's 1-866-932-9250.  Oh, you stink.  All right.  Just don't curse, because those guys were very cool.  If you're going to bust their balls, fine. 
[01:31:00]  But don't curse, because you don't want to wreck the show.  Just don't, because they'll probably go with it.  Yeah, they will go with it.  They're fine.  Honestly, it's a friendly attack.  Please, don't mess them up too much.  They are getting the boot Friday.  They're on commercial radio, so they're on delay, and you can't curse on their show.  They're really getting the boot Friday?  Sounds like it.  Yeah.  If you flip the Spanish language, you're done.  If you bring in a general manager, that's what they're known for.  The writing's on the wall.  I love showing my boots to introverted fat guys.  Whip them out Wednesday. 
[01:31:30]  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program on this fine Whip them out Wednesday.  Send a self-addressed stamped envelope in.  We'll send the WoW stickers out to you immediately.  The address is up on opianthony.com, as well as the latest assault on the media that Danny 
[01:32:00]  did this morning, because we do them too.  We don't just leave it up to you guys to promote the show on live TV.  We do a lot of them ourselves.  All right.  More teacher stuff before we move on, Anthony.  Yes.  What were you talking about?  There's a website, Rate My Teacher or something?  Yeah, RateMyTeacher.com, and I'm trying to see that lovely Beth Geisel, who was banging  her students, the latest of the teachers banging their students, and I'm looking at some of 
[01:32:30]  her reviews, but I've got to register, I guess, to see all the other ones, but you can see  a couple of them.  One says, more teachers could and should take a lesson from this remarkable woman, and that  was posted today, so I think that might feel a little goofy.  But here's her stats.  Out of five, I guess, being the maximum score, she gets a 4.5.  She's helpful. 
[01:33:00]  Her helpfulness is a 4.6.  Average easiness.  Very easy.  4.5.  Clarity, 4.5.  God, what do you got to do to get a five?  Really?  It's true, she's fucking guys on the football field.  Right.  Fives across the board.  She's passed out, gang-banging, and she only gets a 4.5.  Picky, picky, picky.  My God.  I'm seeing a lot of happy faces, though, on the ratings. 
[01:33:30]  She's doing very well in the ratings.  All right.  Let's say hi to Wet Chicken from Whack Bag.  Hey.  Happy birthday, shit dick.  Thank you.  Oops.  Hey, when I lived in Torrington, Connecticut, one of my fifth-grade teachers would stand  up there with her fat rolls and her bunts, picking her pussy.  She'd just take a couple digs once in a while.  We used to call her Miss Pussy Picker.  Of course you did.  It was brutal.  Very creative in school.  Yeah, because kids come up with the most creative names.  She's picking her pussy. 
[01:34:00]  What do you want to call her?  Miss Pussy Picker.  Hey.  Good one.  Good one.  What the fuck do you want?  It's okay.  You guys suck.  Thank you.  Let's go to Scott in Indiana.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, all you guys had to do was ask, man.  We can't even get through to that station down in Florida.  Oh, you can't get through to Cowhead and Brent?  Oh, no.  We've called probably 30 times, and it's busy, busy, busy.  It's a friendly assault going down today.  Oh, hey, it's friendly.  We're not going to kill them this time.  All right.  These guys are great.  How classic. 
[01:34:30]  This guy's in...  Hey, happy birthday, Flappy Tits.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, no.  The new Pat battle.  What?  Hey, I'm punching out.  No!  Have some cake.  Let's say hi to Adam in Maryland.  Adam.  Hey, what's up there, O&A?  What's up?  Hey, don't there, Lumpy Nuts.  Hey, I'd like to make a nomination for the golden ticket.  Okay.  The Big O and Duke show in Baltimore.  I mentioned them yesterday.  They're big fans of the show, but we don't really know what they do. 
[01:35:00]  We know they support us and talk about us on their own show, but we don't really know  what they do on their own.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're pretty good.  They're some younger guys.  I don't know.  They talk to a little bit of a younger crowd, but they're funny as hell.  So, and Chad Dukes loves Jimmy Norton.  He's wet the sack.  People aren't getting this, by the way.  We got five golden tickets.  We gave out the first one to Ron and Fez.  We're going to give out four more.  Most likely, we're going to give one to the faithful listeners, a program that they could  have as their own on the weekends. 
[01:35:30]  And now my email has exploded from people who, give a golden ticket to this show and  this show, and I don't know these shows, so why would we just give a golden ticket out?  You've got to send us samples.  And don't send us to a website where we have to go find audio ourselves.  Make it as easy as possible if you care about these guys.  All right.  I'll get on it.  I'll try to get that to you guys.  And make it short, because any audio clip sent to me that's more than, I don't know,  a couple minutes, I'm not listening to it.  It's just like email.  That's more than a paragraph.  I don't even read them anymore.  We don't have time.  What you do is you scroll real quick to the signature, and if it's a guy's name, you don't 
[01:36:00]  read it.  It's a long email with a chick at the end.  You do a quick word search, and if it says sloppy and slobber dribble down to balls, you  read it slowly.  All right.  If you get an email from Allison, then that's me.  Very good.  And Ben Togg is so big, he can hold two cups of coffee and a dozen donuts.  Nice.  Punch an owl.  All right.  Let's go to Freak Show.  The truck.  Ben came in with some important news.  We don't know if we can announce it.  What?  Nothing show related, of course, but just some important news about a DJ hiring. 
[01:36:30]  Our old friend, Nick Carter.  Very good.  Got a job here in New York City.  Congratulations to Nick Carter.  Very happy.  He's going to be at K-Rock, I think, right?  Oh, yeah?  I think so.  Yes.  Let's say hi to Freak Show, the trucker.  Freak Show.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, buddy.  I got through down there.  It took about 10 minutes to get through.  But, of course, was it Cowhead and Brent are alive and well on XM Satellite Radio.  They laughed at me, asked me if I was a trucker that hung up on me.  Oh, very nice.  Was that called live on the air, though? 
[01:37:00]  Yes, it was.  Oh, nice.  All right.  Good.  Let's go to Chris in Kansas.  Chris?  Yeah.  What's up?  Not much.  What are you guys up to?  Talking to you?  Hey, I just got through to Cowhead, man.  Them guys are eating it up.  Everybody's calling in, giving them props.  Oh, cool, man.  It was great.  Thank you, Chris.  Those are good guys.  Yeah, they are.  We're attacking their show friendly and also getting a nice assault on the media happening in Tampa.  Sure.  Because we're getting out the word that we're on satellite radio to the Tampa area. 
[01:37:30]  Let's say hey, well, or hi, Basket Case, Wack Bag.  What's up, Basket Case?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  This is going to roll fast.  Hey, Friday, I'm looking for advice from you guys.  Yeah.  Friday night, my sister-in-law overheard.  Here's part of a conversation my wife has about meeting a friend of hers, and it's not  your fault.  I got a child and a husband.  So I tell her I'm going out so she can't leave the house.  Tell her I'm going over to my brother's to watch a movie with him. 
[01:38:00]  She's like, you're not, I can't trust you.  That's not really what you're going to do.  Call me when you get there.  I did, but I had my other brother watch the house.  She's sitting on our street.  This Suburban pulls up about five minutes after I call the house.  Uh-oh.  Guy goes in.  Ten minutes later, all four of my brothers and I storm the house.  They're just sitting in the living room, and she swears this is just a friend from work  and nothing's going on. 
[01:38:30]  What do you guys think?  You attacked too soon, sir.  Yep.  You should have waited.  You should have waited for the penis to be in the vagina.  Right.  The penis must be in the vagina.  Then you would have had no doubt in your mind.  Yeah, I know.  We came in with camcorders and digital cameras blazing to catch him on the fucking couch.  Now, who is this guy?  Uh, it's a co-worker of hers.  She's a nurse at a nursing home, and he works with us.  And did he just look at you like, what are you tools doing?  No, he looked at us like he was afraid we were going to kill us. 
[01:39:00]  To kill us.  Like Ralph coming through the door.  Aha!  Come on out, Harvey!  This is the first time I've ever seen an Arab gentleman look white.  So what happened?  Nothing, right?  Uh, there's a confrontation.  The four of us screamed at him to get the fuck out of the house until he did, and the neighbors  called the state police.  He's just sitting there, right?  He's an Arab gentleman?  Oh, yes.  Ugh.  My wife's been talking for three months about converting to Islam.  You know they've been playing terrorists, right? 
[01:39:30]  Oh, no.  He lays down and she blows him.  Oh, no.  That old gag.  Or he puts a bomb in her box and it goes off.  Yeah.  Yeah, I kind of figured that out.  Had she ever talked about this guy?  More than four times a week?  No, talks about him?  Yeah, all the time.  His name's constantly coming up.  Constantly was coming up.  He's a fucking wife.  And did she ever say she was inviting this guy over?  He came over when our computer came from Dell and set it up for her. 
[01:40:00]  Uh-huh.  That's a little fishy.  It might be.  You might have caught it before anything actually ever happened.  They may have just been in the talking phase where, like, you kind of know there's a vibe  there or you think there is.  Or maybe she just likes him as a person and he's thinking, hey, I'm going to bang this chick.  I tried to tell her that she might think he's a friend, but there's no such thing as a guy  with a female friend.  It's very rare.  And how would she feel if you were, uh, if she was out and walked in and you had some  chick on the couch?  And I'm not supposed to hang out with my friends when their wives are around. 
[01:40:30]  That's if I'm supposed to fucking try to fuck them in front of her.  How long have you been married?  Maybe eight years in October.  Yeah, you can get the fuck out of there.  It's over, John.  Leave.  Leave.  It's over.  Leave.  My mom's already at my mom's.  It's over.  All right, Basket Case.  Good luck.  That's what I thought.  Thanks, Dad.  We're problem solvers.  Yeah.  We solve problems.  Let's go to Rookie, the trucker.  Rookie.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  How are you?  Hello, Jimmy.  Hey. 
[01:41:00]  Hey, I got down to the Cowhead and Brain Show.  Okay.  And, uh, little Jimmy Norton asked them why they didn't wish me a happy birthday.  You asked.  Yeah.  They said, oh, your birthday was three days ago and then they hung up on me.  Very good.  Thank you, Rookie.  I got nothing else, man.  I'm going to be punching out.  That's very funny.  Laura, the trucker.  Laura.  Hi.  Hi, Laura.  I have a lesbian teacher sex story.  Jesus.  We really don't want to take these today.  Yes, we do. 
[01:41:30]  Yes, we do.  I'm just afraid that you all want to be confused.  Hold on, Laura.  Hold on, Laura, before you tell your hot, steamy story.  Jimmy, is it your birthday today?  Yes.  Goodbye, Laura.  Is it your birthday today?  My birthday was July 19th.  Today is just an average day.  Of course.  My birthday has never been in August.  It's July 19th.  Very good.  What kind of faggot has an August birthday?  Not the kid.  All right, Laura, I think we have time for you today. 
[01:42:00]  It's a beautiful story.  So I'm just afraid that being guys, you won't get the sensuality of it.  We will.  I went to boarding school in the Midwest.  And I was a virgin.  Hot already.  Yes.  It was backdoor Catholic, Episcopalian boarding school.  And I loved my French class.  I mean, I loved the French language.  And my instructor, Mademoiselle Mattson, she thought that I had a real knack for the French 
[01:42:30]  language.  And she was actually like one of our resident advisors.  So she lived in the dorm.  And she thought I could go somewhere, you know, with being a French instructor.  So she thought that I needed some individual one-on-one time.  Yeah.  And the first time it happened, I went down to her apartment.  And it started with just her having lingering touches.  Not anywhere, you know.  Just those nice soft touches, little brushes.  Like she'd touch your elbow and say, like, look right here, but hold your elbow a little 
[01:43:00]  longer than she had to.  Exactly.  What's sexy.  Even on my hip, you know.  And the touch, it was soft, but it always lasted longer than it should have.  What did she look like?  Oh, she was hot.  We were both blondes.  Very hot.  And she was young.  That's why she was one of the resident advisors.  She was one of the young single teachers.  It was her first teaching job out of college.  How old were you, Lori? 
[01:43:30]  I had just turned 16.  Oh, my God.  Oh, she was.  And so I loved the French.  I wasn't necessarily sexually attracted to her because, you know, I hadn't been sexually  awakened yet, I don't think.  But I really loved French, and I loved my French class, and I loved the extra attention.  So I would keep going over to her apartment in the evening, and I probably did that about  a week and a half. 
[01:44:00]  And then she was, like, grabbed, actually grabbed by my hair, you know, softly grabbed me by the  hair and started kissing me.  And I liked it.  It felt good.  And my breasts were kind of small, but I have these nipples that, you know, they're always  at full attention.  And she started playing with my nipples and tugging on them just really gently.  And so we had sex, like, for half the school year. 
[01:44:30]  And she lived there.  So we could do it wherever.  We did it in the, because the dorm wasn't where the school was.  We'd do it in the classrooms on the weekends and outside.  We had a little ski hill at our school.  We'd do it outside.  And what, would you just go down on each other?  Yeah.  And, you know, she's, well, it turned out that I'm really a clit woman.  I don't know if that experience made me that way, but, like, you know, because I go both 
[01:45:00]  ways now, and I can't have, like, a vaginal orgasm.  Very rarely do I.  Clitoral orgasms are all the way for me.  And I don't know if I was that way or just that experience made me that way, because,  I mean, she would just slowly, like, lick my clit, you know, and then just, you know,  until I got, like, real wet, and then she'd get faster and faster. 
[01:45:30]  I had, I mean, I had my first orgasm with her, because I wasn't a masturbator or anything.  No, huh?  Jimmy.  Well, I didn't have to ruin it.  So, no, that's okay.  I wanted to ask, like, how long did you see her?  Just half the year?  Yeah, well, what happened was I found out that she was doing another girl.  Good.  Ah, and that made you really upset, right?  Well, it did, and you want to know why it made me upset?  Because the other girl I thought was really ugly and kind of sad.  And I couldn't understand how she could be attracted to the other girl and to me. 
[01:46:00]  How many years ago is this?  This was eight years ago.  And what finally ended it?  The fact that she was doing another girl.  Oh.  That really bothered me, that she was doing two of us students.  Hold on, hold on.  So what?  Jimmy, that just made it over to me.  Please, I need, I need the lights off.  Wait.  Holy shit.  No.  What?  It was so bad.  No, you know what happened?  You were telling a story, and I was, I just, I got excited and I tensed up and something 
[01:46:30]  snuck out.  Anthony's coming up and I will continue to eat my egg white sandwich.  Jimmy, Jimmy, Bart.  I didn't mean to, I just got excited.  So, what is she doing now?  She's still a teacher.  You know she's still eating that young pussy, you know that, right?  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sure she is.  I'm sure she is.  I went back to my five year, and I saw her at my five year. 
[01:47:00]  Did you say hello?  Yeah, I said hello.  I talked to her.  I mean, because after, after that, I mean, not, you know, unfortunately, French didn't  do much for my career.  I'm a trucker.  Actually.  You should have licked box better.  But I was going to say, it did wonders for my sex life, because I have, like, this real  uninhibited sex life.  And I grew up, you know, strictly religious girl.  Yeah.  And it just opened me up to just everything. 
[01:47:30]  How excited did you get when you knew you were going to get the call that day to have  a hot lesbian sex with your older teacher?  Well, she would actually approach me after class, like during the school day.  And say, today's the day?  Well, she would say, why don't you come over for some extra study tonight?  Oh, my God.  And you show up, would she have little outfits on?  Extra study.  Well, I wore a uniform, yeah.  But, I mean, what about her?  When she opened the door, did she have a little something on? 
[01:48:00]  No, she just wore regular clothes.  I mean, she didn't do, like, lingerie and all that for me, no.  Right.  But, you know, candles and the smell, you know, the incense or potpourri or whatever  was burning.  Did she have a nice vag?  Yes, she did.  And actually, you know, whenever you talk about, you know, like a big, meaty vag, that's what  hers was like.  Oh, my God.  It's hot.  Well, very good.  So, it always makes me think about her whenever you talk about big, meaty one. 
[01:48:30]  Yes, of course.  Big, juicy vages.  Well, then, well, I have one other one, but it's not a teacher one.  Who is it?  So, you know, because I've been in girl relationships and guy relationships.  But I was bartending, and this is when I was still in college.  That didn't last long.  I was bartending, and there was a younger girl, and I knew she wasn't old enough to drink,  but I was serving her.  And she walked into the bathroom, so I followed her into the bathroom, and I pushed her up 
[01:49:00]  against the wall, and she had really small tits and nice nipples, and I pushed her up  against the wall, and I started playing with her nipples and then sucking on her nipples  and kissing her.  That girl would not quit calling me.  So, I think I made her buy.  You are a good egg.  You're in.  You know, that story, that was the best birthday gift I ever could have gotten.  All right, Laura.  Very good. 
[01:49:30]  All right.  Ow!  Ow!  Thank you.  What happened there?  Thanks, Laura.  That was hot.  The meaty vagina, that young face of hers.  Ugh.  I got a full rod from that story.  That's a solid story.  So hot.  Janine Pirro, New York prosecutor on ABC.  Female teacher sleeping with students.  Yeah.  Travis TV.  Travis captured this.  Oh, he did?  Yes.  Very good.  Very good.  Talking about this phenomenon where female teachers are sleeping with the students there. 
[01:50:00]  Phenomenon.  Phenomenon.  I love that thing.  So, the question's asked, are these women pedophiles?  You know something?  The channel has to be changed.  I cannot watch these stupid Fox 5 Good Day New York people doing that dancing machine thing.  That's hilarious.  Oh, is that awful?  The woman has absolutely no rhythm or dancing skills.  It looks like she has to pee and she's having an epileptic fit at the same time. 
[01:50:30]  And the guy with his tie flapping around.  Oh, look, I'm dancing.  She danced like Adrian when she was falling in Rocky 2.  Just grabbing for a feed bag.  And if you're a guy and you're getting on that dancing thing, you obviously have jism dripping from the corners of your mouth.  There's no way any heterosexual guy is hopping up on that dance machine.  Oh, that's hilarious.  All right.  Here we go. 
[01:51:00]  Some radio.  Well, technically, a pedophile is someone who has an affection for or has sex with a child 13 or under.  But make no mistake that having sex with a 16-year-old is against the law.  It is statutory rape.  So even if the 16-year-old consents, it's still against the law.  Because as a society, we've said you were not capable of making that decision.  An adult should not be having sex with you.  And therefore, you testify as a victim.  That stems the rules. 
[01:51:30]  That's not bad, though.  She didn't say she was a pedophile.  She's like, look, that's the law.  Right.  That's fine.  So you could go out with a 14-year-old and not be a pedophile?  You say that so judgmentally.  You'd be surprised how many of them have good senses of humor.  Like a nice meal.  We just really hit it off.  Yeah.  Well, here's the question.  She likes apples, and I got a big dick. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, no one's beating that line today.  Very nice, Jimmy.  Okay.  Double standard for male-female teachers.  This is what we've been talking about off and on.  You look at a male teacher in this position, and a female, the male is going to hang.  Oh, yeah.  You look at the men, and it's like lock them up, chemically castrate them.  But with a woman, you say, well, maybe she needs a little therapy and attitude adjustment.  You know, it's not so bad.  And on the other hand, we give an attaboy to the teenage boys. 
[01:52:30]  It's society's prejudice that is not built into the law.  The law is gender neutral.  It doesn't recognize that or suggest that because we think it's not so bad with a boy that therefore we'll ignore it.  It's just as serious.  Well, in the eyes of the law.  The law has to say that.  It's not just as serious.  It is attaboy, though.  Good call.  She won't be doing as much time as a guy would be in that situation.  A little side thing.  Track three on this thing?  Yeah.  Who typed this up? 
[01:53:00]  Travis.  Lovable Travis.  Take no chance, Travis.  It says, women are preying on kids.  P-R-A-Y-I-N-G.  Ah.  Wait.  That's with the E.  So women are what?  Getting on their knees.  Yeah.  And I'm the world's worst speller ever.  And reciting prayers.  I really didn't know that.  You're S-T-U-P-E-D.  So women are preying on kids. 
[01:53:30]  Are they my home?  Right.  Our father full of...  Please, God, let him have a huge cup.  He's leaving.  Travis is...  Oh, look at him.  He doesn't know what to do.  He's all flustered.  He's walking to the mic and back to the door. 
[01:54:00]  And they're all laughing at him in the glass room.  Thank God.  I mean, he picks up the headphones.  Wait, what am I missing?  Nothing.  No, Nathaniel, I put the headphones back on.  And then Nathaniel goes into the headphones.  You're all set.  Oh, like, you're done.  You can leave now.  He's just upset because...  Nathaniel's barking out orders.  No, he doesn't have anything for today.  And me and Danny have the fart game.  So he's a little upset.  Oh, yeah.  The fart game is on the way.  A game called Who Farted?  Coming up on the show.  Gee, I wonder who that could be.  The answer is Jimmy, 80% of the time. 
[01:54:30]  I don't know.  I've got a few in there.  Oh, okay.  I know who won't be on the game.  Not one from Mr. Perfect.  If you want Anthony on the game, you have to play Guess Whose Dick Got Hard When A Fart  Wafted Over There.  Here we go.  The third track.  Women are preying on kids.  Well, I think some of them clearly put themselves in a position where they can prey on kids.  I mean, what we're hearing is that they're not just having sex with one.  It's two, three, four of them.  That certainly indicates kind of a serial behavior. 
[01:55:00]  Of course it does.  Yes.  And finally this.  Many of these women are immature.  Many of them feel attracted to young men.  But make no mistake, this is still illegal.  And their motivation is irrelevant.  It's against the law and it's morally indefensible.  Oh, no.  Can't be involved in something as illegal as fucking high school boys.  So this story is just exploding.  What a cold fish that prosecuting was. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, she's on TV all the time.  You hear her?  Janine Pirro.  She's a tough broad.  You don't want her sitting across from you ever.  Everyone reading the story is thinking there's something, at least something a little hot about it.  And she's just all, buy the book.  All business.  All iceberg on cliff.  So the space shuttle thing, was it successful?  I believe news just coming in, yes, they have successfully removed that little ceramic and cloth thingy between the tiles. 
[01:56:00]  What was it?  It's almost like an expansion joint or something.  You ever see on a sidewalk the two cement slabs and they put a little foamy thing in between it?  That's what that is.  It's kind of to plug up the gaps.  So why do we have to cut that out?  Because it was hanging out, like an inch and a half.  It was hanging out from the bottom.  The bottom takes a lot of heat.  And at that speed and the atmosphere, coming through the atmosphere, a lot of friction, something hanging out, even just a little bit, can build up a lot of heat. 
[01:56:30]  A lot more heat than the shuttle's rated for.  So it could burn through.  So they figure they get the guy out there, pull him out.  I wonder why he could just take him out and leave him out.  And why put him there in the first place?  You know what I learned?  A little dangerous.  Slow motion stinks.  What's that?  They were broadcasting them, fixing the shuttle, and it was just taking way too long because everything was just in super slow-mo.  No, that's how they move up there.  They're in space.  Very slow in space.  Super in space.  And then they're taking a hacksaw. 
[01:57:00]  They just took a hacksaw blade and some duct tape.  Yeah, they pretty much just duct taped the space shuttle back together.  That's great.  That's what you want to show the whole world.  That we're on top of things.  Roll a duct tape and an astronaut floating in slow motion.  Yeah, no, so we don't have a hacksaw blade, so we're just going to tour-rig this thing.  It was accurate because the transmission gets all messed up. 
[01:57:30]  It got a little crackly there, but I think I understand that.  That just hit me.  I was trying to figure out the reference, and then I realized it was a crackle.  All right.  Let's say hi to Barb.  Yeah?  Hey, Barb.  Yes?  You're on the radio.  Oh, hello there, Barb.  Hi.  How you doing, Barb?  Hi, Anthony.  Hello, Barb.  Hello, little Jimmy.  Barb.  How you doing?  Good. 
[01:58:00]  Good.  Hey, I wanted to see if you guys could hook me up with that other lady truck driver.  I got just what she needs.  What do you got there, Barb?  Oh, I got a fat pussy and a nice little clit.  Really?  Yes, I think she'd really enjoy it.  What I could do to her, I'm sure she would enjoy what I could do to her.  What would you do to her?  Let's get down and dirty today, Barb.  Yeah.  What would you do to her?  I would do anything that needed to be done.  Boring.  What would you do to her, Barb? 
[01:58:30]  Come on.  I would lick her from head to toe.  Yeah?  I would suck those nipples with her.  Yep.  Suck on her thighs.  Oh, yeah.  I would just do anything.  Would you eat her ass?  If I had to, yes.  If I had to.  It's not like a gunpoint.  Well, of course it would be.  It's a trucker.  It wouldn't have to be at a gunpoint.  If she said, hey, lick it, I'd be all over it.  Female trucker sitting on that seat for 10 states.  Oh, yeah.  And Barb's going to go right in there for the golden nugget. 
[01:59:00]  Dig in.  Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.  Hemorrhoids like Stonehenge.  Damn, get me on that.  Hey, wait.  You can send her a picture.  You can send her a picture of your pussy at yellowtrees at AOL.com.  She'd love to see it.  Yellowtrees at what?  AOL.com.  She'd love to see that fat puss.  Yeah, we pass all the pictures along to our listeners.  It's plastered all over the Internet.  Oh, you do?  Uh-huh.  Where?  You have pussies on the Internet?  Why?  What's your deal, Barb?  I'm into alternative lifestyle. 
[01:59:30]  And where is it posted?  Adultfriendfinder.com, swingernet.com.  There's a couple more, but I can't think of them.  And how would we find you?  Are you hooking up all over the road?  All over the...  Are you hooking up all over America when you're driving your truck?  Oh, honey, I only run Illinois.  I only run to Chicago every day.  Good old Chicago.  Yeah, I just run to Chicago every day.  Chicago.  Okay, babe. 
[02:00:00]  Chicago.  Oh, Jesus.  Three times a day.  I don't know how to search on this thing.  What's your name on it?  Which one is it, Ann?  Illinois Couple 3.  Illinois Couple 3.  Three.  Correct.  THR or the number?  The number.  All right.  As of the end of Illinois.  I didn't even try to spell it silly.  Oh.  I think Hawk is looking it up.  All right.  Hurry up, Hawk, for Pete's sake.  Is there any way we can look without being a member?  Oh, boy. 
[02:00:30]  Do you have to be a member to...  Well, you can go in, and you don't have to be a member.  Just set something up.  But if you want, you can send something to my email, and I can send you pictures.  Yellow treats.  A-L-L.  Be a good egg.  What do you have?  Couples seeking man?  Couples seeking couple?  What is it?  Couples seeking couples.  Couples seeking couples.  Uh-huh.  Couples seeking couples.  Two women?  Two.  Well, just couples seeking couples. 
[02:01:00]  Okay.  You'll see me on there.  There's three pictures I uploaded last night.  What do you look like?  Blonde hair, blue eyes.  I'm a fat ass.  How much you weigh there, Barb?  Uh, well, uh, you want my driver's license weight, or you want my actual?  Your actual weight.  200.  And how tall are you?  5'10".  That's not that bad.  That's not that bad.  All right.  No, I'm going, you know, I got my dad's tree.  Jesus Christ, there's 45,000 listings. 
[02:01:30]  Okay, but go to the one on Illinois and couple for couple.  Yeah, I did that.  And there's still a shitload.  Yeah, how old are you?  Me?  I'm 34.  All right, because it says ages here, too.  We're trying to find you.  Yeah, do 34 to 50, and I'll be in that range.  34 to 50.  All right, here we go.  Ooh.  34 to 50.  Uh.  Nah, we don't see you anywhere.  Oh, boy.

How are those radar detectors these days?  Uh, they're pretty good.  This one here is undetectable, unless you're stupid enough like me to pull into a scale house.  Put it on a dash.  I already got a fine for it. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, whoops.  All right, we're going to search out your picture.  If we find it, we'll talk about it.  You call back, okay?  Okay, and that's yellowtree.com?  No, yellowtreeats.  T-R-E-A-T-S.  Yellowtreeats.  Yellowtreeats.  As in tinkle, it's a yellowtreeat, but there's more of it, so it's yellowtreeats.  Okay, and I'll send you some pictures.  Thank you.  All right, very good.  Let's go to Janine in New York.  Janine, what's up?  Oh, yeah, hi.  Hi.  Hello?  You're on the radio, Janine.  Come on.  Oh, oh, oh.  Jimmy, this is Sports Girl. 
[02:03:00]  Sports Girl from?  From AOL.  I sent you some pictures the other day.  Oh, boy.  Wait, did I respond to them?  Yes, you did.  What did I say?  You said very sexy.  I said rate my wow.  Can you resend them?  Because I have, here's why I ask, because sometimes, a lot of times, you know, I know it's not a chick.  I get some silly ones, which are actually.  Yeah, that's what I kind of thought.  But I'm calling because I belong to the same chat room that she was talking about.  I've seen her on there.  Oh, really?  On that chat room. 
[02:03:30]  My screen name is WhyNot1970.  It's my husband and I.  Oh, okay.  And that lady that was just on, Barb, is she okay?  Oh, she's all right.  Yeah, okay.  What do you look like, sports girl?  Are you purdy?  Blonde and big, huge nipples.  I like that a lot.  You don't remember her picture, though.  The picture I sent you, I had my face blacked out.  You might have to resend.  Do you have nipple pictures?  Oh, yeah.  Well, make sure my email's almost full, so if it bounces back, just give it a little while. 
[02:04:00]  The website that she was talking about is pretty cool.  It's like whatever you're into, you can find somebody for something.  Also, we all get together just so Jimmy can get laid.  But I don't most times.  That is this radio show.  Don't let us fool you.  This is a huge dating service for Jim Norton.  But do you understand how it just doesn't usually pan out?  I understand.  Let's say how do I blow a national forum and screw it up?  Mike, what's up?  Zilch.  Yeah, hey.  I know that you guys have been talking about giving away golden tickets. 
[02:04:30]  I haven't heard you mention your buddy Weeds yet.  I'd love to hear him on XM.  I said it yesterday.  Hey, if we get Brother Weeds out of his contract, we would hire him at XM Satellite Radio tomorrow.  That'd be great.  He's at the top of the list of potential shows, my friend.  And Mike keeps talking because that's what he does because he doesn't listen.  That's what he does now.  Thank you, Mike.  All right, we'll take a break.  I got a tinkle, Opie.  We'll go to break with this thing.  Who's sending in phenomenal again?  Got to give these guys credit. 
[02:05:00]  Henchman.  Was it Henchman?  And by the way, Hench, did you get a whiff of that dump when you walked into the bathroom?  Holy shit.  That was awful.  It was Dirty Harry.  I walked in.  Yeah, Opie's tinkling in the stall.  Oh, he's running in here.  And I walked in and swarthy Harry is washing his little fingers.  Harry.  I took absolutely no dump in that bathroom.  When we walked in there, the smell in that bathroom was like cows were in there just shitting on the walls.  It was disgusting.  I'm going to protect Harry.  I think it was Mars.  Mars does have some...  If it's Mars, then this is the second time. 
[02:05:30]  That's what I'm saying.  I smelled a Mars dump once.  It was awful.  And it was very similar to that time.  Fucking Mars just eats like feta cheese wrapped in leaves.  Oh.  All right.  We're going to break with this.  We still have so much to do.  I don't like skinny Al Roker, by the way.  With his big fat head.  His head looks like a milk thud with glasses.  It's just this giant head.  His head is the perfect shape of an egg.  Yeah.  It's a perfect egg shape. 
[02:06:00]  Ugh.  All right.  Why don't we...  Well, all right.  Hold on.  Mark the trucker.  What's up?  Mark, what's up?  How we doing?  Pretty good, Mark.  Hey.  All right.  Speak.  Speak.  Yes.  I got a golden ticket nominee for you today.  All right.  Let's go.  You guys already got part of their work.  It's the Cape Review.  It's the spoof on Madden and Summerall.  Oh, yeah.  It's done by Drew and Mike out of Detroit.  They're on WRIF Radio in Detroit. 
[02:06:30]  We have that bit, Hawk, that we can play?  Yeah, a lot of people suggesting Drew and Mike don't know much about them, but I guess we're  playing one of their bits.  Yeah, you got their Cape Review by them.  They're pretty good.  They're pretty funny.  We're not supposed to give credit to other radio people when you play their bits on the  air.  Sorry.  That's not supposed to be done.  You're supposed to say, it's something we whipped up here at the station.  This one's, we made a prank phone call.  We just said butt plug through the whole thing.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, it's amazing.  We put out a CD called Dement World, and it was sent all over the country, and radio 
[02:07:00]  guys picked up on it and started playing the bits as their own.  Yeah, playing them as their own.  Why not?  It was amazing.  We got so many versions of butt plug where they're playing it and making believe that  these guys did it.  Yeah.  We should play some of those someday.  All right.  Put them on.  Thank you, Mark.  All right, thanks.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  All right, so Drew and Mike on the potential list.  This is one of the bits that we have played on our program.  Check it out.  It's coming to the Gay Channel. 
[02:07:30]  What is it?  It's the second annual male group orgy competition.  And he hits the hole right after Jesse opens it up.  Whittier Hall's John Madden and Pat Summerall.  And then everyone's kind of slopping around down there and grunting and groaning.  And, you know, you get mud and stuff flying and gang tackles and scrums and quagmires.  No fems, fats, or hairies.  Just the hunkiest gay studs in wild group action competition.  I like to pack that guy around, too. 
[02:08:00]  Don't get carried away, John.  There was all kinds of stuff flying around there.  It's male group sex to die for, as described by the best play-by-play team in the biz.  That was a late one.  That one didn't cover, didn't cover, didn't cover.  Finally, they threw it out of there.  Whoop.  I don't know where that one came from.  Look at that big old beaten lob.  Oh, what a meal those guys are having.  That look good.  That's a good group.  If you go nuts for tight butts...  You push, you push, you push...  Get Gay for View today!  You just rode him backwards. 
[02:08:30]  Just put him right on his back.  With Pat Summerall and John Madden.  That looked like it was the last shot out of the Roman candle.  The second annual male group orgy competition on Gay for View.  I like to pack that guy around, too.  Boy, yeah.  He's going to fire into his guy right here.  Call 1-800-HEY-CUTIE to order today.  It's crazy.  This is what it's all about. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, I love this.  Wow!  He chose 36 double D.  He chose 36 double D.  Shoving her breasts in everyone's face.  36 double D.  He chose 36 double D.  Oh, wow!  He just whooped her breasts out.  We'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll purse out.  She just will purse out anywhere.  With a mound, one day.  She'll flash it, she'll, she'll flash it.  Hey, I'm all for it.  She'll flash it. 
[02:09:30]  And there's boobs in your face.  I'm all for it.  With a mound, one day.  Nice and fresh.  Hey.  With a mound, one day.  This is what it's all about.  With a mound, one day.  Oh, I love this.  With a mound, one day.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  Whip them fuckers out. 
[02:10:00]  This is fantastic.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  That's why we call it.  Wow.  Talk about the boobies.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Take your ball.  Take it off now. 
[02:10:30]  Wow.  Wow.  We'll be right back. 
[02:11:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:11:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:12:00]  Last I checked, I don't think he has the show anymore, but he was on WRKO.  That was a while ago.  We dedicated one of his old bits to him, the Ozone midget sighting that we do from time  to time.  We love Ozone.  Always have.  One of the only guys, I think the only guy officially that's stood up for Anthony and I when we got  fired in Boston for saying the mayor died in a car accident.  Yep, for April Fool's Day.  He was the only one and the rest of those fuckos just sat there on their hands and said nothing. 
[02:12:30]  Didn't Ozone get the boot for saying something on the air?  Something about the Arabs?  Yeah, because then they, he's a really bright guy and they tried to turn him into a political  talk show host.  Yeah.  And he did a pretty good job.  And they teamed him up with a boar.  Yep.  You know, straight ahead political talk show type guy and he, he, um, he gave the show  a lot of, uh, a lot of energy and, uh, and, uh, I don't know, something went wrong.  He said something stupid, unfortunately.  Yeah, it was something about Arabs. 
[02:13:00]  You know, because you think when you do a radio show you actually have freedom to say  what you want.  No.  Even if it's outrageous and, uh, you quickly learn when you get fired and kicked out the  door with your little box of, uh, stuff from your office that, oh my God, I guess I  don't have true freedom on the radio.  No, you don't.  Because as soon as you say one dumb thing that gets, uh, a group in an uproar, you're  the first to go.  Well, there was starting to see a little backlash on that, which is nice.  Starting to see a little bit of it.  A lot more people coming to the table with this, uh, this, uh, profiling. 
[02:13:30]  Second politician or Republican?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Isn't that nice?  Isn't that nice?  All of a sudden he's on board saying, yeah, why waste time, uh, looking at people that we  know aren't committing these crimes, these bombings?  Why waste that time?  Why not look at the people we know are, are doing this?  And completely non-conservative Bloomberg.  Ah, no, racial profiling doesn't work.  Yeah, let's get the story out of the way before we get into it here.  Here's how it was reported on TV this morning.  Good.  Another lawmaker says random security searches on the subway are just a waste of time. 
[02:14:00]  This time it's a city councilman supporting the state assemblyman's plan for profiling.  Fox 5's Mark Joyella has those details.  They say it's time to stop doing random checks here in the subway, but rather to begin targeting  people based on how they look.  Subway searches started with a splash last month and a promise from police.  There's no racial profiling, but city councilman James Otto's not convinced.  He says potential terrorists do fit a profile, and that's who police should be pulling aside 
[02:14:30]  and searching.  I think it makes all the sense in the world, and if that is offensive to some people, if  that's insulting to some people, I'm sorry, but this is the world we live in.  This is New York City in 2005.  Otto's supporting new legislation proposed over the weekend by state assemblyman Dove Hyken  that would change state law and allow police to profile passengers.  That's an idea that Arab Americans say would certainly single them out for abuse.  Focus on the young men and women. 
[02:15:00]  That means me.  It means my 15-year-old brother coming home from high school, pretty much.  So it's going to be me being stopped with holding my bag in the train station.  She's got the backing of Mayor Bloomberg, who continues to oppose racial profiling.  He says not only is it not fair, he doesn't believe it works.  In Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, Mark Joyella, Fox 5 News.  Here's the mayor who is saying, now really get this.  He's saying racial profiling won't work, but he's saying we're making the subway safer by 
[02:15:30]  searching people.  He is saying that, right?  He's put the police down there to search people going into the subways, random searches.  How can he say that narrowing the focus on the people that are actually doing this isn't  going to work?  Then he should be saying the whole thing isn't working.  You're talking about a more efficient way of doing what he suggested, which is searching  people. 
[02:16:00]  Now you can focus on the people that are doing it and make it more efficient, but that won't  work.  So in essence, he's saying what he put in place to protect us isn't working.  It's what he said.  That's it.  You've got to look at the people.  Why is racial profiling such a bad word?  Why has it become this thing that's like discrimination?  And it's become a bad word, a racist word. 
[02:16:30]  Because racial profiling is only acceptable when it's helping you get into a college or  getting a college admission.  Then your race is very pertinent.  When it helps get you into the fire department.  Then your race is very pertinent.  Right.  Then it's very pertinent.  When it comes to catching you doing something wrong, then it's bad.  Then it's bad.  And I know that the argument is, well, catching you do something wrong is predicting behavior  based on, I don't care, call it what you want. 
[02:17:00]  It's not even predicting.  It's looking and searching the people that might be doing this.  That's it.  It's looking at the past record of people that have done this type of thing and searching  those types of people.  Can anybody out there, honestly, and I mean, don't try to be a lawyer technically.  Can anybody out there just honestly speaking say you feel the same level of comfort or nervousness  with three young Middle Eastern men as you do with three old women? 
[02:17:30]  Can you honestly, even if you're Middle Eastern, I mean, please, you're a target too.  You're an American if you're sitting here.  Believe me, they don't discriminate.  You could be a Muslim sitting there and be blown up as well.  Exactly.  But is there anybody there, anyone that can say that they feel more comfortable having  some old ladies search than three Middle Eastern men with the same level of fear?  Yeah.  Can you honestly say that?  Yes, I can.  I'm fine getting it.  You're a liar.  You're lying.  Shut up.  That's the lawyer part.  You're trying to play lawyer. 
[02:18:00]  You're trying to say the right things, but disingenuous because it's not based on what you  really feel.  Shouldn't we also point out that the mayor of New York City is a billionaire?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  He's not really riding subways.  Yeah, thanks a lot for it doesn't do anything.  Well, he rides the subway to work, but he's got guards with him.  Believe me, he's not getting onto a random subway car with a guy with a bag.  Car isn't looked at beforehand?  Of course it is.  Stop.  Yeah, excuse me.  The other people that are riding the subway would like profiling.  Believe me, they want profiling. 
[02:18:30]  You see a young Arab man walking toward the turnstile with a backpack.  You're not going to search him because seventh in line is the woman with the stroller, the  old lady, the businessman.  So you're going to let him go through as to not insult people and he might pulverize the  car?  That doesn't work.  That's what's not working.  And only when you're trying to stop what is going to be an assault or a murder, a murderous 
[02:19:00]  assault, not drugs, not armed robbery, no other crime other than the one where people  are fucking killing themselves with bombs strapped to them.  That's what we're talking about.  Preventing a murderous terrorism.  Not a 19-year-old black kid in a Mercedes Benz where, you know, most cops will look and  go, look, the guy's on 145th Street, he's probably a drug dealer.  Right.  That doesn't cut it.  No.  You know what I mean?  That's profiling can't come into play there because that's not a direct threat to a train  full of people. 
[02:19:30]  All right.  Let's go to Beach Bum.  Beach Bum.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Hey.  Hello?  Hi.  Yes, you're on.  Beach Bum.  Sometimes, hold on, guys.  I mean, we're a very interactive show.  Sometimes when we're getting serious and then the energy's like this, you got to jump right  in.  You can't slow down the show.  It kills us.  You could say hello, Jimmy.  Hello, Opie.  Anthony.  Don't wait for an answer.  Just say hello and go.  Other times, we're just fucking off and it's easy just to kind of go, hey, happy birthday,  Jimmy.  Thank you, Opie.  Get your point across. 
[02:20:00]  Congratulations, Opie.  You know, things like that.  Beach Bum?  My point is, get one of those politicians on the radio.  Yeah.  Damn.  I mean, they're elected officials.  You're going to give them some free air time.  You know, they'll jump at the chance.  They won't come on the air.  Ben emails these guys.  We ask them to, how about, we try to get the New York Civil Liberties Union on.  The woman, of course they won't come on.  Of course they won't come on.  Hey, they're out of the closet talking about their position.  You know, give it a chance. 
[02:20:30]  They won't come on.  Maybe they will.  We try to get the head of the movie theater on who won't play the aristocrats.  We always, behind the scenes, try to get these people on to at least, and we're pretty fair.  When Richard Huff came on, hold on, hold on.  That situation is a business.  When Richard Huff came on, that's not more than a business.  That's a personal ideology because the business is going to make money.  It's going to bring in money and they show violence.  It's just a personal thing.  Bringing in money is getting him reelected.  I bet you've got a better chance of getting him.  Anyway, out of here. 
[02:21:00]  All right, thank you.  Let's go to Dean in New Jersey, get the other side of this.  Dean, go ahead.  Hey, what's up, Opie, Anthony?  Hey.  Listen, I'm just listening here about the profiling, and you guys want to just search Arabs.  What if he's a Muslim and he's European?  You're going to let him go by anyway?  No, dude, we've addressed that.  Look, Chechnians, believe me, and they're not Arabic.  The Chechnians, we're not saying it's only this.  Absolutely, you have to play the odds.  What has happened in this country? 
[02:21:30]  You have to just, I mean, you have to search somebody, and of course it could be a white  guy or it could be this, but the odds are it's not going to be.  Right.  All the guys in London who did it are, I believe, Arabic men.  No, they're not, you dumbass.  They're Pakistani.  All right.  You see, I don't know that difference.  You know what I mean?  Pakistani-Arabic.  That's the problem.  It's ignorant people like you.  Ignorant.  It's not the problem.  Really?  I'm the problem?  Or maybe it's fucking Islam that's the problem.  I'm the problem?  That's really classic.  Come on.  Yeah, it's not classy? 
[02:22:00]  You don't attack a whole religion because of what?  A few people.  I'm not attacking the religion.  Yeah, a few people.  Yeah, a few people.  It's just only a couple of people.  Of course it is.  So let me ask you honestly.  Let me ask you honestly.  I'm not going to yell at you.  Do you honestly feel as threatened by three old ladies as you do, okay, say three Pakistani  men?  Why such an extreme example?  Yes or no?  What?  No.  Yes or no?  Honest.  Be honest.  She could have carried the wrong bag.  Yes.  You can honestly say that you feel three older women are as likely to commit active terrorism 
[02:22:30]  as three young.  And by the way, Middle Eastern Arabic, that's not being racist.  When you say something like, yeah, a bunch of Spanish guys, Dominicans will smack you  in the face if they're Dominican.  So that's not a racist thing.  There's no difference between any of them.  You know what I'm talking about.  This is Jim, right?  Yes.  I'm asking you honestly.  Do you honestly think that three older women are as likely to commit an act of terrorism?  I'm not going to answer that. 
[02:23:00]  That's not a good example, man.  Oh, it is too.  Why can't you be honest and answer the question?  Be honest.  They're searching old ladies instead of Arab men sometimes.  I'm honest.  No, no, no.  Answer the question first.  No, no.  You're right.  No.  You don't feel as...  Who do you think is more likely to commit an act of terrorism if you're playing the odds?  I don't know.  Any kind of zealot.  No, no.  Stop playing lawyer and be honest.  I'm asking for honesty.  I'm being honest with you.  Him evading this question and speaking... 
[02:23:30]  I'm not.  Dude, this is what...  This is what you...  You're evading the question.  It's a very forward question.  They're searching everybody.  I'm saying, do you think that three old ladies are as likely to commit an act of terrorism  in this country as three Middle Eastern men?  You're right.  They're not.  Okay.  That's what I'm saying.  Listen to me, Jim.  Over in Israel, they claim to have the best security in the world, right?  Nah.  All right?  And they dress like Hasidic Jews.  And they want to search every Hasidic Jew. 
[02:24:00]  And you know what?  They get blown up to bits every day.  So it doesn't work.  No one is saying it's only Arabs.  It's only...  I am saying that if you're doing a search in the subway, you have to search who you think...  Like, if there was...  Say there was a memo put out and say Crips or Bloods or whatever gang...  Or the Latin Kings.  Let's say the Latin Kings had been committing acts of terrorism all over.  And you were looking for Latin Kings that were going to commit terrorists.  Would you really, I mean, feel as comfortable searching old black women or young blonde guys? 
[02:24:30]  No.  You'd be looking for Latin guys in a certain age group.  Same with Crips, Bloods, Mafia.  Well, the whole thing is theory, Crumble.  Because if you think, a lot of Latin people look black.  And a lot of them look white.  So how do you know what's what?  Because most of us can look and tell.  I'm not saying the extreme example.  Let me finish.  I'm answering your question.  Dude, you're asking a question and I'm trying to answer it.  How can you tell?  Can you look at any one of those guys on September 11th and not tell? 
[02:25:00]  Of course not.  How about the London Bombers?  Every one of them looks pretty much like we figured they were going to look.  So how do all these examples that are proven true, everybody they've been arresting,  looks pretty much like you expect him to look?  You can't be honest, Dean.  You're not being honest.  Listen, I'm Arab, okay?  Okay.  And listen, I do not mind being searched.  If it guarantees my safety, I do not mind being searched.  Then where's the problem?  And if it's done respectfully and, yeah, absolutely. 
[02:25:30]  So what's the problem?  How come you left that word out, respectfully?  I know.  Yesterday we discussed it.  Jim's been saying that for a month now.  I made an absolute point of saying that it has to be done with dignity and not a false dignity,  not a feigned politeness, but it has to be done with a real respect to the fact that it's because the odds are you're searching an innocent person.  So it has to be done respectfully.  And I have been saying that since day one.  So if you listen to this show every day, you've heard that.  Yep. 
[02:26:00]  So there goes your argument right there.  I've said that because I believe it.  Just one more thing, Jim.  You're disgusting for eating that girl's ass, bro.  No, she was hot, dude.  How do you not do that?  He finally makes a valid point.  I'm a good egg.  All right, Dean.  Thank you.  Love you so, guys.  Bye.  All right.  Let's go to George in Colorado.  George.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  I've got a couple thoughts on this.  In some ways, I agree with that caller, but I'm going to throw a wrench into your argument.  Martini Steve is half Lebanese, half Italian, correct?  Yes. 
[02:26:30]  Do you realize that technically Martini Steve is considered an Arab?  Would you stop him?  No.  Here's what you're saying.  You're taking every example.  I'm not saying it's 100% accurate, dude.  He's not allowed in the subway without his muzzle and trainer, though.  Dude, by the way he looks, Steve might get stopped by the way he looks.  Okay, but here's the thing.  I was born in Lebanon.  Okay.  I am an American citizen.  I am 37 years old.  I've been in this country 36 years.  I am as white as you are, Jimmy.  Absolutely.  But I am an Arab.  But I am an Arab.  It doesn't matter. 
[02:27:00]  Don't you people get it?  We're not talking that this is 100% just search Arab and everything's going to be hunky-dory.  We're talking that look at the people on the planes on September 11th.  Look at the majority, 99%.  Did you realize that one bomber in London was Jamaican?  Okay.  One bomber.  Okay.  Wow.  You got us.  Okay.  We're talking.  There have been others like this.  All of the bombers in the Philippines.  We said that.  Oh, my God.  Dude, you're playing lawyer. 
[02:27:30]  We're being...  No, I'm not.  I'm being realistic.  We know that.  Sometimes the long shot comes in at the track, my friend.  Sometimes the long shot comes in.  But you know something?  A lot of times it's the favorite.  Hey, here's the other aspect to it, though.  Not all Catholic priests are pedophiles, but all pedophile priests are Catholics, so why  don't we profile Catholic priests?  You're completely right.  All right.  Thank you.  Yes.  Someone's saying it.  They should be profiled.  But they are, and why aren't they?  Because the church is a very powerful organization that has made a living out of covering up 
[02:28:00]  the disgusting behavior of these priests.  That's why.  So what makes the church any different from the ACLU wanting to protect Arabs?  I'll tell you.  Thank you.  The church is a disgrace for wanting to protect these people.  You're right.  And the ACLU for wanting to...  Dude, can I finish?  Dude, you ask a question, and I answer it, and you interrupt in the middle.  The difference is, it's equally disgraceful.  And as awful as the priests are, that's not an imminent threat to blow up a subway. 
[02:28:30]  Okay?  And they are disgraceful.  They're disgraceful.  I'm a Catholic.  I go to church every time I see...  I mean, I do not allow my priest to be alone with my child.  I agree.  You shouldn't.  And I have been told by various church members that I am wrong for profiling my priest.  No, I'm not.  You just made our point.  Exactly.  Well, but here's the thing, though.  There is not a single group out there, regardless of the religious position, that would agree with us that we should be profiling Catholic priests. 
[02:29:00]  Again, that's why I'm speaking honestly.  And first of all, a lot of people would agree.  They just wouldn't be honest enough to say they agree.  A lot of people, of course, they would agree.  They just wouldn't say it.  This is not about being a lawyer or about being slick.  It's just about telling the truth about the way you feel.  And you're right.  You should be profiling priests because their history of behavior has been abominable.  And I think there's a lot more people concerned right now with getting on a subway and being blown up than there are parents that are Catholic that are sending their kids off alone with a priest. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, that's a little more niche than anybody going to work in the morning.  And with that, let's take a listen to a Stephen Lynch song.  Deep in prayer, my cross to bear, I kneel upon the floor. 
[02:30:00]  Altar boy, altar boy, confess your sins to me. 
[02:30:30]  You will find the grace of God inside my rectory.  At Sunday Mass or Bible class, I catch him in my view.  So I close my eyes, but there he lies, spread eagle on the pew. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, when I see him in that frock, my conscience goes awry.  Altar boy, altar boy, altar boy, altar boy.  Altar boy, altar boy, is it gonna be heaven or hell?  You can play my organ all night long if you promise never to tell. 
[02:31:30]  Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.  I could dress him up like the pope and then I'd, oh dear God, the shame.  No, no, lead us not into temptation.  Deliver us from sin, we could pretend that he was Jesus Christ and I was Mary Magdalene. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, altar boy, altar boy, altar boy, confess your sins to me.  Yeah, you will find the grace of God inside my rectory.  Yeah, altar boy, altar boy, confess your sins to me.  You will find the grace of God inside my rectory. 
[02:32:30]  Oh man, that never gets old. 
[02:33:00]  Stephen Lynch on the Opie and Anthony show.  I can't find a bra that will holster my massive boodle asset.  I'm very proud of my big tech.  Thanks God for Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Whip Em Out Wednesday. 
[02:33:30]  All right, we're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  We just played a promo that's like a month old.  Just ignore that.  Jesus.  Ah, that's great, huh?  I was listening going.  Go ahead.  I was listening going, oh, Mythbusters are coming in?  That was the last time they were in the studio and that was a month ago.  Someday we'll have this all figured out. 
[02:34:00]  We were playing Stephen Lynch, the pre-song, because it fit in that spot, you know, and  Ben and Steve come running in here and do you want to take a break?  Yeah, I guess.  We'll take a short break.  I said, but get something done.  Give me an assault on the media promo or like the info about our L.A. trip.  Uh-huh.  Not just a promo that means nothing to most people.  And, well, they did a wow promo and then they did an assault promo that had nothing  to do with assault on the media that was a promo for our show that's well over a month  old.  And assault was spelt wrong in the system. 
[02:34:30]  And Steve comes like barging into the studio and goes, who's the soon-to-be-dead guy that  spelt assault wrong and put this in this folder and, oh, he was pissed.  We'll get this figured out someday, I guess.  We are going to L.A. tomorrow.  We're going to be broadcasting for the X Games on Friday in Los Angeles.  Friday.  What's that all about?  Los Angeles.  Like, where are we sitting?  Are we going to be right there?  We're at that arena.  Home Depot.  Yeah, the Home Depot arena.  We're broadcasting live 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. on the East Coast. 
[02:35:00]  Listen, for you lefties out there on the West Coast, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. will be live in  Los Angeles, West Coast time, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.  And it's going to be a lot of fun at the X Games.  All right.  Are we right by the action?  Oh, yeah.  Away.  Motocross pretty much flying right over our heads as we broadcast.  Oh, yeah.  What's going to be going on?  Oh, yeah.  I think some motocross and maybe some BMX biking and things like that.  Hopefully some long boards and some skateboards. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, well, why don't you give them a run for their money, Ope?  I'm thinking of jumping on the half pipe.  Why not?  Pair it up.  Do a little something-something on the half pipe for everybody.  Why not?  All right.  We can continue with this racial profiling thing.  Wait.  What is this?  Frank in Jersey.  What's up?  Hi.  I want to play Guess the Fart.  Oh, well.  Can I play and maybe win like a silly little prize?  We don't have prizes.  Is that something else I've asked for?  How about an XM rock to sit under? 
[02:36:00]  Well, we got those seat cushions, the XM seat cushions.  I'll pick one.  I don't even know what they are.  What are they called?  Seat cushions?  Yeah.  Little tampons.  Yeah.  I've asked for a box of prizes that we could just consistently go to when we want to play  our silly radio games.  But something else we're waiting for.  We'll work it out eventually.  I'll play for pride.  Or you could give me a seat cushion and sign it and I'll sell them on eBay and make a few  bucks. 
[02:36:30]  That's true.  Like six bucks.  That's true.  All right, sir.  I think we're just going to play the game amongst ourselves today.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Well, happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, man.  I love you, too.  Wasn't that attack on the media promo when we were giving away the Arthur Chan collectibles?  Yeah.  The shirts and stuff.  When was that?  I don't know.  I think he got fired.  How long ago was that that he got fired?  It was AEW, wasn't it?  I think he got fired.  Damn it.  You beat me to it.  Because you know why?  Because you went to set it up.  Well, I think he got fired. 
[02:37:00]  I just jumped in.  AEW, wasn't it?  You stole it.  No.  You punchline thief.  I didn't know where you were going.  I stopped my great line because Anthony had something to say.  So I started, stopped, and then you jumped in.  I didn't know you were going with that.  How do I know you were going with that?  I'm not a mind reader.  That's that hot teacher.  She's in her yellow, her orange prison guard.  When did Kurt Cobain get arrested?  She's in alcohol trouble cited in New York teacher's sex case.  I love her.  They got her being led away in her orange jail jumpsuit and her blonde hair. 
[02:37:30]  Nice.  Very hot.  You think she's fucking the guards between the bars?  Probably.  Where they back their ass up between the bars and the guard whips it out?  Demon guards with the nightsticks.  For that.  Sure.  Why not?  All right.  We're going to play Who Farted?  Where are the answers?  Oh, I see.  Oh, I see what they did here.  I see where they're going.  Oh, very, very clever guys.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Danny and Travis.  Why don't you explain the Who Farted game? 
[02:38:00]  It's a creation of Danny and Travis.  We had Travis TV.  We had Danny do the assault on the media.  We got him coming in now again.  And Nathaniel just standing in there, just doing nothing.  Barking out orders.  He had his killer olive joke the other day, though, so.  Yeah.  So what's this game about, guys?  Basically, it's a collection of farts. 
[02:38:30]  And I guess I figured the best way that this will work is we'll play the fart.  Mm-hmm.  And then you guys will have to guess who it is, and then we can play the answer.  Ah.  Okay.  And then we have the answer key.  Okay.  Yeah, I see that.  Very good.  Should we get Steve and the gang in here?  Sure.  Yeah, Steve is very angry right now, so I think he needs to have a little fun.  I'm pissed off.  Where's Martini, Steve?  What, Eric?  He's locked in his studio right now.  He's locked in his studio?  Getting to the bottom of something.  We're a bunch of crybabies, is what it comes down to.  Are you feeling better, Steve? 
[02:39:00]  There he is.  Uh-oh.  No.  I would like to cut the testicles off of the person who fucking screwed with my production stuff.  You're a scary dude, but we've never seen you, like, actually do anything.  He's like the Fonz.  Not, I mean, I don't mean work-wise.  I mean, like, as far as hurting somebody.  I think you need to hurt just one person so everyone knows you're making it.  I have hurt people in the past.  I just don't want to do it now.  Remember the Fonz?  Everyone was scared shit of the Fonz on Happy Days, and you never saw them lay a hand on anybody? 
[02:39:30]  Whenever Steve gets married, he just hits a jukebox and the music plays, and he tries to have sex with a couple of twins.  Cunningham.  Anger management.  By the way, Eric did some research for us, and the promo that ran was for our May 24th show.  May 24th.  I didn't even do that one.  That's why I was so shocked when I heard it.  Over two months ago.  Over two months.  Almost two and a half months ago.  Come on. 
[02:40:00]  I'm so glad it's still in there.  Hello, Mrs. C.  Hello, shortcake.  That's over two months.  I really think you need to, like, rip someone's Tesco out.  Just one so they can still reproduce.  Just to show people you mean business.  Okay.  All right.  But I'm not really angry at anybody in the room right now, so I have to...  I really need to find a target.  Don't look at Jimmy.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I love Jimmy.  It's a hot seat.  Yeah.  Jimmy gets scared as it is.  You don't need to look at it.  Oh, my God. 
[02:40:30]  Don't get scared.  I really don't need you tensing up and farting right now.  No.  Well, we're going to play the Who Farted game.  Thank God this is the unscented version.  I didn't do that.  I am not.  Wrong.  Yeah, why not?  I just don't see him lay a hand on anybody.  No, I never. 
[02:41:00]  There's Steve's leather-flaming jacket.  Yeah, Fonty was always a tough guy.  If someone started giving him shit at Arnold, he'd stand up, and everyone in the audience  would go, whoa.  And then the guy would back down.  All right, Fonz.  All right.  And then he'd sit back down.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Remember that guy I threw out at AEW?  You have seen me hit somebody.  I can't remember.  I don't remember seeing you.  No, you didn't throw him out.  He was getting out of line, and he said, look, you can sit on it. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Nerd.  Wait a minute.  I distinctly remember.  I think he was some guy who brought a couple girls in, and he was...  He, like, was trying to fraud something going on.  The guy with Joe Diamond.  Yeah, that guy.  Oh.  That guy.  You didn't hit him.  No.  You bodily, like, removed him.  You asked him to leave, and he left.  Picked him up by the scruff of his neck.  You did the same thing my grandmother's done.  You threw someone out.  Ushered out.  No, he was...  And stay out.  Get out, and it's chilly in here. 
[02:42:00]  All right.  Thank you for the Happy Days soundtrack.  Now, we don't need the entire song.  Maybe she'll let episodes one through four play.  How about stop on that one?  Relax, man.  Play it again.  I know.  Tom Bosley's fat face in the middle of that record.  I'm going to put my fist in it.  Joni and Chachi are about to get married.  Oh.  Short cake.  It just helps to separate the wounds a little bit better.  Drink your milk and eat your veggies.  Yes.  Oh, Mrs. C.  Didn't the Fonz start doing that crap? 
[02:42:30]  Oh, of course.  He was the tough guy.  In the first couple episodes, he didn't even have the leather jacket.  It was like a windbreaker.  And, yeah, he was kind of like the guy they went to for the advice.  Because they were all kids.  Fonzie was a well-rounded guy.  He'd just be sitting on his bike, and they'd ask him questions, and he was cool about it.  And then he just became a parody of what was supposed to be cool.  Ugh.  Mrs. C.  Stop.  And then what a bummer when you realize that Henry Winkler, who played the Fonz, was really a nerd in real life. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, just a short little Jewish man.  He was.  A lot of people admired the Fonz growing up, and then you see him on some of these interview shows.  You're like, oh, my God.  He's like the nerdiest dude.  Cunningham, get me my yarmulke.  All right.  Oh, Mrs. C., my mezuzah.  Oy vee.  I'm the chosen people. 
[02:43:30]  Wow.  Here we go.  I was doing Steve C. as a Jew as Fonz.  Wow.  It was awful.  Who farted?  Let's play who farted.  Yes, let's.  Your choices are Opie, Anthony.  Why?  Anthony's never farted.  I've never blasted one in here.  No, it can't be me.  See?  Would I be profiled?  But everyone knows.  Why profile me for this game?  It's true.  When you know it's not going to be me.  I should be able to go through the non-farting turnstile. 
[02:44:00]  Rick in New Jersey.  His comment is for both racial profiling and the game who farted.  Go ahead, Rich.  Yo, boys.  What's happening, men?  What's up?  Good sweetie coming out of my mouth here, Jimmy.  Happy birthday.  Thank you.  I thought if all those guys profiling or watching everything, they had a clothespin in their pocket.  Anybody who stinks where you got to put that over your nose.  They're criminal.  All those smelly mongrels we have out there.  He's still working it. 
[02:44:30]  He's trying and he keeps adding more to it.  Yeah, that stupid South Jersey accent.  Rich, don't you realize sometimes it's just one line will just get you over the top.  It's either going to work or it's not.  And the longer you dwell on it, the worse it gets for you.  If I went Rich in New Jersey and you just went, if you smell you're guilty, bam, you're out.  Good line.  You could go home for the day.  You know, Rich, as Alex Rieger once said, it's better to remain silent and be thought the fool than speak and remove all doubt.  Alex Rieger said that. 
[02:45:00]  Very good.  I remember that episode.  Fine episode where Louis meets the parents.  All right, here we go.  Hope we don't have to have a race for the can after dinner.  Here we go.  Who farted?  Okay.  We'll start with the first one.  Wait, that's all it is?  I think I know who that is.  Well, you know how easy that will be?  Because all you've got to do is find out whoever's laughing.  Whoever's laughing.  If you hear me laughing, it's...  That's a really good point.  Yeah.  If they didn't edit out the laughing, then it's going to be really... 
[02:45:30]  If I'm laughing, it's mine.  If you hear a fart and then jerking off sounds, it's hope.  No, these are really tightly edited.  Yeah.  Here's just the fart.  That was mine.  Here's the deal.  It'll be Martini Steven and Anthony playing who farted, okay?  Because Jimmy and I know our farts.  Really?  You know yours?  You think?  I know exactly whose fart that is.  Yes.  Okay.  Here it is again.  All right.  I'm saying Jimmy.  Yeah.  Yeah, I have to agree. 
[02:46:00]  I think that's Jimmy.  Jimmy.  All right, hold on.  They're playing the odds.  No, I'm not playing the odds.  I'll be honest.  It just sounds like it came from a short film.  And Ope has really come to the table recently.  Thank you.  I usually fart when we have to record the crap for the 6 a.m.  That's true.  We might give a golden ticket out to the listeners in general, by the way.  That would be nice.  Someone made a parody song about Jim saying phenomenal all the time during one of his OzFest interviews.  But did they, um...  That's what I say to that.  Goddamn.  And we have the fart in context. 
[02:46:30]  I like it.  All right.  That's great.  I love this game.  I thought that was the next one, and I'm like, that was very poorly edited.  No.  Oh, good job.  You played the actual clip.  Ant and Steve both got that one right.  Very good.  You can play along at home, by the way.  I'm playing.  I'm all late.  Let me see.  You got it?  Yeah.  There it is.  That one.  That's right.  He farts into the mouth of every contestant.  Old Richard Dawson.  All right.  Here we go.  Here's the next fart. 
[02:47:00]  Who farted?  This is Danny and Travis.  No, not farting, but came up with a game.  Right?  I absolutely know.  That is Opie.  Absolutely.  Wow.  That is Opie fart.  Here's the fart again.  Oh, man.  Jesus Christ.  I can picture those baggy jeans.  Yeah.  Jeez.  There was like clothing reverberation in there.  It sounds like it's coming through a bag full of wet puppies, doesn't it?  It's just like... 
[02:47:30]  Here it is.  Oh, God.  Someone put their hand over it.  You've got to make a fart promo, man.  I'm working on it now, actually.  All right.  So what do you think, Steve?  I think that's you.  All right.  I think that's you.  Absolutely.  Let's see you.  Bravo.  There you have it.  Bombs and flubs.  Very good, Nathaniel.  Bombs, flubs, and...  Jimmy!  How do you talk on that microphone after blowing ass on you?  How do you not?  It's not wonderful. 
[02:48:00]  Wow.  What happened?  Me too.  Damn it.  You wearing a diaper that day?  Wow.  I assumed it was all of Opie's clothing.  The thing is, is my farts come in every way, shape.  My farts are really like a diversity.  There's a variety to your farts.  That was so muffled.  It really did.  I really thought it was me, too.  I got fooled.  Wow.  Like, some of them are, like, really loud and awful.  They all have, like, a different vibe to them.  Like, sometimes I like this.  No. 
[02:48:30]  Mark that down for the next time we play farts.  That's like...  Who farted?  That's almost like something squared.  When you fart while playing the fart game...  It's fine.  It's fine.  It doesn't smelly, but it does.  Stop it.  Of course it doesn't.  I can bite that one.  Stinks.  Nice.  All right.  Very good.  Smells like cheese doodles wrapped in placenta.  So here we go.  Ant and Steve are tied in the Who Farted game.  Oh!  Jimmy! 
[02:49:00]  So you're giving away the answer.  Jesus!  That is really terrible.  No, it's not.  It's cute.  Oh, it's awful.  It's a birthday cake.  Here we go.  Here's the next fart, okay?  All right.  Are you ready for the next one?  All right.  All right.  That one I'm saying is Opie.  That's Opie.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Here it is again.  Here it is again.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  That's another muffled one, which now the last one threw me because that was... 
[02:49:30]  Hmm.  I don't...  Yeah, it is.  It doesn't sound as wet.  Anthony?  I will say Opie Fart.  Steve?  Are you playing these in order on the CD?  No comment.  Damn it.  Because...  All right.  I'm going to say it's Opie.  I'm going to say it's you.  Hey, I was a 911 dispatcher for seven and a half years, and that call, the way she's  talking and everything, for inner city, what have you, is very typical of the way they 
[02:50:00]  call and the way a dispatcher would handle it.  Oh, okay.  Who was that?  Is that one without an amp?  I'm sorry.  That would be Opie.  Ah.  Nice.  You got it.  Yeah.  Still tied, Anthony and Steve.  Because yours have that little bubble thing.  Like, sometimes mine will be like...  Come on, dude.  Don't spray it on me, stupid.  Maybe it'll leak through into your fucking pores. 
[02:50:30]  Jesus.  Fucking Eric just panics.  Sorry, it's that little package.  You can suck it out.  Goddamn.  Jimmy's going fart for fart with the game.  I'm trying to show you guys that's variety.  One sounds like this, the other one sounds like that.  That was like a little Asian one.  You got nailed with the spray immediately.  Oh, Steve's got to leave.  It's fine.  He's puking.  No, I didn't. 
[02:51:00]  Yes.  I just sprayed Lysol and walked into a cloud of it.  Saturday, what a day.  Moving all week with you.  You almost sounded like Stewie there from family.  All right, you guys ready for the next fart?  No.  Sure.  There we go.  Let me hear it again.  All right.  I know exactly who that is.  All right.  Let's Steve go first this time.  Just based on the last two, I'm saying that's Jimmy. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, I must concur.  Do you know what that one sounds like?  Can you play that one more time?  Sure.  Hold on a minute.  It'll take a second.  Can you picture a cancer patient laying on his side with atrophied legs?  That's what that one sounds like.  Listen.  It sounds like a cancer patient.  Listen.  Oh, we love you, pop-pop.  All right, so whose fart is that? 
[02:52:00]  We'll go back to Anthony.  I agree there with Steve.  Yeah, it's Jimmy.  All right, here we go.  Uh-oh.  That'll work.  Oh, no.  What's the matter?  I get scared of my birthday. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, you're a little nervous?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, boy.  He's scared.  What happened, Jimmy?  I just thought of all my presents that were piling up, and I got frightened.  I hope people come to my party.  That one sounded like one of mine.  Yeah, it sounded kind of wet.  Yeah, you usually don't have it.  With a hint of millionaire.  And we're back live again.  You got it!  Oh, man. 
[02:53:00]  That was the commentary after the fart that day.  Obviously, we're back live, and you guys both got that right.  It's hard to pick them out based on tonality, but that one, just based on the last two, Jimmy ripped in here.  It's still tied.  3-3 for Steve and Anthony.  Oh, here's the next fart as we play Who Farted.  Easy.  Wow.  That was like singing.  Baritone.  Yeah. 
[02:53:30]  Wow, that hit some tattered pitch.  All right.  Play that sound again.  Oh, here's the next fart. 
[02:54:00]  Wow.  That's great.  All right, it's back to Steve.  Whose fart is that?  That's yours, man.  That is definitely Opie.  Again, yes, Steve.  I have to agree with Steve.  Absolutely.  That is a magnificent pitch you hit there.  Definitely Opie.  Oh, hi, Anthony. 
[02:54:30]  Hello.  How are you?  I'm fine.  Oh, no.  Oh.  That was a nice one.  Oh.  Very nice.  Fucking disgusting people.  It makes me happy, because I know the next segment makes me a little sad.  There you go.  You got it.  No, I did.  I went.  You guys both got that one right as well.  Let's go to Ken the Trucker.  Ken?  See you, man.  What's up, Ken?  No, I can't.  That's okay. 
[02:55:00]  Oh.  I was going to say, man, I love your show, but the fart game sucks, man.  But I got to admit, I cracked my ass up when you started playing that fucking music from  that damn movie.  How can you say the fart game sucks?  It rules.  Oh, my goodness.  Yeah.  I love you, Jimmy.  Thank you.  I'll tell you what, though.  I'll tell you, like I said, man, it's...  All right.  You're wrecking our buzz today.  It really sucked.  I was really boring as hell, but I had to...  He doesn't like it?  How do you not like the...  What kind of guy are you?  It's got mystique.  It's got farts.  It's got sex appeal.  Sex.  You can play along at home.  Right.  Of course.  Try to figure out whose fart it is. 
[02:55:30]  Please.  Whenever it's opi's, you don't picture those little blonde wispy cheeks opening up and  a gift coming out of them?  Oh, Jesus.  You're really making me uncomfortable.  I want to hold that guy down and open his mouth and go, how boring is this?  Come on.  That's what I say to you.  Don't spray that.  You take away the joy.  I try to give something to the woman.  Nobody appreciates it.  That is terrible.  Jesus.  In grace.  All you.  Place smells like shit and flowers. 
[02:56:00]  I know.  All the Lysol.  All right.  You ready for the next fart?  Whenever I get angry, it just comes out like that.  You're confusing everybody with the game here.  We're trying to play a game.  You're adding new farts to the equation.  Here's the next fart as far as our contest goes.  Cool.  You know right away, Steve?  I think I know.  I'm going to have to hear it again.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  I think I know.  Yeah.  I will say opi. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  I'm going to say for the same reason for the last one.  It's got tonality.  It sounds like a tuba.  It sounds like a musical instrument of some kind.  It's the same fart.  It's obviously right.  It's got to be opi.  My colon is kind of like Jack.  It's just pretty much whatever you want.  It's like an iPod.  My asshole.  Right.  And I'm just playing grunge songs.  That's all I got.  He's got a format that has to be adhered to.  You have a playlist.  His ass has a playlist.  Here we go.  Here's the answer.  Coming up. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah.  What do you think the problem was?  Richie was a huge star on our radio show on regular radio.  Huge.  I can't get up in the morning.  Oh, jeez.  Tweak.  Oh.  All right.  We're back live.  I think it was Jimmy.  You got the key?  Yeah.  That was Jimmy.  Oh.  Wow.  I told you.  I do impressions.  That was a hard one.  You do impressions even out your ass.  Yeah.  That was an impression of Opie's fart because I had the same.  Wow.  All right.  I totally missed the shit. 
[02:57:30]  And by the way, say tonality again and I'm selling this cup into your chin.  Tonality.  It is tonality.  You guys are still tied at four as we play the next fart.  Oh.  Hmm.  Ooh.  Oh.  Oh.  That kind of.  Oh.  Oh.  Before you guess, someone has a great idea.  I don't know if we can make this happen.  Long Star Viking the trucker. 
[02:58:00]  What's up?  Hey.  You don't need to have a fart line like you have the FU line.  Ooh.  Can we have a separate fart line or maybe we could, maybe for a while we could turn the  FU line into FUs plus farts?  Maybe that's the way to go?  Wow.  That's not a bad idea.  Yeah.  Because we already have a line set up.  The FU line, if you're leaving your FUs, what is the number for the FU line, Steve?  866-FU-LINE-1.  There you go.  866-FU-LINE-1.  If you're, you know, calling in your FUs and you happen to have some gas, let it fly, okay? 
[02:58:30]  All right.  I don't have no gas for y'all.  All right.  We'll do it that way.  That's a great idea.  We'll get the listeners involved, okay?  Is that going to be hard to call up rings, you get connected, and then have to save that  fart?  Wow.  Like you feel a fart coming.  Now you've got to call, leave the fart?  Well, you can basically call and say, I don't have an FU, but I have this for you.  No, but I mean, it's going to take a while, but by the time you feel it, you might lose  it.  Right.  You know, if you hold a fart in too long, it just goes somewhere. 
[02:59:00]  It goes back up in.  It goes back.  It comes out later, but you don't know when.  Would you like to go to the listeners' houses and record them yourself, Anthony?  I mean, this is the best we got.  Travis, get on that.  This is the best we got.  If you want to leave farts on the FU line, do it, because I think we're going to have  a wow siding line soon.  Yeah, we're working on that.  We're going to take one of the existing lines and turn it into a wow siding line.  What do we have that, by November when it's cold again?  No, I talked to Bruce and Mars about it last week.  It takes a few days to set up.  Hard to believe we can't get advertisers on this show, even if we wanted them.  You know, the three lines we have are for farts, fuck yous, and tit showings. 
[02:59:30]  That's what makes us special.  You just got to time it out, right?  Like, ring, ring.  Hello, welcome to the FU line.  Hi, I'm Bill from Oklahoma.  Now you're squeezing them out to the, uh, now only dogs are hearing these.  That was really kind of squeaked out.  That almost sounded like a wink.  You're at the end of your run.  No, not.  You're going to be driving from your butt soon.  I know, my asshole's just going to open up and go, 
[03:00:00]  That's a great visual.  And there's a great example of a fart you can leave on the FU line, okay?  Let's say hi to Scott in Tennessee.  Scott.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Oh, it sounds like your farts are muffled by a fucking marshmallow.  All right.  Perhaps there's still a marshmallow in there.  Thank you, Scott.  Vinny from Oceanside.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Listen, best fucking game ever.  Keep it going, man. 
[03:00:30]  Keep it going.  All right, we'll do that.  It does rule.  Ben in Connecticut.  Ben?  What's up?  Click.  What's up, Ben?  Hey, happy birthday in advance, Jim.  Thank you.  I just want to say that Jim has tremendous mic technique.  I think it sounds like Opie's all sound like there's microphones in his large intestine.  Oh, very good.  I've commented a few times on how Opie uses the side of the mic,  which I think does muffle it a bit.  And Jimmy is right there, front of mic to asshole.  Perfect link-up. 
[03:01:00]  You have to be, because I'm used to talking into a mic,  so I kind of know how to line up the two fat cheeks around something with awful shit coming out of it.  Fifteen years of stand-up.  Yes.  Yes, in Ohio?  Is that your name?  Hi.  Hi.  What's up, yes?  I'm doing good.  What's going on?  What's up?  I just wanted to say I was driving to work,  and that guy that called and said that the game was boring,  I just want to say that he's an idiot and that I'm a girl,  and I think it's fucking hilarious.  Thank you.  And hot.  And really hot.  All right, thank you.  You're all good. 
[03:01:30]  Yes.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's say hi to Brian in Michigan.  Brian, make it fast, because we've got to get back to the fart game.  Hey, I love the fart game.  I was playing in a band a few years back,  and I just had some rank fart, you know, like rotten propane, you know,  and I let one loose right in the middle of Warpig,  cleared out the whole bar, 125, 150 people.  You know, and they go, Warpig's got the power?  I grabbed the mic.  Yeah, cleared out the bar, man.  All right, right on.  You've got to make these calls quick before we all lose our hard-ons. 
[03:02:00]  All right, back to the fart game.  Here's the next fart.  Right, that's that.  Wait a minute.  Jimmy's running out of juice, man.  Am I?  Yeah.  Excuse me?  You know what, disrespect me. 
[03:02:30]  That arms out stretch thing you did was great.  Awful.  Yeah, that was the Titanic.  Everyone's confused now.  There's live farts going on, recorded farts.  Yeah.  It's just hot.  Holy crap.  All right, so those were live farts.  Back to the game.  This is the fart you guys have to study.  Yeah.  All right, what do you think, Anthony?  It's Ty.  4-4.  I'm going to go with Jimmy.  I'm going Opie.  Oh, wow.  Okay, here we go.  Here we go.  We will have a leader.  Are you trying to tell me that this show goes off on tangents? 
[03:03:00]  Yes, sometimes it does.  I remember this one time we went off on a tangent.  I was on a train.  Yes, Jimmy, were you going to fart?  Please don't.  Oh, it stinks so bad.  Just fart so we can start the bit.  And we're back live.  Well, there was a wrong and a right.  Who got that one right?  I got it right.  Anthony.  Poor Steve.  Steve, I got it wrong.  Yeah, I've been taking these in the face courtesy of Jimmy.  All right, the next fart.  Here it is. 
[03:03:30]  I can actually hear grunge genes moving.  I was going to say, was that through chains?  Oh.  That is really bad.  That's rank.  That's actually the sound of gas leaving the body  as a car runs over a stomach.  One more time.  Oh, you have to go back. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah.  Beep, beep.  I got to hear again.  One more.  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Here we go.  All right.  I'm saying Jimmy.  Yeah.  That's Ope's.  Yeah.  I'm saying Opey again.  Oh, okay.  Let's tie it up.  Basically, you got to, it tells the hard drive that there's actually MP3s there.  I have a Reno player, which actually reads all the SD cards.  And, yeah, I know it sucks a lot, but I have a pot. 
[03:04:30]  Might have been mine.  Ope laughed too fast.  I know.  I will bet money it's mine.  And I'll tell you why in a second.  Whose is it?  That was a gym.  Oh, man.  I usually fart later in the show.  But you laugh too quickly.  You laugh much too quickly.  I could never get your mouth that fast.  Because you don't just fart and put your mouth down.  Ha, ha, ha.  Who got that right?  Ant is.  I, uh, correct.  You got it.  Oh, Ant's undefeated.  Wow.  Well, Ant's also in here all the time.  So there's. 
[03:05:00]  You tell yourself whatever you have to.  Okay.  Ant knows my asshole.  And that's all that it was going to be like.  All right.  Next fart.  Oh.  Wow.  Oh.  Oh.  You can almost hear it whining.  It was sneaking out of it.  That's what happens if you sneeze underwater in your mask.  It whined like a puppy first and then. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, God.  Yeah.  All right.  Sounds like Qbert.  Anthony.  That one.  That's to Anthony.  I have to go with Opie on that one.  I think that's an Opie blast.  Yeah.  I think so too.  All right.  Are we done?  No.  We got one more page.  Done.  No.  I'm out of here. 
[03:06:00]  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Before you go to that Mitch Beck bit.  Jesus.  Yeah, let me get past you.  It's so funky.  Come here.  And we're back live.  Oh, it was Jimmy.  They're all so different.  Got that one wrong.  Such a variety of farting.  That muffled sound.  It's not you.  That was hilarious, that one.  All right.  The next fart. 
[03:06:30]  There's some clean up there.  That pause in the middle was actually a fluid-filled bubble.  What do you think?  It's Anthony.  Yeah.  Because no one got the other one right.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  I'm going to go with Jimmy.  I'm going with Opie.  You have to go with Opie.  That's one of those ones when he tries to fire it out.  Yeah.  It's just kind of...  Yeah. 
[03:07:00]  There's also been...  I don't think I like the title of this segment of the program.  Hold on.  This is the answer.  Sorry.  Yeah.  We're going to tape.  I don't think I like the title of this segment of the program.  I think it's very accurate, Anthony.  It's called Ants Going Insane.  And the problem is...  I don't believe I'm going insane.  I just think I have good hygiene.  Very hygienic.  We'll see how you react to this.  Oh, no.  You're going to have to change your underwear. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, God.  We had to react to say...  Is your dick hard, too?  I really wanted to have one of those booming ones.  And just like most of my jokes on this show, it failed miserably.  And we're back live.  Oh, my God.  Steve.  Yes.  So Steve got that one.  Yes.  Oh, game on.  Steve is only one behind.  One behind. 
[03:08:00]  Ooh.  Good way to phrase it.  Oh, wow.  That must have been in the middle of an argument.  That one was sprayed into a Tupperware bowl.  Right?  Listen.  Wow.  All right.  I think I have this one.  Yeah, I think so, too.  I am going to say Jimmy Norton.  That sounds like modern art being created.  And I will say it because I believe, for some reason, that doesn't even sound like it was  in the studio.  Is that taped, like, in the bathroom or something? 
[03:08:30]  No.  It was in the studio, but the isolated clip that you just played, I had to raise the volume.  Oh, you had to raise it?  There was some weird sound in there.  Okay.  Oh, wait a minute.  I'll say Jimmy, but let's see who it is.  Steve?  I think it's Jimmy, too.  Both say and Jimmy.  Here's the answer.  How is this going to affect you?  Oh, we'll tell you after the break.  We don't do that on the news.  We should have.  We have more integrity than we do.  Mark that one down, boys.  All right. 
[03:09:00]  We're back live.  Yeah.  That was Jimmy.  That was Jimmy?  All right, Jimmy.  So you both got that right?  All right.  All right.  I'm sweet.  Okay.  The next fart in the Who Farted game, put together by Danny and Travis.  Oh.  Whoa.  Sprayed out into the pants a little.  That doesn't even sound like a fart.  It's like Velcro. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  Well, I have to say, Opie doesn't have that robust oomph that Jimmy's does.  I've got a good baritone one in there, though.  Mine is sneaky.  Go ahead, Steve.  I think it's Jimmy.  I think it's Jimmy.  Could tie it up here, right?  Yep.  Here comes the answer.  No carrot ties.  It's a machine bunnies have been working on.  Thank you, Lord.  Get me my carrot tieser. 
[03:10:00]  I know what the word was.  What was that?  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  And we're back live.  That was Jimmy.  I think that was a fine joke that a carrot tieser is a machine bunnies have been working on.  Jimmy.  Yes.  So who got that right?  Who got that right?  I think I did.  Steve.  Oh, Steve did.  Yeah. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, my God.  We're tied with just a few farts left.  Damn.  Pay attention.  I'm just trying to pay attention to at least some kind of significant thing, but I think  I'm tricking myself.  Here's the next fart.  Oof.  See, the more we do, the harder it gets.  Yeah.  I'm second-guessing myself.  Got to go with my first instinct, which is...  That one's Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's Jimmy.  Both saying Jimmy?  No.  Jimmy says no?  Of course he does. 
[03:11:00]  I think that's one of mine, actually.  It is.  Let's listen.  Thank God I'm not listening to this program right now.  No.  Thank God, because we recorded this ahead of time.  No.  I'm still sleeping.  I'm hoping.  That wasn't me.  Thank you, Jimmy.  That was Jimmy.  I did the show.  Jimmy.  We're back live.  I know you better than you know yourself.  So you both got that one right.  Still tied, okay.  It's a little mousy thing.  Almost done here, kids.  Almost done.  Here's the next fart. 
[03:11:30]  Oh.  Wow.  Oh.  Like an old cowboy spitting into a spittoon.  Ding.  There's like a weird echo.  That's the sound it would make if you actually pinched the nose of an invalid and farted into  their mouth when it opened.  That little bounce around the tongue and out.  What do we think, boys?  Hmm. 
[03:12:00]  I know I've been picking Jimmy a lot, but I've got to say Jimmy again.  Yeah.  Okay.  Me too.  Really?  Yeah, I think so.  Here's the answer.  And he's got that L problem where he can't say his L's.  His L's come out like, oh, that, or like a fart out of Jimmy's ass.  What about Bonnie?  I know.  I thought he rolled her chair away, put her arms out, just like, what the, why, why?  And we're back live.  Yeah.  Both got that right as well. 
[03:12:30]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Can't second guess myself.  We got two farts left in the who's farted game.  Two left.  Could be anyone's game here.  Here's the next fart.  Wow.  Wow.  That was impressive.  Textbook.  Sheesh.  Wow.  The farts were getting boring there for a while.  Oh.  That was that.  Awful.  Yeah.  I need some of these on my replay.  That has a snap shot at the end. 
[03:13:00]  Listen to the very end.  The asshole snaps and smacks like a clapping hand.  Listen.  Like.  I need some of these on my replay so I can make music.  That is something.  I think I.  Yeah.  Who are you going with, Steve?  I'm saying that's Opie.  That's got Oatneal written all over it.  Yeah.  I want to say that, too.  But, you know, I'm going to play the odds here.  I'm going to try to pull ahead with this one. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, boy.  Going against my first instincts, I think it is Opie, but Jimmy has longer duration farts  than Opie does, generally speaking.  His last longer.  Because that one had the Hughes bounce.  Yeah.  That one had that tone that the last one he did.  It just.  Oh, God.  That's bassy.  Absolutely.  Sounds like a brass instrument.  It really does.  But I'm going to say Jimmy. 
[03:14:00]  Uh-oh.  I'm going to say Jimmy.  All right.  Here's the answer.  This is when Bruce called in and tried to distance himself from the interlocutors.  From the production that we had goofed on so much.  Goofed on?  Crucified.  This is what I think of the interlocutors.  What up?  See, that was.  God, that was a biggie.  I'm done.  Why do your gansters always sound like they're going around wet meat?  And we're back alive.  See, yours have a bass. 
[03:14:30]  Mine tend to be more like here.  You're going to hurt yourself, Jimmy.  Oh, no, I won't.  You've got to have a hemorrhoid by now, man.  Jesus.  That was a live fart that's confusing everyone in Radio Land.  All of yours sound like when you take a balloon and pull the place that you blow into it and  make it whistle.  That's exactly what I'm thinking.  There are all these high-pitched things.  See, you know what it is?  My body gets excited when it hears other farts. 
[03:15:00]  It feels like, oh, we have company.  It's okay to come out now.  All right, here's.  Ah!  Oh, my God.  I know.  That deodorant is awful.  Stop spreading the deodorant towards Anthony.  It bothers him.  All right, here's the deal.  We have one fart left in the who's farted.  Who farted again?  Damn it, Jimmy.  Steve is in the lead, right?  Yeah.  For this final fart, because it would be so easy for Steve just to say what Anthony said.  Same thing I said.  So you're going to have to write down these.  Secret ballad.  Secret ballad for the last fart to keep it fair. 
[03:15:30]  This is sexy.  And can this be a two-pointer?  That way I could win.  What?  No, we can't.  No, you guys have to have a kiss-off.  I'm excited now.  Looks like Steve wins.  I know.  You guys have to shake hands.  All right, I give up.  Steve, we can take it.  See, I've been doing, like, oh, no.  I'm going to do this one positioned differently.  Oh, my God.  That was bad. 
[03:16:00]  I switched.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, that's right.  I switched positions, and I decided to put my legs up.  Put the wall up.  Normally what I'll do is I'll jump up and put my hiney towards the mic, but this time I actually  brought the mic home.  You got into a gynecologist.  Yeah.  When girls go to the gynecologist's office, that's what you did.  You put your feet up in the stirrups.  That really smells like dog shit.  Oh, God damn it, Jimmy.  Come on.  Come on, guys.  It's off of the show.  You've got to stop now. 
[03:16:30]  All right, I'll quit.  That really smells bad.  I promise.  All right, here it is.  The final fart in the Who Farted game.  All right, let's listen.  I know that one immediately.  Huh?  I know that one immediately.  All right, hold on.  Here it is again.  It's very important.  Okay.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  Oh, God.  You've got to write down your answers.  All right.  Hand them over to me.  Thank you, Steve. 
[03:17:00]  Steve is in the lead by one, so Anthony needs to get this one right, and Steve obviously  needs to get this one wrong.  It's on the back of this.  All right.  Steve has said Jimmy.  Ah, yeah.  That's what I said.  You said Jimmy?  Yes, I did.  I know the answer, by the way.  What's the answer?  Neither.  Go ahead.  Oh.  Well, Jimmy's on to something.  It was a trick question, ladies and gentlemen.  This is a mystery guest.  Oh.  Guest in the Who Farted game.  Yeah, I kind of figured that would be coming, just kind of, again, the numerical odds.  But Fan almost blew because he held up a mystery guest sign, but there's only one mystery guest 
[03:17:30]  that's ever done that.  All right.  Wow, really?  Don't give it away.  Oh, man.  Don't give it away.  So, officially, Steve has won the Who Farted game, but just for laughs and giggles, here's  Who Farted the last time here.  Thank God.  There's a weekend coming up.  Just kind of diffuse this a bit.  I just don't.  Here, this will.  All right.  A celebrity fart.  There you go.  Jay Moore.  Ah, yes.  Hey, Jay Moore.  That's great.  I didn't know.  I thought it was.  I was going to say that. 
[03:18:00]  Jay Moore.  That's right.  I remember that.  I remember that.  Wow, that was a long time ago.  Damn, I wish I would have known.  And that ends the Who Farted game.  It would be nice to play a little Who Farted jingle here.  Could have wrote that down and fucked up everything.  Now, I have my...  You've got to help me cheat in there, guys.  Well, if you were nicer to them, maybe they would help you out.  I am the nicest guy ever to the guys in the glass booth.  You're not.  I am.  You're really awful.  Very nice.  I am really nice.  You don't caress them?  There's caressing going on here? 
[03:18:30]  Yes.  Did you know that Travis likes to be rubbed behind his ear?  He likes when you take the pinky finger and go...  Behind his ear and his little leg kicks out.  And he promises to watch more TV.  His job.  Wow.  It really stinks in here.  I was hoping we could play that game and not have it stink in here because it's just  recording.  I thought that when I held up the guest list.  All right.  We'll break.  But thanks to Danny and Travis for the job well done. 
[03:19:00]  Full farted game.  And how about a thanks to our assholes.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, you just did.  Them too.  Hold on.  Hold on.  What?  What do we got?  Yeah, hit that.  We said that he rang up.  The scores told him.  He rang up.  It was over 50 grand.  Something like that.  Yes.  Over...  Jesus Christ, Jimmy.  What?  Holy shit.  Somebody party.  Somebody party in here.  Oh, my God.  Somebody party in here. 
[03:19:30]  The worst smell ever in my life.  Oh, my God.  It won't go away.  That is disgusting.  That is disgusting.  Disgusting.  Disgusting.  Disgusting.  It's in my nostrils.  Somebody party.  Somebody party in here.  Dude, that's horrific.  Oh, Jesus.  Somebody party.  Oh, my God.  Shut up.  I can't bust you.  It won't stop.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  It's awful. 
[03:20:00]  I had a burger on the next one.  Oh, my God.  I need something.  I'm going to throw up.  It could be the worst one ever.  It's like rotting eggs.  Eggs.  Eggs.  Like suns through the hourglass.  So is the O&A virus.  What can I honestly say?  Anybody rips me off.  When I hear the same exact bits done, that's how I say it.  I mean, what about wow?  That's totally their idea.  Oh, there you go.  Okay.  There's something new.  Well, and then.  There's something new.  You know what?  I used to do that in Washington, D.C. 
[03:20:30]  Tell them, Fred.  I used to have people tie bandanas around their cars so that women would take their clothes  off in the cars.  Dude, get rid of it.  All right.  Well, I mean.  Give me an original idea.  Come on.  I mean, I know.  I used to have my listeners tie a bandana around their car.  I mean, I've done it all.  What about going off on a man?  I totally know that's you.  All right.  Okay.  Whatever.  I got to go.  Please.  I don't really want to get into a discussion like this.  He's so delusional.  That is really funny.  Someone found the clip.  Yeah, that's something we couldn't play on the old show because of the gag order that 
[03:21:00]  he placed on us.  How do you tie a bandana around your car?  That's a great one.  That's a big bandana.  What's the matter?  My car has cancer.  People throwing frisbees to their cars.  Jump and grab it.  God, just showing your age, man.  You can't even tie bandanas to antennas anymore.  It's all hippied out.  You honk the horn.  Beep, beep.  Dude.  Oh, dude. 
[03:21:30]  He's so delusional.  Oh, man.  Just admit it.  Wow, it's such an original idea.  I invented everything.  I've done it all.  He even said, I've done it all.  Wow.  Even the stuff that's going to be invented, I did it already.  There's no real idea.  I went into a time machine and I already did it.  Everyone should just kill themselves, Robin.  Right.  I've done it all.  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  I was the first one to do anything.  I cracked it up.  Marconi ripped me off, Robin.  Remember the, what was that thing called?  Dot, dot, dash, dash, dot Morse code.  It was Howard code earlier. 
[03:22:00]  The guy ripped me off.  I invented SOS.  Hoo-hoo-hoo, Robin.  What a complete jackass.  He's the guy.  Wow.  Wow.  He invented wow.  And it had nothing to do with whip him out Wednesday.  Wow.  It was tying a bandana around your car.  Thank you, Howard.  And what were we supposed to do if you saw, like, say...  I don't know.  He didn't really explain it very well.  Of course she's not going to explain.  If someone had a bandana tied around their car somehow, girls would get naked in the car? 
[03:22:30]  It wasn't even flat.  Girls would get naked.  They're driving, taking their clothes off, crashing into a button, Mr. Robin.  I invented traffic accidents.  A bandana around an antenna that reminds me of something else I've heard.  It's called a fucking flag.  That's not exactly somebody's fucking invention.  I invented that, Robin.  They say Betsy Ross did that.  I sewed the stars on.  Ooh, it was all me.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I honestly don't care. 
[03:23:00]  I don't care.  I invented that.  I invented that.  Robin and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Yeah, I guess that's true, though.  We're working on a penthouse magazine signing.  Ooh.  Anthony and I and little Jimmy Norton featured in the latest issue of Penthouse magazine.  Pretty long article, lots of pictures, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[03:23:30]  Check it out for yourself.  It's available on newsstands now.  And I guess we're going to get together for a quick two-hour signing, maybe at the Penthouse  Club here in New York City.  Ooh.  That could be really, really cool.  So we'll see.  Stay tuned for details on that little one.  And don't forget, tomorrow we're in best-of mode because we're flying out to L.A. for  the X Games.  We're going to be at the Home Depot Center Friday, broadcasting live from the X Games.  And the showtime is changing Friday.  It will be 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. on the East Coast. 
[03:24:00]  That will be 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. for you West Coasters.  Okay?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  And in the break, Anthony said to me, he goes, hey, Jim, do you read that story?  I like to wind up Jimmy a little bit.  Well, you are completely right.  And I'm like, what story?  He goes, no, you probably didn't read it.  He goes, go to page 16 of the post.  And I look at page 16.  He goes, no, no, up.  By the dental implants ad.  So I look up.  And Anthony points out that here's the story. 
[03:24:30]  Crown Heights Jew beaten by three blacks.  A Hasidic man was attacked by three black men spewing anti-Semitic slurs at him as he walked  to his Crown Heights home.  It said the three men accosted him from behind, punched him in the face, knocked off his glasses  and shouted, hey, Jew, what are you doing here?  Let's get the Jew.  Three Hasidic men came to this guy's aid and the attackers ran off.  Let me repeat that.  Hey, Jew, what are you doing here? 
[03:25:00]  And then said, let's get the Jew.  Page 16 of the New York Post next to a dental implants ad.  Yeah.  Fucking Nick, that fat Nick, who again, little thug prick, these guys were thug pricks,  got into it with each other because a thug recognizes the thug.  I'm not saying Nick's a great guy.  And it's front page news of both of these dog shit New York papers.  Yeah.  The fucking political correctness in this city is, it's vomit inducing. 
[03:25:30]  For days it was front page news.  Hey, Jew, let's get the Jew.  How is that not the same merit of outrage?  Where is the black community?  Where is the press?  Nowhere.  It's a hate crime.  Under their, uh, under the presses.  Um, what the fuck's the word I'm looking for?  Under what dictates a hate crime?  It certainly is.  Definition.  Thank you.  Oh, wow.  Fuck. 
[03:26:00]  Under their presses.  Under the presses definition.  Oh, press, okay.  Oh, the presses definition.  It's a hate crime.  And it's not that there are no, that they don't care about Jews.  It's not that they're, uh, it's that they're so afraid of being misconstrued as racist by  criticizing somebody black on a racial issue.  That's it.  You can't.  You're not allowed.  You're not allowed.  These, uh, three black guys, uh, racist.  They're attacking a guy and, uh, spewing racial epithets. 
[03:26:30]  Eh.  Let's see.  Daily News.  I'm just curious as to where it is here.  Oh, uh, I don't think you'll find it.  No, because anyone, how can anybody not recognize that the press, Fox is conservative.  Yes.  Mm-hmm.  But to think that the other papers or the other media outlets don't have a slant.  Let's see.  All right.  I'm trying to get through the 40 pages.  Where was it on the broadcast news, uh, on TV, where they were a hate crime today?  Where, where were they?  I don't, they were too busy standing in the fucking subway complaining that there might 
[03:27:00]  be racial profiling, uh, from people trying to idiotically protect their own lives from  being blown apart.  Right.  By a backpack bomb.  Page 16.  I'm not that conservative.  I, honest to God, am not.  I really, I know I sound like a bush lover.  I'm for stem cell research.  I'm for gay marriages.  I don't give a shit.  I'm not that conservative.  A boot in the belly in eight months pregnancy?  Absolutely.  Sure.  Whatever it takes.  Or as I like to call it, you put your foot out, there go the steps, the old whoops-a-daisy. 
[03:27:30]  Wow.  Hey, Jew, what are you doing here?  And let's get the Jew.  Yeah.  If that isn't, uh, hate crime, and then they beat him.  And they beat him and smacked and punched him and attacked him.  Three on one.  Where the fuck is the mainstream media?  The Times would never cover it.  Never.  They'd actually apologize to the young man, for the young man, for that annoying Jew being 
[03:28:00]  in their black sight line.  That fucking liberal rag.  Yeah, liberal rag.  Yeah.  Sorry, folks.  Disprove what I say, please.  Can the press for once report something like this as a racial crime from the other end?  It's just evident every day.  Every day, stuff like this is just right in your face.  People don't want to see it.  You tell them, look, why is it on page 16?  Why isn't front page news like stupid fat Nick and, uh, and the black guy he clubbed  over the head with a baseball bat, who was into, I don't think, I, I don't know, but 
[03:28:30]  I doubt the Jew was walking around looking to steal cars that night, too.  Absolutely.  That was a three on three.  This was a three on one.  This guy was walking home, not a criminal.  They were three on three.  And, uh, the guys were there to rob a car.  Yeah.  And yet that is still front page news.  How does anybody not want to throw up?  And he's still in jail with no bail.  He's still in jail.  Because no judge wants to give him bail or he will be crucified by, uh, blacks and the 
[03:29:00]  media as being, look at this guy, this racist judge let this racist out of, uh, jail.  So he sits there and rots.  He hits some guy over the head, uh, a car thief over the head with a bat.  And, uh, he's in jail.  This page 16.  Where's the civil libertarians?  Where's all, like, the New York, uh, uh, civil liberties union, ACLU?  Where are you being vocal about something like this?  You're not.  It's expected of them, Jimmy.  Exactly what it is.  With those people, it's expected.  So we don't make that much of a fuss. 
[03:29:30]  Okay.  We have one more story to get to before we get out of here.  Fucking newspapers suck.  They do, they do it on, it's, it's not, again, nobody sits down.  It's like the JFK assassination.  Nobody sits down and says, all right, guys, don't do this.  It's an unspoken rule.  You just know it exists.  You know it exists.  But you know what?  Oh.  Oh.  I was so glad I didn't have to go into cheery mode right there. 
[03:30:00]  What happened?  You wrong button pushing son of a bitch.  You have the, uh, I'm not feeling too good about myself.  You had the wrong template on, didn't you?  I'm not feeling too good about myself.  Oh, don't let it get you down.  My whole responsibility during that rant was to push one lousy button and I couldn't do it.  You could do it.  It was a mistake.  Oh, we all make them.  But I tried.  I did.  It happens.  But it's every time you look at it, that's what you see in the media.  Oh.  I didn't push that one. 
[03:30:30]  That's a good idea, too.  All right, well.  Oh, wait, wait.  Oh, man.  There you are.  Get the hotness back in the show.  All right, here we go.  We have one more story to get to.  This is a big story today as well.  Listen to this.  Talking about violent video games and that controversy getting even hotter, this time  the controversy is over a game called Bully that has not even hit store shelves yet.  Dozens of people from a group called Peaceaholics showed up at the downtown offices of Rockstar  Games. 
[03:31:00]  Protesters complain Bully encourages students to harm and even kill their classmates.  It's a school violence simulator.  You'd have to wonder about an adult who would play this game, and it's clearly pitched to  teenagers.  Take two, Rockstar Games produces Bully.  The same company released the game Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, which is the subject of lawsuits  and a federal investigation.  Rockstar says a rating of M for mature should keep Bully out of the hands of teenagers. 
[03:31:30]  Wow, Rockstar.  Rockstar.  Just getting beat up.  Fucking, but the most important thing is that there are people that actually say, I have  to go to a Peaceaholics meeting, and nobody kicks them in the groin.  Peaceaholics?  That's also known as Douches Anonymous.  Bunch of nerds.  That is horrible.  Peaceaholics.  And their whole battle cry is that they are not asking that this be taken off the market 
[03:32:00]  or that they stop making it.  Okay.  They are actually demanding that they stop making it.  Rockstar.  Well, it's funny.  How about Peaceaholics?  Let's see.  Maybe you could go to Crown Heights, you fucking cowards.  Maybe you could go to Crown Heights and protest, hey Jew, what are you doing here?  And let's get the Jew.  Maybe you want to get something done.  You want to fucking protest a video game.  How about protesting something like that? 
[03:32:30]  Of course, video games are easier.  Of course, they're safe.  Real life, you've got to deal with real people.  Nah, it's a problem.  This is easy.  Bully, this sounds like a game I would play.  I don't know any adult that would play this.  Well, you've got to question what that adult's all about if they play a game like this.  That's what they said.  You've got to question.  You know what you question?  There is no question.  It's fun entertainment.  They call these things violence simulators, like you're training, like you're in training  when you play this.  Well, that's the way this angle that they're taking with this whole thing.  Of course it is. 
[03:33:00]  It's not.  It's an entertaining game.  Teaching people how to kill cops.  How fun is this to just mosey around this school of preps and beat them up and be the bully?  It's great.  You crack them over the head with things.  You go to parties.  You get your aggression out that way instead of actually doing it.  Or you just play the game because it's fun.  Why does everyone have to look at these games like they're violence simulators, cop killer simulators?  They put these labels on these things that they're not. 
[03:33:30]  It's just entertainment.  It's like sitting in front of a friggin' movie.  When you watch a movie about a murderer, are you a serial killer?  Are you in training to become a serial killer?  No, you're watching it to entertain yourself.  This is an interactive movie.  That's what these are.  Oh, Jimmy.  And video games are made with bad taste in mind.  Right.  Right.  Always has.  That's what people want to play. 
[03:34:00]  They understand there's bad taste in mind.  You also want to do things that you wouldn't, couldn't do in real life.  You want to fly a plane?  You get a flight simulator.  You want to go into space?  You get one of the space games.  You want to violently bludgeon someone over the head with a club?  You get a game like GTA.  You want to dress like a faggot?  Get EverQuest.  Hey.  Now, what's wrong with a wizard robe and a pointy hat?  And a what? 
[03:34:30]  What's that thing you have?  The lampier?  My rapier.  Oh, yeah.  Rapier.  It's appropriate you wear a robe.  It's a wizard robe with some tear-stained tissues in the pocket.  Oh, yeah.  Is that a silent one, Jimmy?  What?  Did you let a silent one out?  Because it is so bad.  It is.  I got to get out of here.  There's a good observation here from Dwayne.  Go ahead, Dwayne.  Dwayne.  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up, Dwayne?  I don't know if you guys have seen any of the graphics from Bully yet, but if you look  at the main character, he looks just like little Jimmy Norton. 
[03:35:00]  There is a resemblance.  Well, I'm looking.  It looks like a very angry Jimmy.  I don't know.  I'm not a bully.  I've never been a bully.  I don't like to pick on weak things or strong things.  I just talk shit and hide.  You're at a boarding school, and the character's name is Jimmy.  He has full academic schedule, but that doesn't mean he actually goes to class.  It's totally up to you whether Jimmy pays attention or neglects his studies. 
[03:35:30]  See, I guess you could theoretically play this game where you just go to class.  Here's the deal.  Well, listen to this.  You know, young protesters, they showed up there.  Okay, they're carrying banners reading, President Bush saved the youth.  Don't let us down.  And then they quote some of these people.  This is what's driving me nuts today.  It's important that we're here today because violent images seen on games are copied by kids.  Where's your studies, asshole?  Please give me one study that I can read about this.  No one has been able to prove this.  They would love to prove this fact. 
[03:36:00]  It would be so easy for them to shut down the video game industry.  They cannot prove that.  No.  They say they say.  We're trying to stop people from getting hurt before it's too late.  Too late.  Let's see.  They're just, they are just ripping away your entertainment people.  They got studies all over the place.  They are trying to prove this point.  They just can't.  Carrying it away.  We love our video games.  Don't take them away from us. 
[03:36:30]  Well, you're over 30.  You can't possibly play them.  Phil Mushnick.  But I'm just, you know, but they're going to tone them down.  There's a reason why video games are pretty much outselling DVD movies at this point.  Yeah.  People are really, really into their game in these days.  What's the name of that organization that was protesting?  Peace.  Oh, Peaceaholics.  Peaceaholics.  Right.  Peaceaholic.  Ugh.  AnthonyGameFly.com.  I mean, we love our gaming.  We love our games.

I learned that some people should just listen to this show.  Sorry, truckers.  Perfect.  A lot of truckers called today.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  I want to know what I learned today.  Go ahead.  I learned when you fart, it smells, it sounds like lumpy oatmeal dumps. 
[03:38:30]  And when Jimmy farts, it sounds like a noise that came out of a canister in a room full of juice.  Oh, Jimmy, one more thing.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Hung up on him.  Sean in Jersey, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Angel.  I learned today, she likes apples, he has a cock.  Kevin in Jersey, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned that little Jimmy Norton has aged 15 years in the past two weeks. 
[03:39:00]  And it is also okay for me to beat up Jews.  Yeah, pretty much according to local papers, yes.  Yeah, it's no big deal.  All right, we had another assault on the media today.  Listen to how it went down on the replay of this fine program.  Why are you bringing him a muffin with a candle?  It's not his birthday.  Birthday muffin.  Happy birthday to me.  Happy birthday to me. 
[03:39:30]  It's not the first time.  Happy birthday, dear Jimmy.  Happy birthday to me, you.  You could blow the candle out before you fart again.  Wait, let me see if my wish came true.  Let me open up my check.  Yup, it says Jim Opie Hughes.  Ha ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha.  And by the way...  I thought I was putting it into that whole birthday schtick.  The leader of the assault on the media contest for August is still Lion guy from Alabama. 
[03:40:00]  Yeah, the Lion was brilliant.  Our own Danny had one this morning.  That was really good.  Nice job.  The video's up on opianthony.com.  Danny and Travis, great job today, too.  Oh, yeah.  The hoop-fart game from Danny and Travis.  Very, very good.  And thanks to that tall kid in the back there for just kind of holding down the phones.  Eh, just hanging out.  Next time you hear us live, it'll be from the X Games Friday in L.A.  Showtime is 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. on the East Coast.  You figure it out for the West Coast.  See you in L.A.  Bye.  This concludes our podcast day.  It will be an Anthony show. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah, let's get the fuck out of here.  All right, listen.  Does that sound believable?  No.  Shut up, Jimmy.  You know I don't talk to you when the mic's on.  Oh, me.  Dick.  I'm not taking the Dick Cavett thing home.  No.  I don't.  This is what I think of Dick Cavett.  No, we need it.  Stop it.  But please.  Don't break it.  Don't break it.  What?  Don't break it.  Why?  Ben will kill you.  What?  I'll kill you.  Ben will kill you.  Oh, Jesus.  Explain it to Ben.  Let's go get lunch.  Now explain that to Ben. </pre>
