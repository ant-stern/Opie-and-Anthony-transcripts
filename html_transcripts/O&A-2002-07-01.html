<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with commercials for Nextel and DirecTV, immediately transitioning into a risqué segment titled "Fag Talk," featuring guest "Bob the Fag Man" and a sexually suggestive discussion of various cigarette brands, using the British slang term "fag" repeatedly.  The hosts then announced their upcoming vacations, detailing their plans: Opie's barbecue in LA with Dice, and Anthony's Fourth of July fireworks display on a boat in the East River with Billy Mack and Frenchy, anticipating heavy drinking and potential chaos.  They reminisced about a disastrous WOW sticker distribution event involving excessive drinking and unplanned bar stops, highlighting Jim Norton's antics. Billy Mack called in, confirming the boat trip and his own plans for heavy drinking, followed by a heated, homophobic argument between Anthony and Frenchy.

Listener calls followed, with PJ from New Jersey questioning their vacation plans, and Matt from New Jersey sharing an awkward encounter.  Ben, an associate, described his experience at the Gay Pride Parade, detailing explicit public sexual acts, sparking a discussion on the parade's increasingly sexual nature, its conflict with public sensibilities and the presence of children. Manuel, a caller who participated in the S&M section of the parade, described his BDSM activities.  This led to a debate about public displays of sexuality and the apparent contradiction between gay rights advocacy and overt sexualization.  NYPD officer Mike called, recounting his experience with an angry parade participant, while Psycho Tim contrasted this with the improved safety of Boston's South End due to the gay community's presence.  The show also covered the Opie and Anthony Best Wow Contest, including a caller unhappy with her photos, interspersed with more commercials. Another listener recounted a chaotic Gay Pride Parade experience involving mistaken identity, inappropriate advances, and an altercation. The hosts discussed this and their vacation plans before moving to a discussion of the film *Hardcore*, focusing on a graphically described scene and incorporating racial slurs.

The broadcast continued with a humorous anecdote about a fictional pornographic film casting call, featuring exaggerated descriptions of a porn actor ("Big Dick Black") and a flamboyant gay applicant, alongside a fictional George C. Scott character's reactions. This transitioned into a detailed, graphic description of a scene from a 70s porn film, focusing on a religious father's reaction to his daughter's sex scene.  Listener calls followed, including one detailing a bitter breakup and accusations of infidelity.  Numerous commercials aired during this section.  A significant portion focused on Wheelchair Fred, a recurring caller, whose conversation revolved around social interactions, self-described bisexuality, and experiences with prejudice against disabled people, punctuated by crude jokes and interruptions from the hosts.  They also discussed upcoming events, including a Boston show and the WOW Contest.  The segment ended with further WOW Contest discussion and an anecdote about a listener's encounter with Wheelchair Fred at a CD signing, also mentioning a McDonald's Happy Meal toy resembling a show regular.

A substantial portion of the show focused on Anthony's disastrous wedding.  It started with a news story about a wedding videographer's death, leading to jokes about the videographer's stupidity and potential use of the footage.  Listeners shared their disastrous wedding anecdotes, including a groom and best man fistfight and a bridesmaid's fashion clash. Anthony recounted his own wedding in detail, focusing on the subpar venue (a bar that later became a topless club), his wife's drunken behavior and resulting conflict with his mother and brother, and the overall chaotic atmosphere, emphasizing his regret. Audio clips from the event and its aftermath were played.  Numerous jokes about weddings, marriage, and other crude topics were interspersed with listener calls sharing negative wedding experiences and "F.U." line messages.  Plans for future show segments, including soliciting videos of bad best man speeches and childbirth experiences, were discussed.  More listener calls, Anthony’s wedding story, and offensive jokes concluded this segment.

Anthony continued recounting his wedding escapades, including his mother-in-law passing out with her legs on "the bison," who then rubbed them. He detailed his disastrous proposal involving a cheap ring, a freezing drive, and a drunken proposal at his mother-in-law's Christmas party.  Audio clips from the wedding, including the officiant's unusual pronouncements ("The power of Christ compels you!") and blunt closing remark ("You get nothing. You lose. Good day, sir."), were played.  Listener calls and emails followed, many mocking Anthony's experiences. A caller mentioned Anthony's ex-wife’s lawyer's assessment of Anthony’s net worth.  More commercials aired, including for diamonds, weight loss supplements, and alcohol.  The discussion shifted to a WOW contest photo shoot, focusing on Jim Norton's Spider-Man shirt and a female contestant’s comments.  News of a local adult video store raid, referencing an earlier commercial, was discussed.  Finally, a caller sought advice on a wrestling event sign.

The show's final segment began with a discussion of the death of Oswaldo Martinez, eaten by a crocodile while escaping prison.  This transitioned to a discussion of their friend Dice and an upcoming barbecue.  Listener Kelly recounted an embarrassing encounter with her father and his friend's "WOW" sticker.  The hosts lamented the absence of their "6 o'clock queef" segment, followed by calls from Tiffany offering to perform it, Huddy providing gunfire sounds, and another caller complaining about New York taking the best contest entrants from Philadelphia.  They bantered about a listener’s Spider-Man t-shirt and the Philadelphia-New York rivalry.  Numerous commercials aired, including for Mix's Lounge, Stacker2, Subaru, Mr. Holland's Opus Foundation, Molson Snow Jam, Priceline.com, and The Wiz.  The "What Have You Learned Today?" segment featured callers sharing humorous and offensive anecdotes.  The show concluded with further WOW contest discussion, final advertisements, and closing remarks, mentioning listener photo submissions and complaints.

[00:01:30]  Gopi and Anthony Show.  Oh, that's one, baby!  Woo!  Woo!  Yeah.  Sure.  This program funded by the British Arts Foundation.  Hello, welcome once again to Fag Talk, a show where we talk about fags and I must explain  something.  We're on in America now and we'd like to welcome our American audience except for the one thing  there seems to be some confusion with the cards and letters we're getting from the states  which say that fag is actually a word used for something else there and of course we're 
[00:02:00]  talking about cigarettes on the show.  So, let's get right to it.  Welcome to Fag Man.  Bob the Fag Man is here.  Right.  Welcome on the show.  You've got some lovely fags.  Let's see what you've got.  I've got some great fags this week.  This one right here is from Russia.  Grab the butt of that fag right there.  Right, okay.  I've got the butt right here.  I'm grabbing the butt of this fag.  Slide that fag right in your mouth.  Right.  I mean, slide the fag right in my mouth.  Now, I've got the fag.  Suck on that fag.  Mmm.  That's a great fag.  Mmm.  I love this one. 
[00:02:30]  Now, take a look at this fag right here.  It's much bigger than all the other fags.  Um, fag, it's...  Let me feel that.  Oh, I like the way that feels.  It's just like the fondle, this fag, right in my fingers here.  You fondle that fag for days.  And it's a big one.  It's big and it's hard.  If you want to go to a different way, you can go with a small fag.  Oh, look at that little fag.  That's a tiny little fag.  Look at you, little fag.  Come here.  Oh, yeah.  I like the taste of that one and I like sucking on that fag.  So, those are three for today.  That's wonderful.  Thank you so much for being here.  Bob the Fag Man's been on the show. 
[00:03:00]  Join us again next time when Bob and I visit a fag party.  Nothing but fags and drinks.  It's going to be wonderful.  All fags, all the time.  Right here on Fag Talk.  Bye-bye.  Ah, that's right.  Fags are cigarettes.  In England.  Right.  I'm big dick black.  Got ourselves a pretty little faggot.  I'm big dick black.  You don't want to hire niggas.  That's all.  I'm not gay.  I'm asses. 
[00:03:30]  I'm gay.  That's all stupid fag.  Hey.  Hey.  This is illegal, isn't it?  You're a girl.  Got milk?  We're cake subjected.  Let's all go home and find a nice wife over to make love. 
[00:04:00]  Hey, he keeps licking his finger and touching me.  Oh, you like that, don't you, faggot?  Oh, jeez.  I don't want to get the AIDS, fellas.  You don't die of AIDS!  I love that ball guy. 
[00:04:30]  Now, you don't like queers?  So, what are you saying?  He was banging cocktail wages as two at a time.  Today was yesterday, because yesterday was so close, like almost like it was the same day.  I'm not afraid to say I like other men. 
[00:05:00]  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Let's do it!  Let's do it, yes.  Um, I guess we have an announcement to make right off the bat.  Yeah.  Anthony and I are officially in vacation mode.  Vacation mode.  The switch has been flipped and, uh...  Man.  Let me tell you something about vacation mode.  Uh, Super GM Ken Stevens, who's on vacation himself.  Oh, he is.  He does not like when you and I get in vacation mode. 
[00:05:30]  Because it usually means trouble.  Because we usually let our guard down and do stupid things.  Something happens, we might say or do something, and, uh, it ruins our little, uh, vacation.  There's always something we do right before vacation, uh, that turns out to be really, really bad.  Yeah.  Where we get phone calls during vacation, and then we panic for the entire vacation,  and then we come back and have big meetings with the big boss.  I think we've grown, though, and learned from our mistakes, Opie. 
[00:06:00]  Ken was like, uh, can't you guys just take the whole week off?  I'd feel better that way.  No.  I'm like, no, man.  No.  We gotta be there for our listeners.  For a couple of days this week.  Actually, I couldn't get a flight out today.  Oh, is that it?  Is that why we're here?  No.  Nah.  You got some interesting stuff planned for the 4th.  I'm trying.  I'm trying to do something a little different.  I'm gonna fly out to L.A.  Did you get a hold of Dice?  Uh, he's dodging me.  Hey, Rick, you gotta get Dice on the phone. 
[00:06:30]  He's supposed to give me a little barbecue.  I like a boy, and that's that.  Dice always said to me, if I ever make it out to L.A., he would have me over, and he  would give me a barbecue.  For a barbecue.  So I've been calling him last week going, hey, guess what?  I'm coming to L.A.  Yeah.  It's time for you to get your little apron on and your big, uh, barbecue hat and cook  me up some steaks.  That's, uh, that's, uh, male harassment.  It is.  But he has not called me back. 
[00:07:00]  No.  So I don't know if I'm gonna get to do the barbecue with Dice.  I just wanna, I just wanna report of what that's like.  With the big chef hat and the, I'm the chef apron.  Look, what you gotta do, you take your fork and you turn your steak, like men did, back  on campfires with saber-tooth tigers when men were oysters.  You hear?  I hear me.  I hear me.  Wouldn't that be a great scene? 
[00:07:30]  I think I'm doing it just to get an hour of radio for when we get back.  Dice by the big barbecue.  How you take it?  Medium or well done?  Uh, medium.  Yeah!  Everyone knows that.  Don't say well done.  Hot dog or you bet?  You bet!  It's always you bet, right?  You bet!  Bosco or you bet?  Bosco or you bet?  You bet.  You bet!  Yeah!  So, I don't know.  I'm hoping that I could, uh, make that happen on my little, my little, uh, trip to L.A.  Are you trying to hobnob a little? 
[00:08:00]  Well, that would be hobnobbing.  No, it was just one of those things.  He always said, you know, you ever make it out to L.A., you know, I don't want to hang  a little bit and I want to give you a little barbecue.  Barbecue!  Yeah!  So, I'm calling him out on this one.  Yeah, okay.  Where's my barbecue?  All right.  So, we'll see.  And I just found out you're going to be on a boat in the middle of, what, the East River?  Yeah, I got fireworks?  I got to talk to, uh, Billy Mack.  Hopefully he'll call.  Um, no, this could be the worst seafaring disaster since the Titanic. 
[00:08:30]  I swear to you.  Yeah, I'm supposed to be heading into the East River with, uh, our pal Billy Mack.  If you remember, Billy Mack, remember that, um, that WOW bus that we did where we went  out to various locations around the area and handed out.  Why did we do that this year?  Wow stickers.  We should.  That was a great trip.  We, we kind of, we, we were a little, um, overzealous with our locations.  We decided we were going to go up to Westchester and out to Long Island.  It was ridiculous.  We still owe them in Westchester, you know.  I know. 
[00:09:00]  Because we blew them off.  We should explain.  Uh, we rented this, like, limo bus.  This thing was amazing.  We had three or four, uh, kegs of Sam Adams on board and, and Red Bull and vodka.  It was a rolling drunk truck.  And, and other things.  Yeah.  And we decided we wanted to hit, what, every county that we broadcast in in the New York  City area?  Yeah, it was going to be a huge sticker stop blowout with us doing the show live from the  bus, which was from the bus.  One of the hugest mistakes we ever made.  Drinking like crazy, stopping every half hour. 
[00:09:30]  At bars, too.  Sometimes some of the locations we stopped at were bars, so we went into the bars and we  started drinking there.  Like, the booze on the bus wasn't enough.  Yeah, and then, uh, I don't know, the first hour, it was, it was some good stuff.  Oh, yeah.  And then we slowed down.  We got big time hammered.  And then all of a sudden, we're like two, three hours late for, uh, for the stops.  Yeah, we got way behind in our schedule.  At first, we got it all scheduled out.  Yeah.  All right, we hit Brooklyn.  Then we'll go back.  We'll go into Jersey.  We'll hit some locations there.  We'll come back on the north side of Manhattan and then, uh, uh, drive out to Long Island. 
[00:10:00]  It turned out to be a five borough bar crawl.  Yeah.  Because, like, the, the first location, we're like, all right, we could do a shot.  We could do a shot, it'll be our, okay, cool.  But we gotta go.  We gotta, we gotta get to Staten Island.  And then we get to Staten Island, and it was like, by the time we got to Brooklyn, I guess  Brooklyn was the, where it all turned, right?  Yeah, we, we went to the Bean Post.  The Bean Post.  In Brooklyn.  And, uh, they, they.  And for some reason, we couldn't leave the damn place.  They treated us very well there with the, uh, Guinness and then, uh, shots.  We were doing Jägermeister.  Next, next thing you know, we're looking at the list of places we're supposed to be like, 
[00:10:30]  okay, look, we'll cancel this.  I don't think we're that popular in Westchester and Yonkers, so let's get rid of that one  right off the bat.  I think it was our third location, Brooklyn, and we were scratching things off already.  Let's see, Jersey.  Yeah, that small state, they, they, they, they won't miss us at all.  I don't think we have many listeners there.  And we're from Long Island, so they'll understand.  I think we went to two places.  We, we did get out to Long Island.  We did.  The last place we stopped there just was an unbelievable drunk. 
[00:11:00]  That's, that was the day I knew Jim Norton was out of his effing mind, because, uh, we're  at the bar at, uh, what bar?  Dublin Pub.  Yeah, Dublin Pub.  Yep.  And, uh, Jimmy is talking to this girl, and he goes to me, look, dude, look.  Because he's just having a normal conversation with this girl.  Like you were doing a bar, nothing too crazy, right?  Sure.  Sure, but the whole time he's talking to the girl, his whole entire mule, yambag and  all, is just kind of hanging out the front of his pants.  He pulled it all out, and I think he laid it on her leg at one point. 
[00:11:30]  I leaned, I didn't lay it on the leg, I just leaned in, and it kind of bumped the jeans.  But she had no clue what was going on.  And I was looking on, laughing, I, I, I don't know if I've ever laughed that hard.  I was trying to get Anne's attention, I'm like, duh, duh, duh.  You got, you got everyone's attention, I don't know if the, uh, Anne saw it.  No, I was hammered, but I wasn't seeing anything.  It was so freaking funny, man.  He's just standing there with his freaking mule out, talking to this chick.  We get into the bus, and, uh, Billy Mack.  Oh, we're getting back to Billy Mack, right. 
[00:12:00]  Billy Mack is at the back of the bus, just hammered.  The guy was gone.  Hammered.  And, uh, he, he wound up, um, losing his car in Brooklyn.  We dropped him off in Brooklyn, right?  And, and, well, you get a call from him later, I can't find my car.  I can't find my car.  Like, thank God you can't find your car, man.  He can drink.  He drinks so fast.  Like, you'll be drinking with him.  It's safe to say that when he's off duty, not doing his job, that he, he likes, uh, to tip him back. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, yeah.  He likes a few, uh, wobbly pops.  He is a seasoned vet, too, let me tell you.  Because you'll be drinking with him.  I said wobbly pop for Toronto, by the way.  A little wobbly pop.  Yeah, they appreciate that up there.  Go ahead.  You'll be drinking pretty good, you know?  And you're halfway down, and he's done, and he's one of those guys, come on, come on, what are you doing?  Come on.  Get it down, pussy, what are you doing?  And you're like, oh, chug it down, another one.  And he's just, whoosh, whoosh.  One after the other, the guy does not slow down.  And this is who I'm spending my 4th of July with. 
[00:13:00]  On a boat.  On a boat.  In the East River.  On a boat.  On the East River.  I'm watching the Macy's fireworks display over Manhattan.  We're not on high alert because of the terrorists.  We're on high alert because Billy Mac's on a boat in the East River, drunk.  Oh, Billy Mac, I can see him getting so hammered, he'll think he sees a terrorist ship and try to ram it.  Ramming speed!  I can see that happening.  I just, I figure it'll be very interesting.  It'll be like Rodney Dainfield on the water.  And Frenchy's going, too.  He'll be out there.  Look at your stupid Felt of July. 
[00:13:30]  Your stupid American customs.  Suck it.  We gave you that Statue of Liberty, you whore.  Oh, here's Billy Mac now.  Good.  I can confirm my resume.  The captain of the Exxon Valby.  Hey, Billy.  What'd you say, the Exxon Valby?  Yeah, we all know you can drink.  What's going on on the 4th, man?  Well, actually, just what you described, I just got a phone call from Frenchy who told me to put the radio on.  But I'll give you one better.  I just went out on a golf riding and lost the keys to my car this time. 
[00:14:00]  You're a mess, Billy.  So how big is the boat?  Well, we hold about 225 people, but we're only going to put 125 on it.  Wow, that's a big goddamn boat.  Yeah, it's not too bad.  It's not too bad.  We're only going to have Bud and Bud Light, though.  Yeah, right.  What about the booze?  Actually, if you want to, you've got to supply your own booze.  We're supplying the food.  I like my Captain Morgan.  I'll bring that along.  I think I have a bottle of that for you.  And where are we going to sit to watch? 
[00:14:30]  Actually, we have a primo spot.  Some of my on-duty friends will be in the harbor helping us get a close spot.  I love this, man.  So, but, you know, we'll have to do it.  It's going to turn out Anthony's going to be lighting the fireworks.  I know.  We'll be on the barge helping out Grucci.  All right, everyone ready?  Here we go.  All right, listen, guys.  I've got to go because I'm loading the boat with as much beer as I can put on it.  Au revoir.  All right, Billy.  Bye, Mr. Matt.  Take care, boys.  Peace.  There you go. 
[00:15:00]  Hey, Frenchy.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Frenchy.  Now you're going to...  You're going to see how a real country celebrates its independence.  Yeah, I think somebody's going to throw me overboard that day.  Not your stupid Bastille Day.  Shut up.  Shut up, you bitch.  Bastille Day is so much better than your 4th of July.  You suck ass, as always.  You and your stupid fireworks and your stupid rockets.  If we only had fireworks in World War II, we would have beat the Nazis without your help. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, we would be on the moon by now, you stupid.  But the French underground sets off our fireworks because we're all afraid of our explosives.  So the man in the beret with the cigarettes sets them off.  Yeah, but the resistance is going to be there and kick your ass.  Shut up.  You belong in the dump and the Chateau Dive.  You cannoli face.  Faggot.  Faggot.  More.  Shut up, you French faggot.  You wussie.  Why don't you walk in front of a truck and die? 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, I go in front of a bus and get rolled over and then picked up by a New York City garbage truck.  If the fireworks scare you, French, you can crawl into the catacombs.  No, I go and jump overboard.  I swim my way back.  I don't like the boom-boom explosives.  Reminds me of the Messerschmitts bombing our cities.  You stupid ass.  I put the stupid firework up your way and make you fly away, you stupid ass.  Place on ground.  Light fuse.  Wait for French to surrender. 
[00:16:30]  Faggot.  Faggot.  Faggot.  You can't take it, faggot.  Oh, it's not gunfire.  Let me drop my weapons.  I throw a grenade at you face, you stupid ass.  What comes out of it?  A flag that says bang, you faggot.  Yeah, I'm going to be drunk and kill you, you dumbass.  Pussy.  You stupid Eiffel Tower.  Why don't you put walls on that thing?  Put you sit on the Eiffel Tower, you faggot.  Huh?  Okay, you faggot.  I want to take it easy.  See you Thursday.  Bye-bye, faggot. 
[00:17:00]  I don't like the way Frenchy sounded like he was doing an impression of Frenchy.  Yeah, he starts doing an impression of himself.  Let me tell you.  And then he's like, oh, okay, guys.  See you later.  He's got a hint of an accent.  Oh, okay, guys.  PJ from New Jersey.  Vacation mode, like you guys have a real job.  Aren't you always on vacation?  He's right.  You're right.  Now, vacation mode, me and Ben start drinking at 3.15.  All right.  What else were we going to do here?  Today?  I know.  This guy.  This guy's going to set Ben off big time. 
[00:17:30]  Hey, Matt, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  What's up, O.N.A.?  Where are you calling from?  New Jersey.  Oh, okay.  Because you're on our national line.  I was wondering.  You were in New York City for the gay pride parade yesterday, huh?  No.  I'm a college kid.  I go to Rutgers, right?  So I deliver plants for people that buy nice cars.  It's kind of like a thanky thing.  Yeah.  Anyway, I've got to get a new...  Anyway.  Yeah.  I'm on 38th sheet, right?  Hey, Matt, Matt, Matt, Matt.  Matt.  No. 
[00:18:00]  You realize it's the year 2002, right?  Huh?  You realize it's the year 2002, right?  Oh, I understand, but I think it's just the funniest thing.  That's the whole point.  You should have seen these guys, though.  It's just in songs, and I know it's New York City.  Thank you, Matt.  Matt was trying some trick that was really popular in 1988.  Right, right.  And it's all flat.  Real flat.  And then he was trying to save face.  Yeah.  It's the year 2002, bro.  He thought we'd go, oh, oh, oh, no. 
[00:18:30]  Hey, Matt, why don't you give yourself a mullet and buy a Trans Am?  Jesus, you outdated dope.  I was, like, embarrassed for the guy.  Yeah.  Anyway, Ben was in the heart of the gay pride parade yesterday.  Oh, thanks.  Well, you called me from it.  You called him from...  Wow, he gave you a little phone call?  He goes, dude, I'm getting as east as possible.  I can't handle this anymore.  I went as far east as possible.  East of, you know, east of village. 
[00:19:00]  East village.  They take over downtown, man.  It's amazing.  And it's gotten to the point.  I'll tell you, me personally, I could care what the gay people do down there.  That's weird.  Could you give me the post?  Sure, Angel, I was here.  Ugh.  Like, I could care what the hell the gay people do down there on that day,  because I sure won't be down there.  But it's great when you see kids, like some parents taking their kids to the gay parade,  just to watch a parade, you know?  Hey, it's something to do.  It's a nice day.  We'll watch the parade. 
[00:19:30]  And it's gotten to the point where people are so afraid to tell the gays  what might be inappropriate for their parade.  But when some people years ago would try to say, hey, you know,  we don't want these guys marching down the road because they're doing this or that  and it's offensive, they've become so afraid of being labeled homophobic  that now anything goes out on the gay parade.  Anything goes.  And if you sit and watch this thing, you better sit because a nice concrete barrier,  a sidewalk on your buttock might be a wise thing to do because they are going off and 
[00:20:00]  just doing everything on the street.  You know how far we've come?  There's a picture in the post today.  Look at that.  Our mayor.  Yeah, Mayor Bloomberg.  It looks like he's copping a feel off of a big fat tranny.  He's shaking the hand of one of the...  Oh, he's shaking a hand.  I couldn't say it.  It looks like he was...  One of the parade participants.  We've come a long way.  There's not many politicians that would have done that until recently.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They usually avoid... 
[00:20:30]  They used to avoid the gay pride parade.  I just love the fact that, like, you know, the gay organizations are saying we want to  be treated exactly the same as everyone else, but we're like a parade to show you how different  and alternative we are.  Make up your mind, stupid asses.  Do you want to be the same as everyone or do you want to run around in dresses causing  a ruckus?  Different and alternative.  They want to show how they have sex with each other.  How they have man-on-man sex.  What kink they prefer.  Ben was giving me updates all day yesterday.  And at one point he goes, dude, I think two guys are having sex right in front of my 
[00:21:00]  building.  Of course they are.  It's an F-fest.  First of all, you know how guys are.  Guys just want to F all the time.  And this is an excuse for guys to all get together.  It's a big meat market for man junk.  Yeah, but there's also negatives.  Such an idiot.  Ben, some of your visions from yesterday.  The funniest thing of the whole day was the guy dressed in a gimp outfit walking down  the street on his hands and knees.  Like the gimp from Pulp Fiction.  Yeah.  With another guy whipping him. 
[00:21:30]  Wait, he was walking right down the other street on his hands and knees?  Walking down 7th Avenue on his hands and knees.  It was the funniest thing.  And a guy is whipping him.  How many blocks can you do that for?  That's what I was thinking.  I was like, hell the hell can this guy do?  It was hot yesterday.  That's like a rubber or leather suit that the gimp was wearing.  And they wonder why we don't want them as Boy Scout leaders.  Can you just wear suits and behave?  And behind the scenes?  You know, it was really, really sick.  Right behind the gimp, there was a...  Right?  Wasn't that it?  Sure.  Oh. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  And then Ben calls me and goes, dude, I just saw a guy with T's.  Oh.  It was crazy.  Was it just a regular guy?  It was a regular guy.  And he had a set of jugs on him?  Was he wearing a shirt?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But he had cans.  Huge.  Humongous.  Bigger than any of the ones in our contest.  It was the funniest thing ever.  That's great.  That is fantastic.  The gay parade.  Speaking of the gimp, there was a float with a bunch of gimps.  Guys, like, handcuffed with gimp outfits on. 
[00:22:30]  And they're playing, like, house music really loud.  A big rubber ball in their mouth.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  See, why do they have...  This is why people get annoyed gay people.  Why do you have to sexualize your parade?  Irish people aren't running around with their mules hanging out.  So, neither are the Puerto Ricans or anyone.  I mean, they do it in the park.  Well, the Puerto Ricans, yeah, they do it in the park.  Afterwards, yeah, but you understand what I mean?  People can't just be about their sexuality.  They have to, like, you know, this is what we do in bed.  Nobody cares.  Anthony and I have said this for years.  Why not a parade for guys that love menage a trois or a parade... 
[00:23:00]  Absolutely.  ...or a parade for guys that love lesbians?  Yeah.  You're judged on your sexuality because...  They will laugh you out of the city.  ...to associate you with it.  How many times do you hear gay organizations or someone not saying,  we are people, we're not to be judged on a sexuality,  we go to work, we do this, we do that,  yet the parade is completely based on sexuality  and what they're doing in the bedroom and the alleyways  and wherever the hell else they wanted to...  In front of Ben.  In front of Ben's place.  I was dying.  But it was... 
[00:23:30]  The problem is, is what you're saying,  there was, like, little kids...  This was off, way off the parade route,  and there's, like, guys on the steps of a building,  and they're just...  You know, there's kids walking around.  It's like, can't you guys go inside,  go into a room or something, you know,  just out in the open, the shirts off, everything.  I was driving home Saturday,  and I guess it's a whole gay weekend in the city  because out on the west side by the piers,  they had the big rainbow flag,  and I guess they were holding weddings or something.  There was a whole big thing going on,  and that bicycle path that goes up the west side highway, 
[00:24:00]  the things I was seeing on that...  There was a...  There was this gay guy whose shorts couldn't be any shorter,  where his ass cheeks are hanging out.  He's got his yam bag just, like, crushed.  He's on rollerblades with a little poodle pulling him  down the bike path.  And I'm just, like...  I'm looking around and going,  what the hell?  What the...  Who the...  Amazing.  And that was not an odd scene, you know?  It was a whole bike path. 
[00:24:30]  And, you know, you've got little kids,  bing, bing, bing, bing, on their bicycles,  just looking at half a hairy man-ass  hanging out Daisy Dukes.  It was amazing.  You get an anatomy lesson down there, man.  That's a great visual with the poodle.  With the little poodle, just...  Pulling him along.  Did the poodle have a nice new haircut?  Of course.  Oh, man.  They take care...  Because I drive down there every day on my way home.  I take the West Side Highway.  And every day, there's a crossing where you've got to stop for the light,  and it's not traffic. 
[00:25:00]  It's just a crosswalk that goes to the bike path.  The gay crossing.  It is the gay crossing.  Because that's all I've ever seen.  And they all got the little dogs,  and they are all taken care of meticulously.  They are just clipped and cleaned,  and they got the little bows in their hair,  and that's the owner.  And the dogs.  They got...  Yeah, that old gag.  I don't fall.  Gay people keep wearing their neighborhoods, man.  You've got to say they're...  I guess so.  If I live in a gay neighborhood, I don't.  But, I mean, I would be comfortable living there,  because they really are neat, clean.  You've got to have a clean street 
[00:25:30]  if your back is going to be on it getting banged by another man.  Apparently, they'll do it anywhere.  You just want to be dirty.  Manuel.  Yes.  How's it, buddy?  What's up?  Yeah, I was marching at the parade yesterday with the S&M crowd.  Okay.  Yeah, it was pretty fun.  We had the whips, the whole get-up and everything.  Are you a gay man?  Yes.  And you're a, what, dominatrix type of gay man, an S&M?  I practice hardcore bondage, straight jacket, flea bags, mummification. 
[00:26:00]  Wow.  All that fun stuff.  Do you like to be mummified, sir, or mummify others?  I've been mummified before, and I also mummified others.  Oh, well, you can't breathe.  That's why they wrap them up real tight.  That's sexy to dress up like a hostage and be brutally sodomized.  Well, Jim Nord, you can try it.  It'll get rid of your man boobs.  Oh.  Sir, that was a low blow to make fun of my niece.  Thank you, Manuel.  You rock.  You guys rock.  All right.  See, that's just it, dressing up as a S&M. 
[00:26:30]  You don't see the big blow-up Garfield dressed up in handcuffs or the gimp thing during the Thanksgiving Day parade.  Yeah.  You don't see the cat in a hat taking one up the chute.  No.  Just a bunch of dumbbells wearing little turkey hats.  Right.  Gobble, gobble, gobble.  You're a stitch.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  People are getting hit with light posts, but nothing bad.  Gay people got to bring out every facet of the, you know, something should be kept quiet.  It's okay if you do it, but just don't cause a ruckus about it. 
[00:27:00]  No ruckus.  I mean, you can only have pride in something that you choose, right?  And then gay people are always saying, well, being gay is not a choice.  You're born with it, so make up your mind.  How about, like, stockbrokers?  Gay stockbrokers walking behind the banner in their suits, you know?  Hey, we're gay, but, you know, we're in the system, and we're stockbrokers, and gay secretaries can go through it, and whatever.  But it's got to be just this rolling, filthy bed with two guys slamming on it dressed as chicks.  Like, what the...  There's children. 
[00:27:30]  Straight people are awful not wanting us to teach their kids.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Ho-cha, ho-cha.  Got the NYPD check there.  Do you think that that has any influence on it?  Hey.  Mighty.  Mike, what's up?  Idiots.  Mikey.  What's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Let's go.  A few years ago, I was working the gay pride parade, and it was a long day.  We were out there from, like, 8 o'clock in the morning until, like, 11 o'clock at night.  And one of the flames came over and was all pissed off that we had closed off the street.  So he's yelling at us.  I gave him a dirty look.  And then he goes, oh, what's the matter? 
[00:28:00]  Talk to me man-to-man.  My partner had to pull me away before I ripped his throat out.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, you guys.  No tolerance with the NYPD.  You hate it.  You guys need to go to some tolerance classes.  No, they don't.  The NYPD is fine.  No tolerance classes.  It's so funny to watch the cops on the parade route.  And they're just looking like, oh, Jesus Christ.  Psycho Tim.  Gentlemen, what's up? 
[00:28:30]  What's up, Timmy?  Just to call it what I was saying.  The faggots in Boston, they moved into this ghetto.  It's called the South End now, which is, like, very cheap.  But ten years ago, you've walked.  They carjacked you.  You get stabbed in the throat.  The fags moved in, and the gangs moved out.  Really?  The fags pushed the gangs out.  The fags.  The fags cut rid of them all.  The place is clean now.  There's big little flowers there.  And you can actually walk to the street without getting killed.  You might get hit on, but...  When you're a fag, you're a fag all the way. 
[00:29:00]  From your first D in your mouth to the last D in your A.  I just love how Boston tells it, man.  Yeah, Boston's not like, well, the gay community moved into it.  And the fags came in and pushed the niggas out.  That's pretty much what he's saying.  Thank you, Mr. Mayor.  Exactly.  All right, Tim.  See you later, sweetie.  All right, Angel Toast.  Friggin' Boston, man.  Yeah, the fags took over.  That neighborhood.  But, man, their streets look really good, man. 
[00:29:30]  They do little flower pots and all neat.  And they clean up the dog poop.  No graffiti.  No muggings.  It's great.  Yeah, well, you know, maybe you want to move in.  All right.  A lot of people checking in, Anthony.  We've got to take a break, but it looks like a lot of people checked out the festivities yesterday.  Yes.  So we'll go to you guys in just a bit.  I'm not a doctor, but I do sound like one.  And I'd like to tell you about a condition plaguing the Opie and Anthony Best Wow Contest.  It's called Not Hot Enough, Sis.

We're a very interactive radio show.  866-277-4WOW.  I'm hearing there's a guy on the line that got very injured. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, no.  The Gay Pride Parade.  I was very injured at the Gay Pride Parade.  Yesterday, huh?  Oh.  So what happened to you?  Well, I went down there because it was for Gay Pride.  Yeah.  But I thought Gay was happy.  Like in the Flintstones song, we'll have a gay old time.  So you thought just it would be very fast that people would be just having a happy time. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, I was wrong.  Yeah?  Boy, the weather yesterday with the Triple H's.  What do you mean the Triple H's?  Hazy, hot, and homo.  Oh, fuck.  I didn't know.  Oh.  I wanted to march in the parade.  Yeah?  So I just joined in.  Uh-huh.  And a young man said, march in front of me.  I'll bring up your rear.  And, oh, he did.  Oh.  And I started chanting with the rest of them. 
[00:41:30]  Because I didn't know.  We're here.  We're queer.  We're fabulous.  Get used to us.  We're here.  We're queer.  We're...  Oh.  That didn't go over too well.  No.  Then I went on one of the rides they had set up.  What do you mean they had rides at the Gay Pride Parade?  Richard Gere's Tunnel of Terror.  Oh.  Oh.  It's like a slide, but you dress up like a gerbil.  Oh, shit.  And slide in.  And I was banged about on some faux intestines. 
[00:42:00]  Oh.  Oh.  And I had just gotten back from England.  Yeah?  So I got used to calling cigarettes fags.  Okay.  So I was going around going, hey, give me a fag.  I need a fag in my mouth now.  I said, look, I'm dying for a nice big fag to suck on.  And all of a sudden this grown man puts his stuff in my face.  Oh. 
[00:42:30]  Oh.  Well.  I could imagine my shock.  Yeah.  How was it?  I was suing for that.  Oh.  So I ducked out into a bar.  All the stools were upside down.  That old gag.  But I did find some lovely ladies in there.  Oh, ladies?  Ladies at the gay pride parade, huh?  Well, I'm quite the stud.  I was making time with them.  Uh-huh.  And making out at the bar.  Oh, yeah.  This poor girl, though.  She had something in her throat. 
[00:43:00]  Why?  That she couldn't swallow because it was making a lump in front.  Ah!  I was going at it.  That was a dude.  Oh.  Because then I saw something twitching in her dress.  So I picked up a bottle and hit it.  And she punched me.  I thought it was a rat.  Oh.  Then some man asked if he could push in my stool for me.  That old gag.  So I ran out of there and caught the parade. 
[00:43:30]  More of the parade.  Yeah.  I saw the baton twirlers.  Yeah.  They were spinning the batons.  But you should see how they catch these things.  How do they catch them?  Well, put it this way.  They could do a handstand and catch it.  Because that's what they were doing.  Oh.  All I know is I maybe had too much to drink.  And I woke up dressed as the Indian from the village people.  With my ass burning.  In a place called the Piledriver. 
[00:44:00]  Oh.  So I'm suing all involved.  I'm very injured.  All right.  I can't sit down.  God damn it.  All right.  Well, I'm sorry to hear that you got injured at the gay pride parade.  There he goes.  Very nice.  Lisa's on the phone.  She's got a problem, Anthony.  Girl, what happened?  Lisa, what's wrong?  Lisa.  Hello.  Hello.  Did she chicken out?  Lisa's one of the girls in the WOW Contest.  If she's not happy with her pictures. 
[00:44:30]  Let me look.  What number?  And she wants a reshoot.  By the way, we're still qualifying ladies for the WOW Contest.  $5,000 up for grabs.  Courtesy of RisqueVideo.com.  And we had quite a day on Friday.  We had a lot of girls enter the contest.  A lot of girls from Columbus.  We had a few in New York here.  Lisa from who?  From where?  Oh, Lisa probably contested number 57, right?  Because I'm looking at 44 from Dallas.  And she don't need a reshoot.  It's contested number 57, Lisa.  All right.  Let me take a look. 
[00:45:00]  Columbus.  Oh, her.  I wish she would call back.  I want to know what she thinks is wrong with her pictures.  She's in it.  Oh, stop, Rick.  You were the one that took the pictures.  Yeah.  Well, I can do.  All right.  Hopefully she'll call back.  Maybe it was Opie's Moose Nose comment.  Oh, sorry, Opie.  Jeez, how did that slip out?  We are in vacation, though.  All right.  We're not going to look after each other today, huh?  No one's going to be looking after their pals today. 
[00:45:30]  I see where this is going.  I'm okay with that.  Every man for themselves from here until 7 o'clock tomorrow.  Ouch.  Sheep Lutter from Jersey.  Hardcore was on last night.  Oh, yeah.  Like at 145 a.m.  Damn, that movie is funny.  That movie is not supposed to be funny, but it really is funny.  I watched it myself last night on Encore.  And as I'm watching, and he's, well, you know, it's George C. Scott. 
[00:46:00]  His daughter runs off while she's at some church retreat in California.  He's from Michigan.  And she runs off and disappears.  And all of a sudden, the private detective, what's his name?  Peter Boyle?  Peter Boyle finds a little 8-millimeter tape.  And he goes to a porno theater that he's, I guess his buddy gave him the key for,  so he could give George C. Scott a private screening of his daughter getting double teamed  by a couple of these fag 70s porno guys. 
[00:46:30]  I think it was San Francisco, right?  No, at that point, wasn't it the seedy underbelly of San Francisco that she ended up in?  No, I thought that, too.  She ended up in San Diego, and then they went up to San Francisco.  But the film was showed to him in Michigan.  He actually found a porno theater in Michigan to show him the screening.  You won't say the ending, wait, because I haven't seen it in a long time.  I actually forgot the ending.  Really?  Yeah, I'll leave if you're going to say the ending.  Well, I think he finds his daughter, Jim. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, it's one of those, you know, I won't tell you how or where or what, but, you know.  I don't even remember, but I would assume that he finds her, right?  I just like how he has to get into that seedy underworld, and he's going into peep shows,  and these are places where you get body-to-body contact for $20 a half hour, $30 for an hour.  Tips are accepted by the girls.  They gave him the same line every time.  Bank of Mericard is accepted.  Bank of Mericard.  Bank of Mericard.  Oh, man.  And all I was thinking as I'm doing this is, like, this whole place he was walking to 
[00:47:30]  was amazing.  Both sides of the street, porno everywhere throughout this whole city.  I'm just, this is Nortonville.  I was thinking, this would be the city if Norton was the mayor.  Everywhere you walked, it was just smoke.  Why are you surprised?  That's how Times Square used to be.  I know, how soon you forget.  When we used to come in when we were in high school from a long time.  When it rocked.  But when he's got to stand there, he's trying to find his daughter, so he portrays the movie  producer, trying to cast a movie. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, he's getting a porno together.  And he was in a seedy, what, motel?  He was in some seedy motel.  He put an ad in a paper, and he starts getting people responding, because he's waiting for  the guy to come in that was in the film with his daughter.  And, uh, uh, the big black guy comes in first.  It's, uh, I'm big dick black.  Big dick black comes in.  And then, uh, he realizes right away that, well, that the two guys that were railing my  daughter were white, so he doesn't need them.  So he doesn't need, uh, big dick black anymore.  Sorry, Mr. Black, uh, you're not our type. 
[00:48:30]  You don't want to hire any niggas, that's all.  No, it's not that.  And he's got to explain a big dick black, and a big dick black just goes on to describe  himself.  Yeah.  I'm nine inches long.  Yeah.  I could stay all night.  Yeah.  Oh, you got it?  Is it bleeped?  Yeah.  I hope so, because he's radio-friendly.  He gets really, uh, funny with this one.  And he's just got to sit there as this black guy yells at him.  Lisa's pissed off she didn't want to go on air.  Hey!  Lisa!  Lisa!  Lisa! 
[00:49:00]  It says pissed off, don't want to go on air.  Then why are you calling us there?  Why are women so temperamental and picky?  Lisa's very pissed.  She just wants to come in and do a reshoot.  Oh, boy.  And, uh, also we'll just throw the new pictures up there and no one will notice.  So, how about do a reshoot?  All right, Lisa, because you don't want to talk to us on air, just come down and we'll  reshoot you, okay?  My junk has to be in the reshoot, though.  All right, Anthony, here's, uh, here's the whole line.  I'm Dick Black.  You're doing a porno movie, right?  Right. 
[00:49:30]  Then I'm the man for you.  Well, I'm glad to meet you, Mr. Black, but I'm afraid you're not exactly the type we're  looking for.  You mean because I'm black?  No, he's just not the type.  What do you mean, not the type?  Man, don't you know who I am?  I'm Big Dick Black.  I've done more porno movies than you ever saw.  I work with Harry Reams, Johnny Y.  Not the type?  I can f*** ten times a day.  I can keep it hard for two hours at a time.  I'm a woman's dream.  I got a d*** hung on me nine inches long. 
[00:50:00]  I'm sorry, Mr. Black.  I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I just don't have anything for you.  If something comes up, I'll be happy to give you a call.  S***.  You don't want to hire any niggas, that's all.  I knew this was a scam.  This is bulls***.  And there goes Big Dick Black.  And he walks out all angry.  It's so great when you watch those movies, though, and a clip from this show pops up because  I just sit there laughing.  Oh, that's from the show.  Yeah, he used to be one of the cops on Sanford and Son.  Just to hear a guy telling Patton the size of his mule is really funny. 
[00:50:30]  Well, not only telling, another guy came in, this real gay guy, this blonde gay guy.  He walks in, and again, George C. Scott realizes it's not the guy.  Did he have the 70s gay porno mustache?  No, he was like a younger gay guy.  So he had the blonde hair, but no mustache.  Much too young, no body hair.  And he disgusted me.  Blonde?  Was he blonde?  He was blonde.  Uh-huh.  He takes a glance at Opie.  He came and he realizes that it's not the guy. 
[00:51:00]  So the guy gives him his resume, which is just a porno magazine full of pictures.  And he goes, all right, we'll get back to you.  Thank you.  We have your contact number.  He goes, well, don't you want to see my stuff?  And George C. Scott now is just, his head is down.  He goes, all right.  And they do the camera shot between his legs, like right between the gay guy's legs from the back.  So you can see George C. Scott sitting on the couch, but it's from between his legs.  And he pulls his pants on.  And you just see George C. Scott's face go, all right, great. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, let me say something like that.  That'll be enough.  No, he goes, that's very nice.  He didn't say that, did he?  He did.  Very nice.  Yeah, yeah.  Great, great.  Go, go, go.  That is such a great movie.  Really is.  And then, of course.  Just because of George C. Scott.  And it's just, it's funny.  It really, and the kicker, that scene where he's in the movie theater watching his daughter.  And he just, he loses his effing mind.  Do we have that one?  Yeah.  Because that's one of our favorites.  I had it up here. 
[00:52:00]  Listen, and to see him grabbing the backs of the seats in front of him and shaking him.  Turn it off!  As his daughter's tag team and two guys.  You can hear the movie, obviously, playing.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off!  Turn it off! 
[00:52:30]  Turn it off!  You really feel for the guy.  It was so sick, man.  When the movie starts out, it's his daughter, and he sees her sitting on a bed, and she's  got her clothes on, and he looks like, oh my God, that's her.  That's definitely her, yeah.  And where's this going?  Because he don't know.  He's a religious guy. 
[00:53:00]  He's a Bible thumper, man.  He hasn't seen stuff like this.  But then this really gay-looking guy walks over to her and takes her shirt off, and her  little boobies are there, you know, because she's supposed to be underage, but I guess  they just got a 21-year-old girl that kind of looked very young.  And they pull the shirt off, and then he looks like, oh my, oh no.  Oh no.  They get her on all fours, and she starts, you know, doing to the guy in front of her  while she's on all fours, and his face just, like, goes blank. 
[00:53:30]  And then the worst part, that's when he started saying, turn it off.  You see the other guy behind her pull the panties down, and there's her bare ass, and he starts  going to town, and that's where he lost his mind.  Turn it off!  I didn't mind watching the Hummer, though.  No, no.  No.  Ah, Bruce, what's going on?  Hey, listen, guys, I saw that last night.  It's ironic.  I was up that time of night, but hey, the funniest thing in the whole damn thing was the collar 
[00:54:00]  on that shirt that he had when he was with that young girl looking for his daughter.  The collar was like a hang glider on his shirt.  It was incredible, right?  It was big, wide, 70s lapels on the jackets and on the shirts.  Nice print, nice print, too, all right?  Classic.  He got those jeans with the design on the back, on the pockets, and around the...  It wasn't Sassoon Sasol, and the shirt, the multicolored shirt, and then he put that wig on and the  big 70s porno mustache.  I'm casting a pornographic movie.

I think this is the week where everyone just says, ah, screw it. 
[01:06:00]  Well Hung is saying, hint to Rick when he takes pictures of the WOW Contest girls.  Long hair, which goes behind the body, should not be allowed to fall behind the armpits.  I've seen a couple of these where the girls have their arms up, they got long hair, and it looks like they have armpit hair.  So maybe Mr. Rick can take care of that.

Oh, it's, oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were telling us.  Am I the only one that speaks wheelchair Fred these days?  I thought he said F-U. 
[01:07:00]  What happened to your ears, Anthony?  I don't know.  Thank you.  Yeah, all right, you want to thank us for what?  Because he gave me the nickname wheelchair Fred seven years ago.  We, something, something.  He gave me the nickname wheelchair Fred.  Oh.  Oh, we gave you the, all right, the nickname wheelchair Fred many years ago.  But on the air, he's going to do a wheelchair Fred and I should.  And how's it working out for you?  Well, for that, you like a button like a doll. 
[01:07:30]  It's like I'm famous, don't you know?  Oh, because they made you famous.  Yeah.  And that's why you're thanking us today?  Yeah.  I met a girl the other night.  You met a girl the other night?  Whoa.  I heard that.  No, nothing happened to her.  She's a very nice girl.  Nothing happened.  She's a very nice girl.  And how did you, how did you...  She was just talking and she totally, she was totally accepting of me. 
[01:08:00]  She was totally accepting of you?  She didn't understand how she was going to be bi.  Is she like the blind girl from Mask?  I don't know, baby.  That he's bi.  That he's bi.  Oh, really?  You're officially saying that you're bi now, Fred?  I guess so.  Well, how do you say it?  Yeah, I guess if you suck a D, that puts you right in that category.  Yeah.  It only takes one. 
[01:08:30]  It only takes one.  I did it once.  You only did it once.  It doesn't matter.  Right.  Fred.  Fred.  Yeah, what?  How did you meet this girl?  Was it because you're wheelchair Fred and she knows that?  Yeah.  Oh, and she was being all cold to you?  What happened?  You were at a bar?  Yeah, the bar.  The chicken bone.  The chicken bone over there in Framingham.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where I live.  All right. 
[01:09:00]  And...  I take the fireworks around here.  And like...  You don't want to ignore me.  Except for you guys, you're weird.  Okay, I'm lost on that one.  I really...  I didn't get one word.  Yeah.  Most people ignore me.  Oh, most people ignore you, but the...  But you guys are so weird.  You guys are so weird?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's us.  Why?  Yeah, don't blame us because they're ignoring your... 
[01:09:30]  Your...  Your mutant body.  Thank you.  You guys are weird.  They're trying to ignore me.  Now, what happened?  Did she come up to you and she heard you talking or something?  How did she approach you?  No, she's at the bar.  And you went up to her?  And I went up to the bar.  She said, no wheelchair, Fred.  And I just said, no, but...  You what?  I said, no kidding.  You said, I'm not wheelchair, Fred.  I'm just kidding? 
[01:10:00]  What?  She said, are you wheelchair, Fred?  Uh-huh.  Are you really wheelchair, Fred?  Duh.  I said, no, I say, but...  Gee.  It's not like people are dressing up as wheelchair, Fred, and going to bars to get laid.  No, I'm Stephen Hawking.  The universe is going to end.  Let me talk to you about quantum physics.  Well, I...  Do you want to get into my black hole? 
[01:10:30]  Oh, many men have been there.  I'm an expert on your radios.  Can I get serious?  Can you get serious?  Yeah.  It's impossible without voice.  But try it.  Go ahead.  No, it's true.  Go ahead.  Try to get serious.  Let me try.  All right.  Are you going to cry?  No.  Uh-oh.  Do you know how those people talk about being prejudiced? 
[01:11:00]  You know how what?  All these people, all these black people going to use prejudice towards the point.  Prejudice?  That black people use prejudice as what?  I think the fact that people want prejudice towards the black are Chinese.  I heard Chinese, too.  I think the blacks are warring with the Chinese.  Oh, my God.  Run to your shelters.  No.  People want prejudice towards them. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, towards blacks and Chinese.  Okay.  And I'm trying to do that prejudice towards the handicapped people.  Oh, there's handicapped prejudice, too, there, Fred, right?  Yeah.  How does that affect...  How does that affect...  Well, now, I know, like, black people might go into a store and they'll be followed around  because people will assume that they're going to steal something.  How are you affected by handicapped racism or prejudice, Fred? 
[01:12:00]  Well, for instance, I was in the back of the day with somebody else.  You guys get it.  I was in the bank with somebody else.  And the teller took it right over my head to the other person.  She couldn't see you.  Wait, wait, wait.  What did he say?  He said that he was in the bank with someone else and the teller looked right over his head  and took the other person in line.  That's not prejudice.  She just couldn't see you.  She couldn't see you, Fred. 
[01:12:30]  You're in a wheelchair.  You've got to get a little hunky horn so they know how to look down at you.  Fred, get a stick with a picture of your face on it.  Fred, get a stick.  Put your face on it and then you can raise it up to eye level with her  and make a little string so the mouth can move and go,  Hello, this is wheelchair, Fred.  I'm down here.  I'm down here.  Or a big stick with an arrow.  Yeah.  Like my boyfriend, I want to make a deposit.  Yeah, please.  In the bank of my butt. 
[01:13:00]  Just don't take the money and throw it on her back.  Yeah, I'll make you have a device on it.  I will be making a withdrawal.  Now, Fred, that's not racist.  I'm going to be retarded because I'm going to be this.  Yeah, everyone thinks he's retarded because he talks like that, but you're not retarded.  Not at all.  No.  Man, what a hell he is in.  What an effing hell he is in. 
[01:13:30]  People think he's retarded.  You know, when we go up to Boston later on this summer,  I think we've got to do wheelchair Fred Cribs.  We've got to see how he lives.  Oh, yeah.  That I want to see.  All right, what else, Fred?  When you come to Boston, you're going to be broadcasting from BCN Show.  We're going to be broadcasting from the Sam Adams Brewery later on this summer.  Hey, you've got to invite me to go down there.  We'll invite you there.  No problem.  I'll raise him around there.  I can't give up.  All right. 
[01:14:00]  Well, Fred, I think we're going to let you go.  Okay.  Thank you.  Hey, Fred, real quick.  Did you get the girl's number?  No.  She wasn't my type of girl.  She had short hair.  She's not your type of girl.  She's got short hair.  Yet you...  I'm too goddamn picky.  Oh, that's smart.  Wait a minute.  Wait, wait.  Hey, Fred, you had a guy do you.  You had a man do you because you can't get girls, but you're being picky with the girls?  Yeah.  Fred, she's got the right part. 
[01:14:30]  Go for it.  I think you're gay.  Dude.  I think you're totally gay.  If you had a girl, but her hair wasn't to your liking, so you didn't pursue it, yet you bent over for a man.  Well, I don't want to ruin things with her.  I'll meet her again.  What?  I don't want to ruin things with her.  I may meet her up again.  Oh, he doesn't want to ruin things.  You might meet up with her again.  Yeah, I'll be there. 
[01:15:00]  Hold on.  You know what?  Because he's a guy just like all of us.  Fred, what was the problem with this girl?  Because she had really short hair.  Oh, you didn't like her very short hair?  It was my mother.  She reminded you of your mother.  Yeah, my mother's short hair.  Well, just put a wig on her.  Yeah, don't worry about it, reminding it.  Like I said, you bent over and another man did you.  Yeah.  Perhaps you should set your sights a little lower as far as girls go. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, why don't you get back to batting for the other side there.  And then you can work, you know, you start with the girl with the short hair, and then  maybe you get someone a little better next time.  Maybe.  Well, I'll give you a chance.  All right.  I'll be back at the chicken bone in two weeks.  He'll what?  Oh, he'll be back at the bar at the chicken bone.  In two weeks.  In two weeks.  It takes that long for him to get there, so he's leaving now, and he'll be there in two weeks.  Fred, why does it take you so long to get back to the bar? 
[01:16:00]  What do you have to do?  I'm going to see Rush next week in two weeks.  He's going to see Rush in two weeks.  On the front seat, and then I go to the house next day.  You know, wheelchair Fred, if I was in your position, I'd be at the bar every night.  Yeah.  Oh, I get sick, though.  You get sick, though?  No, I'm from a medication, no booze with pills. 
[01:16:30]  Whoa.  What kind of medication?  This guy's a classic, by the way.  Hold on, hold on, Fred, hold on.  When we used to live in Massachusetts and stuff, if he didn't get a ride, he would just wheel down Route 9 on his wheelchair.  Oh, yeah.  After drinking all night, Ben.  The guy was a classic.  And those scumbags up there, no one would pick them up.  And he's just in a wheelchair in the middle of the night, just wheeling along. 
[01:17:00]  He would use whatever cash he had to get to an event.  He'd take a cab to the place, but have no money left over.  We'd give him drinks and everything.  And then he'd try to get a ride home.  No one would take him home.  Everyone would bolt.  And he'd be outside the venue.  And then you'd just see him pull out of the parking lot on his wheelchair.  And just, there's the back of Fred's wheelchair heading down the highway.  On Route 9.  In winter.  Yeah, in the winter. 
[01:17:30]  Didn't matter.  All right, Fred, what else?  What else were you going to say, Fred?  I didn't give you plenty of rides, you know that.  I hope he took you home a few times.  Yeah, I know, but I have to do it.  And then he'd hit me up for money every time, too.  And the VCR.  And back then, we were making no money.  No.  Fred, look, I'm not doing much better than you.  You ever pull him out of his chair when you got him home and throw him over the pedal?  No, it was just that.  No, darn it. 
[01:18:00]  Anthony, are you still married?  Hell no.  I have an ex-wife of yours who's real haughty.  What'd he say?  Ex-wife of yours who's real haughty.  Oh, there you go.  Yes, you're over her.  I'd rather put up with your speech.  Oh, too bad.  Yeah.  That's okay, Fred.  I'm fine with it, believe me.  All right, Fred.  We're going to let you go. 
[01:18:30]  Thank you for caring.  Okay.  Anything else you want to say today?  You can't.  You can't say anything.  I can't.  What?  I don't say.  I can't.  What?  Go for it.  What?  The Gay Pride Parade.  Go for it.  Oh, the Gay Pride Parade.  Go for it.  Oh, you should have been there.  Yeah.  Imagine all the guys you could have gotten that night.  You know what?  If you were down here for the Gay Pride Parade, you'd be the only gay guy not getting laid 
[01:19:00]  that night.  Probably right.  Just throw him down on the grass somewhere, his legs all bent up.  Turnip root-ish.  Fred would star in a Bukkake film.  He'd just lay in the middle of Broadway, just all messed up.  Hey, what happened?  Did a flock of pigeons attack him? 
[01:19:30]  Look at the twisty feet on that statue.  All right, Fred.  We'll talk to you soon, all right?  Go for it.  Hey, you know, some advice from your pals, O&A.  You know, you should have went for the short-haired girl.  Yeah.  You've got to start somewhere.  Oh, I don't want to do the ice.  It sure beats man-butt.  I was super-hired.  What?  I've been doing it for two years.  All right, I don't know what that is.  I've been doing it myself. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, he does himself now.  For two years.  Oh, you haven't done the man-butt thing in two years?  Yeah, I'm the girl.  You're still healing.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Tight.  Yeah.  All right, Fred.  Give us your catchphrase.  I'm not getting a distance.  That's right.  Okay.  And my second favorite, you've got to do I'm not an animal.  I'm not an animal.  All right.  Wheelchair, Fred.  Thank you. 
[01:20:30]  Okay.  Thank you, fellas.  Bye.  All right.  There you go.  Bye, Anglespine.  Thank you, fellas.  Fellas.  Hey, fella.  Bend the old fur.  Fella.  Keith, what's going on?  Yo, doesn't he sound like Arnold Schwarzenegger after he had a stroke?  Like, he's a man.  He's a man.  Ah.  Dylan.  Get to the chopper.  Oh. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, God.  Yeah, look at Jesse on line one.  What?  He's got a valid point.  Let's go to Jesse.  Yeah.  What's up, man?  Duffy, but either way.  Oh.  Yo, Anthony, you just got pity for your divorce from a guy who can't walk or speak.  Yeah, I know.  How sad is that?  Yo, man, I'm never getting married.  Screw that, yo.  All right, Jesse.  Peace.  Hey.  He brings up a valid point.  Let's go to Mark.  What's up, Mark?  Mark.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, it's nice to be back up here in Boston to hear you guys. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, thanks, Mark.  Hey, listen.  I went to a CD signing for you guys at the Tower Records, right?  Yeah.  For that domestic girl?  Yeah.  Yep.  I was going through.  I'm waiting.  And you guys signed and stopped.  So, again, I'm like, all right.  Hey.  Oh, you're breaking up.  Oh, you're breaking up.  Oh, you're breaking up.  I know what he's going to say.  We invited Wheelchair Fred to one of our CD signings.  He held up the line for hours because no one had the balls to tell the guy, look, why  don't you just, like, kind of nod at the listeners?  It took him, it took him, like, five minutes per call. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, yeah.  And it still looked like nothing, but no one had the balls to go, wow, maybe this wasn't  a good idea.  He actually stopped riding wheelchair.  He used to write W.C. Fred.  Right.  W.C. Fred.  And he'd write W.C. Fred, but it took forever.  And the people would wait on line, and I would sign it, Opie would sign it, and they'd feel  bad, they would want to walk away, because they really didn't even want Fred's signature. 
[01:22:30]  But they felt guilty, so they'd put the stuff down in front of him and go, okay, W.  That's why the CD sold so well, because Fred would wreck their CD, and they'd go buy another  one.  They'd have to buy another one.  People would go, who's Water Closet Fred?  Fred.  Lenny, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I was just thinking, I know you guys did a thing a while ago with that guy, the Gimp.  Yeah.  And have a phrase, and guess what he says. 
[01:23:00]  I think that would be perfect.  Yeah, we're going to.  To do it with wheelchair Fred.  I think we're going to bring that bit back.  That's not a bad idea.  All right.  All right, Lenny, thank you.  You guys have a good vacation.  Hey.  All right, man.  We're only taking a few days.  Well, enjoy.  Nothing too major.  Thanks, bro.  All right.  Bye, Len.  Hey, Justin, what's going on?  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Yo, I heard you guys saying you were coming to the St. Mounds Brewery.  Is that true?  Yeah, sometime in August.  Yeah?  Yeah, what happens is about, I don't know, 30 or 40 radio stations are there, and we're 
[01:23:30]  all broadcasting at the same time.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  Last time we did this, we almost got in a fight.  We made Darvin Conger cry.  We got other radio stations high when they thought they were smoking some of that hookah,  whatever it's called.  The hookah.  Yeah, Jim Cook brings out a hookah.  Yeah, we got to bring some of the law girls down there, too.  It was...  Contest.  We took over the whole brewery.  I mean, like I said, it was for like 30 radio stations, but I mean, we took over the  whole place.  Wasn't that when Sankamark was with us?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he was the one that had the weed. 
[01:24:00]  He got fired that day.  Oh, it was that day.  We finally got the phone call that said he was fired.  Phone call?  Well, he got fired long distance.  Yeah, long distance.  Is the thirdly truck driver going to be there, too?  Yeah, I think so.  Unless it's August 10th, because I'm doing Red Bank, New Jersey.  Count Basie Theater.  Oh, my God.  All right, dude.  You got to stop by there anyway.  Come on.  All right.  I hope they let everyone in there.  I don't know how they're working this year, Justin.  So, you'll have to wait for details, okay?  Dude, I'm going to camp out. 
[01:24:30]  I don't care.  Whatever it takes, man.  All right, cool.  We'll see you up there.  All right, later.  All right, baby girl.  We got to start the Sex for Sam 3, because that's how we get people to come with us to  Boston for the two, three-day trip.  Right.  We'll have details on that after the Fourth of July holiday, all right?  Opie, we have what I would consider a real contender here on the WOW Contest.  They just put Dewey up.  Dewey?  Dewey's a dude.  No, Dewey is number 60.  But look at the cans. 
[01:25:00]  Those are, like, pretty good.  Oh, she came in Friday.  This girl's beautiful.  Sexy.  Look at those cans.  Those are beautiful, and those are natural.  Natural, and the shape is just the perfect beauty shape.  Let me remind everyone out there, we had a lot of breast implants last time we did this.  Mm-hmm.  And the girl that won it had maybe full B's cat.  Yeah.  She had very natural full B's, and she won the whole damn thing.  Yeah.  So, yeah, I agree with you.  That girl's, wow.  She's solid, and her pictures came out really nice. 
[01:25:30]  Girl has real, look at that one, the last picture in the group.  Uh-huh.  It's like that perfect shape that you want a booby.  They slope so nicely.  Yeah.  This is heavy.  The top should look like a little ski slope from the side, a profile view.  Uh-huh.  And then the bottom should be that lovely, rounded shape.  That's where all the meat should be.  Right.  With the knee pee area.  Oh, yeah.  Just above the equator line. 
[01:26:00]  That is so hot.  Yeah, she's beautiful.  They're like teardrops, Anthony.  Great job.  They call them teardrop boots, right?  Mm-hmm.  Aren't they nice?  Stewie is the latest contestant in the WOW Contest.  Contestant number 60 is up on opandanthony.com.  Ladies, you can still qualify.  All the details are on opandanthony.com.  We got $5,000 up for grabs, and I asked Ethel and the gang around here, we want to sweeten  the pot a little bit.  Sweeten the pot.  We want to get more stuff involved for the grand prize winner.  Are they working on that?  I don't know.  We'll see. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, you put another little thing in that prize, and the girls will come out of the  woodwork.  A little something, something.  Yes.  So opandanthony.com as we continue qualifying for at least another four months.  Terrible at this.  But come on, it's not like every day we're spending hours on this.  Does everybody have their dolls?  Yeah, everyone has their Black Earl dolls.  Look, if nobody knows what Black Earl looks like, you too can have your own Earl action  figure.  All you have to do is go to McDonald's. 
[01:27:00]  They're giving away the Happy Meals that you buy at McDonald's.  They're giving away from Lilo and Stitch, the cartoon, action figures.  And today, I don't know what this character's called.  Does anybody know who this character from the movie Lilo and Stitch is?  It's a black gentleman, dressed in black, and it is Earl.  Yeah, because it has the sunglasses that Earl always wears.  It's Earl's face, Earl's shaved head.  It's Earl. 
[01:27:30]  I mean, I think the people that made this doll, or the character of the movie, looked at the  website, saw Earl, and thought it would be a good joke.  Look, there are about 15 of these things around the studio, right?  We all have our own Earl doll.  When our interns came back with one of the Happy Meals, and we saw one of these things,  everybody just went, go back, go back.  We're handing her money, and she came back with like 20 of these things, and we all have  our own Earl doll.  And Earl is just going to be so happy that all of us have these things. 
[01:28:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, own your own Earl, just like before the Civil War.  You idiots.  Look at his head moves, too.  He goes, I don't know.  I'm doing the public file.  You can make his head move.  I've decided to start talking to you guys.  His name is Cobra Bubbles in the movie?  Well, that's Earl.  Cobra Bubbles.  That's Earl.  This is better than the last cartoon character that we thought looked like Earl.  It's been two weeks, and I'm not mad at you anymore.  I'm ready to talk. 
[01:28:30]  Can we talk?  Look, look, I move his arms.  Give me a hug.  See?  You open his arms up, and he's hugging Earl.  Can't we all just get along?  What's this for?  I don't understand.  I guess he sits on a platform.  Surfboard.  I haven't seen the movie.  Does he surf in his black suit?  Surfboard.  That's a little too much action for Earl.  He's all in black.  He's got the glasses.  It is amazing.  Pick up your own Earl, I guess.  And how racist is that, to have the black guy on a surfboard?  What?  Is it a surfboard?  Maybe a snowboard.  No, it's a surfboard. 
[01:29:00]  Well, snowboard's even worse.  I'm snowboarding.  Yeah, all in the back of the radio.  Hey, Christy was on the line, but she hung up because we went off on a tangent.  The Cleveland girls still wondering how they could get in on the WOW Contest.  Oh, because the place, the location that they were taking the pictures, since they're not  allowed to take pictures in the building the studio is in.  I will be very embarrassed if Cleveland doesn't represent this contest, because we're blowing  up in Cleveland.  It was raided.  Well, the last we heard, they decided to get all the girls to come down to some kind of 
[01:29:30]  strip club in Cleveland, and the day they were supposed to get pictures of girls, the  place got raided.  Yeah.  It got raided.  And that's the last we've heard.  And there's plenty of girls.  They're calling from time to time.  They wanted it on the contest, and they want to know what Cleveland is doing for them.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know what to tell you.  We don't have a line on where they can take pictures?  Hell, don't.  Oh, Ben, they're working on it.  Hell, drive down to New York if you have to.  We'll take them here.  How annoying that that stupid person in Cleveland won't allow them to take pictures in the 
[01:30:00]  building.  All right, I got to go blow some more air, so.  Are you gassing all day?  Oh, my God.  Just drop me in the studio.  Who cares?  Ah, come on.  Toughen up.  Al is saying, if it's Earl, it's an inaction figure.  You have to say blow air.  It's a lack of action figure.  That's really funny.  No batteries included, because you don't need them.  Yeah, it doesn't do anything.  All this does is its head moves back and forth. 
[01:30:30]  This is perfect.  And he even has the same Earl pout.  Yeah, he's all like, hmm.  Well, we piss off Earl.  This is exactly how he looks.  He really looks like Earl.  Guys, I'm offended.  I'm not going to talk for three weeks now.  I don't care, Earl.  What is that?  Boy, I really care that you're not talking to me.  What is the black thing behind it that you put your finger?  It looked like little sunglasses.  Steve told me that's to push to.  Oh, God.  God, that is disgusting, man.  Hear that sound? 
[01:31:00]  That's going to smell like spoiled meat.  I just picture a pouty bottom lip going.  All right.  Unlucky lottery and sucks to be you when we come back.  What makes Magna's Irish Hard Cider so special? 
[01:31:30]  In a word, originality, which is something the Irish have always had in common with America.  Take sports, for example.  You've got original games like baseball and football.  We've got hurling and gating.  Sports we're proud of.  Sports that make us who we are.  And when we built up a thirst, I mean a real back of the throat, 
[01:32:00]  just scored the winning point in the All-Ireland Final game in the thirst,  we need something original to quench it.  And there's nothing better than Magna's Irish Saga.  Ireland's original Hard Cider.  Created by William Magna to give the Irish people a unique kind of refreshment.  Because let's face it, there's no thirst like an Irish thirst.  Magna's Irish Saga.

Energy boundaries and biorhythmic fluctuations can make it difficult to maintain a baseline rating of muscular contraction  and more transmissible impulses, of course.  You need the oxymoronuclear acidity and orbital phases.  Now, it's reasonable fluctuations can result in a fibroalgic Red Bull type of situational relevance as well.

They hired world's strongman runner-up for Naz Fardust to crush a full-sized keg to keg can's size with his bare hands.  I can't do it.  I can't do it.  I can't do it.  I can't do it. 
[01:38:00]  Theory number 15.  They put a full-sized keg in ice water, hoping it would shrivel.  Did it shrivel?  Yeah.  Look.  I meant the keg.  It's cute, though.  Theory number 8.  They humiliated a full-sized keg and made it feel small.  You're pathetic.  You're weak.  You are nothing.  Look at that waistline.  You're just a big, fat, porky keg.  Take this. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, there goes the big toe.  The one-of-a-kind Heineken keg can.  How did they do that?  Imported by Heineken USA, White Plains, New York.  Come streaking, streaking with me.

What'd you have in mind?  Thought I'd take you to dinner.  Spend no more than 50 bucks and weasel my way back to your place for a little hanky-panky.  Great.  After dinner, I'll play hard to get, but don't get discouraged.  I do want you to spend the night.  Oh, well, in that case, let's just blow off dinner so I can save some cash.  Perfect.  I don't like fooling around when I'm full anyway.  See you Saturday.  Now then, isn't real refreshing? 
[01:40:30]  Brought to you by the real refreshing taste of Lipton iced tea in a bottle.  Because Lipton is real, and real is refreshing.  And we're back with the O&A show.  A bunch of people calling in with their own version of sucks to be you, Anthony.  Yes.  I thought we were just going to read one of these stories, but it seems like there's a few of them out there. 
[01:41:00]  Jason, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, O&A?  How you guys doing?  Pretty good, man.  Oh, man.  I got this great sucks to be you story for you guys.  I was at a bar back in October just after I turned 21.  Feeling pathetic about myself.  I am completely and utterly obliterated.  I'm down 80 bucks in alcohol.  The next thing I realized, this woman's calling me over to the bar, right? 
[01:41:30]  When this woman calls me over, I'm thinking, oh, this is great.  Maybe I might get a little, you know, as Norton says, hubble, hubble, hubble.  And as soon as I go over there, we're talking and BS it.  Turns out, by the end of the night, I get ready to go home.  Guy knocks on my window.  I tell him I'm too drunk.  I don't want to go back and drink anymore.  Knocks again.  I tell him that again.  Knocks again.  I roll down my window.  Guy says to me, dude, how do you know her?  I go, I just met her at the bar. 
[01:42:00]  Why?  He said, then you don't know.  I look at the guy and say, what?  He goes, dude, that's a dude.  And I'm just there like, oh, sweet, merciful crap.  Good return.  That's it.  Oh, quick.  Over there.  Nice, right?  Oh, dude, it sucks.  Hardcore.  Get in.  Good volley going.  Nice.  Game point.  Oh, damn.  It was horrible. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  Floor.  All right, Jason.  Thank you.  Hey, thank you, guys.  Oh, hey, Norton.  Ah.  Jeez.  You almost had to break out the tennis.  Here's how I knew that story was going to be horrible.  Right from the start.  Second sentence anyway.  Right up to my 21st birthday, which really, that little asterisk and aside had nothing to do with it.  It didn't help the story.  It wasn't informative.  I knew that one was going down. 
[01:43:00]  Jake, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  So, there's this guy, 53 years.  He's a postal worker in Boston.  And he's the statehouse postal worker.  He delivers mail to the governor, all this stuff.  He goes to his retirement ceremony on Friday and collapses and dies at his retirement ceremony.  Hey, that's great.  After working 53 years.  Yep. 
[01:43:30]  53 years for the postal service and he dies at his retirement ceremony.  That's sick.  Life blows.  Hey, I want to bash your old station.  What?  What?  I want to bash your old station for a minute.  Which old station?  Up in Boston.  Oh, okay.  Only because I used to do a radio show myself and I went and applied there.  Uh-huh.  And I used to do morning radio over in Tokyo.  And can I say Dave Dickless?  Is that cool to say?  Of course.  Or you want to leave that up?  Yeah, go ahead.  Sure.  He offered me a street team position.  What a jackass. 
[01:44:00]  You could be part of the street team.  Oh, what an ass.  I say, I can't say, what an ass.  Have some pride.  Anyway.  All right, Jake.  Thanks, man.  Good job.  Wear the giraffe suit.  Have some pride.  Yeah.  Hand out the bumper stickers.  Have some pride.  Have some pride.  Those boys depend on us.  All right, Anthony.  This was the most unbelievable story of the weekend.  Even more unbelievable than the Met that dropped on the ground and started having seizures  after smoking pot after the game. 
[01:44:30]  Got some bad weed.  Oh, yes.  That's a good story, too.  Maybe you shouldn't smoke in the parking lot of the stadium.  Anyway, SUV kills video man at wedding.  Listen to this.  The superhero video man?  Huh?  No.  Oh, I thought there was a superhero and he died when SUV killed him.  Yes.  SUV kills video man.  You told everyone we're in vacation mode, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  The wedding photographer there, Anthony.  Yeah. 
[01:45:00]  Check this out.  A wedding photographer was struck and killed by a sports utility vehicle yesterday as he  was videotaping a couple leaving a Long Island catering hall.  You might be asking yourself.  You may be asking yourself, well, how did this happen?  Yeah.  That he didn't see the SUV coming?  Let me continue.  Umar Kwajaja, 22, was walking backward as he taped the newlywed couple exiting this catering 
[01:45:30]  hall in Hicksville shortly after 2 a.m., Anthony.  Oh, boy.  He stepped off the curb, which should have been a hint that he's walking backward a little  too far.  Now you're in the road.  He stepped off the curb onto Old Country Road and was hit by a Ford Explorer.  Oh.  Old Country Road, very well-traveled road, too.  Yes.  It's not like a little side street that a car might have been passing.  Heavy traffic.  The photographer gets killed by a truck. 
[01:46:00]  The photographer gets killed by a truck.  Hi-ho the Dario.  I wonder if they took out his spleen and she rubbed it on the groom's face and they all  laughed.  Stupid jackass.  What an idiot.  And it goes on to say, this was a joyous occasion that turned to tragedy.  I think it was a boring occasion that turned interesting. 
[01:46:30]  First of all, it's 2 in the morning, stupid.  How do you not see the headlight?  I can see it was 2 in the afternoon.  How does that happen at 2 in the morning?  Wow.  Yeah.  Look at that.  2 in the morning.  So it's after the reception.  Yeah.  At the catering hall.  And they're all stepping out, probably leaving the bride and groom a little sauce themselves.  You know how those weddings go.  And getting that exit shot out of the catering hall, ready to get into their car and go up  to their honeymoon.  I want to see that tape. 
[01:47:00]  Seen at a cemetery.  That's really nice.  I want to see that tape.  I wonder if the wedding couple has to pay for that video.  They're probably all pissed off that they don't get their video.  Oh, here's where it gets all jittery.  Yeah.  Here's the part where the photographer got hit by that explorer.  Yeah.  This might be a little uncomfortable to watch, Mom.  You're watching the dumb couple, and all of a sudden, you're looking up in the air at  a tree in the sky, because, you know.  Like having a fly, yeah.  It's tilted, and you see paramedics.  That's hilarious. 
[01:47:30]  Good.  You have to tolerate that boring chicken dance, and everybody doing the, hey, I'm feeling  hot, hot, hot.  That's the only thing that would have made me happier, is if it would have happened to  an entire conga line of people.  How grand would that have been?  John, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Oh, man, I have this aunt who spent, like, $2,000 on a miniature poodle, looked in the  backyard, a crow frickin' picked it up and flew it away.  Oh, that's great.  I know, man.  Two grand on a dog, and a crow took it?  Crow.  She was down in Florida, in Boca, spent $2,000 on this thing. 
[01:48:00]  Next week, she got another one.  Did she crow-proof it?  That is great.  Norton, you rule.  Thanks, Angel Toast.  My mother put me in charge of her.  Herrick, she had just gotten a kitten.  A little kitten.  It's the first animal she's had in years.  This is going back, I'm talking maybe 15 years ago now.  Before or after the Met thing?  Oh, this is after the Met thing.  Okay.  Thank you for bringing it up, Opie. 
[01:48:30]  You've got to go to that party on the 20th, and Sal's going to be there.  Watch what you say.  Just ask you.  I need a frame of reference.  You're invited.  You're not invited.  You can't come.  I'm sorry, you can't come.  Are you Catholic?  You can't come.  They invited me.  They didn't say nothing about you.  How about you mow my lawn?  Okay.  Then come by the party after.  I ain't even dressed for a party.  Ah?  How did you get crippled? 
[01:49:00]  I slipped on a banana peel.  Hey, you know, John brings up a good point.  John, go ahead.  I'm just curious.  Is it in bad taste to submit that to America's Funniest Home Videos?  Oh, that is hilarious.  You know what?  Ten grand is ten grand.  You know what they should do?  No.  They should put it on cable or a pay-per-view.  How many people would check out, like, you know, America's Home Videos Gone Wrong?  Norton would be number one.  With Bob Saget in there.  Okay, let me back up and get a good picture of the groom.  Oh, no, I'm being killed. 
[01:49:30]  You have the bad voiceover and then the sound effect.  Boing, boing.  Guys, you have a good day.  All right.  Much love, Norton.  Take care, boy.  Thank you.  Boing.  That really is awful.  Wouldn't you watch a show like that, though?  My friend Barry used to do weddings.  He had a wedding photography company or whatever.  He said one time he just stopped at a wedding.  Oh, ho.  You have the bad sound effect.  Doink.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[01:50:00]  We have the worst copy of that song.  Wedding tragedy.  Go ahead.  No, no, I don't want to tell him.  Now, he was filming a wedding one time and he said that the groom and the best man got  into a fist fight in the church.  Oh, that's great.  During the ceremony.  On videotape?  Yeah, I don't know if they have.  I'm sure they did, but that's what they did.  I remember him telling me.  You know, photographers are pains in the asses at the wedding.  They're getting in the way.  They're always in the way.  I was at a wedding recently.  They now have spotlights all over the dance floor.  Yeah.  They did video.  It's like you're taking, I think you're taking away from me the moment. 
[01:50:30]  The pictures always stink, too.  They're all melodramatic and overposed.  Yeah.  Stretch out that whore's dress until it takes up half the lawn.  That's nice.  You married a grandiose C with a big dress.  And I was laughing because we've talked about this on our show.  Yeah.  I was at this wedding and all the bridesmaids, they had their really sexy, you know, dresses.  Wow.  They're starting to figure that out, by the way, for a while.  Oh, are they?  I think so.  With the ridiculous bridesmaid dresses.  You almost could wear it again, the dresses, right?  But once again, there was that one fat girl and she just didn't look, you know, quite the 
[01:51:00]  way the rest of them did.  And then they're friends, so you can tell them not to be in it.  But it does ruin the picture because that's the one that stands out.  And there's always the hot line of chicks and you're like, wow, they look really good.  I mean, it was hot, hot, hot.  Yeah.  And then a fatty with a shawl to cover up.  And none of the other girls had the shawl, but the shawl matched the print of the dress.  It's like, oh.  You know why she's a good listener?  She's the fat confidant who needs to feel important.  So she just sits there with her big Dumbo ears open. 
[01:51:30]  The worst thing is they're all in the same dress.  So you're looking at the hot girl with the nice body and everything.  And then in that same large-sized dress is the fat girl.  Yeah.  Whoa.  You got to invite the C-blocker to your own wedding.  She's C-blocked you your whole goddamn life.  You might as well invite her to the big day.  And the wedding videos are always just awful.  Like, mine?  Whoa.  Oh.  And most of them, yeah, they turn out when you consider the 50% divorce rate in this country, 
[01:52:00]  half those videos are now like just a heinous horror movie for a lot of people.  They just don't want to see it anymore.  I videotaped my brother's wedding.  And you know how that whole marriage turned out.  Lawsuits, felonious assaults, charges.  It was great.  Well, we were all at that wedding knowing it wasn't going to last.  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  Everybody.  Everybody.  Oh.  Oh, you don't even have to.  You're right.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  What a horror show this is.  So then when, when, um, yeah, this last, look at him, he's already checking out the 
[01:52:30]  other girls at the wedding hall.  I was, I was the best man and somebody else was videotaping my brother's wedding and, uh,  they swing the camera around and when they said, uh, is there anybody that wants to speak  now forever hold at peace if, you know, they should be, not be married or something, whatever  the hell that line is.  Uh, the camera was on me and my brother said I looked right into the camera and just gave  the people's eyebrow real slow. 
[01:53:00]  Like my eyebrow just went up like, I wish I could talk.  Oh, I wish.  And my brother made the same face on my video.  Now those are just like horror shows.  I'd rather put in night of the living Ted.  But you were like married in a basement somewhere.  A basement.  No, I got married at a justice of the peace that I was so hoping turned out to be a fraud  and I wasn't really married.  In his living room or something.  Yeah.  Cause that's what he did.  You went there.  I didn't want a big to do to do. 
[01:53:30]  And then, uh, we videotaped that and the reception was held at the bar my mother worked at.  She was, uh, the inn over there in a Comac.  It's now a booby bar.  It's now a topless.  My reception is held in the topless joint.  It is.  Come on.  It's the Carousel East.  Now out on Long Island.  That's where you were?  Yeah.  It used to be called the Inn at the Crossroads.  And it was a local, uh, bar.  A lot of businessmen and some.  And they turned it into the Carousel East.  Isn't that near the Comac Water Inn?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  Right down the road.  Near, uh, Benny's office?  Yep.  Right where, uh, Jericho and Vets split. 
[01:54:00]  And that's exactly where it was.  And that was, uh, where I had my reception.  There is a line between not too big a to-do and reception and strip club.  Well, I know.  Somewhere in the middle you could have figured out.  And then after we left there, I think it was the day of the Preakness.  Is that when May 19th is, Opie?  If I remember the date?  I think so.  Uh, we, we went to the OTB and bet on some horses.  I'm really happy you made it.  See?  Isn't that awful? 
[01:54:30]  You're an ass.  I know.  I was, like, thinking.  I shouldn't have gone through with it at all.  Anyway, um.  The time for getting killed is more romantic.  See how much I wanted it to just be a regular day?  I didn't even want it.  See?  I didn't want to be married.  I just wanted that.  Hey, no, this is a normal day.  I'm going to the strip club and I'm going to OTV.  Speaking of weddings.  Yeah.  Uh, Ben came up with a pretty good idea.  I don't know if anyone will send their tapes in.  But, uh, he was thinking that people should send in tapes of, uh, uh, the best man, uh,  speeches. 
[01:55:00]  Wow, that is good.  Because they are always awful.  They're usually just a cluster F train wreck.  I consider myself pretty good at those.  I gave it at my brother's wedding.  I gave it at, uh, Joe Curry's wedding.  Another wedding.  I gave the, uh, best man speech.  And at Joe Curry's wedding, the, uh, DJ.  You know, they have the DJ, hey, now we're ready for the toes.  Let's get the best man up here.  He hands me the microphone and goes, um, try to keep it a little bit away from your, uh,  face so we get the best sound.  I'm like, you're cool.  I have a microphone every day, you asswipe. 
[01:55:30]  He didn't know.  He didn't know.  I know.  But it was like, don't worry about it there, Sparky.  Did you hear about the one where the guy put the picture of the, the chick having sex  under all the plates?  My brother's cousin was at that wedding.  And, uh, so we, people believe that.  If you want to send in a videotape of, uh, a bad best man speech.  Oh, God, that is great.  Maybe just bad audio from, uh, a wedding.  A bad scene.  One of those bad, you know when the, uh, video photographer comes up to you and goes, would 
[01:56:00]  you like to say a little something to the bride and groom?  And everyone's hammered.  And sometimes they say very inappropriate things.  Those parts, always classic.  They put the camera right in your face.  I was like, I don't know what to say.  I, I, I asked her, um, she sucked in.  I hope she's better now.  Uh, very inappropriate.  It could be fun if there's a little history, you know, whatever, you know, maybe something  crazy happened to that couple and, you know, you're on video wishing them the best.  Good idea.  Look at that, Ben.  We'll run with it. 
[01:56:30]  We'll see what happens.  Yeah, but we've, we come up with this stuff and no one sends in tapes because I, we have  this other great bit that is, it still hasn't happened.  We want a videotape of, uh, of, of women, uh, giving birth and, you know, all the crazy,  crazy stuff they say while they're giving birth to their husbands.  That's a good one too.  But no one has ever sent a tape.  You know, the screaming and yelling, you son of a bitch.  Yeah.  I hate you.  Husband fainting.  Well, we try to get people to send in tapes for that.  Yeah.  No one sent a tape. 
[01:57:00]  Maybe because we don't have something where it's got the address to send it and we play  it ad nauseum.  You know what I mean?  Gotta, you gotta really push that stuff.  I know.  You know, Radio 101, Opie.  I understand.  You know, a lot of people, uh, listen with, uh, no ears.  Well, maybe we could put a little, a little boxy thing up on opianthony.com.  A boxy thing.  Looking for, uh, you know, bad video from weddings and, uh, bad video from the, uh, from the,  uh, maternity ward there.  Look at us on the air figuring out what we should do for our show. 
[01:57:30]  I'm like, today's gonna be different?  I know.  You're too busy installing your 1972 freaking computer monitor instead of show prepping  today.  What the F?  My monitor blew up.  Anthony's, uh, computer monitor, uh, blew today.  So, uh, Scott Colombo in a pinch because, uh, God forbid Anthony goes a day without going  online.  Ha ha ha.  He brings in this monitor.  Am I exaggerating if I tell you it's five feet deep?  Yeah, it's really like deep.  It's, it's right at the end of my desk and it hits the wall. 
[01:58:00]  And I have a pretty wide desk.  It hits the back wall.  This thing, we should get a picture for the website.  It is ridiculous how, how deep this thing goes.  It's got five wires that plug in the back.  And there was a day that this thing was state of the art.  Top notch.  This was it.  Cutting edge.  The, uh, monitor to get.  Two thousand dollar monitor.  Right.  It would have been.  And this thing is just awful.  It can't handle any of the, the system, uh, that I have.  Anthony turns it on and he goes, whoa, I, I feel a tumor, uh, uh, tumor growing already. 
[01:58:30]  Do you hear the sound it made when I turned it on?  It went, whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  It's like magnet.  It's like, I, I don't think that's good.  I, I don't think that's supposed to happen.  You got a lot of mileage out of that old one, but, uh, and that old one was an old one  too.  But I hear it's on order now, so we'll see how long this takes.  But Anthony needed a new monitor today.  I got to play my.  You don't want to piss off Anthony.  I play my games. 
[01:59:00]  That's funny, Anthony.  It's a Twilight Zone reference.  The kid was Anthony and he, everyone was scared.  Okay, Anthony.  Very good, Anthony.  We're having cookies for dinner.  Okay, Anthony.  Good, Anthony.  Here's a bad, uh, sucks to be you wedding to be at.  When a U.S. bomb falls on your, uh, house.  When you're having a wedding in Afghanistan.  They were having a wedding?  Yeah, they were having a wedding. 
[01:59:30]  A U.S. plane bombed a village in central Afghanistan.  Killing at least 30 members of a wedding party.  I'm sorry.  What am I going to say?  What am I going to say?  Good shot.  You know, you got to take the bed with the good with us over there, people in Afghanistan,  for the listening syndication underground.  You got to take the bed with the good.  You wouldn't even be able to have that wedding with the Taliban in there.  See?  Yep.  Am I rationalizing it well?  That sucks.  Let's go to Joe.  Hey, Jeff.  The pride flies apart with 20,000 pieces. 
[02:00:00]  Go ahead, Joe.  What's going on, guys?  I want to know.  Hey, Anthony, at your wedding, did they serve, uh, what kind of boxes of wine did they serve?  Box of wine?  How would you like your box of wine?  Would you like it chilled or warm?  Hey, from the church to the reception, how many lefts did you guys make?  None, because three rice make a left.  Three rice make a left?  It's going to be a long time to get to the reception.  You guys suck.  All right.  Later. 
[02:00:30]  God, uh, the abuse is heading the ant's way all of a sudden.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Anthony, I wanted to know, did you wear a Tostito or a T-shirt with a picture of a Tostito on it?  I think I wore a suit that I, I think I had my communion in.  Did you seem overdressed at the OTB?  It was, uh, yeah, I did seem overdressed at the OTB, and that's about the only place I would have seemed overdressed at.  I was wearing, like, a crappy suit, you know.  I didn't, I was, I was a Baroque. 
[02:01:00]  Baroque.  And, uh, she wore a dress, I don't know where she bought it.  I don't know, it wasn't a wedding dress.  I like Baroque out of it.  I was a Baroque music.  What are you going to say?  I shouldn't have done it.  That was a fine period of music.  The Baroque era.  Uh, Chris, what's going on?  Hey, man, I just wanted to, uh, talk about the, uh, Tostito wedding.  All right.  I had a cousin of mine who had one of those, like, you know, fatal attraction, um, experience, like, relationships with his girlfriend. 
[02:01:30]  Well, they wound up getting married, and she started talking smack to him at the wedding, and he wound up shitting her at the wedding, and they left in separate cars.  But his quote at the end of the night was, I'm not leaving with that fit.  Ironically, they wound up divorced.  Wow.  He hit her right at the reception hall.  Right on.  All right, Ben, relax.  Ben's laughing at visuals.  That's great for radio.  He can't tattle, though.  Okay, uh, we'll break.  The phones are still loaded with, uh, wedding crap.  Wow. 
[02:02:00]  We'll go with it a little longer.  Then we got another, well, no, actually, we got an unlucky lottery to throw at you.  Brutal.  Little taste of justice in there, yeah.  Another stupidity on the way.  Wanted to hit the F.U. line one more time here today?  Yeah.  And we'll continue.  Thanks for calling, and here's the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line.  Yeah, I want to send a big f*** you to my landlord.  Always on my back to late rent.  F*** you, bitch.  I had when I had it.  F*** you.  F*** you.  Next message. 
[02:02:30]  I don't know if you're Mike from South Jersey.  I'd like to give a big f*** you to the people who don't tip your goddamn pizza delivery guy.  We remember who you are.  We spit in your food.  F*** you.  F*** you.  F*** you.  And to the people who send your little f*** head kids to the f*** store because you're too embarrassed not to tip us.  F*** you even harder.  Go f*** yourself.  I hope you all get aged and die.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to give a big f*** you out of my scumbag boss.  Who's making me work on Friday after the 4th of July, you f***ing scumbag. 
[02:03:00]  F***ing f***ing f***ing prick.  Oh yeah, Rick.  F*** you too for that long.  That's nice.  That's what I called.  F*** you guys.  End of messages.

Most about every day now, 
[02:06:00]  people are asking me how they can improve their vision  without expensive or risky laser surgery.  Hi, I'm Mariette Hartley,  and I've been recommending the SeeClearly method  for over two years now,  and I'm here to tell you it works.  People discover that in just minutes a day,  they can reduce or possibly even eliminate  their need for glasses or contacts.  For years, the standard approach to vision care  has been to buy stronger and stronger glasses  as our eyes get weaker and weaker.  The more we wear glasses or contacts, 
[02:06:30]  the more our eyes grow dependent upon them,  and the weaker they become.  The SeeClearly method is a natural proven program  designed by doctors for you and your family  to improve your vision at home safely and effectively.  In minutes a day,  it can help you see clearer and sharper  than you ever thought possible.  So call today for a free video  that introduces the power of the SeeClearly method,  someone who cares is waiting to take your call.  Call 1-800-315-1163.  That's easy.  1-800-315-1163.

I didn't even know I said that.  Lieutenant Boogaloo writes  on the instant feedback  O.B., who gives birth  to their husbands?  Did you say that? 
[02:13:30]  Probably.  I mess up my words all the time.  I was saying we want  videotape of some of the  crazy things that are said  by the moms-to-be  to their husbands.  You know, a lot of people  videotape the birth  which I think is ridiculous.  The hell is that?  Who the hell are you  showing that to?  I heard recently  that it's illegal.  Is it?  They don't allow it anymore.  Why is that?  So we'd have to get  the older videotapes.  Why did they make it illegal?  You know, the mothers-to-be  just losing their effing minds  because legal reasons, I guess. 
[02:14:00]  I wonder why.  Maybe they don't want  videotape of it just in case  the doctor slips up  in the insurance companies.  That's probably it.  There's a video out there  of moms-to-be  losing their minds.  Yeah.  Screaming and yelling  at their husbands  as they're giving birth  to their kid.  The husbands give birth.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Dan, don't miss anything.  Yes, Anthony.  You were...  This whole conversation 
[02:14:30]  was reminding me  of my great wedding day.  You had a great day, right?  And, uh, no.  And I...  More details are...  are sifting through my brain here  and coming to the surface.  Do you know,  my wife of mere hours,  mere hours,  when we finally, uh,  we, we, uh,  had the wedding  at the Justice of the Pieces house  in the living room,  then we went to the bar  that's now a strip club  for the reception. 
[02:15:00]  And then everyone went back  to where we lived,  which was a bottom floor apartment  in a house in Greenlawn.  I was going to say,  which trailer park?  No, it was,  it was in Greenlawn.  Some, like,  bottom basement apartment thing,  but we were able  to use the yard that day.  Oh!  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  Was this me?  Am I talking about me?  The split-level ranch?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was one of those, uh,  you know, those, uh,  yeah, split-level ranch.  It's like a two-story deal, 
[02:15:30]  but...  So your mom was renting  the bottom half?  No, no, no.  This was just people in Greenlawn.  Other people that were  down at the bar,  you know, lived upstairs,  some drinking guys,  you know,  and we had the apartment  downstairs.  We all shared the rent,  you know, that kind of deal.  Remember an old car  on blocks in the backyard?  Oh.  Yeah, just put some  bunting on that.  That'll look good.  Put a little decoration on that.  Oh, God,  it was horrible.  And then the kicker,  uh, well, the wife... 
[02:16:00]  Hey, uh, you know what?  Uh, I'm gonna leave  for about ten minutes.  No, no.  Because when you start  talking this way,  it gets really uncomfortable.  No, no.  Well, put it this way.  Do I have to look at you?  Everyone's drinking, right?  Everyone's drinking.  Mm-hmm.  And the wife gets hammered.  Hammered.  And, uh...  Well, let me play the other side.  A lot of, uh,  people get hammered  at their own...  Sure, sure.  Like I said,  the wife was hammered.  She, she all of a sudden...  Were you hammered?  Um, I was, I was pretty good. 
[02:16:30]  I was doing all right.  But you know me.  I don't get to the point  where I get out of control.  Belligerent.  No, not at all.  I, I like to, uh,  stay focused on things.  Believe me, I wanted to...  I needed heroin that day.  I should have had it.  So, uh, uh, the wife  of mere hours  had gotten into this problem  with my brother.  Because my...  She had thought  in, in some stupor  that my brother  was trying to, uh, 
[02:17:00]  pick up her cousin  that had come down  from Massachusetts.  and she didn't  like my brother.  Thought he was a scumbag.  Why didn't your wife  like your brother?  Oh, what the hell  do I know?  Well, I don't know.  She just doesn't,  didn't like him.  At the time.  Right.  So, she thinks  it's a good idea  to then, uh,  go in  to the, the house  where my mother  is sitting  and start yelling  and cursing out  my mother  about what a prick  my brother is. 
[02:17:30]  And I'm standing there like,  your son  is a scumbag  effing  where my feet  where my feet  You know, I, uh,  I, I forgot something  down the hall.  No, you didn't.  No, you didn't.  I'm going to take  a little walk.  Your f***ing son  is trying to f***  my cousin  and I don't want  the f***ing  the f***  and my mother 
[02:18:00]  sitting there like,  what?  She gives me a look  like, um,  you just married this?  You just,  I'm sitting  on a couch  with duct-taped arms  in your basement  apartment  and your brand new  drunken wife  is cursing me out  because she hates  your brother?  You want to go get  a cup of coffee?  And, and, and, and,  and, and,  you know my family. 
[02:18:30]  My family is probably  the closest family  you will ever see  on the face of this earth.  We would kill  for each other.  So, my mother  is doing this  balancing act  because anybody's  bad-mouthing my brother,  she will lunge.  Sal calls her a tigress  with her young.  She will,  she will lunge.  Yet, she couldn't  because now  she's got to think  of me too.  I just,  I just married into this.  So now,  she's sitting there  like,  what do, 
[02:19:00]  what,  Anthony,  why do,  and that,  if he goes near her again,  I'm throwing  the whole bunch  of you  scum  out of the  and I'm just like,  I felt like Fredo  at that wedding.  Remember the party,  hey,  Freddie,  you want us to  take care of this  or you want us to,  yeah,  take care of it.  Take care of it.  Never marry a wop.  Never marry a wop.  She did not say that.  Oh,  it was brutal.  It was brutal. 
[02:19:30]  And I stood there like,  what,  and that's when it hit me.  That's when it hit me  a ton of bricks.  I was like,  what did I,  what did I,  what did I just get myself into?  What did I get myself into?  Yeah,  we have audio.  Oh my God.  At his wedding,  right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  At this moment.  At this moment.  We have audio  of what you were thinking,  Anthony.  What happened?  We knew we were going to do  a radio show,  so we figured we'd better  start taping you.  Oh,  good.  Way back then. 
[02:20:00]  So,  here's Anthony  at that moment.  Yeah.  Yeah,  that was pretty much it.  I was like,  I was,  I was a broken,  beaten man,  and I had been married  for six hours.  Six hours of marriage,  and I was broken  and beaten. 
[02:20:30]  Hey,  here's audio of your uncle  trying to make you feel better  every time,  right?  How about a first guy?  Here's me.  I got nowhere else to go!  I got nowhere else to go!  Oh my God.  Oh,  it was horrid.  What a dark day that was,  man.  Did you scream at her? 
[02:21:00]  Yeah,  what'd you do?  No,  I was shocked.  Oh!  Oh!  What did you drop?  You're fine.  Oh!  I was in a state of shock.  I was standing there,  and like,  then I kind of like,  ushered off like,  hey,  hey,  hey,  relax,  this isn't the time or place.  You're like,  hey,  hey,  hey,  at least I have  my friend booze. 
[02:21:30]  So I was like,  oh my God.  My friend the captain.  I'm like,  oh my God.  Frank from Manhattan.  So,  Ant,  at what point did the cameras from cops show up to immortalize this happy occasion?  No,  that's all it needed.  Woo!  Bad boys,  bad boys.  We're responding to a domestic.  Me and my cheap old suit.  Did you guys at least cut the back lawn?  Yeah,  I think the back lawn was cut. 
[02:22:00]  Nice.  Some big tarp was put up.  Very nice.  It was awful.  Did you have some decorations?  Yeah,  I think they were like wedding bells tilted slightly sideways.  Where'd you go on your honeymoon?  Decorations.  There was no honeymoon.  There was no honeymoon.  I wasn't affording a honeymoon.  I was working for Apollo air conditioning.  I had my Apollo van.  I'm sure you could have went to Lake Ronkonkoma for the weekend.  Could have.  I didn't even go to Atlantic City.  I couldn't afford anything.  I was broke. 
[02:22:30]  I didn't have a pot to whiz in or a window to throw it out of.  You didn't have a honeymoon?  No,  there was no honeymoon.  What happened right after the wedding?  Let's see.  Did it take the next day off at least?  I don't even remember.  I don't even remember.  I went upstairs.  I believe she had passed out.  And I believe I laid there looking at the ceiling with tears of regret and sorrow.  rolling down the sides of my face.  That was happy honeymoon. 
[02:23:00]  Hey,  let's...  Never mind.  Getting a little uncomfortable in here,  Anthony.  Got audio of Anthony Beans.  It's also getting stinky in here.  Did you fart again?  No,  I did not.  Ben,  please,  get me the...  I really did not.  It's Jim Norton,  because he hasn't said a word in the last five minutes.  God damn it,  Norton.  Son of a bitch.  He always sits there quietly after he rips.  Oh,  my God.  Here's Ant being brave to his new wife at the time.  Hey,  why don't you stop dressing me up like a male man 
[02:23:30]  and making me dance for you  while you go and smoke crack in your bedroom  and have sex with some guy I don't even know  on my dad's bed.  There it is.  A lot of questions coming in,  Anthony,  for you.  Yeah.  Hey,  Chris,  how are you?  Hey,  what's up,  boys?  Hey,  man.  I was just wondering who catered Anthony's wedding.  Was it Swanson or Hungry Man?  Love you,  Norton.  Love you,  Sticky.  Oh,  Jesus.  Hey,  what about me?  Love you.  It isn't fair.  Later,  guys.  Moving pictures. 
[02:24:00]  Oh,  man.  Mike?  I'll answer,  Mike.  All right.  No,  I'm...  If you want to go somewhere else first.  Yeah,  Mike,  hold on.  All right,  Mike?  Mike?  Say it,  yeah?  What's up,  man?  What's your little question?  Do you have any friends that would try to talk you out of marrying this woman?  Here is the deal.  Oh,  God.  Friends cannot talk people out of marrying other people.  That's true.  I've had this conversation.  You can't do it.  It's a situation where, first of all, once you pop that question, you know what I mean? 
[02:24:30]  You're on the peak of the roller coaster, and now you're just ready to go down.  If a friend can only talk a friend off of the marriage roller coaster before you get into the car,  you know what I'm talking about?  Once you're on, it's very difficult to get back off, and you just get on that ride, and it's over.  And your friend has to make a decision.  If I go up to him and say, this girl isn't good for you, you might F the friendship up. 
[02:25:00]  You'll always be there as a friend to the guy, even when the marriage ends.  But if you screw it up and say, you shouldn't marry this chick, you might blow the friendship.  So many guys will not tell the guy not to do this.  I didn't tell my brother.  And like I hope you said, at the wedding, we're all just going, dude, this is just a goddamn disaster in the making.  You know?  But you don't do it.  So you wait, and...  Yeah, but they passed out the blow-up guitar and those Risky Business sunglasses. 
[02:25:30]  And the blow-up saxophones.  We're all feeling good for a while.  It was a rock and roll wedding.  Rock and roll.  What's that?  The blow-up guitars?  You ever see the guitars, they're like beach ball material, and you blow them up, and it's a guitar, and everyone plays air guitar?  They passed how many of them out?  Oh, there's probably like 10, 12, a dozen of them.  Just, and everyone gets on the dance floor and...  And everyone plays air guitar. 
[02:26:00]  Go, Johnny, go!  Go, do you need a rock and roll?  Go, Johnny, go!  Right.  Go, go!  I've never seen that.  That is the worst thing I've ever heard.  Oh, you haven't been to a wedding lately, Mike?  Yes, I have.  My buddy Frank, he's got married, he's a cop, and it was a dignified man's wedding.  Yeah.  You dance, your daddy's little girl with your bride, and that's it.  More audio of Anthony getting tough with his new bride.  Uh-huh.  Hey, listen, Missy.  Why don't you go knit me a sweater before I slap you in the face?  Anthony, what was your wedding song? 
[02:26:30]  Well, Paul E. from Lawrence is saying, did you guys walk down the aisle to Bob Buckman on WBAB?  We just had the radio on.  Did not.  You didn't have, like, a little reception in the backyard?  No, there was no wedding song.  There was no big reception.  You had to have some form of entertainment.  It was just a party.  Did you have a magician in the backyard?  There was nothing.  Little magic tricks?  There was a tape player playing with speakers up in the upstairs window. 
[02:27:00]  Did you have your 8-tracks?  A little box of 8-tracks?  No, no 8-tracks.  Cassette tapes.  Oh, man.  Cassette tapes.  Lewis, what's up?  Dude, this is the ultimate cringe radio.  That was horrific, dude.  I'm just curious.  Was your wedding song, Fairy Tales Could Come True?  It could happen to you.  If you're stupid enough.  Yeah, well, thank you.  Hey, dude, I'm going outside and I'm chopping my wedding ring fingers off. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, do that.  All right, Lewis.  Later.  The wedding song at that wedding should have been one bourbon, one shot, one beer.  Yeah, exactly.  It was hard.  It was, I look back, it was one of the worst days of my life.  Did I screw that one up?  Nor Scott.  You know what?  Good.  Because I don't know George Durrell good stuff.  Good for me to not know it.  Of course.  It's not six o'clock yet.  You can't go into your musical room.  I'm not going to, I'm just, I'm not, I'm not ranting.  The point I'm making is that I'm glad I didn't.  More audio vampy and brave. 
[02:28:00]  All right.  There's new bride.  Hey, you get your bitch ass back in the kitchen and make me some pie.  Yeah, there you go.  All right.  See, the whole wedding was supposed to be.  We're not breaking any agreements here today, are we?  No, I just can't talk about any of the divorce proceedings or any settlement things.  I could talk about my life being married and my wedding.  Of course.  Okay.  Walter.  I just held it back in my head in a dark spot in my brain that probably contains abuse at  some point in my childhood. 
[02:28:30]  Ooh.  It's probably the same spot that that monster jumps out of.  Walter, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Yo, yo, Anthony.  Yeah.  I heard she was passed out.  Did you have sex with her at least?  Oh, you know something?  I don't even think so.  I don't know.  I was horrified.  I was very sorry what I had just done.  It was one of the worst days of my life.  It's not rape if there's a ring on the finger. 
[02:29:00]  And I really realized to get out of it quick because it only took nine and a half years for  me to leave.  I am a glutton for punishment.  I had nothing.  And then I decide, hey, what's better than being in a marriage that I really don't want  to be in?  Hmm.  Financial debt.  That's good.  I'll fill out a bunch of Visa and MasterCard things and get about $25,000 in debt.  That'll help me out.  I'll buy a jet ski to escape my life. 
[02:29:30]  You know what I had to do?  I got, I got, I got.  You're still talking?  I got a bunch of credit cards, right?  Yeah.  That I couldn't possibly pay off.  And I knew it.  Then I had to talk, the girl that didn't want me to even get a cell phone.  What do you need that for?  It's a waste of money.  I'm like, well, everyone's got one.  Opie's got one.  Could I get one?  No.  So I didn't get a cell phone.  So then I had to talk her into how the money, the credit I had on the credit cards that  was supposed to be for emergencies only, somehow a Sea-Doo jet ski was an emergency at that 
[02:30:00]  very moment.  And I went out and I bought one.  Everyone just keep nodding at Anthony.  And any minute I got, I spent out on the water with my Sea-Doo.  And I never, ever, ever would have paid off that debt.  Hey, more audio, Vance.  First day of marriage.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work. 
[02:30:30]  I've been here for seven years.  Five years.  Scott from Redding.  Hey, Ant, did the OTB have the over-under on how long your wedding would last?  Just think, if Anthony would have faked being asleep all those years ago, perhaps, oh, wouldn't  have faked being asleep.  Perhaps Richard could have talked him out of marriage.  Yeah, you blew off your best friend.  No, I didn't.  Did she do this for you?  Yeah.  Oh, my God. 
[02:31:00]  Johnny, get ahead.  Hey, what's up, Arminag?  Hey, man.  Hey, little Jim.  How you doing?  Hi, Johnny.  Hey, Ant, I heard a rumor that your wedding cake was Fudgy the Whale.  Is that true?  Fudgy the Whale for any wedding occasion.  A cookie puss?  Cookie puss?  You need a cookie puss.  They're all the same cake, just done up there.  Oh, very good, bro. 
[02:31:30]  All right, later, guys.  All right.  No, I have not watched my wedding video.  Oh, wait.  I refuse to.  Well, Bobby Bigrigger's got something on that.  Yes, Bobby Bigrigger?  Hey, you got the audio there, Anthony, reviewing his wedding video.  I don't have it with me.  George C. Scott?  Oh, turn it off.  Turn it off.  Yeah.  Very good, Bobby.  Yeah, if I watched it now, I'd be just like George C. Scott watching his daughter get double-teamed.  Grab it the back of the chair.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  You have that? 
[02:32:00]  That wedding?  No, I don't know where that is.  She might have it, or she threw it in the fireplace with everything else.  Holy cow, look at this guy.  James from Jersey.  Hey, James, you're next on the O&A Show.  What's up?  Hey, man, I got married just over a week ago.  My life went to hell.  I work 15 hours a day.  The bitch wakes me up yesterday to help her clean the house after I slept for three hours.  And I said, let me sleep.  She starts screaming and cursing at me.  She pushed me. 
[02:32:30]  Dude, life sucks when you're married, man.  And I realized that.  Why did you do it?  What's that?  Anthony wants to know how long, and I want to know why you did it.  Yeah, how long were you married?  Just about two weeks.  Oh, God.  Oh.  Why do we have this obsession that we have to commit?  I mean, like forever.  Why?  So they can nag you?  Jesus.  I wish I never did.  I wish I did.  All right, James.  Thank you.  Hey, Mike, what's up?  I just want to beg, Anthony, to continue this conversation for the rest of the time, unabated, 
[02:33:00]  because you are doing a service to thousands and thousands of men.  And the anger, the pure frustration and grief that emanates from your voices, it's inspiring.  Please keep it up.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's very comfortable to listen to as he's four feet in front of your face.  Well, you know, I'm sorry, Opie, but I don't know.  I noticed you haven't gotten married yet, so it's working for you.  Please, Anthony, please.  I'm running out of things to buy.  Oh, my.  Well, you know, that's a good one. 
[02:33:30]  Keep it up, guys.  Great show.  I don't know what I was, like, doing back then.  I was on this, I was on, like, a train.  My whole life was on this train track.  It really was, with everything.  Like, if I got that job, like, I got that job at Apollo Air Conditioning, right?  Tin knocking.  I wanted to further myself.  I wanted to do something.  But I was always, once I got on a track, I could not get off of it.  And I just stayed there, being miserable, doing a job I really didn't want to do. 
[02:34:00]  Fine people, though, they were at Apollo Air Conditioning.  Don't get me wrong there.  I'm just saying, the work, I hated it.  And then, the whole marriage thing, I reached a point before I got married that I was saying,  how is this getting to this point?  And instead of speaking up and going, hey, you know, it's going a little quick.  I really don't want to get married.  I just stayed on the goddamn track, and I just trudged forward until before I know it,  I'm saying I do.  And I was like, I really, Opie, you can look at me, Opie. 
[02:34:30]  Are you still talking?  See, you're just looking at machinery and Rick, and you look a little uncomfortable.  No, not at all.  I'm here to support you.  But my personality had always been like that, and thank God, like, it did finally change.  Like, I realized, you know, and it changed after I started working in radio.  And I'm working with Opie and whatnot.  And then before I knew it, I was like, you know something?  I could kind of control my destiny here somewhat.  And you've got to, you know, as they say, grab that bull by the horns and divorce her. 
[02:35:00]  Did you pick yourself up by your bootstraps?  Yes, right by them.  A little strap in the back.  I got audio of you the day after the wedding.  Oh, you do, do you?  Oh, yes, I do.  This is less fun than previously indicated.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Hey, your good friend Foot wants in on this.  Hey!  Hey, Foot.  Hey, what's happening?  How you doing, Foot?  Oh, man, I got another laugh for you.  How's, hey, hey, first of all, Foot, I was your best man at your wedding. 
[02:35:30]  Yes, you are.  And how are things going in the Foot marriage?  Very happy, very happy.  The duct tape is holding nicely.  You got it in the closet all wrapped up?  Sure, she moans and groans a couple of times.  I just hit her with a stick.  Now, you have something to add to my wedding story?  Yes, I guess she was so busy with that whole incident with, you know, between your mother  and your new beloved wife that you forgot that your mother-in-law was trashed and trying  to pick up one of our friends.  Oh, God damn, that was right.  I forgot about that.  And don't forget that dress that she was wearing, this white dress with these black polka dots. 
[02:36:00]  She looked like a drunken Dalmatian stumbling all over your backyard.  That shot is cute.  This was hysterical.  Foot, I'll explain.  Hold on a minute.  Right.  There was my mother-in-law, and she was a little sauce, too.  Everybody just pounded him down.  So she's sitting on the couch.  My mother is, like, on another couch, I guess.  And a friend of ours, Sean Simoleski, the bison. 
[02:36:30]  The bison.  The bison, as we called him.  He was sitting on the couch.  Judy lays down, puts her legs over the bison's legs, and starts passing out.  The bison, who, you know, he was the worst with girls, I got to say it, starts rubbing  on her legs.  He's rubbing her legs on the couch.  And we're looking like, at one point, Foot comes up and goes, what's the bison doing? 
[02:37:00]  I go, I don't know.  He's trying to pick up on my mother-in-law or something, and she's not stopping him.  Yeah.  And I'm so attritioned, I'm like, hey, the bison's trying to nail that Dalmatian.  Well, thanks for that memory there, Foot.  All right.  I'm here to help.  We'll see you guys later.  All right.  Well, we got audio by Ann's mom talking to Ann at the wedding.  Ah, right?  Yeah.  The world is a jungle.  And if you want my advice, Anthony, don't expect happiness. 
[02:37:30]  You won't get it.  People let you down.  And I'm not naming any names.  But in the end, you die in your own arms.  Wow.  It seems like just yesterday that my mommy was giving me that speech.  Oof.  Well, there's a couple more here, right?  A balloon, not Joe, wants in.  Hey, Anthony.  Hi.  What kind of wedding gifts did you get at your backyard wedding? 
[02:38:00]  Let me think.  I just know it was cash.  It was just a lot of cash.  I don't remember getting a lot of things.  I think we got a crock pot.  I think we got a crock pot.  I don't know.  Something to heat up the old Jack Danielson, I guess.  I don't know.  So, hey, Pete, what's going on?  Hey, Opie, Anthony, Norton, what's going on, fellas?  What up?  And I have a question that's been boggling my mind for like the past half hour. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  Did you get your photos taken in one of those little $2 booths?  Like in front of those grocery stores, you see?  Where it spits out those six black and white photos.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I just want to thank you, too.  26 years old.  Got a girlfriend.  And you're so talking me out of marriage with her right now.  It's just horrific.  Oh, man.  Let me tell you.  All right.  Thank you, Pete.  You're welcome.  Look at this guy.  He wrote.  Well, Chris, say what you want to say, Chris.  Yeah.  My brother, when I found out he was getting engaged, I wrote him a letter. 
[02:39:00]  I put it in print saying, this is not the right person.  This is a bad idea.  13 years later, he's finally getting divorced.  So I applaud him.  We've got to put it in the Times next to the engagements and applaud all these people for  getting out of this stupid-ass institution.  Did he hold it against you?  No, but he showed her the letter.  And she, four years later, said to me, you know, I saw that letter you wrote.  And I said, good.  I still stand by it.  Wow.  All right. 
[02:39:30]  Well, see.  But it didn't work, though.  Well, he's out.  Yeah, but 13 years later?  You were in for nine, right?  Yeah, he's working for me.  Purgatory.  It's brutal.  It's a bad institution.  Yeah, we know that.  Beth from Alexandria, Virginia, saying, the Sea-Doo's not the only thing Ann talked his  ex into.  Very funny, Beth.  Everybody said what a prick Gene Simmons was, and he's right.  Why do it?  Ann, a crockpot is just as good as the George Foreman grill you gave Rick. 
[02:40:00]  I didn't get Rick a George Foreman grill.  The name was on it.  My name was on it.  I didn't buy the goddamn George Foreman grill for Rick's wedding.  I cut Rick a nice check.  I didn't know where the grill came from.  Was that an engagement?  No, that was a wedding rehearsal shower gift.  That was it.  A wedding shower gift.  But your name was on it.  Thanks.  Great.  Anthony, I got audio of the guy that married you way back when.  It was part of your ceremony, actually. 
[02:40:30]  He looked right at you and said this.  The power of Christ compels you!  The power of Christ compels you!  I do.  The power of Christ compels you!  I do.  The power of Christ compels you!  Yes, yes, I do.  I am so grand-shocked.  Here's how much I want to get married.  Oh, another memory.  Another memory.  Oh, boy.  Another memory.  Hey, look at the time.  I think we should break.  Christmas. 
[02:41:00]  I got engaged up in Massachusetts on Christmas.  Right?  Now, that sounds like a very lovely thing to do.  No.  Why not?  First of all, now, at this point, she's completely expecting it.  Completely expecting it.  Like, it's another thing, like I said, I got on that track, and she had planned all this.  And I just went with it.  My life was in such hell then, like I really didn't care.  So I'm like, eh, what the hell, you know? 
[02:41:30]  You're stupid.  Right, Anthony.  I'm stupid.  So, I knew she was expecting it, right?  You're a friggin' moron.  I know, Anthony.  I didn't even have the ring.  Opie, do you know when I bought the ring?  I'm talking to you.  Are you listening?  Usually I do.  You're a little, you need something to wipe your brow?  I see you sweat. 
[02:42:00]  Why are you sweating?  Well, Anthony, because not both of us got divorced.  I bought the ring December 23rd in Penn Station.  I was taking the train up there, because she had been up there already, and I was taking  the train up there to propose.  Yeah. 
[02:42:30]  I didn't have Opie.  You can come back.  I'm opening the window.  I need to come back.  I didn't have the ring.  So I'm like, all right, now I just got to go out and buy the ring, I guess.  Because we're a fine syndicator radio show.  Penn Station is our local transit.  I believe the nation does know what Penn Station is.  It's the big train station here in New York City.  Where the hell is Penn Station?  Do you buy a ring?  Do you know all those stores that are in there?  You didn't buy it off an Ethiopian, did you?  Yeah, I went into one of those jewelry stores in Penn Station. 
[02:43:00]  I pointed at one and went, all right, and I think I spent, I think it was about 300 bucks  on it.  Oh, my God.  And it was like, I can't even make my fingers go that small.  Trying.  Hey, more audio of the guy that married you, Anthony.  All right.  This was right after you did your I do's.  Oh, okay.  So it was officially had one other thing to say to you.  Let's hear.  You get nothing. 
[02:43:30]  You lose.  Good day, sir.  And he walked out.  I thought, I remember it as a handshake and a, you know, good luck.  But perhaps I'm just mistaken.  Give you one of these.  Gave you a little fist on the chin, kind of.  Take that with you.  You're a good egg chin.  You're a good egg, Noonan.  So you bought the ring at Penn Station.  Penn Station.  Okay.  Yeah.  Like, right before I had to go up there.  I had put it off as long as I could. 
[02:44:00]  But for some reason, I did it.  And I went up and that was it.  You're romantic.  Hopeless.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm sure that there's two sides to every story.  But as a chick, you don't want to hear that your guy just bought a ring at a train station.  I'm not saying that, you know.  But this is all now coming back to me in a way that I'm looking at it like, oh, my God.  You know, I'm kind of seeing where I was at at that point.  I was a confused young man trying to, I don't know, just doing anything. 
[02:44:30]  Like, my life was getting up, going to a job I hated, going to the bar, going home.  What was it?  So I'm figuring, all right.  Hey, Ann, I'll throw marriage into the mix.  Maybe it'll spice things up.  Who changed your life?  Who changed my life?  It was a wonderful guy named Brother Joe that sent a tape into Opie.  Are you scared? 
[02:45:00]  You scum, man.  Wow, that really is one to hold over someone's head.  Oh, my God.  F you.  Penn Station.  All right.  Good.  Yeah, you're buying your ring at Penn Station.  And then you drove all the way up to Massachusetts, and then you asked.  I went up to Massachusetts.  So that must have been nice.  You probably, I don't know, went to dinner or something.  No, no.  It was in the mother-in-law's living room.  They were having a family Christmas party over there.  And let me tell you something.  Oh, boy. 
[02:45:30]  Wow.  Hey, I just wanted a simple answer.  There we go.  Oh, my God.  Yes or no would have been fine.  They could pound him down, man.  Let me tell you.  Let me tell you.  The first thing I did.  Okay.  Here it is.  The first thing I did.  Oh, oh, I didn't take the train up there.  I had got the ring there, but for some reason, I was going back out to Long Island to get my car.  So I bought the ring.  My car was a Volkswagen Beetle cut up and fiberglassed into a Baja Bug.  Did you ever see these off-road vehicles with the engine exposed? 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  And the fiberglass front.  It's almost like a combination dune buggy Volkswagen.  Those rock if you're in California.  Yeah, I know.  Well, I had to drive that up to Massachusetts in the middle of the winter with no heat.  So I had blankets.  I was wrapped up in blankets as I'm driving because I was freezing cold with the ring in your blue head. 
[02:46:30]  I was freezing.  So I finally get up there, four hours of freezing cold wind blowing through.  Because when you cut up into a Baja Bug, you take a lot of the front bulkhead off of the Volkswagen.  And through the speaker holes, icy cold air is blowing through.  Through the speedometer, like, I felt freezing.  So I'm wrapped in a blanket driving up there with my $300 Penn Station wedding ring, ready to pop the question. 
[02:47:00]  Your ring cost $300.  It was a $300 ring.  You really stunk.  I was horrible.  How many times?  I was in hell.  I was in hell.  The first thing I did, I pull up.  Now, the whole family's there.  And this is the first time they're meeting me.  This is the first time the family is even meeting me.  And I'm ready to pop this question. 
[02:47:30]  And I'm freezing cold.  I have the Link from the Mod Squad afro hairdo going.  And I'm pulling up in a Volkswagen.  I'm the prince, ready to sweep your little girl off her feet.  Here he comes.  The knight in shining armor.  I go upstairs.  The first thing I do is, you got Captain Morgan?  Swear to God.  I downed three Captain Morgans with splashes of Coke in it. 
[02:48:00]  Whoosh!  Whoosh!  In huge water glasses.  That's when I think they finally accepted me into the family.  And, yeah, then in a semi-drunken stupor, all I did was I opened up the box.  And I didn't even say, will you marry me, I don't think.  I just went, here.  As I remember it. 
[02:48:30]  I think I said, here.  And everybody was like, oh, hey, hey, hey.  Yeah.  Penn Station.  You bought your ring ten feet from where homos cruised.  I wish before I bought it, someone would have pushed me in front of a train.  It would have been less painful.  Hey, we found audio of your dance. 
[02:49:00]  The first dance is man and woman.  Would you like to hear it?  All right.  Rock and roll McDonald's.  Rock and roll McDonald's.  It's bringing me right back.  Thanks, guys.  Rock and roll McDonald's.  Rock and roll McDonald's.  Rock and roll McDonald's.  Rock and roll McDonald's, rock and roll McDonald's, rock and roll McDonald's. 
[02:49:30]  And dip.  That guy's great.  Wow.  Yeah, that was fun.  Yeah.  I enjoyed that.  That was some good radio.  Woo.  Okay.  Pluto from Penn Station, he goes, here, you poet, how could she resist? 
[02:50:00]  Did you at least feel better?  No.  It's like all coming back, and I realized how not in control of my life I was back then.  I just like, Will from Cleveland, Anthony, don't you feel like a jackass?  Well, no. 
[02:50:30]  Anthony, did you phone Z100 for a dedication song after you bought the ring in Penn Station?  Would have been sweet.  A little shout out.  Did you say here when you brought the other girl home?  These people are very funny.  I got to give him credit.  Jersey Bob.  Here.  Here.  Here.  Here.  Ah.  That's funny.  All right.  Oh, you really were an ass.  I know. 
[02:51:00]  What can I say?  I was an ass.  I had no control over my own life, and I went many years doing that, just kind of falling  into a rut, and instead of, like, getting out of it, I would just go along and see where  it was going to end up.  But how do you get out of it?  That's the tough thing.  That's what you're doing.  You finally get something in life that is cool and good, and it gives you a little more  incentive to either keep it or further yourself in the field or with somebody or anything  else.  It's like, when you're in a rut like that, I was just, I wasn't happy, the situation 
[02:51:30]  I was in, but I wasn't, like, completely miserable.  I just was there.  I was totally just existing.  I was existing.  Hey, Travis, what's up?  Oh, and hey.  Hey.  What's up, little Jimmy?  Hi, Travis.  Hi.  And, I want to ask you.  I have a six-digit phone number.  Yeah.  When you and Joe Pesci were driving to pick up the wedding cake in your air conditioning  van, were you planning your bets for the horses, or were you thinking about your new 
[02:52:00]  wife?  Oh, my God.  That is so true.  I called him a fat bastard.  Hey, you're going to check my oil?  I'll tell you.  Hey, I got to tell you, you know.  You guys suck.  All right, Travis.  Yeah.  I think I did pick up the wedding cake in the Apollo air conditioning van.  I remember it kind of sitting there.  That's kind of nice.  You had a wedding cake.  That's cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay, well, you want a break now?  Oh, look at the time.  Time flies when you're in therapy. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah, it's Tuesday afternoon now.  Is it?  Here.  Let's see if there's any...  But you've got to realize...  ...where you go with this.  ...without getting into any details that I'm not allowed to get into, you've got to realize  what, like, what a lottery, what a lottery that girl hit.  Do you know what I mean?  Here comes your friggin' knight in shining armor driving up in the Volkswagen bug with  the $300 wedding ring, and all of a sudden, her lawyer, Dominic Barber, is sitting there 
[02:53:00]  going, and valued at $100 million.  The more I listen to this, the more I see their point.  Penn Station, backyard, no air conditioning in the VW, and a blanket.  Here's your ring.  Can I have a Captain Morgan?  Yeah, I bought this.  It was pulled off a cadaver in Ethiopia and shipped over.  I know.  Here's your ring.  Can you turn up the heat? 
[02:53:30]  I'm freezing.  Oh, I have the mistakes.  I know.  I was horrible.  I was awful.  Matt from Garden City, I just want to let you guys know that the light that says on the  air is still on.  Yeah.  Thank you.  We like to vent.  Well, sure.  Mm-hmm.  All right, we're going to step aside.  Yeah.  We got as much as we can out of that one.  All right.  All right. 
[02:54:00]  Instead of saying, I do, did Anthony say, sure, why not?  All right.  All right.  Yeah.  Anthony, please talk slower.  I'm taking notes and can't write that fast.  You better, you bastards.  No, that was Dominic Barber.  Oh.  See you in court next contract negotiation.  Nah.  You know, yeah, listen up, people. 
[02:54:30]  Well, if you think you're being railroaded somewhere, take control of your life and do  something.  Now's the time.  And pay attention, ladies, that if your new fiance has the romantic ability of leukemia, pray  that he's funny.  Yeah.  Have him sing you a song parody first.  If it's good, hitch.  Oh.  All right.  We're going to break.  All right.  All right.

[02:57:30]  Welcome to Light Beer Logic, where we illustrate why it's boneheaded thinking to be drinking regular old brown bottled light beer.  Unless you're a woodsy kind of guy.  A guy who likes slapping blood and gorge mosquitoes against his face.  Who likes sleeping in a tent full of men who haven't showered in three days and try to mask the odor with pine-scented insect repellent.  But that's not you.  You're a flop down on the beach, relaxing the sun kind of guy. 
[02:58:00]  Making Corona Light your escape from bugs, B.O. and boring light beers.  Corona Light is the ideal light beer when woods are a piece of driftwood that wash up on the shore.  The only slap you want is sunscreen on your shoulders or another Corona Light in your hands.  Where Kickin' Back is a full-time job at Cares Wash Away with the Tire.  Corona Light.  Miles away from other light beers.  Imported by the Gambrinus Company, San Antonio, Texas.

[03:00:30]  Tonight, we're going to do a little thing called forward drinking.  A new taste for a new millennium.  Something totally tomorrow called OP.  A forward move into the next liquid experience.  OP is the finest vodka, but it's way beyond vodka.  It's flavored with natural orange, peach, ginger, and a little something extra we like to call Swedish tradition.  Ooh, what it does to a cosmopolitan. 
[03:01:00]  A mellow taste.  Something no one vodka has.  Say it with me, baby.  OP.  Just look for the cool, frosted bottle with the two yellow arrows and say, OP.  Forward drinking.  OP is imported by Creon and Quarters, Paramus, New Jersey.  OPvodka.com.  And here's some forward thinking.  For all OP's sold until 2003, we're giving $12 a case to City Meals on Wheels to help them feed thousands of New Yorkers.  OP.  Forward drinking. 
[03:01:30]  OP vodka reminds you to drink responsibly.  This week at Acme, get summer's freshest produce.  Yellow or white sweet corn.  Tan ears, $199.  Buy one pint of Jersey blueberries.  Get another free.  Plus Pepsi 24-pack cubes, $399 with your Acme Supercard.  If you're one of the millions of American drivers who suffer from seasonal allergies, beware.  Many allergy medications have cautions while driving.  Today, more than half of the states and the U.S. have laws against driving if you have taken a drug that impairs your performance,  even if you do not realize it at the time.  Patients should heed warnings on all product labels that suggest using caution when driving after taking sedating medications, 
[03:02:00]  including allergy medications.  If you suffer from seasonal allergies, ask your doctor about Allegra, Fexafenidine Hydrochloride,  and add a histamine that is non-impairing while driving.  Fexafenidine is a unique ingredient that combats your seasonal allergy symptoms.  Itchy, watery eyes, plus sneezing and runny nose.  But unlike many over-the-counter allergy medications, Allegra won't make you drowsy.  For people 12 and older, side effects are low and may include cold or flu, nausea, and menstrual pain.

They hired world's strongman runner-up for Naz Fardust to crush a full-sized keg to keg can size with his bare hands.  I can't do it.  I can't do it.  I can't do it. 
[03:03:00]  Theory number 15.  They put a full-sized keg in ice water, hoping it would shrivel.  Did it shrivel?  Yeah.  Look.  I meant the keg.  It's cute, though.  Theory number 8.  They humiliated a full-sized keg and made it feel small.  You're pathetic.  You're weak.  You are nothing.  Look at that waistline.  You're just a big, fat, porky keg. 
[03:03:30]  Take this.  Oh, there goes the big toe.  The one-of-a-kind Heineken keg can.  How did they do that?  Imported by Heineken USA, White Plains, New York.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  quasi-m espectacular.

What do you mean,  who am I?  I'm Adam.  May I tempt you  with a Red Bull?  Tempt me?  With a bull?  Hello? 
[03:09:00]  It's a job for a snake.  But, my dear,  Red Bull  is an energy drink  that gives you a wave.  Oh, tempting,  very tempting.  But why do you want  to fly out of paradise?

I bet you hate it,  don't you?  I know I did.  But I decided  I wasn't going  to take it anymore.  I also knew  I didn't want  to go through  the pain and expense  of transplants  or weaves  and I didn't want  to spend thousands  on prescription drugs  or risk the side effects  they cause.  But I heard this commercial  for Avacor  and I realized  Avacor had found  the root of hair loss  problems. 
[03:10:00]  The problem is DHT,  this bad body chemical  that's the culprit  in most hair loss  and liquid Avacor  deep cleans the scalp.  Avacor all-natural  DHT blocker  keeps that DHT  from reaching  the hair follicles.  It stopped my hair loss.  I began to see results  in a few weeks.  People were asking me,  hey, what did you do  to yourself?  You look thinner,  younger.  Avacor is safe  for men and women.  There are no harmful  side effects.

You are not a Mega Man.  A Mega Man would buy  a big house  on every ocean,  even the Arctic Ocean.  A great big ice house  where trained penguin  butlers would wait  on you,  hand and flipper.  If I won Mega Millions,  I'd send my kids  to any school  they want. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, you are not  a Mega Woman.  A Mega Woman  would have the most  brilliant minds  in the world  to do her kids.  History taught  by prime ministers.

The O.B. and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  Sorry about that.  One guy wrote on the instant feedback,  man, what the F with all the commercials?  I could have been married and divorced  during that time. 
[03:13:00]  But we talked for a while there.  We did an hour straight of radio  and we have to, you know,  catch up on the other side,  unfortunately.  When you know that's going to happen,  go listen to a couple songs  and come back.  I don't care.  I mean, we do care,  but if we're in a flow,  we've got to go with it, right?  It's not every day  Ann spills his effing guts  like that on the air.  Well, you know,  it's good therapy.  All right, we're back  with the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Some girl drove all the way  from Philly,  some really hot 20-year-old blonde, 
[03:13:30]  to get her pictures done by Rick.  Mr. Rick.  Mr. Rick.  You know, she didn't have confidence  in WISP and their photographer.  She's entering the WOW contest  and she came to New York City  to get the pictures done.  Great move.  The girl is beautiful.  A beautiful blonde  representing Philly, I guess.  I guess we have to put her  in the contest  as a Philly representative.  As Philly, yeah.  As a Philly representative.  So, her picture should be up  on opianthony.com  within the next hour or so.  That must not make 
[03:14:00]  the guy in Philly feel that good.  She drives all the way here  because his photographic skills  aren't up to par.  Well, the guy in Philly,  he's more like a Pablo Picasso  type of guy.  He takes a lot of weird angles  and stuff.  She should have went to Sacramento.  He's very...  They at least know  how to take the pictures there  even though the crop  this time around  hasn't been that good.  Well, Sacramento has  the best staging for their shot.  They do.  The lighting, the camera.  And they got nice plants. 
[03:14:30]  And there's some kind of shade.  Just looks like a...  It looks like a penthouse studio  or something.  Yeah.  Really nice.  But Rick is doing a bang-up job.  I just saw him...  Chicago looks like  they just throw the girls  in front of a spotlight.  There's a couple of hot girls  from Chicago.  I know, but it's just like  this huge spotlight.  Dallas does the same thing.  There's too much light going on.  You notice what Rick was doing?  He adjusts the lighting  and then he took a picture  of her just completely clothed  against the wall.  It's called the test shot.  And he goes,  that's the test shot.  And then he shows it to her. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah, you happy with this?  I didn't notice that.  I was too busy noticing Rick  pretty much molesting  our contestant.  And the girl's really...  She's very lovely.  And Jim...  Jim feels like a complete zero.  No, I don't feel like  a complete zero.  I am one.  You picked the worst day  to wear that stupid,  big, oversized,  red Spider-Man shirt.  That intern that gave it to me,  if you're listening,  I hope you fall into a glass hole.  Well, she gave me  this red Spider-Man shirt 
[03:15:30]  with a Dr. Pepper logo  and I'm out there  talking to a ten.  Who leaves their house  in a Spider-Man t-shirt?  Dude, feety pajamas  would be more sexy  and masculine.  I look like such  a chubby retard right now.  And that's got to be  like an extra, extra, extra large.  They're taking a picture  from the website.  I'm a 33-year-old man  trying to talk to a nine  dressed like...  I'm like a two.  You came up to me  at one point.  Hey, don't flatter yourself.  Jim comes up to me  and he goes,  he goes,  I suck. 
[03:16:00]  I go, what's the matter?  Because I'm figuring  it's something with the computer  or the phone again.  He goes,  I'm standing here,  I'm dressed like  an eight-year-old  and I have no rap.  I can't talk to this girl.  I'm just staring at the floor  like,  why did I wear this?  Jim, I wouldn't even  wear that shirt  on laundry day.  Dude, this shirt stinks  and all it stinks...  And don't wash it  with anything  or everything will be pink.  You look like  you're ready to go  on the short bus  with your little hockey helmet  at a great adventure  for a special day.  Why would I...  And this is the nerve 
[03:16:30]  of me to even try.  You can see my...  I look good in a baggy shirt  if the wind is at my back  and you can't see  my fat Liberty Bell  stomach hanging over.  Local reference.  Very nice.  Yeah, Philly.  Philly's happy.  Yeah, they're really excited  at the Liberty Bell  local reference.  It's like us talking  about the Statue of Liberty  in New York.  I love these idiots  that IM me on the computer  and write,  Hey, dude,  you must get laid a lot.  No, being funny  is meaningless.  I mean, they laugh,  but, oh.  Yeah.  Never gets you, girl.  And what do you have  a problem with your shoes?  No, there's no problem 
[03:17:00]  with my shoes  when you're trying  to wrap to a tank.  You shouldn't be wearing  black flipper-like shoes.  Yeah, where did you get those?  Me and Dice bought them together.  We were in Vegas.  It was a thing we gave.  They were comfortable.  Stop.  I'm telling you.  Stop.  That's what happened.  Everything Dice buys  for you or us,  it stinks.  No, these are comfortable.  I paid for them.  Let me take a look.  Yeah, but he convinces  all of us to buy things  that just look stupid on us.  But, dude,  these are really comfortable.  If they were pointy  at the tip,  they just need those bells,  the jester bells.  Look how they go up  like a ramp.  That's like the Iron Sheik. 
[03:17:30]  Hey, someone wants to know  if you're wearing  matching green lantern underwear.  He's got underoos on.  You know what?  So why would you  leave the house with that?  I don't know.  It's not even a nice red.  It's like an orange red.  It's a bright red.  I put it on,  and I'm like,  you can't do this.  And then I'm like,  well, I'm going to go home,  and I've got a set tonight,  so I'll go home and shower  and put on another shirt.  Are you trying to get noticed  on the streets of Manhattan?  No!  Hey, look,  I was in this movie.  Spider-Man shirt.  I was in the movie.  Are you working it now?  I think you know  I'm better than that.  With a big Dr. Pepper logo 
[03:18:00]  on your shoulder.  No, I'm not.  Where did you get  that shirt?  At McDonald's?  Dude, if you got  an extra wow shirt,  this one is going  in the dumpster,  and I'm not even wearing it home.  I can't believe  I put this on.  And I realized  that as I'm talking to her...  Hey, get the girl in here.  This should be fun.  She's 20 years old  and really hot  from outside Philly.  What's her name, anyway?  We've been calling her  a hot piece of egg.  Disturbing Rick's photo shoot.  That's all right.  Get her in.  You don't have to put  your shirt on.  Who cares?  We've seen millions of them. 
[03:18:30]  Hey, look at that.  Hey, how you doing?  Hi, guys.  Hey, holy Toledo.  She's all topless for you, Jim.  Nice.  Now her bands are zipped down,  and she's got the front of her  very short jean shorts down  so you can see  the top of her panties.  Isn't that cute?  I am looking at about  eight inches of flesh  between the belly button  and the panty top,  which means we are almost  at ground zero.  Ground zero.  Little tennis socks.  Hey, Rick,  what do you call that pose?  What pose?  The I'm-gonna-get-divorce pose. 
[03:19:00]  What does that mean?  Well, he names all his shots.  I'm wondering what he calls this shot.  It's new.  It's new.  It's new.  I just invented it today.  It's new.  It's called  My Wife's Gonna Take Half.  It's called Rick.  Why weren't you effing listening?  You're insane.  What?  I didn't do...  Have I done anything wrong to you?  Pull your pants down.  I liked it.  Wow.  What did Rick do to you?  Anything? 
[03:19:30]  He sprinkled some water on me.  Yeah, he does that.  Yeah.  Where did it come from?  This pose is called  I Don't Think My Wife Will Mind.  Anyway, Jim Norton.  Do you like him in his little Spider-Man shirt there?  How awful is his shirt?  Be honest.  Well, it's almost as bad as the movie.  I didn't see the film.  Oh, gee, he was in that movie.  All right, can I tell you what's going on, hot, naked girl?  What's your name, by the way?  Jeanette.  Jeanette.  Jim really wants to just talk to you.  Nothing crazy, but he's feeling like a big zero because of... 
[03:20:00]  Hold on, hold on.  Look at the picture of Jim in his shirt that's going to go off on the site.  It is the worst picture I've ever seen of you.  It is the worst picture I've ever seen of you.  You look retarded in this picture.  Gee, you think?  Either that or you just made it through chemo.  Look at this picture, Jim.  Look how awful you look.  Let me see.  That is bad.  He might slit his wrist.  That is bad.  Look at that picture. 
[03:20:30]  Oh, she's going to giggle at you.  You know what you should do?  Put that on foundry.  Every girl I ever talked in a bang in me should see that and put a bullet in their head.  Every girl I ever tricked into dropping my ears.  Hey.  What a fat pig I look like.  So, hot piece of A.  What do you think of Jim in this shirt, really?  Really?  I don't like the shirt.  Thank you.  You shouldn't.  Would you ever, like, even go out on a date with a guy that showed up with a shirt like  that?  I wouldn't wear the shirt on a date.  No, she's sitting at that.  I didn't plan on meeting a nine and a half today.  I figured I'd just come in.  Not meeting girls here? 
[03:21:00]  I mean, Jesus Christ.  Jim, look at Ant and I.  We always dress up because you just never know.  You're not dressed up.  You're wearing a plain gray t-shirt.  I mean, she's still...  Hello?  Compared to me, you look good.  I have a nice little number going here.  You don't.  Compared to you?  Yeah, compared to me, exactly.  But don't act like you're wearing a t-shirt.  Dude, I've seen homeless people dress better than that.  This is awful.  I wore that on my wedding day.  Can't believe I have a Dr. Pepper logo trying to wrap with a guy.  He was so upset.  And not saying... 
[03:21:30]  I'm not even saying like he was really putting a move on here.  He just wanted to go over and talk to you outside.  He walked up to you and he turns away two seconds later.  He came up to me and said, I'm nothing.  Look at me in my stupid shirt.  Like, he couldn't even get talking to you.  Just the nerve of me to wrap the hair topless in this shirt.  You like soda, do you?  I could never.  This should have an HIV cocktail written on the side.  A little fat nothing.  Yeah.  Wow. 
[03:22:00]  Very nice.  Hey, new girl up?  Two more girls have entered the WOW contest on opianthony.com.  Two girls representing Philly.  And there's controversy.  Does she go in as a New York representative or Philly?  New York.  Oh.  So if the girls...  I would say New York.  If the girls come to New York, they represent New York?  Because we have...  Hold on.  We have another girl from Philly.  Taylor, what's up?  Hi.  How are you guys?  Pretty good.  Real fast.  Go ahead.  Um, I'm coming up on Monday to get my pictures taken, too, because I don't have any confidence 
[03:22:30]  in the guys at YSP, either.  Wow.  We love when the girls...  I'll be up on Monday.  We love when the girls make the road trip to New York for their pictures.  So...  I'll be up.  We'll see you Monday, okay?  All right.  All right.  See ya.  Bye.  So they do go in under New York.  Why not?  All right.  All right.  So she's going on...  That's good.  We got her under our belt now.  There you go.  Hopefully she's hot and I can dress like another superhero next Monday.  Yeah, what shirt are you there?  I don't know, I'm going to be wearing a cape.  The Hulk movie's coming out.  Maybe you can get an advanced shirt. 
[03:23:00]  A really bright green shirt.  Yeah.  Look, if I only had muscles...  Jim, you're starting to make money.  Why the silly shirt?  I just put it on.  I didn't...  I just walked.  Jimmy, do you have some good clothes?  I work...  Perform seven nights a week, so I make sure that those clothes are a little bit better.  But I wear T-shirts on stage.  You do.  I know.  I've seen that.  I figure I shouldn't have to dress up to be funny.  But is there any day where you just go, all right, I'll put on this.  You know, some nice pants, nice shirt kind of thing.  So this is what an OCD zero I am.  My nice clothes, I always... 
[03:23:30]  I won't put on just until I know I'm going to need them.  Because I'm like, I might need them and then they'll be dirty.  So I leave them in the closet.  I really have a mental closet.  You can have them cleaned after you wear them.  I do.  There's a cleaner in my building and I never use it.  Oh, Jesus.  Hey, everyone...  There's signs there.  Everyone is begging to see Jim's shirt.  If we can get up immediately, because then we can get some comments.  I'll work on this.  So we can make Jimmy feel real good today.  Thank you, hot piece of A.  Bye, guys.  All right.  There she goes, Jimmy.  She laughed at you.  I think Rick will get those pants.  She should have.  What else is new? 
[03:24:00]  She think Rick will get the pants off?  What do you think?  No?  Yeah.  Yeah?  You think he will?  We got two cute girls up on opandathlete.com.  Three new girls have entered the contest today.  One girl that we took her pictures on Friday.  Her pictures are finally up.  Contestant number 61, Katie, is pretty damn hot from YSP.  And...  Jim, if you could turn toward the...  Yeah, of course.  I'd be happy to.  And back up a little, because I kind of want a little more of Jimmy Norton in this picture. 
[03:24:30]  All right.  Move the mic away.  There it is.  Will you freeze it?  Will you freeze it?  All right.  Let's see how this is going to work.  Is it up?  And put a picture of her next to it so they can see exactly what hit on what.  Hey, yeah.  Get her in here.  Get the contest.  Oh, oh.  Good idea.  Good idea.  Get her just looking at your shirt as she's topless and have her laugh at you.  Well, you can have coffee.  I would change the shirt.  Huh?  Yeah.  I believe this shirt's getting thrown out before I leave the studio. 
[03:25:00]  You got the pants off.  Hey, she's...  She has just panties on now, Jim.  Holy cow.  Hey, can you get next to Jim dressed like that?  We want a contrast.  Yeah.  Just go to Jimmy.  He looks as red as his shirt is.  Now, I want you to kind of look at him and just laugh.  Okay, let's stay there for a moment.  Hold on.  Don't move.  Don't move.  Yeah, you don't move either.  Just kind of...  And there's the camera right there.  No, not on the floor.  Oh, okay.  Wait for it to reload again.  Let's see how that one looks. 
[03:25:30]  That one might be good.  Let me see.  It's...  Which one you got?  It's kind of good.  Which one you got?  I got the one...  She's showing one boob.  Kind of the side waving.  Oh, that one.  Yeah, that's good.  Okay.  We'll stop it there then.  Oh, damn it.  It might have snapped another one.  Jesus, Jimmy.  It's on the awesome camera.  Yeah, okay.  It's a different one up there now, but it's just as good.  Yeah, that'll work.  Oh, my.  Look at Jimmy with his little Spider-Man shirt. 
[03:26:00]  Terrible.  Oh, look at you.  Spider-Man.  Spider-Man.  And I'll be doing the same thing he does as soon as I go home.  I'm going to just move my hands and white stuff is going to shoot out all over the floor.  And I'll swing out my 23rd floor window and have my little fat body hit the pavement.  All right.  There you go.  It's on the awesome camera.  We got some controversy in Portland, Anthony.  Portland?  Joseph, what's up?  Hey, Jimmy, your little picture just came across the Internet. 
[03:26:30]  You're just a darling looking there.  I'm a little.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm sorry.  Hey, you guys are on the news today.  One of the local establishments that you guys read for were busted for running a little  bit of a whorehouse behind the back of the place.  I'm hearing reports that, what was it, a video store?  Yeah.  The really hot part of the story, Jim, is that the way it got busted was that a teacher  was found with an underage Hispanic male.  And then they tracked it back to getting it from there. 
[03:27:00]  Wow.  Wow.  Oh.  Is it taboo adult video?  Remember doing that read?  Yeah.  We did a read.  I mean, they throw commercials at us all the time.  And for Portland, we did one for taboo adult video.  Let me read what Mark writes from Portland.  ONA, the commercial you did for taboo adult video, made it on the local newscast this afternoon.  They were shut down due to running an escort service out of the joint.  You hear ONA's read of the commercial in the background when they introduced the story.  Really?  How great is that? 
[03:27:30]  Someone's got to get that audio for us.  I'm so psyched.  We've got to hear that.  Oh, we need that audio.  Because you know the newsreaders are all serious.  We love every time we're in the news because it's never for something good ever, ever.  Well, they're...  Yeah, no.  Well, hmm.  Even when they try to make it something good, we always get screwed.  That's true.  It's always like they make us come off like we're bad people.  Thank you.  Danny, what's up?  Hello.  Danny?  Yeah.  You all right?  You talk like I feel. 
[03:28:00]  Hello?  Yeah, dude, I'm going to a smackdown at the Fleet Center tomorrow.  I'm going to have some wow signs.  I hope we see a lot of wow signs tomorrow.  Yeah, well, they probably will in Boston, but the problem is I'm not going to be the only one,  so I was wondering if you guys had suggestions for something to put on the back.  Maybe kind of stand out a little.  You guys do a great job on your own, man.  You guys come up with some hilarious signs for the wrestling.  Oh, yeah, what?  No fags?  I don't know.  It's all been done.  Figure something out.  Look at this guy.  It's all been done. 
[03:28:30]  Oh, screw it.  You're unnotivated.  Well, because Boston's weak.  I think I'm just going to hold it.  You drive around with a wow sticker.  You never see a girl that tips.  I drive around in a truck all day.  It's like fishing.  I've never got wowed.  Well, maybe if you had a little more enthusiasm, Danny.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, thanks a lot, buddy.  No one's rules.  All right, bye.  I certainly don't.  Hi.  Hi.  Anthony, unlucky lottery.  Yeah.  Suspect escapes jail, is eaten by a crocodile.  How great is that? 
[03:29:00]  A 28-year-old Panamanian accused of killing a judge was eaten by a crocodile as he swam across a river after escaping from prison, police said on Thursday.  Oswaldo Martinez, guilty, accused of murdering judge Armodio Mariscal on June 5th during a failed robbery in Panama City was captured last week by police after fleeing to neighboring Costa Rica.  After being held in custody in Costa Rica, Martinez broke out of jail at the weekend, at the weekend, what does that mean?  Broke out of jail over the weekend, I guess, and was aiming to re-enter Panama through the dense jungle that divides the two Central American countries. 
[03:29:30]  Martinez was eaten alive by the crocodile on Monday as he tried to swim across the river in southern Costa Rica, according to eyewitness reports confirmed by police on Thursday.  How great is that?  Sucks to be you.  That's an unlucky lottery and a sucks to be you.  What are the odds?  Unlucky lottery, right?  Down there.  Who knows, though?  But, uh, yeah, unlucky lottery and sucks to be you. 
[03:30:00]  Thinking, I'm going to make it.  Oh, my God, I got to wait.  All I got to do is get the...  Oh, no.  Oh, I'm being eaten alive by a crocodile.  I didn't see this coming.  Fantastic.  So, that's that.  That's that, then.  That's that, then.  Well, we're trying to get Dice on the phone.  He might be in Vegas this week.  That's my only guess.  Oh, no.  Oh, I can check.  I don't have a cell phone with me.  Vegas.  I'm supposed to get a barbecue from Dice this weekend.  What do you like?  The barbecue sauce? 
[03:30:30]  What kind?  Um, the, uh...  Uh, I forgot the name of it, the, uh...  What kind?  Barbecue or mesquite?  Mesquite.  Yeah!  Yeah, mesquite.  Nice.  That'll be...  I can't wait for the stories.  Dice.  Does he wear the jacket?  Have you ever been to a barbecue with Dice?  I know you hang out with him.  I never know, because after Vegas, I would always fly home to do gigs, and he would always  go to L.A., and Kenny and Happy would go out and have the barbecue for Memorial Day  or whatever.  Just with knowing Dice, everything's a little flashier than everyone else, you know? 
[03:31:00]  He's got to be a little larger than life.  So I just picture his utensils being like, maybe there's some studs on him.  Like the back of the jacket said, Dice Rules.  Like it just says, uh, Dice and Rules on the top and bottom of the handles, maybe.  Big spatula.  Dice Rules.  A paper that says, Steak Rules.  Steak Rules!  And just like, like it's been bedazzled with rhinestones, emblazoned with the Constitution  on the front, like, going home. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah.  He really...  Everything is larger than life.  It's got to be larger than life.  He's a superhero, and he came in here with those big pants that look like his feet suck  in, and rockets shoot out the bottom of him, and his big leather jacket.  Got to give it to the guy.  He's larger than life.  We love the guy.  I just want to...  Nice!  Hey, Kelly, what's up?  Hi, how you doing?  Hey.  What's up, Kelly?  What's going on?  Tell us.  Well, I'm driving down the street a couple days ago, and I see a wow sign on the back  of the truck, so, you know, I figure, why not? 
[03:32:00]  I'm a big fan, so I'll wow him.  It's my dad and his friend that I just wowed.  Oh!  You wowed your father?  I didn't wowed my father.  Your father had the wow sticker.  Huh?  Well, didn't you recognize his car?  It wasn't his car, it was his friend.  Oh.  He was in the passenger seat.  Oh, that's great.  Your friend must have loved it, imagine that.  He would love it.  See your friend's daughter's cans as you're driving down the road?  Yeah, it's pretty embarrassing.  Turn it off!  See what you guys are doing to us?  What did he say to you? 
[03:32:30]  I haven't talked to him since.  I don't live with him, so he was pretty embarrassed of wanting to call me.  How old are you?  22.  Yeah, still daddy's little girl.  Yeah.  He's flipping through the photo out right now, whacking his bag.  All right, I just wanted to tell you guys that.  Thank you, Callie.  Bye.  Oh, Cal?  That's a great wow.  By the way, no fake O today and no 6 o'clock queef.  Come on.  The girls have let us down.  We're losing two of our best features.  Benchmarks, they call them.  I'll be benchmarks. 
[03:33:00]  It's a benchmark bit.  How'd you learn about benchmarks?  You taught me.  I learned it from you, okay?  Tiffany.  I learned it from you.  I just messaged with you today.  What's up, Tiffany?  Hello?  Tiffany!  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  What's up?  What's up?  Oh, nothing.  You guys are, like, complaining a couple days ago about how no one was calling in to  do the 6 o'clock queef or anything anymore, so I thought I'd like to call in to help  you out, you know?  Tiffany?  Well, yeah. 
[03:33:30]  Your name?  That's not my real name, duh.  Oh, what?  You're going to do the 6 o'clock queef.  Yeah, why not?  You know, you're complaining.  You haven't got anyone to do it for a while.  I thought I'd help you out, you know?  Well, hey, I think we're going to pass today.  We like when girls do it.  Well, you know, the ungrateful seas aren't helping you guys out, so I thought I'd give  you a hand here.  Hey, Tiff, did you enter the WOW contest from Philly? 
[03:34:00]  No.  Tiff.  Thanks, Tiff.  Yeah, thank you, Tiff.  It was horrible.  All right.  It's true.  Dice is playing Vegas this weekend.  That's how he is.  When will he fly out?  I don't know.  He might be there already.  He's a legend and he likes big things in big cities.  I'm not getting my barbecue.  Go to Vegas.  Huddy.  Huddy.  How's the flight over?  It's an hour.  Man, wouldn't that be great?  What's up, Huddy?  Yeah.  Yeah, what do you want, man?  I'm in a range right now.  You guys want to hear some shooting? 
[03:34:30]  You're at the range?  I'm at the range.  Where at?  We like it better when it's out your back door, but we're in a post office.  Range is cool, though.  Yeah.  What do you got?  It's kind of difficult doing that in the city, though.  What do you got today?  I'm on the range right now.  You want to hear some shooting?  Yeah, but what do you got?  What weapon?  What do you want?  45, 9, 40?  What do you have to do with the 45?  You want to hear the 45?  Yeah.  Let's go.  Hold on a second.  All right.  Ready to go?  Yeah.  We're going to do one or two regulars and then a couple of rapid fires.  All right. 
[03:35:00]  All right?  Let's go for it.  I've got to get my ears on.  Hold on a second.  Rack it up.  Ready?  Go for it.  A lot of echo at the range.  I'll say.  A little busy over there.  How'd you do?  How'd I do?  What do you mean?  When you shoot rapid fire, you hardly hit crap.  Yeah, I know.  You've got to be like a gangster.  Hold it sideways.  Yeah, hold it sideways.  That's when you hit the innocent bystander targets to the side of your intended target.  Holding your gat. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah.  All right, man.  If you want another mag, I can go right now.  What do you got?  Oh, I can hear some 9 now.  All right.  Let's hear the 9.  The truth is, I'm indoors, so it all sounds the same.  Yeah.  We're going to go for it at 9 right now.  Go for it.  Waste it.  All right.  Let's hear it.  Gunfire.  Wow.  Yeah, I like that.  Very nice.  Anybody else wet?  Good job, honey.  Thank you, guys.  All right, we got a lot of controversy. 
[03:36:00]  The people from Philly are very pissed off at us.  Jim, what's up?  Jim.  Yeah.  Go, real fast.  Hey, man, the girls should be from Philly, not from New York, man.  We're hurting here.  We need everything we can get from Philly.  You guys are hurting there.  I mean, you know, I got to tell you, and I'm telling you, okay, we are hurting.  We need every little bit of help we can get from Philly.  And the hottest girl from Philly decided to come to New York, so now she's going to represent 
[03:36:30]  New York.  Right.  That's right, man.  Philly is so pissed.  But either that or you've got to give us Rick.  We have to have some sort of chain in there.  Philly is so pissed.  Look at the phones.  They're like, come on, guys.  Girls from Philly should take their pictures in Philly.  They should represent Philly.  No, it's where they have the picture taken.  Yeah, because we stole a couple girls from D.C., too.  Yeah.  That sucks.  Sucks to be you.  All right, Jim.  Thanks.  Bye.  Bye.  Well, it'll fool everybody.  Right. 
[03:37:00]  I don't know what that means.  Okay, what do we learn next?  Wow, look at that.  Yeah, we did good today, considering we're in vacay mode.  Jim, you want a Powerpuff Girl t-shirt?

You look awful. 
[03:37:30]  Of course I do.  You say that like it's a shock.  Spider-Man looks like he's getting ready to attack your yam.  I know.  He's crawling down.  Yeah.  He's, like, crawling down his web on your shirt, and he's crawling toward your junk.  He looks like he's clinging to my fat, awful stomach, and he's ready to fall off.  I'm sure at some point he'll make a left and grab that Dr. Pepper on your sleeve.  Yeah.  Boop, boop, boop.  All he's got to do, push the web out and grab that Dr. Pepper.  That's horrible.  It's awful.  And, like I said, don't wash it with anything. 
[03:38:00]  That kind of red, that kind of red will just make your underwear pink.  Other things do that.  The whole thing, not just the back.  Big pink stain on the back.  Oh, that was a rough night.  Hey, uh-oh.  The cities are starting to fight, Ant.  We love when the cities start fighting.  Yeah.  Yes, Rich.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  Listen, you think Philly now knows how the Fred Sox feel about New York taking the best talent away?

Why would I be grateful?  If you would have handed me a wet bag of manure, that would have helped me get laid more than this shirt. 
[03:46:30]  Do you know how much Dr. Pepper I had to drink for that shirt?  All right, so you did make that type of a sacrifice, but you didn't do it for me.  I brought it in for you because you were in the movie.  I brought it in.  Who else wanted it in the show?  Oh, John wanted it.  I'll take it off and give it to him.  He's gonna have it.  Why do you think I gave it away?  It's the ugliest thing I've ever seen.  I know.  It's awful.  It's awful.  But you're ungrateful.  I'm not ungrateful.  I'm real.  He is.  I know I'm a zilch, and I know this doesn't help. 
[03:47:00]  All right.  Well, you're welcome.  Thank you, Kim.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's start.  What did we learn?  That was two wasted phone calls.  Sean, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  Hey, Sean.  Norton, where are you?  I'm right here.  Hey, Pookie Bear.  Hi, Angel.  You know what I learned today?  I learned that the fags keep the shwoogies out of Boston.  We did learn that.  Love you, Sean.  Love you, Ben. 
[03:47:30]  There's some great whatever you learned today.  Hey, Bobby Bigrager, what's going on?  What's going on?  Oh, man.  Hey.  Sweet cheeks over there.  Hey, I learned that the money can't buy you love, but in Anthony's case, it only costs  them $300.  That's...  Oh.  Hey.  There's something on here every day.  Oh, my God.  Jerry, what's going on?  How you doing, guys?  Good.  Today, I learned faggots are the best deterrent for crime activity and gang wars. 
[03:48:00]  Love you, Norton.  See you, buddy.  I love you, too.  What a love fest.  Yeah, every guy loves me because I represent what they know, you know, we all feel.  That's it.  Idiotic.  What?  What?  Do you understand?  I didn't clarify that, but that's why guys like me, because I'm the same zero they are,  and they all wear shirts like that.  No, no, no, but it doesn't have to be.  Todd, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, today I learned you can own your own black girl just like the first Civil War. 
[03:48:30]  Very true.  Wow.  And a funny wedding would be a conga line gets hit by an explorer.  Thank you, Todd.  Yeah.  Ray from Boston is saying, poor Jimmy, that is so effing funny, he looks like a 12-year-old  boy that collects Pokemon cards.  I guess they saw your picture up on the awesome cam.  I'd have to assume so.  Peter, what's up?  Hi.  Yeah, I learned Anthony was married in the Baroque era.  Yes. 
[03:49:00]  Very nice.  Take it easy.  Jimmy, you rule no matter what the shirt says.  Thank you, buddy.  Some fine artists have come from the Baroque era.  Sure.  Name one.  Ugh.  Bobby, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  I learned one quick rule is a good thing.  Yeah.  I learned that if you're in a wheelchair and if they can't see over you, pay your picture  on the stick.  Oh, Bobby.  Oh.  Type balloons.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, no, Maverick.  He punched out Maverick.  Boy, did you clumsily trip through that one.  Both engines had flamed out, but he pulled the handle.  And that's why I was laughing so hard, because it looked good on the screen. 
[03:49:30]  I know.  He said, if you're in a wheelchair, make sure you hold your head up high, and if that's  not good enough, make sure you have your face on a little cardboard with a stick so you  can show the person that it's you.  But he was like the lawyer in My Cousin Vinny.  He just bumbled and muttered.  He knew that.  Butterin' muterin'.  That's half the battle.  Lou, what's up?  Hey, listen.  I learned today that a bison will mate with a Dalmatian.  I did learn that.  Oh, my God.  Very good.  Let's go to Awesome Andy from Boston. 
[03:50:00]  Awesome Andy.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Listen, I learned that Anthony bought his wedding ring from some skinny Ethiopian outside  of Penn Station.  No, inside Penn Station.  Which is even worse.  Yeah.  Oh, that's even worse, Anthony.  Of course it is.  Of course it is.  I told you that.  Time flies when you're in therapy.  Yeah, that was a therapy session.  Without a doubt.  Well overdue.  Wren, what's up?  Wren?  Yeah, I can't go to my favorite jack shack in Portland anymore to the Summit Center. 
[03:50:30]  The school children and the teachers.  That's how it works.  Yeah, Portland, you got a homework assignment.  You got to get the audio if they run it on the news again so we can play it tomorrow  on the show.  The jack shack.  The jack shack that got busted.  The one that we've been promoting on our show.  Man, there were some good ones, but they're all like...  We didn't even get to do the I Miss on Larry King thing, by the way.  It's a teaser.  John, what's up? 
[03:51:00]  Damn.  Hey, guys, what's up?  I learned today, when I break out of prison in South America, make sure I have a getaway  boat.  Yeah, don't try to walk it.  All right, you guys suck.  Have a good one.  All right.  Oh, man.  Dying here.  You're like finishing strong.  Got anything over there, Alex?  I'm scanning.  Well, Mr. Blonde learned it's not rape if there's a ring on the finger.  He also learned sea-doos don't solve marriage problems. 
[03:51:30]  No.  But they're a lot of fun.  Al Mack from Clifton.  Today, I learned that Anthony's wedding was one step above a spicknick.  Flaming arrow from Staten Island.  See, we should have went right to the S&P back there.  Yep.  Today, I learned that it only takes one.  I learned a 30-year-old man wearing a Spider-Man t-shirt looks stupid.  That's Tiffany in Redding.  He's right.  When you step off the curb, you've gone too far.  Thank you, sheep lover. 
[03:52:00]  Yeah, we gave out this.  It was wrong before.  Hardcore will be on Encore July 9th at 2.10 a.m.  So, set the TiVo or VCR.  Sucks to be you, Rich Voss.  Unlucky lottery, Voss's parents.  That's from Gizmo.  It's not even here.  Poor Voss, man.  I've got to get past.  Happy birthday to Voss.  Is it his birthday?  I guess.  I've heard things.  I heard it was his birthday recently.  Oh, wow.  You've jacked next to him in a bed with a girl between the two of yous, 
[03:52:30]  and you don't even know his birthday.  At least you can do is send a card.  I don't know.  She never had a candle on her, so I just figured that it would.  All right.  I guess that's how it ends today.  That sucks.  That's it.  Sometimes the what have we learned?  Yeah, they don't come in.  I guess it wasn't as educational a program as I thought.  I want to thank the hot blonde from Philly for driving all the way to New York  to get her pictures done for the Wow Contest.
