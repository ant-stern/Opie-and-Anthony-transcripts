<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with introductions and the phone number announcement.  The hosts immediately launched into a discussion about their new, tardy intern, Ryan, who apologized with a 30-pack of Sam Adams beer, a gesture Opie and Anthony deemed “kiss-ass.”  They then segued into a Ripley’s Believe It or Not story about a man who had his penis reconstructed using his middle finger after cancer, provoking a graphic discussion and a flurry of listener calls.  This transitioned into a heated debate surrounding Spin Magazine's list of the 50 greatest bands of all time, with numerous omissions (The Doors, Queen, The Police, Van Halen, Aerosmith) generating angry listener feedback.  The discussion veered off into tangents including Michael Jackson’s digitally altered appearances in a special, neck-stretching tribal practices, and their planned visit to the Mutter Museum.  Caller Ed interrupted to complain about a fireman-only virginity contest planned for the show.  Further discussion of the Spin list included playing song snippets and humorous banter, culminating in the reveal of the Beatles as the number one band.  The show featured a contentious phone interview with Robert Clary of *Hogan's Heroes*. Opie repeatedly made offensive jokes about Clary's sexuality and his Holocaust experiences, prompting Clary to threaten to hang up multiple times before ultimately doing so.  Anthony attempted damage control, but Opie's offensive remarks continued.  The aftermath of this interview involved shocked, amused, and outraged listener reactions.  A caller mentioned Flavor Flav's incarceration in Rikers Island.  The show concluded with a call from a woman identifying as a midget, Anna, who offered to show herself and dildos on camera to promote her website, and Opie smashing a Rolling Stones pinball machine gifted to him by Al Dukes, producer of the following show, Ron and Fez.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Don't be scared to call our show.  No, never.  That guy was an exception.  He was a tool.  He was an idiot.  Most of our fine listeners know what they're doing when they call this radio show, right?  Slow down.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else.  Just anywhere else today.  Just anywhere.  I'll throw a bone.  Sacramento.  I'll be here.  Including Sacramento. 
[00:00:30]  866-277-4WOW.  That's 866-277-4WOW.  Wow.  Hey.  We got new gay Marco sounds.  The sad Marco from yesterday.  Want to thank you for calling yesterday to help us out with the radio program.  Becky.  How are you, Anthony?  Great.  Great.  Lovely spring day here in New York City.  Oh, yeah.  Kind of nice.  I like the global warming thing. 
[00:01:00]  Excellent.  Yeah.  You're keeping me happy.  I, um...  I got to talk about something I saw last night on, uh, Ripley's Believe It or Not.  Can I say something before that?  Yeah.  Because I want to have...  I want to be able to focus and listen to what you have to say today.  Okay.  Our new intern's a whack job.  And I think the people that are hiring our new interns should stop smoking pot before  they do it. 
[00:01:30]  What's his name?  He's right here.  It's Brian.  What's your name?  Brian.  Brian?  No, not Brian.  We had a Brian.  You don't want to be another Brian.  That's Ryan.  Brian.  We're getting ready for the radio show and, uh, Brian, the new intern, walks in.  It's Ryan.  What?  Ryan.  I said Ryan.  Okay.  Why didn't I take it short?  Oh, my God.  He's already talking back.  Talking back.  Oh, my God.  Sorry.  Talking back. 
[00:02:00]  You didn't hear me say Ryan after I said Brian and they said, no, it's Ryan.  Then I said Ryan and you said, no, it's Brian.  No, I didn't hear you.  My fault.  It's Ryan.  Brian was late on his first day.  That happens.  What, traffic or something?  Yeah, his train was late.  That was a train.  The train was the downfall of Brian, wasn't it?  So he couldn't get the trains?  No, that was, uh, who was that intern?  Uh, Jesse.  Jesse, that's right. 
[00:02:30]  The power went out of, like, all of New Jersey.  Yeah.  And prevented him from getting to the job.  So Ryan walks in all disheveled as Ann and I are just kind of discussing what we want  to do on the show today.  We were left alone in the office for a few minutes, which was nice.  And, uh, Ryan...  I was perusing pornography.  Well, yeah.  And, uh, Ryan walks in and all disheveled and pretty stressed out.  Yeah, I was.  Because, uh, you were late on your first day, right?  Yes.  So what did you say to Ann and I?  I said, uh, to make up for me being late. 
[00:03:00]  No, no, man.  Start from the beginning.  I didn't know who you were at first.  Oh, I said, hello, I'm the new intern.  Yeah.  My name's Ryan.  And I said, for being late, uh, I got you guys a 30-pack of beer.  30-pack.  30-pack.  30-pack.  Nice.  What about a six-pack?  Uh, I got five, uh, six-packs.  You're a college kid, right?  Yes.  Do you have 50 bucks to spend just because the train was late?  Uh, no, not really, but I thought I should do it because I was late.  Oh, no.  There you go.  Dude, I gotta tell you, we don't like kiss-asses.  All right.  Don't kiss our ass. 
[00:03:30]  Six-pack would have been a nice little gesture.  30-pack.  50 bucks.  Where'd you get the beer?  Right here in Manhattan, right?  Right here in Manhattan, associate.  Sam Adams, Anthony.  None.  He bought Sam Adams, something we get for free.  I know.  We had just gotten a delivery of about 10 cases, wasn't it?  We have about 10 cases of Sam Adams.  Yeah.  But Ryan, he was late and figured he had to make it up to us, so he bought a 30-pack of  Sam Adams for 50 bucks.  That's a nice joke.  That's all your money for the week, right?  Probably, yeah.  He's got 10 bucks left. 
[00:04:00]  Didn't do that.  All right.  No more kiss-assing, okay?  All right.  Or Opie, we'll hit you with a mouth.  No, I'm not going to hit anyone.  You don't want to wear eye patches, do you?  No, I don't.  At any time?  Good, good.  That's a good thing.  A lot of people asking on instant feedback.  What did Mary say?  Mary, what?  Mary is still pissed.  I'm just kidding.  We worked out our differences.  Is Mary still mad at you yelling at her?  She goes, or he'll call him an idiot.  Yeah.  We worked.  I apologize.  I'm just kidding.  What a doodle.  You apologize. 
[00:04:30]  You need me to apologize on the air?  No, it's okay.  Behind the scenes, I knew I was like snappy to Mary when she was trying to do the wiffle  ball bat challenge the other day.  But we dumped out three times because of how she was describing what was going on.  I'm sorry.  And I got exasperated.  Can you tell I got one of those calendars for Christmas, a new word every day?  Exasperated?  I worked in Hue yesterday and ogled the other day.  You're a dork. 
[00:05:00]  Jesus Christ.  All right.  Well, and I apologize to you off air, right?  What do you think of the new...  Yes, I actually even said that you apologized multiple times to me.  All right.  What do you think of the new guy?  You're never at a loss for words.  What do you think?  Dude, 50 bucks?  Exactly.  I don't have...  I barely have enough money to pay for...  Like, I get mad that I have to pay for my train fare just to get here, but 50 bucks  on top of that.  Are you one of those rich spoiled kids?  No, I'm not.  No.  No.  Because we don't like them either. 
[00:05:30]  He buys beer in Manhattan.  That's like...  Yeah, that's expensive stuff, man.  10 bucks a six pack.  And you're an intern.  Where are you going to school?  Seton Hall.  Seton Hall.  There you go.  You know, Matt, on line eight, he's got a good one.  You know, poor Stinky.  Stinky started as an intern.  Yeah.  He's moved his way up the corporate ladder.  Certainly has.  He really has, though, man.  Yes.  The guy, no joking, kicks ass now.  But remember his first day here on the O.P. Anthony show, there's only one reason we  call him Stinky, and it's not because he smells... 
[00:06:00]  No.  It was because of the smelly food he brought in the first day.  Right.  For some reason, we thought he smelled.  But it turned out it was the food that smelled.  Uh-huh.  But we thought that odor was coming off his body.  But once you make a nickname of Stinky, that is probably the stickiest nickname you'll ever  find.  Right.  So he's now known as Stinky.  Yeah.  A lot of people don't know his real name's Garrett.  Garrett.  He wants us to introduce him to ladies as Garrett and not Stinky, though, by the way.  This is Garrett.  Garrett. 
[00:06:30]  So I think we've got to, you know, name the new intern.  And I think Matt's got the name.  Matt, what's up?  Um, I think kiss ass will do just fine.  Oh, good.  Yes.  Yes.  It's got to stick.  Like Stinky.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thanks, guys.  Our new intern, kiss ass.  Thanks, guys.  You named him, Matt.  Thank you.  That's it.  Thanks.  I predict, uh, we tell him to go home about two months from now.  Oh, Ralph, what's up? 
[00:07:00]  What's up, brothers?  How are you guys doing today?  All right.  Hey, man.  Uh, being this guy's such a kiss ass, it's kind of a little reminiscent of the Al Dukes  syndrome going on here.  When are you going to smash the beer?  You know what?  I think Anthony would smash me over the head with a mallet if I smashed the beer.  That's understandable.  You can't smash beer.  We can't waste beer.  We can't have enough beer.  And I want people to know, once again, we enjoy gifts.  If they're presented to us in the proper fashion.  The gifts are good, but you don't know how to get from a hole in the wall, you know?  I got a great Kurt Cobain poster hanging up in our office now from Philadelphia.  Loved it. 
[00:07:30]  I'm eagerly awaiting.  Brained at everything.  Eagerly awaiting the T2 pinball machine.  Right.  Nice.  That would be a nice gift, and we will not be smashing that.  Yeah.  All right, Ralph.  Thank you.  Thanks a lot, guys.  You guys rule.  All right.  And let's go to Charlie, and then we'll move on to what Anthony wanted to start the program  with.  I was a little distracted by that.  Oh, sure.  I kiss ass over here.  Charlie.  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I thought maybe Ryan was trying to keep up with the tavern motif, you know, by bringing  all the beer.  Yeah.  I'm restocking the tavern's beer.  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe he's your beer guy now. 
[00:08:00]  Hmm.  All right.  If he wants to bring in beer every week, that would be fine.  Yeah.  Thank you, Charlie.  He could be a bartender, too, you know?  You guys can get the whole thing going.  No, we got the obnoxious Bacardi bartenders.  Oh, hopeless bartenders.  Annoying.  Thank you, Charlie.  All right.  All right, man.  All right.  So, let's go back to Anthony.  I'm sorry, Anthony.  That's all right.  Last night, the show Ripley's Believe It or Not, you ever see this?  Yeah, of course.  I guess Dean Cain hosts it.  It is one of the most disgusting shows ever.  They're the people that brought you the guy with the face cancer that had the snap-on nose. 
[00:08:30]  You know, remember that guy?  Snap-on face?  He had the snap-on, like, nose.  Oh, yeah, because it was a hole right in the middle of his face.  It wasn't just the nose, yeah.  Yeah, it had, like, flaps where the face met the nose.  Right.  And he'd snap it on.  It went, pew, pew, like, snaps on.  Really disgusting stuff.  Well, they must really be trying to get viewers, because last night's show, they go to commercials,  and they're teasing their next segment, and they go, a man lost his penis to cancer. 
[00:09:00]  So you're just like, what?  Huh?  Can you lose your penis to cancer?  You're like a dog.  You go, huh?  Huh?  And you kind of look, and they go, we'll show you how they turned his middle finger into a new penis.  That's awful.  What the?  Who the?  Who thought of this?  Are you serious?  Dude, the guy lost his schween to the big C. 
[00:09:30]  The big casino, Tony.  Oh.  Tony.  Tony, I got to talk to Dr. Kennedy.  I got penis cancer, Tony.  They're going to take my bony middle finger and make a new one, Tony.  So they had to take his middle finger off.  Yeah, and they, like, removed the bone out of it.  Crack my knuckle.  I hate that.  And they used what was left of his middle finger without the bone and everything. 
[00:10:00]  They popped the fingernail off and kind of tried to reshape it.  And they sew it on for his schween.  Oh, I'd rather not have any.  Would you?  Put your middle finger up.  You want to be sporting that?  I know.  That's pretty sad.  You want to be sporting that?  That is really sad.  If you're going to do that, can't you take three of my fingers and bundle them up like a Hydra?  You're just sitting there with the multiple, bundle them up. 
[00:10:30]  Look, you put the three fingers together.  Now you're talking.  You could use your thumb.  It would be a little fatter but even more pathetic lengthwise.  Right.  I think.  But, man, there's a desperation move.  Because what are you going to do?  You know?  All right.  Here's your options.  We could turn you into a chick.  You know?  We'll have a sex change.  And your friends can bang you.  Or, I'm thinking we cut your finger off and sew it on in its place.  Oh, man.  And what could you have possibly done in your previous life that God would feel justice in giving you cancer of the sea? 
[00:11:00]  It's just a cancer you don't hear much about.  No.  You hear about the bully cancer.  Oh, but the whole thing.  Tom, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I watched our show, Anthony.  Man, that was the most disturbing thing.  And they said that the guy's got all the function.  He could have orgasms and everything, man.  Yeah, I'm not buying that.  I know.  And I hope he has a big finger on top of everything. 
[00:11:30]  Because, I mean, did you see the guy with the face?  Hold on.  We're on in 18 cities right now.  Everyone take a look at their middle finger.  Who has a hung middle finger?  If your finger is comparable to your junk, you're in a sad situation.  Did you know what the doctor said?  The reason that they use the finger is because it bends up and it bends down.  Yeah.  It was so sick.  And the guy with the face was even worse.  Wait, wait, wait.  It bends up and down.  So, wait.  Hold on. 
[00:12:00]  So, when it straightens out, it straightens out at the knuckle.  Oh, my God.  It was sick.  It was so sick, man.  I thought it was just going to be in a...  He could do everything they said, too.  That was the crazy part.  He could still function.  Wait, so they were going to make believe it would...  Oh, how can we explain this and get down there?  When he gets all around.  I thought it was just going to be in one permanent position.  Let's just put it that way.  No.  But he has the option to be up and down?  Up and down it goes.  Oh, yeah.  And it's that he had a hard time when he first got the penal cancer because, like, in the town that he lives, like, the men are known for, like, you know, whatever. 
[00:12:30]  Like, there were a lot of chicks, I guess.  And they would maybe tease him.  It was a manly small town.  All right, thank you, Tom.  So you're getting a first base or a second base and a home run at the same time.  Or is that third base?  Stinky Pinky.  Stinky Pinky.  Joey, what's up?  Yeah, what's up, pal?  Hey.  All right.  How does the guy pee? 
[00:13:00]  All right.  That's a legitimate question.  How does he do it?  Oh, they drill a hole?  It's like, how do they do that?  Yeah, they put something through there.  I guess the urethra.  Yeah.  And does he have to cut his fingernail every once in a while or something?  No, they get rid of the fingernail.  Oh, man.  I'll let it have my big toe.  He's nice and thick.  You know something?  You just imagine having to sit your girl down after you've been seeing each other for a little while  and maybe you're thinking about hitting the sack.  You know, I like how...  I've got to tell you this.  I like how they can reshape an ear and reshape maybe your nose or something, but... 
[00:13:30]  But stop.  Well, they grew the nose.  Remember when they showed, when they grew the nose on the guy's forehead when he got frostbite?  Yeah.  Why can't they do that on his forehead?  Yeah, they built a nose on the guy's forehead.  Why not just grow a new one like they do with the noses?  Or grow it on the mouth like they grew the ear.  Or something.  Do something nice for the poor thing.  Imagine growing out of the top of your head for a while.  You've got to...  It's growing.  All right, Joe.  Thank you.  All right, fellas.  Yeah, so that's just medical technology gone crazy. 
[00:14:00]  Man, you've got to have a lot of confidence to, you know, to whip that out after that surgery.  If you need a new C, just cut off my arm and leave the fingers on.  Just use your forearm.  Why not?  At least it could be frightening.  Why not?  In another way.  Can you get carpal tunnel penis if he bangs too much?  Yeah, that show is just strictly for shock value.  Well, it's the freak show.  Yeah. 
[00:14:30]  Joey, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I was watching that with my girlfriend last night.  Anthony, did you catch the part where they were stretching out those ladies' necks?  Yeah, you know those tribes?  Where they put the brass rings around their neck since they're kids, and it stretches their necks to ridiculous levels.  And it's not really stretching the neck.  It's just crushing down the collarbone.  Yeah, they found that out.  Instead of stretching the neck, it crushes the collarbone down.  So it just makes it look like she's got like an 8-inch or 10-inch high neck.  But as a kid, you always heard about those tribes and whatnot. 
[00:15:00]  And if they took the rings off, their head would fall over sideways and they'd suffocate or the spinal cord would bend or something like that.  Well, they decided to do it last night with one of these women.  They took the rings off?  They took the rings off.  How?  It was sick.  She had like a 10-inch long neck.  It was pretty nasty.  And she's standing there looking.  It looked like a freak show.  She looked like one of those aliens that got out of the ship in Close Encounters.  She had this big, long neck.  And she didn't like it. 
[00:15:30]  So they made her put the ring...  She made the people put the rings back on.  It's all bruised and nasty skin underneath.  Really sick.  It's a freak show.  Ripley's Believe It or Not.  Thank you, Joey.  Later, guys.  This guy's claiming that he had the surgery.  Joe!  Yo!  There's no way you had this surgery.  I'm BSing.  You want to be on...  I thought it'd add something to it.  Oh, you want...  Of course you are, you dick.  Yeah.  Because I have...  No, the guy who grew the nose on the forehead.  All right.  Enough of him.  Can't both talk. 
[00:16:00]  Bill says you have it wrong, though.  Bill, you're next to the Opie and Anthony show.  Yo, what's up, man?  Hey, man.  Yo, listen.  I was watching the show with my wife last night.  They said they used the finger to connect the nerve endings from the finger.  Yeah.  This way that would make it function.  But they made it fatter and longer.  But you see when I shaved that big patch of skin from on his thigh.  Oh.  And they made it fatter that way.  And my wife asked me...  Fatten up his schlong.  Yeah.  My wife asked me, you know, would I let them do that to me?  I said, no way, man. 
[00:16:30]  I said, if anything, if I had...  You know how they transplant, like, animal hearts and stuff?  Yeah.  I'd ask for a horse, man.  Of course.  A big horse.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Absolutely.  Thank you, man.  You guys rock, man.  All right.  Thanks.  Desperation.  Of course.  Make you do some crazy things, I guess.  Young Buck, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  You have to tell me, you guys caught that Michael Jackson special last night.  You know, I was flipping around a lot last night, but I did see a part of it, and you  want to talk about Liza Minnelli?  Oh, my God. 
[00:17:00]  What a mess that fat slob is.  Hold on a minute.  Did you notice what they did to Liza Minnelli?  What?  Have you been reading about this special?  They made Whitney Houston look bigger?  Look bigger and not sweaty as much sweat on them.  They got rid of some of the sweat.  They got rid of the protruding bones because she looks so anorexic.  Michael Jackson, they changed the color.  They changed the color?  Oh.  They changed this color on him to make him so he's not so white looking.  And they also did something else with him.  I can't remember what it was, though. 
[00:17:30]  But they were chained around everybody.  Yeah.  And Liza, I didn't see this.  I've got to see a picture of this.  Young Buck, did you notice they made her thinner?  Who?  Liza?  They stretched out the picture when she was on the screen.  Yeah.  She looked thinner, and she looked a lot like Michael Jackson.  It was really creepy.  Then there were other guys in, like, backup singers or whatever in the back.  They couldn't make her thinner anymore because they would really throw off everything.  So then she went back to fat.  So she had fat face, thin face, fat face, thin face, depending on what angle they were showing. 
[00:18:00]  I can't believe no one else picked up on that.  I've got to see this.  It was really disturbing.  She sounded like crap.  It was hysterical.  Yeah.  It really was.  The other thing, guys, South Park last night, the pony.  The what?  The pony.  Stone Pony?  No, what episode was that?  The pony in South Park last night.  South Park?  Oh, I didn't see South Park last night.  Oh, my God.  It was hysterical.  It was the one where Cartman gets revenge on the kid.  Oh, the rerun, yeah.  Yeah, he's training the pony to bite off a wiener. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  The pony starts giving the, like, scarecrows.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Don't disperse it.  I ain't going to.  They could get away with it on that show.  We can't.  Oh, my God.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  Bye.  Did Eliza look like the end credits to an old movie?  You know, they've got to squish the people really to fit the words in?  Yeah, that's exactly what it looked like.  That's what they did.  They did that with Ann Wilson of Heart.  Remember one of the last videos that Heart made when they finally gave up and then just 
[00:19:00]  smeared Vaseline on the lens?  Smeared Vaseline and stretched out.  They actually did it to the point of ridiculous, but they were using it as, like, an effect.  You know, but they were only using it on Ann.  And because she was huge at that point.  And then she's all stretched out.  She's, like, nine feet tall and a rail, a pencil rail.  I don't think it was fooling anyone, though.  Yeah.  Just like the Liza thing.  I got to see a picture of that, though.  That's kind of weird that they would do something like that. 
[00:19:30]  And it turns out.  That's my opinion.  I mean, that's what it looked like to me.  The guy that directs it or something is her boyfriend?  Yeah.  I got engaged right after the special or something.  So now that would make sense.  That's interesting.  Yeah.  Trying to make her look better or something for the playback.  Ugh.  Good luck.  All right.  Ann, we should take our first break of the show.  Spin Magazine coming out in February with the 50 greatest bands.  And we were discussing this list.  Ever, ever?  Yeah.  We were discussing this list in the back office. 
[00:20:00]  And there's a lot of surprises.  Let's just put it that way.  Let's just put it this way.  The Doors, Queen, The Police, just to name a few bands, did not make the list.  Didn't make the top 50?  No.  Fozzie did not make the list.  Scarhead did not make the list.  Fozzie.  Van Halen did not make the list.  Wow.  Alice in Chains.  The Allman Brothers.  That's interesting.  But, like, The Police did not make the list.  Aerosmith did not make the list. 
[00:20:30]  Hmm.  Spin likes to be too hip for the room sometimes.  I think this is a good example right here.  So we'll go over the list, okay?  All right.  And see what you guys think, you know?  We'll do that next.  And more of your phone calls in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-2774.  Wow.  As we go to break, remember Pablo Francisco?  He was on the show last weekend.  Oh, yeah.  He imitates the movie guy really, really well.  Mm-hmm.  And he's just a really, really funny guy.  We got a quick clip, him doing the tortilla bit. 
[00:21:00]  Cool.  Check this out.  Here they come, all together from Disney Pictures.  It can be like, you know.  Mm-mm.  In the city.  You must fight to survive.  He saw tortillas on the corner.  And the mob wanted him.  I don't know who this guy is, but I want him and his tortillas.  Dead!  He had one chance.  And his chance was to fight back.  Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Listen to me.  These tortillas, you have to get out of here. 
[00:21:30]  They're trying to kill you.  Get out!  Get out!  Little tortilla boy.  And sirens are coming everywhere.  Ah!  Just imagine a guy making you breakfast in the morning.  Two eggs are beaten beyond recognition.  Dude, you're evil.  You're evil.  Man.  Talk, talk, talk, Opie.  Talking, talking out of one's butt crack. 
[00:22:00]  Anthony.  Is a sign of personal confidence.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This show will really give you brain damage.  Oh!  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah.  Yeah, Metallica made the list, Anthony.  They did.  Good thing.  Latest issue of Spin Magazine.  I don't even know if it's out on the newsstands yet.  The 50 greatest bands of all time.  On the cover. 
[00:22:30]  Kiss!  Oh, boy.  How much did Gene Simmons get paid for the cover shot?  They came in 32nd place, though.  Kiss.  And did he pay the other guys minimum wage to show up for the shot?  And he is a hoa.  Could you shut up?  Could you stop with the noise?  Remember him that day, Ben?  He didn't like you very much.  Gene Simmons.  Metallica came in 20th place.  Metallica. 
[00:23:00]  20th greatest band of all time, Metallica.  I'm noticing a little theme with the list.  What's that?  It seems that in order to be on this list, you have to be influential in the music world.  Then why didn't the police make the list?  I know.  It's like you have to be kind of the first band of that genre.  Or just take it to a different level.  Then why didn't Fozzie make the list? 
[00:23:30]  First band of its kind.  I don't see Rotgut on this list.  Rotgut?  Come on.  I hear Scarhead was influenced by Rotgut.  Scarhead.  Wow, people are already pissed and they haven't even heard the list.  Dennis, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  All right.  What is up with this stuff?  But Spin Magazine doesn't recognize Aerosmith?  Yeah, Aerosmith didn't make the list.  Van Halen?  Van Halen did not make the list.  Yeah.  Spin likes to be a little too cool for the room, you know? 
[00:24:00]  Van Halen.  How influential was Van Halen as far as guitarists go?  Holy jeez.  That started the whole, you know, take your fingers, both hands and work the neck thing.  You know what I mean?  And I think if you have longevity like Aerosmith, you belong on a list of the 50 greatest bands of all time.  I mean, Fugazi's on the list, but Aerosmith's not.  Foo-hoo?  Yeah.  Fugazi!  Oh, my God.  What does it take when you are a band like Aerosmith for, what, 30-plus years you've been on the charts and you can't make Spin Magazines all the time? 
[00:24:30]  Like them or hate them, still getting airplay, too, you know?  Let's put it this way.  50th place, the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  I can accept that.  49th place, Pink Floyd.  Pink Floyd, only 49th place.  Yeah.  Fugazi beat out Pink Floyd.  How the hell does that have?  Craftwork.  Craftwork.  The doors are not on. 
[00:25:00]  Craftwork.  Craftwork beats out Pink Floyd.  Craftwork.  Craftwork.  Don't they open for Scarhead?  Craftwork.  And then when I was, what, like 10 in the 80s, they were at, what, hit maybe on the radio?  Bad Brains made the list at 38, but no doors, no queen, no police.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I get it.  All right, Dennis, thank you.  Hey, you guys rock, man.  Congratulations in Philly.  Yeah, well, thank you guys.  We're going to be there live two weeks from tomorrow, so we're going to have some fun. 
[00:25:30]  Very cool.  All right, thanks, Dennis.  Later.  Bye.  We've already been asked by Tim Sabian what we'd like to do for our visit in Philly.  And we're going to the Freak Show Museum.  What's the name of that place?  We're going to the Mudder Museum.  The Mudder Museum.  The Mudder.  I want to see Soap Lady or whatever.  Soap Lady.  Whatever you're telling me today.  Soap Lady.  Some woman buried years and years ago.  And the soil she was buried in contained like lye and all kinds of other ingredients that 
[00:26:00]  you'd find in old-fashioned soap.  And it slowly replaced her own flesh and whatnot.  And she's soap now.  She's laying there in this glass case.  And if you scraped it with your fingernail, a little curl of soap would come up.  She's Soap Lady.  You'd bust off a hand and wash up.  If Tim Sabian brings us to the Mudder Museum, we're going to have a whole show for everybody.  Yes.  Maybe we could go to the Slack Museum.  That's a good idea, Rick.  The Slack's Museum.  He'd probably know where that is. 
[00:26:30]  Hockey Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what up, boys?  From Cleveland.  How are you?  You got it.  Hey, I'm doing fine.  I'm doing fine.  Good to hear the ratings for Philly.  Congratulations again.  And congratulations in advance for your ratings in Cleveland.  We don't know when they come out.  I think sometime next week we'll have an update for you.  Yeah, but we here in Cleveland know what they should be if they're asking humans who they're listening to.  They're definitely feeling a buzz up in Cleveland, so we'll see what happens.  Is that what you call it?  A buzz?  A big buzz.  We'll see if it translates to some type of ratings, yes. 
[00:27:00]  My doctor called it something else, but that's all right.  All right.  So what do you have, Hockey Mike?  Hey, talk about that list of the 50 top bands.  You said they have to be influential.  What about the future chicken farmers?  That's smart.  No, they're not on the list.  Neither is Nikki with her hit song, We Deliver Keggers.  Very influential song.  Yeah.  I'll tell you.  I think about them every night.  All right.  Thank you, Hockey Mike.  Later, guys.  Cool.  Let's go to Frank who works for People Magazine.  Frank, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I'll make it quick. 
[00:27:30]  Basically, the way a list is compiled, it doesn't go by record sales or longevity, none of that crap.  You have a lot of young kids working on a staff over there.  It's who they pick.  I'm 42 years old, you know, close in age like you guys.  Pink Floyd, the Stones like that, you know, we're never going to forget them.  These guys, it's all the new stuff that's coming up.  So that's why you're saying stuff like that.  Yeah, it makes sense.  But something like this, they should just have an internet poll.  Well, you know what it is?  They're kind of slanted.  We've tried them here at People.  Right. 
[00:28:00]  You always get, you know, bombarded with, you know, favorites.  When they had the radio poll a while ago with women, they totally slaughtered it.  So they're not effective or, you know, they're really not quality ways of, you know, determining how good someone is.  All right.  But that's it, guys.  Have a great day.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Well, let's go over the list.  You know, it always starts to, people.  Well, yeah, just because you don't know who Fugazi is, you know, go F yourself.  Aerosmith made a living ripping off the Rolling Stones, so F you. 
[00:28:30]  Like, everyone gets so emotional with these lists.  There's no way there's a guy defending Fugazi.  Oh, yeah.  Swear to you, man.  It doesn't matter who made the list or didn't make the list.  That's classic.  Mike from D.C.  Fugazi is the greatest band ever from D.C.  They've been around 15 years, and the only reason people like you haven't heard about them is they are anti-commercial and don't sell out.  Therefore, they produce their own albums.  Anyone who knows anything about music know who they are. 
[00:29:00]  You know, I'm not going to fake it.  I couldn't tell you what Fugazi sings.  I couldn't tell you what genre they're in.  I couldn't either.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Well, let's go over the list really fast.  Some of the...  We'll mention some of the ones at the bottom of the list here.  Red Hot Chili Peppers in 50th place.  Pink Floyd in 49th place.  That's odd.  Korn in 48th place.  Yeah.  Leonard Skinner in 47th place.  Skinner, I could say.  A band called...  How have you not heard of them? 
[00:29:30]  Have you not heard of them?  No, I'm going to be honest with them.  Look, look.  I've heard of some of these bands on the fringes, but that doesn't mean they belong in the 50 greatest bands of ever.  I'm pretty proud when it comes to my music knowledge.  I will openly admit that I've never heard of the band Massive Attack.  Wow.  You tell me what Massive Attack is, Ben.  Massive Attack?  They're like electronics.  Well, they're not in the 50 greatest bands, but they're pretty well known.  That's just what I mean.  I mean, if you're in the 50 greatest bands of all time ever, ever, ever, I think anybody you show the list to should know every single band on that piece of paper. 
[00:30:00]  But it's exactly what it is.  So Massive Attack is better than...  No, I'm not saying that.  I'm just...  No, I'm not saying that.  Absolutely not.  Better than Eric Clapton, who didn't make the list with one of his many bands.  This list is retarded.  There's some stuff on here that doesn't make any...  Earl, have you ever heard of Massive Attack?  Yes.  Damn it.  Of course Earl did.  You're talking to Earl.  The guy is...  You would know their music a lot more than you think.  There aren't a lot of soundtracks.  There aren't a lot of... 
[00:30:30]  Commercials.  Yeah.  He emptied his mind of everything else just to fit all that musical knowledge in.  Then in that case, Tangerine Dream.  Ambition, motivation, all that.  Out.  Music.  We're talking about movie soundtracks.  What about Tangerine Dream?  I've never heard of Massive Attack.  Excuse me.  Tricky was a Massive Attack.  Whatever.  Beach Boys in 45th place.  There you go.  You know something?  I cannot stand the FN Beach Boys, but I'll say, sure, they should be on this list.  All right.  44th place, Outkast. 
[00:31:00]  Outkast!  As Earl turns his hat sideways.  Relax, Earl.  Now, come on.  Guns N' Roses, 43rd place.  At least they're on the list.  Should be a lot higher than 43rd place.  Very influential.  Very influential.  The band ahead of him, Husker Do.  Husker Do.  Husker Do.  Husker Do.  With those two dots over the U.  That's what makes the sound of E.  Doopar. 
[00:31:30]  That's deep.  Husker Do.  Now, I've heard of Husker Do.  I have.  New Order and 41st place.  I guess we might as well say all of them.  I was going to just name a few, but some of these names are worth saying on the radio.  Yeah.  Talking about the 50 greatest bands, according to Spin Magazine, the February issue that's coming out soon.  40th place, Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five.  Oh, there you go.  You forgot 41.  People are calling and going crazy.  Sorry, New Order. 
[00:32:00]  You forget one.  41st place, Grandmaster Flash, 40th.  Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five.  All right.  The next one is going to piss off a lot of people.  In 39th place of the 50 greatest bands of all time, The Who.  The Who is 39.  The Who.  The greatest bands of all time.  You know something?  If you're talking about the greatest bands of all times, the hugest bands, The Who should be up in the top ten.  You know what?  At least. 
[00:32:30]  Let me go to Andrew.  Andrew, what's going on?  Yo.  Hey.  Yeah.  I'm 19, and that guy from People Magazine, that pisses me off.  Why?  Because I know my stuff about music and everything, and he's saying that because they're young writers, that's the reason the list sucks.  And they're bad writers.  Oh, all right.  They're bad writers.  Well, you're saying, like, I'd put Floyd up there.  I'd put The Who up there.  Door, Stones, like, you know.  Yeah, I mean, love them or hate them.  I mean, they're some of the greatest bands of all time. 
[00:33:00]  And they're not even the list.  And where's Quar?  Quar.  Quar.  Quar did not make the list, my friend.  Slipknot.  Norton's a tool.  Slipknot did not make the list, my friend.  Look at Dan from Cleveland.  Who the F is massive attack, and how the hell did they beat Korn?  Thank you.  Let me go to Lou.  Lou, what's going on?  Hey, tell this guy Mike from Washington.  If the game is so good, how come I saw him the other night at the roller rink in Tom's River, New Jersey? 
[00:33:30]  The greatest, one of the greatest bands of all time.  They're playing a goddamn roller rink.  And let me ask you this, what's worse?  Hold on, hold on, I've got to stop you.  Is that a joke, or did that really happen?  That's a joke.  Well, you never know with some of these bands.  Hey, what's worse?  You guys going to get in Washington on Monday, or that list?  Take it easy, guys.  All right, thank you.  There you go.  So where are we?  We're up to number 38.  All right, Bad Brains.  Bad Brains.  Bad Brains beat out the hoe. 
[00:34:00]  Bad Brains.  No sense.  That's one of the greatest bands of all time.  Oh, Vin is so cool, we couldn't even possibly begin to think we are that cool.  And if they wanted some cool bands on here, why didn't they pick Jane's Addiction?  Mm-hmm.  Jane's Addiction didn't make the list.  37th place, Anthony, Blondie.  Blondie.  All right.  You like her or not, pretty influential back in the day. 
[00:34:30]  I'm just looking ahead to 35.  I know, hold on a minute.  What the frickin' that.  Maybe Earl will know.  And if Earl knows, you've got to find a song by these guys.  You find one of these, Earl.  Jesse, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  First of all, is it the greatest bands, or is it the most influential bands?  It's titled The 50 Greatest Bands of All Time.  All right, then that's a bunch of horse poopies.  Yeah.  Is George Clinton on the list?  George Clinton.  And the Parliament Funkadelic. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, yeah, they're up there.  They're up there.  They're way up there.  They're like Kraftwerk.  Like, I don't know.  What number are they on the list?  They're 24th place, my friend.  Because, I mean, like, I mean, you said that you're fans of Crystal Method, right?  Hell, yeah.  They started the whole genre.  I mean, they were the first band.  They were one of the first groups to start tinkering with electronic music.  Right.  And they did do a lot, even though a lot of people haven't heard of them.  And so, I mean, it sounds like video game music.  I mean, if you listen to that stuff, I mean, it's ridiculous. 
[00:35:30]  It's obvious that a lot of these bands on this list are very influential.  I actually bought a Kraftwerk CD, and my friends who don't like electronic music at all,  they put it in so we can turn the volume up all the way and drive down the street  and just look at the looks on people's faces.  And the stuff that they have, this is one of them, it's like,  I'm the operator with my pocket calculator.  And then it's like, I don't know.  It's all tweaked out.  I don't know.  All right.  But is Kraftwerk actually a band, or is it more, you know? 
[00:36:00]  It's a couple of guys with, like, a computer and a drum machine,  and I don't know, they take a lot of acid, and they tinker around with buttons.  If you've got someone playing the computer instead of a lead guitar,  is that really a band?  Well, with electronic music, it's more like mathematical,  but you do need to know some music theory and stuff.  I have a lot of friends that produce electronic music.  All right, Jesse, thanks.  Go blow your nose.  All right.  Fagazi just completely, the Fagazi fans, Opie, 
[00:36:30]  coming out of the frigging woodwork.  They are so passionate and pissed off at us.  Well, you want us to lie?  Tripp, what's up?  Hey, what's happening, fellas?  Hey.  Hey, I think I understand the mentality behind this ridiculous list.  I think it's what's influencing the new metal bands,  like the crappy stuff like Disturbed.  Hey, that's good stuff.  We'd like to Disturbed.  I had to get that shot in there.  But, yeah, you know, young writers, like the guy said before,  and it's, you know, if you look at all the influences, it's newer bands. 
[00:37:00]  Well, then title it the most influential.  Yeah, I think they should have titled it that way.  50 greatest bands.  Do you think, when someone says 50 greatest bands of all time,  right off the bat, I would think The Ho.  Mm-hmm.  And KISS should have been up there, too.  That's the definition of a band.  Well, don't worry about KISS.  All right, thanks, Jamie.  All right, you guys swallow.  Bye.  Bye.  Well, if people want to explain Fugazi to us, Anthony, let's go to Brent.  Brent, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yeah, second time calling, long time listener.  Wank, wank.  That's me.  That's me.  Yeah, Fugazi, I wouldn't say would be in the top 50, but you know what? 
[00:37:30]  Did you ever hear Minor Threat?  No.  You never heard of Minor Threat?  Well, they were, like, early in the 80s.  No, I know the name, but I couldn't tell you what they did.  Well, he came out of, like, Minor Threat, and, you know,  Bad Brains is on his label, they toured with Bad Brains, Rollins Band.  Yeah.  It's like early 80s, D.C. punk.  He started the whole straight edge, like, you know, don't drink, don't smoke.  Here you go, straight edge again.  Don't have sex, all that.  I mean, I don't think they should be in the 50 top, you know, 
[00:38:00]  but they were in the paper today, too.  All right.  Well, thank you, Brent.  Thank you.  That's good.  All right, let's go to Eddie.  Eddie.  What's up, boys?  The theme from Beavis and Butthead is actually Fugazi.  Really?  Getting music when they, you know, open up.  I thought Mike Judge did that.  No.  That's what I always hear.  At the end of the credits, it says Fugazi.  All right.  Hey, did Misfits make the list?  No.  No.  About Suicidal Tendencies?  Nope.  So sorry.  Ah, that list eats.  All right, fine. 
[00:38:30]  See?  People get very upset with these lists, so.  Yeah, this will be out soon.  It's Spin Presents, the 50 Greatest Bands of All Time.  Where are we up to?  We are up to 37 was Blondie, and now we're at 36.  36, David Bowie and the Spiders from Mars.  All right.  A whole glam thing?  I could agree with that.  35.  35.  Do you know this fan, Earl?  A buddy of mine gave me a bunch of this guy CDs like six months ago.  I don't even know how to pronounce it.  It's Fela. 
[00:39:00]  Fela Kuti?  That's all you got to say.  It's Fela.  Fela Kuti and Africa 70, Egypt 80.  What is that, a soccer score?  Fela Kuti.  Wasn't he in Roots?  Fela Kuti.  He's actually, like, one of the first major music stars to die of the Hiv.  Oh, yeah.  So that's why he's on the list, because he's influential with the Hiv.  Actually, it's kind of like, he was really like a precursor to, like, Public Enemy and Rage  Against the Machine.  Oh, yeah?  We got any? 
[00:39:30]  You have some?  I have some at home.  I could bring them in.  Oh, damn.  But it's definitely a little bit more, it's definitely more African-based.  But it's like an African version of James Brown.  So what, they're playing sticks?  No.  What do you mean by African-based?  No horns.  More horns, more percussion.  Can you picture the people that spin in the room going through the list, and the militant  black guy that works there coming up with this?  Dude, man, Fela Kuti.  Africa 70, Egypt 80.  The bands were, I mean, it was literally the number.  What is Africa 70 slash Egypt 80? 
[00:40:00]  It was literally the number of people on the stage.  Oh, my God.  Then Black Kahuru should be on this list.  Good band.  Then they knew how to fill a stage.  And all the whiteys that spin just too scared to tell the guy, no, that sucks.  Right?  Come on.  I'm being honest here.  Because he gets in their face.  Yeah.  So Fela Kuti beats out Pink Floyd on the list.  Yeah.  And they are in a spot instead of Aerosmith, Van Halen, The Doors, Queen, The Police.  Dude, Fela Kuti beats out The Who.  Yeah, they beat The Who.  They beat The Who. 
[00:40:30]  Name one song that Fela Kuti does.  Or Felix Mutti.  Thank you, Earl.  Thank you, Earl.  Earl's the only one that knows of them at all, and he can't name us all.  Would you be playing, uh, would you play Fela Kuti on your Black Coalition show?  Absolutely.  This stuff's great, actually.  Oh, yeah?  Sure.  Uncle John.  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  Hey.  Hey.  You guys, if spin is too cool for the room, call me a friggin' nerd.  I'll tell you, I grew up listening to rock and roll since 1965.  Yeah.  All right?  I grew up with a kid named Frankie Infante, who was a lead guitarist for Blondie. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  All right?  He wouldn't rank Blondie ahead of The Who.  As far as I know, Fagazi is a limousine company.  I mean, come on.  This is ridiculous.  One quick question.  Is Cream on the list?  No.  Of course not.  I guess Clapton's not good enough either.  No.  Clapton, and with all the projects, he had nothing.  Yeah.  I guess he doesn't rate.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  Talk to you.  Bye.  Well, Felakuti, or Fila Kuti.  Sure.  35th place.  And Africa 70, Egypt 80.  The scores are in. 
[00:41:30]  I want to break Snicky's heart right now.  Fish did not make the list.  34th place.  50 greatest bands of all time.  Rage Against the Machine.  Rage.  Sure.  We can see that, right?  Not, you know, eh.  Maybe.  I know a lot of bands came before them that were kind of stirring that style around, but  all right.  Okay.  Felakuti.  Felakuti.  33rd place.  Oh, wait.  Ben's got the Felakuti LPs and 12 inches. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, yeah.  I just...  You can't even pronounce the names of the albums.  The Africa 70 and Egypt 80.  There it is.  Alec Bonklos.  Authority Stealing.  Kalakuta show.  Kalakuta.  Before...  All right.  This is the name of one of their albums.  Holy S.  Can't write material like this.  This is one of Felakuti's LPs.  And Africa 70.  And Egypt 80. 
[00:42:30]  Yes.  Before I jump like monkey, give me banana.  That's the name of one of their albums.  I want that tune right now.  Jesus.  Coughing for a head of state.  Everything's scatter.  I ca...  I ca...  Blindness.  Uh...  Beast of no nation upside down.  Blah, blah, blah.  Before I jump like...  Before I jump like monkey.  Terrific.  Not before I jump like a monkey. 
[00:43:00]  It's before I jump like monkey.  Give me banana.  Waddle doodle.  Bone dry.  One of my favorites on the Greaseman show.  All right.  Sure.  Felakuti.  Felakuti.  Africa 70.  Egypt 80.  Waddle doodle.  Oh, waddle doodle.  Bone dry.  That's funny.  Okay.  33rd place on this list, Anthony.  The Pretenders.  Mm-hmm.  We said 32nd, which would be Kiss.  Kiss.  31st place. 
[00:43:30]  We said it.  Fugazi.  Fugazi.  30th place.  Pavement.  Pavement.  29th place.  Jim Norton would be very pissed off right now.  Black Sabbath.  Black Sabbath is 30th.  Right.  That's a very influential band right there.  Oh, they're 29th, Black Sabbath.  Yeah.  Uh, R.E.M.  28th place.  At least you know the names of these bands.  Yeah.  27th place.  The Grateful Dead, Anthony.  Ah, there you go. 
[00:44:00]  Uh, 50 greatest bands of all time.  26th place.  Pearl Jam.  Pearl Jam.  Pearl Jam.  The Sex Pistols.  At 25.  We said Kraftwerk.  That's 24.  Yo!  Yeah!  One of them's favorite bands from the past, right?  Niggas with Attitudes.  And N.W.A.  N.W.A.  N.W.A.  At 23rd.  Yeah!  Uh, Patty Smith Group at 22nd.  The Smiths.  Ugh.  Awful. 
[00:44:30]  Wait.  21st place.  Uh, the Smiths.  The Smiths.  Right there.  Someone is writing in.  If I hear Limp Bizkit, I'm going to throw myself out the window.  No, Limp Bizkit did not make the list.  All right.  Well, we have to take a break and then we'll do the top 20.  The top 20.  The top 20 greatest bands of all time, according to Sprint Magazine.  Oh, no Rush?  No.  Oh, that's right.  Rush didn't make the list.  Yeah.  Uh, Paul, what's up?  Hey, this is Jesse Camp. 
[00:45:00]  I'm wondering if I'm on the list.  Oh, Jesse, you did not make the list.  That's how much this list sucks.  All right.  Bye.  Later.  This guy has a fila cootie over the phone.  No way does that fila cootie.  We have it right here.  Oh, you found fila cootie?  We got it right here.  Hold on.  That's up on Ant's computer.  On Ant's computer?  Where?  There should be music playing through this.  I don't hear crap.  I got it.  I got it.  You got it over there?  All right.  Hold on.  Let me get to the mic.  Here's some.  I got monkey banana.  You got monkey banana?  Let's hear monkey banana. 
[00:45:30]  That's the before I jump like monkey, give me banana?  It's another one called monkey banana.  That's got to be the same song.  They just got to be.  Uh, Mike.  Yeah.  I got some fila cootie here for you boys.  They don't belong on the list, but they're African.  It's just a lot of horn, a lot of African jumbo mumbo.  Sounds like the Grateful Dead.  Kind of.  But it's all like, this guy got the hip because he had like, I don't know, like seven or eight 
[00:46:00]  wives.  He used to have a professional split roller on stage for them.  What are you doing with this?  What am I doing with it?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I got it.  I work.  I got it.  I like the African funk.  Oh, yeah?  All right.  Thank you.  Ben's got another one for us.  Thank you.  Later, man.  Where do I go with this?  Is it A or B today?  Right there?  Okay.  Go ahead, Eric.  Which one's this?  Monkey banana?  Monkey banana, Anthony.  Undiacere.  You're perfect.  Oh.  This one's this?  Society. 
[00:46:30]  Baby banana, man.  Thank you.  Here we go.  Thanks.  You're welcome.  You're welcome.  You're welcome.  My name was LinkedIn.  You're welcome.  I'm on Twitter.  I'm on Twitter.  You've come on Twitter.  I'm just like, I'm on Twitter.  Oh, man.  You're welcome.  I don't know.  All right. 
[00:47:00]  They incorporate a lot of different sounds into their music.  They get some chuckles out in the hallway.  Smashing Pumpkins did not make the list.  Motorhead did not make the list.  Spinal Tap did not make the list.  There is no racial bigotry here.  I do not look down on niggers, kites, whops, or greasers.  Thank you.  All right, and we'll take a break,  and we'll do the top 20 greatest bands of all time  according to the latest issue of Spin Magazine. 
[00:47:30]  All right.  Let me just hear one more little clip off of Bill Acute.  Okay.  It is never kidding.  Master got me working.  Sunday, Master, take me free.  All right.  No, Alabama man did not make the list.  No, Alabama man did not make the list.  Hey, where's that pinball smashing thing?  I want to play that right now.  When we get back, we'll continue with the list. 
[00:48:00]  Okay, Anthony?  I'm Alabama.  Sure.  I'm a kook magnet, I swear to God.  And one of them works for Ron and Fez,  the show that's on after us here in New York.  He's their producer.  Well, that's what they call him.  Al Dukes is a fag, basically.  The guy is attracted to you.  I don't think I've ever said hi to him officially.  No.  He bought me a present.  A $3,000 classic Rolling Stones pinball machine.  It was just a nice gesture.  Oh, God.  He's got the big Gallagher mallet.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Make him kiss Mick Jagger goodbye. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, my God.  No.  Oh, no.  He's got it.  Smash.  Oh, my God.  Keith Moon lives.  Keith Moon lives.  Oh, no, no.  Look out.  Smash.  A work relationship.  Smash.  I was just making a nice gesture.  Oh.  Smash.  There is a mess out there. 
[00:49:00]  It looks like James Dean's car.  Opie lost his effing mind.  It's gone.  There is one heartbroken little Nancy boy out there.  That's what I think of your kid.  And that's what I think of you.  It seems like every hole in my body is exploding every liquid imaginable.  Opie and Anthony.  Our adult fantasy playroom is open. 
[00:49:30]  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  James Addiction did not make.  Spins list of the 50 greatest fans of all time, man.  Nope.  But Felicuti made it.  Felicuti.  Felicuti.  In Africa 70, Egypt 80.  Yes.  Before we get back to the list, Ed has a bone to pick with us from PA. 
[00:50:00]  Ed, what's up?  Yeah, man.  What's up with the fire company?  You know, just letting the firemen get with these girls, dude.  Oh, the virgin thing?  Yeah, man.  Well, the firemen in this town have had a tough time.  Oh, I completely understand with that.  But, you know, I can do some things myself, too, man.  They can do some happiness.  We have a new little thing we're doing on the show between now and Valentine's Day.  We're looking for virgins to lose their virginity live on the Opie and Anthony show.  We've got the slutty virgin from Cleveland.  She has agreed to fly into New York and allow one of the fine firemen of New York City to help her lose her virginity. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Well, how about a guy with seven fingers?  You have seven fingers?  That's what I got.  Where were you doing our freak show?  You really have seven fingers?  Yes, I do.  We're going to be broadcasting live from Pennsylvania two weeks from Philadelphia two weeks from tomorrow.  Uh-huh.  You've got to stop by the studio so we can check that out.  All right.  All right?  All right, man.  I'm still upset that you're only letting the fire company do this, but, you know. 
[00:51:00]  What do you do for a living?  I move furniture.  Ooh.  So, New York City firemen, have you lost about 500 of your fellow furniture brothers in the last four or five months?  Maybe not the brothers, but the tradesmen on the quality of the furniture.  All right, I don't think that quite makes the cut.  I think everyone else will accept, uh, sure.  Carmen banging the slutty virgin from Cleveland.  Because that's how she wants to lose her virginity, right?  Sacrifice a virgin to the fire department. 
[00:51:30]  We should try to get the slutty virgin on the, uh, the show today.  Yeah.  From Cleveland, okay?  But, uh, we've got to go over the rest of this list.  Uh, Laurie wants to school us on.  Fela Kute.  Hey, you boys.  Hey, slow Nancy out here from New York City.  And I have to tell you, Fela rocks, you guys.  Oh, yeah?  You're going to love him.  He had 30 wives.  His mother was murdered by the government of, I think, Zaire.  Because he was such a revolutionary in politics that he started his own country and wouldn't let anybody in. 
[00:52:00]  It's pretty cool that he started his own country.  God damn that Africa's wild place, man.  Yeah, it's wild, dude.  And his music really does rock.  I mean, you've got to listen to it real loud and it rocks.  But politically, the guy was outrageous.  30 wives.  30 wives.  All of his back-up singers were his wives.  And he gave him the Hiv?  Oh, yeah, I think he gave a whole bunch of them the Hiv.  And he died of the Hiv, right?  Yeah.  Yes, he certainly did.  All right.  Well, thanks, Laurie.  See you later, guys.  We're learning more and more about Felicute, Eazy-E, died of the Hiv, too. 
[00:52:30]  Camille.  He was in NWA.  Yes.  Camille.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey.  You're on the radio, Camille.  No way.  That's great.  I'm so worried.  That's great.  Clank.  Cruising down the street in my sixth floor.  All right.  Spin Doctors did not make the list, though.  Spin presents the 50 greatest bands of all time.  And we said it in 20th place, Metallica. 
[00:53:00]  That's how we started this whole band.  Metallica.  Want to move on with the list, Anthony?  Mm-hmm.  Name this band.  Came in 19th place.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  No, it's not Mata Hooper.  A little laughing.  Staying to the beat of Olivia's dead.  You see me, stay away from me.  Rob Howard's shoulder from a running.  This is 19th.  Yeah. 
[00:53:30]  You alone and you got no idea.  Sometimes it seems to make more sense written on paper than it does when you actually hear it,  doesn't it?  Rob Howard's shoulder from a running.  Diggy, eh?  It's the Stooges.  The Stooges.  Iggy Pop.  Rob Howard's got a missing place.  Nineteenth place of all time, the Stooges.  You know, it was pretty big back then.  Back in the day.  I think it should be on the list.  It's a little high for my liking, but there you go.  All right.  Eighteenth place, Anthony. 
[00:54:00]  Ah, yes.  Tim Brewer's hollering somewhere right now.  I was going to say Tim Brewer.  Eighteenth.  ACDC.  That's good.  I like that they're within the top 25.  Looking at some of the other bands up above them, I think maybe they could have been a  little higher.  A little higher?  Yeah. 
[00:54:30]  Seventeenth place.  Do we have any...  Oh, we do have these guys?  No.  Sonic Youth?  Yeah.  Where's the Sonic?  Sonic Youth.  All right.  Hit that up.  Here's 17.  Sonic Youth.  Sonic Youth.  That's the cocaine.  Nice.  All right.  Seventeenth place, Sonic Youth.  Let's go to Tony.  Tony, what's up?  Oh, what's going on? 
[00:55:00]  Hey, man.  How are you doing?  All right.  Hey, is Megadeth on this list?  Uh, no.  What are you, kidding me?  Hey, I will never pick up another issue with Spin Magazine as long as I live.  Look how angry people get.  People get pissed off when their bands aren't represented.  These lists make people angry.  Korn?  Korn.  Korn made 48th place.  48th place.  They should have made...  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  Oh, thank you, Tony.  Hey, O&A.  Yeah.  Hey, listen.  You guys rock.  You guys should have been number one on this list.  Hey, Das Mute.  Das Mute. 
[00:55:30]  Das Mute.  16th place, Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jimmy.  Jimmy Hendrick.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  I don't know what I'm on.  D.A.F.  I just don't know.  From New York City.  It says, Sonic Youth.  I thought that was the name of Debbie Gibson's first album.  I think that was Electric Youth. 
[00:56:00]  Electric Youth.  Jessica, what's going on?  Hey, I wanted to know if Stevie Ray Vaughan, yes, or Bonnie Raitt made it.  No, no, and no.  How about Nirvana?  Nirvana is way up there, yes.  Stevie Ray Vaughan didn't make it, or yes?  No.  Oh, that's such crap.  All right, thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Look at that anger.  Oh, don't make any helicopter jokes with Stevie Ray.  Oh, wow, dude.  I'm a big Stevie fan from the old days. 
[00:56:30]  Fifteen.  Oh, jeez.  Why'd you have to do that, Earl?  I don't know.  Fifteenth place.  Fifteen greatest bands of all time, according to Spin Magazine, Anthony.  Yeah.  Ah.  Radiohead.  Hmm.  You agree?  Everyone agree on this one?  I do.  Yeah?  All time. 
[00:57:00]  Well, yeah, but I mean, you put Pink Floyd at 49th place.  Help me out a little bit.  Yeah, it's a little.  Yeah.  Flip him.  Flip him.  Radiohead on the list, no problem.  Let's move Pink Floyd up.  You're just like an angel.  Your skin makes me cry.  You're like a feather.  And a beautiful one. 
[00:57:30]  I'm sorry.  I just love that song.  Ah, Bob, what's up?  Yeah, I want to know if Chiliwhack made the list.  Chiliwhack.  Gone, gone, gone.  I've been gone so long, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone.  Remember the video?  There was like a fire in a, in a, like a pail or something.  Great.  In the middle of the woods, I think.  I don't know.  What about Kajagoogoo?  Too shy, shy.  Too shy, shy to not make that.  What about Gino Vanelli?  Gino Vanelli.  No Chiliwhack, huh?  No.  Guess who the Hispanic is on our show. 
[00:58:00]  Hey, he was a valiant.  Gino Vanelli.  Whatever.  Close enough.  All right, Anthony, where are we?  14th place?  Yes.  Yeah, I like this.  Close as you're going to get to Aerosmith.  Yeah.  Old school.  Yeah.  Yeah, boy.  1, B, S, C.  Yeah.  That's the crack pipe over to me. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Boy, this is old school.  Ian, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man. 
[00:59:00]  Second time, Carl.  I've been listening to you guys for a while since you've been here in Cleveland.  Oh, cool.  Thank you.  You said Alice in Chains did not make the list.  No.  Did Pantera make the list?  No.  Oh, no.  Shut up.  No Pantera.  Ben.  Ben.  Oh, shut up, dude.  Ben's yelling at your band choice.  Oh, shut up, dude.  You're crazy.  You're a bunch of homos.  I'm sorry, man.  The Pantera fans will kick your ass.  They will.  You manic attack fag or massive attack damn. 
[00:59:30]  Mike from Yonkers, where the F is quarter flash?  Did STT make the list?  You got a heart in my heart.  All right, Ian.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Peace.  Now, you know, now I'm bummed.  This band should be a hell of a lot higher.  Even though we're up to 13th place, 50 greatest bands of all time.  Of course.  You too.  13th.  I'm looking over the rest of the list. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, I see a spot they could have popped in you too.  I would put them at number two.  Wow.  According to this list, I'd flip those.  All right.  You too.  13th place.  Moving on.  This is 12th place, Anthony.  Yeah.  It's going to be jumping up and down.  Oh, that's some good stuff. 
[01:00:30]  What are you playing this for?  Play it like Stan.  Play something rocking.  Yeah.  This is one of the pussy songs.  Hey, give us one with a little soul, Earl.  Sly and the Family Stone.  Where's Stan?  Dance to the music.  Dance to the music.  I want to take you higher.  No, give me dance to the music.  I like how that starts.  Sly and the Family Stone, 12th place, Anthony.  Yeah. 
[01:01:00]  Woo.  Dance to the music.  This beats you too.  This beats Pink Floyd.  This beats Metallica.  Hey, Sly was a hot band, man.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Dance to the music.  Woo, yeah.  Dance to the music.  These guys must have smoked so much pot.  Dance to the music.  Oh, they like the co-girls? 
[01:01:30]  Dance to the music.  Oh, we need it.  All right, this is a lot of the family still rocked.  12th place, 50 greatest bands, according to Spin Magazine.  And in my opinion, number 11.  Well, this is just because Spin wants to be hip.  I think they're giving much, much credit.  We're Spin.  We got to be hip.  Yep.  11th place.  This whole...  I just never got it.  I never got this.  The Velvet Underground. 
[01:02:00]  Higher on the list than you two.  Lou Reed.  Standing on the corner.  It's a guy that just can't sing.  And he's like the biggest...  I don't know why Lou Reed is so big.  He talks his way through every song.  The guy can't sing.  No, man.  He's not only talking his way, but he's trying to sing.  He can't stay on key.  He doesn't have a voice.  He's not a singer.  All the poets, they studied rules of verse. 
[01:02:30]  And those ladies, they rode their eyes.  What?  CJ!  Oh!  Oh!  CJ!  Oh!  There you go.  Velvet Underground.  Sure.  Wine.  Lou Reed, 11.  All right.  10th place, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  Don't you tell me to sound.  You stink around, I'll make you put your wife.  Yeah.  Beyond what you can tell. 
[01:03:00]  Maybe it's because I'm so versatile.  Sound profile.  I said, hey, no, it's...  Beastie Boys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  From the hunt you never had until the night.  I wrote the memory of all to the ready land.  I was looking back on me.  I'm feeling profile.  People always say my style.  It's wild.  You got a call.  You got a call.  You got to me.  I'm a rap profile.  If you want a better go into now.  Good stuff from the Beastie Boys.  Yeah.  Yeah, Beastie Boys, 10th place, Anthony.  Anthony, we'll move along with this list.  West Coast Dave, a little pissed off so far. 
[01:03:30]  No Blue Oyster Cult.  Blue Oyster Cult.  I got to hang up on a bunch of people because they have nothing really to add to this.  Yeah.  Just in case someone else is trying to get in.  Here we are.  Dixie Midnight Runners did not make the list, okay?  Bad Religion did not make the list.  Moon Juice McQueen.  We already did that joke.  Come on, Aline.  Okay.  And Storker Patty on hold.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we are.  In the top ten there.  Top ten.  Ninth place, Anthony.  This should be a hell of a lot higher. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Rolling Stones.  This should be anywhere in the top three.  Probably two or could even push for one.  But it's number nine.  Please allow me to introduce myself.  I'm a man of wealth and taste.  There you go.  Rolling Stones in ninth place, Anthony.  Huge rock band.  Eighth place. 
[01:04:30]  Unfortunately, we don't have a sample.  I used to love this band growing up.  We have a sample?  Come on.  Are you joking?  Get up.  Get, get, get down.  Nine, my, my.  It's a joke in your town.  Get up.  Get, get, get down.  Nine, my, my.  It's a joke in your town.  We don't have that?  No.  It's about to do the right thing.  Oh, no.  It's one, dude.  Yeah, it's one.  It's one.  Okay.  Eighth place.  W-A-L-O-V-E.  One, oh, eight. 
[01:05:00]  One, oh, eight, F-M.  Yeah.  With Flavor Flames.  Public enemy.  Is he beating his girlfriend?  With the big clock around his neck?  Come here, bitch.  I'm going to get a phone.  I'm going to get a phone.  Listen if you're missing, y'all.  Swing it while I'm singing.  Hey.  Give it what you get.  Number eight. 
[01:05:30]  You know what I'm doing.  While a black man.  Look at his gold teeth, this is.  I'm rolling.  Got to give us what we want.  Uh.  Got to give us what we want.  Oh, hey.  Yeah.  I'm freedom of peace.  There you go.  Public enemy.  Fight the powers that be.  Fight the powers that be.  Fight the powers that be.  Opie, that's us, by the way.  Fight the power.  The white man.  Right, Earl?  Fight the power that be.  That's us, right?  Earl is boogieing.  Will you relax?  I never want to see you dance.  He's dancing.  It was so white.  He was doing that.  He was just doing the push in the air.  The ass out.  And his hands are up in the air. 
[01:06:00]  He's almost doing a raise the roof thing.  Someone get him a big clock that he can wear.  Yeah.  Where the powers that be, though, right?  The white man.  That was awful.  Bring him back the days to my youths.  Youth.  Youth.  Youth.  Youthuses.  Number eight.  Public enemy.  Better than the Rolling Stones.  Of course.  Yeah.  Everyone would agree on that.  There you go.  Seventh place, Ant.  Yeah.  Yeah, these guys are huge, man. 
[01:06:30]  Blow your nose.  Yeah, the Clash in seventh place, Anthony.  Right.  Remember watching all the great Clash videos on the early days of MTV?  Right.  I think it was in rotation every three to four minutes.  Rock the Casbah.  Right.  Fifty Greatest Bands of All Time, according to Spin Magazine.  Sixth place.  Oh, we're going to see our dance again.  Oh, God.  Come on, Bojangles.  Bring them.  God damn it. 
[01:07:00]  All right.  Twisted Sister, Motley Crue, and I Deliver Kegers.  Mr. Bojangles.  Mr. Bojangles.  Okay, Anthony, sixth place.  Yeah.  Woo!  So I can't get around it.  Oh, no.  Look at Al dancing.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Al dancing.  Keep over it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is a chance.  This is a chance. 
[01:07:30]  Parliament.  Yeah.  Pung it down.  Ah!  Parliament Pung it down.  Now we're working straight, son.  I can almost see the big spaceship coming down onto the stage now.  How about a song we recognize?  I've never heard this one.  It's the biggest hit of their career.  Oh, all right.  Earl knows it.  No clue.  I swear.  No clue.  It's one nation under a groove.  It was the biggest hit of their career.  All right.  Well, thank you, Earl.  Okay.  Earl, is that your CD?  Can I borrow it?  Hit the button.  Well, I have it. 
[01:08:00]  All right.  That CD's cool, man.  Can I borrow it?  No, my brother.  You've got to get your own.  Oh, I didn't have it.  Rick, would you get me the goddamn sound on here?  I've got to have it on there.  Son of a bitch.  All right, Anthony.  Perfect opportunity.  Number five.  Yes, number five.  Of course.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Very influential.  Huge, huge fan. 
[01:08:30]  Dervinous.  Nirvana, yes.  Okay.  Fourth place.  Oh, boy.  Where's Falco?  Falco?  Come on, then.  Rock me.  I'm a dance.  Earl, you got a little dance for the next one for us?  No.  Oh, come on.  That's a little high for Bob.  Speaking of high.  That's a little high for Bob Marley and the Wailers. 
[01:09:00]  Look at Stinky.  Smoking his pot.  Ganking.  Fourth place.  50 greatest fans of all time.  Cory Tspin.  Bob Marley.  Yeah, I wouldn't.  You could have switched Bob Marley with U2, maybe.  Put U2 fourth.  Stones.  The Stones.  Someone's asked to be in the top five.  All right, yeah.  The Bob Marley and the Wailers huge to reggae, but come on.  Reggae.  Put him in there, but more?  I believe that was politically correctly motivated. 
[01:09:30]  Tool, Frank Zappa, Flock of Seagull, Slayer, Dylan, Neil Young.  Frank Zappa and the mother.  Bob Marley did not make this list.  All those bands.  But he's not a band.  Huh?  He's not a band.  Zappa and the mother should have friggin' been on here.  Well, Dylan's not a band.  Hey, douchebag.  Bob Marley's, I mean, Bob Dylan's not a band, but Fella Coutte and...  Get 80 guys on stage.  And Kraftwerk and Massive Attack are all bands, right?  I'm not saying that Dylan shouldn't be on the list, but they probably didn't put him on it because he's not... 
[01:10:00]  Not a band.  Not a band.  What do you call him, then?  Solo artist.  A singer-songwriter.  I don't know.  Would he be in the 50 greatest solo artist?  Isn't Bob Marley a solo artist, technically?  He was in a band.  The Whalers were...  So was Bob Dylan.  He had a band, but he was that good that he called it Bob Dylan, you idiot.  I'm arguing with a madman.  I'm a madman.  I don't know.  I might have to go with Earl on this one.  This might have been their logic, is what I'm saying.  Not that it's ridiculous logic, but it could have been it. 
[01:10:30]  Explain why Bob Marley's a band, but Bob Dylan is not.  The Whalers were originally a band.  He just was throwing his boys a bone.  Hey, man, you're my backup.  We're going to call you the Whalers.  Because Bob Dylan didn't have...  Peter Tosh and Bunny Whaler were just two schlubs that he...  Sure.  Back then, why not?  They were originally called the Whalers.  They named it Bob Marley and the Whalers as a marketing tool.  There you go.  Frank Zappa and the Mothers should have been on.  It was Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention. 
[01:11:00]  Right.  That was a band.  You're reaching.  I think you're reaching.  I don't even see Whitesnake on this, and I'm a little upset.  Third place, Anthony?  Third place.  I would have easily made this number one.  No problem.  Motherfucker.  Yeah.  Or something like that.  There you go. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  Led Zeppelin.  Zeppelin always rocks.  Number two, a lot of people would be pissed off, but, you know, no way.  Not number two.  Top ten, maybe top twenty, most likely.  But they come in second place.  Fifty greatest bands of all time.  Now, the Ramone.  Now, I'm not buying that. 
[01:12:00]  I think it's just because Joey's dead.  They're like throwing him a bone.  The Ramone bone.  Now.  Yes, Ben.  If he hadn't died within the last year or whatever it was, that would be not number two.  I agree with you, 100%.  Bruce Springsteen did not make the list.  How many complaints do I have to read that Men Without Hats isn't on the list?  Safety times.  What number's Johnny Bravo?  Well, Johnny Bravo, number one. 
[01:12:30]  And he wasn't in a band officially.  Chris from Philly.  So, there goes your logic, Earl.  Where the F is, but jork.  Jork.  Jork.  Jork.  Jork.  All right.  Finally, Anthony.  Spin presents the 50 greatest bands of all time.  Number one.  Here it is.  No surprise.  We deliver caggers.  We deliver caggers.  We deliver caggers.  Shut up!  There you go. 
[01:13:00]  Number one.  We deliver.  Cute little joke.  All right.  Number one.  Band of all time.  All time.  As far as the 50 greatest bands.  No surprise now.  Yeah, there's no surprise.  Ava.  Yeah.  Ava.  And now,  government number one.  Swedish super group Ava.  This one,  chopping the charts at number one in 1979.  You can dance.  You can dance. 
[01:13:30]  Everything will stop on your mind.  Woo-hoo!  Okay.  Makes me want to go get tickets for Mamma Mia down on Broadway, doesn't it?  Oh, God.  Okay.  Now, so it's time for...  What's number one?  The number one band on the list, Anthony.  Afghan wigs.  What? 
[01:14:00]  I don't...  Oh, you want to read the list?  Oh, you want to beat this bit into the ground?  Okay, sure.  Let me just stall a minute here.  I think Earl's got it.  We're just having trouble finding one.  Yeah, yeah.  One of the...  Yes, of course.  ...songs.  Of course.  From the number one band as...  Oh, no.  Spin Magazine has picked the 50 greatest bands.  And here it is, the number one band.  Yes.  Made famous on that little show called... 
[01:14:30]  Cheers.  Oh, yeah.  Damn thing won't queue up.  Really?  Oh, my God.  Wow.  It's Wang Chung?  Wang Chung.  I didn't know Wang Chung.  Wang Chung beat out Led Zeppelin?  Oh, yeah.  Huh.  Who saw that coming?  All right, obviously.  Not me.  All right, Anthony, please.  Yeah, please.  The build-up.  Go ahead.  Here it is.

You guys are an undisciplined child wielding ultimate power.  And EW.  Hey, Anthony, Sam Adams.  You know, when crazy interns decide to buy us beer, what beer do they choose?  Sam Adams.  Even a lunatic knows Sam Adams is a great beer. 
[01:20:00]  Thank you, kiss-ass.  Thank God he got Sam Adams because, well, we just wouldn't have drank it.  Now I can't help it.  Even out of principle, if we didn't want to drink it, I'd still have to because it's that good.  It's Sam Adams.  We love it.  Pick up the winter lager.  It's the number one selling winter seasonal.

How you doing?  All right.  I'm a CO on Rikers. 
[01:21:00]  Rikers Island.  Yeah.  It's just very interesting that you mentioned Public Enemy is number eight.  Yeah.  Because in my building right now, we've got Flavor Flavor locked up.  What's the Flavin for?  Uh, he got caught with dope again, which violated his probation.  So he'll be with us for a little while.  Is he a big star in Rikers?  Not really.  Everybody pretty much leaves him alone.  Yeah?  The brothers aren't, like, all thrilled to have him there?  Nah.  Public Enemy was back in the day.  Now they're all focused on the gangster stuff.  Ah.  Does he wear the big clock in the joint?  Nah, he's not allowed to have it.  Imagine if he walked around with, like, the striped jail suit and the big clock. 
[01:21:30]  Imagine the other cons.  He walks by and you just go, hey, Flavor Flav, what time is it?  Ah!  You ain't got to a clock.  Yeah, he's a piece of work.  Yeah?  He's been locked up more times in the last couple of years you can shake a stick at.  Does he still got his big gold two-paces?  Yep.  Can we talk to the Flavor Flav?  What?  Oh, no.  I'm not there now.  No?  No, he'd have to call you from there.  Tell him to call us next time you see him.  No problem.  I'll see him tomorrow. 
[01:22:00]  We would love to talk to Flavor Flav.  Yeah.  I'll tell him to give you guys a call when I see him tomorrow.  All right.  Flavor Flav.  Thank you, bro.  All right, boys.  All right.  Bye.  Look who's on the phone, Opie.  Who?  Anna?  Well, we can talk to Anna for a second, I guess.  Hi.  Anna, what's up?  LeBeau on hold.  Who's LeBeau?  Oh, Frenchie from Hogan's Heroes?  Yes.  Anna, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  How you doing?  All right.  What's up?  Get it?  What's up? 
[01:22:30]  How you doing?  What's up?  Anna.  Yeah.  You're on the radio, right?  What's your deal?  So, you called us.  So, what do you want to say?  I want to promote my website.  I just, it's been like four months.  I've been, it's been up for like four months.  Well, what do you do?  It's like me on the internet with like pictures of myself.  What's so special? 
[01:23:00]  Like nude pictures.  What's so special about you?  I can see nude pictures.  Yeah, like dildos.  Hold on, hold on.  Yeah, okay.  So, there's nude pictures of you on this website.  So, what's so special?  There's millions of those out there.  But it's, I'm like with dildos.  I've seen that too.  We've seen all that.  What's so special about your website?  I love playing with myself on it.  It's me playing with myself.  Hey, hey, Anna.  It's me by myself. 
[01:23:30]  Anna.  Yeah.  You can't say any of that, really.  Probably can.  What do you look like?  Just I'm by myself on it.  What do you look like?  I'm a midget on it.  I'm a midget.  I'm 4'6".  Around 4'6".  Are you a real midget?  4'6"?  Yeah.  You got the big butt.  I'm short.  Yeah, I have a big butt.  Like that big protruding butt and the little midget arms and stuff?  Yeah.  You got a big head?  You got squatty body?  Squatty body, yeah.  Where do you live?  A lot of guys love my ass. 
[01:24:00]  Where do you live?  I live in Queens.  Well, come on down and we'll take a look at you and then we'll promote your website.  Yeah, okay.  You got to come down here, though.  All right.  They told me 5 o'clock tomorrow.  You can come down now if you want.  Now?  Yeah.  I can't now.  They told me come tomorrow.  All right.  You can come tomorrow.  But 4'6 is not really midget territory, is it?  It's okay if she's like midget looking.  I'm short.  I am.  I'm really short.  If she's midget looking.  Are we going to get a chance to see that ass? 
[01:24:30]  You know Hank the Angry Dolph?  The dead guy.  I think we've heard of him, sure.  Yeah.  Well, I'm about like his height.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  And I knew him, but he passed away.  Well, there's only so many midgets in the country because you've got to know them all.  What nationality are you?  I'm Italian.  You're Italian?  Yeah.  You sound like an African midget.  No.  Well, come down tomorrow.  I look like Gidget.  You know Gidget the Midget?  I think we might have had her on the show once.  Yeah.  Well, I look like her a little bit.  Well, you all look prettier. 
[01:25:00]  I'm prettier.  4'6 isn't that.  But it's okay if she still looks like a midget.  Like, I wouldn't mind a six-foot-tall midget-looking thing.  Wouldn't that look sick?  You're squatty?  I'm a monster.  Huh?  Anna, you're squatty?  I'm squatty.  Do you have the midget body?  Yeah.  Like the butt that sticks out in the little short midget arms?  We'll decide if you're a midget tomorrow, okay?  Okay.  You could decide tomorrow.  I think it's going to be a waste of time, but come on down tomorrow. 
[01:25:30]  No, I am.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Anna.  All right.  You come down tomorrow, and we'll promote your website.  All right.  All right.  You could check out my website if you don't believe me.  Well, we'll do that tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  Okay.  That way you have an incentive to come down.  That's right.  Okay.  All right, bye.  There goes Anna.  All right.  She's going to be a complete nightmare tomorrow.  I look forward to that.  Great.  We're waiting for the slutty virgin from Cleveland to call us today.  Yes, yes.  She's going to be coming to New York and losing virginity to one of our fine firemen here in New York City. 
[01:26:00]  Mm-hmm.  We're going to have an open call.  Yeah.  And then she'll decide which one she wants.  Open call for firemen.  It's our virginity contest, Ann.  Of course.  Between now and Valentine's Day, we're looking for virgins that want to lose their virginity live on our show.  We'll, and you know, if you're a little shy, it's not like you're going to be in here with microphones and everything.  We'll set it up nice.  I don't want to scare the girls away.  If your dream is to lose your virginity with your boyfriend in a hotel room or something or in a limo, we'll set up any situation you want. 
[01:26:30]  Okay?  All right.  Can we move on to our next guest?  Oh, brother.  Is this another installment of Has Been Corner?  It might turn out to be.  Yeah.  What is this guy pushing?  Remember LeBeau?  LeBeau, the French guy that always made the strudel for Schultz, so he would let him do things.  The gay guy.  Is he gay?  French gay.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:27:00]  No, no.  The French guy from Hogan's Heroes.  What's his real name?  Um, God.  Robert Clay?  Clay?  I don't know.  Well, uh, well, plunk him down so we could, so we could, uh, say hi to him.  Robert?  Hello?  How are you?  I'm fine.  Who are you?  Are you OP or Anthony?  Uh, we're both on the phone right now. 
[01:27:30]  I know, but the one who's talking right now, who is that?  Oh, that's Anthony.  That's Anthony.  Yes.  Lovely name.  How are you?  I'm fine, Anthony.  You know, I, uh, remember, uh, I look back, uh, with such fondness on Hogan's Heroes,  Wow.  And, uh...  I'm trying to remember which one he was.  Oh, that's OP.  That's OP.  Yeah, I'm trying to remember which one you were.  Well, why don't you just look at the book or just watch it tonight, then you'll know who I am.  OP?  Were you, uh, the gay guy on Hogan's Heroes?  Oh, OP, don't give me that dumb thing.  OP, stop it.  Just stop it with gay guy. 
[01:28:00]  There were no gay guys.  I'm sorry, Robert.  Is that your train you gotta do?  That's what OP's like.  I'm sorry, Robert.  Well, don't tell him to shut up.  You know, shut up, OP.  You know something?  I don't think he was as big a fan of Hogan's Heroes as...  Well, it doesn't matter, but he doesn't have to say those dumb things.  No, the guy with the...  Shut up, OP.  Let Anthony talk.  The guy with the, uh, the little...  The beret.  The beret.  The cute little gay hat.  No, it was...  Oh, will you stop me again?  What's your problem, OP?  No, I'm just asking if that was you.  What is your problem, OP?  Tell me.  Was that you?  No, just tell me first. 
[01:28:30]  What is your problem about gay people?  Really, OP?  Oh, you're really gay?  That was...  No, you're really gay because you keep on mentioning it.  Right.  OP?  I just said you were the gay guy at Hogan's Heroes.  OP, be quiet.  Let Anthony talk to me.  I apologize for OP.  I didn't know you were really gay.  I just thought you were the gay looking guy.  Gay is something that was very happy years ago when I was a young kid.  And if you want that kind of interpretation, yes, I'm very happy.  So you're a very happy gay fellow.  Oh, shut up, OP. 
[01:29:00]  OP enough.  Leave, uh, Robert alone.  And he's laughing?  He's laughing at his dumb jokes?  See, he's laughing...  The dumbest jokes I've ever heard is...  Thank you, Robert.  You're going to get with it, kid.  Nobody cares about gay or not gay these days.  Right.  Just shut up, OP.  Robert, are you going to bring in a gingerbread house for us?  Was that OP again?  Yes.  I'm not going to answer it.  Good.  I'm just going to talk to you, Anthony.  If you make sense, I will answer you.  If it don't make sense, just too bad.  No, I understand that.  I apologize for OP again. 
[01:29:30]  And like I said, I was the big fan of Hogan's Heroes and...  Got ourselves a pretty little faggot!  OP.  Enough.  You know what's going to happen.  If he continues like this, I'm just going to hang up.  See?  It's not worthwhile.  No.  That's not why I'm doing this interview.  Of course.  I have written a book that is very dear to me.  See?  I better hang up because I'm not going to have any...  Now you've got Robert cursing.  Don't people like him.  Exactly.  Yeah, Robert, don't curse.  I appreciate the work you've done.  And like I said, you've brought joy to so many people over the years. 
[01:30:00]  I loved...  Oh, you like that, don't you?  Faggot.  Hello?  Oh, Jesus, OP.  Would you stop it?  OP is being a jackass, if I may.  Well, he is a jackass.  He's not being one.  And he is a jackass.  Yes.  There's no doubt about it.  I don't even know what he looks physically, but he is a jackass.  Because nobody will keep on doing those things that he's saying.  I know.  I apologize.  I'm much more polite than you are, OP. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Be quiet and let somebody with intelligence talk to me.  Robert, I...  Thank you.  I made a grave error and I apologize to you.  I was a big fan of Hogan's Heroes.  It was a great show.  It was odd.  But I just want to know a little something about how you were cast in that show.  Now, and your opinion of it, being not many people know...  You're a kid, such a...  OP.  Not many people know that you're Jewish.  Yeah, well, I never hid that I was Jewish. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, yeah.  When I first arrived in America, I never hid that because I'm very proud to be Jewish.  Right.  The Whale got cast in the show.  I was in Los Angeles and my agent went to see the producer, the producer, Ed Feldman,  and was asking who else he needed for the pilot.  And the producer said, see, I need a Frenchman.  And my agent said, Robert Clary is in town because I was living in New York at that time.  Yeah.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  That's exactly who I want.  And I didn't read.  The next day I went to see Ed Feldman.  He said, the part is yours.  Ah, there you go. 
[01:31:30]  How did you feel, though, about being in a sitcom that, you know, had Nazis and swastickers  on the set?  It looks like I'm a wreck.  This is a home.  And the actors, most actors work very little.  They're very few highs, very lots of lows.  Right.  And you accept jobs because you're an actor you're going to accept.  Secondly, even though I was in concentration camps and I was for three years practically  dying through the Nazi-ism.  You were in a concentration camp.  Now, you were captured by the Nazis. 
[01:32:00]  I was arrested by the French policemen, sent to camps in Paris, and then sent to Germany  to, yes, by the Nazis.  And my parents were...  Opie.  Opie.  And you were sent to...  You know something?  I'm going to hang up.  I really cannot stand that kind of thing.  It's not my cup of tea.  I don't like those kind of jokes.  I think it's... 
[01:32:30]  If he makes fun because I was in concentration camp and he makes some laughing tracks, then  Robert, I understand.  I don't need that to plug my book.  I've worked a lot of years to write something that I believe in and truthfully.  And if I'm going to...  Exactly.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  I don't need him.  Exactly.  I don't need him.  That kind of thing I will resent.  I apologize because this...  For some reason, this happens every time we get a guest on the phone.  He's got to be a jackass. 
[01:33:00]  Well, then get rid of him.  I try to...  Let me ask you a question.  You know...  The public who listens to your show likes what he does?  No.  I mean, who does he cater to?  The five-year-old kid?  No!  Ask yourself!  Pretty much, Robert.  It's...  Well, then let me find a kid's show.  Let me be happy with that.  Is that what they call a sophomoric sense of humor that...  It doesn't work for me.  That I don't appreciate personally.  It doesn't work for me.  I have much more class than that.  And I cannot send people like him.  I am not only interested in Hogan's hero stories, but the From the Holocaust to Hogan's Heroes book, 
[01:33:30]  the autobiography of Robert Clary that...  Oh, man.  You are one thing better.  I'm telling you, I'm going to hang up.  You're going to feel sorry.  I really want one more laugh out of you.  See?  And I'm hanging up because I really don't care.  Exactly.  And, well, you shouldn't.  Pussle!  Opie, just shut up.  You've been...  I know they're very, very mean right now.  You've been through quite a bit.  Pussle!  And you've made quite a name for yourself. 
[01:34:00]  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch, and I bet you'd like to soften you.  Yes, Robert.  Yes, Robert.  I'm sorry.  It was very nice talking to you, but I really don't want to...  Hey, hey, stop me, Jess!  Robert.  Robert.  Robert.  Hello?  God, is that awful.  There it is. 
[01:34:30]  Marshall's interview with Robert Clary.  He liked me.  Good DJ, bad DJ.  Why don't you call the publicist and see how that works?  Stop!  Don't even!  God!  And, uh, Rick, I will give you $100 on the spot if you get him back on the phone.  Don't, because I can't take this anymore.  You're in the car.  Wait.  What's the car?  Dude, when you played the can laughs. 
[01:35:00]  And he just stopped at his tracks.  He just...  Worse than playing can laughs after someone says their mother died of a bleeding stomach.  Well, I think we should all...  The guy's telling about how he was captured by the Nazis.  Well, I think we all should go to his restaurant in Brooklyn and make it up to him.  He's got a restaurant?  Oh, that's, uh, the other Frenchie.  Oh, you idiot.  Whew.  Wow.  Well, Rick, uh, is trying to smooth things over. 
[01:35:30]  Smooth things over?  You played laughter over his concentration camp story.  It's no smoothing anything over.  You should have a sense of humor.  He was in...  Sense of humor?  He was in Hogan's Heroes.  What do you think that show was about?  Well, okay.  That's fun-loving Nazis.  That's true.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Okay.  All right.  Uh, Rick's back in the studio. 
[01:36:00]  What happened?  He's online.  Oh.  He wants you to apologize.  Robert?  Yes.  I was, uh, talking with Opie during the, uh, the time, uh, since you hung up, uh, and  now, and I, I'm sorry, and I believe he owes you, uh, an apology.  He owes me to close his mouth and not open it.  Right.  That's what, if he does this, I will continue.  Otherwise, forget it.  I will hang up again.  I, I, I completely understand, right?  I am not a slave.  I am not a moan.  I'm not a kid.  Exactly. 
[01:36:30]  And you can have his jokes with somebody else, not with me.  You know, somebody who's been through as much as you doesn't, uh, shouldn't have to put  up with, uh, juvenile, uh, juvenile, uh, shenanigans.  Looks like you really need to close your book.  The easiest joke in the world is to call everybody a fag.  What is that?  Exactly.  It's, it's, it's terrible for the, for the homosexuals to do what he does.  He's an idiot.  Yeah.  I understand.  And I hope that's on the air.  Now, well, let's, you know something, let's, uh, smooth this over and get back to talking 
[01:37:00]  about you, your book, uh, your career, uh, cause I'd rather, I'd rather, uh, I'd rather  talk about that than dwell on what, uh, an idiot, uh, opie is being.  I hope so.  I hope you, I hope he's not going to say anything because I'm telling you, I will hang up again.  I understand.  What's, what, uh, what other things can we look for on the book?  Cause, uh, not many people know you have a very interesting life.  The book is my life story.  My youth in France, my huge family.  I'm the 14th of the last children of my parents. 
[01:37:30]  Uh, very poor family with a great childhood anyway.  You had a great childhood.  Now, now, wasn't this at the time that the, uh, the war was going on?  Well, I was, I was born in 1926 and a war started in Europe in 1939.  Right.  Which means I was 13 years old when a war started in France.  Yeah.  When the German occupied France in 1940, then in 1941, we Jews had laws.  We had rules.  Right.  We had to wear a yellow star, David.  We had curfews.  We could not do anything.  And suddenly, we, eventually, we got all arrested and sent to concentration camps. 
[01:38:00]  And mostly to, uh, to, uh, gas chambers.  Oh, my God.  So, I, I have, like, a 12, a 13 of my immediate family was deported.  Yeah.  And I'm only one who came back.  I was lucky to survive the three years I spent in concentration camps.  Now, how, how, how, how did you get, uh, how did you escape?  Well, I was young.  I was 16 years old when I was arrested.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Oh, big.  Oh. 
[01:38:30]  Holy Jesus.  All right.  Turn that off.  One second.  One second.  Holy.  Holy.  Holy.  Well, he was stupid enough to call back.  How bad does he need to promote his book?  Hold on.  I can't breathe.  Hold on.  He was the lead singer of, uh, of, uh, Rammstein. 
[01:39:00]  Just before, uh.  Oh, my God.  I, I am more, I, I cannot believe you played, you played, you played, you know, I was expecting  something.  I, we don't even know.  I never expected that.  I don't know what that was.  Holy.  And let's keep it that way.  He thinks he, he knows.  One second. 
[01:39:30]  Uh, look at this instant feedback we're getting.  I'm amazed it took this long for a Frenchman to give up.  He surrendered his phone call.  Jesus Christ.  That was probably, let me just say this.  I said this a lot.  I am going to say it for the record.  That is probably the worst thing you've ever done in the eight years we have been together  on the radio. 
[01:40:00]  That right there, worse than anything.  The dead friend with the old lady telling the kid there's no Santa.  Nothing has been worse than what you just did.  I am stupefied.  What about, uh, the Shirley, though?  Don't even try to come up with something.  Cindy Williams.  It's not even close.  There's not even a close second.  What a, no.  He doesn't have a sense of humor.  He was in Hogan's Heroes.  All right.  You know something?  I'll buy that.  I'll buy that argument.  The guy did.  He went through what he went through, but then he, he went on a situation comedy about 
[01:40:30]  a Nazi, uh, prisoner camp.  But, that's the worst thing you've ever done in this show.  Even worse than Dr. Smith two days ago.  Dude.  Dr. Smith two days ago, nothing compared to what you just did.  Matt from Long Island.  The most uncomfortable radio I have ever heard.  Holy ass funnier than kneecap cancer from Skidmark, New Jersey with a callback.  West Coast Dave disgusted.  You're going to hell.  You really are. 
[01:41:00]  He had still right, uh, after that.  Jim, what's up?  Oh, man.  I gotta go to church just listening to that.  Holy Christ.  You're out of your mind.  Oh, Jesus.  I feel like, well, I don't care if I'm in hell because you guys will be there, but Jesus.  Woo.  That was the best.  All right.  Uh, maybe it's time to make a montage of some of those moments.  You know what I believe Opie thinks is the most horrid part of that whole thing?  He's got to give Rick a hundred bucks.  Yeah.  Oh.  Crap.  You're right. 
[01:41:30]  Wow.  George, how you doing, man?  Good.  That was the funniest thing.  Opie, I think you're the greatest.  I was peeing myself in my car.  That is hilarious.  I wish I was there to push the buttons with you.  All right, bud.  I, I'm reading instant feedback from people that are horrified.  Hitler's speech went beyond anything you've ever done.  Oh, my God.  And that's Tuttle.  That guy's a scumbag. 
[01:42:00]  What?  Wow.  He insulted me.  I need drugs after that.  He insulted you?  Bill, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  I just wanted to say, God bless you.  That was funny stuff.  That's not funny.  Anthony, sorry.  Because tomorrow I'll be you, and you will be me, and you'll be pushing the buttons. 
[01:42:30]  It's still Thursday.  Sorry. </pre>
