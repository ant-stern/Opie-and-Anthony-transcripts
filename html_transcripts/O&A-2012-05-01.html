<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a raucous recounting of Sam Roberts’ experience listening to Troy Kwan having extremely loud sex in a neighboring hotel room during their Cleveland broadcast.  Sam provided graphic details, prompting humorous sound effects and imitations from Opie and Anthony.  This led to a discussion, with Troy Kwan present in studio, about the blurred lines of acceptable behavior between friends, escalating from observation to increasingly intimate participation in the sexual encounter.  Roland, another guest, then joined the show, comically wearing a Brooklyn Nets jersey despite admitting he knew nothing about the team. The conversation briefly touched on E-Rock's prank of tweeting from Opie's account while interviewing a guest named Loki, and concluded with a whimsical discussion about remaking *Pretty Woman* starring Roland and a Cleveland stripper, alongside a critique of the original film’s plot.  Brief sports commentary on the Knicks and Rangers games was also interspersed.

The show continued with a chaotic mix of topics.  A discussion about Troy Kwan's work on promotional materials devolved into sexually explicit banter, including graphic descriptions of masturbation and other sexual acts.  An extensive search for “dress montage” movie clips, specifically from *Pretty Woman*, ensued, veering into discussions about the age-of-consent implications of *Big* and its comparison to *13 Going on 30*.  Amy Schumer, Bear Grylls, and Warren Littlefield were mentioned as upcoming guests. A caller shared a story about a white man using a racial slur during sex with his black girlfriend, sparking a conversation about the N-word and racial dynamics.

Amy Schumer's arrival was marked by discussions of her career, her stand-up show at the Stress Factory, and her negative experiences in Cleveland.  The sexually explicit banter continued, encompassing lesbian sex, and further delved into Amy Schumer’s views on various subjects.  The segment concluded with a lengthy and graphic discussion about bestiality, specifically focusing on videos depicting sexual acts with horses and donkeys, along with reactions from the hosts.  Discussions about Occupy Wall Street and "slacktivism" were interwoven throughout this segment.


The next segment began with a discussion about a Mexican town dubbed "Boys Town," known for readily available drugs and sexual services. A caller’s question about horse insemination led to a detailed explanation of the process by a female caller named Miranda.  This segued into graphic descriptions of donkey shows in Mexico, eliciting varying reactions from the hosts and Amy Schumer.  The conversation abruptly shifted to Occupy Wall Street, with the hosts expressing skepticism about its effectiveness and comparing it unfavorably to "Occupy Cleveland."  The hosts then discussed tasing videos and past show stunts, including shock collars and physical altercations involving a guest named Jimmy.

Amy Schumer discussed her upcoming shows in Las Vegas and New Jersey, recounting her experiences in Vegas, including encounters with seedy casinos and a bizarre elevator proposition.  She detailed a severe case of food poisoning in Phoenix that resulted in hospitalization and hallucinations, prompting a graphic discussion of her symptoms and the hosts’ own experiences with food poisoning. Bear Grylls then joined the show.  The discussion revolved around his departure from *Man vs. Wild*, his new book *Blood, Sweat, and Tears*, and anecdotes from his survival experiences, including broken bones and dealing with extreme weather. He shared a story about having diarrhea while filming and discussed various survival techniques, comparing his show to imitations.  The segment concluded with Grylls discussing extreme weather and insects.


Bear Grylls’ appearance continued into the next segment, focusing on his show "Man, Woman, Wild" and the challenges of getting footage approved.  The hosts joked about his survival techniques, particularly fluid absorption through the bowels, and discussed his new book, "Mud, Sweat, and Beers," comparing his skills to Les Stroud’s.  Grylls shared anecdotes, including using a pink sun hat to diffuse macho posturing from local guides.  The hosts bantered about a potential crossover show with Grylls.  He shared stories about his children, one of whom teaches locals survival skills, earning the nickname "Dr. Livingston." He discussed his aversion to cocktail parties, contrasting it with his storytelling abilities.  Humorous hypothetical scenarios involving Grylls at a McDonald’s drive-thru and his interactions with Prince Charles and the Queen were explored, including an actual account of an encounter with the Queen at a scout award ceremony.

The conversation shifted to fears, specifically insects (mosquitoes and bed bugs), leading to a comparison of the hosts’ and Amy Schumer’s survival skills with Grylls’, culminating in a darkly comedic scenario involving them trapped in a building under attack, and deciding to kill E-Rock first.  Discussions of survival techniques, including starting a fire with a phone battery, were followed by hypotheticals such as zombie attacks and race wars, before returning to Grylls’ preparedness and demeanor.

Warren Littlefield, a television executive, joined the conversation. They discussed his book about the rise and fall of "Must-See TV" on NBC, including anecdotes about *Cheers* and *Seinfeld*, the challenges of launching new shows, and the initial skepticism surrounding *Seinfeld*.  Littlefield detailed behind-the-scenes stories, including nearly canceling *Seinfeld* and Bill Cosby's role in boosting *Cheers’* ratings.  The segment ended with further discussions of Littlefield's career and the changing television landscape.


The final segment focused on Warren Littlefield's career at NBC, particularly his involvement with *Friends* and *Will & Grace*, highlighting the challenges of pitching unconventional shows like *Will & Grace* and the universal appeal of *Friends*. The unrealistic depiction of New York City apartments in *Friends* was also mentioned.  Littlefield discussed other shows, including *West Wing*, and his departure from NBC.  Kenny, a recurring character, humorously interrupted with wildly inappropriate and offensive show ideas ("Welcome Back Clotter," "Malcolm Eggs," "Snot's Amore").  Amy Schumer plugged her upcoming stand-up performances in Las Vegas and New Brunswick.  The hosts repeatedly referred to Amy Schumer as "eye candy" and engaged in suggestive banter with her, further discussing successful and unsuccessful sitcoms and the current state of the sitcom landscape.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  Not enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Good morning.  I'm sitting here thinking, God, we got a lot to talk about. I don't know what to start with.  And then Sam just throws us a nugget a mere 30 seconds ago.  Yeah.  Of course, a lot of people know we went to Cleveland for the live broadcast, and it was a huge success.  Even though there's a few haters out there trying to spin even that.  Shut the fuck up at this point. 
[00:00:30]  The show has passed your by if you're even a fan of the show.  But Sam goes, did you hear me talking about Troy banging his girl?  On the after show?  On the after show?  Yeah, man. She was screaming at the top of her lungs, and I could hear from my room.  So I turned off the TV and just laid in bed and listened.  You just listened to that fucking hell yeah.  But I go to Sam, and I wish he was on the air.  I'm like, that's the shit you bring to our show. 
[00:01:00]  You're still part of this show first, you dummy.  I try to bring a lot to this show, man.  And then, shut up.  And then Sam goes, Sam goes, this is why I don't say things.  And then, because I, there's no good answer.  And then Sam goes, well, we had 100 Cleveland stories.  I don't know.  I'm like, 100 Cleveland stories, that story is better than the 100 Cleveland stories we told.  Yes.  I don't think it's better than Rowling getting jerked off twice.  Well, that was pretty good.  That's up there.  But, I mean, you laying in your bed listening to Troy banging his girl, that's a huge story that you failed to let us know about. 
[00:01:30]  I don't want to honk the mic all the time.  This is your show.  Oh, really?  How many shows do you have?  Yeah, but he couldn't wait for us to, you know, be in our cars on our way home to bring up that Cleveland story.  Yeah, I might have heard a little bit of that.  I heard sounds coming from that room.  It was amazing.  Is Troy here yet?  He better be.  I just saw him strutting down the hall.  Unless he's all tired from fucking or something last night.  This is your main priority, Sam Roberts. 
[00:02:00]  It always is.  No, it's not.  It's certainly not.  It's starting to become where you're saving the best stuff for the after show.  And I'm mad at you, too, Troy Kwan.  Why?  What happened?  Why would you tell us that you're banging your chick?  I thought guys had a strike.  And that she's really loud and that Sam, you know, heard.  Well, he didn't tell me until later until he heard the whole thing.  Well, I had to get his permission.  I wasn't going to go on the air and be like, oh, I heard you fucking.  I was like, hey, is it okay if I go on the air and tell people I heard you fucking?  Right.  Right.  And once I got his permission, we already interviewed Loki and had gotten uncomfortable and we'd moved on from Cleveland. 
[00:02:30]  I was kind of weird about the whole thing.  Yeah, that is pretty fucking weird.  Well, but if your chick is really loud, you've got to assume someone is listening somewhere.  Really loud?  Really loud.  Now, loud is one thing.  Sam, I don't want to put you on the spot here.  And it's not to embarrass you or anything.  But could you imitate it a little bit?  Yeah.  What did it sound like?  Great question.  I mean, that's a great question.  Loud is loud, but there's a certain style, technique, tone. 
[00:03:00]  What did it sound like?  Well, I don't know.  It was like...  Close your eyes.  Get back in that room in Cleveland.  Remember it and give it to us.  It was like...  Actual volume, too.  Right, of course.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It was amazing. 
[00:03:30]  That was what it sounded like.  Was that the pacing, too?  Yeah.  Were you fucking going to tear it back?  Yeah.  And then it would slow down?  Damn.  Troy was doing something like...  Oh, it would slow down a little?  Yeah.  And I'd be like...  Oh, give us the dynamic a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  It would slow down a little bit.  Not the deep voice.  And then...  No one's into the deep voice.  Well, I didn't hear Troy because he knew I was probably listening.  No, I mean, but you were imitating her with the deep voice.  Oh.  You never sound that deep, but now that you're imitating a girl coming, you have to sound like  a...  I don't know.  I don't know.  But she would get down that low, really?  I guess.  I don't know.  I mean, I don't know what girls sound like when they're coming.  All right. 
[00:04:00]  Oh.  No, but then it would get quiet.  Uh-huh.  And be like, oh, they're done.  And then all of a sudden, it's...  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  And I'm like, what is he doing in there?  Wow.  He's doing some of that California long stroke.  Oh, yeah.  It was amazing.  Oh, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  It was amazing.  It sounds it.  I mean...  Wow, Troy. 
[00:04:30]  Jeez.  Yeah, that...  We should have been talking about this yesterday.  Well, he was threatening that he was going to record.  Ah!  I did.  I told him earlier in the day.  But you should have recorded.  And then you go to Troy and go, look, I got something.  Well, I thought...  I'll fucking...  I'll hit delete right now.  I thought...  I just want you to know I do have it in case we want to go down that road.  I was just afraid if I recorded it, it'd be considered classless.  Uh, well...  Well...  I wouldn't lie to that.  Well, I mean, it's kind of classless that you turned off your television and just sat there  and listened to the whole thing.  Troy, you know...  It's creepy.  I don't think there's a human being alive that wouldn't do just what Sam did. 
[00:05:00]  Well, that's kind of true.  I know you're right.  But I would probably not admit to it.  If you hear any kind of fucking noises coming from a room, you're going to listen.  I was watching one of those dating game shows or whatever that's on at like 3 o'clock in  the morning.  Uh-huh.  And I was like, fuck that!  I got new in-room entertainment.  Well, I was excited to see her, so...  Suggesting here that Troy brought the thunder.  Oh, yes he did.  Did he bring the thunder?  I mean, you know, I was wound up from the Hustler Club.  Ah, right, okay.  You know, we had the event earlier, and they had the girls bent over all day. 
[00:05:30]  You know what I'm looking at?  You were all horned up.  Yeah, I'm looking at a lot of asses, and then we were having some fun at the strip club,  and then, you know...  You know what it sounds like when there's a thunderstorm right outside your room, and  you can hear the thunder?  Oh, yeah.  Louder.  That was...  Wow.  It was loud.  Troy's storm was much louder.  Wow.  And we know Troy's down for whatever.  Whatever!  Yeah.  By the way, you're not telling the whole story?  I got spies all over the fucking place.  A dude in Wichita is like saying that you're not telling the whole story.  What am I missing?  That you were laying there deciding if you were going to jerk off or not. 
[00:06:00]  Right.  Wow.  So why don't you add that to the story?  Why do I have to get it from Wichita?  It's timing.  No, you were just about to...  I just hadn't gotten to that detail yet.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Well, because it was asked to me yesterday,  did you jerk off?  And I thought that was a good question.  And I said, no.  Because, you know, Troy's my bro.  But I definitely was like,  well, maybe I will.  Yeah.  And then I was like, no, no, I can't.  And then the sound started again.  I was like, maybe I should...  A little bit.  Now, you had one of these adjoining rooms.  One of the rooms with the door in the middle. 
[00:06:30]  So one...  I mean, Troy's down for whatever.  Whatever.  You should have knocked to see if you're part of whatever.  Well, this is what I told him.  I was like, Troy, once your chick gets here,  you and her do whatever you're going to do,  but just leave the door open.  I'll come in and chill.  You won't even know I'm there.  And it'll be cool.  Right.  And he's like...  Would that be part of whatever, Troy?  Let's start slow.  Like, all of a sudden...  Not whatever.  All of a sudden, you look up  and Sam is peeking, you know, through the door.  And I won't even make a sign.  You won't know I'm there. 
[00:07:00]  And is he going to jerk off and watch?  No, hold on.  We're going slow.  Go slow.  You're in the middle of what you're doing.  Don't make it sexy.  You're all about whatever.  That door that joins the two rooms,  you look up and you see that...  You got Sam's fucking eye poking through, looking.  Just in a little door crack.  Are you still down for whatever?  You're going to continue with what you're doing  or are you going to stop the action?  I mean, technically, I'm on vacation.  Right, you know what I mean?  It's all good.  It's all good.  Sam is my bro.  Right, yeah.  So, I mean, I've had friends watch me fuck before. 
[00:07:30]  So that's all good.  All right, so that's part of whatever.  So now let's say Sam feels a little more comfortable.  Like, oh, all right, he has no problem  with me taking a little peek.  Yeah.  Now he's in the doorway in just his underpants.  Oh, boy.  Oh, Jesus.  Why should I sleep in?  But you could...  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  But now he's just in the doorway with his underpants  and there might be a little action in the front there.  Well, I'm not touching it, but obviously there's some...  You're just observing.  Yeah.  Is that still part of whatever?  I would have to ask her, but she's a trooper.  She's out for whatever you said. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, she'd probably be okay with it.  All right.  I want the real answers, by the way.  Yeah, I'll give you real answers.  Don't do radio shit.  We hate radio shit.  No, she's crazy.  All right, so that's good.  That's part of whatever.  Now Sam goes, oh, this is all right.  Yeah.  So he pulls up a chair.  Right.  And maybe pulls down his underpants and continues to watch it.  But just not touching it.  What?  Just, but not touching it.  No, you're not touching it.  I mean...  Just pinching a little, though.  You're pinching the helmet?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Not stroking.  Yeah.  Is that still part of whatever?  It's starting to go into the weird territory, but, you know, again, 
[00:08:30]  when you're in the moment, you're having a good time, you know?  Right.  Whatever.  Gritting my teeth.  Like, mmm.  Yeah.  The noises and shit would be a little weird.  That's starting to get a little weird.  Like, if you could just sit in the corner, I don't...  I forget you're there.  You won't even know I'm here.  All right.  Yeah.  But his penis is certainly out.  Oh, man.  Definitely.  Am I facing it, or is it behind me?  It's not like you have to look at it, but you just know what's going on.  You looked up and went, oh, okay, he's now moved to the chair.  And he's now jerking off because I'm having sex with my girlfriend. 
[00:09:00]  Right.  I mean, obviously, she...  She's lovely, by the way.  No one would disagree with that, by the way.  She would have to feel comfortable with the situation, you know?  And by that time, we had already had a couple cocktails, so we were...  And she was in the mood, by the way.  I could hear that.  Oh, yeah.  Apparently so.  We came back from the Hustler Club, so we were all...  All right.  So we're still good.  Sam naked in a chair watching you have sex.  Right.  Just chilling.  You know what?  If Sam kind of, like, gets a little brave and starts walking toward the bed.  Oh, shit.  It's all good, dude.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm not cool with that. 
[00:09:30]  Why?  I don't know, man.  Like, yeah, I'm not cool with that.  But whatever.  I thought down for whatever.  Yeah, but think about this, right?  Well, when he said whatever yesterday, I really wanted the true definition of whatever,  and that's what we're getting to today.  See where the line is.  Right.  Did you consider we're in Cleveland?  We're on vacation?  And Troy, you said yourself, if you're not in Cleveland to party, you shouldn't be in Cleveland.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  That's what he said.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  So now Sam's walking over to the bed.  Right.  Yeah.  With a raging heart on.  You're definitely hard. 
[00:10:00]  I'm probably going to have to draw the line there.  Although, I would say, hey.  What if he walks over to the bed with a raging heart on, but he's kind of like a life coach  at this point?  Why?  He's, like, fucking just.  Just kind of rooting me on?  Rooting me on, man.  Maybe he has a towel.  Maybe he's drying me off.  Rooting me on.  Or I just sit down on the bed, like in the corner of the bed.  Oh, how creepy is that?  But he's a life coach.  He's not touching you, but he's saying stuff like, I don't know, you bang that pussy, Troy.  You bang that pussy.  Like, what if I just said, like, yeah, work that box. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, work it.  Yeah, something like that.  But he's not touching you.  He's showing respect to your girl.  He's not going there.  Respect.  He's sitting on the bed naked saying, work that box.  And I'd say this to her.  I'd be like, by the way, you look lovely.  Yeah, yeah.  He would absolutely be complimenting her.  Now you're classy.  I mean, it all really depends on whatever.  Sam is my boy.  So, I mean, you know.  Yeah.  And think about it this way.  It's not like we're bro-ing down.  We're not, like, getting weird.  We're bro-ing down.  You know what I mean?  What's bro-ing down?  It's just like bro-ing down.  It's like whatever, you know? 
[00:11:00]  Whatever.  Yeah, I mean, I've been in situations like that.  Not with my girlfriend, but with other, you know, broads.  So, Sam on the bed now with his raging heart on not touching you, but maybe saying  a few things.  Bro-ing down.  Bro-ing down.  Making some comments.  Yeah, I don't, you know.  Maybe going back and forth with some jokes.  Right.  Jokes.  Yeah, now's not the time to be joking.  Joking matters.  That's cool.  When you bro-down, though, you joke around a little bit.  But would you be up for him and his raging heart on sitting on the bed?  On the bed.  Cheering you on a little bit.  It's starting to get a little weird, but like I said, I mean, it depends on the drinks. 
[00:11:30]  You don't have to look at his heart on, by the way.  No, you don't have to.  You don't have to.  You could.  You could.  You're welcome to.  Yeah, I mean, there would probably be the curiosity of, really?  Like you're sitting here naked with your dick out?  I'd be like, it's cool.  Now what if he leans over just to kind of get a closer look, but how he's leaning over,  he might have one of his hands on your back just because he's trying to get in there.  What?  Just kind of because he's leaning in.  But it's not like a sexy thing.  It's more like a, or like even a pat on the back. 
[00:12:00]  Good job, bro.  It's not even that.  It's like you're leaning on a chair, but it just happens to be Troy's back.  Right.  So you're leaning in and you're kind of supporting yourself a little bit.  To get a better look?  Yeah.  It's more of a balance thing than anything else.  So now you've got Sam's hand on your back, but not in a sexual way, with his raging heart  on as he gets a better look.  It's a balance.  As he compliments your chick and tells you a few things and says that.  And my other hand is touching a little bit of myself.  See that?  We're going from bro to homo territory. 
[00:12:30]  It's not homo.  He's touching your back.  Dude, don't be homo.  He's just supporting himself.  He's supporting himself.  It's all good.  It's all good.  It's all good.  Whatever.  Because he doesn't want to fall into the action.  Right.  So he wants to get a closer look.  And it's just how you guys are set up.  He has to put his hand on your back just to kind of support him.  I mean, I want to get like a really close look.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, as far as dudes go, maybe observing would be cool, but definitely touching is out of  the question.  Other girls would be fine.  No, for balance.  But it's not touching in the gateway.  Do you understand that?  You can balance yourself on the bed.  You don't have to balance yourself on me.  Yeah, but I wouldn't be able to get as close a look.  I'm thrusted. 
[00:13:00]  So you don't want to be balancing off of me.  No, that's true.  If I want to see the thrust.  You might be interfering with the story.  That I don't want to do.  No.  Well, exactly.  So you might want to stay the fuck off with my back.  That machine.  And then what if Sam kind of, I don't know, gets close enough to maybe just whisper in  your ear a little bit.  Just a little bit.  Yeah, again.  Nothing gay.  Just, you know.  Well, what's he saying?  Oh, yeah.  I just feel like, you're doing really well, dude.  Yeah, something like that.  Something like that.  Yeah, something very...  What if I just said this?  Like, I just leaned in and I was like, dude, you're fucking awesome at this. 
[00:13:30]  Holy shit.  It's not, like, weird.  It's just like, you know.  I was starting to get this vibe, like, in Pulp Fiction, where the guy at the pawn store  was, like, watching Zed fuck a...  Right.  Yeah.  Something like that.  What if, like, Sam...  Yeah, fuck.  Yeah, that shit.  Fuck.  Yeah.  What if Sam adjusts himself and his penis touches you, but...  Oh, no.  Touches me?  Yeah, by accident.  As a mistake.  Just for a quick second, and that's it.  That's going to throw me way off. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That's not part of whatever anymore?  No.  See, again, man, like, my whatever, I mean, there's some definite...  Where did the whatever end?  Because now I'm confused.  There's some gray, and then there's some definite black and white.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Out of that scenario, where did the whatever end?  The whatever definitely ended in touching me.  Yeah, yeah.  Everything else you're all right with.  Well, I mean, again, dude, it depends on the mood.  It depends on my chick.  I mean, my chick is fun, and she's...  Can I whisper in your ear without touching you? 
[00:14:30]  And be like, just be like, you're awesome at this.  You're awesome at this.  Or Sam goes, I'm learning a lot from you, Troy.  Right.  But he whispers that in your ear.  Like, if I was just like...  If I was just like...  Man, I'm learning a lot here today.  If I just lean in, I was like, dude, you should teach a fucking class.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Do you like either of these?  So I'm like, I'm getting married soon, and you're teaching me some new moves for the honeymoon.  Yeah, yeah.  But he whispers it in your ear.  What if I leaned in, and I was like, wait till Jess sees that one.  Oh, man.  Just something like that.  Implying that I'm going to fuck Jess? 
[00:15:00]  No, no, no.  Shit.  Implying that I'm going to use your tricks.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah, then we're still in bro territory.  Okay.  Cool.  Cool.  All right.  Cool.  Whatever.  Cool.  And down for whatever.  Whatever.  And down for whatever.  Yeah.  I thought that was all good.  With Sam's raging hard on by mistake.  How about, I bet, I bet I could change the entire dynamic here just by saying that.  Yeah.  Everything we've talked about.  Yeah.  And you're kind of like, something's like, well, it's a gray area, but now he's with  Jess, and they both walked into that door. 
[00:15:30]  Now, does the dynamic change?  Oh, yeah.  It changes everything.  Now you don't care if he's got the hand on your back.  That's like, that's like high-fiving.  Right.  Like, fuck yeah, bro.  Yeah.  Smash that ass.  Okay.  That's, that's all in whatever.  Oh, yeah.  That's.  Now it's, now you're down for whatever.  So I gotta bring a chick with me.  So the problem is he's alone.  Yeah.  That's what makes it a little creepy.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think that Jess wasn't in Cleveland.  Right.  So.  But I'm just saying.  I'm saying if, you know, whatever.  Yeah.  And I come in, and me and Jess are like, I bet you didn't expect this. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, and then you guys start fucking?  Right.  Oh, man.  Right.  Yeah.  The fuck yeah, dude.  Cool.  That sounds great.  Cool.  In the same bed.  High-fiving.  Yeah.  I mean, let me think about this one.  The girls are laughing together.  The beds were pretty big in Cleveland.  Are you wanting to swap?  It depends on the mood.  You know what I mean?  Whatever.  It depends on what's going down.  But what if we're both there, and we're in the same bed, and then our ankles touch?  Is that cool?  Yeah.  That's all right.  All right.  What if our feet cross? 
[00:16:30]  What?  So, like, one foot's on top of the other.  I mean, are we playing footsie with each other?  No, but what if it, I mean, I don't know where it's going.  It's getting so crazy, you know.  It's getting nuts.  Yeah.  If I focus on what's going on, and it throws me off, no, we can't do that.  Okay.  But if it's just like, you know.  You are, you're so sexed up at this point.  Right.  You're not going to notice whose foot is touching who.  Right, right.  Who's dicks in whose ass.  Yeah, no dicks in this ass.  It's all good.  See, we could have done this yesterday, Sam. 
[00:17:00]  See what I'm getting at?  Now we got two days.  You saved this for your fucking after show.  No, because it wasn't nearly as good on the after show, and we got two days of radio out  of it.  Boom.  So did you jerk off?  No.  But I considered it a lot.  Oh.  I think he did.  I think he's not telling me.  I would have told you.  I would have told you.  No, you would.  I don't think he would.  I think he would.  Troy, because I totally called down the creepiness.  Sam's a fag.  I would have jerked off.  I would have jerked off.  Did you need Troy's voice to put it over the top for you?  No.  If she's screaming like that, and you're in the room right next to them, and you're 
[00:17:30]  alone, I'm jerking off.  I don't think so, because...  Are you jerking off?  No.  And here's why.  You don't jerk off as much as I do, I guess.  Because of the Troy quant factor.  Do you jerk off a lot?  That's exactly it.  Yeah, yeah.  But it's the Troy factor.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  See, the Troy factor, it takes me out of the mix.  No, but it sounds like you don't even hear Troy.  It doesn't matter.  Yeah, you don't, but you know he's in there.  I know he's in there.  I wouldn't care, man.  You know if Troy...  How does she sound again?  Let me make sure.  Okay.  And then I'll give you my answer.  And we don't hear Troy, right? 
[00:18:00]  No, I didn't hear Troy at all.  I was silent.  I made sure I kept quiet.  Well, that's good.  But he knew someone from the show was close by.  He knew I was in the other room.  Yeah.  And then she started making all this crazy noise, and I was just like, oh, fuck.  And I didn't want to tell her to quiet down.  Because we've gotten in trouble in my apartment before.  Wow.  What's that?  For what?  Because she screams, and you can just hear it ricocheting off the...  Are you that good, or is she like a screamer?  I don't know.  I mean, you have to ask her.  I don't know.  I mean...  Yeah, he doesn't think she's that good.  Yeah, he does.  He just doesn't want to be the guy to say it. 
[00:18:30]  He said, though, she gets wild in hotel rooms.  Yeah.  She gets loose.  That's her thing.  Well, she just really lets loose.  No neighbors.  It's true.  Trust me.  She's fun, man.  She's a lot of fun.  How'd it sound again?  Give us a good 30 seconds of what you heard there, Seth.  Well, I didn't hear...  She wouldn't go on for a full 30 seconds, because there'd be pauses and...  Why would you pause them?  Well, you just needed to catch your breath there, Troy.  Well, it's all about tension and release.  You build it up, and then you break it down, and you build it right back up.  Slow that shit down for a second.  Yeah, you don't be a powerhouse. 
[00:19:00]  I'm 34 years old, man.  I know how to pace myself.  Not for you.  All right, go ahead, Seth.  What did you do?  Well, it was just like, you know, she's just laying there.  You know, all of a sudden, I heard...  Oh, yeah, I'm jerking off. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, you are.  No problem.  But see, I knew...  Yeah, no problem.  But any time I thought about it, because I was like, oh, I might have to jerk off, just...  But as soon as I thought about it, I was like, wait, but I know very well that Troy  Kwan is the one who's making her make those sounds, and immediately, I'm not... I can't  do it.  Right, that's what the...  No, that's the catch.  I would do it really fast, hoping that I don't hear Troy. 
[00:20:00]  Well, I didn't hear him.  There's no problem at any moment.  You could hear Troy go, oh.  Yeah, I hate dude noises.  That's also worse.  I've had a fucking dude grunt.  But I knew he was there the whole time.  So whether I heard him or not, I knew he was there.  And I...  That does take away.  I didn't even achieve erection.  Oh, wow.  That's right.  That was only half the time, because we started in the shower.  You did?  Yeah.  I would have loved to have heard that.  Because there was a towel rack inside the shower.  Yeah?  So you could use it as a...  Hold on, as a grip. 
[00:20:30]  If I'd heard you in the shower, I would have gone in the bathroom and tried to listen through  the vents.  Really?  Yep.  Oh, yeah.  You have to, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it's still a little creepy, but, you know.  You're cool, all right?  Yeah, whatever.  Very cool.  E-Rock, would you have jerked off?  Yeah, as long as Troy wasn't in there, yeah.  Well.  How did he make the sound?  As long as Troy...  No, the Troy sounds.  As long as I wasn't hearing that, I would have been fine.  Yeah, nice.  No Troy, Troy Kwan sounds.  That's the chance you got to take.  Yeah, I was very conscious of making sure there was no sounds coming from me. 
[00:21:00]  Because you knew that I was going to be listening.  Yeah, and then especially, and then she started, I forgot, like, she really let loose, so...  Yeah, she did.  I heard it.  I was like, yeah, and I thought to myself, oh my God, he's fucking recording this.  You were thinking that while you were banging it?  Yeah, and then the last thing I wanted is you to bring audio on here and be like, ugh.  So while you were banging her, you were thinking about me?  Ooh.  I mean, it crossed my...  Wow.  A little bit.  Well, it just, you recording crossed my mind.  And then I didn't want to tell her to be quiet because...  That's cool, we're bros.  Where's that obnoxious bird noise we used to play? 
[00:21:30]  Oh, man.  So many people are referencing that.  Remember that?  They're saying, uh, Sam, you're a bird.  And also, Sam, uh, like I said, you have the adjoining doors.  Yeah.  Um, were you in any way, shape, or form trying to see if there was any way to look...  No.  ...through the door, underneath it?  I didn't approach the wall, I didn't approach the door.  Why?  I thought that would be too creepy.  Yeah, but they don't know that.  Yeah, but I would have told them.  You're alone with your own thoughts.  They don't know.  Yeah, but I was going to tell them whatever I was going to do. 
[00:22:00]  Like, I was thinking about texting him while the noise is, like, just sending him a text  that just said, you animal, or something like that.  Well, if you're not going to use those noises to jerk off yourself, you should have done  that for the goof.  No, I was like, I just want to listen.  I just want to experience it.  Not to the extent that she is, obviously, but, you know, experience it.  It's still weird.  You think so?  What if some of Sam's pre-comb kind of just dripped on you?  Yeah, no way.  That's throwing me way off.  But I can't control that.  But it's pre-comb, and he can't control it, and he was, like, leaning in to get a look.  I didn't think it was going to come out then. 
[00:22:30]  Maybe some pre-comb kind of flung onto your back a little bit.  A little.  Not like a lot of how that stuff can get around.  Yeah, just a drop or two.  But you feel like it's a raindrop all of a sudden in the middle of your back.  I probably would have just thought it was sweat.  Right, maybe that's sweat.  We'll just keep thinking it's sweat.  It'll be fine, right.  And a lot of people are saying, how does Sam know that it wasn't Troy making the noises?  That they were getting down for some whatever.  Oh.  I mean, it was a real whatever.  I would tell you if there was whatever.  It was a very female-sounding voice. 
[00:23:00]  And I was, because he'd been talking to the stripper at the cherry darts thing, I was definitely listening intently to hear if there was another female voice.  Oh.  But that was just the one.  Okay.  So you were thinking, like, whoa, what's going on in the mirror?  Maybe two chicks.  Yeah.  But no, it was just the one.  Then you'd have been fucking more than happy to knock on the door.  Because it's two chicks.  If it's two chicks, then he's got an extra, you know?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's one of me.  There's one of you.  And you're knocking on that door.  Yeah.  I'd be like, hey, you're not using them both at the same time.  Go ahead, jump in. 
[00:23:30]  Thank you, dude.  You know what you're going to do?  That's bro-ing down.  You really do have to just not say anything.  That bro-ing down thing sounds really gay.  Someone has to say.  Bro-down.  Bro-down kind of sounds gay.  It's not gay.  Well, I mean, look, I've been in bands and we've done all sorts of crazy shit.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, but know why it sounds, because we had a guy that did the book Bro-cabulary and all that.  Bro.  So fucking gay.  The bro is definitely, anything with bro is a little gay.  What kind of gay is?  Just the touch of the gay is in there.  Anything with bro.  I think she was making a lot of noise. 
[00:24:00]  That is a similarity.  That's the horned screamer bird.  One of the most obnoxious birds out there.  That's a bad one.  Yeah.  All right.  I mean, I don't know what Troy was doing in there, but whatever he was doing, she appreciated it. 
[00:24:30]  But, yeah, she liked it.  Yeah, a lot.  I can't tell you how many guys are checking in with hard-ons right now because of this story.  Now it's just like you're hearing me.  Yeah, I'm hearing guys talk about it.  And I was the one making the sound.  That's disgusting.  I mean.  No, that voyeur shit rules.  Yeah, it does.  You hear a female just fucking moaning in another room.  That shit rules.  Yeah, if it had been.  Are you kidding me?  If it had just been a room, it would have been on.  But.  Weep, weep, weep, weep.  That's like my Troy.  It's like I'm not going to get a hard-on.  Now here's what you've got to do. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, sorry.  You just walk in.  Yeah.  And then, like, walk right to the head of the bed where the chick's head is.  Yeah.  And just, like, leave your dick there.  Present.  Like, present and go, hey.  Is that cool?  I'd probably, like, fucking slap your dick out of the way.  Get the fuck out of here.  Whatever.  What happened?  Whatever.  That's not, bro.  God, dude.  That's not, bro.  What's wrong with you?  You're not a team player.  You said you're about whatever.  My version of whatever is with chicks.  Not another dude getting in the mix. 
[00:25:30]  But I wouldn't be touching you.  It's a bro.  It's a bro, first of all.  I remember you guys were bro-ing.  Yeah, that makes it even worse taking the bro-ing to the next level.  That's all.  I wouldn't be touching you.  Yeah, he's not presenting his penis to you.  And I'd be like, what the fuck did you come to Cleveland for then?  Yeah.  Right.  Party time.  The only way that would be acceptable is if Jess was involved.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, man.  He just walks up, presents, her head turns sideways, and just, like, accepts.  What if she just accepted?  Yeah.  What if she accepted before you noticed, and you were like, well, she's down, I guess. 
[00:26:00]  I'm not going to be the nerd.  I mean, if that's really what she wants to do, she can go for it.  Yeah, you don't want to be the square.  Right.  Wow.  I did say I was down for whatever.  I would have tried to find an opening.  I would have opened my window and see if there was a ledge.  Just scale the building?  Yes.  He's hanging outside, risking his life.  I would try to figure out if I could use the hotel mirror and put a stick on it and put it out.  I would try all sorts of shit to get a peek of that.  No, I didn't want to see Troy. 
[00:26:30]  Well, I wouldn't be happy seeing Troy in the action.  I would hope that I could figure the mirror out perfectly.  And also, his girlfriend, I met her, she's a very nice, classy lady.  I don't want to disrespect her by invading her privacy like that.  You know, this is a very good question from Sean and PA.  What if Sam cupped your balls?  If I just cupped the balls?  They were looking a little heavy.  Not the dick.  Yeah, nothing like that.  Just a little cup.  That throws me way off.  Oh, that would.  There's no reason for that.  What if I put a pinky in the asshole, but you thought it was your chick? 
[00:27:00]  Well, I mean, I would see her reaching around.  I would tell that it's not her.  Oh.  So, yeah, that would work.  Well, what if I just did it, then?  I mean, that would be...  I guess Troy's not down for whatever.  Apparently not.  He's not a true rock star.  When we heard whatever yesterday, I was assuming whatever.  But apparently whatever doesn't mean whatever.  I'm down for whatever as long as it's not gay shit.  I mean...  What is it?  Yo, you're bro-ing.  You're having sex with a girl.  Remember, you're bro-ing.  Yeah, I mean, once you're touching me and entering me...  Listen...  It's not...  It turns from bro into homo. 
[00:27:30]  It's not gay.  It's just...  It's all sexual.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, it's just all sexual.  It's all sexual.  That's not my sexuality, dude.  You just gotta get mad about it.  It's hilarious.  As soon as you're entering me...  Yeah, that just takes shit to a whole fucking different level.  It's all just sexual.  It's all sex.  I mean, if she's in the moment, she's like,  Sam, go ahead and stick your finger in my butthole.  I'd be like, whatever.  What if she's saying something?  Oh, shit.  What if she goes, Sam, you know what? 
[00:28:00]  Cup is balls.  What if she's...  Yeah, what if she told me to do something to you?  Now, if she said...  How far would you go if she's saying shit?  Yeah, no.  You're like, that's not...  You'd be like, don't tell him to do that.  No, I'd be like, nah.  I'd work with this guy.  He's not cupping my balls.  Yeah.  Is that the difference?  And then it's like, oh, Troy, come on.  We're here for fun.  I'd be like, stop being a square, dude.  We're in Cleveland.  You guys are like teaming up against me.  Right, right.  Now you got the chick and fucking Sam.  And that's not a position you want to be in with them.  No.  You don't want to be the not cool guy. 
[00:28:30]  And also, remember, there's nothing else to do in Cleveland.  That's true.  That's true.  It is true.  Well, in that case, I mean...  If she's down in the lungs, it just stays in the room.  Whatever.  She's in the room.  Whatever.  You know, it doesn't leave you.  We're there to have a good time.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Yeah.  That's pretty good.  That's a good story that Sam chose not to tell on our show yesterday.  Yeah, thanks.  Thanks, Sam.  I told you guys.  Thanks.  Well, he's a Mike Hogg, so...  We got to hear about E-Rock and Rowland trying to find a place to eat.  That was...  Oh, that story was just as good as this one. 
[00:29:00]  You're right, Sam.  Well, that is funny, though, because they're fat, so...  E-Rock fucking got me bad yesterday.  I kept my Twitter open when they were doing that interview with Loki.  Oh, yeah.  Loki.  Loki, Loki, whatever the fuck.  I don't give a fuck what his name is.  I'll never see that dumb movie.  Ah, you probably will.  It's a big movie.  If they don't give us superheroes, I'm not going to see their movie.  A bunch of other people will.  But I left my Twitter open, and I was very confused, because there was a tweet about his  dreamy eyes, that I was into his dreamy eyes. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, E-Rock was tweeting on your opened account.  Yeah.  He got me good.  Yeah.  Fucker.  I hate when he gets me good.  Maybe that's why he didn't say much.  Yeah, he didn't act like Opie on the air.  He just said...  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he was blowing up my Twitter instead.  All right.  That's good.  We learned a little more about whatever today, Ant.  We learned a little more about whatever entails.  Yeah.  You know, I thought there was no limit to the whatever Cleveland party, as far as Troy Kwan  goes.  But apparently there is some kind of line. 
[00:30:00]  There's some boundaries.  Did you tell your girlfriend that I heard, you guys, and her specifically?  Yeah.  What did she think?  Ah, she's a trooper.  Yeah?  As I told you, she's fun.  She's punk rock.  She doesn't give a fuck.  Good.  She bro down?  She down for whatever or your version of whatever?  Because your version of whatever is kind of square, to be the truth.  Well, she doesn't really want to hook up with dudes, so we're sort of on the same page  with that.  But again, dude, he's a bro. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  She would hook up with a bro.  A bro.  Well, that kind of makes it a little bit...  It would be like me hooking up with one of her friends.  That's cool.  Well, I don't think she'd be cool with that.  I mean, it depends on the friend, of course.  But you'd be cool with it.  Well, yeah, of course you're a guy.  So she'd be cool with hooking up with one of your friends.  Nah, she's different like that.  Oh, God, he's got this shirt already?  He's already got the Brooklyn Nets shirt.  I know.  Bring Roland in here.  Roland is...  Come in here, but I've got to explain really fast.  Not even the logo.  When something happens in New York City, Roland's the first guy to do it. 
[00:31:00]  Like when Linsanity hit, he was the first one with the Jeremy Lin t-shirt.  Hold on, let me set this up.  Yep.  And then Tebow.  Tebow.  Gets signed by the Jets.  Roland is the first with the Tebow Jets jersey.  It was announced officially yesterday, you know, the Nets have officially made their  move to Brooklyn, and it's now the Brooklyn Nets, and Roland has walked in with a Brooklyn  Nets t-shirt.  And Brooklyn Nets pants.  What's up?  Wow.  You don't like basketball.  I'm a huge fan.  Name one Brooklyn Net. 
[00:31:30]  How?  Yeah, you got the shirt and the shorts.  Name one player that plays for the Brooklyn Nets.  They're comfy.  Who's their comfy?  I don't know.  Wow.  What's anything on the back of that?  I don't know.  You don't even know if there's anything on the back of your shirt?  I don't think so.  Yeah?  Okay.  Why are you wearing the shirt and the pants if you don't even know the team?  Um, so I'm going to go to the subway, I go, Bet's Die, whoo! 
[00:32:00]  What?  Why do you need to relate to people on the subway so bad?  So don't get robbed.  Bet's Die, whoo!  It's an ongoing theme with you.  That's it?  Yeah.  I don't want to get robbed, so I just go, yeah.  Brooklyn.  All right.  Oh, by the way, if you heard Troy banging his chick, but you didn't hear Troy, would  you be jerking off?  Eh, probably.  Probably.  But that's not, because Roland had already came twice that night. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, Roland already, fucking.  You think you would have had a third in you if you were next to Troy's room?  I was trying to sleep.  No, she would have woke you up, trust me.  You missed about a half hour of the show.  Yeah, she probably would have woke you up.  She woke up half the hotel, apparently.  Yeah, she did, with her screaming.  Yeah, Roland was tuckered out from the back room at the strip club.  Oh, yeah.  I was tired.  Just fucking flinging his cum everywhere in that strip club.  What a disaster.  You guys are talking, aren't you?  Yeah.  What?  Texting. 
[00:33:00]  Really?  She wants more of your money.  Oh, what?  The strip?  You're texting a stripper.  Don't text.  Are you crazy?  Why did you guys make this mistake?  She doesn't want the money.  She just wants that dick.  That dick?  Yeah.  If you're a guy and you understand the game, then whatever.  Text away.  Have fun.  Yeah.  I learned from Troy Kwan.  I said, she doesn't want you.  I said, have fun.  I said, have fun.  Don't fall in love with the strippers.  That's what you said, yeah.  Yeah, but Roland's a little bit in love.  Oh, man.  Are you in lust?  What are you in?  You're in something.  In debt.  In debt.  Yeah, man.  He had to move out of New York City because he doesn't have a lot of money. 
[00:33:30]  But he's throwing Cleveland strippers fucking cash.  His rent money.  He's like, yo, here you go, bitches.  He wants to go on a strip club rampage now.  Oh, yeah.  What are you fucking texting her?  Like, what do you think?  Hey, how was your day?  I don't know.  Like, whatever.  She goes, how are you?  I go, I don't really care.  That sounds wonderful.  I know.  She's like, so, do you have a bank account?  And shit like that.  What's your check routing number?  Yeah, I just need a routing number. 
[00:34:00]  Just anyone will do.  Was she hot?  Yeah.  Was she one of the ones that played cherry darts?  No.  This was a different one.  What did she look like?  She was tall, dirty blonde hair.  She was really hot.  Yeah, she had a nice body.  Nice body.  You like that, huh?  Who doesn't?  You're going to bring her down to New York so she can ruin your life?  Oh, man.  Destroy Roland.  Can you imagine what a Cleveland stripper can do to Roland in one week in New York City?  Not coming into work.  Roland sleeps in and he wakes up and his entire apartment has been stripped of everything. 
[00:34:30]  Cleaned out.  She's completely robbed.  After all the crystal meth he did.  Yeah.  Or how about she fucking, she's over the house.  She's two having a great time.  You think like, wow, I'm connecting with her and stuff.  And then like, you hear this.  And you're like, well, who is my daughter?  And she's like, oh, it's cool.  It's just a couple of friends of mine want to come by.  You're like, oh, okay.  And then you open the door and it's like, hey, man, what the fuck up?  Yeah, we friends and shit.  And then now they're like, oh.  They're living in your apartment.  Like picking up shit, looking around, casing the joint. 
[00:35:00]  Okay, now.  Why don't you take a walk, motherfucker?  I love my TV too much.  No.  You go, no.  They're fucking in your bed as you just sit there and watch them fuck her well in your  bed using your cotton candy machine.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Enjoying your treats.  Oh.  I'll hug my TV.  No.  All right.  Well, Roland's in here with his new Brooklyn Nets t-shirt and shorts, even though he can't  name a player.  What happened to your Linsani shirt and your Tebow shirt? 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, what happened there?  Tebow stuff will come out soon.  More Tebow.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, what does that mean?  Like that whole, it's almost like a blocks coming down and what does that mean?  I'm not the artist.  I don't know.  Well, why did you buy it?  I think that means miscellaneous font since they just introduced the logo yesterday.  I don't know.  That makes sense.  Or it could be like the buildings or something.  That's the logo that just go with black and white?  Yeah.  Jay-Z said he's going colorless.  Wow.  Oh.  Well, I don't see color either. 
[00:36:00]  Me neither.  Tell you the truth.  Black and white.  That's kind of cool, I guess.  Well, it means something.  But is that the actual logo right there?  Yes, this is the logo.  The font's a little boring.  It really is kind of boring.  I don't like the font.  I kind of like that he went black and white, though.  I don't like the whole thing.  It's very confusing if I look quick.  There's a Bruins thing going on there.  Yeah, I see that.  A little bit.  It sucks.  Yeah.  A little bit, a little bit.  Did you see the jersey that one of the Flyers fans is wearing?  It went viral yesterday, the picture. 
[00:36:30]  It's hilarious.  You know how everyone has a name on the back of their jersey?  Sure.  His jersey says, the black guy or, yeah, the black guy.  What?  Yep.  The black guy?  The black guy.  And what color is the person wearing it?  There it is.  He's there.  He's at the game with his jersey.  It says, the black guy.  That's hilarious.  What the fuck?  People are fucking pissed, though, man.  Because he's white.  Not in Philly.  They're not pissed in Philly, certainly. 
[00:37:00]  Because he's white.  He's a superstar in Philly for wearing that.  They'll probably find out who made it.  But he's supporting the black guy on the Flyers.  That's pretty good.  Yeah.  Isn't that funny?  That's fucking great.  Isn't that great?  What a set of balls on that guy.  Well, not really.  Not if you're in Philly.  That's easy.  Well, you know.  If you're in Philly at a hockey game, that's really easy to do.  The black guy.  Maybe at a Sixers game, it would be a little braver.  Yeah.  But not at a hockey game.  True.  Fuck no.  Yeah, it is.  That's pretty easy to do.  But pretty damn clever. 
[00:37:30]  What a guy.  The Rangers sucked.  That was sad.  Rangers lost to the Capitals 3-2.  And the Knicks got fucking just manhandled again by the Heat.  And the stupid Amari Stoudemire is everywhere today because the dope fucking punched a fire hydrant.  Has the glass.  Yep.  He punched the glass.  Cut his hand open.  Cut his hand open so bad he can't play in game three.  That was real smart.  And possibly they're saying he might be out for the series.  He had to get stitches.  He was so pissed at his performance or the team's performance, he punches a fucking glass. 
[00:38:00]  What an idiot.  The glass panel of a fire extinguisher.  What an idiot.  Knicks are done.  We're not going to even come close to winning without Stoudemire, this dope.  And Carmelo Anthony, that fucking ball hog.  I fucking hate that he's on our team.  And yes, it's my team.  Our team.  Oh, well.  Of course.  It's all of our teams.  That's it for sports, I guess.  That's our sports break. 
[00:38:30]  Roland with his Brooklyn Nets shirt on.  You going to go to the first game there?  What is that, next year?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He'll never even show up.  He won't go to one game.  He'll forget about the Brooklyn Nets after this logo thing passes in a couple weeks.  You really are a bandwagon jumping doofus.  You're the worst.  I am.  Just the worst.  Yeah.  Because this morning people are like, Brooklyn.  I'm like, yeah.  So you do it just to have people have some type of contact. 
[00:39:00]  You don't annoy people.  I feel like you have an ass on the subway.  Like, yeah.  Yeah.  You're not annoying anyone.  They all think you're...  He's not doing it to annoy people.  He's doing it to be in the in crowd.  Right.  Yeah, you want to be in.  You want to be in.  Now, are you ever going to wear your Jeremy Lin shirt again?  Ever?  Probably.  I don't know.  I gave mine away.  Gave it away, huh?  To my brother-in-law.  You probably won't wear that, right?  I might wear it, though.  Now it just seems like...  Yeah. 
[00:39:30]  It kind of seems weird now.  Yeah.  It really does.  Because now you wear it.  People are like, eh.  Yeah.  Oh, that guy.  That flash in the pan.  It's like, they're on sale now at Models.  Are they?  Oh, hell yeah.  Discount?  Beyond discounts.  Like, here, take it.  Did you get them on a discount?  No.  How much was the Brooklyn Nets shirt?  Like, 20 bucks.  20 bucks for that?  That's it?  Yeah.  How much for the paint?  Did you go to Moe's?  Where'd you get it?  Hey, people are suggesting that we remake Pretty Woman with Roland and the Cleveland 
[00:40:00]  stripper.  Oh, and the stripper.  Right?  You want to write the script?  We could do this.  Did Richard Gere get robbed in the movie?  Huh?  Did Richard Gere get robbed in the movie?  I don't know.  I forget that.  That movie was kind of dumb.  That's stupid.  Never saw that stupid movie, to tell you the truth.  I nearly did.  You never saw Pretty Woman?  No.  Come on.  All your years?  All my years.  It comes on once a week on TV.  I just never.  Anything with Richard Gere in it.  How did they get around the fact that she was sucking a lot of dick before she met Richard 
[00:40:30]  Gere?  I forgot.  I don't think they brought it up.  They brought it up.  Really?  Yeah.  She's a hooker.  So she was sucking all sorts of fucking horrible, dirty dick, and then Richard Gere falls in  love with her.  How do they get around that little fucking story?  How do they make it so...  Oh, she just started?  Yeah, that's right.  Is that how they did that?  Yeah.  Her friend was showing her the ropes.  So she had no dick?  Her friend sucked a lot of dick.  She didn't.  How many dicks did she suck before?  Richard Gere was like her first. 
[00:41:00]  That's so stupid fucking Hollywood.  That's such bullshit.  I'm in Hollywood.  But she had at least three before.  Do you think three dicks?  As a hooker, yeah.  Yeah, there's Hollywood for you.  I really would like to know what the fuck the story is there and how they got around  that.  You're right.  Because she was a street walker, too.  Yeah, not even a head story.  The dirtiest kind, man.  She's in the street.  She's getting in the passenger side and just sucking dirty dick in Hollywood.  Not like rolling to just fling and cum at her.  Right?  Just fling and cum.  Right.  But they just kind of avoid that part of the story. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, yeah.  By saying she just...  It was her first day.  That means she was thinking about how much dirty dick she was going to have to  suck, by the way.  Right.  So it's already in her mind.  And then they did the dress montage that now all rom-coms do.  Oh, really?  The what?  The dress montage.  Where he sits down to buy her dress and they flash the dresses.  And she comes out of the dressing room.  Yeah, he just shakes her head.  And he shakes his head.  Oh, not that one.  And then she comes out like, hi, you like this one?  And he's like, mm, I like that one.  And the music's like, ew, I hate that.  I hate the dress montage. 
[00:42:00]  You know, Roland's kind of right.  Gary Marshall did that once in a second.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  And then finally she comes out.  Or she comes out and something goes, uh, and he's like, oh, no.  And then she goes back and like, oh.  She's in a huff.  Oh.  And then finally she comes out and it's like, and he's like, yeah.  And she's like, yeah.  And that's the dress.  And then they pan around.  The workers are like.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's just like, oh.  Is this one of the dress montage songs?  Pretty Woman.  No, I know it's Pretty Woman.  Did they play this during the dress montage?  I'm sure.  This could absolutely be the dress montage. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, I think so, too.  And she's like, this one?  Yeah.  No.  Richard Gere's like shoving a gerbil up his asshole.  He's like, this gerbil?  Ah.  That old gag.  Oh, yeah.  Roy Orbison.  I, uh.  In the movie.  Could you find it?  Yeah.  If you could find the dress montage on YouTube, maybe.  I want to see a dress montage, too.  I definitely want to see a dress montage.  Troy, we're done with you, I think.  Troy Kwan.  I mean, if you want to hang, I don't give a fuck.  Sometimes you guys don't know when to leave, so I just want to give you that option. 
[00:43:00]  That's all.  Thanks, man.  It's Troy.  Did you pound that pussy Kwan?  Did you put together the Cleveland promo that I heard yesterday?  Yeah.  That was good, man.  Are we running it on the channel yet?  Yeah.  Because I don't listen to our channel.  Troy, just fuck.  I've got to get away from this shit when I'm not here.  There he goes.  There he goes.  And I know how to fuck my girl.  I'll fuck her well.  Well, I'll get her really screaming.  And Sam wants to jerk off.  I thought about it. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sam is walking my door.  And he presents his car.  Presents.  Presents.  We've got another movie question coming in after the pretty woman dress montage, if you  can find it.  Oh, boy.  Anything you see.  It is.  It is.  Wait.  Go back.  Go back.  Oh, it is.  Oh, this is terrible.  I'm already caught.  Anything you see here, we can do, by the way.  Get ready to have some fun, okay?  Okay.  Mary Pat. 
[00:44:00]  Mary Kate.  Mary Frances.  She's right there.  She's thinking about sucking that guy's dick.  Yeah.  Goodbye.  Yeah.  Excuse me, sir.  Uh, yeah.  Exactly how obscene an amount of money were you talking about?  Just profane or really offensive?  Oh, yeah.  The doorman from my time.  I like him so much.  Yeah, that guy.  Oh, yeah.  You see the huge phone Richard Gere was just on?  Oh, yeah.  Huge.  Oh, they're all dressing her up.  Here it comes. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, yeah.  How's it going so far?  Pretty well, I think.  I think we need some major sucking up.  You should just be here.  Major what?  You're sucking up.  Not only handsome, but a powerful man.  I can see the second you walked in here, you were someone to reckon with.  Hollister.  Yes, sir.  Not me.  Her.  Her.  I'm sorry, sir.  I'm sorry.  Horrible scene.  Terrible.  How are we doing, ladies?  Oh, Edward.  Edward, where the hell are you?  The Lord's all over this.  Why is Jason in this?  Hang on.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:45:00]  Fucking Gary Marshall said that.  Gary Marshall told you about that.  He pretty much discovered him.  Oh, him with the shaking his head.  No, no.  I don't like that.  I thought they didn't go full dress montage.  No, no.  So, so.  We need another movie with a full dress montage.  Meh, meh, meh.  27 dresses.  Of course you know.  Or the wedding planner.  Well, the wedding planner.  Sam, a lot of people, including Zach in Iowa, I don't feel like going on this phone  call.  He goes, there's no way you didn't jerk off.  I would tell you if I did.  You can't with Troy.  That's Troy's factor. 
[00:45:30]  You're thinking about a person of yours who's not only a co-worker, but somebody you hang  out with.  I'm not hearing Troy.  Yeah, but he's in there.  You know he's in there.  Who gives a fuck?  I'm not hearing him.  I gives a fuck.  That's why you jerk off.  You gives a fuck.  We got another movie question coming in as you find the dress montage.  It's Andrew in New York.  Andrew.  Yo.  Hey.  Knicks fan?  Hey, uh, Knicks fan?  Yeah.  Rodney Park.  Frustrated, right?  Damn.  All right.  What do you got there, brother?  Well, man. 
[00:46:00]  Well, we didn't come.  I don't know where we get away with that.  That 30-something-year-old woman sleep with a 13-year-old kid.  Is that what happened in Big?  Yeah.  Oh, well, he was at the mind of a 13-year-old, but he was in the body of Tom Hanks.  Right.  So it was...  What?  But even after, like, when she drops him off at his house and he gets little, you know,  she still looks at him, like, she's all interested in him, you know?  Nah, she was looking at him like, oh, there he goes back to his innocent little kid life,  and she kind of misses the grown-up one. 
[00:46:30]  But no, that's the real place for him.  Misses the grown-up cock that was on Tom Hanks.  There was a weird thing going on there.  That's a strange movie.  But, uh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  But, I mean, the guy makes a pretty good point, because you can't do the movie the other  way, where it's a little girl, man.  Then there'd be all sorts of outrage.  You can't do it the other way, ever.  So there's a 13-year-old girl.  She gets, uh, she makes a wish that she was big.  Right.  She gets big.  Well, no, that movie was made, wasn't it? 
[00:47:00]  It was called, like, 30, uh...  13 going on 30.  13 going on 30, right?  Yeah.  So she's 30, but she's really a 13-year-old.  Okay.  And does she have any sexual contact in that?  I wonder if she fucks.  What happens?  Does she fuck?  Does she get her fuck on?  Oh, shit.  Is fucking Roland tossing jism?  And, by the way, uh...  Yeah, Budwee.  By the way...  Budwee.  Dumb and Dumber has a dress montage.  I did not know this.  I don't remember a dress montage in Dumb and Dumber. 
[00:47:30]  It's a parody of the Pretty Woman thing.  Oh, it is a parody.  Oh, it's a parody thereof.  A lot of people pissed we didn't play the whole Pretty Woman scene, but it was going on forever.  What do you want from us?  Yeah, yeah.  Do they go full dress montage and we just didn't wait long enough?  I bet they do.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I bet they do.  That was too short to be a real montage.  Yeah.  How is that supposed to influence other dress montages?  Dumb dress montage.  That's stupid.  Oh, God.  Yeah, they're mocking it. 
[00:48:00]  There's also a bathing suit montage from New Guy.  Really?  I don't know.  I don't either.  This shit's coming in.  European Vacation.  Dress montage.  The sweetest thing.  Dress montage.  Yeah, that's the one.  I'm just watching.  I don't fucking...  Whatever.  That movie's got montages.  I'll put the dress montages.  All right, then we can break.  Fuck it.  Yeah.  I gotta eat, yo.  We got Amy Schumer coming in today.  Yes, Amy's in.  She should be here soon.  Bear Grylls stopping by.  He's got a book and he was fired from Discovery. 
[00:48:30]  Roland's making a big deal of him being fired from Discovery, but I think they finally  wanted to move on from Man vs. Wild, I would assume.  Yeah.  Contract disputes.  Apparently, they wanted him to host two shows that are unnamed or whatever.  Right.  He wouldn't do it and blah, blah, blah.  So, oh, man.  He probably should have done it.  I would think so.  I think he should.  Is that Eliza Dushku?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Now they're kind of just mocking the dress montages, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:49:00]  But holy mother of God.  Yeah.  It's a hell of a bathing suit.  Hey, Eliza Dushku is pretty fucking hot.  I don't think I'm going out on a limb saying that.  I was about to tell you that.  I don't think I'm really breaking any ground here.  All right, we're going to break. 
[00:49:30]  And then we've got Warren Littlefield coming in today.  Yes.  Who's his?  NBC exec.  Still there?  Could he do something for us?  No.  Why don't we get these guys after they can't do anything for us anymore?  That's when they write their books.  He's writing a book.  Yeah, he's got a book.  He is not writing a book.  He wrote a book.  Something about a book.  It's all finished.  A book.  Something about a book.  What's his book about?  Seinfeld, probably.  Well, he's a big Friends guy, too.  Friends.  I hated Friends.  Why are we talking to the guy that came up with Friends?  Well, he did Friends and Seinfeld. 
[00:50:00]  Very successful.  I think in Seinfeld, too, when they were doing the pilot episode, they had a takeoff on his  kind of character and everything.  Yeah.  Well, this is going to be a bust.  Franchise.  Franchise interview.  Good Lord, no.  We can only break that out every once in a while.  I know.  In case of emergency.  I thought it went well yesterday, though.  It was great.  It was very uncomfortable.  All right.  We'll talk about some other things.  Yeah.  Oh, Mel Gibson on The Tonight Show.  Pretty good audio.  Stay there.  Okay.  Serious XM. 
[00:50:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, shit.  Putting a little nigga in it.  This is great.  We like when we do that.  We probably should explain to people where that came from.  The N-word?  Amy Schumer, everyone.  That came from my dad. 
[00:51:00]  Yes.  What was it?  We had a couple on the phone.  Was it...  The guy was white, right?  Yeah.  The guy was right.  Oh, right.  Oh, boy.  Oh, shit.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  So fired.  So fired, fired, fired.  Guy was white, married, or long-term girlfriend with a black broad.  Yep.  And explained their sex.  Yeah.  No, wait.  How does it work?  Who said put a little nigga in it?  He did? 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, he did.  To his black girl?  Yeah.  He would tell her to do that.  Oh, yeah.  She would get off on hearing that.  Yeah.  Yeah, so, all right.  I've heard that before.  All right, in the middle of the sex, okay, yeah, he goes, yeah, put a little nigga in  and shit, and it would just get her going.  Oh, yeah.  So every once in a while, we reference that.  That seems like a long way to go to just have the license to say that word.  Yeah, it really is.  I rarely say it.  I say it so much.  Real often.  If you have blue eyes, you just know that you can't say it.  Yeah.  Really?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:52:00]  It's more frowned on.  Yeah, you got to be a little darker.  A little less Aryan.  A little less Aryan, you know, a little less blonde.  Don't burn as much in the sun.  Yeah.  And then you can maybe say it a few more times than I do.  I realize.  I realize I just can't do that.  No.  Yeah.  Oh.  Getting topical.  Hold up.  Wait a minute.  With the sex man.  Oh, that was a getting topical?  Well, yeah.  First of all, I want to ask E-Rock why he rolled his eyes, because I said, could you please stretch the brake a little bit? 
[00:52:30]  Because I have to take a fucking piss.  Why do you roll your eyes?  No.  I was just like, well.  And then Sam goes, he does that every time.  Yeah.  Yes, you do.  I don't even know if you know you're doing it.  Why do you roll your eyes?  Every time there's like extra work that he didn't specifically count on.  No, that's not what it was.  Like he puts his hands up and rolls his eyes.  Like, okay.  Why were you rolling your eyes?  Well, in this case, you were leaving right as the filler was playing before the show was coming back. 
[00:53:00]  Well, Amy came in.  I haven't seen her in a while, so we had a little chit-chat.  We were catching up.  And then I realized.  Is that illegal?  My fucking bladder's full and I've got to take a leak.  Can't do a show with that shit.  And then Amy left and I thought she had a period.  I go, what happened to Amy?  No, I don't get my period anymore.  Ew.  I'm going through menopause.  Oh.  You just looked at me like you really thought maybe I was menopause.  Oh, I don't know.  Yeah, am I aging?  No, no.  The hot flashes.  Yeah.  Things.  You look forward to that as a woman?  Not having it anymore? 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  No, because it also comes with being completely unfuckable.  Right.  I'll take bleeding betwixt the legs once a month for now.  I've already looked at your boobs three times.  Oh, thank you.  Such a guy.  And you're wearing a hoodie.  For Trayvon.  Let's get him out.  Let's get him out, you guys.  For Trayvon, you got him.  No, don't.  No, no, please don't.  It's not for you.  It's because it's hot in here.  It's hot in here.  Awesome.  It's hot flashes.  Oh, my God.  Look at the nice shirt.  All right.  The nice shirt from Urban Outfitters in 82. 
[00:54:00]  That's the thing.  Guys don't care with girls.  You want to have some fashion about you with guys.  You're like, it does not matter.  It doesn't matter.  I mean, look at us, really.  You guys look like shit.  We always look like shit in here.  There's nothing.  You look like a toddler on picture day.  Horrible.  I know.  I'm a disaster.  I look like less shit because of Troy Kwan and called me out on how I came in here every  morning.  And it actually got to me, so I started wearing college shirts.  Wow.  Because he's like the fashion guy.  I used to have just a long...  Is he going with all the tattoos?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:54:30]  I used to wear a long sleeve, just who gives a fucked shirt, no collar, and sweatpants.  And he called me out one day, and now I pick out my clothes every morning because  I'm an idiot.  You're dressing for another man.  I don't know.  I guess so.  You really are.  Let's stay on this for a minute.  No, there was something about it that pissed me off.  I'm like, oh, fuck you.  Yeah.  You showed him.  Well, then also, one of our bosses, actually, he's trying to have a conversation about the  show and stuff, and then he actually looked at me and said, will you pull up your sweat 
[00:55:00]  pants?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  So that was degrading, too.  I was there for that one.  I think it was a combination of a couple things.  That was embarrassing.  Yeah.  I think that makes sense.  It's like...  My pubic hair was actually sticking out.  Oh.  Well, that's...  Over the top of my sweatpants.  Let's incorporate more secrets into the show.  I think if I do radio on the road and I've never been there, and I walk in and some  guys just sweatpants, like, dirty shirt, I definitely am like, oh, he doesn't value  life anymore.  He just gave up.  Yeah, but people know you, guys.  Yeah, they know we gave up.  Yeah, they know it's over.  I didn't realize I was dressing like a slob, but those two things that happened to me, I'm 
[00:55:30]  like, all right, fuck.  I've got a few more years where I should dress nice before I don't give a total care.  When you walk past him in the hall, are you just like, hey, did you notice?  Yeah, how's this, asshole?  Yeah, yeah.  You wear a special shirt.  Well, it was the disgust in his voice.  He's like, oh, God, pull your sweatpants off.  But do you get upset when Troy Kwan doesn't notice that you've dressed up?  That sucks.  This is new.  It's like, hey, Troy.  I ironed.  Sure, you're so quick to criticize, but then when I start wearing nice things for you,  you don't even notice it. 
[00:56:00]  You don't notice.  Well, I think Troy has become the cool guy around here, and I think secretly I don't  like that.  Let's be honest.  He is the guy, though.  I mean, with the hair and everything.  He's a rock star.  He's down for whatever.  He really is.  He is.  He's a suit, suit, right?  He is.  All right, I'm dressing better for a guy.  That's great.  Yeah.  Congrats on that one.  I'm going back to therapy.  A-Rock, why the fucking song?  1992, Rodney King uttered, can't we all get along? 
[00:56:30]  Well, how'd that work out?  Yeah.  Turns out, not happening.  We're not getting along, are we?  We're not getting along.  No.  And that was from Rodney King is beating, you might remember.  You might remember from such things as beating.  You might remember Rodney King from...  What's his resume?  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome...  A sweet beating.  Yeah.  You gentlemen, you might remember from beating and starting riots.  You think there's anything else on his Wikipedia page?  No.  Besides the beating?  Just the beating.  Drunk driving.  It was just the beating. 
[00:57:00]  It was just the beating.  He was born, and then he got a beating.  Yeah, more than just the beating.  Yeah, I was trying to figure it all out.  He...  On the spot, you're right.  It was...  It was...  How long ago did he say?  22.  So it's 20 fucking years, that was?  20-year anniversary today.  Boy, does that make me feel old.  You remember this one, Amy?  I do.  Oh, boy.  My dad pointed at the TV and said, this is what happens when they don't listen.  Oh, my God.  Dad.  It really...  Things haven't really gotten much better, have they? 
[00:57:30]  Nah, they're not either.  Like, there's not this big, like, oh, you watch commercials now, and there's a lot more  black people uncomfortably shoehorned into white situations.  But, I think, other than that, as human beings, we're just not going to get along with each  other.  It's as simple as that.  All you have to do is walk the streets of Manhattan and see how dogs don't get along.  It's like, we're not much different than dogs.  If a dog sees another dog that's not like themselves, they fucking lose their minds.  I like hanging around people that don't mind if I just shove my nose right up their 
[00:58:00]  asshole.  And show some friendship.  That's being friendly.  That is being friendly.  You're a good host.  You didn't say hi to Amy yet.  Yeah.  Hey.  That whole thing that dogs do.  Yeah.  And then...  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Good morning to you guys.  Well, good morning.  Good morning, gentlemen.  With that, we say hi to Amy Schumer.  Hello.  Who's blowing up in front of our eyes.  It's unbelievable.  Oh, don't fucking insult the girl.  I've been doing cardio.  Oh.  Oh.  Okay, okay.  It's different. 
[00:58:30]  You're doing good.  I am?  May 11th through the 13th in Vegas at the Riviera Comedy Club.  Uh-huh.  Vegas.  Yeah.  Why are you laughing at that kid?  Because I love the show, but I open myself by saying, like, the Riviera, this place is  on the cutting edge of closing.  This is fabulous.  But I love the show, and it's really fun, and you can say whatever I want, so.  All right.  Yeah.  And also, is this the first time headlining at the Stress Factory, or no?  No.  Wow.  Awesome.  I have gotten to do Vinnie Brand's Stress Factory before.  Oh, good old Vinnie. 
[00:59:00]  That Vinnie Brand doesn't like women, so you must be doing something well.  Is that true?  I don't know.  Oh, okay.  I just want to be an asshole, too.  I just like it because he puts Vinnie Brand's thing, like, everything.  The toilets say, like, Vinnie Brand's toilets.  Like, seriously.  Have you been there?  It says Vinnie Brand's everything.  Yeah, he's...  He's like Trump.  Oh, yeah.  The Trump of fucking New Brunswick.  He's stamping his name on everything.  Oh, good.  It's all about branding, that Vinnie Brand.  Yeah, he is.  He sure is.  Oof.  Oh, that's cool.  Stress Factory.  Amy said, how is Cleveland? 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  We're still talking about Cleveland.  Oh, man.  My least favorite city in the country.  But this is what I have to say.  But the coolest fucking fans for us.  Okay.  The fans are cool, and the place stinks.  Well, that's where I went wrong.  I don't have fans.  Oh.  But hopefully one day.  No, I really do not care about that.  Our fans would love you.  You should go back to Cleveland.  They would come out and go to see Amy Schumer.  I'm telling you.  You really shouldn't.  I did the improv last time I was there, and it was all black people.  Really?  Which, I love black people.  They have more fun than white people.  We can agree on that. 
[01:00:00]  But they...  Oh, yeah.  Well, how do you class by fun?  It's a lot of being loud.  Yeah, okay.  It was just...  Yeah, I would have liked the heads up on...  They had to have hated you.  Thank you.  Well, just because of the blonde hair again.  Yeah.  And you're a bit too white for them.  And all the racist shit.  Well, yeah, of course.  I know, yeah.  That's the blatant racism and all that.  Yeah.  A hatred of people that are different than her.  You didn't know you were going into a black club?  No.  I got there late, so I walked right into the showroom and right on stage, and not until 
[01:00:30]  I was up there did I look around, and I was like...  And you thought it was an empty room at first?  I was like, why is it just teeth?  No, I was just like...  It looked like the church scene in Coming to America.  Like, everyone was still dressed the same.  Did they laugh at all, or was it so uncomfortable?  They did, but you know, like, black people, a lot of time, they won't be like...  They won't laugh.  They'll be like, you're stupid.  Like, they'll yell mean shit at you, meaning a compliment.  Oh, like they're watching a movie.  Yeah, exactly.  Same reaction when they go to a movie theater.  That's great.  I like black crowds, but I like to know when I'm going to be in front of them. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Because then you can prepare a little differently.  Yeah, I can, like, study up on Ebonics or whatever.  Yeah, whatever you need to do to fit in.  Yeah, holler, yeah, holler, guys.  Holler.  Holler.  Holler.  Put your hands in the air.  Like you just don't even care.  So Cleveland's your worst city?  Yeah, Cleveland's my least favorite city.  Why?  Because I've had a bad time there.  There's nothing to do.  And I think it feels abandoned.  It feels, like, sad.  Yeah.  It's depressing.  My mom, like, I got Cincinnati family, but Cleveland is, you know, I like Columbus. 
[01:01:30]  I like other things.  I don't know how Cleveland just ended up like that.  I don't know.  And I'm over that museum.  But there's still...  Everyone is.  Who gives a shit?  Oh, Sting's jacket.  Fuck you.  Wow.  Oh, I hated the Rock and Roll Museum.  I saw it seven years ago.  Maybe they pumped it up a bit, but it was obviously stuff that these rock stars didn't give a fuck about.  And it was in a box in an attic somewhere that some, like, you know, distant relative had.  Yeah.  Jimi Hendrix, like, progress report from 50. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, just...  Oh, good.  Wow.  Let's find out how he was doing and reading.  Yeah.  Thrilled.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fuck that.  But Cleveland, they keep the city clean like it's about to turn around at any moment.  Right.  They're waiting for, like, the settlers to get there.  Right.  People to get back from war.  But it's just abandoned.  Because it's been six or seven years, and it looked exactly the same.  Yeah.  Didn't it?  Yeah, it did.  There was no difference.  There were no people.  The streets abandoned.  Buildings abandoned.  And it took this one picture.  You would swear it was a movie set, and they had to clear everyone out for the day. 
[01:02:30]  He goes, no, that was three in the afternoon or whatever you said.  Definitely look post-apocalyptic.  It looks like they're experimenting with time travel.  Yeah.  Everyone's just gone.  Yeah.  I feel comfortable saying that, because I was like, I'm never going back to the movie.  You should go back, just for the fan.  Oh, man.  If even five people say they'll come to a show, I'll go back.  I'm telling you, they would come out to see you.  How fast I go back in my words.  Because that's the weird part about it, man.  And they fucked it, and they're great.  They are.  They're great.  Yeah, they're great fans.  You've got to get in front of those white people.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:03:00]  Did you see The Onion yesterday?  No way.  I don't really.  I don't go to The Onion.  I like The Onion.  It's funny.  I just go there every once in a while, but someone told me that, they tweeted me that  they did a whole thing on Cleveland, that NASA is going to send a bus of astronauts to  Cleveland.  Oh, NASA's going to, oh.  That's their next mission.  They're going to send.  To Cleveland.  It was kind of funny.  That's funny.  NASA announced that plans to put man on bus to Cleveland.  That is so funny.  That's good.  Those headlines are the best.  And the timing's perfect. 
[01:03:30]  The timing's perfect, because we just got back from there.  And it's pretty much a lot of the stuff we've been talking about.  Yeah, the way that it's just abandoned.  A whole article on The Onion.  It's terrible.  I like when people think those headlines are real sometimes.  Oh, man.  They tweet them?  Yeah.  Hey, man.  People are outraged.  That just happened to me, though, with an article on some website I'd never heard of.  It had this fake speech that Mitt Romney's wife gave.  Oh, man.  And it was ludicrous.  And I tweeted.  I was like, holy shit, because she was basically like, women shoot me in the kitchen.  I just want my husband not to hit me.  And I was like, oh, this is true.  And then people are like, you dumb bitch. 
[01:04:00]  It's a fake website.  Yeah, before you retweet.  Yeah, you probably should do a little research.  I'm so impulsive with that.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't even think.  I think we all are.  Put some keywords into Google.  See if the whole thing pops up as The Onion.  Well, it wasn't The Onion.  It was some other thing.  Or just some blog.  Yeah, it was just some blog.  It looked so real.  The headline wasn't funny, you know.  I've seen shit like that.  People keep tweeting the picture of Trayvon with his middle fingers up.  It's not him.  That one isn't him.  Is that another Trayvon? 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  It just wasn't him.  There's plenty of other pictures where, you know, he looks a little thuggish.  Right.  But that one in particular, not him.  So people just.  But now it might as well be because it's out there.  Which one?  I want to see if I got tricked by that one.  You probably did.  People asking when's Stress Factory.  I didn't say the dates.  May 17th through the 19th.  You absolutely got to check out Amy Schumer at the Stress Factory.  New England.  It's the one.  Go down.  Oh, well.  Let's see.  No one's above judging somebody based on just like a picture. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  That one.  Right there.  You're on it.  No.  That one.  Right.  That's not him.  Oh.  He's got his both middle fingers up.  And people have put it in a media bias thing where they're showing Zimmerman in a suit.  What kid didn't take a picture like that when they were an angst-ridden teen?  An angst-ridden black teen.  Come on.  We've all been there.  Yeah.  We've all taken a whooping.  That one looks pretty impressive, though.  Yeah.  Which one is him?  That one?  That's him.  Yeah.  Well, that's even scarier.  Well, yeah.  Aw, hell. 
[01:05:30]  Nah, he's fronting a little bit.  You think he's fronting?  A little bit.  I think he's sexy there.  Aw, hell.  Oh, sorry.  Aw, Amy.  Too late?  Oh, boy.  You never went black, right?  Never.  All right.  I thought about it.  It was my New Year's resolution, but it's not.  What, to go black?  Yeah.  It's not panning out?  It's not happening.  You never went black?  Never.  She loves her father.  I do.  I always wanted to go.  I always wanted to go black.  You never went black either?  No.  Well, you should have a theme day in here.  Let's all just go black.  Go black.  I know who will be calling sick. 
[01:06:00]  Calling in sick that day.  Yeah, I'm not feeling too good.  Hey, you want us to stop?  Why isn't Ann here for black day?  Yeah, I don't.  I do want to do kitten day, though.  What's that?  You guys are going to...  We want to fill the studio with a bunch of kittens.  Adorable kittens.  And film our viral kitten video.  That is so...  Because kitten videos are just the biggest thing ever.  Yeah, so...  People love kittens.  And people love kittens.  So we'll get a bunch of fucking props, a bunch of kittens, and we'll just film.  No one's going to trust you guys with kittens.  Oh, look at... 
[01:06:30]  See, Kurt here.  You know Kurt Love?  Bobo's boyfriend?  Yeah.  He's...  He's all mad.  He's got kittens, and they're adorable.  Right, well, can he bring his kittens in for kitten day?  Yeah.  We've got to plan it before they're not kittens anymore, though.  Yeah.  Because kittens have this tendency to turn into cats.  Yeah, see, they've got...  They've got a whole...  Oh, my God.  See, they've got whole montages of kittens.  Oh, look out.  Yeah, look at this, Amy.  Oh, I can't.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[01:07:00]  This one only has two and a half million views.  Two and a half million views.  What do they do wrong?  Yeah, where do they go wrong?  A kitten video is guaranteed $10 million.  Oh, wow.  Look, he's scared.  Maybe it just went up yesterday.  Who doesn't love a good kitten?  It's a shame that one in three of these get feline eggs.  Oh, my God.  You know, it's...  The Internet was made for hardcore pornography and kittens.  And that's it.  That's all people want.  That's it.  So when are we going to make our kitten video? 
[01:07:30]  I don't know.  Well, I'll speak to Kurt.  Yeah.  We'll get some kittens in here.  We need a lot more than Kurt's dumb kittens.  Well, he's got, what, three?  He's got three kittens.  And then he's got a bunch of real little ones that he's got to feed with a bottle.  Yeah.  Apparently, people drop kittens off at his doorstep.  No, he's finding them.  No, these are too young.  They're like little...  They're like freshly born.  Who just drops kittens off at someone's house?  I don't know.  They're a week old.  People who aren't ready to raise them.  One week old.  Not ready.  You can take better care of this kitten than I can. 
[01:08:00]  Kittens are adorable.  Everyone loves a good kitten.  Sure.  Yeah, we'll work that out and get Kitten Day here and make those videos.  I like that you guys went from Black Fucking Day to Kitten Day.  Right, to Kitten Day.  So fast.  You know, we, well, you know, I don't have kittens in the studio.  I understand.  Frankly.  Occupy Wall Street.  Yes, yes, yes.  Amy, they're trying to shut down our city today.  Oh, really? 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, I guess starting at 8 o'clock, the Occupy Wall Street people, who have been invisible  since the weather turned on them last year, they're supposedly going to come out now and  close down the bridges and tunnels and make it impossible for people to get to work.  So they're pissing off the 99%.  Yeah.  Right, the people that are working.  How stupid is this?  Well, they're saying, hey, everyone, you should stay home today.  Anyway, stay home.  Or if you've got to go to work, do a work slowdown.  What is that? 
[01:09:00]  That means you go into work and just do what you do every day.  Every day.  You don't work.  You play solitaire.  No one's going like, all right, I'm going to take down my work a notch today.  Right.  Because you're already at the lowest possible work that you can do and still keep your  job.  Yeah.  That's what everyone does.  See, that's where they lose a lot of people.  Why are you fucking with the 99% commute?  Because they need more publicity is what they need.  That's just pissing off people that might join the movement, you idiots.  But they don't understand something.  It's the cause du jour of yes du jour. 
[01:09:30]  Their cause is done.  It's behind fucking Coney already, which is done.  Behind fucking Trayvon, which is done.  There's all these causes that pop up that people really get dedicated to in 140 characters.  And then it becomes old news.  I thought everyone cared about the Trayvon Martin case.  It's fading.  Well, they did.  It's fading.  Why?  Why?  What happened?  Because that's what happened.  What happened?  It's the hot button.  Really?  It was a hot issue.  Hot issue for a couple of weeks. 
[01:10:00]  That's how it goes.  Natural disasters.  I bet it's like we have 48 hours to make as much money as we're going to.  Right.  Because it will just be over.  Yeah.  There'll be a new tornado.  Move on to something else.  Yeah.  A hot new tornado.  It's Twitter and Facebook causes.  Like people actually feel that they're doing something.  What's the term again?  When they say pray for Japan or something.  And it's like, really?  Why don't you go over there and help?  It says tweeting pray for Japan.  Right.  What does that do in the end?  There's no real activism anymore.  But it's called something.  It's fake activist. 
[01:10:30]  Fuck Travis.  Slacktivist.  It's so true, though, yeah.  Slacktivist.  A slacktivist.  Yeah, there's a term for it now.  And it drives me nuts when I'm on Facebook or Twitter and I see these people.  I'm like, your tweet means nothing.  I'm doing God's work.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, let me just retweet this.  Yeah.  And I'm doing something.  I'm helping the cause.  I've never done anything.  No?  Like, to help any.  Like, I've never.  Have you ever, like, done anything?  I've never done anything.  No.  I've donated some stuff.  I've done some stuff.  Yeah, I've done some donations, but I've never donated.  I've tried to donate my eggs. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, how'd that work out?  Nobody was interested, but I've never, like, I can't imagine, like, picketing or something.  Ugh, no.  I think I've never done anything like that.  Or, uh.  My dad is MS.  I've never even walked for it.  Yeah, I haven't even walked for that, right?  Yeah, I can't have a car.  I know.  You're a jerk.  You're a worthless.  Amy's a jerk.  You're just a jerk.  You're a worthless human being.  Not one MS walker.  No?  I even walked for MS.  I don't know anyone.  Thank you.  I appreciate that.  I was forced to.  It was a radio station thing.  Oh.  But I did walk. 
[01:11:30]  Nothing.  Breast cancer?  Back in the BAB days, we walked for MS.  Nothing.  I'm not walking.  You're just a jerk.  No, I feel like I'd like to.  Yeah.  I'd like to help somebody.  What have you done for MS?  I've never given my time for a cause.  That affects you directly.  I've donated some money.  I know.  I've donated some money.  I've pushed my own dad.  I've cleaned up my own dad's shit.  Oh, there you go.  But no walks.  No walks.  No walks.  What is the walking going to do anyway?  I don't know.  I've donated.  Donating time.  It's like, I could be watching television.  Just look at the NBA telephone.  I have to Google myself.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:12:00]  Who else is going to do that?  I have to Google me.  Get the Google alerts.  I have to see what I'm up to.  Get the Google alerts.  Oh, get the Google alerts?  Okay, maybe.  It makes it so much easier.  Then you have to Google yourself.  Maybe my schedule might free up.  They come to you.  Okay.  But look at the NBA telethon.  What's that?  Exactly.  I don't even know.  All right.  The dumb Jerry Lewis thing.  We all grew up with that shit.  Oh, that's disgusting.  I could honestly say nothing has changed.  No, no.  Nothing's changed and no one cares.  To me, that was a complete waste of time.  People are always going to be retarded.  Yes.  That used to be something that people tuned into. 
[01:12:30]  Because they really believed that we were right around the corner from a real cure.  A cure.  I'm sure things are going now.  I've done a ton of fundraisers.  I did a Parkinson's one last night.  I might have ended Parkinson's last night.  Yeah, but that's just to make your name bigger.  That's true.  I didn't even know what it was for until I got off stage.  I was like, good luck helping the kids, you guys.  They were like, that was for Parkinson's.  I was like, great.  You didn't notice all the shaking that was going on in the audience?  I just thought I was killing.  Didn't you hear a lot of ice cubes in the audience?  I was like, it's freezing in here. 
[01:13:00]  Parkinson's is a motherfucker.  Yeah, that's the worst.  Oh, man.  That's a bad one.  Watch Muhammad Ali.  Just a fucking disaster.  I figure if you have some kind of disease, you could forget about your disease when you're  in dreamland.  With Parkinson's, it keeps you awake all fucking night.  So you can't even escape the shit.  That is so brutal.  Yeah, nightmare.  So Occupy, what are they planning?  They're planning on shutting down.  I don't know how.  Bridges, tunnels.  I don't know how they're planning on doing this because the police really are not going  to take their shit this time.  If they even try to shut down a tunnel or a bridge. 
[01:13:30]  Well, where are we at with this?  How do you get to a tunnel to shut it down?  That's like a terrorist type of thing.  You can't walk down there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where are the people?  We got commuters out there.  Are they noticing anything different?  Yeah, they have to be staging somewhere to shut this down.  It's raining, so they're not out.  Yeah.  Dude, I'm so...  I almost canceled on this.  I can't make it.  I can't make it.  It's raining.  I'd really love to get with the cause and everything.  It's a little nippy.  I'm going to just hang home.  Yeah, yeah.  Hang with the kittens.  Yeah, I got kittens at home. 
[01:14:00]  I got things to do.  Who are these hot ladies?  Some girls visiting.  Oh, okay.  Girls.  Sorry.  Don't ask.  Don't tell.  Don't ask.  Don't tell.  Just guests to New York.  Oh, okay.  Wanted to take in the program.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mind-blowing.  Yeah, they're Amy Schumer fans, though.  Oh, well, can you blame them?  No.  Look at them.  Of course not.  They're very happy you're here.  No, they're not.  They have no idea who they are.  No, they're very happy.  No, they actually don't.  They're like, get this girl a new shirt.  They'll find this girl a new shirt. 
[01:14:30]  And a few people on Twitter say they have girl crushes on you.  Wow.  Okay.  That sounds good.  Is the lesbian community big on Amy Schumer?  Oh, my God.  They have to be.  I think that might just be comedy in general.  Yeah.  But I definitely get a bunch of lesbians at my shows, which I appreciate.  Oh, sure.  I'm into it.  So lesbians are into comedy?  Yeah.  Well, yeah, I guess so.  That scissoring thing is pretty funny.  That's the greatest.  That's the greatest, yeah.  To scissor.  I don't understand how it works.  How do you just mush? 
[01:15:00]  Are you sure that's what happens?  My best friend's a lesbian, and she's tried to explain it to me, and I'm just like, I don't  understand.  Yeah.  It's just mushing.  You just mush your vagina against somebody?  Yeah.  They mush each other's vaginas.  It's like their vaginas are making out.  Like they're kissing.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, they're kissing their vaginas.  I'm going to pass.  You're going to pass on that one?  I'll catch a finger, but I'm not mushing anything.  No mushing?  I bet you I'll be with a girl at some point.  Yeah?  Yeah. 
[01:15:30]  Probably, yeah.  Yeah.  I would like to.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Experience that?  Yeah, but I don't know.  It would seem like you would kind of go that way every so often.  I cannot imagine dealing with a vagina.  Like, I can't imagine.  Oh, really?  Like, I don't want to.  It's kind of complicated.  Yeah, it just seems really overwhelming and risky.  Sometimes you've got to figure out the combination down there.  Yeah, I mean, and I've got the hardware, but I just don't know what I would do with it.  The difference between a guy and a girl when you're talking about an instrument like that  is it's the difference between a kazoo, which anyone can play, and a piano. 
[01:16:00]  That's the guy's penis.  And the fucking vagina is like a harp.  But the penis is no picnic.  It's not.  No, no.  Every different guy has some different fucking insane thing going on.  But all you've got to do is pop it in your mouth, and everything's great.  Okay, well, I've talked about on here about, like, getting, you know, having a surprise  party with a guy being uncircumcised.  Oh, hey, look at that.  Nobody ever tells you that.  And that's just something to navigate. 
[01:16:30]  Turn on or turn off for you?  Off.  Just like, what the fuck?  I'm lazy.  What is that?  I'll take the fast track over anything.  Like, I just had condomless sex with a near stranger recently.  Cool, congratulations.  Thank you.  And he came more than anyone I've ever seen in my life.  Like, it was, I could not believe it was still happening.  And I was thinking, because I had time to think, I was thinking, like, this would be  a compliment to a different girl.  But me, I'm just thinking, my mind goes right to, like, laziness. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't want it to be any more than, like, a little dab of a Kleenex.  I've never felt disappointed by the amount of semen.  Yeah, I was just like, oh, God.  I'm going to have to get up.  Oh, man, yeah.  To shower.  Yeah.  This is horrible.  Everybody's got a different situation with penises.  Yeah, huh?  I dated a guy that, he was a professional athlete for a little bit.  He was, I think he was on steroids.  He had, yeah, I couldn't find his testicles.  Wow, they do shrivel up, huh? 
[01:17:30]  I think they, is atrophy when they go back in your body?  Well, they get really small, I think.  I hear they get small.  Yeah, and then they probably slip up there, yeah.  But I remember.  You really couldn't find his testicles?  No.  And I, like, girl, like, I've never been, like, talking to a friend.  You sure you didn't have some kind of cancer or something?  No, I'm not walking for it.  Do you?  No, I, I, I don't think he, I feel like he would have told me if he had cancer.  How was the rest of his piece?  Fine.  So that was fine with no testicles?  Well, like, I thought it would be fine.  I was like, maybe this is a blessing in disguise.  Girls don't care. 
[01:18:00]  Like, you've never, like, been like, oh, this guy's the sweetest nuts, right?  Like, girls don't give a shit.  But, but I missed them when they were gone.  I was like.  Really?  Yeah.  But it was a very, I wish I could have had an infrared camera when I, like, was first  looking for them.  Golly.  Just what.  You were feeling around for them?  I was like, Helen Keller, like, looking for an apple.  I know they're supposed to be here.  There was just nothing.  And then, you know.  Oh, that's weird.  What's that?  We might have to get Dr. Steve on the phone.  I don't know.  And so, now you obviously have the parts, but you think that it would be a daunting task 
[01:18:30]  to try to navigate the vagina?  I think I'd be grossed out.  Really?  Yeah.  Where would you start with the vagina?  Let's, let's, let's slow it down a little bit.  I think I, I think I would go.  Can we turn down the lights a little bit, please?  Oh, this is going to be so disappointing.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's going to be real clinical.  Where would you start, Amy?  I would start and finish only dealing with the clit.  Yeah.  And, yeah, I'd probably keep it, keep it on the outskirts.  All above board.  All outskirts.  You wouldn't, yeah.  You wouldn't finger pop or anything?  You wouldn't delve into the moist canyon. 
[01:19:00]  I don't know why, but that really makes me sick.  Wow.  Wow.  Then I doubt you will be with a woman then at some point.  But my friend Jackie.  You want to be with a woman just kissing and feeling boobies.  My BFF, Jackie, who's with me at the Riviera every month.  May 11th through the 13th.  Yes.  She's gay.  And she told me about these things called stone lesbians or stone dykes who only want  to pleasure you and they don't want you to do anything to them.  Whoa.  Sign me up.  That sounds awesome.  Can you please try that out?  And come back with a full report? 
[01:19:30]  Wow.  I have no problem.  What is the fine one right now?  Yeah.  A stone dyke?  I'm single.  Let's do this now.  You know what?  We've usually heard about a lot of the stuff you guys talk about.  Have you heard of a stone dyke?  Never.  Never.  I had never either.  There's a whole like...  Stone dyke lesbians.  Lesbians are like magicians with like they don't want to give their tricks away, I think.  Yeah.  Jackie felt bad about even telling me that.  Wow.  What is a stone butch?  Stone butch.  Stone butch.  That's what it is.  Okay.  That's the official term.  Stone butch. 
[01:20:00]  What is a stone butch, Sam?  Amy is hot as balls.  That just came in.  Rob in Pennsylvania.  Hot as balls.  Robin?  Rob.  Oh, Rob.  Rob.  Come on.  We're looking for...  And very funny, by the way.  Oh, thank you.  That's a rare combination.  Where's the chick?  I guess butch is described as the gender in stone meaning very.  So very butch.  I don't know what this woman is talking about.  Maybe go to a different one.  Yeah, that's...  How about some people calling with this shit? 
[01:20:30]  I'm on Wikipedia.  Yeah, man.  A stone butch is a woman who is strongly masculine in character and dress, who tops her partner  sexually, and who does not wish to be touched genitally.  Boom.  Hook me up.  Hook me up.  I could do that.  I'll touch a boob.  I'll put a boob in my mouth.  But you're okay with them looking like manly women?  Yeah.  I don't know who I wouldn't let go down on me. 
[01:21:00]  I would like to see...  Think about it.  Do you have one?  Some animals.  I would, you know...  Really?  Some.  Some.  But some.  I like that she's...  A little kitten, right?  You would go dog, right?  Oh, God.  No.  I've seen those horrid videos.  Yes, of course.  A pit bull?  Is it something masculine?  Yeah, I'm not saying you're a degenerate.  I'm just saying for the story...  For the story, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, okay.  Some of those videos are...  Because it's hilarious.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'd let a shih tzu go down on me.  I've watched some of those dog and women videos. 
[01:21:30]  And I always...  The first thing I think of is like, how did it get to that?  Yeah.  Like, how does it...  I can't just be like, yeah, look at that dog, fucking her.  I just think like, oh, why is she doing that?  The progression.  The choices.  Like the first time she sucked a dog's dick.  She had to be thinking like, I'm sucking a dog dick.  Right, yeah.  Because you know she had nice little, you know, birthday parties.  Oh, there's pictures of her, like what a party had.  Everyone starts with at least one or two.  Blowing the candles out.  She did also have birthday parties growing up.  Yeah, well, that's... 
[01:22:00]  No way.  No, I think you start with a few.  You have to have a couple, maybe.  I think everyone gets a couple.  I don't think so.  If you're sucking dog dick, you think no birthday parties ever.  I think that means zero birthday parties.  Wow, could be.  Your teacher maybe, like, gave you a cupcake.  Yeah.  A latchkey kid.  And more.  Out of sadness.  Yeah.  Out of sadness.  She brought one cupcake to school knowing there's no birthday cake at home.  Yeah, and even then she knew one day I'm going to suck a Cocker Spaniel's dick.  Suck a dog dick.  And what does the dick represent?  The candle she never got to blow out.  Oh, my God.  This is so sad.  Yeah.  And then there's the pony and horse ones. 
[01:22:30]  I've seen a few of those.  Have you seen them live?  Huh?  Live?  Have you ever seen, like, a donkey show?  No.  You have, Amy?  No.  No.  No.  Oh, do they really exist?  Yeah, huh?  Yeah, they do exist.  They do exist?  They exist, yeah.  In Mexico.  Wow.  Those videos, I look at the girl and I go, she can't possibly be enjoying that.  No, no.  No.  I think about what it has to smell like.  I know.  She's just really taking on a horse's dick.  And she's trying to act like it's the hottest thing ever.  It could be some fetish, maybe. 
[01:23:00]  And they're always looking off camera because you know there's a guy with, like, an AK-47.  Oh, yeah.  He's just threatening to fucking blow her head off if she even makes a false move.  That's why they're looking off camera.  That is so odd.  Looking for approval, like, are we almost done and am I doing this right?  And then the silent victim.  Can I get my drugs now, please?  Who is it?  The silent victim?  The horse.  The horse.  The horse is in a relationship.  He's like, I don't want to be doing this.  Oh, then I noticed the horse is just eating.  He has no idea what the fuck's going on.  Yeah, yeah.  So Peter should leave that shit alone because I don't think the horse even knows. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, the horse is fine.  Sometimes, though, the horse is kind of getting into it.  He's just kind of like, brr, brr, brr.  Really?  Brr, brr, brr.  They just, like, twitch and shit.  What do we have here?  Yeah, whoa.  Yeah, they kind of like it.  And boy, you know, you would think a horse would be a very virile animal.  Every horse, premature ejaculation.  What a loser.  When I watch it.  What a fucking sap.  How long do they last?  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  How long do you think they last?  You've been around horses.  When, when, when. 
[01:24:00]  He has.  He grew up around horses for a little while.  Well, I've never been around cumming horses.  Oh, wow.  You must have.  I've seen a horse fuck a couple of times.  Okay.  But mostly from the videos, all the chick has to do is, like, jack them off a little bit  and just suck on the tip.  And the thing, like, shoots like fucking K-Ro syrup.  That is so awful.  Amazing.  Have you ever seen a horse pussy?  No.  You want to see one?  No.  No, I don't.  They're really disgusting, too.  I can answer that right away.  You'll be amazed how much it looks like a black lady's pussy.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:24:30]  You'll be amazed.  Please don't.  No, no, no.  The famous picture.  That horse story made me ill.  No, that's not the one.  Yeah, that's bad.  You've got to do the one we always find.  Oh, but we found it years ago.  I forget.  I leave here feeling physically ill every time.  Yes.  Why?  Like many of our guests and the whole listening audience.  Oh, God.  Bill Burrow always says he hates leaving here and it's a nice, bright, sunny day.  He just feels dirty.  It's wrong.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It feels wrong.  All right.  If we can find the horse pussy pic that we've shown many times over the years.  I don't think.  I think it's too. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, here it is.  That's not it.  That's the one Danny just sent me.  Oh, God damn it.  I can't even look at that.  There's another one where there's no fingers in it, by the way, Sam.  That makes me want to donut.  Well, the last time we looked at that was years ago, so now those pictures go away.  You think they're gone?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  I can't look at that.  That's pretty hot.  Look at all the pink in there.  Amy, look at all the pink in there.  I checked it out.  I checked it out.  It made me want a donut.  I just thought you were one of the...  I think you're one of the guys.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I don't know why you guys say that.  I am not.  Ann, do you watch these videos alone or with a friend? 
[01:25:30]  I just watch these videos alone sometimes.  Because no matter what you're looking at online, I was trying to order a light from B&H Photo,  and within three clicks, I ended up on porn and, you know, horse fucking videos and things like that.  It comes up, right?  It just somehow you always gravitate toward the pornography and really the nasty stuff like animals.  You're making something like pop-ups came up, but you just Googled horse cock, didn't you?  Well, yeah. 
[01:26:00]  It's like, and then this window and this window, and I Googled it.  Yeah, multitasking.  You got him.  You wanted to learn about a donkey show?  We got a guy that went.  No.  I've heard about him.  I'm curious, to be honest with you.  I would check out a donkey show.  What the hell?  We're going to Mexico today.  Jeff in New Mexico.  Oh.  Jeff.  How's it going, guys?  Great.  Hey.  If you go down to Del Rio, Texas, and you're crossing the border of Mexico, there's this cool little place called Boys Town.  Titty Twister.  I love how he says it's a cool little place.  You know, where girls get fucked by donkeys. 
[01:26:30]  That's the kind of place everybody knows your name.  Right.  Just like Cheers.  Hold on, man.  The jokes are flying.  The jokes.  Jeff, we're killing.  Like horse cum.  We got some jokes in the air right now.  Jeff, let us breathe.  Jesus, Jeff.  So it's a cool little place called what?  Start from there.  Boys Town.  Boys Town?  Yes.  It's what it is.  It's like Disneyland for perverts, man.  I mean, it's right across the border of New Mexico.  They have taxi cabs. 
[01:27:00]  You can get anything from an eight ball of cocaine and a blowjob for 20 bucks.  I think that's our next destination.  That's our next gig.  Why didn't Jimmy film there?  Yeah, why not?  Jimmy should have done his show there.  Boys Town, guys.  Boys Town's a Cleveland.  Well, Boys Town sounds like it might go a little gay.  Yeah, I would never go to a place like Boys Town in Mexico.  Why are they calling it Boys Town?  I don't know.  I mean, I worked down there in the oil fields before and would sneak across the border and  have fun, you know, but I mean.  You see donkeys? 
[01:27:30]  I didn't do the donkey shows, but they do have donkey shows.  Then why is he on the phone?  Why is he even on the phone, Ant?  You're right.  Oh, God.  The myth of the donkey show.  This guy wants to talk about Miranda, actually.  She wants to talk about how you inseminate a horse.  Would you like to know this, Amy?  Oh, who wouldn't?  I feel like I understand.  Miranda?  Yeah.  Look, they're all excited.  Yeah.  Good morning.  They finally need me.  Good morning.  If it entails spitting it into the vagina, I really don't want to hear this.  Oh, it's nothing like that. 
[01:28:00]  Whenever, like, farmers, ranchers, anybody's ready to inseminate a mare, so they get these  nice thoroughbred horses, they let the horse mount a mare, and then whenever they think  it's ready to come, they will slide this long, leather-looking case over the cop, they'll  let the horse come in it, and then they'll bag it up so that they can inseminate it into  the mare, so they can get the exact breeding that they want to happen.  Well, why don't they just let them fucking shoot in the horse?  The mare is the romance in that. 
[01:28:30]  Because then, they, you know, they might waste a chance.  You never know what the horse is doing out there at night, or trying to get out of his  barn or stable.  You don't want anything to go wrong.  You have to make sure these things happen perfectly.  Poor horses.  Yeah, no kidding.  Guy thinks he's going to fucking shoot a load inside, and they throw a sleeve over it?  That's horrible.  Yep.  That's terrible.  Hi, Miranda.  Thank you for that.  Yeah.  Amazing.  You're welcome.  Thank you.  All right.  That's amazing.  That was just amazing.  Great.  Fantastic.  How did we get to this place? 
[01:29:00]  I don't know.  At the truck stops in Florida, they used to advertise the donkey shows through the CB.  Oh, wow.  Hey, good buddy.  Got us a donkey show.  You want that or not?  My opener said that he went to a donkey show in Mexico, and that they kind of, like, got  the donkey already, and the girl, like, a guy would go down on her, and then they kind  of just, like, back her up into the donkey. 
[01:29:30]  Wow.  And she took a good amount of it.  And he said it was really upset.  It was not, there was nothing sexy.  Nothing sexy.  And a bunch of guys just standing around a room, like a fight club type room.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  Not nice seating?  No, yeah.  I would so go to that.  Like the copa?  No condiments.  Yeah, yeah.  Would you go to that?  I would go to that.  I don't know.  It seems pretty sleazy.  I couldn't.  Let's go, let's look at donkey cock, because, I mean, Amy said, uh, well, Amy said she took  a lot.  I'm just, uh, I'm trying to, you know.  You can imagine it's big. 
[01:30:00]  Because guys have been fucked to death by horses, so maybe a donkey.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  That is upsetting.  Why?  I don't, I've always gone horseback riding.  I've never seen one.  I've never.  That just, like, sometimes they just hang there and it falls out.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  He's dressed in his traditional Mexican attire, that donkey.  Cinco de Mayo is right around the bend, guys.  Yes.  Yeah.  Get one of them at your party.  That's fucked up.  Oh, God.  It just looks sad. 
[01:30:30]  Jesus.  The animal kingdom.  So, we don't have anything on Occupy Wall Street.  We'll bring it back on track.  Nah, at some point.  No.  Well, they're making a big deal on the news.  Yeah, yeah.  They're, uh, they're making a big deal.  That's because they put out, uh, on their website.  They put flyers out saying that they're going to screw with the traffic.  Bloomberg said no shenanigans.  And the police are just going to fucking go nuts if these guys try anything.  But I don't see it.  They don't have the numbers that they did when they first started. 
[01:31:00]  No one gives a shit anymore.  Like I said, the causes just come, uh, once a week you get a new cause that everybody gets  behind on Twitter and Facebook.  And this one's done.  They don't seem too smart.  We saw Occupy Cleveland.  Do you swear?  It was a tent and, like, two people.  Even that was said.  How about Occupy the City of Cleveland?  Yeah.  They can't even do that.  Yeah.  Somebody show up.  Never mind the fucking tent.  You need a city that's occupied before you do your occupied work.  Right.  You're right, Anne.  Literally, Occupy Cleveland.  Occupy Cleveland was one tent. 
[01:31:30]  One tent.  No joke.  And a little card table set up.  With information, I think.  Yeah.  I walked by it.  I'm like, time chess.  Ridiculous.  I walked by it.  I was thinking maybe to film.  There was nothing to film.  Yeah.  It was sad.  There was nothing to film anywhere in Cleveland.  But, uh, yeah, I don't think anything's going to happen.  I hope there's a few people, because I want to see some, uh, tasing videos from the  NYPD.  Nothing better than a good tasing video.  Has anybody ever been tased in here?  Uh, in here?  No.  No.  I think we wanted to do it with somebody, but then, uh, the lawyers jump in and say no. 
[01:32:00]  They say no to everything.  No tasing.  So that's why we got to talk about donkey cock.  Yeah, yeah.  We used to do things.  Now we have to find things to talk about.  Now we just talk about donkey cock and cum.  You're doing God's work.  Thank you.  Yes.  We had to switch to doing God's work.  Mm-hmm.  Well, now we've had some, like, shock collars and stuff in here.  Oh, yeah, we did.  We did what E-Rock had one on, right?  Yeah.  The shock collar.  And didn't Jimmy take a kick or a punch from him?  Oh, Jimmy's been beaten up by, uh, MMA people.  Every UFC fighter imaginable at this point. 
[01:32:30]  So, why don't we, uh, take a break, Amy?  Ah, good, because I've got to go wee-wee.  And we're very happy about that.  May 11th through the 13th, Riviera Comedy Club in Las Vegas.  So you have to fly out there once a month?  Yeah.  Just to do that?  Yeah.  Wow.  I love it.  I love it.  I didn't think I'd like Vegas, but I'm into it.  So what do you do?  You stay for a couple days, or is it in and out?  Yeah.  I go in.  I stay, uh, Thursday to Monday.  Nice.  And I do it up.  Righteous.  Trying to get in.  How many weeks they got you for?  Or how many months?  Like, probably a year. 
[01:33:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  I'm trying to build it.  It's been, the shows have been really fun.  That's very fucking cool.  Yeah.  Is it a different type of show you're doing, or?  Um, they're calling Amy Schumer Slaughterhouse, and I bring some hot, sassy female comics with  me.  Some sassafras.  I know.  It's a fun show.  It's dirty.  Well, I-  Shocking.  Like, let me just surprise everybody.  Donkey show.  Do you like Vegas?  I do.  I didn't used to, but I like, I really like the, uh, Thursday and Sunday show, because  it's just a little more chill.  Yeah.  People aren't.  No, I mean, but do you like Vegas as far as, when you're not performing? 
[01:33:30]  I like it during the week.  Slower?  Yeah.  I mean, it's like a-  More manageable?  It's an interesting city when it's not.  Have you, uh, gone a couple blocks off the strip to see the real Vegas, where it's like  down and dirty?  No.  Oh, take that ride.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't know.  See, I love checking out people and stuff.  Yeah.  Well, I like the shitty casinos.  Like, I like the really- I went- Last time I was there, I went with Florentine.  We went to this casino.  They had dealer-tainers, which were-  Oh, no.  The dealers were dressed as imperson-  No.  Like, the worst impersonators.  You're just, the whole time, you're like- 
[01:34:00]  Ugh.  You're trying to figure out, you're like, are you Bonnie Raitt or Michael Jackson?  I can't even pull it off.  The waitresses are pregnant.  It's like, you're like, ugh.  Oh, God.  But I love it.  That's old Vegas.  Yeah.  I love checking out all that.  Over in the air is old Vegas.  Old Vegas, yeah.  It is old Vegas.  Oh, man.  That's great.  Yeah.  I love that old Vegas feel.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It feels very wrong.  You go near a block or two off the strip.  There's like, porn shops and really sad motels and all that stuff.  Really.  None of the glitz, huh?  Really interesting, though.  Yeah. 
[01:34:30]  All those flyers all over the ground of those girls.  A lot of drug addicts.  A lot of people that went to Vegas with a dream, and that's where they're living now.  It's, it's, you gotta check it out, man.  It's such a bummer.  Even if you have somebody at your table that's, you know, that has the vibe like they're gambling  because they can't go home unless they win.  You're just like, oh, let me buy you a bus ticket.  There is a very thin veneer of glamour and happiness and fun in Vegas, but very thin because  just a little scratch, and it's like, oh, there's the depression, the alcoholism, the 
[01:35:00]  fucking gambling addiction, the drugs, yeah, the rape, the prostitution.  I got a proposition that the palms, I was working there, it was during the day, I was  going to the gym, and a guy in the elevator legitimately, he was like asking me these  weird questions, he's like, so do you live here, and I was like, in the palms, and he  was just like, in Vegas, and he was just asking, and finally he just went, how much?  Wow.  And he was dead serious, and I was like, right, do you think this is my get-up I go out in? 
[01:35:30]  It's like gray sweat shorts.  You're insulting me.  If I was a prostitute, I would fucking look the part.  But I did have no makeup on, and without makeup, I looked like.  So how much did you charge?  50 bucks.  Oh, okay.  He seemed like a nice guy.  Okay.  Yeah.  I could see myself looking a little bit.  That's so weird, and you were just on your way to the gym.  Yeah.  Elevator at the palms.  I wonder if that's his move, and I wonder if it works.  I don't know.  Like if a girl just is like, maybe this will be my shot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Amy, how much?  50.  50? 
[01:36:00]  That's cold.  I said that.  Oh, yeah.  I was asking, too.  I was like, I'll do it for a peach cobbler.  All right.  One peach cobbler.  And then you've got to go to Vinny's Place.  No, I like Vinny's Place.  Vinny does a very good job with his club.  Stress Factory, New Brunswick, New Jersey, May 17th through the 19th.  Uh-huh.  That should sell out.  I hope so.  It really should sell out.  I like that club.  It's fun.  The crowds are good there.  And it's not Cleveland.  That's my favorite part of it.  It's my favorite part of everywhere.  We're going to have Bear Grylls in here in a little while.  Oh, look out. 
[01:36:30]  He's a man.  He's got a new book.  He's a man.  He is such a man.  He eats bugs.  I wonder, are you guys going to look like men next to him?  No.  Okay.  Okay.  Not at all.  His name's Bear.  Bear.  Just his name is Bear.  Stop.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Maybe he'll fuck all of us.  You're wearing your nice shirt.  I heard he's Christian.  Blood, Sweat, and Tears is the name of his book.  And he got fired or something.  Yeah, I'd like to hear what the story is behind that.  Mud, Sweat, and Tears.  Mud, Sweat, and Tears.  I got Blood, Sweat, and Tears on my sheet. 
[01:37:00]  I'm looking at the book, yo.  Oh, man.  Mud.  Who fucked up?  Who fucked up?  Sam.  Sam's too busy thinking of Troy Kwan and his girlfriend fucking through his door.  Hearing those sounds.  And Sam wouldn't jerk off.  I don't get it.  But I know Troy.  You didn't hear Troy.  Yeah, but I knew he was there.  You just know he's in there.  I understand what you're saying.  We can explain the scenario, Tami Schumer, and then we'll get her opinion after the break.  Okay.  All right?  All right.  All right.  Yes.  The Opie History Show. 
[01:37:30]  All right.  We got Vegas people mad through your tears.  Why?  This guy goes, Vegas is a pit, go three more blocks west of the Strip, and you're in a  regular area, another mile or two, and you're in a nice suburb.  A lot of nice suburbs.  I've heard all that, too.  Oh, yeah.  I don't worry about it.  We don't get to do that shit.  We go to Vegas, we go to a casino and do our thing, and then we're out of there.  Yeah, what, are we going to walk through people's neighborhoods?  One day.  One day. 
[01:38:00]  Have us over for dinner.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, exactly.  How about you do that?  Invite us to the suburbs.  Show us.  I just know if you go a couple blocks off the Strip, it's very, very different and down  and dirty, big time.  And then maybe past that, it starts to get normal again.  I don't fucking know.  I want to scold Amy before we get Bear Grylls in here.  Yeah, man.  She got food poisoning.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  And I knew about this, and I forgot until you just brought it up during the break.  I was hospitalized.  Hospitalized with dehydration, right?  Yeah.  You were dying?  I was hallucinating. 
[01:38:30]  What?  I've been throwing up for five hours from every hole.  Wow.  Yep.  And they were like the club.  I was supposed to do stand-up live in Phoenix.  The club owner's mom was in town.  Don't say the food, by the way.  And the manager.  Because I want to have a little thing with this.  Okay.  I won't say the food.  Go ahead.  So you're in Phoenix.  I'm in Phoenix.  I get there the night before, I do five hours of press for the show, and then I have  a meal, and then right before the show.  And I was all fired up. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, there's like a cute boy coming, and David Spade was supposed to come, and I never  met him.  Oh, man.  And then, yeah, and then I just started vacating.  Did it ruin your show?  I couldn't.  I was in the hospital.  You didn't even do the shows?  I didn't do the show.  I was in the hospital.  David Spade wound up doing it.  Five hours of press.  Wow.  Five hours of press.  I went to Phoenix just to go to the hospital.  Oh, man.  How long were you in the hospital?  From 8 p.m. to 8 a.m.  My worst food, poison, and I'm just bringing this up because I want to know if it happened  to you.  Yeah.  I was blowing water out of my ass for so long that I started dry heaving from my butt 
[01:39:30]  where nothing was coming out anymore, but the muscles down there were still trying  to do whatever.  Yeah.  I was scared I was going to get a pro-lifed asshole.  I had nothing left in me.  That's when it's the worst, when you have nothing left in the cramping.  Yeah.  You have nothing left.  You still are nauseous.  You still want to pee.  Because your muscles are still squeezing.  Yeah.  They want everything out.  But it's all water.  It's the weirdest feeling.  I'm like, what the fuck?  It's like the title of Bear's book.  Yeah.  Mud, sweat, and tears out of your hat.  Mud, sweat, and tears. 
[01:40:00]  It was gross.  And I really thought, I just need to get this out of my system and I'll be able to do  my show.  So I was like blow drying my hair and then I would puke in the sink.  Wow.  And I was crying.  It was bad.  Were you just really weak?  But you're like, I got to get on that stage.  I was shaking.  I was like, I've performed really sick before, but there was no chance.  Oh, man.  What are the symptoms of dehydration?  How do you know you have it?  I mean, like, first your lips get real crack-headed.  You know? 
[01:40:30]  Oh, that's the first thing I noticed.  But then I was so, yeah, I was like hallucinating.  I was laying on the bathroom floor and I thought my mom was there.  It was the club owner's mom.  Yeah.  Wow.  You were really bad.  I was, she was like, I still was like, I think I'm going to be able to perform.  She was like, you're like going to die.  No, you're not performing.  Yeah.  They took me right to the hospital.  Oh, so who made the call about the hospital?  Like who decided?  The mom.  Said, yeah, you got to go.  She was like, do you have health insurance?  And I was like, and I had to think.  I was like, do I?  I was like, yes, right now I have it. 
[01:41:00]  And she brought me there.  Do you think they'll invite you back?  To the hospital?  Yeah.  They invited me back.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Good, good, good.  David Spade, like, tried to do me a favor so I would still get paid and headlined the  show.  The club was psyched.  I got food poisoning.  Yeah, right?  It was a great night for them.  Oh, man.  Spade did, you know, an hour for free.  Did Spade give you some money?  No, he didn't get paid.  So you still got paid?  I'm going to get paid because.  That's awesome.  The hotel I was at is paying what I would have been paid.  Very cool.  No, you don't know if David Spade's a good guy because you didn't meet him. 
[01:41:30]  He seems great.  We've been.  We've written.  We've written to each other.  He seems great.  And you started feeling better, I guess, the next morning.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But oh, God.  But the woman in the bed next to me, she's dead.  I mean, she was screaming.  I never saw her.  There was a curtain.  But she was like this, I think, elderly black lady.  And she was just she was driving and just these noises like.  Oh, wow.  Don't turn your back on me, Lord.  Jesus.  She was talking to Jesus. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  She was talking to Jesus.  And she was also talking shit about the nurses like through prayer.  So she was like, Jesus, this nurse doesn't know what she's doing.  Jesus.  It was so.  Oh, God.  See, you go in the hospital for some rest and they always put you in a room with some fucking  person.  It's a sick person, damn it.  But how is that helping anybody?  But Jackie, who opens for me on the road, she she stayed with me and like, you know, in 
[01:42:30]  the chair, like sure was her.  Yeah, I don't know.  That comfy visitor chair.  Oh, and you're like 1950.  There's a cot right there.  They're just like, no, she can't.  But I got recognized when I was in the ER and they treated me way better, which was awesome  for me.  But what bullshit?  You know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was, I got rushed through and they treated me great, but it was good.  That's part of the privilege of being, uh, Amy Schumer, Amy Schumer, like a dickhead  about it.  A little fame, but you're like, these nurses, you know, they're just putting different stuff 
[01:43:00]  in your IV.  They don't tell you what it is.  They, your life is in their fucking hands.  Quite literally.  Yeah.  Yes.  It is weird.  I feel my neck.  They're like, that's the morphine.  It's like, can you just tell me what you're putting in my body?  Yeah.  Is that too much for a lady to ask?  They really gave you morphine for food poisoning?  Yeah.  Wow.  Because you probably were hurting a lot.  Yeah.  The cramping.  That hurt went right away, didn't it?  Oh yeah.  Because that disappeared.  I was still nauseous though.  It was just a bummer.  But the morphine was sweet.  I would imagine if your muscles aren't, uh, if they don't have fluid in them and they're 
[01:43:30]  drying out, that's gotta be paid for.  It'll cramp up a little bit.  But I was like psyched because I was like, oh my God, I'm going to be so skinny.  I'm going to leave here so svelte.  But all the saline solution bloated you up.  Bloated me.  So I had to perform the morning I got out, I had to perform in Vegas that night.  I had to fly from Phoenix to Vegas.  Oh my God.  Like hours after I got out of the hospital.  And I had like, um, my stomach was like distended like a third world country kid.  Oh my God.  It's really hard to do my like sassy act on stage. 
[01:44:00]  With a pot belly?  Right.  Where it looks like I'm hiding a pregnancy.  I was like, this sucks.  The crowd is like, yeah.  I'm like, everybody wants this.  They're like, no.  No, not really.  Not tonight.  That was the worst.  That was a show to get through.  Yeah.  Now, uh, you want to guess the food?  Um.  Guess the food.  It's Phoenix.  Phoenix, Arizona.  What got Amy so sick that she ended up in the hospital?  It has to be sushi.  All right.  We're, we're on the right track.  Yeah.  I'm a genius.  Some type of fish.  It's in that family.  Yeah.  I still can't even think about the words. 
[01:44:30]  Um.  Crab cakes.  Oh.  Always crab cakes.  What a smart lady.  Jimmy said he just got sick from crab cakes, too.  It's always crab cakes.  I was telling Amy.  So humiliating.  Desert crabs.  Is that what you had?  Yeah.  Just so dumb.  They bring them in fresh.  A crab cake in Phoenix.  From the desert.  I always feel like.  All right.  God damn it.  But I feel like a place like Phoenix, they fly that shit in fresh every day.  But.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I take chances in some of these places.  Cargo hold is.  I never even think about that stuff. 
[01:45:00]  I'll take a risk.  Now I'm so scared.  Everything.  Mayonnaise is so dangerous.  Like if you.  You ever.  If you own a restaurant, you have a responsibility to treat your mayonnaise like it's nuclear fucking  waste.  You can't leave that shit out too long.  No.  You can't leave the crab cakes out too long if they have mayonnaise in them.  You know what I mean?  Mayo turns.  So fast.  Really quick.  On a dime.  I'm not totally out of the woods yet.  Could we maybe just something else?  Oh, wow.  Just.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  It's so.  It's still with me. 
[01:45:30]  It's killing.  What?  Why?  Did he get.  Did he get sick?  Bob gets sick every time he's in here.  Yeah.  All we have to do is show him a picture of a prolapsed asshole or something and he'll have  his head in the garbage pail.  Really?  He killed a puke?  Oh, dude.  What are you doing, dude?  So you're not going to eat crab cakes anytime soon?  No.  They are delicious.  I am so over crab cakes.  You sure you're over crab cakes?  Yeah.  I feel very over.  Can we get some crab?  No, please don't do that.  Oh, my God.  Why are you going to do this?  Like, when people ask me what I ate, I couldn't even, like, write it down.  I had to leave the room and my head shot. 
[01:46:00]  We don't want to just, we don't want to, like, just, you know, having, this is a good show  and all, but we need, like, you know, we need the big fucking.  No.  Leave Amy alone.  Don't make her vomit.  Please don't make me vomit.  We just want you to smell crab cakes.  Oh, my God.  I can't.  I can't.  How long ago was this?  Three weeks.  Wow.  And you're still fucked up about it.  Yeah.  I can only now say crab cakes.  I really couldn't even, I couldn't even say the word.  You couldn't even say the word.  And also, when you're puking that thing, like, that's the thing. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  You're staring at it in the bowl.  Oh, God.  You can still taste the crab cakes through your vomit.  That vomiting where your body takes over, you're not choosing to vomit.  You're just, it's making you vomit.  Okay.  Yeah, that's pretty bad.  It was.  Was it a bad texture, too, coming up?  Yes.  Yes, it was.  Lumpy.  It was one of those crab cakes that had other things in it, like peppers.  Oh, God.  It was just the worst.  It was the worst.  E-Rock, you ever have food poisoning?  Oh, please.  Yeah, it was.  Yeah.  What'd you eat?  We weren't quite sure, but my wife and I got it at the same time. 
[01:47:00]  You're married?  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  That's what everyone says.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, we had it for about two and a half days.  It was just nonstop throwing up and diarrhea.  Yeah, if you have health insurance, like, go to the hospital.  Well, yeah.  And just cut down that timetable.  Yeah.  It's a story I've told a million times, but I'll just tell the one part of it.  I got food poisoning as bad as you, and it was because I decided to get a hand  and Swiss sandwich and potato salad and go to the beach and then let my lunch sit there 
[01:47:30]  for about an hour.  In the beach sun.  And it had, it was like July or August, it was hot.  Boiling.  And I still assume that it was good to eat.  It still, you know, it still tasted good, but the mayo obviously said, fuck this, son.  Oh, man.  What an idiot.  Can you eat potato salad again?  Yeah, I love potato salad.  Oh, okay.  German potato salad especially.  Vinegar-y, German potato salad.  That's what makes it, there's vinegar in German potato salad?  Oh, yeah, that's the difference.  But I'll eat all potato salad.  I've been real scared of all food. 
[01:48:00]  What about crab cakes?  Yeah.  I'll have one if you have one.  No.  Oh, God.  Please don't.  No.  No.  Please don't.  No.  She's like begging.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Because people beg on our show, please don't do that.  Yes.  Please don't.  Pretty much that.  Every one of our guests.  I'm not ready.  Show in the bedroom.  I'm so not out of the woods.  Yeah.  Would you like to see E-Rock's mayo videos?  No.  E-Rock.  I feel confident in the mayo.  E-Rock, how much mayo did he eat that day?  Oh, God.  We try to get him to finish a jar of mayo. 
[01:48:30]  I almost completed the jar of mayo.  I am, too.  I feel real bad.  You've never seen the mayo videos?  Like, three-fourths, the jar.  I've seen them.  I love them.  I've seen them all.  Yeah, she's seen them all.  When Sam starts furiously typing, like, it's dangerous.  You know, it's not going to be good.  It's frightening.  E-Rock, what happened to your eyes?  Oh, Bear Grylls.  I lost all...  Bear Grylls, thank God.  You're lucky.  Yes, Bear Grylls is a savior.  I'm so happy.  He's your best friend today.  I know we have to get him in, too.  Yeah, okay, but E-Rock...  No, I'm not watching.  E-Rock puked so much, his eyes turned... 
[01:49:00]  I lost all color in my eyes.  It was just red.  Oh, you broke all the blood vessels.  Dark red.  The entire whites, not just a little bit.  It was scary.  I think the people in the background aren't really paying attention to E-Rock in the city.  No, just kind of drinking coffee, hanging out.  People are eating like it's no thing.  And E-Rock is literally dying in the garbage pill.  All right, let's get Bear Grylls in here.  Yeah, let's get Bear Grylls in here, then.  Should I move?  He saved you.  No, no, that's good.  I'm okay.  No, you're good right there.  There he is, Bear Grylls.  Hey, Bear.  All right.  Yeah.  Finally, a real man is in the studio. 
[01:49:30]  How you been, man?  What's up, Bear?  Oh, my God.  You can feel the testosterone.  Oh, yeah.  Good to see you again.  Before it was all estrogen.  Take a seat.  That's Amy.  Amy Schumer.  Very funny comic.  Yeah.  Amy.  He's not big fans.  Big fans.  He's a huge fan.  There you go.  All right.  Are we on air?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we just love to.  I mean, he's a massive Bruce fan.  Who?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Kenny?  No, no.  I didn't hear.  What did he say?  Roland's a massive Bruce fan.  Great Bruce fan.  Oh, you like Bruce?  I'm with you. 
[01:50:00]  He doesn't shut up about Bruce.  He's mad.  Why is he talking to you about Bruce Springsteen?  He's talking.  He's like kind of drooling me.  He can't booze.  He can't stop being there.  That's exactly what he sounds like.  He's honest.  I love him.  I got to go with him tomorrow.  You're going to the concert.  I'm not a huge Springsteen fan, but I guess it's the last night of the worldwide tour or  something that's special.  You and me can't judge unless we've been.  I've been.  Oh, I've been.  I've been.  That concert's going to be six hours.  Oh, God.  He's a bit wordy in between songs.  He's got a lot to say.  He's a bit wordy.  A lot to talk about. 
[01:50:30]  I don't want to hear it.  I bet he'll talk about the past.  Yeah.  You know, back in Jersey when I was...  The girls used to walk by on the corner.  On the boardwalk.  He's looking so upset now, Roland.  Oh, yeah.  Roland's going to be very upset.  Don't mess with Roland's Bruce Springsteen.  That's not good.  He looks.  He goes, Bruce.  Bruce.  Bruce.  You know the whole deal.  That's exactly what Roland sounds like.  Are you a super fan of any bands?  That's his number one. 
[01:51:00]  Who's your number one band?  Probably.  I've got quite a cheesy taste in music.  Yeah?  I've got like Cowboy Junkies.  Yeah.  All right.  You know them?  Yeah.  Yes.  What was their song?  They've got like the Eagles, you know?  They've got like kind of good old stuff.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  What was the Cowboy Junkies song?  Yeah, I don't remember.  I'm trying to remember, too.  What was their big song?  Like Whispering Horse and stuff like that.  Just random.  Oh.  Yeah.  You just like the mention of animals in all songs.  No, it's not that.  The Eagles.  I like guitar stuff and acoustic stuff. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  Did you get fired?  Huh?  Did you get fired?  I'm mad.  Oh.  I know.  I know.  What can you say about that?  Why are you fired?  Everyone loves you.  Well, people are making a big deal about it.  We had productions on a couple of shows, which was sad.  But, you know, my granddad used to say, you've got to finish stuff strong.  Finish it five minutes too early.  I called an end to Man vs. Wild that felt the right thing to do.  Right.  Difficult, but the right thing.  We've had a lot of risk over the years.  I've got three young kids.  Right.  So they brought me a couple of other projects, but they weren't quite the right thing. 
[01:52:00]  So I said kind of no to those.  So we've agreed to go, you know, separate ways.  But, you know, they'll survive.  I'll survive.  Oh, so they were trying to move you on to other shows with Discovery, right?  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They had some terrible ideas.  No, they were good ideas.  Oh, so Man vs. Wild, you felt like it was time.  Man vs. Wild was time.  You know, we'd have seven seasons.  Grills Grills, a cooking show.  There you go.  Or maybe like an urban thing with teeth.  I have lots of kind of quite mad offers.  And it's like, I don't want to do a cooking show. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  I might have enough doing a cooking show.  You don't want to.  But at the moment, I mean.  Right.  But, you know, they'll survive and I'll survive.  And actually, they've been amazing for seven years.  It's been a kind of great run.  It was a great run.  Yeah, a great run.  Isn't it a thing where you start, like, thinking about your life and assessing the fact that,  you know, family guys, and you just don't want to take the risks?  I felt like that a little bit for a while.  But, you know, I've always loved what I've done on Man vs. Wild.  I'll still be doing that.  I'm still going to do, you know, new shows where we're, you know, based around adventure  and all that good stuff.  But did you start feeling like you had to up yourself? 
[01:53:00]  Like you'd get a little more riskier as the seasons went on?  I was trying to kind of rein it back.  Oh, yeah.  But, you know, I mean, the crew used to say season one, I was like 80% reckless.  And I went to about 110% by season four.  And then I kind of got it back to about 85.  Right.  So it's still crazy.  You know, you can't go on like that.  And, you know, I think sometimes you've got to listen to the quiet voice in the back.  And I wanted to finish a bit more on our terms and kind of, you know, ratings are rubbish.  You've got to go.  I didn't want it to be like that. 
[01:53:30]  Right.  I wanted to finish strong.  And but they've been amazing partners.  And I've been super lucky for that.  And, you know, we just kind of parted ways.  Yeah, parted ways.  After seven years, what was your number one thing that you did on that show?  The craziest to you.  Well, you know, I mean, there's been loads of crazy.  So my great thing is it is about the bonds you create with people in difficult times.  Oh, I'm talking about right.  And my best buddies, those guys, you know, all the same guys to film the whole journey with.  You know, they'll say my line many times.  I'll say their line many times.  You know, there's no ego. 
[01:54:00]  There's total love.  And it's it's a great kind of strong thing that lasts.  So, yeah, they were where you were, but they had cameras in any day.  Someone's got a video of this was way harder.  And they had to do it backwards.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I only have to walk forward.  And a lot of times they're walking backwards.  A lot of times a lot of times they did the stunt before Bear Grylls did.  I know he's sliding down a glacier.  I'm like, wait a minute.  How did the camera guy get to the bottom already?  You're absolutely right.  Oh, that's great.  I'm not taking anything away from you, sir. 
[01:54:30]  What's the most hurt you ever got?  Oh, yeah.  I broke my back.  I broke my shoulder.  I broke my elbows, toes, fingers.  You know, you name it.  Yeah, but did you ever have food poisoning?  That's the real shit.  Yeah, I've had a lot of vomiting and diarrhea on the show.  And a lot of times it was filmed.  And a lot of times it went in.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, she got food poisoning from a little dish of crab cakes.  You know the stuff he ate on that show, Amy?  I'm sorry.  I'm a loser.  But I appreciate what you do.  I appreciate your contribution. 
[01:55:00]  I'll tell you, the crew aren't going to miss that.  There were a number of times where I was on a...  I remember one time I was up with rock face.  I'd eaten a dodgy snake that morning.  A dodgy snake?  A dodgy snake.  Not like one of those dependable ones.  Right.  You can count on.  A good star-kissed snake.  Anyway, everything was heading south and fast.  And like, you know, you can't stop it when it's...  You know, you can be as strong as you like, bro.  And I was halfway up.  I said to Simon, I said, look, turn the camera off.  Give me...  This isn't going to take long.  Twenty seconds.  Oh, shit.  I was holding on one hand, foot in the crack with the other, trying to get my trousers on. 
[01:55:30]  Holy mother...  They die into, like, free air and all the crew...  That's amazing!  Oh, man!  You shit down a mountain.  They're not upset at all.  Well, Moses said tablets.  You shit down a mountain.  That is so funny.  See, he's a real fucking man.  He's a real man.  Then I go like this, pull my trousers, I look up, and I go, darn, yeah.  See the camera there blinking?  You know, a little red light.  Oh, it's on.  God, Simon, it's nothing sacred.  Come on, brother.  That's great for the gag reel when the season's over. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, bloopers!  Come on, let's see the bloopers.  Man versus wild bloopers?  I'd watch.  I'd watch that.  That's funny.  Well, they always say the bit like when I fall over and trip over something.  That never goes in.  Yeah.  It's not heroic enough.  No, no, no.  I'm always trying to get them put in, because that's the kind of funny bits.  Yeah, yeah, you can't be a hero all the time.  I know.  Tell me about it.  And so what are you doing now as far as keeping that adrenaline buzz going for you?  Because you're an adrenaline junkie kind of a guy.  Yeah, kind of, you know, it's always been, I suppose, a part of my life. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, we've just finished a big climb in Utah.  We did a thing called Masters of Movement for Degree, which people can see at theadrenalist.com.  Which I was proud of.  It was good fun.  We're just launching Mud Sweat and Tears over here.  Yes, yeah.  The number one bestseller.  It's been 10 weeks in the U.K. by some miracle.  Congratulations.  That's so awesome.  That's great, man.  This is the first kind of...  I sure hope there's a lot of pictures in here.  ...over here.  I want to come to you guys first.  Yeah.  On the Open Antony show.  That's great, man.  Good morning.  Apparently Bruce is a fan as well. 
[01:57:00]  Yes, yes.  Of the Open Antony.  Did you know that?  Bruce.  Bruce.  Bruce.  Wait, who is?  Bruce.  Bruce.  Springsteen.  This is...  Oh, man.  Is this now your entire life here?  Well, this is kind of the story.  Loads of people would say, where did you learn the skills of Man vs. Wild that we've seen  for how many years?  And this is the story from growing up, being taught to climb by my dad, through my time in  the Special Forces, and my combat survival job, and then climbing and skydiving there,  through to Everest, and lots of other expeditions, and then the Man vs. Wild.  He just touched me by accident, and it was the first time a man's ever touched me. 
[01:57:30]  Real?  Yeah.  I felt the electricity.  Oh, technically...  I hugged both of you this morning.  Yes.  I know.  Yes.  No, it's the same hand I write my backside with him.  Oh, wow.  I don't care.  I'll take it.  I mean, it's turned on.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, so you were in Special Forces.  Oh, yeah.  And you learned a lot from being in there, I would gather.  Well, a lot of, you know, my job there was teaching the combat survival, so a lot of  the stuff that I've used on Man vs. Wild from the skydiving and the climbing and that 
[01:58:00]  side of it, the medics, demolitions, even got a bit of that into season six of the show.  But, yeah, you know, so this is the kind of story of where it all came from and the  struggles and the kind of, you know, fights through it.  Can you make a fire, like, anywhere out of anything?  I swear to God.  That's amazing.  Because every time you see...  That's not amazing you hack a man.  Of course, a fire is the first question.  Let me tag his question, because I just saw it recently.  There was some show, I don't even know the name of it, but I'm like, this is Man vs. 
[01:58:30]  Wild.  It's a couple or something.  And they did the fire thing, but I'm like, all right.  But they're obviously carrying something on them that makes it a little easier.  So, yeah.  Yeah, I just want to know, in the middle of nowhere, you are just you.  You have nothing on you.  All nature around you, you're in the woods.  You know, that's my job, in the same way, can you press all the buttons and stuff?  But they always have a lot.  It's going to kick out of sunny fires, but, like, you can do it with ice, you can do it  with, like...  How?  Oh, there's loads of cool ways.  Even a cell phone.  I showed the other day on the show how you can do it with a cell phone.  And then afterwards, the camera guy, Simon, he just goes, do you know what? 
[01:59:00]  They're going to be tens of thousands of players all around the world hating you.  Yeah.  All the kids go, Dad, can I borrow your cell phone?  Butchering it and shorting it in a circuit.  And the whole thing went crazy.  Yeah, and then, boom, fire.  But how do you do it with ice?  But I love it, because it's, like, innovative and you've got to be resourceful.  Ice is like a giant magnifying glass, so you kind of smooth it off.  Oh, man, you make a lens with it.  I would just look at the ice and start crying.  I would die.  And know I'm going to die.  If somebody drops me off in Newark, I'm done for. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, because these other shows...  Having said that, there have been a few times where I've been in jungles and it's been  torrential rain, so you couldn't even hold a conversation like this.  And with the best will in the world, you're not going to sell a fire with flamethrowers  and anything, you know?  Right.  Sometimes you resign yourself to that.  Nature's going to win.  It's a night without a fire.  You need to get back into your cave.  You need to have a healthy respect of nature.  Yeah, definitely.  It's like, I think, you know, nature's like your mama.  Yeah.  You respect her, she'll be good to you.  You disrespect her, she's going to teach you a lesson you're never going to forget. 
[02:00:00]  And definitely, you know, when it's raining like that, sometimes you've got to stuff that  straw and grass down your shirt, down your pants, huddle up in the crooked tree and just  wait it out.  Yeah, you're big on insulating.  Big insulator.  Big insulator.  Me, I hit it to Patagonia.  Go to Patagonia.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that's cool.  Have you been there?  Oh, no, I mean the store.  No, we mean the store.  Yeah, yeah.  The store.  You can buy stuff where it looks like you're going into the wilderness.  See what a man does?  Oh, yeah, you've been there. 
[02:00:30]  But you're just walking around Manhattan with it, you know.  Yeah, wow.  What are you going to know?  You kind of feel like you're being adventurous.  I was watching one of my shows.  I meant the store.  Yeah.  How funny is that?  He's been to the place and Amy's been to the store.  I'm like, no, I'm an entitled white girl.  Yeah.  I just hiked the Pitons.  You know that in St. Lucia?  Great.  That's brilliant.  That was an extra climb.  Anybody?  Hey, look at you.  Is it really?  Yeah.  Good job.  Ropes?  Anything?  No.  Clamps?  Nope.  None of that, but it's like a climb climb.  Is it a climb?  Yeah.  Sense of achievement at the top?  Yeah. 
[02:01:00]  No, actually, no.  It was really anticlimactic.  There was no view.  It's just more rocks.  And she's like totally overgrown.  So we're like, we just believe that we're at the top of the destination, isn't it?  Yeah.  What's the best view you've ever seen?  He went to Mount Everest.  I know, but still.  Yeah, Everest was pretty.  I mean, it was amazing.  It was dawn.  It was three and a half month climb.  You were 11.  How old were you?  11.  I was 11, yeah.  Oh, no.  Bear's been on our show many times, and I'm trying to remember.  You've been to the top, but you can only stay there, what, 15 minutes or something? 
[02:01:30]  Half hour?  Well, we'd had a load of stuff go wrong at the stage.  We'd had two guys die of the cold, two fell, and it was like a whole thing was a bit of a  mess at this stage.  But we were running out of oxygen.  We were there like 10 minutes, long enough to kind of turn around and start to move.  But, you know, it was amazing.  You see that curvature of the earth, and it's like, you watch the dawn come up over Tibet,  and you're very aware you're somewhere special, you know, in the real, in the best sense  of the word.  But it was kind of, it wasn't the exhortation, like you say.  I think it was more kind of, that came at the end when you're safe. 
[02:02:00]  You're finally safe.  Yeah, I would assume once you reach the summit, you have your time, the second you turn around  to go down, all you're thinking is, God, I want to just be home.  Just please get me in the bathroom.  Oh, I just want to go home.  Yeah.  Like the thrill of the climb.  That's why so many accidents, the vast majority of the accidents happen on the descent, is  you want to be able to click your fingers and be in that bar.  Yeah.  You get kind of lazy.  And you get, and you get, you slow, and you let that fatigue become overwhelming, and  you've got to keep the adrenaline that's firing on the way out, fire you down.  You see the website that came out, uh, uh, the dead people that are on the mountain? 
[02:02:30]  Oh.  Well, there are, you know, we have a hundred and eighty bodies up there when we were there.  A hundred and eighty.  You know, there were like a hundred and eighty still on the mountain.  But supposedly, some of these dead bodies are really famous, and they're, they're marks  for, for you guys.  They found, they found Mallory's body a few years ago, perfectly preserved from 1924.  Wow.  Still in his tweeds, ripped open where he'd fallen, skin alabaster white.  You saw that?  It's all, you know, so it's like, totally preserved in minus forty degrees.  Wow, yeah.  The sun, but bleached in the sun.  Wow.  Oof, that's freaky.  But what they didn't find is the camera that will say whether or not he ever reached 
[02:03:00]  the summit.  Oh, wow.  Three years before, you know.  So that's what the hunt is always on for.  But the thing is, it's hard, you know, I mean, we have one guy out there just trying to get  the ring off one of the corpse's fingers for the guy's wife, and he slipped and fell in  the process of just trying to get, so it's hard enough to get a ring, let alone bodies  off or hunting for cameras and films.  Yeah, no one can really, you can't really wrap your mind around how intense an environment  that is, unless you've been there. 
[02:03:30]  Like, you can describe it, yeah, it's cold and windy.  Yeah, and I'm thinking, oh, yeah, you know, sometimes the buildings here in Manhattan  really make a breeze.  But no, that's deadly cold wind, treacherous terrain.  Cold and windy isn't fun after a while, do you know what I mean?  I always find whenever I'm warm and safe, all these things sound romantic.  It's like the producers who say to my man, but as well, we found the worst jungle, I'm  going, I'm there, let's do it, you know.  And then you're there and it's like, holy smoke, you know, it's no longer.  Why couldn't I have green screened this? 
[02:04:00]  But they're in mighty adventure, I suppose.  But then somebody, like, you start something like that and you know not everyone's going  to make it.  Like, how do you keep going?  If somebody, you know, like...  I think partly because for me it'd be such huge dreams since I was a young boy and it's  everything's laid before you've done the groundwork, you've got yourself here and it's like,  you know it's going to be like this, but it's about that process of just keeping going  and trying to say cheers through the difficult times.  But, you know, it's like anything that's difficult in life and long in life. 
[02:04:30]  It just looks really slippery near the top.  I can see it from here, I get it, I get it.  It just looks extremely just slippery.  Isn't it slippery?  Slippery.  I'm serious.  Slippery.  I always get loads of people who say, Bear, it's slippery, not slippy.  Yeah, slippery.  Slippery, yeah.  Slippery's kind of funny, though.  Slippery.  Yeah.  You could get away with that.  We'll give you that one.  Yeah, you can say whatever you want, Bear.  Yeah, yeah.  You better up where it's slippy.  You ever go up like a...  Slippery educated. 
[02:05:00]  You ever go up a frozen driveway?  I just imagine it's just like...  The whole way.  You can't even do that.  The whole way.  It's like, I'm going to save your life, bro.  Yeah?  If you've got to do it and you've got...  Just take your socks off, put your socks over your shoes,  and they'll stick like glue.  Wow.  See, I would be falling to my death.  You'd be crying.  And there's the solution again.  The garbage pail can breathe self in.  The less fun part of it is putting your socks on at the end.  Oh, I can imagine.  That's right.  Everything has a price.  That's a great tip.  It really is.  I want another tip. 
[02:05:30]  The one thing...  Sorry.  Don't eat a dodgy snake.  Dodgy snake.  Yeah, look out.  Men vs. Wild.  The one thing I never understood,  and you've done some crazy stuff,  and a lot of the stuff I can't understand,  is the bugs, how you deal with the fucking bugs.  It would drive me insane where I would just quit on the spot.  Oh, not eating them, but living with them.  No, living with the bugs.  Having them flying over your face.  Yeah, you're right.  And it's very hard to show on TV.  You don't even see mosquitoes.  Right.  You know, and sometimes, literally, again, it's like the rain. 
[02:06:00]  You can hardly hold a conversation.  It's like...  Oh!  It's like, you know...  Oh, man.  This is going to drop...  I've seen soldiers being driven mad.  I remember once on parade,  we had this parade on selection for the SAS,  and we were standing in this forestry block  in the middle of Wales in summer,  and the mosquitoes are torrential, yeah.  And we had to stand there for, like, four hours,  literally like statues.  And they said, if we see your nose so much as twitch,  you're off this course.  And we sit there, and after about 45 minutes,  I remember this guy, he's called Ginge, 
[02:06:30]  which is, like, as tough as they come,  scarred, faint nose gossip, baby.  He just suddenly broke ranks,  went running off into the bush,  just screaming,  punching himself.  That's what would get me out of the fucking woods quick,  more than anything.  You guys are Spartans.  Nobody really understood that,  because, okay, some of the worst things are the mosquitoes.  And I'm like, what do you mean, the mosquitoes?  I believe it.  We haven't been there.  Oh, man.  In Alaska, we see them as big as your thumb sometimes. 
[02:07:00]  How many bites in one night, you think?  I don't know.  Hundreds?  In some ways, one thing I'm not going to miss  of man with sweat is a mosquito bite.  But, you know, adventure runs strong  and through the blood,  so I'm looking forward to building some fun new shows  and keeping that at the heart of it,  maybe with a few less mosquitoes.  I saw a show recently,  you were talking about, I think,  where that is a guy, a man and a woman,  like a husband and wife or something.  It's Manvester Wild.  I don't even want to know the name of it.  They were on a boat.  I don't know.  It makes me mad, 
[02:07:30]  because you've been doing our show forever.  We like Bradgirl.  They do these disastrous situations.  You've got to call it,  imitations, what do they say?  Yeah, sincere form of flattery.  But you can tell they're at a campground.  These guys, you can tell.  But they were trying to be outrageous.  Right.  Because, like, they were in a boat  that was supposedly,  the motor didn't work anymore,  so they had to deal with being stranded  at sea for a while.  So they were making, like, a solar distillery  to get water out of salt water 
[02:08:00]  and things like that.  And then the guy was getting seasick,  so he was going to dehydrate  because he was vomiting.  For me, what's the problem?  Yeah, well, you know,  they had rainwater,  but they didn't want to drink the rainwater  for fear of bacteria.  So he goes,  all right, you're going to have to give me an enema.  What?  And on the boat...  Listen, that's my thing!  Isn't that he's stealing your thunder?  No.  And he, yeah, he spread eagle,  and she dumped some...  Do you know what?  Well, this is a funny story, 
[02:08:30]  because I did this on, like, season six.  So I remember hearing this amazing story  of this, you know,  bridge couple who hit...  boat got hit by a whale  in their life raft with their kids  and then run out all the water.  All they had was remains of rainwater  and turtle blood that they'd been eating off  that had gone festering  in the bottom of their raft.  And she was a nurse,  and her son went unconscious,  and the only way she kept him alive  was by giving him an enema,  rehydrating with these kind of foul fluids.  Oh, my God.  The rehydrated, but didn't make him sick, 
[02:09:00]  saved his life long enough,  and they were rescued, like,  a couple of days later.  So I knew this story,  so I tried to...  So I showed it.  But it's like the fight we had  to get it through,  discovery leaving.  Oh, really?  It's like, we're never going to be  allowed to show this.  And I said, it's great,  just kind of blur it a bit.  And I said, no, I hear that.  Well, that's funny.  But you know what?  Yeah.  Sincerest form of flattery,  even when it's going out your backside.  I guess what?  I guess the whole thing with that is  your bowels can absorb some of the...  Well, the liquid that you need  to be allowed to hydrate yourself. 
[02:09:30]  Well, if you drink it,  you're just going to get sick.  Right.  But this puts it in a part of your body  where you can still get hydrated,  but the bacteria doesn't fuck you up.  There you go.  The name of the show?  Man, Woman, Wild.  Oh, come on.  How is it legal?  Exactly.  Do you think I should be suing  for a company?  I think so.  Maybe.  It's not even close  to what you did for seven years.  Oh, there they are.  Yeah.  Not even close.  Oh, God.  I don't believe these two.  One, Biff.  They're just jungle hacks. 
[02:10:00]  Listen, I'll tell you what.  I'm the last to criticize.  They do a great job,  and we've all been on the end  of criticism, so good on that.  Oh, look at you.  There's a good guy.  He just wants to get along  with everyone.  That's weird.  There's a good guy.  That's weird to get along  with people.  Did you hear they just wrote a book?  They have a book coming out  called Mud, Sweat, and Beers.  Oh, see.  I don't know if that's okay.  Are you still over the line?  That just seems...  Okay.  That's a way over the line.  It seems a lot.  You ever fight Survivorman?  No.  You get along with him, too?  Well, I haven't met him,  but everyone always says, 
[02:10:30]  they go,  who would win in a fight?  You or Survivorman?  It's like,  ooh, probably Survivorman.  I've learned that  there's always a Survivorman  in every country.  When I go to Mexico,  they go,  who will win?  You or Jorge?  And I've just learned  to always say Jorge.  I'm going to lose one  of these fights.  Yeah, you want to fight Jorge.  Yeah, let's drown.  And as you say,  it's all testosterone.  You walk in,  it's like,  I used to have to,  on the first day  of our briefings  of Man vs. World,  before we'd drop in,  we'd get a briefing  from all these local  kind of guns,  all the search and rescue guys.  Yeah.  As they got to know the show, 
[02:11:00]  they'd all be kind of excited  to do it.  They'd have ammunition  and machetes and guns  and I'd turn up  and we'd be like,  if you take three hours  to get through  all the kind of ego  before you can actually  get the proper briefing  of what's dating.  So I learned  if I wear a little  pink sun hat,  it's quite a bit.  Oh shit, really.  They all just kind of laugh,  take the mic  and then we'd get on  with the briefing  and we'd save ourselves.  We'd have to out-macho each other.  So it became kind of my thing.  I'd just always have  the pink sun hat on day one.  We've had Survivorman in.  Les Stroud,  he's a good guy.  You guys would get along actually.  I know a lot of people  try to get something going 
[02:11:30]  between you two.  It would be,  I don't know,  your favorite cartoons  getting together.  Like the Flintstones  and the Jetsons.  Yeah, you guys should do  a little something.  A little spin-off show.  A little spin-off show.  Oh, cute.  There you go.  Man, and also  a lot of people  just going,  sounds good,  Amy Grills.  People are liking it.  Yeah, your wife and kids  won't mind if I move in, right?  No, I'm sure I'd be fine.  You guys need a  You guys need a nice  New York Jew  that's afraid  of her own shadow  living with you. 
[02:12:00]  Are your kids like you?  Like they run around  and do crazy stuff?  Are they  nearing towards that?  The kids are good for it.  I've got three boys.  They're eight, six, and three.  Well, there is a god.  Totally mad, you know.  I mean, their teacher  said to me the other day  if Marmaduke is age six  said, listen,  I need a little word  and you always think,  oh god, what are they  going to say?  She goes, it's all  well and good, Marmaduke,  knowing how to take  the doors of a helicopter  and repel out of it  age five,  but his mathematics  is really subtle.  He has a priority.  I think, could you have  a little word with him?  I'm thinking, 
[02:12:30]  I'm going, way to go.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I think it's more,  screw that math crap.  We all know  you don't need math.  You know how to repel.  I've had that for so long  and now it's kind of  getting to the stage  where they're kind of  doing badly in their exams  and I'm going, listen,  you've actually got to  do a bit of mathematics.  Yeah.  Fair enough.  It's only cute  until five  and then it's like,  get it together.  You've got to put it  in the context of,  you know,  well, when you're  navigating around  some places,  you need to know  your math.  True.  Or else you'll get lost.  The thing is,  I took them to Africa  the other day.  Oh, the other day.  And so Jesse, 
[02:13:00]  the eldest,  having never been,  you know,  to Africa before,  he was,  I came down one day  and he was like,  with all these local,  you know,  guys and,  you know,  lived on the Zambezi  all their life,  he was like,  teaching them  how to do stuff  and it was like,  the guy said,  we've called him  Dr. Livingston.  He's like,  telling them  how to survive  hippo attacks.  Swim under the water  because the hippos  can't open their mouth  under,  they won't want,  they want air  to be able to slam  down their jaws.  They go,  really?  I'm thinking,  oh no,  Jesse,  you can't stop  teaching these guys.  You know,  it's fine.  That's funny. 
[02:13:30]  So we now call him  at home,  Dr. Livingston.  Isn't it true  that hippos  kill more humans  than any other animal?  Yeah,  they're the most dangerous  dangerous animals.  I've heard that all the years.  Apart from,  of course,  the humble mosquito.  Yes.  But after mosquito,  the hippos are dangerous.  The hippos are nasty, right?  Yeah,  and aggressive,  very protective,  they're young,  you never want to get  between the water  and the hippo,  you know,  on the land.  Do you ever get close to one?  Yeah,  lots of times.  Close to having a problem,  I mean.  Yeah,  I mean,  I remember making a raft  once out of a zebra carcass 
[02:14:00]  and floating down this...  A zebra.  I've been there.  I've been there.  And I suddenly realized  I was floating down  in lunch,  basically.  These crops  are like slipping  into the water  and the hippos  going like,  no shit.  I don't remember,  that was like years  and years ago  and they went,  and they didn't even  make the show  in the end.  And they went,  oh,  the canoe looked too good.  Do you have a thing  you're scared of?  Like that one thing?  Cocktail parties.  I'm serious.  I'm such an old woman 
[02:14:30]  when it comes to cocktail parties.  Everyone's chinking glasses  in the school cocktail party,  everyone talking about nothing.  Really?  And Shara,  my wife,  goes,  look,  get over it.  You need to get over your fear.  But who's going to attempt  to talk to them  about anything?  Oh,  I bet.  No one has stories.  That makes it even worse.  But you have stories.  No one could compete  with you with stories.  I never tell stories.  I only tell stories  on things like this.  Jenny,  you kind of hang out at home.  It's like,  you know,  Shara doesn't want me  coming home and going,  get a load of this one. 
[02:15:00]  She goes,  how was it?  And I go,  it's hot.  Or,  you know,  anyway,  here are the kids  and we're back into life.  But I don't know,  cocktail parties are just like,  God,  they make my palms  for this,  I thought.  I could see that.  They do suck.  You always think  they're going to be  like maybe fun  or entertaining  and then it's just  a bore fest.  Never fun.  No,  it's fun there.  It really is.  I'm a lot of fun.  Oh,  you're a blast.  Everybody loves you.  So what happens then,  Shara,  my wife listens,  if she listens,  if she was hearing  this interview,  she'd go,  God,  you sound like  a barrel of laughs. 
[02:15:30]  Don't go out,  you know.  No,  we get it.  No one wants to  socialize with anybody  in this room.  You don't tell any stories.  Yeah,  true.  None of us socialize  in this room.  We have cool jobs  so it makes,  I don't know,  I just want to be  by myself.  I don't want to hear  about what somebody does.  I love it when I hear  that's what I'm saying.  It's so much better  than what I'm doing.  No,  because it's kind of  boring out there.  Oh,  yeah.  I'm lucky.  I have a great gig.  I know that.  Yeah.  I do know that.  You've had real jobs  in your day,  haven't you?  Well,  apart from the military, 
[02:16:00]  not really.  Really?  And then I was a climber  and leading these expeditions  and stuff.  That wasn't a real job.  Well,  there's your new show.  There's your new show,  Bear Grylls  works at the deli counter.  McDonald's.  Yeah.  That'd be great.  That'd be great.  That'd be good to go  through the drive-thru  with Bear Grylls.  Oh,  man.  I forgot my straw.  I'm kind of you  being a bit insensitive.  Oh,  sorry,  sorry,  sorry.  Bear,  you forgot my straw.  Well,  why don't you just make one?  Yeah.  Here it is.  He never just gives you  what,  you know,  you're supposed to get.  Your utensils  at the drive-thru.  Bear,  you can just use the bathroom. 
[02:16:30]  Why'd you do  the hole in the bathroom?  Bear,  what are you doing?  I fashioned utensils  out of my shoe.  All right,  Bear,  it's right there.  They're right there  next to the window.  Buy the shoe.  I love looking at pictures.  That's not funny.  I'm sorry.  I'm laughing about  something else.  No,  it's fine.  I like looking at  the pictures and books  and you meant  Prince Charles.  We're very close.  In a picture.  Is he a dud? 
[02:17:00]  He looks like he's a dud.  Is he the older one?  No,  he's the father.  Is he kind of cool?  Yeah,  he does amazing stuff.  How frustrated is he  that he's not the king yet?  What a bummer.  He's been waiting  his entire life.  I think he's pushing  70 at this point.  Okay,  here's my name drop  for the day.  I'm not going to do it.  Oh,  please.  Oh,  Amy made a sound,  right?  No,  I was looking at a picture  of you without your shirt on.  She was looking at a picture  name drop.  Please name drop.  We're shadowing.  Please name drop. 
[02:17:30]  Okay,  okay,  so yesterday I had to like  guide the queen around  all of these scouts  at Windsor Castle  and give out the  queen scout awards  for the top scouts  who've done amazing things.  Anyway,  so it was a Sunday,  so it was two days ago  and I say,  I say,  ma'am,  do you never take a day off?  You know,  and she'd been like,  been on some tour  that finished late Saturday night.  She goes,  this is my day off  You're rather ruining it.  No,  she didn't say  I was rather ruining it,  but the implication was,  look,  you've got me working  on my day off.  She's so gracious  and gives her a day  to go around. 
[02:18:00]  It's pouring rain,  torrential rain  and then she'd go,  yeah,  dawn tomorrow,  Monday morning,  I'm off on another tour  and she's 80,  what is she,  86.  She looks great.  Most people retire  at like 60,  do you know what I mean?  She's like,  30 years later,  she's still like.  Your name drop  is the queen.  Yeah,  that's a pretty good name drop.  So if Shara was here,  she'd go,  that's so good.  You're embarrassing.  You're name dropping.  You know what I love  about the story?  Two days later,  he's hanging out with us.  Yeah,  there you go.  The queen.  Boy,  what up.  The queen,  and then we were just 
[02:18:30]  talking about donkey sex.  A bit of a drop off.  Yeah,  a little drop off there.  This is great.  I don't know if we sold the book,  but it looks.  I think we did.  Mud,  sweat,  and tears.  Yeah.  Because they're saying  you've got to go.  We don't need you to go,  but if you have to go.  There's a busy man.  You love coming here,  Royce,  and thank you for plugging the book.  Number one bestseller.  And he's got mud on his face  on the back cover,  Amy.  Yeah,  that's the kind of two-faced of me.  That's like nice me.  Okay.  And that's the name.  Oh,  you're wearing blackface?  What is that?  Oh,  no,  I see.  That was after the diarrhea  on the rock face. 
[02:19:00]  That was when the camera guy  just above him  had the same problem.  Payback time.  And another picture  really quickly.  He's walking on a volcano.  Wow.  That's crazy,  man.  That's insane.  Isn't that crazy?  Well,  there have been a lot of volcanoes  over the man of Swadja.  It's always about knowing  when to pull back  and when to be able to push.  Right.  Learning that judgment.  But knowing you,  you try to get a little too close,  right?  Dude,  yeah,  you're walking on the crusty stuff  and there's lava  right underneath it.  Yeah,  that's crazy.  That's crazy.  Yeah, 
[02:19:30]  but you don't seem like  the guy that's the adrenaline junkie.  That's why I'm sweating  in that picture so much.  If you look at my neck.  Yeah.  How do you keep your shoes  from melting?  They didn't.  They did melt.  Oh,  they did?  That's why I was trying  to veer hard left.  That's what you don't.  That's what you don't melt.  Get off of there,  yeah.  Wow.  Damn,  man.  A real man.  Bear Grylls.  What the fuck?  Thank you.  Great having you here,  as usual.  It was fun.  Yeah,  the book is called  Mud,  Sweat,  and Tears,  our pal Bear Grylls.  Best seller.  We're looking forward  to see what you do next  because I know  you'll figure something out. 
[02:20:00]  Yep,  and come back  and let us know,  definitely.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks, Bear.  Take care.  Take a little break.  Yes.  Reminds,  enjoy brief.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah,  this is the  O.P. and Anthony Show.  I want to thank Bear Grylls  for stopping by.  Guy always has a story  or two to tell. 
[02:20:30]  Amy Schumer in studio.  Yeah,  the mosquito thing  would be it for me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was telling Amy,  I felt like I had to relate  to Bear Grylls  because we had a real man  in the studio.  Sure.  And I don't want her  to forget about the men  that are still in the studio.  Where?  That would be me and Anne.  Oh, yeah.  Not Sam.  Not Sam.  We all know that.  But we're still men.  You realize that?  You are men.  Okay.  Totally men.  And I was relating  by telling Amy  that when I was on vacation  in Turks and Caicos  in this beautiful room. 
[02:21:00]  Right there.  There was a mosquito  in this fucking room  in the middle of the night.  I swear to God,  I almost had a nervous breakdown.  Oh, man.  We didn't sleep.  I got up a few times  like a real man  trying to find  that little fucker.  I would lose my mind.  They know to get  right by your ears  and your face.  What is that about?  And then you're all hot  because you put  the blanket over your head.  It's the mental thing.  You actually,  like, that's how dumb we are.  We think that they're  trying to fuck with us.  Yeah.  You feel like you're like,  this fuck, fuck you.  Like, it's a fucking,  it doesn't have a brain.  It doesn't know.  It doesn't know.  But why is it going 
[02:21:30]  for the ear?  We take it personally.  You hear that thing.  Because we're not hearing  when it goes for everything else  the other times  it's not by your ear.  Is that all that is?  I'll take a mosquito  over a bed bug.  Oh, hell yeah.  I go bed bug over a mosquito.  No way.  Because at least a bed bug  you can still sleep.  Yeah.  I can't sleep thinking  there might be,  uh, that's okay.  No way.  And how much fucking blood  does a mosquito need  before it's going to  cut the shit out?  Yeah, what the fuck?  Same with bed bugs.  Seriously.  Yeah, yeah.  And I don't understand 
[02:22:00]  how the second I feel  a pinch and I smack it,  I'm like, oh good,  I got him in time.  And I'm just puffed up.  It's like I got him.  Your skin starts just blowing up.  Yeah.  What about when you're  at a beach and those,  are they the green-headed flies  or the black-headed flies?  The ones that bite you.  The ones that swarm?  They just swarm around you.  What about the ones  that bite you?  They don't even have to bite you  and they drive you nuts.  God.  See, these are just like  the man versus wild.  You guys have been through  just as much as him.  Thank you. 
[02:22:30]  Thank you.  Just as much.  He doesn't seem like,  you know,  those adrenaline junkie guys  that something else is missing  and you're like,  what are you running from?  He doesn't seem like that.  Oh, he's got something.  What, really?  We don't know what it is,  but there's something  going on there.  Something's happening?  Yes.  I don't know.  Yeah, you think he's got  one of those...  He doesn't seem like that.  He's fighting it well.  He doesn't.  He's not one of those...  You think we finally found  someone that's completely normal?  No.  I'm not completely normal.  But what is it?  No, you know what it is?  He's not the loud,  extreme guy.  Yeah. 
[02:23:00]  You know, like,  yeah, extreme!  Like, he's the quiet...  You know,  I know how to take care of myself.  I know how to take care  of a lady in the woods  if, you know,  some problem arises.  Did you know you can make  fire out of ice?  No, that's pretty fucking cool.  That's pretty cool.  I like that sock tip.  Yeah, that's a good one, too.  He's just throwing out  little survival tips.  I would be sliding  like a motherfucker.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  He knows.  Just put your socks  on the outside of your shoes, dummy.  I just want him to hold me.  Are you guys feeling like that?  Yeah, I did, too.  I did, too.  I think we all wanted him  to hold us.  In an emergency situation 
[02:23:30]  in the woods or something,  just him holding me would be...  Or watching TV.  I don't care.  Or watching TV.  I don't care.  It doesn't even have to be.  How great would it be  if there was some major problem  in this building  as we were interviewing  Bear Grylls?  And then we'd get to live  in an action-adventure movie.  Yes.  What do you think  his first move would be  to get us out of here?  Running away from you guys.  He would never help us.  No, that's part of the rules  of this fantasy.  He has to bring us.  He has to bring us with him.  All right, everybody.  Break together these mic cords. 
[02:24:00]  We're going to swing  to another floor.  You're like a dialect.  And then he would definitely  like, we'd have to put  all these together,  swing to another floor.  Nice.  Underneath the bad guys  who are coming up with guns.  Nice.  Because that's what I picture.  And then I cut my foot  and he takes off his shirt  and he uses a tourniquet.  Oh.  And then we're so scared  and we just start kissing.  You know?  Amy's fantasies  are a little different  than ours.  Oh, wait.  Are we not?  Is that enough?  I love the, you know.  You know, right?  You guys, are we with me? 
[02:24:30]  Amy's giving us  slumber party stories.  And he's like,  let's read your poetry  when you were younger.  I'm not.  I'm not.  Who's ass you think  we'd have to eat  to survive?  Oh, Jesus.  He would want to keep you alive  because you're eye candy  so you're safe.  You gotta be around.  Oh, all right.  Who's ass?  I think I...  We're in this building  for days.  We're gonna have to go there.  We're gonna have to go there.  Dude, I'm an expert  at firearms  so I have to live too.  Oh, no.  What do you have?  I have to live.  What you got? 
[02:25:00]  What's your skill?  My smile.  You do have a nice smile.  It's very warm.  It's a warming smile.  Your guileless smile?  My guileless smile  and my blue eyes  I hope would be enough.  Piercing blue eyes?  I hope that would be enough.  I've seen those peepers  for a while.  That's true.  Sam, what would you  have to offer to this?  Sam?  If you don't have  something to offer  then you're the food.  Well, I have youth  on my side.  Oh, boy.  Rub that in.  Even Bear Grylls  I think would look at that.  Yeah, Bear Grylls  don't give a shit.  Yeah, he doesn't care.  I'm wiry.  I can slide... 
[02:25:30]  Look at how thin  my wrists are.  He does a thin wrist.  You might be too thin to eat.  That might be your...  That might just be it for you.  And I can slide into...  E-Rock.  E-Rock's...  Oh, boy.  E-Rock.  You're so fucked.  He's dead.  I'll slit his throat  the second  if there's even a fire  if there's a fire drill.  Slit his throat.  That'd be great.  So our first move  is to slit E-Rock's throat  and hang him from the ceiling  so he bleeds out.  Yeah.  That sounds like  a good way to start.  There we go.  Weeks.  That'll be fine.  That's before we even know  there's really a problem.  Yeah, they're just like  that was just a drill. 
[02:26:00]  We're like,  well, we won't take any chances.  You know what?  We killed E-Rock.  We got barbecue.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  That is good, though.  We could, you know,  we could camp out.  He knows all the survival shit.  Mm-hmm.  I got, you know,  just in case the bad guys come in,  I got some good firearms training.  Yeah.  I almost sacrificed my phone.  I want to see  how he started the fire with the phone.  Oh, it's shortening out the battery.  He did not trust us.  Yeah, but do you know how to do that?  I don't know technically how to do it,  but I know shorting out the battery  I could make a fucking phone go on fire.  But how would you do it? 
[02:26:30]  You take the battery out of any phone.  Yeah.  You'd have to crack open your iPhone,  but you could do that.  It's just glass.  And then you take the battery out,  you connect the positive and negative contacts,  and the whole battery  is going to fucking short out on you.  And it's very hot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or you could probably take a thin wire  if you have it.  If you could strip a piece of wire in the phone,  very thin piece of wire,  and it will heat up and turn red hot.  And if you have some type of wool,  that kind of fire wool.  So you could probably start a fire. 
[02:27:00]  I could probably start a fire.  But I also have this like magnesium thing and stuff  to start a fire with.  Oh, my God.  Why don't we show him your survival bag?  You're like hatchet.  Oh, yeah.  I'm crazy.  He's got a survival bag.  This can start a fire very easily.  It sounds like a harmonica.  And I have a satellite phone, too,  just in case.  Wow, you're ready.  Because if communications go down,  I want to be the guy that's actually calling  for nobody to pick up  because communications are down.  I can only call other satellite phones.  You're going to be a crazy old guy.  Oh, going to be?  When you get elderly, 
[02:27:30]  you're going to be nuts.  You're going to have a fallout shelter.  I am batshit crazy when it comes to that stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  I got like a go bag.  Why don't you do what everyone else is going to do  and just die?  Why do you have to be the guy?  I think I'll just...  I don't want to be around.  We have to have somebody that...  Why are you going to be the guy?  Are you going to start a new population?  No, not at all.  I just want to kill zombies and stuff.  And you're stuck on Long Island.  That's the hardest place to get off.  Oh, please.  There's boats.  You know they have these zombie things,  like these zombie runs 
[02:28:00]  where everybody acts like it's the apocalypse?  Yes.  Would you ever do that?  No.  No?  What do they do?  They just pretend?  I'm waiting for either zombie attack  or race war.  One of the two.  Something's got to kick up.  What do you think is first?  Zombie attack or race war?  I'm not sure,  but it all depends on certain verdicts.  I'm hoping for race war.  Yeah, I think race war.  Although you never know.  People are like,  well, zombies aren't real.  You're like,  well, you know what?  With some of the experimentation going on  and mad cow disease  and things like that,  it doesn't have to be technically 
[02:28:30]  rising from the dead zombies.  It could be disease zombies.  Can we ask Bear Grylls  what his first move would be  if this building was under attack?  Under attack.  Or he might be too busy.  Also, see what he's doing for dinner.  Hilarious.  All right, let me just...  Oh, God.  Oh, he's giving him the...  I wish his entourage was like,  you know...  Just all guys that are crazy.  Yeah, I know you're busy, but...  Whenever you walk into a building,  you've got to always be looking out  for the exit signs and the stairway. 
[02:29:00]  So you always have a contingency.  One of the jobs to do  is head out to the scouts.  What's the scout motto?  Yeah.  What?  Boxers or briefs?  No, Amy.  Oh, Amy.  I'm sorry.  That's not the scout motto.  I'm sorry, you guys.  I'm sorry.  Be prepared.  Be prepared.  He's teaching us.  I didn't think that was out loud.  I did not think that was out loud.  That is my...  He's teaching us.  That is my bad.  I take full responsibility.  Amy, he's such a girl.  Amy's killing the name of her.  I really...  I apologize.  Amy, we should get a plug in because...  And I think maybe we'll take another break 
[02:29:30]  before this Warren...  Some guy named Warren.  Warren Littlefield.  Some guy.  Hello.  I don't really know.  Have you ever heard  Third Rock from the Sun?  No.  How about Third Rock from the Sun?  Yes.  No.  Maybe a tiny little show.  E.R.  Hello.  Hello, Seinfeld.  Hello, Seinfeld.  Yes.  Perhaps a cheers.  Do you know about...  I don't know why we waste the time  with this guy.  Family ties.  Family ties.  We are going in order of importance.  What has he done lately? 
[02:30:00]  I like talking to the guys  that have something going on now.  Dharma and Greg.  Here's something that's going on now.  I'll be at the Riviera in Las Vegas.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The 11th through the 13th  and the Stress Factory.  17th, 18th.  Nice.  Yeah.  Amy Schumer.  Very funny.  I know we can help you out  with the Stress Factory for sure.  I don't know how many fans  we got in the Vegas area.  I know we have some.  I think we got a few.  But I mean, Stress Factory,  let's just sell it out for Amy Schumer.  That would be great.  That would be awesome.  Show up.  Show up.  Damn you.  You won't be disappointed.  I promise you.  Show up.  Show up.  Fuckers. 
[02:30:30]  All right.  We'll do another thing to say to you.  No, that's not.  Oh, shit.  I thought.  Yeah, you're threatening them.  All right.  Sorry.  Where were we?  In the studio here.  Zombies.  Look around.  You okay?  Oh, zombies?  Yeah, I'm okay.  I really didn't know where I was yesterday  because I, like Girls Daily,  had a tit picture.  I saw.  I saw that tit picture.  Yeah, that was a good one.  I was like,  I can't believe I'm not following you.  That was a good one.  The first picture was that girl's,  are those real, you think?  Yeah, she had youth on her side.  Oh, good.  I forgot where I was.  Those nipples were pointing north.  They really were.  Hey, they were really lovely. 
[02:31:00]  Look, I'm not, don't get bad.  I mean, I'm just saying.  Well, are you at this point?  No, they were great.  Okay, all right.  They were great.  Tits should not start violence like this.  Everyone gets happy with them.  I hope she's a stone butch.  We could really do some work together.  Yes, yeah, we learned about stone butches today.  And you could just lay back and relax.  Just chill out.  Enjoy your life.  We're going to have to work now.  You realize that,  because we were talking about zombies and blacks.  Do you realize any day,  aliens could just fucking take over this place?  Really?  Yeah.  I stay awake sometimes.  You think about that? 
[02:31:30]  Like, what if they just decided  we have nothing to do?  Today could be the day  where the aliens go,  yeah, it's our plan.  It's time, let's go.  Like illegal aliens?  Let's rock.  They've already attacked  and we're paying the price dearly.  Do we have any chance against aliens?  Yeah.  The Avengers?  Oh, the Avengers?  The Avengers take on aliens?  That's what happens.  Yep.  Oh, wow.  So we're straight.  I'm thinking there aren't any Avengers, Sam.  There's just people.  We know there's no superheroes  because they're certainly not coming on our show.  No.  No.  Amy, we got the Avengers coming out Friday, right? 
[02:32:00]  Huge movie.  You would think we'd have a few superheroes.  We've had two interviews  that have something to do with that movie.  No superheroes.  No superheroes.  Super villain.  Who cares?  We want the superhero.  We want superheroes.  And ScarJo.  And ScarJo.  ScarJo.  ScarJo Hanson's in it.  We never got her.  Oh, come on.  No.  You know how quickly you would be escorted out of the studio of ScarJo?  Oh, my God.  You would just murder me and throw me under the table.  Amy who?  Amy Hoomer.  Guys, you said we were friends, you guys.  Yeah. 
[02:32:30]  We would be stepping on your head so you don't make any noises.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You'd be so gone.  The loyalty is overwhelming.  It's ScarJo Hanson.  We think you're hot and all, but let's be honest.  It's ScarJo Hanson.  If ScarJo started walking down that hall, you'd be...  Got to be honest.  Kenny would break your neck and throw you out the window.  You think I wouldn't murder you guys for Bear Grylls just to go out for coffee with me?  Oh, yeah.  Okay, well...  Do you know how good you'd look sitting there with Bear Grylls with some coffee?  His accent.  What would be your move?  What would be your move?  Just chatting.  You and Bear Grylls.  I'd just give him a sweet handy under the table.  Oh, man.  I mean, does that still work? 
[02:33:00]  Is that still what people are doing now?  I think it's called No Harm, No Foul.  That's it.  It's like King of Comedy.  Oh, my God.  What's her name?  When she's like, you know, I could carry your clubs.  Hey, you want a driver, Jer?  Oh, Sarah Bernhardt.  You need your putter, Jer?  Yeah.  She was great in that movie.  Yeah, Sandra Bernhardt.  What a great movie.  Fuck.  I love that fucking movie.  Let's just talk about a movie now.  King of Comedy is so goddamn good.  Oh, it's so good.  De Niro was amazing in that one.  And Jerry Lewis just played himself.  Jerry Lewis played himself.  He was a prick.  He stinks.  He's a prick.  So was Hitler. 
[02:33:30]  All right.  I see movement down the hall.  So why don't we take a break and...  Warren Littlefield next.  Some guy named Warren Littlefield.  Very big in the industry.  He's made, like, every TV show.  Yes, everything.  Perhaps I'd mention a little show.  Perhaps.  I think we named them all.  A little show.  A little thing I'd like to call Frasier.  Frasier.  Really?  Yeah.  Off of Cheers.  Does this sound ring about...  Dun, dun.  It should.  Creator of Law and Order.  Law and Order.  What?  How about that?  Yes.  Did he write these shows? 
[02:34:00]  No.  Or is he just behind the desk?  He has money.  He's the guy that went, that sounds good.  Let's put that on.  He was behind the desk.  Genius.  Yeah.  Yeah, but all these shows.  Smart.  Come on.  Smart man.  That's the programming guy.  The guy that decides if these shows go or no go.  The Cosby Show.  Development executive.  Yeah.  The Cosby Show, which is not on the cover.  Whoa.  Everybody looks very white.  Yeah.  Except for the one ER guy.  Well, they do want to...  It is on a book.  Yeah, they do want it to be readers.  You've got to cater to.  So that's like Scott Greenstein taking credit for us. 
[02:34:30]  Exactly.  Oh, fuck.  Well, let's cancel the war on Littlefield.  Oh, he's right there.  Please, Sam.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Whether or not you're paying attention is another question.  Opie, you see who's outside?  Man, I'm eating.  We've got to be like professionals.  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  Maybe we get discovered today. 
[02:35:00]  I miss Bear.  Oh, you miss Bear already?  I miss him.  What do you think he's thinking about?  Warren will take the place.  You.  Amy Schumer.  He is, right?  Amy Schumer.  Amy Schumer.  I'm sorry.  Amy Schumer.  I'm sorry.  I had a great...  Because he's looking like he really needs to get in here.  Yeah.  You had a great observation.  He was walking down the hall and you're like, that guy is the guy that always fires us.  He's so right.  He's everybody.  All those higher up execs that always fired us.  He looks rich.  He does look rich, Amy.  We don't.  No.  We look poor as dirt and desperate.  We don't look like we're rich. 
[02:35:30]  He's debating if he wants to come in on that.  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  Come on in.  The great...  Come on in, Mr. Littlefield.  There he is.  The great Warren Littlefield.  Hi.  Anthony, Opie.  Hi, Warren.  How are you, brother?  There's Amy Schumer.  All right.  And Amy Schumer.  Amy Schumer.  Stand-up comic extraordinaire and very pretty girl.  Oh.  As a matter of fact.  Hi, Warren.  Amy Schumer.  Please tell people.  You know, Warren, Anthony brought up something that we want to discuss with you.  Oh, really?  You could just pull that mic up.  We're actually on the air.  We just throw ourselves right on. 
[02:36:00]  Is this headphones?  Yeah, I like that.  Where are ours?  I took your headphones.  There are the headphones.  My goodness.  I'm sorry about that.  Don't worry about the lights.  I don't have anything you can contract.  You don't need to put them on if you don't want to.  You can't contract anything from my ears.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  Yeah, you don't need them.  You can hear us.  I'm with the badasses of XM.  Well, we've slowed down a little with age.  We want to know, because you wrote this fine book, if you wrote about the XFL pregame show.  Oh, Jesus.  Because we did some work with NBC. 
[02:36:30]  We did our stint at NBC.  You were looking at NBC employees.  We absolutely got a paycheck from that.  I walked into 30 Rock a couple of times.  A few times.  At least two times.  And how was that?  How did that feel?  It felt amazing.  It did.  It really did.  I felt part of the NBC family from growing up as a kid and watching the following broadcast,  the broadcast, Living Color on NBC with a peacock and everything.  And then walking in, I was like, finally.  And then, you know, after a few days getting booted.  Well, it might have lasted six weeks.  Oh, it was six weeks.  And we knew it was over when the same guy that loved us didn't even say hi to us in the elevator. 
[02:37:00]  In the elevator.  And we were.  That's a sign.  That's a sign, right?  That's a sign.  And we were officially still working for NBC.  More strippers.  They needed more strippers.  That's what it was.  The NFL, great idea, ahead of its time.  Right?  Revolutionary.  Now, what did you think, Warren, when you heard about Vince McMahon wanting to break into  football and NBC was going to be taking care of this?  Yeah, I kept thinking, well, they do have this league called the NFL.  Yes. 
[02:37:30]  Right.  A little league.  Maybe you heard of it.  Badasses, right?  Right.  And, you know, you usually attack when you see weakness.  Mm-hmm.  Fox did that.  With the Simpsons, when the Cosby show was getting old.  Mm-hmm.  We were vulnerable.  They accelerated our decline.  So, a good business law.  Attack when you see weakness, right?  Mm, NFL.  Not so weak.  Right.  Going pretty strong.  Going strong. 
[02:38:00]  And I think they're going to make it.  Yeah, yeah.  I think they're over the hump.  They're over the hump.  I think they're going to make it.  So, you know what?  I don't blame you.  Thank you.  I think Vince McMahon does.  I think America does.  Yeah.  We did it.  Thank you.  Because we really thought it was going to lead to other things.  Oh, God.  I think it's been 10 years.  10 years later.  Yeah, 10 years later, we're waiting.  I even knew.  We put in our time.  Yeah.  But you're still here.  Yes.  Oh, God.  Are we?  Save us.  Not so much there.  I feel like you have one more sitcom in you. 
[02:38:30]  Save us.  You're looking at two guys that can make things happen.  Oh, what a wacky comedy.  And Leney, she could be in there.  I'll be the wacky neighbor.  Please.  Let's do this.  I think we move you front and center.  Yes.  Okay.  I like where you're going.  Well, talent and appeal.  Appeal.  Thank you.  She does have a appeal.  Wait, did you look at Ant when you said appeal?  No, no, no.  Was he the appeal?  No, I'm the appeal.  I'm kind of putting Opie and Anthony together in the same frame.  Yeah.  And I'm looking at you.  Wow.  There we go.  There we go.  It's like being in a meeting. 
[02:39:00]  The vision on this guy.  I thought we'd show Warren Littlefield the door.  No.  No.  How about you?  Warren Littlefield.  The visionary.  He has Top of the Rock.  Yes.  It's inside the rise and fall of must-see TV.  Now, rise and fall.  This is interesting because there was a huge rise.  Now, you consider NBC to be what now?  Not what it used to be.  Not what it was.  But what is?  I mean, the world changed.  Yes.  This book celebrates a decade where a third of the country, 75 million Americans, would 
[02:39:30]  come and watch must-see TV.  Thursday night.  It was a shared experience.  Yeah.  And if you weren't part of the conversation, you didn't show up for work on Friday.  You don't go to the water cooler.  You don't go and get your coffee on Friday if you didn't watch on Thursday night.  And look, I think the country wants and needs a collective television experience, and we 
[02:40:00]  were able to give it to them.  I miss that shared experience.  You're absolutely right.  It's very fractured, fragmented now.  It's so all over the place.  It's on demand.  Don't you change the world, right?  Yeah.  So there was great TV before must-see TV.  There's great TV now.  But there are over 200 channel choices.  Yeah.  Okay?  Yeah.  So everybody has a little piece, you know, from cable, some on network.  It's all over, and everybody finds their own show. 
[02:40:30]  And that collective experience that you waited for Friday morning to share with your coworkers,  that's now instantly Twittering, blogs, any social networking site.  Damn spoilers.  And those are those little moments that go out there for that shared experience, and it's  instantaneous.  Yeah.  It's just different.  Did you see it coming?  Did you see technology coming and changing television so much?  Well, I think what we realized was we may not be able to stay at this height forever. 
[02:41:00]  You know, Peyton Manning reminded us pretty recently, nothing lasts forever.  Right.  And the must-see TV experience was sensational.  So it was wonderful.  So you're saying Peyton Manning's going to be a bust with the Broncos.  No, no.  But Peyton looked out to the world, and as he said thank you, you know, for his run,  he also acknowledged that nothing lasts forever, and I think that's the case. 
[02:41:30]  Look, NBC, they have some good shows on Thursday night right now.  What they need is Modern Family.  They need that draft pick to put right in the middle of Thursday night.  Cheers was the lowest-rated comedy in all of network television at the end of its first year.  It was an amazing story, the Cheers.  Well, it was at the bottom of the heap.  Yeah.  So who do we have to thank for Cheers? 
[02:42:00]  We thank Bill Cosby.  Bill Cosby comes in to Thursday night on NBC, brings 34 million viewers the first night he's on,  and we shout to that audience, stick around for Cheers, stick around, it's really good.  And there was a quality adult audience.  They had no reason to come to NBC.  Our programming was crap.  And Bill created this tidal wave, and then we had a great show that was sitting there where, for the next 10 years, 
[02:42:30]  Cheers becomes the absolute tentpole to Thursday night.  So, you know, you need those drivers into the game.  Now, when you saw, after the first season, that Cheers was at the bottom, what was the scuttlebutt around the executives?  Were you thinking of shelving it?  We loved it, but clearly America didn't. 
[02:43:00]  America hadn't embraced it.  And Brandon Tartikoff and I had a conversation with Grant Tinker, and he asked us a simple question.  Do you have anything better?  Oh, wow.  Good question.  Great, right?  And the answer was no.  And he said, well, I think you just answered whether or not it's coming back.  Wow.  But didn't the same thing happen to Seinfeld?  It's like, you used to be able to give a show a couple seasons.  I feel like they don't do that anymore. 
[02:43:30]  Absolutely.  The Seinfeld story is, it's historical.  The research on the Seinfeld pilot was, in a word, disastrous.  They knew who Jerry Seinfeld was, the research audience.  They just thought it was a really lousy show.  And his friends, absolutely wimpy, whiny people.  Unlikable.  Self-centered.  And selfish. 
[02:44:00]  And neurotic.  Like people.  And so, what they also said was, well, Jerry Seinfeld's stand-up, you know, that's not bad.  Just do that.  Of course.  Right, right.  We did the opposite.  Oh, boy.  So, after, it screened pretty well, by the way.  It screened pretty well when we did our management screenings, and we were scared to death off  the research.  Wow, I bet.  So, we picked up two shows.  Tell me if you've ever heard of these. 
[02:44:30]  The Nuthouse.  Oh, boy.  And Sister Kate.  Oh, Sister Kate.  What a classic.  No.  Yeah, they just didn't.  The Nuthouse.  Yeah.  They didn't last.  Who was in that show, The Nuthouse?  The Nuthouse.  Who was the big star?  Cloris Leachman and Harvey Korman.  Wow.  Well, let's get that back on the air.  Cloris is still out.  Yeah, she's funny.  They're very funny people.  You're kind of skewing a little older than that.  True.  Even then.  Yeah, even then. 
[02:45:00]  Even then.  Yeah, right.  Cloris Leachman turned 86 yesterday.  True.  God bless her.  She was in here.  She is nuts.  She was in here?  She was playing with Sam's hair the whole time.  She is nuts.  She's completely there, by the way.  She is nuts.  But she's bad.  The show wasn't.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So we took a deep breath.  We spent all our money.  And we had to figure out, okay, are we going to let Seinfeld go away?  Hmm.  So I had a late night meeting with a finance guy.  And he goes, Hugh spent all the money.  And I'm like, we always have extra money somewhere. 
[02:45:30]  And it was developed from the variety and specials department.  So he said, well, you know, you could bail on one of your variety specials.  So I looked at a Bob Hope two-hour special budget.  And we bailed on Bob.  And I called up Jerry and I said, I've got great news.  We have four episodes of Seinfeld that we're going to make.  Dead silence. 
[02:46:00]  And Jerry goes, okay, so I just have one question.  In the history of television, has there ever been a successful show launched off of an episode order of four?  That's a fair question.  And then it was my turn to be quiet.  And I went, I don't know, Jerry.  I actually don't know the answer to that.  And he said, okay, okay, we'll make them.  And Jerry and Larry were convinced that we would never put them on the air. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  That they would hold a dinner party at some point in the future.  And after a wonderful meal and some good wine, they would say to their close friends, here are the episodes that NBC never aired.  And they made them for themselves and for their friends.  How would they entertain them?  We had one note after the pilot, add a girl.  And Julia Louis-Dreyfus was added to the show after the pilot. 
[02:47:00]  But it was a slow start.  I mean, we finally got up to 13 episodes.  But how did they survive the four?  Because I assume the ratings weren't.  The ratings were okay, but we put it on in the summer, behind Cheers, and the ratings didn't suck.  There was a fall off, Seinfeld original, everything else was a sea of reruns.  It was in June.  Okay, yeah, yeah.  And the interesting thing, it's men.  Young adult men went, I get these guys. 
[02:47:30]  These guys are as fucked up as we are.  So that kind of went, hmm, all right.  And we laughed.  We said, this is funny.  And we didn't know if it would work, but we couldn't let it go.  How accurate a depiction was your character in that during the pilot episode?  Yeah, Bob Balaban was great in that.  Yeah, Bob Balaban.  Pretty accurate.  Yeah.  Oh, my God. 
[02:48:00]  That's got to be weird.  It wasn't a refined pitch.  The pitch, yeah.  Jerry was like, first of all, Jerry's agent, George Shapiro, his manager, said, what about Jerry?  And we were like, okay, what about Jerry?  What would the show be?  Stuff.  Yeah.  Things.  And it was a celebration of a sensibility of Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld. 
[02:48:30]  How they talk, how they relate to the world.  And we kind of scratched our head and went, yeah, I guess maybe it's funny.  I don't know.  It didn't cost that much to develop a piece of material.  There wasn't a huge holding deal for Jerry.  And you didn't have anything better.  Nothing better in your back pocket.  And we were like, all right, let's take a shot.  But once they started making episodes, we were like, we can't let this go. 
[02:49:00]  So then we put it on in a regular time slot.  And it's Wednesday nights at 9, up against Home Improvement.  Oh, man.  They kicked our ass.  But they were making, the Seinfeld episodes were really memorably funny.  Oh, yeah.  They're all classic.  Very original show.  Yeah, and they are all amazingly funny and classic.  And look, we scratched our head.  And I said, well, don't you need a little more story here? 
[02:49:30]  I mean, this is basically, you're looking for your car in a parking garage.  Awesome.  Does anything else happen?  Chinese restaurant?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, we thought, should we shut it down?  Because read the script, went to the run-through.  All they do is wait for a table?  Yeah.  That's amazing.  I think most people wouldn't have enough patience to sit through all that.  Yeah.  They would have to move on.  Yeah.  But for whatever reason, you guys did it.  And the rest is history, as they say. 
[02:50:00]  For some reason, we thought this sensibility, it cracked us up.  Right.  And we stopped thinking about the audience as though they were some alien strangers out there.  We started to just say, hey, you know what?  Maybe the audience is us.  We were, you know, young adults working at the network and said, well, if we want to run people over on the freeway to get to our sets to watch it, maybe the people out there will want to do the same thing. 
[02:50:30]  And it was that belief.  And ultimately, when Cheers, after an 11-year run, steps away, when Ted Danson says, you know what?  It's time for me to be Ted.  I've been Sam for a long time.  I can't argue with that, although I was now the guy in charge.  It was my only top 10 rated show.  And, yeah, I was ready to jump off the plate. 
[02:51:00]  Because Cheers wasn't ready to go.  Some of these shows, you could tell, they get a little tired or old, and you could see it.  It's time.  But I don't remember Cheers having that drop off at all.  I think you're right.  Cheers was still absolutely humming along.  It was great.  And I couldn't argue with Ted.  He picked up the phone and said, I want you to know this is what I'm doing.  And so I could see.  So you were losing your big gun there, yeah.  I was losing my big gun.  And I could see that the exit door was getting larger and larger for me. 
[02:51:30]  And lo and behold, that Seinfeld show that we had played with and held on to and got its  ass kicked by Home Improvement, we said, okay, this is it.  This is our future.  So we're going to put Seinfeld behind Cheers.  And as Cheers had their victory lap to say goodbye, Seinfeld eclipsed it and went into the time period and had nearly a decade where they just lit it up and became the tentpole, just as Cheers had been, for Thursday night. 
[02:52:00]  So that was incredible.  Patience was rewarded.  What show did you put after Seinfeld?  I'm trying to remember to build that one up.  Well, so Cheers was like out the door.  Right.  And again, I'm thinking, I got to have something.  You know, what comes out of the greatness of Cheers? 
[02:52:30]  And we looked at the Frasier Crane character and said, Kelsey, you know, Kelsey can do this.  Kelsey and the creators wanted to do a show.  They didn't want anything to do with the Frasier Crane character.  They wanted Kelsey to be a Ted Turner-like business magnate who had some illness and would never for the life of the series get out of his bed.  And he would conduct his empire from his bedside. 
[02:53:00]  And that was their plan.  That sounds like my dad.  Very difficult.  Yeah.  So God bless him.  A guy named John Pike was running Paramount Television and said, you know, that's a brilliant idea, guys.  I think we're going to hold that.  And we're going to go back and first give them a hit show.  And we're all going to make a lot of money.  And that's going to be based on the Frasier character. 
[02:53:30]  I don't even have to.  We've heard that so many times over the years.  Obviously, a lower level.  Executive speak.  That executive stuff.  You guys are brilliant.  That's a great idea.  Yeah.  That's good.  We're going to put this aside.  But we want to do another take where you guys just do the lines that are written.  We'll do one for safety.  That means the one you're going to use.  Yeah, that's the one.  Stuff that we found hilarious.  Yeah.  All right.  How long was your tenure over there at NBC?  I spent 20 years at NBC.  And for nine years, I ran the entertainment division. 
[02:54:00]  So basically for the 90s, I ran the entertainment division.  What were you doing before that at NBC?  I started in comedy development when the comedy lineup at NBC was Different Strokes and Hello, Larry.  Hello, Larry.  Okay?  Yeah.  Different Strokes was one of those shows that was a hit right from the start, wasn't it?  Like, I remember we were deluged with promotions for it before it was on.  I mean, you just saw a lot of the Gary Coleman lines. 
[02:54:30]  Gary Coleman was brilliant.  Gary Coleman would come to a table reading, and the rest of the cast hadn't read the script.  Gary Coleman had it memorized at the table at the start of the production week.  He was amazing, and it was a great character.  But CBS had a dozen high-quality, great comedies.  MASH, All in the Family, Carol Burnett.  And ABC had 14 comedies on their schedule. 
[02:55:00]  They had Happy Days, Laverne and Shirley, Barney Miller, Taxi.  They had everything, right?  You forget about that.  And we had Different Strokes and Hello, Larry.  So, Facts of Life was in production, and that's when I came in.  And I came in as the junior kid in comedy development.  God, you're rich.  Yeah.  That's what I'm thinking.  Yeah, what a ride.  You came in at that point and turned it into what it is? 
[02:55:30]  You are so rich.  This guy is rich.  You know every episode.  Oh, the episode where, you know, it's like these classic, you totally changed our culture.  What about now?  The shows, honestly, what comedies do you, like, enjoy?  Would you watch now that are on?  Well, getting my dose of Larry David's sensibility.  Curb your enthusiasm.  You have to look at last season.  I was on.  Hello.  Thank you.  Oh, Amy was on.  It was a huge deal.  It was a really big deal. 
[02:56:00]  Yes.  It was a great deal.  What other?  How wonderful.  Last year, going to New York, battling Michael J. Fox over his combat boots, making too much noise.  That was wonderful.  I think Modern Family is outstanding.  You know, that's what NBC needs today.  If they had Modern Family, you know, in a magical makeup world, if they had Modern Family Thursday at 9, you know, then it would be drawing in the same way Bill brought people to cheers. 
[02:56:30]  You know, they just don't have that big mainstream monster head.  You know, and what was interesting to us with Friends is that, okay, it's a show about 20-somethings in New York, and it was a target that I was really interested in.  I had developed some really bad material going against that target. 
[02:57:00]  Really horrible stuff.  But Marta Kaufman and David Crane said, this is our life.  This is our story.  They completely owned it.  They kicked ass in the pitch.  And I just jumped up and said, finally, at last.  And so we had to step up to a pilot commitment.  Okay, that's fine.  You know, what it really meant was if we hated the material, it would cost us about a quarter of a million dollars to get out of it.  But we loved it.  And it sent the signal out to the casting world. 
[02:57:30]  There was this absolute buzz.  And our belief was, and I really felt, television makes stars.  Television can take someone who no one's ever heard of and really make them a household name.  And, of course, that's what we were able to accomplish with friends.  And the strange thing is they were writing about such universal experiences. 
[02:58:00]  First time out on your own.  First job.  First crush.  First big disappointment.  All those things in life.  We were a season into the show.  And a quarter of the audience was over 50 for that show.  Wow.  And it was like, why is that?  Why?  And I realized we were all young once.  But you do.  Right.  And those experiences were universal.  I only have one problem with that show.  You do realize they wouldn't have been able to afford that apartment. 
[02:58:30]  I know that the New York show bothers me.  Because everything you said I related to.  But when I first moved to New York, I didn't have a place like that.  That's nice.  It's right.  Central Perk.  I've had homeless people.  Yeah.  My first apartment was infested with cockroaches and mice.  I'm still living in an apartment infested with cockroaches.  I'm still itching from my first apartment.  Whatever the hell was in there.  Are you a New York guy?  I grew up in Jersey.  Oh, okay.  You know, but I did live off of Hudson for a while, below 14th.  And I understand where you're coming from. 
[02:59:00]  We call what we did aspirational.  Ah, very nice.  One of these days kind of a thing.  They have an answer for anything, these guys.  Oh, yes, certainly do.  What a good word.  They certainly do.  Good key word.  What a blast, man.  What was the last must-see TV show with your run?  For me, for my run, Will and Grace.  Will and Grace was it for you?  Yeah.  Great show.  That's a hell of a run.  What was the show that came on after that?  Beats Me, I left.  You really don't know?  You jumped ship.  Oh, you mean, well, Will and Grace, we initially put on Monday night, and then they moved it 
[02:59:30]  appropriately.  The design was always, it was a must-see Thursday show.  And Will and Grace went on to Thursday night and continued to carry the torch.  But that's one where gay guy, straight girl, best friends, my management said, what are  you doing?  Like, what, are you crazy?  No advertiser is going to go in that show. 
[03:00:00]  Don't you feel like just saying occasionally, just, hey, look at my track record and shut  up and let me do this.  Yeah, what have you done with your life?  Yeah.  Well, that's kind of what I said.  Good for you.  You know, I was a little sneaky about it.  First of all, I made a deal in-house, so we owned the show at NBC, and then I made a deal  with the writers.  And so they were even more concerned because, like, all right, this is our asset.  And I said, you know, it's a script.  It's an idea that had been percolating for me 10 years prior to the development of that. 
[03:00:30]  But I went in and pitched it to my boss, and they said, the fuck out of here.  And I think he was right.  They probably weren't ready for it.  But, you know, Ellen had come out, and that was the end of her show.  She was kind of a trailblazer.  And I just looked at the world around us, and I said, well, I know this relationship.  I see it everywhere. 
[03:01:00]  I see that best friend's relationship.  We're the network that has, we've made a living off of young adults and kind of reflecting  the world that we live in here.  Why not?  And, by the way, it's a script.  Most scripts suck, and we never make them.  But ultimately, it was a good script.  And then I went and got Jimmy Burroughs, and no one argues with Jimmy Burroughs. 
[03:01:30]  Jimmy Burroughs executive produced, co-created, and directed almost every episode of Cheers.  He did the pilot of Friends.  He did Night Court.  He has put 57 series, not pilots, series on the air.  You don't fuck with Burroughs.  Correct.  So, once I had Burroughs, I was like, hey, you know, it's a pilot.  It's just a pilot.  You know, most pilots suck.  So, that's all.  You know, we just, we'll try it. 
[03:02:00]  And when we screened Will & Grace for management, Bob Wright was a CEO of NBC.  Lights came up, and everyone enjoyed it, but I was close to it, and I had fought for this  thing.  Lights came up, and Bob Wright said, it's the best thing we've ever had our name on.  Wow.  Game over.  Done, yeah, yeah.  That was going on the air.  And so, I'm really, I'm proud of that.  I'm proud of the battles that I fought for that one.  My final battle was West Wing. 
[03:02:30]  I had developed that, and I had a boss that said, you know, no.  Really?  Because she had a black boyfriend?  Amy.  So, that was kind of like my final battle, and then I was gone.  Yeah.  It seems like the timing, the timing has to be so sensitive, like, Will & Grace, you have  to do it when people aren't really ready for it.  If people are too comfortable, then it's, like, already over. 
[03:03:00]  I think you're absolutely right.  That's a great observation.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you.  You've got her sitting up straight now.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you.  Now, we see why she's here.  See?  That's it.  This is the brains of the operation.  That's me, you guys.  Yes.  I've been calling myself that for years.  It's nice to hear it from someone else.  That's appropriate.  Yeah, we could talk to you all day, but they're saying you have to leave.  Oh, my gosh.  We do, too, as a matter of fact.  Really?  Yeah.  That stinks.  I know.  Well, I want to read this book.  Will you sign it for us?  Top of the rock.  I will absolutely sign it, and, you know, if you love the content, it's a celebration of 
[03:03:30]  that content.  Yeah.  It's a little touch of nostalgia in there.  What do you do after you leave?  Just remember all these shows.  You left NBC.  Did you just chill out, or did you continue doing all the things?  Do you live on a houseboat?  I, right now, have a production company, and I'm in a non-exclusive deal with ABC Studios,  so I play in the world of scripted television, and I develop hours, half hours.  My last show was on ABC, called My Generation, was on for two episodes, and then they said 
[03:04:00]  it was on Thursday night at 8 o'clock, Big Bang Theory came in, boom, and it was the  Big Bang for us.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  I was proud of it.  It was not in the right time period, and so it didn't last too long.  Back to the drawing board.  I'm not a fan of Big Bang Theory.  Me neither.  I'm team Warren Littlefield.  I auditioned to play that bitch.  Really?  Yeah.  But I don't, that show doesn't speak to me.  Well, very few do, don't you think?  Let's just say it's hard for me to watch. 
[03:04:30]  There you go.  You know, like nerd speak?  There you go.  Yeah, I didn't get into that one.  But I'm happy comedies in general are coming back finally.  I felt like there was a, how many years, you think, Ant?  Like a five, six year period.  I wouldn't watch any of those sitcoms.  No.  It was the same formula that, you know, started with obviously a lot of the shows you were  involved with, but then they were doing it badly, just following this basic formula,  and I was bored to death.  Yeah.  I couldn't even name any of them at this point.  Yeah.  But they're back.  But then you get Curb and Modern Family.  Arrested Development was hilarious. 
[03:05:00]  Community and a few others in there.  Parks and Rec.  Oh, 30 Rock I love.  30 Rock's hilarious.  Love it.  And that's a show that doesn't really get the audience they were hoping for.  They're still like hoping to grow that audience.  They need their big gun to drive audience through, and they've got some wonderful shows that they're  not as broad-based as some of the stuff we did, but they're real well done.  Yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  Kenny?  What?  He's got to go.  Can I have one minute to pitch three shows real fast? 
[03:05:30]  Oh, my God.  Kenny, come on.  This is so embarrassing.  I have great ideas, mister.  I bet you do.  We didn't expect this, sir.  How about a hemophiliac teacher that goes back to his old neighborhood?  I call it Welcome Back Clotter.  Oh, my God.  Kenny, that is a great idea.  He's not doing this.  That's all he wants.  He passed on that, Kenny.  That's one?  Yeah.  How about a black militant egg farmer?  I call it Malcolm Eggs.  Okay.  No, that's...  What?  I'm sorry about this. 
[03:06:00]  How about an Italian lounge singer, Snot's Amore?  Okay.  Wow.  We get him out of here.  You're copyrighted.  Kenny literally just burst in here without us saying a word.  I'm sorry.  Where were you when I needed you?  Yeah, this is my big break.  Sorry to hear that.  Yeah, it certainly is.  He's going to be knocking on my door.  Well, someone will.  It should be.  Someone needs to tell him I don't have the job anymore.  Yeah, he doesn't have the gig anymore.  What a great idea, though.  That's not what I heard.  I heard you're the man. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, my God.  Don't you have to get my truck?  Just somebody needs me.  Yes.  That's why he's pitching ideas.  Are you kidding?  Wow.  Well, Warren Littlefield, this was a pleasure, man.  We grew up with your shows, obviously.  Very cool, man.  Top of the Rock, Inside the Rise and Fall of Must See TV.  Warren Littlefield, thanks so much for coming in, man.  Hey, it's my pleasure.  Amy, you were awesome.  And, of course, then there's Amy.  Well, yeah, Amy's the real...  Come on, a whole other level over here.  She's the real new talent and the eye candy here. 
[03:07:00]  That's right.  Isn't that sad?  The sassy blonde.  You know, oh, look out.  Oh, look.  I do a lot of finger snapping.  Hand waving.  It's all the rage right here.  Yeah, yeah.  It's big.  It's big.  Yeah.  And Amy's going to be in Vegas.  Yeah, the Riviera.  When's that again?  Next?  Yeah, this coming weekend.  No.  No, next weekend.  Good plug.  What a great...  What a marketing genius.  You are good.  May 10th.  May 11th through the 13th.  May 10th, 11th, what? 
[03:07:30]  11th?  The 11th through the 13th.  At the Riviera in Vegas.  And then the Stress Factory.  Yeah, the following weekend.  And New Brunswick.  And then Marco Island, if I'm not dead.  Oh, Marco Island.  Thank you.  She likes getting food poisoning on the road.  Yeah.  She enjoys it.  That's a treat.  Yeah, it's a real...  Grab Cakes and Phoenix.  That's smart, right?  Well, Miley Cyrus says it's about the climb.  Let's get him out of here.  Warren Littlefield, thank you, Amy.  Thank you.  See you guys tomorrow.  All right.  You've heard about it.  You've waited four long hours for it. 
[03:08:00]  And now the moment you've waited for rears its ugly nose.  Head.  After Opie and Anthony Live is coming up next. </pre>
