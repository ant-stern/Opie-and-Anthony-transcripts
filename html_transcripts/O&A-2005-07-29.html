<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly from one subject to another.  The show began with their recurring “Gay or Just Plain Funny” segment, featuring numerous listener calls describing bizarre and sexually explicit situations involving male genitalia and bodily fluids.  Examples included a Marine initiation involving streaking, a brother urinating on his sibling, and various other accounts of similar nature.  The hosts also showcased listener-submitted videos of “Assaults on the Media,” where individuals disrupted news broadcasts by yelling “Opie and Anthony,” with one video showing a news reporter visibly frightened by the disruption.  They discussed Jim Norton's upcoming endoscopy and criticized Kreskin, calling him a “hack” and recounting negative past interactions.  “Big A” was mentioned as being present off-air.

The show continued with a discussion of a failed radio stunt involving Kreskin, followed by a listener's story about a friend who suspects he might be gay after waking up with several men's penises placed on his face while passed out.  This led to a humorous tangent on the unremarkable nature of family history research, contrasted with their intern Sam's surprisingly impressive genealogical claims of being related to Thomas Jefferson and William the Conqueror.  The hosts debated the legitimacy of Sam's family tree, which was eventually partially confirmed with a family book. This segment included a crude retelling of “The Aristocrats” by Cartman, a listener seeking colonoscopy advice, and a lengthy playing and mocking of a rambling audio clip of the Iron Sheik's Wrestling Hall of Fame induction.  The segment also included listener calls and advertising for GameFly, and a discussion of an article highlighting XM Satellite Radio's subscriber advantage over Sirius.  A significant portion involved a demonstration of a studio stunt where firecrackers were placed in a pear and detonated.

The next segment included a female caller's question about women regrowing pubic hair before gynecological appointments, leading to speculation on the reasons.  More "Gay or Just Plain Funny" calls followed, including stories about sex on a couch near a sleeping friend's head and a high school football hazing ritual.  A caller described a potentially unsettling encounter in a Denver restroom, prompting debate about whether it was a homosexual advance or a mugging. A "Hi Mom, I'm Gay" prank call, featuring a man announcing his homosexuality despite recently fathering a child, was also featured.  A phone interview with Paul Nardisi, author of "602 Reasons to Be Ticked Off," dominated a significant portion, punctuated by listener interruptions and the comedic reading style of a comedian guest, Andrew. This section also included a listener's story about a man spending $40,000 on prostitutes and a segment called "Danny's News Teases" featuring humorous and fear-mongering local news excerpts.

The show then shifted to a discussion about dog diarrhea and unsanitary cleanup practices, transitioning into a mocking of news teases.  Joe from Iowa shared a story about a news report where body bags concealed a driver's body from children after a school bus accident.  The conversation touched upon a website for anonymously mailing dog feces, Anthony's trip to Atlantic City to see Tom Jones, and news teases about toxic shock syndrome, Mount St. Helens, and a backyard accident.  Charlie the Trucker described the decomposition of a homeless man's feces in a parking garage.  The hosts also discussed a Houston radio show with three comedic characters and solicited listener submissions of "wacky radio" segments.  This part of the show also included a discussion of the Grand Theft Auto lawsuit. The latter half included a visit from Doug "Wheeze" Wheeze, who discussed his cancer treatment and upcoming endoscopy, along with a lengthy discussion of the hosts' political views on various issues including gay marriage and racial profiling.

Finally, a segment focused on Brother Weiss's cancer battle and recovery, including his fundraising efforts for a children's cancer camp and his financial struggles.  He discussed almost being fired ("terminated") by "the terminator."  Brother Weiss was a guest in the studio during a discussion of a fun night out at Sammy's, a Romanian restaurant, and the conversation included listener calls, one advocating for Weiss to be on XM Satellite Radio and another from comedian Mike Veneman sharing anecdotes.  The hosts mentioned an upcoming Monday announcement about the band getting back together and a planned hospital visit, possibly related to Weiss's health, along with plans to see "The Aristocrats." The show concluded with a time-out signal and the announcement that it would end on Monday.  The entire broadcast was punctuated with frequent strong language.

[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  This show is a disaster.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Let's get the show.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I've seen the cops knocking the truck window out, and I thought they was giving the man UPS. 
[00:05:30]  I thought the man was dead.  That's the way it was.  Good morning, and welcome to the Opioid Anthony program.  Hi, pleasant Friday to everyone.  Hello.  You just sit back and watch us or listen to us run through this shit one more time for you. 
[00:06:00]  Face the smile on our face and run through this shit one more time.  As we think of stuff you can't possibly be thinking up on your own.  On your own.  We help you along.  Thank you, Bill Hicks.  Wonderful.  Oh, what a large font they're using.  I know, it's scary.  Okay.  Reminding you to play gay or not gay.  No, it's not gay or not gay. 
[00:06:30]  Jim in Illinois, what's up?  As a valued listener to you people that I used to pay $1.99 a month for, I think it's my duty to remind you that you should play the gay or not gay game today.  It's not called gay or not gay, though.  That was, you requested that yesterday.  I know, I think, well, I don't know, actually.  I knew after, I knew after the phone started ringing when the show started yesterday.  Because we tape stuff for the 6 a.m. hour on the East Coast here.  Oh, you're not supposed to tell me to tape it. 
[00:07:00]  We intro a lot of our favorite bits and stuff.  It's kind of like a warm-up hour before we go live.  And that's right, we reminded people to, well, we told people to remind us about a bit we like to do from time to time.  But it's not called that.  No.  Oh, right.  It's called, I think it's gay or just funny.  Yeah, gay.  Whatever.  Gay or just plain funny.  Just plain funny.  Because guys, you know, we like to get in some strange situations sometimes.  Well.  And some people may perceive it as just being gay, and others will perceive it as just plain funny. 
[00:07:30]  It could look gay, but then it crosses a line where now it's just funny.  So then, like you, the listener, you tell your stories, and then we decide if it's gay or just plain funny.  Right.  A perfect example, I think the story that started this bit, a guy called in and wanted to mess with his friend.  And they were at a pool.  Right.  And he bet his friend, I think, something like this, that he couldn't swim underwater.  Yeah.  The complete length of the pool. 
[00:08:00]  So his friend took the bet.  He jumps in.  Everyone has done this.  And you try to get to the other side without taking a breath, obviously, right?  Yep.  As the guy pops up on the other side of the pool, there's his friend with no bathing suit on,  with his penis, like pretty much face level as the guy jumps up to Gasper Air.  Yeah, you get to the edge of the pool and you do that.  When you come break through the water.  Right.  And he's kneeling there at the edge of the pool with his schlong hanging out.  So the guy, like, pops up and he's got his friend's schlong right in front of him. 
[00:08:30]  So that goes under the category of hot.  So we ruled that that was just plain funny, believe it or not.  It seems on the outside you would say, wow, that's really gay.  Right.  And it does seem gay.  It has all the gay components that you need.  A cock, a man, two men.  Someone taking a deep breath.  Yeah.  And his mouth wide open.  Mouth open right in front of the cock.  It seems gay.  Right.  But if you look at it, it's just plain funny.  Yeah, it's just plain funny. 
[00:09:00]  And how many people will be doing that exact thing this weekend?  I'm not going near a pool.  You never know.  Not this weekend, no.  So maybe we'll take the stories and decide if it's gay or just plain funny, all right?  What is this one?  Well, we could take one now, maybe.  Max in Dallas.  Max, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hi.  I don't know, Jimmy.  I want to stick my face between your meaty breasts and go...  All right.  I want to know if this one's gay or funny. 
[00:09:30]  All right.  When I was in the Marines, every time we'd get a bunch of new guys to the duty station,  we'd take them over to the female barracks, have them stripped down nude except for their  combat boots and their gas mask, and they'd have to blacken over the eyepieces so they  couldn't see, and they'd have to streak down the hallway and make their way down the hallway  in the chick's barracks.  In the chick's barracks.  Yeah, the female marine barracks. 
[00:10:00]  So why would that be gay?  Well, I don't know.  And why would that be funny?  That isn't gay or funny.  Why are you on our phones?  I know you're a faithful listener, but you stink, Max.  Oh, my God.  That was awful.  Let's say hi to Glenn in California.  Glenn?  Yeah, hey.  Hi, a friend of mine was at the beach one day, and his brother whips out his cock and  starts pissing on his brother's leg.  Is that gay or just plain funny? 
[00:10:30]  Hmm.  Car crash or anything?  Oh, dear Lord.  But did you know that that tickled thing that you guys had is actually a pig fetus?  No?  Yes?  Two crickets.  And two Kelsey's.  Wow, you are really fucking up.  This guy is screaming at me on the text. 
[00:11:00]  Yes, I know.  You got my gay or funny story all wrong.  Dave, that was you that told that story?  Yeah, that was me, guys.  Dave from Akron, Ohio.  All right, what did we mess up?  Okay, first of all, I was the victim, not the guy that bet my friend, or dared my friend  to do it.  My friend dared me to swim underwater, and it wasn't his schlong that was waiting for me  on the other end.  He was turned around backwards and had his ass, where I came up and gasped for air.  My face just, like, went right in his ass. 
[00:11:30]  Ah.  It just went right in his ass.  Well, maybe the cock was all wishful thinking here in the studio.  Right.  We just added a few details.  You know, at looking back...  Yeah, but you know what?  Dave made his story funnier.  Yeah.  If you were chuckling a little bit out there, I think Dave made you laugh even harder.  His asshole was right in your face.  Yeah, he seemed to get a little more enjoyment out of it than I did.  I'm sure he did.  Looking back.  Hey, good morning, Liddy. 
[00:12:00]  All right.  I don't think Liddy's in studio yet.  Punching out.  Mr. Liddy's out.  Yeah, Liddy is not here yet.  You've got to know our eating habits.  Everyone knows Jim starts eating...  Well, no, you eat yogurt right around now, but Jimmy cannot eat.  No eating.  Or drink.  Or drink.  Ever again, right?  No?  Yes.  Oh.  A lot isn't permitted.  Helpful.  Allow it.  Jim is having a procedure today, so he had to do the famous don't eat for a while thing.  Six hours, yeah.  Six hours.  Six hours, that's it?  That has to be done.  That has to be done with every procedure. 
[00:12:30]  If you have a procedure.  What is it for your, to see if you have acid reflux?  Yes.  I'm getting an endoscopy.  Ooh.  Which is they have to go down your throat there to knock you out.  It's an easy procedure, but it's just your natural thing.  It'll probably be to vomit with the thing going down your throat.  Really?  They might think you might gag or something if they're putting this big thing down your throat?  Yeah.  Tom, what do you think you're dealing with?  A rookie here?  Come on, Doc.  Doc, if you don't put on a dress for not doing it, I've told you once.  I've told you a hundred times.  It's an illusion. 
[00:13:00]  Paint the apparatus black, and I shan't have a problem.  So, yeah, I've got to get this done at like 11.  I thought it was like noon, but I can't drink for six hours first.  Aw.  So you'll be leaving us today?  It's 10.30.  It's right around the corner for the 8th Street.  I wish we could all leave at 10.30.  I wish I didn't have to.  If we all left at 10.30, then what would happen, Jimmy?  She'll be a half hour of just quiet.  I certainly hope they don't leave you waiting like the last doctor.  No, this guy is good, I think.  Yeah.  He's an orthopedist.  I wish I could remember her name. 
[00:13:30]  Gallon, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah, on 58th Street.  Left you waiting in the waiting room for an hour and a half.  My ankle still hurts.  Two hours.  I still can't do yoga.  Were you going to get into yoga?  I started.  I took a couple of yoga lessons.  Stop.  You didn't.  I certainly did.  Private yoga lessons.  Let's see if I liked it.  I actually want to get up to Bikram Yoga.  Yeah.  Who's teaching you?  Donkey sausage?  No.  No one suggested to me that I should do that.  What's it called?  Bikram Yoga.  Bikram?  Bikram Yoga.  Have you heard about this Bikram Yoga yet? 
[00:14:00]  I couldn't tell you one yoga from the next.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I was thinking about doing a little yoga myself.  Yoga.  Yoga.  And then Elo suggested this Bikram Yoga.  I guess there's one up on the Upper West Side.  Bikram must mean with bad hair.  No?  And, you know, Logan is in just horrendous shape.  Oh, God.  Don't say that.  He isn't.  So, I don't know what he got out of the yoga, but I know why he was going to the Bikram Yoga  and why he wants us to go to the Bikram Yoga. 
[00:14:30]  Because XM is starting a Bikram Yoga channel, right?  No?  Assumed Elo is just getting a perk.  It's regular yoga, but it's in a heated room.  It's 105 degrees.  Oh, I've heard about that.  Maybe even hotter than that.  No?  That's insane.  It's way up there.  Well, this is what Elo said.  He goes, you've got to go immediately because the women go there and they barely wear anything  because it's so freaking hot.  Oh.  All I'm thinking is sweating.  And then you've got them bending all over the place in these crazy positions.  The camel toe you'd see?  Yeah, you're pretty much seeing. 
[00:15:00]  Wow, sweaty camel toe.  You're pretty much seeing things.  Seeing all kinds of things.  Maybe Elo should start with a sit-up instead of the yoga.  See, I went to that ridiculous, the mud caves in Colorado, and they were 100 and something  degrees in there.  I'm going to say gay, by the way.  Gay?  That's gay and not funny?  Yeah.  Going to the mud cave?  Yeah.  I just wanted my record to say my vote is for gay.  I went to the Colorado mud cave.  His name is Bill. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, it was the Colorado mud cave.  There are these little caverns, and there's mud on the walls.  It's natural mud that seeps through the mountain, and there's hot springs in there, so the heat  is in the 105, 108, I don't know, degrees in there.  It's really hot.  And all these hippies go in there and use the mud and rub it on themselves.  Man, it's got some healing powers, man.  And I'm like, this stinks like hippie feet, and it's hot and annoying, and I want out. 
[00:16:00]  I want to go back to the hotel pool.  It was awful.  So I don't like that hot, sweaty, in a room with people thing.  You don't like that?  Not at all.  You don't like that in the room people thing.  The mud is to be applied at a 45-degree angle.  No, I don't like the people thing.  You're right.  But I go to Atlantic City.  I'm going there after the show.  I'm going to do some gambling.  I've got to sit in a room with a lot of people.  You're going to be touching a lot of dirty chips. 
[00:16:30]  A lot of dirty chips.  Are you going to be all right with that?  I've got my Purell.  I've got Purell my hands after every hand.  And then the tables are so small, because they've got to fit more of them in there, that you're just squashed in there next to filthy-smoking Asians and fat ladies.  You've got to squeeze in, and your thighs are touching.  The Asians love that gambling.  I don't get that.  Oh, they smoke like crazy.  They all weigh 90 pounds, and they lose money like mad men. 
[00:17:00]  And I hope to answer why they like it, they all have poker faces.  I knew that was going to happen.  What has he got?  He either has a straight flush or a seven deuce.  He's got nothing.  Can't tell if he's blushing or if he has a flush.  A flush.  John in Kentucky.  What's up, John?  Hey, good morning, guys.  I've got a Ben's hog joke.  Calling from the shuttle open.  He's trying to bring back the Ben's hog thing. 
[00:17:30]  All right, let's give him a shot.  Good luck.  Go ahead, John.  All right, buddy.  Ben's hog was so big, it was used as an expert.  Extra detour alternate tube during the London subcar explosions, subway explosions.  Not funny.  I've got Ben's hog in my hand.  I'm punching out.  Okay, terrific.  Wow.  You can't punch out, sir.  You are in a crater that is on fire right now,  and the fire crews are screaming towards it with foam to spray in the hole. 
[00:18:00]  You so crashed and burned.  Just the way he enunciated silly to get every gem of a word out.  That was awful.  Paul on Long Island.  Yeah, I just want to say that I really appreciate Jimmy showing up every morning  because, like, on the other show, you know, Howard's show,  this guy Artie just doesn't bother to show up anymore.  Really?  I couldn't tell you.  Today, like, there's no show.  I think he's going to bail on that show soon. 
[00:18:30]  I couldn't tell you.  We're back, Jackie.  Artie's a funny guy.  The one time I met him, he was very nice to me, so that's all I know.  I'm going to apply for the job again.  What, is he not going into the gig, dude?  He's just not showing up?  He just didn't, like, bother to show up.  Like, I think he may have something going on with HBO,  and he's just, like, cracking up doing both at once.  Well, the problem over there is Howard has such an ego,  he doesn't take care of his people.  And most of these people realize that and move on to bigger and better things.  Wasn't Artie filming a movie or something? 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, he's doing something.  He can't handle both things at once, and, like, I just hope he leaves.  He'll really be fucked.  All right.  Thank you, Paul.  Take care, guys.  All right, there you go.  Let's say hi to Harry in Tulsa.  Harry!  Hey, what's happening, boys?  What's up?  I just want to say good morning.  I wish little Jimmy Norton a happy birthday.  Thank you, buddy, very much.  It's not his birthday!  Thank you, sir.  Let me explain this birthday thing in the month of July.  Uh-huh.  If your birthday falls in the month of July, like mine does, 
[00:19:30]  two days before Jimmy Norton's,  you're allowed to celebrate from July 1 to July 31.  And that's how that works.  This guy's drunk.  But it's not his birthday.  Happy birthday, buddy.  Thank you very much.  I appreciate it.  I hate you all.  I didn't think anybody would remember.  I got a gay for you.  All right.  Go ahead, Harry.  I like this Harry guy.  I used to live in Nashville, Tennessee. 
[00:20:00]  Uh-huh.  And I was going around with this 19-year-old girl, a college girl.  And she had an 18-year-old roommate.  So for a while, I was trying to get them, you know, to get together in a threesome.  Uh-huh.  So, you know, eventually, you know, she got tired of me asking her.  She was, I'll go ask my friend.  So she asked her, and they come ask her, we'll do it for you,  but you got to wear a miniskirt for us for the entire weekend.  So you tell me, gay or not gay?  But I got all three of them.  You wore a miniskirt. 
[00:20:30]  So you guys aren't getting the bit.  If girls are involved, it's not that gay.  Then it's not gay at all.  Right.  If you ought to wear a miniskirt to bed down a couple of girls at a clip there,  that's not gay, but it's not funny either, sir.  It's just you bragging, isn't it?  You're just boasting.  You're using our airwaves to brag.  You're a braggart.  Braggart.  Pushing on.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thanks, buddy.  Joe, what's up?  Yeah, I had the same procedure that Jim had. 
[00:21:00]  I just want to know what doctor he's going to that he can't put to sleep.  You know, I didn't get to put to sleep for mine.  No?  I think you could do both ways.  I've heard, did they go through your sinuses or through your throat?  They went through my throat.  I know other people that have gone, and they've all said that they were knocked out.  Oh, man.  All right, bro.  Good luck.  How long did it take?  How long did it take?  A couple hours.  A couple hours?  You must have went for something different.  You know, I was in there for an hour, about a 45-minute jam,  but, you know, I was there for a couple hours at the doctor's. 
[00:21:30]  All right.  It's a very quick procedure.  Yeah, I'm sure you just got to shove that down.  Yeah, whatever you got to say, because I'm new to this shit.  All right.  Let's go to Bill in Jersey.  Bill, what's up?  Yo, my mom's an endoscopy nurse, and she did the procedure actually on me.  And you go right to sleep, but it feels like five seconds go by,  and all of a sudden your eyes are opening,  and you feel them pulling this, like, Ben's hog-length tube out of your throat,  and you're burping, like, it's not really, you're not choking,  but you're just, like, burping, and they're pulling this tube out. 
[00:22:00]  It's awful.  Whatever.  It's awful.  But you'll be all right, Jimmy.  I'm fine, dude.  Why don't they wake you up after they pull it out?  Maybe they do.  This is the first I've heard of that.  You never want to have a procedure and ask people about it,  because they will always tell you just all this bullshit that gets you all nervous,  and you don't want Jimmy to be.  When you wake up and your esophagus is all over your chest,  you have to put it back, but you're still locked up.  What?  You'll be fine.  Don't scare Jimmy.  Let's say hi to Paul in Boston.  Oh, no.  Paul. 
[00:22:30]  What's up, guys?  Go ahead, Paul.  What's going on, guys?  Let's go, Paul.  You're killing us.  In high school, me and my buddies, this is a funny, a gay story.  Back in high school, me and my buddies, a bunch of us from white water wrapped in  and rented a really nice cabin, had a kitchen, living room, and everything.  And on the last night, we decided to take the ice cube tray and take turns.  We beat off into it one at a time and then filled the rest of it with water  and put it back in the freezer for the next people. 
[00:23:00]  Did you guys whack off together?  No, no.  All right, so that takes the gay out of it.  No, it doesn't take the gay out of it.  Why not?  Because we wasn't even in the room together.  We would one at a time, one in the bathroom.  And then would you take the ice cube tray full of jizz  and hold it in your hand as you spanked into it?  Yeah.  So you're looking at other man's loads in the various little ice cube tray nooks, 
[00:23:30]  whatever they're called.  Yeah, that's kind of gay.  You're holding another man's load.  I'm going with...  No physical touching.  Yeah, no...  They didn't see each other doing the actual act.  I'm going to go with not gay.  I don't know.  And sort of funny.  That's...  That's...  Jimmy, what about you?  What's happening?  It says gay.  I'm saying not gay, sort of funny.  I'm saying it's got some gay...  It's a little gay on it.  Say it again, sir. 
[00:24:00]  Jimmy wasn't listening to this call.  He wasn't listening.  I wasn't...  Dude, I'm sorry.  You were not even listening.  40 grand escort tab.  It caught my attention.  You were not listening to this caller at all.  This is a caller?  You have no clue.  I'm sorry.  I apologize, sir.  You could have been talking about anything and I wouldn't have known.  Basically, these guys were renting a house.  They took turns whacking off into an ice cube tray.  One at a time, by themselves in the bathroom.  Put some water in it, froze it, and let people use the ice cube.  And left it for the next people that were using the house.  It's not gay.  It's just awful. 
[00:24:30]  It really is awful.  It's not gay at all, no.  But I think holding an ice cube tray with other man's loads in it as you're jerking is a little...  It's a little gayness in there.  It's gross, but it's not done to be gay.  Me and Levy, me and Bob Levy wrapped up on a TV together.  It would be gay if you took your finger, dipped it in, and used it as face cream, Anthony.  What if you took a taste like you would when Mom was making cookies?  Right.  Puddin'.  If you're just looking at it, it's a little awkward, but it's not gay unless you're going to do stuff with it.  All right.  But I have to now ask about jerking off on a TV, Jimmy. 
[00:25:00]  Me, Bobby, and Florentine were doing a gig in Maryland many years ago.  I was making 25 a show, I think.  And Jim went out to get laid.  It was probably 1990 and 91, and me and Bob, we were all sharing a room.  These guys would let me share the room with them.  They would share a room instead of getting two rooms and then pocket the extra money from the club.  Oh.  Like with two beds.  And one of them would actually let me stay in their bed and we'd get a cot.  You know what I mean?  Would you sleep in the same bed as another man sometimes?  Yeah, but it wasn't a Moe thing.  These guys were always banging chicks. 
[00:25:30]  It was just, you know, so I didn't have to go home.  Yeesh.  Never.  Bob's an alcoholic.  He would just drink and be passed out with a pizza box on his chest.  So Florentine's out getting laid one time, and me and Bob decide to whack off on the TV so he'll have to see that when he comes back.  So I forget who went first, but I think Levy did it first.  And we didn't see each other's dicks.  Like he would just stand up, and I'm just giggling, laying in the bed because he's wearing sweatpants, and he fucking arcs an awful one.  And I think I had to go up after and just like look straight ahead, and I finally was able to shoot one on the TV. 
[00:26:00]  All right.  Just animals.  Now that definitely qualifies because it is pretty funny that he's going to come back to the room, turn the TV on, and it's just going to be dripping jizz.  But this is the beautiful part.  Florentine, they had long hair back then.  He walks in, he saw it, he just goes beautiful and goes to bed.  Didn't phase him.  Beautiful.  That's pretty funny.  All right.  We'll take one more here.  Let's say hi to Sal in New York. 
[00:26:30]  Sal.  How you doing?  Good morning, guys.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Hey, Sal.  Listen, I want to know if a bunch of guys doing a radio show and they stare at their producers hog all day.  Is that gay or just plain funny?  It's just plain funny, sir.  That's hysterical.  That falls under you can't help it.  We don't want to look, sir.  All right.  Punch it out, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  There's a ton of these coming in now.  Chris in Ohio.  Chris?  Hey, how you guys doing?  All right. 
[00:27:00]  Been with you since day one of XM.  This is a gay or funny thing.  When I was in Boy Scouts back in the 80s, we were at Boy Scout camp, and this one guy had this massive, massive tool.  A good 10 inches.  We had some other little kids in there, and this one little kid was kind of a wimpy little kid.  And he was one of these kids you, like, loved to hate. 
[00:27:30]  Well...  Oh, my gosh.  Yeah, I know.  It's good.  Your storytelling abilities really suck, sir.  Yeah.  There's a lot of long gaps, and you're really adding a little too much to it.  Did people tell you you really tell a lousy story?  Yeah.  Is it because you're a little nervous?  A little bit, yeah.  Yeah.  Don't worry, man.  It's only like a...  It's about a million people these days, you know, herd all the way to L.A. and up into Canada and stuff. 
[00:28:00]  So there's no big deal.  International.  I'll just jump to the chase.  All right.  He's chasing this kid around the camp, buck naked, with one of those bonsai headbands around his cock.  Kid falls, turns around, stares at him, and he grabs his tool and smacks him across the face with it,  with the kid with a look of shock on his face.  Incredibly funny.  At least I thought so.  But is it gay? 
[00:28:30]  Thanks, Chris.  Wow.  Now that's called a crime.  Anthony, before we take our first break and then come back and talk about the $40,000 escort bill,  this guy's a classic. 
[00:29:00]  We had an assault on the media that was done in Philly.  We finally got the tape.  I heard rumors about this, but you've got to send us proof of these assaults on the media to be in on the contest.  Everyone should know about the contest by now.  The best assault on the media for the month of July wins a MiFi and a day in the studio with the show.  And then we're going to start the contest up again for the month of August.  And then for September, then October, we're pretty much going to do it for the rest of the year.  Yeah.  And I think the prizes, hopefully, will get bigger and bigger as we move on here.  I like how the listeners are really coming to the table with this now. 
[00:29:30]  They were off to a little slow start.  A lot of the assaults on the media were done by our own staff.  And now...  We did one yesterday.  Yep.  That video's up on opianthony.com, by the way.  You see the little fat kid get hit in the head?  It's really funny.  They were doing a bubble gum...  Bubble blowing contest.  Thank you.  And Clayton, one of our interns, went down to the Today Show.  Or was it Good Morning America?  Can't really tell.  Yeah, same.  Good Morning America, same show, whatever.  And held up a huge Opie and Anthony sign, and then the wind took the sign, and it hit a kid in the head or something. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, kind of the wind hit the sign, hit him on the head, and the kid turns around like,  Hey, what are you doing?  Right.  Well, the video's up for your viewing pleasures.  Pleasure.  Opianthony.com, of course.  Well, we finally got the tape of these two knuckleheads in Philly.  Tony in Philadelphia is taking credit for this one.  This really hot reporter was doing some kind of dumb story.  And out of nowhere, these two guys run up to her and scream in her ear, 
[00:30:30]  Opianthony.  Opianthony.  Or Opianthony Rule.  I forget exactly.  We got the audio here.  It scares the bejesus out of this woman.  She jumps pretty much, and then she can't even talk anymore.  And they have to just go to the tape.  They cut and go right to the tape.  That she was introing.  It's classic.  And the video's up on Opianthony.com.  Is it good enough to win the Assault on the Media contest for the month of July?  You know what might be better?  Not to overthink it too much.  And it's very tempting right when they go live to jump in because that's your spot. 
[00:31:00]  But wouldn't it be better to jump in after the story?  After they roll the tape?  You know how they always go back to the reporter after they roll the tape?  That way they have nothing to cut to.  They have to either stick with her or go back to the anchors who then have to comment on it.  But when you hit them first before the tape, they have the tape to go to,  and then they can kind of let people forget what just happened.  I think it's up to the individual because sometimes you know this is your shot. 
[00:31:30]  That's your shot.  I know.  It's almost like you're sacrificing a good shot for something that might not pan out very well.  But I would love to see that.  Yeah, maybe if you do wait.  But sometimes they don't go back.  What do they do?  I don't know.  Sometimes they just go to commercials or something.  I've never seen them go from the person to a commercial.  Usually they go back to the anchor who then have to comment on it.  I think when you're in that situation, you know when you've got a hit.  Take your shot, right.  Maybe you see that you only have a window of opportunity that's closing fast, 
[00:32:00]  and you want to get it in.  I'd like to see that, though, because you know the anchors would just be like,  oh, that's horrible.  What idiots.  Here's the video.  We're watching it here in the studio.  You can watch for yourself later on OpenAnthony.com.  She is petrified.  Anthony, describe the video.  You're really good at the...  It's two animals.  Okay, it's going to start over?  She starts her shot.  She's talking.  It's every single newscaster you've ever seen do this.  Right.  She's talking on the mic, adjusting her earpiece, 
[00:32:30]  and two animals come flying into frame right behind her and yell,  ONA, ONA Rock, or whatever they say.  She shudders and winces and steps to the side to get out of the way  as if there was an explosion behind her.  Right.  She reacted the same way as if something exploded behind her.  And then gives these guys a look of death.  Yeah, turns around.  She's pissed off.  Can't finish what she was saying, and they go right to the tape.  Right.  And then gives that look like, oh, you sons of bitches.  You mitherfickers.  Here's the audio. 
[00:33:00]  You know, it's not going to do this justice,  so make sure you check out the video later today on opieandanthony.com.  Four.  Brandy.  Well, Alicia, this story has taken so many turns,  and what we've learned tonight is that...  I'll get it today!  I'll get it!  And that's where they cut into the tape.  The sign welcoming Omar Lazama de la Rosa home is being torn down and crumpled up.  I can hear an opie and Anthony right when she goes live, too.  Oh, really?  You're very low in the background.  Right.  Play it again.  You can hear it. 
[00:33:30]  Four.  Brandy.  Well, Alicia, this story has taken so many...  Very good.  So they must have said, well, that wasn't loud enough.  And they ran right up to her.  And it was perfect because they didn't touch the reporter.  That's the key to this.  No, they were very loud.  Brandy.  Well, Alicia, this story has taken so many turns,  and what we've learned tonight is...  I'll get it today!  I'll get it!  And they panicked back in the newsroom,  and they just cut right to the tape.  She wasn't able to finish her intro there. 
[00:34:00]  Poor Brandy.  Well, Alicia, this story has taken so many turns,  and what we've learned tonight is...  I'll get it today!  I'll get it!  The sign welcoming...  Oh, you know there was just the director in there going,  go to the tape!  Go to the tape!  Go to the tape!  Awesome!  Great!  Well, our Monday show will crown the winner of the Assault on the Media contest for the month of July.  Mm-hmm.  That guy is in the running! 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  Also, Cape Guy from Springfield.  Loved Cape Guy.  The guy who did his Assault on the Media with a cape on.  He had a sign and everything.  Oh, yeah, we have his audio?  We can play him real fast.  All right, here's the one from Philly one more time as I get the other one queued up.  Poor Brandy.  Well, Alicia, this story has taken so many turns,  and what we've learned tonight is...  I'll get it today!  I'll get it!  The sign welcoming...  Drunken animals. 
[00:35:00]  Complete asses.  You guys see the video, too, because they're so excited.  Yeah.  They're just out of their minds.  They get right in there.  They got big smiles on their faces.  I think the one dude just dragged the other guy in with them.  Yeah, they got...  Did they have their arms around each other?  Well, it's almost like he pulled them...  Like, come here, buddy.  Yeah, come with me.  We're doing this now.  So, and then this is the one from Springfield.  This guy was wearing an ONA shirt, and he had a cape.  Right.  A big yellow cape, and he ran into frame.  All these videos are up on opianathlete.com. 
[00:35:30]  Well, the chief has a hurdle to overcome.  Today, she went before the city's retirement board.  What she wants the board to do is to increase her compensation annually,  the retirement compensation, from $109,000 a year to nearly $150,000.  Well, the chief was successful in one suspect today.  XM Satellite Radio.  OPA and we are back on XM Satellite Radio.  Maybe you can brief it.  Or Brandy.  Well, Alicia, this story has taken so many turns. 
[00:36:00]  And what we've learned tonight is...  OPA and we are back on XM Satellite Radio.  OPA and we are back on XM Satellite Radio.  OPA and we are back on XM Satellite Radio.  That is great.  They're both great, man.  God, we've got to get a montage of us...  Oh, man!  ...of our listeners just bothering these reporters.  I would love to hear a montage.  I think that could be really funny.  Yeah.  So there you have it.  We'll announce the winner on Monday.  I think it's between Tim in Springfield and this new one from Philly.  Yeah, good one. 
[00:36:30]  And we'll announce it on Monday.  Maybe one will happen over the weekend or today.  You never know.  A last-minute attempt that might take the title for July.  That's a good question.  Doing an attack on the media with your arm around your friend.  Is it gay or just plain funny?  I'm going to go with just plain funny.  Yeah?  Yes.  Just plain funny.  They're like...  It's that pal arm around him.  So around his neck.  We've talked about this in the past.  He's the arm around...  Arm around the guy guy.  Right.  Arm around another guy guy. 
[00:37:00]  Didn't we have a song and everything?  Oh, yeah, we did.  I forgot about that bit.  Yeah, we did.  Oh, the arm around the guy guy.  I hate that.  You see it at the ball games all the time.  I think that's where it got started.  Sometimes someone just feels compelled.  Sitting in a seat at a ball game, you're watching your favorite team,  and you're there with a bunch of guys,  and one guy will put his arm either on the back of your chair  where his hand is touching your shoulder,  and they're completely comfortable with hanging out with their arm around you. 
[00:37:30]  It's the arm around the guy guy.  It is the worst.  Why would you do that?  You're at a restaurant, and he's leaning back in his chair,  puts his arm up on the back of your chair.  Yeah.  Get your fucking arm off of there.  Put your arm around me.  And they're completely comfortable.  Not a gay thing, not anything.  It's just he wants to have his arm around you.  Hey, dude, how you doing?  I think it was to the Wham song. 
[00:38:00]  The arm around the guy guy.  That was awful.  It was.  Boy, that's going way back.  All right.  Find that one, people.  A lot of these old bits you could listen to on oavirus.com for the new listeners.  We refer to them from time to time,  and you can listen for yourself some of the stuff we did in the old days.  Oavirus.com.  All right.  From Whackbag, that fucking video is hilarious.  Just watched it.  The Philly one?  Yeah.  Great clip.  People definitely, the review is coming in. 
[00:38:30]  They're raving.  It really is funny, man.  And I love when we annoy these reporters.  I can't get enough of it.  Self-important jack-offs.  I can't get enough of it.  All right.  Here we go.  We're going to take a break, Anthony.  Yes.  When we get back, Kreskin is up to some of his old tricks.  What an idiot this guy is.  We'll tell you exactly what happened.  It's so obvious what happened.  Really?  Yeah.  You know?  They were in cahoots together.  Oh.  You think?  Oh, so obvious.  That sounds like something that's pretty, I don't know, it doesn't sound like something 
[00:39:00]  that a station would do.  Right.  Just to make this guy, you know, put him over.  Right.  Wait.  Someone in Buffalo getting very upset.  What?  Jackie.  Hey, what's up?  What's up, Jackie?  What's up?  How are you?  Good.  Are you a Buffalo Betty?  What's a Buffalo Betty?  A Buffalo Betty.  Buffalo Betty is one of you fatter broads that really like your beer and your chicken wings 
[00:39:30]  and your fish fry.  No.  It's the stereotypical Buffalo girl.  Your fish fry Fridays.  Are they still doing fish fry Fridays up in Buffalo?  They always do.  They always do.  And then you guys get those big bunts, so what happens, you get stretchy pants and a  big sweatshirt or sweater that kind of covers the mess.  They're all over Buffalo.  And we used to call them Buffalo Bettys.  You like Buffalo, Ope?  I, I, yeah, I enjoyed my time in Buffalo.  Well, I just got a new car and I got you guys on XM and I love it. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, good.  I don't even listen to Howard anymore.  Howard who?  This show is so much better.  Exactly.  I was just telling my husband because he's sitting right next to me and I'm like, I feel  so much funnier.  I'm like actually almost pissing my pants laughing at you.  Thank you, Jackie.  Thank you, Jackie.  So you wanted to play the Buffalo Assault on the media, right?  Yes, I can.  I don't know if that one was, um, I think that was more of a visual.  That's the problem when you're doing it.  Oh, that doesn't sound good.  Yeah, we'd like to play, but it was more of a visual. 
[00:40:30]  Well, no, I think it's just the audio of the reporters, what you would hear, right?  I don't think Paul talked.  Yeah, that's the problem when you're doing a radio show and you're doing Assault on the  media that's very visual.  You know, when these guys yell out Opie and Anthony and stuff, then it's fun to, you know,  play the audio, obviously.  We had a great Assault on the media yesterday at Good Morning America, but we can't play it  on the radio because there was nothing said.  Hey, can I do, can you guys do my favor?  Yeah.  Can I say hi to someone back in Buffalo?  Because we're six hours away from Buffalo right now. 
[00:41:00]  All right, go ahead.  Hey, Justin.  I couldn't even understand who she said hi to.  All right, Jackie, thank you.  All right, so when we get back, we'll talk about Kreskin.  Yes, Jimmy?  Did we ever get an explanation as to why Andy Dick just canceled?  No, that's right.  Well, he's in the paper.  He's canceled all interviews for today.  Oh, he has?  What they're saying.  We'll see what happens.  All right, maybe he did.  We'll get into that after the break.  We've got lots to do.  We've got the Iron Sheik audio we never got to yesterday.  We've got more of Jim Norton's interviews with the gang from Black Sabbath. 
[00:41:30]  Ooh.  And there was something else that I can't remember at this moment, but...  Liddy?  Oh, well, Liddy might make an appearance, and we've got the Big A outside the studio.  Big A is out there.  What is he doing today?  You know that...  Lurking.  Yeah, he's definitely lurking.  Besides being a creep.  You know, we had the director of The Aristocrats in, and he turned us on to that website.  What was it again?  Do you remember the name of it offhand?  No?  Bueller?  Anyone?  No?  Hawk.  Hawk, you don't remember? 
[00:42:00]  It was only a day ago.  H-T-T-P colon slash slash W-W-W dot...  Remember there was a wacky encyclopedia thing?  By the way, I had it over here to the right.  He knows exactly where it was.  I love when old people, like, their people tell them that they have to get a website,  and then they try to plug it, and they can't get it right.  It's W-dot...  W-dot...  W-dot...  A-com... 
[00:42:30]  They just have no clue.  Yeah, I have a website.  Oh, you do?  I have an internet site, a net site thing.  W-dot...  Apple.  It's that blow-by-blow website.  Radar...  Oh, yeah.  Radarmagazine.com.  And then they have, like, you know...  Someone just puts on instant feedback.  Radar something.  Thank you.  Thanks for the help, you asses.  It's really funny reading.  Radarmagazine.com, and it's a lot of sex acts and terms and stuff. 
[00:43:00]  Mm-hmm.  And then they describe how this, like, word is used in the movie, like anus, for example.  Yep.  And we were reading some of these the other day.  We thought it would be really funny if Andrew read from this encyclopedia today.  So he'll do that off and on throughout the show, okay?  Some people are saying the listeners on the phones are a little low today.  Really?  Is that true?  Let me take a look here.  I get everything through the feedback, and if I see two, I say there's a pattern, and  I...  All right.  Let me see.  Tell you accordingly. 
[00:43:30]  Okay.  Let's go to Red in Utah.  Red?  Yeah.  Hey, what's up, man?  Well, first of all, we're going to do an audio check.  Red?  Audio check.  Okay.  Yeah.  Say that about three or four times.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  You're at minus four PGMs.  Let me raise...  Oh, it's minus four PGMs.  Obviously.  Minus four PGMs is usually right in range, Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Anyone should have known that.  I'll boost you a little bit.  I'm going to get you up to about a minus two PGM. 
[00:44:00]  All right.  All right.  There you go.  How'd that feel?  All right.  I don't know.  Hey, it's good for me, man.  All right.  All right.  What's your story as we go to break?  All right, man.  When we drank it over at my neighbor's house, he passed out, so we laid a dildo on his chest  so the head of it was touching his nose, took a picture of him with a digital camera,  and then emailed the picture to his mother.  Ooh.  Just plain funny.  Yeah, that's just funny.  That's really great.  That's just plain funny.  I mean, I'm from Utah, so the Mormon family, they were real impressed with it. 
[00:44:30]  I gather.  All right, Red.  Take care, guys.  All the way in Utah.  Let's take a break, and we'll continue.  We got lots to do today.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the ONA virus.  What else is in Giant Magazine there, Jamie?  Well, we sort of have a return of Piper Paraboo, if you remember her, from Coyote Ugly.  She was the lead girl dancing on the bar.  Everybody remembers her, and then she sort of went away as well. 
[00:45:00]  Now she's back with a movie called The Cave, which is coming out this fall.  She's just really hot, cute, you know, and a great interview, too.  I mean, just very, you know, she wanted to do the indie thing, so Coyote Ugly kind of  freaked her out.  She got a little too famous, wanted to do it for the art, for the role, and so she was  in five or six indie movies that no one saw, and now she's decided she wants to be a Hollywood  actor again.  Have you ever interviewed Parker Posey?  I didn't do the interview with Parker.  We did her in the second issue, actually. 
[00:45:30]  We shot her.  How come she doesn't go mainstream?  You know, she asked one of the interns for a bat.  Why are you a good Parker Posey fan?  Huh?  She's a great actor.  Why did she go mainstream?  Why did she go mainstream?  She's a great actor.  Well, we asked her that.  They asked her.  No, that's a goddamn good question.  Do you have a section on your paper for dumb questions you asked?  That's a fucking great question.  What's wrong with you?  Yeah, it's great.  Anthony's yawning.  Anthony hasn't yawned in three months. 
[00:46:00]  You guys don't like Parker in the show.  Parker's hot, man.  She's great.  We like her, but we don't need to know why she hasn't gotten mainstream.  What the fuck does that mean?  And also, on the same thing, what do you feel about Dustin Diamond and his conservative  political view on fiscal responsibility?  You should be executed.  Mainstream.  Mainstream.  Will you explain yourself?  Then you go and say, that's a great question.  Because Parker Posey, one, is a great actress and great looking, but she only does small, 
[00:46:30]  independent movies.  How come she hasn't gone to Hollywood and done mainstream films?  She's in that little independent film that's coming out next year called Superman, you fucking  idiot.  She's in the new Superman movie.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  At least. 
[00:47:00]  What happened?  Just showed a clip of Seinfeld.  And I'm just saying, do you know how rich that son of a bitch is?  And Jimmy said, you know, he's got to have at least a half mil for the bank, at least.  They're doing a piece on NBC, the Today Show, called Hug It Out.  Hug It Out?  I really want the audio bad.  I don't know what it is.  It just seems to be the whole thing that they're pushing to have men hugging.  I like it.  They got construction workers hugging.  Al Roker is walking around New York hugging men. 
[00:47:30]  It is really awkward.  Yeah, it's uncomfortable looking.  He's walking through Chelsea teaching them to hug chest to chest instead of both facing  the same way.  They hug you.  All right.  Yeah, we'll see if anybody got that on tape.  I don't know.  I don't know what's going on behind the scenes today.  Yeah?  I don't know.  He's making men hug, and they're all uncomfortable.  He's like walking up and going.  It just goes to show you what people will do if you're just a semi-celebrity with a microphone. 
[00:48:00]  You could get people to do anything.  Now, yeah.  He's got the photographers hugging.  People will do anything.  Shove a mic in their face.  Go ahead.  Suck that guy's cock.  I'm not Gabe.  I'm not hugging you, Jimmy.  We have it?  All right, cool.  Thank you.  Won't be hugging you, Jimmy.  Travis is answering the phones.  Usually he watches TV and brings good stuff to us. 
[00:48:30]  But it seems someone is shirking their responsibility today.  Danny overslapped, so Danny's doing something.  I don't know what's going on.  Danny is shirking his responsibility, and now somebody has to cover for Danny, and the  guy that's covering for Danny, Travis, usually covers this TV thing for us.  Yeah, it's a new bit, and I think it has a lot of potential, where Travis just watches  TV all morning and brings to us some of the stupider things that are going on.  I guess Danny thought that segment went a little too well yesterday for Travis, and he came  in late knowing that Travis would have to take over the phones and not have back-to-back 
[00:49:00]  good bits on the show.  But Danny might be working on the fear news teases.  I think we might have another installment of that today.  Well, he was late.  I don't know.  I don't know what's going on.  We'll get to the bottom of it.  He has to be reprimanded.  Anthony, really fast.  This is a quickie.  Kreskin is at it again.  We love Kreskin, and we hate Kreskin.  He's truly a hack.  Love to hate him.  He's truly a hack.  If there is a hack mentalist, it is Kreskin. 
[00:49:30]  Can you be a hack mentalist?  If you're a mentalist, you are a hack.  For my whole life, people have used his name.  What are you, Kreskin?  It has become a word.  It is not just his name anymore.  It's a word that you use if somebody says something that then happens.  You go, oh, hey, Kreskin.  Right.  Yeah.  If you think a friend of yours might have some kind of psychic abilities,  what are you, Kreskin?  Kreskin?  We've heard it our whole lives, and then we had this Kreskin character come in,  and he was the biggest hack.  Yeah. 
[00:50:00]  And Kreskin was nothing about a ripoff of Criswell.  Yeah, exactly.  Tell him, Fred.  I was predicting things years ago.  Tell him, Fred.  But we finally got to hang with Kreskin after all these years of hearing about him.  Kreskin's just an asshole.  He comes in, and you put your hand out to shake his hand, and here's what Kreskin does.  He'll grab your hand, squeeze really hard, and shake your hand so fast and hard  that it actually hurts your elbow and shoulder, like he's pulling it out of the socket. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, he almost dislocates your shoulder.  Why are you doing that, you idiot?  He gives you that Bugs Bunny, good, baka, baka, baka, baka, handshake.  And then he does magic tricks that, like your old uncle...  Uncle.  I was waiting for him to pull a quarter out of my ear.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, here it is, and here it is, and you could keep that.  Thanks.  Thanks.  The old uncle trick where he puts your face in the pillow, and he pulls your dignity out  through your ass.  No, see, Jimmy, mysteriously smell whiskey breath. 
[00:51:00]  Our upbringings were slightly different than yours.  I'm lucky.  Loving family.  We really have no reference point to half the shit we talk about.  Why?  We were hugging back then.  Yeah.  So, Kreskin, I guess, was doing another radio show.  He won't do our show anymore, because we called him out on a few things.  Oh, when he says he's got press conferences.  I gotta go, guys.  I got a big press conference in 15 minutes.  Oh, really, Kreskin?  Name some of the stations that are covering this. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, they're from all over, all over.  Kreskin, name one.  Right.  Oh, they're, you know, all the news agencies.  Guys, I gotta go.  I gotta go.  He's got nothing.  He would come in here with his TV makeup on.  He'd have TV makeup, and you know those tissues they put in your collar?  Yeah.  To keep the makeup from going from your neck to your collar?  He would wear those, and come in and go, Kreskin, what are you doing?  Oh, I got a press conference after this.  It's makeup.  You know how it is.  And you never see any of these things.  You never hear of them on the news.  Have you ever seen a Kreskin press conference ever? 
[00:52:00]  Never, ever.  I would like to challenge anybody out there to send us audio of a Kreskin press conference.  Right.  You will not find one.  He is a lying sack.  And he always came on the show saying that we're going to make worldwide attention together.  Oh, here it is.  This is going to be a huge story.  This is going to be huge for me and huge for you guys, because I'm doing it on your show,  and the press, they're just waiting outside.  We're going to do it on the radio.  Then I'm going downstairs, and I'm going to take questions from the media.  Kreskin, unless we send you to St. Pat's to fuck somebody, it ain't going to make the 
[00:52:30]  news.  Yeah, don't worry.  We'll do our worldwide thing ourselves.  We don't need you.  Don't worry about it, Kreskin.  Oh, we made something disappear that day.  Yeah.  You ass.  Our careers.  Right.  See, you guys thought we were thinking dirty, but Anthony turned it on you.  Right.  That's right.  All right.  Kreskin caused WOR in New York City to go off air.  Wow.  Radio Inc. reports that WOR went off air after Kreskin, an illusionist question mark, magician 
[00:53:00]  question mark, whatever question mark, used his mind to instill a big chill in the audience.  They went off the air after he shouted, chill out.  Chill out.  This is hip terminology.  Side note, the story claims this was WOR's first time being off the air.  Could that be?  Ooh.  Could that be?  I guess because of the heat wave, they had Kreskin come in, and he decided he was going 
[00:53:30]  to make everyone chill out.  I just noticed this is off of New York Radio Message Board.  Yeah.  I hate the fact that we're getting show prep off of New York Radio Message Board.  Yeah, but it's Kreskin.  Somebody's asinine post.  It's Kreskin, though.  Were there answers?  Was there somebody who could definitely tell you that WOR was off the air back in 1972?  I remember.  They know everything about anything.  Was Kreskin too dirty for Josh's taste?  That douchebag.  Those guys on the New York Radio Message Board, uber radio geeks. 
[00:54:00]  I would like to know.  The history of radio in New York.  If WOR was off the air, please tell me.  Thank you, Kevin Seeley.  Kevin L. Seeley.  Message Board asses.  So, obviously, this is just another dumb radio bit.  Oh, see, now, looking at it, reading it, I didn't realize where it was from.  I thought it was WOR television for some reason, which probably hasn't been called that in years. 
[00:54:30]  Right.  But I thought it was a TV thing he was doing.  Silly me thought Kreskin was actually on television and made the TV station go off the air.  He did another hack bit, basically.  So, it's a radio station.  Yes, of course they pulled the plug.  Hack bit.  It's been very, very, very hot here in New York City.  Kind of like a heat wave thing and went on the air and said he's going to make everyone chill out.  What was his bit?  Does anyone know what the actual bit is?  What the setup was?  What he said was going to happen?  Did he say the station was going to go off the air?  Did he say...  He said he wanted to instill a big chill in the audience to cool him off because it was so hot. 
[00:55:00]  And then he yelled, chill out.  And then the station went off.  Then the station went dark, as they like to say in the business.  It doesn't make sense, though.  How long was he off for?  It was probably...  The station.  They probably can't even commit to the bit on a lot of these radio asses, so they probably had it off the air for five seconds.  And the general manager was panicking and going, enough!  Turn it back on!  Turn it back on.  TSL.  Do you think Kreskin actually talked these guys into it with his spiel about this will make huge news? 
[00:55:30]  Of course.  Guys, it's going to be huge.  Of course.  And they're sitting around going, yeah.  They're getting all psyched in the whole Kreskin thing.  This is going to be great.  We'll go off the air.  The news will pick it up.  We'll get some press.  And right after that, Kreskin's like, all right, I got to go.  Now that we're back on the air and I brought this whole thing back together, I got to go on the street and take my questions from the media.  From the media.  Runs outside the studio there, and what does he get?  And management at OR are probably like, wait, we're getting nothing out of this. 
[00:56:00]  There's nobody outside.  Tanks for nothing.  Tanks for nothing.  When he runs out for the media, he's like a Brady boy seeking a surprise party.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.  So there's our old pal and what he's been up to lately.  Good old Kreskin.  What a douchebag.  Another hack bit.  Mentalist.  What are you, Kreskin?  Shut up.  And now, why don't you talk about the guy who really was a mentalist, like Jesus.  What are you, Christ? 
[00:56:30]  That's good.  Kreskin.  What are you, the book of Revelation?  That's how me and my friends talk.  That's very good, Jimmy.  That's right.  Joe in Florida.  Go ahead, Joe.  How you doing, boys?  Hi.  Hey.  A buddy of mine was doing a family tree with his family, right?  So his mom gives him a camera to take pictures of his life, you know, like what he does in  his daily routine and that type of thing.  So he's carrying around his camera for like a month and we're making fun of him. 
[00:57:00]  Anyway, he passes out at a party one night.  And we all take our dicks out, put it all in his face and take pictures with his camera.  Figuring, you know, he'll go develop a film later on.  Individually or at the same time, pull your dicks out and put it in his face?  Oh, there was like five, six dicks at one time, individually, you name it.  He just, he looked like, you know, it was rough.  So we take the pictures and we leave the camera with him.  Well, like six months go by and he says, hey, man, he goes, I got a problem.  I said, what's up?  He goes, I think I might be gay. 
[00:57:30]  I said, well, why do you say that?  He goes, well, my mom has that camera of mine and she went to go develop the pictures for  the family tree and she hands me this big stack of pictures with dicks on my face.  And now she's questioning me, wanting to know exactly what's going on in my life.  For the family tree?  Well, it was like.  Your story has holes in it.  Yeah, because first of all, why would he come to you and say, I think I'm gay?  Right.  Instead of just knowing I was asleep.  How do you not know you're asleep when your eyes are closed and there's dicks just hovering over you?  I mean, he was really like uber out there, man. 
[00:58:00]  He drinks like, uh.  I'm going to call Bravo Sierra.  Wow.  Oh, no way.  We rarely call Bravo Sierra.  Bravo Sierra.  Oh.  I got to call Bravo Sierra on this story.  You think it's bunk?  Yeah.  Come on, fess up.  It's a lie, right?  No, not at all.  It would give like insight on me.  He comes up to you and goes, I think I'm gay, but I'm not sure because of these pictures  that my mom developed for the family tree.  It was supposed to be some insight on his life, like picture of his job, what he does, his 
[00:58:30]  friends, that type of thing.  We didn't know it was his mom's camera, in other words.  Has anyone ever like done that family tree thing, by the way?  Hmm.  You discover that your family's just filled with like alcoholics and stuff.  With nothing?  With nothingness.  You're looking for some kind of greatness, some knight.  Yeah.  Or something, and it's just nothing.  Just nothing.  The bread cart guy during the plague.  My great, great, great grandfather was a bootlegger.  Oh, great.  You want like a pirate in your family or something cool?  Wasn't everyone a bootlegger back at the turn of the century? 
[00:59:00]  You'll get, you get nothing out of it.  What do you do a family tree with?  Huh?  What do you do to get a family tree with?  There's all kinds of software.  You go online and...  And you find out nothing.  You give them money and they tell you that, you know, a couple of dagos got on a boat and  came over here.  Right.  It's about the size of it.  Although our own Sam, the intern there, is related to Thomas Jefferson.  Thomas Jefferson, so he says.  So he says he brought in his family tree.  Oh, shit.  Where's mine? 
[00:59:30]  He brought in his family tree.  I can't read it.  Why weren't copies made?  Why don't I have a...  Why don't I have...  I am Sam.  Where is Sam?  This is his family tree?  Yeah.  Thanks, Hawk.  Thomas Jefferson.  What?  He went to get food.  He went to get food, so when...  Miles.  Miles Standish.  President Thomas Jefferson is our intern Sam's great, great, great, great, great, great  first cousin.  First cousin. 
[01:00:00]  How does it work?  This family tree is really stupid.  It's very confusing.  I can't read it.  There's numbers.  Miles Standish is his great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great,  great grandfather.  Who the hell was Miles Standish?  Miles Standish, the Mayflower.  What?  Came over on the Mayflower.  What, what, what, what?  He was the head muckety-muck.  All right.  On the Mayflower.  All righty.  Are you kidding me?  Wow, this guy's got some blood in him.  Is he Samuel Wood Roberts? 
[01:00:30]  Is that who he is?  Go to the beginning.  Because I see number one.  He's related to William the Conqueror, the King of England?  Stop it.  Where is that?  Number 31.  And then father.  Get out of here.  How could you have this many really cool people in your family?  Right.  This is not really.  I love this.  This guy comes from royalty and he's getting our, getting us our Starbucks coffee today.  William the Conqueror.  He comes from William the Conqueror and he's like conquering Starbucks. 
[01:01:00]  Hey, faggot, conquer that fat free muffin.  Wait on why with the rest of us.  Is William the Conqueror conquering?  Speaking of Miles, walk a few to get me a crispy apple, bitch.  I think we've got to give this Sam guy a little more respect.  Sam.  Jesus.  Samuel.  Yeah.  He's also related to George Harrison. 
[01:01:30]  Where's that?  The George Harrison?  The George Harrison where?  Number 10.  Or some other guy named George Harrison.  Well, I don't know.  It's somewhere between William the Conqueror and Thomas Jefferson.  It's also related to Mary Hart.  I think this is bullshit.  I think you paid money to have this done and if you pay money, you pay enough money, you'll  get good relatives.  You have to go to tiredofbeingazilch.com.  Right.  Yeah, you know, bring up a good point. 
[01:02:00]  If you're going to go down this road and you're going to pay people, you've got to think these  people are going to have to give you someone cool.  Yeah.  In your lineage.  Of course.  William the Conqueror.  King of England.  That's pretty cool.  Matilda of Germany.  All right.  Henry II, King of England.  Mm-hmm.  Pretty impressive.  Henry III.  Of course, you'd be related to all of them because they're all related.  Are they?  Yeah.  All right.  I want to get my family tree now.  This is exciting. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, that would be hilarious.  Sir and Baron Andrew Windsor.  Hmm.  A baron.  Here you go.  I know the Pierce's we were related to, they brought ice cream into Jersey City.  All right.  That's nobody.  No, that's pretty.  That's pretty.  John is calling us out on something here.  John, go ahead.  Hey, Opie.  You were dead on calling Bravo Sierra on that guy.  That dicks in the face thing is an old Sam Kinison bit.  Oh, that was?  Yeah.  It's on one.  If you listen to the comedy channel, they play it every now and then. 
[01:03:00]  It is, though, but it is something that people have done.  Shenanigans.  Yeah, it's probably something that people have done.  You guys got it.  You call them.  Talk to you later.  All right.  Bye.  Let's say hi to Liz.  Liz, she needs some advice on a colonoscopy.  Liz, what's up?  Hello?  We lost Liz?  All right.  I'm going to Liz.  Here's Sam.  I am Sam.  There he is.  What's up, Sam?  Hi, everybody.  You're not related to William the Conqueror. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Isn't he right at the top there?  I swear to God, that tree is legit.  That wasn't legit.  I swear to God.  We, on a family reunion a few years ago, they put out this book that, like, this big, thick  book that has all these trees laid out by all the divisions.  And my dad, who's now an avid listener, was listening the day that you guys had me on,  talking about, you know, bringing some Thomas Jefferson stuff or something.  So that day, he went through the book and actually typed that out. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, but it's confusing.  I know.  That's why I had to make the notes on it.  Now, I'm looking at this.  Is this, because I see mother of, father of, blah, blah, blah in the first column.  Yeah.  But then there's none of that here in the second column.  Where Thomas Jefferson is.  Right.  The second column is, the second, third, fourth columns are extended generation.  It seems to split after Peter Field Jefferson on both of those. 
[01:04:30]  And then goes to John Robert Jefferson.  So is this, like, maybe one side of the family and then the other side?  This is all my dad's side.  This is all your dad's side.  So, Thomas Jefferson II would be the grandfather, making the president, Thomas Jefferson, the first cousin. 
[01:05:00]  The great, great, great, great, great, great, great first cousin.  I'll say he is.  Roger Williams, founder of Rhode Island, is number 13.  That's pretty cool.  And now, Miles Standish.  Yeah.  That, this looks like a pretty straightforward family tree thing here.  Right.  He would be the grandfather, the great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great.  So, now, Miles Standish is the father of Josias Standish.  Is that what I'm...  Yeah, that's what it looks like. 
[01:05:30]  And then that's the father of Mercy Standish, the father of Mary Well, Wheelock.  Yes.  Wheelock.  They had great names back then.  What did you earn the last name?  I don't know.  Looks at a Wheelock.  Wheelock.  You just pick them.  And then that, that, that, and then it goes to your father and you.  Right.  Wow.  That's pretty impressive.  That's it.  That's the way the tree...  And, uh...  I feel bad that you're getting our stuff for us.  Really?  They were looking for black blood in there somewhere. 
[01:06:00]  And my mom was, uh...  Because it's not there, you know, because Thomas Jefferson is a cousin, so it's not his blood.  Yeah.  It's not...  So, uh, my mom was trying to go through her family tree, but my mom's family gets a little  shady at points, so they can't exactly trace back...  More ways than one.  There's a lot of shade on her side.  They can't trace it all the way, uh, back terribly far.  Well, that's why I'm amazed that you get this far back with a family tree, because I know  I could probably go back to my great-grandfather, and then it would just get lost in some vendetta 
[01:06:30]  somewhere in Sicily.  It gets really shady after those trips to Oakland.  That's very cool, Sam.  But, yeah, that's the truth.  Do you have any memorabilia from these people?  Uh, no, I mean, there's got to be something somewhere in the family, and...  William the Conqueror's sword or something?  Wouldn't that be cool?  If I can find anything at all, I will absolutely bring it in.  Do you see any paintings of William the Conqueror?  No.  What did he look like?  Was he a big fella?  I have no clue. 
[01:07:00]  My dad handed me that, and he's like, yeah, no.  I would so be researching William the Conqueror.  Died in 1087.  What did he do?  What did he conquer?  Well, Bill, um, he was, uh, he was better known as, uh, Duke of Normandy, actually.  Is that it?  He was William the Bastard.  His rule was stern.  Ah, tell him, Fred.  My rule was stern.  It's laced with, uh, faced with many battles.  The most famous was October 14th, 1066. 
[01:07:30]  He led the Normans to defeat the English forces in the celebrated Battle of Hastings.  Wow.  On Christmas Day, he was crowned the King of England in the famed Westminster Abbey.  Wow.  This guy was like, uh, the real deal.  Oh, yeah.  An, an OG.  Are you allowed to just...  Like a real OG.  Are you allowed to just go to the Westminster Abbey and say, hey, I'm related to the dude?  You know, I've never tried, but I gotta assume, yeah, I'll just bring the tree.  That little printout.  That would be, like, pretty good.  You're, you're royalty.  I, um, fast forward a thousand years. 
[01:08:00]  You know, who was, who was, uh, young Sam the intern?  Oh, this is...  Here he would get muffins and coffee for a man with...  How do you do?  I'm Sam.  This is pretty, uh, rude.  The twisted part of William the Conqueror's death.  He died September 9th, 1087, at the age of 60 years old.  Within minutes, the servant stole everything from his residence, including his clothes, 
[01:08:30]  and left his swollen, lifeless body naked on the floor.  That's where you get the black...  Oh!  There.  There you go.  There's your proof, buddy.  An obscure knight named Harloon was the first to discover William's nude body.  At his own expense, he was not a wealthy man.  He arranged for the body to be prepared for the funeral and transported to Cain.  Just before the solemn funeral procession reached the church, the cries of fire were heard. 
[01:09:00]  The mourners were forced to put his coffin down and go fight a fire.  Eventually, they put the fire out, returned to the body, and continued along its way to the church.  The funeral was held on a blisteringly hot day.  As a result, his abscess had swelled and became putrid.  When they tried to fit William's body into a custom-made sarcophagus,  they found out it had swelled so much it wouldn't fit in.  What to do?  They squeezed him in.  They tried to push him to no avail.  Then they pushed his swollen abdominal wall, 
[01:09:30]  and William the Conqueror's body burst like a popped balloon.  The pus and putrefaction drenched the king's burial garb.  The stench filled the chapel.  The mourners raced for the door, their hands covering their noses.  Needless to say, they buried him very quickly.  That's Grandpa.  Yeah, that's it.  He said what happened was he got thrown a horse through him onto the saddle's iron pommel,  which is that big knob on the front. 
[01:10:00]  And his injuries were internal.  The saddle burst his intestines, and waist matter began to fill and poison his intestines.  Is that what happens?  Yeah, no, I was riding, and the horn of the saddle went up my ass.  Yeah, I swear, I was on a horse.  You go to the doctor with the saddle up your ass?  Pantitis.  Hmm.  Well, very good, Sam.  He couldn't fix that, I guess, back then.  There was no surgery.  He was constantly ridiculed for being a fat man.  Huh.  You're a skinny guy. 
[01:10:30]  Sure am.  That's right.  I'll take after William the Conqueror.  No, sir.  So you think when the servants kind of raided the place, there's that one relative who was slow,  and then there was Kathy with a limp.  Aha!  I see where the tree split.  Wow, that's some family trade.  Cool, man.  Congratulations.  Let's go to Blake in South Carolina.  Blake!  Hey, man, how you doing?  Pretty good, Blake.  Now, listen here, I'm related to Anus Khan, because any asshole goes on to some site trying  to find out who their relatives are, going to find out they're related to somebody famous, 
[01:11:00]  somebody important, and ask William there if he's got any memorabilia from his uncle,  maybe some chains that he tied up his aunt with to make her impregnated.  Hmm.  Hmm?  Oh, dear Lord.  Oh, boy.  Thank you, Blake.  What's this?  Thanks, Steve.  What are you handing out here?  I just thought it was interesting that he has a relative called Robert the Magnificent. 
[01:11:30]  No.  Did you?  You thought this was interesting?  Magnificent!  Hold on.  Steve, grab that mic.  This is very interesting.  Can Steve read this?  I think this is interesting.  Oh, give me a break.  I highlighted it this fucking time.  I don't care.  You said it was interesting.  Go ahead.  There you go.  Sorry.  William the Conqueror, or actually William I, was King of England from 1066 to 1087,  known alternatively as William of Normandy, William the Conqueror, and William the Bastard.  He was also the illegitimate and only son of Robert the Magnificent.  Slow down, because this interesting stuff is going right in and out of people's ears. 
[01:12:00]  Because I'm reading too fast?  Yes.  Sorry.  Why is this interesting?  Okay, fine.  Maybe it's not interesting.  No, why was it interesting to you?  That's all.  Because he...  It actually extends the family tree beyond what...  Yeah, it extends the family tree, and he was...  I just thought it was...  I thought the actual name of Robert the Magnificent was the interesting part.  How do you get that name?  I don't know.  That's...  You've got to do something, I guess, magnificent.  No, for Bob Kelly, he's Robert the Fat.  And how about this? 
[01:12:30]  No authentic portrait of William has ever been found.  Oh.  In the patriotic print, he's wearing plate armor.  And no, so I guess you wouldn't get any paintings or portraits to see what he looked like.  Yeah, but that's not an authentic portrait.  That looks like a king on a card.  That looks like the king of spades or something.  He always had a big red king next to him.  Big red king.  Oh, boy.  Almost.  All right, we're going to move on.  Thank you, Sam.  Thank you, Sam.  Thank you for bringing in the family tree. 
[01:13:00]  My pleasure.  Proving that you're related to Thomas Jefferson.  That name sounds like royalty.  Are you royalty?  He is royalty.  Yes.  Now go get our Starbucks.  How do you do?  I'm Sam.  I'm Sam.  He sounds just like that.  All right, we're going to go to break.  As we go to break, you know what we should do?  The Cartman...  The Cartman.  Why do I keep saying that?  The Cartman.  Cartman.  And Cartman tells the aristocrat joke.  The movie, by the way, we've been talking about it off and on all week, is getting three  and a half stars in the New York papers today. 
[01:13:30]  Mm-hmm.  And I hope to see it right after the show today.  I can't wait.  But I think it's going to be just a nightmare trying to get in.  Because I think they're only showing it at like one theater in New York City.  That's crazy.  You're open.  You'll get in.  Well, yeah, right.  We'll try.  Anyway, but as we go to break, we'll do Cartman doing the aristocrat's joke, Anthony.  All right.  Basically, this old-time joke.  The joke itself is like whatever, but everyone interprets it differently.  Very simple joke. 
[01:14:00]  Mm-hmm.  And this is Cartman's version.  You guys want to hear a funny joke my grandpa told me?  No.  Okay.  So this family walks into a talent agency.  It's a mother, father, their son and daughter, and a little baby.  The father says to the talent agent,  Sir, our family has an amazing act.  We know if you would let us perform it for you, you would want to sign us.  And the talent agent says,  Sorry, we don't sign family acts.  They're too cutesy.  But then the mother goes,  Please, sir, if you just give us two minutes, we know you'll like our act.  So the talent agent says,  All right, you've got two minutes.  The family jumps right into it.  The mother smiles and points to the son who hits play on a boombox. 
[01:14:30]  Thrilling circus music starts to play as the father spins his daughter  around, bends her over, lifts up her skirt, and starts licking her asshole.  What?  Then the son lays down on the floor and opens his mouth,  and the mother tears off tear-away pants,  squats down over his face, and starts shitting all over him.  Dude!  Hold on, hold on.  The father grabs the baby, takes off his diaper, and starts sucking his cock, right?  While the son, still with his mother's shit in his mouth,  goes over and licks the baby's tiny little balls.  Dude.  Hold on, cop.  Now the mother lays down on her back on the floor,  while the daughter gets up high on a chair and starts pissing all over her.  Then the father and son take the baby and start stuffing it headfirst back into the mother's vagina, 
[01:15:00]  while the daughter's piss rains down on all of them.  Dude, just stop.  They get the baby halfway in so that just his legs are sticking out all kicking and flailing around.  The son takes the mother's shit out of his mouth and starts rubbing it all over everyone,  while the father sticks his cock in the baby's asshole and fucks it while it's still inside the mother,  until he comes all over the baby, the wife, and the son, and the daughter.  Cartman, I don't want to...  Cock!  Will you hold on, please?  Then the father gets up and says,  and now for our impersonation of the victims of 9-11,  and the whole family starts running around the room screaming and laughing with their dicks and titties all slapping around,  covered with shit and piss and cum, going, 
[01:15:30]  and finally the family runs back to the center of the room and goes,  Ta-da!  And the tally agent, he just sits there for the longest time.  And finally he says,  Jesus, that's a hell of an act.  What do you call it?  And the father says,  The aristocrats.  I don't get it.  The virus is spreading.  The virus is inside us.  O-A-Virus.com 
[01:16:00]  Assault the media.  It's time to drop bombs.  We're just pests.  You can't exterminate with black flag.  Your webpage just got hijacked by whack bag.  The gag order's gone.  Time to go to war.  Steve sees napalm burning down your door.  It's hardcore.  Apart from whores you dump on Norton's belly.  The only other girl in this life is Bob Kelly.  Not you.  When he was a kid, he sucked cop too.  These two obnoxious shock jocks might shock you.  Ass coward.  He don't want to get involved.  Slip in your PJs and light a Java log. 
[01:16:30]  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Let's say hi to Ken in Michigan. 
[01:17:00]  Ken, what's going on today?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hi, Ken.  Hey, I'm just out here waiting for fuel to come.  Combining, finishing up combining wheat.  Well, we just got this combine.  It's got XM in it.  I thought you guys were great.  He's got his combine.  I don't understand where you city slickers are coming from, though.  A lot of the stuff's a little bit over my head, though.  Oh, yeah?  You're listening to the show for the first time?  Yep. 
[01:17:30]  Yep.  In a combine, Opie.  Yep.  John Deere sitting out here in the field.  We got the combine here, and they give us a year of subscription free, but I'm sure  as hell, as soon as the old man finds out what's on here, he'll probably end up canceling  on us.  Is it a brand new combine?  No, it's a used one.  Slightly used.  9610.  And how did it get XM in there for free, Fred?  The dealer put it in for us when we bought it.  Oh.  So, it's kind of nice.  I kind of like it, but so far, I found out your show would be the most amusing when 
[01:18:00]  we're sitting out here in the field all day.  He's sitting in a field of wheat.  Yeah, come in, and we've got about 250 acres to go, and we're done.  You have so much to learn, bro.  You have no idea what this show's about yet.  It's pretty cool.  I heard you.  I've been listening for you about four days now.  Oh, okay.  So, it's pretty cool.  Oh, thank you.  I appreciate it.  Glad you like it.  And you guys keep up the good work.  How hot is it there where you are?  Right now, it's about 75.  You're supposed to get some monster rain or no?  We did there the first part of the week, but not now. 
[01:18:30]  It's not drying out now enough to start going again.  Do you get a lot of monster rain there or no?  No, we don't.  Actually, this has been a dry summer.  It's been a real dry summer.  All the corn's kind of...  All the crops are going to take a pretty bad hurt in this year.  Can you guys get those java logs out there?  Those what?  The java logs.  Everyone knows what a java log is.  Jesus.  What the hell is a java log?  It's like it's made from a certain kind of tree, and it petrifies a little bit, and it  actually burns slower. 
[01:19:00]  That's right.  Oh, I don't know what that is.  I'm not...  Sorry, I can't help you out there.  Dude, are you actually on a farm?  Yeah.  I live and work on a farm.  Wow, you got that John Candy laugh to you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You heard that?  My friend Ben had a farm.  He had a really big hog.  Do you have hogs?  No, we don't have hogs.  We got dairy cattle.  We have cows every morning and night, and, you know, never been out of the state of Michigan.  No?  I always wonder what New York would be like.  That's fun. 
[01:19:30]  Sounds like it would be a pretty cool place.  It depends.  If you're in Michigan, I mean, Detroit is probably, you know, I mean, that's a major city.  Oh, I've been to Detroit, and that sucks.  Do you guys have Ben's hogs there, or just smaller pigs?  How's that one you got?  We got some pretty good-sized hogs out here, that's for sure.  I love the John Candy laugh.  I can't get enough of that.  Are you a big fella?  Me?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, I'm about 290.  So you swallow a lot of aggression with, along with a lot of, a lot of, a lot of, I'm a corn-fed farm boy. 
[01:20:00]  All right.  Well, have fun harvesting.  Hey, no problem.  Thanks for the call.  You guys keep up an excellent show.  Thank you, sir.  And maybe someday I'll get out to New York City, see what all them city speakers do for a living.  You do that.  Drive the combine.  Bye, mister.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  There he goes.  Ken in Michigan.  Getting fans every day, Anthony.  I don't think I've ever spoken to anybody that actually drove a combine.  Yeah.  Oh.  All right.  Harvesting. 
[01:20:30]  You want to play the Iron Sheik audio?  Mm-hmm.  I guess they, uh, they do a Wrestling Hall of Fame.  I guess they inducted, uh, Hulk Hogan.  Oof.  I saw, like, a preview for one of his upcoming celeb reality shows that he's doing with his  brother.  Daughter.  It's an awful, awful show, but, uh, they talk about him being inducted into the Wrestling  Hall of Fame.  Wrestling Hall of Fame.  I could care less about the Hulk being inducted into the Wrestling Hall of Fame.  I got grease on me or something. 
[01:21:00]  From something.  Uh-oh.  Ew.  Smell it.  Ew.  What is it?  I don't know.  It smells like grease, but I, I just took a leak and washed my hands, so.  You probably bumped something.  You probably bumped something.  One of the interns probably touched his tongue.  Shut up.  And then touched the doorway.  Smell it.  Smell it.  It smells like grease, though.  Exactly.  It smells like, like, grease from, oh.  It's from the mic stand.  No, it's not.  Yes, it is.  It's from this.  It's the microphone thing, so it doesn't creak. 
[01:21:30]  All right.  Calm down.  It'll be all right.  You remember when I asked him in Washington, put some grease on there and they wouldn't  because it was white?  I don't care.  You got white all over it now.  On this one, not the one in D.C.  No, in D.C.  they won't put grease on there because it's white.  I don't, look, I don't care.  I'm not crazy.  I don't care.  This is annoying me.  There's no end.  He's got grease on his neck.  He doesn't care.  He's saying.  Let's say hi to Mike in California. 
[01:22:00]  Mike, what's up?  Hi, Mike.  Mikey.  Mike.  Mike.  Fuck.  I'm punching him.  He didn't even make it that far.  All right.  Anyway, the Iron Sheik was also inducted into the wrestling hall of fame.  I didn't Sheik.  You want to explain?  Well, we got to play that damn thing again.  We went off on a 20-minute tangent yesterday.  Iron Sheik came in.  He's another one of our friends.  We love when this guy comes by the program. 
[01:22:30]  Yes.  He makes no sense whatsoever.  He just recites stuff.  Just recites stuff.  He just has like a line that he says about how he's from Iran, greatest city in the world.  He won the championship.  Opian Anthony.  You can't say Opian Anthony.  And he just goes on and on.  Right.  After we have celebrities on the show, we send them down the hall to Steve's production room.  And Steve gets what's called a celebrity ID from these guys.  ID. 
[01:23:00]  It's supposed to take seconds.  Could you just say?  It's supposed to take seconds.  He was in there for quite a while.  You name the show.  You name your name.  Hi, this is blah, blah, blah.  You're listening to Opian Anthony on XM Satellite Radio.  Boom.  Four seconds.  And it's supposed to make us look important or something when you hear these things.  Oh, when you hear celebrities mentioning our name, it's supposed to make us look like,  wow, these guys are big time.  They're big time.  That's why they do it.  They got celebrity friends. 
[01:23:30]  They hang out with them all the time, obviously.  We're better than the other station because we have these celebrities that say our name.  Right.  And how come the same celebrities, you hear them saying,  and I listen to, and you're listening to, and when I'm in town, I listen to.  But then they're on other stations saying the same thing.  Right.  I think they're fibbing.  Hold on a second.  Go ahead, Rose.  Hello?  Hi, Rose.  Yeah, hi.  Hi.  I wanted to tell Opie that he always says I could care less,  when actually it's I couldn't care less, and it drives me crazy. 
[01:24:00]  I could care less.  Even though technically you're right, that's just something that people do say.  It's like one of those little things in the language that's probably.  Yeah, it's one of those things that kind of, it means it both ways.  Yeah.  Jimmy, I saw you in Baltimore at the improv.  I'm in love with you.  Thank you.  I could care less.  How fat are you?  I'm not fat at all, actually.  Are you pretty?  Yes, I am.  Because I'm lonely.  I'm married, though.  That's the only problem. 
[01:24:30]  I was there with my husband.  I need a birthday date.  It's not your birthday.  Well, I'll definitely go with you.  That's not a problem.  And I'm sure my husband won't have a problem with it, because he's a fan of the show.  Thank you.  All right, Rose.  What do I do again so I can correct myself?  Well, you always say I could care less, but that means you care a lot, so it's I couldn't  care less.  I don't care.  I don't care.  My jokes don't go over.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  He does not care. 
[01:25:00]  I don't care.  Thank you, Rose.  No, I didn't say Iran is a city.  I said the Iron Sheik says he's from Iran and from greatest city in the world.  I was quoting him.  People are getting really picky now.  I understand where it comes from.  We goof on each other about our speech and what we say and things like cities.  A lot of people saying you said country is city.  Oh, wait.  Here it is.  Let me go to...  Terran Aran.  Donnie from Louisiana.  Donnie.  Go ahead, Donnie. 
[01:25:30]  I'm going to ask Anthony what country is the city of Iran to be in.  If it came off like that, I apologize, but it certainly wasn't meant that way.  The Iron Sheik says he's from Terran Aran.  Terran Aran.  Greatest city in world.  New York City.  Madison Square Garden.  He babbles.  That's what he says.  I wasn't giving a fucking geography lesson.  So basically...  Ass head.  Most celebrities give a quick four-second celebrity ID.  Yeah.  And the Iron Sheik is so out there that he came up with this mess. 
[01:26:00]  Hit it, Er.  This is Iron Sheik, World Wrestling Federation, three-time champion,  All-American AAU champion.  It's a pleasure for me today.  Anthony and I hope you bring me here to New York.  I say hello to all my wrestling fans.  And everybody knows I'm the real Middle Easterman.  Come to the greatest wrestling country and most famous city in the world.  Manhattan Madison Square Garden. 
[01:26:30]  I come three-time champion.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans.  Especially all-American.  And also my Iranian friend.  A pleasure for me to come back here again one more time to talk to the Opie and Anthony.  And pleasure for me always.  It was supposed to be, I'm the Iron Sheik, you're listening to Opie and Anthony on XM Satellite Radio 
[01:27:00]  Do you hear in the background, wait, was that, are there people talking over, because you can hear Ben laughing in the beginning  Really?  Yeah, play the beginning, just the beginning  Ben's cackling  Of course he's cackling  It's like 10 seconds, you can hear it  This is Iron Sheik, World Wrestling Federation, three-time sampling, All-American AAU  Ben's cackle  The Iron Sheik was doing coke, I said, it wasn't  Alright, anyway, they inducted the Iron Sheik into the Wrestling Hall of Fame 
[01:27:30]  Yeah  And he pretty much did the same babble  This was broadcast on WWE, is that what they did, where did this come from?  Off the DVD  Off the DVD  Oh, very important event  They didn't have time to throw this on live TV  Alright  Listen to this  Thank you very much for all my intelligent wrestling fans, run the world, especially Los Angeles, California

I got some bang snaps and some whippersnappers 
[01:31:30]  I don't know why Dumb bought those  He's a dumbass  What's that, Dumb?  They gave them to me for free  They just threw them in the bag  When I bought them  I was going to say  Dumb is so dumb  He's like  Dude, maybe we can like  Put these in his ears or something  Blam his head up against the wall  So they're going to do something with firecrackers?  I don't know  It's like the video  The guy's trapped into his chest  Have you forgot?  I have a broken rib  I mean, that could be easily infected 
[01:32:00]  There's already problems  I'm not going to have full go here  And this is just  This is like overboard, man, today  I mean, this is seriously overboard  This is  It's like playing with gunpowder  It's a bomb  I'm going to test one of them  I'm going to test one of these off here  Kevin, good morning  You're on Rover's Morning Glory  Hey, what's up, bro?

[01:49:30]  Iron Schick  Can't come in?  But he's very entertaining though  Champ when  Let's go to Tom  In Edison, New Jersey  Tom  Boys what's going on?  Hey  Oy  First time calling  Long time listener  What's with this  Mushroom off  I can't talk  You think it's a  Momentary loss  Of muscular coordination?  Very good  Bravo  Eric in  Oklahoma  What's up Eric?  Hey there  Did the Iron Schick  After he was talking 
[01:50:00]  About his kid's name  Did he say something  About his finger?  Fire  Does he say finger  During that?  It sounded like  He said finger  Finger  Very good  Let's go to Craig  In Tennessee  Craig  Yeah I was just saying  That the Sheik  Sounds like the end  Of every one of  Dice's jokes  Oh  Yeah he's  He's screaming  Mad man  Alright Liz is back  She needs advice  On her  Colonoscopy  Hi  Hello  Hi Liz 
[01:50:30]  Oh hi  Colonoscopy  That's getting  Colin Quinn  Out of your ass  I want to tell  Jimmy that I had  The upper GI  Endoscopy  And it only lasts  Like five minutes  But definitely  Take drugs  Because if you don't  You feel like  You're choking to death  And I wanted to know  If any of the  Female listeners  Out there  Had to go to a doctor  With pubic  Totally shaved  And what kind of  Reaction they get  Because  You know  I go to a gynecologist  I've got to let it  Grow back  And now  I have to get  A colonoscopy  In September  And I've got to  Grow back again  And if I didn't 
[01:51:00]  I just wanted to see  If I could get feedback  On what  Why do you feel like  You have to grow  Your pubic hair back  Because you're going  To the doctor  It's kind of  Embarrassing  I mean  The reaction  There was a girl  Who was sitting  In the gynecologist  Office  And said that  Her doctor had retired  And there was a new  Young doctor  And she said to him  Well if you've seen  One you've seen  Them all  And he said  No sweetheart  Everyone is different  And then I went  Back to him again  It freaked her out  You don't want the  Gyno saying that  But I think the  Doctors at this  Point are used to  Seeing a lot of 
[01:51:30]  Girls with shaved  Bushes there  I think a lot of  Them do grow  Back when they go  Do you think  Girls just grow  Back before they  Go to their doctor  Get a little  Stubble in there  Really  Yeah I think  I do every year  When I go to  The gynecologist  I grow back  Like a month  Beforehand  You know why  It's hot  It's sexy  And you don't  Want anything hot  Or sexy  In front of the  Gyno  Oh you might be  On to something  I don't think  The girls want  So you think  These girls are  Growing it back  To make it look  As ugly as possible  Yeah they want  To ugly up the  Snatch a little  So the doctor  Doesn't do anything 
[01:52:00]  Inappropriate  So the doctor  Just gets down  To business  Stays professional  Instead of looking  At it like  Oh my god  I need to get  In that snatch  Right  He doesn't lose  Control  Right  You're on him  Concentrating to make  Sure everything's  All right  Down there  Yeah  You know Liz  You might be  On to something  Yeah  I'm thinking  Why bother  But yeah  Maybe you gotta  Ugly it up  Yeah  Definitely  You know  I mean  A reaction like  That  I know  Everyone is  Different  You know  I mean  Kind of makes  You a little  Uncomfortable  Yeah  I want to say  Happy unbirthday  To Jimmy  It's my birthday  Unbirthday  All right Liz 
[01:52:30]  Thank you  I'll punch you out  Bye  Let's go to Mike  In Jersey  Mike what's up  Hey what's going on guys  I just had a story  About the gay thing before  Oh yeah  Hold on hold on  We got new listeners  Tuning in right now  We're doing a little thing  All day today  Called gay or just plain funny  So you got a story  Yeah this is my story  I was kind of like  My buddy had fallen asleep  He didn't pass out  He was just laying  Against the couch  I'll say by your voice  That it's gay  His lesson  He's sleeping on the floor  And me and this girl  Kind of start going at it  On that couch  And he's asleep 
[01:53:00]  Yeah  But one thing leads to another  We both end up  Getting fucking naked  And during  During this whole thing  You know  I'm sure my ass  Is brushing against his head  Maybe my balls  Get a little bit close  I've  More story short  I end up taking her  To the bathroom  And finishing her off  But the first part  Of it  What do you think  My ass on his head  While I'm fucking this girl  Again  Not gay  Also not funny  You're just bragging sir  Another braggart  Another braggart  On the show  Wanting to say  How he's pounded some girl 
[01:53:30]  We hate braggarts  Punch it out boys  Alright  It's not gay  Of course  You have a girl  Involved there  And you gotta do  The quiet sex  When you're in  A room with others  Other people  Try to keep it quiet  Real quiet  It's like just  In the middle of the night  Room is completely dark  There's other people  Sleeping in the room  And all you occasionally hear  Is  You try to be quiet  You breathe like that 
[01:54:00]  Then you realize  You're being noisy  And then occasionally  Gotta be quiet  And you're having  A slumber party  Because everyone  Was too drunk  To drive home  Yeah  And you're in the corner  Trying to have quiet sex  Gotta do the slow  Shallow thrust  I don't like this guy  Where you got your 
[01:54:30]  Hairy man ass  On the other guy  Because he wants  Complete control  He's rubbing his bag  Against his friend's  Farhead as he's pounding  Jeez dude  A little courtesy  Yeah sure  Let's say hi to Chris  Who's a girl  Chris what's up  Girl  Yeah  I wanted to make a comment  For that lady there  Yeah  I keep it shaved  I don't care  I just do all  Different styles  I don't care  What the doctor thinks  Yeah  I just wanted to tell her  That I just keep it normal  I don't you know  I always keep it short  I'll do it bald 
[01:55:00]  It doesn't matter  Alright  Whatever I'm in the mood  That day  Some girl's a little  A little embarrassed  I think  Alright we got  We got another story  From Tim on Long Island  Tim go ahead  Yeah I got a  Football hazing story  To tell you about  Gay  I'm just saying  Right now  Right now gay  Does it involve  Pinecones  And 16 year old boys  Well it's not  Far from that  It's close  Alright  I went to high school  Up in New Hampshire  Spalding High School  In New Hampshire  Spalding  Yeah  What's that 
[01:55:30]  Nothing  Continue  We actually used to do  A contest called  Mr. Spalding  Where we used to  You know  Strip down  To just our jock straps  And they'd stick  A record up your ass  And you had to run  An obstacle course  With that record  Stuck up your ass  Actually sorry  That's called  The record race  Gay  It's not gay  It's not gay  We did it in front  Of cheerleaders  No  It's gay  In front of cheerleaders  In front of cheerleaders  Man  There was the other  Part of the team  Dressed like cheerleaders  But they were cheerleaders  Picture  Picture 
[01:56:00]  Six, five  Three hundred pounds  Running around  With a record  Stuck up your ass  You know why it's gay  Because someone  Had to come up with it  And no one  Comes up with that  Unless there's  Something gay going on  But it's a guy  That was on the team  Back in the 70's  No one even has a  Gay  Has a connection  With that guy anymore  Who continues  The tradition  It gets worse  It gets worse  I had a friend  His name is Kevin  We actually played  A trick on him  He's got a joke  Doing the team  Trying to play tricks  On everybody  So we got him back  We actually took  That atomic bomb  And put it on the record 
[01:56:30]  And he didn't know  About it  Because he's blindfolded  When we shoved it  Up his ass  So we shoved the record  Up his ass  And made him do it  With atomic bomb  The kid couldn't sit down  Right for a week  Atomic bomb sir  Yeah it's like  It heats up  When it gets wet  Oh  Atomic bomb  Bomb  B-A-L-M  Right  Right  Catchy  Oh man it was  The poor kid  Couldn't sit right  For a week  I still feel bad  To it to this day  It's like Ben Gay  Or something  I would guess  Exactly  Ben Gay  He's probably listening  Right now  Sorry Kevin  If you're listening  I'm sorry  I think it was your 
[01:57:00]  Attempt to be funny  But it wasn't funny  At all  No no it's a true story  It really happened  No I understand  It's a true story  But it's not gay  In my opinion  And it's not funny  Alright I suck  Punch it out  Wah wah wah wah  It's a little too wacky  To be walking around  With a record  Up your ass  Lisa  Yes  You're a nurse  Yeah I'm a labor  And delivery nurse  Alright  And this is in response  To that caller  Who was concerned  About shaving her bush  When she goes to the doctor  We actually prefer  When the patient 
[01:57:30]  Is shaved  Because when they come in  And they're not shaved  We're just like  Oh we gotta shave this  This is a mess  Down here  You shave it  Yeah  When they're having a baby  Hey hello  She panicked on us  Did she panic  Or something happened  With her phone  I think she might have  Panicked on us  One more here  Herschel in Louisiana  Herschel  Yeah  What's up Herschel  I got a question  For you  Whether this was  Gay  Or whether I was  About to get mugged 
[01:58:00]  I was in a  Restroom in Denver  A little pilot  And I'm sitting there  At the damn stall  And I noticed  This Mexican guy  Walking behind me  As he walks past me  He kind of peeks over  Yeah  I was like oh shit  So I hurry up  And haul ass  Over to the sink  You know  I'm washing my hands  And then the same guy  Comes over there  While I'm washing my hands  And ask me if I'm alone  Huh  And ask you if you're alone  I've got a curious 
[01:58:30]  Yeah  Ask me if I'm alone  So he was either gonna  Try to have sex with you  Or mug you  Yeah  It's a combination  He was gonna put his dick  In your ass  And then mug you  Of your T-cells  I don't know man  Cause he was Mexican  I don't know about that  Yeah  I ain't never seen  A Mexican fag  So I didn't know  If I was about to get mugged  Or whether he was  Ditting on me  God  Uncut burrito  I gotta be honest here  I don't know which way to go  He was hitting on you  Muggers don't ask if you're alone  Yeah  Not in the bathroom  Yeah alright

[02:28:30]  From what?  That's some guy from Vermont  First of all  We never abuse comics on this show  I'm very weird with other comics  But I didn't even know the guy was a comic  When the book came in  And I could  You know whatever  You gotta  You gotta shit on people  I think his book got a lot of exposure  Oh my god  It got huge  It got huge exposure  And actually there's a guy  Even through all that  And this is  What we accomplished today  Chris the trucker  Go ahead  Uh yeah  I was gonna know  I liked the book  I was gonna know where I could get it at  You can get it 
[02:29:00]  I'll be honest  We'll plug it  You can get it off  It sounds like a very intelligent book  I mean  What moron couldn't write that  What kind of stuff  Oh boy  So you can grab this if you wanted to  It's off eatabullet.com  Um  You go to the merchandise section  And there's like a little  A thing called  Trinkets I own  Made from Gorilla Hands  It comes in that packet  Alright  That's cool  So I mean  Any Negro can write  Right  Is that what you're trying to say  Oh my god  You are bombing  Horrifically  Thank you  With that we're gonna take a break

[02:30:00]  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[02:30:30]  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony program. 
[02:31:00]  A bunch of people giving us some shit over that last segment because we're making fun  of a comic.  Shouldn't a comic be the one that understands?  Should have a little bit of a sense of humor.  The guy had not a sense of humor.  He didn't want to hang and have fun.  Come on.  I would have to laugh at the angle we took.  We're goofing.  If I was a comic, I'd have to laugh at the angle someone takes on my book like that. 
[02:31:30]  If he would have handled it a certain way, and I'm very good with other comics, but I  never shit out of comics.  I just know.  It's a weird thing.  But, you know, like when he said something, he said something that was got a great laugh.  He had one really funny one.  If he would just go with it, and it's like, all right, whatever.  I've got to tool on it a bit.  At the end, it would have been like, ah, this guy's cool.  If you want the book, just re-go for it.  Sounds like he takes himself a little too seriously.  Yeah.  It's like, relax.  You know, the book will do all right.  It'll be a, I don't know, a nice goof to buy for people. 
[02:32:00]  Someone said his act is reminiscent of Dennis Leary.  Oh, really?  So he might have that too-cool-for-the-room attitude.  I don't know.  I never saw him, so I don't know.  He could be the funniest guy ever.  I don't know.  What do I know?  All right, this guy, uh...  Are you making PB&Js?  Yeah.  You actually have the peanut butter jelly and slices of bread out there. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  It looks so good.  Not the sandwich, that shirt.  One of these days, you have to just check your bank account balance.  Why?  I don't know.  You're bringing in peanut butter jelly and bread.  Yeah.  It's nice.  What, just because I'm a millionaire, I'm not supposed to eat peanut butter and jelly?  I don't know.  It just seems a little odd, that's all.  Well, dude, I've been with you for ten years.  You're starting to figure out that I may be a little odd?  Oh, God.  Does that look like the inside of a diaper? 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, it really does.  Oh, that peanut butter is awful.  It's slimy and chunky.  Someone spilled a colonic all over your bread.  Jimmy pointed out to us, actually, it's the best story of the day, this guy that spent  $40,000 on prostitution, and he had no idea if that's the best part of the story.  So he's saying, something's going on.  What's the story, Jim?  I've got to make the sandwich.  The sandwich?  I'm making sandwiches.  I'm going to make a sandwich. 
[02:33:30]  Well, I have to see which paper this was in now, because I forget.  Oh, here you go, Jimmy.  You can have my copy.  Oh, Opie, you're so prepared.  There you go.  Also, on the way, we're going to do it today.  News teases.  Oh, I love the news teases.  Silly news teases on the way on the Open Energy Program.  One of my favorite segments we ever do, ever, ever.  We do it like once a week, and today is the day.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  This is his $40,000 Escort tab.  This guy went to some club, and he thinks that they drugged him. 
[02:34:00]  Uh-oh.  Because he woke up, and he got two credit card bills for $20,000 each.  Oh.  And he obviously was drugged, and he said,  I don't really have any of this highlighted, so.  That's all right.  Just read it at your leisure.  Yeah, just read it.  We could have Andrew read it.  If it can happen to Lenny.  Yeah, you know what, Andrew?  Take charge.  Was he at a strip club?  Yeah, some place.  They know that happens at strip clubs.  Yeah, but then they went back to his place, 
[02:34:30]  and the doorman thought that he was just having a party up there  with seven or eight girls.  There was like the one prostitute or lady of the evening,  what have you, went back with him, I guess,  and then called her friends.  So goes back, calls her friends,  shows up at this guy's apartment.  Mmm, mmm, mmm.  Is that a good peanut butter and jelly?  Oh, sorry.  I'll bet you it was eight girls,  and he said, how much?  And she said five grand.  And he went for it because he was so drugged out, 
[02:35:00]  but she meant five grand each.  Each.  Two credit cards.  What do you think's going to happen,  that no one's going to notice that?  Yeah.  I told you I got overcharged one time for ten grand.  Yeah, but I think...  Get out of here.  Yeah, but they stole it,  and I wound up getting my money back.  You did.  It took me a long time.  Credit card companies don't want to admit,  you know,  because then they have to do the work  and go get their money back.  So did you get it back through the credit card company?  Yeah, but I tried to prostitute on a credit card.  I'll never do that again.  Yeah, that's probably not a good thing. 
[02:35:30]  Amex probably frowns on that.  That was a bad move.  God, that looks good.  You want some?  You bet I do,  but I can't have any  because I've got to go get an endoscopy.  Yeah, you can't eat any.  We should all just sit around  and eat Jimmy's favorite foods  in front of him right now.  Great.  Bunch of asses up in the air.  Where's the story?  I want to know...  Go ahead, Ansel.  Go ahead, Big A.  Tap away, kid.  Go ahead, let her rip.  Just pick out the highlights. 
[02:36:00]  Uh-oh.  Yeah, there's sauce somewhere.  Go ahead.  The beginning or...?  Yeah, just pick out the highlights.  No, start at the end and read till the headline.  There you go.  That's the way everyone reads the news.  Attaboy, Ansel.  On Venus.  Go ahead. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, oh, oh.  What a night.  Beautiful for spacious.  Late December back in 63.  Yeah, it's fine.  Go ahead, let her rip.  Play along in your car.  Tap away with Andrew.  Go ahead, sweetie.  Come on, you're on. 
[02:37:00]  Go ahead.  Oh, oh, oh.  What a night.  Too bad.  Leonard.  Bonfaito.  Wait.  I can't remember it.  The Gramercy talk man who blackened out what appears on credit card bills to be a $40,000  evening of...  Right.  Of Hefnion. 
[02:37:30]  Hmm?  What?  Where are you, sweetie?  Who?  Hefnion.  Just jump ahead a little bit.  Jump ahead to the next time I go.  The poor guy is embarrassed to death to Kevin Clafferty, attorney for Manfredo.  What?  For Manfredo.  What?  The poor guy is embarrassed to death to Kevin Clafferty, attorney for Manfredo. 
[02:38:00]  33.  The problem is he doesn't remember a lot.  According to Manfredo's lawsuit, filed in Manhattan's free card, he called midnight club  escorts in Jamaica, Queens.  On March 19th, for the purpose of detaining the services of one of the dead squirts. 
[02:38:30]  Fifteen hours later, however, he awoke with only the fuzziness of memories of the night.  Right.  And three massive credit card bills.  One credit card company deemed $20,000 in charges unauthorized. 
[02:39:00]  But two other banks, MBNA and Advanta Bank Corp.  Did your parents have any children that live?  Sir, yes, sir.  How about they regret that?  Upheld a similar total according to the suit.  I have no idea what he's even saying.  Right.  No, no.  It makes sense.  The guy had a party.  Yeah.  And he went back from the strip club and it was like all these, this girl came with him 
[02:39:30]  but she called her friends after she slipped with Mickey and they charged a lot on the credit  card but they didn't get, one place didn't honor it but the other two places, which MBNA  of course did, because they're scum.  Oh, is that what happened?  One said it was on the list.  I wasn't listening.  Go ahead.  Just skip to that next to last paragraph.  Yeah, finish it up.  Yeah, next to last.  Not that one.  Yeah.  The other one.  Next to last.  No, right there.  Yep.  That one?  No, that, right there.  Good.  Your finger is almost, yeah, right there. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  Go ahead, Andrew.  If it can happen.  That was the one.  Oh, McClaffrey said his client filed a claim with the police.  No, no, no, no.  No, a little, that part doesn't matter, just the last, right there.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  The lawyer.  No, no, no, no.  Jimmy, help him out.  Right here.  There you go.  The suit. 
[02:40:30]  Well, starting there, but you don't need that line.  Just the next line.  See, yeah, right there.  Let me get it, sweetie.  There you go.  Uh-huh.  You got it now.  For the credit card charges that went through NB and a Advanter and Midnight Club escorts,  had no immediate comment.  Oh, that's it? 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  That's the end of it, yeah.  That's good.  Oh, really?  So, what was the story about?  Um, about a guy allegedly being tricked into paying $40,000.  Uh-huh.  And he claimed he was tricked into it.  Oh, there you go.  Uh-huh.  That's a good story.  All right.  Andrew, everyone.  Thank you, Andrew.  You want to take a break outside? 
[02:41:30]  You seem like you're sweating.  Yeah, Andrew's going to...  He's got enough.  He's going to regroup.  He's going to regroup.  He's...  Wow.  Wow.  Very good.  The big A, Andrew, everyone.  Holy crap.  Yeah.  Did a great job.  He certainly did.  All right, Ant.  Before we take another break, we're going to go right into Danny's news teases.  Love the news teases.  These are the ones that scare the crap out of you on a nightly basis on your local news. 
[02:42:00]  They love doing it.  We've all heard them, right?  We're still looking for the rest of the country to get involved.  We get a person here, a person there that records their local news and sends in some of the better, you know, fear news teases.  But we need more of you guys to step up to the plate and get active with this bid and send your audio in to steve at foundrymusic.com, okay?  Here's a perfect example of one of these news teases that is meant to just scare the crap out of you.  One city wants to pack all their sex offenders into a three-block area.  Problem is, it could be right next to your house. 
[02:42:30]  Now, who isn't scared of sex offenders?  Right.  Right in your neighborhood.  Could be.  And it turns out they're not next to your house.  Of course they're not.  Of course not.  So we're looking for you guys in the rest of the country to get involved and send in your news teases to steve at foundrymusic.com.  And then Danny throws it together nicely.  He collects them and gives us the better ones, all right?  You remind me that I have a very hot story when we come back from break.  Really?  Hot.  Sexy.  You're going to fart.  That's the beauty of him not eating in the last six hours. 
[02:43:00]  I know.  He hasn't farted yet.  Or has he?  I'm saving all my room for birthday cake.  It's not your birthday cake.  By the way, wait for this peanut butter to move down a little further.  I'll be gone.  Aunt and Eric can enjoy it.  Guaranteed by 11, this is going to be a nice one.  All right, here we go, Anthony.  Danny's news teases.  Because now we've got to name all the bits after everybody.  Yeah.  We made a mistake by naming that bit Travis TV, so now all the other guys are like, hey, what about me? 
[02:43:30]  Now they want their name in on it.  So this is Nat's bit or oversleeps TV?  It's Danny's...  Late for work TV.  It's Danny's when I'm not oversleeping.  I do work for the show a bit.  That's right.  Thank God for Tivo TV.  Right.  Here's Danny's news teases for this week.  A Fox 5 exclusive.  The George Washington Bridge.  Could it be terrorist's next target?  We've got the list that someone doesn't want you to see.  Who wouldn't want us to see that list, you ass? 
[02:44:00]  Who doesn't want us to see it?  What list is this?  What terrorist is going after the GWB?  It's...  So people go, wait, I drive on that bridge every day.  Who doesn't want me to see it?  Oh, I got to see that story now.  Whose list was it?  It's such an important list that we're not supposed to see it.  Does Danny know whose list it was?  Yeah, we'd like to know the ending of some of these news teases.  Because what happens when you watch the news, and then by the end of the newscast, you realize that tease was nothing.  It was absolutely nothing. 
[02:44:30]  We'll show you the list some people don't want you to see.  Terror targets.  If you live in a big city, okay, it's your transit system, it's your buses, it's your bridges, it's the nuclear power plant.  Yeah, the big targets.  We all know.  The big targets.  A list that some people don't want you to see.  They have a list, but they don't want us to see it.  But Fox got it.  But they got it.  They found it.  Because they're so much more important than us.  And they're going to tell you.  Liars.  You've heard all the warnings now. 
[02:45:00]  The tough question.  Just how prepared are you for an emergency?  How prepared are you?  A little test.  That's one of their test little subjects.  You're going to sit there and go, well, how prepared am I?  They'll have some expert on that's never been on camera before.  You've got to be careful near the stairs.  Yeah, well, how's that?  Well, that's the next thing we should do with the news is, you know, is to get all these experts.  Yeah, call out the experts.  Because, you know, terror experts. 
[02:45:30]  And they're going to be, you know, to prepare for another terror attack, you should have duct tape, you should have canned goods.  Go about your business.  Live your life.  And plenty of water.  And make sure you check on the elderly.  Thank you.  I'm an expert.  Go about your life, but be aware of your surroundings.  All right, great.  Thank you.  You told me nothing.  I do that every day.  Extra virgin olive oil.  Are you getting what you pay for?  Tomorrow at 6, I, with this news investigator, Sarah Wallace, exposes a company selling what may not be the real thing. 
[02:46:00]  It's not 100% extra virgin olive oil.  Plus, a simple way to test the purity of your olive oil.  That was a slow day for them, wasn't it?  Wow.  So when you go to the supermarket, it says 100% pure olive oil.  Extra virgin.  Extra virgin.  You're not getting a virgin.  You're not getting virgin juice.  Wow.  It's not.  Usually you test the purity of your olive oil.  Jesus, there we go.  You put a capful in somebody's hiney.  If you can get more than three palm sticks pure. 
[02:46:30]  If after the first one you're pulling out, it goes.  It's mixed with water.  Water.  Wow, well.  Yeah, it was in the olive oil business.  Well, all right, we're not safe from 100% virgin olive oil.  It might be, it might not be virgin.  All right, here we go.  The next news tease.  Coming up next tonight, a major recall on children's folding chairs. 
[02:47:00]  What parents need to know.  How about you at least give away the brand?  Yeah.  This is the classic one they always use, because everyone cares about their kids, obviously.  They're in the other room playing with a toy that might be dangerous, and they just tease it  to make you watch the entire newscast.  And then they'll tell you about one dumb toy that might be dangerous.  Well, maybe the little boy's in danger.  Or now it's a folding chair.  Folding chair.  We'll tell you, but not right now.  My God, my son right now is in the tub holding a plugged in iron on a folding chair. 
[02:47:30]  I hope that chair isn't a conductor of electricity.  Oh, it's dangerous, and we'll tell you, but we'll have to, we'll wait, though.  We have to fill with a bunch of other nonsense and a bunch of commercials, then we'll tell you.  Certain folding chairs have been found with pedophiles with erections sitting in them.  Beware that this isn't in your child's room.  All right.  The pedophile hides in the box, all folded in the chair with a heart on, until the kid 
[02:48:00]  unsuspectingly opens it and sits on it.  Hey, mister!  Who are you?  What are you poking me in the butt with a pen for?  He's got those little, those little short suspenders, suspender shorts, and the older gentleman  is slowly slipping them off his shoulders.  Say!  Hey!  I'm going to be chilly.  Shh!  All right, here we go.  I'm pushing my face in the pillow.  You're not supposed to touch me where my bathing suit covers? 
[02:48:30]  Why are you threatening my puppy?  I don't want you to wring a full neck.  Bathing suit covers.  All right, here we go with the next news tease, Anthony.  Yeah.  Coming up, the dog park illness that's spreading into the city.  What dog owners need to know.  Dog park illness?  Yes.  Well...  What is that?  Well, for the people, first of all, that live in the nice suburbs, you know, in New York 
[02:49:00]  here, they have these little parks that are just dedicated to dogs.  Dog shit runs.  People go there and let their dog shit all over the place, and then they bring the dog  back to their cramped apartment.  They run around and joke with the other owners how, oh, they're having a play date with their  stupid dogs.  It's a dog run, isn't it?  Like a fenced off area?  Yeah.  It's just for dogs?  It's just for dogs, so they can keep the poop all in one area.  Yeah.  And your dumb dog jumps up on your bed with shit kicked in his ass, shit all in his paws.  Stepping in at the dog park, and he nuzzles against your pillow and you kiss him. 
[02:49:30]  Dummies.  Let him lick your face?  Who's just licking another dog's asshole?  People are sick.  People are sick.  And now that's causing some illness that is now entering the streets.  Yeah.  It's not just contained in the dog park.  No, now it's out wild.  You'd never think that caked diarrhea in dog fur could cause an illness.  Plus, if you have a dog, better listen to this.  What you need to know about a contagious disease. 
[02:50:00]  Contagious disease.  Yee-ee-ee-ee-ee.  Sounds dangerous.  Of course it does.  Because we all have dogs that we love and that we pet.  Of course.  Yeah, we do this to their chin.  We crook our finger and go...  You give him a little scratch and his little chin pokes out a little bit.  That's right.  And you bury your fist in his jaw.  You kick him in the liver.  These dog owners in my neighborhood.  God.  But every once in a while...  We've all seen it because we talk about, you know, that they walk the dog and then the 
[02:50:30]  dog craps on the sidewalk and then they have a little sandwich bag that picks up the warm  goodness.  They use a little baggie and they put it on their hand and then they pick up the shit,  turn the baggie inside out, and now you've got a baggie full of shit.  But they were grabbing that warm, mushy, dog-shitty mess with nothing more than a thin sliver  of plastic wrap between their hand and the shit.  And you know you can smell it on your hands. 
[02:51:00]  Of course you can.  Stop.  What if there's a hole in the bag?  And then if you're Howard Stern, you wipe the dog's ass down to make sure there's nothing  left.  Because you use the little ass wipes like you use at home.  Little aloe ass wipes for his doggy.  But the point I'm going to make, every once in a while you get a dog that just has explosive  diarrhea and just lets loose all over the sidewalk.  And the area I live in, they're just a bunch of asses.  Just a bunch of just egomaniacs.  Yeah. 
[02:51:30]  And they won't let you leave until you pretty much scrub the sidewalk.  So everyone just kind of stands around with their Starbucks and just openly laughs at  the person.  Laughs at the person?  Oh yeah.  Because usually it's a nice quick clean up.  But every once in a while I get that dog with the explosive diarrhea.  That's wonderful.  That makes the dog owner live the life of hell for a little while.  It's great.  Little tail looks like a mounds bar.  And encased.  Let's go to Joe in Iowa.  Joe, what's going on, buddy? 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, I was watching a news broadcast in Pennsylvania yesterday and they showed a school bus that got  ran into by a pickup and there was body bags on the road and the news piece said, were any  of the children on this bus injured, we'll let you know at five.  Really?  What were the body bags for?  The driver in the pickup was the one that actually got killed and they covered his body  up so that the kids couldn't see it.  But it's a much more scary story if you think the kids might have been killed. 
[02:52:30]  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, they know what they're doing.  That's why we love the assaults on the media.  Also, I wanted to know if Andrew would be the illegitimate love child of the Iron Sheik.  Who's the Iron Sheik?  Iron.  The Iron Sheik.  Punching out.  All right, Joe.  Thank you.  On with the news teaser.  Any time a joke has illegitimate child of in it, it's going to stink.  We're from hell or on crack.  On hell.  On crack, right.  That looks like a such and such on crack. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, she was like bottling but not from hell.  Really?  You're the bag full of shit.  That's who you are.  The hack.  More news teases.  Fluck.  Changes at the drugstore while your over-the-counter cold remedy could be harder to get.  Maybe you can go to, speaking of drug steers, you want your stuff, go to Duane Reade.  That's a fine place to fill a prescription if you want to see Jen, Jane, my fucking...  Oh, wow. 
[02:53:30]  Jimmy, have a cup of coffee and just spare us.  I was going to say Jane Goodall in action.  It would have been a gem, but I said Jen, good gentlemen.  Jen Goodall.  You know, her sister.  She's nothing.  Georgia!  What's Georgia?  Oh, I'm just...  You know what it is?  On this day last year, I'm just...  I'm nervous because sometimes, like, when I go to blow the candles out, the wind blows  the fire back on me and I get afraid.  Stop it.  It's not your birthday. 
[02:54:00]  It is.  It is.  On with the next news tease.  Coming up on Fox 5 News, Security Shake-Up.  Plans to take screeners away from local airports.  How will it affect your safety?  Oh, how is it going to affect my safety?  Motherfuckers.  They'll just be letting people through with AK-47s now, right?  How about this for a news tease?  Muslims being removed from your town.  How will this increase your safety?  Please.  Listen to this one again.  Coming up on Fox 5 News, Security Shake-Up. 
[02:54:30]  Plans to take screeners away from local airports.  How will it affect your safety?  Your safety.  It's not going to affect it at all.  We're here to tell you.  They just want to personalize every horrible story.  It's going to affect you.  You.  Yeah.  We'll tell you.  We're your friends.  We're going to help you out with this one.  All right.  Let's say hi to Chuck.  What's up, Chuck?  Get it.  How you guys doing?  I get it.  Thank you.  Hey, you guys remember five or six years ago when you guys talked about a site called 
[02:55:00]  dogdude.com and you brought up dog shit before and I remember this.  You were able to actually mail dog shit to anybody you wanted to anonymously through  a website.  I think we got caught up in that and we did that a few times.  Send it to your boss and it's all anonymous but you could send him a package and he'd open  it up and it's just dog shit in the box.  Yeah, I remember that.  I think we talked to a creator of that website a long time ago.  Well, you could actually get different sized dog shit.  You could get like the Pitbull or the Chihuahua. 
[02:55:30]  Who wouldn't just want the big Mastiff?  Yeah.  Just a huge log.  What was the name of the site?  I really can't even remember.  I just remember driving around five years ago doing the same thing I'm doing now, listening  to you and remembering that site you guys mentioned.  All right.  Thank you, Chuck.  Thank you, guys.  I like to get like the two minutes.  This is liquidyhorsediarrheashit.com.  That'd be nice.  Nice five-pound bag.  You know what you're getting?  Hey, Mike.  What's going on?  Hey, I always give you a happy birthday. 
[02:56:00]  It sounded fun.  Thanks, man.  No problem.  Punch it out.  Birthday.  Jennifer in Montana.  What's up, Jennifer?  Hey.  Hey.  How are you guys?  Good.  What's up, Jennifer?  Hey.  I just wanted to give you guys some props.  I'm in Montana.  Very isolated area of Montana.  We've probably got like a thousand people in our town.  Wow.  And there's a bunch of us that have just gotten XM Radio, and it's only for your guys' show.  Nice.  Montana.  It's freaking awesome. 
[02:56:30]  It's hilarious.  In fact, I stay at home with my kids, and I have a two- and a three-year-old, and there  are times when I have to turn it off.  Yeah.  Jennifer?  But not for long.  Jennifer?  Yeah.  No one gives a shit.  Oh, no.  Opie, don't turn off Montana.  Oh, you hung up.  Do you know how important every listener is?  No one gives a shit if she's listening to this show.  Yes, we do.  You know how hard this is for me to say, but I'm going to say it.  Yeah. 
[02:57:00]  Jennifer, we do care.  Oh.  I know Anthony doesn't give a crap.  He's been watching the clock all morning because he's going to Atlantic City right at  11 o'clock.  Playing with these chips now, and I'm so psyched to get in the fray.  Borgata?  Yes.  Nice.  And I'm seeing Tom Jones tonight.  Very cool.  I'm seeing Tom Jones.  How about that?  How much for tickets?  Let me see.  I got them in my wallet.  Search bomb.  I like Tom Jones.  He's just a cool... 
[02:57:30]  He doesn't know he's old.  I think he's funny to watch.  He's great.  You watch his little thing.  They were $75 a piece.  Nice.  Good seats?  Yeah, they're all right.  You know.  I'm not right up front.  I'm not going to get to see the old bags throw their panties at him.  But it'll be fun.  And then it's three-card poker.  Is he playing at the Borgata?  No.  He's over there at resorts.  He can be over at resorts.  So I've got to zip over to resorts.  And then it's just poker all night. 
[02:58:00]  Three-card poker.  Try, try, try vagina  Try, try, try vagina  So before my penis starts to get sore  Go pick up some bags 
[02:58:30]  You knew that  You're a local drug store  Said go get some bags  You knew that  You're a local drug store  Oh, you stink, baby  I wonder if he'll do that one tonight.  I wonder too, Anthony.  Brother Joe, of course.  Who's doing the U2 thing down in Atlantic City this weekend, right?  Yes!  Jesus, he's all over the place now.  Goddamn, I can't...  What a great plug. 
[02:59:00]  I have no idea where he's going to be down there.  It's probably on his website.  I'll blurt it out before the end of the show  because we're going to go down there.  My mom, Sal, I think my sister's showing up, Patrick.  Tonight for the show?  Yeah, we're all going to be down there.  We're all going to Tom Jones?  Hanging out.  I think Tom Jones and then tomorrow I'm going to go see Joe.  But Joe's playing tonight also.  All right.  It's going to be a whole big weekend with me and my family.  Back to the news teases, Anthony.  Courtesy of Danny.  Here's the next one.  And the spectacular show when a mountain blows its top. 
[02:59:30]  But is this anything to worry about?  What?  I guess so.  What the...  It's a story about Big Kev getting angry.  He blew its top.  Well, the mountain somewhere blew its top and now you're wondering if that was in your...  Are they teasing a volcano?  And how it may affect you?  I would say a volcano is not affecting us here in New York.  Well, yeah.  I guess we got to let everyone in on that one.  That was a New York tease.  That's a New York tease. 
[03:00:00]  Last I looked, there wasn't a mountain nearby.  They're trying to scare us with volcano?  Had the spectacular show when a mountain blows its top.  But is this anything to worry about?  No.  I hate the question.  And then at 10.58 they'll say, uh, no.  No.  Everything will be just fine.  It's not.  All right.  Let's move on here to the next one.  A backyard accident nearly killed this local girl.  A hidden danger exposed at 11.  Ooh.  Hidden danger now. 
[03:00:30]  That sounds very dangerous.  A little girl almost killed something in the backyard.  They'll tell you what it was about.  Not only was she in danger, but now you might be because it's a hidden danger.  They couldn't expose it real quick before they went to...  No.  Before they went to sports.  Don't expose it.  I'd love to know, I wish we could find stats on how many more people are killed a year  by things that they could have told you about and didn't.  There's no way to get that statistic, but that would be an interesting one.  These scumbags.  Safety concerns over three popular asthma medications.  Find out what the fuss is about in The Health Watch. 
[03:01:00]  Tonight at 11.  Maybe it's more than a fuss.  Yeah.  You know.  Find out what the scuttlebutt is.  Find out what the hullabaloo is.  Oh, the hullabaloo.  By the way, how long has Steve Seab been doing news?  Didn't that sound like him?  Asthma medications.  Didn't sound like Steve.  You need your coffee.  Safety concerns over three popular asthma medications.  Find out what the fuss is about in The Health Watch.  Tonight at 11.  Find out what the fuss is about in The Health Watch. 
[03:01:30]  In The Health Watch.  Ramone, bring me my asthma meds.  You're right.  Ramone, give me some air.  Joe is at Harrah's Eden Lounge.  Friday and Saturday night at 8 p.m.  Go check that out.  Let's say hi to Charlie the Trucker.  Charlie.  Charlie.  Yes, sir.  How we doing?  Hi.  Hey.  I was wondering if I could get a turd update there in the park garage.  I just took a look.  It has completely gone away. 
[03:02:00]  It is now just a slight brown, dark, like almost tobacco colored stain on the curb.  This is something I was wishing I had taken a still picture of every day or videotaped every day.  Some homeless guy had used the garage door to my parking garage as a backrest when he took a dump.  So he just took a dump on the curb that goes into my parking garage.  So every day I had to walk past this human shit that is sitting on there. 
[03:02:30]  And I noticed after about a week it had started decomposing and drying out.  And then it got this flaky onion skin texture to it.  And then it turned into what looked like big tobacco leaves stacked up on top of each other.  And that slowly blew away, I guess.  And I would have loved to have documented on a daily basis how they had just, how it had decomposed.  But now it is just a, uh, a little brown stain on the curb. 
[03:03:00]  Huh?  I got a Ben Thong joke.  All right, go ahead.  That Ben Thong's so big it has to have to go to the tires.  Ah, fuck it, punch it out.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Another disaster.  So that'll end the, uh, the turd bit.  Yeah, that's, it's over.  It's over.  I need another homeless guy turd to look after.  I hate bits that end.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Pat Battle bit has officially ended.  Although, Jim's birthday bit. 
[03:03:30]  Hopefully that'll end by, uh, Monday.  Whenever my birthday ends, I'm happy.  It's over today.  My birthday today.  Oh, my gosh.  I see the Jim birthday bit going on for a while.  Oh, God.  Stop it.  All right, here we go.  Another news tease.  This one is my favorite of the week.  This mom was perfectly healthy.  Suddenly she was in a coma.  Are tampons really to blame?  Whoa.  Whoa.  Oh, tampons.  I believe that affects a lot of ladies out there. 
[03:04:00]  Well, if you insert them with a rifle, it may be a problem.  That sounds dangerous.  What is that?  That toxic shock syndrome that comes up in the news every so often?  What is that?  For the husband, what a blessing, though.  One minute she's kvetching and being a real twat, and the next minute laying on the bed with her mouth half open.  Thank you, guys.  What a lot.  Your chick's going to go into a coma, let's be honest.  Period. 
[03:04:30]  It's the finest time to do it.  It's so true.  Wow, that sounded dangerous, though.  All these women sitting around watching the news with strings hanging out.  Yeah.  They might be in danger.  Oh.  But they'll tell you after the weather.  This mom was perfectly healthy.  Suddenly she was in a coma.  Are tampons really to blame?  You thought that was good?  Yeah.  What do you got?  We have one that finishes this bit up for the week.  All right.  And it's better than the one you just heard.  Give us a listen. 
[03:05:00]  The tampons caused this woman to lose her hands and legs.  People are dying, and others are getting maimed.  Coming up in just a few minutes.  Holy shit.  Wow.  It's just a tampon.  Stop it.  Holy shit.  What happens when you drop your tampon under the lawnmower?  Try to fish it out in a panic.  With your feet.  And hands.  I got a critique of this particular news program. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  That story was intense on its own.  They didn't need the dramatic music.  No, the music.  Definitely not necessary.  Did tampons cause this woman to lose her hands and legs?  People are dying, and others are getting maimed.  Coming up in just a few minutes.  Damn.  It's like the music from The Omen or The Exorcist.  Very scary.  Very scary.  Making you lose your onto the legs.  Does anyone know the end of that story?  Because now I need to know.  Yeah, she died, and then Raj and Dee and Dwayne and Reron had nothing to do. 
[03:06:00]  So, that's a very good joke.  Yeah.  Wow.  Well, this is the part of the bit where we find out the answers to some of these things.  Go ahead, James.  Yeah, this volcano you guys were talking about is Mount St. Helens.  It was almost about ready to erupt a little while back.  Yeah.  Over here in Washington.  3,000 miles away.  Yeah.  I also had a question.  Whatever happened to the assignment in America you guys were doing about the parents and the kids cursing? 
[03:06:30]  I don't know what the hell's going on with that.  I was looking forward to that after that lady put her daughter on.  I don't get it because, unfortunately, I think the lawyers may have gotten a hold of that bit, and they're not letting go yet.  Oh, okay.  So, maybe we just have the parents call with their kids in the car and do it.  Yeah.  I don't see the problem with kids cursing on the radio.  Especially if the parents say it's okay.  Yeah.  Well, it's the same thing about that, like, the video game thing you guys were talking about with, you know, Grand Theft Auto. 
[03:07:00]  You know, that the parents are responsible for their kids' intake of the media thing.  And if they're not monitoring what their kids are playing, then it's not, you know, the game player's fault.  It's not the game manufacturer's fault.  What happened to this call?  I looked away for a second.  Hey, bro, you're losing your limbs as you talk here.  Do you have a tampon in?  Hey, Charlie, let me ask you. 
[03:07:30]  Do you really think the media is responsible, though, if technically bad parenting is not what's going to be happening?  Shut up, Jimmy!  Shut up, sir.  Yeah.  No, what I'm saying is...  No, no, but you're talking about the media.  No!  All right, I admit it, it's your fucking birthday.  Shut up.  Thank you, James.  Speaking of Grand Theft Auto really fast, a story we didn't get to.  A city granny who bought her grandson a video game that promises murder and mayhem in a city of gang trouble, drugs, and corruption says she was shocked to hear it contained sex, too. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah.  Florence Cohen, 85 years young.  85 years young.  Says in papers filed in Manhattan Federal Court that the maker of Grand Theft Auto engaged in false, deceptive, and misleading practices.  So she's suing.  She bought the game for her 14-year-old grandson.  It was rated M. It was rated M for mature, which means you had to be 17 years or older to buy the game. 
[03:08:30]  She pretty much bought an R-rated movie for her 14-year-old, is what she did.  But there is sex, there is nudity in R-rated movies, more than you're going to get in a Grand Theft Auto game.  It's her fault, not the game's fault.  Now the game has what is, in essence, an X rating, and it's not going to be sold.  Thank you.  I could be screwing everything up.  This version's not going to be sold, and then the later versions of this game are going to be so much tamer. 
[03:09:00]  And everybody that puts out a game now is going to make it tame because they're going to be afraid, and they pretty much successfully censored video games right now.  That's right.  And people are still confused.  They think the sex scenes were in the actual game itself.  Yeah, the code was in there, but in order to access it, you had to download something on the web.  Right.  It wasn't just off the shelf.  You had to access something off the web. 
[03:09:30]  You had to go through a lot of trouble.  I want to put out a request, too.  If anyone's listening in Houston, there was a morning radio show I did.  I was just thinking of it as you guys were talking.  And there's two guys in the studio, but one guy does three voices.  He does a gay character, a black character, and a hillbilly character.  Stop.  But you're not supposed to acknowledge that it's one guy doing all the voices.  Really?  Sounds riveting.  Revolting.  So if anybody down there, I forget the name of the show in Houston.  It's the old Jimmy Fallon bit from SNL.  And we're black!  And he used to do all the different voices. 
[03:10:00]  If anyone's listening to that radio program or knows what it is, could you please call in with that?  There's two guys.  They were thrown off the air on one station, and they came back recently on another station.  You want to give them praise is what it is?  Yeah.  Yeah, because I just didn't.  I just couldn't.  It was a laugh.  Well, here's the deal.  I'm scared.  A couple things.  We love the wacky radio bit.  It's not working like we want it to work yet.  So maybe some of you young go-getters out there that want a little attention, maybe you could tape some of this wacky radio and send it in, where we're guaranteed to get a really wacky radio segment. 
[03:10:30]  Then we can go through it, because we know better, really.  Don't tape their whole show.  Just a nice segment that you know would make for some good radio, because it's so over-the-top wacky.  Send it in.  We'll give you credit, of course.  Because that's a bit that has so much potential, and we're not there yet.  But I do want to hear if someone has the mind, just to hear how awful these three voices are.  Well, you reminded me, yes.  Definitely want that, and other guys around the country doing the wacky stuff.  And then, of course, news teases.  We love this bit.  It's a great bit, but we need other people from around America to help us out with this. 
[03:11:00]  So your local news, when you get these silly news teases, please tape it and send it in to Steve.  Steve gets all audio for this program.  Not me, not Anthony, not Jimmy.  Steve, Steve, Steve.  Send it to Steve.  Email steve at foundrymusic.com with all your audio.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music dot com.  All right, we're going to take a quick break, and we'll continue.  I see my hero is here today.  Ooh, who's that, Big A?  Brother Wheeze. 
[03:11:30]  That is Wheeze.  I thought that was Wheeze.  Yeah, he's in town to get a checkup on his cancer thing.  We've got to get him on the air.  I thought that was Wheeze, but you didn't say anything.  I'm like, that guy looks like Wheeze.  Who is it?  He's literally my hero.  And there he is on his cell phone right there.  Do you know it's my birthday?  That's why he's here.  You guys are having a party for me.  There's no party for you.  It's not your birthday.  Andrew dug out Doug Wheeze.  He's my mentor.  He has helped so many people on radio and doesn't really get the credit for it.  And he's just an amazing guy. 
[03:12:00]  We'll talk to him next, all right?  Right.  Get some!  Hear, hear, hear, hear, hear.  The wind is making it, make it roll.  Le'ry, le'ry, re.  Needed a head, needed a drawing.  Himming her, himming her, himming her, himming her.  Well, then what's that?  Yeah.  Which?  What?  Why?  Where?  Shark.  What?  What?  Who?  What?  Why?  We have problems.  We have problems.  Shake it up.  Shake it up.  Shake it up.  Shake it up.  Shake it up.  Shake it up.  Shake it up.  Shake it up. 
[03:12:30]  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program,  the one-a-virus spreading across America,  thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  Jim Norton's going to leave in a few minutes here.  Oh, Jimmy.  Got to get a procedure done.  He's all scared, and I'm laughing at you now  because Brother Weez is in the studio.  He can tell you all about procedures.  Endoscopy.  I had him.  Piece of cake.  Don't be scared at all.  People shouldn't be scared.  My wife would...  Oh, and that.  Is that the tushy?  No.  Throat.  I had both of them. 
[03:13:00]  My wife...  Check this out.  My wife was sitting with me when I had the endoscopy  because I'm...  Wait, which one is that?  That's down the throat all the way down, right?  Yeah.  But they give you the Versed.  Anthony knows about Versed.  Come on, Ant.  Oh, good drugs?  It's a drug.  Supposedly it just makes you forget,  but actually you're sleeping.  But they let my wife come in the room while they were doing it,  and I woke up in the middle of it  with the thing all the way down my throat,  but don't even be worried.  She was right in my face.  I woke up, she says,  Honey, it's almost done, 
[03:13:30]  which it wasn't,  and the guy hit me with another piece of drip.  Back to sleep.  It's nothing, bro.  Don't worry about it.  How long does it take?  What's the difference?  You're seeing it.  Good point.  How long did it take?  About 40 minutes.  40 minutes.  Yeah, but to you,  you just shut your eyes,  and then you open them up,  and you're done.  You're done.  You don't even know what happened.  It's like time travel.  You're really going?  Well, you got stomach problems, bro?  I've had bad air hunger,  which I think is anxiety,  but I'm getting every possibility checked.  Wait, what's air hunger?  I've never heard it in my life.  I was running out of air on stage.  What? 
[03:14:00]  I told you I was running out of air on stage.  But it's called air hunger?  When you feel like you can take a breath,  but there's something restricting your lungs.  You're having anxiety.  That's anxiety.  I think you're right,  but I'm checking everything out.  I'm checking esophagus.  I want everything checked,  so I know it's not bad.  It's a shame you're an addict.  Drugs would do you so well.  I was just going to tell the brother  that the one thing,  I have a lot of anxiety also,  and I have a lot of the same symptoms you get,  but what I do is,  like when I'm getting my fake heart attack  or if I've got air hunger,  I pop me a couple of magic vitamin X,  Xanax,  and if the symptom is gone, 
[03:14:30]  then I know it's a bunch of crap.  I'm not really sick to this.  Right.  And if you do that,  then you'll know,  and then the next time I get my fake heart attack,  I know it's fake,  and I plow through it.  I can't take any drugs.  I'm an addict.  I can't do it.  If I take drugs,  I'll want to...  So now you're getting stuff  stuck down your throat and everything.  If I go back to drugs,  I'll have stuff stuck down my throat too in jail.  You can use without going to jail.  Please.  He's the real deal.  He stopped drinking at what, 17?  18.  He blew his load at 18 years old. 
[03:15:00]  Can you imagine?  Who reaches bottom at that age?  Bro, you haven't had nothing since you were 18?  February 1st of 87.  Can you imagine that?  How do you know you can't have a nice Xanax?  How are you going to go through life with anxiety  and you can't eat a Xanax?  Just because it comes out like the personality is the same  and the fact that if I start masturbating at the computer,  six hours later,  sometimes I'm still there with a backache  and I haven't come.  I'm like,  you really want to get away from yourself?  Listen,  you know,  we talk about this where I'm from  and I don't want to hurt a guy that's an addict, 
[03:15:30]  but I don't believe a lot of this crap,  especially when you were,  you know,  at 18 years old,  you had the alcohol and drug problem.  I mean,  you know,  you're going to miss a lot of painkillers  that your body needs.  Well,  is it a painkillers like Xanax?  I can't,  if it's,  I'm on a marker,  like if I get surgery  and I have to have something,  that's different.  It's all motives.  If my motive is to get high,  it's wrong.  What about Vicodin?  I would only take that after.  I love Vicodin.  Real pain.  I had Vicodin for my tooth  and I was,  I started getting to the point where  the first day I'm counting,  I'm going,  I only have 18 left. 
[03:16:00]  You're like,  you take one.  After the first one,  I'm counting on,  shit,  I'm going to be out of these soon.  And it feels legit  because you were,  you know,  prescribed.  Right.  So you're like,  hey,  I'm supposed to do all 18.  Anthony's shuffling chips on here.  I know.  I got busted for that in my joint.  They make me take them.  I started the shuffling thing.  You're not getting complaints.  Dude,  stop with the fucking chips.  He's going to Atlantic City  right after the show.  Borgata,  I was just talking,  I was just watching your old lady.  She's doing fine.  I got,  I got the bankroll.  How much are you bringing?  This, 
[03:16:30]  uh,  nine large.  Jesus.  What are you going to play?  Huh?  What are you going to play?  Um,  I usually play three card poker.  Are you kidding me?  No,  you know something?  I do very well on that stupid game.  Bro,  it's a sucker game.  Do not do it.  No,  I,  you know something?  I got a system.  I think he made that nine G.  I went three card poker.  That's what I made last time.  Yes.  That's all the money I made last time I went.  I'm going back with what I want.  I never put it in the bank.  I kept it out.  And now I'm going back to give it back to them.  Now,  do you play hold them like you're all 80 or not?  Yeah.  Then play hold them. 
[03:17:00]  And then you're playing other people instead of the house.  I understand.  When you play three card hold them,  you're ripping your ass off.  And you got lucky.  No,  I know.  I know I got lucky.  All right.  I understand that.  I love holding.  I love holding.  With that nine grand,  that's a huge bank.  But it certainly is.  You can have,  you can play,  you can go down there and play 8160.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  What's 8160?  Huge game.  But he could play 2040 hold them,  which is a nice level hold them.  Yeah.  And sit there all day and if he's good,  probably win some money.  I don't,  you know what it is though?  I don't like to commit to that much time sometimes.  A lot of time.  You know, 
[03:17:30]  so,  because we like hanging out and,  and my chick does very good at the three card poker too.  Oh,  she's going to play that.  Now she's online on party poker.  And you know,  she,  for a while she was giving me a little bit of shit at home because I,  I wasn't listening to anything.  I'm just playing,  playing,  playing.  And now I get home and I hear it going,  son of a bitch,  a straight.  Oh yeah.  I was like,  oh,  okay.  It's over Johnny.  Oh yeah.  She's a good player.  I was watching.  She's really good.  Very good player.  Is she up?  Yeah.  No,  well she was in a little tournament and she was down to about four people and she was playing good poker. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah.  I was watching.  And then she said she was going to the Borgata.  Yeah.  Man,  am I jealous?  It's a,  I love going down there.  Going to see my brother.  He's playing down there this weekend.  And then we're seeing Tom Jones tonight.  What's his band now?  He's got a U2 band.  He's a dude I met with,  with the Good Rats.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  He was playing with,  that's right.  He was with the Good Rats for a while.  For a while.  Yeah.  And Rochester,  the Good Rats are huge in Rochester.  And now he's playing in a goddamn,  doing better than he ever has in a U2 tribute band.  And the guy plays U2 tribute. 
[03:18:30]  That's all they play is U2.  The guy looks,  the singer looks like Bono.  And they're booked all over the country.  They're playing in,  yeah,  they're playing in Ireland.  Mexico City.  Mexico City.  They're going all over the place.  He's making more money than he ever has  playing his own music.  Anyone else's music,  doing a fucking tribute band.  It'd be amazing.  This fucking thing's freaking me out.  Oh,  right.  You keep thinking,  you should lunge for a dump.  I know.  Man.  Yeah.  You know what?  I like when people on regular radio come here  because they probably go back and get in trouble.  Are you kidding?  It's like,  wait a minute.  Oh,  shit.  Bro,  no,  I,  you know, 
[03:19:00]  I got Shazit.  I say Shazit and Fuzuk.  Those are my two big ones.  And they probably give you a little bit of crap about that.  Give me some Trezap.  But,  I mean,  we can't even say,  you know,  I work for the company you guys work for  and they have their own dictates.  Not even the FCC.  They got,  they're worse.  You can't even say dictate,  can you?  Bro,  we can't say masturbate.  Yeah.  I had a fight because it was a news story.  We're reading the news out of the newspaper.  Dude got caught with the masturbate.  We can't say it.  This is ridiculous.  Isn't that amazing?  And you're fucking in here.  It's not.  Oh,  yeah,  we're fucking in here. 
[03:19:30]  It's not one of the seven words.  It's not,  why the hell can't you use it?  Especially in a context that has nothing to do with sex.  You're reporting a story.  Ridiculous.  Well,  because,  you know,  because they're overreacting.  They're scared to death.  Yep.  They're scared of getting fired.  But the greatest thing about Opie and Anthony is,  no matter whatever happens to you cats,  are you not the first fucks?  We're the first fucks.  No,  seriously,  right?  We're the pioneers of satellite radio.  This is forever.  I mean,  this is going to be forever.  And you are the,  you're going to be in some history.  You know how pissed Howard Stern is? 
[03:20:00]  He is so pissed.  Then he makes his announcement,  and then he's going on the air going,  I'm going to be the pioneer of satellite radio.  And people called him out.  I'm like,  dude,  our wagon is on the West Coast.  We've been panning for gold for months now.  That's right.  That's it.  He's the pioneer.  Shut up.  What a dick.  I invented everything.  Dig this.  I know you know about this,  but I'm driving to work one day last week,  and I swear to God,  I never listened to the cat,  but I pushed the button.  My station went on commercials.  I pushed the button,  and I heard that bit where he called in, 
[03:20:30]  and they had David Lee Roth.  You saw it in the paper?  Uh-huh.  And I'm listening to it.  The hackiest thing ever.  And I'm going,  so I came into the station,  and I told my friends,  I go,  either that was the worst bit I ever heard,  and it was the worst.  The David Lee Roth guy was terrible.  The woman,  I mean,  he sounded like David Lee Roth,  but no way he could be that big of an asshole,  because this guy was being,  and Stern was being all serious about,  can I say goodbye to my audience?  I'm going,  can't the fuck,  this is,  who's buying it?  Now how do you do that to your own audience,  and they're still going to dig it?  Right, I know. 
[03:21:00]  That's the part I don't get.  Who's buying it?  Very lazy, too.  It's the hardcore fans that think it's 1988 still,  and you know.  But what's that bit?  What was that bit,  they kicked me off the radio,  and will you let me say goodbye?  If you figure it out,  let me know.  And if you're going to do that bit,  you've got to commit.  He was on by,  what?  Not even an hour later.  If you're going to do that bit,  you do it all morning,  let the press run with it,  but his ego's so big,  he can't commit to the bit.  Or maybe the David Lee Roth guy  couldn't carry the show,  well, you know,  fake David Lee Roth.  Right.  By the way,  I brought the big dog in today. 
[03:21:30]  These guys hate the left.  I'm here.  Whatever they want to do.  By the way,  I will tell you this.  You know,  I just found out,  for instance,  I heard Penn Jillette  took a shot at Michael Moore  on some TV show,  and it freaks me out,  because they've got a great show  on Showtime  that beats up the right  all the time.  I don't understand it.  But how can you guys possibly,  I just heard Janine Garofalo  do the most genius rant.  Oh, boy.  I'm telling you,  the broad is extremely bright,  bro.  I mean, 
[03:22:00]  she is over most people's heads,  and that's why she probably  doesn't have an audience.  But she can think deeply,  and she has a lot of stuff to say.  But I mean,  how can you,  you guys are telling me  that this George Bush cat  is not the fake,  he's going to go down  as the worst president ever,  I promise you.  I can't stand him.  Well,  then you're,  I can't stand him.  Then you're not a righty.  No,  but I am far from the left.  I,  I,  well,  it was like you were saying  about Janine,  see,  I got to go.  No,  no,  no,  no,  Jimmy.  Look at Jim leaving.  Jimmy is the king of screaming  on the show.  That's why I hate the left.  Well,  let me hear.  Give me a minute. 
[03:22:30]  I hate Garofalo.  I hate her.  Why?  Because she's a fraud.  Oh,  I don't know this.  Why?  She's not funny.  Funny's got nothing to do  with what she's doing  and what I listen to.  See,  she's a comedian though.  To me as a comedian,  if you,  if you can't speak through  your work comedically,  I'm,  that's what I'm joking about.  You're probably right about that.  It's very hard to point out  where she goes awry  to somebody else  who is very far left.  You just,  it's the same thing  as the right.  It's the same exact thing  as you trying to point out  something wrong  Bush to somebody  that is so far right 
[03:23:00]  they don't want to hear it.  Okay,  here's where I disagree.  Let's say we're talking  about O'Reilly.  Okay?  I can point out  monster lies  and proof of the lies  that the guy  puts on his audience  He's a hypocrite.  He's bullshit.  Say what,  you know,  Rush Limbaugh says  on his radio show  that if you get caught  with drugs  that aren't prescribed  for you,  you should go right to jail,  directly to jail,  do not pass no.  Another hypocrite.  Until his ass gets caught.  You know,  O'Reilly's doing phone sex  for a lot.  It's the right  that talks about  carrying the family values flag. 
[03:23:30]  That's why we hate it.  Because Bill Clinton  got busted for a knob job  which every other president  or maybe every other president  was getting.  But no,  see now you guys  write that blowjob thing off  like it was nothing.  It was nothing.  Technically,  it was nothing.  It was the trust of the office.  Oh,  that's crap.  But it isn't.  But it isn't.  The trust of that office  was stepped on.  Wait,  you tell me  I'm worried  if a guy's getting a knob.  By Bill Clinton.  Bruh.  It could have been  anything that he did  in there.  What it was was 
[03:24:00]  That's how bad  they were trying to bust him.  The guy was bullshitting  to the American people.  You mean about the blowjob?  Yeah.  Come on, bruh.  It's nobody's business.  You're allowed to get blowjob.  You dig this.  When men go for power  in the world,  any powerful cat,  why does he want power?  To get pussy.  This is the truth.  That I agree with.  The only reason men,  why do men buy Lamborghinis?  You know.  When you become  the most powerful cat  in the world,  if you ain't getting  blowjobs in your office,  then turn in the crown.  And you know,  in France,  I know y'all hate France,  and it's a funny thing  to bring up, 
[03:24:30]  but in France,  I remember they were  burying the prime minister  about seven,  eight years ago,  and his mistress  was at the friggin' funeral,  and the people  in that country,  which are,  you know,  they've been around  a lot longer than us,  they don't think  a damn thing of it.  That's right.  Because men want pussy.  There's a certain dignity  that the office  needs to uphold.  I don't care  that he got pussy,  and did Kennedy do it?  No, I never cared  that he got pussy.  It was never the blowjob  was the issue for me.  I never cared about that.  You're right.  Let him.  Nixon had a mistress.  They all do.  There you go.  My problem was  that when you're called,  when you're under oath,  you know what?  You gotta give it up.  Tough shit.  You gotta give it up. 
[03:25:00]  Why won't you guys  just say he fucked up  and not just...  This is what I'm telling you,  because I got the man's handbook.  When I got born  and my little penis popped up,  they handed me this book  that says the only time  you can lie  is when you're getting a blowjob.  That's it.  At one time...  But you know,  this is the rule.  I'm fucked.  But anyway,  I told you not  to bring her up here,  Hope.  But you know,  come on, bro.  You get caught.  I don't know what she gave you.  I mean,  you're a good man, right? 
[03:25:30]  Let's just say  you fall off the wagon  and you're getting a knobber  and your old lady hears about it.  Right.  I know guys  that got caught  in the bed.  The wife saw the dude  in the bed.  Six months later,  he got her believing  it didn't happen.  It's the man's handbook.  You can't...  You know,  in all of history,  let me just finish.  In all of history,  nobody bothered the presidents  for getting pussy  until this frigging  right-wing conspiracy,  which everyone laughs at,  except for the people  that believe it,  which is half the country,  finally busted this guy  for a blowjob. 
[03:26:00]  That was heinous  for them to do that.  Well,  how about the left  sinking everybody  who's made a politically  incorrect statement  and then Jerry Brown,  I think it was Jerry Brown,  says nigger  and nobody says anything.  I don't know about this.  Of course,  we have a story here  we were going to talk about  one day.  And Sharpton's like,  well...  What's his name?  They ran for the Green Party.  Oh,  was it Ralph Nader?  Ralph Nader.  Okay,  I apologize.  It was Nader.  He said nigger  and sometimes they treated me  like a nigger.  He was trying to be  like the hip white guy  that can get away with it.  But the double standard  on the left  is just as repulsive.  No one called him to task. 
[03:26:30]  Even Sharpton came out  and goes,  well,  he's got a good history  with black people.  He's not a racist.  Meanwhile,  the conservatives  said that  they'd be standing  in front of  Because we believe  conservatives are racist.  That's what they are  in history.  Put it this way.  You see a guy  carrying a confederate flag  that wants to put  black people somewhere.  That's a righty,  bro.  It ain't a lefty.  But then we argue  all the time  that the left  is more racist  because they're the ones  with the programs  that are trying  to coddle people  that in their opinion  aren't as good  as capable  as the people 
[03:27:00]  that need  to care for them.  You see,  that's the whole thing.  The righties always say  everybody can grow up  to be president.  You've got to work.  Sure you've got to work,  but go out in the street.  There's crack addicts  all over the joint.  The realism in life  is tough  and you're going to  have to have programs.  If they ever stop  these programs  that the left  put together,  there's going to be  riots in the streets.  And the left  would start losing elections  because the people  that they're giving  these programs to  would stop voting for them.  The left does have  a certain interest.  Just like the right  has a certain interest  in keeping big business happy, 
[03:27:30]  the left has a certain interest  in keeping certain people  in a certain position  because that is  their voting base.  You see,  that's a righty spin.  And even though  maybe let's say  it's a little bit true,  right?  I want to be on that side.  I want to be on the side  that helps people  that are hurt.  And that's that side.  But is it really  helping people who are hurt  if you condescend  and behave paternally  to people who aren't as hurt?  Not necessarily.  I understand what you're saying  behaving paternally.  But it's not.  I mean, look,  it's a dilemma between  are you going to help somebody  or if you're not?  I think more people get helped.  Obviously, if you get stuck  in the welfare rut or whatever, 
[03:28:00]  and by the way,  there's as many white people  if not more on welfare  than black.  But, you know,  I mean, it's a tough situation.  You know, the right  wants to stop programs.  I meet people all the time  that say they're conservatives  but only fiscally.  That's a bunch of crap, man.  You've got to jump on  the liberal bandwagon  with causes.  And that's what it's about.  You know, I'm on the side  of not bombing people  that are innocent.  How about racial profiling?  Here's what the left...  The left's irrelevance to me  really becomes apparent  when it comes to things  like they say  you can't look at  a Middle Eastern male 
[03:28:30]  any differently  than you can look at  anybody else getting on a plane.  And that's just not a fact.  I agree with you.  You've got to fall  into a couple spots.  You've got to move on.  You can't go all the way.  I mean, I know  that there's a reason  because it's the same reason  that gun guys say  you know,  if you take away this  then you're going to take away...  It's the same crap.  That's why they do that.  Well, they use the same argument  the liberals use  the slippery slope argument.  The guns use...  The people use it too.  Well, if you remove this right,  we'll have this right.  Let me ask you this  if you're really conservative.  This could be the best.  I'm not saying I'm really conservative. 
[03:29:00]  I'm all for gay marriages.  That's right where I was going.  Right where I was going.  Look, if they want to have  gay unions, gay parties...  I don't care if they're married or not.  Look, that's more of a church...  The same partner rights  and the same benefits  and the same health benefits.  They should get that.  Call it what you want,  but yeah, I'm for that.  What about you, Ed?  Yeah, fine.  I'm fine with that.  You're not good righties.  We never claim to be that conservative.  Yeah, I'm right-leaning.  Much more so than left-leaning.  But I look at any subject...  That's why a lot of people go,  what are you talking about? 
[03:29:30]  You're a hypocrite.  Or they say,  oh, you bush-loving righty.  Or then they call me  a bed-wetting liberal  if I say something else.  I take what I read  and you kind of give it  your own spin,  put your own opinion on it,  get as much of the facts  as you can,  and make your own mind up.  I don't go with one side  or the other  just based on,  hey, it's the right way  of thinking  or the left way of thinking.  You've got to be  your own person.  It's tough these days  because with Fox News  and what has happened  on the right is so huge  in my mind  because of all these radio shows. 
[03:30:00]  There's like 300-and-something  righty radio shows  all over the country.  Now there's four liberal shows.  God bless them.  But if somebody checked  both of them out,  then they could be real people.  See, this is where  I've dealt with,  when I'm doing  with Comedy Central,  I had to deal  with the left constantly  and the content  of what they allow through.  Maybe the right  would do it too  if that involved  in the day-to-day  actions of show business.  Give me a for instance  so I understand  what you're saying.  They come to us,  they say don't talk  about politics  on Tough Crowd  because Jon Stewart  talks about it 
[03:30:30]  on The Daily Show.  Then they say  don't talk about race  because Chappelle  talks about it.  A perfect example,  Chappelle could say  nigger on his show.  Even black guys  on our show  couldn't say the word nigger.  It was a complete  double standard  with language,  with ideology.  And again,  I'm not saying  the right doesn't  do it either.  And talking politics,  when you get on  The Daily Show,  you're always going  to get a left-leaning  little spin  and sarcasm  because of Jon Stewart.  He's great at what he does.  He is very good.  But Colin's spin  on politics  is right.  And I heard it,  but that's why  I want to tell Norton  I don't understand  because whenever 
[03:31:00]  I threw down the show,  I heard a bunch  of righty stuff.  They did give us  a lot of leeway  with that stuff.  But what happened  was when Herzog  came back  in the last year,  a lot of liberals  wouldn't come on.  Colin loved having  left guys on.  He wanted like  Margaret Cho,  who of course,  she's great on  fucking yapping  in the media  with nobody  challenging her,  but to have  another comedian  go head to head.  I wish you would have  brought on Janine then.  Someone would have  great.  I was on the first  episode with Janine.  Janine hated her.  Yeah, but I'd like  to see a tape of that show.  She wasn't fun.  I'm not looking for funny.  I'll send you one,  but she's a comedian to me.  That's her job.  That's the asterisk.  But we're talking politics. 
[03:31:30]  The show was based  on funny firsts.  There's plenty of  brilliant liberals.  Look, Ron Cooby  is as left as you can get  and he's brilliant.  There's plenty of guys  who are qualified to me  to speak to the public.  I don't like her smugness  and how just because  it's her opinion  and it's a very  left-leaning opinion  that it's correct.  It's not always correct.  Well, listen,  I'll tell you this.  You guys probably don't.  And people listen  to your program,  hope I don't ruin  your freaking show.  No.  We go down this road  and I love the bad times.  Al Franken's show  and by the way,  when he first went on the air 
[03:32:00]  I thought it was  the worst lingo  but he's gotten a lot better  and the show's entertaining.  But on his show,  he'll play Rush's clips  and all these guys' clips  and prove that it's a lie.  That's his opinion.  He will play  the statement by Bush  for instance.  That's fantastic.  See what I'm saying?  And when you hear that stuff,  there is no two links.  And I think he does  a great job at it.  Yeah, that I appreciate.  Someone that would do.  The solution to the  blowjob problem  in the office  is we need a female.  When she gets power,  she's going to do  his boss around  her husband more.  And that's it.  Did anybody invite you  on to me for a second? 
[03:32:30]  Reese's wife, everyone.  Oh, no.  The old lady  who's not old at all.  By the way,  I have to go to...  It's nothing.  It's nothing.  You're going to go to sleep  and wake up.  That's it.  I hope so.  I promise you.  I'll see you guys  when I bring my GGL book.  I promise.  Hey, you can bring  pictures of your insights.  By the way,  hopefully you don't  wake up gagging  with a salty taste  in your mouth.  Anthony, this just in  from ELO.  Liberalism is alive  and well on XM 167.  That's Air America.  Thank you, ELO. 
[03:33:00]  I hope Eric Logan  is listening  because we would love  to have wheeze  on XM Satellite Radio.  We would absolutely  love it.  Two dudes with chip.  By the way,  167 is so cool for me  because I listen to that stuff.  And that 167 is left  and like 168 is right.  Right, yeah.  I mean, it is so weird,  Anthony.  You should try to  you can listen to it  before.  Go back and forth.  You'll hear the exact opposite.  Yeah, the same subject matter  being covered  on opposite ends  of the spectrum.  Like the Karl Rove.  Opposites.  Yeah, yeah.  So what are you going to do?  There's a lot of people  checking in.  They want to know  how you're doing health-wise  because we've talked about it 
[03:33:30]  on the air here a lot.  It's good to see you back.  I mean, I watched wheeze  kind of, I hate to say it,  but deteriorate for a while there.  And I haven't seen him  in three months.  He was living in New York  doing his cancer treatment  and I said goodbye to you,  what, like three months ago  in late April  and I saw him  for the first time last night  and it was a big relief to me,  I got to tell you.  Opie was the only guy  that went through.  I mean, Opie would come over  every week.  It was really cool.  I really didn't want any visitors  for some reason.  I didn't mind Opie  because he was like,  you know, a friend  that could sit around,  you know, without bugging me.  He lost a ton of weight. 
[03:34:00]  He lost his beard.  My beard brought a freak me  and my no chin was showing.  Right.  He had the reddest sunburn  on his neck.  He had no hair in the back.  But anyway,  I'm going to see  my Chinese lady doctor.  And you weren't talking  like this three months ago.  That's why it's great  to hear your back.  You were barely talking.  His tongue,  I just want to make it  clear to these people.  It was like just dry leather.  He couldn't eat anything.  He was getting radiation treatment  right to his face.  Bam.  Radiation to the mug is a bitch. 
[03:34:30]  I'm telling you.  Jesus.  It's a bitch.  From here to here they do.  I'm going to show you  I'll show you.  They might let you look.  They won't let you look  here when a guy's getting it.  But you know,  you got to put this mask on.  They bolt the mask  down to the table.  Yeah.  But when we go this afternoon  the lady's going to go  down my nose,  you know,  with a telescope,  telescope.  Like they're doing to him  except down my nose.  The darton,  down in there  and then see the little  where the tumor is.  Yeah,  there was a tumor  way deep in the  behind my nose.  Yeah,  the nasal passages  way down.  They couldn't operate  obviously.  But Sloan Kettering 
[03:35:00]  in New York City here is  and we've had your thing  up on our website  for,  I don't know,  four or five months now.  Kick Cancer's Ass.  Kick Cancer's Ass.  I still get letters.  OpenAnthony.com  It's up there  right at the top of the page.  I get letters  from your fans,  man.  It's so sweet  saying,  you know,  I heard you in Rochester  now I live in L.A.  and I've been here  for 15 years.  But I listened to  OpenAnthony.  I went to their website  and they found out  about it through you guys.  The dude could continue  to do his show  and the press didn't  pick up on it.  The guy could barely talk  and he's still giving  his listeners  some radio every day. 
[03:35:30]  Half an hour.  That was amazing  that he could even do that.  Hell yeah.  You know?  Jeez.  You know,  right now I'm fighting  for my bonus  that I didn't get.  I heard.  And the thing is,  I could have taken,  what do you call it again?  When you get sick?  I could have taken  disability.  You get 100%.  I could have taken  disability not been  on the radio.  Yeah.  I said I did do the radio.  You know,  a little enough.  Ways $100,000  on these bracelets  for a camp  to those cancer kids  in Rochester.  I'm still wearing mine, bro.  $100,000  on these bracelets.  And now I blew my bonus 
[03:36:00]  because while I was gone  the numbers dripped  a little bit.  And you know,  I wanted to tell them,  give me a shot.  If it doesn't come back  next time,  I'll pay you back.  But give me,  I got,  forget it,  I got bills.  I got bills.  Right.  I'm a whiner.  Dude,  your cancer bracelet  made into our  penthouse interview.  I love it.  I'm still going to pick  where is it.  Well,  we'll get it  after the show.  The guy you were  talking to on the phone  there about that  whole bonus thing  is the same guy  that fired us.  I didn't want to say.  Oh,  we don't care about him.  He called me,  I'm here.  We don't care about him anymore. 
[03:36:30]  He's a guy.  We called him  the terminator.  The terminator.  He walked in and went,  I'm sorry,  we're going to have  to terminate your contract.  Sorry to meet you  under these circumstances.  Under these circumstances.  We're going to terminate  your contract.  Best thing that ever  happened to you guys.  Yep.  Of course.  Absolutely.  Yeah,  that was the Boston F-up.  Well,  you didn't tell  Antony about  that cool restaurant  last night?  Sammy's?  We didn't get to it.  We got too busy today.  We went to Sammy's  down on the Lower East Side.  It was a great joint.  It was Romanian.  It was Romanian steaks.  But they had 
[03:37:00]  the singing waiters  night.  Not calling it  like you think.  Fun, man.  We had a ball.  It was a lot of fun.  And then they have  vodka.  In ice.  In ice.  The whole bottle's in ice.  And they bring it  to your table  and give pretty much  Just doing shots.  Nice.  That's how they do.  A little vodka.  How many do you have?  How many shots?  I had a sip.  Dancing people,  people,  you know,  from upstate  drunk lawyers  getting up.  Yeah.  Dancing fun.  It was definitely  a good joint last night.  A lot of fun.  Check that out.  In the basement.  Funky.  Yeah.  Funky fun.  All right.  Well, we've got to 
[03:37:30]  take a break.  Yes, we do.  I want to thank  Brother Weiss  for stopping by.  You're welcome, baby.  Thanks for having me.  Absolutely.  Brother Weiss is my  mentor.  And I love you, bro.  And by the way,  this is Opie Cat.  We tell everybody,  there's never been  a loyal friend.  And whatever you got,  I don't know how  Opie comes through  the radio.  He's the most loyal  friend.  I come across  what?  Like I'm an asshole.  Well, you're not.  You're not.  I'm going to blow  your cover.  Although people are  getting pissed  because I'm not  as nasty on the  radio anymore.  Because I got bored  with that.  So now I'm trying 
[03:38:00]  to show maybe  the good side.  Nothing wrong with it.  See, people love  getting nasty.  Trying to show a  little more of the  good side.  But every once in a  while, I'll still go  to the bad side.  A little bit.  A little nastiness.  I've got to be honest,  they think I'm an  asshole, Weiss.  Well, you're not.  And it's too bad  if an asshole works,  so you might want to  be, you know,  Stern's whole thing's  an act.  Maybe you should do  an act.  We try to be pretty  honest on this show.  I got that from you.  Someone was saying  that you didn't mind  Opie coming to visit  you because he was  more miserable than  you were.  That's funny.  That's funny.  That's pretty good. 
[03:38:30]  That might have been  it.  He wasn't ever as  miserable as I was.  I've loved my  friendship with Weiss  over the years,  except for the time  he almost killed me.  But besides that...  That's funny, too.  It's over now.  Oh, right.  My nose still rocks  and rocks.  It just moves around.  But after watching  him go through the  cancer stuff,  I'm not going to  complain as much.  Because even though  this guy was suffering  like you wouldn't  believe, not sleeping,  none of that crap,  getting the radiation  right to your face,  he's still doing the  video poker online.  Well, I finally  quit.  I was going to tell you,  I got so sick,  I even stopped that. 
[03:39:00]  That's when I knew  I was bad.  Man.  But I was pokering  for many, many weeks.  He was sneaking out  and playing poker  in some of these  illegal joints.  I think I told you  about that.  One of his joints  got busted.  My boy went to jail  for six days.  I don't want to  say his name.  Wow.  Yeah, a lot of those  places, they're starting  to crack down on him.  Sucks.  You know, they had a  protest.  You guys catch that  in the paper?  Yeah.  The poker protest?  The guys protesting.  Yeah, they just  want to play cards.  Yeah, in front of  the police station.  Yeah.  That's classic.  But, you know, 
[03:39:30]  next time I get the  flu or something,  I'm going to laugh at it.  I'm not going to  complain as much.  Now you're talking.  Let's go to Nick  in Buffalo.  Nick, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on,  guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, I just want to  say, Brother Weez,  it's great to hear  your voice.  You guys got booted  off in 92.9.  You know, hey, it's  awesome hearing you  guys.  Thanks, bro.  You guys rock.  Thanks.  Well, you know,  Infinity Broadcasting  has been hiding  Brother Weez for many,  many years.  I would love to get  him on XM Satellite  Radio.  Yo, you know how  fucking it is.  Or force Infinity  at least to do the  right thing and get  it in a few more 
[03:40:00]  markets.  Jesus.  You know, no  doubt, guys.  They can syndicate  Anthony and I to  almost 20 cities.  I think they can  syndicate Weez to a  few.  Thank you, bro.  A bunch of assholes  over there.  Thanks, Nick.  No problem.  Guys, welcome.  All right.  Let's say hi to  Mike.  Mike, what's going  on?  Hey, Brother Weez,  Mike Veneman.  How are you, buddy?  How I know that  name?  Oh, the comedian.  Yes.  Mike Veneman, the  comedian.  Oh, man, I am good  to hear you back again,  brother.  I swear to God, I'm  in Detroit this weekend  performing and I just  want to, because I  remember Opie way back  when I was in there 
[03:40:30]  doing an interview and  he was just a young  little colt.  Veneman is a  journeyman comedian.  A little high-voiced  Opie interviewing him.  No, no, no, no.  I was just...  He wasn't interviewing  I was in with Weez.  Oh, I would do  whatever Weez said.  I was one of these  guys that runs around  for us now.  I was getting the  coffee, getting the  donuts.  Really?  I've been doing this  for 20 years.  It's too bad we have  to go because we  should tell some of  the Sam Kinison stories,  the amazing Sam Kinison  stories.  The highlight of my  radio career.  Me too.  Getting to live  through that.  Well, Weez, you take  care.  Thanks, Mike.  I said, hey, get  better, brother. 
[03:41:00]  I'm not thinking  about you.  Thanks a million, Mike.  Have a good set in  Detroit.  All right, buddy.  All right.  Yeah, this is what  we do at the end  of our show.  That noise means  you've got to get  off?  Yeah, it's like  the Mario Brothers.  I was wondering.  That's some fucking  crap.  Yeah, it's like the  end of the game and  then it starts getting  faster and faster  because they cut us  right off.  Really?  At 11.  Why?  Computer, master  computer.  Because with the  replays, it has to  the beginning and end  of the show, I have to  butt right up against  each other.  Strange. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah, I know.  Being in this  European Anthony  friggin' network, you  could do as long as  you wanted.  You would think, but  we're ending a show  on Monday, by the way.  I understand.  We're going to make  the announcement  Monday.  The band is getting  back together.  We'll have details  on Monday.  Can't make the  announcement, though.  It would cost like  five grand every time  we say it.  Five grand every time  we mention their  names.  Don't do it.  You're a lovely  company there, Weez.  Oh, is that?  Your lovely company.  After this set, maybe  I'm not there either.  Don't worry.  We'll get you on XM  sooner than later  then, you know?  Thank you.  Are we going to go  see the Aristocrats  today?  Absolutely.  I think it's only 
[03:42:00]  playing in one theater.  I got the times  in two theaters.  Near you?  One's near me  and one isn't.  Okay.  All right.  Beautiful.  We're going to go  to the hospital  for the update?  Yeah, you coming?  Fuck yeah.  Fuck, that fuck  is weirding me out.  Peculiar.  All right.  Took a while  to get used to it.  It really did.  Anthony, have fun  in Atlantic City.  Thank you, everybody.  Give us a full report  on Monday.  That 9G is in your  pocket.  We'll see if I can  turn it into a...  God damn.  All right.  Bye-bye.  This includes  a podcast.  It will be an Anthony show. </pre>
