<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly off-tangent.  It began with a discussion of absurd news stories: a runaway bride faking her kidnapping and construction workers fabricating a buried treasure tale.  Callers shared their opinions and added their own bizarre anecdotes, including a Long Island barbecue murder and a beer-spill incident at comedian Jimmy's Boston show.  Jimmy himself was a significant presence, recounting graphic and sexually explicit details of his encounters with female fans, including one involving twins.  The hosts interjected with personal anecdotes, including Opie's extensive shirt collection and Anthony's unusual toilet paper usage, which was a recurring theme.  The segment also featured listener-submitted audio clips.

The show then transitioned to a discussion of toilet splashback, fueled by a particularly disgusting Hilton hotel bathroom stall encountered during a signing event.  This led to playing and discussing audio clips from the Ron and Fez show, showcasing Fez's emotional breakdown on air following his grandmother's death and a perceived slight from a coworker.  Ron's highly offensive defense of Fez against program director criticism followed.  The conversation shifted to Brother Weezer's battle with nasal cancer, including playing audio of his treatment and a heartfelt call from his son. A contentious phone call from a listener, Mary Flood, advocating for alternative medicine sparked a heated argument with Weezer's wife, Doreen.  Opie also mentioned assisting Weezer with a move.

The show then reviewed the Rosie O'Donnell movie, commenting on the absurdity of local news teases and the difference in commercial breaks between regular and satellite radio.  A humorous parody song, "Silence of the Lambs: The Musical," was played, and a caller, James, discussed the addictive video game Everquest ("Evercrack").  The segment moved to a discussion of *The Shining* and creepy hotels, with Opie recounting unsettling hotel experiences and a call from his brother, Joe, about a childhood prank involving *Psycho*.  A listener shared a Hotel Colorado haunting experience, and another, Road Dog, talked about an adult film drive-in.

The hosts then reviewed the poorly-received movie "Riding the Bus with My Sister," making numerous offensive jokes about the portrayal of the intellectually disabled character. Callers shared their opinions, including one, Jim, with a personal connection to the topic.  Clips from the movie were played.  The show then dismissed another movie as "a non-movie," making crude jokes about the actress's appearance and a fictional interracial couple. A graphic call from Dee Dee detailed a weekend sexual encounter with her UPS driver, Steve, including bondage and other sexual acts.

The show featured Andy Gore in studio, recounting his Chiller Theater convention experiences and introducing Katie Ketchup, known for her ketchup obsession and tattoos, and Jungle Jim Kim. Andy retrieved a pickled punk previously given to Opie and gave the hosts novelty t-shirts.  A newscaster's mispronunciation of "Laura Bush" as "Homer Bush" was discussed, followed by a Robert Kelly clip and a promise to play Laura Bush stand-up material.  The segment ended with a discussion of an offensive Hitler t-shirt and smoothies.

A significant portion of the broadcast focused on a "F.U." segment with angry caller messages.  This transitioned into a discussion of Laura Bush's performance at a Washington press dinner, playing several clips of her jokes, which ranged from self-deprecating to risqué.  Callers debated the humor and speculated on the writer.  The segment also featured discussions about other celebrities, Rosie O'Donnell among them, and caller observations.  Andy's upcoming tattoo show appearance and a doll he created of Merle (Gigi's brother) in a compromising position were mentioned.  The show concluded with further caller feedback.

[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  And yeah, we're back.  Where have you been?  Woo!  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for profit.  Here it comes!  Here it comes!  The Opie and Anthony program.  The Opie and Anthony program.  The Opie and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bat to my brain. 
[00:04:00]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  I want my coffee.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that fact.  Tim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down syndrome children.  No, baby!  It's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Okay, terrific. 
[00:04:30]  Who taught you how to do this stuff?  You, all right?  I learned it by watching you.  Opie and Anthony run!  I got nowhere else to go! 
[00:05:00]  I got nowhere else to go!  That doesn't look like this.  Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck!  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous!  Hey, welcome to the Opie and Anthony program!  Oh!  It's Monday! 
[00:05:30]  Woo-hoo!  You gotta act extra excited on Monday.  Yeah.  Because usually people are dragging a little bit, so you make believe you're really, really  awake and ready for another fine program.  I almost ate my whole bagel before the show started, but I can't just leave this.  That little bite?  I have to eat it.  I noticed you have a very puffy shirt on today.  Is it puffy?  It has a little puff to it.  Yeah.  It's one of those shirts that are, like, pre-wrinkled. 
[00:06:00]  I don't know.  It's all the rage, Opie.  I don't know.  Your wardrobe is growing by the day.  Yes.  I'm sort of keeping a mental note, and I haven't seen a rotation.  You have a mental closet?  I haven't seen a rotation yet.  It's starting to scare me, man.  A rotation.  I mean, you're lucky if you get two different shirts from me in one week.  This is true.  You not only do five different shirts a week, then those five shirts go, I guess, back in 
[00:06:30]  the back of the rotation and doesn't see the light of day for months.  Right.  How big is your closet now, man?  Since I moved, I got a lot of closet space.  Didn't used to.  Had, like, a little closet.  Didn't have much jeans.  Drawers full of T-shirts.  And this is going to go back for the older listeners, not that much older, but since  our L.A. trip, I guess.  Every time you come in with a new shirt, we're all kind of looking at you.  Or I guess it's me. 
[00:07:00]  I guess no one else is in on this one yet.  They will be, though.  I have a way of doing that to people.  I know.  You ask me.  I'm like, well, is that one of your Rodeo Drive shirts?  No, Opie.  This is just a Hugo Boss bought locally.  Have you worn any of your Rodeo Drive stuff yet?  Um, no, I haven't.  I haven't been out for anything that I should, you know, put that on for.  And you know damn well not to wear it to work, right?  No, not to work.  No, no, no, no. 
[00:07:30]  People will start calling you Noah if you do that, I guess.  Oh, please.  All right.  He was trying to do something, trying to make some kind of statement for this clothing.  I could give a shit.  His statement was, I love cock.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Jimmy couldn't sit out on that one.  No.  Full mouthful of food.  Had to get that out.  Had to get in on that one.  Had to get the ha-ha out.  How was Boston, Jimmy?  Oh, I love Boston, man. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  I love Boston.  I can't tell you how much I enjoy working there.  I was reading the message board and a lot of people went to see you up there in Boston.  Great reviews.  You killed, they said.  You killed.  That club is just phenomenal.  It's a perfect comedy club.  It's a box.  Yeah.  It's just a big square with like 500 people in it.  And of course, Boston chicks are phenomenal.  I heard something, though.  I was reading some of the people that were up there that there was this one chick who 
[00:08:30]  was totally drunk and like smelled really bad.  And some of the message board people had to sit next to her.  Really?  And she spilt her beer on one of the message board guys' laps and then was picked up the  glass like nothing happened, I guess, and was drinking out of an empty glass the rest  of the night.  And she stunk.  So she just stunk.  I didn't see her.  A stinking drunk whore.  Hello, Boston.  I had a lovely young lady show up at one show, though.  You got to hear this. 
[00:09:00]  Is this the story that you just told me?  Oh, yeah.  Completely true.  Yeah.  You haven't heard this one yet, Anne.  No.  I just happened this weekend.  Young gal shows up and says, at the first show, she's like, oh, I love this show.  She's like, oh, by the way, my sister gave you head.  Oh.  And I'm like, really?  And she's like, yes.  I'm like, oh, cool.  And I'm kind of joking with her.  I'm like, well, did she badmouth me?  And she's like, no.  She's like, I got to be honest.  I'm a little jealous.  And I'm like, you are, are you?  Oh, no.  Swear to God.  Wow.  It's the, this is the photo negative of Philly for me. 
[00:09:30]  Like, I strike out horribly there, and here, it just happens.  It just falls in your lap, so to speak.  Ball.  So, we're chit-chatting, and she goes, I'd like to try some yellow discipline.  And I'm thinking, oh, great.  What?  Yeah, this is not going to happen.  She's just talking.  Using catchphrases.  Yeah, just being cute.  Do you really?  So, she's like, yeah, I'm going to come back tomorrow.  I'm like, okay.  So, she, there she is the next night, front and center.  Drinking a lot of water.  Yeah.  Are we all ready? 
[00:10:00]  Comes up after the show with her friend, who I think is going to be a horrible C-blocker.  Right.  So, I go into the club next door with them.  We have a little beverage, and lo and behold, turns out that her twin sister, her twin, performed  oral treats on me.  And you remembered her?  Yeah.  I sure did.  And, I sure did.  Certainly did.  Where's the twin sister from?  I think it's the West Coast. 
[00:10:30]  It was either Sacramento or San Francisco, one of the two awful cities.  And you have no idea.  I don't know.  It was actually one of the, no, no, it was, I stand correct.  It was Sacramento.  That's right.  Sacramento.  You do remember?  Do you remember?  Yeah.  Sacramento had an S in it, and it was West.  That would be San-Cramento.  Sacramento.  Right.  Of course it was.  And what a lovely gal.  So, her twin sister comes and goes back to the room, and lo and behold, right down.  What a good egg.  I couldn't believe it was happening.  And then, I lay, she's like, I want to try some yellow. 
[00:11:00]  And I'm like, you do?  She was for real.  So, I lay a towel on the bed.  And, you know, we fool her out a little bit, and she goes, I think you should lay on the  bed now.  Oh, boy.  And I lay on the bed, and it wasn't a full gusher, but it was a little squirt gun.  And very hot.  Where did you take it?  On the chest.  On the chest.  And it trickles into the neck.  Wow.  Maybe it's the same girl, though.  Sounds like that, um... 
[00:11:30]  I thought of that.  Sounds like that Rosie movie, Riding Jim's Face with My Sister.  Oh, God.  Damn, that was quick.  You are something else.  There's chicks in California, and then Boston.  The furthest, pretty much the furthest you could get apart in this grand land of ours.  And there, Jimmy's getting his dick sucked.  I'm thinking it might be the same girl.  You think?  Same.  She might be a little wacky.  She said they're not identical.  I asked her, like, do you guys look alike?  She's like, no, kind of, but not exactly. 
[00:12:00]  Like, I think she would have said, yeah, exactly, just in case I were there.  But, yeah, little yellow treats.  And then we ordered some room service.  I had a meal.  She had a cookie.  A cookie.  I swear to God, she wanted a cookie.  And then they sent us four cookies.  She took the other three cookies and skedaddled.  And got out of there.  I didn't ask her to leave.  Wow.  She said, I gotta go.  Like, all right.  How is that?  Did you pinch yourself?  Yeah.  Well, I elbowed my own ribs by, golly.  Riding Jim's face with my sister.  Amazing.  I am super fun. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, I love Boston, man.  Apparently so.  Let's go to Rick in Boston.  Morning, boo-boo-boo-boo.  Hello there, Rick.  What's up, guys?  Hi, Rick.  Hello, Rick.  Hi.  I wanted to tell Jimmy, dude, you were fucking hilarious, dude.  Oh, thank you, man.  Yeah, I saw you Friday night, man.  I was fucking laughing the whole way home.  Oh, thanks, buddy.  Yeah.  Yeah, you rock, man.  All right, I got nothing.  I'm punching out.  That's the whole reason you called?  That was it. 
[00:13:00]  Pretty much.  I mean, like, I watched Family Guy last night, and then...  Oh, what did...  Hey, we lost every phone?  Wow, we lost all the phones.  What?  That's a new one.  What happened?  Did we mess up over there?  We just lost all the phones.  Was it your fault, Danny?  I was about to ask him if he liked the Family Guy last night.  Nathaniel's selling him down the river.  I go, it's your fault, Danny?  And Danny's shaking his head no.  And Nathaniel's just going, yes, it's Danny's fault.  Well, you hit something.  You hit a button, didn't you?  You must have hit something, right?  He hit something.  Is there a button?  I've never seen that happen.  I don't know.  That was weird. 
[00:13:30]  All right.  Well, Anthony, you've been hinting...  Well, where do we start today?  There's so much...  I was going to...  A lot of stuff.  I'm thinking about the Rosie O'Donnell movie.  I'm also thinking we've got to go with the kook first.  We've got to go with the Runaway Bride.  Runaway Bride.  They make it sound like a fun, lighthearted movie or something.  Runaway Bride.  Well, it was the movie starring, what, Julia Roberts, was it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're not at the altar.  These storylines are a little different between the two.  Just a tad.  And you bastards, you thought the guy killed her.  Of course I did. 
[00:14:00]  You bastards.  What do you think?  Dude, 99% of the time, the husband killed her.  I mean, this is ridiculous.  And we were right.  He should have.  She's awful.  He should have killed her.  Oh.  What a bit...  What a kook.  First of all, this is a prime example of someone who just isn't thinking rationally.  They're just not thinking.  She had no clue that if she just disappears, that her fiancé, this man that she loves, I 
[00:14:30]  guess, is going to just have everybody's finger pointing at him going, oh, here's the latest  guy that killed his fiancé.  Here he is.  And have to deal with that.  But she just didn't think about that.  She took off, said that the wedding was a little too much, too big for her.  She needed time alone to think it out.  A little too much stress.  A little too much stress.  She spontaneously just decided to leave, which the police found out was bull.  She bought the bus ticket a few days in advance, set up transportation to get to the bus. 
[00:15:00]  And then she took off and went to Vegas, where she hooked up with some Hispanic man and white  woman that she then got on a bus with and went to Albuquerque with.  And then she made a 911 call, told the police she had been abducted in some phony 911 call.  And then the cops came and got her, and after, of course, a little questioning, she folded 
[00:15:30]  on the questioning.  I got her 911.  Hendry, I don't know, Hendry.  I think you'll fold on the questioning.  Yeah, so she, I mean.  Can I back up for a second?  I got her 911 call.  Oh, you got the frantic 911 call?  Yeah, listen to how phony this sounds.  And that's all he got of this?  They don't have the whole call? 
[00:16:00]  Liar, liar, pants on fire.  I say.  She, uh, she, she called up.  Cops came and got her.  They questioned her, and after, um, like an hour or so, uh, she said, they said to her,  and I love this cop move.  They're like, because she, she had said she was abducted.  It was a, a, um, uh, red van, I think she said, um, or a white van.  And then after an hour of questioning, the cops just go, Jennifer, um, we don't have to  look for a van, do we? 
[00:16:30]  They just, they pulled that move.  And she just went, no.  Liar.  We don't, not like, hey, come on, you're bullshit.  Jennifer, we, we don't have to look for that van, do we?  No.  It was funny, I was, I was watching all the, the, the clips too, and one of the newswomen  were saying, and it was very obvious that she cut her own hair.  Yeah, she cut her own hair.  You can just imagine how awful that looked.  Oh.  An Elo cut.  Well, they said she just panicked and just hopped into a black trans am and just drove away. 
[00:17:00]  No, she was dancing down that aisle.  Knockers bouncing all over the joint.  Oh, brother.  Yeah, so they, um, they found out she was, uh, she was lying.  Like, like they don't, she didn't watch TV at all?  No, you never, you can't lie to the cops like this, especially on such a, uh, a flimsy story. 
[00:17:30]  The cops always know.  The story falls apart.  The more, and they even said, the more she told it, the worse and more different the story gets.  Yeah.  It doesn't work like television, like a movie.  It works like those goddamn shows I love on Discovery and stuff.  Those cop shows.  Cold case files.  I love that.  20 years later, this guy's like changed his life, turned it around.  He was 17 when some bitch got mouthy and he hit her over the head with a golf club perhaps or something. 
[00:18:00]  And 20 years later, uh, they find something and some go-getter detective decides to check out, uh, some more evidence and they drag him in.  That's how shit works.  It's not like, uh, these, these movies where you can lie to the cops and get away with it.  It doesn't work.  And this woman, her story completely fell apart.  And, uh, oh, you see that other story about those two guys that said they found money up in Massachusetts?  Yeah, those, those dopes.  These dopes.  And they're on every news channel.  This is another example of the same thing. 
[00:18:30]  It's like, just shut your mouth.  Shut up, stupid.  They, uh, they were doing some construction in a yard where there was a big barn.  And, uh, they said they were digging in the ground.  And, uh, lo and behold, they find this wooden box in the ground.  They open it up and there's these cans.  These, uh, I guess coffee can looking things.  Where they open up and find these old, old money from the 18 and early 1900s.  Uh, dollar bills, silver certificates, uh, uh, with a face value of a few thousand dollars. 
[00:19:00]  But, uh, uh, collector's value of over a hundred thousand dollars.  And they had it appraised and everything.  And now they're on Fox News, CNN.  They're doing the whole circuit saying how they dug up this buried treasure.  Oh, it's a feel-good type of story.  It was a great story.  The graphic they put, treasure hunters and treasure found.  And these guys are standing around taking photo ops with this money and everything.  One day later, the cops arrest the two guys.  Turns out they were doing work on this guy's barn.  And, uh, they found the tin cans hidden in the barn. 
[00:19:30]  So now, uh, uh, it seems that they, they, the owner of the barn didn't know about this.  But, it's his money anyway.  And these guys decided they're going to concoct this story.  But how do they get caught if the owner didn't know that the money was in his barn?  The cops.  They said the longer they questioned these guys, the worse their story got.  They said, they said that the hole that they dug before they hit the box varied with their stories from two inches to, like, a foot and a half. 
[00:20:00]  Okay.  And, uh, they, they said they were digging, uh, to get a rock out of the way from something they had to build.  Then the other guy said they were planting a tree.  And, like, the stories just didn't, uh, mesh up.  That's how the cops will always get you.  The cops are good.  They just keep asking questions.  They keep asking the same questions.  Keep asking and asking and asking.  And you just trip up.  I was digging, we were digging up a rock.  We had to dig up a rock because we were putting a fence up.  A rock?  A rock.  I thought you said a tree.  All right.  All right.  And then, like, two hours later.  Yeah.  So, you were digging, um, I guess, uh, what were you doing with the, uh, the shovel? 
[00:20:30]  Well, we had to plant a tree.  Fuck a rock.  We were planting a rock.  Okay, I did it.  They always trip up.  Why didn't they just take the money?  They wanted to be media stars, too?  They wanted to be, hey, who'd have money to be famous?  I guess.  You get a story like that, maybe, um, maybe one of the local reporters up there in Massachusetts  went into the police station to read the blotter, to put it in his local paper, and said, wow,  you got this treasure story.  That's pretty good.  Let me try to get, and the news guy, he wants to be famous.  So he's like, I could get, give this to the AP. 
[00:21:00]  It makes the AP.  Then the local, uh, Fox and, um, uh, the CNN people pick it up.  Before you know it, it's a huge feel-good story.  Hey, we gotta, you guys wanna come on, uh, the air with us?  Hey, uh, Bobby, you wanna come on?  It's fuckin' great.  We're gonna be famous.  We could probably have him on here.  Yeah.  Oh, of course.  All right, we gotta go back to the, uh, the runaway bride story, cause, uh, Jim's making  a good point here.  Jim, go ahead.  How much you wanna bet this asshole still marries her?  That's what he's saying, right?  The wedding is not canceled. 
[00:21:30]  I haven't read that yet, but, you know, if he still marries her, he's a fuckin' moron.  I think he's saying something like he forgives her or something like that.  Oh, I can, I can understand forgiving her, but if he's stupid enough to marry her, he  is the, he's a bigger asshole than she is.  What an idiot.  What a great, uh, start to a marriage.  Your, your fiancé running off on you, and then, uh, uh, making everyone accuse you of  killing her, like we did.  Yeah.  Of course.  Would've been a lot more fun if she turned up dead. 
[00:22:00]  Absolutely.  Just a shoe with blood in it somewhere.  Oh!  Those big eyes poking out.  She must've been choked.  No!  Why?  Why do you think?  Look at those eyes.  Popeye.  And then the cops would follow this guy around forever, making his life a living hell.  And just imagine her, all of a sudden, she did die while she was away.  Oh, how about that, right?  They find her body somewhere.  Because she's on these buses going, you know, these buses are scary to begin with.  Who knows?  You run into, like, one of these undesirables.  Next thing you know, you are dead in a desert somewhere. 
[00:22:30]  Now, now they point the finger at this guy for the next few years.  He can't go anywhere.  But he's forgiving her, and it's looking like they'll probably get married eventually.  He said it's not canceled.  It's postponed the wedding.  And of course, then everyone will be applauding him for being that good guy.  How the hell do you go to a wedding like this?  Because it's supposed to be some huge gala event.  600 people.  600 guests.  28 people standing for the wedding.  28 bridesmaids and whatever they call those other guys. 
[00:23:00]  Guys.  Groomsmen.  Just guys.  Ushers.  Ugh.  And then you're going to be sitting.  Everyone's going to be sitting in that church, watching her walk down the aisle going,  Oh, this is the bitch that drove everybody crazy, that didn't want to get married.  Didn't want to get married so much, she ran off.  What?  What?  Leave.  This guy should run for his life.  It's over.  The episode is bouncing all over the joint.  Boy, ass was wiggling, too.  My ass was wiggling, too. 
[00:23:30]  I've got a lot of guys listening to XM illegally.  Let's go to Canada.  Bruce, what's up?  Hey, boys.  How are you?  Pretty good, Bruce.  What pissed me out this weekend is seeing how the way CNN covered this story,  just trying to make it some, like, trying to get into our emotions and everything.  I just thought it was really stupid.  Oh, did CNN try to get a new angle on it?  What was her emotional state?  Why did she leave?  Well, we're going to do a whole story on women's anxiety with getting married.  Shut up.  Runaway brides in our neighborhood. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, runaway brides.  We'll get into that.  Always the local tie-in with your local news station.  The local tie-in.  You know, they had one with the retard movie last night.  I want to ask Bruce one more question.  He's from Canada.  How jealous are they?  They have to live off our news stories.  You never have a real good Canadian story.  You never hear about a really good Canadian story on CNN.  They're all watching CNN up there, and they have to listen to how cool the United States is.  They have a few good killings up there every so often.  Very rare.  They had a media blackout in the last major case there, which was the Bernardo case. 
[00:24:30]  It was a complete media blackout in Canada, so they got no news.  How does that work?  How does a media blackout work when they're right up there?  Nathan.  What's up, Nathan from Canada?  Another one.  Yes.  I'm doing good.  You all being happy and little Jimmy?  Hi, fan.  Well, thank you.  What do you got there, Nathan?  I've been a faithful listener since your free play back in December, and I've got to say,  the wow works.  I've been doing it every week, and on Wednesday, I've seen titties. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course the wow works.  We know that.  We've been doing it for seven, eight years now, even up there in Canada.  No, thanks, Nathan.  We appreciate it.  If you want to get a wow sticker, go to opianthony.com, and just send a self-addressed stamped envelope off,  and we send you out stickers, okay?  And it does work. 
[00:25:30]  Love the show.  Thanks, buddy.  Bye.  All right, let's go to Tennessee.  Neil, what's up?  Oh, not much, man.  I'll be honest.  If one of your friends brought you a picture of that broad that ran away for her wedding,  would you not look at it and go,  that's the bitch that's going to be throwing dead animals on my porch when I break up with her?  Right or wrong?  Yeah, with those big eyes.  Thank God.  You could just look at it and you're like, oh, God, this is going to go fucking bad.  You haven't even met her yet.  We should play guess the mental illness.  Oh, shit.  You know, quit looking at the light.  For God's sakes. 
[00:26:00]  Put on some fucking glasses.  My goodness.  She really does have owl eyes.  I love you guys.  Been listening to it for three weeks, man.  Just thinking about listening to regular radio makes me want to fucking dip myself in shit.  Doing a great job.  Right on, Neil.  Thank you, buddy.  Bye, Neil.  Spread the virus for us, all right?  Yeah, I mean, she's got something going on.  We all have stress and pressure in our lives, but we're not doing kooky things like that.  How tough is our life?  Apparently very tough. 
[00:26:30]  Very tough.  They're rich, right?  She had to leave.  I don't think you have that kind of wedding and not have a few bucks.  But what was the big problem?  Just the wedding?  Maybe that's got to come out.  Maybe the guy is a complete asshole.  You know?  Nah.  I don't know.  He looks like a do-gooder.  A do-gooder?  He looks like the type of guy that just can't do wrong.  I don't...  You know, I got to commend him for getting through the situation like he did and going on the news and talking.  Because if I was in that situation, I would be so paranoid that they're going to think I killed her. 
[00:27:00]  And you in your head know you didn't because you didn't.  But I would...  I have this, like, guilt thing.  Sometimes when I walk into an empty store and I have a big jacket on, I walk around with my hands really far away from me so they don't think I'm stealing something.  I know I'm not going to steal anything.  But I don't...  Or if I walk into a store and I didn't buy anything, they don't have what I want, and I leave right away, I kind of linger by the door a little. 
[00:27:30]  Kind of like, look, I'm comfortable standing here.  I'm not trying to flee your store.  Because I don't want them to think, hey, that was suspicious.  It kind of left quickly.  I would be the worst under a lie detector.  I'd be horrible.  Because you're bringing up something.  I was at Tower Records this weekend.  I didn't bring it.  I didn't buy anything.  But I felt like I was stealing something.  I'm leaving the store.  I had this weird guilt.  You do.  You get this, like, this thing that they're going to think I'm stealing something.  If I'm wearing my big jacket and I put my hands in my pockets and I'm in, like, an aisle in a store, I'm like, oh, fuck. 
[00:28:00]  They're going to think I just shoved something in my pocket.  And that's...  I don't know where that comes from.  Yeah.  But I've got it.  So if I had to go on the news, I'd be like, yes, we're all very concerned.  We hope she returns quickly.  Look, I didn't kill the bitch.  I swear to God, I didn't kill it.  I would just lose it.  I'd break...  I would be so bad.  I didn't.  That's really good.  You ever been leaving a store with stuff you paid for and the stuff goes off?  You ever had the alarm go off after you paid for your items? 
[00:28:30]  Oh, I...  Oh, the thing.  The thing's going off.  I never know what to do.  I just point at my white skin and they go, ah, go ahead, son.  Oh, Bill from Jersey.  What's up, Bill?  Hey, shake it up, guys.  Shake it up.  Hello, Bill.  Anthony, you're a tool.  You ass.  You said last week he so killed her.  He's so guilty.  Oh, I know.  Yeah, let's pull the tape from last week's show.  There's no need to pull the tape. 
[00:29:00]  Pull the tape.  There's no need to pull the tape.  I completely acknowledge the fact that I had the open mind in this situation.  You didn't have shit.  I didn't have nothing on that one.  You're right.  Hope was all over it.  You screwed up again.  Bill, Bill, so you were at home going, well, I bet she ran off on the guy.  Absolutely.  Why would I feel the guy was lying?  Guys don't lie.  Come on.  You're lying.  You're lying.  I'll admit it.  Of course I thought the guy killed her.  Absolutely.  She looked very killable in those photos.  All right, let's go to Georgia.  Craig? 
[00:29:30]  Hey, all in, hey, what are you doing to me?  Hi, fella.  What's up, Craig?  Hey, man, this whole thing is staged.  All they want is a little stage time, a little, you know, fame.  A publicity for a wedding?  Yeah, come on, man.  It's not like they're shock jocks.  She's a shock jock.  I was kidnapped.  Oh, in his right mind, we keep this bitch.  I'd slap her, throw a hold on her, and leave and get the next pretty one down the road, man.  Punch it out.  All right.  You know what you got to do? 
[00:30:00]  You got to marry her.  If you're the guy, you marry her.  On your honeymoon, you just grab her by the back of the hair and just plow it in the  back door and go, now this is what you're getting every fucking night, this is what  you're going to get.  He's what?  Why are you looking at me like that?  Because I think then you can kill her and no one will think you did it.  He's nuts if he marries her.  Simple as that.  That's crazy.  But of course, it's going to be the right thing to do, and his family and friends are  going to applaud him for his decision, but they don't have to live with this bitch.  No.  Fast forward five years when the whole intense love thing starts fading away. 
[00:30:30]  Man, this is going to be a cuckoo house.  Oh, boy.  Imagine if they have a kid.  She can't handle a wedding.  Yeah, she's going to be one of those that the kid's strapped in the minivan driving  down the boat ramp.  Yeah, I was going to say, start running the bathwater.  Bathing her little kids.  Hey, wait a minute.  We're moving backwards.  Where's mom going?  Say, mommy.  She's running along the shoreline. 
[00:31:00]  Let's go to Todd on Long Island.  Todd.  Hey, you guys got a crazy story out there today, huh?  Which one?  The barbecue guy.  Barbecue in North Amityville.  I didn't even see it.  Oh, some guy's just grilling.  Some guys at the backyard barbecue just grilling, and someone walks up to him out of nowhere  and just blasts him in the head and runs off.  And Ben's like, did you see this story?  This is unbelievable.  You guys got to talk about it today, Anthony and I. 
[00:31:30]  Because we're from Long Island.  We're like, dude, it's North Amityville.  North Amityville?  This is some kind of freaking gang hit or something.  Like, nah, dude, it looked like a good neighborhood.  I saw a Mercedes.  Right.  The guy that shot, the guy probably just stole it.  All right.  You know what?  This twat needs to go to jail.  Yeah.  She really does.  And even if they don't send her to jail, they need to give her a fucking bill for all  the man hours that were wasted.  That's what they did with that college student that said she was abducted, and they found  out she was lying.  They charged her for the police time, you know, and it amounts to a few hundred grand.  If they can have a wedding for 600 people, they can afford it. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  She's not going to do jail time.  You watch.  No, it won't be jail time.  But they'll probably charge her with something, especially since they found out she had planned  it in advance.  It wasn't just on a whim.  All right.  I hope so.  All right, boys.  I've got to go back to work.  Oh, sorry.  For advance planning, what a shoddy job.  She didn't leave with enough money.  That stupid haircut ploy.  Saying you're abducted and then cracking after an hour of questioning.  And we now know she's a racist.  Well, she said that she was abducted by a Hispanic gentleman and a white woman, though. 
[00:32:30]  She added it in that it was a white woman also.  But she couldn't commit to her racism.  Right, right.  But these were people that she had met in Vegas.  And I guess, you know, a nice woman she is.  She's trying to pin the blame on them.  But, yeah, I'm surprised she went with Hispanic.  Usually the white people go black.  They say, ah, some black guy.  We've all seen good fellas.  You know why you say some black guy?  You know who took that truck outside the diner? 
[00:33:00]  You know why you say some black guy, too?  Because it's very hard to describe the person.  Really?  Yeah, Hispanic, you can describe a little bit.  A little bit better than a black person.  Really?  So you feel like you're off the hook by just saying, hey, I was kidnapped by a black person.  Well, what do you look like?  Ah.  Jesus.  My God.  Oh, like I'm wrong?  Like I'm wrong.  Yeah.  Sure.  There's a good one.  I think what you're saying here is that certain people in certain races all look alike. 
[00:33:30]  Is that what you're trying to say?  Well, if you're going to pick one race that might have a lot of people that look similar,  that would be the one.  That's all I'm saying.  So Julio looks just like Denzel.  Julio.  Yeah.  Right.  You best backpedal or something.  Whew.  It's just easier.  I'm just talking, you know.  I think white people do it.  I'm just talking as the person that might be in this situation trying to figure out how 
[00:34:00]  do I cover all my bases.  That's awesome.  I think white people accuse black people of crimes when they've done it themselves.  Because what the media shows blacks in such a negative light as far as crime is concerned,  that it would be easier for the police to believe that a black person did it.  All right.  Asian would have been the easiest.  Oh, true.  See, now if you're going for description.  Oh, you're so right about that.  Hey, a little bull hairdo and went, bang, bang, bang.  That's all I know. 
[00:34:30]  Bill from Arizona, what's up?  All wacky.  Hello.  What's up, Bill?  I just wanted to tell Jimmy that you officially have become my idol over the weekend.  Word of mouth, pussy, that's the way to go.  American Idol.  Thank you.  Oh, from sister to sister.  Thank you, sir.  Yeah.  Appreciate it.  Punching out.  All right.  All right.  Spanning the country, too.  It's amazing.  Sisters on opposite sides of the nation.  Mm-hmm.  And there's Jimmy as the common bond.  That's right.  Bonding them together with a certain glue.  That's right.  That human toilet they both shared. 
[00:35:00]  I think it's the same chick.  I would love to know more about this girl.  Yeah, me too.  There's something going on there.  I'll find out.  My sister did you, or whatever.  Because her I know I never fooled around with them.  I would have remembered.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Let's go to Eric in Baltimore.  Eric.  Hi.  How's it going, guys?  What's up?  You in Baltimore?  I just wanted to say...  Hey, what?  You in Baltimore?  Yes.  Okay.  I just wanted to say, now would be the perfect time to kill your wife.  The media will never expect you.  Oh, she just ran away. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  A little bit of a wreck.  All right.  We've got to go backwards a little bit in the program.  Danielle from Boston.  Danielle.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Are you the one that smelled?  No, I'm not the one that smelled.  I was sitting diagonally across from her, and she spilled the freaking beer on my lap.  Oh, you're the one that got the beer spilt on her.  Yeah.  And then she was all drunk, trying to drink out of the empty glass.  Oh, my God.  It was so funny.  I couldn't smell her, but the guy sitting across from me obviously could. 
[00:36:00]  And he was, like, basically trying to sit on his chick's lap.  Yeah, he said he was so...  Oh, my God.  He was trying to move over so far.  He was sitting on his chick's lap because this girl's dunk just smelled so bad.  Like beer or BO, are they saying?  He said, like, BO.  I think maybe BO, yeah.  Yeah.  But I love little Jimmy.  I am so hot for him.  He took his picture with me.  Did I?  I was freaking out.  I wanted to stand there and, like, totally not leave.  But Club Soda Kenny was, like, screaming at people to keep moving.  Move on, people. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, it was so funny.  I'm like, oh, my God.  You cannot mistake that voice.  You have a limited time to spend with the legend.  Take your money out and go.  This abuses people.  And, boy, does it work.  It was funny.  So, wait.  What do you look like, miss?  My picture's on black bag.  Of course, I'm a tool, and death of a photo op, I had my freaking eye shot in the picture.  Are you a pretty gal?  Yeah, I think so.  I mean, I'm not ugly.  I had short, like, brownish-black hair.  I had that black tank top on that only had one shoulder. 
[00:37:00]  I think I saw her picture last night when I was trolling through the pictures.  Yeah, I posted it with the pictures of the drunk chick.  Well, don't email it to me at yellowtreats at AOL.com.  It's not about this.  It's about the radio show.  I have tried to email you, and you never write back.  I'm sorry.  Uh-oh.  There's a picture of the drunk girl, too, by the way, on there, if you keep going.  Hey, Jimmy, why wouldn't you write her back?  He's fine if I know I'm a girl.  Jimmy brags how he writes all girls back.  I am so his biggest fan. 
[00:37:30]  There is no...  All right, go to the next one.  Right there.  No, hold on.  Go back.  See that chick that's on the far right with her head falling down?  Yeah.  That's the drunk chick that was stinky.  All right.  So funny.  She's passing out at the table.  She was, like, falling asleep.  She didn't seem too enamored with little Jimmy, either.  I kind of like...  Oh, there she is, Jimmy.  Is that you wearing some kind of sleeveless number?  Yeah, with her eyes closed, and you got your key hanging from your belt?  Oh, she's very cute.  Yeah, that's why I can make sure I get my, you know, car on the way out. 
[00:38:00]  You're very cute.  I'm surprised I didn't write you back.  Thank you, sir.  Yeah, you should have wrote her back, Jimmy.  Well, why don't you give me an email?  I'll apologize.  I won't hit on you.  I promise you.  Jimmy, she kind of dresses like Lindy England, but...  It's a great picture of little Jimmy.  And what's this picture of this guy picking his nose?  That's the guy that was with the stinky chick.  Oh, my God.  He's picking his nose?  He's picking a winner.  That isn't a scratch.  And Jimmy's in the background doing his act, and this guy's just digging deep with his...  He went thumb.  Thumb and forefinger. 
[00:38:30]  How many people go thumb when they're going after their nose?  Only when you got a better nail on the thumb, and you got to scrape the top wall.  No, no, no.  I'm just saying.  Stop it.  I prefer the pointer finger, because you can get it deeper into the canal.  But when you got the thumb sometimes, the nail on the thumb scrapes against the top inside wall.  It's a good way to scrape up all that dry snot.  Yeah.  No!  It's kind of like, you know, in the winter when you have to scrape your windshield.  God.  You want to get all that out of there.  Looks like a nice bloody frosted mini-weed. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah!  God!  Pull out a nice chewy scab.  Stop it!  I was scared to post that, because I knew it would gross Anthony out.  You ever have the dry, wet...  So you have the dry part of the snot where you can hold it, and then the rest is like a bungee cord.  We're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Absolutely.  Use a fucking tissue, you disgusting animals.  God gave me a tissue.  It's called this finger.  All right, Daniel.  You've got to make the tissue into a reamer.  Bye, sweetie. 
[00:39:30]  Get up there and spin it around a few times, and then it winds it up.  No, I never do that.  Like a cotton candy.  Yeah, it just winds it.  That would tickle my nose.  No, you've got to make something.  Like, you make a tissue paper finger.  You kind of mold it, and then you shove that up, because it's more absorbent than your finger.  And anything up there tends to stick to the tissue.  And then when you twist it around, it wraps around and just pulls everything out.  I do make something.  A sandwich.  God damn it!  I absolutely... 
[00:40:00]  I don't know.  I use tissue, but I don't just jam it up and twist it.  All right, let's go to Pete in New York.  Pete, what's up?  You like boogers?  Pete!  Pete?  Pete!  Right, right.  What did I do here?  Let's try this.  Pete!  The boogers are delicious.  So salty.  Just like a salty treat you don't expect.  Hey, Angel Eyes, how are you?  Good, good.  You just made Eric take his headphones off.  Two things.  First, I have a statement, and then a question.  The statement is, I just wanted to thank you guys for the ass baby wipes. 
[00:40:30]  My ass has never been cleaner.  So fantastic.  Oh, another satisfied customer.  Yeah.  Just because of you guys, I went to the store and bought them, and I'm so happy.  See, I wanted to buy those things a long time ago, but I thought they said baby wipes  on them.  No.  I didn't want them just laying in my freaking bathroom.  You don't want to smell like a baby.  No, but you turned us on to the fact that they changed the name.  They got the word baby off them, so you can have these hanging out in your bathroom.  Now they're just wipes. 
[00:41:00]  They're just wipes.  I'm going through my stash really fast.  You got to stock up.  You know what you got to do?  Let me tell you what you must do.  This is a must do.  You have to always, Opie, have another box in your cabinet.  And the second you pull it out, get another one to replace it.  Because if you find you ran out, now that you're using them and have them, if you run  out and don't get to use it, you'll be in hell. 
[00:41:30]  Yes.  You will not feel clean and fresh like you do now.  Very nice.  It's a nice little unmarked box on the toilet, so no one knows.  You pull off the wrap, and it sits there like a little white box.  Now it's just a plain white box, right?  Nothing on it at all, so no one knows what it is.  If they open it up, it looks like little wet naps.  Yeah, clean my hands.  If you push it off, you don't worry about it.  There you go.  But we all know what it contains.  We all know the secret when the door closes.  Let me tell you something.  Kenny was actually the one that turned me on to it first, Club So to Kenny. 
[00:42:00]  Really?  But I thought he was just a kook.  Just a kook.  And then when someone like Anthony tells you the same thing, who you know is a kook, then  you really got to listen and go out to the store and get him.  That's because Kenny has the lower intestines of a goose with Parkinson's.  He can't stop taking dumps.  Well, he eats his steak.  That guy eats steak and potatoes.  That's it.  He's a mess.  Yeah, go ahead.  One question for you.  When are you guys going to go ahead and confirm that Ron and Fez signed with you guys? 
[00:42:30]  All right.  Oh, I remember Ron and Fez.  Yes.  Hey, Fez.  For those guys.  They're really funny.  We got some great Ron and Fez audio.  We should play that today.  We really should.  I feel bad about it because it's kind of like, you know, I know the guy.  I feel bad.  What guy?  Fez.  It's Fez losing his mind.  Why?  Well, it seems it was, I guess, his birthday. 
[00:43:00]  And he was drinking a bit on the air.  And he was very emotional over the past couple of months of the private things that were going  on in his life, personal things.  And he pretty much had a nervous breakdown.  He lost his mind crying hysterically on the air.  Live on the show.  Live on the show.  Because I guess it was his birthday, like you were saying.  So they had him drinking as much as he could.  Yeah, they had him drinking.  And they thought it would be a fun little thing.  And all of a sudden, you know, they hit a soft spot somewhere. 
[00:43:30]  And he just broke down.  Because he had recently lost his grandmother.  And his grandmother was in the hospital for a long time.  And he was visiting, so he was pretty emotional about that whole thing.  And something happened where that came to the surface.  And he just lost his mind.  And Ronnie's just, you know, I know everybody.  I know, pal.  I hear you, pal.  I know, buddy.  That's all he could say.  Because Fez is just, and I went through all this in my life.  And I don't know.  He's just losing his mind. 
[00:44:00]  Wow.  So it's very compelling.  Kind of funny.  And a little sad.  We really like these guys a lot.  There's not many people we like in the business.  But Ron and Fez, we like a lot.  Well, there's no one else.  I can't think of one other person I like.  I like Scott Farrell.  I like Brother Weez, obviously.  I don't know any other people.  I like that Shred guy in Buffalo.  Yeah.  We like Alice and Sarah and No Name in San Francisco.  Oh, yeah, they were cool. 
[00:44:30]  Very cool.  Pugs and Kelly, all right.  Pugs and Kelly, great.  Don Imus.  Imus, I like a lot.  Sean Hannity.  There's a few.  Mad Max.  Who's he?  I don't know.  We listened to him the other day.  Oh, he was nuts.  Oh, that guy?  I don't know.  You know, that bit could have worked.  Yeah.  I'm not giving up on that bit.  I'm not giving up on it.  I'm not giving up on that bit.  The first one was a scream.  I'm not giving up on it.  There's something there.  Mm-hmm.  Maybe we don't go and do the bit for 40 minutes, but every once in a while, if a listener is  listening to something really wacky locally, they could call in and let us listen in. 
[00:45:00]  When a game is going on, one of their fun things, not just them babbling.  Instead of just dedicating an hour of the show and going, okay, let's make radio gold here.  Oh, I like it.  Maybe the listeners have to take it upon themselves, and when they hear some really wacky, awful  local radio, they call in with, oh, you've got to hear this.  You wouldn't do an hour straight of Guess What's in My Pants.  No.  But every so often, when it just pops in, it's fun.  Yeah.  I got you.  So I hope you guys are hearing us out there.  Yeah.  That's where you get to take the bit and run with it. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, but now we're depending on the listener to decide what's entertaining, because now  you're just going to get a bunch of people calling up, yeah, I got this, oh, they're  in commercial, oh, they're doing this, they're not talking.  I just don't want to give up on that bit, though.  There's something there.  So we'll see.  We'll see if the listeners can bring that bit back and make it as big as I think we can make  it.  Okay?  Ron and Fez, so we got some, you want to play this audio?  Yeah, we got a few more minutes here before we have to take a break, Anthony.  Yeah, I'm just sorry.  I was making an instant feedback.  And I thought I was the only one who did the toilet paper twist. 
[00:46:00]  For some reason, my mouth moves in weird ways while I'm twisting sometimes.  I never eat it or anything.  Gross.  I just noticed that this happens.  Yeah.  When you're twisting in your nose, you get some kind of weird thing happening.  Your mouth kind of moves around a little bit.  It's all connected in there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Why is it that I'm a weirdo for wrapping toilet paper around my finger to make myself  like what I'm doing?  Well, because it's not your nostril. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, no.  It's your ass.  No.  No.  Why not just blow your nose?  Oh, I do.  I blow my nose.  But sometimes there's just something hanging on there.  Yeah.  It's very sticky sometimes.  No offense.  I've never heard anyone else doing what you do.  I know.  It's odd.  But I don't think it's...  You violate your ass with your own finger and toilet paper.  For the new listeners, he wraps a bunch of toilet paper around his one finger, his index  finger, and he shoves it up.  Up there.  How far?  Knuckle?  Two knuckles?  You guys make it seem like I'm running and jamming it.  No, I just gently...  No, not just enough to make sure it's clean.  How high?  I don't know. 
[00:47:00]  How deep do you go?  One or two knuckles.  Up to the watch?  How far do you go?  One or two?  One, dude.  Not two.  One.  One?  I think one's even weird, though, man.  One is like...  I'm looking at tattooed girls out there.  One is a little weird.  I think it's a little weird, bro.  It is.  You should just...  It's a little weird.  You know, the surface is fine.  You can get a good, you know, get a good cleanup going, but you don't have to go up in there.  One foot on the seat, one on the floor, bent forward. 
[00:47:30]  Like we were discussing last week, as long as the door's closed, you don't need to know  what's behind that door.  He's got a whole stance and everything.  Yeah.  One foot...  Wait a minute.  I'm like a Heisman Trophy.  I'm just like...  You get up off the toilet.  I stand.  You stand up.  Yeah.  Now you...  Hold on.  You can't stand.  That messes up everything back there.  It mushes them back together.  No.  Can I stand?  It's kind of like the...  Hold on, hold on.  I got a quick thing.  All right.  It reminds me of, you know, painting as a kid. 
[00:48:00]  And you have paint on one side, and then they make you fold the paper.  Oh, like a pink block.  Yeah, and then you open up, it's like, ah, wow, now that paint's over there.  You're doing a Rorschach test between your butt cheeks.  How did you know that was called a Rorschach test?  You don't know that?  No one knows that.  Rorschach didn't know they named it after him until he just heard you say it.  I'm sorry.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  It's funny.  I was talking to Doug online last night, and he wrote something, and he even wrote Slurp 
[00:48:30]  in parentheses.  It really made me laugh.  What I do is I stand up.  Now, do you face the toilet?  You turn and face it and put one foot up on it?  That really depends on what the way...  I mean, you kind of have to kind of face the back a little bit.  Yeah, yeah, okay.  I mean, I don't get backed by the septic tank like I'm Washington on the front of the boat.  Put one foot up and look forward.  Throw a nickel across the bathroom.  He has a toilet stool. 
[00:49:00]  We've discussed that.  We've heard about his toilet stool.  In order to get a good dump, Jimmy has a little footstool that he puts his feet up on.  I think that's to help the cleanup, right?  No, no, no.  No, while his feet are elevated, it's easier for him to die.  It's better for your intestines.  It's a healthier position to be in.  It takes your feet off the floor about six to eight inches, I think.  It just makes your insides bend up a bit.  So he's sitting there like he's in a mercury capsule.  Sometimes I'll put my hand on my chin and the other on my knee, and I look like the thinker. 
[00:49:30]  But I get off the ball.  I put my left foot on the floor, my right foot on the seat.  Oh, my God.  I lean forward.  Lean forward.  I reach back.  Oh, my God.  And the kid gets to work.  You know, that's the same stance, the same pose that's on the tampon boxes for girls to insert the tampon.  There you go.  Yeah.  They put a leg up and then pop it in there.  So you're using that stance, only you bend over.  I'm a trainable.  You are a trainable. 
[00:50:00]  Wow.  And how long have you done this?  My whole life.  Your whole entire life.  Yeah.  From the first time you remember wiping, you've stood up to wipe.  That was the worst part about being in Iraq, was that we were in Baghdad.  We had those weird, the bathrooms, or the toilets, and they don't want you comfortable  on the toilet.  So when you sit down, there's a big piece of, like, you're in a teeny stall by yourself,  and there's a black leather curtain hanging in front of you.  Oh, boy.  This is trouble for you.  And your knees hit the leather curtain, so it'll poke out.  Yeah.  They just want you on and off the bowl.  So what happens is when I stood up to a wipe, I was actually pushing the leather curtain 
[00:50:30]  forward, so I was kind of leaning out.  With your ass?  No, with my head, because I put it on the bowl.  All right.  So I kind of looked like I was looking at people.  It was really creepy.  Oh, that is creepy.  Did you see my little head poking out?  As you're wiping yourself?  Yeah.  As you're screaming with one finger?  Yeah.  All right.  Listen to this guy, man.  Eric Statenhion.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I just want to let you know about my habit.  I'm sure Anthony does the same thing, but if you're in, like, a public bathroom, first 
[00:51:00]  thing you do, you've got to build the nest with the toilet paper around the seat.  Yeah.  And my biggest problem is when you take the shit and it splashes down and you get the  water on your ass, so you put up a splash guard.  You lay down one, maybe four squares of a toilet paper in the water, so when the shit  hits the water, you don't get that water in your ass.  Like a target area.  Exactly.  So it cushions the blow and you don't get the splash back.  Sir, you are a genius.  I have been trying to figure out how to keep public toilet water from hitting you there.  That's all you've got to do is use four squares. 
[00:51:30]  Four squares?  No, dude.  Let me tell you.  I'm going to use a bunch.  Four doesn't seem like enough.  I have an idea, sir.  I'm just going to put a mountain in there so it just cushions the blow.  Why don't you drink more water so your dumps don't fall out like little fiber bricks and  splash into the toilet?  No, sometimes, if it's falling from altitude, you will get that splash back.  You don't need splash back.  Oh, it's classic.  That's brilliant, sir.  All right, Eric.  Thank you.  Take care, guys.  Speaking of which, we did that signing at the Hilton. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, yeah.  Do we have pictures of that?  Did we get the pictures up online?  That stall was a crime scene.  That was so freaking funny.  Anthony and I had to take leaks or whatever.  Actually, I had to take a dump.  No, you had to take a dump, too.  I decided, after all was said and done, we were ready to walk out.  I had some grumbling going on.  So I decided to turn back around and go, I'm going to stay in here a little longer.  A little percolating.  Well, they had this one stall, and it just had a note on it that basically said, you  know, temporarily out of order.  Yeah.  When you see a sign like that, you've got to open up the door to see what's out of order. 
[00:52:30]  What's the problem?  Perhaps someone broke the tank in the back.  Perhaps there's a leaky pipe.  And I'm thinking...  And it looked fine.  And I'm thinking, how bad could this be?  Because the other...  It's the nice, roomy, handicapped stall, so it really has to be out of order for me  not to use it.  Because they had the electronics convention going on, and all the stalls were packed,  the urinal...  I mean, it was a...  It was a...  A whole house.  A whole house.  So I'm thinking, how bad could it be?  So I open up the door, and then I open up the lid and start screaming.  Oh.  It was awful. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  It was really, really bad.  The toilet didn't flush.  No.  And somebody had really had a go at it.  That's what I want to talk about.  It wasn't somebody.  What was it, an animal?  It was a whole bunch of people.  How could one person look in there and then see it full and go?  You've never dumped on someone else's dump because you were desperate?  Never in my life would I ever even consider that.  I said, if you're desperate. 
[00:53:30]  If I'm desperate, no.  Port-a-john?  No.  Well, port-a-john, that's different.  You think this guy's ever used a port-a-john to take a dump?  Dude, I was a construction worker.  Of course I did.  Of course I did.  I forget about your old life.  My old life.  It's all about your new Howard Hughes type life.  I use those, but the portable ones, there's quite a distance between you and the soiled mess  that's below you.  You're not getting a splash pack.  If you're getting a splash pack in a toilet with a log in it, and a log that's been sitting 
[00:54:00]  there a while, God knows what's crawling up there.  There was so much going on in that toilet, there's no splash pack.  I think it was one guy that really had a go at it.  Really had a problem.  But we have pictures of that.  Ricky took him.  We made him take the pictures.  That's hilarious.  It's like a brownie truck ran through the wall of the pudding factory.  Dude, and just made it.  It was a mess.  It was, yeah, but, you know, Punk just did an episode on this over the weekend.  I saw it like three or four times because, God, they just run the shows into the ground 
[00:54:30]  all weekend long over and over and over again.  You're talking about the Opie and Anthony program.  Well.  Oh.  And they did the same thing because they were basically saying when you see something like  this, you want to show your friends.  Yeah.  You have to show your friends.  It's like, oh my God, look at Stallman.  Even you looked.  It is a funny little treat.  Even you looked, Anthony.  Of course I did.  I was very surprised.  And they did something with Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz.  Pretty much accusing, I think, Salma Hayek of leaving a huge duty. 
[00:55:00]  A big dump.  In one of the stalls.  It was a pretty good punk, actually.  Pretty good.  All right.  Where were we?  Oh, the Ron and Fez audio.  Oh, right.  So these guys are good pals of ours.  And yeah, Fez begins to crack.  There's three short clips here.  But basically, Fez starts losing it live on the air.  Loses is fine.  It's like his birthday show and they're getting him drunk.  He's drunk.  And all of a sudden, he's thinking about all the stuff that's wrong in his life, I guess.  He's a very emotional man.  Here we go.  And Mikey, I swear to you, in heaven, you never cut me slack once during this month. 
[00:55:30]  Who's Mikey?  Who's Mikey?  Mike.  Mike, uh, Mike D. He's one of their guys.  Oh.  Mikey D. Remember Mikey D?  Mikey D.  Remember the guy with the curly hair?  All right.  So why is he yelling at Mike?  Why is he crying and yelling at Mike? 
[00:56:00]  We have to set this up for the new listeners.  I'm a little confused, so they've got to be confused.  I guess he's had a tough, tough month.  Yeah, he had a tough month with his grandmother and stuff.  His grandma, what, died or something?  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, you know this story?  A little bit.  All right.  We've got to set it up for the new listeners, because there's a lot of people that just  don't even know who Ron and Fez are, and we've got to give them a nice push here.  Basically, Mikey D. was a little upset that Fez did not acknowledge his birthday.  So he calls to say, oh, you know, you guys forgot my birthday.  Meanwhile, Fez is having a tough time. 
[00:56:30]  He's had problems with his family and stuff, so he's very stressed out.  Oh, wasn't Fez's birthday?  Well, it was Fez's birthday, and Mikey D. called Fez up to wish him a happy birthday,  but then threw in the fact that Fez didn't wish him a happy birthday, which happened a  couple of weeks prior.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Let's go back to the tape.  And Mikey, I swear to you in heaven, you never cut me slack once during this month.  That has probably been the worst month of my life. 
[00:57:00]  You never cut me slack once.  Okay, Fez.  Why don't we do this?  Because a lot of this, I know you've had a lot of stress.  And this has been the worst month of my life.  I know, buddy.  And somehow, through some irony of God, through some joke that he finds funny, that the Supreme  Bean finds funny, my birthday ends up at the end of this month that I have had the most 
[00:57:30]  brutal time of, I'm supposed to sit here and drink, you know, and drink, and have a great  time, and, you know, act like nothing's happened whatsoever.  I know, buddy.  Here's what I have been brutalized through this month, and you never, ever got me one ounce 
[00:58:00]  of slack.  Not once did you ever say, hey, I'm here for you.  It was always, hey, I'm here for me.  Okay.  Um, also, Fezzy.  And this was, go ahead, Ronnie.  I just want you to know that, no matter what, a lot of this is because you're drinking and  you have had a hard month.  And I just want you to...  It's been the most brutal month of my life.  I know it has, buddy.  And no one knows what I've been through. 
[00:58:30]  I know, pal.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  Oh, wow, man.  Don't you do it!  Don't!  You!  I got nowhere else to go!  I got nowhere else to go!  Trying and yelling at Mike, you sure that wasn't done?  I backed over the little fella.  This is the worst month of my life. 
[00:59:00]  Little Rudy was in the driveway.  Wow.  That is one emotional man.  Yeah.  He had lost his mind.  Yeah, he's just having a breakdown live on the show.  And Ronnie's just...  Yeah, I know.  All right, let's do this.  We got two more short clips.  It continues.  It's been absolutely insane.  I had to sit there and watch and get a call every day. 
[00:59:30]  That my grandmother was passing away.  Mm-hmm.  And you know what, Sandy?  She held...  No, you let me talk.  I'm sorry.  Please.  I'm sorry.  She held on through every day this month.  And I had to deal with it every day. 
[01:00:00]  How long was it?  Every day.  I got a call saying this was the last day.  Ronnie, you know that.  I know that, man.  Oh, my God.  This is really tough to listen to.  A family member dies and you insult me.  What the hell is the matter with you anyway?  Okay.  Terrific.  Wow.  We have one more clip, Anthony. 
[01:00:30]  Wow.  Very uncomfortable radio to listen to.  Fez, you're on Ron and Fez.  Hey, Fez.  Our pals Ron and Fez.  I love them.  Just so everyone knows, I'm the first one in my family to move away.  Right.  Everyone else in my family is there in Pinellas Park, Florida.  Everyone else was there with my grandmother when it was time to happen. 
[01:01:00]  My father retired tonight after all his years of work.  And I couldn't be there.  And I couldn't be there.  You know?  Right.  And it's not easy to be the one that's not there.  And for someone else to come along and just accuse me of forgetting, forgetting his birthday, 
[01:01:30]  of someone else to accuse me of, like, being selfish with my feelings,  it's absolutely more than I can take.  Because there's nothing more in the world.  When I had to, my grandmother got married on Monday.  I stayed there.  I flew back to Washington, D.C. on Tuesday. 
[01:02:00]  You know, here's the thing.  My grandmother, almost 90 years old.  That's cool.  I said goodbye to her.  You know, I say, you know, we settled things.  But I had to leave my family.  I know.  When they were at their absolute weakest, they had already lost someone.  And then I had to look them in the eye and say, well, I'm off to D.C. 
[01:02:30]  Okay.  Right.  Well.  All of that is on my conscience.  I know, buddy.  And for someone to, you know, for someone to make me feel guilty about what's going on on my birthday,  when, trust me, is this the place I want to be?  Is this the place I should be?  Probably not.  It's just disgusting. 
[01:03:00]  It's just disgusting.  Stop whining.  Stop it.  Stop whining.  You had a tough day, Anthony.  Wow.  Wow, man.  Fez sounds upset.  That is unbelievably emotional. 
[01:03:30]  Mike was probably just busting balls.  Hey, you forgot my birthday.  Yeah, I know.  Just being silly.  I think Fez was, you know, pretty drunk, too.  Yeah, of course.  Really.  You know.  He was hammered.  I've heard the guy is a professional.  You know, many years spent on the air.  I couldn't see him just, you know, doing this unless he had been really liquored up.  From what I remember, didn't take much for old Fezzy to get drunk, either.  You know, a couple of drinks.  He's pretty much pretty hammered.  Well, one of these days we'll get to the bottom of the whole story. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  I'm sure.  And then I guess we got audio of Ron, like, losing it because, I guess, you know, Fezzy  wasn't around because he had to go to the funeral and things like that.  He was flying back and forth.  No, actually, he was in studio.  He was just being very quiet.  Oh, okay.  For some odd reason that day.  All right.  So, Fezzy was being quiet because he went through all this, you know, personal shit.  Which happened first?  This, Ron or Fez, do you know?  I think the Fez clip was first.  Yeah.  And then, you know, then Fezzy's quiet maybe a day later, a couple days later, whatever.  And the PD comments that Fezzy's being quiet. 
[01:04:30]  Is he there?  Calling in the show.  Yeah, he's calling it in.  He's not pulling his weight.  Stuff like that.  Jesus.  Right.  Yeah.  These program directors, they're just the worst.  Just the bunch of scumbags.  Useless.  Useless pieces of meat.  All you programmers out there, you're just failed radio hosts.  So, you couldn't do it yourself.  So, now you're going to, you know, get a whip and tell everyone else how it's done?  Yeah.  Please.  So, the clip is a little, the audio isn't the best, but Ronnie just loses it and sticks 
[01:05:00]  up for his friend Fezzy here.  What's up, dude?  All good.  What's happening?  Who has it?  This camera.  What's he want?  You want to know if Fez is on the show tonight?  Hey, we want to know if we have an effing program director.  Because we've never seen you this entire year.  What an ass.  So, the program director has to pipe in and ask if Fezzy's on the show tonight.  Yeah.  Because he's not talking much.  Right.  So, Ronnie finally just has it. 
[01:05:30]  Or, had it, I mean.  What's up, Ben?  You know a little bit about this?  No.  Oh, you're just, uh, okay.  All right.  It happens.  So, as far as we're concerned, we've never had a program director here.  So, why don't you check on that?  Because when I talked to New York and I brought your name up, they said he's just the secretary.  The program director we have here is the guy who watches the paint dry.  Ringing a show in the middle of it.  Like you know radio.  Like you've ever worked in radio other than watching G. Gordon Liddy read a paper for three hours a day. 
[01:06:00]  Jesus.  You wonder why.  So, Fez, what do you want to talk about?  I guess you've been dogging it tonight?  You're laid back?  I guess so.  I apologize then.  Sorry about that.  Why didn't you call in when his grandmother died and he's flying back and forth doing shows here?  He doesn't get a call then.  He never got a call to say thank you from him.  That was from no one.  Maybe there's some more O'Reilly emails that have to be answered.  Unbelievable. 
[01:06:30]  Unbelievable.  Turn your radio off.  Just turn it off.  You're not the program director here.  You've never been one.  And stop calling Brian at 9 o'clock in the morning.  He works nights.  And every morning he goes, guess what time I got a call today?  The guy works nights.  He doesn't get out of here until 12 o'clock.  He's up for a couple hours.  Call him after noon.  You've got nothing to say other than do the AOL plug. 
[01:07:00]  That's the secretary's job, by the way.  It's not a program director.  Just like when I said, have someone train Brian.  No one did.  Why?  Because no one here knows how to do it.  You don't know how to do it.  Or do you want more out of Fez?  You want him to sit around and talk about how difficult it's been for him the last month or so.  No, forget that.  How difficult it's been for him the last two years.  But he keeps giving to this place. 
[01:07:30]  How difficult it's been for him for two effing years.  Call him there and ask him there.  Or apologize to this man.  But don't ever call here and ask if he's dogging it.  Because nobody gives more than Fez Watley.  Anywhere I've ever worked, nobody gives more than Fez Watley.  Call here again and I'll rip that damn phone out of the wall.  I'm not playing games with you.  I'm not effing playing games.  I'll chase you down the damn street with him. 
[01:08:00]  Don't make me sit here and tell what we really want to do, Cameron.  Because my agent tells me to stay cool until he gets here.  That's all you've got going for you right now.  Because if you want to see your mom's box show, I'll do it tonight, bitch.  I'll do it tonight.  And I'll say exactly what takes place in these effing halls.  Bravo, bravo.  Ronnie.  Nice.  Nice. 
[01:08:30]  I've got to say, it's not good policy to talk to your boss like that.  Ron better straighten up and fly right.  Don't talk to your program director like that.  Just like us, he doesn't have a boss.  Stop.  They throw these guys at you and you've got to make believe they're your bosses.  That's what it comes down to.  Like, oh, you're my boss.  Wink, wink.  And you reach a point in your career where you actually know that you don't have the boss  and he knows it and you just do what you do.  Exactly.  Wow. 
[01:09:00]  That show is very emotional.  Well, they're still working for our old company, you know.  Yeah, see?  See what it's like to work for a regular radio station.  See the difference?  I mean, believe it or not, overall, we're all happy in this room, you know.  We have our moments, but, you know, they're just miserable.  And they want out.  And they will get out.  And then we'll see what happens from there.  I hear they're asking for clips of U2 last week.  No one breathes down our neck here at all. 
[01:09:30]  Nobody.  No.  No, there's no, like, hey, you've got to talk about this.  Because they know better.  Yeah, our major gripe had been in the past that not enough people were involved with the show.  And that we needed more assistance with things like equipment and promotions and stuff like that.  But, yeah, we've had nothing as far as people breathing down our neck saying we have to do this, that, or the other thing.  We come in here, we stroll in on a daily basis, do our show.  Yeah.  Leave.  Do we have time to do one more thing?  What we got?  Well, I mean, we're playing audio from other radio shows. 
[01:10:00]  I've got some audio of Brother Weezer's show I want to share with people.  All right.  This is pretty intense stuff, though.  And then we'll move on to other things.  We've got Andy Gore outside the studio.  He's going to take back the pickled punk.  Thank God.  Thank God is right.  And he's got two fine young ladies with him.  Lovely gals.  What the hell is that?  I don't know.  It was once alive.  That's a new one?  It's a bigger one.  Oh, my God.  He's brought some stuff for us to check out.  It's a pickled teenager.  I don't know what's going on here. 
[01:10:30]  Anthony gets queasy with this stuff, but, no, I mean with the Brother Weez thing and stuff.  I know you support him, but my mentor in the business, he's fighting cancer.  Some rare nasal fucking cancer that he probably got when he was doing his tours in Vietnam.  Because it's the type of cancer they find in, like, pretty much Asian countries.  That's about it.  Asian orange, I think.  Yeah, but he has it way, way back in his nasal passages, and they couldn't operate, 
[01:11:00]  so they had a blast radiation on the guy's face, 33 treatments, 33 treatments right to the face.  And they had a, you know, like Jimmy with the girl in Boston, gave her 33 treatments to the face.  That urine could do a job on freaking tumors if he could get to it.  And so, basically, he left his family, you know, in Rochester, two young kids, and he's got two older kids.  And him and his wife came down here to get the treatment at Sloan Kettering. 
[01:11:30]  I was, you know, visiting him pretty much every other day, man, you know, doing the show and just going there and showing my support for him.  Because the guy has done nothing but great stuff for my career over the years.  And they had this, like, mass that they had to, like, you know, pin him down so he doesn't move.  And they had tattoos all over his face so the radiation knows which areas to hit.  And I watched the guy slowly but surely just deteriorate day after day.  You know, the first few times I visited him, it's like, oh, wow, this is a piece of cake.  Look, you had three radiation treatments. 
[01:12:00]  Look how good you're doing.  But then a week goes by and you see him dropping down, dropping down, losing the weight, brutal sunburn all over his face and his neck.  Anyway, he was really, really struggling because he got to a point, you know, he couldn't really swallow anymore and all sorts of, like, dry sores on his tongue.  Just brutal stuff happening to the guy.  Brutal.  Ugh.  Absolutely.  You can't drink water or something?  There's nothing they can do?  Well, he chose not to get a feeding tube, which I guess really helps you out because he's like, screw that. 
[01:12:30]  You know, I want to try to, you know, live, whatever, blah, blah, blah.  So, you know, he was still trying to eat.  Everything was blended down.  And just to get water in him or any kind of, you know, nourishment was just like, you know, swallowing razor blades is how he describes it because everything is just beyond dry.  So, I don't know.  The weird thing is he was still doing his radio show as much as he could.  At first he was doing all four hours.  Then he was doing, you know, what he calls a set.  Like he was doing, you know, a 40-minute set and that was it for the day.  Just an update because in Rochester he's a rock star. 
[01:13:00]  I mean, the whole freaking city has gotten behind the guy.  And so, I got two clips really fast.  They're really short.  You know, I guess they were talking about, he was talking about how hard, you know, the whole treatment has been.  And some people are saying, why don't you just quit, man, you know?  Why don't you just quit and, you know, try another way because obviously this is not working, blah, blah, blah.  And his young son, who's only like five or six years old, calls into the show.  So, listen to this.  Oh, boy.  You can take a break, man.  Jesus.  This is real life stuff. 
[01:13:30]  And then we'll get back to the funny.  Please, before we take a break, there's a special call for you.  This is a very, very special call.  Seriously.  Here we go.  Sammy.  Your son Sammy wants to talk to Daddy.  Sammy.  I love you, Daddy.  Sammy.  You're going to make Mommy cry, Sammy.  I'm going to start crying.  Sammy, are you?  No.  I love you, honey.  I love you, too, Daddy.  We'll be home soon, honey.  Bye.  Be a good boy at school today.  There is no school.  Don't go to school today. 
[01:14:00]  We're going to go egg Mary Flood's house.  Uncle Tommy's going to take you over with a whole fistful of eggs.  Get it, Sammy.  Love you, Sammy.  Do it, Daddy.  What, honey?  You can do it, Daddy.  Thank you, honey.  I can do it.  Bye, honey.  You got to do it now, Weezy.  Hey, now there's inspiration.  Oh, boy.  There you got to go.  Come on.  There's inspiration.  That was cute.  See, the setup on that is, you know, he was basically, you know, telling everyone how tough 
[01:14:30]  it is, and some lady, this Mary Flood or something, called him and said, why don't you just quit  and try, like, the natural approach, whatever, the freaking, the holistic medicine.  Yeah, holistic medicine or something.  Voodoo.  You know, I'm basically saying, this isn't for you.  Why don't you try something different?  And so, you know, the son calls to say, you know, don't quit, Daddy.  Pat from Monaki saying, Bob Kelly is inconsolable right now.  Yeah, the last half hour of the show.  That's really funny, actually. 
[01:15:00]  Just sitting there blubbering with a blubbering.  So, I got another clip.  It's fast.  This Mary Flood calling in the program, basically, to tell Weezy to quit and try the holistic  approach, and Weezy's feisty wife gets involved, and they go at it here.  It's pretty good.  Pretty interesting radio.  Hey, Mary Flood's on the phone.  Oh, no.  No, no, no.  All right.  Put her on.  All right, but if she said, I'm not.  She just wants to talk to Doreen.  I'm asked.  Mary?  Mary?  Doreen's mad at you, honey.  Yeah, Mary, I'm not happy right now with the email from the other day. 
[01:15:30]  From last night?  Yeah.  I told you not to do that.  I don't want someone trying to encourage him to quit.  Yeah, this bitch just trying to, you know, get him to quit.  She wants him to quit his chemo or his radiation?  His radiation.  And try the holistic thing.  Yeah, well, holistic is nice if you have, like, you know, a sore throat, but when you're  going for cancer, you've got to skip the holistic and go to Western medicine.  Pretty much go with what's been proven to work the best.  Kind of doubled the life expectancy in Western medicine in the last couple hundred years. 
[01:16:00]  Who was the actor that decided to get this?  Michael Landon.  Michael Landon went with it.  Decided to get the coffee enemas.  Yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  Instead of getting, you know, the real treatment.  And then there was another actor.  Andy Kaufman tried it, but I mean, that was after everything else failed.  Right.  Yeah.  Well, he went to that, the kook.  In the Philippines, I think, right?  In the Philippines or whatever.  Where they were taking out, remember, they were taking out fake tumors?  Yeah.  That old guy?  Yeah, I noticed it.  All right.  My only suggestion is, Weez always says that, go with your gut feeling. 
[01:16:30]  Mary, are you willing to risk my husband's life?  I'll freaking, I'll come after you.  Are you kidding me?  No, I'm absolutely not.  No, seriously, Mary, I'm serious now.  I asked you this on the phone one day to not do this, and then you sent him an email.  And it took all my strength not to call you last night.  I love you, and you're a great person.  And I think you, in your heart, you think you mean well.  It does mean well.  If you think, try and encourage my husband to stop radiation treatment, I'm not willing  to risk his life.  Maybe you are, but I'm not. 
[01:17:00]  But what happens, hey, Doreen, what happens if I pull that guy?  Oh, my God, I can't even believe this is happening.  What happened to a guy?  I'm going to lose my mind.  I'm not a sane person, so really, somebody better do something.  She finally admitted it, Tommy.  She did it on the radio.  My heart is beating like crazy right now.  Doreen.  All right, Weez, I'll go.  Mary, really, I'm serious.  I'm out of my mind.  You sound like a nutter.  I am.  Call the 911.  Great.  What?  Where are you?  I'm over here.  Where's her? 
[01:17:30]  Come over here.  Where the hell are you?  She's behind the couch.  You can't even see her.  Where are you?  I'm over here.  Over here.  Margo.  Behind you.  You're behind me?  Get over here.  Shut up behind you.  You guys.  Get over here.  Come on.  Everything's all right, Doreen.  He's not going to quit.  No, you don't understand.  It's not easy.  I know we don't.  I mean.  We don't.  We don't understand.  It doesn't sound easy.  Meanwhile, Doreen ain't eating.  By the way, she's got to start eating.  It's so ridiculous.  There's great food everywhere. 
[01:18:00]  I know.  She thinks it's going to bother me.  I go, hey, bother me.  Eat.  Yeah.  Matter of fact, I'm going to get a kick out of you.  She's going to eat something.  It's part of the taking care of wheeze.  You've got to take care of yourself.  Mm-hmm.  Jesus.  You don't eat nothing.  I know.  She's down to nothing.  I eat.  What do you eat?  Come on.  Thong's probably begging you.  Ice cream.  Get some ice cream last night.  What happened?  She sounds like the Michael Jackson character in the tapes when she started crying.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  You're animal.  It's true, though.  All of a sudden, I heard the, I'm sorry, Doreen. 
[01:18:30]  I, I, I'm sorry.  So there you have a little taste, but he, you know, he's been doing his radio show through  the whole damn thing, you know?  How awful is Mary?  Just what a nudge, calling up and minding everybody else's beeswines.  Not even, not even calling.  What happened was she got Wheeze's personal email and started sending him email about,  you know, maybe you should just quit and go holistic and this and that, because he's  been open about his treatment and, and just, you know, telling everyone how awful it is,  you know?  So this person not knowing anything really, in my opinion, is like, oh, you, obviously 
[01:19:00]  you should just quit, you know?  And that's, when you're trying to support someone with cancer, that's the worst thing  you could do.  You could do a holistic in addition, or maybe when you're done, you don't, you don't replace  it.  He was doing some acupuncture and some yoga and all sorts of things, you know, but, but  there you have it.  Just a little taste.  But, you know, I helped, I helped Wheeze move Saturday, so he, he finishes radiation  treatments, 33 of them to the face, blast, looking pretty bad on Saturday, but we packed 
[01:19:30]  him in an RV and he, he got back to Rochester to his house and his family and stuff.  And, and now I guess it's going to be, the treatment's going to be bad for another two  weeks because it's, it continues to cook inside you, all the radiation.  You don't just get your last blast of radiation and then that's it, you start getting hopefully  better.  It still has to cook in there for another two weeks.  So he's got another two weeks where it's going to get worse even, which I can't even  imagine.  And then at that point, hopefully if everything goes all right, he'll get better slowly but 
[01:20:00]  surely every day.  So I've gotten a lot of email on this.  So there's your update.  You know, his, his treatments in New York City are done and we're, we're hoping for the  best.  He's going to get an MRI in like, I guess, June to see what's going on in, in there as far  as the tumor goes, just brutal though.  But man, I mean, the guy, I'm not going to complain that much.  You're not going to see me complaining about stupid shit.  Cause I saw a lot of crazy things in the last two months while he was in town.  So we wish him the best.  There's a, there's a link on opianthony.com. 
[01:20:30]  Yes.  Yeah.  So I was just going to point out, if you go to opianthony.com, the banner right on the  top is a helping brother.  We's kick cancer's ass.  Please make a donation.  Yeah.  It just says kick cancer's ass is a charity.  So he's trying to raise money on top of it for other people.  But there you go.  The sadness of the show is over.  Jesus.  We'll get back to the laughs.  Thrice from opianthony.net saying, Christ, the Hindenburg broadcast had less heartache  than the past hour of radio.  It's real life stuff. 
[01:21:00]  A little variety every once in a while.  It doesn't hurt it.  Oh, the drama.  Bob Kelly on whackbag.com saying, can someone please bring me some tissues?  I don't like Pat Fumunaki being funny all of a sudden.  Yeah.  His last few instant feedbacks have been very good.  It's starting to bug me.  Pat was pretty funny, too.  We were, as I was watching the Rosie O'Donnell retard movie last night, I was on whackbag because  they had a whole thread going about the movie, comments, and Pat had a couple of really good  funny lines.  Wait, they were commenting as the movie was going? 
[01:21:30]  Oh, yeah.  As the movie was going, we were all commenting and laughing about it.  See, I think that's great.  It's hysterical.  There were some really funny bastards on there last night.  Very, very cool.  So, I guess that was the update I wanted to give everyone.  Kick cancer's ass.  The link's on opianathony.com if you want to do something.  If not, that's cool, too.  Whatever.  Just wanted to share that with you.  The guy's, I'm telling you, he's an amazing guy.  All right.  I only met him once and we argued politics.  But you loved him, right?  I liked him very much.  Yeah, he was great.  Well, he's the polar opposite of you two.  He's very liberal, but he's not an annoying liberal. 
[01:22:00]  He's like a Vietnam vet liberal.  He's not like some bleeding heart college dude.  You can't argue with a guy who did two tours of duty.  But what am I going to say?  I'm from the suburbs, fella.  You grew up in the mean streets.  Yeah.  My dad knows people.  I have no arguments to make.  He actually, you know, when the vets call his show and want to, like, talk about it, he's  just like, ugh.  And he openly admits that he went there and had a really good time in general.  And actually signed up for another tour because he was having so much fun. 
[01:22:30]  There was some great Vietnam stuff on, I guess it was the anniversary of the fall of Saigon,  so there was some great Vietnam stuff on the War Channel over the weekend.  Just, you know, rock and roll and killing gooks.  That's how they presented in these specials that they put on there.  Just helicopters whipping in, firing rockets, blowing people up.  Jimi Hendrix playing.  Hendrix playing.  That's what it is.  It's just like rock music playing.  They had a whole show on Just Chopper Pilots and then on Infantry and on the Tet Offensive. 
[01:23:00]  Like, all that stuff.  Just got to love sitting there for a weekend when those marathons are on watching all that stuff.  Great.  Yeah, man!  We were out there in country just kicking ass!  That's what it was.  Firing off their guns.  Killing them gook.  Yeah!  They showed some brutal footage of the Tet Offensive when the Viet Cong came into the American Embassy down there in Saigon. 
[01:23:30]  Oh!  Just some guy.  They had him by this fountain.  And he's just some dead Viet Cong.  He's not even dead.  He was half dead.  And he's taking that last, like, death rattle breath and kind of tensing up.  And they just had the camera on him.  Like, they didn't care back then.  Nowadays, you don't see crap from Iraq.  You really don't.  You don't see anything.  They have a total blackout.  But back then, they showed footage, man, that was just brutal. 
[01:24:00]  Bodies blown in half.  Then they show it.  And the news guy's standing right there.  Bullets flying around.  News guys are right there.  They had balls back then.  Now you don't see any of that shit.  That sexy, naked kid running away.  Oh, running away.  That little whore.  Down the street.  Jesus.  That's my favorite photo from the Vietnam era.  Oh, that napalmed cocktease.  Are you insane?  You guys are nuts. 
[01:24:30]  Have you ever seen The Wall down in Washington?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  I know.  You know, all those names.  Brings it right home.  All right.  We should take our first break.  We got lots of shows still to do.  We still haven't talked about the Rosie O'Donnell movie.  Oh, what a special movie.  I believe, I'm not sure, but I believe it was presented by Hallmark.  Ugh.  Every frigging commercial break, at least two dramas. 
[01:25:00]  There weren't even commercials.  There were like small little dramas going on.  And all wrapped up with somebody getting a birthday card or something.  Aw.  Yeah.  You know what the best part of the movie was yesterday?  What?  Oh, man.  We're going to get into another.  We'll try not to get into another bit.  A little tease, though.  You know, in between the stupid movie, they're doing the news teases.  Yep.  And you're watching the movie.  You'll see how riding the bus is helping developmentally disabled people in our area.  That inspiring story at 11. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  Yes, you heard right.  That inspiring story at 11.  The local news, always in a search of something to fill a few minutes, decides they're going  to do the local angle here on the movie.  Whenever there was...  I remember once they showed Independence Day, and the news teaser broke in, and it's like,  could...  And I'm not kidding.  Could this happen?  Could this happen in New York City?  What?  It's...  It's flying saucers. 
[01:26:00]  If it did, do you think I'd be tuning in to watch your news?  Well, the...  They try to make the local angle on every movie that they're playing that night.  I was going to say, the recent one was the tsunami.  Yeah.  Could a tsunami hit New York City?  Tsunami.  With the news stories, they try to do the local angle, like the tsunami, but the worst  is when they take a movie, and during the movie, they play the teaser for the news, and  they've got to tie the movie.  They figure, if you're interested in the movie, and you're watching it, we've got to link it  up to the news, so then you're going to watch the news, because you're interested in the 
[01:26:30]  movie.  Superheroes in the tri-state area?  Yeah.  We'll show...  Yeah, they're playing Superman.  We'll show you another Superman here in New York.  Oh, okay.  I get it.  Superman.  What?  Oh, God.  And you're watching the movie.  You'll see how riding the bus is helping developmentally disabled people in our area.  That inspiring story at 11.  Inspiring.  Inspiring.  Why don't you sit next to one of them on the bus and see how inspired you are?  You know what they should show helping developmentally disabled people? 
[01:27:00]  They should show the morning after pill and how it's helping prevent this irritation.  R-U-486.  We'll do a report on it.  How did you know the exact name of that pill?  Oh, sorry.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  You're starting to get it, aren't you?  Dude, I was proud of myself that I fired out morning after pill.  I always keep a bottle next to the bed.  I never know.  Open up, honey. 
[01:27:30]  Put it in ice cream.  There you go.  They don't even know they're taking it.  Give it to her and her Flintstones chewables.  Oh, that is genius.  To mix it up with something.  Give it to someone.  It's a great idea.  I never thought of that.  You never know.  Then we got clips from the actual story.  We got clips from the actual story.  Yeah.  I'm a catalog assistant.  I stamp books. 
[01:28:00]  What?  The catalog assistant?  Does what?  He stamps books.  Is that what the inspiring retard does?  Yeah.  Well, and here's another one.  I get the bus on Broadway in Tarrytown, and it ends on Spring Street, and then it turns  to the 19.  This guy just sounds like an annoying ass.  Yeah.  Doesn't sound like a retard.  Not like the rosy retard last night.  Hmm.  Hmm.  All right.  God, the local angle.  It really is awful.  Oh, they just... 
[01:28:30]  What producer comes up to you and says, yeah, could you utter this drivel during the movie?  Ben's in a panic.  Are you in a panic?  Sweetie, what's the matter?  One gem in.  No, I'm just wondering.  Do you need to take a leak?  Yeah, I guess.  That's been a phone for a while.  That's all.  We want to know how that story helped you.  I'm not in a panic.  I wasn't sure.  Well, one day we're just going to do a show four hours straight.  We don't have 18 minutes of commercials, so...  Oh, did you see that article in the paper?  Yeah.  There's an article in the paper about commercial time on some of your favorite shows. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, and the leader's like 23 minutes an hour.  Curtis and Kuby, 22 minutes and five seconds.  Per hour of commercials on that dumb show.  Because what commercial radio is trying to do, these stupid idiots, they have no clue  how to compete with satellite radio.  They're trying to claim that they're doing less commercials.  It's a third of your show.  Right, they're saying we're doing less commercials now.  They did a whole campaign on this, especially, I guess, Clear Channel was the leader on that.  Less is more. 
[01:29:30]  All the other radio groups jumped on board, like, hey, this is a good thing.  We're showing that we're going to try to, you know, knock down the commercial load.  So, John Minnelli of The Post, we love this guy.  He's like, oh, really?  So, they just did a little thing here in New York, and they listen to all these radio stations,  and they're finding out, pfft, they're not playing less commercials.  More than ever.  22 minutes an hour of commercials is, that is just brutal.  It stinks.  And then you have to add the promos on and all that stuff.  Yep.  You know?  Unbelievable. 
[01:30:00]  Just to give you an idea.  I didn't get away with that much.  Just to give you an idea, we just talked an hour and a half.  That would be 33 minutes of commercials.  More than that.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  33 minutes of commercials we could have taken if we were on regular radio.  So, for all you guys that think that the last hour and a half was good,  but maybe 20 minutes of it sucked, that could have been commercials.  Jack off.  Curtis and Kubi.  Mobsters with the lobsters.  I like when Curtis rhymes.  Oh, yuck.  Shut up, shithead. 
[01:30:30]  Shut up.  All right, why don't we take a break?  Do you know on Curtis and Kubi, though, by the way, that one is left and one was right,  and that always makes for an interesting show.  Isn't that great?  Because they could always battle each other's point of views on stuff.  Seesaw!  Always interesting.  Always compelling.  Yuck.  I just hate that the guy on the left is always a dork, though.  Always.  Always.  What's up with that?  The shoe fits.  Alan Combs?  I don't know.  I've never heard of him.  Hannity just bitch slaps him every night.  Every single night. 
[01:31:00]  Has there ever been a cool, hip, kind of liberal talk show host?  You would think they could find just one just to make it interesting viewing.  You know, but Hannity just has his way with Combs.  Hannity's got the heat.  Oh, my God.  Hannity and Combs.  That's the one thing that was really funny.  I forgot what book it was in.  I read a lot of these dumb books on our time off.  The Al Franken book.  I went with the Michael Moore, the Bill Maher, whatever.  Which one was it where, when they were talking about Hannity and Combs, they had Hannity's 
[01:31:30]  name really big?  And then Combs was so small.  It was Al Franken.  It was like the, was it?  Yeah.  The type set they used was the smallest you could possibly use in a book.  And Hannity's his real big?  Yeah, just to show how useless Combs is on that show.  Yes there, Eric.  If you see the promos that they run for the Fox News lineup at night, they go from Bill  O'Reilly to Hannity and Combs.  It's just close-ups of Hannity.  And at one point you didn't see Combs, but now they put him back in.  It's just a quick, like, one second. 
[01:32:00]  There's Combs, and then it goes right into Greta Van Susteren.  There's the kook.  I don't see any kook.  I just see a moving blanket.  Yeah, she put a blanket over her head.  Couldn't they find a better blanket?  Oh, my God.  My grandma knitted this for me, and I brought it to work because I didn't want to use it at home.  My grandma knitted this quilt for me.  Come on, stop.  I love that.  I'd say the closest thing to a hip liberal guy who I think is great is Jon Stewart.  It's the closest thing to being a funny liberal guy. 
[01:32:30]  All right, there you go.  There's an answer to my question.  Yeah, there's one that has a personality and at least a...  And he doesn't come off like a whiny Jew.  He's not self-roll.  I'm sorry.  Jesus.  Dude, that Ben Stein, speaking of whiny Jews.  Oh, my God.  I mean, stop putting this guy on TV.  What is he ragging about now?  I don't know.  You have no idea.  I don't know.  Just he's whining somewhere.  Yeah, he just can't get past the whining part.  I don't know.  He's the worst.  All right, him and his sneakers. 
[01:33:00]  All right, we get it.  You're loose as a goose.  I hate...  You're a casual, comfy guy.  We get it.  I just love that his son turned into a game, a video game addict.  I mean, how to put him in rehab.  Like, of all the embarrassing things your kids could do, drugs, alcohol, sex addiction.  Sucking dick under a porch.  Yeah, anything.  You know, you run through your mind as your kid's growing up and what you might have to go through when he gets older and the drug thing pops up and, you know, the embarrassment of rehab that you'd have to send him to. 
[01:33:30]  And he wound up being addicted to the game EverQuest that he had to take him to a rehab, that Ben Stein's son had to go to a rehab, and that Ben Stein would wake up in the middle of the night because he heard sounds in his house, go downstairs and see his son in the dark in front of a glowing computer monitor playing this game.  And they cried together over it. 
[01:34:00]  It's just a game.  They cried?  You're a faggot.  I know.  I know.  Come on, son.  Let's cry together.  I'm not buying the video game addiction thing.  No?  Nah.  It's just being selfish is all it is.  It's, you know, spending all your time playing games instead of doing other things.  It's not.  Don't call it an addiction.  I'm not buying it.  Some people just say this is more exciting than their regular life.  That's it.  It's being selfish and self-centered, and I enjoy this, so I'm going to do it. 
[01:34:30]  Have you ever walked around New York City on the weekend trying to find something cool to do?  Sometimes.  You know what?  It's just better to boot up your favorite game and spend six to eight hours a day.  Play a game.  That's it.  I mean, in New York City, there's nothing to do unless you want to be a raging alcoholic.  Mm-hmm.  Because you can drink, you know, a million places.  Or eat.  Drink and eat.  That's what you do on the weekends in New York City.  Or take a walk in the park.  Yeah.  Or do a little of that exercising.  Yeah.  Or how about helping some people?  You could do that, too.  Volunteer work. 
[01:35:00]  I do a little bit of that.  Shut up.  Shut up, Jimmy.  Where do you volunteer?  Help people.  I'm off the poker, by the way.  Why?  Eh, got bored with it.  Really?  Yeah.  Uh-oh, you had a big loss, huh?  I got...  You had a big loss.  I got 15 cents left in my account.  Whoa, you went all in on something?  No, I just had a string of the worst luck over the weekend.  I had...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  The last we talked, you were up $1,400, $1,500?  I had $1,400 in my account.  In your account, and you started with two... 
[01:35:30]  I started with $250.  Okay, all right.  So you were up over $1,000.  $1,400.  I went down to $1,000 a few times.  Got down to like $700.  Brought it back up.  Then over the weekend, I can't tell you how many times I came in fourth place.  And fourth is just out of the money.  Yeah, I know.  Come in third, you make some money.  Fourth, nothing.  It was happening time and time and time again.  I could not win.  And that's what happened.  So I wound up...  I think I had at like $50.15 left, something like that, $51. 
[01:36:00]  I went in for a $50 thing.  Instead of doing $10 and having five chances, I figured I'd do the $50.  Because I'll win $250.  Fourth place again.  Lost.  Nothing.  You still don't think that's computer-generated, some of that stuff?  I still think if there's six characters...  I'm so suspicious.  ...tooled for a computer-generated, and the computer knows what everybody needs, so it  makes one of the ones that's tied in with the computer win.  I mean, I guarantee that's garbage.  There's no way.  And what, are you chatting with a computer thing? 
[01:36:30]  No, there's somebody there...  No, no, no.  But there's somebody there working that, but the computer has everything worked out.  They know who's going to get what card.  It's a computer.  It's not a real gentleman.  I like Jimmy's angle on this, because I'm very suspicious.  I was trying to think cheat codes, but now I like his.  What would be the upside for a company to do that when they're making money hand over  fist just for the fact...  Yeah, they are making a lot of money.  Good point.  It doesn't matter if you win or lose.  If you're winning or losing, if everyone at the table is winning or losing, the house is  still making their money.  They take a cut of every pot that's raked in. 
[01:37:00]  You're right.  So, I don't see why they would do something that would jeopardize all the money that's  pouring in to, you know, put some plants at a few tables.  Look what Vegas does.  I'm saying that there's always these angles, only because they can do it.  But look what Vegas does with the pumping oxygen in and all these weird little things.  If they could get away with having a computer generate stuff, like you think the slot machines  are on us because they can fix them, you know you're not going to win.  That Wheel of Fortune game, I want to put my fist through every time I get 30 or 20.  There's a gaming commission.  It's not just the casino that's turning socket wrenches in the slot machine so they pay out.  There's a gaming commission that inspects these machines and makes sure they're completely 
[01:37:30]  random and that the casino isn't fiddling with it.  The slot machines aren't fixed in Vegas.  I don't know.  They're not.  There's a commission that's put in charge of making sure that it has no link to the casino.  Did you see the problems they gave Ace?  I don't believe that commission at all.  I understand.  You Jewel motherfucker, you ever go over my head again, I'll kill you. 
[01:38:00]  My favorite Pesci accent as well.  Oh, that one was good.  Kansas City's the greatest.  I'm playing Splinter Cell now.  All right.  Good game.  Let's go to James in North Carolina.  James?  Hey, what's up, y'all?  Hey, man.  What's up, James?  I was talking about Evercrack.  Yeah, it's pretty addictive.  It caused me to lose my fiancee over it.  Everquest?  Evercrack, yeah.  Wait, what did you call it?  Evercrack.  It's pretty well called that here.  She lost her mind, so she decided to jump on a bus and cut her hair. 
[01:38:30]  Well, I caught her later on.  I was going to school to finish up some college, and I had walked in on her fucking one of my best friends.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  But, dude, the game is called Everquest, right?  Yeah.  Oh, I got the latest one out, Everquest 2, Evercrack 2.  What do you call it?  It's called Everquest 2. 
[01:39:00]  The newest one out is called Everquest 2.  Why do you call it something else?  I'm not sure what you're saying.  Oh, Evercrack.  Oh, I'm not sure what you're saying.  Oh, I'm not sure what you're saying.  That's pretty original, though.  I've never heard it called out.  Is that because it's addicting?  Yeah, it's very addicting.  I mean, like you were talking about the poker thing a couple days ago, about playing eight hours a day kind of thing.  Yeah.  I'd call it sick most of the time.  This would play up.  What do you call it? 
[01:39:30]  It's called Everquest, but we call it Evercrack.  Dude, LOL.  So you guys call it Evercrack because it's addicting as opposed to the name which is Everquest?  Correct.  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  What's your name?  James.  James, okay.  So it'd be kind of like the same thing.  Like instead of a jame gum. 
[01:40:00]  What name is a jame?  Wait a minute, was she a great big fat person?  Oh, let's play that going into break.  I don't think the new listeners have heard that.  Oh, which one?  The lotion?  Dude, I was watching it yesterday on USA.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, thanks.  We're on to something else.  The ADD show continues here.  We should take a break.  But speaking of Silence of the Lambs.  Oh, fantastic.  We're going to play Silence of the Lambs, the musical.  The musical.  The CD that's...  Extravaganza.  Yeah, by the Kaplan brothers.  We even talked to them. 
[01:40:30]  It's hilarious.  Yeah.  They were music majors, and they realized, oh, God, this is useless.  So why don't we try to do something on our own?  So they made Silence of the Lambs the musical, these two guys.  Which track are we going to hear?  It puts the crack in the basket.  Put the fucking lotion in the basket.  It has to be that one.  We haven't heard this one in a while.  It's a hit, dude.  As we go to break, take a listen.  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  It does this when it's told.  It rubs the lotion on its skin. 
[01:41:00]  Or else it gets the hose.  And when it's done, there's one more thing.  A simple little task.  It's put the fucking lotion in the basket.  Put the fucking lotion in the basket.  All these stupid women are the same.  It helps me not to think of them as human.  So I call them itch instead of by their names. 
[01:41:30]  Mister, please, no more abuse.  Can't you see there's no excuse?  My family's probably wondering where I've been.  Most of you, so your skin gets loose.  Stop crying now, you bitch, fat moose.  Just put the fucking lotion on your skin.  And then put the fucking lotion in the basket.  Your chances for survival are remote.  I'm impervious to all your silly whining, so. 
[01:42:00]  I'm down before I jam up off.  I'm down your fucking throat.  Mister, please, my mom's got money.  Let me go, this isn't funny.  Cops are sure to send somebody.  Turn me loose, don't be a dummy.  Listen to your scream and wail.  Keep it down, you fucking wail.  Mind the broken fingernail.  The last girl climbed halfway, but failed. 
[01:42:30]  Precious?  She's down here, you piece of shit.  Put the fucking boodle in the basket.  I'd kill you, but there's someone at the door.  Don't make me go and get my gun and shoot you.  It's a waste of skin.  They don't sell bad girls in a fucking store. 
[01:43:00]  Put my fucking precious in the basket.  Don't you hurt my one and only friend.  You don't know what fate is, but I'll teach you.  If you lay a fucking finger on my poodle's pretty head.  Put the fucking boodle in the basket.  Pipson!  Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.  Get an old Leary, Leary, Leary. 
[01:43:30]  Needed a head, needed a drawing.  Himmager, himmager, himmager, himmager, himmager.  Well, then what's that?  Yeah, which, what?  Why?  Where?  Sure.  What?  What?  Who?  Bull, why?  We have problems.  Shake it up.  Shake it up.  Shake it up.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony program. 
[01:44:00]  Dave Grohl rules.  He really does.  He's the best drummer ever.  Yeah, he's drumming on that one.  Yeah, we're spreading the virus across America thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  The O&A virus, we like to call it.  And really fast, here we go.  We're going to go off on a little tangent.  And we have so much more stuff to do.  Who is this playing, by the way?  Queens of the Stone Age. 
[01:44:30]  That's good.  Their new album is pretty good as well.  I was watching The Shining over the weekend.  Oh, you did?  And, yeah, we just had a quick movie.  Are you trying to make believe that I didn't tell you that I saw The Shining over the weekend?  I said it's a fun movie.  You hack.  Oh, you did, did ya?  We just had a 20-minute conversation about The Shining.  I think our listeners know.  I just throw those things in every so often.  Like, you'll say something.  I'll go, really, O?  Oh, you did, did ya?  They know I did. 
[01:45:00]  I'm actually speaking for the audience.  And because you said that, then the listeners could think that we're just brilliant because  we're just doing this off the top of our heads.  Right.  The spontaneity on the show just amazes me.  I consider myself sometimes the voice of the audience.  So, as you say, I saw The Shining.  I'm one of the audience members that's going, oh, you did, did ya?  While Queens of the Stone Age was playing, you did not just tell me a whole story about  the hotel.  Yeah, I did. 
[01:45:30]  All right.  I was talking about a hotel in Colorado.  Oh, I was saying, it was really fast.  I was thinking about The Shining.  Jesus, this music really creeps me out.  By the way, that's got to be from the TV show.  That couldn't be from the film.  That's got to be from the TV show.  That's awful.  Yeah, but there was a few different, this is the TV, right?  Oh, wait, no, wait.  There's sound.  Oh, it's the movie?  Okay.  Okay.  I'm nervous.  It's titled When Jack Goes Psycho.  Oh, it is. 
[01:46:00]  Which time?  But it was just a quick little thing.  I was watching The Shining thinking, who in their right mind would, and he was supposed  to be in his right mind to begin.  At the time, yeah.  To begin the movie.  Would take that job.  I wouldn't take that job if it was spring.  Some people like seclusion, I think.  Seclusion.  Yeah.  Have you ever been in any of these old hotels, maybe upstate New York or wherever?  They're creepy as hell, man.  Very creepy.  I stayed at the Park Plaza, which they're renovating finally, and some dope decided to be the last 
[01:46:30]  guest out of there, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  So the news did a big thing on the last guest leaving the hotel.  That guy wanted to be the last guy to check out.  Oh, shut up.  That guy.  Leave.  What a tool.  Yeah, it happens with everything in society, but the last person in a marathon and all that.  Yeah.  I stayed at the Park Plaza once.  It was haunted.  Yeah.  It had to be.  You hearing stuff?  Well, I didn't hear anything, but it's so old, you just get this overwhelming vibe. 
[01:47:00]  A vibe.  Feeling like there is something going on here.  You're absolutely right.  I stayed at a place in Colorado, and it was like one of the inspirations for the Overlook  Hotel.  It's very old, late 18, early 1900s.  The thing was built.  All kinds of lore and stories to it.  And you get into your room, and there's these little dittos and whatnot laying around. 
[01:47:30]  Askew.  Askew on your table.  And there are stories.  There are ghost stories and haunting stories in the hotel.  Things that have happened in the hotel.  Things people have seen.  There's this one story of a young girl that walks around from room to room asking for her  mother.  And I got to sleep in this place?  I'm walking upstairs.  Now you're walking through the hallway.  It's not a modern hotel.  There's no Holiday Inn.  The hallway is very big, very grand. 
[01:48:00]  Very wide, right?  Very wide.  That's on the Park Plaza.  The hallways are really wide.  The ceilings.  The carpet is that old-style carpet.  And you're walking down this, and old doors on either side of the hallway.  And I'm looking at the end of the hallway going, if I see something, I'm going to drop  dead right here.  If I see some ghostly figure at the end of this hallway, it's over, Johnny.  Why is that kid driving his big wheel up and down the halls?  You don't need to go to room 237. 
[01:48:30]  Unbelievable.  Why do they want to creep you out?  They're telling stories of murders and people that have died in the hotel.  There's no fun in that whatsoever.  No.  It just makes it creepy.  And it's fine in the daytime when a lot of people are walking around, and it's just a  hotel, a working hotel.  You read the things and kind of get a little chug.  Ooh, that's creepy.  And then when night settles in, you're like, oh boy, why did I read that?  Because now I'm just completely creeped out, and I'm going to have trouble sleeping. 
[01:49:00]  Little girl knocking on doors looking for her mother.  What'd you do, sleep naked with candy next to the bed?  Yeah, night.  Mommy.  Mommy.  Mommy.  Oh.  Stop it.  Night makes everything just worse.  Oh, it's just the creepiest.  All of a sudden, you can't even go to your kitchen to get a stupid glass of water.  Afraid to look out the window.  It's all dark out there, and if I see a pair of eyes peering in, it's over. 
[01:49:30]  I can't.  I am the biggest scaredy cat ever.  I don't really consider myself a scaredy cat.  I am.  I'm fessing up.  I am a scaredy cat.  But all of a sudden, you watch The Shining or something, and then go to bed, and there's  many nights where I'll stagger to the bathroom or the kitchen to get a glass of water.  Now, I got a full bladder.  I'm not moving.  No, you don't want to move.  I'm not moving.  No.  You walk around.  You ever think you see something at night, and you just creep the hell out of it?  Sometimes I'll just look down.  I'll just look down, praying that there's nothing there. 
[01:50:00]  Sometimes I wake up, and a hat will be hanging on something, and it looks like someone's just  hovering over the bed.  It's so creepy, and I am just, I get scared so easily.  Can't have anyone creep up on me.  My girlfriend's kind of the same way.  She's pretty jittery when it comes to being scared like that.  So we're ridiculous. 
[01:50:30]  If I walk into a room that she's in already, and her back is turned to something, I have  to start whistling before I even get there.  She's got to do the same thing.  If I'm sitting at the computer, and my back is to the room, and she's walking in the room,  she comes in.  Ah-dee-dee-dee-dum.  You know, just so it's not like, hi, honey.  You know, right behind me.  Ah!  I just jump through the ceiling.  That's a frightening household.  Just two humming germophobes.  Don't touch anything, I'm singing, no germs, no one gets scared. 
[01:51:00]  What a loony bin.  Yeah, there's something going on there, man.  A lunatic.  There's definitely something going on.  Germophobes.  It was supposed to be a quickie, though.  It's ridiculous that Jack Nicholson even took that job.  Yeah.  He didn't write much.  With a family.  But he needed a little seclusion to write.  That was like his whole thing.  He wants to write his book.  It's probably the perfect opportunity.  He wouldn't be alone because he's got his family with him.  I know.  I get it.  But, you know.  I get it.  Well, he had a complaint from the manager saying that you're not being a good caretaker. 
[01:51:30]  And he starts crying.  Oh, you would have criticized the way I am being the caretaker.  I've had a really rough time.  I mean, it was a really great movie.  I just want to take care of the hotel.  You know who's a scaredy cat?  Club Soda Kenny, I learned driving back from.  We were talking about horror films.  He's like, I can't watch them.  I get very frightened.  Big Club Soda Kenny.  And he wasn't being ironic.  He really is just a big sissy when it comes to horror films.  Movies scare the crap out of me.  And the advertisements for movies have gotten so bad. 
[01:52:00]  It used to be, all right, that movie looks pretty creepy.  I'll see it on my own time, during the daytime perhaps, something like that.  But now the advertisements on TV are just as bad as the movie.  And they come on in the middle of the night.  And when the ring and the grudge came out, and they pop on, and you see these creepy little  pale children, like, popping up out of nowhere, scares the crap out of me.  Your brother wants in.  Brother Joe, what's up, buddy?  Yo, what's going on?  Hey, man.  How do you do, Joe? 
[01:52:30]  I wanted to shed some light on why I believe Anthony is such a scaredy cat.  Oh, this is true.  Okay, I know exactly where you're going.  And you're probably right.  You know what I'm telling, right?  Yeah.  When we were kids, I'd say, I don't know, Anthony had to be about eight, maybe seven,  eight years old.  We had just finished watching the movie Psycho.  Yeah.  And Anthony and...  Jesus, how old are you guys?  We weren't at the movies, Opie.  Jesus.  It was on television. 
[01:53:00]  We just came back from a Citizen Kane screening.  I believe it was on Creature Feature or Chiller Theater.  You might want to explain that.  We're trying to act that we're a lot younger on the radio here.  It was a double feature.  What?  Yeah, like we went to the movies.  Elvira introduced it.  The original one.  TV.  You are familiar with it.  All right.  All right.  So anyway, Anthony decides to take a shower immediately following the murder scene. 
[01:53:30]  Hairless, young, seven-year-old boy in the shower.  As Anthony was in the shower, I took Dawn into my mom's room to fit her with a wig.  Yeah.  And give her a better knife.  Jesus.  And as Anthony was in the shower, I took Dawn to run into the bathroom, throw the shower curtain open, and start screaming. 
[01:54:00]  And we had this better knife in the way I had.  Anthony went down like a sack of wet potatoes.  He went down straight to the bottom of the top.  I collapsed in the bathtub in fear and fright.  And I was hysterical.  I was hysterical and inconsolable.  There was no way I was sane.  You were catatonic for an hour.  Yeah, for an hour.  I just was staring going, I was petrified.  Did she run out screaming, too?  My brother has a python growing from the front of him. 
[01:54:30]  No, I wasn't in the shower, Jim.  Oh, man.  Unbelievable.  That is funny.  Yeah.  I remember that.  That's classic.  And believe me, Psycho, as a kid, back then, was just a very scary movie.  And, yeah, for some reason, I don't know.  Why did I decide to take a shower right after Psycho?  Because you're hot.  Seven years old.  Yeah.  That's true.  I want to see if any pubes were growing in yet. 
[01:55:00]  I want to wash off that little clamshell-like bag.  Young, svelte Anthony doing voices, washing his body.  Hi, I'm Howdy Doody.  He's just cleaning under his arms.  Howdy Doody, like 1950.  I don't know what impressions you did as a kid.  Hey, why don't you wash your hair?  Oh.  Yeah, the only hair I had to wash was on my head.  No other hair on that body.  That's funny. 
[01:55:30]  Okay.  Oh, God.  Yeah, that might have had something to do with it.  I didn't even think of that.  I remember not only Harmoves, but one other time,  my father, in his infinite wisdom,  decided it would be a good idea to take the whole family out to the drive-in movie out there.  I remember when Comac used to have a big drive-in movie over there.  Back in the olden days.  Shut up, you remember.  Shut up.  Wow.  Next to the regular movie theater, right across the street from the Comac Motor Inn.  We're going to keep you under the bus for a while.  Was it hard to hear the movie with the T-Birds riding around? 
[01:56:00]  Drive-in movies.  Drive-in movies.  I remember there was one way out in, like, Rocky Point.  I really don't remember one in Comac.  There was one in Comac for quite some time.  I really don't remember that one.  I'm sorry.  You absolutely do remember it.  I swear.  It's where Target is now.  All right.  I believe you.  There was a big drive-in theater that everybody went to. 
[01:56:30]  So what happened?  You pulled the Edsel up?  Well, we went there and the lords were there.  The lords indeed pulled the Edsel up.  Me and Frank will go buy letters for the sign.  Hey, I heard you got a bun in the oven.  Were you double dating with Fonzie?  No, I wasn't double dating with Fonzie.  That was the episode, right?  It was one of the drive-ins, though,  because the later drive-in movie theaters,  right before they totally disappeared,  you were able to tune your radio in to the movie. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, wow.  But this one was one where you took the big clunky speaker  and put it on your window.  I remember the speaker.  Sometimes people drove off with it.  And he decided we were going to see Bonnie and Clyde.  Remember Bonnie and Clyde, the movie?  Yes, I do, Anthony.  Remember Bonnie and Clyde?  Yes, I do.  And that had come out, and I was like,  I don't know, seven, seven years old.  All right.  And the scene came where people started really getting shot,  and it was very bloody, 
[01:57:30]  and I threw my Arby's up.  Remember Arby's was right there?  Sure.  And I threw my Arby's up all over the car.  Yeah, puked all over the place.  Because I couldn't take it.  I was a kid.  I was a little kid.  Very young at the drive-in.  Not, I didn't drive there.  But the blood looked.  I had my blankie with me.  But the blood looked really fake in that movie.  Didn't matter.  All right.  It was just the whole thing of them getting shot apart and stuff.  I puked my Arby's all over.  All right. 
[01:58:00]  My dad took me to see a movie in the drive-in years ago,  and I remember the next movie he was playing was The Sensuous Nurse with Ursula Andress.  Ooh.  And I wanted to stay and watch it, but he wouldn't.  Aw.  Which is probably better that he didn't.  Yeah.  You know, a man and his son just pitching tents watching her run around the Swedish cocktees.  Me, my dad, and his wife in California went to the drive-in movie theater once  and saw Barbarella, and it was not a first run.  It had come out and made a resurgence ass.  And I remember the windows were getting all steamed up because I was breathing so heavy at the beginning scenes. 
[01:58:30]  No way, really.  Because she's naked in the beginning scene of that.  It's like the credits, but it's kind of silhouette.  It's kind of hard.  But you could definitely make out the form of a nude woman.  Right.  And your little body was heating up.  I'm sitting.  I swear to you, I was sitting by the passenger window.  Corey, his wife, was sitting in the middle, and my father's sitting in the driver's seat.  And as the movie is going on, the beginning is playing, the windows are...  I was burning up, and I couldn't even contain my breathing. 
[01:59:00]  And the windows are getting all fogged up.  Was she just jerking both of you off?  You laugh, but, man, we've gone down this road with Anthony.  No.  You want to talk about a good egg.  Anthony's father was a good egg.  There was nothing going on between me and my stepmother.  Getting Anthony laid as much as humanly possible your father did.  No, just one time he hooked me up.  I don't know about that.  One time with Buzz.  With good old Buzz.  That's it.  All right, let's go to Eric in Colorado. 
[01:59:30]  Eric.  Hey.  Hey.  I don't know which one it was.  I'm not sure.  Wait, you know the hotel aunt's talking about in Colorado?  Yeah, it's called Hotel Colorado, Glenwood Springs.  Yep.  And it is notoriously haunted.  That's the one I stayed at.  Yep.  Yeah.  It is notoriously haunted.  And there have been Ghostbusters who have proven, you know, these paranormal experts have  proven that it is haunted.  Dude, and I friggin' stayed there. 
[02:00:00]  I was so petrified.  The one that's in the Shining is out here also.  It's called the Stanley.  And it's up in Estes Park.  And that one's haunted also.  I don't doubt it.  Very creepy.  Were the internal shots, I think the external for the Shining was actually a set that they  built.  Yeah.  No, the internal was a set.  The external is of the Stanley.  Oh, really?  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it's, I mean, that's like a four-star hotel.  But it's, I mean, it is haunted also.  But that Hotel Colorado, man, it's, when I was in high school, a lot of my friends who 
[02:00:30]  would go there on band trips, they'd go there for a practice, man, they said that you don't  go up on that floor after dark.  Really?  Yeah, they said it is really spooky up there.  And a lot of the hotel staff has reported seeing things.  And they've had paranormal experts go up there and say, yeah, it's, there's definitely something  going on up there.  Yeah, they had stories about something in the furnace room downstairs.  And you'd hear things on the pipes.  And, you know, the, the, the spa cave that's right down, right across from there, some of 
[02:01:00]  those areas in the spa caves are also.  So, yeah, I went, Anthony went to the spa cave, it was, it was haunted by a ghost with  stinky feet.  That place reeked.  Yeah, it is.  Hey, I got a question for you.  The, the, what's it called, the Stanley, is the internal at all like the film was?  You know, I've never been inside of it, but I, I, I, I, that's what I've been told.  I think there were a lot of inspirations based on other hotels that were, you know, the  big towering ceilings and huge rooms.  Does it look the same now as it did in the movie?  And don't lie or I'll know. 
[02:01:30]  No, they, it's, it's been renovated, they renovate it, but it looks pretty much the  same on the outside.  I mean, it's a, it's a huge stately hotel.  If you go to their website, you'll see the pictures of it.  All right.  Thanks, Eric.  Sure.  Yeah, I was petrified in that hotel, man.  It was just so scary.  It's just a feeling to get, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Creepy.  Road Dog the trucker.  What's up, Road Dog?  Oh, what's happening?  Oh.  Where are you, bro?  Ah, Greenville, North Carolina.  All right.  Fun, fun, fun.  What do you got for the show? 
[02:02:00]  Do what?  What do you got, man?  Man, I got to tell you about this.  As a kid growing up, Southern Indiana there, there's a Triple X Theater establishment, and  they had a drive-in movie theater with a big drive-in screen, and they'd show Triple X  rated movies all night long on this big drive-up screen.  All the kids would build tree houses just to get up and do the same thing.  Triple X at a drive-in, huh?  So you build the tree house nice and high so you get a peek?  No, they had like 14-foot fences around the damn place.  They had to go up into a tree or ride by on the interstate. 
[02:02:30]  You'd be going down the interstate and see a naked woman on the damn screen going down  the road.  Naked woman blowing a 20-foot cock.  You realize it's just Ben Sparks.  I'd go cut from poltergeist to porno.  All right on, man.  All right, Road Dog.  I'll push it out, man.  Y'all be safe.  Thank you, Road Dog, everyone.  A bunch of smart asses dug out, Doug.  Anthony and Buzz and Fonzie and Pinky decking at the drive-in.  Jackass.  All right, we could do riding on the bus with my sister. 
[02:03:00]  With my sister.  You want to get into this a little bit?  We also have Laura Bush doing stand-up.  Yeah, she wowed him in Washington.  Sort of like Family Guy, I don't know.  I had high expectations, so I'm not really sure.  I didn't catch him.  I'm going to have to do well.  It didn't stink, but whatever.  All right, what do you want to do, riding on the bus?  Yeah, let's get into that a little bit.  I just think we should watch where the jokes go.  I think that let's not target the mentally challenged.  I agree with you. 
[02:03:30]  Take the high road.  Yeah.  All right.  I like how, actually, even though it's radio, he puts the serious face on.  You know, guys, there's not even a hint of a smile.  I'm a method actor.  He's acting.  He really has to get into the character.  You know, all right, let me really think that I don't want to make jokes about this.  All right, all right.  I'll wait.  Okay.  There was Rosie O'Donnell. 
[02:04:00]  I got to admit, I took a peek after Family Guy.  Ugh.  It was not just an awful movie because of the content and Rosie O'Donnell being a horrible actress  and just running through as a parody of a retarded person.  The movie itself, taken just as a movie, was so bad.  It was so disjointed and cliches left and right.  They kept throwing in these little things that lasted for a second that were supposed to make you think about something, I guess. 
[02:04:30]  I don't know.  There was one part where they tried to get into this little story of this pervert that drives around  and gives Rosie O'Donnell's retard character a stuffed animal in the car and goes,  here you go.  And he looks all ratty and he pulls up slowly as she's walking on the sidewalk  and she grabs the stuffed animal and then walks a little like, oh, no, and puts it in the garbage  and goes, that guy always tries to give me things. 
[02:05:00]  And then that was it.  Dude, it lasted for like five seconds.  Like, oh, the retards have to watch for the perverts.  Yes, okay, I understand where they were going.  Because that's what's happening out there.  Yeah, yeah.  What is the pervert retarded, too?  When you looked at...  I think that you're missing the message, Anthony.  Yeah, what was it?  The message there, that's the message to the parents, where if you have one of these,  this is what you should do with it.  Walk right outside, lift the lid.  Toss it in the garbage.  But they tried little things like that, like they were trying to make these points, 
[02:05:30]  but they were covered so quickly, like, okay, let's cover the pervert trying to pick her up.  All right, let's get the mean, intolerant people on the bus.  Like, she gets on the bus and there's the bus drivers, which are all, every one of them,  very tolerant, very nice to her, very understanding.  And then a couple of passengers that, as viewers, you're supposed to hate.  Because they're like, what is she doing on this bus?  She doesn't have the proper past.  She's annoying.  And they're saying all this out loud, like no one would ever speak this shit. 
[02:06:00]  You say it under your breath and you kick them while they're not looking.  Things like fun, things like that.  Pinch their side fat.  Yeah, oh, get away from me.  And then one of the most unrealistic parts of the movie,  when somebody getting on the bus needed a nickel, didn't have a nickel,  and a black gentleman actually gave a nickel.  I saw that scene.  I'm like, stop it.  I was Rosie's sister there.  He looked like a thug.  He looked like a thug, but he's very charitable.  Well, then she tries to give him a dollar.  And he's like, yo, lady, you can't buy anything for five cents nowadays. 
[02:06:30]  Uh-huh.  Something like that.  And then there was one intolerant black woman.  Rosie gets on the bus, and she starts making retard faces at these two black children that are sitting there.  And the black woman saw that the children were making faces back,  and she kind of takes them by the hands and moved her seat.  She went to the back of the bus, which somebody on Wackbag right when it happened wrote,  well, I guess old habits die young. 
[02:07:00]  Or something like that.  Old habits die hard.  Oh, I suck.  But apparently.  What's your favorite song, Only the Good Die Hard?  Only the Good Die Hard.  What a tool.  I stink.  Now we know what you meant.  Yeah, so did I.  Unfortunately, it came out of my mouth like diarrhea.  That's all right.  Jim in Philly thought the movie wasn't that bad.  Jim?  What?  Yes.  Hey, Jim.  All right. 
[02:07:30]  Hi, faggot.  Yeah, I'm a faggot.  Hi, Jimmy.  I bought your new CD.  It's pretty good.  Thank you very much.  Why are you breathing like you just ate it?  Because I'm a fat fuck.  That's honest.  Well, there goes that question.  You like the movie there, Jim?  Yes, I do.  I had a retarded sister, and it brought back a lot of things.  Did she ride the bus?  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  No.  It brought back a lot of what?  Like a lot of memories?  A lot of bad... 
[02:08:00]  Oh, yeah, a lot of bad...  My brother and I were constantly in fights, you know, protecting her, and, you know, because  people would make fun of her and shit.  That seemed very unrealistic.  Yeah, what would they say to your sister?  What would they say to her?  A lot later.  Hey, you fucking retard.  Oh!  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Okay!  Yeah.  But she didn't talk like fucking Pee Wee Herman.  No.  Nah.  Is she still around?  Is she still around?  No, she died when she was 26. 
[02:08:30]  Ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Hello?  Yes.  Oh, there you go.  What, that, you guys can't...  That's not cool, man.  What did she pass away from?  Uh, well, they said natural causes, but I suspect it was sleep apnea.  Ha ha ha ha!  Why a lot of, uh, retarded people have the sleep apnea?  Well, she was heavy, too, and I have sleep apnea, because I'm a very heavy person.  I thought it might have been that big, thick tongue getting in the way while she was sleeping.  Oh, God.  I could have been.  She ain't heavy. 
[02:09:00]  She's my retarded sister.  That's true.  Very, very...  And I do drive a bus in Philadelphia, and we do get a bus.  I do get a lot of retarded people.  You do?  Are you very...  Are you the tolerant bus driver?  Um, sometimes, sometimes not.  Yeah.  Wow.  When they stand up at the bus, and they start fucking hollering and screaming, you know,  you got to kind of put an hand in it.  Yeah, that's what you see.  Yeah, that's great.  That's what you want to deal with.  He had a sister that was retarded.  He's not tolerant. 
[02:09:30]  You just want to get through your day driving a bus, and you get this in the back.  Ah!  Make somebody stop at that other bus stop!  Ha ha!  But the one truth in the story was, is a lot of them that get on do know everything  there is to know about buses, bus lines, and everything.  Yeah, that's quite a resume stuffer.  Great.  Well, most of them don't work, or they do menial jobs for the IRS.  Why do they choose...  Wait, wait, wait.  Who do they work for? 
[02:10:00]  I get a lot of them that work for the IRS, International Revenue Service.  International Revenue Service.  Did you say the International Revenue Service?  I deserved a car crash on that.  Of course you did.  That was a bus crash, because the, A, retards working for the IRS was the joke, and International,  they don't tax us in Greece and Europe and here.  It's internal, sir.  The International Revenue Service.  All right.  Well, Jim liked the movie.  Yeah. 
[02:10:30]  And I appreciate you touring on me.  All right, Jim.  Bye, Jim.  Have a good one, guys.  See you.  I like those Die Young movies.  The three that came out.  Bruce Willis.  Old Habits Die Young.  Oh, it's an ass.  All right.  Here we go.  Riding the bus with my sister.  What else were you going to say about this movie?  A lot, another thing that was going on during the whole thing, and I don't know if this  was just part of Rosie's contract or the character was supposed to be like this.  She was eating in every scene.  Eating in every single scene. 
[02:11:00]  And she was unhealthy.  She went to the doctor, and the doctor told her she's overweight and stuff, and somebody  pointed out on the message board that this woman is, this doctor is bashing Rosie's character,  yet it's still Rosie that she's telling is unhealthy.  The only difference is this retarded character didn't wash her hair.  That was like the only difference between the retard and Rosie.  So this woman's saying how unhealthy and fat Rosie is as the retard.  Meanwhile, she didn't have padding on her or anything. 
[02:11:30]  She's just fat.  Oh, that's great.  So they're pounding her.  That's awesome.  Yeah, fat clay legs with no Ben Marks on them.  And, you know, I know it's very, you know, hack, as a comic, to talk of the big head gag.  The big head, that's a big head!  You know, but her head is giant.  She has this, that big, fat head.  And at one point she was getting a hairstyle.  Her hairstyle, her sister took her, and they formed her curly locks into a perfect mullet. 
[02:12:00]  Could not possibly have made her look more retarded.  You know who should cut her hair?  David Ferry and Clay Shaw.  Oh, oh.  Hmm.  Eh.  Yeah.  I'm thinking.  Yeah.  I, I got it.  JFK.  Yeah.  I, I got it.  Didn't really go over well on it.  All right.  Do you want to play some clips then?  You didn't say die young.  Well, he did.  Here's Rosie's character on the phone, I guess. 
[02:12:30]  I'm trying to use that phone!  No, that's peewee.  Yes, daddy.  Hi, honey.  You okay?  Yes, I'm okay.  I'm okay, because I'm the sheriff.  Okay.  Yeah.  You have to take me to Super Save tomorrow, because I have a sale.  Okay, I'm going to pick you up at 6?  Yeah, 6.30.  I love you.  I have to go.  I have to go catch a bus.  Oh, I have to go catch a bus.  Oh, you are a bus, you pig. 
[02:13:00]  Okay.  Why are you so tolerant of the record?  I'm the sheriff.  No, you're not, stupid.  I'm the sheriff.  Somebody had the storyline all wrong, also.  They told us that at the end, she gets a bum leg.  Yeah, yeah.  And has to live with them.  And then I realized that was the storyline of Bill.  Somebody was trying to fool us.  Oh, okay.  That was the storyline of old Bill.  We don't have our Bill clips.  Played a retard.  We have to get the Bill clips.  It was, I had a bad leg, and I have to live with Barry. 
[02:13:30]  And that's what happened.  He had a bum leg.  He would have had to go back to the home.  Oh, okay.  So he lived with the...  Someone got one past that, huh?  I know.  I didn't realize it until last night, when I'm like, hey, wait, it didn't end like that.  That's one of our favorite comedies.  Of course it is.  How did it end?  I didn't see it.  Well, it ended the sister...  Well, the father that she's talking to on the phone, he dies.  He winds up dying.  And now he took care of Rosie's character, for the most part.  Rosie lived alone, but I guess he helped her out, whatever. 
[02:14:00]  So now the sister, who is a very successful career woman, has to now come and kind of take  care of her a little bit, and leave her job for a while, and she winds up breaking up with  her fiancé because of the problem with the sister.  Yeah, that would happen in real life.  Yeah.  Of course.  Because...  She's a mess!  Sorry.  And now the movie is pretty much the sister trying to get a better understanding of her  retarded sister, because they haven't been together in years. 
[02:14:30]  She's been a busy career girl, you know.  Doesn't even acknowledge she's got this retard for a sister.  What's there to understand?  Nothing.  This movie was so shallow, and it had nothing to it.  They can't even watch the same TV programs.  So they drive on the bus together, and then Rosie tries hooking her up with the bus drivers.  This is my sister, and she broke up with a boyfriend, and she reads books, and she...  Oh, and she just kind of smiles, like it's okay, instead of slapping her on the face and  telling her to shut up like any normal human would do. 
[02:15:00]  She should have pinched the back of her arm and just said, shut up.  Yeah, shut up.  Ow!  Here's the argument on the stairs, Anthony.  What was this about?  I don't know.  I couldn't even understand the movie.  All right.  I was a retard watching it.  What do you think you are, a hippopotamus?  The way you clomp down the steps every morning?  Some people are still sleeping.  Not you.  You're not sleeping.  You're complaining.  That's what you're doing. 
[02:15:30]  You're the hippopotamus!  Yeah, that was her walking downstairs.  Wow, there's a lot of fat jokes in this movie, huh?  Well, yeah.  Well, she's fat.  Yeah, a big black woman is yelling at her for clomping down the stairs.  Every day, you're a first person on my bus.  Yeah.  You'd kill somebody to get on first.  I wouldn't.  I wouldn't kill.  It's got no place to go.  It just rides around all day.  So, it's a free country.  I'm a person.  I buy my bus pass for 40 bucks, and I'm first always, so that's why I'm first. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, you're doing it on the government dole.  Why don't you do something useful in your life?  Okay, Henry.  Where is Beth going today?  I'm going to go to Alma.  Now I'm going to catch a bus with Rick.  Ah, Rick is your new favorite.  Yeah, because he has a green car and he's cute.  The green Mustang.  Very classy.  Yeah.  Oh, I think he's going to take me for a ride in it.  What about your boyfriend?  What about Jesse? 
[02:16:30]  Jesse's delicious.  He's going to take me today to get a new toilet seat because mine got broken and was sliding.  So, I would fall off a bit like, whoa.  Fat ass on a fat retarded ass broke the toilet seat.  Why did somebody cut Henry off?  I really liked him.  Henry was telling it like it is.  She had a boyfriend, by the way.  She had a boyfriend, Jesse, who was this big retarded black guy.  So, she, and apparently they were having sex and everything. 
[02:17:00]  Was he saying Camo?  Camo.  Camo with glass dildos.  Camo.  Yeah, that was another, you know, this whole thing was just full of this politically correct drivel.  Just awfulness.  Like the people in the bus, the angry people, you know.  Why don't you get a job instead of being on the government dole?  And you're supposed to look over and go, yeah, that person's mean and awful.  Oh, and it's like every two seconds these little things were popping up.  The intolerant gang of white guys that beat up the black, that were trying to beat up her black boyfriend. 
[02:17:30]  Of course.  And he knows Taekwondo.  Yeah, the retarded black boyfriend.  So, he kicked ass.  And he's got the retard strength, too.  Yeah, he had the retard strength.  And he kicked ass.  It's got to be kind of stupid to take on a guy like that.  People started getting ready to attack him.  And Rosie goes, it's getting hot in here.  It's getting hot in here.  And he ran over in his Taekwondo duds.  They criticized her.  And he went, you motherfuckers.  Chris on Long Island. 
[02:18:00]  Chris.  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  Don't think that Rosie sounds like Bonnie Gumbel from The Simpsons.  All right.  That's it.  That's good.  Sometimes it's Pee-Wee's.  All right.  Sometimes it's Bonnie.  It's just minus the burp, right?  That's good.  The worst part of it is I was only able to whack my bag twice during that movie.  Peace out.  Very good.  Guy had a really good call.  So, wait.  Not only was Rosie a retard, but she was in...  Oh, a two-time disappointer of the family. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, my God.  It's like, it just couldn't get any worse.  Daddy, mate.  I stand corrected.  Okay, it can.  That's nice.  And both races will be destroyed.  They'll create a mongrel race.  Jesus Christ.  That's great.  Andy McDowell was the sister. 
[02:19:00]  Yes.  She was the sister.  And I guess the beginning shot, the opening shot of the movie was pretty good.  She's kind of laying back on the bed, and her nips were showing through the sweater.  So, that was like the best part of the movie.  I'm my savior.  I'm not your savior.  I'm just Beth.  Cool Beth.  Beth, my girlfriend.  Oh, that's boring clothes.  What, am I scaring you?  Want me to scare you?  Boo, boo, boo!  Beth.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:19:30]  Bear no mind.  It's a harmless retard.  Just don't make eye contact.  I'm having you!  That is hilarious.  Oh, is that the best line ever?  Another intolerant person on the bus.  Meanwhile, to me, those are the best people so far.  Of course.  Hendry and those two.  Hendry.  They're an intolerant person.  It's just a harmless retard.  Don't make eye contact.  That's absolutely true.  Oh, wow.  Big dummy with panda legs. 
[02:20:00]  That's what she has.  Legs like a fat white panda.  She should be tugging a windbreaker through a cage.  Fat whore.  Panda.  I'm hearing you.  I'm hearing you.  But Rick, when you're going to take me for a ride in your car, in a green car, my case  work for a couple of us.  Oh, Olivia, huh?  Yes, Olivia.  She's pretty and she's nice.  Oh, that's a house where me and Eugene live. 
[02:20:30]  I think he's a jerk.  You think he's a jerk, Rick?  I don't think he's a jerk.  I think he's a little impatient.  Yeah, well, he put up that sign in the bathroom that says only employees can use it.  That didn't stop you, though, did it?  No, because I'm a person and it's just a bathroom.  If I use it, I don't think I'm hurting anybody.  Yeah.  That's great.  Sometimes I go in there and I don't have to go to the bathroom just to wash my hands  and make them mad. 
[02:21:00]  Just to wash my hands.  How stupid can one person be?  Sometimes I just wash my hands.  You work hard and that dummy walks in and takes one of her retard dumps.  There's gum and pennies in it.  Little shards of glass and fur. 
[02:21:30]  Gum and pennies.  That was part of the movie was that she ate everything, which is good for Rosie O'Donnell.  But as a kid, they did a lot of flashbacks where they showed her as a little kid, which  is great for the kid's image as an actress.  You know, you're really good.  I think you can play a fat retard.  Here you go.  You're only a fat retarded girl.  And she was eating everything.  She was outside eating dirt.  They had her eating dirt. 
[02:22:00]  They had her eating paint.  The paint.  She was trying to do a little painting and she was eating the paint.  And that's what Rosie grew into.  Somebody that just...  Oh, my God.  The inside of the toilet looks like Dreyfuss' living room in Close Encounters.  This means something.  I've got a big...  There's a mountain in my toilet.  I don't know. 
[02:22:30]  Maybe if I put some lines in the side, it'll ring a bell.  Be realistic, Rick.  Be...  Be...  Open your eyeballs and you can see that he's a little bit of a jerk.  Okay.  Okay.  Oh, Shanae, you're growing. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, I'm as big as a truck.  Oh, sit here, sit here.  You want a few of them kicks?  It's a pregnant woman.  Hold on.  Go ahead.  Put your hands on my tummy.  He's moving all over the place.  Wow.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, Rick.  Rick, you want to touch that?  I'm driving here, babe.  Yeah.  Yeah, I have something to show you.  Oh, yeah?  Look.  Oh.  They're my niece and my nephew, Alex O'Maddy.  Adorable. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, I love him so much.  I never met him, but my brother says, come bring him over, Bobby.  Sure are you.  They're cute.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Is the pregnant woman patting her own stomach and looking at the retard and then looking  stop going, please, God.  Please.  Please.  Hey, Rick, what are you doing?  Stop singing that song.  It's going to get you fired.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[02:24:00]  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh.  Wow.  Man.  Okay, Jesse, here they are.  I like the fishies.  What do you like?  Uh, this, this one, this one, this one's salt.  Retarded boyfriend.  Oh, but Jesse, that one's ugly.  Nobody wants to sit on that.  You know me.  I'm fussing.  Sit on.  Yeah.  We need some help.  I've got it.  Can we have assistance, please, in row number one for toilet seat? 
[02:24:30]  Ha, ha, ha.  Hello?  Ha, ha, ha.  Toilet seat assistance in row number one.  Thank you.  Okay.  Who wants to join, anyway?  What?  What?  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  She's atrocious.  Yeah, and, um, sweet corn smile from Syracuse.  Rosie sounds like the Saturday Night Live skit Amy Poehler does as the little girl.  Yeah.  Rack, rack, rack, rack, rack, rack, rack, rack, rack, rack, rack, rack.  Hey, over here! 
[02:25:00]  Ha, ha.  Oh, she is awful.  Oh, this is great.  It is so bad.  It's such a bad, you can't get over the put-on retard that she's doing.  This over-the-top bad, that's what I saw.  Oh, it's horrible.  So far, Henry and those other two guys are my favorite characters on television.  That sounds like the cookie monster a little bit, too.  C is for chromosome, which I do not have.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[02:25:30]  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Today's show is sponsored by the letter U.  Ugh.  All right, I guess this is where the movie gets very dramatic, Anthony.  The father has a heart attack.  Hangers are more for just than hanging your clothes.  Hangers are used for things other than just hanging your clothes. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, I feel good.  The father has a heart attack?  Yes, this is where the father dies.  I guess they have to call up Rosie, and she runs to the hospital, and it's trying to be a touching scene,  and it was nothing but humor.  It's just funny.  When was the last time she saw her father?  I talked to him all the time on the phone.  He was much too busy to visit her?  No, no, I guess he would visit her, too, and give her things.  So, you know, I guess they were close. 
[02:26:30]  What?  Yeah.  I tried to reach you at home, but I missed you.  Yes, I've already left.  Yeah, well, I was here.  Would you like a cocky chocolate flavor?  Very nutritious.  Eating again.  No, thanks.  But, um, is there someplace we can go?  What for?  Beth, your dad, uh, I'm afraid your father's had a heart attack.  Oh, no.  No.  I mean, my dad's taking me to the super save.  I'm going to go get ripped.  Fuck.  Beth.  Ow. 
[02:27:00]  Beth.  Um, slow down.  You've had, you've had surgery.  I, I think you might, you might just want to...  Move, move, move, move.  Excuse me, sorry.  Excuse me, I'm just going to...  The running retard scene.  The panicking retard.  Beth's dad is in the hospital.  Massive heart attack.  You okay, Beth?  Yeah, time to start the bus.  Let's go.  I'm pretty fucking far from okay.  Ah, you're going slow, Rick.  I'm going to report soon.  Beth.  No.  No, Olivia, everybody has a schedule. 
[02:27:30]  I've got a schedule.  We're going Happy Timmy's bus tonight.  That's why it is.  Beth, can I call someone for you?  Rick, you're cute, but your clothes are fading.  They're not very nice.  But you look at my clothes.  They're very bright.  I give everybody lots of color.  Where is he?  St. Matthew's.  Beth, listen to me.  No.  Your dad's in the hospital.  Yeah.  So I have to go to the hospital.  I'll take you there.  Now you're rude.  There's other people on the bus, by the way.  And he's just going to, you know, hey, we got to go to the hospital. 
[02:28:00]  That would happen in real life.  Excuse me.  That would happen.  Fired.  Where's your pass, fatso?  I don't have it.  Then get off.  You would be fired for that.  Of course.  You can't take the bus off the route.  All right.  Now she's visiting her father in the hospital.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, no.  Where's Simon?  Where's my daddy?  Where's my daddy?  Oh.  He's running through the hall.  He's in a coma.  He's unconscious. 
[02:28:30]  He won't even know you're here.  Yes, he will, because he's knowing.  I think it's important for Beth to see your dad.  Oh, I want to see him.  Oh, what?  Father's like finally in peace.  Oh, daddy.  I didn't want you to see him.  He's just pretending he can't hear her.  Oh, daddy.  He doesn't hurt you.  It's me, the sheriff.  Oh.  Can you hear me?  Oh, dad.  You're going to take me to the super safe today.  You have to wake up. 
[02:29:00]  You have to wake up.  Oh, it's you, me.  Dad, we make a good team.  It's you, me.  You're not going to die.  Okay.  Beth, please, not so loud.  But he's not going to die, right?  Maybe you'd like to come outside and sit down.  Baby, you should do something.  You just stand there.  You're doing nothing.  Beth, please, calm down.  It's time we let your dad rest.  No, it's not time.  I'm going to stay here.  It's not time.  You have to cooperate. 
[02:29:30]  You are not my mother.  You're not.  That doesn't mind you.  I was.  I'd have thrown myself down the stairs.  Oh, my God.  That was the heart-tugging scene.  That was the...  Rosie crying.  Now she's got to move on and get along without her dad to help her.  That's where her sister comes in.  I mean, there's a ton of clips still to go here.  Which ones do you want to go to?  I don't know.  Let me see.  They all stink. 
[02:30:00]  Birthday party on the bus.  How about the ones where bees sting her fat legs while she rolls around confused in the yard?  It was just such a horrible movie.  It's just her walking around pretty much doing what we've already heard.  This bad retard voice put in situations that garner her no sympathy whatsoever from the audience watching.  She's just an annoying...  Oh, well, there's the Hallmark retard commercial. 
[02:30:30]  All right.  Now, during this whole movie, which was sponsored by Hallmark 29,  sponsored by Hallmark,  every commercial break there were like two of these drama commercials.  They went on and on forever.  And it was supposed to, you know, be feel-good.  And one was how this little boy comes home from school,  and this teacher gave him a card because he was nice to another student  who was, like, developmentally challenged, I believe.  And the mother's very proud of her son for helping. 
[02:31:00]  And another one was this woman who was very successful comes back to visit a teacher that taught her this old man.  I guess it looked like he was retiring, too.  Gives him a card and stuff, and he says,  Wow, you've done very well in life.  What are you, a stockbroker or a lawyer?  And she goes, No, I'm a teacher.  And then Bob Kelly bursts into tears.  What do the cards say?  Roses are red, violets are blue.  Thanks for wrecking our family photographs, you genetic disaster. 
[02:31:30]  You.  No.  And then there was this one, which was, I guess, this woman.  She's in her office.  She comes across as a very stuffy, all-business kind of woman.  She leaves the office and goes to, I guess it's her brother, her retarded brother's house.  Yes, Jimmy? 
[02:32:00]  Oh, no.  I'm just thinking of another card he gives to the retard.  It's a picture of a dumpster in the back of a Planned Parenthood, and the card says,  Wish you were here.  Oh, my God.  Oh, I'm crying.  Oh, my God. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, I'm crying.  Yeah, so she goes over to her brother's house, I guess it is, and he's got Down syndrome.  He's very self-sufficient, and she gives him the card.  It's her interacting with her retarded brother.  Hey, Dave.  Hi, Trish.  Come on in.  You show me around? 
[02:33:00]  Sure.  This is my living room.  Great.  And this is my TV.  And down the hall.  That's where I jerk off 23 hours a day.  This is my bedroom.  He talks like Doug-out-Duck.  And this is my kitchen.  What are you cooking over there?  Oh, I'm making vegetable soup.  You look good.  Hungry?  I'm always hungry.  Not for your vegetable soup.  You got sticky, nasty fingers in there?  No.  Oh, vegetable soup. 
[02:33:30]  It's a bowl with three of the present.  Thanks.  Let's just look at it.  I'm so proud of you.  Reading the card.  I'm proud of you, too, Trish.  They had a close-up of his hands as he's opening the card. 
[02:34:00]  Right.  And you would think that they would have told him, hey, clip your nails.  He had these Ricky the Intern nails.  They're big and pointy.  And they were on the ends of fingers that looked like, you ever see a gecko?  The lizard?  Like they got those fat fingers on those little stubby.  What did it look like?  His, like, gecko hands.  His hands were all burnt because he wasn't heating up the soup.  He was heating up his own hands.  He was stirring it with his hand. 
[02:34:30]  I call the carrots Bob.  Shut up.  Stupid hallmark cards.  God, they got cards for everything now.  They got cards for retards.  You just learned to wipe your bottom.  Happy 35th birthday.  Bingo Pants from Whackbag.com.  Bingo Pants.  How you doing, guys?  What's up?  I want to see if, since Hallmark produced this thing, do you think they're now going to have  a section of cards for retards?  Like they can get their own parents and anniversary cards in. 
[02:35:00]  Do you guys, thanks for not taking a hanger to me.  Yeah.  Quentin out, guys.  Yeah.  That'll be good.  Too late.  Oh, man.  I noticed a couple more clips here that we want to play.  All right.  Let her rip.  Well, Beth wants to have a baby.  Oh, right.  Well.  This might be worth playing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She wanted to have a baby because she's in love with her boyfriend, Jesse, the black retarded  guy.  And they are having sex.  Ugh.  But they had a flashback scene where apparently the, um, the sister there and the father 
[02:35:30]  were a little leery of this whole thing.  So, um, they, uh, they had her tubes tied.  Oh!  And she couldn't have a baby and she was, uh, very disappointed with that.  Yes.  Smart parents, though.  Smart father and, uh, sister.  You should have given her a hyst...  Sorry, go.  Ah, it's okay.  I was just going to say this.  You should have given her a hysterectomy.  But I, I stopped myself short because I didn't have anything else.  And I was actually hoping the clip would play because I was like, yeah.  And then you stopped it and I'm like, ah. 
[02:36:00]  Could have tagged it with a spade shovel.  Yeah.  There we go.  Oh, Sinead, your baby.  Can I hold her?  Oh, Beth, I don't know.  It's so clean.  Of course you can hold her.  Are you sad?  Ten years since I can't have a baby.  That's what I'm thinking.  Are you sorry now that you can't have a baby?  I don't know. 
[02:36:30]  I don't know the baby.  Leave that baby with cry all the time.  But I would love it.  That's the most important thing.  We thought we were doing the right thing.  Now look, how much did you do with this?  Jesse.  Okay, hold it. Flashback.  Flashback with this father asking,  how much did you do with this Jesse?  Like they're trying to figure if she's sexually active,  and if she is, they've got to get her tubes tied.  And one of the highlights of the movies are later on in this scene, 
[02:37:00]  I guess it's in the clip,  as they're wheeling her gurney through the hospital.  She has a few comments to me.  I also have to know,  did the camera pan to her legs and the baby legs,  and you couldn't tell which was which?  Big fat dimpled knee.  The thing is, you could get pregnant if you're not careful.  And everyone knows you're not very careful.  I'm sure this Jesse guy is very nice,  but do you really want to have a baby?  I must. 
[02:37:30]  Babies are not dolls.  They're not puppies or kittens.  Babies get sick.  They need constant attention.  How would you manage that, Beth?  You can't even hook your own bra.  Do you really want to take that chance?  Do you want to have a baby?  Huck my own bra.  I make them without huck. 
[02:38:00]  Can't hook her own bra because she's too fat.  Big pig.  It has nothing to do with being retarded.  Then they show her getting her tubes tied.  Do we have that?  I don't know.  What track is that?  I don't think, I don't think.  You better have that gurney wheeling down that hallway.  I don't know if we do.  With her comments.  Let me try this.  There's a conversation about getting her tubes tied.  All right, let's hear that.  I don't know if this is, I don't know.  I'm going with kids.  That's what I say, because it's true. 
[02:38:30]  That's right, Beth.  And kids love you.  Yes.  I can't have any kids.  Beth.  That's true.  They had my tubes tied up.  Tied up.  But that's okay, because then I don't have to worry when I'm with Jesse.  You know what I mean?  Do you like marshmallows?  I love marshmallows.  Me too.  We got something in common.  The kind with the sugar on the top?  I haven't had those.  Yeah, I have them sometimes. 
[02:39:00]  They're holidays.  They make up for holidays.  Hi there, Jesse.  Jesse!  Jesse!  That's a good man!  That's my boyfriend, Jesse!  We know Beth, so shut up.  What did he say?  So shut up.  We know Beth, so shut up.  I don't know, Ann.  I think that's it.  Aw, they're wheeling her down the hospital hallway on the gurney, all ready to get her tubes tied.  And she starts moving around.  She goes, ah, I changed my mind!  I changed my mind!  I changed my mind!  And she's screaming, I changed my mind. 
[02:39:30]  Hey, keep wheeling her right through.  It's ain't your decision to make, stupid.  I don't care what the birth certificate says, mind of a six-year-old.  And they clip her anyway.  All right, then it's Beth and Rachel say goodbye, and then Beth back to riding the bus.  So everything's all...  Oh, it ends happy?  All nice.  Yeah, it ends the same way.  It ends, actually, with the clip that we played, um...  We played on Friday.  On Friday, so...  Ew!  We're done with this.  There was nothing to this.  This was a non-movie. 
[02:40:00]  Aside from her walking around sounding like Pee-wee retarded.  Oh, two just...  Ugh, imagine her and that black guy just going at it in bed.  But, you know what?  You gotta think, it's probably pretty cool for them.  It's just pure pleasure.  There's nothing rattling around in that head to distract you.  That genital mix, it probably smells like a Reuben.  Oh, God!  Unwashed fat dopes.  Ugh!  Why don't you lick it? 
[02:40:30]  All right, we gotta go to the phone real fast.  Dee Dee's checking in.  Remember Dee Dee from Washington?  She does the news for us every once in a while?  She was going on a hot date, Anthony, because her parents were in town for two weeks,  so she couldn't get any action.  Of course!  So she was setting herself up for a nice sex weekend.  Hello!  What's up, Dee Dee?  Hi, Bill!  Didn't that sound like that?  Wee-ah!  Yeah.  Wee-ah!  I told you I'd call in about my date for the weekend.  Yeah, so set us up.  So the parents were in town for two weeks, so you couldn't... 
[02:41:00]  For two long weeks.  Were you at least masturbating after they went to bed?  Because you're...  No, because I felt weird.  They're my parents.  They're in the other room.  I couldn't even release.  It was two weeks of not being able to release.  Because you're a horny one.  And I'm thinking even if your parents are staying with you, you've got to figure out  how to take care of yourself for a while there.  They're my parents.  All right, so they're in the other room.  I'm a good Catholic girl, kind of.  Were they banging?  I don't even want to know.  Oh, jeez.  All right. 
[02:41:30]  Well, so they finally left town.  Yeah, thank God.  Thursday.  And you had a hot weekend?  Mm-hmm.  It ended about midnight last night.  Oh.  When did it start?  What?  When did it start?  Friday.  Started Friday, ended last night.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  Who was tied up?  A little bit of both.  Really?  Yes.  Is this a co-worker?  No.  No?  This would be, you know, my delivery man. 
[02:42:00]  Jesse?  No.  Steve.  Wait, you're back to the UPS guy?  Yeah.  My UPS, Steve.  What's his name?  Steve.  Oh, okay.  Steve?  Steve.  I just want to tie you up and spank you.  I like to paddle your bottom.  So Steve came over Friday.  Friday evening, yes.  Friday evening.  Had some dinner, watched a movie, then.  Yeah, what'd you watch?  You were able to eat dinner and watch a movie before getting into some action?  Well, we had a little bit of action, too, beforehand. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  Did he wear his uniform?  No.  No?  Well, it doesn't work weekends, I guess.  No, no.  He's off on the weekend.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, walk us through this.  Come on.  Oh, God.  Well, what do you want to know?  Well, you guys did the dinner.  And what movie did you watch?  I don't even remember.  It was some lame-ass movie on TV.  Oh, my God.  You guys were having sex watching the movie, right?  Probably, yeah.  On the couch, yes.  Oh.  A little on the couch? 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  Did you tie him up?  Well, not until we got to the bedroom.  So what did you do on the couch?  We, you know, a little bit of foreplay stuff.  A little cunnilingus?  Oh, my God.  I'm not going to do it.  A cunnilingus and flesh show?  Did you do a little, uh...  Did you get a little of that cunnilingus?  A little flesh show?  Oh, lick, lick, lick.  Oh, my God.  Yeah?  Did you fillet him?  Dip his head down there.  Okay, stop.  Did he put his head down?  It sounded like he was eating a sloppy joe through a straw. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, my God.  Did you fillet him or what?  I can't...  Okay.  With a little...  A little bit.  Gave him a little gag?  Yes, sir.  I gave him a little gag.  Does he use little UPS euphemisms when you're having sex?  Like when he's going to come, does he say, get ready for Saturday delivery?  Oh, my God.  That would be fun.  Thank you for that idea, Norton.  Yeah.  All right.  So you go to the bedroom.  Now what?  Well, you know, I tied him up. 
[02:44:00]  You tied him up?  Yeah.  With what?  I have these, like, little, like, um, satin kind of, like, I don't know what you would call  them, like, rope sashes or whatever.  Were they made out of satin?  Yes, they're made out of satin.  Is he tied up?  Satin.  Is he tied up or could he get out at any given moment?  Well, he didn't, but I guess he could if he really wanted to try.  I don't get that whole tied up thing.  Just don't even get it. 
[02:44:30]  I didn't get it until I did it for the first time, and then I got it, and it was like,  whoa.  Ooh, I'm tied up.  Ooh.  It's a power trip for you.  I don't know what it is and why.  I don't like it all the time, but with certain people, it's okay.  So they made a cloth, these things?  Like, like, out of satin.  There's, like, a whole bunch of things you could use.  Wait, what are they made out of?  You like how it's satin.  Oh, okay.  Satin.  Satin.  Satin.  Satin.  I drive a satin.  A satin.  Satin. 
[02:45:00]  Satin.  Satin.  Sorry.  All right.  Guys getting tied up is so ridiculous because it's like, oh, you've tied me up.  Gee, don't fuck me.  You know?  It's like, if you tie a girl up, she could play off this fantasy like, ah, I don't want  to be fucked, and then all of a sudden you're banging her.  But a guy is like, with a huge rod, you're going to be laying there going, oh, please.  Oh, what are you going to do?  Oh, I hate that you've tied me up because now you can fuck me at will and I can't fight  you off.  It's ridiculous. 
[02:45:30]  You ever get tied up and have to hold your own restraints because you get out?  You slip right out of them.  Oh, I'm tied up.  Oh, please don't.  Oops.  Oh, geez.  It slipped out.  Okay.  Please don't use me as a toilet, you know.  I mean, you know, yeah.  Well, I'm tied up.  All right.  So he's tied up.  Now what?  Okay.  Do I have to go into all details?  Yes.  Are you naked at this point?  What?  Yeah.  Are you naked?  Well, yeah, we both are.  Are you going down on his rod?  I guess you could say that, yeah.  Did you strap one on, DeeDee?  What? 
[02:46:00]  You did?  No.  Come on.  See, that would be an answer to the tied up thing.  Because that would be like, oh, please don't, you know, oh, don't have sex with me.  Don't.  Okay, look.  We're not fucking around anymore.  Put that fucking thing away.  Untie me.  Untie me, bitch.  Green, green, green, green, green, green, green, green, green.  I didn't say green all weekend.  No.  No one said green all weekend, huh?  No.  Oh, look at you.  All right.  So what was the big moment for you?  You had him tied up.  What do you do to a guy when he's tied up? 
[02:46:30]  Oh, sometimes he likes a little bit of pain.  So, you know, nipple clamps, whatever.  Do you do any cockball torture?  I, no, no, no, no, I don't do that.  The twisting and mutilating?  No, not mutilating.  I guess just twisting.  The nipple clamps.  Now you're tied up and you've got the big rod happening.  Now you've got your nippy and nipple clamps.  That's awful.  Well, some people are, you know, into that.  Do you smother him at all, sit on his face?  Say that again, Norris. 
[02:47:00]  Do you smother him at all, sit on his face?  No.  What do you do?  Just put nipple clamps on him and go, huh?  Hey, how about that?  Look at you now.  Look what I do now.  Look what I do to you now.  All right, so you've got the nipple clamps on, then what?  That's what makes any of this ridiculous.  Because now you're sitting there like, yeah, you got me.  I got the nipple clamps.  And you've got to think the guy's just going, when are we just going to fuck?  We all do silly stuff in bed and you're just, I don't know.  You're so close the whole time just bursting out laughing. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  Because the whole act is ridiculous.  Because now you're, you're tied up his arms and his legs, he's got the rod and he's got  the nipple clamps on.  I'm laughing at this point if it's me.  I'm laughing.  I'm like, what are you doing?  You're like, this is silly.  This is really silly.  So what do you do next?  You just kind of pull on the nipple clamps.  Taser his yam bag.  And what does he do?  Scream for more?  Or does he have to, what, what?  Sometimes he'll scream for more.  Yeah.  And what are you saying?  You're a bad boy.  Yeah.  I'm going to fuck the FedEx guy. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  There's a five car pileup on the LIE.  That one, that one sounds like it hurt.  So what do you do?  So do you have a feather too or something?  Actually, I do.  And then I also have like a few lips.  You got a crop, a riding crop?  Are you cropping across his belly or something?  You know what?  Next time you're in town, I'll just bring the equipment in and you can look at it.  Good idea.  Hey, do you smack his penis with the riding crop a little?  A little bit, yeah.  You've done this before, haven't you, Norton? 
[02:48:30]  No, I'm just very familiar with it.  I'm not really a submissive, to be honest.  You're a dominant?  I don't know what I am.  I just don't want to be tied up.  You're a pervert.  Yeah, I'm just filthy.  John wants to know if you used the ball gag on him.  No.  Like the gimp?  No?  Okay.  Like the gimp?  No.  So, all right, he's got the nipple clamps, he's got the feather, you're pulling on the  nipple clamps a little bit.  What else?  Yeah, just a little bit of, like, you just talk kind of rough.  Like, what do you say?  I don't know.  I invited Zed over to fuck him in the ass.  I can't.  Yeah, give us some of the dialogue. 
[02:49:00]  No, I can't.  You've got to.  Give us some of the Dee Dee dialogue.  Here I am.  I'm tied up.  Ooh, I can't move, Dee Dee.  Ow!  Oh, those clips hurt.  Now what do you do?  Come on, Dee Dee.  Come on.  I'll just tell him to shut his whining.  Shut your fucking whining.  Whoa.  And then what do you do?  I can't do it.  Stop whining.  Yeah, what do you do now?  Stop whining.  Because I'm still whining.  I'm hoo.  I can't.  How do you say stop your whining?  I say stop your fucking whining.  Stop whining.  Really?  Stop whining.  Shut up! 
[02:49:30]  Shut up!  Stop it!  And then he gets fake scared, right?  Well, he acts like he's really scared.  Quiet.  You think he's faking it?  And then that gives you a little power, right?  And it gets you even more moist.  Now we're having fun.  Oh, my God.  Stop whining.  And then do you climb aboard?  I guess you could say that, yeah.  Climb aboard.  All aboard!  All aboard, everybody!  All aboard!  And then eventually you let him go and he just has his way with you, right?  Hello?  Uh-oh.  Did the phones crap out again? 
[02:50:00]  Danny?  What happened?  Sit down, Danny.  She would never hang up.  No, the whole phone line went click.  Everything just...  Something's wrong with the phones today.  They keep petering out.  What's Danny doing in there?  They keep Danny-ing out.  What are you doing in there, Danny?  He's looking through...  He's looking into a notebook or something.  Oh, my God.  This is going to be a...  What did that thing do?  This is going to be a cliffhanger.  Yeah.  Ooh.  I want to know what she does.  You think she does that? 
[02:50:30]  Just climbs on board?  There's got to be a point where the guy is like, enough of this.  That's what I mean.  Enough.  And then she's reading the guy, then all of a sudden she lets him go, and then he's so  crazy, he just has his way with her.  Yeah.  And that's the turn on.  That's what I'm thinking.  You'd be surprised.  A lot of these submissives...  And I don't understand fetish without sex.  I have to get off.  But a lot of guys, man, they don't need to whack their bags.  I've talked to Dom.  They said that the guy won't even whack his bag.  He thinks it's disrespectful.  Really?  A lot of guys just want the fetish.  They want the beating or the showers.  And they don't want to actually get off. 
[02:51:00]  It's insanity.  It's crazy.  It's crazy.  It's nuts.  I don't get it.  It's insane.  I don't get it.  No.  All right.  Well, frankly, I don't get the whole time.  If D.D. calls back, we'll find out how it ended, okay?  I don't get that.  The handcuffs.  It's like, oh, they got handcuffs.  Look out.  Well, they can tease you.  That's what they do.  They'll probably get you closer, tease you a little bit, make you want it, and then you  have no control.  This thing has been the whole time leading up to the point where you're in the bedroom. 
[02:51:30]  That's the teasing.  Have you ever used the candy panties?  Candy panties.  They're like cherry flared, and they make the girl look like she's wearing a diaper.  And it's a big nasty.  They're never tight or sexy, because they're made for fat people, too.  It's like one size fruit roll-up panty fits all.  By the time you tie them on her, she's so worked up, the whole damn thing's melting all  over the place.  It smells bad.  They've got to make those things taste like rye and mayo.  They just look ridiculous. 
[02:52:00]  That's what I want.  A fruit roll-up with pubes in them.  Right.  Let me eat.  Mmm.  Edible.  They just look ridiculous.  All right.  Well.  Flystrip.  We're waiting for Dee Dee to call back.  I don't think she's going to call back.  I think she's got traffic to do.  I have traffic to do.  That could be her right now.  Yeah?  All right.  Good call, Hawk.  Well, you're on the ball today, Eric.  I'll say.  You are.  This kid's good.  Maybe he's calling her.  Did she put a block of wood next to his ankles and smash it with a sledgehammer? 
[02:52:30]  There you go.  Or if you're true to the book, in the book, she didn't hit him with a sledgehammer.  Yeah, I know this.  Go.  She chops his foot off with a hatchet in misery and then blowtorches the wound so it  can't bleed.  That's fantastic.  Stephen King has genius.  That is fantastic.  Yeah.  If they did that in the movie, they can't have the cute ending where he's walking around  New York as a successful author again.  Yeah.  He's kind of limpy.  That's about it.  All right.  We can't get Dee Dee, I guess.  Oh, shoot.  We're going to have to blow that off. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  That's the beauty of the show, though.  There's all sorts of storylines zing, zing, zinging all over the place.  Pew!  Pew!  Pew!  Pew!  Pew!  And eventually we'll get to the end of that storyline, okay?  Roy.  When we get back, finally, I apologize to Andy Gore.  He's been waiting out there with two very, very fine women.  Yeah.  Andy Gore's in town to take back the pickled punk, Anthony.  Thank goodness.  So we're going to do that.  We also have all the Laura Bush stand-up stuff.  She's a wild one.  She's a wild one.  Pretty funny, making fun of her hubby, the president. 
[02:53:30]  She's a card.  Jimmy gives her thumb up.  Yeah.  And she had that one line, George owes me money for the budget, and he's dodging me.  We've got lots more show to do, so quick break, and we'll continue.  We'll see you.  State of the Union.  Gas prices going up again.  The Opiate Anthony Show on XM. 
[02:54:00]  Oh!  Who goes the weasel?  Ramone.  Give me your sleeve.  All right, we've got lots to do still.  Let's get Andy Gore in here as we go back to the phone and talk to DeeDee.  DeeDee's back, everyone.  All right, DeeDee.  Hey, I only have, like, a few seconds.  You left us with a cliffhanger, so what happens? 
[02:54:30]  You're teasing him.  You've got the feather.  He's got the nipple clamps.  He's tied up.  Then what happens at the end?  Oh, what do you think happens?  Use your imagination.  But do you let him go, and then he has his way with you, or do you just ride him that way?  For a while, yeah, sure.  I do that.  I can't.  Then you untie him, and are you then a little submissive?  Yeah, and then I'm the submissive one.  You're on the bottom?  A little bit of roller plane.  Bottom top or both?  What do you like?  A little bit of both. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Did he spank you?  Of course he did.  All right, this is the fast round.  Come on, guys.  She only has like 30 seconds.  Okay, you know what?  How many times did you come?  Let's just say we were both very happy numerous times.  Numerous times, okay.  Come on, I had my whole weekend here.  What does he say to you when he spanks you?  Yeah, what does he say to you when he spanks you?  You bad girl, you.  Yeah, you like that.  You like that.  Well, we use the F word a lot.  You tell me about all the cock you suck when I'm not here, you bad girl. 
[02:55:30]  Hold on.  Keep talking, Opie.  Yeah, Opie.  Yeah.  You'd be good at that.  You go pass out and marry some English counterfeiter.  Yeah, you bad girl.  Actually, never mind.  That counterfeiter is an asshole.  Well, what else?  Come on, Deedee.  What does he say to you, sweetie?  Yeah, what does he say to you?  He might be with me. 
[02:56:00]  Good.  This is going to hurt me more than it hurts you.  Yeah.  I told you to do better in your studies.  Yeah, do you role play?  Do you make believe you're a little girl or anything like that with him?  Sometimes I am a little girl, yeah.  Well, with the voice, you know.  How old?  He has a voice.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How old?  High school, college.  What a rookie.  Can you play one?  You want me to be a little girl?  All right, so you're like a high school girl or a college girl, and what is he?  Okay, he likes me to say, I've been bad, Daddy. 
[02:56:30]  No.  I knew we'd get to that.  Okay, I got to go.  How do you say it, Deedee?  You don't say it.  How do you say it?  I've been bad, Daddy.  I can't say it.  I got it out.  You got me to say that much.  So he spanks you, and you say, I've been bad, Daddy?  I've been very bad, Daddy.  And then you look down, and he's throbbing at that point.  But I don't snort.  You can barely get Daddy out before he just goes, oh!  So when he spanks you, do you say, like, I've been bad, Daddy, I'm the sheriff? 
[02:57:00]  No!  Okay, you know what?  Next time when you guys are in town, I will bring some stuff in.  I've been bad, Daddy, huh?  I've been bad.  Very bad.  Like what?  What have you done?  I didn't say it.  No, no.  And then he goes, well, why are you bad?  You know, I have to go do a report.  Daughter?  Yeah.  I have to go do a report.  Whenever you're having age play, you tell her that she's your special girl.  What?  You're my special girl. 
[02:57:30]  That's what you do when you're having Daddy, daughter age play.  Oh, really, Jimmy?  Yeah.  You know that?  My special girl, sure.  You're my special girl.  That's right.  Could you put on a little pink tango hat?  Go missing?  I have to go do a report.  No?  All right, Dee Dee.  Dee Dee's got to do some traffic, everyone.  Sorry.  All right, Dee Dee.  Oh, someone called for.  It's so uncalled for.  And go missing?  Oh, yeah.  I've been getting emails from some of your listeners. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, you have?  And go missing?  Yeah, they're a cordial bunch.  And?  Oh, they just want to know if I snort while I have an orgasm.  Oh.  Yeah, do you?  No.  No?  Well, maybe if he cracks a joke in the middle of it, you'll.  So, Daddy spanked you, does he?  Yes, he does.  I've been bad.  Does he put it in while he spanks you?  Well, what do you think?  Yes.  I don't know.  It depends.  A lot of people would separate those things.  And then you start yelling that you're going to be good from now on?  That type of thing? 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  I've got to go.  No, you don't.  No.  Yeah, I do.  I have to go do a Chicago, Dallas, and Minnie.  Yeah.  Tell them you've been bad, too.  I've been bad, Minneapolis.  Yeah, you should shock the hell out of the people that are stupid enough to listen to  those dumb traffic stations.  Traffic is so bad.  Right.  You want an audience on the traffic stations.  It's on to something.  Traffic's naughty.  It's so bad.  Traffic is bad, Daddy.  Traffic is bad.  It's all backed up. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah.  Don't go through that tunnel.  It's wet and slippery.  Oh, my God.  No.  All right.  Well, you guys have a good day.  All right.  I'm going to do traffic.  All right.  She's going to do traffic.  Bye, DeeDee.  But next time you're in town, I'll bring some stuff in.  Yeah, bring your toys.  Give me a notice.  DeeDee, you've been so bad.  I've been very bad.  Very.  Very bad.  I've been very bad.  Sachin.  I've been very bad with Sachin.  Sachin.  Sachin.  Sachin.  Sachin. 
[02:59:30]  Sachin.  Thank you, Perfect Diction.  Go do traffic.  Hey, Norton.  Okay, bye.  Bye.  That's sick.  Bye.  That's sick.  Sachin.  There's so much more to her.  Yeah.  She's a filthy girl.  We're just scratching the surface there.  Old friend in studio, guys.  Andy Gore.  I'm sorry to make you wait, Andy.  Hey, no problem.  We haven't even really taken any breaks today on this show.  It's very strange.  We've only taken two breaks for some reason.  Just nonstop banter.  Banter.  Goofy banter.  Good fun banter.  You're in town for something? 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, I just got done doing the Chiller Theater.  Yes.  Or TV Expo.  Who was there?  I love hearing the list of celebrities that show up.  Ah.  Regulars.  Lou Ferrigno was there.  Lou Ferrigno.  The Incredible Hulk.  Horse.  Stepped on my toe.  Did he?  Yeah, by accident.  Probably heard.  Make a good story, though.  You yelled, ow, when you didn't hear us?  Didn't hear, huh?  Wow.  He blew off our show.  We were supposed to interview him.  Yeah, from New Orleans, I think.  We have a brilliant booker that's helping out this program. 
[03:00:30]  They book an interview with Lou Ferrigno while we're at Mardi Gras, the loudest place on  earth.  We can't even hear ourselves think, and we're going to interview a guy that has problems  hearing.  That's deaf.  Yeah.  So, he never called, so we never had to go through that hell.  Who else is over there?  They had...  Linda Blair?  Nah, she wasn't there this time.  They had Tanya Harding was there.  Tanya Harding?  Tanya Harding was there, yeah.  For what?  She's a...  Basically, I think this brought her in as like an oddity. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, most of it is like for horror movie stuff.  Yeah, you know...  But they bring in these...  They bring in like some fringe actors from like, you know, Conrad Brooks from Plan 9,  this obscure little film from the 50s.  Yeah, of course.  You know, he's milking his nine lines.  Yeah, they get like women...  I saw a couple of women that were in, like as a peripheral character in a Twilight Zone  episode, and they show up and they're signing things.  What horror film has Tanya Harding done besides Jeff Galooly chasing her with that monster 
[03:01:30]  cock?  Those cone titties.  She ballooned up.  She's getting a little big, huh?  I didn't even get to see her.  I was so busy up in the booth.  I didn't get down.  She's doing some of that boxing now.  But she was there.  I got to sign you.  People are going to smack you in the head.  Oh, baby.  Trying to get the last bit of goodness.  Yeah, everyone knows that you're trying to get the last bit of goodness.  I read it on instant feedback.  Every time you eat. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, I knock it off.  But when you guys eat, it's not a problem?  There you go.  Jim starts every show with a mouthful of food.  I can't help it.  I'm hungry.  And I get nervous.  I get scared.  Oh, God damn it.  You're going to...  You always...  You never travel alone.  That's why I like you.  No.  Yes.  Now, who are the lovely ladies?  Lovely ladies.  I recognize one girl from last time.  This is Katie Ketchup.  Hello.  Katie Ketchup.  Katie Ketchup.  She has a ketchup fetish.  Really?  Yeah.  What?  Yeah, she's all about her ketchup.  Look, she's got ketchup tattoos. 
[03:02:30]  Hold on.  Andy, we love you, buddy.  That's pretty cool, yeah.  Give her a mic.  You've got to step up to a mic.  She's got to...  I mean, her name's Katie Ketchup, and she has a ketchup fetish.  I'm like, eh, whatever.  But then she shows us the...  She's got a lot of work on her arms, tattoos and stuff, and she's got a tattoo of a ketchup bottle.  Yeah.  Yeah, I put ketchup on almost everything, and so I've got a ketchup bottle right there, and  it has the rays that are around the Virgin of Guadalupe.  Right.  Right. 
[03:03:00]  So that is like your Virgin of Guadalupe.  Yeah, it's my sacred bottle of ketchup.  You're an odd bird.  That is something.  Thank you.  You're way too hot to have a ketchup fetish.  I like that, though.  Is there anything you wouldn't put ketchup on?  Yeah.  Like?  Yeah.  Chocolate.  Chocolate.  Chocolate.  Ice cream.  Yeah.  What would you think is the oddest thing you've put ketchup on?  Chicken.  Chicken.  Chicken.  That's not that crazy, though.  It's almost like a barbecue sauce type thing, but it's not normal. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah, most people wouldn't do that.  Macaroni and cheese.  It's not an actual fetish.  It's just like an obsession.  It's an obsession.  It's an obsession.  Somebody went out and got her a hamburger the other day and came back, and she was like,  did you get ketchup?  And they had like six little things of it.  She was like, that's not enough.  And she ran downstairs to the restaurant and got a tub of it.  You really drenched it in ketchup?  I mean, it was like a big...  Why ketchup?  It's almost like an OCD to tweet. 
[03:04:00]  I mean, we all love ketchup.  I do.  I'll say it.  Yeah, sure.  So, if you have a burger, how many of those little packets do you need?  It depends on the size of the burger, but usually I need at least six.  Six?  Mm-hmm.  Just so it's running out the sides and everything.  Six isn't a lot.  Well, I put it in a pile, and then I dip the burger in.  Because I don't like it getting all over my clothes.  I'm all about the dip.  Right.  Because it starts crawling down your arms and stuff.  Yeah, that makes perfect sense.  I'm a dipper with my burgers now.  After two bites, your arm looks like the inside of a boat in Modesto. 
[03:04:30]  Yes, it does.  Catch-up fetish.  I've never heard of that before.  Catch-up freak.  It's awesome.  At some point, she's got the tattoo.  That's a commitment to catch-up, once you start tattooing yourself with them.  And there's another lovely gal over there who I didn't meet last time.  Not that I'm hitting on her, of course.  Oh, no.  Unless she's got low self-esteem, then I am.  No, come on up.  This is Donald Jim Kim.  She works for me.  And she loves mustard. 
[03:05:00]  Yes, she does.  Wouldn't that be a weird little twist in this whole thing?  They can battle it out.  How do you feel about mustard?  How do I feel about mustard?  No.  Me?  Yeah.  I like it sometimes.  Yeah?  But not like ketchup?  Nah, nah.  Just a little bit here and there.  All right.  Mayonnaise?  I don't really care for mayonnaise.  Yeah.  Barbecue sauce?  Yes, I like barbecue sauce.  Yeah, it's close to ketchup, right?  That's fine.  I hear you.  You like tomatoes?  Yes.  Yeah.  It's a whole tomato.  Green ketchup?  Uh, no.  That's odd.  Purple?  No. 
[03:05:30]  What's your favorite ketchup?  I'm a big Heinz 57.  I'm not a big fan of Hunts.  I like Heinz.  I would think if she tattooed Heinz on me.  Oh, I didn't notice.  Yeah.  I don't like the Hunts.  It annoys me.  It doesn't taste like good ketchup.  That's just trying to sound like Heinz.  What's that?  Hunts was like trying to sound like Heinz, I think.  Yeah.  Like, get me some Heinz ketchup.  I think I said Hunts.  Hunts.  Yeah.  You're such a hunt.  Very good.  I don't get it.  And, uh, well, we haven't met you.  Wait, Miss, don't be shy.  Jungle Jim Kim.  Hi, Jungle Jim. 
[03:06:00]  Jungle Jim Kim.  I met this lovely young girl at a horror convention.  Horror.  Horror.  Horror.  Horror.  You got my hopes up there.  Man, I know.  No, no, no.  In, uh, in Baltimore.  Yeah, about three years ago.  Baltimore.  Baltimore.  Baltimore, hun.  And I was just like, wanted to screw herself.  No.  Wow.  Yeah, I just thought she was really cute and I talked to her.  And, uh.  Dude, you got some hot women that, uh, travel around.  Damn.  They just come.  How tall are you?  How tall am I? 
[03:06:30]  I don't know.  Five, six, five, seven.  Five, six, five, seven.  Yeah.  Brown hair.  Very sexy.  Very sexy.  A lovely gal.  Thank you.  I think Andy Gore is a huge hog.  This is really bugging me.  You think he keeps giving a jar of formaldehyde?  Oh, yes, I do.  As to his bed.  Do you get to have, do you get to have sex with these ladies?  Uh, no.  I keep it on a professional level.  There you go.  That's going to be tough, right?  Yeah.  It must, uh.  It's difficult, but the problems with these girls are just that they're smart.  And they're really good workers.  Oh, boy. 
[03:07:00]  And they work their ass off.  Then we better not talk to them anymore.  Yeah.  Because we have really bad interviews with intelligent women.  We'll fold up.  Yes.  I mean, they're good workers.  They must really draw in the people to the booth.  They draw in the people.  They don't slack.  I mean, I don't drive because I'm a fucking gimp.  And they do all the driving and just work, you know, 15-hour days with me and dress up  and wear high heels and kill their feet all day long.  Yeah, very sexy outfits.  Yeah, and it's just, you know, they're just a whole part of the show, of my show.  We'll get some images up on opianthony.com later today. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah.  So, Andy, what else is going on with you?  Nothing.  Just that, you know, chiller theater show where I set up, you know, the same side show and  sold a bunch of, you know, crap I made.  You're okay with being away from home?  Yeah, well, this is my job, basically, you know.  Like, I'm touring, basically.  That's what I look at when I go to your shows.  Right on.  So, it doesn't freak you out or nothing?  No.  You know, it's kind of, it's a pain in the ass and hotel beds and fucking.  For the new listeners, Andy's got some serious OCD issues as well. 
[03:08:00]  Way OCD.  Hey, do you get one room together?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yep.  So, you get to see them walking around after they get out of the shower and stuff?  Yeah.  A little peek here and there?  A little peek.  Oops, I didn't know you were still in there.  A little peek.  Good life.  That's a great life.  I'm, you know, chasing them around.  Your girls catch them jacking a little bit, maybe, in the night.  You hear.  You get that going.  The special ones will get the naked dance.  They will get the Andy Gordon naked dance. 
[03:08:30]  Really?  Which is frightening with my Auschwitz chic physique.  You do the naked dance for them?  Unfortunately.  Yeah.  I have not seen the naked dance yet.  Not cool.  Apparently, I'm going to be seeing that too.  She needs to earn the naked dance.  Well, Ketchup Lady, what's the naked dance all about?  It's skinny and scary and...  Does he have a big hog?  It's huge.  Okay, yeah.  Is it really?  It's massive.  I was right.  Does he flap it around when he dances?  No, it's like a third leg. 
[03:09:00]  Does he tuck it and go, oh?  Would you?  I come out doing the man giant and then just let it pop out like a turtle head.  There you go.  Turn around and show the fruit bowl.  Yeah.  We got Adam from PA on the line.  He's got a good question.  Adam, go ahead.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Hey, I wanted to ask Katie, have you ever put ketchup on a hot dog and have it scream at you?  Have you ever put ketchup on a hot dog and have it scream at you?  The hot dog.  They'll tend to do that if you're maybe taking acid or it's 1967. 
[03:09:30]  No, it was there.  Everything's been cool so far.  Yeah.  Cool.  Yeah, maybe you have to put some relish and, man, mustard on it.  Ugh.  That woman.  We got to play that one of these days.  Yeah, we can play that again.  The last time we played that.  I love that thing.  All right.  So you brought some stuff, Andy?  I know you brought something that was creeping some of the guys out.  Oh, he's having a headphone problem.  Uh-oh.  Maybe the naked dance.  All right, calm down, man.  You're going now.  Okay.  But the beauty of these girls, too, is if, like, one happens to get pregnant, you can  just point at the jar and go, well, you know. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah, another exhibit.  Yeah, keep a baseball bat around.  Wow.  Every girl who gets pregnant, his inventory goes up.  Yeah.  That's great.  It's an abortion.  We can write that off.  I just want some stuff to give to Jim.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, look at that.  It's a little nut sack.  You gave me that one already.  Elephant.  I know.  Yeah, a couple years ago.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I'm repeating myself.  Wait, explain it, Andy.  It's the radio.  It's a pillow.  It's a pillow.  Two-foot-tall pillow.  A gentleman with elephantiasis of the balls.  He looks like he's, what is it called, a hoppity-hop or a hippity-hop? 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, totally, yeah.  Whatever they're called.  It looks like he's sitting on one of those.  Yeah, like a producer for the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  But upside down.  Where did his schlong go?  What happens is that all this is lymph.  It's the clear stuff in your blood.  It inflames the scrotum and the penis resides, recedes up into it.  And it could stretch out that big?  It could stretch out that big.  Ow!  It's as big as one of those workout balls, you see.  Yeah, it's huge. 
[03:11:00]  It's sitting on it.  It's a parasite that crawls in their wing when they're in the tropics.  I'm getting that horrible, tingly feeling down there.  The blood all rushes to it?  Yeah.  Oh, not that one.  We'll put that in our office.  Oh, yeah, totally.  It's called the layback on the sack.  All right.  Layback on the sack.  Very good.  That's nice.  Oh, yeah.  This is what Katie wants to give Norton.  What is it?  It's from Kim and I.  Oh, from the girls.  From the girls.  Nice.  Woo! 
[03:11:30]  It's what I just made to go with this up.  Oh, it's a coffee mug?  Ooh!  Ah!  How beautiful is that?  Who is it?  Ed Gain.  My first name?  Ed Gain, yeah.  Oh, that's fantastic.  He's a good one.  It has a picture of him in his red hat, which I love the color in the red hat.  And it's got a beautiful upside-down nude torso, which is sliced from crotch to back.  And the little head seems to be missing.  Oh, turn that around.  Let me see.  Look at that. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  Wow, that is really sick.  There was an interview I read about Ed Gain, and they said, they asked him,  what do you think when you see a pretty girl?  I think it was Ed Gain.  And he said, I wonder what it would be like to go on a date with them.  And they said, well, what else do you think?  He goes, I think, wonder what their head would look like on a stick.  That was the process of what he thought.  That's it.  Go on a date, head on a stick.  You've got to respect that.  You've got to.  This is fantastic.  Thank you.  I love it.  Yeah, sure.  Beautiful.  Oh, I love it.  So I've just been keeping busy making a bunch of new stuff. 
[03:12:30]  Are you taking back my pickled punk, please?  Yeah, that is pretty much.  Okay, yeah.  You know, well, we love having you on and stuff.  And obviously, you're here for the duration, I guess.  But there is some business we must tend to do.  There is some business.  Yes.  You had given Opie a pickled punk a couple of years back.  Genuine carnival pickled punk.  Yeah.  How old was that thing?  We were trying to figure it out.  We were trying to.  Probably from the, like, 50s or 60s.  It came out of Captain Harvey Boswell's Palace of Wonders. 
[03:13:00]  What happened to Captain Harvey?  Captain Harvey recently, probably died about three or four years ago.  Yeah.  And I obtained his collection.  You obtained the collection.  Yes.  And then Opie was fascinated with these things.  Did he live a good life?  And was he old and stuff, hopefully?  He was old and cranky.  All right, good.  Yeah.  You know, just old carny.  And I got lucky and ended up getting the bulk of his collection.  Mm-hmm.  Well, Opie got this pickled punk. 
[03:13:30]  And I don't know.  It's just a bad vibe around it.  This thing has this negative vibe.  We really don't like it.  Yeah, where is it?  It's scary.  Please.  And we figured the only...  I'm not touching it.  The only way...  I already gave up on it.  The only way we can cleanse ourselves of this is to just give it back to the person who it came from.  Don't drop it.  Don't unwrap it.  Oh, let me see the little fella.  Yeah.  Oof.  Is it like you're meeting... 
[03:14:00]  You're seeing somebody after a long time?  Like my old friend?  Oh.  It's just a baby.  Oh, they're saying...  Look at that.  The hot chicks love the pickled punk.  I forgot how good that one was.  It's a really nice one.  With the missing foot, too.  There's a missing foot?  I think one of the feeder is missing.  Oh.  Perhaps he's a novelist that went driving around.  He's a little contortionist in that little jar.  Here, Andy. 
[03:14:30]  Feetless.  Feetless.  I'm officially handing it back.  Here it is.  And Katie takes it.  Uh-oh.  I think...  No, no.  Give it back to Opie.  You have to hand it directly to...  What are you doing, Opie?  I believe...  I'm with Anthony.  You have to hand it directly back to Andy.  First, you've got to take a sip out of there.  Shots.  Here you go, Andy.  There it is.  That's the transfer.  There you go.  There it is.  With no ritual or any of that.  I've written it.  People suggested.  The pickled punk is now back where it belongs. 
[03:15:00]  He will rejoin his friends at Andy's.  Yes, he will be with all of his other pickled...  God, that's a good one.  Brothers and sisters.  That's a great one.  Yeah.  I've got to tell you.  The jar has been opened and someone did tap the top of his head.  I did hear that and whoever did that, it's amazing.  It is amazing.  Amazingly sick.  Ugh.  Lunatic.  Look at that.  That's awesome.  Anyway, I'm fascinated by these things.  I'm digging it.  See?  Now it's appreciated.  Now it feels appreciated again.  I sleep around like 30 of these things.  I know. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  I saw your place, man.  But the big ones.  The display and the lights and the fish tanks and the diapers.  It's all amazing, Andy.  I've got to tell you.  Next time you guys are in town in D.C.  I mean, D.C. sucks, but whenever you're back there, you guys have to come by.  You guys really have to come by.  I would like to see it.  You've got to go by his apartment.  It'll be the whole show the next morning.  There's so much going on in his apartment.  That's good.  There's a lot more.  You guys can tell me how it was.  You've got to go, Anthony.  Come on, Anthony.  I want to come over.  You wouldn't go at all?  No.  I don't think so.  The Siamese twins in a fish tank with diapers on them? 
[03:16:00]  Tell me about it.  With the cleft lip?  The cleft lip.  Lion Boy.  You get to see Lion Boy.  Waterhead Seal Boy.  Seal Boy.  Waterhead Seal Boy, huh?  Yeah.  It has a worm body with little flippers and an alien head, and it was autopsyed on the  back of his head with these big Frankenstein stitches.  I mean, it looks like an alien.  Wow.  It's in this old medical jar with old locks and stuff.  With old locks that the carnies would lock it down so nobody would steal it.  Yeah.  And chains. 
[03:16:30]  It's just vintage, and it's pure carnival stuff.  It's wonderful.  Yeah.  And this guy, man, he knows how to do it right.  He's got the whole display of pickle punks that starts off all nice and normal, and then  the grand finale, and he has, like, what, like, drapes or whatever on each tank?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some kind of thing.  Yeah.  That covers up, and then he does the big reveal, and here's this one.  You're like, ooh.  Yeah.  And by the end, you're just horrified.  They get just scarier and scarier.  Yeah.  And he has the lights, you know, coming up from the bottom of some of the tanks. 
[03:17:00]  Good presentation.  Oh, yeah.  So the lights are reflecting all over the place, making it look even creepier.  Hey, you guys have fun.  You can tell me about it.  You should come.  I'll snap you.  You know, snap some pictures.  No?  I'll take a look-see.  Don't you have another pickle punk here today?  Yeah.  Well, I brought one to give you.  Yeah.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Now, this one...  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  This one was made...  Oh, Jesus.  I hope that's in a jar of honey, man.  This is what's known... 
[03:17:30]  It's not a...  A bouncer is a pickle punk that's made of rubber.  That's a lot of the older carnivals, because they couldn't get the real ones, so they would  just make casts off the real ones.  So this is...  It's not a bouncer.  It's a pseudo-bouncer.  It's made of resins.  It was made by a friend of mine who used to work for a very famous toy company who just  quit.  Oh, so that is not real.  No.  This is not real, and I'll eventually be there in, like, beginning of production right now. 
[03:18:00]  I just have to get better jars for them and make a banner line.  What was used as a mold?  It was just sculpted.  It was sculpted from photographs, yeah.  The Peterson boy.  Looks like Rosie O'Donnell from The Leg.  Yeah, nice.  So, if you can deal with this one...  Well, I don't know.  Oh, is that going to get...  Let me see.  Let me see.  No, if it's fake, even I'm fine with that.  Oh, yeah.  It's resin.  As long as it's fake.  We don't open it.  What if he's just saying it's fake?  Yeah, you can't open it. 
[03:18:30]  What is it in?  What kind of liquid?  I just think it's in...  What did he put?  I think he put in some kind of pickle juice and water, but he didn't use distilled water,  so it smells really bad.  Let me take a look-see.  All right.  I mean, if you shake it, you can hear clunk.  Yeah, it's heavy.  Yeah, you can tell it's not real.  How can you tell?  Because it looks like it's modeled.  You're not tricking us, are you?  No, no. 
[03:19:00]  I wouldn't do that.  All right.  It looks sculpted.  You can tell.  Does it?  Yeah.  Let me take a look.  Take a look.  All right.  I don't touch the jar.  I don't touch the jar either.  No, I mean...  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, he rolls the jar.  Look.  You could tell.  Yeah, you could tell.  I mean, if you just compared the two.  Turn it around.  You could tell.  That's fetus ass, isn't it?  And I've seen my share of fetus ass, and...  That's some hot fetus ass.  That ain't it.  All right.  What we'll do is we'll...  Yeah, we'll keep that one. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah, you can deal with that one.  You know.  It's like having an action figure around.  It's all it is, I fear.  That's all it is.  That's fine.  All right.  Andy, hang out.  We just got to get through a couple other things here.  I got to take a lope.  You really do, huh?  Again?  Dude, I pee a lot.  I get scared.  You're scared.  You're nervous.  All right.  You know what?  Just really fast.  Listen to this.  Listen to this.  Listen to this.  Coming up at 10.  You think Homer Bush is funny?  Well, wait till you see how Laura Bush had all of Washington in stitches.  And keep that umbrella handy. 
[03:20:00]  The forecast at 10.  He said Homer Bush.  Wait a minute.  Did he mean Laura Bush?  Is that what happened?  No, no, no.  He was saying Homer Simpson.  Homer.  Oh, you think Homer Simpson is funny?  Wait till you see.  What a douchebag.  I got to hear that again.  This is the Fox 5 News.  What an idiot.  And they're on after the Simpsons, you know, later on in the night.  Where's Homer Bush?  Homer Bush.  Why don't you do it, Billy?  So, obviously, the news people, you got to think they're watching the Simpsons.  Uh-huh.  They've got time to kill. 
[03:20:30]  Yep.  So, he's got that on his mind.  And he's supposed to say Homer Simpson.  If you think Homer Simpson's funny, wait till you hear what Laura Bush has to say.  But he screwed it all up.  Coming up at 10.  You think Homer Bush is funny?  Well, wait till you see how Laura Bush had all of Washington in stitches.  And keep that umbrella handy.  The forecast at 10.  Homer Bush.  Homer Bush.  The president.  That guy is the biggest hack, by the way, in New York News.  Who was he?  He was the guy that stood outside for, like, hours upon hours and interviewed us after we 
[03:21:00]  did the Sex with Sam thing and we got fired and we were leaving the office finally.  Yeah.  And I said something like, we'll be back.  And then he made a huge story about it on his newscast saying that he got an exclusive  interview with Opie from the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll be back.  Fucked up.  That's all I said.  Because he goes, do you have a comment?  I'm like, we'll be back.  Good comment, Opie, two years later.  He's a, yeah, exactly.  We'll be back.  He's a hack.  He's a big time hack.  Um, and really fast, I want to play this before we go to break. 
[03:21:30]  Christy, what's your lighthearted take on our recent bad weather?  Sorry, Kent.  I sold all my bad weather jokes to Jay Moore.  But I can make funny sounds in your microphone.  Fine.  There you have it.  That was a clip from the Robert Kelly CD.  That's great.  Look at Jay Moore.  A lot of people have joked over the years that Jay takes and steals jokes and buys jokes 
[03:22:00]  and all that and then made The Simpsons.  That's very funny.  Kind of neat, right?  All right, when we get back, we'll play the Laura Bush stuff.  So, Jimmy can take a quick leak.  I have to take a lope.  All right, and Andy Gore's in studio.  Anything else you got, Andy?  Oh, yeah, I got a few other things.  Just gave Norton some shirts.  Fantastic shirts, by the way.  It says, my daddy touches me, and in parentheses, but don't tell mommy.  And it's in a beautiful Walt Disney typeface.  Oh, let me see.  Look at that.  Yeah, it is.  It's like that Walt Disney fun. 
[03:22:30]  And then I also gave him a youth size, you know, just in case.  I'll put one on the little kids.  Little fellas.  They're cute shirts and all, but do people actually walk around wearing them, you think?  You've seen them?  I'd walk around wearing them for that.  I'd like to see that.  Oh, my God.  Make sure she, you know, puts the shirt on.  We'll get a picture of that for foundrymusic.com and opiator.com.  I have one of the most offensive shirts ever on my desk.  I can't even say it.  I can't even bring it home or nothing.  What's it say?  Someone sent it in?  Could you go grab it? 
[03:23:00]  Go grab it, Hawk.  Yeah, someone sent it to me.  I think it's from T-Shirt Hell.  Yeah, they put out T-shirts.  You ever see that site?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  And there it is.  Wow.  That is a classic.  That is a classic.  Yeah.  It's a picture of Adolf Hitler.  Look, you're a reporter now, man.  I know.  I'm just commenting what the time is T-Shirt.  This is what someone sent us.  It's a T-Shirt, a picture of Adolf Hitler, and in big letters it says, 
[03:23:30]  Love him or hate him, Hitler killed a ton of Jews.  Who would walk around with that?  Who actually would walk around wearing that shirt?  I got it in the mail here at the studio.  It has not left the studio.  I don't even want to throw it away because if someone goes through the garbage and sees that,  yeah, I'm going to have to burn it.  I made one Hitler shirt in my day.  It was Hitler, like a picture of him, and he had a milk mustache, and it said,  Habib Milch at the bottom, but she's got milk. 
[03:24:00]  Of course.  And I just thought it was hilarious.  Well, it just causes too much of an uproar.  Go figure.  Go figure.  That's the whole Hitler thing.  Just poking a little fun, you know?  Strikes a nerve.  Yeah, when you wipe out half of Europe, you know, they tend to get sensitive.  Touchy.  It's a little parody, you know?  All right.  You need a link.  Hey, thanks for my smoothie there, Travis.  Thanks for asking.  The boss wanted a smoothie.  That was a good one.  I didn't get you a smoothie.  I'm sorry.  The boss wanted a smoothie. 
[03:24:30]  That's fresh squeezed.  Did that come from the place that does make the smoothies?  Then does it matter if it was a smoothie or not?  I wasn't planning on going there.  He's giving me a hard fucking time.  Holy shit.  Wow, Travis.  I thought he would go, I'm sorry, I'll go and get you a smoothie, but now you're going  to spit in it.  Yeah.  I don't want your smoothie now.  No, I don't want a smoothie.  That's all.  Thank you, Travis.  If you want one, you'll let me.  All right.  I will let you know, Travis.  Wait a minute.  Do you really have to take a break?  You guys do.  I'll run out.  Why don't you guys do what you do?  Play with the clip.  I got to take a break.  You're like the stand-up expert on the show, so if we're doing Laura Bush stand-up, we 
[03:25:00]  need you.  So why don't you take a quick break, and we'll finish the show next.  All right?  Let's do that.  The very worst of the Opie and Anthony F.U.  Yeah, let me get a big F.U.  out to Landmark Realty and Waiting River.  They fucked me on my house.  Yeah, I'm a truck driver, and I just want to give a big fuck you to the cock-sucking  faggot that pulls up next to me while I'm driving through Indianapolis giving me the let-me-suck-your-cock 
[03:25:30]  gesture.  Fuck you!  I'd like to give a big fuck you to Las Vegas.  I just moved here from Boston, missed out on Norton's show this past weekend, and what  do we got this weekend coming up?  Rich fucking Voss.  Fuck you, Las Vegas.  Yeah, I want to give a big fuck you to Rosie O'Donnell for that horrible performance of  a retard last week.  I'd like to leave a big fuck you to my mother-in-law.  I'm tired of your mouth.  I'm tired of your attitude.  If you're a rich bitch, fuck you.  This is a big F.U.  to Yoko Ono and her ass. 
[03:26:00]  She's called singing.  Fuck you, Yoko.  Fuck you.  Call the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line at 1-866-FU-LINE-1.  1-866-FU-LINE-1.  Oh, fuck you very much.  Alright.  So what's the deal with Laura Bush?  Everyone's talking about that today as well.  She's made a lot of the front pages of the newspapers. 
[03:26:30]  What, they did some kind of a...  It was a roast type of thing?  It was the Washington press, and the whole Washington...  All the politicians and everybody get together, and it's a fun night out for all of them.  And they give speeches, and they're usually, yeah, kind of roast-like, you know.  She was funny.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What have we got here, a fucking comedian?  She was funny? 
[03:27:00]  Mm-hmm.  She had some funny lines.  Her delivery, you know, because she's the first lady.  She's not a comic, so...  Yeah.  ...you know, her delivery is a little off.  Okay.  But when you think about, you know, she's talking about the president here, and he really didn't  look amused.  He's kind of sitting there, and...  He's a good old boy.  ...it's like he's kind of forcing the laugh.  You know, they think in...  So they said, this will be good for your image, you know.  Yeah, so we got a sense of humor.  Right.  So that's why he did it, but I don't think he really enjoyed it.  Because women in Texas are second-class citizens.  Texas? 
[03:27:30]  Definitely Texas.  Alabama.  Arkansas.  Mm-hmm.  Uh.  And Rhode Island.  Rhode Island, too.  Lesbians there, but...  Ooh.  About second-class citizens.  That's where the lesbians are, Rhode Island.  Rhode Island.  A lot of lesbians in Rhode Island.  Really?  Yeah.  Yep.  All right.  Let's listen to the first lady doing some comedy.  But, Cedric, I think you'll appreciate this, and you can use it if you want to.  See, there was a city slicker who was driving around lost, and he came across this old cowboy. 
[03:28:00]  And so the city slicker asked the old guy how to get to the nearest town, and he got  that old joke.  Not again.  See, she comes out and interrupts his old joke that he bombs with.  He tells that joke everywhere.  Was that the setup, you think?  That was the setup.  He starts telling this old joke, here, here, an old cattleman, and here, here.  And then she comes out and kind of breaks it up with, oh, not that old joke.  Oh, so that was the setup to get her up there to do some joke. 
[03:28:30]  Right.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I wanted to hear his other joke.  What do you say to a black man in a three-piece suit?  Well, what you do, you put Velcro on the ceiling and have him jump on the bed.  Yeah.  Well, I got another one.  This is going to be fun because he really doesn't have a clue about what I'm going to say next. 
[03:29:00]  Stop it after it doesn't have a clue.  He says he's delighted to come to these press dinners.  Baloney.  Why are they laughing there?  Uh, because, I don't know, I don't like, I think they all thought she said baloney.  Blow me?  Yeah.  Well, blow me.  Why are they laughing?  I hate that.  Because it's the first lady.  Baloney is a funny word.  Yeah, she's like, ah, bullshit.  Bullshit would have got a standing ovation.  Bullshit.  That would have rocked.  Yeah. 
[03:29:30]  Why not?  Yeah.  He's usually in bed by now.  I'm not kidding.  I said to him the other day, George, if you really want to end tyranny in the world, you're going to have to stay up later.  Wow.  That's kind of, you know, kind of creepy.  Talking about the president and his policy of ending tyranny around the world, and it turns out to be just a, you know, it's a little joke. 
[03:30:00]  Then I put a little leash around his neck and I dragged him around the room and I took photographs, my thumb up.  Thumb up.  She did that.  I made him and Dick Cheney get into a naked pyramid.  I am married to the president of the United States, and here's our typical evening.  Nine o'clock.  Mr. Excitement here is sound asleep. 
[03:30:30]  And I'm watching Desperate Housewives.  Oh, they're roaring.  With Lynn Cheney.  Ladies and gentlemen, I am a Desperate Housewife.  She missed a great line.  Why?  I mean, if...  She should have said, if Lynn wants Dick to eat her pussy, she has to put nitroglycerin inside of it. 
[03:31:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, that would have got a laugh.  That's the one for today, kids.  I thought Penny and Gums was going to do it.  Pennies and Gum, but...  That's the showstopper right there.  I mean, if those women on that show think they're desperate, they ought to be with George. 
[03:31:30]  Wow.  Now she's knocking his sexual prowess.  One night.  Laughing at the guy that can't satisfy his woman.  Well, they're just laughing because he goes to bed early.  I don't think they're saying that he's not a good fuck.  She's a desperate housewife.  It means she's looking for something she's not getting.  Well, the next joke she did was, she said, he fucks worse than he talks.  I've got to go to the phones here.  Jeff in Canada.  Jeff? 
[03:32:00]  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, Jeff.  Jeff getting the XM illegally.  What's up, Jeff?  I was going to say, since playing the bridge of Austin, I started writing for Laura Bush.  Come on, Laura.  This is a funny line.  You wish it.  Very good, Jeff.  Love you, Jimmy.  Thanks, fella from Canada.  All right, there goes Jeff.  Bye.  But George and I are complete opposites.  I'm quiet.  He's talkative.  I'm introverted.  He's extroverted.  I can pronounce nuclear. 
[03:32:30]  You kind of fumbled the line, but that is kind of funny.  That would have been a great line.  But the guy can't say nuclear.  And pronounce, she's tripped over it.  But that's the worst time to mispronounce a word.  I know.  You're doing a weird pronunciation.  That has Voss written all over it.  Can't pronounce nuclear.  Holy shit, De Niro at the end of Raging Bull?  If he's a degenerate, did I say that?  Did I say that?  Shut up, you.  I love when he starts yelling at the people in the audience.  You're going to force me to make a comeback. 
[03:33:00]  Fuck you.  And the horse you rode in on.  And the whole cavalry behind you.  This fucking dumb mook.  That was his idea of being funny around those idiots at the Culver.  They probably thought he was a real scream.  Fuck you.  Ah, Jake, you're hilarious.  But George and I are complete opposites.  I'm quiet.  He's talkative.  I'm introverted.  He's extroverted.  I can pronounce nuclear. 
[03:33:30]  Ah, predict.  It's nuclear.  The amazing thing, however, is that George and I were just meant to be.  I was a librarian who spent 12 hours a day in the library.  Yet somehow I met George.  That's a great line, though.  That's kind of funny.  Who wrote this stuff?  That's a really good line.  Who wrote it?  Someone had to write this stuff.  Someone wrote it.  She didn't come up with this crap on her own. 
[03:34:00]  Come on.  One night after George went to bed, Lynn Cheney, Condi Rice, Karen Hughes, and I went to Chippendales.  I wouldn't even mention it, except Ruth Ginsburg and Sandra Day O'Connor saw us there.  I won't tell you what happened, but Lynn's Secret Service codename is now Dollar Bill. 
[03:34:30]  And mine's old glazed donut face.  Yeah, could you picture them all out there at Chippendales?  Stop it.  All getting Roman war helmets.  That's good.  There's the one line.  That's all they have?  Isn't there supposed to be another line?  Jimmy was talking about one. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah, there's two more to go here.  All right.  Someone is telling us we should watch Maury, so I was just taking a peek, see if we're missing anything.  Mom, you need to know my sister and I are prostitutes on today's Maury.  Fantastic.  All right.  I hope they have contact numbers.  So many mothers today are just not involved in their children's lives.  Not a problem with Barbara Bush.  People often wonder what my mother-in-law's really like.  People think she's a sweet, grandmotherly, Aunt Bea type. 
[03:35:30]  She's actually more like Don Corleone.  Cedric, am I doing all right?  Cedric, the entertainer.  She's feeling good, huh?  Yeah.  Look, look how he massacred the Middle East.  Great. 
[03:36:00]  She's cracking him up.  Yeah, Cedric was the...  He's cracking him up.  He was the emcee or something?  No, the comic.  We have one more clip and I don't think the joke you were talking about when you got here today.  It was a horse cock joke.  How did they miss that?  Well, let's see.  It's a horse cock joke.  Maybe it's in here.  I don't know.  Maybe.  We met and married and I became one of the regulars up at Kennebunkport.  All the Bushes love Kennebunkport, which is like Crawford but without the nightlife.  People ask me what it's like to be up there with the whole Bush clan. 
[03:36:30]  Let me put it this way.  First prize, three-day vacation with the Bush family.  Second prize, ten days.  Why?  Because it's not fun, I guess, to be up there with the Bushes.  Here's what it's like to be on the Bush ranch.  If you're black, you better be wearing a red jacket and holding a lantern on the front lawn.  What was the joke they missed?  Something about the first time her husband went to milk a cow, but it was a horse and it was a male horse. 
[03:37:00]  Are you kidding?  She did a president jerked off a male horse joke.  Really?  Yeah.  Horse gag reference would have probably been a little bit better, but she didn't go for that one.  Yeah, it was a great joke.  I just wish I had...  I laughed out loud when I heard that on the AOL thing.  What a fucking fat chick in the Midwest.  I click on AOL and I laugh at the first thing.  Oh, you laugh at LOL.  Tee hee.  That's great.  All right.  Jungle Jim Kim.  Nice.  Andy, what else you got over there, buddy? 
[03:37:30]  Oh, sorry.  This is one of these Gigi Allen dolls I used to make for Norton, because this is from Merle.  Oh, my God.  I was hanging out with Merle, Gigi's brother, and...  He's covered in crap.  Oh, yeah.  He's bleeding, pissing, and there's a little...  A little turd coming out of his ass.  ...out of his ass.  It's all cut off.  A little felt log.  I love that.  Yeah.  It's all hand-crafted.  Beautiful dish.  Are the tattoos accurate?  Yeah.  Yeah, they're actually better than his actual tattoos. 
[03:38:00]  Scum fuck.  Life sucks.  Gigi was great.  He was one of a kind.  Gotta love Gigi.  Good old Gigi Allen.  Gigi.  Gigi.  Rob on Long Island, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  How you doing, precious?  Hi, Rob.  Thanks for calling the program.  No problem.  Yeah, I learned that Anthony's house is full of humming germophobes.  Humming germophobes.  Yeah, we learned that thing in the program.  Right you are, sir.  Pinchy from Cleveland.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  What's up, buddy?  Hey, Boo Boo Bear. 
[03:38:30]  Hello, Pinchy.  Hey, I learned today that Club Soda Kenny has the lower intestine of a goose with Parkinson's.  Good call.  That was a good one, too.  Thanks, Pinchy.  Let's go to Shwuggie.  Hey, Shwuggie.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey, to answer your question, the guy who wrote that was Landon Harvan, who was a presidential  writer, who wrote back since the days of the Reagan administration.  Really?  He wrote Laura's stuff?  Yeah.  Wow, he's good.  He's a comic advisor to the presidents?  Yeah.  Well, he writes a lot of serious political speeches, but he's also a writer. 
[03:39:00]  What a scream he is.  Yeah.  That was pretty funny.  He's a panic.  All right.  Put you down.  Okay.  Thank you.  Panic.  God, this show flew today.  Fantastic.  Today, I learned Rosie has the legs of a fat white panda.  That was a good one.  Yes, we did learn that.  I like that one a lot.  I like to whip her legs.  You ever see Dirty Rotten Scoundrels?  How when Michael Caine, when he runs in and just whips Steve Martin's legs with a cord  or something?  Oh.  Or no, he whips it with a cane?  I didn't see that.  It's a great leg whipping scene. 
[03:39:30]  Good leg whipping.  Right across the...  Nice fat pale leg.  Boneless chicken legs are hers.  Big fat pale leg.  Yeah.  Big nuggets.  Let's go to Mike in Cleveland.  Mike, what's up, buddy?  Hey, today I learned that the subplot to the Rosie O'Donnell movie was that the fat rich  neighbor stole her bike.  Pee-wee, right?  Pee-wee bike.  Wow, that's exceptionally loud.  Yeah, perfect.  Andy, are you done? 
[03:40:00]  More or less?  Yeah, I'm pretty much done.  I'm going to be up in New York in a couple weeks doing the Roseland tattoo show.  When is that?  Because I'm in town, so I'll go to that.  Roseland Ballroom.  It's the 13th, 14th, and 15th.  Friday, Saturday, Sunday?  Yeah.  It's huge.  They have it every year.  And there's sideshow performers and bands.  They've got to bring back the sideshow.  It's not the fake sideshow.  No, no.  The working acts.  That stinks.  I mean, I appreciate it and all, but I want to see Turtle Boy.  Of course. 
[03:40:30]  You know, on this.  All the PC crap is getting in the way of a good sideshow.  Right.  Like a retard in a dress with a top knot on my head running around laughing.  Now it's all fake stuff.  Yeah.  You got a lesbian with a sense of humor.  No.  Will the hot chicks be with you?  Yeah.  Certainly worth the price of admission.  Lovely.  We're getting, I'm getting a report that somebody here is writing that it wasn't Landon Parvin  that wrote that.  Howard S. from New York is saying he wrote this years ago. 
[03:41:00]  Howard S.  Of course he did.  That's very funny.  I didn't even get it.  I'm so dumb.  Donahue from Philly.  Yeah, I learned that.  And only the young die hard.  Oh, I'm not even going to.  See, now I'm not going to be able to listen to the replay because it's going to come out  to that part and I'm going to get all hot and sweaty.  Why?  It was huge.  I'm going to be like, oh, I'm going to have to turn the volume down.  It was the worst.  Because I was so, yeah, duh. 
[03:41:30]  God, I do that all the time with my MiFi.  Oh, here's the part where I really ate it.  I can't even listen to it.  Turn it down.  I don't want to hear it.  I've got to go to Squiz for a few minutes.  That's all right.  The one line I said perfectly was a fat, juicy JFK bomb.  Boy, that was a crisp, clear delivery.  We all had our moments today.  David Ferry and Clayshaw.  Yep, it's on.  All right, Pat from Boston.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Learned that a retarded, unwashed genital mix smells like a Reuben sandwich. 
[03:42:00]  Very good.  Let's go to Chris.  Chris, what did you learn on the O.P. and Anthony show today?  Guys, a great show today.  I laughed my ass off.  I learned that retards shit bubblegum and pennies.  That was my favorite today.  That was my favorite.  All right, thank you.  Hemorrhage learned that Bob Kelly was crying during the entire show.  Weeping.  Blubbering fat ass.  Kenny, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned from Professor Anthony that the lesbians are indeed in Rhode Island.  Right. 
[03:42:30]  All right, Dan from Hoboken.  Is it the Dan from Hoboken?  I learned Anthony's favorite movie is Die Young with Vengeance.  Today, I learned that Kim Fuck was a napalmed cocktease.  That's a belt of scotch from Whackbag.com.  Golden buns from Whackbag.  I learned that O.P. is all about the dip.  Golden buns.  D-Nice from O.T.  What's O.T.?  Any one time?  Ontario, O.T.  Utah, O.T. 
[03:43:00]  O.T.  O.T.  That's not a United States state.  All right.  Today on the show, I learned that Rhode Island is full of lesbians.  Ontario, Canada.  Probably Ontario.  All right.  They're listening to XM like crazy up in Canada.  We love you Canadian bastards.  Freddie B. from Philly.  I learned that Anthony is old enough to know a thing or two about a thing or two.  This boy's life.  Evil G. from Jersey.  I learned not to look into a retard's eyes.  Shut your pie hole.  You shut your goddamn pie hole.  Goddamn pie hole.  I knew you'd do quite the impression of me. 
[03:43:30]  Do me.  Come on.  K. from Cali.  Today, I learned that C is for chromosome.  That Rosie is missing.  Sorry.  I stumbled over that one there.  Mike from Philly.  What do you have, man?  Yo, I learned that O.P. is getting rid of the negativity out of his life by giving the  pickled punks back to the rightful owner.  There you go.  It can't hurt at this point.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Buck in Tennessee.  Buck, what did you learn on the program today?  I learned that the only way that Lane Jenny can get her pussy is by stepping up with natural 
[03:44:00]  glyceros.  Did you have to stumble through that one?  Oh, my God.  You stuttering, muttering prick.  Jesus.  Old stroke mouth.  Satansideshow.com.  Anything else, Andy?  No, that's it.  I'll just, I'll be back and I'll see you guys next time.  All right.  Everybody go home.  This is the BD Mini Show. </pre>
