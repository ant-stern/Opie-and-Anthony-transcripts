<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a heavily promoted "Sam Asks for a Raise Wednesday" segment.  This recurring bit featured pre-recorded, listener-submitted audio pieces, many using highly offensive language to support Sam Roberts' salary increase demand.  Sam threatened to quit by the end of August if his request wasn't met. The hosts discussed the potential ramifications of Sam's actions for the show's staff, including underpaid interns and the surprising absence of Gary, a key staff member, on vacation.  The discussion then veered into upcoming guests: Ryan Reynolds, Jason Bateman, and Guy Fieri, transitioning into explicit commentary on the actresses' nudity in *The Change-Up*, alongside various tangents about other movies, television shows, and personal childhood experiences. E-Rock’s improved punctuality was also noted, and Casey Anthony's situation was briefly discussed.

The show then transitioned into a discussion between the hosts and Jim Norton about their dysfunctional childhoods, focusing on their mothers and experiences with physical abuse and difficult family relationships.  One host detailed his brother's arrest for threatening their mother. They linked these experiences to their adult relationships, noting patterns of attracting negativity.  The hosts discussed their career paths and speculated about the connection between their upbringing and their need for attention. One host explicitly stated he was not engaging in "woe is me" storytelling.

Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds then joined the show to promote *The Change-Up*.  The interview covered the film's R-rated nature, their experiences with body-switching comedies, and anecdotes from their careers, including discussions about the challenges of marketing an R-rated comedy and the changing landscape of comedy. Bateman discussed his sister's career transition into digital media, and recounted a near-arrest for a prank. The interview also touched upon Bateman’s work on *Arrested Development* and other projects, referencing films like *Animal House*, *Porky's*, and *Horrible Bosses*.  The segment concluded with a "F.U." segment featuring vulgar listener calls and further discussion of Bateman and Reynolds' careers, ending with commentary on the Coliseum Project and the MTA, including strong opinions on the Nassau County vote regarding its funding.

The next segment began with a discussion about nepotism and corruption within government agencies like the MTA and TSA, followed by a rant about the inefficiency of toll collection businesses and poor road construction.  The hosts speculated about potential state secession and a humorous suggestion of another civil war.  They then discussed Grayson Chance, a 13-year-old YouTube piano prodigy, his record deal, and speculation about his sexuality, comparing him to Justin Bieber.  The segment returned to "Sam Asks for a Raise Wednesday," including more listener-submitted audio pieces.  Sexually suggestive commentary on a paparazzi photo of Selena Gomez was followed by a personal anecdote about the hosts' past "peeping Tom" activities.  The latter half featured an interview with Michael Ian Black, discussing his career, large Twitter following, his less-than-enthusiastic opinion of Ryan Reynolds' acting, his new stand-up special, and parenthood. They reminisced about past television shows and the segment concluded with Black promoting his book and stand-up special.

The show continued with a discussion about the hosts' dislike of children and an anecdote about a razor blade coffee table. Jim Norton recounted a negative experience with GoDaddy, transitioning into a discussion with Michael Ian Black about the changing online landscape.  A comedic skit, "Spectacular Suicide," featuring Angerman was played.  Guy Fieri then arrived with food and his culinary team, leading to a segment where the hosts and Fieri sampled various foods and cocktails.  Significant effort was made, unsuccessfully, to get Sam to eat the food. Bernie Williams' brief appearance interrupted the food segment. The segment concluded with continued discussion of the food and playful banter.

A subsequent segment featured more playful banter with Guy Fieri, including discussions about his life in wine country, prison visits, and family. He presented the hosts with Ergo Chef knives, leading to jokes about their potential uses.  A large amount of food was consumed, with humorous comments about eating habits.  Fieri promoted his products and upcoming Food Network show, "Rachel versus Guy." The conversation shifted to pornography and childhood experiences with pornography and medical textbooks. Listener calls and banter followed. A heated exchange between Troy and Eric, concerning Eric's eating habits and lifestyle choices, ensued, with Opie, Chip Chipperson, and listeners contributing.  Further discussion of food, Fieri’s departure, and the day’s events concluded the segment with off-color jokes.

The final segment focused on Eric's eating habits, with speculation about his age and health, leading to insults and mocking comments.  A food-related incident involving Eric cutting in line was discussed, along with arguments and jokes about staff eating habits and workplace dynamics.  Sterniolo and Roland were mentioned, particularly involved in the back-and-forth with Troy. Jim, Kenny, Marcos (on the Atkins diet), and Jason Shibiro were also mentioned. The segment concluded with sarcastic appreciation for everyone involved and a reference to a future continuation of the conversation, briefly mentioning a hypothetical future for Eric involving Guy Fieri.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for, it's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:00:30]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:01:00]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:01:30]  Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:02:00]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:02:30]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:03:00]  Opie and Anthony Show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:03:30]  What the hell am I doing here?  Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:04:00]  Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony Show.  I gotta say, I gotta say, I gotta say right off the bat, I've never been more excited to do a radio show than I am today.  I have to say, I have to say it. 
[00:04:30]  I have to say, I have to say, I have to say, I have to say, I have to say, I have to say, I have to say it.  And you might say, why? Is it because you have all these amazing guests coming in today?  Oh my God.  Like Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman from the movie Change Up.  Or Michael Ian Black.  Yes.  Or Guy Fieri who's gonna be cooking for us.  Oh, that's all great stuff.  Oh boy, is it great.  But that's not the reason why I'm so excited to do today's radio show.  Why are you so excited?  Well, today is Sam Asked for a Raise Wednesday.  Sam Asked for a Raise Wednesday. 
[00:05:00]  We did discuss this yesterday, and it is indeed Sam Asks for a Raise Wednesday.  Yes.  It goes down today, bitches.  Yeah.  What time is it going down, Sam?  What time is it going down?  What time you go in there?  I haven't finalized a specific time of day yet.  You have to sit here until at least 10 o'clock.  Then you gotta do the after show until 11.  Then you gotta do your Hits 1 show.  Then you gotta do your comedy show.  Then you gotta prepare for the Sam and Dave show.  So somewhere in there, you're gonna be asking for a raise.  I would assume around 12 to 1-ish. 
[00:05:30]  You think that's a good raise time?  And are you gonna alert everybody on Twitter?  When you're marching down that hall?  Yeah.  And getting the respect you deserve?  You should just tweet, here it comes, bitches.  Right.  Yeah.  Can you just tweet that when we know you're marching down the hall?  Yeah.  And then we'll all be alerted out there.  Oh, fuck.  Here goes Sam.  Showing balls finally after seven years.  Well, I mean, I've just had balls here and there.  Oh, well.  I could carry it away. 
[00:06:00]  And could you also ask about our interns, too?  Because I remember three months ago, that dope Gary came to me and he said,  Hey, we're making progress on the intern situation.  Yeah, progress is being made.  That was three months ago.  Don't say that if there's no progress being made.  Do you know how long...  I wasn't born yesterday.  Oh, but do you know how long, like, something in the space program takes when they say we're  making progress?  Yeah.  It could be five years later.  Yeah.  That's what I think they're kind of basing it on.  Oh, they're on NASA time?  Yeah, it's like a NASA thing where it's like, we're making progress. 
[00:06:30]  We just got to, you know, invent 800 more things before we can even, you know, put it on the  board.  All right, fair enough.  Could you ask him if he's on NASA time as far as our interns go?  Yeah.  That we were making progress on at least three months ago.  At least.  It might be even longer that he said that.  I can't ask him today.  Well, Sam, are you excited?  No, but today is ask for a raise day.  You don't want to mix them up.  Who's on vacation?  The guy you just mentioned.  He's not here?  No.  He hasn't been here all week?  What?  I thought you guys knew that. 
[00:07:00]  Whoa.  I seem to have forgotten.  Wow, someone's not important.  Wow, the show just rolls right along with some of the best guests we've had.  Right.  There's nary a speed bump in the road of this show when he's on vacation.  Wow, that's kind of awkward to go on vacation and no one notices.  You sure don't want to do that.  We're setting up a five-star restaurant today without him for Guy Fieri.  That's insulting.  But today is a big day for Sam. 
[00:07:30]  I'm so excited for you, Sam.  The bravery that we're looking at with Sam because he is going in there to put his job on the line  and say, if I don't get this raise, I am gone.  You are losing me, Sam Roberts.  Yes, by the end of the summer, right?  We said by the end of the month.  Not we, you.  By the end of August, Sam has agreed.  That's it.  It's over.  I know you're rolling the dice, but we're going to drive them insane in the next month that  I think they might see it our way.  Because production pieces are already coming in. 
[00:08:00]  They are.  And names are being mentioned.  Oh, God.  Look how good Eastside Dave is doing since he gave him the ultimatum.  He's doing great.  See, he's doing those videos from his house.  Yeah, they do very well.  Where he seems to fall down.  Doesn't pay the fucking mortgage, but they're doing very well.  Fall down in his underwear in every episode.  And yell into the camera.  I mean, they're good every time.  By the way, hilarious every time.  Sure.  You know.  But they do have a basic theme.  Falling down the stairs. 
[00:08:30]  Falling down the stairs in his underwear and yelling at the camera.  Will get me every fucking time.  And I'm not even lying, but, you know, maybe monetizing.  He's a father of two small children.  He shouldn't be falling down the stairs in his underwear.  He puts them in the videos, and they laugh their asses off at him falling down the stairs in his underwear.  Or they start crying hysterically.  Well, the problem is I'm not looking for YouTube hits.  No?  You know, I'm getting married in less than a year, and it's more of a financial issue.  Your wife will respect that if you finally show some balls and some aptitude. 
[00:09:00]  Aptitude.  Oh, yes.  Aptitude.  She'll respect that if you march down there and you start taking what's yours.  Think how happy she's going to be when you come home and go, baby.  They fucking blinked, and I'm getting that raise because I put my job on the line.  That's the kind of guy you're marrying.  A lot of people want to wish you the best of luck today on the phones already.  Still in Baltimore and a few others.  That's awesome.  And we have production pieces.  The listeners have come through.  Oh, they have really come through. 
[00:09:30]  I heard one last night online.  Oh.  Unbelievable.  We have four of them.  Oh, my God.  Already.  And we just asked for these not even 24 hours ago.  So you can only imagine how many will come in every single Wednesday.  Right.  I mean, it's nice to be supported.  I will say that.  Of course it is.  I just hope this isn't being counteractive.  Well, here's our pal Coke Logic.  He sent something in to support you.  Well, if I know Coke Logic, he hasn't taken this too far. 
[00:10:00]  No, not at all.  No, I don't think so.  It's Sam asks for a raise.  Axe.  You want ax?  I'm axing.  Yeah, you're axing.  Sam axing for a raise Wednesday has begun.  And here's the first production piece from Coke Logic.  Attention, assholes in management.  Guess what?  Sam Roberts needs a fucking raise.  And you're going to fucking give it to him.  Not only that, you're going to give a raise to the whole O&A staff. 
[00:10:30]  And while you're at it, fix the fucking online fee.  Hallelujah.  What is the word?  He's proven to be the same.  Oh, my gosh.  You marched down that hall, Sam.  You marched down that hall.  I got goosebumps. 
[00:11:00]  Here he comes, bitches.  This is amazing.  Six hours from now, Sam is going to be asking for a raise, bitches.  Oh, man.  I'm tearing up.  Fucking goosebumps, Sam Roberts.  I'm tearing up.  Look at those goosebumps.  That is haunting.  Fucking A it is.  The power behind that makes you...  How are you sitting there now and not right now much?  You should be shadowboxing. 
[00:11:30]  Get up and shadowbox right now.  That's just it, but I mean...  It is theatrical.  That is great.  That'll be great to play as you're walking out with your fucking box from the office with all your possessions in it.  The Sam Roberts nameplate sticking out of the top of a plant.  Yeah, trying to fucking hit the elevator button with his knee because both his hands are full and no one will press it.  No.  I'm sure the security guard that would escort me out would.  Good morning.  By the way...  Good morning.  By the way, you're the face of what's going on here, Sam.  Yeah, I'm the...  We're focusing on you, but there's a lot of people that are going to appreciate it when you finally get your raise because that means they're getting their raise. 
[00:12:00]  I'm the union rep.  We just had a...  There you are.  They just reported earnings in the second quarter.  This company's doing fine, man.  And it's time for Sam Roberts to get a raise.  It is time.  You want the next production piece?  Oh, please.  Yeah.  John Sheetsley, it looks like.  Hey, Sheetsley.  Yeah.  If you send these in, like, if you have a Twitter, let us know your Twitter so we can promote you a little bit.  Because no one's going to remember John Sheetsley after we play his production.  Sounds like a Harry Potter name. 
[00:12:30]  All right, here you go.  The second production piece for Sam Axe.  Axe.  Axe for a raise Wednesday, which has begun today.  Five years ago, Sam Roberts began as an intern at XM Satellite Radio for the Opie and Anthony Show.  I'm primetime Sam Roberts, and I brought my camera.  Yay!  Oh, and there's a small chance I may be black.  Now, just five years later, he's on damn near every channel on the platform. 
[00:13:00]  It's after Opie and Anthony live here on Sirius 206, XM 105, Sirius XM, it's one, I'm primetime Sam Roberts.  Do you ever wonder if Kesha had her name legally changed to include the dollar sign?  I know I have.  Welcome to OutQ, bitches.  And now, for the first time in his radio career, Sam Roberts has something to say.  I want my fucking money!  The Sam and Tomato. 
[00:13:30]  Rated R for racial uncertainty.  Under 17, not admitted without parent.  Hey, that's all right, man.  And by the way...  That's all right.  A spot-on Sam Roberts impression right there, that guy did.  Very good.  Whoever's playing me in this film did a good job.  And it does a good job of telling the story of a youthful, enthusiastic young intern who's  just happy to have a video camera all the way up to current day.  I think it's...  Well, you look a little miserable today.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I mean...  And you looked miserable yesterday.  It started to eat at you, isn't it?  I think it's more about the getting the raise part. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That thing.  You know.  You like the way it says that you're a young man and now you've parlayed that energy into  job burnout.  Yeah.  Not being shaven.  Yeah.  Self-hatred and about to be fired.  That's actually...  That's accurate.  Oh, this is exciting, sir.  It really is.  It is.  I got a pep in my step today, sir.  I'm glad you do, and I'm glad I brought that to you.  So you're going to tweet today, right?  Yeah.  What's the tweet you're going to send out?  Here I go, bitches?  Here I come, bitches.  Here I come, bitches?  Yeah. 
[00:14:30]  How about here I go, bitches?  Here I go?  Is that better?  That means everyone can visualize that you're getting off your seat and marching down the  long hall.  But if he says here I come, then he's talking directly to them.  That's right.  Oh, I like that.  That's even more pompous.  Fair enough.  I like it.  And I'm a pompous individual.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Want to hear another production piece?  Sounds like a good idea, but I don't know if it is.  Huh?  I said it sounds like a good idea, but I don't know if it is.  Oh, it's a great idea.  All right.  Of course it is.  This is Garen Benner. 
[00:15:00]  He sent this in.  Garen Benner.  What wrote these people's names?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Garen Benner?  Why?  All these names are confusing.  One guy's name was Shirtsleeve or something?  Sheetsleeve.  And this guy is Garen Benner?  Garen.  G-A-R-O-N.  As in Baron.  Garen.  Very strange names out there.  Garen Benner.  By the way, if you're working on your production pieces for Axe for Array's Wednesday, Sam's  Axe for Array's Wednesday, we'll play all the new ones next Wednesday.  That's exciting for everyone, though.  Maybe we'll even have a few tomorrow just to see what everyone's up to. 
[00:15:30]  Just to spice it up.  Just to keep people working through the weekend.  Yeah, because when you start a new bit, you've really got to push hard in the beginning.  And then it kind of sails on its own.  Here's Garen Benner.  Sam asked for Array's Wednesday.  Do you have Array's, sir?  I don't know.  How many weeks has it been?  Are you Sam Roberts underpaid at SiriusXM Satellite Radio?  This whole thing is not working out well.  You deserve Array's, and now we're going to go with a production piece.  In a world of fish sticks and wrestling, Sam Roberts is an asshole. 
[00:16:00]  I don't care about these guys.  You're ungrateful.  And he's black.  N-double-A-C-P.  Oh, Carolina Man wants lasers.  Wednesday, he begs for money from the man, Steve Blatter. 
[00:16:30]  How would you say I had his name?  That's right.  Steve Blatter.  Wednesdays, Sam asks for a raise.  Now I know management a little bit.  Yeah.  The little time I spent with them, and they're not happy that they're part of this.  I know I'm a little bit better.  So they might cave really quickly.  Yeah, I think they're going to just want to put this behind them and settle it by giving you your raise.  Right.  That's my prediction.  Or settle it by saying if you come in here again, you're fired. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, no.  Well, either way, there'll be a solution finally to this.  It's worth rolling the dice, isn't it?  I'll tell you this.  It'll be a story.  Yeah.  I mean, no, they're not happy to be involved.  No, I have some issues with that production piece, context issues.  Huh?  Over the way the...  We're not telling people what to do with their fucking production pieces.  No, you're right.  We haven't...  We've barely said anything about it.  But if I'm here to represent not only this show, but the staff, and kind of be the union rep, 
[00:17:30]  I guess I have to take that responsibility on, don't I?  You're representing everyone that's underpaid here at SiriusXM, including me, Anthony, and  Jim Norton.  I'm representing you guys.  You are.  We're all underpaid, sir.  Okay.  You are.  Come on now.  Do us justice.  The fact is, we haven't had a raise in three years either.  Yeah.  Do you think we'd let you get fired?  Obviously, we make more money than you, so it's a little easier, but we haven't had a  raise either.  Huh?  I said, do you think we'd let you get fired? 
[00:18:00]  And he said, no.  And he's right.  I mean, we may not have the choice, but I mean, if it's our choice, we wouldn't let  you get fired.  If it's not our choice, then that's a big if.  I can't wait for the other production pieces to come in, because they're working on them.  Yeah.  There's people out there, they didn't realize they needed to get them in today.  Yeah, people thought, or they thought, oh, this will blow over, not realizing.  No, no, no, no.  They're working on stuff.  They are.  Which means they're probably going to be even better than the ones we heard, which is hard  to believe, because these are great.  I mean, I'm not going to say they're not well done, because they are well done.  And matter of fact, I don't think it would be too much to say that some of these fans 
[00:18:30]  maybe should get a little paycheck for adding some content to the show.  Who's going to pay them?  Well, I'll be their union rep, too.  Really?  Yeah.  You're going to try to get some pocket money out of these guys, too, that you can throw  around?  Yeah.  Pocket money?  Pocket money's important.  Well, to E-Rock especially.  He loves going to conventions with pocket money.  I want to congratulate E-Rock for showing up today at 5...  47.  47. 
[00:19:00]  That's it.  5.47?  Not bad.  Four minutes earlier than yesterday.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Someone turned over a new leaf.  That's right.  Oh, Jesus.  Someone's got a fucking gleam in his eye.  Someone else has a pep in their heavy step.  A pep in their...  Why did you have to have heavy?  He had a pep in his trudge.  A pep in his trudge.  I noticed the pep in his step.  The water I have on the console was rippling in my glass.  Remember?  Jurassic Park.  Oh, there's so many union guys so happy you just said union. 
[00:19:30]  Why?  They're so happy.  Holy shit.  Sam said union.  That's the way to go right there, brother.  Union rep.  Oh, hell.  Oh, fuck.  They don't want to hear union ever in this business.  We should do it, then.  We've come across guys over the years that have tried to get a radio union together.  Yeah.  Good luck.  And what ends up happening, everyone gets fired.  I'm sure that would happen.  Everyone gets fired.  I mean, there's no...  You know when you hear about a radio station and all of a sudden they go to like a light  FM format?  That's because some idiot in that station tried to start a union.  You know, if we all pull together, guys, and approach management together, they won't 
[00:20:00]  have any choice but to...  And now, a new format.  As we start there, the guy's like, what happened?  What happened?  What about after?  They are the union.  They've never helped radio guys who are in trouble.  No, that's a joke.  They're a joke.  I've been paying dues to those fuckers for 10 years.  I've never even fucking had a phone call with them.  You don't still pay anyone?  This is not an after gig.  Yeah, I know, but why are we still paying?  Why would you still pay?  You know, this is not an after gig.  I don't know.  We pay for insurance or something. 
[00:20:30]  I have no idea.  Oh, okay.  Like, part of our insurance goes through that.  All right, okay.  I don't know.  I don't fucking...  I don't fucking...  But they don't help anybody.  They've never come to anybody's aid who's been in trouble for language or any of that  shit.  They never stick up to people.  We had one of the biggest radio stories ever, and we didn't even get a phone call from  those fuckers.  No, no help.  No, nothing.  They're a joke.  Not even a call to see what the fuck it was all about.  No, they're terrible.  All right, here's the official production piece for Sam Axe for a Raise Wednesday. 
[00:21:00]  All right.  It's Ask for a Raise Wednesday.  You know why he's here, bitch.  He remembers Cape Cod and driving six hours to get back from work Monday morning.  He even had to get a discount on a shitty engagement ring from one of our sponsors because  he couldn't afford one at full price.  Take this job and shove it.  If you're not going to pay him, he's packing his bags and hitting the bricks.  You can't fire him because he's quitting.  Sayonara.  Adios.  Out the door.  Gone forever.  So long, measly paycheck. 
[00:21:30]  It's time to show Sam Roberts the money.  Show me the money!  There you have it.  No turning back now, Sam.  The engagement ring wasn't shitty.  No?  The engagement ring.  It was actually a very nice ring.  Oh.  I'm not going to say I didn't get it on a discount, but it's a very nice ring.  I didn't have to go to a fucking sponsor to get my ring, sir.  Oh, shit.  I mean, I did.  And I know he's a great sponsor.  Don't get me wrong.  But he hooked me up.  It's a very nice ring, but I definitely got a discount on it. 
[00:22:00]  Of course.  I spent a lot of money still.  Well, yeah.  But it was extremely discounted.  You would have liked to have spent more if they would have paid you more here, I'm sure.  Could have got a nicer ring.  Right.  Or if he felt his fiancée was worth more.  That was Sam just making a value judgment.  Oh.  Exactly right.  Yeah.  Let's just get him in trouble with everybody.  Hey, Sam made a decision.  He's like, you know, she gets this and that's what she gets.  That's this.  If I can't get it by this price, she gets nothing.  Yeah.  Fair enough.  Wow.  Sam's a man who puts his foot down.  Absolute nicest ring in my price range, which was a very nice ring. 
[00:22:30]  Very nice.  So the ultimatum, too, huh?  End of the month, I guess you're saying?  Well, the ultimatum is the one thing I question.  You get a raise or you quit?  As to whether or not that's a wise judgment.  Well, it's in a production piece.  You have no choice now.  Yeah.  When it's in a production piece, I mean, we can't redo the production piece.  I'm sorry.  No.  Production piece has been aired.  That's right.  That's it.  Here I come, bitches.  I can't wait for that tweet later today.  Is it going to make your day?  Oh, fuck yeah.  It's going to make my day.  Here I come, bitches.  Finally, something associated with this show will put you in a good mood. 
[00:23:00]  I'm in a good mood.  That'll be a good mood.  I'm in more good moods than bad moods these days.  What are you trying to say?  As opposed to the bad mood where it's like, well, it's 10 minutes of bad mood.  Yeah.  This should be.  No, this is a good mood.  This should be, yeah.  This is, you know, I don't talk about the good moods a lot.  This is a good mood all day long.  Oh, really?  Knowing that you're going to fucking tweet.  Here I come, bitches.  I will tweet that for you.  Can I come, bitches?  Fantastic.  Can you answer this?  After yesterday's awkward conversation about you and management and asking for a raise again, 
[00:23:30]  by the way, was there any weird moments in the hallways yesterday?  There's, I mean.  Is there a feeling that maybe people don't want to be involved with this?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  There was some weirdness.  It's rules.  Yeah.  There was some weirdness in a conversation that was had.  Really?  Yeah.  Yep.  Definitely some feelings of I'm kind of, I'm fed up with this bullshit type of thing. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  From people.  Oh, they're fed up.  How about you're fed up?  You haven't had a raise.  They didn't say the, they didn't.  They just keep giving you more responsibilities and shows.  Why don't you show some real guts and not do it on this floor?  March up the steps.  Anybody can go down and yell at bladder.  Great deal.  That is true.  You can't even get in trouble for yelling at bladder.  You might want to take this a little higher.  A little higher.  On the old totem pole here.  The real offices with the good vending machine upstairs, by the way.  And the pristine bathroom and the really nice kitchen and everything else they have up there. 
[00:24:30]  Did you know they had a better vending machine up there?  I had no idea.  I found that out on the QT.  Really?  It really bothers me.  We got graffiti on the walls down here at this point.  Yeah, with shit.  No one gives a fuck.  People write their name in shit at night in the bathroom.  It's horrible.  Shade 45 has been taking over a little too much lately.  Aw, hells.  Sway is a good show.  Yeah, we'll get to know Sway, I'm thinking.  One of these days.  He seems like he's open to maybe a little relationship between the two channels.  Stairs in the window all the time.  Stairs in the window all the time.  It's kind of something that goes on.  It's a little odd. 
[00:25:00]  He looks like Dwight looking into the bakery window in this boy's life.  According to his wife.  Hey, man.  If I went upstairs and did this, they would have no idea who I was.  They reported some nice earnings.  So I'm imagining that this whole raise and production thing, we're not going to have to do too long.  When did they report?  A couple days ago.  It's because they raised rates, right?  Did they?  Something like that.  I don't know.  That's good in this economy.  Then again, Sam's raise would be money the company is spending. 
[00:25:30]  That stock might go down a little.  No, if there's a happy Sam Roberts on the platform, stock prices go up.  No, that's true.  And the fact that you're paying a guy to do five, six, up to ten shows a day.  Yeah.  I would say that's accurate.  Yeah, that's economical right there.  That's showing.  And once again, he's just the face of what's going on here.  Oh, yeah.  Union.  Because I acknowledge that a lot of people, especially on our own staff, need raises besides  Sam Roberts.  But we do need to focus on a million different names.  No.  So we need a sacrificial lamb. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  You're the representative.  You're the representative.  You're the poster.  You're the face of what's going on here, which is apparently unshaven and racial confusion.  I also like to keep track of where Sam's raise is going.  Yeah.  And they're still doing the phone-in show for $1,000 a day, right?  Oh.  No, no.  Yeah, it's once a week.  Oh.  And every Thursday at 1 p.m., they do the phone show, and somebody wins $1,000.  That's $52,000.  That's what it is.  They're going to blow in a year. 
[00:26:30]  Wow.  So all they have to do is blow off that dumb fucking idea, because no one's going to listen  longer, because they're giving away $1,000.  And that's your raise right there.  I mean, that would work for me, but then Sterniolo's out of job, huh?  No, you can still take phone calls.  Well, it's $1,000 a week, $52,000 a week.  So they could just give Sam his raise, and then just do that contest for 51 and a half  weeks.  Right.  I mean, based on percentages, that would still be a high raise.  Of course it would.  And then the other thing is, I believe, I've heard, we have spent up to, up to, oh, wait, 
[00:27:00]  maybe we didn't spend this, so maybe I should shut my fucking mouth.  Guy Fieri's coming in to cook for us.  Oh, yeah.  I've heard rumors that we may have thrown a bunch of money at the fact that he's cooking  for us today.  That could have been your raise as well.  Wait.  I don't even eat steak.  That sucks.  Oh, steak is great.  You're eating steak today.  You ate steak once.  I remember, I saw it.  You're eating steak today.  You're going to eat shit when you walk into management's office.  Well, she might well have some steak.  Who threw money at it?  We did? 
[00:27:30]  I don't know.  Oh.  Now I'm not really sure, so I really should shut up.  I try to keep it with the facts.  Well, you got a mic in front of you.  I know.  All right.  Yeah.  We spent $5,000 to $6,000 on the fact here today.  Are you kidding me?  Whatever you say is true.  You got a mic.  All right.  Fair enough.  So there you go.  Well, it's an exciting day for me, too.  I have a lot to look forward to.  Yeah.  So do we.  I'm going to miss Sam.  Give him hell.  That's what I say.  I have a feeling that these raised status meetings will start getting a lot shorter. 
[00:28:00]  There was some friendly small talk before.  That's not happening anymore.  Yeah, because they don't like when the attention is put on them.  No.  It's so weird.  You work for a show like this, and you don't like the attention.  Yeah.  It just goes hand in hand.  These guys should have done that.  It is odd.  They should have done their research before they signed on to be part of the Opinant Anthony  party regime.  I think the prerequisite for being involved in this show in any capacity is a complete 
[00:28:30]  understanding of the show.  Right.  Yeah.  That comes in handy.  Yeah.  You're saying that maybe a few of them don't have an understanding of it?  A few?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  A few.  Do your time.  Get beat up.  And then eventually you walk past us in the hall and make believe you never worked with  us like some people around here.  Yeah.  I know what you're talking about.  It's great.  Jesus Christ.  Are you kidding me?  The only reason you got that cushy fucking office and that nice job is because of us. 
[00:29:00]  Narrowing it down.  Right.  No one knew who the fuck he was before.  He worked with us.  Someone on vacation.  Who, Sam?  You know who.  I mean, that's accurate, too.  Is someone on vacation?  Who's on vacation?  Yes.  Who's on vacation?  Gary.  Oh, right.  Was that brought up earlier or something?  Yes.  Because I just haven't noticed any difference in the show.  Any difference in anything that happens with the show?  I'm thinking they could get rid of his salary and give it to you.  I'm kind of thinking there's some.  I know what he's thinking.  I would accept it, but I don't think, you know, I don't want to see the guy lose his gig. 
[00:29:30]  He's a good guy.  Well, you never want to see anyone lose their gig.  But when you look around and you realize, like, oh, there's nothing different today  than there was when he was not on vacation.  We've been gone all week, not just today.  What?  All week, right?  As in Monday, Tuesday, now today?  Right.  This would be the third day, yeah.  So three days have gone by.  We've been on the air.  Yes.  We've had fun. 
[00:30:00]  We've had shows.  We've had guests.  Great shows, actually.  I'll say that.  Great shows.  I'm amazed at the complete lack of anything different that's going on since he's been  gone.  Can I ask you an honest question, Ant?  Let's say he just was gone.  Just say it.  Died.  You were going to say died.  Let's just say he left.  Let's say he just has a, how about we go with a nervous breakdown and he never comes back?  That's a viable one.  How long would it fucking take for us to either notice or the show to suffer?  And be honest. 
[00:30:30]  I'll be honest.  And this is just me.  Step out of the box.  Because I know a lot of people.  Because we like to do bits and have a little bit of a conversation about myself because  I know me.  I wouldn't notice.  And I'm being completely honest with you.  I wouldn't ever notice.  For the remainder of your contract.  I would have assumed that.  Yeah, let's go with that.  We've got 14 months left on our contract.  Yes.  You would not notice a difference.  I really wouldn't notice not only a difference. 
[00:31:00]  I wouldn't even notice.  I wouldn't think like, where did he go?  I would just assume that he's in an office somewhere.  I don't know.  I'm with you.  But I don't think.  I'm completely with Anthony on this.  I don't think this show would change one iota in his absence.  In the end, we help management.  They never help us.  Right.  We push them forward and their careers get better for some reason.  Because they're able to go to their bosses and say things like, well, what'd you do? 
[00:31:30]  Well, the Opie and Anthony show.  I contributed this, this.  I'm doing this.  We're working on this.  But in the meantime.  What company does that help?  I was with the Opie and Anthony until they got fired.  And then I was in.  Yeah, and then this.  But that's what I'm getting at.  The guy that went down with us is now a fucking bigwig here at SiriusXM.  A giant wig.  Big wigs.  He parlayed that into a better fucking position for him in his career. 
[00:32:00]  And now he sees us and he could barely fucking raise his hand to say hi.  I mean, barely.  And I know it hurts.  He doesn't even want to do that anymore.  Oh, boy.  Well, he raises his head.  Oh, boy.  Do you want someone to look where they're going?  Of course.  Anyway.  Guys, we got Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman coming in today from the movie The Change-Up.  Big stars.  One of those switcheroo movies that I ended up seeing.  You were supposed to go, Jimmy.  I was working.  I was 6.30.  It was too late to screening.  If they give us copies, I'd watch it. 
[00:32:30]  But 6.30 on a Monday, I couldn't do.  Yes, I like the home screening.  Yeah.  It's nice.  And I did like this movie.  I did like it.  It was edgy.  Comedies are starting to get a little more edgy.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank the Lord.  Not extremely edgy.  But a little more edgy than we're used to seeing in our comedies lately.  And honestly, they had a lot of fucking nudity.  Yeah?  That's a good thing to bring back to movies.  What's his name's wife is in this movie?  The redhead?  She's in a porn star. 
[00:33:00]  Has she been in anything else, this taffy girl?  Oh, God.  I like those lips.  You don't like those lips.  Yes, I do.  Big collagen fucking lips.  Yes, those are.  Terrible.  You ever feel collagen lips on your dick?  They're like two wet pillows.  It's like somebody fucking dipped two pillows in fucking warm Vaseline and rubs it on your dick.  Pillow dick, pillow dick.  Who doesn't like that?  Iraq told me she's done B movies.  Like what?  Any movies we've seen?  No, but it's all those ones you would see like on USA Up All Night where the girl just gets naked and killed at the same time. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, right.  That's great.  It also worked very sporadically.  Very sporadically, yeah.  Very sporadically.  Like in 2011, 2010, 2003, 96, 91, 89, 84.  That must suck.  Boy, she goes back away.  She was on an episode of Knight Rider.  Oh, no.  So she's in the movie.  And then you got this Olivia Wilde who could be the hottest fucking...  Laverne and Shirley, Archie Bunker's Place.  Wow.  Who was on Laverne and Shirley and Archie Bunker's Place? 
[00:34:00]  This lady?  She was, yeah.  Who'd she play?  I don't know.  Who was she on Archie Bunker's Place?  She the one Archie fucked behind the bar after Edith croaked?  Do a Google image with her so we can see older pictures.  So we can see older pictures to see if we recognize her before all the face work.  Three's Company.  She was in all those shows in like one episode of each one of these.  So she was...  She was just one of those...  Walk-on.  ...trot around Hollywood and...  That's her?  Oh, that's her right there.  That's her?  Yeah, she was hot. 
[00:34:30]  What the fuck did she do to her face?  She was hot back in what they call the day.  Well, no.  Go back to the other one.  Show Jimmy.  Is that from Columbo?  Look how hot she used to be.  Holy shit.  That's the same book?  She looks like Bo Derrick a little bit.  Maybe a teeny bit heavier than Bo Derrick.  She has that 70s blonde bombshell look to her.  Definitely a Charlie's Angels-ish look.  Wow-wee.  And then she fucking did that to her face.  Nice tits, too.  You know, those are all right.  I mean, they're horrendous in this movie, Change-Up.  That's before they were fixed, probably, all right? 
[00:35:00]  Nice big, real, heavy tits.  She loves getting naked.  Yeah.  You know you're going to see a good movie when they show tits, though.  You know what I mean?  For a while, they got rid of the whole, you know, tits shot.  Yeah.  Every movie used to have a tits shot, remember?  Oh, yeah.  At least.  Even a lot of the Disney movies, they said, all right.  Put tits in there.  You got to do a tits shot.  You should see a lot of full frontal back in those days.  And now this girl, Olivia Wilde.  Holy shit, is she hot.  Yeah.  She's in Change-Up as well.  I wouldn't mind giving her the old... 
[00:35:30]  Could you Google image Olivia Wilde?  You got to get one with her eyes.  Her eyes are ridiculous.  Look how hot this girl is.  That's a good one.  What else has she been in?  I know the name.  I don't know her face.  She was in House?  Oh.  The show?  House?  Yeah.  I didn't watch that dumb show.  Would she have a fucking anal parasite?  The house had a fish out with its tongue?  I hate that show.  Look how hot she is. 
[00:36:00]  This stupid character choice of limping.  Oh, of course.  And she gets relatively naked.  Wow.  That's nice right there.  Yeah.  She's just in Tron, I think.  She's in Tron.  She was on the OC.  And then there's another...  The OC.  And then there's another horrific nude scene in this movie.  I don't want to give it away, but I'll tell you guys this way.  Nude scene.  Woman.  Oh, really?  Completely naked.  Wow.  Yes. 
[00:36:30]  Did you get all turned on?  I don't know if I'm into that fetish anymore.  Oh, well.  I think becoming a father has changed that fetish.  Oh, has it?  I don't know.  Good.  For people that don't know, I used to be into pregnant women.  Is that bitch in there, too?  I didn't bang pregnant women, but there's something.  Is she in this?  Yes.  She is?  Oh, I know her.  I don't remember seeing her.  She looks like a young Heather Graham.  Oh, yes, she is.  Or Sia Monroe.  She's the one that's...  Oh, really?  Completely nude. 
[00:37:00]  Interesting.  I guess we sort of gave it away.  Whatever.  I'm sorry.  Interesting.  But I did like the change-up.  And Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds are coming in.  Did some good kid shit in that movie.  And being a father fucking made me howl.  Oh, I thought you meant the other.  Uncle Paul would have enjoyed it.  Hey!  Yay!  I wish we could get copies of these to watch, because I would like to see the movies.  Yeah.  They don't schedule a screenings at a good time.  Wait.  How about 1040 in the morning?  It'd be a great time. 
[00:37:30]  Listen to this.  Brendan in California.  Brendan.  Yeah.  Olivia Wilde's nipples weren't actually in that film.  They had to digitally alter it and add nipples onto her.  She refused to do full topless.  Isn't that weird, though?  Because if you're looking at this, you're like, okay, Olivia Wilde is topless.  Yeah, so it doesn't matter.  So you change out the nipples, and then what?  She's okay with it?  She's able to go home with her.  Huh?  Maybe they didn't give her a choice.  Maybe they didn't mention that, and they just did it like that?  Maybe the producers are like, you know what? 
[00:38:00]  Can we fucking pump up her nipples a little bit?  This chick is hot, but her nipples are a little shaky.  I hate chicks that won't show their tits.  In life and in movies.  Yeah.  It's like, if the role calls for you to be topless, just don't take the role if you're  not going to be topless, and they should just go, we're not going to hire you if you  won't show your fucking tits.  That pregnant movie that everyone loved, what the fuck was it called?  Knock Up?  Knocked Up.  Knocked Up.  That drove me nuts that she wasn't topless in the sex scenes.  What girl is that?  It was, what's her name?  Catherine Heigl.  Yeah, Heigl. 
[00:38:30]  She stinks anyway.  She's doing all her sex scenes in a bra.  That's not real life.  No.  So get an actress that will show some boobs.  Absolutely.  Some tittage.  All right, so they replaced her nipples.  Also, Ryan Reynolds gives it away that there is a naked pregnant chick in this movie.  Okay.  Oh, okay.  So we can't say it.  I was just trying to save it for maybe the people that are going to go see the movie.  Speaking of big jugs, I guess TMZ is posting some brand new pictures from a 
[00:39:00]  Ohio of Casey Anthony.  Casey Anthony in Ohio, trying to be incognito with an Ohio State hat on.  Look at the size of her tits.  Did she get a boob job?  No.  No, she just always had big tits, but she wore stuff to tame them down in court.  Wow.  But she's got them.  And she's a little sloppy and everything.  I dig that.  Yeah, I do.  I like her.  I think a lot of guys dig that.  I like that.  They weren't big from nursing or nurturing, you know that.  Oh, yeah.  No, no.  That's it.  Yeah.  It doesn't always have to be polished. 
[00:39:30]  What part of Ohio?  I'm not sure.  I'm going to guess Cleveland.  Yeah, probably Cleveland.  She probably likes a lot of big black dick in Cleveland.  Fucking chicks in Cleveland.  See?  She's just walking around.  She's got her Starbucks.  She's shopping at the Gap.  She's just living the life of Riley there.  Life of Riley.  That's unbelievable.  Yeah, amazing.  What a cunt.  She looks good, though.  Boy, being out of court has helped her.  That fucking court just blew it. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, prison-like really fucking got her all haggard.  But she's looking good these days.  Walking around in the fresh air.  Look at that, right?  See?  Wow.  Yeah.  She's a fucking duct-taped two-year-old in a fucking trunk.  Her lawyers are fighting.  They want to bring her back to Orlando to serve a year's probation because she had that  check fraud thing.  So they want to bring her back and make her at least stay in the state.  But I'm sure the lawyers are going to argue that she'd be in danger and this and that. 
[00:40:30]  They'll probably let her off the hook for that one.  Why should they?  Because she'd be in danger.  So what?  She looks nice.  Look at her with the big tits.  All right.  Fair enough.  I'm convinced.  What are you going to do?  The kid's gone.  What are you going to do?  That's true.  It's not like the kid was going to come back if she's not there or there.  Right.  Fair point.  Right.  I was being shallow.  I apologize.  You remember a movie called Alpha Dog?  Yeah.  I'm getting some intel that Olivia Wilde was naked in that. 
[00:41:00]  Do we have a Mr. Skin account still?  Oh, is she in there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe.  Maybe.  I didn't know much about Olivia Wilde until I saw this movie.  Alpha Dog.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  When she's having sex with it.  Wow.  Jesus.  Yeah.  There she goes.  She's got some nice little boobies on her there.  Little boobies nice, right?  Yeah, sure.  I don't need tit monsters anymore in my life.  It's a variety thing.  I started my life all about the big boobies.  All about fucking big bodacious women. 
[00:41:30]  Women.  Then you realize that women have a lot more parts.  Yeah.  They're really sexy.  I'd say two more.  Two?  Yeah.  I mean, more.  You got the ass.  You got this area right here.  And that's your hope's pointing to where his V starts.  It's the size.  I don't have a fucking V.  You do?  Jesus.  I never had a V.  You've always had a V.  I never had a V.  Everyone sees it.  These fucking listeners kill me every time.  It's a nice V.  They all look immediately at my fucking gut. 
[00:42:00]  I'm like, yeah, this is how I always was.  I don't see a gut.  I see a V.  I don't have a V.  Is it chiseled?  It's like cliffs of skin.  Skin cliffs.  Even when I was 13, 14, 15, I never saw my abs.  I've never seen my abs.  I want to go on record finally.  I've never had a V, and I've never seen abs.  Okay?  I've come close.  After a lot of working out and dieting, and guess what?  They're still...  Wasn't there?  No! 
[00:42:30]  You fucked Jimmy.  Because everybody now just, their eyes go right down.  Yes.  Well, my eyes stay the whole show.  What should everybody enjoy?  And then I hear him whispering, oh boy, he sure let himself go.  What happened to that delicious V that Jimmy talks about?  They're a letter off.  That's a U.  Yeah, exactly.  It's a W.  Oh, that.  Oh, that would be awkward.  Anthony, she's also in Cowboys and Aliens.  Cowboys and Aliens.  I'm not giving up on this Olivia Wilde.  I think we might be able to get her on the show if we do well with Ryan Reynolds and Jason 
[00:43:00]  Bateman today.  Well, we'll see if we don't fuck that up.  And any Arrested Development fans here?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you ever get into that show?  Yeah.  I wasn't totally immersed, but any episodes that I did see, I thought were very funny.  And I guess they're working on a movie, so hopefully we could ask Jason Bateman about  that.  We'll ask him about that one.  A lot of people want to know about that.  And I want to know what his sister's up to.  She was the big star in the family.  The big star.  That is an odd kind of sibling rivalry thing that was going on at the time.  And she was like... 
[00:43:30]  She was way bigger than Jason Bateman.  But wasn't he in the Hogan family?  Yeah.  I want to ask what he thought when fucking Rhoda left, too.  If he wanted to bash her in the fucking head.  They had a hit show going and Rhoda left.  And then they brought on that one-eyed fucking...  Wait, what show?  The Hogan family.  It was called Valerie at Fresca.  It was called Valerie at Fresca.  And they killed her off because she wanted to leave.  She wanted to leave.  So they killed her off, burnt down the house, changed it to the Hogan family, and brought  in Sandy Duncan.  And brought in Sandy Duncan.  Oh, I thought you were...  And the show actually did great with Sandy Duncan in it. 
[00:44:00]  I thought you were...  I thought he was part of the Hulkster family.  That's what I thought.  I was like, what?  No, I didn't.  I really did.  The Hogan family.  I didn't recognize him.  Let me tell you, brother.  Rent a center.  Really?  Things going well, Hogan?  Hogan!  Yeah, Hogan's heroes.  These are my heroes, brother.  Get that little French guy out there.  What did Jason Bateman do after that?  Because this is what happened.  Justine Bateman was fucking huge.  Jason was sort of down here.  And they've switched. 
[00:44:30]  Jason Bateman's in every movie now.  She was big in Family Ties.  Yep.  And then he was big in Arrested Development.  But I don't think in between.  I'm sure he was working.  How about Teen Wolf 2?  Family Ties, by the way.  The father was in last week's episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm.  He was.  As a doctor.  Oh.  All gray.  Not looking old, though.  The father in Family Ties?  Michael Gross, his name was.  Michael Gross.  He was in the last episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm.  Curb Your Enthusiasm is having a great fucking season, by the way. 
[00:45:00]  Is it good?  I think so.  They're really getting sick with it and disturbing to watch.  I tweeted last night.  A miracle happened, too.  A whole episode without Suzy Essman yelling at Larry David.  I don't think that's ever happened before.  That's good.  So they're going into some different areas, finally.  That's nice.  Although she had to yell at her husband last night.  Well.  I'm looking for one episode where she doesn't yell at all.  That's all.  That's all.  That's her gimmick.  I like her, too.  I think she's a funny lady. 
[00:45:30]  Funny in general.  Know who else was on the episode last night?  I mean, I'm behind, but I watched it last night.  Yeah.  Joanne Worley.  Joanne Worley.  And I was trying.  From Ronan Martin's Laugh-In.  Thank you.  I was telling my girl.  I'm like, she's from Laugh-In.  And what else?  Wasn't she on the original Dick Van Dyke show, Ant?  I don't know.  I remember a couple of episodes of Love American Style, maybe.  Oh, fuck you.  Okay.  Love, love, love.  There she is.  Oh, she used to do that.  Oh, God.  Why did we laugh at shit like that?  Did she put the finger in the cheek? 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, she'd put a finger in the cheek like a dimple, twist it around and go, oh.  How do you remember that?  I remember her name, but you remember, like, specifics.  Because this was the good times that I had to remember while the belt was hanging on  the door, waiting to be beaten with it for laughing too hard, listening to Laugh-In as  it's blasting out my parents' arguing.  And the reason people laughed is because the other option was to turn on the news and look  at Vietnam soldiers being brought back.  Yes.  There wasn't a lot of options.  That is true. 
[00:46:30]  In a body bag.  Poor Anthony.  You laughed too loud?  You got beat up?  Well, yeah, they're just like, knock it out, quiet in there.  Fuck, shut up.  There was always some yelling.  Oh, yelling.  Maybe that's why I yell all the time.  You're brought up in yelling.  You yell a lot.  Oh.  Fuck you.  Yelling.  I've been in a tizzy for a week because I hung out with my brother who owns F.H.  Riley's in the heart of Huntington Village.  Yeah.  Chilling out.  Cheat. 
[00:47:00]  He had a little fire in his backyard that he set so he could hang around and drink beers.  And then he brought up memories of our childhood.  Shit, I blocked out.  I'm like, fuck, I got to go back to fucking therapy now.  You blocked stuff out, really?  I guess.  Because he was telling me stuff that was horrific.  I'm like, I don't fucking remember that.  Like beatings?  Yeah.  Oh.  That you took or saw?  I don't think I really got...  I took a few wooden spoons to the back of my thighs, but I don't remember really getting 
[00:47:30]  beat up, to be honest with you.  Sexy.  Because I chose to be the perfect child so I would stay out of the shit.  A roll I didn't want to do, by the way.  So you saw beatings?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe some oatmeal being poured over someone's head.  Hot oatmeal?  Oh, yeah.  Ugh.  Wow.  Wow.  And kids being arrested.  Oh, yeah.  What?  Yeah.  Kids being arrested. 
[00:48:00]  I've been in a tizzy ever since.  Why?  Are you remembering it all?  Well, it brought back some fucking memories.  Now I got to fucking go back to that lady.  Fuck.  You never should have stopped going.  It's always good when things are good.  No, I don't need to be the guy that goes every week.  You do.  No, I don't.  I'm telling you, it's good.  I'm in a different fucking place.  Yeah, but it's okay to be going.  I got to be in a good place.  I got to go back for a while, but my stupid brother, fuck you.  I mean that lovingly.  He's listening to us right now as he goes fishing. 
[00:48:30]  I really didn't need to remember that.  Yeah, man.  You do, though, because it's always there.  It's like when there's something in a room, you close the door, there's an odor.  It's like you got to get rid of it or the fucking odor is always going to be there.  Just plaster it down and spray some Febreze.  Push it down deep.  That's what we do, but then it seeps.  It seeps.  But then Ant's saying that he gets in trouble for laughing too hard as a kid.  I just remember.  We're just fucking kids, man.  What the fuck?  Parents just were stupid back then.  Parents suck.  They didn't get it. 
[00:49:00]  Huh?  They just didn't get it back then.  You don't think?  Yeah.  They just wanted order in their house.  Yeah.  I mean, I think a good whacking on the ass with a belt, that works.  Oh, boy, did I not fucking yap after that.  But it might do some damage.  What about a wooden spoon to the back of the thighs?  That'll hurt.  How about a Hot Wheels track?  You got Hot Wheels tracks?  For real?  Yeah.  We used to beat the shit out of each other with Hot Wheels tracks.  Hot Wheels tracks.  But that wasn't fun.  You could fucking make a nice weapon. 
[00:49:30]  Remember, you would make it really long so it was a whip?  Yeah, that would hurt.  Did you get soap in the mouth?  No, nothing.  I got that.  You got soap and wash the cum out?  That's funny.  It's almost got to go there.  That's still funny.  I got them scraped on my teeth.  Ah, fuck.  For what?  Cursing?  I told you I was showing off to one of my friends, and I was yelling into my front window. 
[00:50:00]  All those, Edison, all the curses.  I was like, fuck, piss, shit.  This is your dick reporting.  I was probably in third or second grade.  Oh, no.  Because my parents weren't home.  No one was home.  Oh, no.  And I'm yelling all these curses, and then I heard, uh, hold on.  This is what I, wait.  I'll tell you exactly what I heard, and I remember it as if it happened yesterday.  Oh.  And I realized that my fucking bedroom door, which was the back door, had been open, and 
[00:50:30]  my parents had walked in the house from the back.  Oh, no.  So they heard my entire tirade.  That's just that sound.  Oh, boy.  And, um, I just ran around the corner and got horrible soap in the mouth.  Oh.  It's a horrible thing when you have to sit there and get soap scrapped against your teeth.  Yeah, that never comes out, right?  I didn't understand that that's not, um, that's not a good thing.  I never yell, this is your dick reporting into the window again, though.  No.  There was something to be said for fucking...  No.  Certain lessons. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  I...  Now it's Geraldo's line.  I'm just having a...  He stinks.  To be, like, serious for a moment, now that I'm a father, like, and seeing the innocence  of a child has brought up way to a lot of shit.  Like, I don't understand how anyone could, like, mistreat a child.  I just don't fucking understand.  Yeah, sometimes they get loud.  Huh?  Sometimes they get loud.  Yeah.  I forgot.  Anton's like being serious.  I'm sorry.  I'll shut up now. 
[00:51:30]  Sometimes they get loud.  But people who mistreat kids aren't healthy anyway.  They're not normal people.  Oh, I know.  I don't have kids.  I can't understand it.  I don't understand...  Like, I know stuff that happened to me growing up, and I'm like, I can't even imagine that  I would do it to my own kid.  But then there's always that cycle.  So, like, you know, shit happened to my mom, so she did it to us.  But I can't imagine I would do any of that shit.  I just can't imagine it.  Yeah, I don't know about that cycle thing where if something happened to you, you're definitely  gonna...  Oh, I don't think it's definite. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  I don't think that's true.  You're more than likely to.  Sure.  More than likely to, but I don't think it's a given.  And I think sometimes it works in the opposite, where you're just like, there's no way I  could do that.  I'm uber aware.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Of the signs and things, little things.  And I just can't imagine it, man.  Women that get beat up always marry husbands that beat them.  Or women who watch their mother get hit, they fucking always look for it.  It's like a weird...  Yeah, exactly.  What would we do without it?  I'm proud to say I didn't fucking marry my mother. 
[00:52:30]  Thank God.  Oh.  I went out with some...  Weird.  I went out with some fucking...  Yeah.  I fucked a bunch of my moms, but I married one.  I absolutely went out with people that were like my mom and realized that shit and said,  what are you fucking doing?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  I absolutely broke that fucking cycle.  Wow.  The person that needed all the fucking attention and enabling, sacrifice your own fucking life  for another person.  Trust me, I broke that fucking chain. 
[00:53:00]  It's the worst, isn't it?  Holy shit.  Enough already.  Yeah, because we're sitting around.  I'm old, dude.  We make believe we're young in the show.  I'm a fucking old guy now.  And I'm sitting around with my brother around a fire having beers on a nice Saturday night  and my kid's running around and we're still talking about my mom.  She still fucking is the center of attention.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Enough already.  I even said...  Because I shut down and then the rest of the weekend I was like, ugh.  And then I was able to get my brother on the phone.  I'm like, look, we got to make a deal.  Next time we're together, let's talk about fishing and anything else. 
[00:53:30]  Enough already.  She still gets our fucking attention.  Does he resent her?  Yeah.  Of course.  He was down in Florida and got arrested because he threatened her on the phone because she...  I don't know.  She was carrying on about something.  So obviously he was like, I'll fucking kill you or something.  But he's in Florida.  And he moved to Florida to get away from all this.  And she called the cops?  Next thing you know, there was a sheriff at the door because he threatened her. 
[00:54:00]  It was one of those fake threats.  Then he had to go to court.  Then he had to come up to New York and face the charges.  And then he got in trouble because he didn't stop by and visit while he was up from Florida.  And my brother's like, I'm up here because you had me arrested.  I got a fucking answer to the charges.  Sorry that I'm not visiting you guys.  Wow.  It's weird though when people are fucked up how... 
[00:54:30]  I guess family's a little different, but people never just cut them off.  It's hard to just cut people off completely and go, you're done.  Nothing else with you at all.  It's hard to do that.  It's, I'm amazed, oh boy, I got it way too deep today probably.  Fuck.  Why?  It's interesting.  I'll just say this.  I'm amazed that any of us talk to my mom.  I'm amazed.  I'm amazed.  She probably doesn't deserve it.  It's very weird how it's like with people who you work with or your family, you know,  go to school with, you know, casually.  It's, I guess, a little easier with family. 
[00:55:00]  You can't just fucking...  Yeah.  You can't just completely cut them off.  Just amazed by it.  But sometimes, it's almost weird like when you get someone who's so fucked up and then  all of a sudden that person is not there anymore.  There is something missing.  It's like I've had circumstances with certain girls where there's a problem and I found that  I wanted that negativity to keep going, that relationship to keep going because without  it, there was something missing.  There was something to fucking push back again. 
[00:55:30]  It was really weird.  You miss certain things even if they're fucking horrible.  I gave up three or four years playing the game because I know exactly what you're talking  about.  I'd get right in there with the arguments and this and that and play her game and then  the weird thing is as soon as I stopped playing her game, the dynamics changed drastically.  That's the advice I would give anyone out there.  Right.  You know?  Don't engage it.  Don't engage it.  And you watch that person change.  That's a fact.  Sorry, Ant. 
[00:56:00]  But when you said that you got in trouble for laughing, I'm like, oh.  No, that's a mortish.  No, no.  That's, you know.  Did you really get in trouble for laughing too hard?  Well, when it's at night and I'm in bed and I'm supposed to be going to sleep and I'm  here and like laughing.  But you weren't sleeping so you could be fresh for your Wall Street job.  When I heard you bet your bippy, that made me laugh.  The fickle finger of fate award.  But you just wanted a good night's sleep so you could run around all day.  Yeah, yeah.  You had no responsibility.  That's cool tomorrow. 
[00:56:30]  Who gives a fuck?  Who cares?  Exactly.  He's going to fucking drop out anyway.  Well, your dad didn't know that.  He just knew you had dolls and he'd had enough.  They were puppets.  They weren't dolls.  They were puppets.  It was a marionette without strings yet.  Your dad just wanted to drink and smoke and he had a fucking kid playing with dolls, hooting  it up.  Did he ever?  Did he ever.  Me and Anna haven't really talked about this stuff off air, but the stuff we bring to the  air with our families.  Fuck, man.  I'm telling you, me and you are fucking similar with our upbringings. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, it's crazy.  So fucking similar.  I'm listening to you because I never had, I never, very rarely did I get hit.  Occasionally, but you know, I didn't have that much of that.  Yeah.  It was just when I really did fuck up.  That's what the victim always says.  We blame ourselves.  Yes, yes.  It was fun to listen to.  It was your fault.  I feel guilty because I know I didn't get hit that much, like the wooden spoon for dumb  shit, but there was some physical shit that went on in my house.  Now I feel guilty now that I'm older because I was, you know, the older brother.  I'm like, fuck, I wish I could have helped out. 
[00:57:30]  What do you got, like survivor's guilt?  I don't know.  I had no idea.  Well, I also left at 18 and said, I'm never coming back.  I came back for a few summers, but I knew I had to get the fuck out and start my life.  Yeah.  Once pops moved out to California, that shit ended.  And so by, you know, by 12, I wasn't getting smacked around or anything, you know, and  it wasn't really getting beaten all the time.  It was just the overhanging threat of it was always there.  Like, ah, ah, I'll smack you.  Shut up.  Shut the fuck up. 
[00:58:00]  Don't make me come in there.  Stop crying.  I'll give you a reason to cry.  Oh, that was always a good one.  Knock it off.  Quit.  What did he say?  Quit with the pissy eyes.  I'll give you a reason to pissy eyes.  Are you calling them pissy eyes?  Yeah, yeah.  If I was crying, he'd be like, knock it off with the pissy eyes.  I'll give you a reason to cry.  Oh, what?  Are you going to beat me till I cry?  Wait a minute.  But you did voices and stuff, obviously, when you were funny.  Oh, I was hilarious.  What did you do with all your, like, you're a radio guy. 
[00:58:30]  So like, what happened that made you be a radio?  Do you know what I mean?  Like, that's interesting shit.  Like, what happened that made you be a radio guy from all that shit?  Because it probably comes from all that shit.  The need to be heard or whatever it is.  I was always a silly guy at school and, you know, I don't know.  I was always a people watcher.  I don't know.  A people watcher.  Well, my mom does tell a, you know, a story when I, they brought us all in for the Thanksgiving  Day Parade.  This says a lot about the direction I went in. 
[00:59:00]  My whole family's watching the parade.  And they thought something was wrong with me because I had my fucking back to the parade.  I could give a fuck about the marching bands and shit.  And I was looking at all the people on the sidewalk.  I was like, this is fascinating to me.  You know, and it was old school New York.  So you had pimps and drug fucking addicts and homeless people and just general people  in general.  I was like, general people in general, whatever.  And I remember at the time going, this is way more interesting than this dumb, stupid  parade that everyone else is watching. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, turn around.  Yeah, I don't know.  I just, I, I, I, I, I, I played a role growing up as, you know, the good kid that did really  well in school and all that and didn't cause any problems.  You know, I wanted to act out like everybody else, but it wasn't worth the fucking bullshit  at home.  Do you know what?  So then when I went to college, I went fucking hog wild.  I went nuts.  Hog wild.  It's only fatties.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The entertainers are always fucking, like, it always comes from a weird place.  I think I had an argument with a comic one time.  Cause I'm like, I think it's a, it's, it's a need for attention. 
[01:00:00]  Meaning us, all of us.  Right.  Uh, she's like, no, I just love to, I'm like, yeah, I know you love to, but the need for  attention is what makes it.  So I'm always interested as to what makes people fucking get into this.  Well, I think you make a point.  I mean, uh, I like the rest of us in this room, we liked the attention of course.  And I certainly didn't get the attention growing up.  Cause all the, I mean, all the attention was put on my mom, all of it.  Yeah.  All of it.  So I'm sure that played into my head a little bit and got me into a field where I may  get into something where someone pays attention to me.  I don't know. 
[01:00:30]  I do want to say this though.  I'm not doing a woe is me.  Fuck that.  I bring this shit up cause I know people can relate.  And that is it.  I'm not one of those fucking woe is me guys anymore.  No fucking way.  And I want you to know that out there.  Cause I mean, people all want to talk down the instant feedback and the Twitter.  It's ridiculous.  Don't do the woe is me.  I'm fine.  You know what?  I'm working on my shit.  I hate to bring this up.  And my life is great, by the way.  I hate to bring this up.  We got to take a break.  Well, aren't the, are there 725? 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  We should take a break.  And we should, we, I don't want to be shoving food in my mouth.  Honestly, enough of this shit anyway, you know, in small doses, it's  good, but no, it's always good.  Don't do the woe is me.  Cause that's not why I brought this up.  I'm, I'm fucking fine.  How long do we have these guys for?  Only about a half hour.  So up next, we got Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds from the changeup.  From O&A Pictures comes a true story of one man's pain.  It does hurt.  And a family torn apart.  And it makes you feel really funny right after it happens. 
[01:01:30]  The War of the Kumias.  I had the yelling parents too growing up until they got divorced and it was just, you know.  And then you'd see like the old man and you'd take the plate full of spaghetti and throw it  and it would hit like the wall next to the phone.  And you're sitting there horrified, watching the spaghetti slowly go down the wall.  Fuck you, get the fuck out of the wall, fuck you.  Oh, and the horrified kids just sitting there.  Did dad actually leave after the fights?  Yeah, a lot of times, sure.  And then, you know, you'd be able to go to sleep because the yelling would stop. 
[01:02:00]  First mom would have to wind down a little.  That fucking asshole.  You know, even after dad left, she's still going.  Eat that shit like I need a fucking hole in the head.  I'm trying to sleep.  He's gone.  Son of a bitch.  Shut up.  Come in here.  Shut up.  That way.  That's it.  Oh, God.  He's been gone a half hour.  When would he come back?  The next day?  Yeah, like the next day.  You know, they'd be sitting down watching like Ronan Martin's laughing.  Laughing.  Everything was fine.  You know, and then out of nowhere, you'd hear the rumbling.  You'd be in bed and you'd be like,  And then you'd hear from the kids' room. 
[01:02:30]  Can't you two just shut the fuck up for like one night?  And then we were pretty young.  So, you know, we got, you know, called into the room and mom sits down and goes,  Me and your father, I want you to know, and I want you to know it has nothing to do with you.  We're divorced.  Oh, okay.  Could I go out and play now?  How is this going to change my life? 
[01:03:00]  Does this mean I don't have to listen to...  Oh, it does?  Okay.  So, it's a good thing.  Great.  Well, thank you for staying together for so long and really, like, torturing us.  You couldn't have pulled this one like five years ago?  Yeah, fucking asshole.  Well, maybe we couldn't remember as much and didn't have to listen to the yelling and screaming.  No way.  Here's an idea, Pop.  There you go.  Right back into the Huntington boat ramp.  Give that a whirl.  The War of the Cummias. 
[01:03:30]  You've got to figure you're going to just sit there disgusted having to listen to this crap.  The Virus.  Sirius XM.  On the next episode of American Fuckers, Mike and Frank travel the back roads of America looking for rusty gold.  We are, man.  We're in the mantiques.  We're making rust hot.  Me and Frankie are the rock stars of rust.  They're looking for amazing antiques to fuck buried in people's garages and barns.  What happens is you get in these barns and stuff and I'll f*** anything that's transportation related.  I'll f*** a 1913 Indian in a barn. 
[01:04:00]  I'll f*** a 1913 Harley in a barn.  Yeah, it's hard to really get the boner on.  Yeah, that's hard to f***, you know what I mean?  What most people see as junk, they try and stick their dicks into.  Oil cans, gas pumps.  Everything.  Different heights, sizes, shapes, everything.  Four wheels, two wheels, you know, memorabilia.  Beer cans.  That was smoking, man.  I did high-five them.  I was like, dude, that was awesome.  You can't just be a one-trick pony.  I mean, we've got a f*** a lot of different things.  You know, all of a sudden, Brass Blade fans are hot.  I love Brass Blade fans.  I want a dry hump of Brass Blade fans. 
[01:04:30]  They're f***ing the history of America one piece at a time.  You know, nothing surprises us anymore, I don't think.  We're f***ing cool stuff.  The cool thing about us is, you know, we get excited about just about anything.  You know, we're just looking for stuff we have never f***ed before.  Find out which forgotten relics will get f***ed.  Yeah!  Woo!  Woo!  All on the next episode of American Fuckers.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents Primetime Sam Roberts and One Question with a Guest We Couldn't Get. 
[01:05:00]  Television star and one-time heartthrob, Jason Priestley.  Primetime Sam Roberts here with Jason Priestley.  Jason, what type of fuel does your car take?  My car takes premium unleaded.  Thank you so much for your time.  All right, you bet.  This has been Primetime Sam Roberts and One Question with a Guest We Couldn't Get on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:05:30]  If you've got nothing better to do right now, why don't you call the show?  866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Any Wings fans?  Any reason for this song?  I'm sure there is.  Is there an anniversary of some sort or somebody's birthday?  I mean, it's pretty amazing that Paul McCartney goes from the Beatles to Wings. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  They had a ton of f***ing hits.  Big hits.  Paul McCartney formed Wings 40 years ago today.  That was the band he formed after the Beatles.  I, I, I.  It's just unbelievable.  This is Jed, right?  Yeah.  We got Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman making their way down the long hallway.  They're very studly gentlemen.  Oh, I'll say.  Control yourself, Jimmy. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  Control yourself.  Oh.  I have a gas are brewing.  No, no, no.  Don't do that.  I have a gas are brewing.  Hey, Jason.  Ryan, how are you guys?  We can speak a little bit of this.  Yeah, we're on the air already.  We just do that.  Hello.  I feel like I know these guys because I see them on, on the big screen.  What's up, Jason?  Ryan?  Hi.  Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton.  And Jimmy.  The incomparable Jim Norton.  And you guys are promoting The Change-Up in theaters Friday.  I saw the movie.  We're going to try.  It's too early to promote. 
[01:07:00]  Without going into an expletive-laden shame spiral.  Yeah.  You can do that, though.  It's too early for you, isn't it?  No, no, no, no.  I mean, try.  You know, it's just, it's a, we're finding that it's a little bit of an uphill battle here  with this concept of body switching.  And I get it because Ryan and I rolled our eyes at about the same time, although we weren't  sitting together when we read the script, but I could feel him in space.  Yes.  We're like, oh, really?  Do we need another body switching? 
[01:07:30]  But, this thing is, this thing is done the R-rated way, which they haven't done yet.  They haven't, yeah.  Yeah, and it's, because you're going to get into some R-rated situations.  If you, I mean, if you two switch bodies, well, this is a different story.  Well, I don't know if I can handle the alcohol, sir.  Well, that is true, yeah.  I don't know if he wants to handle the rollerblading, so.  I would like to have your liver.  Yeah.  That would be nice.  You know, I'm glad you brought that up, because when this movie first hit The Change-Up,  we said exactly that.  We're like, another movie where the guy switched roles.  We've seen this movie a million times, but then I saw the movie, and I laughed my ass 
[01:08:00]  off, because you went with the edgy stuff.  Well, that's what's going to happen if you switch bodies, right?  I mean, you're going to take full advantage, unless you're an idiot.  Right.  I mean, you're going to take full advantage of it.  Especially, yeah.  That's the problem with trying to do commercials for a movie like this, because you just can't,  there's about, I mean, for daytime television, there's about 44 seconds of usable footage.  That's what you can find.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why are comedies rated R now?  It's great that they're starting to do that, because they were PG for a long time to make  the money, but it's just not as funny when you can't, we don't have language freedom. 
[01:08:30]  I completely agree.  I bet maybe it's a guy selling tickets at theaters now, they're saying, screw it, they're  stopping checking ID, because, you know, the exhibitors are not making as much money  nowadays, so they're like, yeah, we'll take it.  You look 17, you 12-year-old.  Yeah, come on in.  I want to see an R-rated Madagascar movie.  That's what I want to say.  I want to see what would really happen when cartoon animals take over New York.  But it's refreshing that we're getting back to R-rated comedies, finally, because there  was a period there where you just didn't have them.  No.  You know, and we would talk about it on this show where the tit shot went away, and Change 
[01:09:00]  Up brought back the classic.  Every movie, remember, had one tit shot.  It could have been for two or three seconds, had nothing to do with the movie.  But you knew it was coming.  Even The Godfather.  That was what I told my mom when I read this script.  I was like, why are you going to do this one?  I was like, tit shots.  But it speaks to guys, you know?  Yeah.  Come on.  It does, sure.  There's some nudity in change, though.  It reminds me a bit of those movies I grew up with.  You know, when you grow up watching these R-rated comedies, you know, you actually get 
[01:09:30]  to see Animal House.  What were the ones you liked?  Animal House.  You know, I loved a lot of the 80s stuff.  Porky's.  Yeah, Porky.  Greatest Canadian movie ever made, guys.  Thank you.  Yeah, true.  You're welcome, America.  Was it really?  Yeah, it was.  Wow.  Didn't I know that?  But it's a sexy movie, but the most memorable scene is her grabbing his hog through the  wall and putting her foot up on the...  You found that sexy?  No, no, no.  Memorable.  Not sexy.  Let me rephrase that.  Yes.  Who hasn't been in that situation?  Please.  Who do you think would have the better side of it? 
[01:10:00]  The married guy with the wife or the single guy that's out, you know, carousing?  Who would have the better part?  I think the married guy with a week-long free pass, really.  I don't know.  I think the single guy, because then the single guy gets to jump into the married guy's world  and screw his wife that he's been looking at for a few years, which actually is played  with in this movie.  Yeah, yeah.  And then he'll go back and get back to his regulars when he pees back in the fountain 
[01:10:30]  again.  Maybe if you know you're going to go back to that.  You would have to know that there's also a return flight ticket.  Yeah, because if you're just stuck in a marriage, it would be kind of like, hmm.  Well, it's also, I mean, these guys, when they switch, it's virtually hell.  But, you know, if I had to choose, I'd probably take, see, the grass is always, I'm a single  guy, you're a married guy, I'd take you, I'd take the married guy, I'd, you know.  And he's been trying to nail my wife.  Oh, man.  What's up?  Hi, man, if you're listening.  Hi. 
[01:11:00]  That's got to suck, huh?  You know, because he kind of, you know, he's always on the cover of magazines, sexiest man  I'm sure, sure.  Things like that.  I wouldn't be mad at my girlfriend if she banged you.  I would just go, all right, just get him to sign something and I'll accept it.  Ryan's always got that.  It's all just another brick in my road to Amanda.  Yeah, the script was good, but she said, wait, Ryan's going to be in it?  You're doing this.  Right.  Yeah, that's just got to be one of those things.  I got to say, you guys pulled it off, though.  Absolutely.  You know, the kid humor is really good and edgy.  There's a Down syndrome joke in the fucking movie. 
[01:11:30]  I mean, what?  Hollywood doesn't go there anymore.  They don't do that.  I don't know if they ever did, really.  Yeah, I was shocked by that.  But it's done with charm.  There's a lot of charm to the edgy, holy shit moments.  Some of it's just the thing you're thinking and you're not allowed to say.  And I was talking around the movie earlier, but then someone said, Ryan, that you said  in an interview that there is a naked, pregnant girl, woman in the movie.  I was trying not to give that away, but you're giving away an interview, so...  Yeah, I'm an idiot.  So, hey, my God, I'm sure this is... 
[01:12:00]  Well, no, it's in the trailer.  And we don't see her in the trailer, but you say that she was nine months pregnant.  Yeah, she's quite...  Yeah, there's a...  I mean, you can see the baby's thoughts through that thin skin.  On one of the shots, you can see one of the baby's ankles.  Yeah.  It's going to be a real runner when it grows up, I think.  Yeah.  Real nice.  Nice.  Yeah.  What were you doing between, like, the Hogan family...  Coke.  And...  Oh, was it just Coke?  I was wondering. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, let's get to it.  Yeah.  Because, yeah, that was a huge hit.  And then it came out with Arrested Development.  There was some booze.  Was there a little bit of booze?  I'm not sure it went from Hogan's family to Arrested Development.  I don't think so, either.  There was some work in the middle of it.  But in our dumb minds, that's what we think sometimes, you know?  Yeah, the roof stayed over my head with some failed pilots, a couple of movies of the week. 
[01:13:00]  I never started moving weed, but I heard that was lucrative.  Yeah, yeah.  No.  But the thing is, to be able to go from a hit show like that, and then take some time where  you're not in a hit show...  I'm not trying to put down any careers.  No, he's attacking our guests.  I'm just saying.  And then have a huge show like that, too, that's critically acclaimed.  Yeah.  Things were great in the 80s.  They were normal in the 90s.  And then things got great again at Arrested Development.  I mean, that was really it.  I was basically doing the average working actor's career in the 90s, which was, you know, making 
[01:13:30]  a good living and working, you know, five, six, seven times a year.  And that's, unfortunately, that's the state of our business.  A lot of people are just sort of working a handful of times and getting the bills paid.  But Arrested Development really turned things around, obviously.  What a great show, by the way.  There's a movie going to be made, right?  Yeah.  It looks like we're going to do it as long as they can make the guy's deal, who's boss.  You know, he's the boss.  He created the show.  And it looks like they're really, really close to finishing that. 
[01:14:00]  What a great show, Arrested Development.  And then with Ryan, there was years that went by where I'm like, yeah, I'm going to beat  you up right now.  No, no, of course not.  I think it was when Van Wilder came out.  I looked and I was like, where the fuck do I know this guy from?  Yeah.  And then, of course, it was Poor Little Billy from 15.  Oh, I thought you were going to match.com.  No, no.  No.  We're cool.  I was like, I know that face from somewhere. 
[01:14:30]  And there was some 15 marathon on Nickelodeon years ago.  Oh, God, yeah.  And then it's like.  Not a lot of coke on that show.  No, no, no.  It's just little Canadian school kids.  We're not Canadian problems.  Yeah.  You didn't have that Push or Sandy Duncan on your show.  No, no, no.  We didn't have any of that stuff.  No.  And then the girl there that played Ashley in that wound up in Suicide  Kings.  Yes, she did.  And she ended up being like a very, you know, pretty girl and doing a lot of cool stuff. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, she was a very pretty girl.  Yeah, she was very nice.  Yeah, that was when I was about 13 years old and I was shooting in Florida, which is  a great place to send a 13-year-old Canadian kid.  And I don't know why.  The show was a Canadian soap opera, but it was shot in Florida.  And it was just, I mean, it was some of, it was actually, it wasn't even like somebody  wrote the scripts.  It was like they just friggin' head-butted the keyboard.  Or like, I know one writer would be like, I wrote this entire script with my scrotum. 
[01:15:30]  It was.  I mean, it was just like, it was amazing.  And the problems were the most insignificant problems.  They really were.  But with musical stings accompanying it.  Like, you're just like, this is, come on.  Yeah, when the scene changed, because it was like a soap opera kind of thing with just  these kids in it.  Yeah.  With just dopey-ass problems.  Absolutely ridiculous.  And you were a very, like, meek kid in that.  Yeah.  And then you came out and Van Wilder, I'm like, oh, okay, that's that kid.  I was like, I just, and I just saw a clip of it, too.  I just said, all I had were these gigantic teeth. 
[01:16:00]  I was, yeah, I was, I was a fully functioning life support system hooked up to teeth.  It had to take, though, a year before I finally, it finally clicked, because there wasn't really  much internet going on there that way I could just push up, pull up your IMDb or anything.  God, you go for the obscure.  Well, that was a weird one, yeah.  Yeah, and then I just did a whole bunch of Movie of the Weeks after that.  That's all they did in Vancouver, Movie of the Weeks.  Movie of the Weeks.  I played every ex-Dynasty star son in every Movie of the Week about alcoholism. 
[01:16:30]  Did you see yourself on the cover as, like, sexiest man kind of a thing back then?  Yeah, I had a vision board.  No, no, no, no, I didn't see that zinger coming.  No, no.  Who did you beat out?  Who did I beat out?  Yeah, like, was there somebody right behind you?  Listen, I didn't beat anyone out.  You beat everyone out.  Get your head out of your pants. 
[01:17:00]  For God's sake.  That is a little rude, Jim.  I have no idea.  They don't tell you who else was considered?  No, I think it was just me and Danny Glover.  I don't know why I won.  See, therein lies the difference.  If some miracle happened, Jimmy, and you were put on the cover like that, you would be thumbing  through it obsessively, seeing who you beat.  If I won Sexiest Man Alive, it would also be because I was the last man alive.  I want to acknowledge Just Friends.  I loved that movie with Anna Faris.  Yeah, I like that movie.  She's a funny woman, man.  I like that movie. 
[01:17:30]  We shot that in Regina, Saskatchewan.  And I almost got arrested in Regina, Saskatchewan.  For making fun of their name?  Yes.  Must be a loss.  I thought it was kind of clever.  I had the art department build a sign that I was going to replace the one that sits right  outside the town that says, Welcome to Regina.  And I made this big sign that said, Welcome to Regina, which rhymes with fun.  And I got in a lot of trouble.  I got my brothers a Mountie, and they train all the Mounties there, and I think he got me 
[01:18:00]  out of any significant jail time.  Happens up in Canada, too.  Knowing cops and knowing that.  Mountie.  And I want to go back to Jason, Horrible Bosses.  Yes, sir.  Fuck, I love that movie, too.  That turned out a lot.  Two in a row for you.  Well, thank you.  I mean, that just came out only a couple weeks ago.  I know.  I wish I could control the release dates, because that's a little unfortunate.  You would like them spread out a little bit, right?  It would be nice.  These are relatable problems.  Keep going. 
[01:18:30]  Well, it is as if you wake up in the morning on Christmas morning, and you rip all your  presents open, and you've got nothing to look forward to.  But no, it's a good movie.  I was surprised that one turned out as well as it did, because we didn't know what we  were doing on the set.  We were just screwing around and being idiots.  Was there a lot of improv?  It seemed like there was a bunch of improv in that movie.  Every once in a while.  I mean, the script was really sort of written pretty conversationally, but since you play 
[01:19:00]  three best friends, and you're supposed to kind of talk over one another, so we added  a bunch of little crap, but for the most part, it's all written.  Yeah, and that Charlie Day, he's a superstar in the making.  He is, yeah.  What a good guy.  That guy is funny no matter what he does.  Yeah, yeah.  I hear you.  Well, he's got a kid coming out, so we'll see how funny he is at making kids.  Yeah.  Just ease out of the womb in full clown makeup.  It's going to be hilarious.  I like Always Sunny in Philadelphia as well, but anyway. 
[01:19:30]  How's your sister doing?  She's great.  Thank you.  She's doing very, very well.  She's got a couple of kids and a husband and a digital sort of career started.  She's got some pretty high ideas about what to do in sort of the digital space, so I got  my eye on her.  Did she still act, or did she kind of move on and just go with family and other direction?  Well, she stopped for a while to raise those kids, and then when she came back, she found  that she was a little bit more interested in the digital space, so we'll see. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, cool.  Was there a rivalry growing up with both of you who's working?  Well, I mean, obviously we weren't reading for the same parts, but she was doing well,  and I was doing well, so we really didn't have an opportunity to kind of get into that  schadenfreude stuff, but it was nice that I had somebody else to talk to about how crazy  the town is.  The businesses and everything, yeah.  Have you seen it change a lot in the years you've been there? 
[01:20:30]  Because you've been around for a while.  Have I seen her change a lot?  No, no, no, no, the business itself.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, I don't want to put your listeners to sleep with that crap, but...  Yeah, we already did that.  Basically, half the stuff that was getting made 10 years ago is getting made today, so  that changes things a bit, but as you said earlier, fortunately, to bring it back to  the change-up, it's nice that comedies are getting a little bit louder and a little bit 
[01:21:00]  more, I don't know, it's harder to get audiences into the theater, so the content needs to be  a little edgier, a little spicier, and a little louder, and I like that, because that's the  stuff that makes me laugh, so already comedies are really thriving.  Yeah, I hate the fact that a lot of people try to take that away, and over the years have  tried to tell us what we like and what we want to see, when the fact of the matter is shows  that are on channels like FX and whatnot are getting edgier, using real language, and those 
[01:21:30]  are the best-rated shows, it seems to me like people kind of want to see a little reality.  I think so, too.  If you could do sort of arch humor without winking too much is usually the key, you know,  and I feel like we got away without winking too much in a movie like that.  Yeah, people's tastes are, you know, even though it might be broader, the actual comedic sensibility  is becoming a bit more sophisticated, like you don't need to frame jokes as much, you 
[01:22:00]  can kind of throw stuff away a little bit more, and I think people still get it, so it's  nice.  Yeah, it's good, I think something about Mary was one of the first art comedies to make,  like what, $100 million?  Yeah, it did really well, yeah.  I think that helped a lot, because it's like they want the whole family to be able to go,  it's like if you can't take your 10-year-old, they don't want to put it out, and it's  like, that doesn't make me laugh, as a 43, 39-year-old man, it just doesn't make me laugh  at all.  No, you can't aim for that.  43, check that, 39.  Self-correction there.  Yeah, but isn't it nice to do something that you would laugh at if you saw, like, you know,  because I'm sure you've read scripts that are like, ugh, like, this would never make me laugh. 
[01:22:30]  For me, it's those movies that, you know, and this is one of the things why I really want  to work with Jason, because I met Jason 15 years ago, and we've been dying to do something  together for a long time, and this is one of those movies that has all those little throwaways,  which I love.  You just like, you know, to the stuff you miss if you're watching, I mean, we were at  the premiere the other night, and we were, you know, I think like a good 20% of the jokes  were missed, because people were laughing, and I was like, that is a great problem to  have right now.  Yeah, that gives a movie re-watchability. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  Have you ever been, have you ever seen something bomb that you were watching that you were  in?  Oh, God, yeah.  I did, I did arguably the worst independent film ever, and it's humiliating when you're  watching yourself like, like the jokes are missing, and you're like, ugh.  Look, there's no, no worse feeling in the world.  I wouldn't, I certainly wouldn't be sitting here, if, because you don't want to talk about  it.  You're like, oh, God, just like, I'll do the contractual, walk down the red carpet thing,  and then, uh.  Out the back door.  Throw that adult diaper on and go on a shame spiral, go on a run for a couple of weeks. 
[01:23:30]  Make sure you're not sitting in the middle of a row.  Yeah.  So if you get the hell out of there.  Just go full Nick Nolte.  That's got to be bad when you're on a talk show, and they show a clip, because I've seen  that happen to actors before, too, and they just, they show the wrong clip sometimes, even  in a good movie, and it just, it gets a zero from the audience, and then the lights come  back on, and you're like, all right, and everybody's like, ugh.  That's a terrible thing.  Why did I just say Nick Nolte?  Because he's the best actor on earth.  Because he went crazy.  Were you saying he went crazy?  No, no, yeah, yeah.  And the crazy hair.  I was thinking of the mugshot.  We all visualized the crazy hair right away.  You ever seen Q&A with Nick Nolte, where he played, like, the tranny-loving cop? 
[01:24:00]  No, I haven't seen that.  Oh, it's great.  It's a great movie.  Timothy Hutton, yeah, really hot.  We're telling them what a great movie it is.  That's wonderful.  Well, he's a Nick Nolte fan.  He probably would enjoy Q&A.  I do love Nick Nolte.  I do want to say, when I saw the change-up, people were laughing the entire fucking time  in, you know, packed theater, so I don't think you're going to have a problem with this  movie.  No, no.  Yeah, I hope so.  I mean, word of mouth really fuels stuff nowadays, you know, this whole Twitter thing.  I mean, the marketing department have figured out that all the money they're spending  on commercials, you know, both radio and television, stuff like that, is effective,  but it's not nearly as effective as all this word of mouth that's going around. 
[01:24:30]  Like, films that are bad don't have a Saturday or a Sunday because of people coming out on  Friday are immediately putting it up on their Twitter thing.  Yeah, and people know it's crap or, yeah.  It's incredibly powerful.  It's scary.  It's scary in the hell out of the studio.  Yeah, that is scary.  They can't trick people into just at least opening for the weekend and getting, you know,  their cost back.  So now a movie could die by Saturday morning.  Oh, wow.  I love it.  You love it?  Why? 
[01:25:00]  It's great, man.  I don't know.  It's good.  It's instant.  It's, you know, people can get people.  I'd like to know that.  You know, if you see a movie that absolutely sucks, it's great to know, to find out before  you paid the money.  Sure.  Yeah.  Waste your time.  Yeah, why not?  Do you go to a lot of movies?  I go to them.  This summer I haven't really gone to a lot of movies, but I typically do.  At home, I only watch Turner Classics.  I watch the old movie channel just, yeah.  Over and over and watched them.  Well, it's great.  There's no commercials.  You just sit there and you kick back and, yeah. 
[01:25:30]  You ever see Kiss of Death with Richard Widmark?  I have not seen that.  Oh, he pushes the old lady down the steps in the wheelchair.  It's a very famous scene.  You sick fuck.  It's a comedy to Jimmy.  No, no, it's a good movie.  He likes the old movies.  That's hard to masturbate to.  No, it's not.  No, it's not.  I think we've got to wrap up.  Yeah, these guys are a busy schedule.  You guys work at the greatest place.  There's five televisions in here all on mute.  Like, if I can have that in every one of my rooms at home. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, believe me, there's even more back there.  We just shut them off so we're not distracted.  That is not an attention depth.  That is a creator.  If you want to know.  What the hell?  Oh, there are certain times we'll be talking.  No one else has this, by the way.  The two companies merged.  We were at XM and they brought us over here.  And we insisted that we get all our TVs and we're not sharing with anyone.  So there's a million studios that have no TVs.  We have eight.  And they get really mad.  It's a good vibe in here, though.  I like this.  In the middle of a discussion, if that TV's on, there'll just be a non-sequitur thrown out. 
[01:26:30]  Like, I don't know, look at that.  Yeah, we turned them off so we can focus on it.  Look what Star Jones is wearing.  We do that, though.  We go with that.  We tell our audience to look at something knowing it's radio.  We're retarded.  It's always smart to tell the audience to go to another medium and watch something more interesting  than they're listening to.  What are you going to do?  Yeah, we really are self-destructive idiots.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised because we, just like Jason Starr, the interview, we're  like another switcheroo movie.  What the fuck?  But these guys definitely pulled it off.  It's R-rated.  A lot of nudity.  We didn't even talk about Olivia Wilde. 
[01:27:00]  She is fucking stunning, man.  And it would be helpful if she was a bitch.  Yeah, I know.  She's not.  Do you hate that?  I know.  What did they do with her nipples?  Is that true?  No, what happened was, part of that's my fault.  In the scene, she grabs my hands and puts them on her breasts.  And I'm this married guy in the ladies' man body.  I'm nervous.  I don't know what's happening.  And I guess I'm a little method.  My palms got a little sweaty.  When I took my hands off, I looked down and I saw that I had two pasties on my hands. 
[01:27:30]  And in the scene, you see it.  So I don't know what they did.  Suppose that they put new nipples on her or something.  Fix it in the mix.  If that's true, I think she made a nice choice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She definitely did.  How humiliating is that, though?  Your hands are sweaty and you've got to touch your breasts.  That's embarrassing.  Oh, so sad.  They really got to wrap up.  All right.  They're wrapping us up.  Yeah.  All right.  Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds.  Thanks for having us.  Thanks for having us, guys.  Thanks so much, man.  Absolutely.  The movie Change Up starts this Friday.  So thank you for stopping by. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  We'll be back.  The Virus.  Sirius XM.  Good boy phone and your naughty boy phone.  Your naughty boy phone and your good boy phone.  Your good boy phone and your naughty boy phone.  Naughty boy phone and your good boy phone.  Your good boy phone. 
[01:28:30]  Naughty boy phone and your naughty boy phone.  I like the Naughty Boy phone. 
[01:29:00]  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.'s.  Fuck you!  I'd like to give a big fuck you to poison oak  and taking a piss before you realize it's on your hand.  Fuck you.  Fuck you!  This F.U. goes out to my digestive tract.  Fuck you. 
[01:29:30]  Just when I get out of the shower, get in the truck,  and get ready to drive, ready, get set, shoot your pants.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  I just want to give a big fuck you to my girlfriend's neighbor  who had to call the police because she stepped outside  and fucking flashed me for two fucking seconds,  and then I had to fucking deal with the police,  and now her fucking father forbid me to see her?  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  This is Mike from Noah.  I've got a F.U. for my father-in-law Earl and his wife Anna. 
[01:30:00]  Fuck you, Earl, for having emotions like a fucking 12-year-old girl,  and fuck you, Anna,  for not taking care of your husband on his fucking birthday,  and me and my wife spend fucking two grand  making sure he has a nice birthday  when you make three times fucking more than we do.  I hope your fucking stomach staples pop out, you fat twat.  Fuck you, Anna.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I'd like to send a big fuck you out to my ex-girlfriend, Michelle,  telling me,  oh, I'm so sick, 
[01:30:30]  so I just need some space to deal with my sickness.  Meanwhile, she's getting somebody else beyond my back.  Fuck you, you fat-ass, droopy-titted, cottage cheese-having-ass bitch.  Go fuck yourself.  Fuck you.  I'd like to give a big F.U. to Danny  in the faggity way you say  to leave your F.U.  8-6-F-U-LINE-1.  8-6-6-F-U-LINE-1.  Fuck you, Danny.  Fuck you.  Call the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line.  8-6-6-F-U-LINE-1. 
[01:31:00]  That's 8-6-6-F-U-LINE-1.  The Virus Series XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Show, show, show, show.  Well, Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman,  they had a great time in here.  That was cool, yeah.  Legitimate A-listers.  That is legitimate A-listers right there.  Fuck yeah.  Yeah, man.  I just don't know their, like,  they seem like very cool dudes.  I just don't know their work.  It's like, I know who they are,  but I'm not familiar with a lot of stuff they're doing.  I was relieved that Jason Bateman 
[01:31:30]  started the interview by saying,  yes, I know, another fucking movie  where everyone switches.  Because that put us in a weird position  because we talked about that.  About the switcheroo movies.  And that's why I made sure to see this one,  this movie.  I'm like, I don't know, man.  I gotta see this fucking thing.  And I was pleasantly surprised, yes.  Yes, I liked the movie, yes.  Jason Bateman has done more cerebral projects,  you know, of late.  And Ryan is more of a comedy guy, you know. 
[01:32:00]  Did you ever see the movie Just Friends?  No.  I'm telling you, I'm obsessed with Anna Faris.  I think she's one of the funniest women alive, man.  Yeah.  She's funny.  We had her, right?  She was in her.  We had her in once.  Yeah, we did, yeah.  For what movie?  I don't even remember anymore.  Probably one of the scary movies, thanks.  Oh, it was one of the scary movies.  Yeah.  Because she broke out of that scary movie crap,  and now she's, you know,  and then she was in Observe and Report,  and Just Friends, and a few other projects.  I hope we get her back on the show,  but what was I going to say? 
[01:32:30]  Oh, and Arrested Development was Jason Bateman's big comeback,  but we didn't really want to say that to him,  because he's never stopped working.  Well, I tried saying that in a way.  I know.  But it was like, you know,  because he did have the Hogan family.  It was huge.  And then, like, a lot of 80s stars,  he kind of dropped off the face of the earth,  but he's just saying that's what all actors are pretty much doing.  The ones that have these huge movies that come out  are the exception to the rule.  Most actors are just doing what he was doing in the 90s.  Do you assume, like, I assume that someone like Jason Bateman, 
[01:33:00]  let's say, okay,  all of a sudden you see him on Arrested Development,  and you're like, wow, what the fuck has he been doing for 10 years?  And you realize, no, they never stopped working.  They just didn't have that big...  The big ones, yeah.  ...over-the-top mainstream hit.  Right.  Where we all go, oh, that guy.  Yeah, he was still in, you know, he was saying,  he was doing a lot of work,  but it's just like a regular actor, just kind of...  Did you like the movie Juno?  Milling about...  You know what?  Never saw it, because I just...  I liked it.  I really did.  Just seemed too man for me. 
[01:33:30]  Well, there's a little man thing going in there,  but I liked it.  I liked Juno.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And then he's up in the air, which was a huge success.  Yeah.  You know, we've had our issues with that movie, obviously.  But, you know, it did very well.  And then Horrible Bosses, and now The Change-Up.  Yeah.  Theater's Friday.  I do like the fact that Ryan Reynolds said shame spiral twice.  It's a great term.  You don't hear that often.  A shame spiral.  But he came right in, he was talking about something,  and he said it was shame spiral. 
[01:34:00]  I'm like, that's the guy who's...  Even though he's really handsome,  he probably has a lot of fucking self-hatred somewhere.  Really?  I like that.  Handsome.  He is.  He's a dish.  I was just talking about the Coliseum Project.  It's funny.  You said right before we got back on air,  you want to talk about that for a minute or two.  Yeah.  And I was talking to a hardcore Islanders fan that works here.  That's all he talks about, this guy.  Every time I see him, Islanders, Islanders, Islanders.  You're going to vote.  You're going to...  Yeah.  I don't know anything else about the guy,  but I do know he's a hardcore fan,  and he voted yes.  He voted yes. 
[01:34:30]  He voted yes.  Well, to everybody that voted yes,  you're fucking idiots,  because I've said this,  I spelt this out  since I first heard about this  and said I was voting no.  And I was called an ignorant asshole  by dumb fuck hockey fans.  And that doesn't mean all hockey fans are dumb fucks,  but these were dumb fuck hockey fans  that for no other reason but hockey  wanted the yes vote.  And I said I was voting no.  I was called ignorant, 
[01:35:00]  which, by the way,  I did more research on this project,  I think, than anybody did  before I cast my no fuck you government,  I'm not handing you $400 million vote.  And the day after the vote,  the county executive,  yes, exactly.  That's what Jimmy thinks about the whole thing.  That's what the whole fucking thing is,  a big fucking gasser.  The day after the vote.  Yeah.  That's another one.  Oh, God.  Get a mic on that shit. 
[01:35:30]  Mangano, the county executive,  comes out and says  he's accepting these proposals  for development.  PFDs, they're called.  Proposal for development.  From private enterprise  to develop the property.  And the 77 acres in Uniondale  around the Coliseum,  the Coliseum, 
[01:36:00]  Sporting Complex,  and now they're looking  at private developers  that want to come in  and do this job.  The day after,  they ask the fucking people,  and I told you,  you fucking heard me  on these very airwaves  say they are going  to private enterprise  when the public says  they're not paying  this fucking bill.  The Islanders won't go anywhere.  It's going to get built,  but it's going to get built  with private funds.  And I was told,  bleh!  Wait, you think the government  just wanted all of that money 
[01:36:30]  because they knew  they'd be able to fucking...  They'd be able to take  fucking most of it  and piss it away  on other shit projects  and then increase the price  and taxes  and make this thing  an almost billion dollar  catastrophe.  Now, research, man.  Why is it better  that it's private now?  Because the taxpayers  aren't paying for it  and the people  that are building it  have a vested interest  in the project. 
[01:37:00]  They have an interest.  The politicians  do not have an interest  in the project itself.  They have an interest  in getting the money  and then giving  sweetheart deals  to everybody else  that's fucking  involved in the project  and wasting,  as they have forever,  our tax dollars.  And that's how they blow  every fucking  MTA and OTB.  So they fuck everything up.  Yeah, MTA  and fucking OTB,  all that shit.  And then they ask  for 400 million dollars  and people actually  voted yes 
[01:37:30]  after being fucked over  by the government  for so many years  and giving them  your money  to watch it  be wasted.  You decided  another 400 million,  let's fork it over.  That's where I said no.  I just saw Jimmy  as you're ranting  and he had the exact  same face as I did.  Our blood pressures  both just went up  listening to you.  I get like  blood pressure as well.  I get like Hitler  when I talk like this.  My arms start swinging  when I don't talk like this.  You're right.  Well, an Islander guy  was pissing next to me 
[01:38:00]  in the bathroom  during the break  and he's like,  fucking know what  they did wrong?  They fucking had the vote  in August  when everyone's on vacation  that could afford  something like this.  Shut the fuck up!  So all we had  was the elderly  voting for this  and of course  they're going to vote no.  He's bummed out  that people voted no.  We should have got him  in here to talk.  He might debate Anthony.  He had a good point  to that guy.  He's actually a big fan.  I would love to hear him  debate you.  Garen fucking teed  that is getting built  with private funds 
[01:38:30]  from people that,  like I said,  have a vested interest  in making money,  know how to make money,  and not like the government  where it's just pure waste.  I'm just a tired  Islanders fan at this point.  See?  But it had nothing  to do with hockey  on my part.  I almost want them  to move to Queens  or Brooklyn  because it would just be  a new, exciting thing.  Some kind of new experience?  I'm just so tired.  It had nothing to do  with hockey with me.  That's why when people  are going,  the Islanders,  this, that,  I know it's getting built.  It'll bring in the jobs. 
[01:39:00]  You'll still have  the fucking economy  going because of it.  And it will get built.  And the Islanders  will sign another  fucking lease.  Don't worry about it.  But the worst thing possible  would have been  to hand over  Nassau County  $400 million  when they have  a $100 million  deficit  and they're the  highest taxed county  in the country.  So you,  you wanted to just  fork over that much money  to an agency  that, that blows 
[01:39:30]  at handling money.  Well, fuck you.  I wasn't ready to do it  and I am being  vindicated as we speak.  The day after the vote,  the county executive  is working on  private fucking funding.  All right?  So blow me.  Because he doesn't want  to be voted out  for losing the Islanders.  Of course!  Yes.  Of course!  Now he's got to make  sure this is built.  Yes!  You see the MTA story today?  Oh, another disgusting fucking...  We're obsessed with the MTA  in the New York City area.  Just obsessed by it.  When I go to other cities,  you see how beautiful  the transit system is. 
[01:40:00]  Like, why don't we have  that in New York?  And this thing  is always broke.  Well, don't forget,  we also have a lot more  fucking running around  than they do.  Bad people.  That's true.  Bad people.  But there's a story  in the MTA  that a son got  a nice cushy job  and he had no experience.  He shouldn't have got  the nice cushy job.  The nepotism that goes on...  I think it's right  on the front page there,  Jimmy.  Oh, son of a switch.  With these government jobs  and things like the MTA,  TSA,  the toll takers, 
[01:40:30]  all that shit,  it's this nepotism  that goes on  and cronyism  and fucking graft  and theft  and backroom deals  with your money.  With your fucking money.  That's why  when they ask  for an extra dime,  I am not fucking...  Given the choice,  I will not give them shit.  Could you imagine  if you...  I'm sorry,  they got fired.  The father and son  both got fired.  Yeah, fired!  By who? 
[01:41:00]  Who fired?  MTA.  Vince McMahon.  Oh, so the MTA  was on to this shit.  Oh, that's good.  Apparently he lied  about his kid's credentials  as an electrician.  Right.  Okay, good.  All right, you know what?  We put one in the plus column  for the MTA today.  Yeah, there you go.  One down,  another few thousand  useless assholes to go  before maybe  they could turn a profit.  Imagine you could go  into a business  where you set up a toll.  Oh, yeah.  Just in your neighborhood, even.  That'd be great.  From now on,  you're paying this fucking toll.  Pay me.  How would you ever lose money? 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  How the fuck  would you ever lose money  in a business like that?  Because then  when you set up the toll,  you hire more people  and give away more money  for useless shit  than you're bringing in  with the toll.  That's what you do.  Instead of looking around  and going,  which asshole  am I not allowed to fire?  Do you know how many people  you just can't fucking fire?  No matter how bad  they are at their job,  no matter how many  different levels  of redundancy  is in that job, 
[01:42:00]  you know how many people  cannot be fucking fired?  It's astounding.  And they keep raising the toll.  Like my tunnel,  because I go to Philly a lot,  is the Lincoln Tunnel.  You do the Midtown Tunnel.  I'm the Midtown guy.  I have not seen many changes  in the Lincoln Tunnel  in the last, you know,  whatever amount of years.  What do they do?  It's just amazing.  I'll tell you,  the big change,  three quarters of a mile in,  if you look up to the right,  there are six new tiles.  Ah!  Yes.  I did see those.  Yes.  You have to look quickly.  I will say,  I do believe they are repaving 
[01:42:30]  the inside of the Midtown Tunnel.  I did see one of the lanes.  All right.  I saw some new blacktop on there.  Oh, fuck them.  Why don't they pave it  right the first time?  They do that just so it gets shitty  in fucking,  a little short amount of time.  You're absolutely right.  There are a few cars  driving on there every day.  But they don't do it  the best they can  because they want to have  to repave it,  those fucks.  Yes.  Let me tell you about a little...  Programmed in obsolescence.  Let me tell you about  a little street called Cherry Lane.  Oh, yeah.  Out there on Long Island.  All the virgins lived there.  Oh, Chip. 
[01:43:00]  Old school road.  Yeah.  It's not tar.  It's some kind of rock-based road.  I don't even know what it is.  It's not like asphalt,  just plain like those big rocks.  The point is,  they never had to pave  this fucking road.  Cobblestone?  In the 40 years  that my family  has lived close to Cherry Lane.  Yeah.  To this day,  when I'm out there  every once in a while  and I go down Cherry Lane  or up Cherry Lane,  I'm like,  this is the exact same road  as when I was  a little fucking nothing. 
[01:43:30]  I fucked you  in the Outsiders.  And they never had to pave it  with fucking tar  because Jimmy's right.  Yeah.  You know,  they realized a long time ago,  whoa,  we got to use  shittier materials  because we want to be  paving these roads  every three,  four years.  It does give them reason  to get the crews out there.  We absolutely could come up  with a road  in this day and age  where you would never  have to repave it.  We have a space station  floating around the Earth  and we can't fix the LIE.  Right.  And then we don't 
[01:44:00]  have a space station.  It's an international space station  that we fucking paid  90% for  and we don't even have a ship  to get up there anymore.  Thank you.  What's that?  You know what's going to happen?  Ship.  Oh, ship.  What do you think is going to happen  in this country?  I think some of the states  start going their own way.  Going rogue?  Look for Texas  because as Texas goes,  the rest of the country goes.  I think they've been hinting  for the last couple years  they wouldn't mind doing that.  I think that's what saves  this country in the end.  Like fraction it up 
[01:44:30]  a little bit?  A little bit?  I could think of a few  good reasons to...  And then we get to fight again.  That would be cool  just fighting amongst the states.  How cool would it be to just fight again?  A nice civil war again.  How fun would that be?  It's so much fun.  I kind of would enjoy that.  Civil war.  Nice big fight.  I don't know, but I just...  It drives me insane  when I drive through these tunnels  and over these bridges  and you see a business  where they don't really make  many improvements year after year  but then you read in the paper 
[01:45:00]  that they're fucking broke  and this and that.  I don't...  I can't even wrap my head around that.  I don't get it.  You just watch car after car  going through easy passes  and paying their tolls  and it's like,  how is this business  not making a massive profit?  Constant influx of money.  I don't get it.  Constant influx of money  yet they are pouring money out  faster than they're pulling it in  and they're pulling it in  at a crazy rate.  So where is it all going?  It's going to people, 
[01:45:30]  like I said,  that they are not allowed to fire  because of union jobs.  There are...  Believe me,  and any of you union supporters,  I know anytime I talk union  union supporters jump on me,  but if you're a union guy,  you mean to tell me  you've never seen  an incompetent motherfucker  that's worked with you?  Everyone's just stellar  at their job  and shouldn't be fired?  Bullshit.  You've worked with a bunch  of slouches.  I've done that.  I was in a union.  I know what the fucking deal is  and they can't be fucking fired? 
[01:46:00]  Fuck you.  And when you got shit like that  going on  and people making  disgusting amounts of money  on the public dime  for really jobs  that don't deserve  that much money,  it's ludicrous to me.  And that's why  they can't turn a fucking profit.  And half the money  doesn't go where it's supposed to.  Yes.  Yes.  Thank you. 
[01:46:30]  Thank you.  What rate is that?  I will change that.  Yeah, there's Cherry Lane.  Oh, that's made out of like  concrete and fucking...  Someone's saying it's called  and God, I can't believe  I'm going to read this.  Aggregate...  I can't fucking believe  I've got to read  Rio's fucking tweet  from Indiana.  Opi, it's called...  It's called chip  and seal asphalting.  What's that?  It's a really cheap-ass way  of doing roads.  Asphalt, but that's only  if your ass gets blamed.  I can't believe 
[01:47:00]  I've got to read that one.  Then you've got to say  it's asphalt.  But this fucking road, Anthony,  40-some-odd years, man.  I've never seen it  paved over.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Every road can be that, obviously.  Yeah, worker...  With all the winter storms  and car crashes  and never a pothole, nothing.  Look at this motherfucker.  So someone decided  that's not the proper way  to do roads.  Yeah, that's a good way  to do roads.  Because you don't see  a lot of them like that.  That's a very rare road 
[01:47:30]  on Long Island.  Did Bing Crosby live there?  Because there's cherries?  See, now the union guys  are getting there.  What?  The union guys.  I think, I think,  Lee...  Lee is saying,  yeah, a worker isn't allowed  to make enough to live on,  so kill all the unions.  I didn't say that.  Did I say that?  You did.  No, I didn't.  Yeah, you kind of did.  Did I?  Unions, no, though.  They fucking just,  they've overextended it.  They've had a very important purpose  and they're needed.  But the thing is, 
[01:48:00]  they protect guys  that don't do their jobs as well.  Right!  And that's where  the fucking problem comes in.  Fire some of these assholes  that aren't fucking doing their job.  Every job has fucking slouches in it.  I mean, look,  with Iraq.  But, but, you know,  these people have to...  Kidding, Iraq.  He works very hard.  I'm a tremendous slouch.  Yeah.  Caddy Jack, very good.  That is very good.  But, but,  you gotta be able to fucking  fire people that suck. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  And believe me,  another thing,  when the economy turns bad,  and again,  it's taxpayers' dollars  that are paying for certain things  and certain programs  have to be cut  and certain jobs have to be...  That's called life.  I've been fired before.  It happens.  But you can't get rid of these people  when the economy goes bad  and you decide,  you know what,  we're gonna have to cut back some shit  without a big budel going on,  as they say,  a big budel.  More importantly, Anthony, 
[01:49:00]  was E-Rock distracted  by Ryan Reynolds' dreamy eyes?  What happened?  This is a blurry picture.  Oh, shit.  You had a shaky hand today, E-Rock.  Is that because you didn't use the flash?  No, the first one came out dark,  the second one with the flash.  Why'd you shake?  It's slightly blurry.  I don't know.  I never do that.  Let me see.  He's a terrible photographer.  He hadn't eaten in 10 minutes.  Yeah, you fell in love  with Ryan Reynolds' dreamy eyes,  did you?  And his abs.  I'll tweet it anyway,  fuck it, but it's a bit blurry. 
[01:49:30]  E-Rock is taking so many awful photos  in the studio.  Roland should be doing them,  because I love you, E-Rock,  but your photos,  No, I like E-Rock's photos.  They're terrible.  Roland's not good.  This one's bad,  but in general,  I gotta,  I'm glad I got my own  with those fucking guys.  Roland can't see.  Thank you.  I can't see,  God damn it.  Roland can't see.  Yeah.  I don't know what that's all about.  She blinded me with science.  She blinded me with science.  Wow, that guy did look like Thomas Dolby. 
[01:50:00]  I've been wanting to do that forever.  Had it with that 80s.  This guy walking around this building  that just completely looked like.  He defines the 80s, that guy.  What child does he work on?  Andy Dick Thomas Dolby.  I hate that guy.  My God,  when these actors come in,  am I midget man?  Oh, Ryan Reynolds.  Yeah.  Ryan Reynolds is a tall motherfucker.  Is he?  Yeah.  He's fucking good looking  and he's like six fucking five.  He smelled very good too.  Jesus Christ.  He's dreamy.  I wanted to ask him  what he was wearing,  but it's like,  what am I gonna do?  Put that on myself  and think that I'll smell like  and look like him? 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  I want,  Lost cause, isn't it?  I want,  what's his name's fucking cologne?  He came in one day.  Fuck.  Ozzy Osbourne's is the best cologne.  Ozzy's was good  and who's the guy?  Tippi Tom?  Tippi's, yes.  Tippi.  That would be good.  Tippi.  Tippi.  Holy shit,  I'm having a brain fart.  Black comedian that we love.  Rich Voss?  Who got David,  D.L.  Oh yeah,  D.L.  Hughley.  D.L.  had something good on there. 
[01:51:00]  Anthony.  Sir?  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  There was a kid,  13-year-old YouTube star.  What did he do again, Sam?  He did paparazzi on the piano  at his sixth grade concert.  Oh, right, right.  Oh, I kind of remember that.  Oh, fuck him.  This is a viral video.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  This is a viral video.  And Dumb Extra,  that stupid entertainment show.  Extra! 
[01:51:30]  They did something to me  and Anthony Hates.  And Jimmy.  And this is a guy,  Ellen signed him  to her new record label.  Ellen Regeneres has a record label?  She started a record label  just so she could sign him.  Did she really?  Oh, yes.  All right, let's hear this kid.  He's 13 years old.  Grayson Chance.  His name is Grayson?  41 million views?  What a dork.  Horrible camera work once again. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, what the hell's going on there?  Yeah.  I don't like it.  Zoom in, zoom out,  zoom in, zoom out.  Just keep it on the kid.  Oh, God.  His haircut's in  ragingly fucking  Mick Jagger, 1964. 
[01:52:30]  A little light in the loafers,  you think?  A little light in the loafers,  you think?  I'm glad you said that  because it adds to  what we're about to do.  Oh, okay.  I'm enraged  by the camera work.  The camera's stuck.  How hard is it?  That is a talented  little fuck, though.  I know.  Of course he is.  13, I was crying.  Oh.  Doing something.  I don't know.  Yeah, but you're funny. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, but  you better play piano  and sing like that.  Please, I know.  What are they going to do?  Just let you beat yourself up?  It's embarrassing.  Well, Ed said  light in the loafers,  very good.  Yeah.  Any person can see  maybe the kids late  in the loafers.  At 13, I think they know.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  Blah, blah, blah.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  Accepting that shit, right?  But extra, just clueless,  asking him about girls.  Really?  Is that what I know?  Yeah.  I'm so excited for this record.  I've been working on it for a year now.  We're making a record together.  You've received so much love from Ellen. 
[01:53:30]  What's it like having that kind of relationship with her?  Because she's pretty amazing.  Well, Ellen's wonderful.  You know, she's really involved day to day  with the process of making the record,  picking the artwork.  She's a lot of fun to work with.  Well, I'm not sure if you're used to this.  I'm not so much used to girls hyperventilating behind me.  These girls right here are the sweetest things in the world.  They mean so much to me,  and I just can't wait to give this record to them.  Now, the question everybody wants to know right now,  do you have a girlfriend? 
[01:54:00]  I do not.  Yeah?  These are my girlfriends right here.  Thank you.  Good boy.  Please give it up for Grayson Chan.  Thank you so much for coming.  Wow.  What do you think?  These are my girlfriends right here.  What do you think?  I think the kid may.  He sounded a little feminine.  I'll give him that.  He didn't sound very interested in girls  from that small clip.  I don't know. 
[01:54:30]  More interested in his craft.  Yeah, his craft, his record.  And then these are all my girlfriends.  That's kind of like, you know,  I've seen a lot of guys that have a lot of girlfriends  and they like to go shopping.  Well, I'm on comment on their shoes and things.  But, yeah, I think that was a dumb question.  Yeah.  Should I ask girlfriend or boyfriend?  Is that inappropriate?  And why would it be in this day and age?  Do you have a girlfriend or a boyfriend?  Can't you just assume and just go,  do you have a boyfriend?  Yeah, yeah.  How great would that be? 
[01:55:00]  Well, he probably wanted to be a teen idol.  Yeah, they don't want to...  It's not like the Biebs where he, you know,  at least is faking it really good with the...  No, the Biebs is all about the pussy.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  The Biebs is all about the pussy.  Slinging dick around.  That's right, Sam.  That's why he's maturing.  He's maturing really fast.  He goes, look at my dick.  You know what Selena Gomez fucking pussy juice  does to a beard?  It's like fertilizer.  The kid's growing facial hair.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, the Biebs has facial hair.  Because the Biebs is all about the pussy. 
[01:55:30]  My pussy.  Sam, what does he say after the concerts?  What does he say?  Why don't you come back here  and take a look at my dick?  That's what fucking Biebs says.  Damn!  And they do.  Yeah, they do.  They love it.  And this is Grayson Chance.  Alan's trying to create another Bieber.  Oh, really?  It's not going to happen, though, because...  Who's this guy?  That's Grayson Chance, yeah.  Oh.  I've heard enough of him.  He's very good. 
[01:56:00]  We've got union guys really mad at Ant.  Yeah, well...  Only 7% of the country is unionized, Anthony.  Oh, really?  Of the country, right?  How about every New York City job that's going on?  How about every single New York City job?  Don't talk about the country  when we're talking about places like that other people live.  I live in New York.  I live in a very unionized state, okay?  So it affects me directly.  All my tax money goes to paying a lot of union people. 
[01:56:30]  So blow me.  Do you call for the abolishing...  Abolishing?  Abolition?  Do you call for the abolition of corporation  when they have done 10,000 times more damage than unions?  Really?  Maybe in different ways.  No one's calling for the abolition of the...  But you know what?  And then he's...  He takes a shot at you.  By the way, talk about someone being overpaid.  You know what?  Oh, shit.  Tax dollars ain't paying for this, you cunt. 
[01:57:00]  So fuck you.  Fuck you.  Overpaid.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck yourself.  I hate you.  God.  I knew someone was going to say that too.  Overpaid.  Good.  Good I'm overpaid.  Keep subscribing and listening, dickface.  Because it's not tax dollars that are paying my fucking bill.  You work for me, bitch.  You work for me. 
[01:57:30]  You fucking bitch.  I want you to be inspired by this too, Sam.  Yes.  By the way, I'm talking.  That's how you got to talk to management when you go in there.  Yeah, but you talk...  Oh, fuck.  I'm trying to start a union.  What?  I'm trying to start a union.  You know what?  Not really.  Not a real union.  This will get you fighting...  Your fight up.  Okay.  Yeah.  If you're just tuning in, it's official.  Today is Sam...  Axe.  Axe.  Axe for a Rage Wednesday.  Axe for a Rage.  And a lot of production's already coming in.  We're hoping more production comes in for next Wednesday. 
[01:58:00]  You want me to play a couple of these before we go to break?  Please.  Which ones did you like?  I liked...  Yeah.  I like John Sheetsley's.  We'll play his first here.  Five years ago, Sam Roberts began as an intern at XM Satellite Radio for the Opie and Anthony  show.  I'm primetime Sam Roberts.  And I brought my camera.  Yay!  Oh, and there's a small chance I may be black.  Now, just five years later...  Damn it.  ...he's on damn near every channel on the platform. 
[01:58:30]  It's after Opie and Anthony live here on Sirius 206, XM 105, Sirius XM, it's one.  I'm primetime Sam Roberts.  Do you ever wonder if Kesha had her name legally changed to include the dollar sign?  I know I have.  Welcome to OutQ, bitches!  And now, for the first time in his radio career, Sam Roberts has something to say.  I want my fucking money!  The Sam Ultimato. 
[01:59:00]  Rated R for racial uncertainty.  Under 17, not admitted without parent.  Nice.  And what happens around noon today?  You tweet what?  Here I come, bitches.  And that means you're walking down that fucking hall and asking for your raise, because they  told you a long time ago, you need to axe for a raise every week.  So Wednesday's the day, baby.  Wednesday's the day, then.  Guns a-blazin'.  And it's gonna go down, and we're gonna show them who's boss.  When I get that tweet later today, I'm gonna be very excited. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  Because I know it's going down.  People need to get what they got coming.  Is that really Selena Gomez?  That's right.  Fuck you and your raise, who gives a fuck?  Look at this picture.  Strike strong, mighty.  Remember who was Team Selena a long time ago, by the way, now that everyone else is jumping  on the fucking bandwagon.  Everyone else is on board now.  You didn't even know who she was when I first brought her up.  I have not a clue.  She's of age now.  Holy shit.  What is she doing in that picture?  She's tanning.  She's tanning.  But she's looking at her butt to make sure it still looks fucking spectacular?  She's pulling...  She pulled her bikinis down a little bit. 
[02:00:00]  Why did she pull her bikini bottoms down a little bit in that picture?  She doesn't get one of those silly tan lines.  It's pictures from our good friends at What Would Tyler Durden Do?  Well, give me the fucking link.  The world needs to see that picture, Sam.  What are you waiting for?  And then she's doing the old, uh-oh, the top is off.  It's on What Would Tyler Durden Do?  And you say, give me the picture.  The world needs to see this.  Where are you going to put it that...  Well, no.  I was just going to make it easier by fucking tweeting the link.  You're right. 
[02:00:30]  Is it on the front page?  Yeah, it should be.  All right, if it's on the front page, Anthony's absolutely right.  So it's www.tdd.com to see what we're looking at.  You're right.  You don't have to get it.  Oh, look at that fucking...  You're absolutely right.  What's going on with that ass?  Look at the muscles on top.  That ass muscle thing she got going.  You know what that means?  She takes it in the keister?  Well, she's getting ready.  She's getting ready?  She's gearing up?  She's at that age where, you know, she's got to make sure the muscles are all developed  because she's got a long fucking career ahead of her. 
[02:01:00]  Beaver's going to give it to her or you don't think so?  In the ass?  Yeah.  I think Beaver's all about the pussy.  He loves it.  And I really do think he's all about the pussy, but I think this fucking broad is way out  of his league.  Yeah, she's too much for her.  He needs to bang a few more girls with braces and then maybe eventually move on to something  like that.  Especially because she's obviously...  That's what I hope to do someday.  Move on.  You can't ride that.  She's also pulling her top up because she did that girly thing that's really hot at 
[02:01:30]  the beach where they just undo their top and lay there and it looks like they're completely  topless laying on their tummy.  And then you always catch a peek when they get up to re-tie.  What a scumbag this paparazzi was, though.  You can see he's like hiding in a bush or something.  Yeah, yeah.  You can see the tree branch around him.  There's tree branches.  Oh, yeah.  That's a scumbag move.  You're right.  Yeah.  What an asshole.  What an idiot.  Well, he's not an idiot.  He's a scumbag, though.  He must have had a boner just knowing he was going to get these pictures.  You're talking to two guys that were known as Twinkle Toes for a while when we went to 
[02:02:00]  Turks and Caicos.  We were fucking in and out of bushes to look at topless broads from France.  Were they from France?  Somewhere in Europe?  I don't know.  All I know is I had a giant digital camera.  One of the first fucking digital cameras ever.  And I was giant.  I'm trying to take like incognito pictures of girls.  I'm holding what amounted to like the same thing they took pictures of Lincoln with.  I needed a boom.  One of those gunpowder flashes.  We were in Turks and Caicos and we were absolutely peeping Toms. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  Because we didn't know Club Med.  All the women come from Europe where it's completely normal to go topless.  So we're going in and out of the palm trees and the bushes to try to take pictures of  them.  You had to get close.  Check that one.  Check that one.  Check that one out.  And then we loaded it on our very primitive website, Sam.  Oh, yeah.  Where each picture took probably a half a day to load.  I had a link up to a satellite dish.  Literally.  To a satellite dish with this laptop that was just archaic and transmit these photos. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  And you know how good compression rates were back then.  One picture did take like an hour to fucking put on a site.  So don't say what you said.  Scumbag move or whatever you said.  Yeah.  Because we've been there, Sam.  I'm not saying you guys aren't scumbags.  We've been there, Sam.  We got another production piece for Sam Axe for a Raise Wednesday.  Listeners are sending these in and I can't wait to hear the other ones that they're making  now.  Yeah.  We're going to go to break with this. 
[02:03:30]  Garen Benner sent this in.  And then when we come back, Michael, Ian Black joins the show.  Do you have a raise, sir?  I don't know.  How many weeks has it been?  Are you Sam Roberts underpaid at Sirius XM Satellite Radio?  This whole thing is not working out well.  You deserve a raise.  And now we're going to go with a production piece.  In a world of fish sticks and wrestling, Sam Roberts is an asshole. 
[02:04:00]  I don't care about these guys.  You're ungrateful.  And he's black.  N-double-A-C-P.  Oh, Carolina man wants lasers.  Wednesday, he begs for money from the man, Steve Blatter.  Why would you say I begs me?  That's right, Steve Blatter. 
[02:04:30]  Wednesdays, Sam asks for a raise.  The Virus Sirius XM.  She was a prom queen who could have any guy she wanted.  He was a high school outcast looking for love.  Stay away from my girlfriend, punk.  No matter how hard he tried, she would never notice him until...  No, no, it's Bobo. 
[02:05:00]  Bobo Loco.  Action.  Stop it!  Suspense.  Tell me what it's all about.  The thrill ride of a lifetime.  Screaming for blood and looking for love.  She wants it.  She wants it.  She wants it.  She wants it.  She wants it.  She wants it.  A man over the edge of insanity.  Bobo Loco.  I won't stop.  I won't stop. 
[02:05:30]  Series XM.  Series XM.  The O.P.R. 3 Show.  Got a very busy day.  I just walked by the fishbowl.  We're going to be heading down there in a few minutes.  Guy Fieri is going to be cooking for us. 
[02:06:00]  And I went to Kenny really fast.  I go, Kenny, are you going to try Guy Fieri's food?  And he's like, I'm not going to eat his food.  Why?  Because it came up the freight elevator and it's been sitting out all morning.  So he says.  Obviously, that's not true.  No, he wouldn't do that to us.  But Kenny doesn't know how to enjoy himself ever.  That's all it is.  It's ridiculous.  He's a miserable man.  You think?  Yeah.  It's obvious.  Why wouldn't you eat Guy Fieri's food?  Do you know who Guy Fieri is, Michael?  Sure.  Guy Fieri.  You don't know.  Oh, I love that guy. 
[02:06:30]  You don't know, do you?  Yes.  He's that guy.  He is the guy.  People love that guy.  Minute to Win It.  Anything?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, sure.  Love that thing.  Love that thing.  He's, uh, I mean, he has no idea who I am either, so, you know.  I bet he does.  He probably does.  Yeah, he does.  Look, let's be honest.  Guy Fieri is a fan.  He's a very big fan.  Let's see who has more Twitter followers.  I think Michael Ian Black has more Twitter followers than Guy Fieri. 
[02:07:00]  It is weird how you judge people on Twitter followers now.  It's like, you know, it's like, oh, how many Twitter followers?  Well, how else should you judge people really?  Cock sense.  No, Twitter followers, it's weird how you look at that.  But in all honesty, it is the only true measurement of a man.  Yeah.  Yes.  It used to be dick length.  Yeah.  Now it's Twitter followers.  Now it's followers.  I have a lot of followers.  Some people got millions, and you're like, why?  Why?  It upsets you.  Or me.  I'm one of those people.  You have a million six.  What did you start with? 
[02:07:30]  Like, did you all of a sudden have zero?  No, no, no.  But I mean, out of the gate, you fucking get, like, 100,000 the first week.  Yeah, no, they gave me a credit of a million.  It's like, for certain gambling sites, you know, they just give you a credit right when you  go, and then you lose it.  I didn't lose it.  You know, my bankroll has only grown.  I'm very good at Twitter.  No, the truth is, the only reason that I have a lot of Twitter followers is because I joined  early enough so that I was one of the first comedians.  They promoted me right away.  Oh, jeez.  So all these people joined as Twitter was exploding. 
[02:08:00]  I would say 95% of the people who follow me on Twitter just never bothered to unfollow  me.  They don't know who I am.  Oh, okay.  I have very soft.  It's a very soft 1.6 million.  You understand?  Yeah, yeah.  I wish it were different.  It's not.  Do you remember the big race to a million by CNN and Ashton Kutcher?  I do remember that.  Oh, was that like two or three years ago?  That's about two and a half years probably.  Who will have a million first?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, the fact is, I mean, how many people actually read your stuff?  I think it's less than 10%.  I don't know.  I really do. 
[02:08:30]  I think every single one of my followers reads everything I say with interest and verve  and vigor.  I enjoy it, but I just know that it's a very small percentage of people actually reading  your tweets.  I can't tell.  I mean, I would say 10-15% maybe that really respond to something.  Yeah.  But do you see it when gigs?  I mean, do you just Twitter a gig or are you actually doing press for gigs?  I tweet and do press and I can't tell.  I don't know if it has an effect or not.  It's hard for me to tell.  Because I sell out everywhere, so it's hard for me to tell. 
[02:09:00]  I love you.  You know?  It's got to roll.  Speaking of Twitter, did you say something ill of Ryan Reynolds?  Oh, fuck me.  Sir, what happened there?  I was upset when I heard he was here because I don't have the kind of constitution that  can handle somebody being upset with me.  I don't have that.  Yeah.  I did confess earlier in the week and I literally wrote confession.  I am not now and do not think I will ever be a Ryan Reynolds fan.  And I did not mean that as a guy.  I'm sure he's a lovely, lovely man. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, his work.  His work, you know, and not to put too fine a point on it, is terrible.  Okay.  Wow.  Just not, he's real brave now that he's gone, Michael.  Oh, no, if he were here, I'd be sucking him off if you wouldn't believe, but he's not  here.  He just, in my, you know, limited Ryan Reynolds experience has yet to make a film that I would  go, I love that Ryan Reynolds movie.  I'm not there yet.  Wow.  I was saying, I don't know, and not because, for being aloof, I know who both of those guys 
[02:10:00]  are.  I recognize them, but I don't know the films that they've done.  I haven't seen, like, I've never seen a Steve Carell movie, but I know who he is.  I liked Blade 3.  I just don't know their movies.  Oh, was he in Blade 3?  He was.  Case in point.  And he was all buff and everything.  That's part of my problem with him.  Don't get too yoked up, guy.  You're Canadian.  There's no such thing.  You know what I mean?  Just be adorable.  Don't be adorable and yoked.  It's gross.  He's a handsome fucking guy, man.  It was depressing.  I got a picture between the two of them.  It's like, I mean, I'm usually not the fucking handsome one in the shot, but that really 
[02:10:30]  put a fucking exclamation point on me.  Yeah, doesn't it really kind of like, you look at the picture, you go, why did I even  take that picture?  When was the last time you were the handsome one in a photo, Jimmy?  Do you remember?  You're seeing him in natural history?  Yeah, the fucking burn victim unit.  I'm fucking trying to think of awful places to name.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I don't want to know.  What, the food has begun?  You come in with a fucking dick-looking sausage on a dirty napkin.  A fucking dirty rag.  And he puts it in front of me like I'm at the Waldorf.  I don't think Guy Fieri pictures his food being eaten that way off a fucking napkin. 
[02:11:00]  Would it kill you to throw a little parsley on that?  Just a sprig.  Roland's been waiting for this day for, I don't know, months.  He said he's been dieting or something or eating sensibly.  Yeah, knocking down his calories so he can have a cheap day.  Having not met Roland before, I'm surprised to hear he's dieting.  Yes, yes.  He doesn't strike you as the type that's been showing willpower for a while?  All I'm saying is I've just never met the man.  I didn't, the first phrase that came to mind was not, have you been dieting? 
[02:11:30]  Look at this shelf of fat on the back of his neck.  Oh my God.  That's his soft spot.  Why is that on out there?  Oh boy, that's his soft spot.  Why?  Is it on out there?  Yes, he just heard me.  Oh, Roland.  Who turned it out there?  He's giving it to the cat.  Why is it?  We keep saying don't fucking turn the sound on out there.  Who turned the sound on out there?  It was on there for Ryan's publicist.  Oh boy.  Who turned it on?  I did.  Here's what's going to happen.  We're going to get so in trouble one day.  We're going to get fucking fired.  We had an issue one time with another person here.  But we're not allowed to do it when the publicists are out there. 
[02:12:00]  We're not allowed to do it because they might have said yes, but the bottom line is I had  somebody go to human resources on me, some fucking pussy that works here, because we  had like a war of words between the shows and I insulted him on the show, but he was  outside, but then he heard it.  He goes, oh, it's a hostile work environment because he's walking down the hallway.  But Jim, you understand that even if they're in the hallway, this is broadcast elsewhere.  That person easily could have heard that you had been talking about.  As long as it's outside the building.  That's my low self-esteem.  I don't think it's going anywhere beyond this one.  That's logic.  It's something they don't have around here. 
[02:12:30]  But they can't claim hostile work environment if you're broadcasting it like that.  But if you're saying it about them as they're walking by, I'm just saying, even though  it's bullshit, that's what we have to do.  And the fact that it's happening again, even if it was turned on before.  Okay, then let Bladder deal with human resources or let them cover my insurance.  Or human racehorses, like you were going to say.  Human racehorses, yes.  More importantly, how's the sausage?  Fucking amazing.  Is it really?  It's worth the two days of night you leave that much.  I think he's going to use that as a slug line there.  He's going to have quotes that say, Roland, fucking amazing. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  You're eating that the way the dogs ate the dick in Caligula.  I've never used that joke before.  I've never used that joke before.  I have an issue.  I have an issue.  I rarely do this to you.  But you said you bought donuts with me yesterday.  I didn't eat them.  Oh.  Because I knew the food was going to be here today.  What did you do with them?  I threw them away.  I gave it to a homeless guy.  He just tossed them.  He made believe he was buying donuts because we were trying to figure out who this broad  was on Columbus Avenue yesterday that kept covering her face every time we walked by.  It was the chimp attack lady.  We didn't even recognize her. 
[02:13:30]  Higher hopes for that.  That's not bad.  And she spoke in some weird foreign fucking accent.  Yeah.  So we're thinking she might have been a big star from somewhere else.  Big star.  So he went in and goes, I'm going to buy donuts so you have more time to try to figure out  who she is.  I'm like, you're buying the donuts for yourself.  Way to take one for the team.  Anyway, it's not about Roland.  It's about Mike.  You always stand to during, I used to stand to the radio too.  It's fine.  Like for years I did.  Then I just got like tired.  Well, because it's early and I just feel like, let me get the blood circulating.  I'm here. 
[02:14:00]  I used to feel that way.  I want to have my A game for O and A.  What's the book you're doing with Megan?  I used to feel like that.  I'm doing a book with your friend Megan McCain.  Yeah, yeah.  We're doing a book about why politics is so kind of fucked up in this country.  Are you guys on opposite ends of the spectrum?  Are you kind of covering both ends?  Yeah.  Well, I mean, she's obviously a Republican.  I'm not.  She's a conservative.  I'm not.  I'm married.  She's not.  She's more of a liberal Republican though.  She's not like an arch conservative.  Well, no, she's not an arch conservative.  She's more of a moderate Republican, but I think she probably represents more of what  actual Republicanism is than the people on the right wing fringe. 
[02:14:30]  And I probably represent more of what actual Democrats are than people on the left wing  fringe.  So we literally just got in an RV and traveled the country for the last month talking to  people.  And we'd actually never met before.  We kind of had met over Twitter and we had met very briefly over satellite doing a TV  show.  And now we're writing a book together.  Who paired you guys up?  Was it a, was it a, uh, uh, editor's question or decision?  It was Ambien.  Ah, I was on Ambien, saw that she had tweeted something, tweeted to her, we should write a 
[02:15:00]  book.  And then to my surprise, she said, sure.  And she thought I was kidding.  It's as easy as it works.  Yeah.  It was, it was Ambien and Twitter.  Ambien is fucking, cause Dice used to make phone calls on Ambien.  He would fucking call me and other people and he was on Ambien.  And it was just nonsense for fucking hours on the phone and you couldn't get off the  phone with him.  It's fucking horrifying what Ambien does.  You sure it was on Ambien or just Dice?  It was, no, on Ambien he was worse.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's really fucking bad, man.  Especially now with Twitter, uh, and things where you can have immediate, you know.  Oh yeah, embarrass yourself. 
[02:15:30]  Oh yeah, I've done that many times.  In this case it worked out because I got a book deal, but, uh, oftentimes I don't get  book deals when I'm on Ambien.  Oh boy, yeah.  Let me say, nine times out of ten that I take Ambien, I don't get a book deal as a result.  What happened to fucking, uh, we, uh, I did the third episode of Ed, which was a funny  show, man, um, with Tom Cavanaugh, who I liked a lot.  It reminded me of Costner and, uh, Mike Starr was in that.  You guys know Mike Starr?  Sure.  He was fucking, and, uh, I was, I was really mediocre in the episode, but why'd they take  that off?  Uh, I had nothing to do with it. 
[02:16:00]  I didn't, it was not my call, Jim.  Because everybody said you were the one that finally pulled the plug on that one.  Well, I am essentially TV aides.  When I'm on a TV show.  I'm like that, but in the sexual sense.  I am the kiss of death for any television program.  And, you know, actually now, you can probably live with AIDS better than you can live with  me on your television show.  AIDS is kind of a chronic condition now.  You can kind of deal with it.  I love your TV show. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, you can kiss it goodbye.  There's no medication for me.  There's no cocktail for you.  Unfortunately, no.  What, because I feel the same way about myself.  I really do.  Like, everything I touch fucking just dies.  And it's, creatively, I feel like I'm a fucking kiss of death.  Like, everyone.  That, no, but that is the wrap on you and show business.  If I've had this conversation about you, you're on Louie's new show.  You're going to be on this week's episode.  But I'm not on Louie's new show.  I'm not, like, a regular on Louie's new show.  I'm always a regular.  He has no regulars, though.  But if I was a regular, it would have been off by season one. 
[02:17:00]  Right, you were a regular on the last one.  Lucky Louie.  Done.  Yes.  Dead.  Comedy Central.  Fucking tough crowd.  Dead.  Two seasons.  At least the state lasted for a while.  And fucking Ed lasted for a while.  They both did.  They did gangbusters business, Jim.  Gangbusters business.  Do you guys still do live?  I saw you guys, I think it was the state, did a really funny live show in UCB.  What show did you used to do live on a Monday?  Was it some weird thing?  Stella?  Yeah, Stella, right.  Yeah, me and Michael Showalter and David Wayne, formerly of the state. 
[02:17:30]  Then we had a trio called Stella, which ended up with our own TV show on Comedy Central.  And we used to perform every week.  And we hosted a show last night to celebrate the 10th anniversary of a movie I did called  Wet Hot American Summer, which, uh, cult movie.  I never saw it.  No, and these guys have never heard of it.  But, packed theater last night.  Packed.  I'm sorry we didn't have more on that.  I'm trying to remember that.  I'm really sorry.  It's big in the old comedy community, obviously.  You guys are not a part of it.  Yeah, I know.  But you know what you just did? 
[02:18:00]  I'm going to go check out the movie now.  I appreciate that.  I'm absolutely going to go check it out.  What's your favorite thing you've ever done work-wise?  Like, as far as, uh, whether it's a TV show or a film, if you had to pick one thing that  you're like, this is what I, I'm happy with, what would it be?  Oh, man.  Uh, I just, I just wrote a book that I'm very happy with that, uh, I think is going to be  good.  What?  It's called You're Not Doing It Right.  And, uh, it's kind of, it's memoir.  It's sort of, it's a personal thing.  And I've never written anything personal before.  Mm-hmm.  And so, that I'm happy with. 
[02:18:30]  Is it, is it comedy or more autobiographical of serious?  It's both.  It's both.  I mean, hopefully it's funny, autobiographic.  What about the title?  Why, why that?  Uh, because it's what my wife says to me pretty much every day of my life.  Every day?  Yeah.  You're not doing it right.  Right.  So, it refers, it refers to the first time I smoked pot when I was in Amsterdam with  her.  And, uh.  You're not doing it right.  Yeah.  I love it.  Yeah.  What were you doing wrong?  I don't know.  But you weren't doing it right.  But you put the joint in his mouth and drink water over the joint.  No, that's not doing it right. 
[02:19:00]  Is the book about your upbringing a little bit?  It's, it's a little bit, but it's actually more about my, my marriage and my sort of current  life, but it also goes back.  Gotcha.  And, uh, oh, God, it's.  We were just talking about our horrible childhoods today, so.  Yours and mine?  Well, me and mine.  Yes, he was.  We were just speculating, speculating on yours.  You must have had a horrible one, too.  He has to be a disaster.  It has to be.  Every comedian has some kind of friggin' disastrous childhood.  I had a weird lesbian upbringing.  Yes.  Abusive relationship.  That kind of thing.  You know.  Weird abusive relationship. 
[02:19:30]  Lesbian.  I was talking about how during, during my childhood, I was raised in that time where  it was just completely fine to, you know, get the strap.  Right.  And, and, and, and beat kids with a strap.  If you try that now, the parents will go to prison.  Other people will step in and stop you from doing it.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Complete strangers will stop you.  Or, depending, join in.  It really depends.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just, the kid is annoying.  Did you ask, was there, was there an actual strap?  Yeah, there was a dad's belt. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  And, uh, very rarely, though, we'd get hit with it.  But we did get hit with it.  Most of the time, though, we would hang it on the doorknob of the bedroom and go, don't  make me come in there.  And it would just kind of ominously hang there.  The, the light reflecting off that big buckle.  And you're just kind of like, oh, shit.  Now we've got to shut up.  No, it's like the Klansman's noose in the old South.  They just hang that there and say.  And it was scary enough.  Yep.  Time to move.  To keep me in line.  Time to move.  I know.  It was quite a while before I even looked at a white woman. 
[02:20:30]  That was, uh, scary.  Have you?  No, I was just saying, that's the kind of childhood I had.  You, obviously, appeared to be a bit younger.  I think you were probably raised in a little more of a, um.  Right.  Well, I'll be turning.  A progressive household.  I will be turning 23 this year.  Oh.  Yeah.  That's adorable.  Thank you.  I'm, I'm, I'm getting old, you know.  But, uh, you know, I'm dealing with it.  What's worse than somebody who's 23 who has a great career?  Oh, it's fucking horrible. 
[02:21:00]  I hate it.  I see people that are fucking, I'm 43, man.  I see somebody who's like 22, 23 with a great career.  I just want to get fucking battery ass in their face.  Can we expand that out to say, I hate anybody with a good career?  Yeah, I believe you.  They don't have to be 23.  No.  That's true.  That's the starting point.  Up to 23, I don't begrudge them from 23 to 42.  I want them dead.  You just got to hate 23-year-olds in general, because they've got their whole life ahead  of them.  Unless I'm fucking them.  If I'm fucking a 23-year-old, then you're all right with that.  Yeah, especially if they're a chick.  If not, well, I'll just fuck a youthful guy, because they have no idea how fucking young 
[02:21:30]  they are.  Yeah.  Well, there's a, there's a fine line between boyish and girlish.  I mean, they're almost the same.  They're almost there.  That nubile thing, that crosses genders.  Yeah, it's kind of like in Caligula, the second time I'm going to reference Caligula, but  you remember, do you like satyrs or nymphs?  When Peter O'Toole asked Malcolm McDowell, boys and girls.  You know Caligula the way these guys know Wet Hot American Summer.  He does know Caligula, man.  I'm a fucking Caligula expert.  We had Malcolm McDowell in.  I'm so fucking annoyed I didn't ask him about Caligula.  We harped on Clockwork Orange for the whole fucking hour. 
[02:22:00]  You have to, though, right?  And you're promoting, by the way, Michael is promoting, so we don't forget what you're  promoting.  Oh, yes.  It's called Michael Ian Black, Very Famous.  And this is, is this on Comedy Central?  It's on Comedy Central, my first stand-up special this Saturday at 11.  Comedy Central.  And the CD and digital download are available Tuesday.  Tuesday.  So it will air first, and then it will be available next Tuesday.  And it's also Michael Ian Black on Twitter.  And this is your first hour.  But did you do stand-up first or sketch?  Sketch, for years. 
[02:22:30]  I'm fairly new to the stand-up game.  The last few years I started doing it.  And it's been great.  It's really fun.  Was it scary?  Oh, it's terrifying.  But part of the reason I did it was because I was so scared to do it.  Because I admire stand-ups like Jim and all the guys that I've seen around New York for  years.  It is amazing, yeah.  I've admired them and always thought, I want to do that, I want to do that, I want to  do that, and just never had the courage.  And then finally I just was unemployed.  I look at it and go like, I would never do that, never do that, never do that.  Because it's just so, I don't know, you're just alone up there. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, yeah.  That's frightening.  I think sketch is harder.  I think doing improv sketch is fucking harder, because it's like, you have to play off somebody  else.  But that's what you do every day.  You do that every day.  That's your job.  But it's like, I'm playing off myself, so I can kind of take it any direction I want.  But if you're improv-ing with somebody in the sea, I mean, I'm telling you, it's like,  wherever they go, oh, you're a salesman.  And then you have to be a salesman.  It might be harder, but I don't think it's as scary or intimidating, because at least you  have other people to work off of.  If you all of a sudden draw a blank, somebody else can pick up the slack and keep it going. 
[02:23:30]  You, on the other hand, have to stand there and just go, bomb.  Yeah, but you look worse.  If you're bombing in a sketch, somebody else looks better than you.  At least as a stand-up, I'm either looking great or fucking horrible on my own.  There's no relative comparison right next to me.  Like, wow, that guy's good.  What the fuck's he doing on the same stage?  Oh, yeah.  Have you died doing that?  I'm sure you've had those nights where you just have nothing, no fucking improv, no nothing.  Yeah, I mean, there are nights, as you know, where you're just sort of sucking wind and 
[02:24:00]  just struggling to get through it and just kind of gasping for air.  But those are helpful.  Those are helpful nights, you know.  My son's at baseball camp right now and failing miserably at it.  And, you know, yesterday he was tearful and we had a talk about it.  And I said to him, do you know how many times I've gotten on a stage and told a joke  and nobody's laughed?  And he said, 50 billion?  You didn't want a number. 
[02:24:30]  It's like rhetorical, kids.  Please.  Exactly.  There is a track off your CD that comes out Tuesday, Disappointed in My Children.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure your kids are not happy with that track.  Well, they don't.  I don't share with them.  How old are your kids?  Eight and ten.  Eight and ten.  All right, so they're becoming aware.  A little bit.  I don't share with them the filth that is my career.  They don't wash your stuff?  No.  No, no, no.  Do they appreciate who you are and what you've done?  No.  No.  They think you're just a nerd or something?  I mean, they know my role in the house, which is the Omega, you know. 
[02:25:00]  I love when there's celebrities with children and the children just could not be bothered.  Don't give a shit.  No.  No.  I'm sure you don't like Dad.  No, and if anybody recognizes me, they get, you know, annoyed more than anything else.  Really?  Yeah.  God, come on.  Well, it's just like, really?  That person likes you?  You know, it's like that kind of attitude. 
[02:25:30]  But as they get older, they'll probably appreciate it, though.  When their friends start to be like, wow, your dad is Michael, then they'll probably start  to appreciate it.  Especially when the chicks fucking show up.  If a girl recognizes you.  I have nothing to offer them emotionally.  So if they can't enjoy me from a professional point of view, I'm useless.  Purely materialistic and professional.  Oh, I'm doing everything I can to buy my children's love.  Yeah, that works.  Every day, it's another Wii game.  Here, kids.  Take a Wii game.  Come on.  I throw them at them like Scooby Snacks.  Take a Wii game, kids.  And that'll work. 
[02:26:00]  They'll just adore you for it.  Yeah.  You like being a parent?  I love it.  I mean, it's, you know, it's trite to say, but, you know, it's the best thing that I've  ever done.  It's unbelievable.  Every parent says that.  I know.  You guys have kids?  Do you have kids?  Except for, you know, Casey Anthony.  I got a 15-month-old.  Oh, 15-month-old.  Babies are terrible.  No, I'm all in already, man.  Really?  You like it?  It's completely changed my life.  Is it a girl?  Babies are terrible.  No, babies are the worst.  I hated my kids.  I hated my kids.  When did you start liking your kids? 
[02:26:30]  When they were about like two, two-ish, you know?  When they started to give me something.  You know what I mean?  I gave them, look, I gave them everything I had, but come on.  You gotta give me a little something.  When they started to acknowledge you, maybe with a hug or a kiss on the cheek.  Yeah.  Fair enough.  That's starting to happen.  Yeah, that's good.  But when I'm just giving, giving, giving, and I'm not getting anything in return, I'm like,  fuck yeah.  Just changing diapers.  Who gives a fuck?  Yeah.  Smiling at everyone that comes over.  It's like, oh, not a special smile for me?  Yeah, yeah.  Great.  That's a great point, man. 
[02:27:00]  That's funny.  Yeah.  I did watch my brother do that with his daughter, and she's like a little over two now.  And it was.  It was at first just like this useless thing that you have to tote around everywhere.  Oh, they're the worst.  And now she's kind of funny and stuff, and kind of runs around, says wacky shit.  Yeah.  They're really all stupid, too.  Oh, God.  They're just dummies.  Yeah.  They don't know what they'll do.  They'll run head first into a table that is like just shorter than they are. 
[02:27:30]  Right.  Not knowing.  It's like, what do you got to put bridge clearance signs on these fucking things?  They don't understand the concept of my head is going to crack into this thing.  It goes without saying, but it is worth repeating.  Kids are stupid assholes.  Stupid assholes.  In my house, I don't have children.  Don't plan on having them.  In my house, I just bought a beautiful razor blade coffee table.  Oh, yeah.  And it's just all lined with different types of razor blades.  And it's very frightening. 
[02:28:00]  I could have gave you the one I had to give away.  Oh, is that one?  I had that exact fucking table.  Yeah.  As soon as I saw them starting to do headers, I'm like, holy shit, this got to go.  Yeah, they're going to fuck themselves up.  And then I went to a pottery barn and bought some shitty fucking comfy thing.  I put gummy bears and toys behind very thin glass at very low levels in the house.  Oh, that was an accident waiting to happen.  Parents, stay away.  Fuck.  Got to get rid of that.  With their little kids.  That was a bummer.  But that's artful.  What you're doing is artful. 
[02:28:30]  Yes, yes.  And if the kids can't appreciate art, they have no business in your house to begin with.  They're even dumber than I thought.  Yeah, I mean, those Razorblade coffee tables, those are all the rage right now.  They're great.  Yeah.  I hate kids.  Does fucking GoDaddy have a good reputation or no?  That fucking website.  You're asking me?  You're looking at me like I have any idea.  Do you have michaelianblack.com?  Boy, that was out of there.  I'm sorry.  I just got an email from Kenny.  I'm out of my mind, angry.  What happened?  Do you have your name as a website?  Is michaelianblack.com yours or no?  No, somebody took it.  Some scumbag.  Kenny tried to bid on my fucking name. 
[02:29:00]  Jimnorton.com.  Who dollars?  A dollar and 71 cents.  I'll try to you-know-what them down.  You can say it, Kenny.  You're Jewish.  But it's fucking Jimnorton.com is owned by some fucking animals in the Bahamas.  But Jimnorton.com was up for a bid.  I really don't want it, but I would take it because it's easier to remember than eat a bullet.  Yeah.  And the bid started at $350, $350 on GoDaddy.  So I asked Kenny to bid on it, so I'm not bidding on my own name.  So he bids on it for $350, and they're like, you've got to raise the bid a little bit. 
[02:29:30]  Nobody else bid on it, and then they wouldn't sell it to him.  Why?  I don't know.  How the fuck is that not a-  And meanwhile, if you bid on it, it's a binding contract from your end.  And then he calls GoDaddy, and they tell him, well, the seller doesn't have to sell.  It's in the terms of agreement or whatever, terms of service, but it's not.  He read the terms of service, it's not in there.  So I don't know if anybody's ever used them and had the similar experience, but they put  something up, they start the bidding at $350.  If only $350 gets bid, shouldn't it be sold? 
[02:30:00]  How the fuck can they ask for $10,000 for JimmyNorton.com?  Is that what they're asking?  Fucking scumbags, yeah, I'm out of my mind.  $10,000?  I don't care if I get it now, because I probably won't use it.  I don't go by Jimmy anyway, but what fucking scumbags?  That's a shitty fuck.  Damn grand.  And they're like the broker.  GoDaddy is not the actual ones.  They're the broker for some other cunt.  Jim.  Yes.  I'm going to write you a check.  Thank you very much.  For $10,000.  I want you to go out.  Get yourself a little website.  I want you to buy that website.  God, am I fucking angry at these cyber people. 
[02:30:30]  What's your website?  What do you do?  I'm on Tumblr, mostly Twitter, mostly just Mike Lee and Black Twitter.  That seems to be the most effective thing.  Do you think websites are kind of going away, like with Facebook video and all that shit?  Yeah, a little bit.  I mean, blogging has sort of gone by the wayside.  I used to blog a lot, but it's just, it's too much.  It's too much.  I don't want to read anybody's blog.  I don't want to write anybody's blog.  I just, the Twitter's the easiest.  140 characters is fine by me, man.  You get in, you get out.  That's all you need.  It really teaches you editing, too.  It does, doesn't it?  If you want to retweet, sometimes I really want to retweet something badly, but the idiot, 
[02:31:00]  like, and the idiot's using, he's placing, putting a question out there, but he's using  up all the characters.  So, most people aren't going to answer, because you hit, you know, retweet, and then you get  that negative thing, and you're like, I got to start editing right from the start.  Right.  There's so many people.  T-W-O.  All right.  The number two.  There were so many fucking people I wanted to write back, but for that exact reason,  I'm like, ah, fuck it.  He only gave me seven characters.  I can't do shit with that.  You're right.  I try to keep it concise.  Yeah.  Nice.  Well, you have to take a break, because Guy Fieri's ready to go. 
[02:31:30]  If you want to join us for food, Michael, you're more than welcome.  We're going to eat in the other place.  We're going to eat and just hang and do the rest of the show from another...  In the front of the building.  I don't know what the fuck that's all about.  Yeah.  I hate when they call it the fish bowl.  That's fucking awful.  If Michael Ian Black is not back with us when we get back from break, let's not forget  the big Comedy Central special.  This Saturday, 11 o'clock.  The first one, man.  That's very cool.  Thanks.  I appreciate it.  It's called Very Famous, and then the CD and the DVD come out on Tuesday?  Yeah.  CD Digital Download is available Tuesday. 
[02:32:00]  And you can just go to...  Oh, you got michaelianblack.net.  I do have that.  Yeah, I got jimnorton.net, too.  And you can go there for Michael's tour dates.  He obviously does sell a lot of tickets.  Michael Ian Black on Twitter.  Yes.  Is your book out now?  No, it comes out in February.  Oh, okay.  We'll see you before then.  All right.  All right, cool.  Guy Fieri next, maybe with Michael Ian Black.  You never know.  Stay there.  Sirius XM.  This is the virus.  Coming up on the next episode of The Spectacular Suicide, the notorious villain, Angerman, is hurling 
[02:32:30]  helpless children from the windows of the Lil' Leopard's Orphanage to the streets below.  Who can stop this deranged, diabolical, demented mastermind?  You know, I...  Nobody can stop me.  I'm invincible.  Come here, little Timmy. 
[02:33:00]  Would you like to see if you can fly?  Come on, stupid door.  I'm kicking you.  Now open.  Oh, wait.  Doorknob.  Stop it right there, Angerman.  Suicide.  That's right. 
[02:33:30]  Hey.  Hey, right where you are.  Don't come any closer, or I'll throw another hopeless child to the streets below.  This ends right now, Angerman.  Leave those children alone, or I'll...  Or you'll...  What?  What?  Um, what?  What?  Okay, okay, bye. 
[02:34:00]  That's what I thought.  Up, up, and away!  Oh, crap.  I forgot.  I can't fly!  Get down!  My leg!  Us.  Us.  Us.  Us.  Us.  I'm...  By us.  By us.  Us.  Us.  Us.  Us.  Us. 
[02:34:30]  Turn.  Statement.  Us.  I'm on...  I'm unstoppable.  I'm unstoppable.  Stay tuned for another episode of the Spectacular Suicide, where Police Commissioner Vic Dumb calls  upon suicide to stop another diabolical villain.  Is this us? 
[02:35:00]  We are live from the fishbowl.  You guys could say yay or something.  We got the couch of zilches in the fishbowl.  Guy Fieri in front of us.  A man of his word, by the way.  Yeah.  You are a man of your word.  I said I will be back, and when I come back, I'm going to cook food.  Yeah.  And I have brought the onslaught.  I brought my kid.  I brought a couple of my chefs.  I brought everything.  And you guys, seriously, if someone doesn't pass out the next 45 minutes, I'm not doing my job right.  Yeah. 
[02:35:30]  This smells amazing.  Yeah, he wanted to bring strippers, but what happened with that?  He got caught at security.  That was awkward.  Because of Hunter, right?  Yeah, exactly.  Hunter blew the whole stripper thing because he's too young for that.  Well, they heard the one meh, and then things got all weird.  It smells amazing in here.  Yeah.  Who actually cooked the food, by the way?  Because I think you just arrived.  No, don't.  Don't sell out.  I think you were going to get all the credit for this.  This is how we start the friendship training.  I get sold out already?  I know your guys have been here since 4 in the morning. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, that is actually the truth.  Because Roland had to be here at 4 in the morning.  This is actually a line of steaks and sausages that I make that's under the Guy Fieri line.  And we sell it all over the country.  Costco, the folks at Costco dialed us in.  We said, oh, by the way, we'll be in New York tomorrow.  Can you send us a bunch?  So you got Bloody Mary flank steak, and you got rosemary tri-tip, and the whole giddy-up.  So Hunter's going to actually dial you in.  This is some of the Bloody Mary flank steak with some peppers.  And I brought cocktails. 
[02:36:30]  No, take it to these guys.  Don't feed.  You already fed.  Hunter, you already fed the lions.  Don't.  All right.  Can I make a cocktail?  Thank you very much.  Do whatever you want.  The blender's going to sound awesome on the radio.  Yeah, we love blenders on the radio.  So the last time we hung out, and by the way.  Hey, Hunter.  What am I?  Chopped liver here.  Yeah, Hunter, that didn't go over so big.  Holy shit.  Is it good?  Oh, yeah.  It's actually flank steak.  Wow.  Oh, okay. 
[02:37:00]  No, so when we hung out, and we had this conversation, and the show was the bomb, and so I leave,  and I had, I don't know, a variety of other visits around New York, and I'm not kidding  you.  I must have had a hundred.  This is no bullshit.  A hundred people walk up to me and go, oh, I heard you on Open Anthem.  I mean, it was like.  That's all of our listeners.  Well, I'm going to tell you something.  It was pretty off the hook, so I knew when I'd run my mouth and said that I'll be  back with food, I had to go big or go home, so I went home, and then I came back big. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, you did.  It's really delicious.  Is it good, Jimmy?  God, I can't wait to try it.  I need a napkin.  Really?  I'm a blob.  There's going to be a variety of samplings today, so make sure you save room.  Oh, bless you.  Hey, what's up with these sauces in front of you as you, to make something in the blender?  Now, we've got, so here's the thing.  When we launched the book, and we didn't really talk about all this other stuff that we've  got going on, but we've got this company called Gia Russo that's actually here in New  York, and so we make, we've got four different sauces, four different barbecue sauces, but 
[02:38:00]  let's not even talk about this.  Why?  Why not?  Well, because I want to make a cocktail.  If I get you guys loaded, then we'll really start laying out the smack.  Did you guys get to eat anything?  Oh.  Yeah, only one guy?  Oh, you do too.  The cute girl and the one guy that was here early that raised his hand.  Oh, my God.  So that's Bloody Mary.  What that is, is that's it.  You take a Bloody Mary cocktail with the vodka and the whole giddy up, and the horseradish  and the garlic and tomato and the Worcestershire and the whole thing, and you marinate the  flank steak in it, and then you let it go for about two days.  Well, this company that we work with in California, we marinate it for 28 days. 
[02:38:30]  It's put in a package, and you get it, and I mean, can you taste it?  I mean, it is.  It's amazing, yeah.  Okay.  So it's crazy good.  Now, this wicked concoction that I'm making is called a JR5050, and my buddy Dustin, who's  standing here, and I think someone in the studio, his wife calls me and says, I had this crazy  drink when I was in, I don't know, someplace, and it tasted like a 50-50 bar, but it had 
[02:39:00]  booze in it, and I got a little loaded from it.  Can you make one?  So I went into the kitchen and started knocking this out.  Yeah, so you got ice cream, orange juice concentrate, a little champagne, and some vodka.  Wow.  Yeah, that doesn't suck.  Yeah, I could tell right away.  That's a culinary term, by the way.  All right, let me see if I can figure out how to do this.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, rather impressive.  Yeah, we're going to be drinking.  All right. 
[02:39:30]  Wow.  I just want to say right now, I'll be seeing everybody, I guess, Monday for the show.  Oh, boy.  You just shut us up there, guy.  How's that, guy?  That's good.  Oh, it does not suck.  Oh, man.  I can't drink alcohol.  Oh, cool.  I had a lot of problems.  Well, you can, but it would just be really bad if you did.  My headphones are going in and out.  What happened?  I don't know.  The equipment just doesn't work.  Really?  I actually found out that I was allergic to tequila. 
[02:40:00]  They're going in and out.  Yeah.  When I was in college, every time I'd drink tequila, I'd break into handcuffs.  You know, just, it was...  I knew something was going to happen.  I'll be here all week.  Not really, but just for the next half an hour.  I woke up with bathroom tile marks on my face.  Talk to God in that big white telephone?  Yes.  Tequila is one of the worst things.  I think that's everybody's first real screw-up.  You know what it is?  It's good tequila.  It's not.  That's the thing. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah, but if that is, who can afford the good stuff?  Okay.  Here we go.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Can I make you one without vodka?  Yeah, Hunter.  I'll just jump right into that.  Okay.  Give me another cup here, because I...  Do you make them without alcohol at all?  Yeah.  Why?  So Hunter and I could have one.  I think you're kind of missing the point on that, though, brother.  No, but I will tell you, that was the show that we did.  Thanks for the help with the promo on the book. 
[02:41:00]  The show we did, I still laugh.  That was one of the best times.  So, I don't know.  That was great.  I was a little shocked when I walked in.  We have a fishbowl.  We got a bunch of people eating and licking the windows.  That's awkward.  But what a good time, man.  You guys are some cats.  All right, pass.  That's fun.  And Marie.  Marie is the fiancée of one of my culinary guys, Carl.  Carl stands outside, and I bring Marie in, just so you guys...  That's a little better, yeah.  We appreciate that.  Yeah.  Oh, look at her.  Got her nice black serving ware and cooking ware on. 
[02:41:30]  I'll have to give mine to somebody.  Roland?  Oh, my God.  Taste that in.  I'd love to taste it all, but I can't.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  Give it to one of those guys.  Give it to the big guy that's not going to throttle me.  It tastes like one of those creamsicles.  Yeah, the 50-50 bar.  But, wow, with a punch.  Holy mother of God.  You sure do like your vodka.  I got a little heavy-handed in that.  I'm sorry.  Oh, you did a little bit.  There's a lot of vodka in this there, guys.  Yeah, no, not so much. 
[02:42:00]  I mean, what, half a bottle?  I mean, like...  All right.  It's not like I've got to drive too far.  Yeah.  All right.  So, some sausages.  So, this is...  So, we made these sausages.  When the guys from the meat company, we started talking about food, they said, well, what kind  of sausage recipes do you want to go with?  I said, well, how about we do like a Cajun sausage, so we have the onion sausage, named  after one of my Cajun buddies, and we did apricot sesame, and then I started getting real  weird sausages, like egg roll.  So, we made a sausage called the egg roll sausage.  It tastes like an egg roll, but made into a sausage. 
[02:42:30]  This right here is called apricot sesame, and I think...  You know, I don't know...  The Costco out here in New York, I don't know if they're carrying it all yet, but the  Costco out in Cali, they're rocking the whole line.  Damn.  Yeah.  I told you I was coming back.  You've taken off.  I told you I was coming back.  Oh, yeah.  Everybody says that just to get away from us.  Yeah, that is true.  Nobody actually comes back.  No one ever does that.  All right, Hunter.  Pass the appetizer.  This sandwich is phenomenal. 
[02:43:00]  Isn't that good?  I'm so happy I'm eating this in front of people who can't have it.  See the kid getting that...  I know.  He's like, them or them?  Cruise the panel, and then feed the lions.  Yeah.  We could be shoving that...  Oh, thank you, Hunter.  What does Hunter want to be when he grows up there, guy?  The Easter bunny.  I don't know.  You don't even know?  Hunter's going into high school.  Hunter's going into high school.  So he was...  This is our last run.  He's going to the...  He doesn't know this, but he's going to the Mets game this afternoon.  Oh.  Yeah.  I love that.  So he's getting hooked up with that.  Then we're bouncing out of New York, going to Chi-Town tomorrow. 
[02:43:30]  He's going to go hit the Cubs game.  Wow.  And then he's going to Lollapalooza for the weekend, so...  Damn.  Yeah.  Wow, you are hooked up.  Yeah, right?  What'd your father do before you went to high school, Ant?  I don't know.  He yelled at my mother through spaghetti at the wall.  No.  Sam has one.  I don't even give a fuck if this sounds good right now.  Oh, who cares?  I'm sure people would be like, what is there eating on the radio? 
[02:44:00]  Yes.  Yeah, we are.  And drinking.  Are we on the radio yet?  Oh, yeah.  It's great.  Yeah, no, I'm making one without alcohol.  Ah, look at that.  You might want to know that.  What's that?  Without alcohol.  They didn't wash that.  I need some water, Marie.  No.  Jimmy needs to know that.  That's right.  Thank you.  Wow, the sausage is good.  I usually hate sausage.  This is phenomenal.  Hey, where's your one buddy that doesn't eat anything?  Sam.  Nothing?  Listen, dude, I brought the onslaught.  I'm going to get grilled cheese if I have to. 
[02:44:30]  But we got to.  How about toast and butter?  I mean, anything.  Sam, you got to try the steak.  If you could get him to like steak, your business, not that it needs the help, is going to go through that.  It doesn't matter, Sam.  We fed him the best steak in New York, and he hated it.  It didn't work when a wrestler fed me.  You got to taste his sandwich.  Yeah, the sandwich is pretty gangster, dude.  Well, I'm not going to be able to eat it, and then I'm going to make.  I don't want a guy to have a bad burger.  Look, are you okay with the fact that he might not like it?  No, I'm totally fine with that.  And the reason he's not going to like it is because he's a idiot.  You see the size of that guy right there? 
[02:45:00]  Going to take him outside if he doesn't like it.  Fake it.  Can you try a bite of the sandwich?  It's not going to work.  It doesn't matter what it tastes like.  Take a bite of it.  I'll take a bite.  It's not going to work.  You have nice tattoos on your feet.  You want to try the sausage?  I don't eat sausage either.  You don't eat sausage?  Oh, no.  I don't eat anything good.  You want to shoot some vodka?  No.  Yeah, come on.  He doesn't drink.  He doesn't eat steak.  He doesn't eat sausage.  Yeah, water.  Hunter's in on him now.  Take water.  Hunter's getting on his ass.  You're not going to try anything for the show? 
[02:45:30]  For the show.  For the show.  Well, I'll do it if you want.  It's not going to work.  For the show.  What are those on your feet, madam?  Are those like little puma steps?  Oh, yes.  They're my gunner.  It's claw prints on your foot.  Claw prints?  Oh, tattooed?  Does your husband there mind that you have those?  No.  I was just seeing if you were with him.  I friggin', you know what?  Smooth.  I was like, the second you said that, I'm like, that's such an ulterior motive.  I know what he's doing.  Okay, what do you guys want next? 
[02:46:00]  Oh, man.  Well, what you got?  Yeah, I'll eat anything.  You could surprise us.  E-Rock's had to be chained like King Kong with high-tensile steel chains.  Yeah, we got the opposite of Sam, Guy, if you want to meet him.  E-Rock, come on in.  Yeah.  No, you know what?  I got off the elevator, and he says, I've already had some of the sausage.  Oh, of course.  That was Roland.  That's Roland.  No, Roland's another one.  Yeah, E-Rock's eating partner.  E-Rock right there is, wow, does he like his food.  Yeah.  All right, there you go. 
[02:46:30]  There's some non-alcoholic version of the JR 50-50.  All right, let's bust out.  So, let me bring this out.  Now, this is the Santa Maria tri-tip down by Santa Barbara in California.  There's an area called Santa Maria, and they make this tri-tip that is just a little bit of garlic and tomato and some onion.  Hey, I'm a dummy.  What's a tri-tip?  No, you're not a dummy.  I've never heard of it before.  Here's what happens.  Bernie Williams, by the way.  Are you a Yankees fan?  That's Bernie Williams, yeah.  Just walk by. 
[02:47:00]  Tell Bernie to come over and get a sandwich.  Bernie, you want a bite of food?  They have to run out, but he's going to a charity event.  Oh, well, maybe he could try a piece of the tri-tip.  What is tri-tip?  Tri-tip on the east of the Mississippi.  East of the Mississippi, you guys don't find it very often, but it's a cut of meat from the sirloin area of the beef.  You know, from the back of the beef.  And this is, depending on how you carve a steer, you know, when you break it down, whether or not you get the tri-tip out of it.  You got one on each side. 
[02:47:30]  It's not riddled with fat, but it's got a good marbling of fat.  It's tri-tip.  It looks like a triangle.  When you cut it, you cook it about medium rare, and you cut it on the bias.  And I'm going to tell you something.  You will be blown away by the flavor, and you're going to start asking your butcher to knock you out some tri-tip.  I can't believe it.  Sorry, Guy.  I can't believe it came back.  Bernie Williams came back.  Hey, Bernie.  Bernie Williams, everyone.  How you doing?  Guy Fieri.  There you go.  You know Guy?  You seen Guy?  Yeah.  Why don't you mic him, E-Rock?  E-Rock.  Okay, good.  Big fan. 
[02:48:00]  Bernie.  We want you to try some steak before you leave.  Oh, my goodness.  I'll be honored.  You got what?  A music album out?  Yeah, we have a music album out.  We have actually a book out called Rhythms of the Game, and we're doing some work with Maxwell House, revitalizing some of the community centers, working at the Millbrook Community Center in New York today.  Hey, look at you, you do-gooder.  That's all right.  Hey, man.  I was good home trained.  Yeah.  That's good. 
[02:48:30]  Parents taught me well.  Boy, did I want to just yell about...  I remember watching a World Series and just hearing...  Behind home plate.  Was that someone you knew?  That was certainly someone I heard.  Did you catch much flack about that?  Oh, well, not too much.  Flack, flack, flack, flack, flack, flack, flack, flack, flack.  Not too much, man.  I'm watching the game.  Especially when you strike out, though.  Yeah, you know. 
[02:49:00]  Thank you for having me, guys.  All right, no problem.  Take the sandwich, have fun.  Thank you so much.  I know you're a busy man.  Take care, guys.  I want to hear a bite of this thing.  Did he get a bite of this?  Yeah, just try a bite.  I only gave him a half, so it's going to be one bite.  That is really good.  Oh, yeah.  Pull the microphone out of his face.  I know.  He's not going to eat that.  He's not your radio.  We understand.  Hey, brother.  Thanks, Bernie.  That's fantastic.  Yeah, let's try that shit.  I'd like some more, Hunter.  We got to do this more often. 
[02:49:30]  Thank you, Hunter.  You're a good boy.  I'm going to bring meat of the month.  I understand, Hunter.  These two wanted it first.  No, no, no.  Take the nice one.  I like the butt end.  Jimmy just took the shitty one.  Not that it's shitty.  I mean, it was the end of a roll.  Sorry.  That was cool.  No, you don't like the heel?  I like the heel.  We fight in my family for that.  It's a tri-tip.  Jimmy's used to a bi-tip.  What do you mean?  I'm implying that a bisexual man puts the tip of his penis in your mouth.  Hey, Hunter.  There's a little boy here.  All Hunter's going to do is take this material back to high school. 
[02:50:00]  What are you talking about?  Exactly.  Yay.  Well, the tri-tip is a hit.  Holy shit.  Isn't that great?  Wow.  I mean, just real subtle flavors of the garlic and the tomato and the onion and a little  bit of paprika and some cayenne, some salt and pepper.  I could tell all the drunks sitting there because they're just looking like, Tim, I wish I had  a drink.  Yeah.  This is great.  Okay.  So we load that up.  Now, guys, what I'm putting on here. 
[02:50:30]  Hey, if you don't mind herpes, you can have the rest of mine.  All right.  Here you go.  Can't get it twice in the same week, right?  That's right, guys.  You tell them.  And with that much vodka in it, I don't think anything would live.  Believe me.  Wow.  That's good.  What are we promoting, guys?  Nothing.  I just came back to cook.  No, no, no.  Seriously, no bullshit.  I said that I was going to come back.  I was in town.  Actually, what happened is-  I'll ask this.  Are the recipes in this book of yours?  Some of them are.  The Bloody Mary Flank Steak's in there.  Okay.  But if you don't want to make it, you go to Costco or Kroger's or Sam's Club or something 
[02:51:00]  like that, and you'll be able to find it.  But no, the deal was this.  Hunter and I were in- I was in town shooting a show with Rachel Ray.  Rachel Ray and I did a new show called Celebrity Cook-Off, and we thought we were going to  shoot on Wednesday.  We found out that we weren't going to be shooting, and I said, well, we've got a free day in New  York, which I never have because I'm usually packed with something going somewhere  else.  And I said, call the boys.  Let's see if I can come back and cook.  I love it.  So we brought the wagon train together, and here we is.  And made it work.  That is fantastic, man. 
[02:51:30]  Are you starting this yet?  You know what?  Danny needs a bite.  This is like a great boat drink or a drink out by the pool.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or a good wake-up.  I'm hungover.  Give me some of that drink with the sugar.  Yeah, because it's all cool and nice and not intrusive.  You should see the one I make with Pepto-Bismol.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pepto-Jegger and six Vicodin.  You know, you could just tell Guy knows how to party, man. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's called the Winehouse.  Oh.  Yeah.  You don't talk about this stuff on Minute to Win it there, Guy.  No, it doesn't come out necessarily like that each time.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a family show, isn't it?  Ah, yeah.  There we go.  Okay.  Something tells me Guy knows how to have a good time on a weekend.  I've never eaten food.  Well, I own restaurants in Cali.  I own five restaurants.  Getting ready to open my sixth.  We're going to open another Johnny Garlic's down in Dublin.  No, not Island.  People say, are you calling it International?  Yeah, right.  Oh.  But down by San Francisco or actually by Oakland.  But this is the kind of food we do. 
[02:52:30]  I mean, I love big flavors.  I like handmade food.  I mean, we scratch make just about everything in our restaurants.  And so when these guys from this meat company from Golden West said, hey, we want to take  some of your flavors and your food we want to make.  Ah, no, no, no.  I'm not into that, man.  That's not my gig.  So these guys show up to do a tasting in front of 40 of my friends and my family.  And they rock it out, man.  They make the real deal.  It's great.  Danny, what do you think?  It's amazing, right?  I've never eaten food from a celebrity chef before.  I ate in Gordon Ramsay's restaurant in L.A.  I didn't care for it.  This is amazing. 
[02:53:00]  Well, here's the funny thing.  I've never cooked on a radio show.  I was in Bahrain.  I was in Bahrain.  I was cooking for the troops in a radio show, and one of the military shows asked me to  come on and cook.  And so I had like a little skillet, and I'm cooking like eggs or something.  This is horrible.  In a helmet.  Yeah, exactly.  Full riot gear.  But when I talked to my...  This is Carl, by the way, the crazy Cuban.  Uh-huh.  Hey.  What's up, Carl?  He's getting ready to open a restaurant in New York.  He's getting ready to get called Marie's, which is after his wife or his fiancee.  This dude can cook.  Next time you guys need someone to come and cook if I'm not in town, this guy can throw it down. 
[02:53:30]  By the way, Roland is standing outside grabbing things before they get into the room.  Yes!  Have you noticed that?  It's a security checkpoint.  He's intercepting everything before it even gets in the room.  Roland, get on, Mike.  You're amazing, Roland.  What do you think of the food?  Yeah, Roland, you're an expert.  I'm so happy today.  You didn't sleep last night.  This is like Christmas for you, right?  It really is, right?  This is Christmas.  This is the best day ever.  He didn't sleep.  Yeah.  Oh, I would rather have a little piece of the steak.  Thank you. 
[02:54:00]  I'll have both.  Thank you.  I'll have any of you.  Phenomenal.  Hold on.  Roland stole my plate.  He just left.  He did.  He took my plate.  I put my plate down and he just picked it up and walked.  It was empty.  It's the news you lose.  He just left.  Guy, can I have just a couple of slices of that steak?  I would love to just try that.  Absolutely.  I didn't get any on the...  Oh, you didn't get the tri-tip?  No, no.  You didn't get the sandwich yet?  The tri-tips were good.  No, no.  I just want to try some of it without the bread.  I just want to taste the steak alone.  Yeah, this is...  And here's the thing.  This is cone of meat. 
[02:54:30]  You remember something about Mary?  It's like, you know, they don't have enough meat on a stick.  They don't have enough cone of meat.  So here's a tubbo sausage.  There you are.  No, that was for you.  Well, just something for...  Yeah, yeah, Roland.  ...between commercials.  You can just, you know...  Yeah.  Not that you have any, but...  Are we feeding these guys, too?  Oh, yeah.  We're trying to.  Screw them.  As fast as I can cut it and shovel it over to you guys, and your team's intercepting it.  Who over there hasn't gotten anything?  Oh, they've been eating.  Cool.  Okay, good.  Good to know.  I meant STD-wise.  Not one hand went up. 
[02:55:00]  This is exactly...  Logistically, this is exactly like when the U.S. tried to feed the Somalis, and Roland's  the warlord.  Nothing's getting through.  Warlord.  I love a good political food joke, even if it isn't a joke.  Yeah, I know.  It's so political.  Okay, what I just made you there was a little...  Put a little gremolata on this, and then I'm also making you a little horseradish. 
[02:55:30]  Put it on a lot of gremolittle.  But seriously, Johnny.  Take that over to him.  Oh, chip, cool me out.  Anybody cocktail-free yet?  Anybody need...  Oh, my God.  Who's up?  For what?  Anybody?  We good?  You guys need more meat?  More carnage?  No?  Both?  Fantastic.  Yes.  All right, let me get you another one here.  Okay.  How's the bread?  Oh, yeah, we had it on the side. 
[02:56:00]  How's that?  With the gremolata on the side of that?  Oh, yeah.  So you got garlic and peppers and onions all mixed together, a little vinegar in there,  and then I made you a little horseradish sour cream with some garlic on the side.  Last night, we had the wrap party for the Rachel vs. Guy show.  And so we went to Darby over on 14th.  Great joint, man.  Alex Connoisselli's place.  So I went in there, and I said to the crew, I said, I'm going to cook, you know, everybody.  I'm going to cook, make some food.  And so Hunter was in there.  The kitchen's about as big as this table is.  So we're in there, and these guys are slammed. 
[02:56:30]  The dining room's busy, and we're knocking out.  And that's, you know, cooking for people, to me, is the best way to say thank you,  and is the best way to, you know, you don't come to somebody's house and not bring something with you.  I'm Italian.  That's what you do.  So I made a similar dish with that, but we used fresh horseradish.  Anytime you get a chance to make a sour cream horseradish, like if you're doing prime rib,  it's the holidays or something, use fresh horseradish.  It will blow your mind how it's not so vinegary, strong, snappy.  It's just a really nice amount with great flavor.  We used some fresh horseradish. 
[02:57:00]  You like cooking, though.  I'm so self-centered and lazy.  I don't like doing that much stuff for other people.  I would just want to eat it.  You actually enjoy making other people feel good with food?  Oh, man.  It's the greatest.  I mean, certain people have certain things.  You know, like we were listening to Coolio and Joey Fatone.  They were both on the show, and these guys are sitting there singing, and the crowd's going bananas.  I'm like, God, I wish I could sing.  All I can do is cook.  So you stick at what you're good at, right?  But, you know, you cook.  You cook.  You really know how to do it.  I always sit there going, is it done yet? 
[02:57:30]  I don't even know.  It's in the oven.  I'm like, it could be raw in the middle.  It could be burnt.  I have no clue.  You know, a digital thermometer, believe it or not, as much as it sounds like it's cheating,  is probably one of the greatest pieces of equipment that you can have.  Rectal or oral?  Well, don't put the mercury one into this.  Yeah, why can't they be both?  I assume you just sit there with a thermometer in you.  But you remember that when we were kids, you had that thermometer?  Nowadays, we put it with a little thing in the ear.  Yes.  You know?  Yeah.  I prefer the old one.  My five-year-old rider would go bananas, man, if we tried to take it. 
[02:58:00]  We had to literally put poison and glass in our mouths.  Yes.  And hold it there.  Yes.  In our assholes.  Yeah.  It was more in the air.  Yeah.  Ours had a fist on it.  I just lost Guy with that one.  Jimmy.  Hunter, you better go down the hallway.  Yeah.  Disney Channel's around the corner.  Oh, my God. 
[02:58:30]  Where's Z-Rock?  How's he eating?  Oh, of course.  Of course he is.  Look at him chewing as he comes in.  He actually knocked the guy down with a crowbar and took the plate.  He's got a beer cup filled with me.  I was about to say, Eric's currently enjoying a pint of sausage.  Boy, am I.  You're not supposed to drink it, Eric.  He has a pint of sausage.  How good is it?  Fucking fantastic.  Language.  Isn't it great?  Language.  Hunter's right there.  It does drive you to curse.  Don't curse in front of the boy.  All right, Hunter. 
[02:59:00]  Take this over to him.  If we give him things, they won't say bad words.  Okay.  Now, this right here is the garlic and rosemary tri-tip.  Jesus.  He's right, man.  We're going to roll out of here.  I know.  Get some homemade Italian hot peppers there.  Go ahead and feed the lions with that.  Anybody need a new cocktail?  Go that way a little.  Huh?  Yeah.  I'll have a little bit.  Thank you, Hunter.  Oh, there's some rosemary.  Thank you.  I'll have another one of those.  I'll have two.  Fuck. 
[02:59:30]  The drink, goddammit.  Hold on.  Was I too heavy on the vodka last time, guys?  Because I just need to know where to go back to.  No, that was good for me.  Pull that back.  I didn't mind it.  All right, good.  I told you to bring the 175 of this, Marie.  It's so good.  Wow.  This is very good meat.  I'd love to hear that once in my life.  But here's the cool thing about it.  You know, everybody's so busy, and I'm trying to get people with, you know, cooking at home,  cooking with their kids.  That's a big thing.  That's right.  That's actually one of the things I do with Hunter a lot is cook with him and bringing 
[03:00:00]  him here to cook.  He said, can I just stay in, you know, stay at the apartment?  Doing this as a family.  Now, not everybody has the time to marinate a piece of meat for, you know, two days and  really get that flavor in there.  So that's why we did these raw meats that you can buy that are marinated, and all you  got to do is grill them up.  You slice them the right way.  You serve it with a nice, you know, accoutrement, you know, along with it.  But the deal is, man, we got to quit buying processed foods.  We got to quit buying frozen, fried, already done, stick it in the microwave, and you got  a six-course meal stuff.  That's crap. 
[03:00:30]  Exactly.  Yeah.  Okay, so champagne, vodka, orange juice concentrate, and a little vanilla ice cream.  Isn't that good?  Or some more vanilla ice cream.  Yeah, Roland's digging that cup.  Look at you, Roland.  Roland's in heaven.  I know.  Usually you have to sneak into the bathroom and get drunk during work.  It's in the open today.  He loves that.  Yeah, it's really great.  Roland really is spectating like it's some kind of a sport that you could behold.  What about Kenny?  Is he going to try any meat? 
[03:01:00]  Kenny, why don't you have something?  I'm fasting.  Sorry, guy.  We work with a lot of weirdos.  Kenny, you're too big to fast, dude.  You can't.  You could.  Religious purposes.  And Sam's like a try any meat.  This is for delicious purposes.  Sam, just try something.  Why won't it work?  Maybe this time it works.  Oh, what is that, Hunter?  It's just chicken nuggets.  Oh, Hunter.  Give it to them.  Give it to them first.  You're like a little baby.  Kenny, you want something?  Get fasting over there.  The Cheerios you had, was it a bowl, or did they just put a handful in front of it? 
[03:01:30]  One of you, on the table.  You get to pick off of them.  Or you go to a feeder.  Yeah.  You should be eating homeos.  Hey, who's the woman, the booker?  Who is she?  Because she was hungry.  She wanted something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The booker.  She brought me in to meet Bernie, so I promised her some food.  That was cool.  Yeah.  That was cool seeing Bernie.  It looks good, huh?  Yeah.  I bargained with somebody else's food.  You did.  To get a picture with Bernie Williams.  Oh, you got a picture with him?  You were piffing out my food before I even got here? 
[03:02:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got a ball sign, a picture.  I didn't even know he was going to be here today.  Which one?  Left or right?  I don't think I'm on the right side.  I don't know.  The right.  I got a ball sign.  You're an ass.  Oh, that is one of my favorites now.  I love blender drinks.  I've never seen anybody do the show lying on the floor before.  This is awesome.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You guys are amazing.  Believe me, I'm in a food coma and hopefully an alcohol coma soon enough. 
[03:02:30]  Usually he drinks in the bathroom.  I can't get over that.  That's great.  That's the best one.  What about Troy Kwan?  Troy.  You trying the food?  Troy.  Oh, man.  You got to get on that.  My crunch.  What's wrong with you?  I tried a little bit of the sausage earlier.  You got to get it.  It'll make your hair stay.  Oh.  Oh, this is good stuff.  My God.  All right.  Look.  Screw the food.  Give me another drink. 
[03:03:00]  No, get out of there.  Wait a minute.  Okay, so this is like Thursday.  Make it Friday.  It's called drinking rationalization.  Actually, it's Wednesday.  Thursday?  Yeah, but technically it feels like a Thursday, which is the other Friday.  Oh, please.  Refill that, motherfucker.  All right.  There we go.  So, what do you guys think so far?  Have I answered the call? 
[03:03:30]  Oh, hell yeah.  Please.  How did we get in a fishbowl, too?  I thought we were going to be back in the other street.  I thought we were going to be cooking in the hallway.  That would have been bad.  What was your favorite so far, besides the cocktail and Hunter talking smack?  Actually, the last meat that Hunter brought around.  The rosemary.  That was the rosemary garlic tri-tip.  That was so good.  My favorite was the sandwich because it had the sauce on it.  The horseradish stuff.  Bloody Mary sauce. 
[03:04:00]  The saucy sauce.  Yeah, it was very good.  The horseradish.  Oh, priced on a pony.  That's good.  I love eating meat.  Lots and lots of meat.  Isolate that.  Everybody's full except a couple of people.  Sam.  Sam.  And you're still eating out of his cup of meat.  Sam, come on.  Just have one piece.  He's got the straw in the cup of meat.  We know it's not going to change anything.  We know you're going to.  I mean, I'm not going to be able to digest it.  Yes, you will.  What do you mean?  You can't even swallow it, guy. 
[03:04:30]  What are you, a cow?  Yeah, exactly.  Digest it?  No.  We had McFoley from the WWE feed Sam steak, and he still was.  He was on.  Weren't you sitting on his lap?  Yeah.  No, I was sitting next to him.  He fed Sam steak the same way Sam feeds his dog peanut butter.  Another peanut butter joke.  Of course.  I don't have a dog.  Are we up to our quota for the day?  No.  Can we give Sam one little bite there, guy?  Okay.  One little steak.  I'm going to cut you the optimum piece. 
[03:05:00]  Yes.  One bite.  And I'm going to cut it like a baby bird would have it.  Just like a little.  Actually regurgitate it into his mouth, could you?  That would be great.  He would fly over like a bird or something.  You know his mom would do it for him.  Oh, of course.  If your mommy was here, she would do that for you.  I want to save my little boy's teeth.  I'm going to pre-chew everything for him.  Sam, you want any of the spices or any of the sauces?  Okay, Hunter.  I don't think it'll make a difference.  Hunter is going to be the one administering the, no, on the spoon, Hunter.  I don't want him to.  Guy, this might be bad for business.  I'm just telling you.  Okay, hang on. 
[03:05:30]  Hang on.  Can we do it?  Come on.  Do you?  Yo, he's got the trash can all over there already.  This is not going to work.  Can we bring in a stunt double?  Yeah.  This is not a nut.  De-reflection of your cooking.  Okay, then let's not spit it out.  Hunter, you taste it and you tell me what it tastes like.  No, let Sam do it.  Oh, this is going to be good.  Sam, but Sam doesn't like any meat.  It's all meat.  He won't eat meat.  Hold on.  The way to give it to him, though, is to put it on your fist and just put it in his mouth  really quick.  Yeah, put it between your knuckles.  Punch it into his teeth.  Okay, Sam.  Literally a knuckle sandwich.  This is going to be a big deal. 
[03:06:00]  If you enjoy this, you know there could be a vacation to California involved in this.  Come out to Cali.  Put some weight on you.  I enjoyed it.  You know.  Sam.  Go ahead, Sam.  Come on, Sam.  Just take it.  Chew it.  Everyone else loves it.  Get the flavor.  It's good.  You're going to love it.  It's fantastic.  I just want to take a little piece of it.  It's a big bite.  Oh, my God.  You're an infant.  You're like a child.  No, I just don't want to take a half a bite.  Take a bite half of it, you dope. 
[03:06:30]  No one says you have to swallow the whole thing.  I'm not going to be able to do it.  Yes, you will.  Just nibble it.  That's what your incisors are for.  Amazing, right?  Why don't you use them and cut a piece of meat in half with it?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what mother would do.  That's what mother would do.  It is.  And by the way, it's fitting.  It's fitting on a plastic spoon, a little plastic spoon.  He's shaking.  He is.  Put it down here.  Put it here.  God only knows what happened in his youth that he doesn't want to put any meat in his mouth. 
[03:07:00]  Hey, before we end my culinary career, can we ask some of your panel of esteemed judges what they think of the meat?  Yes.  Get the mic over there by some of our audience here.  What do you think of that?  You've had some.  I think it was very delicious.  Very delicious.  And you got yourself a knuckle sandwich t-shirt, which is nice.  Yeah.  See?  Look at that.  What a personality on him.  Very delicious.  Don Corleone, I enjoy your meat. 
[03:07:30]  I was lucky to get any because I was sitting in between these two big guys.  When there was only two pieces coming by, I figured I'd let them have it.  Yeah, yeah.  Keep your hands and feet away from the hopper.  It was right there.  Give it to him, Dangerfield.  I love it.  It was awesome.  Very good.  Yeah.  What about the young lady?  That is a...  Oh, well, yes.  Oh, well, hello there.  It was delicious.  Wow.  Talk more about it.  Where are you from?  Jersey or Long Island?  Long Island.  Yeah, I figured.  Right all from a... 
[03:08:00]  It was delicious.  I could tell she was from Long Island.  South Shore, right?  North or east?  De'a Park.  De'a Park.  De'a Park is considered South Shore.  Well, it's in the middle.  That's considered South Shore.  It's right on the border.  It's south of the Mason-Dixon line.  How do you spell that?  De'a Park.  De'a Park.  Ah, go fuck yourself.  Language.  Well, that's the favorite thing.  There's a young lad here.  For them to say on Long Island.  We stalled enough.  Oh, I thought you meant Sam.  Sam, it's time to try Guy Fieri's meat.  Yeah.  How much?  Do you know...  What'd you do?  Is he just flavored the spoon with it?  What do you do? 
[03:08:30]  Do you even have any?  I know.  Yeah, look at that.  But it's all meat.  He just can't eat meat.  Guy, don't take this as a personal insult.  No, I'm not.  I'm not.  You have...  No, you've got to work through this.  How about...  You want to choke it down with a roll or some bread?  Yeah.  You like bread?  Yeah.  I love bread.  Oh, there we go.  There we go.  See, now we're working together.  Yeah.  This is good.  Do you want me to mash it up or anything?  No, I can soak it in more milk, anything like that.  I can...  Yeah, take a little piece of the bread.  Don't give it the whole roll.  You're not eating the whole roll.  Oh, no, no.  I don't need...  We don't need one roll for...  A teeny sliver.  Maybe that's like an eighth of an ounce of... 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  It's a sliver from my tongue.  Okay, Hunter, take that over there to him so you can...  Be a little piece of it.  I'm not going to put it...  I wouldn't put any sauce or anything like that on it.  Yeah.  Whisper of...  There you go.  This is what happens when somebody is coddled as a baby instead of punched.  That's a ration for a plane-crashed rugby team.  I know.  See?  Steve McQueen ate more than Papillon.  Guy...  It's like a workout, man.  I think I pulled some fat.  This video isn't going to make you look good, so I do want to say ahead of time, 
[03:09:30]  everyone else enjoyed your meal.  Everyone loves it.  He just hates steak.  Hey, you're going to do good with this.  I'm going to wrap that in a 50 if you can bring it back over here.  Let's go, Sam.  Come on.  It's time.  Come on, Sam.  You can do this.  Come on, Sam.  You can do this.  Go ahead.  Just eat it.  Just eat it.  Don't look at it.  It's wonderful.  Man up.  It's so goddamn good.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  Just pretend you're eating it through a hole in the wall in the rest area.  You want to chug it down with some vodka?  It doesn't drink either.  That's ridiculous.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now I'm over it.  Go ahead, Sam.  Come on, Sam.  You can do it.  And you've got to chew it.  It's delicious. 
[03:10:00]  It's all in your head.  It's ridiculous.  You best not make these faces with Jess.  I could see him just going.  Yeah.  He keeps shoving his head under the covers.  He's like wrestling cartoons.  Could you wrap it in bread?  Nothing against Jess.  I love the girl.  No, it's against him.  Of course it is.  Sam.  Sam.  Yeah, eat it.  Sam.  Let's go.  You're the man.  It's delicious, Sam.  No, come on.  You didn't even get it in your mouth. 
[03:10:30]  You didn't even get it in your mouth.  You bit it in half and spit out the half.  Because I can feel the texture and smell it.  You didn't even.  I told you it wasn't going to work.  Put it in your mouth and hold it.  All you had was bread at that.  What's wrong with you?  Pretend the Little League coach is saying this to you.  Come on.  Now hold it.  Go.  Chew.  Chew it.  Chew it.  Chew it.  Don't spit it out.  Oh, God damn you.  What's wrong with him?  Hunter, give him a little of the water to wash it down with.  It didn't work.  Yeah. 
[03:11:00]  Whack.  Right in the face.  Take some water.  Sorry, guys.  Squirt some water.  Oh, Hunter.  That was the.  You gave him the vodka.  Oh, Hunter.  That's a shame.  Are you drunk, Sam?  Yeah.  That was it.  Isn't that amazing?  He just doesn't like steak.  Man, are you terrible.  Sam, you're an idiot.  It's a fury.  I hope that booze makes you do something that's career costing. 
[03:11:30]  Well, it is.  Ask for a raise day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sam takes off his clothes and just marches down the hall.  It demands his rights.  Demands his rights as a woman.  It talks about what needs to be stocked in the vending machine.  We need more plain food.  White bread.  I don't understand.  How do you not enjoy things like that?  It's just not the way God made me.  Oh, don't blame it on him.  Yeah.  Or her. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, yeah.  Are you guys still hungry?  What do you got left?  All this talking about him not eating has made me hungry.  I'm packed.  Yeah.  You guys are full already?  I'm a pretty fucking full guy.  Come on.  I know.  I'll try something else.  Why not?  Okay.  We got five minutes.  We got to wrap up in five?  We have a mashup person here.  I know.  It's Ryan.  What's up, Ryan?  Just in a bag.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He needs that chicken in a bag.  You need to put him in a bag. 
[03:12:30]  God, what a waste.  Yeah.  Put him in a couple bags.  How do you just not enjoy that?  It's frustrating, right?  I know.  It's not even like it's something marginal or an acquired taste or something.  Or butter.  It's everyone loves it.  It's wonderful.  Sure.  Sam.  It's what makes me special.  Yeah.  What are you, a special K or something?  All right.  Hey.  All right, Chip.  Hey, when are we getting you guys out to Cali?  Oh, man.  Anytime you want.  Fly us out.  Yeah.  Fly us out on your dime.  We'll be there tomorrow.  I'll be there next week. 
[03:13:00]  Watch out what you wish for, boys.  Okay?  I said I would be back and cook.  That's true.  You guys want to play this game about fly us out on your dime?  That's true.  And then we got to show him.  Tell Josh from Golden West Meats to get his plane out here.  That's how we normally do it.  How about that?  Oh, yeah?  I dare you to get me a hook.  I have a feeling there's a plane ride in our future.  I bet you can't put that much money in my pocket.  Just come on and try that.  We'll have to figure something out.  How far are you from L.A.? 
[03:13:30]  How long is your place far?  Because I'll be out there next week.  L.A. is about an hour flight up north.  I live up by San Fran, up in the wine country.  But I guarantee, listen, man, where I live, I mean, I love to go around the country.  We see all these great places.  But this place that I live, once this all kind of changed in my world, people said,  are you going to move?  Are you going to go to New York and live in L.A.?  Make it a lot easier.  I wouldn't have to drive and fly as much.  But it's a great place to raise my boys.  I have Hunter and Ryder.  No library.  And I tell you, it's an awesome place.  You come up and check.  Matter of fact, come up, bring bail money, and I guarantee you, fantastic. 
[03:14:00]  Wine country.  Have you ever been to San Quentin?  We took a tour of San Quentin.  Isn't that the bomb?  It's really good.  Alcatraz is actually my favorite.  I've gone there, too.  Yeah.  I went when I was a kid a bunch of times.  I remember they would give you the tour back then and put you in solitary confinement.  I would have been a horrible, horrible.  Wouldn't have worked out very well.  No.  One time.  I was in there for a minute.  I lost my mind.  Get me out of here.  Man, this is so good.  All right.  So this should put the final stick in you.  The final stick in you. 
[03:14:30]  This is it.  You guys are going to food coming.  We have gym memberships that are being passed out after this.  Sam is ridiculous, man.  I can't get over the fact that he doesn't like that.  Let's ask Roland.  Roland, what do you think of Sam?  Sickening.  Sickening.  Roland, did you get enough to eat?  He intercepted Hunter on the way to the big table.  Yes.  The steak is so delicious.  It's just nothing in your mouth.  Yo.  All right.  I'll try a little more.  Give us two.  I still got sausage to pick off of.  Yeah.  Give Mars mine. 
[03:15:00]  Did I give you guys knives last time I was here?  No.  Or did I just give you books?  I'll take a knife.  Oh, good.  Okay.  These are my knives.  This is from a company called Ergo Chef.  And they designed these knives.  This is probably one of the best knives you ever have.  This is called the Dragon Dagger.  Oh, man.  And I guarantee within the first week, you'll cut the crap out of your hand.  This one is sharp as a...  Don't give one to Mars.  He's Puerto Rican.  Oh, Anthony.  Oh, you've got one?  Fantastic.  It comes with a sheath, then.  You can wear it on your belt.  Walk through New York with this on you. 
[03:15:30]  But actually, I gave these to Carl, my chef.  But I know he won't mind partying with him.  There'll be more shipped to him.  But you've got to check these knives out.  These things are...  And what happens is when you hold...  It's like...  I don't play tennis or golf well, but...  I do.  If you think about when you get your clubs fit and get them set for you, everybody has...  You know, it's an extension of you.  So if you play guitar, you play golf, whatever.  So as a chef, having a knife that really sits in your hand correctly, so when you're cutting  and everything, you have that extension. 
[03:16:00]  And these knives are all designed in that style.  And then I put my funcitation on them.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You do realize you almost cut your wrist, right?  Yeah, no.  When you're doing the guitar thing with the knife in the one hand, you almost cut your wrist.  Yeah, exactly.  I didn't know what the hell you thought about.  It worked for me.  Why is there double, like a double point on the tip?  That's a poke shit.  It's like a fork.  Stay off the board.  You could pick stuff up with it.  No, you could...  It's like this.  Oh, okay.  You could put that on a deli platter or something like that.  I wouldn't leave this around many people, but this is...  I mean, this is the real deal.  That's a great knife.  Mars wants to know how easy you could take off wheel covers with it. 
[03:16:30]  See, the stereotype just doesn't end, doesn't end.  You could cut and shank the wire and dig inside and pull out the tack.  Yeah, you could hotwire the car with it.  It's your all-in-one theft tool.  And you don't get one, you get two if you call now.  Nice.  Just pay separate shipping.  Yeah, shipping and handling.  That has become the new scam.  How can it cost that much to handle it?  Put in box, mail.  I saw an ad for those...  You see the needle now that you don't have to thread through the little eye? 
[03:17:00]  It threads through the side of the needle.  And you get four of them and they go, but wait, order now and get an additional four.  Just pay separate shipping.  They're needles.  They're like sewing needles.  Put them in the same box.  I'm not looking for huge laughs.  And I didn't get it.  I'm just saying, I've seen this ad and it's real.  Why, it was a good one.  No, it's fine.  You're right.  We've got to wrap up with Guy because he's got to get Hunter to the game, right? 
[03:17:30]  They're telling me you've got to wrap up.  We'll stay here all day and eat.  Do not kick me out of the nest.  All right.  Okay, we're in the trust tree right now, aren't we?  Yes, we are.  I'm going to spoil the game for you.  The Mets lose.  Yeah, they're not going to win.  All right, Chip.  Hunter, shout out.  I'm wearing a giant shirt.  Very nice.  Hey, there you go.  Yeah, that's true.  Pass it out until someone passes out.  Just make sure that people keep eating.  But thank you guys.  I'll tell you something.  The show is outstanding.  You guys are funny as cats.  And literally when I left and I did some other visits around town doing some other shows 
[03:18:00]  and people, I mean everywhere, people on other stations came up and said, hey, by the  way, didn't I hear you today with the guys?  I mean, you guys got huge props and your audience loves you.  I see why.  That's great.  Except for the guy that doesn't eat the meat.  That's the only part.  For the mutual admiration bullshit, you actually got a great response from our listeners.  Loved having you on.  Well, you know, if you guys think about it, and I want to be the resident culinary cat,  so you guys think about when you have something going on, if you've got a bunch of listeners 
[03:18:30]  coming in or you've got a celebration or whatever the hell's going on, call me.  Let me know what you need.  I mean, we can do big rotisserie of pig.  Think about that.  Big rotisserie of pig.  Thank you that we work with it.  I don't have 48, huh?  Yeah.  Who's going to run the board from the other room?  Yeah.  See, that's an Iraq fat.  Yeah.  Who's going to run the board?  The headphones don't work, right?  Have you had it?  The headphones?  No, the headphones are kind of in and out. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, mine are kind of working.  I'm fine.  What's the big plugs?  You've got the sauces.  You've got the book.  You've got the knives.  I know you don't want to plug anything, but you might as well.  We should.  Now, the book, you guys, thank you for your help on that.  That went New York Times bestseller for, I don't know, 16 weeks.  Wow.  So that was a big deal.  It was dedicated to my little sister that passed away in February, my sister Morgan,  which is their tattoo that's in the front of the book.  But you know what it is about these meats?  I'm being a chef and being a dad and being a dude that's shot.  I mean, I'm a big Costco fan. 
[03:19:30]  I loved doing that gig.  And I thought, okay, if we can make meat that I can really be respectful about as being a chef  and make stuff that people can buy and then go home and grill and cook, then I'm down with it.  And that's the program that we put together with these sausages.  And the cool thing about the sausage is they're all cooked.  So when people start going, wow, is it done?  Is it done?  They cut into it and all the flavor leaks out all over the grill.  So we make about four different sausages.  We make the Cajun sausage.  We make the egg roll sausage.  An apricot sesame is one I showed you.  We make one called the wine country, which has got cheese and wine in it inside the sausage. 
[03:20:00]  The Bloody Mary flank steak, big, big hit.  I cooked that last night for my crew wrapping up the new show that will be on Food Network,  Rachel versus Guy, that will be out in January.  Who wins?  Somebody.  But that's the great part about it.  You don't even know.  And we had great stars on there.  We had Joey Fatone, Coolio, Lou Diamond Phillips, Taylor Dane.  We had Summer Sanders, the Olympian.  We had Alyssa Miss USA.  We had Cheech Marin.  Oh, dude, talk about a cat that can cook.  So we had this whole mix of players that came in. 
[03:20:30]  What do you make?  Pot brownies?  You don't think I used that joke 9,000 times?  It'll never air, you know, because I said it each time.  And now the dessert competition.  Cheech, what are you going to make?  And the producers in my ear are going, enough already.  I mean, you've run the joke.  And Cheech is like, I haven't smoked weed in 40 years.  But he is a funny dude, man.  Yeah.  And then we got these salsas.  We did the salsas.  The barbecue sauce, actually, is another one.  We do four different barbecue sauces.  And the one here, these barbecue sauces, they're in the top 25 in the country, 
[03:21:00]  which is a big deal because we've only been out with them for about four months.  So you got brown sugar and bourbon.  Yeah, we got the whole giddy up, man.  You got a real corporation going here.  This is great.  It's been a good thing.  It's taken me a few years because I wasn't into doing it.  So we found the right.  Is he putting it in his backpack?  Yeah, he thinks you can drink it.  So I'm taking that smoky one.  That's it.  Well, this was cool.  And Hunter is going to high school. 
[03:21:30]  So this was a big deal to bring him and come meet you guys.  High school.  Oh, yeah.  He's on his way.  Enjoy the rejection.  It only gets better after that, though, believe me, if you're in radio.  Other than that, you'll be a tin knocker and it'll stink.  Oh, wait, that's me.  Sorry about the salty language that some of the people on the show used.  Well, you know what?  He's got to get used to high school, and he's going to hear a lot more in high school.  I think parents like to think that isn't going to happen, but it's high school. 
[03:22:00]  Remember when you went to high school.  I mean, it was a couple days a year.  Yeah, look who his dad is.  Look who his father is.  He's heard it all.  What you should be saying to us is remember when you dropped out of high school.  All right, well, he has to go, and I guess we're wrapping up.  All right, well, Guy, thanks, man.  Thank you, Guy.  Anytime you guys.  Thank you, man.  You need me, you call.  A big hand, yeah.  Fantastic.  We'll see you guys tomorrow, I guess.  That's it?  Oh, yeah, but, um.  No.  Bye-bye.  Oh, my God. 
[03:22:30]  This is the worst of the OPN3 show on the virus.  Sirius XM.  Oh, here we go.  This is enough to keep us.  Yes.  It's burning, it's rising, it's rising, it's rising, it's rising, it's rising, terrible.  Oh, my, get out of the way, please.  It's burning, it's rising in a flame, and it's falling on the morning fast, and all the  folks between the better than terrible, this is one of the worst catastrophes in the world.  Oh, it's like 20, oh, it's 4500 feet into the sky, and it's a terrific crash, ladies 
[03:23:00]  gentlemen, it's smoke in its place now, and it's rising to the ground, not quite to the  morning fast, oh, the humanity at all the fast, oh, the poor Nazis, oh, damn.  It's, it's, oh, I can't talk, ladies and gentlemen.  Honest in fifth leg, they're a massive smoking wreckage.  What a great journalist. 
[03:23:30]  Just falls apart when something happens.  I'm sorry.  Oh, get out of the way.  Oh, this is horrible.  But that's the thing, though.  They weren't desensitized back then.  They didn't see anything.  You're right.  They never saw a fucking capping thrown into a ceiling fan.  You know what I mean?  He's right.  This guy never saw a punched up fucking tub girl.  Two girls, one cup.  Yeah, he never got tricked.  Oh, no, they tricked me with meat spin.  Oh, get out of the way. 
[03:24:00]  Oh, look at the count.  I'm up to 10,000.  Oh, the humanity.  There's tub girl.  A classic.  Oh, my God.  I've never seen that.  Oh, no.  You've never seen tub girl?  There's diarrhea.  Bobby, come on.  He's just getting the nicotine out of his system.  Look at tub girl.  Did you just throw up?  Tub girl was fucking the lady hitting her head in the tub.  You've never seen tub girl?  You've never seen that?  I fucking have, but I didn't know you fucking named it.  Take a look.  It's tub girl. 
[03:24:30]  Did you just...  Take a look, quick.  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  You're that sensitive?  Yeah, he's the worst.  Has he thrown up before?  Oh, no.  Tub girl's shooting on her face.  Oh, it's the worst catastrophe I've ever seen.  Oh, get your face out of the way.  Has that happened before?  Oh, every time.  It never gets old.  I can't look at that.  I can't look at that.  Well, look at this.  This is a lot easier.  This is a lot easier to look at.  Yeah. 
[03:25:00]  Dude, this is a lot easier.  No.  Look at that.  It's a pro-lapse.  No, it's easy.  It was tripping.  No.  It's tripping.  Fucking awful.  It's a tripping pro-lapse.  Oh, no, no.  Bobby, it's easy.  This one's easy.  Bobby just did a spit take.  Why do you...  Oh, God.  Oh, this is great.  Why does this stuff get to you?  I love it.  Like you said, we've all seen everything now.  I love the fucking logic behind that.  Why does this stuff get to you?  You say that like you just showed me bunnies. 
[03:25:30]  But this stuff doesn't bother me.  I can't see it.  I can't see a beheading video or anything like that.  But this shit I could easily see with nothing.  I can't watch a beheading video, but it doesn't gross me out.  I can't watch it.  I grew up with this.  I can't.  It's the asshole.  No, I grew up with this shit.  My dad was a doctor, and he had all these books.  Oh, really?  He had journals and shit.  And when I was like five or six years old, I used to look at his old medical books.  He had a book of just diseases of the balls. 
[03:26:00]  And I would look at this, and it was just diseased cocks.  What's the worst disease of the balls?  Do you remember?  Any of them that look like that.  Anything when there's things dripping or there's warts or carbuncles.  But other kids were looking at Dr. Seuss.  Something like that?  I don't even know what that is.  Yeah, I don't know what that is.  I can't even figure out what's water in that picture.  That's just a mess of tissue, of drippy tissue.  Bobby, you always had it?  It's so funny that most kids grew up with finding a porno mag under their dad's bed.  He found diseases of the balls.  Yeah, that's pretty bad.  You know what?  I remember those balls.  Look at that. 
[03:26:30]  What is that?  That doesn't make you throw up?  I think I have that.  I remember some of the medical journals looking at him as a kid.  And if you're jerking off to a girl that's naked with the black strip over her eyes,  you just feel really filthy.  I remember that.  A book of diseases.  You had to pick a not very diseased girl, but it was something that she had to be naked  to see.  Some kind of curvature.  Some spine thing you could deal with. 
[03:27:00]  Oh my God.  You're jerking off to a chip with scoliosis.  You can handle that.  And black fucking band over her eyes so you don't know who she is.  Where were you guys getting those journals?  I remember from like school, I would go to the library and it was that and photography  books.  I would go to the library and then I would take a photography book, I'd put it inside  another book, and then I would slowly tear a naked girl picture out of it and then put  it in my pocket so I could beat off with it later.  At the library.  I had to go to the fucking library. 
[03:27:30]  You kids today got it easy.  That's right.  When we were kids, the search for porn was a long thing.  Some kid would show up or you'd find a piece of porn under an overpass, like three pages  of a magazine, and you'd go back under that overpass three weeks in a row looking for  the fucking magazine to show up.  You could go weeks without ever seeing porno.  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  You were constantly looking for it.  I remember just walking through a park and thinking you saw a tit on a piece of paper 
[03:28:00]  and you'd start dusting off like an archaeologist.  You know what I mean?  Like you just found a dinosaur in the home.  The sacred scrolls.  But there was some kid who showed up.  Do you remember the kid who had the older brother who showed up?  The first cum shot I ever saw, some kid was like, we didn't even know what it was.  You were like, what is that goop?  You know, we were like 12 years old and then you had to figure out how to do it.  What is that goop?  And then you wiped it off your cheek.  Oh.  I'm joking.  What about this one?  I had a friend, John McCullough.  His father had a subscription to Playboy. 
[03:28:30]  Was that gold or not?  Oh damn.  Yeah.  I was friends with a kid just because we would go over to his house and check out fucking  Playboy's.  I just love when people give the whole name.  John McCullough.  Any story with the whole name on it.  I haven't thought of John McCullough in the house.  The only reason I was friends with him was because his father had a fucking subscription  to Playboy.  But do you remember though the first time you saw how people fucked?  Like, I mean, Playboy was like, you know, Playboy, but when you saw like how it actually  worked, you're like, holy shit, your balls just caught fire and you're like, this is  the best thing I've ever seen in my life.  I saw it in a comic book. 
[03:29:00]  I was involved in books in a mall, the history of underground comics, and they had a section  on sex.  It was like an R-Crumb, you know, cartoon of people fucking.  I'm like, that's how it goes in?  That's what that looks like?  And then I found that picture book, like, uh, not that I saw the joy of sex.  That fucked me up.  The joy of sex.  The best.  Wasn't it illustrations?  Yeah, they were all illustrations.  Yeah, they were all illustrations.  It was such a gift to know how things fit together.  Yeah.  I had the encyclopedia.  I had to get creative.  Encyclopedia works too.  I had to get creative with the encyclopedia. 
[03:29:30]  You'd really have to look through it and figure out, like, what subject would maybe have a  naked chick.  Well, let's look at naked sick girls and see which one you would jerk off to.  Tahiti was a good one.  The virus.  Serious sex out.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the O.P. and Anthony show continues.  Continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  It's After O.P. and Anthony Live, never mind the worst of.  We're just busy cleaning up the fishbowl. 
[03:30:00]  Everybody's trying to figure out what's what.  The couch of zilches are coming in here.  Everybody just sit down on the couches or chairs.  Make yourselves at home.  Welcome to the show, everyone.  Troy, he's on the couch.  He's been mouthing off the whole time.  This guy is like Mr. Jokes. 
[03:30:30]  Mr. Jokes over here.  Has he said anything to you?  No, no.  These guys are great.  I'll accept that guy.  That guy who just sat down in the chair in front of the mic.  Why are you busting his balls?  Well, you know how he just sat down in the chair in front of a mic thinking, oh, this  will be cute?  Yeah.  That's what he's been doing all day.  Just trying to be cute?  Yeah, the whole time.  He's making jokes the whole time I'm on the mic.  He wants to get noticed, though.  Like it's his show.  Right.  And he's just been making...  He's a big fan.  He feels like he's a part of it.  But Marcos is over there.  Like, I don't know who he is.  He's the biggest fan.  He's a big fan.  He calls in every day. 
[03:31:00]  Every day.  And he calls in...  He is an example of a good caller.  Yeah.  Because I know his voice and every...  I'm like, ONA, what's your name?  Where are you calling from?  Marcos from Yonkers.  Speaks clear.  And he clearly says what he has to say.  And he does it concisely.  Bravo, Marcos.  And he calls in a special delivery.  He's not...  He's a virus fan.  Right.  I mean...  Right.  And he's not sitting there, like, making cute comments the whole time and trying to  sit in front of a mic.  It's a big opportunity for the guy, you know.  He's excited to be here.  It's...  You know, you probably listen every day, right? 
[03:31:30]  Hey, let him come up here.  Get on mic here.  All right.  I'll give him one shot.  Yeah.  So you're just...  You're a big fan, right?  I'm a huge fan.  And you're just...  I've been listening to ONA longer than Sam's been working here.  Yeah.  And Sam's trying to bust your balls like an asshole, right?  I know.  That's exactly it.  He's just mad because, you know, he didn't...  I don't know.  I guess today's the big day.  That was it.  How's that going to work?  He blew his shot.  Back on the couch.  Oh, sorry, dude.  You see what I mean, Troy?  You got Joey Cox over here.  Joey Cox.  We all know Joey Cox.  Old intern.  He's our old intern, and he's sitting there just being chill. 
[03:32:00]  He's not like, hey, guys, remember I was an intern?  Yeah, I know.  Over here.  He was the last flock of interns, if I remember correctly.  I stayed to the end after everybody else left until I was the last intern.  Period.  You're the last man standing there.  Here it is.  Here he is.  I sat in that office until everybody else left.  Yeah.  You know?  We got a girl.  Yes.  You don't see girls too often, and she's not like, hey, look at me, look at me.  And what's your name?  My name is Geraldine.  Geraldine.  Isn't it weird?  Ever since we started the couch of zilches, it's like there's actually good-looking women 
[03:32:30]  who listen to the show.  Yeah, but she's with it.  You guys are together, right?  See, that's the way it is, though.  That's the way it always is.  I wasn't trying to court her.  Well, no, no, I'm just saying, for me, being a single guy, you know, the girls are always  with the dudes.  That's just the way it works.  If I didn't get in, she was going to be here anyway.  Oh, okay.  She was going to be standing outside.  She was going to be here.  That wouldn't have made it.  I think Travis makes the selections, and this is usually, he takes women that are with  someone, but Travis almost never invites the guy.  Like, every time there's been a girl who's like, yeah, I have a boyfriend, he's at 
[03:33:00]  home listening.  He actually said, did I actually put you both on there?  Oh, yeah, I did.  That's what he said when he checked the list.  He didn't think he put me on there.  No, no.  He thought it was just her.  I was going to leave him anyway.  I wasn't going to leave him.  You were here regardless, right?  Yeah, regardless.  Travis wasn't going to.  Oh, and Roland's walking up the hallway with hands up in the air like victory.  Usually, Travis, you don't take the girl, but not the guy she's with.  I'm going to get a sandwich.  I'll be back.  Yeah, get a sandwich for yourself, Troy.  No, usually it's just one person emailing because I'm very clear that only you can come. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah.  They emailed us as a couple.  We doubled the couch today because we were in the fishbowl.  Okay.  So I said, you know what?  Special exception.  I'll let them both come.  Thank you.  You're a beautiful person.  It was magical.  I think so.  Was it romantic for you two?  It was very.  Very much.  Is that the E-Rock alarm?  Did you just get here, Eric?  What's going off in there?  Yes, I did.  What was that?  No, that was the alarm on my phone.  What was it for?  It was timing out the worst of them.  Lunchtime?  All right. 
[03:34:00]  It was easy, Eric.  That was an easy one.  I didn't want to do the fishbowl.  You didn't want to do the fishbowl.  I didn't want to leave it.  Oh, it was paradise for you, Roland.  It was awesome.  It was a stressful day for you.  Yeah.  But you were rewarded handsomely at the end, weren't you?  Bet you sweet tits I did.  What did you say, Troy?  Reaping the reward.  He's just reaping.  Three drinks.  And I looked at the management and said, guess what I'm going to do in an hour?  Taking a fucking nap.  Now, but you're a heavy drinker.  Were those drinks strong enough to have any effect on you? 
[03:34:30]  It packed a punch.  It did.  The first one, yeah.  A little buzzing a little.  Yeah, why not?  Why not?  It's worked.  Good show.  You know?  Yeah, you had a good show.  Celebrate a little bit.  Yeah.  Two big A-listers.  Michael Ian Black.  Michael Ian Black.  Another great comic.  Yeah.  A-list chef.  A-list chef.  I mean, it was a huge show.  And it was a special show for you Couch of Zilches to be a part of.  So, what's your name?  I'm Joe.  Joe?  From West Irons, New Jersey.  Oh, okay.  And what about you? 
[03:35:00]  Greg from Long Island.  Greg from Long Island.  Sir, you come back to the mic.  Come back to the mic.  Because I didn't even get your name.  You can grab that one if you want, Roland.  What's your name?  My name is Tim.  Tim, I don't mean to pick on you.  I'm sorry, man.  I was just having fun with you.  No, you're allowed to have fun.  It's a pleasant day.  It is.  Maybe I was being too sensitive.  It is.  And you know what?  Am I in my hurry to get to hang out with you on the amazing Sam show?  Okay.  I like what you're doing now.  I even left my shirt in the fish bowl. 
[03:35:30]  Do you need it?  You know what?  I'd rather be here.  This is where it's at.  You see that?  That's great.  I can backpedal.  That's great.  You're good at it.  Done with you right now?  What?  I'm getting myself another fucking sandwich.  Are you?  Hell yes.  Is there any drinks left for yourself?  You bet your sweet tits.  We're going to do some shots soon.  Are we?  Guys, I want to do shots or let's do three?  How come Guy was getting on my case so bad about not eating steak?  Because it's the most delicious thing ever.  Yeah, but why can't people just accept whatever you want?  You can sit wherever you want. 
[03:36:00]  Why can't people just accept, like Marcos, come here.  You relate to me.  You know, we're both from Westchester.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm in Scarsdale.  You're in Yonkers.  There's a bit of a difference there.  Pretty close, though.  But yeah, very close to each other.  Why can't people just let me just do what I want?  Like, I'm not pushing anything on anyone.  Why does everybody insist that I do these things?  Well, I think that everyone should at least try things at least once in their life.  That's why probably people get mad at you. 
[03:36:30]  But I tried it.  Right?  It was in my mouth.  What's trying?  I shouldn't.  That's going to be isolated.  Yeah, I was going to say it was in my mouth.  Yeah, that part.  It's not good.  But no, there's just people like my mother.  She doesn't eat no steak at all.  Right.  Because she has problems digesting it.  So if I made up a medical problem, people would get off my case a little bit.  Yeah, probably.  Dude, the shit I'm going to take today, epic.  Is it?  That should be awesome.  I do have to say, though, it's nothing like a steak medium rare, bro.  It's very delicious.  With the horseradish sauce he made? 
[03:37:00]  Dude, I just got boner.  It's the boner.  Roland, you're excited.  Yeah.  Now, you said that you were dieting.  Yeah, for two days.  Was it worth it?  Fuck yeah.  Or is it still worth it because you're not done eating?  I'm not done eating.  Well, aren't you worried?  Because I saw the mashup.  The morning mashup was kind of cowering around.  Cowering is not the right word.  But gathering around the studio waiting for us to leave so they could get the scraps.  Are you worried that Stan and Ryan are going to take all your food? 
[03:37:30]  I would, but since I booked Guy, we had a little discussion before the end of the show.  I got a little nice piece of steak waiting for me.  You got a stash?  Oh, yes.  Fuck yeah.  Roland has a stash with you.  You had to see him.  I was watching him.  Every time something would come out, he'd be like, whoop, and he'd leave the room.  That's right.  Come right back in.  I booked it.  So you have hidden food?  I have a, yes.  Can I have some?  I have food.  It's just like a steak.  Can Eric have a little?  He wanted to know.  Oh, Troy with another sandwich.  Troy.  Another sandwich. 
[03:38:00]  This is my first one.  I haven't yet to eat anything.  Get out of here.  I want to get one.  I haven't had one.  The entire time you were eating.  And by the way, Troy, we just found out.  And that's fine.  But don't try to steal my sandwich.  We just found out?  Yeah.  Not only, thanks to Marco's.  Yeah.  This is what you say.  Marco's a great guest.  Great caller.  He's a great human being.  Not only was Roland eating the whole time.  Yeah.  And I have video evidence of that.  Yeah.  He was taking plates and hiding them.  He's got a hidden stash of steak.  What?  Yeah.  Well, I talked to Mr. Guy since I booked him. 
[03:38:30]  He said, here, here's this for you.  I mean, that's the benefits, right?  That's part of the job.  Yeah.  Hey.  Listen, this is his day.  Let Roland just bask in the glory.  What's amazing is, like, Roland works very hard at his job.  Very hard.  We talked about it a couple days ago, I think, that he puts his career before everything.  He's very good.  So I don't want this to be taken the wrong way.  But in terms of how much time and energy and everything was put into a guest, I have never seen Roland work like he worked for this Guy Fieri. 
[03:39:00]  I mean, I would think that the, you know, what's it, Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds' appearance would be a bigger deal.  But I've never seen Roland work as hard as he worked today.  He was in this building at 4.30 this morning.  I was here till, like, 7.30 last night to lock up everything for Guy.  Why?  The fire thing.  You're never here like that.  It has to get done, so.  I had to get the knife permit pass from the building and this pass and that pass. 
[03:39:30]  And there was no way that you were going to let this go off.  Fuck no.  Anything but perfectly.  Yep.  Roland does a great job.  And shit like this goes off.  I mean, there's a lot of behind-the-scenes shit.  Yeah.  A lot of running around.  And Roland handled his shit, man.  He's got his running shoes on.  Yeah.  Look at him sweating.  Yeah, because Ryan Jason...  Well, that's from all the chewing.  He's just chewing so much.  It's actually...  Ryan Forgad's glasses ran to the Today Show.  They thanked me again, so...  Why don't you keep them?  Just be like, I don't know where they are. 
[03:40:00]  And then we could...  One of us could own Ryan Reynolds' sunglasses.  Because he was super nice.  Oh.  They were.  They were good guests.  They were very nice, yeah.  They were good guests.  What did Roland get?  What are you taking home with you?  I'm taking, I guess, steaks.  Premium steaks.  How many?  Brisket's, packs, sauces.  You just blazed right over that question.  Wait a minute.  Is there any parting gifts for our couch of zilches?  The word fuck I know.  He had some barbecue sauces over there.  Did I get those?  I have more sauces for myself. 
[03:40:30]  Did he send me sauces?  More sauces.  You're taking the knives?  No.  They're giving me a nice gift pack for booking them.  It's part of the best.  Hey, honestly, he deserves it.  I feel he deserves it.  His gig.  I mean, I can't hate on you for it.  He was victorious in this comedy.  He baths.  And this is my...  You were victorious in the booking of a chef.  And Roland's always awesome.  Because if we want a celebrity picture around here, we ask Roland.  And Roland will make it happen.  And he does.  And he makes sure shit gets done. 
[03:41:00]  Look, again, I'm not criticizing Roland.  And all I'm doing is pointing out that it's a funny, very funny set of incidents that he's never been as diligent in his job as he was today because Guy Fieri was coming in and cooking steaks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have to fight facilities.  I'm like, shut up.  Are you a foodie or...  A foodie.  You are a foodie.  Eric.  Yeah.  You're more just indulgent.  You're not like a foodie.  I enjoy...  I'm not a foodie, but I enjoy. 
[03:41:30]  Right.  You're just indulgent.  You like to indulge.  It's not a criticism.  I'm just saying...  Yeah.  Right.  Okay.  Okay.  I thought you were asking like you didn't know this.  No, no, no.  I'm just differentiating it.  Because, Eric, when I ask questions, it's not just for my knowledge.  It's for all the zilches and for all the people listening at home, too.  Oh, that is true.  You know what I mean?  I'm hosting a show here.  Yeah, but Guy's Cookbook is awesome, though.  Is it?  Have you tried some of the recipes?  Oh, yeah.  It's phenomenal.  Yeah?  Eric, I'll ask Roland in a second because he's a foodie. 
[03:42:00]  But you're not a foodie.  You're just an indulgent guy who likes to eat.  Are my eating habits something that keeps you up at night that it apparently does to other people?  No, because that means there's more for us.  Yeah.  You don't care.  You just say, oh, I'll just take what's on his plate.  You want to sit there and starve while there's, you know, a five-star chef is cooking you this fantastic food,  and you just want to sit there and go, I can't eat any of that.  Your eating habits infuriate me.  Why?  It's so childish. 
[03:42:30]  Marcos, grab that mic.  Yeah, Marcos is going to ask a quick question.  Okay, I would like to know, Sam, what if you were...  Hang on.  Hey, Marcos and Yonkers, you're on the show.  Hey, what's going on, Prime Time?  What if you were stranded in an island?  No chickens around, bro.  What would you do?  No chickens, right?  Yeah.  Like, what would you eat?  Where did all the chickens go?  No, think about it.  Like, let's say you only had a choice of a pig or, let's say, a cow, whatever.  What would you do?  What about some coconuts? 
[03:43:00]  We're on an island.  Dude, have you seen Castaway?  You see how it does to you, right?  It runs right through you?  Yeah.  There's no modium AD out there.  It has to be meat.  I think in a situation like that, obviously, you just do what you have to do because...  To fight for your life.  Yeah, the will to survive kicks in.  Yeah, my psychological stuff probably wouldn't kick in.  It's just going out with your beautiful fiancée to a nice restaurant with her family, and  you know, where they're spending a lot of money to take you out to a nice dinner, and  this asshole has to order chicken fingers. 
[03:43:30]  Like, that to me just looks like...  Like, I would be...  If I was Jess, and I don't want to speak for Jess, but I would be embarrassed.  This is a common misconception.  He just faced you.  Listen, I'm about to respond, Roland.  You didn't book Troy.  You can't...  It's a common misconception.  If there's a free-range roasted half chicken on the menu, that's just as good.  What about chicken cacciatore?  What's on chicken cacciatore? 
[03:44:00]  A chicken that you catch or something?  That's very good, Marco.  Is that chicken, ham inside in the middle?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  No, that's chicken cordon bleu.  Yeah, I'm not gonna...  Nothing stuffed.  I mean, stuff has to be laid out for me.  This is what you're getting.  There's nothing inside that you don't know about.  What about chicken nuggets stuffed with cheese?  Those are good.  I might try chicken nuggets stuffed with cheese.  I mean...  That does sound kind of good.  Who's not gonna try that?  You know what I mean?  That's a good call.  But why...  I mean...  Alright, Jess has a small problem with it, but...  Well, of course. 
[03:44:30]  It's embarrassing.  It's so childish.  But it's not...  Why?  Because I ordered the chicken dish?  Yeah, he's gonna have chicken fingers for his fucking wedding.  Everybody has chicken at their wedding.  Chicken fingers?  I didn't say...  That's what he said.  It's a common misconception.  I eat chicken.  Don't you want to expand your palate?  You're not acknowledging your misconception.  Don't you have the desire to try new things?  Like, why did your palate shut off at, like, three?  Your palate has Down syndromes.  First of all, there's no plural in Down syndromes.  It is.  Anyway. 
[03:45:00]  I'm sorry, Mr. Grammar.  Mr. Grammar.  No.  I gotta go get a sandwich.  Go get yourself a sandwich.  You're welcome to come back, Roland.  It's not that I'm stuck on chicken fingers.  I'll eat any type of chicken.  I don't like it drenched in a sauce.  You know, but if it's a light sauce, I might be able to work around it.  But don't you feel bad for your beautiful fiancé that she has to go out and be embarrassed by that?  Never once.  Never once have I felt bad for her.  Because most restaurants have a chicken dish on the menu.  And probably when she met you, she knew what she was getting herself into with this bullshit. 
[03:45:30]  Do you think I just started doing this?  Right.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  But if a restaurant has a chicken dish, and that's what I choose to order, how does it affect it?  It's just silly.  It really is.  Like, why would you not want to experience other things?  You've got a DeLorean logo tattooed to the back of your neck.  I had a DeLorean.  Who cares?  And you're talking about what's silly.  Yeah.  Yeah, I do.  And that's stupid.  Because eventually in life, I can try steak, and you'll still have a DeLorean logo on the back of your neck.  I can get it covered up if I won. 
[03:46:00]  With what?  It's the back of your neck.  Something else.  That's a stupid analogy.  You're being stupid.  Well, you're missing out on a lot of good food.  But I'm not missing out because I have no desire for it.  Oh.  Well, I do have to say that me personally, I haven't ate bread in about eight months because I've been doing Atkins.  And I ate the bread today because I was going to say, hey, this guy cooked it.  When am I ever going to get to it?  Yeah, Marcus didn't want to be rude.  But you know what happens.  With Atkins, every one of those carbohydrates, you're just going to blow up in your system.  You might as well never have started. 
[03:46:30]  I've been doing carbs for like three days now.  Jess just texted me.  What does she have to say?  Thank you, Troy.  It does suck.  That's what she said, but she's joking.  She's doing it for the show, I'm sure.  I'm trying, Jess.  I'm trying.  You're in there, right?  Yeah.  What is it about Troy that he has to have a problem with everyone's lifestyle?  Eric goes home and watches cartoons and drinks Coke floats and plays video games.  I don't drink Coke floats.  Well, that's neither here nor there.  Watches Ghostbusters.  And he watches Ghostbusters.  Everybody comments on my lifestyle. 
[03:47:00]  Who?  Why can't everybody?  I knew he was going to bust my balls because I go skateboarding.  No, no, no, no.  We bust your balls in response.  You come in here with major problems about everyone's lifestyle.  I don't go in and go, why the fuck is Troy skateboarding?  Well, it'll come up on air that something's going on about eating and I will comment on it.  Yeah, but no, no, no.  You have said.  And I'm commenting on it because this was a part of the show today.  That's why I'm commenting on it.  You have said.  I wouldn't just come in and be like, oh, your fucking diet sucks.  You've said Eric's lifestyle disgusts you.  It is disgusting.  He turns his head sideways like Stewie Griffin and goes, he's just so unhealthy. 
[03:47:30]  That is what you sound like.  I don't get it.  That is what you sound like.  Because he's a fat fucking mess.  And well, that's again, I can't.  I mean, look at this.  That's not an argument that I'm willing to get into.  Somebody needs to put together an Eric Nagel timeline of how he has blown up to this point.  You want to see a photo?  Hold on.  No, I want to see a timeline.  I want to see a timeline of where you're at.  And he'll do stuff like it.  Because I sit with him in the control room.  He'll move and his belly will poke out of his shirt.  And I'm just like, while he's loading in little treats in his water bottles. 
[03:48:00]  Yeah.  He has to put his little treats.  Pouring powder in there.  He has powder.  But why do our lifestyles affect you?  Uh-oh.  Because it's just disgusting.  It's gross.  Troy likes staring at the guys on this show.  Because there's no women here.  There's no women.  No, the Opie comment is because...  Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on.  Hotline.  You're on the after show.  Troy.  Troy.  Troy.  Oh.  Troy.  Troy.  It's Opie.  Yes. 
[03:48:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  It's Opie.  It's Opie.  It's called Sartacaddy.  It's Tim Norton.  We're enjoying Troy calling out everyone on their shit.  Troy is a judgmental person.  You call me out on shit, motherfucker.  Who just puts other people's lifestyle in the lane of his judgment as if he is in a position  to judge anyone.  Yo, say whatever you want about me.  I don't give a shit.  Your hair looks dumb.  No one does.  Look who's fucking talking.  My hair looks good.  Yeah.  Hey, more importantly, is E-Rock still eating from the cup of meat? 
[03:49:00]  No.  I had my eat cup and my drink cup.  I actually just got a text message that I should read from Chip.  I don't know who gave Chip Chipperson my cell phone number, but he wrote, E-Rock ate  a bunch of rocks or something.  Which, I mean, Chip, it doesn't help the show for you to be texting me this whole time.  E-Rock was eating so many cups of meat that I had to go get more cups.  Fucking Chip.  He's in the car with you now, Opie? 
[03:49:30]  I gotta drive home with Chip.  And guess what?  He doesn't break character the entire time because he knows I hate it.  I've spent some time in San Diego with Chip.  I know.  Eric just showed me a picture of himself as a kid.  I would be embarrassed if I saw that picture.  Well, look, nobody's gonna say that Eric doesn't need to spend a little time in the gym, but  that doesn't mean you have to come in and judge the guy.  Well, he's the one that says, oh, I have to show you a picture of what I used to look  like.  You brought it up!  Yeah, you didn't have to come in here and show me a picture of you in high school.  Look who's out there right now looking in. 
[03:50:00]  You think she's disgusted, Troy?  I'm not gonna say who it is, but do you think that person is disgusted?  She's not happy.  Yeah.  She's not happy.  Let's just say it's somebody else who works here who knows Eric, and she's obviously  looked in here like, I can't believe I know that.  She's also...  Well, never mind.  Never mind.  Can I ask the food guys?  I mean, we all enjoy food, but I noticed something today with Roland and E-Rock.  They were pretty much having orgasms as they were eating.  Is that what happened with people that really enjoy their food? 
[03:50:30]  Food addicts.  Food addicts.  No, I'm asking an honest question, and Jimmy's sort of answering it from the back seat.  It looked like Roland and E-Rock were about to come.  They were so happy.  Well, Roland just went out to get another sandwich, so we can't...  But Eric, was it orgasmic pleasure?  Roland was out of his mind with pleasure for this food.  I appreciate good food.  I had a great time, but nowhere near the level that Roland was at.  And I got to tell you guys something.  For many years, I didn't really believe in the food addict thing. 
[03:51:00]  I think I finally believe it, because I saw Roland's eyes.  They just changed.  They changed it to his...  How do you explain it?  I mean, and that also goes to our point about Roland spending more time on this guest booking  than all of his guest bookings this week combined, and showing up here at 4.30 in the  morning to make sure that everything went off without a hitch.  Yeah, that was...  I don't know how it sounded on the radio, to be honest with you, but it was a lot of  fun to just sit there and watch them cook and eat that shit. 
[03:51:30]  Yeah, they all seemed to...  The food was very good, but Roland and E-Rock...  I'd say Roland more, but that's that...  They acted the way I would act if there was a girl in there jerking people off for money.  Eric...  Just running around, the mania, the excitement, I understand that.  Eric, is this something you worry about?  Do you think you may be a food addict?  I mean, you drink a lot of Coke floats.  I don't drink Coke floats.  Whatever.  I think Eric thinks he's in so deep now, like, why bother going in the other direction? 
[03:52:00]  I think Troy thinks he knows what's best for everybody and keeps flapping his mouth about  what everybody else should be doing.  Say whatever you've got to say about me, dude.  No, because no one cares what you do.  You care about everybody else.  Then why do you care about what I say about you, motherfucker?  Because you don't...  Stop.  Because it's on the show.  We just had a show about food, asshole.  Eric, someone's angry.  He didn't eat enough food.  I didn't.  I want to go get more food.  Troy's sensitive about his nipples.  I think...  Yeah, wait, wait, wait.  OBS.  You know, it's what me and Jimmy did here.  We heard these guys yelling and screaming, and we decided to start the pot today. 
[03:52:30]  We love hearing you guys just fight.  Well, thank you.  I mean, I love it.  And what's up with the Coke floats?  I'm jealous.  I want a Coke float.  Well, Eric loves Coke floats, and he refuses to admit it.  He's the one who got me started on the damn things.  It's a Florida thing.  I'm from Long Island.  West Palm Beach.  Yeah, West Palm.  Represent!  You know what Troy's problem is, why he's so angry?  No.  Troy drinks that fucking lawn-clipping vegan shit every day, right?  He does drink grass juice every day.  When you give an iguana or something like that, you have to feed it vegetables, because if 
[03:53:00]  you give it meat, it becomes very angry and evil, and it attacks you.  Troy had some meat today, and now he's just biting everyone's head off.  Yeah, but I'll bite motherfuckers' heads off when I just have my lawn-clipping drink.  I don't give a shit.  But we have a show.  The show, at the end of the show, is dedicated to food, eating.  And we're talking about you and your obsession with eating.  It's obvious.  Look at you.  It's fantastic.  Yeah, so that's what I'm commenting on.  If there was a show about skateboarding, and you wanted to comment on it... 
[03:53:30]  No, because no one has any interest in you and what you do.  Okay, well then don't comment on it.  They enjoy my food stories.  They enjoy Roland's food stories.  And people enjoy me talking about how fat and roly-poly you are.  No one does.  Well, actually...  Let's pull out Twitter and see what they say.  Well, no, speaking of that, I got another...  I don't even know if I should read it.  I got another text message from Chip, who wrote, uh, Roland was eating rolls and stuff.  I mean, I don't even know what that means.  Oh, boy.  I don't know why he texted me. 
[03:54:00]  I don't know why he's texting me.  Uh, who, Opie, Jim, who do you guys think is in the right here?  Eric is sitting here saying, don't worry about what I do.  Whereas Troy is saying, Eric, you're a disgusting pig.  Who do you think?  I think...  I think this, Sam.  How the fuck are you skating?  You didn't even eat steak today.  Yeah, exactly.  Thank you.  Well, I...  How are you able to turn it and get E-Rock and Troy?  How are you going to fight each other when you were the headline today that you get  this unbelievable chef, Guy Fieri, coming in and he's cooking steak for us and you're 
[03:54:30]  puking up his steak in front of him?  How is that not the headline today on the after show?  Because I'm a genius.  No, we brought it up.  It's embarrassing for Jess.  She admitted it, that he has this palate of a three-year-old.  It's not a three-year-old.  A three-year-old doesn't have an herb-roasted, half-free-range chicken, whatever.  I eat chicken dishes.  I went to steakhouses with Jim Norton two years in a row in San Diego.  He was never embarrassed by my behavior.  At least he was.  No, I was embarrassed by your appearance and your... 
[03:55:00]  Sam was fine to go out and eat with.  Like, he wasn't a fuss budget, as we say, and he didn't make it all about himself.  Sam doesn't bother other people with his eating habits.  For some reason, they're just enraging.  It just bothers everyone around him, but he seems happy with the fact that he doesn't  get to eat anything good.  And by the way, don't say three-year-old anymore, because Uncle Paul is getting great.  Well, speaking of Uncle Paul, I just got another text message from Chip, who knows Uncle Paul, 
[03:55:30]  who wrote...  I guess he wants me to read the whole thing.  Tis, you know, T-S-S.  Tis, Troy...  By the way, Chip is one of the worst spellers of all time.  Troy should get some Meyer tattoos or something.  Tis, read this.  I think he meant more.  He writes, should, S-H-O-O-D, get some more, M-I-R-E, or something. 
[03:56:00]  And of course, in all of these texts, something is spelled S-U-M-P.  I don't know how that made it for Chip's spell check.  I don't know either.  Tell Troy you should go get some tattoos or something.  I just did, Chip.  I just read the text message.  Who's the girl?  I hear a girl voice.  That's just cute.  What's your name again?  Geraldine.  Geraldine is here, Chip.  That's a stupid name.  It is. 
[03:56:30]  Why don't you treat a guest with a little bit of respect and decency?  How old are you, 75?  It's an old lady's name.  It is an old lady's name.  I say it all the time.  Geraldine is not 75.  She's young.  That was my mother's friend's name.  Well, your mother's friend.  Why did you know your mother's friend so well?  Because she'd always be over the house.  And she'd always take me in the bathroom and say, Chip, I'll let you look at this.  Chip.  Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
[03:57:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  Chip, what do you mean, look at this?  What was she looking at?  My cock.  Chip, I just had Kenny pull over.  I cannot ride with Chip.  You're going to walk.  I'll see you tomorrow.  Bye, Kenny.  Bye.  Yeah, he jumped out of the car or something.  Wait, so now we're stuck with Chip?  What do you mean stuck?  I should be on the radio all the time.  Why?  Because I'm funny.  I just do good jokes.  I improv.  You want to plug your YouTube show? 
[03:57:30]  Oh, Chip at TV.  Go to YouTube and look up TV show.  Wait.  Chip TV show.  Yeah, that's it.  When's the new instrument going to be on?  I'll probably, Chip, I'll probably edit up a video for you today.  But there's only so much that my editing can do for you.  Chip, who do you side with here?  Troy for being judgmental or E-Rock for being fat?  Troy judges so much that he should be wearing a judge's robe or something. 
[03:58:00]  That's great, Chip.  I mean...  I like to just take everything and make it funny.  Yeah, you don't like adding in anything insightful or adding in a comment.  You just figure you'll go for a nice one-liner.  I side with Troy because E-Rock's fat.  I hope he has a heart attack or something.  Oh, Jesus Christ, Chip.  E-Rock, I don't even know Chip.  You ever met him?  Not really.  Not formally, no.  Have you heard what he said?  Go ahead, Chip.  I hope he's driving his car and he has a heart attack and dies. 
[03:58:30]  Why?  Oh, Chip.  That's just...  I mean, Eric...  That's harsh.  Now, Troy, based on what you've said about E-Rock's physical appearance, his habits,  do you think a heart attack is like a stretch of the imagination?  It's inevitable.  You do?  I wouldn't be surprised if it happens before 40.  And how old are you, Eric?  If you don't mind me asking?  33.  33.  How old do you think he looks, Troy?  I mean, he's a hard 38, 39.  You think so?  Yeah. 
[03:59:00]  And you'd think within the next six, seven years...  If he is headed down the path he's headed down and doesn't change anything about his  lifestyle, he will have a heart attack by the time he's 40.  The show is terrible.  Why are we listening to this?  Tripp, you're still...  I've got to get inside this show.  I don't want to hear this no more.  Don't listen, Chip.  Why do you call?  And stop texting me.  Stop telling him what I'm saying.  I just got to get inside.  Chip, I can hear you.  Stop texting him.  I thought that was good today, though.  I thought I did really good on the show. 
[03:59:30]  You're still on the phone, stupid.  I hate you, Octo.  I hope his legs get cut off or something.  You know why Chip hates you so much?  He hates fat people.  Oh, okay.  Anybody still there?  Huh.  Hey, I just like the fact that Troy gets so annoyed at Eric for that stuff that Eric just  doesn't give a shit.  I love the dynamic between those two.  Yeah, yeah. 
[04:00:00]  Troy is just sitting here, like, screaming at Eric about his life, and Eric is just shrugging  his shoulders.  He's going to go home to his meal, and he's going to make fun of Troy for exercising.  Yeah, exactly.  And meanwhile, his poor wife has to put up with...  What's that?  They're running out of food.  I cut the line.  I go, I booked him.  Give me another sandwich, please.  Well, Jim is worried that you might be a food addict.  Oh, and you have no addictions.  Please.  We all have addictions.  Yeah, but at least I'm not addicted to every... 
[04:00:30]  Like, I'm not addicted.  That's your response, Jim.  That's what you're going to...  That sucked.  I hope I don't ruin your next picture.  Oh.  Yeah.  Well...  Yeah.  I'm too full to argue.  I'm just really tired.  And a little buzzed.  I'm buzzed.  I'm really full.  It's delicious.  I like the fact that you took advantage of getting drunk at work today.  That pleased me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Roland went back for like...  How many did you have?  Three?  Four?  Four drinks. 
[04:01:00]  He just kept going back with his cup, pushing in front of everybody.  Like, the guy was sending his son out to give people everything.  Like, to serve them.  But Roland had no interest in waiting.  No.  They didn't book them.  They're viewers.  Roland is two drinks away from just pulling his dick out and running down the hall.  Roland?  He's right.  Yeah.  I'll see you guys tomorrow.  Bye, Kenny.  All right.  Later, Jim.  Bye, Kenny.  All right.  There he goes.  Jim and Kenny.  There's like a long line.  They go... 
[04:01:30]  People go, you can't get in line.  I'm like, oh, really?  Really?  Who's on line?  A lot of the programmers are like, dude, you can't get in line.  I'm like, dude, fuck off.  And you just cut.  I just cut.  I go, this is a sandwich for me.  They made a sandwich.  And they're like, are you serious?  I'm like, bye-bye, fuckers.  Marcos, are you bummed out that you're done eating today?  No, I'm good.  You're good.  You had enough?  It was delicious, though.  You're going to get back on Atkins?  Yeah.  I started right after here.  I'm not going to eat no more.  I thought people stopped doing Atkins in like 2004.  Yeah, well, it works for me.  Atkins is a lazy man's diet.  You're like, I'm trying. 
[04:02:00]  Where are you, Atkins?  Is that true, Marcos?  No, no, no.  I just like meats, you know?  Yeah.  It doesn't sound right, but I like meat.  In your mouth, right?  Meat in my mouth, yeah.  Sure.  There's no such thing as a diet.  Just run around the block a couple times.  Lifestyle change.  Lifestyle change.  Just get an exercise a little bit.  That's the thing.  Atkins is not a lifestyle change, because eventually, Guy Fieri's going to give you a role.  Well, no, you can incorporate low-carb wraps and low-carb breads into your diet and stuff  like that. 
[04:02:30]  Eric, I see you enjoying a sandwich.  I'll eat that.  Can I have it?  Go fuck yourself.  Ouch.  What?  Mr.  Oh, you were going to eat that.  Yeah, but I had a little sandwich.  Fuck you.  Don't touch my food.  That's your food?  My food.  Oh, is it?  Fatso?  Yeah, it is my food.  Do you need it?  Do you need it?  Look at it.  Do you need it?  No, but you want it.  I'm hungry, because I had a little sandwich.  Oh, look at that.  I'm good.  Pile it in your fucking fat, dumb face.  That's right.  Pile it in your face.  Do you get annoyed when you're sitting there?  You're answering the phone.  Wait.  You're answering the phones.  You and Eric share a small rule.  We do.  We do.  And you're answering the phones, and right across from you, Eric, I mean, and he slouches 
[04:03:00]  most of the time.  Yeah.  And he slouches, and he lifts his arms up to stretch in the air, and like you said, his  belly just flaps out under his shirt, and you can see it over his pants.  Yes.  Does that annoy you, disgust you?  And that's after he's put the little powder in his drinks.  Sugar-free iced tea.  Sugar-free.  It's all chemicals.  What do you think those chemicals are doing to you?  Not good things.  Making it delicious.  Sturnyolo, I only invite you in,  because I know you like an argument, and Troy started going in on me for my eating habits 
[04:03:30]  because I only eat chicken, but I don't know if you've been listening.  All I heard was, pile it in your fat, dumb face.  Yeah, he's been going really hard on poor little sex pigs.  Because he's trying to justify being a fat fuck.  That's what he's trying to do.  What a greedy little pig to make fun of Troy for working out.  For trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle.  What did you just refer to Eric as?  A greedy little pig.  Listen, fuck face, I'm not saying anything about him. 
[04:04:00]  Yes, you were.  It's in response to you saying, why is everyone going to talk about me?  No one talks about you.  You talk about us, so we respond.  Yeah, I'm talking about you because we had a food show.  What's your response for you?  Why are you here?  And you're sitting there.  I invited him.  Yes.  He's a friend of mine.  It's his show.  Sterniolo.  Look.  What's the haps?  Hey, what's the haps?  Anybody who's listening?  What's the haps?  Anybody, you know, bosses in other departments?  Anyone from Raw Dog listening?  Yeah, Raw Dog.  By the way, Sterniolo was a big help in getting me on Comic-Con radio.  That was a big help in getting me that guest host gig on Raw Dog yesterday. 
[04:04:30]  You did a good job, pal.  But back to Eric.  It's disgusting.  Yeah, as far as I can see, Sterniolo's welcome in here to make fun of Eric anytime he wants.  I'd like to know some of Steve's thoughts on Eric.  It just has appeared.  Let me see something.  Hang on.  We have one minute.  I just think, I think Iraq is a really nice guy.  I just think you look behind those eyes and he's just a defeated soul.  And when Troy says, yeah, you're shoving steak down your gullet at just an immense rate.  And Eric's like, yeah, well, you work out a lot. 
[04:05:00]  Bag.  Jesus is coming down the hall.  That's Jason Shibiro.  He works here as well.  And this is coming from Steve that was really heavy and lost a lot of weight.  You did.  Roland's got the meat sweats, by the way.  I see him glaring.  Yeah, Roland, you wear that t-shirt a lot.  And I have to tell you, the pit stain's always in that t-shirt.  I don't know if you care.  If you don't care, I don't.  Oh, Mr. Blattery, if you're listening, Sam was making fun about his raise and stuff.  So I'm just wondering.  He has a radio.  He heard the whole segment.  No, but other stuff off the radio. 
[04:05:30]  How much did I rock, who ate more, I rock or Roland?  Roland.  Oh, Roland.  I probably ate more.  I fucking broke them.  I threw you under the bus.  This is Roland's day.  This is Roland's day.  You did a great job today, Roland.  I heard all the guests, and Eric did a great job of feasting.  Listen.  I'm jealous.  We got to wrap this thing up.  Eric was upset because he couldn't be down in the studio.  He was throwing a little temper tantrum.  He was.  You had to get the last word.  I love the dreams.  You had to get the last word.  And obviously, we have something to continue tomorrow on the acting show, because this  wasn't nearly enough time.  Roland, you did fantastic today. 
[04:06:00]  This was a fantastic show.  Great guest, top to bottom.  Yeah!  Great segment with Guy Fieri.  You did good work.  You put in the hours, and it paid off.  Troy, always a great job on the after show.  Sterniolo, great job.  Mark Zito, I'm hoping for the best for you today.  Everybody here did a great job, but you haven't had a chance to perform yet.  Joey Cox, always a pleasure.  Margo's from Yonkers.  I've grown to love you.  I don't remember the rest of your names, except for Geraldine and Mr. Geraldine. 
[04:06:30]  You both did well.  You're back on my good side, man who I didn't like at the beginning of the show.  So we're leaving on a positive note.  And to Jason Shapiro.  And to Jason Shapiro.  Shapiro.  Ron and Fez, comes up next.  Stay tuned for Mark Zito.  Goodbye, everybody.  But I tried it.  Right?  It was in my mouth.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.
