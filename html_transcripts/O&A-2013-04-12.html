<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the usual humorous, self-deprecating intro, highlighting the show's vulgarity.  Opie detailed his persistent, graphically described hacking cough, before transitioning to a discussion of extreme weather events, including tornadoes and a snowy Minnesota baseball game.  He then launched into a complaint about his pool cleaning service, two African-American men, who'd failed to open his pool, sparking a conversation about race and the potential racial implications of his comments.  The conversation shifted to the Masters golf tournament, focusing on a young Chinese golfer's impressive performance after a long flight, contrasting it with the lavish lifestyles of other players, including Tiger Woods and his girlfriend's presence. Opie showcased his new Samsung TV, comparing it to his previously damaged and discarded TV, before announcing an HBO contest for Louis C.K.'s special.  Jimmy Norton discussed his stand-up show, fielding a crude question about sleeping with a listener's sister.  The hosts then reacted to a listener's viral video featuring Bobo's dog, Mr. Malonegan, comparing its YouTube success to SiriusXM's own low view counts. The segment concluded with a lengthy, absurdly humorous playback of Opie's frustrating phone call with Verizon regarding the do-not-call list, teasing David Tell's upcoming appearance (but noting Drea's absence), and the playing of Psy's follow-up to Gangnam Style.

The next segment involved the hostsâ€™ crude and profane commentary on a television program or video, using derogatory nicknames for the people featured.  They then transitioned to a prank call segment stemming from a Jim Norton prank, discussing a missing Rolling Stones Crystal Head Vodka package gifted by Dan Aykroyd, with accusations of Aykroyd's theft. One host discussed his sobriety struggles and eventual disposal of the vodka.  This segued into discussions of "doggie steez," a man cave article, and a horse-fucking documentary gifted to Jim Norton.  They then analyzed a humorous baseball video of a pitcher fleeing an angry batter, followed by a lengthy, often confused and critical commentary on Jay-Z's new song about his Cuba trip, speculating on his motives and the political implications. This evolved into a discussion of US foreign policy hypocrisy regarding Cuba, China, and Saudi Arabia, touching upon North Korea and Kim Jong-un's leadership style, referencing *The Sopranos*.  The segment ended with a discussion of Psy's "Gentleman" and potential black remake of *Little Orphan Annie*.

The following segment featured a new song parodying "Gangnam Style,"  playing audio clips of "Wild Thing" and "Funky Cole Medina" (a song with explicit lyrics). A listener call detailed a dispute with Brett Weir, followed by a segment of profane "F-U" calls.  Jamie's Crying riff was played, followed by a lengthy discussion about Carol Burnett, analyzing her comedic style and contrasting it with the current comedic landscape, interjected with music and audio clips. A substantial portion focused on a humorous congressional hearing clip of Congressman Hank Johnson expressing concerns about Guam capsizing, prompting further offensive commentary from the hosts.  Comedian David Attell joined the show, discussing his cancelled *Dave's Old Porn* and upcoming gigs.  This segment included listener calls (one about a downsized sausage product), further discussion of Attell and Jim Florentine's shows, and a vulgar discussion of a pornographic clip, interspersed with personal anecdotes and discussions of Attell and Florentine's work.

The next excerpt began with a comedian (possibly a regular guest) discussing financial struggles and reliance on cigarettes.  This transitioned to a discussion of a major league baseball brawl, focusing on Zach Granke's collarbone injury.  The conversation then shifted to sexually explicit and offensive comments about Tiger Woods and his romantic interests. This segued into a sexually charged, offensive commentary on women's behavior and motivations based on items left at someone's house.  The latter half focused on offensive critiques of the movie "Valley Girl," its actors, and 80s actresses and child actors, with sexually charged commentary.  David Tell appeared as a guest, promoting his shows and Louis C.K.'s HBO special. The broadcast concluded with further sexually explicit jokes and offensive comments.  The brief after-show segment involved intern Alan recounting a bizarre story about a friend's hair dye allergy and a discussion about Third Eye Blind.

The final segment centered on intern Alan Thicke Jr.'s recent breakup, including his parents' disapproval of his Black girlfriend, her physical attributes, and twerking skills.  The hosts made numerous sexually explicit and racially charged jokes, examining pictures of his ex-girlfriend.  The conversation covered Alan's late arrival due to a hair dye emergency room trip, his continued sexual encounters with his ex-girlfriend post-breakup, condom breakage, morning-after pills, and speculation about Troy having sex with Alan's ex-girlfriend.  Listener calls requesting mixtapes were interspersed with the discussion.  Nicole from "the mashup" joined, and the conversation shifted to her attractiveness. The segment ended with promotional information for Troy and Who Kid's upcoming DJ gigs.

[00:03:00]  Never before has one radio show been so extreme. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, my God.  So vulgar.  Fuck you, I'm not a pussy.  I was accustomed to getting blown and having my ass eaten.  This is insane.  I mean, this is insane.  So flatulent.  Why don't we even try?  Let's just fart into the mics and call it a day.  This is the funniest shit ever.  It's a weird show.  That's what's real. 
[00:04:00]  That's the sex.  Tune in with no expectations.  Point simply.  The greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  Here we go.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Another four hours of love.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah, check, yeah, yeah, check it.  I'm up early in the morning, yawning. 
[00:04:30]  Put Opie at the nick, yeah, Jimmy Tranny pointing.  Opie like brother man, Ant wants to join the clan.  Jimmy on the other hand, he working the other hand.  Turn my headphones up.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  There are horrible people to say in this old.  Objectional human beings and I want you to know.  Unacceptable to my scene, but I'll give it a go.  50 Cent Larry King, Opie and Anthony show.  Go, go, I know you're feeling the flow.  But Opie's motherfucking, Jimmy's trying to get blown.  And we come to play around and we're still in the show.  I know you never heard nothing like this before. 
[00:05:00]  How important is the board?  Bored you'll never be.  And don't worry about getting shot when you're with Anthony.  Oh, yeah, on the edge of you, yeah.  Cause you really want to hear Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy.  Just keep it right here.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, check it out.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, 50, yeah.  Now I'm diving up in this bitch.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Booga, booga, booga, booga, booga. 
[00:05:30]  Enough of this plava.  Let's get this show on the road.  Larry King sounding gangster.  I fucking love that song, man.  What's a plava.  Yeah, he messed it up.  Plava.  I hope we didn't pay him for that.  Oh, yeah.  Someone just sent me a...  Hold on a minute.  Good morning, everyone. 
[00:06:00]  All right.  All right.  Whatever.  I was hacking all night again.  You're hacking?  I was hacking.  My throat is worse today than I was yesterday in my voice.  It's at that point now where it feels like there's a fucking party favor in my windpipe.  Where you try to breathe and it's just like...  Fucking...  I hate this shit.  It's got to be the weather.  It's trudge on. 
[00:06:30]  It's the weather going back and forth.  I don't know, because I started feeling this before the weather even got kind of nice.  I don't know.  Oh, I don't know.  For the love of God.  It's called Old Relapse.  Oh, why don't you shit in your hat?  Getting a little relapse.  Yeah.  It's only going to be 37 in New York today.  What?  Yeah.  Didn't we have spring?  It was 80 the other day.  It was 80 degrees two days ago.  It's going to be a high of 37.  Just a cold rain.  I just did the dude's job from the morning mashup, Sam Roberts. 
[00:07:00]  I just did a weather break.  Are you going to do about the extreme weather that's been in the middle of the country with the tornadoes?  Are you talking about Minnesota?  Dorothy.  They're playing a game in, like, fucking snow or something today.  I'm sorry.  Minnesota made our paper because they got some worker just fucking shoveling out shitloads of snow so they could play a game today.  Really?  What is it, a little interleague game today?  Is it the Mets? 
[00:07:30]  Mets and Twins?  And they're calling for more snow up there in Minnesota?  Snow.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Hey, Christ.  Wow, that's going to be that fucking cold today.  Yeah, it's only going to be 37.  37 degrees.  Good thing the pool guys that were supposed to open my pool yesterday didn't show up.  They just didn't show up?  That's not good.  Just didn't show up.  Did they give you a reason?  Every fucking year.  Same company, right?  This is tragic.  Yeah, it's the same company. 
[00:08:00]  This is tragic.  Did they give you a reason, at least?  No.  No.  Did you call them to get a reason why they didn't show up?  I have Keith handle it for me.  It's very tragic.  So he's...  You could have been swimming, like, what, next week?  It's a couple of...  I employ diversity at my house.  And my Hispanic people are very good.  The landscapers.  They come over.  They landscape.  It's fantastic.  The pool guys are African-American. 
[00:08:30]  They just didn't show up.  Did they run the company, though?  Or was it the boss, not Senator?  I don't fucking know.  So you're saying black people are lazy?  No, I'm not saying...  Are they responsible?  I'm not saying anything.  What are you saying?  I'm stating exactly what happened.  What are you saying?  I'm stating that the two African-American gentlemen that were supposed to open my pool  did not show or call my fucking residence.  So that's all I'm saying.  I'm not speculating as to the race has anything to do with them not showing. 
[00:09:00]  I'm just saying the two black guys that are supposed to open my pool didn't show up.  How do you know there were going to be black guys this year?  They're always black guys.  Maybe they were white guys this year.  Maybe there's a whole new staff.  Maybe they are.  Maybe they are, but I don't think so.  Were they responsible before this year?  If they were responsible, no.  No.  They haven't fixed a lot of the problems with the pool.  The pool cover tabs around the jacuzzi have not been reinstalled, and the cover falls into 
[00:09:30]  the fucking jacuzzi every year.  It's just I am employing a different group of people that will now come next week and  open my pool.  Oh, you're done with this company?  I'm done with this company.  And you're moving on to another company?  And I'm moving on to another company, and I will, when they show up, I will look at them and  I will judge as to whether they will be continuing to be my company.  By what color they are? 
[00:10:00]  That's how I fucking employ now.  That's how Anthony employs.  Did you ask the new company if they got black or white people working for them?  Nope.  That would be a terrible thing to do.  Now, you ought to just say, I'm going to have some soda.  Jesus.  You're so confusing.  Because I know what you ought to say.  Of course.  You won't say it.  I'm in chains.  Jesus.  Because I can't say what I want to say.  Dan, dan, dan, dan.  Now, you ought to ask the boss, I'm going to have some soda here.  What kind of soda do you think the guys would like?  If he says, well, they'd like a little bit of a Diet Coke. 
[00:10:30]  All right, good.  If he says, grape.  Grape.  Some Fanta.  You know.  I love grape soda.  I do, too, but you're weird.  I'm a huge fan of grape soda.  I can't drink it now.  I love grape soda, too.  I love it.  Great stuff.  I like grape soda.  Orange soda, not so much.  No, no.  Not so much.  I'll drink it.  But grape soda, root beer, absolutely.  Orange soda sometimes tastes like St. Joseph's baby aspirin.  Yes.  I don't like that.  It tastes, yes.  No, I'm enjoying that.  It tastes like you're a kid and mommy's giving you a little medicine.  A little medicide.  I agree with that. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  So now I got to, you know.  But I guess with the weather the way it is, it's no big deal.  I wasn't going to go swimming anyway.  Oh, God, no, man.  This fucking weather is ridiculous.  And what do you mean extreme weather?  Tornadoes where?  There was a shitload of fucking tornadoes and thunderstorms ripping up the old midsection  of the U.S. yesterday and last night.  So I guess, and it's just terrible.  You see the tragedy on the fucking news.  And all I was saying is, I got a tree on my house. 
[00:11:30]  Because, you know, somebody's tragedy.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  On my house.  I got a tree on my house.  On my house.  It's terrible.  Honestly, it's not that terrible because our own listeners had trees on their houses.  I know.  And they were tweeting pictures when that all went down with, what was it, Superstorm Sandy,  Hurricane Sandy.  What was it?  What was it called?  Superstorm.  And they're saying, next hurricane season, we have even a better shot of a hurricane 
[00:12:00]  hitting New York.  Which I didn't understand because we had one hit New York.  But they're like, you have even a better shot next season.  They say that all the time, though.  Maybe the shit is fucking shifting a little bit.  Just creepy when you live so high up in a building.  Oh, you get the fucking hippie, hippie shakes.  Hippie, hippie shakes.  Well, they say those buildings could handle it, but who the fuck knows, man?  That wind was raw.  I'm not worried about that.  I'm worried about the windows blowing in.  No, are you?  If I'm in the living room, I'm worried about being blown from one window through the other. 
[00:12:30]  Like if I'm frolicking.  Worried about being blown?  Yes, I am.  I don't like it.  Never happened.  So when you're like, I'm about 500 feet in the air and there's lightning all around you,  I swear, I have no idea.  So you can laugh if you have to.  What are the odds of fucking getting hit by lightning inside?  I really don't know.  I think it's like fucking very, very slim.  Non-existent almost, yeah.  It's extremely slim.  What has to happen?  I don't know.  Those buildings are built with lightning fucking shit on the roof.  And I mean, usually you see lightning hit buildings. 
[00:13:00]  It always hits the top of the building.  Right.  You have those little spires on top.  Yeah.  The lightning catchers and shit.  So for something to come through a window on the side, I don't think that's even fucking doable.  I don't know.  I believe you.  I have no idea.  It's just that highest point thing.  But when you're living through it and you see it all around you, you're like, what the fuck?  It's happened in houses.  Like, people have been standing by their sliding glass door in the back and they get slammed.  Is that because it hits the ground right before the door? 
[00:13:30]  I think so.  Or it hits the door frame or something at ground level.  I don't think in a building, though.  I think you're pretty.  Yeah.  And glass isn't very conductive.  So I think you're all right.  All right.  So I could just kind of press my stupid nose against the window and check it out.  You know what?  Wrap yourself in tinfoil.  Hold a golf club.  You would like that.  Get on the roof.  No.  What are you kidding?  Golf club.  Those golf clubs are lethal, man.  No kidding.  You're on a fucking grass.  It's lightning. 
[00:14:00]  Right.  And you're holding a fucking lightning rod.  Yeah.  Speaking of golf, I know you guys are into the Masters.  Oh, the Masters.  It's too bad.  You should take a peek.  It's a great tournament.  I've seen some of the clips.  They got that little fucking Asian kid, huh?  The Asian kid, he's 14 years old.  He's, uh, Tyneland, Guan.  I don't even know how to say his name.  Tyneland, Guan, Tiran, Guan, something like that.  I'll have an order of that with the noodles, please.  How many of these letters do you not pronounce at his name? 
[00:14:30]  Jimmy looked at me.  Huh?  I don't know.  Those Chinese names are impossible.  Well, that's how you pronounce a fucking Chinese name.  Someone's got to tell me which ones are silent, and then I could easily do this.  Yeah.  But I guess he's 14 years old.  He's a phenom.  Just to give you a little...  Where's he from?  ...perspective.  China.  Phenom.  It just sounds like a place he'd be from.  Oh, wow.  Jesus.  Phenom.  Jesus.  It's China, man.  You know, China's the type of place where they don't give every kid a fucking trophy. 
[00:15:00]  That's true, man.  So you're having super kids growing up in China and coming over here and making us look stupid.  Are they raising a nation as super kids?  They absolutely are.  Damn.  It's the first nation to go all in with the super kid thing.  So he's 14 years old.  He's winning tournaments all over the place in Asia, and he made the Masters.  He made the Masters.  He's 14 years old.  Tiger Woods played his first Masters when he was 19, just to give you some kind of perspective.  I do believe he was 19. 
[00:15:30]  And he shot one over yesterday, this 14-year-old kid.  Tiger shot two under.  Tiger, so a 14-year-old kid is only three strokes worse than Tiger yesterday.  Amazing.  14.  Doesn't have much of a shot of winning this thing, but it's pretty damn impressive.  And they're paying attention to him, you know?  He's definitely one of those weird oddities that they're going to keep the cameras on.  Well, and the other thing is he had to fly 26 hours, probably, like, in the luggage department. 
[00:16:00]  Because he doesn't have much money is my point here.  You don't think the Chinese government sponsors him very well?  Maybe they did.  Maybe they threw him a few bucks because, you know, it's great for China.  And he had to fly 26 hours before he played.  And he doesn't have the luxury of the other guys, where the other guys basically rent mansions for the week.  And they're hanging out for a week.  They got chefs and cleaning ladies and massages and all this shit.  They go all in.  This kid flew 26 hours, and a mere few hours later, he's on the course playing, pretty much. 
[00:16:30]  He's probably used to that lifestyle, though.  You think?  Get out there and perform for your nation, motherfucker.  And then all eyes are on Tiger Woods because, you know, he hasn't won a major in a while.  And the fucking guy just blows it.  What'd he do?  He's got his chippy out on the course.  What's that?  So everyone...  Oh, fuck.  So everyone's paying attention to his girlfriend there.  It's the first public appearance by his chick since he announced that he's going out with her.  The skier there.  What's her name?  Vaughn or something, right? 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  So everyone's like, holy fuck, there she is.  There she is.  It's such a major distraction for the guy.  Is that bad?  I think it might be.  You think it distracts him?  I think so.  How's he doing?  He's all right.  Oh, he's two under.  Yeah, he's two under.  The leaders are at, like, minus six, minus five, somewhere around there.  Wow.  He's still in it.  Freddie Couples.  Holy shit.  Freddie Couples is right up there.  Wow.  He's one off the lead, I believe.  Now, he hasn't really been in the fucking...  Mix in a while.  Yeah, in quite some time, huh?  He gets up there here and there, but... 
[00:17:30]  He's got his back problems.  Well, the problem with the old guy is the arthritis fucking kicks in by the third round and they're fucked.  They always start off great.  You always see these guys get a little excited because you remember the old days and then they shoot, like, an 85 the second round or the third round because they're just achy.  Just a disaster, yeah.  You know, you can't fucking blow off the achiness when you get older.  Time for the seniors tour.  But it's a sick tournament, man.  You should take a little look.  I probably will peek in over the weekend. 
[00:18:00]  Especially on that hundred fucking inch TV of yours.  Oh, yeah.  That would be awesome.  I got to tell you, my Samsung TV, the fucking picture on this thing is just amazing.  It is just amazing.  Stunning, right?  It is stunning.  I love it.  Are they the leaders?  Yeah, a lot of people are buying it.  They are, right?  Is it better than your last one?  Yeah, and the other one was a Samsung.  But whatever they did in the last six months, because I only had the last one for six months, the upgrade is amazing.  It could be the... 
[00:18:30]  I don't know what it is.  It's just amazing.  You had our guys put it in?  Yeah.  Did they put it in your last one, too?  Yeah.  Did they tune it?  I guess.  Because they go in and they tune that fucking thing up for performance and it's amazing.  Yeah, it's ridiculous, the picture on this thing.  Is it a plasma or the other one?  I don't know.  LH.  What is it?  LCD?  LCD.  LED?  I don't keep up with that technology.  LED, yeah.  What are the new ones now?  I just say, get me the best one and they do.  LED.  Is that better?  What's LCD? 
[00:19:00]  LCD.  It used to be LCD and plasma.  Liquid crystal diode.  Now it's all about LED.  Oh, really?  Okay.  And they're better than plasma?  Yeah.  Nobody gets plasma.  Well, plasma's out.  No.  Yeah, plasma.  They don't make it.  I know that much.  Plasma sucks a dick now.  I talked about this.  My plasma, I still love my plasma, but there's other ones coming out that I guess are better.  I use it at Compound West, the one that we got from K-Rock.  I still have that.  You still have that TV?  Yeah.  I use it over at my apartment.  I lost that TV, too.  Oh, what happened?  That one? 
[00:19:30]  I thought I told you on the air.  Is that the one that you stood on?  No, I upgraded my TVs, and I had it just kind of leaning up against the bedroom, the bed  in the guest room, excuse me, and I was going to bring it down to Philly to, you know, kind  of re-gift, and the kid might have pushed it over by accident, and that shattered that  screen.  Oh, Jiminy Cricket.  And then I'm such a loser, I brought it down anyway and said, hey, man, you know, you  never know.  Maybe they just fixed the screen.  It's a great TV. 
[00:20:00]  Oh.  So then they were burdened with a broken TV.  They had to get rid of it.  You brought them a broken TV.  No one fixed the screen.  No.  Oh, actually.  Okay.  You know what?  Even as I was telling that story, I felt like a complete douchebag.  I have to defend myself.  I loaded the TV in the car thinking that it was okay because it fell over on the rug.  Oh, okay.  And I swear to you, I looked at it.  It looked fine.  But then when I got down to Philly and I opened up my hatch and saw the TV in the sunlight, 
[00:20:30]  the bright sunlight, I saw that it was fucked.  So maybe it even happened on the way down to Philly.  I don't know.  I don't think so, though.  But then you still left it with them.  I wasn't going to bring it back to Philly at that point.  So you fucked?  But you left it with them.  Yeah, I mean.  You just left it in the car.  I should.  Tiger brought his chick because the rumor broke that he was back with his wife.  I don't know.  It's too much of a distraction because the papers are all about just, you know, she was at the golf course yesterday. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, I saw those pictures and shit.  So.  Cha.  Yes.  That was a good one.  Oh, you know what we have to do right at the top here?  We have $500 courtesy of HBO for the Louis C.K. special, which is tomorrow night.  Oh, my God.  Premieres tomorrow night at 10 o'clock.  10 p.m.  I encourage everybody to watch.  Louis is a huge friend of this show.  So let's try to get those numbers up.  He's going to be checking the numbers and he's going to want to see some good numbers. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, yeah.  The ONA Dude Bro Nation will fucking represent.  Oh, God, douchey.  Anyway, HBO gave us $500 because of our connection with Louis C.K.  And sometime today, we're going to play this again.  When you hear what I'm about to play, just call.  We're not going to set it up.  It's just going to fucking be played somewhere.  It could be played in the middle of commercials.  I don't know.  Oh, boy.  You got to listen.  And then what caller should we take?  Make it official.  Tenth caller or whatever? 
[00:22:00]  Tenth caller.  Tenth caller will win $500, courtesy of HBO and Louis C.K.'s great comedy special that  premieres tomorrow night.  All right?  It's like a tribute to Denny.  And, of course, they're all calling now because no one listens.  They half listen to a radio show.  Assholes.  They half listen to a radio show.  That's why we don't have to try anymore.  Write down these phone numbers and don't accept it.  So this is what we're going to play later.  So when you hear it again later, be the tenth caller or you'll win $500.  E-Rock, you fucking did it. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, E-Rock.  You pumped it up for us. 
[00:23:00]  He pumped it up in post.  He did a great job.  I thought you didn't want to go with the fat jokes.  E-Rock, is that you singing that part?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, yeah.  The fat fucking guy?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, because someone's going to sing it, so you might as well win the one.  Very cool.  So a little later on this morning, we'll play it again, and that's when you call and be  the tenth caller for the $500.  We couldn't make it more easy, even though they're still calling, thinking, give me a look.  You dumb motherfuckers. 
[00:23:30]  I heard it.  You dumb motherfuckers.  You play, dude.  Hi.  Who's this?  Oh, this is Fuckface.  All right.  What do you call him for?  Oh, just calling to say hi.  Just checking in, huh?  Just checking in.  What an asshole.  That's great.  At least he covered.  He saved himself.  How was Caroline's, Jimmy?  It was great, man. 
[00:24:00]  It was...  By the way, is Travis here?  Actually, I just sent him something.  Yeah.  I have a piece of production for the show.  Oh.  Oh, yes, I do.  Very good.  It was great.  I mean, the crowd was good.  It was a very nice turnout.  Nice.  Tonight and tomorrow, pretty much...  Tomorrow's totally sold.  Early show's sold.  There might be 20 tickets for the late show tonight.  I need a table for 12 tonight, I think.  No, they can do it.  They can do it.  They'll get you.  No, I got to figure out what show I'm going to.  Some of the crew came.  I knew Roland and Troy were there. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  And they sat stage right.  I never want people to sit where I could see them.  So I looked, but I was trying not to make any eye contact.  I saw Troy come with her.  I didn't even see Roland in the crowd.  I knew he was there.  And Sam was there with his beautiful wife and his brother.  I never met your sister before.  You fuck her?  No, I would never have done that.  Holy shit.  What's going on?  Well, I mean...  What the fuck happened?  I wanted to know if Jim fucked my sister. 
[00:25:00]  Holy shit.  She's a nice lady.  Wait, can you rewind how fucking...  That's really funny, but just how blunt and brutal that was?  That's a rude thing to say.  Holy mackerel.  I know.  That was a very rude thing, Sam.  I wish I would have said yes.  I'm such an asshole.  I answered it literally.  I was so shocked and abhorred by that question.  I was like, no.  That was terrible.  That was very funny.  I'm an asshole. 
[00:25:30]  You got it?  Yeah, I got it.  Okay.  His beautiful wife and his brother.  I never met your sister before.  You fuck her?  No, I would never have done it.  Holy shit.  You answered literally.  That was terrible.  Jeez.  Sorry, Sam.  You fuck her?  Wow.  One way to find out.  Sam, you're going to stand up for your family or what, man?  I mean, it was just a question.  It was just a question.  Did mommy like Jim Norton?  Yeah, she liked him a lot. 
[00:26:00]  She likes edgy shit, huh?  Yeah, well, you know.  I mean, Jimmy's more than.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  Jimmy's obviously more than edgy, but.  And she listens to the show every day, so she's familiar with you.  But was she laughing?  Yeah, she was laughing.  That's awesome.  She's yelling out monster rain or anything.  I wasn't that.  I was dirty, but I wasn't filthy.  No reason.  It just happened some nights.  Yeah, you're not.  Yeah, no.  So, yeah, I love the crowd.  So, where are we at with tickets?  A few available maybe tonight?  There might be 20 on the late show.  So, if you're.  Tomorrow. 
[00:26:30]  I mean, I'm sorry, Sunday.  Late show tonight or Sunday.  Sunday will probably be like last night was, which is close to.  This is probably about 60 open tickets.  Well, let's push Sunday show.  Yeah.  I think I'm going Sunday.  Okay.  Yeah, definitely.  Got to get a hold of Mr. Charles, Mr. Greg Charles, and get me a little table in the corner.  And it's going Sunday, and if it's sold out, he's going to just give somebody in the crowd $1,000, so.  Yeah, just fucking, you know, just do that.  Yeah, just for fun.  Actually, it'll be the person with me. 
[00:27:00]  And I worked with Jen Romano.  He's a friend of mine who I know a long time, and, you know, she works with Bobby Levy.  And Chris, what's his name?  Di Stefano.  Because the guys here have talked about Chris before, and I haven't seen him, but he was funny.  Nice.  But I've heard you talk about him and Troy.  Yeah, he's done the after show before.  He's great.  Oh, he has.  Okay.  He's like a hardcore Italian guy?  Yeah.  He's funny, though.  He's like...  Oh, yeah, I know.  He talks about his family and stuff.  Yeah.  Oh, good for him.  I like that.  That'd be great.  Landing gear, shmanding gear.  What happened?  You see that guy land that fucking plane on the belly? 
[00:27:30]  What was this, yesterday?  Yeah, it was like a little fucking, um, little, uh, private plane.  Holy fuck, really?  Put it down, barely...  Didn't even bend the propeller.  Just put it right down on the belly, straight down the runway.  Pretty amazing.  I didn't see it.  That's, like, one of the big videos they're playing on, uh, all the news.  And the baseball.  The base brawl between the Dodgers and Padres.  I love it.  Yeah, I love a good bench clearer, man.  It's pretty much the last sport where you could have a bench clearing brawl. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  They did away with that in hockey.  If you leave the bench when your guys start fighting, it's automatic, you know, you're thrown out of the game, suspension, all that.  But baseball hasn't figured that out yet.  They let everyone run out of the fucking dugouts and go for it.  Which I think is great.  You know what's really funny about baseball fights?  You get a hockey fight, right?  There's two guys.  They're usually fucking with each other.  A little stick up in the face.  And they start brawling.  Right.  Football, you might have, you know, something happen.  And two guys. 
[00:28:30]  But they're usually right next to each other.  Right.  There's that moment in baseball where the batter has to run to the pitcher.  Right.  And it's that in-between time where you're like, oh, here it comes.  This is good.  But it takes a little while for him to get there.  And during that time, it's like, it's this odd thing you don't see in other sport fights.  That would be a great montage.  Yeah, just that.  Just guys running.  Because you'd see his face like, you motherfucker.  You'd think their anger would subside before they got to the mound.  Like, ah, fuck it.  He does have that little bit of time to think it over.  But, you know, no. 
[00:29:00]  No, he charges like a bull.  And then everyone runs out of the dugouts.  That's the best.  Fucking the best.  That's got to be scary for a pitcher, though, when someone's charging at you.  Oh, man.  But if they had any real balls, they'd bring the bat with them.  That's true.  Bring the fucking bat.  And they usually know not to bring that fucking bat.  No, they never bring it down and come.  Never.  Because if you're in a fight, you'll just use whatever the fuck you can find.  And why doesn't the pitcher just wail a fastball right at his face?  Right.  Well, he doesn't have the ball.  He's usually thrown it at the batter.  True.  But he will throw the glove sometimes. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, the glove.  As his first defense, he throws the glove as the guy's running out.  That's a funny one, too.  Yeah.  How funny would it be if a pitcher just decides to take off when the guy comes running at him?  Hilarious.  And just starts running around the outfield?  Would he be known as a pussy?  And there he goes.  Or would he be the funniest man alive if he did that?  Hilarious.  But it's a fine line.  But the guy chasing him.  But if you just took off for the outfield.  Oh, you'd be a pussy.  You think?  Yeah. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  What if you run in such a way where you're mocking the guy?  Has anyone done this?  Running backwards and pointing at him?  Yeah.  Laughing at him?  Has anyone ran away from the charging batter?  That's the sports question today.  I'm sure it's happened at some point.  I think that would be hilarious in the end.  Tanner Boyle ran away from some of the umps.  He did.  That's very, very true.  I love that movie.  Not so much the remake where the kids weren't allowed to drink beer.  That was the second one, though.  I believe the coach was Gold's own Bill Devane. 
[00:30:30]  Fucking show off Bill Devane.  Hi, I'm Bill Devane.  My dad told me to buy gold.  I listened to him and I did very well.  Right, Bill?  He's on a horse.  Oh, shit.  Bill's flying a plane.  Oh, Bill's on his property by his big tree.  Talking about his gold.  Not so well if he's doing the infomercial.  Yeah, true.  Wouldn't he just keep his mouth shut and enjoy his riches?  Buy his gold.  Right, of course.  Let's say hi to Doug in Hoboken, New Jersey. 
[00:31:00]  I got a good joke.  Bill Devane.  I don't know how to Bill Devane.  I ain't got no vein building kit.  Hey, Doug, what do you got for the show today?  Take a look at a Google.  Nolan Ryan.  I think it's Ventura.  Nolan Ryan was about 45 years old.  And Ventura charged the mound.  Nolan Ryan gets him in a headlock and gives him the business.  Just fucking killed him.  The business?  Oh, I remember that fight.  Okay.  But we're looking for the one where maybe the pitcher ran away.  That's every other one.  There's another one where a catcher, I mean a batter, kicks the catcher in the head and 
[00:31:30]  then runs out to get the pitcher.  Hold on.  Wow.  Why would you run after a fucking future Hall of Famer?  They had to do in a headlock.  Oh, he's just beeping his shit out of him.  And Nolan Ryan was 45 at the time?  Yes.  The funny thing is Ventura thought about it.  He started walking to first with the bat in his hand and then went like, no, I'm going  to fucking get this guy.  Oh, he put him in a headlock.  Nolan Ryan looks like a guy that didn't fucking play.  He's like, all right, you want to do this, I'm going to fucking put you in a headlock and 
[00:32:00]  beat the shit out of you.  Badass.  He's just a bad dude, Nolan Ryan.  You think?  Yeah, man.  He was just a fucking...  I mean, I give Robin Ventura a little credit for actually charging a guy of that legendary status.  It's funny, you know, it's a fucking throw at me, I'm going to charge it.  Someone's upset with Jim Norton.  Why?  I can't believe that.  It's probably because there's not enough of me in this world.  That's true.  Who is this person upset?  Who are you and why are you upset with Jim Norton?  No, this is Bobo.  Who's Bobo?  I don't know. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, my God.  I don't know Bobo.  Bobo what?  Oh.  This is Daniel.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  From YouTube, Daniel Carlin.  So you're mad at Jim.  What's up?  What did Jimmy do?  No, what happened was I was upset when I heard two days ago with the tickets.  I don't know what you mean.  You're not explaining yourself very well.  No, I didn't get tickets to see Jimmy.  Look, man, I've told you before.  I like you and you're a good dude.  But you yap every time you come to a show. 
[00:33:00]  And it's not that I don't like you, but I'm not going to give you tickets to my show that you can chat through.  You know, that's why I didn't get you tickets because you're, again, a good guy, but you talk a lot during the show.  I promise I'm not going to.  No, no, I know that, but you kind of promised that before and you did anyway.  And, you know, I think you can't help yourself.  I think you mean what you say when you say you won't talk.  I don't think you're lying.  But I don't, any more than someone with diarrhea can't not shit. 
[00:33:30]  Like, that's like if you came with diarrhea and said, I promise not to shit in my white linen trousers.  I would believe that you were sincere, but you would eventually shit in your white linen trousers because it's just what someone with diarrhea does.  Well, that's kind of what you do.  You chat a lot.  And you're very chatty.  You're chatty Cathy.  And you like to chat.  Not about things that are interesting to anyone.  Bobo, comment?  I really promise.  We won't.  That's the, no, that's like the fucking scorpion and the frog. 
[00:34:00]  He promises he'll, he won't sting you.  Just bring me across the fucking river.  Maybe we could happen.  Maybe you could give him the shittiest seat in the whole place.  Well, you know, the problem was that he's like, way in the fucking corner in the back.  It's like, Bobo, why did you talk?  He goes, because I'm Bobo.  Yeah.  You knew I was an adult when you come to me.  You knew I was an adult.  Because I'm Bobo.  All right. 
[00:34:30]  So, Kenny, if you're listening, no.  Make sure he does not get tickets.  Sorry, bro.  Bobo, please, the right ticket next time.  Nah.  Yeah.  Yes, I can't do it.  Just, you just fucking get him two tickets.  No.  I can't do it.  No.  But you're just going to be pissed off on Monday.  You're just going to be mad on Monday.  And we're going to have to fucking deal with it.  He's the thing.  He's got to sit in the back.  No.  In the back.  Against the wall.  Against the wall.  Who are you bringing with you?  No. 
[00:35:00]  If it's Sunday, I'm taking my mother.  Okay.  Don't give him a plus one.  Just let him make him come by himself.  I'll let him bring his mother.  Maybe he'll have a keeper.  He's a nice guy.  Maybe a plus one will be his keeper.  And be able to tell him, shh, shh, be quiet.  As long as you sit in the back, Kenny, get him and his mother tickets.  Can we put, like, duct tape on his mouth?  No, I just don't want him to talk.  He's just going to talk.  Imagine him sitting there with duct tape on his mouth the whole time.  Would you accept if Kenny put duct tape on your mouth before the show, just to guarantee  you're not going to yap? 
[00:35:30]  That's what it takes.  Yes, they would.  Hannibal Lecter mask.  Yeah, what kind of mask can we put on him?  A ball gag.  Can we put a plastic bag over your head?  Tie it real tight?  Like AJ in Season 6?  Put a brick on your foot and send you to Anthony's pool?  All right.  Are you done, Bobo?  Yeah, I am.  How's your viral video going? 
[00:36:00]  It's going good.  Got a lot of views.  Got a lot of views.  Bobo, you spelled Maloona getting wrong.  Yeah, I do know that.  I should have maybe looked at that little tag on the screen.  But you don't even understand that you could go back in and edit that and spell it correctly.  What's done is done.  Edit, schmed it.  To him, what's done is done, right?  Brilliant.  Yes.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm not going to correct that one.  What's the next?  What's the next video, Bobo? 
[00:36:30]  No, I can't spoil the next one, but it does star me and Mr. Maloona again.  Oh, well.  All right, good.  I hope it stars a fucking car as well.  I'm actually writing a little...  Dude.  Mr. Maloona...  How's this video got 119,000 views?  This video went viral.  Holy shit.  I told you it would go viral.  Dude.  I told you.  119.  Yesterday, it was at...  Didn't we play it yesterday?  Yeah.  And what?  It was at 20,000.  Now it's 120,000.  It's gone.  It's gone.  Yeah.  That's a mistake.  It ain't a mistake, man. 
[00:37:00]  It's not a mistake.  YouTube is tough with the fucking views.  He cheated the numbers.  Unless this guy is watching his video over and over again.  There's 252 comments.  Wow.  That kind of adds up to, you know, the ratio-wise.  Wow, Bobo.  Bobo.  You got a viral video where I think anything over 100 is, you know, more or less viral,  right?  What are people saying?  And then there's uber-viral.  Yeah.  A lot of tuss, fucking funny, fucking hilarious. 
[00:37:30]  119,000.  Yeah.  Bravo to Bobo.  Way to go.  You're a star.  Yep.  I had a feeling it would, all right?  All right.  I had a feeling it would have, right?  I wasn't even filming it for the internet.  This was just a video that I was just wanting to film some of the footage.  I wasn't filming it for the internet.  He didn't even fucking try.  This motherfucker.  And then my mom saw the video after I saw it. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, look at the spike.  Something happened yesterday and it spiked like crazy.  Did it get linked somewhere?  It had to.  Where did it get linked?  It spiked yesterday.  It's checkeddunce.com.  Does anyone know where this video got fucking posted?  Because this thing definitely got posted somewhere.  It went, it was getting no views and then yesterday.  Could you play it?  You bet I can.  I want to hear it.  Is that all-star hip-hop?  I love this.  Dumb motherfucker.  There's so many good parts of that video. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  I like when he gets all tripped up.  Mr. Malone.  He runs out of steam on the name Malone. 
[00:39:00]  Mr. Malone.  He's all pissed at the other dog for eating the bacon.  Yeah.  The other dog ate the bacon.  It's not about the other dog.  It's about Mr. Malonegan.  That's the twist.  He's just Mr. Malonegan again, Mr. Malonegan, Mr. Malonegan.  Over and over and over.  He finally gets Mr. Malonegan on the stoop.  Yeah.  Goes to give him the bacon.  The other dog swipes it.  It's a story arc.  But instead of acknowledging that he has to take credit for outsmarting the dog.  Right.  And say, I got you on tape.  But the thing has done 100,000 views in the last couple of days. 
[00:39:30]  Someone says it was on Reddit.  Made it to Reddit.  People are saying.  It did 100,000 views like yesterday.  That's all it takes.  You get on Reddit.  Forget it.  It's over.  His video has beaten just about every video SiriusXM has ever posted.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  By like a lot.  Tenfold.  Astounding, right?  Let's take a look at what SiriusXM is doing.  All right.  Give us some of their big videos of the past few months.  I want to see who he's beating out. 
[00:40:00]  Scroll down.  To be fair, everything's had some time.  Oh, wow.  This is great.  Chris Hardwick was in here.  He's hot online.  Sure.  People talk about this guy.  Yeah.  329 views on that video.  They need to hire a social media person.  We talk about this all the time, but they fucking stink at this.  This is huge. 
[00:40:30]  How does a video only get 300?  It's almost impossible.  How many did it?  Mistakes.  People stumbling on the link by error.  It should be more than that.  It's so easy to work these videos, too, man.  There's just tiny little things.  And I'm not going to fucking tell them what I know.  Fuck that.  Pay me and I'll fucking tell you.  I wouldn't either.  Probably not even typing in keywords.  No.  There's all sorts of little things you got to do with these videos.  And I ain't telling them shit. 
[00:41:00]  Could you tell me later?  Yeah, I'll tell you.  There are little things you could do.  Oh, wow.  This must be cool for people.  Clive Davis commenting on Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan.  Yeah.  It's a legend talking about the legends.  Pretty cool.  There's 607 views on that video.  That's embarrassing.  That's embarrassing for a media company.  Yes, it is.  And they have a whole platform where they can promote it.  Every channel could have a little promo saying, you know, make sure you check out our videos.  Right, with updates on it.  Jay, this week, see so-and-so uploaded. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, it's embarrassing.  Kevin Hart or fucking, you know, One Direction, whoever it is.  They got, I don't even know how many channels here.  What do we got, like?  A hundred something?  Oh, I thought about 17.  How many channels does SiriusXM have?  There's probably like 200 channels.  So across the board, they can have a promo on every single channel and funneling them to their fucking site going, boom, check this out.  Tony Bennett.  How many views does the Tony Bennett interview have?  Tony Bennett talking about Sinatra?  Tony Bennett.  Yeah.  742. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, 742,000?  No, 742.  Oh, see, that's different.  We could make a video of Jimmy farting, and we don't even show Jimmy's face, just the back of his fucking pants, and all you hear is a fart.  I could guarantee 20,000 to 30,000 views overnight.  That would get more than if you did show my face.  Just my ass gassing is a rare item.  It's a rare gift.  Just want to film it in the worst way possible, and it would easily be 20,000 to 30,000 overnight.  Bobo, congratulations.  You got the tickets for Jimmy's show on Sunday if you could keep your mouth shut. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, you got to be quiet.  But if you yap once, Kenny's going to fucking throw you out.  All right.  He's going to throw you up the stairs and out the door.  Don't worry.  I won't, and neither will my mom.  All right.  And congratulations on your viral video.  All right.  Thank you.  He doesn't even know.  He doesn't even know it's viral.  He doesn't know how to spell his dog's name.  He's Bobo.  The Bobo.  Oh, my God.  I have a... 
[00:43:00]  Waiting for my piece of...  Production?  Oh, Travis comes in on cue.  I have it.  You got it.  Thank you.  You hear about Bobo, Travis?  I did.  He's got a viral video.  I know.  The Bobes.  You're making a lot of money off of that, right?  Jimmy, does this need a setup?  No.  Well...  Hang on.  Oh, Travis.  Travis.  Yes.  Jim, it's up to you.  I pulled the full thing, but in two tracks.  If you want to go right to it...  No, we can do the first one.  I'll tell you what happened. 
[00:43:30]  I got a call yesterday on my old phone.  It's going to ruin it.  About...  It was from fucking Verizon.  And they wanted to...  And I said, take me off this.  Stop calling me for updates.  Oh, boy.  And they're like, okay, we'll put you on the do not call list.  It takes about a month to go through.  Like, whoa.  Why does it take a month?  Well, that was my question.  Oh, I'm sorry.  No, no.  But I mean, that's exactly the reaction I have.  Why is it take a month?  It's ridiculous.  So I picked up my other iPhone, my new one.  And I...  This picks up in the middle. 
[00:44:00]  This probably picks up a minute or two in.  It's not that far.  How long is this whole thing?  Two minutes.  Six minutes total?  Oh, is it six minutes total?  Who cares?  We don't have to listen to the whole thing, but...  Well, no.  I mean, the second track is about four minutes, and I think everyone's going to want to listen.  Okay, because the first track, I was just asking her...  No, I want to listen to every second of the six-minute Jim Norton call.  Okay, you'll want to.  Yeah, absolutely, I want to.  I'm recording from one phone to the other on speakerphone.  To those 30 days, you'll be completely removed.  Wait, now, can you explain to me, if you're calling me and I'm saying, put me on the do 
[00:44:30]  not call list, why does it take 30 days just to put me on the list?  I don't understand that.  It just, that's the leeway that it gives.  It says that it takes about 30 days to fully get you off of the calling list.  Now, like I said before, you might not receive a call within the next 30 days, but in the  mishap that you do receive another call, just explain that you've been asked to be put on  the do not call list, and then after those 30 days, you'll be completely removed. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, so wait a minute, so I have to explain to somebody, like, doesn't it get put in the  computer, or do you guys, like, kind of write these numbers down by hand and pass them around  the office?  I'm not sure how that works.  No, I disposition the call as do not call.  So you...  It goes into the computer system...  Sure.  ...and then it filters through, and then, like I said, it does take up to 30 days to filter  through.  Now, I'm not sure what she means filters through, like, for instance, if I pay my bill, the entire 
[00:45:30]  Verizon system knows I've paid my bill immediately.  How come it doesn't take a month for my bill to filter through?  It usually does take up...  It does take up to three days when you do your billing as well.  That's what I'm going to do here, because I do see that you're very upset here, is I'm  going to manually... I'm going to write your phone number down, I'm going to hand it right  over to my manager, and I'm going to have her manually put you on the do not call, okay? 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, I'm just... I'm not even that upset.  I'm just curious, because it's 2013, and with Twitter and all of these things, I've been...  I'm just amazed that you can't just hit a button, like a check, something that says  do not call, and then Verizon just kind of knows not to call for these updates, you know,  these silly updates.  No, that was just this...  Oh, boy.  But that's what you deal with with these people.  Right.  Put me on the fucking do not call list, and they filter through...  And then you've got to be angry, and then they'll do it manually.  Yeah.  So why wouldn't they just do it manually to begin with? 
[00:46:30]  Absolutely.  Why not just honor your request immediately?  Right.  And manually isn't manually.  No, it's bullshit.  It's just, oh, okay, I've got to check this stupid button on the... this thing on the  screen right now.  Yeah, there's no one running with papers.  No, of course not.  It's utter nonsense.  Stop it.  So then the call continues?  Yeah, of course I felt...  Right.  Yeah, I mean, yeah, that's the reason we're giving you a call is to give you savings off  of your monthly services.  And you can also check out the website.  It's VerizonWireless.com because it looks like that you could be saving around $20 a month 
[00:47:00]  off your monthly bill.  That's a lot of money.  Oh, no.  It's a good amount of money.  20 bucks.  You know, I mean, that ain't small peanuts.  Yeah, it's because we came out with a new plan.  We came out with our new Shared Everything plan.  And what it does for you, it gives you unlimited talk.  Unlimited talk?  Your bill would actually go down by $89.98.  Unlimited talk.  My mother said, I talk too much. 
[00:47:30]  She says to me, Chippy, you...  Home run, Chippison.  She said, I talk too much.  She said, Chippy, you like a little...  You like to jibba-jabba.  Yeah, it was just taking a look.  You have...  With your plan, you have two lines.  You actually have your cell phone line, and then you have a mobile broadband service.  And I got a secret phone that I call up other people with.  I got a secret phone that no one... 
[00:48:00]  It's another phone no one knows about that I call other people with.  You know what I'm saying.  You're actually using it.  What's that?  Your mobile broadband.  A broadband.  It's like that you're using your mobile broadband.  A broadband.  Wasn't that the Runaways with Joan Jett?  Got a zero.  Oh, God.  Yeah, that's your jet pack, your mobile broadband service.  And then you have your cell phone line.  What's a jet pack?  You got unlimited for that line. 
[00:48:30]  And then for your plan, you had a seven gig plan.  What's a jet pack?  What's a jet pack?  Is that like the football package or something?  Because I like the Cowboys.  No.  Home run, Chippison.  I don't like going online. 
[00:49:00]  I'm going to talk to X and a four gig data pack.  Going online, I got no patience to stand online.  My mother always said, Chippa, you're always in a hurry.  What's the rush?  You're rushing to the next accident or something, you know?  Yeah, my mother would always, she's a marvelous woman, but she says that I rush around town  too much.  She's like, what's the hurry?  She's like, what's the hurry?  Slow down, Chippa.  So, yeah, like I said, you know, you can be saving money off your monthly bill as I'm 
[00:49:30]  taking a look at it here.  You have the two lines.  You should be saving around $10 a month off your service.  Two lines, got to put them on a mirror and get zooted.  Okay, sir.  Oh, she's not even laughing anymore.  I do want to thank you so much for your time.  If you do have any questions or concerns, you can give us a call back.  My telephone number here, it is, the 866-4.  Is that your cell phone?  I'm going to go ahead and place you on our do not call list, okay? 
[00:50:00]  Is that your cell phone that you just gave me?  Am I allowed to call that?  Because if I had a question, could I text it?  You wouldn't be able to text it.  You could call it.  Would you remember me if I said, like, yo, it's Chippa.  That's my nickname, Chippa.  It doesn't bring it directly to me.  You'd have to ask for me personally.  Oh, because you got a nice voice.  We could talk or something.  What the hell do I know?  It doesn't make no sense. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, God.  All right, James.  Well, I do thank you so much for your time and being a Verizon Wireless customer,  and you have a wonderful day.  You call me Chippa, though.  Okay, Chippa.  You have a wonderful day.  Chippa.  Chip Chippison.  I prefer that.  It's like my stage name.  James is stupid.  Chip Chippison is my stage name.  Hello?  What the fuck?  It doesn't make no sense. 
[00:51:00]  Amazing how she just plods ahead, right?  No kidding.  I love how at the beginning she was...  She was enjoying it.  She's laughing.  And then she didn't want anything to do with it.  I didn't want to be too, too rude with her just because that's my phone,  and I don't want them to fuck up my phone and turn it off.  I don't want to curse at her or say, cocksucker.  She's so not taking your phone number and running it down the hall to her manager anymore.  Nope.  No way.  That's great, though.  Yeah, just chip them.  Just fucking chip people. 
[00:51:30]  They will leave you alone.  I love it.  That was great.  She's so satisfying.  To just know she's fake laughing.  She was so fake.  No, she was laughing at first.  I don't know.  It was that, ah.  At what point did you decide to completely abandon the phone call and just have fun?  Well, I just realized that I'm dealing with a fucking, just a dumb, non-connected, corporate  fucking mouthpiece.  There's no.  Just reading.  Yeah.  I just, I just get annoyed. 
[00:52:00]  Mm-hmm.  Very good.  Jesus.  Very good.  Want me to talk to your fucking pool people?  Yeah, maybe you should.  Hey, send those too lazy you-know-what's out.  Fucking guy's got to do this.  Yeah, I don't think that would work for you.  No?  No.  All right, let's take a break.  We got David Tell coming in today.  Very cool.  What about Drea?  Is she coming in or no?  I don't think so.  Probably not.  Why?  Why'd she blow us off?  She probably found out. 
[00:52:30]  I doubt it.  She came in later, right?  Yeah.  But she, she blew off like television before us.  She didn't even wake up.  So was she still in town?  I don't think so.  I think that's why she's not coming in today.  That was it, huh?  I know.  We got something right after the break.  Remember Gangnam Style?  Mm-hmm.  He's got his second song.  It's the one we've talked about.  His follow-up.  Oh, yeah.  We were wondering, what's it going to be?  What's it going to sound like?  Is it going to be a big hit?  Oh, man.  I can't wait. 
[00:53:00]  I think we're looking at a one-hit wonder here.  What?  I don't know.  I hear this one's actually better.  Better?  Better?  Oh, Frank was better?  I haven't heard yet.  We'll listen to it cold next.  Stay there.  We'll return after these messages.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  I just want to say one thing, y'all.  I want to say one thing.  This is the O.P. Anthony Channel.  O.P. Anthony Channel.  O.P. Anthony Channel. 
[00:53:30]  O.P. Anthony Channel.  What's this guy, think he's an Indian?  What is he, a goddamn asshole?  What the fuck is he doing?  Not ever.  No way.  Now he's Johnny Hammersticks.  Hammering away like he's friggin' Tommy Noble.  What the hell is he doing?  Think she's got to go and bossing over.  No way.  No way. 
[00:54:00]  What is this garbage?  What is this?  Oh, I'm king of the trees.  I'm the tree meister.  I count on them.  What, sometimes I pry, I like to stealst.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, right.  This guy's a faggot.  Guy's some sort of faggot Indian in the teepee.  Ooh, this guy thinks he's Captain Knots.  Thinks he's Captain Ty and Knots.  When everyone needs some knots tied, they go to him.  Bullshit.  Bullshit. 
[00:54:30]  Bullshit.  They stole-  This woman's such a bitch.  Thinks she's Miss Sand.  Drinking out of cups.  Being a bitch.  I bet her fist.  I bet her fatalisk.  Burned.  Pat her skum pat her little kid in the background.  Fucking going crazy.  Who's this guy?  Mr. Balloons.  Mr. Balloon Hands.  No way.  No way.  Get real. 
[00:55:00]  Like those things.  Mr. Walkway.  Mr. Walk down me.  I'm the walkway.  Lead me to the building.  Fuck you.  5-6-4-3.  Yeah, right.  You're some stupid bitch.  Who paid for that floor?  Not me.  No way.  Never made a no floor ever again.  Not once.  Not never.  Nope.  Whose chair's that?  Who bought that goddamn chair here?  That's not my chair.  Not my chair, not my problem.  That's what I say. 
[00:55:30]  No way.  Stupid dresses.  Stupid flowers.  Lighthouses rule.  You don't like the lighthouse?  You suck.  What is this?  Seahorse captain?  What is this?  Seahorse seashell party?  Who didn't invite me?  Why didn't I get invited?  Seahorse sea hell?  What is this?  Get real.  I'm in love with seahorses.  I'm in love with them.  They're so beautiful and cute.  I'm in love with the seahorses.  They're fucking unreal.  I love them. 
[00:56:00]  They're like all the clocks.  I love them.  I love seahorses.  And I love looking at them.  And I love seashells.  I love seashell things.  I love things with seashells and seahorses on them.  Like blankets.  And towels.  And little bags.  I love them.  Seahorses.  Forever.  The show continues.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  I can't even, uh, I can't even participate in one of my favorite activities.  Singing.  My, uh, my voice is gone.  Hmm. 
[00:57:00]  Jesus.  You're coughing all over Mick.  It's terrible.  Jesus.  41 years ago today.  Exile on Main Street.  Nice.  A great LP.  Ha, ha, ha.  That's so fucking great.  What?  I watched that fucking...  The baseball brawl.  Yeah.  Couple things.  Let's make it prank caller day, E-Rock.  I heard what you did in there.  Prank caller.  Prank caller.  Courtesy of, uh, Jim Norton's little prank call he did with, uh, Verizon at the house yesterday. 
[00:57:30]  Today is prank caller day, so pick some of the good ones.  You gotta get red in there.  Gotta get the red.  Two bar.  I am.  Two bar.  And, of course, some of the, uh, the, uh, the jerky boys.  But you gotta go first album, please.  Oh, man, yeah.  First album.  Although there was some good tracks on the other ones.  There was, but, you know...  That first one album.  The classic Get Brit Weir I Said.  Yeah.  It's the super across the way.  Baby!  Fuck!  Hey, what happened to the Rolling Stone thing from yesterday? 
[00:58:00]  Uh, when he...  Did Dan Aykroyd take it away from us?  Dude, dude.  When he said, like...  He knew he fucking blew it, right?  Hey, I gotta take it with me to the next interview.  I'm like, that is gone.  And it is.  He teased us with this Rolling Stone package with the Crystal Head vodka in it.  I wasn't even gonna take it.  Like, like...  Oh, I was so gonna take it.  I'm gonna get one.  I'm gonna buy one to put in my bar, but I wasn't gonna take it.  But when he was like, yeah, I need to take it to the next interview, I was like, oh, boy,  that's it.  Yeah, he left it in the middle of the table here, whatever you want to call it, the console, 
[00:58:30]  and, uh, and then realized he only had one, so he said, fuck, I gotta...  He goes, but I'll bring it back to you guys.  Sure you will.  Hey, uh, Sam, what happened to the Rolling Stones Crystal Head vodka package thing?  Why didn't he bring it back?  He definitely...  I don't know.  He took it with him.  But he said he was gonna bring it back.  He just kinda needed...  We needed it for the other interviews.  Yeah, he was bullshitting you.  The second he took that, it was gonzo.  And I wanted the live Rolling Stones CD that comes with it. 
[00:59:00]  I could try to find a bootleg of it for you.  Yeah.  I have a big bottle of vodka with it.  It's in a big skull.  Like, those were smaller skulls.  I got, like, a life-size skull size.  That seems like a pretty big bottle, what he gave us yesterday.  Nah, I have a...  It's the size of an actual skull, the bottle I have at home.  Very cool.  Yeah, fucking A, motherfucker.  Baby!  It was good, that vodka.  Oh, God.  I was out to dinner, and I was discussing that last night. 
[00:59:30]  How, like, it's probably, like, not a good idea for someone that's been in recovery for so long to have that in their house.  It's almost like a, in case of emergency...  Who the fuck are you to disgust me?  Oh, Jesus.  Who the fuck are you to disgust me?  We were just talking about you, but not in a bad way.  I, uh...  You know what I'll probably do when I get home?  I'll just dump the vodka out.  Yeah.  You have no other alcohol in your house, right? 
[01:00:00]  I have a little wine in the house for somebody who came over once and had some wine.  I have a half-bottle.  I'll just dump it out, too.  I never thought that.  That half-bottle's got to be old by now.  Oh, yeah, it probably is.  Yeah.  That shit doesn't keep.  Oh, it doesn't?  What kind of wine was it?  Um, a Port de Lachneur.  Ooh.  It is from 1851.  A Port de Lachneur.  No, you know what?  I didn't know that.  I'll dump it.  Is it white?  Is it, like, a nice Merlot?  Is it a cab?  Oh.  Is it a Meritage?  A nice Merlot?  I don't know what a nice Merlot is. 
[01:00:30]  I don't know any of that shit.  Merlot Thomas?  Fucking cool me or you're incorrigible.  Double DWIs.  I don't know what to do.  Like, because the vodka looks...  Oh, you know what I can do?  I can fill it with water.  It looks pretty cool like that.  Just fill it with water.  Because I like the way it looks with the liquid in it.  Yeah.  Wow, you think you'll be tempted to have it in the house?  No, but like you said...  It should just not be in your house.  It just shouldn't be in the house.  God forbid you have some kind of a huge fucking...  Fucking, like, mental pressure on you. 
[01:01:00]  Just to have that there is...  Like, and it's probably a 99.9% that you wouldn't do anything.  But just to have it available there, it just seems like something that wouldn't be great.  But what I should do also is dump it for another reason.  If it ever fucking falls off and breaks, I don't have vodka all over my floor.  That's true.  I'll just dump.  I don't need liquor.  I like the fucking thing...  Wait, you're giving Jimmy drinking advice.  I know.  Because I know how easy it is to just grab that fucking bottle. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  I talked to it first dramatically.  Well, here goes nothing, Mr. Skull.  Here goes how many years?  26.  26 years.  Right down the old shitter.  So, yeah, I'm going to dump it out.  Thank you very much, Roland.  Thank you.  Yeah, just fill it with water.  It'll still look good.  I won't even fill it with water because of the autographs there.  I'll just carefully dump it out the side and fucking put a cap on it.  Here's the other problem.  You put water in it and you get rid of the vodka and then all of a sudden you got a hot  nuss over your house.  Now what's going to happen? 
[01:02:00]  I'll just fucking...  I'll say this.  When she's looking at the skull, I'll just jazz on her.  Is it a nussie or a nuss?  Hot nuss?  Yeah.  What happens if you have a hot nuss and you're thinking about doing the hokey pokey?  Right.  Especially if you're trying to go doggie steez.  Yeah.  What if you're going to go doggie steez?  I can't fucking sit here.  And all of a sudden that vodka is no longer vodka.  And you're like, fuck, all I need is to give this fine nuss a shot and I'm going to go doggie steez.  Right.  Doggie steez? 
[01:02:30]  Man, that's not cool.  You know, we might have to take your dude bro card away.  Yeah, the chick's just sitting there going like...  So bad.  The dude bro card, by the way, it's shaped like a penis and you put it in your asshole and walk around.  You pour a glass for your date.  She's like, this is water.  What's a date?  For your nuss.  For your nuss.  Oh, gosh.  Dude bros don't date.  They just find hot nusses.  She's like, what type of swoot vodka is this?  That's right. 
[01:03:00]  Swoot.  Yeah, you don't want her to say swoot.  No.  She's trying to go doggie steez.  There was a...  No, steez.  Steez.  Steez.  Steez.  Doggie steez.  Doggie steez.  Doggie steez is what that fucking guy went through in Oregon.  The guy that got fucked with his horse.  A steed.  Doggie steez.  He took a doggie steez.  He was in Seattle, I think, right?  Was it Seattle?  It might have been, yeah.  Pacific Northwest pervert, whatever.  Whatevs.  Oh, by the way, a fan gave me a very funny thing at one of my shows. 
[01:03:30]  It was a couple weeks ago.  And you didn't return the favor?  You bet I didn't.  It was the first funny thing of the evening, actually.  He gave me a copy of Zoo, that fucking horse fuck documentary.  Oh, Jesus.  And he goes, hey, Jim, I got one of the cast members to autograph it, and it had a red hoof  print on it, which I thought was very funny.  So thank you to the fan that did that.  I haven't acknowledged that, but I do have it, and it's very funny.  Some of these fans are hilarious.  Yeah, it was a fucking horse print.  There was an article about man caves last night I read it, and it's exactly what I was saying. 
[01:04:00]  Like, I would absolutely think the guy listened and wrote this article about man caves and  how they're not fucking manly, and how it's like it should be the man house and not sequestered  to a room.  And did someone tweet me yesterday that Louis C.K. has a bit on man caves or somebody? 
[01:04:30]  Does he?  Florentine did something.  No, Florentine.  Sorry.  Sorry.  And is it the same angle that...  Oh, Florentine loves them.  It's both...  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Florentine did a whole podcast on man caves.  Does he like them, or is he goofing on them?  Can we go through that and get a couple lines?  Yeah.  Is that easy enough?  I don't see.  Why not?  I'll bet you at one point...  Go through the Florentine podcast on man caves and give us a couple highlights, please.  I'll bet Jim does this at one point.  Get to get to my man caves.  Yeah.  It's my man cave, guys.  I bet he does.  Stupid man cave. 
[01:05:00]  Fucking Florentine, man.  Yeah.  Do we feature Florentine on the weekends ever?  No, we don't.  Why not?  I don't think they have a deal with him.  Ooh.  They made another deal with him where he makes five bucks a fucking week.  Righteous bucks.  We gotta get Florentine as part of that weekend programming.  He does a fine podcast.  He certainly does.  That's the end of that mystery, by the way.  I know.  That lasted a day.  Fucking pissed me off.  He was cool, by the way.  It was all me.  I was like, you gotta be fucking kidding me. 
[01:05:30]  They throw millions around for people that don't do shows or do very few shows.  Well, that's the trick.  Just for their name.  Oh, shit.  And then the guy, they sign him, and he's gonna take home five bucks a week when it's all said  and done.  Unbelievable.  Anyway, man caves.  We'll get some clips from Florentine's podcast, please.  Yeah, the person was saying, like, it's this whole, yeah, yeah, I'm a man. 
[01:06:00]  I'm going to my man cave.  And meanwhile, you're the one paying the mortgage on the entire fucking house, and now you're  relegated to one room because your wife doesn't want you and your friends messing up her living  room.  But see, a lot of our listeners have man caves.  Yeah.  I think the problem is when you start calling it a man cave.  Yes.  Like, look at this.  We're on a website right now.  This shit looks cool as fuck.  Yeah.  But I would never call it a man cave.  I'd be like, hey, let's do some of this shit in the basement. 
[01:06:30]  Dude, you can consider, like, my fucking basement a man cave.  Your whole property is a man cave, too.  Gardens in a pool.  The difference is fun.  Even the roof has fun on its feet.  I would never call it a man cave.  I think that's the problem I have with this.  It just sounds fucking, it sounds so fucking, like, like, gay.  Yeah.  Like, instead of just saying this is the bar room.  It has to be a man cave where I go to escape.  Or, no, it's, it's, you got some friends that come over and go, hey, I want to show you 
[01:07:00]  what I did with my basement.  Right, right, right.  But you would never say, I, I, I finally, I'm all in.  I got a man cave.  You want to check it out?  Because the second you call it the man cave, it means you have to go there to be a man because  the rest of your house is run by your fucking bitch wife.  That's what it means.  But look at all this shit.  Of course any guy would want this shit.  Shit, yeah.  It implies when you're not in the man cave, you are not a man.  Right.  A man is not truly a man. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, look at this.  I mean, it's.  I got a man cave.  I put, like, fucking pictures of fucking skulls.  Why?  That's pretty manly.  Chip's man cave would stink.  You think so?  Look at this.  It's like, fuck, it looks like fire.  It's got a fucking 25-inch old Zenith television set.  Fucking boom box.  Nice.  Double cassette.  Nice.  Those old, you got the lounge chairs from, like, the 70s with those nylon straps that 
[01:08:00]  are interwoven on the aluminum tubing.  Yeah, the hats with beer cup holders.  You put them on, fuck, everybody cracks up.  It's terrible.  You don't think it's fun?  No.  Just playing, like, fucking Slayer.  Oh, Chip's man cave would stink.  Yeah, there would be nothing going on.  Nothing.  Just a bowl for fucking snacks and fun.  Stale fucking Doritos.  Some kind of party mix.  Yeah, we got the fucking hate party mix.  With the fun-sized three musketeers.  Look at them from Halloween. 
[01:08:30]  You fucking grab one.  God.  Even the size says fun.  Fun size.  Eat those fucking things.  Your pecker jumps.  Party mixes suck.  It's all the.  I love doodads, though.  But it's all the shitty snacks, and they put it into one, thinking, okay, if you put all  the shitty ones together, maybe it'll be an okay snack.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm doing a fucking Seinfeld bit now, I think.  Oh, brother.  Let me say hi to Aaron in Chicago.  Good evening.  Aaron.  How's it going?  What's up?  You guys are talking about man caves, but I think yesterday you guys were mentioning 
[01:09:00]  man caves to Dan Aykroyd.  Yeah, that was me being very sarcastic.  Oh, my God.  I'm so glad you picked up on that.  Oh, my God.  Where I actually said, wow, this crystal head vodka would look great in a man cave.  It was what's called a callback.  Gotcha.  All right.  I was being extremely sarcastic, and then a few people picked up on that and tweeted  me about it.  Yeah.  Remember we were talking about the baseball brawl, and I said, you know, it would be  hilarious if the pitcher would run away? 
[01:09:30]  Run away.  We finally got one.  I want to thank Tommy Hodge.  Tommy.  On Twitter.  That's how he goes.  Tommy Hodge on Twitter.  Give him a little thank you follow.  He found one where the pitcher runs away, and it is hilarious.  We'll put this up on our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony.  So the typical...  Hold on, hold on.  He's got music.  Looks like an Asian pitcher.  Yeah.  The quality isn't the best.  Like I said, we'll put this on Facebook because we don't have a visual element.  We can see it as we're looking at it. 
[01:10:00]  And the pitcher hits the batter.  Typical shit.  And now the batter is charging the mound.  Hit it.  Oh, my God.  He's running.  He's getting chafed.  Oh, my God.  He's hauling ass.  He's hauling ass, and he just can't catch the pitch.  And he's chasing him into the outfield.  This is in Japan.  Yeah.  Here we go.  Wow.  Here you go. 
[01:10:30]  Is this a Sizer song, by the way?  Huh?  Is this Sizer song?  Yes, it is.  It's funny, guys.  And this is what the listeners are doing is just hearing this music.  They can't see anything.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  It is funny.  He finally almost gets him in the outfield.  That wasn't in Japan.  That was the Reds.  Detroit Tigers and the Reds.  Yeah, he's wearing a Cincinnati Reds fucking shirt.  Japanese always rip off the fucking American teams.  Oh.  I think those are Japanese characters. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, I didn't see.  Okay.  Wow, but they...  They do.  They use, like, fucking Yankees.  They do, huh?  Yep.  Well, why don't they come up with their own shit?  I don't know.  Oh, it's Detroit Tigers broadcaster Rod Allen.  And...  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  What?  No, it was Rod Allen was the guy's name who was probably the batter.  Right.  And I guess he was, you know, still an active player then.  Mm.  Right.  I would have stopped and just done a karate kick.  Could have pulled some fucking kung fu moves on that motherfucker. 
[01:11:30]  Mm.  That was...  Didn't work out well.  I thought we'd have an announcer fucking, you know...  Yeah.  Call the action.  Yeah.  Jimmy's right.  All they heard was fucking Chinese music or whatever the hell that was.  Whatever that was.  Speaking of which...  Yes.  Doesn't someone have a follow-up?  I want to hear it.  I want to hear it.  Oh, the Scythe song?  Yeah.  Definitely got to hear this.  I thought you wanted to hear the Jay-Z thing.  I know what that is.  Could do a little music.  Jay-Z goes to Cuba.  How the fuck did he get into Cuba?  Have they figured it out yet? 
[01:12:00]  That's a bunch of...  You're not really allowed to go to Cuba.  You could sneak in through Canada.  Yeah, there's...  If you know people.  There's a way to get there through some kind of fucking...  The Treasury Department.  You need permission to go there because there's obviously a fucking ban on travel.  And it goes back to fucking the Cold War.  Yeah, but how dare our country say that we're supposed to be free.  You can't go to Cuba?  How the fuck are you to tell me I can't go to Cuba?  Well, I think we still have a little sore spot about those nuclear missiles that fucking... 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, we talk shit.  Hey, we go to Japan and we drop them on them.  We sure did.  We're trying to straggle them.  Twice.  And they came back as a viable economic force in the world.  Much like Germany did after they got their asses kicked.  Twice in one century.  Twice by the world.  The world wanted to kick Germany's ass.  And they came back as a viable, profitable, amazing country.  I understand where you're going.  And very productive in this world. 
[01:13:00]  Even though they were crushed twice.  That's all I'll say.  Cuba...  Here's the bottom line.  There's a lot of sugar money in the U.S., I think, and things like that that don't want us.  Not a sugar!  But it sickens me that we can't go to Cuba.  And we lost that battle.  How about this?  We could not break Castro.  We could not break what they wanted to do in that country.  We could not eat green eggs and ham.  Yes!  Was Castro even alive still?  Oh, yeah.  But it's not, you know...  We just want to be a little spoiled children. 
[01:13:30]  When was the last time we saw him live?  I don't know.  He's one of those guys, when he goes down, I don't think they're going to tell anybody.  Yeah, I know.  That's true.  I think his brother's going to take over.  He said at this point that he could barely fucking lead anyway.  Yeah.  Isn't Raul leading his brother?  It's a puppet regime.  Yeah.  Literally, they have puppets running the place.  It's amazing.  Yeah, it's really a fun place to go.  Oh, no!  What are you doing?  Let's look at my shake of air poster.  Yeah, it's such a hypocritical thing because they will tell you, the powers that be, that 
[01:14:00]  it's a human rights issue, that they treat their people very poorly, and that's why we are  not going to support a government that does that.  Meanwhile, we support and send billions of dollars overseas to the likes of Egypt and  Jordan and Saudi Arabia that have horrific human rights violations.  We do business on a daily basis at an unbelievable level with China, who is known as one of the  premier horrid nations as far as human rights goes. 
[01:14:30]  But the little island off of Florida, that's the sticky wicket that we don't want to deal  with anymore.  We're holding a grudge.  We are holding a grudge.  There's no real viable reason except for the fact that, well, you know, you're the last  holdout from the old Soviet Union and, yeah, until Castro's dead and you reform, we're not  going to do business with him.  But meanwhile, we'll fucking have our troops in North Korea.  We don't mind having our troops in Cuba.  I mean, in Korea. 
[01:15:00]  Maybe next week.  Mining their fucking business.  We should pull out of there.  There's no reason for us not to be friendly with Cuba.  Zero reason.  We lost.  Tough shit.  They didn't listen to what we wanted.  The Cuban universal crisis is over.  Enough.  It's over?  Yes, it ended two weeks ago.  I couldn't believe they finally pulled those things back.  What's Korea?  It's fucked up.  Fuck them, too.  I don't care what they do in the South.  That Oon guy.  I was telling Ant during the break, and then Ant came up with something really fucking... 
[01:15:30]  Een.  But basically, he's leading this country, and he doesn't know how to fucking lead a nation.  Nothing.  He knows nothing.  Because his dad dies, it's like giving your family business to your fucking son.  But you should be training your son for the big day.  But it's so obvious he was never trained for the big day.  So obvious.  And they don't want North Korea to collapse, because that would be a complete nightmare with  people running over to South Korea, running over to China.  Look at Amy on Fallon last night. 
[01:16:00]  She looked great.  Way does she look good.  Amy looked great.  Yeah, look at that.  She's becoming a big star.  She is.  Good for Amy Schumer.  Wow.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, she's really funny.  I didn't see her on the show, but I imagine she was very funny.  Pitching her, or promoting her new show.  Yeah.  It's going to be on Comedy Central.  She isn't the picture that's picked up.  Yes, it's picked up.  I realize.  Oh.  Yeah.  Wow.  But you were saying about North Korea.  It's like a fucking real-life reality show.  This is a reality show.  You take a guy that has no experience in leadership. 
[01:16:30]  You give him an old communist country, and let him run it in front of the world.  And it's like, hey, he's got nuclear weapons.  It's a drama every day.  There's a different storyline.  He's got to interact with other countries.  It's the ultimate reality show.  It's SimCity out of control.  Right.  It's completely out of control, where you're not really taking care of the basics.  No.  That's an example of what happens in SimCity, the game, when you really don't pay attention  to the basics. 
[01:17:00]  Amazing.  Yeah.  Anyway.  Good luck.  What's going to happen next?  Do you think he's going to fire one of those fucking missiles, or what?  He's definitely going to test missiles.  He better hope that they work and go into the ocean like they normally do when they  test them, and don't take a little U-turn and hit Japan or something.  Well, I was watching the Situation Room.  Oh.  And Wolf Blitzer will make you believe it is happening any fucking second.  Yeah.  So you've got to make sure you tune into the Situation Room, because he's on it.  Get on that, then. 
[01:17:30]  They are teasing the fact that this fucking lunatic might fire missiles at any second, even  though they know it's not in any second scenario.  They raised and lowered their launchers yesterday to test them out.  And they're going to test missiles, but it's going to, you know, they're going to aim them  at the ocean.  They're going to test them falling in the ocean.  But, you know, they are taking a huge chance to test now with all this tension, because  if there is a malfunction, one of these missiles goes off course and hits anywhere besides the 
[01:18:00]  ocean, that will really look like a provocation.  And it's such a fucked up situation, because, like, China sort of has North Korea's back.  Yeah.  How strange is that?  Yeah, but not like the old days, man.  No, I understand.  Not like the Korean War days.  I understand.  China's, like, getting fed up with the whole thing.  But over the years, they absolutely had North Korea's back.  And still do, to a point.  We trade too much with China in this day and age to have China defend North Korea, who  gives them nothing, to the extent of cutting off trade with America. 
[01:18:30]  It just can't happen in this economy anymore.  China knows that.  You think someone has gotten to China and said, fucking tell them to knock it off?  Even China doesn't have that kind of pull over North Korea anymore.  Really?  They just don't have it.  Wow.  It's fucked up.  They're truly a rogue nation, apart from the whole world community.  It's not even Kim Jong-un.  I think it's the generals, the older guys.  I absolutely think Kim Jong-un is a figurehead. 
[01:19:00]  He's looked at like fucking, you know.  He's Fredo.  He's Fredo.  He's Fredo.  Yes.  And Fredo is running North Korea.  And these generals.  He's a little Carmine from fucking Sopranos.  Yeah, the Sopranos.  Saying the words wrong.  Yeah.  I was watching last night.  He was saying some shit when he's trying to act like the boss, and he's just babbling.  It's hilarious.  All right.  So now we're going to wrap all this shit up.  We got Jay-Z's song, and we got the new Psy song.  All right.  But Jay-Z sang about Cuba and why he was able to get in there, I think. 
[01:19:30]  You know what he was doing?  Huh?  Learning about Cuba.  Eating some food.  It was just a fun trip.  But is this a legit rap song now by Jay-Z?  Well, he was responding to the critics for saying he shouldn't be in Cuba, and he was  responding to the critics who were talking about him selling off his share of the Nets  so he could be a sports agent.  You know, when I was growing up, and Deep Purple had a beef with somebody, you had to  wait at least a year before they fucking put it to words. 
[01:20:00]  True.  Jay recorded it and threw it up on SoundCloud.  Yeah, these rap guys are amazing.  They had a beef, they got a brand new song tomorrow.  Yeah.  That didn't fucking happen with the bands we grew up with.  The problem with a lot of these celebrities going to Cuba on these special fucking permits  that they get and whatnot, it's almost legitimizing their government.  Now, our government is, like I said, very hypocritical.  Obviously, human rights violations all over the world, and we deal with these countries 
[01:20:30]  that are horrible people, but yet we don't deal with Cuba.  That's fine for the government.  But they're almost these liberal fucking celebrities that go down there and are treated like rock  stars by the government officials because it works as propaganda for their side, are  really doing a disservice to the people that are impoverished because their government just  takes all the money for themselves.  And they're almost legitimizing this, the regime down there, looking at the people like they're 
[01:21:00]  in a fucking zoo.  I don't think it really helps the Cuban people's cause to go down there and participate in what  amounts to propaganda.  You know they have a John Lennon park down there.  Do they?  Mm-hmm.  They have John Lennon sitting on a bench down there.  Do they?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  The regime is none of our business.  It's none of our fucking business.  It isn't any of our business.  Why are we friends with Saudi Arabia?  They throw rocks at rape victims. 
[01:21:30]  Dude, you're right.  Enough with this shit.  I am not even arguing.  Yeah.  We like the Earl they have.  There you go.  Yeah, great Earl.  There you go.  John Lennon memorial in a park in Cuba.  Doesn't even look like him.  Let me see.  Yeah, it does.  It's made of bronze or something.  Yeah, he's just sitting in the same position he was last week.  You can sit next to a frozen John Lennon, though.  That's kind of cool.  Look, see?  That person's sitting right next to a frozen John Lennon.  As far as statues go, though, it's not a great statue.  I think it's fine.  You know who was a great Cuban?  Who?  Ricky Ricardo.  Fuck. 
[01:22:00]  Baba Lou.  Fuck, yeah.  You like him?  Baba Lou, aye.  He can play the bongos.  My horse and carriage is for hire, senora.  For just as long as you desire, senorita.  We're gonna ride.  Forget the maÃ±ana and come to Havana with me.  Can we play that song?  That was his big hit.  Oh, you got it.  I love Lucy and she loves me.  We're as happy as two can be.  Yes, we may quarrel, but then we're back together again. 
[01:22:30]  You know the words to these songs.  I know the words to everything.  He was in high school when this was aired.  Does heall?  What are you doing?  Desi Liu Productions.  Babaloo.  Babaloo.  Babaloo.  Babalu.  Babaloo.  Babaloo.  Hang on, make up your fucking mind, cocksucker.  Double pineapple.  This is his big fucking...  He was a smooth motherfucker. 
[01:23:00]  That bit Eddie Murphy did on him  Was fucking perfect  I think that was in  Delirious  Where he did a bit about Ricky Ricardo  And what a smooth motherfucker he was  And he sings a little song  And puts the little hat on sideways  I forgot about that to be honest with you  Yeah I'd have to see it again  Alright here's Jay-Z addressing  Going to Cuba and selling  His share of the Nets  And in 24 hours 
[01:23:30]  Less than 24 hours  It's had almost a million listens  Wow  That's viral  I would say so  Mr. Malunajan  He's going to be a sports  Well he's officially a sports agent  He's going to be the biggest sports agent  Of course  Immediately  No he won't pass what's his name  No way  Fucking that one guy who has everyone  Scott Burroughs  He's not fucking with Scott  I don't care who he is  Scott Burroughs has A-Rod 
[01:24:00]  He has I think Jeter  He has  He's got to watch  Jay-Z's going to give him a run for his money man  Jay-Z  Depending on how much money he gets his guys  Jay-Z's way too cool  And these athletes love cool  Right  They're going to want to hang out with Jay-Z  Yeah  They love cool  You watch what happens  He is going to have a stable immediately  They love money more though  They love cools  Yeah  See what I did  Here's Jay-Z  Ladies and gentlemen  He's always epic isn't it 
[01:24:30]  God damn it  As I walk through the valley of the shadow  What  This is a fucking Casio in 1980  He did it in Cuba  How to turn Havana to Atlanta  Why I wear a shirt and bandana  Shut the fuck up  What is he saying so far  Is this supposed to be brilliant 
[01:25:00]  He turned Havana into Atlanta  Is that what he said there  That was the first line  Yeah  Property values went down  He turned Havana into Atlanta  I just don't want to understand the words  I could use my foot and  And by  You know  Travis just told me  Oh  Damn  Yeah it's terrible  Yeah I know  He's extra bad today  I really am  He's Michael Jackson bad today  He's extra bad today  And I know it  He said 
[01:25:30]  Travis just told me  Robinson Cano  You know  Is with Jay-Z now  And left  Scott Boras to go to Jay-Z  Okay that's one guy  It's already  No it's already begun  I'm telling you  Nope  Scott Boras  Scott Boras has too many  Let's bet a dollar  It's Sam Boras  I just said you were Michael Jackson bad  That's why I'm being bad  I'm being bad  He said something mean to me  Jamal  Jamal  Balling to they banners 
[01:26:00]  Getting too much bread  They try to jam you  Boy from the hood  Forgot White House  Clamers  Sorry y'all  I don't agree with y'all  Pampers  Politician never did shit for me  Except lie to me  Distort history  Wanna give me jail time  And I'm fine  Fine  Let me commit a real crime  I might buy a kilo for cheap teeth  Out of spite  I just might flood these streets  Hear the freedom in my speech  Got an onion from  Universal  We didn't weep 
[01:26:30]  Would've bought the Nets to Brooklyn for free  Except what made millions off of you fucking dweeb  I still own the building  I'm still keeping my seats  Y'all buy that bullshit  Y'all better keep your receipts  Obama said chill  You gon' get me impeached  You don't need this shit anyway  Chill with me on the beach  What does that mean?  I don't know what he's saying  What is he trying to say?  I don't think he beeped anything  Oh okay  But what is he saying?  Well there's a few things at play there  Uh huh  He was saying  First he said 
[01:27:00]  Who's he calling a dweeb?  Did he say dweeb?  He said dweeb  White people  Yeah  He said he would've brought the  Because everybody  He was referring to the people  Who were criticizing him  For leaving the Nets so quickly  Right  And he said  Well I would've brought the Nets  To Brooklyn for free  But instead all you people  That are calling me an asshole  I made millions off of you  So look at you now  He still owns the building  Before that  Does he still own the building?  Well he claims he does  I don't know if he actually owns  The Barclays  He doesn't own the building  I'm quite sure  You can't just say  You own the building 
[01:27:30]  Before that  Well I'm sorry Tim  Jay-Z only had one fifteenth  Of one percent of the Nets  Oh yeah  He never had almost any of it  He was always just like  A figurehead  Yeah he was just a little investor  I didn't realize that  A figurehead investor  They find those people  Before that he said  Put a name on it  People were saying  He should be arrested  For going to Cuba  They wanted to put him in jail for that  So he's responding by saying  Out of spite  I will get a lot of drugs  Because I still have my connections  I'll flood the streets  And flood the streets with drugs  In Havana?  No he'll come back to America 
[01:28:00]  And put drugs all over  Oh that's good  Out of spite  Well that's not nice  That's productive for his people  And his communities  Well he's not going to do it for real  He has a good voice  But I mean I just don't care about what he's saying  He sounds like every other fucking black guy rapping  No his voice  His voice sounds different  He has a different sound to his voice  They all have a little different voice  But it's that same  Like fucking  Like tough guy  Alright tough guy  Jesus  He's quite good 
[01:28:30]  He's quite good  What the fuck happens to you?  It's just a dumb goofy song  You know what's odd?  Where there's so many just dumb lies in there  What the fuck?  It's just like  He's a goofball  I know  You know what's great though?  The fucking  A fireman  Tweets dirty jokes  And it's front page news  And he's terrible  This guy hangs out with the president  And he's threatening to flood the streets with drugs  Right  And nobody says a fucking thing 
[01:29:00]  He's bragging about having White House Clarence  Well that's what the other  Which is clearance by the way  Oh  Why doesn't he say clearance probably?  I got White House Clarence  Because it doesn't rhyme with what he said before  Oh  He's got to change the words around yo  The last lyric you were asking about  He's saying he  Obama didn't want him to go to Cuba  Is what he's implying  Because Obama said  Jay  All your chicanery is going to get me impeached  Yeah that's going to do it  And then he said  Cui  Cui 
[01:29:30]  Yeah go ahead  Cui  I was just thinking of a bit  Sure  And I didn't want it to leave my brain  Can we do like the white translation of this song somehow?  Yes we could  So you know  You play the song  You stop it  And then you tell the people  What the fuck he's trying to say?  Yes we could do that  Can we do this for tomorrow?  Yeah  On Monday?  Whenever the fuck we're on next?  A very funny response  Jay Carney  The White House press secretary  Shot down that claim  About this  He goes  I guess nothing rhymes with treasury  Carney said  Because the president did not communicate with Jay-Z over this trip  Of course not  Of course not 
[01:30:00]  Jay-Z talking  Yeah that's going to get the president impeached  He's using the constitution as a fucking doormat  But it's Jay-Z that's going to do it  And I'm a business owner now  You're a business man  I am  And if you're going to come in for a fucking interview  I'm going to ask you how to say clearance  Clarence?  Clarence  If you say Clarence  I can't hire you for my business  But what he's saying is  Obama said come chill with me on the beach  As if to say  Hey look at me  I'm so close with the  Most powerful man in the free world  That he'd like to chill with me on a beach 
[01:30:30]  It's like don't sweat it  Don't sweat this impeach thing over Jay-Z  You come with Jay-Z  We'll just chill on the beach  We'll chill on the beach  President of the United States of America  What do you get if you chill on the beach with Jay-Z?  You get anything special?  Yeah  You get a better suntan lotion?  You get every fucking Republican coming after you  Imagine what the Republicans would do  If he was chilling on the beach with Jay-Z  If it was Chris Martin  During sequester  Jay-Z and Obama  I'll tell you what they'd do  They would do nothing  They would do nothing 
[01:31:00]  Because there was fucking phoning on  On this stuff too  And they're scared shitless  Let's get back to the Jay-Z song  We almost want to start a revolution  You know whenever I'm threatened  I start shooting 
[01:31:30]  Catch your body, head to Houston  I'm in queue  For a minute  When I have to hear  When I have to hear  What's going on?  When I have to hear  About the fact that  I gotta  I gotta fucking  Spin plates and juggle at the same time  Just to keep my second amendment right  And this fucking asshole  Is just  And every one of them  Rapping about fucking guns  To make it cool  Hey little boy  Get a gun  And the worst gun crime 
[01:32:00]  Is being perpetrated  In the black communities  In the inner cities  Yet I'm the problem  And legal gun owners  Are the problem  That's why  This fucking piece of shit  Can go fuck his mother  Fuck Jay-Z  What if he's talking about  Metaphorical shooting?  Nah he's not  But Jay-Z is not the problem  It's the fuck  He's just doing what he wants to do  Oh exactly  Look  I'm not saying  That he doesn't have the right  To say whatever the fuck he wants  I'm fine with that  You said he should fuck his mother though  He should fuck his mother  What did he just say about bodies there?  But  But  You can't 
[01:32:30]  Look at me  As a gun owner  A legal gun owner  And not  Look at this motherfucker  And the effect he's having  On the community  Start policing your own fucking areas  Cocksucker  What did he just say about  Guns or bodies there?  He said  You want to start a revolution?  He said something to the effect of  If you come at me  You know I'm going to start shooting  Of course he is  But he'll say he meant that verbally  Right  That's a metaphorical  But meanwhile if you show up in school  With  If you say that in a school 
[01:33:00]  That's considered a threat  You get expelled for  Of course it is  If you chew your Pop-Tart  In the shape of a gun  And point it at somebody  You get a fucking  Kicked out of school  That's all it takes  Yeah  Back to the song  We need the white translation though  We really do  Starting to get a little lost  A little lost  I'm a little lost  And I think  People are saying  He said Atlantis  Not Atlanta  Maybe  Saying I turned Cuba  Into a great family resort  Where everybody can go on vacation  I love Atlantis  That could be  This is alright  Adult pool  Adult pool

[01:53:30]  One Sirius XM.  One moment, please.  Andy, may I help you?  Yeah, let me speak to Brett Weir.  Who's calling?  Is he in?  Yeah, who's calling?  Look, jerky, I don't need to talk to you.  You don't need to talk to me?  Get Brett Weir, I said.  Hold on.  You're upstairs repairing something. 
[01:54:00]  You want me to call you back?  Well, this is the super across the way.  Yeah.  And he was supposed to take care of some business for me,  and I'm very angry at that little jerk.  All right, now I'm going to break his fucking head.  So what do you want me to do?  Get in touch with you where?  He knows what the fuck I'm talking about.  And don't have me come down there for you either, tough guy.  You tell him to see me.  Super across the street?  You got it, punk.  Okay, I'll tell him. 
[01:54:30]  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F-U-I.  Here's the latest batch of F-U's.  Fuck you.  I want to say fuck you to Bobo for fucking up my Twitter feed with his bullshit.  Anthony, can I come back on the show?  We'll raid us in such a little police.  I'll break this to the room to get through.  Fuck you.  This F-U goes after my boss, Jelly Kits McGillicuddy,  calling me an obstructionist, stopping the project, blah, blah, blah.  Fuck you.  I want to say a fuck you to my government and to my boss. 
[01:55:00]  You want to raise my taxes, raise my insurance, but don't give me a raise.  And then tell me I'm going to do one harder.  Fuck you.  I'm going on welfare.  Fuck you.  What the heck?  Who the heck?  Just give me my lunch, pal.  Who the heck needs it?  Fuck you, regular Joe.  Fuck you.  Yeah, this F-U goes after Joe DeRosa, quit coming on the show.  You're a bore, and your comedy fucking sucks.  Fuck you, Joe DeRosa.  Fuck you. 
[01:55:30]  Hey, Sam.  That was a great little fit, bringing Fandango in the studio.  I bet you and E-Rock were standing there with just fucking rock hard hard on,  just sitting there supporting a big old tent in your pants,  because there was a wrestler in the studio.  Go fuck yourself.  Fuck you.  Hey, slobbo, drunk fucking dude in either.  Fuck you, Kevin Pollack.  Fuck you.  Call the Opie and Anthony F-U line.  866-SU-LINE-1. 
[01:56:00]  That's 866-SU-LINE-1.  Now, the Opie and Anthony Show continues.  What's this? 
[01:56:30]  It's Jamie's Crying riff.  All week.  Now to five for my money.  Oh, yeah.  It's on the weekend cubs.  That's the Jamie's Crying little drum thing.  Rolling down the street.  I saw this girl machine was pumping.  I waked my eyes, got into the rye, went to a club who was jumping.  The Negro.  Nice.  You're a liar. 
[01:57:00]  I said, I got it going on, baby doll.  And I'm a liar.  In person.  She said, you're the king.  I said, be my queen, if you know what I mean.  Let's do the wild fangs.  Kay.  Kay.  Wild fangs.  Kay.  All right.  We got David Tell coming in, in a little bit.  Wild time.  I really want to interview Carol Burnett, man.  I love her.  But she's afraid of the show.  I understand why. 
[01:57:30]  Is she really afraid of the show?  Yeah.  She is.  You know, again, her era is much different.  The role I tried to talk to her is, oh, I would play with this book is, you know.  She doesn't know, man.  She just knows her reputation.  Maybe she should listen to our Dan Aykroyd interview or our Paul Anka interview.  We'd give her a great interview.  We're good with the old timers.  You could never fuck with Carol.  Like, as a comic, you could never fuck with Carol Burnett.  I would never fuck Carol Burnett.  Who would?  Yes.  Oh, what?  Who would be shitty to her, though?  She's a fucking legend.  She's such a contributor. 
[01:58:00]  She's fucking hilarious.  The Carol Burnett show was fucking brilliant.  I really love her.  She's such a fucking contributor, and she put in so many funny fucking hours on TV when  it was hard.  67 to like 75 or something, like really not easy.  When they didn't let the woman, you know, succeed.  And when you had to fucking...  It was her and I Love Lucy.  That was it.  You had to write.  Yeah.  I mean, think of the fucking writing that went on.  Is she a good stand-up?  I don't know if she was a stand-up. 
[01:58:30]  Interesting.  I always thought she was a sketch comic or an actress.  I never thought I'd ever say.  I wonder if she ever did.  But she would do that thing at the end where she would talk to the audience and that dumb  Tarzan call.  Q and A.  But imagine just doing that and just talking to the audience.  And what was such a weird shot back then for Carol Burnett is when you'd see the studio  audience lit up, it looked so weird, the break of that reality, like that reality.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Can we look for a studio audience shot, Sam?  When Carol Burnett talks to the audience, it'll be in color. 
[01:59:00]  And then you realize like all those people just...  They're dead.  They all died of cancer before fucking Lennon was shot.  But like when you see that weird...  How old is she?  Oh, she's got to be in her 70s.  What's this?  Oh.  Let's see.  What the fuck is that?  What are they asking her?  The girl is old enough to be my mother.  Sit down, Danny. 
[01:59:30]  Look at that.  Do you remember your first kiss?  My first kiss?  Yes, I do.  Did you like it?  Well, it was from a dog.  Fucking hilarious, Carol.  What's the...  Are you going to be on the...  Peanut butter on you?  Uh, yes, unless...  Yes, unless you know something I don't.  Would you be earlier or later or less?  What, dear?  Sometimes I fall asleep.  Sometimes you fall asleep during our show.  Is this a repeat show? 
[02:00:00]  Is this a repeat show?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Did somebody ask...  Wow.  You still get stage fright before you come out on stage.  Once in a while.  That's Richard Jones.  And then when I do, my hair gets just like yours.  All right.  Got a big afro.  Yes, ma'am.  There you go.  I think you'd like to live in Washington, D.C.  She's so dead.  Now, just between us, and I don't want to make anyone mad,  and I know this show doesn't stop at the California borders, 
[02:00:30]  but I can't...  Yes.  I can't understand anyone who'd want to live anyplace but in California.  Oh, boy.  I'd like to sing a song for the little lady from New York.  You're a maud.  You want to sing, too?  Oh, come on.  Bring in an audience, come it up.  How much fun is this show, though?  Yeah.  Just fun.  These are all different episodes, by the way,  that they're cutting from.  How much fun is this?  Terry McCann. 
[02:01:00]  That woman is dressed like Maude.  You made me love you in the key of G.  She looks just like Maude.  Oh, shit.  Well, he's taking over the show.  You made me love you.  And they're all ugly.  Yes.  They are horrendous.  I didn't want to do it.  I didn't want to do it.  I didn't want to do it.  I didn't want to do it.  I didn't want to do it.  I didn't want to do it.  You made me want to do it. 
[02:01:30]  It's just an audience member.  She's belting it on a floor.  No lawyers.  I guess you always knew it.  You made me happy sometimes.  You made me glad.  But there were times...  Where is that woman now?  She's a lot thinner now. 
[02:02:00]  There's no extra skin on her.  Oh, God bless her.  Yeah.  That hair looks the same, too.  Looking a bottle of fucking Dan Aykroyd's vodka with that wig on.  How great is that?  How much...  The laughs coming out of that were fucking massive laughs.  Obviously, she would just fool around with the audience, and then they would get a few minutes.  Take the best ones.  Yeah.  But still, holy fuck.  Man, Carol was great.  No, I just see Ellen DeGeneres. 
[02:02:30]  She's so much better than Ellen.  But, I mean, you see the fucking cadence that Ellen DeGeneres has now.  Yeah.  Carol Burnett had to be a huge influence on Ellen DeGeneres.  Yeah, I betcha.  David Tell is walking down the hall.  Jeez.  We also got clips from Florentine's podcast on man caves.  You want to take a quick listen, or what?  Definitely.  Yeah?  All right.  We were talking about man caves earlier.  Jeez, that guy's amazing.  What, what, what?  What a fucking guy with that plane.  Oh, here it is.  You were talking about this earlier.  This guy does a great job. 
[02:03:00]  Look, the propeller didn't even get bent.  Was he Sully?  Wow, those guys are so fucked up.  He probably fucking loved it.  Yeah, yeah.  He probably loved it.  He was great, man.  He was able to do that.  Yeah, see what I did.  Also, oh, okay.  The Detroit Lions signed that kicker that we talked about a few months back.  Oh, that's kicking the basketballs into the fucking hoops.  Yeah, remember the, uh, the, remember the viral, the, the kicker?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  With a whole bunch of different kicks he did?  The Lions are giving him a shot.  He said, fuck it.  David Tell, what's up, buddy? 
[02:03:30]  Hey, guys.  Thanks for having me in.  Of course.  Thank you for fucking wanting to do our show.  Wow.  All right.  You know?  I missed the whole Cal Burnett thing.  I didn't know you guys were, you know.  Huge fans of Cal Burnett.  We love her.  Is that what you call it?  Yeah.  Is that what you call it?  Yeah, no, she's great.  I was just, Harvey Korman, what do you think?  Well, he's not, he's been quiet as of late.  Yeah, I know, but I mean, I always felt like he was, he, I think he was one of the people  who, uh, he was like a serious actor or something like that.  He was always like putting down Tim Conway and all the rest of them.  Yeah.  He always was threatening to walk off. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, he was very difficult, Harvey, they said.  And they, they, well, they, the three of them, uh, Carol Burnett, Vicki Lawrence and  Tim Conway were here not too long ago.  Oh.  And they did a Q&A and they talked about Harvey being difficult and threatening to walk  off.  He was for real difficult?  Oh, yeah.  But I mean, whatever, it worked out.  Tim Conway was hilarious.  But he wasn't there in the beginning.  Tim, a lot of these guys came along later.  He was on for a bit.  He was like the Bill Murray.  They brought him in when they were a hit.  A little later.  For the second season. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  I missed all the good chat.  Yeah.  North Korea.  You guys talking about that?  Yeah.  Not really.  A little bit.  What's your take on that whole thing?  I don't know.  I kind of, I know it's not probably the cool take, but I kind of see his side.  I mean, I was a fat kid growing up with a girl's first name and he's the fat, he definitely  is the fattest guy in the country.  No kidding.  I mean, that's got to be horrible, you know.  You can't have a fat leader when you're starving.  Yeah.  People are starving.  How does he feel about him? 
[02:05:00]  So with that lesbian haircut?  He looks goofy doing everything, too.  And they're trying to make him a tough guy, you know, showing him shooting.  They shoot off a missile and they show him with the binoculars looking at it.  Right, right.  And he just looks like the goofy little fat kid.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like someone brought their kid to work.  Yeah.  You know how we do, which is someone's name over there.  Looking for a way to say that.  Sorry.  All right.  That was hacky. 
[02:05:30]  No one wanted to.  You don't think so?  No.  A little bit.  Let the missiles fly.  That's what I'd say.  That's got to suck if you live in Guam, which is like the Puerto Rico of the Pacific.  Have you ever pulled an R&R in Guam?  Anybody here?  I'm sure your dad has a story or two about good old Guam.  No, no.  He spent the entire Vietnam War in Canada.  My brother lived in Guam for a while.  See?  My marine biologist brother.  He loved it.  Did it capsize?  It didn't capsize. 
[02:06:00]  You've heard that clip, right?  David Tell?  No.  The famous clip?  Oh, we've got to play for David Tell.  What is it?  We have to play this for David Tell.  I don't even want to tell you what it is.  It's a real clip.  Let's see it.  Of a, I guess, a congressional hearing or whatever?  Yes.  This is always fun.  This is one of the best clips.  This is always fun.  We're talking about Guam.  This one is fun.  You talk to a general about Guam and building on one side of the island or the other.  All right.  Oh, wow.  Come on.  Hank, okay.  I better not be goofy music over this.  No.  Listen to this guy. 
[02:06:30]  Come on, sir.  And he's dead.  You're talking to a general or something or an admiral?  Yes.  Hank Johnson.  Hank Johnson.  Thank you.  Dumb cunt.  Widest level is what?  No.  Gotta go back.  Gotta go back.  Who's that guy?  Number 43?  Is there a better version?  Yeah.  Get this fucking version.  I know, Sam.  You're wrecking everything.  They're putting subtitles in.  Stop spurling it.  This is an island that at its widest level is, what, 12 miles from shore to shore. 
[02:07:00]  And at its smallest level or smallest location, it's seven miles between one shore and the other.  It's a congressman.  Is that correct?  Yeah.  I don't have the exact dimensions, but to your point, sir, I think Guam is a small island.  It's a very small island and about 24 miles, if I recall, long. 
[02:07:30]  So 24 miles long, about seven miles wide at the least widest place on the island and about 20, about 12 miles wide on the widest part of the island.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  I don't know how many square miles that is.  Wait for the punchline, Dave. 
[02:08:00]  Wait for this.  I don't have that figure with me, sir.  I can certainly supply it to you if you'd like.  Yeah, my fear is that...  Pause.  The general should have said, will you get to your fucking point?  Yeah, what's your fucking point?  We get it.  You're trying to say this island's a little small.  Yeah.  It's a small, long, thin island.  But this admiral or general is just dealing with a congressman the way that these dummies are dealt with.  Yes.  Being polite to them.  Right.  You know.  There's no reason to be polite to this guy.  What a dumb motherfucker Hank Johnson is.  You're about to hear...  What state is he from? 
[02:08:30]  I don't know.  But you're about to hear one of the stupidest men alive.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  This is brilliant.  This is just a setup.  Hold on to your hats, kids.  Here it comes.  The setup is extremely long, I know, but it's worth it.  The payoff is worth it.  Do you, if you'd like?  Yeah, my fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over and capsize.  Uh, we don't anticipate that the, uh... 
[02:09:00]  But he's got an answer like it's a little shitting me.  That's a congressman.  Did they ask him what he meant by that?  I mean...  But they all just, no, believe me, they were all thinking one thing.  He thinks you build too much shit on there, it's going to get heavy, and the fucking thing's going to capsize.  Those islands are just floating around in the ocean.  He's a congressman.  I kind of see Hank Johnson's point.  Do you?  Yeah.  Keep going.  No, I think, uh, you know, it sucks because the Admiral, he has to kind of, you know, I guess they can, can they get fired, like, by the congressional people? 
[02:09:30]  I mean...  No, they've got to be fucking voted out unless they're deemed incompetent, but I think the whole procedure to do that is impossible.  He's still in the House of Representatives.  Oh, my God.  The incumbent, and he came into office 2007.  Proceeded by, of course, Cynthia McKinney, that fucking twat.  Oh, that fucking dumb piece of shit.  What a shit district this is. 
[02:10:00]  Wow.  And, uh, this dummy followed Cynthia McKinney.  And he's still in.  Who is really a fucking horrible one.  You know why?  Because his constituency will vote in based on nothing but the color of someone's skin.  But if you think an island could fucking...  Because he's black.  Well, no one white's running for that one.  If you think an island can sink, someone's got to fucking say, look...  That's why everyone voting for him probably thinks the same fucking thing.  Oh, my God.  All right, let me...  They're dunces.  So how does it end up?  I mean, like, what happens?  You've got to hear.  Yeah.  Well, ironically enough, the island actually did tip over.  Yes.  So...  And then...  So, ha-ha.  The general had to apologize for screaming the N-bomb all the way out. 
[02:10:30]  Guam population, I think, currently about 175,000.  And, again, with 8,000 Marines and their families, it's an addition of about 25,000 more into the population.  And also things like the environment.  He's definitely getting over his head.  The sustitutes.  Wow.  This is the guy making decisions.  Yeah, it's infuriating. 
[02:11:00]  Why is this fucking dumb motherfucker making decisions?  Everyone went to lunch or something, and he's just kind of like, you know, you just ask a couple of questions, we'll be back.  Yeah, yeah, we'll be right back.  Hold down the fort, don't talk.  And then he decides to, you know, talk.  Wow.  The two areas of the environment, coral reefs and those kinds of things.  And I know that, you know, lots of people don't like to think about that, but, you know, we didn't think about global warming either.  And now we do have to think about it. 
[02:11:30]  And so I'm concerned from an environmental standpoint whether or not Guam is the best place to do this relocation, but it's actually the only place.  Is that correct?  This is the best place.  This is the farthest west U.S. territory that we own.  And, you know, this is part of our nation.  Yeah.  And in readdressing the forward presence and posture importance to Pacific Command, Guam is a vital to this decision. 
[02:12:00]  This guy has to address him.  This idiot.  The other guy was laughing.  Of course they were laughing.  How?  That's great.  How does he run for office and get reelected unless the voting public are fucking morons?  He had that great preacher voice, you know, like, kind of, ah, you know, very comforting.  It was good.  What if somebody straps a motor on Guam and drives it away in the night and you wake up and you ain't there no more? 
[02:12:30]  Well, sir, it's very hard to propel a large island through the ocean, sir, to a completely different location, sir.  Okay, what happens if someone's digging a hole for, like, a building and the islands spring a leak and sink? 
[02:13:00]  Yeah, sir, that can't happen either.  Let's see.  The island is actually connected to the earth.  It's virtually a mountain where most of it is under the water and just the top is poking out.  No, you sound ridiculous.  There's a mountain in the ocean.  That's crazy.  There's self-control on the guy.  You would have to yell at him.  Holy mother of fuck. 
[02:13:30]  There's self-control.  And how far away is that guy from being president, like if there was some kind of asteroid hit or something?  Way closer than us.  Yes, closer than us.  That's all we have to know.  I know one thing.  I'm way smarter than that fuck.  I know.  Global warming.  That's not true.  No.  He's trying to go for the thing, like, you know, the liberal thing here.  Global warming.  We didn't think we have to think about that.  And now we got to think about the global warming.  You know, UFOs and the Loch Ness Monster. 
[02:14:00]  We didn't think.  But now we got to deal with that.  The tooth fairy.  That is dummy.  I'm amazed he's still in office.  I'm amazed he's not working at the Comedy Cellar.  I mean, really.  He would fit right in.  He's got a good style.  He does.  Good delivery.  I like that.  Yeah.  Hank.  What else is on your radar there, Dave Attell?  Well, I guess for the fans of Dave's All Porn, there's no new season.  What?  It's kind of sad. 
[02:14:30]  The network said that it wasn't about ratings.  It wasn't about content.  It was about programming.  We're going to run all the first season one and two over and over for the next two years or so.  Two years.  Wait, what do they mean it's about programming?  They didn't have room for it?  No, no.  They figure it's kind of like one of those shows where, like, you know, it's evergreen.  They can.  Oh, boy.  And I'm doing a Hank Johnson here.  Well.  No.  So it was like, you know, one of those things where that's what they told me.  I don't know if it's true or not. 
[02:15:00]  But ratings-wise, it was good.  And we got a lot of great feedback from the people.  Dave, if I could ask you a question, Dave.  I was watching your show.  It capsized.  How do you fit inside the television?  Because I see you're a larger man, and you look when I watch you on the show.  Hank Johnson's adult.  Sir.  That makes you happy, too, right?  Oh, it makes me ecstatic.  I'm glad the Admiral didn't show up with his saucy parrot. 
[02:15:30]  He would have had these unkind words.  Oh, no new season of Dave's old porn.  Yeah.  That does suck.  And you know what I'm trying to do?  I have so many great clips, you know, that we haven't shown.  And, like, today, we're putting up another episode of the My First Porn Stories, which  Jim did one.  It's his episode.  His clip today is on the Dave's old porn.com.  Oh, cool.  What's the gist of that?  What do you do?  Well, I just asked everybody about their first, like, time they ever saw porn, you know?  That's fucking cool. 
[02:16:00]  It's not a particularly new idea, but everybody has some...  You know, it's really interesting.  All comics, we all have, like, a sad first porn story.  Yeah.  And everybody, like, Jim's was pretty incredibly weird and good, but weird, you know?  I don't remember it.  I mean, was it with the mutton chops when I saw the porn picture?  How long is the clip?  Could we play it here?  It was, um...  Huh?  Could we play it?  Yeah, you can play it.  Go ahead.  Do you mind?  No, I love it.  All right.  Here's Jim talking about his first time watching porn.  And Dave.  And Dave, of course.  Guys, I just interjected nothing. 
[02:16:30]  The first porn I ever saw was my friend Raja.  He's an Indian kid.  And his father had one of those top-load VCRs.  And we watched The Fur Trap with Kelly Mint and Herschel.  It was an awful movie.  But there was a lesbian seduction scene where she's like, oh, I don't know if we should  be doing this.  It affected me so much.  I actually just went into his parents' bathroom and I laid on the floor and I jerked off with  my head on the floor by his father's toilet.  Wow.  That's my first porn experience.  That is so similar to my first drinking experience.  That's funny. 
[02:17:00]  It was no congressional hearing, but Jimmy brought it.  It was a great story.  That's the movie.  I was thinking about the first porn pictures I ever saw.  I had mutton chops with him.  But yeah, I remember that.  I still remember that movie.  I remember the smell of his parents' bedroom.  It wasn't a bad smell.  It was just, that moment changed my life.  I remember being so smitten with lust at the seduction of this woman seducing the other  one.  I don't know if we are actually seeing a cock be sucked by a girl. 
[02:17:30]  It blows your mind.  It really does.  You would only imagine that or seeing one in your own face.  To see a girl doing that, it was, I was, I could not wrap my head around how amazing  this was.  And I had to go jerk off on his parents' fucking bathroom floor.  Wow.  And then do you remember the next time, it probably was years later, the next time you  saw porn.  The next thing I knew, I came out of a blackout and I was 35.  I had intimacy issues.  I had a morgue as a kid.  Yeah, I came out of a blackout with fucking a bunch of destroyed relationships and a path 
[02:18:00]  of human wreckage behind me.  That's weird.  We had found a super eight millimeter film and didn't have a projector to watch it on.  And it was an old, you know, stag film.  And had to go to my high school and try to talk the AV guy into lending us a projector  to take to my buddy's house who was like a block away from the high school.  And we did that, loaded it up and actually saw, yeah, and actually saw moving fucking 
[02:18:30]  porn.  Yeah, he'd seen magazines and shit like that.  But like you said, when it's moving pictures, porn for the first time, it fucking, all kinds  of glands inside you start shooting fluid that never came out before.  Yeah, you didn't realize what your body was capable of.  Oh, it's crazy.  And you're always with another dude usually for the first time video.  But magazines is like the first, you know, alone in your own world.  Yeah, yeah.  Can you find Sam?  Can you look up Fur Trap with Kelly Mint? 
[02:19:00]  And I think we got to find the scene that was Jamie Gillis in that.  Set you on your way.  Or no, it wasn't.  It might have been.  He's I think he's doing stand up now.  Who's the porn guy doing stand up?  Herschel Savage.  I think Herschel Savage.  Herschel was just in a theatrical stage play of Deep Throat.  Something like that.  Really?  With Hank Johnson?  Yes.  I remember being at my friend Frank's house.  Oh, Frank was better?  Oh, Frank was better.  And there was a bunch of guys hanging out.  And he had a VCR downstairs in his man room.  We were 15 years old or whatever. 
[02:19:30]  He had all these weights and shit.  We'd all hang out there, hit the heavy bag.  And they were all going to swim upstairs in Frank's pool.  And I remember watching this Swedish erotica porn.  And Ron Jeremy's in the scene.  And these two girls suck his dick.  And the one girl, it's like home video.  And the one girl has braces and her fucking juicy lips sucking his cock.  And then the scene before it, again, I was so...  Braces on her legs?  Yeah.  Yes.  She had polio.  She was really weird.  And she fell out of her chair. 
[02:20:00]  And he fucked her face while the family banged on the door.  There was a...  I wonder what happened to Raja.  I talked to him the other day.  He's in a Kiss cover band.  He's a buddy of mine.  Oh, really?  He's still a friend of mine.  Yeah, he's a guy I like.  Wow.  He's a Gene Simmons fanatic.  Oh, if I saw Gene at the roast, and I promised him that I would...  I promised Raja I would show Gene a picture of Raja and his makeup.  And I just...  He's one of my oldest friends.  Uh-oh.  So I'm fucking following Gene.  And he said hi to me, but he was walking quick because people were mobbing him.  And he was being nice to me. 
[02:20:30]  Uh-huh.  But I showed him the fucking...  The picture.  That's great.  I'm gonna charge him a piece to actually do the music.  Fucking cocksucker.  Did you find it?  No, he was nice.  Oh, my God.  That was good.  Oh, is this the scene?  You've seen this film?  Yeah.  This is a loop.  That looks like a young Sandy Kane.  Wait, is this the scene?  It does.  It does, right?  Yeah, she's killing a dinosaur.  She's old.  Wow, that's a nice bush.  Oh, my God.  That's a massive bush.  That's great.  I swear to God, I thought you had panties on. 
[02:21:00]  I thought you had panties.  It's all the way to the hips.  It's all the way to the hips.  It's all the way to the hips.  It's all the way to the steakhouse.  Pause.  Pause.  Is it even possible for a girl to grow like that anymore?  I don't think it is.  I think genetically women have changed where they can't even grow a bush that thing anymore.  Not to that point.  There's no way.  It goes all the way to the hip bones.  How could she wear pants?  I mean, it's like a choice.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  I'll tell you what.  That's what it was like when I was young.  Oh, yeah, Joe.  Oh, you get in there, you park it to drive it out.  What the heck?  You guys talk dirty.  What do I need?  You get me a container of coffee, I'm happy.  I don't watch this gunk. 
[02:21:30]  Dave, you like a hairy bush or what?  Not that hairy.  I mean, that's a little rough, right?  Wow, that's too much.  Is that too much?  That's definitely like, you know, Woodstock, you know, whatever.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They used to call it the 70s Earth Mama.  Earth Mama.  Maybe now my dad will, you know, understand.  It was part of growing up, though, having to do that little fucking thing with your fingers,  like fucking Artie Johnson and laughing.  Very intense. 
[02:22:00]  That's for the older demo.  I know.  They're out there.  They're appreciating it.  Oh, yeah.  No, the scene I'm thinking of is they were wearing fur coats.  They worked at like a factory of fur coats.  She's wearing fur panties.  I want to see more of this huge money, though.  Fucking Hudson Perry.  Push play.  Push play.  Push play.  Push play.  Push play.  Push play.  But that's like, wow.  Yeah, that's too much.  It would be cool if, like, she never shaved since, like, ever.  Right.  And imagine how it is now, like, beyond ZZ Top, through the Al Jazeera.  That is, but that's a situation where you just don't shave at all. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  That's been growing for years.  That's a choice.  Let's push play.  I want to see what fucking happens in this scene.  Just her standing up where it looks like she has black panties on.  She's squeezing her own breast.  Oh, no, she looks alarmed.  Uh-oh.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Look at that bush.  It's...  That's just half bush, and it's still a lot.  Yeah.  And it's also going down the legs.  It goes right up her asshole to the back of her head.  Oh.  It's terrible.  It ends on Ron Jeremy's back. 
[02:23:00]  Two movies over.  Oh, look at her.  Wow.  She's hot, though, man.  Look at her.  Yeah, she's a nice fucking...  She's so turdy.  She looks so fucking...  Heavy tits.  ...very dirty girl.  Good music.  I love the music, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who is this actress?  Because she doesn't ring a bell to me.  Oh, I see.  I don't know.  Harry Cunt McGillicuddy.  Oh, wow.  This is like...  I don't know.  Wow.  Look at her spitting long nipples.  Aren't they great?  Those areolas?  I would suckle them. 
[02:23:30]  This sounds like driving music from Canon.  Yeah.  He's driving through fucking Studio City.  This is great.  It looks like she has one leg with just like, whatever that is, a roadkill in her lap.  Like she's gonna do some taxidermy.  Yeah.  Oh, what happened there?  I don't know.  Oh, man.  She's standing up.  Yes.  Ooh.  Oh, wow.  She has a Russian hat in her lap.  She is.  I love that look.  Look at that.  Yeah, but her pussy's...  Oh, my God. 
[02:24:00]  Look how high up that pussy is.  The pussy hair goes.  Yeah.  Jesus, it's a mohawk.  This is not the fur trap.  Crazy.  Huh?  It's not the fur trap?  No.  Zip through, Sam.  You're going too slow.  Zip through.  This is craziness, that bush.  This is terrible.  Yeah, we'll be cool if we can find the actual part of the scene where you, you know...  This is not it.  It's not even the movie.  This girl...  This is the girl from...  This is the tub lady from The Shining.  Oh, good.  Oh, good.  She's doing a groovy dance.  She's doing a pussy dance.  Yeah.  She looks like the sniper from Full Metal Jacket. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  It's funny.  Oh, shit.  Oh, let's go side of the back.  It's good music.  Wait, let's see what their bushes look like.  They're really hot, too.  Look at that one.  Show that cunt.  Look how big their panties are.  They're giant panties.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Just feeling her tit.  Yeah.  They really are.  Exploratory kiss.  It's such slow motion fucking...  What year is this again?  Touching.  Look at those giant panties.  Oh, look at that.  Wow.  Oh, those are great panties.  She's wearing diapers. 
[02:25:00]  I love that.  They're horrible.  They're incontinent women.  Uh-oh.  There is nothing sexy about those panties.  This is a porn called Women with Bladder Cancer.  And they have giant diapers on.  Oh, what's going on?  This is crazy.  They look so stoned, too.  Don't they?  They probably are.  Like, really?  It's like the orgy scene from Faces of Death.  It's really sexy.  My favorite part so far is the couch behind them.  Yeah, that is a good one.  Yeah.  It's going to be on Scorch's set next week. 
[02:25:30]  Awesome.  Spotted fucking couch has rosacea.  You want to fast boat a little?  Come on, Sam.  You're picking the worst part.  And get to, um...  I just want to see what they look like without these giant panties on.  Yeah, I want to see those chicks.  Let's see those hairy cunts.  Yeah, Chip.  That broad's still dancing.  Yeah, it's all fun.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, look at that.  She's squeezing those ass cheeks nicely.  That's a lot.  Oh, this is great.  A lot of darkness in there.  I love this.  Girls standing up.  Wow.  Clumsy movements. 
[02:26:00]  You know that girl's dancing like the old man in Cuckoo's Nest?  When Nicholson's trying to get him to vote?  Put your hand up.  You want to watch the ball game with your hairy cunt?  This is quite a night at the junior college.  Oh, they're going to do some scissoring.  Look at the bush on that...  No, they're like hiding from that bush.  Like a tornado.  They're just dry-humping sloppily.  This chick is doing like an acid dance.  Yeah.  Is this that show Girls?  No, she's dancing like that girl in Midnight Cowboy. 
[02:26:30]  Maybe that crazy girl in the diner who was putting the fucking kid's toy in her face.  No.  No.  I'm not recalling that scene.  All right.  Find the fur trap.  This is fucking not what I wanted.  No.  Sam.  It sucks when one girl's on coke and the other two girls are on lids.  Damn.  It really does.  Damn.  They didn't part it right.  That riff sounds like another song.  Don't go to X-Hampster.  Go to Google.  Google.  Yeah.  Google.  Hocus Pocus by Focus.  I think that's what that riff sounded like.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Very good.  But anyway, Jim, thanks for volunteering your porn story. 
[02:27:00]  That was good.  Of course, man.  I enjoyed doing that show.  I was much fatter.  I wish it was still going because I'd love to have the new thin neck going on.  You've come up a bit.  Well, you know.  Hey, it's summer, right?  Summer is fucking...  Jim was at Caroline's this weekend, too.  Oh, really?  Oh, just hitting home runs.  We got to push the Sunday show.  Sunday show.  Sunday show.  Yeah, weekend's sold out.  It's got to be sold out by now, no?  Friday, Saturday is...  The Sunday probably has tickets.  Oh, great.  That's the one I'm going to.  Is it Hitler's birthday?  That's next week.  420, right?  Yep. 
[02:27:30]  420.  Hitler's birthday.  Mm-mm-mm.  Happy birthday.  To you.  To you.  But it's when...  What's his name again?  Kim...  Kim Jong-un.  The great-grandpa, whatever his name was.  Yes.  Whoever.  It's his birthday.  That's when they're supposedly going to watch.  And he turns 100.  If he was still alive.  It's his 100th birthday, so it's a big...  Everything's going on.  That's a big day for all the fucking tyrants emerging.  But I also think the anniversary of the first rush hour is coming out. 
[02:28:00]  That might be a big deal of it, too.  Oh, that could do it, too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I'm sorry.  I'm having a crazy move myself.  I'm going out to Jersey this weekend, hitting the Stress Factory.  Bregard.  I'm a little excited.  This weekend?  Yeah.  Nice.  David Tell.  You know, I'm going to get a pork roll.  Is it called the Stress Factory?  Yeah.  It's called Vinnie Brand's Stress Factory.  Or is it called Vinnie Brand's Stress Factory? 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, I'm going to throw a ball at a player and call him a...  He put his name on the building there, David Tell, since the last time you're there.  Wow.  Vinnie's Club is great.  It's Vinnie Brand's Stress Factory.  Yes.  No, sorry about that.  Yeah, how many comedy shows have you guys been talked into going to?  Because every one of Norton's shows, I could see you guys.  Like the casino shows, I could see.  Oh, yeah.  But then there's got to be all those other shows that you're like, oh, all right, I guess  I'll have to go.  Wow.  Oh, good.  I like when Jimmy's at Caroline's.  That's a nice, easy fucking...  That's a great one.  I'm like a couple of blocks away from the place anyway. 
[02:29:00]  It's great.  Here it is.  Can you remember the first time you played at Caroline's?  That'll be my next project.  I can kind of remember.  You know, I said to myself, you're on Broadway.  Ah.  The crossroads of the world.  Yeah.  It's great, because once you get one joke about, like, Jersey Boys, you can use it every time  you work there.  Absolutely.  I'm opening up with...  Huh?  I'm opening up with, hey, remember Cats used to be at the Winter Garden Theater?  They said, now and forever.  Apparently not.  Fucking place explodes. 
[02:29:30]  Kills every time, right?  And then someone from the back goes, Mama Mia's there now.  And then what would you say?  Mama Mia's there now.  Oh, yeah?  I hear she's very ill.  I hear she's having a problem with her ovaries.  It's not funny.  My mother has cancer.  Your mother is one.  Caroline's a class club.  It's great.  It really is.  It's top of the line.  And that goddamn Greg Charles.  Greg is a good man.  I go in there, I fucking, I don't pay for anything. 
[02:30:00]  He hooks us up.  It's amazing.  I take what I would have paid for my drinks and everything, and I give it to the fucking  waiter or waitress.  And I say, keep coming back.  And boy, do they ever.  It's my little gimmick to keep drinking at an alarming rate.  Wait a second.  I got a joke before we go.  What's red and, wait.  Wait.  Hold on.  It's fucking, like, what's black and white and red all over? 
[02:30:30]  What?  Fucking newspaper.  Mooey, mooey, mooey, mooey.  Moo.  Mooey, mooey, mooey, mooey.  Moo.  Mooey, mooey, mooey, mooey.  Moo.  I'm a big, fat fucking guy.  Moo. 
[02:31:00]  This is the Opie Anthony Channel.  On Sirius XM.  Little 12-ounce goddamn roll of salt is supposed to feed your brother and me.  And you, 600 pounds of men, at least.  You get my point?  And the two girls, and they put it in that fucking pussy roll of sausage.  Son of a bitch.  Somebody needs their ass kicked.  Some little consumer geek-a-royd.  Fuck this shit up.  Save money.  Save money.  Save money.  Yeah.  Save money. 
[02:31:30]  Save money.  Save money.  Fuck.  I'm going to eat, goddammit.  Randy Taylor.  I don't know where you people come from.  I don't know if you test your products, your quantity of your product.  Your products are very delicious.  Love your sausage for 30-something years.  But I can't take and feed a family of five on a little 12-ounce roll of sausage.  I don't mind paying you more money for your 16-ounce roll of sausage.  But you don't have it anymore.  You've got a 12-ounce roll.  And you've got three men that weigh over 200 pounds apiece, a woman that's a little plump 
[02:32:00]  Scotch girl, and a daughter who's 13.  And you're going to try to take a 12-ounce roll of sausage and a couple of dozen eggs  and feed that.  It ain't going to work.  And I'm not going to purchase your product anymore or ever again.  And as far as your 16-ounce of maple and sage, I don't eat that.  I'm not from the north.  I'm a Texas man.  Jimmy Dean sausage is for southern people to eat with the breakfast with the fried eggs 
[02:32:30]  and the T-bone steaks.  And I can't see going to a little 12-ounce package to feed four, five, six people.  And I'm not going to buy two of those 12-ounce packages just because you want to downsize  and charge the same goddamn price.  I'd sure like a reply.  And I'd sure like you to go back to your 16-ounce package on your regular sausage  because I'm not going to buy it otherwise ever again.  I'll just have my own damn sausage made like I used to 30-something years ago. 
[02:33:00]  It's not as tasty as yours is, but it'll work.  Goodbye.  See, told you we had sponsors.  And now back to the O.P. Anthony Show.  David Tell in studio playing the Stress Factory this weekend in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  That helped.  And then you got Jim Norton at Caroline's sold-out show Sunday. 
[02:33:30]  You can go Sunday still.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-1-100.  There might be tickets on the Late Show tonight.  I'm not sure.  I know the early show and both shows Saturday sold out.  Go see Jimmy.  He's a fucking pisser.  Oh, but Dave's sitting right there.  No.  What happened?  Oh, no.  We guys.  Our last gig together in Vegas.  That was a sweet one.  You guys together is a fucking great combination, by the way.  It really was good.  We should do more of them.  Loved the Bregata show this year. 
[02:34:00]  Loved it.  Yeah.  That was a good one, huh?  Mm-hmm.  We'll do more.  You know what's great?  It's like every time you play the Bregata, you see the same security people.  Yeah.  We're all kind of like in that.  They sit on their chair.  We all look at each other.  Mm-hmm.  You know?  It's kind of sad.  Yeah.  You know?  I love the Bregata.  I do, too.  It's my fucking place.  Wow.  Yeah.  I don't know what to say.  I'm a high roller.  I would go see Jim if I wasn't working myself tonight.  Do both. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  I think the people can do it.  Yeah.  You go to the stretch factory, then you zip on back for the late show.  You know what?  The mass transit.  I think the last train out of New Brunswick is-  Fuck the train.  You fucking drink like a motherfucker seeing Dave.  1147.  What?  You drink like a motherfucker seeing you, then you hop in your car.  You fucking drive into the city.  I'm listening.  Go ahead.  It's one of the last times I fucking drove drunk.  It was the 4th of July.  We had just gotten off of Billy Mac's-  This is, by the way, something Anthony said on July 5th. 
[02:35:00]  We got off of Billy Mac's boat.  Fucking hammered.  How many years ago?  This is fucking probably-  It's been a while, right?  Maybe seven years ago, something like that.  Wow.  We got off of Billy Mac's boat.  We were fucking hammered.  And someone had the bright idea of saying, let's go into the city to a bar and play some foosball.  And we really raced each other into the city, driving like maniacs, drunk off our asses, into Manhattan on the 4th of July. 
[02:35:30]  How I didn't get fucking pulled over.  That was seven years ago?  Yeah.  It was beyond me.  It was bad.  I don't even remember who the fuck was with me.  Was it maybe the old crew?  Danny Ross?  Fucking Than?  I think Nathaniel?  I remember-  I think that I went the year after when we had limos.  Oh, that's why the limos were-  Yes, yes.  And then we got into the equation.  I was petrified the next day when I got home and- 
[02:36:00]  Want to look at your car?  I looked at the car parked in the driveway, sideways and shit.  Was it sideways a little bit?  Yeah, it was a little sideways.  And I don't know how I ever fucking did that.  It was crazy.  How was the boat part of it?  Because that's-  Great.  Oh, the fireworks.  Even when I was drinking, I never boated it up like that.  The fuck-  It was-  We used to go out all the time, right out of the marina, Flushing Marina.  Go down the river.  Billy Mac, you know, law enforcement. 
[02:36:30]  So we'd get a spot right there on the river by the fucking fireworks.  And it was great, just drinking on a party boat, fireworks, fucking great day.  It was great.  I love boating.  Back in the, what I call, the day.  The day.  Now I just party at my house.  It's easier that way.  Yeah.  You should get a boat.  Get a boat.  What?  Get a boat.  Get crowded in here.  Boats are the worst fucking thing you can get.  Fuck that.  Even look at Louis C.K.  He has a boat now?  Oh, he got a boat, grounded it, and was stranded for a little while. 
[02:37:00]  And that experience made him decide to get a bigger boat.  He's the captain of the Edmund Fitzgerald.  Yeah, now he just bought a bigger boat.  The money that you have to throw into boats is ridiculous.  Speaking of Louis C.K., really quickly, HBO gave us $500 to give away.  Yes, they did.  Because Louis C.K. has that big special tomorrow night at 10 o'clock on HBO called Oh My God.  Yeah.  Matt from Joplin, Missouri won the $500.  Excellent. 
[02:37:30]  Joplin?  He heard the mooie, mooie, mooie, mooie thing.  I bet you that's going to be great.  That's special.  It's going to be amazing.  The reviews are great.  Yeah.  And actually, a few people around here have seen it and said it's unbelievable.  Louis is the man.  He's on top of the world.  Jimmy wants you to feed him the grapes.  Would you do that?  Yeah, because you pop one in your asshole and then squat over my face, and I'll poke your  stomach until it plinks into my mouth.  That's a hell of a way to do it.  I was kidding.  He actually touched my grapes.  No, thank you.  So, Jim, is that the secret to your weight loss there? 
[02:38:00]  It's the grape diet.  Yes.  I love it.  You can eat that whole plate of grapes?  I certainly am.  Wow.  No, I...  Selfish break.  You know, Dave, it's just...  It's a lot of exercise.  Oh, that's right.  Selfish helped.  It was also Big Kev was on that drunk trip, and Rick Shapiro was with us.  No way.  Yes.  That was, um...  I think Ricky's getting married, by the way.  Yeah.  It's Melinda checking in with that, because she was there.  Holy shit.  Yes, he's marrying Tracy.  I can't go, though, because I'm working.  Hi, mini-man.  They're finally getting married. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  They've been together for a while, huh?  Since Tony and Tina's in Tony's wedding.  Oh, a nice yogurt and a big plate of grapes?  You know me, Dave.  You better explain that shitty fucking smell, that fart.  Yeah, well, there's a price to pay for everything, but it's like I say.  Healthy eating, healthy living.  I say that a lot.  No, you shouldn't.  You're just...  You're fucking stinky, smelly fart.  It's beyond, like, farting. 
[02:39:00]  It's so bad, right?  It smells like corruption.  That's true.  It's called the soapacal.  There's nothing fun about it.  It's like...  Yeah.  If you get, like, a...  And everyone goes, ha, ha, ha, ha.  But Jimmy's is...  It's tragic.  Yeah, like decay.  Yes, yes.  Like a school.  Like a train going through Brooklyn with a lot of graffiti on it.  Like, that's your shitty...  The old school.  Like the fucking beginning shot of Welcome Back.  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.  Yeah. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, like New York.  Old, gritty.  Old New York.  Odd Couple era.  It really gets a crazy smell to it, you know?  Are those lightable?  I mean, probably not.  I don't know.  I never wanted to light them, though.  Oh, man.  You're missing his new character, David Tell.  Oh, I'm sorry.  He's setting up his new character, and you're not asking him.  I forgot the new character.  Grape Cheeks.  What's this guy's name?  Grape Cheeks.  He talks with Grape Cheeks.  He just puts Grape Cheeks.  Grape Cheeks.  He's very creative when it comes to naming his characters. 
[02:40:00]  What's that guy's name?  He's got grapes in his cheeks.  Grape Cheeks.  Yeah, I'm good.  All right.  Do you eat all those fucking grapes?  I see you go for the ones...  Up front.  They have a lot of good nutrients in them.  I like a juicy, healthy grape.  I like them a few days old when they're in between grape and raisin.  Oh, yeah.  I like that.  It's like, I don't know if I should wait or just throw them out.  Good for cancer fighting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll go with my chain smoking.  A couple of grapes. 
[02:40:30]  I stick with what works.  Have you tried to quit?  I don't think I'm going to be able to quit for another couple of months.  Why?  Because I'm trying to do a DVD for that show, the porn show.  And then I want to start doing some other stand-up stuff.  I want to get back to the stand-up.  And then, other than that, I'm kind of broke.  So I'm stressed out.  And, like, as you know, ghetto people, we need our pleasures where we can get them, whether  it's...  Simple little vices.  How the fuck is the...  Junk wine or cigarettes or, you know... 
[02:41:00]  How the fuck are you broke?  Well, you know, I'm a white man broke.  I mean, I still have a boat.  Okay.  Not as big as Lou's boat, but a little...  I have a landing craft.  I have a landing craft on...  Why does smoking have to be your pleasure?  Why can't it be, you know...  Handball.  Waving at a small child or perhaps handing a flower to an older person?  This is Grape Jean.  Sorry, who is this guy?  It's just a delightful day. 
[02:41:30]  You know, they've been...  The fun pleasures.  They've been showing that baseball brawl all day.  The pitcher broke his collarbone.  That's going to be the worst.  Oh, fuck.  What is that, like a half a billion dollar wound?  I mean, he's the pitcher.  Yeah.  Man, that is true.  Yeah.  And the other guy was coming out, but he dropped the bat.  So he was like, all right.  Fucking broke his collarbone.  I bet if you don't drop that bat, you get in a lot of fucking trouble.  I would assume so.  Yeah, you're a fucking...  That's an arrest.  Yeah.  But that was the third time he beamed him. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, look at that.  That hurt.  That is.  And he thinks about it.  And he's like, oh, yeah.  They like how he throws himself into the game.  They just don't want him to throw himself into the game the way that he did here.  And certainly, this is not a way of both of what it does.  It's just kind of a great addition.  It's not only involved Granke, but it got so bad and things were so heated that this  actually continued in the players' parking lot as the game after the game, after this  was all over, Matt Kemp confronted a Padres player outside of the stadium. 
[02:42:30]  So there's a lot of things going on here, a lot of moving parts.  But the part that everybody's left over with in the morning is Zach Granke is now out for  quite some time.  And that is a blow for L.A. for sure.  Zach Granke?  Why does it jump?  A little wait for the suspension and the fines to come, right?  So let's switch over.  Wow, they were fighting in the parking lot.  That's old school.  Nice.  Same opening score.  He won with three times.  Pretty good.  Yeah, absolutely.  He's a good job habit.  You're golf people, right?  Not really.  I am.  We're white.  These guys don't really follow. 
[02:43:00]  Because one guy got a hole-in-one.  They should have just, like, right after that.  It should either be hole-in-ones or nothing else.  Because it really is, like, a long on TV.  Golf is really long.  I saw the clip of the hole-in-one yesterday, and they cut it right before the fucking ball  dropped.  Why?  I don't know.  They couldn't believe it.  It's beyond me.  What the hell is that about?  That they don't understand.  Like, you want to see the fucking hole-in-one.  Tiger Woods doing good?  He's in the hunt.  He's four off the leader. 
[02:43:30]  He's two blondes in.  Huh?  I didn't hear you.  He's two blondes in.  This new chick, I don't know if she can...  Augusta.  What's her name?  Ah, she's the skier.  Yeah.  Von, right?  Oh, Lindsey Vonn, I think.  Lindsey Vonn.  I think I met her once, and she had juicy fucking skier legs.  Oh, that's her right there.  That's her right there.  There you go, Dave.  If you ask, there she is on the tape for you.  Cute floppy hat.  Whenever he's done with this country, Tiger, he should definitely move to Norway or just  some place, like, you know, where there's just a million chicks like that. 
[02:44:00]  Well, that kind of shit's acceptable.  Yeah, you know.  Their kind and our kind.  He really has a type, huh?  Mm-hmm.  And it ain't one of the sisters.  Wow.  Mm-mm.  He likes them statuesque fucking...  Well, they're both athletes.  I mean, come on.  Yeah?  Athlete?  Yeah.  What does she do?  She's a skier.  Oh.  What did the other one do?  I don't know.  Oh, the other one?  She was a nanny.  She was a model or something.  Exactly.  She apparently didn't suck fucking Tiger's cock deep enough.  Wow. 
[02:44:30]  I'm glad someone said it.  Got her comeuppance.  Yeah.  Good.  What do you think that fucking Perkins waitress is doing?  I think she's like sitting there going, fuck, man.  Why not me?  Yeah.  Why ain't I standing there?  Why ain't I fucking getting it?  Yeah.  I ate his ass in the parking lot with my fucking apron on.  I ate his ass with a fish stick in my pocket.  You can see him on the green putting and behind him is some fucking woman with a beehive with a pencil in it.  Yeah.  Flo.  Telling the paparazzi to kiss her grits. 
[02:45:00]  Can't understand why you didn't pick her.  Yeah.  I said it in an officer and a gentleman moment is what she was waiting for.  Yeah.  Tiger Woods walks into the Perkins.  Puts that fucking golf visor on her head.  Get the fuck out of here.  You go, girl.  One too many times she put a fucking sticky finger.  It was sticky with like fucking like blueberry jam.  One too many syrup fingers.  Honey buns in the morning.  Yes.  Yeah.  She'd caress his face.  Her finger would smell like dirty diner waitress. 
[02:45:30]  Hey, fucking Perkins slop slinger.  You want to fucking wash your hands before you touch my billionaire face?  Slop slinger.  Hey, fucking ass eater in the parking lot.  You know.  Oh, really?  That gamey ass of hers.  Oh, it was awful.  Ten hours on her fucking, on her dogs.  Yeah, she would always give and she'd probably wonder, why doesn't Tiger eat my pussy?  Oh, fuck.  He would just fuck her in the ass.  Give her a foot massage.  Big bunions. 
[02:46:00]  I bet he'd sodomize her in the fucking parking lot.  Like, would her fucking, she'd have her face in the driver's seat of his Escalade and he'd be standing up behind her.  She'd have to smell his golf ass sweat.  He tried to titty fuck her, but she's just full of filth and just tears.  He couldn't look at her.  He kept sliding off her.  Oh, shit.  The balls kept hitting her bridge.  You know who has the hottest broad at the Masters, though, do you?  Dustin Johnson. 
[02:46:30]  Who's that?  I know I'm stopping by the conversation.  I don't understand, but it's going to lead somewhere.  He's going out with Gretzky's daughter.  Oh, I hear she is a looker.  She is ridiculous.  Can you find a picture of her at the Masters?  Dustin Johnson.  Dustin Johnson, he's right up there with the leaders.  Oh, wow.  He's a very good golfer.  Gretzky's daughter.  And he's now dating Gretzky's daughter.  Wow, how is she beautiful, huh?  Look at that.  How old is she?  Wow.  And she's a bad girl, man.  It must drive her nuts.  I'd love to date her. 
[02:47:00]  I wouldn't mind putting the puck in her scoring.  A hole out of your corner.  That's how she's walking around at the Masters, and they're focusing on Tiger Woods.  That's cool.  Her face looks like Eddie Ift.  Oh, you don't like that?  You know Eddie Ift, the comedian?  Yes.  She looks like Eddie Ift.  Look at them tits.  Yeah.  Eddie's in good shape.  Eddie doesn't have tits.  Look at that.  Is that a real rack?  Probably.  No.  No, it doesn't look real to me.  Her mom had some pretty good tits, though.  Well, go with some more pictures of her. 
[02:47:30]  She's got some half nudes online.  I wouldn't mind squatting over her face and icing her.  Yeah.  I don't want to do hockey terms.  Oh, icing.  Good.  You know what's cool about being a model?  Like, once you hit, like, the famous dude, then, like, you can, like, go, like, now  I'm really just a hot girl.  Yeah.  You know?  Like, whatever.  I can turn off my modeling career for a minute.  Well, I thought that was her pussy.  Look at that.  Wow.  That's not her.  That's her.  She's showing full...  Wow.  No, she's wearing something, right?  This show is just from that chick earlier.  You remember that grizzly bear attack we were watching earlier with that pussy?  Yeah.  Look at this.  Like, this, just like, Jim, what are your... 
[02:48:00]  I mean, really?  No, I think those are panties.  No, that's...  No, she has panties on.  Oh, she has panties on.  Yeah.  I tell you...  I know she's wearing a unitary.  Yeah.  Yeah, she is.  I tell you, looking at her, though, I wouldn't mind taking her to the diner.  Oh, God.  Wow.  He's not bad either.  Look at him.  Yeah, look at the abs and the long shorts.  You know, it's nice to see a professional athlete with real legs, you know?  Well, look at that picture of her and another girl with that big, that fucking green and  red bikinis, the big tits mushed together. 
[02:48:30]  Hi, we're just girls.  Tee-hee-hee-hee.  She is it.  Paulina Gretzky.  The complete package.  She's now a guy with Dustin Johnson.  Damn.  He's a lucky dude.  Wouldn't that be fun if we see Tiger Woods use that...  You know that little tool to take the ball marks out of the green on her muff?  It's called a face cloth.  Like, he bangs her and then pulls it out and starts fluffing her muff back up.  That would be insulting to her. 
[02:49:00]  Jesus.  Her big fucking Perkins waitress muff.  Or if he was going to fuck her and he had his caddy, like, lining up the shot.  Yeah.  You kneel down in front of her and look, yeah.  He's eyeing the taint.  Looks like it's fallen off to the left a little bit.  She never talked, right?  And we haven't heard or seen her since.  From Perkins?  Yeah.  He probably paid her.  Didn't...  No.  We saw one picture of her, I think, when it all went down.  Probably gave her $1.75 and she went away.  She's so happy.  Yeah.  Exactly.  You tell Ty Webb I'm gunning for him. 
[02:49:30]  Here's a bucket of Grits cunts.  Now hit the bricks.  But you kept calling him like, did I leave my dupe pad over there?  Or my tip calculator something?  I think I left my tampons in your glove compartment.  Did you see a crimper?  What's that?  It gets the crumbs off the...  I'm a professional waitress.  Over the years, I've had girls leave things at my house. 
[02:50:00]  They're just fucking like...  Dignity.  Self-respect.  Everything but good memories.  Wow.  See, you paused.  I know.  Your mistake was you paused.  You know that.  Jimmy's funny.  You've been doing this long enough to know you can't pause ever.  Jimmy's fucking funny.  Like, I have a drawer at my house of...  Dedicated to everything that's been left behind?  Like, bras, fucking earrings, rings, fucking... 
[02:50:30]  All kinds of shit that has, you know, been laundered and stuff.  But sometimes it's just like...  Are they things that let people left?  Are they things you wear when David Ferry comes over for a party?  Everybody has to act like they're more in the homosexual community.  Yeah, it's just things that, like, end up outside.  Like, sometimes girls feel compelled to just, you know, take their tops off and jump in the pool. 
[02:51:00]  And then they get out and get a towel.  And they never put their fucking shit back on.  So it's just there in the yard in the morning.  So you know...  In the yard in the morning.  It ends up in the fucking laundry room.  The lost and found, yeah.  And Ange has to wash it.  And then, you know, it ends up in a drawer.  But other ones are like...  They've been sneaky.  They, like, a fucking...  It's cliche, but an earring or something like that.  Or fucking, like, some shit is just left, like, under a dresser in the fucking bedroom and stuff. 
[02:51:30]  It's like, that's some sneaky, repugnant shit right there that chicks pull.  Why?  It's like marking their territory.  Or fucking, like, trying to trip you up if another girl shows up.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, they'll fucking do that.  For Christmas, you should use those as ornaments.  Oh, my God.  Just hang it all on the fucking Christmas.  Oh, yeah.  The regretmas.  The fucking...  The whore tree.  And bring an extra pair of earrings.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're not going to leave their good ones behind. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, they bring the shitty cheap ones and they throw them into your dresser.  Oh, and that gives them an excuse to come back.  I think I left...  Like, I think I left my false leg at your house.  Did you see a left leg up to the thigh?  It smells like an armpit.  Did I leave my favorite catheter over there?  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Did I leave my colostomy on your sink next to your aqua fresh? 
[02:52:30]  I've been shitting all over the inside of my sweater.  I lost my colostomy.  Who is this?  I'm the girl with Crohn's.  Remember that?  You made me blow you and hang my body out the window because I didn't smell good.  Did I leave my do's and don'ts after an epidermal?  You remember me?  I had to hang out the window off the balcony and suck your pita.  Suck your pita.  You yelled at me? 
[02:53:00]  Laugh it up while you can.  Mayor Wiener won't have any of this.  Blowing me while she looks like a boat pumping out the bilge.  Exactly.  So you miss...  It's either that you have Lewis and Clark's flask on your chest.  I'd like you to get the fuck out right now.  Holy shit.  Wow.  So you think these girls do that on purpose over the years?  I think, yeah, I think they have.  Is there a way of like having a connection?  I think they have over the years of like left things like that. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  I mean, I can't see...  I don't know.  Yeah, just shit being left like that.  It doesn't make sense.  She'll have a yard sale.  Can you bring this stuff in?  Nah.  We'll go through it.  That's going to be really sad.  I had a girl leave diamond earrings to her girlfriend.  Really?  We broke up and her diamond earrings were at my house.  And you can bet they'll be re-given.  What am I going to do with them?  Give them back to you?  Oh yeah, sure.  Hey, make sure you fuck a bunch of new people in these. 
[02:54:00]  Not happening.  Not happening.  Girls are sneaky.  Sneaky little things.  I have a few things.  I had a fucking piece of lingerie from a woman one time.  It says gym teacher.  And did you like stroke it out?  Oh my god, that fucking awful hairdo.  She's like, hey look, I'm the webmaster from JoyceDeWitt.com.  There's a girl outside the studio. 
[02:54:30]  Joyce DeWitt.  Fucking awful dude.  Joyce DeWitt.  What a terrible fucking Hardy Boys haircut.  Eating pussy is one thing, but do you have to wear it on your jacket?  We get it.  You love cunt.  Save some for Caroline.  He's putting himself out.  You're going to pull a hand.  Relax.  Holy fuck, Jimmy. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, there's something about that.  Did you see that movie Valley Girls like recently?  Have you seen it?  With Deborah Foreman and Nicolas Cage.  Yeah, he is the most attractive thing in that movie.  Mickey Cage.  Bad, huh?  You can get performance cute.  I remember having a crush on her.  Yeah, she was hot, but now in retrospect, you know.  Let's look at her.  Go ahead.  Yeah, take a look.  Let's take a look at her.  It's the other girl in it who's really hot.  The sluttier one.  Oh, wow.  What do we got here?  There's Deborah.  What's her name? 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to look at her.  Elizabeth Daly.  I don't know her.  Let me see this.  That makes me want to finger my prick.  Let me see her.  Melinda's checking in again.  She goes, I got a great pair of sunglasses from your girl drawer.  They loot my girl drawer.  Let's fucking fuck it up.  I like that.  I can't see because he's over there acting like he's fucking on his iPod at home.  iPod?  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:56:00]  She was adorable to Deborah, but I like that.  The one in the middle, right?  Which one was Deborah for me?  No, she's not in any of them.  That's Pee-wee's fucking chick from Pee-wee's Big Adventure.  Yeah, I like her.  They're all eating roofles.  Let me hear some of the dialogue from Valley Girl.  Because this is fucking my favorite, okay?  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  I wasn't going to say anything.  I always thought she was Julie from The Love Boat, but she's not.  She's the same.  She kind of looks like her.  Julie from The Love Boat wound up.  Because that's that same hair that kind of like hot skates Irish hunger strike hair. 
[02:56:30]  She had her fall from grace.  Julie, the cruise director.  She ended up being crazy.  What are you doing or something?  She loved her blow.  Yeah, they were zooted up.  That movie's now coming up on 30 years old, right?  83.  Amazing.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Holy dog shit.  Wow.  Wow.  83.  What have we got here, fucking Valley Girl?  Hey, where did you?  For sure.  Besides, it's totally gnarly birth control. 
[02:57:00]  I can't stand it.  Full screen bitch.  Okay, so he's awesome.  She's beautiful, Deborah for me.  Valley Girl.  Big guns.  She's out there somewhere.  This is the story of a boy from Hollywood who never dreamed the girl he'd want most was  down here.  Wow.  Wow.  This is all it's all.  Hello.  Who invited you?  Wow.  Oh, wow.  You mean you have to be invited?  That explains it.  I stand corrected. 
[02:57:30]  She had, uh, she cute, but she had a weird mouth.  She's gummy.  A giant gummy mouth.  Yeah, she's like a bunny mouth.  Yeah, like if I met her.  She's got like a bunny rabbit.  And she looks like she almost is wearing a fucking cancer wig.  That was the 80s.  Yeah.  Hey, burn victim wig.  She really bugs me.  The fucking dumb gums.  What was she?  She's probably doing dentist commercials.  That's what we have to see in her.  She's the fucking most sought after actress for gum disease commercials.  You were such a fan two minutes ago.  I can't believe what a turnaround. 
[02:58:00]  But then she smiled.  It looks like when Conan does those things where he puts a fucking superimpose as a mouth.  Wow.  You paused it like at the, look, if you look behind those two white kids, you see like  a colored couple.  Yes.  Look at that.  It's 83.  It's absolutely, they would be called a colored couple.  Back then, yeah.  Yeah.  But it looks like these two have their, it looks like these two have like black thought  bubbles coming out of them.  Black conjoined twins growing out of their heads.  That's good.  Wow.  Look at the very young Nicolas Cage here.  Let's watch the rest of the trailer. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  What?  Well, everyone is dressing.  See, if I had been invited, I would have known this was a costume party.  See, the Urbans are trying not to outdance the white kids.  It's the story about a girl from the valley who never dreamed she'd ever be seen with  a boy from over here.  Yeah.  It's like, I'm not getting out of this car.  All right, but when they attack the car, you save the radio.  That's a classic line.  It's a really lame punk party, man.  How can I see you again?  I'm here with you now. 
[02:59:00]  I know.  She has a fucking dumb Cabbage Patch doll face.  I can't believe I love her.  I told you.  Nick Cage is the hottest one in it.  She's got those dimples.  I don't like her fucking hairdo either.  Short, fat head.  A short, fat.  I bet you that was her nickname in high school.  Hey, gums.  Or, hey, short, fat head.  Valley girl.  Because that's what she should have been killed and her body dumped. 
[02:59:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  She looks like her mom brushing her hair until she's just retarded.  She does look like a tart.  A dressed up tart.  She has a fucking, her hair is like that stupid kitty carry-all doll that's fucking  Cindy lugged around.  I hate her hairdo.  It's kitty carry-all.  As they would say, that's a hair don't.  Remember that?  Oh, yeah.  So-oot.  All right, let's-  How was the style back then?  Yeah.  That's a more-  Fucking doughy-faced idiot she is.  Loving this.  This is the story of Randy and Julie.  The way they come together. 
[03:00:00]  See, that girl's hot.  Who is that one again?  Herman.  Phoebe's a fucking big adventure girl.  Is it my guys who have parties over there?  Where?  Oh, we missed the camel toe shot.  Go back to the camel toe.  I want to see Valley toe.  I think that guy does stand-up now.  Oh.  What, the guy right there?  The evil blonde guy.  No, it's-  Who is that guy?  Every 80s movie had an evil blonde guy.  You're right.  The Karate Kid guy.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Look at the panties on her.  Yeah, that's a giant bit of a camel toe there.  A little bit.  Yeah, and those big fucking hip-hugging panties. 
[03:00:30]  Dottie from fucking Pee-Wee's movie was pretty fucking-  I think she's-  She was pretty cute.  Full package there.  Yeah, I bet she was a goer.  Right?  There?  Where?  At the zoo?  This geek that she's with could scar her for life.  Wow.  I'm gonna be the mad boy she could-  Come on.  Life?  If you think she's confused, you should see her father.  I'm together now.  Who's that guy again?  Oh, boy.  He's right there.  Oh, shit. 
[03:01:00]  He's in the Clint Eastwood movies, right?  Isn't he that guy from Clint Eastwood movies or no?  No.  I don't think so.  He was in a Sonny-  No, he's not Sonny Bono.  He looks like Sonny Bono, though.  Sonny Bono, yeah.  Yes.  No, no.  That guy-  Fuck.  I know who that is.  Oh, he was in the Sonny Bono movie.  He played a tree.  Who is that fucking guy?  I'm trying to think of-  Oh, you know who that is?  Who?  Yeah.  Stopping Queers.  Remember that?  Your subconscious?  From Falling Down. 
[03:01:30]  The guy that was in the-  Oh, shit.  Yes.  He's in the fucking Army-Navy store.  Yes.  He was in Apocalypse Now, too, this guy.  Good call.  I think he was in Apocalypse Now.  That he played Chef.  Yeah.  Am I right?  Is that Chef?  That's the guy from Falling Down.  Is it the same guy?  Yeah, okay.  Wow, it is Chef.  And his wife in this also is in Apocalypse Now.  Oh, man.  Is it Chef?  Yeah, because he's smoking pot going, I'm a so-ci-ate.  So-ci-ate.  Before he goes over.  All right.  Oh, they still hold up. 
[03:02:00]  Who the fuck are these people?  The remote.  Her dumb face.  Randy's hot.  She's from the Valley.  He's not.  He's not.  I know.  Yeah.  Back then when a man just punched another man in the face.  What an awful trailer.  Yeah.  She has a fat, bald face.  He's a cobra.  He's a cobra.  Is that the big joke?  This is a big movie.  The Clash.  Bananarama.  Modern English. 
[03:02:30]  Psycho-dove furs.  Yes.  It's good.  They give away the ending of the movie.  The blasters.  Yeah.  The guy from the wrong side of the tracks.  You know what I fucking hate hearing in a goddamn theater after a trailer?  Okay.  I knew what you were going to say.  I don't know.  Whatever you hear after.  What do you hate hearing?  Something that would signify happiness.  Right.  Or community feelings.  When a trailer ends and you hear like the little mumbling and you hear like, that looks 
[03:03:00]  good.  Yeah.  That annoys the piss out of me.  Yeah.  Because it never looks good.  Shut up.  It doesn't.  It never does.  But that movie was the most unbelievable.  Not one Mexican.  Not one.  No.  Like anywhere.  Not even like, what's going on?  Not even like the over the top Mexican.  Over the top fucking.  Nothing.  It was just like white people on white people.  Yeah.  Wow.  Unbelievable.  That's not California.  Even in the 80s.  Yeah.  Maybe the 1880s.  That girl did have a dumb face. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  I can't believe I was good though.  You were really into her?  I thought she was the fucking bee's knees.  I had no idea that she fucking had those giant gums and a short fat doll face.  That's like when I like Buddy from Family.  You remember like Buddy from Family?  Buddy from Family?  Fucking Christy McNichol.  Yeah.  Like before she, whatever happened.  I mean, she was, there was something hot about her because she was the approachable one.  Yeah.  Even that show became a hornet's nest of just same gender issues. 
[03:04:00]  Whatever was going on there.  They built that on a gay Indian burial ground in that house.  It really turned into a.  I think everybody in that show turned, whatever.  Get the cast of Family up there.  Yeah.  Buddy.  And then who's the daughter?  Christy McNichol did end up being a lesbo.  Because Richard, Richard, Richard, my, my buddy Richard, who was, ended up being gay and dying 
[03:04:30]  of the AIDS.  Wow.  He used to go and go out on dates with her as a beard.  Really?  Yeah.  That was like his job to make her look like she was fucking, you know, not a lesbo.  Huh.  Yeah.  Kim Richard.  Yeah.  Kim Richards.  Kim Richards used to be hot when, um, for 10 minutes in the 80s.  Oh, no.  She's, she's, she's on the Bad Girls Club or something like that, right?  No, she's on the Housewives or something.  Now she's bat shit crazy.  She's super hot, though.  And looks 80 years old. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah.  I don't care.  She's hot.  Give her a smooch.  I like her in Nanny and the Professor.  Oh, God, was she hot in that.  That's great.  Another unbelievable situation.  Exactly.  Right.  You know who she's related to?  Uh, who?  Paris Hilton.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's like her aunt, right?  Some kind of fucking.  Kim Richards is Paris Hilton's aunt, yes.  Wow.  That's a lot of smartness.  There was an 80s movie she did where she had, like, crimped hair and she looked pretty  good in that.  And she was, like, in, like, zero, what, she was in the high school, like, the Apocalypse 
[03:05:30]  High School thing one time.  Yeah.  One time.  One time.  Over there.  Yeah, whatever.  She was, like, some, play some goth chick.  I don't know.  What the fuck?  She is hot.  What?  Yeah.  Where's what?  I like when they show them, like, hot it up and then that, that really kind of pedophile-y  picture of them when they were little.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Yeah.  There she is, all 80s'd out.  A little mixed message.  She's a lovely girl.  She went to shit really, really quick.  Quite the day.  Quite the day.  Really quickly.  That's what she looks like now. 
[03:06:00]  You know who is fucking hot as fuck now?  Oh, dude.  That dumb little girl that was in the ring?  You know, the one that comes out of the fucking well.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I saw you tweet them.  Dude.  I saw you tweet them.  Wow.  She's fucking cute as fuck.  That's the same girl, huh?  Yes.  I wouldn't mind smooching with her.  That girl got really hot.  I like her evil looking.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wouldn't have to fuck her in the movie.  I would want her to do that.  Pull her out of the well, eat her ass, throw her back in.  I don't want her to blow me and just put her hair over her head so it looks all evil.  I always want her to do that. 
[03:06:30]  My dick sucked, so it's cool.  So I don't have to see their dumb face and their loving look while I fantasize they're anyone  but who they really are.  Could you put your hair over your face, please, so I don't have to acknowledge you?  Okay.  I ain't no fucking pecker sucker.  Ah, right.  Chippa.  Yeah, she ended up really hot. 
[03:07:00]  There's a few girls that, like, it's still, you know who didn't.  Abroad from Blossom is really fucking hot.  Wow.  She was on the big bed.  Yeah.  That's right.  That fucking hot.  That's her, huh?  From the ring.  I'd take her out.  Very pretty.  A movie or something?  She looks like somebody we know.  You know who didn't end up hot?  Dakota Fanning.  I thought she was going to kind of, she kind of looks weird.  Her body's a little weird.  A little dumpy.  I mean, she's not.  She just got too old for you.  No, I was waiting for her. 
[03:07:30]  She's not.  Oh, yeah.  She just looks a little dumpy.  Is she in that movie Teeth?  Is she that chick?  I don't know.  She's all right.  She's okay.  She's all right.  That's really gussied up.  Yeah, okay.  Let's see her at normal.  Give us a plain one.  She's all right.  I like it.  She's cute.  She's all right.  All right.  Calm down.  I'd give her a smooch.  Well, yeah.  I'm not saying I wouldn't.  I'd give her a kiss on the old cheek.  I could see her working in the garden.  I thought she was going to be better than that.  How's it going back there?  I thought she was going to be pretty hot.  Well, you know.  She looks like a little English trollop. 
[03:08:00]  What the fuck?  Well, that's true.  Speaking of English trollop, also the one from fucking Harry Potter.  Oh, let's see her.  Emma Watson.  Emma Watson?  No?  You're not into that Emma Watson?  She was like...  She's a little boyish.  Yeah.  She's got a little boyish.  I like that.  Yeah?  Well, look at that.  Don't shoot the fucking dyke hair.  Wow.  Sam.  That's cool.  Get a fucking picture of her body and everything, you fucking freak.  She's handling fucking William H. Macy in that picture.  How about another fucking...  Oh, she's good in that one.  She's got a little head, though. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah.  It's tiny.  Models have little heads.  Sure they do.  It's weird.  They have tiny little heads.  Exactly.  Because they're dumb.  Dumb little fucking brontosaurus heads.  They're heads made for not shoving much food in.  There's two thoughts in there.  Oh, that's her in a bikini.  No.  It's probably Photoshopped.  Photoshopped.  She is very Photoshopped online.  There you go.  She looks pissed off there.  I don't know.  It's just something about her.  Girl next door-ish.  Yeah, I'd fool around with her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She looks like she's from, like, British Columbia or some other white place.  No, she's very...  That's not bad at all. 
[03:09:00]  She's English?  Is that it?  Yeah.  She's fucking limey.  So then she's amazingly hot compared to their pool.  What about the bikini shot?  Over, over, over, over, over.  Thank you.  There you go.  What is that?  A dick?  No.  You see that?  I almost fell in love with it.  There's a strap on it.  Ah, dude.  What is that?  What are they doing?  That's unfortunate.  That's a bad fucking...  That's a bad shot.  It's like a gooey duck cock.  It's a terrible one.  A dog penis.  It does look weird something's in the picture, but...  Yeah, that's all right. 
[03:09:30]  You can fucking...  No, that's unfortunate.  That was behind her body.  It's a lawn chair.  You could go down on that.  I love that chick.  These English women, they just pop up all over.  The Game of Thrones girl.  Not the super Khaleesi one, but the other one that was also on the...  Well, the Queen one is pretty hot, but the new one, she was also on the Tudors.  The girl that's learning to sword fight?  No, yeah.  That little urchin?  Yeah, I like her.  No, the...  She was on the Tudors.  She's really hot.  She's dark-haired, and she's another Anglo.  Anglo, yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:10:00]  Some of them fucking...  I think it's a left turn.  They should put the girl from Precious in there, just as like a weird left turn.  Right?  Yes.  Get her, you know, get her working.  You know what country has girls that are not really hot, but kind of almost hot?  Australia.  I'll tell you, every picture you see of an Australian girl, there's something a little  fucking off.  They're like, inbreeding.  And then there's just something that's a little off. 
[03:10:30]  There's some pretty girls in Australia, though.  But he's going with the 20 hottest Australian girls.  Would you fucking come on?  You said every.  Go with Australian chick.  Regular Australian.  Average Australian girl.  I'm just looking for Australian girls.  Just put Australian girl without the fucking, like, you know.  Without the fucking...  Turn off the hot filter.  Pick them the 20 hottest.  Exactly, Sam.  Stop going for the cream of the crop.  No, there are...  I'm talking regular Australian girls.  You're looking at nothing but really hot fucking girls right now.  You're so full.  Your argument's full.  You're talking about the regular girl. 
[03:11:00]  Yes.  The regular, like, walking down the street.  The regular girls.  They look like that.  They're very average.  Yeah.  That's what I mean.  She's cute.  She's cute.  She's not average?  Yeah, she's all right.  Yeah, but, you know, they...  There you go.  She's average.  That's much better right there.  They're a little...  Exactly.  A fucking frump.  Stupid fucking...  She probably works in a zoo.  Too many moon pies and...  Yeah, too many shrimp on the barbie.  Too many gigantic beers.  I just noticed.  She rescues kangaroo abortions. 
[03:11:30]  Like when a kangaroo is kicked in the stomach by another kangaroo.  Yeah, look.  See?  There's just...  She's cute.  Something there, but...  She's fine.  Something's just a little...  She looks like her name is Louise.  With her dumb fucking cheekbones.  Hello.  I'm Louise.  Want to go out?  Yeah.  Looks like I'm holding little things in my cheeks.  We'll go out.  Give a couple of beers.  Maybe go out on a boat.  Yeah, but I bet you their chick is, like, hotter. 
[03:12:00]  They're just, like, all the way across.  Yeah.  Compared to the...  I don't know.  East Timorians.  Well, yeah.  East Timorians are known to be ugly, ugly people.  Peoples.  Yeah.  You know who are really hot?  These Ethiopian Jews.  Have you seen any pictures of them?  Stunning.  Cheekbones.  Cheekbones to hear.  Cheekbones for David.  It must be their false god.  I don't know what to tell you.  They believe in the bagel, you know, Jesus.  Kneecaps like a newborn foal. 
[03:12:30]  Reward them with some beautiful...  Yeah, they do look District 9, you know.  I love District 9.  Kind of buggy.  Kind of open a can of cat food.  They'll come crawling out.  But they're very good.  They join the army.  They do their cake time.  Kind of buggy.  Jesus Christ.  Otherworldly.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Well, I guess Australia's all right.  Maybe I'm just talking to my fucking ass over here. 
[03:13:00]  I think they're hot.  I don't know why.  Guys, I gotta go.  Where are you going, Jimmy?  I have an appointment at 10.30.  An appointment?  Yeah.  It's all good.  Fuck it.  Is it something we should worry about?  No.  No, no, no.  It's about doing a little something.  Start with an A, end with an Z.  Caroline's tonight.  Late show, maybe, and then Sunday.  Yes, I'll be there Sunday to see our own Jimmy Norton.  And the Goobies next week in Baltimore.  Nice.  In Baltimore.  I'm taking the Wire tour. 
[03:13:30]  Oh.  It's not a Wire tour.  No, I'm just kidding.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah, but that'd be cool.  That would be great.  That is a good idea.  That'd be awesome.  Baltimore.  David Tell, Stress Factory?  Yes.  Ready to go.  Tonight and tomorrow?  With the one and only Chips Cooney.  What's that?  You know Chips?  Girl Chips Cooney.  What's that?  From America's Got Talent.  Right?  Yep.  One of the best regional magicians.  If I was a slave owner.  If you like magic with a little comedy, he's your guy. 
[03:14:00]  He's doing the opening.  It's going to be fun.  All right.  Thanks for having me in, guys.  Appreciate it.  Anytime.  Love, David Tell.  We also should remind the people that Louis C.K., the big special is tomorrow night.  Oh, my God.  It debuts tomorrow at 10 on HBO.  HBO.  Huh?  HBO.  We have to do more time on Louis C.K.?  Yeah.  I mean, that was five of six.  But we did a lot of time on Louis C.K. this week.  And it was a lot of extra time, too. 
[03:14:30]  Huh?  Are you looking forward to that?  Yeah, I really am.  Yeah, you could do this one.  I think it's going to be great.  Louis special, I can't wait to see it.  I think it's going to be, it's amazing.  First of all, to do a special every year like he's been doing is just an incredible amount  of work.  And each one is just better than the last one.  So I'm a huge fan.  And, you know, I can't wait to see it.  I think he starts doing a lot of movies.  Who he's going to, you think?  I think.  Yeah.  I think it's going to get tougher and tougher for this guy to stand up.  It's going to be great. 
[03:15:00]  I think he's moving into the movie business myself.  You think he's going to be acting in movies or making them himself?  Both.  He's a very independent guy.  He's going to do very, very well.  What do you got there, Roland?  Wow.  Looks like the Louis C.K.  Oh, there you go.  Wow.  Marshall's going in.  Looks like I don't have to wait until 10 o'clock tomorrow night on HBO to see Louis C.K.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to watch this as I drive home through the Queen's Midtown Tunnel Toll Plaza.  Very good. 
[03:15:30]  Those fuckers are after me, by the way.  Oh, nothing.  Have you seen the special?  Yeah, it's funny.  Well, you've got to give us a little more than that.  Why is it funny?  She goes on stage and goes, hey, guys.  Tells some jokes.  Stories and little anecdotes.  Spoiler alert.  Stories.  Does it get edgy?  Antidotes.  Does it get edgy?  Antidotes.  Yeah.  He's like, what's the poison?  Wait, what's up, you cunts?  Oh.  For the poison you just drank, Dr. Jones.  Antidote.  Antidote. 
[03:16:00]  Antidote.  60 minutes later, ta-da, it's over.  Oh.  Well, that's an amazing review for Louis C.K.'s Oh, My God special.  Yes.  I know you poo-pooed it there, but I think it's going to be great.  That's Roland excited about something, Dave.  Oh, okay.  You're very confused.  You're a little jaded.  No, it's the antidote to the average Saturday night.  There you go.  I like that.  There you go.  Louis C.K., Oh, My God, debuts tomorrow night at 10 o'clock on HBO.  Let's all watch people.  For sure.  Thank you, David.  Tell.  Thank you for having me.  See you soon, buddy.  Stress Factory this weekend.  Let's not forget.  Yes, of course. 
[03:16:30]  Oh, Joe Curry wanted me to mention that he will be, as I get it, and stretch while I'm getting  his thing.  I have a bunch of Opie and Anthony mixtapes to give away on the after show.  Oh, I'm going to be listening on the way home as I maybe go through the Queens Midtown  Tunnel and maybe go to the Queensborough Bridge.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Don't get all message board crazy.  So all you fucking toll takers down at the Queens Midtown Tunnel, I might be coming through. 
[03:17:00]  Then again, I might not.  So you're teasing them.  Keep your eyes peeled.  Why don't you tell them you're going there?  Make it exciting.  Should I go through?  Yeah.  Should I take the tunnel today?  Today you're going through.  They're on to me.  Throw money at them.  Just tell.  Today you're going through, though.  They put out a be on the lookout for me because I beeped.  And they're fucking pissed.  You fucking motherfuckers.  I'm taking the bridge.  I need my weekend.  Here he is. 
[03:17:30]  Joe Curry will be at IJ Cans in Winchester, Virginia tomorrow.  So if you're near IJ Cans in Winchester, Virginia tomorrow night, 9 o'clock show, go see Joseph Curry.  There you go.  That sounds like an exciting fucking time, man.  In Vaginia.  Very good.  Yeah.  Other than that, everyone, I guess, well, are we through?  Yeah, we're done.  Let's get out of here.  All right.  See you guys.  Mundy. 
[03:18:00]  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Oh.  Yes, yes, yes.  Friday.  These headphones are low.  So, I mean, there we go.  Okay.  I think I might like, I don't know what I like better.  The show or the show that goes on while the show is on that nobody gets to be a part of. 
[03:18:30]  There's two shows.  Those are fun.  Huh?  Sometimes those are fun.  Well, you host the ones.  For the most part, you host the shows that nobody gets to hear.  Yeah.  Like, the show that happens while the show is on that people don't get to be a part of,  that's the E-Rock show for the most part, I feel like.  You know what I mean?  Like, what's going on in here in the studio, that's the show.  And then there's a little E-Rock show that's happening right just behind the curtain. 
[03:19:00]  Mm-hmm.  And a lot of times that's just as fun as what's going on in the studio.  Is that right?  Yeah, it depends on the day, the situation.  It just tickled me right before we went on the air.  I don't know why, but we're cleaning up the studio.  Sal and intern Alan Thicke, Jr.  And Jim left his grapes here.  You heard Jim talking about his grapes.  It's the same grapes that he uses to create the character of Grape Cheeks.  And Sal, like it's normal, just goes,  Hey, Alan, you want these leftover grapes? 
[03:19:30]  And Alan goes, Oh, yeah.  Like, Hell, yeah, I want those grapes.  It's really funny.  How's today been, Alan?  Take your time, buddy.  We got nothing but time.  I showed up late today.  You did?  Why is that?  I was hanging out with a friend of mine yesterday,  and her neck started swelling up because she put on hair dye,  and she was allergic to it. 
[03:20:00]  So I had to walk her to the emergency room.  What type of excuse is this?  This is the craziest thing I've ever heard in my life.  I swear to God.  All right, so you're hanging out with your friend, who's a girl.  Yeah.  You're hooking up?  No, no, no, we're just friends.  Were you trying to get it in?  No, no.  Why not?  Why don't you get yourself a little piece of that?  Because she's mean and crazy.  So why are you hanging out with her to begin with?  Not very many people are hanging out with me for the most part.  Why is that?  They think I'm abrasive.  Are you? 
[03:20:30]  I don't know.  Am I?  Why don't you work on that?  I do, but...  Do you?  Well, I mean, I'm a lot better than I was freshman year of college.  You think so?  What year are you in now?  I'm finishing up my junior year.  Okay, so over the past three years, you've worked on your abrasiveness.  Right.  And you feel like you're a lot better.  I am a lot better.  But still, nobody will hang out with you.  What type of abrasiveness were you before?  How come people stopped hanging out with you?  What would you do?  People just think that I'm loud and aggressive.  Right.  And are you? 
[03:21:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  So the answer is, I am loud and aggressive.  I am loud and aggressive.  In what way?  What's an example of something you've done that make people go,  maybe I should take a second and think about this  before I let this douche hang out with me again?  I remember one time in freshman year,  we found out that Third Eye Blind was going to be,  that we were spending our entire entertainment budget  to have Third Eye Blind play for our spring weekend.  That seems like a lot for a little. 
[03:21:30]  Well, yeah.  And I thought it was complete bullshit and BS  because I saw all the other bands that were like...  That was quick.  You always have Third Eye Blind in queue, huh?  Always.  You have Fandango and Third Eye Blind ready to go to moment's notice.  I hate Third Eye Blind.  Why is that?  I just think they're this nothing shitty band from the 90s.  But isn't it a little happy?  Doesn't it make you feel better?  Do, do, do.  It's a happy song about crystal meth.  Don't you...  What?  No.  This is about finding a girl.  This isn't about crystal meth.  And doing crystal meth.  It's about crystal meth?  Yeah, the whole song is... 
[03:22:00]  No, it couldn't be.  This is about finding a girl in high school  and it's summer and you're going to prom with her.  And her little pink panties face down on the mattress.  Oh my gosh.  I've never listened to the lyrics, I guess.  Seems a little edgy.  It seems like right up your alley.  Seems abrasive.  Seems a little hardcore.  You got your grapes.  Enjoy your grapes, Alan.  Don't let me take you away from your grapes.  How come you don't like Third Eye Blind?  I don't know.  I'm more annoyed by how, like...  I'm more annoyed by how much people like Third Eye Blind 
[03:22:30]  than I actually hate the band itself.  Well, what's wrong with them?  I just think that they're a nothing band.  They're not offensive.  They're not good.  They're just nothing.  And I know so many people are like,  I love Third Eye Blind.  And they always talk about this fucking do-do-do song.  It's a great song.  It's an okay song at best.  It was a number one hit.  I love Jumper, man.  Yeah.  You know that song, Jumper?  What do you think of this song?  This is a good one.  Great song.  This is like a springtime, summery...  Yeah, exactly.  ...start a song, yeah.  Same here.  Oh, you say just do a little meth? 
[03:23:00]  Is that what you just said?  Well, it's about hooking up with this girl  and getting strung out and just fucking a lot.  You know Third Eye Blind?  We're singing about crystal meth, Troy?  Yes.  I didn't know that.  Alan is not a Third Eye Blind fan.  Are you a Third Eye Blind guy?  You know what?  I didn't like Third Eye Blind when they were out.  And then now I like...  Well, you're kind of a 90s bitch, right?  A little bit, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Are you a Third Eye Blind fan, Joel?  Yeah.  Yes.  How does it go? 
[03:23:30]  And the other one, they...  Did you play Jumper?  That's what Sam was just saying.  He loves Jumper, man.  Yeah.  It's such a...  Is this...  Oh, I know this song.  Is this the song you guys like?  Well, sometimes when I'm DJing, like at the end of the night when it's coming down, I'll  throw this one on and people lose their minds.  Well, that's because everybody's used to every fucking hack DJ playing Journey at the  end of the night.  Right.  Yeah, I throw on shit like this.  Or Semisonic's Closing Time.  Right.  And it's like, yeah, I remember this from 99. 
[03:24:00]  They've been playing it ever since.  It's not a throwback if they just won't stop playing the song.  There has to be a pause in time when the song's not being played anymore for it to have  that effect.  Right.  But people still love the song.  Closing Time never stopped being played, so it's still annoying.  Yeah, it's a lame song.  This song you don't hear usually when the bar is closing.  The thing I did when I was working on Lithium, he came in, Stephen Jenkins, the singer.  Yeah.  And he was just...  He was an asshole.  He was.  Yeah.  Good for him though, right?  He was just a jerk.  I kind of like that.  Yeah.  I mean, it's like...  You kind of hope he's a little bit cooler though. 
[03:24:30]  It's like, come on, dude.  Like, what have you done in the past?  You know?  But that's kind of fun.  You're like...  He's like coming in.  He's like, I'm the douche from Third Eye Blind who had two singles.  And you're like, all right, cool.  Yeah.  You know?  You could be a dickhead.  They were massive.  So you're getting all pissed off right now, Alan, that we're spending all this time talking  about Third Eye Blind instead of you?  No.  You're getting a little heated?  Nah, nah.  Because I remember yesterday, you were all fired up that I was talking to Opie and Jim  instead of you.  No, it's...  I just...  Well, Sam, they have two other songs if you want to explore those.  Let's...  No, let's...  I mean, you could... 
[03:25:00]  You know, they could be playing in the background a little bit, but let's not...  I'll mix it up.  I had a little bit of a narcissistic rage yesterday.  Yeah.  I understand that.  It's just one of these things where it's like, I just figure that I will never be able  to get my box out on the air.  All right.  Let's not...  I mean, that's disgusting.  Disgusting.  That is gross.  And I don't need to know all the personal details of your life.  But, um, how'd today go?  What do you mean?  How was work today?  As far as work, yeah.  I mean, I felt like an asshole. 
[03:25:30]  I woke up an hour late.  What time did you wake up?  5.30.  And, right, so you woke up late because, what, you were hanging out with your female person  that you know who's crazy and mean to you, but you hang out with her while she dyes her  hair?  Well, no, she dyed her hair, like, the night before.  And she was allergic to, um, when, like, the ingredients inside the hair dye.  Right.  And, like, she was thinking that because it was amber instead of red that she'd be okay,  but her neck completely swelled up.  All right. 
[03:26:00]  You like that, Roland?  I love it.  That's, like, a funny thing to you?  It makes me laugh.  Like, a little, like, a little, like, look at you.  It's a little practical joke.  I don't want to interrupt Alan, though, but if there's, like, one good call today, you  have an option to give away one Django.  Holy shit, we have a Django Unchained Blu-ray?  If the good call today.  Everybody wants shit today because I got all those Opie and Anthony mixtapes.  Who Kid made an Opie and Anthony mixtape?  And it's hip-hop music.  It's rap with samples.  So, you know, there's music on it, but it's hosted by Opie, Anthony, Jim, and me.  And it's Biggie. 
[03:26:30]  So it's like, how do you not love Biggie?  And then it's the samples that Biggie used, which are great classic songs.  Did you listen to the tape?  Yeah.  It's good, right?  Yeah, it's really good.  Yeah, but if there's no good call today, we'll save it for Monday.  Okay.  So she, her neck swelled up.  Yeah, her neck swelled up.  I mean, I didn't really get to figure out what happened for too long.  I just waited at the hospital until her best friend showed up.  Why were you waiting at, why wouldn't you just, do you have a car?  Did you have to drive her to the hospital?  No, I walked with her.  Why?  Because we're in the Bronx.  So? 
[03:27:00]  Well, she has a swollen neck.  Nobody's going to rape somebody with a swollen neck.  Right?  I mean, Sal, am I crazy?  It is the Bronx, though.  Yeah.  But she's got a, all right.  I mean, I don't hang out in the Bronx that much, maybe.  Not a safe neighborhood.  All right.  So you are, are you the great protector?  Like, there's a Czechoslovakian tall blonde kid or something.  You know, I'm not going to mess with her.  I don't know.  I think people might, like, mistake me for an Albanian, which is like, the Albanian mob's  pretty big in my neighborhood.  All white with pink eyes?  Oh, okay.  Or they just wait for him to fall asleep. 
[03:27:30]  That's, uh, Albanian.  Oh.  Simpsons reference.  Okay, so.  You bring her to the hospital.  Right.  Why don't you just leave her there?  I don't know.  I felt weird.  What time was it?  At that point, it was about 2.15.  In the morning?  Yeah.  All right.  So this doesn't have anything to do with the bullshit of the hospital.  This means that by the time her neck swelled up, it's already 1 o'clock in the morning.  Right.  All right.  So you were going to hang out with this chick until later at night, regardless of any hospital.  Well, when we started talking about, like, the whole, like, neck swelling thing.  The neck swelling thing, right? 
[03:28:00]  Okay.  Well, okay.  Like, I met up with her after my class finished at 9 o'clock.  P.M.  P.M.  Yeah.  And, uh, I just met up with her because, you know, I was waiting for her.  You're trying to slip it in.  It's okay, Alan.  You can slip it in.  No.  Um.  The, the, I ended up spending that in my girlfriend's apartment that night because I  was waiting for her.  You have a girlfriend?  Well, we.  You broke up?  Yeah, like a week ago.  It's, it's weird.  How come you broke up?  I dated her for, like, a year and a half and I was just kind of over it after a while.  You broke up with her? 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  It's very abrasive of you.  Yeah, I know.  I still kind of feel like a dick about it.  Do you like her?  Are you in love with her still?  I mean, she's, she's a nice girl.  I'm just kind of over being with the same girl for over a year and a half.  Is it going to hurt you when you see her hooking up with another dude?  Because she's going to.  You think so?  She's going to need that dick from somewhere.  And I don't mean any offense by that, but a girl needs a dick, you know?  Yeah.  I, I mean.  Troy, am I wrong?  No, you're right.  I mean, I just, I don't know.  I, I, I had, um.  I mean, I had a lot of problems with being her, with her in the first place. 
[03:29:00]  Why, like what?  Uh, my parents didn't like that she was black.  Um.  You were with a black girl for a year and a half.  I was with a black girl for a year and a half.  Now, is this a Bronx black girl or, or like a, a white black girl?  No, she's from Houston.  So.  But is this like, is she Southern?  Or is she from the Dirty South?  Does she twerk?  Yeah, she, she twerks.  She can't twerk?  She, she, she.  How old is she?  Uh, 21.  She hot?  Yeah.  Let me see her picture.  Yeah, yeah.  Can I take a look at that too?  Let's take a look at this chick. 
[03:29:30]  How is, how is he pulling black chicks?  That's what I want to know.  He's a very, maybe, maybe she likes the abrasiveness.  He's obviously quite abrasive.  Yeah.  Especially black chicks that can twerk.  Yeah.  Can I be an ass?  What, what's twerk?  Oh, Sal.  You're obviously, you're a terrible hipster.  Here, look it up.  Yeah, let's find the, show me a picture of this, uh, twerking chick.  Here.  Oh, okay.  All right, hold on.  Just look it up.  Look it up for yourself.  Twerking.  It's what all the kids are doing.  I'll just look her up.  Just look up twerk videos on YouTube.  Right, right.  They're great.  Fine for hours.  All right, while you're looking that up, let's go to Garth in Indiana. 
[03:30:00]  What's up, Garth?  Hey, Brian.  How are you doing, buddy?  Good, man.  Just sitting here drinking a Beeman Coke and, uh, took me a nice Taco Bell shit.  Wait, what, you're in Indiana.  It's, it's the morning.  Yeah, but I got Fridays off, so.  So, it's on.  It's five o'clock somewhere.  Yeah, buddy.  So, I called in for one of those mixtapes, dude, but before I hang up and jerk off some  internet porn, I'm going to get that Django Unchained first.  Uh, yeah, no, I'm not going to give that to you, but I will put you on hold for a mixtape. 
[03:30:30]  All right, man.  All right.  Thanks, buddy.  Stay on hold.  Uh, Dan.  Dan in Massachusetts.  Hey, what's going on, Dan?  How you doing, buddy?  Not pretty good.  I was hoping you got one of those mixtapes.  All right, you got it.  Stay on hold.  Oh, thank you.  All right, you got this picture, Alan?  I don't know.  Facebook's not loading up.  God damn it, Alan.  I'm with everything.  It's always something with you.  I just want to see a look, take a look.  I get so frustrated.  It's how I feel.  It's like, I'm just like, ah!  I want to see this picture. 
[03:31:00]  I was in the same situation the other night.  I'm going, ah!  I'm all lathered up.  I'm ready to shave.  I'd forgotten to buy blades.  I didn't have any blades.  What's your dollar shaver?  Well, no, I was looking around.  I was digging through the trash.  But I didn't want to use the old blade that zombied out my face yesterday.  That's why I look like this.  I was one step away from stealing my wife Jess's lady razor, whatever that is.  This was my Dollar Shave Club moment, and I'd like to share it with you.

[03:32:30]  I'd say she's about 5'5".  Okay.  That was us celebrating Texas.  Is that her kid?  No.  It's not a crazy question to ask?  No, not at all.  No, that was her when she was a baby.  DJ who kid?  You just stopped in.  This kid Alan Thicke right here, Alan Thicke Jr.?  Yeah.  He just broke up with a black woman that he dated for a year and a half because he was tired of her twerking all the time.  She's hot, though.  Keep going, keep going, keep scrolling.  I thought he had a black baby.  Yeah, that's not a bad picture of her. 
[03:33:00]  Which one, this one?  That one.  Yeah.  That's her right there.  Wow, she's nice, yo.  I thought you had a black baby.  That's her baby pic?  Well, yeah.  Did you get her pregnant at all?  Did any abortions throughout the relationship?  That's her or that's your baby?  A couple morning after pills, but...  There were some morning after pills.  There were some morning after pills.  How did those come about?  Just not being prepared or a condom broke or what happened?  Condom breaking.  Condom breaking.  Yeah.  Your manhood was just too strong for those condoms, huh?  Good for you, Alan.  Good for you.  Man, you don't pull out, man?  No.  No, he's dating a black girl. 
[03:33:30]  You know what I mean?  He's got to get down with the community.  Excuse me.  Jango.  They're fertile.  And this is the girl that I had to take to the emergency room last night?  Why are you hanging out with your ex's friends for?  No, I mean, we were all friends before I started dating out with the...  Yeah, but once you stop dating the girl, you stop hanging out with her friends.  Especially if you stop bringing them to the hospital like a fucking herb.  Did you fuck her?  The other one.  This one?  The white girl?  No, no.  You'd like to, though.  Nah.  You don't walk somebody to the hospital and stay there all night with them if you don't 
[03:34:00]  want to fuck them.  Is that right, Troy?  Unless you're a Fagula.  Are you Fagula?  What's a Fagula?  I don't think he is.  Do you?  Fagula.  No.  I mean, he almost impregnated that black chick multiple times.  You're true.  You know?  He's not new to the game.  He's true to the game, Troy.  Was her pussy wet?  Like, outside?  What?  Like, when?  Like, through the panties?  I mean, I don't know.  I haven't fucked a black girl in a while.  I'm trying to remember.  You prefer white women.  We were giving out some mixtapes a minute ago. 
[03:34:30]  So, all right.  So, Alan Thicke.  This chick, first of all, would you be upset if your ex started fucking Troy, for instance?  Wow.  Like, would that upset you?  By the way, I'd have no problem with that.  Well, I know that.  You fucked interns' exes before.  No, and they weren't interns when that happened.  Okay.  The thing is, like, Troy's...  They were barely exes when that happened.  Troy's built up a lot of goodwill with me.  I like Troy a lot.  Yeah, but so did the intern, and then he fucked his girlfriend.  Well, I also gave the intern fair warning. 
[03:35:00]  Wow.  We had an intern named Intern Sean, and there was a lot of weirdness with him.  He had a lot of Salisms to him, but I think he was even more weird than Salas.  More in the closet.  Yeah, way more in the closet.  He, at one point, kind of said that he'd been dreaming about myself and Troy.  Like, it got very strange.  We talked to him about his girlfriend.  Troy told him, if I meet your girlfriend, I'm going to fuck her.  He introduced Troy to his girlfriend.  You know what Troy did? 
[03:35:30]  He fucked her.  He did.  Yes, he did, Alan.  That's hot.  So what I'm telling you is...  She was a Dominican chick.  What I'm telling you is...  She didn't look that different from this chick, did she?  No, she actually sort of looks like a little bit of a...  A lot of similarities.  What I'm telling you, Alan, is...  I like that ethnic look.  You do.  I love it.  A little thickness.  A little thick.  A little brownness.  Full lips.  Brown.  I love brown.  You like that?  Yeah.  Tango.  You can't relate to that who, kid.  You don't understand?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I like the mixes.  You like mixes.  See, we're switching.  Like, he gives me all the black bitches, then I'll throw him some white bitches. 
[03:36:00]  Right.  And then you trade the mixes.  Yeah.  It's still interracial.  That's what counts.  You gotta collect them all.  You gotta collect them all.  And there's so many combinations.  What I'm saying is, would you be upset if Troy started fucking your ex?  Because it's a possibility.  Yeah, but that's his ex.  I don't think...  I mean, yeah.  Here's the thing.  Like, I'm over it.  You are over it.  I am over it.  Good for you.  So, it's one of these things.  It's just like...  Is it a racial thing?  You're trying to move on to the white girls, or...?  Nah, I mean, literally...  Well, I mean, it was a racial thing with my parents.  My parents were freaking out, like...  They're racist? 
[03:36:30]  Well, I mean, when I went home for spring break, like, every single day, my mom's like,  I'm gonna kill myself if you don't break up with her.  Like...  She said, I'm going to kill myself if you don't break up with her.  Yeah.  She's like, big daddy.  Did you break up with her?  I'll tell you, I did break up with her about a week ago.  Because your mom was gonna kill herself?  No, that actually made me want to stay with the girl for a little bit longer.  You didn't say to the girl, I'm very much in love with you, but I do not want my mom  to commit suicide.  Nah, I just kind of told her that I was over it, and then she punched me in the face.  What?  Hard?  Yeah, she hit me right in the face. 
[03:37:00]  Wow, where?  What part?  Like, the nose?  The jaw?  Right here, right underneath.  Did she leave a mark?  Nah, she didn't, but it completely threw me off guard, because then when that happened,  I kind of fell back, and then she jumped on me, and she, like, landed on my chest with  her knees, and then backhanded me against the left eye.  What is so great about you?  Oh, he's like a white Rihanna.  What is so great about you that this girl didn't want, first, didn't want to break up  with you to the point that she's beating you because you're ending the relationship? 
[03:37:30]  What's so great about you, Alan Thicke Jr.?  I pay for everything.  Where'd you get the cash?  Your parents fund that?  Well, my parents pay for my apartment and my school, so...  So your mom's sitting there going, I am not paying you to date a brown girl.  I want to.  So, like, I have other jobs on the side, so all the money I make...  What kind of jobs?  Pimping?  Nah, I work for other radio stations, too.  Competition, huh?  Yeah, well, I mean, I don't know.  Just trying to get that guap. 
[03:38:00]  Is that right, who, kid?  That grizzle.  Grizzle, okay, I'll try to remember that.  But, like, you know, I'll just spend my extra cash on, like, you know, going out to eat  and shit.  Yeah, going out to eat shit?  Is that what you just said?  No, going out to eat and, you know, just movies and other shit.  And condoms.  And condoms.  Because you keep breaking through them, buddy.  You keep just busting them open.  I thought he was going to say he has a big dick.  That's why she's with him, but this is...  Is that what you're wondering about?  There's a monetary connection here.  Go ahead and...  Well, I mean, if you're curious, go ahead and ask.  I mean, do you have a big cock for her?  Six inches?  Okay, average. 
[03:38:30]  Average, but still, not below average.  Not below average.  Average.  A little trophy right there.  A little trophy.  Yay!  But it's a participation trophy.  It's not first place, is it?  Well, a lot of white mothers are scared of big black pussies.  That's why they don't want their sons being...  I have never heard that to be a fact.  It's a scientific fact.  Okay.  It's on a PBS.  Yeah, no, I don't think you watch PBS.  Poor Black Station is what PBS is for you.  My parents...  Keep scrolling through pictures.  Yes, sir.  Oh, my God.  Why wouldn't you have stopped at this one before?  Damn.  Okay. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, she's nice.  Yeah, the chances of you not fucking her have just decreased, haven't they, Troy?  Oh, I would hit that.  And you wouldn't mind if you found out that Troy was going to town on this girl.  Your ex from a year and a half who you were in love with at one point.  And I'd destroy it.  You would.  You'd ruin her for other men.  Oh, yeah.  She got a big mouth, too.  She does.  Pull out every trick in the book.  Oh, and that can't.  I'm sure Alan didn't show you this one.  Okay.  That's very literal and can't be comforting. 
[03:39:30]  What's her name?  Chiquita or something?  Chiquana?  You don't have to say what her name is.  Oh, sorry.  That's all right.  I mean, I don't care, but I wouldn't...  It's not like a Chiquana.  Is it Chiquana?  Is that the name?  No, no, no.  She has a very normal name.  Okay.  That's racist for you to say that Chiquana's not normal, but I'll let it slide this time.  All right.  That is racist, though.  So now we're at this point where you've broken up with your girlfriend for a year and a half,  who is this cute black chick from Texas who knows how to twerk.  Right.  She knows how to cook, too.  She's a really good cook.  Soul food?  Yeah. 
[03:40:00]  Great soul food.  What?  Love, love.  It's absolutely delicious.  Love it.  She's great.  Bad news for Alan, huh?  Yeah.  Troy will make it hurt.  Yeah.  I think so.  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah, go ahead.  I wouldn't mind if Troy did it and I just didn't know about it.  No, no, no.  You'd find out.  You'd find out.  I'd have to tell you about it.  Yeah, yeah.  And then she'd probably have to tell you about it, too.  Yeah.  Could you post it on Facebook so we'd find out that way?  Yeah, and hopefully it's on air so everybody else hears it, too.  Oh, it would be.  I mean, you would tell me, right?  Of course.  It would absolutely be on air, Alan.  I'd go into explicit details.  You would? 
[03:40:30]  Yes.  Answer all my questions.  Of course.  So you'd be okay with that?  Let's see if we can hook it up.  Is she talking to you?  Yeah, I mean.  All right, see if you can get her in here to meet Troy.  Would you do that for me?  I just want to take her out and show her a good time.  Right.  And nothing has to happen.  I just want to hang out with her.  Out of respect, don't let her suck your dick.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  All right, so.  You're going to do that, though?  I don't have that much self-respect.  Right.  Right.  I understand.  But, yeah, that seems pushing it. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah.  Even for me.  Yeah.  I don't know.  You seem like a fun dude.  I mean, like, I'm married.  Yeah.  You know, I'm married.  Very much in love with my wife.  Yeah.  And I've been with her for eight years.  So, to say I'm over all of my exes is an understatement.  Right.  I wouldn't put any of them in contact with Troy.  Not one.  Alan.  Yeah.  It would bother me if Troy was having sex with my exes.  And I'm married and very much in love with my wife. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah.  And I've been away from them for way more than a week and a half.  And none of them know how to twerk.  Yeah, but Alan and I are bros.  I mean, Alan's a fun guy.  I'm not that fun of a guy.  We're cool.  If I can be honest about myself, sometimes I've got to stick up my ass.  What can I say?  Right.  You know?  And that's me.  At least I'm self-aware enough to admit that.  You're more of a fun guy, huh?  Alan?  Yeah, but.  Yeah, okay.  All right, cool.  Troy would do it and then do it so that he could destroy me and demoralize me and cause me personal pain. 
[03:42:00]  No, I think more of his motivation would be to get a nut than any of that.  I just want to bust.  Is that right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, if you want to just bust and I don't figure out, then I'll quit.  No, no, no, no.  And then afterwards.  That's the problem.  Just don't bust in their mouth.  Right.  Respecting, man.  Wow.  Right.  It's fun to bust in the mouth, so that's.  I mean, who can even you know that?  Even you know that.  You know, I don't know.  It's all about respect, man.  Let's go to Anthony in Minnesota.  What's up, Anthony? 
[03:42:30]  Hey, I want to get one of them mixtapes.  All right, I'm going to put you on hold.  Thank you.  Moisture.  Let's go to Rebecca in New Jersey.  Hey.  How are you?  I'm very good.  How are you?  Good.  Good.  I'm trying to get one of those mixtapes as well.  All right, you get one.  Stay on hold.  Thank you.  Moisture.  Rebecca gets one, too, Eric.  All right, so you break up with this chick.  Now you're still hanging out with her friends for whatever reason.  It's just incestuous and not.  There's no reason.  They're not fucking the friends. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah.  There's no reason.  He says this chick is, like, crazy and mean to him.  Why would you do it?  Yeah.  I mean, it'd be one thing if, like, she was, like, the friend was sort of looking at you  and sort of saying things to you.  It's like, all right, I'm going to break up with this bitch and I'm going to smash you.  No, no.  She, like, she's told me, like, she's incredibly unattractive to me.  So what the fuck are you hanging out with her for?  I don't have any other friends.  Hang out by your make-a-friend.  How?  I don't know how.  Stop being such a fucking idiot.  That's how.  Yeah, I can start doing that.  You know what I mean?  Well, he's not pussy because he don't care if Troy fuck his girl. 
[03:43:30]  So he gets the black respect.  Yeah.  No, but I think he's lying about not caring.  He thinks so?  I think so.  Yeah.  Nah.  You don't think so?  Seriously?  Nah.  You're not a pussy, are you?  I'm not a pussy.  A little bit?  Not a vagina, are you?  Like, isn't it a little pussy to be like, I don't have any friends, so I hang out with  my ex's friends and they don't like me, but I hang out with them because I don't have  any friends.  That's a little pussy, right?  That's a little fallopian tube right there.  Okay, okay.  I mean, I didn't really have much time to, like, hang out with anybody, like, the past 
[03:44:00]  year and a half I dated her, so.  Right.  Well, people don't like you.  You're very abrasive.  Right.  What can you do?  So, you're hanging out with this chick.  Her neck starts swelling up because she used hair dye.  Right.  Oh, shit.  And this is 2 o'clock in the morning.  This was the night before.  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, the reason we're having this conversation is to find out why  Alan was late today, of course.  I mean, that's our pure motivation.  I met up with her at around 9 o'clock.  Right.  Right after I left class because I was waiting for this girl, my ex-girlfriend, to come meet 
[03:44:30]  up with me because we're going to have dinner that night.  Why?  Because there's no friends.  Is that it?  Yeah, that's why, pretty much.  And so...  Oh, wait.  It's 9 o'clock at night.  9 o'clock at night.  What time do you wake up in the morning?  I usually get up at around 4.15.  Did you ever think to yourself, it's 9 o'clock.  Maybe what I could do tonight is go home at 9 and go to sleep and then wake up at 4.15.  I do think that.  But...  But you didn't.  But the problem was I took like a six-hour nap before I went to class. 
[03:45:00]  Smart.  Right.  So I guess I went to...  I slept like right after I left work here yesterday because I was just exhausted.  Yeah.  Well, not just after, but go on.  So...  That's weird shit right there.  During a little bit, too.  But go on.  So...  I was just waiting and when my ex-girlfriend finally met up with us over at the chick's  apartment, the one who got the hair dye.  This was the ex-girlfriend who a week ago punched you in the face for breaking up with  her.  Right.  You're going to sit down to dinner. 
[03:45:30]  Right.  Right.  Are you still fucking her?  A little bit?  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit.  Any broken condoms or...  No, no.  We've been using the pill for the last couple of months.  So no condoms at all?  No condoms at all.  Good for you.  Raw dogging.  You put your blast inside?  Yeah.  No pulling out?  No pulling out.  It's a risky scenario.  Yeah, 99.98% effective.  You're good with it, huh?  I'm good with it.  All right.  I can deal with the .02%.  Right.  Because you just...  I mean...  Would you pay for an abortion if need be?  You would.  I would.  Good for you. 
[03:46:00]  It's a classy move.  It's a classy move.  And don't pull a Damone where you tell her you'll pay for half and give her a ride and  then never show up.  Be a man, you know?  Why are we playing this?  I feel like I'm in a Dawson's Creek episode.  Yeah, I don't know.  Now we're going to Wallflowers.  I think we're losing focus on what's going on.  Eric's having fun in there.  He's having one of his Eric moments.  I don't mind the music.  It's just like the Wallflowers.  Eric sometimes likes to flex his creativity this way by just throwing on weird music.  But go rock it.  E-Rock, you're doing your thing in there. 
[03:46:30]  I feel like I'm laying in a lake or something.  E-Rock does the sex bagel show in there.  It's kind of a show that doesn't exist on the air.  It's in his own little head.  And he's just having a great time.  So let it happen.  It's simultaneously existing with After Opie and Anthony Live.  So, sit down to dinner.  You got your ex who punched you in the face a week ago because you broke up with her.  But you've been fucking her for the last week anyway.  Yeah.  And you're now having dinner with her. 
[03:47:00]  Generally, when you have an ex, Troy, do you have sex and go out to dinner with them?  Or does that make them kind of not your ex?  It depends.  If an ex is that fucking crazy.  If an ex is cool, you know what I mean?  Sometimes it ends on good terms and you're like, ah, you know, we're cool.  Let's smash.  But you continue to fuck and date.  No, not date.  You're going to dinner.  It goes from dating to just hanging out.  Yeah.  We just hang out.  You're just hanging out.  You're just being casual.  If she's that crazy, it's like, I needed some time apart.  Right.  Like more than a week?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Like months go by where she cools off and just goes, all right, we're cool. 
[03:47:30]  And your mom would probably prefer that not only you break up with this girl, but you stop sticking your dick in her.  And busting in her.  Yeah.  True.  This probably really hurts his mom.  Are you talking about the black pussy or some new white pussy?  No, black one.  The black one.  No, my mom wants me to be with a white girl.  Yeah.  Yeah, no.  Sexually.  Well, I mean, just in any kind of respect.  She didn't tell you about the big black vaginas?  Okay.  Again, I think you might be making that up.  She told me that. 
[03:48:00]  That's what I heard.  Word up.  Word up indeed.  So, the three of you are at dinner.  Right.  Well, the girl who dyed her hair just finished eating dinner.  I was just waiting for my ex-girlfriend to come meet up with me.  Sure.  And I was just waiting at this apartment because it's pretty much on the way to her place anyways.  Sure.  So, I said, text me when you get here so that we can go out, so we can go to your place together.  Right.  But in the meantime, I found out that this girl's neck was...  Swollen.  Yeah.  And so, we hung out with her for a little bit until we decided to, you know, take her to the hospital. 
[03:48:30]  And your ex was there?  Yeah.  So, why didn't your ex just take her to the hospital?  Because I just bought, like, a bunch of groceries.  I got...  Okay.  I don't know what...  That answer seems to not at all relate to the question I just asked you.  I realized...  I mean, you could have...  Maybe it was Taco Day.  Maybe whatever it was.  It was Taco Day.  Okay.  So, you bought taco supplies.  Yeah.  So, obviously, you had to go to the hospital with her.  Well, it was weird.  I did have the groceries with me when I went to the hospital.  Yeah.  Why?  Why?  Because I needed to wait until I got to... 
[03:49:00]  Why did you go to the hospital with her?  Because I wasn't going to leave her alone.  But your ex was with them.  Yeah.  But I was going to eat the tacos with my ex.  At the hospital?  Well, no.  We were going to go to the apartment, but we decided we would wait at the hospital until...  Why did you and...  This is not making any sense.  Why did you and your ex go to the hospital?  Why didn't your ex and that girl just go on their own, and then you go home and be like,  well, I have an internship that I have to wake up for?  Because my ex picked up the groceries.  I paid for half. 
[03:49:30]  And...  Back to the groceries.  Yeah.  And...  Can you put it back on a good picture?  I'm sorry.  Oh, yeah.  Sorry about that.  Yeah.  I don't know why you cleared out of it.  Soon.  Don't move.  And maybe occasionally just scroll through so I can see some other ones.  But go on.  Oh, there you are with her.  Better times, huh?  Yeah.  Better times.  Is he eating pussy?  Look at you guys.  So tell me.  Why are you going to the hospital?  I mean, I don't know.  It would have felt dick to just, you know, leave her there.  Yeah, but you know what was dick? 
[03:50:00]  What?  7 o'clock in the morning, you show up here.  Yeah.  And everybody's like, oh, cool.  We've been here since 5.  No, I felt...  Is your ex-girlfriend here going to help you get a job?  That's a great question.  Yeah.  Like, are you going to be a professional dude who fucks black chicks?  Or a professional fucking hair dyer,  take people to the hospital?  A professional condom breaker?  Is the chick that you took to the hospital,  she going to help you get a job?  Yeah.  No.  Are you going to be somebody who creates awareness for Plan B, 
[03:50:30]  the morning after pill?  That'd be kind of cool.  You're aware of it?  I'm aware of it.  She's got nice legs.  God damn.  Look at her.  He's being a professional.  Go back, go back, go back.  He is, isn't he?  He is an n-word.  No.  He is, right?  No, trust me.  Yellow dress.  Look at that.  She's cute.  So, what time did you get home?  About 2, 2.30.  Okay, so you're home at 2.30.  Yeah.  And then you didn't figure,  I'll just stay up because I can't,  I'm not an adult who can wake up at an appropriate time.  I wanted to stay up. 
[03:51:00]  And what happened?  Well, I was, I went, I went to the black girl's, my ex-girlfriend's apartment because it's  right next to the hospital.  And I just, and she was just like, look, you're not, I'll wake up, I'll hear your alarm too.  Well, I'll just wake you up when it's time for you to go to work.  And I've done it like a hundred times before.  Well, you've been late before too.  I've been late before too.  Right.  So, I wouldn't say, I mean, you've, you've been on, you were late for instance, Wednesday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  That was two days ago. 
[03:51:30]  Yeah.  So to say I've been on time a hundred times before, that would only be accurate to say  you, you've been late 50 times before.  Is that fair?  I wouldn't say that.  I mean, I've been late.  You can count it on two hands.  Okay.  That's a lot of times to be late.  You haven't been here that many times.  Yeah.  It's only a matter of a few months.  I'm late here.  Is he in trouble or something?  Well.  Are you going to whip him?  I'm trying to get to, okay, why do you think we've been having this conversation?  Oh, okay.  I want to make sure.  I thought it was about the black pussy.  I didn't know.  I was late.  No, that had nothing to do with it. 
[03:52:00]  That was just a complete sidetrack conversation.  It's a bit of shit.  Yeah.  So, why wouldn't you say, how about you and I just spend the next hour and a half getting  our fuck out for a little while?  You know?  I don't think I have that kind of confidence.  You don't?  Nah.  You don't have the stamina?  Hell, man.  No, I'm just, I don't know.  I mean, tongue her that, like, hey, let's get our fuck out.  Did you say tonguing her?  No, telling her.  Telling, okay. 
[03:52:30]  Telling her.  You could understand why I heard that, right?  Who could?  I think.  You heard it too, right, Roland?  Roland has good ears.  Terrible at talking, but he can hear well.  He has a little moisture in his mouth.  He does.  He usually does.  I don't know how it gets it in there.  Tasty.  Go on.  Go on, Alan.  Like, I had trouble getting laid when we were dating.  How is that possible?  You were dating somebody.  How could you have trouble getting laid?  I don't know.  That's the only reason to date somebody, is they will lay you. 
[03:53:00]  Yeah, it didn't really happen that often.  Like, when you say, I have trouble getting laid, it would mean nobody will date me.  Like, once you have a girlfriend, you're not supposed to have trouble getting laid.  And if you don't get laid, it's how you go, just find a new one.  Right.  It's like, okay, so I have a buddy, you know, who makes me buy things for them.  Yeah, no, that's...  I would not be that person's buddy anymore.  Would you, Troy?  Nope.  It didn't really happen that often.  I remember there was a period where we didn't even do it for a month.  It was driving me insane.  Fuck, how old are you?  I mean, what, are you 20 years old? 
[03:53:30]  What's the problem?  Huh?  What's the problem?  She doesn't want to fuck you?  Sometimes.  But, I mean, she was just like...  You got that healthy six-inch dong in your pants.  Somebody's got to use it, Alan.  Real shit.  She's black.  Black girls are always horny.  Is that right?  Yeah, right?  Who kid?  It's been years.  I mean, who kid doesn't know?  He has no idea.  He's a traitor.  Tango.  Yeah, I really can't explain it.  Do you think she was getting it on the side?  Nah, I don't...  She was just always exhausted from work because, like, you know...  What does she do?  Without being too specific. 
[03:54:00]  She's a clerk at a law clinic.  Okay.  Yeah.  And that exhausts her.  Yeah, because she hates all the people she works with.  They're always, like, complete assholes to her, so...  But why couldn't she come home and get that stress relieved, if you know what I mean?  She would rather just, like, you know, lie in bed and order, uh, you know, Chinese food.  She sounds like a riot.  Yeah.  Do you think maybe you just weren't drilling her good?  I mean...  Like, if you were laying it down, great.  She's like, I need that dick.  Ooh, uh. 
[03:54:30]  Could that have been in?  Yeah.  I mean...  Were you very experienced before her, or was this kind of a...  I lost my virginity to her.  Good for you, Alan.  Get the fuck out of here.  Good for you.  It's a beautiful story.  It's great.  I didn't get laid in high school at all.  I know what that's like.  Yeah, it's...  It's a tough thing.  Yeah.  It's a tough thing.  I wasn't getting laid in high school.  Not until the very end.  Yeah.  Who Kid lost his virginity at 24?  No, man.  19, man.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Fucking God, man.  24.  19, though.  Okay, and this is a guy who now just goes around the world and puts his penis into women. 
[03:55:00]  Fuck bitches.  Fuck bitches.  You know what he does?  He cheats on his wife constantly.  All the time.  You know when he lost his virginity?  19!  Okay, Alan, this is a success story.  This is the same thing as you.  You lost your virginity in 1920.  Right.  So did Who Kid.  He was a fucking nerd.  I believe I had pimples and shit.  You ain't got no pimples, yo.  Yeah.  You're not even a bad looking dude.  Nicole from the mashup said you were a good looking guy.  Oh, that must have given you quite a thrill then when she said that.  Yeah, I did.  You get a little excited? 
[03:55:30]  Yeah, I jerked off when I went home.  Did you?  Did you jerk off thinking of her?  Yeah, I did.  Is that a true story?  Well, I'm not gonna...  Well, fuck.  I probably shouldn't have said that, should I?  No, it's cool.  Don't worry about it.  I would have done the same thing.  Well, yeah, I'm gonna tell her.  But this is a safe place.  All right.  You did, right?  Secret, yeah, of course.  Wait a minute.  I jerked off and went home.  That means he did it here?  Did you...  Oh, jerk off and then go home?  Yeah.  Did you jerk off here or at home?  No, I went home.  But you went home and you thought about Nicole saying that she would bang you.  That's hot.  Well, I was thinking about it on the way home and then, you know, went to Pornhub.  That's what I'm talking about.  But what got you excited? 
[03:56:00]  Yeah.  That's a great story.  That's hot.  It was also my birthday when she told me that.  Oh, man.  So it was just like a huge, like, compilation of just like, yes.  So on your birthday, you masturbated to Nicole from the mashup instead of having sex with  your black girlfriend who twerks.  Yeah.  Well, I was really sick that day and it was a blizzard.  I don't know.  I mean, yeah, but you were not sick enough to get off, obviously.  Yeah.  I mean, I do it because it's medical.  I respect this guy.  Yeah. 
[03:56:30]  You have respect for him, Hootkid.  I go up to Nicole all the time.  You do?  Good for you, Hootkid.  Good for you.  You don't think you could seal a deal?  Nicole?  Yeah.  Yeah, she got a nice mouth.  I would do it.  Okay.  All right.  Good for you.  Good for you, Hootkid.  Nicole's on her way.  She is.  Oh, shit.  She got a hard pussy but an easy mouth.  Can I talk about my bit when she comes in and just, like, not make any reference?  All right.  No, this is better than your bit.  No, I'll tell you, Eric, let's be fair.  When Nicole gets in, we won't make any mention of the fact that Alan Master made it to her.  I don't want him to get all upset, you know. 
[03:57:00]  I mean, I don't want to.  Keep flipping.  I don't want to do that to you, Alan.  The big question is, did he get a head from his black girl the first time you lost to Virginia, and did you give her head?  Okay.  You know, she doesn't like getting anybody going down on her.  That's just not her thing.  Serious?  You know what that means.  God.  First of all, that's a black man's paradise.  And second of all, it means it hasn't been done right.  No.  Is that right, Troy?  Yeah.  I've been told that.  You know why?  Because every girl I've ever been with has said the same thing.  I'm kidding. 
[03:57:30]  I'm joking.  I'm joking.  That was a little self-deprecation.  Go back, go back, go back.  Did you try?  Did you attempt to go down on her?  Yeah.  She's just like, nah, it's weird.  Don't do it.  Oof.  So.  That's a terrible thing to hear.  Did she go down on you?  Yeah.  How'd she do?  Get the fuck out of here.  All right.  All right.  Not great.  Not great.  Well, you've never had it from anybody else.  I mean, I've had it from other people, but I've never.  But how?  Did you cheat on her?  No.  I guess when you fuck.  Nicole, I'm so glad you're here.  How are you today?  I'm good. 
[03:58:00]  I feel so important getting a call at my desk.  Please.  You need to be at the after show ASAP.  You look wonderful to Alan.  You remember Alan.  Look at that mouth.  Yes.  Cutie patootie Alan.  What did you say about Alan?  He was very handsome and I would probably do him.  You did.  If I wasn't married.  Alan, does that make you excited?  Yeah.  It made me really excited.  Do you mind?  I know I said I wouldn't, but I feel the thing is, Nicole and me have a very deep friendship  and we care about each other very deeply.  Deeply.  Yeah.  We've shared so much information.  Yeah.  And I'm at a crush room.  Troy, you understand I'm at a crush room. 
[03:58:30]  What's about to happen to me?  No, no, no.  Don't worry.  I told Alan that I wouldn't tell you what he, but now I feel like I need to tell you.  He's blushing.  What are you going to say?  Don't embarrass him.  Can I tell her?  Is that okay?  You're going to tell her.  But keep fighting.  But I don't want to have lied to you.  Can I tell her?  Because we're friends and I want everybody in here.  Real appears.  Real.  Real.  To kind of be in the truth circle.  Is that cool, Alan?  It's cool.  Is this the real talk right now?  I want you to know that Alan, a week ago, he broke up with his girlfriend of a year and  a half. 
[03:59:00]  I didn't know if you were dating someone.  She was a black girl who twerks.  Wow.  It's very exciting.  She would teach me.  This is the girl he lost his virginity to.  Oh!  Unfortunately, she didn't have a lot of sex with him for large chunks of their relationship.  That's not very nice.  And I want you to know that the day that you said I would do him, and this is a guy who  didn't get laid in high school, okay?  So I want you to know on the day that you said you would do him, it excited him quite  a bit.  Oh, no.  And I need you to know that at that point he went home and he pleasured himself to that 
[03:59:30]  thought.  That's fine.  That's fine.  There's nothing wrong with that.  I don't think there's anything wrong with it either.  That's the power of the mind.  I mean, I can't say that I wouldn't do the same thing.  Wait, does your girlfriend or your ex-girlfriend know that?  Why would I tell her that?  I know.  Well, she probably knows now.  Yeah.  What exactly did you think of?  Did you think of, like, a position?  Like, were you having sex with her in a position?  Or was she...  Like, what were you doing with her?  Nicole.  I wasn't...  I wasn't fan...  Like, it was just something that kind of get me going, and then I flipped on a porn, 
[04:00:00]  and that's where my mind was at.  I didn't...  So it wasn't really about me.  I think it was.  I mean, I might have gotten the engine going, but the porn had finished off.  We would have gotten a little further if you weren't here with this question,  but...  So, you...  But were you thinking of doing something with Nicole?  When you watch the porn...  Yeah.  Are you thinking...  Because a lot of times when you watch porn, you put yourself in that movie, don't you?  Hell yeah.  Of course.  You do, right?  Who, kid?  All the time.  Were you maybe thinking of you in the role of the male, and maybe it was Nicole from the  mash-up in the role of the female? 
[04:00:30]  Moisture.  And that's got to flatter you, Nicole.  Yes, absolutely.  There's nothing wrong with this.  It's complimentary.  Yes, absolutely.  That's what I tried to tell him.  I can't do the whole, like, mind role-play thing.  I know a lot of guys pretend that they're, you know, the penis in the porn, but I...  Penis in the porn.  I don't...  What the hell?  I don't have that kind of, like, you know, stamina or self-respect.  I'm Alan, the penis.  Hello, everybody.  What's going on?  Some guys pretend they're every part, not just the penis.  Right.  So, I don't know.  It's dark in here.  It's just something I watch and appreciate, you know? 
[04:01:00]  Right, right.  Well, I mean, yeah, you're not the most imaginative dude.  Like, you don't have, like, the strongest brain capacity type of thing going on.  Is that right?  Look, I look.  He's so mean.  No, it's not a mean thing.  He's cool.  Keep flipping.  Yeah, right.  He's scrolling through pictures of his ex for Troy to look at.  Oh, you're looking...  Oh, you don't know what she looks like?  I'd like to know she looks like.  No, she's hot.  Take a look at the...  I wish I knew her.  I know.  I feel sort of honored.  Mm-hmm.  You should. 
[04:01:30]  I feel really honored.  I mean, I wish that...  I wish I was more a part of it, to be completely honest.  I think...  Can I tell you the truth?  Yeah.  Stop.  I feel like you were a pretty big part of it.  And then he's covering it up with the porn?  Oh, go back.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't think the porn had much to do with it.  Okay.  All right.  I hope that that's the case, to be completely honest.  And I want you to know that Alan is a man, okay?  Yeah, he's a man's man.  This is a guy who broke condoms while having sex with his girlfriend.  Okay?  I love that.  Okay, this is a guy.  He's a solid six inches, which means he may be six and a half, because I think he's underestimating 
[04:02:00]  himself, to tell you the truth.  It's amazing.  Yeah, it is, isn't it?  What's that?  I haven't used a condom in so long.  You haven't.  It almost sounds fun.  It doesn't.  Right?  A condom would just be a thrilling thing.  Something I haven't done in a long time.  Have you used a condom ever?  Yes!  I'm asking.  I'm asking.  I've slept with many, many men.  No, I know that.  I know that.  So, of course I use a condom.  I'm not, like, I'm not an animal.  Okay, that wasn't obvious.  Troy, would you say that Nicole using condoms in her past was obvious or no?  I mean, I'm sure she's had lots of partners. 
[04:02:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That I was sure about.  The condom thing, I wasn't.  Right.  Totally.  So, eventually, somebody along the way has to wear a condom.  At least.  A few of them.  Just odds-wise.  Yes.  You know, I mean, just in terms of sheer numbers.  I mean, there's been a few mistakes, like, whoopsie.  Right.  But, you know, for the most part, I was very good about it.  Drinks don't have a condom?  Well, whatever.  Yeah, just stick it in anyways.  Right.  It's fine.  You've been there.  Don't worry, I'll pull out.  Totally been there.  You've been there.  Totally.  You've lived a life.  Thankfully, I've made it, and I've been tested 15 million times, and I don't have anything. 
[04:03:00]  So, you've been in a situation where it's like, do you have a condom?  The guy goes, no.  And you're like, well, at least I asked.  At least I tried.  Right.  The old E for effort.  You are.  You're just a walking after-school special.  But you're the before part.  Yes.  You're not the happy ending.  Not at all.  No.  Not even a little bit.  You're the bad girl.  Yeah.  You're the terrible influence.  I asked him about your mouth, you know, because your mouth turns everybody on.  It turns everybody on.  Who gets said he's jerked off to you many times?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  This is like the most amazing day of my life. 
[04:03:30]  I'm about to put a condom on anyway.  Congratulations.  Protect myself.  Just sit here.  Congratulations.  Oh, my God.  This is the most.  I mean, you made my day.  You made my weekend.  This is what it's about.  I love this.  Everybody appreciating your beauty.  I wish people would call up and tell me they also have jerked off to me, because that  would make my...  They will.  I mean, what's your Twitter?  At Mashup Nicole.  Let her know if you've jerked off to her.  It's hard to know.  Where's that picture of Nicole on the motorcycle?  Isn't there a hot picture?  There's a good one, but it's from a long time ago.  If you just Google, you can probably find it.  Because we need to give some of the guys some fodder. 
[04:04:00]  Some fodder?  Yeah.  I think Drew doesn't need it.  Where are you going?  Where are you going?  I thought you wanted to look it up.  No, no, no.  You're just staring at his ex-girlfriend?  Yeah.  He's about the fucker.  I feel like that's kind of inappropriate.  I'm trying to fuck her.  Alan, I want you to know the point of this whole conversation was to get to the fact that  earlier on on the show today, while the guys were talking about  Valley Girl with the great Dave Attell, who's hilarious every single fucking time he comes  in this room.  He's unbelievable.  I got to be privy to the E-Rock show that happens while O&A is on that nobody gets to listen 
[04:04:30]  to because I was sitting in the studio and I heard in my headphones, hey, Sam.  And I'm just like, what am I going to say?  Yes, I'm on the air.  And he goes, turn around.  It's E-Rock's voice.  He goes, turn around.  Look through the window.  Because E-Rock is a window away.  And I go, okay.  And I turn around and I see Alan is dead to the world.  Alan. 
[04:05:00]  Because he was two hours late today.  Alan, you need to have some coffee in the morning or something.  He's dead to the world.  He's in his winter hat.  I told him not to wear his hat and jacket indoors because he gets warm.  He gets comfortable.  He falls asleep.  Maybe you should give drugs a try.  Just give you a little pep in your step.  Something to keep you awake.  Something.  Jeez.  I mean, you don't see Nicole sleeping on the job.  I don't know why.  I don't either, actually.  But she's not sleeping on the job.  Alan is dead to the world.  And I watch as E-Rock and Sal.  Couldn't care less about what's going on in the studio, by the way. 
[04:05:30]  E-Rock is pointing his cell phone camera at him.  And Sal screams in Alan's ear and watches him jump and wakes up.  It's funny.  It's hilarious.  I should videotape that.  That happens to you a lot around here, Alan?  Yeah, more times than I'd like to admit.  Yeah.  Sleepy guy.  Troy told me he caught you twice.  On when?  Yesterday?  Yeah.  Twice.  Yeah.  He's sleepy from jerking off to me, hopefully.  Is that what it was?  Sleepy from jerking off.  That's exactly what it was.  It does tire you out a little bit, doesn't it? 
[04:06:00]  Alan, from now on, I want you to only jerk off to Nicole before 5.30 p.m.  Can you do that for me?  Yeah.  Jerk off to Nicole.  In fact, every night.  I'll give you 6.15 p.m. every night.  I want you to jerk off to Nicole, and then I'll tucker you out.  Yeah.  You can go to sleep at a reasonable hour, and then you can come in fresh, ready to work  with your pipes clean.  Will you do that for me?  I'll do that for you.  Alan, you've been great today. 
[04:06:30]  Fabulous worker.  Nicole, you've been great.  Hey, anytime.  If you want a mixtape, email djwhokidmp3 at gmail.com with your address.  You're not really helping my email.  Is it blowing up?  I've got like 5,000 fucking requests.  And Troy, where will you be?  I'm DJing tonight at Los Feliz in New York City, and then tomorrow I'll be in Philadelphia  DJing at Rumor.  So come out.  All right.  I see you, dude.  Check it out.  Can I come out tomorrow at the greenhouse?  Greenhouse.  Tomorrow, Who Kid will be there.  All the bitches will be there.  If they're not in Philly, see me, DJ.  The New York bitches with Who Kid, the Philly bitches with Troy Kwan. 
[04:07:00]  We'll see you on Monday.  Ron and Fezzer next.  Goodbye.  Closing time.  Time for you to go out to the places you will be from.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time. </pre>
