<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with the hosts' usual crude humor and boasts about their radio longevity.  They quickly pivoted to a news story about a Carnival cruise ship losing power, resulting in passengers receiving Spam and Pop-Tarts from the Navy.  This led to a discussion comparing various cruise lines, focusing on the lavish amenities of a Norwegian Cruise Line's "Epic" ship (central park, bowling alley, ice bar, roller coaster), with a caller sharing their personal experience.  The conversation then shifted to public health campaigns, specifically New York City's anti-soup campaign and proposed graphic warnings on cigarette packs, prompting cynical commentary and anecdotes from the hosts and a caller who had quit smoking.  A caller recounted a frightening encounter at a dangerous gas station situated on a highway median strip, sparking further discussion about reckless drivers and the gas station's location.  A news tease about a woman possibly having to share her home with her near-stabber transitioned into a disgusted discussion of a pedophilia guide found on Amazon; the hosts read excerpts.  The show announced upcoming guests Patrice O'Neal and Brett Ratner, and teased a call with Alex Jones.  A Bill Hicks bit about smoking concluded this segment.

The next segment began with a comedian's pre-show anxieties and a discussion about the cruise ship incident, contrasting the passengers' experience with the hardships faced by sailors in the past.  The conversation meandered to a mysterious Pentagon/NASA plume, speculated to be a missile or UFO, followed by an absurd discussion about a listener's suggested restaurant dish ("Rooty Tooty Fresh and Fruity") that spiraled into an enthusiastic debate about bacon, culminating in the hosts' desire to cook bacon on air.  Madonna's appearance on Ellen DeGeneres' show to discuss bullying was critiqued, deemed a publicity stunt, and sparked a lengthy debate on bullying, teen suicide, and generational differences in handling bullying, with the hosts and guests sharing often offensive anecdotes.  Brett Ratner joined in studio, alongside Patrice O'Neal, leading to discussions about fast food (particularly the McRib and its marketing to Black audiences), Ratner's movie *Skyline* (its low budget, impressive visual effects, and alien invasion plot), and the film's trailer.

Brett Ratner continued to discuss *Skyline*, emphasizing its production value and visual effects.  He shared anecdotes about his career, including almost directing *Superman* and working with Chris Tucker.  The conversation expanded to speculation about aliens, their motives, and existence. The hosts joked about their reactions to an alien invasion.  The discussion then returned to the mysterious plume sighting, with Alex Jones joining via phone.  Jones offered a skeptical counter-narrative, suggesting a Chinese or North Korean missile test, connecting it to global economic tensions and Cold War-style brinkmanship.  He mentioned his work with Jesse Ventura and upcoming episodes about FEMA camps.  A humorous digression into a discussion of Kesha's physique concluded this segment.

The final segment heavily featured Alex Jones, focusing on conspiracy theories.  Jones discussed his film "Police State for the Rise of FEMA," alleging the existence and purpose of FEMA camps. He claimed to have been a former governor and Navy SEAL, recounting alleged denials of access to these camps and a nuclear reactor.  He presented theories about Plum Island's alleged bioweapons labs, linking them to the Rockefeller Foundation and globalist agendas.  He connected these to movies like James Bond and *The Wizard of Oz*, suggesting coded messages.  Jones discussed 9/11, alleging CIA involvement and citing declassified documents and whistleblowers.  He discussed the alleged government use of memos, creation and spread of bioweapons, and the health effects of fluoride and Bisphenol A. The hosts and Jones engaged in humorous banter, interruptions, and overlapping conversations.  A brief discussion about a Jesse Ventura parody video and a Carbonite commercial concluded the show.

[00:01:00]  they'll tone them back in well i guess that's an easy one they lost all power  yeah they carnival cruise i guess they had some kind of fire in the engine room  and um whoopsie daisy all the power went out  that engine runs not just the ship  all the generators and all that fun stuff so uh  so what happened to the food  they didn't have electricity they didn't have  well they had no way to prepare because they didn't have electricity  and then they didn't have uh hot water  so they can't wash things and 
[00:01:30]  so there was big problems there  but uh thank god the uss ronald reagan  the aircraft carrier was there to uh airlift in some gourmet food  oh yeah what did they get  yes uh spam and pop tarts  that's uh  they could they could airlift in anything  and they decided on spam and pop tarts  they went with what was called the uh e-rock menu  uh of spam and pop tarts  you think e-rock's bummed he wasn't on that particular cruise ship 
[00:02:00]  because e-rock goes on a lot of cruise he likes cruises  he's he's the man what is he a gold member or a platinum  platinum gold fucking  oh it's whatever  just amazing  yeah  but uh yeah he probably is upset he missed the spam and pop tart cruise  that's too bad  and they're uh they're towing the ship into san diego  when are they going to get to san diego  i don't know but they've uh opened the bars up for um complimentary drinks  which is great now have a drunk a bunch of drunk angry people 
[00:02:30]  eating spam and pop tarts  spam and pop tarts  you know what those fucking  those hallways must smell like  oh my god  spam and pop tart farts  why spam  all over the  i guess that's the easiest thing for um  to airlift in  besides  yeah i guess they didn't want to send mres into the uh  obviously  you know drop it on the deck  here you go  here's some  freeze-dried ice cream  sure  obviously they don't want them eating too much  yeah yeah  you know force them to maybe nibble at the spam a little bit 
[00:03:00]  before they get to san diego  no  and what are they giving these people a free cruise  i guess they just give them a free cruise  but it's like  well i was on a cruise  and it went horribly bad  i'm never doing a cruise ship again  yeah  i paid for it  yeah  and it's  it's all fucked up  so now i just get another cruise  i don't get my money  but do they get their money back  and a free cruise  or do they just get another cruise  oh they get their money back  thumbs up  and  for their  hassle  they're giving them a  another free cruise  a free cruise 
[00:03:30]  all right  to make up for it  there they are  just  eating pop tarts to this  trying to be all festive still  yeah come on everybody  you know the ship people are probably still like  yeah  come on  did you enjoy your pop tarts and spam everyone  yeah  look the blenders aren't working  so we don't have nice banana daiquiris and stuff  but uh  i guess we could pop open some uh  bottles of  bud light  it's bothersome that  you lose electricity for 
[00:04:00]  i don't know  a day  and all hell breaks loose  yeah  they don't have that shit figured out  uh  like all the food goes bad  after the electricity goes out  for just a short period of time  yeah i guess they couldn't uh  keep it on ice  and uh  they  they couldn't cook it  so yeah  it probably went bad  and  and uh  they can't wash the dishes  and sanitation  but to be  the sanitary conditions on cruise ships  are very important  because uh  the spread of disease  is very rapid on those ships 
[00:04:30]  uh  especially if you have  spam and  pop tart shits  no working toilets  oh my  yeah  oh my  yeah  yo all that shit works on electric pumps  and and everything  so they had no uh  nothing  no running water  they finally got cold running water  they didn't have hot running water  so  you got a bunch of stinky people  and how long have they been  uh  in these conditions  a couple of days  a couple of days  uh  they're slowly towing them back  they were out in the pacific  that was somebody's vacation 
[00:05:00]  yeah  i mean  they planned  probably more than a year  i heard uh  on local news  that there are some elderly people  from yonkers  that were on that ship  i just throw them overboard  so they're probably  yeah  just uh  sharks are hungry too  they  they probably were just  complaining  i don't know  and no telephone service  which is a big thing  on the cruise  costs a lot of money  when you're out at sea  but you can  just pick your phone up  in your room  and dial out  call home  and stuff like that  so they had no communication 
[00:05:30]  with home  i of course  when i go on a cruise  take my satellite phone  i'm not uh  gonna be incommunicado  because of uh  uh  somebody else's problems  my friend  you'll always have  a way of communicating  paranoid anthony  will always be able  to communicate  yeah well  that's one of the  big stories today  whatever  it happens  yeah  and that's your  you know  carnival  please come on  carnival's not uh  if you've been on cruises  you kinda know 
[00:06:00]  carnival is the lower tier  of cruise lines  is that true  eroc  you're the expert  yeah that's for people  in college  that don't have a lot  of money  and just  it's pretty much  a booze cruise  yeah  it's like  it's a cruise ship  but it might as well  be one of those  ferries  oh yeah  yeah they just  pack in as many  people as they can  uh  get them out there  and uh  you know  your basic  the food  oh really  yeah royal caribbean  is the shit  uh  even norwegian 
[00:06:30]  cruise lines  is uh  really good  their new ship  is awesome  the epic  the royal caribbean  no the uh  norwegian  oh norwegian  yeah yeah  what is the epic  all about  it's  i think  if it's not  the biggest  it's the second  biggest  ship uh  uh  in the world  they did a huge  concert  for fourth of  july  nbc had it uh  docked right here  off the side of  manhattan  oh i saw it  from my window  this thing  you can do a  concert in the  back of the  ship with a  huge uh  hd screen  it looks like a  skyscraper on 
[00:07:00]  its side  this thing is  so fucking  big  is it really  yes  oh good  yeah well  i'll be going  on that in  april  oh you're doing  the epic  you want to do  that presidential  suite  i uh  i couldn't get  the presidential  suite  but i got the  next one down  there's only like  four of them on  the ship  if i remember  correctly the  presidential suite  the tv comes  out of the bed  well isn't that  nice  jizz all over it  yeah that epic  ship is massive  what do they have 
[00:07:30]  on it what are  the stats  it's uh  everything  they just have  everything on  shove the mall  in the middle  of it  it's got that  disco blacklight  bowling alley in  there it's got a  central park through  the center of  the ship  yeah it's like  a whole uh  what do you mean  central park  there's usually an  atrium right  in the middle of  the ship you know  it's kind of thin  not thin but  they've they've  figured out a way  to just wide open  the middle  they actually have  rooms now that  overlook the  middle of the ship  and not even the  outside of the ship  because that's a 
[00:08:00]  cool view  because that's kind  of a cool view  to get these days  uh yeah they got  that um  uh rock climbing  walls uh  fucking do they  have that surfing  thing on the back  of the ship  the wave pool  surfing  wave surfing  uh i don't know  if it's that shit  but one of them  has a roller coaster  on it  how the fuck  does that float  i don't know  it's amazing  and i don't need  the explanation  that's ridiculous  yeah look it's  like a water  it's a water slide  thing yeah  that they got  it's uh it's 
[00:08:30]  simply amazing  what do you think  the fuel bill is  for that  oh it's insanity  it's just insanity  what that thing  must go through  oh this is why  the rest of the  world hates us  by the way  look at this thing  it has an ice bar  what's an ice bar  where most of  most of the decor  you walk in  into the bar  and it's freezing  cold  freezing cold  yeah  but all the decor  is just hand carved  ice  it's ice  and this isn't  the bar itself  ice 
[00:09:00]  uh yeah  yeah  it's like  it's just crazy  oh that's pretty cool  nice bar  17 degrees  i always laugh at that  because i've gone to  the bowling alleys  on cruise ships  and it's pretty funny  especially when it gets  a little rough  right  uh where  where on a plane  the second it gets  a little bumpy  they want you to  strap in  sure  don't get out of your  seat even to go to  the bathroom  the stewardess is  strapping  a ship is pitching  yawing and rolling  and they give you  drinks and a bowling ball  and just say  go to town 
[00:09:30]  my friend  go to town  they should have  some kind of competition  where if you could  uh bowl a perfect game  at sea  yeah  you get whatever  on heavy seas  some ridiculous amount  of money  they have pool tables  that actually are  on gyros  all right  so it just stays  level the whole time  you can put the cue ball  right in the middle  of the table  and the ship could be  moving around  and the cue ball  won't move  that's pretty cool  it's unbelievable  uh  oh  a lure of the seas 
[00:10:00]  the biggest ship  eric  thank you doug  in ohio  there's one bigger  than the epic  that's probably the  uh um  royal caribbean  i think has the  biggest ship  yeah there was  oasis of the seas  and then the epic  came out for norwegian  so i don't know  a lure yet  well when is this  gonna end  how are they gonna  figure out  that they can't  make them any bigger  bigger and big  and they're figuring  out how to make  them bigger  with less  structure  less visible  structure inside  they have a lot  of the superstructure  is in the uh 
[00:10:30]  the walls  in between cabins  and they hide  hide them in  decorative structures  oh wow  to make  to make the  huge opening  and uh  is it all about  the huge opening  that makes  yeah they love  that they love  that big open  you're in a  fucking amazingly  huge hotel  right  uh space  but a lot  of times  that they  the engineers  had to conquer  the twisting  motion that you'd  get  the ship would  actually twist  in the sea  so no kidding  they figured out 
[00:11:00]  how to how to do  that  i want to see  central park  in the middle  of the ship  i don't understand  how that  is there shops  among central park  there's restaurants  there's starbucks  and gucci  and uh  pretty much anything  you'd see on fifth avenue  and in central park  they kind of  redesigned it  into the center  of the ship  and they can  stop  in the uh  in the middle  of uh  their course  there in  in the ocean  and not drop  an anchor  and not move  because the gps  and the propulsion 
[00:11:30]  pods on the bottom  of the ship  they don't have  like propellers  like old time  screws coming  out the back  right  they got these  pods  on the bottom  of the ship  that can turn  360 degrees  wow  so the ship  could go sideways  if it wanted to  and it does  when it docks  a lot of times  it'll pull up  and then just  start going  slowly sideways  yeah  uh  and it can  hold position  with gps  and these things  i wanna  i'm thinking about  going on a cruise  ship this uh  winter  they're a fucking  blast  i'm going in april  i got the young  kids so i can't  really fly anywhere 
[00:12:00]  and get on a  beach or nothing  yeah they got  them they got  them right  coming right out  of new york  and jersey  i see them  right out of  my window  i'm taking  mine from  uh miami  you have to  fly down to  miami and  then take it  fly down to  miami  but then it  goes all the  way down to  like fucking  honduras and  shit like that  doesn't really  matter  no  just show me  some water  that looks  very different  than the water  i'm used to  that's it  and some sand  and i'm good  they drop you  off every so  often you go  to a beach  just go do  circles and tell  me it's  something different  yeah that's  it  why would you  just keep 
[00:12:30]  going to  different islands  when they all  look the same  it is kind of  they've made  them so big  and they come  out of this  i guess this  one shipyard  in norway  norway  there's this  infamous bridge  i guess over  there that  the news would  always tape  the ships  coming out  of the  shipyard  going into  the ocean  and everything  they made  them so big  that they  actually have  to remove  the smokestacks  and part of  the top of  the ship  just to get  it under  this bridge  and then  reassemble it  after they get  past the bridge  once they get  to the ocean 
[00:13:00]  if it's such  an industry  why don't they  just make the  bridge bigger  or higher  whatever  the queen  the queen  mary too  that comes  into new  york every  so often  they had  to design  the stack  on that  ship  at a very  low profile  to get  under the  verrazano  and they  got to do  it before  high tide  oh wow  or else  they got to  figure all  that shit  out  yeah it's  got to be  timed  perfectly  i saw a  show on  that ship  and they  cleared this  thing by  a couple  of feet  it was  amazing  they had  a camera 
[00:13:30]  up there  and you  just see  the stack  and they  have to go  right under  the center  of the bridge  that's pretty  cool man  let's say  hi to  chip in  ohio  chip  hey how  you guys  doing  what's up  what's up  hey we  were on  that boat  or that  ship  for the  macy's  fourth of  july  epic yeah  and in  in the  i guess  the atrium  they have  the biggest  tv i've  ever seen  it's like  25 feet  by 45  feet  just  insane  and the 
[00:14:00]  deck  has like  i don't  know  some  endangered  teak wood  or i  don't know  panda  paws  and stuff  like that  panda paws  it's just  insane  the cold  bar  the ice  bar  is literally  you know  you can be  in the middle  of the  caribbean  and be  at you  know  12 degrees  and freezing  your nuts  off  but you know  what the hell  you're sitting  on a panda  paw chair  and then  and then  when you  when you  leave  you go back  out into 
[00:14:30]  the 100  degree  weather  and then  catch a  cold  that's  cold  yeah  catch a  horrible  cold  and then  get the  flu  at the  front of  that  epic  ship  they made  like a  private  villa  it's  supposed  to be  if you  don't  want to  pay  for like  the  presidential  suite  there's  a  private  section  tell me  about  that  that's  what  I'm  in  E-Rock  I'm  explaining  it to  the audience  here  so the  back  part  of  your  cabin  has  a  balcony  and  a  private  pool  area  but then  the  front  of  your  cabin  has  another  balcony  and  you're  looking  out  over  the  ocean  so  either  way  you're  isolated 
[00:15:00]  from  the  rest  of  the  ship  yeah  you probably  get to  have  something  cool  like  you know  elephant  tusk  bedpost  we get  it  endangered  animals  yeah  because we  suck as  humans  we get  it  we all  do  we get  it  the  the windows  overlook  the  front  of  the  ship  that's  really  cool  and  they're  you know  they're  they're  mirrored  so  you could  actually  do  things  look at  the back  now it's  just  flat  yeah they  really did 
[00:15:30]  make these  ships  just like  almost  square  stacked  them up  really high  rectangles  right  they sure  stacked  them up  all right  chip  thank you  all right  by the way  your browns  are going  down  uh  well  i'm  in  cincinnati  and the  bangles  suck as  well  ah  fuck  the  bangles  no one  talks about  the way  hey uh  moving on to  other things  there anthony  yeah  we talked  about uh  the soup  yesterday  the soup  the mayor  and his  campaign  against soup 
[00:16:00]  because of  the sodium  content  so of course  our nanny  our nana  mayor here  in new york  bloomberg  has decided  to uh  get about a  about a  $370,000  advertising campaign  in the subways  all you know  taxpayers dollars  of course  uh  in the subways  where it shows  a can of soup  and it's  opening up  and just  salt is  pouring out  of it  to inform  the people  let them  know  soup  is very  dangerous  so why  do they  keep telling  us like  the state's  running out  of money  america's  running out  of money 
[00:16:30]  when  you see  the waste  that goes  on  if we're  hard up  for money  in new  york state  or new  york city  why would  you do  this ad  campaign  just to  tell people  that soup  could be  bad for  you  yeah  and then  it leads  to today  obviously  and you're  amazed  that people  don't know  that cigarettes  are bad  for them  yeah  and I had  to tell you  well they don't  know soup  is bad  for them  well  soup's a little  different than  cigarettes  as far as  knowing if 
[00:17:00]  it's bad  for you  it's the  same shit  though  people just  don't know  for some  reason  the basic  gist of this  story is  they want to  start putting  pictures  on cigarette  packs  horrific  pictures  now they do  this in  canada  right  they do  this in  canada  they  they have  rotting hearts  Canadians love to  fucking smoke  it's not doing  any good  and one of the  really funny  thing about  the Canadian  ones  one of them  is a smile  with like  rotting  tobacco teeth  right 
[00:17:30]  cancer teeth  cancer gums  whatever  and it's funny  because you  hold the pack  up to your  mouth  and it looks  real silly  because it  looks like  you've got  fake teeth  you ever do  that Travis  you ever see  people that  hold up the  cigarette pack  of cancer  teeth  it's great  it's funny  it's a funny  gag  it turns into  a game  it turns into  a game  a funny gag  it's wax lips  it's whatever  it is  so they want  to do that  but my whole  take is  there's a warning  on the fucking  thing  that says 
[00:18:00]  look  this will cause  cancer  heart disease  fucking infant  mortality  whatever the  fuck  and people  just know  there's no  one  I don't care  what third  world shithole  you're from  that cannot  possibly  can't know  that cigarette  smoking is  fucked for  you  I want to  see the  numbers after  they have  the pictures  on the packs  Canadians smoke  like crazy  it's been like  that in Canada  for a long time  and they still  don't have  numbers  people are still  smoking  like crazy  in Canada  they love 
[00:18:30]  their smoking  when I used to  buy my cigarettes  in Canada  there's various  different types  of ads  some are  really disgusting  and some  aren't  so you  would just  go in  and when  you would  buy your  cigarettes  you would  just tell  them to  give you  a different  pack  one that  didn't have  some  disgusting  lung  on it  that's  almost like  the Bill  Hicks  spit  wasn't that  the one  we should  go to a break  with that  later  it is disgusting  you don't want  to look at  it  every time  you pull  your pack  of cigarettes  out  you don't 
[00:19:00]  want to  look at  a lung  but I  know  what's  happening  why don't  they put  big fat  slobs  on the  side of  fucking  happy meals  and shit  like that  why don't  you buy  a brand  new car  and there's  the window  sticker  with the  price  and mileage  and everything  and next  to that  is a  fucking  child  mangled  in the  street  from getting  hit by the  car  there's a lot  of dangerous  shit out there  you're joking  but I bet  you that  that's where  we're heading  with all this  if they  put these  pictures on  cigarette packs  in America 
[00:19:30]  I'm sure  they'll start  doing it  with other  dangerous  products  I don't  doubt it  except for  beer  because that's  the thing  that runs  this entire  fucking  country  a crying  black woman  what is that  about  what does that  have to do  with smoking  she saw the  results of the  midterm elections  maybe she's  upset about her  ancestors and  the filters  something about  that  they're putting  these graphic  labels on  the packs 
[00:20:00]  obviously because  you have to be  of a certain  age  to purchase  cigarettes  so this  graphic content  is for the  older people  that are  allowed to  smoke  so what  happens when  you finish  your pack  of cigarettes  at least I  know what I  used to do  all the time  you just throw  that fucking  thing on the  floor  so how many  kids are going  to be scarred  and just be  crying when they  see some  cancerous throat  just lying on the  floor  dead guy  they just showed  a picture they  want to use  it's a dead  guy  laying there  with his chest  stapled together  or he might not 
[00:20:30]  be dead  it looked like  an autopsy  but I guess  he just had  open heart  surgery  some kind  of cancer  surgery  yeah yeah  this is just  oh god  what is that  person smoking  with their foot  what  no it's just  like a rotting  foot  there's a  miscarriage  baby  how do you  get cancer  in your toes  if you're  smoking  I understand  the mouth  from stomping  out the  cigarette  yeah there you  go  I understand  the mouth  I know how  and the lungs  racism  alive and well  on the OBNF3 show  it's a bell  I know what 
[00:21:00]  they're going to  do next  two years ago  in Canada  now if you  go anywhere  to buy  cigarettes  you can't  see them  in the stores  they're all  behind these  like  like porno  magazines  yeah  they're behind  these black  like almost  like curtains  so you have  to know that  they're there  so the kids  don't see  cigarettes  you know what  they're going  to continue  smoking  sure  obviously  absolutely  the numbers  will be huge  I bet you  this in some  fucked up way  helps the numbers  more people will  end up smoking  like what do you  got I'll trade  you a mouth  cancer for 
[00:21:30]  a rotting foot  make them  hit the trading  cards  yeah yeah  collect them  all kids  yeah well  let's say  hi to Joe  in New York  Joe  hey  hey  what's up  Joe  well  Dennis Leary  had to  bid it  doesn't matter  what the  warning is  you can put  a spell  and cross  bones  on  the pack  people  do this  Dennis Leary  has a bit  where it's  skull and cross  bones  on the side  of the cigarette  packs 
[00:22:00]  and people  still smoking  but I think  Bill Hicks  kind of did  it first  and we're  going to  play Bill  Hicks  his cigarette  bit  going into  break  that guy's  got a problem  there  thank you  Joe  it's the  mustache  did that just  start off as  like a little  zit or something  on his neck  what is that  no big deal  what is that  like a tumor  under his  it looks like  someone made  a hamburger  patty  and affixed  it to  their throat  right to  his  larynx  whatever  that's  fucked up  shit  right there  yeah but  you gotta tell  the people  it's bad  for them  still  the world 
[00:22:30]  seems to be  filled with  dummies that  don't know  this stuff  they're really  stupid  not the people  that are  listening to us  of course  you guys are  the smart ones  for picking  this fine radio  show  I actually  remember  the warning  just being  cigarette  smoking  may be  hazardous  to your  health  that was it  and then it's  like the  surgeon general  has determined  that cigarette  smoking is  dangerous  there's that  one and there  was the  the pregnancy  one  yeah yeah  and that was  it  even when I  was smoking  like 10 years  and now  they're just  all in 
[00:23:00]  not only will  it cause  cancer  let's show  you some  of the  cancers  it'll cause  yeah  I mean  whatever  smoking is  bad  and  you know  I feel like  smoking's up  a little bit  I feel like  I'm seeing  more people  smoking outside  obviously they  can't smoke  inside anymore  so maybe  that's what's  going on  but  I just don't  see how  anyone doesn't  know it's  bad for you  like I'm  not saying  stop  do whatever  the fuck  you want to  do  but there's  no one  smoking that  doesn't know  it's bad for you 
[00:23:30]  it can't be  there cannot be  I can understand  even the soup  thing  soup is delicious  but  you gotta know  like some people  know that the  sodium content  is through the  roof  with canned  soups  but not as many  people  know  but everybody  knows that  cigarettes are  bad for you  it's gotta  be  and I think  the people  that are putting  this whole  thing together  they don't  understand that  when you're  younger  you don't  give a shit  about any  of this  stuff  you're super 
[00:24:00]  human  you don't  think it's  gonna happen  to you  you got  youth on  your side  you don't  think about  that  shit  if I quit  at 25  I'll be  fine  that's the  problem  and then you  keep smoking  oh yeah  I did that  yeah  once I'm out of  college I'll  quit  no problem  Travis would  get so mad  because he  would say  for New Year's  resolution  he was gonna  quit smoking  and then every  year he'd  still smoke  you're not  smoking anymore  oh I stopped  months before  I had my  kid  that's what  made me  stop  oh look at 
[00:24:30]  you  good daddy  don't slow  down  cold turkey  too  I didn't  do the  patch or gum  don't call  your kid  that  oh  cold turkey  were you  jonesing  no  how much  were you  smoking  a pack  a day  and you  just were  able to  wow  I was  breaking down  in tears  every morning  and I was  on the patch  the first 48  hours was  really hard  all you have to  do is get past  the first 48  yeah and you  know what  like  is that true  you think  about 70  I would say  72  so if you 
[00:25:00]  could just  deal with  the first  three days  that's the  worst  you gotta beat  then you're  on a real  good path  then you're  really conscious  if you're  picking one up  at that point  the nicotine  is out of  your system  it's not  there anymore  it's just  cravings  if someone  told you  just get past  the first 72  hours  it's gonna  get a lot  easier  wouldn't that  help you  get to the  end of the  72 hours  yeah I mean  it's one of  those things  where you gotta  be ready to  quit in the  first place  you know  like you  you just  it's one of  those things  you can't  half ass  where if  you're not  sure if  you want  to quit  like you're  just gonna  smoke  like you have  to want  to do  it  so  not like 
[00:25:30]  I'm  one of  these  anti-smoking  people  now that I  quit  I'm not  like that  smoke your  fucking brains  when's the  last time  you smoked  my last  cigarette was  the last  season of  the Sopranos  like second  episode  I remember  it clearly  that's been  a while now  because I  said I'm  gonna sit  down  four years  I'm gonna  smoke this  cigarette  I'm gonna  watch the  Sopranos  and that's  it  then I'm  whacking my  pack of  cigarettes  I haven't  even had  another drag  I'm very  proud of  it  damn  that's what  it is  you just  quit  I'd say 
[00:26:00]  what you  gotta do  is  right when  you decide  to quit  first thing  you gotta  do is  go to  a bar  and order  drinks  and just  sit around  a bar  drinking  because that's  really  and then go  outside with  the smokers  and just have  a little  chit chat  while they  smoke  that's why  I was losing  my mind  at that  meccan  that I  went with  is that  why you  held my  hand  it was  like hot  and sweaty  and like  I'm drinking  beer which is  like the worst  thing to do  because all I  want to do  is smoke a  cigarette  and like  it was hot 
[00:26:30]  and sweaty  and my  nicotine patch  off my arm  I'm just  like I'm  like smushing  it into my  arm to make  more goodness  go inside  me  you need  more goodness  it's very  very difficult  so it's  just more  nonsense  being put  out there  today for  everybody  people will  continue smoking  I want to  give a quick  even though  it's not  FU Friday  quick fuck  you to  an asshole  this morning  on my  commute  you have  one of those  every day  yeah I know  this one was  worse than 
[00:27:00]  it was  because it  was out of  the ordinary  it's not  an ordinary  thing that  I do  I forgot  to get  gasoline  yesterday  so I  wake up  and I  get in my  truck  and I  start driving  and I  realize  ah fuck  I need  gas  you're not  going to  make it  so I know  there's a  gas station  on the  Grand Central  one of those  right in the middle  that fucking  gas station  is scary  as shit  you can't  get on  or  you can't  get back  on the  highway  after you  gas up  no  motherfuckers  that don't  know how  to drive  can't get  on that  fucking  highway  I am  up to  highway  speed  before I 
[00:27:30]  even  hit the  end  of that  ramp  now I'm  getting the  problem  you gotta  boom  this is a  gas station  pretty much  in the middle  of a highway  yeah  it's left  lane exit  and left  lane re-entry  with a relatively  short runway  left lane re-entry  is the dumbest  thing ever  invented  but you gotta  understand  that you're  a left lane  re-entry  there's plenty  of room  even for an  economy car  to get up  to highway  speed  people don't  do it  but this  continues  with what  we've been  talking about  yesterday  with people  don't know  soup is bad  for them  people are  going to  continue  smoking  because they 
[00:28:00]  don't realize  how bad  it is for  them  we live  in a world  with a bunch  of dummies  they're assholes  of course they  should be up  to speed  in the left  lane  but they're  not  I've seen  people hanging  out again  at the end  of that  left entrance  at a full stop  with their head  craned over  their right  shoulder  now it's worse  than the on-ramp  because that's  on the right  lane  now left lane  there's 90  miles an hour  going by  nothing worse  than one of  those people  that are at  a dead stop  and then decide  well I guess 
[00:28:30]  I'll just go for it  I'll creep out  and you're going  70 miles an hour  and you see this  unfolding in front of you  you're thinking  this guy's actually  pulling out  at 10 miles an hour  dumb son of a bitch  and just because  the acceleration  ramp starts  at a certain point  doesn't mean  you can't start  accelerating  before that  of course  how about  the second  you leave  the pumps  you fucking  goose your car  that way  by the time  you hit  even the on-ramp  the beginning  of it  you're already  doing well  so what did  the dummy do today 
[00:29:00]  by the way  that wasn't even  the problem  because  I took off  when no one  was in front of me  so I was able  to just get right on  no problem  yeah that gas station  is fucked up man  and the gas station  itself is a tiny  little thing  very tiny  that's key to this  very tiny  only two pumps  for each side  right  so I pull in  and I'm sitting there  thinking  are they closed  is there some problem  because there's a car  there's probably a robbery  going on  that's a fucking shady area 
[00:29:30]  like I care  like Anthony cares  please  just can't wait  I'll just be in the paper  the next day  you can't wait huh  no I can wait  believe me  are you itching  I'm not  no I'm not  itching a little bit  no itchy  it's a little itchy  not itching  no itchy  no scratching  you need some  calamine lotion  on that finger  put some calamine  on my pointer finger  so it looks like  it might be closed  that's never a good sign  because there's  a minivan  stopped in front  of the gas pump  and there's no one 
[00:30:00]  in it  but then in front  of him  is a car  gassing up  so I'm like  what the fuck  and I'm sitting there  and now  time is of the essence  when I leave  because I leave  and I have everything  timed out to get here  and time to set  everything up  and whatever  so I'm sitting there  like getting pissed  because the guy  in front of the van  I'm not even concerned  about the van  at this point  the guy in front of the van  is taking forever  once he leaves  I can pull in front  of the van  and use that pump  well after sitting there 
[00:30:30]  for five minutes  I'll be realistic  it was five minutes  which is a long  fucking wait  when you're  commuting to work  at a gas station  five minutes  is forever  it's an eternity  oh my god  this scumbag  fuck dick  comes walking  out of the  gas station  with his cup  of coffee  and his donut  in his hand  and looks at me  like oh  oh I wasn't  supposed to park  there for coffee  he left  his fucking car  there  when there's  an area  in front of the 
[00:31:00]  in front of the  pumps  to pull over  and go in  and get your shit  when there's only  two pumps  you're the  again  another idiot  who thinks  he's the only  person on the  face of the  fucking earth  sitting there  with his coffee  and donut  just tying up  a whole fucking  pump  when there's only  two  during the  morning commute  you should have  blew out his  tires  believe me  I was  fucking  like  you  fucking  asshole  what did you  yell with the  window up  I yelled  nice one  cocksucker 
[00:31:30]  with the  window up  no no no  window down  oh you went  with window down  nice  because he looked  right at me  that means he  wasn't black  he looked right  at me  and instantly  his face  went like  oh and he  put two and  two together  like oh I'm  not the only  person using  this pump  oh now I  get it  I thought this  was my personal  gas station  so I called  him uh yeah  I go nice work  uh uh cocksucker  and what did he  say back to you  he put his  shoulders up  with his coffee  and his donut  like now he's 
[00:32:00]  gotta get defensive  that he was  the asshole  it's like fuck  that yeah look  there's the gas  station  yeah it's  very good Danny  you can google  earth it  we all know  that one  it's very tiny  it's on a  median strip  it's on the  thin part of  the median  it just doesn't  belong there  although I've  I've I've  needed to pull  in there a  couple times  a lot of  people have  lost their  SUVs at  that one  really  a lot of  people have  lost their  SUVs yeah  especially uh  a lot of  Asians lose  their SUVs  there  what do you  mean  um gentlemen  will come up  to them and 
[00:32:30]  take their  SUVs  speed away  on a  parkway  it's a  very sketchy  area  yeah it's  a little  sketchy  uh it's  easy to  to kind of  be dropped  off by a  buddy  uh there's  all woods  around it  and then you  just come out  of the woods  you grab the  vehicle and  you take off  and you're so  gone before they  could even  call the cops  you're on a  highway  you're already  miles away by  the time they  even dial  somebody  exactly  dial  dial  do you  still dial  so I uh  I always you  know you keep  your head on a  swivel in those  situations  head on a  swivel hand on 
[00:33:00]  your hip  that's what I  say  the problem is  there's not a lot  of parking there  it's just a weird  fucking spot  there's a spot  in front by those  two trees  there's a spot  and it was wide  open  where you pull  over  see that  right in front  of the pumps  there's a spot  and then walk  your fucking  ass into the  goddamn store  tell the  man  in quotations  behind the  counter  that uh  you want your  coffee  and let other  people gas up  you fucking  dick bag  well look at 
[00:33:30]  Mike uh  relating to you  today  Mike in  Queens  Mike  oh I go to  that same  gas station  I've gotten  stuck out there  first of all  you can get  called by the  cops  because the  highway 3  is right  across the  street  but every  time there's  an accident  every time  there's someone  slowing  for you  they price  gouge you  they put  20 cents  extra on  each one  and by the  way I'm  smoking a  cigarette  right now  and gassing  up  right  yeah  yeah yeah  the prices  at that  station  they know  they got  you  of course  there's no  other gas  station  anywhere near 
[00:34:00]  there  like you're  on the  highway  there's no  exit for a  gas station  close by  if you're  running low  on gas  you're paying  I think I  paid $3.60  some odd  cents for  gas today  at that  gas station  what is gas  prices  3.30  well that's  for regular  sir  regular  and that's  the cash  price  I used  credit  and I get  premium  well that's  good  now they got  your credit  card number  oh yeah  that's not  a safe 
[00:34:30]  place  in Queens  there's  10 cent  extra  if you  use a  credit  card  yeah of  course  no it's  not sir  excuse me  it's called  a cash  discount  you pay  less money  for paying  cash  not more  money for  credit  unlike that  fucking sham  they don't post  the price  of the  on the outside  they only post  the cash  price  yeah  bunch of  fucking  dicks  thank you  brother  and this 
[00:35:00]  just happened  on the  news  we love  the news  tease  it's been  a while  they just  teased  this story  nearly stabbed  today  I fell  the night  going to  my bones  why she  might have  to share  her home  with the  man who  attacked  her  she took  away my  life  tonight at  10  the fucking  news  why she  may have  to share  her home  obviously  it's some  fucked up  loophole  yeah  you know  the news  is going  to make  it like  you know  you're going  to have  to now  live  with your  victims  they're in bed  together  goodnight 
[00:35:30]  she's just  doing the  homer scream  all night  fucking long  oh my god  goodnight  sleep tight  yeah  that's better  this is her  every night  just running  around the house  yeah  I'll carve  the turkey  I'd love to 
[00:36:00]  know what  the real  story is  there  because  it's not  him living  with her  it's  just stop  it  obviously  some dumb  loophole  it's a loophole  he's probably  living in the  same building  maybe  I don't know  maybe she lives  in an apartment  building  I didn't care  enough to  wait around  for the actual  story  I just thought  the news tease  was good  enough for the  show  it certainly  was  as you know  it's just  some stupid  loophole  maybe if  someone knows  they could  call us  we haven't  done stupid  news teases  in a while  anyway  I like that  one  and during  the overnight  period 
[00:36:30]  someone tweeted  me  I think it's  a nine minute  video of a  whole bunch  of news  teases  oh really  I gotta check  that out  give it to  the boys  see if it's  worth putting  on the show  today  some people  tweet  things that  I saw  like six  months ago  it's just  astounding  you don't  want to  call them  idiots  I just  take it  and delete  it  but it's  like  I'm stunned  I've been  flooded  with cake  farts  yes  why is 
[00:37:00]  cake  farts  making a big  comeback  not only did we talk about cake farts  we had one of the cake fart people on our show  at the old studio  we did cake farts  live on our radio  I guess maybe some new site  picked it up  or people who haven't seen it  it's the strangest thing  it's like dude  you gotta see this  I'm sending multiple cake fart emails a day now  where it's just like  no no no  we did this  no we saw it  we did this  did you guys see Star Wars Kid?  what does he do?  I haven't seen that  no  you want people to tweet that to you too?  oh yeah yeah yeah 
[00:37:30]  we're Star Wars Kid  all I got yesterday  I got a lot of tweets on  the pedo?  no  the pedo thing is hilarious  how I can improve my gameplay  on  oh black ops  black ops yeah  you didn't get the pedo guide?  oh I did get that  yes yes  somebody did send me that  this is definitely going viral today  Amazon pulls pedophile guide amid outrage  an e-book  this was actually an e-book  don't the e-book people look at what they're going to sell their consumers 
[00:38:00]  and go wow maybe this isn't a good idea  but someone discovered that  an e-book for sale on amazon.com  entitled  The Pedophilia's Guide to Love and Pleasure  oh  or the Pedophiles  Guide to Love and Pleasure  was apparently pulled by the online retailer  late Wednesday  after shocked consumers across the nation  called for a boycott  I'm shocked  the title  authored by Philip Greaves  was published 
[00:38:30]  published last month  according to product details  previously available on Amazon  sold for $4.79 on Kindle  cheap at any price  this is my attempt to make pedophilia  sorry sorry  this is my attempt to make pedophile situations  safer for those juveniles  that find themselves involved in them  yeah you know  you want to  make it better for them  by establishing  certain rules for these adults  to follow  right  you got to follow  certain pedophile rules  a product description read 
[00:39:00]  I hope to achieve this  by appealing to the better nature  of pedosexuals  yes  why  why  make it hard on the child  when you could give  a gentleman  this book  and he could learn  how to  you know  abuse a child  without really fucking his mind up  I guess is what they're going for here  without fucking him up  for his entire life  oh yeah yeah sure  maybe he's just fucked up  until he's 30  with hope that their doing so  will result in less hatred  and perhaps lighter sentences  should they ever be caught 
[00:39:30]  lighter sentences  what is this guy kidding  I don't know man  the world is insane  I love it  the content led to hundreds of tweets  criticizing Amazon  for allowing the title to be sold  and a Facebook page was created  calling for a boycott  of the Seattle based company  what's that all about  you just don't want to be  in the book  banning business  is that what this is about  maybe  totally unacceptable  this is  not about freedom of speech 
[00:40:00]  this is a  how  this is a  how to  how to guide for pedophiles  shame on you  amazon.com  needs a how to book  they are screwing themselves  over just in time  for holiday shopping  screwing themselves over  and then Amazon  stood by its decision  to sell the e-book  wow  what's that about  Amazon believes  it is censorship  not to sell certain books  simply because we  or others believe  their message 
[00:40:30]  is objectionable  the company said  in a written statement  Amazon does not support  or promote hatred  or criminal acts  however  we do support the right  of every individual  to make their own  purchasing decisions  how is this book  even legal  how is this author  not arrested  well again  just writing a book  probably isn't  can we get this book  isn't the problem  oh we're trying to get the book  I'll bring it in tomorrow  Jesus Christ 
[00:41:00]  Danny  kind of looking at  some of the chapters  right now  are we  yes  chapter one  get boner  chapter two  stick inside children  fin  that is  yeah  that's one of those  tough things  where it's like  alright  you know  anyone I guess  has the right  not to sell the book  right  but if Amazon's policy  has always been  whatever book is available  should be made available  then it is kind of a 
[00:41:30]  book banning  freedom of speech  can we at least  punch the author  in the face  yeah yeah  that you can do  you should be allowed  to punch the author  in the face  there will be consequences  and if he's  leading a criminal  lifestyle  by actually  practicing this  then  indeed  he should be  arrested  well obviously  yeah  alright  that's fucked up  that's fucked up  right there  we're gonna  hit our first break  here  oh good  I'm hungry  yeah I'm hungry  man  my blood sugar level  just dropped 
[00:42:00]  during the reading  of that story  did it  Patrice O'Neill  your boner  yeah my boner  your boner  Patrice O'Neill  will be in  today at 8 o'clock  also  Brett Ratner  we've had him on  before  that new movie  looks great  but I don't know  what he's doing  for the movie  what do you mean  that movie  what is it  it's  Independence  I mean  it's Cloverfield  meets Independence  Day  as it looks like  it looks like  Cloverfield  done right  Clover  War of the  World's Day  yeah  Clover  have you seen  the trailers  though  it looks pretty  fucking cool 
[00:42:30]  Clover  no  Clover  section  nine  I'm hoping  that it's different  from other things  I've seen  that it looks  similar to  that's diplomatic  the trailers  I don't know  how they film  that shit anymore  I don't get it  I just don't get it  it's amazing  it is really  they've just gotten  amazing  pretty fucking ridiculous  at putting shit  that isn't there  on the screen  and making it  absolutely look  like it's there  what's the name  of the movie again  Skyline  Skyline right  looks good  check out the trailer 
[00:43:00]  for yourself online  and we'll have  Brett Ratner  in studio  to talk about it  do you think  titles of movies  make people see  movies more  or less  depending on the title  like Skyline  to me sounds like  a movie  it's like  hey  let's go see Skyline  but then those  you know those  long drawn out  titles  and I wish  I had an example  in my head  you don't have an example  because it's  not memorable  yeah  and that's probably  making your point  alright  how about the one  that we had  Terry Gilliam 
[00:43:30]  was it  was it Terry Gilliam  the Imaginarium  of Dr. Parnassus  yes  the Imaginarium  of Dr. Parnassus  that is a horrendous  name for a movie  now would you not  go to that movie  because you just  don't want to say  to your friends  or something  hey let's go see  the Imaginarium  of Dr. Parnassus  I wouldn't go  to the movie  because I don't  know what it's  about by the movie  title  that's the biggest  problem  but even Skyline  like you don't  know what it's  about from the  title but it's  like alright  hey you want to  go see Skyline  ok  makes it a little  easier  it's easier  but Skyline  doesn't really 
[00:44:00]  explain what  the movie's  about  it's not as  much the  explanation of  a movie  as it is  it's embarrassing  to say it  to your friend  at some point  I'm starting  to understand  what you're  talking about  yeah  there are  times where  you're like  oh my god  I can't  say that title  out loud  I'm not even  going to bother  saying this title  to a friend  or something  like that  does anyone  have an  example out  there  you're absolutely  right  there was one  that came out  within the last  year or so  and you're like  I can't  say this  in front of  people  do you want  to see  you want  to see  and it's  just  embarrassing 
[00:44:30]  to say  it's like  I haven't  ordered things  at restaurants  like at  Denny's  and things like  that  because I'm  not going  to say it  I point  at the menu  yeah  can I have  this  can I have  a super  duper  biggie  burger  slobber  knocker  and you're  like  I just  give me  a fucking  cheeseburger  god damn  this is  embarrassing  good point  so we'll  talk to  Brett  and then  Alex Jones  will be 
[00:45:00]  calling the  show today  I want to  know what  he thinks  about the  explanation  for that  missile thing  Dr. Michukaku  said it was  an optically  illusion  first he was  saying it was  a missile  then it's  an illusion  you know how  we talk about  too how the  news has to  make everything  local  so you got  the missile  thing  I'm calling  it the  missile thing  in California  you know  3,000 miles  away  yeah  it looks  like it  obviously  it's starting  to look like  it's just  aircraft  or whatever  that's a lot  of pilots  and professionals  are saying  that have no  interest in this  they're saying 
[00:45:30]  look I've been  in the air  a lot  I've seen  a lot  of things  a lot  of times  it has to  do with  moisture in  the air  where the sun  so it just  looks like  a missile  when it's  actually  an aerial  plane  and the  papers  the papers  get the papers  so this is a  California story  right  of course  so the papers  I gotta find it  really quickly  they're basically  saying we got  one of these  here in New  York  oh right here  look 
[00:46:00]  yo California  we got our  own right here  off the  Rockaways  ah there it  is  and they're  showing  something that  looks very  similar  ah similar  excuse me  to the  the missile  mystery out  there in  California  that's a  plane  just a  plane  taking off  from JFK  right  yeah  so  but they have  to make  it local  like see  it happens  here too  people  of course  they do  the local  angle  it's very  important  on everything  is ridiculous  very important  all right  why don't we  take a little  break  did you find  that Bill Hicks  smoking thing  thumbs up  nice  nothing wrong

[00:57:00]  listening  right after i said  it i'm like  oh that's gonna be  a bad clip  can't for the life  of me remember  but it was really  incriminating  i think it was  something about  penis  and you know  me  hey uh  hey uh  madonna  yeah  madonna  remember her  how about that  madonna  remember her  before lady gaga  hit the scene  yep  she uh  she felt like  holy shit  no one's talking  about me lately  this is where  this comes from 
[00:57:30]  did she do  something with  lordis  lordis  lordis is uh  she looks like  pretty nice  lordis is looking  like a young  madonna  is what she looks  like  a darker version  she's she will be  delicious like  eventually but she  just has to trim  that unibrow  yeah she's still  got that whole  like chrome magnon  yeah she's got  a thing  she's got to get  well somebody  to trim her up  a book i got  off of amazon  yesterday said  that's not a  problem and  you should just  pursue it  yeah lordis is  lordis 
[00:58:00]  but madonna  felt like  fuck  why the fuck  aren't they  talking about me  i better do  something  this is what  these celebrities  do  so she called  up ellen  degeneres  yeah  see the unibrow  i think she's  gonna have to  get some um  oh she's part  what cuban  part man  with that  mustache  part cuban  she's got a  little uh  facial  that was an  older picture  though  like if  now i think  they cleaned  up her mustache  a little bit  y'all we all  saw how hairy  fucking madonna  was jesus christ 
[00:58:30]  oh my god  that is a  mustache  she's got  quite the  little  she's got  the same  mustache  you have  i know  thinning it  down a little  bit  she got the  billy d  williams  going  and those  eyebrows  are amazing  that's much  more of a  problem  she has  right at the  bridge of her  nose  is a venus  fly trap  it doesn't  even look like  eyebrows  it looks like  someone took  the clone  stamp in  photoshop  and made  her and then  made her  eyelashes  in between  her eyebrows  they put her  eyelashes  in between  her eyebrows  exactly  right on the  bridge of her 
[00:59:00]  nose  but look at  those beautiful  eyes  big brown  eyes  she's gonna  be hot  once she  cleans herself  up  i didn't know  she had a  mustache  i think that's  an older picture  though because i  think there's  better pictures  of her  kind of cleaned  up already  alright there you  go that's the  one we're all  looking for  is that the  cleaned up photo  that's the  cleaned up one  you want a  moons over  my hammy  i will never  order a  moons over  my hammy  that's coming  in a lot  no  alright so i 
[00:59:30]  did order a  bikini teeny  once yes i  did yeah  bikini teeny  you could order  but oh that  that's the new  one yeah look  see she's  cleaning up a  little bit  oh yeah  her hair looks  better  she's taller  than her mom  already  she's getting  there  so uh  madonna said  hey man  look at me  today please  so she called  up ellen  degeneres  and ellen  said sure  come on my  show  did they uh  eat each other  out oh look  she looks great  there  how old is she  there jesus  i think she's  only like 11 or 
[01:00:00]  12 still  no  she's getting a  little older now  that happens  every year  what  they get older  they get older  every year  every year  does that bum  you out  so disappointing  how bummed  do you get  when people  have their  birthday  oh it's  terrible  now how old  is she  uh she  was born  i think you're  gonna be surprised  i don't think  she's i i'm  gonna go 13  uh 13 years  uh she was 
[01:00:30]  born october  14th 96  i don't know  if that's her  i think it was  96  6 7 8  9 10  it's 14  you can tell  if a girl's  gonna be hot  by 14  not saying  you know  better down  or anything  i'm just  saying  you can  tell  okay  we'll figure  out her  her age  but anyway  so madonna  uh sam you  can stay in  here for this  because you  you pulled  this shit  so madonna  realized that  no one's  talking about  her  so she  called up  ellen  degenerate  and said  hey i 
[01:01:00]  got something  to say  about a  very hot  topic  bullying  well she  felt like  she  needed to  say  something  she  needed  people  to talk  about  her  she  needed  that's  why this  show  right here  that you're  listening to  is very  important  we break  this shit  down  for you  she doesn't  give a shit  about bullying  i think it  has more  to do with  she's looking  around at all  the bullying  and realizing  that half the  reason that all  the bullying  is happening  is because  madonna hasn't  said that it's  a bad thing  ah  people will  take madonna's 
[01:01:30]  lead  here's the  counterpoint  i think she  looks around  the world  and sees all  those lady  gaga t-shirts  and she's  saying to  herself  holy shit  those used  to be  madonna t-shirts  what the fuck  is going on  people aren't  tapping their  toes to beautiful  stranger anymore  ray of light  anyone  lady gaga  ring  ray of light  came on when  i was driving  to philly  and my wife  goes hey  this is your  favorite madonna  song  i'm like yeah  i know  everyone knows  you know  what's your  favorite gaga  song  uh probably 
[01:02:00]  yeah yeah  romance  all right  we don't have  to play it  today  it is a good  song i give  you that  you'll give  that  i give that  ray of light  is a strong  song  see it's not  as strong as  if anthony  said it's a  good song  and i'll give  you that  because you  kind of like  this genre  yeah it's true  yeah yeah  all right  listen so  we don't have  to play this  yeah  it's very  hits one  friendly  whoo 
[01:02:30]  i'm dancing  hits one  play this  well not  anymore  but they  would  oh they  wouldn't  play it  now  they only  play 20  songs  well i mean  we try to  stay current  wasn't this  in one of  the austin  powers movies  yes i believe  this was from  the spy who  shagged me  right  exactly  and the video  was weird  it was all  choppy  yeah  now do you 
[01:03:00]  like this  hit  uh if  it came  on uh  i would uh  i'd crash  my car  we don't  have to  play this  yeah  you want to  kind of start  bopping your  head while  you're driving  yeah  yeah actually  this is not  bad  than driving  to a telephone  pole  definitely on  purpose  okay we  already did  this bit  i was a i  was a faggot  over this song  months ago 
[01:03:30]  we don't have  to redo  the faggot  it's a faggot  we don't have  to redo it  thank you  thanks for  saving my  ass  fuck you  madonna  well that's why  she appeared on  tv yesterday  that's the only  reason she doesn't  give a shit about  bullying  and by the way  you shouldn't use  that f word  faggot  that's the word  oh  i uh  you just made  one teen  kill himself  we call it  the f word  you just did  by using  every time you  use that word  a teen  kills himself  a bridge  that's right  you gotta watch 
[01:04:00]  out  what are you  allowed to say  these days  could you give  me a list  of words  please  well you  would say  are you  allowed to say  butt pirate  at least  no that would  be  that's offensive  i think  something like  sword swallower  no you  would you  maybe just  say sissy  because that  oh really  because that way  it's not  necessarily  homosexual  what do you  think ants  sissy is  sissy  i would say  sissy is worse  than faggot  no because  sissy doesn't  pertain to  sexual identity  necessarily 
[01:04:30]  sissy is very  retro  that's an old  one  is that like  honky  that's what  yeah yeah  it's around  the same time  a lot of people  don't you don't  hear sissy  that's what  older gentlemen  would call  young guys  hippies and  stuff that  would carry  around like  a bag  you know  they'd be like  yeah look at  that sissy  he's a sissy  you're not going  out tonight  don't be a  sissy  but how come  it was like  cool to have  a motorcycle  with a sissy  bar on it  what was the  sissy bar  the sissy bar 
[01:05:00]  was the big  fucking thing  on the back  oh right  and you know  i guess because  your chick leaned  against it  and she's a  fucking sissy  they don't make  those anymore  huh i don't  see them really  not that  high anymore  is that high  i rarely see  that  all right  so madonna  looking for  attention  went on  ellen  degeneres  to talk  about  bullying  because  it's a  very hot  topic  right now  it is a  hot topic  and this  is what  she had to  say about  bullying  wait  so madonna  first of all  i i i  appreciate that 
[01:05:30]  you wanted  to uh  to speak  to this  cause uh  here because  it is a  very important  cause to  me and i  understand for  you uh  right next to  eating bush  right next to  like having  her her box  eaten  is bullying  yeah yeah  now you're  bullying  that's it  it's like  am i  bullying  right now  because she  likes having  her box  eaten by  another woman  yes  me just  mentioning it  but but  she said  she's an  out of the  closet lesbian  i know but  i don't know  if her list  of interest  goes stop 
[01:06:00]  bullying  get my box  eaten  by a woman  i don't know  that's hot  yeah  this is such  this is such  horseshit  it really is  the stop  bullying thing  is bullshit  that was a  hot topic  two weeks  ago  no one cares  about bullying  anymore  what's up  patrice  no one cares  so speak to  us  well um  i just feel  like it would  be incredibly  remiss of me  to not say  something  um  i am incredibly  disturbed  and yes 
[01:06:30]  you are  saddened by  the overwhelming  number of  teen suicides  that have been  reported lately  um  how many  one  wasn't there  one  there's not a  lot of uh  teens in general  are killing  themselves  not just  not just  the gay  ones  right  right  you know  how many  bullying  related suicides  there have  to be  it's got  to be  less  than people  that have  vending machines  fall on them  like the shark  thing  yeah like the shark  thing  yeah  shark attacks  shark attacks  and more people  are killed by  vending machines  falling on top 
[01:07:00]  of them every year  for the families  that have to deal  with a kid that  killed themselves  it's brutal  and all that  obviously  but it's not  an epidemic  it's not even  close to an epidemic  it's so low  on the list  of what  celebrities  should be  uh hawking  i'm sorry  it's it's it's a  terrible day and i'm not  talking about any  specific instance  i'm just talking about  overall the the problem  of this type of  bullying slash  suicide  uh sorry  i'm not seeing it  as a grave issue  here  there are 8 000 
[01:07:30]  things that i would  put in front of that  yes  shouldn't kids just be  taught to have higher  self-esteem and that  way the bullying  doesn't bother  shut the fuck up  you're right  you're right  it just  it builds character  hi patrice  go on  good morning  you got the sleepy  eyes  oh but i might  yeah  i had like a few  minutes of rim sleep  yeah  that's all you need  i was like i  i feel i  all right  charged up  here let's listen to 
[01:08:00]  madonna talk about  bullying  that's what i walked  in  voice  yeah a month  i believe this is  quite the  it's with that  fucking voice  a month after all  the other celebrities  did it  this is all about  just getting her face  out there because  you know  lady gaga  people are starting  to forget about  madonna  reported lately  because of bullying  i mean suicide  in general is  disturbing  teenagers committing  suicide is extremely  disturbing but to  hear that children  teenagers are taking  their lives because  they're being bullied 
[01:08:30]  in schools  and dormitories  what have you is  is um kind of  unfathomable and  i know a number of  people have already  spoken out about it  but i feel like i  need to say  something um  sing material girl  incredibly supportive  of me  i wouldn't have a  career if it weren't  for the gay community  so i you know  and i have  yeah  the gays love the  madonna  she's trying to steal  that from gaga too  love her  no lady gaga stole 
[01:09:00]  all the gays away  from madonna  madonna never really  admitted that the gays  like her  i mean gaga really  gaga took all the  new gays  yeah but ever since  madonna's probably  still got the the  old stretched out  balls gay guys now  yeah  oh man she is so  jealous of lady gaga  oh is she ever  this is all about  lady gaga has nothing  to do with gays and  bullying and teen  suicide  gaga ought to come  out with uh cone  bra tits  yeah and everybody  would call her a  genius  made of meat  meat cone tits 
[01:09:30]  yeah how is madonna  dressed  she was dressed uh  uh conservatively  yeah that's her new  thing huh  yes yes  and i also uh i also  have a teenage daughter  and i have ongoing  discussions with her  about this  this topic  why you're  bullying or lesbo  sex  which one  which one  i don't think they  brought up lesbo  no  lesbo  what  i love the word 
[01:10:00]  lesbo  they're talking  why why why would  she have this  discussion with her  daughter her daughter  set up for life she  has no problems her  daughter's just a  regular teen oh  is she really on the  internet could be  bullied facebook really  yeah you never know  about her eyebrows  really  they could bully her  about her eyebrows  hey big eyebrow girl  and then she like she  beats them up with  with stacks of  thousands  just throwing them  just throwing money  stacks of old  madonna cds 
[01:10:30]  yeah they're gathering  a lot of dust because  even madonna's daughter  is listening to lady  gaga  oh how bad is that  does that happen you  think madonna goes  upstairs to her room  and she quickly shuts  up and is like what  were you playing what  was that what was  that lord is and then  she hits the button  practicing her  madonna's practicing  her non-regional  dialect  yes  her non-regional  dialect  so everyone likes her  exactly  unfathomable 
[01:11:00]  unfathomable  unfathomable  all right let's  listen to madonna  talking about bullying  this is yeah  could be the best audio  of the day  i have ongoing  discussions with her  about this this topic  so i feel like um i i just  need to say a few words  yeah  it's important  otherwise the bullying  continues  the bullying thing is the  fucking  the cause du jour  this is going to peter  out faster than any  other cause ever 
[01:11:30]  oh yeah  because you'll always  have some type of  bullying  yeah  why are kids now  special  yeah yeah what the  fuck when did that  happen  why are we  why are we raising  these bums  it's like in school  there was an a you  call the kid a retard  or an idiot  that's offensive  and now it's you  know add  he's got some kind  of problem  uh bullying was  what happened  uh you'd come home  crying what happened  uh the kid fucking  pushed me down  and then the father  would go well you 
[01:12:00]  know what you do  you walk up to him  you punch him in the  face you punch him  in the face and he'll  stop  right but and and  and when we were  growing up there were  you didn't know gays  in school  sometimes you punch a  bully and go away  so sometimes he  doesn't go away  so why weren't those  kids killing themselves  yeah because the  because we wasn't  supposed to kill  ourselves  but the gays  the gays accepted  now way more than  when we were growing  up  was a motherfucker  that scared me so  much from from  summer school when i  was in the fifth grade  i go to summer school  or the sixth grade  i i think i dug a 
[01:12:30]  tunnel like vietnam  to get from school  to home  i came out this  fucking sewer  to fucking escape  this asshole  steve oswald from  toronto writes they  better start lezzing  out  yeah lezzing out  because he's bored  with the uh the  interview on ellen  degenerates  there's a kid in my  school used to call  me over to pretend  to tell me a secret  and stick thumbtacks  in my shoulder  holy shit  that explains everything  that explains everything  there was this kid  it's too bad you didn't 
[01:13:00]  kill yourself  why  oh what  i never even  considered it  there was a kid in  school and i only  knew his last name  was bohannon  and we used to make  him  bohannon  that sounds  bohannon  we just call him  bohannon  and we used to make  him uh low crawl  through mud puddles  in the in the  why don't you say  his name  he's probably  ah fuck  crying  he's probably  putting fucking  all that black ink  under his eye  right now  he probably invented  twitter  you know how  these guys turn out  and he'd be low  crawling and we'd  just be laughing 
[01:13:30]  and he's full of mud  just bullying  because because shit  goes down  and i got shit on  and and you'd have  to this was the  lowest common  denominator  when i was in fifth  that's it  no go ahead  go ahead sam  when i was in fifth  grade there was a  new spanish kid who  didn't speak any  english  that's good  so the whole class  at lunchtime spent  the entire lunch period  every day asking him  embarrassing questions  and getting him to say  yes or no at the  wrong times like  do you poop  no 
[01:14:00]  you want to bully sam  yeah  oh you can say it  oh what kind of  poor awful kid  was a fucking  weak enough to let  sam bully him  right  until seventh grade  came when i guess  we stopped talking to  him but he learned  how to speak english  and i was walking  out one day way  after school with  one of my friends  and uh he went up  to my friend who  was also in my  fifth grade class  and grabbed him by  the neck and started  strangling him  yelling i can speak  english now  holy shit  i was out the door  can't bully that 
[01:14:30]  guy anymore  no i figured all  that shit out  another one was  patrick fullan  i'm talking about  patrick fullan  yeah we know  we know patrick  patrick fullan was  a kid in school  and he was like a  big fat kid  it was in elementary  school so he just  got beat on all the  time and we  realized he made a  really funny face  when you punched  him in the stomach  so he'd be up  against the wall  like pinned against  the wall all scared  and everyone would  just punch him in the  stomach and he'd 
[01:15:00]  make this face like  oh like he was  dry heaving or  choking on something  and we'd all laugh  and the next guy  would punch him in  the stomach  in his fat stomach  that's why this  bullying  it's just the way  it is  that's the way it  is and that's the  way it'll always be  but i think the  difference is that  you know we're  raising a generation  of fucking wimps  can i beg your  pardon for just a  second  certainly  not to turn this  racial  black kids ain't  killing themselves 
[01:15:30]  over that shit  right  see  this is an epidemic  because white kids  can't fucking survive  over nothing  over nothing  that's right  if we step on  i got brand new  sneakers on today  if you step on it  i'm gonna stab you  you looked at me  with disrespect  we got no time  we got no time  for fucking murder  killing ourselves  and bullying in the  black community  is just called  robbery  it's just  you're robbing  someone  there's financial  gain to it  i go to worldstar  hip-hop every day  there's a video  every day 
[01:16:00]  of a fucking  of a  the entire project  fighting over  something ridiculous  oh  bitch  you stole my  weave appointment  and his  titties flying  it's a beat down  happening every  day in the  projects  man  i would assume  i would assume  in the black  community  they're not  raising wimps  like they are  in the white  community  they are raising  wimps  there are wimpy  kids out there  that can't handle  this shit  that's why  maybe the 
[01:16:30]  suicide rate  is up  it's not  giving everyone  a fucking  trophy  it's time  to stop  fucking  this  when i grew up  it's either  you win  or you're  either first  place  or last  or last  there's no  second  you just  lost  you just  didn't want  to be last  you didn't  want to be  last  that was it  remember  but now  it doesn't  matter if  you're  it don't  matter if  you're  last  patrice  everyone gets  a trophy  my mother would  point and laugh  at me sometimes  just point and laugh  yeah  this is 
[01:17:00]  you're hilariously  awful  you're bad at that  you're not  fucking good  there are  more things  you're gonna  suck at  than be good at  that's for sure  i had a teacher  that gave me  an f-  because he said  i might as well  like what's  the difference  you really  want to make  it hurt  and my mother  goes you got  an f-  it's like he  made my life  harder  yeah i go  mom's like and  no one believed  nowadays i wish  i lived in the  times where teachers  were accountable for  doing fucked up  things to students  the teacher would 
[01:17:30]  be fired  i had a second  grade teacher  that beat us  with the pointing  stick  like it was me  and this kid  named wesley  she would bring  us into the  closet and other  kids would listen  to us just get  whacked  holy shit  whacked  you could not  possibly get  away with that  they beat the  kids back then  they beat kids  back then  the teachers  with impunity  no suing  no uproar  just beatings  and the parents  usually were like  well what were  you doing  yeah  robbed during  recess  it was brutal  yeah i think  people bully a 
[01:18:00]  lot too  because they  know you  know the  kid's not  gonna hit  back  you know  what i mean  if you hit a  kid back  he's gonna  stop fucking  bullying  now you're  gonna teach  your son  pugilism  i'm gonna  get my kid  in self  defense classes  immediately  mma  at fucking  four  you're just  choking out  all the  four year olds  whatever man  the four year olds  are tapping  i wish i knew  that shit  in school  just to have  it on my  side  but you didn't  get bullied  because you  have big  family right  it was the  fucking  hughes  they'll  fuck you 
[01:18:30]  up  i certainly  got bullied  i was a  small kid  yeah i got  bullied  and your  brother looked  like a  fucking like  he bit  people when  he didn't  look like  he was a  sucker  joe didn't  really get  fucked with  i didn't get  fucked with that  much except  i remember this  one black kid  keith green  of course it  was black  yeah  would come up  and he knew  i was a mark  so he would  just be like  yo give me  50 cent  give me 50 cent  and i'd have  to you know  take a couple 
[01:19:00]  quarters out  and pay this  motherfucker off  and you know  what he never  laid a hand on  me  i didn't learn  that if i  didn't give him  money he'd beat  me up  i just get  right from the  start started  paying him  wow  there's nothing  funnier than  trying out  different theories  of standing up  to a bully  and he can  fight really  well  i'm gonna  stand up to  your fucking  assault on  my  no keith green  you're not  getting 50 cent  did you have  the kids in  school that  would tell you 
[01:19:30]  they knew  karate and  they were gonna  beat the shit  out of you  oh yeah  asian kids  i'm embarrassed  to say this  but i was at  i'm very scared  of asian kids  fighting  i was at a  roller rink  uh remember  that stupid  roller rink  on 25a  heading into  northport  sure  i was there  and i and  i did something  wrong with this  one kid and  he basically  told me look  i know karate  and when this  is over  roller skates  you know  karate  he goes  no but  then he goes  when this  is over  i'm gonna  beat the  shit out of  you  outside  you were  quaking in  your drawers

[01:20:30]  whole thing's  over  and then we  go outside  there's no  great end to  the story  his mom  showed up  and he jumped  in the car  and said  scare the  shit out  of me  by just  saying he  knew karate  i'm like i  don't know  how to  your little  roller skates  i can maybe  wrestle the  fucking kid  i don't know  karate  you ever had  an i ain't  gonna take  this shit  no more  moment  yeah  you just  said fuck  it  there were  there were  these kids  that used  to get  into this  fucking  karate kid  like karate  stance  right  in the  playground  there would  be a  fight  the kid  would get  into that  stance  and win  the fucking  fight 
[01:21:00]  like the  other kid  would walk  away  that was  all right  we'll  was like  move your  feet fast  put one  hand up  in front  of you  and do  this  shit  and  you just  scared  everybody  self-defense  now  or at least  certain  places  that's just  fighting is  something  you pay  to watch  athletes do  they use  the indiana jones  solution  with the guy  with the big  machete  exactly  some fucking  guy stands  and is like  i really 
[01:21:30]  did you learn  how to fight  for no reason  motherfucker  how about  punch this  bullet  let me say  hi to mike  in new york  real fast  mike  hey  good morning  guys  morning  i took  anthony  you hit it  right on the  head  uh  i told my  seven year old  daughter because  she would come  home and say  oh so and so  pushed me down  today  and this happened  like three or  four times  i finally told  her at the  dinner table  in front of  my wife  i said  you know  you do  you take  this kid  and you make  sure everybody's  watching  and you punch  him dead  in the fucking  face  i said 
[01:22:00]  nobody will  mess with you  again  okay  because i did  that in uh  like middle  school  um  which it's  funny you bring  up a roller  skating rink  because it all  started at a  roller skating rink  i was hitting on  this guy's  girlfriend  yeah it shows my  age obviously  but fuck that's  where you're  socialized  but he got  pissed off  and he told  me i'll wait  till monday  monday rolls  around we go  outside and he's  pushing me around  i didn't like to  fight he's pushing  me around and all  that and finally the 
[01:22:30]  fucking switch went  on and i  shut up  motherfucker give  me your money  exactly  give me your  fucking money  shut the fuck up  and send your  wallet in the  mail  i'm telling you  he told his  daughter to punch  this person in the  face and she  wasn't bullied  anymore right  but there's a  culture in schools  right now that  you're not allowed  to fucking touch  another student  and that's why  this bullying is  happening  oh but you're  allowed to bully  though that  i know so  fucking punch the  kid in the face  you're not hearing  my kid will be a  punch a kid in the 
[01:23:00]  in the face type  of kid yes  you sure even  during the  expulsion like  you don't you  punch him in a  fucking mouth  will get you in  another school  whatever  i'm not i really  don't want to  raise a wimpy  kid i see it  happening all over  the fucking place  and i don't know  i don't know how  it's gonna i don't  know how i'm gonna  get past it but i  don't want to raise  a wimpy kid  but are you t  are people teaching  their kids to bully  like are people  saying go ahead and  just terrorize other 
[01:23:30]  children i think the  bullying is happening  if you want to have  a serious i think the  bullying is happening  because these bullies  know nothing could  happen but it's  always happened  it's always fucking  yeah but that's  but i'm not gonna  change the psychology  of a fucking human  child right there's  there's many dynamics  to a kid one can be  a fucking wimpy  pussy the other  kid's gonna go to  school and for no  reason whatsoever  start bullying around  other kids it's part  of fucking what what  they do but if you  know what if you 
[01:24:00]  know there's no  consequences it's  easier to bully a  kid if you know that  kid's not gonna  fucking you know hit  your back but there  always was that  consequence back in  the day that's what  i'm saying that got  hit or they didn't get  hit you just took care  of it among you so  why does it become a  movement where it  gets like what  happens where a  couple people kill  themselves and all  of a sudden it  becomes this thing  like oh they were  bullied first of all  the the gay kid that  jumped off the bridge  it wasn't even a  bullying incident it  was not a bullying  incident it just  wasn't ready to come  out the closet yeah  it was a prank that  went horribly wrong 
[01:24:30]  we pull pranks like  crazy pranks like that  all the time that  unfortunately went  horribly wrong it sucks  they factured in  psychological torment  into the bullying  thing oh is that  bullying now  I felt so bad for  that fucking kid  but look it man  I shook a douchebag's  hand yesterday at  the fucking at the  best buy he tweets  he just tweets hey  Patrice said best buy  buying I just like I  go what if I just  lied to my girl about  where I was like  what you just you 
[01:25:00]  oh you you I got a  divorce like what the  fuck you doing like  I think it's just we  don't have any it's no  common sense right and  there's no code there's  something this is  bitches fault it's  something there's no  code to dudes for  something like we  would do that we're  just yappy kind of  stop it kind of no no  one's scared there's no  guy getting punched in  the fucking face like a 
[01:25:30]  guy like like Randy  Couture he has to live  his life just as a  professional has to fight  other guys who go look  this is what I do for  a living you do this  let's fight but there's  no consequence of  getting your fucking  head your ass handed  in for ratting for  being a fucking  asshole we are telling  everybody where you  are fuck is that  about but that's what  I'm saying there's no  it's like no one  taught this dude to  just be cool yeah  like motherfuckers is  uncool but it's a it's  a it's the code it's 
[01:26:00]  it's opening your mouth  with no consequence  there's the internet  saying hey hey fuck  you douchebag fucker  oh you could be a  bad block them but  that's blocking is like  should have been  punching you in the  mouth back then yes  that's blocking  somebody's text that  came out of their  mouth but and it's so  arbitrary yeah so it's  like you know you get a  lot of fucking tough  guys who aren't men of  the streets you know I  mean women don't deal  with violence on the 
[01:26:30]  regular anyway that's why  they're always yapping  but dudes should at  least have the threat  of fucking of getting  thrown into something  yeah your face punched  listen here's a part two  of Madonna talking about  bullying on Ellen  DeGeneres and like I  said this is all about  Lady Gaga being really  really famous now and  Madonna needed some  exposure were you  bullied as a kid or did  you feel different than  other people when you  were younger um yes  that would that's an  understatement I I still  feel different um yeah 
[01:27:00]  I mean I I can totally  relate relate to the  idea of feeling isolated  and alienated I bet  she doesn't even have  an example of uh bullying  when she was growing  up she has no fucking  bullying stories she  was different she didn't  fit in she wasn't  different she was just  like every other fucking  she was special but  didn't you like didn't  you like being the  different one in school  I didn't want to be like  everyone else no you  didn't nah that's  let's be honest you 
[01:27:30]  don't want to be yeah  you don't want to be  different to the point  where you're getting  fucking made fun of  that's for sure you  would you if you was if  you was if you had a  had a sense of  individual that you you  lost that yeah that's  why I flunked throughout  school I was just trying  to be cool no you had  to be with a some kind  of crowd you had to be  with some it's like  prison you got to be  with a gang that's why  peer pressure peer  pressure is more peer  pressure is more of an  issue than bullying  worse than bullying  it's just being a whack  fucker who doesn't it's  not you doesn't follow  your own fucking 
[01:28:00]  friends it's you're not  your enemies it's your  friends telling you to do  something that'll fuck you  up more than a bully will  yeah man make funny in  you know yeah and  alienated I was  incredibly um lonely as a  as a child as a teenager  and I have to say I never  felt like I fit in at  school I wasn't a jock I  wasn't an intellectual there  was no group that I felt a  part of I just felt like a  weirdo and it wasn't until  my ballet teacher who who 
[01:28:30]  was also yeah she's going  to ballet class we're  supposed to feel sorry  for young Madonna this is  what led her to become the  person she is today she's  pretty much a billionaire  because because she was  different than everybody  in the locker room I had my  big hairy bush that was  made fun of because it  looked like sweater and no  one would let's out with me  yes but that was fucking  what was supposed to be  happening yes that's what  happened there was natural  Hollywood and natural 
[01:29:00]  fucking uh audience there  was there was the jocks yeah  there was drug dealers there  was fucking Mick Peterson the  tough guy yeah you love a  jacket and no one fuck with  there was band fags and drama  fags and no but I'm saying  those I'm naming a crowd of  people who the rest of the  fucking school watch be  Hollywood they were the  celebrities and it was like  TMZ and you and the  Madonnas of the world would 
[01:29:30]  have to sit back and and  fucking watch those people  be Hollywood but no  comments they just have to  sit there and be fucking  the B and the C and the D  crowd and shut the fuck up  while they watched the  football guys get attention  the pretty girls got  attention funny guys got  attention and fucking  everyone else got nothing  they were the audience and  that was what it was  supposed to fucking be so  the Lady Gaga's who want 
[01:30:00]  all the other kids to be  protected they're going  against the fucking code of  how they got big they used  to watch how there's some  girl that Madonna used to  watch and go I want to be  like fucking Cindy McGillicuddy  that's why that's why she got  big shoulders and she's in  shape and she sings songs  she's copying some chick who  was a star yeah she just  made the move and Cindy  didn't Cindy's a fat cunt now  and Madonna's because Cindy  was the shit yeah it is what  it is not every fucking child 
[01:30:30]  should be have an opportunity  it's it's fucked up that that  school is supposed to be more  more so than teaching you the  basics of reading writing and  arithmetic it is supposed to be  this thing that teaches you  how to fit into this to a  society survive yeah to  survive survive well that's  just it there's going to be  people during life in the  working world that are bullies  maybe they don't fucking come  up and punch you in the face 
[01:31:00]  every day but they fuck with  you on a business level you're  either a zombie or the guy  sleeping in the tank here's the  rest of the clip my ballet  teacher who was also gay took me  under his wing was he and  wow introduced me to a community  of artists of other unique  individuals who told me that it  was good and okay the ex-whores  that he introduced her to lesbo  parties or yeah the special school 
[01:31:30]  went to the special school rabbi  professor eggs  javier fucking this is some  after-school shit she's talking  about lesbo parties what is she  talking about magneto is a bully  i don't like magneto mag panties he  has the power to make my clit show  through my drawers  of other unique individuals who told  me that it was good and okay to be 
[01:32:00]  different who um brought me to my  first gay disco and ironically made  me feel like i was a part of the  world and that it was okay to be  different and i can't imagine young  kids today going through their  adolescent years not having somebody  that they can talk to take them to  somebody that they can have an  affinity with that tells them it  should have been reassures them that  it's okay to be who they are how  great is that that's that's kind of  my point now if you have a teacher 
[01:32:30]  that realizes wow there's some gay  kids and stuff i got to take them to  a gay disco  oh my god it would be so fucking in  jail  uproar  right  that's what i'm getting at though  she had nothing by the way  no she had nothing there she had to  talk about it  she had to get on and talk about  bullying  without with nary an example no of  any bullying that went on with her  ever made that she's gay or no no  no no no that sounded like she was  admitting she was gay no she's a 
[01:33:00]  friend of the gay community she was  hanging out at gay discos i mean she  might have gone to a gay who hasn't  gone to a gay club  oh  all right well  the freedom that gave  why is she doing that just a friend  of the community  all right well there you go enough  about the bullying the gays have uh  let it be known by the way a lot of  parents on the phones right now  saying yeah my kid was bullied i told  him to hit the fucking kid guess what  my kid's not being bullied anymore  well don't they think there's a bunch  of them i don't have we don't have  time for them 
[01:33:30]  isn't there something to be said  about positive reinforcement  no no it's stupid it doesn't work  we're we're fucking cavemen  tell my girls could paint her because  she's not getting bullied but it's  like she's she hangs out with the  she's a uh ostracizer because she's  really pretty oh yeah all right so  she hangs out with the pretty and  tall girls and they go they do a  merry-go-round of of who gets  ostracized from the pretty crew that  so she's just like what am i gonna do i've  been told to leave the crew because i'm  the only one that doesn't have a

[01:38:30]  and hard rap  when i'm pushing my body hard  at the gym  the style of music  gets me amped up  and helps me sustain workouts  for as long as i need  and yeah  sometimes i get so fired up  listening to tunes  that i'll throw a couple of fist pumps  into my treadmill routine  that's called  cross training  well why don't you cross dress  and let somebody  fist pump your ass  that was a bumbling oaf's  interpretation of 
[01:39:00]  mike the situation sorrentino's  here's the situation  for the opie and anthony show  the opie and anthony show  on the virus  serious  xm  patrice o'neal in studio  talking about the mcribs  during the break  patrice had a battle  on his hands yesterday  he wanted two mcribs right  oh i've i've  it's a fucking one though  i've won  you won out  i've won

[01:40:30]  with like  packing peanuts  mixed into an auger  and it's a stamp  they're just stamping  those things out  in a tool  to make it look like a red  like they make car parts  they're just fucking  stamping that shit out  and then they cover it  with deliciousness  barbecue sauce  i haven't been at mcdonald's  since i was 12 years old  good to see you again man brett  brett radnor how are you sir  i'm good i can't hear anything  you can't hear nothing  you all right man  what the hell the headphones  pull out of something  oh there you go  oh there it is  that sounds good  now you can hear

[01:41:30]  of bad food nigga  i don't know  it's like a junkie  knowing the best heroin  my favorite burger  of all of them  is wendy's  i gotta say  yeah the wendy's burger  holy shit  i know that  you know what though  no onions though  you've dealt with black people  you're fucking half your life  that's why  black people  wendy's  wendy's is a good show  and if you're in a pinch  burger king is  is uh  is decent  and how can mcdonald's  is like  their commercials  completely cater to black people  cause they're trying to get  black people to buy  black people ain't super mcdonald's 
[01:42:00]  but they do a good job i think  i really think black people  go to mcdonald's  nah man  we fuck with wendy's  yeah  and we fuck with burger king  there's no wendy's around  yeah so they're  they're trying to get  uh some customers away  from those two places  that's why  by doing jazzy mcdonald's  oh mcdonald's  oh just play the jazzy  come in for the mcrib sandwich  the guy with the jazzy butt  mcdonald's  bro reiner's like  i got up early for this horseshit  and we're talking about fast food  and it's a car full of black people  it's a car full of black people 
[01:42:30]  and the kids are well behaved  if you're good you can  man  do black people like aliens  oh yeah i think  oh that's  the movie aliens  no just aliens  aliens in general  do we believe in aliens  no do you like movies  with aliens in it  you know what  yes i would  i would imagine  of course  i don't think that's  fringe  skyline  and look now we're talking  about skyline  exactly  oh you directed skyline  no i produced it  you produced skyline  yeah yeah  yeah  the kid from um 
[01:43:00]  from uh uh  he was in  he was in uh  the uh remake of um  of texas chainsaw massacre  yes  but then he  he fucking  i was nervous about him for a second  it's not about him though  it's about the aliens  it's about the aliens  that that  but he's in it  he has a recognizable face  yeah yeah  he's the human in it  the human  there's a lot of them right  a few humans  but the aliens  there's a lot of aliens  we were talking about the cgi  that looks amazing  the trailers for this movie  are ridiculous  it looks crazy  now what are these guys doing  these aliens  i'm trying to figure this movie out 
[01:43:30]  well i'll tell you  they uh  they're invading the earth  they're very angry  they're pissed off  why are you being coy about it  the fuck is it top secret  i want to know  what are they doing  let's be able to see them  wait a minute though  but i'm talking about  what you see  you see the guys go  don't look at him in the face  this is shit i already know  from the trailer  don't look at him in the face  don't look at him  question  you're driving down the street  there's an accident  on the side of the road  ambulance is  is there one person  that's not gonna go  oh my god  look at that over there  everybody's gonna look  i don't look  i look at the guy in front of me  if i see brake lights 
[01:44:00]  i get on my horn  i'm like move  you son of a  most people are gonna look  so these aliens are out there  they'll come  now may i ask  is it an attack movie  or is it a kidnapping  oh it's an attack movie  it's an attack  and a kidnapping  okay  and you found dan rother  which is weird  there he is  right there  hey look at that  good old dan rother  doing the news reports  it's a great look  and it's giving me  that feeling  that independence day  gave me  back in the day  when i saw a trailer  except this was done  independently 
[01:44:30]  like literally  these two guys  called the brothers  i wish i had  the brothers ratner  so i could put  some of the blame  on my brother  no it's the guys  who directed  alien versus predator  oh okay  yeah  okay  and they  they're visual effects  gurus  and they did  i met them  because they did  x-men the last stand  it is ridiculous  the visual effects  and they did  benjamin butt  and they're incredible  and these guys  did this all  on their computer  like literally  they shot this movie  like in 20 something days  with no money  in their own apartment 
[01:45:00]  there were no trailers  i swear to god  this is their building  where they live  in the whole movie  takes place  in that building  all of a sudden  they brought out  the goods  i mean these guys  when i saw  you know  they're really good  it is amazing  what you  it's mind blown  it is  it looks like  a big budget  film  and it costs  nothing  how much  is nothing  you want the truth  yeah  all in  yeah  10 million dollars  the movie looks  like it costs  150 million  it sure does  is that it  Danny 
[01:45:30]  that's the only thing  out  how excited  are you  Brett  i can't  i'm happy  just to be  a part of it  you know  i got jealous  i was about  to direct  superman years ago  jj abrams  wrote it for me  he was like  my writer  all of a sudden  he's directing  mission impossible  he's got all  these big movies  i'm like damn  i've been  wouldn't i have  been sleeping  i was spoiled  with rush hour  with chris tucker  him and i  the brandon roth  superman  you was gonna do  no  yeah  well i mean  before that  i know  that was supposed  to be that  that one  this is all 
[01:46:00]  on a computer  it's unbelievable  these guys  i'm not kidding  are geniuses  i mean they did  every  they did avatar  i mean visual effects  stuff like that  these guys are brilliant  and actually their first movie  i think was with  jim cameron  when they were like  19 years old  they're basically  computer geeks  but they're brilliant  why not in 3d sir  oh come on  3d's taking over the world  i think the sequel  will probably be 3d  we didn't have the money  for 3d on this one  you can tell  they're really good  with microsoft paint  yeah  that seems to be  what they use 
[01:46:30]  for the visual effects  it's a  but what's cool  is i mean  the visual effects  are mind blowing  but it's a great story  it's a character driven  film  and i think  it's it's a movie  that you go in there  and i don't think  you even  i mean the story matters  obviously we're there  to watch the story  and to care about  the characters  but you're gonna be  blown away  watching the  the visual effects  are mind blowing  i mean literally  mind blowing  you feel like  it's happening  around the world  i mean these guys  are like  and i'm watching  the footage  as they're shooting  and i'm going  god  you know  not imagining 
[01:47:00]  what it's gonna be  i know  i know  you know  the design  and the creature  and everything  and then all of a sudden  these guys are visionaries  i mean there's something  else going on here  there's the aliens  which is great  you know  the machines  the friggin  black scrubs  but then there's  something else  black scrubs  then there's something  else going on  with the you know  if you look at this thing  something happens to you  the amazing  the thing is  this i think  honestly what this film  is going to do  more than anything  whether it's the biggest  hit in the world  or not  what it's going to do  is really change  the model 
[01:47:30]  every studio  every movie studio  is going to change  their way of making movies  because they're not  going to say  why do we need to  spend 250 million dollars  to make an event movie  yeah  these guys  these kids  made it for 10 million dollars  and they're  i mean  look at this shit  i mean it looks like  it's a 100 million dollar movie  which blew me away  yeah  i'm just happy to  be on the bandwagon  exactly  and you know  it's something  fucked up happening  because the statue  of liberty's  panties are showing  anytime the statue 
[01:48:00]  of liberty's  fucking draws  yeah yeah  you know there's a problem  she's got a fucking  tampon on  it's like  oh jesus  basically the premise  is mass abduction  on a global scale  that's what it is  on a global scale  these aliens are coming in  you look into the light  you get sucked  into the spaceship  you just look up  and it's calling you  people started  by masses  are just going out  in the street  they're going out  in the street  and all of a sudden  you look up  and that shit sucks you up  and it's gonna  i'm telling you  it's gonna freak people  i didn't know what to ask  i don't know  what's the secret  now  are they  are they 
[01:48:30]  they need to  are we food  are they populating  their planet  don't tell me  i don't want to ruin it  yeah i don't want to know  i didn't  i thought that might have  ruined it just now  listen the film  you can kind of see  they're sucking people up  the film deals  the film deals  with the end of the earth  but i'm telling you  they're not just killing you  so that's what's gonna  freak you out  they're not just killing you  is it an hour  fifty two hours  it's sixty two minutes  no i'm fucking with you  wait a minute  you're gonna leave  the theater wanting more  wait a minute  sixty two 
[01:49:00]  i like bread  you know  the thing is  i make kind of  reality based  you know  kind of action comedies  most of them  i've done red dragon  the prequel  sounds of lambs  i've done you know  family man  but most of my stuff  is kind of  you know  x-men  kind of reality  i mean  the truth is  this movie  is an alien movie  but you buy it  i mean that's the thing  that's gonna scare  the shit out of you  that's why we got  i said we gotta get  something like  dan rather  you know  something that  that is gonna  be a voice 
[01:49:30]  that's gonna say  yeah because steve hawking  is saying  steve hawking  you know this guy right  he's like  aliens are coming  and there's people  in america  that really  really believe this  so these are the  i'm telling you  jesse the body  no no  this isn't a  scientology shit  i mean people  are saying  that it's coming  and uh  and this movie  just kind of  is like  everyone's fears  like what would  you do  basically this  is dealing with  what would  you do  if aliens  came  how would  you deal  what would  you do  you're in  this building  mass 
[01:50:00]  rape  hide  i gotta be honest  i get a bunch  of guns  and just commit  a lot of  horrible sexual  crimes  knowing the laws  are gonna change  drastically  by tomorrow  the law's very  very busy  right  at that point  so i think i get  away with it  you can't just say  the aliens are coming  what's their proof  why are they saying  that  i'm just saying  scientists  people i mean  if you look  that report  by the way  that dan rother report  and i'm telling you  right now  the dan rother report  was a real report  with another journalist 
[01:50:30]  that we couldn't  license  that we couldn't  use  and we went  verbatim  the stephen hawking  thing about stephen  hawking saying  that the aliens  are coming  blah blah blah  that is a real report  that we recreated  you know  i mean there's  look on the internet  i mean it's like  the most talked  about shit in the world  i mean you know  and that's why  these films  you know  are really working  you know  i don't believe  in aliens at all  you don't believe  in aliens  no  i believe  just like ghosts  i don't believe  in things that  that tease you  and they  and they don't  do that 
[01:51:00]  like  yeah like do that  i believe in that  if that happens  i don't believe  in peeking around  maybe they don't  have a reason  to do that yet  they're reasoning  they're fucking  hiding behind clouds  and they're still studying  we shit every day  and die every day  yeah i don't know  if they're hiding  behind clouds  they're trying to  figure it out  i don't believe  i believe there's  aliens out there  i'm not sure  about the whole  ufo thing  i believe there's  a lot  there's life  somewhere  in the spooker  spooker system  and they don't  know us either  they're walking  around except  for their fucking  noses on their  forehead  and they're 
[01:51:30]  fucking shopping  at the alien  whole foods  that's what the  fuck they're doing  and they got  the same problems  we have  what if they  look like you  and me though  they do  fuck them  you know what  they bet  they probably  do look like  us  because they're  going by the  same  things that the  universe is going  by  the same rules  of the universe  so it's probably  the same shit  except maybe  different sun  slight variation  i can believe  there's a krypton  out there  but superman 
[01:52:00]  will die  you think there's  here  you think there's  blacks on other  on other planets  there's different colors  there's niggas  i don't know  if there's blacks  but there's a  fucking green  and orange  motherfucker  who gets  fucked over  and fucking  on slew  fond five  you're talking  about like  you're talking  like they really  exist  you start to  believe  i believe  in other  life forms  but that's  that's what  an alien is  but i don't  believe in that 
[01:52:30]  they're here  they don't  they didn't  build the pyramids  they didn't  do nothing special  who built  the damn  pyramids  some fucking  Egyptians  yeah  who built  yul brenner  he built  them  what about  those  ancient  landing strips  with the  signs  you don't  think  they are  either  lines  old man  with a  great  lawn mower  that's  not that  i'm talking  about the  stuff  that is  carved into  the rocks  and shit  those things  they're only  like a 
[01:53:00]  quarter of an  inch deep  these things  but they  they're visible  from airplanes  why are there  landing strips  when  when alien  ships  can just  go  and do  that  where's that  one  so they had  a fucking  mayan  with two  flags  that's an  ancient  there's  ancient  airstrips  some of them  are in  peru  yeah man  why are they  in peru  like that  how about  the  the  the  sculpts  the faces  what are they  called  the  the sphinx 
[01:53:30]  no no no  no  on mars  no  no  eastern  island  yeah  the heads  on eastern  island  i believe  that people  had a lot  of time  dude  with sticks  and forks  and carved heads  they just carved  stuff  how the fuck  do they make  that  which fucking  people  you think aliens  did that  and left them  there  yeah  why not  why  here's my thing  why not  i can believe  but i don't like  all this  playing around  that's what  i'm saying  i don't like  the playing around 
[01:54:00]  that's my problem  it's like  aliens are these  these supernatural  things that are  watching us  and gathering  information  and abducting us  but they're  playing around  land in central  park  motherfucker  yeah  like stop  playing  get out  start shooting  people with  ray guns  what are you gonna do  if they start  landing  what the hell  i'll fucking cry  like everybody else  is gonna cry  you're gonna be  a little bitch  i'm gonna cry  exactly  i'm gonna fucking  whine  and have them  fucking  you know  i like this guy  right here  hopefully they want  to eat fucking  white people 
[01:54:30]  look that's  that's a real  alien  like these  this is why  um the kind  of movie that  you're doing  skyline  get theaters  tomorrow  it's visceral  to me  like like i said  when i saw  independence day  the first  yeah yeah  or or that  visceral feeling  when i when i  when you get  when you see  the giant tidal  wave that's in  every end of  the world  that that  like oh  this is the  end of the  world movie  but that  for those  so i'm  they're kidnapping 
[01:55:00]  people too  so don't be  scared if you're  sitting in magic  is there magic  johnson theater  in new york  people are gonna  be screaming  at the screen  uptown  run motherfucker  run  so you're putting  your reputation  on this movie  there brett  i love the movie  i think it's  more it's more  than just loving  the movie  i really think  it's when i  love young  filmmakers  guys are up  and coming  that are smarter  than me  better than me  going to the  next level  like jj did  with you know  with his movies  that he's directing  these two young  guys are really  young i mean  to me i'm an  old man now  but these guys  are kids  and i did my 
[01:55:30]  first movie  when i was 26  these guys are  probably 30  right now  and they're  blowing my mind  it's like they  just they grew  up you know  watching my movies  and i'm now  looking learning  from them  which is incredible  talking about  like jj abrams  and stuff  i could still  i've watched  that star trek  movie 20 times  and i could  watch it again  i gotta watch it  it's great  fantastic  i'm not a  star trek fan  it's one of  the best like  movies as far  as taking a  subject that's  been beaten  to death  star trek  i mean how  many fucking  movies have 
[01:56:00]  they made  and everything  and that's  what i love  this you know  thinking outside  the box and  i'm worried about  what other people  did in the past  that's what i love  it's like i love  seeing people pass  me up i'm not  one of those guys  fuck those young  motherfuckers they  don't know what  the fuck they're  doing i'm the  man you know i  really believe that  you know the next  generation is is  just keeps getting  better right like  these are guys that  have to like  brett and jj  abrams and a  couple other guys 
[01:56:30]  are the guys i  remember i had a  meeting i said  man i one day i  want to i want to  be like uh uh  what's the big  boy the big boy  big big boy  lucas the producer  bilbert oh  now he's in your  genre um his  boy his partner  died oh jerry  brockheim i said  brockheim i said  man man i would  love to produce  something and then  like just shoot  him off like  brockheimer the  guy laughed in my  fucking face but  jj stop right  jj abrams yeah he  looked away and  shit he's he can 
[01:57:00]  do it that's like  them fucking aliens  a fucking nigga  brockheimer ain't  gonna happen but  you see ratna and  jj are the guys you  can see the guys that  are coming up to  like be the new  brockheimers that  are yeah that are  in there and jj's in  there like you know  like that and i  always wondered how  do how does a guy  like jj abrams get  to be the star  trek guy or how  does peter jackson  get to be the  fucking hobbit  you know what it  is it's just it's  just you know guys  move coming come up 
[01:57:30]  and they move out of  the way and you  never you know it's  like the guys you  know when i was  doing uh i remember  before me when i was  doing music videos  hype williams was  doing videos before  every guy yeah and  he was the hot shit  and then all of a  sudden i started  coming up and then  i was and then all  of a sudden when i  went on to do  movies paul hunter i  remember came to see  me he's like god i'm  only doing these 10  20 000 movies video  music videos how  am i gonna get to  do this guy's then  he's then he became  the next guy so you  know there's always  the next guy no but  i mean literally  yeah these guys get  their fucking hands 
[01:58:00]  on king kong like  how did he how do  you get your hands  yeah yeah on the  product well i  never how do you  direct it but how do  you on a huge  franchise you know  what it is i own  this shit i'm fucking  a king kong guy now  i never i never i  knew i'd be making  movies i never dreamed  i'd be making movies  as big as i was you  know i mean i never  thought god i'd be  making a movie like  rush hour x-men or  200 million dollar  movie yeah i never  thought because when  i was a kid i remember  seeing batman and  going oh my god never  dreamed i'd make a  movie as big as that  and then i do x-men  it's bigger than that  yeah yeah it's i i 
[01:58:30]  don't think you know  i think you just gotta  you know i don't want  to be corny or  anything but you gotta  believe in yourself and  your time it's the  wrong i think i'm i'm  not doing i'm being  literal but probably  not how do you make  but how this is  obviously his hands  you gotta have the  talent but then star  trek peter jackson's a  prime example because  jackson's on star  trek directing movies  that were you know  all right they're  they're these cheesy  horror movies yeah and  then he gets one of  the biggest franchises in 
[01:59:00]  history yeah and does  an amazing job well he  was passionate about it  he had a point of view  he had an idea he got  on the right in the  door because i think  what it is is it's  passion tenacity  persistence i don't  give up but if you  look at his earlier  movies oh yeah right  before there's no  right if you looked at  my student films you'd  be like this guy's  never gonna make it  like why is he why  would they hand him  lord of the rings for  god you know people  learn they grow they  focus they get you  know it's not only  it's it's it's look uh  i think there's a lot  of luck too but luck is 
[01:59:30]  when opportunity meets  preparation i got an  opportunity i was  prepared i got offered  movies before i did  rush hour but i didn't  want to do them because  i said i'm gonna fuck  this up i'm not ready  yeah so i what i did  i said i'm gonna do  a hundred music videos  before i do one movie  that was my strategy  then i do that i'm  like you know what i'm  ready now i did money  talks money talks is  great yeah that was my  first movie that matter  of fact that goddamn  chris that was even  though i think his best  acting job was uh fifth  element to be honest  but um he's great  for them  fucking  yeah what the fuck

[02:22:30]  I'm here guys  it's great to be back  there he is  I'm just fucking around  you're really there  I'm here waiting in the wings  what the hell was up  with the Guns N' Roses music  I'm very confused  do you know  probably  we were just sending you music  to give you audio  to know that we were  connected to you  oh okay  that's how it works  we got Patrice O'Neill in studio  Alex has no patience  for anything  nah  you have patience  Alex don't you  he told you exactly  what it was  he's busy exposing things  a couple things 
[02:23:00]  we were just talking  about aliens  because Brent Ratner  was in studio  he's producing that movie  Skyline that starts tomorrow  and he thinks the aliens  are on their way  and they're going to be  attacking soon  what do you got on that Alex  well we know that  obviously  Hubble telescope  and orbit  has photographed  hundreds and hundreds  of billions  of galaxies  and now it's been able  to look even further  out in space  and begin to photograph  clusters of trillions  of galaxies  with 
[02:23:30]  just unbelievable  you know  amounts of  planets  orbiting those  tens of trillions  of suns  and so there's no doubt  that there's life  in the universe  outside of our  tiny planet  two thirds  of the way out  on the spiral arm  of the Milky Way galaxy  that said  search the term  Project Bluebeam  and Project Bluebeam  is a partially  declassified  U.S. government  program  to have fake 
[02:24:00]  alien landings  as a pretext  to unify the planet  around world government  against an outside threat  and now the United Nations  the Vatican  and others  have appointed  full-time ambassadors  who are on call  24-7  to meet the aliens  when they land  and so  we know  through the  mainstream media  and the controllers  of culture  that they're really  imprinting  the public mind 
[02:24:30]  and the subconscious  with the idea  that the aliens  are coming  and under Project Bluebeam  they admittedly  have programs  to project  giant flying saucers  into the sky  Buddha  Jesus  Stay Puft  Marshmallow Man  if they choose  So you don't believe  in horse shit  with the aliens  right  Alex?  Well I'm saying  that I don't know  if aliens  have visited the earth  But do you feel that way?  Do you think that happened?  I know  that there's a government 
[02:25:00]  program  to create  fake flying saucers  in the sky  and I know  that the Air Force  admits in the 40s  50s and 60s  that the Army  Air Corps  and the Air Force  and others  hyped up  the UFO phenomenon  to cover up  their secret  Personally  and I'm saying  personally  your personal  just  you know  you live in  the union  you personally  feel like  there's aliens  watching us  To be clear  I believe  that there is  life in the universe  I don't know 
[02:25:30]  if there's aliens  I feel the same  way there's life  but I don't believe  that they're  watching us  and the only reason  I don't believe  is because  I don't believe  if they had  the technology  or like  if we had  the technology  to watch things  that we would  just be peaking  for 10,000 years  and then  come out of a cloud  and whatever  I just don't believe  they're up there  playing games  I tend to agree  with you  and look  I mean  there are  trillions  and trillions  and trillions  of galaxies  with hundreds  of billions 
[02:26:00]  of stars  per galaxy  and we're  pretty self-centered  if we think  out of  untold  quadrillions  of planets  with billions  of them  no doubt  being habitable  that anybody  cares about us  it's kind of like  if you're walking  through a field  that's got a billion  bacteria in the dirt  and on the grass  that you bend down  with a magnifying glass  and obsess  for thousands  of years  over one little  group of bacteria  now 
[02:26:30]  there is another  view  in all of this  that my gut  tells me  that if the aliens  are here  and if all of this  just isn't  an elaborate  disinformation  operation  and then a lot  of fiction  writers  and people  get tied  into it  so it gets  a life  of its own  that these  aliens  reportedly  and it is  in a lot  of the ancient  Sanskrit  the hieroglyphs  I've been down  to the Aztec temples  in Mexico  that literally  have what looks  like rockets  and jet aircraft  carved on the walls  that if these 
[02:27:00]  aliens are really  here  that it's not  aliens  that it's  humanoids  or our  progeny  from hundreds  if not thousands  of years  in the future  who are coming  back in time  and the quantum  mechanics  of Einstein  and others  have shown  that this is  real  that our  advanced  civilization  may be  time traveling  back  to manipulate  the future  or to study  or with all  these abduction  stories  maybe they need  the genetics  that they've  lost  from primitive 
[02:27:30]  times  so it's really  us coming  back  that's very  interesting  no no  I got what  he's saying  I'm on that  I want to  switch gears  here a little  bit  talk about  this missile  what are you  hearing about  the missile  slash airplane  well they've  had former  NASA rocket  engineers  rocket scientists  and they've  had what one  of the former  joint chiefs  of staff  have been  interviewed  day one  saying that's  clearly some  type of sea  launched missile 
[02:28:00]  looks like  something similar  to a Polaris  submarine  launched  and we know  that in  2000 you  can actually  search North  Korea fired  missile at  Alaska  10 years  ago  of course  North Korea  many times  has fired  missiles right  over Japan  crashing into  the ocean  right off the  coast to  threaten them  they did it  again a few  years ago  North Korea  fired a missile  that came back  into orbit  they fired it  over the  North Pole  because they're  right over the  pole  that's the  shortest distance 
[02:28:30]  for an  intercontinental  ballistic missile  and then it  didn't have good  aerodynamics  it was a dud  it was a drone  it was a test  missile  no warhead  and it broke  up over  Alaska  its intended  target  and rained  down  that actually  came out  in the  Alaskan  newspapers  it came out  in AP  they actually  shot a missile  and it hit  the US soil  yeah this was  10 years ago  and so  what even  mainstream news  is now saying  is that  quietly the  Pentagon  some people 
[02:29:00]  are saying  China  or North  Korea  had a  sub  pop up  off the  west coast  and fired  a test  missile  as a  threat  and of course  just a few  months ago  the US  the South  Koreans  and the  Japanese  were out  in the  South China  Sea  and were  firing test  missiles  as well  so this  is what  governments  do  kind of  like  when they'd  send the  Russian  bear  nuke  bombers  over  during the  Cold War  they started  doing that  again  we knew  they were  coming  how the  hell  does  somebody  get that 
[02:29:30]  close  especially  someone  with  like  North  Korea  get that  close  to the  coast  of the  United  States  well  it's  international  waters  they've  had  cases  notice  tensions  are very  high  right  now  because  the  private  Federal  Reserve  has  announced  600  billion  to a  trillion  dollars  of  QE2  quantitative  easing  or  monetization  of debt  which is  going to  devalue  all  global  currencies  and cause  inflation  because  the dollar  is the  world  reserve  currency  so it's  causing  global  problems  the  Chinese  governments  downgraded  our 
[02:30:00]  credit  rating  they've  been  threatening  us  the  Russians  are  threatening  the  French  the  German  banking  minister  finance  minister  and so  there's  a lot  of  saber  rattling  both  economic  and  military  going  on  and  clearly  it's  not  a  contrail  like  the  media  tried  to  spin  it  later  some  type  of  powerful  missile  was  launched  off the  coast  we only  have  territorial  waters  12 miles  out  what would 
[02:30:30]  be the  upside  of them  not  acknowledging  that that's  exactly  what it  is  and letting  the people  know that  a foreign  country is  launching  test missiles  right off  our beach  well it was  only in a few  newspapers that  North Korea  actually fired  a test missile  and that it  broke up and parts  of it rained  down on Alaska  10 years ago  off the coast of  California though  in this day and age  it's a little much  like what's the  upside of them  keeping it secret  well the  upside is the  government likes  to play like  their god and  are all  controlling and  all powerful  and can protect 
[02:31:00]  us and  governments do  these type of  things really on  a routine basis  to menace each  other and so  it is a  escalation  kind of a  threatening  form of  diplomacy  look you can  just search  this or you've  probably seen it  you guys are  newshounds  we keep hearing  about off the  coast of  Florida in  the Atlantic  or off the  coast of  Japan  or in the  Persian Gulf  Chinese and  Russian subs  popping up  right behind  our aircraft  carriers  and then it's 
[02:31:30]  become a big  deal because  and some  admirals have  even gotten  in trouble  because with  the advanced  sonar  you know  how are they  letting the  Chinese and  the Russians  basically shadow  and minish  the fleets  and so  this is all  just a form  of brinksmanship  hearkening  back to  the cold  war  I remember  back in the  cold war  when we were  kids or  teenagers  it was always  on the news  about the  US was  sending  submarines over  to cut  communication 
[02:32:00]  cables  to the  Russians  and they  had subs  and then the  Kursk  and our  submarines  running into  their  submarines  and I  mean this  is just  an ongoing  thing  and basically  the cold  war type  tensions  are kicking  back up  but I was  speculating  about this  being Russia  China or  North Korea  mainly China  or North Korea  because it's  in the Pacific  and that's  their sphere  of influence  they didn't  really do  it in areas  that they  consider to  be their  turf  remember the  Chinese  you know  basically  flying some 
[02:32:30]  of their  aircraft  into the  C-130  surveillance  or AWAC  actually  and then  forcing it  down  I mean  this is  just  ongoing  type  behavior  but what  we do  know is  former  top brass  in the  Pentagon  I want  I'm a  chairman  of the  Joint Chiefs  of Staff  and members  of NASA  have come  out and  laughed  and said  that's  obviously  a giant  missile  trail  some  type  of ship  or submarine  launch  system  it looks  just like  a Polaris  nuke launch 
[02:33:00]  and we  know  that  if you  go back  to  Bill Clinton  he got  in a lot  of trouble  for helping  transfer  through  Laurel  and Hughes  the missile  systems  to North Korea  and China  so yeah  I understand  the missile  system  but do you  honestly think  North Korea  has nuclear  sub capability  I'm not saying  it was a nuclear  sub  they've got a  bunch of  diesel subs  many of our 
[02:33:30]  subs are diesel  because they tend  to be more  reliable in many  cases and don't  take as much  maintenance  I'm saying  they launched  a warhead  free drone  missile is what  they're called  yeah yeah  but I like  they even have  the technology  enough to  launch a  missile from  a submarine  at this  point because  their launches  really are  kind of archaic  when you look  at their  land  they've done  submarine launch  tests  they're off  their coast  over Japan  and they've  done ground  based  and a lot  of their  it's their 
[02:34:00]  long range  8,000 mile  ICBMs  that rarely  make it into  orbit  and so you're  right  look I don't  know  I mean  in fact I  haven't really  covered this  much  on Infowars.com  and PrisonPlanet.com  or on my own  little radio show  because when I  can't document  something I don't  really talk about  it much  you guys raised  it it's kind of  like the alien  thing I don't  really cover aliens  because I can't  prove it one way  or the other  what do you think  about Jesse the  body Ventura's  show a conspiracy  theory have you 
[02:34:30]  caught this thing  I mean I think  it's pretty  informative but  also entertaining  for the general  public I'm actually  a consultant on it  and I'm in the  next four episodes  coming up  in fact this  this Friday  9pm central  it's the police  state series  we actually have  an article  up on Infowars.com  dealing with this  and it's  bombshell FEMA  camps confirmed  and we actually  went out to some  FEMA camps  myself and the 
[02:35:00]  governor  and got threatened  with arrest  and other things  so it's  hey Alex  are the FEMA  camps  like  are they  being loaded  up now  or are they  getting ready  to get loaded  up  ok let me be  specific  and it's  free online  on YouTube  it's police  state for the  rise of FEMA  I released it  six months ago  police state for  the rise of FEMA  it was good too  I like that one  and it takes  two hours to go  over the whole  history of it  to show the  congressional 
[02:35:30]  hearings where  they admit the  FEMA camps  to show the  mainstream news  articles and to  show people  facilities that  are designated  as quote  emergency centers  mind control  mind control  I was a  former governor  a fighter  I've seen  things you  people wouldn't  believe  I'm a former  Navy SEAL  a governor  a fighter  you know what 
[02:36:00]  hold on  hold on  was that fucking  Alex with a  sense of human  god damn  god bless  him  our problem  with the  Jesse Ventura  conspiracy show  is he doesn't  get into any  real shit  like we want  him to step  over the line  during the  Area 51  episode  Jesse Ventura  goes head to  head with  Area 51  security  I'm standing  here but I'm  turning around  I'm not going  to be shot  what happened  Jesse  hey hey  listen  listen  listen  Jesse Ventura  guys  let me just  say something  about Ventura 
[02:36:30]  he's been on  your show  quite a few  times  I know you  guys had  that controversy  with him  but I've  known him  we want him  back  I've known him  really well  I've known him  really well  for about five  years  spent a lot  of time  with him  he really  is for real  it isn't  a tough  guy act  and you  know  he's an  older guy  you know  he is  grumpy  sometimes  I'm on my  way to  Plum Island  there's a  dinghy  following me  turn around  the issue  is he's  real  he's a  great guy 
[02:37:00]  he's  and  he was  just  tired  that morning  whenever  you guys  basically  had your  attack  schnauzer  on him  and  attack  schnauzer  unfortunately  the video  doesn't do it  justice  it was about  an hour  of going  back and forth  Jesse was  being pretty  obnoxious  to Jimmy  wouldn't answer  questions  no he was  sitting there  he wasn't  letting him  finish  oh my god  he certainly  was  can you  can you  give me  an idea  of  who  who may 
[02:37:30]  be going  to a  FEMA camp  like what  do you  have to  be doing  is it  is it  extreme  let me  tell you  Patrice  is it  extreme  or  Patrice  the FEMA  camps  the FEMA  camps  are real  Patrice  I'm a  governor  and they  wouldn't  let me  into the  camp  they won't  let me  into the  reactor room  at the  nuclear  reactor  what does  that  tell  you  perhaps  that  there's  radioactivity  in there  they don't  need you  going in 
[02:38:00]  there  Jesse  and the  Plum Island  one  come on  there was  no boats  following them  there was  a boat  way in  the distance  sir  you're not  even  oh that's  not true  let me  tell you  we saw  it  there was  a little  zodiac  let me  tell you  what happened  with that  they couldn't  get anybody  to even  rent them  a boat  to go  out there  Plum Island  is no joke  but that's  the guy's  livelihood  all the  people's  livelihood  they're not  going to  risk  getting  in trouble  going to  Plum Island  because it  is a  facility  you're not 
[02:38:30]  allowed on  Ventura  never asked  them to  even get  near it  they just  wanted to be  able to  basically go  over into  legal waters  you're supposed  to stay a mile  away  and let me tell you  Plum Island  is no joke  they have  36  because I was a  consultant on that  show  I sent them  the info  36  level 4  bioweapons  labs  let me  shift  here  because this  is important  previously  they would  have these  things in  the middle  of the  desert  or on  islands  level 4  are things  like  smallpox  Ebola 
[02:39:00]  anthrax  but worse  that's only  level 3  when they  weaponize  them  or soup  them up  supercharge  them  they're now  level 4  now  just 150  miles or so  from where I  sit in  Galveston  Texas  hurricane  ravaged  very dangerous  place to put  one  they have  put at the  University of  Texas at  Galveston  a level  4  bioweapons  lab  get this  in level  2 
[02:39:30]  containment  level 2  is just  when you're  dealing with  like the  regular  seasonal flu  or something  or a  regular cold  why would  they do  that  well let me  break that  down  they have  spent 6  billion dollars  in the last  9 years  on what they  call bio  shield  and even  the Washington  Post  the Baltimore  Sun have  reported  that these  are  factories  making  bioweapons  and developing  bioweapons  but it was  sold to  Congress  as defense 
[02:40:00]  and now  all over  the country  San Antonio  Texas  the list  goes on  and on  they have  level 4  listen  level 4  is supposed  to be  3 rows  of barbed wire  minefields  machine gun  nest  and be at  least  I'm not  joking  totally contained  with a  self-destruct  system  to burn  it out  and 3 stories  underground  now  they've got  level 4  behind little  glass windows  on the 
[02:40:30]  coast  of Texas  now  Lyme's  disease  it's been  confirmed  was leaked  out of  there at  Plum Island  the West  Nile  those are  just level  3 type  things  I'm telling  you  this is a  hard  core  issue  these  bioweapons  when you  understand  that the  Rockefeller  Foundation  why they're  doing this  why would  they do  that then  what's the  plan  what's the  end game  and if you  guys want  this stuff  because I  didn't know  you were  bringing up  bioweapons  I can send  it to you  it's up 
[02:41:00]  on  infowars.com  just type  in  Rockefeller  Foundation  developed  vaccines  to sterilize  and we've  got all  the government  documents  UN  Club of  Rome  Biological  Diversity  Assessment  where the  globalists  openly say  well you guys  know about  Ian Fleming  or whatever his  name was  that wrote  the James  Bond  movies  he was  a member  of OSS  and then  MI6  well notice  he wrote  the book  Moon Raker  now the  movie  Moon Raker 
[02:41:30]  with Roger  Morris  cheesy  with Jaws  and all  the rest  of it  but you've  got this  elitist  industrialist  who's going  to release  a bioweapon  to kill  everybody  on earth  then they're  going to  come back  to the  planet  and repopulate  it with  the super  race  now all  of that  is based  on real  government  plans  but they're  not going  off world  to do  it  they've  got giant  underground  bunkers  that they've  spent  trillions  of dollars  on  since the  1950s  let me just  throw one  out  but  sir  wasn't  every 
[02:42:00]  James Bond  a super  criminal  that was  trying to  do something  to the  world  like that's  every  no I know  but what I'm  saying is  that's true  because the  one before  that the  spy who  loved me  was trying  to kill  everybody  so he  can populate  the ocean  gold finger  wanted to  make all  the gold  radioactive  so he'd  have all  the gold  in the  world  yeah  that's  what I'm  telling you  is  a lot  of these  writers  he was a  member of  British  intelligence  they put  scenarios  that are  being discussed  or talked 
[02:42:30]  about  into films  I mean  it's kind  of like  the Wizard  of Oz  I had a  pretty big  filmmaker on  my show  a year ago  and I told  him  you know  the Wizard  of Oz  is about  the gold  standard  and the silver  standard  he thought  I was  joking  went out  and found  out  it's  mainstream  fact  really  and he's  now made  a movie  The Secret  of Oz  about that  that's airing  all over  television  worldwide  but the  issue is  yes  a lot  of things  that you  see in  movies  are basically  psychological  imprints 
[02:43:00]  or images  of what's  really being  developed  sisterhood  of the  traveling  pants  is about  the Fed  the Federal  Reserve  no it's  not  listen  Anthony  it's  mind  control  mind  control  they're  using  harp  we love  Jesse  by the way  I can't  stop  watching  his  show  when we  return  have you  seen  the 
[02:43:30]  parody  it is  one of  the  funniest  damn  things  hey  he's  moving  I'm  not  taking  a  plane  I'm  driving  it is  so  god damn  funny  that guy  nailed  him  it was  really good  I can't  but they  really do  over dramatize  what Jesse's  going to  do  and then  what really  happens  Jesse Ventura  faces a  line of  M16s  as he  tries to  get into  some of  the most  classified  locations  are they  there  yes  governor  all right  let's  go home 
[02:44:00]  I was  turning around  so I  could get  more info  they want  to shoot  me  the show  would be  huge  if he  got arrested  there  Alex  tell him  to get  arrested  across the  line  I will  tell you  with another  network  and I can't  talk about it  until it  comes out  early next  year  but on  another  even bigger  network  I'm not  going to  get into  it  I was  there  when people  got arrested  and I  escaped  I had to  jump in  a river  so  someone  did  is that  one 
[02:44:30]  hosted  by  Goldust  the ultimate  warrior  warrior  says  conspiracy  happens  I  am  the  warrior  Alex  knows  the whole  deal  warrior  says  warrior  says  infowars  dot com  listen  here

[02:45:30]  Guatemalan  men  women  and  children  with  live  syphilis  on purpose  and told  them that  it was  a vaccine  oh  you see  it was  already  declassified  they just  announced it  to act  like  oh we're  sorry  we got  caught  it didn't  just end  with poor  black folks  over 45  years being  injected with  civilists  men women  and children  in Tuskegee  it didn't  it didn't  just end  with  4300  US  foster  children  radiated  to death  just a few 
[02:46:00]  years ago  New York  Daily News  reported  that they  were taking  poor children  in New York  CPS  was  strapping  them down  in pesticide  studies  and killing  them  come on  child protective  services  they're injecting  Guatemalan kids  with syphilis  but they're not  they're not  giving pesticides  the little kids  come on  child protective  services  were taking  children  strapping  them down  and spraying  pesticides  on them  to see  what would  happen  no  CPS  would take  them  and then  put them  in a  residential 
[02:46:30]  system  controlled  by Big  Pharma  and they  would test  pesticides  on them  until  they  died  they would  also test  AIDS  drugs  on them  until  they  died  New York  Daily News  Alex let me  let me  squeeze in  for  let me ask  you this  question  because I  believe in  this type  of shit  okay  as we know  but  okay  why  do  one  thing  if  you're  them  why  put  it  on  memos  to  classify  or  declassify  if it's

[02:50:00]  fake  videos  yeah  we're  taking  the  veterans  death  benefits  what  are you  going  to do  about it  Alex  let me  ask you  this  though  in a  hypothetical  scenario  what is  it going  to take  would you  imagine  for  the  people  for  you know  all of  us to  go  oh  shit  this  is  real  like  what  could  possibly  happen  like  you're  telling  these  these  facts  that you  can find  but what  could happen  for everybody  to go  oh my god  this actually  exists  okay well  first do this 
[02:50:30]  what was the last  question I forgot about  what was the last  question I forgot about  why won't  anybody  like with these  memos  why do they  make these  why make memos  okay I wrote that  down now go back  to the new one  I'll answer the new  one first  the new one is  what's it going  to take  what's it going  to take  for everyone  to go  oh this  shit  is real  that it's not  just one  guy  that is  saying this  happened  like the  people  just to be  clear  just to be  clear  you guys  fucked up  we saw 
[02:51:00]  we saw the  guy behind  the curtain  we finally  saw it  when people  all wake up  and it's like  this is it  what's it going  to take  alright well  let me answer  the question  and I'm trying  to write these  down so I  have them  all here  you know  why make  memos  and what's  it going  to take  okay let's  go to  what's it  going to  take  let me  answer the  question  this way  do you  know about  titrating  the dose  okay so you're  going to answer  it by not  answering it  no I'm  going to  answer it  with precision  are you ready  for this  what  what do 
[02:51:30]  snake  handlers do  handle  snakes  and what do  they do  in case  they get  bit  they give  themselves  small amounts  of the  venom  and they  build it  up over  a few  months  until they  can take  a king  cobra  bite  and not  even  get a  headache  well that  answers it  for me  no no  this is  going to  answer it  yeah  that's  patrice  says  what is  it going  to take  okay  well they  know that  it's starting  to come out  because of  alternative media  so they're  titrating the 
[02:52:00]  dose  they're showing  us the man  behind the  curtain  but saying  he's nice  he brings  us popcorn  they are  they are  because the  alternative media  has shown the  man behind the  curtain  because they  can't deny  world government  or builder  group or  eugenics or  population  reduction  anymore  they're now  coming out  and showing  us more  and more  to acclimate  us and  to condition  us through  perception  management  to go  along with  it so  that as  it begins  to come  out that 
[02:52:30]  this is  almost all  staged  that  that that  people will  just be  basically  desensitized  right when  it does  finally come  out we'll  go eh  okay  do you hear  do you hear  like footsteps  in lonely  parking garages  at night  are you a  paranoid  gentleman  are you always  looking over  your shoulder  because of  all this  stuff  yeah that's  a good  question  and then I'll  go back to  the  make memo  type stuff  imagine  I'm a syndicated  radio host  just like you  guys  and I'm 
[02:53:00]  somebody who  I'm just trying  to put you  in my shoes  because I'm  also in your  shoes  I'm somebody  who goes out  and gives  public speeches  I'm somebody  who  I mean I do  lock my doors  at night  because I have  children  I want to  keep them  safe  but no  I'm the  opposite of  that  I'm not a  paranoid person  I'm a  realist  and I'm  bold  and I'm  a public  figure  and I'm  not living  in fear  I'm challenging  the new  world order  and then people  say well why  haven't they  killed you  then  because if  they kill  me it  underlines 
[02:53:30]  it highlights  it puts  ten exclamation  points behind  everything I'm  saying  I think if  they killed  you it's just  another little  bit of venom  that's all  that's right  just a little  bit of venom  to make it a  little easier  to get the  big bite  it would just  be food poisoning  or something  yeah yeah  it would be like  oh look at that  his brakes went  out  yeah that's weird  well I'm 36  and so I don't  think I'll be  down to a heart  attack anytime  soon but you  know you do  have a good  you're only 36  oh god  what's up with  the voice

[02:55:00]  and so I've  been I've been  to a doctor  about it  and they said  you need to  focus and speak  from the front  of your mouth  which I'm  trying to do  now  because if you  continue to  talk like you  really talk  from the back  of your throat  you're not  you're gonna  sound like a  dead toad  by the time  you're 50  so right now  I'm having to  consciously  talk like this  to not sound  deep voiced  because if I  actually talk  the way I talk  it sounds like  this  how do you  hurt your voice  when you're  talking out  your ass  Alex  that's one  for you  attack

[02:57:30]  let's get  serious  okay how  do I know  because actually  you guys are  right I can  see how that  sounded weird  there was a  secret hearing  and she went  public about  it  okay  Shibyl  Edmonds  along with  Lieutenant Colonel  Anthony Schaefer  I've interviewed  all these  people  and many  others  the government  said we  want to hear  what happened  on 9-11  from the NSA  and FBI  people  we want to  hear what  happened from  the FBI  agents  remember who  all went  public and  said look  we've got  gag orders  on us  from the 
[02:58:00]  closed  sessions  of the  House 9-11  commission  that was the  first commission  before the  Bush's  9-11  commission  but it  happened in  both  and they  said we  want to  hear what  you have  to say  and then  after they  would tell  them what  they'd seen  they'd say  you're now  sworn to  national security  secrecy  you will be  arrested if  you tell  anyone  so it was  a way of  oh tell  me what  you know  and it's  like okay  now you  can go  and then  the mob  shoots you  in the back  of the head  but this  is a  political  shoot you  in the back  of the head  and that's  why six  of the ten  commissioners  of the  9-11  commission  have now  gone public 
[02:58:30]  saying the  official story  is a lie  and there  was quote  the pentagon  cover up  source  washington  post  now  but how  do i know  about this  sybil  edmunds  fbi  translator  with nsa  transcripts  listening to  al qaeda  and she's  now broken  her gag  order  that means  she could  go to jail  but she  challenged  him  eight years  after her  gag order  last year  she went  public  and said  look  i was  listening  to these  transmissions  it was  mercenaries  dealing drugs  and weapons 
[02:59:00]  it was al qaeda  working with  the cia  the taliban  it was  bin laden  taking orders  from high  level cia  this was  insane  and that's  what we get  from the other  whistleblowers  now she was  listening to  these and  then  stratus ivy  and abel  danger run  by lieutenant  colonel anthony  schaefer  and you know  the pentagon  blacked out  most of his  book  he was at  he was running  a pentagon  hit team  because there's  dark side  and light side  the good guys  they knew  where bin laden  was and  where all  these guys 
[02:59:30]  were  they were  ready to  kill him  repeatedly  they were  always ordered  to stand  down by  the cia  and quote  contractors  now  now in  federal court  two months  ago it  comes out  that what  is blackwater  doing  they're involved  in guns  and drugs  and drugs  and trafficking  all over  this came out  in federal  court  it's now  come out  that navy  seals  what the hell  is that  that must have  been on your  end  that wasn't  on my end  anyways navy  navy seals 
[03:00:00]  have just  been arrested  in the  u.s.  selling  hangar  oh my  god  i've  gotta  go  get  them  not a  navy  seal  no  no one  gets  left  behind  and then  what  happened  remember  alex  i'm a  navy  seal  what is  going on  has he  answered  one  question  i'm  confused  i don't  know  this  i totally  answered  your  hold on  i totally  answered  your question  i totally  answered  your question  lieutenant  colonel  anthony  shaffer  on record  they blacked  out his  book  but i  can't 
[03:00:30]  okay  he testified  in secret  civil edmunds  testified in  secret  she's now  broken her  gag order  she's now  broken it  that's how i  know about  the secret  meeting  how about  the memo  the memo  and the  question is  why  why these  memos that  can be traced  back to  classify or  declassify  when it's  like you  watch these  movies and  it's like  like say a  scene in  good  goodfellas  where we  all rob a  bank and 
[03:01:00]  then everybody  gets killed  and then  everybody gets  killed or  yeah like  where they  can just  hide it  and still  that did  happen with  kennedy  hundreds and  hundreds of  people who  were witnesses  of the  grassy knoll  the people  on the  trains and  the train  conducting  tower all  went bye  bye all  got you  know multiple  caps just  like good  old lee  harvey  oswald  old jack  ribby took  care of him  real quick  now yes  now now  expanding on  that let me  answer that  question we  were once a  freer nation  in certain  respects we  were more  unfree but 
[03:01:30]  more free in  other ways  imagine the  cia is  founded in  1947 out of  the oss  and i'm gonna  answer your  question that's  how i answer it  the cia was  the cia was  founded and  everybody said  you're gonna  let a group  have billions  of dollars  and operate  in total  secrecy  okay they  can't operate  in the u.s.  and everything  that these  national security  groups not  just the cia but  now 16 other  agencies does  it's got to be  declassified every  10 years  well now they  make it 20  or in some 
[03:02:00]  cases 40  they've reclassified  the jfk assassination  out to you know  2040 it was  supposed to be  declassified all  of it next  year uh and  so we have  four-year request  freedom of  information act  but you know i  sent mine off  repeatedly the  fbi wait a minute  wait a minute so  in 2040 there's  going to be papers  that come out and  kind of go all  right this guy was  up here this guy  was we had six  agents here we  we we uh called  off some of the  some of the uh  uh the per his  personal protection 
[03:02:30]  yeah we had a  so it's going to  be uh uh some  papers that's going  to say all right  here it is  everybody yeah but  but i mean  let me explain  that this is a  bureaucracy with  with with with  millions of  millions of  employees okay  and there are  millions of  people uh  involved in  all of this  and it's  basically all a  psychological  operation most  people in  government are  good most  people in  private industry  are good i  mean they're  not perfect but  you know they  wouldn't do 
[03:03:00]  really horrible  things they  have some  morals so they  have i've  discovered from  something that  has been  declassified  they they  you know shoot  pregnant women  up with uranium  and plutonium  that's declassified  they radiate  small children  they spray  nerve gas on  u.s.  troops and  project shat  and kill them  and tell their  families they  die to the  flu not to  test the nerve  gas they can  test it on  rhesus monkeys  or rats that  have almost the  exact same uh  you know a  metabolic system  you know something  kills a rat it's  going to kill a  human something 
[03:03:30]  kills a dog it's  going to kill a  human they  they don't need  to test it  the the the  reason they're  testing chemicals  yeah the reason  they're testing  chemicals and  biologicals on  people is to  create cadres and  groups of  psychopaths who  they know will  follow orders and  who they've already  compromised so  they can have  them then go run  even bigger  divisions and  then give people  psychological  questionnaires and  things and then  test them and  see if they will 
[03:04:00]  be involved in all  this evil  i mean here's an  example of how  they take a young  special forces  what question are  we answering i'm  so confused  okay you asked  me about the  memo you asked  me why they have  memos yeah yeah  now we're talking  about telling you  it's because they've  got a large command  and control structure  okay just like you  guys have probably  got a memo hanging  up in the bathroom  you know saying  don't crap on the  floor because i bet  some of you do that  listen to your show  it's about blowjobs  actually i'm just  joking the point is  i'm sure exactly 
[03:04:30]  you got to put a  memo up and uh  so so that's the  bottom line and  then i was explaining  the psychology of  of how they take a  young special forces  captain who's 25  years old we might  not be as smart as  this guy i know i i  do well he's very  well well researched  and but well read  yeah you're very well  read alex well i'm  but listen guys i'm  not really that well  read all right some  people are experts on  harry potter or  they're experts on the  nfl oh martha or  they're experts they're 
[03:05:00]  experts in gardening  listen you can't  listen all this stuff  is it so much stuff is  admitted right there  are over ten thousand  declassified examples  you know how many times  they've released nerve  gas in the new york  subway eight hundred  and six no more than  twenty times do you  know how many times  they've released  bioweapons in the new  york subway are you  kidding me now how do  people heard well way  with that listen you  have a computer in  front of you right  yes i do okay just  search biological 
[03:05:30]  experiments new york  subway 1968 68 oh  okay i could buy it's  19 but remember they  only declassify this  now every 30 to 40  years but yes they  probably did they  probably did it makes  no fucking sense to  class like it make to  do some horrible shit  that's secret right and  then follow the rules of  declassifying or  classify it just makes  no it's no it makes  perfect sense if you're  a psychological warfare  chief with 180 iq 
[03:06:00]  snake okay now what i  see is army germ  warfare experiment in  new york subway system  now that could be  anything from dumping  anthrax on people or  baby just studying a  group dynamic can  actually now now we  know what happened  with it but it could  be they released a  bacterium and it was a  test the the the the  army doctors were  told to see how it  spread but but it  was really a test to  see if they would go  along with it and they 
[03:06:30]  had army doctors posing  as regular doctors in  all the local hospitals  and then they didn't  give people treatment  because they wanted to  watch them die just like  injecting little  guatemalans with syphilis  oh but the government  wouldn't commit 9-11  and to keep this  information that's great  like to i know they do  it but it's like to keep  this information let me go  further to just go like to  just go memo hey look  look at it they keep it to  go what like hey look  look at the shit we used  to do yeah like why even 
[03:07:00]  keep that as stuff something  you can fucking flash paper  yeah it's just weird to keep  this info it's like it's how  many people involved with  this this mess you know i'm  saying too many people  involved i think for to  legitimately get away with  this for so long it's like  i understand there have  been no no no no i need  to get to the key there's  definitely things that have  been done by the government  that have been shady and  underhanded especially during  the cold war absolutely but 
[03:07:30]  um i don't think it goes as  deep or as far as as uh you  and and the people that think  he's gonna get to the key  though okay can they get to  the key the key is this they  are practicing total insane  evil awesome out in the open  to break our will you ever  seen that hbo documentary  about pimps and hoes i love  it and uh the the woman's  been run over by a car or  whatever she's in the  hospital and she's all broke  up she's going baby baby i'm 
[03:08:00]  on i'm gonna get back up on my  feet i'm gonna get you that  money i'm gonna do whatever i  got to for you baby i'll do  whatever it takes and and then  the mother's sitting there  going what have you done to  my baby and then they turn to  him and they say well listen  how much do you pay her and  he goes i don't pay her  nothing she's lucky if i give  her some chicken once a week  yeah because that's it's it's  really female psychology so  you're saying we're all just  hoes we're all bitches 
[03:08:30]  beaten hoes and so and so  they're urinating on us they're  going you know what uh the  army's own manuals and the  former head of the du program  says if the troops inhale one  micron of du on average it'll  kill them in 11 years with lung  cancer and the troops are  dying of mass in the last few  wars our troops are now using  it over there and almost all the  ammunition 20 years ago they  wouldn't use it but here on  veterans day i you know now they  just say hey use it and when you  die uh what did bloomberg 
[03:09:00]  report two months ago that  prudential and other insurance  carriers signed a secret deal  with the va 11 years ago to  take the death benefits that  that the troops have paid for  their insurance uh through the  va from world war ii through to  today and steal their death  benefits and their widows and  widowers are told you ain't  getting jacked you know what that  is it's baby i won't get up on my  feet soon for you i just can't  wait to get back to work for you  right now how do they get away  with uh taking the death  benefits they just do it how do  they get away how do they get 
[03:09:30]  away taking abc news with illegal  aliens are allowed to go through  tsa without being checked how do  they let illegal aliens rent  aircraft without any id abc news  how do they leave the borders  wide open but say we've got to  grope two-year-old babies and  women and squeeze their squeeze  it's now the enhance it's always  more more more it's an act of  submission it's an it's the cult of  worshiping jack boots and and  worshiping but i said that and  but alex i said this i said this 
[03:10:00]  when i was on your show man it  really is our fault we we look at  these people we we look at these  people that do that to us as if  they're not people but we have to be  willing to do that shit to each  other it has to be a guy willing to  cough a two-year-old baby two-year-old  babies fucking nuts at the at the  airport this can't happen with just  some old generals that make  decisions it has to be a fucking  scientist who's willing to fucking  make a bio weapon exactly and that's 
[03:10:30]  the key they're looking for their  brothers they're looking for their  fellow psychopaths they may be i  may be white they may be black they  may be japanese they're looking for  fellow psychopaths all right how do i  get in on this then how do i get a guy  how do you get on the inside of this  whole fucking thing i don't want to  be on the outside i'll tell you the  quickest way to get on the inside  help out the quickest way to get on  the inside yeah join the navy get into 
[03:11:00]  the navy seals join the army and get  into the rangers and then and then and  then become a green beret i think i can  do that let them know that you want to  be corrupt what are the hours well i  mean let me tell you the listen i've  had family listen i've had family  recruited into this this is real yeah  hear this yes yes of course i hear it  all i asked the goddamn question the  quickest way to join the new world  order as a on-the-ground drug-dealing  true gangster murderer yeah is to join  u.s special forces and then they will 
[03:11:30]  psychologically profile you and if you're  a good guy they'll say oh oh you're a  good guy and you'll end up going and  doing good guy stuff but if you're a  bad guy they will progress through they  will send you to chicago or miami like  they did one of my great uncles and he  got out of he said they said we want  you to join the cia we're sheep dipping  you as an army officer as they call it  and next they wanted him to narcotics  traffic and do even more serious things  in chicago and he said no and got out 
[03:12:00]  most of them say no but the the fastest  way to join the new world order is to get  into special forces and then uh after you  get sheep dipped and are now working for  intelligence it's kind of like in the  movie no way out when kevin coster says  who are these men and they say they're  men formerly associated with special  forces so you'll basically be a killer in  a suit and and and then to really  progress they're going to say all right  we want you to go down here to  guatemala we want you to go down here to 
[03:12:30]  nigeria this minister didn't do what we  want we want you to go in and we want  you to gut their children and and paint  bloody pentagrams on the walls and then  if you go murder the children you're  going to progress up you're going to  have a whole hit team under you you're  going to have a house at maui you're  going to be shipping coke is this kind of  is this kind of like manchurian  candidate kind of thing no they don't  need to turn you into mind control slave  because all they've got to do is find  evil people that want to roll with the  devil who are the people that pick the 
[03:13:00]  bad people they're psychological warfare  experts yeah they got fucking experts i  want to be one of those guys i want to  be above them i want can you do can you  do 50 pull-ups in a row oh yeah can you  freeze see first they got to take you  first they got to take you off the farm  first they got to take you off the farm  first they got to take you off the farm  and make sure you're an absolute  badass who can sit there so you know  wait a minute wait a minute so the guys  wait a minute so the old guys at the top  used to be and physical maniacs and 
[03:13:30]  and they've just progressed into old  dudes who know how to train physical  man like world war two guys yes in fact  you talked about kennedy i was actually  given this three years ago even before  rolling stone uh carried it anymore and  and and uh yeah this ties into it you  just brought up old world war two  many action yes okay e e howard hunt who  is the admitted i mean ethan hunt of  mission impossible is admittedly named 
[03:14:00]  after him ethan hunt yeah in that movie  is named after e howard hunt turd  howard hunt one of the nixon's guys yeah  admitted former head of black op overthrow  operations play that game in in in world  war ii think that it in world war ii over 50  confirmed sniper kills yeah in in in china  against the japanese so he's a world war  too badass they take him in he runs black  op hit squads he overthrows 11 separate  nations and he was uh it came out

[03:15:00]  uh you know he was the tramps with all  the guns and the boxcar and they were  ordered to release them uh and it's e  howard hunt you know photo that was in  that and that uh group uh e howard hunt  gave a deathbed confession and admitted  they ran the whole lot  and by the way speaking of conspiracy  theory that's going to air not this  friday but next friday yes i know i saw  that one uh well i saw the last one on  wall street and i saw the um we've got a  confession yeah ah i like when he walks 
[03:15:30]  in on all the people on wall street  aha i got you i got you much fucking  info man it's just got to be like one  thing that we all got to like kind of  got to follow like it's just too much  detail here's one thing you can do right  now one fucking thing we could all do  where you could start people off and go  look at this and this will get you going  give us the kindergarten of uh what we  can do okay  10 years ago 15 years ago i was  interviewing top toxicologists former 
[03:16:00]  epa scientists current epa scientists  people who are concerned over 90 percent  of the epa scientists in 2000 and 2005  wrote letters their official union voted  to say sodium fluoride in the water reduces  iq by 10 to 20 points it doubles bone  cancer it is a chemical weapon take it out  of the water and it damages teeth and  causes dental fluorosis the same unions  have come out and said that bisphenol a in  plastic is feminizing men making girls go 
[03:16:30]  into puberty early and massively increasing  cancer because it's a female hormone makes  women more female makes men feminine now  people always laughed at us about that  now four states have banned it it was  engineered through a u.n agreement they  have thousands of different combinations  of ways to make plastic without it almost  all plastic that you drink or eat out of  and when you microwave a tv dinner it's  bisphenol a plastic it off gases it in you 
[03:17:00]  know into your salisbury steak and mac and  cheese and this is why we're so obese you  know the food ties into it this is why  we're so unhealthy it's why diabetes is  up by three thousand percent they have put  soft kill chemical weapons in the plastic  and in the water and everybody can start  realizing this and start filtering your  water with a special type filters that  actually take the fluoride out you got  there's different types you have to check  it though because all filters don't do it  you can stop eating and drinking out of 
[03:17:30]  bisphenol a you can realize that gmo crops  in every study just search uh gmo corn  causes organ failure just every major  variety it's engineered in by design we  are being soft killed right now that's  the biggest issue and it's covered my  film end game blueprint for global  enslavement it is free on youtube and  google just google end game and it's the  top link uh there please gentlemen please  and there's an online bibliography what is
