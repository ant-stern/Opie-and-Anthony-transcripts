<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a declaration of their intention to be unapologetically rude and offensive.  The show began with vulgar jokes and sexually suggestive humor, immediately punctuated by complaints about the incessant playing of "Boogie Oogie Oogie" from a nearby radio station.  A substantial portion focused on Busty Hart, a previous guest known for her breast-based stunts, and a humorous anecdote about her injuring Opie's wrist.  A disastrous ventriloquist act performed by a colleague, Pat (who was in the studio), was also shown and heavily mocked.  

The hosts then transitioned to several news topics, including A-Rod's impending divorce and rumors of affairs (specifically with Madonna), Peter Cook's pornography habits, and a critical discussion of President Obama's use of a reportedly problematic MD-80 charter plane, detailing a near-miss involving an emergency slide deployment.  A Chris Matthews interview segment highlighting a tense exchange with a Texas senator unable to list Obama's legislative achievements was played and dissected.  The show concluded with a self-deprecating, humorous segment detailing Anthony's disastrous wedding.

The broadcast continued with speculation about Barack Obama's presidential candidacy, expressing support for a black president while admitting a lack of policy knowledge.  They discussed high gas prices, contrasting Obama and McCain's energy policies (offshore drilling, alternative energy), and segued into a humorous critique of American presidents holding hands with other men. A previously aired bit about oil prices and oil spills was revisited, followed by criticisms of Middle Eastern oil-producing countries and a desire for US energy independence.  Another segment featuring the Chris Matthews interview (previously mentioned) was re-analyzed, focusing on Matthews’ perceived bias and the lack of public awareness of the candidates' platforms.  Sam Roberts' "Primetime Gossip" segment delivered celebrity news and rumors. The high cost of gas sparked more humorous, outlandish solutions (e.g., giant house hats).  A news story about a man using vegetable oil as car fuel led to a discussion of "vegetable oil burglars."  A “cute pet” segment featured disturbing stories (a bisected Chihuahua, a dog chewing off a woman's toe), prompting dark humor about animal predation and pets consuming deceased owners.  A hostile phone call with Dawn, who requested Tom Waits music, ended with her angrily hanging up after being mocked. The show returned to the Chris Matthews segment and Obama's surprising Iowa caucus victory, highlighting the hosts’ initial skepticism.  A brief discussion about "The White Shadow" and commercials targeting older audiences preceded a mention of their upcoming tour and a story about a urophiliac, Alan Patton, who collected urine from young boys.

The show proceeded with a segment featuring several angry and vulgar voicemails from the "F.U. Line."  The hosts then discussed WOW stickers, the Running of the Bulls (with calls for violence against participants), and a news story about a 38-year-old sex offender kidnapping a 14-year-old girl, resulting in a car chase and the girl's hospitalization.  The hosts' outrage and dark humor touched upon the justice system's handling of sex offenders.  A discussion about birthday gifts (or lack thereof) ensued, including Anthony's purchase of matching .50 caliber Desert Eagle handguns for himself and a friend (with a brief video showcasing the recoil). Gene Simmons' book-signing policy was debated, along with analysis of a Vince McMahon wrestling injury storyline and various news clips.  A significant portion centered on a conflict between Opie, Anthony, and producer Steve, culminating in Opie pouring water on Steve's back due to his perceived lack of improvisational skills.  The segment concluded with continued tension between the hosts and Steve.

A further segment focused on workplace dynamics and on-air/off-air behavior.  Steve expressed discomfort with the hosts' frequent on-air insults (including homophobic slurs and accusations of incompetence), noting that this translated into off-air interactions.  The hosts mostly deflected these accusations.  A discussion about a staff member, Eroc, and his strong body odor ("swamp ass," diarrhea) followed, culminating in Travis smelling Eroc's crotch and ball bag, which reportedly smelled of vinegar chips.  A phone call with Anthony's "gun guy" led to further vulgar language and a discussion about gun modifications. ELO (via phone call) joined the conversation discussing workplace dynamics and a company merger, clarifying that on-air comments were acceptable unless causing off-air conflict.  A phone call with Bob, a new British intern, provided comedic relief with his attempts at an English accent.  The Vince McMahon injury was further discussed, along with analysis of pictures of Adrian Barbeau, focusing on her breasts.

The final segment featured a discussion of Mickey James and speculation about breast reduction surgery.  The "Line of the Day" segment, sponsored by Carbonite, heavily featured Bob, the intern, whose thick British accent and awkward delivery provided comedic moments while reading entries.  Listener-submitted lines (many containing crude humor and sexual innuendo) were read, culminating in Bob’s difficult attempt to sing Oasis's "Wonderwall."  Eastside Dave contributed a pre-recorded bit about interacting with rock stars (involving inappropriate actions).  The show ended with Bob’s departure and final awkward interactions with the hosts and Jimmy.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shot shots, Opie and Anthony.  Alright, we get it.  Pat, how's it going?  It's going forward!  Tor Johnson, bobbing for gonorrhea.  All right, this is a bust, lesbians.  We're going to smell all of your fingers. 
[00:01:00]  If it smells like a day in the fishing hole, you're under arrest.  We're blithering idiots.  That's fine, though.  I want more of my it is-see.  It is-see.  It is-see.  I love you guys.  I suck all your f*** all day.  Wow.  Fine.  I think that's an endorsement.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  It sure is an endorsement. 
[00:01:30]  Indeed.  Good morning.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Morning.  On this 5-2 for Tuesday.  2-4?  Are they doing that over at, uh...  2-4s from all your favorite artists all morning long.  The station we're stuck sitting next to.  That stupid CBS FM.  Because I heard, um, uh, um, uh, Boogie Nights.  That's the song, Boogie Nights.  Yeah.  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  Dance with the boogie.  Get down.  And then you heard... 
[00:02:00]  Oogie Boogie.  ...Get down.  Boogie Oogie Oogie.  So, we were thinking perhaps it was a boogie two-fer.  I think they're doing boogie two-fers.  Two-fer boogie.  On CBS FM.  Here.  Don't be oldies station.  Here in New York.  Yeah.  I looked at Anthony.  We're going through...  How many papers every morning?  Five?  At least.  We're going through five newspapers, trying to get some tidbits for our fine radio show.  Working our butts off.  Trying to, like, show prep. 
[00:02:30]  And this guy, right on the other side of the wall, has time to crank up Oogie Boogie Oogie.  He was cranking Boogie Oogie Oogie.  It's Boogie Oogie Oogie?  Oh, Boogie Oogie Oogie.  He's cranking it and enjoying Oogie Oogie...  What is it?  Boogie Oogie...  Boogie Oogie Oogie?  Boogie Oogie Oogie.  Yeah, give me some...  On the floor.  Because we got a boogie.  Yeah.  Look it till you're done.  Stay in boogie no more.  And I'm sitting there and I'm getting jealous.  I'm like, this guy doesn't have a worry in the world. 
[00:03:00]  He can crank up Oogie Oogie Boogie.  And that's all he has to worry about.  Fantastic.  The walls are shaking as he's just shaking his hips.  Oogie Oogie Boogie.  Boogie Boogie Oogie Oogie.  Oh, Boogie Oogie what?  Yeah, Boogie Oogie Oogie.  Boogie Oogie Oogie.  I think he plays it loud.  I think he plays it loud so one day it'll drown out the sound of this.  You can barely hear it.  He'll just be, yeah, I've been playing Boogie Oogie Oogie my whole career. 
[00:03:30]  It's just drowning out the sadness that he never became anything in this business.  That's it, man.  Exactly.  How does it feel?  You're a jukebox.  You're a human jukebox.  Boogie Oogie Oogie.  I think that would be funny that nobody would even know he did anything until, like, the music just stopped and they opened it up and he was slumped over on the console. 
[00:04:00]  A brief note about how he's just not where he thought he'd be.  No.  He's been spinning the oldies for 50 years.  Has he?  Yeah.  What does that actually mean?  It means nothing.  So they're doing Boogie.  Get a little blurb in David Hinkley's column.  Yeah.  So these dopes are doing Boogie twofers as we're trying to, like, do the heavy lifting for all of radio.  Thanks.  Thanks for the help. 
[00:04:30]  And I don't understand this.  What's her name?  Who runs this joint?  Mara?  Mara.  Mara?  What's her name?  Mara Mason.  Mara.  We barely see this broad.  I think a little respect.  Yeah.  She's a broad in radio.  Oh, Jesus.  Listen to me.  Why did she have to put the CBS FM oldies studio right next to our office?  This is a big, big floor.  Yeah.  That thing could have gone anywhere.  Yeah.  Put it next to your office so you could hear Boogie twofers.  Boogie, oogie, oogie.  As you deal with your hangover or whatever the hell you do every morning. 
[00:05:00]  Jeez.  Woo.  Boogie, oogie, oogie, indeed.  Indeed, yes.  We might have to, like, go in there and assault them a little bit later this morning.  They weren't happy last time we did that.  That's fine.  Pretty sure.  Hey, E-Rock, if you hear one more boogie song, you're going in today.  Maybe it's like a boogie.  You're going in.  Do they do a boogie theme day where it's just songs with boogie in it?  I don't know. 
[00:05:30]  I really don't know.  That would become a term that people use for anything else but snot.  Yeah, they just ran out of things to do on regular radio.  Yeah.  I'd do a boogie twofer.  That should hold them over for seven minutes.  I'd do some traffic and weather together on the 8th.  That'll hold them over.  Yeah.  Let's do another A to Z type weekend.  Wonderful.  Wonderful.  Thanks.  Let's play every Elvis Presley song.  What the hell?  877-212-ON-A. 
[00:06:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  That's how we start today.  That's how you get in touch with us.  Our old pal, Busty Hart, just before we hit the old airwaves.  Oh, yeah.  I think Steve said it?  Yeah.  Yes.  Steve said it.  Busty Hart, go to YouTube.  What's the search there, E-Rock?  I want to turn people on to this immediately.  Yeah, America's Got Talent.  Busty Hart, uncensored.  Or just put Busty Hart in and look for the America's Got Talent clip. 
[00:06:30]  When did this go down?  Last night?  A couple days ago?  A couple days ago.  A couple days ago.  This is our old pal, Busty Hart.  She used to do our show back in the day.  And she's got massive boobies.  And of the silicone variety, I believe.  Oh, yeah.  That's not natural.  Yeah.  No, I know they're not natural, but I mean, silicone, the stuff that makes you kind of  like really heavy and hard.  Right.  And her whole deal is that she smashes things with her boobies. 
[00:07:00]  And she's been doing this on radio for many, many years.  She did it on our show back in the day, about 10 years ago or so.  Yeah.  She like grabs a breast.  It's usually her, what is it, her left one, or right one.  Her right one.  She grabs it and swings it around.  Yeah.  Like a blackjack.  Like this giant, oh, God.  She swings it around and just smashes things. 
[00:07:30]  Like tin cans.  She's not dainty about it whatsoever.  No, no, it's not like she lays it on there very lightly.  She smashes hard.  And she used to do one can.  And of course, David Hasselhoff has to be outrageous and then throw up the buzzer right  away.  The Hoff.  The stupid Hoff.  He is a douche.  What's the buzzer for?  That means you don't like what's going on.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You don't like this, David?  How about America's Got Talent? 
[00:08:00]  Some guy gets up there and lays on the floor drunk and eats a burger.  Would he buzz that one out?  Because, damn, that was entertaining.  Not if it's a German audience.  Oh, they love them.  Those Germans love them.  Oh, they love them.  So she's on stage with her big, huge, heavy, hard boobs.  And she's just smashing things.  And then she does kind of a karate thing where she goes through a bunch of boards with her  right boob. 
[00:08:30]  I think she favors her right side.  She does, yeah.  That right boob's got to be pretty damaged.  It is.  We saw it.  It's disgusting, actually.  It's misshapen and too big.  Yeah.  It's swollen.  Yeah.  And one day back when we were up in Boston, she came into the show and wanted to demonstrate  how she could crush a can, a single can.  But she needed somebody and someone to hold it because, you know, you don't want to tip  it over.  So Opie held it and she swung and crushed Opie's hand. 
[00:09:00]  It was, I officially had a sprained wrist from Busty Hart's boob.  Yeah.  Officially.  I had to go to the doctor and everything.  He said, it's not broken, but it is sprained.  Yep.  Who else could say they got a sprained wrist from a boob?  And then very shortly after that, a lawsuit came out that she was dancing at a strip club  and her act is just smashing things and getting topless and going behind guys and putting her 
[00:09:30]  boobs on their shoulders and things like that, you know, of that ilk.  And apparently she smashed some guy in the back of the head and gave him whiplash.  Well, one of her bits, I forgot what she does, but she, she puts something on the guy's head  and smashes it down.  So she kind of gave the guy like whiplash.  Yeah.  And compressed vertebrae and just really effed him up pretty bad.  Yeah.  She's a tool.  She really is. 
[00:10:00]  We kind of like her though.  And then she was part of that stunt where we duct taped one of our interns to a telephone  pole.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  We, we did that as well.  Does she have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame or is she just pointing to somebody?  She's a...  Let's say.  I don't know.  She's next to a star on the...  But I can't see what it says.  Miriam Hopkins?  Miriam, Miriam Hopkins?  Who's that?  Who is that?  Yeah, exactly.  Who is that?  So check out Busty Hart. 
[00:10:30]  She's an old pal.  Doing very well.  We'll have to get her back on the show when she's in New York.  How big are, are her boobs?  They're just ridiculous.  Yeah, they're, they're beyond measuring or giving a letter to, it just becomes incomprehensible  after a certain point.  They look like 58 double yucks.  So we were watching the Busty Hart video just before he came on the air today.  You can do the same.  YouTube, Busty Hart, America's Got Talent. 
[00:11:00]  It'll get you there.  It's on ONA.  Oh, it's on onaradio.com.  Very, very good.  All right.  How's everybody this morning?  All right.  Yeah?  Chipper.  Got a good night's sleep.  Very good.  Yeah.  That doesn't happen often?  It certainly doesn't.  I'm going to have to rectify that tonight.  I'm sure you, yeah, you get uncomfortable if you sleep too well.  Yeah.  And then went to the, uh, went to the gym for the first time in a little while. 
[00:11:30]  I've been, I've been shirking my gym responsibilities a little bit.  You know how it is.  Kind of out and about.  A little social butterfly these days, you know.  And, uh, and gotten to the gym as much as I wanted to.  So, uh, ow.  Oh, you're sore today?  Yeah, you always try to make it up in one day.  Yeah.  Let me make up what I've neglected to do for a while.  In the last month.  In like a day.  So you just do too much.  And I'm a little achy. 
[00:12:00]  You know what I do when I don't go to the gym for a while?  I just wear, like, tough t-shirts.  Is that it?  Yeah, I got, like, a UFC shirt on today.  So I'm good.  I don't need to go to the gym for another week or two.  You know something?  I wish I would have thought of that.  I wore a faggy little short-sleeved green number.  No, if you don't go to the gym, just find tough-looking t-shirts.  And it's just as good as working out.  Poor Anthony's sore.  You know how I'd like to make you feel a little better?  Have a mule just plant his feet into your back and arms. 
[00:12:30]  Ow.  Good kick from a mule.  What could be worse when you're sore from working out?  Oh, God.  A mule kick.  A mule.  Hey, for whatever kind of mule you want, Jim, put it on my back.  Oh, P.  Merck's got talent, had an Ozzy impersonator, and you have to show it to Jimmy so you can  see Sharon's reaction.  I guess the Osbournes, by the way, maybe we'll find that clip.  Oh, my God.  What are they doing?  I think it's a good idea.  Is it?  I really do.  It's a variety show, Jimmy. 
[00:13:00]  They're doing a variety show, the Osbournes.  Now, the variety genre was very popular in the 70s.  Like, anybody could get a goddamn variety show.  Who did one?  The Brady Bunch?  Oh, my God.  The Brady Bunch did an awful one.  Donnie Marie.  Donnie Marie.  That was one.  Glenn Campbell had a variety show.  Flip Wilson.  Yeah, Flip Wilson.  Belly Pardon.  I'm sure.  I'm sure Stunt Brain has more.  Go ahead, Stunt.  The Hudson Brothers had one.  The Hudson Brothers. 
[00:13:30]  Horrible.  How about a name that our audience can relate to?  How old are you?  The Manhattan Transfer Company.  What about Peaches and Herb, or the Fifth Dimension?  I think they did.  Tony Orlando and Dawn.  Tony Orlando and Dawn.  These are all that genre where they'd get someone, Sonny and Cher, the Smothers Brothers,  where they would get the hosts, who were the stars, and they would perform a little number  at the beginning, and then they'd have guests that would come on and do comedy sketches, and 
[00:14:00]  other musical numbers, and a little talk.  Yeah.  Banter.  Yeah.  Things like that.  That was the variety.  Dance numbers, too.  Yeah.  Were very popular.  Dance numbers.  This is a genre that died in the 70s because it sucked.  Well, it just had it.  It was for the time.  Yeah, but it had its day.  Because there was some type of stupid innocence that went along with only having like five channels 
[00:14:30]  to choose from.  And you had to wear bell bottoms that were really bright and colorful.  Sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Sha-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Yeah.  Just an awful type of show.  But see, everything comes back around, and I'm thinking that it's time for the variety  show to make a comeback.  And why not the Osboards?  What do we know about it?  Like, who's just them?  Do we know anything they're going to do with it, or is it just like the idea?  Basic variety show.  Yeah, they'll probably just have guests pop in and go like, 
[00:15:00]  Yo, who's coming in today to sing?  Yeah, but I think it's smart.  You'll have a comedian, maybe a band, some of these goofy acts.  I want to do comedy on the Osboards show.  Could you imagine if Jimmy got to do comedy on the Osboards variety show?  Imagine Jimmy bombing on the Osboards variety show.  Why would you bomb, Jimmy?  Fantastic.  Why would you bomb, Jimmy?  I'd be too nervous.  No, you'll be fine.  Would you?  Yeah.  Hum-na-hum-na-hum-na.  Yeah.  I'm done.  Yeah.  I have a joke with that.  Hi, Ozzy.  I'm wondering like a rookie. 
[00:15:30]  Just bringing up obscure things that he did in his career.  I'm doing master of reality jokes.  I hear four British boos.  Talk about a dress.  Was there a dress?  Something about a dress.  Yeah.  Steven S. from Bayshore writes,  Hey, Ope, you should get Pat from Munaki onto America's Got Talent  so he can show off that unique ventriloquist act he did yesterday over at XM.  Wow.  What?  Uh, I couldn't get to my vehicle quickly enough to turn on, uh, Pat from Munaki's show. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  It was Pat.  We just left Pat alone in the studio.  Yeah.  To, uh, kind of see, uh, his comedy chops.  What he had.  With no phone calls, no producers.  No.  Just Pat and a microphone.  Pat, a microphone, and maybe some newspapers that were scattered around to give him some ideas.  Yeah.  Holy mother of God.  It was the funniest, most tragic thing I've ever heard in my life. 
[00:16:30]  He bombed.  Just ate it.  But in a good way.  Like, it was, you couldn't turn it off.  It was a, such a bombing that I couldn't, I couldn't turn it off.  Yeah.  When it finally cut off in mid-sentence, he was in the middle of something, and it just  went like, pfft, Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  And, and, and it started an old bit.  I, I was, I was like disappointed.  I kind of wanted to hear more. 
[00:17:00]  You wanted more?  Because he was floundering.  It was just like watching someone drown.  With no one there to help him.  And the drowning takes, what, an hour?  Oh, it was, he was just, he was horrid.  Every time, like, the drowning victim tries to get out of the pool, you take a tablespoon  of water, and you hold it in their nose, and you'll stick to breathe.  Breathe.  Breathe this in.  Yeah, but the ventriloquist act.  Yeah.  Is that video anywhere?  It was so gay that it wasn't gay. 
[00:17:30]  If that makes sense.  Where he was talking.  Using another part of his body.  Yeah, he was using a part of his body where he would use two hands and open and close a  certain part of his body to speak.  I used to do it with my belly button back in the day.  And you'd go like, hey, how are you doing?  Do opera face and stuff.  You could do it with the belly button.  Or you could do it like Pat did it.  Yes.  Like a real man. 
[00:18:00]  And he did it for everybody on Pal Talk.  And it was the talk of the O&A community all afternoon.  People could not get over the shape of this guy.  Yeah.  It was the back of him looks like the front of a fat woman.  Really does.  It was that bad.  It looked like an elephant too, though.  Yeah.  It had this elephant look to it.  There was skin sagging where skin shouldn't be sagging.  Ah.  It was bizarre. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  Sorry, Pat.  I know you're listening.  Well, hi, guys.  Well, you know.  Oh, the video's being edited?  How do you edit that one?  I don't know.  Edited?  Why does it have to be pixelated?  That one you might have to go real deep to find.  I don't know if we could just throw that up on onaradio.com.  Oh, that'll turn up on websites and other things.  Yeah, it's in all the usual places.  I'm sure it'll be linked to our website, our official website that we can't promote. 
[00:19:00]  Somebody has the Millennium Falcon flying out of it.  Oh, God.  Looks like Pavarotti singing opera.  Oh.  So you might want to try to search that out today.  That one might be a little tougher to find, but it was...  That was a biggie yesterday.  Extremely funny.  All right.  We're just getting started.  877-212-ON-A.  Don't forget about onaradio.com. 
[00:19:30]  We'll do some A-Rod news next.  I guess A-Rod's wife went on a bit of a spending spree.  Oh, yeah?  So, and we'll get some expert advice from Anthony on this whole thing.  Yes.  Oh, been through it.  Good luck.  You're like, you should, you could be on all these, like, you could be one of these,  what are they called?  Like, like a spin doctor.  No, a pundit.  A pundit.  A pundit.  A pundit.  A pundit.  I called it a pundit once, and Jimmy corrected me.  It's a pundit. 
[00:20:00]  What do you learn on this show?  Oh, yeah.  What did you call it?  A pundit?  Pundit.  Yeah, yeah.  No, no, no.  Only fools put that last time.  That's why I did it.  Yeah, no, no.  A pundit is perfect.  I wanted to be a fool.  No.  Yeah, if we mispronounce words on this show, Jimmy makes us clench our teeth, and then  he takes, like, a ladle, a spoon, and hits us in the teeth really hard.  And guess what?  We don't mispronounce the word anymore.  It's a ladly.  A ladly?  Yes.  A ladle.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:20:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Broadcasting to the retarded.  Sexual innuendo.  All in all the girls.  Naughty radio show.  Yes, this is naughty.  That feels good, doesn't it?  What the hell are you roaring, you guys?  Opie and Anthony.  A lot's going on this morning.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:21:00]  Phones are lit, but if you want to get through a little later on, 877-212-0-&A.  Jimmy's got an update on something we started yesterday.  Well, before I get to that, I want to say I'm a traveling virus real quick.  Oh, yeah, sure.  August 2nd at PNCR Center.  It's the only show that we're doing this year.  And we do have a couple of comedians to mention that I forgot to mention yesterday  because I didn't have the list.  In addition to myself and Patrice and Bobby and Voss and Otto,  we also have Mike Birbiglia, Greg Giraldo, and Nick DiPaolo  have all been added to the show. 
[00:21:30]  And they're actually working on somebody else as well.  But this is going to be an amazing show.  It is August 2nd, and you can get tickets to Ticketmaster.  And it's amazing.  The fans are so good.  Possibly I was a little sensitive.  In the NBC blog, they had mentioned a bunch of celebrities, quote-unquote,  that were at the UFC fight.  And they had mentioned Jim Norton.  And in parentheses, it's like he's a comedian.  Does he count?  I'll let you decide.  So I was a little insulted being a baby and a comedian with no sense of humor. 
[00:22:00]  Considering all the work you're putting into your career, you were a bit...  No, but it's just amazing how I try to throw atomic bombs at people,  and somebody jokingly throws a jab at me, and I just cry like a bitch.  I just have my face slapped.  So I got...  Danny just gave me an email from Mike Chiappetta, who is the guy.  It says,  I'm the douche blogger that supposedly insulted Jim Norton.  I should have known better than using a throwaway line on an O&A personality,  since I've listened to the show since you guys came on to New York on NEW. 
[00:22:30]  Jay Moore was drawing maps of Hawaii, and you guys hosted the short-lived NFL pregame show.  Anyways...  XFL.  I wish it was the NFL.  Yeah, the NFL would have been nice.  Sure, yeah, my fault.  It was the failed one.  What that was called, by the way, that mistake was called,  so anxious to get back to my part, I just skipped everything else.  Yes, selfish little man.  And now we have a new problem.  Oh, sweetie.  The problem is he had to mention the XFL thing, 
[00:23:00]  so now Ant and I have a problem with this guy.  Hey, yeah.  He didn't have to do that.  And you guys hosted the short-lived XFL pregame show.  Anyway, no disrespect to Jim.  It was a three-second throwaway line in between matches.  But I just added another paragraph onto the original story to correct my mistake.  That reads,  Note, the emails are in, the people have spoken, and Jim Norton counts.  For whatever it's worth, I listened to O&A going back to NEW,  watched Lucky Louie and have seen Norton stand-up.  No disrespect intended, just wondering if most of mainstream America knew who he was. 
[00:23:30]  Turns out I'm the idiot.  I'm probably inviting more trouble by sending this email,  but you guys have made me laugh enough times in life  that I wanted you to know that you've definitely got my respect.  Sorry, Jim.  Regards, Mike.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  Thanks, Mike.  Wow.  Very cool.  So for fans that send emails, it's very appreciated, but, you know.  What a backpedaling douche this guy is.  And me.  I was perhaps a little sensitive, so thank you, Mike.  I'm perhaps a little sensitive.  It's amazing.  For a guy who just says anything, 
[00:24:00]  and all of a sudden somebody throws a light-hearted little titter at me,  and I just crawl up into a ball and beg for help.  That is hysterical, yeah.  You just, like, unload this son of a bitch.  Jim Norton's a little short.  Help me, fans!  Thank you, guys.  All right, let's get into the A-Rod news.  Everyone's talking about this whole thing.  Ooh, yeah.  Who knows?  I'm predicting probably 100, maybe 200 bucks he's going to have to cough up to his wife. 
[00:24:30]  At all?  Ooh.  The paperwork requesting dissolution of marriage was filed in Miami this morning.  The storied relationship between Alex Rodriguez and his wife Cynthia  that put them in the center of the spotlight from the minute he put on Yankee pinstripes  over.  In divorce papers, Cynthia calls their marriage irretrievably broken,  citing extramarital affairs and other marital misconduct.  Cynthia has made it very clear to me that she wants to take the high road 
[00:25:00]  and do the right thing and protect her children and herself.  Wow.  She's not taking the high road because they cover the Daily News here in New York,  her $100,000 revenge.  She wants to take the high road, but me as her lawyer will advise differently.  Please, the high road.  I'm figuring to make at least a million on this one alone.  In a highly publicized divorce case like this, there's no high road. 
[00:25:30]  If she was taking the high road, it wouldn't be all over the news.  You wouldn't hear about it.  It would be in secrecy.  You wouldn't have your lawyer talking to the media.  Bill Murray recently got divorced.  That was the high road.  That was, I guess, the high road because no one heard about it.  They just ended their marriage.  They split up some stuff.  He gave three houses to her or whatever.  Yeah.  And that was that.  It was like two weeks, something like that.  They already.  The worst done. 
[00:26:00]  I already heard like Ralph Felder is, I believe, part of her legal team.  I heard something on Wednesdays morning.  That lawyer was saying that because he's into that Kabbalah that Madonna is into,  that that is some type of cult and very dangerous to the children.  So they're already positioning this whole thing to take custody away or at least use it as a bargaining chip for more money. 
[00:26:30]  And, you know, I don't see her going out there and performing horribly in postseason.  She's not going one for 20 when she's needed.  Hitting another homer when the Yankees are up by 15 runs.  Yes, that's right.  Yeah.  And it's on A-Rod.  For A-Rod, the score is now 11-2 Yankees.  Doesn't hit a lot of homers when it's one-to-one in the ninth inning. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, why would he?  What a hero.  Solo shot in the eighth.  Thank you, stupid.  Just my opinion, but what I've read about this whole thing and this A-Rod character,  it doesn't seem like he would give a crap about the kids.  He'd pretty much be like, ah, take the kids, whatever.  And she's a dope because they had major problems in their marriage and she turned around and  had another kid.  That's an investment.  Yep.  That's an investment.  I don't think so because there's a prenup and they already had a kid.  Prenups.  How many investments do you?  Prenups don't cover, like, prenups don't cover the child, what the hell? 
[00:27:30]  All right, that's the reason to have the kid because of a prenup because a prenup will  never be a child.  All right.  Child support, you can't write off your kid, I'm not paying for my child.  All right, then he's dumb.  Well, he is, yeah.  Why would you get your wife pregnant knowing there's, you know.  Oh, he's letting that stuff fly.  What an idiot.  That golden fluid.  Unbelievable.  Like a rain cloud in his pants.  Let's get more audio out there to the peoples. 
[00:28:00]  Jeez.  Rodriguez's friendship with pop star Madonna reportedly the breaking point.  Rodriguez reportedly spotted leaving her Park Avenue apartment late at night.  After rumors about the state of her own marriage to director Guy Ritchie, Madonna saying in  a statement, I brought my kids to a Yankee game.  I am not romantically involved in any way with Alex Rodriguez.  I have nothing to do with the state of his marriage or what spiritual path he may choose  to study.  What the hell's going on here? 
[00:28:30]  So there's nothing.  She's completely denying it.  She's denying everything, even like the Kabbalah part.  Because she's got her own issues with her husband, Guy Ritchie.  So why are they leaving like, what is he leaving her apartment late at night?  And why is he banging a, allegedly banging a 50-year-old broad?  How old is A-Rod?  32?  34?  What?  What is he doing?  Maybe he's just up to that age now.  Like in his checklist. 
[00:29:00]  All right.  I banged everything from 17 up.  I'm up to 50s.  But there's so many like high profile celebrity women out there that are a hell of a lot younger.  Why would you want to be with Madonna?  We were talking about her ligaments yesterday.  Yeah.  Madonna's ligaments.  You know, I think a woman is bangable until you see the ligaments.  When there's too many ligaments going on.  And a hiney bone.  And a hiney bone.  You don't want that hiney bone, the pelvis, digging in. 
[00:29:30]  Right.  Ugh.  Hurts.  That's why you got the, you know, that little.  The indent?  Well, why don't we just play another clip?  Yankee third baseman Alex Rodriguez is one of baseball's highest paid players ever.  With an annual salary of $28 million.  He and his wife signed a prenuptial agreement one month before their 2002 wedding.  Cynthia Rodriguez is asking for alimony, child support for their two young children, life as well as health insurance, 
[00:30:00]  private school for their children, and for their two daughters to maintain their current lifestyle.  A lavish lifestyle that includes a $7 million condo on the fourth floor of this posh building on Park Avenue,  and this Coral Gables, Florida sprawling $12 million six-bedroom estate.  So she gets it anyway.  Even though there's a prenup, this bitch gets it anyway because of the kids.  Because the kids need to live in a house like that. 
[00:30:30]  And what's she going to do?  I'd say, okay, put the kids up in the house with a nanny, and you get yourself a goddamn apartment somewhere.  There should be a stipulation.  She gets all that, but she has to face like a major league pitcher.  Throw the high heat.  Right.  Make her retarded.  That's what the stipulation should be.  If you can hit a 100-mile-an-hour fastball, you get the following.  You get the house in Coral Gables. 
[00:31:00]  You get the alimony.  That would be a great thing to do.  Right.  Like, go ahead.  All right.  The wife has to come in and, let's say, put on an entertaining radio show for a while.  Whoa!  I'm just picking a career out of my hat here.  Whoa!  What if they have to come in and put on an entertaining show, talk to the people out there for a while?  I'm just saying, maybe we should have an open mind, because, you know, A-Rod's making all the money because of the skills he has.  Uh-huh.  And now she turns around and gets probably close to half of what he has. 
[00:31:30]  She should be able to hit a 100-mile-an-hour fastball.  Exactly.  I don't completely fault her.  I fault him on this one.  He's a dummy.  Look, he's stupid.  He got busted with a stripper.  Mm-hmm.  Photos in the paper.  He embarrassed his wife badly.  What does he...  Mm-hmm.  You can't do it.  It's like, what are you doing?  Stop it, you moron.  You're going to get killed in court.  Yeah.  You can't defend against that.  Public infidelity?  I had pictures with a stripper and... 
[00:32:00]  You can't.  Well, here's a little tidbit of information.  In Florida, where they are married, infidelity does not come into play, as far as a settlement  goes, in court.  Face!  It doesn't even matter.  And they can't take your home in Florida.  They can't?  No, no.  They can't for...  I'm saying even if you go home.  For anything?  Even if you go home.  You don't pay your mortgage?  Oh.  Oh.  Really?  Yeah, it's a homestead state.  Really?  I was joking.  Florida's a no-fault divorce. 
[00:32:30]  Opie, it badly.  Hold on, Opie.  God had the answer.  God.  Isn't that why Opie moved to Florida to protect his estate so they can't take it?  Because it's one of those homestead states like Texas.  Homestead?  We hear this.  You're protected so that you won't be forced out of your home, but you will have to eventually  pay back your debts.  So why would anyone pay their mortgage?  Well, it's about your credit rating, too.  You won't be able to get any future money.  He needs credit rating if you've got your house, and they can't take it. 
[00:33:00]  Forget it.  He's just a dummy.  I mean, he's in the first year of a 10-year, $275 million contract.  Why didn't he get rid of the wife before he signed the new deal?  Why did he get her pregnant again?  What is wrong with this guy?  Why is he banging, allegedly, a 50-year-old broad with ligaments?  He's damaged, this guy.  He was, I guess he was trying to keep up, you know, the good face.  Florida's a no-fault divorce date, 50-50 split, yes. 
[00:33:30]  Okay.  God.  What's that mean?  Anytime you get divorced, it's 50-50?  What lazy courts?  Stupid-ass New York can suck it.  God, I hate New York's divorce laws.  Why?  Ugh.  Why?  Because, uh...  Where have you been the last eight years?  Jesus.  No, no, no, but I mean, what's the difference between that and Florida?  Like, 50-50, you know?  Four more.  Four more easy payments.  It's on the payment plan.  Four to go.  For my car.  And then a huge party will be had.  You promised a huge party. 
[00:34:00]  Remember that.  Oh.  A huge party.  That's right.  Boy, what's it?  If Florida makes you half to each person.  Yeah.  It's a lot.  Mm-hmm.  Of what you have.  That would have been fine.  Oh.  Half of what I got, I ain't got crap.  Didn't own anything.  No kids.  No house.  Nothing.  You didn't even have clothes.  Right. 
[00:34:30]  Seriously.  I had booze t-shirts from all of our gigs.  I had swag.  That's what I wore.  And you had a...  Station swag.  And you had a computer that is very outdated by now.  Oh, yeah.  By now, that computer would be just ridiculous.  It's gone.  You had nothing.  Nothing.  I'd have gladly split nothing.  Imagine if it was a 50-50.  Yeah, but they'd go with that future earnings crap.  Yeah.  See?  Allegedly.  That's what they do in New York. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  So that's the latest we got on A-Rod.  And as she takes the high road, she spent 100 Gs in Paris yesterday, according to the newspaper  this morning.  She flew a bunch of people over to first class.  Did she really?  Yeah, like her and that bodybuilder guy, her kids and her godparents.  I mean, airfare alone is probably...  What do you think first class on a real international airline is?  Not continental.  Like $250.  No, it's got to be more. 
[00:35:30]  That's a guy who doesn't get humor at all.  How could it be that cheap, Opie?  Oh, it's a guy that doesn't get any humor at all.  That's a guy who never gets sarcasm or any type of humor at all.  He's just a blunt idiot.  Yeah.  So, ah.  And then you got the Christy Brinkley story.  That's a good one, too.  Now, that one's full of some fun.  That's just not this infidelity with a stripper kind of easy stuff like that.  No.  This guy was a real creep. 
[00:36:00]  He loved the internet.  Oh, my God.  Did he love not being able to do things with two hands in front of his computer?  Let's all be honest here.  As men.  Men.  We like the internet.  But this guy loved it.  Oh, my God.  He could not get enough.  He was spending upwards of $3,000 a month on certain porn sites on the internet.  Wait, what did he get for that money? 
[00:36:30]  We're talking about Peter Cook, obviously, who was married to Christy Brinkley.  He was going on certain sites where he was able to take care of himself on camera.  He was on camera doing this.  And I gather watching somebody else on camera.  Why don't you get PalTalk for free?  Exactly.  Why wouldn't you just get PalTalk?  I don't get it.  Up to $3,000 a month?  Yeah, a month.  Getting off with the internet?  Yep.  And some of these, what, live cam rooms?  Yep.  That's what he's doing. 
[00:37:00]  Hooking up with a girl.  You know, I guess it was more of these private, you know, porno site rooms where you can log on to some sexy girl.  And she does things that you tell her to do.  What does it say about the Uptown Girl?  That she's not very proficient.  Sounds like the Uptown Girl doesn't go downtown.  Oh, no, you didn't.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:37:30]  Boo!  It's always one.  Yeah.  Yeah, Christy Brinkley wasn't getting the job done for this Peter Cook guy.  That's what I get from this whole case.  No.  If he's just...  And they're trying to use it against him, saying that, you know, he's got kids and the wife.  And instead of being with them, he would, you know, go to this computer and just sit there for hours.  Making a wreck of the joint, I guess. 
[00:38:00]  Wasn't he trying to hook up threesomes and he was going to swinger sites and all that, right?  Yeah.  Imagine being Christy Brinkley and you carry a lot of clout when you bring that to the threesome.  There you go.  What do you got for me?  I got this.  Right.  What are you bringing?  Take me to the special room.  Yeah.  I want this fatty.  Who's your partner?  Well, you got a radio, a little song you might recognize.  Whoa!  Yeah, that one.  Yeah, that's her.  Yeah.  There you go.  Just play this as you walk in.  Yeah. 
[00:38:30]  All right.  What's in it for me, guys?  What did you bring?  Marriage number four.  Who else is your marriage?  Billy Joel?  Billy Joel.  I don't know.  You're up.  Some helicopter skier dude.  Yeah, the guy that jumped out of a helicopter and skied.  I don't know.  Or the helicopter crashed.  What was the story with that guy?  Here's what the news is saying about Christy Brinkley today.  This is our divorce segment.  Yeah.  Christy Brinkley testifying how involved she is in the daily lives of her children, 10-year-old 
[00:39:00]  sailor and 13-year-old Jack.  Christy, you seem to light up when you talk about your children.  They named the kid Jack.  I bet that was his choice.  Oh.  What's the sign?  Sailor?  Sailor or really?  Sailor.  Full disclosure, don't make fun of that name.  No, the middle name is not Mehoff.  That's silly, Bill from Waterford. 
[00:39:30]  Sailor Mehoff?  Bill from Munaki.  Yeah.  Can't be Mehoff.  Their son is named Jack.  I didn't even notice that until right now.  Very good, Anthony.  Very good.  Light up when you talk about your children.  How important are they to you?  They're my world.  Brinkley testifying that in the years leading up to what she calls the betrayal, referring  to Cook's affair with then-teenager Diana Bianchi, that Cook became less involved with the children  and wouldn't even have dinner with them, instead insisting on dining and drinking wine by himself  in a separate part of their sprawling Bridgehampton estate. 
[00:40:00]  In front of a computer.  Yep.  Separate part.  The sprawling estate.  He's in a closet with a computer.  Don't come in here.  Another guy with the perv switch.  Oh, he couldn't take it.  His family, his kids.  Just logging onto that computer.  Oh, I gotta get home.  Gotta get to that computer.  I'll take dinner in the West Wing again.  Yeah.  Well, you and the kids can eat out here.  I'll just get a sandwich and go into this room.  Yeah.  Somebody out there is calling her the uptight girl. 
[00:40:30]  He's got a plate of buffalo wings.  He's typing lefty.  Yeah.  Getting smooch marks all over the keyboard.  I love him.  Creep.  Oh, total ghoul.  And then this.  Brinkley appearing poised and confident on the stand, not missing any opportunities to  cut down Cook, who is the biological father of Sailor and the adoptive father of Jack,  and call into question his parenting skills.  On the stand, Brinkley said she questions Cook's judgment, saying,  How could anyone run the risk of ruining this wonderful life? 
[00:41:00]  Anyone who can chase a teenage girl?  Anyone who would run out of the house when he has beautiful children at home to masturbate  on the World Wide Web?  She shook her head and said,  It makes you wonder, where is his judgment?  Do we have to call it the World Wide Web?  The World Wide Web.  Wow.  He went to HTTP dot dot colon slash slash www.  The World Wide Web.  Anybody who would sign on via C-Prompt. 
[00:41:30]  He was going to BBS's.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, and what about her?  Just stop.  Give up this wonderful life.  It's the reason.  There's kids running around.  One isn't even his.  There's Christy Brinkley's, you know.  I don't know.  Well, if you ask me, my opinion, dead fish. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  The hell.  She's been through a few husbands.  And, you know, maybe the guy needs a little pick-me-up.  And where does old googly eyes stand on this thing?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Also known as Christy and Billy Joel's daughter.  Old googly eyes.  Alexa?  Is she standing by her mommy?  Old googly eyes.  Alexa.  I don't think she's involved in this in any way, right? 
[00:42:30]  How do you come out that ugly if you have a mom like Christy Brinkley?  Yeah.  How does that happen?  You'd think her jeans would have, like, overrode Billy's jeans.  The Billy Joel jeans?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Old googly eyes.  Googly eyes.  I think she has a problem sleeping at night.  She can't get those eyelids shut.  That is just, like, awful of her, though. 
[00:43:00]  Wow.  She looks good there, though.  Look at that.  She grew up.  The first picture of Alexis I've seen where she doesn't look that bad.  Maybe she was tired.  Her eyes are half shut because she's sleepy.  Maybe that's it.  She's got to be tired all the time, so her eyes look almost normal.  Wow.  Those are some big eyes.  All right.  We'll take another break here.  877-212-ON-A.  That's what we got on our divorce segment.  You want to add anything here, Ant?  No. 
[00:43:30]  People have heard it before.  It's hard for me to side with the gals on anything.  I don't care if the guy's just banging five girls in his bed and she walks in with three  of the kids.  It's hard for me to side with them.  You think she thought she was so hot and so supermodel-ish that she didn't have to do  certain things and that's where Peter Cook decided, whoa, I got my needs.  I don't know.  Either that or this guy's just one of these, you know. 
[00:44:00]  Creeps.  Like Jimmy.  He just needs to be in front of a computer.  It's so hard not to.  Yeah, but he's going to.  It's right there in your house.  He's going to have some things to say eventually, right?  He hasn't hit the stand yet, has he there, Stunt?  Yeah.  He has?  Yeah, he has.  What is he claiming?  He had to admit to all this.  He was crying on the stand talking about the whole affair and what happened with it.  It was real funny.  And then I would log on and I would start to...  And then I had to have sex with a really hot teenager. 
[00:44:30]  I'm so sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  That trellis spit when his mouth opens between the left and the right hand.  Yeah.  Oh, crying while you're admitting to just taking care of yourself.  The bartery on the internet.  $3,000 I could have into the children's college fund when I spent it on the internet for an 
[00:45:00]  I could be.  No.  Stop it.  No, on the World Wide Web.  The World Wide Web.  The inner tubes.  Just suck it up.  I got to be honest.  Say, yeah, that's what I did.  I had to.  She was terrible.  This Alexa Ray Joel thing is now confusing me because now Iraq has shown me two...  ...maybe three pictures where she looks hot as hell. 
[00:45:30]  Well, when was the last time you saw her?  She was a little kid, right?  Yeah, but then there's other pictures and she's got the old googly eyes.  Who's the real Alexa Ray?  Some of these model shots, if you Google image her, they're pretty good, man.  Yeah, they cleaned her up.  Huh?  They cleaned her up real nice.  You know?  Tell Iraq if he doesn't open another picture, I'm going to bite his ears off.  Iraq?  Iraq?  I'm going to open another picture.  He's going to bite your ears off. 
[00:46:00]  Thanks, sir.  Iraq, what do you think of the A-Rod thing?  Microphone, Iraq.  I think he's a scum.  Oh, God.  That's wonderful.  Oh, he was ready to curse.  Yeah.  Even though it's not a real curse.  All right, why don't you take us a break with that thing you were going to play.  What is this?  Anthony's what?  Wedding planner thing?  All right, check this out.  It's opiate, Anthony.  You're getting married.  No, no.  Here's Anthony from the Oakley & Anthony show to help you plan the perfect wedding. 
[00:46:30]  I'm talking to you.  Are you listening?  First, you must carefully choose a wedding ring for your gal.  I went into one of those jewelry stores in Penn Station, and I think I spent, um, 300 bucks on it.  Uh, right.  Well, you should also make sure your betrothed gets along with your dear, sweet mother.  Your son is a scumbag.  Uh, maybe not.  Your wedding night, on the other hand, should be a magical one. 
[00:47:00]  I believe, uh, I laid there looking at the ceiling with tears of regret and sorrow rolling down the sides of my face.  Just follow these simple steps, and you'll have the perfect wedding.  Just like, and, eh, I got nothing.  I was shocked.  I was horrified.  I was broke.  Hopeless.  What did I get myself into?  It only took nine and a half years for me to leave.  Never marry a wife! 
[00:47:30]  I was a broken, beaten man, and I had been married for six hours.  Wow, this is, this is radio in its most fascinating.  Cutting-edge radio, I don't know how to do this.  Opie and Anthony.  Bang, bang!  Bang, bang!  Bang, bang! 
[00:48:00]  Bang, bang!  Opie and Anthony.  So what do we know about the, uh, Obama plane thing?  Well, apparently, uh, Obama's, uh, flying commercial.  I don't know what the hell, no, he had a charter plane.  Yeah.  And it was one of these, uh, MD-80s.  McDonnell Douglas, uh, MD-80.  They're, they're probably the worst planes out there.  Why are they the worst planes out there?  They're very old. 
[00:48:30]  They've been around for a long, long time.  The, um, Douglas Corporation used to put them out under the DC-10 and DC-9, uh, uh, numbers.  And that goes back to, what, the 60s?  It's just, they're ancient planes.  And then when, uh, McDonnell Douglas picked them up, they changed the name to the MD-80.  They, you know, upgraded some of the stuff.  But there's still old frames and old planes, old designs. 
[00:49:00]  How, how do you know so much about this?  Oh, I love aviation.  I, um, I watch a lot on Discovery.  Forget Aristotle and Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  What happened?  Why was there static?  I don't know.  It happens every time.  Thank God.  Because it saves us from a huge fine.  Um, uh, I didn't know you knew so much about the MD-80s.  Yes.  The MD-80.  I, I know a lot about them because I try to steer clear of them when I'm booking airline 
[00:49:30]  reservations anywhere.  Do you know, to go to Bonnaroo, I wouldn't even take American Airlines because they had  MD-80s going to Tennessee.  It's like, I'm sure you can get there, but they freaked me out too.  That's, I flew one to Tennessee, uh, and I flew, uh, 7, uh, 37 back.  But going there, I'm on MD-80 just going, eh, well, how often do they?  So basically the MD-80s, we give these things to other countries and they end up going down  in the mountains somewhere.  Yeah, well, American Airlines seems to use a lot of them. 
[00:50:00]  So, you know.  Why is Obama flying one of these?  I don't know.  It's charter plane.  If little Jimmy Norton wouldn't fly one of these, why is Obama flying?  Why would Obama?  Because he's probably not making the decisions on the aircraft and he's probably not a flying  obsessed idiot like I am.  So he's probably not going, what kind of plane is it?  You know, I would demand a 737 or something new.  Yeah.  So they're calling it a close call and they're saying this was pretty serious.  Well, no, no.  Actually, they're trying to just downplay it and say, no, this was nothing.  Nothing to worry about.  Don't worry about it.  But it turns out the rear slide, the emergency slide, that's tucked into the rear cone at 
[00:50:30]  the tail of the plane deployed.  The cone didn't pop off, but it deployed and affected the pitch trim of the plane.  So the plane couldn't stabilize the nose from going up or down.  So they really couldn't just fly level without, you know, the pilot's input. 
[00:51:00]  Could that?  Let me ask you.  Wait, did the plane pink sock?  Did the plane pink sock?  That's a great way to put it.  Well, you know something?  Because I'm looking at the TV and they showed kind of a graphic.  Yeah.  And it's just like, it's like this slide and it looks like it pink socked.  It pink socked his plane.  God pink socked the plane.  But nothing came out of the plane?  No, no.  It didn't come out of the plane. 
[00:51:30]  All right.  It deployed inside the cone and threw off the pitch.  Wait, what would happen if it, would it have crashed?  They say D.B. Cooper when he jumped.  The way those old planes would work is the back of the plane would open.  Yeah, there's a stairway in the back.  So technically the cabin pressure would have gone out because he would have jumped out the back.  Yeah, you could, there have been planes that have flown with that rear stairwell open.  You just can't go that high up, you know.  If you're above, I don't know, 5,000, 6,000, 7,000 feet, it starts getting a little iffy. 
[00:52:00]  What if his plane have crashed if that had popped, if the cone had popped off?  They're saying like this is a lot more serious than his people are saying.  Yeah, there's a good chance there's a lot of, in that kind of plane, a lot of hydraulic lines and cables that are back there for all the control surfaces on the rear of the plane.  And just drag alone, you know, you don't know what else it's going to rip out if it did deploy the whole way and the cone came off. 
[00:52:30]  So they're saying, eh, pretty serious.  Wow.  So Obama's, but they, I guess they fixed it.  And what, he took back off again in the same plane?  No.  Did they give him a new plane?  All right, he can't be president.  He's dumb.  He's too stupid?  No one would do that.  You shouldn't go on a plane like that.  No one would do that.  He really did that?  No, I don't know. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, okay.  Speaking of Obama, Danny just ran in some great audio.  Texas Senator Kirk Watson, did you guys see this?  I did not.  Uh-oh.  A Texas senator?  Gee, did he say something that could be interpreted as racist?  He's a supporter of Obama.  Doesn't seem to matter.  Kirk Watson, the Texas senator, was confronted by Chris Matthews on what Obama has done.  Oh, boy.  With his political career.  Okay.  And this is the audio. 
[00:53:30]  It's good.  You're a big Barack supporter, right, Senator?  I am.  Yes, I am.  Well, name some of his legislative accomplishments.  No, Senator, I want you to name some of Barack Obama's legislative accomplishments.  Oh, does he go after him?  Well, you know, what I will talk about is more about what he's offering to the American people.  No, no, what does he accomplish, sir?  You say you support him.  Sir, you have to give me his accomplishments.  You've supported him for president.  You're on national television.  Name his legislative accomplishments, Barack Obama, sir. 
[00:54:00]  Well, I'm not going to be able to name you specific items of legislative accomplishments.  Can you name anything he's accomplished as a congressman?  No, I'm not going to be able to do that tonight.  Well, that's a problem, isn't it?  Well, no, I don't think it is.  Because I think one of the things that Senator Obama does...  Pat did a better job on the show yesterday.  He's able to lay out a vision.  Chris, am I able to say anything?  He's able to lay out solutions.  But, Senator, I'm going to give you one more shot.  But, list Barack Obama's accomplishments as a U.S. senator now. 
[00:54:30]  Well, what I'll do is I will say this to you.  He will offer the ability of the United States...  The best part is the guys laughing in the background.  This is a perfect example of what's going on in this country.  That is one of the most reasonable questions I've ever heard somebody ask.  List his accomplishments.  And that way, it gives you a little background on the guy. 
[00:55:00]  What he's all about.  What his platform is.  Where he stands on certain issues that are important.  This guy knew nothing.  Is Chris Matthews...  I mean, this might be very ignorant.  He's typically really conservative, right?  Or no?  Oh, he's not.  I think he's more...  Is he more liberal or is he liberal?  I think he's more liberal, no?  He's a big Hillary supporter.  And I actually believe this was mid-campaign.  Or late in the campaign this happened.  But yeah, he's been a huge Hillary supporter.  Oh, this wasn't recently?  I don't think this was that recent. 
[00:55:30]  I think this happened just as they were on the verge of deciding.  Well, you think that guy just kind of went and studied every single thing Obama voted on?  Yeah.  After that interview?  Now he's like Gleason getting pulled off the set of the quiz show.  Yeah.  This legislation, 1997?  Hey, look.  A little bill called?  I, uh...  He can't be honest and admit, like... 
[00:56:00]  Because I kind of want Obama because I think McCain is too old.  He can't really just come out and say that.  And I kind of want a black president.  I really do.  And there's something about him I like.  I don't know exactly what it is.  It's so racist to say that.  No, it's not.  It's just...  I kind of want a black president.  I do.  I think it's a...  Just to see it?  It makes sense.  It's like a gag.  It's like...  It's like you're kind of putting it into this gag category by just saying, ah, I just want  a black president.  No, but...  See what happens.  No, saying I kind of want a black president means it's like a factor which will override 
[00:56:30]  me not knowing a lot about him.  If I knew really negative things about him, that'd be different.  Yeah.  But I'm admitting I don't know too much about him other than the fact that there's something  about him that kind of makes people feel good, which might sound like a tremendously  shallow, idiotic thing, but look at the mess we're in now.  So it's like, so what?  I want to see it.  It can't hurt as far as...  Look, I just want to see it.  I want it.  And if he sucks, so we get rid of him in four years.  Big deal.  He's not going to be worse than Jimmy Carter.  He's not going to be worse than where we are now paying for something for gas. 
[00:57:00]  Well, I know, but I don't see his solutions for the gas problem.  The gas problem right now, to me, is a huge issue in this country right now.  How the hell the world allowed these criminals in the Middle East to hold us hostage and boost  the price of oil more than double it in a year is beyond me. 
[00:57:30]  How did that happen?  How did the world allow these criminals in the Middle East to do that?  But they did, and now we're paying more for gas than we ever have ever imagined we would  pay in such a short period of time.  And Obama has nothing for this.  At least McCain is saying, yeah, you know something?  We've reached a point where we've got to drill.  We've got to drill.  We've got to do more research and come up with our own effing oil. 
[00:58:00]  I don't think he said the F word, though.  I think Obama's much more for alternative energy.  Alternative energy is not.  We can't just whip up this method of driving our cars around and turning on power plants  with this alternative energy.  Wait, you've got 100 years?  No, but we have to move towards it.  And a guy who's younger will look forward to that, whereas a guy who's 71 looks for  a fix immediately.  And the problem is, everyone's looking for a fix immediately, and this is where we are. 
[00:58:30]  And it's like, if we don't move beyond it, we're going to be slaves to these animals.  And I'm sick of watching American presidents hold hands with other men in their garden.  I'm tired of it.  I am right with you on that one.  So I'm willing to take the hit.  It's happening.  So we might as well take the hit and work towards this other source, because this way  we won't have to be dependent on these people.  I'm tired of them.  I think we have to do both, though.  I think we have to drill the crap out of Alaska, for God's sake. 
[00:59:00]  No!  Who cares about that frozen state?  No.  Who cares?  Take an Alaskan cruise.  Offshore oil drilling.  But take an Alaskan cruise.  You'll feel differently.  It's pristine.  It's beautiful up there.  Dude, slalom through the friggin' derricks.  I could care less.  I just want cheap fuel.  But what about the whales?  Whales?  There's whales up there.  I could care less. 
[00:59:30]  By the way...  If birds are covered with tar on every beach.  Anthony...  I want cheap oil.  Jimmy can help us out with what we were talking about in the office.  Who did the bit?  And we're thinking it might have been on this show.  You might have brought it to the show.  We're not sure.  But the whole oil thing, when oil was like a dollar a barrel.  Exaggeration, obviously.  We were spilling it all over the damn place.  But then it went up to this ridiculous price.  You don't hear one oil spill anymore.  Who did the bit? 
[01:00:00]  Anthony heard the bit.  I did the bit.  I heard the bit.  Oh, was that...  It's hilarious.  It's a great bit.  Was it DL?  Maybe it was DL when he was on the show?  I think it might have been.  Okay.  Yeah, when the price of oil was low, we were spilling it all over the place, destroying  animals and...  I mean, when the price of oil went up to like $70 a barrel, people were like, oh my god,  how the hell did we let it get that high?  And now it's 130, it hovers around at 120 something. 
[01:00:30]  And like a bunch of little bitches, we ran over to the Middle East, and we didn't care  about Kuwait, I think that we kicked Iraq out of Kuwait because we knew Saudi Arabia  was probably going to go next because I said, I'm hate of this.  We protected them, and this is what they give us back.  And they say, no, we're not increasing production.  We're not going to do this.  They're making a fortune off of us, and we've done nothing.  I almost hope that we stop being so dependent on them, and then the radicals just completely 
[01:01:00]  overrun the House of Sod and overthrow all of them, and they're all just kicked out.  I hope that we stop depending on them.  Oh, it would be amazing to see, because that's all they have.  They're crappy little country, little countries.  They have oil and nothing else.  And that's why they live like they live, in gold palaces.  And if we were ever lucky enough to come up with an alternative source domestically, I would 
[01:01:30]  love to watch the revolution and just the crumbling of these empires over there.  What else do we depend on them for?  Nothing.  Dirt.  Mer.  Stinky feet.  Mer.  They have nothing for us but that.  No.  Nothing for us but that.  So we stop depending on them.  Let them murder each other.  Expensive rugs. 
[01:02:00]  Exactly.  A tapestry, perhaps?  Tapestry.  We missed something very important.  Oh, no.  Brilliant.  Brilliant stuff going on this break.  But we've got to go way back.  Stunt brain was horribly wrong.  Oh, no.  Chris Matthews is a huge, huge Obama supporter.  Really?  And hates Clinton.  According to many, many, many, many, many feedbackers.  Really?  Yes.  Well, I do know this happened February 20th. 
[01:02:30]  So if he was in the midst of this battle and he knew this guy, he must have known this guy  had nothing.  Why did he set him up and press him like that?  That's a good question.  And I'd like an answer.  Matthews does not go into things naked or dumb.  So, stunt brain, you're holding strong here.  I'm saying I believe Chris Matthews is in the Hillary camp.  That's holding, but not quite as strong.  No.  Yeah.  He's still holding on.  Are you humming on humming in?  Nope.  Is there a little humming on humming going on?  Humming on humming on humming?  He's holding on, but he just wipes his hands on his pants to get the sweat off. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, he's getting a little nervous.  Yeah, I got a little humidity.  I mean, if you walk around with a cocky name like Stunt Brain, you can't be wrong ever.  Well, I got to go do something else.  That's why my name's Opie.  I can be a dope all the time.  No one's going to question it.  Good point.  But when you're Stunt Brain, they are going to call you out.  You can't mispronounce anything.  You're going to have your facts correct every single time.  Well, I got to go double check.  But look at it.  February 20th, in the midst of the battle, he cornered that guy. 
[01:03:30]  That's brilliant.  I loved it.  That's brilliant on Chris Matthews' part, because no one knows what these guys stand  for.  And I mean no one.  I'd like to know how he knew that this guy knew nothing about this.  Because I bet you you could get almost any senator on, and they would have the same reaction.  Yeah.  We did our own survey with potential voters on the streets of New York, and they don't  know why they're voting for McCain or Hillary, you know, back when Hillary was still in it,  or Obama.  No one knows what these people really stand for.  Yeah. 
[01:04:00]  That is the truth.  All right.  We're going to take a break with some primetime gossip, just in case you missed the latest.  Ooh.  Primetime gossip from young Sam Roberts.  Yeah, these are great.  Jimmy?  Breathing?  Heavy?  I was.  You all right?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm going to a doctor Monday for my sinuses.  Oh, are you?  Yeah, I'm getting a...  Consultation?  Are you actually going to get a...  I can't get it fixed yet.  I've got a consultation.  I have not been to anybody, but I can't live like this.  I'm going to put your head in a drill press and just ream out your nostrils. 
[01:04:30]  Nuts.  Matt from DC says, Jim doesn't vote, so shut up.  Oh.  Oh, whoa.  One of these guys.  Yeah, you're right, Matt.  I don't.  But I still have an opinion.  So what do you think of that?  Us non-voters showed him.  Yeah.  I don't vote.  You're right.  Like, Carlin, genius that he was, said people always say that you don't have the right to  comment if you don't vote.  He goes, no, that's exactly why I have the right to comment, because I didn't contribute  to this mess. 
[01:05:00]  Brilliant.  Brilliant point.  So there you go, you DC voter.  Yeah.  You dumb voter.  Us non-voters are making a statement by not voting.  That's right.  We're lazy.  I'll vote if I really feel like there's a guy worth voting for.  These two clowns?  Who are you kidding?  I voted for Perot.  I want Obama over McCain, but in the end, I don't give a crap who's president.  I really don't.  I really don't care.  It makes a difference on some level.  I mean, like, I don't think, honestly, Gore, as much as I didn't like him, I don't think 
[01:05:30]  we'd be in the situation we're in, at least in the middle of a war if he was there.  No.  But then again, you know, we might be in a worse situation as far as terrorism goes.  Right.  Who knows?  We'd all be speaking Arabic.  Right.  They would have won.  Yeah, there would be mosques all over the place and all that.  Give me Vince McMahon as a choice.  Yeah.  I'll get out there.  President Vince.  I'll get out to that grammar school and pull the lever for the local church basement.  I'll be there.  Well, he's very injured. 
[01:06:00]  I hope we have an update.  Well, we do have an update.  We can do that after the break, yes.  God.  The great Vince McMahon.  We got to find out what's going on with him.  Very injured.  I wouldn't vote for him for president because I don't know if he's qualified.  It would be fun to watch, though.  Certainly would.  Going to Congress and just hit people with chairs.  Throw sand in their eyes.  Right.  Just pulling all those shenanigans like in wrestling with like serious Congress.  Oh, would that be funny? 
[01:06:30]  Just being a complete ass.  Cage matches.  Yeah, to get laws passed.  Between senators.  Oh, great.  A law passing match.  Right.  Democrats versus Republicans in the steel cage.  That's right.  That's what you're going to get in a Royal Rumble.  Royal Rumble.  Royal Rumble.  Right here at the Capitol.  Oh, that would be fantastic. 
[01:07:00]  President Vince McMahon.  Hit Senator Kennedy over the head with a chair.  Oh.  Like he doesn't have enough problems with his brain.  Fake reporters at the press conference.  Yeah.  Hit him and you can tell it's just a breakaway podium and he falls down and makes that face.  Fake assassination attempts every week. 
[01:07:30]  But how great would that be?  Who wouldn't want to see that?  Fantastic.  Sure.  All right.  Here we go.  My vice president, Mick Foley.  Stone Cold Steve Austin.  He would be, I think, Secretary of Defense.  You think?  Open a can of whoop-ass on other countries.  That's all he'd have to talk about.  What about The Undertaker?  Oh, wow.  That's a tough one.  Yeah.  Secretary of State. 
[01:08:00]  He'd have to go and negotiate with other countries.  He'd just see, I'm putting foreign dignitaries in sleeper holes and just knocking them out.  Until they lower the price of oil.  Right.  Oh, you're going to lower the price of oil.  You're going to lower the price of oil.  You're going to lower it.  That's right.  You're hearing?  Or I'm sending over The Undertaker.  Triple H is going to the Middle East. 
[01:08:30]  And you better lower the oil prices.  That's right.  And he's taking Stone Cold Steve on.  You want the Stone Cold Stunner?  Oh, boy.  Hold on a minute.  Yeah?  I know we have to break.  Sam just walked in.  Oh, boy.  Sam.  Primetime Sam Roberts.  Excited.  Primetime Sam Roberts.  Now you're using his wrestling name.  Well, he brought this in. 
[01:09:00]  I think the Hillary appeal has always been somewhat about her tough, her mix of toughness and sympathy for her.  Let's not forget, and I'll be brutal, the reason she's a U.S. senator, the reason she's a candidate for president,  the reason she may be a frontrunner is her husband messed around.  That's how she got to be senator from New York.  We keep forgetting it.  She didn't win there on her marriage.  She won because everybody felt, my God, this woman stood up under humiliation.  And, right, that's what happened.  So it doesn't look like he really likes her.  That's not a written endorsement. 
[01:09:30]  Well.  Stunt brain comment.  I stand corrected, and I will tell you this.  There's even more.  But I still wonder why he set that guy up.  But he's also wrong about that's the only reason she got to like this senator because she stood up under humiliation.  It's kind of simplifying it.  It's stupid.  Yeah.  She was the head of the bar in Arkansas, wasn't she?  Or she did a lot of work for the bar in Arkansas and did a lot of work as the other one lawyer in the Rose Legal Park.  Why should we believe anything you say at this point?  Yeah, I know. 
[01:10:00]  That's a great point.  Can I get anybody tea or coffee during the break?  I'd like a little piece of humble pie.  If I write it wrong, guys.  Oh, Jimmy.  I'll be eating a little crow.  How about you?  Any more food references?  I can't.  Oh, good gravy.  Are we going to have a Vince McMahon update there, Sam?  I think it's time.  All right.  We'll do it after the break.  But first.  So they're all calling you a fraud now.  Yeah.  I'm just reading Stunt Brain fraud. 
[01:10:30]  Why?  Why can't Stunt Brain make a mistake?  One mistake, and he's a fraud.  I love that.  He-brained.  Stunt Brain.  And you might want to get an MRI.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  Something might be going on in that brain.  Old Stunt Pudding Brain.  That's right.  Old Stunt Brain, a.k.a. George Harrison.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  Why?  I don't know.  Why are you obsessed with poor George Harrison? 
[01:11:00]  Get him headphones with gutters on him.  That gutter joke killed me.  Poor guy.  That hat with gutters on him.  Blue Heeler Kentucky, until you prove yourself there, Stunt Brain, you're back to Coach Mike.  I'm sorry.  Coach Mike.  Coach Mike in the house.  Here's some gossip from Primetime Sam Roberts.  Coach.  We're back with more Primetime Gossip from Primetime Sam Roberts.  Anthelini celebrated their first 4th of July in a big way. 
[01:11:30]  The couple brought both families together and threw quite the soiree at the Kumia Mansion.  You know, the families came over and had some wine and beer for everybody.  During the party, the celebrity duo gathered up their friends and family to let them know they had a major announcement.  At this point, Jill's sister is crying.  Sal is going, I told you, Roe.  I told you.  I knew it.  I knew it.  My mother's face is just red.  Both families are just drop-jawed. 
[01:12:00]  But leave it to these two.  The couple ended it with a hilarious one-liner.  We saved a boatload of cash on our auto insurance with Geico.  I used a hacky Geico commercial line.  And you could not see two more pissed-off families in your life.  Oh, were they angry.  All car insurance jokes aside, while Anthelini may have told the families one thing,  our sources are saying that it was a blatant lie and that the couple will soon be married due to the fact that Jill is pregnant. 
[01:12:30]  In other news, Mandy Moore was seen with Jim Norton over the weekend in Las Vegas.  Could another celebrity couple be blossoming?  No!  Stay tuned as primetime gossip continues to keep you up to date on the information you need to know.  It's Tuesday.  New release day. 
[01:13:00]  Opie and Anthony, by the way.  What can you buy today?  Batman Begins.  The special edition.  Anthony's all about the special edition DVD, right?  I bought the same movie four or five times.  Why?  Because they put out special editions.  And I like extras on DVDs.  I like watching all the extras.  I watched every extra piece of footage they had on all the Lord of the Rings movies. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, really?  It took days.  But it was very interesting.  It was.  The models and how they did all the green screening.  No, I found that very interesting.  That's how I learned things.  It's, you know, you kind of learn how they made all the swords and the prosthetic devices to make all the ogres and the hobbit feet. 
[01:14:00]  D-Rock's writing, all the extra footage makes watching the movies 20 hours long.  Yeah, it does.  Oh, God.  Also, you could buy Stargate Atlantis season four today.  Never got into the whole Stargate thing. 
[01:14:30]  All right.  Sorry.  And then, as far as music goes, Beck has another fantastic album that he could purchase today.  Modern Guilt's getting great reviews.  There you go.  Yeah.  We were just talking about the price of Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Stupid gas prices.  And they're saying, obviously, it's going to get horrible for everybody when winter hits up here in the Northeast.  They were talking, because you get these panicky peats on Wall Street. 
[01:15:00]  Saying, oil could reach $200 a barrel, which would put gas prices somewhere around $6 a gallon.  Like, what?  Why would you say something like that, dummy?  Don't say it.  Yeah.  Speculator.  How are we going to heat our homes in the winter?  Yeah.  The winter is really going to be bad.  We'll just fill out one of those contracts with the oil company. 
[01:15:30]  Where it's like, here's your price.  You want to take it?  Now, you can gamble that the price is going to go up.  But if the price goes down, you've still got to pay this price.  For how long?  So, do you want to do it?  It seems like, for as long as the price stays the same.  Because then, when it goes up, for some reason, they have to come up with a new contract.  I don't know how they get away with that.  It's like, it's time to re-up your contract.  Okay, can I have the one I had last year?  No.  No, sorry.  The price of oil's gone up.  Yeah, but I was betting on that. 
[01:16:00]  See, my solution, everybody laughs at, but it's a legitimate solution.  Okay.  For the winter.  Giant house hats.  The whole neighborhood will look nice.  All the hats have giant fedoras on them.  The houses.  Yeah.  You said the hats have giant fedoras on them.  Did I?  Yes, you did.  Boo!  I should say, the jokes have giant fuses on them, because they're bombs.  Shame, shame, shame, shame. 
[01:16:30]  Maybe tell that joke in the heat from the explosion.  Yuck.  That was unfunny, even if I delivered it, like, perfectly.  Rickles in 68 couldn't have made that one funny.  House hat?  I don't know.  Seems nice.  Well, we got a guy that's getting around the old price of gas.  Oh, there's always somebody that figured it out.  Well, we got this guy.  One North Carolina man took a cross-country ride in his 1985 Mercedes on vegetable. 
[01:17:00]  Max.  Greg Melville replaced his car engine with a converter kit.  Melville received the used oil from restaurants.  He says it might seem strange, but it does save money.  It only took a year and a half to recoup the $2,000 he spent to buy and install that conversion  unit.  If we're a bunch of freaks, at least we're frugal freaks.  Okay.  I would say so.  Cars can run on the greasy fluid if they originally ran on diesel fuel. 
[01:17:30]  People are coming up with so many different ways.  Yeah, they're stealing that stuff now from restaurants.  It's amazing.  Hey, you know what?  We need to find an alternative, don't we?  Vegetable oil burglars.  Vegetable oil burglars.  That's a turd.  By the way, let it be known, that was Channel 11 News, the local news here in New York.  Well, then I must say.  The homo Anthony's girlfriend.  Very informative. 
[01:18:00]  Very informative, I must say.  They stink.  What?  Their improv skills stink.  I wouldn't say anything bad about them.  Vegetable oil burglars.  I've met them.  They were all very nice people.  And they try very hard over there.  They'd like to throw back a few, right?  I was, uh, right?  Who does an off hours?  And why don't you tell the story of horse sea?  What?  He's the meteorologist there.  Apparently he's a virgin. 
[01:18:30]  They call him horse.  And then the C word, you know, for a guy.  Horse cuckled.  Yes.  Why?  Is he, uh, is he?  I didn't ask.  Call him that or tripod.  They call him tripod?  Yeah.  Wow.  But he's a virgin.  What the hell's going on over there at Channel 11?  I don't know.  But, uh, he's the, you know, he's the meteorologist.  You know, he's the guy that, uh, figures everything out and then gives it over to Linda Church.  Oh.  So she doesn't even know what she's doing?  She just reads?  Didn't say that, I'm sure. 
[01:19:00]  Anthony Correa of the Opie and Anthony show is saying Linda Church is a fraud?  Is that what you just said?  I didn't say that.  I said Stunt Brain was a fraud.  Jimmy, you heard it right?  Linda Church is a fraud?  I didn't say that.  She, I'm sure, from interpreting a tripod's meteorological skills, you pick things up,  you learn things.  So I'm sure she's learned, uh...  So she doesn't even do her own maps?  No, she's there by the map.  She's doing her stuff.  She's just reading what Horsey has given her. 
[01:19:30]  Horsey does the heavy lifting and gets no credit.  Well, every station has the meteorologist.  Some of them are the weathermen.  Every station has a Horsey.  Horsey.  No, he's...  I don't know.  We watch it all the time.  Yeah.  The CW11 News.  For the comedy, for the humor.  They are entertaining, I'll say that.  See?  I gotta say, it is entertaining. 
[01:20:00]  There you go.  And it's like, there is a tabloid angle to it, but when you...  What's even more repulsive is when the real quote-unquote news is the tabloid angle they  throw at you.  You're like, what are you doing?  See?  I'm trying to be like the CW11.  Exactly.  That's what I said.  Ugly older women.  I went there.  I got pictures at the desk.  I don't like your smug guy picture.  I was actually jealous when I saw this dumb smug guy picture.  Yeah, I got a picture with smug guy.  Mwah.  Mwah.  Mwah.  Me and smug guy. 
[01:20:30]  Very entertaining.  Did you put that picture up on onaradio.com?  Did you get that one yet?  Of you...  I gotta send it over to you.  I'm sorry, Stunframe.  Smug guy?  Me and smug guy.  God, do they...  All together.  They stink at doing the news.  No!  Why don't they have you as a guest news guy one day?  No!  Do any of your impressions?  You only deliver like the really tragic stuff like fires.  I think that are totally inappropriate if you're doing it in a Vince voice.  But you do it anyway.  No.  You do it as Tom Brokaw.  It's a rape case.  I can't be funny doing this. 
[01:21:00]  You guys want to do our cute pet segment?  A pet segment?  We do cute pet segments every once in a while.  Yes.  See, we gotta play animal noises.  All right.  We have two cute pet stories.  I hold one in my right hand and one in my left hand.  Which one do you want?  Well, one is basically the jiggler...  Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.  Now which one do you want? 
[01:21:30]  I'm looking at your hands.  One jiggles, one tugs.  I would say...  I'm gonna go with the jiggle hand.  Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.  Now which one?  Still the jiggle hand.  Which is the jiggle hand?  Oh, come on now.  Ah, don't tell him and then he won't know where to put it.  A hand you jiggle with.  One tugs, one jiggles.  Right hand?  Hmm.  Let's see.  Trying to think.  Oh, that type of?  Oh, yeah, right hand.  Tug and a jiggle.  Yeah, definitely a right hand.  Really?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Which is weird because I hang to the left. 
[01:22:00]  So, like...  All right, here's our cute pet segment.  We start with this one.  Aw.  A family returns home from vacation to a horrifying sight.  Someone had killed their family dog, the Chihuahua.  Now we warn you, this story is disturbing.  The Medina's can't...  These bastards.  We warn you.  We warn you.  Story is disturbing.  This is not the news.  If a cop is shot, they wouldn't say... 
[01:22:30]  I mean, this is disturbing, but they wouldn't warn you like that if a cop was just gunned  down, or if a drunk driver just killed a family.  It's amazing how they selectively choose what's disturbing.  Mm-hmm.  I'm boring myself at this point.  Go on.  Warn you, this story is disturbing.  The Medina's can't think of why anyone would want to do this, other than the fact that they're  Hispanic.  My mother from Mexico and my family all here.  Umberto Medina proudly displays pictures of his beloved family. 
[01:23:00]  I'm real happy with what God gave me.  Missing on his wall are pictures of their dog, Taco, who was like family.  I always went outside.  He always lived with me, and when bring it in, he always be real friendly with my daughter.  The pictures of Taco are now buried with him.  Medina says they're too painful to look at because his last image is of Taco cut in half.  Ah!  Ah!  Wow.  Half a taco?  Ah! 
[01:23:30]  By the way, it's not cute to name a chihuahua Mexican thing names.  Why do people do that?  Oh, he's a chihuahua.  Let's name him Taco.  Burrito.  I don't know, but let's not stereotype that Hispanics.  Dirty Sanchez.  Hispanics have a dog named Taco.  That's a chihuahua.  I don't like stereotypes.  Let's not lump.  Jesus.  I heard the worst dog name ever.  I was reading The Road by the author that also did No Country for Old Men. 
[01:24:00]  And?  And this old Bronwyn, one of these like cigarette voices?  Yeah.  Was scolding her dog, Sexy.  Ah!  Worst name ever.  Sexy.  Sexy.  Don't do that.  Sexy.  What are you doing?  Worst dog name ever.  Dexter.  Yeah, good point.  Horrible name for a dog.  Horrible dog.  Horrible dog.  Horrible name.  Dexter.  I hear Dexter doesn't even go outside because what?  The humidity gets to his little nostrils that aren't wide enough to get a fish in air. 
[01:24:30]  Why would you get a dog that sounds like this?  Dog can't breathe.  Living with Voss.  Except smarter.  Yeah.  What were you going there, too?  Oh, sorry.  So there.  Of course.  Stupid Voss.  He's dumber than a dog.  You shouldn't buy a dog that has sleep apnea.  Yeah.  Club soda Dexter wakes up on a plane. 
[01:25:00]  Sexy, though.  Can you imagine?  Sexy.  So broad.  Sexy.  That's an awful name.  So the dog got cut in half.  It's a chihuahua.  Cut in half by what?  I'm guessing the dog was loud because they bark.  Oh, they do.  And it's probably driving somebody nuts.  Maybe there's a rat problem in that neighborhood and they just thought it was another rat.  These dumb tiny dogs.  Cut them in half, though, with what? 
[01:25:30]  It's true.  A razor blade.  They're so tiny.  Cutting remark.  I look through the main window on the back yard and I saw the brown spot right there in  two pieces.  It's terrible.  The guy looks in the back yard and he has to see a brown spot.  Maybe I'll bake a cake for her.  That totally sounds like him.  Pedro.  Pedro.  Two pieces. 
[01:26:00]  Medina made the gruesome discovery after returning home from vacation.  His son had been taking care of Taco, but when Medina called for him, nothing.  And I said, no, no, no, no.  It can't be true.  Last night, I barely sleep a little bit because I have the picture in my mind.  I know it's just a little dog, but I love him.  Medina, I believe he knows who did this, but he doesn't want to say who that might be.  Police say whoever did this is capable of hurting humans, possibly even becoming a serial 
[01:26:30]  killer.  All right.  Slow down.  With a dumb chihuahua.  Chihuahua.  What a dumb back sell that is to get the serial killer because serial killers typically torture  animals first.  We get it.  It doesn't necessarily mean if you cut a chihuahua in two that you're going to be a serial killer.  No.  Well.  I do hope they find who did that.  Yeah.  It is disgusting.  What kind of a creep does that to a little dog? 
[01:27:00]  We're in the middle of our cute pet segment on the show.  God damn dog dying.  Hi.  Have we played that in a while?  By the way, it would have been more disturbing if he called Taco and half of them showed up.  Yeah.  Where's the rest of you, little buddy?  Where is?  Indicates the yard.  Little Taco.  Cute pet segment.  One more before we go to break.  A downstate Illinois woman loses her big toe after her dog chews it off. 
[01:27:30]  56-year-old.  That's a good one.  Chews it off.  56-year-old Linda Floyd of Alton suffers from severe diabetes and has no feeling in her toes  because of nerve damage.  After waking up from a nap on Monday, she realized her right big toe was missing.  Oh.  While she was being treated at a local hospital, Floyd asked officials to euthanize her one-year-old dog,  Roscoe, for safety reasons for others.  A veterinarian says the bandage may have attracted the dog to her toe. 
[01:28:00]  A bandage?  So she's just sitting there with a bandaged toe and the dog comes over and eats it off  and she doesn't notice?  She's very observant.  Wow.  And then why do they have to put the dog down?  She obviously wasn't feeding it enough.  He's not a very supportive dog if you have an injury and he just eats the part off you.  He's not exactly a good pet.  She was training him with peanut butter when he got carried away and ate her foot off.  She said it could have been much worse. 
[01:28:30]  She fell asleep with her foot in the jar, Skippy.  Oops.  They found the poor dog whimpering with oven mitts taped to his front paws.  I love the oven mitts.  I know.  What an image.  Because the preparation.  Oh, I know.  How embarrassing.  You have to think, not only am I going to allow a dog to do this, but I could get injured.  Let me tape it.  And the dog is probably so confused.  Oh, you know the damage that little dewclaw can do? 
[01:29:00]  Digs in there.  Not when you're wearing oven mitts.  Come here.  Come here, Dexter.  My favorite pet stories are the pets that end up eating their owner.  Oh, after the owner dies?  Yeah, because everyone thinks pets aren't animals.  They're all animals.  And if you don't feed them, they're going to start eating.  Kisses.  Give me kisses.  Right.  Give me kisses.  Every once in a while you get a story and Old Broad dies.  Yeah.  All she had left was her poodle. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  They were like partners.  And the lady dies.  And, you know, the dog needs food.  And next thing you know, they find, like, the lady half-eaten.  Yeah.  And the poodle's still alive in the house.  Yep.  He's got to eat.  He doesn't think about, you know, oh, that was my owner.  She was so nice to me.  She fed me all the time.  It's just like, hey, look at this old piece of meat on the floor.  Tastes like grizzle, but I'm hungry.  I don't care.  Let me start here.  Just doing that whole, where they grab tight and then back off, sliding on the linoleum. 
[01:30:00]  And he's just ripping part of grandma off.  That is the reality.  That's the reality.  Your pets are animals.  Tears away and he just.  You don't believe me?  Starve your dog for the next three days.  Yeah.  And then walk in.  Walk out of the house and see what he attempts to do.  Walk in and then try to give him kisses.  Right.  Watch your nose disappear.  Yeah.  Old sexy is going to take a bite. 
[01:30:30]  Stupid sexy.  I hope sexy eats this old broad's ass.  I wish I could record this old cigarette voice lady talking about sexy.  Stupid dog.  He's been eyeing those breasts for eight years.  Like, he can't wait for you to grab your chest and hit the floor.  Or, he's already learned how to undo a bra.  Like, when you fall asleep, the dog's online learning how, with paws, you can undo a bra.  Yeah.  She claps.  She's still alive, but he's already in the back, unsnapping it, undoing her blouse. 
[01:31:00]  She's like, what are you doing?  That's fantastic.  Gwar?  I got Blue Heeler telling me that Gwar has a song about a little dog named Pookie that eats his old lady owner.  Hilarious.  Hmm.  I'm telling you, in the end, they're no animals.  Oh, it happens.  Yeah.  It happens.  What part do you think they go after first?  What do you think?  I'm thinking the cheek.  First?  The face?  You think they eat the face first?  Hell yeah.  It's the most familiar part, I guess. 
[01:31:30]  Hell yeah.  I guess it would depend on what you're wearing, how you fell down.  What's exposed?  Oh, yeah.  You got to think it's old.  I would think a nice, meaty part of the buttock.  I'm thinking it's an old lady with a house dress, so maybe a calf.  Yeah, a calf.  Oh.  And it just comes apart right at the knee, and he just goes off in the corner with the leg.  Like, it was just a bone that she gave him.  Right.  Like, he's not even thinking.  It's not like he's looking, like, doing that sad dog look up thing, like, oh, I'm just hungry. 
[01:32:00]  I got to do this.  The dog's just crunching away on bone marrow.  He don't know.  It's an animal.  Kisses.  Give mommy kisses.  Yeah.  It goes to your face.  Let's say hi to Dawn in New York.  Dawn?  Hi.  How you doing?  Whoa.  How's sexy, Dawn?  What's up, Dawn?  We finished with politics, oil, and dogs.  What's that, sweetheart? 
[01:32:30]  We finished with the politics, the oil, and the dogs.  What would you like to talk about?  Yeah, what do you want?  I want to know.  Mm-hmm.  What about, do you ever play Tom Waits?  Well, Tom Waits is kind of a classic rocker, slower.  Do you mean on this show?  Why would we play Tom Waits?  You like the, uh, what's your favorite Tom Waits song?  Oh, come on.  He's got, like, 20 albums out there.  No kidding. 
[01:33:00]  But if you want to play one, you can play God's Way on Business.  But you don't have Tom Waits, do you?  No, we don't.  No.  And this is a radio station?  Hey, look, hey, you're preaching to the choir.  Oh, my God.  Listen, you deep-voiced dyke.  Listen, you disgusting-sounding whore.  What do you think?  Are you familiar enough?  You're not familiar enough with this to know it's a talk show, dummy?  Do you call up Larry King and request a song? 
[01:33:30]  You idiot.  You are a dunce.  We didn't spend years and years honing our craft so we don't have to play music so we can take calls from you.  Man voice.  Hey, man voice.  Ooh, you're hurting me now.  Yeah, you know I am.  Ooh.  Ooh, you're hurting me now.  Hey, all right, Herman Munster.  Listen to that.  Why don't you smoke 18 more cigarettes this hour?  18?  Yeah.  You're giving me credit. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  What are you listening to right now?  Tom Waits.  No, you're not.  What radio station are you listening to?  I thought I was listening to The Cutting Edge.  What are you talking about?  God, I hate you.  Tom Waits.  What radio station?  What radio station are you listening to?  K-92-3.  When did they remove your ovaries to give you that voice?  When did you ever hear the station play Tom Waits?  You had a complete removal of your female organs and no more female hormones are pumping 
[01:34:30]  through your body, right?  And what's it got to do with playing Tom Waits?  What's it got to do?  I'm right, though.  Yes.  Hey, Manhattan mini storage womb, we're trying to ask you a question.  Better off without a wife?  Is that the song you want to hear?  That thing just ends like it was bricked off after they removed all the goody parts.  Yeah, she had the procedure that's called the old ice cream scoop.  Take it all out and leaves you with a nice mustache and goatee. 
[01:35:00]  But my ears work fine.  Do they?  I can hear my voice is horrible.  I don't give a damn about it.  No, you do.  It hurts you, doesn't it?  It hurts you.  I've been living with it for 52 years.  52 years.  Do you like Tom Waits because he has a more feminine sounding voice than you do?  Exactly.  I don't think he has a melodic voice.  Melodic.  God, that voice.  When did he get divorced? 
[01:35:30]  When did your husband leave?  Same time your womb did?  Huh?  He's still here.  Oh, is he?  Yeah.  Yeah, unfortunately for him.  Well, listen, Tranny, are you happily married?  At times.  Are you attractive?  Are you kind of fat?  Are you a lovely looking girl?  Someone is very confused.  They're saying, it's Chris from Long Island.  I can't go to his phone call right now.  He's saying, is this Tom Waits calling in to request Tom Waits? 
[01:36:00]  Hey, Chris Sarandon from Dog Day Afternoon.  What exactly made you think that this station, you're not dying, Sonny.  You're killing everyone around you.  What makes you think that we played Tom Waits on this talk show?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is anybody in the station later?  No.  Not on the cutting edge.  Not on the station.  92-3, the cutting edge.  Well, isn't he cutting edge?  No.  Well, what is he?  He's an older man.  No one...  An older man? 
[01:36:30]  You ask...  Lily, Lily, Grandpa, could you play Tom Waits, Grandpa?  So I'll never hear like the Rolling Stones or anything like that on this station.  Yeah?  You're too old.  Well, the Rolling Stones are your ovaries.  Fine, fine, fine  Make all the jokes you want  But you don't play Tom Waits  Toot in common womb 
[01:37:00]  That's right  You don't play Tom Waits  And I don't reproduce  So we're even  How old's your son?  13  And he loves Tom Waits  I couldn't love Tom Waits  Enough about Tom Waits  She probably just plays it 24 hours a day  In our house  Happens  No one knows what to do with Tom Waits  Tom Waits  The radio programmers have never figured out  What to do with Tom Waits  Sure they have  Don't play him  Maybe they should try playing him 
[01:37:30]  Yeah  And then what happens?  Everybody will buy his CD  And then everyone will stop buying iPods  Throw his CDs in the same bio-waste container  Your woman parts are in  That's what I say  How about this?  We'll play Tom Waits  If you can tell me how old he is  He is 58  He'll be 59 in December  I lied, bitch  Why am I not surprised? 
[01:38:00]  Do you know who you're talking to even?  Yeah, do you know the name of this show?  Opie and Anthony  What do you know about Opie and Anthony?  I know you mellowed a lot  Since you came to this station  Oh, damn, that's going to hurt  We did  In what way, ma'am?  In what way?  Yeah  You just talk about dog tricks and oil  Oil and dog tricks  What's a dog trick?  All right 
[01:38:30]  Speaking of oil, how much of it do you need for your husband to have any satisfaction?  The dog ate the person's toe  Woohoo  Hey, it's Howard  Yeah, that's a real story  Yeah, but then it led into like old people getting eaten by their pets  Which was a fine conversation  So, miss, you don't think it's worth talking about when a dog eats its owner's toe off and she doesn't notice it?  You don't think that's worthy of making fun of?  Kind of funny  You're a tough one  It doesn't faze me in the least 
[01:39:00]  Of course it doesn't because you probably have three toes left  Old sugar feet  Yeah  What happened to your parts?  You go a little too deep with the peanut butter?  That was enjoyable  Oh, I'm sorry  This is the wrong story  I'm going to stay  Andy  You know, Marilyn  I don't have any womanly parts  Grandpa, could you whip me up some ovaries? 
[01:39:30]  You have to take my womb  Darn, darn, darn, darn  Go to the hospital, Grandpa  I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't  Get in drag, you little human  I'll take you  Grandpa  I'd love that demo  Bye-bye  Oh, she went away 
[01:40:00]  Oh, boy  Damn her  Whip me up some ovaries, Grandpa  Grandpa, I need fallopian tubes  Okay, Hyman  God damn, I hate her  Ugh  Dawn  Tom Waits  Tom Waits  God, what's that funny? 
[01:40:30]  How did that come from?  Very good  Very good  Alright  Step aside  Don't play the Casey  We're late  It's amazing  She doesn't like the show  So we immediately imply  That she has no womb  But I think we were right  But just  Hey, I'm not enjoying your show  Alright, let's attack the heart of her humanity  Oh, God 
[01:41:00]  Hey, I'm not taking your show  Ha-ha  You can't reproduce  We are horrible  Oh, right  Ha-ha  Ha-ha  Ha-ha  I gotta pee  Come on  Opie and Anthony  Bitter, angry motherfuckers  Fuck, fuck  Opie and Anthony  Jimmy's a realist  You're a racist  Fuck  And I'm clueless  You've got the lies in the grave 
[01:41:30]  You've got the lies in the grave  You've got the lies in the grave  Now let me get a move on  Woo-hoo  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show 
[01:42:00]  Of course, we've got to come back with a little Tom Waits for everybody  Oh, that's what that garbage was?  Yeah  877-212-ON-A  So remember  Do you remember  From about an hour ago  When Stunt Brain fell flat on his face?  We want to enjoy that a little bit more right now  Ah  What did you say, Stunt Brain?  A mere hour ago 
[01:42:30]  I said rather confidently  That I believe Chris Matthews  Was in the tank for Hillary  And that's why he set that Texas senator up  To make Obama look bad  Or make the senator look bad  For supporting Obama  Also makes Obama kind of look bad  Because he hasn't done anything  That is worthy of remembering  Right  Chris Matthews asked his senator  Just to reset  You know, he's an Obama supporter  So he goes, alright  Tell me what Obama has done  And the senator, of course, couldn't name one thing 
[01:43:00]  It's great audio  If you want to look it up  We'll have it linked on  Ownaradio.com  It's there, sir  Okay, good  So, when we were having that discussion  You said that Chris Matthews is what?  A huge  Huge Hillary supporter  Sure  And he was setting up Obama  To tank him  Yeah  This was during the campaign  In February  Yeah  Well, enjoy this clip  You always talk about  How we always put a dreamer out there  And we always believe  But in the end  Machine always beats the man  John Henry always dies at the end 
[01:43:30]  Loses to the railroad  There is never  The railroad always wins  You're breaking my heart  With my own story  It's a heartbreaking story  Chris Matthews  This morning  He's bringing tears to his eyes  It's a heartbreaking  Is it not the case  This morning, Wednesday morning  On January 30th  Can we not say with certainty  That once again  The dreamer has died  And the machine has won  Wow  He's going to cry  Of course, they're talking about Obama  Yes, they are  And Matthews was going to cry  Because his guy  Was looking bad for his guy 
[01:44:00]  Right  This guy, not his girl  Right  Not Hillary  Right  I'm going to make a call right now  Excuse me  You're interrupted again  By the news, sir  But here it is  Barack Obama  The senator from Illinois  The junior senator from Illinois  Has won  The Iowa caucuses  The Democratic caucuses  In Iowa  The first big test  Of the 2008 presidential campaign  I'm telling you, Keith  History  This is Lexington and Concord  This is going around the world right now  I'll say it again  In Rangoon  They're putting their front page

[01:45:00]  Would be a new political term  But thanks for coining that  That's  But you're right  This is something we talked about  Is that Keith Olbermann?  That's a funny line  Yuck  Yuck  So wait  I like the fact that he gives  Obama the junior senator  And yet he calls Hillary  The president's wife  The president's wife  That's not a guy that likes Hillary  No it's not  No  He's not a person  A bear trap  You've been corrected sir  You know how many times  We watch people squirm

[01:49:00]  I think perhaps  He was lost  Mm-hmm  Sorry  No it's okay  He was hoping  The little boy  Would have proper directions  I'm thinking  The little boy  Had washed his hands  Like a good little boy  And he needed paper towels  But they were too high  So he helped him  You know what I'm thinking  What are you thinking  Uncle Paul  What  Perhaps  I've had this issue before  Yeah  Perhaps he saw him  Stealing something  And was gonna search him 
[01:49:30]  For the merchandise  Oh  Give him like  A little search  Yeah  Yeah  Get back them  Star Wars figures  You gotta pat them  Down a little  Oh yeah  Yeah  See where they hide them  Oh god  You are a ghoul  You really are man  Let's get back to the story  Everyone has their guesses  Out there in Radio Land  Mm-hmm  Fourteen years ago  She says  Alan Patton  Approached her  Four-year-old son  In the bathroom  At Magic Mountain  On Bryce Road 
[01:50:00]  He was like  Right behind me  Like  To my back right  Um  Like trying to reinforce  The fact that  They need to pee  In the bucket  Rather than  In the stall  They thought  They'd never hear  The name Alan Patton  Again  Once he went to jail  It's an outrage  That they keep  Letting him off  Two weeks ago  Police caught Patton  At Sports Ohio  In Dublin  He was charged  With criminal mischief  For turning off  The urinals  So he could collect  Urine in cups  2006  Patton admitted  To Gehanna police  That he suffers 
[01:50:30]  From urophilia  He collects  And drinks  Young boys urine  Even though  It makes me sick  He told police  It is a release  For me  It's almost spiritual  I feel like  It makes me closer  To them  Like I'm drinking  Their youth  Judge Kerry Blatton  Sent Patton to jail  For probation violations  A few years ago  And placed him  On a GPS system  Where his movements  Were limited  To work and home  GPS  Yeah  If you cross  A bathroom  It goes off  GPS system  How much of a creep 
[01:51:00]  Are you  That you have  A GPS  GPS on you  Well this guy  Is pretty damn creepy  Does he touch the kids  Or is he just  Into the urine  I think he just says  Go in the bucket  And then takes the bucket  With him  And obviously  Then he uses it  That's what he does  Right  Like Sonny D  You should see  You should see the  Sad look on his face  When he turns  The container  And it's empty  Oh no  Can't get this  In the store  Yeah  This isn't  In the juice aisle  Yeah it's kind of  Hard to pick up  They have every flavor 
[01:51:30]  Imaginable  But they don't  Have this flavor  He's bucket guy  When everything's  Broken in the bathroom  Yeah  Hey  You know  I'm here to help  You out kid  And placed him  On a GPS system  Where his movements  Were limited  To work and home  There was a whole list  Of places he could not go  Which would include  Public restrooms  But also basically  Any place  Where any child  Might be  Patton is a tier 3  Sex offender  Whose only requirement  After leaving jail  Was to notify  The sheriff's office  When he moves  Tonight he's back 
[01:52:00]  At home  Living with his mother  His former victim  Believes there's only  One place he should be  Behind bars  I think he needs  To be just put a  Put a what?  Put a what?  Put in a bathroom  With a bucket  There you go  Put a pedestal  And worshipped  Is that  It's like this  Former victim  Is  It's a bit older  Really thinking  Is it  Really a victim  Thing  I mean  It's  You're kind of going 
[01:52:30]  Apparently the guy  Wasn't touching anything  Right  He would just say  Hey this is broken  Use this  And then you carry  Off the bucket  I don't know  Is that  What is that?  Besides  I mean  I'm not saying  The guy isn't  Sick and twisted  But  It's a very good question  Does it leave  Does it leave  The person that  You know  The kid  Traumatized  I would imagine  As much as  You know  I would say no  I would say no  Weird  I think it'd be  Kind of goofy 
[01:53:00]  If you were a kid  Should be watched  If you tell your friends  And go  Dude  Guess what this guy did  I think as a little  Like boy  You're laughing  With your friends  You're not going to believe  What this weirdo did  I don't think  You're sitting there  Going  Yeah  You made me do it  In a bucket  And  Yeah  Yeah  As long as he's not  Touching them  I don't know  It's kind of  I mean he's got to be  Stopped obviously  But you know  That's weird  Yeah  Hey come on  You probably saved  The school system  A lot of money  On the water bill  Sure  They probably  Take lemons 
[01:53:30]  Make lemonade  Well  I wonder  Won't drink any of his  I wonder when this guy  Got out of prison  If they didn't throw him  A little party  And you know  Like when  Like when  Like a team wins  The Super Bowl  And they have to do  The Gatorade  Oh wow  Yeah  Just cart that thing  Around to every junior high  That's a strange one  I don't know  You bring up a good question 
[01:54:00]  Are you a victim  I mean he is a creep  You know  All that  We know that  Yeah but  Yeah  How victimized are you  By having to go through that  It's not like  A rape or something  You know  And how old is the kid now  18 I guess  18  That's what all Mr. Hanalei  Would do in the Brady Bunch  Mr. Hanalei  Can we do a montage  Of coaches getting  Doused with Gatorade  Because now that  Look at that picture  Oh that'd be good  Yeah  Oh he'd be like  Oh I'm out of jail

[01:58:30]  That's some good stats for the first day out  13 dead is amazing news  Not dead, unfortunately  Just injured  Injured  A lot of hiney holes have been ruptured  Oh, that hurts  Yeah  Let me get a big bullhorn  Oof  They're just like locomotives  Those things  Right in the old fart box  Now we gotta let the delay build  877-212-ON-A 
[01:59:00]  Also, there was something  There was something  I'm thinking  Yeah, well, Jimmy doesn't  Jimmy, you don't like the running of the bulls, right?  I despise it  Yeah, I'm with you  I despise bullfighting  It's just silly  It's a bunch of machismo jerk-offs  Trying to prove what men they are  I love when they get just speared by a bull  Yeah  It's like, why do you need a weapon?  The bull's just got his head  Oh, they, yeah  Everybody knows now 
[01:59:30]  They pretty much torture it  Before the matador even gets to them  Matador  I can't tell you how badly  I want matadors just to be killed by drunk drivers  I got the toreador  And then the picador  A little faggity outfit  A lot of them  What?  Yes, there's the toreador  I believe he's the one that rides the horse  Okay  Right?  And then the picador  Uh-huh  Yeah, I think he's the one that throws the spears in his back  I'm not sure  A door  Where did you learn this? 
[02:00:00]  Obviously not from  El  Duntbrain  Discovery-o El Channel-o  Forget Aristotle  And fuck Socrates  Whoa  Here comes Professor Anthony  One man gorged on  Oh, the stats are way down now  We just did this story  Running of the Bulls  One man gored on day two  13 injured on day one  Only one on day two  Day one's always the big one  That stinks  Yeah  That stupid hat they wear 
[02:00:30]  You don't like that?  It looks like it has Mickey Mouse ears  I hate them  Like with their little capes  Look, the bull runs into the cape  Get out of the way  The bulls run into the cape  Ha ha ha  You're wearing over your waist  Fruit  He's so brave  I just  Just despise them  Never seen a bullfight live  Why would I?  I literally  I would love to drop napalm in the arena 
[02:01:00]  And anyone who's enjoying that  Could just die  Man against beast  Not into that whole  Fight fair  Yeah, it's really not man against beast  If you had like  Slown down drastically  Before you get to it  Unless it's in a small Oregon farm  Yeah, exactly  Seattle, you goose  Oh, it's Seattle  Why do I always think it's Oregon?  Because that's where you would go  Yeah  The horses are much more cordial there  Much more gentle  The chickens and the hens are in Oregon  Horses and donkeys  Look at this bull with a spear 
[02:01:30]  Hanging out of his neck  And the matador  Yeah  All brave right there  He's wearing pink boots  And holding a red thing  And the animal's just confused  And going  Why can't I just trample this nothing?  Why can't I just trample this thing?  Maybe because he's got spears in him  Why can't you just leave me in a field somewhere  And let me be?  Exactly  Why am I in front of all these people  With a spear hanging from my neck?  You mean my giant testes  Just walking around  Enjoying life  Eating wheat?  Wheat?  That's probably the problem over there 
[02:02:00]  You know the bull has  Big  And that you know  Makes people sad  So they have to do this to the bull  To show him who's boss  Yeah  Any type of like  Macho display like that  It just makes you want to  Again  Just pick up a rifle  And just blast the guy's face  Just shoot him  Holla  Holla to that Jimmy  Then we got this  Police arrested this man  38 year old  Jared Conway  Following a chase  In a car crash  Around 6 this morning  By the way  I gotta openly say 
[02:02:30]  That this story  Kinda makes me chuckle  A little bit  I say that before you hear  What happened  Cause it's just so  Bizarre  And effed up  Hmm  I try to go inside  These people's heads  Yeah  To try to understand  Why  Chase in a car crash  Around 6 this morning  In North Modesto  Inside the trunk  Of his gray Honda Civic  They found a missing  14 year old girl  Horrible obviously  But it makes me  Like it laugh  Like  What the hell's wrong 
[02:03:00]  With you  That it comes to the point  Where you're  Shumming a girl  In your trunk  She's dead or alive  How are we gonna find out  Jimmy  They found a missing  14 year old girl  She was flown to UCD  Med Center  With severe injuries  Conway is a registered  Sex offender  Who had moved in  With the girl's family  On Garvey Avenue  About a month ago  Her father reported  The girl missing  Around 3 a.m  Police arrived  And were investigating  The scene  Around 6 a.m  They spotted the suspect 
[02:03:30]  Driving by  And a chase ensued  Before he was caught  Neighbors are stunned  I just think about  The whole thing  It could have been  One of our kids  You know  Anybody's kids  No it couldn't  You weren't cute enough  That's it  Keep letting sex offenders  Out of jail  That's good  I don't get that at all  That's great  That's great  Make bank robbery  25 years to life  But let sex offenders  Out in 6 years  Good  One city wants to  Pack all their sex offenders  Into a 3 block area 
[02:04:00]  Problem is  It could be right next  To your house  Sex offenders  May be in your house  At 11  Neighbors are stunned  I just think about  The whole thing  It could have been  One of our kids  You know  Anybody's kids  I think it's pretty crazy  I mean I can't believe  That happened right down  The road  Of course you can't  Why can't you believe it  Why  If it happened on Jupiter  I would be stunned  If somebody was molested  Where  On Jupiter  I don't believe it  I'm stunned  I forgot that 
[02:04:30]  Jimmy hates  The man on the street  Oh who doesn't  Participation  It's worthless banter  It really is  Neighbors were shocked  Were you really shocked  Do we really know  What our neighbors  Are up to  What neighbor  Wouldn't be shocked  Who would go  The pedophile  The kid at the 14 year old  Who didn't know  That was happening  Yeah  According to police  The suspect  Was a long time friend  Of the victim's parents  But there's no telling  If the parents knew  Way to pay attention  Parents  Long time friend 
[02:05:00]  We have been for six years  I'm working  Freaking no signs  What so ever  In that long term friendship  According to police  The suspect  Was a long time friend  Of the victim's parents  But there's no telling  If the parents knew  Of Conway's criminal past  Whether the family  Knew this or not  Whether neighbors  In the area  Knew this or not  We don't know  But what we do know  Is that his name  His face  And his address  Are all  On the Megan's Law website  Right there for viewing  Check it regularly 
[02:05:30]  Parents need to be  Very concerned about that  And take those reasonable  And responsible steps  To make sure  Their family is safe  Meanwhile the teenage girl  Who was flown here  Is expected  Sisters to survive  Now the suspect  Is under arrest  For kidnapping  And resisting arrest  He may face  More charges  Just kill him  Just squash him  Like a bug  Just kill him  Why do they leave  These people  On this planet  Because we shouldn't 
[02:06:00]  Be playing God  I don't care  No we should  And it costs  More money to kill him  That's what I hear  Money well spent  Absolutely  Of course it is  For the family  Great money spent  You know it costs  More to have  Somebody executed  Than it  Shit it  Shit it  You get  You get  You get what  You pay for  That's what  I say  So  Eliminate him  I want to say  Hi to my buddies

[02:35:00]  yeah he knew exactly where the safe place was  yeah  and that was his job that day  was to get into the safe place  so it would look like he got injured  and the wrestlers all came to his aid  yeah  they're all working together  to help him  he was seriously injured  yeah  and so they've been  uh trying to  to as vince would say  the show must go on  you know how sick he is  no he's hurt  he's not a very sick man  no he's injured  he did the whole death thing last year  and then what's his name  blew up his spot

[02:40:00]  while vince is hurt  what kind of injury  have they  yeah did they discuss  what's injured with him  well this is what  some of the clips  will shed some light on  ah  he's kind of a private  person  happened to  his dick get hurt  what the fuck  oh come on  oh i'm sorry  respect i understand  vicky guerrero  emotionally sends  thoughts and prayers  to vince mcmahon  is this the older one  thoughts and prayers  thoughts and prayers  alright cause we've  we've kind of  blown off the  vince mcmahon angle  i'm sorry sam  we didn't really  feel like it was 
[02:40:30]  worth doing on  our radio show  vacation  but these things  are piling up  so we figured  we'd do a little  clean up today  alright well i thought  it was more of a  topical thing  who the hell is  this fruit  oh my god  whoa  wow  that could be  the gayest  black man i've  ever seen  he's got a  lipstick on  and a lavender  top  who is this  it's rupaul  without the wig  yeah  can i get the  sound on danny  loud micah  to continue  saving the 
[02:41:00]  family property  no that's upstairs  that's that one  can face up to  a year in prison  and a ten thousand  dollar fine  for what  what  that was the  cnn one  we need the  msnbc  we need the  fruity guy  on msnbc  that looks like  rupaul  jimmy's right  yeah  where is it  no no  i mean  oh jesus  oh danny  oh danny  oh danny  go go go  he's learning  from experience  you know  the lesson  of that  debate  was that 
[02:41:30]  well no  the lesson  of that  debate  and the  moral  of that  story  which he admits  and we'll talk about  today  is essentially  you know  what he heard  in the context  of this discussion  was we need to  secure our borders  first and then we need  to move methodically  to a compassionate  approach to illegal  immigration  let me just say  something about  that  i don't think  there's learning  from experience  if barack obama  had done the same  thing they would say  he's flip-flopping  which is exactly  which is exactly  which is exactly  what john mccain  has done here  he has flip-flopped  his position  this guy loves  cock  he loves cock 
[02:42:00]  barack obama  just said he would  refine  he'd be willing  to refine his  timetable  to withdraw the  troops  depending on  what he finds  isn't that  learning from  experience  isn't he saying  i'm willing to  learn from experience  that's right  barack obama  hasn't said  he's not going to  withdraw the troops  from iraq  in fact the iraqi  prime minister  wants the troops  withdrawn from iraq  on the timetable  so i don't think  he's changed  his position  on that issue  of course  if that thing  had a wig on  and was hanging  around the meatpacking  district  why not  for some political  commentary  can you talk  into this 
[02:42:30]  like strangle  you with that  fucking purple  tie  just when  the getting  gets good  have us back  on this one  alright thank you  guys  a soldier  whose image  captured the  personal drama  of the iraq war  is now being  remembered as a  soldier  i'm doing bad  improv on a  fucking tv show  that no one  can see but us  you know you're  bombing when the  eight people that  can see them  aren't laughing  that means nobody  in radio land  was either  yes you're the  big neck  so young sam  roberts 
[02:43:00]  so we play  oh right sam  what do we do  the uh vicky  guerrero emotionally  sends this was  this was the first  yeah so vicky  that was done  after the fake  that was fake  hurt  alright that  after the injury  i love the new  steve  can i say  i can literally  talk about steve  for fuck it  from 6 to 11  every day  i love steve  why is he hibernating  yes  why is he hibernating  i was hibernating  because i'm  i have to hibernate  because i'm tired  i'm a bear  and i need to 
[02:43:30]  sleep  yeah  yeah daddy's  literal  yes because bears  hibernate  that's what they do  when i'm a bear  steve  where's steve  steve  i'm checking the  mail for improv  skills  none today  publisher's clearing  house  say i may have  won improv  skills  yes i get it  i have no improv  skills  where is he right 
[02:44:00]  now he's probably  doing freeze improv  it's fucking  direct  freeze improv  okay freeze  someone in the  audience pick an  occupation  that's right  producer  i have no idea  what that is  look how angry  you look  oh no  oh look i'm full of  water  oh he's pouring  water down  oh god he just  poured water  down his back  how's that for  improv  i'm sorry  my improv  was a little weak  that was actually  better than anything 
[02:44:30]  else you've ever done  thank you  i've had water  down jim's back  oh is that wet  i don't know  i was in derrick's  studio doing  production so what  i usually do is  when i'm in there  doing a production  is and and some  intern walks in  and goes they're  talking about you  they're talking  about you okay  why don't you  with the headphones  tell me what the  fuck they're talking  about so i don't  walk into a hail  of gunfire  uh and why would  they do that  oh because it's  what it's because  it's what sam and  danny and trevis  have taught them all  to do it's don't  don't tell steve  what the fuck is  going on  yeah but you 
[02:45:00]  just today it's  true you ask us  where you've been  sitting there in  front of today  supposedly listening  to the show and  then you say what's  going on  you were noticed  no  oh shit  absolutely not  true  anarchy sit back  no it's not  anarchy um because  that would imply that  they've actually  outranked me which  they don't  uh that's not what  anarchy implies at  all that's not what  anarchy means that  we don't outrank you  but we're uprising  that's not gonna 
[02:45:30]  happen either  anyway point is um  i sometimes i'm i'm  wrapped up in five  different things and  i'm politely asking  what's going on and  latex  lycra  yes  thank you  yes  honey  fur and  ceiling  that's three  i like the way it  feels on my body  thank you  so wait but you're  what do you say like 
[02:46:00]  i'm asking what are you  accusing steve of i've  actually  no i wasn't i was young  sam roberts my name  was thrown under the  bus first for the  record so why i don't  know he said he claims  that he's in the  production studio and  then we don't tell him  what's happening on the  show but a lot of times  he'll be called into the  studio and ask what's  going on and he won't  have been in the  production studio he'll  have been in the office  on the phone with the  show on talking to  roland there's a there's  a dozen other things  that have to get done  and i'm asking politely  if you guys can help me  out and sometimes they're  just just go on in  they're talking about 
[02:46:30]  you go on in they're  talking about you  that's how it should  work  danny you're gonna get  out of you if you know  what's going on oh  thank you well at least  i know that they've been  told thank you danny  your take i have a  difficult time uh-oh i  have a difficult time  shutting up when you  should projecting my  opinions because  because of things that  have danny gets angry  because of things that  have happened in the  past because they come  out like gunnery sergeant  there's some diplomacy  happening here but sam 
[02:47:00]  what what's going on  sam has no problem in  saying what is going on  well what's going on  talking about talking  in a roundabout way  well danny has to talk  in a roundabout way  because he gets very  upset with certain  things well no because  but because before the  christmas break danny had  a little punishment  that happened so so  danny's not allowed to  talk about steve anymore  uh-oh yeah that's what  happened what's going on  what i missed that double  secret probation pretty  much yeah danny got the 
[02:47:30]  old red warning perhaps  of talking to yeah well  if you're allowed a bit  more let's let's if you  if you are allowed to talk  about steve yeah no that  one won't work either since  i'm asking on the air it's  acceptable it's not being  disrespectful to him as the  producer what what would  be something you would  say in candor without  rancor it's an improv game  yes oh no  he dumped water down my 
[02:48:00]  back  um well what's the issue  unfortunately i must decline  to speak because i like  coming to work and having a  job  and if i if i speak uh ill in  any kind of ill light  then i have to  then i have to worry about i  have to worry about my my  lengthy career in the radio  business  how about this we'll have to  do this if you speculate  what's the quality in a person  if you were to work for them 
[02:48:30]  or what is something  theoretically that would drive  you crazy  doesn't have to be something  that's going on here it could  be a theoretical quality  good question  that's a fair question and  the human resources listen you  can't fault you for answering  no especially on air  well i like i look for um  and this doesn't it doesn't  apply here this applies for any  place where i would i would  work for  improvisation skills  yeah that and uh i always look  for uh leadership skills in a 
[02:49:00]  leader  i'll start there  sam  uh yeah i mean  thank you for throwing that to  me at that point  that's obviously very helpful  that was just uncomfortable  i mean as far as leaders go  like leadership  i don't know if it's like if  it's accompanied with it but  uh having like an idea of what  the fuck is going on  that's good  what else are you looking for  in a leader danny  back to danny  man  this is some tennis game 
[02:49:30]  sure is  i feel like arthur x  i don't know  uh  let me try to deflect  oh what do you look for an  employee  yeah  oh no steve's scrolling though  that's never a good sign  no it  scroll scroll scroll scroll  scroll scroll  scroll scroll  steve what's your feelings  obviously you have to be heard  from  yeah steve  um  give me that  what can i say  it's um  sometimes challenging  to lead in an organization  where the powers that be 
[02:50:00]  constantly call you  incompetent and homosexual  uh  and you expect your  subordinates to actually  respect you when that's  going on on a daily basis  well um  sam obviously it's back to you  uh  yeah i mean you know  we all know you actually  run the show  secretly behind the scenes  yeah  of course  but that's on air stuff  we goof on you on air  yeah but see  i guess  okay which one  which one do you want us  to stop saying  yeah  we can only pick one  yes  which one do you want us 
[02:50:30]  to stop saying  which by proxy means  which one would you like  double  exactly  i know  believe me i've been doing  this long enough  what is it ten years now  yeah  yes faggot  no i'm teasing steve  i know  steve knows i i really  you know  we all like steve  we all like him  a lot  of course we do  yeah  i mean a lot  yeah  all right so what were you 
[02:51:00]  saying steve  i didn't mean to interrupt you  um  the point is  uh sometimes the  staff gets a little  confused as to what is  just on air  and what's real life  and um  that's true  and uh  when they hear you guys  calling me out  and calling me a fag  calling me incompetent  you know all those  wonderful things  that i have to deal with  on a on a basis  sometimes the tooling  doesn't end  and i have to catch  when do i tool on you steve  copious amounts of shit  uh behind the scenes  and i'm not saying  it's happened recently 
[02:51:30]  i'm not saying  it's happened recently  and i'm not pointing my finger  at you again  i just want to clear the air  because it's just  the way that you're making it sound  it's like you're accusing me  of doing these things  no dani  you've actually been very well  behaved recently  i have to be  oh  dani's been doing  a very good job  of biting his tongue  yeah dani's been biting  his tongue quite well  lately  and i've been biting  a pillow  that goes in the fag column  yes  oh boy can i see  the lawsuit now 
[02:52:00]  they constantly  called me  yes exactly  it was  1048  and i went along  with it too  uh  no  but it's all on air  oh my god  i understand that jim  you understand that  mine is so good  i mean you have to realize  like people are going to  pick and choose  what they want to uh  pay attention to  yeah it's almost like  nobody calls you  like a  an animal who  hibernates  for real  but they don't really 
[02:52:30]  treat you like a bear  off air  do they steve  i'm trying to think  i think that  no that's actually  been one that they  haven't  see  so thank you  you pulled out an  accurate sample  because they don't  think you're a bear  exactly  what am i agreeing to  i don't know  anyway  can i go back to  production now  oh no this is  producing this is  important stuff  oh  oh  hold on  hello  oh my god  hi how are you 
[02:53:00]  who's on the phone  ant  it's my  gun guy  i'm i'm on the air  you're not on the air  i'm just on the air  taking a call  yeah  anthony says  your guns suck dick  people start yelling  out things  anthony says  your guns suck dick  my asshole  co-worker  this is my rifle  so i know you like it  but this one is mine  and they're assholes  so pay no attention  is that the guy  you were calling a  fag earlier on our  show  you said it was 
[02:53:30]  a little faggy  so what's the  scoop  yes  you have that gun  with the cock head  on it or not  i'm gonna shoot  myself in the colon  okay  okay  well mr kumi  a bad news  we can't put afros  on all the targets  what is the  petty  we're saying  right now  i'll get back to you  after i get out of  this horrible  working environment 
[02:54:00]  yes  and i'll let you  know sir  that's right  that's right  killer  thanks man  thanks man  bye  see you're not  gonna shake up  gun people  but with your  your vulgar  language  doesn't help  sorry  are we gonna  move on with  vince mcmahon  and elo's gonna  be calling any  second right  oh it's gotta be  what 35 minutes  he said  yeah  I'd rather hear  more danny's 
[02:54:30]  comments  yeah  shut up  i'll text you  later  oh shit  was there anything  you were gonna say  that you couldn't  get to say  yeah i wanted to  say what you  need to say  now sam  you mean in  the improv game  yeah  yeah he's not  listening now  like if a leader  you play the  improv game  i'll do the  improv game  and if a leader  said that uh  like powers of  be were calling  him gay and  incompetent  then i guess it  would also be up  to the leader to  prove them  wrong  oh 
[02:55:00]  hypothetically  hypothetically  theoretically  comment  i'm in  production  oh shit  what about  the other  four and a  half hours  oh  he's gonna  come screaming  in here  does steve  get angry  though  he's gonna  come running  in here  but he doesn't  why doesn't he  respond like  he's not  yelling but  the truth  he doesn't  respond  no buddy  where is he  steve 
[02:55:30]  where'd you  go  sometimes i  just forget  we're even  on the air  oh steve's  in the other  room listening  to everything  oh  he can hear us  steve  come in  yeah come  in  you're  this is  knocking  in good  look at  faggy  travis runs  away because  he doesn't  want to be  involved in  this at  all  he was in  here doing  something and  he just runs  off  no i came in  here because i  couldn't be in  there anymore  with steve while  you guys were  talking  why  it's a little  uncomfortable  does he touch 
[02:56:00]  you in places  where your bathing  seat covers  for the gay  column  this is gonna  be that's  gonna be some  deposition  oh yeah  you're right  jim  yeah  and then he  accused me of  touching the  twink that  answers the  phones  and did you  not say and i  quote you're a  cum sucking  boob  yes but it's  all in context  this would not 
[02:56:30]  read well in a  transcription  no i'm not a  boob  i hate boobs  why is travis  why is travis  uncomfortable  that is why  huh  why are you  uncomfortable  yeah same  same reason you  were uh  uncomfortable  when it was  going on in  here  i'm not  comfortable at  all  not even a  little i mean  i'm listening  to everybody  talk  well you know  when you got  people uh  going back 
[02:57:00]  and forth in  this tennis  match and  then steve's  standing right  behind you  while it's all  going on  it's open  dialogue  you really want  to laugh  hysterically  well i can't  you i would  laugh if i  wanted to  laugh or i  would try  there's a lot  of hate in  this room  that's obvious  what the fuck  want to get  uncomfortable  let's go  yeah steve  call me out  and being  uncomfortable  what's your  take i don't  want you to  feel like no  one's listening  i'm not being  uncomfortable  pregnancy no  improv skills  there's not a  lot of love  in this room  we want to 
[02:57:30]  go with this  let's go  oh god  steve  oh i'm fine  i'm sure you  are  yeah  comment  on  which one  we were talking  about you  thank you  they were  discussing you  i think i'll go  improv a review  oh the old  d ross suspension  coming  yeah  oh is that  what they're  calling it  now  the old d ross  the old d ross  you got 
[02:58:00]  dannied  no sam had a  better name  but wasn't that  the old uh that  was the old shit  can mcgillicuddy  yeah  it's the old shit  can mcgillicuddy  that was danny's own  nickname coming prime  time's way  shit can mcgillicuddy  oh that's a good  one  who do you think's  gonna get shit  can sent  oh i don't know  i guess it depends  it really depends  on how far this  conversation goes  and who dominates  it  well we're all  talking on the air  i don't think  anybody can fault  anybody for anything  said on the air  i mean we're asking  so it's not like 
[02:58:30]  anybody's being  belligerent  i actually had a  conversation with  don wicklin  you remember him  don't you  barely  with don wicklin  cool  when uh that  was it hard to talk  with just making  eye contact  that hole in the  stall  i was doing all  the talking  his mouth was  full of my  cock  he was reading  his lips through  a buddy booth  oh danny  seems like he's  pulling up the  screen saying  channel 57 
[02:59:00]  i had a  conversation with  him um during  shit can mcgillicuddy's  uh crisis time  there uh trying  to pretty much  you know talk  him out of it  because i don't  like seeing  anybody  being put on  double secret  probation  and i voiced  the concern  i said  what if  anything is  on the air  i go on the  air we have to  be able to go  back and forth  and i remember  him saying  anything goes  on the air  as long as it  doesn't get carried  off the air 
[02:59:30]  into that  so you're  fucking safe  i feel like  danny and me  are just  producing content  because you know  we're producers  that is true  however as  novel of an  idea that is  it's fun  it's fun to say  yeah  it's not  ants  what do you  think  what's going  on  you can't get  in trouble  for stuff  you're saying  on the air  no  no  not  because i mean  while it is  uncomfortable  in this room  it'll be even  more uncomfortable 
[03:00:00]  in my living room  when i can't  afford my electric  bill  yeah  so  why would they  very warm  very warm  it's very muggy  in queens  well can we  at least  working on the  phone  with somebody  on the phone  i don't want  to hear anybody  badmouthing  anybody  i just want  to see what's  going on  the phone's  been turned  off in  washington  yeah  pretty much  we could  try  um  well  damn good  sandwich  should we  take a break  great entertainment  too  thank you  gentlemen  yeah  dinner  dinner  and show

[03:01:30]  diarrhea  there's no  other way  around it  i smelled  diarrhea  is it  is it  swamp ass  i don't  it smells  like swamp  ass  i hung out  with a lot  of kids  over our  mini vacation  and i know  the smell  of baby  diapers  yeah  it has  that baby  diaper  diarrhea  smell  right  you smell  it too  now  well i did  before and i  also caught a  whiff of something  eerily similar  yesterday  so who was in  here it was steve  you eroc  uh  travis was in  here for a  little while 
[03:02:00]  travis  somebody has  diarrhea  in their  pants  someone's got  like fucking  swamp ass  let's get  everybody back  in here  where your  asshole  is so like  fucked up  from shitting  badly  from straining  or whatever  and then the  sweat drips  down in there  and soaks  through your  underwear  and your  pants  right  and lo and  behold  the odor  of asshole  is now  outside your  pants  enjoy that  tuna  jimmy  jimmy just 
[03:02:30]  got so  disgusting  that was so  awful  i'm just  describing  swamp ass  thank you  all right  eroc  get to the  studio  it's eroc  that's eroc  the smell  okay who's  gonna smell  eroc  ass crack  so we  know  who smells  we got  i don't know  what's his name  we'll smell  travis will you  smell buttholes  today  you gotta smell  it might be me  i shouldn't smell 
[03:03:00]  you gotta smell  all over eroc's body  who wants to smell  buttholes today  it doesn't matter  who wants  smelling  smelling  ass  it's through  the pans  it defeats  the purpose  if you're  smelling  actual  asshole  because  they'll  all smell  like ass  i'll smell  eric's  asshole  really  yes of course  if i have  to sure  all right  now what  eric has  to do  is kind  of just  lean  against the  console  and kind  of spread 
[03:03:30]  your legs  apart  a little  open that  up  that way  it's not  hiding  in a crease  sure  all right  spread your  legs  all right  there you  go  smell  that too  but i was  gonna say  if you're  like that  your butthole  is kind  of  like on  the floor  so he  should  kind  of  be in  a chair  i'm  thinking  kind  of  like  at a  gyno  exam  because that  way  it would  allow for  a better  angle  so if 
[03:04:00]  you sit  in the  chair  and lift  your legs  up  don't sit  in my  chair  diarrhea  butt  he could  be vindicated  here  i think  he will  be  but i  why you're  not smelling  it  no  uh  yeah there's  something going  on in  eroc  i haven't  gone today  what  i haven't  gone  today  you're  probably  turtling  down to  your underwear  might not  be eroc  down to  your underwear  why do we  have to go  gay 
[03:04:30]  because if  you smelled  it when he  walked in  you'd smell  it through  his pants  yeah but  obviously but  we want to  get a real  good  i agree  with anthony  i think  pants is  good  you know  you're not  gonna be able  to smell  it right  and the last  thing you want  is for you  to say that  eroc smells  and he doesn't  if he hasn't  washed his  pants that's  one thing  if it's a  diarrhea ass  it's a whole  separate thing  it's gonna  smell like my  computer chair  when we were  off for two  years  who feels like  eroc should be  in his underpants  i do  of course  everybody  put your hand  up anthony  show her you  can do it  everyone except

[03:12:30]  ELO  hi Eric  Eric  yes  where have you been  out of your meeting  am I out of your meeting  no  are you out of your meeting  yeah  and listen  I hate to be the technical guy  but it's like  I can barely hear you guys  so why would somebody  check the phone  why would somebody  on hold for 15 minutes  why would somebody  check the level  so I could actually  hear the audio  coming to me  but in the end  you're to blame  you're like the big guy  you're at the top  of the pyramid  my friend  you should be 
[03:13:00]  firing people  you're working  you're transmitting  you're now getting paid  finally  so my work here  is done  I would assume  somebody in that room  would say hey  let's make sure  the audio feeds  down the phone  so regardless  who's on the phone  they can hear  he makes a valid point  whose responsibility  is it ELO  whose responsibility  is it  well I don't think  it's mine  and I don't think  it's the three  hosts of the show  outside of that  we can start  with Carleese  and start beating  downward  wow  who would you fire  if you  for this offense  for this offense  I start with  pulses 
[03:13:30]  and work up  pulses  he's just looking  for a live body  oh ok  now we need  an ELO  first of all  how are you  I'm great  how are you  Jimmy  good  are you losing  your mind  with this whole  merger thing  no my mind  has been lost  a long time ago  I know you  have to talk  very vague here  but what could  you say today  Eric  I can say  that the future  is as clear  as it has been  for the past  475 days  oh wow  oh boy  so in other words 
[03:14:00]  no new news  Eric  I'm just stating  I just think  we're in the same  place we have been  we're continuing  to demonstrate  how this merger  is in the best  interest of the public  and why there's  terrific benefits  to the subscribers  of both platforms  and even new  subscribers  and we're going  to continue  to demonstrate  that and hopefully  win the support  of the FCC  are there terrific  benefits for  Eric Logan  well that is  a whole different  question now  isn't it  yes  what's your hunch  what's my hunch 
[03:14:30]  yeah  I've learned  after this past  year and a half  not to have hunches  oh boy  he talks like  that guy  on Wall Street  the old guy  that talks  very vague  and you have to  try to figure out  what he's saying  yeah he used to be  what's his name  we forgot him  Greenspan  Greenspan  oh Greenspan  Alan Greenspan  you're speaking  like Alan Greenspan  who did he marry  he married some  political  Andrea Kramer  is that right  really  he married somebody  I don't remember  we were asking too  Hilo  we wanted to ask you  because we were  having an issue  with we had 
[03:15:00]  Steve in studio  giving him a bit  of a razin  and the staff  had some things  they wanted to  chit chat about  and well we know  that young Danny  is occasionally  a mouthy sociopath  but  but very valuable  to the Opie and Anthony  yes  and when asking  on the air  he's concerned  and we want  to be rest assured  that if we're asking  him things on the air  for the show  he's allowed to answer  honestly  as long as it's not  being carried off there  yeah  is he allowed  to speak openly  Eric Logan  of course he's allowed  to speak openly 
[03:15:30]  I guess my question  to him would be  what makes him believe  he shouldn't  or can't  ah  what do you got  there Danny  well  just from prior  experience  that's all  there have been  times where  things have come  up on the air  and then I would  get a talking to  off the air  about things  that happened  on the air  so I've  give me an example  on the air  man  like  remember the whole  the whole post  stuff  from  yeah  remember 
[03:16:00]  like when he  did his  his show  and there was  some  why do you get  in trouble for that  why do you get  in trouble for  Poe's show  well no no  because me and  Steve had gotten  into a disagreement  on the air  about what  I don't remember  to be totally  honest with you  Danny  whatever because  Poe decided  he was going  to have a big  party here  that night  yeah  are you sure  the issue  wasn't the fact  that it was  the big party  or the fact  that you talked  about it on the air  because it sounds  like a big party  in the studio  would be where  I'd have the problem  well you should  have had the problem  with Poe's guests  that were convicts  that weren't 
[03:16:30]  checked out properly  well that's a  different issue  I think the way  I think the way  it had worked  was that I had  alerted Steve  I had heard from  a third party  like I was like  out I think  being social  three parties  yeah and I heard  from somebody  like oh I heard  there's a lot of  people going to  the studio tomorrow  and I was like  really  so I shot Steve  an email just  saying you might  want to check  into this  I think that  there's a bunch  of people  showing up tomorrow  and he had  asked or whatever  but then Steve  was trying to tell  me like he said  well you knew  that there were  people coming in  and I'm like yeah  but only because  I told you  and it got into 
[03:17:00]  this big argument  it sounds to me  Danny that you  were doing the  right thing as a  good corporate  soldier making  sure that the  interests of the  company were being  protected so for  that I salute you  I thought so but  then when it came  up on the air it  turned into a big  argument and you  know I was I was  wrong and you  know the the more  senior parties won  out more senior  parties where did  the seniority stop  I'm sorry Don  Wicklin Don  Wicklin well now  now we know  Steve is here as 
[03:17:30]  well so I  Steve should  definitely weigh in  I vaguely remember  I vaguely remember  what what Danny's  talking about I  remember the  Poe incident I  don't remember the  details I remember  clearly okay that's  where we got that  clip from where you  told me to I  believe the quote  was you shut the  fuck up for two  seconds I love that  one well by the way  that's not the first  time you've heard  that quote so let's  get that out of the  way and not just  from Steve correct  here's it usually on  bars there was  some other  fuck up for two 
[03:18:00]  seconds but there  was there's been  multiple there's been  some other occasions  too I could recall  there's a lot of  hate in this room  Eric what do you  have to say about  that yeah are you  asking me yeah  oh I didn't I  you're asking me if  there's what about  the hate in the room  there's a lot of  hate in this room  probably a lot of  hate where he is  right now I was  gonna say I mean I  guess why should that  be regulated your  room yeah so but  but Danny wouldn't  be in trouble if  if it was something 
[03:18:30]  we were asking him  for opinions on the  air well as long as  he's not disfaining  somebody or as long  as he's not alleging  certain things that he  could be liable or  slanderous for  well what if it's all  in you know good  natured ribbing like  we say Steve is a  homosexual  well that's but what  that's that teeters on  fact or fiction  but that's  teeters  thanks Eric I really  appreciate that  see the deposition  I'm here for you Steve  yes I know  I don't even I don't  even tease Steve  where would Don 
[03:19:00]  Wickland be on that  seesaw  oh my god please  he'd be on the  seaside of the saw  he'd be able to sit  on the  seesaw in the clouds  yeah right in the  middle you know that  little thing ribs up in  the middle  yeah  he'd be able to sit  on the seesaw without  hands  oh  yeah  oh come on  reminds me of the  crime scene discussion  from yesterday morning  oh you heard that  oh yeah  how could I  listen I look forward  to the Jillini  update  that is the highlight 
[03:19:30]  of my day  or Anthelini  whichever  whichever  no I call Jillini  I know you say it's  Anthelini I think it's  Jillini because it's  really all about Jill  yeah  hold on Sam  Sam made a face  Sam did you want to  correct Elo  because I figured  in the same tone  as the face  you might want to  correct Eric  no because somebody  said something in my  headphones I was  making a face at that  oh because  what happened  when you said  Jillini  yeah  Sam made a face  like like like  a what the fuck  like what a dummy  that kind of face  and I was like  what is that  you know what it was 
[03:20:00]  who still is in charge  oh yeah he's the boss  no I know that  because Bob the intern  said something in my  headphones  hey Bob  what do you call  this thing  what do you call  boop sight  party for you  let's get Bob in  and ask him  hey hey Bob  where's Bob  oh this is a brand new  intern here  hey Bob  his name is Bob  he's straight from  Liverpool  he's a wonderful  little lad  with rosy red cheeks  he's got a complexion 
[03:20:30]  looks like he's right  off the boat  from England  talk to Eric Logan  yeah what'd you say  Bob  why would that mic work  why would the mic work  I'm so glad this has  happened in front of  Eric Logan  Steve bash some heads  will ya  yes you know  I can't remember  when I've ever had an  intern that lasted  more in a week  with a British accent  yeah  yeah Bob  yeah I assure you  I could not have said  anything to Sam  because I was nowhere  near a microphone  we don't understand  what you're saying  what  yeah 
[03:21:00]  I was nowhere near a microphone  nope  still not quite it  you're English  remember  we don't quite understand you  hey  I'll sit  hey you got to turn southern  that's from fucking  from London Arkansas  look at his car crashing you  now  Bob  I'll be like your English  I  I'm  telling you  I  I was 
[03:21:30]  come on give it a shot  you're almost there  this is Forrest Gump of Wales  go ahead  what were you doing there Bob  I was  come on this is Eric Logan  on the phone  yeah really man  he can  steal you sir  I was  nowhere near  don't worry  don't worry  I'm sure  my time talking to an intern  is probably the most efficient 
[03:22:00]  use of my time today  clearly there's nothing else  I should be focusing on right now  than an intern  trying to do an English accent  of course  let's say goodbye to Bob  goodbye Bob  I will catch you later  Bob  we'll see you at the pub  alright then  cheerio  fucking  that's my new  favorite bit  Bob  he's awful  just  come up with excuses  why we have to bring him back  it's a different accent  every time  does he have the same sort of smell 
[03:22:30]  that I had to listen to the 15 minutes  I could barely heal  because somebody didn't check the audio  swamp ass  oh yeah  we didn't isolate that  we don't know what it is  yeah  someone has diarrhea  well  you know again  that's what pre-show is for  oh  Mars  get Mars in here  he's blaming Mars  okay Mars  Mars should have done his  I don't know whose fault it is  I'm thinking  you guys  literally  it sounds like you guys  could be yelling down the street  and I could get a better connection  I'm thinking the show itself  has actually developed a smell 
[03:23:00]  and it's just shit  Mars  Eric Logan's saying  that you should have checked  the equipment better  before we got here today  what do you have to say about that  speed of the audio  down the phone line  yeah if I do that  you're going to get that garble  that we had a problem with before  okay  right now we're at the optimum level  so that's great  so what you're telling me  is I have hearing loss  he called you stupid  pretty much  yeah  so I'm the dummy  yeah  Mars just called you stupid 
[03:23:30]  is pretty much what he did  I don't recall those words  coming out of my mouth  fine  he sounds a bit tense  he's probably in his office  nude  with a handgun  I can only hope  no no  I'm going to  I'm going to closet  with a guy named Peter Cook  and I don't know what he's doing  here on Paltosh  hey that's good  Logan what's up  with the merger  come on  give us something  that'll give us  a nice headline today  a nice headline today

[03:34:00]  what  there's been a  theme to this  side of the  shoulder  that's right  it's not  improv  Tuesday  Tuesday  Tuesday  all right  fam  good job  tell you  we never got  our Vince  McMahon update  Sam  oh fuck  what happened  I mean we 
[03:34:30]  could do it  or we could  you know  get subscriptions  up and say  tomorrow we'll do  it  that's something  we should say  for 720  Elo gave us  permission to  leave  that's right  you heard it  wait kidding me  the magic that  we're producing  Elo might want  a McMahon update  though  wow  Vince McMahon  so the fake  the fake hurt  he did  well we have to  go back  done this one  accident  he pulled on  everyone  go back a little  because it's not  a ruse he got  hurt  yeah a big  thing fell on him  well he was in  the safe place 
[03:35:00]  as the big thing  fell on him  of course he was  he couldn't look  like it fell on him  he said he couldn't  feel his legs  yeah well  Vicky Guerrero  came out with this  good evening  last Monday night  on Raw  there was a  terrible  and unfortunate  accident  which resulted  in the chairman  of World  what the fuck  is Vince doing  to these wrestlers  that's Vicky  what are they  eating like  steroids  like they're M&M's  listen to his voice 
[03:35:30]  that's not a  that's Eddie Guerrero's  widow  oh I thought it was a guy  no that's Vicky  Vicky is a girl's name  oh wow  and that's Eddie  Guerrero's widow  she's the Smackdown  general manager  Wrestling Entertainment  she's upset  what do they give her  that job so she  doesn't sue the shit  out of Vince McMahon  I think that she  earned it  Mr. McMahon  being severely injured  get back  what happened there  they showed  the sound bite  yeah  oh okay  that's 
[03:36:00]  yeah exactly  severely injured  that's the reaction  I was hoping for  yeah  complete emptiness  yes  on behalf of my  family  I would like to  extend our well wishes  thoughts and prayers  to Mr. McMahon  and his family  yeah  Mr. McMahon  I sincerely hope  that you are not  confined  to a wheelchair  like this  just like I am 
[03:36:30]  for the rest of your  she's in a wheelchair  yeah because like  why is she in a wheelchair  she got in the ring  in December  yeah  Undertaker tombstoned her  yeah  oh shit  and she ended up  in a wheelchair  since December  oh shit  and the Undertaker  is still working  well actually no  because the Undertaker  lost a title  versus career match  to Edge  why wouldn't the Undertaker  be in jail  for paralyzing somebody  it's all in the name  of wrestling  it's in the contracts  yeah  yeah  Mr. McMahon 
[03:37:00]  you are my  champion  and everyone  here on Smackdown  wishes you  a speedy  recovery  so basically  that was a waste  of time  by this  well  Vicky Guerrero  no  we are nothing  of the extent  of the injuries  well this is  it's just because  no news had come out  then Shane McMahon  the following Monday  came out to say  oh here's the update  we have some  Shane O'Mac audio  Shane O'Mac  is a guy who's  gonna know  okay  yeah  yeah 
[03:37:30]  it's his son  well of course  I heard an interesting  fact about the  McMahon family  what  Jimmy  from somebody  who had breakfast  with him  who got to have  breakfast with them  I don't want to say  but he said that  what he remembers  was the smell of ketchup  was overwhelming  because apparently  they're ketchup  obsessed  ketchup is  one of the best  condiments  he said their eggs  were swimming  in ketchup  really  yeah  fascinating  can't wait to bring  Bulb back in 
[03:38:00]  Bulb  he's gonna come in  one more time  all right  all right  so Shane O'Mac  not yet  Bulb  oh there's Bulb  Bulb you're coming  too early  I was fucking  Bulb  they're just  taunting him  whenever you see  Bob out there  just you know  do your thing  guys  audience participation  is pretty important  today  for the British  thing  I don't know  if this Shane O'Mac 
[03:38:30]  okay we got it  working  good evening  hi  most of you know  that my father  was victim of a  horrendous accident  you also know him  as the colorful  and somewhat  boisterous  good to see that  Shane O'Mac  got acting lessons  this last time  we played a clip  of his on our show  he's not acting  he's WWE chairman  but in reality  he's a very private  person  and respecting  his privacy  tonight we will not  be forthcoming  with his physical  condition  what  but in the interim  I ask that all 
[03:39:00]  raw superstars  WWE employees  production crew  referees  trainers  anybody involved  with tonight's  production  pull together  in this time  of uncertainty  what  thank you  they're laughing  Sam  no I was crying  the audience is laughing  I was crying  I heard a thing  sometimes you gotta  mask that sadness  with a laugh  and I heard booing  when he said he  wasn't gonna  be forthright 
[03:39:30]  with his condition  I hope he rolls  out as just a head  what  oh that'd be great  somehow they figured  out how to keep him  alive as just a head  I hope so  if that's what it  comes down to  but I hope he  makes a full recovery  he's gonna be in a  wheelchair  a rickety old  wheelchair  I hope it's one of  those old old  wooden wheelchairs  with an afghan  yeah with an afghan  over his legs  and some kind of  cane stick  that he can bang  yeah  yes  Bedelia  where's my cake 
[03:40:00]  Bedelia  you bitch  fucking love that one  Creepshow  again  another one  I gotta see  oh you gotta get  Creepshow  found a friend  Harry  I know that one's  from Creepshow  yeah  Adrian Barbeau  is in that one  Adrian Barbeau  yeah Mr. Pratt  you have to hit  all the stories  yeah  people uh  in the service  industry  you know  people of color  like yourself  I want my cake 
[03:40:30]  and Jordy  Jordy Verrill  you lunkhead  always in it  always bad  I'll take it up  the college  that's the ticket  um  and Stephanie  was on last night  because now  you're at a point  where the inmates  are running the asylum  without Vince McMahon  on Raw  oh shit  and the general manager  William Regal  lost a pink slip match  weeks ago 
[03:41:00]  so there's no general manager  so when does he come back  Vince  where's the loophole  where he comes back  it was so weird  after he  right like the day  after he lost  the pink slip match  it was announced  he was suspended  for 60 days  because of a drug policy  so I don't know  when he's coming back  uncertain as to  who the fucking  uh  CEO is  right  uh  also no GM  no GM  it sounds like K-Rock  what  so what  you think  that he had  a 60 days  of drug policy  suspension  I don't think  well they announced  it on the website  the day after 
[03:41:30]  he lost his  pink slip match  which is such like  to have that much  bad stuff  happening all at once  no see  they  worked it into the show  see he had to go away  for  the drug thing  for 60 days  so they said  alright we'll make  this a work  what  yeah that's what  they do  pink slips  aren't 60 days though  well they figure  what the hell  just get rid of him  for 60 days  and then there'll be  some loophole  that brings him back  and you'll buy  into that one too  well  that remains to be seen 
[03:42:00]  Stephanie with the  Vince McMahon update  that we've been  waiting weeks for  Stephanie  last week  my brother Shane  asked for all  raw superstars  to pull together  in this time  of uncertainty  and what resulted  was a show in chaos  with my father  still incapacitated  it is more vital  than ever  for all of you  to work together  therefore on behalf  of my father  my brother  my entire family  I implore you  and my bank accounts  what  and my bank accounts  what happened  there was chaos  well yeah 
[03:42:30]  this is what's  going to happen  because plus  the draft  had just happened  so there's all kinds  of new superstars  on raw  they do drafts  now on  well because  since the brand  extension  you know  wrestlers have to  get drafted  to certain brands  Jimmy's  just want to let  the audience  in on something  Jimmy has just  been standing  this whole time  staring at young  Sam  and just farting  the whole fucking  time  I thought it was  coincidence  he's just farting  over and over again  my body is speaking 
[03:43:00]  for the audience  my brother  my entire family  I implore you  WWE superstars  trainers  production crew  referees  announcers  to please  all work  as one  well we still  don't have an update  Sam  how many weeks  are they going to  you know  string us along here  well I feel like  they've kind of said  look Vince McMahon  is a private person  so let's try to go on  with the show  and now it's more  the focus is on  let's act like adults 
[03:43:30]  let's try to find  if there's no leader  let's work together  adults  you know  yeah  and I mean  last night was no better  it was chaos again  even after that announcement  yeah what happened  oh my goodness  was it  well I mean  crime time  and John Cena  smashed up JBL's limo  I mean  no  yes  there was  you know  four guys  couldn't agree  on who's the number  one contender  is it Kane  is it JBL  is it John Cena  I don't know 
[03:44:00]  I guess Bob's  I guess Bob's  walking through  so basically  it's been in  yeah  every time Bob  you poofed  every time  Bob appears  they're just  driving him nuts  you can't walk  around out there  go ahead Sam  and then after Kane  loses the number  one contendership  he snaps  these wildfires  in Santa Barbara  are getting out  of control  oh yeah I know  he's insane  going off like 
[03:44:30]  a wildfire  Hurricane Bertha  is getting closer  to  that's not a wrestler  what  Hurricane Bertha  Bermuda  no and then  I mean  CM Punk  is the world champion  now  $141 a barrel  which nobody saw  coming  what  for oil  you know  I'm so sick  of the price  just going up  all the time  and JBL  is trying to say  that he should  control the company  I'm actually cold  with that fucking  idiot spilled water  on me 
[03:45:00]  I'm chilly  is that what  it's making you  fart  and then you got  the gasoline  it's still at a  record high  of around $4.11  a gallon  JBL's the richest  of all the wrestlers  that's expensive  everything he's done  JBL  yeah in the stock market  they defend Jews  no  John Branch  the wrestling stinks  what  what do you  no it doesn't  when are we looking  at it possibly  I would  when are we  pitching her  for when  who  he's toast to pitch  Adrian Barbell  I'm up in the air
