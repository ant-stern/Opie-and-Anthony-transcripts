<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, largely revolving around the aftermath of Super Bowl XLII and internal workplace conflicts.  The show began with a boisterous celebration of the Giants' upset victory over the Patriots, featuring numerous calls from both New York and Boston fans, many laced with profanity.  Opie and Anthony, along with Bob Kelly, dissected the game extensively, mocking Opie's pre-game prediction of a Patriots win and Eli Manning "shitting his pants."  Kelly displayed an overt man-crush on Tom Brady, while the hosts and callers speculated on Brady's performance,  Gisele Bündchen's influence, and Bill Belichick's post-game demeanor.  The segment also included commentary on Super Bowl commercials, particularly the Panda Express and "Bada Bling" ads, the latter sparking a discussion with Stella Grillo, representing an Italian-American organization protesting the commercial's stereotypical portrayal of Italian-Americans.  Grillo engaged in a phone interview, debating the hosts on the issue.  A crying Patriots fan from a local Boston news clip also provided comedic fodder.  The hosts further discussed the NFL's practice of donating unused championship apparel to third-world countries and a running gag based on Robert De Niro impressions.  There was confusion regarding whether Terry Bradshaw used profanity during the pre-game show, later determined to be the phrase "bucket head."  A caller parodied a Super Bowl song.

The show then transitioned to a humorous "Black History Month" segment, featuring absurd fictional African-American heroes, interspersed with mockery of a caller named Steve from Bayshore.  This was followed by a graphic and humorous discussion of the Brock Lesnar vs. Frank Mir UFC fight, punctuated by numerous caller opinions and a despondent, emotionally distraught Bob Kelly, whose despair over the Patriots' loss became a recurring comedic element, leading to discussions about Gisele Bündchen and Tom Brady.  The hosts also briefly discussed a bet resulting in one of them spending a night with Lily from the Ron and Fez show, with sexually suggestive banter ensuing. The segment ended with a darkly comedic discussion of a news story involving mentally challenged women used as unwitting suicide bombers in Iraq, again eliciting caller commentary.

The show continued with a discussion about a truck driver unwittingly involved in a bombing, followed by numerous offensive listener calls targeting various groups. This led to a discussion of Cooper Manning's career and spinal stenosis, further punctuated by offensive commentary. The hosts then attempted an interview with Donna D’Erico, a Baywatch actress and Ron Paul supporter, which was repeatedly disrupted by technical difficulties and offensive caller commentary, including threats and insults directed at D’Erico.  The discussion covered Ron Paul's political stances on abortion, gay marriage, states' rights, and the Iraq War, featuring heated debates and offensive language from callers.  The segment also included a recounting of a physical altercation and discussion of Joran Van Der Sloot's alleged involvement in a murder.

The show's final segments focused on internal workplace conflicts. One segment centered on Danny's alleged hangover and subsequent "sick day" following the Super Bowl, leading to a contentious phone call with Danny and a harsh critique of Bob Kelly's CD promotion.  A political discussion with a guest favoring Hillary Clinton over John McCain was also included.  A significant portion of the show focused on Eric's chronic lateness and ensuing heated argument with the hosts, involving accusations of wasting time and complaints from other staff.  This argument included hints of further conflict and a suggestion of an anonymous workplace grievance vote.

The final segment detailed E-Rock's tardiness and resentment over a past promotion. This discussion involved speculation about a possibly undisclosed sexual harassment incident and frank, vulgar discussions among the hosts, E-Rock, and other staff regarding workplace issues and potential solutions, including a “blockbuster trade” with Ron and Fez.  E-Rock's poor time management was a recurring theme, with suggestions ranging from fines to calorie restrictions.  The segment included tangents about Danny's behavior, a listener's comment about a toilet, and a "likability" rating of the staff (10 being "punch in the face").  The segment concluded with ongoing discussions about personnel trades and plans for the next day’s show.

[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  F-U-R-A-V-U!  We ain't you!  Take this, you mother of God!  Fuck the way!  Drop them, drop them.  I'm coming around again.  This is where entertainment is going.  What?  No, man!  Oh, yeah! 
[00:01:00]  Yeah!  We are sick.  Freak!  Woo!  Yeah!  We'll be back on the grind in a few minutes, man.  We are outing.  Missing a big pass.  Woo!  You guys are the reason that just crap radio.  Someone's home going, if they can do this, so can I.  Okay?  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the roll.  So, let me get this straight. 
[00:01:30]  Eli Manning just won a Super Bowl.  Yeah.  Holy mother of God.  That's pretty much it.  Holy mother of God.  Yep.  He's got the ring.  Did it.  What a, what a, exciting game.  Got a little slow.  A lot of, uh, it did get a little slow at the, right after the beginning. 
[00:02:00]  Up until about, you know, it was a lot of defense in there.  It was slow, but because it was a case that was being shut down, it kept me interested because  it was such a great offense.  And I just want to quote Obi, go Pats, go.  I do like the fact that every time they went to sack Brady, they really just pushed his  face into the ground.  At one point, I saw somebody just twisting his ankle under the pile and just like twisting 
[00:02:30]  it like a steering wheel.  Yeah.  Brady's not used to getting hit like that.  What was it?  Five sacks?  And hard ones, man.  They were pounding him.  I mean, everyone's going to be talking about Eli Manning and that final drive, but the Giants  defense won that Super Bowl for them, big time.  They played it amazing.  The defense was amazing.  Unbelievable.  Look at these phones.  Oh my God.  No one has gone to bed yet.  Tom Brady looked scared at one point.  He didn't look right.  He looked, was that, and can some, maybe one of the listeners can correct me. 
[00:03:00]  Was that Giselle's first appearance at a game?  Oh boy.  I had heard that she had never gone to one of his games before, and then someone at  Oak's house, I went to Oak's house, I said, no, no, no, she's at every game.  But I'm like, no, I don't think she's at every game.  I don't think she goes to every game.  No way.  Oh boy.  That was the first time I remember seeing her in the stands like that.  So she has been going to games, man.  She's well hidden.  Brady just didn't look right.  Maybe that ankle injury was something.  I thought it was like just a little possum they were playing, but he just seemed off. 
[00:03:30]  But he also got hit so many times, he was probably a bit dazed by the end of that game.  Well, the phones are just freaking lit.  Let's say hi to Phil and Bashar.  Phil, what's up?  Yo.  What's up?  What's up, Phil?  I just wanted to let you know that when that sports curse really counts, you really pull  through for us, Oak.  Go Pats!  All year long I was saying, go Pats, go.  I was feeling good about myself. 
[00:04:00]  The freaking, I just knew the sports curse was leading to something.  I just knew it.  It was hiding for a little while.  Yeah.  Hiding?  This is like the biggest sports curse ever.  Went into remission and then it came out big.  Let's say hi to Nick.  What's up, Nick?  Nick?  Hey, what's up, Paul?  Hey.  Listen, man.  I love you on the radio, but I'm begging you on behalf of Boston.  Never root for us again.  We don't want you.  Good.  With 2.42 left, Brady scored and I figured that's it. 
[00:04:30]  This is why the Patriots are unbeatable.  And then Eli Manning right there was in the grasp.  That was a call the Giants got lucky with.  He was in the grasp.  1.08 left.  And that man who caught the ball on his head.  Who was it?  Tyree.  Caught the ball on his head.  No, that was probably one of the most amazing catches, well, certainly in the Super Bowl ever.  Yep.  Yeah.  I mean, the guy caught, David Tyree catches it going backwards on his one hand.  Over his head.  Pushes it down to his helmet and falls backwards and is able to make sure he doesn't drop the ball. 
[00:05:00]  At that point, you just knew the Giants were going to win.  Yeah, they had to.  After a catch like that, you just don't lose the game.  It's like, now you've got to win because that was one of the hugest plays.  He was done.  First of all, yeah, Manning was sacked.  He should have been, it was over.  You were watching that and just going, oh my God, he's got guys all over him.  And then he breaks loose of that, fires that pass off.  It's amazing.  After the pass scored, it was like 2.40 left. 
[00:05:30]  I saw Strahan, they went to Strahan on the sidelines, just pumping everyone up.  I'm like, what is he doing?  It's over.  You know, he knew a little more than I, certainly.  And then they came down and just, wow.  Wow.  Destroyed.  Let's go to Ian in New York.  Ian, what's up?  Toby, I just wanted to thank you for endorsing the Patriots this season.  I don't know when the last time it was that they scored that few points.  Well, you've got to give the credit to the Giants defense, man. 
[00:06:00]  They were unbelievable.  We were just thinking.  Unbelievable.  We were talking yesterday about how cocky the Patriots, I mean, the Patriots weren't that cocky,  but Tom Brady, what, they only think we're going to score 17 points?  Gee, thanks.  Like, what a spit in the face of the Giants defense that was to come out with that quote.  Yeah.  Gave him too much credit.  Yep.  Let's keep going on the phones for a little bit here.  Mark in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, okay.  Hey, on behalf of me, New York, and New Jersey, thank you for taking the Pats.  See, I thought we buried this whole sports curse thing, but I guess not. 
[00:06:30]  Nope.  Because that's all everyone is saying right now on the phone lines.  Still there.  Just do me a favor.  Find a new hockey team, for God's sakes.  Why?  You're an Islander fan?  Oh, yeah.  Well, here we go.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Well, this is from Friday.  We got a little taste audio.  You got that, E-Rock?  All right.  This is my prediction from Friday.  By the way, let it be known that the Super Bowl is not even going to be close.  It's all cute that it's been hyped up for the last two weeks.  The Patriots are going to destroy the Giants. 
[00:07:00]  Eli Manning is going to get on that field in Arizona, and he's going to S his pants.  He seems pretty confident in his interviews.  It's so different when you're playing the Super Bowl than any other game, obviously.  He's going to walk out onto that field and realize this is completely foreign to him,  and he's just going to lose his mind.  I couldn't be...  And we're back live.  I couldn't be more wrong.  You couldn't try to be more wrong than that clip we just played.  Everything about that clip was wrong. 
[00:07:30]  Eli looked confident.  Sure.  He didn't S his pants.  No, he did not.  And he, you know, got that final drive together.  Led his team to victory.  Takes home the MVP.  Takes home the MVP.  He really...  Now he's got something in common with his brother.  Yep.  His brother won the MVP last year.  We all remember, right?  Amazing.  Another clip from Friday, the last one.  Going back to Friday's show. 
[00:08:00]  Dan's predicting, what, three interceptions?  I don't think it's going to be close whatsoever.  No.  Brady's done, what, three Super Bowls now, right?  Oh, he can walk out there and notice everything.  It's got to be nerve-wracking, but when you're doing it for the first time,  when Eli Manning walks out onto that field and realizes there's billions of people watching,  he's going to S his pants.  And they're watching you.  Yeah.  I don't...  For the most part, all eyes on you.  Right.  Which is just completely nerve-wracking, even if you've been there a few times.  But for the first time, it's going to be so foreign to him that I'm telling you, 
[00:08:30]  it's not even going to be close.  Oh, my God.  Oh, did you have that wrong?  Oh, my God.  Let's say hi to Chris in Boston.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, I'm actually from Boston.  I just wanted to call and congratulate you guys as a fan of not only the Patriots and just the football.  You guys played a hell of a game last night.  Yeah, we did.  Right?  I'm still feeling it a little, though.  I'm achy.  Yeah, I'm a little sore, too. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, a little sore.  It's funny.  I'm not a Giants fan at all.  I hate the Giants, but I was really rooting for them yesterday.  It was funny.  I was...  Yeah.  Have a good one, guys.  All right.  Thank you, man.  It was pretty much me and Travis rooting for the Pats at my house.  That was it.  That was it.  I thought I would get a few more on my side, but that was it.  Unbelievable.  Let's go to Tommy in New York.  Tommy, don't you guys sleep?  What's up?  Tommy.  No, for my party, man.  Opie, thank you.  On behalf of everybody in New York, F. Boston, F. the Patriots, and F. Bob Kelly, and his 
[00:09:30]  man crush on F. Tom Brady.  Oh, he must have been in tears.  They can all go to hell.  Go, Pat.  Go, Giants.  Pats suck.  All right.  There you go.  Thank you.  All I was thinking of yesterday is how bad I wanted to slap Bob's face.  Oh, I know.  Every time they showed Brady, I just wanted to reach in and smack Bob in the face.  Look, as much as I wanted the Pats to win the Super Bowl, as soon as that game was over, 
[00:10:00]  Jimmy and I both pushed send to Bob Kelly.  We had our taxes ready to go.  Let's go to Sonny Ferelli from Boston, listening on BCN.  What's up, Sonny?  Hey, what's happening?  Hey, listen, no excuses, no curse, no nothing like that.  Plain and simple, the New York Giants played a better game than the New England Patriots did.  Do me a favor, Sonny.  We all know that.  Don't try to take the high road.  No, no, no.  Everybody's making excuses about Brady's foot, Brady's foot, Brady's foot, you know? 
[00:10:30]  Well, Sonny, you just heard the New York fans.  I mean, what are you going to do?  Are you going to let them get the best of you there?  No, no, no.  But let's say it this way.  The pass rush and the Giants' defense were just absolutely incredible.  I mean, I'll tell you what, when the Patriots scored that touchdown in two minutes,  you know, two and 30 seconds, whatever, whatever,  I kind of knew that Eli Manning was going to come back for the win, you know?  It was just one of those weird games where, like, the momentum finally shifted to the Pats, 
[00:11:00]  and then I looked at Jimmy and I'm like, man, you guys are in deep trouble.  But then when Eli started that drive, you're like, oh, my God, I think he's going to do this.  You just got a feeling that he was coming back to freaking do that.  Once he got that miracle pass off, that was it.  Tom Brady just never got into the rhythm at all throughout the whole game.  Just never got into the rhythm.  You know what, though?  He's not used to having that much pressure.  The Giants were all over him all game.  What was it once again?  Five sacks?  Yeah.  I think that's the most sacks he had this year, right? 
[00:11:30]  There was one sack, I don't even know who the hell did it,  but he put all of his weight on Brady's body when he sent them to the grass,  and just he made a point of lifting his legs up and his arms up,  so his entire body weight slammed down on Brady.  It was amazing.  There was one sack where somebody fumbled forth the fumble on the ball there  and wrenched his arm.  Yeah.  Oh, they were pulling at him.  They were pulling at his arms, his legs. 
[00:12:00]  Just trying to make him hurt.  Oh, just a bunch of...  And it was effective.  That would be Brady.  Just a bunch of animals getting to that supermodel Tom Brady,  as Bob Kelly calls him.  I don't think...  I don't think Tom...  I was sitting next to Lindsey's father,  and I said, there was one point two plays in a row.  I said, I don't think he has gone down two plays in a row all year, right?  I mean, I think probably he has, but I don't know.  Very rare.  Too hard sacks.  And you know what I was thinking of? 
[00:12:30]  Huh?  Oh, you got me?  Thinking what?  Oh, maybe you got you.  Hey, you got me.  Whatever.  Let's go to Brooklyn.  Purnell, what's up?  Opie, thank you, my man.  I made $50.  I love you, man.  Well, take that $50 and get a better phone, all right?  Really?  What are you talking out about, a football phone?  Oh.  All right, Purnell.  Let's go to John on Long Island.  John.  Hey, John.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hey, what's up, man? 
[00:13:00]  Opie, thank you.  Thank you very much.  Why is there like...  I love that sports curse.  I really thought the sports curse wasn't going to be a factor this morning, that we could  just talk about the game.  Oh, huge.  The instant feedback's going nuts.  I knew it was just too good to be true that I'm finally rooting for a winner like I was  all year long.  It was guaranteed, wasn't it?  And by the way, yeah.  And by the way, the sports curse all started with the Super Bowl.  Like, when I was working in Buffalo, I was up there for three out of the four losses. 
[00:13:30]  And then we were up in Boston when the Pats lost the Super Bowl.  And then we came back down here, and the Giants lost the Super Bowl.  It's pretty much wherever...  It's just amazing.  I can't tell you the last time I picked a Super Bowl winner that I cared about.  Some of these games, you're like, ah, I'll just take the Broncos, whatever.  But in general, when I really, really feel it, I cannot pick a winner.  The Patriots are obviously a great team.  But they beat the Rams, I think, on the last play.  I didn't realize how close their Super Bowls were. 
[00:14:00]  They're not the...  I hate to tell people, but they're not the Steelers of the 70s or the 49ers or the 80s.  They're great.  Why are you rubbing it in now?  Dude, I'm really not.  Why are you rubbing it in?  18-1, good record.  Why are you rubbing it in?  It's that one.  18's a lot of wins.  It's like if they got that one on game, you know, 14.  Hey, look, they...  You know what?  Went and won the Super Bowl.  You got to blame Mayor Menino.  Yes.  We're being hurt on BCN in Boston right now. 
[00:14:30]  You got to blame the mayor.  Yep.  You know, he's getting a parade together and all this stuff.  The Victory Parade will make its way to Boston.  We're starting to be on.  Be on.  You got to blame the mayor.  He was the one.  He jinxed you.  And the team for trying to copyright 19-0.  They wanted to copyright that.  He tried to copyright it and some dude...  Who owns it?  Just some dude got the copyright a few years back. 
[00:15:00]  I forgot what team was undefeated for a while.  And the guy looked ahead and he copyrighted.  Copy wrote 19-0.  I was reading over the weekend.  I can't remember right now.  Anyway, here's the highlight.  Manning lobs it.  Burris alone.  Touchdown, New York.  There you go.  It's almost like being there.  And the New York Giants, one second away from pulling off this upset. 
[00:15:30]  Eli Manning, 19 of 34, 255 yards, two touchdowns.  One to Tyree, one to Burris, one interception.  Toomer, six catches.  The Giants defense, five sacks.  The Giants have won the Super Bowl.  I think you should have went with a Hail Mary.  One second left.  We're throwing it up in the air, let them catch it.  Just throw it up in the air. 
[00:16:00]  That last draw was questionable.  It was questionable, by the way, throwing three bombs like that.  I thought he had enough time to kind of march down a little bit.  They had, what, two or three timeouts?  Yeah.  It was really questionable to just go all out.  I think three long passes in a row, right?  It looked a little desperate.  Yeah, it really did.  And he got sacked badly.  I've never seen anybody sacked more efficiently than Brady got in that last draw.  It was like a moving wall that hit Brady.  Yeah.  I know which one.  I forgot the guy's name. 
[00:16:30]  It was like the last, but it was almost like they just cradled him.  He couldn't even, he just was hugged.  He was hugged and he fell down.  Right, right.  It's like me on a date.  And then Belichick just walks off the field.  Yeah.  They're going to be talking about that for a while.  I mean, there were.  He left with two seconds left.  Well, he hugged the Giants coach first.  He did say congratulations, though.  Yeah, but then technically there's still two seconds left on the clock.  I know a lot of people were on the field, but he just walks off like that.  And then they had to clear the field out so the Giants could take a knee, you know. 
[00:17:00]  But I don't know.  That seems a little.  Well, then they talked to Belichick.  Like most of us, I guess, turned off our TVs at this point.  But they talked to Belichick outside the locker room.  And, of course, you got to get.  Who was it?  Chris Meyer.  And you had to get the Chris Meyer whispering.  Because it's a very.  Oh, it was the somber.  Yeah.  So, coach.  What went wrong?  And it's obvious by listening to these two quick Belichick clips that the NFL makes you. 
[00:17:30]  It's part of the contract, obviously.  After the game, win or lose, we want you to talk to the media.  You have to.  You have to.  Because what Belichick said, there's no way he would have done that on his own.  No.  Thank you very much.  We're outside the Patriot.  Thank you.  We're outside.  Thank you very much.  It's not like, thank you very much.  Here we are.  Oh, my God.  The victory.  Thank you very much.  We're outside the Patriot's mausoleum.  Right.  We're at the funeral home.  Thoughts and prayers. 
[00:18:00]  Thoughts and prayers.  The body is inside.  Going to get a few words from the participants of the wake.  Thank you very much.  We're outside the Patriot locker room with Coach Bill Belichick.  Coach, you haven't had this feeling for a long time.  How would you describe it?  Not a very good one.  We're disappointed.  Where did the game get out of hand, in your opinion?  Or you want to talk about the last drive?  Well, if we had our chances on the last drive, they made some plays, and they made big ones  at the end. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, he don't want to say a word.  Oh, he didn't want to acknowledge that the Giants, you know, usually, like, got to give  the other team a lot of credit.  You know, they just were better than us today.  He didn't go there at all.  We had opportunities.  Nah.  The best he could say is...  We gave it to him.  We had some plays, then they had some plays, but their plays were a little better than our plays.  We're more playier.  He liked to say plays a lot.  Did you expect this kind of game in terms of a defensive, low-scoring game?  Well, it's a three-point game the last time we played him, so we knew it was going to  be a tough, hard-fought game, and it was. 
[00:19:00]  Can you talk about what the defensive plan was in that last drive?  It looked like Eli Manning was going to get sacked, obviously, and he got away and completed  it.  Yeah, we got our hands on a few balls, and we had some pressure on him, but in the end,  they made those plays, and we didn't, so that's the difference in the game.  And I know this is difficult.  What do you tell your team after a perfect season up until this point?  Yeah, well, we're disappointed.  Okay, coach, thanks very much.  Oh, is he pissed.  Oh, man, he's...  Oh, is he angry. 
[00:19:30]  You might find him in the Charles River.  Have you ever heard of Duller Man, though?  Yeah, he...  He's just meh, meh, meh, meh.  He doesn't seem to be a good sport.  He's not a good sport.  He's a horrible talker.  He doesn't want to acknowledge that Coughlin, you know...  No, he was giving those short answers.  He was giving those short answers that just...  Like you said, he was obligated to give.  Yeah.  Yeah, they won the game. 
[00:20:00]  We didn't...  Oh, here's a...  We just...  I always laugh now when I see De Niro speaking instead of acting in a movie because Jimmy  reminds me all the time that he can't talk.  And he just stands there and he puts his stupid glasses on, makes the De Niro face.  And just looks down at the paper and glances up.  I'm very happy to be here for this Tribeca Film Festival.  Shut up.  Act.  Always make a weak joke.  And like, who's more of a New Yorker than me? 
[00:20:30]  It's just the worst.  Good one, Bob.  One more clip from Friday's show, everybody.  Well, you know, I've been rooting for the Pats very early this year.  Very early.  When I knew the Jets just, you know, sucked, I started rooting for the Pats.  Every week I was saying, go, Pats, go.  You know that.  Yeah.  They kind of messed up my sports curse.  They've been winning like crazy.  Well, I guess not.  Oh, boy. 
[00:21:00]  I guess not.  It's just amazing.  It really is.  Let's say hi to Brian in New York.  Brian, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Jimmy, I want to have your mouth.  No, homo.  All right, I got another one for you.  Yeah.  Put a little Eli man in there.  He was so excited.  He didn't even take his pads off.  He couldn't wait to get that damn Super Bowl shirt on.  He had that damn thing on over his pads.  I thought it was hilarious.  Punch it out.  Did he?  Eli Manning, he just looks like a boy. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Well, now he's the MVP of a Super Bowl, so you got to give him a lot of credit, obviously.  Got to give him some credit then, man.  When he was walking around after the game, it looked like he was excited because, you  know, he was going to get, like, an ice cream cone for that victory.  Like, he was going to go see Dad, and they were going to go get ice cream because he had  a great, you know, a great game.  He just doesn't look like a man, but he certainly got the job done yesterday.  All right, we're just getting started.  Can I make a request to Boston fans?  Yeah.  I'm curious of a Boston fan.  Could somebody call in and tell us about Giselle? 
[00:22:00]  Has she been there before?  And also, when did you know, as a fan, that you guys were in trouble?  Like, when you know your team well, like, when did you know, like, ugh, this is going  to be a problem?  Like, oh, boy.  This isn't good.  What was the point for you as a fan when you went, like, ugh?  Yeah.  We're also going to talk to Bob Kelly.  You know, it's a hack bit, but we'll talk about the Super Bowl ads after the break.  Although, we saw a few things that was, kind of raised our eyebrows.  We'll talk about that next.  As long as it's not sex, it's okay. 
[00:22:30]  And speaking of commercials, I think we could officially talk about Bada Bling.  We started talking about Bada Bling, and then someone shut us down, but now it's in  the paper, so now I think we could talk about Bada Bling.  Yeah, we were on this within seconds of seeing it air.  And we don't mind, but we'll get into that as well.  We got lots to do, and the phones are just lit, but if you're going to try to get in,  that's cool.  Call phone number 877-212-ON-A.  Want to hear from Boston.  We got a bunch of Boston calls on the line.  Boston and New York, it's all about those two cities today, so we'll continue in just 
[00:23:00]  a bit.  As we go to break, Bob Kelly with the man crush on Tom Brady.  Baby, it's a dream come true.  You have a crush on a man?  Yes.  Who do you got a crush on?  I have a huge man crush on Tom Brady.  Yeah, I wouldn't have sex with Tom Brady, but I would date him.  Really?  Yeah, I'd like going on a date.  Why do you have a crush on Tom Brady?  He's hot.  Brady has a perfect little bum chin. 
[00:23:30]  His eyebrows are nice and neat.  His hair is...  He's really looked into this.  This isn't even a bit.  His torso is, like, even with his legs.  His hands aren't mushed up.  They're nice hands.  Wow.  You ever see him walk out?  Like, watch him after.  Watch any quarterback on the post-game interviews.  They're sweating still, and they just look grimy.  They got some t-shirt on.  Brady comes out looking like a supermodel.  And he changes it every week.  One week he's kind of rough with a little scally cap on. 
[00:24:00]  The next week he'll come out with a suit with the napkin coming out of the pocket.  Then they'll switch it up and just wear a black raincoat to look like a New York sleek.  He's not even hot.  He's perfect.  Tom Brady is perfect.  I met him, and my knees got weak.  They took us into the locker room, and it was...  Whoa, did you see stuff there?  Just naked football players.  You were in heaven.  He walked out.  He was in a double-breasted gray suit with the white napkin coming out of the pocket. 
[00:24:30]  Pocket, pocket, picture right there.  Oh, God.  I was just staring at him.  I couldn't stop staring.  You know this is not normal, right?  Oh, it's not normal at all.  Around the clock Super Bowl highlights on all the TVs, obviously.  We just saw the Eli Manning play again.  We're trying to figure out if he was in the grasp.  I don't know, man.  And I'm glad that they didn't call that.  Final drive of the Super Bowl. 
[00:25:00]  You let these guys play.  They were calling a lot of stuff last night.  A lot of flags being thrown.  Actually, the Giants dropped a lot of passes, man.  I know that they did that all year.  There was a pass down where they were marching into the end zone,  and it was called an interception, but Manning did not get picked off.  It was one of those ones where the guy had it,  and he basically dished it off to the Patriots.  He throws it off.  Dished it off.  That's amazing.  It's right to me.  Here you go.  You take this. 
[00:25:30]  Hey, on the way, we got a Patriots fan crying on the news in Boston.  We also got the Mayor's Bet thing.  Yeah, the Mayor's Bet.  But first, you guys, like, touched on something during that first break.  Robert De Niro.  It's something Jimmy always gets me laughing with, his De Niro impression,  but not the De Niro that you see in the movies,  which is the cool De Niro that we've grown up with, the gangster De Niro.  Right, right.  The one that knows how to say everything and be the tough guy 
[00:26:00]  because it's written down for him in a script.  But when you see him, and he's just kind of being De Niro,  whether it's at an awards show or he's pitching his Tribeca thing,  he comes off kind of like an idiot.  And he always, like, tries to, like, put some cheesy, like, movie reference in there.  You know, like, you know, here in New York, you know, tempers are raging. 
[00:26:30]  He's just very uncomfortable when he doesn't have a script to go on.  He's got to put his specs on, his reading specs,  and he holds the paper real far away and makes that De Niro lip, the lower lip.  Here on the mean streets.  We got it, Bob.  You know, on my way over here, I was talking to the taxi driver.  And who knows more about being a taxi driver than me? 
[00:27:00]  Good one, Bob.  No one does.  I want to see how accurate you are.  We got some outtakes from the Tribeca Film Festival.  This is Robert De Niro.  When we created Tribeca, we wanted to capture all the emotion,  all the energy, and all the power of a movie.  See for yourself, Tuesday on Fox.  Do another?  Yeah, that's all right.  What?  Good.  Bob, can you try to be just generally more energetic than it?  I'm sorry. 
[00:27:30]  That's energetic.  You don't know what you're talking about.  Yes.  Excuse me.  No.  Tuesday on Fox.  No.  Sorry.  I'm not selling cars, okay?  Not a lot.  Wow.  No.  Sorry.  That's energetic.  That's not energetic.  I'm not selling cars.  He goes, we tried to capture all the emotion of a movie,  unlike I'm doing right now.  I sound like Belichick.  Yeah.  They wanted him, I guess, to hit the Fox thing  and really, like, punch that up.  But he didn't want to. 
[00:28:00]  All right.  Let's say how to...  Fox.  Let's go to Sully in Boston.  Sully.  Sully.  Yellow.  Sully, let's go.  He wanted to say, I knew we'd lose  because Belichick wasn't wearing his normal hoodie.  Oh.  That was pointed out at...  Lucky hoodie?  At my house, yeah.  He went with that red hoodie.  Everyone's used to him in that just awful gray,  just looks like it hasn't been washed in weeks hoodie.  Why would you change that if it's working for you? 
[00:28:30]  You got to have all nice and shiny stuff for the Super Bowl.  We were talking about that on Friday, right?  Except the ring.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Ryan in Boston.  Ryan, what's up?  Hey.  How's it going, fellas?  Hey.  No first-time caller.  Yep.  Allow me to be the first conspiracy theorist,  but is it just me or is it kind of convenient  that right after the senator wants to call a congressional hearing  about the whole Spygate scandal,  all of a sudden the game starts, you know,  the Patriots start playing a bad game, 
[00:29:00]  Brady doesn't look like he's into it,  the offensive line disappeared?  It's just you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, Jimmy, by the way, to answer your question,  if she ever was at any of the games,  they never pointed her out,  and they never announced it on the radio or on the TV.  So I'm going to have to say no.  Well, Travis came out on the break  and said that she was at the AFC Championship game  a couple weeks ago, so maybe she was.  I just hadn't seen her.  Well, they showed her, you know, last night,  drinking wine, sitting there.  She could care less about the fact that her guy was in the Super Bowl. 
[00:29:30]  She doesn't care.  Her life is so different than Tom Brady's.  She's like, all right, I'll go to your cute little Super Bowl,  but then I got to go model somewhere, somewhere cool.  That's the impression I got.  She was just kind of sipping something  and just kind of no real emotion whatsoever.  Well, he's going to need some comforting.  Oh, boy.  Sean in Jersey.  Sean.  Yo.  Hey.  I just wanted to say, 
[00:30:00]  I hope you suck for not picking the Giants.  Thank you.  Go Giants.  And I think that was the best Super Bowl I've seen  since the Bills-Giants game.  It was right up there as one of the best games.  Like Ann said, it was a little slow in the beginning,  but that was interesting to watch.  Yeah, it was.  And it was at the beginning, which is cool.  The Giants just grinding it out.  They had the ball for the first half of the first quarter.  Just grinding it out, running play after running play  after running play.  But then that fourth quarter was just amazing. 
[00:30:30]  And to have it so close, and I mean, you know,  it could have gone either way right up to the end of the game.  You usually don't get that by that time in the game.  But when there's two minutes left in the game,  people are, you know, the TV's been off for a while.  They're just hanging out, maybe playing games or something else.  This game right to the end, everyone was just glued.  Absolutely.  Great game.  This is what's going on on Boston TV this morning.  Well, around here, local bars seem more like funeral homes 
[00:31:00]  last night after the game.  This one Tom Brady fan was more than just a little bummed out  by the game's outcome, and some Patriots fans were reduced to tears.  I'm freaking crying after a freaking sports game,  and I can't even get home, and I'm going to get on the news.  Oh, the poor guy.  That was a guy?  She's just...  The news woman is just some implant.  She has no clue.  Oh, that poor guy.  Whatever. 
[00:31:30]  I'm from St. Louis.  I don't know anything about Boston sports.  And here's what happened when he got home.  Whatever.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  I got to hear that guy again.  Yeah.  That's great.  Sounded like Bruce Kelly.  Oh!  Sounded like Bruce Kelly after the Who.  You got the Who clip?  It's very similar.  Absolutely crying.  Does he say, I'm going to be on the news, too?  Yeah.  He knows.  Yeah, he knows.  Around here, local bars seem more like funeral homes last night after the game.  This one Tom Brady fan was...  All right, we'll spike it up a little. 
[00:32:00]  Hold on.  I'd love that.  Hold on a minute.  Around here, local bars seem more like funeral homes last night after the game.  This one Tom Brady fan was more than just a little bummed out by the game's outcome,  and some Patriots fans were reduced to tears.  Tears.  I don't know where I was.  I'm freaking crying after a freaking sports game, and I can't even get home, and I'm going  to get on the news after this.  Oh, the poor guy.  And I'm going to get on the news after this.  The best part, though, is the stupid lady.  Oh, the poor guy.  Oh, the poor guy. 
[00:32:30]  Okay.  I really don't understand what this means.  I don't care.  Here's our own Bruce Kelly.  Well, he has since been fired, but it's very similar to the time Bruce Kelly went to  Live Aid overseas, wherever the hell, London, and saw the Who, and then he broke down.  I'm sorry.  I'm absolutely crying.  I can't help it.  I really can't.  This is no fake.  You know, the whole moment just kind of got to me with that video.  Yeah.  Game's outcome, and some Patriots fans were reduced to tears. 
[00:33:00]  I'm freaking crying after a freaking sports game, and I can't even get home, and I'm going  to get on the news after this.  Oh, the poor guy.  We talked to this gentleman, this Brady fan.  Bob Kelly has left a message on his phone that he's not going to be talking to anybody for  the next two weeks.  We're going to have that audio on the show in a minute or two, but our pal Bob Kelly is 
[00:33:30]  already in hiding.  Audiences all over the country have just won.  Yeah.  Yeah, no kidding.  What do we got?  Is this the Bob Kelly thing?  Track one.  All right.  Bloppy.  This is Bob Kelly.  We're trying to get him on the show, obviously.  Huge Pats fan.  He was in the Pats locker room.  He took a knee with the Pats.  No, Dane did.  Bob took a knee in the parking lot.  I will not answer my phone for the next two weeks, and I will not listen to any messages.  Any messages will be deleted. 
[00:34:00]  If you want to get in touch with me, call my house phone or send me an email, and that's  it.  So, no messages, no f***ing answer in the phone.  Don't even try.  It's not going to happen.  Go f*** yourself.  I hope Tom Brady dies.  Wow.  That's a jilted lover, is what that is.  Well, you know something?  Maybe Bob is going to want to get away from everything just by playing a little Xbox Call  of Duty.  So, if you want, you can drop him a line at youstink2. 
[00:34:30]  It's youstink2.  And just drop a message if you're on Xbox.  I'm calling him right now at his house.  About the Pats.  I'm sure he'll want to read it while he's trying to forget about it by playing Call of  Duty.  Does he answer him?  Of course he's not.  All I want to hear is the phone pick up and then a gunshot.  Are you on the message thing yet?  Not yet.  It's ringing. 
[00:35:00]  There he goes.  Now we've got to wait through that long message?  You've reached Ploppy.  All right.  Hey, stupid.  We're trying to call you on the radio show.  We're not going to tease you.  And we're not going to make fun of the fact that your team was involved in the most colossal  meltdown in sporting history.  Give us a jingle.  I'm sure he's getting right to the phone. 
[00:35:30]  You know, this New York-Boston rivalry is getting interesting because you got the Yankees and what  they did.  And now you got the Giants with a little payback.  Oh, hell yeah.  It's kind of interesting, this whole freaking rivalry.  Hey, here's the mayor's bet because it's all about, you know, now they've got to pay up.  So this is what the news down here in New York is doing today.  Mayor Bloomberg is waiting for a special delivery from Boston.  He made a Super Bowl wager with his counterpart in Beantown.  But the big winners will be New York City's homeless shelters. 
[00:36:00]  Boston Mayor Thomas Menino will send 42 pounds of Dunkin' Donuts coffee, 100 cups of New England  clam chowder, and 144 Boston cream pies to the shelters and other charities here in the city.  Oh, that's not the clip, Warren.  Because there was a clip that said, and the homeless are the true winners.  Are they?  Because of the, you know, the bed, and they're going to get all this free food.  And I'm like, yeah, that's just like having a Super Bowl ring.  You know, a nice, keeping bowl of clam chowder.  How about they do that every day? 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, yeah, right.  It's like once a year, they give out 100 cups of chowder.  Give a bunch of bums some Boston cream pie.  Why not?  Yeah, right?  And we've got to take notice of this.  Terry Bratshaw, Bratshaw's, you know, had a little potty mouth.  Yeah.  Yeah, he said the F word.  He dropped the F bomb.  Really?  During the Super Bowl pre-show.  Yeah, here it is.  I'm going to pick New England to win their fourth Super Bowl because I want to see history, 
[00:37:00]  and I want them to go 19-0.  I'm a Boston boy, and the New England Patriots turn out to be a perfect fit for immortality.  Wait, what?  I don't know what he said.  Wait, anyone know?  No, he obviously does.  Travis knows.  Of course he does.  Obviously, it's the F bomb, but he was done with his thing and didn't realize his mic was  still alive?  Yeah.  Oh, sorry.  Like that.  Like that, right.  Howie Long was putting on a Patriots hat, and then he commented to Howie Long whether or 
[00:37:30]  not that hat was going to fit his big effing head.  Oh, no kidding.  Ah, that's funny.  Oops, no dumb button for them, huh?  So they get fined, do you think?  Oh, absolutely not.  Of course not.  Of course.  They're not a dopey radio show.  It's just a one-slip thing.  They'll go, you know, it happens.  Yeah, but when it happens on radio, everyone gets fired.  Everybody gets fired.  Clean the room out.  How boring was Tom Petty?  Oh, no, he was good, though. 
[00:38:00]  I mean, it's like there's songs that you've heard before, and he really being...  That was hilarious.  The Super Bowl, they do this thing every year now when the artist starts.  Did it start with...  Was it U2 a couple years back?  I forget now.  I think it was U2, where the band starts playing, and everyone just rushes the field  because they've got to get close to the band.  And I'm like, are they actually doing that for Tom Petty?  No one has cared about Tom Petty in 10 years, and all of a sudden these young kids are excited  to see Tom Petty because they let the floodgates open, and everyone runs onto the field. 
[00:38:30]  It's this big moment that they like to do.  Yeah, everybody that they handpicked.  Right, no one was buying that.  They know who it is.  It's not like from the stands, and I'm just jumping out into the field.  Are they fans coming in, do you think, or are all these Super Bowl people?  No, that's all pre-planned.  They've got a bunch of people.  Your job is to run.  As soon as Tom Petty starts playing, it's to run to the stage and take your places.  And look excited.  And look excited like you're seeing the Beatles for the first time.  It's Tom Petty with a dyed beard.  I mean, he was good, but it was so safe, it's disgusting. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, that's the whole thing.  They've got to make this safe.  When you've got to dig Tom Petty up to do the halftime show, they've completely run out  of anything to put on there that's interesting, compelling, edgy.  Right.  I mean, they tried, you know, with Prince, and they were all upset about his penis guitar.  Last year, that was like a big thing that got complaints, so they couldn't even have 
[00:39:30]  Prince on the stage.  Well, they can't really figure it out every year, because this year when Petty started,  did you see the arrow?  No.  The arrow looked like a penis, and it was heading toward the heart, that kind of, eh,  fused her imagination a little bit.  I'm like, they're never going to get this right.  They're going to mess up every year.  Every year there's going to be something.  Somebody will write about that, going, oh, that looked a little too much like a penis.  I was upset.  They got Ann Murray next year.  Yeah.  On a stool.  Yeah.  I'm saying you needed me while everybody dozes off. 
[00:40:00]  But then it'll backfire on them, because she's sitting on a stool, you know, not one with  four legs, one of hers.  Let's say hi to Bill in Charleston.  Bill.  Hey, guys.  Oh, Bill.  Huh?  What he actually said was, he said, well, that hat fits your bucket head.  Talking about how he longs huge head.  So who said that he cursed then?  I heard it.  Did our team...  Did our guys mess up?  Yeah, I think so.  Who came up with the fact that Bradshaw...  Oh, my God. 
[00:40:30]  Now we got some controversy here.  Nice.  I like controversy.  Here it comes.  Sam, what's up?  Sam?  Oh, boy, Sam.  You can play the uncensored clip if you want.  It'll get dumped out, because the F curse is there.  So he doesn't say bucket head?  Is it?  Because now a couple of people are calling up saying, no, it was your big bucket head.  Get it in there?  Yeah, I got it in the other room.  Can I go listen to it?  Yeah, we're going to take a break in a second, then we'll...  All right, we'll see if...  We'll all go in and listen. 
[00:41:00]  After the break, we'll see if it's bucket head or the curse word, okay?  All right.  All right, thank you, sir.  Let's go to Westchester, say hi to Charles.  Charles, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Looks like a lot of guys in Africa are going to get some Patriots shirts today.  Is that what they do with them?  Yeah, I always wonder, where does that stuff go?  It is funny when you see some umfufu tribe, and they're just running around with these t-shirts  with American slogans and stuff on them.  Yeah, they're running around with Super Bowl loser t-shirts. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  And as the winner.  They have no idea.  They think they're praying to some god.  Perfect season, 19-0 shirts.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Over there, someone getting hacked apart with a machete through one of those shirts.  Some guy in Darfur is using it to tie his arm off after it's been severed.  Mixing it with dirt and oil and making cookies out of them.  It's Tim in Boston.  Tim. 
[00:42:00]  Hey there, Tim.  Come on, guys.  I know we're all tired.  Wake up.  This show's going to move by very, very fast today.  Everyone wants to get in.  All right, phone number 877-212-ONA.  When we get back, we'll talk a little bit about the ads, I guess.  The Panda ads made us go, all right, what's going on here?  They were wonderful.  What is going on here?  And most of the commercials were.  Just about all of them, right?  The only one I liked was the Justin Timberlake one.  Yeah, that was all right.  You liked that one?  Yeah, I thought it was clever.  I mean, it was amusing, but it wasn't adorable. 
[00:42:30]  There was no animals in it.  And when Richard Simmons almost got run over, I was kind of laughing.  But they should have just plowed right through them.  I know they were kind of showing how a car could maneuver.  They should have made the car maneuver a couple of really good times.  So you're like, okay, the car can maneuver.  And then it's up to the driver.  Do I maneuver around this guy?  Nah.  And he chooses to hit him.  And just watch Richard Simmons go flying in the air and then boom, logo time.  Let's see, they don't have a true sense of humor with these ads.  The National Football League will be sending hundreds of Patriots championship shirts and caps to needy children and families around the world. 
[00:43:00]  Around the world.  As opposed to food.  And you can't have it in the United States.  Following the Patriots' defeat at the hands of the Giants in Super Bowl XL line line.  Stupid old numbers.  Letters.  Wait, it's homeless children?  Yeah.  Ah, so you could just, just in case they didn't feel like losers, you know, weren't sure if they were losers. 
[00:43:30]  Now everyone will know.  Yes, you are a loser.  Here's a loser t-shirt.  That doesn't make sense.  Just burn the damn things.  Burn the people?  Every year before the big game, both teams have championship shirts and caps made in the chance that they win the title.  After the game, the NFL donates the licensed, unused apparel of the losing team to third world countries.  Like Nicaragua, Romania, and others, according to the Christian humanitarian organization World Vision. 
[00:44:00]  Never knew that.  I didn't know that either.  They walk around wearing that ridiculous, false shirt.  Right, so everyone could just laugh at you.  That's wonderful.  That's just dumb.  Can't they just recycle the shirt somehow and make something else?  Make something else out of them.  Make underwear out of them.  All right, bless you there, Finn.  I'm looking at Vince Vaughn and his stupid Wild West comedy tour, and he's doing stand-up.  Really?  And he's very safe. 
[00:44:30]  He only went to clean comedians.  Vince, what are you doing?  Oh, really?  Really?  Is that his deal?  Part of the...  6-11.  Just do movies.  Wow.  Why do you have to do stand-up?  All right, we'll take a break and regroup a little bit.  Oh, that looks really funny.  Oh, terrible.  By the way, it's all about the Super Bowl today, but it's also Black History Month, and  every day we're going to be featuring somebody for Black History Month.  The next one is right after the break.  Not the run-of-the-mill ones that everyone does, either. 
[00:45:00]  Ah, the regulars get all the credit every February.  We're looking for the...  The guys that don't get the recognition they really do deserve.  That's right.  We'll have one in just a bit.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Wake up.  How many people are calling in sick today, huh?  What, just here?  Yeah, we got one.  Danny called in sick.  Danny didn't make it in.  Are we to believe that he's actually sick?  Come on, let's get into this for one second.  I don't know.  I was over Danny's house for the first half of the game, and I'm one of those guys I 
[00:45:30]  got to travel around a little bit, you know, share myself.  Almost.  Almost share yourself.  Almost.  Yeah, I had a little party, remember?  Oh, yeah, well, I had made plans, and I had, like, three places to go.  It's one of those, ah, what the hell am I doing?  So I ended up coming into XM and hanging out with Ron and Fez, who were on the air, broadcasting.  Not the game, because that would be illegal. 
[00:46:00]  They were broadcasting some kind of message board bowl that was very, very close to exactly  what was going on on the Super Bowl.  Ah.  So, yeah, a lot of drinking was being done, and when I left Danny, there was some beers  flowing over there, but it could have been something he ate.  Stop!  If he tells me that he got food poisoning or something, I'm going to laugh in his face.  You never know. 
[00:46:30]  At least acknowledge you had a few beers on Super Bowl Sunday and you couldn't make it in.  It was a drinking weekend for you guys, huh?  Yeah, a little bit.  Yeah, it was fun, you know.  It's part of the Super Bowl.  What are you going to do?  It's just unfortunate it's Sunday.  You know, because everybody's got to go to work Monday, and you know you're going to be  partying on Sunday night.  But it's not an early, early night.  Game doesn't end at six or something.  So, yeah, a lot of people don't make it in.  All right. 
[00:47:00]  By the way, a few facts, highlights.  Patriots lose for the first time since January 21st, 2006.  That was to the Colts in the AFC Conference Championship.  Brady sacked five times.  We said that.  I forgot about this one, too.  It's got to be thrown out there.  The Giants win record 11th straight road game.  Wow.  That is insane.  Absolutely insane.  And, of course, the Dolphins, which makes Lindsey's father very, very happy.  He's a massive Dolphins fan. 
[00:47:30]  The 72 Dolphins remain only unbeaten team.  Hey, 18-1's nice, too.  And that one is the biggie.  Biggie.  A couple of things.  Bradshaw did not drop the F-bomb.  No.  It's Buckethead.  So, Sam has finally made a mistake.  Well, Sam cut that off.  And he was, I didn't pull that Steve told me to.  Oh, you're going to blame Steve?  Nope.  Not my mistake.  I got an email before the game even started to make sure somebody checked it out. 
[00:48:00]  And then this morning, as I popped the video open, Steve goes,  Are you getting that Bradshaw clip?  Okay, good.  Well, did Steve say check it out?  And then you made the call.  But then he said, Are you getting that Bradshaw clip?  Clip.  Okay, good.  Now, here's Steve.  What happened, Steve?  How did you find out about this non-cursed Bradshaw clip?  I got a couple emails last night to say that it happened.  And I emailed these guys.  I didn't hear it for myself until this morning.  And to be honest, it sounded like the F-bomb to me.  So, you know, if that's my mistake, that's my mistake. 
[00:48:30]  My mistake.  It's fake.  Well, here it is.  You're a total bull.  Bull.  Here it is uncensored.  I'm going to pick New England to win their fourth Super Bowl because I want to see history.  And I want them to go 19-0.  I'm a Boston boy.  And the New England Patriots turn out to be a perfect fit.  That'll fit that big bucket head.  For immortality.  It's very obvious that it's bucket head.  Big bucket head.  And that's how you executive produce. 
[00:49:00]  Way to go, Steve.  Telling you, it was an event.  I captured it.  Yeah, let's go to Cigars and Scotch.  Cigars.  Hey.  They didn't patent 19 and choke.  18.  Yeah.  And choke.  Wouldn't it be?  Yeah.  How stupid do you feel right now, Cigars?  Got your number wrong.  Mr. Scotch, are you all right?  Yeah, he's hanging up.  Let's go to Gordon in Boston listening on BCN.  Gordon, what's up?  Hey, I'm here from Boston, and I watched the game last night. 
[00:49:30]  You know what?  I'm going to be the first one.  I am deep in the whole Boston-New York hatred of the sports teams crap.  But you know what?  The Patriots were outplayed.  Had nothing to do with the officiating.  Had nothing to do with Gisele or his ankle or nothing.  They were just outplayed.  I don't think anyone's going to give it to New York people.  I don't think anyone's going to.  They're blaming the officiating, really?  I thought it was a...  Oh, you know what?  I finished watching the game, and I had to go to work.  So I had to work last night. 
[00:50:00]  Right.  So a couple of the guys at work were pissing and moaning that bad calls.  And I said, you know what?  There was bad calls on both sides.  There was also drop passes by the Giants.  Oh, what?  Yeah.  You know, and Brady, they got a gift interception, which was, you know, a bad Giants play, but  they just didn't capitalize on it.  It was all about the defense.  Both sides played great, but Giants played a little better on defense.  Oh, my God.  Those Giants were going after Brady for 60 minutes.  He had the fear of God in his eyes for the whole game. 
[00:50:30]  Yep.  He just didn't look right.  Brady didn't look right in the eyes.  He looked nervous or something was going on.  Maybe he suffered a slight concussion.  I don't know.  I don't know.  He just didn't look like he was all there.  Right.  I think it was him just getting hit so much.  He was like, why am I getting hit so much?  This never happens.  Yeah, I'm not used to this.  I've got to protect my supermodel looks.  Right, Bob Kelly?  He did what he got paid to do.  He got him down there.  There was two minutes and 45 seconds left, and they had a four-point lead. 
[00:51:00]  And he said, here you go, defense, win the Super Bowl, and they didn't do it.  You know what?  You're right.  You can't really blame Brady.  He marched down and got the job done.  And then, you know, it was – although his last drive, he had 35 seconds.  That's a lot of time with three timeouts.  Yeah, well, I guess they just wanted to get him into field goal range by going to Moss, then Moss, then Moss.  Yeah, he had three Hail Marys in a row.  I thought they had more time to maybe run a 10, 15-yarder here and there.  Do we have audio of Brady?  Yeah, toss one to Welker. 
[00:51:30]  Huh?  Go ahead.  No, go ahead.  No, toss one to Welker like they had been doing all night in the middle  and let him get to the sidelines at the 40 and go for the big kick.  Let Gostikowski do his job.  Yeah, just tie the damn thing and figure it out in overtime.  All right, sir.  Make me have to listen at work.  Have a good day, guys.  All right.  Gordon from Boston.  Yeah, here's Brady laughing at the fact that the Patriots were only going to score 17 points.  We're only going to score 17 points?  Okay.  Is Klax playing defense? 
[00:52:00]  Well, I know they have confidence.  They should have confidence.  They're the NFC champs.  And they're very talented.  And, you know, we don't make predictions or we just let our play do the talking.  How cocky.  Well, come on.  They all were, though.  I know.  During media week.  Klaxko's a hell of a player.  And if he feels that way, I mean, I think that's great.  I'd hate for him to think that, you know, he's going to lose this game.  I mean, that's obvious.  Nobody does. 
[00:52:30]  So, 23-17.  I wish he said like 45-42 or something like that.  At least he gave us a little more credit for scoring a few points.  Ooh.  Wow.  A little more credit.  Didn't even get the 17, right?  Gave him too much credit.  What was it?  17-14?  Yeah, too much credit for somebody.  All right.  Ooh.  Let's go to John.  John, what's up?  Hey, could you imagine Vegas must be dancing the jig this morning?  Hey, that isn't necessary. 
[00:53:00]  Huh?  What?  I said in Vegas they must be dancing the jig because nobody bet the Giants.  What?  What?  What are the odds of the Giants?  I'm just saying it again.  You broke up.  What was that?  I said Vegas must be dancing the jig.  Hey.  Because nobody bet the Giants.  What's wrong with your phone, sir?  John. 
[00:53:30]  He's gone.  There you go.  What a silly dance.  Well, the Panda Bear commercial.  Let's just play it.  Yeah.  Let's just play it to begin with.  The Super Bowl ads were okay.  I don't know.  I don't think we should spend too much time talking about the dumb commercials.  They lost their luster years ago.  Yeah.  It used to be a big thing.  Now it's just like, who cares?  And now they're online like weeks before the Super Bowl.  So it's not even a big surprise for a lot of people. 
[00:54:00]  But the Panda ad kind of raised our eyebrows at my crib.  Because, you know, we do this type of thing on the radio.  First of all, you'll never hear it because they dump out of it.  You know, you can't do Asian accents on a morning radio show anymore.  Or at least this morning radio show.  Other morning radio shows are allowed.  But they had a little problem, what, eight months ago.  So because of that, no one's allowed to do Asian accents on the radio here.  Which is completely ridiculous.  Because the Asians do have a sense of humor. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  It's just amazing.  So the Sales Genie ad.  Listen to this.  Okay, guys.  American chicks love me for an accent.  Well, hold on.  That's the Carlsman C, which is pretty good too.  Ting Ting, we have no customers, no sales.  We're going out of business.  Ling Ling, I am not going back to the zoo.  Then we need a sales miracle.  Panda Psychic, help.  We need customers.  Tell Ling Ling to get 100 free sales leads at SalesGenie.com.  And stop eating the bamboo furniture. 
[00:55:00]  Wow.  Look at all these sales leads.  Thank you, Sales Genie.  Hey, kids.  You want to go see the grizzly bears at the zoo?  For 100 free sales leads, go to SalesGenie.com.  Now, we've had a lot of comedians in the last six to eight months, and they attempt to do  an Asian joke or a quick little Asian accent.  And this company we work for insists that all Asian accents get dumped out of on our radio  show, which just has infuriated us for so long, I can't even tell you. 
[00:55:30]  It's one of these things we're fighting behind the scenes like crazy.  And there you go, Super Bowl, you know, watched by close to, what, a billion people?  And there it is.  There it is.  A little Asian accent selling a little product.  No one got hurt.  Yeah.  Just amazes me.  Why is that okay?  Just shows you that the stupid lawyers are completely out of touch.  Completely out of touch.  Yeah, why is that?  Because it's okay.  Because it's okay.  That's why.  You got panicky peats that think they know what they're doing behind the scenes. 
[00:56:00]  Panicky peats.  Panicky peats.  Everyone's named Pete, and they're panicking.  Well, you know.  Panicky Ted's doesn't sound right.  No.  But me and Jimmy were like, well, of course.  Yep.  Of course.  And then they did one in an Indian accent.  Yeah.  Yeah, there was like, they were doing accents.  They were doing stereotypes.  Stereotypes were all over the place.  Because then you had the Carlsman see a Bud Light commercial with the foreign accents. 
[00:56:30]  Yep.  You know, it's fine is the point I'm getting at.  It's fine if it's done in humor and you're not trying to be hurtful, even though I think  that should be okay on the radio.  But certainly if you do a little accent and you're trying to get a little humor out of  it, it should be fine.  I liked Ben C.S. commercial, actually.  Did you like it?  Was it a dressed race?  Yeah.  Okay, guys.  American chicks love before the accent.  Go.  You have the ties of a Sherpa. 
[00:57:00]  Say hi.  Hi.  No, not hi, hi.  Hi.  Hi, hi, hi.  She has your eyes.  Watch the master do it, boys.  Hello.  You are so very sexy.  Sorry.  I'm with someone.  Bud Light.  Endless refreshment from start to finish.  Bud Light keeps it coming.  We make sandwich.  I am neat.  It's just nothing but stereotypical accent.  It was an Indian guy at first because you can't see it. 
[00:57:30]  The Indian guy was the one who said, Sherpa thighs.  And the Asian guy was the one who said something about, she has your eyes.  Which I didn't, I don't know what it was about, but that was an Asian guy.  And then there was a white guy at the end.  And then that leads to something that has hit the New York papers.  We'll explain for the rest of the country.  But this is big.  This is big in New York.  They're promoting a new lottery ticket by doing this.  It don't mean a thing if it ain't Bada Bling. 
[00:58:00]  Bada, Bada, Bada, Bada, Bada, Bada, Bada, Bada Bling.  Bada meets Bling.  It's Bada Bling.  The new instant game from the New York Lottery.  Bada Bling.  Now, we brought this to everyone's attention, I think, last week.  And, man, were we shut down quickly.  Yes, we were.  Quickly.  I'm like, but we're on top of this stuff.  And, of course, now the story's in the paper because we had a point how ridiculous this commercial was.  It's selling a new lottery ticket, Bada Bling, and it's getting the rap dudes together with the goombas. 
[00:58:30]  With the mobsters, the soprano cast lookalikes.  Right.  And, yeah, they're getting together for Bada Bling.  Bada Bling.  The Bada part is the Italian guys.  And the Bling.  And the Bling part of the brothers doing a little hip-hop.  Or the uptown hip-hop dudes.  And they bring them together like would never, ever happen in real life, ever, ever.  That was one of the points we were trying to make last week.  Yeah.  They would never work together, but for the lottery, of course they would. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And we had one of the actors, he was going to call in, he was playing one of the Bling guys.  Yep.  And I guess he's a fan of the show, and he goes, oh, dudes, I listen to you guys all the time, I want to talk about this.  And, I don't know, maybe we could get him on a little later this morning.  But it hit the paper today that the campaign is over.  Yeah, the campaign's over.  Apparently, one of these Italian-American groups was a little upset about the stereotype, again, the gangster thing.  Why does it always have to be the mob when Italians are represented, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:59:30]  Why?  Because the mob is made up of Italians.  It doesn't mean every Italian is in the mob.  Well.  But it does mean that the mob is made up of Italians.  So why can't that be portrayed?  Now, that doesn't mean it can't be portrayed so awfully and badly and just that you're embarrassed to watch it.  That commercial was horrid.  But a bling.  And then they go, they really got upset because at one point, I guess, in the commercial, one of the big, fat Italian guys goes, it is three ways to win. 
[01:00:00]  A tree.  It's classic.  It's just like real life, though.  The blacks run the numbers for the mob.  I mean, that's exactly what that's like with the lottery.  Three ways to win.  So who's outraged?  Some guy.  Stella.  Oh, well, maybe a girl.  Stella Grillo, a representative of Sons of Italy in America's New York chapter, made the complaint. 
[01:00:30]  I know a lot of people are saying you're overly sensitive, she added.  But Americans have become more sensitive to most racial groups, and it should apply to Italian Americans.  All right.  First of all, Americans have not become more sensitive to most racial groups.  No, racial groups.  A very small group of Americans have been, have gotten a bit sensitive.  In general, no one gives a crap.  In general, we are all stereotyping our asses off at work, at the bars, wherever, wherever you may be.  Making jokes. 
[01:01:00]  It's not America.  America wasn't pissed off about what Imus said.  It was a small group of people that were pissed off, that don't represent the masses, by the way.  No.  Whatsoever.  Yeah, tree chances.  She was upset about that.  And, well, the game is still going to go on.  But they're not going to do a Bada Bada Bada Bling commercial anymore.  And they issued an apology saying they didn't mean to insult anyone, the lottery.  Let's say hi to this dude. 
[01:01:30]  I don't know your name, sir.  It's not on the screen.  How does the lottery apologize?  Like, what are people going to do, boycott it and not try to win $8 million?  I don't understand.  Like, no one's going to not play the lottery, a bunch of addicts.  I think the run just ended.  I think it's a timing thing.  This thing hit the paper today, but the ads were supposed to end today anyway.  Yeah.  So, John, what's up?  Hey, who did the Italians want to be portrayed on?  Would they want to roll out their grandmother in a black dress?  I mean, what?  Honestly, John, I think most Italians don't give a crap.  It's always a small percentage of people that want to think for everybody. 
[01:02:00]  Most Italians, I'd imagine, are just kind of laughing at it.  Oh, that's funny.  Yeah, they don't care.  They don't care.  Andrew in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, man.  I got a new Super Bowl song for the Patriots.  Okay.  40 seconds to go.  He lied to throw.  Back to go, whoa, whoa.  Ha, ha, ha.  Go Giants.  He's goofing on one of the Super Bowl songs. 
[01:02:30]  Right.  Well, this was my favorite awful Super Bowl song.  Just a little taste here.  Here we are on the brink of destiny.  Everything that we worked for, all to see.  Like a champion who knows just what was won forever.  You'll always belong with the strong and the brave. 
[01:03:00]  Singing your name.  No one else could ever make us be there.  You're more than a champion.  A legend is born. 
[01:03:30]  No one else could ever make us be there.  No one else could ever make us be there.  No one else could ever make us be there.  From the struggle when we were only kids.  Now the tables have turned and you're a star.  And that's who you are.  You always belong with the strong and the brave  Singing your name 
[01:04:00]  We'll remember eternity  Born and the brave  That's terrific, that's terrific  The champion, the legend is born  The champion, the legend is born  The champion, the legend is here 
[01:04:30]  That's funny  No one can take it away from you  Damn, you've just been pwned  You're gonna see  How did you see that, jerk? 
[01:05:00]  I've made an ass of myself  I'm sorry I did that  I'm embarrassed that I did that  I know we can  Now choke yourself 
[01:05:30]  Now choke yourself  Now choke yourself  Now choke yourself  That's terrible, I'm sorry  The legend is here 
[01:06:00]  I'm down  Hey, looking good sports fans  Okay, terrific  Oh my god  That's great  Well  Well, yeah  That was bad 
[01:06:30]  Made me feel good  That was wonderful  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Hey, the ring  You see the rings?  I was only joking 
[01:07:00]  Be a giant scared as hell  I'm late on  Stand a chance  Stand a chance  We start the charges  New York's gonna get a smack  18-0  18-0  One more to go  Super Bowl  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa  Man, I've never seen nothing like this before  How a team gonna go  Yeah, we want to get Stella Grillo on the phone today 
[01:07:30]  Yeah  That would be very nice  So  Yeah, I want to  I asked this last night  Matt in Brooklyn  What's up, Matt?  What's going on, man?  Hey, guys, what's up?  I want to ask Jimmy  Because I'm a big cowboy fan  As a cowboy fan  How could Jimmy root for the giant?  Believe me, it was a very foreign thing  But, I mean, first of all  They were tremendous underdogs 
[01:08:00]  And second of all  I just  I don't know why I wanted the Patriots to lose  I just didn't want Boston fans  To be that happy  In a way that my Cowboys  Had never been that happy  I'm the same way, too  But I just don't understand  How you could root for them  But the only thing that could  Like the saving grace for me  Of seeing the Giants win  Was Archie Manning  Knowing that he had this plan  For his kids to win the Super Bowl  And that was the only thing  That could, like, I don't know  Alleviate the pain  But other than that  I did not want to see that team win  Dude, normally I wouldn't have  Believe me 
[01:08:30]  If that was the Chargers  The Dolphins  Any other team  I would have rooted  Against the Giants heavily  But I guess because  They were such underdogs  And, you know  I mean, I like Michael Strahan  Because he's come in and hung out  So I definitely  Didn't want to see the Patriots  They were too cocky  Boston was really cocky  Just wanted to copyright 19-0  And it was just starting  To really irritate me  Yeah  I didn't feel like  They were that cocky, though  Really?  Oh, the whole city  I felt like was  Really?  Oh, my God  You just talk to the fans  Like, I mean, I'm a fan  So I know what it's like  And Bobby  They're like, they're going to kill them 
[01:09:00]  They're going to run over them  Nobody thought the Giants had a shot  So I kind of like the fact  That they  I mean, look  They beat Dallas in Dallas  They beat Green Bay in Green Bay  I mean  And they almost beat the Patriots  Let's not forget  They were the wild card  Yeah  I really thought that Boston  Was going to run the mill  In all three sports this year  The Celtics  The Patriots  And the Red Sox  I thought it was going to get done  Yeah  Believe me  Come next season  I'll be wanting the Giants  To go 3-13 again  With a lot of spine injuries  Let's go to Cigars and Scotch 
[01:09:30]  Spine injuries  Cigars and Scotch  Reloaded here  What's up, Cigars?  Hey  It's too bad that they didn't patent  18 and choke  Eh?  That goes Holiday  He's on the track  He's at the wall  She's gone  The milkman delivered  Now  What are they saying?  They're saying  What they're trying to say is  They're saying  And by that you mean you said  Right  We got to get this guy on again 
[01:10:00]  Well around here  Local bars seem more like funeral homes  Last night after the game  This one Tom Brady fan  Was more than just a little bummed out  By the game's outcome  And some Patriots fans  Were reduced to tears  Back from where I was  I'm freaking crying  After a freaking sports game  And I can't even get home  And I'm going to get on the news  Oh the poor guy  Oh the poor guy  She has no  That's good  That could just be  Ah

[01:12:30]  But she writes  Or he writes  I don't know who this is  Rockland County  Okay  From padded bra to padded cell  The Brittany Spears story  And then you got  You got gut shot Drew  From Howell  This is really interesting  Actually  How many dads  Went to bed last night  After seeing Archie Manning  Raising two Super Bowl MVPs  Oh god  Then think about the fat  Unmotivated PSP  Playing slobs  They're raising  And wondering where  They went wrong 
[01:13:00]  Oh that's perfect  Yeah Archie Manning  Raised not one  But two  Super Bowl MVPs  Amazing  Really  And uh  Wow yeah  Got a couple of people  That are  Oh look at our phones  Yeah let's talk to  Stella  Stella  Hi Stella  Hi  How are you  I'm good  How are you  Pretty good  You guys got a lot  Of press in the paper  Today huh  Well that was from  New York Post  Yes  Yes yes  Okay  Stella can we tell  Everybody who you are 
[01:13:30]  Just in case they're  Just tuning in  Okay  I am the New York  State President  Of the Commission  For Social Justice  Which is the  Anti-defamation branch  Of the Order Sons  Of Italy and America  And you guys had a  Problem with the  Italian American  Portrayal as  Mobsters  In this  Bada Bling commercial  Correct  From the Lottie  From the New York  Yes we did  A lot of our members  Were kind of offended  Because it's only a  Perpetuity of the  Sopranos  Persona 
[01:14:00]  That Italian Americans  Have been  Well bestowed with  Since the  Well it goes far back  Yeah  Well Stella  But let me ask you  Do you feel  Do you feel that  There's truth  In the stereotype  In that the people  They're portraying  In that  Which is certainly  Not all Italians  But do you think  That at least  They portrayed  Them accurately  Yes they did  Well they  Portrayed  And admittedly so  They thought the  Sopranos series 
[01:14:30]  Was a popular series  And they thought  It was entertaining  And it has been  A popular series  But it certainly  Has helped to  Portray the  Stereotyping  Of Italian Americans  But does it do that  Or does it just  Portray a certain  Part of Italian Americans  Part of their history  That is you know  It's known  Let's put it this way  Yes  I have had calls  From students  Who are 
[01:15:00]  Studying in various  Colleges in New York  City  From out of town  And the first thing  Their peers  Or their  Fellow students  Will ask  Is your family  A member of the  Mafia  Because they have  An Italian last name  Well Stella  Understandably so  But do you  Do you mind  Like the  The Italian theme  Or the obsession  Over Italian heritage  Say in Columbus Day  Parades  Or in any of the  Other 442 Italian  Festivals  That you  I guess your website  Helps promote 
[01:15:30]  You mean  Do we  Are we upset  Because  Positive stereotypes  Say  Like if there's  Any positive  Stereotypes  Or positive  Things that are  Attributed to  Italians  Does that bother  You when it  Say the  Columbus Day  Parade  Which is  Basically all  About Italian  Heritage  Well the  Columbus Day  Parade  Is all about  Italian  Heritage  And it's  All about  The fact  That an  Italian  Actually  Accomplished  The things  That Columbus  Accomplished  And it had  To be  Acknowledged 
[01:16:00]  Because  Our country  Is named  After an  Italian  It's  It's  All of  Our  Many of  Our cities  Many of  Our themes  Are from  Columbia  Columbus  So  It's  Been  Acknowledged  Over the  Years  Sure  And now  It seems  Like  There  Are  Groups  Out there  That feel  That well  This is  Not true  So  Well why  Is the  Positive  Side  Of  Italian  Americans  Not  True  And the 
[01:16:30]  Not  Positive  Side  Or the  Stereotype  Side  True  But still  I don't  Think  Anybody  Saying  That  You know  America  Vespucci  The country  Wasn't  Named  After him  Or that  The Italian  Positive  Stereotypes  Aren't  True  What  My  Trouble  With  Organizations  Like  You  Guys  Is  You  Tend  To  Only  Want  One  Truth  Portrayed  And  That's  A  Positive  Truth  Like  You  Don't  Mind  Ethnicity  Like when  You look  At  The Sopranos  What I  Meant  By  The  Accuracy  Not  Of  Bada  Bling  Portraying  The  Sopranos  But  Of 
[01:17:00]  The  Sopranos  Portraying  Guys  Who  Are  In  The  Mob  I  Mean  That  Is  An  Italian  Organization  By  Their  Own  Statement  They  Have  To  Trace  You  Back  To  The  Motherland  Back  To  Sicily  To  Become  Quote  Unquote  Made  I  Guess  So  That's  Them  Saying  That  Why  Would  You  A  Problem  With  That  Stereotype  Being  Portrayed  But  Not  A  Positive  One  I  Want  To  Answer  You  By  A  Personal  Answer  My  Grandparents  Came  From  Sicily  They  Are  Not  Members  Of  The  Mob  Nobody  In  My  I  Never  Even  Grew  Up  Knowing  That  There  Was  A  Mob 
[01:17:30]  Until  I  Read  About  It  Or  I  Saw  The  God  Father  This  Was  Not  Part  Of  Our  Life  So  If  I  Would  You  Believe  That  Less  Than  One  Percent  Of  Italian  Americans  Are  Actually  Involved  In  Organized  Crimes  Yeah  I  Would  Believe  That  But  That  One  Percent  Is  Very  It's  Intriguing  To  People  People  Like  Seeing  It  Portrayed  It  Makes  Some  Of  The  Most  Popular  Movies  That  Are  Ever  Made  And  I  Honestly  Don't 
[01:18:00]  Think  Because  I'm  Italian  And  It  Doesn't  Bother  Me  In  The  Least  I  Think  The  Major  Of  Italians  Aren't  Bothered  By  It  Because  It  Hasn't  It  Hasn't  Prevented  Us  From  Doing  Anything  That  We  Want  To  Do  Whether  It's  Advance  In  Our  Jobs  Get  A  Career  Raise  A  Family  I  Don't  Think  These  Movies  Or  Stereotypes  Have  Really  Affected  Italian  Americans  In  A  Negative  Way  I  Think  It's  A  Lot  Of  It  Is  Entertainment  Movies 
[01:18:30]  Television  Based  On  Something  That  Did  Happen  It  Was  Part  Of  Italian  Heritage  And  Again  Not  Every  Italian  Heritage  But  No  It  Every  Ethnic  Or  Every  Ethnic  Group  Has  Their  Criminal  Element  Absolutely  True  Yet  If  You  Go  Into  And  I'm  Not  Going  To  Mention  Ethnic  Groups  There  Are  Other  Forms  Of  Criminal  Activity  In  Other  Ethnic  Groups  Sure  They  Always  Say  Like 
[01:19:00]  The  Russian  Mafia  Why  Isn't  It  The  Russian  Mob  The  Russian  Criminals  Because  They're  Scary  They  Do  Scary  Things  Whatever  They  Do  They  Do  But  What  I  Am  Trying  To  Say  Is  That  Every  Ethnic  Group  Has  Their  Criminal  Element  Yet  It  Is  Not  Glamorized  And  It  Not  It  It  Doesn't  It  Glamorized  Movies  The  Italian  Ethnic  Movies  I  Hate  To  I  Hate  To  Interrupt  You  But  First  Of  All  It 
[01:19:30]  Is  Glamorized  When  You  Look  At  Black  Thugs  And  Gangsters  That  Lifestyle  Is  Glamorized  Tremendously  And  I  Think  The  Reason  The  Italian  Mafia  Is  So  Glamorized  Is  Maybe  I  Will  Believe  You  That  They're  Only  1%  Of  The  Italians  Of  Of  Of  course  99%  Are  Not  Criminals  Or  Not  A  Member  Of  Organizations  But  You  Know  What  They've  Had  A  Tremendous  Influence  In  Our  Country  Not  All  Of  It  Bad  I  Mean  If  It  Wasn't  For  Them  There  Probably  Wouldn't  Be  A  Las  Vegas  As  We  Know  It  And  From  What  I  Understand  As  An  Entertainer  It  Was  A lot  More  Fun  To  Work  There  When  They  Had  It  They've  Had  A  Tremendous 
[01:20:00]  Influence  In  The  Unions  I  Mean  They've  Been  A  Really  Powerful  Group  I  Mean  This  Was  Not  A  Small  Fringe  Group  That  People  Just  Stereotyped  And  Made  Popular  They  Were  Very  Very  In  The  Forefront  Of  American  Life  For  A  Long  Time  So  Now  We  Should  Continue  To  Portray  And  Let  Everybody  Think  That  Most  Italian  Americans  Are  Mob  Related  Do  You  Think  That  That  That's  Crazy  Do  You  Think  Most  People  Think  That  Most  Italians  I  Don't  Think  So  I  Really  Think  People  Take  It  For  What  It  Is  It 
[01:20:30]  There  Is  The  Element  Of  Truth  Because  These  People  Did  And  Do  Exist  A  Majority  Of  Them  Are  Italians  I  Mean  You  Look  At  The  Names  In  The  Paper  When  There's  Mobs  Arrest  And  They're  Italians  It  And  It's  Glamorized  Because  There  Was  And  Especially  When  You  Look  Back  At  The  Old  Days  Of  It  It  Was  This  Kind  Of  Glamorous  Lifestyle  That  People  Have  In  Their  Head  If  You  Don't  Look  At  How  Gruesome  The  Actual  Murders  Were  When  You  Separate 
[01:21:00]  Yourself  From  The  Reality  Of  It  And  Watch  It  In  A  Movie  People  Are  Taken  By  It  Yeah  Exactly  We  Don't  Talk  About  The  Irish  We  Don't  Talk  About  A  Lot  Of  Other  Ethnic  We  Do  They're  Not  As  Interesting  I  Need  To  Tell  But  They're  Not  As  Powerful  And  The  Irish  Mob  Or  The  Jewish  Mobs  Or  Gangsters  That  Were  When  The  Jews  First  Came  Here  They  Just  Weren't  As  Powerful  In  Like  I  Guess  The  20th  Century  As  The  Italian  Mafia  Was 
[01:21:30]  I  Don't  Know  Why  That  Was  But  I  Mean  Criminally  They  Did  A  Lot  They  Were  In  The  Forefront  Of  Our  Lives  For  A  Long  Time  And  I  Not  Even  Knocking  Them  I  Mean  They  Did  A  Lot  Of  Things  That  I  Like  As  Well  As  I  Said  Now  We've  Got  Italian  Americans  In  Every  Walk  Of  Life  Do  They  Still  Have  To  Be  Stigmatized  By  This  Persona  I  Don't  Even  Disagree  With  You  But  Why  Is  It  That  You  Only  Want  Certain  Stereotypes  To  Be  Talked  About  That  You  Don't  Mind  The  Positives 
[01:22:00]  If  You  Were  Against  All  Stereotypes  I  Will  Tell  You  Something  My  Husband  Was  A  Professor  In  The  70s  When  Italian  American  Professors  Could  Not  Get  Tenure  In  Any  City  University  So  There  Was  A  Lot  Of  Discrimination  And  It  Had  Nothing  To  Do  With  The  Fact  That  They  Had  They  Worked  Hard  They  Did  What  They  Had  To  Do  There  Was  A  Lot  Of  Discrimination  Out  There  And  True  It's  Not  There  Now  But  We  Still  Continue 
[01:22:30]  To  Be  Painted  By  This  Same  Brush  I  Don't  Know  Italian  Americans  Are  Painted  By  The  Brush  I'll  Tell  You  Something  Personally  Again  I'm  Italian  And  I  Like  To  Think  Especially  In  This  Age  Of  Political  Correctness  Where  If  You  Say  Anything  About  Black  People  You  Have  Reverend  Al  Sharpton  You  Have  This  One  That  One  Asian  Groups  Have  Their  Spokes  People  That  Make  It  Impossible  To  Up  Any  Humor 
[01:23:00]  That's  Race  Based  As far  As  Asians  Or  Blacks  Go  I  Like  To  Think  That  As  Italian  That  We're  Beyond  That  That  We  Can  Take  A  Joke  We  Can  Take  A  Stereotype  And  It  Doesn't  Have  To  We  Don't  Need  A  Representative  To  Come  And  Speak  For  All  Of  Us  I  I  Find  That  Insulting  I  Find  It  Insulting  When  An  Asian  Representative  Comes  Up  And  Wants  Or  Whatever  Upsets 
[01:23:30]  Them  And  I'm  Going  To  Represent  Everybody  By  Saying  It  Upsets  The  Entire  Group  I  Like  To  Think  Italians  Are  Beyond  That  We're  Probably  Some  Of  The  Best  Joke  Tellers  There  Are  I'll  Tell  You  That  Much  I  Heard  A  Lot  Growing  Up  And  I  Think  I  Like  To  Think  We're  Beyond  That  Why  Should  We  Be  Why  Should  We  Be  I  Think  If  It's  A  Tit  For  Tat  Thing  Where  It's  Like  Well  Just  Because  Blacks  Asian  And  I  Use  Black  And  Asian  A lot  Because  Those  Are  Really  At  The  Forefront  Right 
[01:24:00]  Now  Polish  Jokes  Anymore  And  You  Shouldn't  Well  Polish  Jokes  Why  The  Poles  Never  Really  Came  Out  And  Said  Stop  The  Joking  It  Just  Kind  Of  Got  Old  And  Passe  Well  The  Poles  Are  So  Stupid  They  Didn't  Even  Realize  That  They  Were  Being  Made  Fun  Of  So  I  Don't  Think  It  Oh  No  That's  Absolutely  It  Because  I  Got  Some  Polish  Heritage  In  My  Family  And  We  Were  Just  Dumb  We  Just  Didn't  Realize  That  People  Were  Making  Jokes  I 
[01:24:30]  Just  Call  The  Papers  Right  I  Think  It  Shows  Weakness  In  A  Group  When  You  Have  To  Protect  Everybody  I  Think  It  Was  We're  A  National  Organization  So  Obviously  People  All  Over  The  Country  Have  This  But  You're  An  Ethnicity  Like  This  Is  What  I'm  Saying  You're  An  Ethnicity  Based  Organization  So  You're  Actually  A 
[01:25:00]  Fraternal  Organization  You  Know  What  I'm  Saying  And  We  Do  Have  An  Anti  Defamation  Arm  Very  Similar  To  B'nai  Briss  And  Other  Anti  Defamation  Arms  Of  Other  Organizations  Defamation  I  Don't  Even  Disagree  With  That  Stella  But  Defamation  Is  Coming  Out  And  Saying  All  Italians  Are  Criminals  And  I  Would  Certainly  Agree  That  You  Should  Be  Very  P.O.  At  That  But  Portraying  A  Stereotype  That  Yeah  Is  Negative  But  Is  True  It's 
[01:25:30]  A  True  Stereotype  No  One  Says  That  But  The  Segment  That  Is  Is  Like  They're  Portrayed  Yeah  So  Why  Can't  That  Be  Portrayed  And  Just  Left  As  Entertainment  Or  Even  History  Like  You  Know  I  Watched  Plenty  Stuff  On  The  History  Channel  About  La  Cosa  Nostra  And  It's  Accurate  Like  If  They  Were  Saying  That  This  Might  Sound  Like  A  Silly  Example  But  If  They  Were  Portraying  A  Bunch  Of  Italians  As  Brain  Surgeons  Or  All  These  Things  And 
[01:26:00]  You  Say  Well  That's  Kind  Of  A  Disproportionate  Portrayal  Of  Italians  As  Brain  Surgeons  You  Wouldn't  On  Principle  Be  As  Upset  They  Wouldn't  Portray  Italians  That's  Why  I  Said  That's  Why  I  Said  If  They  May  Select  One  Brain  Surgeon  Who  Accomplished  Something  And  It  Wasn't  Because  He  Was  An  Italian  It  Was  Because  Of  His  Own  accomplishment  Unless  The  Brain  Is  That  A  Concrete  Huh  Stella  Why  Take  That  Brain  Surgeon  Who  Happens  To  Be  Italian  And  Paint  Him  With  The  Mafia  Brough  And  Say  Well  Okay  Maybe  His  Grandparents 
[01:26:30]  Were  No  What I'm  Saying  Is  You  Wouldn't  Mind  A  Positive  Stereotyping  Even  If  It  Was  Slightly  Inaccurate  I  Guess  That's  Human  Nature  But  That's  Why  Organizations  Like  Yours  Kind  Of  Bother  Me  Because  I  Feel  Like  You  Don't  Mind  Something  Inaccurately  Portrayed  If  It's  Kind  Of  In  Your  Favor  I  Have  Not  Seen  Any  Of  The  Positive  Image  Portion  Of  Our  Organization  Being  Portrayed  To  The  Point  Where  It  Was  It  Wasn't  Correct  Okay  And  You  Just  Answered  Your  Own  Question 
[01:27:00]  Why  Does  The  History  Channel  Do  A  Series  On  Cosa  Nostra  Did  They  Do  Any  Series  On  Any  Other  Criminal  Element  Of  Any  Other  Ethnic  Actually  Yes  I've  I've  Seen  Plenty  Of  Shows  It's  A  Show  Called  Gang  Land  And  They  Portray  The  Bloods  The  Crips  The  Latin  Kings  That  South  American  Gang  That's  A  Colombian  Drug  Lord  Gang  My  Goodness  Yeah  Colombian  Drug  Lord  And  The  Mafia  Which  You  Know  Is 
[01:27:30]  Part  Of  That  Criminal  Element  But  Again  It's  Not  Portraying  All  Italians  As  Mafiosa  It's  Portraying  The  Mafiosa  As  Italians  Because  That  Is  What  Happened  It's  What  They  Are  So  You  Know  That's  Just  Kind  Of  What  What  It  Is  And  And  It's  Hard  To  Accept  That  All  Italians  Are  Upset  By  This  That  They  Need  Representation  Many  Novelists  Who  Write  Excellent  Books  If 
[01:28:00]  They  Have  A  Criminal  Or  Some  Kind  Of  Shady  Character  In  The  Book  His  Name  Is  Vinny  Joe  With  Some  Other  Italian  Sounding  Last  Name  Because  The  Books  Are  Written  By  Jews  Stella  We  All  Know  They're  The  Problem  Of  Course  It's  Not  True  You  Silly  You  Called  Sarcasm  We  Learned  About  That  We  Got to  Wrap  This  Up  We  We  We  Appreciate  You  We  Appreciate  You  Coming  On  Absolutely  You  Have  The  Opian  Anthony  Show  Thank  You  Very  Much  For  Coming  On  The  Opian  Anthony  Show  Thank 
[01:28:30]  You  Very  Much  Stella  Stella  Que  Bella  Cosa  There  She  Goes  Stella  Everyone  There  She  Goes  I'll  Never  Understand  That  She  Sounds  Like  A  Hoot  By  The  Italy  Italy  Old  School  I  Know  Bottle  Could  You  Get  A  Bottle  Get  Another  Bottle  Out  Of  The  Fridge  I  Never  Understand  That  I  Just  Don't  Get  The  Whole  We  Need  A  Whole  Organization  To  Represent  Us  Because  Who's  Upset  First 
[01:29:00]  Of  All  As  An  Italian  And  Knowing  A lot  Of  Italian  People  We  Kind  Of  Bask  In  That  Whole  Mafia  Thing  It's  Sort  Of  A  It's  A  Pride  Thing  Having  That  Background  Because  It  Did  Become  So  Powerful  That  It's  Kind  Of  Like  Yeah  That's  Kind  Of  Cool  And  The  Gangsters  Come on  That's  The  Coolest  Crap  You  Ever  See  In  Movies  Jesus  I'll  Tell  You  Why  I  Dislike  Her  Organization  Less  Than  Most  Of  Them  Because  They're  Coming 
[01:29:30]  After  Italians  I  Don't  Agree  With  But  She's  Going  They're  Sick  Of  Italians  Portraying  Mobsters  They're  Sick  Of  It  All  Together  Prejudice  Against  Italians  In  This  Day  And  Age  But  Asian  Groups  Will  They're  Completely  Fraudulent  But  At  At  At  She's  Consistently  Unfunny  And  They  Get  On  Italians  This  Group  Will  Get  On  Italians  Whereas  You  Won't  See  Reverend  Al  Getting  On  Black  People  You  Won't  See

[01:33:30]  Portrayals  In  Movies  And  So  For  Other  Things  Focus  On  The  People  Whether  It's  Science  Education  Films  I  Mean  There's  Plenty  Of  Actors  In  Films  That  Have  Done  Non  Mafia  Related  Roles  Non  Goofball  Related  Roles  I  Think  They're  Off  Base  With  Degree  Yeah  The  Commercial  Was  Really  Bad  And  That's  The  Point  That  I  Would  Make  But  To  Go  After  Just  Because  It's  Mob  Related

[01:38:30]  News  There  What  Could  Make  A  City  Happier  Than  A  Super  He  Said  It  Happy  For  Being  The  Well  Fan  Of  The  Losing  Team  Take  Note  Track  One  Boston  News  Talks  To  A  Patriots  Fan  But  The  First  Track  Is  The  Giants  Guy  Who  Labeled  That  That  Would  Be  Sam  So  Finally  He  Has  Made  Sam  So  That  Was  The  Giants  Guy  Very  Happy  And  Then  He  Got  This  In  Boston  After 
[01:39:00]  A  Freaking  Sports  Game  He  Didn't  Even  Know  What  He  Said  A  Balanced  Budget  Yeah  Well  A  Very  Different  Tone  In  The  Two  Cities  Very  Different  Let's  Say  Hi  To  Jason  In  New  York  We're  Going  To  Move  On  Other  Things  But  Jason  He's 
[01:39:30]  Been  Waiting  A  While  What's  Up  Buddy  Yeah  I  Just  Wanted  To  Comment  On  The  Stereotype  Issue  Yeah  I  Have  Two  Things  To  Say  First  Of  All  I  Think  We  Need  To  Stop  Focusing  So  Much  On  Stereotypes  Because  We  Have  A  Generation  That's  Raising  So  Sensitive  To  Everything  And  You  Know  They  Don't  Have  Any  Thick  Skin  The  Other  Thing  Is  I'm  100%  Italian  I'm  Not  Offended  At  All  By  The  Way  They  Put  On  The  Promotion  And  Actually  I  Think  They  Were  Doing  A  Good  Thing  They  Were  Bringing  Two  Groups 
[01:40:00]  Together  Italian  Americans  And  Blacks  Who  Have  Always  Collided  Always  Had  Conflict  And  They're  Bringing  Them  Together  On  A  Fun  Level  I  Really  Think  They  Were  Doing  A  Good  Thing  Yeah  See  It  Was  Like  Hey  Look  Look  Who  We're  Hanging  Out  With  That  Was  The  Point  We  Were  Trying  To  Make  Last  Do  You  Think  When  Those  Actors  Left  The  Set  That  They  Said  A  Few  Things  Oh  Of  Course  Both  Sides  By  The  Both  Sides  Yeah  Of  Course  It's  This  Commercial  Because  Boston  Doesn't  Get  It  Buffalo  Well  I  Think  It's  In  Buffalo 
[01:40:30]  Because  I  Think  It's  Statewide  New  York  State  Lottery  It's  Getting  The  The  Rap  Guys  Together  With  The  Soprano  Italian  Mobster  Guys  They  Weren't  Even  The  Sopranos  Guys  They  Were  Like  Lookalikes  Well  That's  What I  Meant  Yeah  And  They  Were  Promoting  This  New  Lottery  Ticket  Called  Bada  Bling  You  Got  The  Bada  And  You  Got  The  Bling  Bada  Bling  We  Thought  It's  Hilarious  Oh  By  The  Way  Let's  Get  This  Out  Of  The  Way  Tom  Tom  Hello  Tom  Tom  I 
[01:41:00]  Guess  He  Is  Dead  All  Right  I  Was  Trying  To  Help  People  Out  Because  We  We  The  Guy  Is  Basically  Dying  Of  A  Horrible  Lung  Thing  His  Lungs  Are  Slowly  But  Surely  Freezing  I  Think  Something  Is  Happening  Turning  Into  Stone  Slowly  Turning  Into  Stone  And  We  Blew  Off  The  Bit  Because  The  Freaking  Guy  Wouldn't  Die  On  Us  Old  Granite  Lungs  When  We  Start  Bits  The  Shelf  Life  Is  A  Couple  Month  But  The  Guy  Is  Still  Hanging  On 
[01:41:30]  And  We  Had  To  Give  Up  On  Tom's  Death  Maybe  He  Just  Couldn't  Breathe  Into  The  Phone  To  Even  Talk  I  Don't  Know  No  The  Guy  Kept  Calling  We  Just  Didn't  Have  Time  For  Him  Anymore  Because  The  Bit  Was  Getting  Boring  It's  A  Life  And  Death  Struggle  He's  Going  Through  Every  Day  But  For  Us  It  Was  Just  Another  Dumb  Bit  And  We  Couldn't  Waste  Any  More  Time  On  It  But  Then  The  Message  Boards  Went  Crazy  Like  Is  This  Tom  Guy  Alive  Yeah  Where  Is  He  Hasn't  Been  On  Well  Then  I  Thought  That  Was  Tom  But  No  One  Was  On  The  Other  End  So  I  Think  That  Could  Be  A  Fake  Tom  So  I  Don't  Know  I  Don't  Know  If  Tom's

[01:47:00]  Head  Brock Lesnar  Lost  By  The  Super  Bowl  Kind  Of  The  Super  Bowl  Took  A lot  Of  The  Old  Wrestling  Dude  Not  Old  But  From  The  WWF  Days  Went  Into  UFC  And  He  Lost  To  Frank  Mir  Did  He  Get  His  Ass  Handed  To  Him  Not  At  All  No  But  He  Made  A  Rookie  Mistakes  Where  Sam  I  Woke  Up  Yesterday  And  I  Went  Right  To  YouTube  I  Knew  Somebody  Would  Get 
[01:47:30]  It  Up  Got To  See  The 
[01:48:00]  Then  But  He  Left  And  He  Stood  Up  And  Was  Trying  Swinging  Down  You  Know  Yeah  And  He  Left  An  Ankle  Wide  Open  Frank  Mir  Just  Grabbed  His  Ankle  And  Twisted  Him  Because  Frank  Mir  Is  A  Submission  Expert  Oh  That's  Not  Good  That's  What  Frank  Yeah  Is  An  Expert  At  And  Basically  He  Was  Snap  Brock  Lesnar  Leg  And  Brock  Lesnar  Had  A  Oh  There  It  Is  There  It  Is  Jimmy  Oh  It  Is  Still  Up  On  YouTube  Oh  Wow  Okay  I mean  Mir  Was  Getting  Hit  Hard  Yeah  And  He  Was  On  The  Ground  Like  It  Looked  Like  Lesnar 
[01:48:30]  Was  Just  Knock  Him  Out  Who's  Who  Brock  The  The guy  Standing  Up  Yeah  But  Look  He  Grabbed  His  Ankle  Twisted  It  And  Now  He's  About  To  Break  It  He  Had  A  Tap  Tap  Done  So  That  Was  Basically  The guy  Getting  Hit  On  The  Ground  Frank  Mir  Frank  Can you  Go  Back  How  Long  Did  It  Take  Him  To  Beat  Him  Maybe  A  Minute  It  Isn't  The  First  Round  So  The guy  Being  On  His  Back  Is  Pretty  Much  On  His  Back  Strategically  Yeah  And  He's  Waiting  The  Whole  Time  And  He  Got  It  He  Just  Waited  For  That  Ankle  To  Get  Close  Enough  Lesnar  Got  Him  Down  Immediately  And 
[01:49:00]  Was  Punching  Him  Pretty  Good  But  Then  He  Made  The  Mistake  Of  Punching  Him  In  The  Back  Of  The  Head  Which  Is  An  Automatic  Point  Taken  Away  And  Then  You  Got  To  Break  Him  Up  And  Brock  Lesnar  Lost  His  Power  Position  He  Was  Hurting  Him  Pretty  Bad  Right  Off  The  Bat  Because  These  Guys  Can  Fight  From  The  Ground  Like  Frank  Mears  On  Punch  Him  On  The  Mat  And  I  Always  Wondered 
[01:49:30]  Why  He  Just  Gives  A  Couple  Of  Punches  And  Then  Backs  Off  And  It's  Probably  Just  Because  Of  That  You  Don't  Want  The  Guy  Grabbing  Your  Ankle  And  Twisting  It  Right  Now  He's  Looking  At  His  Ankle  He's  Like  Give  Me  That  Juicy  Little  Ankle  There  You  Got  It  You're  Tapping  You're  Not  Taking  This  Kind  Of  Pain  He's  Got  No  Submission  Defense  Training  No  I'm  Sure  He  Does  Tap  Yeah  Exactly  There  It  Is  Instantly  Stops  It  You  Could  See  Him  Looking  He  Just  Knew  He  It's  Like  A  Snake  Like 
[01:50:00]  When  He  Lunged  At  His  Ankle  It's  Like  A  Snake  When  You  See  Him  Go  For  A  Mouse  He  knew  That  Fast  He  He  Knew  Exactly  What  He  Was  Doing  Frank  Mir  He  Went  Right  For  Look  At  That  Ankle  He  Played  Peekable  With  Ankle  Gonna  Grab  That  Thing  Egon  What's  Your  Name  Sir  From  Jersey  Egon  Egon  What's  Up  He  Doesn't 
[01:50:30]  Even  Tap  You  Can't  Even  Blame  Brock  Lesnar  He  Wanted  To  Make  Sure  Frank  Mir  Knew  That  He  Was  Done  I  Think  He  Would  Have  Done  Something  With  Another  Part  Of  His  Body  Just  To  Get  Out  Of  That  Hole  I'm  Sure  Brock  Lesnar  Doesn't  Even  Have  A  Hint  Of  Gay  In  Him  But  He  Would  Absolutely  Do  That  To  Save  A  Broken  Ankle  He  Would  Have  Tapped  Another  Part  Of  His  Body  Into  His  Own  Tonsils  Yeah  It  Would  Have  Helped  Stop  That  Ankle  Twist  Oh  Yeah  I'd  Have  Tapped  Like him  Only  With  My  Thumb  Yeah  He's  The  Old  Thumb 
[01:51:00]  Tap  He's  Broken  A  Well  He'll  Still  Cause he  Was  I mean  For  The  First  30  Seconds  He  Was  Pretty  Impressive  Just  The  Fact  That  He  Took  Down  Frank  Mir  So  Quickly  Like  Nobody  Really  Expect  Him  To  Come  Straight  Out  And  Take  Him  Down  And  Start  Hitting  Him  So  I mean  He's  Not  Going to  Get  The  Title  Shot  Right  Away  Right  Because  People  Thought  If  He  Could  Beat  Frank  Mir  He'd  Go  For 
[01:51:30]  The  Heavy  Prove  Himself  Now  Exactly  Because  Now  The  Hype  Is  Gone  Now  He's  Learned  What  Are  They  Saying  Was  He  Impressive  In  The  Couple  Minutes  He  Was  In  There  He  Wasn't  Necessarily  Super  Impressive  But  He  Wasn't  Disappointing  Right  You know  What I  mean  Like  He  Seems  Like  He's  New  Like  That  Was  A  Rookie  Thing  But  He  Seems  Like  If  He  Were  To  Train  In  More  Jiu  Jitsu  And  Submission  Stuff  That  He  Could  Be  Pretty  Well  Versed  Because  He's  A  Good  Wrestler  Well  It's  Our  Line  Brock  Lesnar  UFC  Debut  Brian

[02:13:30]  calls  Mins  Can 
[02:14:00]  Do  You  L  Wh  dun  Thank you. 
[02:14:30]  Thank you. 
[02:15:00]  Thank you. 
[02:15:30]  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you. 
[02:16:30]  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  I'm so happy.  You're getting rid of your iPhone?  No, I'm going to keep it and keep my number because the AT&T reception has gotten slightly better. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  But the inconsistency of it is mind-bending.  And when that call got dropped, hello, hello.  Wait, you're not really explaining, though.  You had a really important call.  Yeah.  On a Friday afternoon.  And I talked to them in the cab, and they're like, I'll call you back in 10 minutes.  So I walk into my apartment, and I hear hello.  I'm like, hello, hello, hello.  Oh, oh.  And I looked at the fucking phone.  It went boop, boop.  Yeah, that little...  Which my call dropped.  I hate that sound.  And I hear it every time I use the phone in my apartment. 
[02:18:00]  Because it's, you know, it's somewhere in Beirut.  Oh, sorry.  That's the west side of Manhattan.  Sorry.  Not many people live there, though.  And, you know, fucking didn't work again, man.  I can't tell you the anger I felt when it got dropped.  I mean, like, Verizon, there's places, like, on 6th Avenue, my calls will always get dropped.  There's certain places that are dead zones for sale.  Yeah.  But Verizon just...  Look, I have no interest in Verizon at all.  They get coverage fucking everywhere.  I'm sorry.  Yeah. 
[02:18:30]  They do.  So you got a BlackBerry now?  No, I didn't have time.  Believe me, I want...  If there was another comedian in just hanging all this, you wouldn't have fucking seen old  Jimmy Norton until 930.  You would have just like...  I would have been known as the BlackBerry kid.  I need to get my BlackBerry.  Is that a BlackBerry there?  Yeah.  I'm getting pretty much the same one.  Yeah, but it's really tough to do email on this with the double tag.  I never use email.  I hate the fucking...  Oh, then you'll be fine.  What about textuses?  I'll take the double-click texting.  It's a little more annoying.  Like, the iPhone had a really good text system.  Love the iPhone's text. 
[02:19:00]  I'll take that and know that I'm not going to get a fucking error message.  Every time I try and text.  Or I'm not going to get a call dropped.  You know what?  I'll take the important call and I'll be the fucking double-click kid.  And I'll take a photo of my cock and I'll text it for whoever wants one.  Here's a cock photo.  Ka-ching!  I can't do that with certain phones.  No, you can't.  That's upsetting.  I don't like the fact that you can't text a photo with the iPhone.  Figure that out.  They haven't.  They haven't figured it out. 
[02:19:30]  Of course they do.  They just didn't do it on purpose.  Next generation.  Yeah.  California, what's up?  Hi, guys.  Hey.  O.B., do you think that maybe it wasn't that your curse might be gone and it was just  when Fez jumped on the bandwagon and bet against Tommy Z, that might have screwed you all up?  Because you weren't offseason until he backed them.  Well, I really thought that whole dumb sports curse bit we've been doing was long gone.  But as soon as the Pats lost, the message boards went nuts.  And then I started thinking, I guess it was all leading up to the biggest disappointment in Super Bowl history for a team. 
[02:20:00]  Do you think that if Eli would have lost, he would kill himself?  Eli, no.  He was just happy to be there.  If he would have lost the Super Bowl, you don't think that he would have fucking lost his mind?  Not at all, man.  But he...  Because of his dad and the...  And the expectations?  I know this girl just keeps talking.  No, basically, no.  The Giants weren't even supposed to be in the Super Bowl.  They were the wild card.  Although they played great on the road, they, what, 11 straight victories on the road.  And they said Eli was the best quarterback in the playoffs, so... 
[02:20:30]  Can I tell Bob Kelly this?  The way you feel today about the Patriots is the way everyone in your life feels about you.  Just saddened and let down.  Disappointment.  And it's a whole mouthful of what could have been.  That call was...  That call was quite real, too, man.  Of course it was.  Yeah.  Bob wasn't playing.  He really loves his past.  He's very upset.  And speaking of the Bob Kelly phone call, we really need to make Speedy Aids the top 
[02:21:00]  Google search of the day.  Brazilian Speedy Aids.  Brazilian?  That's the problem.  That's why I went with just Speedy Aids.  All right.  Speedy Aids is good.  Let's just go Speedy Aids, because a lot of people will fuck up our whole thing with  trying to spell Brazilian.  So it's Speedy Aids.  Two words.  Speedy, of course.  S-P-E-E-D-Y.  All right?  Speedy Aids.  Start Googling that.  Like crazy.  Like crazy.  Okay, guys.  Did you like the game, Deanna?  Yeah, it was very good. 
[02:21:30]  I don't normally watch football, but it was good.  Except I don't understand the whole hesitation thing with Eli.  I never watched him play before.  Why does he stop?  He, like, thinks too much before he throws the ball.  He throws too hard, too, at times.  And it goes way up.  I don't know.  He's just...  You know what?  I don't think he wants to play football.  You're right, miss.  That was a good indicator.  MVP of the Super Bowl.  You really can't pick a good psychological profiler.  Yeah, he just did that because it's his hobby.  No, I think he does it because of the expectations. 
[02:22:00]  He just doesn't look happy.  Miss, get a hold of yourself.  She can't.  Miss, just settle down.  He doesn't know how to be happy.  His father raised him to be a Super Bowl MVP.  That's all he knows.  Two of them.  Yeah.  But, you know, there's a third son in the middle.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Probably Chip Manning.  And he works with a...  Oh, Deanna, shut up.  She loves to talk, this girl.  I love you guys.  Thank you.  And I remember why we don't put you on the show often because you just keep babbling 
[02:22:30]  over what we're trying to do.  Yeah, Deanna, conversate.  Deanna, we have to talk to each other.  Like, you talk and then I talk and then Ope talks and then you talk.  And then Sam talks and then Erod talks and we all talk over him.  Well, sometimes you guys start talking to each other and I'm scared you're going to forget  about me.  We're not going to forget about you, Deanna.  How could we?  How could we?  You're a lovely vision in the morning.  I love you guys.  We love you, but we just wish that you would chit-chat with us.  Yeah, you're just babbling.  My boyfriend does, too. 
[02:23:00]  He hates it.  He says I talk to you.  All right.  That's enough.  That's all I want to hear.  Hey, Anthony.  What?  Do you have a hangover?  No, not really.  I'm tired, but I stuck to beer.  If I would have cracked open that bottle of wine, it would have been hell to pay, but  I was actually thinking.  Did the little threesome thing ever work out for you?  I was listening to the show yesterday.  Well, the Giants winning, there was a bet, and Lily from the Ron and Fez show now has  to spend the night over at my house. 
[02:23:30]  Can I come?  Um, no.  Why?  Because you're a cock-blocking douchebag.  Oh.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  I would be, too.  Of course you would.  I'd be there in my little feety pajamas going, you know, Lily, you don't want to do that.  Would you wear your feety pajamas with the hatch in the back so I could just open up the  two little snaps and fuck you in the ass?  No, I'd turn it backwards so I could just jerk off while all three of you were trying  to talk in your bedroom.  And I could just whack my bag.  And you'd see my face poking through and my fucking cock head. 
[02:24:00]  Like when Jim Florentine first started dating Jade years ago, they were sitting in his office  and I lived with Jim.  And the office was like down the hall from the bathroom.  And Jim is standing up and she's sitting in his office chair and she's blowing him.  And I'm fucking jerking off in the bathroom, peeking out the door.  And fucking Jade looked over and saw me and she went, ooh!  And I was like, ah, sorry.  Sorry, I'm just.  Oh, that's great.  Like a fucking monkey.  Like a monkey.  I was like one of those things you order in the back of a comic book, throw water on  it and it jerks off. 
[02:24:30]  When's the big sleepover?  I don't know.  We got to figure out timing stuff.  Is it going to be on cam?  Are you going to be on PalTalk?  I think PalTalk might get the privilege of peering into my house and seeing what's going on.  If you do have sex with Lily, please only say her name like Herman Munster.  Lily!  Lily!  Like, talk normal until you say her name.  Like, oh, I just.  Now, Lily.  Get in the bed, Lily. 
[02:25:00]  Grandpa!  All right, Deanna.  Thank you.  That would be hysterical.  Yeah, just talk like Herman, will you, fucker?  What's up, Andrew?  Hey, boys.  How's it going?  Hi.  Hey, I just want to let you know, Opie, the first thing I thought as soon as the Giants won  that game was fucking Opie.  Yep.  Yeah.  A lot of people.  Because I suited up for the game.  Yeah.  How many fumbles did you have? 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, because I was on the front line, you know, protecting Tom Brady.  Hey, look, I thought the same thing.  Holy shit, there's Kevin Kirscher.  Kevin, you gotta, like, wake up a little earlier.  There's, I don't know, over and over and over again.  We're not acknowledging your instant feedback because we covered it already, you douchebag.  Terry Bradshaw threw out the F-bomb on live TV.  We didn't.  He did not.  We went over that whole thing about two hours ago.  That's right.  He said cunt lip, not fuck.  Ah, there you go.  Shut up.  All right, Andrew. 
[02:26:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  I hear we have audio of Danny who didn't make it into work today.  We're still procuring it.  Yeah, because last night, of course, Ron and Fez were doing their broadcast during the big game.  And I stopped in.  Did a lot of fun.  And then took some phone calls after the game was over.  And Danny called in.  He was hammered.  He was in the spirit of the game.  We're trying to locate it.  If you have any pertinent info that would help. 
[02:26:30]  No, it was just one of the calls that were taken.  After the game?  After the game.  Okay.  So it was the last, maybe somewhere in the last 20 minutes of the show.  We got somebody pouring through.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Hey, can I do an impression?  Just listen for a big, long slur.  That'll show up in the waveform.  Make sure it's not me.  And then.  Did someone do an explosion sound?  You'll know when to do it.  Oh.  You'll know when to do it if you got it on the thing.  Please hold. 
[02:27:00]  Just an impression I want to do.  We got a good one.  I think we do have a really good one.  Sorry.  Couldn't wait.  Can't wait to get my Verizon phone.  That's exciting.  I'm so happy.  John from Michigan.  What about the Conan O'Brien prediction?  He had the turtle race and the Giants won by a nose.  Really?  Yeah.  He predicted it with a turtle race.  Wow.  Get back to work, writers.  Write a big, I hope this is it.  Okay.  I'll tell you when to do it.  You'll see my finger.  Okay.  Day! 
[02:27:30]  Oh.  Hello, Iraq.  Okay.  Oh, God.  I like her finger in the polish.  Oh, God.  Do it quick.  She's drooling.  The bomb is getting wet.  Oh, shit.  Fucking dunderheads.  What a fucking...  Run!  It is Pete Rose! 
[02:28:00]  Two mentally retarded women strapped with remote control explosives, of course, because they  would not have pulled it at the right time.  What we used is unwitting suicide bombers.  Witless would have been more accurate.  Here's what they've gotten down to in Iraq.  Retarded, uh, retarded women.  Yeah.  And they, uh...  A misguided missile. 
[02:28:30]  I am the werewolf.  I like to make werewolf movies.  I like turtles.  My name is William, and I like fingernail polish.  Yeah, they, uh...  My name is William, and I like to wear dresses. 
[02:29:00]  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen...  Goodness gracious!  The one...  The one...  Goodness gracious!  The one bomber's just standing there with a...  With a...  A throw rug on her head.  The other one's eating the wires.  Dan D. from Fargo, the Iraqis haven't quite mastered the smart bomb yet.  Yeah.  That's hilarious. 
[02:29:30]  Their, uh...  The theories are they're running out of willing men to do this.  Uh, or they've just found that the men are better used for, um, you know, repeat terrorism  and, and, uh, shenanigans and hijinks that they do over there.  They're shooting and bombings and stuff like that.  So they're using, uh, disposable people, as they say, uh, to put bombs on them, walk  them into a crowd, and remotely detonate it, and blow them up. 
[02:30:00]  But why do they trust them to pull it themselves?  Well, come on.  They've probably come back.  What, am I supposed to do this?  No!  Blow them up.  I'm a vest, mate.  Yeah.  Here's a vest, stupid.  Walk over there into that marketplace.  Was she behaving suspiciously?  Uh, yeah, she was reading a book.  We knew there was something wrong.  They, uh, they didn't know that it was a woman bomber, uh, until they found the head, 
[02:30:30]  they said.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Yeah, that was all they found was the head.  And the big tongue.  That's probably where the bomb was.  It was under the tongue.  Like a fucking nitroglycerin.  They took one of these, uh, uh, retarded women.  She had Down syndrome.  And, um, she worked in this, is it called a pet market?  Or a, most of them are birds.  They just, for some reason, they sell fucking birds there.  Yeah.  And she was the, she was the bird brain of the outfit. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  Killed two birds with one stone.  Bird brains with one stone.  Oops.  John, North Carolina.  What's up?  Yeah, buddy.  Hey.  Hey.  Is, uh, she gonna get 40 points added to her IQ in heaven?  Pretty funny.  They, uh, yeah, she, she worked there.  Uh, and they rigged her up with a bomb.  And then she said, hey, I'm selling birds.  So a bunch of people gathered around her.  I guess it was a cut rate price and everything. 
[02:31:30]  They all gathered around her.  And, uh, then they remote detonated.  That is unbelievable.  How annoying is it when you realize you've been duped by a retard?  A retard has gotten you.  Let's go to Chris in New York.  Chris?  Hey, these guys have been doing this for a while.  When I was in Iraq in, uh, 2004, they, they were using retarded people.  This is, this is nothing new.  They, they, they have to go find people to trick them into blowing people up.  I mean, this is new.  Nothing new for these guys.  Yeah, really.  Freedom fighters, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  They, when I was there in 2004, they took a guy and told him, hey, drive this truck from, 
[02:32:00]  uh, point A to point B and drive, make sure you drive by this hospital.  We want you to just drive by it.  And when they went by the hospital, he blew it up.  Oh, wow.  I had no idea.  Yeah, well, he survived.  They don't even know.  Yeah, well, he got blown out the front window and he had no idea.  I'm here.  Wait, he didn't know what, he lived?  Yeah, he lived.  Of course.  He got blown out through the front windows of the truck and they, they picked him up.  And when they interrogated the guy, he had no idea what was going on.  He said, oh, I just told to drive this truck.  And they think, you know, boom.  I always wondered about that. 
[02:32:30]  I, I, I always thought there's no way all these people are willing to, you know, blow  themselves up for Allah.  So I bet you they're like this, uh, incident, they're tricking a lot of people into doing  their dirty work.  Here's some ice cream, you know, to drive this truck.  Maybe some guy just trying to make a few bucks, a few, whatever they're called over there and  said, all right, there, drive this.  Yeah.  A few clits.  Drive this truck for us.  The dreaded PHB is the acronym the, uh, the army's using the puddin' head bomb. 
[02:33:00]  Let's go to Carl in Jersey.  Carl, what's up?  Hey, it's a win-win for the Iraqis.  They sent out the gene pool and they get to kill some people on the same day, you know?  It's for, it's, it's disgusting.  Yeah, they're not very good.  We really shifted gears on that one.  I hear you, man.  All right.  We go to Philly.  Kevin, what's up?  Hey, uh, most victims were killed by flying pennies and marbles.  I don't know.  Jesus. 
[02:33:30]  Just whatever it had eaten over the course of its life.  Please, everyone, end your calls with that.  Oh, she's calling today?  Cool.  Is she calling back?  Yeah, tomorrow's Super Tuesday, so, uh, you know, we get only the best, uh, political  guests out there.  We got, uh, Donna, uh, from Baywatch fame.  I need, uh...  We didn't get her when she was popular and hot.  We get her now.  That's wonderful.  This, nothing but the best for this, uh, radio show.  It's not your normal run-of-the-mill, uh, ex-has-been star interview. 
[02:34:00]  She's a big fan of Ron Paul.  A lot of people love, uh, this Ron Paul, but he doesn't have a shot in hell.  No, not at all.  Doesn't have a shot.  Hey, uh, moving backwards, by the way, the Manning brother that's not playing football, this  is a bummer, born in 74, what's his name, Cooper Manning, uh, only Manning brother not  playing professional football, works as an oil and gas trader in New Orleans, was diagnosed  with spinal stenosis in 1992, which ended his hopes as a professional football player. 
[02:34:30]  That's got to be nice.  So he had every intention of playing football as well, and, uh, and what is, uh, spinal,  what is this spinal stenosis?  I do not know.  I don't know, but I...  Did we look it up?  Bet you can't be an MVP of a Super Bowl with it.  He's an oil trader, though.  He's probably making enough money.  Yeah, but...  Yeah, but you gotta think, you know.  When you're sitting there at Thanksgiving dinner, while they're all carving the turkey,  talking about...  With those huge Super Bowl rings on their fingers, and, uh, yeah, he's there going,  yeah, hey, you seen that price of oil?  Yeah. 
[02:35:00]  I'm making a few bucks on that.  Let me tell you that, uh, I know how to trade.  Two Super Bowl MVPs, and he's been deep-dicking the country for an extra $20 a barrel, fucking  rapist.  Uh, what do we know about spinal stenosis?  Uh, just that it's a condition due to narrowing of the spinal cord, causing nerve pinching,  which leads to persistent pain in the buttocks, limping, lack of feeling in the lower extremities,  and decreased physical activity.  It's a homosexual, uh, disease?  You're a stenosis. 
[02:35:30]  And a child must have...  Yeah, you gotta be careful.  You gotta get checked for that young.  Uh, let's go to Sean in Michigan.  Sean, what's up?  Hey, there's Sean.  Shawnee.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, that retard survived that truck blast, because he had his white retard helmet on.  All right.  For the ronkis!  All right, so that's not going to help, uh, whether...  That's very funny.  That's, uh...  That's just mean-spirited.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We like to tease those silly geese, but in the spirit of fun, right? 
[02:36:00]  Brian from St. Louis.  I'm going to get a lot of it.  He's a faithful.  He writes,  Hey, Opa, the retard, uh, the retard training program ran into some problems  when the drooling kept shorting out the first version of the bomb.  Tell him to thank you for repeating my joke on...  Yes.  What the hell?  I wish...  That was Jimmy's...  They said the last thing the retarded girl said before she blew up was,  How are ya?  Yeah.  There you go.  All right, quick break, and we're going to get Donna on the phone?  Don.  Oh, Donna.  Donna Derrico from Baywatch fame to talk about Ron Paul.  This should be really interesting. 
[02:36:30]  I mean, it will be, right?  Oh, of course.  Yeah.  Why not?  I'm going to hear what, uh, what she says about this guy.  Why is she supporting him?  What does he stand for?  Why isn't she supporting Obama?  Yeah, we'll find out all those, um, answers after the break.  And maybe, you never know, Steve from Yellowstone, eh.  Maybe a Ramon.  Ooh.  What?  Ramon, you know, that guy that calls from time to time.  Oh, I hope he is an expert on politics.  He's that guy that puts all that stuff in his hiney, right? 
[02:37:00]  Mine hiney?  In mine hiney?  Isn't that Ramon?  And, you know, I think today we'll do...  I get all those characters confused.  We'll do serious questions only from the phone lines.  Is he the gay guy that talks like he likes girls' tits?  No.  No?  We'll have it after break.  Damn, I always get those guys confused.  All right, serious questions on the phone.  Brilliant characters.  And we got Danny, uh, Danny audio.  Oh, you found it?  Yeah.  Nice.  I just ate four burritos and drank a pot of coffee.  Anyone for trouser chili?  Oh, God damn.  Ugh. 
[02:37:30]  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  The M&M Show.  Oh, God.  Oh, yeah.  Don and Terrico calling the show in a few minutes here.  She's stumping for Ron Paul.  Oprah's back on the campaign trail.  She's stumping for Obama.  What a surprise. 
[02:38:00]  And no one is stomping, stomping, stomping for, uh, Hillary.  Except Bill.  Except our husband.  Bill.  That's a biggie, though.  Yeah.  He's still effective.  Is she calling back?  Are we up to the wafer?  Do we have time to get the Danny audio in?  Yes.  I'd recommend that.  Our own Danny, uh, cold and sick today.  Big day.  We're all kind of tired and just kind of groggy.  It, uh, it's a late night Super Bowl Sunday. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  And then you gotta go to work.  Well, there's no way around it because you can't even, you can't even, like, go to bed early like we usually do.  Because you gotta be informed about the Super Bowl, so it's a no-win situation.  You gotta know what's going on.  We have to get up really early.  4.15.  And, uh.  And Danny called in sick today.  It's rough.  There was one of the, one of the doormen at my building called in sick yesterday.  And, oh, man, that has caused a bit of a, bit of a problem in my building.  A bit of a row? 
[02:39:00]  Oh, my God.  This guy, uh, Sam, who's a really cool guy.  I'm like, Sam, uh, are you gonna be able to, you know, get out of here for the Super Bowl?  He goes, no, because Blah Blah called in sick.  What a dumb name.  Right.  You think you gotta tell people his name.  But what a dick move because obviously the guy isn't sick.  He called in sick so he could enjoy the Super Bowl.  And now this, this guy that wasn't working, that was gonna enjoy the Super Bowl, had a, you know, cover for this douche.  Amazing.  Uh, let's say hi to Danny. 
[02:39:30]  Danny!  Hello, fellas.  How are you?  Well, better now than I was at 4 in the morning.  Ah, what's going on?  Uh, nothing.  I'm shitting liquid fire into my toilet.  That's about it.  The old food poisoning, huh?  Nah, I don't know what it was, but whatever I, all the shit that I was eating yesterday made me, made me very nauseous and shit liquid.  Was it the cream cheese salsa and cheese?  It was probably an onion dip.  Probably wasn't such a great combo. 
[02:40:00]  Uh, it was good stuff.  I had everything.  Wasn't the, I didn't have the taco salad, though.  No.  No.  It wasn't the beers?  No, I don't think so.  No.  Beers are easy.  Yeah.  It's when you mix them.  That's child's play.  Once you start mixing shit, like I said, thank God I didn't crack open that bottle of wine.  Word over.  Dave, Eastside Dave was drinking, uh, Jameson. 
[02:40:30]  Ouch.  And, um, Pitsy was drinking, uh, Jameson.  And at the end of the night, Pitsy insisted that, uh, my girlfriend punch him in the face as hard as she could.  So I put it on Pal Talk, and she wound up, and it was like Fight Club.  The first time she punched him, she hit him right in the ear.  Like a fucking ear, man.  She didn't know, like, and she's like, oh, I missed you.  The second time it was like, hit him in the jowl. 
[02:41:00]  Jesus.  And then after like five times of really clocking him with a fist, and really like, as much as she can, winding up and punching him, hit him square in the jaw.  Who?  Pitsy from Ron and Feather Show.  Because he was just drunk.  My girlfriend.  Just, because he said, punch me in the face.  Because him and Dave, I'm sitting here, and, uh, Pitsy and Dave got in, like, a little shouting match, and then a fight.  And Pitsy leans over and punches Dave square in the nose. 
[02:41:30]  Like, really hard.  Just pops him in the nose.  And Dave's like, ah, you fuck!  And, and gave him body punches to where I think he was pissing blood.  And then, Pitsy punched Dave again right in the side of the face.  Like, real hard fucking punches.  They're animals when they, uh, they get a few in them.  Very entertaining to watch, though.  I was laughing my ass off watching two drunks just beat each other up.  That's, that's a good, uh, good time.  And all, all I had to do to stop it was, was go, guys, why can't you just celebrate the victory that the Giants had, and, and appreciate that together? 
[02:42:00]  The second I said that, they went, come here, dude, come here, and just started hugging each other.  Unbelievable.  Hey, uh, we got audio of Danny playing Ron, uh, calling Ron and Fez last night.  We got Danny from the ONA show.  Danny.  Hey, Danny.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, Danny boy.  Hey, babe.  Well, I guess Z-Man won the bet.  Mm-hmm.  He did indeed.  And I'm gonna have to give him his fucking Saturday Night Violent show, I guess.  Oh, that's so drunk. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, he does.  Well, it is a day ending in a Y.  Danny, you were hammered last night.  And I'm gonna have to give him a Saturday Night Violent show.  I didn't hear that over the phone.  Oh, that's all right.  It was pretty good.  You probably wouldn't, wouldn't want to.  You were a little tipsy.  I, uh, remember calling and trying to, to get, uh, Z-Man his, uh, his viral show for winning  the big, the big Super Bowl bet.  Who wasn't a little tipsy, though? 
[02:43:00]  Right?  I mean, come on.  So, basically, I'm being accused of calling out sick because I was a drunk.  Who said that?  We didn't say that.  That seems to be the accusation, Ply.  No.  Not one person said that.  It was the onion dip.  Uh, yes.  Could have very well been the onion dip.  I hope I have another gallon of shit so I can take a picture of it for you guys.  Ply, that, no.  You, your camera's full of enough shit. 
[02:43:30]  That's what he does, though.  When he has guests over the house, he'll just show them shit pictures.  It's like my family.  He's got a great one that's a backwards R.  And it's perfect.  I'm pretty proud of my saxophone.  All right, Danny.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We got Donna calling in right now.  Awesome.  We just want to check in with you.  Okay.  All right, Danny, everyone.  All right, Danny.  Take it easy.  And, uh, is she ready to go?  A couple seconds.  A couple seconds?  Why?  Just doing another interview? 
[02:44:00]  We don't know.  Mmm, smoothie.  Huh?  Good stuff.  Donna D'Erico, where is she?  Come on.  Come on.  Talk to us about, where did my paper go about her candidate?  Oh, I have it.  I just had it.  Why the fuck?  I'm trying to look up some information on Ron Paul.  But I wanted, okay, thank you.  We'll let her give all the info.  Ron Paul.  Let's just make unbelievable experts on Ron Paul.  Let's see.  The war. 
[02:44:30]  Mm-hmm.  Bush.  Mm-hmm.  Moving forward.  Immigration.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  All right, that's crazy.  That's crazy.  That's insane.  That's stupid.  Stupid.  Let's just strap a bomb to yourself, stupid.  Let's see.  That's.  Don't ask, don't tell.  On hate crimes.  Okay, let's see.  Hey, Donna.  Hello.  Hello.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  How are you?  Oh, I'm great.  How are you guys? 
[02:45:00]  Good, good.  Super Tuesday is tomorrow, and what, you're trying to get people to vote for Ron Paul?  Is that the deal?  I sure am.  That's who I'm going to vote for.  Now, I'm an expert on Ron Paul.  I've been studying this guy big time.  Really?  Yeah, I love Ron Paul.  I love him, too.  I think if people would wake up, you know, they would understand that this guy could easily  run this country, and a lot of people would be very, very satisfied by his job.  Now, for the people out there that don't know, what is Ron Paul all about?  Well, gosh, it's hard to say in, you know, one sentence, as you know. 
[02:45:30]  Used to.  Oh, my God, yeah.  I mean, where do you begin with this Ron Paul guy, you know?  Really, you know, for me, anyway, it's he just, the fact that he is so hardcore for  the Constitution, that's what won me over initially and got me interested in him, and I started  researching him like you did.  And just all of the stances on all of the various issues, I agree with everything. 
[02:46:00]  I mean, there's some candidates that people are wanting to vote for that they're like,  well, I like this and I like this.  I don't agree with everything, but I like them overall.  I like everything about Ron Paul.  How about his anti-abortion stance?  I like that, too.  I mean, I'm for that, too.  Okay.  How about the right to bear arms, wanting to pull.  And the border security issue is quite interesting, right?  Sorry?  The border security thing.  Yeah, I'm for that, too.  I know that there's, I don't know how, you know, widely known it is, but, you know, they're 
[02:46:30]  wanting to sort of erase the borders between Canada and Mexico and the U.S., and I don't  want that.  No.  And neither does he, and I don't think most of America would want that either.  Yeah, that leads to the immigration overhaul that he's for.  Yes.  And, you know, look, I am just like him.  I want our nation's sovereignty back, and I want the U.S. to be the way that it used 
[02:47:00]  to be.  And we were independent.  In the 50s or something, yes.  If you wanted to get into the country, if you wanted to come live in America, it was a  hard, difficult process to get in.  I like the way you think.  I like that.  Keep it the way.  Yeah.  Because now you go, you know, Southern California, a lot of illegal immigrants in there.  You can get in.  You can just, you can come over whenever you want.  And, you know, and also, we're starting to have to support them, too. 
[02:47:30]  Illegal.  Yes.  I'm not okay with that.  I don't want to pay for that.  What's Ron Paul saying about that?  Well, he doesn't want that either.  Good.  He's very pro-American and pro-Constitution.  Yeah.  We got a lot of calls coming in, a lot of Ron Paul support.  I didn't mean to interrupt you there, but these people have been chomping at the bit.  I've been promoting the whole Ron Paul thing all morning, because I'm like, it's about  time.  We've got to get the word out on this Ron Paul guy. 
[02:48:00]  Yay.  And I knew Donna Derrico from Baywatch would do a fine job with that.  And we got Steve from Yellowstone on the phone.  Steve, you're talking to Donna.  Hi, Donna.  How are you?  Oh, great.  How are you, Steve?  Hello.  Hi.  I can't really hear.  Can you hear me?  I can hear you.  Oh, I hope so.  Oh, Donna, can you hear me?  I can hear you.  Go ahead.  I cannot hear her at all.  This connection is messed up.  And apparently at the office, we don't have people who are going to help us when we're calling  in. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, that's a shame, because...  Hold on.  I'm very apologetic.  I'm trying to turn the volume up on the phone.  I don't know why it's not...  Maybe Don Wicklund can help, unless he's waxing his chest.  He wouldn't be doing...  Yeah, that's right.  Okay, why would anybody help, because I'm standing here like an idiot on hold.  I guess I'll just stand here and continue to talk.  I can't hear you.  I can hear you.  Jericho.  Yeah, I think the...  There's something wrong with the phones?  There's something wrong with the phone.  But we have so many callers that want to talk about Ron and... 
[02:49:00]  I'll call back.  Talk to you.  God.  Maybe if he calls back, that'll be...  Now, Donna, obviously...  You're...  Fucking phone while I'm on hold like that?  I'm on hold.  Wow.  I can hear that.  Holy fucking shit.  Uh-oh.  You can hear what?  Somebody's cursing on the air.  Nice.  Who is?  I don't know.  I just heard that previous caller, perhaps.  Hello.  I was a little upset. 
[02:49:30]  Hello.  Hello.  Can you hear me, Donna?  I can hear you fine.  Oh, okay.  I couldn't hear you.  I'm sorry.  I was yelling because my office phone, because that was how I executed produce, and I couldn't  get the office phone working.  How are you today?  I'm really good.  How are you?  Okay.  Do you like the fact that he was a gynecologist?  Does that make you feel like he might be a little bit more in tune with women's issues?  Well, at least he'll be more in tune with health issues, and, you know, the... 
[02:50:00]  RABBONE!  Tell this self-hating hooker to shut her cake hole!  What?  RABBONE!  I don't want to elect any man whose fingers smell like a tuna can!  Hello?  RABBONE! 
[02:50:30]  I want to put Ron Paul in my hiney!  Donna?  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah, I don't know what happened there, Donna.  I'll continue.  What was that all about?  I don't know.  That guy was obviously a problem.  RABBONE!  I'd rather vote for a retarded Iraqi with a nail bomb strapped to her tongue! 
[02:51:00]  All right, look.  This is not the time or place for this.  Donna, I'm very sorry about that.  It's a problem with the phones.  Well, all I'd like to say is that I'd like to ask everybody to go out and vote in their primary or their caucus tomorrow.  Absolutely.  Yeah, absolutely.  And Ron Paul looks like, you know, a viable candidate, a candidate for the times, one we need right now.  I think this is true change that we're talking about with someone like Ron Paul and not this fake, like the Democrats are preaching about this change and everything. 
[02:51:30]  We need to get back to basics.  Right.  I think.  And Ron Paul is a candidate that is, like you said, for the Constitution, for the basics, things that I think this country has forgotten about.  Yeah, what do you say to the people that say that Ron Paul doesn't even have a shot, so why vote for him tomorrow?  Well, I think he has a very good shot. 
[02:52:00]  He's really not showing up on any of the...  Well, it's early.  What, the polls and stuff?  Yeah, the polls and stuff.  It's still until Super Tuesday, you know.  Well, I mean, I think that the people need to try to take back control of the vote and their government.  And I don't think that a candidate's chances should influence somebody's vote.  Well, when Ron Paul's knocked out, are you going to vote for John McCain or... 
[02:52:30]  I'm not expecting that that's going to happen.  Well, when it does, you've still got to vote as an American, don't you think?  So, would it be, like, who do you like better, Obama or Clinton?  You know what?  I don't like it.  Oh, those two?  Please, right?  All right, hold on.  We're going to try this again.  We've got some serious questions coming in.  We've got Paul from New York.  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul, you're on with Donna.  Hello?  Hello?  Hi, Uncle Paul.  Hey.  Hi, how are you?  Can you hear me?  I think the last caller was right. 
[02:53:00]  There's something wrong with the phone line.  It seems like something's going on, but you have a question for Donna.  Yeah, because it seems like I'm very involved in children's interests.  And it seems like Ron Paul has the No Child Left Behind initiative.  And when I was working at the McMartin Preschool,  I got very interested in the children's issues.  Do you feel his stance on that is accurate or no, Mr. Errico? 
[02:53:30]  His stance on what?  The No Child Left Behind law.  You know what?  I don't know.  I don't know.  That's a big one for Ron Paul.  Yeah, it's a big one for him, Adam.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  I don't know.  And I know you're mentioning the McMartin Peace School.  I don't know.  Ron Paul has more of a child fetish than John Wayne's daisy. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, my God.  Someone's getting fired today, Donna.  I'm sorry for that.  Donna?  Yeah, the phone screeners, obviously.  Letting that guy through today.  Scrolling up. 
[02:54:30]  I will apologize.  A lot of people, Donna, a lot of people are very emotional about who they're going to vote for.  Obviously, that's a Giuliani fan.  Well, you know what?  I'm going to have to go, but I just one more time want to ask everybody to go out and vote tomorrow in their primary.  Are you all right?  Thank you guys very much.  Yes.  No, I just have another one coming up.  Oh, okay.  I appreciate you guys having me on.  But we're big fans.  We're big fans.  You all right?  Thank you.  Yeah, I'm great.  Thank you.  You don't sound okay.  I'm great.  Let's smooth things over here. 
[02:55:00]  I apologize.  I don't know.  Yeah, I have some issues with the phone.  I have another phoner that's coming up.  Oh, damn.  It's been a little bit long.  But thank you guys very much, and I hope everybody goes out and votes tomorrow.  For Ron Paul.  For Ron Paul.  You sound upset, though.  Thank you, guys.  Donna, you sound upset.  I'm not at all.  I'm just a little pressed because I have some other phone interviews.  Very busy.  Very busy.  Thank you very much.  This is a big.  Do you know Ron Paul voted against the No Child Left Behind? 
[02:55:30]  I didn't realize it.  Yeah, of course we didn't.  Uncle Paul was busy.  Uncle Paul was a little busy at the McMartin preschool when you said that.  Uncle Paul couldn't hear shit.  I was done with the phone lines, I think, because you can't hear.  Funniest part.  You can't hear her.  You're on the phone.  You want to get help.  Opie comes in to help.  The phone is still going out over the air, and you're going, why can't we get a fucking  phone that works in it?  Dude, because no one was helping me.  Hysterical.  And I'm like, we have the guest on hold, and all of a sudden the office was empty, 
[02:56:00]  and I'm standing here with a phone.  I can't hear anything, and nobody came in.  I can't hear, god damn it.  It was great, though, because you're just cursing, and I'm like, I don't know what  that is.  That's how I knew you could still hear me.  Fuck shit.  You sounded really depressed at the end of that.  Oh, yeah.  Let's go to Steve in Connecticut.  Steve, what's going on?  Hello.  Hey, Steve.  I'm actually a big fan of you guys.  Uh-oh.  I was disappointed.  It was a couple weeks ago when Anthony, you guys were playing the campaign songs, and 
[02:56:30]  Anthony said something about, made a little offhand comment about those Ron Paul weirdos  or something.  Right.  Did I?  Yeah, I was a little under the breath.  I hope he had mentioned Ron Paul a couple times.  He was actually advertising on XM and 202 on your station.  I swear to you, I don't remember saying a bad word or a good word about that guy.  I thought exactly what the word was.  It was like kooks or something, and there definitely are some passionate kooks for Ron Paul,  but a lot of the guys who are friends with your show, like Joe Rogan, Penn Jillette, 
[02:57:00]  even John Mayer, have all said positive things about him.  Good for them.  That's terrific, but I got to tell you.  But he doesn't have a shot in hell, unfortunately.  Reading this one sheet, dude.  The whole thing is rigged.  It really is.  I'm reading this one sheet.  Dude, get a hold of yourself.  I'm reading this one sheet on him, and I agree with the partial birth abortion ban, but  like, you know, he wants the states to be able to ban abortion.  You know, he's just a fucking arch-conservative, it seems.  He's not. 
[02:57:30]  He's a libertarian, Jimmy.  Listen, listen.  I've seen you live, Jimmy.  I own your DVDs.  All right.  Okay, well, then I'm voting for Ron Paul.  That's a threat.  I'm just telling you.  I'm not a plant.  I didn't think you were, dude.  The thing about abortion, I'm a liberal.  I ran for Green Party on a local ticket a couple years ago.  I come from a liberal family, a Democrat family, and I've registered Republican very painfully  for this man.  Well, let me ask you a question.  This guy's libertarian, and he thinks that homosexual behavior in the military is disruptive 
[02:58:00]  and should be dealt with?  Well, what he's...  No, this is what he...  See, you got...  You're...  Things are twisted.  They asked him, do you...  What do you think about gays in the military?  Okay.  And what he said was, any behavior that's disruptive, whether it's gay, whether it's straight, is  a problem.  He's actually...  He voted against the marriage bill there that would make marriage between a man and a woman.  He voted against it.  And he actually has a lot of gay supporters, believe it or not.  Yeah, but...  A 32-year-old Republican from Texas.  Well, he did support...  But he encourages states to ban the practice.  Yeah, he did support it. 
[02:58:30]  Hold on.  He's all about states' rights.  That's a cross.  He said he would ban Roe v. Wade.  He would also be against any federal bill that would ban abortion federally.  The idea is the federal government doesn't have the right, and it was never the intention  to centrally control everything.  So if we had states' rights, certainly where I am, abortion would be legal down south.  It probably wouldn't be.  But you could just go to the next state, like an hour and a half drive, and get an abortion.  Yeah, I understand that.  But I think there are certain things we can have federal laws about.  And I don't think we should live in a country where every state has such drastically different laws. 
[02:59:00]  I don't care what the Constitution said.  There was fucking 13 of them.  I don't give a shit.  They didn't have abortion back then.  They didn't have a lot of things we have now.  I think abortion's a divisive issue.  At this point, they're trying to get Republicans.  That's the problem with Ron Paul.  He's got...  I see the most signs around here.  He's raised...  I mean, I don't know if you guys know this or not, but he raised more money in one day  than any presidential candidate has ever done in history.  I don't even care about abortions.  I'll let Stacey go and get her own. 
[02:59:30]  This last FEC filing for the end of the year here, he raised more money, 19 million, than  any of the Republicans, and he's the only one without a loan.  So he doesn't owe anybody else any money.  He also said, while he didn't...  Maybe he doesn't want a constitutional ban.  He supported the 96th Defense of Marriage Act, and he was saying that states don't have  to recognize same-sex marriages performed by another state.  So basically...  Hold on.  His stance is basically that if one state says you can get married, that's fine, but  then the next state doesn't have to recognize it. 
[03:00:00]  So that's basically...  He's not taking a stance on fucking anything.  He's basically just saying, ah, whatever the states want to do is good with me.  I'm over here now.  I'm just going to sit here in this Oval Office and let the states do whatever they please.  Yeah, well, exactly.  It's silly.  Well, the people make the decisions, guys.  It's not...  It's supposed to be the people elect...  The representatives that make decisions for them.  Could you...  Could you...  I understand.  Could you hold on a second?  I got to ask Jimmy something.  Jimmy, do you think Steve likes Ron Paul?  I think Steve loves him! 
[03:00:30]  I know he doesn't have...  All right, we get it.  All right.  This is important.  What's your name?  Ronnie Paul Jr.?  Exactly.  You're a Ron Paul-a-holic, Steve.  You got to get off the Ron Paul, son.  He's the only Republican that would have a chance of winning in the general.  There's no way...  I'm tired of the Republicans.  I'm tired of them.  I am, too.  John McCain is going to win, by the way.  He doesn't have a shot in hell.  Yes.  He will not win.  McCain is our next president.  Mark my words.  After eight years of war-mongering force, we want another one in there?  Mark this time. 
[03:01:00]  Mark the day, so we can pull this audio after Election Day.  I am saying that John McCain will be our next president.  I don't know about that.  Through the process of elimination.  If he wins the Republican nomination...  He wrote the amnesty bill.  Why would Republicans...  He's going to win the nomination.  Don't be naive.  Yeah.  He's definitely going to win the nomination at this point.  And then he will win because this country will not vote in a black guy or a woman. 
[03:01:30]  I don't know about that.  Then why are they showing up in the primaries, like, three to one?  It doesn't matter.  Because there's only Democrats right now, dude.  Who's voting?  Who's fucking voting in these primaries?  You know one fucking person that's voted in a primary.  Dude, you're arguing against what's happening.  McCain, if you know about politics, right?  Ron Paul, I'm looking right now, has three percent in the Republican primary.  Wow.  Undecided is 11 percent.  He's not getting the nomination.  Well, that's for California.  Where's the number coming from, Jimmy?  Dude, listen to me.  The TV right in front of us.  Okay, all right.  Yes, because there's a corporate media blackout of Ron Paul. 
[03:02:00]  Oh.  He got second in one state.  They didn't even report it.  They mis-reported it.  Okay, so you think he's going to get the nomination.  Okay.  All right, you know.  We're all idiots.  You ran for the Green Party.  McCain's not going to get the nomination.  Ron Paul is.  You're right.  No, I'm not saying he is.  I'm saying it's going to be Hillary or Barack.  That's for the Democrats.  I know he's not going to win, guys.  That's for the Democrats.  What about-  We're talking about the nomination.  Why are we voting?  Why are we worried about voting for who's going to win instead of voting for the person  who best represents our views?  I'm telling you what's-  Ron Paul's only real Republican.  The other one is fake.  Hey, dude, stop soapboxing. 
[03:02:30]  I'm not saying you shouldn't vote with your heart.  I am saying that's the reality of what's happening, and you're denying it, saying McCain's  not going to win.  He's going to win the nomination.  Yeah.  Possibly.  It's actually going to go to, it's going to go to a, what do you call it, the, it's  going to be, it's going to be, the delegates will be split, so it'll be, when they go  to the Republican convention, that's probably where they're going to pick the nominee.  So, who's going to be our next president?  If, no Republican will get elected. 
[03:03:00]  Are you, there's only, 25% of people even registered Republican, and it's only because  of what Bush has done for eight years, and you can't really blame anybody, personally.  Who do you think the next president is?  I do not know.  It'll probably be Hillary or Obama, as much as, I don't want any of them.  What if Obama and Hillary team up?  What does that mean?  Fucking done, finished.  You think, right?  It's a double whammy.  It's too much.  I think Obama has a shot, actually, at beating McCain, because I really do think people are  very annoyed at this, and this is my problem with Ron Paul.  There's so many issues that he annoys me on already. 
[03:03:30]  Like, I don't think it should be up to the state.  Personally, I think if gays want to get married, they should be able to.  Well, yeah, he said, if you listen, the whole gay marriage thing, what he ultimately believes  about marriage, and this is for men, and, you know, regardless of the sex, is that marriage  should not be under the jurisdiction of the state at all.  In other words, if a church wants to marry whoever, or a justice of peace wants to, it's  a private ceremony between them.  I'll agree.  But he's saying that one state should not have to recognize it. 
[03:04:00]  They shouldn't.  They shouldn't.  Okay, good.  So how about this?  If a straight guy marries a straight woman, should New Jersey have to recognize it if they  got married in New York?  Or should state to state be able to decide?  That's such a divisive...  No, it's a real question.  If you get married in New York, and then you move to Jersey, all of a sudden your marriage  isn't recognized if you're heterosexual.  Yeah, how about interracial marriages?  A black man and a white woman, should they be recognized in states that might be recognized?  Why not agree with that?  Oh, sorry.  I thought you were asking.  You've got to look at state constitutions and the constitution itself. 
[03:04:30]  It, in fact, states that all men are created equal.  Our people are created equal.  So that's...  That's very silly, sir.  Because when that was written, there were slaves.  Don't start falling back on that.  There's nothing in the constitution about slavery at all.  Right, that's why the constitution is at times beautiful, and at times just a silly document.  You don't need to make a statement against slavery if it says all people are equal.  Sir, the fact that if you write something and it says all men are created equal, and then  you have slaves, there is something kind of silly about that in principle. 
[03:05:00]  You can't disagree with it.  I agree.  I'm not saying the founding fathers were right.  There was slavery in many, many countries.  The point I'm making to you is if the states cannot recognize gay marriage, why should they  be forced to recognize interracial marriages or be forced to recognize any other form  of heterosexual marriage?  I think that in actual action, if there were states down south that, let's say, didn't want  to recognize these types of things or, you know, sort of regressed back, what would  happen is the marketplace essentially would take care of it. 
[03:05:30]  In other words, no one's going to want to live down there where this is going on.  Okay, so the Constitution saying all men are created equal means nothing the marketplace  will dictate.  So your rights should be contingent upon the marketplace in the state in which you live.  No, what I'm saying is the marketplace will take care of any inequities.  I'm not sure what that means.  That means that if, in other words, let's say, right now, the way we have it, we tell  private businesses what to do.  In other words, bars, you can't have people smoking. 
[03:06:00]  There was the person you had on there from Philly, he had Gino.  He had the steak place that said he's English only.  And they said, no, you can't do that.  That's wrong.  They didn't say you can't do that.  They just kind of protested.  He should be able to put up any sign he wants.  We agree.  We know that.  We agree.  Hey, what do you Ron Paul people want?  What we're doing is building, actually, at this point, after New Hampshire, it was quite  obvious.  What we would like is, first of all, fair elections, because I know you're listening to everything  I say from a bias, but I mean this. 
[03:06:30]  There is election fraud going on.  It's right on video.  They're violating the procedure in New Hampshire, and that bothers me.  No matter who you are, it should bother you.  So why didn't they do that with Barack?  What do you mean, why didn't they do that with Barack?  They did.  They screwed Barack.  He was supposed to win New Hampshire by 16 points.  In the hand-counted districts, he did.  In the computer-counted districts, he didn't.  There's a recount going on up there, and it wasn't even covered.  Sir, I'm not going to disagree with you on that, because I'm not saying the election  system is not flawed.  I'm not going to say you're wrong about that.  Well, that's a huge, basic, fundamental thing if your votes aren't being counted. 
[03:07:00]  But I don't like the fact that when we were talking about this gay marriage thing, you  said the marketplace will dictate.  I'm still not exactly sure what that means.  I really don't.  What it means is, you know...  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  Should the federal government just have allowed, if you're saying state-to-state, blacks not  to be admitted into certain colleges in the South when they had to send the National  Guard in to protect them?  Should they not have done that?  Should they allow the state to treat one group of people like shit and another group differently?  No, because that would violate... 
[03:07:30]  That violates law.  I'm not saying they didn't violate these things.  But wait, had they violate law, if they were saying that they just didn't want certain  people going to certain schools, the state thing, how is that a violation of law?  Well, actually, well, government-run schools obviously have to let everybody in.  A private school, they do it right now.  There's private schools that are black only and Hispanic only.  But they will admit someone else, though.  What would happen?  They actually just did.  A guy got into a girls' college.  I think if you go to court and you fight...  There's no school in this country that's black that won't admit white people. 
[03:08:00]  All right.  Steve, wrap up, please.  Well, you know, particularly concerning the FCC, he's made a lot of quotes about that  that I was hoping you guys would pick up on about, you know, basically, again, the private  marketplace regulating content, not government.  So, in other words, if you guys are putting offensive content on your programming, if it's  pay, it really shouldn't matter at all.  Agreed.  If you were, if you were on terrestrial, advertisers would leave, and if there's enough of a real,  not a fake protest, but a real protest, you know, then, again, the marketplace will take 
[03:08:30]  care of itself.  I know these concepts are like...  Well, I agree with you on that, dude.  We completely agree with you, and that's what is going on right now.  You know, we don't...  We're not...  Hold on, hold on.  We're not scared of the FCC anymore.  It has nothing to do with the FCC.  We're in compliance with the FCC.  It's the advertisers that are going to, you know, get us fired the next time around  again.  You're right about the language and the marketplace dictating with that stuff.  I completely agree with you.  But that...  But now when it comes to gay marriage or people being married... 
[03:09:00]  I don't have a problem with gay marriage.  I'm not saying you do.  I'm just talking about your concept about the states and the marketplace dictating stuff.  Honestly, I...  You know, this stuff's new to me.  I've just come...  I came from your typical liberal, government-helps-you type of family, you know, what can government  do for me type of thing.  And I'm just now realizing the government screws stuff up.  They screwed New Orleans up.  And even his military stance is not just Iraq's stance, but his stance about our policing of  the world, which is unconstitutional. 
[03:09:30]  I don't know if you guys know this or not, but these last FEC reports, he gets three times  the donation from the military of any other candidate.  Right.  What does that mean?  Is he the one that wants to take home?  I don't want to carry back to him and not John McCain.  Is he the one...  People over there want to be fighting for the right reasons and not...  Is he the one that wants to...  Is he the one that wants to pull all the military off the bases?  He would pretty much close most bases around the world that aren't needed.  All right.  It's not a weak on defense thing because he's...  No, I know.  I know.  I'll agree with that.  I don't want our fucking soldiers in South Korea. 
[03:10:00]  I like that.  I don't care if Kim Jong-il walks in and takes that shit on the back.  Doesn't matter to me.  Fuck all of them.  I'll agree with him on that.  You know, it's not...  And like they say, they try to say, well, it's un-American, the military doesn't  support him, the military actually does support him.  If you look at really the motives of why we went into Iraq, you know, he voted to find  bin Laden.  He voted to fund for that.  We ended up using it to build a base in Afghanistan and everything else.  And that's what he's against.  And that's why someone like McCain, I don't believe personally, can win in a general because  so many people, 60, 70 percent, are against this Iraq thing and don't want to go into 
[03:10:30]  Iran either.  Look at the...  It was the MTV MySpace debate the other night and McCain and Rami didn't even show up because  they're not going to tell a bunch of 16-year-old kids, yay, we're for Iraq.  And, hey, we might have to draft you because they've used the word draft.  16-year-olds don't vote, so fuck them.  Yeah.  Right.  I...  Well, yeah, but they're the future.  The Republicans are the future.  There's no future, dude.  We're going to just blow up.  Not if Hillary or Obama are our president.  I'd like to see Obama get involved and win.  Thank you, sir.  The only good thing...  All right, so you keep talking.  The only good thing about Obama would be that, you know, that hopefully Sharpton and Jackson 
[03:11:00]  will be out of a job because they can't complain that black people are held down in this  country anymore.  But I also want a Democrat because I want a bit of a change.  Like, I think we need a balance, and I would like to see a balance, and I would like to  see a Democrat get in and just for a change.  I just want a change.  That's it.  That's what most people want, but I don't think they're going to change anything.  That's why I'm stockpiling.  All right.  All right.  See you guys.  All right, guys.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Ken in Connecticut.  Ken, what's up?  Hey, Ron Paul actually said that he disagreed with the Civil Rights Act of 1962 and that 
[03:11:30]  we should have paid slave owners when we took away their slaves because it was robbing private  citizens of private property.  Anyone so obsessed with state rights, and I mean, I know the states have to have certain  rights, but anyone that would allow other people to have their rights denied because  the state says so, I think he's a fucking idiot.  Because the state says so.  You expect me to believe South Carolina is liberal because the state says so?  It's just, you know, it's like, I don't know. 
[03:12:00]  I love the Constitution, but at times it's like, all right, we get it.  It has to be amended.  Let's go to Daniel in Tennessee.  Daniel.  Hey, what's up, Bo?  Hey, man.  Hey, I was just calling to tell Anthony that Damone skit he did when he said he didn't  even care about abortion and sex could get her own.  That shit was hilarious.  That shit was hilarious.  I like Damone.  Anthony, you're a genius, man.  Oh, thank you, my friend.  I watch much too much television.  That's all.  Hey, I love fast times.  Oh, you guys are great, man.  Appreciate it.  I do an impression of that guy, too.  Isn't this great?  You do? 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm eating that some great iced tea.  That's good.  You do retarded Damone.  That's awesome.  He doesn't even take the sip of the iced tea.  He's such a liar.  He's such a liar.  He's such a liar.  He's such a iced tea.  Let's go to Kevin in Virginia Beach.  Kevin.  Yeah.  You've got a pool.  Ron Paul people, are they suggesting we elect a super president?  I don't know.  Very nice.  Bob in Pennsylvania.  Bob? 
[03:13:00]  Hey there, Bab.  Oh, hey.  Hey.  Yeah, I just wanted to inform Jimmy that his friend Dennis from the Bunny Ranch is also  a huge Ron Paul supporter.  He even set up a donation box for him there.  I love Dennis, but I'm guessing it's because if he's so obsessed with state rights, Ron Paul,  he's probably for legalizing prostitution a lot of places.  What does Dennis know about politics?  Come on.  Dennis is a moneymaker.  Dennis is a real estate guy.  He knows about making money, which I respect, but he probably likes the state freedom that  Ron Paul would give him.  All right.  Learning about Ron Paul.  Rob in Virginia.  What's up? 
[03:13:30]  Hello?  Hi, Rob.  Hey, I don't know a lot about politics, but Ron Paul is for legalization of pot, and that's  reason enough to vote for him right there.  You sound like the kind of guy that could really run with that.  Are you on pot right now?  Or just walk slowly.  Did you smoke this morning?  No, I'm out right now.  I'm getting ready to.  Yeah.  You're getting ready to?  We'll wake and bake.  Dude.  All right.  Yeah. 
[03:14:00]  Fantastic.  They're talking to you, sir.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Rob.  Yeah.  They're talking to you.  Who's talking to me?  It's Rob.  Rob.  Yeah.  They're talking to you.  Who's talking to me?  They're talking to you.  Where?  Right there.  Where?  Rob.  From the other room.  The other room.  Yes.  I'm outside.  Get out of here.  Do we have audio of this? 
[03:14:30]  Joran Van Der Sloot?  Can we get this?  I don't know.  It's a huge story.  This fucking guy is basically admitting that he killed Natalie Hothway.  This piece of shit.  Well, he's admitting that she died in his presence.  Right.  They were on the beach.  Here's what he said.  Having some consensual whatever.  And she started convulsing.  Yeah.  And he said it was like in the movies.  Where she was just like bucking and convulsing.  And he was just saying, oh, you know.  He was trying to give her CPR or something.  A UPS. 
[03:15:00]  And saying, why the fuck does this got to happen to me?  You fucking bitch.  You know, really being a nice guy.  And then when he assumed she was dead, he called a friend instead of the police or 911 or something.  Whatever they got down there.  And said, hey, could you help me get rid of this girl?  The friend came with a boat.  They threw her in the boat.  Took her out into the ocean.  And dumped her body out there where it will just disappear.  I just hate this fucking kid so much. 
[03:15:30]  I think he's a privileged, just a spoiled little rich cunt.  Hope he gets caught and goes to jail.  Let's see.  He's a weak.  Michael, Missouri.  Michael.  What's up?  Hey.  How are you, man?  Thank you.  You guys rock.  Oh, thanks.  All right.  Let's go to Sean of Virginia.  Sean.  Shouldn't you be selling birds in a market?  Blowing yourself up.  What's up there?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, Sean.  Hey, man.  Hey, Ron Paul, going back to him.  He's actually trying to get rid of the IRS because we're trying to pay back the debt 
[03:16:00]  from the Federal Reserve and all that.  And I like that idea.  The more I hear about this guy, though, the more nutty and too many changes.  He's like too many changes at once guy.  So it'll never happen.  He's got to go through Congress to get all these state things passed.  I mean, there's a lot of other things that, I mean, just because he says this doesn't  mean actually all this is going to happen, you know?  Right.  Oh, good.  So we'll just get a guy in there that isn't really going to do this stuff.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm sure he's going to push for it.  And, you know, the people are going to decide in the end. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  How does that work in the end?  You can push for anything.  I love the idea of some kind of tax reform where, you know, you pay maybe a flat tax.  70% like Steve Forbes said.  I like that.  Fair enough.  I don't mind.  That's good.  And everyone pays.  Doesn't matter what the fuck you make.  Don't make.  I kind of like that.  Because now, I just find it ridiculous that you're constantly being taxed.  You get taxed.  The second you make money, it's taxed.  And then every time you go to spend it, it's taxed. 
[03:17:00]  And then once you buy something, you got to continue paying taxes on.  It just doesn't make sense.  They can't keep their fucking hands out of your pocket.  Yeah.  The second they need money, instead of fixing something that's broken to maybe plug the  leaks of money that's in the government, they just tax the fuck out of you more.  Whether it's their tolls, they just cannot keep their fucking hands out of your pocket.  You're a 50-50, at least, a 50-50 partner with the government.  Disgusting. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  Let's go to Jessica.  Jessica.  Yes.  Jessica.  Hi.  Hello, Jessica.  Sorry, I'm really nervous.  I've never been on the end before.  Can you take all your clothes off before you talk to us?  No, because I wanted to actually give you guys some credit, because people call up and  expect you and Jim Norton to be idiots, because they think you guys don't know anything.  And it's very aggravating to listen to you guys every morning, and then have these assholes  call up.  Ooh, I'm not allowed to say that.  I'm sorry.  No, you can say that.  You can say whatever you want. 
[03:18:00]  And most people don't call us idiots.  They don't, but they try to undermine you.  Maybe the media or something, but the listeners...  Not to our face.  Not to your face, but they try to undermine you.  Like, bring up things like you guys don't already know, and then I love when you jam  it down your throat.  Yeah, so do I.  Make choking sense.  All right, Jessica.  Thank you.  I just want to...  I love you guys.  Thank you, Scott.  I'll see you at the camp.  See Jim Norton.  Oh, goodbye, Jessica.  Well, hello.  I'm sitting there. 
[03:18:30]  Hello, Jess.  Hey.  You woke up and tell me that.  Oh, Jimmy.  Jimmy, I hate when they...  What do you hate?  I love when you shove it down people's throats.  I hate when they crawl up and they start all...  Oh, God.  And then you go, open wide, sweetheart.  Have a fucking...  Have a gullet full of throat yogurt, you silly goose.  It's Friday, Saturday, Bananas Poughkeepsie.  Have a jizz popsicle.  Yeah.  Oh, I like that.  You make clumpsicles. 
[03:19:00]  It's good for when it's hot in the summer.  Travis pulled Jim freaking out on the phone.  The phone call with Donna.  Oh, it's so funny.  Derico or D'Erico or whatever.  I was calling her Derico on purpose.  D'Erico.  It's Donna D'Erico, right?  Can we hear this?  I was very annoyed.  Here we go.  Hi, Donna.  How are you?  Oh, great.  How are you, Steve?  Hello.  Hi.  I can't really hear.  Can you hear me?  I can hear you.  Oh, I hope so.  Oh, Donna, can you hear me?  I can hear you.  Go ahead. 
[03:19:30]  I cannot hear her at all.  This connection is messed up.  And apparently at the office, we don't have people who are going to help us when we're  calling in.  Oh, that's a shame because...  Hold on.  I'm very apologetic.  I'm trying to turn the volume up on the phone.  I don't know why it's not...  Maybe Don Wicklund can help unless he's waxing his chest.  He wouldn't be doing...  Yeah, that's right.  Okay, why would anybody help?  Because I'm standing here like an idiot on hold.  I guess I'll just stand here and continue to talk.  I can't hear you. 
[03:20:00]  I can hear you.  Yeah, I think the...  There's something wrong with the phone?  There's something wrong with the phone.  But we have so many callers that want to talk about Ron and talk to you.  God damn it.  Maybe if he calls back, that'd be...  Now, Donna, obviously...  You're fucking falling while I'm on hold like that?  How about holding...  Wow.  I could hear that.  Holy fucking shit.  Uh-oh.  Somebody's cursing on the air. 
[03:20:30]  Nice.  Who is?  I don't know.  I just heard that previous caller, perhaps.  Hello.  I was a little upset.  Hello.  And then he comes out all jolly.  Can you hear me, Donna?  I can hear you fine.  Oh, okay.  I couldn't hear you.  I'm sorry.  I was yelling because my office phone...  Because that was how I executed produce.  And there you have it.  Wow.  I missed all that because I went to try to help you.  Yeah, he's just...  He completely breaks character.  Can't anything work on this fucking phone? 
[03:21:00]  And then, yes.  Hello, I'm back.  The fun guy.  Only because everybody walked out.  It was just me and E-Rock sitting there.  I was like, what the fuck?  Yeah.  Everyone's gone.  I'm alone in this room.  Right.  Let's do a quick break and we'll continue.  Stay there.  I can't wait to get my BlackBerry.  BlackBerry.  Verizon.  Do you realize who you hired?  He's a disruptive influence.  Anthony.  He happens to be a dwarf.  What horrible people.  Our new bosses said, you guys should get as crazy as you want.  They keep creating new ways to celebrate mediocrity. 
[03:21:30]  Opie and Anthony show.  It's psychotic.  99 problems.  Yeah.  All hell's breaking loose during the break.  Jimmy's a little upset.  I wouldn't say...  I wouldn't go as far as...  Not upset, but you're pointing out something.  Also, though, Bob Kelly, just a dope.  He's as dumb as...  Bob is a fucking...  He's a bag of rocks.  Yeah.  He just did his promo for his CD.  Yeah.  I'm sorry. 
[03:22:00]  What?  That wasn't on air.  I apologize.  What happened?  Are you listening to mine?  You just yelled out...  You just yelled out...  What?  Someone's refusing to come on air.  Who?  Danny won't come on air?  Oh, boy.  Why?  All right.  Well, first, the Bob Kelly thing.  Tower Records, which is where Bob said he can get his CD in April.  Uh, Bob, you fucking stupid fat body. 
[03:22:30]  They've been out of business for a year.  An idiot is promoting it.  They're good.  Which is actually where you should go if you want to buy his new CD.  Yeah.  Tower Records.  And if they don't have it, try Corvettes or Two Guys.  You fucking mocha.  Two guys.  The Corvettes or Two Guys.  Oh, what a yutz.  We have the clip isolated, if you'd like to hear it.  Oh, he's...  Yeah, can we hear that?  Yeah, here it is.  And in April, my CD comes out, just the tip, through Comedy Central Records. 
[03:23:00]  I want to make it number one.  That's right.  I want to beat Dane Cook on the Billboard charts.  So if every one of you fans goes out in April and buys my CD, that means I'll be on the Billboard charts.  I want to be number three.  I want to be before Prince and you, too, if those albums come out.  I want you to go and buy it.  Just the tip.  In April, make sure you go down.  Tower Records.  Buy it.  You want to beat Dane Cook, you fucking idiot?  You couldn't beat Jim Cook in CD sales. 
[03:23:30]  Go to Tower Records.  Oh, what a total asshole.  We got Danny on the line here.  Uh, Danny.  Hello.  What happened?  Yeah, what happened, man?  Steve said he got a text.  Now where's Steve?  No, I was just having an IM conversation with Steve.  I don't know why he felt that it needed to be broadcast.  Well, I mean, that's kind of what we do to each other around here.  You know, there's really nothing private.  No, that's fine.  So Steve said that you felt like you kind of got thrown under the bus or what?  No, the problem, I mean, being thrown under the bus is just fine if it's legitimate.  I just, you know, it just sucks that, you know, people say one thing when it just wasn't the case. 
[03:24:00]  What are they thinking?  Well, I mean, it's being implied that I just, you know, lied to take the day off and, you  know, I legitimately didn't feel good this morning.  I don't think anybody doubted.  Nobody thought that you weren't, you were feeling up to snuff.  I don't think anybody was saying you were lying.  I don't know.  I think the implication was maybe that if you had a few too many, it happens.  I mean, you know, it's...  Yeah, but that's not, dude, that's really, it just, that totally just wasn't it, man. 
[03:24:30]  If it was, I would just fess out, but it wasn't.  Well, okay, then the audio just sounded a little, a little questionable.  Yeah.  That's fine.  Dan, it's like I was telling you before.  No one's...  Oh, you know him better than we do.  You call him Dan.  He's, he was writing for me.  Dan.  That's like when Jay Leno goes to Robert De Niro.  Bob.  All right, Dan.  Okay.  I want to call him Dan, too.  You go ahead and you call him Dan.  Dan, Steve.  All right.  It's like I was telling you before.  I don't think anybody questions the fact that you're not feeling well. 
[03:25:00]  I think the, I think the ball breaking was you calling in, sounding a little tipsy to  the Ron and Fez show last night.  So, but...  That's fine, but...  A little tipsy.  He sounded like Ted Kennedy when he fucking pulled the car into the car.  All right.  That's me trying to be nice.  So did Anthony.  Exactly.  Anthony sounded loaded.  I was, uh, I was doing all right last night.  Having some fun.  And why not?  Super Bowl Sunday, for fuck's sake. 
[03:25:30]  Like, I'm just, you know, it's, obviously it, it looks terrible because it's the day  after the Super Bowl, but I mean, that's, that's why I knew this was coming.  Because I'm like, fuck, when I was, you know, this morning, when I'm shitting my brains out,  I'm like, this sucks because I'm going to, I'm going to call out and everybody's just  going to think that, you know, it's for a different reason because it's the day after  the Super Bowl.  And I knew there was nothing I was going to be able to do about it, but I mean, that's how  shitty I felt this morning.  I was like, there's no fucking way I could possibly go in right now.  Yeah.  Bill Kaye from Philly's Right.  Hey, uh, Opie, you get the fucking shits when you drink too much. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah.  It fucking happens.  And we were kind of, but nobody was implying it in a horrible, like, you know, fucking  terrible way.  It was just like a little ball breaking, but it wasn't even that bad.  Yeah.  I mean, dude, I don't mind.  And believe me, I don't mind ball breaking, but you know, it's just, it just always, I  don't know.  You seem like you get pissed.  You seem like you get a little pissed. 
[03:26:30]  Nobody likes when they're on the other end of it.  That's...  No, it's not that, dude.  I can totally deal with ball breaking, ball busting is just fine.  It's just when my...  I don't know how to describe it.  It's...  Liver?  Jesus.  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, no.  See?  I just, I can't, I just, I can't describe it the right way.  What do you mean not say it, though?  I'm not, I'm just teasing you, man.  I just want to know what you're, I want to know what you're going to say.  Like, like, for instance, like, you know, like, shit is more, like, that's real, you 
[03:27:00]  know what I'm saying?  Like, lying to get out of, you know, to get out of, like, that's a real thing.  So I don't want people to think that because it's not true.  So, you know, busting balls is just fine.  But when it comes to something, like, real, like, that's just kind of, that irked me.  So it got me a little, it got me a little pissed.  Steve, so...  Okay, but you weren't lying to get out of work, correct?  No, but that's what's being implied.  So that's why I was, you know, I don't mind the ball busting, but I just, you know, I  didn't want anybody to think that that was actually the case, because it wasn't. 
[03:27:30]  But nobody said that.  And that's what I was telling you before.  We were thinking about that.  Steve, it was just being implied, so it, you know...  Of course it was being implied, Steve.  Yeah, of course.  Steve, Jesus.  I mean, Steve, did Danny have photos of you blowing somebody?  I'm Larry Literal.  Danny was even aware when we talked to him earlier, and we're like, no one's saying that.  But yeah, we all were saying it, of course.  That was the bit.  I'm trying to be diplomatic.  We played the fucking slurry fucking audio from Ron and Fez.  And I understand that it's ball busting, and that's fine.  I'm fine with the ball busting aspect of it. 
[03:28:00]  But, you know, as far as people thinking that that's the legitimate, you know, reason,  that's what I have a problem with, because it just really, really wasn't.  I'm not dumb enough to fucking take the day off after the Super Bowl because I had,  you know, too many beers.  Like, that's retarded.  But maybe that's why you would do it.  Ah.  That's right.  And nobody plans on that.  I mean, I've had a few mornings.  So basically, Danny doesn't want to.  Look, listen, I'm writing an email at 410 in the morning going, fuck, this just sucks,  because I know how this looks. 
[03:28:30]  And I know I'm going to take shit for it, but there was no way.  I mean, I would have shit and puked my way to the studio.  Matt LaFarre writes from Queensbury.  He writes, look, if Danny wants the day off and needs to pretend he's sick,  the listeners are okay with that.  Okay.  Fair enough.  I don't want to.  And it is being reminded, we're being reminded that you did come into Free FM and slept on  the couch and was still hammered during the boiling barbecue.  That was my one legitimate fuck up.  So you don't want people to think that you're a raging alcoholic. 
[03:29:00]  That was one time.  That was really bad.  And I have no excuse for that.  Right.  But, you know, but I mean, they remember that.  Then they're thinking today.  And you just don't want people to think that about you.  Plus the phone call last night where you could barely get the words out.  I know my case isn't looking very good, but that's just why I'm so infuriated about the  whole situation.  Because I really legitimately, like I was having a serious problem this morning.  And I don't want anybody to think that it was for any other reason besides, you know,  seriously being very sick. 
[03:29:30]  You should still be shitting at, you know, like water and stuff.  So why don't you just get it on some, you know, get a phone video or something.  We believe that you're sick.  No one thinks that you're not feeling terrible.  I think he's feeling ill.  I had a really good one about nine, about nine-ish, 930.  I really wish that you had the cold vent so you could hear it.  I think that we do believe that you're sick.  But I do think that it's not that we doubt that.  Of course, we don't think you're lying.  And we think that just the source of the illness may be misdiagnosed. 
[03:30:00]  No, believe me.  I think I've had enough experience to know the difference.  And this was definitely, it wasn't just, you know, beer shits or whatever you want to call it.  It was, I mean, there was a lot of nausea accompanied by it.  And it just, it wasn't a good thing.  No, I've seen him, you know, put some down and show up for work the next day without a problem.  That was not just fucking just a few beers and then you shit your brain.  This was not it.  That was not that.  I've seen that happen, you know, where you had a few beers and you come in to work and you're fine. 
[03:30:30]  So it's not like, you know, you couldn't have done it this time.  And again, you know, the ball busting is fine.  I don't mind ball busting.  I mean, if I was going to have a problem with ball busting, I think I'm working for the wrong show.  But I just didn't want anybody to think that that was actually the re-like call.  He's just calling out because he had too much to drink.  It's just not the case, man.  And, you know, I just wanted to make that known.  All right.  All right.  Fair enough.  If I was going back and forth with Steven and I am, that's, you know, that's fine. 
[03:31:00]  Well, now you're mad at Steve because he brought it to our attention that you were having a private conversation.  No, I'm not mad at Steve.  He had to.  He's got to bring one thing to the show a day.  Yeah.  Look at this text I just received.  He actually ran in with his computer and held it up for everyone to see.  Exactly.  It's unplugged.  You retard.  When you're as useless as I am, you have to be productive.  And that's how you executively produce.  That's right.  Executively.  And, Danny, you have every right to be mad at Steve because if I had a private conversation  with Steve and he brought it up on the show, I'd be very pissed off myself.  Well, you know, I understand that. 
[03:31:30]  It's fair game.  So, now Steve can't be trusted with private conversations, honestly.  Not even remotely.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Uh-oh.  All right, well, things are getting ugly.  Let's say hi to Peter in Massachusetts.  Peter.  Yeah, this guy's full of shit.  I'm a fucking Patriots fan.  And I woke up vomiting, dry heaving, because I drank too much. 
[03:32:00]  And I still want to fucking work.  You got a little diarrhea?  Fucking man up, douchebag.  Man up, douchebag?  It wasn't just shit, too.  I mean, it was very terrible nausea.  Let's go to Todd in Salt Lake.  Todd.  Todd, hey, this guy is full of shit, man.  Yeah, he's full of shit.  Hey, yeah, I'm full of shit.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  I think Danny's just made of this private conversation. 
[03:32:30]  I would hate to text something and have it read out.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, wait, the bus is turning.  That's not good.  George in Cleveland.  Good afternoon.  Yes, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  I just wanted to say, if Danny wanted to get out of the whole thing, he should have just  worn an eye patch.  It would have been good.  Oh.  Danny.  No, no, no, no.  All right.  All right, Danny.  We'll see you tomorrow, right?  Maybe, unless I drank too much.  All right.  Well, fair enough.  And Steve, yeah, tattletale. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah, I know.  That's wonderful.  I know.  Steve has to bring stuff to the air.  Yeah.  I mean, it's fair enough.  I mean, we all bring our awful lives up.  Except for Steve.  Yeah.  Well, Steve's life's a, I would say it's an open book, but, well, it's an open book in  a closet.  Yeah.  Open pair of ass cheeks.  Yeah.  Book's open, but it's in the closet.  Steve gets his balls broken.  Can't read it in there.  Yeah.  All right, Steve.  Thanks for being a...  Tattletale.  With tattletale.  Useless tattletale.  All right, Danny.  Thanks.  Useless queer tattletale.  More adjectives.  Keep them coming.  We were talking politics, and we'd get this out of the way. 
[03:33:30]  Jimmy loves Ann Coulter, right?  I don't always agree with her, but I like the fact that she says what she wants to say.  Yeah.  I'm standing on substance here.  Yes.  It's immigration.  It's limits on free speech.  It's not supporting tax cuts.  It's ANWR.  It's torture at Guantanamo.  It's class warfare rhetoric.  Right.  It's interrogations.  It's Guantanamo.  It's ANWR.  It's...  This is not...  These are not small issues to conservatives.  No, and if you're looking at substance rather than whether it's an R.D. after his name, 
[03:34:00]  manifestly, if he's our candidate, then Hillary's going to be our girl, Sean, because she's  more conservative than he is.  I think she would be stronger on the war on terrorism.  You really believe that?  I absolutely believe that.  This idea that...  That's the one area I disagree with.  No.  Can I just say one thing?  No.  No.  She will...  Yeah, we're going to sign up together, but let me explain that point on terrorism.  We're going to be together...  So you would vote for Hillary over...  Yes.  I will campaign for her if it's McCain.  That's pretty impressive, huh?  Wow.  Yeah. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah.  It's a little...  She's pretty...  She's hardcore.  I wonder if that's got anything to do with the woman thing.  Yeah.  And Colton's not above that, man.  Wanting to see a woman get in.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't think...  She's a human being.  I mean...  All right.  Way to explain it.  She's a human being.  And I fucking dig my nose at my wrinkled tissue.  You're feeling a little snotty.  I'm a zilch.

[03:37:30]  His stupid, his neck warmer  that he carries around that's attached to him.  Like  during commercials when he wanted to talk to him.  Jimmy just goes, send that  incompetent in here.  And everyone knew who to get.  Of course they did.  Then he walked in completely clueless.  Had no idea we were talking about him.  He has a neck.  He looks like fucking, uh...  He kind of looks like the old Mr. Freeze.  Oh, shit.  From the original?  Yeah.  From the fucking...  From the Batman and  giant cock A pair of underwear series. 
[03:38:00]  Fucking  Burt Ward and that fucking  delicious gift  he called a fucking baby maker.  Alright, I'm just babbling.  Where's E-Rod?  I thought he was coming for a beating.  Why were you late today?  How late was he?  Pretty late.  Got in, uh...  Just about 5.30.  Ah.  Why?  Why this time?  It was late last night.  Cleaning up and...  Oh, it's good to know  you can make your own hours. 
[03:38:30]  Cleaning up what?  Cleaning up.  We were all cleaning up.  Fucking  I had a Super Bowl party.  I would have loved to  come in at 5.30 today.  What were you cleaning up?  Our place.  We had a lot of people over.  What, have you been  shit on the fucking couch?  So you decided...  You decided you're so great  for the show  I'll just show up at 5.30.  What time is he supposed  to be here?  5.  The latest never happens  by the way.  Is he late a lot?  Are you late a lot?  That's not true.  I'm here around 5  a lot of the time.  Fucking fan 
[03:39:00]  just threw his pen.  Oh, good fan.  He's not gonna accept  that shit.  Oh, shit.  Good.  When you're going  at 11.30  you can wonder  why I'm still here  until 1 or 2.  Ooh.  You fucking waste  your time, Eric.  I'm so fucking sick  of this  I Am Such a Good Worker  facade.  Really?  Nobody fucking buys it,  alright?  Everyone knows  you're on fucking...  You're listening to  Ron and Fez.  You're on fucking  Pal Talk.  You're IMing shit.  Really?  Go through that book  and tell me what's in there.  Where are all the archives?  Nobody so fuck knows!  That's the best part.  Even you!  Because you don't sit around 
[03:39:30]  and look at anything!  You don't even know  what's in that book.  Hey, Eric,  where's that fucking thing  from the archive?  Oh, okay.  I'm in charge  of the XM studio,  but hey, Eric,  where's this piece on it?  Where's that disco pad  in front of it?  Maybe if you looked in there.  Yeah!  Why should...  That doesn't make  any fucking sense!  You want to run  this shit over here?  Look at it!  I don't need to catalog  what you've already  fucking awfully cataloged again.  You don't even know  it's there, though,  so don't give me shit  that I'm here  way after all you guys  putting all this shit together  and you don't even  look at it.  Okay, well, 
[03:40:00]  let's say the XM  is my responsibility.  Then you fuck the CBS show  all the time  with the amount of time  it takes you.  If this is such fucking  masterfully,  geniusly organized,  why is it...  Where...  How come Sam  has had to burn  the fucking  bottle bling spot  three different times?  I don't know,  maybe it got thrown out  after the second time  we used it  because nobody thought  it was going to be used again.  But everything else  that's really important  is there.  It was a fucking bit!  Like, why...  Why throw it out  while it's still topical?  Wasn't topical 
[03:40:30]  up until now.  Okay, what about  the second time then?  It was there.  You didn't have to burn it  the second time.  We had it.  Why do you have to  burn it again?  We didn't have it  after the second time.  There's a lot of shit  that gets thrown out  and doesn't need to say it.  Why can't you be here?  And why...  Okay, fine.  You get...  I leave here earlier than you.  I also get here  every day earlier than you.  Yes, you do.  And you also live  a block from here.  That's not a fucking excuse.  You know what I do?  I pay rent  and they give me  that apartment.  That's the deal  I have worked out.  Okay.  So it's only fair.  I pay probably more rent  because I live in Manhattan 
[03:41:00]  and I live close  to the fucking studio.  Okay.  So what's your point?  I don't do your job  and you don't do my job.  What?  I don't do your job  you don't do my job.  And you don't do your job.  Right.  So it's perfect.  Okay.  Let's say you do  half the shit that I do  on a daily basis.  I will gladly do it.  My job doesn't end  after I leave here.  I'm still doing shit  at home too.  Do you know  half the shit that I do?  No, you don't.  Yeah, well...  No, you come in  and you see me  Oh, he's in the studio.  I'm sitting here 
[03:41:30]  looking up news stories  and everything  so Eric's not contributing.  Shouldn't I know what you do?  Shouldn't it be material  for the show?  Shouldn't it not be a mystery?  What do you think  all this shit is?  It's all for the show.  Fucking sick of you.  And all this  fucking perception  that I don't do shit  around here.  I don't think  you use your time well.  Good!  I don't give a shit  about your time either.  You leave at 11.30, 12.  Yes, because I use my time well.  No, you're done  as soon as the show is done.  I'm not.  I...  So because I don't have  to come in early  like you do 
[03:42:00]  to do half the shit  that you do  because it's not my job.  Yeah.  Okay?  So because I'm not  doing your job  means, oh, I'm not doing  the shit that I'm supposed  to be responsible for.  I'm sure you're doing it  but your job is to get here  at five.  End of story.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  I don't care what you have to do.  If it's unfair  because I have to do less work  then fucking take it up  with somebody.  But that doesn't mean  because you have to do more work  that you get to show up late.  I'm sorry.  No, it doesn't mean.  That's not true.  Today was not an excuse.  It was a late night.  I got up late.  But it happens all the time.  There's been several times  over the past three weeks 
[03:42:30]  where they've been like,  hey, can we cut that up  from yesterday's show?  And I go in  and fucking Pat Duffy  is sitting where you are.  The interns are beating you  to work.  Okay.  That is the issue at hand.  What is your defense  to saying you are  not punctual in the least?  What doesn't get done?  What doesn't get done  that is needed there?  It's  It doesn't  What?  No.  What doesn't get done  that's needed there?  Fucking show audio  does not get pulled.  Somebody else has to do it. 
[03:43:00]  Derek has to do it.  Show audio that has to get pulled.  Like daily news shit?  No, like the fucking  stuff from yesterday's show  that we want on today's show.  There's been several times  when Ope's like,  hey, we should replay that  because it was funny  and you haven't been around.  And then I have to wait  until you're around  for you to do your job.  Okay.  First, I'm hearing of that  but all right.  Everything is always there 
[03:43:30]  when he needs it.  When there's shit brought up  they're like,  well, where is this?  Maybe because you guys  didn't tell me about it.  That's fine.  But as long as it  if you're here at five  we don't have to  it's not a race.  It's not a crunch.  It can actually get done  in properly.  And we don't have  it's not like a fucking race  to get everything  smashed in  in the last minute.  Well,  I don't know what to tell you.  It all gets done.  It's all here.  Hi, Steve. 
[03:44:00]  Hi, fan.  I was just called in here.  By who?  Well, because you're kind of like  charter everybody  like you're the executive producer.  He never has an idea  of what's happening.  No, I know.  He always walks in  like a five-year-old  watching his parents  like a big domestic blowout.  Like, what do I do?  No, this is exactly it.  That's the preemptive  am I getting yelled at  or am I supposed to yell  at somebody clip?  This has been brewing  for a while.  Fan does not like the fact  that Eric comes in late. 
[03:44:30]  Eric does stay a lot later  and thinks that he's  he should be  he should be given  a little bit of a  a little bit of leeway  in terms of his  30 minutes every day.  Leeway.  He comes in like late a lot?  No, I'm saying he comes in  his his start time is five.  Eric's start time is five.  So today he showed up  he showed up 30 minutes  beyond when he should have been here.  And he shouldn't have done that.  The leeway is built in.  But going past  coming in past five  is no leeway.  So so Fan is mad at him 
[03:45:00]  because he showed up late today?  And for the past  couple weeks it's been  and to be perfectly blunt  as soon as he's not being monitored  is what the problem is.  So as soon as  I don't know  I haven't been keeping track  of of Eric's  neither have I.  So I don't really know.  I don't have  I don't have logged  you know times.  In fact Opus said  that we were not  we weren't supposed to monitor  a lot of Eric's behavior.  So because Eric is staying late a lot  and you know  he does do a lot of work  after the show.  How much of that time 
[03:45:30]  is spent  you know as you  as you put it  dicking around  you know  or however you phrase it.  What's your response to that  Iraq?  Because you said  No it's bullshit  because when the show is done  everyone hangs around  goofs around for a while  and if they've got stuff to do  they'll do it a little later  they don't do it immediately  right after the show.  So if I'm on the computer  looking at stuff  Danny's on the computer  I'm not throwing Danny  under the bus  I'm just stating that  like he looks at some stuff  his email or YouTube  or whatever  everyone does this shit.  Okay.  Fan orders his lunch  sits around 
[03:46:00]  eats his lunch  and then  I don't know what he does  after that.  I'm not saying that  he's doing anything wrong.  I just  I don't know what he does  after that  but he's usually gone.  I'm usually the last one  to leave  unless I've got some other stuff  that I really have to get done  I'm always the last  to leave here.  And it doesn't mean  oh Eric's taking forever  or just goofing off  or anything.  There's a lot of shit  that I do  that is very time consuming  and it takes a while  to do this  to make sure it's cataloged  to make sure it's labeled right  make sure we have it  available to somebody else.  For instance  what last week 
[03:46:30]  what were you working on  that you had to stay late for?  Let's see  I had some Worst of stuff  I had stuff  What does it mean  some Worst of stuff?  When Butcher cuts up  Worst of  I go through  the stuff that he cuts up  I make sure it's labeled right  because a lot of the stuff  isn't labeled correctly  so that we have it.  He gave me some older  Opie and Anthony stuff  that I've been going through.  Yes  also been doing that  during the show.  I understand  going through their old shows  is very time consuming.  And tedious then  just saying.  Well  time consuming 
[03:47:00]  Alright cool  we got to 11  thanks guys.  Before we go  before we go  I have 23 more seconds  of anger  if you want to  Just quick  because Travis  is kind of  just like  the middle child  back there  Hey Jen Brady  do you have anything  to contribute to this?  Do you have any  like you know  you see what goes on?  Well  no I don't think  Eric's excuse  of fan living closer 
[03:47:30]  so he can get in earlier  really flies  because I wake up  at 2.45  to get here at 4.30  so  Okay  and I come in earlier  when I know  that I have more work  to do in the morning  Okay  but  Oh  Oh  Oh boy  Eric  I live further from you  and I come in at 4.30  you should be able  to get in  at 5 o'clock  every day  If I  like  if I miss the subway  if I'm running  5 minutes late  and I miss the subway  I drive in  because I can't afford  to be late 
[03:48:00]  so I get here  even earlier  I'm saying  if all of us  when we first started  at CBS  it was producers  get in at 4.30  and gradually  your time  has gotten to 5 o'clock  and  you still can't  get there at 5 o'clock  If all of us  can get here at 4.30  you should be able  to get here at 5  if we've made that  concession for you  Just because Danny  isn't here  doesn't mean  he can't fling  a few barbs  This is from Danny  That is well enough  to be on Pal Talk  Exactly 
[03:48:30]  No this is through  a messenger  Like when he goes  on Pal Talk  and listens to  Ron and Fez  till 3  Uh oh  That is one accusation  saying that you're on Pal Talk  I don't go on their show  and call their show  all the time  Listening  I'm not a regular  Sorry  What are you saying  because he was on  the fucking thing  last night  He was on the phone  No  He's on there  He's on there  all the time  Is he?  He goes in  every now and then  Ron will see him  walk by  and he goes in  I don't think  deflecting what was said  though  it says that you  you're on there  you know  till 3 o'clock 
[03:49:00]  listening to  Ron and Fez  and then  is this it  he  he pays  Pat Duffy  out of his own pocket  to do work for him  That's not true  That's never happened  No  I don't pay him  to do work for me  No  I don't  No  because the kid  works hard  he's got  no  he doesn't have  a pot to piss in  and every now and then  when he's telling me  something that he's  going through a hard time  I think once or twice  I've kicked him  a couple  a couple of bucks  out of my own pocket  How much? 
[03:49:30]  I don't know  maybe 10  20 here or there  To do what?  To do nothing  Oh so Pat Duffy  does nothing?  It's good outsourcing  Who's on the phone?  Is this Danny?  Yeah Eric  Are you there?  Hold on  He's got to get  his headphones on  He didn't realize  he was on the air  the last half hour  Jesus  Yeah  Eric  When am I on  Ron and Fez  all the time?  I don't know  I've heard you  every now and then  Ron goes  oh there's Danny  blah blah blah  and then I'm not  paying attention 
[03:50:00]  to the show  Hang on  so because Ron  mentions my name  that equates to me  being on the air  all the time?  I don't know  you're in some time  I'm never on  Ron and Fez  Eric  I'm never on  Ron and Fez  and look  and not for nothing  but you know what  you do sit around  in the office  and it just kind of  seems like you're  sitting there on cam  doing nothing  for most of the time  I'm not saying  that you don't work  Eric  I'm just saying  that maybe  you're here  maybe you're the  last one at the office  because you're just  fucking hanging around  not doing much of anything  I'd like to address  a common misconception  that's coming in  off feedback  Shay from Connecticut 
[03:50:30]  so the underlings  are mad the boss  comes in later  than they do  tough shit  and then the rest  of your feedback  is irrelevant  because your first fact  is incorrect  they're not upset  that the boss  comes in later  he's not the boss  that's what I'm saying  I'll misinterpret it  I'm not fucking  I'm not trying to shit on you  but you fucking  you know  you brought my name  into it  so now I'm here  I wasn't shitting on you  either  I used you as an example  of how  no I'm not yelling 
[03:51:00]  at you dude  I just brought you up  as an example  of what people do  in the office  after the show  it was not shitting on you  and I stated that  well how about  why don't you bring up  the fucking  you know  the actual work  that gets done  if I'm waiting  for a fucking  for some shit  to mix down  or whatever  yeah I'm gonna  check my fucking email  Danny  I wasn't throwing you  under the bus  hang on  you were sitting  on the bleachers  with fucking  happy typhoon girl  for three hours  and then the next day  going oh  it was super late  yesterday  you know  that kind of fucking  it's dumb  it's stupid  that sounds like  a throw  that's an exaggeration too  no it's not  yeah it is 
[03:51:30]  no it isn't  three hours  sitting on the bleachers  watching Ron and Fez  doing nothing while I'm here  alright there's two  I've there's  there's been time  I'm not saying  that you do that every day  Eric but there have been  time  alright this is another thing  that keeps getting  come up to  if I do anything  then these arguments start  and you're always  the first one to be  oh well you know  I'm here later  than any of you guys  well yeah you are  but you know  it's because of that  it's because you're  just hanging out  and I'm not saying  that's bad  I'm not saying  that you're not allowed  to hang out  that's fine  but don't  you know  don't pretend like  you're fucking  you know  it's crunch time for you  until 3 p.m 
[03:52:00]  no you think  because I'm later  I stay here later  than everybody else  if you see me  talking to somebody  or if I'm doing  something other than  sitting at that desk  in that office  oh Eric does no work  but nobody bothers  to see what the fuck  that I actually do  around here  there's a video  of you sleeping  yeah  that's not part  of your responsibilities  there's not footage  of other people  here sleeping  we're not talking  about other people  Eric  I'm not directing  that at you  it's not an Anthony  wow  why did he turn  that comment around 
[03:52:30]  real quick  I'm not talking  I'm Mr. Marshall  I wasn't talking  about you Mr. Marshall  exactly  who else has been  sleeping  oh you mean Poe  okay  and there's been  other people  who  who  intern who  there's been interns  or other show people  alright  so  what other show people  not on this show  so we're now on  what show  on this show  someone on Bubba the Lug Sponge  and Punt  was he sleeping  boy we all ran 
[03:53:00]  out of steam  quick  what's going on here  come on  you rock  respond  you got some  well I already  have  I don't know  what else  you want me to say  here  do you want  somebody  just to stand  oh  and just see  every little  piece of work  that I do  on a daily basis  that's bullshit  because nobody  else gets treated  like that  Bill K  from Philly  hey Ope  wait a second  Danny didn't  did not even  come in today  because he was  drunk last night  he should not  be talking  Danny should be  very quiet  right now  if that was 
[03:53:30]  the truth  it would hurt  I  see  we got off  the main issue  here  which is  the main issue  on the phone  oh Jesus Christ  the main issue  is the fact  that Eric  is  habitually late  regardless if you  stay later  like I know  that I've had  certain jobs  in the past  where I had to be  somewhere at a  certain time  and if I was late  it didn't matter  if I stayed later  the start time 
[03:54:00]  is a certain time  and you know  for some reason  you have an  inability to  to show up  on time  for your job  and everyone's supposed to be there  at 4.30  but somewhere along the line  E-Rock's time  was moved to 5  and he can't even do that  and now it's 5.30  it's gonna be  you're gonna be working  for the afternoon  drive team  I just  I just don't know  how  you know  I think  I think  it's the boss  E-Rock should maybe  just fire somebody  and bring in  like someone  that will  be more compliant  to his needs 
[03:54:30]  I'm gonna put a chart  up on my  MySpace page  that has some  arrows and names  well there's a lot  of confusion  yes  you know  E-Rock's got the  big gig  and he's in charge  of a lot of  people around here  but uh  who are you in  charge of E-Rock  um  I think Sam  and Travis  and that's about it  that's the only ones  I'm above  you're the same  Eric  well he's pointing at it  absolutely not in charge  of me  we're both producers  yes  we're both in charge  of Sam  oh then that's his fault  and Sam's the boss of us 
[03:55:00]  and Sam is such a smartass  that you can't even get  one over on him  wait  the only one you're in charge  of is Sam  you're half in charge  of Sam  we're all in charge  of Sam pretty much  Sam's your whipping boy  poor Sam  Sam's just waving  yeah everyone else  is on equal footing  I guess huh  no  no  no  no  Sam's promotion  okay it's you  and then  you're gonna get  a sweet promotion  and Travis  so you're a producer  Danny's a producer  Travis a producer  and Sam is uh  no Danny and I  have the same title  which is  senior 
[03:55:30]  oh senior producer  okay senior producer  drunk  no  Danny makes a good one  so wait  I don't want to  stir the pot  but uh  stir it up  let's  uh  in the early days  of this whole XM thing  like  E-Rock got passed up  for the big promotion  because of  some of the dumb things  he does uh  off air  and there's been  tension ever since  really  like what  E-Rock  like he was supposed  to be the guy  like  he was supposed to be 
[03:56:00]  I think  Dan or  Danny right  oh boy  not  I'm not saying  these guys aren't  great at what they do now  but that's in  back in the day  when all this  like hierarchy  chart was being formed  it was gonna actually  be like Steve  and possibly  E-Rock  right below  E-Rock  and it hurts a little  doesn't E-Rock  I don't give a shit  well  the thing with Eric  is this  he's  he's uh  he's extremely  valuable to the show  um  we 
[03:56:30]  we tolerate  sometimes  we all have  imperfections  Eric happens to be  have some of them  but he's very  very valuable  to the show  because what he  brings on the air  um  which is  a lot of fat jokes  just the mistakes  and he's just  he's like Steve  he's like a fucking  30 dimensional guy  you can't not  be interested in him  thank you Jim  you know  I mean we all  understand  where Eric wants  to put his penis  at night  with you  we're not 100% sure  but I'm saying  that that's  E-Rock to me 
[03:57:00]  is very valuable  Eric why is it  that you just  can't  make it in  every day  at the same time  like I don't  because you gotta  catch up on  you know  raw from the  night before  ooh  he really hit you  right there  there's really  no reason  you can't just  say because  I'm tired  or uh  Eric I would  love to show up  in quarters  that would rule  it does believe me  it'd be great  oh I  it just has  Jimmy  do you mean  you're early  Jimmy  if I walk in 
[03:57:30]  and I don't hear  ecstasy  I'm like  you're gonna be happy  when Jimmy shows up  at quarter six  we're all like  wow he's early today  I don't like  I don't like to  talk before the show  I kind of like to  hang out  read the paper  I always want  the conversation  like whatever  you guys are doing  you'll do during  the first break  and that's cool  and if I chime in  I chime in  but I never want  to know what's  being said  it's just a thing  with me  I don't like to  and I like to  sleep later  yes  is that it  you like to sleep  a little later  I wish I could put  in those terms  so I could show up  at five to six  that would rule  that would rule 
[03:58:00]  yeah but you gotta  realize I can't  go to bed  I can't go to bed  before one o'clock  I won't sleep  I mean for 17 years  my clock has been  wired one way  you're crazy  that's the only way  I can do it  so why not  five o'clock  I really don't have  a  I was even your  biggest supporter  because I'm like  alright leave  V-Rock alone  stop keeping track  of when he gets here  it was on the prep  sheet every morning  I said enough guys  you made your point  and then I had  a private talk  with Iraq  I'm like you know  you're giving these guys 
[03:58:30]  ammunition  so why don't you  fucking just show up  at five  and he'll shut  these guys up  and then  you showed up  at five  for maybe two days  in a row  and slowly but surely  went right back  to fucking being late  two weeks  two days  couple days  maybe a week  and I'm like  you know what  you're on your own  let these guys  beat the shit out of you  because you do it  to yourself  you give them  way too much ammunition  do you say  your alarm and everything  and then you just  shut it off  well then what happens  no I have  I have two alarms  take me through the morning 
[03:59:00]  okay I have two alarms  I have an electronic alarm  and I have a wind up  annoying alarm  thing that's on a dresser  away from the bed  I'll get up  I'll turn the alarm off  and sometimes  you're just  you're just kind of  sitting there  where it's like  it's really difficult  to just  well yeah  I know  it's called  getting up for work  it sucks  no one likes to do it  but you're up at that point  you're standing  wait but it's difficult 
[03:59:30]  what's more difficult  that or eating a salad  that's not even right  I eat salads  well now  Iraq do you have any  because the guys are all  kind of giving you  the business here  business  you respond to family  do you have a response  you can't just sit  and take it  you gotta respond with  and defend yourself  like you have been  I get defensive  when it comes to  people thinking  they know what I do  or know what I don't do  as far as this job  is concerned  well Danny was saying  basically 
[04:00:00]  Danny if I could paraphrase  that you were basically  parked on your fanny  talking with happy typing girl  who's just a babbler  as we all know  for three hours  how often is she here  you're yelling at me  I don't know  tell me that  Eric  I didn't say that  it happens every day  and in Eric's defense  I'm sure that  you know  I pay more attention  to the times  where he's just  kind of loafing around  then I do the times  where he's actually  you know  getting something done  let's say  so of course  I'm going to pay  more attention  to when he's just  on pal talk  but it just seems  like there's more  of those times 
[04:00:30]  than you know  other times  and you know  I don't know  what you do at home  so I can't  I'm not around for that  but from what I know  sometimes at the office  that's you know  I call him like I see him  and that's what I see  a lot of times  okay  I see him online  going through shit videos  and different type of  tattoos  and all that other stuff  I never complain  about any of that  he's found  no he's found  some very good stuff  going through videos  I mean some of the  most classic  sound clips  have come from  you know  shit videos  and other things 
[04:01:00]  chocolate rain  I don't think he appreciates  like looking at shit videos  I think he's doing it  for some people too  I wouldn't give him  that much credit  shit video  good shit video  can be pretty entertaining  credit can be  but Eric if I am  if I am  you know  fucking around  and not doing much  or anything  it's because  my you know  my work for the day  is pretty much done  like the replay's done  everything's taken care of  and then you know  that's my time  to you know  do whatever the fuck  I feel like doing  until I get out of there  but I don't pretend  the next day  that oh I spent all 
[04:01:30]  I was working my balls off  yesterday until 2 o'clock  you know  I don't say that  whereas I believe  that you do  time management  E-Rock  a little time management  like is there anything  that you think  the other guys  should be doing  because you obviously  do a lot of archiving  and stuff  get up off the deck  kid what are you doing  you're laying there  like you're a beaten man  no it's  the stuff that I do  you're screaming  nobody really  you obviously feel like  you're the backbone  of the show  so you know  let's get some  constructive stuff  like to Travis  I don't know where she went  but he's around somewhere 
[04:02:00]  what do you think  Travis could be doing  to help you out  a little bit  why don't you  fucking speak up  I've already taken  enough of Eric's  responsibilities  I don't need any more  what's that mean  what are you giving me  shit for  I'm not giving you anything  Sam and I had to  take over your  responsibilities  don't bring me  into this  wait hold on  what do you mean  Travis  what do you mean  I'm not sure what you mean  it was also  no they gave them  they do worst of the week  for the weekend  he does one half  of the show  he does the other  half of the show  Sam  they were given that 
[04:02:30]  I had a lot of other  shit to do  and they were also  given that because  it was also brought to  somebody at XM's attention  that they really weren't  properly trained  as far as the let goes  the system that we use  so basically you're saying  that you took his  responsibility  but you're basically  saying that they  kind of weren't  kind of good at what  that  no I'm not  no they were not  doing anything wrong  they were just  we were told that they  needed to be brought up  to speed as far as  the let goes  and that was one of the  things that was given  to them  I'm sorry Eric  I was told something 
[04:03:00]  differently  by the way  booby man from  Brooklyn  right  shouldn't Danny be  shitting or drinking  right now  I'm not  I will never disagree  Eric does a lot of  work for the show  I don't think anyone  is saying differently  he just has terrible  time management  which bothers everybody  because we're all tired  we all want to sleep in  every day  god damn do I want to  sleep in  every fucking day  yeah  and no one gives a shit  about all the stuff 
[04:03:30]  you are doing for the show  because they get frustrated  that you're not there in time  you know  does it make it harder  than like  like is there stuff  that the show might  and I don't know this  because I'm obviously  not here  I'm here after all you guys  so is there anything  that the show might need  that would be easier  if our own young Eric  was here on time  to organize  because you said before  about a race  well yes  for instance  today  Ope wanted clips  of him  making his  Patriots predictions 
[04:04:00]  because I knew  we were going to  talk about the sports curse  yes  you know  Opie might tell me  this at 5  515  and then  I go in  and ask Eric  can you have this  cut up  and being his boss  and all  well  I mean  okay  the chart doesn't lie  alright  here's what you don't know  I had already  talked with Steve  who had informed me  that these needed to be done 
[04:04:30]  and I said  they will be taken care of  and they were done  when you came in  yeah you talked to him  on the phone  at 530  because you weren't  in the office  oh that is true  oops  oops  wasn't your responsibility  yes it is  because what fucking  Opie will be like  didn't I tell you  to get that ready  it was cut  and ready  to go  everything was set  okay  I apologize  for not celebrating  your cramming abilities  Eric  that's my bad  but  if 
[04:05:00]  what if there was  another thing  you got this thing  done at the right time  but there's sometimes  more than one thing  because there's  lots of things  on the show  and to say  you made it  by a nose  is not impressive  it's not  it's not  helping you  and  I have nothing  against you personally  you are a nice gentleman  it's the stuff  that affects  us and the rest  of the show  that is my only  problem with you 
[04:05:30]  are you crying  and punt  no  so the guys  behind the scenes  I thought you guys  were like a well-oiled  machine  you all got along  like who doesn't  like who  I don't like  fan at all  he was fun  why are you  looking at me  I'm just asking  who doesn't  like who  I thought you guys  all got along  and I actually  I assume that  you all piled up  on E-Rock  but are there  is there other  tension between  the guys  E-Rock  you would see it  E-Rock 
[04:06:00]  who doesn't  like who  I don't know  this  I thought we had  cleared a lot  of this shit up  apparently  we did  and then  you heaped more  shit in there  so there's that  don't just dismiss  my fucking  I'm not dismissing it  are you habitually late  habitually no  a lot  no  but it happens  more than everyone else  that was the best  case of realize  what he was about  to say  you're ever going to see  so Ethan thinks 
[04:06:30]  you were dismissing  his place  I think this all  goes back to the  thank you  the daily news lottery  thing  thank you Bill K  from Philly  no that I could  care less  well you're rich  we all know  well yes  because I live  in Manhattan  so yeah  who else doesn't  like who  what's going on  here  come on  it's not my  it's not my  position to be  throwing other people  on the bus  yes it is  you're not throwing  them into the bus  they fucking  they painted  fucking yellow  stripes on you  so buses would  use you as a  speed bump  long way to go  so why don't you  just tell the 
[04:07:00]  truth  lately I haven't  heard anything  towards me  I've heard  towards other  people  who  Danny on the  phone there  I've heard other  people having  problems with  Danny  oh Jesus  and I've  stayed out of  everything  after we go  home  who  I'm not  doing this  well you can't  say that  and then not  say who  if they have a 
[04:07:30]  problem with him  they can feel  free to step up  and voice their  opinion on it  I'll say a name  and just say yes  or no  is it Steve  that's one of  them  okay  oh there's  there's more  what was the  problem  the Steve and  Danny thing  is well known  well documented  yeah  no if there's  other people who  have other  problems on this  staff it's there  let them come up  and say it's not  for me to throw  them under the  bus  you you have a  problem with  Danny  no I haven't  really interacted 
[04:08:00]  with Danny much  yeah  in the last few  months  what's up  there  there's really just  no  no camaraderie  not much  common ground  as far as the  shows can  Eric and my  responsibilities fall  on opposite ends  of the spectrum  so there's really  not a lot of  need to interact  during the day  well what was  you say other  people have  problems what  was their  problems relating  to you don't  have to say  who  there's various  issues  stop languishing  in vagaries  and fucking say  something of 
[04:08:30]  substance  should they all  write down  something blindly  and I'll just  read it  ah there you  go  that's the way  a blind vote  you guys want to  write stuff down  blindly and I'll  just read them  are we up for that  or is that  that's good  or is that too  destructive  oh god  it'll definitely  stay blind  and you won't  spend the rest of  the show getting  to the bottom  of who is saying  what  thank you  just say  how about 
[04:09:00]  just have us  write down  who we don't  like and why  it's nail on the  head then  how about  if we promise  just to read  blindly  some of the  issues  and then we'll  leave  just blind  we'll just  read them  and leave  then it'll  just fester  behind the  scenes  we'll read  them  and leave  and then  let you guys  mop this whole  mess up  yeah  exactly  alright  so  so everybody  so I guess  everyone's okay  now  I'm not convinced  with E-Rock's  eyes  E-Rock  I'm fine 
[04:09:30]  you're misunderstood  aren't you  I think you have  a time management  problem myself  if you want to  get into it  I think you're  very valuable  to the show  but I think  you waste  way too many  hours on  dumb stuff  like we have  a guy that  said you called  him in the  middle of the  night just to  make sure  Jim Norton  had his  like  he had  tickets for  the New  Year's Eve  show or  something  no they were  all called  at 6pm  this guy says  it was the  middle of the  night  yeah good  for him  maybe it 
[04:10:00]  was 6pm  here but  it was  midnight  in London  the promoter  had done  his job  and instead  of me having  to call  and tell  everybody  why would  you have  to do that  that would  have been  Kenny  because I  was responsible  for getting  all their  names in the  first place  and when the  promoter  didn't call  them  why was that  your responsibility  that's what I'm  saying I think  you take on a lot  of like stuff  you don't have to  take away  yeah  okay  it was on both  sides  we collected the  names here I  think it was the  promoter supposed to  call them and he  didn't and he never  called them so I  called everybody to  make sure if they  got their information  they didn't we 
[04:10:30]  were on vacation  too so what the  fuck does that  even matter  that's a good  point tell these  guys what you  told me privately  go ahead  erock  I don't know  what that was  go ahead  go ahead  erock  that private  conversation we  have  just bring it  up  no let's get  out in the  open  come on get  out in the  open what  are you doing  erock  you know that  time we  talked  it's cancer if  you don't  fucking get  stuff out  yeah  it clogs  the arteries  yeah the  mayonnaise isn't 
[04:11:00]  doing that  stop it with  the wittacisms  stop with  the uh  just be serious  and answer  what's the  private conversation  there is no  private conversation  I don't think  open lies  not his nature  no I would  then he recalls  it differently  because I don't  remember a  private conversation  well hope does  the boss recalls  you recall  yeah  yeah I'm sure  that's not being  made up to kill  more time  it's 11  we don't need to  kill time  time wasting  bag of shit  is that what you  call the boss  I don't like it  no I  when I first  started here  here we go  all right  I could tell 
[04:11:30]  hope was fishing  around  um  I  was  Eric's  subordinate  what  that's  what the fuck  was that about  that was  what I call  the past  uh huh  um  uh  and I  would  Eric  would show  me how  to do  things  because  he  had  more  responsibilities  when  I  you know  I was an  intern  when I  started  and Eric  would show  me things  maybe things  have changed 
[04:12:00]  but his  general M.O.  was to be  like okay  we're gonna  do this  later  and then  I'd stop  by and  he'd be  on AIM  uh  you know  or he'd  be  look you  know  on PAL  talk or  something  like  I have  seen  bad  time  management  on your  part  Eric  I don't  mean to  interrupt  but  Blue Healer  from Kentucky  he writes  Danny hasn't  flushed once  during this  entire  invention  fuck you  I just  shit  on the phone  you guys  didn't even  hear it  I was waiting  for big 
[04:12:30]  laughs  and no one  even  mentioned  it  yeah  fuck you  yeah  what are you  pouring  fucking  soup  into the  toilet  bowl  that old  gag  I mean  linger  longer  or maybe  tear down  a wall  that I  didn't  want  to  all right  anyway  go ahead  then  so there's  tension there  because  E-Rock  was technically  your boss  when you first  started  and now  you're his  boss  that's got  to be  very  uncomfortable  E-Rock  I'm cool  with it  oh okay  for Eric  who do you 
[04:13:00]  think Eric  could be doing  more to help  I was pissed  over  it's the way  everybody wanted  it  so who do  you think  I don't need  more help  I'm good  it was a sad  day when  E-Rock  was passed  over  because it  was his  gig  to lose  and he  certainly  you know  it's kind  of like  the Tom  Brady  thing  like  Tom  Brady  wasn't  supposed  to  lose  that  Super Bowl  when it  happened  and E-Rock  was passed  up  and I'm not  going to lie  to you  I was kind  of sad  but we had  no choice  in the matter  because he  fucked up  too many  times  what happened  E-Rock  I don't even 
[04:13:30]  know this  I don't want  to get into  it  well can you  tell me  briefly  I don't  know this  stuff  you gotta  tell me  I don't  know  and I  think  E-Rock's  bummed  to this  day  that he  blew  a big  opportunity  it's enough  to make  someone want  to kill  themselves  I understand  that  what happened  you gotta tell  us now  it's not in the  open  why  because it's  not  it's not a  secret  it's a work  issue  I wasn't  allowed to  talk about  it  why  because that's  what I had  to sign  you had to  sign something  you had to  sign something 
[04:14:00]  we were  taught  I'm not  going into  no I'm  not going  into  I didn't  have to  sign  anything  you don't  have to  go all  the way  into  it  just  briefly  so we  have an  idea  no  but  no  I don't  have to  we already  we disclose  all kinds  of stuff  on the  show  is it  incriminating  no it's  not  incriminating  but it  got  somebody  got upset  about something  that happened  Steve  so  who got  upset  yeah  it was you 
[04:14:30]  that got  upset right  no it  wasn't  Steve  I think  I know  what Eric's  talking about  and if  if it is  if it is  what he's  talking about  then yeah  there's a  piece of  paper he  signed  that dictates  he can't  talk about  it  but you  can't  Steve  I can't  actually  I can't  you signed  the paper  it was just  this whole  it was  see now  I hate  talking in  these vagaries  because  at one point  something happened  to Eric  which  sort of  is  related to  his being  passed over  that he can't  talk about  what happened  to Eric 
[04:15:00]  somebody mean  to him  I mean  what  no no no  it's not  no not  somebody mean  to him  but something  happened  people are  suggesting  he got  raped in  the bathroom  is that  it  sexual  harassment  Eric  what happened  to you  that was  bad  I know it  had something  to do with  sexual harassment  but who  was with  no who  wasn't  had nothing  to do  with that  no  no  oh we  just don't  want to  talk about  that  no  I'm just 
[04:15:30]  shaking my  head  I only  care what  Eric does  when it  affects the  rest of  the show  if he can  stay here  till four  every day  so how  are we  going to  solve this  should we  just fire  somebody  get it  over with  yeah  E-Rock  so how  are we  going to  solve this  are you  going to  try to  get in  at five  and humor  us  or no  you get  like maybe  another  alarm clock  or something  I don't  know call  me crazy  but I  don't think  you should  be here  later than  the stars  of the  show  it's 
[04:16:00]  like when  Letterman  goes to  work you  know I  don't think  his producers  show up  after Letterman  gets to  work if you  know what I  mean  there's a  valid point  saying that  the men on  the bus  fucking ads  should  I understand  when people  are late  because things  happen here  and there  but when  you're  continually  coming in  after the  the guys  that the  show's named  after it  could cause  problems  inside the  organization  with a lot  of people  I have a  solution  oh boy  no 
[04:16:30]  this would  actually be  positive  yes  there was a  time  this is not  going to have  Ray's and  Eric in the  same sentence  there was a  time when  we did closely  monitor when  you came in  and you  did for a  time when  you were  getting in  trouble for  it  a fair  job  of  coming in  on time  why don't  you do  what you  were doing  then  all the  time  I bet  you if  we put  a little  light  bucket  in the  office  and every  time  you're  late  you have  to throw  a little  money  in the 
[04:17:00]  bucket  you're  not  going to  be  late  anymore  that's  right  nickel  bucket full  of nickels  then we'll  see  or we  take  your  calories  and  for  every  minute  you're  late  we  take  calories  away  from  you  that  wouldn't  make  you happy  now  would  yeah  but  he  could  were you  sad  when  Thang  got the  position  you  didn't  honestly  honestly  no  really  why  because  you just  want to  be known  as  mediocre  your  whole  career  holy 
[04:17:30]  shit  no I'm  not even  like  people  like  oh wow  shocking  line  by  oh  but  that's  bullshit  everyone  out there  no matter  what you  fucking  do  when  someone  passes  you  up  you're  fucking  pissed  off  and  you're  not  pissed  off  let  a  congo  line  around  here  pass  you  up  next  thing  you know  Pat Duffy  will pass  you up  you won't  be pissed  off  at that  or Sam  or any  of these  other  guys  that's  bullshit  dude  I'd be  fucking  furious  and I know 
[04:18:00]  you're pissed  off  so why don't  you be  honest  about it  I wasn't  pissed  at him  okay  but you  were  pissed  at  oh boy  here it  comes  who  were  you  pissed  at  was I  pissed  at  the  situation  yes  was I  pissed  at  myself  yes  but that  was it  I was  never  pissed  at  him  and  what  did  you  do  wrong  I think  a lot  of people  know  that I'm  E-Rock's  biggest  supporter  I was  like  what a  dope  no offense  but what  a  dope  you let  these  guys  pass  you  by  now  I mean  they've  shown  their worth  around here  obviously 
[04:18:30]  but at  the time  it was  your gig  it was  your  fucking  gig  and by  the way  everyone's  agreeing  with me  when you're  passed up  for a  promotion  you're  fucking  pissed  I don't  care  what  what  career  you're  in  yeah  no  I was  pissed  I was  not  pissed  at  him  who  were you  mad at  I was  mad  at the  situation  I was  mad at  myself  Don  Wicklund  probably  yeah  were you  mad at  Wicklund  maybe  Wicklund  yeah  come on  it would be a  flat out  no if it  was a 
[04:19:00]  no  right  do you  think  Wicklund  does a  good  job  were you  mad at  Don  and his  fucking  his  blue  eyes  oh  does he  dreamy  like  Sinatra  mixed in  with  fucking  where  you  mad at  Don  and his  acting  like  a  tough  guy  routine  that  he  does  yeah  well  we got  a few  looks  for that  one  Sinatra  mixed in  with  Norman  Bates  so  how 
[04:19:30]  are we  going to  settle  this  who  are you  mad at  let's  go out  for some  drinks  there we  go  well  of course  Danny  would  suggest  that  how  about  a  bare  bottom  spanking  what  oh  sorry  I like  the  money  jar  idea  that  would  probably  work  don't  you  want  to  why  when  you  want  to  be  here  at  five  that  means  you'd  have  to  probably  maybe  go  to  bed  slightly  earlier  do a  little  time  management  action  so  you  don't  waste  your  time  on  tasks 
[04:20:00]  that  maybe  some  other  guys  could  do  we  have  fucking  20  guys  that  work  behind  the  scenes  I know  and I get  criticized  for that  too  so pretty much  anything I do  what do you get criticized at  alright  a lot of the times  the interns are sitting around  if they're not doing food runs  and if they're not printing out feedback  a lot of them are just sitting around doing nothing  so a few of them who had audio editing experience  I have them do some archiving  they compile a bunch of stuff that we have stacked together into one disk  and then we put all that together 
[04:20:30]  Pat does that on a regular basis because he's trustable  Matt has started to do it a little bit  but because if I have the interns doing anything  automatically somebody jumps up  why are they doing this  what are they doing  because it was me who asked them to do something  and I don't think anybody has a problem with that if  as long as it doesn't interfere with their other duties  and it doesn't  that's actually  that's good delegation  yeah  yeah that's fine  does Iraq communicate with like  some of these thoughts that he has  I do with Steve a lot 
[04:21:00]  yeah  there's a lot of times  there's stuff going on  I say look Steve  I need somebody to do this  while I'm doing something else  or I need somebody to help me with this  or can Derek make something to add  to a worst of or what not  I'm always doing that  Iraq is it true you blamed Steve for your situation  Steve?  no  who do you blame?  okay  nice try  well we blamed you?  no a little bit  don't blame Steve  but you kind of do right?  there's got to be not so much blame  but resentment 
[04:21:30]  a little bit of resentment  that they kind of went up  the ladder and you didn't  I would have some resentment there  for certain people  okay  but how long is that supposed to last?  it could last a lifetime  yeah  can I get a song?  what resentment's all about  can I get a song?  who do you think you are?  I need a song  can I get a song?  Coke Logic  suggested a fine song  can we play Tranquilizer?  I think it's called by  White Stripes  featuring 
[04:22:00]  featuring Lou Reed  I believe  I want to end with that song today  do you know the song?  is it the Killers?  that's the Killers with Lou Reed?  yeah  oh man  you like it right?  yeah  alright  we're going to turn you on to a new song tonight  or today  tonight  alright  I guess we're going right  well I want to play a little  Everybody Hurts  because Coke Logic suggested it  so  Steve  what's your thing?  you got your headphones on  you got a phone call  Steve  we're  Ant and I and Jimmy  we're going to like 
[04:22:30]  you know  hit the road  you clean up this mess  alright  good luck to you  before we go though  thanks  can we ask Iroch  can we ask Iroch  now I wonder why nobody likes me  because I love Eric  you like teasing him  Iroch  what would you like to do  to remedy this situation?  what do you feel  you're misunderstood with?  like the guys give you  a hard time  a lot of times  you're very underrated  what do you think  you're being underrated with?  you feel like the loner  in this organization  don't you?  no not necessarily  do you have friends?  who's your ally 
[04:23:00]  in this whole  whole room?  uh  I don't know  maybe Travis  but  Sam  Steve  wow  you guys actually get along?  I thought you guys hated each other  no  no  Eric and I get along very well  I don't think anyone  dislikes Eric  as a person  and nobody  is saying that  he doesn't do  a lot of work around here  maybe  I can't hear Danny  Danny says I do  Danny says I do  but he's also  very fucked up  he's being proposed to 
[04:23:30]  by a liquor bottle  bonus show line of the day  I was gonna go  I forget  I had a waitress line  anybody else want another  so  that's funny  I know man  I just fucked it all up  anyway  so you get along with  E-Rock  yeah I get along with  Eric sure  and  he just has  awful time management  you really do  E-Rock  that's like the theme 
[04:24:00]  right now  how do you feel  that Dan treats you  like you know  your relationship with him  is a bit tumultuous  can you turn up  everybody hurts  yeah  this is getting emotional  I'd like to hear  your take on that E-Rock  I don't have a problem  with Dan personally  I really don't  alright how about this  we go around the room  I know where we're getting at  from 1 to 10  yes everybody hurts  of course  from 1 to 10  like grade everybody  if you have a problem  with them  ok  that's fair  1 being the 
[04:24:30]  you really have a  fucking  you want to fucking  punch this person  in the face  no 10 is punch  in the face  yeah 10 is punch  in the face  0 is nothing  0 is like you get along  and you know  you would almost  marry the dude  yeah start  let's go  alright start with Steve  from 0 to  hold on  that's a little hard  because  that time period  has come and gone  ok well  alright let's go back  a little bit  in general terms  0 to 10  how would you rate Steve  10 meaning  you want to  punch him in the face  come on 
[04:25:00]  Steve's a 0  so you want to  have such a number  wow  yeah that's  thanks  good to know  that your boss  is a non-issue  that's wonderful  how about Sam  Sam  Sam ranges  from a 3 to 5  depending on the day  and the situation  fuck  congrats Sam  Travis  Travis is a 0  because  I'm afraid  I said 0 is like  you want to have  sex with a guy  oh yes  you're in dude  come on  stop being diplomatic  fuck off  I'm not being diplomatic  but the time period 
[04:25:30]  no no this is good  because he gave  Sam a 3 to 5  and these guys 0  so  fan  fan ranges  in the 3 to 5  but not for the same  reason that Sam  ranges in the 3 to 5  what do I do  I can't believe  Sam and I  I don't do anything  alright  as soon as they  rag at something  you come in  I don't know why  they're doing that  I don't know  who gave them  I don't know  what this is all about  I just came in  and saw my friend  Than yelling at my  friend Eric 
[04:26:00]  oh right  like the night  we went to that  wrestling thing  and you told them  about oh Eric  because I was in pain  from the surgery  that I couldn't  eat anything  that's what I told them  and they made a joke  out of it  okay then  one you told them  two then you came over  and you said  look I got your back  I don't know why  they're doing this to you  you tried to ease the pain  after pouring salt  in a wound  no I told them  that you were in pain  and that it was  actually kind of hard  for me  yeah but Sam  when you come over  and you give the lovey eyes  you go  I don't know why  they're doing this to you  and you put like  the hand on the shoulder 
[04:26:30]  yeah  like you're reaching out  yeah  Eric just in case  what  Eric just in case  you're wondering too  Sam did come to us  with a smile on his face  and couldn't wait  to give us the advice  of course he did  that is not true  we gotta keep it fair here  we gotta keep it fair  alright  so Thans  so what's the difference  between  Than and Sam's  three to five  um  no  Sam's three to five  is just  he's being a smartass  and he's trying to lie to you  it's tact  he's trying to make you feel good 
[04:27:00]  even though  he's totally fucking you  at that point  I just want you to feel good  right  so  that's Sam's issue  Than  you're saying  he plays both sides  kind of like  oh he's very good at it  he plays his blackness  against his whiteness  yes  to the point  to the  to the point  to the point  where  you just want to punch him  there's many times  Steve wants to just  grab him by the face  and throw him  keep it on you  why  which one  Sam  Sam  yeah sure  Sam's a little shitster  every once in a while  yeah  alright  and now we get to  why is Than different 
[04:27:30]  admit it  Than is a little different  because  whether and  whether it's work  or not work  sometimes he  he just  he'll come up to you  and say something  or just give  off an impression  like  he  he  he resents  or  he feels slighted  or something  and sometimes  I don't get it  slighted  I'm fucking  king shit around here  okay  right  and finally  Danny  alright 
[04:28:00]  this is where  I say  this is the real issue  this is where I say  that  the point  that time period  of where  this would be  is long past  because Danny and I  have said a lot of this stuff  there were a lot of times  I just wanted to  just cave Danny's head in  or there were times  I'm sure that  he wanted to do  the same to me  Danny  you can't ask Danny  a question without him  just turning and yelling  in your face  and it's not even English  he's just making  gibberish or noises  what the fuck  he's describing 
[04:28:30]  a mongoloid  yeah  or  or an alcoholic  if you ask him for something  sorry Danny  was too easy  well it's not  he's not even yelling  he just would scream  and make weird sounds  at you  while you're trying  to ask  it's like look  Oak needs to know  where this is  a monkey  a monkey  am I wrong  at this  what sound  oh Sam  oh see you're shaking  your head yes  and then going no  you got Sam  as an ally  on this one 
[04:29:00]  what sounds  no Danny  Danny used to give off  an attitude  anytime  you know what  I know how to handle this  Sam  I mean  imitate Danny  I'm just saying  maybe  so that's Danny's reaction  to where is something  well it depends  who's asking him  too  yeah  sometimes  E-Rock's questions  are met with  more short tempered answers  yeah  yeah  which it's not even 
[04:29:30]  English answering you  you'll just sit there  and just go  like that  and you're like  what the fuck  just happened  I gotta say  the chemistry  is a little weird here  I think we need  like a blockbuster trade  really  I say we go  blockbuster trade  with Ron and Fez  hmm  blockbuster trade  well who would we  have to trade off  to alleviate  everyone for Lily  that's what we gotta figure out  blockbuster trade time  well it seems that  it seems like  the common denominator  in the friction  is E-Rock 
[04:30:00]  like if you get rid  of E-Rock  you pretty much  solve  the  the problem  amongst everybody else  because it's all  but that's  what the Knicks are saying  about Stefan Marbury  but they're thinking  he's like the franchise  you know  E-Rock likes to think  of himself as  like the  LeBron James  of the Opie and Anthony  show  so  think like a  so you're thinking  E-Rock  maybe Eastside Dave  well I don't know  I don't know  like blockbuster trades  you gotta sit down  and think it over  and see what makes sense  see I think 
[04:30:30]  if you lose E-Rock  then you'd have to  divvy up his responsibilities  and that includes  all the stuff  that he's doing  after the show  see I've  I've let it  be known  that I really want  Bronx Johnny  so I think it's  time to  like figure out a trade  Bronx Johnny  maybe yeah  he's really good  oh yeah  I want Bronx Johnny  plus I would be depressed  if Eric was gone  shut up  what  he's just lying  maybe we have to  split up the  Thane and Sam  thing  eh well  he had a good run  Sam 
[04:31:00]  you know  Shaq and  fucking Kobe Bryant  had to split up  eventually  right  sure  so  alright blockbuster  trade time  with Ron and Fez  that's what I'm  thinking  yeah  maybe we just  try for a couple  weeks  why you looking  at me  oh  alright so  Danny's what  Danny used to be  a 10  wow  wow  what is he like  right now  is he around  a 3  3 to 5 
[04:31:30]  like the other  two or  a little higher  still  he might be  actually a little  lower  he might be  I'd say a 3  because Danny  doesn't do it  that often anymore  yeah  like he actually  will address  somebody speaking  to him now  I like Sam's  impression  what you were  talking about  but I think  I think  Ron and Fez  need to come in  early  at 11  and we have  an afro sit down  yeah  and discuss  a blockbuster  trade  we put all  their people  on one side  all our people  on one side 
[04:32:00]  and we can  kind of trade  well it's got to be  they can't listen  to that hour of radio  well no  this is like  closed door meetings  this is like  you know  the winter meetings  okay  we need to do  the winter meetings  with other GMs  I'm sure he'd like  Sam  huh  I'm sure Ron  would like Sam  why  why is that  Ron has Sam  on a lot  alright well  we'd like  Ron's Johnny  I'll make that  trade tomorrow  oh sorry  Sam  I thought you  left the room  how about this  how about this 
[04:32:30]  Mark's not only  comes in once a week  see I can't trade  Sam because my  fiance loves his  girl  that would  that would  create all sorts  of tensions  they could still  be friends  how does this work  we'll give you  Steve and Anthony  for Lily  just destroy  the whole show  oh boy  that music  huh  wait can I  play my song  no  tomorrow  why  because  unless it's  less than  two minutes  the computer's  coming  oh my god  look at this  I can't play  my song
