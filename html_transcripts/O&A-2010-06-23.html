<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of the legal battle between the Naked Cowboy and Sandy Kane, a rival partially-naked Times Square performer.  The hosts, referring to Kane as a "lunatic" and "disaster," played numerous news reports showcasing Kane's eccentric behavior and claims, including her assertion that she was "naked before" the Naked Cowboy. The Naked Cowboy himself called in, explaining his perspective and his attempts to protect his trademark, stating he'd been lenient with Kane until her claim of his involvement in her music recordings. He mentioned his franchise and licensing agreements, admitting the franchise wasn't particularly successful.  Sandy Kane then joined the show, engaging in humorous and outrageous banter, boasting about lighting her nipples on fire.  A second "naked cowgirl," also licensed by the Naked Cowboy, was mentioned, with allegations of her actions and relationship with the Naked Cowboy fueling speculation and humorous commentary from the hosts.  The hosts placed a bet on whether Kane would use profanity during future news appearances.  The segment ended with continued discussion of the legal battle and Kane's ongoing performances.

The show then transitioned to a discussion of General Stanley McChrystal's dismissal following the critical Rolling Stone article.  The hosts discussed Kane's potential *Good Morning America* appearance, her alleged claim that Opie inspired her toplessness, and the Vaseline-like effect on the camera during her previous TV appearances.  They also shared an anecdote about their intern fleeing upon seeing Opie in public.  Sandy Kane's explicit song, "Tits My Party," was played. The McChrystal controversy dominated the discussion, with numerous callers debating the general's actions and the President's response.  Callers weighed in on whether McChrystal's actions were calculated, a result of poor judgment, or something else. His past controversies, including the Pat Tillman incident, were also mentioned.  Speculation on the political ramifications ensued.  In-studio guest Patrice O'Neal offered his perspective. News broke that McChrystal had arrived at the Pentagon. The show briefly discussed a documentary about Carlos Mencia's joke-theft admissions.

The next segment focused heavily on the Carlos Mencia joke-theft documentary, with Patrice O'Neal, still in-studio, dissecting Mencia's confession.  The hosts and O'Neal debated the ethical implications and impact on comedy, referencing Mark Maron's podcast interviews. They discussed the difficult lives of comedians, including poor conditions in some comedy clubs and the toll on relationships.  Rich Shiner's comeback was briefly mentioned. The segment then dramatically shifted back to Sandy Kane and another unnamed "naked cowgirl," returning to the legal dispute with the Naked Cowboy.  The conversation became highly sexually charged and vulgar, including personal attacks between Kane, the other cowgirl, and the hosts.  The segment concluded with short musical performances by Kane and the other cowgirl.

A subsequent segment heavily featured Sandy Kane and the younger "naked cowgirl," focusing on Kane's experiences, including graphic details of multiple rape claims against various individuals, including Richard Pryor and a trucker.  She discussed her lawsuit against the Naked Cowboy, alleging betrayal and misuse of her song, "He Taught Me How to Love," which was played, containing explicit sexual lyrics.  Her drug use, past relationships, and current struggles were also discussed.  The younger cowgirl briefly shared her experiences.  Patrice O'Neal remained as a guest.  The hosts interacted with a mixture of teasing, sympathy, and disbelief while discussing the lawsuit and the Naked Cowboy's career. The segment concluded with Sandy Kane's song and promotion of her website, nakedcowgirlny.com.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Our show is stupid.  This is so irresponsible.  This should be illegal.  It really should be.  It's like, it's so unethical.  God, I hate fucking radio.  This could be the worst audio ever.  Shut up. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, yeah, fucking mouth.  This is terrible.  We just suck all around.  I hope you show restraint in fucking my girlfriend.  This stinks.  Fucking shut the fuck up.  We get it.  We get it.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yes, let's do that.  All right.  It's on the road.  There it is.  Past the on-ramp.  Accelerating.  The show's on the road. 
[00:01:00]  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Hi, everybody.  Seems like we're living the same fucking day over and over again.  Yeah, yeah.  Just footage of the oil spill.  That's all you see.  Over there, footage of the oil spill.  We got eight TVs in studio.  There's some wetlands with oil on it.  There's a pelican with oil on it.  There's an oil slick.  There's a boom.  Trying to contain it.  I never thought it would be two months of this shit every fucking day.  Just clean up the goddamn oil. 
[00:01:30]  Let's go.  Clean it up.  So we can move on to other shit.  They just need a new story.  There hasn't been a new big story.  This thing will, you know.  Yeah, but we're getting tired of this series.  Yeah.  When's the season finale?  Is it going to be picked up for another season?  The oil spill show?  Sounds like it just might.  The oil spill show.  It is a show.  It's all shows.  Yeah, that's not enough. 
[00:02:00]  It's getting old.  I don't even know what to call her.  I was going to say our pal.  I don't know if she's our pal, but Sandy Cain is all over the fucking place, and she's  going to be doing an interview with us today, I guess.  I guess we have to treat this like a real interview with Sandy Cain.  Are you kidding?  After all the years of throwing garbage on her and just humiliating her, she's coming  in today to talk about what the fuck's going on with her in Times Square.  It's time to get money from me, man. 
[00:02:30]  Supposedly, she's going to be on Channel 11 in a few minutes here.  Yeah.  I hope all these news outlets understand that she is completely out of her mind.  Out of her fucking mind.  She should be on 11?  Yeah.  That's why we've been watching Channel 11 here.  I don't know.  Are they expecting an interview?  Yes.  Like, oh, yes, well, I am not going to pay.  I think it's a freedom to be able to go out.  No.  They're going to get, yeah, yeah, what are you going to do?  I was raped.  Yeah.  I love when she says, man. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, man.  Man.  Man.  Oh, man.  Man.  Let me see your cock.  No.  What are you, gay?  I'm going to sing one of my songs.  I love dick.  Yeah.  She's going to sing her I love dick song.  Or are we going to get a normal Sandy Kane on the news today?  No way.  There isn't a such thing.  Right?  So, Sandy, what do you think about this naked cowboy thing?  I don't play it. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh.  Really?  Can we quote you there?  Good for Sandy Kane, though.  That stupid naked cowboy sucks a dick.  I never liked the naked cowboy.  He wants his franchise money.  Five G's for the year or 500 a month.  Well, somehow he got that done.  Somehow he was able to copyright or, right?  Copyright the whole naked cowboy shtick.  That's his.  He's basically a panhandler with good abs. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  And he was able to franchise the whole fucking thing.  Yeah.  So you think like all of his money comes from him just having his picture taken with rubes  in Times Square, which he makes a nice dime doing that.  But he's apparently getting money from other bums in other cities that are doing the naked  cowboy shtick.  Well, that's what I want to know.  He sets up this whole franchise business.  How many are there?  Are there other naked cowboys in other cities?  I know.  That's just it.  I know there's a naked cowgirl that is franchised through him in Times Square. 
[00:04:30]  I heard a while ago that they were married, but I guess that's not true.  Or maybe it was his chick and they broke up and she's still doing the naked cowgirl anyway.  Maybe.  And the naked cowgirl is coming in as well.  Oh, really?  So we got the naked cowgirl coming in today and we got Sandy Kane coming in today who's  doing her own thing.  No.  And now you got this douche, the naked cowboy, trying to like shake down Sandy Kane for a  few bucks.  Good luck, naked cowboy.  I think you met your match with this fucking lunatic. 
[00:05:00]  Sandy Kane is barely, barely not homeless.  She is a metal patient.  I cannot wait.  Is the naked cowgirl that's coming in here the only one that was in New York or were there  more?  I don't know.  What do you know, Steve?  Sorry.  The one that...  Nothing.  Why would you say sorry right off the bat?  Sorry I coughed. 
[00:05:30]  You now have AIDS.  V.  V.  I don't have AIDS.  Okay, well.  Of course.  Will you just talk?  The naked cowgirl that's coming in is the only one that is officially licensed to perform  as a naked cowboy, cowboy, cowgirl performer.  The term naked cowboy is trademarked and he licenses out that product. 
[00:06:00]  Okay, I got all that.  I got all that.  Is this the broad right there?  Yeah.  Is that her?  She's coming in?  No.  No.  Because it says the naked cowgirl.  I don't know, dude.  It might be the naked cowgirl.  I'm thinking of somebody else.  Is this her?  I'm thinking of somebody else.  I think so, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  So wait.  He franchised a naked cowboy and so far he only has one franchise under his belt?  I spoke to him yesterday.  I think that's all he's got.  I think he wants to franchise it out to, or license the property out to a bunch of different 
[00:06:30]  acts.  Naked Indian, naked whoever.  But it sounds like this is the only one he's got paying right now.  He's going to start a bunch of naked things like Indians and fucking construction workers.  I think ultimately that's why he chose people.  Why isn't that asshole coming in today?  He doesn't want to because he's currently litigating with Sandy, so he doesn't want to  quote unquote trivialize it by coming on a radio show.  He's been begging to be on our show forever.  Litigating.  Now we have an interest to have his stupid ass on our show and he's turning us down? 
[00:07:00]  Yes.  Is it because of her going to be here?  Yes.  Is it because Sandy's going to be here?  Yes.  He won't come on.  Would he come on without her?  I'll ask him.  Maybe he'd come on without her and he just doesn't want to start a radio.  You should ask him that ahead of time.  We could split these people up.  I don't care.  There's finally a reason to have him on the show.  Who cares when he's not in litigation and on the news?  What are we going to talk to him about?  Oh, I hear you wear two underpants because your cock sticks through your one pair. 
[00:07:30]  You know what is astounding?  It says, naked cowboy to naked cowgirl.  Stop copying me.  That's from Channel 2 News over here on the website.  Channel 2 News.  It's everywhere.  This fucking story.  I don't know why the news picked up on this.  The thing is, Sandy Kane isn't the naked cowgirl.  Like, the naked cowgirl is the one that paid for it, but Sandy's getting this publicity as the naked cowgirl and she's just a disaster with a hat.  I know.  She looks like she's melting.  She's a fucking disaster. 
[00:08:00]  Sam has a little info on this because he went down to Times Square.  Oh, on the scene reporter?  That's right.  And Sam was on TV looking really annoyed as he was waiting for the real media to finish their interviews with Sandy Kane so he could goof on her.  The CW and ABC last night, primetime Sam Roberts, media superstar.  Wow.  Did you yell out, O&A?  No.  So what happened down there?  Well, was she at normal Sandy Kane?  No.  I mean, she was Sandy Kane, Sandy Kane.  As a matter of fact, the ABC reporter was just getting her to do, like, B-roll stuff, and they asked her to sing a song. 
[00:08:30]  And so she just asked her her name, the reporter, and the reporter said Donna.  So she's just strumming Donna.  And then she said, Donna in the house.  And then she stopped and she looked at Donna and said, we're on ABC, but I usually say in the fucking house.  Oh, shit.  Rumor has it she's going to be on Good Morning America today, too. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, no.  Roll your fucking DVRs today.  While she was talking to the CW, like, people were walking by and going, ugh.  Or, like, you know, just, and I started egging her on about being hot and stuff.  And so she actually, she was wearing pasties.  Oh, no.  And then the young naked cowgirl was across, like, down the street, and we could see her with her pasties on.  Yeah.  And so Sandy Cain was like, I'm going topless.  And you could hear, like, 14 people going, no, no.  And one guy, me, going, do it. 
[00:09:30]  You asshole.  And so she took off her top for the CW.  Sandy Cain should be famous.  Yeah.  She really needs to be famous.  She might be, because this story, I'm telling you, is everywhere.  And this is the genius.  The genius report.  I mean, you name it.  Not even for humor value, just because it was her instinct.  When people gave her $2 for her pictures, she lifted up her breast and put the $2 under her breast. 
[00:10:00]  It is instinctive with her being a stripper, burlesque act, whatever it is.  Just held it under her sagging breast.  She is a disaster.  Yeah, do it.  You got us a few clips from her media tour here.  Yeah, at Sandy Gate.  Sandy Gate, we're calling her out.  Ah, it's the name tour.  We need a sweeper.  This is how NBC is reporting the Sandy Cain thing.  New York City is laden with iconic landmarks.  The Empire State Building, Central Park, Times Square, and of course, the Naked Cowboy. 
[00:10:30]  He's got a crowd around him every time.  Now, all was well in the world of the naked until about two weeks ago, when a now public  feud erupted between the Naked Cowboy and the Naked Cowgirl.  The Naked Cowboy is obviously the brand.  One of the things we have is a franchise agreement that allows other people to, you know, capitalize  on putting on underwear, boots, and hat, calling themselves the trademark name Naked Cowboy,  and making dollars.  The other Naked Cowgirl, Sandy Cain, has kind of been under the radar for a period of time. 
[00:11:00]  There are things that we...  As well as a rock.  She's put under a lot of things.  Here it is.  The Naked Cowboy.  Oh, this is live.  We're back live.  I was excited to the story when she stops by live.  She's going to be live.  Oh, do they know what they're doing?  I thought this was going to be a taped piece.  Dude.  Oh, no.  She's live.  Dude, how much money you got?  Oh, I'm not making a bet that she drops the F-bomb.  Steve, get a hold of her immediately.  If she lays out a fine fucking barrage of curses, I got a solid $200. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  I got $200.  I'm in.  Where's Steve?  I'm in.  Where's Steve?  Thumbs up?  Call her right now.  Call her.  We got what?  Several hundred dollars.  Yes, yes.  I got $200.  Yes.  For her.  Steve, don't...  Four, five.  Sam, run down the hall and make sure the translation got to Steve.  We got $600.  I called CW and told them she'd be cursing. 
[00:12:00]  $600 if she fucking...  It's got to be over the...  Yeah, yeah.  It's got to be over the top.  Just C-bombs and F-bombs.  Oh, my God.  I want a motherfucker.  I want a...  Hey, motherfuckers.  How big is your dick?  She needs to just curse so much that they have to put up that we'll be right back.  Technical difficulties still.  That's the oldie time.  Technical difficulties.  Yes.  We're experiencing technical difficulties. 
[00:12:30]  Please stand by.  Yeah, man.  All right, man.  Guys are fucking ass.  Oh, man.  That's who he is.  A cock-sucking fucking asshole.  I want Sandy Cain to be a sensational guy.  Oh, yes.  What?  $600 if she...  There's the technical difficulties from The Simpsons, right?  Yeah.  Please stand by.  If she just loses her shit.  You got the translation to Steve?  Yeah.  Okay, good.  Here's the rest of the NBC report.  I think we can squeeze it in.  On the radar for a period of time, there are things that we feel that she's doing in her marketing 
[00:13:00]  that is inconsistent with the class of the Naked Cowboys.  It's just a matter of saying, look, you know, get under control, sign a franchise agreement,  or, you know, we're going to sue your pants on.  The problem arose when he was supposed to put his voice on a song that I recorded in Nashville,  and I said, gee, why don't you put your voice on it?  He says, yeah, if you pay me $5,000 for the year and sign these papers, I'll put my voice on that song. 
[00:13:30]  Why doesn't he call Sue the Bare Naked Cowgirls?  Why me?  The Bare Naked Ladies?  Bare Naked Ladies.  What, he owns Times Square?  He owns the word naked?  No, I don't think so.  Times Square is about the freedom of New York.  Oh, my God.  She's fucking crazy.  But she's better.  She's smarter on TV because she has, like, some media experience.  Yeah, yeah.  She's not as nuts.  Like, she actually makes an argument that some people will go, eh, eh, eh. 
[00:14:00]  You know, naked is naked.  It's Times Square.  The Bare Naked Cowboys.  The Bare Naked Cowboys, ladies.  Come on, man.  She has a genital wart the size of a fist.  It's giant.  They have no idea.  Hey, CW, let me show you Twato.  By the way, the other naked cowgirl told her that she should put her tips in the guitar, 
[00:14:30]  at which point she showed her that she could not because she's still using the guitar that  Opie smashed a giant hole in.  Why?  She never bought a new guitar with all the money I had to fucking give up that day?  That's why she's fucking pissed.  And that's why she's pissed?  I, I, oh, whatever.  Yeah.  All right, they're about to go live on 2011 here.  They're doing their soccer break.  Hey, man.  Big fucking World Cup game for the U.S. today.  Who are we playing?  I don't know.  I really don't know.  Well, Algeria.  But we have to win, and then we move on to the next round.  God, Danny just put the picture of Twato up. 
[00:15:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  Did you suck that, Danny?  It probably smelled like an armpit.  Oh.  Oh.  Someone popped that up on a website.  Danny, send that to me.  I'm going to tweet that.  I think you could tweet that.  Why not?  You don't see where it is.  It's just skin.  I'm sure we'll be fine.  All right.  I'm going to tweet fucking Twato.  Fuck it.  Fuck it.  Fuck it.  Well, what the hell, man?  Come on.  Pass there.  Suarez's header is good.  Eh.  Uruguay wins it 1-0. 
[00:15:30]  They might be teasing saying they came through the hour.  Algeria, that's today at 10 a.m.  That should be exciting.  Come on.  Okay, I don't want to sound like a silly girl, but Sakura has some, like, really cute guys.  I've heard this moment before, so.  Okay.  Not the first.  What happened to the mornings we used to have?  Just checking.  That is my sentiment this morning.  It's a whole new set.  Well, that's the same guy on the left.  Okay, coming up with what the state of New York is saying about punishing teen sexters.  And there's been a new discovery near the world.  Yeah, they're teasing her.  They're doing real news now in the morning.  Is this different than it used to be, or is this the way they always did it?  No, this is different.  This is a little different.  They're actually.  It feels like it's more newsy, yeah. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, and they have a different set with the open background to New York City.  And, like, didn't Suki was the one that was.  It just feels like a different vibe.  Like, I didn't even realize it was the same show until you pointed out that was the same guy.  Yeah, because it was all that wacky fucking, you know, dancers and stuff.  Maybe they went more legit.  Maybe people weren't watching as much.  It's kind of hard to get too souped up for nuttiness.  Is Jill still doing traffic over there?  Which entertainment is, right?  I don't know.  She should be more the entertainment person. 
[00:16:30]  Really?  Person.  She's good.  All right, here we go.  ABC reports on Sandy Kane.  We're going to continue with Sandy Gate here.  This is all the clips that happened last night.  Sandy Gate.  Sandy Gate.  This is how Robert Burke got people to listen to his music 13 years ago.  He got naked.  I was also a country singer at that point.  I went to the boardwalk and played in my clothes and was ignored.  Now it's his nationwide brand.  He takes his show on the road, but at home in Times Square.  Well, that should say a lot. 
[00:17:00]  You were ignored.  You were ignored because you sucked.  Dirk Bentley doesn't have to, you know, perform in his underpants.  That's right.  All the big country stars don't have to do this shit.  At home in Times Square, tourists eat it up.  The dollar and the guitar underwear is already full.  It's been trademarked since around 2000.  And this Burke considers trademark infringement.  Dollars in the house right here.  Sandy Kane, a stripper for upwards of 20 years, plays the guitar and sings partially naked, just a few feet away from Burke. 
[00:17:30]  His attorney is now asking her to sign a franchise agreement and pay a $500 monthly or $5,000 yearly franchise fee.  Or stop calling herself the naked cowgirl.  I'm the naked cowgirl.  I am not a boy.  She's got it all figured out.  Right on.  Unbelievable.  She gives great, like, quotes, though.  Oh, yeah.  I'm not a boy. 
[00:18:00]  I'm the naked cowgirl.  I am not living.  And we have another report here.  Okay.  She may not be much to look at, but Sandy Kane wants to...  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  They kicked it off.  Who said that besides everyone?  She may not be much to look at.  Or listen to.  Okay.  She may not be much to look at, but Sandy Kane wants to entertain New Yorkers in Times Square, 
[00:18:30]  not by striking sexy poses like the naked cowboy, but by making people laugh.  I'm going, Tom.  He's right now.  But as far as the naked cowboy is concerned, Sandy's not welcome.  Not because he's afraid his business might sag, but because she hasn't paid up.  The naked cowboy says Sandy needs to cough up $500 a month or $5,000 a year for a franchise  license for his trademark brand.  Sandy says she doesn't need any stinking papers.  For my dog, I do.  It's all BS.  $5,000? 
[00:19:00]  I don't make that.  You know, what do I make?  No, I think it's...  Listen, if I made $5 million, I wouldn't want to pay someone money that doesn't deserve it.  She does have great quotes.  What are they talking about?  Oh, weather.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, it's the same crew over there.  God, she is just fantastic.  The naked cowboy says Times Square is big enough for a dozen naked cowboys or cowgirls.  Louisa Holman is cashing in on the act and gladly paying the franchise fee. 
[00:19:30]  This is how I'm supporting myself and making some money to pay for school.  Now there's good news and bad news to this story, depending on which naked cowgirl you prefer.  The franchise one will be here only for the summer, and Sandy says she's not going anywhere.  I don't think he's got a leg to stand on.  As far as owning anything, this is Times Square.  That's the beauty of it.  It's free.  It's free, man. 
[00:20:00]  It's all about freedom and hippiness, man.  Did you rape me in 68?  Summer of love.  You go down there and just, you should just go down there and watch her interact with  the tourists every single, do you know how many times she uses the, hey, let's exchange  blood tests line?  Oh, no.  More than twice, three times a day?  Much more than that.  Old hackneyed expression.  Hey, let's exchange blood tests.  Eh, eh.  Yeah, look, they got her dressed up like a real fucking person. 
[00:20:30]  They just showed Jill, like, in a regular kind of dress thing instead of, uh...  Yeah, they changed their whole thing.  They're trying to do real news.  I wonder if they got a new, uh, new boss over there.  Probably got a new boss that was like, all right, not a shit-off.  Enough with the morning zoo crap.  Let's get back to the news.  Enough with your fucking Nick's dancers and fucking...  Yeah.  All right, well, Sam went down and talked to all the naked cow people.  Yeah.  You started with the naked cowboy? 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, I figure he was the one to start with.  Yeah.  Cowboy, uh, what made you decide to, to go through with, uh, making Sandy Kane finally  stop the nonsense with her stealing your bet?  Uh, well, again, there's kind of two personas going on at all times.  There's me, the friendly guy who's so happy with everybody, and that's sincerely the way  I am.  Uh, then I have a management team that actually protects the interests of my brand and does  everything.  It's TMR Management out of Nashville.  Um, so, again, as we talked about even on your show... 
[00:21:30]  Here.  Oh, you hear Sam?  Oh, yes, sure, sure, sure.  Mr. Understanding.  Like, it's a...  Friendly media.  Like, this is real journalism going on.  Sam is everything we hate in journalism.  Of course.  And we're reporters.  Of course.  Not a...  I am.  I like how you, um, lulled him into a sense of security, though, by saying Sandy Kane's  nonsense.  Like, just with the question, you were on his side.  Right.  Me and you, buddy.  Opening him up to tell you more.  And you're actually right.  It is nonsense.  She is stealing him.  And, yes, indeed, it was nonsense. 
[00:22:00]  It is his brand.  I mean, like it or not, he did create it and come up with it, and she is ripping it off  and saying that it's Times Square.  I should be allowed to steal.  He takes himself way too seriously.  Oh, yeah.  We're going to have him on in five minutes.  Steve got him to call the show.  By the way, I came up with the Naked Cowboy in 92.  I've already said this.  Yes, we did that yesterday.  Motherfuckers.  A song and everything.  I like that song.  Jesus.  Everybody, even on your show, I mean, she's been, you know, to me, she's somebody who's  just literally using the brand to try to scrape herself to a better situation. 
[00:22:30]  That's one thing.  But if you're recording, you know, multiple thousand dollar albums and then saying you're  using the Naked Cowboy, or he's actually singing on the tracks, I mean, that's just,  it makes, it's bad for several reasons.  Are you surprised that Sandy showed up here today?  Well, again, it almost seems like at this, now, because it seems like she's being serious,  I mean, I guess that she came out here after July 1st, because I know the cease and desist  says then.  Yeah.  And now she's taking such a stance, it's almost like she's just challenging you. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, if she wants to, if she wants, again, and again, she'll have the value of the media  relative to that.  Yeah.  I don't think, I don't know.  Well, I hope you're successful in putting her out of business.  Well, you know, you either play by the rules, or I'm going to sue your pants on.  I get it.  Oh, sue your pants on.  Oh, sue your pants on.  Oh, he's used that one a few times.  He, I watched so many news reports with this guy on it this morning, he must have used that  with every single journalist that walked by.  Sue your pants on.  Except sometimes he went, sue your pants on. 
[00:23:30]  Ah, like really.  Oh, it's like Michael Jordan?  Yeah, it really sort of.  Sue your pants on.  Sue your pants on.  Sue your, sue your pants on.  Is it, sue your pants on?  Got a few good ones in there.  Uh, Sandy comments on the accusations.  So Sandy, you're all over the news now.  Right.  Apparently the naked cowboy is tired of you stealing his, his gimmick.  Well, you know, I, I am very disappointed in the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:24:00]  Steve too.  What the fuck, boy, she's turning it on us.  She thinks that you guys aren't being very supportive.  Of this?  Yeah, she thinks you're not on her side.  Oh, let's make that clear that we are.  Steve too.  And?  I did not, I have not, I've been, was naked before him.  Before Steve?  Wait, when Steve talked to her on the phone yesterday, he was actually arguing with her  on the phone about how she had stolen naked cowboy's gimmick.  Aw.  Which I don't know why he was doing that, but that's why she is under the assumption 
[00:24:30]  that we're not on her side.  Aw, no.  What is he doing?  Why would you do that when you're trying to get somebody on the show?  I know.  Right, she could say no to us, and this is a big story.  No wonder we couldn't get Edward Norton.  He was the one doing it.  We would like to go on and attack him for two of his performances.  This is, what is he doing?  Before Steve?  No, I don't think you can copyright a word called naked.  He is the naked cowboy.  I am the naked cowgirl.  Well, you're wearing the same colors.  You're a cowboy and cowgirl. 
[00:25:00]  It's the same thing except for the gender.  You have a guitar.  I have hair.  I have a wig.  That's fine.  How do you know?  I've seen.  He doesn't have a wig.  No, he doesn't.  Now, that girl will be wearing the same outfit in two years, the same exact outfit.  That's the other naked cowgirl.  Yes, yes.  But the thing is, I did not copy him.  I copied her.  Okay, well, she copied him.  Right.  So you copied him indirectly. 
[00:25:30]  You know, it's just like, you were a reporter.  Right.  Who did you call?  Who was your mentor?  Walter Cronkite.  Okay.  Will Walter Cronkite sue you because you're a reporter?  Well, no.  Well, if I called myself Samter Cronkite, he might.  I am the naked cowgirl.  Girl.  Samter Cronkite.  Walter Cronkite's not suing anyone these days.  He's dead.  Samter Cronkite.  And she's actually like a sound machine with four responses. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, yeah.  I'm a naked cowboy.  I'm a naked cowgirl.  Cowgirl.  I see you can't say Mark naked.  I mean, I ain't.  We got the naked cowboy on our phone.  Naked cowboy, how are you?  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Thanks very much.  She's almost homeless, right?  Do you know her background at all?  Well, my sense since the very beginning, again, she's been in operation for a couple of years, 
[00:26:30]  and we've reached out to her to sign the franchise agreement, which was more about just formalizing her being out there  and making it clear that, you know, just anyone just can't go out in the Times Square exactly where I work and duplicate what I'm doing.  And she's basically just not been willing to do that.  And I felt the same way you did.  My feeling was that her circumstance didn't warrant being unjustly, you know, strict with her, that she wasn't in a position to, you know, necessarily defend herself or anything else. 
[00:27:00]  And that's why it's slid under the radar for several years.  And when she recently started promoting a new song and making an album for over $10,000, she claimed, with BMI and this and that,  and she's advertising that I'm actually singing on it, we came to her and said we would be willing to even sing on it 
[00:27:30]  because she was going to be a national thing as I was for CMA.  In other words, you can't say it's me, but not even me.  That's probably even illegal.  That's true.  We agreed.  We agreed to do it.  We agreed to do that.  All right, I understand.  Okay, I understand all that, but you do realize that her song will go nowhere and make no money, right?  We didn't even, we, again, not being, trying to be unkind, but we also felt that the recording that she sent us wasn't that professional. 
[00:28:00]  And it's probably being taken by them.  Again, it's not our place to tell people that they're no good or good.  We're not American Idol.  We just wanted to help her out if we could.  We can't help you out and do that if you won't validate the fact that you're doing it in the first place.  You just sign an agreement.  How many franchises do you actually have?  Well, we have Louisa Holman, and she's, you know, she started like eight years ago or something like that. 
[00:28:30]  She tried to trademark the name Naked Cowgirl, and they said she couldn't.  The World Trade Patent Office, whatever, World Patent and Trade Office said that she couldn't because it was too similar to Naked Cowboy.  Anyway, so she did sign into the agreement.  We had a guy in Denver, Colorado, go to a Denver Broncos game for his first appearance, and he called me and asked me,  what do I do when somebody kicks me in the ass?  And that was his last day working, so I think that's kind of.  So the franchise business has not taken off there, sir? 
[00:29:00]  No, not the franchise.  Well, again, we're talking about a franchise, but we're also just talking about licensing.  We have Naked Cowboy Tequila.  We have Naked Cowboy Oysters.  We have Naked Cowboy Protein.  Go for you.  Naked Cowboy.  The licensing of it has been phenomenal.  This is just the actual, you know, someone getting in their underwear and doing it.  So I was under the impression that you and the Naked Cowgirl were married.  Like, that seems to be what everybody thinks.  Either that, or she's my mother, or she's my grandmother.  I hear everything.  You would never marry her to a Naked Cowgirl? 
[00:29:30]  Not Sandy, but wasn't there another woman you used to play with?  Yeah, wasn't she your girlfriend at one time or something?  I've had a couple of girlfriends along the way who got in a Naked Cowgirl outfit to promote or to do something.  So you were basically trying to be...  I've been on court shows, a couple of courtroom shows where I was judged.  I don't know, it was one of my girlfriends who was saying that it was unethical or something.  And she lost that case in a courtroom.  And then my other girlfriend on Christina's court was trying to take my webcam because she didn't want the webcam in the bedroom while we were sleeping. 
[00:30:00]  But it was a 24-hour day webcam.  I couldn't let down the audience.  Sir, you were trying to kind of let Sandy fly under the radar because you kind of felt like,  ah, she's just a harmless old lady trying to make her rent.  But after she began to flaunt it and try to take it national with an album that you're not on, you had enough.  Well, again, even with all that, I was still saying, I'm still willing to be the one on the album, record it for her, 
[00:30:30]  and just, again, make the whole thing legitimate by signing a franchise agreement  and having my manager who watches over my affairs also make sure that everything's being done legit from her end.  And she decided not to go through with those things.  And then we just sent a cease and desist saying, look, if you're not going to do it by the rules, you just have to stop.  That's all.  Well, where is this going to lead to?  Well, she's going to stop, I guess, on July 1st because at this point we have to cease and desist saying that. 
[00:31:00]  What if she doesn't?  Well, I guess if she doesn't, then she's saying, please, please sue me, and we will have no choice but to sue her pants on.  What do you think you'll actually get from her, though, since she is pretty destitute?  Well, again, it's not about trying to get something from her.  It's just trying to...  No, I understand.  Do you honestly think there's a way to stop her short of somehow having her arrested? 
[00:31:30]  I don't think a civil court case would actually bear any fruit, as they say.  She's kind of kooky, and she's going to do what she wants, you know?  That may be the case.  Again, I don't know.  Again, I'm not pushing this thing.  We're just simply trying to...  We know what we have to do to protect the brand.  If she's going to continue to afford, I guess she's basically...  Again, she's at the helm of this thing, not myself.  And I think, again, she's acting just like a naked cowboy would. 
[00:32:00]  It's like doing everything she can to get as much meaty as she can and smoking it for all it's worth.  I mean...  That's true.  Just stop her.  Have you ever thought about holding up a mirror in front of her and just making her look at herself in that outfit?  There's no hard feelings about the whole thing.  Oh, my God.  How about a laugh?  She is a disaster.  You take yourself too seriously, sir.  This is all fun.  I mean, all this publicity that she's getting just gave you a shitload of publicity as well.  Well, again, I find everything serves me. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, that's true.  We've seen you on the news a few times.  This has to, you know, be kind of good.  You're really unlikable.  It's got to be pretty good, you know, getting a few people, getting your face out there on the news.  What would you like to see happen in way of a resolution?  Either someone coming to the forefront and helping her out, helping her pay a small licensing fee and let her move forward and continue to assist her, or that she'll stop on June 2nd or June 1st. 
[00:33:00]  July.  And if I guess she keeps coming out, I don't know.  I think that it's just because of the situation she's put it in, I guess we would have to go forward just as a matter of process.  But, again, I don't know.  Just beat her up.  Send out some leg breakers to just bust her legs.  We'd be willing to chip in if you wanted to just have her guitar broken over her head.  That was another joke.  All right, Mr. Naked Cowboy. 
[00:33:30]  I came up and I was on your show years and years ago.  Yeah, we remember that.  It was gone, and how is, I mean, where are you guys now?  Oh, my God.  A lot of people ask that.  That's wonderful that you said that.  We're on Sirius XM.  We're on the 49th and 6th, the satellite radio building.  You've been in the building before.  We've actually seen you.  Yeah.  I've been there several times, actually.  Yeah, and I didn't know where you were.  Good, Sirius.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  All right, well, good luck in the litigation.  We hope it works out.  Would you be willing, let me say, Cassandy Cain's people are notoriously difficult. 
[00:34:00]  We've all had to deal with them.  Do you have people?  Yeah, well, I guess she does.  I mean, is she doing her own legal wrangling?  Yeah, she's a lawyer.  Would you be willing to negotiate with her, let's say?  Again, since the very beginning, the whole thing, it's just been a matter of just signing  a piece of paper that says you're not going to show pictures of your jettles and all kinds  of outlandish things like that.  I just keep it under the, you know, it's kind of hard to say, hey, quit acting like a crazy 
[00:34:30]  person when you're the naked cowboy, but at the same time.  You don't want the brand embarrassed.  I mean, we just want to keep it as classy, once again, ironically, as classy as possible.  Well, you do realize she has a genital wart the size of an ear, right?  I add, that's the thing I heard about.  Yeah, you've heard about it.  Yeah, it's quite disturbing.  Don't touch her.  She swears it's a shaving accident, but we've had doctors look at it, and it's very contagious. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, not very good for the naked cowboy image.  A genital-warded naked cowgirl.  I think Santa Cain could put a little cowboy hat on Twato and go to Times Square and make  some money off Twato.  She should have a different gimmick, like the naked Frankenstein.  I'd never seen it, but my manager talked about something called, I think you said Twato.  Twato, yes.  It was indeed Twato.  Nicknamed it years ago.  Yeah. 
[00:35:30]  Well, good luck to you there, naked cowboy.  Good hearing your side of this.  Thanks for having me.  All right, we'll be back in touch as the case progresses, unless Sandy Cain's legal team  decides to try to acquiesce to your wishes.  Jacobian, ugh.  That was another joke.  All right, Mr. Cowboy.  Have a great one.  Thanks for calling.  All right, take care, man.  Good luck.  Naked cowboy, everyone.  Where does he keep his cell phone, you think? 
[00:36:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Up his asshole, right?  Do you think?  Very unlikable.  You think so?  Yeah, he's beating up an old lady.  I think he was trying to not pursue it.  I think she really, really held it in his face, like this is what...  I think he saw her for years and was like, what are you going to do?  He's fucking half dead.  He's a phony.  He's loving that he's all over the news because of Sandy Cain.  He's all over the publicity.  Because of Sandy Cain, he's all over the news.  He's loving it.  So at that point, he should just leave her the fuck alone.  But I think he's got to set a precedent, you know?  It's got to be like... 
[00:36:30]  Why?  Because everyone's just clamoring to be the next naked something?  Who knows?  He has one lousy franchise guy that got kicked in the ass at a Broncos game and quit.  This thing is not taking off like McDonald's.  We should have asked.  I forgot two M&M's.  They had like some naked cowboy...  All right.  M&M, and he went after them, too.  He was right where he works.  He did win.  Yeah.  What's this, Danny?  I don't know.  Derek just kind of plopped it in front of me.  Oh.  Oh, I think it's the stinger for the Sandy Gate.  Oh. 
[00:37:00]  It's Sandy Gate 2010.  Oh, no, no, really?  All right.  That works.  Oh, no, no, really?  Where were we with Sam talking to all the naked people?  We played Sandy's clip or no?  The first track, I think.  That was it?  And then you have Sandy Cain's accusations here.  Right.  Then she starts talking about the naked cowgirl.  So, Sandy, you're all over the news now.  Right.  Apparently, the naked cowboy...  Oh, this is the...  Okay, Walter Cronkite thing.  We played this clip, right? 
[00:37:30]  Right.  Okay, so let's...  All right.  All right.  I got you.  You guys should be the first people to side with me.  Even Steve today.  You're...  I have every lawyer in the world telling me he doesn't have a case.  All kinds of people saying he doesn't have a fucking case.  And my friends, people I have sacrificed for, showed up early in the morning, spent money on,  10 fucking years.  Yeah.  And they're going against me.  You should be the first people to put your arms around me and say,  Sam, we're 100% with you. 
[00:38:00]  I ripped off no one.  I was...  I've been naked for years.  I've been naked since I'm 20 years old.  I'm on your side.  Okay, thank you.  I am.  I don't even like this other naked cowgirl here.  I think she needs to hit the bricks.  Hit the pricks?  Hit the bricks.  Uh-oh.  Hit the pricks.  That was your...  Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's hitting the bricks.  Oh, is that right?  Yeah, yeah.  They say she's a cool girl, but she's supposed to be going to school.  But you think she's more like...  She's implicating her.  Did she say she looks like a cool girl?  No, they said she's... 
[00:38:30]  They say she's a cool girl.  They say she's a cool girl.  She says she's going to school.  They're both going to be in here at the same time.  Oh, Jesus.  I have a clip coming up that no other news network got yesterday.  Oh, shit.  I had Sandy Cain talking to the other naked cowgirl.  Wow.  I did that.  We're going to school.  But you think she's more likely...  I have no idea, really.  But what do they say?  They say she left Times Square to do porno movies out in L.A.  And that she sucked the cowboy's cock in the garage in his car. 
[00:39:00]  The naked cowboy.  Yeah.  And that's maybe how she got the license.  Maybe she just blew him in the car.  Yeah, maybe that's it.  But no, it's all bullshit because she does not have the license.  Why don't we ask her?  Do you have a license?  I will.  I'll ask her.  Let's ask her together.  Together?  Okay, let's go talk to her.  Oh, my God.  She certainly is making some allegations that are amazing.  Eric, she's stuck his cock in the garage.  Eric, she's stuck his cock in the garage. 
[00:39:30]  What other news network has this?  Wow, is that good.  That's a biggie.  What's happening there?  They're arresting the cowgirl.  She's got her pasties on.  Is that her?  The cop has it by the wrist.  Maybe the pasties weren't good enough or something.  They felt like her tits were showing too much.  Or maybe she was blowing the naked cowboy in the garage.  In the garage as per Sandy Cain.  Sam got Sandy Cain to talk to the real naked cowgirl. 
[00:40:00]  Wow.  That's right.  Hi, other cowgirl.  Hi, how are you?  Good, how are you?  Good.  Sandy, we just wanted to ask you some questions.  Yeah, okay.  To be honest, there's been some rumors going around about you.  Before I even met you, there was a guy that's merely in love with you.  He's a short guy and he wears like a black leather jacket.  He said you went out to L.A. to make porno movies.  Oh, no, no.  That's Victor.  And he is, I think he has schizophrenia.  He's a little bit delusional, but I love his guts.  I mean, he's super nice and he's always giving me tips in Times Square. 
[00:40:30]  Seems like a liar.  Okay.  Well, he's the liar.  Right.  And that you were crazy about the naked cowboy and that you gave him a blowjob in the garage in his car.  Again, another rumor.  The cowboy has a girlfriend.  I know.  But they've been together forever.  So, yeah.  Yeah.  She fucking rules.  Oh, my God.  Some schizophrenic guy going up to her and telling all these she rules.  Sandy is amazing. 
[00:41:00]  She is.  Sandy is not a liar, though.  Like, even I think if she says wrong things, she believes him.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, of course.  It's wonderful.  I gave him a blowjob in the garage.  But she'll just ask the person.  Yeah, yeah.  There's no back fucking behind backstabbing shit with her.  No.  It's all up front.  I heard she sucked his dick in the garage.  Holy shit.  I heard.  Here's what the rumors are.  I see them smiling.  Are they going to the Sandy Cain segment?  Oh, listen, friends.  Tell a family member.  Give us some more viewers.  That's what we're here for. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, and let us know what you like, actually.  We're going to be reading the emails.  Of course it actually talks.  You can send them to us.  Morningnews at WPN.  Okay, so this must be really new.  Yeah, they...  We'll take any information.  Get in touch with us and spread the love.  How's that?  Sounds good.  All right, we've got a lot coming up.  The Naked Cowgirl is here live.  We're going to tell you about the Naked Cowgirl.  We've got some B-rolls in.  She looks horrendous.  We're going to talk to her next.  There she is right now.  They're playing Elton John over her. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, my God.  She is a fucking disaster.  She's not...  By the way, she won't leave in July.  Of course she won't.  And you can hear the Naked Cowboy.  He's frustrated.  There's nothing he can do.  There's nothing he can do.  There's nothing he can do.  They could chalk up billions of dollars where they would fine her.  But, I mean, she's not going to pay it.  She's not going to pay it.  She's just not going to keep going out there.  And he wants...  Dude, the Naked Cowboy wants no part of suing her. 
[00:42:30]  He just wants her to shut up and do a dumb thing.  It happened.  Until she pushed it and said he was on an album.  Yeah.  He had to serve.  For a dumb song that's on a cassette.  Like, he thinks that it's going to sell.  I told Sandy to bring the song.  Oh, nice.  In question.  Oh, good.  Wow.  We should hear it.  Yeah.  All the exclusives.  The Opie and Anthony show.  This is truly your Sandy Gate connection.  This is Sandy Gate headquarters.  Sandy Gate headquarters.  That's the cue for the Sandy Gate town. 
[00:43:00]  It's Sandy Gate 2010.  Oh, no, no, really?  Fuck the oil wealth.  This is great.  This is more of a disaster.  You guys said you wanted another story.  This is the story.  This is the disaster.  She just became really famous.  She made another drudge.  In the last 24 hours.  In the last 24 hours.  In post.  I couldn't believe where the story was yesterday.  It was everywhere.  Yep.  And it continues today.  It's so beautiful that this had to happen on a slow news day. 
[00:43:30]  And Sandy Gate is becoming a national star.  National story, man.  This is big.  I would say international.  Yes, I'm sure.  International sensation.  I'm sure they're talking about it in between calls of the soccer game there in South Africa.  All right.  Here we go.  This might be it.  Oh, yeah?  Hey.  Oh, I saw a logo.  No?  Okay.  Toy Story 3.  That movie's huge.  Of course it's huge.  Huge.  God, it's amazing. 
[00:44:00]  When you saw the first one, you thought it looked really good as far as the animation goes.  You know, it's just ridiculous.  3D IMAX.  Fuck.  I got to go see that shit.  3D.  Danny was commenting on the 3D television last night.  You saw it?  Yeah.  They had one set up in the Sony Style store.  And I was taking a look at it.  It's kind of interesting, I guess.  But I don't know.  I thought I'd be a little more like blown away by the whole phenomenon.  And I just kind of looked at it and was like, meh.  It's just the beginning, I'm thinking, you know?  I mean, plus like the glasses, like the Sony glasses, like they take batteries. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  How big are they?  Is there a plug attached?  Is there wire?  No, there's no wire, I guess.  I think it takes like a little watch battery or something.  But like they didn't feel good.  Like on your head, they were kind of like awkward and heavy.  Did the fact that the TV bother you?  Like, because usually a movie screen is what you're watching 3D on.  And did the TV fuck you up because it's like a small, where you could see everything around it?  Yeah.  No, it was fine.  It was just like, I was kind of expecting to see some kind of like three dimensions of a person.  Like if I was looking at a human on television, I would expect to see like roundness of the face and round contours. 
[00:45:00]  And all I really saw was like different layers of flatness, you know?  So it's flatness that was almost layered like a view master or something.  I don't know.  I mean, the rubes that were staring at it, like they were all impressed with it.  Yeah, and I just kind of looked at it and I was like, I don't know.  This is amazing.  I mean, they had like some golf demo on and like, you know, it was whatever.  Some of the gaming looked okay.  Like I think they were showing like Wipeout, which is like some driving game in 3D.  That looked pretty cool.  I'll wait for the next generation. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, I'm not buying the first one.  I'm not buying the first one.  Not that I can't afford it.  Well, there's nothing that was surprising too.  I thought it was going to be like, you know, like 12 grand for the thing because it's brand new.  But the one I was looking at, it wasn't that much.  It was like, I think it was barely scraping three.  In Times Square, city's famous naked cowboy.  Sorry, I had to jump in.  We're live on Childish.  Sandy Gate.  The naked cowgirl.  We're watching.  The naked cowgirl joins us live with her side of the story this morning.  Welcome to the show.  Oh, thank you so much.  Can we make a deal?  Can we make an agreement, a handshake deal?  Sure.  I understand that yesterday for the first time you went topless in Times Square. 
[00:46:00]  Can we make a deal you'll keep the top on?  No, no, no.  Promise?  No, I'll tell you, it was really an exciting thing for me because.  Well, there was quite a breeze yesterday, so it was probably stimulating.  No, no, it was warm and hot and sticky and shdicky.  Yeah, yeah.  And there are, yes.  The naked cowboy, the reason I'm trying to push you out of Times Square and get rid of  you, and in their legal argument that I have read, quite in detail, it says that you are  essentially a copy of him, a rip-off. 
[00:46:30]  Could you stand up and give me a little 360, and we're going to bring up a double box to compare  you and the naked cowboy?  I think I have.  How similar?  Give me a 360.  I want to see the whole body.  I have different things, you know?  I mean.  Come on, say Tess.  Now, that's the other naked cowgirl that's there, and then there's the naked cowboy,  and you do look different than, well, you definitely look different than him.  Yes.  Definitely.  So this is a different act.  But I went topless yesterday, so it was more like him than ever. 
[00:47:00]  So it was a bigger lawsuit now that it's topless.  You're making me nervous being this close.  You can take a seat.  It's okay.  Okay.  It's okay.  Oh, hey, oh, hey, hey, hey.  She's showing her ass.  She's showing her ass.  Can they do this?  I mean, it's Times Square.  Can they kick you out of Times Square?  You know, only God can kick you out of Times Square, and the cops can kick you out of Times Square.  I hear the cops like you.  They loved it.  You know, I was like, wow.  There's only in Times Square that I can do this, and I think that it was a very natural thing for me to do it. 
[00:47:30]  And years ago, when I became a topless dancer, see, I worked.  He's trying to kick me out, but I worked in every strip club along Flash Dancers.  Didn't you used to, I understand, you used to light your breasts on fire?  Yes, I still do, Chris.  Really?  I just did it in Austria.  Yeah, I have inverted, inverted.  Yeah.  Okay, can you say it?  Yeah, yeah.  Inverted nipples, so I stick wooden matches in there, and then I light them up. 
[00:48:00]  So it's very exciting.  It's so good for birthdays, but it's because...  Very good.  This is a game of a comedy show on public access.  Then I used to play songs like, come on, baby, light your fire.  Can you play a little of that for me?  I'd like to...  I'm just going to visualize what it'd be like.  The whole guitar.  Listen to a guitar.  That's the one I broke.  Come on, baby, light my fire.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, in Times Square, you're my only desire.  Really? 
[00:48:30]  Me?  Say cock.  Definitely.  Why not?  Hot man in the house.  What do they want you to pay to stay in Times Square, entertaining folks?  They want you to come up with some money.  How much?  $5,000, and the other naked cowgirl they don't want anything from.  Uh-oh.  Because I asked her.  Oh, well.  She said, it's a confidentiality.  I can't say anything.  But they're going against me and not against him, her.  And that is really what bothers me.  I mean, first of all, she's the original naked cowgirl. 
[00:49:00]  If they're going against me, well, how come they're not going against her?  John Tampson?  Linda, what do you think about this?  Is there enough room in Times Square for a naked cowgirl, ex-stripper, a younger naked  cowgirl, and a naked cowboy?  Is there enough room?  It's Times Square.  It's a big place.  It's a big place.  You got it.  Crying out loud.  You want to do a little weather real quick?  Oh, no.  Absolutely.  I mean, don't you think that that is very, like, what's going on?  I mean, the naked cowboy's going through, he's hit 40 years old.  Yeah.  He's going through a crisis.  He's got to reinvent himself. 
[00:49:30]  Can I ask you to play a little music while Linda does the weather, kind of a musical  accompaniment, if you don't mind?  You know, and that is really what...  Give me a little...  Give me a little...  Thank you very much.  I appreciate anything hot.  Do you know any hot songs?  Oh, no.  Hot time, summer in the city, that kind of thing.  72 degrees outside right now.  Fuzzy cameras.  Excessive heat warning.  Yeah, they're using fuzzy cameras on it right now.  I cannot impress this upon you enough.  It is so hot out there today.  What a disaster that was.  You wouldn't be surprised if we have problems, you know, with the electricity, you know,  how it is in New York when this happens. 
[00:50:00]  Everybody tries to crank up the air conditioners.  There can be problems with that.  Everybody.  Sandy, she is great on television.  She's about that.  She's great in every area of the media.  Only God can get you out of time to go...  And the cops.  Please be careful out there.  Hazy.  Doing a dumb weather report.  When you have Sandy in the studio, really?  They should spend the hour with her.  Blow off the weather and just continue with her.  They have to say goodbye to her.  The afternoon is when we really start to heat up. 
[00:50:30]  We're up around...  It's going to be a hot one here in New York City.  And maybe 89 degrees towards the evening hours.  91.  We'd actually be lucky in the evening hours if we get a couple of thunderstorms.  So that would actually be...  Pool day today.  ...show up right over my tomatoes.  You got it.  News at 7.  Speaking of tomatoes.  Good morning.  I'm John Malerka.  That's it.  I guarantee you the news director walked in and said,  Get that thing out of the studio.  We're trying to be legit.  There's a thing in the studio. 
[00:51:00]  Like my five inverted nipples.  I wouldn't imagine them.  Wooden matches in a...  She said that on the news.  But very serious, as a matter of fact.  Oh, God.  Like she was a head of state, you know.  She was just very serious.  Oh, my God.  I wish the news guy was more serious with her, like instead of being jokey,  because that would have made it more interesting if he was like being a real news guy.  Of course.  Travis has the quote.  Travis, hit it, man.  Can they do this?  I mean, it's Times Square.  Can they kick you out of Times Square? 
[00:51:30]  You know, only God can kick you out of Times Square.  And the cops.  And the cops.  She's very profound.  She's just the greatest.  Yesterday, she told me that I inspired her to remove her top.  Wow, really?  Well, look at you, Sam.  Something tells me it doesn't take much inspiration for her to take her fucking clothes off.  Where's she going to be next?  Well, apparently she might be on GMA.  That's what she told Steve yesterday.  But she probably also is just going to stand outside the window like a buffoon. 
[00:52:00]  Do you think she would do that, like a boob?  Yeah, I think she would.  It would be great.  She's going to be in here at 8 o'clock?  That's when she was booked yesterday, yes.  All right.  So.  All right.  And we did notice that Linda Church, they put the camera on her, and it's Vaseline cam.  Wow.  She does not like that HD.  And wow, they smear that camera.  Yeah.  It looks like a haze is on the map behind her.  It's just a fucking.  Yeah.  I'm an old lady cam.  An old lady cam. 
[00:52:30]  Diane Sawyer uses that.  Yeah, yeah.  A lot of them didn't like when they went to high def, because it shows everything.  Wow.  All right.  Good speed.  That was hysterical, man.  God damn Sandy.  She's the greatest.  Just throwing her.  Yeah.  That was fucking.  Sandy Kane and intern David had some kind of controversy, because intern David is another  person.  He could be a national figure, I think.  How good would he be on the news?  He'd be so great.  Did I tell you my intern David story?  It's really quick. 
[00:53:00]  Intern David?  A couple weeks ago, when Patrice was in, we went and got something to eat.  Did I tell this on the air?  You told me.  I don't know who he was on the air.  Oh, okay.  I think so.  We're at a place where we're right on the street, basically.  Intern David walks by in a really nice suit, sees me, panics, and runs away.  Why?  I don't know.  Did he tell you that he was interviewing for something?  He didn't tell me, but I got a phone call.  I guess he put me as his recommendation, because I got a phone call.  He saw me, panicked, and just turned and ran. 
[00:53:30]  I think he's applying to work at the Intrepid Museum or something.  Really?  I can't believe we don't have him.  We need an intern update from him.  Okay.  I'll book him.  What would he know about the Intrepid Museum?  I don't know.  We'll find out.  Do you think he'd be good on the news, though?  How good would he be?  Well, no.  He'd be a fantastic guy.  This is an airplane.  They'd ask him a question, and he'd give that sort of cross-eyed stare that he gives, where  he just stares back at you for a while.  He had no idea what's going on. 
[00:54:00]  He'd be going for, like, a pat on the shoulder to say, good job on the interview, and he'd start  twitching.  He's just twitching.  He'd twitch.  His thumb twitch.  Whenever you're patted him on the back of the shoulder, he'd twitch.  You'd make that face.  I want him to be my spokesman.  Oh, he's fantastic.  Well, we should take our first break.  We got a Sandy Cain song we can play until break.  What do you want to play, Travis?  You got something good.  I got something good.  I have Gloria or Tits My Party.  I like Tits My Party.  All right, let's play Tits My Party from Sandy Cain, and we'll continue. 
[00:54:30]  Stay there.  It's my party, and I'll fart if I want to, fart if I want to, fart if I want to.  You would fart, too, if you were a Jew.  I just came from Taco Bell.  I had a bean taco or two.  And it's my party party, and I'm going to fart for you, of course. 
[00:55:00]  It's my party, and I'll fart if I want to, fart if I want to, fart if I want to.  You would fart, too, at a party party, ooh.  I just ate some Kasha Bonitz's with some Kasha Bonitz's with some Krabla soup and ooh.  I ate some stuffed cabbage and some Gefilte fish, too, and ooh.  It's my party, and I'll fart if I want to, fart if I want to, fart if I want to. 
[00:55:30]  You would fart, too, you would fart, too, if you were a Jew.  Everybody, fart, fart, fart, fart, fart.  I just ate some broccoli with some Kasha Bonitz's with some Kasha Bonitz's with some Kasha Bonitz's. 
[00:56:00]  I ate some Brussels sprouts and I'm going to fart over you  Cause it's my party and I'm fart if I want to  Fart if I want to  Fart if I want to  You would fart too and I'm farting for you  Yeah, yeah, yeah  It's my party and I'm fart if I want to 
[00:56:30]  I'm fart if I want to  I'm fart if I want to  You would fart too if you were a Jew  Yeah, it's my party and I'm fart if I want to  I'm fart if I want to  I'm fart if I want to  You would fart too if you were a Jew  We want to hear what's inside your little brain  Call 866-866-WOW-1-WOW 
[00:57:00]  That's 866-969-1969  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show  On the fire and the Sirius XM  Yeah  Yeah  Sirius XM  So we got Sandy Kane coming in at 8 o'clock within the hour  Also, Patrice O'Neill stopping by  He's got a big comedy show at Helium Comedy Club in Philly  Stopping by to say hi  Yeah, a lot of people want to talk about McChrystal  General McChrystal  Yes 
[00:57:30]  We have a guy that's been on hold for an hour and ten minutes  My God  Is it the general?  I think it is the general  Let's see  Chris, Long Island  You just waited an hour  Hour and ten minutes  I did, I did  I'm happy that I got on with you guys  Hi  Well, so are we  What do you got, sir?  But, um  I'm just wondering  Because  Anthony is kind of one of those guys  That I'm best friends with  On the Stormfront.org  Stormfront  And the  And Mania  I don't think I  Belong to either site, sir 
[00:58:00]  Oh, no  Anthony  Come on  I know your  AKAs  I know your aliases  Do you honestly think I would  Go on a white supremacist website  And register my name?  Not your name  But your aliases  Do you think I would use  My home computer  And an IP address  And actually  Join those sites?  Or I would read them 
[00:58:30]  I'd go on and read the sites  Do I think  Or do I know?  What's your point, sir?  Yeah, what is your point?  What are you getting at, Chris?  What are you getting at?  My point is  That right now  We're going into  A meeting  Tonight  With  Or today  With  The president of the United States  And he's about to get rid of a general  Over a Rolling Stone article  Is that not  A little bit  Outstanding?  Ridiculous?  I will say this 
[00:59:00]  I haven't read the whole article  From what I've read  And my first instinct was  What a dope Obama is  But I'm reading this article  And the general and his staff  Were stupid  Should have kept their yaps shut  You really  You can't  The general and his staff  Knew a Rolling Stone reporter  Was there  It wasn't like it was a quote given  Right  They were interacting  Around this  This  Reporter  And some of these quotes  I'm like  What the fuck  Is this guy doing?  Like they  They were kind of 
[00:59:30]  Joking around  About McAllister  Going to make a speech  And they were saying  McAllister  What's that?  McAllister  McChrystal  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  I'm keeping it  McAllister  And one of them said  Who's he going to dinner  Oh yeah  Who's he going to dinner with?  I asked one of his aides  Some French minister  The aide tells me  It's fucking gay  And it's like  Again  Not about it being  Anti-gay  Or homosexual  But it's like  You're speaking  For the guy  Who's running the war  In Iraq  In Afghanistan 
[01:00:00]  What are you doing?  Yeah maybe you shouldn't  Blurt that out  It was really stupid  Stuff like that  Like if they disagree  With the president  That's fine  They should be able  To say it  Let me see  I'm trying to find  Little quotes in here  That are not  Going to cause me  To read a whole  Oh yeah  One of them was saying  Now flipping through  Print out cards  Of his speech in Paris  McAllister  On the crystal  I keep saying McAllister  Wonders aloud  What Biden question  He might get today  And how he should respond  I never know 
[01:00:30]  It's going to pop out  Until I'm up there  That's the problem  He says  Then unable  To help themselves  He and his staff  Imagine the general  Dismissing the vice president  With a good one liner  You're talking about  Vice President Biden  McChrystal says  With a laugh  Who's that?  Biden suggests  The top advisor  Did you say  Bite me?  And it's like  Again  Not that those are  Assassination jokes  But they're stupid  Things to say  In a Rolling Stone article  And that's just  On page two  Of the article  Yeah you probably  Shouldn't say stuff 
[01:01:00]  Like that  If you're in a position  Where you're supposed  To be the head  Muckety-muck  Although these are  Just you know  Soldiers  And they're talking  Like soldiers  But the Rolling Stone  Guy  Probably did  Play the Mr. Friendly  Guy to him  Yeah  All chuckles  And trying to get  A little bit out  Of him  And did  And now the guy's  Fired  Fired  So fired  He's got to fly  Halfway around the world  To sit in front  Of his boss  And get fired  They said that 
[01:01:30]  He went the first time  And McChrystal  Talks about  The first meeting  He had with Obama  And they said  That they kind of  Didn't get along  From the outset  And they said  He first encountered  Obama a week  After he took office  And the president  Had met with  I guess 12  Senior military officials  In a room  In the Pentagon  Or the tank  And they say  According to sources  Familiar with the meeting  McChrystal thought  Obama looked uncomfortable  And intimidated  By the room full  Of military brass  And it's like  All this stuff  Really makes the president 
[01:02:00]  Look like an asshole  And you can't do that  When you're the fucking guy  Running the war  In Afghanistan  Yeah the president  Could do that all by himself  Yeah  He doesn't need the general  To say those things  Do you know what I mean man  There was a lot of stupid  When it's a complete  Like realization  Of the person  Talking about it  I think that I  Can actually  Believe  In those words  I mean  It's not something  That you'd like to hear  From a general  But it is something  That has to take stock  But if you believe  In him or not  Protocol says 
[01:02:30]  You just don't say  Those things  About your boss  Believe me  I agree with him  I bet  When Obama  Sat down in there  Yes  This liberal  New president  Just sitting there  In front of a bunch  Of military men  He probably was  Intimidated  And looked uncomfortable  Whether he should  Say it or not  He's going to get  Your ass fired  He didn't come up  In the  He hasn't been  In politics  Like George Bush  Was  Like with his father  Being  Bush Jr.  Probably was not  Intimidated in that room 
[01:03:00]  Because he was  You know  He's been involved  I totally disagree  Anthony  And I really  Respect your opinion  But what I'm saying  Is that  When it comes  To George Bush  I mean  That was me  That said it  Yeah that was Jimmy  He comes out of nowhere  He  I understand  What your point is  But he was still  Somebody who  Hasn't had that seat  And nobody has  Had that seat  Until they get there  And Obama's position  Is going to be  The exact same place  Where George Bush  Was on 9-11  What do you  I don't know  What you mean 
[01:03:30]  Yeah why  Yeah Chris  You're not being  Clear  You gotta summarize  What do you think  Obama should do  With this situation  Obviously Obama's  In a very bad spot  Right now  And it's obvious  He's going to force  McChrystal to resign  Today probably  Probably within  The next few hours  Is that the right move  That's what I'm asking you  You're the one  That called  With an opinion  You called  So I'm like  What do you think  Obama should do  Because it seems like  Obama's in a bad position  I don't think  That a Rolling Stone article  Is the proper protocol 
[01:04:00]  To force a general  To resign  From a major operation  Like Afghanistan  But let me ask you  I do tend to agree  With that  But it wasn't  Just an article  Where he was quoted  Once or overheard  They were  The reporter  Was with them  Like they were  Very well aware  That they were  With a reporter  And they were saying  You know something though  Is this a move  That makes Obama  That  Is firing him  A move  Hold on 
[01:04:30]  Hold on  Hold on  Two seconds  Is firing Obama  Or firing  Is Obama firing  The general  A move that is  In the best interest  Of the war  Or in the best interest  Of Obama  Not looking silly  By not firing him  Now the bottom line  Is you want  A general  That knows what he's doing  Familiar with the theater  And knows exactly  What should be done  And getting a new guy  In there now  Is probably not  The best thing  So is he saving face 
[01:05:00]  By doing this  And  We're all in agreement  That it's a political move  Absolutely  If he fires him yet  And I'm not saying  He should be fired  Which happens all the time  It's going to happen though  It's going to happen today  Oh yeah  He's so fired  He might be  He's not  He's going to resign  He's going to remove  He's going to save face  And he's going to resign  Yeah he doesn't want to resign  But that's what he's going to do  To save face  It's going to happen  Yeah I don't think  That a Rolling Stone article  Should force the resignation  Of a guy qualified  But he was stupid  He was stupid  I wanted to bring up today  But he was stupid dude  You have to acknowledge that  Alright Chris  Thank you  I'm going to move on  To Dave in North Carolina 
[01:05:30]  Dave what's up  Hey boys  Hey  Hey I don't think  That McChrystal  Was stupid at all  I think that he knew  Exactly what he was doing  On this  You don't  Get where he's been  Has gotten to  By being an idiot  And I feel like  That he probably said  Hey guys  Let's say this stuff  About Biden  Holbrook  All these guys  And it's obvious  And now you're getting  All the back story  On this stuff  That they all hate each other  Well 
[01:06:00]  Duh  Why do you think  That he sat in front  Of a Rolling Stone reporter  A guy that you know  Is going to give  Everything negative  About the war effort  Is the perfect guy  To use to get this shit out  In a way yes  But I think there's  A smarter way  To get the information out  Like the leak  About needing  40,000 troops  Yeah  Really annoyed Obama  But he had to react to it  And it was a smart leak  That was not  That was a smart leak  That helped the effort  And what he wanted  To me this just seems like  It was just 
[01:06:30]  It was just  He's a smart guy  But he's a brash guy  The general  And he's like  He's like a fucking  Blue collar dude  He doesn't like fancy places  He likes just to go out  And have a beer  And I think he was  Probably too comfortable  Around this reporter  And said things he shouldn't  Well it's a Rolling Stone reporter  I kind of like Dave's point  Right here  You know you gotta assume  Rolling Stone's gonna go  Holy shit  We got something good  Right here  Stop the fucking presses  So dude you think  Go ahead  I'm sorry buddy  You think he wanted himself  To have to resign  And end his military career  Like this  Absolutely 
[01:07:00]  I think that he  And I don't think  This is about  Oh okay  I think this is about  The deadline  McChrystal wants  To stay there  Indefinitely  And I don't know  If I agree with that  I think it's  You know those people  Have been doing this shit  For thousands of years  And we're thinking  We're gonna solve it  In 18 months  I think it's more  About the deadline  Than anything  And this is his way  Of maybe getting out  And because he thinks  Well if I've got Obama  As president  And this guy 
[01:07:30]  Doesn't believe in the effort  He never believed it  When he was a senator  He did nothing  But bitch about the troops  And talk about how  Big of a waste of time  This was  And now he's got  As president  The guy that's  His commander in chief  As the guy  That he's got  An answer to  How would you  It would be like  You guys  You know  Having an intern  Running your radio station  Right  You know  You'd sit there  And you go  What the fuck do you know  We did  We did over at CBS  Yeah  It was a former intern  Running a radio station 
[01:08:00]  Well  You're right though  And I guarantee you  That's how he looks at it  And he saw this  Rolling Stone guy  And McChrystal  I don't care  If he's fresh  If he's got  These guys  Don't let their guard down  This guy was a  Black ops guy  For 20 years  These guys  Don't do that  I mean  He knew exactly  What he was doing  I like your point  Dave a lot  I really do  Good speculation  What's that boys  Alright man  Let's say hi to  I don't know 
[01:08:30]  I just messed up  Whatever  Mike in Jersey  Make it good  Mike  Yeah I mean  Do you guys know  That this is  McChrystal  It's not the first time  That he's really  Really fucked up  Do you remember  Pat Tillman  Sure  Yeah  He was involved  He was the guy  Who put the whole  Cover up together  Around his death  Remember after he died  They said  Yeah he died  Fighting valiantly  Right  He was actually killed  By friendly fire  Yes  It was McChrystal  That signed the reports  For his  I think he was going to get  A silver star  For death  By an enemy combat  When he was actually killed 
[01:09:00]  When he was actually killed  By friendly fire  And McChrystal  He's a guy  He's got like  This laser like  Attention to detail  And he says  Oh I didn't read  Through the report  Where it said  You know  Where it said  How he was killed  When he was actually killed  By friendly fire  He you know  He is the type of guy  Who will do  Whatever it takes  To get the job done  That his boss says  And then it was  Who told us  The guy  Rumsfeld  Donald Rumsfeld  Yes  He said that  You know  This is a story  We can't say that  Tillman was killed  By friendly fire  It's got to be 
[01:09:30]  A hero type thing  McChrystal did his job  What he was supposed to do  So what do you  Are you saying  That McChrystal was smart here  Or let his guard down here  Or I'm not sure  What you're saying  I'm saying that  This is what McChrystal does  Is he fucks around  He breaks the rules  He bends the rules  To do whatever the hell  It is that he needs to do  He has this group  Of guys around him  That they have this culture of  We don't play by the rules  We do what the fuck  We want to do  To get the job done  We think is right  And every once in a while  It blows up in his face  He's been able to skate it  A couple times  I don't think he's going to 
[01:10:00]  Be able to skate this time  Right  Because I think that leak  They said that leak  Really pissed Obama off  About needing 40,000  That he was furious about  But again  It was done in a way  Where he had to react  So why wouldn't McChrystal  Who's obviously a smart guy  Like there's quotes he gave  Where he said  It was a very difficult  Waiting period  During the three months  Where he had to wait  For Obama to make the decision  Or whatever  On sending the troops  He said that was a very  Difficult time  Even that's an inflammatory  Inflammatory quote  Like that's the type of  Quotes you can give  That are kind of 
[01:10:30]  I found that time painful  McChrystal said  In one of several  Lengthy interviews  That's a rough quote  To say about the president  But the thing is  As a general  It would be painful  You're sitting there  Watching your guys die  You need more men  You're saying  I need this  And the president  Is dilly-dallying  And not making a decision  On something that  You're there  You're the guy that's there  You know what you need  Right  And based on  Nothing but pure politics  You've got to wait  For the president 
[01:11:00]  To make up his fucking mind  No the general's  Telling you what he needs  Give him what he fucking needs  Well that's what I'm saying  That to me is a type of a quote  Where it's inflammatory  But it's completely legit  Right  Like that's the type of thing  That you can get out there  To get what you need  But the other stuff  Is just like  What are you guys doing  That sounds like  You just had it  Acting like guys  Yeah  They were just acting  Like guys  They were too comfortable  Yeah  Sounds like you just had it  Yeah man  But it's not that  He just had it  He is always like this  No we get that point too sir  But  It finally  It poked its way out  To the surface  Right 
[01:11:30]  That's just the type of guy he is  And that's what he does  To get the results  That he feels  He needs to get  You know what else  He couldn't just resign  And then come out in Rolling Stone  And bash the president  He would have looked very bad  Doing that  So if he did want out  And thought this would be  A good way to do it  It's perfect for him  It gets his message  That he does not believe  In the president  Of the United States  Out there  But without making himself  Look  Right  Like a guy that isn't  Doing his job  Or that  Retired 
[01:12:00]  And then  Came back with  Sour grapes  Well  In that case  He should not resign today  He should  He should make Obama  Fucking fire him  Think about that  No one gets fired  The resignation  Is a firing  Well  We understand that  But he could say  I'm not resigning  Fire me  I'm not resigning  Yeah we know  There's a lot of fake  Resignations that go on  Because I know Obama  Would have to go  Do I want to look bad  And fire this guy  Yeah  I mean imagine  Stand your ground  And make Obama fire you  We had a hard enough time  Having to come back 
[01:12:30]  From vacation  And talk to Mel  When we almost got fired  Imagine having to fly  All the way from Afghanistan  Just to go into  Your boss's office  To get fired  And Obama is fuming  The oil spill  He looks bad with  Yeah yeah  This  He's just annoyed  He's not in a good mood  Yeah I wouldn't want  To deal with him today  But Obama to this guy  Is not a Mel Carson  Type of boss  He's like  Some of the other bosses  We've had  Yeah yeah  That's how he's  Looking at it anyway  He's getting scared of Obama  He's not scared of Obama  Like we were scared  Of Mel Carmeson 
[01:13:00]  At the time  You know what  He'll do great  In the private sector  He'll fucking be  One of these guys  That'll be on all  The news programs  Fox will pick him up  He'll do just fine  He'll do just fucking fine  Let's go to Brad  Brad what do you got on this  Hey I kind of think  This sounds like  A coup d'etat  You guys are saying  That you think  He wants to retire  I'm not saying  It definitely is  I'm just saying  Back you know  A few years ago  Even a hundred years ago  If you were to  Fuck parliament  Or any kind 
[01:13:30]  Of political power  And you were the general  Doing it  That was a coup d'etat  You have all the military  On the hands  Coup d'etat  Right now you got  Right now you got  Obama  Who wants to  Be enacted  This  Well  Have allowed  Gays in the military  And now they're making  These anti-gay comments  Or whatever  In the  In the magazine  I just  To me  I kind of think  This is him  Trying to buck authority  This happened  This happened between  MacArthur and Truman  Also  Last one fired by the way 
[01:14:00]  Yeah yeah  Oh really  It happened between  MacArthur and Truman  Over the Korean war  And the fact that  MacArthur wanted to  Get in there  And get into China  And start fucking up  The Chinese  Wow  And Truman's like  Nah  I don't really think  We should do that  Truman was right  And MacArthur was  MacArthur wanted to use nukes  I mean he really  He really did not want  The Chinese  Helping out North Korea  And he let it be known  That he wasn't happy  With Truman's decision  And Truman told him 
[01:14:30]  To go take a fucking hike  Go screw  Yeah  Truman's the guy  By the way  That did drop two bombs  On Japan  So  Better  Good we didn't fuck  With China though  Good you know  I'm glad we didn't  Fuck with China  Yeah at the time  That's a tough one  What are we doing in Korea  Like the whole thing  I don't care if they  Fucking fuck them  Yeah big ally at the time  Cold war  Yeah  It was a different time  There was the domino  Theory that they had  That if you let one  Country fall to the commies  All the rest will 
[01:15:00]  And they didn't want to lose  Southeast Asia  Eh  That was the time  That was the thinking  And mindset of the time  In hindsight  You look back and go  Yeah it's stupid  Good fuck them  Let them go commie  But uh  At least that problem  Is taken care of  And they're all getting along  Fine  Fucking half a  Well they're not  Half a century later  Yeah  Oh literal Jim  If they're getting along  We're the archers  Of enemies here  Oh Chip  Love Chip's political commentary  Yeah  It's general 
[01:15:30]  I just come back  And go  Okay I said it  You know  It's like  What am I doing  I mean it was  One of them things  You know  That's a good point  Some more of the phone calls  That we're not going to be able  To get to  Brian in Ohio  I think the whole thing  Was planned by McChrystal  We kind of said that  Chris on Long Island  There's no reason  McChrystal should resign  Yeah exactly  Let Obama fire you  If you're that brave  Abe Lincoln  Had a general  That bad mouthed him  Hold on  I got a text  From Patrice O'Neill  Oh shit  Racial mutiny 
[01:16:00]  White people hate  A nigger boss  Patrice sent me  Patrice  Patrice will be here  Very soon  He's driving  And texting  Obviously  You can't  Out of the Poconos  You can't wave your dick  In front of the bus  And expect to keep your job  I think McChrystal  Understands that  Mike in Queens  You need to follow orders  And respect higher ranks  In the military  McClellan gave Lincoln  A lot of shit  Someone said that  McClellan gave Lincoln  A lot of shit  But yeah  But McClellan  Was a fucking pussy 
[01:16:30]  McClellan had huge army  A huge army  And didn't do shit with it  He sat there waiting  For shit to happen  Never went in  On the offensive  He was a coward  McClellan  He stunk  And then he wanted  A bad mouth Lincoln  Believe me  There's plenty of things  You could bad mouth  Lincoln about  But when you're a faggot  That isn't going  Across a river  And taking care of  Some hillbillies  You gotta go  Patrice O'Neill  Everyone 
[01:17:00]  Patrice  Hey  I was just  Listening  I was hoping  Somebody white  Would call in  You guys  There's no racial  Nothing  To this  There's no mutiny  Of the nigger president  Nothing  I'll tell you what  On a countrywide scale  Not at all  I don't think so  Patrice  Only because  Military guys  Like if  If what's his name  If Colin Powell  Was still the chairman  Of the Joint Chiefs  Or when he was like  A four or five star general  I don't forget what he was  They respected and listened to him 
[01:17:30]  Because he was a commanding officer  I mean  I think  He was also  But he was also down with  I mean really man  I  I can't believe  It's like  Not even a drop  Where it's not even  Just this general  Who's doing this  It's  On a countrywide scale  It just seems like  The country  And everybody  Is like  Fuck you president  No this is something  I don't see as being  A racial incident  And believe me  I try to find race  And everything  It's just  You feel it 
[01:18:00]  But again  You can't really have  A conversation about it  Like it's hard  But you just feel it  That even  During Katrina  Bush wasn't  People call Bush dumb  And all that  But you never felt like  He wouldn't put his  Fucking boot  On the whole country's neck  To say I'm gonna do  What the fuck  I want to do  Well  Are you kidding  He took so much shit  And racial shit  No no no no  No I'm saying he did  Bush  Bush took a lot of shit  As a president  People's  But you never felt 
[01:18:30]  Like the country  Was like  Fuck you  Like you  You never thought that  It feels like somehow  I'm feeling like Obama  A little bit  Like if I was that  I'm feeling like  Damn this motherfucking country  Is like  Patrice  That was  That was not us  Hanging up  No we didn't hang up on you  On uppity Patrice  That was  That was  Was he driving  Yeah  Of course  Okay so that was probably  He probably went to the tunnel  Well he'll finish his point 
[01:19:00]  He's coming in  I see  I don't see this as being  A racial thing  No  I see this  And Obama had  A lot of support  Amongst his own  They said  Constituency  They said he voted for Obama  He voted for Obama  Oh really  Yeah  And he had a lot of support  Obama's supporters  Are not  Supporting him like they were  During the election  Of course not  And that is because  They don't like the job he's doing  It's not all of a sudden  They turn around and realize  He's a black man  As the president 
[01:19:30]  You don't just go  Oh my god he's watched  Oh I don't like him anymore  And I think it's the same thing  With this general  I think it's a professional matter  Not the racial stuff  I think this general  Didn't like the way  Obama was handling  The conflict  And the general  Knows better  What to do  Over there in Afghanistan  Obama wasn't  Listening to him  And he's pissed  I bet you the general's idea  This is not about  A black thing  He's looking at Obama  As if he's this little  Fucking  Like liberal 
[01:20:00]  Who's never done  Military service  That's probably the way  He would probably look at Clinton  With a very similar disdain  Although Clinton  I think was a more savvy politician  Because he had  A longer time in the game  But I think  Believe me  If fucking Obama  Was a conservative  Guy  Or a guy with military experience  He would  There would be a lot more  Respect from the military  It's not about him being black  Yeah  When Colin Powell  Was the fucking general  He was respected  Listened to  And nobody fucked with him  Nobody  And then  When he went to the UN 
[01:20:30]  And babbled out  A bunch of George Bush's  Bullshit story  Yeah  About Iran  Or Iraq  He did catch shit  But it had nothing to do  With race  It had to do with  Oh my god  This guy went up there  And just had  Bush's  Crap  Falling out of his mouth  And when he got called out  On it  People lost a lot of respect  For him  But not because of his race  And when  Whatchamacallit  Condoleez Rice  Was the  Secretary of State  She was 
[01:21:00]  You know  There weren't all these guys  Saying her  She's stupid  Or military guys  Weren't bad mouthing  Not to my memory  I don't think it's about  Having a black boss  So where do we go from here  When is this all going down  Whenever he flies back  Yeah it's a long flight  He's still flying  Well that's gotta be  A long flight for him  I hope there's beverages  On board  Oh yeah  Sometime today though  I think so yeah  Yeah  Yeah that's good  To say the president  To allow yourself to say  The president was intimidated  And uncomfortable 
[01:21:30]  With all the military  You say that publicly  He knows  He's had it  There's more to this story  And this guy  You know  He's been in the shit  He knows  He knows the deal  And he's  He's qualified  So I'd like to see  Who gets the job  After this guy  And what the qualifications are  And if it's a political move  Based on  On Obama's part  Or if it's an actual  Very qualified man  That's gonna go there  And take care of business 
[01:22:00]  Sure  Let's go to  Tony  Black guy from Atlanta  Because it's important  To the discussion today  What do you got Tony  Hey what's going on boys  Hey Tony  Hey yeah  I'm a black guy  I'm from New York  Originally  I voted for Obama  You know of course  Because he was black  I wanted to see  A brother in the office  But a lot of people  Are taking shots at him  And like the first year  You know I defended him  I'm like nah  You know  It's just the race card  It's the race card  Alright  A year's passed  Alright let's step in reality 
[01:22:30]  He's being too quiet  He's too conserved  And it's  It's given off a vibe  Like okay  He's confident  He's comfortable  He knows what he's doing  I bought that  I got it  I'm like guy  You know he's falling back  He knows what he's doing  Now it's at the point  Where I'm getting a little  I'm getting antsy  I'm a little irritated  And I'm like  A lot of people  Are taking shots at him  He needs to just get pissed off  And fire back at everybody  And what Patrice said  I agree with him  Push was a fucking idiot 
[01:23:00]  A dummy  He didn't  He was just  An ignorant person  But one thing  He wasn't afraid to do  If his back  Was against  Against the wall  In the situation  With Iraq  Or whatever  He stepped up  He didn't care  What anybody thought about him  Or his ratings  If he had to make a move  In Iraq  Afghanistan  Or whatever  Obama is just too quiet  He needs to step the fuck up  He's a brother  Yeah that's cool  I get it  Now if he wants to see  Another election in office  He needs to step the fuck up 
[01:23:30]  So yeah  I'm glad McAllister took that shot  I'm glad he said  You know the White House  A wake up call  Because he needs it  He needs it  Him and Biden  Do you think that  It seems to me like  And again I'm a white guy  Maybe there's certain things  I don't notice  But it seems to me  Like this is just  Presidential criticism  Policy shit  Like the oil spill  I'm not hearing any racial stuff  It's like he's not doing  The right thing  He's kissing the oil company's ass  You hear that about  Every U.S. president  They kiss the oil company's ass  It's the same thing  You heard about Bush  It doesn't always have to be  A racial incident 
[01:24:00]  Sometimes the president  Can just be an asshole  And be doing something  That he shouldn't be doing  And in this case  This general said some shit  He probably shouldn't have said  I don't see it as being  A race thing though  No, no  It's past the race thing  It's all politics now  And that's fair ground  I'm with that  And I actually  I agree with you guys  I definitely agree with you guys  And I'm kind of glad  He blew some smoke in the air  And woke Obama 
[01:24:30]  Or the White House  Or his press  I'm glad he woke him up  Because I'm getting pissed off  He needs to step up  He needs to show  Hey, hold up  I'm the president  I'm making the decisions here  Fuck that  He's going to be a one-termer  If he doesn't change things  Around with the way people see  Are viewing him  He's going to be a one-term president  Yeah, he's out  And Fox will get  The one chick  The hootlers  The chick up in Alaska  Pass that  Oh, Jesus  She'll never win this 
[01:25:00]  She'll never win  World War III in 2014  Nobody wants to listen to her  On a military scale  Nobody  Would trust her judgment  All right, Tony  Thanks for the call, brother  All right, boys  Dave in Connecticut  Has something very important  As far as this goes  Something we haven't thought of  Dave  Hey, good morning, guys  Hey  I was thinking about  The guy who called in  And mentioned that  McChrystal was in the  Black Ops for 20 years  You've got to think  If you're in that type of situation 
[01:25:30]  For a long time  You're very calculating  You know, the risks  You're going to take  How come nobody brought up  The fact that  The guy probably did this  So he could free up time  To go see Jimmy Norton  At the Black Ops  Oh, my God  Oh, my God  Wouldn't it be funny  If Obama said that?  Oh, wow, I think  We have to fire him  Before July 2nd and 3rd  When I'll be in Atlantic City  Oh, that would be fantastic  Thank you, sir  Patrice calling back  He found the hotline  Patrice, what happened  To your phone?  Tunnel? 
[01:26:00]  You know, driving  Through the tunnel, dude  You know, I just wanted to  I was listening to this dude  That just called in  The black dude  Tony  He explained it  Better than I did  In terms of  I'm not saying  Hey, it's a  It's not  It's less racial  Than it sounded  What I was saying  I'm just saying  The way it looks  He's  It's getting  The way  The way people  Are coming down on him  It's  It's really like  A lack of  Of this  Respect  That I've never seen 
[01:26:30]  A president  Really get  On that level  Without putting a book  In somebody's ass  George Bush  Got the least respect  Whether you think  He earned it  Deserved it  Or not  George Bush  Got the least respect  I've ever seen  A president get  Ever  People give Obama  People give Obama  A pass  Because of his race  They give him a pass  That's very fair  That  That  That  Bush got a lot  Of like 
[01:27:00]  You are  He's dumb  And this and that  But something about him  Still  You  He  You never  Felt  Like people are like  Fuck him  He ain't my boss  He  People  Were afraid  And the world  Was afraid  That that motherfucker  Would do something crazy  Like he didn't  Give a fuck  Alright  Obama has a thing  Where the way it's going  It may be because  You know  The country  Is so white  That maybe 
[01:27:30]  Even on a political level  It's always going to feel racist  But  I think maybe  Maybe  Maybe  It's just weird to me  Maybe the fact that  He flew around the globe  For the first six months  Of his administration  Apologizing  To the world  And bowing to leaders  And kissing the ass  Of France  And all these people  That have just  Bad mouthed us  Maybe that  Didn't help either  I mean  He's not  He doesn't come across  As a strong  A strong  President  That people fear 
[01:28:00]  He comes across  As a guy that  You know  Yeah  Very diplomatic  He'll sit down  And talk with you  And shit like that  But a president  Can't  A president needs  The fucking  You know  Speak softly  But carry a big stick  And Obama  Doesn't have the stick  I don't think that's  I don't think that  That's what's happening  But I think  The scary part of this  Is now  Okay  He's gonna fire  This general  He's gonna try  To clean up  His own house  And it might get  Scarier  If now  The next two years 
[01:28:30]  Obama's trying  To make everybody  Respect him now  In house  Not  Not on a  Global scale  Cause on a global scale  He's  The system  He's down with  The system  On a global scale  He's down with  All that shit  You know  The  He's not trying  To really control  The world  He's down with  This new shit  This new world shit  But in  America  Now he's gonna  Start firing  Generals  And putting boots  And getting rid  Of Rahm Emanuel  And he's gonna 
[01:29:00]  He's dusting off  The country  Which is  It's gonna get  Ugly  Cause he gotta  Prove he's the boss  Now  Right okay  Yeah he has taken  A lot of criticism  For not being  Presidential  And now he might  Overdo it  By  Doing things  Like this  Yeah  But I do think  Though  It really did  Anthony raised  A great point  About how  Of course  Little weird  Things about  Like the bowing  Which is not  He's not a  It was just  A protocol mistake  That he's made  A few times  But he hasn't  Come off looking  Like Clinton  Was a 
[01:29:30]  A democrat  And I think  The military  Didn't respect  Him a lot  The way that  They would have  Respected a guy  Who served  But he came off  As a guy  Who would put  His foot in your ass  And Obama  Has not come off  Like that  He came off  As a  You know  He just  I mean like I said  Man having  It started with me  By having that beer  With the guy in Cambridge  You know  It just  You just can't  Let people  Tell you what to do  And sometimes  You have to be  You know  A little bit  You know  Spiteful  Almost  To say 
[01:30:00]  Alright you tell me this  I'm gonna go left  If you say right  Just to let you know  That I'm running this shit  It just seems like  It seems like a  Mutiny to me  That's all  He's not a rule  A whole mutiny  A national mutiny  I don't know  He's not a rule  With an iron fist  Kind of guy  And Jimmy Carter  Had the same problem  He wasn't respected  Because he was  The consummate diplomat  Always trying to  Please everybody  And never wanting  To really  Put his foot up 
[01:30:30]  Someone's ass  And get the respect  That you need  Like Ronald Reagan  Got in office  And did what the fuck  Ronald Reagan wanted to do  And if you got in his way  You got his foot up your ass  Obama does not  Come across like that  I don't think he can  Because he's not  That kind of person  You know who was  A good president  For stuff like this  He was underrated  He was not a great politician  Was Bush senior  Because he was  You know again  He was a fucking CIA guy  Was in the military  And when  When first desert storm 
[01:31:00]  Happened  The whole world  Was kind of like  Ah we don't know about this  The country was again  They went in  Did what they said  They were going to do  He did not make  The stupid move  Of going into Iraq  Because he knew  There was no exit strategy  Right  It was like  He played it smart  And he just ran  A shitty campaign  Against Clinton  And really should not have lost  Read my lips  No new taxes  Sunk them  I've just never seen  Anybody who played it dumb  Get  Like Obama's not even  Playing it dumb  He might be playing it  Soft maybe  Right 
[01:31:30]  But it's like  This country  Rather have  What seems to be  I mean  You know  A dumb  A dumb  Guy  Running it  And you feel  More comfortable  Than maybe  A corny  Weak  Smart guy  I mean  I don't  I don't remember  All I remember  From Carter  Is the  Iran  Thing  And it made  Everybody go  Oh he's a weakling  Right  You know  Someone else  Would have went in  And killed them  We don't negotiate  With terrorists  And Obama's not  Doing anything  Dumb  He's just not 
[01:32:00]  Doing anything  That says  Ooh  I could  He's gonna put  A boot in my ass  If  It's just  No respect  For the guy  He does  But I think  It's more  Based on his actions  Than anything racial  I really do  I mean  This guy  Especially worldwide  You know  He's not looked at  As a strong  President  Yeah  Where are you  Betrayed  How far are you  I don't think it's  Race  I'm just  Traffic  And things 
[01:32:30]  And I'm coming  Breaking news  General Stanley  McChrystal  Arrives at the  Pentagon  Oh good  Boy is that  From NBC News  Uncomfortable  You think he flew  Commercial  His American Airlines  Flight is delayed  In Dubai  Yeah  You're not gonna be  Able to make it  Wow is he not  He's in deep  Deep trouble  A lot of phone calls  Coming in  We'll take a break  Continue with the  Phone calls possibly  We got Sandy Kane  Coming in to talk  About the naked  Cowgirl thing  Patrice O'Neill  Is in traffic  He'll be here soon

[01:35:00]  About General McAllister  I keep saying  And I said it was  Somebody from  The Kennedy administration  And I'm now  Being humiliated  It was the general  From Lethal Weapon  That they kept  Instead of McChrystal  Like you said  McAllister  If you make that mistake  We have no business  Doing this type of discussion  Dude I am such an asshole  This type of a discussion  But Patrice was talking  About you know  It gives it a racial thing  Or whatever  The way that they're  Kind of saying  We don't want a black boss  And the more I'm reading  About this McChrystal  And his staff  They don't respect 
[01:35:30]  There's one thing  Team McChrystal likes  To talk shit  About many of Obama's  Top people  On the diplomatic side  One aide calls  Jim Jones  A retired four star general  A clown  Who remains stuck in 85  Politicians like McCain  And Kerry  Said another aide  Turn up  Have a meeting  With Karzai  Criticize him  At the airport  Press conference  And go back  To Sunday talk shows  Frankly it's not  Very helpful  Only Hillary Clinton  Receives good reviews  From McChrystal's  Inner circle  Hillary had Stan's back  During a strategic review 
[01:36:00]  And she said  Stan wants something  Give him what he needs  That's the only one  They like  Is Hillary  Really  Of all those people  So if you think  They have trouble  With a black boss  I mean they're willing  To have her  Which is kind of  A woman with man's legs  Boss  Hmm  Interesting  I never would have  Thought  Yeah  Especially because  Hillary  I bet you  She makes a run for it  Oh yeah  I bet you  She makes a run for it  I was just saying  There was some kind of  Poll that was taken  That said  That she  Has like a  Presidential approval rating 
[01:36:30]  Bigger than Obama  And any of the candidates  That they would put up  Against her right now  So she'll run  More importantly  What is Patrice making  Over there  Paper  Paper airplane  No you made a little  Delicious thing for yourself  Oh the crystal light  Oh you're doing  Crystal light action  I stopped for a while  But  I love the crystal light  Water's starting to  Taste like  Garbage  After a while  It's like enough  With the water  I gotta spice this shit up  Boring  Fucking lizard piss  I need a drink  Why'd you stop

[01:39:00]  Maybe it hits 50  He'll get out there  What's his stance  Is it cause she's  Calling herself naked  Or  His stance is this  He saw an opportunity  To get himself on TV  He's using Sandy Cain  To get some publicity  That's all it is  Does he need more  He's a fucking  He's second to the  Statue of Liberty  He loves when people  Talks about him  Yeah  That's all this is about  He's not gonna go  And sue Sandy Cain  It's not worth it  There's nothing  He can do  She's pretty much homeless  She has no money  And she's gonna continue  Cause she's an asshole  Yeah  And we love her  They have a cease and desist 
[01:39:30]  That's gonna kick in July 1st  That she can no longer  Do that  By the way  Who gets to say that though  Exactly  She'll be there  Hand me his lawyers  She'll be there  And then what are they gonna do  Like serve  Serve her another thing  Or make her go to court  She's not gonna do  Any of that shit  I tell you  Before Sandy gets in here  I saw a fucking documentary  I Am Comic  Yes  I saw it  I thought it was one of the best  Oh really  Comic  Comedy  Things 
[01:40:00]  Cause it had a sidebar  Rich Shiner  Remember Rich Shiner  I was frustrated by that whole angle  That he put himself  Into the documentary  No  They put him in it  Cause he knew everybody  Somebody explained it  And then he  But then he got  He started wanting to do it again  But the thing is  The thing that got me  Is uh  I mean this is a  This is a day late  In the dollar show  But I really feel bad  For uh  Joe Rogan  And  Carlos Mencia  Joe Rogan  Really  He  You know  And I know  He probably  Anybody that says  Is like  On his side  Or whatever  He probably 
[01:40:30]  Go fuck you  Cause he went through  A lot of shit  Dealing with Carlos  But Carlos finally  Just said  Admit it to everything  I fucking steal  Why can't we have that clip  We've talked about this  Two or three times  On the show already  He basically  Admits everything  No not basically  He says  And his attitude  I'm being polite  His attitude was this  Like  Yeah I fucking steal  If I'm in the back  Of the fucking room  You better watch  Your fucking material  Cause I'll take it  Remix it  And make it a hit  Just like a rap guy  Cause I'll add  Mexicans to it  Well that means  Somebody is old royalties 
[01:41:00]  And somebody  You made a lot of money  Off of these  These people  That you steal from  But he's justifying  By saying  If rap artists  Could take someone's  Like old song  And make it  I understand  But that's  That's basically  What he was saying  If a rap guy  Could do that  I could do the same thing  And make it my own  And the argument  Against Carlos  Would be  That a joke  Is contingent  Upon catching you off guard  Music is not  Like a joke  Has an effect  The first time  You know what I mean  It's a different thing  And could you please  Stop saying a joke  This is the thing  That kills me  I'm reading  Is that a good call 
[01:41:30]  Back in the day  People stole jokes  It was like  Two Jews  Walked in the bar  That's what it's meant  It's meant to be told  Everybody  Carlos is taking  Fucking  Your life's  Analogies  Man  Yeah because  These are stories  Based on your life  And you're a little  Twist on them  And then just  Like you said  Adding Mexican  He was also  In it  Saying  Hold on  Why don't we just  Play the clip  Wait wait wait  I just want to say  He wasn't  Yeah  That he  This is not just  The clip  He's in the whole  Thing saying 
[01:42:00]  Here's what the fuck  You're supposed to be  As a comic  If you ain't  This is a comic  You ain't shit  If you ain't  That is a  And then he says  I steal  Which nullifies  He doesn't have  A position  No  On comedy  It  In  That means that  What's those  Cover bands  Don't need to say  They're cover bands  Yeah they can just  Say they're the band  Well fuck you  I'm  I'm journey  I'm playing  I'm fucking journey  Nigga  I'm Mario Speedwagon  I'm fucking  How about you just  No you have a different name 
[01:42:30]  And you play  All their songs  And just say  Yeah  And just say  I can't believe  He did this  My song  Like he admitted it to it  It was a bad move  Well the quality's  Not that great  But this is what  We got on the fly  At least  Let's play this  Carl's  Admits to stealing  On this documentary  It's on Showtime  I believe  It's really  Really well done  Hit it  Really get  Last wrung out of it  A lot of people  Out there  Are going to ask  Why did they interview  Carl's  About this  You know  Carl's is a joke thief  Carl's steals jokes  And we know this 
[01:43:00]  And listen to me  And look at me  When I tell you this  With all honesty  If you think  That I steal jokes  Fuck yeah  You're right  Of course I fucking  Steal jokes  Are they out of  Your fucking mind  When I come to a  Comedy club  You better run  Bitch  You better get  The fuck off stage  Because if anything  You say is even  Remotely funny  I'm going to make  It mine  And all I'm going  To do is say  Mexican in the front  I'm like a rapper  I just sample shit  And make it my own  Was that really my song  I don't know  But it sounds like mine 
[01:43:30]  But it kind of  Sounds like somebody  Else's  It's a hit bitch  Is he being ironic  The only thing  I want to know  Is did they edit him  A certain way  I'm not saying he's right  But was he saying  Oh yeah  Is that what you want  To hear that I steal  Sarcasm no  I'm not saying it was  But you never know  How they edit that shit  That sounded really bizarre  It does sound bizarre  To admit it like that  What is he saying  About that  Because this documentary  Is everywhere  People are watching  This fucking thing  He doesn't look good  That pisses a lot 
[01:44:00]  Of people off  Especially in your business  Just about everybody  In your business  Because it makes  It makes up and coming comics  They see Carlos  He's winning  Right  He has money  He shows fame  Multi-millionaire man  And if you're in it  For that  Then you come in  And go  Why would I ever  Work hard  On my own material  Why would I suffer  When you could just  He just justified it  For all the young guys  Coming up  So now you got  A young guy coming up  He could just try  To do Patrice's stuff  Or Jim Norton's stuff 
[01:44:30]  I'm just gonna steal  Which people do  People steal  But it was always  One of those things  Like you don't want  To be caught stealing  And right  Everybody does it  Like no  But now he's saying  Hey it's okay  Look what it did for me  And that's what I'm saying  It destroys  That's really bad  Everything  And you know  Carlos is a likable guy  I like Carlos  I see him  He's not a guy  He's one of those guys  You can't hate  So it's like  But he really  He has no stance  On anything else 
[01:45:00]  In comedy  He can't say  Here's my philosophy  Right  When you're  A thief  Right  Like you're  Justifying stealing  There's nothing  On any level  But the bad part  Is Rogan was on this  And you know  They ended up  Pushing him out  Away like he was  A nutbag  For going this hard  I wouldn't go that hard  Because there is no justice  Because he's gonna  Still win  My thing is  Who I'm mad at  Not at the business  I'm mad at any person 
[01:45:30]  After he goes  Yeah I fucking steal  You better watch out  And this and that  That go see him  Yeah that's gonna go  See him  Are there fans  That do that  Hold on hold on  Happy butt  Jesus from Ann Arbor  Carlos Ned  Had a meltdown  On Twitter  After this came out  Google it  So maybe  Maybe there's more  Info to this whole thing  Google it  Google it  Yeah  Why  They take him  Out of context  Maybe  Alright  But we should be  Seeing the  Carlos Mencia  Media storm 
[01:46:00]  Yeah yeah  He should be out  There going  They fucked me  On this  Right  That's Carlos' style  But you see how  He set it up  As if it was a joke  It was  I can't believe  It was out of context  But if it was  It was  Because it's possible  But he just  He's like  Then someone fucked him  I want to know  If there's more info  On this whole thing  Because then someone  Fucked him bad  I didn't see any  Editing in that  No I did not  I didn't see editing  But I'm seeing  What Norton's saying  Is like maybe  He could have been like  Oh you know what 
[01:46:30]  Yeah I'm a fucking thief  But that was  At the beginning of the conversation  That could have  Came in after something was said  Right  Like what do you want me to say  What do you want me  What do people want Carlos to say  Hey  And then all of a sudden  I'm not saying that  He doesn't steal  But that's a dirty cut  If that's what it is  If he did that  He blew it  Because no one is buying  You're right  That's how he meant it  At all  So maybe that's why  He had the meltdown on Twitter  Maybe it did backfire on him  I don't know  I remember  Yeah when I saw that too  I was like  That is really fucking weird  The documentary in general 
[01:47:00]  Was great though  I enjoyed it  I thought it  It's a sad life  You guys have  It's a mess  It's a sad life  That's what I got out of it  The one that got to me  Sad  Dana Gould  The one that like  Where he goes  Man I was in the  I was doing three shows  I was in the first ten minutes  Of the first  Of three hours  That I had to do  Meaning  The first show  At the first ten minutes  And I had to do  Two more shows  After that  That evening 
[01:47:30]  And I said  What the fuck  Am I doing  What am I doing  And I felt that  Where I'm like  Hey  And I went  Holy  And the crowd's not really  Loving me  Automatically  It's not just  Okay  It's like I gotta work  And I just go  Oh my god  Wait what was it  He was having a bad show  No he's just  Oh there was a segment  Of quitting  Oh  Like of guys  Like another guy  Was like  I get on stage  Some guy you never heard of  But he goes  I'm Tim Allen's friend 
[01:48:00]  I'm talking to Tim Allen  I'm talking to this guy  Then I get on stage  And a guy got his foot  On the stage  And he's half holding  His girl's titty  And looking at me like  What the fuck are you doing  It was a good  God damn documentary  It was well done  Yeah it was one of the  Best ones  Yeah the guys explained  Why they got out of it  It was  That was a sad moment  Like you go  Fuck balls  I felt like that  And then the people  Explaining the comedy  Condo  Where you guys  I'm sure you  Did you ever stay  In the condos  Very early  Yeah well  I got lucky  Being in New York 
[01:48:30]  Well you gotta explain  That though  The comedy owners  Instead of putting you guys  Up in hotels  They're like  You know what  I'm just gonna buy  A local condo  And just put the comics  Up in this condo  And it's just a shithole  Arizona  The last condo  I stayed in Arizona  In 1999  It was just like  It's like a hotel  They don't take care of it  It's just a mess  And it's  You know it's  Disrespect  Instead of putting you  In a nice hotel  Where you can  Fucking order room service  You're stuck in the middle  Of a highway  And this shit  And somebody picks you up  You know  Unless you rent a car  But it's 
[01:49:00]  You know people go  Shut the fuck up comics  But  You fucking do it  You know what I mean  It's like  That part on quitting  And then Rich Shiner  Made a decision  To come back  And just to see  What he was going through  As an open miker  That no one knew  Cause he's been done  For 12 years  And I'm gonna tell you  Show business  Keeps you looking  Much better  Than you should  Tim Allen  Who started  At the same time  Shiner  Comes and he's  Looking relevant  Snazzy shirt  Looking young  Looking delicious 
[01:49:30]  A little dye  A little dye in his hair  Shiner's looking like  Got the glasses  A little designer action  Yeah man  And it's like  Stay in show business  Don't quit  Stay in the business  There's something about it  That keeps you fucking  Keeps you looking young  Yeah it keeps you looking  Looking young  Somehow  Shit  I'm telling you man  His stuff on stage  Was rough too  But I mean  He was just starting  His comeback  And he was a monster  He was  I vaguely remember him  Seeing his face  HBO specials  Back when those  Were big time  Yeah man 
[01:50:00]  He was a bad dude  And why did he quit  I forgot what they said  Cause he was like  He's like  Look  It's like  I'm paying for  I'm paying to keep  My family  In storage  Like I'm  Like I'm  Paying for storage  Really  My family don't see me  Store your family  Yeah it's just  That makes sense too  You just  You get home  On a Monday  And you leave  On a Tuesday  Like back when people  Did Tuesday through  Oof  You know  They did three shows  On Saturday  Yeah so you're just  Paying  You're making money 
[01:50:30]  So you can pay  To keep them eating  And a roof  Over their head  That you'll never  Share dinner with  Or live in the house  That does seem  A little odd  And he said  Something else  You either  Two kind of comics  One that goes  To the people  Or one that  The people  Goes to them  Yeah  And that hurts  Wow  Wait wait wait  How come that hurts  Because  Going to the people  Means you gotta go  Where the gig is  Right  When people come to you 
[01:51:00]  You go to the gig  And the people  Come see you  Do they mean that  Or do they mean  Attitude wise  Oh they don't mean  Like the way you perform  It means like  I gotta do a cruise ship  That means I gotta go  To the people  To the people  Okay  You're going to the  Oh you mean success level  Yeah  We might have  We might have more info  On this  Jay in Staten Island  Jay  Hey happy birthday Jimmy  Yeah  Hey listen  Mark Maron did  Over two hours  Of podcasts  On this whole thing  Episodes 75 and 76  Can I slow you down  For a sec  Did they specifically 
[01:51:30]  Talk about this documentary  That Patrice is mentioning  Specifically  Okay  And he spoke to  Carlos Mencia  For over an hour  Then he talked to  The guys that  Worked with Carlos  Then he went back  To Carlos  I started off  Hating Carlos  Then I loved him  Then I hate him again  Now he's just a douche  Well what did he say  About this documentary  Was he being serious  Sarcastic  Was it  Did he get edited badly  What happened  No I mean  He basically admitted  To Mark  That yeah  He stole  That yeah  It was just  One of those situations 
[01:52:00]  That guys that worked  For him  He figured that  Because they worked  For him  It was his material  He's just really  Kind of a douchey  Thing to do  Yeah  And you do feel  Bad for the guy  But to listen  To Mark's take  Was very interesting  Because I mean  Obviously Mark knows  A thing or two  About a thing or two  You know  But hey Patrice  Patrice  Yeah  I loved you  On Arrested Development  Oh thanks bro  Best character ever man  For real  I liked you on that too  Yeah I'm sorry about that 
[01:52:30]  Thank you bro  Listen  I know it's two hours  Of you know  Listening to Mark  Talk to these guys  But they have  Really good stories  And really good insight  And you do come  Come away  Knowing the whole story  And I agree with Patrice though  Because Carlos  Is a likable guy  Like that's  Like we flew together  I forget where I was  We were on the same plane together  And we were just kind of  Walking a baggage claim together  And it's like  He was talking about  Stealing on something  He said something  About a Cosby bit  He's like  I did it  And then someone  Said the Cosby  He just started talking about it  Yeah but  Yeah but  He said he never  Saw the Cosby bit  Alright you talk 
[01:53:00]  Alright you talk  You would die  Alright Jay  That's alright  I just talked to him  I know Ernest Eager  Alright Jay  Thank you  Let Jim Norton finish  What happened  I don't know when  This was filmed  But he said something  About a Cosby bit  And he goes  And I did it  Maybe he didn't say  So maybe he said  Somebody told him about it  He might have said that  I don't want to misquote  The guy  And he said  And I was like  Holy shit  I can't believe I did it  He was like  Making it  Like saying like  He didn't know at the time  That's what he was saying  To me  It's an all time Cosby bit  Look it  I let it go  Because people  Have thoughts 
[01:53:30]  That are similar  But it's an all timer  It's from his  Which Cosby bit  It's the one  Where he essentially  Oh sorry sweetie  It's the one  Where he essentially  Oh you look uncomfortable  I didn't help you out  I didn't want to have  Pickle juice all over  I'm just starving man  It was essentially  Essentially  The bit was  How fathers get no respect  And he teaches his son  From the time he's born  To the time he's  Like fucking able to walk 
[01:54:00]  How to play football  And how to lift weights  And how to do  Boom boom boom  And he's just doing  His whole thing  And Cosby's building up  To this crescendo of  He scores a touchdown  In front of 800,000 people  At the fucking stadium  Oh thanks mom  Yeah yeah  I love you mom  I love you mom  Right  Or hi mom  Or whatever  Yeah  Carlos  Took it  Remixed it  Are you shitting me  And made a hit  That is such a  That's a Cosby bit  It's a Cosby bit  Like everyone knows that one  So you would have to know that bit  But it's like  It's like look  I could have looked by  I'm gonna tell you 
[01:54:30]  Something  I was in awe  Of Carlos  At  When we did the Baltimore  Virus tour  Baltimore  Booing him  Jersey  It was Jersey  No no  That was Baltimore  That was Virginia  I know  I know it was  Cause we was  We was  I did a radio  With the sports guys  Oh okay okay  And  And um  Look at this guy  And Carlos  Is a nice  I don't dislike him  As a person  I wish he didn't do that  So I could just 
[01:55:00]  You know  But he  They come out  And they were booing him  It was a  A lot of people  Booing him  And  Enough where I said  Oh he's gonna  Get off stage  He's gonna be ugly  Right  He turned that shit around  Like I  Like I mean  I've never even seen  No shit like that  Yeah yeah  Where they hated him  Off the bat  And they tried to hate him  And he beat their hatred with  So as a  But after he goes  I steal  With this pride  And you better watch out  Cause I'm gonna take it  It just  He becomes  He's a vaudeville guy 
[01:55:30]  He's not  I'm gonna wanna know  He's not a soldier  Like people like  Rogan is  Rogan has never been accused  Of stealing  Nope  Ever  And not cause he'll  Punch you in the mouth  Rogan  Is a deep  Dude I talked to Rogan  He's a fucking  He got magical tattoo  Rogan  Is a  Yeah we know  We all know  He's a fucking floating  He probably floats and shit  And leaves his body  And all kind of shit  He actually does float  He's got one of those tanks  Yeah he does  Rogan  Is the real deal  When he's talking about his shit 
[01:56:00]  Yes  And  Let me amend one thing you're saying  You know  I'm just saying dude  Rogan is a drug addict  Continue  But  But he makes it sound so cool  But that's  But do you know  That's  It's just  And no one  Usually the one thing about comics  Even though  We hate each other  Comics will rarely  Like  Lie  And say  You a hack  Or you're a thief  Right  Right  And you're not  They might go  Nah  It just ain't 
[01:56:30]  But it's been going on so long  And Rogan took an L  A little bit for it  No one else stood up  But that's the way  That's the way  The business is  It's like  I would never  Modern myself  To stop Carlos  I just look at  Now Carlos  Like  You have  Like  They kept interviewing him  During the thing  And it's like  You know what  You don't have  Any more  Theories  You know  After you rob a bank  I don't want to hear  Your theories  On hard work  And success  Like here's how  You make it 
[01:57:00]  Unless you  Unless he breaks  Unless you rob a bank  Go to prison  Come out  Work from the bottom  If he  If he just  Did that again  But it would take  10 to 20 years  Let me ask you this  Now  This is the sad  Part of the whole thing  Doesn't Carlos  Muncie have a  Shitload of  Original material  I don't know  We don't know  He's an Iranian  These are all things  That I don't give a fuck  About until you just say  I steal  Well what's your thought  On that  He's a  He's  I don't know  Do you think  Most of his stuff  Is stolen from other  Comics that came before him 
[01:57:30]  And he made it his own  Put it this way  Or do you think  He has a lot of  Original material  And unfortunately  With the stealing shit  Now everyone thinks  He just steals all jokes  Let's  Let's watch  Okay  Here's original material  Like what I'm trying to say  Is he just never needed  To steal  Here's original material  I'm  I'm Carlos Muncie  I talk like a Mexican  But I'm  I'm from  I'm  Iraqi  Or whatever he is  That's original  That  Because you know  Something about him  Like he said  He said his act  I  Mexicans 
[01:58:00]  I mean  Play his act  There's nothing about it  Like I'll talk about  Having diabetes  That's not  You don't find out  That I'm fucking  Completely healthy  Yeah  You don't find it out  You don't go  This fucking cocksucker  Stole my disease  There's too many people  That have said this  There's too many comics  That have said  That he steals  For you to just go  Well it's just a bunch  Of comics saying it  Like  If it was one comic  You might think  Someone had an axe  To grind or something  But  Jesus Christ  It's been forever 
[01:58:30]  And now he admits it man  It's just  Now admitting it like that  And if there's no backlash  And I'm not trying to  Ride  Get  But if there's no backlash  From people  That means it's like  I'm performing in front of  Like maybe some people  That would  That  I go  Why don't I just steal  Why the fuck  Don't I just steal material  That's  Just like rappers  And I don't condone that shit  But just like them  I go  Look  I'm gonna pay  Some young guy  Who's been in the business  Six months  Has a great premise 
[01:59:00]  I've seen it all the time  Great premise  Doesn't have the skills  To make that shit funny  I've been there  There's times  When I started  Where I go  Man I got this great bit  You know  In my mind  But it's just not gonna  Execute  Cause I'm not good enough  To skillfully do it  And so why don't I just  Give this guy a hundred bucks  Who needs it  That's his first comedy dollar  Let me take that bit  Cause I see the magic in it  And don't give him a dime  At least Carlos can say  I pay these guys  Their royalty fee 
[01:59:30]  Yeah  Something  That's what rappers do  They go look  They don't just go  Man I was sitting in the back  Of the room  And watched James Brown  And said  This old fool  Motherfucker  I'm gonna make me a song  They gotta pay that nigga money man  And his estate  But that's  They don't have a choice in that  Thank you  They don't have a choice in that  It's set up that way  And if you can prove  Like fucking Jay-Z  Doing Forever Young  Drives me insane  Cause I remember the original song  But he has to pay  He has to pay  I think it was Alphaville  So whoever owns the rights  To that band Alphaville 
[02:00:00]  Is getting paid  Because Jay-Z  Decided to make it his own  This might be precedent  Because he admits  I've never heard anyone go  I steal comedy  This is possible  It's bad for the business  To get a couple of dollars  Wow  To fix that  But we gotta make it clear  That that's why  No one's ever gotten  Fucking sued before  Yeah  Cause we have similar  See a song  Is copy written  I can't copy write  My fucking  Jokes and say  An idea  No one else could have  This thought 
[02:00:30]  Because  That's why  When I start off  I watch  If there's a feature  In front of me  I watch  The whole show  The first night  I have to watch  The whole show  To see what this guy does  After he does it  Then I show him  What I do  I go  And he might say some shit  That I go  Fuck  I never go  Hey I'm gonna outrank  Your comedy  Cause I can  I do a bit like that  I'm gonna outrank your comedy  Cause I feel like  I've written enough  So I go  Okay you do that  Okay this guy does that  Now let me show him  What I do  And we all know  We're not gonna step 
[02:01:00]  On each other's toes  Sometimes there's middles  That wanna show me  That they got a bit like that too  I just wanna show you  It's like  Didn't you see  What the fuck I do  I don't give a fuck  That you have a bit like that  And you wanna show me  That you're genius  You fucking dickhead  I'm telling you  I watched you  To go  I'm not gonna step on  Cause I could've showed you  Right  And do it better  You fucking middle  You guys gotta work together  To make the show real good  But that's what I'm saying  There's respect  That you wanna have  In this game  And Carlos just said 
[02:01:30]  Fuck  The game  And just to  And he's winning  Well to simplify  It's really bad for you guys  Because now young guys  Are gonna think it's okay  And a lot of young guys  Were really scared  To go down that road  He's been humiliated by this  This is a weird  That's what you  What you saw him doing there  It's almost like  If you get caught cheating  And you just go  Yes  I cheated  It's such an admission  Of defeat  It's empowering something  That is just  There's nothing worse  For a comedian  Because Carlos  Doesn't need the money  Carlos is a fucking millionaire 
[02:02:00]  And when you're on that level  You want a certain amount  Of respect  And with a singer  You're right  Patrice  They copyright songs  But when you play  A James Brown clip  Da na na  Everybody knows  That's James Brown  Nobody thinks  That's your song  Everybody knows  You're playing  A James Brown clip  It's not like that for us  Not only does everyone  Know it's James Brown  James Brown's getting  A little taste  Right  Or the people that own  The James Brown thing now  Which makes me say  Sampling James Brown  Sampling Elvis  And all that shit  Whatever you want to sample  To sample  That's why I think  People who are 
[02:02:30]  Into hating  Led Zeppelin  Led Zeppelin  For what they did  Yeah  Are like  You're stealing from  Nobodies  And you're becoming  Famous  Like Carlos  It goes in the back  Of the room  He doesn't look at  Tim Allen and go  You know what  I'm gonna steal  Tim Allen's grunt  Some new kid  He's still some young kid  Who needs that fucking joke  That could have been  He needs that joke  That could have been  The joke that got him  On Leno or Kimmel  Or something  Have you been doing it  For 20 years  If you can make up 
[02:03:00]  I mean this is  I have some  Some buddies man  That I found out  Was tasting some jokes man  Tasting some jokes  And I had to fucking  Talk to him  Cause I go  Look man  You have to learn  How to have people  Not laugh  That's the key  To creating jokes  You got to  Fucking toughen up  And bomb  You douche  Carlos is a killing machine  He doesn't know  How to bomb  So he's never gonna go  I'm gonna sit in a lab  And make experiments

[02:41:00]  At life  You just  You just explode  It's like the  End of Saving Private Ryan  When he asked  If I was a good man  Let me tell you  I was almost murdered  A few times  Was I a good man  Was I worth  All those men  Dying for  And look at Sandy  I had an equity  Good woman  Am I doing alright  Yeah  Let me tell you  How about the prior  What's going on  Hold on  She said that  She was almost  Murdered a few times  Oh yeah  Richard Pryor raped me  He  No this is a true story  Richard Pryor 
[02:41:30]  Was it funny  Yeah  Sorry I just want to  Make sure people know  We don't know  If this is a true story  She's saying it  This is a fucking true story  Richard Pryor said  Hey bitch  You want  You want to snort cocaine  With Miles Davis  So I said yeah  So we went  In a stretch limo  Miles Davis  This is 10 miles  Of bad road  Miles Davis baby  I said yeah  I want to meet Miles  And I want to snort cocaine  So he pulled up  To his three back hotel  On 49th street  And I said  Miles lives here 
[02:42:00]  So anyway  We go up in a sleazy elevator  Miles Davis lives here  But I'm just thinking  Me and Richard Pryor  He takes a key  Opens the door  I said where's Miles baby  Where's the cocaine  He says there ain't no Miles  There ain't no cocaine  I want to eat your pussy  Wow  Yeah  So then he got me on the bed  And he did  And then  Did he have a big dick  Pryor  Yeah  Good  Did he put it in your shitter  Were you willing at that point  Or were you willing  No hey  It was like  He was on top of me 
[02:42:30]  And it was kind of a rape  And then when I left  You know what he said  So why didn't you report it  To Bill Cosby afterwards  So that  He didn't come to jail  You know what he said after  Leave the pussy bitch  When I left  Well that sounds like Pryor  Leave the pussy bitch  What does that mean  That's good  Leave the pussy bitch  That was a good Pryor  Yeah  That was a good Pryor joke right there  Leave the fucking pussy bitch  Leave the fucking pussy bitch  No I said Richard  You're a real dick  You still call him Richard  I called him Richard  You're a real dick 
[02:43:00]  So um  Even after he raped you  You know you're a great  Rate victim  That's a much better word  After he raped you  And then the trucker  That raped you  And then you went to breakfast  With him  Yeah  Yeah  True story  What could you do  Um  Call the cops  I don't know  Call the cops  Go to the hospital  I love how back in the day  A story could be that  Like  Of course  Like women just  Took it on the chin  Like yes  She was raised  What is that  That's it yeah  A lot of women still  Take it on the chin  We both lit up a lucky strike  And I continued down

[02:55:00]  In your life  He's like somebody  You know  Of course he is  Do you feel like  He's another person  That turned on you  And I'm not saying he is  But do you feel like  You trusted another person  That just mistreated you  How would you like  If they turned on you  And sued you  Right  I would hate it  You know  Right  It's good to see  All of a sudden  Yeah exactly  It's not show friends  She came back last week  My mother hung up on me  The other day  It's almost like  He dumped me for her  A street wife  Wow  And you've been treated  Again  You've been treated badly 
[02:55:30]  By a lot of people  And she just turned on  The young one  Like the young one  Was like  Oh my gosh  She's my new auntie  And then she's like  Hey she's gonna dump me  For this cop  Bitch over here  And she's just like  Damn  I felt bad for her  It's fucking  No I mean  It just happened  She came back last week  And all of a sudden  I got papers  Let me ask you  Do you want to talk  You can't talk  Because you're litigating  So it's almost like  You and your friend  Have this thing  Between you now  You can't speak to him even  So what would you say to him  If you could say it to him  Perfect  Because that's what  You know  Like the media said that  Channel 4  I said  Why don't you go over 
[02:56:00]  And talk to him  He was right across the street  No I mean  I think  He hates me  For  I think  You know  I think maybe  Because he's jealous  People have said that  He's like jealous  And you know  The cop's like  Tits and ass  You know  And you know  He's been doing  The same shtick  For 13 years  You gotta change  No but I mean  Not even on that  There's no act of suing you  Exactly  As your friend though  Like what would you say  To your friend  Who betrayed you  Because I know  This is not just about money  You feel like a guy 
[02:56:30]  That you really trusted  What would you say to him  Jimmy's got a great question  What would you say to him  If he's listening right now  Not even angrily  Most likely he is  Because we had him  On the phone earlier  So what would you say to him  As a friend  Right now  You know  I'm just saying  Him and his fucking manager  I spoke to him  On the phone last  Before this happened  He says  You are a classless person  You have no class  My manager is good  You are bad  Your music sounds  Unprofessional  Not like mine  Mine's great  You suck  That is exactly  What he said to me 
[02:57:00]  So I'm going like  He's very angry at me  Problem  Why is he angry at me  Right  Because he couldn't change  He's 40 years old  He's got to re-fucking invent himself  So don't blame me  Motherfucker  For stealing your  When I lost my television show  I couldn't sue anyone  I lost it  I moved on  I had to move on  You've had a lot of stuff  Taken away from you  It seems  That hasn't everybody  Though  Jim  I mean  You always reinvent yourself  Opie and Anthony do  Yeah we have to reinvent ourselves  I mean  And 40 years old 
[02:57:30]  Is a big time  In a man's life  Don't you think  40  Yeah it's tough  It is  It's tough  And he's going through that  Right now  He's 40 years old  A little midlife crisis  Kind of a thing  He used to be there  Every fucking day  Every fucking day  He's not there anymore  But I don't think  He has to be  Because he makes  So much money now  He's got all this  Commercial stuff  He's big  He's like established  His name  And now he's got us  Hustling out there  And every time  Someone sees us  They think of him  So he doesn't even  Have to be out there  Wow  What do you think of that  When I think of that 
[02:58:00]  I think he misses it  He misses being out there  He loved being out there  He was like  All those girls  And everyone  You know  Just exalting him  He loved the street  He was you know  The king of Broadway up there  And now he's not  It's not fucking working  It's not working  Oh shit  No like my television  Just wasn't fucking working anymore  It's not fucking working  You know  And he's out there  And he's just not fucking working  You know  Sometimes you want it to work  And it's not  That's the story  With the naked cowboy  So he's suing me  He wants my fucking money 
[02:58:30]  And her fucking money  And it's like  You know  Hey fuck you naked cowboy  That's what I say to you  Whoa  Right  No  Fuck you man  And we support you  Sandy Kane  I'm fucking out there  I'm fucking hustling  I went topless yesterday  So you say  I'm stealing your thunder  I'm really stealing it  Because I'm fucking  My titties are down  Yeah  Damn  That's it Sandy  My titties are down  They certainly are  Oh yeah  I  I had your feelings  I did  I'm betraying 
[02:59:00]  I go what  You know  They're actually suing me  What the fuck  I don't think  Jimmy Walters  No I don't think  I don't think  Because you know  The lawyer told me  There's a distinguished  People don't think  You know  There's a distinguishing thing  Between a woman and a man  I'm the cowgirl  He's the cowboy  I'm the cowgirl  Yes  You're the cowgirl  You're the cowpatty  Listen  I've been the cowgirl  For three years  But she's paid her 
[02:59:30]  She's the cowgirl  Who's as far as  You know  Legally being able  To be the cowgirl  And people look at her  And go  Oh that's the naked cowgirl  And I'm the original  Yeah and you just came  Kind of swooping in  I'm not against you  Three years straight  Three years straight  I've been  She hasn't  She just came last week  And how long  Are you staying  Naked cowgirl  I'll be here till September  See but isn't she  So I'm just here  I'm just here  To make money for school  And it's really  I don't know  Do you live with  Do you live with  The naked cowboy  No I don't  He lives in New Jersey  Do you have a boyfriend  Do you live with a boyfriend 
[03:00:00]  Really  Well I have a boyfriend  And he's from Italy  And he's coming over  July 8th  And he'll be living with me  Oh good  And I'm so excited  We have this like  International love affair  It's awesome  Wow  Amore  Amore  Hey  He's Italian  Anthony's Italian  Hey  Yeah it's so nice  Anthony see if you can  Slip or something  Before this guy gets here  Before her dago shows up  Yeah  He came to live with me  For three months in Portland  And then I went there  For spring break 
[03:00:30]  And then now he's coming here  So  Yeah  This is going to be  The deciding factor  If we get married  Is he going to teach you  How to drive  Sunday Monday  Wednesday Friday  And then the car blows up  And you look like Sandy  Oh poor Sandy  I'm kidding  Sandy knows I'm joking  Poor Sandy  She's getting beaten up  This week  She's getting a bad week  Now  Pouring her heart out  I'm glad I'm with you guys  And I hope you  You support me  With this lawsuit  Because it's  Well you know  We're your true friends  Yes  We tease you  But we're your true friends  We do tease you  And I'll admit  Sandy  Sometimes we go 
[03:01:00]  A little too far  But you know what  We've been  A radio family here  For many years  And you are included  In that radio family  Yes  You're the part of the family  That we don't really want  In the pictures  Right  But you're  Always  Always in the YouTubes  But you know  That you're loved here  And this is a place  Where you can come  Where your friends  Are  You know  I'm going to tease you  A little bit  But that's what we do  Today man  Today we're comics  You know  I mean comics  And the cowboy  Also feels bad about  He tried to do comedy man 
[03:01:30]  You don't just get up  And be the belle  Of the comedian world  Lou Ferrandi  Just throw his fucking ass out  I can only imagine  What he says  Like what does the cowboy  Have to say  Like he just says  The same thing  Over and over again  Wow you're trusting  The cowboy now  I like  I'm just saying  I can imagine him  As a comedian  Girl power  I like this  What does he say  In Times Square  Because I've never seen  Him do his thing  I'm the naked cowboy  I'm the naked cowboy  But it's just funny  Because he has  These funny lines  He stinks  He's horrible  Once you hang out  With him  He doesn't know  How to play guitar  You just get used  To his lines 
[03:02:00]  But I'm just curious  What he would have to say  In stand up comedy  I would love to see a show  I parked at a red light  He was at him  Doing fuck songs  He was doing  We fuck for fun  Oh yeah  That's right  Yeah he did a fuck song  And my baby  Farts when she comes  And he makes his money  By selling what  Pitches for ten bucks  No he doesn't charge  I don't think  He does charge  I think it's for tips  Isn't it  No it's ten bucks  I think he charges  Ten fucking dollars  He's not going to  Call it tips  Sandy's emotional today  Is it like your  50th anniversary 
[03:02:30]  Of menopause  That's funny  No I think  My heart is open  Unfortunately not  And I'm really glad  To be here  You're an open person  Like you allow yourself  To be teased  And stuff  But you're a pretty  Open person  And you know  People forget  That you have feelings  Too  And that you know  Getting kicked around  It sucks after a while  And this naked cowboy  Is trying to destroy you  Destroy your livelihood  And kick you out  Onto the street  Yeah it's like  Right  You're taking my job away

[03:03:30]  Get a career one day  Like you  But what do you want  What do you want to do  Get into social work  Probably do counseling  Of some sort  Probably and hope  You're just  You're a mess  You're a mess  A lot of probably and hope  Back when I was a horrible  Human being  Those are words I look for  Probably hope  I think  You're just a mess  Well no I mean  If you want me to be like  Direct and assertive  With what I'm saying  Yes I do  I will be a counselor one day  I am going to school  No one dreams to be  A fucking counselor  Graduate  Oh yeah  Well my thing is this  You're a naked panhandler

[03:07:00]  That he was honest  So what is the story  Of this naked cowboy song  The story is  I said to him and his manager  Why don't you put your voice on it  Maybe we can do a collaboration  And get a deal  So I mailed the manager  And I gave Robert  He was in Times Square  A copy of  He told me how to love  Sandy Cain featuring the naked cowboy  And I told him  I'm writing the name  So you can see  When it's on billboards charts  Featuring the naked cowboy  I told him 
[03:07:30]  It never  It never came out  The song never came out  He never put his voice on it  Because he wanted $5,000  So  And so this is the  Song with a male voice on it  Sandy Cain  Featuring a male voice  And it was originally  Since I got back from Miami  Things just ain't been the same 
[03:08:00]  Since I met that man named Bobby  I know how to play the game  He told me how to love  He showed me what to do  He told me how to love  And I looked at him too  He told me how to love

[03:11:30]  But then you just watch her  And her fucking virtue  And her horse shit  She don't know what she's gonna do  She's gonna end up like Sandy Cain  She doesn't wanna be a counselor  No one wants to be a counselor  She just said that definitively  That I wanna be a counselor  Especially at 27  When you're in the public eye already  Making pretty good money probably  And then all of a sudden  Really gonna give all that up  To be a counselor  She's way past her  Doing something years  Yeah she should've  Been doing something  You don't do nothing  You already been doing it  For seven years  You made a choice  If she's standing  On the fucking corner there 
[03:12:00]  After 25 years old  There's a problem  I'm telling you  That's a  She's  You know  God bless her  I hope I see some  I'm hoping there's some  Naked something of her  Her perky titties  Really?  Little sweet tits in there  Yeah  But she was a mug  Yeah  Just  A mug  No woman  Wants to be called a mug  No  The cowboy hat  Dressed her up nice  The cowboy hat  So she took that hat off  She took that hat off  She had a head like  Bluto from Popeye 
[03:12:30]  I'm not gonna put up  With her fucking  Standing there  Bluto  If she gets competition  From a higher chick  It's very easy to do  You were annoyed  Because we were trying  To get out of the studio  And her guitar case  Is in the way  She's in the way  And you're just like  Will you just fucking move  I gotta go take a leak  Just there  With her fucking  Special equipment  You just weren't feeling it  Her fur guitar case  And her shitting  How about Santa King  Almost completely breaking down  She does that anyway  She's never  Come close to that 
[03:13:00]  Never even come close  Never come close  To showing an emotion  Never  Really  Not even close  A little anger  When we do shit to her  But never that  Never  So the naked cowboy  Thing got to her  And the rapes  And the violence  It's a weird thing  She's doing  Like she's looking at things  And going like  I've really mistreated my  Like she's really feeling  Lonely and awful right now  So you're saying  She blamed the rapes  On herself  Like it's just  She ends up in bad situations  Because no one  Is serial raped  Does that even happen  I know  She was a sex worker though  Like she was a fucking  Strip 
[03:13:30]  Like she did  Peep boots  Peep shows and stuff  All sorts of shit  That whole thing  Where she was describing though  How it was a good feeling  Like  That's odd  It was a connection  And then  Yeah yeah  Some kind of connection  She'll get died  She'll die  Lost her mind  Or she wants to live  It's like the cock  Was life  The cock to her  Was life  Now she's trying  To get raped  Yeah  Jesus  Not even close  Wow  She opened up though  Yeah  Those big eyes  She's pretty 
[03:14:00]  See I'm telling you  I'm looking through  The oldness  Oh yeah  Tough to do  She has big  Beautiful eyes  That lady  Like  She's not an ugly woman  At all  We can't find an old picture of her  I wish she knew  What she looked like  In her old days  There's a curiosity  I would love to see  What she looks like  In her product  Now we've seen her younger  But like 20 years ago  But she was still like  Dicey  Remember the interview  We saw her  Didn't we see her  Do an interview  Where she was like  Even that wasn't like  That old  She was still pretty old  Yeah that's what I'm saying  It was like 20 years ago  60 then  Yeah  Yeah I want to see a picture 
[03:14:30]  Of her like in her 20s  20s man  Cause she's  She's a pretty woman  Man  Big eyes  Big eyes  You see that she  I can't look through the old  May have been  You can't even  You can't look through the old  I can't chisel through that  You see those eyes man  You see where she  She just was  Oof  She was  I bet she was better looking  Than this one here  The young one  When she was younger  When she was that age  I bet you she was  A better looking woman  Than this fucking one  Y'all  Yeah I wouldn't bet you on that  Twirling around  I wouldn't bet you on that  I'd arrest her too 
[03:15:00]  If I was a cop  Just for audacity  Really you think you're hot  Just for big mutton head  A lot of people reacting  To that segment  Pirate trucker in Nebraska  What's up  I was gonna call in  And say you should hook up  Victim number one  With Derek  Victim number two  And send him up to Harlem  But then I started  Feeling bad for Sandy  That was kind of like  You know  Trying to put your grandma  In a home  When she doesn't want to go  I just felt bad  That is fucked up 
[03:15:30]  You know what  The naked cowboy  Is doing just fine  He's got all these  Products and stuff  He's a piece of shit  He really is  In the end  Just leave her the fuck alone  That's pretty good  What Anthony should do  Is wait for the naked cowboy  To sue and get control  Of Sandy Kane  Then sue and get control  Of the naked cowboy  Because Anthony's the original  And then he'll have control  Of Sandy Kane  Now I think that  The naked cowboy  I think honestly  Tried to let her do her thing  For a long time  Like he never bothered her  Until she's just 
[03:16:00]  But how much money  Could she be making  Or he's making a big deal  Out of it  Can you imagine if that was  If that monster  Took your brand  And was standing there  You'd be like  Is she really though  I mean it's not even  It's not even close  To the same thing  He's a fucking street bum  Who made good  I don't know how  He's doing it  I don't know how  There's not other men  Just like  Oh I'm in good shape  Let me go pretend  To play guitar  Yeah  Try to give me a season  Desist  I'll punch you  In the fucking face  Yeah  You'll fight over it  Like how does he  I know he probably  Has to have a permit 
[03:16:30]  To be there  And all kind of goofy shit  But  What's all his products  By the way  What is he fucking  Naked cowboy  Draws probably  He said oysters  He said fucking  You know  Because that's like  An aphrodisiac  Probably deodorant  It's the world we live in man  There's people out there  That eat this shit up  Obviously  Because he's making  A good living  Fucking some fucking  Home bum  That looks like Thor  And he can't play the guitar  And he's fucking  With old Sandy  Who's trying to make  Two dollars  And you know  No one's fucking  Giving her money 
[03:17:00]  Yeah how much money  Could she possibly  Be making  The next couple days  A lot  Because she's been  All over the news  But then that'll  Yeah  And the cops  Probably fuck with him too  Just let that old  Fifty dollar t-shirt  Yeah  What  Yeah what does he  Got on his site  Fuck is that  Fifty bucks for a t-shirt  Are you kidding me  Who the fuck  Would wear a naked  Cowboy t-shirt  Well  And you guys  Interviewed him before  Special mention  In a song  Performance  On a CD  I didn't like it at all  Ten thousand dollars

[03:18:30]  And put on a concert  For your event  You must provide a venue  You can charge admission  Promote your product  And make your money back  Anything with him playing  Like with him  That would show  Why he's worth  Twenty thousand dollars  Yeah twenty thousand  For him to fucking play  Well if he has a website  You would assume  He would have a song  Or a sample  Yeah maybe a sample  And if he doesn't  That would say  A lot  God damn  That's pretty bad
