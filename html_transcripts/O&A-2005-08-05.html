<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show, broadcast live from the X Games at the Home Depot Center in Los Angeles, was a chaotic and highly offensive spectacle.  The broadcast began with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with Kenny and Jimmy, recounting their disastrous trip to LA.  This included Ben's loud snoring on the plane, a passenger's repeated vomiting, a crew member sleeping in the aisle, and a drunken dinner culminating in a nearby domestic dispute and arrests.  The show featured numerous guests, beginning with Tess Sewell, an X Games announcer, who described the extreme sports and the athletes' injuries.  Jay Moore and his girlfriend Nikki Cox shared their distaste for *March of the Penguins*.  Motocross rider Steve Drew discussed the risks of his profession and his day job.  A listener called in to request a shout-out for James Ward.

The broadcast continued with a hilarious book review described as "one of the funniest shits" they’d ever read, sparking Mormon jokes.  The show was rife with crude and sexually explicit humor, including descriptions of "golden showers" and "Monster Rain," along with graphic depictions of bodily functions.  Technical difficulties with Jimmy’s headphones added to the comedic chaos.  Personal anecdotes followed, including a story of one host explaining "Monster Rain" to a woman, a bizarre restaurant encounter with a man in a strange hat, and a hotel stay with a tiny pool and a broken shower.  The hosts also discussed a disturbing image of a starving child in a newspaper.  An outburst from "Bernie," who left after his CD was taken, briefly interrupted the proceedings.

BMX rider Ryan Nyquist was interviewed, a conversation that spiraled into discussions of sponsors, injuries, women in Los Angeles, and further sexually explicit jokes.  Alan Cook and other guests made brief appearances.  The hosts repeatedly plugged their book, *Gasping for Airtime*, throughout this segment.  The conversation frequently returned to sexually explicit exploits and offensive comments about people's appearances.

An extended interview with several motocross riders followed, focusing on their experiences, injuries (one rider lost a kidney and nearly his spleen but returned to competition quickly), and opinions on other riders, particularly Robbie Knievel, who received harsh criticism.  The discussion included detailed descriptions of crashes, comparisons of Evel Knievel's and Robbie Knievel's sexual prowess, and repeated vulgar and sexually explicit comments.  Ronnie Feist, described as the "pimp" of the group, was a prominent guest, along with Jeremy (a recent competition winner), Doug Henry, Chris Fillmore, and a humorous, extended attempt to get Zach Wilde to admit to wearing a dress as a prank.  The hosts interacted frequently with Kenny and briefly mentioned Howard Stern and Don Imus, playing Imus' criticism of a t-shirt designed by Opie's brother.

A segment dedicated to watching and commenting on motocross stunts followed, with creatively vulgar names for various tricks.  A listener, Dale, called about a DVD box set, leading to a discussion of post-production issues and Nikki Cox’s departure from a show due to a dispute with Ben.  The hosts then recounted numerous anecdotes about a former Viacom employee, Eddie, described as "mentally challenged," focusing on his incompetence and incompetence and laced with racially insensitive remarks.  Several more motocross racers, including Eric Foskrum, Benny Carlson, and Johnny Murphy, were interviewed, focusing on their racing experiences, injuries, sponsors, and personal lives.  Opie’s description of a recent sexual encounter where he wasn't charged sparked a comparison of the hosts’ attractiveness to Charlie Sheen.  The segment concluded with more comments on the motocross event and Johnny Murphy's book.

The final segment included vulgar language and offensive jokes. The hosts speculated on a Senate race between Katherine Harris and Bill Nelson, and discussed a news story about a man with a padlock on his testicles.  Numerous sexually explicit and racially charged jokes followed.  Jay Moore promoted his book. The show ended with a new bit, "Bombs and Flubs," highlighting on-air mistakes and failed jokes, particularly those by Opie and Jimmy Norton, further showcasing the show’s consistently offensive and crude humor.

[00:00:00]  Thank you. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Hey, Ben, where's the quality?  He rocked.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you're stinky.  You are cordially invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  The show is a disaster.  The show is a disaster.  The show is a disaster.  If you have any poo, bring it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Thanks, Steve.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program. 
[00:04:30]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Oh, what a complete fool.  What an idiot.  Right off the bat.  Can you actually say, we're on?  You're up.  You're up.  You're on.  We knew.  We were letting the ambiance speak for itself.  The sounds of the bikes out there whipping around the course.  And then Steve.  You're on.  You're on.  I didn't know the mic was on.  I apologize.  It gets all panicky.  We've been sitting here for 20 minutes waiting to start the show. 
[00:05:00]  I ruined it.  Paul just letting the ambiance sink in.  The people understand.  They hear the bikes.  And they're like, oh, that's right.  They're broadcasting from the X-GAME.  Exactly.  I understand.  And outside Los Angeles, California at the Home Depot Center.  Right.  And the motocross guys are just practicing.  And it's just an amazing, amazing sight.  They are some sick sons of bitches, man.  This takes a set of balls for extreme stupidity.  And I don't know which it is. 
[00:05:30]  Because you would never even catch.  I don't even like sitting where we're sitting.  Because we're right on.  We're on the course.  Pretty much.  And that's as close as I ever want to get to what these guys are doing.  I'll be honest.  I like people to think I'm a tough guy.  I wouldn't even walk up to the top of some of these.  It's too high.  It's too high.  And Jimmy?  What about you?  You could get hurt.  You could.  May I make an observation?  Yes, Kenny?  Another sport invented for the Arians.  Jesus. 
[00:06:00]  He always contributes something absolutely awful and awful.  Well, I want to paint the picture here.  We are broadcasting.  All right.  But we're doing a show.  And we're at the stadium where they're doing the motocross and the BMX biking and all that.  And you've got to explain.  Jimmy Gacy.  No, I'm just saying.  You've got to explain the ramp.  It goes to the top of the stadium.  Well, we were informed that they trucked in 300 truckloads of dirt to build these piles, these huge ramps. 
[00:06:30]  But then they have these ramps that go up the seats.  You know, it's stadium seating here because it is a stadium.  So one of the ramps run right up the entire section of seating and the bikes come flying down it into the middle here where it's full of dirt and dirt hills.  And they're jumping over them, getting some sick altitude.  They like to call it air.  Air.  I understand. 
[00:07:00]  Air.  Air.  Lots and lots of air.  There's just piles of just dirt.  I feel like an ant on Ben's desk.  It's filthy.  It's quite a sight, though.  They're just practicing.  And we're going to be talking to a lot of the athletes from the X Games.  Oh, look at this young go-getter.  Our first fan coming by to say hi to the boys.  Oh, look how they come up with that look in their eyes.  That 1,000-yard Marine stare.  They're seeing celebrities.  Hi. 
[00:07:30]  He's wearing his Opie and Anthony Spread the Virus T-shirt.  Very nice.  You got it?  My brother would be proud.  You've got to thank ESPN for having us.  Of course we've got to thank ESPN.  They set up this whole thing.  Yes.  Yeah.  Kenny has decided to do the show with us today.  I guess so.  Usually you do that at the end of the broadcast.  Why don't you just mention who produces it and who is the director?  We're still trying to figure that out ourselves.  We're trying to settle in and figure it all out, and Kenny's on top of it already.  Why don't you thank the food people? 
[00:08:00]  All right, Kenny.  Two Jews walking to a bar.  Thank you to A1 Limo.  What an experience getting out to L.A., huh, Anthony?  Oh, it's always a treat traveling from one place to the other to do this fine program.  And this trip, no exception, Opie.  Of course, we all fly what they call first class.  Well, some of us.  Yes.  Well, I mean the members of the actual program, me, you, little cute Jimmy. 
[00:08:30]  You mean the responsible ones.  Right.  The ones that actually do something.  The ones that actually go to bed at a decent time so they can sound good on the radio.  Or drinking, doing narcotics, and stumbling into their hotel at 4 a.m.  Yeah, Anthony made a good observation on the way over to the Home Depot Center here at the X Games.  You were saying that isn't it our duty to be the ones going out and partying and getting hammered  and barely making it on the air in times of broadcast?  Every other talent, they call it, the talent. 
[00:09:00]  They're always the problem.  The rock band, it's the road manager and those people.  I've got to keep them in line or else you get no show.  That's how it usually is.  In this situation, we, the on-air people, are responsible.  We go out to dinner maybe and then back to the room to go to sleep at a reasonable hour.  Maybe, ooh, watch a movie on the spectra-vision, spank-tra-vision, whatever.  And our crew are the ones that are out partying like a maniac. 
[00:09:30]  Ben, oh, stop.  You, even before the trip, did you absolutely show up in the same clothes you did the show with  on Thursday, on Wednesday?  Dude, when you showed up to my apartment, you were wearing the same clothes from the day before, weren't you?  You traveled.  I brought the same shirt?  Yeah, the same shirt.  You traveled Friday with a, or what was it, Thursday?  I took a shower.  I took a shower.  You did, but you put on the same clothes?  Did I?  Yeah, probably.  Did I?  I walked into the van. 
[00:10:00]  I thought it was Mickey Rourke from Barfly.  I'm like, who is that?  They party like it's 1999.  Very good, Kenny.  There you are.  I mean, whenever...  I'd like to thank Grinch for that song.  I mean, whenever you want, you can turn off Club Soda Kenny's Pike.  It's really up to you.  Trust me on that one.  But weren't you guys out partying down at the beach last night?  Yeah, we just went out to dinner.  We were home early.  Yeah, he calls it dinner.  We went out to dinner.  Most people call that a coke attraction.  We all went out to dinner, Kenny and Steve and Eric. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  Mortified a cab driver on the way home.  Trying to rest in front of the hotel.  Oh, yes.  Someone got arrested?  Yeah, I don't know what that was about.  I remember it was a domestic dispute or something like that.  It was a guy and a girl, both in cuffs.  Yeah.  Nice.  It was like an episode of Cops.  Really?  Filmed on location.  Well, Kenny was telling me this morning...  The men and women of law enforcement.  Kenny was telling me this morning you just wanted to get a quick bite to eat and it turned  out to be a whole thing, right?  Last night?  Yeah.  Yeah, I didn't know that power drinking was the appetizer. 
[00:11:00]  They had a fine dinner.  It's a piece of bread in a case of Jim Beam.  You all doing shots out of crazy straws.  Anyway, where were we?  So we're talking about our trip out.  So, yeah, Ben, a bunch of us, a bunch of the guys decided to show up in my apartment  in New York and then we would leave from there.  Ben shows up from, they stumbled out of a bar and came over.  So it seemed, anyway.  Take over your house because there's no chance of tripping on any pesky furniture or anything. 
[00:11:30]  I don't want to stumble over that.  The brand new apartment.  So, and then we left from there, you know.  But he fell asleep in the back.  I never knew Ben snored.  I thought someone was watching the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan.  What the fuck is happening back there?  He really snores.  He was getting people complaining on the airplane, complaining about his snoring.  That's funny.  Yeah, that is funny.  Not if you're sitting there next to you.  I think an engine exploded.  No.  It's just this big-headed guy.  Well, Steve.  Madden, Steve's this chick next to Steve puking. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, yeah.  I heard that.  Yeah, we just got to organize all this because we don't even know where to begin.  Yeah, Ben was snoring on the plane.  The hot chick, I guess, she was hot, right, Steve?  She was by far the hottest chick on that airplane.  And she was just puking?  Before the plane even took off, I saw her reach for the puke bag and then I just heard buckets  of water hitting puke bag and I, it was awful.  What a coincidence.  She looked fine until I sat down and started talking about navigating my website.  You have to type in one. 
[00:12:30]  How do I download that file?  Well, the funny thing is they call me martini, Steve.  I don't even enjoy martinis.  But, yeah, it was...  You think she was just hungover?  I think so.  I mean, she actually looked like a porn chick, but I didn't really want to say that because  that's kind of crass.  Right.  But she did look like...  Why?  Is she here?  I mean, who cares?  Well, I did have to spend the next six hours sitting next to her.  Oh, you didn't want to say it to her?  Yeah, I didn't want to say it to her.  Oh, okay.  Check her puke bag if it looked like tapioca. 
[00:13:00]  She's a porn star.  She might have been full.  Check her dipstick.  So you had a puker next to you.  I had a puker next to me.  And then Ben was snoring the entire flight, I heard.  Ben pretty much slept the entire flight from New York to L.A.  And Eric...  Sleeping, really, the word for it.  Yes.  People call it being passed out.  Yeah.  That's what he was doing.  He was sleeping off a drunk.  He was taking a little nap.  Face down in the aisle. 
[00:13:30]  Eric tried to record Ben snoring with his cell phone.  And guys were yelling at him like he was a terrorist to shut off his cell phone.  Yeah, you know how they give the instruction to turn off your cell phones on the flight  and you can't use them until they land and open the doors?  Well, people actually think something, you know, the engines are going to quit  if your cell phone is even turned on.  And that's just not the case.  As a matter of fact, they're working on it now, which is going to be horrid,  to actually let people use their cell phones during the flight,  which you just don't want to hear.  Can I ask you fellas a question? 
[00:14:00]  Yes, sir.  Since we had all the fun in last class, how was it in front of the plane?  It's wonderful.  I was not happy at all, dude.  I don't want to complain, but there was not enough brown sugar on my cinnamon roll.  Yeah.  I hate when that happens.  The chocolate chip cookie that they give out, the big hot cookie,  could have been a little bit warmer.  Yeah.  It had cooled a bit on the way down to my roll.  And it could have been warmer.  Well, we had screaming child in first class.  We should get right into it.  This is just an abomination.  With two kids, three seats in first class, even though she was only using two. 
[00:14:30]  She was that rich.  You could tell she was just a rich bitch.  Absolute bitch.  She looked like, didn't she look like that woman that had cancer in Fight Club?  I didn't see Fight Club.  She had the bandana around her head, and she was all thin.  And she had these two kids that I guess are spoiled rotten.  If you're flying your kids in first class, you've got to assume the kids are really spoiled.  They sit down, and already they just start, like, screaming for shit.  And I'm sitting there going, oh, boy.  No, you don't do this. 
[00:15:00]  Anywhere on the plane.  But, you know, if you're sitting in steerage, you have to pretty much expect whatever you get.  When you're in first class, I don't want to deal with that.  I want only fancy people.  Fancy people.  The most noise I want to hear is the clinking of champagne glasses.  That's all I want to hear.  The laughter.  The ruffle of a Wall Street Journal turning.  Look at my bank account.  Let me look at yours.  And then they chuckle.  Things like that.  Not screaming kids. 
[00:15:30]  Screaming.  And this kid went on and on about...  Well, I think I could imitate the kid for you.  All right.  I'll give it a try.  I want candy.  I want candy.  I want candy.  I want candy.  I want candy.  I want candy.  I want candy.  I want candy.  Keep going until noon and we'll be set.  Like times ten.  It went on and on.  And then this rich bitch decides that first class on a plane before it takes off on a long flight to L.A. 
[00:16:00]  is a perfect time to teach the kid a lesson.  Yes.  Where he's not going to get what he wants if he yells for it.  I'm not giving in to you now, young man.  I'm at the point.  I was ready to go.  Will you give the fucking kids some candy so we could all relax?  Because everyone was just getting really annoyed on the entire plane.  Because it was just so freaking loud, this kid.  Yeah.  Where's a pedophile when you need one?  Right behind the kids.  I want candy.  I want candy.  I want candy. 
[00:16:30]  I want candy.  I want candy.  He starts yelling, I want candy.  I want candy now.  And he's screaming now.  Like just asking for it wasn't enough.  Like he assumed in his head, maybe she just doesn't understand when I want the candy.  Right.  Maybe she thinks this is a vague notion that I'd like candy someday.  Sometime.  Maybe when we land.  And she was a sick fuck because she was feeding candy to the little one, the other kid she had,  right in front of the kids screaming for, I want candy, I want candy.  And all she had to do was give the damn kid candy, and that would have been the end of it. 
[00:17:00]  I know parents out there listening, like, whoa, you're not supposed to do that.  But in that situation, you've got to just shut the kid up.  Shut the kid up for everyone else's benefit.  Help out the cabin.  She grabbed the kid's face.  She held the face.  This was a great moment.  I saw it too.  Go ahead.  She leans over with her rich lady long fingers,  holds the kid's face, and lines up a perfect slap.  She cracked this little girl.  Smacked the girl.  Oh, yeah.  Smacked the girl.  Shit right across the face.  Here it is.  Bam! 
[00:17:30]  Oh, it was fucking great.  It was classic.  I almost said, don't do that.  Next time, ball your fist up.  Right.  Oh, my.  Anyone who's against abortion, they should have just videotaped these little fuckers.  Oh.  Horrid.  Hey, you guys, we've got our first guest.  We could jump into some of the other stuff that happened on the way to L.A.  and our hotel and stuff.  But we've got to say hi to Tess.  Tess, how do you say your last name?  It's Sewell.  Sewell?  Sewell.  Tess Sewell knows all about the X Games, Anthony.  He's good.  And you're one of the announcers here at the stadium?  Yeah, I needed a second job, and 7-Eleven was full, so now I'm a TV analyst, too. 
[00:18:00]  Nice.  I have no idea why, because it's not crazy enough here today,  then I have to go and sit in the booth and try and protect the voice all day.  But you know, it sure beats working for a living.  You've got to have the raspy, extreme voice for this, though.  Extreme.  Yeah, coming out over the...  You know, you've got to sound like, you know, pumped.  I'm nothing if not extreme.  Are you extreme?  Actually, what's really extreme is that this stage is in the perfect place for somebody to go wrong on this 75-foot jump.  Oh, don't think we haven't thought about that.  And come swimming straight onto the table. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, if you notice, this jump, the last jump that they're going to be going over here, is where to the side of it.  But it's been known, these guys don't actually go straight over it sometimes, and we are in perfect line for someone to screw up.  And someone may even plan to come here, because they are all clinically insane.  Yeah.  You can't do this and have any kind of urge to protect yourself or any of that, like an instinct in you, self-preservation it's called.  As soon as you even hope to protect yourself, you're going backwards. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  And, you know, anybody that watched the best trick competition last night, these people were bringing out motorcycles no one's ever tried to ride before.  I mean, they pull themselves off the bike 90 feet and somehow try to get all the body parts back on.  Doesn't always work.  It looks like, what it looks like they're doing is, it looks like they have fallen off the bike in mid-jump, and they're clawing trying to get back on it.  But it's all very choreographed.  They know what they're doing.  They're trying out these things.  And last night, we saw a dump that was just a couple of them that was, I mean, the trick was getting a concussion, I guess, was his, and he scored a perfect score. 
[00:19:30]  You know, it's so funny.  If concussion was one of the marks for judges, there'd be a lot of guys doing really well with gold medals around their neck on here.  Who was the guy that just landed ragdolled?  He was out for about five minutes.  And BMX last night.  That was Dave.  Guy went down.  Dave Mayer went down.  Yeah, we had him on the show.  He got up.  He did pretty well.  But then John Parkas, a guy from Arizona, went down hard and got dragged out of the bottom of the vert ramp. 
[00:20:00]  He's fine.  I mean, it's not like John or Dave and a whole bunch of these guys haven't been through it more than once before.  But, I mean, it shows you what the odds are they're dealing with.  They make it look real easy.  Yeah.  You know, every single one of these sports, when Danny Way launches off that huge big air skateboard ramp, he's traveling 90 feet.  He's got a skateboard under him.  Yeah.  It's not even attached to him.  That's the thing people miss.  That skateboard can leave you at any point.  The jeopardy is pretty big, but they just glide through the air and land on that downside. 
[00:20:30]  And I still have no idea how most of them do it.  It is amazing to watch, man.  And they're all just, you see them walking around the facility.  They're all just banged up and beat up.  They've got these huge hamburger scrapes on them.  And they just, it's nothing.  Just another day.  The funny thing is that they're old men at 24.  Yeah.  You know, the first time I ever met Mike Metzger, I think he was maybe 23, and I thought he was an old dude.  Yeah.  I didn't actually realize that the crippled-looking guy walking towards me was an extreme athlete. 
[00:21:00]  It's definitely a sport for the young, because I couldn't imagine anybody getting up into their late 20s, continuing doing this, and being able to walk as they get older.  And the most amazing thing is when we started with a lot of this stuff, it looked as though we'd already reached the pinnacle of what the sports could do.  And every year, they managed to change it and do something that's even crazier.  I mean, the concept of going up and down on a skateboard vert ramp with that tiny little thing under your feet, and that vert ramp is pretty tall. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Then they come up with this crazy idea of doing a skateboard big air, because the vert ramp wasn't dangerous enough.  So let's just jump over a 90-foot gap and see what happens on the other side.  Oh, my God.  That's amazing.  You guys can make a lot of money.  How much can you make to the penny?  Well, first place in one of these competitions, 50 Gs.  See?  50 large for first place.  Which ain't bad.  But I think a lot of the cash comes from their sponsors.  Oh, yeah.  These guys, if you're at the top of this game, you're a guy like a Dave Mira or Travis Pastrana, you know. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, because I see their houses on cribs.  Yeah.  They do good.  Yeah, they're making 10, 20 bucks a pop for those, I guess I think.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  I mean, the X Games are just blowing up, too.  It's just getting bigger and bigger every year.  I think it's getting bigger and bigger, because every year, these guys manage to push the envelope.  Right.  Yeah.  And you think they've pretty much attained all they could attain with a skateboard or a bicycle or a motorcycle. 
[00:22:30]  And they just come back the next year and do something even more nuts.  Well, this year in BMX, I mean, unfathomable happens.  Guys are doing front flips now.  Back flips are not dangerous.  Let's go forward to see what happens.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, you know, when we came into X Games with motocross, we had freestyle and people were  saying, hey, you think somebody could back put the motorcycle?  And we all burst out laughing in the room.  It just seemed like the stupidest idea.  And then year 2000, Kerry Hart comes out, was 40 feet in the air, upside down, with 220 pounds of motorcycle following him. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  And ever since that point, those guys have just gone nuts.  360s.  The body burial that Chuck did last year and attempted last night, and, you know, again, got his bail rung.  And if somebody says, okay, I'm going to flip the bicycle, they're going to say, well, I'm  going to flip on top of the bicycle.  So, and it's not the money they're chasing.  No.  They really just want to, this is in the schoolyard, and they're like, you know what?  I'm better than you.  I'm going to get hotter chicks, because I'm going to do something crazier.  Speaking of the hot chicks, on the way in, we saw all the groupies waiting for the guys. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, yeah.  Was that who those girls were?  They weren't there for us.  Yeah, I know.  They didn't have to sign anything.  I'm sure, and I saw a couple of, you know, I think there were a couple of Opie and Anthony  tube tops.  Yeah, the guys were wearing them, which was really frightening.  We stepped out of our car, and there was all these really, really hot chicks at the  entrance, like, hey, I guess we're doing pretty good on XM Satellite Radio.  They ignored us, and then the bike guys and the motocross guys started showing up, and  these girls were going nuts.  You know who walked up to us?  You see that guy right there? 
[00:24:00]  He's wearing an orange shirt and a yellow hat, and he looks like he has a shovel with hair  matted to it in his trunk.  Look, he comes up and shows us a Jack Nicholson autograph.  That's who we attract.  That's who we attract.  The beauty of L.A.  Yeah.  And then the athletes all have the hot chicks looking after him.  What are the older guys in the competition?  You got any of the older guys?  The ancient, ancient guys in their 30s?  Yeah.  Well, right on the front page of the Daily Breeze, they have a guy on a BMX bike, Jamie? 
[00:24:30]  Jamie Bestwick, right?  Yeah.  34 years old.  Are they older than the old kids?  I'm in a crotchety old English guy.  Yeah.  But, you know, obviously he can still show young kids what to do.  And, you know, you got a guy like Matt Hoffman.  I think he's sponsored by Swingline because his entire body is stapled together.  But they just don't stop.  I don't think they know what they do is, you know, eventually going to send them to an early grave.  And they come out every year and constantly surprise you.  And Jamie Bestwick, for all, you know, of his old creakiness, that guy is so smooth on a bike. 
[00:25:00]  And maybe that's where, you know, the experience pays as opposed to just the zest of youth.  Yeah.  You can tell the old bicycle guys, they have the big front tire and the little one in the back.  Have a parasol.  Nothing.  That's a pretty good one.  Actually, a little kid holding a long loaf of bread.  The coolest thing last night, actually, was Dave Meera showing just how pimp he is.  Comes out on a 24-carat bike.  His entire bike is gold.  Stop. 
[00:25:30]  Really?  Just gold.  Gold bike.  Concussion.  Wow.  Yeah.  Good job.  All right.  Well, when do they take to the dirt?  We've basically got fun going on all day, every day.  We come on again tonight on ESPN, and we roll in with Moto X Step Up, which is, of course, one of those popular events,  because people are going to understand that this guy is going over a high jump.  Wow.  And there's no judging there, the guy either gets over the bar or he doesn't get over the bar. 
[00:26:00]  Jeremy McGrath, the king, won it last year.  What do you mean he just got over the bar?  It's a high jump.  It's a high jump.  It's a high jump on a motorcycle.  Holy crap.  Who doesn't want to see that?  I mean, come on.  Wow.  That's insanity.  And, you know, it's these sort of events that I think we just sit around and figure out, you know,  what stupid thing can we do next?  And it was actually the step up was a halftime show that we came up with when we did freestyle contests,  and we're like, what else could we do to fill the time here because people are running away and grabbing nachos? 
[00:26:30]  So anything ever get turned down because it's just too insane?  You know, nothing.  Really?  To my knowledge.  Yeah, whatever.  There's always somebody willing to do this thing.  We've got to bring fire into it.  I was going to say that.  You beat me to it.  It's like, when do we get to see fire?  Pyro and dancing chick.  Actually, this year at X Games, we have the, I think they're called the Perfect Angels.  Ooh.  We have dancers slash cheerleaders.  Nice.  I hear they're completely nude this year. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, yeah.  The ladies.  In your strange world, they probably would be.  Yes, of course.  But in the world of network television, the Perfect Angels may have a stripe of clothing on somewhere.  Very good.  All right.  Well, they're going to start practicing the BMX thing.  That should make for some great sounds for our broadcast.  Yeah.  I know.  You hear that chain going through the sprockets.  The motocross guys, it was just so powerful and amazing.  And they stopped just as we started broadcasting.  And now we get to hear guys pedaling. 
[00:27:30]  They put baseball cards on their spokes.  Oh, did they do that to make a little extra noise?  I was just trying to be witty.  That was a good one.  And you failed miserably.  No, I thought it was a clever one.  Baseball cards, bikes.  They're wetting down the dirt.  All right.  So it's not to make as much dust.  But we are going to be filth ridden.  All right, Tess, are you going to come back and say hi to us?  I'll come back any time you guys need it.  Did the motorcycle guys kind of scowl at the regular bike guys?  No, it's actually the funniest.  Last night, Travis Pastrana was trying a BMX bicycle trick on a motorcycle. 
[00:28:00]  He modified the thing, put this weird-looking fork on it.  Unfortunately, he hadn't quite got the engineering right,  because as soon as he hit the takeoff, the fork exploded and went the other way.  But they give props to these guys, because if you ever looked at the BMX guys,  they wear a whole lot less padding than the motocross guys do.  And a 40-pound BMX bike can take a pretty decent core sample out of you.  So don't let the size of the jumps fool you.  The crazy jeopardy is still there.  When I was a young boy, I had a chopper bicycle with a big banana seat on it. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, you didn't.  Yes, I did.  The only kid that had that in the neighborhood was the retarded kid.  Like the big forks coming out of the front.  It was like a long chopper.  It was purple, and it had like a banana seat.  Oh, awful.  And I have to say when I come,  but do I have to sit in the interrogation seat when I come?  Yeah, you are in the sun.  It's purposely in that everyone else is shaded.  Oh, no, you can come a little closer.  You can get closer to Jimmy, but you've been trading sunburn for AIDS.  This is like the steerage class of your show.  Yeah.  You're all up there. 
[00:29:00]  I can hear the champagne glasses from way down this end of the table.  You're sitting in first class in the shade all nice.  You can move down if you want a little closer and get in the shade.  Oh, I think I've got to get used to it now.  I've got to go back to my first job and then roll into my second job later on.  Where do you broadcast from?  We actually broadcast here.  We're up above in the stands here.  We actually are in what I think would be some kind of press suite.  And then tonight at Step Up, we're trying something new.  There's a big dirt mound that the guys do this high jump on,  and Cameron Steele, my cohort, and I are going to be right in the bottom 
[00:29:30]  of where I assume the tennis judges or something sits.  So if the guys want to come and mess with us and roost us with a little bit of dirt,  they can just come right over us if they wanted to.  I'm not sure it's the best idea because these guys will always happily do something stupid to us  to inflict any kind of harm.  But, you know, we get paid massive amounts of money to stay down there.  Wear a helmet.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure.  I wear a helmet most days.  See, I'm not as familiar with the X Games.  A friend of mine loves the X Games. 
[00:30:00]  Do you think, like he was saying something about the fact that it's gotten more and more extreme,  is that ever going to make it like a harder sell?  Because when you take it like from one level and make a relative comparison,  people are going to go, well, you know what?  I mean, things are not quite what we were supposed to be.  That's a good question, Jimmy.  You know what's happened with the X Games?  The X Games actually became more focused.  Used to be 20 riders per discipline.  Now there's 10.  So what you've got, this is like the Masters, if you can imagine it.  This is the one event that everybody wants to come in and win. 
[00:30:30]  You know, there are a bunch of tours out there where guys go out, compete, make decent money.  But nothing is the X Games.  And the fact that there's actually less of the quality stuff here, I think that's why it's doing well.  I mean, the ratings are up every year.  So obviously we have to be doing something right.  And, you know, certainly it's not the perfect angels, naked or not, that made this thing go up.  It's the fact that when a kid watches this show, then they know they're getting the absolute best of the best. 
[00:31:00]  And, you know, that happens every night.  Every time we do this, you see the guys, the Jamie Bestwicks, you see the Jeremy Stenbergs coming out  and pulling whatever is the coolest, newest trick that anybody can possibly see.  All right.  When does the coverage start tonight?  Coverage tonight is Eastern, I believe.  Let me think.  I'll calculate backwards, which I'm not really going to do.  It's 9 to 11 Eastern.  9 p.m. to 11 Eastern time.  All right.  They're telling me you have to go and get ready there.  Are you going to come back, though?  He's telling you.  If I'm invited back. 
[00:31:30]  Of course.  Of course.  Of course.  All right.  It's Tess.  He's going to be announcing the whole thing here for ESPN.  Thank you, Tess.  Thanks very much.  Thank you.  I think you guys are going to talk to Mr. Jeremy Stenberg at some point.  Ah, very good.  Gold medalist.  And ask him about his teeth.  His teeth?  His teeth, yeah.  Jeremy, for the whole time we've known him, has had a messed up grill.  And now he has these beautiful, pearly...  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Tell me that guy's not making some scrilla.  I don't know.  We know a comedian named Rich Voss whose teeth are perfect, and he's pretty much a broke 
[00:32:00]  failure.  Well, at least we knew this kid had messed up teeth before he came out here.  But he won a gold medal last night with a great trick.  And, you know, we always talk about...  He's called Twitch because he has Tourette's Syndrome.  Right.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  You know, you imagine you're riding a motorcycle, and you're about to hit this jump, and your  head twitches sideways.  This kid puts up with that every day, and it's not a handicap to him.  He kills it.  That's real nice to call him Twitch.  Yes.  His favorite jump is actually the cocksucker fuck. 
[00:32:30]  And on that note, I think I'll go back to work.  All right.  It's Tess, everyone.  Thanks, man.  We're going to take a quick break.  It's the Opie and Anthony program broadcasting live from the Home Depot Center.  It's the X Games.  When we get back, our good pal Jay Moore will be on the radio with us.  Stay there.  It's Opie and Anthony live from ESPN's X Games 11 on High Voltage XM 202. 
[00:33:00]  I think we're back on the air, no? 
[00:33:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony program broadcasting live from the X Games, Home Depot Center outside  Los Angeles, California.  The virus has spread all the way out to the West Coast, and Jay Moore has arrived with  his lovely, lovely girlfriend, Nikki Cox.  He loved the Penguin movie.  They saw the Penguin movie, hated the Penguin movie.  What's wrong with the Penguin movie?  Everything's wrong with the Penguin movie.  How about giving him a mic?  Yeah, let's give Jay Moore a mic. 
[00:34:00]  Where's Jimmy?  Everyone is getting back into position here.  We also have one of the motocross guys in the area we're going to talk to in a few minutes  here.  That guy's like hardcore, this guy right here.  He's already staking out the course, looking like, yeah.  He was jumping already.  He said, it's amazing.  He's going to tear this place up.  We're going to talk to Steve Drew in a little while.  Fucking green shoes.  Who's he kidding?  Walking around in his Lucky Charm cereal shoes.  He's a tough guy.  He's a tough guy. 
[00:34:30]  What's wrong with the Penguin movie, Jay?  Put your thing on.  The first thing Jay says to me is he didn't like the Penguin movie.  The March of the Penguins.  We walked out of the Penguin movie.  Why?  How do you walk out on the Penguins?  I'll tell you why.  Because they're fucking penguins.  That's why.  What did you think you were going to see?  I thought maybe I'd see some personalities.  Some personalities, maybe like the Fat Penguin, the Angry Penguin.  Like, oh, these two are out of the game.  It's not Madagascar.  It's a documentary.  And Nick goes, well, the problem is the Penguins are, like, not identical. 
[00:35:00]  They're fucking identical.  Every single Penguin.  There's not a feather out of place.  So you can't root for anyone.  They drop the egg.  I'm laughing.  Like, ah.  You're racist.  I laughed at that.  I thought that was hilarious.  I'm a total racist.  When the eggs just fell and just rolled away and that was it for that couple.  And then it didn't match.  The voiceover's like, they will huddle like this for the next month.  And then the next shot is, like, 50 walking this way, 20 walking over there. 
[00:35:30]  They're kicking the fucking eggs like they're playing bocce ball in a manner.  They're like, yeah, I dropped my egg.  Me too.  He'll switch your fucking Penguin.  Who gives a shit?  You got to think some of those penguins dropped their eggs on purpose just to get out of that situation.  Well, why not fuck where they started?  Right.  Like, why walk 70 miles to fuck?  Fuck at the beginning.  Because they go back that way.  And then they're like, and then the women are going to go back this way.  The women penguins to get the food.  Well, why not fuck there if that's where you're going to want? 
[00:36:00]  If that's where the food is.  If step one is walk 70 miles, step two is fuck.  Step three is walk 70 miles to get food.  Fuck where the food is, you fucking retarded penguin fuck.  Fuck you, you fucking shit fucker.  Cocksucker, Tiger Woods.  He loves his satellite radio.  Holy shit.  And then we went to see The Aristocrats, and it was like the best movie I saw in five years.  I love The Aristocrats.  Loved it.  Saw it Friday.  Last Friday.  Jimmy's growing hair.  That freaks me out.  Yeah.  Coming off. 
[00:36:30]  I just wanted to be in L.A.  I was trying to do some auditions and stuff.  Oh, pilot season.  You grew your hair?  The WB has shown interest.  They're branching out to the whites.  You were on the WB.  How'd you pull that one off for five years?  Yeah.  I have no idea.  Were you on WB?  A long time.  Hey, can we talk about the time when we all had breakfast together and I went to the bathroom  and you opened up way too much to Nick?  What were we talking about? 
[00:37:00]  When we were all...  What statement hotel did we always have breakfast in?  Park and Meridian.  It was my favorite breakfast place in Manhattan.  Ben came back and said...  With that wig guy.  Yeah, the guy with that helmet.  We love that guy.  With the hair helmet?  We love him.  Bring in the mail.  Bring in the mail.  Oh, my God.  Bring in the mail.  You've got to explain that.  Jay shows up.  He walks down the stadium stairs and we all run over to say hi.  And Anthony wouldn't move from his position.  Anthony's in the back with a cap on.  I'm reading instant feedback.  I'm still working on the...  God forbid we get more than a minute as a break during the show. 
[00:37:30]  If we had two minutes, I perhaps would have gotten up and greeted Jay.  And then Jay just points from afar and just points at it and just goes, bring in the  mail.  Bring in the mail.  The bag is to be held at a 45 degree angle.  Bring in the mail.  And if any of this process...  So get back to the Park and Meridian because Ben came back to the office and said, you should  have been there.  I mean, Jimmy was opening up.  You were opening up.  Who else was there?  Well, Jimmy's got this great game where he looks at the waiters like he has a crush on 
[00:38:00]  them and they're all old wig wearing queens.  And oh, I didn't even tell you this, Jimmy.  We went back and the guy, not the wiggy, not the stormtrooper wig man, and not the other  guy, the guy that's kind of in the middle looks sort of regular and like heavy set from  like maybe Egypt.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That you do it a lot to.  The middle is your guy.  The one you really make eyes at.  The one who I kind of like, actually.  I go, hey, where's our friend Jimmy?  He goes, I don't know.  And I go, he really loves you.  And he goes, I love him. 
[00:38:30]  Oh.  I swear to God.  It's reciprocal.  He goes, I love him.  Then he like blushed and he walked away.  Big understudy ship him hog.  He tripped over his warden from Midnight Express cock.  Just want to put his head on a fucking coat hanger and sneak out.  Billy Hayes, you would have sucked a cock.  Bring William Hayes.  All right, we're going to get into what you guys discussed in a few minutes here.  Okay.  Well, we got to talk to Steve Drew.  Steve Drew, one of the motocross guys that was just out there practicing.  Sneaky bear. 
[00:39:00]  He's got big hands on this guy.  This guy was ripping it up and practicing.  What do you think, Steve?  It's pretty amazing out there, man.  I mean, you know, this is like for guys who ride supermoto throughout the year, like myself on the National Series.  It's like Disneyland on a supermoto bike out here.  You know, you're doing stuff that you never thought you'd be doing on a motorcycle.  You know, this goddamn thing up here.  Yeah, we were talking about this one-up that starts at the top of the stadium.  Yeah, it's very interesting, and it's a very new thing for supermoto bikes, for sure.  I mean, you've got the first 60 feet to a vert wall that you've got to step up to, and then you better hope that you don't overshoot it, 
[00:39:30]  because if you overshoot it, you're going to slam it in the next takeoff.  Or if you whiskey throttle it, you're going to end up down here at the bottom of the stadium in front of everybody on your head, you know.  So it's pretty amazing.  What's a whiskey throttle?  Well, that's when you get a little lazy on the gas, and that thing goes wide open, and you're not ready to let go.  What's it like knowing in six months you're going to be married to Pink?  Really?  Well, cool. 
[00:40:00]  How about, like, Corey Hart?  How could he marry that beast?  I don't know.  He married her?  No, they're engaged, right?  That's his problem, man.  You've got to deal with that.  Do you get, like, are there motocross groupies?  Of course there are.  Well, you know, I mean, hopefully my girlfriend isn't listening, but, yeah, I mean, you know, I guess everybody's got some.  Nobody listens.  No one listens to this.  You're on the film file.  Can I tell you guys I picked a nose hair today?  I heard that guy say that.  Since you've been riding, have you fallen at all?  Oh, yes. 
[00:40:30]  I just actually, two months ago, had a plate put in about nine inches long in my shoulder,  and I had to go race about two weeks later at the first national.  So, you know, we're about 100%.  I'm hysterical about you guys.  You talk about the injury, and it's like, yeah, and then next week.  Scars, scars, scars, scars, scars.  A week later.  Wow, we're looking at the score.  Oh, that's a good one.  At first, I was like, what's he showing us?  That runs from the shoulder down his collarbone all the way. 
[00:41:00]  Those are bolts right there.  That's got bolts coming up.  Make believe this is Mickey Carcass.  Wow.  That's great.  I can't stop looking at his abs.  I know.  Hairless, too.  Jay, Nikki's loving that scar.  She's good.  I am.  You're loving that one, right?  I am.  Can you feel the bolts in there?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't touch it.  Yeah, feel it.  I ain't gone.  Don't be a wussy.  Put on some rubber gloves and get near them.  I won't be touching that.  Ant's a real germaphobe.  Oh, is he?  Yeah.  Where do you put the glove on before you grab a doorknob and stuff? 
[00:41:30]  People have a misconception that I'm a germaphobe.  His A.Z. body.  That's awesome.  His A.Z. body.  Sorry I'm not a fat fucking radio asshole like 99% of the rest of them.  Jesus Christ.  He's a germaphobe, though.  He has to put on a glove before he jerks me off.  You know how uncomfortable that is?  That is a very dirty Johnson you have there, Jimmy.  God, man.  This is way better than regular Rambi.  Of course it is.  Jesus.  People think I'm a germaphobe.  Where are you from, Drew?  I'm a disgusting adult.  Actually, originally from Semaculate, California. 
[00:42:00]  Really?  Yeah.  You're a local guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pretty much.  Pretty much.  You have a giant Jimmy.  Look at the size of his hands.  And imagine him running around your neck as you masturbate.  He's just calling me a fat out of shape boy.  Lazy boy.  Steve, what's the craziest thing you're going to try to do today?  Well, you know, I'm not, I mean, basically, I'm not a freestyle guy.  I do all the supermoto stuff.  Okay.  So we're just racing around the track, you know.  Craziest thing to try to win. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, pretty much.  You know, you've got the best guys in the world here, you know.  I mean, you've got Jeremy McGrath, Chad Reed, I mean, Jeff Ward.  I mean.  You ever try to take someone out on purpose?  Well, you know, not necessarily purpose, but I guess there's paybacks, you know.  Somebody does something to you, and you always remember that.  And, you know, you could always go a little bit more aggressive into a turn, and, you know,  maybe there might be a little bumping and grinding going on.  And if he doesn't get up, you're not going to cry over it, that's for sure, you know.  Chad Reed's gay, you know.  Oh, really?  Chad Reed. 
[00:43:00]  Chad Reed?  Yeah.  Well, I'm dropping a big secret bombshell now?  Chad?  It's fucking, it's Chad Reed.  So is Robert Reed.  He's standing behind me, isn't he?  Yeah.  They get sick, and they go to see Dwayne.  Dwayne Reed, Jimmy.  Pharmacy giver.  When do you actually race, compete?  Our race starts 1.30 on Sunday.  We've got another practice session day from 3 to 4, and then we get a seating session tomorrow  for an hour and a half to get our start pick.  What are you trying to do there in practice? 
[00:43:30]  Like, what's your goal practicing?  It seems like you would kind of be good at what you're doing anyway.  Well, that's true.  What are you practicing?  That's true, but every track differs, you know.  I mean, this bike setup, you want to, you know, change some stuff.  I mean, not every time you go to a track, your bike's the same all the time.  Like Robbie Knievel.  Yeah, pretty much, you know.  Just a bike.  Yeah.  Do you think he's a douchebag, Robbie Knievel?  Well, you know, he doesn't come off as much like his dad used to, you know what I mean?  So, I don't know.  I wish his dad meant it.  Yeah, but that thing is.  Just hop on some factory bike and fly over something.  The thing is, is the guy doesn't jump with style, you know. 
[00:44:00]  No.  He jumps like he's, like, hanging on for dear life, you know.  I mean, these freestyle guys jump a hell of a lot better than he does, you know.  And they're bigger daredevils than he is.  He jumps like he's Christian.  Yeah.  Do you find it disconcerting that on the Home Depot scoreboard they keep showing people crashing all day?  Yeah, you know, you don't want to really look at that stuff.  That is kind of people.  Oh, my nut.  People do tune in and want to see that, which is awful for the guys that are competing.  I never do. 
[00:44:30]  For sure.  You never do.  No, I actually don't.  This is the sport where I actually love watching the guys.  Their vert ramps are insane.  Oh, yeah.  The freestyle stuff is crazy, too.  I mean, even when they complete it, it looks like they're wrecking.  I mean, these guys are all making dough off of stuff that we used to get in trouble for when we were kids, you know.  We were a troublemaker if you skateboarded when you were a kid and rode your bicycle and went and did all that stuff, you know.  Now, these guys are heroes, you know what I mean.  They're making a good living doing what they love to do.  You ever try any freestyle stuff in your own spare time, like just fucking around?  No, you know, not on a motorcycle bike, you know. 
[00:45:00]  A little crazy.  Well, you know, it always sucked because I'd always get hurt and I couldn't show up to the race next weekend.  Yeah.  So, I had to put that to the wayside, you know.  But, you know, now we just go fast on the pavement and the dirt, you know.  And that's, believe me, that's crazy enough, you know, especially when you've got chain link fences.  And they've got a freaking planter out here that we're going over at about 80 miles an hour, you know.  So, it's pretty interesting.  You're on pavement out there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you do with tires?  Because I know you would have, like, nobbies.  No, we run a slick tire.  You do?  Yeah.  If you guys check out the bikes later on, it's a slick road race tire. 
[00:45:30]  How does that work for you on the dirt?  You see that?  There's a big blue groove out there.  Yeah.  Well, that groove, if you can get off of it, it sucks.  You stay on that groove and you're all right.  Because it gets compacted down to where it's almost like hard to run or something.  Yeah, it's what they call blue groove.  Because what happens is the tire will start leaving the rubber on it and it actually turns a shade of blue.  So, that's kind of what we call the blue groove.  And that's basically the main line that you want to stay on to get best traction on the dirt, you know.  Hey, Steve, when you're not racing, you have a real job, they're telling me?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm the working class, man.  Like, there's not many guys that have real jobs at this point, right? 
[00:46:00]  Well, I don't think so.  I think there's a few guys out there in the supermoto because we don't get paid the big bucks.  But, you know, that's what I do.  I've got to work the 50-hour grind.  And I build four-stroke motorcycle pipes for a company called Two Brothers.  And they sponsor my team.  And, you know, I'm able to go and live the dream of going racing and do what I always want to do.  Do they have a website that we can talk about?  Yeah, if you want to go on it.  Brother, this is all about plugs.  By the way, twobrothers.com.  By the way, is it the number two or TWO?  TWO.  Okay, because I have a book out on paperback called Gasping for Airtime that was a bestseller. 
[00:46:30]  It was about when I was on Saturday Night Live and a bunch of Farley.  Like, Farley took a shit out my window.  Like, stories like that.  So it's in paperback now.  So if the pests want to put me on the paperback New York Times bestseller list,  just go out and be fucking animals and buy every copy of Gasping for Airtime.  Now, you were talking about twobrothers.com, right?  Yeah.  T-W-O-B-R-O-S.com.  And if you want Gasping for Airtime, you can go to eatabullet.com.  It's in a package called Trinkets I Own Made from Gorilla Hands. 
[00:47:00]  Feel free to pick it up.  Why do you have to plug so incessantly?  I don't know.  It's all about me.  You were shameless.  As John Candy said in planes, trains, and automobiles, you insensitive ass.  Hey, you guys, do you guys frown or do you guys...  Hold on one second.  Twobrothers.com?  Yeah, T-W-O-B-R-O-S.com.  The best mini stuff on land.  And you, what do you do for them?  I do all the research and development, building on the four-stroke pipes for the big motorcycles.  You say four-stroke against slower for Jimmy? 
[00:47:30]  Do you guys frown on people who, like, ride mopeds, or do you kind of see them as, like, brothers?  Hey, man, anybody...  Anybody that's got the balls to get on a two-week vehicle is cool in my book, man.  Do you ride a bike to get from point A to point B on a daily basis, or...  That's suicide in Orange County, man.  That's suicide.  Look at this.  See?  This guy, he's not a dummy.  Look at this.  He will risk his life out there on that nut-fucking course, but he will not ride a bike on the streets with a maniac.  And that's funny, because I did try to ride a bike to work a few times to beat the traffic, 
[00:48:00]  and I looked in my rear mirror, and I was riding this DRZ 400, and there was, like, this line of bikes behind me,  so I moved over.  About six bikes go by me, and I was like, okay, I'll get behind these guys and see how fast they're going.  Next thing I know, I'm looking, and we're doing 80 miles an hour between cars,  and I'm just thinking about that old lady driving the Delta with blue hair and doesn't see me,  and, like, pulls out, and, wham, oh, you know, I'm a fly on her windshield.  I have the biggest hands I've ever seen since the retarded guy from L.A. Law.  Whoa.  Look at the hands on this guy. 
[00:48:30]  That probably serves him well, around the throttle, brakes, brakes, throttle.  Hey, we got...  I'm sorry, Kenny.  How do you get over the fact...  We'll get over this.  Yeah, we'll get into that in a second.  We got guests.  We got motocross men.  Hold on.  We got a girl on the line that wants to fuck Steve.  Oh, really?  Let's say hi to Viola.  Viola.  Viola.  Sexy name.  Hi, boys.  Viola from Oklahoma.  Yes.  Steve, I just want to say I want to fuck you. 
[00:49:00]  All right.  Fair enough.  Look at all the happy young kids in the audience listening to this.  Well, I think we're going back to the East Coast next month, so...  Oh, there you go.  Give yourself some Viola.  Do you mean him or Steve C?  What happened to Viola?  Viola.  I hung up.  She's gone.  She got hungry.  She just got disconnected.  Yeah.  All right.  We want to thank Steve Drew for stopping by.  Thank you guys very much for having me, man.  Good luck to all.  Appreciate it.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  It's nice to meet all you guys.  It's Sunday, not tomorrow. 
[00:49:30]  Hey, you like those hands, huh?  Sunday.  You must masturbate constantly.  Thank you, sir.  Where do you live in O.C.?  Yeah.  I'm in Huntington.  Steve, you got a...  I lived in Capistrano.  You got a shot of his scar?  Nice to meet you, brother.  All right.  That guy's insane.  Yeah.  That was the sickest scar I've ever seen.  I was going to brag about my little thumb scar.  Oh, stop.  Guy has metal in his shoulder and bolts.  It went from the top of his shoulder down his collarbone right to his chest. 
[00:50:00]  Just a big scar.  It was exactly what the collarbone is.  Yeah, that was it.  Steve, how come everyone that gets a sleeve tattoo winds up putting on fucking Japanese  fish?  There's not a human alive.  That's a toy.  Steve, why don't you get on mic?  Yeah, Mike.  Yeah, Steve.  Mike, Steve.  There he is.  Tell this awful story to the whole country.  I like that mustache, Morgan Spurlock.  Oh, by the way, I want to say hi to all the whack baggers.  Vomit bag, freak eight, tell them Fred, host his cupcake, Philly Jack, and dude, dude, 
[00:50:30]  Brady.  They make me happy every day.  They are a pisser, aren't they?  They're great.  Remember, gasping for airtime, paperback.  Just take it over.  All right, let's say hi to James in Utah.  James wants to say hi to James Ward.  Meeting Lolita and Tehran.  We've got to get that off the fucking...  What?  Go ahead, James.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey, man.  I just want to call and say I've been listening to you guys' show for like about a month or  so here and just do my best to spread the virus out here in fucking Utah. 
[00:51:00]  It's a tough thing, but I'm doing my best for you.  Utah.  Jesus.  Are you a moment?  Don't even give me shit about Utah.  Moment.  Sorry.  I'm a big fan of James Ward.  I just want to call and say hey, and I love the stuff that I'm broadcasting for airtime,  and I've got my hardback, handpaper, bat version, so best of luck with that.  Thank you.  So what grade would you give my book if you had to grade it for everybody?  Oh, God, man.  I gave it at least an A, A minus.  I thought it was one of the funniest shit I've read in a long time. 
[00:51:30]  I laughed through the whole book.  And are you a Mormon, sir?  It's pretty fucking funny.  By the way, that was a brilliant review.  It's one of the funniest shit I have read in my life.  I read that.  Jimmy, the guy gave it an A, Jimmy.  Save it for Owen Gleiberman.  That's one of the funniest fucking shits.  Hey, are you a Mormon?  No, thank God I'm not.  CRQ's over 40.  I like the Mormon.  I got a Mormon Ben's talk joke for you.  All right, go ahead.  Okay.  Is this from Drew Carey's book?  Ben's talk so big, the Mormon's going to start a mission there. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  Or give me a train wreck or a car wreck.  We need that.  We need that.  Yes!  I wish I had that fucking sound with me.  You have no idea.  In life.  I'll say things to her, like, before bed, and just go,  It brings him such joy.  Can I just hear her, like, again?  Of course.  Oh, God.  My son likes it, too.  He goes, What was that?  It's always, always fun to car crash, people.  Very good.  All right.  Bring in the milk.  Bring in the milk. 
[00:52:30]  So, is it true when you woke up?  Well, we'll tell about that later.  So, can we talk about when Jimmy was left alone with Cox?  Yeah, sure.  And you've opened up for me.  Jimmy, what are you doing?  Yeah, Jimmy.  Oh, my God.  What is it?  What happened?  I don't know.  It's not good.  I pulled this out.  As opposed to good?  As opposed to good?  Hey, Steve, could you put your filthy Lebanese hands on this and fix it?  Jimmy cannot figure out his headphones.  I don't know. 
[00:53:00]  What do you need to figure out?  Oh, the plug pulled out.  Al Michaels can do it.  You're pawing at it.  I'm killing Oak today.  Stop pawing at it.  All right.  Just shove it in.  We got it fixed?  There you go, Jimmy.  You did get shorter when you lost your weight, by the way.  Thank you.  I thought he was an animal until he started losing the weight.  We thought he was like 6'6'' back at WNEW.  He was a big dude.  Now he just looked like a young Burt Young.  That might have been funny if I didn't say young and then Burt Young.  Asshole. 
[00:53:30]  Youthful.  There you go.  All right.  Can we get back into this?  You guys opening up too much at the Park Marine?  It was after our quarrel.  That was the day we went to our...  Yeah, yeah.  That was an ugly guy, yeah.  So I go...  Jimmy's got great stories.  Well, like, he wants to get peed on and all that stuff.  Like, you'll be fascinated by Jimmy.  He's actually, like, a really good guy.  So then I get up to go to the bathroom.  I go, just start talking to him.  And then, uh...  Excuse me.  I wasn't there, so...  It was sweet. 
[00:54:00]  What did we talk about?  I don't even remember.  Just about everything.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  It was endearing.  Monster Rain and whatnot.  Oh, wow.  She asked what Monster Rain was, so I explained it.  But then you kept going and going.  About Will, Jimmy Norton.  About all of it.  Well, when someone...  Helen, Jimmy Robinson, Helen.  I was trying to catch her up on things we've talked about on this show.  Because when somebody...  When a beautiful girl sits down and says, well, tell me how you sucked a cock when you were  young.  You feel obligated to explain other things after.  So it's not the last thing they hear.  Yeah.  And then, we didn't come at that age.  We were too young.  Let's wait for Jay. 
[00:54:30]  Gasping for airtime is available in paperback at every bookstore in the country.  I'm giving you an assignment.  All right.  He told you about his pleasure, the golden showers.  Oh, I heard it all.  And I thought no less of him.  No, I hope not.  Because you must have told her Monster Rain.  Because I think you asked me to explain Monster Rain.  Yeah.  Well, he said explain Monster Rain to her.  And then he walks away.  And then he was like, well, you're not going to explain it.  I wasn't there. 
[00:55:00]  No, I mean, it wasn't inappropriate.  It was just bizarre.  That's all.  That's how we'd never met.  Well, I probably wouldn't have went in that direction if Jay hadn't said...  Right, right.  When someone says explain Monster Rain, it's kind of hard to go into, like, you know, like  white political discussion after that.  Witty banter.  Yeah, exactly.  If you wear the sunglasses, you can just see the twitch.  You can just see his eyebrows peek up over the top of the sunglasses.  He's twitching pretty good right now.  A little nervous blink behind the glasses.  All right.  And Jimmy Robinson, of course.  And how he hated Jimmy North.  Yeah, Helen, I forgot about for many years. 
[00:55:30]  And I just remembered later.  Helen?  Yeah.  He had imaginary friends, for those of you listening.  That's right.  And what was Jimmy Robinson, who was made with a cape?  Was Jimmy with a cape.  And they both hated Jimmy North.  Jimmy hated him.  But it was him.  I don't understand how that works.  And then Helen, like every boy's friend, was a middle-aged woman with a beehive hairdo.  Yeah.  A frosted beehive hairdo.  That's who every boy should have as an imaginary pal.  Of course.  A chum.  Helen.  With at least a natural kid's name, Helen.  Would she discipline you, or would she be very loving and cuddling? 
[00:56:00]  I don't remember.  I think we would just talk.  Yeah, you would just talk.  Yeah.  Like a guidance counselor or something.  Yeah, just discussing things with Helen.  You are a weirdo.  It's called an asshole.  And then that guy came over.  I thought he was fucking smuggling a wok on his head.  That was in the fucking Park of Meridian.  That's the worst, worst rug we've ever seen.  Can I eat potato salad out of your wig, mister?  It's a hat.  It really is a hat.  Oh, my God.  Hello, Arthur.  Nice day.  All right. 
[00:56:30]  Why don't we step aside?  But real fast, that waiter, by the way, loved Gasping for Airtime, available in the  favorite box at every bookstore.  And you can get it at Amazon.com.  You can go to jmorelive.com.  Meetabullet.com, Cleveland, Odeon, both shows are sold out.  Don't bother.  No, the second show didn't sell out.  We came close.  I want to say on the air right now, me and Nikki Cox are challenging Rich Ross and Bonnie  McFarlane to a stand-up battle.  A choke-off.  Oh.  Wow.  I know she doesn't do stand-up, but I think we'll be all right.  Neither does Ross. 
[00:57:00]  God, that's something we could promote.  That would be...  I think I'm dodging her.  I'm dodging her.  You want to buy a dryer store?  Did you see the...  Did you wash?  No, dryer would be the logical one.  It's wash-a-machine store.  Wash-a-machine store.  How about we eat sushi and church on Tuesday?  Did you see the picture of Boss and the monkey on Whack Bag?  He goes, I owe this monkey five bucks on a box.  Did you see that picture?  No, I haven't seen that one yet.  We were commenting on Jimmy's calves, how they photoshopped penguins into his calves 
[00:57:30]  because his calves are shaped like little penguins.  I have relatively good calves.  Must be a one.  Beautiful calves.  March of the Penguins.  Great movie.  You should have good calves.  You're in good shape.  March of the Penguins sucked my cock.  Great movie.  My seven and three quarters beautiful fucking...  You got seven and three quarters?  Yeah.  Nice.  I've never been more happy than sitting next to you.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, but that's nothing compared to Tyson.  Did you read the paper yesterday?  Fourteen.  Fourteen inch.  He's black.  What the fuck is he?  Of course.  Fourteen inch. 
[00:58:00]  And he's doing a porno with Jenna Jameson.  But he's got bad credit, so fuck him.  What's your girth like?  I don't know.  Ask her.  I don't know.  Does he have good girth?  Perfect.  Good.  Oh.  All right.  How do you think I'm here?  Give me any crickets.  We're going to take a break, regroup.  And it's Jay Moore.  It's Nicky Cox.  That's wonderful.  And we're broadcasting live at the X Games Home Depot Center.  And we'll return.  Stay there.  It's Hopi and Anthony live from ESPN's X Games 11 on High Voltage XM 202. 
[00:58:30]  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus.  Wow.  You rule, Bernie.  Bernie.  No.  No.  This one, right?  It's just, um.  Oh.  What are you?  You motherfucker.  Tony.  Oh, he's coming over.  Oh, Bernie.  Bernie, sit down.  Sit down.  Oh, my God.  Wait.  He's really mad.  He's mad.  You pissed off, Bernie.  All right.  Get over there.  Get over there. 
[00:59:00]  It's getting hot in here.  It's getting hot in here.  It's getting real hot in here.  Bernie, you don't have to take that.  You don't have to take that, Bernie.  All right.  Sit down.  Stand up to your right, Bernie.  Sit down, Bernie.  Sit down.  It's OK.  It's OK.  It's OK.  Oh, it's OK.  It's OK.  Oh, it's OK.  Oh, it's OK.  Oh, it's OK.  All right.  Have Bernie sit down.  Let's see.  Let's go calm down.  It's all right.  Oh.  Oh.  I don't need to get that fucking CD. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, yeah.  Hand over that fucking CD.  Oh, you got to have another.  You lunatic.  All right, Bernie.  Bernie.  Oh, he's fine, folks.  Oh, he's fine.  You tell him to relax.  Yeah, everyone just relax.  Everybody relax.  All he did was take the CD out.  Yeah.  Fuck you.  Keep your CD.  I won't be here again.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie's leaving.  Oh, man.  All right.  He's walking out. 
[01:00:00]  Wow, man.  Holy shit.  Wow.  That was legendary.  That was the rage.  That was what happened on that train.  Oh, my God.  I'm not even kidding.  That was what happened on that train.  We saw it.  He was out of his mind.  You know what's odd?  We were talking about Rain Man, and when you were watching Rain Man, remember, it was  kind of like you look at Dustin Hoffman and go, it's not too bad.  He's a little kooky and stuff, but he seems nice and sweet.  And then that time he lost it at the airport.  Oh, yeah.  Just like, ah!  Just lost his mind.  That's what we saw.  That snapped.  That was right now. 
[01:00:30]  You just threw his CD.  It was like a Pop-Tart in the toaster and a little smoke built up, and he couldn't handle  it.  Right.  Imagine that, though.  You didn't see it coming.  No.  It came out of nowhere.  He just lost it.  Fuck you.  Keep your CD.  Keep your CD.  Fuck you.  And take this with you.  Have another.  Keep your CD.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, they know I'm freaks.  That's the name of the game.  That's the name of the game.  Yes.  We're broadcasting live from the X Games.  Home Depot Center outside Los Angeles, California.  Yeah.  We've got long breaks, Jimmy.  This is the Opie and Anthony program, and  they have started pedaling.  The BMXers are out there pedaling. 
[01:01:30]  I didn't hear them.  I know.  What a drag, because we're trying to get some cool sounds in the background, and  they're just pedaling away, practicing, Anthony.  See, I'm kind of glad the motos aren't out there right now.  Why?  It's a little distracting to talk over when they come around a couple of those turns.  But it was so powerful.  Powerful.  It took, how long have we been on?  About an hour or so, and Poe has broken the cooler.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He's trying to finesse something in there and blasted the side of the cooler out.  Oh, well.  Poe broke the cooler. 
[01:02:00]  It's hot as shit.  Give it a karate chop.  And we're under this tent, so.  And we got Jay Moore, our good, good friend.  A very faithful, dedicated friend.  Absolutely.  Friend of the show.  One of the best.  Am I on?  One of the good ones.  You're on.  You're on.  Cox just pointed out to me, the Mountain Dew ad says, drink up, throw down, but they  capitalize different letters, so it looks like throw up.  That isn't a good ad.  See it right there in front of you?  That's probably not a good. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, all right.  Throw up.  All right, we're going to get some more guests on the show in a while.  Gasping for airtime is available on paperback, ladies and gentlemen, as well as hardcover  at all your bookstores.  Go out.  Purchase.  You've got to see the hotel we're staying at, Jay.  A lot of porn.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, now we're going to come off sounding like primadonnas again.  Well, you're allowed to, you big shots.  Oh, we're big shots.  Bring in the milk.  Why?  We're getting outrageous because we want to shower without having water up to our knees. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, my God.  You're just sharing a room and sharing into a fish tank.  No, we're not sharing a room.  No, I'm sure the rooms are similar.  Your problem is your drain doesn't drain.  No.  Mine is the shower nozzle doesn't stop dripping over the night.  And, uh, we were just, we were looking for something in the line of a meme hotel.  Oh, there's me.  We're in the milk.  What happened?  What is that?  I think it's a call.  I'm hearing a rebroadcast of the, uh, call. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, I think somebody pushed the button by accident.  Okay.  Someone got the phones on?  Way to go, fucko.  Why isn't Bubba the Love Sponge on the fucko list?  No, he's on the fucko list.  He's on fucko.  He's the worst.  I'll show you the list later, Jay.  Okay.  All right.  So, anyway.  So, what's the name of this hotel next door?  Well...  What's the name of the one next door?  I don't want to...  Write it down for me.  I kind of wanted a hotel that's kind of like, um, I don't know.  You ever stay at the Mondrian out there? 
[01:04:00]  Yes.  That's very nice.  I would like that.  Something like that.  I was hoping for a two-star hotel.  A two-star?  Are you saying?  But the Mondrian would have been an hour, an hour commute for you.  I wasn't saying the Mondrian.  I was saying a hotel equal to that.  Maybe a hotel that's not...  That's that, sure.  Maybe a hotel that's not next to an oil refinery.  Well, the...  That's how it goes here, pal.  Whatever that is, what is that thing that's next to the hotel?  And we're really smart because it's part of a yacht club and we're all eating fish.  Because we're looking at an oil refinery. 
[01:04:30]  This refinery, I don't know what it is.  There's five stacks.  Yeah?  And what they've tried to do is put a big mural.  The mural has to be about 100 yards high by about 8,000 yards wide to try to cover up a refinery.  You know how big a refinery is?  And they put this mural there.  Like, you won't notice the stacks poking out of the nice painted whales with smoke coming out of it.  And Kenny noticed yesterday while we were eating that all the silverware in the restaurant is magnetic. 
[01:05:00]  He touched the knife to the fork and it stuck and he held it up with a fork.  But the refinery, something going on, it's some kind of power refining plant, is magnetizing all the metal in the area.  Yeah.  This cannot be good.  And we're eating tuna and salmon.  Yeah.  He ate the fish.  Nice mercury levels.  And my rotted blueberries.  That place should be firebombed.  What a shithouse.  My blueberry had a beard. 
[01:05:30]  They brought him his fish and had three tails.  And the guy was just saying, look how much extra meat you get.  Don't complain.  I went to the zoo yesterday and they served us lunch.  And you're just sitting there eating hamburgers in front of animals like, hey, let's keep a nice attitude, pal.  It's very bizarre to eat meat at the zoo.  The zoo.  Well, Jimmy tried to then have blueberries.  And they brought him a big bowl of blueberries and there was fuzz.  Jimmy said one needed a shave. 
[01:06:00]  He had to shave his blueberries.  It looked like Sea Everett Coop if he choked to death.  I hate that shithouse and I hated my blueberries.  And so I showed a savage who served them to me.  Was he savage?  Of course he was.  Was he a white guy?  No, he was.  He was just a little darker.  And then he was Irish, I think.  And then the lady come over, the manager, and she goes, do you want fresh ones?  No, twat.  How about some more that are going to make me throw up into my bowl?  That would be nice.  Another bowl of rotted fruit.  He didn't get the fresh ones because you knew what they were going to do.  Go back, take his rotted ones, and have some guy pick them out. 
[01:06:30]  Some guy who was putting together suicide bombing belts 20 minutes ago was going to be rifling through my blueberries trying to pick out the ones that need a robe and tissues.  I'm amazed that you say savages.  I rent a place in Orange County, and there are more Asians than anything ever.  It's the most fat.  I'll jog along the ocean, and they're out there three at a time with their long-sleeved white shirts, and they're like poker visors with the green tints. 
[01:07:00]  It's like, why the fuck do you buy real estate in Orange County if you're going to walk around with your hands behind your back and dress like that?  Yeah, a lot of Asians on the West Coast here.  Amazing.  Well, at least our hotel has a nice pool, so.  Yeah, it's really cool.  It's nice.  Excellent.  We all went out to laugh at the pool yesterday.  Say that again without spitting your Brazilian aids all over me.  You know what?  That pool needs a fucking swizzle stick thrown into it.  I've never seen a smaller pool.  It stinks.  You have to take turns swimming.  It's so small. 
[01:07:30]  It was really, really small.  What's bigger, the pool or the book Gasping for Airtime?  The pool.  Soft cover?  Yeah.  The pool.  The pool.  The pool.  But then they had a spa, so that was good.  I have so many questions for you guys about the origin of the spa.  Robert Reed could have done laps in that pool.  That's how small it was today.  I actually jumped in and did 4,500 laps in an hour.  That pool eats my ass.  You wish.  Brutal, dude.  The whole fucking hotel just stinks. 
[01:08:00]  It was right when we pulled up, too.  We had looked at pictures on the website.  It looked luxurious.  And then it was like a painted Motel 8.  Jesus.  What are you showing Jimmy there?  On the cover of the New York Times.  A bed baby.  Oh, God.  That is awful.  Sticking out of a woman's back.  Is that a dead baby?  I wish.  What do you die of?  There's starvation going on.  What do you die of?  It's a picture of an African child.  What do you think?  Starvation.  Oh, all right.  His chute didn't open.  That's a lovely picture on the cover. 
[01:08:30]  And I like the fact that this kid looks like he's in Brooklyn with his hands down his pants.  Look at the fucking thug.  He's waiting to take the sneakers off the dead one.  There's plenty of children there for some reason.  There's plenty of time to fuck.  How about you pick up something and try farming?  Stop fucking and till the land a little, would you?  Farming a little try.  It works.  They wear...  I'm trying to figure out what clothes...  They wear, like, our rejected beach clothes.  When you go to, like, Kosovo, they wear, like, 1980, like, members-only and Chess King sweaters. 
[01:09:00]  Like, everything's completely modern.  Like, there's normal hotels and the guy behind the counters dressed like the fucking dad on Give Me a Break.  Do you mean Dolph Sweet?  Yes, I do.  Oh, wow.  Also in The Wanderers.  Yes, please.  Who doesn't love...  Drop the bowling ball on the guy's hand.  Who doesn't love Dolph Sweet?  Dolph Sweet.  He knows Dolph Sweet.  Everyone does.  It's a fucking mania.  Are you guys watching Celebrity Fit Club?  I love Celebrity Fit Club.  How about Takara, that big, black, fatty? 
[01:09:30]  She's 200 pounds.  How about when they go, this is the new thing that we're completely sick of, is, like, and I'm going to go get his white ass.  Oh, really?  Like, that enrages me.  Yeah.  That enrages me.  From now on, every public appearance I make, I'm going to go, so I go up to Cuba Gooding Jr., and I say to his black ass, like, just say that all the time.  I think you'd be in trouble.  With who?  The blacks?  I think so.  What are they going to do?  I live in a gated spot.  What are they going to come and get me?  Are they going to climb the gate? 
[01:10:00]  It's electric.  They'll get shot like Daisy the Chimp at the L.A. Zoo.  Hey, we've got to say hi to Ryan Nyquist.  Now we've got a real rider right there.  There we go.  What's up, Ryan?  How's it going, guys?  What's up, Ryan?  Were you out there yet?  Oh, yeah, man.  I'm sweating like crazy.  Yeah?  It's hot out there already.  It's going to be fuming hot later on.  You're doing BMX freestyle, right?  Yeah, doing the dirt jumps and the parkour.  He's got the Morgan Spurlock, the edge, pop tour.  That's crazy.  That's the second time I heard.  Who's Morgan Spurlock?  I don't even know who he is.  He's the guy that did Super Size Me.  Oh, okay. 
[01:10:30]  He's got a really cool show called 30 Days.  Yeah, he must be a handsome dude.  Super handsome.  There he goes.  And if I had a dollar for every time she screamed on Morgan, oh, did you bring that to him?  How many dollars is that?  It's Freeman.  Very good, Jimmy.  He wasn't going to let that one get away.  Very funny.  Who narrated that bullshit March of the Penguins?  Gotta love March of the Penguins.  And then the penguin decided to drive Miss Daisy.  Did you see the penguin movie?  I haven't.  It sucks my cock.  Really?  Those guys look so cute, though. 
[01:11:00]  I'd like to say the penguin never got raped.  Well, old Andy Schoel had himself in a fix.  But Jessica Candy would only boss around the back of the penguin.  The front of the penguin she's nice to.  I got nothing after that.  So what's going on?  Do you live here?  No, I live in North Carolina.  North Takalaka and Compton.  Where are you staying when you're here?  Downtown, L.A.  Really?  Yeah.  The Holiday Inn by the Staples Center? 
[01:11:30]  No.  Right by the Hyatt.  Or the Sheraton.  That's where the baseball players stay.  Where are you staying?  Oh, the Sheraton?  Yeah.  Oh, that's nice.  And when someone comes in to play the Dodgers, they roll into there.  So I can get steroids if I need it.  Yeah, dude.  A lot of people say we're bad interviewers.  I don't agree with that.  This guy's one of the best riders.  And we're like, so, how's the hotel accommodation?  Well, you ever crash?  What else are you going to ask him?  That's why you guys are good.  You ask off the beaten path.  Why don't you just look at him and scream phenomenal seven times? 
[01:12:00]  Fucking twitchy fester faggot.  A lot of faggot.  We've got to play that going into break.  Tell the guys back in New York.  Ryan, what are you going to be trying to do today, man?  Yeah, just today we've got to practice.  I'm going to try to get my act together.  I've got two events tomorrow.  I'm going to go in one day, so I'm going to be just crazy.  Two events?  Yeah.  It's going to be narrowly.  Just in the morning.  You ride your bikes?  Yeah.  Ride the bikes.  Ride the bikes?  Yeah.  Ride the bikes.  What was that with, like, freestyle and, like, super alt-vert? 
[01:12:30]  No.  Latte with Splenda?  No, no, no.  Unfortunately not.  Just, uh, there you go.  He just started making out with his kick.  Yeah, while we're on the road.  That was not a make-out.  No, it was a peck.  I liked your joke, Kiss.  It was a nice peck.  Uh, you know what?  I'm going to start all over again.  This isn't my fucking show.  You say something.  How are the groupies, man?  We saw some really smoking girls when we were coming in, and they were not for us.  You guys get, like, a lot of chicks?  There's a lot of girls out there, and they come out for the X-Men, especially. 
[01:13:00]  I mean, L.A., it's just, there's always phenomenal-looking girls in L.A., so it's, you know,  it's just a no-brainer, really.  You come here, and there's going to be girls, but I don't really tend to mix up with them  too much, you know.  It's just drama.  It's trouble.  That's a problem.  Right.  I think so.  Not if you pay.  Not if you pay, but I've never, I've never done that, but I guess, you know.  Oh, dude, an experience over there.  It's fantastic.  There's nothing better.  Yeah.  Even if it's not a girl, it's like, ah, you give her the money, she goes.  Yeah.  We all make mistakes.  He-shee.  Jimmy likes he-shee a lot. 
[01:13:30]  I don't like them, but, you know, it's like, I was wondering why you were wearing a  Laker jersey and blonde wig, but I said Laker jersey.  The Laker jersey.  Why would it be a Laker jersey?  Is that the female team here?  Just because it's yellow, and on that skin, it would just stand out.  What?  He just-  He gets a little scared.  I'm nervous.  What's your move, man?  What's your special take?  He's not going anywhere.  Yeah, we have to go back to Jennifer's life.  Why would a transvestite wear a Laker jersey?  I wouldn't deal with a transvestite. 
[01:14:00]  I'm talking about transsexuals.  I'm not gay.  But what kind of skin does a transsexual have?  Smooth.  All right, let's talk to him.  He's smooth.  He's getting red over there.  He's getting embarrassed.  I want to know what his move is.  Yeah.  What's your move?  My move?  I don't know, man.  I got a lot of them, to be honest.  I got a couple of them.  You got one that you don't quite got down yet?  Yeah, I got a couple of those, too.  That's the big point one, though, right?  Yeah, it tends to be.  I mean, just, you know, they obviously like to see the new stuff, so you try to break it out.  But there's a couple of things I've been working on before this, and I'm not sure  if I'm going to be able to do it or not. 
[01:14:30]  Do you, what do you wear, a cup or something?  No.  You got to protect it.  No, honestly, most of the time, you don't really hit the boys.  You usually hit it in your ass.  Yeah?  Because I know growing up on a bike, it was always a constant danger that you were going  to hit it.  Not as dangerous as hitting the knee on the middle part.  Yeah, that sucks, too.  Knees to the stem.  Pedals to the shin.  Everything.  There's so much, you know, like, when you crash.  Sounds like master pose class.  How many balls have you broken?  Knees to the stem.  I've only fractured my foot.  That's it, huh?  A couple of surgeries with ligaments and stuff like that, but nothing really matters. 
[01:15:00]  I actually have a foot injury, too.  Really?  Which is depressing.  Really?  He gets it, like, doing a man's thing, like, fucking, you know, athletes, and I heard  it slipping, running to turn the porn off the VCR, because someone's coming in and they  might recognize it's not quite the porn I should be watching.  I slip running to a DVD player.  Slip on what, though?  Exactly.  His own juices.  Slip on the milk.  Ryan, tell us something you're going to try, man.  720.  Yeah, I'd like to do a 720 with a barstin. 
[01:15:30]  It's just, like, two full rotations while spinning the bars.  You should do a 720 with a barstin in barstow.  In barstow.  I haven't had much sleep.  With a handlebar stash.  What's a 720?  Fucking zero.  Two full rotations.  When you spin, like, it's 360 degrees plus 360 degrees.  While you're in the air?  The bike's going around, and he's spinning the handlebars, too.  Yeah.  So those things are spinning.  Do you read a lot when you're on the road?  Yeah.  Have you ever read Gasping for Airtime?  Two Years in the Trenches of Saturday Night Live with Jay Moore?  No, I haven't.  It's my LA Times bestseller. 
[01:16:00]  It's about being on Saturday Night Live and suffering from panic disorder.  Ooh.  A lot of Farley stories.  A lot of good Nirvana stories.  Really?  I think you'd really love it.  All right.  I'll take it out.  So what are you doing these days?  Hanging out.  Doing XM radio.  Are you sponsored by T-Mobile?  Yeah.  Did you ever meet Catherine Zeta-Jones?  I haven't.  Did she come by and rub her a box on your face?  No, no, unfortunately not.  And you used to put a load on that tracheotomy scar she has?  Jesus.  You are ruthless, man.  You are ruthless.  That's a legitimate question.  Yes. 
[01:16:30]  She's got a tracheotomy scar that did the airbrush out of all her photos.  It's in her contract.  How did she get that?  Really?  How did she get it?  Michael Douglas stabbed her with a car key when she wouldn't listen.  He said, my father is about to die.  How dare you?  Blah.  I just thought he was overrated.  I just said that Eric really enjoyed it.  Don't say Eric ever.  Oh, that is ruthless.  So, T-Mobile is great.  Who else sponsors you?  Let's give some love.  Do you have a website?  No, I don't. 
[01:17:00]  You've got to get one of those websites.  Thanks for coming by.  I don't know.  Thanks for your time.  We're out of time, actually.  Thanks for stopping by.  Horrible.  No, I got horror bikes, Adidas shoes, T-Mobile, Napster, Thor.  Nice.  Bellsports.  What type of Adidas?  You rock the shell toe, brother?  No, man.  That was another good for riding.  They're good for styling, not for good for riding.  I'm running the four, man.  What are you doing tonight?  Chilling.  I've got to compete tomorrow, so I'm in bed.  Well, a bunch of us are going to jerk off on Jimmy's back.  Really?  Yeah. 
[01:17:30]  But sometimes I just paint my face to look like my back.  Sorry you have to hear this homoerotic nonsense.  It's just the worst.  How do you respond to that?  It's just the worst.  This is the best time you've ever had on radio, right?  It's good, man.  I'm glad you had a good time.  Glad you're having a good time.  Jack spoke volumes.  What would you rather be doing right now?  I don't know, man.  I could be riding.  I could be in the southern.  Yeah.  It's all good, though.  Well, go in the heat.  Enjoy yourself in the dirt.  All right.  In the dirty dirt. 
[01:18:00]  Let's thank Ryan Knight, Chris, for stopping by.  Good luck to you.  Good luck tomorrow, man.  Thanks, guys.  I'm betting if we could go to one of those creepy Indian, we don't play 21, we play 22 casinos right now.  I'm putting all my money on Ryan.  You're winning the X Games, my friend.  All right.  And how's it going to be when they have that dreadlocked Rasta black guy interview like he knows anything about motocross bikes?  Oh, Sal?  Sal's like, all right, that was rad.  No, Sal's pretty good, actually.  Sal's pretty good.  Yeah.  Tell you what, if I win that $50,000 first, I'll go buy your $1.99 book. 
[01:18:30]  Wow.  You cocksucker.  Wow.  I hope you hit your nuts on your steering wheel now.  Steering wheel.  Steering wheel.  Yes.  Let me finish.  Hold on.  He's bringing his Saturn in.  I'm going to drive home.  Oh, okay.  That's great.  There you go.  Let me finish, Ryan.  Go for it.  Just don't get hurt, brother.  I don't care what place you come in.  Just don't get injured.  You guys are awesome. 
[01:19:00]  You guys make money riding bikes and doing these awesome tricks that no one would.  Look at me trying to pull it all together.  What's the most cash you ever made from winning?  From winning?  Yeah.  Probably $33,000 from one contest.  But the passive income is phenomenal.  The T-Mobile, the Thor Club.  Yeah, I mean, that's just awesome.  It's definitely rad to have endorsements and stuff that back you like that.  You don't need a day job or anything?  No, I'm good.  No, we had some guy in here who had a day job.  It's amazing, isn't it?  God, loser.  It's like, how good are you that you have a day job? 
[01:19:30]  Do you get recognized a lot?  It's never like Rick Fox is like, whoa, time to lay tile.  See ya.  Hey, do you get recognized a lot?  Just at these kind of events.  Every once in a while, like in a mall or something like that, but not really too often.  The Hannibal, actually, the Hannibal stash is really doing good for the income.  Do they yell, hey, the edge?  Yeah.  What's that?  Do they yell, hey, the edge?  No.  Because the edge had this.  Yeah, no.  You just don't like me for some reason.  No, I don't mind you, man.  Oh, all right, good.  I never met you.  Do you recognize him?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Even with the sunglasses and the wig?  Even with it. 
[01:20:00]  The pubic wig, right?  Absolutely.  If you know what I mean.  All right.  Ryan, thank you so much for stopping by.  No problem.  Good luck, man.  All right, cheers.  If you hit your balls on the steering wheel in the car, we need a phone call.  I'll be looking for you to massage it.  Ryan, nice.  Enough him.  He don't take no shit.  Sean.  Boys, what's up?  What's up, Sean?  Go ahead.  I can barely hear you, man.  What's up?  That's because you're a faggot.  Oh, well, fuck you, Jimmy, no one.  I can't believe it.  Hey, if you guys did it.  Mister, that wasn't me. 
[01:20:30]  That was Jane Moore.  I'm not going to mention the name of the place where you're staying at, but it's in Redondo's  right next to the Wailing Wailing Wall.  Mister, that wasn't me who made that remark.  The Wailing Wall?  That big Wailing Wall, yeah.  Well, you know, you're at that restaurant.  There's the Moldy Blueberries right there.  It's called the Breakwater?  Yes, and it should be called the Breakwind because it stinks.  It's got fish staples at the top of the ceiling with fishing wire made out of wood.  Yeah, we're at that.  All right.  You've described it.  Anything else?  Yes. 
[01:21:00]  The Moldy Doors?  Shut up.  They hide the assortment of drunks that live out on boats.  They come in at that hotel and frequent quarrel every night.  Yeah.  It's definitely a classic good time.  This is a nervous, heavy breathing guy.  Anyway, sugar nipples.  Are you going to be anywhere doing comedy tonight?  May I be at Comedy and Magic Club or something?  All right.  Thanks for calling.  Yeah.  Cheers.  We'll be there.  It's that place with the windows made of glass.  Hey, Chris from Fool.  Chris from Pennsylvania has a really good question.  Chris, go ahead.  Hey, I'd like to know if Ryan wanted to jump Ben's hog. 
[01:21:30]  And you guys are really low.  Jump Ben's hog.  That's what a new competition at the X Games this year.  Ben's hog is the vert ramp.  All right.  A couple friends want to say hi to Jay Moore.  Let's say hi to La Ma.  La Ma.  La Ma cock is on the phone.  Hello, boys.  What's up?  Hi, Bobby.  You fucking.  Hi, JJ.  You junkie.  Hi.  Hey, I just wanted to know, did you guys hear anything about Jay's book coming out in 
[01:22:00]  soft cover?  I haven't heard about this.  We're trying to pull it out of him, but he refuses.  Yeah, exactly.  Soft cover.  Jay, is that coming out in soft cover anytime soon?  Yeah.  Gasping for Airtime is available now in paperback in all bookstores.  Soft cover.  But they bury it in, like, the showbiz section next to, like, how to be a screenplay writer.  Oh, God.  I have that one.  It's terrific.  Yeah, by Sid Croft or whatever.  So, Sid and Marty Croft.  Sid and Nancy.  La Machine, how's your knee? 
[01:22:30]  What happened to his knee?  Oh, it's getting better.  Tours ACL 11 times, lifting his own ball back out of bed.  What?  He asks his doctor.  He goes,  I'm looking at that anadictomy.  What's that?  What's an anadictomy?  Anadictomy.  Anadictomy.  That's a six change.  Yes, I'm looking to get a cock extension.  Where's that button at?  Oh, good Lord.  All right.  All right.  Hey, Jay.  Sounds crispy on these headphones.  Yes, very loud.  All right.  This isn't going anywhere, Lock Machine. 
[01:23:00]  Don't you do it!  Turn it off.  I've got no place else to go.  Okay.  Oh, Lugasa Jr. won an Oscar.  Now he's rolling around Watts with a Newport in his mouth.  Why?  How?  Time out!  What?  I listen to you guys every day.  What did he do, though?  You've got coons on your lawn.  He's having sex with trannies in Brazil without a condom.  He's a walking hiv.  It was a raccoon.  No, no.  It can't happen to me.  And then suddenly I go, Lugasa Jr. smokes Newports, and everyone's like, whoa. 
[01:23:30]  It's an Oscar winner.  I made Lugasa Jr. jokes years ago, Robin.  Years ago, Lugasa Jr. was on here with your hair, Robin.  We had an assault on the media.  Iron Eagle 8 is coming out.  We had an assault on the media in St. Louis, speaking of hoo-hoo, and the guy was wearing  a Howard Stern mask.  Two guys, right?  Two guys were wearing a Howard Stern mask behind the reporter in St. Louis.  Hold a big Opie and Anthony XM sign. 
[01:24:00]  How do you get a Howard Stern mask?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Someone had a magic shop.  Oprah stole my hair, Robin.  That's from Wackbag.  That's not me.  Someone put the two of them on Wackbag together.  Did they sell the mask like that, or did they just buy a scream mask and paint it?  Put a wig on it.  I don't think they...  Nothing?  No.  I don't know where the video is yet, but we're getting reports they had a successful  assault on the media in St. Louis.  Yeah, it was a good one.  It was Ryan and his buddy with the mask on.  It was kind of creepy to check out.  I'm going to have to see it with the sound and see if he's in the lead now. 
[01:24:30]  Second place.  Where is he so far?  Because we have the guy.  Who's in the lead now?  Lion guy still, I think.  The guy in a lion costume decided he was going to get dressed from the reporter.  Really?  Yeah.  He's dressed as a lion.  In Alabama.  Where was it?  Alabama.  Alabama, right?  Alabama.  A veritable hub of news.  Bama.  The guy was hilarious in his lion costume.  I smell food.  It smells delicious.  All right.  Time for a break.  Yeah, let's take a break.  Ask McFerrere time.  Where's the food?  Is it here?  We're going to regroup. 
[01:25:00]  I don't know where that video is.  Did you guys realize if you didn't get off the air, Rich Voss would have won the last  comic standing?  Yes.  Yeah.  Can you imagine the consequences of that?  As opposed to that fan?  Can you imagine being an NBC executive trying to wrap your mind around a Rich Voss sitcom?  Oh, like that fan got his sitcom?  Well, that fan.  Come on.  Every time I tuned in and just had to hear that.  Oh, my mother.  Oh, that.  Why are you doing?  Shut up.  Shut up.  Get something else, please. 
[01:25:30]  I did like the fact, though, that he would graph his laughs when he would listen to it.  He would make graphs because that's the way, like, organically a comedian works.  Yeah, he was like John Nash.  You just make graphs and you go over it, like, word by word.  You know, that's the way you do it.  You do have nice calves, Jimmy.  Thank you.  A lot of people have been telling me that lately.  What's wrong with your foot that you have that weird bandage on?  It's his ankle.  Swollen for a while.  Is that when you went to that cunt of a doctor that made me wait?  What was her name?  Galena, I think.  Galena.  Galena.  She was the worst doctor in the world.  I hate her.  Made him wait for an hour. 
[01:26:00]  Where'd you get that round?  An hour or two hours.  He left because he had a heart appointment.  Yeah.  Because he has AIDS from banging Bobby Kelly's ass while Bobby Kelly's in a transvestite in  Brazil.  Bob wishes he had AIDS.  Bob wishes he had AIDS.  That fat cell he dropped 40 pounds.  I couldn't believe when I saw that.  I broke my monkey knee, dude.  When I saw that video, all I could concentrate was that giant gut jiggling in the sky.  And they got to go walk towards the tour bus because they have to explain, they take out  a map to explain to 911 where they are. 
[01:26:30]  I broke my knee.  Broke my knee, man.  Hold my hand, man.  If you ever touch her again, you're dead.  That's all the money we had, Karen.  We got another rider jumping over the fence here.  Oh, it's Alan Cook.  Right on.  You know Alan Cook, right, Jay?  Alan Cook's the best.  Cook.  Alan, we like you.  Let me see.  I didn't realize he was here.  I'm glad I said nice things about him.  Yeah.  How's it going?  What's up, man?  Hey, funny story.  I actually met you in a gas station in Phoenix, Arizona like six years, seven years ago.  You were drunk that night.  I wasn't drunk.  I was like 17. 
[01:27:00]  Do you have any carp on your, do you have any fish on that tattoo?  No fish, just birds.  So it can be done?  It can be done.  I'm just saying, everybody that gets to sleep has to mix in that stupid Japanese carp on  their arm.  Like this, Persian, zero.  So he's the warden from Hermes, zero.  What's going on?  Walking his two little fat kids to school.  Steve, go ahead.  Defend yourself.  It's a cover-up piece, and that's why it's so big, and that's why it's a koi fish, because 
[01:27:30]  there's two other tattoos under this that you can't see.  Were those fish, too?  First of all, you're shouting.  Yeah, what was a trout and a salmon?  Covered it up with a carp.  What did you cover up?  I covered up a tribal bird that was right here and an atrocious American flag.  I got one when I was 17.  You don't like American anymore?  Yeah, I didn't like that tattoo, though.  Our guest.  Oh, that's right.  We have a guest.  Alan Cook, everyone.  Sorry.  BMX freestyler, right?  Yep.  You got anything in the works for this weekend that you don't know if you're going to be able  to pull it off? 
[01:28:00]  That's every day.  How come no one ever gets up in the air and just takes their cock out?  How would you know?  I've seen it.  Really?  I've seen it.  Live on TV, like X Games, you get up, turn the wheel, and go, blah.  I've never seen it at X Games, but I have seen it before.  I think Corey Nastasio has done runs in his underwear and possibly naked.  I think when you get up in the air, you just take out the hog, and everyone on ESPN is like,  hey-oh.  That'll cost him a couple of points.  Have you read my book, Gasping for Airtime? 
[01:28:30]  I have not.  That's all right.  Can we go back?  So you met Jay Moore at Phoenix at a gas station?  Yeah, it was random.  Was it a rest area?  And he was going, pssst, through a tiny hole, cut in one of the stalls.  Hey, you're Jay Moore.  We were picking up my cousin from the college, and we just seen him, and I was getting some  drinks or something, randomly.  Did you say hi to him or anything?  Yeah, yeah.  I didn't freak out and bug him, but I just said, hey, how's it going?  Was he friendly?  Yeah, nice guy.  You're a nice guy.  I'm always friendly.  I'm always a nice guy to the folks.  What did you have out at the time? 
[01:29:00]  Was it two years ago?  I was Gasping for Airtime, my book about Saturday Night Live.  Of course.  When's that coming out in soft cover?  It's out.  That's coming.  I'll explain it.  Mush lid.  Zero.  Isn't it an egg white texture?  Shut up, stupid.  You rode your bike down the stairs?  Not those stairs, but.  That's easy.  No, I saw his bike down there.  Would you carry the bike?  That's a little odd.  You should have just tore it right down the stairs, right?  Well, you know, you've got to save it for when it counts.  Down the back of the seats over some people's heads.  Do you know Nikki Cox?  Nice.  I don't. 
[01:29:30]  I've never met her, but I know of you, of course.  This is your stepdaughter, Tosh.  How's it going, Tosh?  Nice to meet you.  Tosh is in astronaut school right now.  No, I've got nothing.  I listen and go, really?  Yeah, really.  I almost didn't make it, though.  Security almost didn't let me in with my bike.  Oh, yeah.  Why is that?  I know the feeling.  I'm not sure.  That crack team of security up there that works at the MTA trying to tell me I need credentials.  Holy moly.  And I'm on the phone with Ben going, the northwest entrance, there's fucking four of them.  Walk in a circle.  You tall baby.  Look at him. 
[01:30:00]  Tall baby.  Look at his number.  And right when I said it, I looked over and he's jerking and lurking and all sorts of stuff.  Do you guys do any sports?  Snowboard or rider?  Do any of you?  I like to do Greco-Roman gay wrestling.  Where are you from, first of all?  I'm from the Bay Area.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Well, then this is right up your alley.  No, we do nothing.  We just talk for a little bit.  Opie's a big rollerblader.  He rollerblades to work through Manhattan and battles the taxi cabs.  I don't know if you guys noticed, but that stuff did get kicked out of the X Games.  Why? 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, what happened?  Why?  It was too faggy, probably.  It's whack, yeah.  It's whack.  They had rollerblades and they booted it.  Wait, it means the same thing.  Why did they throw it out of the game?  No one was interested.  Who cared?  It was just too easy.  It's the same reason they threw out freestyle bungee jumping, because nobody cared.  Who cared?  They had freestyle bungee jumping?  I think only the first year of the X Games in 95 they had it.  It's extreme that you just followed Jimmy to Brazil.  Exactly.  Condom schmondom.  Having sex with trannies.  Oh, you've been to the American bar?  No, I was in the Monte Carlo.  You ever been to the Monte Carlo? 
[01:31:00]  No, I haven't.  It's in Rio.  You almost said it.  You wanted to say phenomenal.  A couple years ago.  You held yourself back.  I heard it's terrific.  Fantagious.  Jimmy, have you ever, when you're with the trannies, have you ever just went, ah, this  is the only time I'm really ever going to go below a guy, and it's not even a guy.  No, no, no, no, no.  Jesus, Jay.  What?  Now you have him sucking a hog.  Yeah, Jesus.  Just because he inadvertently patted a wide back one night in his car?  I don't like the way he inadvertently has me stopping.  No, I banged a chick in Brazil twice with no condom. 
[01:31:30]  That's dangerous, I heard.  A hooker.  A hooker.  A hooker in Brazil, not just a chick.  They should have the ex-games in Brazil.  There's Latinx games in Brazil a couple years in a row, so I know what you're talking about.  What part of Brazil?  They were in Rio.  They were like on Copacabana Beach or something like that.  Exactly where we were, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, it's real shady.  Very dangerous place.  They have train surfing as a competition.  A lot of women with Adam's apples.  Decapitated children heads.  But they had the best surgery in the world, allegedly.  I was so paranoid.  There was like 20 chicks I wouldn't hook up with.  I thought they were guys.  I really was nervous about a lot of those girls.  Can't tell.  You missed it. 
[01:32:00]  Hey, can we take your bike for a ride?  If you want, yeah, go ahead.  He's going to ride that.  Can I ride up the hill?  Up the hill.  You're going to fall, but go for it.  You will not be able to.  Why would he fall riding a bike?  You won't even get up that.  You guys already admitted you don't do anything.  It's not as easy as it looks.  You won't be able to ride that.  I'm not saying it's easy.  I have a lot of respect for you guys.  Hey, did you read my article, Jimmy, on the, I'm sorry.  Shit, I'm going to wait until you leave.  Oh, this is, you can say bad words.  Can you do this stuff?  Yeah.  All this stuff is easy for you?  He's going to win the win.  I mean, you know, get used to it.  I'm actually not in this competition this year, but in 2002 I won the dirt contest. 
[01:32:30]  You did?  Yeah.  50 G's back then or what?  Back then I was only 25.  25.  I'll take it.  Bastards.  I hate to break up this interview, but Nicky has a question.  Oh.  Oh.  Will Ben show us his cock?  Oh.  Ah.  No.  Ben.  Oh, please.  Ben, if you had to show anybody your hog, it would be Nicky.  That's like.  Please.  Everyone just stares at his cross.  Don't be shy.  We're all friends.  All right, Ben's got a mic.  Let's see.  It's shriveling by the moment. 
[01:33:00]  The question's been asked.  Down to the size of a Buick now.  Will Ben show Nicky cocks?  Look at Ben walking around putting Altamont together.  Look at him.  Okay.  Ben, she has to see it.  I know, but I'm shy.  I'm shy.  Show it.  Don't be afraid.  No one's going to laugh at it.  Ben apparently has a 14-inch penis.  No, no.  Impressive.  We think it's just one big ball.  Does this do it?  Let me see.  Jesus.  It's like his package down there is big, so we don't know what it is. 
[01:33:30]  Cock balls, whatever.  There's something huge down there.  We haven't quite figured it out yet.  There's this dude from the Midwest whose name is Bobby Big Balls, and I swear to God  his balls are as big as his headphones, each one.  Really?  He gets them out every concert.  He just had them drained, and they're still massive.  Drained?  I swear to God.  I swear to God.  I don't know what his condition is.  I haven't gotten too much detail, but he seriously has to have them drained once every couple  of years.  Why?  I would wear nothing but white spandex with the lining cord out.  Wet.  I don't know what the deal is, but.  He rides a bike for a living? 
[01:34:00]  I don't think he makes money.  Does he drape him over the seat?  Pedals with him.  That's a good question.  How do you pedal?  I don't know.  You're a young dude, right?  How old are you?  I'm 23.  Oh, fantastic.  You got the world by the bulls.  You banging the groupies, or?  No.  No?  You got a chick?  You got a chick, then.  I do have a chick.  What do you guys do?  You all got these girlfriends you're talking about.  I don't know, man.  I'd be riding my bike up and down the hill with Boulevard.  Look at me.  Because you got to understand, I'm a BMXer.  I'm not a motocross.  I'm not a motocross groupies.  You can ask these guys about motocross chicks. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  If you are going to settle down, it's going to be with someone other than, like, Pink,  right?  Probably, yeah.  Come on.  Look.  Yeah, look at this.  All right.  We got a couple more guys coming to the party here.  Brian Deegan and Jerry Stenberg.  I'm going to go pee pee.  Oh, you are?  I'm going to let you guys actually get interviews out, because I'm just an interrupting asshole.  Love the Jay Moore.  No, we're carrying out.  These guys should know I have a paperback book called Gasping for Airtime.  Awesome.  And it's about when I was on Saturday Night Live and about when Chris Farley took a thump 
[01:35:00]  out my window, and there's a lot of good Nirvana stories and stuff, you know, the bands  like you like.  And I'm going to go fuck myself.  You guys are with the best goddamn radio team in the world.  Phillips File.  Where are you going?  There goes Jay Moore for a little while.  It's Jeremy Stenberg and Brian Deegan, right?  Yeah, I'm going to fuck myself, too.  Yeah, why not?  Fuck everyone.  You've got to love the satellite radio, guys.  I love it.  You can say whatever the hell you want.  We've got to start with Brian. 
[01:35:30]  Brian, you pulled out, right?  You got injured?  Yeah.  Actually, yeah.  You got more than just injured.  I pulled out for once, yeah.  I pulled out.  Well, you got injured doing Viva La Bam, right?  Yeah, a couple, under a couple months ago, I crashed at doing Viva La Bam, back flipped,  it was real windy, it came down, handlebars went in my stomach, blew out my kidney, blew  it off the artery, lost four pints of blood, lacerated my spleen, laid there in blood and  guts for about a half hour until the ambulance got there and just toughed it out and made it,  you know.  I've been into surgery, they laid all my organs out and put me back together, and here 
[01:36:00]  I am back on the dirt bike like an idiot.  What are you, one kidney light?  Yeah, one light.  That's right.  That's why I'm doing step-up, man, that's why.  Wait, so you lost your kidney and your spleen?  Yeah, actually, they saved my spleen, they had a new procedure there, and they wrapped  it in some type of miracle wrap and saved it, dude.  Holy shit.  Man, we just don't race on any level.  And then, like, a couple months later, you're ready to go?  Yeah, well, I think so.  I wouldn't even say a couple months.  Yeah, it's under a couple months. 
[01:36:30]  I had to pull out a best trick last night, I just wasn't, you know, for once used my head,  wasn't feeling it, wasn't ready to go back to the hospital if I needed to.  Smart move.  Thank you.  Does it affect you, though?  Are you, like, second-guessing yourself at all now?  Right now, I am.  You know, usually it takes about two or three months until it, you know, my memory loss kicks in.  Have you done the trick that fucked you up?  No.  Actually, yeah, I went back out and back flipped about four weeks after the hospital trip just  to get it out of my head, just to go, hey, you can do it. 
[01:37:00]  It was just, you know, the wind and other circumstances.  How did it work out?  I pulled it, and I was pumped.  It was kind of like my first time getting laid.  Man, that is something to overcome.  That's right.  God damn, I can't imagine.  Did they show your crash on Vivo Man?  You know what?  They didn't, and they weren't even going to show the flip.  I was like, man, come on.  You know, I went up there for a reason to flip, and they showed it real quick.  And I think for legal reasons, they're a little scared that I might be too happy, and so they  didn't show it.  And I was like, hey, man, that's what I do for a living. 
[01:37:30]  I'm not going to show it.  Oh, man, they should have showed it.  Why wouldn't they show that?  That would be more interesting than if it succeeded.  Somebody just wiping out.  I don't know.  Some people think so, and I kind of told them no, because, you know, I want to be kind of  looked at as a professional, not just the Evel Knievel guy who's going to go and crash  for ratings.  Who the fuck's Evel Knievel?  Oh, that old guy.  Have you seen Robbie's show?  Is that not the worst thing ever?  Where he got his ass kicked?  Evel good, but Robbie sucks.  Robbie sucks.  Wait, I blew up.  Larry Lupel.  Hold on, hold on.  I blew off that show.  What do you mean he got his ass kicked in a bar? 
[01:38:00]  He was in, like, Wisconsin or some backwoods country bar, and he went in, and people were  like, who the hell are you, anyway, and knocked him out.  You're taking all the credit.  Yeah, he knocked him out.  It's too classy.  So he had a black eye in two years.  It doesn't help that he walked in with a leather fanny pack on.  So you moto guys have no respect for him whatsoever, right?  Because you're like the, everyone we've had on the show so far is like, Robbie Knievel stinks.  He's making his dad look bad.  Yeah.  Yeah?  His dad was the man.  Anyone who'd jump a Harley over 100 feet with no suspension is the man. 
[01:38:30]  Right.  They were just bikes that he would grab off the rack and take these things out.  Now, Robbie's using, you know, computers and slide rules to figure out his jumps.  His dad was up partying all night with hookers and blowers.  Yeah.  Vegas.  Robbie's a full-on poser.  He just happens to be related.  Yeah.  Leaving broken bone fragments and he still loops out.  Huh, huh, huh.  He's on a bike with suspension and he still loops out.  Yeah.  Which loops out mean?  I don't know.  It's like this.  It's like this.  It's like this.  It's like this. 
[01:39:00]  It's like this.  You'd think someone would have taught him the back brake trick.  Yeah, for sure.  Wow, these guys just have no respect.  I love it.  I absolutely love that.  It's their life, man.  All you guys have girlfriends, because everyone we've talked to so far is not banging groupies.  We're trying to find guys that are, like, banging these fucking young chicks as they walk in.  Actually, Ronnie Feist was supposed to be here.  Yeah, Feist should be here.  He's fucking all the bitches.  Yeah, he was at the Maxim party.  He's claiming he fucked them all, so.  We saw some of the heroes waiting outside the front gate.  Feist is the pimp of the crew.  He's always looking for bitches.  Getting ahead. 
[01:39:30]  Fucking ass.  That was nice.  Making him eat his ass after he's been on the bike all day.  Yeah, yeah.  I love that.  Don't eat my sweaty nuts, you bitch.  Jesus Christ.  You guys are all right, right?  So, who's competing now?  Jeremy, he just won the gold medal last night in best check.  Get out of here.  50 grand, right?  That's right.  Nice.  Plus bonuses.  All right.  He's big balling right now.  He's going to get more diamonds on his watch tomorrow.  That's right.  That's right.  What was the trick?  You pulled off.  Just a back flip whip. 
[01:40:00]  No footer to one-handed lander over the 90-footer.  All the mother pussies wanted to take the big jump out because they wanted to stick  with the ramp, but I said, fuck that.  Yeah.  He hit the big dog.  No one else would flip this.  It's a big dirt gap, which is unheard of.  You only flip ramps because that's a lot easier.  Yeah.  And dirt lifts are always different.  And he went out and hucked it and shut them down.  And usually they like to hand it to certain guys.  You know, I won't say who, but, you know, he shut them down.  He's one of the outsiders kind of poking in here and made it obvious I was the winner. 
[01:40:30]  Right, right.  There's no doubt, right?  That rock.  You're saying those guys they usually want to hand it to because they're, like, a little  better for promotion?  Absolutely.  You know, they sell that Mountain Dew and Taco Bell sponsorship a lot easier than, I'd  say, the dark image of the metal monster.  They don't sit there and talk about chicks licking their sweaty balls.  Yeah, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I'll tell you how they went to bed early and got up and eat.  I'll get a hell of a way to sell tacos.  Eat this, fuck it.  Right. 
[01:41:00]  Damn.  So what do you got for the rest of the X-Game?  Hopefully another fucking metal.  Yeah.  We'll see you tomorrow.  And what event tomorrow?  Freestyle.  A couple of guys really got their bell rung.  Yeah.  It was carnage, man.  Yeah.  Some good crashes.  They love it.  The crowd loves it.  That's what they come for, right?  Fucking head just rag doll.  For once, I got a watch on the sidelines, and I was like, whoa, that's kind of weird.  This vision over here is like, I want to see someone grab.  I want to see him work this out.  I was like, now I see why people come to this damn ball. 
[01:41:30]  That's classic.  What's the story with the high jump?  We were hearing about that.  I'm in that tonight with a few other guys.  McGrath took it last year.  He's the big name supercross guy.  He's going down this year.  He's been taking the king down, supposedly.  So the goal is to jump as high as you can, basically, over the pole.  It was just an event that was made up, like, three or four years ago.  Just entertaining, easy for the crowd to follow.  You know, it's like, oh, this guy went a little higher than this guy.  It's something that's not judged.  And it's not judged, which is good, because that's always a little weird. 
[01:42:00]  It's just straight up.  What's the height?  The height is, last year, it went up to 36 feet, I think.  That was the record.  Which is the record.  36.6 or something, which is pretty damn high to fall out of the sky.  Hell yeah.  Yeah.  You ever, like, have an event that you know you won, and they give it to somebody else,  and you want to spit in the face?  I've had about nine of those this year.  Well, you know it was yours, and they just...  That's been the whole tour.  Yeah.  I'd be getting that monkey off my back last night, so it finally paid off to get a first  place at X.  That's why I got to do something so ridiculous that there's no question.  Well, I have been for this whole year, and I've been getting robbed by all these bitch-ass 
[01:42:30]  judges.  I finally got scored good.  Yeah.  What do you do with your cash?  Spend that shit.  It risks your life every day on a dirt bike.  Oh, look.  Here comes the pimp himself.  Look, he's still got his pussy juice on his lip.  That's the guy.  That's it.  Blood on his fingers.  Ask him about the blood hand, dude.  Ask him about Boston.  He's coming up. 
[01:43:00]  Ask him about his bitches from Jersey.  The chick with the gold teeth.  Look at the smile.  You already see it?  What up?  Dude, they're trashing you, man.  Oh, that's all right, man.  They're hating, man.  No, we're just saying you're the pimp of the group.  That's right.  That's right.  Just...  Ooh.  Dude, what's up with Boston?  What happened in Boston?  Oh, man.  Why are you guys bringing up bullshit?  Come on.  What happened?  What happened in Boston?  Boston, man.  Come on.  See, pretty much...  The bloody Sunday.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:43:30]  Pretty much.  I got misled.  Misled into this little deal.  You had some crime scene sex?  Looked over.  My boy was just killing it.  So he said, what's your deal?  And I just gave him the high-five with the bloody Mary.  He had to figure it was a ciggy break.  Wait, who was having the crime scene sex with the chick?  Oh, man.  Our boy Vance.  Yeah, Vance from Freeride.  And he high-fived you?  No, no.  I put it up.  He was just looked at it.  He's all, what happened? 
[01:44:00]  Okay, now I got it.  You had...  Oh, jeez.  That was blood sport.  You like when the bed looks like...  That's full Van Damme in there.  It's good when the bed looks like the CSI crew.  Makes some sound.  That's how it was.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Yellow tape around the whole bedroom.  Killed it.  Killed that for me.  Hey, bro, introduce yourself.  Because, uh...  What's your name again?  Ronnie Fleiss.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  All right.  Right on.  So they know back home.  Yeah.  Recognized.  Came in.  Yeah, you're like a pimp of the... 
[01:44:30]  $50 cab ride.  From who knows where.  Yeah.  It was pretty sweet, though.  It was worth it.  Definitely worth it.  Grusty nuts.  Pimp of the group, no girlfriend.  Krispy Kremes.  No girlfriend like the rest of the...  Everybody seems to have a chick.  Not me.  So you're banging the groupies.  Yeah, I'm running everything in sight.  That's what I'm talking about.  There you go.  Yeah, there were a couple at the front gate when we walked in.  Perfect.  Send them to the militia pits.  Line them up.  Line them up. 
[01:45:00]  So looking for...  Obviously looking for a victory.  You don't come here to lose.  Who comes here for a medal and pussy?  Yeah, yeah.  Definitely.  I gotta get a medal.  I gotta get a medal.  Medal before pussy.  I definitely need a medal for the wall.  Yeah.  Just missing an X medal.  What do you got going tomorrow?  Tomorrow I got a freestyle.  So two runs.  What's your big move?  My big move...  What's the winner?  What's the one that's going to take it?  Doggy style.  For me, pretty much.  I just need to stick around and have some of these other guys mess up.  Doggy style.  Yeah.  Perkhead in my lap. 
[01:45:30]  Legs up.  Legs up Productions.  It's a new DVD.  Check it.  Push it to the limit.  These guys are what it's all about, man.  Holy shit.  That's what I want to hear.  I don't want to hear the guys that sit down and talk about, yeah, we've got to bed early.  It's about the sport and everything.  It's that these guys are living the life, man.  Yeah, dude.  Staring it up.  Yeah.  Upper lip.  Smelling gum.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He left a little sample.  Finger dip.  For the thumb dip.  He left a little sample on his upper lip. 
[01:46:00]  This guy rocks.  Every time I rot, it just blows in my face.  The whole way up here.  I was like, this is good.  It's going to be a good day.  Aren't you guys supposed to be practicing or something?  Yeah, that's bullshit.  Yeah, that's how I get up first.  Practice for pussies.  I'm personal on the course today.  They clicked me yesterday.  What happened?  They let Pastrana ride on us.  They clipped the militia.  Let everyone else have two practices yesterday.  They don't like you guys. 
[01:46:30]  They knew that we were a big threat, so they only gave us one practice yesterday.  Yep.  Hating on it.  So we said, fuck that.  We're getting two practices today.  What have you guys done that time?  Like, what did you guys do?  I think Twitch ran one of their chicks back in the day or something.  They're just over a whole deal.  Hey, daddy, do it.  Do you see it getting a little commercialized for your liking?  Oh, it's turned into a TV show.  It ain't even a fucking sport no more.  It's all about the TV.  Some bullshit.  A few years back, it was about you guys tearing it up.  Competition, yeah, yeah.  And now it's about who looks better in front of a camera. 
[01:47:00]  Who sucks the most dick?  Yeah.  I mean, it isn't out of the way.  Jimmy, you win.  It is in the real world everywhere.  But, no, we try to keep it real, you know.  Yeah.  That's a thing.  That's good, you know.  I'll put the monkey wrench in the works, man.  That's right.  Very cool.  You need good and evil to make it go around as well.  Look at it.  All right.  Very cool.  Guys, tear it up, man.  All right.  All right.  I made the last part of this.  Yeah.  Well, we're on for another couple hours.  Just stop on by and say hi if you got more dirt on these guys.  For sure. 
[01:47:30]  I got a lot of dirt.  You're lucky I got here late.  Yeah, right.  Some funny shit going down.  That's right.  No netcat over there.  Really?  What do you got on him as we go to break?  Switch?  Yeah.  Nothing.  I got some shit on film.  Nice.  You can pay for your cab ride now.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  We're going to take a quick break.  We'll be back from the Home Depot Center.  So, we'll be able to broadcast live from the X Games.  Stay there.  Do you ever look back? 
[01:48:00]  Again, I know I do.  When you look back on something you feel great about, when you look back on it, you go,  oh, what the fuck was I thinking?  Yeah, I'm still doing that.  I'm still doing that.  I'm with Sabbath stuff.  There's one song, Who Are You?  Phenomenal. 
[01:48:30]  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  You know, there's always got to be one buzzkill in life, and I've got to just really quick address  the post.  A guy named Dan Acolante.  I want to strike him up in his face.  He gave me a trance on Sabbath, where Ozzy created horror with his cringe-inducing vocals.  Ozzy sounded phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal. 
[01:49:00]  Opie and Anthony, live in Los Angeles from ESPN's X Games 11.  Only on XF Satellite Radio.  Oh, like sands through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus.  Anything else for the Zach Wilde interview we want to play?  Anything else?  How about anything at all?  I'm telling you, I'm a bad interviewer.  Anything with Jimmy on it.  Well, there's so much audio.  I don't know if we can get to all of this.  I'm trying to do this.  Howard talks about going with double duty. 
[01:49:30]  He's very respectful towards the Ozzy.  He talks about a prank he pulled in Philly, where he wore a dress with his whole, he brought  his whole group of guys into a mall in Philly.  Group of guys?  Yeah.  Zach loves homo humor.  Yeah, he does.  He lives for gay humor.  Yeah.  He's a big biker.  They love that shit.  By that, you mean the crew.  Yes.  That he's rolling with.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm not going to get out of that one.  They were dressed like biz itches.  All right, let's play the audio from the prank here, all right?  You did something in a dress.  I don't know.  It was fucking... 
[01:50:00]  It was in Philadelphia.  I mean, Kim from YSP was in love with you.  He was telling me that you did something in a dress.  I don't know what it was.  Did you want to get a dress?  Did you do something in a public address?  It was completely uncalled for.  Something in a dress?  Anything in a dress?  Anything in a dress?  Anything with a D in it?  Hum-na.  Hum-na.  Fucking asshole.  Hum-na, hum-na, hum-na, hum-na.  Just so happy to be communicating.  I'm sick.  I love it.  Hum-na, hum-na.  Shuff for the future.  Dude, I knew it, too.  I fucking knew this was going to happen.  No!  It's fine.  It's adorable.  It's not adorable.  It's irritating.  It's like a big clock right behind whoever he's interviewing. 
[01:50:30]  In 10 seconds, you will be kicked off this bus.  Um, when did you start?  You had a guitar?  You had a dress?  You had bought a dress?  Something with a dress?  You're like on the $25,000 pyramid with Zach Wilde.  Something with a dress?  You wore a dress?  You had a dress?  Uh, things guys like a homo do?  Pass.  Pass on.  I gotta hear the beginning of this again.  Move on, ma-ha.  All right, listen again.  You did something with a dress?  I don't know.  It was fucking hard.  It was in Philadelphia.  I mean, Kim from YST was in love with you. 
[01:51:00]  It was telling me that you did something with a dress.  I don't know what it was.  If you want a dating address, you need something with a dress.  It was really good.  Pass.  Pass.  Pass.  Pass.  I don't know if you need the answer.  He said dress like 18 times.  Oh, it's awful.  Something with a dress.  Yes.  That's bad.  Zach, what's your address?  I need something with a dress.  Oh, God.  And hit the bell every time he sends dress.  Ready?  I have a question.  I want to try to hear the rest of you.  You did something with a dress.  I don't know.  It was fucking hard.  It was in Philadelphia.  I mean, Kim from YST was in love with you. 
[01:51:30]  It was telling me that you did something with a dress.  I don't know what it was.  Did you go on stage and a dress?  Did you do something in public with a dress?  It was really, completely uncalled for and hilarious.  He tried to, like, reshape that question every time he started to ask it.  Like, no, that's not the right approach.  Just try this approach.  Oh, fuck that.  Abort.  Abort.  Go to this way.  Go this way.  Somebody else.  Someone else told me about the dress.  No, I knew about the dress.  It was hysterical with the dress.  Women wear dresses sometimes. 
[01:52:00]  Are you a fan of the bird cake?  Oh, it's not fantastic.  We're just smashing your face.  We should have been down there helping out with this whole thing.  You could hear his little heart pounding.  Oh, he's freaking out.  He was.  You kept waiting for them to realize, wait a minute.  You're Jimmy Norton.  Stop.  Go away.  Leave.  Old Jimmy Norton.  Oh, I kept waiting for my professional mask to fall off.  You did something in a dress.  I don't know.  It was fucking hard.  It was in Philadelphia. 
[01:52:30]  I mean, Kim from YST was in love with you.  It was telling me that you did something in a dress.  I don't know what it was.  Did you want a date of dress or did you do something in a public with a dress?  It was really, completely uncalled for and hilarious.  Oh, I'm going to go say uncalled for.  Oh, fuck.  That's going to piss it off.  And hilarious.  Uncalled for.  And hilarious.  Don't hit me.  Don't kick me out.  Don't kick me out.  Yeah, this is my moment.  Don't kick me out, please.  Every question I ask has to have a disclaimer.  Oh, I know.  Believe me.  I love it.  I'm a worm.  I absolutely love it.  It is the cutest interview ever, Jimmy. 
[01:53:00]  Don't you worry about it.  He he.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  And we're back live at the X Games at the Home Depot Center outside Los Angeles, California.  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  The virus is spreading across America.  That might as well have been a regular radio break.  What was that?  Nine minutes?  Ten minutes?  Need a little break to regroup?  About three.  Those last three guys we had on were the real deal, man. 
[01:53:30]  They were animals.  They were absolute animals.  Instant feedback is like, how uncool do you guys feel talking to those guys?  No shit.  Not at all.  Yeah.  They're all, you know, full of piss and vinegar, as they say.  They're going to see me in my Saturn.  Yeah.  Circling 15th Street.  We're bitching about first class, and this guy lost his kidney and half his spleen.  On a bike.  And four weeks later, he's doing the same trick that got him in trouble.  Unbelievable.  Four weeks.  There's only two words for that. 
[01:54:00]  Fuck him.  Jay Moore in the house.  Good point, Jay.  Good point.  With Nikki Cox.  Who is obsessed.  A very nice surprise, by the way.  Who's obsessed with Ben's hug.  I know.  Who isn't?  Who isn't?  Yeah, but I thought if she asked.  Are we going to get this done, you think?  Maybe if you ask, super sweet.  Hold it down.  Ben?  He can't hear you.  He's on his cell phone.  He's on his tiny cell phone.  Talking to guests that don't exist.  He's making a Coke deal.  Ah.  I can't show Nikki my penis. 
[01:54:30]  I'm busy.  I'm on the phone.  No, she wants to see my guy.  Now I'm on a mission.  All right, we'll get Ben on the air in a second.  It's his agent.  Hey, Ben, I got you a Geranimals commercial.  Let's say hi to Hair Tussler from Whack Bag.  Hair Tussler.  Hair Tussler.  What's up?  What's going on?  Hey.  I got someone that's got a system to you.  I hope it works.  Hold on a second.  I can't hear what this guy's...  You got what?  I don't know.  I think he's putting his kid on the phone. 
[01:55:00]  Howard Stern shit dick.  You got that?  What did he say?  Little kids need shit dick.  Hold on.  I'll try one more time.  Oh.  Howard Stern shit dick.  You got that?  Howard Stern shit dick.  Yeah.  Very good.  Yeah, we're getting kids to curse on our show now.  Oh.  Why is this getting so loud now?  Yeah, we're really loud in the headphones.  Ouch.  All right.  Thank you.  No problem.  Oh, that's much...  Now we're way...  Now we're way low.  Now we're way low. 
[01:55:30]  Put it where it was before.  How's that?  Good?  Very good.  All right.  See, Ben is...  Ben's not talking to anyone right now.  You know that, right?  Yeah.  He's just...  Who's on the phone, Ben?  Ben, who are you talking to?  Ben?  Huh?  Ty-law.  Ty-law.  We totally resided.  We need his mic at the office.  He's getting all the sweepers and all that stuff.  Oh, okay.  Ben.  All right.  He's off the phone.  Keep it on. 
[01:56:00]  Ben.  I beg of me.  Please.  All right.  Ben, come on.  I'm sorry.  Show her the hog.  I'll be very nice.  I'll show mine, too, and that way yours will look better.  We can bang them together and laugh.  And I'll be the one in the middle.  Nikki Cox wants to see Ben's hog.  Just show her.  What are you so shy for?  Real quick.  Yeah.  Why not?  Why not?  God gives you such a delicious gift.  Share it.  She's not his type. 
[01:56:30]  Sorry.  No, what the...  Why wouldn't you show it to Nikki Cox?  Are you kidding me?  She was in Niagara Falls.  You don't know her.  All right.  Well, that ain't happening.  Well, that's a way to contribute, Ben.  Yeah, that was great.  Thanks for the help with the radio show today.  Jesus.  Thanks for my directions from PCH coming from Santa Barbara.  Ever hear of the 405?  All right.  We have a crazy story.  Where did we get this?  I don't know where this came from.  Ooh.  Somebody handed it to me.  What are you reading there, Jimmy?  I don't know yet.  Just picked it up.  No, what's that book in your hands? 
[01:57:00]  It's Gasping for Air.  Oh.  Time.  Sorry.  This is like the old days with Jay Moore, where it's Plugfest.  No, I haven't plugged anything ever on this show.  I'm just talking with you.  It came out like two weeks ago.  I just want to see if the Pests can rally.  So on Sunday's calendar section, I can see that paperback best-selling paperback section  and go, ha-ha, they did it.  They did it for me.  All right.  Who do we have here?  Doug Henry?  You look a little like Luke Wilson in the Royal Tenenbaums.  All right.  I've been told that before. 
[01:57:30]  What's up, brother?  Wait.  We've got to get these guys on mics.  Yeah, get some mics.  Jay.  Man, we've been rocking so far, and all of a sudden, this next break just...  The crew.  It just...  I don't know what happened.  Let's get back...  Let's get the energy back.  So we've got Doug Henry.  Doug, say hi.  Hello, everybody.  Hi, Henry.  Doug does Moto X, right?  Super Moto?  Super Moto, yeah.  Very good.  What is that for the newbies out there?  That's when you take a dirt bike and put street bike tires on it and run it on the asphalt.  Probably about 100 miles an hour. 
[01:58:00]  Not super fast, but the thing about it is we slide around and, you know...  That's super fast enough.  Get sideways, and it's pretty fun.  Awesome.  Any injuries?  Yeah, I've had my few.  You know, I came from a motocross background, and, you know, I came up through the ranks learning  the hard way, I guess you'd say.  You can hold that mic if you're going to turn this way out of...  Crashing a little bit, you know...  What made you stop the motocross?  That's the way to learn.  What's that?  What made you guys...  I was just too tough, you know, crashing all the time. 
[01:58:30]  It's like the only way to get faster was to push it harder, and...  Yeah.  I was kind of done with that.  With Super Moto, it's a little bit easier on the body.  It's all new to me.  It's a lot more fun and exciting.  Yeah.  If it sounds exciting.  No, believe me.  To us, forget about it.  The good thing about it is it brings in, like, dirt.  It's something that they started, like, years ago, and they ran dirt bikes on the asphalt  and the dirt, and they wanted to try to see the best all-around rider, and they took motocross 
[01:59:00]  riders, they took flat track riders, they took road racers, and they put them on all-equal  bikes and put them out on this one course to see, once and for all, who was the best motorcycle  rider there was, and it seems like in the past, it seems like when it first started  out, the motocross guys have been doing good, and even in this series now, it seems like  the top few guys are motocross riders, although there are some really fast road race guys now,  but the road race guys are learning how much motocross can help them on the street, so a 
[01:59:30]  lot of the road race guys do motocross for cross training, and it's kind of a good thing,  you know, it just kind of mends us all together, and coming to the X Games, it's just,  it's really, it's good for all of us, because I don't get to see a lot of these guys, because  they're doing their series, we're doing our series.  Yeah, you guys are on the road, but you're not in the same place, obviously.  Yeah, different parts of the country, and we get to, you know, see each other, ride together,  and compete against each other.  Hey, Doug, how much would it cost me to have my name above your name on your shirt, sponsor-wise? 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, he's got one of those sponsored shirts.  Man, how much you got in your pocket right now?  It ain't going to take much.  Zero.  How much would it take?  How many nachos you got left over there?  You're just kind of like a bass fisherman.  Hey, I see you're a married guy.  What does the wife think?  Married man, are you?  Yeah.  What does the wife think?  Oh, she's been with me since I started, so it's...  Is she here?  She's seen, oh yeah, I got a wife, two kids, one of my kids are back home. 
[02:00:30]  How old are your kids?  Back east.  Nine and six.  We're back east, my friend.  Connecticut.  Connecticut.  The city of Connecticut.  The city.  They say on Wackbag, my friend on Wackbag.  Ooh, tell them, Fred.  I don't know, Jay.  It's a long way from home.  Now, what's Luke Wilson doing next year from Tenenbaugh?  That's Chris Fillmore, right?  Why do you have the wrist taped up there?  Oh, there you go, Jay.  We got an injury.  Were you in the Bad News Bears?  No, it was not. 
[02:01:00]  I was chasing Doug last weekend and kind of lost the front end in the high-speed part  of the track, and so it's a little bit, uh, not to say it.  Would it go right to you?  But you're good to go for the X Games?  Oh, it's good to go.  Yeah, aren't you wearing something, though?  Just a little bit of tape.  Did you just scrape through whatever you're wearing, a glove or something?  Yeah, I would ground through the leather glove, and I went right to the phone.  That's the second time in the same spot, too.  Yeah, these guys love their injuries, man.  Is that the worst thing that's happened to you so far? 
[02:01:30]  I don't know.  Actually, last year I crashed at the X Games, dropping into the stadium.  Dropping in?  Dropping in.  That was probably my worst crash.  And what happened there?  Oh, it was just banged up, you know.  Everything was sore for a couple weeks.  Did you roll down that ramp and fall?  Oh, I didn't really roll.  I, you know, made it to the bottom sideways.  Oh, shit.  All a little crossed up, coming down, and then once I hit, it went from the wood ramp to the ground.  Is that embarrassing?  As opposed to good? 
[02:02:00]  You know, I'm not thinking about being embarrassed.  No, but when you see it on film, though, when you see it on film, you're like, ugh.  They didn't show the part in film.  Actually, nobody got it.  I was hoping to see it.  Wow.  But, uh, no, nobody got it.  All they showed was me getting up and kind of sitting on hay bales.  And Chris, you're 18?  I am 18.  He's 18 years old.  You got a girlfriend?  Uh, yes, I do.  Back home in Michigan.  Dude, get out of here, because you could bang any chick on the planet right now.  Jimmy's just staring at him, salivating. 
[02:02:30]  No, no, no.  I don't know.  I bet you have a hairless belly.  That's what it is.  This is XM Radio.  You can say whatever.  Ten years ago, maybe.  You say fuck, poke me in the ass, the mouth, come all over, but no Rostov.  Hey, we got a question for Doug.  It's Gary from New Jersey.  Gary, go ahead.  We got Doug Henry with us today.  Hey, Doug, big fan.  I was wondering, uh, I think one of the Fox videos, that was you who ever shot that one  jump and, uh, broke your back?  Yeah, that was me.  Wait, uh, walk us through that, man.  Uh, yeah, I guess in 95, I just had a, you know, I was chasing for the lead, just another 
[02:03:00]  motocross race, and, uh, I lost control of the bike, and I jumped probably, uh, 220-something  feet or something, and, uh, I just landed, and the impact, uh, just broke my, uh, L1.  It just kind of burst it, just shattered it.  Wow, get out of here.  They put me back together again, and I, uh, came back two years later and broke both my  arms at the same track, and then the following year, I came back and won it. 
[02:03:30]  So, how do you, still on behind me, Jay, you fucking asshole, man.  Sorry, Doug, in the middle of this really, really serious story, the guy's telling us  about all the bones he's broken over the years, Jay, Jay shows us his cock that's dipped in.  He just put nacho cheese on the tip of his.  Anything.  You are awful.  I thought Jimmy would be all over it, like a mouse on a cheese.  God damn, that is hilarious. 
[02:04:00]  No, he's got to walk around with cheese, Dick.  Just to warn you guys, we do a lot of gay stuff, but we're not gay.  Yeah, don't take that off.  You're responding, I'm sorry, man, I can't deal with these guys.  Any press is good press, Doug, any press is good press.  People would be like, let them of you, Doug, who's sponsored dips his dick in cheese.  He's sponsored, for God's sake.  I think if you look at line, uh, 26 on our contract.  Yeah.  Uh, that, that null and void's all-time connection.  Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.  No cohort.  What happened, Jay? 
[02:04:30]  Hey, there's all sorts of crap going on.  What happened?  It's just ain't cheese.  Jim just dipped a chip in the cheese.  I've been eating that.  Oh, my God, he just dipped a chip in the cheese, where I just put the head on my cock.  You're not spoiling this cheese treat for me.  If you're a dick, I don't care.  I want to apologize.  Why are you apologizing?  Hey, look, these guys should know he's a married man with two kids, Jay.  And he needs, look, midget Allman.  I don't look like a midget Allman.  What do you look like then? 
[02:05:00]  Look at that beard.  Little legs.  Tomorrow?  And look at Hanson.  Tomorrow?  No, we actually race on Sunday.  On Sunday?  Sunday.  Well, and we're just practicing then, I guess.  Yeah, today we're just practicing, getting a feel for the track.  Get your bike set up.  Trying to go fast, yeah.  Yeah.  Seeing what we're doing.  What's the fastest you've been on a bike?  I don't know.  Probably 170 on just a street bike.  That's what I mean.  Just pulling around.  170?  Wow.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's lightning.  I honestly just realized this.  You mean there's only practice all day today? 
[02:05:30]  Yes.  I swear to God, I did not realize that.  I'm thinking like they're going to start seating people at like 1 o'clock.  Well, for the Supermoto, there's only practice today.  I think they have the step-up competition later on in the evening.  Yeah.  Yeah, like 7 o'clock tonight.  And he's only 18 years old, and you're already, that's amazing.  Is this your first X game?  Oh, no, you said you crashed last year, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, last year was my first X games experience.  You must have been like, what, six when you first got into it.  Oh, racing?  Like six years old.  Oh, no.  Actually, just three years ago. 
[02:06:00]  Just three years ago you decided to do it?  Got into the Supermoto thing.  You know, we heard about Jeff Ward doing it.  Hello, Moto.  Want to give it a try.  Wow.  Pretty successful for only a couple years.  Yeah, I'm trying.  Tear it up, man.  Who's your biggest sponsor?  Troy Lee Designs and Honda.  Do you have a website?  I don't.  Troy Lee does, though.  You guys should all have websites.  For chicks to email you.  Yeah.  The best.  That's what Jimmy does.  You've got to weed through the fatties.  You've got a few nice ones.  I think I've got the domain name, but I haven't quite yet. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, you've got to hang out to that.  You don't want your name being used for something like this show.  You're going to look like a totem pole in two years.  Believe me.  Look at this kid.  I put my penis in cheese just looking at him.  You are horrible, Jay.  It's a compliment.  He's a good-looking guy.  I'm trying to get Jimmy in.  You know Jay?  You know Jay Murray?  No.  He never met me before.  No?  You ever see Jerry Maguire?  No.  Yeah.  You ever see Jerry Maguire?  Well, the face is familiar, but...  He's a Jerry Maguire.  I just saw it on TBS the other day. 
[02:07:00]  You were cursing and not saying the right words.  I am the Viking Terminator.  Oh, when you guys played a TV game, Bill Murray...  Let me pick that up.  Told me that whenever he has to say effing, he says Viking.  Because he always picks the stupidest thing possible.  Oh, that is pretty stupid.  So, to watch Jerry Maguire, I go,  That's right, because I am the Viking Terminator.  I was watching it on regular TV.  Mr. Fallon?  Yeah.  So, tell us about, like, you guys, you've rehearsed.  Rehearsed?  You're such a showbiz mom.  Rehearsed. 
[02:07:30]  Big smiles, boys.  So, you practice all day, and then, like, you're on the road.  You just go back to the hotel and what?  You email the family.  You call them on the phone.  What do you guys do?  Tear it up at nightlife.  What are you doing?  We watch the other competitions.  I mean, there's so much going on around here.  Those guys are fags.  No, it's pretty neat just seeing all the different stuff out here.  Yeah.  It is very obvious why you have all the sponsors.  You are exactly what they're looking for, my friend.  That's right.  Clean, cut, married, got the kids, and it's like, yes, sir-y-bop. 
[02:08:00]  I know.  Bed check, 10 o'clock.  Are you, like, the best guy here?  One of them.  There's a lot of guys that are fast.  He's the guy, though.  You do 100 miles an hour on pavement?  Doug's the man.  Yep.  Yeah.  I do that in my car every day.  Yeah.  I drive a family sedan.  A couple of new wheels.  What do you do?  What do you, actually, what do you get around on in regular life?  The minivan?  You got the kids?  You got the minivan?  No.  A broom.  No, no, no, no. 
[02:08:30]  I just got a pickup truck, an old beater pickup truck.  I got a farm at home, so I'm just kind of, uh...  You don't ride a bike, though, on the streets?  No.  Crazy, right?  No, my father wouldn't allow it, so I'm not allowed to.  Isn't that amazing?  Everybody that rides bikes in competition knows how stupid it is to ride them on the streets.  You said that you wanted to ride, and you said you're not supposed to, right?  Not supposed to.  Not supposed to.  Not supposed to at all.  See, they should make it more like street, where you're riding out here and have some old  bag and a Dodge Aries K come out of nowhere and just slam into the side.  We have a celebrity door opening. 
[02:09:00]  What's that noise?  All right, we got a lot of phone calls coming in.  Ah, sugar.  Let's say hi to...  We're going to go to Roy in Connecticut.  Go ahead, Roy.  Roy, whatever.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I just want to call and say good luck to Doug.  He's like a hero of mine.  That guy is the toughest guy, bar none you've ever had in your studio.  That guy's been busted up more times than anybody, dude.  He is top as nails.  Doug, how many bones have you broken?  Have you kept track?  No, I haven't.  I don't know.  A few.  Yeah, probably 20 or 30, yeah.  You think Robbie Knievel's cool like the rest of the guys are saying today? 
[02:09:30]  No, no, no, no.  Robbie Knievel's an ass.  Evil.  Evil is the man.  Right.  That guy started it all, man.  Have you guys noticed on Robbie Knievel's show what bitches his entire crew are?  Yeah.  Fighting over nuts and bolts, and this guy's about to jump like 90 buses, and they're like,  look, man, give me my fucking hammer.  And they just argue the whole thing.  They all have to have that.  All those reality shows like that.  He's just in his hotel room snorting heroin, allegedly.  They all have to have their arguments. 
[02:10:00]  See you guys later.  I'm going over to Howard.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jay in Connecticut.  Jay, what's up?  Yo, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey, check it out, man.  About a few years back, Doug won the Nationals, and I'm a good friend with Mike Manning.  Doug, you know Mike, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I know, Mike.  Good.  Man, you had a party in your front yard up in Oxford with the moped races and the big berms?  Holy crap.  I laughed for days.  What was it about, Jay?  What was it about?  Didn't you have that big party when you won the Nationals, and you had all those moped races 
[02:10:30]  in your front yard?  Moped races?  What made it so funny, though?  I did, man.  What made it so funny?  It was hilarious.  It was like a gazillion people drinking, racing moped with freaking big, uh, doing mountain stuff.  Tell them about it.  That sounds irresponsible to me.  Oh, and it was the blast.  It was the friggin' blast, dude.  Guys, complimenting you on your parties, I guess.  Yeah.  Mike, you invited us.  We were supposed to be in the band and play, but, damn, thanks for having it.  It was a good time.  Punch it out.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  He's the guy that would, like, piss on your lawn or something. 
[02:11:00]  You don't want to talk to him.  We have another guy.  We have Jay in Texas.  Go ahead, Jay.  Jay.  Jay, go.  Jay?  Jay's not there.  Where are you?  Chris, dude.  All right, Chris, go.  Hey, who wouldn't eat anything that's been in Nicky Cove?  Good point.  He was saying I should have scooped the cheese off of Jay's helmet.  Yeah.  I don't think Jay heard that.  I can barely hear y'all.  All right.  Yeah, the phones are a little tough today.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  A little hard when you're doing remote. 
[02:11:30]  All right.  Why don't we thank Chris Fillmore and Doug Henry for stopping by.  Good luck to you guys in the next game.  All right.  Thanks for having me.  Best of luck, man.  Thanks.  Are you guys both competing tomorrow?  Sunday.  Sunday.  Sunday.  Right.  We're competing every day.  Sunday counts.  Yeah.  All right.  Get that website up.  The 50 G's.  Make sure you read Gasping for Air Time.  All right.  Thanks, man.  The food has arrived.  The food.  Take it easy, man.  Thank you.  Club Soda Kenny walks us all to the bathroom.  Like, I've never been to a Dodger game before.  Are you going to walk me to the urinal? 
[02:12:00]  I have to protect everybody.  You want to go here?  You want to go to the private one, the VIP?  He takes it very seriously.  There's 10 people in the entire stadium, and he's walking us through the bathroom.  Can I wash the cheese off your dick, Mr. Moore?  There's more people in my car.  I'm dodging her.  Hey, Kenny.  How's things so far?  Any problems out there?  Well, you've got a lot of fans here.  They're all excited to see everyone.  And we're getting the food ready because I know everybody's hungry.  And I just want to compliment you, Guy, how well the show is going. 
[02:12:30]  I'm a fucking idiot.  I just wanted to say...  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  Shut up!  All right.  Thank you, Kenny.  Hey, Kenny.  I'm big and stupid.  There's a difference between an idiot and being big and stupid.  You are big and stupid.  Are we going to the comedy store tonight?  I will take you wherever you want to go.  Yeah.  Improv, where are we going?  Come out of my house. 
[02:13:00]  We'll take the electric boat out and look at who is...  All right.  We're going to go to Jay Moore's house tonight.  Hey, Kenny.  Yes, sir.  How about when you went to show me where the food is and we went into every single luxury  suite in the home depot center?  And then he goes, excuse me, where's the food?  And the guy at the elevator goes, I don't know.  Maybe it's upstairs.  And Kenny goes, come on.  We've got to go upstairs.  And the elevator only has a down button.  On the top floor.  The guy was fucking with you.  I know.  We've got to go upstairs. 
[02:13:30]  When do you do back in the Pacific Northwest to scare campers?  That's what I love about Jay.  That's terrific, isn't it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's terrific.  All right.  All right.  Kenny, thanks for adding nothing once again.  Let's eat.  Let's go to Carolyn in New Jersey.  Carolyn.  Hey, how you doing?  Can you hear me okay?  It's Caroline, Brian.  Caroline.  Caroline.  Who's what the whales are saying?  Carolyn, what's up?  I'm at this morning.  He was talking about your brother's shirt. 
[02:14:00]  He wants his money back, he said.  Why?  Imus doesn't like my brother's t-shirt?  He said they're very cheap.  And then the other guy showed that picture of you when you're holding his hand.  I wasn't holding Imus' hand.  Well, you almost see the hand.  They were calling it gay and all that kind of stuff.  And then the one guy, the bald-headed guy, he called your mom loose.  Oh, jeez.  Do we have the audio of that?  I don't know.  I can hear that.  It was at 7.20 this morning.  I don't know if he used the word whore, but he definitely said loose.  All right. 
[02:14:30]  Well, we got the, I got a lot of email that Imus was talking about us today.  Wow.  Yeah, he definitely was.  All right.  Because we, uh.  Mad about the shirt?  Am I the only guy that has no idea of what Imus is?  Well, he was all thinking.  What he was talking about, he still thinks you're his son.  You're not on.  All right.  Thank you.  We'll get to the bottom of it.  Hello.  All right.  That's Caroline for Jersey.  I can explain, I guess.  Imus was talking about my brother's t-shirts that he's making.  Yeah.  And then he was talking about that, what's that deal that XM made with us?  Audible.  Audible.  Audible.  I guess you go to Audible.com, you can listen to this train wreck of a radio show. 
[02:15:00]  You can download shows onto your iPod and listen to them at your leisure.  And while you're at your computer.  Uh-oh.  All right.  I'm going to guess Opie on that one.  What?  Very good, Jay.  God, he listens every day.  The fart game.  That was fun, right?  The fart game, son.  You played one day.  And we ended with a Jay Moore fart.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  It was a big surprise.  It's a celebrity fart.  There's a celebrity fart at the end.  Am I the only one that has no idea what Imus is saying at any time?  I'm not worried about it.  It's always just some kind of deep voice. 
[02:15:30]  Ah, shut up, stupid.  What are you talking about?  It's a cheap shirt.  Well, we have the audio.  You want to hear what's right?  All right.  Let's hear the i-man.  I don't know if we're going to be able to hear it from this location, but we'll try.  Play the Imus audio from this morning.  ASDAC, down 25 points to 2191.  Even if you do not subscribe to XM Satellite Radio, you will soon be able to hear my boys,  Opie and Anthony.  Anyway.  How's that?  XM has made a deal with audible.com to make O&A available online to their subscribers on 
[02:16:00]  the same day it airs on satellite.  Now, Rob and I got our Opie and Anthony t-shirts, you know, that Opie's brother makes, but he  makes them once you order them and send them money.  But they're crummy t-shirts.  The money up front.  And the month-long subscription to check out O&A on audible.com is going to cost $12.95,  but before we do that, I want my money back on the t-shirt. 
[02:16:30]  The t-shirt sucks.  Though they don't.  Second quarter earnings were flat for Viacom, which will split its...  Oh, why is that amazing, Charles?  No, they just have the...  They put it up on MSN to see that really gay-looking picture of you and the Opie.  You and the Opie, excuse me.  Where you appear to be.  I don't know what.  When did you hear that fire, brother?  Oh, my God.  Well, I was at a book sign.  Oh, oh, oh. 
[02:17:00]  If they lowered the camera, they looked like you were holding hands.  Or whatever.  Or whatever.  Well, I like Opie.  So what am I supposed to say?  Opie, by the way, could very easily be my son.  That feels good for us.  There's some investigation going on now.  I could be Opie's father.  You look like you've got a lazy...  He's a nice kid.  He's a nice kid, and I like him.  You mean that Opie doesn't know who his father is?  His mom was some loose slut back in the day?  Yes. 
[02:17:30]  That must have been really loose.  He must have been drunk out of her body.  Halftime at an Islander game back in the ages.  Wow.  There you have it.  I miss this morning.  That's very funny.  Get dished out, you've got to take it.  I guess he's trying to say that he banged my mom, and that I'm related to Imus.  Yeah, back in the 80s.  In the 80s.  In the 80s.  Well, talking also about how irresponsible and drunk she would have to be to have banged  Imus back then. 
[02:18:00]  That's very funny stuff.  Oh, my God.  And the T-shirts are just fine.  A lot of our fans are wearing them right here at the X Games.  He wants a refund.  Los Angeles, California.  I swear to God, I just thought that was Imus.  Thank you.  I swear to God.  I'm watching this maniac do backflip on a motorcycle, waiting for him to hit his balls.  Imus, for me, is like you're walking.  That's what it is.  It's an easy thing to do.  Oh!  The man goes up in the sky on his motorcycle.  I saw Wedding Crashers.  Yeah.  And now, walking is now doing a parody of himself when he talks. 
[02:18:30]  Of course.  They give me the money.  I stand where I'm supposed to stand and say what I'm supposed to say.  But, these freestyle guys out here, they just kicked up while we were playing the audio  of the iMan.  And, unbelievable, they're mad men.  They're insane.  Doing flips.  Who thought you'd see the day where they're doing flips on motorcycles like this?  Get 50 feet in the air.  On purpose.  Yeah.  And they are just flying. 
[02:19:00]  This one's for Jimmy.  And this is just practice.  You don't have the slightest idea of what you're talking about.  These girls bust their ass.  A non-college educated woman waiting to see me is the only way they can make a living.  That was the guy, Fisk, that we had on Fise?  Yeah.  Which one's Fise?  That was the guy that had the pussy juice on his upper lip, right?  Wasn't that the guy that came in late?  Riffing.  Is that the guy with the silver tooth?  Yeah, that was the guy that kept the pussy juice on his upper lip from last night. 
[02:19:30]  Dude.  So he could smell it while he's in the midair.  Dude, how nerve-wracking is it?  They do their money shot on this last hill, which is really close to us.  And that's the one they're coming up.  They're letting go of the bike.  And it is a little nerve-wracking to watch him hit that dirt mound because they could  end up right here where we're broadcasting from.  Well, what about the camera guy that's at the top of the hill right next to him?  He's going to get...  By the way, Steve's getting a little dirty.  Steve is videotaping everything that's happening today. 
[02:20:00]  So ESPN can sue him for putting it on his website.  Yeah, exactly.  Wow, these tricks are amazing.  And they're just practicing.  He stood on his gas tank and threw his hands in the air and then sat back in midair.  Did a little hands up.  He threw his hands in the air like it was a stick up.  Look at this.  There he goes.  And that was feet in the air.  Holy crap.  First the hands, then the feet, of course.  He'll fly over a jump and then stick his feet straight in the air while holding on to  the grips.  Did we see any flips yet?  Yeah.  I saw two.  The guy's been flipping around like crazy coming off of that first jump.  I keep taking the camera as a motorcycle going to riot to kill us. 
[02:20:30]  The one that's in the sky cam.  I see a tire coming toward you.  Out of the corner of my eye.  I just see that camera.  Over, Johnny.  I'm like, Jimmy, stand up quick.  What?  I still, by the way, cannot get over the fact that you dipped a chip in that cheese.  Who cares?  I would have dipped it on his helmet.  I'm hungry.  Maybe if the food had been here a little sooner, I would have to resort to fucking cock cheese  in my bag.  That is true.  And actually, he didn't get that for the cheese.  I had some on my mouth.  I'm like, could you get that?  Can he help me?  We got the names.  He's a good boy.  We got Maria, right? 
[02:21:00]  Maria knows the names of these tricks.  That should be good for about 30 seconds of the radio.  Holy shit.  No, it's okay.  No, it's all right.  We goof on everything.  What is the one called where they fly over the jump, he's holding on to the grips, but  his legs are straight up in the air?  That's the heart attack.  It is.  It's called the heart attack.  Of course it is.  It's called the heart attack.  What about the backwards flip?  It's just a backflip.  It's just a backflip.  That has no creativity in that.  They got a name like something else. 
[02:21:30]  Well, there's a backflip 360, which is that one right there.  Holy crap.  Did I just see that?  It's called the militia twist.  Yeah.  Did you just see that?  Yeah.  Wow.  And what are some of the other names for the tricks there?  The Lazy Boy, the Knack Knack, the candy bar, the saran wrap, all kinds of different things.  The saran wrap?  Oh, that's where you lay on just the dignity saver.  Oh.  All right.  What's the saran wrap?  They wrap their legs around the handlebars. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, oh.  So that's when you do a jump and they throw Hershey bars at your face.  Oh, there you go.  All right.  We're going to let these guys practice.  We're going to go get...  Holy crap.  That's insanity.  That isn't right at all.  Why don't you spin upside down?  You don't need to do that.  Guy just flipped over right in front of us.  I don't want to be a buzzkill, but this is just not safe.  This is very dangerous.  I think this could be dangerous.  How the hell do you figure that crap out?  How?  A little scared.  Yeah. 
[02:22:30]  Here he comes.  All right.  This is just us watching.  Well, yeah.  It's a little distracting.  But Steve's got video.  He'll throw it up on...  You see the one guy?  He flies over the hill.  He's wearing a cowboy hat, and he makes like he's choking himself.  It's the Jompanie Ramsey.  As soon as you said cowboy hat, one time his helmet fell off, he did the Jane Mansfield.  My God, he lost weight and went near there.  It's the reed.  He's wearing a robe over that jumper.  We have Dale from Arthur Ashe. 
[02:23:00]  We have Dale from Oregon.  That's over the line.  Hey, God.  Yes, it is.  Good evening.  Huh?  How are we doing this evening?  Good.  How are you?  Can you guys hear me okay?  Yeah.  Go ahead, Dale.  Okay.  Hey, I've got a question for Nicky.  I was wondering, I'm a big fan of the show, is there going to be a season two DVD box set  coming out in a new picture?  Absolutely.  They're working on that now, but the problem is with post-production, there were some issues.  Nicky Cox left the show because Ben wouldn't show the hog. 
[02:23:30]  Aw, man.  But yeah, they're doing DVD because we're going to Vegas for the DVD release thing.  All right, Vegas.  Nice.  We're going to step aside, regroup, get some food, and we'll continue.  All righty, we're eating.  It's Open Anthony at the X Games at the Home Depot.  Your money's box.  It's ONA, live from L.A.  With ESPN's X Games 11.  Only on XM.  Like sand through the hourglass.  So is the ONA, Miles. 
[02:24:00]  We loved Eddie, but he was a little slow.  He was like...  A little slow.  A little slow.  It could have been Rosie O'Donnell's brother in that movie that was on the other night.  You know what?  They gave him the job of taking the garbage out.  This was his job.  Take the garbage out.  Dude, you know he can't trash Eddie.  I'm not trashing him.  I'm just kind of telling him, wait, you think he could work on XM radio?  I wouldn't worry about it.  He's not hearing this.  Whenever you give somebody who's a little mentally challenged a job,  they will talk about it to you like it is the most important thing in the world. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, it's very important to them, Anthony.  Very important.  You know, the garbage don't stop.  Every day it's all this garbage.  Garbage, garbage, garbage.  I remember once he was going on vacation and he was very worried that no one would take care of the garbage.  Yeah.  That it was going to pile up.  Like it's going to pile up and Viacom is going to go under.  Who's going to take care of the garbage?  I'm essential to the Viacom effort.  He's still there, probably.  Garbage, garbage.  He's still there.  He lasted a lot longer than we did.  Of course he is.  So go ahead, Anthony.  So that was his job.  I don't know how that translated into giving him the job of delivering the mail. 
[02:25:00]  So you'd go up to your mailbox.  It was like a bunch of little cubby holes in the wall that had everyone's mail in it.  It had your little name tag on it.  And you'd grab your mail out of it and look through it.  And every name that worked at Viacom was in your mailbox except for yours.  And you'd look around.  And remember, our checks would be in there, paychecks.  And like I'd pull it out and go, oh, Earl Douglas.  Great.  I have Earl's paycheck.  And you know it's not going to be that much because he's a black guy. 
[02:25:30]  You could barely get lunch on his paycheck and Earl somewhere is buying a brand new BMW with your paycheck.  So he would just walk around and just, he would just take like four envelopes and shove them in one of the holes, take three of another, shove them in another hole, not paying attention.  And then every so often he'd come in the office and point at someone and go, who's this?  Who's this?  And he'd point at the name. 
[02:26:00]  And if he did that to Ben's day, it said Earl Douglas on it.  Ben would go, oh, yeah, that's Don Geronimo.  And still he couldn't read anyone's name tag, so he would just shove it in.  It would.  And we used to explode.  But we didn't want to, we didn't want to get Eddie in trouble or make him feel bad.  So we could never say it on the air.  Well, the other thing is you were going through a lot of heavy personal shit.  Oh, my God.  And you had a lot of.  I had no address.  My ex-wife was living at my place in Huntington. 
[02:26:30]  So my mailing address was 888 7th Avenue.  It was the NEW building.  That was my mailing address where I got bills and legal things and stuff for my divorce and everything.  So all of a sudden my cell phone gets turned off.  I, and I'm like, where is my, and then I'm thinking, oh, my God, I haven't gotten a phone bill in months.  And I look and apparently Eddie was throwing them away. 
[02:27:00]  I was like, because occasionally he would just throw the mail away.  Got garbage.  Look like garbage.  Garbage, garbage.  Garbage, you know, garbage never stops, guys.  Garbage never stops.  And he would throw them away.  And then we would get these big packages once there were mic flags.  Then we got a big delivery of mic flags, those little cubes with the company logo, the station logo that goes on your microphone.  And we were wondering why it was taking so long to get these things.  We were doing a lot of press at the time. 
[02:27:30]  A lot of TV stations would come in and tape us.  And there was nothing identifying what station we were on on the microphone.  So we ordered a bunch of mic flags.  And every so long we'd be like, where are the mic flags?  We never got them.  It turns out Eddie had received the box and put it in a storage closet without telling anybody.  Just opened up the big, and it was a mechanical closet where the air conditioning units are and stuff.  The big blower furnace units and everything.  And just threw the box in there. 
[02:28:00]  And then the time with the television.  The TVs.  It was like 30 TVs.  30 TVs were coming upstairs.  Oh, yeah.  Another prize thing.  There were prizes or TVs that were going to be used for 1010 Winds, the sister station upstairs.  So they came to the freight elevator downstairs.  And Eddie's in charge of bringing them up.  So wasn't it one of the homeboys?  Yeah, it was the homeboys, and it was the guys in the garage.  And the guys in the garage, one of the homeboys went, hey, Eddie, can I have one of those TVs? 
[02:28:30]  Oh, sure.  Okay.  Okay.  No problem, guys.  Eight TVs missing.  Eight TVs missing.  They came in and just ravaged this retard's television delivery.  It's like, Eddie, where are the TVs?  Oh, a couple guys downstairs took some.  No, you idiot.  It's like it.  Toby and Anthony, the virus is spreading. 
[02:29:00]  All right.  We're live from the X Games, Home Depot Center, trying to shove some food down our faces.  These guys are insane.  Yeah.  Mad men.  Goddamn.  Look at this.  Again, right by us.  Guy isn't even on the bike anymore. 
[02:29:30]  I love that.  The bike comes flying over one of the hills, and the guy isn't even riding it anymore.  He's just barely touching it with his fingertips, and then back on, boom, hits the other part  of the dirt ramp, and off he goes.  Amazing.  How you doing?  I'm doing good.  Yeah.  We got a sound here?  Yeah.  You're on.  It's Eric Foskrum.  Sorry.  We were in the middle of eating.  We had a quick break, so we were trying to...  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  I was trying not to speak, because I didn't know if you guys were on the radio.  I didn't think you were, but... 
[02:30:00]  Oh, don't let that bother you.  All right.  Just chime in whenever you please.  I love the Red Bull hat.  I want one of those.  You do moto, right?  You're going to have to fight me for it.  That's cool.  You do moto, right?  Supermoto, yeah.  Supermoto?  Supermoto.  So you're what?  Speed?  Yeah.  Well, I'm a road race guy.  You are?  I race for Ducati Corsa, and do the domestic superbike championship.  So you look at this stuff we're watching and go like, what are these idiots doing? 
[02:30:30]  It's really impressive down here at ground level, huh?  The bikes go so much higher than it's depicted on television.  When you watch on TV, you really don't realize how high a man and machine are getting above  the ground here.  Yeah, there's no depth perception or something.  Your whole goal is to stay both wheels on the ground at all times.  That's it.  That's what I'm good at.  Yeah.  You don't want any loss of contact.  No.  And that's what you do.  Have you been lucky this year? 
[02:31:00]  We started off real slow, but we've won the last, well, three out of the last five races.  So things are going pretty good for us.  Very good.  How are you doing here?  Good?  We've done one practice session, and I think I was about the second slowest guy on the  track.  Oh, shit.  What do you do about that?  Step it up.  Yeah?  Yourself or the machine or both?  We blew up a motor on the first lap, so that didn't help mentally.  Do you get a little pissed at the crew when that happens?  Hey, you know, it's racing. 
[02:31:30]  Was it your fault?  No.  We got back out there, and things were going okay, actually.  Probably wasn't the second slowest guy, but just struggled to get back into the stadium  here.  That was my problem.  Any big injuries to report?  Like, what was the craziest thing that happened to you?  Because these guys are coming up to the mics and just bragging about, I lost my spleen  or my kidney, and I got bolts where my collarbone used to be.  Anything big? 
[02:32:00]  I got some injuries, but I'd rather not even talk about them, because I have enough.  Yeah.  How long have you been doing it?  I've been professional for 12 years.  12 years now.  Damn.  And did you start out road racing, or were you a moto?  Because a lot of guys started dirt.  Yeah, dirt track.  That's the only way you could really do it as a kid without getting in trouble, is on  the dirt.  And then what made you get into road racing?  Um, dirt track, I've won a dirt track championship in 96 and didn't really have any avenues left 
[02:32:30]  to pursue.  And the road race thing just kind of opened up for me, and I liked it right away.  So it was obvious, and I had a lot of help, and my results were good, and it was easy.  Is it more expensive?  I would think it would be.  The bike's probably a lot more expensive.  But I haven't had to pay for it.  Nice.  Sponsors rule, don't they?  I don't like to ride fast.  I tried it once, but I get scared. 
[02:33:00]  No, no, no.  Be honest with us.  He's a little petrified at the speed.  You ride a bike on the street?  I've been asking a lot of the guys that.  Yeah, yeah.  You do?  I have a 999R, and I ride around on the street.  A lot of the guys say you have to be crazy, and they do this.  They tear it up out here all day, but driving home, they want a little more metal around them.  Well, I don't really care for riding a motorcycle on the freeway, put it that way.  But I definitely enjoy the freedom of riding a bike, so it's my favorite mode of transportation.  Yeah. 
[02:33:30]  Who's your competition out here today?  Well, so far, the moto guys have been just rocking because the track is very much suited  to them.  So I think right now, Jeremy and Doug Henry and Chad Reed, I mean, all the moto guys have  been incredibly fast, and all that average, but the supermoto championship guys and road  race guys, dirt track guys are struggling a bit.  We heard that the moto guys are usually the guys that have a little more of an advantage. 
[02:34:00]  Here for this race.  Yeah.  Why is that?  There's more dirt here, more obstacles, and the road race course is more of a parking lot  than it is actually a road-flowing circuit.  Yeah.  That being said, Doug Henry can get it all done anywhere, anytime.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's great.  Best of luck to you.  When do you race Sunday?  Yeah, we race Sunday at 1.30, and we'll be qualifying tomorrow at about 10. 
[02:34:30]  Very cool.  Good luck.  Pretty cool.  Take it easy.  Thanks for stopping by.  Appreciate it, bro.  Have a good one.  All right, peace.  I'm just trying to shove food down.  Yeah.  Sorry.  You'll let Opie eat.  That's fine.  Sorry about that.  It's pretty cool.  All right.  I couldn't imagine doing what these guys do.  And they're all so laid back, and you know, yeah, you know, I go out there 100 miles an  hour, fair enough.  They have no fear.  I think they don't like talking about their injuries, or he didn't.  Yeah.  I mean, to us, that's cool. 
[02:35:00]  Like, how many bones did you break, you know?  How many are you up to, or what's the craziest thing that's happened to you?  Yeah.  He didn't want to talk about it.  He's probably been asked that about 100 times.  It's also like you think he's 12 years of feminist, you know?  12 years.  Some of the guys who've been in three, four, five years are like, yeah, there's still 12 years  of being asked that question, probably.  He doesn't want to deal with the injuries.  He might have a really embarrassing one.  Like, one time I straightened my helmet all over the concrete.  Maybe he lost his testicle, and he just doesn't want to talk about it.  Ouch.  Right.  In the middle of that interview, I spilled my whole watch on me, too. 
[02:35:30]  You're dead?  So I'm just trying to clean up.  Well, you're conducting a serious interview.  Yeah.  We're just a mess out here in Los Angeles.  All right.  What do we got next?  Someone else is stepping up to the table here.  Is Jimmy eating two burgers at a time?  I'm hungry.  Oh, my goodness.  He's very hungry.  Oh, we got Benny.  Benny Carlson, right?  Yep.  What's up, Benny?  How are you?  Good.  How are you guys?  Very good.  You also do Moto X, right?  Yep.  Very cool.  What are your chances today, you think? 
[02:36:00]  Or actually, when you compete?  Uh-oh.  Chances are as good as anybody.  It's going to be a long race.  It's going to be hour long.  There's pit stops and stuff involved.  How many miles are you guys doing in an hour?  It's going to be 45 laps, so I'm not sure what the mileage or anything like that is.  It's going to be about 45 laps.  It's going to be a long race.  Yeah.  Hi, Benny.  Did I see a tat or some rash?  Yeah, a little bit of rash on you.  That's nothing for you, right?  Yeah.  Last weekend, we had an AMA round, and I was running third and fell down, and that was 
[02:36:30]  it.  So a little bit of road rash.  Pretty much out of it once you fall.  Yeah, you know, because it was a sprint race.  There was only one lap left, and I got hit pretty good, so I kind of laid there for a  bit, and I was a lap down by the end of it.  So you want to get up and get out of the way really quickly, though?  Yeah, I kind of did.  I flew off the track, so it wasn't so bad.  Oh, really?  It wasn't so bad.  One of those moves where the bike lays over and you're just out?  Right.  It was washed out from under you?  Yeah.  What are you thinking when you're just sliding along the pavement?  I think I left the iron on.  Right.  Benny, I'm Jay.  I'm a huge fan of yours, too. 
[02:37:00]  Jay Moore.  The other guys I don't care about, but when you came, I had to sit down.  Yeah, he jumped right back on my huge fan of yours.  Good.  Does anything come across your mind when you're just sliding along like that?  Not really.  When I was doing the road race stuff, it's a bit different where you're going to slide  and things like that, but the supermoto is a bit slower, so you really don't have to  worry about too much.  But the main thing is just getting out of the way so the guys don't run you over.  That's what unfortunately happened to me last week.  Where did he hit you?  Yeah, right in the ribs.  Just nailed me.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:37:30]  And then what do you do?  You just get up and go, ah, walk it off.  Try to, try to.  Did you get x-rays?  No, no.  It ain't that bad.  See, you guys are amazing.  Like, the slightest little thing, it would be, hospital, x-ray me.  These guys, ah, it's nothing.  You guys are just making us look like the biggest wimps today.  All our listeners are emailing, they're doing the instant feedback, just going, you guys  are such faggots compared to these guys.  Well, here's the real question on the table.  If Nikki Cox asked to see your dick, would you take it out?  No.  Come on now.  What? 
[02:38:00]  What?  She's a big Hollywood star.  Huge.  She's very lovely.  Easy on the eyeballs.  Of course she is.  All right.  But no, he's a professional.  He's not going to do that.  Are you married?  Yes.  No, I'm not married.  You got sponsors that make you sit those cushions out?  Yeah.  Of course they do.  Who's your biggest sponsor?  KTM and Generations of Sonoma Lines.  Well, they're all about taking it out.  Yeah.  What do you think KTM's pants were?  Yeah.  Take, take them out.  Oh.  That was pretty good. 
[02:38:30]  That was awful.  I thought of KTM too and I had nothing, so I backed off.  Not today.  I had something.  No, you had nothing and you forged right ahead.  He's three quarters way down the runway, barely at takeoff speed.  These guys are jumping things.  I'm flight 309.  These guys are jumping things.  I'm eating cookies.  What a fat pig.  Oh, that looks delicious.  Look at all the dessert you have in front of me.  I'm only having one more.  You can't eat during the entire interview, by the way.  You care for a cookie, would you?  No, thanks.  Do you take care of yourself?  Do you eat right or anything?  What do you think?  You do?  Yeah, I try. 
[02:39:00]  You don't think that you would need.  No, he's a big fat blonde.  I know, but how old a guy are you?  20.  Yeah.  Hello.  You could eat lard at 20.  And you're in great shape.  6'1".  6'1"?  Thank you.  Do you think you're better than me?  This guy's doing me.  No.  Of course not.  Got a nice big empty stadium to work with.  Do you have to work out?  Because a lot of guys think you're in a machine.  Like, I got a lot of the drivers in NASCAR and Indy and stuff get that a lot.  It's the machine doing the work.  Right. 
[02:39:30]  But you guys are really muscling this thing around.  You've got to be in shape.  Yeah, yeah.  I work pretty much five days a week either riding or riding a road bicycle or something like that.  So there's Jimmy.  Yeah, it's...  I was doing...  Listen to that.  Yeah, it's...  I was doing some cardio, but I injured my foot.  Okay.  So I had to stop.  Good deal.  In 1993.  Yeah, in 1992.  Exactly.  I do the exercise bike, and I put on my iPod, listen to Mark Anthony.  Good deal.  You injured your ankle, and you're not going to work out for two months.  This guy got hit in the ribs by a spike, and the next day...  It didn't even... 
[02:40:00]  Benny, you should hear how he actually injured his foot.  I was watching...  You ever watch a porno, and you realize that they're not the type of girls that you'd want  your friends to know you jerk off to?  And one of your friends walks in, so you run over, and you slip, and you hurt your foot.  Yeah.  And then he walks in and calls you a faggot, and walks out.  So now you have a hurt foot and no friend.  LOL.  Let's eat some more cookies.  Just keep shoving them in, Jim.  Where are you from, Benny?  Wisconsin.  Really?  Yes.  Eau Claire?  No.  West Bend, Wisconsin.  But my family's actually from Eau Claire. 
[02:40:30]  All of them.  I knew it.  I was getting an Eau Claire from you.  He is just the...  Is that where you're from?  All-American guy right there.  You got a girlfriend?  Ooh.  Nope.  Really?  No girlfriend.  Well, take a look around.  I don't know.  Four here.  I'm walking around.  There's four here.  Yeah, take your pick.  Take your pick.  There's four girls in the building.  That's good.  So Sunday, you're racing.  And again, best of luck.  How will I know when I'm watching the X Games Sunday that you're giving me a special signal?  I don't know. 
[02:41:00]  That's right.  What's your trademark move?  I don't have a trademark move.  You don't have a move.  It's just win the goddamn race.  Race, right.  Oh, you race.  That's right.  Yeah.  What about during one of the corners, you lift your leg up and go...  I'll try.  I'll try.  Jay's looking for ball back.  Just one of you guys.  No, that's not where I was going at all.  It's one ball back.  He already thinks Jimmy's master Bennington men.  Not at all.  All right.  Let's thank Benny for stopping by.  Thanks, Benny.  Good luck to you.  Benny, God bless you, man.  Stay healthy. 
[02:41:30]  It's Benny Carlson.  You got a website, Benny?  What's with you guys?  Yeah, you guys all need websites.  Now, are you...  Do you feel that racing is getting better?  I don't want to promote the sponsor.  I want to promote Benny.  I mean, I kind of...  Like, I'm not big on racing.  I never did it myself.  But I remember one time when I was on a moped.  I kind of flipped.  How do you feel about that?  Well, what again?  What's that?  I was...  When I was a boy, I rode a moped.  And I was riding in my friend Paul McKay's parking lot. 
[02:42:00]  And I wound up...  My mirror clipped a car mirror and I fell.  And a gun.  You're pretty manly.  He doesn't even know how to react to something so...  Jimmy, as a boy, why did your friends have parking lots?  Well, I met in my friends, you know, where he lived.  Driveway?  Your friend had a parking lot where he lived?  It's not an apartment, yes.  You live at the Friar Tuck Inn?  Do you just chuckle at people on mopeds?  Yeah.  Mopeds have got to be the silliest goddamn thing on two wheels.  Yeah, they're actually kind of fun. 
[02:42:30]  The team's got a bunch, so we mess around with them.  They do?  You mess around?  You race them?  I heard that the motocross, supercross, and bicycle guys kind of thumbed their noses at  the skateboarders.  I don't know.  I don't.  No, but...  Look, sponsor's wet dream.  Could you answer a fucking question while you're here?  But you do agree, Robbie Knievel is a complete fool, right?  It's all good.  I want to do my best.  I want to do the best for the team.  Just hit the ball.  Catch the ball.  Robbie Knievel's a real fool, right?  What's that?  Evil Knievel's son, Robbie Knievel.  Oh, no, I was saying... 
[02:43:00]  Get out of here.  Everyone else is sad.  Kate's Robbie Knievel thinks he's a complete fool.  Well, it's what you're into.  I don't know.  You are the most diplomatic guy ever.  I want to thank Brian Riggin for stopping by today.  I love the...  No, this guy's right.  You shitty...  How do you feel about the idea that they want to put baskets on the front of most of the  motorcycles?  Ah, you guys are terrible.  Are they awful?  You said you're on a scooter, man.  No, I did when I was a kid.  All right, let's let Benny go.  Bye, Benny.  What's your favorite point, Benny?  Thanks.  Mine's Pool Party at Seymour's. 
[02:43:30]  I prefer Taboo and Taboo 2.  Thanks, man.  Really?  Oh, of course you do.  Ever see Pool Party at Seymour's?  No.  I just remember in Taboo 2 when she's rehearsing the phone call to her husband and she said,  I fucked our son.  Ugh!  Yeah.  Hot.  Terrific.  Not as hot as watching it.  Benny Carson is the all-American guy there, huh?  Here comes Johnny.  Dude.  We got Johnny.  The guy is, like Jay said, what a sponsor of Wafering.  Put yourself first.  All-American. 
[02:44:00]  And watch this.  Yeah.  Ooh.  He just stuck his finger up Hawk's ass.  Better than sticking it in his mouth.  Johnny, what's up, man?  We got Johnny Murphy in the house.  What's happening, guys?  Johnny Murphy, don't mind me eating.  You guys are ripping on my buddy Benny over here.  I look over here.  We didn't rip on Benny at all.  We just asked him questions he didn't want to answer.  He's got a finger in some guy's butt.  It's just the worst radio show you're ever going to be on.  This is it.  Benny, XM202.  We didn't get anything out of Benny at all.  Benny? 
[02:44:30]  Nothing.  Hey, that's not him on the radio.  That's because of him.  He's really the nicest guy.  Dull?  No.  He's just a good kid.  He was raised, unlike the rest of us.  Midwestern, all-American.  Unlike the rest of us here, he was raised right.  Yeah.  Where are you from there, Murph?  I'm from Central Coast, California, like Paso Robles.  Is that like where Sonny Bono was later?  Oh, no.  That was where James Dean crashed.  James Dean crashed?  That was where he crashed right out by us, yeah.  Not as funny as the book, but the video is good on foundrymusic.com. 
[02:45:00]  Did you rehearse already today?  Rehearse.  I'm in showbiz, Benny.  No, you're not Benny.  So you put on your sunstroke.  Wow, I'm confident.  Too much Vicodin.  You don't eat well, do you?  Are you kidding me?  All natural.  Would you like a cookie?  Oh, I'm straight.  I'm all right.  These are delicious.  You've got to watch my diet.  Notice how when he talked to you, Jimmy, he worked in, I'm straight.  As opposed to gay.  Yes, I practiced today.  I went and rode the track this morning. 
[02:45:30]  We had an hour or so on the track.  How's the blue line?  Is that what you call it?  No, it's not the blue line.  Blue groove.  Blue groove.  Well, we called it the blue in Jersey at Raceway Park.  Raceway Park.  Raceway Park.  No, that was what you did on the way in.  You blew a line.  Okay, back that one.  Moving on.  How did it go?  With the blue groove.  It's coming in.  The track's coming in real nice.  I had a problem with the deal at the top of the hill here.  That's a little.  I'm a flat tracker. 
[02:46:00]  I don't know if you guys got that on your info here.  I race flat track, right?  I do some motocross for fun, and I've supermotoed a few times.  This was gnarly.  The first four times, I cased the thing.  I thought, no big deal.  I'll get it right next time.  Caught the rear end.  Flips me over the front end, and I land on the top.  It almost slid down the hill, and I pick my stuff up.  I'm like, man, what a mess.  That's rough.  And so the rest of the session, I rolled the thing.  I didn't even jump it all the way, and so everybody's laughing.  Everybody's going, hey, did you just step up?  I'm like, no.  But you're going to be road racing here, or are you going to take these berms and take them apart? 
[02:46:30]  Oh, I'm more of a, like, corner speed guy.  If I can roll the inside with a lot of corner speed, you know, real smooth, that's kind of my deal.  You're used to that type of racing where your bike is facing the opposite direction that you're turning.  Yeah, full throttle.  Yeah, sideways.  Johnny Murphy, do you have a website that we can plug?  Hey, there you go.  Just my name, johnnymurphy.com.  But it's with two E's, Murphy.  Yeah, R-E-E.  R-E-E at the end there.  Murphree.  Murphree.  That's not what it says on your name tag. 
[02:47:00]  Come on, guy.  Oh, you're right.  I missed it.  I missed it.  Caught them napping.  I wouldn't sweat them, shall we?  There you go.  Keep up the good work, show business.  You got it.  Nice.  Thanks.  That's why we love them.  What's the name of your website?  Just johnnymurphy.com.  JohnnyMurphy with two E's.  R-E-E.  M-U-R-E-E.  M-U-R-P-H-R-E-E.  What do you get on that?  What does a guy like you have on his website?  There's pictures and there's a girl wearing a shirt.  Like, I got shirts for some stuff. 
[02:47:30]  Nice.  She's hot?  She's hot.  I've never met her.  I didn't get to get laid on my website.  I was kind of bummed.  If Nikki Cox asked you to take your penis out with your shoulder.  If it was, what's her name?  Nikki Cox.  Nikki Cox.  If Nikki Cox and I were alone, I'd have my penis out.  She wouldn't have to ask me.  Yeah.  But in a room.  There's the right answer.  In a room with, you know, and she just came up.  Hey, can I see your penis?  I'd have to, you know, come up with something.  If she asked me, I'd take it out in front of a grammar school.  Again.  Even if she didn't ask. 
[02:48:00]  Any big injuries, Johnny?  Yeah, my whole life.  Yeah, how many problems?  No, his whole life is in injuries.  I've never counted.  I've done my neck a couple times.  Just the small compression fractures or whatever.  I've done my jaw before.  That was the worst.  I had to eat through a straw for a month.  My leg.  I got a gnarly scar.  Check out that scar.  Yeah, that looks like a herringbone fish thing.  It's really soft touching.  That's fantastic.  Wow, half his calf is missing.  Jimmy, take your bag out.  You're going to like this one.  Can I see it, mister?  It looks like a fossilized fish. 
[02:48:30]  Thresher shark.  Damn.  Did that hurt?  One bite.  You know, I was really pissed, so I didn't look like planking.  Wait, how did that happen?  I was actually...  Voting.  What's that, a slide?  I was motocrossing, and some guy in the first turn just ran right into my leg and broke  my leg.  I flew off the bike, but the damage was done, you know?  What do you do when you're laying there with a snapped leg?  The guy goes, are you okay?  I go, I broke my fucking leg.  The other guy just picked up his bike and took off.  I was like, oh, man. 
[02:49:00]  Hey, he's got to win the race.  Hey, he's still in it.  How do you think that?  You put, like, some tea tree oil on that?  He's so good in cider.  Cider?  I've got a pen right here.  I've got to get it.  Excuse me.  Whoa, guy.  What?  You just grabbed him for a pen, and your head went right into his lap.  I can't help where he keeps his balls and dick.  He's just the way to the pen.  We're going to make a rating.  Well, after Richie Dole Cunningham over there, he's just the all-American type.  He's just a nice guy.  Well, how do you market the all-American type?  Dole get drunk and bang a hooker and get in a fistfight. 
[02:49:30]  He could have punched me in the face.  We would have been on the front page at the Orange County.  Don't get any ideas.  On the Orange County Registry.  Why am I talking like this, you stuttering fucking prick?  Did you get the guy back from breaking your leg?  Apparently, he caught a bunch of flack from the local bike shop he worked at and stuff.  The last I heard, he had quit and was having a bad day.  It was a racing deal, but the guy was kind of a bonehead.  He was a moron.  What was that guy's name?  I have no idea.  That's a strange name.  You ever run anyone over?  He was in the Midwest. 
[02:50:00]  You ever run anyone over?  They dump and you can't avoid it?  Oh, fully, yeah.  In a racing accident like that, for sure.  Never on purpose have I just boned over something.  But definitely.  Do you feel a little bad?  Oh, I feel horrible.  Really?  You know, the show must go on.  You know, you didn't do it on purpose.  I look over my shoulder and then, wham, wham, wham, wham, you're off again.  That's what they call a racing deal.  You know, it's one of those racing deals.  Hey, I noticed a lot of guys wearing the Malcolm Smith t-shirts.  Is that some kind of sponsor?  It's actually Troy Lee Designs, the guy that I'm riding, the team that I'm riding for today. 
[02:50:30]  This is the shirt.  He put the shirt out.  It's a cool shirt.  That's a bitchin' picture of Malcolm back in the day getting it on, like on a dry lake somewhere,  you know, going really, you can just see speed in the picture.  You know what number he's got on his bike?  Five.  How fast is the racer?  What's the fastest you've gone on a bike?  On a motorcycle?  Not even a race.  Yeah, yeah, never on a racetrack.  Like on the miles, we go like maybe 135, 140, which isn't that fast.  So like on a street bike, you can buy a street bike down at the local bike dealership and go, you know,  180 or something just at the turn of the key. 
[02:51:00]  So my racing speed's not at anything compared to, you know, what you're doing.  I know that.  I'm just saying.  Do you have to open it up on the freeway late at night?  165 or something.  I wasn't really scared.  I'm not in this ride on the street.  It's an uncontrolled environment.  There's too many idiots coming the other way, you know?  I mean, people can be drunk.  I have no idea.  Anthony, we're finding that out.  Most of these guys aren't driving their bikes on the highways.  I mean, it's their job, too.  Huh?  Yeah.  It's their job, too.  You don't want to take your job home with you.  I have a microphone on my way home on my commute. 
[02:51:30]  Hey, Opie, how you doing?  I don't drive home with a mic in front of my face for three hours and say three things.  I just said that.  No, I was saying I said nothing today.  They're hanging around the gymnasium.  Gotcha.  It was all because of this terrible, awful Negro.  He's hitting all the...  I'm looking for the car crash for Jimmy.  The joke doesn't go over this thing.  Mine was misinterpreted, though.  Yes.  Do you get...  I was kind of saying that I hadn't said much this show because I have nothing today.  Well, I got up and left because I talked too much. 
[02:52:00]  Like, I did that on purpose.  Well, you were good.  Well, Jimmy, you were busy last night.  Why don't you tell Johnny what you were up to?  JohnnyMurphy.com.  Here's a chance for Jimmy to contribute to the show.  There's a young lady that I see sexually that I'll normally hand cash to at the end,  like a gift.  And she came over last night, and she said,  Since I'm late, this one's on me, and we had sex from 11.30 until 4.30 in the morning.  Wow.  I popped twice, neither time with a bag, both times inside. 
[02:52:30]  Hoo-ah.  That's cool.  Johnny, it's to you.  Was it the girl from New York Confidential?  No, no, no, no.  I did bang her, but no.  Did you eat her ass?  Wow.  Wait.  She came over and gave you a freebie.  Yeah.  For that long?  Yeah.  You know why?  Because now you're a celebrity.  No, I'm not.  What's her name?  I can't.  I'll tell you off air.  Wait, wait.  Why would she do that?  No offense to you, Jimmy.  Really.  I swear.  No, no.  It's good to hear.  Jim, why would she fuck you without cash?  That's where I was going with it. 
[02:53:00]  Good point.  He said it's to me.  I'm thinking, he's not much.  I mean, I'm not into guys, but if I was, he wouldn't be my kind of guy.  All I'm saying is, Charlie fucking Sheen paid, okay?  That's very hurtful, because I actually, I kind of got some vibes off you.  All I'm saying is, a guy that can have a ship come over that's a pay model, like a prostitute,  come over and do such a good job, he doesn't have to pay at the end.  Hey, high five.  She actually, high five.  That's up this way.  That's the way I do that.  I'm gentle. 
[02:53:30]  He's tired.  He has no energy.  She told you that it was free because she was late?  Yeah.  She just wanted to bang me for free.  Every time I've ever done it, they were late.  I sit there and I take a shower, I look at my window, it'll be about 40 minutes.  And then like three hours later, you know, I'm on QMOV trying to keep it up.  I clean my crack out like four times.  You get the nervous sweats in your crack.  I run in and like open it in the shower real quick.  I try not to look at my watch.  Back in the day, I'm saying.  Who's Kodiak?  You know, back when I was married.  Jay. 
[02:54:00]  This is yours?  Yeah, go ahead.  This stuff will kill you, man.  Really?  As opposed to jumping off a fucking cliff with a biking zero?  He doesn't kill off a cliff.  He just goes fast.  Wow.  You're falling asleep over here, you know.  Me?  Who makes those sunglasses?  Those are cool.  Dragon.  It's the, actually, sponsor about everybody that was just down here, I think.  Who does Jimmy have to blow to get me free sunglasses?  Yes.  Skinny.  He's a super nice guy.  You'll like him.  Send him over.  Jay killed today.  All right. 
[02:54:30]  Dragon sunglasses?  Dragon.  Dragon optics.  And make sure you grab a free XM hat on your way out.  Yeah.  And keychain.  Bottle opener, keychain.  What better way to tell a cop?  Arrest me.  I'm going to have a hard time whispering with this headset on, but on my way in?  Yeah.  Should I?  Yeah, it's okay.  I noticed the pretty girl on the way in.  Oh.  That's a child.  I've made that mistake before.  Jimmy and you are getting closer and closer.  Which one?  The blonde? 
[02:55:00]  The one that was in the way.  Lindsay?  I had the elbow out of the way to get her by.  Oh, yeah.  That's the boss's girlfriend.  Way to go.  Thanks for coming by.  Well, tell me you have to be.  Just because she cuts the top four inches of her pants off doesn't mean you can look at her.  Would you buy those the unfinished rack?  I had to know.  I had to ask.  That's Lindsay, yes.  All right.  Lindsay.  Yeah, right.  Hey, she's mine.  Looking good.  Yes.  All right, Johnny.  They're saying you have to go. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, no!  We've got to let you be.  JohnnyMurfrey.com.  You guys have fun.  Have you ever read Gasping for Airtime?  Two Years in the Trenches of Saturday Night Live?  My book about panic attacks and being on SNL?  No.  Yeah, you should read it.  It's in paperback right now.  It's an LA Times bestseller.  You were on Saturday Night Live?  Two years.  I'm the guy that did the Christopher Walken impression.  Skittles are good for you.  I heard this guy pull something earlier.  Yeah.  He tried something that was not, I recognized it.  Well, I do Imus.  I do Walken.  I do a lot of impersonations.  He has a great Howard.  Yeah. 
[02:56:00]  Do you ever hear his Howard?  Hoo-hoo.  Very good.  Actually, Anthony, your Howard astounds me.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  More of a caricature.  I know.  Well, really?  Yeah.  Let's see the best Christopher.  What do you see the Tiffany do?  Walken.  Yeah.  It's a fair exchange.  You know what?  He did make the effort, so, of course, it has to be rewarded.  Yeah.  He's good at the turns when he takes it at 5.50 and wants to veer off at the oncoming traffic. 
[02:56:30]  It's crazy.  Yeah.  These guys have heard this impression so much that they can't stand it anymore.  That's still very good.  I've moved on to Harvey Keitel, Chris Penn, and I'm working on...  Oh, you want to hear Chris Penn?  I don't care how mad you are at me, that's not half as mad as daddy's going to be at us.  Let's move some cars.  It looks like Sam's fucking hot car lot up there.  Larry, stop pointing that gun at my daddy.  That guy did five years in a federal prison for a crime he didn't commit. 
[02:57:00]  He could have said my fucking daddy's name and walked, but he didn't.  He did his time like a fucking man.  So you're going to tell me that that guy is going to decide out of the fucking booth to rip us off?  Why don't you tell me what really happened, Larry?  What the hell for?  Guy's lump of shit's working for the LAPD.  Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong.  Wow.  That was snagglepussed on the...  That was very good.  Did you know that? 
[02:57:30]  He's a good kid.  Reservoir dog.  He was shot in the gut.  This is what I did last time.  I've got to come up with something new.  It's very good.  Well, Johnny Murphy, thanks, and good luck to you, buddy.  Thank you, guys.  Have a good time out here.  Check out Gasping Firetime at Paperback.  The pests are all buying it up, so you're going to have to hurry.  Yeah.  You go back to the hotel room.  Carson, way to go.  I hope you guys have a good time out here today.  This is going to be a good show.  We ride in another hour, I think.  You're our favorite so far.  You're my favorite.  You're Jimmy's favorite.  I tried to rip on you, and you thought that was okay?  I have a picture of you.  I didn't even notice.  Mister.  We're animals, man. 
[02:58:00]  I dipped the tip of my dick and that cheese over there, and Jimmy took a cracker and  ate it.  You bet I did.  True story, Johnny.  That wasn't much of an effort.  Mister, can I have a picture with you?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Mister.  You were good, man.  Thank you for stopping in.  Best of luck.  Thank you, Johnny.  Okay.  Yo, watch me get in and sunglasses, Dunny.  Don't look bug nice on you, son.  Should we take another break here?  We could take a break.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Definitely.  Send the sunglass man down.  That looks like Jason Lee.  Master poet black eye freckles. 
[02:58:30]  All right, we're going to take a break, and we'll be back.  It's Opie and Anthony live from the X Games at the Home Depot arena or whatever, and we'll  continue.  That's whackpack.com.

He's now a pundit  A pundit  A pundit  For, uh, CNN  He's been there forever  And he was trading barbs with, uh, James Carville 
[03:09:00]  Who was a real tool  Real prick  This, uh, looks like, uh  Bleeding heart liberal  He looks like John  Malkovich  Yeah  Oof, a little bit  With cap teeth  I'm so eager to contribute today  That when he didn't know Malkovich  I almost fucking blew my teeth out  Saying it quickly  Malkovich  Maybe you're tired  From having sex with prostitutes  All night  Dr. Phil says Jimmy  No, I just think that I  Have we hit a wall?  Is this a freshman  No  I think we hit a wall  I was 
[03:09:30]  I was getting excited  I was getting excited  A rookie  About Bob  I hit a wall at 11.05  I was on fire  Then 11.06 rolled around  And it just petered out slowly  Over, over, Johnny  It's alright  Well, we got the, uh  We got the audio of him  Saying bullshit, right?  Yeah  On television?  On CNN?  As he said, he got suspended  On the TV  He got pissed off  Do we have the actual audio  Or the beep?  We don't know  Ah, they said the actual audio  Because it went out live  Derek?  Actual audio?  What happened?  I was setting something up 
[03:10:00]  No, it's the actual audio  Ah  The actual audio  Alright, so we get to hear bullshit  Something we say every day  On, uh, XM  Right  Alright, so what's the setup  On this, eh?  If they were  They were going back and forth  Like you said  Yeah, back and forth  Like they always do  Bob Novak  Is very conservative  Republican  James Carville  Liberal, uh, Democrat  Yep  They're going back and forth  And James Carville  Kinda gives him a jab  And Novak, uh, says  This is bullshit  And then he sits there  I think he started thinking  About what he said  And how bad it looked  And got up and walked off the set  And they suspended him  He knew  Yeah 
[03:10:30]  He walked out  Walked off  As opposed to state  You can't use that type of language  On television  No  I mean, I just  I have my young son in the car  You're not a bad looking man  Mr. Giles  Why don't we hear the audio?  Let's go to that, Derek  We just elected a senator  From Oklahoma  Senator Tom Coburn  Everybody in the establishment  Was against him  She might get elected  In a second  Let me finish  If I'm going to say  James, please  I know you hate to hear me  But you have to see  He's got a show  He's right wingers  And he's got a backbone  You know

He's considered an incumbent  Wow, he got all flustered  He got all flustered  Because he hears the guy  Ripping the mic off  He got all flustered  What it looks like 
[03:11:30]  Is Bob Novak said bullshit  And he's sitting there  And then there was  Kind of a panicked look  On his face  Like, uh-oh  What I said  And then he went  Just let it go  Like he wanted to  Make believe it never happened  And then he sat there  And realized  I better just get up and leave  Why can't they just be honest  Oh, I wasn't supposed to come out  I apologize, everybody  Why can't somebody on television  Just be honest?  You can't  You know why?  Because there's such a fear now  Of saying anything like that  On regular TV  Or even CNN  Just say you're sorry  He did  He apologized  If he offended anybody  In a moment  Just say you're sorry  And move on  It happens 
[03:12:00]  But that's the thing  You can't say I'm sorry  If I offended anyone  You have to say I'm sorry  Period  I'm sorry I said that  Because if you like  I know from  Like if you argue with a woman  And go  I'm really sorry  If I hurt you, Kaylin  Yeah  That's not an apology  No, no  You have to just be sorry  It's a whole other language  With these people  You just gotta be sorry  And end it  I'm sorry I had you  Bring your kid over  And I bounced on my lap  For a half hour naked  No  All right  What's this next one

[03:29:30]  I think he's that  Fucking old man  That's the first Frank  Reference he can yank out  Guy's been on TV  Since 1968  This is like a blooper  A blooper reel  The gag reel  I like it  Alright  That was my favorite part  Of Cannonball Run  When they just show the  Oh at the end  Where they were supposed  To say one thing  But Dom DeLuise  Is blowing a guy  Who's bringing him  His food in the room  You're not supposed  To say that  Your line isn't  You're so young  And Burt Reynolds 
[03:30:00]  Goes to tip his cap  And it's his wig  And some skin comes up  Good day to you  Ow  Gets mad  And punches the  Craft services girl  Right in the face  Alright here we go  With uh  Old Jimmy Norton's bomb  This couldn't be a bomb  You had a Y2K joke  Did you  Huh  I bet you  There were big laughs  They took him out  Probably  In post  You had a Y2K joke  Did you  One of the problems  That they were saying  Was going to happen  Was that the computer  Sisters were going to  Backdate 100 years 
[03:30:30]  Yeah  Because the 01 flip  They would have  Went back to 1901  1900  And I said  That's going to be great  It's going to help me  In my big court case  What are they going to do  Prosecute me for having  Sex with a girl  Who's 114  Yeah  I want more  No  No  No  That was a good one  Wouldn't that make her younger  Well it didn't make  Perfect mathematical sense  Yeah  Because I  Like right when I got that  It's like if she was 14  In the year 2000  Let's say  If it was then 1900 
[03:31:00]  She's not even born yet  Well let's be happy  That you weren't in the audience  Three years I was doing it  Beforehand  You know you're talking  About Y2K  Since you know 1971  Yes they were  Wow  Glad I brought that up  How will it affect  Your Pong game  We'll tell ya  Let's uh  71  Double bomb  Nice  That was a  I piggybacked  On to your bomb bit  My  I was going down in flames  And you decided  Just to get in the cockpit  With me  I was jumping in  Hey it looks toasty  In there  I'm a little hurt 
[03:31:30]  By the way  Anthony has one bomb  And zero flubs  I kind of have two bombs  Though I was a bomb  In that one  Yeah  My Pong joke  Didn't go over very well  I didn't want to  It was overshadowed  By Jimmy's bomb  A little bit  But  Here's uh  Bombs and flubs  Another bomb  Oh  Jimmy Norton again  All right we get it  He's chugling along  Did you get that  Instant feedback  Play keep on chugling  It was from  John F  At yahoo.com  John Fogarty 
[03:32:00]  Of course  I got it  Didn't help  But I got it  Did not help  How do I suck  You know  When you're live  On the air  Like this  You throw them out  And just hope  They connect  And sometimes  They just don't  Jimmy  We all understand  We got to do  Another one  Nervous 
[03:32:30]  Nervous listeners  Is another one  Maybe  Oh yeah  Another one  That go getters  Could take up  Who wants to run  With that one  In that office  Huh  Travis  I've already started  The list myself  Maybe I can hand it off  To one of the other  Oh  Delegating responsibility  Now look at him  One of my inferiors  Maybe  You have  You have  Middle management  Written all over you  Sweet  All right  It's bombs  And flubs  Well we could  We could  Just go to the next one  We'll skip this  What  Why is that  What 
[03:33:00]  There's no skipping  What  There's no skipping  Nathaniel's hard work  What  What happened  I'd rather not skip  I want to hear it  How did you know  It was the gay crew  Just circled  Just circled  St. Vincent's  Just circled  The Statue of Liberty  And  And pointed at the  Statue of Liberty  And said  That's a woman  No  Oh  A few  Glove gloves  That was a boat crash  You know 
[03:33:30]  You know  I should have  Just enjoyed  Your  It was taking  Too long  To get to  You were going  Well  You're circling  And I saw you  Going  Oh shit  Well you kind of  Threw me off  I had a really good line  And then you killed  With that line  And then I'm like  Why am I doing this  In the middle of it  I'm like  Why am I even doing this now  Why  Comedy is all about timing  I'm like  I knew  As soon as I started  I'm like  Why am I doing this  Why  Wow  That is so funny  Having to explain it  And being there  All red faced  Oh it's the worst  Oh  I'm just circling the statues 
[03:34:00]  Statue of Liberty  Whenever you pluralize something  You have to make it singular  Arrgh  Arrgh  Arrgh  Wow that was rough  Yeah  That was very uncomfortable  We've all been there  We've all been there  Here's another bomb  From British Paul  Is that his name  On the show now  British Paul  I don't know  Yeah  Roll that  No they just felt like  There was nothing  Moving them around  Like dead weight  Yeah  Was it like holding arms  Those thin muscle-less calves  Two white shoes on 
[03:34:30]  Fucking nurse shoes  Useless shoes  Never  The soles never get dirty  Pristine sneakers  Still have that like  New sticker on the bottom  They're transic clean  Because imagine that scene  From I'm going to get you sucker  Where to go  Put some legs up  On the nightstand  But they were real  Fuck  You didn't know  Fucking Obie  Just fucked me up  Yeah he's describing sex 
[03:35:00]  With a lady that's paralyzed  From the waist down there  Alright we got another bomb  From British Paul  Finishing up the bomb section  Of the bombs and flubs bit  So how did you  Did you kind of think like  Hmm this is perplexing  Because if she's numb down there  What the hell am I supposed to do  If she says  That's a huge fucking dick  When it's in there  I'll be like  Hmm what if she's lying  You know  You know  She'd definitely be lying 
[03:35:30]  Oh I love when they bomb  Very good  How did Kev not get any bombs  Wow  What did you go back a week  You just went a week  Didn't you  Well because we just  Kind of came up with this thing  Gonna have to really go through  The history of the time  We've been here  Drudge up some of those old bombs  Because this is a great new bit  It really is  I like it  There's some  The flubs  Go back a little farther  Alright 
[03:36:00]  Alright  Now here's some flubs  Anthony from the show  Here's old Jimmy Norton  Jimmy  The flubs are all  Jimmy and I  That's it  Really  No Anthony  I know  And no one else from the show  Ant does weigh in on one  And flub in the process  Oh goody  Oh  Can we guess which one here  No I'm just  Oh well  Leave it  Teased  Flubs  Eric Logan sent out  An ass email  About these tapes  And he said that  She's having a tough time  At the breakup  That might have been better 
[03:36:30]  If I didn't say  He sent out an ass email  Ass email  Yeah he did say that  An ass email  Yeah  I remember that one  That's technically everyone  That Logan sends out  Ah look  You're recouped  Right here  Months later  Alright here's another one  From Jimmy  That's great  Detroit Autowalker  I had Ivan  Ivan Demjeniuk  Was the name I was  I remember  Right there you go  Of course  But I couldn't get  Detroit Autowalker  And a Detroit Autowalker 
[03:37:00]  Named Ivan Demjeniuk  Ah ha ha ha  Ah ha ha  Ah ha ha  Ah ha ha  Ah ha ha  Ah ha ha  Did you see that jerk  Ha ha ha  Ha ha ha  Yeah  Ah ha ha  Ha ha ha  Ha ha ha  Ha ha ha  Ha ha ha  Ha ha ha ha  Ha ha ha ha  Ha ha ha ha  Ha ha ha ha  Yeah  Ha ha ha ha  Here's myself  Flubbing away  The bleeps aren't cursed  Are they  No  The bleeps aren't cursed  Yes they are  Stay away from the bleeps  They are cursed 
[03:37:30]  They've been damned  Ha ha ha ha  We got a little  Mixed up there  Happens every day  Actually  Here's Jimmy  As you're blowing out  Your 80th birthday cake  Candles  A couple of large men  Come in with gloves  And push your face  Into it  Until your feet  Stop moving  What are gloves  I don't know  I don't know  Sounds that Connor and Lacey make  Oh my god  Hey, Flub, but came back strong  Wow, you certainly did, Jimmy 
[03:38:00]  You came back strong  It's not been a great joke  Until you're blowing out your 80th birthday candles  And men push your face into the cake until you die  I don't know what I was talking about  But I'm really proud of myself  I wish I could have got that one out  Yeah, good one  Conceptually a gem  Back to me  If you want to see the epitome of an absolutely  Epitome  Oh, epitome, sorry  Epitome, Jesus Christ  Oh my lord  Epitome, yeah, I remember that one  All right, well  Anthony's perfect, so we go back to Jimmy 
[03:38:30]  No, I know I got plenty  We were just kidding when we simulated the home invasion  We didn't really rape his rife wife  Ah, fuck  Rape his rife  We didn't rape his rife  We didn't rape his rife  I'd dive apart  Hey, are you  You brag with us  You actually just said it right  I know  It's stinking  It's stinking  What, are we in Taiwan?  What the hell?  God  Waked his rife  I don't know  I was so eager to spit that one out  My little rotten thin lips wouldn't open fast enough 
[03:39:00]  You were stumbling through that line right from the beginning  You could hear him like  You were constantly trying to catch up with your tongue  Back to me  Does Flavor Flay and VH1 and everyone realize that we're off the air in like 15 minutes?  You do know it's Flavor Flav  He's running a little late, he should be here soon  Oh, but do you absolutely know it's Flavor Flav?  Yeah  With a V?  Yeah, but that's how they say it in the ghetto  Flavor Flay  Do they say Flavor Flay?  They get lazy at the end of words sometimes  No, it's actually Flavor Flavor 
[03:39:30]  That's why Flavor Flav is the cuddle  Flavor Flavor  But you could just say Flavor Flay  Fuh  I don't know, that's been nitpicking a bit  A little bit  Back to Jimmy  Did the soup actually fall into the soup  Or did the part where your mouth goes just commit suicide and jump?  I think it was where my mouth goes  Did the soup actually fall into the soup?  Wait, did I say that?  Oh my god  Did I say that you just said, did the soup actually fall into the soup? 
[03:40:00]  Well, that's a legitimate question because sometimes soup will get mixed up  And I hate when another man's soup falls into my soup  Did your phone fall into your phone?  Wow  You just don't even know that you did that  I just love Anthony, just the disappointment in his voice  Right after someone flubs  Well, I enjoy Jimmy so much that I want to hear what he's saying  And when he fucks it up, it's taking away entertainment from me 
[03:40:30]  That's right  He's stealing from you  But you also get a little joy out of it  I get a lot of joy out of it  You said epitome  You can't get past that  Well, look how it's spelt  It's spelt epitome  All right, I don't want to do this bit anymore  This bit stinks  And I'm thinking, you know, I got some outdoor space in Manhattan  Maybe I'll have an alpaca running around  Yeah, they have a lifespan of 15 to 20 years 
[03:41:00]  So, you know, the kid won't be heartbroken right away like a goldfish or something  And they look like llamas?  Llamas?  Llamas  I corrected myself really fast  Boss would have said, why?  Jesus  Oh, black llamas  That's good  Hey, the llama  The llama  Oh, this is painful  Back to Jimmy 
[03:41:30]  Because Anthony's perfect  Yeah  I had a bigger ride when Cronkate  Cronkate  Oh  Oh, at least you didn't say Cronkate  Cronkate  Gave a sexier proclamation of JFK's death  Was what I was going  Took his glasses off  That was hot  Yeah  Cronkate  Cronkate  Oh, you horrible  Disgusted with himself 
[03:42:00]  Cronkate  That's a good one  All right  It's kind of like the Cronkite Watergate scandal  Mark that one, fan  Asterisk  Asterisk  In case you need a little reference  That's a flom  I bet you bomb it a flub  Here's another one  One day I'll change it  And just say I grabbed Richard by the hair and said, suck my cock, bitch 
[03:42:30]  Suck my cock  Cop?  Jesus, forget it in a bit  Suck my cock  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Can we put a siren on that car?  Yeah  Yeah  All right  Oh, dear Lord  And finally  The last bomb and flub for today  Who is it?  It's not you  Give me an H  Give me a Y  Give me an S  Give me a T  Give me an R  What's it spell? 
[03:43:00]  The beginning of hysterectomy  Hysterectomy?  Hysterectomy  Is it H  E  No, H-Y  H-Y  S-T-E-R  You said R  S-T-E-R  Yeah, you said S-T-E-R  You sure?  I'm positive  Play the tape back  I'm pretty sure I said E-R  No, you fucked up  I certainly didn't  Hysterectomy  I'm sorry, you'll have to get a hysterectomy  But did you hear the way I bailed out?  I didn't feel like spelling out the entire word  Of course, especially after leaving out a letter 
[03:43:30]  Hysterectomy  It's not bad at all  A little comma in there  Just take that letter out  Let's say hi to Andy in New Jersey  You sound friendly  Andy  Yo, what's up?  Hey, listen, Anthony does mess up  And every time he says finger, younger  Finger, younger  Stop it  Finger  It's good that you picked those two words to put together, too  Finger, younger  Nathaniel, bravo  Good job 
[03:44:00]  Thank you  Yes  The first installment of Bombs and Flubs  How come there's no enthusiastic applause coming from the booth?  It's weird  Yeah, what?  Anyone want to take any credit now?  For a little help?  No  To be honest  It's cute  They're a little jealous  I think so  There you go  All yearning  Like puppies in a basket  When you take one out and pet it  They all look like  Why aren't you petting me?
