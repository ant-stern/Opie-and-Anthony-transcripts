<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, utilizing a consistent style of crude humor and offensive language throughout.  The show began with a segment focusing on Erica, who brought a vintage “lesbian couch” to the studio.  The crew inspected it with a blacklight, jokingly identifying stains as semen.  Erica discussed her anxiety, a recent 12-hour sleep episode, and the closing of her family’s antique store, delaying her wedding.  She gifted the hosts items, including a dish Opie subsequently broke, leading to an argument after she spilled poker chips.  The segment also included offensive commentary on a news program made by people with disabilities.

The show then transitioned into a series of comedic bits.  These included a mockingly edited clip of a news reporter at a Democratic Convention, crude jokes about Peter Jennings, and insensitive commentary on an interview with Al Franken featuring a person with speech impediments.  Triumph the insult comic dog's offensive convention clips were played, followed by a prank call to Rob Reiner using offensive language.  John and Al's musical parody of *Silence of the Lambs* was aired, followed by other submitted clips containing crude humor.  An interview with Charles Ross, a one-man Star Wars show performer, was repeatedly interrupted by abusive phone calls from a listener using the name "Ramone," ultimately leading Ross to leave, only to return after the hosts learned of his illness and apologized. The segment concluded with a pre-recorded bit by Paul R. Nelson.

The next segment featured the recurring phrase "I'm Paul R. Nelson,"  a discussion of a Wisconsin political ad attacking Congressman Ron Kind, a debate about a producer's dog-smelling car (and a hypothetical coworker shooting scenario), and a discussion of an intern, Harry T., deceptively requesting a bit. This section included a “Trainables” segment on teaching intellectual disabilities about periods.

A listener's home video, depicting a sexually suggestive scene of Nathaniel’s sister Jill (around 12-13) learning about sanitary pads, was played and reenacted.  This was followed by a sexually explicit call from Lisa from Florida detailing an encounter with Doug Stanhope, who joined the call.  Finally, Eric Logan (“Elo”) delivered a critical review of “The Than and Sam Show,” focusing on drunk driving encouragement, poor technicality, and lack of host cohesion.

A subsequent segment started with an unexplained scenario involving a “starter kit” and hepatitis concerns, before shifting to a discussion of a large sum of money won and an overwhelmingly foul smell. The show then recounted the story of Gus and Elmer, two elderly gay men who married in Canada, using highly offensive and homophobic language and sound effects. Master Poe’s accidental OnStar button-pressing incidents were recounted with Master Poe present in-studio.  Finally, the “ONA TV Edits” segment featured re-edited clips from previous shows, replacing offensive language with absurd substitutes.

The show concluded with a segment cleaning up previously aired, highly offensive material.  Opie, Anthony, "Martini Steve," "Than," and "Travis" compared original and edited versions, struggling to find suitable replacements for profanity.  E-Rock's early, offensive writings from his "What the F?" column were read, with E-Rock present in-studio. The show ended with a segment involving a Ouija board attempt to contact the N-word (repeatedly using the slur), framed as commentary on the absurdity of giving offensive words power.  Throughout the entire broadcast, the hosts and callers employed highly offensive language and humor, with frequent use of profanity, homophobic slurs, and graphic sexual descriptions.

The virus, the Opie and Anthony Show.  The worst.  Let me tell you something.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the worst.  I think I would rather die in my sleep.  Today's material was handpicked by our own Nathaniel.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Welcome, everyone.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show, special edition, where each of the staff members  gets to pick their favorite bits.  I'm starting it off because I'm Tham.  These are all going to be my favorite bits of the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Joining me today is Sam of the Tham and Sam Show.  Hello, Tham.  And Travis.  Hi, Tham. 
[00:01:00]  You know, Tham, I think that you come on first because you put number one at number one.  Thank you, Sam.  I agree.  I like your fresh take on this one.  Thanks.  I feel like I've never said that before in my life.  The very first bit we're going to play today is when somebody tried to give the new XM Studio  at the time a new lesbian couch.  Yes, the lesbian couch, a very naughty device indeed.  And I guess some people were unhappy with it, namely Opie. 
[00:01:30]  And a new term is born.  What is it?  Guess.  Pokering.  Poker chipping.  Oh, I almost had it.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony.  Well, we got Erica in the studio.  Hello.  It's Couch Lady.  Hi.  How are you?  Hello.  So, what's the deal?  You were supposed to be here last week with the couch?  Yes, and unfortunately, I had a little incident. 
[00:02:00]  What?  Incident?  Oh.  Infection?  No.  In what?  I don't know.  I guess I had anxiety last week.  Oh, you had an anxiety attack?  I had an anxiety attack.  Is that why our porn stars had to have lesbian sex on a piece of fiberglass?  Is that what it was?  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  So, I was going to wake up really early in the morning.  Wait, are you the same girl that was just sitting out there?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was just wondering.  Because there's other girls that have been walking through.  I guess he was a little confused.  There's another girl sitting next to me that's blonde. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, okay.  I told you there's a bunch of people out there now.  Oh.  I get you.  Oh.  Yeah.  What's your name?  Erica.  Erica.  Erica.  So, you don't want to like a furniture store?  Well, we had an antique consignment shop from the furnishings, and we had a bunch  of stuff that we had.  But you were the same girl sitting right there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I told you.  Huh.  Are you married?  No.  Oh, nice.  I don't know.  She's getting married.  Oh, not nice.  Could you tell us more about the furniture store?  It's closed.  I thought it would make a good addition to the book guy we just listened to. 
[00:03:00]  No, it's...  Why did it close down?  Economy's not good.  No.  And you oversleep a lot?  Pretty much went down the crapper, so...  Yeah.  And I what?  And you oversleep a lot.  I heard you had a problem last week.  Well, no.  He gave me something for anxiety.  Hey, come...  Get back on mic.  Knocked me out cold, and I just did not wake up.  Really?  Wait, who gave you this medicine?  My doctor.  Right.  And so you had some anxiety, and he gave you something to make you sleep?  Yeah.  He goes, here, take one of these.  I'm like...  What were you anxious about?  I don't... 
[00:03:30]  I...  Well, it was things and...  Yeah?  Just...  Just things.  Whatever, and I took one and knocked me out cold for like 12 hours straight, and I...  Same girl, huh?  It worked.  You weren't anxious for 12 hours.  Yeah, exactly.  There's something about this glass.  Kind of works, is what I'm thinking.  Oh, the couch is time.  Oh, here comes the lesbian couch that Erica brought in.  We're having a ceremony.  Do we have any, you know, music that we could play?  We should have thought ahead of time.  Lesbian couch music, Opie.  A little Katie Lang.  What, do you want a polka?  I think there's like a heart filter on that glass or something. 
[00:04:00]  I'm going to watch.  A what?  Like, you know, in the heart videos.  Ugh.  All right, where's the couch?  Very nice.  Jim's on the lesbian couch.  You bet I am.  You want to explain what the lesbian couch is for the people at home?  You're the expert on couches.  It's just a love seat, probably from the 80s.  Yes, it is a love seat.  From the late 80s.  Late 80s?  Probably late 80s.  Only the best for your pals Opie and Anthony.  Early, I don't know exactly what year.  Any stains on it? 
[00:04:30]  No, it's clean.  It's clean?  Where was it all this time?  Yeah, where was it for 20 years?  Come on, tell the truth.  If it doesn't sell in the store after so long, we take ownership of it and it's out in the warehouse for a little while.  It goes to the warehouse for half place.  Oh, we got...  If it doesn't sell...  We got the blacklight.  We're going to make sure this is a...  Oh, good.  Well, you need an extension cord, guys.  I don't think it's going to reach...  Sorry, not as good as through the mirror, Opie.  Is that what you're trying to say?  No, I didn't say that, really.  Yeah, you can say it.  There was...  I don't know.  Like, you just looked different when you were sitting out there. 
[00:05:00]  That's all.  What are you saying?  She's lovely.  Stop.  I know she's lovely.  Stop trying to cause trouble.  Norton's causing trouble.  I'm not alone.  I'm trying to sit on the couch and look at her hiney.  You have a nice hiney.  Oh.  She goes, oh.  Do you have an extension cord?  Are we going to check it with the blacklight?  Yeah, we're going to check it with the blacklight.  All right, we're plugging in the blacklight.  We want to see if anybody's been having any hanky-panky.  Who owned it prior to...  I have no idea.  Oh, you have no idea.  It's nice to find a homicide committed on this couch.  I'm 86.  Could only dream. 
[00:05:30]  Turn off the lights.  Ooh.  This will definitely make this more good-er.  It's light out.  We have to get some curtains, by the way, for them stupid...  We don't need curtains.  Matt, it's curtains for you.  Asked you guys what you wanted.  I could have brought curtains.  The couch is fine.  Yeah, the couch is fine.  A post-1981 couch?  I have no idea what year it's from.  It does look kind of 80.  All right, let's turn on the blacklight.  Here we go.  Yeah, but you know what?  It's fine.  It'll serve the purpose.  Yeah, for a bunch of bikes.  Don't blacklight the girl. 
[00:06:00]  Blacklight the couch.  Oh, boy.  Can you turn it on?  What are you doing?  Why doesn't anything work on this show?  Ever.  Danny.  Danny.  Danny.  Danny.  Danny, get that blacklight working.  That's the important thing.  All right, now we're trying to figure out how to turn on the blacklight.  Come over here.  I'll fill out your card.  Wow, this show is just going downhill in a hurry.  No!  We can't figure out the blacklight.  It's fine.  Danny, what's wrong with the blacklight?  I don't know.  It's not turning on.  Danny.  Danny.  Sorry.  Calm down.  Danny. 
[00:06:30]  It'll be okay.  Well, I tested it before I brought it in to make sure that it worked before I brought  it here.  Perhaps the extension cord's bad.  Perhaps the extension cord's bad.  It's been laying in the booth.  Perhaps plug it directly into the wall and see if it works.  Perhaps the socket is bad.  There you go.  There's plenty of things that...  All right, we got the blacklight on.  It's the extension cord.  It's the extension cord.  Everyone calm down.  All right, pull the couch over and give it a once over.  How do you know if there's a load on there?  What do you see?  Oh, you'll see white.  Oh, my God.  Is that X-Files music?  Very good.  All right, we're checking the lesbian couch for a splooge mark.  So far, so good, right? 
[00:07:00]  Anything?  We're getting a thumbs up.  Oh, they're pointing out something, Steve?  Eric?  Jim?  Yeah.  And on the armrest would be where you would bend a girl over and bang her.  All right, Steve.  Absolutely.  What are you seeing?  Big white stain right on me.  Get out of here.  Let me see.  Armrest.  I'm not lying.  Take a look.  Uh-oh.  What does it look like, Mulder?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  You would absolutely use that part of the couch, too.  You would bend her over that.  That's a definite load right there, a dried-up load.  That light detects semen.  Oh, there's another one. 
[00:07:30]  There's something going on over there where your upper back would rest on the back of the  couch there, Anthony.  All right.  What is that?  Is that urine?  Oh, that's just the design.  No, what is that?  Is that the pattern of the couch?  It is now.  All right.  That's what – I don't know, man.  Is that the pattern of the couch, or is this just splattered?  Sploge stain.  Sploge.  Oh, what about that stain?  That's the pattern.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  All right.  I see the pattern.  The pattern is called jizz stain. 
[00:08:00]  It was very popular in the early 80s.  Oh, there's another one.  Oh, is that a big stain right there?  What do you think?  Wait a minute.  Maybe that's just the pattern, too.  I think we have a relatively clean lesbian couch, Anthony.  I think so, too.  There's one or two spots on it, but –  Well, I don't know.  Let's go back to the stain on the right armrest.  There's leaves in it?  There's leaves in the couch, Anthony.  Yes.  I aired it out yesterday.  What?  What?  I aired it out yesterday, and the leaves –  Outside, and the leaves fell. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  All right.  She aired it out.  Thanks.  Wow.  Look at that.  A condom.  No.  Ugh.  All right.  I think we're pretty clean, though.  It's clean.  It's like a thousand young couches.  Let's go back to this stain over here.  I think this might be just part of the –  No, that's a stain.  Okay.  Yeah, that's a stain.  We definitely have one stain in it.  All right.  Well, hopefully tomorrow we'll get a bunch more stains on that thing.  Okay.  Sorry, Jimmy.  You won't be here.  Ugh.  That was nice.  I like that.  The lights were out.  The X-Files music playing.  Yeah, I like the lights out.  The weird black light on, like they're investigating something. 
[00:09:00]  Very nice.  That was good.  Well, guys, the show became more gooder today.  We now have our lesbian couch back.  Yeah.  Too bad there's no lesbians here to use it.  I know.  Tomorrow.  Yeah, tomorrow we're going to do it.  Maybe they can't make it tomorrow.  The dikes will come out tomorrow.  All right.  Well, I hope you appreciate it.  Very much.  Use it often.  So when are you getting married?  I was supposed to get married this month.  But what happened?  Uh-oh.  Why?  Why?  Uh-oh. 
[00:09:30]  Because of the store closing and other stuff, so we decided to push it off to the summer.  What was the other stuff?  Did he bring it up to you?  Oh, no.  No, it had nothing to do with Ben.  No?  He didn't bring it up to you and say, perhaps, you know, the store closing, we should push  this off?  Yeah, guys tend to really want to postpone those things.  Who's Ben?  I still be my fiance.  Oh, I'm thinking of Ben Sparks here.  Don't say.  Our own producer.  So maybe he whipped out that big, delicious treat.  It's not a big deal.  No?  No.  It's one of those take it or leave it, married or not married things? 
[00:10:00]  Well, whatever.  It will happen.  Isn't it kind of an important thing, though?  It is.  You should be kind of excited about that, no?  You know, yeah, you are, but you can't dwell on it if it happens.  You know, you've got to postpone it.  If it happens, it happens.  If it happens, you know, we're going to eventually love it.  There's a story here.  Yeah.  What's the story?  Come on.  How long have you dated Ben?  I have been dating Ben for a little over three years.  Okay.  Ooh.  His mom owns the store.  Oh, the mom doesn't like you.  Oh, no.  No?  She's in New York. 
[00:10:30]  Oh.  She's cool.  It's just that the economy went down the shitter.  No, it didn't.  People don't want to buy stuff that's used.  Listen to Bush.  It didn't.  It's got leaves on it.  Yeah.  Yeah, they want to buy new stuff and not pay two years in no interest, you know?  So they don't want to go spend more money.  Oh, it was used furniture.  Because it's consignment shop.  Exactly.  It's all used stuff.  Oh, okay.  People kind of want new furniture.  Yeah, they want their furniture without sploge stains on it.  Right.  They want clean furniture.  They want to shop at Siemens, not have furniture with semen on it. 
[00:11:00]  Exactly.  Right.  God forbid they want clean stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Do you have sales on Tuesday starting at noon?  We're selling the best used furniture with the biggest sploge stains this Tuesday night.  I come in for our sploge stain spectacular at sploge stains.  No, of course it's not named sploge stains.  Your store wasn't named sploge stains, was it?  No.  And I'm not going to say the name of the store. 
[00:11:30]  Okay.  So now things with Ben, you kind of, you want to get married, but.  Oh, yeah.  We're totally going to get married.  We're now changing the entire concept of the wedding.  We were going to do that typical, you know, big reception and the one sits down for dinner  and the photographer and the limo, you know, that whole.  You tame it down?  The whole wedding.  Now it's going to be.  Just get a tent in the backyard.  No, that's what we're doing.  We're going.  Money was an issue.  I'm not going to lie.  Okay.  Money was a total issue.  So.  Well, it sounds like it.  Just a tent with a bunch of load-stained couches. 
[00:12:00]  Spending $30,000, we're going to cut it back probably to $10,000.  Fine.  So.  Wow.  We'll just have a big, fat party this summer.  All right.  Sort of sounds like you're going through a tough time.  No.  I mean, not necessarily.  No?  I'm getting through it.  I'm fine.  Well, it sounds like the anxiety and the furniture store closing and the marriage having to be postponed  and scaled back.  I'm a mess.  Fine.  Yeah.  It does sound like, you know, it's a little bit of stress in your life.  And I'm glad you could take time out from your stressful life and bring us a lesbian couch. 
[00:12:30]  So I had all the time in the world.  There are other ways to earn money.  Jimmy will show you.  At the nasty hotel I stayed at last night next door.  Oh, did you stay in the city?  I stayed next door at.  How do you get the couch here?  In your car?  In a minivan.  In a minivan.  Which hotel did you stay at?  The one to the.  Is it the one Opie used to stay at?  Similar.  Oh, yeah?  What's it called?  I don't know.  You tell us.  The one right here to the right of the building.  I don't even know there was a hotel there.  The Salisbury Hotel. 
[00:13:00]  Isn't that awful?  Isn't that a homeless hotel?  I walked in going, ooh.  I think that's a flop house.  It's like a flop house or something.  I thought it was classy.  No.  So not.  The Park of Meridian is right across the street.  And that's a wonderful hotel.  I love it.  Why didn't you stay at the old Park of Meridian?  I didn't even know it was there.  Because business is bad.  No, not necessarily.  I don't really care.  Couldn't afford it, Jim, okay?  Thanks for rubbing it in.  I wouldn't stay there.  For four hours, I mean, I got to bed at midnight.  She can't afford her wedding, and you spend $30,000 a year on hookers. 
[00:13:30]  Why did you get up in the morning?  Why did you?  I didn't know what time necessarily you guys could take it in, so I just decided to go.  We were trying to sleep after the anxiety medication and thinking about the business going down and sleeping in the hotel with the red neon light blinking through the window.  Actually, no, I fell right to sleep, and then I got up and showered and came over here to see you guys.  Wasn't that big a deal?  No.  I'm sorry.  I got nothing.  I'm a mess.  Trying to sleep and this is outside. 
[00:14:00]  What?  What?  I just want to drop the couch off.  No, I'm glad I brought it to you guys.  No, you kidding?  No, we're happy.  You kidding me?  Oh, no, I'm glad.  That's better than the last one we had.  It was a little road trip for me to take, you know?  Yeah, no, awesome.  We'll give you some prizes.  Yeah.  I actually have prizes for you guys.  What do you have?  What do you have?  I brought some other stuff for you.  What?  What gifts?  Would you like me to get it?  Sure would.  Yeah.  I am...  No, not donkey sausage kind of thing.  No, no, no. 
[00:14:30]  No, follow Ben out the door.  Donkey sausage.  And get the other stuff.  What kind of gifts?  I don't know.  It's just little stuff.  All right, yeah, go get the gifts.  Yeah.  I'd like a gift.  Lock the door.  Lock the door.  Lock the door.  Opiates on outside.  Oh.  I don't know.  I want a...  Audio's on outside.  She's coming back in with her gifts.  All right.  Shut up, Ben.  Jesus.  Ben's giggling like a nut out there.  Bring her in.  Bring her in.  Oh, I didn't know what you were doing.  Bring the lady in with the gifts. 
[00:15:00]  Jesus.  Bring in the present lady.  I'll hear the replay.  Talk anything about me.  I really don't care.  That's what sucks about this show.  Don't.  Stupid replay.  Stupid replay.  Doesn't offend me.  No.  All right.  We like you, actually.  Yeah.  What kind of gifts?  What do we got?  It's a magazine.  A sink magazine that we're in?  A sign gift.  That we have?  Huh?  You want us to sign stuff?  That's a gift.  And what's with the pink hat?  Pink hat?  Is that a gift?  Is that yours?  Steve, we got a gift. 
[00:15:30]  No, like I said, the store's closed and, you know, I listen all the time.  So, you know, I heard a couple different things.  Oh, boy.  Went to the store and grabbed some stuff just for...  Oh, righty.  To grab you guys.  All right.  Let's see what she's got for everybody.  Well, I have...  Buckle in.  Well, considering Opie has nothing to entertain with, I grabbed something.  Uh-oh.  Oh, it's not bad.  What is it?  Is it one of those things that's used for jacking off, like, in 10 to midnight?  No, it's just a simple little dish that he can just throw on the table.  Oh, and like chips can go in there? 
[00:16:00]  Oh, wow.  This is like a housewarming.  Hey, you haven't got a housewarming gift yet, have you?  So, you gave Opie something that is breakable.  It's gay.  I really, you know, it's just grab some stuff.  Let's wait till we all get our gifts.  Why would you give Opie something that he could perhaps accidentally drop?  Let's wait till we all get it.  You could have washed it before he gave it to me.  Jesus, this leftover dip in the dip part.  What's the price tag on the back?  Uh, she spent $13.50 on me.  Thank you.  And then I got two beer pitchers for you guys, in case. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, we might need pitchers.  That's true.  Hey, I just grabbed some stuff.  Don't wait.  I don't understand.  Don't be defensive.  You're bringing us gifts, and we appreciate them.  I'll just smash this.  No.  He is the worst.  What?  I didn't say anything.  You are the worst.  Now, that's a nice pitcher.  It is a nice pitcher.  Is it glass?  No, it's that hard plastic, right?  It's plastic.  Those are good to drink beer out of if you're starring in Young Frankenstein.  I thought it was glass.  All right.  What's that? 
[00:17:00]  What do you got over there?  Looks like a Claymore mine.  What is that?  Oh, I think it's poker chips?  Poker chips?  From the 1940s.  It's poker chips that Al Capone used.  You obviously stopped at a garage sale on the way down to New York.  It looks like poker chips in a hat box.  Oh, they're in a hat box.  Wow.  Wow.  I got some...  You got any cards with those chips?  Yes.  Oh, let's have a little hand just for fun. 
[00:17:30]  Poker chips.  I could sit here now and shuffle chips with one hand.  Wow.  Like they do on the World Series of Poker.  That's just wonderful.  This is good.  I'll bet there's a gift for Jim Norton in there.  This probably sat on top of a 60s-style folding poker table for years.  I hate my gift.  What is that?  I...  I'm...  Dude, it's a joke because they were ranking on you.  You had nothing.  What is...  What's that?  My gift stinks. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, wow.  Oh, they're playing cards from the Moshe...  Moshe Suck...  Moshe Suck Valley Railroad Company.  What the fuck is this?  Wow, I guess that...  I guess there must be some more gifts in there.  Now that's it.  No?  Wait, you got a beer pitcher for Jim?  I just grabbed him for all of you to hear.  But what about Jim?  Jim, I don't...  It's for everybody.  But that's not fair.  No, these are for everybody.  It's not necessarily...  I mean...  But I don't drink alcohol.  Exactly. 
[00:18:30]  Could someone open the window?  Yeah, I'll take it back.  All right.  Name of the game is Texas Hold'em, boys.  Ooh, you got chips and everything.  Yeah, that would be great if they weren't...  That pack wasn't missing aces.  Card with little cards.  Are there 52 in there?  I don't think there's 52 cards there.  Oh, this second.  I never brought these in after Donkey's sausage.  At least the other pack of cards is still wrapped.  Yeah.  Yeah, I got one wrapped, one unwrapped.  Would you gamble at the bus station on the way here?  Yes, I did. 
[00:19:00]  And then this pack, because there's four decks of cards, both of these are still wrapped.  Atta boy.  I'd love to know where these came from.  No idea.  Where'd you get them?  The store.  What store?  Her store.  Someone probably bought them in.  I can't imagine why the store is going under.  I just can't fathom.  With little tidbits like this?  Little trinkets and knickknacks?  Yeah, you might need better stuff in your store.  Maybe that's what it is. 
[00:19:30]  Wow.  You were selling this?  There's plenty of stuff in there that was very nice.  I bet.  That's only the best for your pals, huh?  You can throw it out the window.  Opie, stop looking around.  I know him.  You break it.  I'd be happy if you broke it.  I'm just trying to figure out where I could break it.  This place is so nice and new.  No, no.  This state-of-the-art studio that we're in.  It's a bit.  Opie doesn't really break things.  That's a gang from XM Satellite built for us.  Opie doesn't really break things.  It's a joke.  I never broke a thing in my life. 
[00:20:00]  It's a bit.  Oh, the cards have little trains on them.  Yeah, little choo-chos.  Choo-choo!  Well, if you haven't broken anything yet, you might as well, because it could be the first  thing you break in the studio.  You broke your mouse, but that could be the second thing.  That's a good gift.  You could have people over.  You could put the dip in the one thing and the chips in the surrounding dish.  Oh, Martha Stewart.  Very good suggestion.  All right.  Well, this is lovely.  Thank you.  I'm done.  There's your couch.  All right.  Thank you for the couch and the gifts and everything. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, you're welcome.  Why do you look so dejected?  Yeah.  I'm very happy.  I play cards and now I have chips and two two-chain cards.  Yeah, now you have two packs of cards and a felt case.  Yeah, the case is felt with some gold leaf trim on the side.  That's right.  It's like an old velour shirt I had when I was eight.  Can I see those pictures?  Yeah.  I promise you're not going to break it.  Don't break anything.  No, I need the other one, too.  That's not bad.  Oh, I can't break this. 
[00:21:00]  No, why would you?  It's glass.  It is glass, right?  They're both real glass?  Yeah, people will.  It's plastic.  I was ready to shower to that.  No, I wasn't.  I'm kidding.  No.  All right, Ben.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Enjoy.  We got the lesbian couch, which we will use tomorrow.  Opie got a nice gift and Anthony got a nice gift.  I don't drink, but I have beer pictures that I can share with the group.  You can put some soda pop in it.  You don't watch the New York Times, do you?  You can put some soda pop in it.  Maybe I can have a Coke. 
[00:21:30]  All right, thank you.  Oh, you're welcome, guys.  Okay.  Have a good one.  Thank you.  We have to take our picture, don't we?  Well, we're going to.  Okay.  Yeah, we'll do that.  Wait, wait, wait.  No, don't.  Don't.  You're going to go right through that window.  It's going to go through the control room window.  No, Opie.  Oh, my God, no.  Opie, don't.  Don't do it.  She's still in there.  Oh, my God. 
[00:22:00]  See, you put dip in that.  Put dip in a little.  And then you put the chips in the around there.  It's not even washed out.  It's nice.  And you can.  Look at the remnants from the dip.  From the going away party.  Great party, isn't it?  When you have your little party on Sunday for football.  Yeah.  Why is this place so nice?  There's nothing to break it on.  No, you know, don't drop it on the floor.  Opie.  Opie, Opie, Opie.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He just gave Jaime a heart attack.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Opie. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, my God.  You threw it.  Oh, my God.  It's broken all over.  Yeah, you got the little.  Now you just separated.  You can put the dip in that dish.  All right.  I'm not even looking out the window.  I can't even look at her face now.  Why?  Because she gave you something and you fucking broke it.  I didn't think it would break that easily.  It's ceramic.  It's rare when you throw ceramic on a hard floor that it breaks. 
[00:23:00]  I could see where you'd be confused.  Oh, my God.  You are the worst human.  She's ready for her picture with you, Opie.  I can't even look at her face.  No.  Why?  Oh, God.  Not even smiling at all.  I can't believe you.  I cannot believe you.  You can fix that.  A little glue.  Opie, look out the window.  I can't.  Look out the window.  She's going to cry.  I'm sorry. 
[00:23:30]  Is she smiling?  You can put this right back together.  This is not even that much damage.  You know?  All right.  Well.  Oof.  All right.  Well.  Let's get out of this uncomfortable situation, please.  She's really hurt.  Opie, let's go.  All right.  What do we got?  Frunkus.  Hey, this is Jim Norton, Frunkus, and there are photos and videos of the material you just  heard on opianthony.com.  Meow.  Anthony, you got any impressions? 
[00:24:00]  Will?  I'm just guiding the material.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Norton was just lying on the, uh, lesbian couch.  It stinks, huh?  It's fine. It smells moldy. I'm just tired. I don't care.  All right. Well, I like the lesbian couch. Thumbs up to the lesbian couch.  It'll smell like... It has only one splooge stain, so that's good.  That'll change up. Were you trying to give her a thumbs up through the window?  How revolting was that? Thumbs up. 
[00:24:30]  And she just... I'm with you. She's just staring into space.  She's not even looking at you. No.  She's not trying to make up for smashing her gift.  I just kind of tossed it to the side, and then it's shattered. I don't know.  It's ceramic, and you broke it on purpose, and you giggled.  You are an awful person. All right, well.  Man's doing nothing but trashing those awful 1951 poker chips.  Yeah, see, that's the difference, though, man.  What? Why don't you say what you were saying during the commercial break,  how much I hate your poker chips.  I said... And wish I had balls like me.  That these days... Those chips stink. 
[00:25:00]  Nowadays, you can get the same chips you play with in Vegas.  You know who uses chips like that? Third graders.  Yeah, these chips are... They need a little weight.  They don't have any weight to them. Right, they need some weight.  These are the plastic chips you used to play with with, like, your junior high buddies.  They're awful.  You'd steal them from your parents and play poker.  They are awful plastic chips.  Give her the chips back.  Yeah, you gotta give them back.  Just tell her you don't want them.  You might have to... Oh, Brady's a good point. 
[00:25:30]  Tell her you don't want her stupid chips.  Why do I have to be part of your rudeness?  Because you're, like, all Brave War in commercial break.  But I can understand, you know, that something might suck and I might hate it, but I'm not gonna...  And, Norton, what about you?  What? These gifts stink.  They do stink.  I don't... I don't... I don't want to be known as the bad guy today.  I'm not the one with a hat box full of chips.  A hat box full of chips.  It's a Lucille Ball hat box she bought when she was out with Viv.  Dude, she got that from a garage sale.  That little stupid hat in the box.  Yeah.  Now, take it back, Lucy. 
[00:26:00]  Now, Anthony, what's what it looks like?  Call her back in here.  But I understand I can get a bad gift and still be nice and not hurt people's feelings.  Call her back in here and give her her gift back.  Why do I have to hurt someone's feelings?  I will not bow to peer pressure and hurt someone's feelings.  Call her in.  Call her out on her gift.  I will tell her her gift sucks, but I will keep it.  Oh, you will, huh?  Just give it back.  Yeah, let's see Anthony say that.  You're really not coming back in here.  Are you insane?  Hi, Erica.  I just wanted to say Opie had a little mishandling of your gift. 
[00:26:30]  He bobbled it a little while he was trying to put it over by his stuff and it broke.  But I have the cards and chips and thank you.  You guys, I know, I know.  Anthony, tell her.  Throw them out.  You hate them.  I don't care.  What?  Tell her.  Don't bother me.  What?  Are those good chips?  I'm not saying that they're bad chips.  Are they good chips?  No, they're old.  They're probably from the 70s.  I just grabbed them.  70s Earth Mama chips.  70s Earth Mama Muff chips.  Throw them away.  It would have been cool if it came from Frank Sinatra's house, but obviously it didn't. 
[00:27:00]  You know, they could be worth money.  You don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Well, if they were worth money, you'd be getting married.  What's wrong with that?  That's a genuine wood chip holder, isn't it?  Hey, give me those chips.  I'll get that away from my face, Steve.  Give Opie the chips.  Look, I'm just thinking I like them.  I really do, but I'm thinking maybe somebody else could use them more than I could.  I'd be more than happy to take them and throw them in the trash for you, Anthony. 
[00:27:30]  No, I'm not going to throw them in the trash, but perhaps somebody could use them more.  Tell her.  Take them back, Anthony.  Just give them to me.  Tell her.  She's yelling.  Tell her.  I'm trying to be nice.  What do you mean somebody else?  Why am I being yelled at?  You play Texas Hold'em.  Why can't you use those?  Well, they're just not quite the type of equipment I like playing with.  What kind do you like playing with?  They're chips and cards.  Well, different cards and different chips.  People play with different types of things.  Yes, sir.  I'll pass it back to Steve.  Just give her the chips.  Just give those to her. 
[00:28:00]  It's heavy.  Yeah, these are the cards that are still-  There you go.  They're all wrapped up.  See?  They're still wrapped.  They're all wrapped up.  You ever play 52 card pick-up?  Oh, gee.  Oh, B.  There's no reason they eat the cards at her.  Did the cards hit you?  Did they?  Oh, B.  She had cards fall off her sleeve.  Come on.  No.  Oh, God damn it.  Oh, my God. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, B.  Holy shit.  Oh, B.  Don't video tape.  Oh, boy.  Now, clean it up.  Are you happy now, Opie?  Are you happy?  I am mortified.  Oh, Eric Collins.  She spilled my chips.  I knew you'd do stuff like this. 
[00:29:00]  She spilled my chips.  Oh, God.  You guinea brat.  Now, clean it up.  That's right.  Be a poker player, just like your father.  Oh, my God.  I'm mortified.  I apologize for the other half of this program.  Don't apologize. 
[00:29:30]  I don't really care.  That is uncalled for.  That was uncalled for.  I hope you got a good laugh.  I hope you got a good laugh.  Got.  He's still immersed in it.  It's fine.  He can laugh.  I can't even talk to you.  That is horrible, man.  I knew from the start it was a bad idea to bring those in on the first place.  I should have just brought the couch and be done with it. 
[00:30:00]  That is horrible.  Look.  I didn't have a problem with him or anything.  I hope for some reason, I don't understand why he's got to be like that.  I apologize for the actions of some of the people on this program.  Enjoy picking up your poker chips. 
[00:30:30]  Thank you.  You guys can finish your show and talk about me and do whatever you want.  I don't care.  There she goes.  Wait, wait.  She's walking away.  Wait, can you take these?  Oh, look.  She's getting her stuff.  She's not even going to sit back down.  She's getting her stuff and walk.  Oh, my God.  There she goes.  Ben, go smooth things over.  Ben, smooth things over a little bit.  Remember when Rick had to smooth things over? 
[00:31:00]  Guess what?  Now it's your fucking job.  You wanted to be the big dog.  Go ahead.  There it is.  Yeah, you're the big producer now.  Go fix that.  That is the biggest laugh I've had on the show.  We broke it.  You fix it.  Because the way you threw them and rolled them across the console, it was a heavy thud and  they rolled and all just fell off.  And the chips are flying out and the chip carrier fell on her foot.  It was the most horrible thing I've ever seen one person do to another.  That's the biggest laugh I've had on the show.  I couldn't breathe. 
[00:31:30]  You are an awful person.  I literally could not breathe.  I was laughing so hard.  I don't know how you do that.  That just makes me so happy.  Those are things you think about doing sometimes, but no human does them.  But Opie, just say, I'll break your bowl.  I'll throw the chips at you.  I'll fling the cards at your face.  Oh, these chips have coffee stains on them.  These are awful.  Oh, see, now you're brave.  Oh, I can't be brave with you.  Holy S. The back of my skull hurts.  I laugh so hard.  Eric from Jersey.  The sound of plastic chips raining to the floor is the saddest sound I've ever heard. 
[00:32:00]  It will be like the sound of the thousands of tears she's going to shed in the car.  Yeah.  Just walked outside with Ben.  Ben's talking to her right now.  Yeah.  Gave her a nice garbage bag full of ONA stuff.  She is bawling, crying.  Oh, my God.  See, I knew it.  Here's what she said.  She goes, I don't mind if he broke it, but he threw it at me.  Oh, no.  And she turned her face into the wall near the elevator and that's all you're hearing. 
[00:32:30]  Stop it.  You are horrible.  Cringe radio is back, boys and girls.  It's about effing time.  She threw the chips.  I didn't throw him at her.  Are things being smoothed over, though?  He actually didn't throw him at her.  I'm going to go check now.  I was a very good athlete when I was growing up and trust me, I didn't throw him at her.  Go fix that.  I made it very close.  Go fix that.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's awful. 
[00:33:00]  I cannot believe that.  I'm horrified.  All right.  Opie has no soul.  Evil to the core.  Yeah.  That's what they're writing.  And I wonder why I'm alone.  Opie is the effing antichrist.  And I wonder why I'm alone.  I go home alone every day, and I wonder why.  Why am I alone?  Oh, my Jesus.  Can't figure that one out.  You made her cry.  I didn't want her to cry. 
[00:33:30]  She was nice, and she tried to be good-natured about it.  I know.  She tried to take the ribbing.  It was the loud chips falling before the thing rolled off the console.  I know.  That was a big bet.  I'm all in.  I will splash the pot whenever the fuck I please.  Dude, you've got to read something to the end of the feedback.  This guy, Cody from Buffalo.  Hope you put some good force into throwing those chips. 
[00:34:00]  Sounds like some South American ring stick.  No, that's, um, I was horrified during that whole thing.  An update?  Yeah.  Yeah, Ben's calming her down.  Steve's out there.  They're, you know, getting her to breathe and calm down.  And they're going to try to see if she wants to come back in and get her picture.  Yeah, because she wanted pictures and stuff.  Tell her if she cleans up. 
[00:34:30]  Say you're brave without her in the studio.  That's the difference.  All right, I admit it.  That's the difference between you and I.  Say that to her face.  No, I've done enough.  Haven't you done enough?  I think I've done enough.  I can't, uh...  I don't know even...  Hey, what's going on out there?  It's just, it's not, it's not fun, Hope.  We threw it right at her.  I didn't throw it right at her.  Do we have the videotape?  You didn't get that on videotape?  Yeah, I did.  You got that on videotape?  It kind of rolled on the console.  I kind of just rolled it at her. 
[00:35:00]  Okay, well...  She had plenty of time to get out of the way.  Oh, jeez.  She's a little upset.  Yeah, I would get it.  We drove all the way here from Rhode Island.  Used to give something to the show.  Yeah.  Want to get her photo.  Oh my God, she comes here to give something to the show and get a picture with Opie and  Anthony.  Well, maybe she should have gave something to us from this decade.  What are you, who are you to say that our gifts aren't good enough?  You know what, he raised frankincense and myrrh not a good enough gift, Opie?  We're starting a rule on this show. 
[00:35:30]  You bring gifts, don't get them from a garage sale.  That's all we ask.  You know, baby Jesus' best gift he got was a song from a little drummer boy, Opie.  That's right.  It had nothing to do with materialism, had nothing to do with the gold, frankincense,  and myrrh might have been good gifts, but the little drummer boy's song was the best gift  of all.  And I'd have taken that over those lousy chips.  All right, let me see the video, Anthony.  All right, here's the video.  We're looking back at the tape.  She's all smiley. 
[00:36:00]  Steve, I'll need a screening when you're done there.  Oh, my God.  Well, you kind of missed the toss, but you got the aftermath.  I wasn't really expecting you to do that, to be honest.  Oh, gee.  What did you think he was going to do, play a hand?  It's like catching a UFO.  You're just not expecting it.  Wow, look at Norton.  This is going to be great for foundrymusic.com.  I'm all in.  Show Anthony.  All right, bring that over here.  I got to see that.  I think the audio will really help that clip, because you were too close on her face.  But all you see is the chips go flying by her. 
[00:36:30]  All right, well.  All right, let me get a look.  All right, there's Opie with the devious smile on his face.  She's talking.  Still, yes, smiling.  Oh, my God.  No, that's...  Oh, you see it clearly.  You see the chips flying by on the table.  Yes, Ben.  Not as if we've done enough damage to being in this new building already.  Yeah.  There's people just coming to work, getting off the elevator.  Yeah.  That see this all going on in the hallway and are just mortified. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, they see her crying out front, him filming it.  Oh.  See that, yeah.  Not even trying to comfort her.  Could you face this way when you break down emotionally?  I'm horrified.  I am horrified.  Yeah, I'm not going to fix this one.  See, this is the type of thing, the barrier that people say, you know, how far do you take things on satellite radio?  That's where, you know, I think the line should have been drawn somewhere. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  Girl just trying to bring some gifts to the show.  I definitely...  Give me those, I'll pass them to her.  She enjoys...  What?  What?  Give me those, I'll pass them to her.  You're horrible, man.  That clip is hilarious.  You can see her face, I mean, in the background, you can see the chips just flying by on the table.  Look at the construction workers looking at them like, what the hell is going on in there?  All right, well...  Awful.  Should we take our last break and then regroup here, I guess?  I think, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that was great. 
[00:38:00]  I...  Why don't you go out and take your picture with her, Ope?  Yeah.  Old fan from the AF days.  She's been a fan since the AF days.  Whatever.  First time in ten years she's going to meet us.  Go buy Demented World and shut up.  No, she's a nice lady.  It's the worst.  The worst.  We'll be back with more of the worst of Opie and Anthony featuring Nathaniel.  Lady like it.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:38:30]  Opie and Anthony.  The Anthony Show.  The worst.  It's the worst.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  The worst.  With Nathaniel.  Holy mackerel am I enjoying that radio program.  Welcome back to the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  I'm hosting this particular segment.  I'm Tham.  You're hosting the host show.  Yeah, I'm hosting today.  Sam is joining me from the Than and Sam show and as is Travis.  Hi.  That's enough. 
[00:39:00]  All right.  This bit is when some specially abled people.  Retards.  What are their special?  I blew his punchline.  I had a really funny one last time.  Well, we weren't recording last time.  I know.  It was when some specially abled individuals.  What were their special abilities?  To fly and be retarded.  See?  Much funnier before Travis gave away the punchline.  It's not my fault we're equally funny. 
[00:39:30]  This is the worst worst of show of all time.  Well, just because we're doing this for the second time.  Which is a compliment.  Thank you.  We're stuff.  Yeah.  Some specially abled individuals talked to Al Franken and other people at the Democratic  National Convention because I guess they had their own TV show and it was funny and  they're retarded.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony.  Doris.  It was embarrassing.  Doris from Indiana.  What's going on today?  Not much.  No?  No.  Why are you calling the show?  I want to play What's in My Pants.  You want to play What's in My Pants? 
[00:40:00]  Yep.  You know how to play?  I think I'm first.  What?  I think I do.  Yeah?  All right.  It's where you take the phone and rub it on your intimate area and we guess what kind  of hairstyle you have just from the sound.  Uh-huh.  And you know that.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Do you want to play or what?  We played this yesterday.  We're trying to balance things out.  I think we should play it again.  She called in.  We'll do it quick.  We'll do a quick game.  What about this though?  I know.  I want to do that.  Hmm.  Hmm.  What to do?  I kind of want to play.  Hey, how old a gal are you? 
[00:40:30]  44.  All right.  We're going to play the retard clips.  All right.  We're going to go to the sound clips that we had.  I love that bit.  We got the retards doing the news clips.  Uh-oh, I just want to punch out of this show today. 
[00:41:00]  Um, yeah, let's play the retard clips.  Yeah.  Should we have Doris call in tomorrow?  Why don't you go smooth that one over?  Doris.  Yeah.  Oh.  All right.  Hi.  Hi.  Uh, we might get to you, so hold on the line, all right?  All right.  44 though, huh?  Yep.  How many kids?  30.  Three kids?  Oh, Anthony, we're going to play the, uh...  All right, let's pop that in the, uh, DVD, uh, CD player.  And play the, uh...  Simmonial.  Yeah.  The retard clip?  Sure.  Sure. 
[00:41:30]  Natural, uh, childbirth or, uh, cesarean?  Two were natural and the last one was cesarean.  Oh, boy, look at the time, Anthony.  Um, we might have to leave for the week.  Wow.  All right, well, how's your news?  Ben, go smooth that over.  We would love to talk to her tomorrow.  Yes.  Sure.  Two more years, she'll be able to call up and play What's in My Diaper. 
[00:42:00]  Guess the hairstyle.  Gray?  Uh, Doris?  Yeah?  Jim Norton has something he wants to say to you.  Okay.  I really appreciate you calling the show, and I hope we get to you, because I think it'd  be fun to play the game with you.  Okay.  Do you have a bunt?  Excuse me?  A bunt.  A bunt?  A bunt.  You know what that is, a bunt cake?  You know, it's not a belly, and it's not a...  It's a bunt.  I try. 
[00:42:30]  No, I don't have a bunt cake.  All right.  A bunt cake.  Anthony, do you have anything to say to Doris?  No.  Oh, thank you for calling, and please hold on.  All right?  All right.  All right.  There's Doris from Indiana.  Indiana.  What's in my house dress?  She wants to help the show.  All right, Anthony, how's your news?  It's in my bloomers.  This is a show they did on Trio.  Yeah.  This is retards doing the news.  Yeah.  They were at some camp or something, and all decided it would be kind of cool for them 
[00:43:00]  to get together, something for them to do, put on a news program.  Right.  Where they would do interviews, and tape it, and broadcast it.  Right.  So I think it's a very brave thing to do, Opie.  You know?  Just because they're...  I call them...  You know what I call them, Opie?  Handicapable.  A lot of people say handicapped.  I like saying handicapable.  Well, here's the deal with this.  They're not letting their handicaps get in the way of them fulfilling their dreams. 
[00:43:30]  And living a normal life.  Well, they were at the...  Slowdown.  We got audio of them at the Democratic Convention interviewing celebrities.  Yes.  Yes.  And I'm sorry, man, but how could you not laugh when you listen to this?  And people would call you a jerk for laughing at this.  They would call you a jerk for laughing if they weren't calling you a jerk for the last  half hour of radio.  And I don't know.  It's just really funny.  I'm sorry.  It is funny.  And the people that they try to interview, because I guess they're trying to come across 
[00:44:00]  as a legitimate news outlet, but they're retarded.  And the people that they interview put on that condescending voice, like, oh, yeah, okay.  And they know they have to be nice.  Right.  Like, if it was any schmuck with a microphone that came up to them and was trying to interview  them, they would brush them off.  Nah, nothing for you today.  All right.  But they're retarded, so they have to be nice.  And you could hear it in their voice.  Well, we think, uh...  Well, this was on Trio last night.  We're going to run out of time, so...  Hey, that's great! 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  Let's get to the clips, okay?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  This is kind of the how's your news intro.  Listen to this.  And I think one of them speaks to James Carvel for a little bit.  Is this the girl?  Yeah.  She's, uh, like, three feet tall in a wheelchair.  Is she in a wheelchair?  No?  No, no.  This one is...  She...  Her head's kind of like this, and she kind of always looks out.  She's got this bent neck.  She's always looking up.  But she's only...  She's only about three, four feet tall.  Yeah.  All right.  Excuse me, Mr. Carvel?  Yes, dear.  How do you feel about a news program being hosted by people with disabilities? 
[00:45:00]  A new program hosted by people with disabilities?  News.  That would be great.  Well...  Have any?  I think people with disabilities make an enormous contribution to this.  Well, that's exactly what we're doing here.  We're shooting for a Man on the Street news documentary of our own that we're calling How's Your News.  Well, good.  You know, I have to...  Hello, and welcome to How's Your News Convention Coverage 2004.  My name is Susan Harrington, and I'm a woman with disabilities who loves her life. 
[00:45:30]  And I'm very excited to tell you all about this unique project we call How's Your News.  All right.  Thank you very much, Alan.  Well, thank you for honoring me by talking to me about this.  Thank you.  Anytime you want me on, you just let me know, sweetheart.  All right.  You know, he wants to say something.  That guy very opinionated.  Well, thank you for honoring me by talking to me.  Yeah.  Sure.  That's what you were thinking.  That's exactly what you were thinking.  All right.  And, hey, sir, let it be known that the feeling is mutual, okay? 
[00:46:00]  All right.  I like that to this program.  How's Your News is a news team made up of people with various disabilities.  We all met at a summer camp many years ago, and it was at this camp that we came up with  the idea of making our very own version of the news.  One time at Retard Camp?  First, we got together with some counselors from the camp, and we selected a crack team  of six outgoing reporters. 
[00:46:30]  Here they are.  This is Bobby.  Most of the time, we can't understand what he's saying, but he does understand us.  And, hey, he always seems to get the scoop.  We just work here.  We just work here.  I'm sorry.  If you're not laughing at that.  Hilarious.  If you're not laughing at that, what, you're probably a decent human being?  Yes.  With all the compassion? 
[00:47:00]  The guy's like, we just work here, man.  This here is Larry.  Like Bobby, he understands everything which is said to him.  But since he can't talk, we've made a board with four questions on it, and he uses the  mic to point out the one he wants to ask.  And this is...  What was that?  Ah!  Wait a minute.  Oh, God.  Hold on.  Here we go. 
[00:47:30]  ...and he uses the mic to point out the one he wants to ask.  I recognize that he either asked about paramilitary operations in Iraq, or he shit his pants.  This is Sean Costello.  He is known for having a pretty subtle sense of humor.  Hey, I bet.  What?  Dude, why'd you give that look?  Dude.  No, because this is a serious story.  It's a turn away.  Jeremy here is 18 years old.  He's got a lot of energy and curiosity. 
[00:48:00]  And he sure doesn't like to stay on one subject for very long.  And ask his forgiveness, and stop that practice.  Do you have any favorite bands that you listen to?  And then there's Ronnie.  He loves celebrities, especially celebrities from the 1970s.  B.J. Honeycutt.  How the hell are you?  Yeah.  How you doing?  Good.  How's Alan Alda doing?  Tonight, you are very lucky, because you have tuned in to our most exciting adventure today. 
[00:48:30]  That's right, Susan.  Can you believe it?  This crew is going to the Democrat and Republican conventions.  We're certainly not your typical news team.  But hey, maybe that's what this election needs, is a little sense of humor.  Get ready for something completely different, ladies and gentlemen.  It's time for How's Your News.  Oh, brother.  Oh, brother. 
[00:49:00]  He's the funny one, I guess.  He's the one with retard strength.  When he sees a celebrity, he runs over, and he kind of grabs them and locks them in so  they can't move.  All right, let's go to the second clip.  How's your news, Anthony?  This is Peter Jennings, right?  Yeah.  Okay, sir.  What's your name?  My name is Susan Harrington, and I'm one of the reporters.  Hi, Susan.  Mine's Peter Jennings.  I work for ABC.  It's nice to meet you.  Nice to meet you.  How do you feel about being here at the convention?  I feel excited. 
[00:49:30]  Do you feel excited about being here?  I think the excitement you're feeling is a two-way street.  I think if I had your voice and your charm, I'd get better ratings at night.  You fraudulent Canadian jizzbag.  You would get more ratings because it would be a complete freak show.  Imagine him sitting there, Peter Jennings looking like he does, and going,  Hi, it's Peter Jennings with the news.  I'd start watching the news again every night.  Everyone would watch.  Are you kidding me?  So he's absolutely right. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, yes.  You hear how he all of a sudden was like, yeah.  And what's your name?  I would, what's your name?  Hmm.  Because if you don't tell me, I'll just think of you as drooling idiots.  Ugh.  Bunch of corkies.  How nice to see you.  Thank you.  Well, thank you very much.  In the meantime, live from the floor of the Democratic Convention,  this is Susan Harrington reporting live for How's Your News.  I want to know why she laughed. 
[00:50:30]  Did he tickle her clit with a pig's foot?  Coming up, see what Hillary Clinton says when Sean and Larry catch up with her.  Oh, please don't change the dial to CBS or anything like that.  Just stay tuned.  Well said.  Did I hear him say butt?  All right.  Jesus, come on.  Ugh.  They caught up with Al Franken in this clip. 
[00:51:00]  Who's the retard in this clip?  I shot.  I shot.  I shot.  I put it on.  You know, I didn't understand that.  I'm sorry.  I shot.  I shot.  I shot.  I shot.  I shot.  I shot.  I shot.  I shot.  I shot.  I shot.  I shot.  I shot.  I shot.  I shot.  I shot.  I shot.  All righty.  Yeah.  I'm Al Franken and I'm recovering at this convention.  Yeah.  And how are you?  Are you having a good time?  I am.  Who have you talked to so far?  I shot.  Bouillon.  Bouillon.  Maya.  Maya. 
[00:51:30]  You know, I couldn't agree more.  Maya.  Yeah.  It was really nice talking to you.  I'm glad you're here.  I think it's fabulous.  Can I shake your hand?  Yeah.  Thanks a lot.  Thank you very much.  What's he saying? 
[00:52:00]  Okay, have a good time.  What's he saying?  He's so uncomfortable in that clip.  What is that?  I don't know.  I wonder what he was trying to say.  Maybe someone out there speaks retard.  God damn how frustrating that must be.  Because I think the girl was saying that he can think, but he just can't talk.  Right.  So he's trying to ask him something.  It's a horrible position to be in, too, because you know the camera's right on Al Franken.  Like in his mind, it's probably like, oh, you asked, you know, hey, Al Franken, you asshole liberal.  And it comes out, ah, bah, bah, ah, bah, bah. 
[00:52:30]  Well, no, if he's a complete retard, he's probably telling Al Franken, I agree completely with your political beliefs.  All right, here's Triumph, the insult comic dog.  Oh, ooh.  What's your name?  What, Triumph, the insult comic dog?  Oh, come tell me dog, huh?  Yes.  Oh, what do you do, comic dog?  What am I doing?  Yeah, what do you do?  You know, I'm here to do what all the reporters are doing, you know, ask questions about the issues, sniff their butts, hump their legs, that kind of thing. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, wow.  Yes.  Oh, you could tell he was thrown.  He was a little thrown.  He wasn't thrown.  He wasn't, that was.  If he had any balls, he would have attacked that dumbbell right there.  Thank you.  Why not?  Why not?  That's great.  You have great chromosomes for me to poop on. 
[00:53:30]  That's great.  Where's your mother, the one pregnant, drinking and smoking?  So, at what trimester did your father punch your mother in the stomach?  Look at your hair cut.  My hair do is better around my asshole.  I'd rather have a conversation with the cigar in my mouth. 
[00:54:00]  Look at your head.  It's huge.  You look like a boxer.  I've looked at the smaller heads humping a great dame from behind.  That is a huge head.  Oh, my God.  This show is awful.  He lost his balls.  He did.  He didn't go after him.  He was all, ah, yes, we're here to cover the election. 
[00:54:30]  I believe he was neutered.  Your parents should have been spayed and neutered to keep freaks like you from walking the earth.  The way you stand there like a stump, I was going to pee on you.  I mistook you for a tree.  Then I realized a tree is smarter.  Pete Rose called.  He wants his hair cut. 
[00:55:00]  And he's bedding five to one.  You're not even human.  Oh, man.  We have time maybe for like one or two more of these.  Hi, this is Ronnie Simonson.  Today I'm interviewing the meathead.  All in the family.  And, of course, we're here to sing that sing song.  And today...  Oh, can you stop for a second?  First of all, Rob Reiner does not want to be called the meathead. 
[00:55:30]  No.  Ever.  The guy is now a director.  He, you know, he was the meathead on All in the Family.  But you don't want to be called that after you've moved on for 40 years or whatever it's been.  And here he comes.  He's got to...  You know, if anyone else called a meathead, he wouldn't give him the time of day and would walk away.  But here he's a retarded.  So he's got to entertain this guy.  Hi, this is Ronnie Simonson.  Today I'm interviewing the meathead.  All in the family.  And, of course, we're here to sing that sing song. 
[00:56:00]  And today...  Boy, the way, Glenn...  And you know what you were then.  Girls were girls and men were men.  Mister, we could use a Democrat party like Kerry again.  Oh, God.  Mister, we could use a hanger if your mother gets pregnant again.  Oh, my God. 
[00:56:30]  You asshole.  Oh, my God.  I'm drooling like a retard 
[00:57:00]  oh god  that got me  that'll be a promo  I hear a new Jimmy sing  I just can't help  I just can't help I laughed  you made me cry  do we have time for one more  we need to go late today  is that possible  I don't even know if the system is set up 
[00:57:30]  listen to Wolf Blitzer being a dick  to the kid  when Kerry gets elected  what would you like to see  Kerry and Edwards change  as far as changes to them in this country  you're pretty positive  that they're going to be elected are you  because you know there's another side  the Republicans they want to get elected too  oh I know but right now I'm just thinking  I think you meant to say if they get elected  right if and when  yeah  well you keep saying when  you don't know for sure they're going to get elected 
[00:58:00]  right but I'm saying if  I meant to say if and when  if they get elected  yeah  because the Republicans might get elected  we don't know  the election's very close  that's true  yeah  so what's the question again  but if and when  Kerry Edwards get elected  what would you like to see them change  he was brutal with her  what's the question  you're retarded  I like Wolf  yeah right  the only one that actually stood up to those retards  how many times have I said it's stupid

[01:07:00]  thank you very much  and embody everything that the holidays are about  i agree with you on in that aspect  on the other hand we have travis  who's just a little dick  that's not nice  yes  dot com  that's kind of funny  um this next bit is a another example  of a bad guest on the opium anthony show  oh i thought you were gonna say of a thing that is funny  oh that is another one of those too 
[01:07:30]  um this guy apparently does a did a one-man star wars show  ah yes  and we get to hear the very first  steve from yellowstone call  oh  and the birth  of people saying  ramon  except  not really the birth of people saying that because that was steve's weird character  but in terms of using it as a heckling device  yeah i like when people call in and ask if they can ramon someone  find out why  on the worst of the opium anthony show 
[01:08:00]  it's the worst of opium anthony  let's say hi to charles ross one-man star wars show  hi mister  one-man show  yeah based on star wars based on star wars  it is star wars essentially  it's star wars  that's the definitive star wars  i wouldn't say definitive i would say sort of the bastardization of it  bastardization  where do you do this  uh... well here i'm doing it in new york at the lambs theater  which is 130 west 44th  it's kind of weird man like this is a comedy sketch that went really really wrong  isn't it like  broadway over there  yeah it is 
[01:08:30]  well it's considered off-broadway  off-broadway  i'm definitely the most off thing on broadway  there's there's no way you're playing this is an off-broadway show you're doing  yeah  well i mean i got my license jesus and stuff like that so i mean i don't i don't feel too  bad about it  can you um... do it for us  uh... the whole thing or just a piece of it  how long is it  that's an hour  well we got about an hour left of the show  can you cut it to 54  i could do it but i'd sweat all over the place and be positively disgusting  what exactly is the theme of the show like  well okay imagine you just take you know star wars and take all the tech out of it 
[01:09:00]  so it's just me doing like all the voices all the like the music and stuff  it's it's kind of a dumb idea and it kind of is dumb for the first five minutes but you  i think people kind of dig it because people know star wars pretty well  do you get a lot of geeks in there  oh man uh... yeah for sure there's a high geek sort of concentration  do you use props no  it's just you and your voice  yeah it's a really stupid idea  but i mean i thought i will not argue with you  way to get people to buy tickets  do you have music that plays  no  it's just you 
[01:09:30]  do you use a microphone or do you yell  yeah i do use a microphone  you want a mic  yeah well i've played it for like  what do you wear  3500 people just uh...  underneath  underneath i wear a killer  you wear uh... just regular clothes or is it  no no it's uh... like a  like a person that uh... would work on an airplane like a flight suit type  oh just something really bad but it's black  it's supposed to be really neutral and um...  yeah what once again i never thought this idea would work but that was about three years  ago and i've been doing it ever since  and who came up to you and said this can be off broadway 
[01:10:00]  nobody nobody it was actually i met this guy uh... when i was touring it on this thing the fringe tour which i mean there's american cities that do the fringe and there's a canadian cities i'm from canada and uh...  and uh... and now it makes perfect  now it makes perfect sense  now i was thinking like wait wait this is a little odd  canada was something in the water  right  so do you feel like you're you've seen the new ones right  yeah  i've seen some of the old ones and my friend watched the new ones  yeah and he thinks that a lot of the technology and stuff 
[01:10:30]  uh...  it's kind of  he surpassed a lot of what lucas originally intended to be you know like his whole thing  like that space sort of cowboy western thing  well um...  eh  well i don't know man i think the new things are made for new new kids like you know they're just made to  they sell toys they get the kids to come out you know they're sort of the helium infused weird little character  i know it's they're not they're not up my alley but when i was a kid and watch the old star wars films 
[01:11:00]  so you were a big fan  oh well when i was a kid yeah absolutely right  what was your favorite part of the uh... original  the original  yeah oh man  there was too many parts actually i really like the evil guy the uh... the emperor  i mean i thought he was sort of like  oh really  well he's like the perfect  not many people pick that  really  that guy  i thought he was just like the perfect sarcastic bastard and he was perfect  usually vader or you know  yeah i don't know he was cool but uh...  you know it's kinda kinda hard to believe that um...  you know a guy with a voice that cool could have given or been sort of the seed of of luke  you know the little whiny 
[01:11:30]  yeah and i  he whined through the entire uh... movie  but if you watch the old film or the new films now you can see how much the canadian guy who plays  anakin skywalker  yeah he's a whiny bastard too  what uh... now obviously you were a big fan because you you must have done the impressions  yeah  do you do the good impressions of this  i wouldn't say there are good impressions but some of them are good impressions  some of them aren't so good like yoda sucks but um... whereas uh... admiral ackbar do you know what i'm talking about  yeah the fish eye  yeah that's him yeah  yeah i mean i do a pretty good version of that which is kinda cool because today i got an audition for um... 
[01:12:00]  a star wars video game  oh wow  only through being in new york could you possibly get an audition to do like a star wars video game  absolutely  where they actually need an admiral ackbar  and what about some of the sound effects uh... obviously the lightsaber would be a big one  i mean it sounds really dumb but it sounds kinda cool  but the point is that you get into the context of the show right and like how's it gonna work  is it gonna work or not gonna work  and um... i mean i can give you guys like a two minute bit  from the show if you want  absolutely i'd love to hear it  okay this here is the trash compactor scene 
[01:12:30]  from the first film  and just bear with me  should i watch or kind of shut my eyes and imagine  oh let's all imagine  you want us all imagine  okay audience  you want to stand up  even if you're driving  shut your eyes  no  let's see here i'll stand up  can i move the microphone  yeah you should stand up  oh yeah  and of course we want uh... the listeners to comment  serious comments about uh...  serious  yes  we got a lot of clowns that uh...

[01:15:30]  you just rattle it out  well  i mean there's a little bit of break  yeah  i don't know  how much of the  you do the entire  movie  well i mean it's like the it's the readers digest version  it's like been really super condensed down  yeah  and i do lord of the rings as well  which is just  dumb  but anyway  it works  wow  yeah you will okay but  okay there's this big big giant dork convention  uh... star wars convention called  celebration 3  which happened in indianapolis and  you get thirty five hundred people  watching this show 
[01:16:00]  at a time  yeah  really really strange  i don't know man  i don't doubt it  wow  i mean like movie screens on the other side of the audience  or on the other side of the stage and then out over the audience  and  you'd never think that there could be that many people that know star wars that well  and what's the reaction as you're doing it  are they laughing  oh yeah for sure  for sure  and they're watching  for some people  for some people it's just like  it's like watching a kid in the basement or something like that  for other people it's about  being able to sort of celebrate their own personal infatuation with star wars you know  yeah 
[01:16:30]  so it's uh... you either find people that  really are laughing at it  and other people that are laughing sort of with you  so yeah it's really strange to have  wow  well you've taken something and uh...  and ran with it  yeah that that  uh...  congratulations  cheers thank you  and best of luck to you  well we got your one man show  we got uh... we got some phone calls coming in  we have jimmy robertson on the phone  uh... jimmy  hey this is jimmy from new jersey  hey jimmy what's up man  hey um... 
[01:17:00]  do you do this scene i like this scene in star wars  when um... when he like have the fight and then there's just the empty robe with no one in it  yeah  yeah  do you do that one  yeah  do you do the robert reed version  were you gonna even die  yeah  you stink  hey serious calls only you asshole  this is what happens now  we get a guest on the show  this is textbook  get a guest on the show  and people call up and no matter how much we tell them we just want serious calls  the assholes get through 
[01:17:30]  you stink  do you get a lot of criticism  your ass stinks  do you get a lot of criticism  she's a lot of criticism  and that's really highbrow criticism man  yeah  that's that's amazing  yeah i mean i'm crushed that the thing is that i think based upon that kind of a phone call  i'm pretty much you know resolved not to do the show anymore  yeah yeah  well i'm sure that guy was out that was the last time guys you're gonna hear it  they're sitting in his apartment uh... probably getting prostitutes at night to piss on him  well let's say hi to dr frank davis uh... dr frank davis  hey how you doing guys 
[01:18:00]  all right i'm a doctor at bellevue psychiatrist  yeah  listen just keep him distracted we're sending a few guys dancing at him  you stink you nut job  thank you  let's say hi to  let's say hi to  let's go to ben in boston ben  uh...  you like that on that band  he can't even see where the falcon goes to pick up tom brady all the code  seems to be doing his own one-man show all day long  i think this guy enjoyed it 
[01:18:30]  uh...  ben from boston  holy man i gotta get there to boston  yeah  any ideas uh... maybe taking it on the road  it's been on the road for the last three years man  really  so you're not just here in uh... new york you'll be going other places no i  there's this thing called clear channel which we i'm sure we're all aware of  yes everybody is aware of  i'm going to uh... at least with the lord of the ring show i'm going to be going to  south africa and  singapore you're shitting me  is there good money in this 
[01:19:00]  i haven't had another job for the last four years man  have you had to pay a lucas anything  oh yeah i mean the rights  you get a proper licensing agreement  if you don't do that you can you know  yeah that'll cost you  so i mean it's it's weird  i really never intended for the show to go as it has  and i'm really glad that it has  what was it just kind of a hobby  no it was a i mean i was working as an actor  one day like literally we i wrote this  comedy sketch  and when i say it went really wrong and went really really right or really really 
[01:19:30]  wrong because  i didn't think people be able to sort of keep up with it  right and people have been able to keep up with it so  this is kind of  almost left  my own hands  i find myself here  not intending to come here to new york  yeah bring this year  but you know it's uh... you know kind of go bigger or go back home  and i mean i'm i don't have a problem doing it and  gonna franchise it out no i don't think so  some other actors to do it you just sit home and pocket some cash  that would be nice but i think the job of the hut and lose my leg  that's it 
[01:20:00]  why don't we uh... go to steve in uh... yellowstone  steve in yellowstone  steve  uh... hi i wanted to know if you had any type of a copyright problem when you were dealing with jork lucas like i've had some times on my website  uh... yeah i mean it is a copyright problem because it is uh... you know a matter of  bring me someone with talent  what the fuck are you talking about you fucking retard  yeah  have fun in yellowstone buddy  maybe you can sit on like you know uh... the old faithful and have it go up your ass you stupid piece of shit 
[01:20:30]  wow man  i'm absolutely you know crushed down to my very foundations man  just don't this is amazing  alright thank you steve in yellowstone  hey man  a guy is successful taking something and using his talent to get out on stage and actually do it  and did you uh... uh... you've been an actor you said uh...  yeah yeah i mean uh...  so now you're finally doing something that's working  you're making my end and people just can't seem to uh... deal with that 
[01:21:00]  steve  well at least not the people that are calling in here god man  no i think it's pretty impressive  steve  something  uh... uh... no no i that's fine actually uh... i mean not many of the scenes from the show really work  purely on on radio like because a lot of it doesn't really all stick together but i mean like  you get something like you know  ho ho ho ho ho  she became a galba walpa  kawawuki  ho ho ho ho ho ho  which is obviously you know  jabba  no it's princess leia  but uh... you know  of course 
[01:21:30]  yeah  i mean there's scenes that people definitely recognize and there's characters like  you know people recognize right  yes  of course  yeah  but um...  yeah uh... it's weird man like you kinda get you kinda have to see it on stage  in order to really get the the full idea that's why it's a stage show and you don't have a cd out  do you have a cd out  no it's not a cd or a dvd  and that's another thing man like if uh...  it's a weird thing with you know copyright material you know  you can only do this in one medium live like that if you wanted to put a cd out you'd have to 
[01:22:00]  pay lucas more money  uh... yeah i don't think i could ever get the rights to do it  no no not really and that's okay i mean it's something i wouldn't want to franchise out because  as long as i can do it i'll continue doing it  right  and i hopefully will not be a sixty five year old man you know like the one man star wars trilogy  you know like nattering on stage to be a little rough listen to the screams of a person in yellowstone national park  sounds like you need some powerful lungs  that guy was just an ass  oh well  uh... so what are the what are the details the shows here in new york right it is indeed

[01:28:30]  Yeah, let's get him back on the phone.  What happened?  Are you kidding?  Why'd he hang up on us?  Eric, why'd he...  Yeah, the phone must have cut out or something.  Ah, damn it.  All right.  Hold on.  That wasn't me hanging up.  No, all right.  We thought, because right when that happened, we were like, uh-oh, he's pissed.  Yeah, we don't want...  No, we don't want you going away mad, and we want to give you the final word here.  So, uh, Charles.  Yeah, yeah, I know. 
[01:29:00]  Charles, so what were you saying?  Um, I don't know what I was saying.  I guess it's just, you know...  You're saying you were feeling sick or something like that, and it's just about...  Oh, man, I mean, okay, I had to do, like, two shows yesterday, and it was, like, wolfing  between the shows.  I don't know.  Everybody's got some kind of cold that's on, sorry.  No, it was something about an uphill battle, and...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you're easy to get to, and you're working on that or something like that?  What's that?  You said something about, and the thought kind of got cut off, that you're easy to kick  in the balls to get to, and you feel like it's an uphill battle.  Try, try doing this type of show here, right? 
[01:29:30]  And, like, you know, sometimes trying to maintain a sense of, like, feeling good about yourself.  You know, it's such a strange thing to be doing, because, like...  I can't be part of this.  This show stinks.  You feel good about yourself.  You know, that's hard sometimes. 
[01:30:00]  It's just click, and right now, Eric is trying to explain why it once again cut off, and  why the mouthpiece smells like the inside of a baby coffin.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Breathe.  Nope.  All right.  Oh!  Oh, my God. 
[01:30:30]  Eric, what happened?  He came back in.  He followed me, and he wants to come back in.  Oh.  Then we've moved.  All right.  No, no, no, let me get out of the studio first, because I've got to call him again.  Yeah.  Um, you can tell him I want to.  No, keep his hand loose.  I know.  Where's Ben?  Ben's in the back.  Dude.  What the hell is going on?  Oh, jeez.  There he is. 
[01:31:00]  I don't know what's going on with the phone.  Were you in the elevator area?  No, I was going to the bathroom.  Oh, no, that...  No.  Why?  No, it's not you guys at all, man.  Yeah, I've had...  On my days off, I got to look after my girlfriend and our two friends that came from Victoria to  visit us, and they were puking, like, lying down on, like, the couch and on the bed, just  barfing in bags and stuff, so...  What's Victoria?  Canada?  Yeah, British Columbia.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Where are you from up there?  Victoria.  Victoria?  No, I live in Victoria, but, I mean, I was born in this place called Prince George, 
[01:31:30]  B.C., which...  Did you ever see the movie Strange Brew?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, with Rick Moran.  That's all we know of Canada is through Strange Brew.  Strange Brew.  Well, it was filmed in Prince George, B.C.  That's where I was born and where I kind of grew up until I was, like, 11 years old or  something.  And I watched...  Oh, thank you.  I'm not sure if they ever told you, but I watched the Star Wars trilogy, like, over  400 times before I was 11 years old.  Oh, you did?  Mm-hmm.  Why?  It was just your thing.  We didn't have television.  We had a television. 
[01:32:00]  We had a VCR.  But we didn't have cable.  That was very cool when you were a kid.  I mean, I watched that movie, I can't even tell you how many times, too.  As a kid?  I mean, sitting there, you had the opening scene, first time you ever saw it?  Yeah.  It was the best thing ever.  Yeah, I know.  Of course.  But, I mean, I put it on, like, sort of as background noise.  Do you know what I mean?  Really?  In the morning.  Just...  Wait, you just had no TV?  Did you get the whole movie memorized?  Uh, no.  Word for word, no?  I doubt it.  I doubt it.  I mean, when I wrote this, though, it was going from memory rather than going back and watching  the films and trying to draw stuff out.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So, there could be some inaccuracies. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, huge inaccuracies.  And you get people telling me that I've got this wrong or that wording wrong or something  wrong, and it's like, well, who cares?  They're probably dressed like Jedi with lightsabers in their hands when they tell you this.  Oh, yeah, man.  I've met a lot of those people.  You've been to the conventions?  Well, just to perform.  I've never actually been to a convention outside of a...  Scary people.  Well, some, but a lot of these people have really normal jobs and normal lives, too,  right?  Like, they just, they do normal things, except that this is their hobby.  So...  Well, you've got a lot of action on the phones.  I mean, they're just going crazy.  Oh, great. 
[01:33:00]  We've got a call coming in from Riskless, Montana.  Well, let's do it.  This is Travis.  Travis!  Hey, dude, why are they giving you such a hard time?  I thought it was pretty good when you did.  Oh, thanks.  Good.  Yeah, there you go.  See, that's positive.  I told you.  I'm a fan of the movie.  I mean, it's hard to find somebody that kind of knows everything about the movie, and everybody  thinks I'm a geek, but I like the movie.  Well, there's nothing wrong with that.  People think I'm a geek, too.  How old were you when you started, like, watching the movies and stuff?  How old was I?  You said he saw the movie 400 times before he was 11, I think.  Before I was 11.  First time I saw it was in Waikiki. 
[01:33:30]  We used to live between Waikiki and Prince George, so the first time I saw it was near the  Waikiki Banyan, if you've ever been to Waikiki.  Ramone!  What?  What?  Did you just squeal?  Ramone!  Oh, it's this guy again.  Did you just squeal off the road again, buddy?  Ramone!  Is this Steve?  Oh, this guy's got to talk.  Ramone!  This guy sucks fucking dick.  Why do the screeners...  No, this guy tricked us. 
[01:34:00]  The screeners can't find out that that's not Travis.  Ramone!  Star Wars is the faggot.  All right, we get it.  Ramone!  Tell this guy...  Steve!  Talk!  Steve, please lose the phone number.  Where do you live, man?  Ramone!  Tell this faggot that Wookie is unreal.  Holy shit, dude.  The guy's cracking himself up.  This is awesome. 
[01:34:30]  All right, Steve.  Do you want my home number, fuckhead?  Really?  You know, they're faceless people.  I love it.  Like message board people.  Ramone!  They love joking and bashing, but they never want to confront anybody.  Come down to the studio.  We'll kick your ass.  Why don't you come in the studio, buddy?  Steve.  Enough.  Go find your boyfriend, Ramone, or whatever the hell.  Why don't you come in the studio?  Dead balls. 
[01:35:00]  All right, there he goes.  Jesus.  Sorry about that, buddy.  It's a daily battle on this show to deal with these assholes.  Brian Clifton, what's up?  Hey, this is Brian from Clifton Park.  Hey, Brian.  I saw them at Celebration 3.  I loved them.  I really did.  Okay.  All this crap they're giving you is a bunch of bullshit.  Saw the show?  You're very talented.  I love the films.  You know, what people do, and it's a great film, and I can't believe that people are dissing  them like this.  It's a bunch of jack-offs. 
[01:35:30]  You're always going to get it.  Just keep doing what you're doing.  I saw it at Celebration 3.  Keep it up.  I'm punching out.  You're always going to get the one or two.  That's what they call the bad apples.  So what is with Ramone?  I don't get it.  Every time this Steve guy calls, it's always about Ramone.  We still don't know what it means.  But he actually listens to the radio and then bothers to call in.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what he does.  He actually listens and then calls in to Bash.  Because you're sort of a village idiot, but sort of... 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, every day.  Every day.  Every day.  Every day we've got to deal with this shit.  Ramone.  Ramone.  Who cares, Ramone?  Uh, Dan in New Hampshire checking in.  Let's say hi to Liddy.  Liddy!  Hey, how are you doing?  Hello?  Liddy.  What's up, Liddy?  Hey, why is it breaking this guy out of a heart?  Liddy, you stink.  Ramone.  All right.  We're going to get it. 
[01:36:30]  Ramone.  Darth Vader has AIDS.  Holy shit, dude.  Stop.  Would you...  Why do you call?  Ramone, T-3PO should be molested.  Wash my balls.  He's got an...  He's Liddy.  Liddy and Ramone?  Like, what the hell?  Liddy.  This is Liddy.  Ramone.  Ramone is going to be an awful producer.  He needs a writer, obviously. 
[01:37:00]  We've got no material, dude.  Ramone.  Why are Ryan says hiring that lazy bag of shit?  I don't even know what he's talking about.  All right.  Wow.  Thank you, Liddy.  Goddamn.  So he's like an honorary DJ or like on the...  Honorary?  The Eye in the Sky or something like that?  Yeah.  For some reason, he's very good at getting past the screeners.  Let's go to the Ramone part.  Any more Steve from Yellowstone calls and you guys are done. 
[01:37:30]  I mean, Jesus.  Check the caller ID.  Yeah.  Don't we have caller ID?  Ben, what's up?  Yo, what's up?  I want him to do Yoda eating Princess Lady's ass.  Ramone.  No, this is not Ramone.  Is this somebody totally new?  Yeah, do you do that, though?  Seriously, if you do all the voices, do you mess around with the voices a little bit?  No, not really.  Do alternate scenes?  Well, no eating of Leia's ass.  No.  But that would be great.  Any other movies that you have in mind to take into this? 
[01:38:00]  I was thinking of Terms of Endearment, maybe.  Terms of Endearment.  That would be great.  How about Blowing Chewbacca?  Blowing Chewbacca.  Look at the size of that thing.  I think Star Wars, The Wrath of Khan.  Star Trek, The Wrath of Khan would probably be a good one.  Good choice.  Sonny Ferelli, what's up?  Hey, this guy's really good, man.  Oh.  Ramone.  All right.  Yeah, you know something?  Your book is doing an excellent job.  What's his name, Ramone?  Punching out.  That's not even Steve. 
[01:38:30]  I don't even get that one.  All right, Frenchie.  Hey, this guy is very good.  Why is everybody giving him shit?  Ramone.  Is that the real Frenchie?  Yes.  And you like it?  Yes, I like him.  He's good.  Okay.  He does a good job.  Come to my restaurant.  Oh, plug your restaurant.  Ramone, this guy sucks.  Ramone.  Ramone, bring this guy.  It's self-inflicted gunshot wound. 
[01:39:00]  All right, plug.  Ramone.  I've had it.  I have had it.  Bring me a hybrid vehicle.  You really got to bring this guy on, man.  Bring me a belly the size of a change purse.  Jesus Christ.  Look.  Shave my arms. 
[01:39:30]  All right.  Thank you, Frenchie.  Shave my arms.  Thank you, Frenchie.  All right, thanks.  Jesus.  All right, well, Charles.  Charles Ross.  Charles, again.  Man, Star Wars show.  Again, thank you very much.  Also, I believe in the new year, we're going to be opening up the one-man Lord of the Rings,  probably in the same space as well.  Right here in New York.  Yeah, yeah.  Very cool.  So, uh...  Could you give us a little taste of that?  Ah, sure.  We wants it.  We needs it.  Must have the precious.  Master is our friend.  You don't have any friends. 
[01:40:00]  Nobody likes you.  I'm not listening.  You're a liar and a thief.  Nope.  Murderer.  I hate you.  Where are you with me?  Him.  Him.  It was me.  We survived because of me.  Not anymore.  What?  We don't need you.  Leave now and never come back.  Leave now and never come back. 
[01:40:30]  Anyway.  Wow.  That's pretty damn good.  No, no more chips done at me, though.  This is good.  That's...  Well, it's really cool, though.  The guy who played Gandalf, Ian McKellum, came and saw the show when I did it.  Really?  Yeah, it was weird.  And he actually really liked it.  Yeah, I mean, it's been a really strange thing, man.  Like, getting...  Going from, like, doing just sort of the comedy sketch thing to suddenly playing with the big boys.  Or, you know, having to, like, suddenly be in the scrutiny of Steve. 
[01:41:00]  Of the likes of a Steve from Yellowstone.  That would be a little nerve-wracking, though, having Ian McKellum there.  Yeah, I guess so.  I mean, because he's, like, you know, an actor.  He was in the movie.  Yeah, exactly.  So, you know, if he hated it, then I'd feel, like, crap or just sort of feel worse than sometimes, you know, you do when Steve calls you Ramon or whatever it is.  Yeah, Ramon every goddamn day.  How about The Matrix?  I don't know.  Yeah.  The Matrix would probably work.  It could work.  It's kind of hard to find, like, a show that's that popular.  You know, like, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings is super popular. 
[01:41:30]  But I think Terms of Endearment, if they put out one more, man, it'll be right up there.  Fried green tomatoes.  I was thinking maybe the Muppets.  Madison County.  You bet.  That's a good one.  What's up, Jimmy?  Did he get the...  Yeah, he's getting the auction stuff altogether.  Yeah, okay.  Cool.  Very good.  All right, we're going to say goodbye to Charles.  I'm going to have to bring another stuff in, though, which I will bring in, the stuff from the New York City, which I can bring in.  Yeah, right on.  All right.  Charles did a great job for us today.  Thanks so much.  Feel better.  All right, I will.  I hope so.  All right.  Cheers.  See you.  It's the worst.  The worst.  We'll be back with more of the worst of Opie and Anthony featuring Nathaniel. 
[01:42:00]  Lady like it.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The worst.  It's the worst.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  The worst.  With Nathaniel.  Holy mackerel, am I enjoying that radio program.  Well, this is dated.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:42:30]  But this bit is a year old, but it's still a classic.  It could be several years old by the time you hear this.  Who knows?  You know what you could call it?  What?  An oldie but a goodie.  Because this particular person was not elected to office, but he was a delight to talk to and make fun of on the Opie and Anthony Show.  So it's the one, the only Paul R. Nelson, and we get to hear some of his slanderous ad campaigns that are very, very, very conservative. 
[01:43:00]  And we get to hear his sweet voice, which is like music.  It is.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  No, you're not.  I'm fan, and this is the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  That's better.  Thank you.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Paul R. Johnson.  Yeah.  Nelson.  Nelson.  Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  There it is.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson, hockey dad.  Oh, he's a.  And gook killer. 
[01:43:30]  I'm Paul R. Nelson, hockey dad and.  Hockey dad.  Hockey dad.  I'm Paul R. Nelson, hockey dad and colonizer.  No, not really.  That's, that's a, I liked it better when I fucked it up.  At least I had an excuse.  But then once it came out crystal clear, it just plain old fell flat. 
[01:44:00]  That went over like a lead balloon.  Back goes Griffey, looking up.  And it's out of here.  Or is it?  No, it's off the wall.  My mistake.  That went over like a lead balloon.  I'll keep saying it.  So what's the plug?  So we go home.  Just say, say anything that these two guys said and you'll get Halloween tickets as long  as I got them.  Paul R. Nelson, you want them to say.  Yes.  I'm Paul R. Nelson. 
[01:44:30]  They got to say it in some kind of voice.  They can't just say, I'm Paul R. Nelson.  And you only get one shot.  So if you don't do it.  Yeah.  And you're fucked.  If you walk up like Master Paul, hello, gentlemen, this is Paul R. Nelson.  Hey, I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'll be fucking out back.  Yes.  Paul will fucking up.  Hi, this is Paul R. Nelson.  You vote for Ron Kind, you're going to be Paul.  Paul.  You didn't like that one?  Master Paul.  No.  I didn't hear it.  That was all right. 
[01:45:00]  Damn it.  I'll hear it in the replay.  Oh, Stan.  Wow, I got Stan trying to make him say it again.  All right.  I said, Master Paul will screw it up and come up and go, hi, I'm full R. Nelson.  Oh, because he's into the martial arts.  Yeah.  It's like a physical.  That's a hold.  It's a hold that people use.  Gentlemen.  Gentlemen, gentlemen.  F.H. Reilly's Friday, Saturday, run into Brother Elmo late because he sleeps all day 
[01:45:30]  and he'll have Halloween tickets in his back pocket.  Right?  Yeah, thanks for throwing me under the bus there, pal.  400 New York Avenue, Huntington Village, my bro's place.

[01:55:00]  To...  To...  To what?  Your son...  Is attempting to bring...  Paul R. Nelson.  Into this situation.  Paul R. Nelson?  You make me pop your fucking eye after...  Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R. Nelson. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  Where are we getting at?  Yeah.  Oh, we were.  Oh, my God.  Stupid Paul R. Nelson.  Makes us stay.  Down goes Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R. Nelson.  Teared down that wall.  Oh, that was a damn good one.  Paul R. Nelson would pull an R. Bud Dwyer.  That's enough. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, the listeners stink.  All right.  I think we can go, right?  What do you think?  Yeah.  I think that's a good enough lull where now the moment's over.  Even if you did come up with the next great one.  All right.  Yeah.  Give it a shot. 
[01:56:30]  Hello.  Who's this?  Oh, Big Al Tulsa.  This is the best I've ever heard.  Just tell him.  Awesome show.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right, Big Al.  Let's get to line three.  Call from Paul R. Nelson.  Who's this?  Left the building.  Left the building.  Who are you?  You need the music, though.  Cease it.  All right.  You got to go out on that one.  All right.  Who are you?  Ed Brennan in Wisconsin.  We're not going to vote for Paul R. Nelson.  What's your name?  What's your name?  Brendan.  I'll turn down the radio for a second.  Thank you. 
[01:57:00]  There you go.  You turn down the radio?  Yep, it's up.  All right.  Brendan, the show's yours.  Yeah, take the show.  We'll see you guys Monday.  We're done.  Do whatever you want.  You're on the air.  Paul R. Nelson has left the building.  It's the worst.  It's worth replaying.  It's worth replaying.  Oh, what?  The, uh...  Ron Kind.  Please.  The more Ron Kind ads, the better.  We should have new ones tomorrow, bud. 
[01:57:30]  Please.  And I want to see some of the ones that are against, uh...  You know, the other side of it.  This was earlier today.  Listen to this anti-political ad.  Or negative political ad.  Sorry.  Anti, uh...  Ron Kind ad.  With our servicemen and women facing death every day,  what kind of congressman would try to gut military spending?  The wrong kind.  Ron Kind.  That's right.  Congressman Ron Kind is repeatedly voted to deprive our troops of the funding they need to fight for us.  But Ron Kind has no trouble spending your money. 
[01:58:00]  He would just rather spend it on sex.  That's right.  Instead of spending money on cancer research,  Ron Kind voted to spend your money to study the sex lives of Vietnamese prostitutes.  Instead of spending money to study heart disease,  Ron Kind spent your money to study the masturbation habits of old men.  Ron Kind spent your tax dollars to study something called the  bisexual, transgendered, and two-spirited Aleutian Eskimos, whoever they are.  Ron Kind even spent your tax dollars to pay teenage girls to watch pornographic movies  with probes connected to their genitalia. 
[01:58:30]  Ron Kind pays for sex, but not for soldiers.  If Ron Kind had better priorities, he wouldn't be able to hear this.  Ron Kind is out of touch, and soon he'll be out of Congress.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  And I approve of this message.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Are you, Paul R.?  Sounds like a voice you would do.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  And this ad excited me.  It sounds like Frank the Frowner.  It certainly does.  Ripping you off.  Ooh.  I don't like Paul R. Nelson. 
[01:59:00]  We used to argue frequently.  He went into the Marine Corps, and I jerked somebody off in the rest area.  You know, I read a little bit about that study.  Yeah.  And it turns out it was a bill that was involved, like I said, a big sex grant that was supposed  to look at sexual habits to help combat AIDS, other venereal diseases, and gay sexuality, 
[01:59:30]  older people, and what they have to go through as they get older, involving their sex lives.  So it was a whole study.  On human sexuality.  On human sexuality that they picked out.  And the women, there's nothing in the report that talks about teen girls.  Nothing.  It says women were tested during viewing of pornographic movies or erotic films.  Nothing about teen women.  This is all, like, picked apart like these were separate little things that he's just 
[02:00:00]  doling out tax dollars for.  Soldiers need money.  Well, I want to know what bisexual Eskimos do, so fuck the soldiers.  That's what they made it seem like he's doing.  Yeah.  And Ron Kine doesn't behave that way.  We all know it.  Ron Kine.  Can we hear the other guy's voice one more time?  And by the way, it was like a 50-50 split on the vote.  I think it just didn't pass.  But it was something like 210 votes were for it.  Yeah.  So it really was one of those fake ads. 
[02:00:30]  Here's that guy's voice again at the end.  I love this guy.  With our servicemen and women.  I actually.  If Ron Kine had better priorities, you wouldn't be having to hear this.  Ron Kine is out of touch, and soon he'll be out of Congress.  I'm Paul R. Nelson, and I approve of this message.  Oh, please, can we play that all the time?  All day tomorrow.  Remind us.  I just want.  You need to hear Paul R. Nelson.  On my machine, I just want him going, I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I don't need the other part of it.  I just want. 
[02:01:00]  Just.  Can you play it and then stop it?  Him just going, I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Hold on.  Hold on.  See if you can swing that.  For the love of God, please.  If Ron Kine had better priorities, you wouldn't be having to hear this.  Ron Kine is out of touch, and soon he'll be out of Congress.  I'm Paul R. Nelson, and I approve of this message.  Oh, you can't.  I have to do it another way.  That's very funny.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  If Ron Kine had better priorities, you wouldn't be having to hear this.  Ron Kine is out of touch, and soon he'll be out of Congress.  I'm Paul R. Nelson. 
[02:01:30]  That's what I want.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Also known as Sam.  Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R. Nelson is a douche.  I would love to just be in Congress for one term and come up with things like,  and then they would just say, like,  Jim Norton voted to rename the United States of America shit cunts.  I would just propose all the stuff that I knew would never get passed.  I would try to make the legal age for sex six months. 
[02:02:00]  And it's actually your ad, and you're just sitting there like, yeah, I did.  I'm proud of it.  That's right.  I did that.  What are you going to do about it?  Jim Norton proposed that we change the age of consent to six months.  I'm Jim Norton, and I approve this ad.  My opponents.  My opponents wanted to feed the homeless.  I said, let's teach women how to make bigger shits so we can laugh at their logs.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  By the way, people are hearing that for the first time. 
[02:02:30]  That commercial wasn't a bit.  No, it's a real commercial.  It's a real commercial.  That was a real commercial that is going on in Wisconsin.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Well, that battle's heating up.  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  Of Opie and Anthony.  Featuring Nathaniel.  It's the worst.  He's reached his potential.  This is as far as he can go.  This is it.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  This next, next, oh, God.  Ooh, pick up.  Next segment. 
[02:03:00]  This next segment, I have no idea what it's about.  I simply know the title of it.  It could be anything, but when the title is simply Master Poe, colon, smells, it's got  to be hilarious.  No, you read that wrong.  It's Master Poe's, colon, smells.  Thank you, Sam, of the Thin and Sam show.  Travis, for laughing.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  I bet he has terrible shits. 
[02:03:30]  Can't afford, like, nice toilet paper.  Oh, jeez.  So his finger's always, like, breaking through the toilet paper.  It's being recorded.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  You know what I gotta realize?  Danny's starting to get really cocky.  Oh, he is.  I really notice.  He is really stepping forward and saying, I ain't taking you guys shit too much longer.  I gotta realize one of the...  Ron and Fez have been calling me and I'm ready to jump ship, so don't give me any bunk.  Well, I do have the biggest dumps around here. 
[02:04:00]  He got a little rambunctious this morning, too.  We needed somebody.  See, it's raining here in New York.  It's been raining for a week straight.  And I do not like walking in the rain.  I don't have an umbrella.  I don't want to get soggy and sit here wet and cold like a little puppy all day.  So I pull up in front of the building and I phone my good friend Steve C.  That's right.  And say, Steve, I will give you the opportunity to drive a real vehicle and take my Escalade to the parking garage. 
[02:04:30]  A real gas guzzler.  Right.  Exactly.  Uses like a year's worth of gas for his car just driving to the garage.  Exactly.  It's nice.  And Steve drives and parks the car.  And how do you get back when that happens?  Sometimes I walk.  Sometimes Poe follows me and drives me back.  Oh, I would hope Poe would because it's raining and I don't want to get wet.  He's been cool about it.  You have to.  He's been cool about it.  So today it's like, I don't know, the fourth day in a row or whatever it is.  It's the whole week.  The fifth day.  I didn't want to bug Steve because he's a busy guy in the mornings. 
[02:05:00]  It's before the show.  He has better things to do than drive my freaking car around.  So I decided to make a decision today that Poe will drive my truck around.  It's a great honor to drive my vehicle to the parking garage.  I'll say.  It is something of trust.  I have confidence in the people that do this.  That is why Steve is one of the only people.  And now Poe has driven my vehicle around.  But now what was needed was Poe to drive it around and someone to drive Poe's car to follow my vehicle so Poe can then drive back from the garage. 
[02:05:30]  So I came up and I was looking for an intern or something to drive Poe's car because quite frankly I don't care who drives Poe's car.  They could drive it into a pole for all I care.  So, you know, grab anybody.  No interns.  It was too early.  So in the office everybody's doing something.  I guess the least important thing that was being done at that time was being done by Danny.  And Danny just started.  So you're saying Danny doesn't work hard for us?  He was going.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. 
[02:06:00]  That's what I heard.  At the time.  If we were doing bit triage in the morning, his patient could have sat there while the other patients were being worked on.  Good way to say it.  This particular morning.  Right.  You might be right.  But there are other mornings where his top priority, you know, sucking chest wound is the bit he's working on.  No, I'm not trying to get out of it.  No, I'm not.  You're trying to make something more of this than I am.  We all know we give Danny the easiest stuff in the morning to do.  So why don't we just bring it to the table now? 
[02:06:30]  Sits at the special ed computer at the end.  The one that doesn't have any real programs on it to do any real work.  Just keep hitting enter over and over.  Yeah, all you hear from that computer is, I'm contributing.  Yes, you are.  I'm contributing to the show.  Because they made us hire a retard.  The reality is it's fun to make.  He really, Danny really works hard for us.  Of course he does.  Sure does.  Photographing his own shit and all. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  I'm producing.  You certainly are.  But he gave a little bit of an attitude this morning.  Like he didn't want to drive post car.  Like it was like, yeah, all right.  Like you could say he's sitting there.  He's got his headphones on.  He's hearing the conversation that's going on that we need somebody to drive.  He's listening.  No one else is coming to the table.  And he's sitting there like, I know it's going to end up on me.  I know.  So then finally when it was like, Danny, you know, drive post car.  He's like, is there a problem with them? 
[02:07:30]  Your duties here?  No, not with the duties.  Duties.  Obviously not.  From the picture I saw.  It's like a fucking plane spelling things.  It looks like an air.  You should be taking shits over Jones Beach.  My dumps, you could easily find, you could find the same thing on Central Park South.  That's a huge area.  But the problem.  Thank you.  I'm getting away with that one. 
[02:08:00]  Wow.  He's trying to add to it in everything.  Cheers.  That's how huge they are.  But seriously.  And then he trods forward.  He wasn't even trying to do comedy.  Yeah, no, seriously, they're big.  I'm not really trying.  Welcome.  I'm just letting you know.  To the bomb reel.  You got that one with anyone?  Yeah.  Central Park, what did you do?  Central Park South?  Shut up, Jimmy.  I'm just trying to figure it out.  Oh!  Oh!  Hey, you're going to take that! 
[02:08:30]  You're going to take that!  Oh, hey!  You got balls!  Sorry.  So, yeah, was there a, there was a problem with, you know, doing that?  No, no, the task is fine.  Yeah.  The task at hand is fine.  But there's a little, there's a slight, Eric is back in the studio.  Yeah.  There's a slight odor problem in Poe's car.  With Poe's car?  What's the odor in your car?  Dead bodies?  Is there an odor in your car? 
[02:09:00]  Have people told you your car stinks?  Steve?  Nah.  Steve has never told me my car stinks.  Smells like dogs.  Well, yeah.  Oh, is that what it is?  Steve's a big pussy.  Steve can't even get in my car.  It takes him about 15 minutes.  There he goes.  If you really want to see how pissed off I can get, why don't you plant one right fucking here?  Ooh.  And when your arm breaks, then.  Well, why does his car smell?  His car smells like dogs.  Yeah.  What dog?  Plant what?  Yeah, plant what?  A fist or kiss? 
[02:09:30]  A smooch.  Because if I'm going to, I'll get an anvil.  I'm not going to use my fist.  Yeah, exactly.  No, well, the big, the big issue is I don't want to fucking club anybody.  I'm going to, I'm going to smash Jimmy in the face for making fun of me verbally.  What?  No, I don't want to do that.  Let's hope not.  But, why is this anger coming out, Steve?  No, it's not.  We're all smashing your children.  Steve, relax.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I don't want to use plant one.  How do I take it?  Because I'm not retaliating physically, I'm a pussy?  I'm afraid.  No one's calling you a pussy. 
[02:10:00]  He just did.  Steve, relax.  He did.  That was the exact word that came out of his mouth.  He called me a pussy.  Hit him.  That's right.  Just because I'm not around here throwing people out windows means I'm a fucking pussy?  That's pretty much what Oprah's saying, and we're all agreeing.  I think I don't agree with that.  Holy jeez.  Poe was the one who called you out, and I was just acknowledging the fact that it sounded  kind of, you know.  No, Poe just said I didn't say anything.  Yeah, but you've been driving his car a lot.  Or how many times?  Every time I've got to park Ant's car.  Then you park his?  No, no, no, no, no.  Then I get a ride back to the studio. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, he's following, and then you've got to ride in it.  Every morning, I follow Steve to park Ant's car, and I bring him back to the studio.  Whether it rains, it doesn't matter.  I want to make sure that he gets back to the studio on time.  Of course.  And he never complained, not once.  No?  Not once.  Well, it's hard.  Not once.  Not a pee.  He laughed because we have the show on.  We talk about, you know.  You don't want to, like, say, you know, it's awkward.  It's embarrassing.  You don't want to sit there and go, wow, your car stinks. 
[02:11:00]  Unless you bring it up, like, immediately.  You can get it and go, whoa, this car stinks.  But after you've driven a while, it kind of builds up.  It's hard to confront somebody.  I don't think he smells it anymore.  I think he's used to it.  Are you, Steve?  Are you, Steve?  What, the dog smell?  Yeah.  I have a dog, so I know what that smell is.  You don't really like it, though, do you?  No, it's not all.  I know what dog smell is.  That's why I'm.  I got in the elevator, and the whole thing smelled like dog liquid.  No one on it.  It's like, when they're wet, it's awful.  Wet dog people with their stupid.  Wet dogs. 
[02:11:30]  Fuck, in the elevator, in their cars.  Exactly.  In your apartments.  In your home.  You're stinking it up.  Your basement.  Can we bring this back around?  Yeah.  First of all, Steve, I'm sorry I called you a pussy.  It's okay.  I don't like the fact that he yelled it up, though, and didn't tell Master Poe that he should plant one.  Plant one.  Oh, if Master Poe hits me, it's going to be a rough fight, because Poe can probably do a number on me, but I'll get some good hits in.  Wow.  Yeah, your head on the floor.  Holy shit.  Maybe. 
[02:12:00]  Maybe.  Or one wrong word from a massive fight in the studio hall.  It really is.  You can feel the tension.  I am so tired of being called a pussy.  I might just fucking-  Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't upset.  Jesus Christ.  I mean, it's like, listen, I don't mean to interrupt you, faggot.  Oh, Jesus, are you fucking kidding?  Can I not talk?  I just-  I wound up a bad man.  He no longer hates me.  That's all I care about.  I was cranky when I came in.  Now he's focused on you.  It's the weather.  I was sweating there for a while.  What?  Oh, he was mad? 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, no, he's a little hot.  He gets a little hot.  He forgot all about me.  He gets a little hot under the slip.  Oh, oh.  But I wound up coming in in a very bad mood, and I think everybody has an odd mood today.  Yeah.  Steve, I have a great fear of you, by the way.  I don't want people to be afraid.  I don't want people to be afraid.  Then I'm not.  Okay.  Whatever you want, that's what I'm offering for you.  When you come in that day with a high-powered rifle and start walking around, I want to be  the guy that you pointed-  I want to be the guy that's interviewed later that said, he pointed it right at me. 
[02:13:00]  He thought about it.  And then smiled, nodded, and walked away and shot Opie right in the head.  I'm not going to shoot Opie.  Like, that's the guy I want to be.  Hold on.  Would I be the first one you shoot?  No.  Why are you saying that?  No, I wouldn't shoot anybody.  If you had to, would I be the first one you shoot?  I wouldn't shoot you.  Oh, God.  In order?  No, if you had to.  You're coming in.  You're the disgruntled employee.  No, no.  You're coming in.  Who you shoot first because you have that much anger toward?  You'd be first if Ben was standing right behind you and he knew he could shoot Ben by shooting 
[02:13:30]  through you.  Because Ben is first on your list.  No, he's not.  Steve's going to give this order.  Who can fire me the least?  Who has the least firing power?  All the interns get shot first.  Okay.  That's actually accurate.  You have a room full of dead interns.  Wouldn't you shoot me first?  No.  Why don't you want to hurt Opie?  Who would you shoot?  Who's first?  Who's first?  See, this is where you get the label of the P word.  You have to at least answer this question.  I'm thinking about it.  Who would you shoot? 
[02:14:00]  What, Pam?  I'm looking around.  Who would you shoot first if you were the disgruntled employee?  I'd shoot Eric first.  Do I have to shoot people?  That's really the only option?  I'll be honest.  I'd shoot Eric first.  If I went completely crazy, came in with a gun, and just everyone was available to shoot,  because you'd probably just shoot the first person you see, you know, kind of make a statement.  But if I looked and everyone was available to shoot, I'd probably just shoot Eric.  Nothing personal.  Just, you're very shootable.  And he's the easiest one to blame, because they go, why'd you do it?  You could just open your mouth, and some reason would fly out that was accurate. 
[02:14:30]  But the CD had the wrong shit on it.  Well, it did happen.  Yeah, yeah.  If I had to go in order of disgruntled employee, and your objective is to wipe out as many of your coworkers as possible.  You don't have to give it that much thought.  Just, you come in, you're angry.  Yeah, because who's the one you're shooting for?  Well, the first person I'm going to see if I walk in with a gun is this guy, is Poe.  It's got to be Poe.  So Poe goes down first.  You have to take him out first.  You've got to take out Poe first.  So you can take out the rest of the office.  So you can take out everybody else.  But it's like, no, it's like a video game. 
[02:15:00]  He's the boss, and he's in that room with the Kevlar and the bulletproof glass,  and you can't access him until you wipe out a few other people and can get to the switch.  Then you're going after stormtroopers, basically.  So you have to go out, and you have to go through a round of them.  Picture Steve there with a fucking rifle and Poe just going, hold on, and then swiping in there.  Who would you shoot first?  Who gets it?  Hmm.  Who gets it?  I guess, you know, it's a toss-up.  If Danny's in the way, Danny takes a bullet.  Danny.  Why Danny?  Why is everybody on me today?  Well, you're in the room. 
[02:15:30]  Everybody?  I just shot Eric.  Yeah, you shot Eric.  Your name didn't even come up.  And I should tell you now that I so considered you first.  Why?  I don't know.  It just popped in my head.  I'm sorry, guys.  I don't mean to mess up this bit, but you won't get through.  What do you mean?  Windows and doors and walls and...  Ugh.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Wow.  That was...  You missed a car crash.  It was a car crash.  Yeah, this dog fur just flew out of the car.  Wow. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  All right, well, that would have been a great bit for another 20 minutes.  Oh, well, we're done with that one.  No, it's all right.  No, it's all right.  It's cool.  So where were we?  Danny?  Danny, right.  Part your car.  But no, no, Danny followed in Poe's car.  Right.  And then they drove back together, and Danny, I guess, had a problem with the fragrance of Poe's car.  It's a little funky.  A little funky.  Is it dog?  I suppose.  Yeah?  I suppose.  I know that Poe does have a few dogs.  What kind of dogs are they? 
[02:16:30]  Three dogs.  What kind?  Bulldogs.  Oh, so they slobber a lot.  Big dog balls.  No?  They're just big.  Big dog balls.  Their tails poke straight up so their assholes rub on the seat.  You don't even get the tail protection.  People are amazing with their fucking dogs.  They hop up on the couch at their house and stuff, and their actual asshole, where the dog shit comes from, is on the couch.  And then people will lay there with their face on the couch where the dog asshole was just, like, rubbing. 
[02:17:00]  It's okay, because it's a dog.  Just put your face on your dog's asshole, because that's what you're doing.  My dogs have their own couch.  Your dogs have their own couch?  Yeah, they have their own couch, yeah.  That's wonderful.  All right.  Fabulous.  We're done with the car thing, because now we've got to get back to the Steve thing, which is the whole thing.  Right.  See where we go here?  See, in the end.  Thank you, gentlemen.  It all comes around.  Bye, Dan.  And then we've got the Jim Norton audio after the break.  Thanks, guys.  Danny, Master Poe.  Hey, guys.  This is Master Poe.  You're listening to the Worst of Master Poe. 
[02:17:30]  If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it.  Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it.  Hoos.  Hoos.  Hoos.  Hoos.  Hoos.  Hoos.  Hoos.  Hoos.  It's the worst.  The worst.  We'll be back with more of the worst of Opie and Anthony, featuring Nathaniel.  Like it. 
[02:18:00]  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the worst.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Featuring Nathaniel.  It's the worst.  He's reached his potential.  This is as far as he can go.  This is it.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, welcome back, everybody.  Thank you.  It's the Christmas Eve edition, or maybe not, if Eric tends to reuse this, of the worst of 
[02:18:30]  the Opie and Anthony Show.  I'm your host, Than.  I'm one of the very fortunate producers of this great radio show, who gets to today pick  his favorite bits.  This one is something I'd like Sam of the Than and Sam Show to maybe comment on.  Hey, Than.  I was just sitting here and heard my name.  Hey, what's up?  Remember that guy, Harry?  Harry T.  Yes.  This is when, I guess, it says Ron and Fez on it, because I know he went on to be a producer 
[02:19:00]  for Ron and Fez.  That's why Eric labels what he labels.  But this particular time is when Harry thought it would be fun to sit in a desk five feet  away from the studio, go on to the internet, and request one of his own bits that he had  submitted.  I remember Harry better than anyone, because Harry was in my original intern class.  Yes, primetime Sam Roberts was once just another intern.  I can't believe it.  And, yeah, I remember, because everybody hated Harry so much. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, yeah.  And then we found out Harry was getting a gig with Ron and Fez.  And you guys were all pissed off, because you were trying to get a break.  I was pissed off, because I was the best intern out of that class.  Definitely better than Harry.  Clayton was in your class, too, right?  All right, second best, because Clayton was old.  But luckily for us, Harry is no longer with us.  But let's...  Do you mean Earth?  No, I was talking about the XM Nation, but... 
[02:20:00]  Your lipstick got ears.  God's ears.  Oh, God, I blew that.  That's an okay thing.  Why don't you just...  Say the worst of the Opie and Anthony show?  Yeah.  Worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hang on.  That is killer, man.  What is it?  Is this true?  It's completely confirmed, and everyone's so excited.  How did...  How did...  Well, someone has to explain.  They're just handing this to us. 
[02:20:30]  Travis, you want in on this?  It's instant feedback.  You know our instant feedback.  It's a great little tool for the show.  People are able to comment on things going on during the show without having to get through on the phone.  And we read them here, and sometimes we read them on the air.  They're very funny.  Sometimes they're just comments to us saying they love the show, they hate the show.  Sometimes they request bits, is what they do.  And I was handed the O&A show live feedback form.  Now, this is a printout of what people who go to instant feedback have to fill out. 
[02:21:00]  First name, last name, email address, from, and then the message.  A max 250 characters, and then send it.  Boink.  Well, this is from Joey, last name, gay, email address, shittdick at AOL.com, from, and it says whackbag.com.  And then it says, I like that Led Zeppelin tribute with Robert Kelly singing lead. 
[02:21:30]  Play the Rob Kelly remix with Zeppelin.  And apparently, our private investigators around the studios here have found out.  We observed that this was being sent from a cubicle here in the XM Studios.  It's coming from inside the studio.  And by observing, they have found that it was indeed Harry T., the new intern, requesting his own material. 
[02:22:00]  Well, trying to request his own shit under an assumed name.  While he's interning.  What are you, while you're interning, you're requesting your own stuff.  I, now, is this, yeah, oh no, I'm, this is true, you're messing up to it.  Yeah, it was, it was more because, towards the end, someone else threw one in, oh, you  played the other Zeppelin one, I'm like, let me see if we can play that one.  No, someone else that didn't write it.  And, um, no, they played another Zeppelin one, some, some other, or you wanted to. 
[02:22:30]  Dude, you're requesting your own material to be played.  No, yeah, I'm talking to it.  We enjoyed it, thought it was really good.  Apparently it hasn't been played enough for Harry.  Well, I felt like.  Couldn't you have just walked in here with your terrycloth shirt and requested it?  Couldn't you have just asked us?  I felt like the bit was done, so I just throw it in there just to toss it.  I also wanted to see if, if anyone could find out, too.  Shut up, stupid.  You didn't want to see if anyone could find out.  I did not.  You did not.  Really?  That's why this kid flew the plane.  I was just testing security.  Just seeing what the hell, the beers and everything didn't matter. 
[02:23:00]  Wow.  Wow.  That real, you know what, that, that kind of.  I'm getting a douche chill.  Reeks of desperation a little bit.  I'm getting a douche chill.  It does reek of desperation a bit.  I don't deny that.  We complimented you on it.  It was very funny.  But, you know, I don't think you can just rest on that.  No, I know.  I don't expect to, but I thought I'd just try it.  I just think you kind of tossed it in there, hoping we would play it and then go,  oh, and by the way, that was done by Harry.  Oh, yeah, there was no denying that. 
[02:23:30]  And then Harry, great job and stuff.  So you're not even denying any of that?  No, no.  I got caught.  That's it.  You got caught.  Yeah.  I'm going to plead guilty.  I like the Zeppelin tribute with Robert Kelly singing lead.  Play that Robert Kelly remix.  Play the Robert Kelly remix.  And even put W slash Zeppelin.  Right.  You know, like a regular Joe.  Yeah.  And Joey Gay shit dick.  Well, Joey Gay is an actual, a real guy I know.  Yes.  Is he really?  He's a comedian.  Yeah.  His name is Joey Gay.  Joey Gay.  But it did theoretically get me in here. 
[02:24:00]  So I can't say that it didn't work, did not work completely.  Well, taking a shit on the desk would have gotten you in here too.  I mean, that doesn't necessarily mean it was a bright move.  And from whack bag.  Well, that's, it's automatic.  That would help.  No, it's just automatic.  If you don't put something in there, it just says from whack.  Like I went through a whack bag.  Yeah.  Like that's why a lot of the posts say.  Is that a default kind of thing that just pops in there?  Martini Steven's studio to help us out here.  Steve.  Steve.  Yeah.  Is this on?  Yeah.  Okay.  It looks like they copied the code and put it on their own website. 
[02:24:30]  That didn't come from opianthony.com.  Oh, it didn't?  No.  No, I went through a whack bag.  That's the only way I knew.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  You do know the interns are not allowed to go on to a whack bag.  Yes.  Yeah.  Hi, Pete.  I'm on the radio.  How are you?  No posting allowed.  I don't post at all.  I was just looking for the instant feedback.  I didn't know how to find it.  Things like posting on the whack bag for interns.  Things like even IMing other people.  No.  Sending private messages to other people through whack bag. 
[02:25:00]  None of that is really accepted.  I'm not a big internet poster.  Dude, did you get this one here?  Play some cuts from Yellow Discipline.  It was from EAB.com.  I wonder what that is.  You can't request your own stuff under an assumed name.  This is very uncomfortable.  Isn't it?  Yeah.  If you would have signed it you, like from Harry.  Our intern requesting his own material from a cubicle out there.  Oh, it's creepy.  Wow.  That is really creepy.  It really is creepy.  That's a good word for it.  Creepy.  Oh.  What are you doing, Travis? 
[02:25:30]  Huh?  Oh, yeah.  Check instant feedback.  Jesus, Travis.  What are you doing?  Oh, you're not here?  Everyone's waving.  Travis is not here.  Everyone's waving off the plane.  Now, we've got to make believe he's not here.  It's a different thing.  Now that we just acknowledge that we're here, now we have to make believe he's not here.  What was 5'11", infant saying?  What were you saying?  Nothing.  I'm not 5'11".  I told you.  6'2".  You're not 6'2".  You're not 6'2".  Don't even start that shit with me. 
[02:26:00]  You're not 6'2".  This has been an ongoing thing with Steve and I.  There was, back in the day before we got Club Soda Kenny and Master Poe, you know, Anthony  and I were doing this popular radio show and we felt like we needed security at times.  And, you know, Martini Steve was doing production and stuff and before his stomach stapling, he  was what, 400 pounds?  400 pounds, yeah.  400 pounds.  And he looked like he was 6'2", 6'3".  Okay?  Yeah.  Well, he gets the stomach staple surgery and he loses 150 pounds, something like that. 
[02:26:30]  He's down under three, way under three.  Yeah, 270.  And he also decided to stop wearing his platform shoes, Anthony, that made him 6'2".  Mm-hmm.  The guy's not even taller than me.  Well, I'm a little bit taller than you.  Back in the day, we felt like we were being protected by this monster.  It turns out you were wearing platform shoes that gave you three inches.  Well, I used to wear them.  Still, no one would screw with them.  Yeah, I wouldn't exactly consider myself meek at the moment.  I mean, do you think you could kick Steve's ass?  No, of course not.  Yeah, exactly.  But it's all about looking intimidating. 
[02:27:00]  And, you know, all of a sudden he drops down three inches and drops 150 pounds.  He's not as intimidating as he used to be.  Maybe there was like a quarter inch of fat on the bottom of my feet.  Fat feet.  But, you know, but for many years, I'm just assuming that Steve was that much taller than  me.  And one day we were walking on the sidewalk, I'm like, what the fuck?  You're as tall as I am.  I just can't believe how offended you are.  I wasn't consciously duping you about my height.  I thought that's how tall I was.  You were duping.  I can get old tapes where we used to ask you how tall you were and you're like, ah, 6'2", 
[02:27:30]  6'3".  I think, no, whatever.  If I'm not, I'm not.  He's a liar, liar.  Everything he wears on fire.  All right, well, here's Harry T's remix.  Are you playing it?  Yeah, we'll play it.  I got another request here.  Oh, yeah?  It says, hey, those Pat O'Brien remixes were so good, especially the Terry Schiavo one and  the two Norton ones, and it's from Not Danny or Not Than.  From Not New York City.  Yeah. 
[02:28:00]  Harry T. Okay, well, this one's going out to Joey Gay.  Right.  Well, Harry.  I requested this.  You accomplished your mission.  You accomplished it by just losing respect and dignity.  But now we're all going to look at you a little differently.  Yeah.  Thinking, oh, God, there goes the creepy guy.  Creepy guy that requests his own material.  His own one bit.  Wait, Norton wants to get, do it in here.  Where's Jimmy?  I broke my knee, man. 
[02:28:30]  Fuck.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my fucking knee, dude.  I broke it, dude.  I fell to crack.  Ah, fuck.  I broke my leg.  I broke it.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Oh, my hand, man.  I've got to squeeze something.  You know, somehow it's just not as funny anymore. 
[02:29:00]  I know.  It stinks now.  Someone's got to dial this number for me.  All right, Tony, go ahead.  Hey, punish that motherfucker.  Make him wait for rent boys.  Do we still have rent boys around?  We certainly do.  All right, get rent boys.  And let's go to Super Golfer from Wack Bag.  Super Golfer.  Hiya, boys.  Hey.  I want to know, is that intern?  See, we're in an eye patch.  An eye patch.  Yeah, we got to.  Wow, you're going way back.  We might have to tell the eye patch story again.  We get creepy interns from time to time. 
[02:29:30]  The eye patch guy.  Well, there was Luca that we nicknamed her Luca because she came in with black eyes and  stuff.  She was always beat up.  And then one day she just never showed up again.  We still have no idea what ever happened to her.  Just disappeared.  Just disappeared.  And then there was the eye patch kid who missed a few days' work and then came in with this  crazy story.  Brian, his name was?  He was in an accident or something?  Yeah, yeah.  He came in late and he was wearing an eye patch.  And we asked him what happened.  He said he got into an accident.  And as we questioned him, his story fell apart, much like the owl-eyed runaway bride story. 
[02:30:00]  It just crumbled under questioning.  He said he was on a motorcycle.  When the motorcycle hit the car?  Yeah, yeah.  The motorcycle hit his car.  And the glass from the passenger window broke and some went in his eye.  And we're talking about how did the window break if the motorcycle hit the door?  And then he said, well, the guy kind of fell off the bike and his head hit the...  Yeah, I don't remember exactly. 
[02:30:30]  But nothing went together.  But he was trying to claim he had glass in his eye and then he had kind of like abrasions  around his eye.  Yeah.  And then we finally got him to take the patch off.  He kept saying, no, my doctor said, no, don't take it off.  Probably one of the most uncomfortable moments in Opie and Anthony history.  He took it off to reveal absolutely nothing was wrong with his eye or anything.  And then he's still trying to lie.  He's still working.  Like, no, right here, look.  Right here, you see.  Right here, there's...  And well, the redness went away, but I still can't quite see.  And he was just lying through his teeth. 
[02:31:00]  Just like the investigators with the runaway bride.  Yeah.  We're like, Brian, there was no accident, right?  No accident.  None, right?  And we actually fired him on the spot because it was, like, way too creepy.  Yeah.  That's different.  What this guy did was like...  Ah, Harry, well, he'll stay here, but we'll look at him now a little different.  The Brian guy was creepy, though, because it was after he, you know, missed a couple days  of work or whatever.  Yeah.  The eye patch.  Harry was just a jizz bag.  It's the worst.  The worst. 
[02:31:30]  We'll be back with more of the worst of Obie and Anthony featuring Nathaniel.  Later, later, later.  It's the worst of Obie and Anthony.  And now, a POTUS 08 presidential election update.  I'm Joe Matthew from POTUS 08, XM Channel 130.  The presidential campaigns will take a break for Christmas, but many voters still will  not be able to hide from the candidates.  As long as the TV is on...  I hope that you and your family will have a magnificent Christmas season.

[02:32:30]  POTUS 08, where everyone is an insider.  It's hockey's hottest ticket.  As the Penguins and Sabres take it outside.  With front line, the shot is scored.  Catch live play-by-play action of the Amp Energy NHL Winter Classic on XM 205.  Beginning New Year's Day at 1245 East.  Baby, it's cold outside.  But the action is going to be hot.  Penguins, Sabres, New Year's Day. 
[02:33:00]  The Amp Energy NHL Winter Classic.  Live on XM 205.  An exclusive presentation of the XM Sports Nation.  Take a seat.  We're taking a trip down memory lane on XM 80s on 8.  My name is Rio.  Video, get the radio star.  BT phoned home, Bueller took a day off, and the Berlin Wall came down.  The totally awesome 80s on 8.  She's a man, a mania. 
[02:33:30]  I said you're going to be starting something.  You got to be starting something.  It's just like being back there again.  You punch into Channel 8.  The 80s on 8 on XM.  Hi, this is Tom Torbjornson with America's Car Show Tip of the Day on XM Radio.  If your car gets hard to steer when it gets wet outside, better listen to what I have to say.  If your car is hard to steer when it gets wet outside, it could be your automatic serpentine belt tensioner is weak or broken.  The SIRP belt tensioner is an idler pulley that has spring tension, holding it hard against the back of the belt. 
[02:34:00]  This keeps proper belt tension regardless of stretch or load from a steering pump or alternator.  When the tensioner spring wears out or breaks, belt tension is lost, resulting in belt squeal, poorly charging systems, and yes, hard steering, especially when it's wet outside.  You see, when water from the road gets on the belt, the power steering pump slips, causing loss of hydraulic assists and thus hard steering.  If you're experiencing this phenomenon when weather occurs, have the belt tensioner checked.  It probably needs replacing.

[02:35:00]  Uh, okay, if a cat falls on your lap while we're doing the interview, are you freaked out?  Yes.  Live at the Verge, an XM exclusive.  Hear it on the Verge.  XM 52.  XM.  LZ.  A to Z.  The complete Zeppelin Studio recordings.  Alphabetically.  All day.  LZ.  Christmas Day.  A to Z.  They realized that we were a group that was, uh, intent on change.  XM.  LZ.  A to Z. 
[02:35:30]  On XM Channel 59.  XM Red.  The Zeppelin Channel.  The Zeppelin Channel.  The Zeppelin Channel.  The Zeppelin Channel.  Opie and Anthony.  So long, been looking too hard, been waiting too long.  Sometimes I don't know what I will find. 
[02:36:00]  I only know it's a matter of time.  When you love someone, when you love someone, it feels so right, so warm and true.  I need to know if you feel it too.  Baby, I'm wrong. 
[02:36:30]  Would you tell me if I'm coming, I'm too strong?  A heart of mine has been hurt before.  This time I want to be sure.  I've been waiting for a girl like you, to come into my life.  I've been waiting for a girl like you, loving will survive. 
[02:37:00]  I've been waiting for a girl like you, to come into my life. 
[02:37:30]  You're so good.  When we make love, it's understood.  It's more than a torch.  We can say, only in dreams, be this way.  When you love someone, yeah.  Really love someone.  Now I know it's right. 
[02:38:00]  From the moment I wake up to deep in the night.  Nowhere on earth I'd rather be.  Holding you.  I've been waiting for a girl like you, to come into my life.  Been waiting for a girl like you, loving will survive. 
[02:38:30]  I've been waiting for someone new, to make me feel alive.  Yeah, waiting for a girl like you, I'm into my life.  Yeah, waiting for a girl like you, I'm into my life. 
[02:39:00]  Okay.  This is Big A.  I'm sorry.  This is Big A.  You're listening to the worst of Opie Nathaniel.  Now stop staring at me and all the rest of them. 
[02:39:30]  Obi and Anthony.  When they played audio, I'm Sam by the way.  The first time they played audio that I edited, I actually saved the bit down on my personal  computer even though my voice wasn't on it.  Or at least, at the very least, you hope for somebody to be like, who brought this in?  Sam?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It was great.  I didn't know I brought it in.  No.  But this particular one is something I cut up.  It's the Trainables. 
[02:40:00]  Mmm.  Oh.  Yes.  I guess there's a common theme with a lot of my picks today.  Yeah, I was thinking of that.  Stuff you've done.  Specially abled individuals doing their own thing.  This is where some people try to teach some of these specially abled individuals about  sex.  Wow.  Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton.  The show.  I guess I'd just say the Opie and Anthony show takes it and makes some funny stuff.  You could say the guys.  They like when you do that.  The boys.  Yeah. 
[02:40:30]  The gang.  The boys.  Alright, this is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Could you not step on my out?  Don't hit me.  Don't get him angry, dude.  It's the worst of the...  Holy shit.  The worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  I think shit is about to go down.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Alright, I got something to play for you.  Bye.  Mom.  Mom.  Yes, honey?  You know when we were talking yesterday?  Yes, we were.  Do you know about periods?  Yes.  What about periods? 
[02:41:00]  Do you have periods?  Yes.  All women have periods.  Tell me what happens.  Blood from inside of my body comes outside from an opening between my legs.  Do you have a question, Jill?  Yes.  I want to know if Susie has periods.  Susie?  Yes, Mom.  Jill wants to know something.  What do you want, Jill?  Susie, do you have periods?  Do I have periods?  Jill, all women have periods about every four weeks for three or four days.  When I'm on my period, blood from inside of my body comes outside from an opening between my legs. 
[02:41:30]  Susie, what about my teacher?  Does Miss Jones have periods?  Yes, Jill.  Your teacher, Mrs. Jones, does have periods.  All women have periods about every four weeks for three or four days.  How dumb is this, kids?  You should be punched in the face and made to give a Hummer in a gymnasium.  Dude, that's stupid questions.  Dude.  Do you get a period?  Ugh.  Ugh. 
[02:42:00]  Don't you get how smart I am?  What?  She's a slow person asking about periods and I sigged into this.  Are you sure?  Oh, I thought she...  Yes.  I thought it was a little kid.  No.  That wasn't like a daughter talking to...  It's a Trainable.  Stop it.  Wow.  They used to be called Trainables.  I thought it was like a seven-year-old or something that's being told about periods.  No, this is Trainables audio.  Oh, my God.  I love this stuff.  I cannot get enough of this.  I love old 50s sex tapes where they talk about sex. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  And I love the Trainable ones where it's teaching retards about, well, mentally challenged people.  Right.  About life, sex, things like that.  Ready to puke?  What is this one about?  Hi, girls.  Hi, Dad.  What have your girls been talking about?  About periods, Daddy.  Dad, can I ask you something?  Sure, honey.  What is it?  Does any girl have periods?  Yes, Jill.  All women have periods about every four weeks. 
[02:43:00]  But, Dad, men don't have periods, do they?  That's right, honey.  Men do not.  Only women.  Blood from inside a woman's body comes outside from an opening between her legs about every  four weeks.  When I punch her in the face.  But the blood, won't it get on her clothes?  No, it won't, because you use a sanitary pad.  A sanitary pad.  Yes, a sanitary pad.  Susie?  What's a sanitary pad?  Come on, Jill.  I'll show you.  I'm having my period now.  Let's go into the bathroom. 
[02:43:30]  She should have asked her black friend what's a sanitary pad.  He would have said, yo, man, that's a clean apartment.  We're going into the silly zone.  Here we go.  Hold on, Jill.  Sure.  Blood comes from your mother's body between her legs when I push her down the stairs.  And you know the whole time the father's answering the 17-year-old, he's just looking at her head,  picturing how nice a hanger would look at the end of it.  Unfortunately, blood didn't come out of your mother when you were born. 
[02:44:00]  Conceived.  What an idiot I am.  That's stupid.  You know, it didn't take.  They went with it, though.  Yeah.  Sometimes they just go with it with you.  Big, stupid, hammer-headed sperm cells swimming toward the egg.  Oh, beat up, beat up.  Oh, I beat the whole crew here.  Just clumsily stepping on all the other sperm.  Oh.  Just caught a wave.  Pushed it up forward. 
[02:44:30]  Pushed it in front of everybody.  Well, I'm in the lead.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Hey, what's in here?  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  The miracle.  Please.  Wonderful.  Want to hear more?  Dopey moe haircut on the sperm.  Oh, big fat tongue hanging out.  Wiggling its way through that egg.  Oh, I made it.  There's some Einstein one just comes in second. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, life.  Fuck it.  That would make a great fucking shirt.  Yeah.  Life.  Life dot dot dot.  Fuck it.  And that dumb sperm shows up and the egg is trying to avoid eye contact.  Oh, here it is.  Like if I just look down.  Oh, here it is.  A little stupid won't latch on.  Lee's too stupid to figure out how to get in here.  And there it is.  And then years later you get, eh, do you get a period, Dad?  No, you dummy. 
[02:45:30]  No, that's when I disappear for four days.  Yeah.  And go hunting with the boys.  Every four weeks.  Big, dopey, flat-headed sperm.  Oh, well, we have more.  Oh, please.  I hope so.  This is a sanitary pad.  This is where I keep them.  Look, it is blue on one side, pride on the other.  That's right.  Right all over.  Sticky stuff, like glue on the blue side. 
[02:46:00]  See?  It's sticky.  Do you know why it's sticky?  No.  Sticky so the pad will stick to my panties.  Oof.  How about sticking it over your mouth, stupid?  This is hot.  Yeah.  Jesus.  So it sticks to my panties.  And you know those panties are nothing sexy.  Big nasty bloomers.  Big retard underwear.  Thank God we didn't live back then, man.  Thank God.  They're equal size in the front and the back.  You know, that whole equal amount of material. 
[02:46:30]  Right.  Where do I stick them?  Well, between the brown and yellow stain.  That's weird.  Sure.  One piece of adhesive goes on the front panel.  Oh, any underwear that has a panel to it.  Lose it.  This sticks on the front panel.  Yeah.  Panel.  Yeah, sometimes they put little frilly things on the waistband to make it look sexy.  It ain't working.  Oh, God.  What a mess back then though.  That's great. 
[02:47:00]  The panties were too big.  The hair down there was making your panties look like you were popping Jiffy Pop popcorn.  Oh.  And then you got this thing.  The sanitary belt.  Then you got something that sticks to the whole mess.  Yeah.  So you don't bleed out.  Fucking bloomers.  Use this belt.  What?  My pad?  No, to hang your retarded self with.  The inside of a panty smells like Indonesia two weeks after the tsunami.  Oh.  Jesus.  How do you use it?  I'm having my period now.  I'll show you how I use it.  Ugh.  You mean the blood's coming from inside your body now?  Yes, from the opening between my legs.  This is a used sanitary pad.  Oh, come on. 
[02:47:30]  Wow.  It looked like jelly.  Whoa.  Man, that's brutal.  Look, there's blood on it.  See?  That's right.  Blood coming from inside my body to an opening between my legs.  Look closer.  Closer.  No, closer.  That old gag.  Yeah, like a pie.  All right, let me have it.  This is a sanitary napkin, Stanley.  Well, let me have it, Ollie.  Mmm.  Mmm.  I'm having it, I'm having it.  I'm having it.  I'm having it.  I'm having it.  I'm having it.  I'm having it.  Oh, man, that's brutal.  Look, there's blood on it.  See?  That's right. 
[02:48:00]  Blood coming from inside my body to an opening between my legs.  Look closer.  Closer.  No, closer.  Bye.  All right, let me have it.  This is a sanitary napkin, Stanley.  Well, let me have it, Ollie.  Mmm.  Indeed, I will let you have it.  Stanley, get a little closer to the sanitary napkin.  What are you going to do with it, Ollie? 
[02:48:30]  I'm going to let you have it.  Mmm.  But I don't think I want it, Ollie.  You said you want it.  Now I'll give it to you.  Oh.  I hope you enjoyed it, old blood face.  Oh, is that awful?  I've got to hear more of that. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, that awful, awful thing she pulled out.  It must have looked like a red slug with skin tags on it.  Oh, God.  This is horrible.  The pan has much blood on it, it's a good time to change it.  Mm-mm.  I'll show you how I change it.  Yeah.  Watch carefully, okay?  See how the pad sticks to my panties?  See?  See? 
[02:49:30]  I fold it over.  Now I wrap it up.  This way it won't make any mess.  Now I put it in the nearest wastebasket.  Like Daddy and Mommy made.  I do not put it in the toilet.  Mess.  I put it in the nearest wastebasket.  Now I take the clean pad.  See?  See, Jill?  Blue.  White.  See?  That's there, so the pad will stick to panties.  See how it sticks to my panties?  Can't you just rip her uterus out?  Yeah. 
[02:50:00]  That's all there is to it.  That's all there is to it.  Bingo.  Yeah.  Wow.  That is brutal.  There's a film with this?  How much does she show?  Actually, this came from Nathaniel, right?  Does she show any sninging?  Ah, Nathaniel.  What a find, my friend.  Good job.  Wow.  We love these.  This beats the crap out of the Danny fetus story.  He's flipping me the first.  Is this online or is this actually a home video?  Uh, his sister, Jill.  Oh, God. 
[02:50:30]  That's horrible.  Is it a video?  Uh, yes.  One that I definitely found on my own and was not sent in by a listener.  Oh, okay.  Because I'm better than Danny.  Thank you.  Of course you are.  I would love to see.  Do they show any?  Yeah.  Is the older sister showing the snatch?  No.  Oh, damn it.  She's wearing one of those old long skirt kind of things.  Oh, so she takes her panties off under the skirt and kind of.  Yeah.  But I'll let Opie play the next clip, but they do show what they're talking about in the next clip.  Oh, they do? 
[02:51:00]  Not, nothing.  No.  When she takes her panties off under the skirt, does it look like the elevator in The Shining?  Wow.  That old blood fountain gash.  Great trainable, isn't she?  And she's a slow one, huh?  You ripped your wife's panties off and then you left her crumpled in the hallway.  I don't recollect that at all.  I think I should change my sanitary pad.  Oh, and when do you think you should change your sanitary pad? 
[02:51:30]  As soon as possible.  Well, the next try, the trainable puts a pad on.  Puts a pad on.  Yes.  I ain't looking forward to it.  Now you try it.  Let's pretend you're having your period.  Let's make believe that blood is coming out from inside your body through an opening between your legs now.  Okay, I'll get a pad.  Look, it's blue on one side and white on the other. 
[02:52:00]  That's right.  It's sticky.  It is sticky.  It's sticky, all right.  Like Daddy's tummy.  It's sticky because it'll stick to your panties.  Are you ready to put it on now?  Yes.  First I put my panties down.  Oh.  I'll get the pad.  Now what we do is peel off the paper.  Right, peel off the paper.  Where are you putting it? 
[02:52:30]  The waste basket.  The waste basket.  Okay.  Now what are you going to do?  I'm sticking it in my panties.  All right, it's down to your panties.  We placed it on there so it's sticky.  Meanwhile, this dummy is bumbling around the bathroom dripping blood like an Alzar Cowey beheading video.  Stumbling around with her awful bloomers pulled on her ankles.  Where's the pad?  Where's the pad?  How old is Jill, Nathaniel? 
[02:53:00]  Am I on?  I'd estimate about 12.  12?  13.  13 just learning about this?  Yeah, dropping trow in this video.  And is she profoundly retarded?  Because she sounds like you could kind of teach her a thing.  Yeah.  She's about, you know.  It's Down syndrome or is she just a?  She's got a pretty big head.  All right.  I was just wondering what type of mental disability she had.  Is she an actress, though, playing the part? 
[02:53:30]  What?  Hey, you know.  Julia Lewis was able to pull it off.  You never know.  No, I think she's just a highly trained trainable.  Yeah.  All right.  Wow.  Okay.  Got to go to the phone real fast.  Taylor in VA, Virginia.  Taylor?  Yeah.  What's up, buddy?  Dude, you guys just made me spray coffee all over my windshield with the fucking, you know,  I'm on my period now.  Let me show you.  Fucking disgusting.  This is the worst.  Jimmy's sitting there massaging a rod.  No, dude.  I'm packing like a half right now.  Eric wants to know if this is the sexiest state audition. 
[02:54:00]  Eric from Philly.  Very good.  Back to the tape.  Do your panties.  You place it on there so it sticks on, okay?  Okay.  Yes, real good.  I pull my panties up.  Good job, little smucker's leg.  Where's my hands?  I drive my hands.  Now I'm all ready.  All ready.  Yeah, I'm all ready.  Jump in front of a bus. 
[02:54:30]  I'm really proud of you.  You wear it for a while for practice and for time.  Practice!  Let's go tell Mom and Dad what I did.  She's got to wear it for practice.  What else?  Sick family.  Yeah, this is a little twisted, man.  You know, one time, dumbbells, you know, put it on adhesive side up.  Oh.  It's sticky.  She's going to seal herself up and just save the world a lot of trouble.  You know what you do?  You just wait until they have it in the shower at school and throw tampons at them. 
[02:55:00]  You'll plug it up, plug it up.  This was before tampons, though.  Yeah.  They had to use a lot bigger stuff.  Oh, my God, having to teach this girl about a tampon.  Well, she's crying in the bathroom.  You just point at it and go, bad girl.  Oh, dirty.  Dirty girl.  Filthy.  That means you're a whore and Jesus hates you.  That's the devil coming out.  What, do you give her a crucifix and put on the exorcist?  You know what to do, stupid. 
[02:55:30]  What else do we have, Opie?  I've got to hear more.  Jill, I have a question for you.  What do you do with the one you take off that has a lot of blood on it?  Fold it over, wrap it up, and put it in the nearest wastebasket.  That's right.  You fold it, wrap it up, and put it in the nearest wastebasket.  Now I know all women have periods.  Put it in the wastebasket.  That's it.  This guy's in hell. 
[02:56:00]  Fold it up and throw it away.  Now the whole bathroom smells like a jar of pennies.  Well, Anthony, I've got more.  Sorry, I stepped back.  Thanks to Nathaniel.  We've got trainables saying penis and cock.  Oh!  But first, it's a little bit about sex ed.  Sex ed.  Nice.  You've got to train these people.  Yes, Nathaniel?  Sorry, this whole video, it's like the ABCs of sex for trainables or whatever.  It starts with two minutes of just this trainable walking along a street  and a car pulling up, coaxing her into it and driving off. 
[02:56:30]  Was it a Saturn?  So I guess this is to try to prevent that sort of thing from happening.  Oh, God, is that correct?  And it wasn't a trainable.  It was just Voss walking after his car broke down.  And what year would you say these are made?  These are definitely 60s.  Oh, 60s?  Early or late?  It has to be early.  Early 60s are really close to 50s.  Yeah, it has that 50s sound to it.  Yeah, this one might be a little later than the one from before because if you hear the soundtrack, 
[02:57:00]  it's just sort of this hippie...  A little groovy?  Like, I believe it was by the Lake Springs.  Great, and then your pad will look like a tie-dyed shirt.  You tool.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Featuring Nathaniel.  It's the worst.  He's reached his potential.  This is as far as he can go.  This is it.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, this one's short but sweet.  You can't go wrong with something called Doug Stanhope fisting story.  Let's hear it.  On the worst of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:57:30]  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right, we got Lisa in Florida.  She wants to talk to Doug.  Lisa, turn down your radio.  Lisa.  Sorry.  Yeah, turn down the radio.  Yeah, sorry.  All right, you're on with Doug Stanhope.  You're not going to sing, are you?  No, Doug, actually, it's a very funny story.  Last night, I was just telling my girlfriend about my sexcapade with you about 10 years ago  when you came down to Florida.  10 years ago?  Running for Pauly Shore.  Oh.  Wait, what happened? 
[02:58:00]  Pauly Shore?  What?  He was fighting for Pauly Shore.  He was in his mommy's place.  I had to open for Pauly Shore.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Wow, that was a while ago.  I was walking in, and we had a really crazy night, and I don't think he remembers it,  but, you know.  Were you like an old bro?  Oh, wait, I can't see you.  Can you call back in an hour?  Why, why?  You can keep it clean.  I can.  Did Doug struggle?  I'm sorry. 
[02:58:30]  There's two.  Wow.  Wait, Anthony.  There's one you could have been.  Hold on.  Watch how Anthony explains the motion you just made.  Hold on.  Okay.  Well, Doug is maybe suggesting that during this episode that you had with Doug, that perhaps  he did a certain act.  Yes, he did.  That was like boxing?  That would best be done by a boxer.  Right.  Or think, what were the Olympics?  1968?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Was it the 1968?  The black power sign. 
[02:59:00]  Is he saying yes?  You did?  Wow.  Yes.  The black power sign.  What?  That was the first time, too.  Yeah, that was my first time I'd ever actually achieved the entire...  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  You got it.  You got it.  Wow.  You got it.  Wow.  So, let me...  I'm just going to ask something here.  Okay.  Let me ask something here.  I don't understand how it gets to that point.  I just want to know...  How did the conversation go?  Caligula?  Is it more a ring, a bracelet, or tennis elbow? 
[02:59:30]  It was a watch.  It was a watch.  A watch?  A watch, yeah.  Wow.  All right.  Yeah, like I said, I still talk about it to this day.  Wait, wait, wait.  I bet you do.  Why do you still talk about it to this day?  I'm telling you just yesterday.  And I can't believe that you're on today, so I had to call.  How does that come up?  I have a picture of you in a bar that we were at.  It was called The Bar down there.  All right. 
[03:00:00]  And you're holding a personal part of you in the picture in the back of the bar.  I still have that picture.  Goddamn dog, man.  Well, you just saw Pauly Shore, so I figured...  You probably figured, how could this be any worse?  It wasn't actually what you think it was.  Doug was just practicing.  He actually, at that point, thought he was going to be a ventriloquist.  Yeah, yeah.  So he was trying out his act.  Doug had to make Lisa suffer because he was opening up for Pauly Shore.  He was not happy.  He had to make someone suffer.  What time is it?  All right, sir. 
[03:00:30]  Wanted her to feel what the whole audience felt like listening to Pauly.  Wow, Lisa, that's a hell of a story you got.  How did that come up?  Seriously.  Yeah, how does the conversation get to a point where this is happening?  I don't know.  A lot of alcohol?  Yeah, I would think a lot.  Last night, you said, I was just talking about it yesterday.  How does that...  With my friend?  I don't know.  It was just one of those things that kind of...  I don't even know how we got there. 
[03:01:00]  And I just blurted it out.  It was like, oh, I don't know why I told her this story yesterday, but I even told...  They were watching Raging Bull.  Probably not going to have to listen to the radio on because I kind of forgot to turn it  off before I left.  So I'm probably going to be in a lot of shit when I get home, but I really don't care.  Sorry.  Give me the cuss.  That's all right.  It happens.  For everything that slipped through there.  She's walking around the hotel room bloody at the end.  You never got me down, Doug. 
[03:01:30]  Never got me.  I'm still standing, Doug.  It wouldn't have been bloody.  There was not even a lot of give.  There's not a lot of fight, I should say.  Not a lot of fight.  And that guy sat on the couch while Doug and I were in a room for like five hours.  And waited for me to come out and take me home.  But there was something about this that you had to tell your friend.  That's what we're getting...  Because you could have just said, look, I spent a night with Doug Stanhope. 
[03:02:00]  I had sex with Doug Stanhope.  But there was something about that that you needed someone to know.  Now, I don't know.  Well, I don't know.  Well, just because...  I'm going to...  You know, like, I've seen him around.  He's still going on.  And that's really awesome.  He's still a name.  Now, did you have a lot of...  Actually, back then, he wasn't really not yet.  You know, like...  Why would you?  Just some road pick.  Lisa, so...  Did you have a bunch of kids before you were with Doug Stanhope for the night? 
[03:02:30]  Yes, I had five.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  Mommy.  Jeez.  Yeah.  And I'm a hot mama, yeah.  Yeah.  My kids are all, like, grown out, yeah.  Doug was trying to be a magician with a hat pulling a rabbit out.  I don't believe you remember that.  Yeah.  And he wrote a CD to my kids.  Sorry for holding your mom up.  Oh, really?  Holding your mom up.  Yeah.  Hey, um...  I still have that, too.  How old of a lady are you, Lisa?  I just turned 44 a week and a half ago. 
[03:03:00]  So at 34, you had five kids.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, I got married when I was 20.  Now I'm a widow, so...  That might have been the impetus to try that when she told me that.  Well...  Wait, wait.  This story has a sad ending.  You're a widow.  What happened?  Yeah, well, actually, I was already separated.  He was in bad health, so he had an aneurysm, so...  And, you know, life happened, whatever.  What finally happened?  Yeah, what happened? 
[03:03:30]  Huh?  What finally happened?  He had an aneurysm, and it killed him.  Oh.  Yeah, I was on my way to go get a divorce the morning and eat glass.  I was on my way to the lawyer.  Oh, you were?  All right.  Yeah, so, whatever.  Yeah, whatever.  Just the father of your kids, whatever.  Yeah, I know.  Just the father of my kids.  Now, you know, I still...  You always have that hole to remind you. 
[03:04:00]  Hey, were you separated when Doug did what he did?  No, I was not separated.  I was really married.  Wow.  Wow.  Maybe that killed him.  Yeah.  Maybe it was that.  Is that one of the times this story came up?  Yeah.  You're calling another morning radio program, News Talk 1310 that he listens to?  Yeah, that's what killed him.  That'll give a guy an aneurysm, man.  That's what killed him. 
[03:04:30]  He couldn't follow that.  Finding out, dude.  Goddamn.  Pauly Shore's opener.  Pauly Shore's opener.  Yeah.  What the hell is this little thing going to do?  When I walked in, I saw him when I was walking in, and it turned out he ended up on stage,  and I don't even know.  It was just crazy.  When I set my mind to something, I usually do it, so.  Yeah.  Sound like a real go-getter.  Yeah.  And when someone...  It turned out I was Doug that night.  And when someone offers me anything at all, I'll usually take it.  So it's weird.  Weird how your determination and my lack of any standards came together. 
[03:05:00]  I knew that for him, though.  I knew you had no standards, but I heard your comments.  Worlds collide, angel.  I didn't think about anything.  Hey, has that happened to you since, or was that one and done?  That's pretty much...  Well, as far as that kind of situation, yeah.  I mean, I did other, but as far as like...  Oh, now it's a venue for...  All right, hold on.  All right, hold on.  All right, Wences.  Yeah.  Now we're getting into some... 
[03:05:30]  You know how they say, like, pot leads to a heart of drugs?  Yeah, yeah.  So, Doug doing that to you, what did that lead to?  I'm sorry.  You've got to be doing some horrific things at this point.  Nickname's Ol' Oven Mitt.  I was looking for guys with first baseman gloves.  Don't get me wrong, but I didn't have any like I did with Doug.  Yeah.  All right.  None.  What some do with ping pong balls she does with grapefruits down there in the sunshine state.  I like the real thing. 
[03:06:00]  I don't need toys.  Huh?  I said, I like the real...  You like the real thing?  Yeah.  I'm not into the toys.  I like the real thing.  The real thing?  All right.  Yeah.  Toys, what, Tonka?  I'm sorry for the disappointment, but hey, you know.  Oh, you didn't disappoint at all.  Believe me.  Anyway...  That sounds like a memorable moment.  Yeah.  You took my knuckle virginity.  I'm just happy that you remembered.  I've got people calling me, and man, I bet so many people are going to listen to me on 
[03:06:30]  the radio.  I'm going to be in so much trouble this morning.  I just have to make sure...  Thank God I'm the only one who listens to the buzz.  I'm the only one who listens to the rock and roll.  My kids don't.  Yeah.  They listen to their MP3s and their CD players.  See?  Well, you're making West Palm Beach very proud today.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sure.  I am going to hear so much.  I know a lot of people.  How ironic.  She's from West Palm.  I'm a little slow today.  Oh, God. 
[03:07:00]  Going to move up here to the Finger Lakes region.  I'm going to whore at that same condo.  Anyway, hey, Doug.  Oh, Lisa, shut up.  I'm glad that you're, like, still going on, and you're really funny.  Can't keep our mouth shut, either.  It was a good time, Angel.  I'm glad we didn't ruin it by keeping in touch.  Angel.  Hey.  Hey.  Have a great day, guys.  Have fun and keep making young comics happy out there. 
[03:07:30]  Hey, I'll do my best.  Thank you, Lisa, from Florida.  Yeah, it's a great little story today.  Man, what a good story.  It's great, Doug.  I got a whore at that same condo that ended up stealing my identity and opening up a...  God damn, Doug's got the best story.  What was the name of that?  The West Palm Beach, the old club.  I never knew the old club.  Anyway, Comedy Corner or something.  But, yeah, and I...  So, when I first got... 
[03:08:00]  Like, I started getting collection agents calling me, sending me letters saying I owe for a Southern Bell Telephone.  Like, I never lived in the Southeast.  So, I called them up, and I got the information, and I started thinking.  They had my social security number.  They had all my information.  It must be someone from one of the clubs down there that, like, got, like, maybe filled out some paperwork after the show to get paid, and they had my social security.  Yeah.  And then I remember that one whore I got, and I was pretty hammered, and she came over, and she took my credit card information, and she's calling it back to the service. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, prostitute whore.  Okay.  Yeah, prostitute.  And she goes, yeah, they need your social security to verify it, and I just sling it out, and I just...  Yeah, as soon as I got done saying it, I'm like, why did I just give her my social security number?  Oh, wow.  So, the next day, I canceled the credit card, because I knew...  But she still had it, ended up opening up a phone line and some other stuff. 
[03:09:00]  That was one of the...  I'll save this for the...  The other side?  I got ripped off with a credit card, too.  The same thing with whores in New York, and they charged, like, $10,000 on my credit card.  $6,000 one time, and, like, $4,000 the other time, and that's how I caught it.  How were they buying?  I don't know.  Dignity?  A little more credit than that.  Let's go to Billy in Queens.  Billy?  Yeah, how you doing?  I got a question for Doug. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  Did you ever get your watch back?  I left it behind.  It's an Indiglo.  Very good, very good, brother.  Take care.  Have a good one.  You squeeze it, you light up her genital warts.  It's like spelunking.  Oh, God.  Goddamn, just when, you know, a girl calls up with it, like, oh, I had sex with this  guy's story.  And you know with Doug, it's not just going to be, it was a beautiful evening, we laid 
[03:10:00]  down, it was missionary, and it was wonderful, and I left, and he kissed me goodbye, and it's  just like, yeah, I don't know.  She was, afterwards he's wiping his hand in a towel like he just birthed a mare.  Oh, God.  It's the worst.  The worst.  We'll be back with more of the worst of Opie and Anthony, featuring Nathaniel.  Like it. 
[03:10:30]  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the worst.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Featuring Nathaniel.  It's the worst.  He's reached his potential.  This is as far as he can go.  This is it.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, it's Sam from the Opie and Anthony Show, and also occasionally the Than and Sam  Show.  I'm joined by Sam, also of the Than and Sam Show.  What's up?  What's up, man?  How you doing? 
[03:11:00]  Pretty well.  How are you?  Pretty good.  Remember when we did our first radio show?  Unfortunately, I do.  I thought it was a smash hit.  I believe it was December of 06.  Yeah, I think you're right.  And we were lucky enough to get a nice bit of on-air, live feedback on the Opie and Anthony  Show about our show from the previous weekend.  That wasn't nice.  And we even got one of the very important people in this company, Eric Logan, a.k.a.  Elo, to give us his personal feedback. 
[03:11:30]  Normally, you don't get that kind of direct conversation.  There's a lot of degrees of separation.  So, he called in the Opie and Anthony Show and gave us his review.  I'm pretty sure it was glowing.  No, it wasn't.  Well, we'll find out, won't we?  No, it wasn't.  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's probably good.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Elo.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Elo.  How are you?  How you doing, guy?  Doing okay.  Hi, Eric.  Hi, Jimmy. 
[03:12:00]  How are you?  Good.  What did you think of the Than and Sam Show?  Do you want them sitting in for this review?  Oh, wait.  No.  Holy Jesus.  Dude, I didn't touch a thing.  Wait, hold on now.  Sam and Than are now in the studio.  Fucking Elo has his own sound effect.  Elo's got a sound effect.  You creep.  You're down there in Washington with your own sound effects?  Oh, my God.  What is wrong with you? 
[03:12:30]  Holy shit.  Nothing.  You lose.  So.  Do you play these during meetings?  Yeah.  Actually, what I have a whole thing is if somebody walks in my office and they go, hey, Eric.  So it's wired to my side.  That's very important.  God damn Elo, man.  He's like Alan Sniffen.  He's doing his own radio show there in the office.  It's Eric Logan. 
[03:13:00]  Give us another.  The jingles are being cut as we speak.  Give us another example of how you use your sound effects there.  Boring.  There's a lot of that that happens.  Is that on your side or is that for people in the office who are listening to whatever  spiel they're getting?  No, I've got to run through the system.  People will sit in my office and they'll ask a question.  A lot of times, right now, we're doing all of our budgets.  So I hear a lot of this.  If people try to explain what the hell's going on with the numbers. 
[03:13:30]  By the way, in case you're curious, I thought I had blown it when I was up there.  Remember, Anthony, when I reached over and car crashed myself?  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  That's why I knew where car crash was on the instant replay.  Oh.  Do you have a replay machine in your office?  Yeah.  I've got an actual replay machine in my office, completely loaded with 10 banks of 50 each.  I can't get one.  He knows it's right here on the corner.  Yeah, right here. 
[03:14:00]  There we go.  Oh, my God.  Boring.  He's got his own machine.  That's really funny.  All right.  Well, we've got Than and Sam sitting in.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Awesome.  Thanks, Eric.  Yeah.  Just curious, your thoughts of the show.  Dan, you thought it was a good thing to do, him asking you what you guys thought.  Yep. 
[03:14:30]  I will admit we got off to a rough start.  Right.  I think we were a little distracted at the start.  Uh-huh.  A little too, I don't know, apprehensive about people calling in and messing with us.  Uh-huh.  And then I felt like we got a little better, I think.  At what point did you feel the show actually kind of got into its own?  Uh, Tony.  Suggestions from Tony was a nice segment where we started building up steam.  Now, on this...  Explain that, because I didn't get to...  Well, I...  Because I was at a Christmas party. 
[03:15:00]  Let me make sure I get it right.  I mean, what's interesting is that they had a guy, Tony, come in.  By the way, he did a horrible job of setting up who he was.  I had no idea who he was.  Just like this guy named Tony appeared out of nowhere, right?  Okay.  So you need to, like, make sure the audience understands that.  So Tony comes in with suggestions of things that would happen, like, next week.  First of all, I think that's a little cocky to think that you're actually going to have a next week.  Whoa.  So I think you need to kind of say, hey, listen, we hope this is something that can develop.  I mean, candor is an important thing with your audience.  Okay.  I guess insecurity is another thing we want to project as well, right? 
[03:15:30]  Right.  Well, you know, having shown...  Be as timid as possible.  Right.  Okay.  I'd start there.  All right.  I thought that was one of the problems.  All right.  All right.  You got that part.  All right.  All right.  Now, I'm just...  There was a part about the suggestions for Tony where it was the drink, eff, and fight.  Yes.  Remember that part?  Yes.  Okay.  Now, you were encouraging people to call in with what they're doing as they're listening to the show.  Mm-hmm.  Now, do you realize that on multiple occasions you were encouraging people to drink more and drive at the same time? 
[03:16:00]  And they would call in and go, yeah, we're driving, we're drinking.  And the response from you and Fan were like, oh, Sam was great.  Now, you do realize...  So you thought that was the good part?  It's a liability.  Is it really?  Yes.  Encouraging people to commit felonies while on the air over a national media on a federally licensed license that goes out is against the law.  Sam?  Sam might debate on that.  Hello, here's Sam.  No, I'm not debating.  He's jamming the middle finger over the microphone. 
[03:16:30]  There's no middle finger.  Ah, look how nervous he is.  There's no middle finger.  Don't joke here.  That was his thumb, sorry.  No, I don't remember specifically doing that, but I think...  Yes, I don't remember.  Well, let me help you.  Let me help remind you.  Dennis from Full Blown Age when he called in.  Uh-huh.  I mean, a specific note of this.  How great it was.  He was driving around drinking, and I think your reply was, oh, that's great.  Keep it going, buddy.  And it wasn't sarcastic, Hilo? 
[03:17:00]  Uh, no.  It was very encouraging.  I'll have to listen back to that.  Yeah, maybe we can pull that and...  Yeah, pull that clip.  I think that'd be a good one for you to pull.  All right.  And then do it again.  Now, Sam, I want to talk about your...  By the way, I thought that you had a nice little potpourri of places you went.  You had the whole MySpace thing about how you kind of surf MySpace, which was kind of pointless, but that was okay.  And then the suggestions from Tony was fine. 
[03:17:30]  But the weekly Hollywood buzz, let's talk about this for a second.  I heard this now.  Now, this is a segment that I heard, and I had commented quickly when we were in commercial break that I thought it was a little odd to have used a game show theme song as a Hollywood kind of wrap-up thing.  I thought it was weird that the Price is Right music.  It's one of my bits.  Oh, so...  So one of your bits is to have the wrong audio for the right bit?  Yeah.  I mean, if you're going to do the...  I mean, by the way, there's not a morning show anywhere in America that doesn't use the hacky Hollywood gossip. 
[03:18:00]  What theme music do you think they use every single time?  Jimmy just pushed his mic away and went, ugh.  Oh, that was a rough one.  That was a rough one.  As soon as I heard every morning show in America, I'm like, this is not going to be complimentary.  The point of Hollywood news and gossip isn't actually to report what's going on in Hollywood.  It's a bit...  It's also sarcastic.  It's like a parody of the... 
[03:18:30]  I'm reporting the news.  The whole key.  And Stan is obviously completely disinterested in the news that I'm reporting, but I continue on anyway.  So when you guys talked about the Torrey Spelling yard sale, and there were hundreds of people that were there, give me the parody about that, because you were reporting the news like you were reading it from a magazine.  That would be me actually reading it from a magazine, and Stan not interested in it, as if to say this is not interesting, but there's Sam pushing on anyway.  This is hard to sit through.  I know it is.  Okay, you just actually explained this to me, Sam. 
[03:19:00]  I am more lost than I was before I heard the bit.  Well, it's Stan.  Stan, what do you do in this bit?  He's trying to tell you out, Stan.  He's saying the bit.  He's basically saying, I did my part.  Yeah, I did my part.  Stan's part is to be disinterested.  And obviously he was screwing it up, because I did my part fine.  Obviously the reason that Elo didn't enjoy this is because of Stan's participation in this bit. 
[03:19:30]  Wow.  That's not what I'm saying.  You guys don't know how to handle the divide and conquer thing yet.  Yeah, man.  And listen, I've been working with morning shows my entire career, even shows as challenging as the Opie and Anthony show.  I have never in my career ever heard either one of them sell each other out in the degree, this is happening in the first ten minutes.  I think there's some hyperbole going on here.  Hyperbole?  Yes.  Can you define hyperbole?  Exaggeration.  Can you actually spell it?  Yes.  Is that your idea for Good Radio Eric, spelling? 
[03:20:00]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Did you just taser me?  Yeah, he did.  He's tasered you from his office in Washington.  Oh, Stan ain't taking no shit!  I can tell you what, you could actually spell check that entire show and it would be entertaining.  That was horrible.  Oh, he crushed himself.  All right.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, so good. 
[03:20:30]  So let's forget what I think.  Forget what I think.  I mean, what was the highlight for, say, you and Sam?  I mean, obviously you guys are clearly not on the same page because you're trying to sell each other out.  So what was your highlight, Stan?  I mean, what was the thing when you walked out of there, you go, man, we nailed that Torrey spelling.  I mean, what bit was it that you guys really felt like you nailed?  No, like I said, I think the Tony suggestions, it was good because his suggestions were awful and made for good fodder for me and Sam to pick on them.  Right.  Sam? 
[03:21:00]  I agree.  I think that was the one bit that we did best on.  That had nothing to do with either one of you.  It had to deal with Tony coming in and callers.  Well, the bit was not, Tony didn't make up the bit.  We made up the bit because we saw how funny Tony was.  We brought him in and then we made him funny.  All right.  So let's say hypothetically we're to do another Stan and Sam show.  Yes.  And you guys are in my office pitching me on Episode 2.  Uh-huh.  What should I take away from the call now and also what happened on Saturday as to why I should say yes to this? 
[03:21:30]  I would say the major development areas, if I could use business speak, stemmed from just at being our first show, our first show being live and that there are things that would improve if we were to give it another chance.  Like I'd say we had something funny to say about most things and the problem was just some of the roughness with having done our first show live. 
[03:22:00]  Can I ask a question?  I didn't hear any of the show.  I was away.  How long was the show?  Three hours.  Oh, it was three?  Okay.  Why did you feel it started off rough?  It did start off rough.  I mean, why?  Was the jokes bad?  No, we were slow.  We weren't on the same page.  We had to go from topic to topic.  Stan was distracted.  I wasn't there for him as much as I should be.  There's a very concrete example of me taking a stand on something, Sam completely contradicting me and me going, yeah.  Oh, shit.  But, you know, that's not something that's going to happen every time.  Well, you go, yeah, why?  Because I was agreeing with him, disagreeing with me completely. 
[03:22:30]  Because I was looking at the phone to topic.  But in terms of the show having room to grow, there's obviously a lot of interest in it.  Regardless of what the comments were, the reviews on the message boards were definitely mixed.  But the fact that they were mixed works in our favor because they were chomping at the bit to destroy us.  Furthermore, for a show to be on from 12 a.m. to 3 a.m. and have a 19-page listening thread. 
[03:23:00]  Shows there's interest.  And the phone banks were lit.  It was seven people replying to every post.  And the phone banks were lit the entire night.  Ooh.  Sam wasn't going to take that fucking, Sam would jump right in there and finish his thought.  Absolutely.  Put that little put down.  If I could add in something, Elo, I think after this discussion and your critique of the program,  I think you'd be silly not to let them do it again because more people would listen. 
[03:23:30]  You just made them stars.  I think we should rename the show.  Oh.  This isn't going to be good.  I think we should rename the show Trainwreck Radio.  Oh.  Oof.  If we'll get us on the air again.  Oh.  We'll take it.  Yeah.  Okay.  So now if we rename the show Trainwreck Radio with Sam and Sam, you guys will do it?  Yeah.  I mean.  Yeah.  But you're opening yourselves up to libel there.  Once we start rocking the house, people are going to be very upset when they turn it to Trainwreck Radio, and it rules. 
[03:24:00]  And it's not a trainwreck.  It's okay.  Listen, I already have it federally copyrighted and trademarked.  You can't take it anywhere.  I'll own the name, so don't worry about it.  Website.  Hopefully you can keep it.  Yeah.  So now you guys willing to do another show?  Yes.  Ready and willing.  You guys desperately want to do another show?  Very much so.  And I sensed a little of the terse sarcasm about the time that you had the show on.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, gee, easy, Steve.  Wow, that was double, Steve.  I think the time slot makes sense, considering our experience.  We were just saying that the fact that there were that many callers at that hour is more impressive than if there were that many callers at an earlier hour.  Well, I'm willing to move the start time up a few hours to give you guys a little bit more of an East Coast clear, as we'd say here in the biz.  We'll take it.  Hmm.  6 a.m.?  6 a.m.?  Are you sure the method can handle it?  I'll sleep.  Uh, and by the way, the only reason I can't, because I can't stay up until 2 a.m. to hear this crap again. 
[03:25:00]  I'd just rather see it.  Oh, my God.  We could just send you an mp3, too.  No, I want to hear it live as it happened, because I was just as drunk as the rest of your audience when I was listening.  I think we have to cut it down to two hours, though.  Uh-huh.  Two hours.  By the way.  The first hour, bitching about the microphones.  What amazes me is two guys who produce this show every single day can't figure out how the studio works.  There was bitching about the microphones?  The room had to be turned, and all these problems, and guys coming in. 
[03:25:30]  It's like, if you guys didn't have any problems.  I just couldn't get the camera on.  The one, yeah, I'd say one technical difficulty was the pal-talk camera.  The pal-talk camera.  How hard is it turning a camera on?  It obviously wasn't working.  Apparently, very hard.  You click send video, and then the video doesn't send, so it's not hard, but it didn't work.  All right, so the train wreck radio hour.  Two.  Yes, two-hour show, right? 
[03:26:00]  Cutting an hour out already, huh?  What's this?  Let's see some clips.  I want to hear you disagree.  I want to hear Thang going, yeah, I'm paying attention to something else.  I'm going to pull that.  All right, backing up there, Elo, when these guys were encouraging people to drink and drive,  you were saying?  Yeah.  We got the clip.  Dennis from FBA, what are you doing?  Tony.  I'm Darren, dude.  Gunslinger from FBA.  I just got done four-wheel driving out in the desert out here in North of Vegas chasing  jackrabbits around in my pickup truck.  Atta boy, Dennis.  Atta boy.  That's Tony. 
[03:26:30]  Are you going to fight the jackrabbits?  No, I was trying to spotlight them with my shotgun.  Are you going to fuck them?  But it's kind of hard to do.  Hell no.  Well, then, apparently Tony thinks there's something wrong with you.  Dennis, get a hold of yourself, pal.  That was Tony, who was also in the studio drunk.  The whole reason he was in the studio is because he didn't know what he was doing, and he's  the one who...  He didn't even encourage it.  He just asked if he was drunk.  He said...  But that's encouraging, because if he responds and says, yes, you're encouraging, you're sending  signals about a guy driving four-wheel or chasing jackrabbits, and then asking if you're 
[03:27:00]  drunk.  Well, if he replied, yes, I am drinking, we would have said, cut that out, sir.  It's irresponsible.  You're connecting the dots.  That's where you get in trouble.  That is where you have the encouragement part.  When the whole bit is called Drink, F, and Fight.  No, that was Tony's bit that we said was a bad idea.  Okay.  That's why he was there.  But let me ask you a question.  Did you broadcast it to a national audience, to the entire country of North America?  Yes, that it was a bad idea.  We did broadcast it.  That bit was a bad idea.  And then you asked the guy a question, hey, are you drinking, as he's driving through a 
[03:27:30]  field chasing jackrabbits?  Yes, in terms of...  Okay.  I mean, you said yes three times.  The setup was that we were asking people if they're drinking.  Nice crap.  Fucking are fighting.  There's just something funny about that, knowing he's looking around for the right button to  put on.  And he's half listening to you, like, looking for buttons.  Yeah.  Doesn't even care.  Sounds like me.  Elo, how about Trainwreck Radio today at 11? 
[03:28:00]  I think we should just give it a shot here in 40 minutes, Opie.  What a great idea.  Dan's saying no.  Sam?  I mean, if this is our only shot, then yeah.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Guys, come on now.  You were doing Midnight on the East.  You're going to get 11 a.m. on a primetime Monday.  You get nothing!  I mean, listen, here's the thing.  I was pleasantly surprised on one, on a couple of fronts. 
[03:28:30]  Ooh.  Sounds like we're getting set up.  No.  No, true.  I mean, I heard the Black Earl Show, which was horrid.  I mean, this was not that bad.  Not as bad as Earl's show.  Wait, Earl's show is not good?  Oh.  Earl?  Oh, God.  He's still pitching it, though, isn't he?  Yeah, he won't stop.  The Black Rock Coalition, yeah.  Can we hear some of it?  We've heard it over the years.  It's him doing all the black artists and talking about them and stuff.  Oh, I thought he did one on XM.  He did. 
[03:29:00]  This goes back a while.  Well, we've critiqued the hell out of that.  It stunk?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was horrible.  I think you were filming Lucky Louis.  Oh, okay.  And what's the other one?  No, just the fact they actually got it done.  They got it done.  That would surprise me.  All right.  My expectations were so low.  All right.  Your final summary here.  I give them a passing grade and willing to give them another shot.  Thank you very much, Eric.  There you go.  But you've got to understand, we've got to be tough on this.  I mean, this is the biggest channel on the platform. 
[03:29:30]  We can't allow you guys to slack and phone it in.  Absolutely not.  That's just for the morning show.  I expect the prep.  I expect you guys to have it nailed.  So, the train wreck radio hour.  You know what you guys do?  Here's what you do.  What's that?  This is what me and Elphi have done our entire career.  Yes, this motherfucker to death.  And then do whatever the fuck you're going to do anyway.  And you'll be huge stars.  That's how it works.  We read you loud and clear, Eric.  There you go.  Good job.  And any other advice for the youngsters? 
[03:30:00]  No.  Please call in for our show.  Oh.  All right.  Thanks, Hilo.  All right, guys.  Bye, Eric.  There you go, Zarek.  Well, all right.  Not all bad.  Eric, some criticism.  And the valid points, some of them.  Except for the legality thing.  We still think we did the right thing there.  I thought listening to the clip, I thought if somebody's driving,  and then even if they say they're drinking and it's them saying it, 
[03:30:30]  I don't think that's really you endorsing anything or saying anything like that.  But he might have been giving you a little bit much on that, yeah.  But did Elo really say that you guys were broadcasting to the entire country of North America?  Yes.  He did say that.  Yes, he did.  So he might be drunk at his desk, right?  Elo, I'll save you the button pushing.  And I got one for you.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame on you.  That's easy. 
[03:31:00]  And this one.  Goddamn rich country.  I wonder if he has that one down there.  That's easy for Eric to say.  He's fucking lounging around there on that continent of Florida.  The worst.  It's the worst.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  The worst.  With Nathaniel.  Holy mackerel am I enjoying that radio program.  Hi, it's Fan of the Opie and Anthony Show.  I'm joined by Sam and Travis of other stuff.  And we're hosting the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show, special holiday edition. 
[03:31:30]  It's Fan's Picks, and Fan being me.  This particular little number is when Jim described his experience trying to convince his lady friend that he wanted his ass eaten and that she should do it.  Ah, yes.  A very informative and crucial bit in the history of the Opie and Anthony Show.  In the mythos, if you will.  Yeah.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[03:32:00]  Here is your line of the day.  Here comes.  La la la la.  Line of the day.  La la la la.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Wait a minute.  You left, like, Thursday.  You haven't seen her in five days.  What could have been the problem?  Not many ways to say this.  Al?  Oh, boy.  I, um, I, I, I, she won't eat my ass until I get tested for hepatitis. 
[03:32:30]  And there is your line of the day.  All right.  All right.  All right, I got to go because I'm going to get my hepatitis test.  He wants his ass eat.  How long does it take?  Once you get it done.  A day or two. 
[03:33:00]  A day or two.  You better do tongue push-ups, baby.  You got a fucking tookus to clean.  So you're calling her out.  Now you're going to get the test back by Friday.  What if there's another excuse?  Then you'll know.  Like the fucking shit log hanging out?  That's what you get for waiting, toots.  Get in there and chew your way to paradise.  Get the test.  It comes back.  Okay.  And then you're going to scrub up.  And then what's the move? 
[03:33:30]  I'm going to walk in.  Here's what I'm going to do.  This is what you're going to hear.  Listen.  Why do you have to actually pull your pants down?  You have to hear this.  Listen.  All right.  Lick, whore.  You're going to have paperwork down.  Jim's going to present like a mandrill.  Like a...  Present.  That red ass.  Pants down like this.  No diseases. 
[03:34:00]  I'm really unpleasant.  Oh, my God.  That would be my ass yelling at her for making it waste.  My ass just has a mind of its own.  Oh, Jesus.  Come on.  I got...  Let it happen.  Come on, Jimmy.  This is making me sad.  That's not even filtered through...  That smells like a hepatitis form.  This is making me sad.  What, this?  The mental death.  Yes, the girl said, whenever I have sadness, not even filtered through the pants. 
[03:34:30]  Happiness comes in and pushes all my sadness out.  You have the paperwork.  Yeah.  Now the pressure's on.  Like, now it's like, here's paperwork.  Lick my ass.  That's why I did that paper spray thing.  Now, what if...  Are you going to ask?  No, I'm going to do this.  Or are you going to wait and see how many days go by?  I'm going to pull them down.  I'm going to bend over.  And when she walks in the room, what do you do?  I'm going to go...  Read it and weep.  If she doesn't, um... 
[03:35:00]  If she doesn't start licking within a week...  A week?  ...of the results.  When are you going to let us know when she licks?  You don't understand something.  Yes.  The ink...  You're still going to be able to smell fresh ink.  She's going to be fucking nose deep in Keister.  You're still going to be able to smell fresh ink.  You should make her do it in the doctor's office after you get the results.  That's exactly...  Or in the cab on the way home.  In the fucking dirty cab.  All you see is a black face leading up and two eyes looking at her in the fucking rear view. 
[03:35:30]  Me with my sweats down.  I won't even lie on my fucking stomach.  I'll lie on my back.  I'll lift my legs up and just hoist my sweats.  And go get licking.  Here I am.  My fucking ass seems to be pressed together like a pussy.  Eat it.  Get in there.  I'm going to take a swan dive into my dumper.  You're going through a lot of trouble to get your ass.  Eat it by your chick.  I don't even know if she'll do it.  She didn't say she didn't do it.  That's just it.  It might be.  Yeah.  The beauty of you is you ran right out to get that test done. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah.  So you're taking away all the things that might keep her from doing it.  Here's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to fucking...  She's going to walk in my room.  I'm going to go, come in here.  It's an emergency.  And she's going to walk in and I'm going to be fucking on my stomach, like on the bed with my asshole being held open with my hands and my results on my back.  So what she'll do is she'll take a quick peek and then she'll get down there and little Jimmy Norton will reap the rewards. 
[03:36:30]  Time to reap the benefits.  The results taped to your back.  It'll be right on my back like a little fucking end table.  Speaking of ends, get in there and let little Jimmy reap the rewards.  I'm just very curious.  Well, I'd like to ask some questions, though.  What'll happen?  I understand you want me to be tested, but I never heard of anyone getting hepatitis on their finger.  Hint.  Oh, just a little diddle. 
[03:37:00]  How about that?  Perhaps for a starter kit.  Exactly.  A starter kit.  Let's work your way up until you're worried about hepatitis on your wrist and then I'll go get a test.  Fuck, is this bullshit?  Who said that he rang up?  The scores told him he rang up.  It was over 50 grand?  Something like that?  Yes.  Over...  Jesus Christ, Jimmy.  What?  Holy shit.  Somebody party.  Somebody party in here.  Oh, my God.  Somebody party in here. 
[03:37:30]  The worst smell ever in my life.  Oh, my God.  It won't go late.  That is disgusting.  That is disgusting.  Disgusting.  Disgusting.  Disgusting.  It's in my nostrils.  Somebody party.  Somebody party in here.  Dude, that's horrific.  Oh, Jesus.  Somebody party in here.  Oh, my God.  Shut up.  I can't function.  It won't stop, stop, stop, stop.  It's awful. 
[03:38:00]  I had a burger on the metro line.  Oh, my God.  I need something I'm going to throw up.  It could be the worst one ever.  It's like rotting eggs.  Eggs.  It's the worst.  The worst.  We'll be back with more of the worst of Obi and Anthony featuring Nathaniel.  The worst.  It's the worst of Obi and Anthony featuring Nathaniel.  It's the worst.  He's reached his potential. 
[03:38:30]  This is as far as he can go.  This is it.  It's the worst of the Obi and Anthony show.  So there's these two gay guys, right, Sam?  Mm-hmm.  This is Stan, by the way, hosting the worst of the Obi and Anthony show.  There's these two gay guys, Gus and Elmer.  Yeah.  Remember them?  Yeah.  They're really old.  Yeah.  So I believe, and I hope somebody lets me know if I'm wrong, this is the time we went  down memory lane with Gus and Elmer and sort of went through the decades of what it would 
[03:39:00]  be like for two gentlemen to be gay for pretty much 70 years, which is how long they were  together.  It would be an interesting time.  It would be a journey, wouldn't it?  It would.  Let's take that journey here on the worst of the Obi and Anthony show.  Ew.  You don't have to be gay.  It's the worst of Obi and Anthony.  Elmer left 84 and Gus 88, who hid their sexual orientation for 58 years, were wed in Canada.  I love these guys. 
[03:39:30]  In the language of their generation, Gus and Elmer were friends.  They worked together, took cruises together, and sang in the same church choir.  They lived together for nearly six decades, but never held hands in public.  Then last month, Gus and Elmer, remember Gus is 88, Elmer is 84, crossed the Canadian  border near Niagara Falls, and they were married.  Wow.  We eloped.  Said in his Manhattan apartment one recent afternoon before breaking into song, to Niagara 
[03:40:00]  and a sleeper, there's no honeymoon, that's cheaper.  Then he paused and his tone shifted.  We waited a long, long time.  Gus and Elmer did not marry for political reasons, financial reasons, or legal reasons.  Through their 58 years together, they mostly stood by as others fought for rights like civil unions or domestic partnerships.  That's great.  It goes on and on.  They met on the beaches of Normandy.  They both took a shot to the head, but it was before they even left the amphibious craft. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah, I like the fact they both stood by.  Gus stood by.  Elmer knelt.  Yikes.  Yeah, I think that Elmer was more of the giver in that.  Yeah, well, turkey neck.  Oh, God.  Nothing sadder than two old queens, especially when they become one.  Just one old queen.  One of my favorite gay observations comes from Anthony about the act that gay men do. 
[03:41:00]  Yes.  And Anthony says, leave it to the young.  Just leave it to the young.  Gay sex.  I'm not talking about gay love, either.  Right.  I'm not talking about gay.  Like old married couples, men and women.  Right.  Sometimes they go years.  They don't have sex anymore.  They're just, you know, they live together.  They do whatever.  Gay guys might be the same thing.  I don't know.  You know, a little peck on the cheek. 
[03:41:30]  One's off to work.  One's doing this.  Whatever.  But the, I'm talking the hardcore gay sex.  Please leave it to the young.  It just should be left to young men.  Because old guys doing that.  Wow.  Wowie.  That just, heebie-jeebies.  Leave it for the young.  It's one of my favorites.  Do you think it's creepy if they're kissing in the middle of it?  Yes.  Dude, one really dry mouth due to medication. 
[03:42:00]  Well, I...  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  One mouth is wet and moist.  Oh, my.  His biotene toothpaste.  Oh, my.  Biotene.  And the other is very dry with that white stuff in the corner there.  Oh, no.  Oh.  Because otherwise his heart doesn't work properly.  Oh, my God.  You know, dry breath.  You get dry breath.  You open your mouth and you get white spittle.  Oh.  Teeth sitting in a glass on the night table. 
[03:42:30]  Well, at one point, yeah.  Just put them in the glass.  Yeah, put them in the glass.  You know how I love it when your teeth are in the glass.  That's how he knows it's about to get...  When he hears the fizz of the efferent.  He knows actions are coming.  Yeah.  The zipper comes right down and he hears the...  Of those stupid teeth having blueberry stains removed from them.  Just the thought of one guy laying in the bed all, like, excited and ready to go.  And then the other guy taking off his Fred Mertz pants. 
[03:43:00]  Gonna have some fun tonight.  Aren't we, Rick?  Thank God we brought back Gus and Elmer today, man.  Gus and Elmer.  Oh, one of our favorite stories in the last year or two.  Good old Gus and Elmer.  84 and 88, still going strong.  Yeah, they are.  Actually, this was a year ago, so now we're talking Gus is 89 and Elmer's 85.  Elmer.  Or Gus gets stuck to Elmer because his fizzident, the adhesive fizzident just gets stuck. 
[03:43:30]  So he has to open his friend's mouth and dump in, like, hot coffee.  Or something that will loosen the fizzident.  It's like pulling a bottom-feeding catfish off the side of your tank.  Oh, you got a picture of them in the 40s?  Oh, wait.  There they are.  Being chased by a mob.  Trying to hide, yeah.  Strapping young men in this picture.  Look at that.  Hubba, hubba.  Look at the stems on that broad.  Oh, I hope they don't kill us.  That's pretty much where they were at.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  Now they were trying to act like they like women.  Look at the stems on that broad. 
[03:44:00]  Nice stems.  23 skidoo.  She sure is beautiful.  Right.  Here we go.  And here are two men.  They're getting off the boat now.  Gus and Elmer.  You boys have now won the war.  The war is over.  You're here in Times Square having a gay time.  That means happy.  It's the 40s.  Why are you giving me a weird look just because I said gay time?  I said a gay time.  The whole city is gay.  Isn't the city gay now that we've won the war? 
[03:44:30]  Look, people are dancing and singing in gay fashion.  And here's Gus and Elmer really being gay.  The reporter notices that Gus and Elmer are the only ones not going for the kiss.  Yes, wait a minute.  Gus is in a sailor suit and Elmer's wearing a dress.  They're kissing in Times Square.  It certainly is a gay mood here in Times Square.  I now pronounce you Elmer and Gus. 
[03:45:00]  Hysterical movie from the 40s.  They're running from a mob of intolerant people who want to beat them because they're gay.  Chasing them with pitchforks and torches.  Thank God they got thrown off the track because they found a couple of Negroes eyeballing a white woman.  Run, boys, run.  All right, listen.  We have just begun with this.  We're not going to let go of Gus and Elmer anytime soon today. 
[03:45:30]  No.  They probably said each of these names in the middle of it.  You know, they did.  Like, not even like, oh, yeah.  Like the one had sweat dripping off his face into the eyes and mouth of the other one.  Oh, God.  You know, he's an older man and the medication makes him sweat.  Medication.  Gus.  Elmer.  What are you, Elmer?  You think they go to Sam's Club for Viagra?  Just a big...  A big barrel of it.  They scoop in like when you're a kid and you put a quarter in and a thing goes into the machine and picks up a toy. 
[03:46:00]  His old man hand just scoops in there.  It's got fecal matter on his finger.  Jesus.  I mean, what?  He's an older gentleman.  He gets nervous.  He's in a rush.  I don't know how to quit you.  Hey, they fought.  Back Mountain because his back really is sore.  It really hurts.  They fought for our country, guys.  It's the worst. 
[03:46:30]  Well, Elmer and Gus.  Are they gay couples?  Well, now they're up to 59 years together.  This is the update on Elmer and Gus.  Leave gay to the young.  And one of them is 89 and one is 84.  No, 85 or 86.  What were they hiding from back then, though?  Like, no one knew anyone was gay back then.  No one knew.  Even like Rock Hudson went how many years before anyone even figured out he was gay?  Right.  Well, no one knows people are gay.  They just think they're friends. 
[03:47:00]  If they've been together 59 years, that brings us to what?  1948-ish?  Dude.  Right?  1948, you're hiding your gay?  You're hiding your gayness.  No one would notice.  They would look at it like all pleasant.  Oh, no one would.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Yeah, they wouldn't, like, accuse them of being gay.  They would just think that's what they do.  Oh, okay.  Well, why don't we cue the music and why don't we go through the years with Gus and Elmer.  It's just a wonderful thing.  The Gus and Elmer story. 
[03:47:30]  Fresh back from the war.  Gus and Elmer move into a new Levitt home in Levittown.  One of these wonderful one-bedroom homes.  I guess just to save money.  They're living together.  Split the bills.  Those two are inseparable.  They seem to do everything together.  Splitting the bills.  And, boy, are they friendly with the neighbors.  The neighbors seem to love them. 
[03:48:00]  Their house is impeccable.  And decorated to the nines.  If that's even a term back then.  To the nines.  No one is raising an eyebrow.  Whatsoever.  What?  This is the first I've ever heard them call curtains window treatments.  What does that even mean?  For Gus and Elmer, it means lots of color.  And a gay atmosphere in the house.  You know, happy.  That's right.  Gay men's happy back in the 40s, late 40s. 
[03:48:30]  Then they moved to Queens for a while.  Just seemed to like the name of that town, I guess.  But that was short-lived because they soon moved to San Francisco.  Oh, boy.  Ah.  Yes, here they are in Frisco.  In the 60s. 
[03:49:00]  The 60s in Frisco.  Oh, damn.  What happened to the 50s?  Yeah, well, I was hoping you, uh...  Wait a minute.  They don't leave New York yet.  All right.  Let's go back.  All right.  Let's go back to the 40s music.  Look.  It's off the cuff.  Okay.  Other radio guys do this when they're off the air.  We like to do it live.  All right.  So...  Here they are at a dance.  They're a couple of wallflowers.  They don't seem to be dancing with any girls.  Do you want to go into the 50s now?  Ah, a new decade for Gus and Elma. 
[03:49:30]  There you go.  The 50s.  There you go.  I don't think blue moon, moon, moon, moon.  Oh, blue moon.  Hmm.  Why are they arguing?  Who is this moon gentleman?  Are you cheating on me?  I don't even know what that means.  But they do seem very happy together.  I don't think blue moon, moon, moon, moon.  No, no, Elma.  It's a sock up. 
[03:50:00]  Yes, the 50s.  They sure did enjoy it.  But that quickly turned to the turbulent 60s.  Ah, yeah.  Well, I believe now they pack up the old car.  And head out to San Francisco.  And head out to San Francisco.  Yes.  Yes.  Mr. Voice Guy, there seems to be a lot more Gus and Elmers in San Francisco.  Yes.  Any suspicion yet?  They sure are getting along with everybody. 
[03:50:30]  Cleanliness is next to godliness.  They seem to visit a bathhouse every day.  Yes, flowers in your hair.  But what's that in your mouth, Gus?  Wow, what queer fashions they wear.  Wow.  Well, I'm talking about the time.  You know, queer means unusual.  Not what it's going to mean in the future. 
[03:51:00]  Space travel.  Of course.  Any suspicion yet, Mr. Voice Guy?  Suspicion of what?  Uh-oh.  These two gentlemen get along lovely.  Especially with all the folks in San Francisco.  Joining the flower generation.  The flower people.  Yeah.  Flower power.  And again, they're sharing an apartment.  They sure are economical.  What's up with the tie-dyed shirts, though, Mr. Voice Guy?  Well, they seem to like that.  But neither of them, and it might be because of the war, can seem to hold down a relationship with a woman. 
[03:51:30]  They're always seen together.  Out at the same bars.  You know, the ramrod around the corner.  Or the mineshaft.  Not many ladies at those bars.  I'm a little worried they won't settle down and make a family for themselves.  They should go to more dances.  Well, and then we move into the... 
[03:52:00]  They sure are groovy.  We're going to move into the 70s now.  And for some reason, Gus and Elmer have decided to pack their bags and move to New York City.  Back to New York.  In the 70s.  For Gus and Elmer.  Yes.  They are getting a bit older.  And their skin must be drying out because what I see is a lot of lubricant around their apartment.  Here in the city.  Again, trying to find love with the ladies, but no luck at all. 
[03:52:30]  At this place called Studio 54.  They sure aren't dancing a lot.  That keeps them in shape.  And I guess the club is hot because they're shirtless.  I don't understand.  They don't seem to be equestrians, yet they wear chaps.  And you couldn't wear that on a horse.  That could make you chafe a bit.  One of them is suggesting a song. 
[03:53:00]  ABBA's Dancing Queen.  Through history.  With Gus and Elmer.  There they go.  You can dance.  Having the time of your life.  Is the word gay gay yet?  Yeah.  Because they're having a gay time.  Oh, boy.  They're still having a gay time.  Oh, okay.  Let's say they're happy. 
[03:53:30]  Yeah.  Married.  But the situation is a bit queer.  To me.  That's good.  Oh, little did they see that happening in the 70s.  I was all innocent.  What seems to have snuck in there.  Right.  Oh, so tiny.  So small an organism.  Yikes.  That'll cause some problems in the future.  Yes. 
[03:54:00]  Oh, you know, it's the end of the 70s.  And quite the backlash.  Everyone's saying, disco sucks.  Disco sucks.  And so does Gus.  Ah.  After that little bacteria virus gets in there.  Stayin' alive takes on a whole new meaning.  Well, we're into the 80s there, Mr. Boy Scott.  Oh, look how old Gus and Elmer are getting.  Oh, boy.  Ah, not much whamming going on at the old Gus and Elmer house. 
[03:54:30]  They're settling down now.  Usually you can find them dressed in a robe,  drinking broth,  and petting their little Yorkshire terrier.  These two bachelors are still on the prowl for ladies.  You're still buying into that, Mr. Voice Guy?  Of course I am.  Why am I still from the 40s? 
[03:55:00]  I got another song for you there, Mr. Voice Guy.  A little Tainted Love.  Tainted Love?  Yeah, well.  What an appropriate song.  Yes.  Gus and Elmer sure do love their cock.  Oops.  I got for the new technology called a dump button.  Right, well.  That's what Gus calls it.  The dump button. 
[03:55:30]  A little Tainted Love.  And now as we enter the 90s,  oh, we see Gus and Elmer.  Barely a mere shell of their former selves.  Well, they must have a nice gym membership.  They're keeping in shape there.  They might be going to the gym a little too much.  No?  What?  Gus seems to be too sexy for his depend undercomments,  because he's running around the house nude.  Gus is too sexy for this hospital bed. 
[03:56:00]  Too sexy for this hospital bed.  Now let's look far into the future.  Oh, boy.  Past where they are now.  Yeah.  Who is that, Gus I see?  Kneeling by a tombstone.  Oh, you had to go there.  Oh.  Look.  His knees. 
[03:56:30]  They're so skinny and thin,  they're sinking into the mud over the grave.  Poor Gus.  Poor Elmer.  But they led a good life.  Maybe all they needed was a woman to settle down with.  Philadelphia?  As they move back to Philadelphia.  Two men dedicated to each other.  For almost 60 years.  Yes.  The story of Gus and Elmer. 
[03:57:00]  What an odd decorating technique in their houses.  Why are the bastards upside down?  Do we have a message here, Mr. Voice Guy?  Yes, there's always a message.  Yeah.  In the end, what's the message?  As far as Gus and Elmer go.  Get a girl or wear a bag.  Gus and Elmer, always riding bareback. 
[03:57:30]  Boy, this ends depressing.  Yeah, no kidding.  We were having fun.  What the hell, man?  Well, it always does, doesn't it?  We're having a little fun there.  With somebody having to take care of the dog.  Poor confused little dog.  Used to two laps.  Jump in.  Only has one.  Hey, if you want to do it.  Just one uncomfortable bony lap.  The worst.  It's the worst.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  The worst.  With Nathaniel. 
[03:58:00]  Holy mackerel, am I enjoying that radio program.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm fan hosting this segment.  Now, Sam, we've recognized some themes of my picks, so I bet you're going to be able to pick this one.  It's not retards.  It's not E-Rock.  So it's going to be Master Poe.  Master Poe.  That's correct.  This is when Master Poe apparently was messing with Anthony's on-star.  Yes.  And either changed his whole address book or ended up calling the cops or something. 
[03:58:30]  He has trouble with buttons.  There's so many sometimes.  Yeah.  We're going to get to the bottom of it here on the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  I also had a great time driving home yesterday.  What happened?  Hopefully you got pulled over again.  No, no, no.  Not pulled over.  Apparently, I didn't really take much interest in a story that was being told to me walking into the building yesterday from Master Poe.  Master Poe. 
[03:59:00]  Apparently, when he adjusts my rear-view mirror, which I have to have done probably 10,000 times in my vehicle,  and somehow he's constantly hitting my on-star buttons.  He's constantly hitting them, I think just to converse with somebody.  Hello, on-star.  Did you explain that you drive into the city and you get out and then Master Poe just helps you out and takes your car a mere block?  Yeah, a block and a half.  And half the time, you get the car back and there's always some weird problem with it. 
[03:59:30]  Like, all of a sudden, there's a lot of Spanish stations on your radio.  Yeah, yeah, Spanish stations.  All programmed in.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's Spanish stations on there.  The mirrors are all adjusted.  The seat height has changed.  Just to drive a little over a block.  Once, my navigation system was set for Ohio.  I'm not kidding.  And I'm not making any accusations here.  I'm just saying once I got into my car and it was set for Ohio. 
[04:00:00]  Yeah.  So, I don't know what that was all about.  So, he said yesterday while we were walking in, he goes, oh, I accidentally hit your on-star again.  I was like, oh my, and then I'm thinking, oh my God, what button?  Because there's, you know, there's the red cross button on there which instantly gets the emergency service.  And then there's a white button which you hit and it's a built-in phone and it's voice activated.  So, it's completely hands-free.  It says, number please, and I'll say something like, Jimmy Norton. 
[04:00:30]  And then it'll say, calling, Jimmy Norton.  And then Jimmy Norton gets called from my car.  Well, I go to call my girl, so I hit the button and it goes, number please, and I say, baby.  Because that's what I have around there.  Oh, that's adorable.  My baby.  So, I go, baby.  And it goes, calling, Opie.  So, I quickly hit the button.  Because that's just creepy. 
[04:01:00]  Yeah, I hit the button.  On so many levels.  So, I go, well, I must have said it wrong because sometimes the voice recognition doesn't pick up right.  So, I hit it again and it says, number.  And I say, baby, calling, Opie.  It's like, this is really creepy.  And, of course, the third time it happens again.  Baby, calling, Opie.  Then I just, like, hung up, realized what must have happened.  Somehow, baby got erased from the memory on my car. 
[04:01:30]  So, I had to reinstall baby.  Yeah, but you got a new baby.  New baby.  It's Opie.  It was so, like, I was getting mad at my vehicle for mocking me.  It's like, calling, baby, calling Opie.  You homo.  Like, no, I'm not calling Opie.  Opie is not my baby.  Where's my baby?  No, I don't have onqueer.  It's on-star.  It wasn't calling. 
[04:02:00]  Baby wasn't in the vehicle.  It had been extracted.  And all I could think, because Master Poe is then telling me.  So, I hit the button.  And I'm saying, like, no.  It goes, you know, because would you like to place a call?  Number.  And he's going, no.  Stop.  Eject.  But he's just saying things into the on-star thing.  And it's not understanding him.  So, I'm just thinking, at some point, he said, must have said delete or something like it. 
[04:02:30]  And it just deleted baby from the memory.  And it's just constantly something.  I get in there.  My seat's all the way back.  I got to pull it up 20 feet.  He drives a lousy block, block in half with your car every day.  Oh, man.  That's funny.  It is something.  Hey, Master Poe, what's going on?  Good morning, Opie.  Good morning.  Ah, Master Poe.  You know, when we were walking in yesterday, you were explaining the on-star thing.  And we kind of reached the office before you really gave me the details of what happened. 
[04:03:00]  And I started thinking, he said that he hit the on-star.  And that, like, something happened.  And you were trying to get it to stop.  But then we kind of didn't finish the story.  How did that end?  What happened with the on-star?  Well, I was just trying to stop him from talking.  I kept on talking.  It asked me what phone number I wanted to dial.  And I said, I don't want to dial the number.  You said that.  I'm saying no.  He's talking to my car. 
[04:03:30]  He's trying to stop him from talking.  What are you, in the mafia?  Master Poe is skilled in martial arts, but, you know, he's scared of Anthony's car.  He doesn't know how to take on a car yet.  I would have put your car in a choke hole.  And that would have shut it up.  Basically, Anthony wants you to stop fiddling with his buttons.  Master Poe likes to fiddle.  Just stop fiddling.  He's fiddling.  He presses the ones that he thinks are pretty, like the red cross. 
[04:04:00]  Have you ever hit the emergency button on the on-star?  The emergency button?  Yeah.  Where the live person comes on and chats with you?  No, I've never done that.  Why?  You want me to?  No, no.  I was just wondering, because I remember a time back you hit a button,  and I believe it was the live person that actually came on.  Why are you just hitting all these buttons to drive a block?  You know, I'm not too sure.  I tend to hit things. 
[04:04:30]  Just stop fiddling.  He's fiddling.  He's fiddling.  People are saying, I should have an ejection seat button.  I put, like, a big thing on it that just says, push here with a smiley face.  All right.  So how did that end?  Because somehow my girlfriend's number got taken out of my vehicle's memory.  Oh, I'm sorry. 
[04:05:00]  I don't know.  It was talking, and I said no.  I kept on saying no, and finally it decided to stop talking.  He's fighting your car every morning.  It's a battle.  It's a battle.  It's the Escalade against Poe in a no-holds-barred match.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  No!  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Is that Poe in my car?  Yeah, just losing it. 
[04:05:30]  Hey, all right, Poe, we got to take a break.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Anthony was very polite how he talked about this on the air.  You should hear him behind the scenes, though, man.  It's ugly.  Behind the scenes?  Behind the scenes.  It's ugly what he's saying.  Poe's a born killer.  He just protects me on the street.  He just wants you to stop fiddling.  Fiddling.  All right, Poe.  I'll make sure I don't touch anything anymore.  All right, there he goes.  Master Poe.  Why?  Yeah! 
[04:06:00]  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Master Poe, and with all due respect, Poe, you kind of would run after a female dog because  it's female.  Wow.  You're kind of known around this place to be a little flirtatious, to look at a lot of  the girls and stuff, so it's hard to really gauge how much, you know, if you're just being  Poe. 
[04:06:30]  Let's just put it this way.  He does a lot of his dating in the back parking lot at FH Ryan.  Oh, shit.  Jesus.  Why is everyone looking away?  Okay.  Wow.  Yeah, Poe, the FH doesn't mean fuck here.  No, you didn't!  No, you didn't!  It's the worst.  The worst.  We'll be back with more of the worst of Opie and Anthony featuring Nathaniel. 
[04:07:00]  Lady, lady.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The worst.  It's the worst.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  The worst.  With Nathaniel.  Holy mackerel, am I enjoying that radio program!  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  I'm Than, and I'll be picking all your bits that are airing today.  This is called ONA TV Edits. 
[04:07:30]  Oh, yes, I love this.  This actually started a whole thing.  A whole lot of listeners were sending them in.  Yeah.  But this, I mean, it never got better than this first.  Thank you, Sam, of the Than and Sam Show.  It's my pleasure.  And, Travis, what do you got?  ThanandSam.com.  Catch it.  This bit is when we took some classic parts of the Opie and Anthony Show that we had in  the old treasure trove and re-edited them so that they would be safe for broadcast television.  These are good.  Your kids can listen.  Yeah. 
[04:08:00]  And we encourage them to.  Family bit.  Responsibly.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  We're going to do an ONA TV edit thing.  Yeah, I want to hear this.  This is Jimmy?  Jim Norton talking to Dragon Wagon, I think.  The famous Dragon Wagon bit.  Yeah.  No, no, no, no.  What?  What is it, Hawk?  Oh, Hawk.  Hawk.  Oh, he went with the other one?  What have you done?  No, they said they might go with the other one.  This is, uh.  But it's Hawk's fault.  It is.  It always is.  It is.  I'm always taking mics away from the guests. 
[04:08:30]  Why are there eight people walking in here while you remove a mic from an anchor?  Uh, here we go.  Hold on.  No, but that's his son.  Show respect to his son.  Talk into mine.  Mind, sir?  No, no, talk into mine.  All right, so the Dragon Wagon was a little too.  Dragon Wagon was a little too long and didn't have enough variety in the language.  Okay.  Dragon Wagon went with a different bit that Danny selected.  What bit is this?  Oh, I'll look at it.  Now, wait a minute.  That just was very telling.  I know what that is.  Nathaniel is not confident in this at all.  I have the utmost confidence.  No, you said which Danny chose. 
[04:09:00]  But there's some, you know, discussion as to who contributed to what and people not getting  credit, and I think Danny selected an excellent bit.  You would absolutely not give Danny credit.  No.  You wouldn't say you did it if he didn't do it, but you wouldn't step up and actually  give him the credit.  I have the utmost confidence in this.  All right.  What's the bit?  It's a Jim yelling at a caller that just said he wasn't funny.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  And it's done in the TV edit style.  You know how they put movies on regular television. 
[04:09:30]  They got to edit out the language, and a lot of times they use ridiculous words for the  curses.  The voice is different.  The ambient noise in the background is different, and it's ridiculous.  Right.  And we just decided to try one of these with a little segment of our show.  All right.  Here's Jim Norton, the original line.  Wait.  Hey, guys.  Oh, you killed him.  Nathaniel wanted to say something.  Did he?  No.  It's okay.  Oh, he was going to talk into the microphone.  But he was going to talk into the mic.  You got me so bad.  No, he actually was trying to talk into the mic, and he got shy, and he walked away.  All right.  Here's the original dialogue. 
[04:10:00]  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Long time listener.  Glad to have you back.  Jeff, welcome to the program.  Hey, you got to tell you.  You got to get rid of Norton.  Dump this guy because he sucks.  What?  Uh-oh.  That was the first line?  That's the first line, and now we're going to clean it up.  We're going to clean it up for TV.  Wow.  Steve, you have confidence in this?  Green Goblin face made a really good choice in there, didn't he?  Dumbbell.  Did you have picked one with profanity in it, Daniel? 
[04:10:30]  All right.  It's just the first one.  But the whole point is you got to clean it up, and there's nothing wrong with it.  I'm thinking sucks.  All right, Steve, explain yourself.  We used, if I may make a local reference, Channel 11 rules with profanity.  Where they couldn't use sucks?  Can't use sucks.  All right, let's listen to the original.  All right, one more time.  I just got confused because I didn't know what they were going to redo here.  Hey, guys, how you doing?  Long time listening.  Glad to have you back.  Jeff, welcome to the program. 
[04:11:00]  Hey, you got to tell you, you got to get rid of Norton.  Dump this guy because he sucks.  What?  All right, so that's the original.  What a dope.  I am greeting him happily.  Yeah, I know.  Asshole.  You feel stupid.  I hope he's dead.  And here's that same line cleaned up for Channel 11.  Local broadcast.  Local broadcast.  Hey, guys, how you doing?  Long time listening.  Glad to have you back.  Love you.  Jeff, welcome to the program.  Hey, you got to tell you, you got to get rid of Norton.  Dump this guy because he stinks. 
[04:11:30]  What?  All right.  I kind of like it.  It was very good execution, by the way.  The sound was a little off.  The voice wasn't the same.  But his attitude was the same.  You tried to actually get the guy's angry attitude.  This is actually a lot harder than you'd think because you have to sit there and say it exactly how Norton delivers the line.  All right.  Forget it.  You really need to explain.  Jesus. 
[04:12:00]  All right, here's the result.  My motivation was.  I know.  Every time he opens his mouth, he drains the funny from the room.  Whoa, easy there, Jeff.  I got to tell you, hey, Norton.  Bob Kelly was on the other day.  I couldn't tell the difference between him and you.  Get a new shtick, buddy.  You stole it from him.  You're a one-trick pony.  Yeah, your mother's a one-trick pony, too.  When I give her money, she sucks my dick and eats my ass.  You fucking fan with an opinion. 
[04:12:30]  Your mother's a trick-turning pony.  She sucks horse cock while bad 70s music plays.  And then funny little troll.  God, Jim, just proving that he's actually funny there.  Wow.  That's not really what I meant to say.  No.  No.  Just kind of slipped out.  A little harsh.  Well, Steve cleans this up for a local broadcast.  Every time he opens his mouth, he drains the funny from the room.  Whoa, easy there, Jeff.  I got to tell you, hey, Norton, Bob Kelly was on the other day.  I couldn't tell the difference between him and you. 
[04:13:00]  Get a new shtick, buddy.  You stole it from him.  You're a one-trick pony.  Yeah, your mother's a one-trick pony, too.  When I give her money, she sucks my shoes and heeds my words.  You flipping fern with an opinion.  Your mother's a tried-and-true pony.  She sings punk rock while bad 70s music plays.  You're an unfunny little troll.  All right, I'm standing up for all of you.  Wow, wow.  Martini's team.  Very good.  Oh, wow.  That is perfect.  That's exactly how they do it in the movies. 
[04:13:30]  That's exactly how they do it in the movies.  Because you have to read, you have to exactly figure out Jimmy's delivery the original time.  Run through that a few times.  Holy crap, that's funny.  Think of what you'd be looking at on a screen and then think of words that would match up with what he's saying.  All the bad fake curses and everything.  Bad, that don't make sense.  What did I say last one?  Your mother does what with a pony?  The finalist.  I forgot.  Fern?  I think there was a fern in there, too.  Yeah, there was a fern reference.  Fern.  Wait, I can play the last, uh...  Yeah.  You know these Denons, right?  You can play the last five seconds of the track? 
[04:14:00]  No?  It's your still records.  Every time he...  You flipping fern with an opinion.  Your mother's a tried-and-true pony.  She sings punk rock while bad 70s music plays.  You're an unfunny little troll.  That is really good.  Sings punk rock.  That's really good.  If I had any real sense of humor, that's what I would have said to begin with.  Yes!  That would have shown him.  All right, let's, uh...  Here's the original line.  There's more to this bit.  You are an unfunny little troll, buddy. 
[04:14:30]  That's the best you have?  Unfunny little troll?  I say your mother sucks pony dick on film, and you call me a troll?  Do I trip-trap under a bridge?  Drop dead, motherfucker.  All right.  Let's see how Steve cleaned this up for a local broadcast.  Do you have to do this with a news anchor here?  I'm a little embarrassed and ashamed of my potty mouth.  You are an unfunny little troll, buddy.  That's the best you have?  Unfunny little troll?  I say your mother strips furniture on film, and you call me a troll? 
[04:15:00]  Do I trip-trap under a bridge?  Drop dead, Mr. Falcon.  Hey, he stole that from Die Hard 2.  That's great.  Wow.  Steve, you've got to do another one.  We will.  We will.  You've hit a home run here.  Okay.  Let's say hi to Vic in Connecticut.  Vic?  Vic?  Hey, Vic.  What's happening?  Hey.  I don't usually call shows, but that was awesome. 
[04:15:30]  Unbelievable.  I'm cracking up, and Mr. Falcon, unbelievable.  All right, thanks.  Martini Steve's best bit ever from Philly.  Look at this.  They're loving it.  That was a good one, man.  Well, there's still a little more here before we end the show.  I'm not a professional.  You're a professional.  You're not a professional.  You're a fucking nobody.  You're an anonymous zero.  All right, and now cleaned up for local broadcast.  I'm not a professional.  You're a professional.  You're not a professional.  You're a faking nobody.  You're an anonymous zero.  Faking.  Faking. 
[04:16:00]  That really does.  You've definitely hit on what they do on television.  Here's the original dialogue.  I may suck, but your mother swallows and takes it on the face.  Hey, my mother may take it on the face, but at least she's funnier than you, motherfucker.  She's not funnier than me.  The only thing funnier about her is she's a woman with a cock.  That's what's funny about your mother.  And she dangles it over your father's face like a Roman war helmet.  How the hell are you going to clean up this one?  Oh, my goodness. 
[04:16:30]  This was the most challenging bit we had.  Yes.  Nathaniel and I both did VO parts in this one.  I may stink, but your mother swats flies and shaves her face.  My mother might shave her face, but at least she's funnier than you, Mike Foxtrot.  She's not funnier than me.  The only thing funnier about her is she's a woman with a beard.  That's what's funny about your mother.  And she dangles it over your father's face like a rug from Persia.  I like Nathaniel.  I had to play the part of the angry caller.  Anyone else pick up on that? 
[04:17:00]  Very good.  Very good.  All right.  We're running out of show.  We want to get to the end of this.  The original dialogue.  You're the worst, man.  I may be the worst, but I'm well paid and you're a listener.  So sit there, boy, and listen.  Put on your headphones and listen, little fella.  I drain the funny out of a room.  The way your mother drains semen out of black cocks.  Where'd he go?  I don't think he could take it.  By the way, the CNBC anchor left, I don't know, a half hour ago at least. 
[04:17:30]  You blame him?  At least.  All right.  Here is that same dialogue cleaned up for TV.  You're the worst, man.  I may be the worst, but I'm well paid and you're a listener.  So sit there, boy, and listen.  Put on your headphones and listen, little fella.  I drain the funny out of a room the way your mother drinks seltzer on the rocks.  Where'd he go?  I don't think he could take it. 
[04:18:00]  Excellent.  Wow.  I do like it.  Unbelievable, Steve.  Thank you, Nathaniel, as well.  This was a group effort.  Ah.  Speaking of the TV editing, we're also taking Opie and Anthony bits and trying to clean  them up for TV and for maybe commercial radio.  You know, it's a dream, Opie.  Maybe commercial radio will hear our show and want to take us on, but we're a little  dirty.  We're a little blue.  A little salty, our language.  A little salty.  And why not just clean it up like they do with movies? 
[04:18:30]  Yeah.  Movies seem to be, people seem to watch them on TBS and the WB and stuff like that.  And they enjoy it.  Why can't we do that with this program?  Right.  Cover up our salty language in the same way they do these movies.  Throw in stupid words for curse words.  Fake curses.  With fake curses.  Bad copies of the voice that originally did it.  Bad studio ambient sounds.  Yeah.  Works in the movies.  Why can't it work for us?  All right.  So we got two more today, by the way.  Two more.  From Steve. 
[04:19:00]  And who else helped Steve out on these?  Oh.  Nathaniel?  Than?  Yeah.  I think he likes to be called Than.  Than?  I'm starting to call him Than.  I can't do that.  I wouldn't at gunpoint.  No.  I cannot do the Than thing.  You know, my nickname is absolutely horrendous.  What is it?  I hate it.  Baby cock?  Opie.  Baby.  Oh, my God.  I've been Opie since 12 fucking years old.  Yeah.  And now that I'm an older gentleman, I fucking hate it.  Opie's a big girl.  But I think Than is even worse. 
[04:19:30]  Than.  Because it's a nickname shortened from Nathaniel.  Yeah, but Than is like a nickname you give like an Asian fella.  He's not Asian.  Like, Than.  Look, because it's a part of his name.  Like, my nickname is Carrier.  Yeah.  But like, that's not taken from my name.  Opie's not taken from your name.  Hawk is not taken from his name.  No.  Than.  Got a guy down there in the sewer.  Not Birnbaum.  He don't know how to spell it, Than.  I guess my parents just wanted to be different. 
[04:20:00]  And it stuck.  Yeah.  Do you like being called Than?  Than is an Asian name, by the way.  Yeah.  It sounds very Asian.  You're like 6'4 and white.  Yes.  Yeah.  I thought that notion was funny enough to write stand-up about it.  Yes, I've seen your act.  And that is very funny.  It's very funny.  And the rest of the country got to hear that one day.  Remember?  Lucky them.  That was a big day for you.  Lucky them.  All right.  Did you help us, Steve, with these?  Yeah.  These edits?  The fake swear brainstorming sessions are quite fun. 
[04:20:30]  Yeah.  I could picture these two just in the studio all alone, late at night here at the studio.  Putting in some late hours, are you?  No.  No, not at all.  No.  It's still before noon when you leave.  Dude, you know, I used to vision this place like the reality is Anthony and I and little  Jimmy.  What did I do?  Oh, what did I do?  Nothing.  I just think it's cool that when you vision a place, I think it's important to see it  like that.  No, I think it's great that you vision a place.  Sorry.  No, why?  I think it's great.  We both just thought that was impressive. 
[04:21:00]  Well, I have this vision.  Yes.  Thank you.  Of this place, actually.  What's wrong with that?  You said I used to vision this place.  Instead of envision.  Oh, okay.  Basically, here's the deal.  We leave right at 11.  Yeah, jot that one down.  Yeah, they jot it down.  Of course they do.  Finger, finger, finger.  Bombs and flubs.  Part two on the way.  All right.  I picture this place.  How's that?  Oh, thank you.  We leave at 11, 11.15. 
[04:21:30]  Yeah.  And I picture this place, just a work environment, people running around like busy bees and like  the ants trying to build the little anthill.  I'm starting to think at 11.10 when we leave, someone goes downstairs, makes sure the coast  is clear and everyone clears out.  I think they all just look.  Are they here?  Are they here?  There was a time I really thought that these guys were staying to 5.6 at night, helping  us prepare for the show.  Now I'm suspicious.  Now we stay late.  I mean, I'm thinking they might clear out by 11.20. 
[04:22:00]  What time do you guys get out of here on an average day?  I'd say 1.30.  1.30.  And they're all nodding their heads.  Yeah, yeah.  Fair enough.  Yeah, but they can't even commit to the nod.  Look at them.  Yeah, yeah.  I know.  We'll say 1.  No.  And then Derek holds up his finger saying it's more like 1, which means it's more like  12.30.  Travis put on this serious face and he's nodding his head like, yeah, yeah, 1.30, yes, yes.  I believe it is 1.30.  Some days later, some days earlier, yeah, yeah. 
[04:22:30]  No, the reality, I'm trying to do a bit here.  These guys work ridiculous hours.  When does stupid Ben leave?  He's here all day.  Is he?  Steve, do you know when Ben leaves?  Ben and I usually leave around the same time, so it's 1-ish, 1.30.  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  1-ish, 1.30 now.  1-ish, 1.30.  So it could be 12.45 some days.  Steve, you want the listeners to email you fake curses?  That could help the process.  Sure, go ahead.  Because Stan was saying that, you know, the challenges coming up with these, you know, 
[04:23:00]  fake curses during these brainstorming sessions.  You know what, that would actually help if they could help us to come up with variations  or, you know, fake curses for, you know, the standard ones.  Because we're running out of things that we could possibly use.  Right.  Okay.  As may or may not become apparent.  Yeah.  But the guys, you know, put together a couple more O&A edits.  The first one is Anthony.  Oh, what did I do?  It's the famous, oh, I was busting his ball today.  Where's that? 
[04:23:30]  Oh, no.  Well, because, you know, someone noticed that Anthony can't say finger right or whatever?  Finger.  I don't know what it is.  Now I'm so flustered with the word, I don't even use it anymore.  That's what happened.  I say my digit.  That's what happened with me with the boot.  Boot?  Yeah.  Yeah, but boot's hard to replace with something else.  I try.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Put.  Are you going to place the lotion in the basket?  I guess so.  Is it finger?  Finger.  Finger.  Finger.  Finger.  Finger.  Finger.  Finger.  Don't try so hard, though. 
[04:24:00]  Yeah, you do just a soft G.  Finger.  Finger?  I don't know how to say it now.  Finger.  Finger.  Finger.  Finger.  And then I say it, and I think it's normal, and I get laughed at.  It's like you're turning a G upside down.  Finger.  Dude.  Finger.  And we're such assholes.  There's a story in the paper.  Where is it?  Finger.  I thought I cut it out.  Finger.  Finger.  Because I was going to do something with that today.  I put my finger in her eye.  Finger.  I put my finger.  Finger.  Yeah.  That's how you do it.  That's hard.  Linger.  Finger.  Finger.  Finger.  Maybe I left it.  Finger. 
[04:24:30]  Now the word's completely lost any meaning, and it just sounds silly when  you say it.  Rowab.  Jimmy, this happened before you came in.  We're such asses.  There's an article in the paper.  Yeah, Obi's being smartass in the office.  I wish I could find it really fast.  Hawk, find that article.  It's the cute article.  I go, Ann, I got something on this story I want you to set me up, you know?  Which we talk about stuff like that, you know, before the show.  I go, could you set me up as far as this article goes?  And I just show it to him.  Oh, you got it? 
[04:25:00]  Ah.  So I just hold this up like this.  Yeah, I just hold this up like this.  Read that.  Man 21 fingered at his scooter cop shooter.  We won't even talk about this story, but it was me just busting his balls.  He doesn't understand where I'm going yet.  Finger.  Then he sees finger, and he just.  Finger.  Finger.  Loses his mind.  Finger.  Man 21 fingered.  You know something?  I don't know how I get through so many years of living, and no one's ever pointed this 
[04:25:30]  out to me.  It's the asshole listeners, because I've been saying but my whole life.  Look.  But it's ridiculous.  I know it's ridiculous.  I've got to say.  I've been saying finger.  This is the point I'm going to make.  Now that I hear it, it is ridiculous, and it makes me cringe.  I was listening to some old bits of ours that, I don't know, they could be like five or six  years ago.  Through the whole bit, I'm like, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  And I'm like, no one noticed this before now?  No one points it out.  No one. 
[04:26:00]  I don't have any of those verbal things, but you guys do.  Thanks, Jimmy.  You do, too.  I certainly don't.  That's the only one Anthony has, though.  You're almost perfect.  It's what I've said my whole life.  You're 99.99% perfect.  I can't be 99.99% perfect.  I must be 100%.  This is ridiculous that I should be toiling with this.  All right.  Well, finger.  Every time you say that, Steve's head just hurts.  Oh, I know.  It really does.  Your dick should be.  Bring me your finger. 
[04:26:30]  All right.  Here we go.  So here's an O and a.  You make it sound like I say it like a stroke victim.  The way you say it, it's like a collapse on the side of a mountain.  It's like, fair.  I don't go fair.  I do not say fair.  I say finger.  People never notice because their mind filled in the blank because of the context you were  saying.  Like an optical illusion?  Like you would never just run around going fair, fair, fair, fair.  What, what, what, what?  You would always say, like, yeah, I hurt my finger.  And then, ah, I'll get in. 
[04:27:00]  I don't say fair.  And their mind would just go grr.  Oh.  All right.  Anyway, here we go.  The point being, ah, these guys did a great job with, ah, putting.  Yes.  See?  I had to think before I said that.  It's a nightmare.  Ah, they took it a, they took a bit and they cleaned it up for, for regular radio, I guess.  Yeah.  So here's the original.  It's, it's quick.  Anthony, you pronounce finger weird.  You give it that soft.  You're the fucking finger guy.  I hate you, you dickbag shit fuck. 
[04:27:30]  Why?  This asshole criticizes me online about how I say finger.  I'm not a guy.  I don't even have a finger.  You're a fucking finger guy.  Dude, what's wrong with the way I, what's wrong with the way I say finger?  Finger.  Finger.  It's so much funnier now.  Okay.  Because you're yelling and trying to pronounce the word right.  I know.  You're still fucking it up.  Say it with me, Anthony.  This guy says linger.  Linger.  The word linger and finger.  Yeah.  All right.  But what about singer?  You don't say singer.  Well, the singer in a band. 
[04:28:00]  You say singer.  Singer.  Singer.  But that's how I, I say finger like I would say singer.  Right.  Not linger.  That was stupid.  Linger, finger.  Singer is actually a too hard of pronunciation.  So is finger for me.  Finger's proper though.  And so is singer.  I mean linger.  I bet you it can be pronounced both ways.  No, it can't.  No, it can't actually.  How, why?  Oh, Steve.  Yeah.  Danny Dixon is talking good.  Now the English language is all fucked up.  I don't.  The English language is one of the hardest language in the world.  Why is it, why is it, you would think it would be that easy. 
[04:28:30]  Singer then.  Why isn't it singer?  That's why when Asians try to speak like us, it's so hilarious.  Because they're trying to follow the rules.  But the rules are all over the place.  Oh, I'm a mess with this finger thing.  It just happens to little finger.  Now I've got to replay that because people forgot what the original sound like.  They did not.  I'm cursing a lot.  They sure did.  Anthony, you pronounce finger weird.  You give it that soft.  You're the fucking finger guy.  I hate you, you dickbag shit fuck.  Why?  This asshole criticizes me online about how I say finger.  I'm not the guy. 
[04:29:00]  I don't even have a...  You're a fucking finger guy.  Dude, what's wrong with the way I say finger?  All right.  Finger.  And here it is cleaned up for regular radio, I guess.  Anthony, you pronounce finger weird.  You give it that soft.  You're the fucking finger guy.  I hate you, you dime store shyster.  Why?  This egg roll criticizes me online about how I say finger.  I'm not the guy.  I don't even have a...  You're a fractured finger guy.  Dude, what's wrong with the way I say finger?  You're the fractured finger guy. 
[04:29:30]  That's pretty good.  Good job, guys.  Voice talented Travis.  Oh, yeah, Travis.  Wow.  Very good, Travis.  Travis featured in that bit.  Very nice.  There you go.  That was a short one.  Jeepers.  And, oh, this was a classic rant by Jimmy.  Yes?  I'm just hanging on until Danny runs in with some photocopied thing that pertains to it.  This is a classic rant from Jimmy.  Jimmy yelling at a caller who wanted sketches. 
[04:30:00]  Remember this?  Oh, yeah.  I very vaguely remember it.  So, you know, the original bit's just absolutely fantastic.  Fabulous.  If me, uh...  Fantagious.  Fantagious.  If, uh, Hawk was, uh, speaking right now.  Yes.  And I do believe...  Pretty cute.  A bit cute.  Is it cute?  A bit of a hawk?  You think this one's cute?  Yes, it is.  Oh, we just shift the hate around.  It's like the tides.  Why?  You ever let that slip out when you see a mother, like, undo her three-month-old son's diaper?  You ever let that just blurt out pretty cute and have to walk away quickly? 
[04:30:30]  I give, uh, Hawk credit.  He's trying to take it, but you're still having a rough time.  Oh, he's uncomfortable.  At least you're trying to, trying to, you know...  He's the king of trying to ignore.  Right.  All the time.  He'll just stare at the screen, type, like he never heard it.  Yeah, he's dissociating, like when he was five and the neighbor would put his you-know-what  and his you-know-what, and he would just pretend he was eating cotton candy.  He would just pretend he was at the zoo eating cotton candy instead of being violated by a man  with whiskey breath. 
[04:31:00]  Steve, don't encourage him.  Wow, that was really funny.  And look, he's just typing and staring at the monitor.  Type away, pretend I'm at the circus.  This isn't happening.  He's trying to be a good sport, but he doesn't take abuse well.  That's very cute.  It's hard for anyone to take abuse, that's obvious, but I think it's harder for Hawk than any of us here.  He's cute.  Unshaved with that little R-Gang hat.  Whenever I see him in a baseball hat, I just want to pull it down until his neck snaps. 
[04:31:30]  You do wear very small hats.  They're like child, they're like Vic Morrow hats.  Like a little teeny hat from like the 40s.  Can you call me Teach?  Do you throw your hats in the dryer, is that the deal?  All right, here's another bit.  Jim yelling at a caller who wanted sketches, and then we clean it up for TV.  So here's some of the original dialogue.  Aren't you supposed to be funny?  No, no, but Kenny, what I'm saying is this.  You sound like a Rube who enjoys like that mom and pop type of phony horse shit dog shit radio they have in California. 
[04:32:00]  All right.  Same line.  Yeah, a little bit.  Same line, cleaned up for regular radio.  Aren't you supposed to be funny?  No, no, but Kenny, what I'm saying is this.  You sound like a Rube who enjoys like that mom and pop type of phony hogwash dog spit radio they have in California.  Dog spit.  That's a good one.  All right.  More of the original dialogue.  Excuse me there, asshole. 
[04:32:30]  Oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  They don't say that in skits.  Wow.  What is this?  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  If you're criticizing the radio I listen to.  Well, hold on, hold on.  What's that?  Yes.  If you're criticizing the radio I listen to, it's your fucking employer.  Oh, dirty language for such a skit-loving little boy.  All right.  Excuse me there, know-it-all.  Oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  They don't say that in skits.  Wow.  What is this?  Wow. 
[04:33:00]  Wow.  Wow.  If you're criticizing the radio I listen to.  Well, hold on, hold on.  What's that?  If you're criticizing the radio I listen to, it's your foolish employer.  Oh, dirty language for such a skit-loving little boy.  What was that?  Foolish employer.  Foolish employer.  The myriad of F words you have.  We sit there and go through to try to think of the weirdest one that's going to go in place of fuck. 
[04:33:30]  Did you have to say a word with an M and a Y at the beginning?  Well, it was appropriate.  No one says myriad, ever.  That's true.  Under any circumstance.  They actually took that word out of the dictionary.  Variety.  In, uh, I think it was 1987 they actually took that out of the dictionary.  In 71 they labeled you faggot if you used it, and then in 87 they just took it out.  Myriad of reason.  Ramone, bring me a thesaurus.  Update my thesaurus.  What I'm saying is, person who I hope dies of cancer the day before a relative gets married, 
[04:34:00]  what type of a skit would you like to hear?  And you're not being specific.  You're being passive-aggressive like every other faggot from that state that you live in.  Be specific.  Oh, he got you there.  Oh, I got a cock in my mouth.  Well, it's your father.  Since your mother won't suck it, I decided to lean over and toot on it a little bit.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  All right.  How the hell are we going to clean this up for a regular radio?  It wasn't easy.  And why did I think I was slamming him by admitting I filleted his father? 
[04:34:30]  What I'm saying is, person who I hope dies of cancer the day before a relative gets married,  what type of a skit would you like to hear?  And you're not being specific.  You're being passive-aggressive like every other fruitcake from that state that you live in.  Be specific.  Cotton out of your mouth.  Oh, he got you there.  Oh, I got cotton in my mouth.  Well, it's your father, since your mother won't suck it.  I decided to lean over and try it out a little bit.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Making no sense. 
[04:35:00]  Yeah, but neither do the TV edits.  Of course they don't.  That's the point we're making here.  What's up with the wrist, huh?  What's that?  You're a guy here in San Francisco, sucking cock, you fat.  Oh, there we go.  That's the type of skit you like, isn't it?  Dirty two men talking about sucking cocks.  Now we got what you like.  Two men going back and forth.  What's up with the wrist, huh?  What's that?  You're a guy here in San Francisco, sipping coke, you freak.  Oh, there we go.  Well, that's the type of skit you like, isn't it?  Dirty two men talking about sucking corn.  Now we got what you like. 
[04:35:30]  Two men going back and forth.  Shucking corn.  Nice.  Shucking corn.  All right.  Some more original dialogue.  What do you want?  You want these faggoty sketches.  We don't do sketches, stupid.  All right.  And now cleaned up.  What do you want?  You want these fairy tale sketches.  No one, we don't do sketches, stupid.  Fairy tale.  It's very good.  It fit.  And finally, the original dialogue. 
[04:36:00]  Name me one show you listen to.  Name me one show.  That's what I'm listening to.  I've been an XM subscriber for over a year.  I don't give a shit.  Cancel the service, faggot.  Tell me something you listen to.  Don't you're not going to blackmail me.  I'm an XM subscriber.  I don't get a piece of the action, motherfucker.  What do I care?  Oh, shit.  Don't lose a customer.  I don't care if you throw your XM down the toilet, buy a Sirius, and then fuck your mother.  Holy crap.  Wow.  You were angry.  What was going on with you back then? 
[04:36:30]  I don't know.  I think I just got scared.  I lashed out.  Here's that same rant cleaned up for regular radio.  Name me one show you listen to.  Name me one show.  That's what I'm listening to.  I've been an XM subscriber for over a year.  I don't care.  Cancel the service, fella.  Tell me something you listen to.  You're not going to blackmail me.  I'm an XM subscriber.  I don't get a piece of the action.  Monkey feather.  What do I care?  Oh, sugar.  Don't lose a customer.  I don't care if you throw your XM down the toilet, buy a Sirius. 
[04:37:00]  Then hug your mother.  Hey, not bad, guys.  Very good.  Very good.  Bravo.  Thank you.  TV edit.  Martini Steve, Than, and a bit part by Travis.  Travis was a featured player in that.  Yes.  An uncredited one.  Duvall in the conversation.  In the finger bit.  There you go.  Love the finger bit. 
[04:37:30]  All I got to keep is linger in my head.  Finger longer.  I'll just think linger longer.  The Grease Man Show.  It's the worst.  The worst.  We'll be back with more of the worst of Opie and Anthony featuring Nathaniel.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Featuring Nathaniel.  It's the worst.  He's reached his potential.  This is as far as he can go.  This is it. 
[04:38:00]  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, ready for some more words of the Opie and Anthony show, Sam?  I was born ready.  Yeah, this is Sam picking my favorite bits of the old year three.  Sometimes I got to write this shit out first.  Yeah.  Because off the cuff is not my strength.  Recently, we did a little something called E-Rock-tober. 
[04:38:30]  Mm-hmm.  And we got to read some of Eric E-Rock's early writings from when he was just getting started  in radio.  This one is when he wrote a column called What the F?  Let's hear all about it.  Enjoy.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, I want to start a new segment called What the F?  I think it's kind of cool.  What the F?  Yeah, What the F?  And what will that entail? 
[04:39:00]  Just, you know, things that make you go, What the F?  What the F?  Yeah.  All right.  What the F is with orange artificial flavoring.  Huh.  It never tastes bad.  It always tastes like orange, no matter what product or company uses it.  Orange tastes like orange.  What the F?  It's true.  Yeah.  Huh.  What the F is with other artificial flavors. 
[04:39:30]  Oh.  Grape tastes like it.  Grape tastes like ass.  Hmm.  Unless it's in an ice pop where it tastes extremely sweet and sugary.  Oof.  Lime burns when you drink it.  Cherry tastes like bad cough syrup.  All the rest of artificial flavors naturally blow.  What the F?  What the F?  What?  What is this?  This is kind of like Carlin, but without any good writing or comedic timing. 
[04:40:00]  No.  Why are you making fun of my writing?  No, no disrespect.  What the F?  Not artificial flavors.  What the F?  Why do commercials on the radio or TV about people being illiterate always say the phone  number and then spell it out?  What the F?  Hello?  These people you want to call?  Hello?  Hello?  Ken Reed?  Hello?  Is it a hello?  What you're saying?  Hello?  Let's spell it.  What the F?  Wait, wait.  Hello is not actually written out.  No.  Don't tell me that there's a, like, hello? 
[04:40:30]  What the F?  Why do commercials on the radio or TV about people being illiterate always say the phone  number and then spell it out?  Hello?  These people you want to call can't read what you're saying, much less spell it.  Is this?  What the F?  Is this called what the F or hello?  It's called what the F.  Is there an earth to whoever?  Like, do they do that?  Earth to Bob.  Or how about newsflash dash?  Like, newsflash with a hyphen F. 
[04:41:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Newsflash.  Someone wants to guess the sound already.  Brooklyn Ace, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Is that E-Rock eating breakfast?  It is E-Rocktober.  Oh, no?  Oh, sorry.  By the way, did this turn into Pot Talk Monday all of a sudden?  Yeah, I know.  We're all over the place.  What the F?  We're very excited because we just discovered something that's going to really help E-Rocktober.  I don't, I, I, I'm going to say right now on October 2nd that E-Rock doesn't survive E-Rocktober. 
[04:41:30]  Yeah, it's so early and there's been so much abuse hurled his way for E-Rocktober.  We will throw a party for you, E-Rock, if you survive E-Rocktober.  I think he'll have a mental breakdown and end up running out of the studio at some point in tears.  I sincerely think that's going to happen.  That's not uncommon, though.  Eric's a sensitive boy.  He is sensitive.  Eric cries relatively easily.  He's a sweet, sensitive, emotional kid. 
[04:42:00]  E-Rock, are you enjoying the, uh, what the F bit?  Oh, thoroughly, yes.  And by the way, 80s legend from Maine, he goes, what the F is up with this dumbass segment?  Wake me up when it's over.  Zzzzz.  Zzzzz.  Did he put Z's?  I love the, or did he put the big yawn?  Sometimes with this show, you've got to wait for it.  Wait for it.  Wait for it.  If you listen to this program and you hear us doing a segment that you really think is completely out of character and lame and stupid, 
[04:42:30]  perhaps there's a reason for it.  Right.  You've got to, like, hang out for the payoff.  You can't just take everything from this show at face value.  Do you honestly think we would be doing this with the F bit?  So just, just relax.  I mean, aside from the obvious, funny, like, observational.  Oh, well, that's what I meant.  You know, it's hysterical.  It's, what, you're poking your head up over there.  What the F is with SpaghettiOs? 
[04:43:00]  What's the deal?  What's the deal with the sauce?  Three versions of SpaghettiOs?  Plain, hot dogs, and meatballs?  All three have different sauce.  You wouldn't know.  Plain's a bit on the bland side, and thin in texture.  Hot dogs is very, very, in capital letters, thin, but mildly spicy.  Meatballs is this thick, rich sauce which fills you up before you even finish the can.  Make a note of it.  What the F?  What the F? 
[04:43:30]  I hate things that are all about the subject of food.  What the F?  This should be called.  What the F?  Oh, my God.  Oh, what, what, what, what?  Oh, okay.  Oh, they've all been about some type of food.  Oh, that's why I don't have that one.  It's amazing. 
[04:44:00]  What the F is a Pokemon?  Want to catch my pocket monster?  Maybe it will Pikachu.  What the F?  Oh, hold on.  No, no, no, no.  I, I, I got, I got, I got to put my coat on.  That, it will Pikachu?  Pikachu.  Well, the pocket, oh, pocket monster and Pikachu are both characters.  See, you see, a Pokemon is a pocket monster. 
[04:44:30]  Yeah.  And Pikachu is a Pokemon.  So, pocket monster will Pikachu.  It's a play on words is what it is.  What the F?  What the F is with the video for the Christina Aguilera song, What a Girl Wants.  Notice the set?  It was taken from the 80s video for the Paula Abdul song, Cold-Hearted Snake.  What the F?  What fat girl wrote this?  Holy Jesus.  No, I don't know.  Did you, who noticed that?  What type of pudgy homo would notice that? 
[04:45:00]  Well, here's the big reveal.  In honor of E-Rocktober.  E-Rocktober, everybody.  The boys found one of E-Rock's old websites.  Yes.  Good old pseudo-radio, right, E-Rock?  Yep.  Oh, man, is he not in a good place.  Wait, when did you realize that there was something you had written?  Was it what the F or what?  Yeah, exactly when did it hit you like, oh, my God, they found this?  Um, when I went into the office to try to get water, and they were all covering up really 
[04:45:30]  fast whatever it is they had.  We had a pop-up.  Hold on.  We had a pop-up, just like a blank Google screen.  We're just looking at the internet.  Uh, you know, the internet, Googles.  We're Googling.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  E-Rock, you hanging in there for E-Rocktober?  You want to do a what the F for everybody from your old website?  People are suggesting that you should read the what the Fs, not me.  I agree.  I agree.  I agree.  Well, you have to put the mic so the audience can hear you. 
[04:46:00]  Yeah, E-Rock, we're celebrating you all month, at least talking to a microphone.  All right, so celebrate me.  You guys read it, then.  I think the boss said you should read it.  How about, uh, who wants to read the what the Fs today?  Jimmy, you want to read the what the Fs?  What the Fs?  I'd love to.  All right, this is from E-Rock's old website.  It is E-Rocktober, and he did a little segment called What the F on his website.  Pseudo radio, right?  Yeah.  Right, E-Rock?  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is funny.  What the F is with Billy Crystal's voice? 
[04:46:30]  He sounds damn close to Bert from Sesame Street.  And here's the key.  You can't, and this is why no one laughed.  Because you can't enjoy it the way I can reading it.  Because there's a single quote around Sesame Street.  Like, not quotes, but the one quote.  Right.  As opposed to just writing Sesame Street.  Yeah, why wouldn't you just?  You've got to end the what the Fs with a what the Fs.  What the F?  What the F?  You have to, like, you know, punctuate it. 
[04:47:00]  What the F?  What the F is with the double standards and age restriction.  Why can you be 18 and strip in a bar that only allows you in if you're over 21?  23 or 25 in some places!  Exclamation point.  It's the same theory as being 18 and allowed to 10 bar, yet you have to be 21 to purchase it.  It.  Also, why can you be 18 to die for your country?  Oh, no, not that, are you? 
[04:47:30]  Not this gag.  Also, why can you be 18 to die for your country in military service?  Period.  No question, Mark.  Also, why can...  Oh, yeah.  You can go to war and kill someone, but God damn it, don't let them see you drinking a Bud.  And Bud is not capitalized.  So that would imply that a Bud is your friend.  So you were apparently drinking your friend on the side and didn't want anyone to see it.  Well, yeah.  What the F? 
[04:48:00]  E-Rock's writing, these weren't for comedy.  We know that.  They certainly...  What?  These were some thoughts you had in your head, right, E-Rock?  This was part of something I did for college.  Okay, good.  Here's something you do for radio.  Read it.  What?  Yeah, read one.  Something you did for college.  E-Rock, read a What the F.  That's good in college, though.  When you ask a question, don't put a question mark.  That must have helped.  Yeah.  And start with What the F and end with What the F.  Yeah.  It is E-Rocktober.  What the F is with the English language. 
[04:48:30]  Why do we separate sentences with a punctuation mark with a name that means half-assed?  Maybe that's because most of us write...  We do...  Oh, this really sucks.  Maybe...  No, you can't say that.  Because there was a time you thought this was brilliant.  No, I wouldn't say that, but maybe that's because when most of us write, we do it that  way.  What the F?  I don't know what you mean by that.  What does that mean?  Why do we use punctuation marks? 
[04:49:00]  Yeah, half-assed semicolon.  Because...  So it's a semicolon.  Yeah.  I do hate the semicolon, by the way, so you might have a point.  I love the semicolon.  There's very few things in life I enjoy as much as the semicolon.  The semicolon is a great thing.  The semicolon separates sentences, but it's better than a comma.  Yeah.  I would never even know where to use a semicolon.  I think I overuse it, actually.  Do you?  Yes. 
[04:49:30]  Hmm.  All right.  How about another one?  What the F?  What the F is with these macho jock a-holes who call me chief or boss as a way of getting  my attention.  Since when am I appointed a head of a department or promoted to management?  No one filled...  Oh, my God.  Danny just blurted out, never.  Never.  In the background.  Oh, my God. 
[04:50:00]  All right.  Go back.  He's never going to make it to the end of the month.  I hope he's fine.  Go back there.  It's in October.  Go ahead, guy.  Go back.  From the beginning?  Yeah.  Yeah, please.  Thank you, sir.  What the F is with these macho jock a-holes who call me chief or boss as a way of getting  my attention?  Since when was I appointed head of a department or promoted to management?  No one filled me in on that one, and Lord knows my paycheck sure doesn't show it.  Just say excuse me there, sport.  What the F?  Lord knows?  Lord knows.  What do you have, a 50-year-old black woman? 
[04:50:30]  Lord knows.  Lord have mercy.  We went through some hard times.  Lord knows.  By the way, I don't think macho jocks were calling you chief or boss.  No.  It was, hey, stupid, and hey, fatso.  No, actually, they weren't even noticing him.  Just passing by in the hallway.  Poor little Iraq.  Hoping that they'd even notice.  We noticed to him.  It's just a weak rap, chief. 
[04:51:00]  You noticed him, boss.  I'm proud of the Iraq hire.  Yeah?  Yes.  It's giving us great radio.  Well, I won't doubt that.  But that said, you're not athletic.  You got one more there, Iraq.  What the F is with public restrooms?  You're in the stall, and you notice that there is a foot sliding under.  Tap, tap, tapping.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  What the F is with public restrooms? 
[04:51:30]  You're in the stall, and you notice that there is a one-foot gap from the floor to the door.  Not to mention the two-inch gap from the door's edges to the walls.  Why not just remove it all together and let everyone see what I'm doing?  Like I'm in effing prison.  It will also save you time.  Like I'm in effing prison.  I'm in prison.  I'm in prison.  What's the F? 
[04:52:00]  It will also save me the time kicking the three-year-old in the head who keeps peeking under the door to see what's going on while he's in the same booth with his dad who's taking a leak.  All right.  Wait a minute.  Three-year-olds.  It's not a three-year-old.  Are in the booth.  Who was actually peeking at Iraq?  You were the little kid in the booth, weren't you?  No, I was not.  What the F?  There was actually a three-year-old peeking from underneath.  Yeah.  Well, you probably wanted to know why there were four feet in your stall. 
[04:52:30]  Faye.  That doesn't look right.  Is there an octopus using that bathroom?  He's got two feet facing one way, two feet facing the other way, and he's making moaning noises.  He's making this sound.  I don't know.  All right.  We can finish.  Continue.  So you got the three-year-old peeking in.  That was it.  What the F?  What the F?  Did that really happen to you?  Yeah.  Can we have one more, please?  Real-life story. 
[04:53:00]  I'm hungry for this.  I know.  I can't get enough.  What the F's?  You've already been more highlighted, so.  Oh, good.  Go to the ones that aren't highlighted.  They're probably equally awful.  Someone is suggesting.  Stephen S. from Bayshore.  Hey, Ope, you guys are beating up E-Rock so badly, I think you're going to have to bring  in some Spuds Buckley audio to balance things out.  I will do this for you, E-Rock.  If you make it to the end of E-Rock-tober, I will bring in some really, really, really bad,  embarrassing stuff from my career. 
[04:53:30]  I got a CQ-102 air check.  But you're my hero.  I don't want that to happen.  And I think everyone else should bring in something embarrassing if E-Rock makes it to  the end of E-Rock-tober.  That's how we'll celebrate the last day of E-Rock-tober.  Go ahead, sweetie.  One more.  What do you think?  I agree.  Sure.  All right.  Go ahead.  One more What the F.  What the F is with collect calling.  Do rock stars usually, no, sorry, do rock stars really use 1-800-COLLECT when calling 
[04:54:00]  home?  According to the commercials, they do.  You would think they would have enough money for a payphone or a cell phone, wouldn't  you?  Or, oh, wait, I lost it.  You would think they would have enough money for a payphone, wouldn't you?  Or at least a cell phone.  Hell, those have, thanks.  Hell, those have free long distance nights and weekends.  Yourself?  What the F.  Wait, hell, those have what?  Hell!  Hell.  He's trying to be like a regular guy on paper.  You're not a regular guy. 
[04:54:30]  You have to read that end part again.  I don't want to rob you of the good point that it deserved.  Hell.  Hell, those have free long distance.  You don't know how to speak.  Hell, those don't have.  Wait, no.  Those have.  Hell.  I don't get the sentence.  He's going to be trying to say, hell, those have free long distance and Rajiji.  Give me the line, B-Rock.  Hell, those have free long distance nights and weekends. 
[04:55:00]  What the F.  Oh, okay.  We got a what the F coming in from Eric N.  What the F.  How come I get winded when I bend over to tie my shoes?  What the F.  I can't get enough, by the way, of what the F.  I love what the F.  Are there more of those anywhere?  Oh, there's pages of them.  Pages.  Yeah, we'll have more as the month goes on here.  John in Pennsylvania, what's up?  What the F makes B-Rock think he could throw off the spit? 
[04:55:30]  Andy Rooney's been trying it for years, and I never left him, so why does B-Rock think  he could do it?  What the F.  That's a good point.  B-Rock, this guy is saying you're ripping off Andy Rooney.  Well, probably.  It was for an assignment, so.  What was the assignment?  It was.  Be as abysmal on paper as possible?  Congratulations, valedictorian.  It was for a writing class where you just had to write random observations through your 
[04:56:00]  day.  Really?  Yeah.  And you decided to call it what the F, because you wanted to have a little edge to you?  Yeah.  You wanted to stand out, like, well, this kid's got on fire.  How'd you do on it, by the way?  And by the way, it's not what the F. We just have to say it that way.  He was really edgy, because he would say what the, and would say the F word.  You college kids.  But the whole word's not written out, though.  The whole word is like an asterisk in the middle of it, so he didn't write the entire word  out, so in a way, it is what the F.  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  He meant it to be like that, but he didn't write the entire word out, just in case. 
[04:56:30]  How did you do?  I passed the class.  They really didn't judge on content, obviously.  That didn't get graded or anything?  I think it was just if you did the assignment.  It was one of those 7 a.m. classes.  You went to retard school?  You got to see.  A special class?  No.  Did you get a little gold star?  Unicorn.  Gold star.  A unicorn with sparkles.  Wait, was the assignment to put it on the web?  No.  Oh.  So you were proud of them.  I just had a folder of stuff that I threw up there.  That's it.  You threw up there.  Exactly. 
[04:57:00]  Good work.  Throw it up there.  If you threw it up there.  You can't throw up anything.  You can't just throw anything up on a website.  It takes a lot of time to actually get stuff up on a website.  And this is back in the back.  It was an old website, so you could tell it was obviously written HTML, like basic HTML.  Yeah.  So you had to sit there and type out 7 pages worth of that?  Not necessarily.  That's thrown it up there.  I actually had somebody else do it.  So you hired somebody to get your writings up on the web where more people could see  it and go, wow, this What the F thing is really cool. 
[04:57:30]  Eric had a staff.  He thought he had an assignment for What the F.  Yeah.  And he thought, like, my God, this is a book waiting to happen.  You thought you'd be like the What the F guy and have all these crazy, like, you thought  it was going to be like the Gary Larson Farside phenomenon.  Like, I got the What the F calendar.  Look, September 8th.  What the F.  What the F.  One for every day of the year.  You thought you'd be like a big hit in Spencer's.  A big book with him in the back smoking a pipe. 
[04:58:00]  Exactly.  On the back cover of the book.  But it's not like a smoking pipe.  It was a crack pipe.  And he was kneeling by a gentleman to get more money for more drugs.  Can we please, look, I know we keep saying one more.  One more, Iraq.  One more What the F.  One more What the F.  My hunger.  It is Iraqtober.  We're showcasing Iraq the whole month of October.  Yeah.  For Iraqtober.  Yeah, I think Fan is helping him, which is good.  Fan would.  I liked the idea, too, about Iraqtober Fest. 
[04:58:30]  Oh, yes.  Absolutely.  I read that and thought, the longer we can make this name and the more we can do during  it, the better.  All right.  Oh, What the F.  What the F is with customers.  Why do they have to open the package to see what's inside?  It's the same thing that's on the damn label.  Why must they fill up a shopping cart and just leave it down on an aisle?  All right.  Oh, wow. 
[04:59:00]  Listen to his.  Oh, he's all.  Why must they fill up the shopping cart and just leave it down an aisle?  Put the crap back if you decided you didn't want it before I drag your ass back there and  make you do it.  What the F.  Do you, first of all.  Okay, this is an edgy tough guy here.  Do you honestly think you, if you filled up a shopping cart and for some reason had  to leave, I think there are many reasons.  Maybe you get an emergency phone call.  Maybe you realize, oh, crap, I left my wallet at home. 
[04:59:30]  Whatever the case is.  This isn't something running rampant where you're dodging full shopping carts in a supermarket.  But it does occasionally happen.  Would you empty the shopping cart?  You would go back all around all those aisles, find out where everything is and put it back?  Or would you just leave the cart there and let the guy that, you know, it's his job to  put the stuff back, let him do it?  Well, perhaps you were the guy whose job it was to put the stuff back in the aisles from  the shopping cart.  Well, what the F's with the guy that is supposed to put the stuff back, getting all peed off 
[05:00:00]  that I left the cart there.  It's his job.  What the F?  All right, good.  I was hoping you were going to end with...  Of course.  You've got to end with what the F.  Yeah, but you're a tough guy.  He is tough.  I'll drag your ass back there.  This kid's not trying to do it.  I'll drag your ass back there.  You...  Sergeant G from Iraq.  What the F?  How come Dr. Ian Smith calls me 46 times a day demanding his $600?  What the F?  What were you going to say, Iraq?  At the time when I was working at this place, there was a certain type of clientele that 
[05:00:30]  was known for doing this because they didn't have enough money.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  All right.  More what the F's on the way as we celebrate E-Rocktober.  I want this on my outgoing message.  There's nothing that makes me happier than what the F.  What the F?  It's the worst.  The worst.  We'll be back with more of the worst of Opie and Anthony featuring Nathaniel.  Lady like it. 
[05:01:00]  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The worst.  It's the worst.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  The worst.  With Nathaniel.  Holy mackerel am I enjoying that radio program.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony show featuring the pics of me, Than, a producer of the Opie  and Anthony show and also occasionally host of the Than and Sam show.  I'm joined by my host, Sam.  Hi. 
[05:01:30]  And this little, I keep saying the same thing to start all of these.  Don't worry about it.  Nobody's listening to the whole thing anyway.  That's true because the typical radio listener.  This segment is when the N-word.  Oh, my.  Was buried.  Yes.  And then the Opie and Anthony show decided to see if we could contact the N-word from beyond  the grave.  How'd it go?  You know what?  It's funny you should mention that because I have a recording of it that I'm going to 
[05:02:00]  play right now.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Big story.  So they buried the N-word and we brought in the Ouija board.  We got to see how the N-word is doing.  Let's see if we can actually contact.  I hate this Ouija board crap.  It is scary.  All right.  Dim the lights and let's see if we.  Oh, that's a creepy, creepy mood.  See if we can actually contact.  Can you really dim the lights, please, so we can maybe buy into this dumb bit?  Jesus. 
[05:02:30]  I know it's radio, but how about we dim the lights?  We do have pal talk.  Right.  See the lights haven't moved?  Contact the N-word.  You're like, what are these guys doing?  The lights aren't dimmed.  Oh, this is getting eerie now.  Look at this.  The shade's going down.  See, there you go.  We want to buy into this a little bit.  Oh, I like this.  Oh, I'm scared.  What if the N-word shows up?  Oh, my God.  Do you want creepy Ouija board music?  Okay, let's all join hands. 
[05:03:00]  Me and Jimmy are holding hands.  What are you doing, Jimmy?  Do it all day.  He said it.  He said join hands.  A little respect.  Oh, sorry.  For the dead.  Okay.  Bobby, get your hands on the Ouija board.  Oh, f*** her.  We are trying to contact you.  We hear you're dead. 
[05:03:30]  How did that happen when just the day before you seemed so vibrant in my car as I was driving  home?  Uh-oh.  Oh, it's moving.  What the hell?  The Ouija board's moving.  Oh.  What's going on?  Uh.  Jesus.  Wait, at first.  Is there somebody you want to contact?  Okay. 
[05:04:00]  See?  Oh.  Oh.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Wait, I'm losing him.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Oh, but you yelling, it scared him.  Well, thank God.  You scared him off.  Thank God it scared him off.  You scared him off.  I like this job.  But he wanted to contact someone I will never know.  I'm sure there's a cook somewhere that he wanted to talk to.  Jeez.  All right, try to bring him back. 
[05:04:30]  Bring him back.  Oh.  Oh.  F***.  Where are you?  F***.  Uh-oh.  Here it is again.  I ain't so dead.  What?  Whoa.  What?  What's that? 
[05:05:00]  You said, you know what I'm talking about, Anthony.  Come on now.  Okay.  If you are here, give us a sign.  Oh, boy.  Oh, the inappropriate bell.  That is a sign.  Wow.  This is creepy.  This is, dare I say, it's a little spooky.  It's very, yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow. 
[05:05:30]  What fell?  Wow, what happened?  Oh, crap.  Something.  Who touched that?  Nobody, right?  What was it?  I don't.  My wallet.  It's gone.  Oh, my God.  F*** is here.  F*** is with us beyond the grave.  Dude, seriously, what the F?  Things just fell.  Wow.  And no one was near.  How creepy is this?  All right, again.  What?  Who do you want to speak with?  P. 
[05:06:00]  P.  O.  P.  O.  R.  R.  C.  Wait a minute.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  What?  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, I was wondering  what porcelain doll that that, oh, we summon you to return to earth, to your earthly bounds. 
[05:06:30]  Do not leave us.  Some of us need you.  Uh-oh.  It's not moving.  It's now.  It's not moving.  We may have lost the s***.  Damn it.  Oh, jeez.  F-t-h-e-t-o-l-i-c-e. 
[05:07:00]  It's still here.  It's still here.  The s*** is still here.  Oh.  Wait.  That's odd.  Wow, wow, wow.  Every sense is filling up.  I'm...  I smell barbecue sauce.  It's like it's permeating the room.  This is amazing. 
[05:07:30]  Klaatu varata...  F***.  F***.  Earth.  Uh-oh, it's moving again.  What the hell is going on now?  Guys, I'm really scared.  I don't think we should have done this.  I just want to go back home.  What?  I'm...  in your...  house? 
[05:08:00]  Jesus.  Baby, if you can hear me, get the shotgun.  There's f*** at the house.  I see dead f***.  They're everywhere.  Oh, wow.  This is so scary. 
[05:08:30]  Hey, can we turn the lights up just a little bit, just in case?  Just in case he does appear.  Oh, I thought it was a f***, but it was just a rock scream.  Got a rock scream Tuesday.  Hey, can I ask, uh...  Can I ask, uh...  I don't have a f***.  Yeah, thank you.  Yes, you want to ask f*** a question. 
[05:09:00]  Yeah, could you ask him how Tupac continues to put out CDs, even though he's been dead for ten years?  Oh, maybe.  Excuse me.  Do you have contact with Tupac?  He...  ain't dead, mother f***.  Ooh.  I guess that's why.  It's been proven now.  Yeah.  A lot of people wondered that.  Yes. 
[05:09:30]  What...  did the N-word die of?  What did you die from?  Oh, that's terrible.  Yeah.  Overwork.  It, uh...  Seems it never had a minute off.  Oh.  Oh, I'm coming out of my trance.  Yeah, I see that.  Oh, thank you f*** for showing up today. 
[05:10:00]  Some people, uh, you know, buried you.  Others, uh, as we know, uh, think you're still alive and well.  What do you say?  Huh?  Uh-oh.  I...  I'll be there for you.  This N-word, I swear to you. 
[05:10:30]  When you get cut off in traffic, I want to be there for you.  I'll be f*** for you.  It's bond f***.  This is coming in.  N-word appears when you say its name in the mirror three times, like candy.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Let's see.  F***.  What are you doing here?  Girl, what are you doing?  Teeth.  Teeth. 
[05:11:00]  Oh, wait.  Oh, no.  What, what, what?  It's got to go.  Why?  What?  I must punch old ladies in the face till they fall over in their walker.  Oh.  Yes? 
[05:11:30]  F***.  The ghost?  Yes.  Oh.  We're going to hear from the, uh, N-word.  Yeah.  Oh.  F***.  A-boo.  F***.  A-boo.  F***.  A-boo.  All right.  Can the N-word leave, please? 
[05:12:00]  All right, N-word.  We cast you out.  Cast you out, evil N-word.  Oh, there it goes.  Oh, the lights are coming back on.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Well, the f*** is gone.  Yeah, yeah, he's, he's, he's gone.  Good.  You want to hear a joke?  No.  What you just heard was the O.P. and Anthony show making a mockery of the fact that they  had a burial for the N-word.  What you heard was a comedic dramatization. 
[05:12:30]  Of how stupid it is.  Of how silly it is to bury a mere word.  In an actual pine box with a tombstone.  And, and, and by using the context of a seance, we've shown how ridiculous it is to empower a  word to the point where you must bury it.  And how silly and useless that act actually is.  Right.  Exactly.  And, I would love to apologize to anyone that was offended.  Any dead people.  The makers of Ouija board. 
[05:13:00]  Who else?  Isn't that funny?  Like, doesn't Milton Bradley make the Ouija board?  It kind of takes something away from the ooh spirit thing.  And you see the same company that makes like Monopoly.  So you should apologize right now, speaking of Monopoly, to Baltic Avenue?  Yes.  Baltic and Mediterranean.  All right.  You know the property for...  I shall live no further down the board than St. James Place.  Yes.  It's all crap after Marvin Gardner. 
[05:13:30]  Right.  Well, you know, if you're on boardwalk, you're safe.  Yeah.  But then you're just a mere go away from...  It's the worst of O.P. and Anthony.  Hi.  I'd like to thank everybody for joining me, Than, on the worst of the O.P. and Anthony  show.  And also for my guest, Sam, to also sit in.  Sam of the Than and Sam show, as well as the O.P. and Anthony show.  That sounded genuine.  Thank you.  Bye, everybody.  I'm going to miss you.  Oh.  Slater. 
[05:14:00]  This concludes the worst of O.P. and Anthony.  Listen live from 6 a.m. to noon, Monday through Friday, with replays throughout the day.  Want more?  Go to O.P. and Anthony.com or BoundaryMusic.com.  Yay me! </pre>
