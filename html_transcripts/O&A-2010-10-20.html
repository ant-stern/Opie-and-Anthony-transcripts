<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of the Yankees' losing streak, contrasted with the Texas Rangers' success.  This segued into a bizarre anecdote about a Yankees game attendee, identified as Joe Rogan (alias Grim LaRogue), who ran onto the field professing his love for Cameron Diaz and displaying a note containing a drawing of A-Rod with a gun to his head, alongside references to Osama Bin Laden and Whitney Houston. The hosts then shifted to a discussion about sleep problems, sharing personal anecdotes and remedies.  The recent deaths of Tom Bosley and Barbara Billingsley ("Beaver's mom") were mentioned, prompting speculation and jokes about their lives.  The show moved on to the JetBlue emergency slide incident and the perceived leniency of the punishment, followed by a discussion of a Muslim cabbie slashed by a white man, highlighting perceived racial bias in the legal system's response.  The hosts discussed Jimmy McMillan, the "Rent Is Too Damn High" gubernatorial candidate, focusing on the irony of his own low rent. This led to a conversation about gentrification.  The show concluded this segment with plans for McMillan to appear in studio, alongside updates on Ian Halperin's "bed-in" and a correction regarding a misidentified music video featuring a "fat pig" (initially attributed to Tom Petty, later corrected to Loverboy).

A lengthy in-studio interview with Jimmy McMillan followed.  The segment began with a discussion about perceived feuds between radio personalities, mentioning Jay Thomas and Ira.  The hosts then analyzed a Loverboy music video, making disparaging comments about a woman deemed "fat" in the video. The majority of the segment focused on the interview with McMillan, covering his political platform, media criticisms, personal life (including past experiences as a stripper and Vietnam veteran), and his views on social issues.  McMillan shared anecdotes, often using explicit language, and engaged in humorous banter with the hosts, discussing his karate skills and past experiences as a prostitute. His niece was present in the studio. The hosts ultimately endorsed McMillan's campaign. The segment concluded with promotions for television shows and a wedding band website.

Next, a "Jocktober" segment featuring clips from "Moms in the Morning" on 98.9 Chick FM in South Carolina was aired, along with crude and sexually explicit commentary from Opie, Anthony, and producer Sam. The hosts heavily criticized the "Moms'" on-air banter and made vulgar and misogynistic remarks about their appearances and personalities. The "Moms'" segments included discussions of President Obama's appearance on Mythbusters and Barbara Billingsley's death.  The hosts frequently used offensive language, including racial slurs and homophobic remarks.  Boxing champion Bernard Hopkins then joined the show. The conversation shifted to boxing, Hopkins' upcoming fight, the physical toll of boxing, and his views on mixed martial arts and the NFL's penalties for hard hits.

Bernard Hopkins' appearance continued into the next segment, focusing on his rigorous training regimen, diet, past incarceration, and rehabilitation.  He shared views on Michael Vick's dogfighting conviction, expressing that while he couldn't condone the actions, Vick deserved redemption. Hopkins shared anecdotes from prison, attributing his life turnaround to a change in mindset and finding purpose through boxing.  The show then discussed Ian Halperin's "bed-in" protest for his book about Arnold Schwarzenegger.  A reporter, Sam, detailed his experience at the event, which involved an interview with a nearly nude Halperin.  The audio included Halperin's comments about the bed-in, his hope to attract women, and his attempt to change the US Constitution. Sam also described Halperin's assistant, Troy, who unexpectedly joined the interview.  Jimmy McMillan made a brief appearance.

A later segment detailed the bizarre details of Ian Halperin's "bed-in," including the hosts' visit to his hotel room where they found him nude in bed with another man, Troy, and a third individual, Fleas.  Troy, a guest on the show, detailed his attempts to escalate the situation.  A video of the bed-in, which inadvertently revealed the room number, was discussed.  A phone call with Amber, a woman who had been in the hotel room with Halperin, followed. The hosts engaged in sexually suggestive banter with her. Comedian Jay Moore then joined the show, and the conversation shifted to physical altercations, Jay Moore's experiences in Hollywood, and comedians' fighting abilities.  The hosts and guests used frequent profanity and engaged in sexually explicit and offensive conversations.

The final segment began with an anecdote about a man nicknamed "Chappie" and his connection to Whitey Bulger.  This led to a discussion of the FBI's most wanted list and a wanted black woman in New Jersey.  The hosts then launched into offensive jokes about various celebrities, including James Brown, Michael Jackson, and O.J. Simpson, and a digression about Akita dogs.  The hosts then showcased (or attempted to showcase) various impressions, including Chris Tucker, Al Pacino, and Harvey Keitel, peppered with further offensive jokes.  The segment concluded with more comedic banter, including a child's joke and interactions with musician Pete Correale.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:00:30]  It's astounding to me.  I didn't want to say it's racist, but God damn.  This show will rock as best as we could possibly do this radio show.  I'm going to go home and whack to a tranny later.  All right, you all right?  We just lost our demo, man.  What's wrong with you?  Is this the last draw for the rocking radio duo?  The O.P. and Anthony show.  The most popular show in the history of satellite radio.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning.  Here it is. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah, we are.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good morning.  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.  Good morning.  Sorry about your Yankees, sir.  What?  What?  I'm sorry about your Yankees, sir.  I don't keep tabs on the Yankees.  I haven't been a Yankee fan for years.  Jets fan, right?  I remember when I was a kid.  J-E-T-S.  Jets, Jets, Jets.  When I was a kid, I kind of liked the Yankees.  But, jeez, I haven't even watched the game in a long time.  Why?  What are they doing? 
[00:01:30]  Oh, you want me to tell you?  Yeah, yeah.  What happened?  Wow.  I'm all about...  Actually, I'm all about Texas.  Hey, you know what?  I have been a Texas fan, oh, my God, for fucking ever.  Hell of a ball club, Texas.  Yeah, yeah, hell of a ball club.  Those bastards are good, man.  10-3 final last night.  Fucking whipping.  Yankees down three games to one.  Hey, I changed the channel.  That first controversial home run, did they call it back?  What did they do with that call? 
[00:02:00]  They gave us one home run, and then they pulled back some later home run.  Late in the game?  Yeah, later on in the game.  Okay, the one earlier in the game.  I turned it off after that.  Yeah, yeah.  Not a big Yankees fan.  You watched the whole game?  Actually, I fell asleep.  Really?  I did.  I fell asleep.  I was sitting on the couch.  I woke up and went like, holy shit, I missed the game, but thank God I had my alarm downstairs  that wakes me up, and that is a pilsner glass of beer spilling in my lap. 
[00:02:30]  So I woke up.  Is that true?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  I woke up, and there were paper towels, and then I just said, fuck this, I'm going to  bed.  Yeah.  And then you have a lunatic running on the field last night, right?  Yes.  Yes.  He's obsessed with Cameron Diaz.  I think that was the other night.  Was that the other night?  I don't know the picture.  It was the other night.  It was just a fan.  But why are we talking about it today?  Because I'm confused.  Because it was just a fan running on the field the other night. 
[00:03:00]  Oh.  But then when they got into the details of what had happened.  Gotcha.  Then they went like, uh-oh, this guy was a little fucking more kooky than first thought.  They realized he was a lunatic.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  All right.  I thought it happened last night.  They thought he was just a fan that ran on the field.  But it turns out he is a Cameron Diaz fan.  Ho, ho.  Was she at the game?  Well, I'm not sure if she was at the game, but A-Rod, who was pumping her, was at the  game, indeed. 
[00:03:30]  And he ran onto the field because he wanted to have a little chat with A-Rod.  Oh, that's normal.  Yeah, yeah.  And they found some type of note in his pocket with a little drawing of A-Rod with a gun to  his head saying, you're out of here, something like that.  And he's professing his love for Cameron Diaz and said that he has fouled enough of our white  princesses. 
[00:04:00]  No.  God makes a good point.  Being a huge Kate Hudson fan, I think the guy makes a good point.  You know, you got to.  You got to draw the line somewhere, don't you?  What a lunatic.  Didn't he have an Osama Bin Laden picture, too?  Well, who doesn't?  Come on.  Don't we all carry a wallet?  Hey, Travis.  What's up, sir?  He had a picture of Bin Laden calling him his master.  Master.  Master.  Master.  He also had a picture of Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown. 
[00:04:30]  Why?  That's a weird combination.  Because apparently he says that Whitney Houston will be his master's wife.  He wants Whitney Houston?  Yeah.  No, no, no.  He wants, no.  Whitney Houston, he wrote on Whitney Houston's picture, Whitney Bin Laden.  Oh, so Whitney's going to hook up with Osama Bin Laden.  Oh, nice.  Is this guy, was this guy Ian Halperin with his celebrity predictions?  Hey, slow down with Ian Halperin.  We got an update on him.  Oh, great.  And it's very impressive. 
[00:05:00]  What do you do with a guy like this who thinks that Bin Laden and Whitney Houston, even  Bin Laden's money couldn't save her singing career?  You know what, though?  Although, in contrast with Bobby Brown, he doesn't look all that bad.  It is a healthier relationship.  Yeah.  It's not a bad idea.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Whitney Houston involved with Osama Bin Laden.  Maybe she goes back to some of that crack.  Yeah.  That weakens Obama a little bit.  He does something stupid and we catch him.  Sure.  So I think this guy's a smart one.  And he also wrote a 700-page book about ninjas.  Wow. 
[00:05:30]  Holy shit.  Would you ever read that?  Oof.  How many pages do you think he could get through?  Two.  Two, right?  His name is Grim LaRogue, but it's not what his real name is.  No, his real name, oddly enough, is?  Joe Rogan.  His name is literally Joe Rogan.  He changed it from Joe Rogan to Grim LaRogue.  Yeah.  What is Grim LaRogue?  I'm Grim LaRogue.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  A rogue.  Where does that come from?  A rogue in French is some kind of a charlatan.  Yeah, we know that.  Some kind of a thing.  So LaRogue, the rogue. 
[00:06:00]  Grim LaRogue.  And then he's Grim, which is, you know, Grim.  I would just stick to Joe Rogan.  That kicks ass.  Yeah, that's a great name.  What's your name?  Joe Rogan.  I ain't fucking with this guy.  Joe Rogan's a strong name.  Yes.  Grim LaRogue.  I am Grim LaRogue.  That's a little rough.  He had guns, too.  Not on him at the stadium, but guns at home, right?  Really?  Did he?  He drew a picture on the paper of it.  Oh, he just drew a picture of a gun.  I thought he actually had guns.  Oh, this guy seems a little kooky. 
[00:06:30]  You think?  Like the Bin Laden Whitney fucking connection?  That'd be hard to get.  You know what?  Knowing our judicial system, they'll give him a weekend in jail.  That's fine.  And then he'll be cured, and everyone will be fine.  Everyone will laugh at his shenanigans, and then they'll let him out.  Yeah, because as crazy as he is, all he did was trespass.  That's all he's got.  Yeah, so maybe he gets a weekend in jail.  There could be some kind of a menacing, because of his threatening little letter, and what  his intent might have been, but again, it's just trespassing. 
[00:07:00]  They'll plea it down to nothing, and he'll be out.  At least a book, Rupert Pupkin, make me famous.  We need a new Rupert Pupkin, so that's not a bad idea.  Get them all every day, I think.  This guy's got some good ideas.  Kenny, I gotta have a Pop-Tart.  I can't smell these things without eating them.  What?  They're fantastic.  This place smells like perfume.  It's like a room full of pussy without the stink or crankiness.  It's fantastic, because now I'm surrounded.  Opie has a wonderful, what is that, cinnamon? 
[00:07:30]  Brown sugar cinnamon.  What do you mean, what is it?  Brown sugar cinnamon.  It's the only Pop-Tart you should be eating, the brown sugar cinnamon.  Jimmy just got one, and they're heated, so the smell is just wafting.  It is fantastic.  You got blueberry or...  No, I had to eat the brown sugar.  Yeah, brown sugar's the only way to go, and you don't need the frosting on top.  No, you certainly don't.  I prefer it.  You like the frosting on top?  Oh, come on.  Yeah, I guess if you have to, but you know, when you're trying to watch, you want to watch.  I need one, Kenny.  Pronto. 
[00:08:00]  He ran away.  Pop-Tart.  It's amazing, the Pop-Tart, by the way.  Yeah.  I didn't sleep, I stayed awake all night on purpose.  Yeah.  Just with my eyes open in bed.  Why?  I don't know.  My girlfriend was tossing and turning.  It's like she was dreaming of being raped by dogs.  An improvement?  Yeah.  Over the sex she had to tolerate.  To tolerate?  I don't think a girl has to tolerate sex with you.  Oh, Jimmy.  I just laid in bed.  And you couldn't sleep?  No, I tried. 
[00:08:30]  Nothing helped.  Well, you know what?  Trying to sleep is the worst thing you could do.  As soon as you get in your head, you can't sleep.  You're done.  You need some kind of distraction.  That's when you have to get up out of bed and walk around for 15 minutes.  You know what works sometimes?  I'm serious.  That's what works.  No, no, no.  I just told you what works.  I don't like that because that gets your blood pumping again.  No, it fucks up the cycle.  Really?  You get into some weird fucking sleep cycle.  So you get up and you do anything.  Check your email.  I'm telling you.  Yeah?  I've had sleep problems for the last, I don't know how many years. 
[00:09:00]  And it helps.  You know what you do?  Drink a little milk maybe.  Go to the fridge and fucking drink some milk or something.  No.  Just a little couple sips.  My God.  Why not build a house while you're at it?  You have to get.  Oh, my goodness.  I'll get experts on the phone.  I'm telling you.  You have to get out of bed.  It sounds crazy.  That's crazy.  For like 15 minutes and then like your brain resets for sleep.  But then in that 15 minutes you may have fallen asleep.  Got to keep the lights a little dim though.  Yeah, yeah.  Lights dim.  You don't want too much stimulation.  There may be a little email checking.  You don't turn your lights all the way on and play the tuba? 
[00:09:30]  That would make it worse.  For 15 minutes.  What do you do?  Because that's, I'm serious.  I've had to talk to experts and that's the thing we talked about.  If I have trouble sleeping, I will turn away from the TV because, again, I need the TV on.  And if I turn it off, I will have problems sleeping.  Right.  Yeah.  But I turn away from it.  So it's just a little flickering light.  No volume or anything.  I just like that little flickery light.  I shut my eyes.  And then I actually say, like, but barely saying it.  Almost like a ventriloquist. 
[00:10:00]  You've got to go like, with your breath.  You breathe in.  You go, sleep.  Relax.  Sleep.  And before you know it, you're just fucking asleep.  I like to fucking bang cymbals by your head while you're doing that.  Are you scared of the dark?  Nah, I'm not scared of the dark.  He's scared of his own thoughts.  We've gone over this.  I just don't like, um...  He doesn't want to be alone in his own head.  No, I like being able to, if I do wake up, I like being able to, like, open an eye and 
[00:10:30]  go, oh, look how its meat is on.  They're making wooden bowls.  And then I just kind of, I'm back asleep again.  I'm constantly getting more knowledge, even as I sleep.  I'm amazing.  You think you're just soaking in knowledge?  Yes.  Of course.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I just, it's one of those things, I've gone to sleep with the TV on forever, my entire  life.  And it's one of those things I can't stop.  And I figure, I don't want to stop it.  Why would I, why would I fucking stop it?  My fucking chick was just tossing and turning. 
[00:11:00]  Kicking and...  Every, every time, I did fall asleep at one point, and all of a sudden, jerk!  She's just jerking like something.  What did she yell your name?  But it's like, what are you doing?  Yeah.  In your sleep.  What is she doing?  She had no excuse for it.  She thinks she might have been warm.  Because, um, in my building, you can only get AC.  The, once the heat goes on, you can't get AC.  Oh my God.  Drives me nuts.  I'm gonna move. 
[00:11:30]  I can't imagine that.  I'm gonna move.  My room, year round, 67 degrees.  I like your call.  Winter, summer, 67 degrees.  Open the window.  Yeah, Jimmy brings up something that happens here in Manhattan.  I mean, you can't turn off the AC in these buildings.  I use AC in the middle of winter, because the heat rises, and you're baking in your fucking  apartment.  I lived in Brooklyn, I know what you mean.  And then if you open the windows, you hear the traffic.  Yeah.  And that, if I have traffic, I can't fucking sleep.  You guys probably hear the air traffic. 
[00:12:00]  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, I'm a little high up.  You guys are high up in the cosmos.  I'm only on the 10th floor.  Oh, okay.  I'm only on 40.  Yeah.  40 something.  40 something.  That's pretty high.  And you still hear meh, meh, meh, meh, meh.  I'll say 40.  You hear traffic?  Huh?  Oh, yeah.  You still hear traffic?  West Side Highway.  Forget it.  I don't know.  A constant buzz of traffic.  Yeah.  That high up.  I think the humming would be nice.  You would like it.  I need complete silence.  Wow.  But so he doesn't have AC.  They turn off the AC in his building for the rest of the year.  That's insane.  It makes me, after the building.  That doesn't make sense. 
[00:12:30]  How many people are complaining?  Jeez, that doesn't make sense.  I don't know, but it's the way the building, somebody who's a duct guy would know the system  it is.  That would be me.  It's a one kind of system or another kind of system.  Your building probably has a two thing system where mine is one.  Makes me nuts.  I can't turn my ear on.  Now, if you, what happens is you get a heater, like the furnace turns on and you turn that 
[00:13:00]  on by opening like probably a zone damper for your apartment.  Now, the whole apartment's getting heat from the furnace.  You don't have a separate furnace in your apartment, right?  Right.  Yeah.  So, if they have AC and heat at the same time, they would need two separate duct systems  or else you're sending heat and AC up the same duct.  Yeah, we have one.  It doesn't work.  One.  So, you have one system.  I hate it.  So, if the guy upstairs is hot, he'll turn on his heat and it's all heat going through 
[00:13:30]  the duct, you're only going to get heat.  It makes me so angry that I own a place and I can't fucking get the temperature I want.  I'm going to move down to one of the other buildings they're working on.  I can't do it.  And it's just dry heat.  It's that bad heat.  Oh, it blows, dude.  It fucking blows.  You feel like you're suffocating.  It's the worst type of heat.  I have that in Brooklyn where they would shut your...  And they send you a little memo.  It goes, hey, the air conditioning will be shut off at this time and the heat will be turned on.  And I'm like, no.  I like air conditioning. 
[00:14:00]  Year round.  It conditions the air.  My old building, I could do that.  It's fucking where I lived on 43rd Street, man.  It would be freezing in my room.  I love a cold room.  Cold room.  Lots of blankets.  Mmm.  Then again, it doesn't matter.  I didn't sleep then either.  And now you just have a sleepy problem?  Yeah.  Every time I would try to fall asleep, I would just think about Tom Bosley being dead.  I know.  And I would just be happy. 
[00:14:30]  I almost said very sad.  Why is it sad?  I don't know the guy.  Because we all grew up with him.  It was part of our childhood, I guess.  As our almost a surrogate father's figure on happy days.  You've got to start believing in God.  Hey, Mr. C.  Now it's Mr. Corpse.  Yeah.  Mr. Cadaver.  You've got to start believing in God, though, because the coincidences are strange.  Yeah?  What happened?  You lose a TV mom and then you lose a TV dad? 
[00:15:00]  What the fuck?  And, like, definitive TV mom and TV dad.  They've been living their lives, like, not bumping into each other, probably.  And all of a sudden, they're connected in this way, in death.  They take out the mom, now they take out the TV dad?  That's crazy.  I guess God's making a sitcom.  He might be.  He just might be.  Isn't that...  Whoa!  He looked all right.  He was 83.  Yeah, you know, but you remember him.  He had a great life.  Just to see.  How do you know?  Yeah, exactly.  Maybe he was tortured by homosexual thoughts. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  I can imagine.  I heard he would always get thrown in a Henry Winkler's dressing room for putting his socks  on his face while he masturbated.  He'd be on his back with Fonzie socks on his face, jerking off onto a glad bag.  Did that happen?  I can't wait for the tell-all book.  You think he made a pact with Fonzie to clean out his apartment in case he died?  Like, if you hear about my death, get over to my place immediately and get rid of the  boxers.  Yeah.  You know what I'm talking about. 
[00:16:00]  That's what the cowboy had.  What was he, a cowboy?  I guess he was doing some kind of fucking promotion there.  Or is he a lawyer?  Jerry Spence.  Yeah.  We'll take care of the government.  You have enough to worry about.  So if God takes out a big-time TV kid, are you going to start believing in God?  Yeah, if...  You got the mom, you got the dad.  Yeah, if, like, Ralph Mouth died?  Nah, it's got to be bigger than that.  Yeah?  Ralph Mouth.  Potsy?  Bigger.  So I don't want to go with...  No, don't say that. 
[00:16:30]  No, no, no.  It's got to be like a...  It's got to be a has-been, right?  Yeah, but someone that was just massively huge as a kid on a sitcom.  Joey Lawrence?  Joey Lawrence.  Bye-bye, Joey Lawrence.  Whoa.  That's what he's going to say when he almost gets into a car wreck.  Whoa.  Yeah, so we lost Tom Bosley overnight.  83 years old.  Yeah.  Mr. C is dead.  Oh.  Beaver's mom is dead. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, yeah.  Thank you, Kevin, from Connecticut.  And Fish still walks the earth, baby.  Fucking Fish.  Amazing lifespan on Fish.  God, how old is Abe Vigoda?  How old is he, you think?  He was old on Fish.  86, I'm going to guess.  He's only a few years older than Mr. Bosley.  I'm guessing.  That's a total guess.  92.  I'm going 88.  Okay.  45.  He was born in 1977.  Fuck.  Was he?  No.  Of course not. 
[00:17:30]  89.  Wow.  He's 89 years old.  89 years old.  Fish still walks the earth.  God bless him.  He was old in the godfather.  He was...  I know.  He was born old.  Find a young picture of Abe Vigoda.  I bet you can't do it.  Young Abe Vigoda.  Is it possible?  I bet he was quite the fucking goer.  I think we all have, like, a friend or a family member that they were just born old.  Burying his big schnoz in some young fucking 1930s pussy.  All right.  Here's a black and white photo of Abe Vigoda.  He looked old there. 
[00:18:00]  Wow.  And I bet she's 30...  I guess 35 or something.  Oh, my God.  He was a weird looking fuck then.  Yeah.  That's Abe Vigoda?  Yeah.  He looks like Nicolas Cage.  Is that from a...  Yeah, it kind of does.  Is that from a Twilight Zone or something?  They all were in Twilight Zone.  Wow.  He was old in a Twilight Zone.  You're right.  They were...  Everyone...  That was the thing to do back then.  That was like the fucking...  What's the big...  Something Law?  The liberal show?  Yeah, like...  Something Law.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What is that show? 
[00:18:30]  Law and Order?  Yes, that's it.  Yeah, to do those guest spots.  Twilight Zone was like that, yeah.  They would do that.  They had a bunch of these, like, TV theater things.  It's that a lot of the celebrities would do...  Now, people are saying we already got the kid, Gary Coleman.  Gary Coleman.  So, within the year, we got the whole family.  We got the TV mom, the TV dad, and the TV kid.  How long ago was Gary Coleman already?  That's a while now, no?  Yeah.  Four months, maybe?  No, now we need some co-stars.  Yeah, but man...  Need a wacky neighbor.  But when you do that award show, it's going to look perfect. 
[00:19:00]  You show the, you know, Mrs. Beaver, you show...  Mrs. Beaver.  I love that Mrs. Beaver.  You show Mr. Cunningham, and then you show freaking Gary Coleman.  Oh, dead boner.  Boner's dead.  Remember that.  Boner's dead.  Motherfucker!  Yep.  No one remembers boner.  No.  We remember.  We continue to carry the torch for the boner.  I didn't remember.  Someone wrote it.  Poor boner.  Stupid boner.  Uh...  Damn. 
[00:19:30]  So...  Yeah, Tom Bosley.  Hey, you know the, um...  Good night, funny man.  You know the JetBlue guy?  Yeah, the guy that had a problem, opened up the emergency slide.  You know, we all loved him for, what, a day, and then we realized what an asshole the guy  really is.  Yeah.  Right?  Didn't we all kind of turn on him quickly?  Yeah, that's what happened.  He was, uh...  He did...  Like, oh, what a rebel.  Look what he's doing.  And then it's like, wow, this guy's a dick.  Yeah, he went from doing something that a lot of people wish they could do, and then  you realize, what a fucking asshole. 
[00:20:00]  That's a dick.  You know, he only got, like, a $10,000 fine he's done already.  Probably a big chunk out of his savings.  Yeah, but you gotta make an example.  A little jail time?  A little hard time?  Uh, he agrees to pay $10,000 to avoid jail.  So, basically, the core system is telling the world, guess what?  You could slide down the little chute, if you like.  It'll cost you 10 Gs.  If you got the 10 Gs.  For the ride?  That would be kind of fun.  Yeah, but there's thrill seekers out there that have a nice bank account. 
[00:20:30]  Why wouldn't you do this for $10,000 if you know you could get away with it?  Why not?  Why not?  Why not?  You gotta think, you gotta give him some kind of sentence, something.  Even, even like a month in jail, just so his freedom is taken away.  Or have him pick up garbage on the side of the road for, uh, eight years.  Well, that's good.  Eight years?  But he only, uh, has to pay a $10,000 fine. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, a $10,000 fine.  And, of course, the newspaper, because they gotta be cute.  Or, about $5,000 for each beer he grabbed before hopping down the plane's emergency chute.  Ah, well.  That means he had, what, three beers?  Um, two.  Yeah.  So, that's happened today.  And then, remember the, uh, remember the cabbie that, uh, that got slashed by the white kid?  Yeah.  The Muslim cabbie.  Yep.  Got his, uh, throat slit by, uh, some young white gentlemen. 
[00:21:30]  And the guy was bleeding out.  He's lucky to be alive, the cabbie.  That guy's out of jail on bail.  Yeah, he made bail.  What the fuck?  Like, um, half a mil.  Half a million dollar bail.  You know, that's easy nowadays, because a lot of these, you know, they do the, they put their house up.  They put their house up, is what they did.  They had to come up with, like, a couple hundred thousand cash, and then they put their house up.  Oh, they had to come up with a couple hundred thousand.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, that's rough, obviously.  But, uh, Jesus. 
[00:22:00]  The guy's out.  He's got a curfew, and he's got to wear one of those, like, anklet things.  Oh, good for him.  He's out.  I don't think he's allowed to take cabs.  How is that possible, though, man?  You slashed an innocent cabbie right across the fucking throat.  Um, let me, uh, answer that for all the black people out there, because he's white.  You think?  Yeah.  Do you think, you think if it was a black guy, there's no fucking way?  Black guy, this would be, this, if he was a black guy, uh, and he slashed the throat of, like, a white cab driver, he would be in the lowest bowels of Rikers Island. 
[00:22:30]  They would lose him.  They would totally lose him.  They'd lose some of these guys, you know.  It would look like that, that, uh, insane sanitarium place that, um, was in, uh, Midnight Express.  Oh, shit.  Just the lowest part of the prison.  They would just lose him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, I guess, uh, if they had a house and, uh, his, uh, his parents had a house to put up and some cash, yeah, he probably wasn't, uh, from a broke family, so.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  So, that's what's going on.  Racism.  There was some, oh, oh.  The bail is too damn high.  Well, the, the too damn high guy.  Good segue, Anthony.  We had him on the phone yesterday.  The press didn't pick up on our exclusive interview with the, uh, rent is too damn high guy.  Why?  And, uh, he's obviously one of the candidates for the, uh, governorship of New York State.  And, uh, man, he made a mark.  Everyone's talking about Jimmy McMillan.  Mm-hmm.  And he was screaming all, all night long, you know, his rent is too damn high or rent is too damn high. 
[00:23:30]  Rent is too damn high.  And that's the party name and everything?  Yeah.  Well, someone decided to do a little digging and, uh, good old Jimmy McMillan.  Oh, digging.  Digging.  Good old Jimmy McMillan, uh, only pays $800 a month rent.  And he lives in New York City, well, in one of the boroughs, Brooklyn.  So, of course, the paper has to say, rent too damn low.  Rent too damn low.  But now, if you read a little more into the story, the guy lives in Flatbush.  Is Flatbush still bad? 
[00:24:00]  Oh, yes.  Parts of Harlem, you can't say are bad anymore.  They have not fixed up.  Is Flatbush still really bad?  No, they haven't really delved into Brooklyn except for Dumbo.  They've given up on Flatbush?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Flatbush, uh, is the, if you're driving through Flatbush, lights are optional for white people.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Well, look at this, though.  I mean, his rent hasn't increased in five years.  Five years.  Listen to this.  One bedroom.  Yeah.  Eight hundred dollars.  Eight hundred bucks.  And I don't think he's got anything with that. 
[00:24:30]  It's probably nothing good, you know?  He probably has a little turlet, and he probably has a tiny little maybe kitchen area.  He probably lives in a shithole.  Why are they making it sound like he's got this fucking Upper West Side penthouse apartment  for eight hundred dollars a month?  He lives in Flatbush.  That's not, that's too damn high.  Too damn high.  But, of course, they have to spin it the other way.  That's a little too low.  But it's Flatbush.  It's a one-bedroom.  Should we get him on the phone?  He's our guy, man.  We should have him on a lot.  Our guy. 
[00:25:00]  Can we try to get Jimmy McMillan?  McMillan, he's going to defend this.  I guarantee it.  Oh, he'll defend it with some lunacy.  The rents should go up, but they haven't.  People don't have that kind of money.  See?  See, they want to raise the rent, but they realize they can't get any more money out of  these people.  Right.  So it would displace those people, and new people would have to move in that can afford it.  Right.  And no one's going to do that if it's Flatbush, and they're not doing anything to improve  the neighborhood.  Isn't that a way to improve the neighborhood, though? 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  Like, if you get the riffraff out, and you raise the rent...  I don't know how that happens.  That's how they did it in Harlem, by the way.  You just mentioned Harlem is a much better place.  The rents in Harlem have gone up because the place is better now.  I understand that, but it has to start somewhere.  So who's the guy brave enough to go, yeah, I'm moving into Flatbush because I just found  an apartment for $1,000 that used to be $800, and I like the place.  You've got to raise all the rents to get the people out first.  At one time?  Yeah.  And then people start moving in. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, but then people are going to move into shitholes before the neighborhood is nice.  Like, how does that work?  You've got to put them in concentration camps.  Concentration camps for a while?  Everyone that's paying the low rent goes into the Midwest concentration camp.  You've got to build a Magic Johnson movie theater.  You've got to start there.  Yeah?  Magic Johnson movie theater in Flatbush.  It's like a magnet?  Well, that's the start.  And then everyone else realizes, oh, wait a minute.  Okay, this neighborhood is on the up and up.  And then you start building some other things in the area, and then you move the people out.  Oh. 
[00:26:30]  I don't know how it...  I would love to know how that works.  It's got to be an extremely slow process.  Yeah, yeah.  You can't just raise the rent in Harlem and have people moving in, you know, moving trucks all over the place.  That's true.  I mean, you know, people are scared.  Yeah.  Of bad neighborhoods.  So how does it all of a sudden become a good neighborhood?  I don't know.  I lived in Brooklyn, and I saw some areas that...  All right.  There was a mall there.  Is that Kings County Mall?  Oh, shit, yeah. 
[00:27:00]  Believe me, it gets a new name by white people.  Sure.  Kings County Mall gets a new name.  I'm just going to say, you know, the county part gets changed.  But go back...  And the S gets taken off of Kings.  Go back in time.  We got it.  I got it a long time ago.  We got it a long time ago.  Yes.  But go back in time when maybe you started making a little more money.  Why would you move into a bad neighborhood? 
[00:27:30]  To get back to the community, Opie.  To get back.  I did that.  I moved back to Long Island to give back.  How does it work?  Who's the brave souls?  You got to get some liberal white kids.  Does it start with the liberal white kids?  Liberal white kids.  Like, look at what they did with Dumbo.  With Dumbo.  That's part of Brooklyn that they want to make all fancy schmancy.  They did that.  They started building some quality condos and shit.  Right.  And got these young hipsters to move in so they could say they live in Dumbo, man. 
[00:28:00]  And then it pushes the riffraff further away.  I still get all that.  But then you got to get the guy who's building all the nice new buildings to commit to building  his stuff in a bad neighborhood.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's the gamble.  But if it pays off, you win.  This guy, you think he had to pay a lot of money to say, I'm going to build a shithole of  fucking Brooklyn?  And then you give it a name like Dumbo and you fucking, you know, all the hipsters move  in.  And now you're sitting there going, holy shit, this cost me nothing.  Yeah.  And I'm making a fortune now.  The meatpacking district.  Meatpacking was the same thing. 
[00:28:30]  That was a shithole.  I was like, fuck, man.  Or the shithole.  Now it's the place to be.  But all of a sudden it becomes the place to be.  I just don't get it.  I'm sure.  Because it has to start somewhere.  Yes, Travis.  It can backfire, too.  There's luxury apartment buildings in Bushwick that nobody bought or rented.  And now they serve as homeless shelters.  Yeah.  Luxury apartment buildings are homeless shelters.  Well, you got to also look at your neighborhood.  Bushwick is not a good choice for somewhere that you want to build luxury. 
[00:29:00]  Apartments and hope it cleans up the neighborhood.  Does it have to be kind of connected to a nice neighborhood?  Yeah, you can't go.  And then you got to slowly spread it.  You can't drop your condos in miles behind enemy lines.  Right, right, right.  You got to start in the rear echelon and kind of, you know, push up.  A little gentrification.  Uh-huh.  Because Patrice bought in an area that was supposed to be on the up and up.  And he got fucked, too.  He was just talking about that on our show.  Wow.  What happened?  His area had never, never developed.  The places that pay off are a lot more slim than the places that don't pay off. 
[00:29:30]  So I guess it's a gamble.  I guess it comes down to a gamble.  It's a gamble.  You got to be a little lucky, too.  To find some backers.  We have a former producer may have bought or rented into a luxury apartment building in  a not-so-good neighborhood.  Did I?  No, not him.  Oh, okay.  No.  Oh, okay.  I gotcha.  Wow, and it turned into, like, well, I mean, he lives in a really nice building in a not-so-great 
[00:30:00]  area, and I just don't understand the appeal to that.  Who is it?  Fan.  Oh, fan.  Yeah.  Where is his built?  Where is his, uh...  He is in East New York.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  It's a one luxury apartment.  Set up like a friggin', uh, whatever.  I don't even know how.  Something highly secure.  There's so many new names for these, like, neighborhoods in Brooklyn, I don't even know  where you would say he lives.  What it used to be, yeah.  It's near downtown Brooklyn.  Yeah, yeah.  So it's still a bad area.  Yeah.  I mean...  Not moving forward. 
[00:30:30]  It's one of those subway stops where you know who's getting on and getting off.  Wait, where is it now?  In Manhattan?  No, it's in Brooklyn.  It's by the Brooklyn Art Museum.  Bam.  Is it by the Bam?  Is it a nice building?  Yeah, it's a very nice building.  But it's just...  I wouldn't want to live in that neighborhood.  What's he doing?  But as soon as you leave the building, it's shit.  Oh, my God.  And I wouldn't...  It's like Omega Man.  Does he live like Omega Man?  He's got to go upstairs and lock up.  I just wouldn't want to be seen walking into that building, you know?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:31:00]  In that neighborhood.  How do you get anything delivered?  Yeah.  Ooh, that's scary.  Did we try to get Jimmy McMillan on our show?  Because he's going to be on iMis this morning.  Fuck.  Oh, iMis.  Do we have a cell number for him?  Yeah, well, I gave it to...  All right, let's try to get Jimmy McMillan.  He's our guy, man.  We can't be sharing him with other radio shows.  Oh, is that it?  Like Ira, we've got to just keep him to us.  Right, Jay Thomas?  Can't share people, right?  Even though he's running for a public office and wants as much exposure as possible.  We're trying to get him on the phone right now. 
[00:31:30]  We'll see what happens, but...  What the fuck are you saying?  How old am you?  Is he going in or is he...  I would assume he's going in.  I don't know how he's affording...  Oh, is he?  ...the big trip to Manhattan, but he's coming in.  Oh, well, we're moving on up.  Right, right, right on.  Yeah, Imus sounded a little different last time we played his audio. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, I was...  Maybe he had a clue.  Some of these guys, but running for office and saying,  I'm in the morning program, 7.05, I'm in the morning.  We're going to have Jimmy McMillan come on there.  He's going to talk about his Bretton Tuna High party.  Oh, shut up.  I assure you it's Imus, please.  Even though I don't sound like I've had my nose cut off.  I'm eating off my chimpanzee or something.  Oh, I, man. 
[00:32:30]  Blow your nose, Imus.  Maybe he was a little sick last time we...  Yeah, it probably is.  I'm sure if we listened to him today, he'd sound fine.  But fuck Jimmy McMillan, $800 a month.  That's too damn high for that area.  Two!  Damn high!  Upper West Side or something, he's getting a bargain.  Rent control is always hilarious.  Yeah, rent control.  Every once in a while, they'll run a story in, I don't know, one of the papers  about some old lady.  She's now 90, and she's still paying like $25 a month for an amazing apartment  in an amazing neighborhood.  There's 500 people waiting for her to drop dead so they could get in there. 
[00:33:00]  The landlord is setting up booby traps every day.  Oh, he hates the idea.  He leaves the building.  It goes to show you again what we've talked about.  It's hilarious.  You really don't have freedom to do anything.  Of course not.  It's your place, you own it?  Yeah, no, you can't rent it out for that much.  Why?  We said so.  There was a story a couple weeks ago about some old guy who's pretty much dead.  Like, he's deaf.  He can't move around.  But he's paying like $50 a month in New York.  Oh my God. 
[00:33:30]  When I said $25, I wasn't trying to exaggerate to make the joke better.  It's unbelievable, some of these people.  They're praying that he doesn't have family because then he can pass it down to them.  Oh.  And there's nothing you can do about it.  Wait, so you can keep it in the family?  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  I don't know about that.  Yes, you can.  What's the family?  Any family or immediate?  Immediate family.  Okay.  Immediate family.  I think the government got involved to stop that because there's more money to be made  if you've got a million dollar apartment.  If you are a immediate family, you have to pay some kind of estate tax based on what the  true value would be of the bloody, bloody, bloody, so they can make a shitload of fucking 
[00:34:00]  money.  And then there was that old woman who lived in the Carnegie Hall building.  I heard she had a bunch of kids.  She don't know what the fuck to do.  Thank you very much.  It's Green Beer.  For your information.  I used to like the shoe people.  Did you?  I knew what to do.  I bet you did, Uncle Paul.  Yeah.  Had so many children.  Her uterus fell out. 
[00:34:30]  It's one of the dice.  One of my favorites from the time, the dice man.  What was that?  What old lady at Carnegie?  Yeah, what happened?  Yeah, what did she do?  The Carnegie Hall building and they were trying to kick everybody out and she refused to leave  and there's almost nothing that they can do about it.  Is she still there?  I think so, yeah.  Oh, because she pays low rent?  Yeah.  And they want to turn the entire building into a, you know, luxury condo.  I wonder how many people get killed from that.  Like, how many hit men are hired to just wipe out the old lady.  They put the pillow over her face and they're like, oh, it was tragic.  She had a heart attack or something. 
[00:35:00]  You got to think there's a few that went down that way.  Yeah.  My other favorite is the guy that wouldn't sell to the city or whatever and they have  to build massive buildings around their shitty house.  They build their house or their building and they put like half the building on stilts.  Right.  Yeah.  I love when you see those stories in the paper.  There was a guy who held out in Brooklyn because they're trying to build that new place.  He's the one guy who held out.  He was the last guy in the building.  You know how creepy that's got to be?  Yes.  And they did everything.  They were turning off his heat. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, yeah.  He was having electric problems, all that crap, and he refused to fucking move.  I forgot about that.  He was pretty much a squatter in this building.  They didn't know what to do with the guy.  He got millions of them, right?  Oh, yeah.  He held out a lot better than everyone else.  He sure did.  Was he a scumbag, though?  Or was he like some...  I can't decide whether these people are like, hey, look, it's my place.  I don't want to leave and fuck you.  And where's the line where they're just being unreasonable scumbags?  I don't think you're being a scumbag at all.  If you own a house and the city's trying to take it away to build some huge arena? 
[00:36:00]  No, no.  But I mean, if you live in an apartment...  The difference is like...  Say you live in a building in New York.  Oh, if you own an apartment.  Or an apartment in New York, which is a little different than property, say, in Westchester.  And they're offering you a lot more than it's worth.  I don't know what the motives are.  If a guy's motives are because I love my place, I don't want to leave, that's one thing.  Well, it's their home, Jimmy, you know?  But how many people's motives are just to be dicks?  Well, then there's a little something called eminent domain that they pull, which is...  This, to me, sounds completely illegal, unconstitutional. 
[00:36:30]  I'm amazed it even exists.  If you own property, and the government deems this property usable for the greater good of the community around you.  Let's say they want to build a power plant, some kind of thing, whatever it is.  They could give you what they feel is fair market value, and you've got to get the fuck out.  You've got to leave.  You have no right to keep your property.  Is that how they built the Long Island Expressway?  I think they did, yeah.  And they just plowed through entire neighborhoods? 
[00:37:00]  Eminent domain on that, yeah, yeah.  I think they just plowed through that shit.  There was a great document.  But that, to me, just seems like...  It seems like communism.  It's crazy.  Or plain old-fashioned communism.  There was a great documentary on the making of Long Island Expressway.  Expressway?  I haven't seen that one.  Or it was about all the...  Robert Moses?  Or it might have been the whole Robert Moses documentary.  Robert Moses.  And they talk about how the Long Island Expressway just plowed through entire old-school neighborhoods  and divided families and stuff, because now they couldn't even visit their neighbors,  because there was a massive highway in the way where it used to be just a two-block walk or whatever. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, it used to be like Horace Harding Boulevard, it was called.  Oh, wow.  Very good.  Yeah, it was just a fucking road.  It's got the name of it, yeah.  And you could actually go across it.  You go across it, so somebody...  And visit your neighbors.  Or your grandma across the street, basically.  Somebody on the north side of Horace Harding could drive right over it and go to the south  side and see people two blocks away, that they've seen their whole lives.  Then the expressway gets built.  And these are people back then who used to walk the two blocks to see families. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, of course.  Now you have a giant expressway in between.  If they didn't take your house.  If they didn't take your house, right.  And now you need a vehicle to get where you're going to go, unless you're going to go way  up to a bridge, which a lot of them hadn't been made back then.  There wasn't a lot of bridges yet.  So, yeah, they completely chopped neighborhoods in half.  It ruined the Bronx.  Like, that's what they say, ruined the Bronx, and the Bronx never recovered.  I'll tell you what ruined the Bronx.  Well, I don't think that's...  The Cross Bronx Expressway? 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  You know what?  I think I got to adjust.  I think that's what they were talking about in the documentary, the Cross Bronx Expressway  more than the LIA, because that was a crowded...  You just sliced the neighborhood.  Yeah, that was a crowded city.  And as revenge...  Whatever, community, whatever, yeah.  As revenge, you can't ever drive on it and do more than five miles an hour.  It doesn't matter what time it is.  One of the worst roads in America.  It's horrible.  That and your stupid belt parkway in Brooklyn.  Go fuck your mother with that road.  They can't use eminent domain, though, for something like an arena. 
[00:39:00]  I think it's got to be fun.  They try, man.  They try and say it's going to bring revenue up.  We could use that revenue to build the community up.  They've tried eminent domain for things.  It's been turned down times.  But the homeowner has to go to court.  They've got to get a lawyer.  It's amazing.  And usually they could be outbid legally by whoever's trying to get their shit.  It doesn't make sense.  I've never understood it.  It's your property.  You own it.  How the fuck can the government come in and decide, you know, no, sorry, leave. 
[00:39:30]  It's really fucked.  Yeah, I agree.  I don't like that.  I don't like that law.  All right.  We should take a break.  I wish they needed my room for something, my apartment for something.  Yeah.  An oven.  An industrial fucking oven.  Or a bakery.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A place to hang, like, hot stuff.  Yeah.  Hot chip.  After the break, Sam went to the Ian Halperin bed-in.  Who? 
[00:40:00]  Ian Halperin.  Sam.  Oh.  His highness from yesterday's show.  The love-hate that the people out there have for Ian Halperin is just off the charts, yo.  Could you please show me one love?  There's a lot of love.  I hate to say it, because then I don't want the people that hate him to win on this one,  because there was a lot of people that loved him as well.  I'm telling you.  I heard people love-  One person actually told me it was the worst radio show we ever did.  Really?  I'm like, how do you-  It was Mel. 
[00:40:30]  How do you breathe the same air as us?  How can you call that the worst show we ever did?  We've done a lot of bad shows.  Oh, please.  I could count ten right now.  It's like finding the biggest grain of sand in the beach.  You trying to put a chip voice on the end of that?  No.  Chip wouldn't even have that one.  I have eggs in my mouth.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Eggs, which I call them hardening cum.  Balls.  But Ian did his bed-in, and we got an update, because Sam went to the big bed-in with the  rest of the media.  When I got here, Sam goes, did you go to the bed-in yesterday? 
[00:41:00]  Oh, yeah.  And I'm like, literally, from the minute I walked out of here until you asked me, I  forgot he was alive.  Of course.  What about his friend Fleese?  That was fun yesterday.  Is it Fleese or Fleese?  Fleese, I think.  Fleese.  He was an odd guy.  He is just an odd little fellow.  He had a story about everything.  And it went nowhere.  That's the beauty of his stories, though.  I know.  That's why it was a good show yesterday.  One time, Joe Jackson left his sunglasses on the diner counter, and we had to tell him 
[00:41:30]  that his sunglasses were on the diner counter.  But he was way more excited.  How was that a period?  And I was like, yeah.  He was way more excited to tell the story.  And what, so what happened after that?  No, it's just, that was the story.  Wow.  Wow.  His stories had a beginning.  Me.  And that was it.  So we'll get the Ian Halperin bed-in update after the break.  Amazing stuff going down at that hotel.  You're not going to believe it when you hear it. 
[00:42:00]  Nice.  All right?  All right.  Morning, everyone.  Tom Petty's 60 today.  Tom Petty.  That's going to be weird for some people, I think.  60.  Yeah.  I listened to him, I was listening to him when I was in high school.  Well, 60.  Yeah, he was probably, how old was he when he was, I guess my point, I'm talking early 
[00:42:30]  80s, he was really big, you know, with the first MTV shit, early to mid 80s.  That's almost 30 years ago.  30.  He's 30, he was 30 years old.  30 in 1980.  That makes sense.  I thought he would be a little older.  Yeah.  Man, I don't know.  I kind of, I kind of liked him in that movie, The Postman.  You see his big acting part in that?  Yeah, I sure did.  God, was he horrific? 
[00:43:00]  They all try a little something on the side.  There was a...  It fails in most cases.  There was an MTV video contest with Petty.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm like a mental blocking over here.  And he had to pick a girl to be in a music video.  I vaguely remember this.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they were like, it was this kind of post-apocalyptic thing, and they were all in a cave, and they 
[00:43:30]  were finding remnants of civilization.  Right.  And Tom Petty and the heartbreakers are in there and everything.  What's the song?  I can't even, I can't remember.  Can't remember.  I don't want to...  But believe me, somebody will bring it up.  Right.  And it was kind of a, it wasn't an audition or see what you can do kind of a contest.  It was just send in and be part of a Tom Petty video.  So they have these chicks that are kind of from, you know, the post-apocalyptic thing,  and they're looking at the heartbreakers, look through some shit on these video screens. 
[00:44:00]  And the girl that won was a fat pig.  She was a pig.  Okay, I do remember that.  And they tried to incorporate her in with these hot chicks in the video, so they would  just zoom in on her face.  It was the best.  Yeah, because they just...  We were laughing so hard.  They just picked someone randomly.  I do remember this.  You would think MTV would, you know, have a barrel for fat broads and a barrel for the  hot broads and pick from the hot barrel.  Is it You Got Lucky Babe? 
[00:44:30]  You Got Lucky?  Or whatever that one it is.  Yeah, that might be it.  You got lucky, babe.  What about you?  Yeah.  I don't like...  Yeah, It's You Got Lucky.  That was the one.  I don't like his radio show as much as I like Bob Dylan's...  Bob Dylan's...  It's less understandable.  Yeah.  Which one is less understandable?  No, our good pal who's now out of work, Lee Abrams, actually taught Bob Dylan how to  talk on the radio.  Did he?  That's a true story.  Yeah, because he kind of does this now.  Right.  It's the Bob Dylan fucking radio show. 
[00:45:00]  Right.  I see.  Yeah, this is the one.  Look how futuristic.  And they're getting out of some kind of a wacky, spacey-looking car.  Tom Petty and the Heartbreaker.  Which song is this?  They had a contest, and some girl won, and there's hot chicks in it, and they tried to  make it one of the hot chicks, but she was a fat pig.  Yeah, they picked a fat pig.  She won the contest.  She won the contest.  No, this is very old.  Almost 30 years old.  Oh, God.  When MTV just did a contest, it was like, all right, send in your name, and you could 
[00:45:30]  win a chance to be on.  And this chick won, and it was so bad.  You know what?  Just fast forward it up, because these were when they made these videos, like movies.  Yeah, like Thriller.  Well, Thriller started it, and then everyone else had to do their long-form video.  Yeah, videos are like the cheapest thing you could do.  And then it turned into, they made major productions out of them, multi-million dollar videos.  It's amazing how primitive they were back in the 80s, right? 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  He's wearing the shades.  Yep, he's got his fucking sunglasses on, they're all...  They're not a tough-looking group of guys.  No, but they're supposed to be, like, in the post-apocalyptic world.  In a tent?  Yes.  You would think it would be a cave or something.  In a tent.  80s tough guys are the worst.  How did the tent survive the apocalypse?  I don't know, but the power's on, too.  They turn the power on, and there's instruments in there, and they start playing.  Well, that's what you've got to do when the whole world has been destroyed. 
[00:46:30]  As long as you can jam.  Who cares, man?  You're in a big tent.  Not a good video.  They turn on the monitors, and, like, it's showing, like, all kinds of things that were happening  when civilization was still around, man.  Oh, and now you see some Battlestar Galactica clips that they threw in there to try to show  what happened to the Earth.  It's a message?  Yeah, it's a message, man.  It's a message.  Of course it's a message.  It's Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. 
[00:47:00]  Where's the fat chick?  I like one song by him.  Running on a Dream, learned on a dream.  That's a great song.  The rest of that stuff can kiss my fan, excuse my language.  Oh, Anthony, a lot of people on, I just got word that it's not Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.  It was Loverboy.  That's right, because she had to wear the big, the headband, and she was a fat bro with a  headband on.  No way!  I remember it being this.  What the fuck?  I guess I'm wrong, but I don't know. 
[00:47:30]  Was it Loverboy did the thing?  A lot of people are saying it's Loverboy.  Sent us a Loverboy.  Loverboy.  Fuck.  By the way, that Tom Petty.  That's coming in a lot, Anthony.  Yeah, that it must be.  Find the Loverboy video.  I want to see Fat Chick.  Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers played on one of Cash's last albums.  Really?  I didn't know that, yeah.  I apologize.  Like Rusty Cage?  That's them.  No kidding.  The listeners and Tom Petty.  I did not know that.  I didn't either, but I think he said it in an interview, like they would have done it  for free.  They were so happy to be doing it.  We got to get Sam.  We got to do some Jack Todber. 
[00:48:00]  Well, what fucking video was it?  We're going to find the video, but I want to get Sam down the hall, and also we just got  word that rent too damn high.  Too damn high.  Jimmy McMillan will be in studio within the next half hour.  We got him?  In studio.  Oh, good, good.  Yeah, Imus doesn't have a problem sharing guests.  Jay Thomas.  I don't care if my boys, Opie, and Anthony want to talk to Jimmy McMillan.  It doesn't matter to me.  Right.  I've always, I love those boys, but they're my boy.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm Opie's Eleanor of fun. 
[00:48:30]  Well, I would hope so.  And I said, thank you, Opie, and thank you for Jimmy McMillan.  What did he say?  He banged my mom at an Islanders game.  At an Islanders game back in, I believe.  God bless Imus.  He said in the 70s.  Thank you, Imus.  I'm sorry.  Back in the 70s.  Thank you, Imus.  Oh, baby.  How did you talk about it?  Look, we help each other out, and we don't even work for the same company.  We're supposed to be one happy family around here, but Jay Thomas doesn't want to share guests.  Yay!  And they just allow it down the hall. 
[00:49:00]  Well, is it a case of we can't have Ira, or just Jay told Ira, I don't want you going on, and Ira said okay?  Oh, I don't know.  No one's talking.  Everyone's saying, oh, this one's said, and this one's said.  It's weird, right?  Yeah, it's all just very, it's vagary.  Once again, there's vagary.  No one's stepping up.  I try to find out what the hell is going on, and no one will step up and tell me exactly what happened.  Queen of the Broken Hearts.  Queen of the Broken Hearts?  Queen of the Broken Hearts was the subject of an MTV contest in the summer of 83, in which MTV viewer won a chance to, quote, star in Loverboy's next video. 
[00:49:30]  All right, that's the one.  Queen of the Broken of floorboards.  I think she had a, like.  Fat jokes.  I think she looked like Mike Love.  I think she had to wear, like, the headband or something.  See, now you can see how I could get confused.  Yeah, they're.  Look, they're in the desert.  They're running in a post-bumpal-alcalyptic setting.  They're also faggots.  Look, there's a cave, though.  That was a fat chick.  Tom Petty was in a tent.  These guys are in a cave. 
[00:50:00]  You're right.  Look, look, look, look.  Now there's a hot chick.  But did you see the fat chick?  She was on for two seconds.  They didn't show her yet, did they?  Yeah, they did.  Go back.  Why are you yelling?  I can't help it.  I'm excited.  Wait.  I've been seeing this in so long.  Watch now.  Right?  There, there.  No, no, no.  That's her.  Look at this.  Wow.  They wanted a hot dog, and they got a fat pig.  They got a fat pig from Bayshore.  And then in the next scene, that was it.  How quick it was.  In the next scene, there's a hot chick blocking her. 
[00:50:30]  Look.  She looks like Dusty Rhodes.  She does.  Oh, that's classic.  They must have been so mad they got a fat chick in their fucking video.  You know how much they must have been laughing at that fat chick?  Loverboy was all about the chicks.  Yeah.  This guy sucked, too.  He played guitar for Ozzy after Randy died, though, Brett.  Brad Gillis.  Yeah?  Brad Gillis, yeah.  They're all dressed like Chess Rockwell.  Did they show the fat broad again?  More hot girls.  There's hot girls.  There's the fat girl.  She's the rock. 
[00:51:00]  There's hot girl.  And where's fat girl?  Wow.  Fat girl got maybe a second.  She got a second so far of video time.  A second.  I bet she was less.  Now hot chicks.  More hot chicks.  Wow.  Five hot chicks.  Five hot chicks.  Fatty nowhere to be found.  On the side of a rock formation.  What's happening?  Why are they all looking at each other rock?  You got the five guys.  You got the five girls.  Five girls and the fat fucking chicks.  What's Fatty's job?  Yeah.  And they're all just playing in the rocks with the wind.  How stupid.  Yeah, the wind and fog and their hair. 
[00:51:30]  This was a huge contest.  The video's half over.  She was in for maybe a half a second.  It was a split of a second.  But, dude, there's no fucking...  Why would you play on rocks with no audience?  Because it's the future.  This is what it was going to be like in the 90s.  They don't need an audience.  They just need each other.  Come on.  Back to the storyline.  I want to see Fatty again.  Yeah, where's fucking Fatso?  Fucking Chaz Bono.  Hey, where's he is?  They are not putting her in this video.  It's so funny. 
[00:52:00]  The video is officially half over.  She got a half a second to maybe a second of it.  We're not putting that thing.  She probably could hear them through the walls yelling about her.  How did Loverboy ever get so big?  All right.  Now the girls are walking very sexily in the dark.  She's not white, though.  No, no.  Where is she?  Where's the fat chick?  She must have been so disappointed being like, I won.  A minute 30 left.  And when the video world premiered, she probably had her family in front. 
[00:52:30]  Like, I'm in this.  But she's so fat, they're probably like, well, that's actually more time than we expected you to get.  Where did she go?  Where is she?  They totally fucking chopped her up.  She was just fucking doing a video.  She was turning a video or something on.  She was in for a second.  Wait, I think that might be a clip coming up.  A head turn.  It could be a head turn.  I'm not sure.  This could be embarrassing.  They just showed two hot girls, three hot girls turning their heads.  The big quick head turn. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  The one turns her head.  They didn't give her a head turn.  She has hay in her mouth.  They just had to spin a Twinkie on a string.  She broke her neck.  There's not much time left here.  Come on, where is she?  Well, they're singing about her.  She's not that kind of girl.  Hot.  30 seconds left in the video.  Yeah.  This was a whole big over-the-top contest from MTV.  Queen of a clogged up heart. 
[00:53:30]  We'll give her...  She got a second in the video.  Maybe.  All right.  There's a chick.  All right.  Chick's coming up behind the guys now.  All right.  Now, 80s girl.  Nobody wants Fatso behind them.  There's a hot chick.  Three hot chicks.  There's another one.  Four hot chicks.  Four hot chicks.  Terrible video.  And...  Oh, my God.  Five hot chicks.  There's a...  Does she get...  No.  She got...  She got maybe a second in the video.  It was a second. 
[00:54:00]  Maybe a second.  Can you time...  There she is.  Can you see how long she's in this video?  But she's literally...  Really try to count.  Dude, she's doing, like, video monitoring or something.  We got to move on because we got Jimmy...  Oh, bring him right in.  Bring him right in.  Yeah.  Really fast, Dan.  Yeah.  1-100.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  A little over a second.  You can't even hit the stopwatch that fast.  A little over a second.  Here we go.  Here we go.  No, it's not a second.  Here we go.  Here we go.  1-100. 
[00:54:30]  It's...  It's 1.3 seconds.  And how long is the whole video?  It was 3.47.  It was about 3.47.  Yeah.  By the way, it's not Mike Love.  It's Mike Rio.  Yes.  I got his name right.  Outside the studio, we got Jimmy McMillan.  Yeah.  Where's Jimmy?  Bring on in.  Bring on in, Jimmy.  Bring in, Jimmy.  Rent is two.  Damn high.  Rent is two.  Damn high. 
[00:55:00]  Look at that.  Nice suit.  Nice button he's got there with the motto, the running platform.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hello.  Hello.  Thank you.  You met the guy.  You met the man, baby.  Here he is.  You are the man.  You're a big star, sir.  And I'm hoping it leads to something for you.  Rent is two damn high.  No, let's say, like I said, say rent is two.  Damn high.  I'm taking deep breaths.  I'm like two.  Damn.  Damn high.  Yeah, that's how you do that.  Yeah.  Damn high.  Damn high.  You are the standout of the debate. 
[00:55:30]  I got to say, because we saw Cuomo, business as usual.  We see Palladino.  That guy, I don't know about him.  And then we, you know, we got Kristen Davis, who's, you know, had her issues and stuff.  And you came up there with a legitimate platform.  You believe the rent's too high for your constituency?  That's right.  And you would like to lower the rent?  They are not taking this serious.  They want to play politics as usual, and I'm not.  I'm 64 years old, and I'm watching all these children grow up with nothing. 
[00:56:00]  And people can't raise their families.  People work at eight hours a day and 40 hours a week, a third job.  I've had enough.  I'm here to you.  I got into this race to be a rabbit.  And, you know, not like I'm making love to somebody.  You know, be a rabbit.  Of course, sir.  To be a rabbit in a marathon.  Set the pace is what I got in this race to do.  You are going to address those issues if I ever sit on the stage with you.  You're going to address the issues that's causing the people to suffer.  And that's what I went to do.  I hit him so hard with, rent is too damn high.  Before Andrew Cuomo knew it, he was saying, rent is too damn high.  And then I heard him say, oh, shit, I'm running for government.  Yeah, yeah.  He agreed with you. 
[00:56:30]  It's almost like me having an argument with him and make him get out and, okay, beat yourself up.  He agreed with you also.  He was like, I agree.  Rent is too damn high.  He don't need to be government.  And do you notice, by the way, the Post, now they have Jimmy here at eight.  Rent is too damn low.  They're implying that you shouldn't be complaining about your rent.  Post endorsed Cuomo.  Yeah, of course.  So they're just going to find stories that are not good about you for Cuomo.  Yeah, Jimmy, that's the big story today.  They're saying that your rent is too damn low.  You live in Flatbush in a one-bedroom, $800 a month, and they're saying you should be paying more for that. 
[00:57:00]  And we just had a whole discussion about it to start the show today.  It sounds like the rent is too damn high for that as well.  Let me tell you what I did.  If you look at my website as an independent private investigator.  We have a tough time looking at your website, sir.  There's too many colors and blinking going on.  We're going to have seizures, sir.  They came after me.  I was shot at going away to the doorway of my home.  And I don't want them camping around my house because I have people that live there.  So I gave them information because I don't want them around. 
[00:57:30]  I told them yesterday, this is not accurate.  I just don't want you.  This is about me and the people.  Oh, okay.  I got you.  It's not about me.  It's about the people.  So that's not true.  So you throw them a red herring and say, no, get away from my house.  I'm not the regular politician like the rest of them.  I'm here to fight for the people.  It's about the people's rent, not Jimmy's rent.  So I gave them that.  None of that's true.  You're paying more than $800, sir?  I pay rent.  And if you are five years old, when you become 18, you're not going to be able to pay rent. 
[00:58:00]  Right, right.  So it's not about me.  It's why I continue to talk about rent.  And what I pay is, as an adult, is not going to help these children live in this city.  But this is why I look at it and say, oh, God, here they go.  The media never let the truth get in front of a good story.  But look at me.  I'm not your average politician.  I am not sitting on – I didn't sit up on that stage to talk about me.  I sit up on that stage to talk about mothers who can't afford to feed their children breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 
[00:58:30]  And they – even the Post and people who write stuff like this, they still don't get the message.  It's not about Jimmy McMillan.  Yeah, yeah, you're not talking about you.  Let's talk about the little child that got up this morning and haven't had breakfast, and they're going to school to learn.  And we're talking about education for the school, and the children are not making good grades when the child hasn't had breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Didn't eat dinner before it went to bed.  This is what – I look at it.  I say, oh, George Bush must have sent them to me to get that story. 
[00:59:00]  But it's a serious crisis.  We are under a rent crisis in the state of New York.  I need you all to help me out here one minute.  Let's say rent is too damn high.  You ready?  All right.  Rent is too damn high.  That's what it's about.  It's not about Jimmy McMillan and rent.  It's about the children who graduated from high school following the attack on the World Trade Center.  We lost 189,000 jobs.  These people are still unemployed.  Most of them are evicted.  They can't find a place to stay.  We've got veterans coming home from the war.  Can't find a place to live.  That's what Jimmy – who Jimmy McMillan and –  Jimmy, I've got a question for you. 
[00:59:30]  We were bringing this up earlier.  You know the renaissance that's been going on in Harlem, right?  They've talked about the renaissance.  Now, this, I believe, is directly due to the fact that they have pushed rents up to push out what they call undesirable people to build Harlem up to where it is.  Now, people are saying Harlem is a much safer place.  It's a lot more tourism is coming in there.  Now, how do you address the fact that that is a good thing for Harlem when it's such a bad thing for the people?  Well, I got on the people of Harlem many times about what I'm going to say. 
[01:00:00]  They don't practice what they preach.  They talk a big game, but they don't vote.  It's about you getting involved in the voting process and not about going running to church praying for Jesus to be a social worker or something.  It's about you getting up off your ass and getting out there to help your people, help your state, get your community right.  I remember when I used to go to Harlem, I wanted to eat collard greens, macaroni and cheese, and cornbread.  I'm a big man.  I had sassberry stick.  I wanted to have all that.  Those places are gone.  I used to be a musician on stage.  I played in a place on 125th Street, Purple Manor, Smallest Paradise. 
[01:00:30]  I used to go and watch Sammy Davis Jr. do his little tap dance and stuff.  Those places are gone.  And when that started to disappear, I started to say to the people, aren't you paying attention?  Something's happening here.  All your socialist life is disappearing.  All your restaurants is going.  And you're still walking around talking about black power.  I was very critical about this.  Let's talk about stick together to help make this state a place.  You lose everything.  Nobody paid attention to me.  Oh, they laugh.  Oh, Mr. McMillan, oh, he look funny with that beard.  You know, he look like Hulk Hogan.  Oh, we're going to vote for him.  The black Hulk Hogan. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, we're going to vote for David.  He's been on the beach for a while.  Oh, we're going to vote for David Deegan.  Oh, we're going to vote for him.  We support Bloomberg.  Oh, we support, what's his name?  The guy who ran for mayor after the World Trade Center.  Julian.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And nothing's changed.  And they're back into the same mess again.  Now, I appreciate what they're writing about me, about the rent I pay.  But I just want to say it's none of your goddamn business.  It's about the children not having food on the table, a roof over their head, and money in their pocket.  It's about jobs, jobs, jobs. 
[01:01:30]  Well, you're scaring people out there.  So they're going to try to knock you down, Jimmy McMillan.  Yes, they are.  They're trying to knock you down.  Do you like that they kind of looked at you like you were a joke ticket, and now you're saying things that really are making them uncomfortable?  Well, my landlord come to me one day and say, you haven't paid the rent.  I said, yeah, so what?  I said, oh, okay.  You know, and the marshal come to evict me long ago.  I've been through my little thing, having struggles as a Vietnam veteran.  I've been in the hospital numerous times.  I'm exposed to Agent Orange with the formed children.  And I say to the people, the politicians are all about them. 
[01:02:00]  I'm different.  I'm all about the children.  Every child is my child.  If you are a parent, and you may not can, you need help.  Well, Jimmy McMillan is here.  I want to make sure your child, I'm tired of your 36-year-old child walking in the door when you and your wife about to get busy.  He should have his own apartment, so I'm going to fight for you.  Rent is too damn high.  And that is what we're fighting for, and I will stay on message.  It is not about Jimmy McMillan. 
[01:02:30]  Our children need a place to stay when they graduate from high school and college and need to be independent and on their own.  Okay, so where is the money coming from so we can lower the rent and still operate these places so they aren't disheveled projects?  Where does the money come from?  People say that I'm a one-issue candidate, and that's just my point.  I have created an economic state of emergency bill that will allow me.  You own a restaurant.  You're paying $12,000 a month for rent, and you live in an apartment.  You're paying $1,800.  I'm going to reduce your rent to $6,000 a month and also reduce your property taxes. 
[01:03:00]  You live in an apartment that was built before 2001.  I'm going to reduce your rent to $650 a month.  But you have to hire some people to work, and if you hire people to work, I'm going to have at least two, three to six million jobs by two and a half years or less.  And when I reduce your rent to $650 a month, you're going to get that money to go out and buy something.  Right away, problem solved.  Oh, so you're saying it brings some stimulus, as they say, to the community?  You've got some money being poured into the surrounding area? 
[01:03:30]  Simple.  Simple.  The president don't have to get involved in this.  You need people up top that can think of what we need.  This is the stimulus for the people.  I understand.  I understand.  Now, how about you say you lower the rent?  Yeah.  Now, how about the guy that was collecting their rent?  Right.  Now, he has less money, and he's not able to maybe hire people, or then there's a teeter-totter reaction with your strategy there.  What about the landlords and the people that were collecting the rents?  They have less money.  Now, they're not able to make as many jobs, and they're not able to spend as much money. 
[01:04:00]  Wait.  Okay.  Landlord collect your rent.  I reduce your rate to $650 a month.  But your landlord got violations against him.  They've been giving him the green light to raise your rent, knowing that it was a violation to do so.  The landlord has been charging him late fee for paying his rent late.  That's a state violation.  The landlord has not returned his interest from the security deposit.  So the landlord has not complied with the law.  He has not been entitled to the rent increases since the moment after the attack on the World Trade Center, because this is where it started.  But I have prepared a plan called a net operating loss for the landlord who you paid all this money for for $12,000. 
[01:04:30]  Net operating loss for him.  For the next four years, you'll be able to fill that out and regain your losses.  Under the president, a reinvestment act and recovery act, the money's already there.  Oh, so it's federal money that will pour into the state to compensate for the landlord.  That is it.  Oh, okay.  It's already there.  I got you.  The problem is the people in Albany right now, they are real estate brokers and real estate moguls, elected officials.  They're not going to cut off the hands that feed them.  And my job is to come and tell the Good Old Boys Network, the party's over. 
[01:05:00]  The party's over.  They don't want to cut your rent, because if they cut the rent, they're taking money out of their pocket.  But I'm here to say enough.  And that's what it's a simple process.  They make it look hard.  But didn't it sound simple?  That's how simple and easy it is to run this government.  Take all the politics out of this and make it easy for the people to live here.  And it's a stimulus for the people.  We've had mortgage fraud, real estate fraud.  As a private investigator, there are real estate Ponzi's going on right now, where they're selling illegal homes. 
[01:05:30]  And homes are going under foreclosure with illegal papers.  And they're still selling these homes.  I pointed this out in 1993.  In 1994, I walked from Brooklyn to Buffalo, New York, complaining about the same thing.  And no one listened.  No car?  Oh, they all mad.  That's what I'd be complaining about.  They all mad.  It's hard to listen when you're zooming by.  It's 70 miles an hour.  They all mad.  When I walked, I slept outside, and I was in the Irondack.  And somebody said, oh, Mr. McMillan, they got black bears up here.  I said, it sounded like family to me.  Oh, damn.  They said, but I said, are they vegetarian?  I mean, they said, they don't eat meat. 
[01:06:00]  I said, well, you better tell them I'm coming.  But I lack meat.  But I had my swords with me and my knife with me.  Did you ready to battle some bears?  Vietnam, I slept in the jungle.  I was ready to kick some ass.  I let them crawl.  I put some urine in a bottle, and I sprinkle my zone.  You cross my line.  Your ass is mine.  I crossed yours, and I knew I had to ask you.  You should have done that as a debate.  But I ran against the father, Andrew Cuomo, and I mean Mario Cuomo in 1994.  Now I'm running against a son.  And I don't like, as being a karate expert, we don't talk about people. 
[01:06:30]  We let the people see what needs to be done.  And to simplify this government and make it simple for the people to raise their children  and raise their family and go on vacation, that is what living in America and living in  this country is all about and living on this planet.  Take all that other crap and throw it in.  I think simplifying politics in general is a very good idea because it's become so convoluted  and confusing to the layman that no one knows what your representatives are doing for you  anymore.  They're not doing your best interest, which they are supposed to be representing you. 
[01:07:00]  Like, I see some laws that get put in place, and you go, what citizen would have wanted that?  How does a representative put that in place when the citizens would never ask for that?  Because he has a stake in it.  Exactly.  You think these storages are popping up all over the state for no reason?  Because the elected officials have invested stock.  Mm-hmm.  You don't, their names are hidden under the corporation.  They have made an investment in storage stock, and they're getting filthy rich.  Every time I go to watch somebody put their stuff in the storage, I want to really cry, man.  I'm a Vietnam veteran. 
[01:07:30]  I came home, and my brothers' families have no place to stay.  When the veterans come home from the ward, they have no place to stay.  They stay to sleep in the street.  I want to let everybody know something right now.  Jimmy McMillan is turning this country, hoping, into a rent revolution where we all need a  place to stay.  The information that you read about me and the rent I pay is bullshit.  I told them that because I'm not a politician.  They can what, what, what.  I'm all about the children, the children who graduate from school, leave the place, and 
[01:08:00]  need jobs, jobs, jobs.  That's what we're all about.  Economic and job, job, job.  It's not about me.  It's no nonsense.  So don't come to me and ask me a story about my personal life.  I used to be a stripper in a nightclub.  I got it on my Facebook page.  Because I know they will come to me.  If you need, if you're an adult, and you need stimulation of somebody, you can't get  it up, call me to come and I'll dance to you and your wife.  But when it comes to the children who need breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and this is  my niece, and she knows that I was used to be a stripper. 
[01:08:30]  You know, the family didn't know.  I had to, I hid it away from the family.  And my mother said, son, why are you telling me I would have loved to come to one of your  shows?  Oh, damn.  My mother's a comedian.  She'll tell you her grandmother is funny as hell.  But the question is that these folks give me love.  They accept me for me being me.  And the question is that, and when I realized that we all, if you see a child, if you're  in a store and you see a child trying to buy something, which I do in my neighborhood  in Flatbrook, they don't have the money, so I walk behind them because the mother told  them, don't take money from a stranger.  I ball up a dollar and I drop it on the floor.  And I said, excuse me, you dropped that? 
[01:09:00]  So this is what you have to do.  You want us all doing that?  We got to start dropping money around?  No, just ball it up and drop it on the floor behind him and say, did you drop that?  But it's not about you.  Yeah.  You may have a heart attack and drop dead.  That little child may see you fall and may come to your aid.  Is that tax deductible, though, that dollar now?  Where?  That crumbled up dollar.  Can I deduct that for my taxes?  My taxes.  But you got to do that.  It's going to make you feel good inside.  You see someone getting out of a cab, go grab the door.  No, what would make him feel good is to actually pick up the dollar that you dropped for the 
[01:09:30]  kid.  And I would say, yo, man, leave it up for the kid.  And the child would say, he'd steal my dollar, you know?  Yeah, yeah, hey, hey, hey.  And I'm going to walk away and the little kid is going to beat you up over that dollar,  you know?  I said, I did what I could do, you know?  But on a serious note, I am dead serious.  I'm retired from the post service on West 38th Street, Midtown Station.  You did everything, it seems.  You have a lot of life experience, my friend.  Well, I used to be a musician on stage.  I played with the Bronzees records.  What did you play?  I did, I played the lead guitar.  The songs are here on my website. 
[01:10:00]  I wrote every, I played every instrument.  And I write all my songs, all the songs that I write is for me to motivate me about talking  about issues of rent.  We're getting old.  I remember when I had all black hair.  I remember when I could take my shirt off and I see nothing but egg rolls.  Now when I take my shirt off, I see the crate.  But it's not about us anymore.  As we get older, the body breaks down.  You know, some of us can, somebody asked you this morning, they said, well, how was it  this morning when you got up?  Oh man, I found it hard getting up this morning.  My mother said, oh son, don't say that. 
[01:10:30]  That's how I'm now saying it.  Hey, either way, that's my work.  I got to say, when we first saw you, we all thought you were just out of your mind.  But I mean, you're not crazy.  This Jermaine McMillan is not crazy at all.  No, he's passionate about what he believes in.  And he has some knowledge behind him.  I mean, taking the mountain down, that's a little crazy.  Well, there's plenty of mountains up there.  I mean, I don't know how we're supposed to do that.  We're all supposed to get a shovel.  Bulldoze in the mountains to create your own cable network company.  Bulldoze the mountains.  I'm an Army Corps engineer who represents the United States military.  As an engineer, I know we can bulldoze those mountains. 
[01:11:00]  We can put cable companies up there.  We can put telephone companies.  We can put our own oil reserve.  Power plants.  We can put industrial.  Yes.  Why haven't?  And think of the jobs to build all this.  But can't we just keep the mountain and maybe bulldoze Flatbush and put all the cable companies in?  Oh, no.  Well, the way the murder rate, the way the killing is going on in Flatbush, maybe that wouldn't be such a bad idea.  I see Jimmy McMillan, everyone.  The children, people are working eight hours a day and 40 hours a week, and they wonder, why is there so much killing?  Why are the kids joining the gang?  Because mother and dad is not home.  They're working three jobs to pay the rent. 
[01:11:30]  Have you ever thought about that?  Have you ever thought about if the rent wasn't so damn high, maybe mothers would be home?  I know some of the fathers I know, the mothers and fathers are broken up because in my neighborhood, it's all about money.  Bitch, you ain't got the money.  I'm out of here.  Because, you know, they're leaving because of money.  It has destroyed family values.  Because what is wrong with us as a human society?  Are we really paying attention to what's going on?  The gangs, you got the whatever the names are in the street, they wouldn't exist if the mothers, I know some mothers can whip some butts from Jamaica.  I'm in Brooklyn, man.  Yo, man, you know, you come out there like that.  You get your behind in the house, you know. 
[01:12:00]  But I have a gun law.  If some, I apprehend someone in the state of New York that has a gun.  They're using your address.  I'm going to give you enough time to call and turn them in.  If you don't do that, we're going to come and padlock the house and you're out in the street.  If you have a child, we're going to adopt them or put them in foster care.  They had enough warnings out there.  You've been warned long enough.  Read my lips.  Jimmy McMillan is not playing games.  I'm not a politician.  I'm taking a tough stand on life, restoring family values.  This is what I'm all about. 
[01:12:30]  I am a parent.  And every child is my child.  And your daddy is coming to the rescue.  Jimmy wants to leave a legacy.  I like that.  That's what it is.  I like that a lot.  I've got to ask you about it.  Full of piss and vinegar, as they say.  A lot of energy.  I've got to ask you about Reverend Al.  Because it seems like, you know, the black community needs some big, solid black leadership.  And it seems like everyone leans toward Reverend Al.  Or that's what we see because he's on the TV representing black America.  I felt insulted because the media stayed with me for a long time. 
[01:13:00]  It's almost like if I wasn't a black minister, I was nobody.  And I had somebody say to me that one day, why don't you do what Reverend Al do?  And I said to myself, I'm older than Al.  I said, what's his mama name?  You know, which means he could be my son.  Oh, shit.  So, you know, your father in the footsteps of your daddy.  I mean, whatever he did, I don't talk about him.  I'm not him.  I'm Jimmy McMillan, the most inspiring, intelligent person who went through Vietnam and looking for POWs called John McCain and people like him. 
[01:13:30]  United States Army believed in me.  So why can't you believe in me?  I remember the general telling the whole resume of soldiers, if you follow Jimmy McMillan, you're going home.  Jimmy McMillan is here today in 2010, sitting in your radio station talking.  So I say to all the people, you vote for me.  You're going to get you out of this mess.  So the same thing applies.  I may be funny.  I may be crazy.  But the United States Army depended on me to bring all the soldiers home.  You're a white soldier.  You lost your leg.  Who are you turning on to get you on that helicopter and get you back?  Jimmy McMillan.  I got three bronze stars from serving the war in Vietnam.  Helicopter flying after we dropped the Marines off and Marines stepped on a landmine. 
[01:14:00]  I jumped my ass out of the helicopter.  I'm not leaving without you, brother.  The helicopter, the lieutenant got mad.  Why are you doing that?  You crazy or something?  Yes, I am.  I'm not going to leave him behind.  You bring your ass back down here and get me.  We picked him up.  This is what went on in Vietnam.  I don't care about my life.  I didn't.  If I put that uniform on to save these soldiers in Vietnam who was on a vigorous attack, how could I be concerned about me?  And the same thing applies.  I don't care what they write about me.  I'm not caring about Jimmy McMillan.  Jimmy's selfless.  Jimmy is selfless.  I'm concerned about you.  I want you to be able to get up out of here and go on a vacation. 
[01:14:30]  When's the last time you had a vacation?  When's the last time you took your girlfriend on a vacation?  Damn.  When's the last time you took your children on a vacation?  It's not about Jimmy McMillan.  Probably not the people that ask.  So you can write all the stories you want to write about Jimmy McMillan.  We get seven weeks vacation.  Full disclosure.  I don't think you're talking about us.  The white man.  I want you to do on vacation.  I want you to do something you would never do.  I did it and it freaked me out.  What did you do?  I want you to go to the beach and I want you to get butt naked.  I want you to walk the street butt naked.  I did that.  I went on the beach and I took my clothes off. 
[01:15:00]  And here comes this brother came walking past me with a thing dragging in the dirt.  I said, oh shit, I want to put my pants back on.  And then I walk about everybody's like, you know, everybody's being themselves.  And I was when I went and stood in the water and I grabbed my hand.  I'm trying to hide what I got.  And then I thought you got a small wiener.  People not paying attention to the house.  You got to be proud.  I look wee wee, you know, but when that water hit it, it went drinking.  But when the water hit it, it went drinking.  Shrink it.  We call it shrinking.  Most importantly, I bring this up for a reason.  Where is your sense of humor?  Can you tell a joke anymore?  No. 
[01:15:30]  Everybody is so uptight that you can't tell a joke or you'll offend someone.  Those days is over.  Look at me.  Like I told the Viet Conga Vietnam, look at me.  They ran the other way.  I would, too.  He's a very intense looking guy.  Yeah, yeah.  I wouldn't mess with it.  What was your unit in Vietnam?  I was with the first cavalry.  I was with two different units.  With the engineer brigade, I was driving the truck to the convoy.  I was driving the truck.  I had a machine gun in this hand shooting out of the dude at the Viet Conga.  I hit the truck and I had a .45 in this hand. 
[01:16:00]  I learned how to drive the truck with my legs because I had to get the supplies to the end of the route.  I was training.  I'm a marksman with a pistol and a machine gun and a rifle.  And we were getting killed too much.  I was watching little babies on the side of the road.  They had cut the baby's leg and put a mine up under the baby.  And we soldiers would go to the train.  We were very sympathetic to watch babies laying on the ground.  And as they were going to pick it up, the Viet Conga would detonate it.  And when I seen the wire, I would get out of the truck.  I would park the truck and I would run to get that Viet Conga.  And they told me again, you must be crazy or something.  They could kill you.  Who's going to kill me looking like this? 
[01:16:30]  And I was really crazy.  You're like Rambo.  You're like the black Rambo.  You hurt an American.  Oh, they're saying it right now.  Rambro.  Oh, Rambro.  Very good.  Rambro.  If you hurt any one of my American brothers, you're going to have trouble out of me.  So what are you looking at now?  The American families are hurting.  The President Barack Obama need help.  His constituents don't understand what he's doing.  He need help.  I'm coming to his rescue in a sophisticated way by running for governor of the state of New York  to show them how this is to be done.  And I'm not playing. 
[01:17:00]  Jimmy McMillan took an oath before he joined the United States Army.  They made me raise my right hand.  I'm still under oath.  Take a hold of loyalty to this country.  I'm still that veteran.  And the people need help.  And here I am.  Rent is real.  Help me out.  Rent is too damn high.  God bless Jimmy McMillan.  Wow.  I don't know what else to say.  What type of karate do you practice?  I gave it a name because it was the most deadly form.  Stop your heart from being with just a touch.  Many times in Vietnam I couldn't find my rifle. 
[01:17:30]  So I had to attack you in the dark.  Just like this, I need to kill you.  So I gave it a name when I came to America.  I took the daily forms out of it.  I called it Shotokan and Nishin Goji Rule.  Because I didn't know how to be treating anyone.  I still talk kind of hard and rough today.  People say, why do you talk so loud?  Well, I was in a bomb explosion.  I lost my right ear.  So I lip read you guys and you guys are talking about it.  If I don't understand you, that's why I say honk.  If I don't understand you, I make sure to say honk.  She gets sick and tired of that.  Why are you wearing your hearing aids?  Why are you wearing your hearing aids?  But I turned it into a lovable form called verbal judo.  You mad at me? 
[01:18:00]  Me?  Why are you mad at me?  Jimmy's very mad at you.  This is verbal judo.  This is what I just see.  I thought he was really asking.  I'm like, no.  No, but you can see him in his body language.  This is what I teach.  This is what I teach.  I teach.  There's no reason.  Why are you mad at him?  What are you mad at him for?  Why are you mad at him, Jimmy?  There's somebody here you may not get along with.  You need to just walk by them tomorrow and say good afternoon.  And then when you do that, they're going to say good afternoon all day around this place.  This is what you want to do.  Don't wake up with a bad attitude.  If you do, you have a problem.  If you're mad at your wife or your girlfriend, you got a problem. 
[01:18:30]  You need to go somewhere and train your mind.  That's what I did.  I'm a single man.  Nobody want to be with me.  I was making out with this girl one day and I said, rent.  She said, what?  What did you say?  Oh, who did you rent?  I'm by myself because I talk about rent too damn much.  Free your mind, you ass of fire?  You know, but that's the form that I teach.  And I teach you, I do this to let everyone know I'm 64 years of age.  You're not dead yet.  Live this life out.  And you all join me and stick with me.  And let's put this country on the right track.  Right now we have went off to the left and the right.  Everybody's talking about race.  If you say something about Jews, you're anti-Semitic. 
[01:19:00]  If you say something about blacks, you're racially discriminated.  Let me tell you, when I grew up on my way to school, there were black folks hung upside the tree.  I grew up with that when I was coming up as life.  That was 1960-something.  This is 2010.  I have a 31-year-old son and I'm waiting on a grandchild and hope she have a child too so I can spoil them to death.  These children need you to fight for them having jobs.  Get the hell out of the 60s.  I lived through it.  Don't take me backwards.  We're moving forward from 2010 and beyond. 
[01:19:30]  Moving forward.  Okay, when Mr. McMillan, you said something last year.  That was last year.  I love that.  That was last year.  I fucking love you.  And they're doing that in my face already.  One of the newspapers called me yesterday.  The Daily News called me.  Mr. McMillan, you said something about the Jews last year.  Give me a break.  This is 2010.  You know, there's a lot of things I did last year.  I went to the bathroom last year using a cheap toilet paper and my fingers went through the middle.  And I had to rip off a corner and wipe my fingernails out. 
[01:20:00]  But now they're using Charming.  They've improved the toilet paper.  And we all improved as time goes on.  You know, this is what I'm saying.  Stop and start laughing.  Start having fun.  When's the last time you laid on your back and let your girlfriend tickle you to death?  Try that sometime.  Let her tickle you.  It's funny.  I get a pedicure and a manicure.  That's the most ticklish thing I've ever had in my life.  I'm tickling to it.  Because when you're a little baby and you're laying in the crib, the black folks do this, they come to you.  Oh, here's what they do.  They used to grab your wee-wee.  Oh, look at your little wee-wee.  Look at your little cute thing.  But when I got older, I'm saying to myself, she grabbed my wee-wee and said such a little cute thing. 
[01:20:30]  This is what black folks do when you're a little baby.  Oh, they tickle your feet.  Oh, look at your little cute thing, little cute thing.  Now I'm tickly-toed.  And if a woman grabbed my nest, she won't lick my balls.  I'll laugh my ass.  Hey, you said that in front of your niece.  I know.  I know.  It's all about rent.  But the people who listen to it, don't even forget your sense of humor.  Have a sense of humor.  Have a sense of humor.  And let's stick together.  We're fighting for social justice.  And we're going to unite together as a people. 
[01:21:00]  And we're going to bring back laughter.  Where's the comedy club?  Ronnie, Ronnie Dangerfield is going to be the comedy club left with him.  We got to bring that back.  Because rent is too damn high.  These places are not here.  Where do we go?  We'll do like I do if I want comedy.  I park my car.  And I just sit in there and I watch.  Somebody going to come by and try to snatch somebody's bag in a few minutes.  Somebody going to, there's no bathroom.  Some lady going to come and stand behind my car and urinate.  Some guy going to come and stand behind my car and urinate on my car.  Yo, man, don't urinate on my car.  But you got a little wee-wee.  You know what I'm saying? 
[01:21:30]  Don't, have that sense of humor.  You got to have a sense of humor.  And this is what's going to get the state, the country together.  Let's stop talking about each other and let's vote for someone who is going to do the right thing.  Leaders are born and not created.  Right now, you're looking at a lot of created leaders.  They want to be leaders.  And I don't talk about Al.  I don't talk about Farrakhan.  I don't talk about Jesse.  All I say about them, I am not them.  I'm Jimmy McMillan.  That means you hate him.  And I'm talking unity for everybody.  I want you to brush your teeth in the morning or go to the dentist and get your teeth fixed. 
[01:22:00]  I want you to go out with that young man.  I want you to open her door and close her door or let her do that to you.  She got muscles and she go to the gym.  Let her open it and close your door.  And I want you to do that.  Get her some flowers.  Don't be afraid.  Don't wait until she die and get sick and take her flowers.  I got in a fight with a guy one time.  I just learned an awesome back spinning back kick.  I seen this guy 6'5 across the street.  I was on 42nd Street.  I told my partner, I said, yo, man, hold on, man.  I said, I got to go and kick his ass.  I want to find one.  Check out this move.  So I broke his little nose and stuff.  I went to the hospital to get him some flowers. 
[01:22:30]  And his focus there, he said, that's the guy right there.  He said, his mother came over.  Get your black ass out of here.  You broke my son.  No, you crazy or something.  I said, ma'am, I'm sorry.  I just tried to try my back kick.  And I just, he was in the way.  I brought him some flowers.  This is real life.  Don't hate.  Don't hate anybody.  And I hope you guys do well here.  You guys are doing a marvelous job.  Well, we are endorsing you.  Absolutely.  Officially.  This show is officially endorsing Jimmy McMillan.  And send them to my store.  I got my website.  I got t-shirts. 
[01:23:00]  I hear the t-shirts are terrific.  People are talking about the t-shirts.  What's the website?  Let's get out the website address.  Rent is too damn high dot org.  But when you pronounce it, you say rent is too damn high dot org.  And go to that store and give us your support.  We need it.  We can do this.  We can do this.  It will happen.  And it's going to happen.  I am Jimmy McMillan.  I'm coming to tell everyone in America, this is a brand new day.  The party is over.  That's great.  How do you feel about prostitution?  I have to ask that in closing.  Of course.  I have to ask that in closing.  Prostitution.  I used to make love to women while their husbands watch. 
[01:23:30]  Ah, cuckolds.  You're that guy, huh?  I have a book on my website.  I have a disease called pride pism.  I came back after being exposed to Asian orange.  I have to go to the hospital and I have to inject a needle in my penis to take blood out.  That's my witness right there.  My niece.  So if I have to go to the hospital, she makes sure everything is fine.  Oh, but wait, wait, wait, wait, slow down.  Why?  That sounds like a hell of a thing.  It's called pride pism.  I have to go to the hospital.  Your boners don't go down.  No, it won't go down.  Once it's up, it's up.  You know, I'd be like, what the fuck? 
[01:24:00]  Come on, man.  I got things to do.  What I do is I learn to wear special tight underwear to hold it down so that it won't.  I have just the opposite problem.  But when I was a young stud coming up, I joined us.  There's a special group for men who have an ED problem and you have a wife.  You will come and pick.  There's five guys who said they will pick the guy they want to make out with their wife while they watch.  And once it began to get up and come up, then you leave.  And that's what I was in there.  I made money doing that because I had a deformed daughter.  No one helped me with my child.  The government said, we don't help you with your children. 
[01:24:30]  You're deformed children.  That's your responsibility.  So I became a stripper and I started working with this organization to get the money to try to help my daughter get the surgery she needs.  So when you become a parent, you have to swallow your pride.  You do what is necessary to make sure you make ends meet and pay your bills.  And that's what dad did.  So you don't have a problem with prostitution.  I'm a prostitute.  I'm a big fan of it.  That's why I asked.  They need these places for men because every man, we're men.  We're an adult society.  You are telling me because I'm a grown man that I can't get a prostitute. 
[01:25:00]  A couple of years, niece.  You know.  The blessed of Mike.  Yeah, the moral treats.  This should be a place for me.  Well, who are you because you belong to a religion?  Say it's against your religion for me to do that.  Now we're talking about gay rights.  Yeah, it shouldn't have any say.  It's none of your business what I just have.  You should be able to marry a shoe, right?  You want to marry a budget by the water bottle?  We learned from you, Jimmy.  Freedom.  Yeah.  Freedom.  Freedom.  You want to.  This is the.  No, I heard that one of the mayors in this state want to ban smoking. 
[01:25:30]  This.  To have made attorneys into a police state.  Uh-huh.  It's what they have done.  And because they don't have.  They're not thinking.  There are many things that they can do.  But they don't have anything else to think about.  These are rich guys who are letting their money work.  Think for them.  Jimmy McMillan is letting his ability do for the people.  The people is what got me here.  And everything that we do is going to be because the people asked us to do it.  And like I say forever.  One of the programs I went on.  They were saying.  Mr. McMillan.  He was saying rent a thousand times.  Rent it too damn high. 
[01:26:00]  But we're going to bulldoze those mountains for you.  Upstate New York.  We're going to have our own telephone company.  We're going to build our own industrial plant.  We're going to have our oil reserves.  New York State would be an independent state.  Independent resources.  You don't have to go to New Jersey and get collard green.  You don't have to go to Florida to get onions.  You ain't got to go to California and get strawberries.  We can grow all that right here.  Self-sufficient.  Yes.  Yes.  Don't need the other states.  Right, sir?  You just set them up.  I like that.  I'm worried that your penis might be too high.  Too damn high.  Too damn high.  He's got to go to the doctor.  Get the needle.  I mean, we're endorsing you.  But we don't want the hard-on to get in the way, sir. 
[01:26:30]  Well, the women think different.  You have to worry about it being too high.  The women worry about it being too short.  He is good.  He is good.  You know, I like having a sense of humor and getting involved in it.  I never forget one time I was making love and she said, more and more.  I said, that's all I got?  Where am I going to get that?  But we as adults have the right to speak our freedom, freedom of speech. 
[01:27:00]  If you don't like what I'm saying, and Howard Stern is my dog, I love the way what they did  to try to censor him for what he was saying.  Freedom of speech.  This is America.  Who in the hell are you to tell me what I can't say?  If it offends somebody, that's called life.  People will be offended by things you say, but they shouldn't then make laws to keep you  from saying that.  Yes, they do.  And New York is about to change forever.  Because when I'm inaugurated, I might get inaugurated. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, inaugurated, right.  Inaugurated.  I'm a country, but I've got a flat tongue.  I might have my G on.  Yes, I got you.  I might have a G string on.  To let the people know that I'm sick of the bull.  Our children need someone.  I would tell the children, get away from the TV.  I might moon you.  You know, they're getting on people now.  They find some guy in the school for mooning.  I might moon you.  So children, stay away from the TV when I get inaugurated because your parents is catching 
[01:28:00]  hell trying to feed you.  I put a lock on my refrigerator when all the kids was, I was trained to come to my house  because they wasn't eating at home.  And then I, the lock was a joke.  Because if you didn't do your push-ups and stuff and do your sit-ups and if you try to  act like you was bad in school, if you came in with good grades, I didn't train you.  When you come into my class, you did 5, 10, 50, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40.  You did your 5 timetables all the way to your 200 timetables.  This is how you teach.  You learn.  Education in schools is what we're here.  But mainly we're here to restore a calm so people can live their families and raise your  children without me telling you how to raise your child. 
[01:28:30]  But I want to give you the resources to raise your child.  If you're a landlord, don't worry.  I want you to hire some people and I want you to pay low rent.  I want you to get married.  Are you married yet?  No, sir.  I want you to get married.  You got no reason to be single.  I get tired of your masturbation.  This is what I want.  I want you all to be happy.  And so I hope everybody agree with me.  And thank you for endorsing the Rent Too Damn High campaign.  Absolutely.  Get out there and vote.  Thank you.  That's right.  Jimmy, Nick Miller.  Our guy.  For the president of the United States. 
[01:29:00]  Screw this governor thing.  Oh, man.  Right to the top of that.  Yeah, right to the top.  All right.  You got to say it one more time as we go to break.  As we go to, we all, we do this together.  Uh-huh.  We say rent is too.  Damn.  Okay.  Ready?  Rent is too.  Then we breathe in.  How do you do it?  Rent is too.  Damn high.  Thank you so much, gentlemen.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Anthony Show.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  I think I might miss my picture with Jim McMillan because I got to do this.

[01:30:30]  Hey, October, October, October.  It's the wonderful month we're in.  You know, VH1 Classic is rocking.  Rocking.  They're going to rock three big shows all in one night.  VH1 Classics has three times the rock.  First at 9, 8 Central.  It's an all-new episode of Behind the Music Remastered.  Leif Garrett featuring interviews, footage, and clips updating the artist's stories over the last 10 to 15 years.  Additional episodes include Alice Cooper, Leonard Skinner, Duran Duran, Fleetwood Mac, and a whole bunch more.  And then at 10 o'clock, 9 Central, it's another episode of Mark Burnett's Rock and Roll Fantasy Camp. 
[01:31:00]  Fifteen amateur musicians hit the Sunset Strip.  And they play with rock legends like Bret Michaels, Lita Ford, Michael Anthony, and Ace Frehley with rock counselors Kip Winger, Rudy Sarzo, and Mark Hudson.  And don't miss the all-new That Metal Show, all-new episode, 11, 10 Central, with special guest Phil Collins and Frankie Benelli.  Back for a sixth season with hosts Eddie Trunk, Don Jameson, and the always entertaining Jim Florentine. 
[01:31:30]  The only destination for all things hard rock and heavy metal is now an hour long.  VH1 Classics, three times the rock, Saturday at 9, 8 Central, only on VH1 Classic.  Ah, fucking Jimmy McMillan rules.  Guy's great.  He's everywhere, man.  He's doing TV now.  He did I Miss, he did our show.  He's got my vote.  I think he blew off some morning TV to do this. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, he blew off morning TV.  He's not smart, I guess.  Yeah, well, you want to click those on when you get a chance?  Look, you go TV over our show.  Come on, let's be honest with each other here.  Be real.  Hey, let's move right into Jacktober, because we've got a really busy show.  Jacktober.  We'll have Jimmy McMillan on again, that's for sure, because that guy's just a funny dude.  Oh, yeah, I threw out the course until Election Day.  You know, we've got to keep up to date on what he's doing. 
[01:32:30]  And he's definitely not crazy.  He's definitely not crazy.  Oh, look, okay.  Slow down.  A little crazy?  He's a little crazy.  Not as crazy as you thought he was.  Not as crazy as I thought.  He's got...  Look, I don't agree with a lot of his ideology as far as his ideas go.  Fun to listen to, though.  But you know what?  I honestly thought I might trip him up on a couple of things about where the money's coming  from and how does this work.  But he did have an answer for it.  Right.  You know, maybe not an answer I'd want to hear or anything, but he did have an answer. 
[01:33:00]  I'm just concerned about the boner.  He has to wear special underpants, he said, to keep his boner down.  To keep his boner down.  Because when he gets a boner, it doesn't go down naturally.  Who's not loving that?  He's got to get blood pumped out of it.  And his niece is involved somehow.  She's the one that takes care of him, makes sure he goes to the hospital, get the blood  pumped out of his boner.  Pumped out of his boner and makes sure he gets to the appearances.  Right.  That's her job.  And I think she's his press secretary, too, because she broke out a camera that was almost  a good camera.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Almost.  It was a little short of a good camera.  Let's do Jocktober, because we've got Bernard Hopkins coming in in about 20 minutes here. 
[01:33:30]  It's Jocktober.  Yeah!  This is awesome.  A celebration of fantastic radio from around this great nation of ours.  Great.  Come on.  Thank you.  So turn up this turntacular radio.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe it.  Yes!  It's Jocktober.  Jocktober.  Jocktober.  And, you know, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and then all next week, so we've got eight  shows left to look at for Jocktober.  That's it. 
[01:34:00]  It does go fast.  This month is flying by, and just when I thought we've done every type of radio show out there,  Sam has brought a doozy to the show today.  Yes, when I heard the title of today's Jocktober show, I was beside myself, and I was even asked,  hey, what do you want to do, this or this?  I'm like, I don't care what we do, as long as we get to Jocktober today.  And we are.  Thank God.  I'm going to just play the sweeper, the first track.  Okay.  To bring it all together.  Okay.  Here's today's Jocktober. 
[01:34:30]  Janet and Lauren, just two moms in the morning.  Boy, what a great show.  On 98.9 Chick FM.  There's a station out there called Chick FM.  It's in South Cackalacky.  WCNT.  South Cackalacky?  Raise up.  Wasn't yesterday's show from North Cackalacky?  That's right.  What are you doing?  Wow.  You've got to spread it around a little bit.  You sure are.  South Carolina.  That's right.  Raise up.  Raise up.  Moms in the morning.  Take your shirt off.  Spin around in the air like a helicopter.  On a...  That's right.  Petey Pablo. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  98.9 Chick FM.  Moms in the morning.  This is the morning show on a station called Chick FM.  Chick FM.  And it is indeed Moms in the Morning.  Moms in the morning.  This has got...  Oh, great.  Look.  The fucking front of the website looks like a tampon box.  It's all pink.  They had to go pink, huh?  Chick FM.  Now, Moms in the Morning.  This, to me, sounds like the kind of show I want to listen to.  That's right.  I'm surprised.  Oh, literal Jim.  Don't forget about their producer, who's also in studio.  Yes. 
[01:35:30]  He contributes.  Another bitch.  I'm a chick.  Is it all broads, or is there a guy involved?  No, the pool man stops by.  Oh, wait a minute.  That's like, hey.  It's the pool man, you know.  Pool man.  The pool man.  Is the pool man burying it deep, or what?  In them?  Yeah.  Not in the Moms.  Come on.  Let's stay in good taste.  Let's move right into this.  The Moms talks.  Yeah.  Is that a real video?  Yeah.  It is real, huh?  It's 747 turning over the Golden Gate. 
[01:36:00]  Is it?  It was...  Gear down.  Why is that?  That looks a little low.  I hear it was part of an air show, right?  Part of some kind of an air show.  It was?  So it wasn't just a commuter plane?  Then it's cool.  Yeah, that's really cool.  They do a nice left bank turn right over the Golden Gate Bridge.  I wasn't sure if that was real yesterday.  That's cool.  It's everywhere today.  All right.  The Moms talks about the president doing Mythbusters.  See, this is what we tell Sam.  We don't want a highlight reel of these shows. 
[01:36:30]  We want one show that we can look at.  So this was yesterday's show, or the day before.  I mean, you guys remember yesterday, you guys were talking about the president on Mythbusters.  Yes, we were.  And you're not the only radio show in the world that's talking about that.  Oh, okay.  Let's hear what the moms have to say.  They talk about the president doing Mythbusters, and guess what, Ant?  The pool man makes a good joke here.  The pool man.  The pool man.  You get to hear the pool man.  It's Moms in the Morning.  You guys ever watch Mythbusters?  I love Mythbusters.  You ever seen it?  Never seen it.  Oh, pool man.  You would love it. 
[01:37:00]  Do you know what it is?  Yeah, I have.  I've seen the trailers for it on TV.  It's really cool.  They take all those things, you know, that people have talked about, or...  Oh, you know, I did see it.  ...things from history, and they try to test them out.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  No.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I think I did see it.  Of course you saw it.  That myth that women suck on the radio.  I said I saw a trailer of it, but I meant to see it in my trailer.  That's what I meant to see it.  Why does he sound like Elvis?  He's from South Kackalack. 
[01:37:30]  Kackalack.  Is Elvis alive?  Elvis is not alive.  He passed away.  He sounds like Travis Lowe.  Oh, you know, I did see it.  Things from history, and they try to test them out.  And then if they can't make it work, they usually, like, kick it up a notch and make  it crazy, just so they can blow something up.  The president has taped a cameo appearance for Discovery Channel's Mythbusters.  Strange.  Very strange.  Oh, what is he going to do?  Why?  Well, this doesn't make any sense to me.  It's going to be airing December 8th.  The president is going to appear in an episode in which they try to debunk the legend of how 
[01:38:00]  the Greek scientist Archimedes set fire to the Roman ships by reflecting the sun's rays  using giant mirrors.  You could call them rays.  That could work, couldn't it?  I think so.  I wonder why President Obama decided to be in on that particular experiment.  Do you think it's something about smoke and mirrors?  I don't know.  That's a good one.  Holy shit.  The smoke and mirrors joke was relatively terrible, but the rest of the banter was all right. 
[01:38:30]  It wasn't great or awful.  It was just nondescript.  It was just kind of there.  The women yapping, though.  It was just there.  Yeah, it was just those voices.  If you were a chick, you'd like that, though.  Oh, would you?  I mean, you know.  I would.  Probably finger my pussy to their female voices.  Squeeze my clit.  To pump it up a little bit.  Just that.  Oh, God.  Look at the mess.  That's why they had the pool man to break it up.  The pool man.  Yeah.  Notice.  What is that?  A Krispy Kreme donut? 
[01:39:00]  She looks like, from the cancer show, Laura Ling Linney, or what's the name of the show?  Yeah, Laura Linney.  The Big C or whatever.  Yeah.  Yeah, she looks like that.  She's not that bad looking.  The other one's a pig.  The other one's a real pig.  Wow.  She shouldn't wear.  You shouldn't wear pink if you look like a pig.  Right.  She's wearing something thinning.  Oh, my God.  Right.  An arena.  Wow.  They talk about mirrors burning.  Lauren doesn't like what pool man did.  Oh, pool man.  He got a little like, come on.  A little mirror. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  You know.  Whatever.  Concentrated and, you know, just like you start a fire only.  Didn't you do that when you were a kid?  Like you start a little fire with a mirror?  You ever do that?  Yes, I did.  Certainly they had those when you were a child.  Yeah.  I used to torture ants with it.  Oh, no.  Everybody did.  Ant bad.  That's sad.  Everybody except Lauren did.  I didn't.  I set pine straw on fire.  Was this before or after the invention of movable type?  I'm just curious.  I'm sorry.  I tease pool man about his age.  He's only a little bit older than us.  That's true.  It's sad.  This is just. 
[01:40:00]  It's just.  What?  Yeah.  It's just.  Why is it sad to burn ants?  Yeah.  Poor ants.  You ever have a fucking ant on you?  It's enraging.  It is.  And you know, she probably pulls the raid out at home and our little kids are running  around to see ants.  Just kill them with poison.  Yeah.  That's better.  Her kids.  She sprays her kids with raid.  No, they get a math problem wrong.  She's a tough cookie.  She certainly is.  You don't want to torture the ants, though.  No, no.  That's sad.  You're loving creatures.  That's sad.  Sam, does this get better or can we move on? 
[01:40:30]  I mean, I think we should still, I mean, we should give them a chance.  Like, I feel like you guys are judging them a little quickly.  I guess there's a dam siren.  Language.  Siren.  Yeah, like there's a siren that goes off.  Is it Hoover?  Yeah, like a dam.  What is it like?  A fucking emergency thing?  So one of their periods happens when they're not expecting it.  Heavy flow.  Their underpants are alarmed so they don't ruin the station seats.  They live in a community where it can be wiped out by a dam or something?  If they have to dam malfunctions or whatever, sure. 
[01:41:00]  All right.  Hey, we warned you earlier, and we're going to warn you again, if you live in an area where  there is any dam nearby, they're going to be testing the dam sirens this morning.  The dam sirens are being tested today around 10 a.m.  So if you hear a loud noise, if you're in Williamsburg, Clarendon, or Berkeley County,  these 15 sirens are being tested.  They're to alert you if there is a dam burst.  So when you hear all that dam noise, there is technically no dam emergency, just a dam 
[01:41:30]  test.  I hate those dam things.  I'm saying this over and over and over.  Well, you might like saying it.  We don't like hearing it.  No.  Yeah, that's me.  Was that their big bit?  Yeah.  Was that the bit?  Do they do bits or?  It's a play on the word dam.  Oh, shit.  Do they do prep burger or song parodies?  No.  They rely on their own comedic expertise.  Just banter.  Well, God bless them for that.  And writing.  I mean, that's good stuff.  Damn.  How good would it be to roll a bowling ball into her crotch in the middle of that pit? 
[01:42:00]  Just listen to it splat.  Damn bowling ball.  Yeah, right against my damn lips.  Well, good news.  Why stop the damn jokes now?  Do you think there are damn hunters out there?  I don't know.  Do I hear it?  The warning is for damn hunters, damn boaters, and damn neighbors.  Hey, we don't live near a dam, and I've got some.  You hear sirens?  No, but I've got some damn neighbors.  I live in Hollywood.  We hear sirens all the time.  Anyway, there's no damn dam anywhere near us. 
[01:42:30]  I have great neighbors.  I just love saying damn when I'm allowed to.  It's the D-A-M kind.  Allowed to?  You know if the kids aren't in the car now going to school.  No, it's the dam.  We're talking about the dam.  It's like a beaver makes one.  Right.  This is a big human made one.  It holds back the water, and they have to do these damn tests.  Exactly.  Because people have to know if there's any kind of problem with the dam.  All right.  You know, flood.  We've got to be careful.  We don't want a damn flood.  My point is, by the time you hear the damn sirens, you better kiss your damn butt goodbye,  because it's pretty much over.  Easy.  Are they doing, like, a Dickens coffee bit right there? 
[01:43:00]  Dickens cider.  No, Dickens coffee.  Here he is.  We changed it to Dickens coffee.  Dickens coffee.  Everyone knows that, Sam.  What's wrong with you?  Literally, a minute ago, I said it wasn't that bad.  It went from that to the worst thing I've ever heard.  Yes.  Did you hear when she said, I don't live near a dam, but I have damn neighbors?  Damn neighbors.  And then they kept going, and then under the talking, you could hear her go, oh, I'm just kidding.  My neighbors are great.  Right, right.  Of course.  She has to.  Everything's got to be good.  And she loves saying it when she's allowed to, because damn is such a bad word. 
[01:43:30]  Well, that girl has to have neighbors that are all sex offenders, and she said they're  great, and while she's saying that, someone's being murdered two houses down.  See, because there's no N at the end of the damn that they were saying, but it did sound  like that.  No.  That's why they had to clear it up for the kids.  That's wonderful.  They want to make sure that.  It's just terrible.  Everyone got pissed off by their damn jokes.  Well, what if they thought they were using the D word?  Oh, what's that?  Douche?  Douche is ya.  Damn.  Oh, that's the one with the N. 
[01:44:00]  This is an XL channel, but.  Oh, all right.  Well, they talk about Barbara.  That God, we're on XL.  Barbara Billingsley's scene in Airplane.  Oh, yeah.  They go out of their way to not mention that the men are black.  Why?  Wow.  Remember the You Speak Jive scene?  Yeah, that's black guys.  No, no, no.  It's gentlemen.  It's fellas.  It's people.  Oh.  It wouldn't say guys.  It's those two black guys.  Boy, this is so safe.  In person.  This is the safest radio ever.  It has to be.  They're called moms in the morning. 
[01:44:30]  I know.  You could say black.  I bet you could say that when they say all their pussies get wet, they don't say black  just because it soaks them all up.  When they think of the Jimmy McMillons of the world stopping over while their cuckold  husbands watch.  He has to have his cock drained medically so big and strong.  Fucking McMillan rules.  Jimmy McMillan's big cock.  I want to put a flag on it.  His cock has to be drained.  His cock's got to be drained.  Take that fucking Andrew Cuomo.  That's right.  What do you got going on?  That fucking trust fund douchebag Cuomo.  Exactly. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, he stinks.  I hate them all except for Jimmy McMillan.  Jimmy's great.  I like Chris.  I have faith in politicians now.  So, hey, they talk about Barbara.  All right, let's just play it.  At 8.06, we were talking about this in the studio, and I said, you know what?  We should do that on the air again because we talked about it early yesterday, and it  bears repeating.  Barbara Billingsley passed away over the weekend, the uber mom for all ages, Beaver Cleaver's  mom off Leave it to Beaver.  If you haven't seen Leave it to Beaver, you haven't seen classic television from the 50s  and 60s. 
[01:45:30]  Barbara Billingsley played Beaver's mom, and you saw the movie Airplane.  She was the lady who was seated when the gentlemen were trying to talk to the stewardess, and  she couldn't understand them, and she says, excuse me, stewardess, I speak jive.  There's an interview with her.  We put it up on our Moms in the Morning Facebook page.  You can get there through our website, 989chickfm.com.  She's talking about being picked for this role and how it came about, and the director, the  first time she did it, you know, because she had to speak in that unusual cadence and use 
[01:46:00]  words that she ordinarily wouldn't use.  Oh, my God.  And the director said, that was good, but I need you to do it again because I could understand  what you were saying.  So she had to...  She was enunciating too carefully to jive talk.  Right.  She had to go to lunch with the two dudes who were the jive dudes.  I thought one of them was Sam Jackson, but it wasn't.  He looked just like it.  That's racist.  Well, because they all look like.  Oh, because they all look alike.  When you see the racism at the end of the clip.  Yeah, we all know.  Yeah.  It's funny, they won't say the word black until the very end, and I thought one of them  was Sam Jackson, but then again, they all are subhuman criminals.  All right, back after this. 
[01:46:30]  They just keep it for that last second there, racial hatred.  And now a commercial for Tampods.  It's just, yes, they were speaking a certain way, a certain type of dialect, talking like  ****.  Imagine if the moms in the morning just completely lose it.  And they're just hardcore racist.  Yeah, they've been fined for racism many times.  They've incited race riots.  We just don't know it.  These gentlemen.  She looks like a beat-up Laura Linney.  I think that's her name. 
[01:47:00]  Oh.  Yeah, a little bit.  A minute ago, you said she was all right.  Now she's a little more beat-up.  A little beat-up.  Look at the plate of food in front of her, Sam.  Oh, my God.  Her tits on a biscuit.  Fucking fat bunt.  Let's slow down with the carbs there.  Where's the pool guy?  I don't know.  I haven't seen any pictures of the pool guy.  The pool man.  I bet he scoops his cum up with a skimmer.  That's why they call him that.  Because he comes in all their coffee when they're not looking.  The moms talk about some hilarious tricks they've played.  It's amazing.  It's bad when other people spill the beans on your Facebook page, too. 
[01:47:30]  A friend of mine is newly pregnant.  And she wasn't telling people yet.  Because it was very early.  She hadn't even seen the doctor yet.  Well, she told somebody.  Well, yeah.  If it made it to Facebook.  That's right.  And somebody congratulated her on her Facebook page.  And she had to quick.  I called her and quick get that out.  Because, you know.  Well, when I used to.  Some things you want to wait a little while to tell people.  And you want to tell them face-to-face yourself.  So it's one thing to spill your own secrets.  But it's another thing to, you know, spill someone else's.  So think about this.  To spill her blood.  I was four days overdue with fun. 
[01:48:00]  People were saying, when is that baby coming?  And I would say, what baby?  It was awfully fun.  So that works at all stages of pregnancy.  We used to do that when people asked us when we were going to get married.  My husband and I, when we were dating.  Because we dated for five years before we got married.  Did you?  And I would just look at him and like, well, he hasn't asked me yet.  You know?  What?  Come on.  Come on.  It's awfully fun.  Come on.  Holy cow.  It's light and fun.  Again, I'm mad.  Why? 
[01:48:30]  Before we got married.  Because this is on.  And I would just look at him and like, well, he hasn't asked me yet.  You know?  Like, that's uncomfortable.  Was it true?  It was true.  I mean, you know, we dated three or four years and he had not asked me yet.  We planned on it.  Did you fuck?  But I mean, it's just not a very polite question.  Did you suck his cock?  Or when are you going to have a baby?  That I understand.  You've been married how long and you ain't had a baby?  Oh, that's very hurtful.  It is.  It can be hurtful.  Extraordinarily hurtful for someone saying, well, I've been trying for five years.  Or I can't have any.  Whoa. 
[01:49:00]  I store marbles in my womb.  Yes.  My ovaries shot out one night when I sneezed.  Thank you very much.  They look like old daisies.  My ovaries are worthless.  Like raisinets.  I threw them in my cereal and ate them.  Fucking worthless ovaries.  The NFL sucks.  Sorry.  What are they doing?  Fining players for hitting too hard.  And the hit from this weekend, it was a good hit.  Sorry. 
[01:49:30]  Just bad luck.  They're just showing it on TV.  We look at the TVs and jump around.  Stroke a bad luck.  But you can't start fining guys for, you know.  Hitting people in football.  Legal hard hits.  Yeah.  Dirty hits, sure.  Why not?  It's going to make football that much more exciting.  Well, I told you a while ago, football could be the first sport where these guys get way  too big and it ruins the fucking sport.  Yeah.  It could be the first one.  They're just all monsters.  They're just getting bigger and stronger to the point they're not going to be able to  have the right equipment for these guys.  They're just hurting each other. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  And this could be the first step of that if they're going to find guys for hitting too  hard.  They didn't have that in the 70s, the 60s, and the whatever.  The Moms in the Morning.  They preview tomorrow's show.  Oh, that means this is the last clip.  Thank God.  I mean, unless you want to hear today's show, I'll grab a couple clips.  We don't need to do a long Jocktober today.  No, no.  We really don't need to.  Thank you.  They preview tomorrow's show.  They're going to talk about, well, I'll just let it sit there for a second.  And we're going to talk about the Octo Doc. 
[01:50:30]  The Octo Doc, who helped the Octo Mom get pregnant when she already had six kids and  he helped her get pregnant with eight more.  He may lose his medical license.  Is it any of his business?  How many kids she has at home?  Or did he do wrong?  He's in the Octo Dog House.  Yeah.  He could be, you know, getting octo-welfare before this is all.  Are these more damn jokes?  No, Octo jokes.  But it's sort of like the damn jokes.  Well, the damn jokes at least somewhat made sense.  Yeah, that does not make any sense. 
[01:51:00]  She's just putting the word Octo in front of things.  She should open her legs and put her fingers in her Octo dumpster.  Eight fingers at a time.  Well, this is all said and done because he might lose his livelihood.  We'll talk about that tomorrow morning because some folks think, hey, she asked for it.  She paid for it.  No problem.  Yeah, but that was irresponsible.  I'm sorry.  Oh, shit.  We had a fertility doctor in here on Friday who had a couple of things to say about it.  So, anyway, we just thought we'd throw that one out there.  It must have been a fun show. 
[01:51:30]  Give us a call.  How about you throw your show out?  You can always find us on Facebook.  You can link to that through our website, 989chickfm.com.  Have a lovely, lovely Tuesday.  It's a beautiful day outside.  Enjoy it, everybody.  8.57.  This wraps up another Moms in the Morning.  I'd say that was a pretty successful broadcast.  Join us next time for more Janet and Lauren.  Well, you don't seem very excited about it.  I am excited.  Can you not act very excited about it?  What do you want me to do, take out an ad or something?  I'm very excited.  And stay tuned for more of your music. 
[01:52:00]  Next on 98.9chickfm and 989chickfm.com.  The radio just sucks.  You don't like it anymore?  Oh, God.  Well, that one wasn't that bad.  It's a very good day.  That was terrible.  It's a beautiful day out.  I guess that's how women talk, I guess.  Awfully.  That's why no one listens to them.  Yeah, yeah.  That's why we jam our dicks in there.  That's how blowjobs were invented.  Fucking caveman heard the first chick radio show.  It's like, how do we stop that noise from coming out of the thing that isn't a vagina?  Put your dick in it. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, caveman radio.  Yes, they did.  They were talking to coconuts and rocks to get traffic and rape updates.  Those caveman loved the rape.  Oh, they lived for it.  Oh, love it.  Just tear your...  You know how bad pussy smelled when it was covered with animal carcass?  Horrid.  When they sit down and just dirt and rocks and shit would get in there.  Have to wipe it off.  Usually you're spitting pubes out in the old days and then it was like a pebble.  Rocks.  You don't think they went down on a... 
[01:53:00]  No.  Because dogs do that.  Dogs would...  We'll get right in there.  Yeah, dogs do.  So like animals, they would go up there.  Because in order to get hard, they'd have to do that, I think.  Must have...  Because they're just animals.  It's not like the chick's going to lean over and start giving them a handy.  I don't know.  Is Bernard here?  Isn't this the same break that moms did?  Oh, it's close.  But why don't you guys end this show with, have a great day.  We should be a little more nice.  It's going to be a lovely Tuesday or Wednesday in this case. 
[01:53:30]  You know what?  We're going to try that today.  Are you?  Yeah, certainly.  We'll do that.  I think the people deserve it.  Octo equals funny.  Who said that?  It's Will.  How do you argue that?  I mean, I think it's pretty easy.  Let me say hi to Sean in Georgia.  Sean!  I hope you're completely wrong about what they're fining them about.  They're only fining them for illegal helmet-to-helmet hits when they launch themselves headfirst  into the other person's head.  I heard the NFL wants to start possibly fining if these guys hit too hard legally. 
[01:54:00]  Where'd you hear that from?  From Patrice's Twitter.  Patrice's Twitter.  I think it might have been Big Mom of Prouds.  I think it was.  That's what I saw.  What's the real story here?  Who knows?  I just know what I read on Patrice's.  Well, Patrice is pretty accurate with his stuff, right?  Helmet-to-helmet hitting.  Helmet-to-helmet hitting.  Of course, Danny.  Another opportunity to pull up his docking pictures.  I hope Bernard Hopkins walks in and just sees you looking at that.  Fucking knocks your teeth out.  33 across. 
[01:54:30]  He's gone.  Okay.  Well, what's the real story with the hitting in the NFL?  What do we know?  I'm guessing like he said.  I think you're right.  I think I did read Big Mom of Prouds.  It's probably just too fucking head-to-head.  Well, head-to-head is...  Head-to-head a legal hit.  It is, right?  So I was sort of right, too.  If it's a legal hit.  I have no idea.  I got my own problems for another couple of sporting nights.  Yankees are not doing well.  Your suffering will be over today. 
[01:55:00]  You going to the game today?  Yeah.  You're going today?  Yeah.  What time's the game?  They're playing every day.  Yeah, they want these games done.  They want the games out of the way so we can watch the Jets win the Super Bowl  and the Islanders win the Stanley Cup.  Enough with this.  Oh, it's been in the works for a while.  What's with the Phillies and the Giants?  What's the score there, Sirius?  As I look down on that one.  Do you know it or not?  I don't know.  Giants 2-1.  Oh, good.  Okay.  Over the Phillies.  Two games to one.  Fuck, the Yankees are going to get knocked out. 
[01:55:30]  When's the last time the Rangers were in the World Series?  Rangers are a strong team, man.  They're great.  Have they never been in?  Nope.  All right.  So this is a good story.  It's not a good story.  It's a great story.  It's a great story if they're fucking all killed.  It's a great story.  It's not a good story.  It's a great story.  It's a great story.  It's a story of the Yankees not making it.  That's the story.  Yeah.  It's a lousy story.  Fuck Texas.  It's a great story if the Yankees won and Jim got blown.  That story would rule for everyone.  While watching the Yankees win.  No, they won while watching me get blown.  Oh, wow. 
[01:56:00]  That's a good one, too.  Oh, he's on his way up.  Yeah, Bernard's on his way up.  Bernard Hopkins.  Oh, shit.  It's just nuts.  He's fighting at 45 years old, Bernard Hopkins.  That, you have to hurt in the morning after that.  It's just.  Wow.  I think he's 40.  Yeah, 45 years old.  The guy he's fighting Pascal is 27. 
[01:56:30]  27.  All right.  As he walks up, let me get some NFL action here.  Victor, explain this to me, please.  Really fast.  You only got maybe a minute.  Okay, what's going to happen is when a hit occurs on the field, the referee's going to  determine whether or not it was helmet-to-helmet or legal.  If it's a helmet-to-helmet hit, the player will be flagged with a penalty, and then the  NFL commissioner will take up to three days to review the footage and determine whether  there are not any penalties or suspensions will be levied. 
[01:57:00]  Who asked you?  You guys.  Oh, sorry.  Oh, literal caller.  I'm trying to get some knowledge out there.  So.  All right.  Have a good one, guys.  But aren't you allowed to hit helmet-to-helmet?  I'm confused.  I thought that's what the helmets were for.  I think you were allowed to hit helmet-to-helmet, but now they're saying if it's done too hard,  now they can penalize you or find you.  Probably intentional.  That's why it's taken so long.  They'd have to review the page and look to see if it's intentional.  But the game's over at that point.  If you put your head down, you're fucking, yeah, but they could still fine you or suspend  you or whatever.  Well, there's a difference between a face mask and an unintentional face mask, 15 to 5 yards. 
[01:57:30]  So this is probably the difference between what they see as an avoidable hard hit and  one that just happens.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And with that, we say hi to Bernard Hopkins.  Oh, good.  Yes.  Welcome back to the show, sir.  Thank you.  Thanks for having me.  How are you, buddy?  How are you, buddy?  How are you, buddy?  How are you doing, man?  Good.  Good.  Fighting, are you?  Yes, sir.  Yes, you are.  Ann said that, you know, your age, you look like you're in amazing shape, obviously,  but you're 45 years old and we're around the same age. 
[01:58:00]  Just basic nature.  It's got to hurt a little more.  In the morning?  A little more?  No, but I think you live different than I did.  Probably.  I try to stay in shape, but I mean, just...  This is the lifestyle.  You know, it's been a lifestyle for me.  Yeah.  When, you know, yeah, I got aches and pains when I was in my 20s and 30s.  And yeah, some are different.  A little different.  But at the end of the day, you learn how to manage that.  As you get wiser, of course, that comes with aging, some of us, not at all.  Wait for that to happen.  Yeah, but I'm good.  I'm good. 
[01:58:30]  I'm good.  How long after a fight does it hurt?  Like, yeah, you see guys come out of the ring.  It's like, how many days are you like, just, you don't want to move?  Just laying a bit, huh?  Yeah.  Two, three days.  I'd say about a week.  I'd say about a week.  You lay around a week.  One thing about a boxing, you know, it's punches that somehow that you can't, you know, register  all the punches that hit you in your body, your arm, your hip, your whatever.  And the next day, you say, where did I get this lump from?  I don't remember getting, I mean, back of your head, back of your neck, your shoulders.  So, I mean, I got a lot of respect for football players because I understand they got more 
[01:59:00]  than one person they got to meet.  But I know how I feel with one guy in there with him in the ring, whether I win the fight  or lose the fight.  You come up with some, like, lumps and bruises that you don't even remember even getting hit  with.  Where's the worst place to get hit as a boxer?  Besides the obvious knockout punch.  But where's that one spot?  The very worst place?  Yeah.  Low.  Oh, yeah.  Low blow, low blow.  Low blow, low blow.  But, yeah, yeah, that's one of the worst.  I don't know how you guys shake that off so fast sometimes because a lot of times the 
[01:59:30]  guy's like, oh, he's on the road.  He's pulling his fucking shorts out of shit.  You can't shake it off, buddy.  That's the point.  You can't shake it off.  What you do is you just say, I got to suck it up.  And sometimes, you know what?  I mean, the worst thing is, and I experienced this person, I know this is a kid show, Disney,  but at the end of the day, you know, I remember getting knocked out of my cup, if you know  what I mean.  Oh, shit.  Eight rounds I had to go.  Oh, just, hey.  This was painful. 
[02:00:00]  Swinging in the breeze.  It was just swinging in the breeze.  And I couldn't even use it, for God's sake.  That's what made me mad.  Because I couldn't use the damn thing.  Oh, damn.  I like Bernard Hopkins.  That's got to hurt.  But how great is the other fighter?  How was the fight?  I lost, but I punched his dick out of his cup.  That's great.  That's history.  That is history.  Holy shit.  That doesn't happen all the time.  Did you win the fight?  Of course.  I won the fight.  That's a good one.  And I've been winning a lot of fights over a lot of years, as I know.  And I'm blessed to continue to do what I do at the advanced age of, what, 45? 
[02:00:30]  I'll be 46 in January.  So when the fight comes, getting near, December 18th in Corvette, Canada, I'll be less than 30 days shy of being 46,  which will surpass George Foreman's historical win over Michael Moore.  When George was 45 years old, he did the unthinkable.  He beat a young 26-year-old Michael Moore.  When did he come back to fighting?  He was 40-what?  George Foreman, I think, was 42, maybe 41. 
[02:01:00]  Remember, everyone thought he was completely insane at the time?  Yeah, I did.  And then, obviously, he proved everyone wrong.  He proved everybody wrong.  It's like, George is back at 42?  But George Foreman always had that punch.  Yeah.  And in boxing, especially if you're a heavyweight, really, that's all you need.  Remember shaking his hand that day at the studio?  Yeah, it was like a shaking a bear.  It was giant.  He's a giant.  Foreman, he was a bully in Houston.  Like, who are the guys that do other fighters?  He used to bully other fighters when they were kids? 
[02:01:30]  He used to bully the bullies.  Yeah, Foreman was a frightening guy, man.  And then he got, Ollie beat him.  And can you imagine what he would have done if he didn't go away for so long?  That's, like, frustrating as a fan.  You're like, what are you doing, George?  A lot of heavyweights that became champion would never become champion.  Of course not.  I'll tell you that right now.  Of course not.  You think he hit harder than Ernie Shavers?  They said Ernie Shavers is one of the hardest punches ever.  You think Foreman hit harder?  Well, Ernie is different punches.  You got George Foreman, thump.  He was, like, getting hit with a tree log. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I had no experience in that, but, you know, back in my day in Philadelphia, you know, before I turned sane, you know, I know what the tree log feels.  I've seen the reaction of it.  But at the end of the day, Ernie Shavers, the acorn, right?  They call him the acorn.  He was more of a snapping, punching, which, I mean, a quick jolt and, you know, speed kills.  And he wasn't heavyweight.  He wasn't super fast, but he was faster than an ordinary heavyweight. 
[02:02:30]  George Foreman was just a, I mean, he would clob you.  He would clob you.  It's like getting hit with that fucking gorilla head.  Right.  George Foreman would miss you and knock you out.  Yeah.  Wait, did you hear that?  He hit Joe Frazier.  And he missed him actually?  He lifted.  They fought twice.  Right.  I don't know what Joe was thinking about.  He fought twice?  He fought twice.  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  And it was a rematch.  Now, when a guy knocks you out in the fifth round, the first fight, you don't ask for a rematch.  I mean, what could happen in there? 
[02:03:00]  Three rounds?  And what he did knock him out two times.  He knocked him about three to four inches off the canvas.  Damn.  He got a famous pitcher.  I can't forget it.  George Foreman and Joe Frazier.  Joe Frazier had on white shorts with yellow trimming.  And he got hit with an uppercut.  Oh, damn.  He had that style.  He had that style.  He crossed.  And his feet is about three, four inches off the canvas.  And he launched him.  That was a, yeah, that was, I think he knocked him down like six times.  It was a horrible, and frustrating. 
[02:03:30]  It was a tough dude, man.  He didn't win a second in that fight.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, Foreman was a notoriously fucking frightening guy.  And Ali wins the fight in Zaire.  How, as a fighter, if a guy was, because Ali was so smart to taunt these guys.  But Ali won here first.  In his head, right.  He was a smart fighter.  Ali got the fans, and he got the, excuse me, I'll cut you off.  Go ahead.  No, no, no, but I say, as a fighter, how frustrating would that ruin your game if a guy did that  to you?  Because Ali did outsmart him.  Like, would that, as a fighter, throw you off if your opponent was taunting you that much? 
[02:04:00]  Well, not me, because, you know, I'm famous.  I got some history.  I'm on the flag in Puerto Rico.  You know what I mean?  I, when I fought Tito Trinidad, I did a gutsy move that I'm not boasting and bragging about  it, because it was part of the promotion, and I had a lot of Spanish friends, and I  like to go back to San Juan when I'm allowed back in there to eat, and then we whatever.  But me and Tito fought, and we had a press conference in New York, and then we had a  press conference in San Juan, and I wanted to get in his head, and I took that flag, and  I put it on the ground.  And we started out an all-national riot.  I mean, that was posted on networks that didn't even show anything about boxing. 
[02:04:30]  So, that made a really, really, really controversial promotion hype.  I'll never forget it.  2001, the fight was canceled because of 9-11.  We fought at Madison Square Garden, one of my greatest performances.  As people know, I won that fight, and I became the undisputed middleweight champion of the  world.  But yeah, I love the hit game, but you have to be able to back it up.  You have to walk that walk and talk that talk, or talk that talk and walk that walk. 
[02:05:00]  So, what do you think, as a fighter, what's motivating you at 45 to fight?  Obviously, you're still in great shape, and you can still do it, but a lot of guys just  want to, after a certain age, want to just relax and enjoy the money.  I'm sure you're okay financially.  So, what is it that makes you want to just do it again?  Well, other than loving the sport and loving what I do, I've been competitive for a long  time.  I believe I had a late start in boxing.  I had a trouble pass.  I overcame that.  I won my first title at 26, which is considered not a senior citizen when you're boxing, but 
[02:05:30]  it ain't a young 19 or 20-year-old like Oscar did and Fernando Vargas and the great young  fighters that became old fighters.  I think that time is not on my side forever, but time is on my side to lead fight a few  fights, first this one winning championship, and then give them a rematch, and then see  what I think of continuing or retiring.  But, you know, my situation is a little different than anyone else. 
[02:06:00]  As I advance in age, I also invested in my age early on, 20s, 30s, and I take care of  myself.  If this can be a message to anybody, I don't care if you're an athlete or you're everyday  working people, you must take care of yourself early, like an investor, and you will get  the dividends and you will get the blessings later.  I'm in a hard sport.  I am a physical sport.  I'm not in a shape where I've never been punched or I've never been hit. 
[02:06:30]  It's going to be some effects to any boxer who boxed for a long time, especially over  two decades, which I have.  But at the end of the day, I love what I do.  I respect what I do.  That's why I keep myself in tip-top shape every time I step in that square circle.  And when it's over, trust me, I know people's heard this before.  We know when to quit.  It's do we know that some fighters don't know how to quit because of certain financial 
[02:07:00]  reasons, because the crowd that they intoxicated about.  With me, I have a lot of good business going on, a lot of good people in New York and also  in Philadelphia, Miami, and L.A. with Golden Boy Promotion with Oscar De La Hoya.  I do have a niche to go and sit back and grab a virgin pina colada and sit back and relax  and smell the roses.  But I'm an honest hustler.  And I like business.  I like being in the light, whether it's at the table, at the office, or is it in the ring. 
[02:07:30]  But I know that the ring is going to end and is ending, but it's not going to end on anybody  else's turn but Bernard Hopkins.  I will end with dignity, I will win this title and be the oldest fighter in boxing time.  That is huge.  This is my motivation of fighting.  This is motivation.  This is motivation for me to make history again.  And you know, 21 defenses as a middleweight champion, I don't believe anybody in any era  is going to break that record.  Moving up two-way classes, being a 5-1 underdog, and beating Antonio Tarver for the light heavyweight 
[02:08:00]  championship of the world, that Ray Robinson and New York City, over 30 years ago, came  out, couldn't come out for the 15th round to achieve what I achieved.  And that's my hero, Sugar Ray Robinson, and also Marvin Hagler.  I achieved that goal and became the first middleweight ever to win a light heavyweight championship,  jumping two-way classes from 60 to 75.  And now here we go again, fighting a young, unbecoming, confident guy who just beat, supposed 
[02:08:30]  to be, and was, the top guy at 175 pounds.  Here's, I'm not fighting a queen puff here.  I'm fighting a guy that's, you know, I'm really close enough to be his father.  And I will be December 18th.  Hey, Onum, when you watched Tyson's last fight, as a boxer, what's a scary way to end  the career?  Because Tyson's like, I got no heart for the fight anymore, I don't want to fight anymore. 
[02:09:00]  There was kind of a sad ending to a guy who was a very, very tough dude, to see him just  kind of broken down a little bit there, instead of just, what's your worst nightmare?  I can respect that when you fight and you end the fight trying to win.  Whatever the outcome is, it's the outcome.  But quitting is unacceptable.  Fighters don't quit.  And when you end that way, as you ask me, what's the worst way to lead a game or similar 
[02:09:30]  question, similar, the thought of my mind is that you have to lead with dignity.  Win, lose, or draw, that's still dignity.  You know what?  You'll leave out of that auditorium or that arena and say, you know what?  My guy didn't win, but boy, he put it out there.  And the fans know.  And so at the end of the day, when you sit on a stool and you say you don't want to 
[02:10:00]  go out there no more because you don't want to get hurt, we're in a hurt business, as  Mike Tyson said, in his early heyday in the 80s, when he was slaying everybody.  So the way to go out is to go the way out of dignity.  Win, lose, or draw.  You went out swinging.  You went out fighting.  Every red-blooded American loved that.  They loved that.  They crave off that.  That's what we're made of.  You know, never quit.  Never give up.  I mean, the Yankees is under pressure right now.  Okay?  I'm a Philly fan guy, and I live in Philly.  But at the end of the day, they have to win today. 
[02:10:30]  If they don't win today, it's a wrap.  What happens in Philly that the fucking, what tough fighters they put out?  No kidding, man.  I mean, there was Liston, there was yourself, there was Frazier, Meldrick Taylor.  Meldrick Taylor, Georgie Benton in the 50s and the 60s.  I mean, you had so many great fighters come through Philadelphia.  Welterweights, you had come from Philadelphia.  You mentioned Meldrick Taylor.  A lot of people, even from New York, that's listening, people can know, the older guys 
[02:11:00]  can know that, you know, a lot of New Yorkers came to Philadelphia.  Fighters and promoters and managers came to Philadelphia to get the best barn.  Philadelphia was known as a tough, you know, a little bit of New York, but, you know, Philly  got their own thing like New York.  Larry Holmes.  You guys claim Larry Holmes.  Larry Holmes.  But Eastern Pennsylvania, anything with PA, anything with PA in it, they want to be affiliated  with what?  Philadelphia.  Yeah.  Eastern Pennsylvania doesn't scare your opponent.  Okay?  Stratton Pennsylvania doesn't scare your opponent. 
[02:11:30]  Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, don't scare you.  But Philadelphia.  Forget it.  That guy can fight.  He's a tough son of a, you know what?  And guess what?  We got respect all over Europe.  So you know we got it here.  What do you think of, as a boxer, mixed martial arts, which has become so popular,  and Tony fought, James Tony fought Couture, which, you know.  It wasn't even competitive.  I mean, Couture is, first of all, I respect Couture.  I met him in L.A. a lot.  He's an old school guy, just like me.  And he's 47 or 47. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, he got me by a couple.  But, you know, I wasn't really turned on to the UFC, the MMA, but I watched a guy in  my gym fight, and he also got a fight coming up soon.  And I'm a fan now.  And I can go on air and say that.  I'm a fan now because, you know what, at the end of the day,  no matter who hates, I hate, or whoever, they are athletes in their own way.  They got their own skills.  I couldn't do what they do.  I would get my ass kicked if I go in.  And Bernard Hopkins is saying that, y'all, the executioner, because I'm out of my element.  Well, you're in the ring, Bernard.  No, no, no.  Yeah, I am in the ring. 
[02:12:30]  I know where I'm at.  But it's a different arena.  But in the same token, they train to do what they do.  So you have to take their hat off.  And let me tell you something.  I got on board about, I'd say, about five, six months ago.  I go on record.  I have been on record.  I respect those guys because I've seen the way they train.  It took for a guy to be in Philadelphia Gym.  Right now, as we speak today, I watched him train.  I watched him spar with fighters.  And I watched him learn the boxing, the boxing. 
[02:13:00]  And I watched his coach, who I'm a friend of, teach him the other stuff.  And they add both together, his boxing and his martial arts.  So I respect the training, the fighting, and what they do.  When you step in there, as James Toney did, and as everybody witnessed, or whoever watched the fight, he had no chance.  No chance.  Now, you take that same MMA, UFC guy, and put him in my arena, where he can't have takedowns. 
[02:13:30]  He can now have this or that.  But he would be out of his element.  So they have to get the respect.  And I'm giving that respect, whether they need it or not, that they are bona fide athletes.  And they need to be respected, just like football, basketball, boxing, hockey, or any other sport.  Yeah, it's almost like Anderson Silva wants to fight.  He's a guy that wants to actually box.  But most guys in the UFC, I think, are smart enough to not just go toe-to-toe with a boxer.  That's why no one would have done it.  That's why no one would have done it. 
[02:14:00]  I mean, you hear boxers calling out UFC guys, but you don't hear UFC guys calling out boxers.  And you know what?  That goes to tell you the intelligence that they got to know they lame.  They know they lame.  So, I mean, it's not like, trust me, none of those guys are scared.  I mean, we know they're not afraid to be in the ring.  That guy's getting busted upside the head with an elbow, kicked, you know, in the groin or whatever, even though things are legal and things are fair.  But I know these guys ain't scared to fight a boxer.  It's just they understand that a lot of their attributes won't be displayed. 
[02:14:30]  It wouldn't be the smartest thing for them.  It wouldn't be.  They know that.  They got to leave their weapons at home.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah.  It's like when you're boxing, see a man like myself, I occasionally hit the heavy bag.  You sure do, Jim.  I sure do.  You wouldn't last a minute.  I'm looking at you right now and it looks hard to see you.  But I'm looking at you right now.  The bag will knock you out.  The bag will have arms.  What are you talking about?  Are you kidding these people early in the morning?  They ain't had a coffee and you're talking about used to box?  Look at it.  No, I ain't boxed.  He's a mess. 
[02:15:00]  You leave a Bernard Hopkins hanging truck.  If you keep doing it, you're going to be sleeping.  Yeah, Bernard's trying to high-five Danny.  I'm trying to high-five and I had him up there like I was saying hi.  I'm fine.  I'm still busy laughing at him.  I'm rough in this position.  Oh, but he does hit the heavy bag there.  Oh, yeah.  I wasn't trying to imply that I boxed.  Show him your muscle.  Show him your bicep.  Now, the muscles don't go.  Show him the bicep.  That's why, you know, there's no need for men to compete.  I know my lane.  Let's see.  As Bernard said.  Bernard, would you like to see his bicep?  Show him the bicep.  I want to see the bicep.  Come on.  Show him the bicep.  I don't have a bicep.  I have a boot. 
[02:15:30]  All right.  All right.  Let's go.  Let's see.  All right.  That's my bicep.  I never see a guy show me his bicep and a bump pop up on his shoulder.  I mean, listen.  I hope everybody is up here in New York because this is something.  You don't need your coffee.  Just listen.  Just continue to listen.  Oh, my God.  Just a man like myself who maybe my workout regimen is not quite what.  Right.  Right.  I'm sure you need to step it up a little bit.  I give you some tips.  I ain't going to be too hard on fans. 
[02:16:00]  I give you some tips before I leave because I've never seen a guy squeeze his arm to pop  up a muscle and something pop up in his back.  Literally.  Seriously.  His shirt popping up.  You think he pulled his back muscles or something?  He pulled his back muscles, his shoulder muscles, whatever.  That's the wrong muscle you're supposed to use.  That muscle is supposed to come out of your arm, not your back.  Well, I figure I put everything into it.  Sometimes things happen.  Bernard, you're a funny guy, man.  Yes, Bernard's great.  Really funny fucking guy.  I hit the bag.  But December 18th in Quebec, Canada, the executioner will show up. 
[02:16:30]  Trust me.  He's sitting there waiting, and he's waiting to do his job.  He normally don't say anything.  He comes in to take care of his business and he'll leave, like the executioner do.  We got two months before the fight, so.  Yes.  So you're still in the middle of training, obviously.  I'm just finishing up preseason.  So what do you do now?  Does it preseason, and then you get really?  Yep.  It's to get the.  What's preseason all about?  Preseason is to make sure all the mechanics is done right.  Right.  What kind of workouts for preseason?  Well, we call it, okay, start the engine.  All right.  We start the engine.  That means we do some wind sprints.  Okay.  We check the oil.  That means you see if your eyes are good. 
[02:17:00]  You know, the speed bag.  You know, the swivel ball.  They got all kinds of instruments in the gym where you can check A, B, C, D.  All the way down, you can check these things.  Then we have, without even getting in the ring, boxing yet.  I haven't even threw punches since the Roy Jones fight in the ring with a smart partner.  The bag, as you mentioned, he hit the bag.  I've been hitting the bag for power.  Bag is only for power, not for speed.  That's why I sit there like a dummy, and it gets hit.  Now, speed bag, it has a rhythm. 
[02:17:30]  You create the rhythm.  The rhythm is called timing.  The timing brings eye coordination and reflexes.  Okay?  That's why you hit it with both hands, not one.  The swivel ball.  The swivel ball is a speed bag, but with two rubber bands from the top and a rubber band from the bottom to the floor to the ceiling.  And that's a ball that can knock you out if you don't move your head once you hit it.  Because it's coming like this.  It's coming like this.  It's coming like that.  That thing is a pain in the ass to try to hit.  And guess what?  It's almost impossible.  I've been doing it 23 years, and guess what?  I get hit every damn time I hit it.  Oh, really? 
[02:18:00]  Okay.  Yes.  So I don't feel bad.  As far as everything else, it's basically ground floor work.  Shadow boxing.  Okay?  Stretching.  Working on certain points, certain jabs.  Visualizing somebody in front of you when there's nobody.  That's why they call it shadow boxing.  You shadowing with yourself, but you've got to create an image in your head.  It takes a mentality.  It takes experience.  And then you gradually, which would be this week for me,  because I've been doing this for two and a half weeks now, preseason.  Now we're going into what? 
[02:18:30]  The training.  The teaching.  And Brother Nazeem, who's been with me over 13 years,  will start laying out the blueprint on how to systematically dissect  and take this guy apart and use his youth as a negative to him.  He's a young guy.  He's a confident guy.  But.  Not smart.  Young is not smart.  I got you.  So you use kind of his inexperience against him. 
[02:19:00]  Young people are reckless by nature.  What kind of time in the gym?  A couple hours maybe?  Four hours.  Four hours a day?  Four hours.  Yeah.  I heard 20 minutes a day.  Yeah, 20 minutes a day.  Three and a half to four hours, because I do like multiple things.  And I have three or four spa partners.  My job is to run the first three out there the first quarter of the week.  And if I can get one out of there, two out of there,  I know we're on the right path, because we bring another fresh body in,  and we go a live body, and we go in there and we train. 
[02:19:30]  How do you not lose so much weight if you're working out so hard?  It's the way you work out.  I'm doing court.  I'm doing court work.  I don't lift weights.  And the things I do is different every day.  That's a great question, because you can burn out.  You can sort of disintegrate.  What I do is I have something Monday that they give me.  I don't ask for them to give me what I want to do.  They surprise me.  And normally I know what the surprise is going to be,  but some days the money is different than Tuesday. 
[02:20:00]  They can't trick me.  I've been doing it too long.  But they normally come up and see you boxing today.  And I'm like, I said, we're going to boxing yesterday.  That's what I mean by that.  They're trying to see.  No, Nazeem plays with your head to try to see, okay,  you didn't know you was going to box today because I told you you wasn't,  but you are.  Now, can your mind click back in there?  If you're going, oh, you know, I ain't really supposed to do this today.  I'm going to go through the motions.  You understand the mental game?  Right now it's 99% mental.  At this stage of my career.  Like you said, I mean, who wouldn't, you think I haven't seen Pascal style before? 
[02:20:30]  Of course.  I've been around the game too long.  You think I don't know how to get in shape?  Bernard, you walk around in shape.  That's the book on you for 20 years.  Okay, well, I know how to do that.  Bernard, are you mentally, physically ready for it?  There's always a chance of a breach, and that's why you've got to check that swagger.  You've got to check that ego.  You've got to check all that stuff to make sure that it's right,  and that's what Nazeem is great at. 
[02:21:00]  With me, it's 99% mental.  Everything else, I do for a lifestyle.  I like to look good in my clothes.  I like for people to say, man, he's 45 years old.  Look at him.  Look at his face.  No cuts.  He's talking well.  To me, I get excited by that.  I don't get an erection, but I get excited.  Oh, I hope not.  So you don't eat cheesecake?  Yeah.  No cheesecake for you?  I eat cheesecake as a celebration.  I don't eat cheesecake.  I love cheesecake, man. 
[02:21:30]  I love all kinds.  I like the fancy stuff.  See, the plain cheesecake, the traditional.  Okay, it's good.  There's nothing else around.  Oh, but that cheesecake with the...  What about the pumpkin cheesecake?  I love the pumpkin cheesecake.  I knew you would.  I was going to have some of that recently, and I decided against it.  How could you not love the pumpkin cheesecake?  I love...  No, you got to stay in shape.  Even though they're not one of your sponsors, but it's this restaurant.  I forgot the name, but they sell a lot of different flavors, and I like to go there,  and I say, give me the pumpkin.  I get like three or four slices.  There you go.  Jimmy eats three or four slices, right, Jimmy? 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  I don't drink wine.  I don't drink.  Occasionally, non-occasionally, I don't care what the celebration is.  It's just something I don't do.  Give me cranberry juice or water.  Everybody knows that's my style, no matter where I go.  But at the end of the day, I'm human.  I want a piece of cheesecake and relax.  If that's my only, if you want to call it, like, you know, blinch, then come on.  A little cheesecake.  Yeah, cheesecake is one of...  I mean, it's hard to not eat cheesecake or get a prostitute.  I mean, I take it one step farther.  I also eat cheesecake.  You probably get a prostitute quicker.  Yeah, it's less devastating effects on me. 
[02:22:30]  I think...  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Well, are they pulling out?  Yeah, I think we've got to wrap up, because he's got a lot going on today.  They said we have you to 850.  I don't know.  Is that...  Yeah, she's looking at her watch out there.  Because I'm not leaving unless we're done.  We love talking to you.  I want to talk...  No problem, man.  I love the prison stories and everything.  There's the prison, politics, and then let's go.  McNabb.  Michael Vick.  I mean, we didn't even go...  We didn't even hit the hot spots, man.  I love the Michael Vick.  I mean, I hit the hot spots before I came here, and I can't hit the hot spots now.  Michael Vick, do you think...  I didn't have a chance to take a damn shower, so I hit the hot spots. 
[02:23:00]  When we come here, we don't need to hit the hot spots.  Well, I wanted to, but he...  All right, Michael Vick, what?  Michael Vick, what?  Michael Vick, what?  Do you think that...  Like, he's back in football now.  Should all be forgotten?  Or do you think what he did was kind of...  Because I have kind of mixed feelings.  Like, a guy should be able to do what he wants, but I like animals, so I kind of feel like...  I have three animals, but at the end of the day, man, listen.  I mean, I'm probably a little biased.  I am a little biased.  I met the guy.  I talked to him.  He's in Philadelphia, but at the end of the day, man, listen.  If we all look at what we are under, and that's of forgiveness and redemption and all this stuff. 
[02:23:30]  Listen, no matter what situation it is, certain things that I'm going to tell you as a human being,  that I can't forgive child molesters.  I can't forgive people who take advantage of older people and kids and babies.  I mean, certain things...  I mean, I can go on and on about certain topics I want to pick out, and someone will say,  well, Bernard, that's not right.  Wrong is right.  Wrong is wrong. 
[02:24:00]  Wrong is wrong.  Right is right.  But at the end of the day, he has a life to redeem himself and time for right now to redeem himself.  And I think for right now, and I can't speak for next year or six months from now or whatever,  right now he's doing that.  He's doing a lot of things in Philadelphia and probably other places.  But I know Philadelphia because I'm like the ambassador of Philadelphia.  And I see the things, and he's done some things with me to go out and educate people about dogfighting.  That's a big thing. 
[02:24:30]  Not making no excuse.  That's a huge thing in inner city, man.  And I'm not making it.  Whether it's right or wrong, it definitely is wrong.  But I never got into it because I love dogs.  I love animals.  I couldn't sit there and watch two dogs main each other.  But at the same time, I think that we give him an opportunity because I've been given an opportunity.  I did five years in the penitentiary, and I was told I'd be dead by 18.  I told I would be dead or a bummer and this and that.  And you know what?  I believed that, and I wanted to live up to what they justifiably should have said to me 
[02:25:00]  because that's the way my behavior was.  But something happened to me in my mind, and something made me, and I know what it was, say to myself,  I'm going to prove them wrong.  Twenty-three-plus years later, not only did I walk off nine years of parole without a parking ticket,  but I became one of the forces in boxing history, as they say.  And I also became a businessman of respect in boxing, which is unheard of of boxers to be. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, we know about my partner Oscar De La Hoya.  We know about Ray Leonard, Sugar Ray that is.  We know about certain spots of fighters in certain times who've done well.  But it's more who haven't done well.  It's more who showed a different side that stereotyped all boxers in so many ways.  I'm great that I had that opportunity to redeem myself.  And I think he should get that chance.  What got to you, though, that made you turn your life around? 
[02:26:00]  Like, was there an incident?  I just got tired, man.  It wasn't because you got the first year and a half.  Was it something that happened in prison?  No, listen, the first year and a half, man, I was just like all the inmates, running around, you know, praying on a prey,  like I did in the city.  In Philly, it was like I was getting the guys on the streets that was just as bad as I was.  They told the cops on me instead of taking care of themselves.  Thank God.  I've been stabbed three times.  Jesus.  I got my wounds to show it.  But at the end of the day, I don't, like I said to people, I said, jail, and I want to, you know, let people understand. 
[02:26:30]  Jail didn't change me.  What changed me is because when I went to jail, they had cable.  They had certain things.  And, again, I know a lot of inmates, if they listen, they probably say, well, what do you mean?  Why are you trying to take that cable?  What I'm trying to say is things I didn't have in the streets that I had there.  And I said, wait, this kid, this ain't that bad.  You got more stuff in prison than you had out on the street.  We've talked about that.  All my friends.  Y'all talked about this? 
[02:27:00]  A little bit, yeah.  When I got there, I see more friends there than I had in the streets.  So it was like, to me, it was like, wait a minute.  But then, like I said, we click, and I'm going to ask that question.  I know we got to get out of here.  Sure.  Is that I started boxing in the gym.  They had a boxing gym in Greater Fort State Penitentiary.  It's a world document.  You can Google my name.  Our guy, archives is up in there.  And I got back into the gym, and I just got tired of being locked up.  I seen guys who was there for 15 years, 20 years, saying they don't want to go home.  They will either beat up a guard, beat up an inmate, so they can get a, what they call a hit. 
[02:27:30]  A hit is they're going to get another, they get more time.  I'm like, why these people don't want to leave?  If I didn't, even though my body was locked up, but my mind wasn't.  And you reverse that.  You could be locked up mentally and be in society, but won't do nothing to produce what's good for you and your family.  And you could be mentally incarcerated and physically incarcerated if you're in.  Now, I wanted to be out, but I wanted to be out, not only mine, mental, but also on my body. 
[02:28:00]  And I told people that I'm going to stay, and I'm also going to become the middleweight champion in the world.  And it took some time for me to achieve that, but I never gave up.  That's the movie.  That's the book.  That is the inspiration.  Right on.  Well, they're definitely telling us we've got to get you out of here.  The fight is December 18th.  December 18th, it's, of course, the great Bernard Hopkins against Pascal.  Oh, it's on Showtime.  Showtime.  Free.

You take a plastic bag, you cover the battery up so you won't get no rust or no kind of bacterial poison from the battery.

He's going to forget about us.  As soon as CNN gets a hold of him, it's over.  It's over, John.  Yeah, it's over for our country. 
[02:33:30]  I want to thank Bernard Hopkins for stopping by.  He's a great guy to listen to.  Very, very interesting.  I was telling him.  I saw Gary.  It's like all those Philly guys, like Keith is a comedian.  They're just fucking funny, ball-busting guys.  They're all funny dudes, man.  Those guys from Philadelphia.  They're all tough guys.  What's that about?  Freh that motherfucker.  They're just funny guys.  They've got tough neighborhoods everywhere.  But Philly, man, some personalities come out of the ghetto.  Yeah, there is some.  Will Smith came out of the ghetto in Philly.  Let's not forget.  Yeah. 
[02:34:00]  And we all know how great he is.  I wish you would have talked.  I wish you would have had Bernard for longer.  Because I forgot how much he loves talking about politics.  We should have talked more about that stuff.  Next time.  Yeah.  I mean, he'll be back when the fight's closer.  The fight's a little too far away to get excited about.  Yeah, he might, though.  But I was asking his guy.  They said he does some phoners and stuff.  But he might not do a lot of in-video press.  Oh, I see.  Because he's going to be totally focused.  Maybe we'll get him after the fight, then.  We were talking, too.  Ope was noticing, too.  Because Bernard sat.  I couldn't get the picture.  Oh, my God.  I was trying to get one. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, you were, too?  I was trying to get a picture.  I was distracted for half the interview, because Bernard Hopkins, I noticed, was holding Jimmy's  arm very...  And sitting so close to him.  Extremely close talker.  Extremely close talker.  And he had his hand wrapped around Jimmy's arm.  Every so often, he'd grab over and grab Jimmy's forearm and just hold it as he's talking.  And I was sitting there going, that looks real uncomfortable.  No, but it really wasn't.  I was thinking to myself, in prison right now, I would have to react violently to this. 
[02:35:00]  Otherwise, I would be...  Oh, you would be sucking his dick in no time.  It wasn't uncomfortable.  It made you feel like you were back in Mommy's womb, though.  It was comforting, right, Jimmy?  It was like, nobody was going to bother me.  My pal.  But it wasn't...  It was weird.  It was like...  It wasn't...  It wasn't uncomfortable.  It wasn't...  Let's be honest.  It wasn't gay.  No, of course not.  No, but it was...  And he wasn't pulling a dominant male thing on you, either.  No, it was just...  He was leaning over like, hey, here's the story.  He's a gentle monster.  He was being nice.  He really was.  It's like, you can immediately pick up on someone's vibe like that. 
[02:35:30]  Now, obviously, he wasn't gay.  He's fucking...  Danny left him hanging, though, man.  That high-five was up in the air for so long.  I didn't see him.  We were all getting uncomfortable.  I turned my head.  It was so uncomfortable.  I had to say it.  I had to say it.  You couldn't leave him.  Yeah.  He had a great line.  He turned for some action.  And Danny was, you know, you're busy doing your thing.  And all of a sudden, he's just standing there with his hand in the air.  His hand up.  That would have turned into a fist that just busted Danny in the face.  But it was funny.  He said something. 
[02:36:00]  He's like, yeah, I was getting guys that were like me.  Like, he was picking on tough dudes.  You could tell that he was a fucking...  That's a guy you didn't want to come across.  No.  Trouble.  When he said he got stabbed and he has the wounds to show it, I was like, we got to see him now.  But I wasn't brave enough to ask for that.  Fuck that.  You could probably see him when he fights.  I mean, I'm sure when he fights, you could see him.  Oh, another bed bug story.  That's just terrific.  Unless he got stabbed in the ass or something.  Enough with the B-roll on the bed bugs.  Yeah, they love that bed bug B-roll. 
[02:36:30]  Hopkins fucking rules.  I'm so happy.  I want to talk about the prison stuff a little more, too.  Yeah.  What is that?  The hell is that?  Is that a full-grown bed bug?  Is that a woman?  What?  Is it a woman or a bed...  Oh, that ugly thing?  Oh, God.  You see the close-up.  It's absolutely horrific.  She looks like the old lady from Poltergeist if she was melded with a tumor.  Yes.  Oh, she's...  It's Gail Brewer.  Look at her.  She looks like she survived progeria.  It's fucking...  It's big A as a woman. 
[02:37:00]  Progeria.  Oh, wow.  Oh, she's terrible.  She's a New York councilwoman, I guess.  Oh, look at the bed bug trying to walk.  Well, it's an epidemic in New York.  We all have bed bugs.  Do we?  I think every person must do that in the city.  I don't even want to fucking see one.  The same clip every fucking new show.  I know.  It's that B-roll.  Listen, I'm going to say into...  Well, bed bugs, bed in.  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Ian Halpern started his bed in yesterday.  Wow, she's rough looking. 
[02:37:30]  And no one gave a shite.  That's not true.  That's not true, Anthony.  Sorry.  Why would you give it away right off the bat like that?  What are you, crazy?  I thought, but that's just...  This is a big media event that has happened with Ian Halpern.  I meant no one in this room.  Oh, okay.  Good call.  No, that's not entirely true, either.  I know the press was, like, all over it, and that's a very good family.  It was a big event, Anthony.  So what's the setup?  Ian Halpern came in to promote his Governator book that it seems like no one's buying for  some reason.  And Ian Halpern knows how to write a good book.  Arnold's people are trying to cover up that this book is even coming out. 
[02:38:00]  So do you think that's hampering sales?  Has the book come out yet, officially?  Yes, it is in stores.  Word, hampering?  Put a damper on?  Hampering.  Hampering.  Yeah.  It's where you put your dirty clothes.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I think our last guest has taken my vocabulary away.  But he...  I was going to say, and I was too scared, I'll be honest, that he has a lot of things to  accomplish by the end of the day.  I know we all use that, but he used that one a lot. 
[02:38:30]  By the end of the day.  You've got a lot of things you've got to get through before the end of the day, sir.  By the end of the day, some people have a crutch.  It moved up to 35,454th place.  Wow.  Look what his appearance did on our show yesterday.  That fucko.  Very impressive.  And that's with Arnold's people trying to silence him.  Oh, I know.  So with that in mind, he decided he's going to do a huge media event here in New York City,  just like John and Yoko did.  A little bed in in a hotel with media from around the world.  Yeah.  And the reason he wants the governator to become the president someday, but he can't 
[02:39:00]  be because he wasn't born in America.  He wants the Constitution to be amended.  Correctamundo.  And he wants that to get done by him staying in bed.  In the bed.  That's right.  A lot of work gets done there, right?  Maybe sleeping work.  So what happened after the show yesterday, Sam?  Well, I was there for the start of the bed in.  Oh.  Which was nice because, as he said, he had designed it to be an Opie and Anthony exclusive. 
[02:39:30]  We get the first scoop.  Which we should, yeah.  And that explained why it was just me, Ian, and fleas.  Yeah, yeah, because that was your exclusive interview part before the press makes a frenzy  of it.  Right.  You know, we're still dealing with his nonsense and we're not even on his website.  Oh, my God.  And he mentions Howard.  I'm on the website.  Oh, damn.  Ian.  All the great shows he's on.  Well, I'm on the front page.  I'm not arguing.  He hasn't mentioned Opie and Anthony?  No. 
[02:40:00]  That's a little weird.  I think it just hasn't been updated because he also doesn't mention the Today Show.  Well, how about you update the website?  Because we're the ones, like, you know, dealing with the nonsense.  Yeah.  It is silliness.  A lot of silliness.  We had to deal with his friend Fleece or Fleas, whatever the fuck his name is yesterday.  What a weird guy.  I loved him.  Right.  Yeah, but he's weird.  So, Sam, you know, we went off the air.  So what happened after we went off the air and...  Well, I went down for some obviously reporting.  Wait, wait.  Did he write that O&A show was rocked by the governator on Amazon and he spelt it B-Y? 
[02:40:30]  Yeah, that's his...  He's an author.  The first sentence is rough, too.  He's an author.  O&A show was rocked.  Yeah.  O&A show was rocked.  I think he has Bobo write his tweets for him.  B-Y, the governator on Amazon, and Amazon isn't capitalized, but...  Oh, wow.  He really...  He's a fucking author?  Yeah.  That is like a Bobo fucking...  Yeah.  ...tweet.  Yeah.  Go to his website, though.  You'll see.  You know, come on.  Come on.  Come on.  There's IanUndercover.com. 
[02:41:00]  That's his website, huh?  Undercover.  Is that the bed-in?  Is that Troy?  Yeah, I'll get to that.  I'll get to that.  All right.  I'll get to it.  All right.  What's going on?  I'll get to it.  All right.  What the fuck, dude?  I'll get to it.  That was Troy naked.  I'll get to it, I said.  All right.  Walk us through.  The show's over.  We run for our cars to get the fuck out of here. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  It's like a Le Mans start.  I was asking if you guys maybe wanted to come down to check out the bed-in, and all I got  was some dust kicked up off your shoes.  So I went down there, and...  All you got was what?  Dust kicked up off their shoes.  Into your face?  That's not really good.  Because you were running.  Could have used something else.  Like what?  I don't know.  See?  I didn't have time to think about it.  Yeah, that's just it.  I'm not...  Maybe I shouldn't have brought it up at all. 
[02:42:00]  Maybe you shouldn't have said it.  Yeah, we weren't digging that one, Sam.  Dust off my shoe.  That's a little rough.  Are my shoes dusty?  No, you have nice shoes.  I shouldn't have said it.  Yeah.  What the fuck are you saying?  You live and learn, I guess.  But anyway, I went to the hotel, and...  What hotel?  The Warwick.  The Warwick.  Yeah.  I can't give his room number.  Why?  He'll have a Beatles situation?  Yes.  Exactly.  Because it's already full of media, so...  You know, the Justin Bieber situation, I'll update that.  That's the joke I use over and over again.  Just change it to Justin Bieber. 
[02:42:30]  It'll work for another year.  All right.  Let's go, Sam.  And he decided, I guess, to start the bed in once I got there.  Yeah?  Because he...  First, he was going to get in the bed, and then he said,  Wait, wait, wait.  This will look better.  And he stripped out of his clothes.  In front of you?  Yeah.  Now, completely?  He has a chest tattoo?  No, that's Troy.  Troy, yeah.  Oh, wow.  What?  That's Troy.  He stripped down to his boxer briefs.  His white boxer briefs.  Ah, okay.  Did he see his helmet?  I didn't look.  I was made to feel uncomfortable. 
[02:43:00]  You're a journalist.  You probably should have assessed the whole situation.  I was pretending to read texts.  Oh, okay.  Was it just you and him in the room?  No, and fleas.  Well...  So I didn't know what kind of weird shenanigans they had in mind.  You were about to be raped.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  They wanted you so bad.  I was trying to come off as professional.  Well, did you have to fight with the rest of the media to get this exclusive?  Where were they?  Outside the room at this point?  Well, before I went down, Travis and I called the hotel front desk.  Yeah. 
[02:43:30]  And said, where is the media going, and what room should we be heading towards for the  Ian Halperin bed-in?  And unfortunately, the front desk had no idea what we were talking about.  Yeah.  What?  No clue.  Not a clue.  But if you're going to have a bed in the hotel, you've got to set it up with everybody  ahead of time.  I guess this was more guerrilla marketing than anything else.  Without the guerrilla.  Well.  And the marketing.  Because he didn't realize, or the hotel didn't realize that he was doing it at all.  So I had to email him and get his room number. 
[02:44:00]  Shouldn't the hotel have been alerted, though, if there's going to be so much media?  They need room in front of the place for all the boom trucks and things like that?  You'd think so, but as luck would have it, it was just me with a handy cam and a voice  recorder.  Ah.  So far.  So far.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just for the start, as I said, the L.P. and Anthony exclusive.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  None of this made the papers or anything yet.  Yet.  When are they going to write their stories on the big bed-in?  They'll probably be tomorrow's headlines.  So you had to email him to get his room number. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, I'd basically...  The hotel obviously not going to give you the room number.  I just emailed him and said, what's your room number?  And he gave it to me.  And I just went out.  It was just a hotel room.  Was it at least a good hotel room?  It was small.  Could you see the door from the bed?  Oh, yes.  All right.  Problem.  Oh, yeah.  It's the lobby from the bed.  And also, Fleas was in there?  Yeah.  Literally?  No, no, no.  The guy.  Oh, okay.  I thought there was another.  And there was just the one bed. 
[02:45:00]  One bed.  And that isn't even like a big king.  That's like a queen-sized bed.  It's a queen-sized bed.  Yeah, it looks like a queen, all right.  Yeah, it certainly does.  I don't know what Fleas was doing overnight.  Oh.  And there was just the one bed.  There's no shenanigans if he's doing a bed-in where he's staying awake all night there, Sam.  That's right.  Yeah.  If he's staying awake all night.  So you go in the room.  Yeah.  He opens the door, nude.  Nude, and then what happened?  No, he wasn't nude.  He stripped in front of me.  He stripped in front of me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry that I made that mistake.  He got nude.  Yes. 
[02:45:30]  Does he have a fit body?  Is he physically fit?  No.  Does he have any?  Not really.  No, he's not at all.  Does he have any markings on his body that you'll be able to...  Identify?  Yeah, identify in a lawsuit.  In a court of law, where you'll be able to point out a scar or a birthmark?  Does he have any spots on his penis?  I didn't see a good penis.  Does he have a freckle on his helmet?  I don't know.  Anything that might help.  Then you're stupid.  I can't help you when the lawsuit comes around.  But he is very tanned. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  From head to toe, from what I saw.  Head to toe?  From what I saw.  So he likes to tan in the nude?  Oh, he's tanning.  Or boxer briefs.  Maybe spray on.  Yeah, maybe a little spray on.  All right, so now he's nude in bed with you.  Then what happened?  Yeah, and then I started my interview.  Wait, you were nude too?  No, I didn't get in bed.  I said you and him were nude in bed.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  He stripped.  No, no, no, no, no.  He stripped and got in bed.  And I stood next to the bed.  To start the big bedding.  Like, was your dick at mouth level?  I know the scene.  Ian was laying on his right side suckling Sam and jerking himself off under his awful white boxer briefs. 
[02:46:30]  Is that what happened, Sam?  There was no sexuality involved.  No.  Yet.  Did you collect any DNA for the lawsuit?  No, there's no lawsuit.  He's just reporting.  Don't wash your clothes from yesterday.  Yeah.  Okay.  That's a mistake a lot of the women do.  Don't wash your clothes.  It should be in an evidence bag already.  That's right.  I wasn't raped.  What?  We don't know that, Sam.  Well, you know what?  It's called denial.  Oh.  And eventually you'll come around and realize.  Let's take a look at your hiney hole. 
[02:47:00]  Make sure it's okay.  You can't look at that.  How's your coolie hole?  It's just fine.  You sure?  The place where the cocky comes out?  No, it goes in.  Thank God.  All right.  So now, all right.  He's nude in bed and you've decided to start the really awkward interview.  You were on the bed, by the way.  I saw a picture of you laying on the bed.  That was later.  And so he talked you into getting in bed with him.  You're in bed with him right there in that photo that you tweeted yesterday. 
[02:47:30]  Not Sam on Twitter.  At the end, I got in the bed over the covers, clothed, just for a publicity shot.  You're leaning in very close to him.  You're actually shoulders.  Your shoulders are touching.  But I'm making a face like, oh, uh-oh, this is uncomfortable for me.  Did he have bad breath?  Because obviously you're close enough to know.  I wasn't close enough while he was talking to know.  And what hotel have you ever gone into where you need his sunglasses?  He wears the sunglasses.  Yeah, he put his sunglasses on.  He had the American flag hanging.  Oh, yeah, his naked leg is hanging out of the sheets. 
[02:48:00]  And why an American flag?  He's Canadian.  He thought he was Hunter S. Thompson.  I don't know.  That's exactly what he's trying to do, by the way.  Very good.  All right, we got audio.  Do we lead to the audio now?  Yeah, so the first clip is my first attempt at trying to get to the bottom of...  To his bottom?  No, not trying to get to his bottom.  Oh, I heard different.  I'm sorry.  Trying to get to some information.  There's more funny word mixed up on this show than three's company.  I tripped on that, but we all got it. 
[02:48:30]  Yes, we did.  There's more funny word mix ups.  All right, let's...  But you know what?  Three's company, they always have one.  Like Mr. Furley went over here, Jack saying,  Hey, Larry, shove that helmet thing in my asshole.  And Mr. Furley would think it was gay.  And then it would turn out to be something completely not gay.  Something heterosexual, like one of fucking Suzanne Somers tits.  All right, here's the first clip.  So we're here with His Highness Hollywood, Ian Halperin.  What are you doing here?  Well, this is exclusive to the opening Anthony show, 
[02:49:00]  which I think is the best radio show on the planet.  Because no one else called him that.  And I'm doing a bed-in.  I want the Constitution changed.  So I find it racist, discriminatory, anachronistic,  and I really want them to change the Constitution  so foreigners can run to become president.  It's all my book called The Governator.  I'm here doing the bed-in.  This is the first book bed-in ever.  When did the bed-in start?  It just started about 15 minutes ago. 
[02:49:30]  So we're the first on the scene.  Yeah, Opie and Anthony gets the first exclusive  because I'm indebted to that show.  I love the show.  And there's a lot of other media coming later,  but the whole plan is to give it to Opie and Anthony first.  And this is what I'm going to be doing for 48 hours.  No food.  There's going to be a lot of women coming through  over the next 48 hours,  some of them giving me massages,  hopping into bed with me.  So if any hot chicks are watching this,  please just drop me a line at twitter.com forward slash Ian Undercover. 
[02:50:00]  When are these women supposed to be here?  Because so far, it's just me and you.  Yeah, well, we're just starting slowly,  but the first one should be here in about 15, 20 minutes.  And then I've invited all the hookers of New York to come by.  I will feed them.  I'm not allowed to eat.  It's a 48-hour fast.  But the whole thing is to raise awareness.  This is like the John and Yoko version,  the bed-in for peace.  Well, I'm doing the bed-in to change the Constitution. 
[02:50:30]  Change the Constitution.  We'd all love to see the plan.  Yeah, yeah.  What's the plan other than...  Punch up a pic.  What's the plan other than sleeping in bed?  Like, is he going to approach politicians?  No.  What's he doing?  He's just lying in the bed.  That's it.  But nothing's happening, and there's no people around.  Like John and Yoko had kind of a little party going on.  A journalist from around the world. 
[02:51:00]  After I did that, and I videoed it, too.  You could hear the echo, because no one else is in his room.  No one's in there.  I videoed it, too.  And as I was leaving, he told me in all seriousness,  he said, no, seriously, just so you know,  just for your own information, it's not even to toot my own horn,  but you should really hold on to that footage,  because some of the bed-in footage of, like,  Yoko and John that's original goes for millions now.  Oh, really?  That's what he told me.  Yeah.  If you ever looked at a picture of John and Yoko doing their bed-in, 
[02:51:30]  I think the entire time they're surrounded by press.  Yeah.  Like, there are photographers there.  You can't even see John and Yoko at one point.  Yeah, yeah.  There's like, yeah, look, see, press is there.  Grow your hair for peace.  Yeah.  And there's, you know, and when they first started it,  the bed was surrounded by all kinds of press.  Not just me knocking on a hotel room door,  and not sure what was going on on the other side.  Yeah, yeah.  Just wondering if you're going to get raped.  Yeah, I was going to say, 
[02:52:00]  you were wondering if there were going to be some shenanigans.  I thought it was all fun.  Was there a few moves?  It was all fun, right?  And then when I got to the hotel  and I walked in front of the hotel room door,  I realized, like, oh, this is like a real thing now.  Like, this is a guy in his hotel room,  and it's just going to be me.  That is the same thought that, like, Tyson,  the bitch that went up to see Tyson in his room.  Vandersloot.  Vandersloot.  And what happened?  Who was that up in Colorado?  Kobe Bryant.  Kobe, yeah.  Kobe. 
[02:52:30]  These are what all those girls thought,  when they were like, wait a minute,  I'm just walking into a hotel room with this guy.  And I go, okay, well, he's a professional.  He does shows and stuff.  He knows what he's doing.  And so I walked in there, and he's like, okay, yeah, let's do this.  And all of a sudden, he started taking his clothes off  while I was standing, like, two feet away from him.  Before you know it, that girl was getting fucked in the ass over a chair.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm just going, oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.  Yeah.  That's why I kept...  You were saying, oh, shit, so that way it's clear for his cock?  No.  No?  Because that's not what I would have wanted. 
[02:53:00]  I would have wanted to empty his bowels, Jimmy.  I understood it.  I don't disagree.  We might have to check your coolie hole.  No, it's fine.  We have a responsibility.  Where the poo-poo comes out.  We have a responsibility to Bobby.  We do.  We have a responsibility to your mother.  She saw the picture, and she talked to me about it last night.  So if she were really worried, she checked it.  Did you drink anything in the room?  No.  Oh, shit, did you?  I didn't drink anything.  I didn't eat anything.  Are you sure you were conscious the whole time?  I was conscious the whole time.  You didn't drink the time, nothing.  Kept it brief.  As a matter of fact, that's all I got for my first visit. 
[02:53:30]  I was out of there.  Oh, you left?  I left.  How long was the first visit?  10, 15 minutes.  There was more than one visit?  That means you were kind of into this a little bit.  No, I had to get to the bottom of things.  I had to report for the show.  It means you couldn't help yourself.  You had to go back.  Well, because he said...  He just drew you back.  He said there were girls coming.  There were reporters coming.  So I knew...  Oh, you thought you'd hang out and wait for these people that weren't coming.  He did say first interview and the rest of the media were coming.  So you took a break.  How many hours did you break? 
[02:54:00]  Four hours.  I went back there at like 3.30 in the afternoon.  Four hours later, you went back.  Yeah, and I made Troy go with me because I needed some backup.  You were a little scared.  And the media?  How much media at that point four hours later?  Four hours later, I went in there and it was then it was...  There was one other person because Troy came with me.  So then that was it.  It was just me and Troy.  So still no media.  Yeah.  Just the opening after the show and a naked Ian.  Ian nude in his bed with his laptop.  And now it was more uncomfortable because he insisted, as you saw in the picture. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah.  I think you posted it at ianundercover.com.  His leg was sticking out of the covers the whole time.  He insisted on keeping his right leg nude on full display.  I don't know.  He was hoping Sam was a leg man.  Just his covers draped over his genitals.  All right.  And you got this audio.  Sam returns to his highness who is still alone in bed, possibly nude.  We're back with his highness.  It's been four hours since we left. 
[02:55:00]  How's it been going?  I'm not getting hungry.  I'm getting a bit horny.  So I'm waiting for a couple of massage.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  He's making all the moves, Sam.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  That is so fucking wrong, man.  It was creepy.  He sounds like Bruce Mittman, too.  Oh, boy.  I'm nude.  Let's take your clothes off.  He's naked in a hotel room bed with white sheets covering him.  And the first thing he does is tell me he's gotten horny over the last four hours. 
[02:55:30]  Tell Ozo to bring some pot pie.  It's the way you make people feel.  Horny?  Yes, you do.  I'm getting a bit horny.  So I'm waiting for a couple of massage therapists to show up.  But, yeah, we just had a camera crew here from Reuters doing some online interviews.  So it's heating up, you know.  Wait, let me correct you.  It was Reuters, R-L-I-D-E-R-S.  The whole time I was there, his guy kept saying, hey, Ian, did you check to see if the Reuters article went up? 
[02:56:00]  Did you check yet?  Did you check yet?  The Reuters article, that was almost 24 hours ago.  This Reuters article has not yet surfaced.  No, maybe it takes a while to edit.  Maybe it takes some time.  And it never will.  You don't think so?  No.  Hopefully, by the end of this, I'll be able to get the Constitution changed and also be able to sell a lot of books.  You sound a little more subdued now than you did earlier this morning.  Is it wearing on you, the whole lying in the bed thing?  Not really.  I like lying in bed, but I don't like lying in bed alone. 
[02:56:30]  So I'm just waiting for the chicks to show up.  Once the chicks show up, it's going to be much more stimulating.  And you're doing this interview lying in bed with him?  No, I was standing.  When did you get in bed with the nudie in Talpern?  That's after.  After you were nude with him?  No, I was never nude.  I kept my clothes on the whole time.  He was nude.  Which made one of us, Troy.  Troy went all the way nude?  Anyway, keep going with the clips.  Oh, my God, what is going on? 
[02:57:00]  Oh, boy.  Troy got weird.  Troy got weird, huh?  Troy got really weird.  You're saving it.  Yeah, that's the end.  Troy's a weird guy.  Troy got weird.  I mean, I just brought him to videotape, kind of be the silent, you know, helper, producer.  And he jumped right into the story.  Look at him.  We'll get to it.  Okay, we will.  He jumped in asshole first.  He got weird.  We'll get to it.  No chicks have showed up yet, but one is on her way.  Yeah.  As the interview four hours later continues.  Four hours later.  You said earlier that there would be some chicks. 
[02:57:30]  Has there not been any chicks yet?  One of them just called.  It's a very hot chick.  Her name's Amber.  She's on her way from D.C.  Ah.  So she should be here shortly.  He said there'd be chicks in 15, 20 minutes.  Does she have anything to do with the government being from D.C.?  Maybe you can get your cause, you know.  Actually, she does.  That's why I asked her to come in.  And she actually works in government, and a story that I've always wanted to do is how  horny a lot of the chicks are inside the White House. 
[02:58:00]  So with my undercover connections, it's going to get interesting when she shows up, because  she's smoking hot.  And you're going to try to get to the bottom of how horny people in the White House get?  Well, yeah, I'll get to the bottom of it.  Literally to the bottom.  This reminds me of Archie Bunker's place.  Oh, God.  Like when you're watching it, you're like, what are you talking about?  What are you talking about?  What are you doing?  What's happening?  Archie Bunker's place.  Yeah, this isn't...  That might be his next project, an expose about how horny the women of Washington is. 
[02:58:30]  Yes.  What happened to his book, The Governator?  Do you think that's a good expose?  I think it has legs.  I do.  Yeah.  It has potential?  Yeah, especially if the word horny is in the title.  Yes.  Horny.  Horny.  Horny.  An expose that's going to shock the nation.  Yeah.  The women of Washington are very horny.  All right, Sam, where are we at at this point?  So I'm still...  It's approaching 4 o'clock in the afternoon. 
[02:59:00]  He supposedly started this bed in at like 11.15.  He's saying, no food, no getting out of bed, no nothing.  Right.  And so I'm standing next to him.  And I'm probing him as he is new.  Of course you're probing him.  No, no, no, no, no.  Probing him with questions.  He's been there the whole time.  Oh, God.  Of course you were probing him.  That's the back part.  Probing him with questions, metaphorically speaking.  I'll tell you one thing.  Like, right when...  If you guys see that, when I'm with Amber, I'm sure Mr. Anthony, I mean, he'll get his 
[02:59:30]  rocks off.  Anthony's with Amber Alert.  He just brought up Anthony.  I don't know why.  Yeah, out of nowhere.  He is obsessed with me.  That's not what I've heard.  Really?  I've heard the opposite is true.  He'll get his rocks off watching this because...  Do you think Anthony would jerk off to you and Amber?  Yeah, I think Anthony probably...  Seriously, I love Anthony, but I think he goes home at night and plays the replay of my  tapes on your show.  So, and while he has chicks over at his pad, I'm sure in the background he's not listening 
[03:00:00]  to Dean Martin or Tony Bennett.  I mean, he's listening to His Highness on the O&A show.  And what is the fantasy?  Because you said he's got girls, so it's not a gay thing.  Is it sort of like...  No, I just think that my voice, he prefers it to music.  And he knows when he brings a chick over, the best way to get the chick to go the full  nine yards is to play in the background.  His Highness on the O&A show.  Yeah, that'll do it.  Because that's what goes down when there's chicks around you.  Absolutely. 
[03:00:30]  I mean, look, he lives vicariously through me.  Anthony does.  Absolutely.  There's no doubt about it.  I love that because...  That's so good.  I was like smiling and said, Anthony does.  And he looked at me straight-faced and I could see him almost scowling through his  glasses saying, absolutely.  Absolutely.  Yes, that's a fact.  He vicariously lives through His Highness Hollywood, Ian Halperin.  Ian.  Anthony vicariously lives through Gerbils.  When do we get to the Troy part?  After the interview.  I know.  After the interview.  We have to get to the Ian Halperin bed-in information. 
[03:01:00]  All right.  Good news.  The next clip is where he offers you a spot in his bed nude.  Yes.  Yes, it is.  Why are you choosing to do this bed-in without clothes on?  I mean, there's interviewers like myself coming over.  I don't understand the nude approach.  Well, you know, hopefully one of the interviewers will be a hot chick and decide to jump in the  sack and get first-hand undercover experience.  You know, I like to walk around naked.  Okay.  You know, I live on the beach. 
[03:01:30]  Ah.  So, and when I walk the beach, I just wear a thong.  So, a thong.  Oh, my God.  What a sight.  Oh, my God.  Has that got to be a fucking disaster?  He's not in thong shape.  No, he's not.  No, he's not in thong shape.  No.  Not many guys can pull that off.  Not really.  Yeah.  He's got a proportional, a sizable torso.  Sizable torso.  Yes.  Okay.  At the beach, I just wear a thong. 
[03:02:00]  A thong?  Yeah.  Wow.  So, let's say this chick, Amber, doesn't show up for whatever reason, and by tomorrow,  there's still no girls that have showed up at all.  If I got into bed with you, would that be close enough?  Well, it would be a bit too close, because, you know, I'm not into men.  I know you're hot with the ladies, too.  Yeah, that's true.  There's no doubt about it.  It's the hair.  As soon as they see the hair, they want to put their fingers all through it.  But, no, I mean, the bottom line is, hop in bed, but don't get too close. 
[03:02:30]  Okay.  And, you know, definitely there's going to be chicks here.  I've definitely had some requests.  Well, I'll probably wait for that, then, before I hop in.  Housekeeping.  It's the only chicks that are going to be coming in there.  So, now, he said hop in bed with him.  No chicks inside.  Is Fleece, or Fleece, what is his name?  Fleece.  Fleece.  Is he in the room at this point?  Yeah, is he just sitting on a chair watching?  That's all he's doing?  That's all he's doing.  Oh, what a creep.  The whole bed, and he's just sitting on a chair watching. 
[03:03:00]  That is really just a creepy scene.  And it's just me.  I'm the only medium.  And this wasn't near, like, a luxury hotel kind of a thing, was it?  It was just kind of a...  A tiny room.  A tiny room.  And it was just a square.  There's a walking room on either side of the bed.  Like, can't Ian just get a suite?  No, no suite.  Why?  There's room for, like, luggage on either side of the bed.  You can walk in front of the bed.  Yeah.  And then there's the door.  I mean, it's nothing.  Right.  A little bathroom.  I've been in those rooms.  Don't worry, Sam. 
[03:03:30]  I have been with the common man.  I've known what those rooms are like.  It's tiny.  Not in those rooms with the common man, like you were.  I was.  But...  To interview.  Yeah.  Right.  Well, let's hear when you guys get all naked.  When are you going to the bathroom?  Because if you're stuck in bed, where, even?  No, I'm not going to go to the bathroom.  I know how to hold it in.  For 48 hours?  Absolutely, man.  I have nothing coming in my body.  When nothing comes in the body, nothing comes out. 
[03:04:00]  I got you.  But hopefully your body will be going into someone else's body.  Well, yeah, hopefully not.  But even if I've got to go to the can, I'm going to make this very organic.  I'm going to do it the Moroccan way.  I'm not using toilet paper.  I don't even know what he's talking about anymore.  What's wrong with him?  I don't know.  Come on.  He's talking about shitting the bed.  Yeah.  All right.  The Moroccan way.  Unfortunately, the last clip of the big interview.  Yeah.  And then we get into the Troy situation.  Yeah.  Because Troy was videotaping this whole thing. 
[03:04:30]  He was my assistant.  Nice.  Now, in fact, one of the chicks coming, I won't say her name, but she's Bruce Willis' ex-girlfriend.  Wow.  And she has a gorgeous body.  The tits are mediocre because she had them done.  They feel real.  It's just when you suck on them, you know it's not the real deal.  I see.  So when is she coming?  Because that's when I'd like to be here.  Because so far, it's been empty rooms.  Yeah.  So far, it's just Fleas here who's making sure I don't eat. 
[03:05:00]  I never got an answer as to when Bruce Willis' ex-girlfriend was coming.  And did you talk to him this morning?  No, not yet.  Are you going back there for the...  You want me to?  Oh.  You don't want to put me in a dangerous position.  I could really go bad.  Yeah, it could.  Yeah, give me more audio.  Yeah.  Exactly.  The recorder could work.  So then I was packing up.  And I was thinking about getting a picture for Twitter. 
[03:05:30]  And I was like, nah, I'm not going to bother with it.  And Troy puts down the video camera.  And he goes, hey, Ian, is it cool if we get a pic?  Can I get in bed with you?  Oh.  And Ian goes, yeah, sure you can.  Yeah.  Come on in.  And then Troy goes, is it cool if I take my clothes off?  Is it cool?  And he goes, yeah, I guess.  And he goes, yeah, it's cool.  Yeah, because I want to do that.  And Ian goes, yeah, sure, do it.  And we were all kind of trying to figure out what was happening. 
[03:06:00]  And then Troy started taking his clothes off.  Yeah.  And then he goes, Ian, is it cool?  Can I take my underwear off, too?  Can I just take my cock out?  No, we didn't.  I swear to God, that's the word he said.  Can I just take my cock out?  He said, can I take my underwear off, too?  Can I just take my cock out?  Uh-huh.  And Ian said, no.  Oh, Ian said, no.  He goes, no, I mean, don't take the cock out.  Just leave the underwear on.  And Troy goes, are you sure?  Because I'll take, I mean, I just want to take the underwear off.  And Ian goes, no, just leave the underwear on. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  And that's when Troy got in the bed with him.  I wasn't filming.  I wasn't videoing.  I wasn't doing audio recording.  Uh-huh.  Nothing.  And Troy got under the covers.  He picked the covers up.  He slid right in under, as close to Ian as he could get, and said, all right, let's take  this picture, I mean, he wanted to take his cock out, but he didn't.  He didn't.  He really wanted to.  Oh, okay.  I think he wanted Sam to see it.  Yeah.  As a show of who's the boss.  Yes, yes.  Where's Troy?  He's in there.  He's kind of hoping you didn't ask for him. 
[03:07:00]  His cock is clogging up the entire room over there.  This is, it got weird.  And then Troy was in his boxer briefs.  Oh, here he's sashaying.  Yes, here he comes.  Jesus.  Well.  Troy.  Troy, all right.  You got involved, I see, in the bed end.  I was just there to have a good time.  Yeah.  You know?  It's weird, man.  It's weird.  It got weird.  Well, you know.  It got a little weird, Troy.  We walked in.  First of all, there's silence when we're in the hallway.  You know, you'd think there'd be something going on.  A buzz.  A buzz, yeah.  Oh, right.  Some kind of commotion. 
[03:07:30]  He opens the door.  It stinks like alcohol.  And it's just those two guys.  And there's no radio on.  There's no TV.  It's just this weird silence.  Yeah, there wasn't no music on.  Like, there was nothing to break up the fact that it was just one man nude in bed and one  man.  With the sunglasses on.  It was like NPR.  Yeah.  Except he was nude and in bed.  What was Fleas doing?  He was just, I told you, he was sitting.  But was he reading a book?  No.  Reading the paper?  He was sitting in the chair next to the bed watching. 
[03:08:00]  He was just looking at the bed.  Watching for what?  Watching the interview happen.  Watching Troy take his clothes off.  But what was he doing when you guys arrived?  Sitting.  He opened the door.  Braiding his arm hair.  He's got a lot of arm hair.  I mean, and Ian was just typing on the computer.  So it looked like Fleas was just sitting in the chair watching Ian.  Watching his master.  All right, Troy, what else?  So the room stunk of alcohol.  So it stunk.  So Sam did that.  And then I just wanted a funny picture for my Twitter. 
[03:08:30]  But you got under the covers with no pants on.  Well, yeah.  You didn't need your cock out.  You did ask.  Because I did.  I wasn't bluffing.  It was such an uncomfortable room.  I just wanted to take it.  I wanted to elevate it to the next level.  To the next level of being nude in bed.  And I started.  I was like, you know, can I take my underwear off?  Do you mind if I take my cock out?  And he said.  He said.  Do you mind if I take my cock out?  It got weird.  He's trying to explain it like it's a normal thing.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just not normal.  He said that to me while we taped the boneyard, too. 
[03:09:00]  I always say yes.  So just having fun.  You know, it was a good time.  I guess you're not shy as far as your cock goes.  No, whatever.  You have tattoos all around us?  No, no.  I have tattoos on my legs, but none on my cock.  Yeah.  So what's the tattoo on your chest?  It's a sacred heart with crown of thorns with wings.  It's a big piece right across your chest.  It's a dopey.  Wow.  It's a big piece right across your chest. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah, that's good.  So what else can you say about the bed end?  It's just bizarre.  Or why did you want to get naked in bed?  I just thought it was funny.  I mean.  To bring it to the next level.  It makes sense.  I get the picture thing, but all you had to do was take your shirt off because you had  the covers on up to your waist.  Well, like I said, it was just such a weird vibe in there that.  Sometimes to make it weirder, it eliminates all the other weirdness.  Now there's only one.  Oh, uh-oh.  Now there's only one weird thing.  But the weird. 
[03:10:00]  No, it was all still weird.  Sorry.  Those headlines are just grabbers, aren't they?  Apparently there's a chimpanzee loose somewhere.  And I just thought it was funny.  The cops were chasing him.  The cops were chasing him down the street.  It's not on the loose right there.  It was.  It was a chimpanzee loose.  Oh, I'm looking at the wrong set.  Oh, yeah.  No, it's the one below that, Jimmy. 
[03:10:30]  It's just never not funny to me.  Troy, you're not going to whip your cock out in here.  It just gets a little weird.  Although he does.  He goes the extra mile for the show, Sam.  You're not asking to whip your cock out.  Rub it on Mars.  I didn't see you.  You saw you fucking like it was a blizzard, the way you were bundled up.  I just had a shirt and pants on.  Blizzard.  Yeah, no, I wasn't willing to take my penis out for Ian Halperin because I am a serious journalist. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, but there was a weird vibe.  And the way to fix that is by taking your cock out.  Troy told us all.  Sure.  I wasn't there to fix the weird vibe.  I was there to report on it.  Troy, I guess, wanted to.  Oh, and Ian also wanted to take.  Is that Troy's comics or somebody else's?  I don't know what that is.  No, it's someone else's.  It's called Troy Comics, but it's just like a whole bunch of gay guys in a pool somewhere.  Gay guys in a pool.  I think it's a girl.  I see one girl.  Yeah, with another girl.  Like another girl.  That's the Archie's. 
[03:11:30]  Troycomics.com.  Yeah, I put in gay Troy and it was the first thing about it.  See in the background, Mr. Lodge is a teabagging Jughead.  Troy, how far would you have gone to get the weirdness out of the room, by the way?  Moose is deep ticking.  Oh, Archie.  Archie or Reggie.  Reggie.  I just wanted to see what happened.  He wanted a picture of us both looking at each other.  Yeah.  So that was a little weird.  Yeah, but we're done that.  That's the weird part.  No, we did it.  Yeah, you did.  It's on his camera. 
[03:12:00]  See, I would say that if Ian started giving Troy like a hand release, some kind of hand  release under the covers, I think Troy would have kept going with it to see how weird it  got.  Would you?  Well, I mean, if it's funny, sure.  It's not gay if it's funny.  Yeah, exactly.  You would let him jerk you off under the covers?  I probably couldn't get an erection.  Right.  I'll bet you could.  I don't know.  I mean, maybe.  I don't know.  How many times have we done funny or gay on this show?  And that is funny.  Yeah.  What?  Is it funny? 
[03:12:30]  Oh, wait.  Sorry.  Fuck.  No, the gays.  Fuck.  No, no.  Wow.  It is funny, but you just have to chuckle as your cum is bubbling over his Canadian fingers.  As your cum is lava dripping over his fucking knuckles.  Lava dripping.  That's great.  Glove.  It's because you've just cum all night.  Yeah.  You can't take the sexual frenzy that's going on.  So your loads are just kind of bleh.  And it's because you're not jerking at someone else's so they don't know how to edge you. 
[03:13:00]  And then when you cum, it's just a thick glob.  It looks like mayo.  It's not even a fucking...  It's a thick...  I don't know how to edge you.  Yeah.  Get it right to the brink.  Yeah, I'm the fucking...  Do that a few times and then let her rip.  Yeah.  It's like whenever I fuck, I don't shoot far a lot of times.  It's just kind of...  It's like my dick just throws up on her ass cheeks.  I don't even clear the crack.  Yeah, it's humiliating. 
[03:13:30]  I don't even clear the crack.  Holy shit.  Goddamn, that's good.  All right, so you would allow him to jerk you off onto the cover if it was funny.  Yeah, if it's funny, sure.  I mean, maybe Troy should go back today on his own.  I don't know.  Just see what happens.  He's checked out and long fucking gone.  He just gave up.  I don't think he's going to sit there for this shit.  There's no one there.  Like, no one's going to show up.  There's no reason for him to be there. 
[03:14:00]  That is true.  All right.  He's back in Canada.  We could call his room.  I think we should.  Should we go real fast?  Oh, God.  10 minutes and 30 seconds it takes.  Yeah.  I think we definitely should then.  There's a big buzz going on about this.  Exactly.  Big to do.  I got a lot of stuff to do.  And then the Yankee game.  Oh, that's right.  You're gone.  Yankee.  What time's the game?  Four o'clock.  They're going to lose.  I know.  I know.  What?  I'm going there to watch the Yankees. 
[03:14:30]  I just got an email from Ian Halperin.  Oh, what does it say?  You want to meet me for lunch?  No.  No.  It's a link.  I'm assuming it's uk.news.yahoo.com.  Oh, no.  Oh, wow.  Oh, UK.  All right.  So apparently there must have been some UK reporters.  Yeah, yeah.  Our own country didn't find it enough newsworthy enough.  Oh, yes.  And somebody did post a video.  Okay.  Of Ian Halperin's bed-in. 
[03:15:00]  Author stage is bed-in so Arnie can be president.  Ian Halperin, author of blah, blah, blah, is lying in bed for two days straight without  eating and he did it.  He did it?  He made the Yahoo UK news.  Author stage is bed-in so Arnie can be president.  I'm looking at what a dick he looks like.  That's hysterical.  Let me play that video.  It's a side shot of Ian with his sunglasses on and he's nude in bed.  And his fucking mushy torso.  A publicity stunt or a shameless publicity stunt in Halperin's stages of 48-hour hunger 
[03:15:30]  strike and bed-in at New York's Warwick Hotel.  And the cause, good and true for the New York Times best-selling author.  Hold on, pause this.  Pause it.  See, now we get the vigil.  There's fleas.  We got the visual of the door opening and the camera crew walking in so you could see  this could be the smallest hotel room ever.  The shittiest hotel room I've ever fucking seen.  Certainly in all of Manhattan.  The door looks like it bumps into the bed when you open it. 
[03:16:00]  Where's the Warwick?  It's on 54th and 6th.  Yeah.  We drive right by it every day.  And that creep fleas is sitting in the chair, which is way too close to the bed.  Dave, but you can't get any further away.  There's not enough room.  There's a window there.  Holy shit.  To be further away, unfortunately and fortunately, he'd have to throw himself out the window.  What floor?  Did they just give the room number on the...  I think they just gave the room number on the video.  I think they did.  Scroll back.  Scroll back.  Look, you can see it on the door.  Really?  Play it.  I'll tell you if it's the right one. 
[03:16:30]  John Halperin's stage is a 48-hour hunger strike and bed-in at New York's Warwick Hotel.  Oh, yeah.  And that's his room.  They put the room number...  They tell the hotel and then they put the room number on the video.  That's it.  So...  2-4-0-3?  Okay.  Well, you said it at the war.  I'm just looking at the video.  Anyone can get it.  Right.  Exactly.  You don't have to check in.  You can just walk in and go up.  That's what we did.  There's no press check-in.  You just go and knock on the door.  And ask to get naked like Troy did.  Yeah, ask to get naked and take a picture with Ian.  The bed-in is becoming... 
[03:17:00]  It's easy.  We want a bunch of people to just take pictures naked with Ian.  We want fucking cock pictures with Ian.  Let's turn this into a photo op and book signing.  Yes.  So I bring you a book.  He'll sign it with his cock.  Let's hit it.  Good one, Jim.  And of course, good and true for the New York Times best-selling author to amend the  U.S. Constitution to allow Arnold Schwarzenegger to be elected president.  You couldn't make it up.  His friends have told me that on his checklist right now is to amend the Constitution and be 
[03:17:30]  able to be president of the United States.  In 1969, John Lennon and Yoko Ono did a bed-in in my hometown, Montreal, and I'm doing  the first book bed-in ever to change the Constitution so that Arnold can run for president.  But with his latest book of Biogavani called The Governator just out and claims he's having  trouble publicizing it, isn't this just a cheap trick to try and sell more copies?  You think?  Mr. Halpern is insisting his motives are pure.  Can you pause right there?  A little odd. 
[03:18:00]  Can I tell you the beauty of this is that Ian's trying to hide his gut by pulling the  sheet up to his nipples?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it's up to his nipples.  Hilarious.  And he's sitting there just signing books because, you know, there's...  Yeah.  Everyone wants their book signed, so he's using the time in bed to sign them all.  Definitely.  The sheet is right up to his nipples because he's hiding his gut.  It's his fucking William Frawley body.  I love that.  Ah, that's great.  Let's continue.  No one ever thought Arnold could be Mr. Olympia.  No one ever thought he'd win Governor of California. 
[03:18:30]  So Arnold has clearly proven whenever people think he's the underdog, he time and again,  he proves them wrong.  And in this case, I believe we will see Arnold Schwarzenegger one day be able to become  President of the United States.  Arnie's term as California Governor ends in January.  The one-time Terminator who told the world he'll be back has yet to announce what he'll  do next. 
[03:19:00]  That's it?  That is classic.  Really?  That it's presented as news.  As a real piece.  In my hometown of Montreal, and I'm first ever book signing, sit-in, book signing.  There's a reason it's the first ever book bed-in, because nobody goes to it.  No one's going to go up to someone's hotel room, unless of course we tell them to take  cock pictures.  Maybe I shouldn't say that.  Oh, wow.  There's a registry for bed bugs.  That's all I'm saying.  Oh, is there? 
[03:19:30]  I don't know.  So I better not read that.  Okay.  Yes, Sam.  Breaking news?  No, I just told them to try to get them on the phone.  Everybody's just sitting there with their thumb up their ass.  Yeah, we got to, I mean, now that this is a legitimate news story, we got to take it  a little more seriously.  Exactly.  We just said the hotel and room number are on the air, so it probably wouldn't be too  hard to get connected to his room if we tried.  That goes for anyone, really.  Sure.  We're just waiting.  Not that you'd want to, not that you'd want to call him this list. 
[03:20:00]  It just doesn't end.  It never ends.  Oh, yeah, the registry.  Danny's got it up.  How does it rate?  Fuck them.  Let's see how it rates.  Yeah, we can find out for ourselves.  Oh, there it is.  Oh, boy.  Don't look at the TV.  Why do they do this?  Do they do that on purpose?  Oh, we got Ian.  Prancing primates?  It's for the...  Ian Opie here. 
[03:20:30]  I want to apologize on behalf of the entire Opie and Anthony show.  We just saw a big video news piece on the computer, and it looks like this thing is  taking very...  It's starting to take off.  It's taking off, and it's a very serious thing you're doing now.  Hold on.  Opie, I want you to say hi to my friend, Amber.  She's so cool.  Oh, you finally got Amber there.  Hello.  Good morning.  Hi, Amber.  How are you?  He always delivers.  What's up, Amber?  I'm good.  Who is this?  Oh, this is Opie and Anthony and Chip.  How are you doing? 
[03:21:00]  And Chip.  I'm Chip Chippison.  She sounds like one we've talked...  Oh, my God.  Hey, what are you...  Are you in bed with Ian right now?  I don't think we have funny names.  I was, but now I'm brushing my teeth.  Sometimes I brush my teeth, but I forget I use a paintbrush.  She likes Chip.  What are you?  Are you the girl from Washington?  No, I'm from Brooklyn.  Well, not originally, but that's what I like to say. 
[03:21:30]  What do you do for a living?  I am a singer-songwriter.  Oh, boy.  So he knows two people named Amber.  He just said that Amber was from D.C. and worked in the government.  Worked in the government, but...  Huh?  You've got another Amber, Ian.  Amber blew it.  Yeah.  Amber?  Amber?  Amber, when asked by people who do you most look like as far as a celebrity, who would  you say?  I hear...  Let's see. 
[03:22:00]  I hear Marissa Tomei, and I hear, occasionally, Ricky Lake.  That is an impossibility.  Well, there was two Ricky Lakes.  Which version?  Yeah, the fat one and the fatter one.  Or the one Susan Smith used to.  And that's when I'm always like, oh, you're going to insult me and tell me that I look like  I know, that's an insult.  Are you a slender gal?  I'm a...  I would say I'm an average gal.  Kind of, you know, average bills.  Oh, that means you do a lot of things in bed. 
[03:22:30]  Do you like the Snapple...  Do you look like the Snapple girl?  Wendy.  You guys are hilarious.  Yes.  I'm half Iranian and half Italian.  Oh, my God.  That hair growing in, like, as we speak.  Yeah.  Right?  Fleece, I run for his money.  Yeah, you have a problem.  Where is Fleece?  Yeah, is Fleece still in the room with you, Amber?  Yeah.  Who?  Fleece.  Fleece, the weird bald guy in the corner.  Yeah, he looks like a screensaver.  No, no, he left.  Why, do you think he left some hidden cameras here or something? 
[03:23:00]  I don't know.  Amber, I got to ask you this.  You have a...  You're a singer-songwriter.  Yes.  Do you have a Facebook or somewhere where we can maybe see you?  Yeah, I do.  All right.  What is it?  I have a website.  Which one do you prefer?  Facebook?  Website will be great.  The phone's ringing, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sure that's not listeners calling.  What?  Yeah, it's www.amber.com.  It's Amber, A-M-B-Y-R, damato, D-A-M-A-T-O.com. 
[03:23:30]  Let's take a look.  Yay.  Yeah, when you pull it up, then...  Wow, you do look like Ricky Lake.  Holy shit.  Holy shit, you really do.  That's crazy.  Ricky Lake with a big nose.  Oh, Jesus.  What?  Oh, wow.  Kramer.  You're going to give me a complex over here.  No, no, no.  No, you're very cute.  Where's that photo?  There is a photo.  You look like the chick from that Greek movie.  What was it called? 
[03:24:00]  My big fat Greek wedding.  My big fat Greek wedding.  Wow, you're as big as Ricky Lake, too.  Oh, whoa.  Wait, wait.  You do have a little heft to you.  You've got a little heft to you.  Let's be honest.  You're a big bone lady.  You're, uh, not, you're, you're, um, Zoftic.  You're Zoftic.  Yeah, exactly.  A little Zoftic.  Whoa, the pictures are getting even bigger as Danny goes through your photos.  I'm very flexible.  You're very pretty.  Fucking Ian's a chubby chaser.  Good boy.  Good boy.  Good boy.  Oh, it's not a chubby chaser. 
[03:24:30]  She's, uh, you know, she's just got, she's got some meat on her bones.  He's very...  And on her plate.  Guys, guys, see...  Look at us working together, Ed.  Isn't it fun?  Ian says I should offer to teach you guys a yoga session.  Oh, well, why does Ian have the sheet pulled up to his titties to cover up when the camera  crew was in there?  Ian went pigging.  Oh, no.  Pigging. 
[03:25:00]  Stop.  That's crazy.  That's crazy.  No, that's very, that's not nice at all.  Uh, by the way, your, your website is really, uh, getting hit hard.  It really is.  Like the buffet table when you're there.  No, it really is.  It's getting, uh, very hard.  You're a pretty girl.  What kind of, what kind of, uh, what kind of music do you sing?  Obviously opera, but what else?  Meatloaf.  Are you, uh...  This is a meatloaf cover band.  But I love you.  No, no, no. 
[03:25:30]  It really is good.  What kind of music do you do?  Um, I would say it's like indie rock.  Kind of like singer-songwriter-y.  I write my own stuff.  So is it folky?  Yeah.  Oh, you want to play something for us?  Yeah.  Ian, Ian, uh, wants, wants you guys to play one of them.  Let's not repeat history.  Don't order the ham sandwich.  I'm a vegetarian.  Ah, what?  I'm going to get that fat-eating fucking leaves.  If you listen close, you can hear cows go...  Did you date... 
[03:26:00]  That's such a bad joke as cows don't listen to this show.  Apparently they do.  Did you, uh...  Ah, what a fat pig.  Fatty.  Did you, uh, date Bruce Willis?  Did I?  Yeah, and they're the listeners of Colton's group.  This is beautiful.  Oh, oh, I forgot they could call me.  We thought it was the media, but you know it's our listeners at this point.  They know how, they figure out everything. 
[03:26:30]  Amber, did you date Bruce Willis?  No, come on.  I'm, like, in my 20s.  Why would I do that?  Aw.  Well, Ian said that some girl that was dating, uh, Bruce Willis is coming to see him as well.  With some fake titties.  With some fake titties that aren't quite right.  Oh, mine are real, but, uh, but, you know, Ian's got a lot of ladies coming to visit him today, I'm sure.  Yeah.  So what time did you get there?  Did you get there today or last night?  Um, let's see.  I don't know.  That's, that's, um, that's kind of a, uh, question. 
[03:27:00]  What do you, what do you do in bed to make up for your fatness?  Oh, wow.  She's not, she's not fat.  No, she's pretty.  She's pretty.  Hey, I'm, I'm looking at her pictures right now on the website.  Hey, it's all good.  It's all good.  It is all good.  Look at that.  Yeah.  If you guys get to meet me in person, I, I could just, I could just.  That's great.  Don't worry about it.  Have fun.  How bad is Ian in the sack?  Have fun.  Is Ian good in the sack?  Yeah.  Is he good in bed? 
[03:27:30]  I don't know the answer to that.  After he takes off the sack.  I don't know that.  You don't, you don't know if he's any good?  I don't know.  Oh, I thought maybe you were.  Oh, really?  How big is Ian's penis?  Yeah.  Does he have a big, uh, penis?  I don't know.  We want to know how big his penis is.  Yeah.  We really want to know.  Troy wants to know.  Yeah.  Troy wants to know.  Yeah.  Forgive the comparison, but is it like an elephant's trunk?  Pardon?  Is it like an elephant's trunk, his penis?  He says it's very large.  Well, if that's what he says.  You know, the thing that wraps around your tail when you're walking in line? 
[03:28:00]  I have to admit, I wish that my wit was a little quicker to keep up with.  Nah, don't worry about it.  That's right.  Metabolism, too.  We can't keep up with one.  What'd you say?  I had one, too.  Metabolism, too.  Fuck, I had one, too.  I was going to say, we can't keep up with her at the buffet table.  I know.  It's very, it's okay.  We stepped over each other.  You're a lovely girl.  You're a lovely girl.  I don't know what to say.  You really do look like Ricky Lake, though.  You do.  You do.  I think you're very pretty girl.  I'd get a nose job, but, you know, that's just me. 
[03:28:30]  Nah, I don't think so.  What?  I think she's fine.  You know, your web page really is, I'm having a lot of trouble logging on here because  our audience is...  Yeah, people are all in your web...  Really.  ...and your Facebook page.  You're going to see the...  I'm glad the listeners aren't calling the room anymore, though, because that'll be distracting  on the air.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yes, Sam.  You getting an update?  Yes.  For the record, via email, Amber was described as naked by Mr. Ian Halperin.  Oh, are you naked, Amber?  No, no, that's the other Amber.  Wait, was that me? 
[03:29:00]  But were you naked earlier when you were in bed with Ian?  Yes.  She says, cool, I have a hot chick here now.  Very hot, comma, naked.  Oh!  That's you, Amber.  Amber, you were naked.  Nice.  I feel like you guys are on the radio.  He's writing via email.  How does anybody know if they're telling the truth?  Yeah, but where are you?  Let us know, where are you?  Because that's kind of hot.  Ian, Opie and Anthony want to talk to you.  Oh!  Oh, no, no, we don't.  Room service must have just got there. 
[03:29:30]  You know, all the media's calling.  All the phones are ringing.  They're off.  Yeah, those phones are ringing, all right.  What are some of the media outlets?  Suckadick.com.  What is it, Ian?  Who's calling Ramon here in the back?  Yes, Chip.  Chip calling.  Chip must be calling.  The phone's ringing.  The phone's ringing off the hook.  There's nothing bigger in the Apple today.  Nah, this is the huge story, man.  This is the huge story.  Ian, could you get Amber to sing maybe? 
[03:30:00]  It's bigger than the mosque.  It is.  Yes, it is.  Well, I want to congratulate you, though.  We just saw like a UK piece that's on the internet there.  Which gave away your room number.  Which gave away your room number.  Yeah, yeah.  Nothing to do with what's happening right now.  Well, that's how Amber found me.  Yeah.  Ah.  You want Amber to sing a little song for us?  Yeah, let's hear her.  Hold on.  I'll pass it.  Yeah, let her sing.  Hold on a second.  Uh-oh.  I'm ready for it.  I'm ready for some more.  No, no.  No abuse.  No abuse.  You're a singer-songwriter, right?  Yes. 
[03:30:30]  Do you have your guitar with you?  No, I don't.  I was doing a show in D.C.  Look, do you sing anything a cappella?  Because this is a good spot for you.  We can't play your songs right now.  But, I mean, you're on the phone.  Maybe you can do like an a cappella thing.  I would like just a few lines.  I love a good singer, and I would like to hear your voice.  Even a cappella.  Just a little something for us.  What do you think?  Do you guys have like a favorite song or something?  Oh, yeah.  No, you know what?  I think her favorite song.  Just pick one.  What song would you like to sing, Amber?  Yeah, some our listeners might know. 
[03:31:00]  Someone left a cake out in the rain, maybe?  What would you sing?  I usually sing me and Bobby McGee at karaoke.  That's a great one.  Oh, my God.  Anthony's mom likes that song, too.  She loves that song.  She loves that song.  One of our favorites.  You want to set her up?  Yeah.  It's Amber singing Bobby McGee.  At the bed-in.  The Ian Halpern bed-in.  At the Ian Halpern bed-in.  For the Governator book.  At what hotel?  As the listeners continue to call this room. 
[03:31:30]  At what hotel?  The Warwick.  At the Warwick?  What room?  24-05.  No, no, no.  24-03.  24-03.  24-03.  24-03.  At the Warwick.  Oh, no.  And here she goes.  Bobby McGee, ladies and gentlemen.  Let's hear it.  I think everyone who's speaking on the radio should know.  When you hear it, it's just nonsense.  When you hear it, it's just nonsense.  When you hear it, it's just nonsense.  When you hear it, it's just nonsense.  When you hear it, it's just nonsense.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  The O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[03:32:00]  On the Virus Sirius XM.  Hey, except a random social network friend request from a tan, bikini-clad hottie named Angie.  And you're really befriending Boris, a pasty criminal, cyber criminal, who's about to get buddy-buddy with your online savings account. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah, you can keep going.  Leaving you penniless with that empty, true friends shouldn't treat each other like that feeling.  Can you believe it?  She was still singing.  I put the headphones on to do this lovely read.  And she was singing.  She hadn't a clue.  True friends, they don't treat each other that way.  Cyber criminals, they're everywhere, everywhere.

You're listening to the worst of the O.P. and Anthony show.  Now, on the virus, Sirius XM.  Now we say hi to an old friend.  He's been calling our show, but first time in studio.  And we think like two years.  It's Jay Moore, everyone.  Jay Moore!  Come on!  Got a live audience out there. 
[03:34:00]  Give them a little something something.  Yeah.  Friday's the day.  I love the bleachers.  Jay, you should have came here Friday.  There's over 100 people every Friday.  It's like Rascals in Ocean Township in the winter.  I don't know.  Something about now, O.P.'s been on Twitter for a while.  I just entered the world of fucking Twitter last night.  I don't like the Twitter.  What do you think is so interesting?  How many people are into your Twitter?  How many people do that?  Thousands, right?  Really?  Yeah, I'm doing all right.  I'm up to 17,000 or so. 
[03:34:30]  No, he's off the grid.  He's off the grid.  He decided to go off the grid.  I'm slowly going off the grid, baby.  He's pulling everything.  Really?  Yeah.  It's not a bad thing.  It might be good for people working, but if I can get a job, I'll go completely off the  grid.  You don't Facebook or any of that stuff?  You're not at Helium this weekend?  No.  No.  You don't Facebook or anything, Jay?  He doesn't need to, though.  Well, if he says Jay Moore, he can come if they come.  Yeah.  It's like how Nipsey Russell used to do it.  That's why I just canceled the Lysner Auditorium in D.C. 
[03:35:00]  Oh, shit.  Jim Jefferies canceled it, too.  Really?  Yeah.  Why would nobody fucking buy his tickets?  No one has money right now.  Fuck that.  They got tickets.  I thought entertainment was...  Why am I shouting, first of all?  Yeah.  You're yelling.  Patrice eating a big fucking thing of watermelon?  Way to break a stereotype, you fucking moose.  I figure I sound just like Jimmy as I sit here.  Fucking chewing on his fork.  He likes watermelon.  I don't know why.  What do you do?  You should make fun of his pimp hat.  Black man chumming to eat watermelon. 
[03:35:30]  You should make fun of his booze.  It's a nice hat.  I like his hat.  When do you have to get it back to Clyde Frazier?  It's a nice hat.  Nothing on Clyde Frazier.  I laughed.  I like the Clyde Frazier.  I know.  You liked it.  He was swishing and dishing on his way into the studio this morning.  Enough with the big words.  I just need a little play-by-play and a little color commentary.  I love him.  I have penetrating and percolating.  It's going good.  Picked up?  We got a full season pick up.  Yeah.  Now you got to sit around and wait for the second season.  You want to come on?  What do you mean?  We could use a colored.  I thought you had one. 
[03:36:00]  Holy shit.  No.  Don't you have like a fucking third world guy on there?  Something that has to be mixed.  A third album.  I think I watched it a few times.  It's like your kid's third world something for CBS to fucking have on there.  I think one of your kids is kind of black, like some half black kid or something.  The kid that plays my son looks exactly like Andre Ethier from the Dodgers, which no one in  the studio audience will get.  Kenny, that coffee's delicious.  Can I get you anything?  Coming right up.  Let me unlock the toilet for Opie first. 
[03:36:30]  And then I'll get your coffee and stir it with my nose.  Dude, they guard that stupid bathroom.  What's going to happen?  I'm an angelfish.  You are getting successfully plumped too, my friend.  No, I'm actually slimming down.  I got huge for the movie Street Kings.  What, did you gain weight for a movie?  Oh, yeah.  Are you Robert De Niro motherfucking?  I was right out of my face.  Get over yourself, nigga.  They told me to.  They told you to get fat for a movie?  No, I wasn't fat.  I was yoked, dude.  I was big. 
[03:37:00]  You were doing a Raging Bull thing?  What, like muscles?  Oh, you were jacked.  Oh, jacked for Street Kings?  Yeah, because I had to be the guy that like Keanu Reeves and Hugh Laurie and Forrest Whitaker  were afraid of.  But you was only in it for like...  Yeah, that's why I'm doing fucking television, because you don't get cut out of it, stupid.  There's an entire scene...  I saw Street Kings.  I'm like, Jay Moore is in Street Kings?  He got buffed full of fucking special guest Jay Moore?  I got buffed for the script.  For an under five?  Did you get...  You ain't lying. 
[03:37:30]  He got muscles for an under five?  It was true.  For a little more time on the big screen.  It was all in the script.  You know, there's an entire scene where I'm talking to Keanu Reeves in the bodega,  when he...  Forrest Whitaker...  You saw it, right?  Yeah, yeah, I saw it.  Forrest Whitaker's like, maybe when I come back in here, maybe this tape will be missing.  Maybe.  I protect you.  I only do black eyes.  I saw it in that movie, too, with that bad eye.  I am chewing up this scene. 
[03:38:00]  I could not be more proud of my men.  I only do black eyes now.  I'm chicks.  That was fucking great.  And there's an entire, like, three-minute scene where me and Keanu Reeves are going back  and forth, like, we're almost going to fight, and the whole scene, you just see my left  ear and Keanu's gorgeous little face.  And I went, that's it, get me a show.  Why would they do that to somebody and have them adjust what they look like in a movie that  they're not sure you're going to fucking be in enough to look good? 
[03:38:30]  I don't know, Patrice, but you're making me feel good.  What a nigga?  Let me tell you something.  I love when black guys call me nigger.  Fucking.  Yesterday, I was coming, I was walking down 55th Street, and some guy goes, oh, that's  my nigger.  Oh, shit, what's that nigger's name?  Jay.  I just kept walking.  Has never not worked.  Like, I've been in the game a long time.  Jay is all, since I met him, Jay's been one of those dudes that just never didn't have  a job.  Never went away.  Coffee, please.  Never. 
[03:39:00]  Hey, Kenny, where's this coffee?  How long are you going to wait?  It's like charcoal already.  In a minute.  What the fuck is this?  It's fucking, don't you guys have coffee here?  Uh, you'd think.  She's not able to function without this coffee.  I can function, but now it's like a matter of principle.  I want my fucking coffee.  You don't want the coffee we make here.  Why is it non-delewish?  Here you go, you're asked.  Oh, you went to Starbucks?  Just for you.  Freshly shaven, Kenny.  Yes.  I'm the best for you.  You're the best, honey.  The best one about Kenny.  Kenny, he looks like an Accela train. 
[03:39:30]  That's the best one that came in.  Accela train, yeah.  That's the best one that's coming in.  When Jimmy's in L.A., whose car do you pull around?  I think it was, my favorite Kenny is actually, I think it was Jay's line where he said he  looked like an angelfish.  Oh, yeah.  He said it right.  Yeah, an angelfish.  Don't you?  Yeah, he said it all he is.  Oh, that was like an angelfish.  That was yours?  Yeah.  I called you from the set of Ghost Whisperer, and I put Jennifer Love Hewitt on the phone  with you, and I said he looked like an angelfish.  Yeah, all right.  Because we use that one all the time.  Some of these things get blurred. 
[03:40:00]  You don't remember where it came from.  Huh?  Still married?  Oh, yeah.  Who you married to?  Somebody famous, right?  Ananda Lewis.  Who you married to, Jay?  Nikki Cox.  You really didn't know that?  What the fuck?  Give me a break, Richard.  It's a biggie.  Nigga.  I know, I know, uh...  You know enough about white people.  You don't...  Yeah.  That's okay.  Nikki, give me a break.  That's fallen into a whole new category.  I know he was married to someone famous.  Someone that had a name.  How many kids you got?  None.  I was trying to get my girl pregnant, just to see if I could. 
[03:40:30]  I'm trying to get her pregnant.  And she's getting...  Her breasts are getting...  So you might have done it?  This is big news.  But she could be on a period.  Oh.  But I think...  She's been trying to throw herself down the stairs.  Well, if she's on a period, then she's not pregnant.  She doesn't want to have one?  Nah, she hasn't.  I thought she would want one.  She came with you.  She would, but...  Just to see if you could do it, and then she's just going to fucking throw herself down the stairs.  But I've never came inside of a woman.  I'm going to tell you, if I found that out when I was younger, I'd have eight kids.  I'd be Sean Kemp if I found out how fucking good coming inside a vagina. 
[03:41:00]  It's just...  You never fucking...  Always...  Always porno stuff on your face, titties, stomach.  Never.  You never just left it in and fucking buried it deep and...  Oh, fuck that.  Recently.  Holy shit.  And it's so much stress.  It's addicting.  No shit!  That's why this planet's crawling with humans.  It's fantastic.  Oh, it's just...  I'm trying to have kids now.  Yeah?  So, like, I would never waste one. 
[03:41:30]  You're constantly just creaming.  Right inside.  Cream pieing.  They go, come on my tits.  And you go, no.  No.  I won't.  No.  I won't.  I won't.  I sound like the gay guy on, uh, Mean Streets.  Would you tell him to calm down?  I won't.  And you have no kids.  I have a six-year-old from a previous disaster.  My son was born two months premature because he couldn't wait to get away from that cunt either.  Hey, how about the Friday fight song, guys? 
[03:42:00]  The kid is...  Your son is now six.  That was fast.  Wow, that's fucked up.  Six, one, two, twenty.  Who could win in a fight, you or Tracy Morgan?  I don't know.  You'd kill him.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Tracy's from Brooklyn.  What's that mean?  So was Riddick Bowe.  He's in jail.  I don't know.  So he'd fight dirty is what he's saying, right?  I wouldn't even...  I don't have no clue.  Where are you from?  I'm from Boston.  Boston, that's right.  Yeah.  You know within...  That's what we meant.  The second someone got hurt, it would just end in gunfire.  It's just the way it works.  I have no clue.  But there's no comic that I think of that I go, there's one, uh, like, like, Corey Holcomb looks 
[03:42:30]  like he can fight.  Yeah.  Joe Rogan.  Rogan.  Rogan can kick ass.  But if I didn't know Rogan was a dangerous human being...  You wouldn't think he...  I'd go for Rogan, but...  Oh, man.  Would that be a mistake?  Wait a minute, but I know he's dangerous.  Yeah, yeah.  If I didn't know he was dangerous, who I'd go, well, I don't know if I'd fuck with him.  There's not many comments you go, oh, man.  You get a little nervous physically.  Rogan's a guy, if he had a...  If I had a bat in my hand and he said, come on, I would lay the bat down and walk away. 
[03:43:00]  So we're talking because we know this motherfucker's a dangerous weapon.  I'm talking about looking at him.  I don't know if we're looking at him.  He looks scary.  Well, he's all roided out.  Looks like me and Street Kings.  Is he bigger now?  He's a big boy.  I just already know that that fucker can fight.  Remember Mitch Mullaney?  Rest his soul, he died.  The guy from Oakland, Nick Freno, licensed teacher.  Yeah, Mitch Mullaney.  We were in a fight with this guy, this Harbor Heights Mexican Mafia guy in the Laugh Factory. 
[03:43:30]  This guy got crazy and just started fighting everybody.  And it was like me.  Like, Tony Rock ran inside the second the fight broke out.  His breath fought, though.  But there's a story about Tony tagging a couple of motherfuckers up in L.A.  Tony's boxing people up.  Alonzo Bowden looks like he might be in a fucking fight.  I was at a fight where Tony Rock ran inside and held my jacket.  This one.  Ralphie May was fighting.  Jamie Masada was fighting and Tony Rock ran inside. 
[03:44:00]  Really?  Because this guy was, like, whacked out on PCP and he had all the tats and stuff.  And it got broken up.  And then him and his friends were trying to get him out of the little foyer.  And then as they were pulling him out, you know, me and Mr. Big Mouth, I said, yeah,  fuck you and your set.  And then his friends that were holding him back went, what, what, what, what?  So there was three people that want to fight.  And his set?  Why would you even say that?  Because fuck him.  I was mad.  This is L.A.  Fuck him and his set.  Yo, I'm crazy.  Fuck him and the Crips.  Like, just leave him alone. 
[03:44:30]  Don't, motherfucker.  Fuck that.  He was a fucking piece of garbage.  You host Last Comic Standing.  Just go inside and shut your fucking mouth.  And you know how I got that job in the octagon.  I earned it.  And by the way, I'm not saying I'm going to fuck up Joe Rogan.  Them people are turning to something.  Y'all, they'll do that.  I'm saying if I've seen him, like, you go, man, does this motherfucker look like something?  I don't know.  You saw Andre, what's his name?  The fucker that looks like.  You know that's going to turn into that on the message boards.  Patrice said he could fucking kick your ass, Joe.  What's his name is doing in the world? 
[03:45:00]  Fedor.  Oh, yeah.  Fedor was sitting there looking just like a guy.  You just go, I'm going to push Fedor.  Yeah.  Were you here when we interviewed Fedor?  Yeah.  I was in Irvine listening to you guys in the replay.  You could hear the fear in our voices, right?  I like halfway through the translation, he'd go, he doesn't look like somebody that walks  in and will fuck you up.  You're crazy.  You don't remember Mitch Mullaney?  He doesn't.  Dude, he had that look in his eye, man.  Because we already knew.  Let me rewind real quick.  Do you remember Mitch Mullaney? 
[03:45:30]  This sweater was a little weird.  Yes.  Yeah.  Okay.  We were in this fight in the sidewalk and we fought this guy for a half hour because  he wouldn't go down.  He was on PCP.  And I mean, four people hit this guy from his hairline to his forehead for 30 minutes.  Oh, shit.  And he just going, fucking niggers.  Fucking niggers.  Just kept yelling it over and over.  Four white guys hitting him.  He just kept yelling, fucking niggers.  We didn't blame him.  Oh, well, you earned it.  So Mitch Mullaney pulls up in like a 72 Cadillac coupe and he gets out.  And apparently Mitch grew up like in Oakland fighting. 
[03:46:00]  Like that was his thing.  But he's like a nerdy white guy.  Yeah.  And Mitch gets out of his car and goes, all right.  And like pulls up his pants and just starts like hitting the guy's friends.  Like he's boxing the hell out of the guy and like hitting the guy's friend when he feels  like it.  Like, wow.  Take that with you.  Like Mitch was good with his fingers?  Crazy.  Like the, like Richard Pryor's Ali joke.  Like, take that with you.  Mitch Mullaney had it.  Nick Freno was his, his break.  That was, he had a show called Nick Freno on WB.  I don't remember.  I'll, I'll have to Google him. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah, Mitch Mullaney.  Just died too.  Mitch Mullaney can box, yeah.  It was crazy.  And we were all like, thank God he came in.  Diabetes.  So you know he grew up with black.  Like that motherfucker.  You know, you don't hear about white people.  He died of the diabetes?  Yeah, he had diabetes.  Complications.  Were you at the tyrant thing yesterday, Patrice?  Yes, I caused it.  How great was that?  You see that?  Only a group of black women would start something that riotous.  Oh my God, that car is going to blow up!  A car with smoke coming out of it.  And do you see the close-ups of some of those models?  Oh yeah. 
[03:47:00]  They're wearing wave caps.  Stay home.  Looks like Randy Moss at 5'6".  Oh my God, that car is going to explode!  You see all the slut clothes in the street?  I didn't see the slut clothes.  I just saw the ones that...  They had to clean it up like they cleaned up snow.  There was so much.  I saw a group photo.  It looked like employees of Dwayne Reed.  Oh my God, he got a gun!  Obviously a shitload of fucking people in front.  They kind of did a who thing.  It was time to open the doors and everyone pushed forward. 
[03:47:30]  But why was there a he?  It was a group of female models and some girl goes,  Oh my God, he got a gun!  There was a gun?  No, but they just caused hysteria.  Yeah, somebody said somebody had a gun.  What are you doing in town, Jay?  Do we know?  That's right.  Just press for the thing, the show.  The guy you're married?  The thing.  Why are you downplaying that?  Press for the thing!  Why are you downplaying that?  I watched this show.  It's a big hit.  I'll tell you what.  They got him.  It's a show where a guy almost can be a dude. 
[03:48:00]  They got him almost as a dude.  And that's not an insult.  I know what you mean.  No, we were just talking about this this morning.  He's almost like...  Where every white guy on TV is just a fucking douche.  He's not a complete slouching towards Gamora.  Right.  Yeah.  Just a poor douche.  Who was talking about that book here?  Huh?  Who was talking about slouching towards Gamora?  Nick DiPaolo.  Yeah.  Right.  But every white guy on TV is just like, okay.  It's just the worst.  We were talking about that commercials where the fucking wife is inside looking at her incompetent  husband trying to barbecue.  Yeah.  And he's like running back and forth on fire. 
[03:48:30]  And she's like, oh, that idiot.  But your wife...  That's what white people are now.  White guys.  Your wife on the show still does shit that you just go...  That real...  It just wouldn't happen.  Like, she interferes with a little bit of this and that.  Like, you just go...  But that's what I'm saying.  It's like almost there.  But an ex-wife having that much say in a guy's life, you just go, bitch, shut the fuck.  That's such a stupid mouth.  Bitch!  Like, because some of it's not even with the kids.  That's how it is in rehearsal.  It's just...  You know. 
[03:49:00]  Fucking Jay.  I love Jay.  You know, like when you get a script...  Play along, Patrice.  But when you get a script in show business...  Oh, fair enough.  As I get thrown off, I swear to God, I'm just trying to figure out how to get a fucking job.  His big reference is Corey Holcomb.  As a fighter.  But as a comic...  What about Gary Goleman?  I almost fought Gary Goleman.  Gary looks like a fucking guy.  Who wins in a fight?  Me or Gary Goleman?  By eyes?  No, no, no. 
[03:49:30]  Just...  By looking...  I don't know.  By eyes?  By looking...  It's a fucking staring contest?  Is Chris Jericho here?  We're going to have a blink off?  He could scrap.  You know that at least.  I know Jay could scrap.  He's from Jersey and he got a big mouth.  So you know he had the beef.  Gary's intense, though.  Gary Goleman, I'd say Gary would beat Jay just looking.  That's what I mean.  Just looking at the two.  What do you think, Jay?  You know.  Oh, I don't...  It'd be over.  It's great.  You or him?  I'd win, yeah.  Yeah, nice.  We almost got in a fight on Last Comic Standing and then it got separated and then I was driving  away. 
[03:50:00]  I had an assistant at the time, this kid Charlie.  And Charlie was a big dude, man.  Charlie was like 300 pounds, like 6'6", defensive end.  He played for Miami.  Yeah.  And we're driving away and I go, you know what bothers me?  I go, look at Corey Holcomb over there just standing there outside.  Just look.  You know, what bothers me the most is Corey Holcomb thinks that Gary Goleman would have  beat me up.  And then my assistant looked at me like, that's what I think too?  And I go, turn the fucking car around right now.  And I went back.  We made a U-turn in the CBS City Center parking lot. 
[03:50:30]  And I got out of the car and I went into Corey...  I went into Gary Old...  Gary Oldman.  Gary Goldman.  Jay, what are you doing here?  Yeah.  I went into Gary Goldman's dressing room and said, all right, motherfucker.  And then he threw a bottle of water at me and Tammy Pescatelli held him back.  Tammy?  But I got held back by Alonzo.  What about Philly?  I got held back by Alonzo.  Why the street anger though, Jay?  I can't have a fucking assistant thinking I would have gotten beaten up.  But why are you not above that?  What is wrong with you?  I'm above it now.  Because I don't give a shit about anything. 
[03:51:00]  That shit was last week.  Last coming standing.  That was two years ago.  That was a while ago now.  Gary Goldman's was four years ago?  I was married to someone else.  Oh, so he was making things are different.  I was an angry, angry, angry, upset, not happy person.  Just wanted the beef.  Yeah.  I couldn't hit her.  Nikki calmed you down.  Nikki helped her.  Turned my whole life.  Saved my life.  Absolutely saved my life.  Do you feel like you're just as funny as you was when you was angry?  Way funnier.  You're funnier now.  Yeah, because it's not an act.  It's all personal things that happened to me.  It's all stories that really happened. 
[03:51:30]  It's not like I'm not on stage to get pussy or to impress everybody.  Stories.  Okay.  Okay.  Stories.  That's true.  What about Philly's own Keith Robinson?  What do you think?  Keith can beef.  Keith can fight.  God damn it, Patrice.  You know I can fight.  God damn it.  He's doing a piss of the black man today.  God damn it.  I told him.  I was with Kevin.  You remember Chappie from Boston?  I was with Chappie.  Chappie's an actor.  He's in everything.  And he's in this movie.  He's on the show.  He's on the show.  He's on the show.  Yeah. 
[03:52:00]  Chappie and Keith Robinson were in my apartment playing Madden.  And Keith was running the shit.  Like, Keith had everyone crying.  Like, not at a laughter.  You could not beat.  He was the Cowboys.  You could not beat him at Madden.  Right.  And he's playing Chappie.  And Chappie's the path or somebody's like, I'm going to run right, Chappie.  God damn it.  I'm going to run right.  God damn it, Chappie.  I told you I was going to run right.  Look at that.  Oh, I got a touchdown, Chappie.  God damn it.  And Chappie is like a crazy, like, South Boston, angry, angry, angry, South Boston white man. 
[03:52:30]  Oh, he's fucking Whitey Bulger white.  Like, he could beat up Joe Rogan.  Oh, shit.  You can't teach rage.  You know what I mean?  He's totally Whitey Bulger.  You know, he went and paid back Whitey Bulger everything he owns at the candy store.  And Kevin Weeks, Whitey Bulger's, like, muscle guy, was staring at him the whole time.  And then Whitey Bulger looked up at Chappie and goes, what about the points, Chappie?  And he's like, what do you mean?  He goes, what about the juice that you owe?  Chappie goes, look, I've been sober a year. 
[03:53:00]  You know, I used to smoke crack.  And I'm sober now.  And I don't drink.  Like, that's every penny I've ever owned in my life.  I'm going home to a mattress on the floor.  You can kill me right fucking now.  That's all I got.  And get this fucking monkey out of my face.  Oh, shit.  Kevin Weeks is like, but, like, this close, you know?  And Whitey Bulger, like, for a minute, just stares at Chappie and goes, all right, you're  all right.  Go ahead.  Get out of here.  Him and his wife go on vacation to the Grand Canyon with another couple.  And everyone said Whitey Bulger. 
[03:53:30]  That's where he went when he went on the Witness Protection Program.  He wouldn't pose for photos of the Grand Canyon.  Because he was afraid Whitey Bulger would see him.  This is, yeah, Chappie.  Like, Whitey ran.  He was the guy.  Chappie was a fucking Southie.  Go over there and pose for a picture.  Chappie's like, no, no, no, I'll take it.  You guys go ahead.  Like, he would take it.  But he wouldn't pose because he didn't want Whitey Bulger to go, there's that motherfucker.  And, by the way, St. Grand Canyon.  I'm kind of there.  For some reason, I was up all night, one night, just looking at most wanted, every state, 
[03:54:00]  most wanted anything.  Yeah.  Just looking at who's wanted.  He's up there.  Interesting two things.  One, Whitey Bulger is in the world's most wanted.  Yeah.  Really?  Not just FBI.  Not just North Korea.  Oh, yeah, they want that motherfucker bad.  Along with cartel dudes from Mexico and some Russian dude that looks like a Chinese dude  from, like, Kazakhstan.  Whitey Bulger is in the top ten world's most wanted motherfuckers with Bin Laden.  And that was interesting. 
[03:54:30]  And the second thing is, in New Jersey, the top wanted person in New Jersey is a black  woman who shot a cop, shot a state trooper 30 years ago and went to Cuba.  And they haven't been able to get her from Cuba.  They know where she is.  Like, the most wanted?  Do you know what her name is?  In New Jersey?  How long before there's free blank t-shirts floating around?  No, and that's...  How come every time a black person gets arrested, you gotta, I have to fucking free them.  Why not free James Brown?  James Brown took a shotgun and unloaded it into a police car. 
[03:55:00]  Fuck James Brown.  Free Michael Jackson.  Michael Jackson puts kids' asses up to his face.  Free the juice.  O.J. lopped off two people's heads like a fucking homemade guillotine.  If that Husky, if that Akita could have talked, he would have been in jail ten years ago.  They would have put that dog on the stand.  Marrow, that nigga did it!  The dog had blood on...  The dog's all mad.  He's got blood on his little fruity feet. 
[03:55:30]  You know, those Akitas...  Fuck, that's why I needed that coffee.  Jay.  Jay just woke up.  A big glass of his act.  No.  God damn.  That fruity Akita could have put O.J. away.  It's stupid.  I hate Akitas.  Their tail curls forward, so you gotta stare at their asshole all day.  And they know it.  And they're high in hair.  Their leg on their hind legs is always poofed out.  There's always loose chains and shit stuck to their ass.  It's never clean.  There's always a mint. 
[03:56:00]  From a diner.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, shut up.  Did you fart?  Yeah.  I was trying to do it.  Oh, Jesus.  You know what?  You laughed too hard.  You popped one out.  I'll be honest with you.  Not...  Actually, not bad.  I was doing it with fucking the Ink Girls in there.  It smells like...  It smells like his stars were running.  It smells like...  It smells like...  It smells like fall meat.  It smells like soy...  Soy duck.  It's not bad.  It's nice.  I'm like, I'm not bad.  Mike and the Mad Dog.  It's a little sweet.  Patrice O'Neal farted.  We're gonna be back in the fam in the flesh. 
[03:56:30]  In the flesh.  Well, he's vegetarian now.  We were talking about Jay, and you guys said...  Jay did the best something in the business.  Oh, my God.  The only something.  Well, the impression...  One of the impressions was beautiful.  You know what's good about Jay's impression?  Your rosary's backwards.  Could you turn it around for me?  It's making me nuts.  Oh, the fucking Colin...  Please show a little respect, officer.  Oh, the Colin Quinn is...  Colin's great.  No, there was one, though.  You want to fight, officer?  Not the Christopher Walken thing.  Get the hell out of my house.  We've been down that road.  There's a newer one. 
[03:57:00]  He does obscure fucking things that are really good, man.  Obscure impressions are the best thing in the world.  Norm MacDonald.  Would you say you...  Now, would you put...  Now, this is...  He's another one that's...  You, too, there's rare where guys that do impressions that do good ones are funny motherfuckers  at the same time.  It's very rare.  But would you put yourself up against...  What's the guy?  The dude from TBS.  Oh, Caliendo?  Yeah, would you put...  Yeah, I declared war on him a while ago. 
[03:57:30]  I wanted, like, a Biggie Tupac thing going on.  Who's better?  Who do you think is as good or better when you go out?  I think I'm better because I make up...  No, anybody.  Anybody who does it.  I think the best impression I've ever seen was Roger Cable.  It was the best I've...  That's where I learned to do Walken, watching him.  Roger Cable?  Yeah.  I thought Roger Cable was the best.  No, but he was too crazy for...  The best.  Really?  I'd be surprised if he stole...  How about Aries Spears?  Would you go up against Aries?  No.  Not Aries, but you think you're as good as... 
[03:58:00]  As an impressionist?  Yeah.  Who does he do?  Star Jones?  What does he do?  He does Shaq.  He does...  I think he's Shaq, too.  But that's what he does?  So, I mean, look.  I just did it in my fucking sleep.  What are you talking about?  I do a lot of fucking famous for you, don't I?  Chase declared war on all these guys.  See, don't you understand?  Bill Walton broke the code of the big man.  Wow.  That's code 222.7.  Those below, do not criticize those above.  It is sleep. 
[03:58:30]  I got four rings.  He's got one.  So, he needs to shut his mouth.  Do that.  There you go.  Motherfucker, I don't have to...  Name other black people.  Yeah, let's go.  Want to hear my Chris Tucker?  That don't...  Yeah.  That doesn't count?  It doesn't count.  Because you don't have to know English.  All right.  Denzel.  I can't do Denzel.  But I saw a guy on YouTube do it.  He was phenomenal.  Morgan Freeman.  All right.  You got me.  See, I'm not going to go the easy route where it's like people do a... 
[03:59:00]  Man!  You know, the Chris Tucker...  I don't even say words.  What's it?  Go ahead.  Do it for a second.  Beep, beep.  Beep, beep.  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, radio.  Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, man.  Ba, man.  We've been letting you know.  Beep, ba, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  You motherfucking sounds like traffic.  He's terrible.  He's terrible.  God damn.  Patrice, you're too heavy to laugh that hard.  Yeah, really. 
[03:59:30]  That's good, right?  Beep, beep, man.  You do rock?  I know you must do a Chris Rock.  You got to.  No.  He's like my favorite comic, though.  You don't do a Chris Rock?  Well, all I can do with him is, like, regurgitate what he already says.  But I really, my favorite thing about doing impressions is creating my own act for those  people.  Okay.  Like, I hate when people do an impression to somebody and do something that they say.  Like doing a movie or something.  Like when Caliendo does Seinfeld.  He's like, what's wrong with people? 
[04:00:00]  Yeah.  Like, well, I've heard Jerry Seinfeld say that.  I think Caliendo's, uh, the one that's, the John Madden.  Well, here's a guy who jumps, he goes higher, and he runs, like, did you do that before  him, though?  Did you already do that?  No, I'm just doing, when you say them, I just do them.  But he fucking, no one does a fucking Madden.  Like that.  I just did it.  It was pretty good.  Fuck that.  No, he does a really, he does a really good Bush.  Who?  Caliendo.  He does. 
[04:00:30]  He does a really good Bush.  And he does a good Al Pacino.  On the phone, it's good.  You know what?  No one likes Pacino, too.  How about the young Pacino?  How about fucking Dog Day?  Okay, we're Vietnam veterans.  We don't mind killing.  That don't mean nothing to us.  It's Tyne Daly from Cagney and Lacey.  No, I just do the young Al Pacino with the broken jaw.  What if he's a dirty cop?  He was a bad cop.  We have people on the papers.  You know, you gotta have, you gotta have the, uh, the broken jaw one.  The broken jaw.  Look, we'll go someplace.  All right, here's, uh, all right, Dog Day Afternoon.  Okay.  Any W play all the hits. 
[04:01:00]  Well, you got a boss?  Why am I talking to you, then?  How about his boyfriend?  You want to talk to him?  You talk to him.  Don't kill me.  I always hit the rope.  Why, Leon?  Why now?  When things are going so well.  I did everything.  Up as, down as, scream as.  Is there a Harvey Keitel?  You're kidding.  I'm asking.  You haven't heard the Harvey?  It's a big one.  You've never heard me do Harvey Keitel?  It's my actual, you don't listen to our show.  Is there a Harvey Keitel?  Ooh, snizznap.  Is there a Harvey Keitel?  Snizzle, vrap. 
[04:01:30]  Snizzle, zapp, zapp, zapp, zapp.  There is a Harvey Keitel.  Is he able to be, have an impression done of him?  Oh, hell yeah.  What movie?  What's the Harvey Keitel?  Bad Lieutenant?  Bad Lieutenant.  Let us.  Gentlemen, the series must go seven games.  The revenue money alone.  Between those two towns.  There's no jobs in this town.  Is there?  You motherfucker.  Come on, Daniels.  Eyes.  Eyes.  Good eye.  You nigga cocksucker. 
[04:02:00]  Whip, whip, whip, whip.  I like when he's smoking crack in the hallway.  Now he's Michael Winslow.  And the guy, his crack dealer goes, you know, that shit's going to kill you.  And Keitel goes, what kind of businessman are you?  You can't even back your own product.  Women get raped every day.  Now this one wears a penguin suit.  They put up a reward.  The church is a racket.  What the fuck's wrong with you? 
[04:02:30]  Are you a Catholic?  I'm a Catholic.  I'm blessed.  You know, this guy will blow up your fucking house with your family in it.  Good.  He'd be doing me a fucking favor.  Say the goddamn words.  Who's going to be okay?  Say the goddamn words.  Wait, what's that from?  Reservoir Dogs.  Reservoir Dogs.  Goddamn, now I'm on some fucking...  Excuse me, are you a doctor?  Then you admit your medical opinion means nothing. 
[04:03:00]  Why can't you do a Denzel?  Because I haven't...  Because I don't know.  He hasn't tried, really.  Dean does a great...  Dean Edwards, right?  Dean, yeah.  He's a good impression.  Denzel's a rough one, man.  Dean does a great Tracy Morgan.  I did Forrest Whitaker.  Generic.  I got...  You know what?  I'm being an asshole because he did do Forrest Whitaker and a Harvey Keitel.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which is a big deal.  I can do Ina, the barefoot contester from the Food Network.  I'm trying to get as obscure as possible.  As obscure as possible. 
[04:03:30]  As obscure.  I sound like my son.  Oh.  Paddy, I'm trying to be as obscure as possible.  You're gonna be okay.  Say the goddamn words.  You're gonna be okay.  Did you ever say the goddamn words?  No, that's the only one we got on that, unfortunately.  You're gonna be okay.  Hey, there's a lot of points back here.  Hey, does the son have a sense of humor yet?  It's terrible.  It's terrible.  Yeah, he's a scientist.  He's not like a particularly...  He'll go, Daddy, you want to hear something funny?  What's two plus two? 
[04:04:00]  I'll go, what?  He'll say, cookie.  And I'll just stare at him.  But I don't like go, oh, that's great.  I look at him like, that's terrible.  That's awful.  That's a great way to raise kids.  Just be so adult with them.  You just stunk.  You can maybe mix that in the middle, but I wouldn't do it up top or at the end.  In fact, you can blend it in at, you know, at like minute 11.  Just say it as an aside while you sip your coffee.  Don't open it with that.  Second show Friday, you can say that after you ask a waitress for coffee.  Ron and Fez are still in their dressing room getting ready.  In the meantime, enjoy some of the worst of Opie Anthony on the Virus Sirius XM. 
[04:04:30]  The worst of the Opie Anthony show.  Yeah, I was enjoying Jimmy strumming the guitar.  That was kind of nice.  Pete Correale.  Could you give us a little something?  Pete Correale was trying to play guitar.  Pete had the funniest fucking joke.  Because he plays, he's trying to play guitar.  He goes, playing guitar is so hard.  If I didn't see other people do it, I wouldn't think it could be done.  Fucking die.  All right, Jimmy's going to.  Funny observation.  I think everyone's tried at some point to play the guitar. 
[04:05:00]  And then it's just, look how he just holds the guitar.  You're holding it like Jose Feliciano.  Exactly, I am.  He was blind.  He didn't know any better.  Hey, it could do a lot worse.  Yeah.  Jose Feliciano.  I could point it like that, like Johnny Cash would do.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  That's all I do.  You're just doing open.  Yeah.  Listen, I stop and I talk.  That's how I do my whole act.  That's good.  Guys who have musical instruments and don't play them.  Just strum along, man.  I wish I could play the guitar.  I would just sing to my girlfriend all the time. 
[04:05:30]  Serenade.  Don't be such a cunt.  It's only 6 a.m.  He's writing a fucking nagging text on the way to work.  He didn't say goodbye to me.  He didn't say goodbye to me.  Sorry, I'm not going to Vietnam, shithead.  He's the worst of the open air three show. </pre>
