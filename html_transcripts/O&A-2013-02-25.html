<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a scathing critique of the Academy Awards ceremony.  The hosts, using highly vulgar language, lambasted the Oscars' pacing, the placement of awards, and the significant viewer drop-off after 11 PM.  Their commentary included harsh opinions on various celebrities’ performances, specifically targeting Seth MacFarlane's hosting, Queen Latifah's appearance, and Kristen Stewart's demeanor.  They also offered equally blunt opinions on *Argo*, *Silver Linings Playbook*, and *Django Unchained*, alongside considerable criticism of the musical numbers, particularly one featuring Russell Crowe and a discussion of Shirley Basie’s technically flawed performance of "Goldfinger." The segment also included discussion of internal studio issues, like computer malfunctions, a stalled wall-moving project, and a potentially jeopardized bus tour, as well as their dissatisfaction with a SiriusXM memo promoting an interview with Jamie Foxx and Trayvon Martin's family.  They played a recording of Pavarotti and James Brown singing "It's a Man's World," contrasting it with Barbra Streisand's rendition of "The Way We Were."

The comedic review of the Oscars continued, highlighting its length and perceived boredom.  A funny sketch featuring Sally Field and a Boniva joke were mentioned, alongside the Best Sound Editing tie.  The hosts debated the merits of various actors (Daniel Day-Lewis, Tom Hanks, Mark Wahlberg) and actresses (Charlize Theron, Jennifer Aniston, Chelsea Handler), often focusing on their appearances and hairstyles.  They also discussed the awkward near-kiss between 50 Cent and Aaron Andrews at the Daytona 500.  A significant portion focused on "Lonely Virgil," a former wrestler who aggressively attends autograph signings, sets up his own table, and charges for photos and autographs, despite a lack of customers.  Numerous anecdotes and photos illustrated Virgil's tactics, including crashing a Ted DiBiase signing.  A caller recounted a story of Virgil grabbing a woman's breast, and a photo of him selling autographs in a subway station was shown.  A NASCAR crash and resulting injuries were briefly mentioned.  The segment was rife with profanity.

Further discussion of Virgil's exploits continued, with anecdotes about his solitary autograph signing appearances and a played clip of Chris Jericho discussing him from a previous show.  The conversation then shifted to Larry King's interview style, citing bizarre questions, including one about the importance of a skateboard "board" and another about groceries asked to a rape victim.  A lengthy debate ensued on the dinosaur extinction, focusing on the Chicxulub impactor and the iridium layer, with callers offering various perspectives and countering a caller's dismissal of the impactor theory based on a recent meteorite event in Russia.  The conversation also touched upon the rapid advancement of technology and the recording of life's events, along with a humorous anecdote about an encounter with Dr. Michio Kaku.  The hosts shared personal anecdotes: one about a creepy encounter with Chad Smith, mistaking him for Will Ferrell, and another about their children's reaction to the Museum of Natural History.  A segment from a show featuring Deborah Tate discussing the Sharon Tate murder with Larry King was played.  Additional commentary on the Oscars, including critiques of its length and jokes, and a phone call with Kevin Smith concluding the segment.

The phone interview with Kevin Smith followed, covering his Oscar voting experience (abstaining due to not seeing all nominated films and a conflict of interest), his opinions on *Life of Pi*, *Zero Dark Thirty*, and *Lincoln* (he fell asleep during the latter two), and Rhythm and Hughes' bankruptcy.  He commented on Seth MacFarlane's hosting and Anne Hathaway's acceptance speech, praising Jennifer Hudson's performance above Adele, Barbra Streisand, and Shirley Bassey (a point debated by the hosts).  He shared a detailed anecdote about visiting Quentin Tarantino's house.  The conversation touched on the Academy Awards process, the Golden Globes, and the Hollywood Foreign Press.  The hosts then shifted to other topics: a Tom Popper party, "Meatball Month," Mayor Bloomberg's soda ban, and an upcoming trailer for a Jay and Silent Bob cartoon movie.

The final segment began with a discussion of a poorly produced radio promo.  Sam Roberts, a recurring guest, further detailed Virgil's exploits and his website, LonelyVirgil.net, highlighting its unintended popularity on Deadspin.  A "Line of the Day" segment followed, including jokes about Lincoln's hat and a Virgil anecdote.  The hosts discussed Dr. Michio Kaku's apparent avoidance of them following past appearances.  A caller, Jason, shared his own experience with Virgil, contrasting it with a positive encounter with The Rock.  The conversation returned to the Oscars, covering its length, Seth MacFarlane's hosting, Royal Caribbean's sponsorship (including Kristen Chenoweth's involvement), and E-Rock’s passionate opinions on cruises. Wendy McClendon-Covey joined as a guest, discussing her career, including *Bridesmaids*, *Reno 911* (and her firing via email), *Masters of Sex*, and online searches associating her name with "feet."  She offered opinions on the Oscars and working with Tyler Perry. The show concluded with the hosts thanking their guest.

[00:00:30]  Music  Music  Music  Music  Music  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  For us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  It's not going to get any better than this. 
[00:04:00]  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  All in a day every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Rules are destroyed.  Rules are destroyed and conventions burn to the ground.  Would you like to make some fucking second?  With Opie the destroyer. 
[00:04:30]  Hey, asshole.  Just take the joke and take a little beating.  It'll be okay.  Anthony the Rage.  I feel like dog shit.  I feel like dog shit.  If I'm sick, I'm fucking off and my agent has to be called by the rat down the fucking hall.  And Jim Norton, lover of transvestites.  How do you not look at a cock if it's there?  I'm not gay or anything, but for Pete's sake, I'm not rude.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:05:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  All right.  How is it?  Monday.  What?  Monday.  What happened?  Monday.  But it was just the start of the weekend.  That's right.  We were all like, woo-hoo, start the weekend.  Let's start our weekend.  And then it's over.  Doesn't seem fair.  Really.  Not fair.  Not fair.  Wow.  Oh, boo.  Look, man. 
[00:05:30]  Hurry.  They gotta figure that Oscar shit out.  Yeah?  They gotta figure it out.  I was telling you before the show, it's really simple what you gotta do.  The first hour of the show is okay.  And the middle of an hour and a half is horrendously boring.  It's sad.  Horrendously fucking boring.  And then they squeeze all the interesting awards in for the last, what, half hour or two?  One hour to 40 minutes.  Yeah, the big ones.  You gotta give out all the major awards by 11 o'clock so everyone can go with their stupid local news, right? 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  But then you keep the Oscars going for whoever the fuck, you know, wants to continue watching.  And throw all that garbage at the end.  But no one's gonna watch them.  Yeah, but who cares?  As long as you get the audience until 11 is what I'm saying.  Why extend it and make it so long?  You see people, now that you got Twitter and social networking, you see everyone tapping out.  You see, well...  Yeah, that's true.  Good night.  Well, that's it.  See you tomorrow.  Good night.  You saw it.  Yeah. 
[00:06:30]  The whole audience is just fading away because they don't want to wait till almost midnight  on a Sunday to see who won Best Picture.  I found out this morning.  I couldn't wait.  And I watched...  I committed three and a half hours of that nonsense.  There's an article that said after 11 o'clock, they lose 100,000 viewers a minute.  So why...  Because everybody on the East Coast starts at 2 and a half.  So why not just give the big awards before 11, but the Oscars continue?  So they can fucking continue, you know, patting themselves on the back for another hour out there.  Maybe because people don't realize it's gonna be last all the time. 
[00:07:00]  We know it because you're thinking about it.  Everyone knows.  People don't think...  I think everyone knows at this point.  It'll be soon.  Matt's, the biggest awards always last.  People don't realize how long it's gonna take to get to.  They shove it all in at the end.  It's just ridiculous.  Yeah, they spend like 9 o'clock to 10 o'clock was...  I don't know what, but I know I didn't miss anything when I watched The Walking  Dead.  But I know it was like a bunch of musical stuff and a bunch of like visual and technical  awards.  From 8.30 to 9.30, because it started at 8.30, it was, you know, it was cool.  Yeah. 
[00:07:30]  You get to see everyone, get to see Cleavage and shit, get to hear a few good jokes.  Because then like Seth MacFarlane taps out.  There's an hour there where he's barely the host anymore, too.  Yeah, that is a weird thing with the hosting.  Like they just disappear for a while.  Yeah.  And then...  A lot of people take over.  That middle area is just, it's just a dead zone.  Yeah.  There's nothing going on there.  You don't even know half the movies.  There's a good sketch they did, though, with...  Which one?  What's her name?  The fat girl...  Oh, Melissa McCarthy and Paul Rudd. 
[00:08:00]  Boy, was that a bomb.  I couldn't really hear it.  How bad was that?  I couldn't really hear it, because I was at the cellar.  I could hear part of it.  It was really, really bad.  It fell.  I missed that one.  It fell flat.  They got to stop doing them.  Yeah, they got to stop doing them.  If actors can't pull it off, and this is what these guys do, you got to stop having  people...  Because they're trying to do a scene where they're reading off the fucking cue.  Oh, yeah.  You can't do it.  It was really bad.  They're never good.  And even though Paul Rudd grew a beard, he's still Paul Rudd. 
[00:08:30]  He's just Paul Rudd in everything he does.  Everything.  No, that was really, really bad.  So Argo won, I guess?  I only found out a few minutes ago.  Argo.  Argo, yeah.  Even though I committed over three hours to this thing.  Even more, I did the red carpet shit.  Oh.  Yeah.  Well.  And then I didn't even see Quentin Tarantino win for writing.  It's great writing.  Yeah.  I tapped out after Queen Latifah, that fucking monster. 
[00:09:00]  Holy fuck.  What'd she do?  You know...  That's a big bitch.  Anyone that's...  Anyone that says Queen Latifah's sexy or fucking sexy...  She was standing next to real, regular human beings.  Right.  She looked like a fucking monster.  She's a big bitch.  She's giant.  Her tits, from nipple to nipple, have to be five feet apart.  She is...  Yeah.  She's got the good skin. 
[00:09:30]  She's got an okay face.  But there's nothing special there.  She's a monster.  She's got a nice smile, but...  Oh, was she a loser?  That is a...  She is big, man.  It's not...  You put her...  You put her next to girls?  Right.  Fuck.  She looked like a beast.  Who was up there?  Renee Zellweger?  Yeah.  Is she a drunk?  I don't know.  She was...  She's got that, like, eyes half shut whenever she smiles look.  Well, even when she's not smiling, the eyes are half shut, but I think... 
[00:10:00]  Renee Zellweger.  I don't think...  But that's not why I'm saying that she's a drunk.  She just presents herself in a strange way.  Yeah.  But is she one of those weird actresses that are shy and can't watch themselves?  Maybe.  And they're awkward in their own skin?  Yeah.  I think Kim Basinger is like that, too, right?  I'm not sure.  That one fucking actress, though, that looked like she was on heroin.  Who?  Oh.  Kristen Stewart?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's always like that.  I love her.  I love that look on her face.  Do you like her?  She drives me crazy.  She really looks fucking shot. 
[00:10:30]  She does, though.  But she just looks like she's really got a pretty mouth and a pretty smile.  Pretty mouth.  And she's dirty.  You know, she likes that older...  She is dirty.  She likes that older director dick.  Yeah.  Naughty.  Look at her.  She's fucking...  I don't know.  I don't know what her deal is.  She's great, man.  She's a bore.  Why wasn't he there, that guy, her boyfriend?  I don't know.  He probably had something better to do.  Maybe it's embarrassing for him.  Right.  No.  Be in public with that fucking whore.  So, our go on.  So, you got the Quentin Tarantino for the writing.  And then, you got Daniel Day-Lewis. 
[00:11:00]  Lincoln.  I'm doing people a favor that tapped out.  A little recap.  Because they have to get up for fucking work.  And then, wait.  Daniel Day-Lewis, best actor.  And then Jennifer Lawrence for Silver Lining Playbook.  Yeah, for Actress.  Right.  Mm-hmm.  That's all the stuff I missed.  But that was like three of the big awards right there.  That's it.  Three or four of the big awards.  Yeah.  All squeezed in for the last ten minutes.  Yeah.  What did you think of Seth MacFarlane?  It was so easy for people to just fucking hate him on Twitter.  But I thought he was really, really good. 
[00:11:30]  I thought he did real well.  Did people hate him on Twitter?  Haters.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Twitter haters.  Yeah, you realize Twitter is just pretty much nonsense at this point.  It's just a bastion of hatred for people that are actually talented.  He did a great job.  He looked the part completely.  He's got a great voice.  Mm-hmm.  And the jokes were, you know, you're not going to hit every single one of them, but I think  his jokes were funny.  It was funny.  You know, they were fucking, you know, beating on Hollywood, edgy and shit like that.  Right.  I liked it.  I thought he did a great job. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, I thought he did pretty good.  Yeah.  I thought William Shatner helped him out a lot, huh?  I missed that, too, because I came in late.  Although that piece ran a little long, but it was an all right piece.  I came in late for the Star Trek thing.  Ah, you know, you had William Shatner from the future telling him about his performance  before his performance even really got underway.  That's pretty funny.  Yeah, it was all right.  I guess.  And then he had the Boop song, which was pretty fucking funny.  Very Family Guy-ish.  Yeah.  All those his wacky songs.  I missed the opening.  Yeah, but it's him, so it's always going to be known as Family Guy-ish. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, Family Guy-ish.  Family Guy-guy.  Family Guy-gay.  Mm-hmm.  And what, people hated that one joke?  What, Lincoln?  The John Wilkes Booth joke.  It was funny.  Because he said the last actor to get, you forget that Wilkes Booth was an actor.  Yeah.  So he's like, the last actor to get in his head was John Wilkes Booth.  I thought it was a clever joke.  Yeah.  I was watching Killing Lincoln on, I guess it was on the NACIO or History or something. 
[00:13:00]  I was watching, sorry to jump in.  Yeah.  John Wilkes Booth's acting was horrendous and I couldn't watch it anymore.  Really?  It was horrible.  Wait, wait, the guy that was playing John Wilkes Booth?  Yeah, it was horrible.  It was horrible?  Yes.  I was watching that.  I had to stick it out, though.  Why would you do that knowing Lincoln was out?  Yeah, yeah.  I was watching it.  I thought it was pretty good.  Let's put that together, you know, another year or two from now.  A little history.  Let people sort of forget about Lincoln a little bit.  The thing is, though, I was trying to figure out, because they kept saying, like, everyone 
[00:13:30]  forgets or didn't know or whatever that John Wilkes Booth was a very popular actor at the  time.  Like, and I was like, okay, that's like equating, like, who?  What actor these days?  George Clooney.  Is it that big?  Like, was it, would it be like if George Clooney tried to assassinate the president?  Maybe.  Or assassinate the president?  Is that, like, who it would be?  Or would it be, like, someone from a reality show?  A less popular actor.  Like, how big was John Wilkes Booth?  Would it be De Niro? 
[00:14:00]  Or would it be, like, fucking The Situation?  That's a very good question.  Yeah, I'm trying to figure it out.  Was he a popular actor for the day because he killed Lincoln?  Yeah.  Is your question?  Yeah.  Like, could you imagine, you know, like you said, George Clooney's like, did you hear  George Clooney fucking, you know, assassinate him?  Would he be considered a good actor if he never was involved with Lincoln?  Right.  Would he go down in history as a great actor?  Who's a, I don't know how popular he was, though. 
[00:14:30]  Name me one other actor from that era.  I know, right?  Who the fuck else are you going to get?  Who was on stage that night for Our American Cousin.  And then they show, like, could you just put a guy at the door to Lincoln's box?  It's like, how the fuck did he just walk in and blast his head off?  That's where it all began.  It's just stupid.  No one thought that you'd need to protect anybody.  Just put a guy at the door for the love of crazy.  I think that's where it all began right there.  I think it is.  You're right.  People have said, you know what, we better have a guy at the door from now on. 
[00:15:00]  This president thing.  People seem to be a little pissed at him occasionally.  Yeah.  Otto has the funniest joke.  He's the guy who shot Lincoln.  It was the guy sitting behind him at the theater.  He was six foot nine and wore a top hat.  And then Otto does the guy.  He goes, honey, I can't see the band.  This cocksucker's got his hat on.  I can't see the band.  I can't see the band.  He's got his hat on.  This cocksucker's got his hat on.  He's got his hat on.  That's great.  What else?  McFarlane did all right. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  Definitely more than all right.  The freaking musical montage was just an...  How gay was that?  Well, I love Travolta because he's now saying, look at me, bitches.  I'm going to come walking out here looking really gay.  I'm going to sound gay.  And I'm going to fucking intro the musical portion of the show.  The gay number.  The gay number.  I don't give a fuck what you think.  Where all the actors were just like, you know, if I got to watch Wolverine fucking prancing 
[00:16:00]  around on the stage one more goddamn time at these award shows like a sissy, like a sissy  fairy Mary.  You know what?  He's more that guy than Wolverine.  I know.  All right.  It's hilarious.  I think we all know that.  He's more that guy prancing around like he did last night.  Oh, prancing.  Than doing the fucking Wolverine.  Yeah.  What was up with Travolta's hair?  Well, he was wearing the nice head of hair hair, not the sharpied on, very thin cut. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  He wasn't wearing a velour head.  Jesus.  I didn't see this part, the musical portion.  Oh, boy.  Did you miss something that was terrific?  Did I miss something special?  Oh, it was amazing.  Very special.  I fucking hate musicals.  Yeah, man.  I really just can't do it.  It was so douchey.  I tried to watch Les Mis.  I got through 20 minutes.  I told you I liked the opening song.  The rest of it, I just thought stunk.  It stunk.  What was the problem?  Too much singing, right?  Yeah, it's just I didn't care about it at all.  Who's this dude?  Oh, Anne Hathaway. 
[00:17:00]  I really am attracted to Anne Hathaway.  Oh, my God.  What's wrong with you?  I know she cut her hair for a movie, but I mean, other actresses have cut all their hair  off and they still look sexy.  You like her in Batman?  She was really sexy.  She looked great in Batman.  And I told Anne this morning, I'm like, she was really sexy in Batman, but that's not  her.  This is her.  Were you ever singing?  I haven't heard any.  This was live last night?  Yeah.  Oh, that's bullshit.  And yet with you, my world has started.  Oh, God. 
[00:17:30]  What is this now?  Oh, do I hate Broadway?  Oh, God.  This is the worst.  Probably sucks a big, fat cock.  Exactly.  They all sing like songbirds, but who cares?  I don't care about their plight ever.  No.  Oh, the king told me that my hat was stolen.  Go fuck yourself.  Oh, now the big number.  The reason they all have plights is because they're walking through life singing. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Who the hell is that?  And all the actors are out there.  Where's Travolta?  He introed this whole thing.  Oh.  He's like, I go, Grease, like me.  Ugh.  Is that Russell Crowe?  And that fucking...  Oh, Russell Crowe.  You think he wants to be there singing?  The Borat came out?  He fought for that role.  And why is Borat? 
[00:18:30]  Borat's in Les Mis?  Was he?  Yeah.  Why was Borat in Les Mis?  Oh, no.  Why is the video clipping?  I don't know.  Is it us or their website?  Is their website getting just...  Even the interwebs doesn't want to fucking hear this shit.  Oh, that's like Fight Club.  She still looks like she's in Fight Club.  Why does she always have to look like Fight Club?  You're right.  She's never changed her look. 
[00:19:00]  What's her name?  Helena Bonham Carter.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Helena Bonham Carter.  The Fight Club broad.  Boy.  You look at fucking Russell Crowe and realize how long ago Gladiator was.  Yeah.  Damn.  Oh, he wanted this role badly.  I don't know.  He really, really wanted this.  You do this in high school.  He fought for it.  They didn't want him.  And the auditions were grueling.  But then the one takeaway everybody had was that Russell Crowe can't sing.  Right. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  He got killed for this.  Yeah, he did.  Oh, God.  Musicals.  My God.  I just can't.  I feel like I can't get them.  I wish I could get them.  And then they do sound editing.  And I mean, it was endless.  Screen adaption.  Hey.  What is that?  I like best foreign short animation.  I waited up all night for that one.  That's just people that are lazy or don't have enough to make a full fucking film.  Yeah.  But we make believe it's like something big.  Ugh. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  Coke Logic could have won that.  He's good at animation.  He certainly is.  And they're short.  What happened to Sweetie?  Chris is doing her at foot.  I'd love to worship it.  Oh, you didn't see her walk out?  No.  I kissed her little tootsies.  What happened?  Aw.  Yeah, she, uh...  You don't like her face?  She has a very interesting face.  I don't know what it is about her.  I think she's just too...  For me.  She's just...  She's too emo.  She always has an expression like Bill Clinton on her face. 
[00:20:30]  She looks like Clinton.  I don't know.  I'm depressed.  Yeah.  I don't know.  She fucking...  Yeah.  I thought Jessica Chastain got robbed for fucking Best Actress.  Who?  From Zero Dark Thirty.  Oh.  I thought she was by far the best.  Yeah.  Did you see the old movie Amore?  Anybody?  What was it called?  Amore.  Amore.  They kept showing the fucking old guys slapping the old lady.  Yeah.  Did you hear the audience?  Like, oh.  Man, none of them saw it.  Shut up. 
[00:21:00]  Fucking smother her.  Chris Brown somewhere is going, that's right.  That's what you do.  Yeah, motherfucker.  She...  She yet.  I think I'll watch that movie, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Amore or Amore?  Amore.  I'm going to go with Amore.  Amore.  What else?  What else?  What's her name there?  Fucking...  The telecast was three hours and 35 minutes, if anyone cares.  Jennifer Lawrence falling up the stairs.  Oh, right, right.  It was pretty good.  You always look for that in an Academy Award.  Yeah, you always look for someone falling. 
[00:21:30]  And she did.  She fucking fell flat down on the stairs.  That's why I like her.  With a dumb big dress.  Yeah, because she doesn't know how to fucking wear a dress like that.  You got to respect that.  Let's see.  Should we give the award to a true but completely fictionalized story about six hostages that  makes Hollywood the hero, or do we give it to the completely true and staying to the  truth story about the woman who hunts the fucking mastermind of 9-11, and then they 
[00:22:00]  show that torture actually had something to do with her.  Oh, well, that was a problem.  That was a problem.  Even though Argo was really good, but it was like...  I...  Fantasy.  Them fucking putting together the pictures and...  Stop it.  She just didn't happen.  She was definitely really good in Silver Lining Playbook, but that whole...  Yeah.  That whole dance angle was just stupid.  Oh, dude.  It's terrible.  I will not watch that.  Huh?  I will not watch Silver Lining Playbook.  Why?  It just seems like a fucking...  She did a nice job.  She's really hot in it, though.  It's worth watching for that. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  And De Niro was...  I can't watch De Niro.  He was average at best.  I am done with De Niro.  There was nothing special with his performance.  He wasn't up for anything, right?  Yeah, best supporting.  He was in the end.  Sure.  Oh, no.  No, not even close.  And I didn't even see any of the movies.  Who else was nominated for that?  Christoph Waltz was really great in Django.  He won.  Yeah.  Yeah, he won it.  Yep.  Who else?  Seymour Hoffman.  I didn't see that.  The master.  The master.  I didn't see that.  He was great, as you would expect it to be.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:23:00]  Much better than De Niro in that movie.  Yeah, I didn't think De Niro was terrible.  I didn't think he was great.  He was just De Niro being De Niro.  Yeah, he was all right.  Did you see Babs?  Well, we raided the singers before you got here, Sam Roberts.  Yeah.  Oh.  And you got to give it to Shirley Basie.  Yeah.  Why are you laughing?  Goldfinger.  It's easy to fucking make old jokes, but that broad fucking kicked ass and made the young  ones look a little stupid last night.  What did she say?  She sang Goldfinger. 
[00:23:30]  Goldfinger.  At 70, I think they said 78.  She sang it for the movie.  30, years ago.  Why did she sing it for the movie?  In the 60s.  They were doing a whole thing.  James Bond thing.  Yeah, it was a James Bond thing.  She came out and belted this thing out.  Did they get Connery there or no?  I don't think so.  No, it was kind of a montage-y thing.  Goldfinger.  Goldfinger.  He's the man.  He's the man.  The man with the mind is touched. 
[00:24:00]  A spider's touch.  She did the original.  It's crazy.  No auto-tuning.  Why is this clipping?  It's a computer.  It's a computer.  Our bad computer?  Yeah, it's this one.  Figures.  Wait, it's the computer we bitch about?  Yeah, it's this computer.  Of course it is.  I was watching the clips that you have in front of you are from the same website and they  don't clip, but I don't have the Goldfinger song.  Of course it is.  You don't have the Goldfinger song, huh?  Now, I thought this was very odd also. 
[00:24:30]  Apparently the orchestra was not even in the building.  What are you talking about?  I kind of got wind.  They didn't have room for the orchestra?  I thought the orchestra was at the Capitol Records building.  Is that what I heard?  Wow.  That's some technology right there.  Because, were they?  They showed that?  What?  What?  I can't understand you.  No, I wasn't listening at the time, but that's kind of what I thought.  I could be wrong.  But I didn't see an orchestra there. 
[00:25:00]  Is this the computer we bitch about?  They showed the orchestra wasn't there.  Okay.  All right.  But, like, why?  Why wasn't the orchestra there?  Made it in the room.  It's crazy.  Orchestras take up a lot of space.  Plus, the orchestra this year demanded to actually be in the front row seats playing,  and they said that will just wreck the video for everyone else.  I'll tell you why.  Too much room, and they don't need them for a lot of things these days.  It just seems like the orchestra is kind of a part of them in the orchestra pit. 
[00:25:30]  It sounds terrible.  What?  The way it's clipping like this is unlistenable.  It's unlistenable with the clipping.  Sam.  It's unlistenable.  Listen to that note.  How old is she?  78.  She's 41.  Oh, man.  She destroyed.  You can't tell from that clip because we have a bad computer that we really should bring  it up with the radio wizard so we can fix that.  In all fairness, we've never brought this up before to him, so we can't really bitch about 
[00:26:00]  it, right?  They put a new one in.  No, they took one of the shitty ones from somewhere else.  They just moved shitty equipment around.  Like, we were saying, we need a new computer here.  So they went, okay.  And then they take a broken one from somewhere else.  Well, in all fairness, it is new to this room.  See?  That's what I meant.  So technically, they obeyed orders.  I gotta say, Penn's Sunday School podcast I did.  They're all passing us by.  Oh, my God. 
[00:26:30]  It's a small studio.  It's just Penn.  It's in his house.  It looks like Penn's house.  And fucking, you get in there.  He's got like a little tech room with his guy.  And then they walk you in and you sit down.  And there's Penn and there's like three mics.  And there's a little camera on each of you.  Why cameras?  Just has it.  Why not?  It's just, you know, because we're in 2013.  Yeah, because everything should be fucking video.  And everyone has a camera.  Every show has a camera now.  Every podcast.  Not every show.  Podcasts. 
[00:27:00]  Podcasts are the future.  If we pick up our cell phones every once in a while, we could, you know, some shit.  Yeah.  It's fucking embarrassing.  I'm embarrassed every time I walk in and do a podcast at how much better their fucking setup is than ours.  Yeah, I did Rogan's podcast.  An amazing setup.  It's a fucking, it's like a 30 camera shoot.  Amazing.  The cameras.  Not only does he have cameras, they're really state-of-the-art, really nice cameras.  And then I did Bob Kelly's recently.  And his setup is pretty much as good as what we got.  Yeah. 
[00:27:30]  And he's just starting out.  Yeah.  All right.  Yep.  But at least fix our computer.  Can you do that?  Can they do that, Sam?  I don't.  We have a computer that clips.  And we like to, you know, go to that computer to play some stuff.  Mars, are they going to blame you?  No.  They won't blame you on this one?  We'll take our word for it.  Shirley Basie, whatever her name was, kicked ass last night.  Yeah.  You could count on her.  And then the Jennifer Hudson came out. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  I'm going to give her third place last night.  You got to give it to the old broad for the top spot.  She wasn't better than Jennifer Hudson.  Dude, you're so close-minded with your youth.  I mean, she was good.  You're so close-minded with your youth.  It's disgusting.  She was good for a 78-year-old.  No, she fucking was good for a singer.  But she wasn't as good as Jennifer Hudson was.  She blew Jennifer Hudson away.  There's no way.  Jennifer Hudson had a note that cracked.  You didn't notice that?  Jennifer Hudson was fantastic last night. 
[00:28:30]  No.  No.  What did Jennifer Hudson sing?  I didn't hear her.  No, Sam can't acknowledge that older people could actually be, you know, talented.  And creative.  Are you kidding me?  It wasn't even close.  Jennifer Hudson was better than the old.  Give me Jennifer Hudson.  You got the...  You should play the...  See, this is what...  Sam didn't even put her on the fucking disc.  She made no impact on my life.  Sam is ageist.  Huh?  He's ageist.  You're an ageist?  Oh, man.  Maybe.  What did you think of that broad's performance?  The old broad.  It was good, but it didn't blow me away. 
[00:29:00]  Why?  It just made very little impact.  It sounded very...  Well, it's supposed to sound like that.  That's the way she sang it back in the, like, 60s.  You didn't read his blog, Nerds to the Elderly?  Oh.  And I like Jennifer Hudson.  But Adele beat her, too, last night.  Yeah, Adele beat them all.  Adele beat her, Shirley beat her.  This is better than the old broad. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  I'm not feeling this one, even though she's...  She sounds good, but I don't like the style that she's singing in.  She's counter-walling.  Yeah, she is.  Shut up, you screechy bitch. 
[00:30:00]  Although, remind me to tell you, I saw one of the coolest things I've seen, which was inspired by this program.  Really?  That's right, I feel.  I'm not wanting to leave you.  That's love, I am.  I'm one.  And I am.  Tell me.  I had it with her.  Oh, she's good, though, man.  I don't know. 
[00:30:30]  You're the best thing I've ever...  What did Adele sing?  Skyfall.  Skyfall.  She sang a lot of them.  She sings like butter.  She was great, too.  Amy Winehouse, I still think, was much better than Adele.  Even though Adele was great.  Oh, my God.  Adele is...  Her voice is ridiculous, and it's effortless.  Yeah, I disagree with that.  Yeah, Amy Winehouse is good.  It was better.  Adele is...  It's just effortless, man.  It's unbelievable how she sings. 
[00:31:00]  She's very good. 
[00:31:30]  Hear my heart burst again, for this is the end.  I've drowned and dreamt this moment.  So overdue I owe them.  It's ridiculous.  Yeah.  Swept away on...  I still say fucking Amy killed her, but...  I like Winehouse. 
[00:32:00]  I like her.  But she's not interesting to me, even though she's got a great voice.  She's really good.  I mean, she's great, but she's not...  Amy Winehouse, I like just sitting there, all fucking hungover, belting out tunes with that scratchy voice.  I just thought about it.  But then Adele talks, and you can't believe it's the same person. 
[00:32:30]  Why?  What is it like?  I love...  Yeah!  I love...  We've done this bit.  Hey, you're dying.  I love...  You got it from the red carpet or something?  I'm trying to remember where I heard her last night.  She wasn't as bad when she was accepting her award.  Do you ever apologize to anyone after stepping on their foot?  If you want to listen to the old broad, I think it's not clipping in a different browser.  Well, just the end.  Give me the end when she fucking hits it out of the fucking car.  See, Sam's still trying to fight for Jennifer Hudson. 
[00:33:00]  No, I won't give you...  It's still clipping.  It's still clipping.  Enough of this.  It's climbing on the west.  Oh, crap.  I'd like to play this song.  A load of shite.  Let me give it some time to load.  Let's give it some time.  Crackle, crackle, crackle.  One more time.  Click, click, click, crackle.  What is giving it time going to do? 
[00:33:30]  Okay, it needs to load.  What?  That's a little tech talk for you guys.  Oh, it doesn't.  Yeah.  You know, my computer...  Like, I can barely see the screen because it's spiderwebbed.  I've dropped it a million times.  And my computer doesn't clip.  No, this doesn't happen.  My horrible laptop that I just refused to give up on doesn't clip.  It really is time.  Is it your MacBook?  Yeah.  I've dropped it a bunch of times.  You know, it's hard to see the screen sometimes.  And it's dirty.  I haven't cleaned it in over a year.  And it doesn't clip. 
[00:34:00]  What's the problem with this place?  Go, click, click, finger.  Click, click, crackle.  He's the man.  The man with the minus to click, click, click.  Fucking annoying.  It's fucking mind-boggling.  We've bitched about this computer a million times.  It's still clipping.  Of course it is.  That's today's issue.  Other days, it's, you know, the pages don't load. 
[00:34:30]  Jimmy, hang in there.  Then Jimmy does Penn's podcast.  It was beautiful, right?  It's literally, and I mean it, I'm literally embarrassed when I see what podcasts are doing.  I mean, it's fucking embarrassing when you see what these, like the idea of what we have here,  the audio and the freedom to say almost whatever we want, and just how they've just passed us.  A couple of small cameras up, it just feels like a more professional or better.  We don't have the freedom to do what we want anymore. 
[00:35:00]  Those guys have the freedom to do whatever they want.  We can talk about whatever we want.  And they've got a really nice kick-ass setup.  It's just embarrassing.  I'm sure we'll have the computer taken care of tomorrow, right?  They'll probably put in another one if we need it.  Yeah.  Well, I was looking into it, okay?  But then the cost was too much, so we've got to reassess.  I heard about the wall, by the way.  My wife goes, you guys are doing a bus tour? 
[00:35:30]  Wait, I heard you heard about the wall?  Wait, what wall?  This wall.  Oh, I forgot about that already.  What happened?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  I heard we were going to talk about it in a couple weeks, but that has passed us by.  Here's what I heard probably two weeks ago.  Yeah, the engineering put in a proposal, and it cost a lot of money.  So they were told to, you know, look again, and we'll get back to you on it.  Oh, no.  Goat, finger, click, click, crackle, click. 
[00:36:00]  I forgot about the wall already.  Yeah.  They beat me down.  I'm past that.  Yes.  When we sat down with Bladder, he goes, well, we'll have another discussion about it in two weeks.  I'm like, what are we discussing?  Are we moving the wall or not?  How hard is this?  Discussions.  Why does everything have to be discussed?  It's a simple thing.  Are we moving the wall or not?  Nope.  No.  And then Greenstein, I went to him, and I said, look, we want the wall moved to right about. 
[00:36:30]  He goes, I could give you to right about here.  I go, perfect.  Look, you know, we'd like the whole space behind us, but if you're willing to give us a little taste, that would certainly help us.  He goes, all right, no problem.  Consider it done.  Consider it done.  Consider it done.  Well, is it?  And what, that's their excuse this time?  Too expensive?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They have to rework the numbers.  Really?  Because engineering must have come in and said, all right, we're going to do this, this, this, this, this. 
[00:37:00]  Why is it not too expensive when they do a one-and-done, like, party slash event, and they fly in the original disco ball from Studio 54?  Do you know what?  That Studio 54 party costs unbelievable millions of dollars.  Everyone has forgotten about it.  The only reason you know about it is because we're bringing it up.  They had this one-and-done amazing fucking party.  Everyone that went to the Super Bowl, like, that's just a one-and-done.  Right, so don't tell me how expensive it is.  Yeah.  These guys throw money around like it's nothing. 
[00:37:30]  They flew in the original moon-doing-coke thing that hung from the ceiling.  Right, right.  The moon and the spoon.  Yeah, that needed its own fucking airplane.  You can't fold that shit up.  No way.  And here we are.  Well, they, yeah, cost a little too much, so they're going to rework it again.  Oh, my God.  What?  What?  What, are they going to take a Sawzall and make a hole that we have to crawl through?  Mud.  That's it.  Mud.  Mud.  Stuck in the mud.  Oh.  That's what it is. 
[00:38:00]  That's what it is.  Yeah.  Stuck in the mud.  You can see the edge, and we just can't get there.  I interrupted you.  I apologize, but my wife goes, are you guys doing a bus tour?  I go, oh, yeah, I didn't mention it to you, because I just figured it would fall.  Because it'll fall apart.  It'll fall apart.  Yeah, yeah.  You didn't tell your family because you figured it's not going to happen anyway?  Yeah, she's cool and all, but she's like, wait, so you guys are going to be broadcast  for over a week on the road?  I'm like, ah, I didn't bring it up, because it's like everything else over there. 
[00:38:30]  There's a real conversation I had, by the way, because everything just falls apart.  It'll fall apart.  Everything falls apart.  That's why I didn't bring it up with you, so we could start planning, because I do have  two little kids, so it would be important to get some coverage, but I'm like, ah.  You have that little faith.  No.  Wow, and people are all excited on Twitter all weekend long, and I'm just reading these  tweets going, I'll never meet you.  I'm sorry.  Because they're like, well, if you're going to Nashville, I'm driving three hours to meet  you guys.  I'm like, ah, well, that ain't happening.  I wouldn't put in for the days. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  When do they say it's going to happen?  Oh, it's that vagary.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A lot of vagary.  Sometime.  And this is what's going to, mark my word on this, and I hate to play my hand.  I wish I could just write this and put it in an envelope instead of saying it on the  air, because they're going to be on to me.  Uh-huh.  But mark my, ah, fuck, should we do it?  Oh, my God.  It don't matter.  Oh, my God.  Uh, they're going to go, they're going to go one or the other.  What do you mean?  That's going to be their new thing.  One or the other.  Bus tour or move the wall. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, God.  You think they're going to do that to us?  They like doing that, too.  And, by the way, the bus tour thing, as it sits now, what they're talking about is two  buses that we're going to, like, travel with in tandem there and, uh, you know, go to  various cities and stuff.  Then, obviously, they're going to cut it down to one bus.  I ain't doing one bus.  Then they're going to cut it down to, like, one of those party buses to go to, like, fucking 
[00:40:00]  Jersey.  Right.  Yeah, you guys want to do something at the Short Hills Mall in the parking lot?  That's what it's going to, that's what it'll end up being.  Yeah.  And then when we say no, they'll be like, oh, there's another event that they turned down.  But it's like, no, we wanted to do this.  Click, click, click, click, click, click.  Everybody, everybody piled into the wrapped Sirius XM SUV that does sticker stops and stuff.  There it is.  Oh, I told the wife.  Ah, yeah.  I didn't bring it up because, you know.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  Why bring up something that's not going to happen?  That's a real lack of faith because that's, I mean. 
[00:40:30]  Yep.  Ah, well, you know.  To not tell the people in your house that this is happening means you don't think it's  going to happen.  We put the sign on the door years ago, Sam.  Read it for everybody.  It says, don't go home with hope.  It's still there.  Yeah.  Certainly is.  All right, well.  So, no wall moved.  Maybe a bus door.  And an old computer.  And a lot of clicks.  And a lot of clicks. 
[00:41:00]  Clicking, clicking.  That's today's issues.  Really?  Yes.  The wall's not moving?  All in all.  I don't know.  They, you know, I don't know.  I don't know.  I would love to know the other things they've done with their money around here.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, Oprah's fucking buffet alone every time she comes here once a year.  Yeah.  They pay for a guy that we've never seen.  Eminem.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, he gets lots of money, I'm sure.  For Shade 45. 
[00:41:30]  It's branding.  How about you tell, you know, Eminem to beat it?  You got the Who Kid.  He could fucking turn into the Who Kid fucking channel.  It'd be just as popular.  Why are you paying a guy not to show up?  I don't get it.  You don't think, you think people would stop subscribing because it's not called Eminem's  channel anymore?  Oh, boy.  That's gotta be, I would guess they're paying Eminem well over a million dollars to not show  up.  A year?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  For that name?  Fuck, yeah. 
[00:42:00]  I think easily a million dollars for a guy that doesn't even show up.  When they try to interview him, when they're even close to him, it's a hassle.  And he just gets that check in the mail, like, oh, what's this for?  Oh, yeah.  He doesn't even know he's part of this.  What is that?  Why do I have a check from SiriusX?  Yeah, his people made the deal.  He doesn't even know he's part of this.  I would bet money he doesn't know he's part of this.  Wait, they didn't, wait, when he was in the, when he was doing Yankee Stadium, they  got him for a little bit, right?  A couple minutes, I think. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, but I think a couple minutes.  Did Jamie Foxx do anything for the Oscars?  I mean, he might have.  I don't know.  No.  Not from the Oscars.  Jamie Foxx.  I mean, no, not from the Oscars, but I mean.  I don't know what it is about him.  I don't like him either, man.  I don't like Jamie Foxx at all.  I want to like him, but it's kind of difficult.  I don't know what it is.  I can't put my finger on the butt.  Apparently SiriusXM put out this memo thing or something because he was going to have  some big interview with Trayvon Martin's family or some shit, and they're like, oh, tune  into this.  It's very important. 
[00:43:00]  Fuck you.  Fuck Jamie Foxx.  Fuck these guys for fucking kowtowing to this bullshit.  How about we have fucking a wall moved?  How about we have a fucking wall moved?  I was wondering if I was going to get back to you.  What?  I got the press release and the, you know, because.  Dude, of course it gets back to me.  Like, I fucking give a flying fuck.  That's nice language.  If, you know, the fuck.  That's ridiculous.  How about we get fucking George Zimmerman's fucking brother on here to talk about the other 
[00:43:30]  side of it and have SiriusXM put out this all-important memo that makes it sound like everyone supports  it?  I don't support the idea of Jamie Foxx and Trayvon Martin's family deciding what a trial  is supposed to decide anyway.  Enough.  Douchebag.  And Jamie Foxx is a self-important shithead.  Fuck him.  Fuck him. 
[00:44:00]  You're not a fucking musical fucking genius.  You're acting as fucking average at best.  You hear me now?  I'm over there.  I like that song.  You know what I was watching last night, which was amazing, by the way?  Your dick?  No, I said amazing, not non-functioning and sick.  And sick, didn't you say that?  Jesus.  What were you watching?  I got it from here, watching the Pavarotti, Simon and the Bond thing.  And I just was talking to somebody about opera yesterday, so I'm like, fuck it, I'm going 
[00:44:30]  to watch a little Pavarotti.  And I got in one of those loops, and he did a bunch of shit with other artists.  I didn't realize that.  Yeah.  And I was watching Pavarotti with Bryan Adams, and then Pavarotti with James Brown, and  they sang It's a Man's World.  Really?  Holy fuck.  The Man's World.  It was fucking amazing.  Well, let's play that, Sam, today for everybody, please.  Pavarotti.  And James Brown.  And James Brown.  And James Brown, you know how he was so wild when he sang?  Yeah.  But he was really focused. 
[00:45:00]  Kept it together.  Yeah, and he was great.  And I've never been a big James Brown fan, but he was fucking...  I kind of like some of the James Brown stuff.  This is a Man's World.  This isn't clippin'.  Packed house.  Maybe it is the fucking Oscar site.  This is a Man's World.  Yeah, why is this clicking?  Holy fuck.  Oh my God, Pavarotti looks ridiculous.  He's sitting.  Oh no, he's sitting.  But it wouldn't be nothing.  He's not.  Nothing.  Nothing.  He's really singing here. 
[00:45:30]  Oh yeah, he's really on fucking point.  Fucking James Brown.  You see, man made the car.  The chick is over the road.  James Brown looked like a hoochie bar in the sun.  He's a little sweat.  Jesus.  Not bad.  When does a fat man sing? 
[00:46:00]  When he wants to.  He always takes the second verse.  That's right.  That's true.  He like lets every other singer do their thing.  And then he's like, that's kind of cute.  Yeah, that's adorable.  Watch those.  Whoa.  He basically tells these guys, give it your best, man.  Try to take me out.  James Brown is good though, man.  Yeah, he's kicking it.  Yeah, he sounds great right there.  I like this song too.  Oh. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, Pavarotti.  Oh boy.  Does he even need a microphone?  Motherfucker.  Jesus.  His eyebrows look like when fucking Elaine drew in Uncle Leo's eyebrows in the doctor's office.  That one I know. 
[00:47:00]  They're like Sharpie.  I know that one.  Why are you angry?  Fuck.  Are you kidding me?  And his range is amazing, like for operas.  James Brown's like smiling.  Respect right there.  Yeah. 
[00:47:30]  All right.  It's adorable.  I was watching another Pavarotti thing where it was called Pavarotti like the master classes  where he teaches people who can sing opera.  He kind of, it was like a reality show.  Really?  Wow.  Really?  And there's this one guy comes out and just belts out a fucking tune.  Really?  And then Pavarotti's very nice, but he's speaking in broken English and he's showing the guy  what he did wrong.  Oh.  But he's telling him like, no, you got to keep your mouth a certain way. 
[00:48:00]  Like Edgar?  You just made Edgar's mouth.  Not quite as bad as Edgar.  But there's such a fucking, to belt that shit out.  Yeah.  Your body.  I talk about opera singer.  Opera's like an odd fucking style of singing.  I was talking about not moving.  Yeah.  And she said they don't move because your tone and everything changes when you move.  So you just stay steady and you do something with your lungs.  That's why fat guys are good at it.  Like rock singers have to fucking like twist their necks around and fucking bend.  I'm sitting.  How about he sitting? 
[00:48:30]  He's singing like that sitting down.  He's sitting on a stool.  He's probably shitting.  It's on that famous toilet of his on stage.  Spend so much time in the toilet.  He gets some singing done every day, right?  Old fat back, belt in one out.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  Was the Joe Brown great in that, though?  Yeah.  That is pretty good.  He was a classic.  Oh, all right.  And then finally Barbra Streisand came out.  Pomp is Barbra Streisand, who probably told the Academy, if I'm going to sing for you  guys, I'm going to sing last because obviously I'm the best. 
[00:49:00]  Right?  Anyone else get that fucking vibe?  Of course.  She thought she was going to really close this thing.  And she was the worst of the night.  By far.  I think.  I don't really know that world, but I have ears.  Yeah.  Maybe.  I don't know if she was the worst thing.  Yeah.  She's probably on like Catherine Zeta-Jones level.  Wait.  Who do you think?  No, I'm just talking about the high profile singing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Then she was definitely the worst.  Definitely.  Yeah.  What'd she sing?  She sang to the, how do you say his name? 
[00:49:30]  Hamlish?  Marvin Hamlish.  Marvin Hamlish passed?  The way we were.  The way we were.  So she came out and did that, but she had to talk?  Why?  She, why was she talking all of a sudden?  But look, I just, I cut off most of the talking, but I kept on the part where she organically  goes from talking to singing.  Oh, that was a douche chill.  Oh, no.  Marvin left us way too soon.  Marvin left us.  But I'll always have those wonderful, wonderful. 
[00:50:00]  Jimmy just throws the mic away.  I know.  That wasn't.  I'll always have those wonderful, wonderful.  Wonderful what?  Wonderful what?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Oh, that reminded me of, like, Gervais in the office.  Yeah, that's pretty bad, right?  And it was like she was just speaking from the heart about her friend who passed away.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Uh-huh.  Marvin left us way too soon.  But I'll always have those wonderful, wonderful memories. 
[00:50:30]  Like the corner of my mind.  Missed the water called memories of the way we were scared of pictures.  That's the only way I sing this song.  Missed the water, smile gave to one another.  That's all I think about with this song.  The mom crying on the other end of the phone.  Yeah, of course.  Got a picture.  That's how I expect the note to come in.  I know.  Yeah, I'm singing it, right?  John Lovitz looking at the corner.  What's he doing? 
[00:51:00]  Exactly.  Smiles we left behind.  Behind.  Smiles we gave to one another.  It's all right.  Yeah, I know.  It's Babs.  But it was, like, minutes after Adele and Jennifer Hudson.  Yeah.  And the old broad.  Here comes the bitch.  Can it be that it was all so similar?  You combed your old broad before I did.  Oh, has time rewritten every line? 
[00:51:30]  If we had the chance to do it all day.  You know who looked good?  I don't like the way she looks.  And she's just frozen in time.  Jane Fonda.  Jane Fonda looked exactly like the Jane Fonda of, like, the 80s.  Yeah, she's...  Yeah, she kind of stopped aging, or she got, like, a...  A Jane Fonda mask or a lot of work done?  Yeah.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's all right.  I mean, I am not a big fan.  I'm not fond of Hanoi Jane. 
[00:52:00]  Would you smell her ass?  Ew.  After she does one of those Jane Fonda workouts.  Only if it was on her fingers when I kissed her hand.  I told you the I'm not fond of Jane urinal fucking cakes I used to pee on at the White  Rose Hamburger System in Edison, New Jersey, which is by the best late night fucking burgers  ever is in Edison, New Jersey.  Or is it Highland Park?  I don't know.  But you'd piss, and it had the fucking Jane...  I'm not fond of Jane...  Nice.  ...a urinal sticker.  I'm not fond of Jane. 
[00:52:30]  Love a good urinal sticker.  She dressed in yellow, huh?  Yeah.  That's a weird color.  I have a pie one for best director.  No, it won most awards.  Best director, cinematographer, most awards.  But I don't understand, because it's like, wasn't it just on a boat with a CGI tiger?  It was all CGI'd.  What the fuck?  How does a director win that?  Yeah, and then...  That's pretty fucking stupid.  And then Affleck there doesn't get even nominated.  That's...  He didn't get nominated for best director? 
[00:53:00]  Nope.  No.  Even though it won best picture, and he lost his mind up there.  Even though he had director beard.  Do we have his...  That's weird.  His, uh, acceptance speech?  Is that fun?  Yeah, they basically said Argo is the best picture in spite of Ben Affleck's direction.  Oh, shit.  That's odd to not get nominated.  He must have did something to somebody out there.  It's a Holly...  No, it's a Hollywood rewarding themselves.  That's all that movie is.  Some guy got some of the new designs from the Unicorn Apocalypse game.  Oh, God.  That was a Tim Burton commercial.  And I can't promise that it's not gonna click. 
[00:53:30]  Click!  Clickety-clack!  Now, this one's not gonna click.  You clickety-clack bitch.  I don't think it's gonna click.  I'm closing deals with clients and watching the game.  Maybe it is the Oscars site.  Is it?  Do you think it's the Oscars site?  Is it clicking?  It is not.  Going through.  What?  Because we have to watch the commercial first.  I think everybody's downloading for their various morning shows. 
[00:54:00]  Maybe that's what it is.  Yeah, this is a Ben Affleck interview.  Oh, boy.  Now playing.  This nominee has a producer of Argo.  You may have heard of him.  Oh, that's the dude that used to be on MTV.  Hey, Anthony.  I didn't know you produced Argo.  How'd he hear that?  Why?  Which guy looks like you?  It's that guy that was in fucking True Lies.  Apparently, he's a fucking big producer now.  But I got that.  Hey, Anthony.  I didn't know. 
[00:54:30]  Shut the fuck up.  Oh, God.  Fuck.  Yeah, that guy.  That guy is fucking.  Yeah, he was in True Lies.  Here we go.  I want to thank them.  And I want to thank what they taught me, which is that you have to work harder than you think  you possibly can. 
[00:55:00]  You can't hold grudges.  It's hard.  You can't hold grudges.  Yeah, what else?  And it doesn't matter how you get knocked down in life, because that's going to happen.  All that matters is that you've got to get up.  Violet, Sam, and Sarah, I love you.  Is he, like, losing it?  Yeah, he's about to cry.  He was fucking.  But how did he get knocked down?  He's had a great career.  I guess, you know.  You fucked Jennifer Lopez.  You've won two Oscars.  Maybe Gigli and Pearl Harbor.  He got knocked down for those. 
[00:55:30]  He had a great career.  Yeah, he started out as a kid.  It's not like, you know, he's getting all fucking busted up there.  But it's not like he had bad knees or anything.  Oh.  You know?  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  18 years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio with two very bad knees.  Yeah.  What else?  In a dream to become a Major League Baseball player.  Wow.  Oh, God.  I wonder what happened.  Why don't we ever hear what happened?  I don't know.  He just walks away.  Did it come true?  I beg God, the dream came true. 
[00:56:00]  Yay!  All right, old pissy eye.  Oh, good for you.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Iraq, what did you think of the Oscars?  I saw that you were tweeting last night.  Give us your thoughts.  I fell asleep around 1030.  Oh.  It was just too long.  Yeah.  Too boring.  It was very boring.  It's always boring.  Every year we watch thinking it's going to be something, and it always is just there.  That's what it is.  Like, I don't know why people expect anything different.  That's what it is.  Oh, my God.  He's got a flying non-outfit on.  You didn't see this?  I missed the whole beginning. 
[00:56:30]  This sketch was all right, man.  Was it nice?  Sally Field is a good sport doing it.  He should have goofed on her about the Boniva.  Yeah, but out of respect, I think I have to.  Look, I got a bottle of wine and some Boniva.  We'll have a great time.  Oh, he did.  Do you have to give it to Helen?  They're not going to give it to Helen.  Amy.  I don't know who that is.  Jackie.  No.  I'm not going to give it to him.  Yeah.  He's making out with Sally Field.  He made a Boniva joke.  That's pretty good.  Yeah, he did.  Yeah.  It was a good skit, I'm telling you.  And then they took off in a Trans Am, smoking the Bandit Star. 
[00:57:00]  Ah.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's pretty funny.  That he belted her in the cheek.  It was definitely a funny bit, I thought.  That Bert.  He sure loved belting broads.  I'll tell you one thing.  Bert, when Bert said shut up, he meant shut up.  Not to tell him twice.  It wasn't open for discussion.  No, it certainly wasn't.  Oh, man.  Shut the fuck up.  If Bert wanted to hear the TV, he wanted to hear the TV.  End of discussion.  Ha!  Ah, yeah.  And Roland lost a bet with me.  Roland, I don't know what he was thinking, but he guaranteed that Wolverine would win 
[00:57:30]  Best Actor.  Oh, right.  For Les Mis.  He was insisting that Wolverine would beat Daniel Day-Lewis.  Or as fucking John Travolta said it, Les Mis here are blasey, Josh.  The fuck was he trying to do?  Daniel Day-Lewis won Best Actor for the third time.  That's a record?  Only time, yep.  Nobody's ever done that.  What about Tom Hanks?  Twice.  Really?  Yeah, Philadelphia and Gum.  Never again.  He was nominated for a...  He was nominated a bunch of other times, right? 
[00:58:00]  No, just once, I think.  What was it?  Danny Day-Lewis win for?  He won for this, obviously.  My Left Foot?  There Will Be Blood in this.  There Will Be Blood?  In this.  In this.  All different roles, too, man.  I liked him in that fucking Five Points movie there.  What was that?  Gangs of New York.  Last of the Mohicans.  That was good.  Yeah.  Gangs of New York.  What do you guys think of the tie they had last night?  For sound editing, was it?  Oh, look out.  What was that?  They had a tie.  You can't figure out which sound was better? 
[00:58:30]  So stupid.  No, it's a tie.  If you're going to waste your time and do, like, a tie, make it on a category that counts  so people will talk about it.  Yeah, maybe if it was for Best Actor or something, you can't fuck around with it.  But if it's a tie, then go, all right, look, we got five of us in the room.  Let's just fucking pick one of these.  Just do it alphabetically.  No one else is going to give a fuck.  What an inconvenient hat Lincoln had.  That thing's just inconvenient.  Yeah.  Like when he walked into a room and had to take it off and put it somewhere, it now dominates  the room.  His dumb hat. 
[00:59:00]  It's on a table or a fucking desk.  It's this giant dumb hat.  Did he drink coffee?  He would stand on it.  What did he do?  He would stand in his hat and he would toboggan in his hat standing.  That's how he campaigned.  Why did it take so long for them to figure out the hat?  I don't know.  The hat.  The hat.  Did other guys wear that type of hat or was he the only one that wore that hat?  I think they always probably did.  It's just dumb.  I think he was the tail end of that hat.  It was windy back then, right? 
[00:59:30]  Like that tall of a hat.  Because I know they still had the top hat, but it was a lot shorter when Kennedy wore it.  Well, I'll tell you what it was.  Is that hat with the big selling point for that hat was it will stop a bullet in its tracks.  And that just kind of wrecked their marketing campaign.  It's just a dumb hat to wear.  It's just so dumb.  Like you can't put it anywhere without it just being, you know, the center of attention.  Why?  Why would you wear that?  It's in there.  It's a bucket. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  And those are short.  Those are short fucking hats compared to Lincoln's.  But someone has to explain why that hat.  And put it this way.  Lincoln was a very tall guy anyway.  And then he put that hat on him.  He couldn't have been able to walk through doorways with that.  How tall was he?  Six.  Six, probably.  Was he that tall?  Yeah.  He was a tall drink of water.  When they shot him in the noggin there, when John Wilkes Booth shot him, they brought him  up to that boarding house across the street.  And they had to put him diagonally in the bed.  That's right.  Because he couldn't fit on the fucking bed. 
[01:00:30]  Very tall gentleman.  And someone on Twitter saying that Lincoln absolutely had a bodyguard that day.  And the guy went for a drink.  Well, yeah.  He did have bodyguards.  But, I mean, watch the one fucking door go into the box that he's in.  For the love of Christ.  What the fuck are you doing?  One door.  Into his box.  That was your whole job.  Yeah.  And you went and got a drink?  Yeah.  How thirsty are you?  Crazy.  What else about the Oscars? 
[01:01:00]  So, we had the tie in Best Sound Editing.  First time in 18 years.  Thrilling.  That was that amazing Mark Wahlberg TED segment.  That was fantastic, wasn't it?  Huh?  What?  Huh?  That didn't seem forced at all.  Wow.  I hate when they do those fucking pre-tapes.  What?  They came out and they were kind of riffing on the audience and stuff.  It was good.  Pre-taped, obviously.  Pre-taped?  Really?  Yeah, you can't have a CGI thing come out and hop on a stool and start yapping.  What do you mean? 
[01:01:30]  I thought it was just a midget.  It's like when Beavis and Butthead would come out.  Oh.  In the old days.  You know, obviously they can't do that.  They're not real.  Do you not like it?  No.  I know.  I didn't.  And Mark Wahlberg's not being Mark Wahlberg.  He's being, like, half the character.  He's being the character.  It's because he's talking to fucking Ted.  It's a fake movie.  It's fake.  Can I see it?  I didn't see it.  That was good.  I think you're going to like this one.  So, Ted, how you click, clickety-clack. 
[01:02:00]  You can't play the clips.  Are you annoyed by the clicks?  I hate the clickety-clacks.  Why?  Because they're so annoying.  It takes you right out of it.  No, we'll find a clip that's not clicking.  Just for you.  Pinks.  Just for you.  Here it is.  See, right here.  Oh.  Yeah, we got it.  There we go.  Ted presents sound awards at Oscars.  Uh-huh. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, boy.  Trying to play.  You know.  What are you doing?  I just.  All right.  We'll try.  We'll find another version.  Is that our site or is that our computer or the site?  We can't keep blaming.  Good is in every blue diamond almond.  I love a blue diamond almond, to be very honest.  I just like almonds.  Smokehouse almonds.  Fuck them.  They gave me the worst shits, but they're amazing.  I like to lick them and smell them and then eat them.  That's great.  Salt off my fingers like a deer. 
[01:03:00]  Please welcome the stars of my mediocre effort, Mark Wahlberg and Ted.  See, look.  He's walking out, but he's a stuffed bear.  He can't walk.  Is that a drunk joke or a short joke?  Not sure.  I don't know, yeah. 
[01:03:30]  There it is.  Oh, boy.  I think your imagination's gotten out of control, dude.  Look, come on, you guys.  I'm really good at sex, and I can bring sodas and snacks and soap and stuff.  Please.  Hilarious.  All right, it's at Jack Nicholson's house.  Ah, yes.  All right.  Oh, boy, this is pretty cool. 
[01:04:00]  You and me at the Academy Awards.  This is insane, dude.  Look at all this talent.  All this talent in one spot.  There's Daniel Day-Lewis.  There's Alan Arkin.  There's Joaquin Phoenix.  And you know what's interesting?  All those actors I just named are part Jewish.  Oh, okay.  What about you?  You got a Berg on the end of your name.  Are you Jewish?  Am I Jewish?  No, actually, I'm Catholic.  Wrong answer.  Try again.  What?  You want to work in this town, or don't you?  Fucking Jews. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, shit, Chip.  No, you're not.  This is terrible.  I was born Theodore Shapiro, and I would like to donate money to Israel and continue to work in Hollywood forever.  Thank you.  I am Jewish.  You're an idiot.  Yeah, well, we'll see who the idiot is when they give me my private plane at the next secret synagogue meeting.  Look, I'm not doing a sequel with you, okay?  Fuck it.  Ted, don't joke fuck around.  That was awful.  That was really bad.  Why?  It can't be awful. 
[01:05:00]  It was in front of a billion people.  Oh.  That must be awful when a bit is...  It's just bums.  ...and you can't acknowledge it.  Not the worst bit of the night.  What was the worst bit of the night?  Melissa McCarthy.  Can you find that?  I saw part of it.  I didn't hear the whole thing.  People are talking, man.  I didn't see that one.  And I think Melissa McCarthy's hilarious.  I really do.  I like Paul Rudd, too.  I just didn't like...  I don't like Paul Rudd.  Yeah, I like Paul.  I don't like him.  Do you know him?  No.  We've met once, but I don't know him.  I don't think he's as they say all that. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, Jesus.  Not a fan of Paul Rudd.  Click, click, or not fucking load.  What do we get this time?  All right.  Paul Rudd and Melissa McCarthy.  No, bullshit.  Hear it.  What?  Oh, it wasn't it?  It's one of those bullshit ones where there's a screen grab.  It's the bullshit one.  It's got you to go to a website that...  Oh, but something else is happening.  That's right.  Same one.  Come here and look at our ad for Bisquick or whatever it is. 
[01:06:00]  Bisquick.  Old lady who can't improv.  Go ahead.  Come here and look at our thing for whatever.  I don't know if we have that just yet.  Well, we don't have that bit.  Not just yet.  But everyone hated it, so...  Yeah, it's got to be somewhere.  Well, we can take a break and figure it out.  We don't...  Maybe we won't even play it.  I don't know.  Who knows?  Who the fuck knows, man?  All right.  I think that's it for Oscars.  Uh-huh.  For the Oscars. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, that about covers the wonderful Oscars.  He is nominated as a producer of Argo.  You may have heard of him.  That...  Oh, that...  That's the same guy.  From MTV.  I remember him from MTV.  Mm-hmm.  Was Clooney...  Clooney was involved with fucking Argo, right?  Yeah, he was a producer.  Producer also?  He produced the Argo.  Mm-hmm.  He's with that piece of ass.  Keebler.  Keebler.  He's with the Keeps.  Yeah.  She is fucking gorgeous. 
[01:07:00]  She was probably the hottest woman there.  You think?  Oh, my God.  Pick one that was hotter.  Let me see a picture of her.  Kristen Stewart.  Pick one that was hotter than Keeps.  Is that what you call her?  Yeah, man.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Stacey Keebler.  Let's see.  Oh.  Yeah, she looks pretty good.  Yeah, she's fine.  That's what she wore last night, though?  Yep.  That's kind of sporty.  Big elfin ears.  She does Keeps.  Keeps.  Keeps.  Keeps.  Keeps.  Keeps.  Yeah. 
[01:07:30]  Well, who was hotter?  Legs for days.  I don't know.  Kristen Stewart.  You know who ain't looking all that good?  Jennifer Aniston.  Beat you to it.  No.  I wasn't going to say her, but...  Jennifer Aniston's Botox-y right now.  She's still Botox-y.  She's all Botox-ed out?  She's Botox-y.  She went too far with the stupid Botox.  I was going to say...  What's her name?  Oh, fuck.  South African woman hair.  Betsy Turtledge?  They're on.  Yes.  Charlene.  I thought she looked amazing. 
[01:08:00]  What?  Oh, I loved her last night.  She looked good.  I'm not a fan of the boy haircut.  But she's looked better.  But they all say how she could pull it off because she has the perfect face and features.  I'm not a fan of the boy haircut.  Dude, I love her.  You don't?  I like it on boys.  Yeah.  She is beautiful, but...  God, is she fucking great.  I wouldn't mind hugging and kissing her and watching the sun come up.  Really?  Oh.  I don't know.  That boy haircut's a little rough. 
[01:08:30]  I know.  Why do they all of a sudden say I liked her or I liked Anne Hathaway and they both have  short boy haircuts?  Yes.  Oh, no.  Uh-oh.  She's hotter than the Keebs, I guess.  Even with the short hair, right?  Got to give it to Theron.  Charlize Theron.  Charlize.  Charlize.  I'm still mad at Sam.  Why?  Because I didn't think the 007 lady was as good as Jennifer Hudson?  Yeah.  You're closed-minded, I think.  I didn't say she was bad.  She was very good, especially for 78, but she wasn't as good as... 
[01:09:00]  Goldfinger!  Why would you think the guy that only eats four foods is closed-minded?  She wasn't as good.  He had to go with The Happening Broad, but sometimes The Happening Broad isn't the best  in the room there, Sam Roberts.  Jennifer Hudson's not even that happening anymore.  No, she's not.  She doesn't put out any real songs other than The Dream.  She's still singing the Dream Girl song.  Yeah, exactly.  It's her only song.  But she did it better than the 007 lady.  You guys sound like a bunch of homos except Jimmy. 
[01:09:30]  Thanks.  Talking about the Oscars.  Isn't that ironic?  How I was just going to say that, but I had eggs in my mouth.  Marky.  Who's?  See, balls, I don't know.  Marky.  Hey, what's up, guys?  You do sound like a bunch of fruitcakes this morning.  Come on, man.  Talk about something else.  Look at this regular guy.  Talk about something else, huh?  At least he's not playing a character.  Oh, forget about it.  Come on.  Yeah, we're a bunch of faggots in here.  Look at your standing up comedy, man.  You rock.  Thank you.  Hey, you know, what do I know?  I go to the movies. 
[01:10:00]  I watch the movies.  It's over for me.  Go ahead.  That's what this guy is.  What do I know?  God.  He is.  It's one of these guys.  You know how many of these guys I worked with?  Ugh.  He hung up, too.  Good.  A bunch of fancy, schmancy people.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Give yourself the award.  What the hell do I know?  I don't need to see it.  That's regular Joe.  You give me a container of coffee.  I watch the movie.  I go home.  It's over for me.  Yes.  Hey, where's my award, huh?  I'm the best guy on the job site.  You don't see that.  Ah, what the hell?  What do I know?  Best guy on the job.  What do I know?  I don't think we had a choice. 
[01:10:30]  If a billion people watch something, you better talk about that the next day.  Right.  That's how I look at it.  And it should talk about what the union electricians did on that fucking stage, let me tell you.  Yeah.  Not right.  Yeah, you want to talk about something?  What do I know?  You're all man.  Talk about guys that don't get to work on time and still want the same pay.  What the hell do I know?  Ah, the whole world's crazy.  That guy.  All right, we're going to break, so I hope Mark's cool with that.  But no more Oscar talk. 
[01:11:00]  Unless we find the Melissa McCarthy, because that was so uncomfortably bad.  I want to see that.  You do want to see that?  You didn't see it?  I didn't see it.  Yeah, I think it might be worth playing.  Yeah.  It was a stinkeroo.  Mm-hmm.  All right, Iraq, what do you got?  Something good?  First of all, is somebody going to the bathroom this break?  I'm debating.  I piss every time.  I want to see what Kenny does after what happened.  Go ahead and go.  And then have a full report.  Oh, I don't really have to go. 
[01:11:30]  Go for the fake bathroom run.  I want it to be authentic.  I'm going to take you fucking piss.  I'm going to take you fucking piss.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.'s.  Fuck you.  Yeah, here's one for you guys.  Another day of fucking hole-smoking, guy-on-guy action.  What the hell happened to the Opie and Anthony show?  Remember the good old days when we had tits and bush? 
[01:12:00]  And hey, how about that wow sticker thing?  We saw boobs.  Not anymore.  It's all gay, gay, so gay.  Holy shit.  I love you guys, but F.U.  Fuck you.  This F.U. goes out to Jimmy, you fucker.  When you said dude's nipples, daddy wants to nurse.  I spewed milk and apple pie all over the dash of my truck.  So, fuck you, Norton. 
[01:12:30]  You're hilarious.  Fuck you.  This fuck you goes out to the emergency broadcast system.  Every time I hear,  I get excited thinking I'll never have to work my lousy job ever again.  I run for my gun, but then I hear,  it's just a test.  Fuck you, emergency broadcast system.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I'd like to say fuck you to the Russian punk band Pussy Riot  for fucking up my search results on Google Image Search  from here to the rest of eternity. 
[01:13:00]  Fuck you.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck these stupid weather channels  and these stupid fucking newscasters  that embellish the news.  They've been born with fucking rose-colored glasses,  never fucking lived outside of fucking Manhattan  or their pre-world fucking apartment.  Fuck them.  Fuck all of them.  Fuck you.  I'd like you a big-ass you to fucking Xbox Live.  I work a 40-hour-a-week job.  I come home.  I try to fucking relax. 
[01:13:30]  And within five minutes,  I'm being called a faggot by every 12-year-old  on fucking Xbox Live.  And then I get mad.  And then I try and fucking explain.  And I have a 40-hour-a-week job.  And then you're called a faggot again.  Fuck you, Xbox Live.  Fuck you.  Call the Opie and Anthony SU line.  866-SU-LINE-1.  That's 866-SU-LINE-1.  Sirius XM.  XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:14:00]  Just like Muhammad Ali,  they called him Cassius.  Watch me bash this beat like a scum  that you knew I had beef with.  Why do you riff with me?  The maniac cycle.  And when I pull out my jam and get ready,  cause it might go loud.  How you like me now?  The ripper will not allow.  You two get riffed.  Mr. Smith, don't riff.  Listen to my gear shift.  I'm blasting.  I'm blasting.  Kind of like shaft.  So you can say I'm shafted. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, English filled my mind.  And I came up with a funky rhyme.  I'm gonna knock you out.  Why this today, E-Rock?  Muhammad Ali became world champ 49 years ago.  Oh, fuck.  Clever E-Rock.  Wow.  And I saw that.  I didn't put the two together.  That is clever.  Yeah, Ali became champion 49 years ago.  Sonny Liston.  Right.  All right.  I like that one.  Muhammad Ali become champion.  Look, I know we got fans of this person in studio, 
[01:15:00]  but is Chelsea Handler really only 38 years old?  Someone has to say this.  I'll be the one.  Is this a typo?  I would swear she's 48.  Really?  There's no way Chelsea Handler is only 38 years old.  You don't think?  No.  Can we look it up real fast?  Anyone?  What, you guys scared of Chelsea Handler?  No, my friend.  No.  People are saying she's shaving some years.  I don't know. 
[01:15:30]  She's got to be shaving some years.  There's no way she's 38 years old.  Or, oh, you think?  It's her birthday today.  It's her birthday?  It's her birthday, yes.  It's my birthday.  Carrot Top, 46 today.  Carrot Top.  Yeah.  Nice.  What do you got on the Wikipedia for Chelsea Handler?  Chelsea.  Everything online is saying 1975.  There's no way. 
[01:16:00]  Wow.  All right.  75.  Fair enough.  What else is going on today?  Go for her.  You guys watched the Daytona 500?  I didn't watch, but I heard Jimmy Johnson won.  Yes.  First time in a while, right?  Yeah.  Six years, something like that.  Six years?  Well, we remember when he won, like last time, right?  I think he, didn't we do an interview with him?  Yeah.  He was our go-to driver.  He certainly was.  He used to do our show.  He liked our show. 
[01:16:30]  What happened?  I don't know.  What happened with that one?  Mom!  He'd probably still do it if he was in town.  Maybe.  Well, he won.  Let's get him on the phone.  They had that big accident, though, the day before.  What happened?  The nationwide race.  What happened, though?  Did a kid take a tire to the head?  I don't know.  There was a bunch of fucking...  I heard rumors that a tire fucking took somebody out.  Did anyone end up dying?  Debris.  No one dead, but some injuries.  Some good injuries.  They said some bathers were possibly injured. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  Speaking of which, did you like the Jaws music to get those fuckers off the stage?  Yeah, that was pretty good.  They had a good bit, but then they don't use it.  I know.  Fuck.  But the one guy, they shut up.  They shut him down with the Jaws music.  Yeah.  That was pretty good.  And then everyone feels sorry for the guy, but they're all told, look, this is what's going to happen.  Yeah.  You go more than, I think it's a minute.  We're starting the music, and we're going to shut you down.  Didn't the guy come out and get one of them, though?  Was there a black dude that came out and escorted someone off, or were they together on the stage? 
[01:17:30]  I could be wrong.  I was robbing them.  I don't know.  Did Richard Dreyfuss go, what's this music?  Did he know what it was?  30 seconds was perfect.  Yeah.  Those beaches will be open.  It's the 4th of July.  The dumb anchor suit.  It really was a terrible suit for the mayor of a beach with sharks eating people to be wearing anchors on it. 
[01:18:00]  His anchor suit.  Where's our NASCAR people?  NASCAR, yeah.  Where's our NASCAR people?  The fucking car went into, pieces of the car went into the stands.  It's amazing that they survive most of those crashes.  Did you see the one car?  There was nothing left of it.  Yeah.  They didn't even know how to tow it off the track because there was nothing.  Yeah, there was no front left.  There was nothing to hook it onto.  Yeah.  And the guy just kind of, you know, just kind of like took his time getting out.  They saunter out of it.  They do, right? 
[01:18:30]  Those cars now, yeah.  You know they're panicking inside because in the end you're a human being, but they know in front of their other NASCAR drivers, they got to be cool and collective.  Look at that shit, man.  Yeah, that was pretty fucking brutal in the stands.  That shit.  Oh, yeah, there it is.  A little spin.  The car hits the wall, goes up, be forced into that safety fencing, and pieces of that car wind up on the grandstand side of the racetrack. 
[01:19:00]  Larson was...  Wow.  That happened to me one time when I was driving.  Never did.  Yeah, it did.  Wheels came off.  I was like, fuck it.  I won anyway.  Never did.  Okay in the crash and flying from his car, but again, some 15 spectators were injured and transported to local hospitals.  Drivers all, including winner Tony Stewart, reacting with concern after the race.  Yeah, but the important things, what's going on on the front stretch right now, it's...  You know, we've all always known, and since racing was started, this is a dangerous sport, but it's... 
[01:19:30]  Really?  It's hard when you...  You know, we assume that risk, and it's hard when the fans get caught up in it, so...  They assume it too, shitheads.  As much as we want to celebrate right now, and as much as this is a big deal to us, and we're worried about the drivers and the fans that are in the stands right now.  Fire, concrete, but I mean, those safety fences with that curve, whatever, they take care of most of that shit nowadays.  The thing is, the wall is supposed to stop them, but when the way that crash happened, the car hit another car and launched up higher than the cement wall and hit the fucking fence. 
[01:20:00]  But the fence did a pretty good job of keeping the...  Most of the shit in.  Big, heavy, like, parts out of the stands, but, you know, a lot of shit gets through there like a cheese grater on the fence, and it kind of went through, yeah.  Hey, what's that?  You think you would suck to get hit in the head with a piston as you're sitting there?  Oh, my God.  At a NASCAR race.  Fucking, like, scalding, piping hot piston rod.  Like, what the fuck? 
[01:20:30]  Oh, man.  You're almost as bad as not getting hit one with watching the race.  All right, here we go.  Oh, this is the bit?  Yeah, this is, uh, Melissa McCarthy.  This get any bigger?  No?  And Paul Rudd.  This was a terrific bit last night at the Oscars.  An actor's voice.  An audible chameleon.  From that lone voice, a thousand characters can emerge.  Emerge!  For example...  I'm a robot named Ping. 
[01:21:00]  I just want to learn how to swim.  Wow.  Wow.  Thank you.  Where's Paul Rudd?  I don't know.  Oof.  Don't hurt me, Bear.  I'm just an inner-city mouse with a lisp. 
[01:21:30]  What the fuck is this?  Fucking hilarious.  Oh, Chippa likes it.  I don't know.  So you begin a lot of animation work?  Oh, no.  I'm actually not.  I changed my, an email.  So I'm figuring it's, you know, it's all going to come.  Yeah.  Piling in.  When they figure it out and stuff.  Yeah.  Whew. 
[01:22:00]  You probably are...  No, no, no.  How much longer?  Oh, this is only, like, the beginning.  No way.  Yeah.  Come on.  This is terrible.  Maybe it could be a tower change.  You never know.  I mean, with all this technology, the phones.  Here are the nominees for the best.  Was that good?  Wow.  I don't know what it was.  I don't understand it.  Yeah, yeah.  It was supposed to be, I guess, for an animation.  Animation's easy money in Hollywood, so they were using their time on the stage to audition,  maybe, for some animation projects.  I think that's what they were doing, but I'm not really sure. 
[01:22:30]  Narable.  You got me by the short and curlies.  I tell you, it's all great to me.  I turn it off.  I turn it right off.  Yeah.  I say, where's the ball game?  What the hell do I know?  Ah, you and your fancy dresses.  Regular Joe.  Give me a Carhartt jacket.  That keeps you warm on the job site.  You dress all fancy.  What the hell do I know over here?  You don't like Regular Joe?  No.  I've worked with Regular Joe too many times.  Regular Joes are idiots. 
[01:23:00]  Think he's an ass?  Yes.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Halleberry.  Yeah.  What do you think?  No.  Sorry.  It doesn't do anything for me.  Another boy haircut too.  I know.  Boy haircuts are in in Hollywood.  No to Halleberry.  I love doing that.  How about this one?  Helen Hunt.  Helen Hunt?  Yuck.  Yeah.  I wish her first name was Kellen.  Kellen Hunt? 
[01:23:30]  I know what you mean.  Kellen Hunt.  How about Nicole Kidman?  I like part of her name.  No.  There was something else with the Daytona 500.  What happened with our new pal 50 Cent?  Oh yeah.  He tried to kiss.  What's wrong with Aaron Andrews?  He tried kissing a white woman.  Why wouldn't she have it? 
[01:24:00]  Because she's not into fucking having 50 Cent kiss her.  What happened though?  What was the big deal?  Well he went in for the kiss on the cheek and then she moved and then she moved her head  and then he went in for like a kiss on the lip.  She moved again and then he kind of wrapped his head around for the other cheek.  But you've never seen somebody avoid a kiss.  It was literally just one of those awkward moments.  But who the fuck is she?  Fuck that.  She don't want 50 Cent kissing her.  Plus she didn't even want to talk to him.  She was trying to find Danica Patrick or some chick.  Yeah. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah but it's 50 Cent.  She probably doesn't even know who it is.  Just some black guy trying to fucking sexually assault her.  He loves blondes.  50 Cent.  He was with Chelsea Handler.  And he was trying to mack on Aaron Andrews.  Trying to mack?  Let's see this.  A little m'dickin'.  Just trying to get some m'dickin'.  Let's see if we can talk to her.  Of course 50 Cent here.  Well hold up.  Pause.  Pause.  Pause.  Good to see you.  What are you talking about?  She didn't want to talk to him.  She grabbed him over.  No.  Keep watching.  But she grabbed him over and said in here we got 50 Cent.  Yeah.  Talking to him doesn't mean fucking tongue kissing. 
[01:25:00]  Give up the push for 50.  There you go Jimmy.  You tell him.  Let him jerk off looking at you through a keyhole.  I didn't forget that story.  She's looking for somebody and then 50 just walks over to her.  So her producer was obviously, hey 50 Cent's there.  All right.  So talk to 50 Cent for a minute.  Well he makes it difficult because he rapes her cheek.  Who's more popular, fucking him or her?  I rest my case.  Bit over.  She's only famous because someone was peeping her nude body.  Yeah.  But no one wants to talk about that.  That's why she got all those big time gigs. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  Sam.  Sam.  What the fuck?  What the fuck's wrong with you?  I'm not, I'm obviously a 50 Cent fan.  I think I've made that clear.  But who is she?  If she wasn't peeped, she would not be at Daytona 500.  She wouldn't have been on that Dance with the Stars I think she did, right?  Yeah.  That was all because someone looked at her nude body and she was upset by it.  That's right.  The only reason she got the big gigs.  She is done being objectified.  Ah.  So you take a fucking kiss on the cheek for 50 Cent. 
[01:26:00]  No.  At this point, you don't have to.  A kiss on the cheek is just polite.  Yeah.  She was forced into it.  Exactly.  Of course, 50 Cent here.  I'm going to go talk to Danica Patrick.  Good to see you.  What are you doing here?  I'm enjoying myself.  I'm enjoying all the festivities while we roll.  We're going to go see.  Ah.  It's a slow-mo.  They're doing a slow-mo.  Oh, no.  She's like, whoa, no, no.  Oh, look at that.  Pull her head back.  No.  Oh, God. 
[01:26:30]  That's a good slow-mo, though.  That's funny.  Who has it?  Deadspin?  Deadspin.  Deadspin has it.  We'll put it on our Facebook page, E-Rock.  She's racist.  All right.  It's going up on our Facebook page as well, Opie and Anthony.  He was going for her cheek, and then she happened to turn into his face.  Yeah.  He wasn't going for the lips.  He was just going for her cheek like, hello.  Yeah.  It was one of those, you're walking down the hallway, and you don't know which way to move.  And the other guy doesn't know which way to move, and it's all awkward for a couple seconds.  That's what happened there.  You should have shot her.  That's all it was. 
[01:27:00]  And she wasn't blown off 50 cents.  She was looking for Danica Patrick.  Then went, oh, we got 50 cents, thinking she had time to do something with 50 cents.  But then someone obviously said, wait, we got her.  You got to go now.  So she's like, goodbye, 50.  That's what this is about, obviously.  I think she was using Danica as an excuse to get away from Fiddy after that awkward almost kiss.  It's our pal, 50, man.  He was in here.  He likes us.  He did our fucking theme song that we planned Fridays, by the way.  I'm team 50 in this one.  I'm not dissing her or him. 
[01:27:30]  I'm just saying that she did not want him kissing her.  Yeah, I like that.  She's a racist.  She's a racist.  Yeah.  She should be charged with racism.  Oh, man.  But a kiss on the cheek?  Did you see the Virgil update over the weekend?  I sure did.  Is that real?  Yeah, dude.  It is absolutely real.  What happened with Virgil?  Wait, hold on.  Pause before everyone sees what you're about to post here.  This isn't someone just fucking with him?  Absolutely not.  He was actually doing this?  Yes. 
[01:28:00]  All right.  Wait, I know what I was going to say.  Don't look.  Don't look.  Don't look.  Don't look.  I'll minimize it.  I knew there was a real reason why I paused.  Okay.  The people out there need the setup, because not everyone's in on the Virgil thing.  Well, it's come to our attention for a while now, and even Sam made a, was it a Tumblr  page?  Well, it's moved on.  It's LonelyVirgil.net now.  LonelyVirgil.net, and basically, he goes to all these signings uninvited with his own  card table and sets up shop, and he charges for his autograph. 
[01:28:30]  He's the guy who used to come out with Million Dollar Man, and he hustles so bad.  But everybody's got a story of him.  He's just like the people in Times Square that ask if you want a free CD, and then they sign  it, and then they bully you into $10.  Right.  He goes up to people.  Yeah, because they go, look, I can't fucking sell this now.  It has your name on it.  Exactly.  Right.  If you show any interest in him at one of these signings, he'll say, come here, come  here.  Then he'll say, why don't you take a picture?  Well, let's take a picture together.  Yeah.  And then he says, give me my money. 
[01:29:00]  And he goes, what's your name?  And you go, oh, I'm Sam.  And he goes, all right, would you like this picture?  You're like, yeah, it's a nice picture, and he signs it, and then he goes, $50.  $50.  He's a con man.  What?  Did you pay him?  I gave him $40 once.  You got bamboozled?  But then I created a whole thing based on that.  Well, true.  And then I followed him from convention to convention, humiliating him after that.  Who is equity in that?  Can we see your website before we go on with the update?  Well, yeah, but you have to shut your eyes for a second because the top photo is the update.  Oh, you put it up there ready.  Oh, of course.  I mean.  All right.  I won't look. 
[01:29:30]  You don't know what this is about yet, Ed?  No.  Oh, my God.  Not at all.  And Deadspin has been covering this.  Right.  But they got their whole Virgil thing from me.  You think?  I know.  They saw my blog.  They saw Lonely Virgil, and then they started doing it.  Yeah, and people have been sending you Lonely Virgil pictures from all over the place.  You got a picture of him here sleeping.  Let's go through the pictures real fast.  So this is in Chicago.  Yes.  Where he's just at a convention.  He's asleep because nobody's come over to him.  And in the background, you can tell it's a very busy convention, but not so much in front  of his table.  Not for Virgil.  And there's, I guess, the million-dollar belt. 
[01:30:00]  Right.  Is that the actual million-dollar belt, or did he have one made?  It's a replica.  Oh, a replica.  If you remember the best million-dollar belt story.  Oh, of course.  I know exactly which one you're going to tell.  Wait, let him tell it himself.  Well, Iroch actually got lucky.  Iroch?  Iroch, I will do your part.  Yes, we've done this bit before, but I need to hear it again.  I love it.  Go ahead, Iroch.  I was at one of those things here in New York where Ted DiBiase was actually appearing.  Million-dollar man, of course.  Because Virgil, just a little, Virgil always walks around with a sign that says, million-dollar 
[01:30:30]  man, Ted DiBiase, and Virgil.  And Virgil.  But Ted DiBiase is rarely there with him.  Right.  This one that Eric went to, he happened.  This was something that was billed as Ted DiBiase, no mention of Virgil.  He just showed up.  You think Ted DiBiase's had enough of Virgil's fucking...  Man.  Virgil just shows up.  I know promoters.  He shows up.  Pilot fish.  He's not invited.  Rumble.  Too funny.  So I was all excited.  I never met the gentleman.  I wanted to get my belt signed by the million-dollar man. 
[01:31:00]  And I got to meet him.  He signed it.  It was great.  And as I'm getting ready to take a photo with him, Virgil goes, oh, let me sign it, too,  since I wore it, took the belt, and signed the belt while I was taking my photo.  You didn't want him to sign it.  I did not want him to sign it.  Of course not.  Oh, God.  It's forever ruined.  And then, let me see.  Well, is it really ruined, though?  Yes.  Okay, good.  And then...  Mark that.  Eric forever wanted a picture of him in Million Dollar Man Ted DiBiase. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  You want to see Eric's picture with Ted DiBiase?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got this off Lonely Virgil on Twitter.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Why is he there?  And you can see how pissed off Eric is.  And you can't...  And you're leaning toward Ted DiBiase.  Toward Ted.  Yeah.  Because Eric's...  Because I know what you're thinking here.  You know, if I lean a little to the right, I think I can photoshop Virgil out of this.  Yeah, you're definitely leaning.  But if you look at it, you can't crop Virgil out properly.  Because there's a big black hand on the Million Dollar Tidal Belt, and it's Virgil's. 
[01:32:00]  He's holding the belt that E-Rock's holding.  He's holding it tight, too, and Eric's trying to pull it away from him.  So Virgil insists on signing the belt.  He jumps into this photo.  Did he charge you?  He tried to.  And I said, I didn't ask for a photo with you.  Oh.  Why wouldn't you just give him some cash?  Give him some cash.  Well, I already paid in advance for Ted's photo and signature package.  So I paid for it already.  Signature package?  Well, you pay for it and then they do anything you want. 
[01:32:30]  I just don't know this world.  Do you want a picture with Ted alone?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I paid for the photo and something signed by Ted DiBiase.  Could you get another belt like that?  I could.  They're expensive.  It costs like $500.  Oh, my God.  He ruined a $500 fucking item?  Yeah.  That he did.  And he signed.  That's great.  The belt is like a fake gold.  So you could think maybe you could buff it out or shine.  On the back, it's felt. 
[01:33:00]  And that's what he signed.  Jesus.  What a fucking.  But he was part of the whole thing.  Intrusive asshole.  Nobody wants that.  He wasn't part.  I mean, it was a gimmick that didn't work.  He wasn't part of anything.  Yeah, because as soon as he was away from Ted and they gave him the belt, they fired him  because nobody gave a shit.  Superstar Virgil.  They never made him into something else, Virgil?  No.  He was your favorite thing, Opie.  What?  He was a jobber.  Jobber.  Officially, he was a jobber.  He was absolutely a jobber.  Like the Brooklyn Brawler?  Exactly like the Brooklyn Brawler.  Wow. 
[01:33:30]  I always thought Virgil was bigger than that.  No.  He's trying.  How come Ted doesn't show up to these things?  Because he's got to get paid to show up to these things.  Is he popular?  Yeah, he's like a Hall of Fame legend, you know?  He's very popular when he shows up.  You pay for his travel and lodging and stuff.  But people want, if Ted DiBiase shows up, there's a line for him?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  But what about Virgil?  Do you have to pay for his lodging and his travel?  He's not even invited.  He just sets up camp?  Dude, I know.  He really is not invited.  I've literally spoke to multiple promoters who explain that Virgil hears about a show or a signing. 
[01:34:00]  Holy shit.  There's a photo of him.  Rob Van Damme's doing a signing, right?  Yeah.  And there's a line out the door because that's a rare thing.  He's a very popular guy.  Who is he?  He's just a wrestler.  He wrestled for all the companies, though.  So, Virgil sets up a table outside the sports memorabilia store that Rob Van Damme is inside.  And he tries to hustle people that are online waiting for Rob Van Damme.  What a trick.  Oh, my God.  That's embarrassing. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  All right.  So, here's him in Chicago.  Yep.  Scroll up.  This was my original photo.  It was at a Sinamania wrestling show.  How come there's no one there to meet him?  Nobody wanted to.  It was a wrestling show.  There were only wrestling fans there.  And they still didn't go to the...  Just to kill time and go in front of him for a little bit?  There's not even any muddy footprints near him.  There is nobody.  That floor is clean.  That's a white floor.  It's pristine.  All right.  So, we scroll up a little.  This is in Orlando.  Virgil, wrestling superstar. 
[01:35:00]  He's got a big title.  No one's there.  He sets up the big banner?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  This was the Motor City Comic Con in Detroit.  Again.  No one there.  Look how shiny the floor is.  So shiny.  Not a scuff mark to be had between...  Lonely Virgil.  The camera and Virgil.  Lonely Virgil.  Do you think he knows about this site?  I don't know.  It's been weird.  Weird people have picked up.  You know Mark Lamont Hill, that Fox News commentator, the black guy who's always on? 
[01:35:30]  Yes.  He randomly tweeted that he saw the blog one day.  I don't know.  Weird people have been seeing the blog.  Oh, he used to be on Red Eye a lot, right?  Yeah.  He works at Columbia or something?  That's a good concept, man.  This is Calgary.  Alberta, Canada.  All right.  He's got to have people in front of him.  Yeah.  Look how long the fucking walkway is to his lonely table.  And there's no one.  No one.  But maybe he gets there really early.  No.  Maybe you're bamboozling everybody.  I can't tell you how many Virgil sightings I've seen myself.  All right.  Keep going. 
[01:36:00]  This is not a bluff.  Okay.  This is Detroit.  There's a line, but that's for the table next to him.  Oh, no.  The table next to him.  Really?  How embarrassing is that when there's a line for the table next to you?  And nobody for you.  And as you can see here in this photo, Virgil's enjoying some popcorn.  All right.  Is there a line when Snooker shows up?  Yes.  Okay, brother.  Yeah, there's a line when Snooker shows up.  He gets a line.  Yeah.  Who has the longest line?  Like Bob Backlund, of course, probably has the longest.  No, Bob Backlund doesn't have the longest line.  Who has a really long line? 
[01:36:30]  The warrior.  Ultimate warrior.  Hulk Hogan.  Warrior.  Warrior.  And those guys charge $100, $150 for a fee.  Oh, yeah.  I want an autograph.  Really?  Yeah.  Crazy.  Here's New York City Comic Con.  Okay.  There's a lot of hustle and bustle.  Right.  But they've cleared away for Virgil.  They're just walking back and forth in front of him.  Oh, God.  This poor guy.  Fuck him.  Really?  Ruined fucking Iraq's belt.  I'm so happy he ruined his belt.  Yes.  This is WonderCon in Anaheim.  Much to what Iraq's gut is done.  I didn't mean that. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, wow.  I'm sorry, Eric.  WonderCon in Anaheim.  Oh, my God.  There's no one near him.  I took that photo.  That was not a bluff.  Okay.  Wow.  And then, oh, this is Niagara Falls.  I thought this would be the new one.  All right.  That should be good.  Niagara Falls.  Not much going up on in Niagara Falls.  I can.  Oh, Jesus.  It's all just Virgil in different shirts.  Hoping.  With pristine floors in front of him.  No one.  And we got a Virgil story on the line, by the way.  Okay.  Here is the update. 
[01:37:30]  All right.  Wait.  All right.  Let's go to the Virgil story first.  Oh, God damn it.  Because we got to end with Sam's update.  Let's say hi to Nick in Boston.  Nick?  Oh, what's going on?  Welcome aboard.  What's up, buddy?  So, I went to World of Wheels back in 08.  Virgil's standing there in the middle of the Coliseum going around.  Me and my girl walk by.  He goes, yo, honey, you want a picture with a superstar?  He grabs her tit and ruins a picture.  Grabs her tit?  Oh, yeah.  It's in the picture. 
[01:38:00]  Send the picture to me.  Yeah.  On Twitter.  Not Sam.  Yeah, Sam can put it on his blog.  I need that.  Yeah, dude.  I'll find it.  I'll send it.  I've told this story before, but at the Anaheim thing in WonderCon, I watched him humiliate  a guy in front of his girlfriend and get $80 out of him because he's doing his whole hustle  and they're in front of his table and he's just an old wrestling fan.  So, he goes, oh, these are cool pictures because Virgil sells pictures of him with  other wrestlers in it.  So, people want to look at the photos and once you're looking at them, you're finished. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, no.  So, he starts looking at the photos and he goes, what's your name?  You like this one?  And the guy goes, yeah, I'm Mike.  And he signs the photo.  He does his deal.  Oh, man.  Then he asks his girlfriend, what about you, honey?  What's your name?  And she signs one for the girlfriend.  He goes, honey.  He goes, how about I get a picture with your girlfriend here?  Why don't you take a picture with me and your girlfriend?  Oh, my God.  He goes, okay.  He takes a photo.  Virgil goes, you too, buddy.  You get in here too.  He goes, oh, what a cock.  Okay.  And then he goes, all right.  So, and then as the guy is standing next to him, posing for the picture, his girlfriend's 
[01:39:00]  right there, Virgil just whispers to him, all right, so since you both did it, I'll cut  you a deal.  It's $80.  And $80, but the guy has to give it to him because his girlfriend's right there and  he doesn't want to look like a schmuck.  Look like a schmuck, you'll walk away.  You look like a schmuck giving the $80.  But he was nervous.  Yeah.  I understand that.  So he didn't want to try to haggle him and his girlfriend be like, no haggle, just going,  fuck you.  Yeah, that's where you don't look like an asshole. 
[01:39:30]  The fact that he got his girlfriend to go to this thing was a victory for this guy.  She's probably like, all right, I'll go.  I stood there the whole time watching this go down.  He handed Virgil $80 in cash.  You need videos on this blog.  The possibilities are limitless.  All right.  Yes.  So here's your update.  All right.  I apologize.  We haven't talked about Virgil in a while.  He was in town this weekend signing.  Uh-huh.  Whoa.  In town.  I unfortunately did not get to see him.  I did look.  I promise you.  I did not get to see him.  But somebody else did.  Uh-huh.  And they snapped this photo of Virgil. 
[01:40:00]  What?  At the Grand Central Station subway.  Yeah.  He's not in signings anymore.  Virgil is in a subway station.  Oh, my God.  With a sign that says Virgil WWE Superstar and a bag of glossy 8x10s.  Oh, my God.  Is this his bit?  Maybe he knows that the internet's going to talk about this.  Right.  But either way, if this is his bit, so be it.  But he's in the subway. 
[01:40:30]  Dude.  Selling photos in the subway.  How many people would do you even?  The Grand Central Station subway.  Next to the guy who drums with no arms.  Right.  Yeah.  And the guy who sells deodorant and says it's for homeless people.  It's Virgil selling 8x10s.  Look at the little sign that says Virgil WWE Superstar.  And what's there?  He's got, those are his 8x10s that he sells.  One has him with Andre and Ted DiBiase, and the other one has another bunch of guys.  Oh, my God. 
[01:41:00]  He's just in the subway like any panhandler.  That's all it is.  Holy shit.  Maybe he's smart, though.  Maybe he knows this will go viral.  No.  He's got a problem.  This is sort of going viral.  Should I hate him?  I find myself hating him, and I don't want to.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He does.  I mean, he absolutely is heartless when he hustles.  He's just trying to.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's trying to hustle people out of money.  But life's gotten that bad for him?  He's been doing this for years and years and years.  How is he when you interview him?  He won't do interviews.  He charges. 
[01:41:30]  I've got up to him at so many conventions saying, whatever, whenever you want, because  I badly want to talk to him at a convention.  Sure.  And whenever you want, I go to his table multiple times.  It's like, and he comes up with these numbers.  $50, $100, whatever it is.  And he goes, can't do it right now.  I'm making money.  He said that to me once.  Making money.  You say, where?  Where are the people?  That's why I stood there and watched him and clicked taking another picture.  LonelyVirgil.net, son.  Oh, man.  Making money right now. 
[01:42:00]  What if you walk up to the table and go, can I take a picture of you?  He'll charge you.  Would he get mad?  Yes.  What if you just take it with your camera and walk away?  You've got to be stealth.  Because you also need as much floor as you can.  That's true.  You've got to really.  You've got to really.  You've got to really.  You've got to really.  You've got a floor in there.  Iraq comment.  I got to see him at New York Comic Con.  Right.  And there was nobody around him for a while.  I was sending Sam photos of this.  Right.  And then I started texting Sam about what he started to do.  When like adults were at other tables and their kids would wander like to the next table  or two tables over where Virgil was.  He'd sneak him behind the curtain and put his fingers in that high knee. 
[01:42:30]  No, Uncle Paul.  I thought this was a good story.  They'd look at the belt and the photos that he had out there.  He'd start asking, you know, talking to the kids and ask them what their names are.  Start signing stuff already.  Oh my God.  And then tell the parents.  So when the parent realizes the kid's over there and they would come over, he said, well  that's going to.  They came over and you've got to pay me now because I signed the thing to your kid.  I laugh at him.  This is a picture of him in the yellow sweatsuit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's outside somebody else's signing. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  Oh my God.  And he just shows up in his yellow sweatsuit and yells at the people waiting in the line  for somebody else.  It's like a hyena.  And tries to get them to buy stuff from him.  Yeah.  It's a vulture.  See why he's lonely Virgil.  Lonely Virgil.  That net.  Ted DiBiase must just be like, oh my God.  Give me the fuck away from this guy.  I'm fucking embarrassed that I'm even attached to this guy.  You think Ted's got to be polite when Virgil shows up?  Hey, are we doing a signing today?  He's like, I'm right.  Now I completely believe that picture. 
[01:43:30]  That one where he's just on a road.  That's not photoshopped.  In a parking lot.  That's really a real, why isn't that on your blog?  It is.  Look at the tag on it.  Oh, it is.  Okay.  Yeah.  At first, when I first saw that picture, I was like, because he's in the middle of a  road in a parking lot.  And it says Ted DiBiase and Virgil, WWE superstar.  It's spelled Ted D-Basey.  It's spelled wrong.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's spelled wrong.  Is that really spelled wrong?  No.  Yeah.  It's D-B-I before A.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God. 
[01:44:00]  And after seeing him in the subway now, I totally believe he would do that.  Yeah.  But he won't do interviews.  What a dumb motherfucker to not do interviews.  An idiot.  Charges.  No one's going to pay to talk to you.  No.  He's about an idiot.  He has no business sense.  We shot, like, a goofy video of Chip at Comic-Con sitting at one of the tables before people  arrived.  Uh-huh.  It looked exactly like this photo of Virgil at Comic-Con while people are there. 
[01:44:30]  That was Photoshop, though.  I had fucking people.  It was a video.  Is that it?  Photoshop.  You can't Photoshop a video.  Well.  All right.  There you go.  There's your update, though.  I love it.  It was in the subway.  Good for him.  Setting up a signing.  Good for him.  Yeah, there's a photo online of somebody.  Somebody actually took a photo with him in the subway station.  But that doesn't belong on Lonely Virgil because he's with somebody.  I like that from the back.  Stealth.  Boom.  You took that actual picture?  No. 
[01:45:00]  Somebody named Stadium Insider on Twitter took it.  Nice.  Good for him.  Is Virgil on Twitter?  There is a Twitter account that says official Virgil, but I can't.  I mean, me being the Virgil expert.  Well, of course.  I can't guarantee its authenticity.  Can't confirm nor deny.  He did post something on Friday, though, that said,  what's everybody doing for the weekend.  And then hours after that is when all of this stuff about him going into  Subway Station to chill his photos popped up.  All right.  Very good.  There's your Virgil update. 
[01:45:30]  We got something about Larry King after the break, huh?  Oh, my.  You got to hear this question.  Oh, that's a great tease right there.  If you want, I have Chris Jericho talking about Virgil if you want to play  that going to break.  Really?  You had it.  Yeah.  Well, I'm not mad.  Oh, you're making a face like, you ruined my tease.  No, I guess what I would say is why wouldn't we play it during the whole  Virgil segment?  Yeah.  Because you just ended it and went right to the Larry King thing to end the  show.  I mean, to go to break.  Did Chris Jericho talk about Virgil on our show? 
[01:46:00]  Yes, we asked him.  All right.  I don't remember this.  Was it him or Edge?  No, it was Chris Jericho.  How long ago was this?  March of last year.  How long is the clip I meant?  110.  110.  All right.  Yeah, let's play it.  We might not go to break.  We might not have to comment about this right here.  Do you have any Virgil stories?  Oh, shit.  Virgil?  That's actually a good question.  Virgil will always, you can't see this at home, but he'll always hit you.  I'm like, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look.  I'm looking.  I'm looking.  Look, look, look, look.  I'll come in the ring.  Look, look.  I'll give you a big arm drag. 
[01:46:30]  Look, look, look, look.  Then I'll give you a big body slam.  Look, look.  And it's like, I'm looking at you, and there's no such thing as a big arm drag.  It's like the most basic of maneuvers.  But Virgil, honestly, what he does is if there's like autograph signing conventions.  Yeah, no, that's why we're asking.  We know.  We're all about it.  You get invited to do a convention.  You show up.  He just brings his own table, like a picnic table, sets it up in the corner, and just  starts signing autographs.  Yeah, yeah.  But the problem is he's not signing autographs because we got a whole montage of pictures  of him sitting by himself in front of him. 
[01:47:00]  And I laugh with DiBiase's son all the time.  He has this sign that says, The Million Dollar Man, Ted DiBiase, and Virgil.  Yeah.  But DiBiase's not there.  No.  I had no intention of being there.  We laugh at this constantly.  I like that one, sucks to be Virgil, right?  There's Virgil.  Look, look, look, look.  I'm sorry, August.  Look, look, look.  There's no one ever in front of him.  I'm fucking looking right at you.  Stop hitting me.  That is exactly how he talks.  Oh, God, what a piece of shit. 
[01:47:30]  He is.  He's about a piece of shit.  He's about a piece of shit.  So you're saying we got to hear this Larry King thing?  Yeah, the Larry King question.  I mean, it's Larry King Hall of Fame.  Is it Hall of Fame?  Like, in the same category as, like, what did you do with the groceries?  How important is the board?  How important is the board?  I put this on how important is the board level.  Wow.  That's me.  Wow.  And I've heard them all.  All right.  The OPDN 3 Channel.  Who taught you how to do this stuff?  You, all right?  I learned it by watching you. 
[01:48:00]  On Sirius XM.  Coming up this week on At The Movies with Norton and Voss,  the guys review the latest Liam Neeson thriller, Taken 2.  It was awful.  It was great.  It stunk.  It was fucking great.  How he just beat everybody up.  I loved it.  It was predictable garbage.  Don't fucking, don't be scared of him.  You loved it.  It was terrible.  It was a terrible movie.  I love Liam Neeson.  I think he's amazing.  Her big, dad, stepdad, have pony. 
[01:48:30]  And then at the end, he brings the fucking big singer.  I saved her life.  Oh, it was fucking horrendous.  It was good action, though.  I mean, it was good.  The action was good.  Yes.  But so what?  That's all coming up on the next At The Movies with Norton and Voss.  On the next American War Stories, Battleground, Iraq, Robert Kelly deploys and within an instant  realizes no man can prepare for war. 
[01:49:00]  We thought we were going to starve.  So we like brought like little like bars and stuff like, but there's going to be no food.  There was more.  I gained 30 pounds in Iraq.  There was you go to the buffet.  There's Chinese food, mac and cheese, barbecue, pizza, ice cream.  You can walk up to this ice cream and get as many ice cream bars and sunnies as you want.  But no matter how rich the rewards, every American soldier has to experience loss.  I was over there.  I had two milkshakes. 
[01:49:30]  One of the Marines goes, you're going to have both of those fatty?  So I gave him one and then my other one fell.  I had to go back and get two more.  So tune in as we chronicle the victories and the defeats for American hero, Bob Kelly.  I broke my knee, man.  On the next American War Stories.  I saw the Will Farrell look-alike guy yesterday 
[01:50:00]  at the Museum of Natural History in New York.  And I creeped him out by accident.  The Will Farrell look-alike guy is Chad Smith from Red Hot Chili Peppers. 
[01:50:30]  A great drummer.  And we've talked to him over the years here and there.  We get into this elevator just packed.  There had to be 20 people in there.  And I was like, he was facing the door and I was behind him.  I was maybe three feet away from him.  And I'm the only one that recognized that it's Chad from the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  Chad!  A lot of people think it's Will Farrell because they certainly look alike.  And my brother was face-to-face with him near the elevator door. 
[01:51:00]  So my brother was probably two feet in front of his face, staring right at him, but doesn't  know who he is.  So I decided to just, I couldn't help myself.  So, you know, the elevator's all quiet and I just go, big fan.  And then he thought my-  That's kind of creepy.  But what made it even creepier, he didn't know where it came from and thought my brother  who was right in front of him was saying it.  Yeah.  And just started staring at him awkwardly like, what the fuck?  And then he couldn't get out of the elevator quick enough. 
[01:51:30]  I was telling Ant during the break, though, I go to the museum a lot.  When you have people coming into New York, you got things to do.  It's in the area.  It's something to do.  I got the kids, you know.  Right.  Do they like it, the kids?  Oh, God.  I like it.  Yeah.  Pretty cool.  I see those dinosaurs every fucking time and it's awe-inspiring every time.  I'm never bored of it.  Yeah.  I still love that shit as a kid.  You should go.  I probably should. 
[01:52:00]  I would like that.  I think the last time I went was fucking like 10 years ago or something.  Yeah.  I reckon.  Those dinosaurs are a lot older now.  You're 60,582,010 today.  Happy birthday.  You can't wrap your head around it.  You're looking at stuff that's millions of years old.  Wasn't the Jurassic era alone?  How long did dinosaurs run around and fuck everything up for?  Over 2 million at this point?  Long.  2 million?  No.  For the T-Rexes and stuff, I think.  What was 60 million years? 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  They were like around for a long fucking time.  Wasn't it Jurassic era?  They had a good run.  But they started going away about 2 million years ago, right?  Am I wrong?  I don't know.  Longer.  Who knows their history?  I know.  I'm so embarrassed.  I think the dinosaurs started going away about 2 million years ago.  65 million years.  Was that how long the...  Was how long they were on Earth?  All dinosaurs or Jurassic?  That's a long fucking time.  I guess all dinosaurs?  So...  65.  Why didn't the environment change for that long? 
[01:53:00]  Meteor?  Meteorite?  That's what they say.  Asteroid?  Which one?  Which one is the one on the history of Earth?  Asteroid.  Asteroid, then it's a meteor, then it's a meteorite.  65 million?  I think dinosaurs were...  I think they died out a lot longer ago than 2 million years, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So what's the...  They died out about 66 million years ago.  Oh, okay.  Are you off by 64 million?  They might have been around for 200 million years?  Yeah, Jurassic...  The beginning of the Jurassic era was 201 million years ago. 
[01:53:30]  They were around for about 135 million years.  Not at least.  135 million years.  Not just the Jurassic era.  They first started appearing in the Triassic period.  Oh, yes.  Approximately 230 million years ago.  So...  Is this just off the top of your head, Sam?  Yeah, it's just...  I mean...  What's the difference between the Triassic and Jurassic?  Again, I know, but the audience doesn't.  Well, me too.  I'll explain.  The Jurassic era was when dinosaurs were the dominant creatures of the Earth. 
[01:54:00]  That was the 135 million year period.  So were cavemen around for the dinosaurs?  No.  No.  Common misconception because...  Common misconception.  No.  We missed them by fucking...  We missed them by 63 million years.  So why do they always put them together?  Because it's fun that way.  Yeah, you guys are cavemen riding a dinosaur.  Dinosaurs were fucking assholes.  I'll say this, though.  Oh, man.  You had 135 million years, and you did nothing more than eat lemons and berries. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, fuck yourself.  Not one.  They couldn't even build a hut.  That is odd.  There was no fucking, like...  Zero development.  Yeah, they didn't develop.  Do you think anything got better?  No.  In that hundred and...  No.  What is it?  35 million years?  You don't think anything got a little better?  Yeah, but...  Where they figured some shit out?  Zero.  It looks silly to have them, like, driving a car.  Why?  Dinosaur driving a car.  One thing that keeps the rain off you at 135 million years.  That is a long time for no fucking evolution whatsoever.  Like, any kind of... 
[01:55:00]  Doesn't that make you think a little bit?  Like, what the fuck?  Wow.  How is Earth able to have one thing like that for 135 million years, and then all of a sudden  it just...  It speeds up after that?  And we've only been around for, you know, a few fucking...  A few thousand.  A thousand years, really, in our form now.  A few hundred thousand, right?  Yeah.  By the way, I gotta talk to the other people out there.  Where dinosaurs died off, what, 2,000 years ago?  What is it?  Oh, right.  5,000 years ago.  5,000?  And...  Last dinosaur died off in 1931, I think. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  Was hit by a bus.  Right?  That's right.  Yeah.  Yeah, if you're, you know, a God-fearing person.  Yeah, sure.  Because the Bible just can't explain that type of timeline.  Right.  So they change it.  They go, no, no, Christ was there riding around.  He used to...  I used to raise him.  Pterodactyls.  Like the velociraptor.  Yeah.  And then someone's calling bullshit on the meteorite killing dinosaurs.  Well, what happened?  What changed that the dinosaurs went away?  They say the meteor.  Laugh. 
[01:56:00]  I can ask the right.  Who's calling bullshit?  Let's hear what they say.  Sure.  Let's go to James.  Mm-hmm.  I believe the meteor, by the way.  James in Tennessee.  Hi, James.  Hey.  I'm going to call bullshit on the meteorite killing dinosaurs because we just recently had a meteorite  here in Russia.  Didn't do shit.  Small one.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  Come on.  Are you serious?  Come on now.  Yeah.  You are really giving Tennessee a bad name.  It was a little tiny fucking thing that came through the atmosphere.  He watches the news reports on Russia and goes, well, that about proves it. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That showed it.  They're talking about the entire Gulf of Mexico was made from a meteor hitting.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Like, that whole thing is a crater.  All right.  Well, there are dinosaurs that populate the entire world.  Why was it that that affected the other side of the world?  It did affect the other side of the world.  Because it kicks up so much debris and dust that it blots out the sun and the temperature changes. 
[01:57:00]  And all the vegetation dies.  Yeah.  And these things.  The dinosaurs are cold blood anyway.  They don't need to.  But they do need to eat and they do need some sun.  And the temperature difference would get you.  It's like talking to a child.  Yeah.  All right.  Don't tell me.  Well.  All right.  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  Okay.  The great state of Tennessee made to look like a bunch of dolts from that one man. 
[01:57:30]  That's weird, though.  Yeah.  Someone just wrote on Twitter that they ruled for two.  Would we say 200 million?  Yeah.  They were around for 200 million.  They ruled for about 135 million.  I think they still fucking ruled.  I think they ruled for that other 65 million.  They had that, too?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They had a 65 million year transitional period.  Things might have got a little shady here and there.  But they still ruled, I do believe.  Is that the difference between them and us?  Like, they died 65 million years ago. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  So it took that long for the atmosphere to clear and for us to plop up out of the goop.  Something.  Out of basically Earthcum.  We stood up out of Earthcum and just shook it off.  No.  We were put here by aliens.  You think?  Yeah.  They seeded this fucking planet.  I find that easier to believe than the fact that there was a god who looked like me or  like fucking Edgar Winter last night winning his fucking sound award.  I find that much easier to believe.  Yeah.  I'm starting to feel we came here from somewhere else.  We seeded this planet for whatever reason. 
[01:58:30]  Well.  It just doesn't make sense, the whole thing.  If you think about cosmic goop, then yeah, we kind of did come from somewhere else.  Well, it's all cosmic goop, but the cosmic goop over here is a little more advanced, so  those people said, let's take our cosmic goop.  It's a little more advanced.  We don't want to wait how long it's going to take to fucking seed planet Earth, so we'll  take our goop and put it there.  Oh.  It's like Prometheus.  Yeah, man.  I like that shit.  Scary.  It's a giant terrarium. 
[01:59:00]  They're just fucking seeing what happens under different conditions.  Let's see what happens when we put life here.  And our time scale is much different than theirs, of course.  It's just weird.  So they're billions of years.  Something just went off kilter.  Just, it's so fucking strange.  I always go back to the point, like, we're not like anything else on this Earth.  The rest of the shit on this Earth kind of, kind of similar and work together.  And then we are ridiculously more advanced than anything.  And we always go back to what is the second most intelligent thing here. 
[01:59:30]  And you have to go with a dolphin or something who hasn't even figured out how to fucking...  I haven't figured out anything.  A cell phone or anything yet.  Yeah, how about making a boat your country?  Do something if you're the second most intelligent.  Well, how about a tuning net warning system for you and your fucking...  That's the thing that always says, creep me out.  Like, there's a ridiculous drop-off between us and the second most intelligent thing.  That's why it's embarrassing to get eaten by a lion.  So explain that.  Ah, fuck, man.  I'm so much smarter than this thing and it's ripping me to pieces. 
[02:00:00]  But it's disappointing.  But how do they explain that?  Through just guad?  I don't know.  Ah, guad.  The word guad.  I don't think it's as simple as that.  Something is fucked up out there.  Yeah, it is fucking weird.  I was thinking the other day how ridiculous it is that, like, if you go back just a couple  of hundred years, there's only drawings of things.  Yeah.  Like, there's no pictures or video if you go back a certain, you know, couple hundred  years, a few hundred years.  Right.  There's just fucking, like, if you wanted to see something, it had to be a drawing of it. 
[02:00:30]  And fast forward, like, I would say maybe two generations tops, those people will have  their entire lives recorded.  Yeah.  It'll be just, oh, this guy lived whatever years and here's his life, boom, if you want  to check it out.  You know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everything we're doing is going to, we will eventually have every moment of our lives.  Absolutely.  And we will all know everything that we do.  Future Jimmy?  Yes.  I told you, we're moving towards, Kaku talks about, like, this planetary force. 
[02:01:00]  With it, everyone is a sugar cookie.  We all run around like sugar cookie people.  Hey, is that Dr. Kahn?  Ah!  Ah!  Oh!  Don't!  Here's my money!  Ah!  Ah!  Who are you?  Here's my money.  I just wanted to introduce him to my family, was the last one.  He just couldn't get away from me faster.  Yeah.  Then awkwardly crosses the street.  I'm like, I'm not going to hurt you.  Space time bends when light travels. 
[02:01:30]  Here, and it's like if you had light and you bent it.  Dr. Kaku, hi.  Ah!  Oh, God, don't hurt me.  Here are my testicles.  Oh!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  I want to see it, to really appreciate it.  Next time I'm going to film it.  Hilarious.  I figure, look, if the guy's done our show as many times as he has, let's bring it to the  next level.  You think, right.  I want to introduce you to my family.  Yeah.  You live right next door to me, in the next building. 
[02:02:00]  Introduce him to yourself first.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Here's my family.  Right.  Oh, who are you?  Who are you?  Hi.  I've been behind him in line at the supermarket we go to, everything, and he just fucking,  like, like, he's got the memory of a mosquito or something.  Yeah.  For real life stuff, yes.  It's so weird.  This guy's saying everything we're saying is wrong.  We're wrong.  Okay.  Yes, we're wrong.  Dr. Steve?  Yeah.  Chris in New York?  Well, all right, but it's on New York. 
[02:02:30]  Hello?  Yes, Chris.  Hi.  Chris in New York?  Yes.  It's your time to make us feel bad about ourselves.  Go ahead.  The whole Gulf of Mexico being created by an asteroid, that's a misconception, too.  The asteroid hit in the Yucatan Peninsula.  Oh, right.  Okay.  I've been saying that for years.  No one believes me.  For years.  I am.  So where's the Yucatan Peninsula for these dummies?  It is in the Gulf of Mexico.  It's off the Gulf of Mexico.  Thank you.  Oh.  No.  Yeah, but it's not the size of the Gulf of Mexico. 
[02:03:00]  All right.  How big was the asteroid that hit that made the Yucatan Peninsula?  I don't know the exact miles.  But it is miles, right?  That was huge.  And the reason they know that is there is a certain element that was left behind by  the asteroid that pretty much is all over the Earth.  And that layer of time.  Right.  So where did it kick up?  I'm sorry, but the asteroid hit and then all that asteroid shit kicked up in the atmosphere 
[02:03:30]  and then fell back to the Earth eventually?  Yeah.  Pretty much what Anthony was saying in terms of nuclear winter.  But it's at its strongest levels at the Yucatan.  So they pretty much know that's where the asteroid hit.  How long do you think that shit was floating through the atmosphere?  I mean, that's got to be months.  It was years.  Had it for years.  How long?  How many years?  Don't know.  Does anybody know?  I'm curious.  Dr. Steve might know if he wasn't busy futzing around and meandering to work. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  A little floating.  It would sprinkle down like space dandruff.  But I'm curious as to how long that shit, I'm going to guess 50,000 years.  Oh, man.  Probably longer.  Probably, yeah.  Maybe longer.  Two million.  All right.  What the fuck do I know?  I'm just a queer.  Crazy.  Chris, thank you.  Didn't it rain for a million years or something?  What?  It can't rain for a million years?  No, it did.  That's how the water came.  I saw a special on the Earth.  I just got to laugh at that.  I'm sorry. 
[02:04:30]  I laughed at your knowledge.  It just sounds ridiculous that it rained for a million years.  What caused the rain?  That would be a pain.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Umbrella sails went through the roof, Craig.  Wear your rubbers.  It was raining.  That's how the ocean's got formed.  Would you like it if it rained for a million years?  Oh, it would feel like Seattle or something.  Take us out.  Oh, Jesus.  You know, after like, I don't know, after two weeks, you'd be really annoyed and you still  have pretty much still a million years.  A million years.  Yeah, a couple of weeks.  99,000.  Right.  A couple of weeks as far as a million years go. 
[02:05:00]  It's still pretty much half of a million and you're fed up.  Yeah.  Let's go to this Bible guy.  Yeah.  We got to get the Bible people involved here.  Josh in Queens.  Josh.  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Hi, Josh.  Hey, guys.  I'm not going to be one of those modern guys who says that it's got to be seven days with  the Bible, but for a dumb little Hebrew slave prince writing that book, Moses, he got the  order accurate, at least.  How's that?  That's something to say.  What do you mean?  All of a sudden, it's dark and now all of a sudden it's light. 
[02:05:30]  The earth shows up, then there's plants, then there's fish and birds, then there's animals,  beasts, and then man shows up.  Yeah, he kind of explained evolution.  Yeah.  Good for him.  Right.  For a guy who's living 10,000 years ago and has no clue, that's pretty accurate.  Pretty good.  I think most people could have figured that out.  Yeah.  I don't think they were that dumb.  Not people were stomping mud to turn into bricks.  That's pretty advanced.  Yeah, so he was...  Try to make bricks without straw. 
[02:06:00]  Pipe burst in your house and you have Jerry the plumber come over and he's going to explain  quantum physics and mechanics to you.  We also know how wide the asteroid was.  It was 6.7 inches wide.  That's pretty big.  Oh, see, that's not that wide.  Pretty big.  Anything else, Josh?  No, I had something about chocolate rain for 100 million years, but it's still time now.  Why?  That would have killed...  Yeah, I think it would have done...  I should have opened with that.  Dinosaur stuck in each other's wieners under a palm tree. 
[02:06:30]  All right.  All right.  Bye, sweeter.  Let's say hi to the one, the only, Dr. Steve.  Wow.  Hey, Dr. Steve, did you watch the Oscars?  It's all about Oscar talk today.  Oh, I watched The Walking Dead.  Oh.  And then watched the five-minute recap on the Today Show, and that seemed like plenty.  Yeah, you really don't need to see all the details.  Well, the Twitter haters went after me because I was watching the Oscars instead of the Islanders. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Who cares about the Islanders?  Who each is own?  That's what I always say.  Who cares about the Islanders at this point?  I'm trying to get into it a little bit, but it's a little tough.  You should abandon hockey because they were pricks.  Yeah, I'm not all in.  I'm not back in.  Yeah.  But then again, I have a shitty team.  If I had a good team, maybe I'd be back in.  Not that they're shitty.  They're doing it.  Oh, whatever.  Who gives a fuck?  They are under 500, though.  Again, Dr. Steve, what do you got on this whole dinosaur thing?  God, Gwad, and it's raining for a million years straight. 
[02:07:30]  If you're looking for the crater in the Yucatan Peninsula, just Google Chixxulub.  It's C-H-I-C-X-U-L-U-B.  Chixxulub?  What's that?  C-H-I-C-X-U-L-U-B, I think.  Hold on.  And that crater is felt to be the crater of the asteroid that hit the Earth and took out the dinosaurs.  He spelled it wrong, but I found it.  The element that that guy was talking about that was spread across the whole Earth is called iridium. 
[02:08:00]  And it...  And it sure did.  It got rid of them.  I like it.  If you go anywhere on Earth and go down to that level at 65 million years ago, you will find a layer of iridium there.  It completely blankets the Earth.  Now, let me ask you, how far down would you have to go, and how thick is the layer?  Well, it depends.  So, out in Arizona, the layer is up close because of erosion and stuff, you know, because there's dinosaur bones right at the top. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, true.  If you go to China or something where they haven't had as much, you know, you may have to go down lower.  But geologists are able to, you know, look at these layers and figure out which one in each part of the country represents that K layer.  Wow, it covers the entire Earth.  And what was that layer again?  It's iridium.  It's a metallic element.  How thick is that layer, do you think? 
[02:09:00]  I don't think it's very thick, you know, because you're talking about an event that in geologic time was very brief.  You know, it may have lasted, you know, 100 years, 200 years with the debris and the plodding out of the sun and all that stuff.  But that's nothing in geologic time.  Wait, is that all?  Do you think it lasted?  Just that short period?  Well, here's the thing.  I think what happened, and I'm not an expert on this, but just from the reading I've done, 
[02:09:30]  is that the first thing that happened was the plankton in the ocean died.  And that's huge because, you know, it's producing oxygen, and so oxygen levels change.  The marine life, that's the bottom of the food chain, so the marine life starts to die.  You start having a cascading effect on the food chain.  And then on top of that, you've got this nuclear winter where the climate is changing,  and it doesn't take that long for the dinosaurs to just starve out because they were so fucking huge, most of them. 
[02:10:00]  You rock.  That, you know, they had to just eat and eat and eat to keep these bodies going.  And they were eating a lot of the herbivores have to eat, you know, a certain percentage of their body weight just to stay alive  because plants don't have a lot of dense energy in them.  When the herbivores die, then the carnivores die because they don't have any other animals to eat.  And eventually, everything dies except for the fucking birds. 
[02:10:30]  Why don't we have giant things around anymore for the most part?  Well, you know.  There's a few, but.  Yeah, I'm holding one.  Why was there a time there were just giant things on Earth and now we don't have as many giant things?  Very few, matter of fact.  Huh?  Well, it wasn't very, I mean, it was successful for a long time, but it wasn't sustainable.  That was the problem.  You know, what you want is a lot of variety.  It was sustainable.  They were around for 200 million years, giant things. 
[02:11:00]  No, but their problem was one thing could take them out, and that's why, you know, it's, they're, it's not very adaptable.  I don't know.  I mean, we're in a world where we have a lot of variety of species, little tiny things.  Ugh, diversity.  Big things, and it seems to have been pretty successful in the 65 million years since the dinosaurs went away.  So, I don't know, man.  Steve, why do you think the little animals live there?  Dinosaurs.  Oh, God, the song. 
[02:11:30]  He rocks the dinosaur, Marge.  What do you think about?  Hold on, Steve.  He rocks the size of a dinosaur, Dinosaur.  I don't like this one.  God damn it.  Fucking E-Rox.  You stink.  You weren't listening again.  Your little T-Rox.  Fucking T-Rex arms.  I heard him say it.  No, we weren't.  He rocks the dinosaur, Marge. 
[02:12:00]  You herbivore.  You really weren't listening.  He rocks the dinosaur.  What do you think of dinosaurs?  I was humming this.  Oh, it's great.  I didn't see him yesterday.  Jesus, E-Rox.  This is the part where you guys call E-Rox stupid for playing the wrong E-Rox fat song.  Right.  But he did.  And it's accurate.  And he's trying to defend himself saying I was listening.  No.  You weren't listening.  Because we were doing the accent and everything.  Dinosaur.  Behind us all.  Yeah, you're futzing around.  Do you have the other one?  I'm looking for it.  That's not what I have here.  He was looking at his million dollar belt.  What were you doing in there? 
[02:12:30]  Bikini pics?  Virgil?  Comment?  No comment.  I was listening to you.  No comment.  All right.  Anyway, back to Dr. Steve.  Steve?  I kind of misspoke, too.  The largest animal that's ever lived on the earth is the blue whale.  And it's alive today.  So it's running our board.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  But was it around back then?  No, because they're blue whales are mammals. 
[02:13:00]  And so they move on.  You ever see a blue whale?  It needed the money.  You ever see the video of the blue whale?  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  I made one.  And they got one in the museum.  Replica.  Yeah.  To show you how fucking big these things are.  Ridiculous.  Hanging up on the ceiling.  A beached blue whale one time.  I just walked up and slapped it and said, who's Mr. Big Shot now, huh?  And I drank Evian in front of it.  That's so cruel, Jimmy.  So mean.  There's the blue whale in the museum right there. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  Look at how big that thing is.  Where's the song?  Holy fuck, man.  Installing it.  Yeah, I guess that.  What year did they install the blue whale in the museum?  That looks like 19...  The blue whale in the museum in actual history was 1958.  No.  No.  I'm not believing that at all.  That was the worst acting ever.  That was bad.  All right.  Well, look it up and you'll see I'm right.  And then we'll see who's acting.  Travis running down the hall.  Cool.  Hopefully it's because he has bad news medically.  What do you got, Travis?  What do you guys want?  Huh?  Oh, of course. 
[02:14:00]  Oh.  Nice.  Oh, he just showed you up, Iraq.  Thanks, Travis.  He just showed you up.  Nice.  I hear this.  Iraq is a dinosaur marching, marching.  Iraq is a dinosaur.  How did it get so fast?  Iraq is a dinosaur marching, marching.  Wake up, little piggy boy, and fucking take us out. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, that's the one, Iraq.  I know.  How did they get so fast?  Why does he talk like that?  I don't know.  Yeah.  That's my favorite, I think.  That is a good one.  When it was all said and done.  Dinazar.  Blue whale installed?  Yes.  1969.  No way.  1969.  That's it, huh?  It didn't look like 69.  1969.  Maybe that was when they started the process.  But 1969 is when it was installed.  Wow.  And it was based on a blue whale that was found beached in South America in 1925. 
[02:15:00]  Jimmy was fucking smacking.  That's right.  What year did we stop living in black and white?  That's a pretty fucking good question.  69, 70, right?  No.  We've only had color for what, since 1970?  No.  No, no.  Because there's moon landing footage in color.  We should have ours, I guess.  60...  Oh, God, yeah.  No, that was a fluke, though.  I'm telling you...  They just found it?  Yeah, it was like they were experimenting with shit. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  There was a fluke...  I would say the 60s.  No, but you're right.  The fucking...  Wait, the Wizard of Oz, was that colorized, or was that always color?  No, it was color.  No, yeah, it was always color.  But you'd think they were like, oh, how do we do this?  I don't remember how we did it.  I don't remember how we did it.  Well, if it was so terrific, why did they keep it to themselves?  Why weren't all the films made in color?  Gone with the wind.  Those fucks.  Fuck those people.  I remember having a color TV when I was five, so that would be around 1960, 61.  Rich kid.  Fucking A. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, you're a rich one.  Braggard.  Mm-hmm.  Color TV?  We didn't get a color TV until 1967.  You don't have a color neighbor?  It was stupid, because there was only one fucking show that was in color, and it was Disney,  as I recall.  Oh, the wonderful world of Disney.  As I recall.  What about Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom?  Black and white.  That might have been in color at some point.  Then they did the switchover.  The whole NBC Peacock just came out just to celebrate that they were broadcasting in color. 
[02:16:30]  The following broadcast is brought to you in living color on NBC.  Steve, you got anything else on the dinosaur thing?  Such a big fucking whale.  Hey, you know, they were maybe developing an intelligent dinosaur before they got killed,  though.  What?  And the paleontologists, it's just sort of a crackpot paleontology theory, but the velociraptors  were getting bigger brains before they got killed. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, we saw it.  And if they had been allowed to go on, maybe there would have been finally a hut-building  dinosaur.  We saw Jurassic Park.  All three of them.  I think we know that the velociraptor was very smart.  Who gives a turkey?  Spielberg got that from.  Oh, based in fact?  Yeah, I mean, well, based in relatively educated conjecture.  Well, that place would have been great if fucking stupid Newman hadn't screwed the whole  thing up.  And what?  Uh-uh-uh. 
[02:17:30]  Uh-uh-uh.  How annoying.  And what was the deal where they figured out that they actually walked on the two feet  instead of the four or the four feet instead of the two?  Didn't they have to adjust that recently?  Oh, the T-Rex, they had to, um, they had him standing up like Godzilla.  Right.  And then they had to make it where his tail balanced out the rest of his body and, you  know.  They made it a little adjustment, but that was only recently, right?  Within the last few years?  Yeah.  I think Jurassic Park actually pushed that through.  It was after Jurassic Park and people were like, why is it running like that? 
[02:18:00]  Like a big dog.  How did it become the bird?  I know skeletally the T-Rex is now a bird.  How did that happen?  That is, um, that is a, uh, theory.  There were feathered dinosaurs.  And the only real, if you've ever seen an ostrich.  I have.  I petted one for fuck's sake.  There's pictures.  Man, you don't listen to the show.  Jimmy told the story.  The only thing he doesn't have is teeth.  And that's the big difference between the dinosaurs and the birds is that the dinosaurs  had teeth. 
[02:18:30]  And they were a hundred feet tall and birds are shit.  You couldn't just step on a T-Rex.  They were ostrich-sized, uh, dinosaurs.  They were bird-sized dinosaurs, too.  You know, they, they ran the gamut from little.  Oh, really?  ...looking things to big giant monsters.  Was there anything that could step on the T-Rex?  I love Jimmy's glasses.  Well, the patasaurus, I guess, could have, but they were herbivores, so they, they were  more likely just to get in the water to get away from you.  And they were the ones with the teeny weeny heads, right? 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  On those giant bodies?  Giant body, giant weeny heads?  Teeny weeny, man.  They had teeny weeny heads?  Yes.  That's how the scientists, uh, explain it.  How big was that one compared to the Tyrannosaurus?  Well, it was bigger.  I, I don't, I don't know that.  Thanks.  You do realize we're counting on you to be an expert today.  Play the part.  Yeah.  Thanks, doctor.  How much bigger?  A lot.  A whole shitload.  Well, the Triceratops was used as a lawnmower, if you remember. 
[02:19:30]  I didn't like Ceratops.  He was, um, you know, and then he would eat the grass and look up and go, it's a living.  Flintstones.  Yeah.  He hated that show.  Yeah.  Triceratops.  Yes.  Oh.  That bombs terribly.  Yes.  He said, I didn't like it.  And he tried.  He got a zero.  Oof.  Try, try joke.  All right, Steve, we got to get to, like, Larry King.  So, are you good?  Thank you, sir.  Yeah, we're good.  We're good. 
[02:20:00]  All right, buddy.  I got to go get rounds.  I'll see you guys.  All right, buddy.  All right.  The Weird Medicine Podcast on Riotcast and heard on this channel as well.  Well, just snake a tube down our nose and I'll be there in an hour.  Exactly.  He's like, Steve's got to go to the fucking Kinko's and get toe tags printed.  Oh, God.  Jesus.  Run out of those yet?  Oh.  All right, Steve.  Saturdays at 9 p.m. when E-Rock doesn't run a replay inadvertently.  I heard.  Wait, what happened? 
[02:20:30]  Somebody called me on Sunday, Dr. Steve, and said that you had, again, had had the same  Dr. Steve show on the channel the last three weeks.  Is that true?  I think it was two weeks.  You'll have to ask Eric that.  Eric.  Jesus.  Dr. Steve obviously has an issue with you.  You want to address this?  Yeah, I already talked to him about this.  Well, talk to us.  Eric and I are good.  It was human error.  What happened?  I reloaded last week's show instead of this week's show.  Why?  Bush League?  It wasn't by choice.  But it's your job. 
[02:21:00]  It's to get it right.  I know.  It's an honest mistake for somebody the first week on the job.  Yeah, exactly.  What else were you doing?  Comment.  You're on.  What?  Loading the rest of the weekend.  Getting too busy to go home and eat meat steaks?  Getting loaded the weekend?  What?  I meant to say fucking meat cocktails.  Oh.  Meat.  But stuff like that happens around this joint.  Did you see the Jimmy Kimmel tweet?  No.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy Kimmel was talking about SiriusXM and basically said that he really enjoys the music  channels unless a song is skipping for an entire weekend and no one notices. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, wow.  Something like that.  Can you find the actual tweet?  It was brutal.  It's embarrassing.  He spanked SiriusXM.  Oh, you got it already?  I love SiriusXM radio except for every weekend.  Oh, every weekend.  When songs skip for hours and hours and no one there seems to notice.  So basically saying that it's sloppy programming.  I was listening this morning to the, when I was driving into the Hits1.  Why doesn't anyone notice? 
[02:22:00]  The Hits1 weekend countdown.  Yeah.  And they run this.  It's the same three-hour show the same way we do, but it's all weekend long.  And the thing I was listening to, Spider Harrison said something like, we'll have your next  big song coming up.  We'll have your next big song coming up.  And it was obvious that they had just left in both takes without.  Oh, wow.  I didn't play that way all weekend.  And no one noticed?  No.  See, when shit goes wrong with this channel, the listeners get involved, they start tweeting  all of us, and then we fucking all start panicking when our phone's texting people. 
[02:22:30]  We try to take care of the situation.  Yeah, Dr. Steve's show.  Unless it's Dr. Steve's show where they're just rerunning again.  He's only had one show on the channel ever.  E-Rock just plays the same one over and over and over and over again.  Oh, E-Rock.  That's not true at all.  Oh.  This problem has happened more than this time.  Oh, boy.  You calling out E-Rock today?  Well, not necessarily.  I think last time it was Sal's fault, but I always seem to hear that Dr. Steve's show  gets replayed constantly.  Yeah, and a lot of these idiots that listen to Dr. Steve's show don't realize when they're 
[02:23:00]  hearing a new show.  Because even Steve will say, no, this is a brand new show.  These idiots were right a few times, weren't they?  Well, and what's funny is that when this happened this weekend, everyone just blamed Sal  automatically.  You know, to Eric's credit, he offered to come in from Long Island and fix it, but the  show was half over, and I was like, you know, just let it go.  Eric lives on Long Island?  I'm going to build a company anyway, so. 
[02:23:30]  Oh.  All right.  You should.  I shouldn't have said that.  Good luck getting the money.  I probably shouldn't have said that, but anyway.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Yeah, I want to hear this Larry King thing.  Bye, Dr. Steve.  Thanks, Dr. Steve.  Thanks, Steve.  We're going to do that after the break, certainly.  Oh, man.  Yes, we are.  Nice.  Sometimes the road to a blissful relationship can be bumpy.  Uh, marriage is, is, is, I know.  Hey, Rich, no one's saying that you don't do a lot of stuff.  It's like, it's a business, it's a machine.  One person's doing the twittering, which is rich, and the other person is spelling all 
[02:24:00]  the words.  It's comedy's most dysfunctional married couple, Voss and Bonnie.  If passion is like a roaring fire, then Voss is peeing all over it.  Is he an affectionate guy?  He, no.  Is he bad with, like, casually loving, touching?  Well, because sometimes he touches you, but it's like a, a toddler or, or a monster that  doesn't, like, hasn't, hasn't figured out how to caress.  And why flatter the one you love and the mother of your children when you can shatter her fragile 
[02:24:30]  ego?  Right, Rich?  Sometimes he calls my ass Margaret Cho's face.  Wow, Rich!  So if you think your relationship is doomed, look at Voss and Bonnie.  And rest a little easier knowing it could be a lot worse.  I remember now what a dick he is.  One time I was blowing him quite well, by the way, and he farted.  And then he gets mad.  That's the best thing I've ever heard.  Not a whole thing. 
[02:25:00]  Sirius XM.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Woo-hoo!  Woo-hoo!  I think we could squeeze Larry King in before Kevin Smith calls.  Yeah, I want to hear that.  I think we could do that there, Sam.  Woo-hoo! 
[02:25:30]  And people are trying to figure out the best Larry King question ever, because we got another  terrific example of Larry King asking questions.  Yeah.  You got Matt the Aussie.  Aussie, excuse me.  He writes, best Larry King question ever?  Saying Roman Polanski murdered Sharon Tate to Sharon Tate's sister.  Right.  That was my favorite, for sure.  That was a good one.  You forgot about that one.  A man who so brutally murdered your sister.  Murdered your sister.  How could you? 
[02:26:00]  She goes, no.  No.  That's not.  My favorite still is the board.  I put this.  How important is the board to a skateboarder?  I like the groceries.  That's pretty good.  I like the groceries.  The groceries is pretty good, too.  Yeah.  The groceries?  I was raped in a car, and he was wondering what happened to the groceries.  What happened to the groceries?  What happened to the groceries?  You know what?  That might have to be the number one.  That is a good one.  What's the new one?  Such a dumb...  We got it right here.  Oh, good.  Let's hear it.  I think I put it on the level of how important is the board. 
[02:26:30]  This one?  I think so.  Wow.  All right.  So Larry King is doing an internet show right now.  Yeah.  I think it's on Hulu.  But it's doing well.  Yeah.  He's getting big guests.  He's still getting big guests interviewing people.  You can do a show on the internet that goes right to Hulu, right?  Oh, that makes sense.  Hulu.  That's what he's doing.  Is he doing it for Hulu?  Yes.  Oh.  I didn't realize.  How do you think it would happen with a great boxing champion?  This is a Dana White.  I don't think they would do.  It would last a minute ten.  It would.  Yeah.  It's just they're two totally different sports. 
[02:27:00]  I came from boxing.  It would be tough for our fighters to make a transition to boxing.  I mean, I want to know who Dana was fighting when that happens.  Oh.  I came from boxing.  Oh.  All right.  That's pretty good.  Jesus.  All right.  Very good.  Jimmy.  It would be tough for our fighters to make the transition to boxing, too. 
[02:27:30]  You know, if I took one of my guys and had him go over and fight a boxing match, you  know, they're two totally different sports.  How important are the feet?  They're absolutely not.  How important are the feet?  All of a sudden he's talking about a murder in South Africa.  Oh, my God.  But it's not a bad question, but it's just how he presents it.  It's totally a terrible question.  Because boxing, it's really important.  How important is foot speed?  Yeah, of course.  Of course. 
[02:28:00]  Foot coordination.  Kicking.  How important are the feet?  Of course.  Very.  How important are the feet?  They're absolutely important.  Well, I mean, if for no other reason, just walking and standing.  Good thinking.  Got him.  Is that wrong, Ryan?  The defense goes in, some of the escapes that you do when you're on the ground, takedowns,  kicks, all that plays a role.  Oh, no, that's Liz Karmouche.  Oh, Karmouche.  This was before the fight, obviously.  Karmouche?  I want to get Ronda Rousey in here.  Yeah.  She's very sexy. 
[02:28:30]  She got kicked in her titty.  Did she?  Did it hurt?  I don't know.  She survived.  She went on to win.  First round, another first round arm bar.  Seven in a row.  Did it go honk?  No, that would be funny.  A bunch of fucking milk shot out.  Oh, shit, Chip.  Yeah.  Do we have any other Larry King questions as we wait for Kevin Smith from the archives?  We haven't done this in a while.  You got the disc?  We have so many discs here.  We have, I have the board question loaded up here. 
[02:29:00]  Okay.  Yeah, let's hear that.  The board?  Oh.  To a skateboarder.  Boy, that's pretty great stuff.  Yeah.  How important is the board?  The board's one of the main things.  The board, the shoes, the wheels.  That's so dumb.  It all comes into play.  You want to feel comfortable with your entire setup.  The wheels.  Otherwise, it's just a block of wood.  Of course, the fucking wheels.  Well, he didn't want to answer that.  Yeah.  How important is the board?  Well, you can't just have wheels.  Is that what he does sometimes? 
[02:29:30]  Larry just comes out with things because he might not have a question on hand.  How important?  Yeah.  The feet.  Go.  Feet.  I also have the Roman Polanski clip.  Oh, that one was bad.  Yeah, let's hear this.  Joining Lauren Silver with us now is Deborah Tate, Roman Polanski's former sister-in-law,  the sister of the late Sharon Tate.  On a personal note, I knew Sharon Tate had interviewed her a couple of months before a tragic murder.  What do you want to see happen?  I would like to see this whole thing go away.  I think that there's been a lot of time that has passed, and we need to bring it to an end. 
[02:30:00]  You ever talked to Roman Polanski?  I have.  Wow.  How can you have a civil conversation with someone who so brutally murdered your sister?  Roman didn't murder my sister.  I mean, well, I'm sorry, but when the fact that he would have this terrible thing happen to him  after the death of your sister to once again focus you into the puppet.  Oh, and then he tries to cover up.  Oh, I don't have any problem. 
[02:30:30]  But what?  You just made a mistake.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, Larry.  It happens, right?  And then he's like, oh, no, what I meant was.  He didn't mean that.  It's my favorite moment in broadcasting.  That's a good one.  It's on the level.  I laughed as hard at that as I would have if it wasn't me saying Adam Walls.  Adam Walls.  If it had been somebody else, it would have been.  That's a bad one.  Yeah.  Take it after Larry King.  I guess so.  Adam Walls.  Adam Walls.  John, John.  Hi, John, John.  Hello, John. 
[02:31:00]  Jimmy just trying to clean up everything.  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy was fucking, I was Mike Mopp.  Yeah.  I want to hear that.  You're uncomfortable?  Oh, it was awful.  Oh, totally.  It's one of the cringiest moments I've ever had.  Because it wasn't just a mistake.  It was his dead son.  His decapitated son.  Oh, boy.  Like, you couldn't have mentioned a more painful name.  Yes.  Any other name would have been better.  Hey, Hitler Walsh.  Goebbels Walsh.  Nothing.  And it's how we start things.  We haven't built a repertoire.  Right.  Nothing.  Rape Walsh.  Wouldn't have been as harsh. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Corrected myself.  Oh, terrible.  They canceled the show?  Uh, I'm not sure if they canceled.  You can't cancel a show that captures criminals.  Apparently you can.  They canceled it on Fox, and then it moved to Lifetime.  I'm not sure if it's still on Lifetime.  Lifetime.  I watched it.  Lifetime.  They got Wiveswap on that channel.  I watch that shit every afternoon.  I bet there's a lot of crooks that don't give a shit that they're featured now.  Yeah.  No kidding.  Lifetime.  Who's watching?  No kidding.  Bunch of house frows.  Yeah.  Kevin just tweeted that he's calling us, so we're in a weird holding pattern. 
[02:32:00]  He just wrote, good S morning.  Does that mean smod morning?  Good S morning.  Oh, good S morning.  Everything has the Smod label, right?  Yeah.  That Kevin Smith on Twitter.  Good S morning.  In moments, I'll be calling into OP Radio and Anthony Comia.  Oh.  But to be fair, I'm only using them to get to Jim Norton.  Ah.  I'm very easy, Kev.  You just ask and I show up.  There you go.  So he should be calling any second here.  Okay. 
[02:32:30]  Talk Oscars and other shit.  Yes, because as we know.  Oh, everyone wants the Seinfeld clip.  We forgot about that one as far as Larry King goes.  Let me find that.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that is a good one.  Fuck.  That's funny.  Jerry just doesn't give him a fucking inch.  Oh, we got Kevin, though.  Oh.  We'll get to that in a second.  But first, Kevin Smith is on our phone line.  Hi, Kev.  Morning, folks.  Good morning, Kevin.  Happy post-Oscar day.  I mean, I know everyone's all happy and excited that both Anne Hathaway and Ben Affleck finally 
[02:33:00]  have their Oscars.  Yes.  That's pretty amazing.  Yeah, I mean.  That's not a convincing.  No, we're tired, man.  We stayed up way too late.  They've got to make that program shorter.  Yeah, well, the first thing they could have done was chop out the whole Captain Kirk thing  in the beginning.  Oof.  You didn't like it, huh?  It was fine, but it just went on.  A little too long.  On, yeah.  But hands down, the best joke of the night to me, and one that still makes me chuckle, 
[02:33:30]  is the Sound of Music joke.  I thought that was a story.  What was the joke?  Oh, I thought that was great, too.  I missed that one.  There was a joke where he was introducing Christopher Plummer.  Yep.  And he's like, you know, Christopher Plummer played Captain Von Trapp in the Sound of Music,  and he's like, and now the Von Trapp family singers, and they cut to some doors that didn't  open, and then they cut back to McFarlane on stage.  He's like, the Von Trapp family singers, and they cut back to the door, and nobody's there.  And then finally, like a dude in Nazi costume runs in, and he's like, they are gone! 
[02:34:00]  And he's like, that was fantastic.  And then they never touch again, and then he goes, and that was that joke.  Yeah, yeah.  That was fantastic.  That made me laugh so hard.  Probably the hardest I've ever laughed in an Oscar ceremony.  And then the second, I think the second most enjoyable aspect of the evening was Daniel Day-Lewis,  who was so serious all the time.  Yes.  And he's like a pretty funny charming guy.  And he's, yeah, he's being funny and shit.  Yeah, I thought that was cool.  Kevin, what did you think?  Like, now, I liked Argo, and I know you and Ben are very close. 
[02:34:30]  I saw your stream, sir.  You were very like, what?  It wasn't, but it wasn't like, fuck Argo.  I did think it was a great movie.  I liked you.  I think you summed it up best when you said, like, if they were giving away an award for  the third best movie of the year, then Argo should have won.  That's your tweet.  I loved it.  Of course, a friend of mine made it, but I'll be honest with you.  My favorite movie of the year was Life of Pi.  I didn't see that.  I thought it was beautiful.  It's crazy beautiful.  It's one of those movies that even if you're, are we allowed to curse?  I forget where I am.  Oh, yeah, let's do this.  Even if you're one of them pessimistic assholes, by the end of the movie, it finds, like, the 
[02:35:00]  child in you.  Like, the guy sums up the movie best when he's just like, he tells a story.  And then there's another story that you hear by the end of the movie that's probably the  more real version of the story.  But the guy goes, now, you've heard both stories.  Which do you prefer?  And then the guy says, well, the one that was this, I don't want to spoil it, but the  one with all the animals and stuff.  And then the guy says, like, and so it is with God. 
[02:35:30]  It's a really powerful flick.  Like, the CG work was phenomenal.  You're talking about, like, pretty much one actor alone with a bunch of CG.  And Rhythm and Hughes, the effects house that created all the tiger, all the animal stuff  and whatnot, all the whale jumping over the boat, all the amazing things you see in the movie,  just filed for bankruptcy recently.  Wow.  The guy who won the award last night for, I think it was for effects or visual effects.  I forget what he won exactly for.  But he was trying to give a shout out to Rhythm and Hughes. 
[02:36:00]  He might have been the DP who won for Life of Pi.  I can't remember.  But he was trying to give a shout out to Rhythm and Hughes and talk about, hey, man,  the VFX houses are hurting right now.  And they just kind of played them off.  I thought that the playoff music was funny.  They used Jaws.  Yeah, yeah.  But, like, if you're not doing a long opening dance sequence or a long singing sequence,  that guy could have said his two bits.  I mean, these cats work in their whole lives to get to the moment.  Well, maybe not.  Presumably they're not working their whole lives to get to this moment. 
[02:36:30]  But this is a big moment for you.  You win an Oscar.  You want to be able to stand up there and say whatever you want, even though half the  time they're like, oh, I'm so excited.  I forget who to thank.  But here's a guy who's prepossessed.  And he's like, look, I would like to talk about something that affects all of us in this  industry.  Like, turn up the music.  Get him off.  Did you like Zero Dark 30, Kevin?  I'll be honest with you.  And one of those things you're not supposed to say is a filmmaker.  People are like, oh, he's no filmmaker. 
[02:37:00]  Well, they've been saying that for years, so I guess I can go for it.  There are some flicks that I have not seen.  I abstained from voting this year because, number one, it was tough.  I had two people that I dearly love up for awards, man.  I love Affleck and I love Quentin Tarantino.  And me in the middle, I loved Life of Pi.  So I just abstained from voting altogether at that point.  Also, part of the reason was there's a bunch of movies that I didn't see and see till the  end.  So, like, you know, that's one thing they ask you to do.  They're like, look, if you haven't seen all the flicks, like, just don't go in there and 
[02:37:30]  be like, oh, I like this one.  It's better than this one, unless you've seen them all.  So some stuff I didn't see.  I'll go over to Best Pictures and tell you what I didn't see if I could find it.  So you were being honorable, because I would assume a lot of the people in the room would  just vote for their friends and pals.  Yeah, but, I mean, they tell you up and down, like, how important this is.  Like, in all the literature they send out, and let's be honest, it's not the end of the  world.  It's not, like, insanely important.  But they say, like, if you haven't seen all the flicks, you can't really vote. 
[02:38:00]  Because, like, let's say you've got ten Best Picture categories here.  Ten Best Picture nominations in the Best Picture category.  I didn't see them more.  I still haven't watched all of Lincoln.  I was watching the first 20, 30 minutes of that, and he was great, but then I fell  asleep.  But not because the movie was boring, but just because it was late at nine.  I was like, why the fuck am I trying to watch Lincoln at 12?  Yeah, yeah.  But to be fair, a lot of people have said that movie is really slow.  Yeah, a little long.  And it's not, Steven Spielberg, an insanely gifted filmmaker, but how many times are we  going to hear about Abe Lincoln, for heaven's sake? 
[02:38:30]  You know what I'm saying?  There's one more variation on the Abe Lincoln story, and you're like, all right, well, I'm  pretty sure.  And by the time, like, where I fell asleep in the movie, I was like, yep, this is everything  I knew about Lincoln up until now.  Let me ask you, are you surprised that Tarantino wasn't nominated for Best Director?  No, because I think with that flick, it would have been tough.  He was already catching some heat for using the N-word and stuff like that.  I think most cats think of him as a writer first and foremost. 
[02:39:00]  I think he thinks of himself as a writer first and foremost.  I don't think he seemed particularly bugged that he wasn't nominated.  I think in a world where, you know, Affleck didn't get nominated for directing Argo, I'm  sure.  Right.  It felt like, well, they missed a few of us this year.  Did you see, and I'm sorry to interrupt you, you saw Silver Linings Playbook?  I was just going down the list.  I've seen, of the rest of the movies, Les Miserables, I've seen Silver Linings Playbook  I have not seen yet, which I feel crappy about because my friend produced the movie, John  Gordon, the guy who made Red State with me, left us and went to make that flick. 
[02:39:30]  So my wife loved it.  Everyone I know loves it, but I've yet to watch it.  So I saw Les Miserables.  I still haven't seen Silver Linings Playbook.  Saw Django.  Did not see Beasts of the Southern Wild.  And to go way back to your question, Jimmy, I started watching Zero Dark Thirty, and it was  kind of the same situation as Lincoln.  I made it about 15 minutes in, and then I fell asleep because, and not because it's  boring, I'm like, Catherine Bigelow's a great director, but, you know, I've read every  article about the hunt for Bin Laden.  I didn't read the book, but I've read every article. 
[02:40:00]  I've read every article on the day of the actual strike and whatnot.  So by the time you're watching the movie, you're like, yep, I remember I read that.  Yep, this happened.  Yep, this happened.  So I fell asleep, and then I woke up just for the raid.  And when the raid happened, I was like, wow, this is exactly like every article I read.  So at that point, you know, it was a wonderful movie, but that was such a recent news event  that I was just like, I don't know, can you really dramatize something that's happened  like 10 minutes ago?  I liked it, but I just didn't finish it. 
[02:40:30]  The one part that the articles didn't tell you that was in the movies, that was when they  fucking broke into Bin Laden's fucking compound.  He was actually watching on a loop, my line in Zack and Miri, and laughing hysterically.  A lot of people...  Was he?  How great would that be if he was just looking at me and having a laugh?  I'd have to like him now.  So, uh, have you talked to Ben at all?  No, no, no.  I was going to text last night, like, that dude's phone is blown up and whatnot, so there's  no point in me going like, hey, congratulations as well. 
[02:41:00]  Could you go to the Oscars if you wanted?  Um, yeah, if you're allowed to buy a member of the Academy, so before the, when the nomination  ballot goes out and whatnot, uh, when they announce the nomination, I believe it's at  that point, you get a, uh, you could sign up for a ticket.  You gotta pay, though, and it's a crazy amount of money.  How much is it?  I think it was like, last time I looked at the price tag, I remember it being like 500  bucks, and I was like, 500 bucks, man, like, I would never want to go to something like 
[02:41:30]  this unless I was nominated.  It's not like going to a hockey game where you're like, I'm not playing the game, but  I enjoy watching hockey.  Like, I don't, I'm not playing this game, and I don't enjoy watching the award aspect  of it.  But like, it's not really what it's all about and whatnot.  Like, for example, last night, I think it took an hour or more into that ceremony for  anybody who got up to the podium to, you know, accept their award, brought up art.  And it was the dude who made the short documentary subject about the, she was a street 
[02:42:00]  musician or singer, and now, you know, she was like, she was homeless, she's an artist,  you're all artists, we do this for art.  That was, I was the one time I got emotional.  I was like, wow, here's somebody advocating for why we're all here in the first place.  Not to find out what someone's wearing, not to find out if this one's going to beat this  one, but like, to express oneself, you know, before we shuffle loose this mortal coil, to  say something, try to make your mark on the world with something unreal, tell the lie  that tells the truth kind of thing. 
[02:42:30]  So in that moment, where somebody's up there going, hey man, art, you know, the artist  in me is like, yeah, that's why we're all here.  But it quickly gets, you know, scuttled and everyone just gets up and goes, oh my god,  this means the world to me, me, me.  Well, so there's another one I wanted to ask you about, too.  God damn it, you just, we were talking about a movie, there was a movie I wanted to ask  you about, or a performance, and I fucking just, sorry.  Oh, Jimmy.  Yeah, I know, but as he was talking, my colleague had to ask him what he thought of this, but.  Oh, man.  No, it's not good.  I can, I could jump in with other stuff until you remember. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  Well, I will say Les Mis, I tried to get through, I got through 15 minutes of it, and I hate  music.  I like the first song, and the rest of it I just could not get into.  The, uh, it's a really sad movie, it makes you pretty emotional if you make it to the  end.  Really?  I'll try, I'll give it another shot.  If you're into sad stuff, like, I like getting emotional, and when I watch a flick now, I can  make myself laugh, and I've got friends who make me laugh, so I tend not to watch comedy  too much, but I love, I can't, you know, what I don't do is emotion very well, and I love  to watch that kind of stuff, so something like Les Mis, man, you know, by the time you 
[02:43:30]  get to the end of the movie, people are dying left and right, ghosts are talking to living  people about how well they've done with their life.  But it's a real, like, end-of-life movie, and you're like, oh my god, we're all gonna  die, I hope, Jesus, I hope, with a bad haircut, visits me on my desk, you know, it's very emotional.  But her performance in the first four minutes, like, not first four minutes, but in that song,  they have this song that she sings, I dream to dream, and everybody, of course, remembers 
[02:44:00]  the song from when the lady sang it in the British TV show, what's her, Susan Boyle, she  came out, and they're like, oh, she looks like a troll, and then this beautiful voice  came out of her, and I'm like, who knew that fat people could sing, some sort of revelation.  But anyway, that song was very popular by her, of course, it was from Les Mis, but when  Anne Hathaway sings it for the movie, I remember before I saw the flick, I was like, there is  no way, unless she's singing it, like, while juggling cats, and doing it completely naked, 
[02:44:30]  and riding a unicycle, how are you ever gonna forget the Susan Boyle version, man?  Like, especially all the elements that surrounded that, with, like, her coming out on stage,  and people not thinking she was gonna be able to pull it off, or do anything worthwhile.  So, knowing that, man, when Anne Hathaway steps up to the mic in the movie, I felt like  she had a huge hill to get over, and boy, did she do it easily.  They hold on her for four minutes, and she sings this song, they don't cut around, not 
[02:45:00]  made up of multiple takes, it's just her by herself with a camera hanging in her face,  singing from top to bottom of that song, and it's so emotional, dude.  Like, Anne Hathaway, um, I've read a little bit about her, she's certainly not, uh, she  hasn't had a life of misery and woe, but when you see her singing that song, you honestly  believe, like, oh my lord, she's been through fucking hell, man.  Really?  Somebody give this girl a break, and that's acting, like, if you could pull that crap  off, make me forget who you are in the real world, so much so that my heart's breaking 
[02:45:30]  for you as I watch this dopey little make-pretend movie, then you deserve an award.  That all being said, she's wonderful in the movie.  I thought her acceptance speech was the most disappointing of the evening.  Really?  I didn't see hers.  It fell flat.  I was getting jerked off for money.  Oh, yeah?  Jimmy goes, yeah, yeah.  For somebody who, like, you know, it was a big deal for her, it was a big deal for  everybody to win an Oscar, I guess, but, you know, she's well into acting, and she's  been, uh, doing fantastic performances for, like, the last five, seven years or whatever 
[02:46:00]  the heck.  Now she's, like, cruised up to her moment where she gets an Oscar, and her acceptance  speech was very perfunctory.  It was listing everybody.  It was a list of names of people who she was thanking.  Yeah, a lot of people do that.  It's like, no one cares.  You know, you want to do a little payback.  Yeah, but say something.  Yeah.  So many names, and nothing really about, like, you know, oh my God, when I was a little  kid, man, I, like, my whole life has been about this, I'll be honest with you, like,  all I've ever wanted was, just give me a little something up there, and, you know, instead 
[02:46:30]  it was like, you know, hopefully one day nobody will have to die in the French Revolution  ever again.  Yes, you did say that.  I mean, you know, it was kind of a weird thing, but I would have liked a better acceptance  speech from her.  This show is not about giving out awards for acceptance speeches, so it doesn't matter.  You just turned me on to Les Mis.  I think I've got to see this freaking movie now.  Now, but Kevin's maybe going to watch it from beginning to end.  I had no desire to see this.  I was watching it raked in a wheelbarrow.  I was like, oh, fucking hoop.  But I've got to watch it.  Kevin, what do you think of Seth MacFarlane's job there? 
[02:47:00]  As host.  Honestly, going in, I don't watch Family Guy, and he's taking a shot or two at me on the  show, so I'm not, you know, a wild, enthusiastic Seth MacFarlane supporter.  I'm not against him.  I just, he's not really in my world whatsoever.  So going into it, you know, I was just, I had my arms crossed, like, well, this better  be impressive.  I thought he actually did okay, man.  He made me laugh a few times.  I think he's easy to look at.  Damn, he's fucking like, he could sing and dance, and he's attractive.  He should be, I tweeted last night, that dude should be playing the lead in Book of Mormon, 
[02:47:30]  man, Elder Price.  He looks squeaky clean.  He looks the part.  He could sing.  He could dance.  He knows that.  He knows he has good timing and stuff.  I was pleased.  I mean, I wouldn't say, like, oh, man, I want to see him do it every year, but I thought  he acquitted himself admirably.  I thought the moments that, like, I liked, it felt like he brought.  I've never seen them do, like, you know, that sound of music type joke in the middle  of the show.  It felt like something he and his writers might have brought.  But when all things said and done, yeah, I thought he did totally fine. 
[02:48:00]  I mean, it was very Seth-heavy in the first 45 minutes with the song and whatnot, and the  song was pretty much about how bad he sucked at the Oscars or whatever, or the bit with  Captain Kirk, rather.  Yeah, yeah.  The song was more about boobs.  But everything else, I thought, like, when he came to the mic, you know, he did it.  I thought he did it well.  I don't know how else to say it.  Like, he had a big amount of snark, and I wouldn't say reverence, but like, yeah, we're  all here because these people are having a good time.  Yeah, he definitely did it.  I thought he did a good job. 
[02:48:30]  I'm not like, you know, oh, man, he better be the guy every time, or he's the brand new  Billy Crystal.  But I like Jon Stewart a lot from a few years ago, but I thought Seth did a really good job.  Did you like Michelle Obama presenting the, uh...  I actually like that.  I mean, I know Ant isn't crazy for her, but I like, uh, I like her a lot.  I mean, I think they're a good first family.  I mean, politics aside or whatever, but I enjoyed her.  I thought she was...  I agree, and she's coming off of, like, a real big week of being on that video with  Jimmy Fallon for Mom Dancing.  Yes.  So she's, like, riding a real heavy wave right now, a real high wave of popularity, and 
[02:49:00]  then all of a sudden she pops up on this.  I thought it was almost like, okay, poor Ben Affleck a couple years ago started getting kicked  in the balls because he dated somebody, and it got too public, and everybody got pissed  off.  And so for a while, he got...  His career was hurting, man, and he made reference to it when he won the award and stuff.  So for him to have not only a fairytale ending where, you know, the guy who everyone's like,  uh, he was in that fucking stupid Jersey Girl movie, fuck him in the ass, for that dude to, 
[02:49:30]  like, get up there and win an Academy Award and stuff, that's a fairytale ending.  The fact that it was given to him by the White House?  Come on, man.  That's like, that doesn't get more fairytale than that.  That's pretty damn special.  So I'm sure he's feeling like, after a few years of people being like, oh, fuck him,  now, you know, boy, you don't get more back than that.  So, and also a lot of people are like, oh, he didn't get nominated for the Best Director  Award.  I honestly think that probably helped his case a great deal.  Made a lot of people go like, hey, he should have been nominated. 
[02:50:00]  I'm not, certainly not saying, that's why I would go one, but it certainly created a  bunch of sympathy.  How rare is that, Kev?  Like, didn't it used to be the director and picture, you just got both?  That was the way it was.  I mean, it didn't happen with Scorsese, obviously, but.  Generally, they line up pretty well, but when the Academy jumped their awards to best picture  awards from 10 nominations from five to 10, but didn't jump all the rest of the awards,  suddenly you've got a huge discrepancy.  There's going to be 10 best picture nominations, but only five best directors. 
[02:50:30]  Now, this is certainly not the first time it's ever happened, even in the year when  there used to be five nominations, five best pictures and five best directors.  There have been plenty of times where directors didn't get nominated.  Bruce Beresford didn't get nominated for Driving Miss Daisy.  And that movie wound up winning best pictures, so it's kind of a similar situation.  But actors, it's strange because actors who become directors generally get love shot all  over them, man, like Robert Redford made the jump for Ordinary People, and he got awards. 
[02:51:00]  Kevin Costner, he got awards.  Mel Gibson, he got awards.  So it looked like for Ben, man, it was kind of going to be an easy layup.  But when he didn't get the director nod, suddenly people were like, oh, no.  But I honestly think that might have helped.  The Golden Globes were not too long after.  And the Globes organization, they're not like the Academy has an accountancy firm of Price  Waterhouse that counts all the ballots and the votes like that.  And everybody who's a member sends in their vote.  And if you're a member of a branch, like I'm a member of the director's branch, you vote 
[02:51:30]  for Best Picture and Best Director.  That's who you get to nominate.  And then when they release all the nominations, you get to vote for everything.  So the Golden Globes, that's an organization that's a closed organization run by the Hollywood  Foreign Press.  And so the Hollywood Foreign Press is like an organization that looks like, I've been  in front of them a few times, looks like about 100 people, maybe less, generally on the older  side and whatnot.  And they write for publications that are overseas that you've never seen or heard about.  So this organization doesn't have like, hey, all our members voted. 
[02:52:00]  Their voting body is made up of those journalists, those people who write for the Hollywood Foreign  Press.  So when they vote for their awards, the Golden Globes, it's not like, hey, man, we send our  numbers to the accountant and the accountant sends them all back and tells us exactly who  went.  They just pick.  So Ben kind of got dissed for his Best Director nod a couple of weeks before the Golden Globes  happened.  And then he won Best Director at the Golden Globes.  So they can change horses in midstream.  Wait, Kevin, hold on, jump in. 
[02:52:30]  Do you have, when you're meeting this Hollywood Foreign Press, isn't it a big like ass kiss  fest?  Like you have to hang out with them a certain thing, you go to lunch with them.  Isn't it like a whole fucking interaction that these guys have to do for nominations?  There is an interaction.  You just certainly don't have to do it.  When I worked with Miramax and the Weinstein Company for years, they, of course, they excel  at awards and whatnot.  So I had to do it a few times during that.  What you do is it's a press conference.  You show the movie and you sit down in some hotel ballroom with about 50 of the Hollywood 
[02:53:00]  Foreign Press or something like that.  And they're very familiar faces.  If you've done it once or twice, you'll see the same people over and over and whatnot.  So you sit down and they ask you questions.  It's a Q&A type situation or press conference kind of situation.  You chit chat with them and then you go.  There have been some people in the past like Sharon Stone back in the day would send them  all monogrammed pens and stuff like that.  Very expensive payola type things.  And then they got rid of that. 
[02:53:30]  They were like, you can't give gifts during award season.  Right.  But you don't have to.  It's not like jump through these hoops with these people.  But if you want to win a Golden Globe, that's definitely part of it.  I mean more of an unspoken rule.  Like not one that will be written down, but one where we all kind of know.  You know, I mean like one of those things.  Yeah.  Nudge, nudge.  Yeah, sure.  And that's the only organization that you can really do it with.  Like the Academy, there's nobody you can buddy up with because it's all votes from the  membership.  So you'd have to buddy up with everybody in the membership to sway your vote.  With the Golden Globe people, yeah, there's a certain amount of them. 
[02:54:00]  And I guess if you ingratiate yourself with them, they probably remember you more fondly  than the people that don't.  Hey, Kev, could you settle something for me, please?  Fire away, brother.  Who was the best singer of the night?  Okay.  We've been discussing this this morning.  And I'm not talking about the musical montage.  Okay, so wait, so tell me who my options are.  You got the Jennifer Hudson, you got the Adele, you got the Barbara, the Babs, and you got  that Shirley, oh, shoot. 
[02:54:30]  The older lady.  Bassie.  Bassie, thank you.  Yes.  And you got Bassie.  Who was the best of the night?  Let me see.  Thinking about it.  Honestly, like I thought Jennifer Hudson, when she sang her number, she literally brought  the house down and brought everyone, well, not literally, figuratively, but she literally  brought everyone to their feet, like it was a standing O. And it felt like it was the  end. And you're sitting there going, is it a two-song montage? But it was so big that  you were like, who's going to follow this? And then the only way to top that was to bring 
[02:55:00]  up the entire cast of Les Miserables to do that song from the middle of the movie.  So at that point, you know, oh my Lord, you're watching Jennifer Hudson sing by herself versus  30 people singing about the French Revolution. So I'd say it was between those two, but I'll  give it to Jennifer Hudson because a woman alone on a stage singing the song that made  her famous, that she's won awards for and whatnot, in front of that crowd, she didn't  really, I thought she did a great job. I brought her up to a close second. And again, like 
[02:55:30]  I'm not, it doesn't come because I'm like, I'm a huge fan of this guy. But I thought, I  was blown away at what a good singer Seth MacFarlane was.  Wow. I just got faced. I said the Goldfinger Broad.  What?  Shirley Bassey?  Yeah, man. She's 78 years old. She belted it out.  That was cool. Yeah, I mean, I told you.  You have no idea. I mean, we've been kind of battling this back and forth all morning and  Sam said Hudson, and I said the Goldfinger Broad.  The Goldfinger.  I'd be absolutely great for her because, as you said, she's older. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, man, I'd lost so bad.  But at the same time, you know, I've heard that song a billion times, and you know, it's  a wonderful song, but it's not that difficult to sing.  She did good for an old lady.  The other song is really difficult, and you've got to like get way, you know, Christina Aguilera  with it at the end, where you're like, yeah, ooh, that kind of stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  You've got to sting a little bit.  I hear you.  Well, very good, Kevin.  Anything else about the Oscars?  I don't know.  I think you covered it.  I think it looks like it felt, honestly, like this year, everybody, they spread the, shared 
[02:56:30]  the wealth, if you will, or spread it around evenly.  Nothing really.  Everybody who was up for something walked away with a little something.  You know, even Lincoln wound up walking away with Daniel Day-Lewis to take the top acting  award, and Steven Spielberg doesn't get director, but that goes to Ang Lee.  So Life of Pi gets a little love, gets a little love for Score, gets a little love for  cinematography.  Argo gets a lot of love, wins the top award, man.  Wins screenplay as well, or adopted screenplay.  Yeah, Hollywood's got to like that, when they spread it out like that. 
[02:57:00]  Do you think that has anything to do, like, I went to the ten nominations instead of five.  Obviously, it gets people to see more movies.  So I want, because nobody gives a fuck who's nominated for Best Director.  Nominated for Best Picture, people go, hey, let's go see it.  It's nominated for an Oscar.  I wonder if spreading it out like that is an unspoken, I'm not saying nothing can sweep.  Like, you know, but, hey man, if you spread it out, everything can now say, with Oscar winning,  Oscar for Best, and you want to see movies that have Oscar attached to them. 
[02:57:30]  So maybe it just gets everybody a little bit more money.  I mean, and again, in the sea of Hollywood stuff, you know what I mean?  Absolutely.  I mean, sure, more awards spread around is probably better for the business in general,  because it means, like, if it's one flick that's getting all the awards, once you see  it, you're done.  But if it's like, hey, there's ten movies that are getting really talked about, each one  won awards, then you're more inclined to check them all out.  There you go.  But honestly, when it comes to that, and I'm certainly not an Apple polisher for the Academy, 
[02:58:00]  Yes, you are, Apple polisher!  I am a total Apple polisher.  You're the gatekeeper.  But I can't, I mean, of course, anything could be cheated in this world, but the way they  do it, their balloting and their voting, man, is pretty, it's pretty on the money.  It's pretty, like, airtight.  I mean, they introduced some online voting system this year, which challenged a few people,  some of the older voters, I guess.  But generally speaking, like, they use Pricewaterhouse, and there's not, there's not like, hey, man,  I'm the vice president of Hollywood, and I want this movie to win, you know, unless you 
[02:58:30]  count Harvey Weinstein.  You can't really fuck with the system.  The system is, it's, I'm not going to say it's perfect, but it can't be like, hey, well,  let's spread a little over here, spread a little over here.  But nobody's in charge of the voting body itself.  So there's no, like, you know, unless, you know, I'm being naive, and there's somebody,  there's Illuminati, Hollywood Illuminati, sitting in a room, you know, like the stonecutters  on The Simpsons, deciding who wins the fucking Oscar. 
[02:59:00]  But I don't, everything I've seen over the course of the last nearly 20 years dictates  to me that it's a pretty, it's a pretty straight up process, man, you can't fuck it, or something  like that.  All right.  All right, buddy.  Well, thank you, Kevin.  Yeah, absolutely.  You really broke, great on us, and, uh.  Yeah, you broke it down for us.  I appreciate it.  I try to be a little helpful and stuff, man.  But it's, it's cool.  It's now, it's done, and we get to go back to just watching movies instead of, you know,  politicizing or betting them.  I like, I, I hate this time of year because it turns the movies into a hockey game where  you're just like, yeah, man, beat them up. 
[02:59:30]  I want to see competition.  I thought that was really amazing.  Quentin's, during Quentin's speech, he actually, like, he said, I love the competition.  Like, he likes to get in there and be up against people and stuff like that.  I'm the opposite.  I hate the, any aspect of competition.  It's like, oh, no, man, it's art.  Don't make us, like, compare our art.  It's like comparing dick sizes.  You can't do it.  You're born with what you're born with and stuff.  I know, but it is fun to humiliate the other guy.  Let me rephrase. 
[03:00:00]  That's why Quentin liked it.  He was just like, I love the competition because I fucking won.  Yeah.  Did he mean I love the competition like I love to compete or I love the competition like  I love the people I'm competing against?  I think both.  That dude fucking loves the process, man.  Like, I remember I was sitting on a, here, I'm going to name drop like a motherfucker.  I was sitting on a balcony with him right before he went to go do In Glorious Bastards.  And he was coming off of a movie that I loved, man, of, what was it called? 
[03:00:30]  Grindhouse.  You know, he did the car one in Grindhouse.  So I guess Grindhouse didn't do that well.  It topped out at like 30 million bucks or something and was considered kind of disappointing.  And that dude, like, it bothered him in a big, bad way, man.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, he was like, I'm going over to Germany early, man.  I'm going to get started, work on my craft.  He's going, because I'm going to come back and show him how big my dick is.  And I was like, really?  But everyone knows how big your dick is.  He's like, well, not now, not after Grindhouse.  But when I come back, they're going to fucking know.  And then he came back and it was In Glorious Bastards.  What confidence to know that? 
[03:01:00]  What confidence he has in his ability to write and love him and tell a story.  Love the guy.  It's his whole world, dude.  It's his whole fucking world.  If you walk into his house, his whole world is movies and storytelling.  So it kind of makes sense.  When he steps up to the plate, he has a full game in his head.  He's like, Gretzky, dude.  He sees the whole life, and he sees the whole game, and he sees every play before it kind  of happens.  So I was up there at his place.  I showed him Red State.  It was going back a year and a half, two years ago.  And he was coming out of writing.  So he was into, he was like, I just spent the last two weeks or two months writing. 
[03:01:30]  I haven't watched anything.  So now I'm trying to watch as much as I can.  And he has a movie theater.  So he runs prints and stuff like that.  So they had called up and said, hey, man, send me the print of Red State so I could  see it.  And so I went up there to watch it with him.  And then afterwards, he was just hanging around the house.  He goes, this is this room.  This is this room.  And he goes, come here.  I want to show you something.  And he pulls me into his writing room.  He's got this beautiful view of Los Angeles out his window where he just sits there and  sees the city at night and stuff.  Very great view because he lives up in the hills. 
[03:02:00]  He lives like in the hills above me, above Mulholland.  So he goes, come here, look.  And he brings me over.  And there's the he goes, here it is.  And it's the script.  And there it is.  Django Unchained.  He's like, I just finished it.  I'm so excited.  He's like, that's the only reason I'm watching movies right now is because I'm done making  mine.  So he's like a kid, man.  He's so fucking enthusiastic.  And he plays the game for real.  Like, this is what you love about artists and entertainers, athletes, people that do something  ridiculous like throw a ball around or make pretend for a living or put images together 
[03:02:30]  that make you think something's really happening.  The people that do it full out with all of their passion do it like they're trying to  save the fucking world.  Like, if I don't get this right, everyone dies.  People who create their art like they're fucking Batman.  And they got five seconds to get a bomb out of there or something like that.  That, to me, those are the people who always have my heart, man.  Those are the people who hook me.  And Quentin is definitely one of those people.  Like, this is not just like, yeah, I work in the movie business.  Just fucking religion, man.  And he plays it like that. 
[03:03:00]  And not to say he's all austere and serious.  He's obviously a fun-loving dude.  But, like, he treats his craft more reverently than I ever could.  To him, it's fucking religion.  It's manna from heaven.  It's how he breathes and stuff.  It's how his heart pumps.  So when a dude like that gets up to accept an award, you know that, like, not only has  he earned it, and I'm not saying he earned it and no one else who was up for the award  would have earned it.  No, but this guy, it is everything that he is.  It's every part of his fucking being.  So when he closes that loop, when he stands up there and accepts an award for writing 
[03:03:30]  something that meant the world to him, that he took all his time with, he doesn't write  on a computer.  He writes fucking longhand.  Yeah.  I think he told us.  I'm a fucking maniac.  Fucking crazy.  He's an artist.  He's not really a maniac.  He's like one of these guys we'll be talking about years from now, like Samuel Clemens or  Mark Twain, if you will, or any of the greats, man, who are just a little bit eccentric.  His, for his whole life, his art has been first.  He feels connected to the page by writing.  Some guy, I think Woody Allen writes like that, too, or he's a typewriter. 
[03:04:00]  There's all these weird things that make people feel connected to the page.  Like, you know, with me, I just kind of watch Comedy Central and then rephrase what I've  heard.  That's what makes me feel connected.  All right, we got to wrap up.  Yeah, right on.  We're closing the show in 15 minutes.  Good talking to you.  Hey, this Friday, we're going to drop a trailer for Jay and Silent Bob's super groovy cartoon  movie.  It's a movie like Red State.  I took out and toured, me and Jay made this movie.  Jay actually did.  It's a cartoon movie of Jay and Bob, and we're going to take that out, touring it.  And on Friday, the trailer and the dates get announced. 
[03:04:30]  Ah, very cool.  All right, thank you, brother.  Definitely.  All right, guys.  Have fun.  See you soon.  Bye.  Bye.  Our pal, Kevin Smith.  There you go.  He's got a great take on shit.  And that Tarantino stuff was really interesting.  Absolutely.  It's nice to know, like, the directors will sit and, you know, fucking talk, and the one  director gets excited.  Like, I would never show Tarantino my movie.  I'd be too, like, ashamed that he wouldn't like it.  He should be.  But he just, you're right.  It's fair enough.  He just brought us into Quentin Tarantino's house right there.  Yeah.  You can just visualize that whole thing, how he said that. 
[03:05:00]  Very good.  That Kevin Smith on Twitter.  We're going to take a break, and we'll wrap up today's show.  I want to thank Kevin Smith for calling in.  Breaking it down for us. 
[03:05:30]  What happened with James Franco?  Is there a big deal, Howie, did the Daytona 500 start?  First of all.  Why?  I want to comment on the Kevin Smith interview.  Yeah, what's up?  You think that maybe you guys were liking the lady because she was old, and I was the  one who was looking at it open-mindedly now?  No, no.  Me and Kevin Smith are both ageist.  Just because he agrees with you doesn't mean that's what happened.  You said I was ageist.  No, Jimmy said that. 
[03:06:00]  Yes.  I just think you're stupid.  Fucking all-run youth.  Thank you.  Yeah, no.  James Franco.  Just because Kevin Smith agrees with you, it hurt a little, but I could go to my Twitter  and say that, yeah, I picked the right singer last night.  Yeah, but your Twitter followers all sound like that guy.  No, they don't.  Only a small percentage.  And then you point out those guys get really mad, I noticed.  They do?  They don't like the voice.  What do they say?  They get really mad.  They pick up on maybe it's them? 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  I think they're like, wait a minute here.  So then they try to make it hurt extra, extra more.  Does it?  Yeah.  No, no, no.  No, it doesn't.  You guys going to Tom's tonight, by the way?  No, no.  I don't believe in it.  All right.  What about that?  I want to go.  It's a fun time.  I want to go, but when, what time is it?  Seven.  Because I'm going to just sleep like a motherfucker.  Yeah, I might.  I don't know.  I either could put on the white hat or the black hat.  The white hat is go to meditation and work on myself, or put on the black hat and hang 
[03:07:00]  out with, like, comics that are all fighting addictions.  You'll have much more fun at the Tom Popper.  What?  Where is it?  Is it a good time?  Jimmy, I've never gone.  Not the exact address, but he's, I'll tell you.  It's in a city.  It's in Manhattan.  You got to stay in.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm just wondering.  You got to go downtown a little bit.  It's in Manhattan.  South of here?  Yes.  Or, you know, Westchester.  Is it a good time?  Tom Popper puts on a good shindig?  Yeah, I will say this.  Tom puts on a good fucking get-together. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah?  It's in Manhattan on the west side.  It's on, I'll tell you the street.  Some snobbery?  The street.  Okay.  It's a little downtown?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, we did discuss the cheese platter on Friday, so.  It's very good.  He has the wheel.  Yeah, he said he has good snacks.  He said he's going to have the wheel of cheese, the cheese wheel.  And Roland said he's going and is going to make sure that the snacks are to his- 
[03:08:00]  Oh, boy.  Liking.  Yeah.  And he has high standards as far as snacks.  Roland, where's my Sunday gravy?  What's going on?  You're asking that every day.  Because I want it.  It's coming.  Because March is meatballs.  What?  March is meatball month.  March is meatball month?  March is meatball month?  No, it's not.  Is that true?  Who said that?  Who decided?  Probably some meatball salesman.  Yeah, yeah.  I bet that there's a line some fucking door-to-door meatball salesman used.  He took, like, over his briefcase and put meatballs on it. 
[03:08:30]  You can't just decide March is meatball month.  The Irish are going to be pissed.  The Irish are going to have something to do with, you know, to say about that.  Because St. Paddy's Day?  Yeah, man.  St. Paddy's Day at Hunch, you know.  Sunday gravy.  Let's get that done.  Really, the best shit in New York.  And then the meatball guys are good, too.  But that's another place, right?  Yeah.  Meatball month.  March.  But who are the meatball guys?  It's not meatball month.  That's a fucking lie by the meatball industry. 
[03:09:00]  No.  It's a conspiracy.  No, the meatball people are coming from March.  They said it's their meatball month.  What's their name?  So they get a quick plug over.  So I get some free meatballs.  Um, oh shit, I forgot their names.  All right, but we know Sunday gravy.  Yeah.  They have the best spaghetti sauce, but they have to call it gravy, because that's what  the Italians call it.  I never fucking...  You didn't go with that gravy shit?  Never.  There was always sauce in your house?  Sauce is sauce.  Gravy is gravy.  Ah, sauce, gravy, all tastes good to me.  What the hell do I know?  Hey, regular Joe, shut the fuck up. 
[03:09:30]  Ah, you know what?  You dip it in sauce, I dip it in gravy.  Who knows?  We're all dipping bread over here.  What do I know?  Ah, get the hell out.  Let the Russians figure it out.  Let the Russians figure it out.  Yeah, you worry about that, I gotta get my bills paid.  Does Con Ed care?  I don't think so.  What the hell do I know over here now?  Regular Joe.  You don't like meatball month?  Meatball month, what do I know?  Is that gonna make my rent any cheaper than I like meatball month?  If not, the hell with it.  What do I know?  It's always about the struggle regular Joe has, but it's alright, because, you know, 
[03:10:00]  that's life.  Yeah, meatball month.  That means probably all the bosses get involved, right?  Bunch of meatballs.  Give me a container of coffee.  I gotta run this place.  That's the extent of regular Joe's sense of humor, by the way.  That's it.  That's a big joke right there.  Yuck.  Yeah.  Hated working with them.  They'll be delicious when they come.  Regular Joe's.  Yeah, but you can't have a whole month dedicated to the meatball.  There's too much stuff out there.  We only have 12 months.  You can't just say, alright, meatball, you get marks. 
[03:10:30]  That's not fair.  Yeah, what, a spaghetti in February?  That's shorter.  I'll bet you someone's getting the short end of the stick, and it's usually me.  What the hell do I know?  Go ahead, Raul.  Meatball week.  Raul?  So, what?  February's Black History Month, and March is Meatball Month?  Yeah, we go Black History Month to Meatball Month?  That's kind of a drop-off.  Yeah, what about that?  The next Tuesday starts tomato week.  Go ahead.  Your turn, Raul.  Talk.  Raul.  What do I know?  Raul.  Well, if we're going to talk about food, we could certainly talk about Bloomberg.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:11:00]  What's he up to now?  You know the soda ban?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's also going to ban two-liter sodas with pizza orders.  So, what do you mean?  You order pizza?  You order pizza, you're like, hey, you got some fucking soda around.  We got some people that are thirsty.  Oh, God.  He's such a fucking...  So, what?  You got to...  So, how is that going to work?  I'm wondering...  You got to order individual sodas for everybody in your house?  I wonder if that was an intentional thing or if that's just collateral damage.  Like, do they mean to say you can't order takeout soda, or are they saying that's just 
[03:11:30]  like a technicality because of the law?  Um...  Oh, boy.  I want to look her out there, huh?  She just...  I saw what happened there.  Why?  You're feeling good about yourself right now, aren't you?  Why?  She gave you a little nod.  Almost a wink.  I gave a little nod.  No way.  What was that about?  Oh.  They're laughing at our side.  What the hell are these guys doing out here?  Pretty bunch of girls.  Hey.  Tombstone in the window that says, don't go...  Here lies hope.  Who's the blonde girl?  They're laughing at it.  Who are they?  Who's the blonde girl?  They work for... 
[03:12:00]  Who's the blonde girl?  Yeah, Pete Dominic.  What?  Really?  Yeah.  The blonde girl?  What does she do for Pete Dominic?  I don't know, but she was his intern a while back.  Ask her if she wants to move to a much bigger radio show.  Where are you going to send her?  Money fence.  Oh, can you get some news?  She is very cute.  It's a human resources tour, taking new employees on a tour.  Oh, thank God.  I was so close to saying who are the broads.  Wow, that would be bad.  That would be an hour meeting. 
[03:12:30]  Human resources?  Which one's human resources?  Yeah, which one is the...  They have nice stems on her.  The dark-haired one with the glasses was the human resources.  Oh, she looks fun.  Yeah, they bring them around, then they bring them down to security to get their ID cards.  Oh, my God, really?  It's like a hell of a day.  We've never met the HR people.  Well, they pointed to this.  They said, now, this little area...  Is what you don't want.  You want to avoid, like, an exploded septic tank.  Oh, yeah.  I want to ask the human resources people, are they telling you to avoid us? 
[03:13:00]  Yeah.  Are you guys telling them to avoid us?  You think human resources is glad that they bring new employees around and they stop at  a window to look at a tombstone that says SiriusXM, here lies hope?  Yeah.  Now, that's not true, and they've been talked to about that.  No, we're very hopeful here.  We have a lot of hope here.  Shut it.  Especially if you're being harassed.  Harassed.  Oh, I hate when people say harassed.  It makes me sick to my stomach.  Say it like we all do.  Human resources.  As opposed to, what, the furniture?  What the hell do I know, Greg? 
[03:13:30]  They don't like harass, because it sounds like harass.  That's more fucking harassment.  You think that's where that came from?  I bet.  I bet you.  You're right.  But they don't like harass.  Harass.  Because it's harass.  Harass.  And that's Harris.  Harris.  Yeah, but then harassment, then you're like, well, what did Harris say?  Andrew had a joke about that back in the day.  Did he?  Yeah.  Her ass meant I should fuck it.  But Dice did it in joke form. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah.  It was funny.  It was very funny.  Did anyone ever hear from Dice, by the way, after that gay day?  Nope.  No.  The last gay day?  Didn't even say goodbye.  He went out.  He didn't come back.  I understand why he didn't come back.  I did, too.  He didn't even say goodbye.  Yeah, he went out for a ciggy.  Who the hell knows?  He's like a father running out on his kids.  It was really bad.  He's going out for a cigarette, Jr.  Or a mom.  Goodbye.  Sorry, Trav.  No, it's all right.  Oh, yeah, he's just going out for some fucking kugel.  I'm going to go out and have a kugel. 
[03:14:30]  I'll be back in 30 years.  I feel guilty every time I tease poor Trav.  Oh, it's terrible.  You shouldn't.  No, I'm going to continue to do so.  Oh, good.  But I feel guilty.  I hope so.  It's been 11 years.  I'm over it.  People are salespeople now.  Oh, good.  Sales weasels.  Salespeople.  There's a show we'll never sell.  Yeah, yeah.  You can just ignore this area.  Yeah, just get fucking, you know, if you could sell some kind of a dick cream, maybe  we could get a dick cream on the show.  Yes, sir. 
[03:15:00]  Boston is, I believe, sold out very, very quickly, both shows.  Very cool.  That's nice.  There might be 20 tickets left.  I don't know.  Greg Brady looking motherfucker.  Jesus.  And I'm this weekend in the Poconos at Poconuts.  Friday, Saturday only.  Poconuts.  Working on my new hour.  Oh.  They just hired John Daly?  I knew Travis would get that one.  Oh, he's got a big-on shirt.  Holy fuck.  That's a dead ringer for John Daly.  John Daly and Greg Brady.  Yeah, throw a mustache on him, and that's John Daly. 
[03:15:30]  Holy fuck.  Hey, can we get John Daly on the show?  Rolling.  I'm sure we could.  I love him.  He's got, like, truck stop pizza.  I don't think we should have him on that much.  Oh.  Daly.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  I think we should go home.  Oh, boy.  I don't know what was work.  What was work?  Jimmy.  That was a Freudian slip.  Of course you don't know work.  They did a hard day's work in your life. 
[03:16:00]  Oh, God.  Am I right or wrong, Trav?  Regular Joe.  Wrong, I guess.  I hope for a job site accident.  The nail gun.  Plenty of them.  You know what?  You don't work union, you get job site accidents.  Good point, Ant.  What the hell do I know?  People hate regular Joe.  Oh, they do.  Oh, it's an ass.  What a dullard.  We learned about the meatballs.  March is Meatball Month.  Hey, Roland, what do you think of the Oscars?  You're a movie guy.  Oh, yeah, Roland.  Yeah, let's wrap up our Oscar coverage with something from you. 
[03:16:30]  You owe somebody lunch, huh?  Oh.  I do.  Who was the best singer last night?  I love Adele.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can't go wrong with the Adele choice.  I said that was the best.  Yeah, and then I loved Jennifer Lawrence, too, and Hathaway.  I loved Lady Miz.  It was a good movie.  Woo.  I want to see it again.  Why was Lady Miz good?  It's like a musical sad chick flick.  Well, you know what?  All right.  That's a good review.  He's not wrong.  Yeah, because she goes, my hair will go. 
[03:17:00]  That should be a slug line for the movie poster after the re-release.  What about Silver Linings Playbook?  I haven't seen that one.  That's the only one I haven't seen yet.  What about Argo?  What was that about?  I didn't know it was a true story.  It wasn't.  You watched the movie.  Somebody tweeted something funny about it was about a boring movie about six Americans  standing in a line.  That really is what Argo was about.  That's pretty much what it was.  Yeah.  They had a great plan if they needed it.  They didn't.  Yeah.  That's pretty much what happened.  Basically, I created a...  I'll say it again. 
[03:17:30]  Thanks to my manager for pointing out, it was Hollywood rewarding the contribution of Hollywood.  Exactly.  What was Argo about to you, Brolin?  Just the people talking politics and fires were on the streets and shooting people and  stuff.  I'm very good.  I see that.  What about Lincoln?  Oh, that was too long for me.  Yeah.  But then you don't even see him get shot, though.  You just see him laying in bed.  He never got shot. 
[03:18:00]  That's why you didn't see him get shot.  That doesn't exist.  Shoot that piece of shit.  He was like, Lincoln's dead.  I'm like, that's it.  Three hours?  That's it?  Why wouldn't they show him getting shot?  What's that about?  Just an artistic choice because it's been done so many times and they misled you.  You're in the theater and somebody yells so you see the kid's reaction instead.  In Lincoln, they go to the theater and you hear somebody's on the stage so you think  he's about to be killed.  Spoiler alert.  But it's really somebody making the announcement that he's been shot in another theater. 
[03:18:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  How many plays are going on in one night?  Oh, it was fucking...  Well, they were on what they called Play Square, where there was a bunch of plays happening.  It was long.  Too long.  Oh, I do believe...  Oh.  Yes, it was Our American Cousin, but then there was another play that was going on down  the street.  Yeah.  That must have been the one.  Yeah.  Should have gone to that one.  What about...  Yeah, you should have went to that one.  What about one more?  Life of Pi.  I didn't see that.  It looked too confusing. 
[03:19:00]  You live it.  Oh.  I do.  Jesus.  Yeah.  There's a bunch of animals and people in water.  I'm like, whatever.  I want to see it, but it's so annoying knowing it's CGI.  Not that it's annoying.  You know, I guess a lot of movies are, but I want to see the fucking kid petting a real  tiger for people.  It's all CGI.  You know how long they would have to wait around to get a whale to jump over the boat?  That's a good point.  It probably would have taken quite a while.  Throwing fish up in the air for weeks.  Yeah.  Just trying everything. 
[03:19:30]  We can't get this goddamn whale out of the water.  We can't even get one to go to break on time.  Oh.  That's all right.  Oh.  Eric Nagel.  He drives them both, though.  Pretty cool, huh?  I didn't mean that.  Pretty cool.  I'm bipolar.  Oh, look at this.  What, are we going to be bushwhacked when we fucking leave?  Can I do a line of the day?  Oh, yeah.  Whack the rest of us, too.  Do we have lines of the day?  Three runners up.  Holy fuck.  For real?  Funny show.  If you want to go to a meeting, I can just go down the line.  Fair enough, Elon. 
[03:20:00]  Point made.  Sam will do line of the day.  But it is brought to you by Mask Sexual Flavors, the new way to foreplay.  Available in four tantalizing flavors.  These oral gel strips will be the spark to light your bedroom flame.  Visit sexualflavors.com to purchase or find a retailer near you.  We'll see you tomorrow.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live. 
[03:20:30]  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  It's a really fucking annoying replay promo.  Yeah, it is.  That's way worse.  Any of the commercials that ever get complained about that are on the channel,  are all better than that replay promo.  How long is it?  It's just shy of a minute.  Why would it be that long?  Just, I guess, to fill time.  What do we need to fill time for?  Sometimes we've got to fill time in between breaks.  So we made a longer one.  I mean, all that does is make me say,  you know what, I enjoyed the show today, 
[03:21:00]  and I was going to listen to the replay to check out what I didn't hear,  and now I'm not going to.  In case that promo gets replayed on the replay,  I need to avoid that at all costs.  Because I just feel like a minute of my life was robbed from me.  Like, I feel like I underwent a rape for 60 seconds.  Oh, you have very shallow skin.  Yeah.  It affects me, E-Rock.  These things affect me a lot.  It's invasive.  You understand that radio is a medium that seeps into your life,  and when you have something like that on, 
[03:21:30]  it invades your life.  It's an invasive thing.  It's a minute long,  and he's just saying replay over and over again.  Tell him to knock it off.  Like hits one.  I'm tired of hearing about it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's what it sounds like.  We were making fun of hits one.  Coming up next.  It's coming up next.  Right, because Spider Harrison on the weekend countdown,  I heard it.  It must have played all weekend.  He left all of his takes.  They left all of his takes in the one shot.  So he said coming up next like four times in a row. 
[03:22:00]  And I was like, this is supposed to be hits one.  It's supposed to be quick.  But then I put my headphones on,  and I thought you were doubling up the brakes or something.  I was about to yell at you because I was like,  this can't possibly be a real thing that's going on.  They just keep saying replay over and over again.  Well, it's after Opie and Anthony.  There you have it.  Yeah.  I'm glad we got to the bottom of that.  It's just a horrible, horrible replay promo.  It's after Opie and Anthony live.  We got early callers.  302, you're on the air. 
[03:22:30]  Hello, Sammy.  What's up, buddy?  My man is Hollywood, primetime.  Sammy Sweetheart, BF and Roberts, professional broadcast.  This is Larry.  Yes, of course it is.  Of course it is.  I really am kind of chagrined.  I perhaps have been calling your openers ham and eggers.  And when I realized, in hindsight, the level of security they required to protect the precious  cumia wing-wag, that perhaps they're that much bigger a deal than I was making out, 
[03:23:00]  and I perhaps owe them an apology.  Well, I got to tell you, I think they will accept that.  But, to my eyes, there was no bathroom escorts today.  The place was secured well as it always was, but they were able to get by like your average  Joe's.  Do we have line of the day to play today?  Yes, I just have it loaded.  Okay.  Three runners up, right?  Yes.  All right, let's hear the first runner-up for line of the day.  Is that hat with the big selling point for that hat, was it will stop a bullet in its  tracks, and that just kind of wrecked their marketing campaign. 
[03:23:30]  Did it?  Yeah.  That was Lincoln, of course.  We were talking about how horrible his hat was, and I guess that would defeat the purpose  of that marketing campaign.  Let's hear the next one.  It's forever ruined.  Well, is it really ruined, though?  Yes.  Okay, good.  That, of course, was our in-depth Virgil analysis.  It's been a long time since we had our Virgil update on the show.  For those of you that missed it, I don't know if you want to post it on the Facebook, but 
[03:24:00]  the photo...  It's up there.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, right when we were talking about it, I put up LonelyVirgil.net.  Yeah, LonelyVirgil.net has all the Virgil photos that we discussed today.  You know we've told the stories of him before, and how he shows up at these conventions, and  he's never got a line, now Virgil is in a subway station in Grand Central here in New  York City, and he's just setting up a sign in a subway station, charging people for photos  with him.  Can I tell you, while we were doing the Virgil bit, I was honestly thinking, I'm like, you 
[03:24:30]  know, if he really does get wind of LonelyVirgil.net, and that thing starts blowing up, it's not  beneath him to try to seek you out and say you owe him money for using his name, and then  you have to tell him you don't own the Virgil name, Vince McMahon does.  Right.  So I don't owe you a dime.  I don't know.  Plus, I haven't made, there's no money to be made off of this.  It's just an exercise in humiliating you.  Well, just give me 20 bucks.  $20, boss.  $20.  $20.  You like Virgil, right?  You like Virgil.  Check it out.  $20.  Yeah, look, look, look.  Just $20, and you could post anything you want on that website. 
[03:25:00]  $5.  One of the descriptions of meeting him said that he charges about $30 for an autograph, but  you can usually talk him down to $5.  I don't know, because he loves to doublespeak when you're trying to do that.  He'll start saying $20, and then you're signing, and the whole whirlwind's going on.  All of a sudden, it's $40.  Right.  Because, yeah, as you're negotiating, the price goes down, and then it goes up real quick,  higher than it was before.  It's amazing.  It's amazing to see.  If you ever see Virgil, first of all, take a picture of him by himself and tweet it 
[03:25:30]  to me, and then go to negotiate with him.  Go haggle with him, just as an exercise.  The other thing, too, is at New York Comic Con, his table wasn't anywhere near where the  bigger, older wrestlers were, and over in that section was Tito Santana, Greg the Hammer  Valentine, and Brutus Beefcake.  Yeah, you had to pay to take your photos and get your stuff signed, but anytime there was  an interview, they dropped everything, and they would do the interview for TV.  Virgil won't do it.  Yeah, he charges for everything, and no one wants to talk to him.  No, except me, and I keep going up to him. 
[03:26:00]  Making money, boss.  You come back later.  I'm making money right now, boss.  I'm making money.  You're not making any money.  There's no one at your table.  I made a whole website about how you're not making any money.  You're not making money.  Well, you owe me $20 for that.  $20 for the website.  And the other thing is, I now know how small businesses feel.  I know how a mom-and-pop record company feels when Best Buy comes to town and just destroys  their store because Deadspin, which is a hilarious and massive sports blog, Deadspin, like months 
[03:26:30]  ago, maybe over the summer, started talking about Virgil.  And when Deadspin started talking about it, they go, ah, we found this great Lonely Virgil  website, and it's got all these pictures of Virgil, and he's so pathetic, and blah, blah,  blah.  And they write this whole thing, and they say it's based on the blog that I started.  Now, they've taken the concept and ran with it to the point that everybody associates  it with them.  They stopped crediting the original blog a long time ago. 
[03:27:00]  You don't see any more Lonely Virgil plugs on Deadspin anymore.  And they just go with it.  They go, yeah, send us all your Virgil stories.  Send us all your stories about wrestlers.  And we'll just post them.  Never mind the fact that we, what about me?  What about my little website that could?  Why don't you confront them then?  Because what am I going to do?  They're the machine.  They're the machine.  I'm just Sam Roberts.  All right, do we have another runner?  But for the record, nobody tell me that Deadspin is on top of this Virgil thing. 
[03:27:30]  I'm on top of it.  I can form Deadspin.  I'm a brilliant thinker.  I'm the one who thinks of these things, not Deadspin.  All right, let's hear the other runner-up.  This is the last runner-up.  Okay, last runner-up.  I came from boxing.  It would be tough for our fighters to make a transition to boxing.  I mean, I want to know who Dana was fighting when that happens.  It took a minute.  Let it sit with you.  Dana came from boxing. 
[03:28:00]  Oh.  Oh, very funny.  Very funny.  Let me go to Snowy in Michigan.  What's up, Snowy?  Hey, how you doing, Samuel?  Good.  Before I get through what I learned today, I've been meaning to tell you this.  Years ago, I met Virgil.  It was like, you know, probably late 90s or whatnot.  And I was real low on money, and I really couldn't.  I mean, I like meeting the older wrestlers.  I like meeting the older wrestlers.  Yeah.  They're walking through and shaking their hands.  Sure.  I'm surprised the fucker didn't charge me to shake his hand. 
[03:28:30]  He's just looking for a buck, dude.  Anything he could on me.  I was like, I really, you know, I don't, you know, I mean, I got a, George Animal Steel,  I got a photograph of him choking me.  It cost me seven bucks, and he didn't even charge an autograph as long as you had, like,  your own photograph.  You didn't charge.  I mean, he's.  There are guys you go to.  I swear, I've had interactions with people where I'm like, well, how much is it to take  a picture?  And they go, a picture's just a picture.  Come on, we'll take a photo.  Virgil is like, how much you got in your pocket?  How much you got on you?  Well, listen, Snowy, if you ever go back to any of these conventions and everybody out 
[03:29:00]  there, you got to take stealth photos of Virgil at the table by himself, and I'll put them  up on LonelyVirgil.net.  John in Colorado.  Sam Roberts, the greatest broadcaster ever.  Oh my gosh, thank you so much.  You know, this weekend, yesterday was just an outrage, a farce.  They came that piece of shit, Argo, you know, best director.  I mean, come on.  What about the great Sam Roberts producing? 
[03:29:30]  I mean, your greatest piece, the iPhone 5.  That's a good point.  I feel like, you know, waiting online for an iPhone 5 for no reason should have at least  been nominated for short, maybe even foreign short.  I don't know if it fits into that category, but she was obviously from another planet.  A short of some kind, I'm sure I could fit in there.  All right.  All right.  Enough delay.  Let's find out what won the O.P. and Anthony Show's line of the day.  Hit it. 
[03:30:00]  Here comes line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  It's like if you had light and you're bent.  Dr. Kaku, hi.  Oh God, don't hurt me.  Here are my testicles.  Oh, hey.  What's the...  Holla below.  Dr. Kaku in his testicles.  He does.  He gets so...  I love that bit.  He gets so nervous.  And it's funny because it's like O.P. says... 
[03:30:30]  Because they all...  You know Dr. Kaku.  He's the Asian guy who's the physicist.  He's been in here a bunch of times and he calls in.  He used to call in anyway.  He's all about string theory and dumbing down these theories.  O.P. lives near him.  And he's said that he's seen him so many times.  And now Dr. Kaku won't even acknowledge O.P. anymore.  Just because he's afraid of people.  We've only been nice to him on the show.  How come he hasn't been on in a while?  He...  I don't know.  We can't even get him on the phone anymore.  He won't answer the call.  And he won't return voicemails? 
[03:31:00]  Nope.  Emails nothing.  We have his info, but he...  No, it doesn't come on anymore.  I guess you've got to be out of your mind if you care that much.  Like you're that deep into physics and you shouldn't know how things work as well as he does.  Some things you just have to take for granted that they just exist as they are.  Let me go to Jason.  Jason in Detroit.  You're on after O.P. and Anthony live.  Hey, Sam.  I used to be an independent wrestler back in Detroit in the mid...  What was your name?  Just big Jason Fuller. 
[03:31:30]  That's why.  Yeah, that's why you didn't make it.  Because that's not a great...  That's a terrible name.  Oh, I'm sorry.  It should have been like, you know, William the Refrigerator Perry or something like that.  I could have done that, but it was already taken.  Oh.  Anyway, long story short, I was working a show with Virgil and actually the Bushwhackers.  And, uh...  Well, you know, I was still a fan at heart because that's why we get into it.  Of course.  And I got my phone to take with the Bushwhackers because I asked them in the back politely.  And they said, okay, no problem.  And you're working on a show with these guys, so you think they're like, oh, yeah, he's 
[03:32:00]  one of the boys, whatever.  Exactly.  I mean, I wasn't, you know, the main event, but I wasn't a curtain jerker either.  And I go up to Virgil and I, you know, politely ask him.  And he's like, oh, yeah, yeah, meet me at the table.  And I go to the table later and he's like trying to charge me, like, I'm one of the boys.  And he's like, yeah, but, uh, yeah, he goes, uh, five dollars.  I'm like, okay, whatever.  And I, you know, I've met other wrestlers and stuff like that. 
[03:32:30]  And he's the only guy in the history.  You're sitting there, you're looking at, you're looking at Virgil and you're saying, Virgil,  we're in the same business.  You know, I only make $15 to work on this show.  You're going to charge me to take a photo with you.  Five dollars, buddy.  Five dollars.  Five dollars.  Exactly.  I mean, I've met other guys.  I mean, I had a chance once to meet The Rock.  Greatest guy ever.  I mean, I was like a low nobody.  And at the time he was the Intercontinental champ a thousand times better.  It just proves to you the guys who have only had a taste to fight think they're a lot better 
[03:33:00]  than the guys who were truly great champions.  Yeah, dude.  All right.  Thanks a lot, buddy.  All right.  I would love to know if Virgil is aware of this.  Like, if he knows that the internet is talking about him.  And he's doing this on purpose.  Like, if he knew.  I need to know.  Now, did Virgil show up in that subway because he knew that people would take pictures and  it would get all over the internet?  Or is he legit like, I'm just, I'm in town.  I'm in New York.  Got to get that paper. 
[03:33:30]  Got to make that money.  Virgil knows where it's at.  Or was he coming back from a convention or somewhere and was in New York and ran out of  money?  So he had to start selling this stuff just to get train fare or bus fare to go back home  or to wherever he was going.  You think he literally was like one of those teenagers that's on the street in New York  with a cardboard sign that says, stuck in New York, stranded, need money for bus fare  back home.  Yeah, something along that.  Oh, that would be so funny if he came here for whatever reason and didn't raise enough 
[03:34:00]  money to get back home.  There's got to be some reason he's down there.  Maybe he's like in New York and he's looking at the bums that are begging and he's like,  damn, them's getting money.  I can't let them get all the money.  Virgil's got to get in on his action.  Virgil would make more money if he just put on sunglasses, sat down and had an open briefcase.  Yeah.  People would just think he's blind and throw money in rather than I'm not buying a photo  from Virgil.  Literally.  If Virgil were smart, if he is aware of this internet stuff and he's doing this subway thing 
[03:34:30]  on purpose, he's still an idiot.  Because if he were smart, he would just hold up a sign that said, somebody made a website  dedicated to the fact that nobody likes me.  I'm down on my luck.  Please give me some money.  And he would make tons of money.  Like if he just played the other route and he tried to get sympathy over the fact that  some asshole has created a website called lonelyvirgil.net and said, look, help me out.  I'm down on my luck.  People would give him cash. 
[03:35:00]  They'd just PayPal him money.  Yeah, Virgil.  I remember him, but no, it's got to be a hustle.  He's got to hustle the money.  And people don't have a lot of money.  It's not just Virgil.  The economy's tough.  You know, what do you spend your money on, E-Rock?  Lots of things.  What's one of the big things that just suck your money away that doesn't need to happen?  DVDs.  DVDs do that?  Sure.  DVDs do that.  Are you talking people in general or just me specifically?  You specifically.  Sometimes Lego sets can be pricey. 
[03:35:30]  Oh, Jesus, with the Lego sets.  There's just no reason for them.  They're over $100.  What Lego sets are you buying?  I haven't bought any in a while, but there's a new one coming out I'm definitely going to get.  They're releasing Ghostbusters.  I mean, I can't even solve that.  I'm going to get the Firehouse and Ecto-1.  Well, look, you know what?  We're not in the same tax bracket, so I don't have the problem of Legos being expensive  because I'm not even looking at them like that's something I can spend money on.  But you know what I do have a problem with that, like, my money is just disappearing? 
[03:36:00]  Bills.  Razorblades.  Wow.  Month after month.  I never thought of that.  I'm spending all this money on Razorblades.  Well, the problem is, Eric, that, like, you watch these commercials and you get convinced  that you need everything they're selling you.  And the point is you don't.  You don't need a vibrating handle on the Razor.  You don't need a back scratcher.  You don't need 10 blades to get a good shave.  They're screwing you.  How much are you paying for Razors?  $40, $50.  How much?  You got to buy them in the double packs. 
[03:36:30]  Is that in pesos?  No.  American dollars.  And we do this every month, Eric.  That's what I'm talking about.  For the rest of our lives as men, we do this every single month.  This, ladies and gentlemen, is your Dollar Shave Club moment.  Save the money.  Get yourself some Legos.  Don't spend it on Razorblades.  It's time for you to join all the after-Opie and Anthony Live listeners who've discovered  dollarshaveclub.com.

If you're in E-Rock's case, he was saying he spends $50 a month on Razors.  That's because he's got so much more area to cover that the blades go out quicker.  You'll never have that problem.  Dollar Shave Club is genius.  You'd be crazy not to do it.  You send them a couple bucks a month, and they deliver these amazing quality Razorblades  right to your door.

[03:38:00]  Dollarshaveclub.com.  That's dollarshaveclub.com.  I've been wasting my money.  Yeah.  You know how much more Legos you could be buying?  I know.  Now you could get Slimer, too.  It comes with it.  Of course it comes with it.  That was a dumb thing for me to bring up.  I would also like to say that I would like to thank Kevin Smith.  A great phone call on today's Opie and Anthony show, and I believe that he cleared my name.  There's no way.  Opie and Anthony earlier today.  I don't know if you watched the Oscars. 
[03:38:30]  I couldn't watch all of them because it's a very boring show.  And Kevin Smith was right about that.  I guess the guys didn't see the very beginning of the show.  Opie did, I think.  But Seth MacFarlane's William Shatner bit is 12 minutes long.  We could have had that done in four.  Yeah.  It was too long.  Why did they start at 8.30?  I've never heard of an award show.  They usually start at 8 o'clock.  On the hour, yeah.  To get the East Coast involved.  Well, what they do now, and I think they did this last year, too. 
[03:39:00]  They, I think they just got money to make in the red carpet coverage.  Well.  Because they're trying to extend, because what they do now.  First, last year, they did, they started at 8.30, but E's coverage ended at 8.  So you have to turn on ABC, and then they give you a half hour of their red carpet coverage.  This year, ABC blocked everybody out.  So, at 7.30, E had to stop covering.  And from 7.30 to 8.30, because you've got to see your red carpet pre-show, right? 
[03:39:30]  From 7.30 to 8.30, the only game in town was ABC.  They were doing that stupid mystery box.  Oh, yeah.  I could have sworn it was Gwyneth Paltrow's head.  What's in the box?  Yeah, two people said that, and they didn't know how to react to it.  No.  I mean, it's so stupid.  Yeah.  They were like, what do you think's in that box?  And they're just going, well, I don't know.  Like, I think I'm just going to go do another interview now.  What do you mean, what's in the box?  What difference does it make?  Is it an Oscar for me?  No?  All right. 
[03:40:00]  Well, I'm going to move on, then.  And I love, you know I love cruises, but Royal Caribbean really bought into.  Tom, his, oh, oh, go ahead.  No.  Royal Caribbean really bought into the red carpet and the Oscars.  Yeah.  And it was weird timing, too, because Kristen Chenoweth, who's a terrible host.  Yeah, she was on the red carpet.  And then I didn't see the ending of the Oscars, but I was looking up online.  She did a number or something with Seth at the end.  Yeah, she did a song at the end.  It was The Losers.  I think I have it.  And I don't think she would have been involved with this at all had Royal Caribbean not bought 
[03:40:30]  into this whole award thing so heavily that made her the godmother of a new cruise ship.  What is a godmother of a cruise ship?  Is she going to be on a cruise ship?  It's a title that they usually give to, like, political leaders, where they, when they're  ready to christen the ship on its maiden voyage, they smash the ship with a bottle of champagne.  Like ambassadeurs?  Something like that.  But it's always political figures that do this.  This is the first time they're having some dippy celebrity.  Here's a taste of the number that Seth MacFarlane and Kristen Chenoweth did last night at the 
[03:41:00]  end of the show.  All right.  You know, there were a lot of winners here tonight.  And this was like 1130 at night.  Everybody was fed up with it.  Disappointed and upset.  1130?  Yeah.  We want to kind of cheer you up.  We're saying after 12.  Maybe it was.  We want to go to the red carpet show.  And now she's going to close with me because you're all sick to death of this guy.  The lovely Kristen Chenoweth.  How are you?  Good.  And we just want to say, here's to the losers.  Yes, the losers. 
[03:41:30]  Argo.  Argo, man.  Come on.  Argo.  We love that Argo.  We do.  We do.  We put it in a long opening.  It's a long opening.  Here's to all the losing works of art from Lincoln to Amore.  To the disappointed actors wondering what they dressed up for.  Now the real performance starts with phony smiles at the ball.  I wonder if Seth MacFarlane resents having like a good comic mind. 
[03:42:00]  Because he obviously just wants to sing and dance.  And he's not bad at it.  No, this is all he wants to do.  And he's good at it.  But yeah, Kristen Chenoweth, she became famous on Broadway.  Yeah, but there was no reason for her to be involved with this whatsoever.  Right.  They've been trying to work her into TV for a little while now.  And I mean, I guess she could be a movie star.  But she's just not a good host.  She was terrible interviewing people on the red carpet.  She looked very strange.  She's very intense.  She always has like a vein in her forehead ready to burst. 
[03:42:30]  And then, yeah.  And then she came out at the end and did this.  Obviously, yeah.  I think Royal Caribbean was deeply in bed with this.  Because every commercial break, Kristen Chenoweth would pop up again saying,  I'm the godmother of the Royal Caribbean, blah, blah, blah.  But the only thing, it's way too soon.  The only thing anybody thinks about is, oh, the shit cruise.  I don't get it.  Oh, with all the toilets overflowing.  There's no reason to have her be involved with the cruise thing.  You know what I learned?  And this is something I wanted to bring up on the show when we first talked about that cruise ship 
[03:43:00]  that went to Mobile, Alabama.  Yeah.  If you want to get E-Rock to confident, like, you know how Opie and Anthony, they always say,  where's confident E-Rock?  We hear confident E-Rock on the after show.  We don't hear him on our show.  If you want to get confident E-Rock and you want to get him to be wordy and talking a lot,  you bring up cruises for any reason.  And you have an opinion.  You have a strong opinion.  You don't need a celebrity endorsement.  Is that right on your cruises?  No, but if you're going to use a celebrity for the first time to do this, 
[03:43:30]  there's such a higher caliber of celebrity you could have gotten to do this.  Well, do you think that they're in panic mode now?  Like, I don't understand.  Why wait two weeks after the big shit cruise story to get your name?  Like, wouldn't it be smarter if right now they just tried to lay low for a little bit?  Yeah, but because of Carnival's big fuck-up, the whole industry gets looked at as,  like, I'm never taking a cruise, doesn't matter what cruise line.  And you don't like that.  So, Royal Caribbean, no, if anything, I want to go on one now. 
[03:44:00]  Because most people don't want to go on it and it'll be a lot cheaper to go.  Plus, you want to save the cruise industry.  Yes.  I mean, you're a guy who, you endorse the cruise industry in a big, big way.  I do.  Troy is going on a Royal Caribbean cruise, like, next week.  I heard.  Good for him.  It's insane.  It is.  Although, I talked to him, I was hanging out with him over the weekend,  and I talked to his girlfriend, and she's right, she's obviously an optimist.  She said, I think that because we're going now, they'll have all their shit together.  Well, Royal Caribbean always did have all their shit together. 
[03:44:30]  No, they didn't.  Remember, it was all their shit all over the boat.  No, that was Carnival.  Oh, that was Carnival.  Are you doing Carnival?  Yeah, I'm doing Carnival.  I leave.  My cruise is this Thursday.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  It's supposed to get stuck.  Now, you're, but you're, I talked to your girlfriend over the weekend.  Yeah.  Optimistic.  Saying that you guys feel that since this bullshit already happened,  they'll have all their ships ready to fucking go.  Yeah.  They're going to be on top of their game.  Now, are you worried about partying this ship into the ground?  No.  You're not?  No.  Carnival's the party, the cruise line. 
[03:45:00]  Oh, I think we have our guests coming in.  Carnival's a party, though?  Yeah.  Obviously.  It's going to be fun.  It could be a shit party, though.  Possibly.  I'll talk to you about it tomorrow.  Hi.  We're on the air right now, Wendy.  Come on in.  How you doing?  Good.  How are you?  Welcome.  Well, I'm going to, because you're here.  Yes, yes.  Yes, you may should sit there.  Nice to see you.  Wendy, now, tell me your name.  Is your name hyphenated or not?  It is hyphenated.  Okay, so you tell me your name.  McClendon.  McClendon Covey.  Okay.  Because I was told I was going to interview Wendy McClendon, and I don't want to come in. 
[03:45:30]  You know, I answer to both.  Oh, because I don't want to.  I'm not difficult.  I'm not trying to insult you right off the bat.  It's totally fine.  You all know Wendy.  She was in Bridesmaids, and Reno 911, and all these great, you've been.  All kinds of fun things.  You started as an improv comic, right?  I did.  I did.  Did I read correct that you and Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig were all improv-ing together  at the same time?  Kind of same class?  We were all at the Groundlings at the same time. 
[03:46:00]  We weren't together, necessarily, at first, because Melissa was already established.  Oh, she was?  On Gilmore Girls and stuff, but Kristen and I were both struggling and starving.  So we all met at a wedding shower, oddly enough.  But yeah, we were all there at the same time.  And then, so you've kind of all gone up and down at the same time.  But you, Reno 911 was kind of before, especially Kristen, had anything major, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:46:30]  So were they like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa?  How did you get this?  I don't have anything like that.  I don't know.  Maybe they did say that.  That's how I would be.  Maybe they did say that.  I don't know.  But I got Reno right as I was about to throw in the towel and just stop everything.  You were about to leave the business?  Yeah.  How come?  Because I wasn't getting anywhere.  Uh-huh.  And, you know, at the Groundlings, it is very competitive, but everybody was always going  on auditions and all these things.  And I had really crappy representation. 
[03:47:00]  And it was like, okay, maybe I'm too old to do this.  Maybe I started too late.  When did you start?  I started at the Groundlings late in my 20s.  Okay.  So by the time I finished, I was 32 or whatever.  And I just thought, you know what?  I'm not getting anywhere.  Time to stop this.  Is that the goal?  When you go someplace like the Groundlings or whatever to study improv, is the goal to  be a comic actress?  Because when you do stand-up, the goal is kind of just like, even if you don't act, you 
[03:47:30]  could still be a stand-up.  But are there people who can just be improv people without having that vehicle?  Maybe that's how it is for someone, but that's not how it was for me.  The Groundlings is sketch writing and performing and character development.  And I just stayed there because I just kept getting moved up.  But I took acting classes other places.  And I just wanted to be in the business.  I didn't want to necessarily be on Whose Line Is It Anyway? 
[03:48:00]  Right, right, right, right.  So did you see Kristen Wiig?  Because Kristen Wiig's first break is one of my favorite shows of all time.  Besides Reno 911, of course.  You don't have to say that.  You don't have to say that.  Which is the Joe Schmo show.  Oh, wasn't that great?  Did you watch it?  Yes.  The first season...  Wasn't that a trip?  The first season was...  The second season was kind of a disaster.  Yeah.  But the first season was one of the best seasons of television.  Yeah, yeah.  Do you think you could hang in a situation like that? 
[03:48:30]  Um, I would have a really tough time.  I would have a really tough time because I get too emotional.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, I...  That was one of the most interesting sociological experiments I've ever seen.  Yeah.  And that reveal was insane.  The guy was perfect because he was, I think his name, Matt Kennedy Gould was his name.  Wow.  I swear, I have it on DVD.  I've watched it over and over again.  And whatever became of him?  Nothing.  I think he went back to being a pizza guy. 
[03:49:00]  I mean, nothing.  Wow.  Because he was as dumb as a brick.  He was a little thick, yeah.  But he was like this sweet...  He was sweet.  And his true colors came out and he was still sweet.  Yeah.  What I liked about that show was that they made it so, uh, at the end they were like,  this is all for you.  Instead of saying, we've been laughing at you this whole time.  Right.  Like, instead of actually telling them, no, the whole thing's a joke on you.  Yeah.  We've been laughing at you for weeks now.  Yeah.  We've got TV monitors everywhere. 
[03:49:30]  They were like, we did this for you.  It's like a gift.  Yes.  And he was like, oh.  Oh, okay.  So it's a good thing.  Yeah.  It's a good thing.  Don't worry about it.  Oh, I forgot about that show.  Yeah.  No, never forget about that show.  No, never forget.  Like, every time somebody new comes into my life, a friend or whoever, I'm like, have  you seen this show?  Let's put the DVDs on and we're watching it.  That's a good litmus test if they respond properly to the show.  Yeah.  And if they're like, this show sucks, you're out of my life.  So do you.  Forever.  You suck.  Get out of here.  Goodbye.  So what are you doing now?  It's a Masters of Sex? 
[03:50:00]  Masters of Sex.  On Showtime.  Yeah, on Showtime.  What is this show?  A nice little recurring on that.  Yeah.  And it doesn't debut until September, but just wait.  It's going to be pretty awesome.  You know the Masters and Johnson's, Masters and Johnson's sex researchers?  I guess so.  In the 50s.  Yeah.  And these are the guys who kind of started.  They kind of took the shame out of sex.  Okay.  And let people know, hey, you're supposed to enjoy this.  Yeah.  They kind of picked up where Kinsey left off and really examined things, like filmed people  having sex and really studied the biological. 
[03:50:30]  Before it was just porn.  Before it was just, all right, you know where you're supposed to put that, right?  Yeah.  That's what we're doing.  This was more like, you know, you're supposed to enjoy this and both partners are supposed to  enjoy it.  Right.  I play a doctor with an agenda, with a secret.  Oh my gosh.  What is it?  I can't tell you.  Oh.  Oh.  I can't.  It's a secret.  Don't you understand?  Of course.  Why would anybody watch if the secret was exposed?  So that, I have a nice little recurring on rules of engagement. 
[03:51:00]  As Liz, the crazy cat lady who accidentally married David Spade's character.  Uh-huh.  So that's been quite a gift.  So you've, so it seemed like, so you're, you're ready to quit the business.  Uh-huh.  You get Reno 911.  Uh-huh.  And then it seems like you've pretty much, you've been pretty steady since then.  I've been working pretty steadily.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you, is it true?  Now, was anyone paying attention?  No, but I have been working very steadily.  Yeah.  You were just like, oh, I know her.  That's a, yeah. 
[03:51:30]  She crops up every now and again.  You play very, your roles that you play are very, uh, sexually heightened.  Did you know you were on-  Not all of them.  Not all of them.  Do you know you're on Maxim's-  Yeah, yeah.  Top 10 nymphos on television?  Yes.  Because of, because of, of Reno.  Yeah.  You don't seem proud of that.  I, you know, I never saw that article, but people started telling me that.  And believe me, I'm sure it was just like, not even a quarter page little chart that  they needed to just fill space. 
[03:52:00]  So whatever, it is what it is.  But now sometimes people like to react to me personally as though I am a nympho.  Right.  Well, you're on the list.  So you got, and you're like, no.  I'm not.  I'm totally frigid.  You are.  You're frigid.  I haven't lost, I've been married 16 years.  I'm not going to lose my virginity until our 20 year anniversary.  You haven't even consummated it yet.  No.  Uh-uh.  So you couldn't be less like these characters.  I couldn't be less.  It's just acting.  Yeah.  You guys, it's acting.  And plus Mona from Who's the Boss is also on the list.  Oh, she is?  Yeah.  Well, see, now that's appropriate. 
[03:52:30]  Right.  That seems very appropriate.  Although it makes you look better.  Does it?  I think so.  I mean, Mona's like an old lady.  Like, it makes you like, okay.  But I'm number 10.  I think I'm the last.  That's fine.  I'll take it.  Unless maybe it's reverse type of thing.  Well, maybe.  I don't know for sure.  Is it true?  Look at you trying to make me feel better about this whole thing.  I want you to feel good and feel comfortable and feel like this was a good idea.  Is it true?  Because people don't do that to you always.  I read that you got fired from Reno 911 by email.  Is that true?  Yes.  What type of stuff? 
[03:53:00]  What is that?  You were on the show for how long?  Five seasons, right?  Five seasons.  Five seasons.  And then it.  That's so funny that you bring that up.  Because you're not even supposed to cancel on plans with somebody by email.  Like, if you're not going to dinner with somebody, you call them.  And yet I do.  I'm very passive aggressive.  You've been conditioned, though.  And I hate to talk on the phone.  You do.  So it's all fine.  I'm friends with everybody.  I did a thing with Tom.  It's not fine with me.  Tom Lennon and I played husband and wife in, what was that blockbuster movie? 
[03:53:30]  What to Expect When You're Expecting.  That's true.  And Ben and I played lovers on Bob's Burgers.  So, you know.  It's all fine.  Look, it sucked.  At the time, it sucked.  Okay?  Because I had just been fired off a movie.  A movie?  Because one of the money guys thought I was ugly.  I'm not even going to mention it because you know what?  It never came out.  Good.  How about that?  Yeah, that means that people that they hired must have been even uglier.  They were, um, uh, well, they couldn't act. 
[03:54:00]  Right.  Did they tell you, we're firing you because you're ugly?  Uh, it came back to me.  Ugh.  It came back to me.  That's terrible news.  But you know what?  It was horrible.  I cried all the way home from humiliation.  But when I got home, they said, they want you on The Office tomorrow.  And you were like, oh.  Well, guess what?  I got to be on The Office, which everybody saw.  Nobody saw this stupid movie.  Didn't even get made.  Because it hasn't been, it hasn't been released.  It will never be released.  It was terrible.  It was one of those things where I was spared.  Yeah.  I would have had to stay in Michigan for five weeks. 
[03:54:30]  Michigan?  Um, making a movie that sucked.  My parents are from Michigan and we've gone up there.  It's not a great place to visit.  I mean, you spend a week there, okay, but you don't want to spend months there working.  I don't want to spend a month with a bunch of people who are openly hostile.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they obviously don't respect-  Making a crappy movie.  The art form of acting.  And so then, and also, the Reno thing worked out for the better too.  Because let's be honest, after season five, the show had kind of run its course. 
[03:55:00]  It kind of had.  You know?  We were lucky it went on that long.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know?  And you had five good seasons and then you had people being like-  We had-  Yeah.  We had three good seasons.  Three.  They had three.  Quite honestly.  But it's all good.  It's all good.  Everything works out the way it's supposed to.  It sucked at the time.  I will say that.  But it was the best.  It was for the best.  When you end up doing Bridesmaids, is that because of your connections with Kristen and Melissa?  Or is that just it happened and now we're all together again? 
[03:55:30]  We all had to audition.  Yeah.  You know?  My part was, they said they wrote it with me in mind and, you know, they keep saying that  so I have to take that at face value that they did.  But I had to audition.  Yeah.  You were like, well, you wrote it for me in mind.  Melissa was originally something else entirely because Annie Mumolo was going to play that  part.  I mean, so we all had to audition and people, everybody wanted to do this film.  So every time I would go in, there would be more famous people there and it would be  like, well, at least I made it this far. 
[03:56:00]  So when I got it, I was thrilled.  So you guys knew, did you kind of have an idea of how massive this thing would be?  No.  You just knew it was good?  We just knew we were having fun with it.  Right.  We had no idea.  You just knew it was funny.  Yeah.  And so you're like, yeah, we got to get on board with this.  Yeah.  Do you ever know when something's going to be successful?  No.  You don't.  Do you know?  Never.  But sometimes you know when it's not going to be successful.  Um, yeah.  Yeah.  Have you ever been part of something that like halfway through you're going, I should  have said no to this? 
[03:56:30]  Uh-huh.  Plenty of times.  What was it?  I'm not saying.  Why not?  Just, you know, don't you try to trick me.  Just say like a quick thing.  Why don't you trick me?  We'll just do one thing.  Okay.  All right.  No.  We won't say anything.  I can't.  I Google searched you and you know what comes up after your name, like under related searches?  The word feet.  Do people have a thing for your feet?  I didn't think so.  You gotta be.  You know what?  My feet are devastating.  Are they great?  They're pretty good.  Yeah.  Obviously.  Because you should. 
[03:57:00]  They're pretty good.  You know, does it have, um, pictures of me barefoot at the Oscars last year?  Because I couldn't get my shoes back on?  Was that what it was?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Because I don't know.  I didn't click the feet thing.  I didn't know my feet was that interesting.  I'm not like a foot fetish guy, personally.  When really, it's my, it's kind of my elbows that I thought were my best feature.  You're an elbow girl.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look at these.  Always trying to highlight those.  Keep moisturizing them and stuff.  Keep moisturizing them.  Yeah.  Just walking around.  Yeah.  Just like, hey.  There are guys out there with elbow fetishes, so I would be careful if I were you. 
[03:57:30]  Did you watch?  So you were at the Oscars last year?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  We presented.  Did you watch them last night?  I watched some of, I fell asleep during part of it.  Yeah.  I don't know anybody who watched the entire broadcast.  Why can't that show be three more hours longer, you guys?  Seriously, there's no reason for the Oscars to go on for more than two hours.  Because.  Yeah.  All anybody wants to see is who won. 
[03:58:00]  Right.  And there's maybe.  Cut the bits.  There's maybe six categories that people talk about.  Yeah.  Like, if we're not looking at who won at the, why put it on television?  Why put it on television?  And I mean.  Why do we keep retreading these?  I don't know.  Seth MacFarlane's like, no, no, no.  This is an opportunity for me to sing and dance a lot.  A lot.  Now look, I thought he was funny.  Yeah.  I thought he did a good job.  But did that William Shatner thing have to go on for 12 minutes?  Did it have to go on for 20 minutes?  And at the end of 20 minutes, Shatner goes, go on, start the show. 
[03:58:30]  And I was like, what?  We haven't started?  It's nine o'clock at night.  What?  I gotta be up tomorrow morning.  Come on.  Yeah.  I mean, just get dressed up.  Look pretty.  Mm-hmm.  Give out the awards and let's go home.  Yeah, yeah.  And the red carpet coverage starts at, what, two?  Yeah.  It's too much.  Oh, my God.  It's too much.  I do a show on Sundays from four to six.  And my mother-in-law is having me and my wife over at her house for the awards. 
[03:59:00]  And I'm like, okay, I'll just do the show.  And then we'll be at your house by seven, plenty of time.  And my wife goes, no, because we're going to watch red carpet.  So I'm not going to come in.  I'm going to go to my mom's house.  And I'm sitting there like, we literally left before a statue had been handed out.  Because we've seen three hours of people walking down a red carpet.  It's too much.  And one of the people, you were there last year.  Yes.  The people who get there at like five o'clock or three hours before it starts, whatever  that is, West Coast time, and start doing these interviews on the red carpet. 
[03:59:30]  What do you do until the show starts?  Okay, do you know that it takes at least two hours to go down that carpet?  Two hours?  I'm not kidding.  Where does all this footage go?  It's worldwide.  I mean, you end up talking to like Philippine extra, you know?  You talk to everybody.  And it takes forever.  So yes, then once you get in, and you're already tired, you've still got, you know,  10 hours to go for the evening. 
[04:00:00]  Yeah, they have food and booze and whatever.  Once you can get past this onslaught.  But yeah, once you can get past that.  But, you know, you start getting ready.  People were telling me like, oh, your makeup guy's going to get there at 10 a.m.  10 a.m.?  Yeah.  I'm going to look like a melted wax figure by the time the show starts.  And it's so weird to see people like the Charlize Theron's and the Clooney's and the people  that are there for every single award show every year.  Because you're like, this is planning, this is like prom or planning a wedding every day. 
[04:00:30]  We went to every award show last year.  Okay.  The first two months of the year were just spent getting dressed and going to shows.  And I was so exhausted by the end.  You're like, I don't want to do hit movies anymore.  No more hairspray.  No more hairspray.  I don't want to.  Please.  I'm tired of people touching me.  Let me go.  Yeah.  Let me go back to when I was just that girl from something.  Yeah.  I don't want this.  Remember when I used to work?  Yeah.  I need to make a living.  Yeah.  We've done nothing. 
[04:01:00]  Is there.  The first two months.  Yeah.  Do you get.  Is there any money involved in doing all this press?  Oh, no.  So when you're on these press tours, you're just like, hopefully I made enough money on that  other.  It's part of the deal.  Yeah.  You.  When you sign your contract to do something, it's part of the deal.  You got to do press.  Which I love.  Of course.  I truly love it.  I have a good time with it.  We're having a great time right now.  I could be having a better time.  I'm not doing a great job.  I'm kidding.  No.  I'm having a great time.  No.  I love it.  But yeah.  It's like, well, I hope there's something waiting for me when I get back because grandma 
[04:01:30]  has to make some money.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you see Melissa presenting last night?  Mm-hmm.  It seemed like the audience thought it was weird.  They didn't seem like they really knew.  Once again, those little bits.  Yeah.  No one cares.  Yeah.  Nobody cares.  And when it goes on for longer than 20 seconds, everybody's just looking at their watches  like, this show's never going to end.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So when you, do you feel for her up there going like, it's not her fault.  She's got to get off this stage. 
[04:02:00]  Well, I remember last year they, they, they had a bit where all five of us came out and  there were some funny words exchanged and then, you know, blah, blah, blah.  We each in sets of two would come out and hand out an award and people were part of our  little group was like, this isn't funny.  We need to punch it up and make it funnier.  And Ellie Kemper and I were just saying, just say it, just say it and say it quickly.  Like no one's, I, this isn't about you. 
[04:02:30]  Yeah.  This isn't about you.  It doesn't matter how you punch this up.  No one cares because we come out at hour two and a half.  Yeah.  And the longer you go, the angrier people are going to be tomorrow.  And we're going to be having, we're going to be part of conversations like you and I  are having right now going like, did they have to go on?  You can't win with that.  You absolutely can't win.  Yeah.  And it screws everybody up who, who has to accept their award at the end of the night.  Well, that's what.  No one's as happy for them.  You're watching.  They're hungry and they want to go home.  You're watching guys accept awards that are never going to be on that stage again. 
[04:03:00]  And the Jaws music is playing to get them off stage.  That was insane.  And you're going, like I'd be, if I were accepting an award, if somebody was going to  somebody would give me an award for something and I were there, I'd be like, did Seth really  have to do 12 minutes?  I can't have an extra 20 seconds.  Yeah.  We, I had to sit through that tap dance and you can't wait for me to thank my attorney.  Yeah.  He did a lot for me and he gets 10% of this.  Exactly.  15 maybe.  Exactly.  Wow.  And, and, and you're also doing a Tyler Perry movie. 
[04:03:30]  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Single mom's club.  Is he in the movie as Medea?  He is in the movie as a man.  What?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So there is a good cast, Terry Crews and.  Oh, he's hilarious.  He's been in here before.  He's, he's hilarious.  Yeah.  And very handsome.  What I like about Terry Crews is like people are finding out he's funny now, but like you  go, like you watch like training day and movies from like, you know, eight to 10 years  ago and he's just playing random gangster in all these movies before anybody realized that  he could talk and be funny. 
[04:04:00]  Yeah.  I mean, on everybody hates Chris.  I thought this guy is so lovable and so real.  He's just great.  I liked it.  It was funny on everybody hates Chris though that they had to keep him in that jumpsuit  all the time.  So you couldn't tell that he just looked like a bodybuilder.  You couldn't tell that he's got muscles popping out of his muscles.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  He has things popping out of his muscles that I've never seen on a.  Is Tyler Perry.  Is he very controlling on his set?  Cause you know, he's so branded on everything that it makes me think that he's writing, he's 
[04:04:30]  directing, he knows what it should be.  And you know, this is.  But when he hires you.  Yeah.  He has total faith that you're bringing something that no one else can bring.  So he's very collaborative.  If you have a funnier way to say something, go ahead and do it.  Right.  He's like, I have confidence enough in my decision to hire you.  Yeah.  Now it's in your hands a little bit.  Yeah.  He's a machine.  He's a machine.  He's got what?  Five shows on the air now?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's pretty amazing.  And does a movie every six months.  So I guess that's a good person to be associated with. 
[04:05:00]  Yeah.  Are you hoping?  And he was very sweet.  I have to say he was.  He doesn't have a big Oprah ego about him?  No.  Like he's not master of the world?  I didn't feel that way.  Good.  I didn't feel that way.  I thought he was very, very sweet.  Have you ever been on Oprah?  Have you ever met Oprah?  No, I have not met the Oprah.  I would imagine that she has an ego about her.  I mean, when she comes up here.  She's been up here once in like four years.  They shut the place down.  The whole lobby.  Like we work here.  Can't go in the lobby of the building.  Because what?  Will crazy middle-aged women try to like break the doors down? 
[04:05:30]  I don't know.  You think they wouldn't.  That's what it is.  You'd think everybody who was hired to work here could maintain that, but maybe not.  But the rabid fans from the street.  Just running up?  Is that what it is?  No, I mean the lobby of this floor.  Of this floor?  Oh!  Oh, that's weird.  We can't even go down the hall.  Well, I think you're all trustworthy.  Thank you.  That seems very stupid to me.  Well, Wendy, I'm glad you're here.  Are you on Twitter?  I am on Twitter.  What's your Twitter?  Wendy McClendon Co. 
[04:06:00]  C-O?  C-O.  Okay.  Wendy McClendon Co.  On Twitter.  And then people can...  The Tyler Perry movie will be out.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Look on my IMDb.  And all that stuff is coming.  Which is such a rashy thing to say, but I don't have a website or anything.  I'm not that...  So that's what you're here to promote.  You've got a whole bunch of shit coming out.  A whole bunch of stuff coming out.  So be on the lookout for me.  Modern Family.  Oh, my God.  Rules of Engagement.  A movie with Rashida Jones called Cuban Fury. 
[04:06:30]  Claire's Cambodia.  I got like...  Do you play the Cuban?  I play the Cuban.  Congratulations.  And I'm furious.  Congratulations.  Some of my best work.  Thanks.  Well, thank you for stopping by, and we will see you all tomorrow.  Goodbye, everybody.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time. </pre>
