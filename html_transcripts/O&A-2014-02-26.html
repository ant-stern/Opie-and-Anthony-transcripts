<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts grappling with technical difficulties, specifically problems with their headphones, followed by comedic complaints about their seemingly indifferent employers, regardless of the show's success.  This led to a discussion about a New Orleans man who survived a gunshot wound to the head, prompting speculation about his possible political connections and precarious situation.  The conversation then took a bizarre turn, evolving into an extended, absurd brainstorming session with callers on how to execute the perfect crime, focusing on creative (though flawed) methods of evading surveillance and disguises.

Next, the hosts predicted a tense rivalry between returning morning radio host Scott Shannon and his former co-host, Todd, criticizing Todd's song parodies and overall show quality.  A caller, Dave, a former criminal, recounted his past robberies and his eventual capture due to an incident involving a bread truck, detailing life after prison.  The show then heavily promoted the upcoming appearance of Ted Lange ("The Love Boat"), with humorous mispronunciations of his name and on-air research into his career, including details about his interactions with various celebrities like Ginger Rogers and Gene Kelly, and even salacious gossip about Lonnie Anderson and Burt Reynolds, along with vulgar speculation about Zsa Zsa Gabor's health and Ava Gabor's alleged racism.  There was also speculation about a possible Sammy Davis Jr. appearance on *The Love Boat* and a humorous anecdote about Aaron Spelling removing Davis Jr.'s glass eye. Further criticism of Todd’s radio show followed, with clips of poorly received song parodies and awkward prank calls being played. This section also included a listener's trivia about Debbie Harry and Ted Bundy (later debunked), a caller's commentary on the show's target audience, a discussion of a prank call seemingly reusing an actress, and several 911 calls, one involving a woman attempting to seduce a responding officer.  The segment concluded with the news of a California couple finding $10 million in gold coins.

The discussion of the gold-finding couple and their plans to sell the coins on Amazon, including tax implications and a potential lawsuit, segued into further attempts to contact Ted Lange for an interview.  Efforts to reach Paul Williams to get a question for Lange were unsuccessful.  The conversation veered off to Elijah Wood's upcoming appearance, a digression about Bill Devane's perceived wealth, and then Elijah Wood arrived in studio.  Wood discussed his views on flu shots, a humorous encounter with Deepak Chopra, and his recent roles, including *Grand Piano* and *Cooties*. He also described the challenges of learning piano for *Grand Piano*, including the use of a hand double.  A caller mistakenly believed Wood was involved in a publicity stunt featuring a repeatedly worn outfit.  This segment also included a recurring "Stalker Patty" segment featuring a naked woman searching for a check amongst mousetraps. The segment concluded with promotion for *Grand Piano* and a sexually explicit call.

The next segment began with a discussion about Cowhead, a listener with an unusual name, including crude jokes about sexual acts with cows.  The conversation then returned to the upcoming Ted Lange interview, mentioning Cowhead's connection to a new sponsor, WWE, and reminiscing about WrestleMania. Cowhead’s band, "Pitbull Toddler," was also mentioned. The hosts then reminisced about a childhood friend, Stanley, a bodybuilder, before expressing dissatisfaction with the support for their show and movie ideas, interspersed with crude and sexually suggestive remarks about songs. Ted Lange finally arrived, and a lengthy interview ensued. Lange recounted his experiences on *The Dating Game*, a trip to Ireland with a contestant and an inattentive chaperone, and his time on *The Love Boat*, discussing its popularity, interactions with celebrities like Sonny Bono and Gene Kelly, production anecdotes, and the financial aspects of his career, including payments for reruns. He shared stories about securing a Hong Kong suite during filming and humorous interactions with cast members, touching on the luxurious catering and the presence of passengers during filming.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Oh boy.  Good morning.  Hi.  I can't hear out of one of the headphones.  What, you got one here?  Well, now it's working.  Oh.  Maybe the pot's dirty.  Sometimes you gotta go back and forth a lot with the pot.  Trying to complain less, but that's one thing that will drive radio guys nuts.  When their headphones aren't working properly. 
[00:00:30]  Can't have one.  I can't do radio with just one headphone.  I don't know how you guys do two.  I feel totally like I'm underwater when I have both headphones on.  Really?  Yeah, I hate the way Voss does it because he looks retarded.  Voss? Yeah.  I always have one behind my ear and one on my ear.  Yeah.  I never have two on my ears.  I feel like I'm...  Oh, jeez.  It feels weird to have two on like this.  Does it?  I don't like it.  I like it a lot.  It's like, you know, you talk underwater.  When you...  It just feels like you're underwater hearing something. 
[00:01:00]  I feel too surrounded by it.  Oh.  Well, I fixed it just in time.  I was just panicking for the last two minutes.  That'll drive any radio guy nuts.  Yeah, you can't have that one.  Remember when they used to like change out the headphones and it would mess us up for like...  Yeah.  Not just a day, like a few days.  It'd sound all different.  And every headphone sounds different, even if it's from the same company.  That's always been strange to me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You would think it would be exactly the same if you're buying Sony's or whatever. 
[00:01:30]  Exactly.  But, all right, we're here and everything's fine.  Sorry about that.  Yeah, now it's working.  Yeah.  Dirty pots.  Dirty pots.  Yeah, you gotta twist those dials.  We live in an analog world here still.  Very analog here.  Yeah, just let everyone else pass us by.  No problem.  Right, with all your fun digital stuff.  We'll just sit here with knobs.  Satellite dials.  I believe satellite had like a 10-year, you know, lead on everyone.  Yeah.  You don't think they've made the most of it? 
[00:02:00]  Oh, God, no.  And then...  Hey, they're doing well as a company, but...  Fuck, man.  Come on, let's go.  Step it up.  Step it up.  We're challenging you.  Are we?  Yeah, sure.  Do they even listen to the show?  I don't know.  It's the weirdest fucking gig I've ever had in my life.  They don't care if we do well, and they don't care if we do bad.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  Preaching to the converted, as they say.  At least we got the listeners that are fucking on our ass constantly.  Yes.  Just constantly on our ass. 
[00:02:30]  That last minute of the radio show sucked.  I just want to let you know, you guys are doing good right up until the last minute.  The show is really good, but...  Oh, boy.  Do people enjoy a good butt?  A good butt.  When they're complaining.  Not complaining.  When they're praising you.  Yeah.  Why does everything have to have the butt?  Why can't it be...  The show is really good today.  Not the show is really good today, but... 
[00:03:00]  Why do you have to insert something here?  Right, right, right.  Yeah.  That's great.  I don't understand it.  I don't get it.  I don't get it.  What do you guys want to start with?  Oh, man.  There's a lot going on today.  Yeah, there's stuff going on.  I'm obsessed with this guy, and, Ope, you told me that this was this guy who got shot in  the head and lived in New Orleans. 
[00:03:30]  That's pretty amazing.  Leave me out of it.  I don't know what it is.  It's a guy who's...  There's a...  It's called the Ohica Castle?  Yeah, that's right in my neighborhood.  Where I...  It's in Huntington, right?  That's what I thought of you.  Moralize, yeah.  On the outskirts.  I grew up very close to there, yeah.  And he had a hitman fucking popped him in the head.  It was like an old school guy.  He had a ski mask on and came around and popped him in the head to his Mercedes.  And he...  The bullet...  I guess this guy's a big, thick skull and a fucking bullet didn't pierce his head.  Right.  And he's alive.  He was chatting. 
[00:04:00]  Chatting.  In the hospital the other day?  And now he's worried that they're going to come back to finish the job.  Yeah.  Yeah, I...  That's fucked up.  Look, all right.  You think it's some...  It might be some, you know...  It might be some enemies that he has.  Yeah, I don't...  Let's name names.  No.  He's been affiliated with some politicians and stuff like that.  That he's given a lot of money to some political causes and stuff that prevented some people  from zoning things.  So there's like that angle, too. 
[00:04:30]  I don't go down that road.  No, man.  Those guys don't play.  The old dirt road.  Those guys don't play, man.  Nah.  I might have worked to, you know...  Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, uh...  Not directly in that world, but on the outskirts of that world.  Might have carried their bags.  And I know that they don't play.  That's all I'll say.  With their shiny shoes.  Fuck.  Yeah.  But as an assassin, it's got to bum you out that there's security cameras everywhere.  Oh, yeah.  Because they said they caught the thing on... 
[00:05:00]  They caught a parking lot surveillance camera, captured the shoot.  Yeah.  Like, you can't get away with anything anymore because of surveillance cameras.  It should be bombed.  It's all just right there, yeah.  No, but I'm thinking, like, no matter where you are, there's a camera somewhere that's  going to get you doing something.  If it's not doing the shooting, it's going to be driving away or a traffic light camera.  They look everywhere now.  When there's a crime, they have people that just, all right, find every fucking camera  in the area and check it. 
[00:05:30]  I was imagining one day, if I did some horrific crime, could I, like, go into the subway?  This is my escape plan.  Oh, nice.  So I got my clothes on, right?  I hope so.  And let's say I have a backpack with other clothes.  So I'm like, okay, I did my horrific crime.  Now I'm going to dip into the subways.  But the cameras already got me.  They got you.  But now I'm in the subway.  Anyway, how do I change into the other clothes so when I pop out somewhere else in the city,  they don't got me again? 
[00:06:00]  That's just it.  I've thought about this.  There'll be video of you with the clothes on and then coming out of the same place with  the new clothes.  And they'll go, well, he's wearing those new clothes.  So they'll catch me changing into my new clothes, right?  Yeah.  That's what I thought.  I've thought the same.  Do you really think this shit?  You have no idea.  Oh, thank God.  Because I thought I was the same daydream.  Okay.  Probably about the same company, President.  But no, like, what would I do?  Would I...  I'm like, well, can I jump into a Dunkin' Donuts bathroom or something?  I'm like, no, they got cameras in there. 
[00:06:30]  Fuck.  Cameras.  So then you've got to, like, attempt to, like, just change your clothes in public and hope  no one sees you.  But you've got to find a place that doesn't have cameras.  First you go...  Which is almost impossible.  You're on a cab.  You're on a cab.  I've thought of doing it in a cab.  Like, just not your pants, but, like, you just take off one and put on a brighter...  Cab driver rats you out there.  But he could, but he might not know what you were doing.  You're paying cash.  Well, how about you change your clothes in the back of the cab without him knowing it?  You could do that.  I thought of that.  Aren't there those cameras in the cab now, too?  I thought of that.  Oh, fuck, so you can't do that.  In the front of the cab that takes your picture, so... 
[00:07:00]  Any subway you get on, they could catch you walking down any block on some security camera  and then going into the subway and see where you came out.  You do a crime.  They see that on the street.  They see which subway you go into.  Yeah.  So you're fucked to that point.  And my whole thing is, all right, but I'll pop out somewhere else.  But they'll find you popping out somewhere else.  You gotta go to...  So you gotta change your clothes.  But how do you change your clothes?  Maybe you take a chance and you dip onto the tracks.  Oh, no, but then they'll see you coming up with your new clothes on.  Fuck.  You gotta go to the pay and spray first. 
[00:07:30]  No, if you get on a train, you get on a subway...  Back at a home base.  Right.  And then you put your new clothes on and the stars go away for the helicopter that's chasing you.  How about if you go off hours onto the subway where there's no people in your particular train car?  But then they would know, right?  Cameras.  Oh, shit.  But there's no cameras on the train.  So if you went on the train and you wore, like, say, your outfit, but you and your backpack had a bright yellow sweatshirt and a hat, 
[00:08:00]  you could put that on on the train.  No one would notice you putting something over your regular clothing.  The jacket might kill you in the winter, so you better do it in the summer.  And then you fucking put a hat on.  But if they see you go to be a ditch to clothes, I will have your DNA on.  Oh, DNA.  You burn them.  I've thought of that, too.  You can't burn them?  No, you can't.  But you throw them in the garbage anywhere or in the sewer or somewhere that would get wet.  That's a rookie mistake.  I think they check the garbage cans.  Oh, garbage is like...  Crime is committed.  They go and check garbage cans right away.  Yep. 
[00:08:30]  Hudson River.  Check all the garbage cans on the perimeter.  Right.  Wow, Jimmy has really thought this out, too.  Have you?  Yeah, yeah.  You kind of think, like, wow, you can't get away with anything.  Right.  You kind of go through it in your head.  And it's...  Maybe you blow off the subway, but you can't do a cab.  No.  And I thought maybe you could walk it out.  But they're going to catch you on a million cameras at that point.  Yeah.  Maybe you do a little dipsy doodle, though.  You kind of dip it to this place for a little while.  And then when you come out the other side, what happens? 
[00:09:00]  So many cameras.  I've thought of this, too.  And this may come back to haunt me someday.  But because cell phones are so trackable, you need a partner for this.  But if you're going to commit a murder, you have somebody on your cell phone in one location  just texting and talking to somebody you know.  So this way, if it ever comes up and they want to track your cell phone, your phone is  in another location.  Now, again, that's not proof that you had it.  But it is some type of a thing that goes, look, my cell phone, you know.  A little doubt.  But the problem with that is now you've got to kill your friend because you can't trust 
[00:09:30]  him.  You can't trust him.  He's got to go.  Because he's going to panic.  Right.  He's going to help you.  Friends will help you, but they'll also panic on you.  So now you've got to take him out.  But he'd have to explain why he was texting on your phone while you committed a homicide.  So he's a party to it.  Even though you'd get more time, he'd probably go to jail, too.  Right.  So you use him, but then you fucking surprise him with a hit.  See, I haven't gotten all the way through this normally because I'd come at one point.  Boy, it's not that easy. 
[00:10:00]  I'm not saying it doesn't matter if you change your clothes because of facial recognition  software.  But is that in this subways and closed-circuit television?  It's not that much.  Not yet.  I knew a guy, and all he told me was that they got some good shit.  That's all he would say.  He might have worked for a task force or two, and he said they got really good shit  that would surprise the hell out of the average person walking around New York.  Yeah.  But he wouldn't say what.  It's growing on me. 
[00:10:30]  Mm-hmm.  But I don't doubt.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When we stop talking like that, it's just because someone's walking by the studio that they want  to check out.  Yes.  Normally, it's one of the men from the OutQ channel.  And they do it on purpose because they know we look.  EJ in Atlanta, what's up?  Morning, boys.  Hey, buddy.  Morning, Opie.  Unfortunately, I've thought about this several, several times myself.  The best thing I come up with is to start out shaved head with a wig, facial hair, two 
[00:11:00]  sets of clothing with the top clothing being Velcro.  So you can just snatch it right off and dispose of it anywhere, then dispose of the hair.  Like a male stripper.  I like the Velcro angle, but I don't like the shaved head angle because that's very suspicious.  Uh-huh.  Because that means you changed your look.  Why'd you do that?  Yeah, why did you shave your head?  Well, I shaved my head because it all started falling out, so I just went ahead and shaved 
[00:11:30]  it all off.  So you've established that look, though.  You have to have that look for a while.  Right.  Bob Kelly can do it because he's been bald for years now.  You can't just be bald, and then a week later, your wife is dead.  Yeah.  Right.  You walk out of your house, and all of a sudden, you're bald as you're checking your mailbox.  Yeah.  That might be a bit suspicious.  Yeah.  But I have cameras in my building, too, so I have to consider that as well because living  in the city here, you have so many more cameras.  Uh-huh.  And I'm like, well, they could just subpoena my building cameras and say, well, what time 
[00:12:00]  did he leave the building in the elevators or through the lot?  There's so many ways to get busted.  Right.  At every single step of a crime.  I had cops come to my house to ask if they could look at my cameras because something  happened down the block.  Really?  Yeah.  And they looked at everybody's house, saw who had cameras, and they asked to look at the  cameras.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah, they don't fuck around, man.  No.  Let's say hi to Greg in D.C.  Greg?  Greg?  Good morning, boy.  Oh, God.  I hate that one. 
[00:12:30]  Me, too.  What's up, Greg?  All right.  Anyway, perfect way to commit a bank robbery.  What you got to do is rubber cement on the fingers.  You got to put the plastic fake bald head.  Then you put on a rip-off track suit over the clothes that you're going to be wearing once  you get done committing the robbery.  See, yeah.  You got to go fake bald head because that would throw people off because then when they arrest 
[00:13:00]  you to question you, they'll pull out your hair and go, wait, what the fuck?  This guy was bald.  Fake bald head.  Right.  Fake bald head, but you put a hat over it.  Right.  You wear glasses, and then you have some, uh, the rubber cement goes on your face and on  your hands so that none of the DNA comes off it.  This is a Columbo episode.  Do I have rubber cement?  Let's get it.  And then rubber cement because you're not going to sweat through it.  What?  Um, see, what do you mean when you...  You open a cab after you get done robbing the bank and you go straight to a gym. 
[00:13:30]  But, you know what?  You failed to.  To a gym?  Because if you're going to rob a bank, you're going to have some kind of gloves on.  Because it's going to be pretty damn obvious you're robbing the bank, so...  Of course you have gloves on, but you have the rubber cement on under your gloves.  Because if you wear plastic gloves, your fingerprints still go on them.  Oh, oh, oh.  I see what you're saying.  Oh, oh.  You have a gym bag that you stuff all the stuff into.  Yep.  You have two gym bags in each bag.  The first bag is the one everyone sees.  You get in the cab. 
[00:14:00]  You take the first gym bag off the second gym bag.  You stuff all three gym bags.  You just...  What do you think the cab driver's doing?  Yeah, I know.  And the camera in the cab.  And the driver's in the front?  By the way...  That's fine.  He can't see the floor.  Where does the cab pick you up?  Is it where all the squad cars are outside the bank in less than a minute?  Yes.  In New York City.  You don't do this in New York City where the traffic's too heavy.  You do it in the city where the traffic's slightly heavy, and you do it at a time when you've  already pre...  You've already checked out the bank, and you've made sure when the police are not closest. 
[00:14:30]  You're in for 30 seconds and out.  That's it.  This isn't someone trying to make millions.  It's just a bunch of bored guys like yourselves who are trying to make a little extra fun.  That's funny.  All right.  There you go.  Thank you, Greg.  Isn't it funny how...  I thought I was the only one that did this.  It makes me very happy that this is something other people talk about.  But isn't it funny how transparent other people's crime...  Like, I walk through my own.  I'm like, that's pretty good, pretty good.  But then when you hear somebody else describe it, you're like, here's where you're going 
[00:15:00]  to get busted, dumbbell.  And in 30 seconds, they're caught.  There was a Twilight Zone episode where some guy at the bank, all of a sudden, he was able  to hear people's thoughts.  And he ratted out this old guy at the bank because he heard his thoughts.  And he's like, I'll take the money and then I'm going to hop on a plane and I'm going  to go down to South America and stuff.  And the guy's like, fuck.  So he ratted him out.  The guy's like, it turned out he fantasizes about that every day for 30 years.  Really?  Working at the bank every day. 
[00:15:30]  He just goes, okay, I'll steal the money.  I'll do it.  But he never does it.  Right.  But then he was like, how did you know that I was doing this?  Oh, my God.  That's a good one.  I got to start watching more Twilight Zones.  I love them Twilight Zones.  Bill in Georgia.  Bill?  Hello, Bill.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Might I remind you, you are a multi-millionaire.  You don't have to commit crimes.  Damn, I got to go check my bank statement.  Damn, nice.  Thanks, Bill. 
[00:16:00]  It's all right.  We got a guy that actually pulled off a crime.  Oh, really?  He's called from jail.  Oh, he hung up.  Why was he wearing a crime?  Fuck.  He got scared.  He hung up.  Oh, see?  He said that he used a Big Bird costume to pull off a...  A Big Bird costume?  It just said to pull off a crime.  Well, I think the best time to rob a bank is Halloween, obviously.  Right.  You could dress like anything.  You could go out and all of a sudden you're, you know, you pick a very popular costume. 
[00:16:30]  Right.  You can do it that way.  We got an FBI guy on the line.  Oh, really?  Tim Monaghan.  Tim.  Hi, Tim.  This is Tim Monaghan, FBI.  Could I get the name and number of that gentleman that just talked about the rubber cement in the bags?  Oh, you need that information.  He has a cracked FBI agent.  He called up and asked for himself.  Hi, Tim.  I mean, the guys.  We're on the case, are you?  It's really Tony for Brooklyn. 
[00:17:00]  Have a good day.  Of course it is.  Yeah, but that one phone call was a little.  That guy really thought about it.  He might have got a little taste.  Maybe.  He might have got a little taste back in the day.  Yeah.  Just a little taste.  Little?  You don't go too crazy.  Oh, fuck.  This is a good idea.  Frank on Long Island.  Frank.  Frank.  Hey, guys.  I got the perfect way to do it.  You wear a fat suit and you wear shoes with lifts in it.  So you look like you're taller and fatter than you really are. 
[00:17:30]  You're dumped into the subway.  You get out that tunnel.  You take off the fat suit.  Take off the lifts.  When you come out the other end, you're wearing the uniform of a subway worker.  And you look perfect like you belong there.  That's true.  And then they're all hunting for the guy in Scarface who got on stage, got shot.  Yeah, yeah.  The big fat thing.  Whatever his name was.  That fucking awful thing.  Terrible show that was.  Yes.  Horrible.  You look like a fat guy, but now you're not a fat guy.  But as soon as they find the fat suit somewhere down below in the subway system, then they 
[00:18:00]  know.  There's a thousand places to put things in the subway tunnel they'd never find.  Grates.  Things.  The tunnels.  Grates.  I think they check grates.  They check garbage pails and grates.  Then you put it in your backpack and you take it with you and you dump it later on.  Here's a video of him jumping off of the platform running down the tunnel.  Here it is.  With what looks like a fat suit.  We need your help.  Obviously, he's wearing a fat suit.  Because here's a video of him coming back out skinny.  I didn't say I had a purpose. 
[00:18:30]  That's why I'm working.  I haven't figured it out all the way out, but the fat suit and the height would work.  I kind of like the fat suit idea with the lips.  That'll throw him off for a little bit.  It'll give you a little time to get out of the state.  You put the bald facial hair and if you really want to get crazy, your little shoe polish  change the color a little bit.  Yeah, the one guy fucked up by saying bald head with the wig.  You got to go fake bald head.  Right.  Fake bald head.  Right.  You put a little spray tan on, you know, something like that so you look a little different. 
[00:19:00]  Then all of a sudden you'll have some self-esteem and you won't need to go out and rob a bank.  You'll be like, let's go out and meet someone.  That'll look great.  Or you just become a radio show host.  You got a million dollars.  There you go.  What about all the years where we made shit money?  That's right.  What do you mean?  Listen, I've been listening all those years you made shit money and I agree with you.  Could have used some bank robbery money.  There's the BAB days when you made nothing going to the park bench for happy hours.  Oh, fuck. 
[00:19:30]  Did I give you a bumper sticker at the park bench?  I probably did.  I hope so.  You gave me a stack to cover my pickup truck with.  Oh, right on.  All right, brother.  You've been with us a long time.  Thanks, Frank.  It was a long time.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  Frank.  Frank.  Let's say hi to Daniel in Korea.  Oh, the Korean dude's calling.  What's up, brother?  Morning, boy.  Hey.  Morning.  Hey, a good way to get away with murder.  One, you got to do it on your feet.  You can't be in your vehicle because they'll pull your E-ZPass record, see what toll wave you were on.  And you got to do it like an E-ZPass when you're dropping a bank. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, everyone knows that.  Don't use E-ZPass.  You can't jump in your car and go through a toll.  Yeah, just like divorce proceedings.  They'll pull that shit real quick.  You can do it like American Psycho.  I'll find some random bum and just fucking kill him.  Walk away.  Well, that's just...  Right.  It's not getting money.  No.  This is all about maybe getting money.  We're talking some bank robbery.  Right.  You know.  Yeah.  All right.  It's very impossible.  Oh, fuck.  This is a great idea. 
[00:20:30]  I was ready to move on, but this is a great idea.  John on Long Island.  John.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, what's going on?  I think you should really use a Todd show van as a getaway car.  Yeah, no one will give a shit about that.  No one will see it.  Hey, put some mud on, put some dreds on, you're good to go.  I like to...  Thank you, sir.  And you're segging to our next little thing we're going to do on the show.  Yeah.  I was walking in today, and I was hearing, I swear to you, just horrendous audio coming 
[00:21:00]  from one of the computers, and E-Rock was in front.  Oh.  I go, what the fuck is that?  Because the Todd show.  I go, are we going to pull clips from the show today?  Because, you know, we're going to try to move on a little bit.  Uh-huh.  We'll keep an eye on the damn guy, but he goes, you have to play this.  It's a horrendous song parody to start a show.  Oh, a song parody.  Oh, a lot of shoehorning.  So I don't know if that's ready to go, but...  I hope so.  But the Todd show thing has really, really taken off with the listeners.  Why would they keep doing song... 
[00:21:30]  Did someone tell them, like, this is with any radio...  Like, is the song parody a big listen?  It must be a staple of Todd.  The problem with Todd is this.  He wants to reinvent himself, so he should just fucking not do any of that stuff for the  first, I don't know, first hundred days, let's say.  Just talk and let everyone get to know...  And then maybe slide that shit back in.  The crew.  But you're making it sound too much like the Scott and Todd show, which was a bust at the  end.  Yeah.  The ratings weren't that great.  They were just kind of, you know, kind of just surviving. 
[00:22:00]  And Scott Shannon's in the paper today talking about his new gig, which we'll be taking a  listen to on Monday.  I cannot wait for that.  That's going to be horrendous.  I'm going to see me out.  But he's pretty much hinting that, you know, that there's bad blood between him and Todd.  And so on.  You don't think it's going to be a good show?  Oh, it's going to be horrendous.  Because he just can't do it anymore.  I want to know who his little sidekick's going to be. 
[00:22:30]  Got to have somebody besides the weather guys.  Fuck, where is it?  I don't know if he'll...  I read this shit and then I don't know what paper was in.  I don't know if he'll be as bad as they were.  If he's now the lead again, just talking.  He's not going to just talk.  But I bet you his mic time will be very, very short.  Very minimal.  Very minimal, yes.  If he's just throwing a song, will it be as bad?  Yeah.  He'll just be introing songs in and out, do a little weather, do a little traffic, and  that's it.  That's going to be terrible.  It's going to be horrendous.  I think it's in the other paper. 
[00:23:00]  I predict awfulness.  Anyone have the other paper?  Which one do you have?  Papers.  Get the papers.  The post?  Yeah, yeah.  I got the post.  The post?  No, it's called the post, not the post.  One of the greatest murder weapons would be an icicle.  Heard about that.  Yeah, but then you have a bunch of water with blood.  I thought you'd drink it when you're done with it.  There was a Alfred Hitchcock, I think it was, where a woman beat her husband to death 
[00:23:30]  with a frozen leg of lamb.  Right.  And then she cooked it and served it to the police that came over to investigate.  The police ate the murder weapon.  What fucking cops eat leg of lamb on murder investigation?  Back in the 50s, you could come over and say we're eating dinner.  Oh, sit down.  Right.  Sit down.  I kind of remember that one.  And then you immediately divert them from their attention by saying, and a Negro played  loud music.  He did.  Well, give us some lamb, man.  And they all agree wholeheartedly. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, here it is.  It's on page 52 of the post.  What?  Under Star Report, which you and I normally read together, back-to-back on the toilet.  Star Report.  Star Report.  Where is it?  My page...  Yeah, page 52.  Well, that didn't take long.  Veteran DJ Scott Shannon, who announced his exit from PLJ's popular long-running Scott and  Todd morning show, has landed at CBSFR as the oldie station's morning drive guy.  Shannon kicked out...  Oh, no, it says kicks off Scott Shannon in the morning. 
[00:24:30]  This Monday, he'll be joined by Mr. G.  Ah, Mr. G.  And traffic reporter Joe Nolan.  By the way, so much for a no-compete clause, right?  Right?  Look at that shit.  Right out of it.  Five days later.  Right there.  Because they wanted him out.  But this is a lot of telling stuff in here.  It was time.  Todd...  This is Scott Shannon talking.  It was time.  Todd is very qualified to do the show on his own.  And so am I, he told me.  We worked together longer than most teams even think about working together. 
[00:25:00]  And it was just time for me to leave.  He's the younger guy.  And he's felt like he could do the show alone for a couple of years now.  That's, uh...  You gotta read between the lines, as they say.  I learned from him, and he learned from me.  I really needed to reboot my career and do something else.  So...  Reboot.  By the way, that's...  You know what?  All that stuff on the pain-o-mind list and stuff like that, that shows you how right that was.  He really was...  Because we saw that fucking years ago.  Yeah.  He wants this old guy out, quote-unquote.  The pain-o-mind list. 
[00:25:30]  He was constantly on that.  But he thinks he's this young, hip, relevant fucking radio guy, this fucking Todd.  He's older than us.  I know.  Stop.  He's older than us.  But he can put together a song parody.  Oh, my gosh.  I'm on Team Scott.  Oh, nice.  100%.  But we're gonna have to beat the shit out of him on Monday.  Mercilessly.  Because the audio we're gonna get is gonna be horrible.  Mercilessly.  It'll be relentless.  Yeah, yeah.  And what about competing directly with Todd?  Todd, well, we'll both be on the air at the same time. 
[00:26:00]  Will there be some looky-loos back and forth?  Yeah.  Looky-loos.  He said.  But the music on the two stations is so different.  And there's a lot of great morning shows in this market.  There's something for everyone.  I got a looky-loo.  Yep.  The younger guy thought he could...  The younger guy, Scott was trying to...  Fucking Scott brings him on.  And he's been...  And Todd has been trying to get rid of Scott for all these years.  And then Scott's probably like, all right, fuck you.  I'm done.  I'm out of here.  And maybe PLG's like, we need a younger sound.  Oh, yeah.  That's what they did.  And then they loaded up his show with, you know, younger people. 
[00:26:30]  Right.  I can't blame Todd for being mad that he wants to bring in fucking Joe Nolan every day and  talk to him.  I'm mad if you have Joe Nolan.  No disrespect to Joe Nolan, but he's a big fat guy.  He's a giant beach ball.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who really cares?  Sonny, is it, Joe?  Tell us more about that, Joe.  Yeah, well.  Before we play this parody from The Todd Show, we're helping them trend every day on Twitter.  This guy got away with serious crimes for about 10 years.  I was hoping this little discussion would go in this direction. 
[00:27:00]  How should I?  Our agent.  Dave.  What's up, Dave?  Hey, what's happening?  Hey, man.  Hey, buddy.  Can you guys hear me?  Yes, Dave.  Oh, yeah.  Loud and clear.  Yeah, I just jumped on maybe about 10, 15 minutes ago, a long-time listener, but we  were getting away with stuff.  Well, the feds, when they finally caught up with us, said we were doing it for about  30, but we were only actually doing stuff for maybe a little over 10 years. 
[00:27:30]  But the only thing I was wanting to add is, unfortunately, people like to talk.  Even if you do people off a perfect crime, it just seems like there's always somebody  out there running their mouths.  That's what it is.  People will talk.  That's why I don't believe 9-11 was an inside job.  Yeah.  Someone would have fucking yapped by now.  But what kind of crimes did you get away with before you got caught?  Well, we started off doing little stuff.  We were doing credit unions, pharmacies, and one of the biggest things that actually turned 
[00:28:00]  against us was we were in Indiana going through a roof in a credit union, and a bread delivery  truck broke down one of our license plates.  You were going through the roof?  Yeah, we'd go in at night and dismantle safes or hit the drawers.  A lot of the smaller banks, they'd leave cash in their cash drawers.  Holy fuck.  When we eventually got hit, we all took plea agreements for 14 years, did 10 of the 14 under 
[00:28:30]  the old federal law.  They weren't considered armed robbery because we never did do anything during daylight or  15 hours.  You were those criminals like in the movies.  People like them because they don't do anything.  Yeah, you're going through the roof at night.  Isn't it amazing?  This guy did 10 years for that, and you can molest a kid and be out in five or seven years.  Sure.  Crazy.  So the bread truck guys got you.  That was the one that got you, huh?  Well, I think they knew for a long time.  I think that was just one of the pieces they needed, but under our discovery packet, there 
[00:29:00]  was a lot of people that were talking for years and years and years whenever somebody  in our neighborhood where we grew up, somebody gets hit with, I don't know, pot or pills or  something.  The first thing they want to say is, hey, I know these guys.  Make a deal, yeah.  So why did so many people know what you guys were up to?  Right.  Well, none of us had jobs.  All right.  But also in discovery, do they give out the names of people when you're going through your 
[00:29:30]  discovery packet?  Like you'll find out the names of informants?  I don't think they would give that out.  It'll just say CC, government, informant, or, you know, I mean, it's not hard to put  two and two together when, you know.  Yeah, you know somebody that's been busted, they get out, and all of a sudden the feds are  knocking on your door.  How long have you been out now?  I got out in 01, March of 01.  Oh, okay.  This goes way back.  Are you keeping your nose clean? 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, I miss a lot of friends.  I miss the money, you know, and easy money is easy gone.  Wow.  What kind of work do you do now?  You don't have to be, you know, really specific.  I just general contracting.  Yeah, okay.  The one thing I got to ask you, we all have those weird fucking nightmares, and then we  wake up in the morning and go, oh, fuck.  Thank God.  It was just a fucking dream.  I'm not in trouble.  Now, you had all this shit going on.  How the hell did you sleep at night, knowing that at any moment that door could be knocking 
[00:30:30]  and they're coming to get you?  Well, I didn't have all the shit going on.  I was a part of it.  Right.  Yeah, but still, you have to think, you know.  At some point, they came for you.  Right, right.  Yeah, but I mean, when you're young, it's easy to sleep when you've got a new Corvette or  a new Harley.  Oh, shit.  It's got a living large.  A pink Cadillac.  That's in my wife's name.  Yeah.  It's in my wife's name.  What's the matter with you?  What's the matter with you?  Sorry.  Was it a relief when you got caught in a weird way or not really? 
[00:31:00]  Uh, it was for me because I knew what was going on and it wasn't, you know, didn't take  long to figure out what was going on.  I took off and ran for six months.  Ooh.  On the lam.  Ended up getting caught, of course.  I got pulled over in a beat-up pickup truck with a vet tag on it.  So, you know.  But you were on the lam for six months.  That's pretty impressive.  That doesn't seem like an easy thing to do.  Like, how do you get money and stuff?  Just work, construction, cash. 
[00:31:30]  Wow.  What, did they pull you over and you had, like, warrants?  Yeah.  Pulled over and, uh.  What were you doing when you got pulled over?  Something stupid?  Oh, yeah.  I was speeding.  Ah, these guys always do this.  Why?  All those shows I watch, it's always something stupid.  Ten and two.  Drive like a human for fucking.  You gotta.  You gotta.  You're on the lam.  You're on the lam.  You gotta drive nice.  So, you get pulled over for speeding and then they run your tags and that was it.  Fuck. 
[00:32:00]  That's the fuck you to do, right?  I thought we could take care of it right here and bring it.  Right, right.  Somebody had a great idea on how to not get caught.  Somebody said, uh, just put on blackface and then the news won't put out a concise description.  Yeah, I was just wanting to holler at you and, uh.  All right.  Well, thanks for, wow, thanks for sharing.  This is pretty, pretty wild.  It always seems like you got a perfect crime and there's always some little motherfucker with his mouth open somewhere, you know?  Right.  That's where you gotta do it all by yourself. 
[00:32:30]  Thank you, Dave.  All right.  I like you guys and I appreciate all you guys doing.  Thank you, brother.  All right.  Thank God you like us.  Yeah, that's a.  We want you guys on our side.  He's all reformed, apparently.  Right.  Thanks, Dave.  Sounds like more of the same to me.  That's gotta be, uh.  Oh, but you get caught speeding.  Speeding.  What is it?  I would never speed again.  Oh, I'd be the greatest driver ever.  I imagine that.  You're like, I have warrants out.  I'm fucking, uh, on the lam.  But I guess after a while you're like, you know what? 
[00:33:00]  I think I'm, I think.  You think I'm all right?  I think I'm good.  I'm all right.  I think I'm good.  Oh, speedy.  Fuck.  It's always something stupid.  Right.  When they pick up those guys, you watch, uh, episodes of, uh, cops and stuff, and they pick  up the guys with fucking coke in their trunk.  Mm-hmm.  It's always like, hey, you, you didn't signal, or you were speeding, or something.  It's always like, what the fuck are you thinking with a trunk full of coke?  Well, how did they get Son of Sam again?  Was it parking tickets?  Yeah, he had a parking ticket, and, uh. 
[00:33:30]  While he was committing one of the murders.  Why wouldn't you pay those off?  Well, just the fact that it had happened.  It wasn't necessarily unpaid, but it was the fact that it had been issued while he was  doing that.  Right.  So even if it was paid, they had a record that it was issued.  Yeah.  That's some amazing police work back then.  But so he parked illegal?  Illegally?  It might have been a hydrant, or too close to a hydrant.  It might not have been something so obvious.  Who knows?  That's lazy.  I know.  This is before computers, like all this stuff.  Before cameras everywhere, before computers.  That's lazy.  You got to just.  Old school cop work.  You got to just keep driving around the blocks until somebody pulls out. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Somebody.  He probably saw some couple making out, though.  Right.  He's like, ooh, I have to kill them.  Making out.  Making out.  That was in my head a little yesterday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little bit.  Get over it.  That was the one that I had.  All day.  I had a little get over it in my head.  Did you?  So, yeah.  But making out was really like.  Oh, that was the number one?  What about Valkyrie?  No.  That one didn't get me.  Instantly went out of my head.  Yeah.  Valkyrie.  The least catchy tune ever written.  Making out got me.  And boy, get over it.  What? 
[00:34:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you too?  Get over it.  Yeah.  Traffic-wise, Randy Kraft was a serial killer a lot of people don't know.  Brutal, I think he was a.  He would smother people with cheese slices.  There was a book about him, and I think he got pulled over with a body in the car or a dead Marine in the car or something.  Oh, what's his name down in Florida?  Jeffrey Dom.  No, no, no.  Yes, Ted Bundy.  Ted Bundy. 
[00:35:00]  Ted Bundy.  Had gotten away, escaped from jail in Colorado, and then in Florida, he gets busted with some little murderous Volkswagen.  Volkswagen, yeah.  With no passenger seat.  No passenger seat.  That much easier.  Handcuffs.  You didn't want to get a ride from a guy with handcuffs and no passenger seat.  He didn't play.  No.  He did not play.  All right.  We got food in front of us.  When we get back, we've got a little salt.  All right.  A laughs for everybody.  A few laughs.  A few laughs for everybody.  On the show today, Elijah Wood. 
[00:35:30]  And Teddy Lang.  Ted Lang.  Jesus, what were we thinking?  Did I just say that out loud?  I predict he will be fun.  You're a bartender.  I predict Ted Lang is going to be fun.  I predict he will be.  Old school.  Roland's got to stop with those sad eyes.  Is it his sad eyes?  Yes.  And then I go, all right, all right.  All right.  We'll take that guy.  He comes in looking like the Mack truck dog.  All fucking all pettable.  Oh, he's very sad.  Yeah.  Could you take Ted Lang if you get a show? 
[00:36:00]  You want to talk about some dude that was murdered?  Fuck yeah.  Hold on.  By the guy who killed him.  I'd love to.  It's Stacey.  Oh, no.  Stacey in Indiana.  What's up, Stacey?  You wanted it more than I did.  Hold on, Stacey.  The laughs are aplenty right now.  Go ahead, Stacey.  Stacey.  Hi.  Hi, Stacey.  How are you?  Good.  Your husband was murdered in 2005?  Yeah.  He was a jailer out of Bloomington, Indiana. 
[00:36:30]  And he was driving home.  And this guy had been in the jail for about six months.  Oh, man.  And he had an AR-15 on a bipod.  My husband was driving a big truck, getting off work.  And the guy shot him in the back of the head.  My husband didn't even know it.  Now, so this guy obviously had a thing for you, like a vendetta against your husband for  what happened, right?  Yeah, that is exactly right.  You can look it up on the Internet. 
[00:37:00]  And the guy was talking about, they're called redactions.  And when you look at court documents, they'll redact things.  I used to work as a child caseworker.  And they'll redact things that are really hard to read.  And, but the guy was talking about that you can, you can tell who told on you.  Uh-huh.  And all through the trial, you could tell, you know, who told on this guy, how he was 
[00:37:30]  caught.  Who told on him?  Was it a guy, an old cellmate or an old cellmate?  No, his roommate actually called in a bomb threat because he was so afraid of his old  roommate.  He was actually afraid of him.  This guy was so sneaky that he melted down an AR-15 in the Hoosier National Forest so he  wouldn't get caught.  Wow.  That's pretty smart, actually.  Melted down the murder weapon. 
[00:38:00]  Uh, right.  My late husband's father is a physicist and he tried it himself.  He said it takes less than a half hour.  It's nothing but ash.  Wow.  It's nothing but ash.  So your husband felt nothing, though?  Pardon?  Your husband had no pain at all, right?  It was just probably like he just went...  No, they, they, that's my saving grace.  Um, he felt nothing, they said.  You sound, I have to, you sound a little cheery.  It's bothering me.  No, I...  You hear that, right, Jay? 
[00:38:30]  My son and I, my son and I listen to you every morning while I'm at work.  Oh, thank you.  It's like it was a while ago, too, you know.  You move on.  Jesus.  Have you found...  It's been nine years and I'm with this great guy.  Oh.  He's great.  Yeah.  You know, I've moved on.  Wow.  My husband's in...  My husband is in, um, heaven, I believe, in the afterlife.  Heaven.  People don't.  Yeah.  And, um, he's looking down on us.  We had one great little guy.  And, uh, the guy that told on him said that if I had not gone on, uh, TV and radio and 
[00:39:00]  asked him to find this asshole, um, that he wouldn't have told.  Wow.  He said that in an open court.  My son, who was eight years old at the time of the, uh, sentencing hearing, called him  a coward.  Oh.  Pointed at him.  Yeah.  I've got a great kid.  Damn.  Just like his dad.  Yeah.  Wow.  Jesus.  No, you guys are great.  I've always wanted to talk to Jimmy.  Oh. 
[00:39:30]  And, uh, Anthony.  Yeah.  Oh.  I loved him.  Yeah.  And I hope he, too, but...  Oh.  That's all good.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's a hell of a story.  Exactly.  All right, Stacy.  I don't...  Thank you.  I don't really know what to say about that, but thanks for...  It's only here in Indiana.  We're freezing our asses off at negative eight.  Right.  Jesus.  All right.  Same size as my penises.  Negative eight.  Well, you guys have a great day.  Yeah, you too, Stacy.  All right.  Bye, Stacy.  All right.  Goodbye. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  Jesus.  Sounds like a bunch of bullshit to me.  That's a nice story.  Yeah.  Holy fuckaroni.  That's the way to go.  If you're going to get shot, back of the head.  Keep that in mind, Travis.  Hello.  This is Ricky.  They're a big 90s man, right?  Yeah.  No, I mean, I know who they are, but I always...  I would say so.  Yeah.  Are they still together or no?  I don't know.  Sort of.  Sort of?  Yeah.  Billy's still doing smashing moments.  Yeah.  Billy Corgan's smashing moments. 
[00:40:30]  Get over it.  Yeah.  With the at Billy name on fucking Twitter.  Think how many people wanted that one.  He must have been a fan who got it, right?  He was the one that got it.  That's pretty impressive.  Yeah.  Well, I asked Robert Rodriguez yesterday.  How did he just get Rodriguez?  Like, a fan got me, Jim.  A lot of Rodriguez.  Yeah.  So sometimes someone who likes you will save it.  Yeah.  Is this the name show that Ted Lang is on?  We're only two and a half hours away from Ted Lang. 
[00:41:00]  Yes.  People, I wouldn't go anywhere.  From Ted Lang.  Can we see?  Oh, that was him?  Make it bigger.  I can't see Ted Lang.  That was Ted.  He does the little point at you from behind the bar.  He's the show's bartender?  What?  What are we doing?  Oh, boy.  There he is.  He's the bartender on the show.  Your bartender.  Wait, it's not his TV show?  No.  No.  He's just the bartender on a shitty TV show?  Oh, jeez.  He's the bartender.  No.  What's the name of this show?  It's called Mind of a Man. 
[00:41:30]  Mind of a Man.  It's on the...  Game Show Network.  The Game Show Network.  It is?  All right.  Game Show Network.  Mind of a Man.  GSN.  Each episode will feature two women answering questions previously asked and answered by a  survey of a hundred men.  During the three rounds, contestants will try to determine correct answers with the help of participating  celebrities.  I thought he was the host of the show.  That's what I thought.  No.  He's the bartender.  So what does he do?  Gives you the pointers.  He points at you?  Like, hey.  And then what did he use to say?  Did he say anything on Love Boat? 
[00:42:00]  Did he have a catchphrase or did he just point?  I think he just pointed.  That's what he does on the show, then.  Isaac, your bartender.  Right.  Now he's Ted Lang, your bartender.  Yeah.  What?  Yeah.  Ted Lang is the bartender on the show Mind of a Man on the GSN.  His bio's a little light.  He's a little thin.  Doing my research right now.  He once bought Gene Kelly a drink in Hong Kong.  What?  Anthony.  Oh.  In Hong Kong?  In Hong Kong.  Gene Kelly?  Gene Kelly a drink in Hong Kong. 
[00:42:30]  Bought him a drink in Hong Kong?  That's right.  Gene Kelly doing it in Hong Kong.  He may have been there to watch a sporting event.  What?  I know that Hong Kong does host a few things.  What kind of sports is Hong Kong?  Well, there was one big event one time, apparently.  King Kong was over there.  King Kong.  King Kong went to Hong Kong.  Yeah.  He was there.  For the sporting event?  Yeah. 
[00:43:00]  It was to play ping pong.  And it was very unique, the way he played.  He used his ding dong.  No way.  Yes.  I swear to you.  You want to learn more about Ted Lang?  I certainly do.  His finger thing towards the camera?  Yeah.  That was an ad-lib, everyone.  Wow.  He just decided to do that one day in the love boat, and they liked it?  You're kidding me.  That's famous.  That was an ad-lib.  What was the finger thing towards the boat? 
[00:43:30]  I don't remember.  He would do, like...  They used to do the credits inside the little wheel, inside the little ship wheel.  Oh, right.  Right.  And it would be, Isaac, your bartender.  Right.  Because it was like, you're, you know, purser yeoman.  You're this cruise director.  And he would go, I'll give you a little point, and hey, I'm here for you.  If you hear me say yuck really loud, that's because Ted Lang did that to us.  Oh, no. 
[00:44:00]  Later on this morning?  Yes.  He's going to do it.  Right away.  I bet the second he walks in the door.  Here it is.  The second that door opens, we go, hey, Ted Lang, he's going to go, hey, he's going to go, yuck.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  He appeared in 250 episodes of The Love Boat.  How many episodes were there of that fucking show?  Probably 250.  He's going to do 250.  He thought there was only 200.  He just did 50 more on spec.  He directed 12 and wrote five. 
[00:44:30]  Wow.  They throw him bones after a while, yeah.  I'm sorry.  He wrote the famous, remember the episode where Gavin McCloud got his ass eaten?  Captain Steuben got his ass eaten.  The ship ran aground because he wasn't where he was supposed to be.  Ginger Rogers once told him he was a wonderful actor.  Ginger Rogers was on The Love Boat, I bet.  Right.  According to IMDb, he won the Renaissance Man Theater Award from the NAACP. 
[00:45:00]  All right.  And he directed one episode of Fantasy Island.  Oh, wow.  The pillow on the chest one.  Oh, God.  Yes.  It was Mr. Rourke's fantasy.  Yeah.  Some midget he knew would fucking blow his chest out through a pillow.  Ouch.  It hurts.  Is that the intro?  And then there was...  When does the bio start?  Oh, see.  And then there was the time.  What did he do? 
[00:45:30]  Where's the other sheet for Ted Lang?  IMDb.  Yes.  Where is the other...  That is the complete Ted Lang bio.  So basically he hasn't done anything of significance since The Love Boat.  Well, when you're typecast as the bartender on a cruise ship, it's very hard to get work.  But now he's the bartender again.  On a really bad game show for the Game Show Network.  I have an interview from 2011.  Oh, you do?  I mean, should we do some research on the air?  Yes, please.  Maybe we can learn from this.  Because you are supposed to watch older interviews with your guests so you can gauge their personalities. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  So this is actually from...  Okay, so it's not like...  I mean, the Opie and Anthony show is a big media destination.  Thanks for saying it, Sam.  Because if we said it, we would look like assholes.  Right.  Yeah, only big media destinations like the Opie and Anthony show and the Thunder Valley Resort  get to interview Ted Lang.  Where is the...  What's the...  What is...  It's a casino and resort. 
[00:46:30]  Okay.  Okay?  All right.  Why are you halfway through the interview?  This is all intro.  Uh-huh.  What?  Oh, wait.  No, I got a third of the...  Oh, no.  Oh, get that.  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  I guess I shouldn't skip that.  Oh, no.  And who's that guy?  That looks like a wrestler.  That's the host?  Yeah, he's the host.  Okay.  Pendulum.  Just play this.  Come on.  Ted Lange, Thunder Valley says, thank you very much for coming on.  Is his name Ted Lange? 
[00:47:00]  Is it?  I am not calling him Ted Lange.  I have never heard him called anything but Ted Lange.  It's Ted Lange?  It might be Ted Lange.  You know what?  I'm saying Ted Lange.  I said it.  It was an E at the end, so...  So, you call him Ted Lange, and then we know either for your interview or this interview,  he didn't correct somebody mispronouncing his name.  Yeah.  Ted A!  Ted Lange.  Having a wonderful time and happy to be here.  And you know what?  After this, I'm going to go out there and make some money.  Hey, that's Tony Dow from Leave it to Beaver. 
[00:47:30]  Well, isn't it amazing that so many people love Love Boat.  They ask you a ton of questions up here.  What's the most common question that they ask you, Ted?  The most common question was how to make a margarita.  Fuck yeah!  He's incorrigible.  Get suited.  How to make a margarita.  All right.  Can I just issue a request?  This is not as a person who works here, but just as a fan of the show.  Could he be...  Can you guys, when he comes in, can you ask him, hey, Ted, how do you make a margarita? 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Did you do that?  Yeah.  No problem.  Except I'm not going to say Ted.  I have another name.  Oh, yeah.  Isaac?  No.  Uh-oh.  15-yard penalty?  No.  Okay.  Jesus.  All right.  I got my first question.  How do you...  Okay.  I think we could get him for the next Super Show to be, like... 
[00:48:30]  Wow.  The bartender in the corner.  The bartender at the Super Show?  Yes.  And I say, lots of tequila.  You can't go wrong.  How can you go wrong?  There you go.  How many episodes you guys did?  10?  Was it 10 or 11 years?  How many years?  10 years.  10 years we did.  10 years.  And did you ever do a resurrection show or anything like that?  Yeah, we did.  Actually, yeah.  We did...  Maybe about four years later, we did a reunion show.  And then another five years, they did a love boat, the new wave. 
[00:49:00]  And then they bought us all back for that.  Nice.  Yeah, yeah.  It was nice.  And then I directed a couple of those with Bob Yurt.  At this point, I'd like to jump in and go, Ted, enough about the boat.  Right.  Right.  Well, there's got to be something else.  It's all about the love boat.  That's it.  I'm sure Sal will be running in page two of the bio.  Yes.  He's right now fucking ironing on his new hipster beard.  All right. 
[00:49:30]  Remember, Bob, you're a great guy.  We did a Vegas together.  Did you?  Yeah.  He sounds like Kenneth in this guy when he talks.  Yeah, yeah.  Now, let me ask you a question.  How many episodes total?  I don't know.  Too many.  But it's over 200.  It's like over 250.  No, it's 250.  Ted, yeah, it is 200.  How could he not know?  I mean, are there that many questions that he gets asked that considering it hasn't come  up before?  Considering he has nothing else going on, you would think he would have counted all his  appearances.  This is by now. 
[00:50:00]  Oh.  What about the show on GSN?  Wait, so.  Nothing.  This is it.  When you came up with the finger thing, whose idea was that?  Oh, AdLib.  Yeah.  AdLib.  I mean, we're doing, you know, you're on camera.  The guy says, smile into the lens.  All right, everyone, I know how I'm going to say, I'm going to, I'm going to respond to that. 
[00:50:30]  I'm going to ask it.  Let's just pretend that.  Let's make believe we don't know, and we'll ask him about it.  Okay.  I think I know how I'm going to respond.  Try that again.  Let's hear everyone say that.  The question?  Yeah, and then his answer.  Okay.  I'm going to practice my response to him.  Okay.  When you came up with the finger thing, that was an ad.  Whose idea was that?  Oh, AdLib.  Get the fuck out of here.  Chris in New York goes, are you talking about the guy from Love Boat? 
[00:51:00]  Yes.  Where do you, hold on a minute.  I think we're.  Chris.  Opie.  Yeah.  How are you guys?  Hey.  Listen, it is Lange.  I think he's got the E at the end.  Yes, he does.  Yes, he does.  It's Lange.  Don't you guys do any research for Clayton Bay?  Well, we're trying.  But.  Yeah, you're trying.  Let me give you this but.  I feel like I've heard his name.  Ted Lange forever.  Yeah, forever.  Lange.  I've heard it before. 
[00:51:30]  You know, he used.  Well, then you get in here.  Lange is familiar.  Well, you're close.  Come on by and you can interview Ted Lange.  You'll interview him.  You're a big fucking fan.  Ted Lange.  Ted Lange.  Ted Lange.  All right, Chris.  Thank you.  Keep going there, Seth.  Enough to do.  Yeah, it's like.  I've heard Ted Lange.  And I'm going to start the interview by saying that.  I'll tell you, the son of the bitch looks good.  He's got gray hair, but he looks fucking the same as he looked 30 years ago.  Of course.  He has no stress or pressure.  Don't crack.  What do you mean?  He just sits around.  He talks about as pointing. 
[00:52:00]  Pointing.  His famous point.  That's what he's famous for.  All right.  Let's practice that again.  I don't want to curse.  Wait.  What are we doing?  Going backwards?  Yeah.  I hear that we're cursing too much.  Okay.  All right.  Here we go.  No.  Too many.  But it's over 200.  It's like over 250.  And when you came up with the finger thing.  That wasn't that.  Whose idea was that?  No.  Ad-lib.  What?  What? 
[00:52:30]  Oh, come on.  No.  Come on.  Please do that.  Please do that.  Because we'll ask him.  Okay.  He's going to fall right into our trap.  Of course.  We will ask him about that.  And he will go, that was an ad-lib.  And then Jimmy can.  Can I ask the margarita question?  Oh, yeah.  Please do.  Please do.  Let's see what else is going on.  I have so much to ask him.  I don't even fucking.  All right.  Ad-lib.  I mean, we're doing.  Scrambling. 
[00:53:00]  You know, you're on camera.  The guy says smile into the lens.  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on a second.  So, wait.  The guy says smile.  So, you know you're going to smile.  But isn't there a little part of you that knows there's something else I could do there?  Go.  He does the finger.  What are you doing?  You know.  What was that?  What was the deal?  Oh, my God.  That was the deal.  How did they not make a movie about that moment?  More than just a point.  The day I pointed. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Changed my life.  Yeah.  Poor Ted.  That takes off.  Exactly.  You know, everything else, all my other little things that I was doing as an actor for the  character, zip.  And then the...  The finger thing takes off.  Did you have a lot of fun on there?  I had a lot of fun.  A lot of beautiful women, a lot of famous movie stars.  Wow.  People I never thought I would meet, I got to meet.  Name them.  Ginger Rogers came up to me and told me what a wonderful actor I was.  Wow.  I bought Gene Kelly a drink in Hong Kong. 
[00:54:00]  Pause.  You know what I mean?  I sat up and...  We now know where Sal got the info for the one sheet.  All of Sal's info came from this horrible interview.  Right.  This guy's casino interview.  Casino interview.  Ted Lang.  Ted Langy.  Rewind.  This guy didn't respond properly to that.  No?  Yeah, no.  Rewind.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Just a little bit to the Ginger Rogers thing.  Okay.  Okay.  Ginger Rogers came up to me and told me what a wonderful actor I was.  What the fuck was she supposed to say, Ted? 
[00:54:30]  A wonderful actor?  A wonderful...  What?  I mean, look.  Slowed out.  He was on a love boat.  Yeah.  Slowed out a little bit.  People liked him on that.  Probably bought her a drink.  Yeah.  Seems nice enough.  Nice enough.  All right.  I bought Gene Kelly a drink in Hong Kong.  You know what I mean?  I sat up and talked about acting with Lloyd Bridges.  It just goes on and on.  Keep telling me more and more and more. 
[00:55:00]  Mendel bomb.  Ralph Bellamy taught me how to use camera.  So it was like...  It was an education.  It was a wonderful time to be an actor.  Sure.  You know, because you're learning from the old pros.  And we were watching people like Lonnie Anderson coming up.  John Ritter was coming up.  Lonnie?  Oh, my...  Lonnie, did she have a black eye?  Because I heard Bert was batting her around.  Bert used to fucking belt her in the face.  Yeah.  I heard that she would have a little knuckle sandwich before she came. 
[00:55:30]  Ted, right or wrong?  Elbow, elbow.  Elbow.  Come on, Ted.  I heard that, man.  I heard Bert straighten that lippy bitch right out.  Bert's fist cruising into her eyes, see?  Tie in the whole boat thing.  That's right.  You did the whole point thing.  He did the whole point thing with his fist right to her eye socket.  Right or wrong, Ted?  Right or wrong, Ted.  Comment.  Ted, comment.  What do you got on that?  Point.  Yeah.  Point.  When he points, I'm going to go, holy shit, you're the dynamite guy. 
[00:56:00]  I'm going to do that one, too.  Hold on.  All right.  Go ahead, Sam.  All right.  All of the young and up-and-coming stars, Tom Hanks, Martin Short, all those guys came  through.  Lorenzo Lamas.  Lorenzo Lamas.  Right.  On their way to doing their deal.  Yeah.  Tell me about Zsa Zsa Gabor.  Zsa Zsa Gabor was a wonderful...  Speaking of bore.  ...a lot of fun.  The one that was in it was her sister...  Of course she was in it.  Let me ask him a question, though, Ted.  Was this before or after she began having parts lopped off and thrown in the hamper? 
[00:56:30]  I understand she's down to an ankle and two nose hairs.  Ted, what do you got on that?  Still alive.  Oh, man.  Unbelievable.  She really is.  She's fucking the hand from the Addams Family.  She's going to be buried in a hat box.  She's playing Thing.  Yeah, she's Thing.  They just, you know, ask her a question.  She snaps out of her thoughts.  Oh, yeah.  Ava Gabor, Green Acres, Ava Gabor was really nasty, but she pretended like she didn't know 
[00:57:00]  what she was saying when she was being really nasty.  But she would say, double entendres came out of Ava Gabor.  Wait, Zsa Zsa is the one that's falling apart.  Oh, man.  She's gorgeous.  She was stuck.  Ava's the sister.  She was on Green Acres.  That'll be good fodder.  Right.  Tell me about Zsa Zsa.  No, no, no.  He asked about Zsa Zsa and he's talking about Ava.  The interviewer asked about Zsa Zsa.  I already know what I'd ask.  Go back a little bit.  See, we missed something here.  We did.  Yes, watch.  All right.  What topic do you want me to tackle?  Right when she said, he said she's really nasty. 
[00:57:30]  Oh.  Oh, okay, cool.  But she would say, double entendres.  We won.  Oh, boy.  Samuel.  No, you're right.  Samuel, you bum.  You're right.  Or was really nasty.  Oh, no.  She N-word a lot, huh?  I've heard that about her.  Tremendous racist.  You mean.  But she pretended like she didn't know what she was saying when she was being really nasty.  But she would say, double entendres came out of Ava Gabor. 
[00:58:00]  No kidding.  Oh, man.  And she's gorgeous.  She was stunningly beautiful.  She was all right.  She was stunningly beautiful.  And she'd say these nasty little things to you.  Like what?  And you go.  Yeah.  And then she'd smile and walk away.  The Rat Pack.  Any of the guys in the Rat Pack on the show?  No, but Junior was on the show.  Any of the guys from the Rat Pack on the show?  The guy does sound like Kenison.  Yeah.  Hopefully he has the same driving habits. 
[00:58:30]  Sammy and Dean Martin?  Nobody.  Sammy wanted to do the show.  And I would bump into him periodically.  White's only boat.  And he was always talking about who was going to be on the show.  And of course, Sammy was bumped into you.  You didn't bump into him.  It was the one side every time you turned a corner.  You had a blind sign, Ted.  Sammy would bump into me.  And he'd say, move it, man.  Get out of my way.  I wanted to do an episode where he was chained in the bilge.  Wow.  Right. 
[00:59:00]  They didn't.  He's dead.  Yeah, I see.  He did nothing but contribute and entertain.  Yes.  Sammy.  No.  He wanted to do the show badly.  And he was good friends with Aaron.  But something had gone down and then they made up and they became friends again.  What went down, Ted?  He was always doing 10 million things.  I know what happened, Ted.  This is a classic story at a party where Aaron took out Sammy's glass eye and rolled it like a marble and said, 
[00:59:30]  Now go get it.  And then used a really nasty word.  Classic story.  Pick your stinky, stinky fake eye up off the rug, you.  And then used a bad word.  10 million things.  So he never got around to it.  Never got around to it.  Well, Thunder Valley, thank you.  We're going to take this out.  I'm going to let you do your finger thing, okay?  Your finger thing.  Diddles his bunghole with it.  Exactly.  Put the other one in his pistol.  I'm in Thunder Valley. 
[01:00:00]  Jesus, that guy don't play.  No.  All right.  He's opening the door with his fucking head.  He's hitting all the media destinations.  Yeah.  Thunder Valley.  When was that interview done?  2011.  Well, good thing it's there.  So, you know, Sal could get all the info.  No kidding.  We're only just over two hours away from Ted Lang.  Oh, my gosh.  I'll say good for Sal, though, for actually watching an interview and getting some information.  I say good job, I said.  I'm going Ted Lang.  Fuck it.  There's a 42-minute interview.  That's okay, Sam.  That's all right. 
[01:00:30]  What about the...  I want to see what he does on the new show, though.  I'm looking for a solid two.  Yeah.  Watch the 42-minute interview be really different.  Yeah.  Like, so Ted, you were brought up on rape charges.  Damn motherfucking write-up.  It's just a crazy interview.  Meet you, Cock, who's on MSNBC this morning.  Ah.  Yeah.  He has officially blown us off.  No, we didn't try to get him, did we?  I don't know.  I think we should always get him.  Future of the mind.  String theory.  It says that your shoe is tied.  Picture your shoelaces.  Like little cookie people.  Right.  Cookie people. 
[01:01:00]  Remember when Neil Tyson was in here?  Neil the Great.  Yeah.  How great that is.  He was amazing.  Because he was so much smarter than we were, but he explained it in a way that wasn't totally  retarded.  Not like a ridiculous...  We've got to get him back.  Yeah, he's coming back.  Michu Kaku.  Michu.  Opie from Opie and Anthony.  Ah.  Oh, hey.  Hey.  Just wanted to say hi.  I mean, it did our show a bunch, I thought.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I thought I could say hi without you running away scared.  Hi, I've interviewed you and I live in the building.  Ah!  Who are you?  I've never seen her talk to you before on media. 
[01:01:30]  Scaredy cat.  Jesus Christ, you skittish.  He's only 25 years old, you know.  Oh, he looks like a lot.  His hair's white.  That's grass.  His hair's white.  Yeah.  Petrified.  Scared all the time.  Always petrified.  Oh, he's a frightened man.  And walks really fast out there on the streets.  Extremely fast.  Uh, so, I have an amazing bit of trivia, by the way.  You do?  Amazing.  Yeah.  I didn't think, I thought it was crap until I looked it up.  Someone on Twitter put me on to this.  Let me hear it.  We were talking about Ted Bundy. 
[01:02:00]  Mm-hmm.  Blondie, Deborah Harry, got in the car with him in New York.  No.  And thought he was going to, uh, and got out in the early 70s.  Wow.  How do you know that's true?  Because I looked it up online and it's her story.  Blondie's Debbie Harry claimed serial killer Ted Bundy lured her in the car.  And she said, uh, uh, the photo of an interview, she told how Bundy spotted her from his car  in the early morning hours as she walked across town in New York.  He, uh, persisted in offering her a lift. 
[01:02:30]  And because there were no cabs available, she finally got in the small car.  Her instinct, however, saved her life.  Because she noticed there were no door handles and the car interior was stripped bare.  Wow.  She somehow managed to put her hand through the window, because I guess it was cracked, she said,  and opened the door from the outside and jumped from the moving vehicle.  Damn.  She only learned later that the smelly driver, because she said he smelled terrible, was Ted Bundy.  Um, and after his arrest, Bundy said he made his first attempt to kidnap a woman in 69  and implied that he committed his first actual murder in 72. 
[01:03:00]  Damn.  Bundy earlier, okay.  So, yeah.  Jesus.  That was some thank you to the listener for putting me up on that.  I had no idea.  Yeah.  Wouldn't have had all those wonderful, uh, songs.  But isn't it weird how you think, like, one, one guy's actions could have affected me?  Yeah.  Fuck.  Right.  Damn.  Call me.  Yeah.  Do we have any audio of Ted Lang on his new show?  Oh, yeah.  He dyed his hair, by the way, back to the love boat, uh, days.  Yeah.  If you want to pick it up right here.  Pick it up. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, Ted Lang just said something funny?  Don't you like to see the wizard or something?  Ted.  Yes, sir.  What do you think, man?  If you go to a dance, look at the black men that are watching the white guy dance, and  they're all going like this.  Shaking their heads.  Yeah.  I like that.  A little racial humor.  All right, ladies.  You got some good advice.  Locking your choice.  Show me what you got.  Ugh.  All right.  Yeah, apparently it's a show about the differences between black people and white people. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, yeah?  Is it really?  It's part of it.  Oh.  Cool.  All right.  So we'll have Ted from the love boat.  Ted Lang.  Lange.  Whatever.  Ted Lang.  That guy's in my head.  Lange.  You know what Joe Biden said, speaking about that?  What did Joe Biden say?  About black people and white people?  Uh-oh.  What?  He said, uh, I may be a white boy, but I can jump.  Oh, yeah?  That's a little movie play.  Uh-huh.  What's wrong with that?  Everybody's...  Well, that's a very stupid thing for the vice president to say. 
[01:04:30]  Not really.  I don't care.  How was he second guest, by the way, on the fucking show?  Amy Poehler was the lead guest and he was second?  Or is Amy his co-hosting that night?  What on the Seth...  On Seth Rahn, Seth Meyers.  Seth Meyers.  Seth Meyers did very well in the ratings, by the way.  He wanted Amy to be his first guest.  Oh.  How do you have Joe Biden be second?  I mean, all due respect to Amy Poehler.  How do you tell the vice president, like, look, they're friends.  Yeah, you'll be second.  The vice president is a figurehead.  It's Lorne Michaels, I'm sure.  All right, we'll play the Joe Biden clip after the break. 
[01:05:00]  We got the song parody from Todd.  Oh, my God.  We got Elijah Ward coming in.  That's a good one.  Yeah.  We got lots to do today.  Oh, yeah.  Three, two...  Go with Lange?  I don't know.  If you go with Lange, I gotta go with Lange.  We gotta go with Lange.  Good cop, bad cop.  And we got Elijah Ward coming in.  A little limones.  By the way, I have to correct myself.  Harley Snopes is saying that Debbie Harry's story was false.  Not that she lied, but that she was mistaken.  There's been a lot of reports of women who had weird things with guys that they later thought 
[01:05:30]  was Ted Bundy.  Apparently Ted was never in New York.  Really?  Okay, yeah, that was it.  Wait, so that did happen to Debbie Harry, but with somebody else.  Yeah, they think it was just somebody else.  She might have been a little drunk, and then went, oh, yeah, that guy looks familiar.  Ah, yeah.  Uh-huh.  Gotcha.  Very cool.  So, oh, he was never in New York?  I didn't know that.  No, it said the closest he ever got to New York was Philly.  Really?  Okay.  How do you know that much?  I was reading it while I was fucking taking a dimp.  Now everybody just reads on the bowl.  Absolutely.  You wind up spending a lot more time in there than you used to. 
[01:06:00]  It had hemorrhoids like wind chimes.  Wind chimes.  How do you come up with this stuff, Jimmy?  Oh, my God.  The Ted, the Todd, the Ted show.  Jesus.  The Todd show.  The Todd show is went up to day three.  Yes.  Yeah.  We're obsessed with this because this is everything that's wrong with regular radio.  Yeah.  A world we had to leave. 
[01:06:30]  Yes.  We had to leave it.  We were asked to leave and not to return.  We probably could have made it back there by now, but they just handcuff everybody and  it's just horrendous, horrendous shit.  So supposedly Todd, you know, has got this brand new show with a, going to reclaim FM radio  and blah, blah, blah, blah, and it's all the same garbage.  I think his mission statement is he's going to reinvent the whole fucking thing.  Reinvent the whole thing with phony phone calls. 
[01:07:00]  By going local.  Yeah, going local and song parodies.  No one gives a fuck about local anymore.  No one cares.  No, no one cares.  We've really become a global world.  And not even just in radio anymore.  It doesn't matter anymore.  Right.  Everything.  Local doesn't matter.  It really doesn't matter.  And for the people, I'm sure, even our fan base, they'll probably tune into their local  station quickly maybe for just a few minutes, maybe for a traffic report or just maybe a  quick headlines from their city.  But after that, they're done and they're back to, you know, finding entertainment. 
[01:07:30]  Right.  It doesn't matter if it's local entertainment or on a national level.  Mm-hmm.  These idiots that go, we're going to focus on the fact that we're a local.  We're a local.  It's not going to work if CNN doesn't.  Right.  Let everybody else concentrate on national.  Right.  We're a local show.  It doesn't fucking matter in the end.  It just doesn't.  Maybe a few years ago, maybe.  But now we're all just used to it.  Yeah.  So, the Todd Show did a song parody. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, God.  More shoehorning, I bet.  I used to be a strength-laced, respectable guy, but it got me nowhere.  I don't know what he said.  I don't even know what he said.  Oh, my God.  That was the worst.  What did he say there, though?  I don't know.  The shoehorning is right from the start.  He's the worst offender of that I've ever heard in a song parody. 
[01:08:30]  What was he trying to say?  Ah, you're stupid.  I got to be tough.  Young, hip fucking comedy, that is.  Young, fun stuff.  Yeah.  Isn't that a show tune?  I used to be a strength-laced, respectable guy, but it got me nowhere, so now I don't care.  Out on the town every night, I rarely go home alone.  Ugh.  I walk up to a bar with my shirt and buttons, and I do what I please, drink martinis. 
[01:09:00]  Until I find the lady, then I drop into my soul.  I give her my best pick-up line.  I ask her what's her sign.  I can't follow this.  Oh, my God.  Who?  I can't follow this.  Who laughs at this?  Yeah. 
[01:09:30]  First of all, the song itself is done horribly.  We all know that, technically.  He's an awful song parody writer.  And then the content of it is about, he's talking about martinis and picking up girls in bars.  Who the fuck does that in this day and age?  Is that how young?  Yeah, very young and hip-sounding.  No one goes to bars to pick up girls and drink martinis.  By the time you get to the bar, you already know.  You already have seen 20,000 naked pictures of each other. 
[01:10:00]  You beat off to each other.  What the fuck?  Beat off.  Beat off.  You already know the shade of brown of her asshole.  Right, right, exactly.  You know how brown her asshole is.  It's fucking ridiculous.  Boy, have times changed.  How funny is this picture for the Todd show?  Oh, it's the best.  Oh, shit.  They're going to have to come up with a new hashtag, I'm thinking.  You think that they noticed that it's been hijacked?  Oh, boy, have they noticed. 
[01:10:30]  Well, let's get back to this.  Oh.  A line.  I ask her what's her sign.  What's her sign?  Then moving for the kill.  I prepare to drill.  Every night I need a new thrill.  Because I'm on the edge of horny.  And there ain't no one that I won't do.  What?  The edge of horny instead of glory?  That's why the laughs in the back are happening?  No, I think he wants to say horny, but he's not allowed to say horny on the radio. 
[01:11:00]  I don't know.  I'm on the edge of horny, right?  Horny rhymes.  What's horny, though?  It's a girl almost being horny, or I don't know.  Oh, horny, horny.  I'm acting almost horny.  Oh, horny.  Okay, yeah, duh.  But then there's this big laughter in the background.  Can you hear the tentative?  They were on the radio titters in the back.  Oh, horny.  You see this Twitter account?  This is Todd Sheckler.  It's a picture of Todd.  He has poorly painted mustache on.  The edge of horny. 
[01:11:30]  And there ain't no one that I won't do.  I'm on the edge of horny.  I'll jump on you like a kangaroo.  I like the blonde.  The blonde.  Brunette.  Brunette.  Redhead.  Redhead.  It's my bed.  Because I'm on the edge of horny.  Looking for somebody new to do.  I'm a self-proclaimed sex guru. 
[01:12:00]  Come and listen.  They're so funny.  Love you guys.  This is the Todd Show.  Holy shit.  They're not so funny.  What hack?  Wow.  What was the sound?  Let's go.  Oh, yeah.  It's just fucking full of electronic noises.  What was that?  That's what we always make fun of.  Yeah.  We're the other guy.  I'm a self-proclaimed sex guru.  Come and listen.  They're so funny.  Love you guys.  This is the Todd Show. 
[01:12:30]  He was using his little voice, too, there, a little bit.  I'm on the edge of horny.  I'm on the edge of horny.  Irock, that was terrible.  Irock?  Yeah, what are you doing, Irock?  You were friendly with me.  He's got something in his hand.  I bet it's pizza.  Now, I told Eric that we can't just continue playing the Todd Show clips unless you've got  something really good.  Really good.  Well, Eric doesn't know he made fun of them.  He's just enjoying listening.  Yes, yes. 
[01:13:00]  It's his brand of radio.  Yes.  Well, I have something if you had nothing else to go to.  You don't have to if you don't want to.  What is it?  I see what it says.  What do you think?  We can't do another phone scan.  Oh, my God.  He didn't do another phone scan.  I hear he's doing four a day.  No, he has to do four a day.  All right.  Four a day?  I'll be back.  The voice is probably different, though, right?  Well, this one, he actually says a name, because the last few didn't have any names in it.  Is it a good name?  Don't tell me what it is.  I won't.  We've got to hear the name. 
[01:13:30]  Okay, all right.  We've got to hear the name.  At least the name.  Fucking stinks.  Well, he was the one who said he's going to reinvent radio.  The Todd Show.  As he does the same horse shit he did with Scott and Todd.  That's terrible.  What?  Yeah, that's not nice.  All right.  Phone scam time on The Todd Show.  Who's this guy?  This is kind of an interesting story.  I need dance lessons.  And my boss is having this big thing.  Well, you'll hear about it.  It's called the big toy.  Yes, he is. 
[01:14:00]  What?  A big toy.  Hey, this is left McFootie.  I got two left McFeets, and I'm trying to dance.  I bet it's worse.  Nah.  You'll hear about it.  It's called the big toy.  Get the fake voice on there.  Hello, Dance Academy.  How can I help you?  Yeah, my name is...  God!  And no one starts a phone call with, my name is.  Yeah.  When have you ever called for pizza? 
[01:14:30]  Hey, it's John's Pizzeria.  Yeah, my name is Slice-A-Pie Pizza Magoodle.  Oh, that's a funny way to start.  It certainly is.  My name is...  I can't wait for the name.  But he's reinventing radio games.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Reinvent.  Hello, Dance Academy.  How can I help you?  Yeah, my name is Ishmins Nevlumchen.  I'm from Brighton Beach, and I need to get me some twerking lessons on account of my jerk-off 
[01:15:00]  boss is having a twerk-off competition.  Ishmins Nevlumchen.  Yeah, my jerk-off boss over there.  Jerky boy's rip-off.  Yeah.  I can't do the original voice or thought.  Hi, my name is Steely McPersona.  I'd like to take something that worked many years ago, and then just kind of claim it  as my own.  He is really fucking ripping off the Frank Rizzo.  Oh, my God.  And then I gotta win it, or he's gonna bag me.  Oh, um, I'm really sorry. 
[01:15:30]  I don't know if we'll be able to help you.  Unfortunately, we don't provide, uh...  You know what?  You know, the economy is bad, right?  Don't close the door to new business, then.  I mean, I'm gonna have a tough time with this.  When I was a kid, I was bitten by a snake, and the venom froze up all my...  I'm sorry about that, but we are a professional dance company.  We don't have anyone to teach, um, the twerking.  We don't really consider that dance.  Yeah, well, let's get to it in a second, but what do you mean you don't consider it dance? 
[01:16:00]  I mean, I'm gonna come in there like a wrecking ball and make it happen.  You get the pop culture reference?  We will teach ballet and jazz, uh, all, all dance, professional dance that, uh, you know,  ballerinas can get into companies for, get my students into good college programs, things like that.  Let me ask, what was your name, Marissa?  Oh, no, no, no, my name is Gianna.  Yeah, I can't say G's.  But you just said the letter G.  Right, but I'm talking about it in the context of someone's name.  Like, I can say G. Who the hell can't say G? 
[01:16:30]  I'm just saying, if it's part of the name, then, like, if I go to say your name, I say Yadda.  I'm out. I can't do it.  Well, moving forward, how about you can just call me Miss G?  Tap it out.  I can't do it.  It's just...  It's fucking enraging and terrible.  It's not even fun.  No, it's so bad.  He's doing four of those a day, but he's reinventing radio.  Yeah.  He rotates them now, too.  Like, a new one will play twice that day, and then once the next day at a different time.  Get rid of the old guy, because you're young and fresh, right? 
[01:17:00]  That's the big youth movement.  Every hour is a different audience, so...  Talking about being in a bar and asking, girl, what's your sign?  What is this, Ronan Martin's laughing?  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  My head pops out of a box.  My name is Izzy McFunny name.  Suck it to me.  What else is he doing on the show?  You've been kind of unlistening?  He throws it to those girls all the time.  I would rather hear them.  He chimes in a little bit here and there.  I would, too, like multiple Migs. 
[01:17:30]  Thank you.  Like, he'll sit there and go, yeah, they'll read a story, they'll read what's trending,  they'll read anything else that's going on in New York.  They were talking about the St. Patrick's Day parade, and again, how gays.  They can't march in a parade.  Big story here in New York.  Local.  Keep it up.  Are they still not letting gays march in a fucking parade?  Apparently.  Without banners.  They're not allowing with banners.  They're not allowing gay groups to march in the parade holding a gay banner. 
[01:18:00]  Fuck St. Patrick's Day parade.  So what happens is now, I guess the mayor's not marching, and then all the city council  isn't marching, and yeah, they're not allowing any city employees to march.  Well, they shouldn't ban them from marching.  It should be a choice.  You can't ban them from marching.  Well, they can, and they did.  That's ridiculous.  That's wrong.  Yeah.  But the thing is, the St. Patrick's Day parade is, it's, you know, the Irish thing, but it's  also a Catholic. 
[01:18:30]  Fuck them.  Attribute to one of their saints.  So, again, the gay and the Catholic thing, clashing.  They don't want to have their morality must-seed up with some gayness.  So, basically, gays are allowed to use the road that's tied up, right?  Or can gays not, can gays cross the road?  Or, oh, that's right.  To get to the other side.  They have to be in-  To get to the fist on the other side.  Yeah.  Because it was inside the chicken.  No, but I guess they have to stop because the parade's going through and be inconvenienced,  right?  Right.  They can't, right.  Got it.  Fuck St. Patrick's Day parade. 
[01:19:00]  Fuck them.  It's a, it's a, it's like a religious thing.  I guess Donahue, um, what's his name, uh, Bill Donahue was talking about it this morning.  Uh, the fact that it's a, you know, it's a Catholic saint.  And, again, those gays and Catholics, oh boy, do they butt heads.  Show molested children.  And how about you call around a bunch of boys' assholes propped up and say, this is  what we've supported.  How about you do that?  How about you?  Fuck you.  Let's say hi to Pat in Buffalo, who's going to speak for many, many people calling with  the same exact thing. 
[01:19:30]  Hello, Pat.  Go ahead, Pat.  Yes, uh, my wonderful radio ear has detected that I'm pretty sure the girl that answers  the phone at the alleged dance studio is the same one that ordered the, the cupcakes that  did not want paleo cupcakes the other day.  Can we get, can we get the cupcake phone call?  Yeah, let me go pieces together.  Well, we all know the, side by side, yeah.  You, you know by now that prank calls are, are not allowed on the radio anymore.  We used to love doing them, man.  We had fun doing them.  We had a, we had a few hits.  Oh, no.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:20:00]  Jimmy read something.  The Todd Show hashtag.  Yeah, somebody wrote the, uh, I wish the snake that bit him was Robert Reed's venomous  trap.  Thank you, Jesus.  The deadly Robert Reed trouser snake.  Yes.  Go get the cupcake phone call.  Let's, let's match it up.  Right.  And then, of course, now they have to have the disclaimer at the end of the fake prank 
[01:20:30]  call.  Oh, is that at the end?  Yeah.  But that disclaimer is not a legitimate legal disclaimer.  No.  I think they're putting it on to make it seem like, look, we're doing real prank phone  calls, but he uses an acting service.  Yeah.  Yeah.  None of his calls, because there's other people who do prank calls in this industry that have  to go through a lot more shit than Todd does.  Uh-huh.  And they've all said that they have, that Todd uses a service, because he never had to have  a disclaimer.  Everything's so poorly and heavily edited, you know, and a lot of the way, like.  Yeah, but the disclaimer says they're actors, they're professional, uh, pranksters or 
[01:21:00]  something like that.  No, the disclaimers will say, like, um, they'll use a real situation where a wife wants to set  up a husband, they'll get the wife on the phone, they call the husband, blah, blah, blah,  blah, blah, blah.  But the, the, uh, the releases and the legal disclaimer saying that, you know, the parties  were involved and signed off on this.  Mm-hmm.  They'll do the call, but they can't air it until everyone says, okay, they give permission.  But why do they have to say that?  Like, what's the use of saying that if they're just doing a show?  No, these are fake, these are fake phone calls.  They're fake. 
[01:21:30]  They're fake, right.  But he's paying for, like, an actor or a service, so it's not a legitimate prank phone  call.  Uh-huh.  You're not calling a private citizen.  Nope.  So he doesn't have to disclaim it.  Oh, that's why they're saying a professional prankster or something.  Right, yeah, yeah.  But they're not saying who the prankster is.  But if you hear these disclaimers at the end, it's meant to sound like they're doing a legal  disclaimer, but they're goofing on it.  Right.  Mm-hmm.  None of it is saying that, you know, all parties.  They're not goofing on it.  They're not goofing on it, no.  That's the worst thing you could do after a prank call is have any type of disclaimer.  That's horrible.  But it's not saying that all parties involved signed off on it.  It doesn't matter, but you're just making people, you know, realize that there's something 
[01:22:00]  going on.  The lawyers probably said, no, you've got to say something because then people start  doing it and they blame them.  I get it.  There's no way they're being ironic.  He stinks too much to be ironic.  Right.  Their legal disclaimers do not flat out tell you that it's a fake call and that everyone  involved with it gave their permission.  They're mocking it.  They're not mocking it.  Let's go to Carolyn, or is it Caroline?  Very funny.  Brian Regan. 
[01:22:30]  Carolyn.  Yeah, you're sick of hearing that one.  And we are very sensitive to how our names are said.  He's totally right.  All right.  So it's Carolyn.  Yeah, I got the first letter right.  I got a couple I could throw after that.  Hey, what's your name?  This is Carolyn McBrien.  Thank you very much.  What do you got there?  I was going to say that, you know, I'm 40 years old and I have female friends.  Hang up.  Just stop.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  We called 20 years too late.  Yeah, what are you doing? 
[01:23:00]  Go ahead.  Sorry.  No, it's okay.  It's fine.  And I have female friends that listen to the Todd show.  And you guys know this better than I do, but I'm convinced his audience are middle-aged  women who don't get your sense of humor.  They're not cutting edge.  Absolutely.  They're not witty.  They're not.  They don't.  They're pathetic is what you're saying.  We're not expecting all middle-aged women to listen to the Opie and Anthony show, but  I think regular radio could offer a better product is what I'm getting at. 
[01:23:30]  We understand people have different senses of humor, but what we're listening to is  horrendously bad.  And I have to give the women more credit out there that they want something better than  a horrible song parody or a horrible prank, a fake prank call.  Don't give them more credit.  Then that's just downright sad.  Well, it's not just women too, because I mean, I work in an office with a bunch of accountants  and boring people.  Getting coffee for them, aren't you?  I am.  Yes.  Very funny. 
[01:24:00]  On my knees.  Thank you.  Oh, nice.  Oh, she goes with it.  Nice.  She goes with it.  Arthritic knees.  She goes to 40.  How's that menopause treating you?  Hot flashes.  Are you done?  Yeah.  Every time you stop talking, I hear your eggs drying up.  Jesus.  That's being nice.  I know.  I love you guys.  Thank you, miss.  It's cruel, but I knew what I was going to get.  No, we don't mean that.  No, well.  Her womb looks like one of those lunch bags you send your kids off to school with. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, crinkly.  I don't have kids, so I look a little...  All right.  Nice.  And a girl.  There you go.  You saved that body.  Yeah.  How does it look?  Pretty good?  I'm allergic to children.  I can't...  Yeah.  Oh, boy, you poor girl.  I hear you.  Maybe someday, though.  No.  I have no...  No, that's pretty much...  That ship has sailed.  I'm not...  No, it hasn't...  I'm not looking for the next 18 years of prison.  I don't know about that.  That's pretty good.  How'd you keep from getting pregnant for so long?  Oop.  I'm married for 15 years.  What?  I don't want kids. 
[01:25:00]  It's...  Not every woman wants kids.  What happened to you when you were growing up that you don't want to have kids?  I was raped.  No, I'm kidding.  That's pretty good, though.  Yeah, you should have let that sit there for a minute.  Sexy and funny.  Let that sit there for a second before you had the big reveal.  I don't want to do this.  What do you do?  You take your glasses off and take your hair down and shake it in slow motion?  Exactly.  Being all sexy?  Yeah.  How do you look?  You good?  I think I'm okay, yeah.  Good shape?  I mean, everyone says that. 
[01:25:30]  Good shape, yeah.  Yeah.  I'm not overweight.  How's that ace?  That ace.  Well, that sounds good.  You got a cute voice.  Doesn't sound like it's been riddled by cigarettes like many women.  I'm 40 years young.  I don't have children.  I am very clean.  I think that's why I look a little bit younger than I am.  That's nice. 
[01:26:00]  Shaved?  Shaved down there?  Oh, yeah.  What do you do?  What do you do?  I wish there was more women than...  What does a 40-year-old woman do?  You shave it a bit?  What does a 40-year-old woman do with her nest down there?  Yeah.  What do you do?  Is it shaved?  When I was 25, I lasered it permanently.  Oh, my God.  How do you know what the trend is going to be, though?  Good girl.  When you work in Manhattan, you live in Manhattan, you do cutting-edge stuff, and I never wanted  to deal with it again.  It was a lot of money, but it was the best...  What if the trend comes back for Bush, and I think it is, to tell you the truth.  I'm going on record as saying hair between a woman's fucking legs that's making a big comeback. 
[01:26:30]  It's making a comeback.  But it will never be social big comeback that'll be a turnoff to see bald.  It makes a big comeback, because you don't have to put, like, bell-bottoms, but you don't  put your nose in bell-bottoms and have to go, pop, pop, and have to be wearing bell-bottoms.  That's part of the whole thing.  Right.  Let me come back...  It's like spitting out watermelon seeds.  You still enjoy the watermelon.  That's true, but if you had an option for seedless watermelon, you'd never one day go, 
[01:27:00]  I enjoyed spitting out those disgusting, stinky seeds.  Disgusting, stinky...  I don't know.  It can come back all at once.  I am perfectly happy with it.  Yeah?  You got a little lasered off?  Not legs, everything.  No, and it works?  Oh, yeah, totally.  That sounds dangerous.  That's great.  It's painful.  It's very painful.  Oh, all right.  It's worth it.  Well, thanks for your insight on it. 
[01:27:30]  Really?  Middle-aged women.  I like that.  Christ, I can't believe that's all I can contribute to the show.  That's all you can contribute.  Very good, though.  Unless you get in the kitchen or the bedroom.  That's all you can contribute.  Don't say it, James.  Kitchen on the bedroom, Florida.  I love you guys.  Thank you very much.  We love you.  Thank you, Caroline.  By Caroline Line.  Caroline.  Caroline Line.  It was Caroline on that one.  Yeah.  So, where were we?  Lasered off.  Oh, some people are saying that it's the same voice on two separate separate calls. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, yeah.  We want to hear.  We're going to have to do it side by side.  Eric should have had it by now, no?  John in Boston.  John.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, you guys know how bad you fucked with Scott sharing.  He's probably so happy you're fucking with him with the Todd show.  Oh, yeah.  It probably changed overnight.  Well, he's not going to be so happy on Monday when his solo show starts.  We're obsessed with this.  Yes.  We got it.  We'll admit it.  We're completely obsessed. 
[01:28:30]  Because Scott and Todd were the stars of Jocktober, and now they have split up to do separate  shows, and they're both going to be god-awful.  It's like when your parents get a divorce.  You get two Christmas presents.  Right.  From, you know, two Christmases from each parent.  So, this is like two Christmases from Jocktober.  Wonderful gifts.  All right.  Let's find some Todd catchphrases.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  Maybe we'll stick to them.  You stick to what you do.  We can do the 911 call while E-Rock gets the prank calls together. 
[01:29:00]  Is there a new fun 911 call?  What's it about?  There sure is.  He called 911.  Hypothermia was hitting it.  You haven't heard of this one yet?  No.  What is it?  This is terrific.  Is it a funny one or a sad one?  Bit on the sexy side?  Sexy.  See that latest girl that fucking got arrested, a teacher, having sex with a student?  No.  She was fucking smoking.  You know, I knew she was smoking just because she didn't get a sentence. 
[01:29:30]  Nothing.  I heard the story on the way in, and I'm like, okay, she's hot.  I had no doubt that she was hot.  Let me take a look at her.  Yeah, if we could find her.  Was that a Long Island one?  I'm not sure if it was Long Island or not.  I thought it was a Long Island story.  Some teacher.  Was that the Ridge story?  A student.  At a Ridge?  I'm not sure.  Or teacher, student.  Riverhead area.  That's a dude.  Long Island teacher.  Oh, see?  That's a different one.  Long Island teacher.  Why was he? 
[01:30:00]  Oh, he was acquitted of rape.  He was with some girl.  She was 16.  Right.  And with her until she turned 17.  Right.  New York, age of consent to 17.  But he did get a contributing to the delinquency of a minor or some shit like that.  But he didn't get the rape charge.  Okay.  Which is odd since she was 16 at the time.  I think I got the story here.  But there's another story.  Oh, here we go.  California.  Is it California?  There she is, right?  California.  No, that's not her.  Who's that chick right there? 
[01:30:30]  I think that's her.  Wait.  Guilty?  What do you mean?  This one's cute, too.  Yeah, but...  How many are there?  That one has big shoulders up.  Yeah, she's a big neck lady.  That one's...  What was just a headshot?  In Houston.  How old is the students?  16.  Yeah.  She's 25.  And what happened?  Someone fucking opened their dumb mouth?  Did this always go on?  Maybe we're just getting older, but I never fucking knew this happened.  This was like lotto, though.  You don't know people that won lotto.  You hear about it.  This fucking shit is amazing. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, but I've never had fucking one person win two lotto tickets in a row.  Yeah, that's true.  You know, in the fucking parking lot.  In our day and age, people just knew how to shut the fuck up.  Right.  Kept their yaps shut.  Right.  They kept their yaps shut.  No social media, so it made it harder for it to spread around.  Wow, she's beautiful.  She's cute, man.  Of course she didn't get any time.  Yeah.  So what did she do?  Sex with a 16-year-old, I guess.  One of her charges.  Yeah, she got 10 years probation and a $5,000 fine. 
[01:31:30]  How come she got probation instead of jail time?  Like a lot of the women we've seen get jail time.  They don't quite look like her.  I think the judge said it was that ass.  That ass.  Yeah.  And those tits.  The judge said that ass, though.  Yeah.  Do the bit yourself.  We did it a while ago.  It's true.  The uglier the teacher, the more time she gets.  More time.  Period.  They consider it abuse at that point.  Yes.  Fucking ah.  That's a poor child. 
[01:32:00]  The judge just understands.  The judge understands.  He's looking down from that bench going, oh, I understand.  It's like that kid had to have loved it.  Right.  With this girl.  Oh, boy.  She was a honey.  You know what they said to the parents of that kid who got fired?  Get over it.  Ah, yeah.  Ah, yeah.  All right.  The 911 call.  What is it?  It's good.  It's good.  All right.  Woman calls 911.  But there wasn't an emergency.  Not quite an emergency? 
[01:32:30]  No.  Well, she's in Dutch.  Mediate.  Thank you.  Mediate.  Not exactly an emergency.  A punigod of woman's accused of calling 911 drunk and looking for sex.  Tonight, NBC2's Laura Roberts talks to the woman's neighbors.  They say they're not surprised.  Uh-oh.  On the phone all day, every day, dispatchers hear it all.  But one calling to the Punta Gorda Police Department Friday afternoon was surprising even to the professionals.  911, where is your emergency? 
[01:33:00]  That's the emergency.  Did you ask a question?  Police say Maria Montanis-Helor made the call for a question about a Corvette.  Police responded to her home on Almar Drive.  They say it was clear she'd been drinking.  I'm assuming the alcohol, you know, forced her to, or coerced her to call 911 and ask her questions.  Questions that became even more inappropriate.  Police say she indicated she wanted to have sex with the responding officer, going as far as to grab his arm and rub his chest. 
[01:33:30]  She got away from the questions and trying to get a little personal with our officer, which, you know, he had no part of.  Police gave her a warning about calling 911 when there's no emergency.  They thought that was the end until...  911, where is your emergency?  She called again, and police came to her home a second time in the same night.  When they got there, she said she was mad she was turned down the first time.  It's disturbing.  It's a little scary.  Yes, you are.  It's using police resources unnecessarily. 
[01:34:00]  She even admitted to police she knew she shouldn't call 911 that second time, but said she had no other way to get that officer back to her house.  After that, she was handcuffed and taken to the Charlotte County Jail.  She doesn't need jail time.  This is not a person that's dangerous to anybody.  Neighbors say what she really needs is to be a alcohol addiction.  We found out she's been booked into the Charlotte County Jail five times before.  In Punta Gorda, Laura Roberts.  Punta Gorda.  911 and North.  They made that story so fucking boring. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  Look at that guy, though.  He wants some.  He's like, yeah.  He's like, don't take my neighbor away.  Oh, he probably drops by at night.  Gets a quick blowy.  In a police uniform.  Yeah.  You think he gets a blowy?  I think he gets a quick blowy.  Who's she going to fuck in jail?  Yeah.  Come on.  Yeah, she's a beast.  You think Iraq should have had the other prank call by now?  Oh, yeah.  He's too busy laughing.  Too busy enjoying it?  Yeah.  And then has to walk down making believe he doesn't enjoy it? 
[01:35:00]  We don't even need the whole prank call.  Just a quick clip.  I don't think so.  He pulled it yesterday.  That's all we needed.  Yeah.  Wouldn't it be in the Todd Show file?  Just right in the folder there.  Yeah.  And then you put a couple clips on there.  Done.  Oh, is he doing all the work for us?  Is he putting them together?  I was just going to do it live on the show.  I would think that you would probably want to make it as timely as humanly possible.  He might be putting it together where she goes, you know, hello, and then hello for both calls so you get a real accurate.  Is that what he's doing? 
[01:35:30]  Is that why it's taking a little longer?  I highly doubt it.  Because if that's what he's doing, then of course it would take a little longer.  He's probably shitting.  Oh, you think he's taking one of those big E-rock dumps?  He's dropping a deuce that's probably brickwidge.  That fucking Jurassic Park triceratops dump.  A little pea brain.  He can't focus on more than one thing.  Pea.  He has a walnut-sized brain.  We can talk about the California couple. 
[01:36:00]  They're walking their dog and they find $10 million in rare gold coins.  Why doesn't this ever happen to us or anyone we know?  That's very, very rare, I would assume.  Well, they had another one where some worker found a lottery ticket, remember?  I think we did the story a couple weeks ago now.  And that was like a million dollar fucking winner or something.  And the ticket was just blowing around in the leaves that he was gathering or something like that. 
[01:36:30]  I guess these gold coins came from the 1800s.  But the rare part of the, they said because paper money was illegal in California until like the 1860s or 70s.  Yeah.  So these, to find coins this old in this condition, because they were heavily used back in the 1840s and 1850s, is ultra old.  They said some of these coins might get a million dollars for one of them.  For one coin?  Yeah, they're a million.  Unless you go to a Pawn Stars place and that'll give you like 30 bucks.  Right.  Well, I gotta have it raided, gotta put it in a case, it's gonna sit in my shop for a while. 
[01:37:00]  Well, they were walking on their property, it was like six rotting canisters filled.  Yeah.  That just came to the surface after all these years?  The erosion, a little erosion probably.  Yeah, they saw it on top of one of the cans after a rainstorm and went like, oh, what's that?  And there's fucking gold in there.  And they started digging around the area and there were a bunch of cans buried.  10 million in rare mint-conditioned gold coins buried in the shadow of an old tree.  Nearly all of the 1,427 coins dating from 1847 to 1894 are in uncirculated mint condition. 
[01:37:30]  And they're in like a chronological order of date, too.  Like whoever was doing it was probably OCD back then, but organized them all according to like the year.  Like Jimmy said, the gold pieces, they only add up to $27,000 as far as what...  As far as the weight of gold.  Which is a lot, by the way, in 18...  Oh, in the weight in gold.  In the weight in gold, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:38:00]  But some of them are so rare that coin experts, like Jimmy just said, say they could fetch nearly $1 million a piece.  Yeah, they're not only gold, they're rare fucking coins.  A mint-conditioned gold coin like that from 1840-something?  This guy's going out on a limb.  He says, I don't like to say once in a lifetime for anything, but you don't get an opportunity to handle this kind of material, a treasure like this, ever.  And they're remaining anonymous.  They're really smart.  Because they don't want a bunch of people digging up on their property. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, yeah.  Start fucking digging around.  You think they're out there shoveling every five minutes?  Oh, yeah.  They're middle-aged.  I would be.  Keep going.  Have lived for several years on the rural property in California's gold country where the coins were found.  There's gold in them thar hills.  God damn, that's a lot of money.  I want to find gold coins.  Doesn't, right?  They plan to put most of the coins up for sale through Amazon while holding on to a few keepsakes.  They'll use the money to pay off bills and quietly donate to local charities. 
[01:39:00]  Because I think they said they have a pretty comfortable life.  Yeah.  If you own enough property in that part of the country to take a walk and a path in your own property, you probably got some money.  Rich get richer, right or wrong.  Hey, you know, I find one gold coin on my lunch pail, I'm happy.  I drop it in a Pepsi machine, get myself a Pepsi.  I find a silver coin.  How much is it worth?  25 cents.  That's a quarter.  Wow.  The wife doesn't like me drinking soda.  Pepsi's don't cost a quarter anymore. 
[01:39:30]  What the hell.  Rich get richer, right or wrong.  You're right.  E-Rock's back.  Oh, good.  Hey, what's this kid been doing?  Did you put it together all nice for us?  Miners were shits or whatever the hell you said.  Oh.  Did you put it together all nice for us?  Yeah, it's not what we thought.  Then why are we doing this?  Why?  Because I wrote in saying it's not the same people.  Oh, come on.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  Come on.  Hey, the kid did his homework.  We'll cut our losses.  I'll keep track all week with the scams.  He still uses actors and actresses, though. 
[01:40:00]  We know that.  Yeah.  All right.  I just threw it away.  We'll cut our losses on that one.  But besides, we've got to prepare for our Ted Lang interview.  Lange, I hear.  You're starting to hear Lange more?  I hear it's Lange.  Lange.  L-A-N-G-E.  Lange.  Wait, do they do the open to the love boat, and they go, Ted Lang as your bartender?  Oh, Lange.  I don't think they said it.  They don't say it.  Are you sure?  Because it's just the song.  You're sure.  Positive.  The love, even in the later years?  No, the song's playing.  They wouldn't talk over that wonderful song. 
[01:40:30]  Written by our good friend, Paul Williams.  We should call Paul Williams.  Oh, yeah.  I know.  Love.  Love.  Oh, shit.  Exciting in your climb aboard.  We're expecting you.  Is this him singing or no?  The love, and love.  Life's sweetest reward. 
[01:41:00]  Let it flow.  Let it flow.  Let it flow.  It floats back to you.  The love boat.  Soon we'll be making another one.  The love boat.  Uh-oh.  I'm sorry, you're a love boat crew.  You know how early it is?  California. 
[01:41:30]  Bernie Coppell has your ship's doctor.  It's 5.40 a.m. where Paul Williams is.  He was Siegfried, by the way, the head of chaos.  I'll leave the message with your phone number,  and I'll get back to you as quickly as possible.  Thank you.  On a friendly show.  Paul Williams!  Paul Williams!  Paul Williams!  Oh!  Opie and Anthony, we were thinking of you this morning because Anthony's singing the love  boat theme.  Yeah, we got a Ted Lange, your bartender, is coming onto our show from the love boat, and 
[01:42:00]  we played the theme, and I'm like, Paul Williams wrote this.  So, we were thinking of you, obviously, once again, and we were wondering if there's a question  that you want us to ask to Ted Lange or Ted Lange.  We don't know how to say his last name, really, but we know he points really good.  Yeah, he does the pointing thing.  All right, Paul's back.  Love you, Miss Ship.  I love Paul Williams.  Come on.  He's the best.  Paul.  He's the fucking best.  He's the best.  He's the best.  He's the best. 
[01:42:30]  And he's going to call back on, hey, guys, it's so good that you're thinking of me.  Coming down in three-part harmony.  Yeah.  That Muppet Show episode rules.  Just an old-fashioned love song.  They sing it.  The chorus is different.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How did they...  It's like more honky-tonky.  No, he's like, just an old-fashioned love song.  Love song.  They drag it out of the little arms.  They're like, T-L-A-D-E-N.  Coming down.  I'm fucking mad he doesn't take our phone calls. 
[01:43:00]  Three-part harmony.  Who, Paul Williams?  Yeah, man.  What the fuck?  It's 540.  It's fucking so early in the morning for that little fella.  And he's so small.  I'm going to put my phone right in front of me just in case he calls me.  Last time you left a message, right?  We missed this call.  We did.  Anyway, so we got the gold coins.  That was kind of a cool little story.  That's amazing.  We've got to get ready for Elijah Blue.  He's going to be here.  I know, Elijah Blue.  Elijah Wood.  Elijah Blue. 
[01:43:30]  Who's Elijah Blue?  Elijah Blue is Greg Allman's son with Cher.  Oh, right.  Elijah Wood, of course.  I bet Bill Devane has gold coins buried on his property.  You think?  You know what?  His father told him to buy land, and he did.  And he did pretty well for himself.  Yeah.  And then he learned how to ride horses.  He learned how to fly airplanes.  He learned how to ride motorcycles.  Whoa.  He chops his own wood.  And he's got a bunch of fucking gold.  How's he doing financially?  It's great.  What's in your safe? 
[01:44:00]  He's doing great.  Bill Devane.  Pretty well for himself?  What a fucking braggart.  He does braggart.  I'm in my airplane.  My father told me to buy land.  I did.  I did pretty good for myself.  We don't all have such good fathers, Bill Devane.  How'd you buy fucking land?  You had to, you know, didn't come out of nowhere.  He got those fucking, that money from like, um, from fucking, uh, Marathon Man.  And all the good land has been bought up already.  You know when you're driving around, driving down a highway and you see like land for sale? 
[01:44:30]  You know that shitty land.  Shite.  Look at Bill Devane.  Where's the good land that we could still buy?  God damn.  Bill Devane has it all.  Bill Devane's just pointing at his land.  He's done well for himself.  He's on horseback.  Braggart.  That's a great business if it was 1905.  Right.  Where's the good land?  Where is it?  You've got to kind of guess now.  Yeah.  Uh, let me say hi to Kevin.  He's got more on the story of the couple that found those gold coins.  Oh, does he?  Kevin, what do you got on that story, sir?  I was reading last night, the state of California has already requested the anonymous couple 
[01:45:00]  to come forward so that they can send them a bill for the quote-unquote income taxes that  they will receive.  The government's going to swipe some of this?  Isn't that amazing?  Somebody has also filed a lawsuit claiming that they own the mineral rights to the land.  That's not a mineral rights thing.  It's crazy.  A lawsuit.  By the way.  Of course.  Of course.  This is why companies are how they are.  If you find any shit in your backyard, don't tell anybody. 
[01:45:30]  Right.  Don't tell anybody.  Go enjoy your life and sell that shit.  But we wonder why companies...  Why are companies like this?  Like, because some fucking pig has to file a lawsuit to try to get something for themselves.  Of course.  That's why companies are.  That's not the government doing that.  That's not the lawyers doing that.  That's some scumbag citizen going, I want some for me.  Yeah.  It sounds like an amazing story.  Watch.  It'll be a nightmare for these people in the air. 
[01:46:00]  It'll turn out they should have never found these fucking good coins.  You watch.  We're going to take a break.  Get ready for Elijah Wood.  And there's something else, but whatever.  We'll figure it out, I guess.  Right?  When's Ted Lange coming in?  10 o'clock unless he cancels.  Oh, no.  What do you think he'll cancel?  He'll cancel.  Well, he might, because he's fucking, there's a bunch of shows trying to get him, and he  chose us.  Yeah.  Wait, he might be canceling?  That's what I've heard.  I'm kind of hoping. 
[01:46:30]  What else?  You know what I do when I'm stressed out?  Yeah.  I take my legs and I put them straight out to get a yoga move?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I put my legs straight out, and I go, hee-dee-dee-dee-dee.  That's retarded.  Oh, there was something else.  Today's podcast day.  Oh, check those numbers, Sammy.  Yeah, let's go take a look.  The Opie and Anthony podcast, we give you an hour to sometimes two hours a week every Wednesday.  And for bragging rights, if you can, get our podcast through iTunes.  If you can't, just get the podcast.  That's fine. 
[01:47:00]  But if you do have a choice, choose iTunes, so we can be up there with the big boys.  All right?  Ted was...  This week's podcast, sorry, podcast number 42 is the best of...  Huh?  Scott and Todd.  All right.  We're really hammering it home.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  The best of Scott and Todd, which means what?  The best of Jocktober with Scott and Todd?  Yeah, all Scott and Todd segments.  Nice.  All right.  Go back to your seat.  And we're checking our numbers right now.  Ted Lange was in the 1986 TV movie, That's My Mama Now. 
[01:47:30]  Oh.  Up and down.  Stop it.  Stop.  Stop.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Okay.  Why is it taking so long to check our numbers?  Sam's just fucking around over here.  Because I tilt the screen.  Sam's not doing his job.  He's just fudging around.  I think the Patrice O'Neill Memorial Podcast is a little light in the numbers.  Let's get that one up a little bit more, people. 
[01:48:00]  The Ricky Gervais and Joe Rogan one's doing very well.  Penn Jillette and Louis C.K. together doing very well.  Bob Kelly, excuse me, puking is doing very well.  Ice Cube and Jerry Springer could do a little better.  And then I guess that's about it for the podcast.  Wait a minute.  Jim Norton hates animals is killing.  And, ooh, looks like so.  All right, Sam.  Sam.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[01:48:30]  So go get our podcast, people.  Do it now.  Do it now.  We've got Elijah Wood coming into the studio.  Oh.  Promoting Grand Piano, opening Friday, March 7th.  Grand Piano.  Yes.  What's that about?  Jimmy saw the movie.  I didn't see it.  I'll wait until he comes in.  I don't know how much to say or give away.  Let's just say he's a piano player and a prodigy. 
[01:49:00]  And he's giving a performance.  And things are not good.  Let me see what it says in the actual.  You said prodigy?  Yes.  Smack my bitch.  All right.  Smack my bitch.  Fire starter.  Fire starter.  Let's see this.  Well, I'll wait until Elijah comes in.  I don't know where he is.  Yo, where's the glass screen cleaner shit?  I knew I shouldn't have let you guys go.  Oh, man.  See what happened?  You never gave it back.  You probably took it.  Well, we, we, we.  Where's Mars?  We had it up here on the console.  And someone took it. 
[01:49:30]  And then someone took it.  Yeah.  Never fails.  Oh, well.  You can't have anything nice around here.  Pelvic bone.  Damn it, what?  Hey, we, uh, we just saw a big star in the bathroom.  Oh, really?  Yes, we did.  Who we had on this show.  Had on the show a few times.  And I got absolutely nothing from this man.  Well, he's only on once, though.  I think he was only on once.  Yes, with his son.  I filled him in the elevator once, too.  With his son?  Yeah.  That's a good one.  Deepak Chopra. 
[01:50:00]  Oh.  I go, yo, Deepak.  I go, what?  You're in the building?  You're not doing our show?  And he said, what?  Not much.  He's doing a movie, a TV show.  A TV show or something.  Oh, yeah?  Doing a TV show.  Reality show?  And then, I said, you know, Opie from Opie and Anthony.  And then all of a sudden, he had to awkwardly go, so how's it going?  Like, he didn't want to ask that.  Of course he didn't.  I put him in a bad spot.  In the bathroom, especially.  So how's it going?  I say this about Deepak Chopra. 
[01:50:30]  He is a fucking doer.  Yeah.  He does things, man.  Like, Robert Rodriguez, I thought of all day yesterday.  Because he was, he just does stuff.  Like, even when he was like a nobody, he wants to do something, he makes it.  He makes his own music.  Like, he's not a talker.  Just do it, right?  Yeah, man.  All day, I was like, God damn it, this guy is.  He's motivated.  Yes.  Yeah.  Let's bring him in.  You hear that, Tim?  Bring him in.  Enough with the talking.  Let's get some stuff done.  Hey, there he is.  Hey, Elijah.  Come on in.  Take a seat, sir. 
[01:51:00]  Welcome back to the show.  I feel like I see you guys like every few months.  I know.  Every few months, you pop in.  It is nice.  How are you doing?  Good?  I'm very well.  Doing good?  I have a cold, but that's different.  Oh, man.  Oh, quick.  Get me Purell.  I shook his hand.  So this weekend, I can tell everyone, I got this cold from Elijah Woods.  That's true.  There's nothing special about it.  No.  Is it the flu?  I don't think it's the flu.  Jeez.  You go flu shot?  No, I don't believe in it.  I completely believe in the flu shot.  I don't either.  Ask Anthony. 
[01:51:30]  I get the flu every year for two, three weeks at a time.  Four or five years in a row, no flu.  I sort of feel like we need to build up our own immunity to that shit.  That's what I kind of like doing.  I think, you know, the flu shot, my theory is the flu shot, if you keep taking it, your  own body's immune system starts to not be able to battle it naturally.  Yeah.  I don't think that's a good thing.  And then if you skip one year, uh-oh.  And so what?  You get the flu.  Fuck it.  Oh.  Yeah.  Flu stinks.  A flu is awful.  It's horrendous.  And I have to be honest with you.  I like to take the flu shot because I figure, like, you know, when I gave up condoms in 
[01:52:00]  1988, I have to help my body all I can.  Oh, Jesus.  My body.  It was 19.  If you made that choice, then maybe you really should get the flu shot.  Yeah.  I'm talking about a taxed immune system.  Yeah.  My immune system's like, look, we're busy.  We're busy working on this.  Do you want to help us out with that?  And it was 1988.  You know that for sure, huh?  It absolutely was.  Do you remember the last time you had a condom on?  Yes.  It was also the first time I had a condom on.  I didn't tell it sounds for me.  This isn't for me. 
[01:52:30]  Absolutely not.  This isn't for me.  I don't care for that at all.  You're a brave man.  That's right.  My whole life is just taking dice and just kind of throwing money.  Yeah.  You know how it is.  Well, welcome back.  Thanks.  Sometimes I like a good flu or a good sick.  Yeah.  Someone's in it and maybe take care of you.  And eat soup.  Yeah.  If you've got the time.  I mean, the worst thing is getting sick and then having to work.  But if you've got the time to just convalesce, I like it too.  And watch some TV.  There you go.  And you drop a quick seven pounds. 
[01:53:00]  Right.  Damn, I look good.  You get some abs.  Right.  You're starving.  And then that first meal.  Those flu abs, man.  Yeah.  Flu abs are great.  Really.  But then the first time you feel like eating, then of course you eat like a pig.  Yeah.  You blow it.  The seven pounds goes back on.  Yeah, here you go.  But you're not finding really good things in the flu.  You're saying like, well, you know, you can watch TV and eat soup.  Like being healthy, there's no way you can eat soup and watch TV unless you're shitting  fluid.  Well, I like getting sick too because it's the only time I ever take NyQuil.  And I love NyQuil.  Oh, NyQuil's great.  NyQuil's wonderful. 
[01:53:30]  It's just so much.  That should not be legal.  It's your right to sleep.  It shouldn't be.  NyQuil.  And there are plenty of people who abuse NyQuil.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we knew one.  Yeah, we knew.  Yeah, he talked about it.  Well, he talked about it.  He talked about it.  Oh, no shit.  Our pal Jay Moore was all in with NyQuil.  With his blue-green tongue.  Oh, yeah.  Jesus.  All in.  I think he's doing much better with that.  Jay's great.  Yeah, we love Jay Moore.  But it's scary how many coffee...  There's one coffee restaurant that doesn't have it, though, because I can't take it, but  it's called Buckley's in Canada. 
[01:54:00]  And their whole slug line is, it tastes awful and it works.  And it really does...  It smells like something you clean...  You know what it smells like?  A peat booth.  A peat booth?  Let me explain.  Only Jimmy...  What the hell is a peat booth?  Oh, a peat booth is one of those sex booths that you...  Oh, right.  And it smells like ammonia.  Oh!  Ammonia.  Because the floors always smell like ammonia in those places.  I know, I brought my gum on them.  That's horrendous.  That's bad.  Ammonia, because they're constantly...  It smells actually very...  Peat booth juice. 
[01:54:30]  Yes.  But it'll make you feel better.  Yeah, as long as you feel better.  Thanks, sweetie.  Oh, he brought actual...  Well, no, he's got a cold.  I want to just make sure.  And after my story, I'm sure he'll want to Purell his hand.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, he really needs it.  Yeah, it's a mutual wave.  That's wrong with you.  We say hello, we wave goodbye.  You know, in the UK, they have in their...  Their headache medicine has codeine.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  Canada too, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  That also makes a difference.  Can you run into the pharmacy up there and just...  Hey, I'll take some of that and bring it back to the States. 
[01:55:00]  Yes, we can.  And I was in Canada with a girl one time and she thought that she had a venereal disease.  What is it with you?  Well, I was panicked.  Was this before or after you decided to stop using condoms?  Long after.  Oh, yeah.  And she's like, you know, her pussy was fucked up and she was really freaking out.  And believe me, in my heart, I was like, I'm like, I don't know what it could be.  You know, meanwhile, I'm going through like what I had done the whole week before.  Wait, wait, wait.  This or this.  What was wrong with the pussy?  I need to know.  Well, we had a doctor come. 
[01:55:30]  I paid for a doctor to come and...  What did it look like?  Nothing.  But she felt really bad inside.  And there was something wrong and she was freaking...  Emotionally or...  Yeah, right.  Later on, you realize that's just being with Jim.  Yeah.  It was like when a Virgin Mary statue cried.  It was just one tear leaking down her side.  Holy shit.  But no, I had a doctor come to the hotel.  We were so freaked out and we went and got her something.  It turns out...  I took her to the emergency room.  She was in such agony. 
[01:56:00]  Wow.  And she had such...  She said she felt an itch deep inside of her and she was out of her fucking mind.  Oh, my God.  And we thought there was something wrong and I've never panicked like that.  Like, oh, my God, did I get...  But it turns out when she got back to the States, it literally was just some kind of a reaction  and a yeast infection inside.  That's all it was.  Holy Christ.  It was like all those things that women get.  But this one just hit her really bad.  But I'm so glad I didn't fess up to anything.  Right?  You were this close.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  And then how do you explain that?  Like, well, you know, I thought it was a girl. 
[01:56:30]  But no, it was one of those things that we would be trying to do.  And I'm like, well, did she go out and do anything?  Like, you started wondering.  Right.  We got two phone calls for Elijah already.  Oh, cool.  Oh, fun.  Let's go to Austin.  Austin.  Elijah Wood in studio.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  How are you, Elijah?  Hey, man.  How are you?  I'm good, buddy.  Hey, I just wanted to make a quick comment on the flu shot thing, man.  I actually work in health down here in Houston, Texas. 
[01:57:00]  Yesterday I sat in on a seminar giving it with the Methodist healthcare system down here about  boring.  Yes, sir, please.  Some rising rates of very serious diseases.  A lot of that's caused by people not getting vaccinated.  You know, polio, things like that are coming back worldwide because there's been a very  large push to go away from vaccines.  People like Jim Carrey and Gene McCarthy running out there saying that.  Yeah, we know all that.  But what are you getting at with the flu shot? 
[01:57:30]  Well, I mean, the flu shot is a pretty important thing.  You actually look at how many people per year die of the flu.  Yeah, those people are supposed to die.  Well, one could argue, too, that the people who are dying have a weakened immune system  anyway, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Sure.  Look, I hear what you're saying.  I think you're right.  I mean, obviously, polio vaccinations, these things are important.  I don't know about the flu, though.  I'm not totally convinced.  Elijah Wood against vaccinations.  That's not at all what I'm saying, right? 
[01:58:00]  That's not at all what I'm saying.  Elijah Wood says, let them die.  I just, listen, I think that certain vaccinations are really important, but I also think it's  really important to build up your own immunity and eat well and, you know what I mean?  Like, we have, our bodies are built to withstand these sorts of things, and I think it's important  to do that.  Do you work out or anything, or are you just genetically thin, or are you lucky?  Not you.  I used to.  I just haven't had time in recent years, but, yeah, I used to. 
[01:58:30]  You don't gain weight.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I eat relatively well, you know.  You take care of yourself.  I do.  I try to, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And we have another phone call for you from Bob.  Bob.  Hey, Elijah.  How's it going?  Hey, buddy.  How's it going?  Hey, I loved you and all your movies, and just wondering, are you going to make Flipper 2?  Oh, Jesus.  That's not what.  What an ass.  That's not what.  That's not in the cards, I don't think. 
[01:59:00]  No, I love the show.  It's my favorite.  All right, thank you.  Sorry.  He was going to ask.  Oh, whatever.  Oh, yeah.  Who listens to Jim Carrey and Jenny McCarthy anyway?  It's like, I mean.  A lot of people did for a while, Jimmy.  Because they're celebrities.  It's so silly.  We listen to our celebrities.  Well, the situation, as it pertains to Jenny McCarthy, wasn't it about how certain vaccinations  actually caused autism?  Yeah, yeah.  She thought it might be.  Yeah.  Right.  But listen to a doctor, not a celebrity. 
[01:59:30]  Like, you know, maybe something happened to her and you could hear her opinion, but  don't allow your own children's vaccination to be based on what a celebrity.  Go to your own doctor.  Yeah, I think over the years it's been proven that to inoculate kids is better than to not.  Yes.  I mean, eradicating some deadly diseases.  I got two kids.  I'm not going to take that chance.  No, of course.  I'll assume my pediatrician knows what the fuck they're talking about.  Of course, yeah.  So, I mean.  God.  My immune system's good, though.  Like, I take a little coldies, if I get that, I stump for them. 
[02:00:00]  I feel something.  Those little coldies, they shed gum.  Sure, sure.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  It knocks it out by, like, a third.  Coldies is really good.  Amazing.  Yeah.  And I usually don't like that stuff.  Airborne's good, too, if you're about to take a flight.  Yeah, yeah.  Flights are the worst, because it's just a cesspool of...  Yeah, right, germs just recirculating around.  And I always eat my lunch in the bathroom on the toilet.  It's just the way I do it.  I mean, sitting on the floor, using the toilet as a table.  To build up that immune system.  You've got to do that.  Expose yourself to those germs, man.  I just like it.  It's healthy.  How did we get on this subject when we have Elijah in here? 
[02:00:30]  Well, we shook hands.  Talk about his movie, for the love of God.  But this is good, though.  This is good.  This is good stuff.  Yeah.  I did see it.  I watched it.  And I liked it.  It was...  Grand piano.  Grand piano, you saw it.  Yes.  Oh, great.  I don't know how much to give away, so I was going to let you kind of...  I'll start the synopsis as you're a piano player and a prodigy who's...  You're doing your first concert after something on a meltdown.  Yeah.  And how much am I allowed to say?  You can say more than that.  Okay, at the very end.  That's it.  The last frame.  The last moment.  But no, it stars Elijah and John Cusack. 
[02:01:00]  Is that the first time you're working with him?  First time, yeah.  Wow.  It was a real treat.  He's great, man.  I grew up watching him.  Yeah.  He's a total icon.  Yeah, isn't that so odd?  He's one of those, like, weird, wacky kind of kid, wacky movie guys, and he grows up  to be a fine actor.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  He's a bigger guy in person.  He's a very tall.  He's a giant ham.  I can't believe how big he was.  He's a big guy.  He's like 6'2 or 6'3.  He's very tall.  I'm definitely dwarfed by him. 
[02:01:30]  That's the truth.  Yeah, he's a big guy.  Who was the guy who played your wife?  She was really high.  Carrie Bichet.  What else has she been in?  She's lovely.  She was in Argo most recently.  She's extraordinary.  Okay, yeah.  Yeah, she's really wonderful.  And you're getting ready to play this concert, I guess, on this famous guy's piano who is  dead, and you're going to try to play a really tough piece, and then you're opening your  music book, and there's threatening notes in the music book.  Yeah, that basically, I start to go through my notations, and I see these messages that 
[02:02:00]  essentially say that if I miss a note, that I'll be killed, and I see that there's a gun  trained on me with a laser pointer.  Wow.  And initially, I don't take it seriously until he shoots the ground, and I'm like, oh, fuck,  that's real.  So yeah, it's essentially that my character is forced to play, and ultimately, what he  learns is that he's going to be forced to play a very impossible piece that he would  try to stay away from for a long time.  Otherwise, he'll be killed, and his wife will be killed. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, and there's a way that, and it makes sense the way you communicate with him during  the whole piece, and he communicates with you, and it's like the way they wrote it, again,  I don't want to give away the whole, it was just well done, the communication between  you two.  I'm like, all right, that's how that would happen.  Like, that's the only way that could happen, and it makes sense, but it was a tremendously  original concept for a film.  Now, this is based off of the Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck episode, where Daffy put the  dynamite under the key of the piano. 
[02:03:00]  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Now, you dumb bunny, try it again!  No, well, the way this film is sold is, it's the piano role Adrian Brody was frightened  to take.  It was a tremendously original concept for a thriller, which was great.  Yeah, that is a little bit of stress on there, as a guy would be playing the piano, yeah.  And I had to learn, because I don't play piano, I took lessons when I was a kid, but like 
[02:03:30]  so many kids, I quit.  So I had the basic sort of rudiments down, but...  How does a quitting piano work out for you?  Nah, you know?  All right.  It's not too shabby.  It's all right.  I got a movie-making question.  So how do they make it look good when you're playing the piano?  So I did three weeks of piano lessons with the music that we used in the film prior to  going to Barcelona, because we shot just outside of Barcelona.  And then an additional two weeks once I got to Barcelona with my instructor, who was also  my double for any of the bits where you didn't see my face. 
[02:04:00]  Right.  Yeah, but he was black.  They should have used a white guy, because the hands came out of the system.  It's a low-budget film.  Yeah.  But it was complicated.  I mean, the pieces of music are extremely fast.  It's a lot of dexterity, sort of hand movements that I wasn't used to.  So the learning curve was super intense.  But ultimately, what really helped is I asked the instructor if he could film his hands down  on the keyboards for all the pieces of music that I had to learn, so that for reference, 
[02:04:30]  whenever I had to, you know, for like the next day's amount of pieces of music, I could  then look top-down at the hands and sort of have almost like a muscle memory view.  So you were getting dailies of two hands.  Basically.  But that helped in terms of just orientation and how hands move.  I could sort of memorize that.  Were you making clunky noise, though, sometimes?  Like, da-dang-dang-dang-dang-dang-dang.  Well, they muted the piano.  Right.  Oh, wow.  Which was great, because what was happening...  Oh, that's how they do that. 
[02:05:00]  Because what was happening when I was actually rehearsing with a real piano is I was so...  My ear is relatively good, so I would hear if I was wrong, and that would fuck me up.  Right.  So taking the music out of it made it so that I was just focusing on being in the right  place at the right time.  So it had more to do with where the hands were and rhythm and timing more than anything.  Did your double have to start biting his nails, too?  Very astute observation.  He didn't, actually.  That was actually from the extras on fucking Lord of the Rings. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  I still bite my fingernails.  Peter Jackson loved it, apparently, because it was very Hobbit-like to have, like...  Well, yeah, and I think, you know, Frodo was an anxious character because of the ring,  and so it kind of made sense.  And wasn't that also mentioned in this movie?  There was a reference to that in the movie, wasn't there?  The character bites his nails.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Wow, okay.  There was a reference to that in the film.  That's true.  Yeah, that's a good way to cover.  You're very good at...  I was thinking, so there's a scene early on where you're on your way to this performance,  your first performance in a while, there's a big line, and you're in the limo, 
[02:06:00]  and you're changing, and you're very good at...  And I noticed this from the last film where you played that psychotic, it was a point-of-view  film.  Oh, Maniac, yeah.  Yeah, you're really good at...  I'm trying to describe what it is that I'm trying to say.  But at doing something when something else is obviously going on, for some reason, there  was a feeling of dread I got while you were changing, and there's something really shitty  is going to happen.  And I don't know if that's just in the way these last two films have been set up or if 
[02:06:30]  it's something you're doing, but it's hard to be comfortable watching.  And I say that in a really good way.  Oh, thanks, man.  Yeah, it was like, something is really wrong with this.  Like, I know this is not a good thing, even though it's just changing and having a conversation  on the phone.  Worst description ever given by somebody who talks for a living.  I should get a fucking stunt brain in here, like, just whisper to a fucking bright person,  and they can relay what I'm trying to say.  I understand.  No, I appreciate it.  I mean, the character's definitely dreading what he's about to experience, so if that 
[02:07:00]  came across, then that was intentional.  Yeah, it was just, it was really good, man.  And the movie comes out a week from Friday, so it's called Grand Piano.  It's on iTunes now.  It came out as VOD first.  I love how they're doing that, man.  Yes, I do, too.  It's so cool.  It's so...  Why wait?  I know.  When it's ready.  Well, I think what's great about it, too, I mean, there's arguments to be made either  side, but what I think is great is that a lot of these films, these independent films  or foreign films, you know, if they were only theatrical, they only go to the major cities  of the U.S. 
[02:07:30]  Yep.  To art house cinemas.  So that leaves out a massive swath of people, whereas now, you know, people in the Midwest  who wouldn't have access to these films can go on to iTunes and see them, and I think  that's a really good thing.  There are some visual, like, big CG movies and stuff that you kind of want to see in a  theater.  Yeah.  But a lot of these really well-done, smaller movies, good enough to see at home.  It's great.  It is great.  You don't want to get Godzilla 3D on iTunes before you go to the theater and see it.  I mean, I would recommend seeing this film in the theater. 
[02:08:00]  It's super cinematic.  It definitely...  Eugenio Mira, who's the director, he just did such an incredible job.  It's a real credit to him as a director and as a sort of visual mastermind.  It's a real throwback, the film.  It feels like something from the 40s or the silent film era in terms of the way that it's  constructed.  It really feels like cinema.  And he uses that language of cinema to articulate kind of what's happening over the course of  the film.  Because if you look at it, the movie is really a guy sitting at a piano. 
[02:08:30]  Yes.  That's what it is.  So that you have to sort of construct it and craft something to help move the piece  along so that it's not banal.  Yeah, yeah.  And it is quite an extraordinary piece.  And it's a real credit to him and to the cinematographer.  We just set up a camera on a tripod.  One shot right at him for two hours.  Like a German minimalist film.  Well, we got some great phone calls coming in.  Gregory in Jersey.  I somehow doubt that.  No, this is a good one.  Our listeners.  Gregory. 
[02:09:00]  Gregory.  Hey, hey, how are you?  What's going on?  Hey, Elijah.  I was just wondering about your upcoming film called Cooties and your move towards genre  horror films.  Are you a huge fan of that genre now?  I am.  I mean, I have been my entire life.  And yeah, I started this production company called Spectre Vision about three years ago  with the aim to produce essentially horror and genre films.  Cooties got quite the buzz in what?  Aspen was it?  It was, no, Sundance.  Oh, Sundance. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Sundance.  Yeah, yeah.  And Lionsgate picked it up.  Coming out of there.  Yeah, we're really excited.  It was kind of incredible for us because these are-  What a cool fucking concept that is, man.  What is the concept that is?  The concept is that it was written by Lee Wannell who wrote Saw and Ian Brennan who co-created  Glee.  So it's the creators of Saw and Glee wrote this script for us.  Jesus.  And it's effectively about a zombie-like virus that affects children, but pre-puberty.  Beyond that, it doesn't affect them.  So it turns them into savages if they haven't gone through puberty yet. 
[02:10:00]  So it's about a group of teachers who are stuck in this school as this outbreak occurs.  Oh, wow.  It's like zombie kids.  Savage kids.  It's a horror comedy.  I mean, obviously it's called Cooties.  Yeah, Cooties.  That's what kids get.  That sounds great.  We're excited about it.  You get Cooties.  Yeah, you seem to like these independent- Is it because the scripts are just better or  they're a little bit freer than a lot of the other?  Because a lot of the bigger budget films seem to have kind of a similar, all right,  we know where this is going.  But the two I've seen you've done recently are just completely different than what you'd 
[02:10:30]  expect a major company to release.  That tends to be the case.  I mean, I'm drawn to material.  And more often than not, the material that I love happens to be small and independent  because they don't get financed at a larger budgetary.  But it's funny.  Grand Piano, I feel like that movie in the 90s would have been a studio movie.  If you look at it, the way that it's constructed, it's kind of like a big cinematic thriller.  But they don't make those movies anymore. 
[02:11:00]  But looking at it now, you're like, that would have been made by a studio in the 90s.  Do you think it's because of 3D and technology they're not making it anymore because the real  money is in, again, Godzilla and all these other things?  That's the thing.  I think studios are a little bit gun-shy to take risks these days.  I think that they're in the business of making a return.  They have so many investors.  They've got so many people who are required to get their sort of money back.  So they're about making sequels and franchises and things that they know will have a return. 
[02:11:30]  And immediately, they don't want a slow build on anything or a buzz.  They want first weekend, man, you better be putting it over the top.  It used to be a long game.  You'd get in there and you'd support a film and see it through for a long time to build its audience.  And so now it's like, if it fails the first weekend, it's a failure, which is fucking insane.  Yeah, yeah.  The margin of success is so small now, you know.  See, I'm trying to get a film finance.  And the studios, they just, it's so stupid.  Oh, what film, Jim?  It's about a man who's walking. 
[02:12:00]  What are you doing?  No, it's a man who's walking.  This is real.  And the man finds a sheet of paper, and he just knows a poem needs to go on it.  And the entire film is him deciding what poem to put on this piece of paper that he's found.  Oh, he stinkeroo.  And it's a four-hour, 3-D, big budget.  Extravaganza.  But the end, when he actually writes that poem, it's going to be so sad.  Yes, when that pen comes out and everybody in the audience ducks because it's 3-D.  That's the only time the 3-D technology is used. 
[02:12:30]  It's just for the pen.  For the pen.  But you don't tell the audience, so they sit there the whole time with the glasses on.  Yes.  Waiting for what happens.  But what they don't realize is that the glasses make it regular.  You have to take the glasses off for it to be 3-D.  This is a horrible idea.  I wonder why you can't get financing for that.  I know, I know.  It seems ridiculous.  I know.  I want Forrest Whitaker to be in this.  As the man who drops the paper.  We've got your biggest fan on the phone right now. 
[02:13:00]  Sean is saying he's your biggest fan.  Sean.  Palo Alto.  What's up, Sean?  Hey, I am a huge fan.  I actually knew that if I called, I'd be on hold and I could listen to the interview.  So with Elijah Wood, I wasn't necessarily a fan of Elijah Wood to begin with.  But it turns out this guy is in a ton of movies that we all enjoy.  And then when he did the Frodo character, you figure, well, that'll always be, you know,  he's always going to be Frodo.  But he was able to break that. 
[02:13:30]  In fact, the Wilford character is one of my favorite characters now.  Oh, thanks, man.  Yeah.  And then I saw this freaking creepy psycho killer movie.  And to have someone like you play the psycho killer totally made the movie more interesting  and enjoyable.  Oh, cool.  Yeah, I think you do a fantastic job.  And I totally look forward to all your projects.  And the grand piano I saw was on demand, and I'm definitely going to watch it.  You got a question for Elijah?  No, I just wanted to suck his dick. 
[02:14:00]  Just want to lap his ass a little and hang up.  That's good.  Way to bring it home at the end.  I got a question.  Way to bring it home at the end.  What a way to bring it home.  What are you going to do?  Thank you, Sean.  I'll keep you on hold so you can keep listening.  Thanks, Steve.  Is Wilford coming back?  It is.  Yeah, we go into the fourth and final season in March.  Wow.  Why only four?  Is that your decision?  Four.  No.  You know, it's interesting.  When we started the show, I kind of hoped it would only last four or five seasons.  Primarily because I feel like the conceit of a guy who has sort of psychological issues, 
[02:14:30]  and the reason that Wilford exists is because of the psychological issues, that can only  last for so long before you start just beating the same drum.  You start, yeah.  And I never wanted that to be the case.  I wanted it to have a sort of beginning, middle, and an end.  And if there's a way to sort of end it, four or five seasons seems right.  So it was sort of like a mutual thing that it all kind of came to an end.  And it feels right.  And I'm really excited about actually being able to, because I think what would have been 
[02:15:00]  the shame is canceling the show and then not having a chance to finish it out and to close  it out.  So we get that chance, and we're really excited.  Yeah, it's hard to find a concept that can just be open-ended and go.  Like my show that I'm pitching, The Dance Master.  I mean, I'm hoping that can last for...  I can't.  The Dance Master.  It's about a man who tries to stop poverty and war by teaching people to dance one village  at a time.  When I go around the world, I teach people the gift of dance. 
[02:15:30]  Another from PU Productions.  Do you ever watch Improv Everywhere or Improv Anywhere?  It's a website, and they do these crazy mass improvs, and they have people film them.  And sometimes they do mass dances in public spaces.  Oh, man, Jim.  It's pretty amazing.  Taking your idea.  Well, no, because I'm the dance master.  It's a different thing.  The problem is we can't get...  Are you the dance master?  Of course I am, yes.  Because I teach people the gift of dance. 
[02:16:00]  And I go from village to village and from hamlet to hamlet, and I show them.  But you don't dance.  No, I don't.  We can't get the music rights for anything.  So it's a little halt in the production.  So instead of wars, we could just have dance-offs.  That's...  You know what I mean?  Like breakdances.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it's kind of like...  I could see breakdancing in the Middle East, man.  Yeah, that's how we solve our problem.  There's a big dance-off at the end of every season.  Oh, I gotcha.  And I can beat it.  I like it.  Yeah.  I can beat it.  That sounds fantastic. 
[02:16:30]  Let's go to John in North Carolina.  John.  John.  John.  Hey, Elijah.  My sons and I are big fans, but my question is, the movie Maniac, which was just freaking  awesome on your remake, really awesome, because the original's great, too.  Yeah, it is.  But we couldn't figure out, I couldn't anyway, what city it was shot in.  I thought it was L.A., the gritty part of L.A.  Yeah.  And where the hell did you get all the mannequins from?  We did shoot in L.A.  It was downtown Los Angeles, so the original was set in New York, obviously. 
[02:17:00]  But we were keen on differentiating, I think, from New York.  And Los Angeles, in terms of film shoots, tends to not shoot downtown, and we were really  excited about shooting downtown in a way that is not typically seen.  Why does that?  Why is that the case?  Yeah.  Downtown's a funny place.  It's a weird place.  It's one word for it.  It sort of is.  You know, it's sort of past its prime, and it's a little bit rough around the edges.  I mean, it's kind of going through a revolution now. 
[02:17:30]  There's all sorts of restaurants and bars and stuff opening.  A lot of people are moving down there, but it typically doesn't get filmed.  The other parts of L.A. get shot a lot more than downtown, so that was part of the reason.  And then the mannequins, I can't remember where we got the mannequins from.  So, can't be much help to you there.  I'm sorry.  Elijah didn't bring them in.  But the mannequins are awesome.  And a lot of them were vintage, too.  What's that?  I said Jimmy would like some of those mannequins in that movie.  Yeah, there's probably a few I would like.  There's some creepy ones, for sure. 
[02:18:00]  Well, Elijah has to go.  There was one mannequin that had...  Because, you know, mannequins are built for putting clothes on for displays.  That's the idea.  There was one mannequin, you could see it in the movie, that had what looked like breast implants.  It was the strangest thing.  Because typically mannequin proportions are a lot slimmer and the breasts are a lot smaller for the frames.  And this literally was gigantic, inhuman breasts.  And it was weird because it was a male mannequin for hats. 
[02:18:30]  There was no reason for those giant breasts.  They distracted from the felt hats.  And they're telling us you have to leave.  Did we talk to you last time real quick?  He's very busy.  When you were going in and out, the genius of Elijah was going in and out.  And that was you, right?  They wore the same outfit every day so they could not take pictures of you, the paparazzi.  What was this?  Did you do that or no?  No.  Who did that?  Who am I thinking of that did that?  What genius did that?  I don't know.  It was an actor in a plane.  I thought it might be you.  I can't remember who it was. 
[02:19:00]  Wait, he wore the same outfit every day.  The paparazzi's pictures were no good because every day walking in and out of the plane...  So it was as if it was the same day.  They can't use the photos.  If you're walking in and out of the same day, every day wearing a burgundy sweatshirt and  a red hat, what are they going to do?  Take that picture?  Who are they going to sell it to?  No one gives a fuck after day one.  That's interesting.  And I thought it was you for some reason, wasn't it?  That's why we did talk about it.  That's a quiet way to fight it.  I like it.  Yeah.  Okay.  Interesting.  These strategies.  I do not know who I'm mixing up with you then.  I didn't do that.  All right.  Were you in Lord of the Rings?  Did I get the right guy? 
[02:19:30]  What a way to end the interview.  We're having a good time and I mentioned someone else.  By the way, you were great in Star Trek.  I really made a song.  But the movie is called Grand Piano.  Grand Piano.  And it's on iTunes now.  You can get it.  Is it on demand or just iTunes?  It's on iTunes and I think on various VOD platforms.  Or go to Wood Elijah is Elijah's Twitter.  That's my Twitter, yeah.  And if you want to go to a theater, because I've seen it.  Please see this.  We actually shot it on film, which is a crazy thing these days. 
[02:20:00]  We shot it on Super 35.  So it demands to be seen on the big screen, I think.  Yeah.  It's really beautifully done and extremely well acted.  Thank you, sir.  And it's next Friday, March 7th.  And the greats.  Elijah moved.  Guys, it's always a pleasure.  Thanks, man.  Love it.  We really covered a lot of ground today.  Oh, it certainly did.  Has to be well endowed.  Okay.  Am I doing all right so far?  Great.  Great.  Okay, and to have sex with on a balcony.  For the right man, I'm willing to give oral.  On a balcony. 
[02:20:30]  Even though it might be against your instincts.  I prefer somebody to not throw me off the balcony and bend me over and give me the old he-ho.  I'm into the following things.  Water sports, ass play, I'd be willing to experiment with toys.  Under the right circumstances, I would go both ways.  So feel free to bring a friend.  Call into the Opie and Anthony Show, 866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  And give me the ride of my life.  You think anybody's going to call back on that one?  100%. 
[02:21:00]  Call the Opie and Anthony Show today.  Lady Di does.  Opie and Anthony have been excelling at this for 20 years.  Need proof?  Listen to this 20th anniversary Opie and Anthony radio jam.  Okay, here's the deal.  We clear off the console here, right?  We get Stalker Patty completely naked, okay?  All right.  Mousetraps all over the place.

[02:24:00]  Opie and Anthony are back on Sirius XM.  People!  People!  Roar!  Ted Lang.  Blanche.  Ted Lange. 
[02:24:30]  Blanche.  Blanche.  I don't know what it is.  Blanche.  Blanche.  Blanche.  Blanche.  Blanche.  I say it's Blanche.  Yeah.  Either call him Blanche or Blanche.  The bartender from The Love Boat.  This is a big get.  I'm going to mess up his first name.  Say Teed.  Teed.  Say Teed.  This is a big get for us, guys.  It is.  We've had some A-listers in here, but...  Hey, Bob!  I was going to make a joke.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  It's really sad when you know somebody so well. 
[02:25:00]  All they have to do is say that, and you have to go a few letters down.  Yes, of course.  It's the simplest thing.  Oh, fuck.  Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  Elijah is a good guy.  Yeah, we like Elijah.  I love him, yeah.  He goes with him, you know?  Yeah, he can talk about anything.  He's like a regular kind of dude.  He's been in the business so long.  He's like one of those, like, fucking, um, whatchacallit, uh, those, uh, Opie guys.  Not you, Opie.  Oh, fuck.  The other Opie.  I thought you were talking about me. 
[02:25:30]  Nah, the other Opie.  The Richie Cunningham Opie.  Like the, um...  Yeah.  How do I get rid of the Opie name?  Opie.  Do you think we could do it?  Oh, shit.  I don't want that name anymore.  You don't want it anymore?  No, I haven't wanted it for ten years.  We should have a big retirement of the name thing.  And then have the listeners pick a new name.  Oh, that'll be a good one.  God, a programmer right now is jerking off somewhere like, that's a great idea.  Oh, what a great idea that is.  I'm going to use that with my morning show.  Yes, yes.  Cowhead, uh, is doing something where he's retiring the name or something. 
[02:26:00]  What's happening?  I'm doing a roast for him.  Bob Kelly.  Is he retiring the name?  I don't know.  But we're roasting him in Tampa.  Yeah.  And fuck, I'm not going to repeat the line, but Bob Kelly last night told me one of his roast  jokes.  And it made me laugh so hard.  I wanted to fucking smash Bob with a chair.  Wow.  Is that good?  Yeah, it was really, really fucking funny.  Bob he's funny.  God damn it.  It annoyed me.  It was so good.  Oh, man.  Yes, Kenny.  Kenny?  That, uh, cowhead roast is for charity, too. 
[02:26:30]  They're supposed to send me the link so we can plug it.  Oh, okay.  And I'm doing the club the weekend after that.  Like, the next night and Saturday.  Only two nights.  But I'm happy to...  I just don't know this cowhead guy.  He's a fucking huge DJ.  Oh, I just don't know him.  Mr. Cowhead, he was just here to visit you.  I know.  Was he really?  Yes.  Yeah, we saw him the other day.  He took a photo with him.  Yeah, we saw him a couple weeks ago.  I thought he was just a listener.  No, I don't know.  Dude, he's been a good supporter.  Maybe introduce us next time.  I just remember Cowhead.  From Rockhole's intern. 
[02:27:00]  Dude, he was fucking on Bubba's station, and he was sticking up for us against Bubba on  his own station.  Oh, yeah?  He's like a friend of the show.  I'm sure he's a nice guy.  I just don't know.  Dude, all right.  Is he in a loose mood?  Show me a picture of the guy.  He's not handsome.  He's not handsome.  He's not a looker.  He's a name like Cowhead.  No, he's not a looker.  He can't be.  That guy.  I've met that guy.  That is a giant cow-like head.  It's Cowhead.  I've met him.  Yes.  Okay.  Multiple times.  He was here.  He took a picture with us. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, I remember.  Go to Cowhead's Twitter.  Okay.  He is a very good friend.  Cowhead's going to be very, very disappointed at this conversation.  We certainly like the people that like us.  I'll tell you that much right now.  I'm all about this Cowhead guy.  Look, guys that support us on Terrestrial Radio are fucking, are very, are very, uh, few  and far between, too.  And they're promoting us on Terrestrial Radio.  I have no problems with, uh, the Cowhead.  I want to ask him how he got his name.  How do you get a Cowhead name?  You know how he did it?  Is it as interesting as the sex bagel name? 
[02:28:00]  Who?  What?  Yeah.  There we are.  Look.  You're the one with the beard.  There's?  Wait, there's me, and that's Cowhead.  Yeah.  That's Cowhead.  Oh, I thought that guy won a contest to sit in and watch the show or something.  No.  Because those guys come through every once in a while.  I know how he got the name, by the way.  How?  It's the only way he can come.  Oh, shit.  See, because a cow would be sucking his dick.  Cows have big, long tongues.  They do.  You know how good a cow would suck your dick?  Yeah, but if he, once he does that grind thing with his molars, like he does on hay,  That would hurt.  No, you put fucking, like, teeth guards in there so he has to just suck it like it. 
[02:28:30]  God, a cow would bite your dick right off.  Well, okay.  You could probably fuck a cow's nostril.  They're pretty big.  Why would you when the vag or the anus is right back there?  That's true.  What's wrong with you?  All covered in that green shit.  Yeah, well, go ahead.  That slimy green cow shit.  That's twice I've given you a great scenario that you've spoiled.  Spoiled.  Where's this bartender guy?  He's not here yet.  Ted Lange? 
[02:29:00]  Ted Lange is on the way.  Roland said he's coming early.  That's why we're just bullshitting.  That's what Roland said.  Roland talks all kinds of shit.  Ted Lange will be here early.  Roland's a pile of crud.  He'll be here early.  So take him early.  So this cow head break wasn't planned?  He's a few blocks away.  Okay, that's fine.  A few blocks away?  So he'll probably be here on time.  What is that?  A nautical mile since he's on the low-toil?  You know, coincidentally...  How many knots away is he?  Nauts.  Sorry, Kenny.  It's all right.  Coincidentally, Mr. Cowhead is a big WWE fan, and they're a new sponsor to the show. 
[02:29:30]  I see.  Welcome to the WWE.  I was proud to do a read for the WWE.  You played sound effects over the whole thing.  Well, you did.  What?  That was a heel.  Yelling at the wrestlers.  WrestleMania's 30.  WrestleMania's 30, baby.  That's insane.  I remember WrestleMania 1.  Of course.  One.  Were they taking advantage of that?  It's triple X?  I mean, they have three X's, but they're not saying WrestleMania, triple...  It's a PG product.  Was WrestleMania 2 the one with Mr. T?  Yes.  He was at WrestleMania 1 and WrestleMania 2.  1 and 2. 
[02:30:00]  Right.  2 was the big one.  Mr. T was in the main event of 1 as well.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, but he...  Yeah.  2 is one.  He really shined.  You're just making that up.  Man.  All right.  That's who I am.  Hey, woman.  Ted Lang.  Nope.  Not yet.  Where is Ted Longier?  Ted Langie.  Rollins full of shit.  Yeah.  As long as we're talking about Cowhead, you know, he also has a band.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Pitbull Toddler.  I like that.  Yeah.  All right.  I like that.  Never heard the music, bud.  What type of... 
[02:30:30]  You don't know what type of music?  No.  I'm sure it's terrific.  Is it, like, blues?  Seems like everything this Cowhead does is terrific.  It is.  He's a great man.  Everything he touches.  He's on Afternoon Drive in Tampa.  He does a cruise every year, which, for some reason, his company helped him out with.  That'd be nice.  I wonder if you could get Isaac, the bartender, on that cruise.  I would like that.  Ted Langie.  Ted Langie.  Ted Langie.  Pew.  Your bartender points at you.  Speaking of music, by the way, I've gotten some CDs I have yet to hear from a friend of mine 
[02:31:00]  who I've mentioned on this very program.  You count me?  And he's a big man, very powerful and strong, who I knew in my childhood when I was 13.  Oh, oh, oh.  His younger brother.  Powerful how he could pin you down upside down?  No, no.  On your belly?  He wasn't a dirty boy like that.  He was a very nice man.  But he was...  Him and his younger brother were used to hang out with.  His younger brother wanted to throw hot mustard on a girl.  Oh, oh.  I've been back in touch with Stanley.  Stanley!  No!  Stanley! 
[02:31:30]  Fucking Stanley, the bodybuilder.  I met Stanley once.  You never met Stanley?  No, you didn't.  I haven't seen Stan in 30 years.  I meet a Jim Norton friend every once in a while at the Brigada.  Yeah?  You sure I didn't meet Stanley?  Oh, dude, I believe me.  Who did I meet last year?  Jake Stanley.  Yeah, let's throw some hot oil on him.  Hey, Stanley.  Stan was such a nice guy, he bends fucking steel.  That's what he does.  He's a power...  With his bare hands?  He's a fucking savage.  Who's that?  I was just doing the rest of the Superman little thing, preamble.  Oh! 
[02:32:00]  And who?  Yeah, he's just a nice guy.  Disguised as mild-mannered reporter.  Is it like older?  Yeah.  Quite a never-ending battle for truth, justice, and the American way.  They sure threw all that shit out with the new Superman.  Well, what would he do back then for the American way?  Would he throw out certain water fountains?  He'd make sure that they only eat at the designated counters.  That is a Superman.  Well, who did you meet last year?  One of my old friends, I guess. 
[02:32:30]  I don't know.  I thought it was Stanley.  I don't know.  There's another guy you've talked about a lot on our show.  I love when you bring up a name from the past and have his first and last name.  I love Stan.  I don't know why it makes me laugh.  Because it's almost like it's a movie or a book or something.  It makes it so personal or something.  Yeah, it's very personal.  By the way, Roland fucked us up.  He did.  He goes, you want Ted Lang early.  Now, officially, he's not early.  So why would he say you want him early?  We were in the mode now.  Right.  I mean, so we figured, all right, we'll shoot the shit for two minutes, and then the bartender 
[02:33:00]  guy comes in.  Yeah.  He'll be here on time.  When is he docking?  See, I didn't mean that way.  Imagine, like, tying up.  By the way, I felt like I had a tremendous lack of support on my show and movie ideas.  They were so bad.  Could you imagine something like that being put out?  You know what I say?  Get over it.  Get over it.  Get over it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Get over it.  Do you like the pitch in a fit line? 
[02:33:30]  Pitch in a fit.  Do you like that line?  That should not be in any song.  Not at all.  Pitch in a fit.  Exactly.  Unless you're playing fit ball.  Did you get it?  Yeah.  Of course you got it.  We got it, all right.  Valkyrie.  Oh, that Valkyrie song.  I think we've got to give that song another chance.  No, we don't.  Sure.  I think the B-side will have to give it a shot.  It's making out with a worse video.  Making out.  Oh, they're all. 
[02:34:00]  Listen to how fucking tinny and shitty this recording is.  What's the best part?  A Brady Bunch song, right?  Yeah.  From all.  Let's make it out.  Yeah.  Everyone?  Everyone.  Well.  Oh, not you.  Just mouth the lyrics.  Did you think about this role yesterday?  I got it out.  Disco.  How about get over it?  I hate both those songs. 
[02:34:30]  I hate when they talk about boobs, make them out.  Do you think that's funny?  That's so bad.  They're all dated.  Oh, Charo's making out, is she?  Yeah.  But there's no guarantee.  Oh.  Yeah, fucking.  Hemler.  Fucking gerbil.  Everyone is making out.  Blondie the dog.  Jesus.  Make it out.  LeVar Burton and Sandy Duncan better not be making out. 
[02:35:00]  Do you remember their movie roles?  Make it out.  Everyone.  Make it out.  Everyone, Jim?  Everyone?  Oh, apparently not.  Yes, this is still more topical than fucking Todd's song parody lyrics.  Oh.  I hear the zero Oakland Raiders.  Yeah.  Make it out.  What a horrible old reference. 
[02:35:30]  Charity Vader.  Why?  Jack's crap when he's not eating fat.  He is making out.  My.  Uh-oh.  I've even seen a Muppet that is making out.  Oh, my.  Yeah, it's Jim Henson, too.  Yeah.  With a penis.  He's checking out.  Checking out.  Checking out.  You. 
[02:36:00]  Oh.  Oh.  It's just cruelty on the shelf.  It's just a terrible show.  So.  Oh, now where's Ted Lang, the bartender?  He's making out.  Ted Lang and Gavin McLeod are making out.  That was officially late.  What was Roland talking about?  I want to hear more names, by the way, Roland.  No, no, no. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, no, no.  Making out.  Somebody's on his way.  Oh, yeah?  Is he disembarking?  Checking out.  Checking out.  Checking out.  Checking out.  No, not everyone.  No?  Oh.  Are there any funny names?  Yeah.  Harold Ramis is checking out.  Now watch it bunker out of shape is making out. 
[02:37:00]  Sid Caesar and John Ritter are checking out.  King Kong when he is going apid is making out.  King Kong.  Here we go, guys.  Swear.  Here we go.  All right.  Oh, you're going to get it.  It's the second that fucking door opens.  He's going to point.  I know it.  And I'm going to yell yuck really loud.  Yes.  Here he comes.  I'm going to be codependent.  Here he comes.  Ted Lang point.  Ted.  Ted.  Hi, Ted.  Here he comes.  Oh, there he is. 
[02:37:30]  How you doing, Ted?  Hello.  Oh, wow.  Ted Lang.  Do it.  It's slams.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  You know what to do.  Do it.  He's got to be so tired of pointing at people.  You're not going to point?  Enough pointing at people.  Oh, we want to point.  Yeah.  You've got to say that.  Yes.  He's just said do it.  Pointing at people.  I thought there was a girl that was going to come in.  Oh, we could do that, too.  Ted.  That'd be nice. 
[02:38:00]  You're tick-tipped over, Mr. Lange.  It felt...  Lange?  Okay.  Thank you.  A lot of people just say Lange all the time.  All the time.  For years they've been saying that.  Yes, they have.  Yeah.  Hope Lange said it that way, too.  And I said, wait a minute, baby.  Hope Lange.  Yeah, yeah.  She was on an episode of The Love Book.  And Jim Lange, yeah.  And Jim Lange.  He wasn't on, but I did the dating game when I was a kid.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Oh, you did?  Did you get picked?  Yes.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, I went to Ireland on St. Patrick's Day.  Geez. 
[02:38:30]  From here, or that's where the dating game was played?  No, the dating game was played in Los Angeles.  Los Angeles.  Yes.  California.  We're going to Ireland.  In the 60s.  Wow.  This was in the 60s.  That's crazy.  And the girl was a very nice girl.  Yeah?  Did you get anything?  She was very nice to me.  Oh, with her chaperone?  In Dublin.  In Dublin.  She wasn't so nice in Limerick.  By the time we got to Dublin, she was very nice to me.  Oh, okay.  Did you get a little something-something?  I just met a nice girl.  I don't kiss and tell. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, man.  We really did it.  They bring those...  You got to bring a chaperone with you, right?  Yeah.  The chaperone was a lady named Mrs. McDermott.  And Mrs. McDermott...  Ooh, she sounds like a prude.  Yeah.  She doesn't sound like she's unfundered.  Did you please put your cheeks?  No.  She was Chuck...  She was Chuck Barris' babysitter.  Wow.  Whoa.  Okay.  And either she was Scottish or Irish or something, so she wanted to go to the Emerald Isle.  Aye.  She went there.  She drank a lot of...  What is that?  Whiskey?  Oh, uh-huh.  And so...  Not much of a chaperone. 
[02:39:30]  After a certain point.  Oh, that's good.  She kind of...  That's great.  She was face down in the comforter while you and your date were going at it.  Good for you.  Good for Ted.  Wow.  That's pretty cool.  But how did you get a date to fly you to Ireland?  Like, that's a weird dating game.  Don't they just send you out for like a little local thing?  Well, no.  At that time, it was...  They had a nighttime version.  I did the daytime version and lost, but they liked the way I played the game.  Oh, okay.  So then I did a nighttime version and Dick Martin was on. 
[02:40:00]  I remember that these...  We were all the guys in the green room.  I said, wow, that guy's really cool.  It was Dick Martin.  Dick Martin was...  From Ronan Martin.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he was another one of the contestants?  He was another one.  No, he chose.  Oh, okay.  He chose the dates.  And I was with these three guys.  I mean, two other guys.  Uh-huh.  We were on one show.  He was on another show.  I think Desi Arnaz Jr. was on another show.  Wow.  Yeah.  And so I was like, wow, man, look at this.  And then years later, I worked with him on Love Boat, Dick Martin. 
[02:40:30]  Right, right.  And I reminded him of the incident.  Of that whole thing?  Can you remember?  Oh, yeah, he remembered the show.  Me?  Not so much.  Not so much.  Now, this was back in the 60s?  Yeah, 68.  So now, obviously, it had to have been two other black guys and a black girl.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  They were playing that other game.  What the hell do they think they're doing?  What the hell is going on?  Yeah. 
[02:41:00]  It was the actress from A Patch of Blue.  She's blind.  She can't see her.  Selina.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why did you think of that?  Yeah, yeah.  Back then, it was...  Yeah.  Nice.  Oh, hell, that was true on a love boat.  On a limits.  When a black girl got on a love boat, you knew whose love story it was.  You knew Billy Dee Williams was coming on.  Yeah, that's right.  That's pretty much all they used.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that's how that went, you know?  Wow, that is amazing, you know?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That love boat was pretty successful there, Ted.  My God.  Wow. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, we would get 70 million viewers on our premiere show.  Look at Jimmy's eyes.  That's unheard of.  You can't do that now.  Millions viewers.  70 million on a premiere show or Sweeps Weeks, you know?  You forget how huge that show was.  I mean, people would just...  Yeah, it was crazy.  Wait, what does that mean for you, though?  You just couldn't even leave your house if 70 million eyes are on you.  You know what?  What's interesting is that now the people that grew up with the show remember the show, 
[02:42:00]  and they have children, and I'll walk somewhere, like go to see a movie or something, and the  father goes crazy, and the kid's going, Dad.  Yeah.  It's just some black guy.  What are you doing?  Who's this guy?  That's Isaac.  That's...  Dad, cut it out.  You're embarrassing me, you know?  We're playing episodes, though, on like MeTV and AntennaTV.  Like there's a few networks now that just play shows from the 70s and 80s and whatnot.  Yeah.  And yeah, I was just actually just watching an episode the other day with Sonny Bono. 
[02:42:30]  Sonny Bono.  Who played the guy who slipped and tried to sue the boat.  Yeah.  He and I hung out.  Yeah?  How was Sonny?  He was really cool.  Yeah.  He told me stories about him and Cher and Phil Spector working.  He was a gopher for Phil Spector.  Really?  This is what he told me.  He was a gopher for Phil Spector.  Spector didn't want to hire him.  And he said, I'll work for free.  Wow.  Yeah.  He said, you work for free?  He said, yeah.  Because he wanted to learn how to be a music producer. 
[02:43:00]  Mm-hmm.  So he works.  He goes and he gets hamburgers, cheeseburgers, all of that stuff.  Whatever kind of grunt work they wanted to do, he would go do it.  Wow.  And he said he saw this girl, 16 or whatever, in singing background.  And he said to Phil, how come you don't let her do a lead?  You're letting Darlene Love and Ronnie do...  He said, Phil's like, that girl can't sing.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah, she's not a singer.  We'll keep her in the background.  So then Sonny learned how to write songs by hanging with Phil and those guys. 
[02:43:30]  And he wrote a song for him and Cher.  Wow.  It wasn't like, I got you, babe.  Was that the first one that you wrote?  Yeah, I think that is.  Is it?  Yeah, it might be.  Yeah, I think it is.  Wow.  I should know that.  I'm not supposed to know that.  You should know that.  Ah, hell no.  Who's on the computer?  Look it up.  Come on.  It is something, because you've hung out, because of The Love Boat, with so many people  from so many different areas of entertainment.  Great, great.  It was such a wonderful opportunity to kind of pay your dues. 
[02:44:00]  And while you're paying your dues, you're meeting the old timers that are giving you advice  on what to do, what not to do.  Yeah, yeah.  Did you hang out with Gene Kelly?  Yes.  You did?  Yes.  Gene Kelly came to Hong Kong with Yvette Mimou.  I don't know if you remember Yvette.  Yvette Mimou.  Yes.  Yvette Mimou.  Yes.  Yvette Mimou.  Yes.  She was a gorgeous, gorgeous lady.  Was she an actress or a model? 
[02:44:30]  She was an actress.  She was an actress.  Where do we know her from?  I don't know.  Some movies are in the early 60s.  The Mimou Follies.  Yeah, yeah.  Might have to look that one up.  Yeah.  But you hung out with Gene Kelly.  That's pretty cool.  So I bought Gene Kelly.  He was cranky and he didn't like a lot of people, but for whatever reason he liked me.  So we kind of hung out a little bit.  And so he says, hey, well, why don't we go have a drink at the hotel, blah, blah, blah.  So I said, okay, cool.  So we go to the hotel and we're drinking and I'm asking him about the Nicholas brothers 
[02:45:00]  and singing in the rain and stuff like that.  He says, listen, my girlfriend, her name is Sandy.  She's going to come down here.  Do not talk about music.  I said, well, why?  He says, well, if you talk about music, you're going to talk about singers.  If you talk about singers, somebody may say Tony Bennett.  Uh-oh.  She was married to Tony Bennett and she's still a little bit upset about the divorce.  And so don't say anything, okay? 
[02:45:30]  I said, okay, cool.  She comes down and I want to say, I left my heart in San Francisco so bad, you know.  And then all the Tony Bennett songs just pop into your brain because the guy said, don't  do anything.  That's all you can think about.  Yeah, that's all I can think about.  So at the end of the deal, I said, he wanted to buy me the drinks.  I said, no, no, you don't.  I'll buy.  And he says, no, no, no.  I'm going to buy them.  I said, no, no, because I want to be able to tell my kids that when I was in Hong Kong,  I bought Gene Kelly drinks. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  Why did you say he was cranky?  Was he being shitty to other people in Hong Kong?  Well, he was cranky.  You know, he was just, I wouldn't say he was being shitty.  He was just being a little bit persnickety.  You know what I mean?  It's like, we're ready for you.  Okay.  Yeah.  Well, wait a minute.  I got to get my thing on.  That kind of thing.  Just being Gene Kelly.  Yeah.  Well, you know, I mean, he was a big dude.  And sometimes, particularly in his career, some people don't treat other people with respect. 
[02:46:30]  And so, if you didn't do that, he was very, wait a minute.  I'm going to be there, but this is how this works.  Because he's an old pro.  I remember him telling me, he says, Ted, he says, Entertainment Tonight, don't do that show.  I said, why?  He says, they don't pay.  He says, they want everything for free.  He says, you're worth money, make them pay you the money.  But he's probably from that. 
[02:47:00]  That's pretty smart.  He was from that era, though, where like.  Yeah, that's true.  He didn't show your face unless you cut a check.  Yeah.  He's going to say when you're a movie star.  Right.  To not do, but he didn't get paid when he did The Tonight Show, did he?  Other than maybe scale.  That was a lot of self-promotion.  He was getting paid.  His whole thing was, don't do anything for free.  Mickey Rooney was the same way.  Mickey Rooney was pissed at Ronald Reagan because Ronald Reagan was the president of SAG.  Right.  And he sold out all the actors to the studios for residuals. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, wow.  And he did all those Andy Hardy movies.  Right.  Right.  So if you said, hey, you getting any residuals?  Oh, man.  This guy went into a rage.  Son of a bitch, Ronnie Reagan.  You know, because he did all the movies.  And so he said, he went to MGM.  He said, say, you know, you owe me some money for this because you're rerunning this show.  He said, we don't owe you for anything.  Talk to Ronnie Reagan.  Yeah.  You know, we own the thing. 
[02:48:00]  And he says, yes, but you're using the name Mickey Rooney to get people to watch.  He says, well, you know, it's not on us.  It's on the TV stations.  They're paying us.  He says, well, look, I won't ask for any money if you give it to them for free.  Give it to the TV stations for free, then we both make nothing.  Yeah.  But if you make something, you should pay me.  And he didn't win that argument.  No, I guess not.  They're never going to go, that's a great point.  We should give you some of our money.  Here you go.  Here's some money. 
[02:48:30]  With that said, do you make money off the love boat still?  Yeah.  You do.  I'm probably, with me TV, I'll make maybe 35 cents this year.  All right.  I mean, it's down.  I mean, you know.  Over the years, it goes down and down.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Much like the Pacific Princess.  Wow.  That went down, didn't it?  Did you see that picture?  Did that make you cry?  It was on its side.  Yeah.  It's got to be a little sad.  Everybody sent me, they Facebooked me that picture.  Yeah.  They sent me that picture.  Of course.  They want to rub it in. 
[02:49:00]  Well, no, I mean, you know.  Not nice people there, Ted.  Well, you know.  How much time did you actually spend on the boat?  I mean, it was the exterior shots, I would gather.  Yeah, what we did was, we did, once a year, we would go out on the boat, and let's say  the boat was in Hong Kong, or, you know, in the Asian...  That's where King Kong played ping pong with his ding dong, apparently.  I remember that.  Hong Kong.  Yes, in Hong Kong.  He was Hong Kong.  Oh, we would always go there.  Yeah, yeah.  To play ping pong with his ding dong.  Yes, he was notoriously big. 
[02:49:30]  Yes, Ted.  So we went out on the ship once a year.  Once a year, we'd do three specials.  Okay.  The two-hour specials.  So if we were in Hong Kong, we'd do Hong Kong, Japan, and then Beijing.  How long would you be out for?  Six weeks.  So two weeks per special, really?  Yeah.  Wow.  Would you fly celebrities in to do their episodes?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  You had to stay in the boat for six weeks.  Well, no, you'd go into Hong Kong.  Oh, yeah, you would go into port or whatever, right? 
[02:50:00]  Yeah.  As a matter of fact, I have a story in that we were making so much money.  Are you being sarcastic, or you really were?  No, no, we were making great theft, though.  It was good money.  Spelling paid his actors.  I remember Steven Bochco, who did the Hill Street shows, they didn't pay the actors, but  they had better writing.  But our show, the writing wasn't as strong as that, but we were paid royally.  What was considered in that day?  Sorry to interrupt you.  What was considered in that day good? 
[02:50:30]  Because now you hear like 35,000, 40,000 an episode.  In that day, what was considered good?  Because I remember hearing Larry Hagman as JR made 250,000 an episode back in the set,  which was...  That's phenomenal.  That's huge.  But he was the show.  Right, right.  He was the whole franchise.  I mean, you couldn't be Sue Ellen and ask for that kind of money.  Right.  No, we'll divorce you, bitch.  You know, I mean, you're out of here.  But we're keeping this guy.  What was considered good money then back in the day?  30,000.  Wow. 
[02:51:00]  30 grand an episode.  The 70s?  Yeah, yeah.  That's good money.  That's well more than a year's salary for a lot of people.  That's a lot of money.  Especially back then.  Yeah, back then.  So I told the producers, I said, listen, I want to have a suite when we get to Hong Kong  because we've got these little rooms on a boat.  We're going to be in a hotel.  I want a suite.  They said, well, what the hell do you think?  Who do you think you are?  You're not Gavin.  You're not the star.  We're not going to pay for you to have a suite.  I said, I didn't ask you to pay for me to have a suite. 
[02:51:30]  I asked you to book me a suite.  Because what they would do is they'd book you a little room, you know, in a hotel.  And so I said, just book whatever you're going to pay for the little room, pay.  And then I'll pay the balance.  Okay?  So they said, oh, oh, all right.  So we got to Hong Kong.  So we did some stuff on a boat.  We get to Hong Kong.  We're going to spend a week in Hong Kong.  I call up the cast, Gavin and Bernie and Fred Grandy.  And I say, hey, why don't you guys come down to my room and we'll have a drink before 
[02:52:00]  we go to the restaurant.  They thought I had one of those little refrigerators with the little.  A little mini bar.  Yeah.  I had a suite that was on a corner that looked at one side of Hong Kong and another side.  I had a full bar with, you know, decanters full of alcohol.  Yeah.  You know, I had a sitting room and all just television, a huge two person bath, you know,  and just gorgeous.  So they walked into my room and they look around and go, what the? 
[02:52:30]  Oh my God.  They thought they put you up there.  Yeah.  Okay.  So they're like, what the fuck?  Hey man, I got a little room here and Ted has this huge suite.  They said, well, what are you doing?  What do you, how did this happen?  I said, what do you mean?  They said, well, you, you got this suite.  I said, well, everybody got a suite.  Oh man.  They said, no, we didn't get a suite.  I said, oh, come on.  You know, you guys got a suite, don't they?  They said, no, we didn't get a suite.  I said, do you think they give the black guy a suite and I give you guys a suite? 
[02:53:00]  They go, no, no, they didn't give us a suite.  So Fred Grandy, who Fred and I were always in friendly competition.  So Fred calls up his manager and says, hey, listen, Ted Lange got a suite and I want  a suite.  What an asshole.  That's great.  I want a suite just like Ted Lange.  So his agent gets back to him and says, Ted paid for that suite.  He said, what?  Yeah, he's not, the company did not give him the suite.  Ted paid for the suite. 
[02:53:30]  So Fred comes up to me later, you know, we're running around doing something.  He says, oh, I know what you did.  I said, what?  He said, you paid for the suite.  I said, is that what they told you?  He said, yeah, you paid for the suite.  I said, well, if that's what they told you, yeah, I paid for the suite.  But, you know, it didn't cost me no money, Fred, really.  How much was the difference between what the buyout was?  How much did you have to pay a night for the place?  Do you remember?  No.  How am I going to remember that?  Good question.  You're right.  I was making $30,000 a week. 
[02:54:00]  You're right.  That was the appropriate response to that asshole question.  You know, I keep track of all the money I made back in the 70s.  Did you ever have to deal with any of those viruses on the boats during the years where,  you know, you hear nowadays the whole ship gets diarrhea?  Yeah.  You know, no.  When we were doing it, the only thing you had to deal with is overeating.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, they would, like, if you sat down at a table and you said caviar, and I kind  of think the waiters loved doing this. 
[02:54:30]  What they would do is they would heap on the food, you know, and then they'd sit back,  take bets who was going to get sick.  You know what I mean?  From eating too much caviar, you know, or eating too many steaks or whatever.  That was the big deal then.  You guys must have, when you went out like that, obviously they don't allow the public  on there.  No, they did!  So you actually shot on the ship when there were passengers. </pre>
