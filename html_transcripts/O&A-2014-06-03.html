<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, frequently interrupted by significant and prolonged technical difficulties, primarily revolving around Anthony's microphone and headphones, the studio phone lines, and a malfunctioning computer mouse.  The show began with a discussion of the Casey Kasem family legal battles, specifically the alleged meat-throwing incident, followed by a comical account of a near-miss plane crash into a beach.  Speculation on Obama's hair color ensued, jokingly suggesting chlorine as a possible lightening agent.

A substantial segment focused on Jonah Hill's use of a homophobic slur towards a paparazzi photographer, with the hosts playing audio of the incident and debating its context.  They also critiqued TMZ's perceived bias in reporting on celebrity reactions to paparazzi.  This was followed by a discussion of moon landing conspiracy theories, triggered by a caller's question about the filming of Neil Armstrong's first steps.  The hosts dismissed the conspiracy and recounted Buzz Aldrin punching a conspiracy theorist.  The show also covered MSNBC's apology for misidentifying the actress who played Alice in *The Brady Bunch Movie* in their reporting of Ann B. Davis's death, and criticized John Stamos's insensitive tweet about Davis.  The possibility of interviewing Jonah Hill, who was reportedly in the building, was briefly discussed, along with the scheduling complications due to his appearance on Howard Stern's show.  Upcoming guests Jim Norton and Jim Florentine were also mentioned.

An interview with Jack Lloyd, the former child actor who played young Anakin Skywalker, was conducted amidst escalating technical problems.  Lloyd discussed his post-*Star Wars* career and experiences at fan conventions, with the hosts speculating on the reasons for his perceived bitterness.  The technical difficulties, involving numerous attempts by engineer Mars and staff member Donnie Wicklund to fix Anthony's equipment, became a major focus of the segment.  These issues included a broken wireless mouse, which Anthony threw across the studio in anger, and the subsequent introduction of a cumbersome, old wired mouse and the associated adapter chaos.  Interspersed with the technical mayhem were brief discussions of Aaron Lewis (of Staind) stopping a concert to reprimand fans for groping a young girl, and Dan Marino's lawsuit against the NFL over concussions. A caller, Frankie from the Bronx, added to the Dan Marino story.

The technical problems continued throughout the show, frequently interrupting conversations and leading to comedic exchanges among the hosts and Mars, who was frequently the target of their frustration.  Discussions about refurbished items (including a vulgar joke about a refurbished vagina), a caller, Patrick, from a Navajo reservation, and the various attempts to fix the equipment ("third baseman pitching") provided comedic relief amid the technical chaos.  Further tangents included Dan Marino's on-air meltdown, Terrell Buckley's similar experience, quirky baseball fans, Billy Crystal's appearance, a controversial prisoner exchange, and E-Rockâ€™s food reviews (SpaghettiOs with taco sauce, various Doritos flavors, and adult Capri Suns potentially concealing alcohol).

A significant portion of the show featured a phone call with "Lady Di," characterized by a contentious and rambling conversation.  The hosts challenged her statements about drug use and ATM visits near a previous mugging location. The conversation then spiraled into increasingly absurd territory, covering her limited Broadway show attendance and her movie preferences (primarily 70s and 80s films), punctuated by insults and interruptions.  The hosts repeatedly attempted to get her partner, "Bill," on the phone, using increasingly vulgar language.  The conversation was further interrupted by another caller, who forgot the reason for their call after listening to Lady Di for ten minutes.  A potential future project involving Lady Di and Colin Quinn was deemed a "dumb idea".  The segment ended abruptly with Lady Di still on the phone.  Throughout the broadcast, the technical difficulties provided a chaotic and recurring backdrop to the various discussions.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And we're off and running. Good morning, everybody.  Tuesday, right?  And then we get right on the road.  Yeah, that's what we're doing.  Well, that shit works.  We just did this yesterday. We had a good show.  I remember that.  Now we gotta have another good show.  They demand it.  These fuckers demand it.  They just keep coming every day.  Casey can go home to life if doctors okay it.  Alright.  Oh, my God.  The Casey Kasem saga continues.  Is that a picture of him being wheeled around? 
[00:00:30]  Oh, great.  That wife of his.  She's throwing hamburger.  She's got beef.  Kasem's wife throws meat at stepdaughter.  Yeah.  What?  Okay, well, the two have been locked in a major legal battle.  She's saying some kind of thing like she's a devil and feed the fucking rabid dogs.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah. So she threw meat.  You see this?  Wow, that's fucking.  Oh, my God. 
[00:01:00]  Did that fucker almost get run over by a plane?  I think that's in Germany.  What is that?  A little Cessna?  Yeah, a little Piper.  A little Piper.  And there's a guy just sunbathing.  His head is down.  And this plane misses him.  That is less than a foot over his back.  And then I hear the plane crashed into a fence to get to a landing strip.  Yeah, you could see it hit some posts right there.  And the guy in the beach had no idea, had no clue. 
[00:01:30]  A plane missed him by probably eight inches.  And then the pilot was fine, too, after he crashed through the fence.  I didn't know they had video of that.  That is amazing.  That is pretty goddamn amazing.  I saw the still in the paper today, but that's a great video.  No one's going to beat that one today.  How come we didn't just go to the runway?  Why do they have to show off and go to the beach?  He probably did it on purpose.  I think he did.  Yeah, they heard him say, watch how close I can come to this guy's back.  Fuck. 
[00:02:00]  Fly by.  A little fly by.  Yeah.  What were we just talking about?  Oh, Casey Kasem?  Casey Kasem.  What were we talking about before that?  That it's Tuesday?  That it's Tuesday.  We were talking before the mics went on about Obama's sun in hair.  It looks like he's got.  Yeah, it looks like he, I don't know.  It looks like he has blonde hair right now.  Yeah.  And the rest of the colors in the video that we just saw looked normal,  so I don't know what's going on with his hair. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  That guy went gray in office.  My God.  It looked like his gray hair was, like, blonde now.  Maybe he was hanging out in a pool.  Maybe that.  We had a kid in high school.  I know her name, too, and I just can't say her name.  But she had green.  That was only a couple of years ago.  Thank you, Anthony.  She had green hair in high school.  Green.  And it was because of the pool.  So she had blonde, was it blonde hair?  Very blonde hair.  Yeah.  If you have very blonde hair, you've got to be careful. 
[00:03:00]  Well, back in the day, I don't know, maybe the chemicals are better now.  I think the chemicals, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  And she had a very, a tint of green in her hair always.  Yeah, that chlorine will fuck you up.  It will, right?  Yeah.  So maybe that's what happened to Obama.  Back in the old days, people just used to toss a fuckload of chlorine in their pool.  Yeah.  Now I guess it's a little better.  Whatever.  War with your green hair.  I want to start with our pal Jonah Hill.  Yeah, I just heard this story.  We had a little beef with Jonah Hill, but in the end, I like Jonah Hill a lot. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  I really do.  And I think he's an amazing actor.  You liked that Wolf of Wall Street thing?  I thought he was amazing in that.  I thought that was his best role to date.  I thought he was better in that than Moneyball.  Moneyball.  Moneyball, he played more himself.  Moneyballs.  But Wolf of Wall Street, that was an amazing character he played.  Yeah, it was pretty good.  So I guess, oh, there it is.  You got it.  He told some photographer to suck my dick, faggot. 
[00:04:00]  Uh-oh.  And TMZ is waiting to see what Jonah Hill's going to do about this.  We called his representatives, and they didn't call us back yet.  We're waiting.  Didn't Alec Baldwin do the same exact thing and get fucking all kinds of grief?  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  You can't say suck my dick, faggot, even if you're really pissed off because someone's bothering you.  Yes.  It's funny how TMZ doesn't question their own desire to go after guys like this and get these private moments and hassle people.  That's not brought into question.  It's just how you respond to their harassment. 
[00:04:30]  Of course.  They're bullshit.  Hey, don't respond to our harassment by saying impolite things.  Yeah, we did all this, but ignore that part of it.  Jonah Hill was just trying to, I don't know, he's walking around.  He's got some flowery type, I don't know, shorts on, maybe a bathing suit.  Oh.  And they just harass him to the point where he turns around and goes, suck my dick, faggot.  And that's what guys and girls do when they're pissed off.  They come up with some very mean shit.  But, and that's, you know, it's politically incorrect to say that now. 
[00:05:00]  But as far as being the meanest thing you could say, it really isn't.  Guys used to call their buddies faggot all the time.  Right.  You know, don't be a faggot.  You're a faggot.  I want to correct Anthony.  I'm a faggot.  I think I'm a chlorine thing.  Do you want to deal with the green hair and chlorine thing?  Hold on a minute.  We've already moved on.  Of course we're wrong.  Ray, go ahead.  What do you mean, deal with it?  The green hair is dealt with because you've got copper and an algaecide, which mixes with 
[00:05:30]  the chemicals and blonde hair bleach.  Pow, pow!  That's been disproven, by the way.  That was thought of for years and that has been disproven.  I put a shitload of pouring in my pool all the time.  Nobody's hair turns green.  Ever.  So why did it turn green in the old days?  Because it was stupid.  No.  Because of what Ann said.  So why are you correcting them?  Where people just threw a shitload of chlorine in their pool.  It would make your eyes burn and blonde hair girls would get green fucking hair. 
[00:06:00]  All right.  So what?  It's officially some kind of chemical reaction?  I'm going insane.  It's fucking chlorine.  Whatever.  All right.  And I'm saying that guy, last call, was an asshole.  Thank you.  He was.  And he didn't even correct me when I said it.  It's been disproven.  I have no idea what I'm talking about.  Exactly.  You don't.  Sammy, let's play the video of Jonah Hill calling some guy a faggot.  Look, he's just been with Shane and Bro.  He won't leave him alone.  You're such a cool guy, man. 
[00:06:30]  I like the shorts, though, bro.  They are pretty sexy.  Give me a little stop.  Come on, man.  We're going to come here.  Well, if you change your mind, it'll still be the same, I'm sure, if you decide to come  back.  Have a good day. 
[00:07:00]  Enjoy.  Suck my dick.  Oh, a real bully.  A real bully.  A real bully.  Using the keyword bully.  A real bully.  He was chasing him and he even ran. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, to get in front of him.  To get in front of him and everything.  Yeah.  Well, look at that.  That's the big headline in giant letters.  Suck my D, star, star, star, star, F, star, star, star, fucking vultures.  Why don't they have the balls to at least write it out?  Right.  Yeah.  TMZ.  Yeah.  Write out, suck my dick faggot, because that's what he said.  A real bully.  A real bully.  I've been chasing you and harassing you and then you call me out on it.  You're a bully.  Amazing, right?  I don't like the, you should control your anger and say only things that I find to prove it. 
[00:08:00]  Right.  They got their pictures.  He didn't feel like answering those silly fucking questions that most of those guys ask  the celebrities.  He didn't feel like playing.  Jesus.  And so he didn't feel like playing.  You continued following him to the point you pissed him off.  And then when you're pissed off, you say shitty things.  That's how, that's how it works.  Yeah.  What do you think?  So what does the article say in there, Sam?  What do you think?  Does he, does he have to fucking grovel? 
[00:08:30]  Oh, he'll probably do.  Does he have to take sensitivity training and meet with the GLB fucking TSFU fucking?  Uh, well, the last line is, we called his representative for comment, but so far, haven't heard back.  L-P-G-T-S-F.  But they do admit Jonah Hill got fed up with a photographer's comments about his outfit and  lashed out by hurling a gay slur at him, yelling, suck my D-U-F. 
[00:09:00]  That's how TMZ works.  I know, but children, they write it, suck my D-U-F.  What, would TMZ get in trouble if they wrote out, suck my dick, faggot?  Probably.  They don't use any language that's harsh.  It's really weird.  They block it all.  I guess they want to get on more sites.  They want to be able to be on TV.  It's all about them furthering what they're doing.  Hill was out in the, uh, I can't, it's too far away, Sam.  He was out in L.A.  Right.  Okay.  Uh, and the paparazzi started asking questions. 
[00:09:30]  Right.  Okay.  Hill kept silent.  Right.  Because he didn't want to answer those silly questions.  You're not going to get every celebrity to answer your silly questions.  So take your pictures, get your little video, and move on.  Oh, they said he kept silent even when one of the guys, not from TMZ, mocked his floral  print board shorts, saying, I like your shorts though, bro.  They are pretty sexy.  All right.  All right.  And then the photog.  The photog followed Hill for another 40 seconds or so before wishing him a good day, and that's  when an obviously angry and frustrated Hill uncorked the homophobic slur. 
[00:10:00]  Uncorked.  Like he had been dying to say it.  Yes.  That's the guy who called him a bully?  The guy who was following him for 40 more seconds?  Yes.  Jerk off.  When pretty much everyone else left him alone because they got their shit.  He actually turned a corner.  Yeah.  You know, when you kind of turn that corner, it's over.  Yeah.  But not for this guy, because he knew he might get Jonah Hill to say something nasty.  And this is what they love.  They love when you snap.  Uh-huh.  So sick.  Real bully.  Well.  Real bully.  Real bully.  Sorry.  We completely support Jonah Hill calling him a faggot. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  He's angry and glassed out.  Fuck that guy.  Whatever.  That's what happens.  People say naughty, naughty things when they're mad.  Just happens.  And then we have to make believe that doesn't happen, right?  We got to make believe it doesn't happen.  We all have to make believe it doesn't happen.  Everybody has to be very contrite.  Completely.  You got to beg forgiveness to whatever group you just artificially insulted.  So how does this play out?  He's going to apologize.  He's going to have to say something.  He's a big star.  He's got to apologize. 
[00:11:00]  No.  Don't.  He's going to have to apologize.  No.  Don't do it, Jonah.  He will.  Christ.  There's nothing in it for him not to.  Yeah.  There's no advantage to him not to because he's just an actor and it's not like he goes  around saying this stuff and bitching about people who have to apologize.  So he'll just go like, hey, sorry about that.  I got angry.  Right.  And people go, all right.  There won't be any problem for him.  The fact that he has to in the first place is ridiculous.  If you're bothered, what are you supposed to say?  Buzz off, pal. 
[00:11:30]  You think of really mean shit, right?  Like the good old days and just pop them right in the fucking face.  Oh, you're not allowed to do that.  He shoved that lens right up his ass like fucking Sean Penn back in the day.  Good old Sean Penn.  Sean Penn.  He's a supreme asshole, but he could handle those motherfuckers.  Don't forget about Buzz Aldrin.  So, Buzz, you faked the moon landing.  Why don't you pop?  That's how you handle that. 
[00:12:00]  An old codger's fist right in your face.  Buzz is a dick if you're nice to him.  He's a dick.  Yes.  He's just not a nice guy.  We're on our best behavior when he comes in here.  Oh, he's still a dick.  He's a bit ornery.  He is ornery.  He's very ornery.  That's not dilly-dally.  I've got to get over to CNN.  Is that what he said?  Oh, he told me I was dilly-dally.  Sorry, shithead.  I was trying to ask you a question about your dumb fucking project.  You dilly-dally, Jimmy.  You know what would have happened if he would have dilly-dallied at some point? 
[00:12:30]  There'd be skeletons on the moon.  Right.  Look, I was a long time ago because you could see the giant cameras they're walking around with.  How's it going?  Do you remember me?  What's your name?  Park.  Park Sibrel.  Would you give your name to my assistant?  Yeah, I got one for you, one for your lawyer to sue me.  That's right.  I hope you do.  I'd love to go to court and show them a window shot.  I know you'd like to get a lot of attention, wouldn't you?  Well, you're the one getting money for something you didn't do. 
[00:13:00]  You're getting a lecture for walking on the moon when you didn't.  Well, that's called being a thief.  That's called being a thief.  Do you think you can get to heaven without repenting?  What?  What is this?  Why don't you swear on the Bible that you walked on the moon?  Please.  You're harassing this guy.  What a jerk-off.  Why don't you swear on the Bible that you walked on the moon?  I'm just jerk-off.  I'm not trying to get to the middle of the day.  Can you tell him to get out of here?  This is a hotel.  We'll call the police.  We can't solicit.  We paid. 
[00:13:30]  Come on in here.  We'll call the police.  Why don't you swear on the Bible that you walked on the moon?  It doesn't, sir.  I have nothing to do with this.  Okay.  We can't solicit on this property.  We just paid to rent out the penthouse to shoot up there.  So.  What a dick.  Yeah, Mark's a symbol.  You got to keep cheating, man.  I have.  Okay.  Well, you can put on your shoulder.  Don't be shy.  Just come with me, man.  You really like it.  You're the one who said you walked on the moon when you didn't. 
[00:14:00]  And the moon.  Call the kettle black if ever thought of it.  Say that misrepresentant.  You're a coward and a liar and a...  Right in the fucking face.  He fucking punched him in the face.  Good for Buzz Aldrin.  Right in his fucking...  I love it.  And look at his left foot lifts up.  He gave a good sock.  He gave a good sock.  He gave a fucking punch him good.  Who is that guy?  Mark Simms.  I think that guy has apologized to Buzz for that.  Like, I don't know what his thing was.  Right.  But I think that he has said that he was...  Some kind of preacher from where?  I don't know anything about him. 
[00:14:30]  He's one of those conspiracy guys, I think.  I don't know much about me.  I'm almost positive he has apologized.  Nice.  If you're one of those, we didn't land on the moon people, you really are a fucking blithering idiot.  Absolute asshole.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Prove it.  Yeah.  Prove it.  Yeah.  Prove that we were there.  You can see the shit on the moon.  You can see it.  Oh, yeah.  Through a telescope?  Yes.  Through telescopes, you can see the shit.  Wow.  Several.  Yeah.  How cool is that?  It's there.  Have you ever seen it through a telescope?  No, I don't have those kind of telescopes. 
[00:15:00]  You're just repeating something.  I assume that through all the evidence that has been presented, there's no way you can  fucking say that we haven't walked on the moon and not look like a dummy.  It's amazing.  All those people.  What did that guy expect?  He kept harassing him, harassing him.  Buzz Aldrin tried to go that way.  Then he went this way. 
[00:15:30]  Then he turned around and went back this way.  Yeah.  And he turned around.  I mean.  Talk about avoiding a confrontation.  He was trying to.  The guy got right.  And then he warned him.  He goes, you get out of my face.  The guy was absolutely a threat.  And Buzz socked him one.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Did he?  That was a good punch.  Yeah.  He just couldn't take it anymore.  That guy didn't see that coming.  No.  Well, it leads to today's apology.  Oh.  Trying to go 10 days without an apology on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:16:00]  Ain't gonna happen.  We need a stinger.  We need a promo.  We need some kind of production piece for this.  This is a, you know, kind of a lame one, to be honest with you.  But, you know, MSNBC confuses its famous housekeepers while reporting Ann B. Davis's death.  And they had to apologize.  Yes.  That's so stupid.  Yes.  The Greg Brady phone call yesterday.  Oh, was that great?  That was a lot of fun, man.  We got the exclusive there.  Boy, he did not give a fuck that Alice is dead. 
[00:16:30]  No.  He wasn't grief-stricken, huh?  He could give a shit.  On the TV, he was.  What made it really funny was, yeah, Jimmy wasn't here yesterday.  We watched Barry Williams on the Today Show.  And by the way, someone said that you could see him giggling during the Today Show interview  while we were calling him.  Really?  And I don't know.  I don't know if the two are related, but someone said that you might have got to him  because he started kind of laughing during the interview.  But he's very serious on the Today Show talking about Ann B. Davis.  And then he says the exact same stuff for Good Morning America. 
[00:17:00]  He told the same story, word for word.  What was the same story?  Oh, about how Alice was acting there for the Brady Bunch, and he was behind the camera with  the director at one point.  And he started laughing because Alice was funny.  And she said, comedy's not funny.  Yeah.  Ew.  Comedy's not funny.  And then he was kind of upset, so we went up to her later on and said, why'd you say  that?  What do you mean?  And she goes, I was just kidding. 
[00:17:30]  And then he told the same fucking story like three minutes later on another show.  Oh, I love that.  It was.  What a terrible story the first time.  I know.  And then we got a hold of him, and then he was like, oh, I guess I'm supposed to be sad.  Let me put my drink down.  Let me put my drink down.  He didn't give a shit.  So then we started making little jokes.  Little jokes.  And then there might have been a hang-up.  He hung up?  Oh.  There might have been a perfectly timed hang-up. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, he fucking hung up.  He was just getting into his big plug for his Branson, Missouri show.  And then I just hear that dial tone.  Like, oh, no.  It was so bad.  Oh.  I put together a nice video of the whole thing.  It was funny as fuck.  If you go to my YouTube channel, OP Radio, it's the latest video.  The Barry Williams hang-up.  Yeah.  But anyway, with that said, MSNBC had to apologize.  Well, I'll do it.  Oh, no. 
[00:18:30]  First, they did this.  Thank you.  This morning, we are remembering a woman who an awful lot of us welcomed into our living  rooms for many years.  Ann B. Davis was best known as Alice, the hilarious housekeeper who held the Brady Bunch together.  Davis died after a fall at her home.  She was 88.  Today's tweet of the day comes from John Stamos.  Alice, I'm sure Sam the Butcher is excited to see you.  R.I.P.  Ann B. Davis.  We didn't write that.  We did that as a joke yesterday. 
[00:19:00]  Sam the Butcher.  That's the best you can say about her?  Another fictional character is happy you're dead, too?  That's great.  That's your tweet of the day?  Tweet of the day.  Oh, God.  Alice, almost all people who have ever lived will be happy to see you.  Yes.  Because they're dead, too.  They're dead.  I'm sure Davy Jones is singing, girl, look what you've done to me.  Hitler and Ben Franklin are happy to see you.  When there's a big celebrity death, other celebrities say really stupid things on Twitter. 
[00:19:30]  Really dumb.  And the thing is, most of them aren't even connected to the person.  I understand if you're connected to the person and you tweet something heartfelt.  Uh-huh.  Because you actually spend time with that individual.  I get that.  But does John Stamos?  He never met this.  Maybe he met her.  What did he do?  Yeah.  Maybe he met her.  That's just a douche tweet.  Any other douche tweets about the passing of Alice?  That can be a good, fun little...  Douche tweet.  Fun little two-minute segment for our radio show today.  See who else tweeted something douchey? 
[00:20:00]  Tweeted something nice about Ann B. Davis.  No, douchey.  Of course douchey.  So then MSNBC had to come back on a little while later, three minutes later.  Oh, no.  And there's the Ann B. Davis we know and loved, and we just mentioned that she died at the  age of 88.  Our apologies because we showed a picture of the woman who played Alice in the Brady Bunch  movie.  Oh, she's talking about how, you know, invited her into our homes and didn't even realize. 
[00:20:30]  Didn't recognize if that wasn't the girl.  Who made that mistake at MSNBC?  They just went to Google Images, found the fucking Brady Bunch, oh, there it is.  There's the fucking tic-tac-toe board.  But it was the tic-tac-toe board from the movie version of the TV show.  Whoops.  So they had a quick apology.  Why would you have to apologize about that?  There she is, Ann B. Davis.  It's fucking Casey Kasem.  Yeah.  You got to kind of clarify that one.  When you show a living person and say they're dead, that's actually where the news should 
[00:21:00]  say, hey, sorry, we fucked up.  We said she was dead and she wasn't.  Oh, yeah.  When that Brady Bunch movie came out, it was kind of creepy.  That first one was really funny, man.  Kind of creepy how well they put that together.  Yeah, yeah.  They had all the little goofs.  And they goofed on the whole thing, which was fucking brilliant on their part.  Then the second one sucked a dick.  Yeah.  It was garbage.  Are you allowed to say suck a dick?  Well, if you're the dad.  Yeah.  Oh, here we go.  Moonshit, people. 
[00:21:30]  Oh.  Today's problem, Mars, every time I click on the phones, it locks them down instead of  answers them.  Peter in Massachusetts.  Peter.  Hey.  Good morning, guys.  Hey.  I got a question for you.  But if Neil Armstrong was the first man to walk on the moon, who the fuck was holding  the camera while he walked down the stairs and walked on the moon?  Oh, shit.  Wow.  You're a good one.  Good question.  Maybe the camera had to be set up first.  The cameraman got there first.  How could they overlook that? 
[00:22:00]  What do you think, sir?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I just think it's kind of fucked up.  I'm not one of those weirdos.  But I was watching it the other night.  I'm like, how the fuck?  But how about you use your own brain that Gawd gave you?  You know how important that moment of Neil Armstrong stepping out onto the moon was?  Don't you think they thought, like, we really should be able to capture this moment?  Right.  How can we get our NASA engineers to figure out how to capture that moment? 
[00:22:30]  You know, the same guys that got people from Earth to the moon to figure out how.  But they're going to fuck up that part of it.  I don't know.  I think it was our team.  Don't you think it was some kind of a boom?  Exactly.  Some kind of apparatus that they said, okay, now we got the camera out there and we're ready, Neil.  We're ready for your big moment.  That's exactly what it was, a camera on a little boom that swung out and videoed.  You've got to look at it. 
[00:23:00]  It's so far away from the space module.  You've never heard of a fucking wide-angle lens, my friend?  You could have a camera that's relatively close and it looks far away.  Turn binoculars backwards and look through them.  There.  It looks very far away, doesn't it?  Listen to yourself, sir.  Listen to, you see, like, they would figure out how to, like, fake the moon landing and then forget that they can't have a guy snapping pictures.  Like, oh, my God, how did we miss that? 
[00:23:30]  Someone might ask.  Right.  And all those people, all those people that were responsible for it.  Why would you hang up?  Because he now is hiding.  Hiding from a civilized intelligence society.  Just use goose.  He's a goose.  But just use your brain.  It's there for a reason.  Common sense.  Common God damn sense.  Do some reasoning.  Think it over in your own brain.  Yeah.  There's other ways to capture that shot without having a cameraman step out first and set up. 
[00:24:00]  Cameraman.  It's Harvey Levin.  It's just a cameraman.  Yes, but they didn't count him as a man.  He was a germ on the moon.  Let's say hi to Matt in Rhode Island.  Matt?  Yeah, maybe even on a simpler note, let's say they didn't have a boom.  He walked out there, set the camera up, put it on a one-minute timer, walked back up the stairs, turned around, and did the whole thing again.  I don't think that's right.  I don't think so.  No, because we would have saw those footprints. 
[00:24:30]  That's true.  And we would have saw the footprints of the cameraman.  We're not speculating here.  It was on a boom.  Right.  That's how it happened.  Right.  Yeah.  People are funny.  There was a Jonah Hill call, but he hung up.  Whatever.  Okay.  Jonah?  Jonah himself.  I think he might be coming back on the show finally.  I'm sorry.  I don't know.  Is Howard off?  Is he going to come over?  Yeah, yeah.  Is he allowed to come on? 
[00:25:00]  Are you sure?  Cool.  Exactly.  I don't know what happens with these guys.  Jesus Christ.  They just don't.  That's the problem.  They don't want to come on.  They're so afraid of displeasing another radio station.  They don't want to come on.  Please.  I don't want to make him unhappy.  Just tell him.  Make sure you clear it first.  That's all we request.  Yeah.  Please get clearance first.  We don't want you to get in trouble.  Oh, please.  Well, let's ask Roland.  Roland could tell us exactly what's going on with that.  I guarantee Howard's off the day he comes on.  Really?  And that's why we get him?  Yep. 
[00:25:30]  Roland's sporting his brand new New York Rangers T-shirt today.  Oh, no.  For the high fives in the subway.  Oh, yeah.  Yesterday, he had the old one.  He blew it.  But he just got home from Arizona, so he didn't have time to get the brand new one.  He's got the good one now, right?  He's got the good one.  I don't know what it says.  It says something like, what does it say?  New York Rangers for the Cup or something like that?  I think it's like a pre-winning the Stanley Cup T-shirt.  That's where we're at with T-shirts now.  I think it's next to the Cup.  Next to the Cup or whatever.  I'm going L.A. Kings all the fucking way. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, boy.  And the Rangers are a heavy underdog.  Are they?  Yep.  They're a heavy underdog in this series.  Yeah, you just can't tell with hockey.  Are you still a Rangers fan?  Oh, Ranger Blue.  Bleeding it.  Bleeding it.  Amazing.  Yeah, this is...  Yeah, all right.  Are there really a lot of people that think we didn't land on the moon?  Yes, a lot.  So why don't they just set up a stupid telescope somewhere and go, look. 
[00:26:30]  Look at all the stuff you can see.  You know, I'm not saying you didn't send stuff there.  Oh, is that what they would say?  Yeah.  Let's go to Greg in New York.  Greg?  Hey, how you doing?  Hello.  How are you doing?  I just want to say, I mean, all these conspiracy guys, like, our government couldn't pull off  a fucking health care website.  How are they going to pull off the greatest spoken of the world?  Well, you could say the government can't put up a website. 
[00:27:00]  How could they get to the moon?  Right.  Well, file it back then, I guess.  But, you know.  Oh, yeah.  I guess you could look at it that way.  You know, I mean.  Right.  Half full, half empty.  Shirt's wrinkled.  It's so wrinkled.  I grabbed it this morning.  It was kind of dark in the room.  And by the time I got out, I'm just like, I don't know.  I just love how wrinkled Anthony's hurt is.  It's so wrinkly.  It gives a fuck.  Well, I don't care.  I'm just commenting.  There.  I don't care.  There.  I just stretched it.  I'll leave it.  There you go.  My wrinkly shirt. 
[00:27:30]  Take a picture of my wrinkly shirt.  Of course I'm watching me.  I'm so wrinkly.  Mars, now the phone in the middle of the conversation decided to just go back on hold.  Oh.  So we have another problem with phones today.  It knew that.  It knew that.  Put it on hold.  Let's say, Greg.  Yeah.  All right.  You're back?  You went on hold for some reason.  You done?  Yeah.  Hey, I'm good.  I'll punch it out.  Go Rangers.  All right.  Go Rangers.  Go fuck yourself.  Go Rangers.  Go Rangers. 
[00:28:00]  Go fuck yourself.  Yeah, a lot of people say, they come up with all kinds of wacky things.  The shadows aren't the same.  And the camera wouldn't have worked.  The radiation.  This.  And everything has a logical, reasonable, like, not excuse, but cover story.  Yeah.  And people just don't want to accept it.  I don't want to think that thousands of people are involved in another, yet another government-sponsored hoax. 
[00:28:30]  So.  Bunch of dummies.  Why is Roland taking forever to come down the hall?  Why is it?  Well, next to the cup.  Yeah, there it is.  See, that's the shirt they're selling.  Oh, high five.  Next to the cup.  High five.  But if the Rangers win the Stanley Cup, then you can't wear that shirt anymore.  So that shirt's good for a week.  Roland, you bought a t-shirt that's good for a week, no matter what.  Yeah. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  It's great for Ranger Blue.  That shirt will not make sense either way in about a week.  That's why you have other Ranger t-shirts.  Whether they win or lose, that shirt will not make sense.  That's what you have other Ranger t-shirts to pick from.  What do you do with that one?  You only wear it for a week?  Now they're making t-shirts where you only wear for a week?  Yeah.  They have the Rangers Conference Finals.  You wear that for until they win the cup, then you switch t-shirts.  You get any high fives this morning on the subway?  No.  Why?  No go Rangers? 
[00:29:30]  What happened?  Their target demo is not that early in the morning.  On the way back, though, it's home.  I look at it.  You'll get some high fives?  Yeah.  Where are we at with Jonah Hill?  We were supporting him today about the suck my dick faggot.  Yeah.  That's on TMZ right now.  Yeah, he's on, I think he's in Howard today.  Today?  Yeah.  Oh, he's in the building.  Yeah, he's in the building.  Well, you guys didn't prove him, yeah.  So that's why I didn't.  Oh, he's in the building. 
[00:30:00]  He's in the building today?  Yeah.  Would we be able to get him today?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Well, he's here, though, so it's nice and easy now.  We won't get him today, then.  We'll only get him if Howard's off.  Or maybe he can stop by.  Can we get him to wave at us through the window?  Hi.  One of the guys that used to have you on.  Wave.  He's going to discuss.  He'll wave, but we have to move to the fishbowl quickly. 
[00:30:30]  Is he going to discuss?  Is he here now?  I think in an hour.  Yeah.  Well, I didn't know he was here today.  Yeah, and then he does.  Yeah.  Where's he going after Howard?  I have no idea.  Out.  And then he comes back tomorrow for the town hall at noon or one.  Ah, he won't be his rep.  He'll probably say he's doing morning TV.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So no Jonah Hill?  Yeah.  I mean, he wasn't approved, so I was like, all right.  He wasn't approved?  No. 
[00:31:00]  So I was like, okay.  22 Jump Street.  Shh.  You think he'll do out cue because of his comments?  He should.  He's smart.  He's smart.  Are they mad today?  Who?  The out cue people.  I don't know.  I just have ranger fever.  Yeah.  I see all blue.  Oh, boy.  Wow, I didn't know Jonah was in today.  This would be a great day for him to be on. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, but why would he?  He doesn't want to get in trouble.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's the deal?  People aren't allowed to do our show if they're doing Howard first?  Or on the same day?  Is that a real thing that happens?  Let's get into this for a minute.  I don't know.  Is it a real thing that certain guests are not allowed to be on our show the same day they're on?  Tim would know.  Tim understands what happens over there.  There's rumors that is going on.  Is that going on, Roland?  As you know. 
[00:32:00]  I don't know.  I mean, I asked him before.  Tim goes, no, that doesn't happen there.  So I'm like, all right.  So technically, we could have Jonah Hill on today, even though he's on Howard.  Yeah, if he was approved.  Yeah, I would go, hey, Jonah.  It is also true that they have to do Howard first, right?  Yeah, sometimes, yeah.  Always true.  And here's what I've heard they say to him.  Like, hey, you can do any show you want to do, but it makes you a little more special to us if you don't.  And I'm like, hey, that's his thing with exclusivity.  I get it. 
[00:32:30]  But any artist that was here first and honors that, personally, in my opinion, we should never fucking have back on it.  Guys that fucking blow us off for years and then want to come back on when they're promoting a gig.  Yeah, he kind of blew us off for a while, didn't he?  I don't even mean him at the moment.  I'm saying this.  Jonah did, though.  Yeah.  He knows he did.  Yeah.  Me and him went at it a little bit on Twitter about it.  But then, you know, I'm over it.  Whatever.  Said what I had to say.  What did he call you?  But we were...  Derogatory words, did he call you?  Right.  But, I mean, we were having Jonah on before anyone kind of... 
[00:33:00]  Before he became massively huge.  No one knew that he was going to be...  He could have been one of those one-and-done guys in Hollywood, but obviously that's not the case.  Maybe we could get McLovin.  Is he around?  Didn't he say no to us, too?  McLovin said no to us?  No, no.  No, you said no to him.  No, no.  Which was the other guy who said no?  Michael something?  I don't know if he said no to McLovin.  No, no, no.  Michael...  Oh, Sarah?  Sorry, yeah. 
[00:33:30]  No, no, he said yes, but he was coming with his director at, like, 11.  That was a problem.  No, no, no.  We were told we were the wrong kind of show for him to do.  Ah, that's right.  I remember that.  There was one of those with Michael Sarah.  We weren't the right show for him to do with the right tone.  We were the wrong kind of show.  It was...  Fuck me.  I spilled coffee.  Oh, guys, stop laughing.  I spilled coffee on my phone.  If it was a Samsung, it would be waterproof.  Oh, that's right.  Actually, I have the Samsung finally synced up. 
[00:34:00]  I was too scared to, you know, try to see if it's really waterproof.  You didn't throw it in the tub?  No, I was too scared.  That's your mind down.  No, Michael Sarah was doing a movie.  Oh, the indie movie.  Yeah.  Some kind of indie movie, and they said that our show wasn't right for him.  Yeah.  That's just stupid.  Yeah, the wrong tone for him.  That's just dumb.  Doing an indie movie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would imagine that there's a certain percentage of our audience that likes an indie film here  and there.  Probably.  So, why would it hurt him if he just came on for a few minutes and talked about his indie 
[00:34:30]  film?  Yeah, I know.  That's just dumb.  It promotes his brand, the Michael Sarah brand.  They're as smart as, like, Gervais is here tomorrow, so he's always kind of smart.  Well, he's a guy that's always been faithful.  Not many guys get to the top and continue to be faithful to us.  Ah, no.  Not many.  Not many.  There's a few.  You got the Ricky Gervais, and you got the Louis C.K.  Guys like that continue to do our show.  Yeah.  Amy.  Amy comes on.  She'll do Stern.  She'll come on here. 
[00:35:00]  Amy Schooms.  Amy.  Her finale to our show tonight, Jim Norton and Jim Florentine.  Nice.  I don't know what the scene is.  On Comedy Central.  Did you tweet it?  I don't know what scene it is.  Okay.  Yeah, I'm just texting.  No.  But there's three special people right there worth the prize of admission, which is free  to watch it.  We'll work on Jonah Hill for today.  All right.  I want to see what he says to that.  Car Rangers.  Out of curiosity, I want to see, you know, how this plays out. 
[00:35:30]  All right.  He's in the building.  He wants to promote, it's 22 Jump Street.  Yeah.  Why not 21 Jump Street?  Because that was last year.  We did 21.  Now they're 22.  And boy, you could have a franchise and numbers all the way up to like 99 Jump Street.  Yeah, 107 Jump Street doesn't sound right.  Let's play it out, though.  He's in the building.  Mm-hmm.  This audience is good for him and his movie.  So let's see what he says.  I'm going to guess a no.  I'm going to guess a no. 
[00:36:00]  But are you going to give it that old college try, right?  I'm going to give it the old college try.  Did you go to college?  What?  Did you go to college?  Who, Jonah?  You.  Oh, yeah.  Then I left to go work for Carson.  Johnny?  You.  Why do you think there'll be a no?  I don't know.  I just have this feeling.  It's kind of like when you take a shit and you go, it's going to be a good one.  It's going to be a good shit.  So was it a good shit or a bad shit in the end? 
[00:36:30]  We don't know yet.  No, in your scenario.  Oh.  What happens?  You think you're going to have a good shit and you can't knock it down?  No, it just happens too fast.  What's wrong with it happening too fast?  I like it brewing.  I don't like sitting there.  I enjoy it.  It's comfortable.  Hell, no.  Let's move on.  It depends.  Do you think this Jonah Hill thing is going to be liquid and then a little in the underpants?  It's going to be the dick in the ass.  Do you think he's going to address the problem that he has with? 
[00:37:00]  They'll probably ask and he'll probably skim over it real quick.  Yeah, it was a few years ago or something.  No, he'll address it.  No, Howard will ask.  It just happened.  He'll ask.  He'll ask.  What happened?  Call someone a dick-sucking faggot.  Ooh.  And then he's got to address it.  Right.  So that's a big get for Howard today.  Yeah.  But then we'll ask him about it.  If we ever see him again, he'll go, I don't want to talk about that.  Ah!  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  Well, you know, that's behind me now.  The publicist has asked that you don't discuss that. 
[00:37:30]  Right.  Oh, that's cool.  Right.  Yeah.  You think that's how it goes down?  He'll come in, but he only wants to talk about the movie.  Or be like some charity for some animal.  Yeah.  He was a good guest.  But some of these guys just want to talk about their role.  I know, yeah.  How do you tell most...  Hey, no one wants to hear about your fucking character for 18 minutes.  Right.  It's not interesting.  We'll talk about it.  Great.  But, you know, then we want to talk about some of the shit you've done. 
[00:38:00]  Right.  You see that interview with the guy that played Anakin, Skywalker?  No.  What an asshole.  He played the little Anakin in the first of the three.  As the cute little kid?  Yeah, the cute little kid.  How old is he now?  He's like 85 now.  Wow.  But it was really, like, awkward.  He's kind of a dick.  The guy interviewing him wasn't very good.  Jake Lloyd?  Jake Lloyd.  Very awkward interview with Jake Lloyd. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  Can we do it after the break?  Yeah, we could do that.  Has he been in movies since?  No.  So that's the problem.  That is the problem.  Well, he ruined Star Wars, too.  Why?  No, you're thinking of Christian.  No, you're thinking of.  Oh, no, that little kid.  Why did he ruin.  Why?  He's a little asshole.  Whee!  He was delightful.  Oh.  You liar.  What do you mean he was an asshole?  Yeah, he was an awful actor throughout the whole movie.  Well, it was just, it was a kid movie.  That's what sucked.  Yeah. 
[00:39:00]  You know, you can't blame the kid that he's in a kid movie.  That's what I have to say.  Stupid Jar Jar Binks.  Yeah.  Oh, the J.J. Abrams better not fuck this up.  He just cast that black chick from the 12th.  The young girl.  He is a slave.  And teams, you released pictures of the Millennium Falcon being built.  The what?  Millennium Falcon.  The Millennium Falcon.  The Millennium Falcon.  Millennium Falcon.  Millennium Falcon.  Oh, the big Star Wars guy. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, then he betrayed him.  Who spoke to Landau Calrissian when he came in?  Was that a Sam Roberts exclusive?  I did, yeah.  How was he?  Not good. 
[00:40:00]  Not good.  I'm so glad.  What was his problem?  He was a...  Slow?  Old?  An exhausted old man who was probably on pain medication because he had just come off of  Dancing with the Stars, my opinion.  What's he, 77 or something like that?  Yeah.  He's really old.  Yeah, and he's very...  He's an old 7-year-old man.  I had my Han Solo t-shirt on and he just looked at me like...  I see, you betrayed him and just looked at me like...  He's had it.  Yeah.  I talked to him briefly for a photo and he was very, very...  Not mean, but just quiet and uninviting. 
[00:40:30]  Like, just...  Like, not even in a hello way.  Like, he's just an old, tired guy.  Maybe he's got a little dementia going on.  Yeah.  It was a type of interview where you need a lot of questions.  Yeah.  Because those answers are not long.  Some of these fucking...  Some of these celebrities are just waiting for the old rollercoaster to go...  Back into the little house.  Yeah.  And the ride's fucking over, man.  That's it.  You think so?  Yeah.  Waiting for that last turn and then the... 
[00:41:00]  Brakes hit and the fucking little bar opens up and you're done.  That's it.  All right.  Well, go work on Jonah Hill.  All right.  He's in the building.  Good luck.  Godspeed.  Tell him Opie and Anthony want to, like, say hi.  Help him promote 22 Jump Street.  Maybe get a little exclusive on that TMZ situation.  The suck my dick faggot thing that's going on today.  Will he apologize?  Mm-hmm.  We say he should not have to apologize.  No, but I think he will. 
[00:41:30]  People say mean shit when they're very angry.  We all know that.  All right, Roland?  All right.  Can you check back with us in a few minutes?  Yeah.  First, I'll go get breakfast.  I love Roland.  I have a little blood sugar.  What can you do?  Love blood sugar?  LBS.  Oh.  It's called LBS now?  I don't know.  I thought that was lesbian, bisexual, something.  No.  It's called LBS.  I'm the LBS community. 
[00:42:00]  Go Kings.  Woo!  Oh, boy.  Good luck with that.  I know.  Go Kings.  That's good for you, Rangers.  If this stupid sports curse is real, then you're in a good spot.  Yeah, I'm excited.  I absolutely do not want the Rangers.  So, we got the interview when we get back?  Yes.  From the Star Wars kid?  Dumb little Star Wars kid.  The real Star Wars kid.  Yeah, not the fat one.  Not the fat viral Star Wars kid.  With the fucking closet pole. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  And then Aaron Lewis of Stained.  Ah, yes.  It's a good video that's going around today.  We'll play that and comment about that next as well.  Stay there.  And I'm doing a big variety show here.  This is the Johnny Bravo dream.  Oh, man.  It's called...  Oh, my God.  You didn't.  No, you fucking did not.  Oh, no.  Holy shit, you didn't. 
[00:43:00]  Our good friend, Barry Williams, everyone.  Barry Williams.  Holy fuck.  Talvis is dead.  That was the worst hang-up ever.  Really?  Yes.  Hold on, I'll make it.  Holy shit.  I don't know, freaks.  You'll be an entity. 
[00:43:30]  What's this?  Just a rejoin-er.  Just a rejoin-er.  Nice.  All right.  So we got this Star Wars kid interview.  Yeah, that little bastard from the...  And we're working on getting Jonah Hill on today.  But Roland is working on breakfast right now.  Yeah.  He said that, right?  Yeah, I think he said it. 
[00:44:00]  I was never sure what he's saying, really.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Sam left when we needed him to push play.  Oopsie.  How do we push play from here?  I don't know.  We should always kind of have somebody there.  I think so.  That would be nice.  You don't come in on the brakes and then leave on the air.  Someone's fired.  Sal to the rescue.  Sal to the rescue.  Sal.  Thank you, Sal.  Where's Sam?  You know what we're looking for?  He's probably fucking putting a picture of Sam.  No, we did that already. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, no.  You don't know what we're looking for?  Then why did you run in here?  I was on the phone.  I was answering.  We're looking for a little Star Wars kid.  But no phones are ringing.  Lloyd.  Fuck, what was his name?  I even tweeted it.  It's not in one of the tabs.  He doesn't have it up already, ready to go.  In one of the tabs.  Star Wars kid.  He was open before.  No, that's not him.  No, no.  No, that's Google Chrome.  What's on the other tabs?  No, what are you doing?  That's not right.  No, that's the show's Twitter. 
[00:45:00]  No, that's not it either.  And that's 90 seconds of knowledge.  Is this it?  Richie J. Clawett from Phantom Menace.  He hasn't done a lot of interviews.  I've been lost in the past.  Can't see anything.  You want it on the TV, Jimmy?  We have that new technology.  No, if you guys got a half hour just to set it up real quick,  you can run over, hit the button, hold those two things at once,  and I'll squint and look across the room.  We have that new technology after being off for a week.  We can put it on a TV for you.  Yeah. 
[00:45:30]  All right, so it's a cute little kid from Phantom Menace.  From Phantom Menace.  Right.  Right?  He was adorable.  Oh, just adorable.  I don't remember if his acting sucked.  Yeah, he was a kid actor.  That's all it is.  You know, a dumb kid does his dumb acting.  Where they stare off off to the side at their mommy and daddy.  Exactly.  During their lines.  Yeah.  Tries me nuts when I watch movies.  And then the idiots go, ah, good enough.  We'll use that take.  Yep.  So it's not good enough.  They're looking off to mommy. 
[00:46:00]  And what is mommy doing?  Like, there's a rattle or something?  I don't think so.  Oh, she's smiling.  I worked with a kid on Lucky Louie.  We had that little Kelly Gould.  Yeah, sure.  She was good, though.  She was very, very, like, for a little child, she was extremely professional and sweet.  But they have to keep them busy, and they have to take them to school, and there's all  this kid shit you have to do, and these rules you have to follow.  They will take you out of movies all the time.  Because all of a sudden, they do something.  They'll look up, look to the side, and you know they're not engaged in the scene whatsoever. 
[00:46:30]  We would shock her.  Oh, good.  Oh, yeah, we would just, like, push a little wire on the back of her hand.  I think it's great when you're watching, and they're, like, mouthing the words that  another actor is saying.  Oh, really?  That has happened, too?  Yeah, I've seen that one, too, with kids.  You know, they know the script.  They've got to kind of know the script, so they just start mouthing the words that the  other actors are saying.  Pretty bad.  There was a scene in Louie's show on FX there.  I'm a little behind, but his daughter had a scene, and it was one take, and she was amazing. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  Talking about how she hates school.  Did anyone else see that scene yet?  Where, you know, there was a problem at school, so Louie had to take his daughter out in the  middle of the day, and then they're at a park, and she just, like, just spills her guts about  why she hates school.  Yeah, those kids are good.  She was amazing, because I watched for the cuts, and there was not really a cut for most  of that scene.  And I'm, like, thinking she had to remember all that and pull it off. 
[00:47:30]  Talented little child.  And I can't wait for Louie to come back, because in that same scene, there's a guy that looks  dead in the background, just laying in the park.  And then they never go to that same angle, so you could see the guy again.  But I don't know if it was a homeless guy that just happened to be there, or if Louie's  fucking with people.  But the guy looked like he was dead.  I think everyone on camera is there on purpose.  All right, so why did he do that?  I don't know.  Who knows? 
[00:48:00]  I'm going to ask him next time he's here.  Who knows?  With Louie?  Well, maybe we could call him quickly and say, Louie, what was up with that?  But this season of Louie is really, really good.  Yeah.  Okay, here's the interview with that little bastard.  I didn't see this yet.  He's a little disagreeable these days.  Really?  Yeah.  And he's about, what, 18, 19, you said?  How old is he now?  He seems to be in that bracket somewhere.  Okay.  He's an adult.  Our next guest is from a galaxy far, far away. 
[00:48:30]  Jake Lloyd, a.k.a.  Anakin Skywalker.  Yeah, I wasn't going to say it.  I'm sorry.  Now, what have you been up to?  The movie came out, 99, was it?  Yeah.  So it's been 10 years.  Yeah, and I've been in school the entire time, so.  What are you studying?  Right now I'm studying film and psychology.  Okay.  So is the acting career over?  What's the plan with all that?  It seems to be relatively over.  I quit acting about 10 years ago, so I think that's pretty well in behind me. 
[00:49:00]  And editing seems to be where I'm heading next.  Okay, now a decade ago, it was a big deal.  Phantom Menace was coming out.  You were casting the scene.  It was a bit mysterious.  Did you not help you deal with it?  So this video is like five years old already.  Yeah, you said 10 years, 2009.  Yeah, so this was back in 2009.  Wow.  Yeah, I didn't notice.  I would say so far this guy's not being bad.  Like, this interviewer is just asking about his acting career being over, and this guy's  just at a game.  Right.  And he's just like, eh.  Yeah, but I don't think they're at a game.  I think they're at a Star Wars convention. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, is that what that is?  I saw people at the back of it.  It's definitely some kind of convention.  Yeah, it's a Star Wars thing.  He's at one of the conventions.  And the interviewer is very excited, because he's an uber, you know, geek.  Very excited.  I have Anakin Skywalker.  Right.  All right, continue.  Was it the time?  Yeah.  It was hard not to know how big of a deal it was.  And you would have seen a lot of the world, a lot of red carpet.  Yeah.  What was that like?  What was that like back in the day?  It was cool.  It was red carpet experience. 
[00:50:00]  I'm not a big fan of cameras anymore.  But it was fun.  Have you still got all the paraphernalia, your little figurines?  Have you kept all the merchandise?  No.  You shunned it a bit?  No.  And just didn't keep the merchandise.  And what about with the ladies?  Do you get recognized a lot?  Has it helped being the young Anakin?  I don't think pulling the Force card would be a really good idea with the ladies.  What do you use?  The editing card? 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, I always use the editing card.  He has to complete two more seconds.  Yeah.  So at school though, you must get recognized.  Has it helped you in the editing thing?  Or has it been a bit of a hindrance?  How do you mean?  Being the young Anakin.  That doesn't play into it at all.  So no one knows about it?  Or they don't care?  That's just the social environment that you're asking about.  It was obviously a big part of your life, which is why I'm asking. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  But it seems like you're not real happy about being asked about it.  No, I'm plenty happy being asked about it.  It just seems that I'm just trying to ascertain the real meaning of your questions and make  sure I give you the best interview possible.  And what's it like being at events like this?  Is it nice that you come halfway across the world and everyone loves you and recognizes you?  Yeah, it's nice. 
[00:51:30]  You come for the fans.  That's what you're here for, is to meet people who take you into their home and enjoy what  you did.  Or even if they didn't.  They still want to come up and ask questions and sort things out for themselves.  And that's what you're here for.  It's awesome.  Are you in touch with any of the old casts?  Not so much anymore.  I've literally just, I disappeared on purpose. 
[00:52:00]  And I do these maybe once or twice a year.  And I've only been doing that for the last couple of years.  All right, Jack Lloyd, we'll let you go there.  Before we let you go, child stars have had a bit of a, they get a bit of a reputation.  They turn to, you know, a life of drugs.  So may the force be with you.  Oh, well, thank you.  I don't think it's that bad.  No.  I think he's bitter.  He is bitter.  And I think the reason he's bitter is that he probably never got a role after Star Wars. 
[00:52:30]  Because he said in there that it was his choice.  I don't believe that whatsoever.  I don't think so.  Right.  I think for whatever reason, he didn't get to do any other significant roles after Star Wars.  Yeah, that was it.  And it got to a point where he had to give up on the whole thing.  And going to another side of the business.  Yeah.  And he's bitter about it.  Wow.  Very bitter about it.  You know what?  It comes up.  You go to those conventions.  Just fucking smile.  And yeah, sure.  Oh, fuck yeah.  And then, you know, cash your check.  He was very confrontational. 
[00:53:00]  The interviewer sucked.  Yeah, he might not have known if the interviewer was fucking with him.  Like, sometimes these guys ask these snarky questions.  I think that he couldn't quite tell where the interviewer was.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, so you're not basically saying, so you're not doing anything.  Do you still get recognized when you was a kid?  Right, right.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  And he wanted to be recognized because he was in other movies.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  I don't think he was in any other movies.  Dude, that's awful.  Because why would he still be in the business?  You peaked at fucking six years old.  And you know they had high hopes for him.  He's probably like, I'm going to be a big star. 
[00:53:30]  Dude.  You're in the biggest movie that was being released at that time.  It's a new Star Wars.  You're going to need a star.  A new Star Wars?  What?  Yeah.  His first film, basically, I would imagine.  And then.  Maybe a commercial before that.  Wham, wham.  And then it goes away.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Want to parlay this into editing, do you?  Yeah, yeah.  Because if he really hated Hollywood, he would not be behind the scenes.  He would just be doing something completely different.  What else was he in?  He was in.  Oh, this was when he was a little kid.  He was like a child actor. 
[00:54:00]  So when he was a little kid, he was in Jingle All the Way.  Was he a star in Jingle All the Way?  He was like the kid.  Arnold was the star.  He was?  Yeah, I guess.  Jingle All the Way.  Jingle.  Arnold.  And that's it?  And then.  Yeah.  And then he was on a TV series called The Pretender.  Right.  That didn't do well.  And then the rest of his credits are all Star Wars video games.  That's it, man.  And then he did one movie called.  What a bust.  There's no way it was his choice as a kid to get out of Hollywood. 
[00:54:30]  His parents worked him hard and they just couldn't get anything significant for the kid.  Nope.  Man.  Yeah, because he did one other movie and that was 2005.  And I never heard of it.  Madison.  A story about a man's personal struggle to victory in the 1971 Madison, Indiana hydroplane regatta.  Oh, my God.  Really?  Wow.  He's going from Star Wars to that?  Well, here's why he said he retired.  He cited bullying. 
[00:55:00]  Bullying?  He cited bullying on the part of classmates.  No way.  And the stress of doing up to 60 interviews a day.  Oh, no way.  Really?  He's probably answered so many fucking dumps of the same question.  What's it like?  How was it fun?  How many times have you done?  There's no way he retired over that.  Of course not.  No way.  Is it my mic or my headphones that are really good?  I'm trying to adjust over here.  I don't know.  I don't know what's going on.  Because I can't.  The phones are shitty today and I've been adjusting your mic all morning.  You guys.  Your mic's not. 
[00:55:30]  It's not a phase or something.  I don't know what it is.  It sounds like you're two feet away from the microphone, but you're right on it.  Yeah, talk on the mic.  Hey, hey, hey.  That's bad.  Sam, we better go home so they can fix the studio.  I don't know.  Well, that's been proven not to help in the past, so we'll probably try a different option.  What are you talking about?  I don't know.  If Vance Mike's not working, then we should go home.  Usually we don't care.  Why should we?  When you leave and come back, are things usually better when you get back?  No.  Yeah, significantly.  You think so?  When we take the day, yes.  Are you talking about the wireless mouse? 
[00:56:00]  Because I think Mars needs a few hours.  No, there's something wrong with your microphone.  Yeah, I feel like I'm not on the air.  I'm just some kind of bug with the phone.  Oh, no.  Whatever.  How do I never notice that shit?  Like, I have ears.  Yeah.  I have ears.  So tiny.  They are little things, but I just never notice.  Here comes Mars.  He's going to be like, we're going to have to reboot the system.  Yeah, I tried to tell you.  I don't want to throw anyone into the bus.  Remember that one?  Mars.  Mars, what's wrong with my mic? 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, something's wrong with my mic.  All kinds of fucked up.  It's not, you know, if you listen to it, I got nothing.  I got nothing.  Is this a Mars prank?  Everyone else sounds good.  Yeah, this is not one of your little jokes.  And my headphones.  Everyone sounds good.  Except me.  And to me, I'm very important.  Absolutely.  To us, you're important.  Oh, oh, oh.  No.  What happened?  That's the phones.  Mars.  Comment? 
[00:57:00]  Oh, boy.  Mars looking at the rug now.  No idea what he's doing.  Oh, no.  He's going over there now.  He's going over to the other side of the...  He's fucking with the TV.  Why are you fucking with the TV?  What's going on?  He did say he had more tricks up his sleeve.  What happened?  Mars has an idea.  What is that?  What is that doing?  Mars.  Hello?  What are you doing?  It's not that you're hearing.  You want to hear it.  Oh, you want to hear it?  Listen to them.  No, it sounds a little better right now.  No, it doesn't.  It does. 
[00:57:30]  I don't think it does.  It sounds a little weak.  I'm talking.  It's like muted.  Yeah.  You hear everybody and you don't hear me, right?  I hear you.  Oh, we hear you.  Not like...  Who's talking?  Put my phones on.  Oh.  You'll be like, what the fuck?  Put his phones on.  Maybe it's...  Is it that?  Mars is going to do it.  Maybe it's the headphone.  No, I heard something over here.  I just cranked your volume.  Check one, two.  Your headphones sound weird.  That's for sure, isn't it?  No, but if it sounds weird to Opie, too, Opie's not wearing the same headphones as Anthony.  It doesn't sound as bad right now.  No? 
[00:58:00]  But Dan doesn't sound as loud as Jimmy and Opie.  No.  Oh, whoa.  That was weird.  That's my Mars trick.  That was something weird going on right there.  A little Mars trick happening.  I'm going to get into a prank.  You rock...  What do we do, Mars?  Think it's just your headphones.  Should we take the day?  No.  Yeah.  Why not?  That's weird right there.  I don't know what that is.  That sounds odd.  All right.  I can't tell...  I can never tell the difference.  How's that?  I don't know.  Let's just fucking do a show.  I'll crank it up a little.  What'd you say?  Then everybody else gets louder. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  Just fucking wreaks havoc with my tinnitus.  I'm going to change...  I'll change these.  Yeah, swap those out.  Do you hear that, Mars?  There we go.  All right.  That's all I'm going to do.  Sounds better.  You rock. 
[00:59:00]  What do you think?  You don't convince me.  I've got to listen to him talk a little more, but I don't think he's quite weird.  Jim and open.  What happened?  You hear that, Mars?  Yes.  I see some kind of interference happening.  Donnie Wicklund.  Donnie's going into the other booth.  It's Andy Dunn Wicklund.  Is he going to...  Here, turn on your mic, you rock, so I can hear what he says.  It'd be funny if it's like...  Donnie's like, I'm sorry, I love you.  And you rock's like, I love you too. 
[00:59:30]  Mitch.  Donnie!  What is he doing in there, you rock?  Sitting down on the chair here next to me.  Doing what?  You're standing.  Don, what are you doing?  Ask him what he's doing.  Let's know what you're doing.  Wait.  We've got issues today.  What happened?  Be our translator.  Be rock.  He's coming in.  All right.  Looks all dejected.  I think it's okay.  Ant does sound a little bit louder now.  Oh, you're just saying that. 
[01:00:00]  No, I'm not.  Here comes Don Wicklund.  He's just saying that.  I think he is too.  A couple issues today, Donnie.  Mars is playing pranks.  Hi, Don.  Hi, Jimmy.  Ant's mic sounds out of phase or a little weak.  No, the mic was...  It's just something's going on.  I don't know.  No, it was more than that.  It sounds a little better now, to be honest with you.  Yeah.  And the phones aren't working properly.  Yep.  I told you that earlier.  I fixed that.  Oh.  Oh.  I haven't taken a call.  What's your scare? 
[01:00:30]  I didn't know you fixed it.  You didn't tell me.  No, I look like the asshole.  I didn't know you fixed it.  I thought it might be a major issue.  I don't know.  Sorry, Mars.  So, my crap.  Ah.  That's okay.  I'll just...  Now we're good?  Keep it like this.  Yeah.  Hmm.  I have no idea.  Sounds fine.  What?  It sounds fine.  Right to you, maybe.  Maybe you and your headphones.  Yeah, put on his headphones.  All right.  Yeah.  Iraq doesn't think so. 
[01:01:00]  It's just a little muffled.  Iraq, tell Don.  Iraq got this whole ball rolling.  It's definitely...  Ridicule.  Let me try...  Bullying.  Jack, hold on.  Iraq doesn't like...  Getting that first, and it sounded way, um, more, uh, way distant than...  Let's call it out of phase.  Way distant.  Let's call it out of phase.  A little out of phase.  A little out of phase.  Jessica, that worked.  A technical term Eric used way...  Like, he uses a technical term, too.  I don't know anything about this business.  Good enough.  You don't want good enough.  It's good enough.  The listeners don't want good enough.  Absolutely.  God damn it. 
[01:01:30]  Not for this show, they don't.  Yeah.  They don't want good enough.  No.  All right.  You do sound better now.  That's better.  Yeah.  It just feels better.  Should you adjust the mic a little bit, Mars?  Why is Don rolling his eyes?  Don, why are you rolling your eyes?  I'm fine.  Because he doesn't have time for this crap.  He's a busy man.  Busy doing what?  I have no fucking...  Okay, good.  Let's go to Aaron Lewis. 
[01:02:00]  Now that we're back.  And better than ever.  Aaron Lewis interrupts a concert.  He's the dude from Stained.  He's a little angry.  He seems to be a bit angry at times.  Was he angry at this?  Or was he jealous?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Aaron Lewis.  He's in the middle of singing his song there.  And then he just stops singing.  Because I guess some girl is being completely groped as she's trying to, what, crowd surf, 
[01:02:30]  I think?  That's what I would assume.  You chicks got to realize, though.  You fucking get up on that crowd.  You sound shitty again.  I know I sound shitty again.  I know it is.  I swear to God.  I'm not trying to be...  How come now that's better?  No.  You sound so, like, out of phase.  Yeah, yeah.  Something's fucked up.  It's when that's being played.  So what happens is Sam has arranged it so that his machine will dominate and Anthony will be dragged out.  All right?  All right.  Aaron Lewis is in concert.  I think Kansas City, right? 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  And this asshole filmed it the wrong way, obviously.  Yeah.  Which is frustrating always.  And a girl's being groped as she's crowd surfing, I think.  Yeah.  But that was always the case.  If you were stupid enough to get in a crowd surfing position, you got groped.  Whether you're a guy, a girl.  Well, girls get out a little more.  Yeah.  What do you think?  No, but there's videos of guys saying, you know, fuck.  Leave me the fuck alone.  What guys are going to say anything?  You know, it's other guys, though.  It's other guys grabbing your balls and shit. 
[01:03:30]  Just to be a dick, by the way.  Yeah.  Punching you in the balls.  I don't know why you would ever crowd surf.  People are assholes.  But he stopped the show to say this.  And it was...  And I'm gone.  All right, listen up, you fucking assholes.  That fucking girl right there is like 15 fucking years old.  And you fucking pieces of shit are molesting her while she's on the fucking crowd. 
[01:04:00]  Your fucking mothers should be ashamed of themselves, you pieces of shit.  You should all be fucking beaten down by everyone around you for being a fucking piece of shit.  If I fucking see that shit again, I swear to God, I will point you out in the crowd and have everyone around you beat your fucking ass. 
[01:04:30]  And then he goes into one of those, you know, melancholy songs after that.  I don't hear myself.  This is so terrible.  It's not good.  Oh, no.  I just don't hear myself. 
[01:05:00]  I don't think I'm...  Well, now we hear you, though.  Yeah.  There's a couple different things happening here.  There is.  It's not just their phone.  All of a sudden, your voice goes out of phase or low or distant, whatever the hell you want to call it.  And then it comes back and it's okay, but then there's something going on with your headphones.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You all good over there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All good.  How's the gain?  Should we...  Let me try a few.  A lot of detergent have to do with it. 
[01:05:30]  Fucking gain.  Gain.  Oh, that sounds good.  All right, let me try this.  All right.  That's better.  Perfect.  Listen to what it sounds like.  I'm all distorty.  I fixed it.  I fixed the problem, Mars.  We're good now.  We're good.  Yeah.  People are noticing that Sam's computer is much louder these days.  Yeah.  So, was anything switched between my mic and the computer?  No, sir.  What'd you switch in your prank?  Right.  It's another one of Mars' pranks.  It has a little prank show.  Is it a prank?  It puts anthrax in the studio. 
[01:06:00]  Huh?  It kind of was fine at the beginning of the show, right?  I didn't even notice it.  No, I noticed it right off the bat.  Did you?  But I didn't want to be a dick today.  So I was just like, yeah, fuck it.  Fuck.  What?  It's true.  I don't know.  How's that now?  I can't hear myself.  How's that?  Oh, now I'm totally...  Oh, perfect.  Yeah, this is perfect.  Listeners are applauding.  This is perfect.  How about somewhere like that?  Is that good? 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  No.  How about...  How about...  Nothing.  This?  I got nothing.  This or this?  I got nothing.  This or this?  This or that?  That?  This.  Or this?  I got nothing.  Uh-oh.  I pushed a button.  What's an aug...  Press the button, pull the chain, and then out comes the chocolate choo-choo train.  That's right.  That doody.  It's doody, Jimmy.  I love a good doody rhyme.  All right.  I got you good.  Try it now.  Oh, wow.  That's weird.  What?  Going back and forth between two ears. 
[01:07:00]  Is that good?  One ear.  That's fine.  Oh, my God.  Iraq, comment.  How's that sound, Iraq?  I think I fixed it.  Wow.  That's bullshit bad.  Much better.  All right.  Let me try something else.  All right.  All right.  Now try.  Ah, that's...  Hello?  Yeah, that's pretty good.  Hello?  What?  How about...  See, I can't have it like this because I can't hear myself.  Right.  I can crank up my headphone volume, but then everyone else is so fucking loud as my headphones.  I got it.  So I can't tell what I'm doing. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, wow.  That's really good.  It's like you're standing behind us.  Behind.  Yes.  I got it, M.  You can tape Anthony's mic behind the toilet.  In the toilet.  In the toilet.  Whoa.  Oh, wow.  That's like one ear.  Mars is walking around back there, just taking a peek around.  I got one ear on.  Oh.  Yeah.  I need one moron.  All right.  Try that.  Ah, there we go.  No.  Oh, boy.  That's the other ear.  Oh, wait.  I figured out how to balance it.  Like a hearing test.  Oh, there we go.  That's perfect.  How about that?  I have no idea. 
[01:08:00]  I want to go.  Just talk.  Hi, everybody.  All right.  That's right.  How you doing?  Left ear.  Left ear.  Wow.  All right.  Let's go back to the right ear.  How about that?  I hear it in this ear.  All right.  How about over here?  I'm raising my hand like the old hearing test.  Yes.  And also like the little unofficial Nazi salutes.  Yes.  Hello.  All right.  So that has to be there.  Yeah.  That's in the middle.  All right.  We're good with that.  Okay.  All right.  Let's try.  All right.  Wait.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's get it.  What is that?  Let's go with your phase.  What? 
[01:08:30]  Phase on or off?  Phase?  On?  This sounds scary.  What about the orgs?  Am I the phase?  Oh, I get it.  Just come on my phase.  That's funny, Jimmy.  Ah.  Is that perfect?  No.  Is that?  Wow.  That's better.  Well, it's, you know, it's something.  I'll give you that.  What's wrong, Sam?  It's very deep.  We're fixing the microphone.  It sounds better.  It sounds better.  There's more volume to it.  Thank you. 
[01:09:00]  More, yeah, more boost.  That's the record show.  I did that.  There's no doubt about it.  This is a Mars prank.  It's a Mars prank.  He does this.  Oh.  Oh, jeez.  What just happened?  What'd you do there?  He tried to override what I did.  Oh, shit.  A little joke from Mars Salino.  Manual override.  I fixed the whole problem, and then he went for an override.  Manual override?  That's like in the movies.  Fuck the override.  Now try it.  Yeah, fuck the override, boo-boo. 
[01:09:30]  I could deal with this.  You sure?  Yeah.  I could deal with it.  Yeah, whoa.  Opie is fucking smashing down on some buttons.  All right.  That's it.  You overrode me, you motherfucker.  The shields are dropping.  Well, raise them.  I can't.  I can't.  Fire.  So what do you think of the Aaron Lewis thing?  What happened?  When the girl was getting molested.  Why?  Yeah.  Well, good for him. 
[01:10:00]  Right.  Because that happens a lot.  But, you know, some dumb fucking 15-year-old girl wants to put herself up on a festival crowd  like that.  That's crazy.  She's going to get diddled.  Absolutely.  That's just nuts to even to do that.  And free speech would not have covered, by the way.  You can't incite a crowd to beat up somebody.  I was like, oh, what a dope this guy is.  If they would have beaten somebody like that, because he said, beat the shit out of that  guy.  You think he might have gotten sued?  Yeah.  That might have been a lawsuit. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, boy.  He was angry, though.  Yeah.  A bit angry.  Yeah.  So.  Because he wasn't down there, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  In the crowd.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can't fucking, if you're a young girl like that, you can't get on the fucking crowd.  Because there's young guys, and they're drunk, and they're just going to see fucking an ass  going by and fucking try to stick something in there.  And they grab and pinch.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah.  All right.  So that happened, which is terrific. 
[01:11:00]  No apology necessarily there.  Where are we at with the Jonah Hill thing, Sam?  Oh.  People want an update.  Should we get, I'll go get an update.  Okay, good.  Please do that.  The Robert's mic sounds fine.  I'll tell you, it's on purpose.  Yeah.  You think Sam was fiddling around under there?  Yeah.  Get his nice mic sound.  Comes in early.  He's nice and bassy.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  We'll take a quick break so we can fix this properly.  Shouldn't we wait, though?  Because he might be coming in.  Who, Jonah Hill?  We should get the update first, because he might be coming in. 
[01:11:30]  Well, I bet.  By the pace of Sam, by the pace that Sam is walking down the hall.  Is that one of our new interns?  We have new interns?  Yeah.  A couple of gals.  Yeah.  We went with the gals again.  That seems to be the warm now.  I love the local studs showing them around, Adrian.  Oh, Adrian.  Look, you know, I've been here a while.  I've been in the trenches a while.  Put the blueberries on the right side, the coffee.  Don't you worry about it.  She's coming in.  Oh, is he doing the whole, you know, I've been here a while.  I know the ropes.  You stick with me. 
[01:12:00]  Thank you.  It's going to be okay.  Thank you.  He's a dick.  Has he been nice to you so far?  He has.  Okay.  What did he instruct you to do?  Everything.  I don't know.  What's your name?  I'm Carrie Ann.  Carrie Ann?  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  Thanks.  Yeah.  Oh.  She looked.  She looked.  She did look.  She did look.  She's flustered.  She doesn't know what to do there. 
[01:12:30]  All right.  We're going to break so we can make sure everything's set properly.  Yes, indeed.  All right.  And we'll continue.  All right.  Hopefully we got the microphones working properly.  But no, we don't.  It's just awful.  You hear that?  Huh?  Yeah.  It's, um.  Are you purposely talking loud to make it worse?  No, I'm trying.  You hear that?  I don't even know how loud to talk.  I could turn it up.  Wait.  Now it's.  My headphones pegged right now.  And, um.  It's out of phase.  Ow.  It's out of phase. 
[01:13:00]  It's out of phase.  Everybody else.  I guess it's the mic.  Why don't we unravel that mic from that boom and just fucking put it in this boom?  And then we'll fuck with it like that.  Oh.  Well, at least we got something going on for today.  Unravel that mic.  Mars, when were you going to come up with that yourself?  That is true.  Mars.  Mars didn't.  Just the mic, though?  No, no, no.  Why would he want just the mic?  That doesn't make sense.  You could troubleshoot the mic on that.  That's true.  You could troubleshoot.  We can't troubleshoot right now. 
[01:13:30]  We have to.  We have to do a radio show.  I mean, we could troubleshoot as a dumb bit for five minutes.  But now we've got to actually try and do a show.  Turn that mic on.  Turn off it.  Turn off my original one.  Turn on that one.  What?  What?  What?  What?  What just happened?  Go.  Hello?  Hello?  Guest.  Guest.  Guest mic.  I know what mic it is.  Why are you yelling at Opie?  Why isn't it working?  Now that bypassed everything. 
[01:14:00]  That shouldn't.  What the f...  Maybe your vocals are just low.  Maybe my voice?  Do you have a cold?  You're fading away.  I'm going to have a cold.  How is that possible?  How is the guest mic not working now?  Sam, give me your mic.  Oh, wow.  Do you know how many listeners just cheered?  Oh, you haven't...  Uh-oh.  Wait a minute.  I didn't...  I didn't do that.  I didn't say you did.  And all the people who are using that mic...  What happened?  Wait, what?  I'll do it.  I know what he's talking about.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 
[01:14:30]  There we go.  Why was that out of face?  How's that?  Out of face.  Everyone talk?  Everything's out of face.  No.  You're out of face.  I have a...  The one's out of face.  I have a grave fear that my headphone volume is up very loud right now.  It is.  But everybody's okay.  I have a very big fear that when we play something from the computer, I'm going to get blown the fuck out.  All the things you should be afraid of.  Let's play the Eels Novocaine.  Go ahead.  We're going to play the Eels Novocaine to test this. 
[01:15:00]  Is this how loud it is?  Is it?  It's the intro.  I'll fuck the intro.  Get to the meat.  These guys were supposed to be more famous than they were.  That's fine.  That works.  Novocaine for the soul.  That works.  For now.  We'll do it this way.  Just have a chord laying across everything.  That's fine.  You know this song?  Uh, no.  I don't.  This was a huge song for Eels. 
[01:15:30]  I don't think they like being called the Eels.  What year is it for Eels?  96.  Oh, wow.  18 years old.  Jesus.  And they didn't do anything else.  This is a one-hit wonder band right there.  Why can't we play the rest of it?  The rest of it was a video.  That was a stylistic choice.  Seriously?  Yeah, that's Eels for you.  My mic is, uh...  That's slippery.  It's rigged.  We rigged it.  Yeah.  Jury rigged it.  Jury rigged. 
[01:16:00]  That's one way to say it.  Yeah.  We're good now?  I think we're, uh...  Are we square?  We're square.  Are we square?  We're square.  You fucking mute.  Are we square?  Yeah.  Fargo.  Oh, man.  Are we square?  You should have seen the other guy.  I got shot in the fucking face.  Ah, shit.  Well, you got Dan Marino causing quite a, uh, issue this morning. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, about, uh, the conclusion of the brain.  I don't think he's, uh...  I don't think he's broadcasting anymore, so he's safe to do this.  I believe he stepped down.  Oh, no conflict of interest?  I believe he stepped down with the whole NFL.  Which one was he on?  NFL today or whatever?  Did they fire him, you think, and then he's, like, just pissed off?  I heard that he was moving on for whatever reason, so...  And now he's suing the NFL.  That is a massive problem for the NFL.  It really is.  It's not just some guy that, you know, no name, hurt his head. 
[01:17:00]  This is a beloved, would you say, national treasure?  There were some names in the hurt my head, um, group.  Not in the likes of your Dan Marino, right?  You had McMahon.  Oh, who gives a shit about him?  One year, he was in the news.  One year, he was in the news.  With his dumb headband.  And his Super Bowl shuffle.  Did you like that song?  Oh, was that bad?  A lot of guys, though.  I think Tony Dorsett is in that group.  All right. 
[01:17:30]  He's a little pissed off.  Very fucking big.  He was scary.  Remember when we played that audio?  Yeah.  A few months back with Tony Dorsett?  Dan Marino's beloved.  Yeah, he's one of the greatest of all time.  He's a national treasure.  National treasure.  You can't have your national treasures coming out and saying stuff like this.  Suing the very organization that made him a national treasure.  That's right.  Football Hall of Famer Dan Marino sues NFL over concussions.  Dan Marino, the Hall of Fame member and former Dolphins quarterback last week, sued the NFL over concussions, according to federal court records.  Because basically what this is about, the NFL paid some of the old guys, you know, they had a settlement for, I think, just under a billion dollars. 
[01:18:00]  Something like $765 million, I think.  Yeah.  I just read that.  So it is $765 million.  Right.  Not like.  You want it to sound like you just kind of pulled that out of the air?  I'm thinking.  I do remember hearing it was pushing a billion dollars that they were paying out.  Yeah.  And at first people were like, wow, that's pretty fucking impressive.  But then when you break it down to what the individuals are getting from the settlement, it was nothing.  As the behind-the-scenes effort to gain approval for the proposed $765 million settlement of the concussion litigation continues, Marino and 14 other former players sued in Philadelphia court. 
[01:18:30]  At least 41 members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame or their estates are among about 5,000 former players suing.  5,000 players are suing and you've got 41 members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame as part of this lawsuit.  Sue everyone.  The 18-page complaint alleges the NFL concealed information about football-related brain injuries and misled players claiming that are similar to those made in more than 300 related lawsuits. 
[01:19:00]  The NFL has repeatedly denied such claims.  Now, what could they possibly have told?  But if you're playing football in the NFL, you've got to know that that shit is not good for you in the end.  What could the NFL have possibly told the players that would have made them safer?  Hey, bashing each other in the heads with your own head.  Right.  It might cause some brain damage.  I think the players have to take a little responsibility. 
[01:19:30]  You have to know what you're putting your body through.  Yeah.  You just have to know.  Plus, there are always older players to look at and go, oh, fuck, why does he act that way?  Oh, I know why.  Yeah.  He got hit in the head as much as I'm getting hit in the head.  Now, can't, like, boxers, can't they just sue now if this goes through?  Right.  Because that sport is, you know, dangerous also.  Well, I was telling you before the show, in this PC world we live in, it's going to be tough for football. 
[01:20:00]  To do anything, yeah.  It's going to be really tough.  Yeah.  Football's in trouble.  Especially with all these lawsuits.  Yeah.  How are they going to handle this?  These big fellas beating each other up.  They're going to change the rules in such a way that we're not going to be interested in the sport anymore?  I mean, you know, they don't have the technology yet.  It's gotten better, but, you know, you're still fucking hurting yourself when you're doing those hits. 
[01:20:30]  I say robot football players.  Robot football players.  We need robots.  Nice.  Yeah.  Marino's lawsuit seeks medical monitoring and unspecified financial recovery.  Yeah, what is it that they're claiming the NFL did that was negligent?  Right.  Did the NFL lie to them?  Like, tobacco companies lied about what was in their product?  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know.  Were they telling players, look, you know, yeah, it sucks you got a concussion, but you'll be all right long term?  Were they lying in that way?  That's what I'd love to.  Can we find Marino's lawsuit, what he's, like, alleging? 
[01:21:00]  Allegedly.  Marino's bankrupt.  Frankie in the Bronx.  How dare you?  Frankie.  Morally.  That's funny.  Huh?  Here's the deal.  This is the first time Marino's jumping on this lawsuit.  Uh-oh.  Seriously.  The phone cut out there.  Mars.  Did he go to hold again?  Yes.  We have all sorts of problems with this studio today. 
[01:21:30]  What happened from yesterday to today?  Don't worry, they'll fix it.  Yeah, that's true.  Oh, now we're in January?  What, uh...  Guy went to hold?  Frankie in the Bronx.  Yeah, you there?  Frankie!  All right, continue.  Now he's gone.  Oh, there goes the mouse.  Thank God that was a wireless mouse.  I know, because if it was a wireless mouse, it would bounce back and hit you.  That's a wired mic.  Yeah.  Take this shit, please.  The, uh...  The phones are a bit amiss. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  They're not working well.  Seems very helpful.  I put them in my mouse right back.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was supposed to shatter, but I was so pissed off, I threw it low and hit the cushy fucking couch.  That's all right, it bounced cutely.  Cutely?  It's like throwing a nerf.  That should have been...  Oh, man.  Very disappointed.  I might have broken the window.  Who cares?  Wow, fuck.  If you...  Then maybe they'll pay attention to us and our issues. 
[01:22:30]  If you broke the window with a fucking mouse...  Well, whatever.  I'd pay for it.  Give the fuck.  Wow.  I'd pay for the window.  But I didn't sign anything.  So if it happens...  So if it happens now...  That was just the last time.  Yeah.  Not this time.  Does the mouse work?  It's an amazing mouse if it does.  I'm going to get on Tinder.  Oh, it does work.  Are you?  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  Meet some fucking bitches.  I think so.  All right.  I wanted Frankie, because he said Marina was going through bankruptcy. 
[01:23:00]  That's crazy to me.  Jim in Pennsylvania.  Oh.  Yeah.  Jimmy.  What's up, man?  Well, when the NFL started with the can't hit the quarterbacks, Jack Lambert said...  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  There you go.  Fix it.  Oh, no.  The mouse...  Now we don't have to worry about phones.  I was waiting for, like... 
[01:23:30]  Fuck.  I was cringing as he's talking.  I'm going, please don't cut off.  I was going, please do.  I wanted to see that mouse come up flying, and it did.  Is that...  Is it okay?  I don't know.  I mean, I'm not paying for it.  Oh, shit.  So you're going to fuck themselves.  It's all right.  Right over there, Mark.  Pick that up.  That's just a little piece.  That's the mouse's hiney hole.  And the batteries...  I knew we were playing Russian roulette with the phones.  Oh, yeah.  I knew they weren't fixed.  They're not fixed.  Nothing's fixed.  Oh, man.  Look at that mouse.  That's right.  This mouse is tough, though.  I'm cleaning it up. 
[01:24:00]  I think this mouse has earned its right.  I don't see it.  Oh, I don't see it.  Oh, Mars.  Mouse lover.  Why doesn't it work?  Clean it up, you guinea brat.  Why doesn't it work?  I always hated the fucking wireless mouses, because they would never move properly without  a track pad.  I'm like a good wire.  I could talk for hours about it.  Might have to.  Hey, I hate them.  The mic...  It doesn't work.  Uh-oh.  The mouse doesn't work.  You need a plug-in mouse now. 
[01:24:30]  Huh?  Maybe...  Battery, Ralph.  Don't be too sure.  I ain't got no hairpin.  That thing went fucking flying.  Why didn't it shatter?  They're making it out of space-age polymers these days.  I don't know what that means, but...  Well, it doesn't work, though.  They're doing...  Oh, look at that.  Nice.  You think the phones need a reboot?  What?  No?  What do you think it is?  I'm mystified. 
[01:25:00]  I think a reboot cures everything.  Well, not for the mouse.  How come the mouse doesn't work?  The mouse is faulty.  I'm talking about for the phones.  Do you think the phones need a reboot?  No.  What do you think, Mars?  Quick reboot.  It can't hurt.  It wasn't the mouse that was doing it, was it?  No, of course not.  No, that's silly.  Answer the phone and didn't touch the mouse, and these fuckers are going back on hold in mid-conversation.  It's a computer glitch.  Give him a reboot.  Remember the...  Exactly. 
[01:25:30]  Because it's the same shit, and they don't want to hear it anymore.  I get it.  Well, things will be fixed.  But we were supposed to get a brand new studio during our break, but the assholes that are holding the money hostage around here,  unless one guy needs money, decided that we didn't need a new studio or need a major improvement.  So then we come back to shit.  Shitty problems.  Oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  I like Mars just trying to readjust the batteries.  I'd go with a wired mouse. 
[01:26:00]  What?  Where's your mouse?  How's my mouse?  Where is your mouse?  Oh, Mars is trying to reinsert the batteries.  Yeah, Mars is doing something that my aunt would do if the fucking mouse broke.  She'd put the batteries in the other way.  Maybe this will shock the back into working.  You figure it out, Nana?  Yeah.  You close your robe, your clit's showing.  You never want to hear that when talking to Nana.  Exactly. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, my God.  What happened?  What are we doing now?  Are we wiring in a mouse?  If you bring in a phone that isn't from this decade, I swear to God it's going through that window.  Oh, no.  What's Sam's doing?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Yeah, take a call.  Plunk down a phone line.  Plunk down a phone line.  Let's see.  That works.  What the hay?  We can't.  We can't because we need wireless mouses around here to answer phone calls.  Yeah, Mars, put that back on. 
[01:27:00]  You did the old battery switcheroo.  That's going to fix everything.  Was that just in case you wanted to answer a phone from the toilet?  Like, why would you need a wireless?  That's a great observation.  Why need a wireless mouse if you just have their answer in the phone?  You missed the meeting, aren't they?  Like, look, you could have your water in front of it now.  Oh, I see.  So what we decided to do during the break was make the place worse.  A little more complicated.  Because that had no, there was no issues with the mouse we had.  Yeah.  I think. 
[01:27:30]  Why don't we have a, why don't we have a new studio, Don?  Is it the Money Men?  Hold on, I would ask Don to comment, but he can't because there's no mic here.  Don, can you?  Don, they're asking you.  Mr. Wickland?  They're asking you to comment, but you can't hear.  Let's see, we can't.  The mic is faulty.  There's that one over there.  I would say because I had to rig it.  Yeah, this mic's not good here.  Comment.  Comment, Mars.  I'm enjoying this. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, my God.  What's the problem now?  There's a theory.  What's the theory?  Uh-oh.  There's a theory, what?  Sabotage.  Or is it?  Mars Jones?  Buttons on the side.  Ooh.  No.  How?  Oh, no.  I told you exactly what I did.  I went like this, and I put the guy on our show, and then I let go of the mouse.  But do you leave?  And then they talk for 30 seconds, and they go back on hold.  It's completely not working.  He's never done it before, so why would it start now? 
[01:28:30]  Right.  We didn't have that mouse before.  That's true.  It is a new mouse, and there aren't many glitches.  Why isn't the mouse working?  Because you broke it.  Yeah.  Is this a Mars prank?  It sounds like a Mars prank.  I'm talking to Sam's mic, because when you're talking in a thin air, no one can hear you.  I'm not talking at all.  I'm watching her die.  Why doesn't the mouse work?  Iraq, you happy this isn't you?  So very happy.  That's right.  When you threw that mouse, Iraq jumped up on the chair. 
[01:29:00]  You got it in today, dude.  I'm sorry, Iraq.  What happened?  I got to go underneath there.  You see him in the faces?  Uh-oh.  What happened?  It's not that easy, Don.  Oh, shit.  You wouldn't get the fucking fire news.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're going to take that shit.  This is some hip-hop shit.  Nice.  Oh, the door is slammed. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, yeah.  Look, he can only be pushed so far.  That's true.  This is one flu over the cuckoo's nest every day.  It really is.  It really is.  Mars wants his cigarettes, and Don's tell him, just give him his goddamn cigarettes.  I don't want your mouse or your mouse.  I want my mouse.  Holy fuck.  Mac, are you going to fix my mic, Mac?  But he's got to crawl all the way under there.  Did you give him the business?  Yeah. 
[01:30:00]  Fucking business.  You told him, Don.  Well, you moved on and said, get the fucking mouse.  Nice.  You've got to be shitting me.  Yeah.  Now what's going on?  I was watching this yesterday.  It got me fucking pumped.  Yeah?  A little Rocky III.  Rocky III is a good one.  That was a realistic boxing interview.  What's your prediction?  Pain.  Pain.  Yeah, that's how all boxing interviews go.  Of course.  Don, did you wonder where Clubber Lang got his tuxedo and how he got it fit for that benefit? 
[01:30:30]  His feathered earring, yeah.  Like, I couldn't picture him at a store buying something.  Renting it.  He rented a tuxedo.  Yeah, he rented a tuxedo.  I need a tuxedo.  Like, it just never seems nice.  No manager helping him out.  Yeah.  Don, why doesn't the mouse work?  Really?  Yeah.  It's a little broke.  It's broken.  How did it break?  I'm going to go with a cummerbund.  Yeah.  You know.  I just can't fucking picture it. 
[01:31:00]  What favor?  That stupid callback.  Oh, God.  Do-do-do-do-do.  Apollo.  What favor?  All of a sudden, that fucking black snake just pulled out.  Worked that hair lip on its leg.  That was the favor.  You suck, Apollo's dick.  Wait, what is that?  Let me see.  Look at what year is this.  Wow, wait.  Jesus Christ. 
[01:31:30]  It's got a roller.  Dude, it's not even an optical mouse.  It's got a roller on the bottom.  That's from the Apollo space program.  Come on, Mark.  Don't you have an optical mouse?  Oh, Mark.  He's calling you out.  Here, Don.  Mark.  That's hilarious.  Here, that mic doesn't work.  Here, you take this mic for the fight.  I used to play video games with that.  It's a radio show.  Don's pissed off.  He's saying, don't you have anything newer than that?  I probably do.  Let me just get it connected, test it.  It's not a ball.  It does.  It does.  Oh, I've said that after a thing. 
[01:32:00]  It's a scroll wheel, not a ball.  Scroll wheel.  Let me get it connected.  Don't throw things in that ball.  Look under the mouse, Mars.  Here, look under the mouse.  It's a ball.  It's a ball.  It's a ball.  We're having a ball.  What?  Exactly.  It's a ball under the mouse.  There's no place for a dance to break out.  Boo.  There you go.  Boo.  Yeah, he needs a mouse pad now.  Oh.  Oh, we got a mouse pad.  You went back in time.  Yeah.  I want a mouse pad with Jimmy's face on it or something. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, something cute.  Yeah, like the good old days.  Isn't it amazing how ancient that looks?  Yes.  Like a few years ago, that was the fucking shit.  Cutting edge.  It's like the 9-11 laptops that they show where there's the teeny screen.  That looks like cave wall writing.  Yes.  Look at this.  That's just the...  Oh, I hope it falls.  I know it's going to fall.  Is it time for a test?  Yeah, hold on, Marge.  You've got to do a test.  You've got to do a phone test.  Marge just needed a long cord on the mouse.  Yeah, and a stool. 
[01:33:00]  So he went with a mouse literally from 1996.  That's where he sleeps under the console.  I swear, I used to play like my video game.  I played Half-Life with a mouse like that.  By the way, Frankie's back.  You have to clean it out.  Frankie's back, by the way.  Oh, right.  You get like fucking crumbs in it.  Yeah, gunk cum.  Yeah, it's like crumbs.  Loads.  It's glazed.  My mouse is glazed.  It's like an artifact.  Really, that little ball looked like a glazed Duncan Munchkin. 
[01:33:30]  What is he doing?  Marge just left in a panic.  Uh-oh.  What is he doing?  He said, fuck you and left.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Is it a fucking USB mouse or it's got one of those fucking old school...  It's a PS.  It's a Microsoft.  It's a DOS prompt.  Because he probably went to plug it in and realized it's not even a USB mouse.  Yeah, he doesn't understand.  You know what really puts him up? 
[01:34:00]  Pull it out.  Oh, no.  But he went under there.  Look at it.  What?  What?  It is.  It's got the old fucking...  PS2.  It's got the old interface to plug into the computer.  Nice working with you.  Fuck you.  It wasn't USB.  It was made just for the mouse on the back of your computer.  Remember that?  Yeah.  You plug it in.  So we needed an adapter.  Holy fuck.  That's hilarious.  What is that?  An RS-232? 
[01:34:30]  How does everything go wrong in one day?  Shooter.  In one lousy day?  I don't know.  It's astounding.  The whole place.  It's like my favorite bumper sticker says, Murphy's Law.  Dot, dot, dot.  You don't like Murphy's Law?  No.  I don't like it ever referred to in this century.  Terrible.  Don, find out what he's doing.  Who is this Murphy?  I like his floor.  There's no mice laying around here.  Mouses.  Yeah.  No, it's mousse. 
[01:35:00]  Mousse.  Mousesses.  That should be the easiest thing to do.  It's a satellite radar.  They're literally spacecraft circling the Earth to make this work.  Yep.  And apparently...  Too advanced for our own good.  Yes, huh?  Yeah, I like the old meat and potatoes mouse.  Right.  Plug it in, you go zip, zip.  When he fucking came in with that.  That was great.  When he came in with that mouse.  400 foot cord. 
[01:35:30]  Get the fucking mouse, Mars.  It's got a 400 foot cord.  It's got 12 adapters on it.  I don't think I ever saw Wicky curse before.  Here he comes.  He's got a handful of wires now.  Here he comes.  Oh, good.  All right, let's see.  Oh, Brett.  Hopefully some water in his hand, too.  What do we got now?  There he goes.  He's going back under.  Get under there, Mars.  He's submerging.  Plug in the old mouse-a-roo.  That's it.  Oh, man.  Did you get a mouse from this century?  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Fucking A.  Mars, you're going to take that? 
[01:36:00]  It's not his fault.  It's not his fault.  You're going to take that?  I'm going to take that.  All right.  It's this world coming to.  Uh-oh.  Your screen just went off, O.  Yeah, I know.  Stop unplugging shit, Mars.  Panicking back down there.  I have no signal here in my little monitor.  Oh, no.  Are you rebooting the phones, Mars?  So, I guess it was a good idea not to fix the studio during the break, Don, huh?  Oh, shit.  They know what they're doing upstairs.  Oh, shit.  That was a good idea, right? 
[01:36:30]  Hey, Mars, leave my zipper alone.  Okay.  So, he's under the console, implying he's going to suck my dick.  Oh, okay.  I thought you meant that he was zipping it up and you didn't like that.  Uh-oh.  Befuddled?  That's befuddled.  We're rebooting Windows XP.  By the way, there's no more updates for XP.  My AOL fucking 7.0 needs a disc.  There's no more XP updates?  No.  They're done with it, huh?  They're done with it.  What's the new thing for them?  Move on. 
[01:37:00]  I'm getting a does not exist.  Oh, no.  Spare 192.  What?  Do you see the mouse?  Yeah, it's right there.  You're holding it.  I moved the mouse.  It must have been searching for any integrity.  It's just hilarious.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Hey, it's moving.  Okay, I see what's going on.  There you go.  The mouse is moving.  So, no one asked the phone to get a run over here.  Right.  And click it.  No, no, no.  I know, Mars.  I'm kidding.  Oh, Mars is back under.  Oh, literal Mars.  Coming around.  I like this. 
[01:37:30]  Little plug and play.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Donnie's getting involved.  Rolling up those shirt sleeves.  You see my hand?  Wow.  You see my hand?  Yeah, exactly.  The three students.  See my hand?  Yeah.  Ow.  Why, you?  All right, now we just need to do something with it.  I also noticed that you're using a left-handed.  I'm using it now.  Left-handed?  I could turn it left-handed.  No, I don't need it. 
[01:38:00]  Hey, Mars, the mouse don't seem to work.  Why, you?  It's plug and play, stupid.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, take a phone call.  All right, let's go back to Frankie in the Bronx.  Hey, Frankie in the Bronx.  You sound like one of the stooges.  Thank you.  Yeah.  All right, Frankie.  It all started with you.  We're back to you.  So what's going on?  Shit, how does this happen?  This technology shit.  Yeah.  That's a good way to put it.  Oh, you're having a heart attack, because I could just see the red bits in your cheeks. 
[01:38:30]  The aggravation of butt cheeks.  That's called chafing.  From pecker entrance.  Jesus.  Inhale the positive, exhale the negative, all right?  Right on, brother.  Right on.  Well, it seems, unfortunately, I'm saying that this call hasn't been cut off.  Exactly.  I'm rooting for a phone meltdown.  Maybe the phone had just become aware and realized every call stinks and hung up on it. 
[01:39:00]  Sorry, you drunk.  Anyway.  And, you know, Dan Marino got fucked by a hedge fund guy, and he lost about $18 million.  Oh, no.  And we're building a house over in, I guess, Billy Joel and City Island, whatever that town is.  It really is hilarious.  Why not diversify?  You just fund hedges.  We had to shut everything down.  We did the work there, and we had to shut the job down, because they split, and there's 
[01:39:30]  money somewhere in Barbados or some reason.  Oh, no.  He got ripped off, huh?  Oof.  Yep.  He's done it.  And he lost his job from CBS so long ago with Sunday football on CBS.  Damn.  Why did he leave CBS?  They fired him.  They brought a new blood.  They got rid of the marble talking for black guy.  Guy with marbles in his mouth.  He's got his name.  Shannon Sharp?  Shannon Sharp's gone, and so is Dan Marino.  Why would they get rid of Dan Marino?  I thought he did well.  You know what? 
[01:40:00]  I'm not sure, but I think it all has to do with...  ...the bad publicity is about to get the bomb on him any day now, I'm telling you.  About what?  The hedge fund guy?  This is just my opinion, by the way.  It's not the opinion of the radio station.  All right.  The radio station.  Wow.  All right.  Doesn't this guy know the trouble he could cause by just hanging up his own phone in  mid-sentence?  I know.  Does he know what he could have done by just doing that?  Yeah.  It would have been great.  We're back, guys.  I'm like, what the fuck? 
[01:40:30]  We're back, guys.  I think we're back.  Wow.  We're back.  You got a mouse.  20-minute detour.  A newer mouse.  One of those futuristic laser mouse.  From now on, anything that breaks down, I just destroy.  Period.  And when the machine breaks down...  You can't talk into that mic, dummy.  There's no mic there.  See, because we had a...  We had to put that one over there for Antony.  That's right.  Antony had to talk into it.  Yeah.  You can hear Antony?  So when's the remodel happening?  I can't wait to hear my mic tomorrow. 
[01:41:00]  January.  Nothing better than walking in after something's been fixed.  It'll just sound like fucking...  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  Sound like...  So there you go.  Marino has joined the lawsuit against the NFL.  Oh, is that where we were?  I guess.  18 million from a fucking hedge fund guy?  Wow.  Can you imagine getting ripped off like that if that's what happened?  That would be like a...  That's a murderable...  It's a murderable offense.  Yeah.  And you shouldn't go to jail for it or anything. 
[01:41:30]  But he's got to be worth way more than 18 million.  Someone like Dan Marino.  How much...  When did he retire, though?  Were they getting that kind of...  Even though I know it wasn't that long ago, but were they getting those $10 million contracts  then?  Marino's been gone...  At least 10 years.  10, right?  Probably 10.  Did you think it was the mic, Mars?  No, no.  Could you Google, Sam, how much does Dan Marino make this for?  What is he saying?  I think he wants to troubleshoot.  Mars, you got it.  You got it, Mike.  You got it, Mike.  Oh, tomorrow I'll have a new mic.  We can't hear you or something. 
[01:42:00]  I'm not kidding.  But I don't know if it's the mic.  Mars, you're taking a lot of shit today, so I think you should step up to one of those  mics right now.  Talk to Sam, because I don't know what he's got to say.  Yeah, go...  That was not working.  Give me six.  Six?  All right.  And he said that before.  And I saw the shots Don Wicklund was taking at you.  Yeah?  They were pretty substantial.  They were.  So what's your rebuttal?  Oh, you guys are just instigators.  He's a sweetheart.  Yeah.  You and Don get along?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  All right.  What do you think the issue is here today? 
[01:42:30]  The minor issue started...  Well...  Oh.  There's some degradation in quality of your mic there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's for sure.  You think it's the microphone itself?  Perhaps.  I have a new refurbished...  I have a new refurbished...  Refurbished.  Newly refurbished.  See, that's what we have to say around here.  Everything's refurbished.  Refurbished.  How about...  How about...  I have a new mic.  Whenever anyone says refurbished, aren't you like...  Oh, boy. 
[01:43:00]  I got a refurbished Xbox.  Oh, boy.  You know, the light's just blinking.  Right.  Do you want a refurbished vag?  It's got brand new stitches in it.  Yuck.  Refurbished.  How about we just get a furbished one?  Start there.  Yeah, exactly.  Get a refurbished.  So, can't you troubleshoot the mic by just using the mic that was here?  Yeah.  Plugging it in, going, hey, in somewhere else, and see if the mic was bad.  It won't sound as... 
[01:43:30]  This processing in this board is different from any other board.  Yeah, but you'll know if the mic is bad, right?  Right.  Yeah.  But would it sound good to you is the other question.  I say no.  I like this.  This sounds good.  You want to keep that one?  About your just-fuckin'?  No.  What are the issues, Mars, facing this studio?  Hmm.  What type of issues?  Like, negative issues?  No, no.  All the positives.  All the positives?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We still churn out great shows out of the Studio 11. 
[01:44:00]  No, but why are things breaking down in the studio?  Because they're old, decrepit, and need to be bought new.  Mars is fixing stuff with old World War II walkie-talkies.  It's some old shit, man.  Yes.  Yes.  You saw that CPU that runs the clock?  I'll get the CPU.  Ah, it's my CPU.  Yeah, I saw the CPU.  But we have to spend money in here.  It's what it is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was supposed to happen, though, right?  Yeah.  Well, it is actually happening. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  January.  That's what they're doing.  Hardy, hardy, hardy.  Hard, hard.  January.  Yep.  When the rest of these studios, all unspecial shows, are getting fixed in January.  All right.  Well, I think we're up and running, at least for the rest of the show.  Yep.  Yep.  I like that Donnie comes in here and fucking, you know.  And gets his hands dirty. 
[01:45:00]  Right in there, yeah.  Gets his fingers dirty.  Gets his hands dirty.  Like when he helps out in the bathroom.  Gets his hands dirty.  How will these phones go back on hold with the new mouse?  Yes.  They will go back on hold if you want them to.  I'm getting ready to punch.  If you want.  Screen goes next.  Okay.  John in Ohio.  Hey, John.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey. 
[01:45:30]  Johnnykins.  Have you ever seen the video?  It's when Marino first started at CBS Sports, and he fucks up horribly, like a line, and  he goes nuts and, like, slams the table, and the guys are staring at him like, he's insane.  Really?  Well, that tends to happen with broadcasters.  Yeah, right?  Who needs to watch that?  Right.  It tends to happen.  You get the live HD version.  I don't know if I've ever seen this one.  Here's the Dan Marino freakout on YouTube. 
[01:46:00]  I talked to my man, Terrell Buckley, last week in Miami.  He was on a bye week, by the way, playing golf.  He told me that defense is blocked.  Jesus.  Oh, boy.  He was doing, they were doing a taped segment.  Right.  And he blew his line, and got very upset.  Wow, okay.  Imagine having to hear the same dumb points over and over again.  I know, because then they have to take that over. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  It's like, yeah, well, I've been talking a little fucking shit.  And Terrell Buckley said that he's going to, uh, brr, brr, brr, brr.  These two cameras.  Yeah.  Yeah, so then, you know, he fucks up, then he can cut to him doing it again.  A little cutaway.  A little cutaway.  Dan Marino filed a lawsuit for publicity.  Dan Marino need publicity.  Exactly.  What publicity about what?  More renaissance spots?  I don't think he wants the NFL to be mad at him.  That's all he's had in his life.  Correctamundo. 
[01:47:00]  So, I don't think, I feel like he didn't have a choice.  I wonder if he'll settle for a job.  Like, if they offer him a job, will he settle?  Settle.  Settle down.  Settle down.  All right.  Enough about Dan Marino.  Holy shit.  I love to ask Florentine, because he worships Marino.  Yeah.  He does.  Yeah, I don't know.  He said he's had to be bummed out.  He had a tweet the other day.  Fuck, I wish I remembered it.  But every tweet from Florentine, you'd read it in his voice. 
[01:47:30]  Of course.  Perfect.  Dumb voice.  Why?  Where do you get that?  Sounds like throat cancer.  His brother Danny has the same voice.  Yeah?  Yeah.  A little bit off, but he sounds...  Really?  It looks just like Florentine.  Well, he's his brother.  Account suspended.  Oh, no.  Yeah, why is a grown man keeping score of a baseball game?  No reason. 
[01:48:00]  No reason.  That's the guy.  Yeah.  He's got a picture of a guy just filling out the stat sheets at the ball game.  I never understood those guys.  Yeah.  They sit there and have to, like, follow the game.  Yeah.  Ugh.  What do you do with those things after you...  Yeah.  What do you do with them?  Do you file them?  Oh, the K-banners.  That's another one.  The what?  I hate the guy in Major League Baseball games that brings K-banners with him and hangs  him up after every strikeout.  Yeah.  Please fall over the railing.  Did he say that? 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  But that was...  Please fall over the railing.  But that was cool when Doc Gooden did it.  Ah.  Back in the day.  It was always funny after the three, though.  Three strikeouts with Doc Gooden.  Because then you'd be like, oh, that's not very nice.  You know.  K-k-k.  There it is.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't get that whole filling out the stat sheet.  All right.  I think we did pretty good with this break, so...  Oh, yeah. 
[01:49:00]  We'll take another break and fucking regroup again.  Got good news for after the break, though.  Ooh.  John Sterling's brand new home run calls.  Oh, man.  I bet it's about him.  We've been collecting them.  Nice.  People like this.  Collect them all.  He's got a lot of new players, so he came up with brand new home run calls.  Can't wait.  We've got seven of them next.  Stay there.  All right.  All right, all right, all right. 
[01:49:30]  So...  We've got John Sterling doing his home run calls.  Oh.  I got scared for a second.  Sorry.  No, it's obviously...  I forgot you're all rewired all over the studio so we can broadcast today.  Indeed.  That makes sense.  Sure.  It's electric.  Does anyone else have studio problems in this place there, Mars, or is it just us?  No, every day there's studio problems. 
[01:50:00]  You're screaming.  Every day with other studios?  Yes, sir.  That's why I'm employed.  Every day.  Every day there's something.  There's something.  Oh, it's something.  So weird.  Less in this studio than any other studio.  Whoa.  What the hell's happening at that?  Really?  Other studios bursting into flames?  Holy fuck.  Practically.  So Mayface, you're going to consider the roads.  Can you dig that?  I know that you...  What the hell was that? 
[01:50:30]  It was fucking Billy Crystal doing that.  Is that old?  Or is he doing a new version?  Oh, no.  Is that from his show?  Yeah.  Five hundred Sundays?  Seven hundred.  It was good.  Whatever.  Ugh, he stinks.  Fuck.  One Sunday's too much with that fucking guy?  He's got a giant head.  Saw him at a restaurant in L.A.  He's got...  His head is ridiculously large.  Can you dig it?  Oh, I'm doing my black jazz musician character. 
[01:51:00]  Look how respectful I am.  You know what it means  To miss New Orleans  Cause that's where you left your heart  And there's one new home  Who thinks he's a song and dance man?  The ones I care for  More than I miss  New Orleans 
[01:51:30]  Baba Susan  Oh, don't close up  Oh, yeah  You're a white Jew  Stop it  Stop with the black guy act  What?  That's good stuff  Baba Zuba  Well, he did grow up with jazz musicians  I have to say  What?  Yeah, he was like Billy Holiday 
[01:52:00]  I think he knew when he was a kid  His father's record producer  Oh, wow  He didn't know Billy Holiday  Stop it  He did  It was one of them  Stop it  That's where he learned  Baba Zubabu  Baba Zubabu  Enough  Enough with him  Now look at Obama's face  What is going on with him?  Something's going on with Obama today  He's aging by the minute  A new scandal  A new scandal  Is happening with this soldier  Oh, God  This guy, yeah  Bird ball 
[01:52:30]  I don't know  It seems a little weird  That we would do that  Yeah  It's good for a soldier  And his family  But I wonder if that's going to put  Some of our guys in danger  Well, it sets a precedent  That I think is very dangerous  That if Americans are taken hostage  That they can negotiate  The release of  Right  Their buddies  Is this the first one we've done in a while?  Five guys  Five for one?  Five for one  Of questionable  Military integrity 
[01:53:00]  Let's just say  But how's his fastball?  I'm not sure  Well, five for one  He must have a good heater  He must, right?  Yeah, yeah  He must have a good heater  Well  He gave away five  From Guantanamo  And  I don't know  I don't know what to make of it yet  I think there's a lot going on  With this guy  This soldier  Apparently walked off his post  Yeah, to talk to  Taliban  Yeah, he was already saying  Certain things that 
[01:53:30]  Would leave people to believe  That perhaps he was  A little more  Sympathetic to the enemy's cause  So  Was he a collaborator?  Was he a deserter?  Was he a traitor?  So  So why  Why  This guy?  So why make the deal for this guy?  Right  There's a  There's a guy in Mexico  Right now  In a jail in Mexico  Is this the Marine?  Yeah  I mean his story is  That he made a wrong turn  Ended up on the line  To get into Mexico  Said I have weapons in the back 
[01:54:00]  I didn't mean to come this way  Right  And they arrested him  Wait, wasn't he in Mexico  And trying to get back in?  Like that  That's the question  Like  Because he was arrested  I heard  No, I heard it was  He was going in  Or something  Or got in  I heard he made the wrong turn  Right  And got in  I heard he made the wrong turn  And all of a sudden realized  Oh shit  Oh shit  So then he was coming back  The other way or whatever  And then had to tell him  I got guns  Just want to let you know  And then  He's been down there  About a month  Yeah  I was told I was a piece of shit  For going to Mexico  Because of that  Oh yeah 
[01:54:30]  Why?  Even though I didn't even know  I didn't even know  About all these things  I think it's longer than a month  Certainly the haters  Will find anything  You're a piece of shit  So I'm a piece of shit  For going to Mexico  While this guy's being detained  I didn't even know  About the story  Until I got home  What's going on with him?  He's still there  He's still there  I mean  Let's say hi to Patrick  He's once on the show  Because he's calling  From a weird place  Oh we love weird places  Patrick you're calling  From a weird place  Where are you calling from?

There's all new lines blinking.  Cool.  No one's filled in any.  We're fine.  Hello?  Hello.  Welcome back.  Hi.  Who's this?  Well, this is Shiv from Exotic New Jersey.  Hi.  Shiv?  Yeah.  I heard you went to my bunk once.  As long as the show is sort of peering out today, I just have a couple observations. 
[02:03:00]  This could be like a test call.  Cool.  Well, you know, Sam never mentioned to Anthony that, you know, there is someone named Seven,  Seven Costanza.  He's supposed to be in the 411 here, and he never really told you there's a Seven Streeter.  Very disappointed in Sam.  Okay.  Secondly.  Oh, boy.  Also, he sounds like Sid the Science Kid, so maybe you could waste a couple minutes on that.  Well, we already did, apparently.  Shit.  Yeah. 
[02:03:30]  Sir, bad call.  It's just a bad call.  You think that's a good call?  Bad call.  Doesn't matter.  Da-da-da-da-da.  Hi, Bob.  But at least the phone is working.  Well, without saying.  I think it's frozen.  We got the, if you go to the O and A Show Twitter, which is O and A Show, you get to see  the mouse that they were.  Oh, that's a good pick right there.  Not really.  It's not an old picture.  Don't be confused by the age of that mouse. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  We have a little update on the phones as to why there's no names and stuff coming up  on your screen.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  The phone screen and computer in the other room is completely frozen.  So, that is in the reboot phase right now.  Who's the asshole at this company that decided to not redo this studio to save a few bucks?  I want to apologize for hacking into the microphone.  I hit the cough button.  You say that every day.  Yeah. 
[02:04:30]  I hit the cough button.  Right.  So, I wouldn't cough into the microphone.  But it's for that mic, which I'm using now.  That's so good.  How do you think I feel?  I don't have one.  Well, you don't.  I like you.  You're the only one that has a cough button.  I know, because I cough a lot.  Take excellent.  You'd be too scared to cough.  I don't enjoy shit.  God bless.  I know.  I miss God bless.  God bless.  Yeah.  Wow.  Damn. 
[02:05:00]  I hack into the mic every day.  Oh, that's so mean.  I didn't mean it.  It's just a funny term.  Oh, my God.  Sam, what's going on?  Is the walkabout done?  Yeah, Mars is back from walkabout.  He's now trying to reboot the call screen.  The call screen.  The call screen.  The call screen computer.  Is this a moment of leisure over?  He's like the little boy with his finger in the dike.  Things are getting a little stressful in there.  It looks like he may be going back on walkabout.  Why wouldn't E-Rock turn on a mic so we could hear Mars stressing out? 
[02:05:30]  He hasn't said anything.  It's been very quiet in here.  Exactly.  Give us the vibe.  Give us the vibe.  Get him talking.  Siesta.  It's very serious in here.  Sal's laughing at him.  Sal, why are you laughing?  Yeah.  It's just funny.  This whole fucking thing is hysterical.  Oh, hysterical?  Oh, God.  Well, I'm glad.  The funniest part was, I don't know, I guess watching Mars get a little flustered.  I'm sorry.  It's fun to watch him get a little flustered.  Why is Mars flustered, Don Wicklin?  Flustered?  Because he doesn't know what he's doing. 
[02:06:00]  Whoa!  You heard that, Mars?  Mars, you hear that?  Don said you don't know what you're doing.  Wow.  He said, Mars is flustered because he doesn't know what he's doing.  All right.  Damn.  What did he say?  This is crazy.  He's pulling his pants up like Al Del Vecchio in Happy Day.  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.  He said, I'll go over here.  Yeah.  I'll just go over here.  Yeah.  Walking over there.  Watching Mars fix things is like watching a third baseman pitch.  Mars? 
[02:06:30]  How's it going, Mars?  What if I say that?  Just say it.  Oh, shit.  Wait, wait.  What?  Who's fault?  It's not on Sam's mic.  What are you doing?  There's no mic.  If I said that, what?  What happens?  Come on, there's a bus.  What was he supposed to say?  It's all fixed.  Mars fixed it.  It's all fixed.  Try it, Obi.  I see.  That's not true.  It's not fixed.  Why are you holding up the wall now?  Oh, he said it's the intern.  Oh, no!  Shit!  Why are you throwing...  Why'd you throw an intern on the mic? 
[02:07:00]  Mars, microphone.  This is a radio show.  You got to talk into Sam's mic.  I didn't say it was the intern.  What happened?  What happens every time?  Speak your mind.  Mars, whatever.  Every time we have a new intern, we have problems with the fucking associate producer.  And I'm not saying it's the intern.  Are you saying it's Sal?  I'm saying it's Sal.  Who trained the intern?  Eric and Sal.  That is true.  You can't blame somebody.  Shut up, Don.  Don't try to add to this.  I did not just hear that.  Not at all. 
[02:07:30]  He said, shut up, Don.  The interns did nothing wrong on this phone.  Wow.  The ones that have been on here have interned at this company before.  Hey, Eric, with all due respect, that desktop director, the phone, was in talent.  Okay, well, who adjusted that then?  Because the interns didn't touch it.  Mars' fly was open.  What is the talent thing, though? 
[02:08:00]  What was he doing wrong?  Talent thing.  Yeah, what's talent?  Exactly.  There's no mic there.  What if he didn't turn up narcoleps, he was falling asleep to having a button?  Talent mode just takes over what you're doing.  I'll tell you right now, Sam, I don't think Jack White's going to...  Get some high-fives for today's show.  Not on this one.  Talent mode takes over what Opie does on the phone? 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, on the desktop director.  Yeah.  You have to choose producer or talent.  So, when it goes...  Is that what was sending it to hold?  Why?  What would happen?  Whatever she's doing overrides what he's doing.  Yeah, but why would she be putting people on hold while they're talking to him?  I have no idea.  I'm just telling you what I saw when I went to the desktop director.  She did that?  Oh, shit.  I didn't say she did that.  The desktop director who was that.  When I went to the fucking desktop director, it was under talent.  Stop saying that.  How many more times do I have to say it, though? 
[02:09:00]  I don't like him saying desktop director.  Exactly.  He probably throws out meetings and no one knows who there's the other.  He must be on the...  The DD.  Yeah.  That's not entirely true, because it was in passive.  Everyone here saw it in passive.  Not in passive?  Oh!  He said it was in passive.  What was in passive?  He said the thing you're lying about was in passive.  What was in passive?  It's not in passive.  There is no passive on the desktop.  It was in passive, and it only had the option to select talent.  Oh, no.  Passive.  That's in cursive. 
[02:09:30]  Mars, two guys calling you a liar right now.  That's right.  One and a half.  They're not saying that it was...  A lying Puerto Rican they called you.  They're not saying it's in PR.  When they're not in...  Yeah, lying PR.  Is that what they called it?  Yes.  Here's Roland with a Jonah Hill update, by the way.  Oh, God.  This can only be perfect.  Well, he just wandered by.  Oh, there he is.  We got our Jonah Hill update.  We're going to go get him right now.  He's so full of shit.  He just rolled his eyes and walked out.  He said, I'm going to go get him right now, and then rolled his eyes. 
[02:10:00]  Then did Jackie Gleason eyes.  I want to agree with Mars.  I trust Mars and think that...  Who bless you.  Are we fixed?  That was in...  Talent.  Operator error?  Yes.  Instead of passive, whatever that means.  No, producer.  No, it's got to be in passive, though.  Talk about the desktop director again.  And does the associate producer know the desktop director?  And what's an associated...  Associate producer.  What's an associate producer?  It's that software that you use to pick up and...  Oh, I thought it was a person.  Not even a person? 
[02:10:30]  I did, too.  And the desktop director's not a person?  No.  That's a hard-wired...  I went to college for that.  Isn't Don the desktop director?  Yeah.  It's called assistant producer.  Oh, shit.  You didn't even get that.  You got it on Mars.  You don't even know the technology.  Oh, Mars.  You did a bunch of times.  What program are we using?  Window Shades 98?  Yesterday, a couple days ago, Mars said that everybody was not working well together because people 
[02:11:00]  were just on a different sheet of music.  Why would you say that?  Why would you say that?  What does that mean?  That's horrible.  Is that like everyone's playing something differently?  Correct.  He and I were just on a different sheet of music.  Who's on a different sheet of music?  Explain that.  Just the phrase.  Yeah.  A different sheet of music.  Explain that.  The phrase.  Well, the phrase means that, you know, you're all playing on the same sheet of music.  You're all on the band and playing the same song.  Why are you on the band?  Exactly.  What do you want to try and help with the drummer? 
[02:11:30]  Are you on the band?  Some sheet of music.  You're playing a song right now called You're Embarrassing Yourself.  So is everyone huddled around one music stand on one sheet of music?  We should all be on the same sheet of music.  All their instruments banging together.  Everybody gets their own sheet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Tim Sabian.  Uh-oh.  Oh, shit.  Uh-oh.  Now heads are going to roll.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Uh-oh.  Jack, it's buttoned too tightly.  Oh, man.  There you go. 
[02:12:00]  Tim gives up quick.  Don just goes, shit's fixed, and then Tim just chomped his gum and kept going.  Blew right by, didn't he?  Turn on the mic, Eric.  Turn it on now.  Boss wants it on.  What's this?  What do you want to do?  People have just heard kissing.  Deep.  Deep tongue-kissing with whiskers rubbing together.  Oh, yeah.  He watched neck being tickled gently.  Turgeon pole against his rump.  He left. 
[02:12:30]  He left.  Iraq, what's the deal with you and all these foods you're testing out?  He's talking awesome, isn't it?  What are you testing out?  I've been watching, yeah, his Instagram.  Iraq consumer reviews.  Consumer reviews.  What is he doing?  He's fucking...  What happened to the diet?  He's eating the worst food in the world and reviewing it.  What are you eating?  Like it's for a purpose.  You mean you didn't enjoy the SpaghettiOs with taco sauce review?  That seemed like I don't know how you would even buy that.  What happened to you?  You buy it to try it.  There's the test burritos. 
[02:13:00]  SpaghettiOs, that should be your consumer reviews motto.  Buy it to try it.  Look, yeah, it's spelled B-I-E.  That's what he ate.  Spaghetti...  Oh, that's a real thing, I thought.  Yeah.  The taco SpaghettiOs.  It was awful?  It was awful.  It's SpaghettiOs in Taco Bell sauce.  It was gross.  But you thought, you gotta try it to buy it, right?  Right.  Gotta buy it to try it.  Oh, sorry.  Sounds good.  And then what else is there?  Those Doritos that were like the jacked?  Yeah, they're doing these mystery flavors.  Yes. 
[02:13:30]  And then you get to, like, vote and maybe they do another flavor.  They're all garbage.  Oh, that's good.  They're all horrible.  Did you vote for the president or any of the midterm elections?  Uh, the president?  Yes.  Okay.  No midterm elections?  Good.  Vote on your Doritos jacked fucking bag.  America.  America.  Oh, and some Capri Sun.  That's a nice...  For adults.  For adults.  What do you mean for adults?  They're a bigger size and they're resealable.  And you can, uh, conceal alcohol in it if you want. 
[02:14:00]  There's people surfing and skateboarding on the back here.  Yeah, what kind of adults?  You mix in some vodka or some rum into it and...  Uh, do they...  Does it have a straw...  Does it have a straw on the side?  Um...  Do you poke a straw through the top?  No, you do not.  Okay.  I was gonna say.  Happy birthday, frosting, chips ahoy.  What's that?  Is the diet on the waist, kind of on the side?  What diet?  That diet has fucking been executed.  What happened with the diet?  What I see on Instagram.  You were doing good.  Starting an industry here. 
[02:14:30]  Are you?  Yeah.  Yeah, what is this?  For fucking nitroglycerin?  I must say.  What else is there?  Birthday frosting filled chips ahoy.  I did not try that.  It's chewy chips ahoy.  That sounds horrible.  But they decided Oreo cream needed to fill the bucket.  Not birthday.  That birthday fucking flavor stinks on everything.  Like birthday cake flavor?  No.  Now, what else is there?  Slush puppies.  You put it in too many things.  Slush.  Cherry slush puppies.  What are those, E-Rock? 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  The, um, you know, in some, um, retail marts and gas stations, they'd have the big slush  puppy machine.  Oh, right.  It's like their version of Slurpees.  Like Slurpees.  And, uh, they made little portable ones where you just throw it in the freezer for an hour  and then you take it on the go.  Slush puppies blow.  They do.  They suck.  Did you drink it too fast and get rock freeze?  Because he has no brain.  It's a rock.  But he is branded.  Did you get the size of a walnut freeze?  Like a stegosaurus?  E-Rock Radio on Instagram. 
[02:15:30]  Ah!  Nice.  He's branding.  He's got hashtag the consumer.  He is.  What was your best thing you've tried so far with this new bit?  Um, some of these, uh, hard ciders have been really good.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I'm trying to get into, uh, the world of, uh, size 40.  Sorry, E-Rock.  Where does Mr. Cider live?  Hard.  He's hard.  Yeah.  No, he means Snyder.  He's being raped by the fucking guy from One Day at a Time. 
[02:16:00]  I just get it.  Yes.  Okay, uh, this one says, hashtag, uh-oh, SpaghettiOs is right.  New cheeseburger flavor was very hopeful and comes off disappointing.  A slight cheeseburger taste, but comes off as bland as Chef Boyardee's version.  Hashtag, the consumer.  Wow!  You're reviewing cheesy burger.  I'm saving you time and money.  He's, he's reviewing Chef Boyardee's cheeseburger macaroni.  You gotta, like, do videos, though. 
[02:16:30]  What are you doing?  Have you tried it out and then you've got to talk to the camera?  Yes.  You're over-complicating it.  No.  No.  No.  Let's do quick 15-second Instagram videos.  Thank you, Travis.  That would be cool.  Do you want to try one, E-Rock?  I would.  You just do that.  I want to see it.  I definitely want to see it.  All right.  I still have more product to try.  But what do you, what's on the, uh, what's on the palate today?  Uh, what do we have?  There's, uh, there's a new barbecue pork beef jerky that came out.  I'm going to try that.  Oh. 
[02:17:00]  How did you build yourself a gig?  This is what happens at home.  His wife gives him the look.  He's like, what?  It's for my hashtag.  My hashtag.  Is that beef that's special for you?  What's it called?  Beef jerky.  He's a jerk.  I do like a good piece of beef jerky.  Yes.  So I'm excited to try that later.  What else?  What else you got?  Kraft macaroni and cheese has some new flavors.  They have buffalo chicken. 
[02:17:30]  They have chipotle spice and jalapeno.  Enough of the chipotle on everything.  You're tired of it.  You're putting it in everything.  Stop.  The phone was sent to chipotle.  I got very good news, guys.  I got very good news.  There's a fire in the building?  In this studio.  The show's over.  Things are fixed?  Very good news.  We're going to test the phones right now.  All right.  Hi, who's this?  Hi, how you doing?  It's me.  It's Lady Di.  How's everything? 
[02:18:00]  Lady Di.  She can't even say it.  She's French now.  Lady Di.  Oh, I said Lady.  Lady Di.  No, you slurred it.  What?  Oh, what?  We really thought it was Lady Di.  No, no.  It's Lady Di.  It's Lady Di.  Hi, how's everything?  How are you doing?  Um, how was your vacation?  That little vacation you took.  This?  Oh.  She said, oh.  Anthony, Anthony.  What?  I know what you did on vacation.  It's on Facebook. 
[02:18:30]  Is it?  Wow.  I didn't think I'd post it.  Wow, in the year 2014.  I know.  Something to make it to Facebook.  Another thing I was not invited to.  And then she chuckles like that.  I mean, that's okay.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah, that's okay.  They only allow one whale at a time in my suite.  Oh.  I mean to two people.  See, I was a whale.  No.  See, I was a whale because I was betting a lot.  He's spending a lot of money.  She's a fat pig.  She's a fat pig.  He's calling you a whale because you indulge in a lot of food and litter. 
[02:19:00]  Yes.  Yes.  All right.  I had a good idea.  I bet you did.  All of a sudden a gunshot rings out.  We all say she was right.  I had a good idea.  I had a good idea.  Let me finish the sentence.  Oh, shut up.  You fucking monster.  Me, me, me.  No, no, no.  It ain't me, me, me.  How many beers have you had so far this morning?  You sound tanked.  I knew you were going to ask that.  Oh, did you?  Did you really know that we were going to ask that today? 
[02:19:30]  I was talking to Lou from Jersey last night.  Ooh.  Lou from Jersey.  Who the fuck's Lou from Jersey?  Nice work, Lou.  Yeah.  Going to Jersey?  Maybe.  Maybe.  And I told him the same thing I'm going to tell you right now.  Opie, you're the one that always asks me, okay, how many beers have I had so far this  morning?  And you want to know how many beers I had?  This is my third one.  Why would you tell Lou that?  Why the Lou fucking preface? 
[02:20:00]  Why does Lou have to deal with your nonsense?  I mentioned this to Lou.  Why are you talking to Lou?  Who's Lou?  Oh, no.  He's a guy from...  Amazingly, the phones are working perfectly now.  Right?  You know what?  Why wouldn't the phone crap out?  No, he's a really nice person.  He really is.  Who cares?  Who's Lou from Jersey?  Give the fuck why give this is so...  Lou from Jersey.  I don't know.  Who cares?  Why did you have to tell us that you talked to Lou from Jersey before you just told us  your little fucking story? 
[02:20:30]  Who is he?  Where did you get...  Where were you talking to Lou from Jersey?  I got him from Twitter and we became friends and I, you know, we called him.  I called him Len.  I know.  Is it Blue Blue Boyle?  No.  No, Jimmy.  No, no, no, no, no.  What does that mean?  What does that mean, what Jimmy just said?  What?  What did he just say anyway?  Holy intoxicated disaster. 
[02:21:00]  She's a fucking disaster.  No, I'm not a disaster.  No, you are a disaster.  Okay, I'm a disaster.  Okay, what did you just say to the disaster?  Jimmy, what did you just say?  I'm looking at anything but this conversation.  Do you understand my ears are on vacation right now?  I can't hear you.  My ears are relaxing right now.  One is just pretending that symbols are being banged next to it. 
[02:21:30]  I wanted to tell you something.  What do you want to tell us?  Did you tell Lou first?  What did Lou approve of this information?  Is it Lou approved?  No, no, you guys.  You guys.  I wanted to tell you this.  Yeah.  Okay.  I guarantee it's going to be complete nonsense.  Waste.  Other shit.  Waste of time, energy, everything.  All right, go ahead.  Go ahead.  What?  Okay.  The next time Colin Quinn and I are on the show together, or even if he calls in, 
[02:22:00]  okay, we could do a duet together, you know, like singing, duet.  You were wrong, Opie.  It was not a waste of time.  No, and we could sing the song from Dirty Dancing, I Had the Time of My Life.  Oh, my God.  Wouldn't that be a good idea?  No, it wouldn't.  What's on in the background?  I prefer you saying, I'm at the end of. 
[02:22:30]  What's on in the background?  What in the background?  No, I'm serious.  Wouldn't that be a good idea?  What is on in the background?  How'd the phone get fixed for this?  I'm so kidding.  What's going on?  Hold on, hold on.  I got the TV on.  Are you talking to me?  Who do you think we're talking to?  Just fill up a tub and throw it in?  What's on the TV? 
[02:23:00]  Oh, Kelly and Michael.  I always watch that show.  How fun.  What a nice life you have.  Yeah.  No worries in the world.  Yeah, it's all right.  No worries.  When was the last time you smoked crack?  It's a good show to watch when you're fucking cleaning shit off your bedsheets.  Two years and a month ago, all right?  Two years.  Two years ago.  Two years ago.  You keep on asking me that question.  And the answer's different every time.  Yeah, well, of course it's going to be different. 
[02:23:30]  It's going to be almost three years pretty soon.  Not if it's only two years, one month.  Eleven months.  That's going to be three years.  I don't do drugs like that.  So what?  You're able to advance time by not doing drugs?  You're a waste.  No, I just don't do drugs.  That's it.  Let me go to Eric in Boston.  Eric, go ahead.  Hey, I just wanted to comment on E-Rock's little segment there.  Yeah.  Instead of a phantom gourmet, I think he's a fat, dumb gourmet.  Oh, wow.  Geez. 
[02:24:00]  E-Rock is a nice man.  He's a very nice person.  He's neither of those things.  E-Rock is a nice guy.  Come on.  Okay.  Anything else before we...  Yeah, we've got to, like, move on today.  Move on.  We've had a really bad show.  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  The thing with Colin Quinn and I...  Doesn't that sound like a good idea?  I had forgotten you even said it.  As far as good ideas go, it doesn't...  No, it's not a good idea. 
[02:24:30]  Why would that be good?  Do your part.  Do your part.  Do your part.  Do your part.  How about you do your part?  Yeah, why not?  Do your part for society and hang yourself.  Sing this song right now.  Go ahead.  Yes.  Lady Di.  Because I had the time of my life, and I owe it all to you.  She's looking at her fucking beer. 
[02:25:00]  I must have saw this movie about a thousand times.  No one cares.  More no one cares info.  Stick to the pertinent shit.  From the movie Dirty Bedding.  Dirty Duns Angel.  Get ready for her to answer, yeah?  I've been waiting for so long.  Now I've finally found someone to stand by me.  Over waiting for so long.  Ta-da. 
[02:25:30]  Saw the writing on the wall.  I need a little practice at it.  Then it's not a good idea.  You're not ready.  I need a little practice.  I mean, it's been a while since I saw it, so.  Everyone knows the dumb song.  I just practice at it.  All right.  Can we go on then?  No.  No, we can't go.  Jennifer Grey on these.  I also saw all five Rockies on Sunday.  They took all five of them.  Jesus.  What a fucking non-contributor. 
[02:26:00]  I saw all five Rockies on Sunday.  Yeah, I did.  What a waste.  They were pretty good.  They were all still good.  It was a beautiful day Sunday.  Why would you stay in and watch all five Rockies?  Well, they started to come on.  All right.  I believe it was like 12 or 1 o'clock.  Wait, you watched them on television?  That's hilarious.  Yeah.  No one puts baby Huey in a corner.  That is hilarious.  Oh, my God. 
[02:26:30]  Do you guys understand?  She watched all five Rockies on TV.  You know how long that would take?  Oh, that is a long answer.  What channel?  It was on cable.  On cable.  I forget what a channel.  It's not even mean in this day and age.  It was on cable.  Right.  You watch everything on fucking cable.  It's just your TV at this point.  Did you watch five movies back-to-back with commercials?  Oh.  Yeah.  What time did you start watching all five Rockies?  Oh, boy.  Let me see. 
[02:27:00]  Two, four, six, eight.  Two, four, six, eight, ten.  About ten hours worth of Rockies.  Well, I fell asleep during Rocky IV, so.  It's called passing out.  But you woke up for Rocky V, everybody.  Yeah, I woke up for Rocky V.  And it was more than ten hours if it was on regular TV.  Oh, wait.  It wasn't.  Well, if it was on cable.  How about Rocky Balboa?  That's Rocky VI.  Yep.  No.  Rocky VI, no.  No.  I never went down.  No.  No.  No.  What's your problem with Rocky VI? 
[02:27:30]  The problem is, it was, you know, I saw it twice.  And I really did not, you know, the first time I saw it, I, you know, it was like, it  was kind of like boring in a way.  So that's the first one where Rocky's punching her in the meat locker.  How would you, how would you know?  She's a cow.  How would you know boring?  Yeah.  It was a boring movie.  Do you understand you're boring everyone right now?  So how would you know boring?  Yeah.  He was talking about, you know, if I remember correctly, he was talking about, you know, 
[02:28:00]  his life and everything like that.  And, and, uh, it was just, I don't know.  It was just kind of weird.  He was, he was managing, uh, another boxer and everything.  Great review.  What do you think of the Broadway musical?  Uh, you know what?  I, I want to go to that.  I would really love to go to that.  I really would.  Imagine that.  I mean, no, no, no.  I'm just telling you, Rocky.  You should send her so she can do a review.  Rocky was like.  This is the equivalent of watching literally paint dry. 
[02:28:30]  Paint, yeah, paint dry.  This is like the worst.  Or paint chips to be eaten.  My two favorite Rockies.  Oh.  Oh, guys.  We're going to.  Rocky 5.  What?  Which ones?  Dennis.  2 and 5.  And the squirrel.  Retard.  Guys, good news.  Her favorite Rockies are Rocky 2 and Rocky 5.  Good thing.  Now I can live my life today.  Rocky 2 and Rocky 5.  Why Rocky 2 and Rocky 5?  Because Rocky 2, he wins against Apollo and Rocky 5, he street fights the guy, Tommy Morrison. 
[02:29:00]  Who's now dead.  And I thought they were, no, I thought they were good movies.  Both of them.  You ever seen Clubber Lang with Apollo, with Rocky 3?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I hope I didn't give away any endings.  You did.  Spoiler alert.  Oh, God.  I'm about to give away your ending.  The other Rockies were good, too.  The other ones were good, but I'm just saying my two favorites were Rocky 2 and Rocky 5.  Iraq, comment.  We should send her to the musical, because, you know, she couldn't be in here 10 minutes 
[02:29:30]  without having to take a shit.  Imagine being in the middle of the theater.  Right.  Dead center.  God.  How many shits did you take while you watched Rockies 1 through 5?  Guys, I know you're thinking, how could this get better?  No.  I know you're thinking.  I already know.  The phone's dying.  Nope.  Lou from Jersey is now on the line.  Really?  Lou.  You're a big star today, Lou.  Good morning, fellas.  How are you?  Are you the one that actually talked to Lady Di?  Yes, I was.  This is a big get for the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah.  We're not getting Jonah Hill today, but we found Lou from Jersey.  Yeah.  I appreciate that.  Go ahead, Di.  All right, buddy.  Big fan here.  Go.  Well, I had Lady Di on the Rocky 5.  I mean, I think Rocky 5 is a good move.  That's right.  Why do you talk to Lady Di, Lou?  You can't, Di.  Lou.  I was just tweeting last night, had a few drinks, and decided to agree with Lady Di on the Rocky 5.  But what kind of conversation did you have with Lady Di when she called you? 
[02:30:30]  Were you guys sexting or any of that shit?  No.  My girlfriend is listening to this.  That did not happen.  Oh.  So, uh, it's not that I like that.  I'm going to get into deep shit.  Hang him out there.  So, uh.  Nothing like that.  Come on.  All right.  Can we go now?  Now that we got Lou?  No, you can't go.  Di, you ever seen that musical, Wicked?  Um, no. 
[02:31:00]  What was the last Broadway show I ever saw, I believe, was either Moving Out or Taboo.  I think it was, you know, in that order, I think it was Taboo.  What the hell is Taboo?  It was very short-lived.  It was a play with Boy George.  That's what Tad does.  Oh, and she played you on the bus? 
[02:31:30]  No.  No.  No?  No, no, no.  She didn't play me on the bus.  Right.  Unless we think it really happened that way.  It was a play with Boy George in it.  Marion and I went.  Oh, that must have been a treat.  Can you imagine paying for a ticket and having to deal with the lady dying Marion in the audience?  At an obviously bad Broadway show.  Wow.  One ticket had to be $150.  How many confrontations did tough guy Marion get into? 
[02:32:00]  On the way to the theater.  We're just talking.  We're just talking here.  Shut up.  We're just a comic chameleon.  No.  Oh, it was not like that.  Oh.  It wasn't like that at all.  No, no, no.  We had a good time at the play.  Yeah.  Why was it a good time?  It was a good time because we were watching it and, you know, and it was good.  And Boy George, you know, like.  This radio program never met a crutch we didn't like. 
[02:32:30]  I fucking love this.  We went around the corner.  We went around the corner.  It's just complete and utter babble.  Yeah.  We went around the corner.  We bought him roses and we put him on the stage.  You bought Boy George roses?  What is wrong with you?  You think he had a shot?  There's nothing wrong with me.  You know he likes to cut.  Put him on the stage?  Why would you put roses on the stage?  Elvis had panties thrown at him.  Boy George has these monsters putting flowers. 
[02:33:00]  Has the fucking gargantuans.  What do you think could happen to those roses?  Do you know how long ago that was?  What do you think happened to the roses?  What do you think happened to the roses?  I don't know.  They're probably gone right now, obviously.  They were gone five minutes after you put them on the stage.  They threw them in the garbage.  He never saw them.  There are six Rockies, not five, by the way.  But we know that.  He did see them.  Yes, Lou.  Opie, actually, I wanted to talk about something relevant with you.  You've been getting a lot of shit for all these Ranger fans, Colin. 
[02:33:30]  1979, Rangers lose the Stanley Cup.  Islanders win the next four consecutive years.  Yeah, I know my history.  But the problem is the Rangers have a Stanley Cup and the Islanders don't.  Last time, you know, the Islanders...  Whatever, who gives a fuck?  Did the Islanders ever have a Stanley Cup?  That's a good question.  Who gives a fuck?  And what did that dummy say?  She asked if the Islanders ever won the Stanley Cup.  Did the Islanders ever win the Stanley Cup?  They never had a Stanley Cup.  Hi, Sam.  Hey, Dye. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  I don't know.  Did they?  I'm not asking you.  I guess they did.  Lou already said they did.  Okay, very good.  You know, your new friend Lou that you were sexting with, but his girlfriend can't find out about it?  First of all, don't get the guy in trouble.  We were not sexting.  Keeping her in the stable, are you?  Just in case you want to take a little dip.  No, no, no, no.  Yeah.  No.  God.  No.  Oh, God. 
[02:34:30]  I don't think so.  How do you, what are you the one saying no?  Right.  You shouldn't say no to anything.  You don't have anything.  You don't have a boyfriend.  You don't have a fucking sex life.  You're nothing.  If Lou wanted to throw you a little dick in.  Right.  You'd grab it up in a second.  Who's over to that?  At this point, you shouldn't even say no to a doorknob.  Right.  Can we go now, Lady Di, please?  No, you can't.  Stop holding us hostage.  Where's your abusive roommate?  Oh, he was waiting last night.  You what?  What? 
[02:35:00]  What?  Who, what?  You went back to Crown Chicken, Di?  That's the site where you bought a drug?  No.  No, I did not.  Lou, you went to the ATM.  Yeah, no, I told you, the second time I went to Crown Chicken, I went to the ATM.  All right?  The second time.  Why would you go to an ATM near the place you got mugged?  She bought drugs.  Unless you were going there to get drugs. 
[02:35:30]  It was early, and I had to get the money out.  Look, you stupid twat.  I'm not a dumb enabler.  I know what you're doing.  Yeah, you're getting drugs.  You're buying drugs.  Let everyone else listen to your stupid stories and make believe they're real.  No, it's the truth.  No, you're going to get drugs if you're going back to an ATM near Crown Chicken where you're mugged.  With Bill's fucking ATM card.  Right.  I'm not a family member or a friend and go, oh, that seems like it was a possibility.  There's a possibility.  Oh, that seems reasonable. 
[02:36:00]  I believe your story.  No, I went there to get money so this wife can go to Bayway Liquors.  All right?  There's a million ATMs in this world.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, the two.  So you go to the place where you got mugged.  Yeah, well, that was really dumb of me.  I shouldn't have done that.  No, it's not dumb because you're going there for other reasons.  It's not so obvious.  No, no, no.  Anthony, no.  Come on, man.  Oh, okay.  Me too, then.  I say it. 
[02:36:30]  I'm telling you, if you ever want to give me a drug test, go right ahead.  All right, Luke, can you go?  Likely test animals for rabies.  Thank you, Opie, for making my 10 minutes of fame absolutely miserable.  All right, ladies.  Come on, Lou.  All right, all right.  What about that idea with Colin Quinn and I?  Lou, there's a monster in here, Lou.  Okay.  Mayor, Murray, did you see the monster?  I saw the monster, Lou. 
[02:37:00]  Hey, what about that idea with Colin and I?  It's bad.  That's a dumb idea.  Yeah.  But, of course, Colin would love it.  Knowing Colin, he's all in.  Oh, sing a song.  Oh, let them know.  Another movie.  Good idea.  Guy, have you ever seen Les Mis?  No, I have not.  What about Jersey Boys?  No, no, no, believe me.  What about Cats?  Miss Saigon.  What about Rent?

Mamma Mia, Mamma Mia.  Showboat?  Mamma Mia, let me go.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Yeah.  Cole Porter's Anything Goes?  Anything Goes?  Oh, yeah.  You see Anything Goes?  No, the other, other play that I saw.  What about Jekyll and Hyde?  Will you let me finish?  Bridges of Madison County? 
[02:38:00]  Oh, that's a good one.  No, I did not.  The musical.  You did?  I can't remember.  How was that one?  Was that good?  What?  Which one?  No, I did not see that.  You ever see the producers?  The only one that I saw was movie.  You see the revival of Cabaret?  You ever see assistant producer?  It's on the phones.  You ever see desktop fucking director?  Did you see Phantom of the Opera?  That one you must have saw.  That was good.  That was pretty good, right?  No.  You know, I did not.  Blue Man Group.  Go off Broadway a little bit.  They needed the money? 
[02:38:30]  No?  No, I never saw any of those plays.  That's the one you just mentioned.  The one that I did see, you know, other than the one I just mentioned.  Moving Out?  Yeah, Moving Out.  The one about Billy Joel.  She does seem moving out.  Hey, what was your favorite song?  My favorite song from Billy Joel.  Oh, God.  Oh, boy.  I have so many of them.  It's still rock and roll to me.  I don't know.  You just picked the worst Billy Joel song. 
[02:39:00]  It's still rock and roll to me.  It's still rock and roll to me.  That's a terrible Billy Joel song.  It's a horrible Billy Joel song.  No, it's not.  What's the matter?  There it is.  Oh, this song sucks.  I like this one.  This one is horrible as far as Billy Joel's catalog goes.  What's the matter with the blues?  Can't you tell how to shit my pants?  So many better songs. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  She's just yapping over it.  Yeah.  Amazing that the phones are working perfectly.  Yeah.  Of course they are now.  Rock and roll.  All right, Lady Di, we're going to go.  Look at this song.  We're going to go, all right?  Okay.  Book of Mormon.  Oh, yeah.  Fiddle on the roof.  Oh, fiddle on the roof.  Fiddle on the roof.  Fiddle on the roof.  I did not see any of those.  What about the Book of Mormon?  Lady Di collapses the roof.  I got a pig on my house.

Oh, Death of a Salesman you must have saw.  The Tearjerker.  That's one you probably saw.  Oh, God.  I think he saw my movie.  How was that one?  You ever see Annie?  No, I have not.  On Broadway?  I'm telling you.  You never fully dressed without a smile, Di.  Yep.  No, I haven't.  I'm telling you, those are the only two plays that I ever saw.

Come on, Danny.  Why not?  Wake that prick up.  No, no, no, no, no.  Let's wake up.  Piece of shit.  Let's wake up Bill.  Because this phone call went nowhere, and I think you need to wake up Bill to save our  radio show today.  Die.  Hold on.  Could you before?  All right, wait, wait.  She's going to do it. 
[02:44:00]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Die.  What?  We're at Lady Di one-man band.  Yeah.  That's what I was thinking.  Or something.  You got anything?  Just put the bell on your neck you normally wear.  You got anything that'll make a lot of noise besides your yappa?  You got pots and pans, Die?  What do you got?  My television set.  Okay, knock it over.  No, no.  Then we won't hear it.  Yeah, throw it.  Put your hand through it.  Then we won't hear Bill.  Okay, hold on a second.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Clang your pots and pans together.  Bill.  Bill.  Bill.

You know, he usually goes to sleep after we eat, so, you know, I'll just leave him alone.  He goes to sleep after you eat?  After you eat breakfast?  Yeah.  They're like the fucking Addams Family over there.  Hold on.  Hold on a second.  Hold on.  I got to get a beer.  Hold on.  Of course.  You ever seen Once? 
[02:45:30]  Once?  I got it.  Horrible.  Yeah.  And they're not even together anymore.  All those songs, all those supposed love songs from that fucking show, they hate each  other now.

[02:46:00]  Kinky Boots.  You see Kinky Boots?  Stinky Boots.  What shows have you seen, man?  Rock of Ages, you said.  No, I did not say Rock of Ages.  Oh, you saw Rock of Ages.  How was that?  Wait, wait, Die.  No, I did not.  Did you just have to take a pause before you answered that question because you were taking  a swig of beer?  So you had a giant mouthful of beer.  Yes, I was.  All right.  Now, no, I never saw Rock of Ages.  Did you ever see Stomp?  I never saw Kinky Boots.  Stop.  I never saw Kinky Boots. 
[02:46:30]  No.  Stop.  It's very simple.  That was fun for five minutes.  I saw that.  Oh, did you?  After the first number, you're like, who gives a fuck?  Oh, they're just stomping.  Right.  I'm not into Broadway shows.  You ever seen Avenue Q?  Avenue Q.  All right.  Why don't you go into movies?  Maybe I saw some movies.  Who cares?  We like Broadway on this show.  Yeah, we're all about Broadway.  I know you do.  We love the theater.  I know you do. 
[02:47:00]  What was her thing with movies again?  Ask me the movies that I saw.  No.  Go back to the 70s and ask me what kind of movies I saw.  All right.  What kind of movies did you see in the 70s?  I saw Jaws.  Right?  Okay.  In the movies.  Wait, wait, Di.  Did you only watch movies in the 70s because you spent all the weekends in the 80s getting  anal sex?  Oh, that's true.  Wait a minute, Sam.  Remember there's no time for movies?  Hey, um.  No.  No.  Sam, in the 80s, I did see a couple of movies. 
[02:47:30]  Lady Di.  Can you tell me about, tell me about Jaws because I never saw Jaws.  Oh, yes, you did.  I swear.  No, I've never seen it.  Please tell me.  Give me the synopsis of the movie.  Can you tell me about Jaws?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was about a big shark.  Okay.  It was going after everybody.  You know, what else would you like?  It was a really bloody movie.  And what happened, though?  What happened?  He killed people.  The shark killed people.  Why was the shark killing people? 
[02:48:00]  Everybody saw Jaws.  Why did the shark kill people?  Because he was hungry.  He wanted something to eat.  Oh.  It's like a four-year-old synopsis.  It really is a four-year-old synopsis.  Is the shark hungry?  Of a movie.  Killing people because it's hungry.  Kill people because it's hungry.  How did it end?  He was mad.  How did it end?  They killed the shark.  Why?  Now that I gave it away to somebody that probably never saw it.  But I didn't see it. 
[02:48:30]  When Robert Shaw shoved that air tank into that shark's mouth, did you think there, but for  the grace of God, go I?  Because you're a monster.  I believe that was Jaws 2.  What?  That wasn't the first one.  Oh, really?  How did he die in the first one?  Oh, boy.  Let me think.  Oh, man.  And if he died in the first one, how did they make a second one?  He was very confusing.  I was carrying a piano up the steps.  I hit the blowers right away.  There was another shark in the second one. 
[02:49:00]  What do you mean there was another shark?  That's stupid.  Yeah.  I forgot.  Are you sure you're not confusing Jaws with breaking?  You electric boogaloo.  Oh, boy.  I forgot.  Yeah, of course you did.  It's called alcohol dementia.  Sam was asking me about back in the 80s.  Right.  Back in the 80s, I saw Friday the 13th.  All three of them.  You should have started next time.  There were eight Friday the 13th.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:49:30]  Exactly.  Jason X.  And Jason X.  Just you with a hockey mask to make you more fuckable?  Right.  Probably.  Who knows?  Wow.  Jimmy.  Jim and I, the old back and forth.  The old chemistry is right on.  Touche.  A little give and take going on.  I'm forgetting.  I'm forgetting.  What?  In the late 70s, I saw Saturday Night Fever, Grease, and Urban Cowboy.  What gives a fuck? 
[02:50:00]  Grease trouble.  This is not a real question.  No one cares who you saw.  And exactly in that order.  Exactly in that order, too.  You saw Grease on Broadway?  Oh, that was a Broadway show.  Oh, I wish I did.  Damn, you saw Grease on Broadway.  That's cool.  That is pretty fucking cool.  Who was playing Rizzo?  No, I did not see Grease on Broadway.  That's pretty cool.  I saw it in the movies.  You know, John Travolta.  I was a stink lady.  All right, can we leave now?  All right, please.  We got to go. 
[02:50:30]  All right.  Okay.  I love you guys.  Okay?  You're going to wait a long time for the rebuttal on that one.  I love you, too.  Oh, wow.  Oh, thank you, Jimmy.  Hold on a minute.  Hey, listen, listen.  Hold on a minute.  Dan in Pennsylvania.  Go ahead, Dan.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  You know, I called in a little while ago, and I honestly, after 10 minutes of listening 
[02:51:00]  to this fucking rhinoceros, I have no idea what I called about.  I don't even remember what my fucking name is.  All right.  Sorry about that.  She will make you just drift off.  Yeah.  Thank you, Lady Di.  You were wonderful, like always.  Okay.  You're welcome.  Okay?  Okay.  Did you see Caddyshack?  I just need to know from the 70s.  Late 70s.  I know it's the late 70s.  That one was 80.  81.  Was it 80?  Yeah.  I feel like it was 79. 
[02:51:30]  No.  I felt like it was 79.  1980?  Hold on.  No.  The Caddyshack?  79 was, I think, maybe Airplane.  All right.  Animal House was 77.  Now you've been here.  Blues Brothers.  Blues Brothers, 70s or 80s?  What?  Right around that time, right?  Yeah.  Yes, it was.  What about Chitty Chitty Bang Bang?  That was a good one.  Bedknobs and Broomsticks, Doc?  You've seen Bedknobs and Broomsticks?  No, but she's splatting over them.  I was a little girl when I was. 
[02:52:00]  Feeting by them.  My first movie was Dr. Doolittle.  Whoa.  Exactly.  She was Dr. Do-nothing.  She was Dr. Do-little.  Right, exactly.  Yeah, really.  Boy, if that didn't set your whole life up.  Yeah, exactly.  Did I ever see Oliver and Company?  Dr. Doolittle.  Why was that your first movie, Lady Di?  That was my first movie.  My father took me, and I was a little girl.  I believe I was maybe about five years old or six or something.  Dr. Doolittle.  Who was in that?  Anthony Newley? 
[02:52:30]  Wow, how do you know that?  Rex Harrison.  Rex Harrison and Anthony Newley.  Was Niven in that?  Rex Harrison was able to speak with things like you, right?  Animal.  Yeah, things like me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yes.  No, but anyway, so that was my very first movie.  All right.  That's a good first movie, I've got to tell you.  As far as first movies go.  My dad took me.  My dad took me to some of these films.  My dad even took me to Magical Way. 
[02:53:00]  Hold on.  No, please.  Don't do anything like that.  Oh, please.  Right.  My dad.  My dad.  Shut up and let me laugh.  At least let us laugh.  Deep Throat.  My dad took me to see Magical Mystery Tour,  because he knew I was a Beatles fan.  All right.  And he took me to the midnight showing of Magical Mystery Tour.  Oh, wow.  He really did not have to do that, but he did it. 
[02:53:30]  All these movies.  He then ran out and drove fast away from the theater.  Exactly.  Always found a way home.  And you had to act like fucking John Voight in the movie theater to get your cab fare home.  And that was the first and last time I ever saw that movie.  Were you like a Rocky Horror Picture Show type of broad?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You are?  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  That's good to know.  I saw that one, too.  Could you say, it's astounding, and then dance off a subway platform? 
[02:54:00]  I wasn't part of the show, okay?  No.  Oh, you weren't.  Well, but you're supposed to interact with that movie.  You ever interact with that movie, you and Marion, maybe?  Yeah.  Well, no, no, no.  Midnight Showings, a Rocky Horror Picture Show?  No.  I could see you there.  No.  It was not.  Some rice in your hand or something?  Throwing the rice around?  I had a date go with me, and my brother went with me.  Did you get any action?  One person.  And, oh, let me see.  We were doing the time warp together. 
[02:54:30]  You know, the time warp, that song.  Yeah.  It was a lot of fun, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  So, let me see.  Oh, God, I could go on and on.  Have you seen the musical Hair?  Oh, that one we missed.  Hair.  You seen Hair?  You must have saw Hair.  Old Calcutta.  Old Calcutta.  Did you see Hair?  No.  Did you see the movie Hair?  No.  No, I did not.  Wow.  It's a statement on the war.  Yeah.  I saw the movie Hair. 
[02:55:00]  Okay, but I didn't leave.  It's a musical.  It's a play.  That's what I was asking.  Right.  I saw the movie.  I saw the movie.  The movie.  They made it into a movie.  Yes, they did.  Fuck.  Who started it?  I didn't know that.  No, no, no.  I'm not in a way.  Probably D'Angelo.  Oh, really?  No, hold on, hold on.  Street Williams?  Really?  Aren't you thinking of European Vacation?  Wait, hold on.  No, I did.  No.  She was in Echo.  No, I saw those movies.  You did?  I did.  Okay.  I saw those, you know, like the vacation movies. 
[02:55:30]  Sure, sure.  Hey, Di, good talk, Russ.  What?  Yeah.  I saw, you know, whatever movies you mentioned, you know, the late 70s, early 80s.  Right.  You know, I used to go to the movies a lot.  Man.  Airplane?  I went to the movies a lot.  I don't think you had a lot of time in the 80s to go to movies with all that ass fucking  you had to deal with.  Well.  Every weekend. 
[02:56:00]  Remember every weekend you were taking it in the ass after you lost your virginity on  that door?  In the abandoned building?  Yeah.  You told us this.  We're not making it up.  How many times do you think you've been fucked in the ass?  Good question.  Not too many times, I'll tell you that.  You said it was for all of the 80s.  Every weekend during the 80s.  Every weekend in the 80s.  Every weekend in the 80s, but I did not enjoy it.  How many times do you get duked, Lady Di?  Oh, the reaming.  How many times do you get duked? 
[02:56:30]  Oh, boy.  All of our logs of shit look like the top of a nail.  Oh, will you stop already with that, Jimmy?  You don't even know what that means.  I don't care.  I don't want to hear it anymore.  Yeah, that's a good question.  You ever do ass to mouth?  What?  Ass to mouth?  ATM?  He never pulled his dick out and then shoved it in your mouth.  I wonder which would make the dick dirty.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  No way.  Not on my best day, I wouldn't do that.  Has Bill ever done ass to mouth? 
[02:57:00]  No.  She wouldn't do that on her best day.  On her best day.  What would you do on your worst day?  On my best day.  I can tell you what we do on our worst day.  And take this call.  Oh, but go ahead.  Go ahead.  Tell me what you do on your worst day.  Oh, my God.  Go back.  I got to talk to Tommy.  Is it all right if I talk to Tommy now?  Can we let you go?  Sure.  Go ahead.  No, we're going to let you go.  Oh, you are?  Okay.  Well, I think we covered Broadway today and movies that came out in the 70s, so I think 
[02:57:30]  we're doing pretty good.  Well, don't forget.  Don't forget.  What?  All right?  The thing with Colin Quinn and I.  Oh, God.  Right.  Didn't anybody do a duet with Stinky one time?  I don't know.  Remember that part back?  I thought she means her and her pussy signing together.  Oh, no.  Oh, sorry.  That was rancid.  Dylan.  Sure I did.  You just don't remember.  She's terrible.  Exactly.  We got to go.  Are you mad that fucking Theon Greyjoy got named after your vagina in Game of Thrones? 
[02:58:00]  Get it?  What?  Reek.  Is your vagina reek?  I don't know.  Oh, the vagina monologue, Sam.  Oh, my God.  Yes, the vagina monologue.  You must have saw that one.  Cries of Fear.  Right.  Cougar the Musical.  Oh, my God.  I'm telling you, the only two Broadway shows I saw were the ones I mentioned.  Hair.  Hair and...  My big fat Italian wedding.  Taboo and moving out.  My big fat Greek wedding.  Oh, did you do any of those wedding ones? 
[02:58:30]  Yeah, where you're kind of part of the wedding that's going down, Tina and Tommy's wedding  or whatever the fuck it's called.  How about The Wedding Singer?  What am I missing out on over here?  I didn't...  The Wedding Singer?  You're missing out on a lot of good Broadway.  The Wedding Singer, right.  The Wedding Singer, right.  The Wedding Singer.  Wedding Singer.  Yeah, what about The Wedding Singer with Stephen Lynch?  No, I saw The Wedding Singer, the movie.  I like The Wedding Singer.  With Adam Sadler, that one.  What movie?  Yeah.  What movie?  The Wedding Singer.  I just said that.  The play? 
[02:59:00]  No, the movie.  The Wedding Singer.  Yeah.  I feel like I'm in a coma.  Yeah.  I'm much like the audience.  You know what, though?  I like certain movies.  This was supposed to happen today.  I didn't see it in the movies.  I saw it on a lot.  All the shit that went on with the studio fucked everyone.  I know.  This is our punishment.  I don't like a whole lot of movies because I like to usually read the book.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, some of these movies, they replay them on television.  Yes, they do, but they're filled with commercials and advertisers for products that you don't care about. 
[02:59:30]  You read any good books lately, Di?  I haven't either.  No, wait a minute.  Oh, books.  I forgot one.  I forgot one.  What?  No, I forgot two, actually.  I saw Titanic in the movies.  Oh, God.  And I saw Mrs. Doubtfire in the movies.  And Mrs. Doubtfire.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  And I saw a lawful entry. </pre>
