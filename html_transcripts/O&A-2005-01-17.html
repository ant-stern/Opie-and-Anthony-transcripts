<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a raucous discussion of the Patriots' Super Bowl victory, focusing on Tom Brady and Peyton Manning, peppered with vulgar commentary and jokes about missed field goals and "choking."  The conversation veers into crude jokes about women and sex, and disparaging remarks about Pittsburgh.  A caller, Jerry from Jersey, graphically describes his experiences in Pittsburgh strip clubs, prompting further offensive discussion of strip clubs in other cities from the hosts.  Emails are read from Bernie Getz, a self-proclaimed subway vigilante, correcting a previous statement about squirrel behavior.  A call from Marion ensues, detailing a scandalous event involving the death of Lady Di’s son’s father (allegedly suicide by train),  leading to a chaotic, obscene, and often contradictory conversation with the hosts' relentless questioning and mocking. Martini Steve, with his newly bleached blonde hair, makes brief appearances, contributing to the chaotic energy.  The segment features sound effects, remixed audio clips (available on the website), commercial breaks, and radio station announcements.

The show continues with jokes about Steve's blonde hair, its perceived "gayness," and comparisons to unusual tattoos.  The "Hi, Mom, I'm Gay" prank call segment follows, before a commercial break for XM Radio. Post-break, the hosts make jokes about Martin Luther King Jr. Day and its lack of diversity on their show, venturing into potentially offensive speculation about Dr. King's personal life.  Jim Norton joins the studio, recounting his Chicago stand-up gigs, contrasting positive experiences at Zaney's (due to their unique check-delivery policy) with negative experiences at other clubs.  He discusses his upcoming Tonight Show appearance and frustrations with a New York comedy club.  Norton delivers a scathing, highly offensive review of *The Village*, criticizing its acting, plot, and twist ending,  engaging with callers who either agree or defend the movie. The segment ends with a short music break.

The next segment involves a comedic deconstruction of a Cindy Adams New York Post column predicting 2005. The hosts read and mock Adams's jokes, offering their own offensive "improvements."  Celebrities like Anna Nicole Smith, Osama Bin Laden, Paris Hilton, Bill Maher, the Olsen twins, Condoleezza Rice, Mini-Me, Queen Elizabeth, Robert Blake, Amber Frey, and Donald Trump are all mocked. A listener calls in with their opinion on a movie scene.  Audio clips from the Golden Globe Awards are played, focusing on Star Jones's appearance, which the hosts criticize using derogatory language.  A listener calls in, and there’s further discussion of NFL games and the Today Show’s MLK Day segment featuring Al Roker.

A significant portion of the following segment focuses on audio from a Golden Globes red carpet interview with Joan and Melissa Rivers, with the hosts criticizing Melissa’s apparent intoxication using vulgar language.  Sports topics, including Bill Belichick and Super Bowl predictions, are interspersed with raunchy jokes and offensive comments. A caller makes a sexually suggestive comment to one of the hosts.  Brian Kilmeade from Fox & Friends joins, promoting his book, discussing the Iraq War, the political climate, and sharing anecdotes about Fox News and past altercations, including a minor car accident.  They also discuss a rumored Pentagon "gay bomb" project. The segment ends with further Golden Globes discussion and XM Radio promotions.

The final segment features Brian Kilmeade further promoting his book, "The Games Do Count," and discussing profiles of individuals from diverse fields who played sports.  The hosts discuss their own high school sports experiences and changing attitudes towards competition.  A large portion is dedicated to a humorous retrospective of their firing and rehiring after the "Sex for Sam" incident in St. Patrick's Cathedral, focusing on the actions of "Psycho Mark" and his later employment at Fox News.  Callers phone in with bizarre "bombs" from news reports.  The segment includes commercial breaks for Better Sex Kits and XM Satellite Radio.

[00:08:30]  yeah they kick some ass  you know they get their hair done  because they're convinced  that Brady actually  might notice them  or maybe is even looking  at them through the TV  oh of course  some of these broads  in Massachusetts  oh Peyton Manning  go home  bye bye  I love the look  that all these players  put on from the losing team  when they're having  a press conference  they just put their head down  kind of look  shake their head a little  put on that  mouth 
[00:09:00]  well you know  next time  oof  the fact is  Brady and  well the whole team  I mean  there was a team effort  they just kicked  the Colts ass  yeah  I mean what  they had the ball  for a whole quarter  what  oh I know  what was that  the third quarter  they had one drive  the whole quarter  yeah the drives  are hysterical  they just eat up the clock  they know they're scoring  at the end of it  unbelievable  and what a great game  to watch  you know there's  something to be said  about when it's snowing 
[00:09:30]  and they're lining up  and you just see  that steam coming  out of the nose  it's like animals  out there  you know eventually  the NFL is going  to wreck that  you think they'll  eventually this game  is going to be played  in all domed stadiums  all over the country  they'll like cover the field  and call it a delay  if it snows  eventually they're going  to take the weather  right out of the game  it's all going to be  in domes  you watch  I kind of like that  when it's snowing  like crazy  yeah  definitely  great games to watch  well you know  I keep talking about 
[00:10:00]  the pass  pass pass  because I'm trying  to avoid  distract yourself  from the heart  I'm trying to avoid  the inevitable there  oh J  E  T  S  Jets  Jets  Jets  what are you trying  to avoid  the fact that  Heather Mills  is now kicking  for the Jets  oh man  what a mess  the best team  in football  we had it  we had it  dude  it was there  do we have  the missed field goals  we're looking for those 
[00:10:30]  that should have just been  and the Jets do it  and a tremendous upset  the Jets  it should have  that's how it should have been  they outplayed them  you know  the second half  of that game  and  and  I don't know  I blame  I blame the coach  you blame the coach  I blame  Herm Edwards  I think you gotta  continue being aggressive  and you can't  just rely on  I hate  relying on these  kickers  there's too much  pressure for one guy  plus he's gotta  kick the winning 
[00:11:00]  field goal  in Pittsburgh  in front of a hometown  crown like that  no no  you figure the averages  these guys connect  a lot of the times  man  yeah but what happened  was he missed  the first one  yeah  what a ridiculous  way to miss it  hit the bar  both bars  right on the corner  like that  right on the corner  so then you know  the second try at it  he's gonna over kick it  because he's like  wasn't it about  the same distance  a few yards shorter  right  yeah it was a couple  yards shorter  but I think he was  thinking you know  I really gotta boot  this thing now 
[00:11:30]  I did it the first time  came up short  I really gotta boot  this  I gotta get a little  effort  and when you give  something a little  more effort  in sports  what do you do  that's what happens  when you're golfing  and you go  I'm gonna crush this  yeah you're swinging  a little too hard  it's kinda like  where does it go  I assume it's kinda  like kicking a field  goal  what a disaster  the fact that it's  in Pittsburgh  doesn't mean anything  the only thing  it's hard to do  in Pittsburgh  is find a chick  under 250 pounds  stupid awful  steel mill dump  with snow in July  Pittsburgh sucks  they don't deserve  a Super Bowl  and they don't deserve 
[00:12:00]  to feel good  about anything  I hear Pittsburgh's  not a bad city  yeah if you're  a bad mustache  or an incest survivor  if you're anything else  it's an awful city  ah Belichick  alright Ben  you got the best  coach in the league  relax  that damn team  man  I just hate  the fact that  the Sox and the Pats  are like  that whole thing  going on up there  god they're just  gonna be crowing  about this  for years  well  we have a very tough  game this week  so  this game  this game 
[00:12:30]  against Steelers  is gonna be a great game  it's not gonna be a  Jets  it's not gonna be a tough game  the Jets  that's repeatable  the Jets  well you know  look at Ben  well now  calm down  he knows they're gonna win  but he's just  I don't wanna jinx it  calm down  you know the confidence  everyone said  wait a second  you're acting just like  any Pats player  they all  you know  low key  that phony humility  all week  down play  like  we have a tough game  and after it's all  I knew the whole time  those jerks  and you know 
[00:13:00]  they printed up  the Colts  you know  you know  champions  AFC champion  t-shirts  and all that stuff  and nobody  talked about Brady  all week  and look at the game  and Manning  they got three points  three points  he really does choke  every time they need him  to come up big  him and his  down syndrome haircut  just fall on their  stupid faces  that's right  he choked last year too  you're right  yeah  he can never beat the Pats  so then  you know  congrats to the Eagles  Eagles look good  oh yeah  kicking Minnesota's ass  another choke team 
[00:13:30]  Minnesota  every year  they start off great  you know  they're 9-1  and they just go  face first into the bowl  and ruin their  awful Midwestern fans  hopes  they do it every year  they stink  at the end of the year  where's the post from today  I gotta  right here  post coming up  continue with that  did you see the play  where they tried to fake  they were doing a field goal  and they tried to fake it  and Randy Moss  didn't know what was going on  what a disaster he was  he didn't know what was going on  he was running off the field  they do this play 
[00:14:00]  where you know  you look like you're walking off the field  and they snap the ball  when he's by the sideline  and then throw it to him  there's a lot of trickery going on  in football these days  a lot of trickery  I think they tried one in the Pats game  last night  didn't they  they tried  was it that or was it the  the Philly game  there was another little trickery  that didn't quite pan out  well the Vikings one was the worst  yeah that was the worst  because then  he just walks off the field  he's supposed to stay on  and then he's just sitting there  with his hair up  like ugh  yeah what a disaster 
[00:14:30]  how about catching the ball  and holding on to the god damn thing  is the Daily News in here  because I want to bring up something about  why you need like 40 or 50 pages of ads  we're happy to get that for you  where's the Daily News  I call it the Daily Snooze  oh cut it out  you know so many ads  and then finally the game  the game that no one cares about  yeah  Atlanta  yeah who cares  Atlanta St. Louis  except for the people that live in those cities I guess  it's not  I don't know what it is about  like Atlanta and St. Louis  yeah  there's not many people that root for those teams 
[00:15:00]  unless you're from there  no they're not those big name teams  at least you can get into watching the Eagles  you know what I mean  uh huh  they're kind of close  they're  thank you  I like how Patriots have to spread it all over a region  New England  that's kind of vague isn't it  we're the north of Connecticut Patriots  yeah  creeps  yeah what the hell is that  why weren't they the Massachusetts Patriots  or the Boston Patriots  we gotta include everyone  we gotta  Vermont  yeah  we wanna include Vermont and Maine  and  this whole region  any faggots that make ice cream 
[00:15:30]  you can enjoy the Patriots  you know  you know  whether you're a racist  or you're tapping a tree for syrup  this is your team  it is that diverse too  yeah  it goes all the way from like Rhode Island  up into  way up into Vermont  you're right  like Canada  I think even  I think even the people of Maine  follow the past  they do  you're so right  uh maybe it's in Newsday  I'm trying to find this one thing 
[00:16:00]  whatever you're looking for  there's a bunch of um  examples of uh  people choking in sports  oh yeah yeah yeah  and there was a really  there was one that Jimmy  uh remembers obviously  it's probably my worst  single sports moment  I've had some  some more bigger heartbreaks  yeah  but I think that's the worst moment  it uh  it has happened  many many times  with a choke  alright  it's not in there either  wow  I don't know  whatever  you sure sat in the uh  hello  you looked at all the papers  I know  uh  let's say hi to Jerry in uh  Jersey  Jerry what's up  you didn't hit the other button 
[00:16:30]  oh the button's Opie  the buttons  hold  hold on Jerry  no it didn't click  Jerry  it didn't click  alright there we go  Jerry what's up buddy  Jerry  I want to tell Norton  that it's not too bad  in Pittsburgh  I was at the game  on Saturday  and afterward we went  to the strip clubs  and stuff  and uh  the girls over there  they danced  at the strip bars  without clothes  and then you can pay  them for sex  afterward  I paid $125  for an hour  and I had sex  with her for like  you know 10 minutes  $125 for an hour 
[00:17:00]  that's fantastic  wow  nice girls  who was it  Mabel King  how'd you pull that off  we found a limo driver  we didn't know  our way around  so we paid a limo driver  the driver's around  $40  he took us all over the city  and then picked us up  he took us to a nice  strip club out there  next to the hotel  by the airport  and uh  the girls over there  are pretty as hell  and they're actually  better than over here  because  the hotel by the airport  has hot girls  right in your face  without any uh  underwear or bras  or anything  they're freaky over there 
[00:17:30]  well I'll actually be out  at the Pittsburgh Improv  at the end of the month  so I'll have the limo driver  taping all the hot spots  like where Cordell Stewart  bought his knee pads  I'd love to find out  where that is  the strip bar's by the  uh  the Sheridan Hotel  by the airport  it's all right over there  okay thank you  I'll make sure I check it out  at the end of the month  I'll be there  all right  there you go  he did a great job  of dispelling uh  any rumors about  Pittsburgh  yeah you want to meet  the hot chicks  hang out by the airport  Terminal 5  strippers that uh  also hook  that's great for a neighborhood 
[00:18:00]  I like the fact that  he said they take  they dance without their clothes  as opposed to  how do most strippers dance  yeah  fully clothed  yeah  oh the hot one  in the parka  I like her  although we did go to  a strip club  where they were in bikinis  what was that Philly  oh yeah yeah  that was uh  cheerleaders  something like that  where they don't even  take their tops off  or anything  was that  Boston was the one  we went to  where they give you  the area dance  where they're like  you're sitting there  on a couch  and they're about  two feet away from you  yeah  it's awful  Ben can actually walk 
[00:18:30]  through herking and jerking  and not touch either one  never hit a girl  or you  and it's called  the area dance  it's a ridiculous  Massachusetts law  they can't come  it's like two feet away  from you  I think it's 18 inches  is that what it is  however long your arm is  when you're leaning to the left  to shoot your pregnant wife  that's about the distance  oh god  and that was good improv  on my part  you're leaning to your left  like they're driving in England  nice thinking stupid  it's leaning to the right  didn't you just make  a Charles Stewart reference  yeah  wow  very nice 
[00:19:00]  good old Chuck  good old Chuck  but that was enraging  when I saw that they would do it  I mean I understand  that you can only have  so much  you know  contact  I want to wish  Chuck Stewart  a very very happy  Martin Luther King Day  yes  oh  very good  not too inappropriate  we should dedicate  this show  to all the white guys  that blamed it  on the black guy  yeah right  Susan Smith  Susan Smith  oh yeah  congratulations  alright  you've done that  Jeremy what's up  Fred Goldman 
[00:19:30]  hey guys  I lived in Pittsburgh  for about three years  I was going to school there  I could not have  hightailed it out of that city  faster  that's it  I'm not  you had a call up  to tell us that  well no  the guy was defending  Pittsburgh at first  when I called him  did he hear how he  defended it though  horribly  I heard at the end  even at the airport  the girls are gutter trash  dude if you want to know  about Pittsburgh  Christopher Walken  shot himself in the head  so he wouldn't have  to go back  alright guys 
[00:20:00]  have a good day  alright bye  so anyway  biggest chokes  in sports history  I can't find  the damn thing  but you know  they mentioned  Scott Norwood's  missed field goal  that was huge  and they mentioned  obviously the dude  on the Jets  I don't even know  his name  I don't even care  Brian  yeah whatever  Jackie Smith  it doesn't matter  why even remember  his name  he's not even  going to be  playing football  next year  who the hell  is going to have him  on their team  next year  Brian  your whole job  is to just sit there  on the sidelines  and wait to kick the ball 
[00:20:30]  that's all  in between  you warm up  you kick into that  little net  for a while  on the side  and then when your  big time comes up  you get up  and you put it  between the uprights  I blame the fact  that he was using  that tripod thing  oh yeah okay  that tripod thing  what's that  they take the human  contact out of it  when they're practicing  on the sidelines  it's like this tripod  thing that holds  the football up  like it's a finger  and the guy is just  all alone by himself  on the sidelines  kicking practice  practice  they used to have 
[00:21:00]  guys there  that were snapping  and then the other  team there was  you know  they had the other  guy holding the ball  and I'm thinking  the guy's holding  the ball  he's practicing  his field goals  on the sideline  giving him a little  encouragement  like okay  hang in there  alright we might  need you today  blah blah blah  hey I'm noticing  maybe you're  hooking it a little  bit  right and there's  yeah exactly  you might have  said hey dude  yeah  you know  something maybe  you're not noticing  and there's  what's his name  from the Jets  on the sideline  by himself  just kind of  maybe they'll  put me in  yeah just kind of 
[00:21:30]  setting the ball  up on his  little tripod  by himself  and kicking the ball  as a kicker  you gotta be like  oh please  blow these guys out  yeah yeah yeah  I do not want  to be the guy  today  please  how about  who was it  that blew it  from Minnesota  a couple years ago  he hadn't missed  all year  and he missed  the game winning  field goal  because when it  comes down to  like when these  games get more  and more important  the pressure is  way too much  Gary Anderson  Gary Anderson  that's right  wow that's right  good call  what was that  three overtimes  in a row  for the Jets  was it 
[00:22:00]  that's ridiculous  they put themselves  in that position  I don't know  they start playing  conservative at the  end of the game  for some reason  instead of going  for the win  yeah it's like  oh we'll just  try to hold it  right here  at a tie  and we'll go  into overtime  yeah well  we'll just worry  about getting  you know  the ball  you know  in the middle  of the field  to give them  a nice angle  there  they try to  eat the clock  by just running  it running  it running  instead of  throwing screens  or passing  or doing anything  it's really irritating  all teams do that  it stinks  alright and then  what's his name 
[00:22:30]  for the Cowboys  with that choke  oh Jackie Smith  Jackie Smith  yeah Roger Staubach  they mentioned that  in the paper  today too  what he comes out  of retirement  or something like that  I don't know  I think  I was 13  when that happened  I think it was  Super Bowl 13  Eric can you find that  it's in one of the papers  it's in the sports section  it's one of the  it's a whole section of  I looked through these papers  I love how we are  on a sports show here  we bring up things  and know nothing about them  we really  who was that guy  and it's like my team  and I'm like  well I was 13 
[00:23:00]  no wait I was 11  but this is  dude  but this is how regular guys  talk about sports  when you start talking  when you start listening  to those sports talk shows  they speak way over your head  I like the ones  with all the  oh Doug Bryan  that's his name right  no not Doug  I had no idea who it was  it's Bryan or Breen  I don't know  we know nothing right  we know nothing  this is great  this is like real guy  sports talk  who was that guy  that dropped the ball  during the Super Bowl 13  Roger Staubach  threw it  the guy was wide open 
[00:23:30]  in the end zone  he came out of retirement  that year  and he dropped it  and then they lost  the Super Bowl  to whoever  35-31 I think  35-31 to Pittsburgh  yeah believe me  remember the score  and nothing else  I do remember the score  yeah and Randy White  was playing with a cast  on his arm  that was a great Super Bowl  man  it was a great one  except for the obvious  Dallas was getting killed  and they came back  yeah  let's go to Adam  in the Bronx  hey Adam  good morning fellas  hi Adam  good morning Shmoopy  hi sweetie  we are forgetting  about the most important  screw up in football history 
[00:24:00]  go ahead  Ray Finkel  from East Ventura  which one  was that when he ran  the wrong way  no  Lace is out  Lace is out dude  from East Ventura  oh  come on Jim  I don't remember  that's not my favorite  all time comedy  no  mine either  but it was a good  a good scene  if you did a moment  from used cars  I would have gotten it  that's a fine comedy  or the village  oh the village  that was  get them started again  we'll talk about it  a little bit later  but that's a hot film 
[00:24:30]  right Jim  from the Poconos  Jim what's up  what's up guys  are you kidding me  they were getting  conservative at the end  of the first half  oh I know  I know  but even more  it has to get fired today  even more conservative  at the end of the game  but you're right  they just play  a very conservative game  yeah  Hackett has to go  today  you should have been  fired yesterday  not today  but yesterday  and in all reality  you should have been  fired in the second half  on us  in the second half  talk to you later guys 
[00:25:00]  alright  I will say this though  the Jets were in  position to beat  I think what is  the best team in  football right now  or the second best  team in football  and the kicker blew it  their coaches had  them in a position  to move on  and to win  and he blew it  and I feel like  maybe we could be  like Mike and the  Mad Dog  that was fat boar  I watched his TV show  I hope he slips  and cracks his fat face  on a banister  stupid know-it-all  Mad Dog  Mad Dog  hey Brett  what's up  a lot of pressure  on him there Mikey  a lot of pressure 
[00:25:30]  on the kicker  Maggie  I just gotta say  where the fuck  is Bernie Getz  to celebrate  Martin Luther King's Day  aww  well  it's funny  you should mention  Bernie Getz  as you know  Ben's his pen pal  he sends emails  to Ben all the time  Bernie Getz of course  the subway vigilante  from 1984  five utes  came up to him  on a subway  was it five?  four  four  I'm sorry  four  came up to him  on a subway  asked for five bucks  and then Bernie decided  that was a little too much 
[00:26:00]  for him to handle  so he decided  to shoot all four of them  felt a little threatened  so uh  yeah  we've had him on the show  a couple times  and he loves Ben  he wants Ben  to come over  smoke pot  and hang out  in his apartment  who doesn't  and we're gonna  take him up on that  actually  we're gonna go over  to Bernie Getz's  apartment eventually  but we gotta go  like with a group  of us or something  cause you know  he has firearms  in his apartment  you think?  oh come on  he only likes Ben  because Ben's  awful jerky movements  remind him of the  squirrel that ran away  just frightened  and unpredictable  twitching tale 
[00:26:30]  he talks about  the squirrel  in these two emails  and it just shows you  that this guy  I mean we all know  he's nuts  but he is nuts  he thinks about  every word he says  okay  which one goes first Ben?  oh okay  this one  okay  so it's from  he has the best  AOL freaking name  I wish I could say it  but then we're gonna  ruin this  we didn't say it  it's on his website  oh it is?  so everyone knows  his email address  is Bernie Pie  Bernie Pie  hey Bernie Pie  hey Bernie  hey Bernie Pie 
[00:27:00]  subject  Opie and Anthony  I made a mistake  on the show  he is so obsessed  with every word  he says  so he writes  ah  gets me every time  that's not even fake  I made a mistake  on the show  I said when squirrels  growl  it means go away  which is incorrect  I should have said  it means that  they don't like it  I'll try to correct  this another time  that's all he writes  I'll try to correct this 
[00:27:30]  he didn't want to put out  any erroneous information  on the airwaves  so he writes that  on Friday  and that wasn't good enough  so he writes Ben again  Saturday  and it says  subject  squirrel  growl  clarification  he's gotta be joking  no he's not  we saw him  he's a freak  I know  he has to have  everything lined up  when he's in here  you want to think  he's joking  someone can't be  thinking like this  and then he writes  my squirrel sometimes  growls  if I close the window 
[00:28:00]  he likes it open  that's it  that's it  that's what makes  the whole email  that's what makes  it really creepy  that he felt like  he needed to  to say that to Ben  so the first one is  I said when squirrels  growl  it means go away  which is incorrect  I should have said  it means that  they don't like it  they don't like it  I'll try to correct  this another time  and then the second  email a day later  my squirrel sometimes  growls if I close  the window  he likes it open  he probably closed 
[00:28:30]  the window  the squirrel made  a little sound  and he went  ooh  let me run to the  computer and email  Ben  I gotta clarify  what a nut  let's go to Tim  hey Tim  real fast  let's go  yeah  the question is  why do we care  about the Jets  their offense  only created  three points  for the whole game  that's a great point  great point  hey so did the Colts  yeah but the Colts  were never really  in that game  yeah but if you've  got an offense  that can only  create three points 
[00:29:00]  how bad  they're gonna  look next weekend  when they run up  against a team  yeah that's a good point  you're kinda right  the defense  you know  kept them in that game  obviously  Steelers were controlling  the Jets big time  a couple big plays  and the Jets  turned it around  you're right  well it was  their defense  it was their game  you know  so who the hell  wants to watch  a loser  alright  thank you Tim  let's go to  Jackie in Jersey  before we take  our first break  here  Jackie  hey there Obie  this is Christopher 
[00:29:30]  Mad Dog Russo  just so you know  maybe if we just  didn't have a  head coach  they'd be able  to win the game  if you feel  four more  you can take  the rest of the week  off  waddle doodle  wow  you know  this is a perfect  place to take  our first break  unfortunately  if he wants  to do an impression  he should do  an impression  of Paul the pilot  driving home  what the hell  was that  I don't know 
[00:30:00]  what that was  that was  Mad Dog Seinfeld  hey  let me tell you  something  what's with  these sports  players  and the peanuts  on their airplanes  who is that  fat pig  across from me  I don't do  impressions  that was awful  that was a pretty  good impression  though  I liked it  better than his  quick break  we'll talk about  the Golden Globes  or whatever  Golden Globes  it was the Golden  Globes  star studded  extravaganza  I like the 
[00:30:30]  format they use  on the Golden  Globes  it's not that  auditorium  seating  looking forward  kind of thing  it's tables  where they're  eating and  drinking  so as  somebody's up  on stage  talking  they'll pan  over to  some of these  tables  and these  very high  profile celebrities  are either  shoving something  in their face  or drinking  or leaning over  because they're  all their pals  around them  they get tables  for like  one movie  so there's  people that  have been  working together  and you can  see sometimes  you read  their lips 
[00:31:00]  and like  what the  is he  talking  about  you know  and they're  actually  commenting  you can  read their  lips  or she  that dress  looks awful  on her  I saw  somebody say  that  really  yeah  it's a much  better format  than just  the big  auditorium  thing  where they  just all  sit there  and stare  straight ahead  yeah  and they get  hammered  they're sitting  there  you see  big bottles  of champagne  on their  tables  they come  up to give  the acceptance  speech  it's just  a rambling  babbling  drunken mess  it's like a lot  better than the  Oscars  well we got a lot  of audio from  the golden  globes  we'll talk  about that  and we got  lots to do

[00:34:30]  It's the XM Radio Ski and Snowboard Report.  I'm John Lewis.  This report brought to you by Smuggler's Notch, Vermont,  the number one family resort in North America.  Family funds guaranteed.  Smuggs.com.  Well, you've got a day off today.  Why not make fresh tracks at Monmouth, California, where they've seen over 30 feet.  So far this year, of course, they've got everything open on packed powder conditions.  Mount Batcher in Oregon, if it's a little busy, look for that rainbow chair  where locals know to go for some nice beginner cruisers.  Deer Valley and Park City, Utah, enjoying fresh powder in almost 100 trails right now, 
[00:35:00]  including their bowls.  At Jackson Hole, Wyoming, look for that half pipe on Aprevue.  At Breckenridge, Colorado, you'll find one on El Dorado.  Over to the East Coast now, where Sugar Mountain, North Carolina saw a few inches over the weekend.  Look for Switchback, a really nice intermediate trail.  They've got about half their stuff open right now.  Seven Springs PA skiing their front face in Vermont, Killington, and Okemo.  Almost 100 trails each.  And Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, a nice three-foot base.  I'm John Lewis with the XM Radio Ski and Snowboard. 
[00:35:30]  XM 2.0.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Neon lights, love and prize.  When a mirror speaks, the reflection lies.  You won't have to follow me.  Only you can set me free.  And we're back with the O.B. and Anthony program.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  I do believe that's a black artist. 
[00:36:00]  Are we going to have a theme today?  From Earl's Black Rock Coalition.  We're going to do Black Rejoiners all day long in honor of Martin Luther King Day.  There you go.  And I think we're the only ones working at XM today.  Really?  Is it a big holiday?  I'm sure some of the radio shows are on, but...  DC shuts down, right?  Of course.  They have to shut down.  You know where the headquarters are.  Of course.  Wonderful.  They're in the middle of Chocolate City.  It's Martin Luther King Day.  I mean, trust me. 
[00:36:30]  There's no one working today down there in Washington at the compound.  It's kind of an ironic way to honor a black guy, too.  Nobody works.  That was too easy, bro.  I have a mouthful of food, though.  What am I going to do?  So you decide to go for the quick, easy one.  Yeah, just bang it out there real quick.  All right, let's say hi to Marion.  One half of the...  Shut up!  How's everybody doing?  Everybody.  Everybody.  Let's get into it. 
[00:37:00]  Get stupid.  Get retarded.  Get retarded.  Get retarded.  Let's get retarded.  Let's get retarded in here.  Let's get retarded.  Let's get retarded in here.  Yes?  I was ready to give you the big intro, and you have to start babbling right away.  Guys, I was going to come up today to visit you.  Listen to her.  She doesn't listen to her.  She doesn't stop.  She doesn't shut up.  And she's the smarter one.  She's the smart one.  Thank you.  And she's still really stupid.  Hey, Opie.  This is one half of the retarded Laverne and Shirley. 
[00:37:30]  Hey, Opie, can you do me a favor?  What?  I don't care if you pick on Diane, but leave her kid out of it, please.  Why?  Does he listen?  He doesn't listen.  All right, fair game.  No, no, no, no.  Listen to me.  No, no.  You listen to me.  He doesn't want to go back to his mother.  Really?  Yes.  I talk to him once a week.  He's doing good.  Oh, he is?  He's happy where he is.  Listen, I'm good.  Listen, I never made fun of the kid.  I made fun of the fact that Lady Di's an unfit mother. 
[00:38:00]  I know that.  And that the kid's better off living somewhere else.  That's all I ever said.  He is better.  He is better where he is.  I've never personally made fun of the kid.  You know, believe it or not, I pretty much leave kids alone on this radio show.  I know, but see, he's happy where he is.  He's doing really good with her father.  He's going to school every day.  He's doing his homework.  He's in a better place, you're saying.  Yes.  Like with Joel Steinberg.  All right, Marion.  He really is.  He's doing good.  Marion, really fast, because I think Lady Di was lying to us. 
[00:38:30]  Did she ever have a roommate or a friend or an ex-boyfriend that died?  Nothing like that?  No, she, I'm going to tell you, Peter's father died.  Who's Peter?  Her son.  Her son's father died years ago, but they weren't together when he died.  Was it under any type of wacky circumstances?  No, they were not together.  But how did he die?  He, long story, but he got sick and died. 
[00:39:00]  Of what?  Of die.  No, he did.  He had a lot of problems, and he was in a lot of hospital.  He didn't, you know.  What exactly was it that got him?  What was he sick with?  I don't know.  Was it cancer?  They weren't together, so I don't know.  Go to Dr. Kennedy.  Tony.  I don't know.  He might have had a heart attack.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  But this is going back a long time ago.  Huh?  This is going back when the kid was a baby, so.  There's no one that may have been involved with a train? 
[00:39:30]  Uh, no.  Hmm.  All right, because this story gets more and more interesting, and that's the only reason  we have you on today, by the way.  No.  Uh, Stark and Patty, who has become friends with the retarded Laverne Shirley, wrote an  email to Ben, and she writes, if she's listening, maybe she could give us a quick call.  Hey there, I guess things got so busy on the show and stuff, I explained to Eric the Hawk  that I had to leave today as I was almost running late to work.  That's right.  She was here two days last week. 
[00:40:00]  Shut up.  She was here two days last week, and she couldn't get in the studio to give us gifts.  I have to try again next week on Thursday, because I'm off from work that day, and we'll  have no time.  Have no time.  Well, she was, that was Peter's father. 
[00:40:30]  She got pregnant by him and had her son.  Soon after, they'd broken up, and she never saw him again.  In October, around the last two weeks of, what?  In October, around the last two weeks of October 2001, to be exact, this guy committed suicide  by jumping in front of a train.  I don't know if he did that, but he did die.  The story was reported in the Star-Ledger.  Oh.  Which is a New Jersey newspaper.  He did die, though, but he was.  You say that again, I'm going to throw a CD at your fat face. 
[00:41:00]  I'm trying to tell you something, though.  He did, he took care of his kid until he died.  Right up until he threw himself in front of a train.  He did take care of his son.  I mean, they weren't together, but he did take care of Peter.  He'd rather kiss a train than the lady die.  But I'm just saying that, you know, do whatever you want to do with her, because right now,  me and her, we're not even talking right now.  I'm pissed off at her.  Why?  Why are you pissed off at her?  Because she's a fuck-up, okay?  And she's fucked up more than once or twice. 
[00:41:30]  And in five more months, she's going to be out on the friggin' street.  Five months, why?  Because city welfare don't last forever, and she thinks it lasts forever, but it doesn't.  Hmm.  All right.  You know, she's laughing and giggling.  Oh, oh, I got five more months.  Well, five more months, when welfare decides not to pay her rent, she's going to be living  in the fucking Westfield train station.  But she's, um, she's looking for a job, right?  She's looking, but she don't call the places back.  Of course she doesn't.  She's a lazy drunk.  You know, I mean, come on.  I've been, I've got a job. 
[00:42:00]  All right, it's the retard hour.  Stalker Patty.  I've got an application.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Oh, God.  Where are you?  Stalker Patty, go ahead.  Hi, Patty.  How you doing?  I'm fine.  I just went about calling Di on my own on Friday to ask her more about it, and that's  what she told me.  And the fact that it was possibly written up in the papers in the Star-Ledger, that it's a matter  of public records.  So maybe it did happen that way.  I don't know.  So that was probably something that, oh, my God, shut up, shut up.  I want to kill you. 
[00:42:30]  Shut up.  Shut up.  Listen, if people are talking, you shut up.  I forgot.  I forgot she's the one that can't shut up.  Oh, my God.  See, Lady Di and Marion have separate problems.  Marion is the one that just cannot shut her trap.  There's no way she can shut up when other people are talking.  I guarantee she will not shut up.  I'll be in there talking.  See?  Shut up.  Shut up.  I want to kill you.  Yeah, and now she's listening to me telling her to shut up.  Go ahead.  Turn that goddamn thing down.  Stop listening to yourself.  And turn down the radio.  Turn that wacky contraption down. 
[00:43:00]  Let me just go across the room and turn the radio down, okay?  Let me go across the room.  Oh, look at Patty living high on the hogs.  Yeah.  She used to not be able to cross the room she lived in, remember?  She used to live in a closet where she could touch both walls with her outstretched hands,  and now she has to walk across the room, Anthony.  She's doing well in life.  Of course.  Years ago, she would just stick out one awful leg, and a bunion would hit the button on the radio.  Now, oh, jeez, could you turn down that radio?  I'm happy for Patty. 
[00:43:30]  I'm happy for Patty.  All right.  Shut up.  It's not about Patty.  So go ahead, stalker Patty.  Well, anyway, I just took the liberty of asking about it, and that's what she told me.  Patty, when you called her, was she drunk or sober?  She was probably calling the show because the phone was busy at first, and about 5 after 10, it rang.  You know, she didn't sound drunk to me.  She called the show Friday drunk because I heard the replay when I got home from work.  Oh, yeah, all slurring and drunken. 
[00:44:00]  She wanted to let you know she did call you guys drunk in the morning.  Well, you know she calls drunk in the morning.  And we're not stupid.  She's a disaster.  All right.  This doesn't need to go on all morning long.  No, it doesn't.  So basically, Lady Di's kid doesn't want to live with her anymore.  No.  The kid's happy with Lady Di's father.  Lady Di had a...  Lady Di's father?  Is that who it is?  Yes, it's her father.  And Lady Di's...  Well, the guy that effed Lady Di to have this kid threw himself in front of a train, supposedly, 
[00:44:30]  back in 2001.  Right.  But they weren't together, so he was with somebody else.  So you know the guy jumped in front of a train, right?  He did die, yeah.  Yeah, but he was with somebody else.  Wait, wait.  Marion.  Marion.  You're being evasive here.  Do you know and did you know that this guy threw himself in front of a train?  Yes, I knew him.  Okay.  Wait, wait, wait.  I didn't ask if you knew him.  Don't even try him.  Die.  Marion.  Idiot.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  Yes, he did kill himself. 
[00:45:00]  Okay?  Right.  And you knew that?  Yes, he did.  And you were being evasive?  But let me tell you something.  It had nothing to do with Diana.  Why'd you lie, though, and say he was running out of the hospital?  It had nothing to do with Diana, though.  That's what it is.  I didn't let you know it had nothing to do with Diana.  But why did you lie and say that he had died in the hospital?  Because this is something that she doesn't want to talk about, okay?  She doesn't want to brought up.  Why?  Because it happened so many years ago, okay?  Yeah, but they weren't together anymore.  They weren't, but he was with a friend of ours.  Did he jump in front of the train, or did a man in, like, a top hat and a little thin 
[00:45:30]  mustache tie him to the tracks?  He had other problems, and he decided to end it all, okay?  Yeah.  But he was with somebody else?  He was with somebody else.  And did they both die at the same time?  No, no, no.  She's still alive.  It's a friend of ours.  She's still alive.  Wait, so she...  They had a suicide pact?  No, she's still alive.  But you said they were together.  Were they together on the tracks?  No, no, no.  And then she decided at the last second, screw this, and jumped out of the way?  They were living together, because Diane left Vinny, which his name was Vinny. 
[00:46:00]  Diane left him, and got him fixed up with an old friend of ours.  Nice.  Well, did he kill himself because he was depressed, or was he protesting some sort of a nuclear  shipment?  I'm not sure why.  I'm not sure why.  Yeah.  It just happened.  Wow.  And you lied to us, too.  Yeah.  Well, let me tell you.  We love liars on this show.  That's 15 years ago.  What?  That's 15 years ago.  That's something that said that should not be brought up.  I thought it was 2001.  It says...  No. 
[00:46:30]  No, it says 2001.  I don't know if it was 2001 or 2000, but they weren't together.  Well, that's not 15 years ago.  When did he off himself?  About maybe six, seven years ago.  How do you pull out these numbers?  At first it's 15 years ago, then it's 2001.  I'm not saying that because they weren't even talking.  Yeah, we understand.  You've said that 8,000 times, even though we haven't heard that.  Hold on, Maren.  You have said this happened 15 years ago.  Then you said it happened 2001.  Oh, my God.  2001 or 2000.  And then you said it might have happened five or six years ago. 
[00:47:00]  Were they together, though?  But they weren't even friends.  But they were together when he did it, right?  No.  You are an asshole.  They weren't even friends.  Wait, no!  Stop saying that!  I just don't understand that.  Yes, we do.  Shut up!  Well, let me ask you a simple.  What year did him wave hi to the choo-choo?  I'm not sure which year, okay?  I can't tell.  And at this point, were they still, like, friendly?  No.  So they were going out?  No.  When he jumped in front of the train, they were deeply in love. 
[00:47:30]  So they were just friends?  They weren't married anymore?  No.  Babbling buffoon.  He had come over probably the night before drunk.  He was taking care of his kid.  He was doing what he was supposed to do.  Pay attention, child support, and everything.  Right.  They were sharing custody of Peter when he was a baby.  Yeah.  But he jumped in, which was good.  He was a good guy.  Come on, guys.  All right, well. 
[00:48:00]  I want to let you know, though.  I don't care if you pick on her.  I don't care if you bust on her.  But just leave, you know, the kid out of there.  Stop trying to set ground rules.  Yeah, we don't listen to ground rules.  I wanted to come up to visit, but...  All right.  Hey, hey, hey, Marion.  Marion.  Marion.  Where was it?  Where was the train?  Linden.  Linden, New Jersey.  Yeah.  So he was married to die, and he just killed himself.  No, he was not.  No, they weren't married anymore.  They were just friends. 
[00:48:30]  They were friends, but he...  You know, they had custody.  They shared custody.  I thought you said they weren't friends.  They shared custody of Peter.  They shared it.  He had visitation.  He had custody.  They had visitation.  Visitation.  Yes.  What, was he out drinking that night or something?  No, no.  He wasn't a drinker.  Was it at night or in the daytime?  I think it was early morning.  Early morning.  Was it a commuter or a freight train?  It was an Amtrak.  An Amtrak.  Nice.  The Acela?  I don't know...  Oh, the Acela would take you out in like a second. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, they don't even...  It'd be like a bug on a windshield.  They don't even stop after they hit you.  They're like, eh.  They'll clean it up.  I gotta get to Washington.  Oh.  Come on, guys.  What?  And what was his problem?  I mean, did he...  I don't know.  Because after they split up, I didn't bother with...  Train, train.  Take me on...  No, with that...  I don't...  You know, that happened so long ago.  Yeah.  Train, train.  Lord, take me on out of the... 
[00:49:30]  Here's audio of...  Anthony, he was alive for just a little bit after the train hit him. 
[00:50:00]  I think I got audio of that, yeah.  Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! I can't breathe! Stop! Stop!  That's terrific! That's terrific!  Uh-oh.  Marion! Get out of the way! 
[00:50:30]  But at least he didn't have to deal with Lady Di anymore.  Marion.  You know, they were very close right up until the end.  Marion.  Yeah, that's what I heard.  Marion.  Marion.  Marion.  Marion.  Yeah.  Hello?  Marion.  Hello?  Where'd she go?  Marion. 
[00:51:00]  Wow.  Boy, that Lady Di.  New little tidbits come out every day.  Yeah, people from both of those liars.  It's very interesting.  The listeners are, they either hate when Lady Di and Marion are on the phone, or they love it.  There's no in between.  There's a ton of people that just turn off their radios, and then there's a ton of people that can't get enough of this soap opera that is the retard of the virtue.  I'm fascinated by it because it doesn't, you know, if you get a few minutes of their babbling, it's punctuated by these little tidbits like the guy that is the father of Lady Di's son threw himself in front of a train. 
[00:51:30]  I mean, I don't mean to, you know, throw a pun out there, but who saw that one coming?  I mean, but it makes perfect sense.  That slob, you father that slob's child.  Where is that going to end?  Yeah, choo-choo.  Choo-choo train.  Choo-choo train facial.  He'll be coming around the mountain. 
[00:52:00]  Let he come.  And she didn't want to say anything, and we asked if, I'm sure when that happened, the police questioned her about why he would do something like this, blah, blah, blah, and that was what we were talking about, and that's what she wouldn't fess up to.  No.  She knew the whole time what we were getting at.  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  What?  No, no, that didn't happen.  Oh, no.  No, there wasn't a train.  Five minutes later, yes, a train, and he jumped in front of it, and I'm a lying sack of crap.  Well, we have to get her on the phone now.  Of course we do.  Let's see if we can get her to confess that she wants married to John Henry. 
[00:52:30]  When John Henry was a little baby.  Where's Steve today?  We have to get Martini Steven here before we go break.  Looks like he jumped in front of something.  Oh, my God.  I walked in today, and I just was like, I just started laughing, and he's like, what, what?  I'm like, look, you don't have to worry about me.  He's getting all paranoid.  I'm like, trust me, I'm not going to be the one that's going to make fun of you for the next, I don't know.  How long does it take to grow back in? 
[00:53:00]  You know when he looks like he jumped in front of the gay pride parade?  He got run.  And it hit him dead center.  He got run over by a leather float.  Oh, what an atrocity.  Hey, could someone get him to sashay in here?  I'd like to talk to him.  Where's Steve?  Oh.  If I had the long version of the Martini Steve thing, this would be perfect right now.  You know, any time Opie brings up the Steve, like, gay innuendo thing that you bring up a lot with Steve, I am the first one to jump in and defend this guy. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  All the time.  All right, he wears the flaming clothes.  He watches chick flicks.  He has a bear quality to him.  A big bear quality to him.  He's got the big tattoos and everything.  But I defend him because, yeah, I've seen him and I do truly believe he enjoys the company of girls.  You never had to hug him and comfort him as he's crying on your shoulder, okay?  Look, and I never do. 
[00:54:00]  All right.  Maybe I have some personal experiences with this guy that's a little deeper than yours.  Not in...  It would involve a java log.  Not in that way.  Not in that way, but...  There he is.  There he is.  Hold on a minute.  There he is.  Curse this thing to me.  Where were you, sitting on Snoopy's doghouse?  What?  Oh, yeah.  It's Martini Steve.  Yeah.  You're Martini Steve.  It's Martini Steve.  Hi, Steve.  Hi.  Steve.  Steve, everybody. 
[00:54:30]  I know.  I'm just wondering, what possessed you?  I got an urge to bleach the dew.  I can't settle on a look for more than a month before I look at myself and go, I need a radical  change, whether it's shirts or boots.  Yeah, we can't keep up with his looks.  Sometimes he has to grow the sideburns nice and long and thick.  Then he has kind of the old backstreet thing happening where it's all carved out nice. 
[00:55:00]  It's all over the place, thin mustache and thin beard and, I don't know, sideburns over  here.  Yeah.  Then he chops the whole thing and just goes with the sole patch.  He's got the patch working in front.  But it's more than just the patch.  It's a landing strip.  It's a landing strip from his bottom lip.  Jesus.  And it's blonde hair, bleached blonde.  He just went bleached blonde.  Yeah.  And it's very short.  Yeah.  I had to.  I was actually thinking about doing this a while ago, but I couldn't find a bleaching kit that 
[00:55:30]  didn't have explicit instructions that said, do not put on scalp because it will fry your  scalp.  I found one yesterday or two days ago that actually was specifically made for guys who  want to do this.  How long do you keep that on?  Actually, the instructions said put it on for an hour and a half.  But after 15 minutes, I'm looking at myself going, you know, that's awfully yellow.  Maybe I ought to rinse this off.  And after 15 minutes, it was.  That was 15 minutes.  That was 15 minutes.  And it was blonde as hell. 
[00:56:00]  So.  You didn't go for the eyebrows.  No, you're not supposed to do your eyebrows.  No.  It even says not made for eyebrows.  Do not.  I didn't want my eyebrows to fall off.  So I just.  Well, now that you have that, are you excited about your new channel on Sirius?  Are you?  Quite.  Thank you.  He really looks like Eminem.  I'm Fat Shady.  I'm the Fat Shady.  The real Fat Shady.  Oh, yep.  Yep. 
[00:56:30]  Not all of these image alterations are for the better, I have to say.  They're just.  You know.  They've got his hair.  Sweet facey.  I'm sweet facey.  Yes, I'm sweet facey.  I'm Steve Cozy.  Yes, I'm Steve Cozy.  Wow.  So we go into the office.  He's at his computer working hard for the show, and he has a hat on, and we all knew,  all right, what did you do now?  Yeah.  Last time, he just shaved it completely, you know, to skin.  Mm-hmm.  And then we knew something was going on, and he was kind of hiding. 
[00:57:00]  He showed Ant and I.  But as soon as Norton walked into the office, you just went and just took off the hat and  you're like, all right, here it is.  Here it is.  Have your fun, kids.  Let's get it going.  Exactly.  Let's get it on.  Oh, no.  Any other things you're thinking of for your look?  No, that was pretty much it for now.  I mean, that's not to say that I won't have an urge in about a month or two.  I'm actually thinking about a new ink, but.  Oh, really?  I don't know.  Like I said the other day, you've got to really commit when you want to do the full sleeve. 
[00:57:30]  Forearms.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's kind of, you can't really cover that up with short sleeves.  Do you want to get a tattoo that matches, oh, I'm sorry.  No, that's it.  I was just going to say, if you want to get a tattoo that matches the hair, maybe you  could have a potted plant on one arm and a sick friend on the other.  I don't, is the bleach blonde do particularly queer?  No, not at all.  Not at all.  Well.  Absolutely not.  No.  Well, I'm serious.  There were plenty of people that we saw with very good looking women, you know, at that  dinner that we went to in Vegas that had this do.  So I'm, you know, questioning whether or not it's that.  Right, but they weren't wearing flame boots.  That would look less gay if you had two testicles tattooed on your cheeks. 
[00:58:00]  You should get a Roman war helmet tattooed on your face, and that would be less gay than  that.  Well, thank God it's hair and it grows back.  It brings out your softer side, that's for sure.  Yeah, you don't look as mean and rugged.  You do.  Oh, sweet.  You look sweeter.  You look cozier.  You look sweeter.  I just want to sit next to you like with a little fire going on a bearskin rug and just talk.  He went from like grizzly bear to poo bear. 
[00:58:30]  The one request I got from my wife was, I picked it up on Saturday evening, she said  just please wait until we're done having dinner with my parents before you do that to yourself.  What does she think of all these?  She knows she can't make, she knows she really can't stop me.  Yeah, damn it.  Yeah.  She just, you know, well, she's like, you're going to do whatever the hell you want anyway,  so just please, you know, hold off on making yourself even weirder looking.  Did she offer to drive you to a train station in Linden yet?  No, not yet.  Perhaps that's coming. 
[00:59:00]  Fantastic.  Yes.  So, you know, it's hair.  It'll grow back.  Yeah, and it's short.  It's very short.  Yeah.  So, you know, you could just buzz that off and in two weeks you'll be back to regular  hair cut.  Ten days it'll be.  Lebanese hair grows very quickly.  Yes, it does.  It's very brittle though.  It's like hay almost now.  Oh, really?  Because.  They put a lot of conditioners in the bleaching kit.  Oh, it's like gay, really, not hey.  It burns?  No, it's like hey.  Hey.  Hey. 
[00:59:30]  All right, Steve.  Enjoy your new adieu.  Thank you.  Let me say, Steve, it looks fabulous.  Thank you.  If I may use the word.  That's really what I was going for.  Yes.  Perfect hairdo for wedding vows in Massachusetts.  I think that color would complement material like leather very well.  Buckles, things like that.  I have a lot of leather.  Sure.  I do.  All right, Steve.  It's just awful. 
[01:00:00]  Let her rip.  There he goes.  It's Martini Steve.  Martini Steve.  Hey.  It's Martini Steve.  In honor of Steve, we'll play this little thing and we'll step aside for a few minutes.  A little game we played a few years back called Hi, Mom, I'm, uh, uh, uh, uh, yee-gee.  All right, Bob, are you ready to play Hi, Mom, I'm Gay?  Absolutely.  Now, I hear you're 35 years old.  Yeah.  Never been married.  Ever.  Are you gay? 
[01:00:30]  No rope swallowing.  All right, Bob, let's give it a shot.  All right.  Hello?  Mom, can you hear me, darling?  Yeah.  It's Barbie.  Barbie?  Yeah.  Where are you?  I'm at work.  Yeah, well, you sound awful funny.  Yeah, I know.  All right.  Hey, uh, Mom, you're sitting down.  Why?  I gotta tell you something.  What?  Uh, don't get nervous.  Something I've been meaning to tell you.  I was gonna call you when you called earlier today. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah?  Ah.  I'm gay.  Oh, you're full of s**t.  I'm a twinkie.  I swear it.  Barbie, will you stop it?  You know, I have enough aggravation.  What?  How come you don't, you never believe me?  Because I don't believe you.  Why?  Well, you just had a child, Barbie.  What?  Yeah.  That was to throw you off.  Yeah.  Okay.  You know, I wanted to tell you that.  I was hoping you wouldn't take it lightly, but...  Barbie?  What?  Are you trying to be funny?  I'm not.  I gotta tell you, you know, I just don't feel right. 
[01:01:30]  I've known it ever since I was a kid.  Barbie, are you with Donna?  Not at the moment.  Not at the moment.  All right.  With Lenny.  You can tell your father that.  I'm not even gonna bring it up.  All right.  You're the one that's always said some terrible things about those people.  So what's the, you know, what's all of a sudden?  Well, it was to throw everyone off, you know?  Barbie, I don't believe it.  However, you know.  You still love me.  I've had enough heartache.  I think, you know, good God.  You still love me.  Of course I love you.  You just won't kiss me on the lips anymore, huh? 
[01:02:00]  What the hell are you doing, drinking?  No.  No.  Yeah, all right, all right.  Okay, I'm working.  Your father's out to lunch.  Have you told Gene this?  No, I was gonna spring it on him tonight.  Yeah, that's nice.  Yeah, you do that.  Stand a long distance away, will ya?  I will, out of arms reach.  Barbie, don't give me that baloney, please.  You break my heart when you do things like this.  I'll talk to you later when I can sit down with you.  Yeah, that'd be nice.  All right.  All right.  I love you.  See you later.  I love you, too.  Okay. 
[01:02:30]  Holy Jesus.  Dude.  I gotta get back to her quick, man.  She's gonna put a knife in her wrist.  You better do that.  I don't give her a fuck about nobody in this motherfucker.  Let me show your ass.  Look.  Look.  What the fuck I want to do, man?  What do you want to do, man?  Huh?  Radio for the angry golfer.

[01:04:30]  It's everything 24-7.  XM 202.  The O&A virus.  It's everything.  All the time.  XM 202.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Who's the black pilot did get the successful machine to hold the sheets?  You're damn right.  Who is a man that would risk his net worth of a man? 
[01:05:00]  Damn right.  Can you dig it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Happy.  The shaft is a mad mother.  Shut your mouth.  Happy Martin Luther King Day to everybody.  Doing black rejoiners today.  That's as creative as we get on this program.  Thank you.  Look at what we do now. 
[01:05:30]  Enjoy the brilliance that is the O.P. and Anthony program.  We're right on top of things.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  Martin Luther King Day is Monday.  What do you want to do?  Let's, like, play black music.  Okay.  What else can we do?  I don't know.  We're not very good at diversity.  Hey, it's the O&A virus.  We're spreading across America, like it or not.  We know nothing about Martin Luther King.  We know nothing that we can, like, throw together that would be a fitting tribute. 
[01:06:00]  Because we're just stupid.  Well, a lot of radio guys, they play that YouTube Pride and then this, like, Martin Luther King speeches that are in the song.  Yeah.  Maybe we can find that and we'll play that for everybody today.  Everyone just knows the I Have a Dream speech.  Or just that part of it.  There's another good one.  We were talking about getting to the mountaintop.  Yeah, that one.  That was a great one, too.  Yeah.  Ain't no mountain high enough, that one?  No.  No, he kind of segwayed into that.  He did a song parrot at the end. 
[01:06:30]  Ain't no mountain high enough.  Hey, we all get off, though, for Martin Luther King Day now.  He's a real womanizer.  Except for us.  Martin Luther King, man.  Yeah, he liked the white puss, too, right?  I don't know.  I know that they said in Malcolm X, like, the FBI agent said that X was a monk compared to King.  Really?  He's not actually in China's wife.  He's, like, a real religious guy.  But King apparently.  Is that real, or is that just stuff that they did back then, like, spread around rumors and stuff to just discredit the guy in the community?  Well, no, they would have loved to.  They couldn't discredit Malcolm X that way. 
[01:07:00]  Dude, that's why they, you know, rumors that he was involved with Abernathy, you know, and some weird things.  Yeah.  I don't believe it.  That's why he was marching all over the place.  He had white chicks all over the place he had to go visit.  Finding some girls.  Hell yeah.  All right.  Hell the way, that's a great way to get out of the house, you know?  I gotta go do some marching.  I have to march today, honey!  Baby!  Baby, I've got to go march today!  I have seen the mountaintop, and there are white broads all over it! 
[01:07:30]  I don't know, I tend to think maybe they were trying to discredit him a little bit and kind of threw around those rumors.  Possible.  But who knows?  Yeah.  It is possible.  I'm not educated enough about him to know if those things are true.  Well, the South is checking in.  They're saying it's also Robert E. Lee's birthday today.  Is that true?  Stop it.  Is it?  I don't know.  We'll have to look it up.  That would be a hell of an ironic coinkydink.  All right, well, Norton's back in studio. 
[01:08:00]  You missed Friday's show because he was in Chicago at Zaney's.  How did that go?  I really enjoyed myself, man.  It was one of the most fun I've had at the club.  I gotta thank Zaney's for not dropping checks.  There's like two or three clubs in the country that don't drop checks.  Them and the Stress Factory.  Drop checks.  That means in the middle of the headliner set, you do 45 minutes to an hour, so at like 35 minutes, you put checks down.  And it just ruins.  Oh!  Of course it does.  And the comedy seller doesn't do it to you either, of course not, because they're a great club.  But it ruins the flow of the show because everybody's looking at the checks, paying the bill. 
[01:08:30]  Right.  But these scumbag clubs, it's awful.  Yeah, it's like a table of five, six people, and the bill comes like, okay, it's $250.  Trying to split it.  How much money do you have?  What, what?  And the comedian is still trying to do his thing up there.  A table full of six earls that none of them want to pay the bill.  Oh, not one of them digging into their pocket for a dollar.  Yeah, it's really frustrating, man.  Wow, I never even thought of that.  Well, you got the one alcoholic friend that had like 15 beers, and you had, you were sipping  one beer, and, ah, well, I'll just split it, right?  Hey, split it.  And you sound like an ass if you bring it up. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  But yeah, and usually, the last part of any comedian set is his real strong stuff.  He wants to end strong, and people could care less because they're trying to figure out  their bills.  Yeah.  It was so, I mean, the fact that the Zanies didn't, the only thing that bothered me about  the Zanies, I haven't worked in a club with smoke in it in a while.  So, like, you know, you could still smoke in that club in half the room, and it gave  me a sore throat.  Yeah, well, it's like, I mean, you know, I just get spoiled being in Manhattan.  You're on the road, and that's what you gotta, you know, I was one of the first people  to be like, damn that Bloomberg, you know, taking the cigarettes, people should be able 
[01:09:30]  to smoke wherever they want.  But when you go into a club now, out of state, it just, it is, and you're closed the next  morning, just to read, because usually you just take them off and throw them on the  floor next to the bed.  When you wake up and get out of bed, it's just this waft of smoke.  You do forget.  And bar.  Yeah, the whole Vegas thing, you know.  Yeah.  It was just brutal.  And now, you know, you go into, you work at a club in New York, you go in there to drink  or hang out.  It's amazing. 
[01:10:00]  It's just no smoke.  You gotta love it.  Chicago represented very nicely.  The shows were not sold out because we were just starting up there.  It was actually better than I thought it was gonna be.  And there was quite a few ONA fans there.  Oh, really?  I was really surprised.  Yeah.  I mean, most of the people that came to see me came to see me from the show.  It was really great to see that it's really building nicely and quickly.  So, thank you guys for coming out, man.  It was fantastic.  You're all nice right now.  He called me last night.  I'm trying to eat this stupid Pop-Tart, but you were like just livid last night. 
[01:10:30]  You called me up and you wanted me to remind you about Comedy Club here in New York.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  I'm gonna give them one more day because the process I'm in right now is the Tonight  Show called and said that they wanted me to send a second set because I had done the  one.  And they're like, hey, we'd like to see the other one.  But I didn't do it.  And they called again, Bob and Ross.  They go, look, we'd love to see the set.  Could you send it?  So, what I'm doing this week is I'm just doing quick sets at the Comic Strip and Stand-Up  New York going and doing four and a half to five minutes to try to time out the set. 
[01:11:00]  So, I called another comedy club that has a VCR and I'm like, can I just come in this  week and do these five-minute sets?  And they gave me the runaround last night.  I'm like, well, we kind of got a full thing tonight.  Call it and we'll see tomorrow.  And this is the same club that when I was doing the Tonight Show and I said, look, can I get  on and just do these four-minute sets?  I'm going out to LA next week.  They gave me a hard time.  Oh, boy.  Well, you know, we don't know.  So, if they don't put me on, you know, I'm really going to badmouth them.  But it's like, maybe last night they were booked, so. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, good.  We can expect a badmouthing.  Yeah, it just annoys me, man.  Now you're making me hope they don't put you on.  Yeah, they probably won't.  They're not going to put him on.  Nah, the manager's kind of a douche.  Oh.  He doesn't know anything about comedy.  I'm like, my manager's called.  They're like, look, he's doing the Tonight Show.  He's booked for next week.  Can he get on and just work the set to time it and make sure it's...  Nah, we got a full thing today.  This is what they told me back in September.  Jesus.  It's like, what's wrong with you?  Bastards.  Why do you think we work for $20 a set?  You think I need $20 a night or $10 a night with City Club's pay? 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  When you need a club, it's Gotham.  That's Gotham Comedy Club.  That's the one that is giving me problems.  And it's like, when you need to do this kind of stuff, this is career-making stuff or it  helps your career.  Yeah.  And they're going to give you a runaround?  Tonight Show, for God's sake.  Really aggravating, man.  Really aggravating.  So, we'll see what happens tonight.  But, of course, the comic strip knows that.  Stay Up in New York knows that.  Dangerfield knows that.  Every club in the city will extend that courtesy to you.  Right.  I know the owner of that club for 10 years. 
[01:12:30]  He used to do stand-up.  And I don't think it's coming from him.  But it's very frustrating.  You should talk to him.  I did, but it's like...  Say, hey.  Get a little, you know...  Hey.  Hey, hey, hey.  Come on, now.  I did talk to him.  And he said, no, man, it's no problem.  We'd like to have you.  And then, all of a sudden, the manager's doing this again.  And, you know, we just got a full schedule.  I've seen the schedule.  I'm not saying they're bad comics, but I've been bumped a thousand times by Attell and  all these other guys.  I never mind.  I'm at the cellar sometimes.  And the Conan's people go, hey, so-and-so's doing Conan tomorrow. 
[01:13:00]  I'm like, yeah, put him up in front of me.  I don't care.  Go up.  Do your six minutes.  Do what you got to do, man.  And we all extend that courtesy to each other.  Every club in New York has accommodated me.  Every time I've been in L.A., they've always accommodated for a TV thing, except for the  Gotham Comedy Club.  Comedy Club Diva.  Comedy Club Diva.  He actually wants five minutes when he's doing a television show.  But, you know, I guess I'm not clean enough for that room.  I think they tend to like, you know, the comedy cell is where you go if you want to get punched  in the stomach and laugh.  If your grandmother comes in from Albuquerque and you want to take her to a club, go to 
[01:13:30]  Gotham.  There's nice, fun-for-everyone entertainment.  So, give them a little plug.  Sure.  Give them a little plug.  Thanks once again.  I appreciate that.  Thank you once again for accommodating me.  Very nice.  That doesn't sound very good.  Nah, it stinks.  It stinks.  You done with your Pop-Tart?  Nah.  Nice.  I missed the 10- to 15-minute commercial breaks.  You could get a lot done.  Yeah, a lot of eating going on.  Well, a lot of people get pissed on the instant feedback and stuff, and the email. 
[01:14:00]  We've got to stop eating live on the show, but we have to.  We have to.  It's breakfast time, and we don't- that's what radio guys do when the commercials start  playing.  They go take a dump, they smoke a cigarette, some of them do drugs, some of them drink.  When are we supposed to get our eat on?  We eat.  All right, one other thing from Jim Norton before we move on here.  You just came in with the Village DVD, and you're just completely outraged.  He was livid when he came in.  He was holding it up.  He was speechless. 
[01:14:30]  He just holds it up so he can look at it, and he's just like, this-  You notice what time he came here, too?  Yeah.  Like, 5.20.  We're like, what's wrong?  You have a fever or something?  Been up all night.  But he walks in with the DVD just in his hand.  It's not even in his bag or whatever.  Well, he doesn't have any of that stuff.  He just throws a coat on and comes in here.  Why?  Never mind.  But he's holding the DVD, and he's just ranting and raving about it.  Yeah.  In a bad way.  In Chicago.  And I'm tempted to get on a plane and go get a refund.  This-  That bad. 
[01:15:00]  This piece of crap could be the worst thing I've ever seen in my life.  I actually, at one point, thought that this M. Night Shyamalan, whatever, stupid-  Shyamalan, ding-dong.  Exactly.  It was awful.  I thought this might be a comedy.  I'm like, this can't be serious.  The acting was atrocious.  Atrocious.  The story was atrocious.  The Village.  I would have liked this more if it was about Greenwich Village, and instead of red cloaks, 
[01:15:30]  they all wore chaps and drank out of each other's mules.  Everything you've done-  Freshly bleached hair.  Yeah, starring, I was going to say, starring Martini Steve.  Bunch of cozy creatures in the woods in the village.  They're not monsters.  They're bears.  They just hug you if you cross the magic line.  Beware the sweet face.  It was not a horror film.  I thought the acting was good.  The acting was atrocious.  Now, looking at the commercials for it, it was presented like some type of horror film 
[01:16:00]  in the same vein as, what was the other movie you put out?  Six Sands.  Which was great.  No, Signs.  Yeah.  And Signs.  He put out Signs, so I was thinking it was going to be like that.  I have not seen this movie.  Oh.  Don't worry.  You could ruin it for me.  I don't care.  I won't ruin it for you, but I'll tell you who will.  Well, Joaquin Phoenix, whose next film should be called Breakdancing in Front of the Viper.  Awful.  You didn't like his acting when the retarded character in the film stabbed him? 
[01:16:30]  No, I actually liked when he got stabbed.  I didn't like the fact that he did live.  The only part of the movie I liked is when Adrian Brody's face got slapped, because a  retard being slapped is always amusing.  Always amusing.  Sigourney Weaver stunk.  Now, you're saying the acting's horrible.  William Hurt.  But William Hurt's a great actor.  He was awful.  Sigourney Weaver is a very good actress.  Sure.  She is, yeah.  I suppose so.  Star-studded cast, I might add. 
[01:17:00]  It was amazing how-  Didn't Brody win an Oscar?  He certainly did for the-  For the penis.  Yeah, the piano.  The pianist.  The pianist was the pianist?  Yeah, the pianist.  The pianist.  Who else?  Who's the chick her last name is Howard?  Something Howard?  Yeah.  God, ripping me off, Robin.  Brianna.  She was atrocious.  Whatever, yeah.  Really?  So the acting, horrific.  I thought it was a goof.  There's a clip here where this one woman is thinking of proposing marriage to Joaquin Phoenix. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  And I thought this was meant to be a comedy.  I'm like, this has to be ironic.  She can't really be acting.  So she gets up all the courage and she walks up to him.  It's supposed to be like this 1800 setting.  Yeah.  And he's sharpening a sword.  And if you got the first clip, this is what she said.  This is her telling him that she loves him.  Good afternoon, Lucius.  I wanted to tell you something. 
[01:18:00]  I love you, Lucius.  I love you like the day is long.  I love you more than the sun and the moon together.  And if you feel the same way, then we should not hide it any longer.  It's a gift, love is.  We should be thankful.  We should bellow it out with all the breath in our lungs. 
[01:18:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  That's the next scene after he doesn't react.  That's her crying.  I just wanted that in there because that's how I felt watching this film.  Do you realize that?  Wow, that acting is really bad.  It's like listening to Blair's cousin Jerry do Shakespeare.  It's horrible.  That's Bryce Dallas Howard.  Oh, dude. 
[01:19:00]  Ron's daughter.  That is Ron's daughter.  It is?  I'm like, it has to be his daughter.  We're hurting at acting work.  She is atrocious.  Well, the reviewers, I remember at the time, thought she did a fantastic job with this movie.  Really?  Yeah, that's what I'm just saying.  Now, it's not a horror movie by any stretch of the imagination?  Well, they definitely marketed it as a horror flick.  Yes, they did.  And when I saw it, when the credits started rolling, everyone got really pissed off.  People started throwing some of their refreshments going, that's it?  Really?  That's it?  One of those movies that ends and you're like, oh, no, don't you dare roll the credits. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, this is BS.  That's it?  I actually, I also had Steve, Joaquin Phoenix has this thing he does.  He's on the same success path as Jim Belushi or name someone else who had a more gifted brother  kicked the bucket at a young age.  And he does this thing where he whispers because he really is not a good actor.  So to get emotion, he whispers.  And that's his way of being passionate is he whispers. 
[01:20:00]  And it's enragingly bad.  Because I don't know why actors somehow think that that makes you seem passionate.  It doesn't.  It makes you seem hoarse.  It's awful.  So I have a thing of him and Bryce.  I think this is Bryce or the other dingbat.  This is Joaquin's monologue, I believe.  I love this Jimmy's review.  It's just him and her talking and she says something and he's passionate.  When we are married, will you dance with me?  I find dancing very agreeable. 
[01:20:30]  Why can you not say what is in your head?  Why can you not stop saying what is in yours?  Why must you lead?  When I want to lead.  If I want to dance, I will ask you to dance.  If I want to speak, I will open my mouth and speak. 
[01:21:00]  Everyone is forever blank.  You just be afraid.  I will listen to what you're always asking.  He does do that in a lot of roles.  Here's why.  He stinks.  Oh, Joaquin.  Anybody with a silent J in the beginning of their name is going to stink.  Yeah.  That wasn't his thing, though. 
[01:21:30]  Opie, how do you find your coffee?  Is it good?  It's very good.  How many splinters do you put in it?  One.  I can't believe it.  One.  And M. Night should be, he really should be gutted for writing this dialogue.  And she says to him, on our wedding night, will you dance with me?  I find dancing to be agreeable.  How do you go through a read-through with a bunch of actors and she says that and somebody doesn't throw hot coffee at her?  How does that happen? 
[01:22:00]  I swear to God.  Because they're all agreeable in Hollywood.  I was teetering, thinking that this might be some kind of an ironic parody of horrible acting.  Really?  It was atrocious.  William Hurt is a good actor and he stinks in it.  Nobody was good.  I didn't get any Sigourney stuff.  I believe I can go back through it and have some later this week.  She also was atrocious.  Now, what is it about the story that is so bad? 
[01:22:30]  Well, what's happening in the film, and I won't give it away, is that there are, it's a village.  I kind of like the idea.  Yeah.  Well, that's a wee part company.  I have no idea what it's about.  It's people like, it's like an 1800 setting.  Right.  And they live in this little village and they're walled off from the forest.  They don't go into the forest and the creatures, who apparently are acting coaches, don't come into their village.  The creatures stay in the forest and red is the bad color.  The forest, I'm going to the forest. 
[01:23:00]  I'm going to the forest.  Don't go into the forest or anywhere near the Golden Globes.  So, they stay in the village.  And, of course, you're going to have that overachiever that has to go in the forest.  Of course.  Yes.  That's the bad part of the movie.  So far, nothing bad.  Yeah, but you know somebody that knows nothing about this.  That's what I hate about Hollywood.  You watch these movies like, oh, let me guess.  There's going to be an overachiever that has to push the limits of the village and has to go see what's out there.  Well, because this is such an original concept, there is a council of elders, which was just such a conceptually brilliant thing for a film. 
[01:23:30]  And, at one point, I don't want to give anything away, Joaquin Phoenix is stabbed by a retard.  Adrian Brody stabs him when he finds out that Joaquin is going to marry the girl that he likes, who's blind, by the way.  Not the one who said, I love you, we should shout it.  Not that one.  No.  But the one who said, I would like to dance.  Dancing is agreeable.  I guess because you'll never drive, whore, because you're blind. 
[01:24:00]  She's the one who...  It's the 1800s.  Yeah, that was a good point.  Well, but it's not the 1800s, Anthony.  Oh, oh, oh.  Whoops.  Oh, no.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, no, no.  You wrecked it.  Oh, oh, oh.  Wow.  All right.  Now, that's kind of a cool twist.  Wait, it's not a cool twist.  No?  It stinks.  It's not?  There's one part where the girl wants to go into the towns for the medicine.  I've got to recover from this.  Yeah.  That is a complete ruin of the movie. 
[01:24:30]  They have to go into the town to get medicine for Joaquin or he's going to die.  For Joaquin Phoenix is going to die.  Because, see, they're living like it's the 1800s.  Of course.  But his injury is such that there's medicine that they have to get from the town.  The town.  Yeah.  So, she's preparing to go into the woods.  The blind girl is going to walk through the woods to the town.  Because she's the best choice.  Are you kidding me?  And William Hurt gives a speech to the other elders because they're like, look, you're risking  what we built here, this private thing, by sending her into the town where she may, 
[01:25:00]  you know, run into Sanford Meisner.  So, this is exactly what's going on.  And William Hurt, I took some of his monologue to the other elders.  The elders.  And this is his bit of overacting atrocity.  Right?  Who do you think will continue this place, this life?  Do you plan to live forever?  It is in them that our future lies.  It is in Ivy and Lucius that this way of life will continue. 
[01:25:30]  Yes, I have risked.  I hope I am always able to risk everything for the just and right cause.  Oh, yeah.  That makes my skin crawl.  And again, I can't blow the ending, but the fact is that the whole movie, you think it's  the 1800s, and then she crosses a fence and sees a park ranger, and you do realize that  they're living in modern times.  And by the way, there are no creatures.  They're just red suits that the elders keep.  There's no creatures.  No creatures.  The elders have these red creature suits. 
[01:26:00]  And every once in a while, they throw them on just to scare her.  And go into the woods and come out of the woods.  But sometimes they come into the actual village.  Oh, yeah.  Scare them a little bit just to keep them under control.  Uh-huh.  The elders are all...  Hence religion and fear in society, everybody.  Hence religion and fear in society.  He had a message.  It certainly wasn't good film writing.  Hey, do the elders know about the, like, about the, what times they're living in?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The elders know.  The elders were all crime victims in real life, so they decided to build this peaceful, 
[01:26:30]  crime-y place.  This perfect society.  It's a perfect society.  But what we learn is even a perfect society has a problem.  Right.  And in this case, it was the retard guy.  The writing and the directing, yeah.  So I hope any of you that thought of, went out to buy this DVD, I hope I ruined it for  you.  There's no creatures.  There might be two scary moments.  The most horrifying part is when the credits roll and you realize you got suckered in to  buying this piece of garbage.  It is horrendous.  Everything he's done since the sixth sense has gotten progressively worse. 
[01:27:00]  But he's making a statement about religion and how religion controls a society and how  fear controls a society from free thinking.  Here's a statement about religion he's making.  You can strap this film to your waist and run onto a bus in Tel Aviv.  It is horrendous.  The village stunk.  Now, if you ask me, not having seen the movie, but now having been told the plot and everything,  it sounds like a Twilight Zone.  It sounds like it could be a Twilight Zone episode. 
[01:27:30]  But terribly done.  And the writing was so weak.  And the story was so weak.  Had they thrown that twist at the end and it was well acted and well done and scary?  It might have been like, whoa.  Look, on the outside, not having seen the movie, it sounds like a good idea.  It was a good idea.  It actually sounds like a good idea for a movie.  Right.  Atrocious.  I was livid when I was...  Do you understand?  I wanted to go to bed last night.  I took cough medicine.  That makes me sleepy.  Instead, I said, let me whack my bag one time and then watch this.  And I couldn't sleep. 
[01:28:00]  I was so aggravated.  Wow.  And I think the final...  One of the final lines of the movie was,  My darling, my blood.  No.  I don't know what that is either.  And then...  No?  No.  Wrong film.  Oh, I'm sorry.  That's the end of another film.  I really hope that somebody out there was planning on buying this DVD and it's ruined for you. 
[01:28:30]  Really fast because a couple people wanted to defend the movie.  Oh, yeah?  Jimmy.  Eric from Nebraska.  Eric?  Of course.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  What's up, Nebraska?  Well, you know, I've been listening to your show since October.  Loved the show, you know, but...  I hate the show myself, but thank you.  I'll tell you, Jimmy, maybe you should go out and get a hooker because you should be in a really pissed off mood this morning.  The Village is an awesome movie. 
[01:29:00]  Listen, first of all, you live in Nebraska.  You just like it because with the 1800s, that looked like futuristic and modern to what you're used to out there.  The movie stunk.  Someone doesn't like wide open spaces, eh?  I love wide open spaces.  Eric, what did you like about the movie?  Well, you know, I've watched all of M. Night Shyamalan's work, and he's a hell of a writer in the sense that he will drag you one way and then give you that thought twist at the end.  Yeah, like everybody else in Hollywood does now.  You go left, you go right, and there's the guy in the middle with no money going, eh, what do you want from me?  It stinks. 
[01:29:30]  It looks familiar.  No, not everybody can be wrong.  And, you know, you're a hell of a comedian, but apparently you don't know shit about acting.  I know a lot about acting, and I know awful acting.  Believe me, I like good actors.  I'm disgusted that Jamie Foxx didn't win Best Actor.  They're the only one Best Actor for a musical comedy.  I know a lot about acting.  You've come back.  And every once in a while, Hollywood will surprise you and throw you a twist, because I really thought that Morgan Freeman was going to be the one that died.  Uh-huh.  Well, you know.  Now I know.  I just wanted to send the movie a little bit here and say hello to you guys. 
[01:30:00]  Dude.  Maybe my words ain't worth much, and that's fine.  Dude, the Village was atrocious.  This, the twist, it cheated.  The story was so weak and all over the place and boring.  That's a cornball love story between that dullard Joaquin Phoenix and this stupid blind broad who walks through the woods.  And then Adrienne Brody, at the end, escapes because he tried to kill somebody.  And then he puts on the red monster suit, and she stands in front of an open hole and then steps away at the right moment. 
[01:30:30]  And Adrienne Brody runs and falls and dies in the hole.  The blind girl found the hole in the woods and knew to step away, so the retard in the monster costume.  And this idiot from Nebraska is clawing up like it's Citizen Kane.  It's stunk.  All right, Bob from Jacksonville wants to defend the village as well.  Go ahead, Bob.  Morning, shit, Dicks.  How you doing, man?  Home of the Super Bowl.  Hey, Jimmy, stick to comedy, man. 
[01:31:00]  I thought the movie, it was a little frustrating through the middle of it, and toward the end, it just all came together, man.  I love that movie.  Yeah, but you know what it seems like to me?  Again, not having seen the movie, it seems like a story like that, where the end is the big twist, that you've got to then fill up the entire movie with some type of story.  Like, you could have, all right, it's the 1800s, Monsters in the Woods, at the end we're going to show you it's not the 1800s, and go. 
[01:31:30]  Now you've got to fill it up with what, a crappy love story was in there?  See, the whole thing was, here's what he was trying to do, here's what he was trying to do, he was rushing, he thought he had this brilliant plot twist, and this amazing ending, so the whole film was basically built to try to justify this thing he probably envisioned, and it was crap.  When you look at The Sixth Sense, that was, to me, great.  It was a great movie, it was well written, it was believable, it caught me off guard, it blew me away.  This was crap.  I wanted to be blown away, and it made me physically ill. 
[01:32:00]  It could have been a half hour Twilight Zone.  Dude, it was, the Twilight Zone would have done it better, they would have done it right.  They would have known how to act.  All right, let's go to Chris in New York.  Chris, go ahead.  How you doing?  Hey, good, man.  I rented the movie over the weekend, actually I bought it, one of my friends recommended it to me, and after I was done watching it, I drove by his house and threw it out his window.  Thank you.  It was horrible.  Dude, I bought it too, I'm so aggravated.  That's hilarious.  Let's go to Johnny B on Long Island.  Johnny B.  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[01:32:30]  Johnny B.  Hi, Cuddle Bunny.  Hi, Johnny B.  Jimmy, I gotta defend you 100%.  I have never been to a movie where everybody in the movie theater for opening night said, wow, that sucked.  Yeah, that's what I got when I went.  Everyone was like, around me going, I can't, what?  That's it?  I gotta see it just to see how bad it is.  I'll loan you my DVD.  Don't waste your time, don't waste your time.  And don't even bother.  What do you think about seeing Napoleon Dynamite?  Don't, don't.  I saw Napoleon Dynamite.  You like?  It was really weird, but it's funny. 
[01:33:00]  It's funny.  It's one of the, it's a goofy movie.  I mean, it was funny.  It doesn't really have a real story to it, but the characters are kind of funny enough that  it carries it.  Yeah.  I think if you watched it a few times, it's one of those movies that if you watch a few  times, you'll get certain parts of it that'll really make you laugh.  Yeah.  Trevor in Jersey.  Trevor?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  The retard's parents laughing, crying at the end, after they found out he was dead, made  up the whole rest of the movie for me.  I thought that made the whole movie. 
[01:33:30]  Why, was it funny?  Yeah, you didn't laugh your ass off.  I'm trying to remember.  Did they say that Ivy killed a monster in the woods and the parents just started crying  their eyes out?  Well, yeah, because they knew it was the retard, but by that point, dude, I was crying with  them because I had sat through it.  It was horrible.  How did they get around?  How did they get around?  Things like airplanes and stuff.  Oh, oh, oh.  They tried to cover that.  There's a scene.  This arrogant ass put himself in a scene because he thinks he's Hitchcock.  Yeah, he put himself in a scene. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, he has to be in all his movies.  And after they realized that it's actually modern times, one of the park rangers is talking  to his boss, and he's going like, hey, man, look, you're only there to guard the preserve.  It's some kind of wildlife preserve that we're a couple miles in, and we pay the planes  off not to fly over.  It was like the cheapest tie-in.  Way out.  Yeah, dude, it was such a cheap, like, let's tie this loose end without any real thought  into it.  Yeah.  It stunk.  And the village itself, how big was it about?  Oh, a few houses, five or six houses.  It was like a little village. 
[01:34:30]  So it could have been in there without being detected.  Red was the bad color.  Apparently, the entire script was written in it.  How many years had they been there?  Well, I guess the people who started out, you have to assume these adult children had  been there since childhood or whatever, or adulthood.  Maybe 20 years.  20 years.  20 years.  The elders came in 20 years.  The elders.  The elders.  All right, one more.  James from Connecticut, then we'll move on.  Go ahead, James.  Yeah, I agree with you a little, Jimmy.  That movie sucked. 
[01:35:00]  Sucked.  My wife bought it, and it made a big thing about it.  We're sitting in front of the TV surround sound.  The best part was when she fell in that hole.  Yeah.  It sucked.  Dude, I was so mad, I wanted to throw myself in front of a train.  Oh, and to compare it to the Twilight Zone.  Oh, you just killed the Twilight Zone.  That was way better.  Hey, did you see, I'll tell you what blew me away that I absolutely loved and I thought  was going to be overrated.  I saw Ray, and I thought that was phenomenal.  I didn't expect to like it. 
[01:35:30]  I'm like, ah, this will probably be blown out of proportion, but it was great, man.  It was horrible, but I agree with you.  Does he die at the end?  All right, thanks, buddy.  No, but he actually, he actually, like, wings and says, I can see.  You know, I'm trying to move on.  Another Hollywood twist.  Yeah.  I'm trying to move on, but there's one more here.  Let's say hi to Eric.  Go ahead, Eric.  Oh, hi, Owen A. Love the show.  How are you doing, Cuddle Bunny?  Hey, what's up, Eric?  I was just calling because the one major plot point that nobody's mentioned so far in that  movie that sucked were those boxes of doom that were in every one of the elders' houses. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, yeah.  The boxes of dooms.  They were not put out of sight.  They were right in the middle of everybody's living room.  What is it?  Well, there were boxes of newspaper clippings from their old lives, like boxes  of, you know, the atrocities that happened to each elder.  Like, in real life, every one of them had a loved one murdered or something, and that's  why they all banded together and created this little place where there was no crime or real 
[01:36:30]  acting or any type of directing or writing.  This little magical place where any twist you throw in is going to wrap the audience  up into a neat little package.  Jim, their own nirvana.  Their own nirvana.  Excellent point.  They all had these boxes out in plain sight, and it was just horrible because nobody even  looked in the boxes.  Yeah.  And that's where they kept everything.  All right.  Anyway, the movie sucked.  I'm punching out.  It was just awful.  And the monster costumes were horrible.  Yeah, what were they?  Well, it was like a red cloak because all monsters have red cloaks.  Cloaks.  And a big, dumb monster face. 
[01:37:00]  And it looked like it had thin branches coming out of its back.  It was corny and awful.  I saw more believable monsters on Davy and Goliath.  They were scarier as claymation than these awful monsters were.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  We get the point.  A review of The Village states that Shyamalan and Ding Dong lifted the surprise ending almost  directly from 100 yards over the rim, an episode of The Twilight Zone starring Cliff Robertson  that originally aired in 61.  I remember that one.  A ship goes up into space, crashes on some planet. 
[01:37:30]  But the astronauts kill each other off, or at least one of them is really crazed and  killing the other ones off to get their water and supplies so he could live a little longer.  And they're looking for any type of stuff to keep them alive, water, a lake, something.  And one guy climbs over the rim, looks down, and sees a telephone pole and a road and realizes  they had crashed back on Earth and they weren't on a distant planet.  So kind of similar twist. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  If you're going to put a twist at the end, just make it believable.  Make sure.  Stephen King talked about it in Misery, where Kathy Bates' biggest complaint in the book  was that he cheated on one of the books.  He cut to a different point without the logical progression.  That's what this did.  So you're saying he should be hobbled?  I absolutely believe that.  I hope that M. Nightshall faces a humble in the wrong direction.  Because actually in the book, in the book, Stephen King is good. 
[01:38:30]  In the book, he wasn't hobbled.  She took a hatchet and chopped his foot off and then blowtorched the wound.  And she also cut off one of his fingers and put it in a birthday cake.  And the book was great.  Much better.  Wonderful.  All right.  That should happen to him.  Except it should be his writing hand put in a cake.  So the next time he tries to type a twist, you're a dumb Indian and your movie stunk.  Ugh.  All right.  Let's take a break, Anthony.  All right.  Jimmy's movie review.  I like it.  We like your movie review.  I like it.  As we go to break, Bush is going to do that inauguration thing. 
[01:39:00]  Yes, he is.  So we'll play this.  It's kind of cool.  It's Imagine and Walk on the Wild Side.  You'll hear those two songs in Bush's speeches here.  Check it out.  Imagine there's no heaven.  It's easy if you try.

[01:45:30]  Hey woman  Hey woman  Once you come over to my place  I'll show you what a real man's like  Love that  James Brown  Rocky III, I think the best of the Rockies  Really?  I like the one with Clubber Lang  You thought that was the best one?  Yeah  I kind of like that one  Nothing beats the original  Come on, Anthony  Yeah, the original was amazing  Maybe as far as all the other movies  Because what, they got up to Rocky 10 or something?  That got ridiculous  So Rocky won  The original the best  And then maybe  I would have to agree with you 
[01:46:00]  As the second best movie  Yeah?  Yeah  I don't know  The first one's really hokey if you watch it  They're all hokey  I mean  But the first one's like  All you want to do is go the distance  I kind of like that  You see Sly on the Golden Globes last night?  No, I missed that  What the hell are they pumping his head up with?  His head is so big and round  And it looks like he's definitely had some work done  Yeah  They all have had work done  It's really odd to look at  I think the guy's pushing 60 at this point  I know  You're right  He has to  Yeah  The original Rocky came out 30 years ago 
[01:46:30]  Yeah  Wow  They had to be at least mid-20s by then, right?  Yeah  Yes, Eric?  His whole little speech was how he was complaining  That Clint Eastwood made a boxing movie without him  Yeah  And directed and rode and scored and everything  Did it himself  He ripped me up  Who, who?  Clint Eastwood has a boxing movie out?  Haven't seen that one yet  Apparently, so I've heard  Yeah  Anyway  Anthony, really fast  I got a quickie  We hate Cindy Adams 
[01:47:00]  Oh, she's funny, Ope  Come on  We absolutely hate this bitch  I like her  She writes for the New York Post  And I guess she's  What is she?  Is she a gossip columnist officially?  I have no idea  She's one of these socialites, I guess, in Manhattan  And she thinks she's in the know  The know-it-all  She knows the hot scenes  And she knows  They're leeches  She throws parties  And everyone wants to hang with Cindy Adams  Because she knows what's going on  And then some of these celebrities call her with a little gossip 
[01:47:30]  And little things  She seems like the type that shows up at these parties  And writes about it  But the truth of the matter is  I think she just knows people  That go to these things  And give her reports  Because she's ancient now  She can't be going out  Hanging out until, what, 3 in the morning  Going to Puffy's party and stuff  She's probably got people that just call her up  And go, yeah, I saw this one, that one, and that one  They were doing this  I'm a little distracted, though  They're saying it's  Oh, that the song we just played from James Brown  It's from Rocky 4, not Rocky 3  Is that possible?  Rocky 4? 
[01:48:00]  What was the plot of Rocky 4?  Rocky 4 is when he goes to fight the Russians  Was it?  Maybe it was  I don't know  At the end, he makes that great speech  Yeah, that would make sense  That it was in Rocky 4  Because he's fighting the Russians  Living in America  What song was he playing when he was  Maybe Eye of the Tiger  Oh, maybe Eye of the Tiger?  No  Not when he wasn't working out properly  No  No?  No, when he was  I know what you've seen you mean  When he's in the gym smiling  The girl gives you a kiss  And Mickey goes  Get the hell out of here  Yeah, because he's  Mickey C-Blocks him  It's a spectacle  Yeah, yeah  It was one of those  It was that scene 
[01:48:30]  Oh, here's another cringe  I did see his brother, though  What's his name?  Frank Stallone?  Frank Stallone, like in the back of the shot  So maybe he was singing something  Did you see in part 4 at the end  When he makes the speech  About how the Russians and the Americans  Could get along?  Oh  That's everything that Stallone is  Is an ass  It's like that's exactly your idea  Of what a poignant statement is  An ass  That he wrote a movie  Where at the end  The Russians are actually chanting  For Rocky  Rocky  Yeah 
[01:49:00]  Oh  Pompous ass  It just makes you  It makes you get like goosebumps  I want to do that  I want to make that a new feature  To bring in awful acting moments  And Stallone is going to have  About 30 of the top 50  Horrible  Well, we could  The listeners will help us out with that  It's their show, too  It's not over  I thought that was overrated  It's over, Johnny  If you know of a bad  It's over  Nothing is over  Nothing  You just don't turn it off  How about your career after Judge Dredd?  That would be over, wouldn't it?  Stupid  We could have the listeners start 
[01:49:30]  Setting in their  What they think is bad acting moments  It was Rocky 3?  James Brown is in Rocky 4  Eye of the Tiger is Rocky 3  Eye of the Tiger is Rocky 3  Yeah, but I don't know what the song was  What was he playing in that scene, though?  What was the song in Rocky 2?  Rocky 2?  Was there a song in Rocky 2?  Was there a definitive song?  I love Rocky 2, man  That was great  Well, he wins  Because he finally wins  I like Paul yelling at him  Get out, Rocky!  It was great  Burt Young  That wastes space  I just like the fact that Adrian had hair like Lady Di 
[01:50:00]  Anyway, back to Cindy Adams  So she writes for the Post  They give her a whole page  I don't know, a few times a week  Yeah  And it's always really just bad stuff  It just amazes me  There's no one else out there that could write columns  For these big metropolitan newspapers  Where you would read it and go  Wow, that's kind of  Kind of clever  Kind of funny  Yeah, they have these people  And they work for these papers until they die  And that's pretty much it  They have a job until they die 
[01:50:30]  So she's in there  With absolutely no concept of what anybody in this day and age  Does, relates to, enjoys  This woman is completely out of touch  Yeah, well she really  I guess she thinks she has a funny bone  Because she was married to a comedian  Joey, Joey Adams  Comedian back in the 30s  During the Borscht Belt  You know, when I was in Vaudeville  Does she end the column this time with 
[01:51:00]  Only in New York, kids  Kids  Only in New York  Honestly, I didn't even get to the end of this  This is only half of it  And it's quick  What's on for 2005?  We're into this new year  Predictions?  Kind of her predictions  Ooh-ha  All right  Ooh  A little spin on all the predictions that are out there  Oh, these are going to be good  Ah  She's good  Anna Nicole Smith  On your laughing hat  Puts out her own line of fruitcakes  Prime ingredient  Nuts 
[01:51:30]  Yeah  That is if she doesn't eat the entire shipment herself beforehand  Why is this in a paper?  I'll tell you what would have been funnier  If she said  Mabel King puts out her own line of fruitcakes  And then eats them  And has to have both of her legs cut off  Due to the sugar intake  Yeah, that would be fun here 
[01:52:00]  Oh  Well, she continues  I only picked out a few  I mean, it goes on forever  Oh, let's get a bunch of them in  Oh, I want people to laugh  This is a comedy program  Yeah  All right  The next one  An Afghan cave publishes a Where's Waldo type book titled  Where's Osama?  Ha ha ha ha ha  What year is this for?  2005  A Finding Osama joke?  And she has to explain the joke by making sure  Where's Waldo? 
[01:52:30]  You know what I mean?  Yeah  Awful  You know what would have been funnier there?  If she said that somebody swung a bat at her stomach  And then they made a book called Where's My Uterus?  Ha ha ha ha ha  Well, I'm laughing at that line, so sure  Um, what's on for 2005?  Paris Hilton becomes a nun, everybody  Oh, I get it  Ha ha ha ha  She's a whore  Ha ha ha ha ha  That's terrific  That's terrific 
[01:53:00]  That's terrific  You know what would have been funnier, though?  If she said Michael Jackson becomes a priest  And then takes the altar boys and makes finger puppets out of them  Ha ha ha ha  Oh  Oh  Ha ha ha ha ha  Oh  Ha ha ha ha ha  Oh, sure  Oh, she's nuts, though  What a hoot  Yeah  Uh, the next one, um, Bill Maher adopts the Olsen Twins  God damn it  Are you  Whoa, whoa 
[01:53:30]  Ha ha ha  See?  Good save  It's not all that easy, is it?  It comes to you  It wasn't me  All right, all right  Don't  Bill Maher what?  Yeah, I know, I stepped on it  Bill Maher adopts the Olsen Twins  What?  What?  What does that even mean?  I don't know  What?  Bill Maher adopts the Olsen Twins  Now, you know how she could have made that funnier?  Oh  Andrea Yates adopts the Olsen Twins  Ha ha ha ha  Ha ha ha ha  Ah  See, it's just a little wording there  Glug, glug 
[01:54:00]  I guess she's saying that Bill, though, you know, is pretty racy  Is that what it is?  Yeah, she's good  What the hell are you talking about?  Exactly  Oh, Cindy  You know, watch Cindy  She's encouraging  You haven't made it out yet  I want to see if you could go through this whole list with us  What?  Now I'm going to put the pressure on you  So far, you've had a much better line  Kick the field goal  John Kerry enters politics, everyone  Oh, assuming, well, because of his turnout in the election  That he hasn't been in politics 
[01:54:30]  Ha ha ha ha  But you know what?  He did pretty well  The guy got a lot of  What is she talking about?  She's just ironic like that  Condoleezza gets a crew cut  What?  This is Cindy Adams in the post over the weekend  Condoleezza gets a crew cut  What does that mean?  Predictions for 2005  Why?  What?  Yes  That's only funny if Condoleezza gets her crew cut 
[01:55:00]  Because isn't she the Secretary of Defense  So she's like an Army guy, girl thing  So don't they get crew cuts  Civilian post  So she has to now cut her hair  Because she's doing a man's job  And usually the men have the flat-top Marine thing going on  Wow  How about this?  Cindy Adams gets a crew cut by Iman Alzawari  Still counting 100, my friend 
[01:55:30]  I should have went with Alzarkawi  But you know  It's okay  It works  All them chink villages sound the same  You know  Drim drum  This one will make you puke  Oh?  This one will make you puke  Mini-me  Becomes basketball commissioner  Oh  See, it's a height joke  Because he's really short  And everyone in the NBA is really tall  So  It might have been funnier 
[01:56:00]  Oh no  She said  Mini-me  Falls out of the ocean in Modesto  And yells  I'm home, Pop  Mama, this for you  Still betting 100, my friend  Oh  Very good  That was off the center field wall  I might add  Queen Elizabeth 
[01:56:30]  Predictions for 2005  According to the witty Cindy Adams  In the New York Post over the weekend  Queen Elizabeth learns  Plastic eyeglasses do not go with a tiara  Ha ha ha  Oh  Hee ha  God damn it  Are you fucking with me?  That one will just let sit there  Robert Blake, everyone  Prediction for 2005  He's voted president of the NRA 
[01:57:00]  Anyone else getting really uncomfortable?  Hello, exactly!  Exactly  Captain Obvious with your humor  That's just brilliant  She's absolutely atrocious  That's just brilliant writing  Amber Fry  Buys waterproof mascara  Wow  I almost respect that  That's almost good  But I think it's got something to do with tears 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, yeah  Crying  No, it's just because she cries wherever she is  Oh, see  I thought maybe she was really going to some  Opie and Anthony show humor  No, no, no  It's because every interview she's done lately  She's in tears  Dump her off the boat  At least her mascara won't run  Now that's funny  How about Cindy Adams comes home  And there's a non-skeleton sitting there  Wait, someone is disagreeing that you're not batting 100  Which line didn't it?  1,000 they're probably saying 
[01:58:00]  Oh, yeah, okay  Steve  Yeah, go ahead  Go ahead  Steve  Hey, Jimmy's not batting the hand 100  He didn't get one back for  Oh, there's a couple I don't have him back for  Oh, yeah, yeah, no  He's only, you know  He's picking and choosing his pitches  Yeah, I haven't seen these, dude  If I saw them and had a few minutes  Maybe I could have put something together  Yeah, no, he's picking and choosing his pitches  A couple of them are way outside  He couldn't really swing at them  Hello, exactly  Some of these are so bad 
[01:58:30]  You can't even swing at the pitch  Is what we're getting at here  Al Sharpton takes up the cause of unemployed Scandinavians  Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute  Because he typically does black things  Right  And Scandinavians  Are as white as you get  Don't need help  Because they go to work on their own  Yeah, it's just a little bit  I think albinos would have worked better in that joke  Probably 
[01:59:00]  If I'm thinking like Cindy Adams  She really should have her knuckles smashed  You bounding incompetent  All right, what's on for 2005 for Donald Trump?  Well, he's going to manufacture a line of hair products, everyone  Oh, enough with Donald's hair  Yeah  She went with that one  God  Here's a funnier one  Nancy Reagan comes out with her own line of bras  There you go 
[01:59:30]  Another base hit for Jimmy  Let's see  Well, predictions for 2005  Chinese takeout takes out the MSG, everyone  And Italian takes out  And the Italian takeout takes out the carbs  Uh-huh  Italian takeout takes out the carbs  This is horrific  She wrote that and smiled  Like she was happy with herself  This is the New York Post 
[02:00:00]  Joaquin Phoenix should be acting this out as dialogue  Take out the carbs  God  The carbs  This is the best that  Condoleezza Rice  The post has to offer its readers  Oh my god  Krookat  Krookat  Krookat  Krookat  I'm Nicole  Eating fruit  If I want to dance, I'll ask you to dance  Yuck  Yuck  Hello, exactly 
[02:00:30]  Hello, exactly  Hello, exactly  By the way, you know  That's my favorite clip right now  I love that one  You really need to use that more often  Boogie Nights  Dirk Diggler  Hello, exactly  Alright, um  Moving on  Prince Charles takes out the garbage, everybody  Yeah  Is that where it ends?  That's it, yeah  This is what's on for 2005, according to  Oh, because he has servants  The funny and  Oh  And witty Cindy Adams  Chris Matthews takes humble lessons 
[02:01:00]  Uh-huh  What's a humble lesson?  A humble lesson  That's the best she could do to say he was pompous?  Yeah  A humble lesson  You need a humble lesson, sir  Maybe he could eat some humble pie  There's just a few more  Eat some humble pie  Randy  I wish that Joaquin Phoenix were in Boogie Nights  Can I kiss you?  Please  Do you want to kiss me?  I just got my car painted 
[02:01:30]  You want to see it?  Do you want to kiss me or?  Oh, you got that!  Of course  Of course we got it  And then this  I'm going to kiss you on the mouth  Oh  With his belly hanging out of that shirt  That fat stomach  Right  Multi-colored tight shirt  His fat gut  Put your shirt back down  Please play that again  I'm going to kiss you on the mouth  He's the best actor working  And then this one  He is the greatest  And then this one  I'm a fucking idiot  I'm a fucking idiot 
[02:02:00]  I'm a fucking idiot  That's fantastic  I'm a fucking idiot  I'm a fucking idiot  Fucking idiot  Fucking idiot  Fucking idiot  That is fantastic  Alright  Cindy Adams  More predictions for 2005  Randy Johnson enrolls in Dale Carnegie's  How to Win Friends and Influence People  Who does? 
[02:02:30]  Randy Johnson  Ah  I thought he'd need humble lessons  Yeah, he should take a humble lesson  Humble lesson  Down at the old humble school  Let's see  There's just a few more  I mean, there's so many  It just goes on and on  You know what would be funny  In 2005  If Cindy Adams does a split  In her kitchen  And leaves a slug trail  On the linoleum  And then picks up two tiles  When she stands up  Alright  Scott Peterson  No longer buys appliances 
[02:03:00]  With lifetime guarantees  Joey Adams comes back  And bites her in the neck  Pamela Anderson  Buys a turtleneck dress  What?  A turtleneck dress  Oh, because she's always showing her cleavage  Yeah, so that's just brilliant  You just don't understand comedy  She's the greatest, I know  Nicole Kidman shops at Target  Wears expensive clothes  And one more  I mean, there's a million of them  But  And then she talks about diets 
[02:03:30]  I can't even be bothered  Tara Reid actually goes to bed  When it hits nine  That's the hour  Not the guest list  Wait  Yeah  Wait, what?  Want me to read it again?  Tara Reid actually goes to bed  When it hits nine  Because, you know, she's a party girl  Right, right  She's out much later than nine o'clock 
[02:04:00]  Alright  And that's not bad enough  That's the hour she goes to bed  Not the guest list  Because, see, she's known to  Have a lot of sex  And so maybe there's like  Nine people in her bed  Nine people  She goes to  To bed  When  Does it say bed or sleep?  Yeah, it says bed  She goes to bed  When it hits nine  When it hits nine  That's the hour 
[02:04:30]  Not the guest list  Maybe the amount of people  She's bringing to bed  Yeah, I'm sure that's what  She's going for  But  That makes less sense  Than humble lessons  You know what I want to do?  I want to sit Cindy Adams down  And give her a pap smear  With a work boot  God  Oh, is that awful  I'm sorry, everyone  I'm sorry I brought that  To the table today  But I couldn't help it  I was reading that yesterday  Going  They're joking with us 
[02:05:00]  The New York Post  Is a huge paper  And this is all  They have to offer  Oh dear  Oh dear  Yes  Oh dear indeed  And there's a big twist though  The whole time  You think she's funny  But it turns out  She's living in modern times  Yeah  And the creatures  In the woods  She was avoiding  Were good jokes  Hey  Joe from Jersey  With one last prediction  Yo dudes  If you read  Number 23  It says  He still doesn't care  I don't care 
[02:05:30]  That was awful  If you said  Who who doesn't care  Then everyone  Would have been in  On the joke  And then I would have  Been able to play  The Kevin Meaney thing  I don't care  I don't care  We would have played  That for a little while  And then we went  Right into break  And it would have been  A nice perfect  Radio segue  Yeah  But now because  He blew that line  We just kind of  Sit here awkwardly  Trying to figure out  How we could go  To break smoothly  Thanks ass

[02:14:00]  David Steinberg  We met that guy  He's a Robin Williams guy there  Yeah  Anyway Anthony  We don't have actual audio  Well we have Robin Williams  But what we want to focus on  Was the red carpet  Because that was a big deal  This year  Because you had  Star Jones  And  Joan and Melissa  Going at it  Star Jones man  She has lost a lot of weight  She's lost a lot of weight  And normally  This would be a good thing  Her head  I cannot take my eyes off of it 
[02:14:30]  It looks like  They popped  A California raisin  Onto her head  Onto her shoulders  It's just still  Like her head is still fat  Well you know what  I got some advice  For these fatties out there  Sometimes it's just good  To be fat  Fat  Yeah because  You know  I'm looking at a picture  Of Star Jones  In one of these rag magazines  Let me see the Star Jones  The Us Weekly  And they have a picture  Of Star Jones 
[02:15:00]  After she lost a lot of weight  She's still fat  She's still fat  So what happens is  You're still fat  But now you're saggy fat  Yeah  You know  She was  I think she's disgusting  Quite frankly  But at least she was  Fat and robust  And now she's just  Fat and saggy  Fat and  You're still considered  A fat person  But she is wearing clothes  That she thinks  You know  She looks good in  And this stuff  Oh  I mean plunging necklines  Where that cleavage is  She got like  Three feet of cleavage  Well the cleavage is 
[02:15:30]  Yeah plunging too  And uh  And it's down  Cleavage  Cleavage  Is that near Dayton  In Cincinnati  I had a stopover  In Cleavage  On the way to  Loss of Legolas  Cleavage  You know  And I've been  Focusing today  And I'm like  Hey I haven't  Mispronounced anything  Yet today  You did one earlier too  Which one?  I don't remember the word  Oh alright  I missed it  Yeah  Alright well  You got swollen glands  Jimmy?  I at least feel like I do  Feeling  I'm not feeling right either  My throat's a little weird  I got a little throat  Like scratchy 
[02:16:00]  And a lot of like  Phlegm  I had that too  I thought it was  In the smoke  Maybe we all have  A bit of the bug  Who knows guys  Knock wood  So anyway  Star Jones  You were saying  Anthony I'm sorry  Let me see the  Star Jones picture  Okay so we got  Star Jones audio  From the red carpet  Oh  Can I see her picture?  Hold it up  Jesus Christ  What is she wearing  In this?  Well she lost weight  And she wants to  Show off some of her  Batte  It's awful  I'm telling you  These fat  Look at this  Unless you could  Lose weight  Until you go out  Of the fat category  Anthony  You shouldn't bother 
[02:16:30]  Why is she wearing that?  Oh what a pig  People are telling her  You look so good  And so slim now  That she's believing it  And she's buying  These clothes  That are meant  For skinny girls  You show it girl  You show it girl  Oof  That is awful  You know what  She should be wearing  A nice rope  Right around her fat neck  And a stool  As shoes  That's what she should  Be wearing  That big fat  Florida Evans neck  She's got going  How is this slob 
[02:17:00]  A major entertainer?  How is she  How does anybody  Listen to her?  All she does  Is go home  And hide her self-hatred  Behind fatty foods  How do you listen  To anything she has to say?  Makes me sick  I am so hoping  That that marriage  Doesn't work  Sounds cruel  But the way she is  And her personality  And the way she's set up  With this  That marriage  To that husband of hers  And made a big  Hoopla of it  Like it was a big  National event  In her own pompous head 
[02:17:30]  It just gears up  It makes people hope  That that marriage fails  Yep  Oh when the announcement  Comes in the paper  Star Jones and hubby split  Yeah  Good  You'll just see her  Back to dirigible size  And it'll happen  When he starts getting  More attention than her  You think?  Oh yeah  She's got a massive ego  It's very obvious  Oh yeah  And it was sponsored  By everything  Massive ego  And a lot of pepperoni pizzas  Pizzas  Hey is there a movie  At this reception? 
[02:18:00]  They should have called her  The elephant  Oh  So  Harold Ramis  Sure is charismatic  On film  I wish he did more acting  He's a great writer  But stop  Her wedding should have been  Sponsored by Robert Blake  O.J. Simpson  Scott Peterson  You get the hint  You fat  Uncharismatic pig  Would have been a tsunami  Off Modesto  If he would have  Dumped her off the boat  Steve is this good?  Is this good? 
[02:18:30]  That's the village  That's the final scene  That you  Oh  Yeah you know  You were talking about  We're going back?  Yeah we'll go backwards again  All right well  We're talking about the village  The village  And you said the final scene  Is really  I didn't say anything  Oh no one of the listeners  Said that they like the final scene  When the parents are crying  When they find out  The retard  Died in the woods  Oh listeners  Suggestions are usually  Really bad  Like they go  Yeah that's good  Or you play  Yeah like how many websites  Do you go to  That the listeners suggest 
[02:19:00]  Dude you gotta go here  It's the funniest thing ever  You click on it  It's like what  What  This  Cindy Adams  Dot com  Awful  Well let's give it a shot  All right  This is when  I wish we had a guy's name  That we could tag to this  And really pound  Let's just give him a name  Douche  Well Douche called in  And said that he laughed  Really hard when  One of the final scenes  Of the movie  When the parents find out  That the retard  And on  Andrew  And on  Adrian Brody  Adrian Brody  Brody  I did that on purpose  Okay  I did it on purpose 
[02:19:30]  I was looking at you  He dies and then  The parents find out  And they're crying  Historically  And this guy thought  It was really funny  Ivy has returned  With medicines from the towns  She was attacked  By a creature  And killed it  We will find him  We will give him 
[02:20:00]  A proper burial  More with William Shatner's  Delivery  Yeah  More  More  More  Tell the others  He was killed  By the creatures  Tell the others  He was killed  By the creatures  Fire phases  Your son has made  Our stories real  Hug  Noah has given us 
[02:20:30]  A chance to continue  This place  This is horrid  Yep  If that is something  We still wish  Is there a train  Coming through here  Anytime soon  Thanks  Douche  That was  You know who it sounds like  Remember that deaf girl  Called up  Her machine  Would talk for her  That's what that sounds like  One of the deaf machines  It has the same delivery  Stunted  One word 
[02:21:00]  Pause at a time  Now whoever  Called up  To suggest that  Call back  Because you're not allowed  To listen to the show  We want to cancel  Your XM subscription  That was awful  Just give us your ID number  Give us your ID  For your radio  So we can send a signal  And blow it up  And we'll refund your money  Because you just wrecked  The show  There was nothing  Entertaining about that  Whatsoever  I thought it was going to be  Them just crying  Uncontrollably  And then that would have been funny  Some whimpering in the background 
[02:21:30]  And some bad acting  Horrendous  I'm sorry  We have to stop the show  For that  Stupid listener  I'm actually glad  We played more of that though  Just so the guy in Nebraska  Can enjoy more of his new  Favorite film  I'll tell you  Thank God  There was like  The conversation we had  About it before  With the bad acting  Because that was another example  So at least it wasn't  A complete and total  Waste of time  But to call in and say  It's great at the end  When they find out  He's dead  Why?  You jackass  You're sitting out there 
[02:22:00]  Right now  Listening to the show  Even though you don't want  To fess up to who you are  You know who you are  You're an ass  Douche  Alright we got audio  Of Star Jones  On the red carpet  I want to get to  The Jonah Melissa  Stuff  I think that is  Even worse  Let's listen to  How Star Jones  Handled Dennis Leary  Let me tell you  Who I am with  A great husband  And wife team  This is Dennis  And why did I just  Do that  My brain just went  Into a brain fart  You know  No I  These people are 
[02:22:30]  In my ear  And I'm trying to say  Dennis Leary  And Ann Limbeck  But of course  I was thinking  About something else  Like how great  You look right there  Oh boy  You too  Yeah I'm fabulous  No I gotta tell you  Ann I'm  See they're all gonna tell  Star Jones how fabulous  Every single person  You look fabulous  You look fat-bulous  You think she looks fabulous  Why don't you gain 50 pounds  Yeah there you go  And then you can look fabulous  So you can look just as fabulous  As Star Jones  She had forgotten  Dennis Leary's name 
[02:23:00]  Yes she did  And then the people  In her ear  Had to tell her  And she tried to cover it  And blame it on the people  In her ear  Right  I'm trying to say  Hi to Dennis Leary  Leary and there's people  In my ear  My band started playing  The wrong song  And I did the  Herky jerky dance  On the stage  Oh Star  You look so much better  Than that time  You looked in the train window  At Jessica Lange  Oh my god  Let's continue  I was sitting there  Kind of in dress envy

[02:36:30]  Spreading across America  I gotta tell you man  The Today Show is celebrating  Martin Luther King Day  In a very unusual way  You wanna explain Anthony?  I don't even know what the hell he's doing  But  I think they're doing a fear factor thing  They had Al Roker  On some kind of a crane  He was on the end of a cable  Swinging back and forth  Throwing fish at a woman  And she was trying to catch it in a barrel  And she was trying to catch it in a bucket  That's a hell of a way to celebrate MLK Day  To have Al Roker swinging 
[02:37:00]  Throwing fish at a woman  What the hell is that?  There he is  They're letting him down now  Look at him go  It is absolutely horrific  I know  Or is that Jill Rappaport  Old horse face Jill Rappaport  Oh she really is  A horse face ass  Look at Al Roker  Watch Al  You may spook her  No pun  Al is just swinging  From a crane  What's that sign?  Winked at a white lady 
[02:37:30]  Oh wow  Are you insane?  Oh my god  No  Can you please pot up the TV  So we can listen to the audio  Holy Jesus  Right here is the audio  You are horrible  Well I'm not saying I agree with it  But I'm saying that is an unfortunate reality  Anthony Al Roker is swinging from a crane  Yeah I know  They just jury rigged the TV  So we can listen to what's going on 
[02:38:00]  George  George  George  George of the jungle  Strong as he can be  Watch out for that tree  Hey that's not it  I guess they were playing that music  When he was doing that  No that's not it  It's odd  That's for the next segment  When we talk about old cartoons  Old cartoons  Huh  Getting a lot of things confused today  That one didn't work  That Joe Rappaport really is atrocious 
[02:38:30]  Isn't she?  Let's say hi to Mark Patrick  Hey Mark  Hey just a reminder  This Martin Luther King Day  No trash pickup today  And your bank's going to be closed  And no mail pickup  Right  For delivery  So hey good morning to you  Good morning to you Mark  Hi  Is there anything better than watching local newscasts  On days like today  Just so they remind every dumbass in the world  That there's no bank  Open today  Yeah I gotta remind you 
[02:39:00]  Just in case you were on your way  Make a deposit on Martin Luther King Day  And you get there  And all of a sudden  Hey gosh  Don't forget coming up on April 15th  It's my understanding  This is the last day you can file your tax return  Yeah they say  So we're going to be live  Local and late breaking  There at 11 o'clock  At the post office  Is all the prognosticators  Is that what they call them?  No I believe  Steve  That would be  Not  That would be people  That predict things 
[02:39:30]  Well whatever it is  Let's throw it back to you  But we're going to be live  We're going to be live  At the post office  Every single year  You're right  What you don't know  About your taxes  Could kill you  Right  Coming up at 11  Although having Al Roker's swing on the Today Show is fresh  Yeah that is  I've never seen that before  I've never seen that to celebrate the divisional playoffs  What Al Jolson's not available on Martin Luther King  I know right  Unbelievable  Yeah well 
[02:40:00]  Hey what did you think about the games?  How was his prediction?  Do we have them?  I don't think we have them  Because you know  We didn't write that down?  I was three for four  I missed New England, Indiana  Alright well why don't we start with the Who Cares game  Atlanta and St. Louis  Yeah  If it weren't for the Mike Martz cutaways  I don't know that anything would be worth watching in that  Yeah it's just  I don't know  Who won that?  Who cares?  I don't even know  Atlanta won that  Atlanta beat St. Louis 47-17 
[02:40:30]  47-17  You really don't have much on that game right?  It's the Who Cares game  All they did was show that they had a running game  That a lot of people maybe weren't aware of  Now everybody's buying into that  But see everybody is also forgetting St. Louis has no defense  So I don't know that they're going to be able to go in and do that at Philadelphia next weekend  Yeah I think Philadelphia's going to the Super Bowl my friend  Yeah I think so  I think we've got an East Coast matchup  I don't think it will be interest state 
[02:41:00]  I think it will be New England and Philly  That would be great  Alright well let's get into it  My Jets  My Jets  Because you know I'm on the team  I just didn't get in there  Just didn't get in there Saturday  Were you ready to throw things through the TV for a couple of different reasons?  Oh  It was just ridiculous  How do you miss those field goals if you're an NFL kicker?  Well yeah that's your whole job  You just sit there on the sideline waiting to come in to do 
[02:41:30]  You know to make that  That's it  Make that kick  I have this theory though man  I mean that guy  What's his name again?  The guy that missed the kick?  The guy that missed the kick?  The guy that missed the kick?  Huh?  Matt Bryan  Yeah Matt Bryan  We explained earlier that we're like  This is how sports should be  Should be done on the radio  Like you know it's just guys that kind of get the names wrong  Yeah and we're like  You know that guy  That guy  What was his name back then?  I think he played for  In other words do it on the radio  The way Dick Enberg and Dan Dilldorf were doing it 
[02:42:00]  Yeah exactly  Hang on you want to talk to Dan?  Yeah let's talk to Dan  It's a prop comic  I have the world's largest Rolodex  Whenever we need to talk to somebody we can always  Save me at Dilldorf  That's it huh?  Is this opening Anthony?  Yeah what's up Dan?  I heard you Sissy boys  Complaining about what was going on out there  Complaining about the New York football Jets 
[02:42:30]  Cup check  They obviously just didn't have what they needed in that one  You fellas wearing your cups this morning  I didn't hear you check them  Thanks Dan  Cup check  Oh now Dan's got on his metal cup  Alright well  Yeah alright 
[02:43:00]  So uh  So that my theory was that  What's his name there  Was on the sideline  You know  Practicing his kicks  Because he knows  He knew he was going in there  Daryl Stingley  Oh wow  Nice  And uh  And he had that little  Stupid tripod thing  So he was on the sideline  By himself  Just kind of  Kind of kicking by himself  And uh  I don't know  I don't think he felt like he was  Part of the team  You know  Like uh  The Steelers  When that guy's on the sideline  Uh kicking 
[02:43:30]  He has a guy that actually  Holds the ball for him  And he could  Give him words of encouragement  And it just seemed like it  It made more sense  Instead of having this  Lonely field goal kicker  On the sideline  With his little tripod  A guy like Brian has been  With about 10 different teams  Yeah  So guys know  Vagabonds like that  So they don't bother  Getting to know him  It's just like the kicker  You know  Right  Well  In a practice  They never hang out  I mean they just go  To their own little area  With the punter  It's almost like  Um  They're not even really  Part of the team 
[02:44:00]  Are they  An alternative lifestyle club  Among NFL guys  Sure  You gotta imagine  Like the linebackers  And the running back  I mean  Pretty much every other  Member of a football team  Just doesn't even think  That what they do  Is important  No  And that's  That's what's great  When somebody like  Vanderjatt  Mouths off  About the other team  During the course of a week  His team  Has to really adore that  Yeah  Cause he just  He just goes in  Every once in a while  And kicks  That's it  And then  He's not in the trenches  Getting his ass kicked 
[02:44:30]  Yeah  Doug Bryant  Which is a nice touch  That's it  Doug Bryant  Doug Bryant  Yeah  Oh that's where  We're getting at  Yeah  Alright so  Well Ant and I  Were saying earlier  You know  He misses the first one  And then obviously  You know he's gonna  Overkick the second one  And that's why  He pulled it  Well he  The amazing thing  You could tell  He was getting  That it was getting  To him  Because  He's over on the  Sideline  And  The camera's there  And did you hear  He said go away  Uh oh  That ain't good  Now if you're noticing 
[02:45:00]  The camera  When you're warming up  With your little  Tripod holder  Yeah  Not good  Not good right  Yeah you're  You're not in the game  Yeah we figured  His second kick  Was pretty similar  To the first  And he knew  He came up short  On the first  So he really figured  Nah I gotta  I gotta really  Boot this thing  And uh  When you do that  It's over Johnny  Yeah see this is  Regular guy speaking sports  That's all we think it was  He just  He just  He just  He just  We look deep  Into the  Psychological  He just 
[02:45:30]  He just  Overcompensated  So then you got  The Eagles  Kicking Minnesota's  Ass  27-14  That  That was less than  The only thing  Astonishing in that  Again was  Was Randy Moss  And  His hair  Yeah  I just  I still cannot  Get over his hair  Yeah his  Huge afro  It is amazing  He keeps all  Existing records  There was a small  Cuban family  Found living in it  After the game  Yeah why  Is the afro  Coming back 
[02:46:00]  Of all the things  That come back  Having these guys  Watched old  ABA footage  There's no reason  To bring the afro back  But it's slowly  But surely  Coming back  Into sports  And why is it  Why is it  Every year  That the disgusting  Vikings  Start off strong  And then just  Die  They die  Every year  They were 6-0  A year ago  Didn't get in the playoffs  They really  Are just an  Awful  Organization  I think  Red McCombs  Really wants 
[02:46:30]  He is actually  He's their owner  I think he's  Actually the guy  That's the owner  Of  I think it's  The natural  Where the owner  Wants the team  To lose  Why  So that he can  You know  So that he can  Move the team  Oh okay  I think it's in that  It's the theme  Of a couple  Of different movies  I know it's  I believe it's  In Major League  As well  Major League  Yes  The owner  Of the Cleveland  Indians  Wants the team  To do really  Badly  So she can  Move the team  And it's 
[02:47:00]  That kind of  That old  Theory  But I think  That's the deal  With Red McCombs  He really  Doesn't want  Them to succeed  So he can  Move them  To LA  So they don't  Get a stadium  Beyond Minnesota  And he  Gets the big bucks  To move out  To the west coast  I think that's  I think that's  What's going on  There  It's the only  Explanation  As to why  Mike Tice  Could possibly  Be coming back  As coach  And why would  LA get another  Football team  That whole  Stupid city  Has done nothing  But lose teams  They don't deserve  A team  They're not 
[02:47:30]  Football fans  They're a bunch  Of west coast  Fairies  And all they do  I mean the Rams  Came there  I mean they lost  The Raiders  They just stink  You know if the  Vikings move  That's going to be  What they're called  The west coast  Fairies  Did you know that  Good name  They've already  Got them in the  NFC central division  The west coast  Fairies  And the green  Bay packers  A lot of  Similarities here  Dan Dilldorf  That's  Yeah  Nobody cares 
[02:48:00]  In LA  You guys have  Spent time out  There  Nobody cares  About sports  Out there  They don't care  About anything  Out there  All they care  About  You know  What we were  Seeing last  Night on the  Golden Globes  Yeah  Alright  But this would  Give Robin  Williams a new  Opportunity  Wouldn't it  Football  Alright  You can make  Props out of it  Take two  Footballs  Look I put them  Under my  My shirt  And I'm making  Breasts  Oh  Oh Robin  Look  Look  A helmet  What's that  Good for  I could put it  On my head  And use it  As a helmet  I'm a genius  But that's 
[02:48:30]  What everyone  Does with it  Yes but  When I do it  It's hysterically  Funny  Welcome to  Welcome to  Inside the  Actors  Studio  Isn't that  Awful  Just grab  Everything  To make  A prop  No  He's very  Nice to me  I know  He's very  Nice to you  Jimmy  And shut up  I know  He's going to  Do something  For you  Someday  So you've  Got to be  Nice to him  Everybody  Knows that  You're not  Making fun  Of Robin  Williams  It's  Anthony  I like  Him  We're  Laughing  With him  Alright  And finally  The Pats  And the  Colts  Have they  Played  Yeah well  A lot of  People saying  That this  Was a 
[02:49:00]  Surprise win  For the  Patriots  Surprise  Well it  Was  Well the  Colts  Were heavily  If you  Listen to  People who  Thought they  Knew  What they  Were talking  About  Like me  Yes you  Actually  Picked the  Colts  Yes  If you  Actually  Thought  That you  Knew  What you  Were talking  About  Like me  And about  Everybody  Else  On television  That was  Talking  About this  Game  Really  Thought that  The Colts  Had arrived  As a  Football  Team  And they  Proved  All of  Us  Incorrect  Yesterday  Because the  Patriots  Are still  When it 
[02:49:30]  Comes down  To it  Probably  The best  Team  In the  NFL  Pretty  Frightening  When they  Really need  To play  Football  And when it  Comes down  To playing  Football  They're the  Most physical  Team  They're the  Smartest  Team  And I  Think  By far  The most  Well coached  Team  Which is  Kind of  Amazing  Because Bill  Belichick  Has the  Personality  Of a  Wart  He  Really  Does  He  Shows  No emotion  Ever  Which  You know  It's  Amazing  Because when  He first  Became a  Head Coach  In Cleveland  That was 
[02:50:00]  A huge  Problem  And I  Don't know  If he's  Learned from  That experience  Or what  But when  He  When the  Patriots  Actually fought  The Jets  And gave up  Draft choices  So that they  Could get this  Guy to be  Their head  Coach  I thought  You know  How stupid  Are you  People  And yet  It's  Proven to  Be  One of  The  Great  Hires  Of  All  Time  Which  Is  Pretty  Amazing  What  About  I'm a  Cowboy  Fan  And  What about  The rumors  That next  Year  I'm sorry  Yeah  I  I  Realized  It's  Not  Going to  Be  Good  For  Quarterback 
[02:50:30]  Because  They  Said  That  Currently  Testaverde  Is  Working  In  A  Massage  Parlor  Giving  Happy  Endings  And  He  Threw  An  Interception  Well  You know  It's  My  Understanding  Though  That  President  Bush  Is  Called  Upon  Van  Head  Over  To  Iraq  To  Overthrow  Some  Of  The  Gorillas  And  Hello  Again  Everybody  So  Did  Manning  Choke  Or  What  Yeah  Yeah 
[02:51:00]  Pretty  Much  Right  He  Just  Bill  Belichick  Again  He  Choked  Like  No  One  Else  I  Mean  All  Of  Sudden  A  Team  That  Did  Nothing  But  Throw  The  Ball  Down  Field  All  Year  Long  Is  Throwing  Dink  Passes  And  Trying  To  Run  Right  Right  Right  Right  And  I  Don't  Know  How  Much  The  Weather  Was  A  Factor  In  That  But  Could  You  Please  Call  them  Asian  Passes  We  Don't  Really  Like  The  Racial  What  What  Did  He  Said  Dink  Passes  And  You  Know  The  Proper  Term  Is  Asian  Passes 
[02:51:30]  Who  Goes  To  The  Super  Bowl  Mark  I  Just  Think  It's  New  England  And  Philadelphia  You  Said  That  Earlier  Very  Good  Although  If  I  Were  Smart  Like  Dan  Marino  I  Would  Make  Different  Picks  On  Every  Show  I'm  On  He  Picks  The  Colts  On  Inside  The  NFL  And  On  Sunday  I  Like  New  England  He  Really  He  He's  Done 
[02:52:00]  That  For  Three  Years  It's  Like  Dan  There  Are  People  That  Watch  Both  Shows  That's  Hilarious  Do  You  Do  A  Dan  Marino  Impression  Man  I  Wish  I  Did  I  Get  Laid  More  Huh  Yeah  All  Right  Mark  Thank  You  So  Much  Thank  You  Boys  We  Gotta  Get  Back  To  The  Golden  Globes  Audio  Here  We  Got  Joan  And  Melissa  Audio  By  The  Way  Do  You  Think  Joan  Had  Enough  New  Poison

[03:14:00]  C-O-N-A virus spreading across America.  Thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  We got Brian from Fox & Friends.  Yeah.  Killmead, I guess.  I always have a...  I think that's his last name, right?  Yeah.  He's coming in to us.  Brian.  Hey, yeah.  We know you.  What's up, buddy?  How you doing, man?  I'm sorry, man.  Nice to see you.  What's up?  I'll walk over.  Of course, Jimmy.  Yes, we were saying hello, too.  And Brian's here to promote his new book, The Games Do Count.  Ah. 
[03:14:30]  You just finished with Fox & Friends and came running over here?  I'm freezing.  My goodness.  What the heck's going on?  It's cold out.  Yeah.  It's called winter, Brian.  We have the same hours.  Yeah.  We have the same exact hours.  Actually, Ben came in here and said that you get up at 2.30 in the morning, though.  Because I live in Massapequa.  We have all this studying to do in the morning.  And my problem is I can't do much at night because I have this thing called children.  So I've got to really do all the studying when they're asleep.  What time do you go to bed?  I go to bed around 10-ish.  10?  Yeah, but I'm not like you guys.  You guys have to go out at night to make appearances. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah, right.  No one really wants me to go out at night.  So for you guys, you've got to go out.  Not really, though, but you must take a nap during the day.  You know, on the way home for 45 minutes, about 20 minutes, Long Island Railroad, I'll  go to sleep.  So you're living your life with only like five hours sleep a day?  That's what I'm saying.  Oh, man.  Dude, we're pussies, man.  I know.  Because we get here just before five, and we prep for an hour, and some days it shows. 
[03:15:30]  And as soon as 10.30 hits, we're out, and I take my nap.  And I go to bed around 9 o'clock every night.  You do not.  I go to bed at 9 o'clock.  Go to bed at 9.  Yeah, the shock jocks go to bed early.  Did you guys ever get used to normal life, go sleeping until 9 during that period of exile?  No, no.  During that time, my sleep schedule, it changed like every month or so.  All of a sudden, I'd ooze into being nocturnal.  Like you tack an hour on and take an hour off the back end of it every day. 
[03:16:00]  You're going to sleep maybe an hour later, waking up an hour later.  And then before you know it, you're getting up at 5 in the morning, or you're getting up at noon.  Right.  You know, it's just, you kind of, I had nowhere to be, no obligation, so screw it.  That's really strange to have no responsibility.  But you did, though.  What did you do?  Did you discipline yourself?  Did you put your schedule, like a 9 to 11 library?  11 to 12 gymnastics?  Yeah.  I actually, not even close.  I actually tried.  I mean, I started going to the gym again, and you've got to try to do something, or it just gets nuts. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  You know?  It was crazy.  And then once we got the gig here, it was, you know, getting up early, which we never did when we were doing radio.  We've been afternoon drive.  We didn't do mornings.  I'm trying to remember if Fox & Friends trashed us, or if they were nice to us.  No, we were nice to you, and we had you on.  No, I remember being on there.  It was great.  We did a phone-on or something, right?  Yeah.  We had no ratings back then.  Yeah, right.  In the very beginning, no one was watching.  So I was like, yeah, have Opie and Anthony on.  I noticed we haven't been asked back since. 
[03:17:00]  That's all right.  Well, you know, Sean Hannity had the market cornered on you guys.  You know, you're going to come back.  You're going to have exclusive with Sean Hannity, the monster.  I was really surprised that we got along with him.  I was just surprised.  Sean's a cool guy, man.  No, we liked him a lot.  I got no problem with Sean Hannity.  But he does a very different type of radio show.  I don't want to get you guys emotional, but I brought over calendars, because they're  free for us.  Oh, what do you got?  This has basically almost every day of the year.  Fox and Friends.  There's a calendar.  Now, we don't get...  This just goes short.  I don't get a dime off this.  Do you see that?  We went into a hangar, an all-white hangar, and sat on an old car, and they're selling 
[03:17:30]  it for $20.  Are you kidding?  Yeah.  So I brought them over for free.  You don't get any money for this?  Not a thing.  They're selling the calendars.  Right.  Well, that's some marketing over there at Fox.  That's fantastic.  It's $20.  That is really something.  Wow, look at you guys overacting in the car.  Whoa, hey, we're going a little too fast.  Yeah, but the thing is, my background is...  You see...  We're going a little too fast.  Whoa.  You see February.  Whoa, hey, hey, there's a hot dog vendor in the row.  Watch out.  Whoa.  Now point like there's something you're ready to run over. 
[03:18:00]  You guys also came up in the print model.  Is that correct?  Before radio?  What?  Were you guys doing print work?  No.  Yeah.  Obviously not.  Yeah.  Oh, look at you playing the guitar.  That's good.  I'm not really sure what I'm doing.  Guys, it's a gift.  You should just say thank you.  No, we're going to look through everything.  You're not supposed to peruse it and shred it on the air.  We goof on everything, though.  That's great.  Yeah, I will hang this up in my office.  Can I look at it?  I didn't get one, but I'll just look.  Jim, I'm sorry.  I forgot you were here. 
[03:18:30]  That's right.  I apologize.  I like Edie, by the way.  I remember watching her, and she definitely defended us.  I liked Edie.  She was all right.  Very cute, too.  Who bashed us really good?  Shep.  Yeah.  Who bashed us?  Shepard Smith.  Shepard did?  Yeah.  In what?  Studio B?  Yeah.  Oh, he bashed us bad when we got the boot.  He was using words like idiots, nitwits, I think he called us.  Really?  Oh, those two nitwits, Opie and Anthony.  Like, oh, nitwits, stop.  That's not the Shep I know. 
[03:19:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Something tells me it is exactly the Shep you know.  I was trolling around thesmokinggun.com the other day, and I'm clicking on mugshots,  and Shep's popped up, and I'm like, ah, okay.  That's good enough.  Shepard, did you ever see Shep's mugshot?  You know what?  We don't show it a lot at Fox News.  No?  You know, it doesn't really, there's certain blocks that come up, and that's where the  blocks, you know, and at home I'm so tired, I don't really log on at home.  Of course, that's understandable.  You know what I mean?  So why is there a mugshot of Shepard? 
[03:19:30]  Shep got into some trouble at a location, they were doing a story a while back, I think  it was Florida?  Yeah, some psycho reporter didn't want him parking where he was going to repark, and he insisted  on parking there, and I think he...  So she stood in the parking spot, and he kind of rolled up and nudged her with his bumper,  and...  Hey, I did that once.  He and Opie did the same thing.  And they arrested him for, you know, hitting the woman.  I don't know what happened to it.  I didn't get...  Everything's dropped, everything's dropped, and the woman's no longer in the business.  Really?  I didn't get arrested. 
[03:20:00]  This animal just beat up my car instead.  Yeah.  Really?  Opie did the same thing.  I pulled into a crosswalk a little bit.  The light was green for us, but there was a lot of traffic, and you know how the pedestrians  start crossing in front of you if you can't move?  Yeah, and they like to stroll a little slower.  Then traffic cleared up.  The light is still green for us, but for some reason, pedestrians, they keep crossing.  So Opie goes to move, and this guy...  I think he's moving up, just showing who's boss.  This guy kind of looked at Opie like, hey, I'm walking here, kind of thing, and then  we're looking, going, no, the light's green.  Keep your ass back up on the sidewalk.  You're trying to get over the 59th Street Bridge. 
[03:20:30]  You know how those lights are.  You want to get through.  You got to be bold.  Got to move.  Right.  And then the guy wouldn't move from in front of the vehicle, so Opie edges up and gave  him a little tap with the bumper on his thigh.  So?  Well, so the guy walks over to my side, because I'm the passenger, and gave a right hook to his  side view mirror that knocked it completely off the vehicle.  Really?  He was just hanging from the electrical cords.  Oh, yeah.  My fists moved so quickly, you couldn't even see me throw the lock down on the door, so  he could open it and get me. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, we were so brave after he attacked my car.  We were like, hey, I guess I deserved it.  Nothing makes you feel like more of a wuss than hearing through the closed window, what  are you going to come out here and do something about it?  I'm like, what?  I can't really hear you.  At least there are no girls in the car, so you still have your reputation, except for  you are telling anyone.  I know, but they didn't see it.  If there were girls in the car, how embarrassing is that?  No, poopsie.  Yeah.  I don't want you to get hurt.  You use the old psychology, hey, man, I don't want to go to jail. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah, there you go.  You're going to get arrested.  It's the city.  You don't know what kind of nuts these are.  You might have a gun, for God's sake.  I looked at it and they're like, eh, the damage doesn't look that bad.  And I'm a hothead, but this guy would have killed me, so I'm like, eh.  Can I say what surprised me?  You have so many people that follow you and so many hangers on.  You have yes men and you have publicist and managers.  Don't you have somebody that would go fight for you?  Now we do.  Club soda Kenny.  Club soda Kenny.  He's big and stupid.  But back then, it was just me and Opie carpooling in on a daily basis.  Oh, from Long Island. 
[03:22:00]  And then Opie didn't fix the mirror.  And, you know, it's one of those newer mirrors that you could adjust from inside the car,  so it's connected with a cable.  It hung by that cable, making this perfectly round, compass-like scratch on the side of  his car.  Well, you never fixed it.  It was like, I don't know.  Honestly, it was about six months later I finally got it fixed.  Well, sorry to bring you there, guys.  It destroyed my car.  It's good memories.  It destroyed my car.  The commute in from Long Island.  You take the train, though?  Is that a pain in you?  No, the way in, they send a car on the way back. 
[03:22:30]  I'm better off on the train if it's around traffic time because you're just sitting in  traffic time and you're not off.  Because I drive in early.  I drive in like 4.30 in the morning.  Great neck.  All right.  So if I have them running late, could I drop to your house and then go with you?  If I see you hitching on the expressway or something, I'll pick you up.  Oh, that's the TV guy.  I'm just amazed that a big TV star like you, you're taking the train.  That amazes me.  On the way home.  Do you get recognized?  Get bothered a lot.  Sometimes people recognize you, but you know you're getting home.  One time, I drove home around Christmas time, two and a half hours. 
[03:23:00]  You can't be doing that.  You've got to move closer to the city, I'm thinking.  So you can sleep.  You've got to hit the pedestrian.  I know.  Obviously.  You get home quickly.  So before we get into the book, I want to ask you, what's the big story today?  What were you guys talking about?  The number one story, Katie Couric at CBS.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  But the number one has to be the inauguration and what they're doing.  That's big.  Security?  And then number two is Iraq.  Were there any alerts during your Fox and Friends?  No.  Fox News Alert.  Guys, for now on, I'm going to call you directly to beat the alerts. 
[03:23:30]  Oh, good.  So you're going to be ahead of the news.  We'll get it first.  We'll have an Opie and Anthony alert that there's going to be a Fox News alert.  That would be fantastic for us.  Yeah, the number one story is the elections.  And I love this.  You know, our troops are kicking ass over there.  They're doing fantastic.  They're capturing 50 people.  One guy gets shot.  There was like a first day on the job of an Iraqi policeman.  And that's the headlines.  It's like we're working against our own country.  Well, it's very hard to convince the people that anything good is happening over there.  It really is.  Because, you know, you're hearing soldiers dying. 
[03:24:00]  That's all we're hearing.  Because that's the bottom line.  But do you know soldiers are getting so angry when they watch the press?  So they pull us aside.  They email us and say, guys, you're giving the wrong picture.  Thanks for the sympathy.  But you're hurting our cause.  Really?  Yeah.  I mean, we should not be airing insurgent video of a Bradley blowing up.  Because that means a photographer had to be in with the insurgent to show the Bradley blowing up.  Whose side are we on?  Who do you want to win this?  I saw 60 Minutes last night.  They had a whole segment on a guy that's riding along with some of the troops. 
[03:24:30]  And they had talked to a guy in the press that was embedded with the insurgents.  And he had pictures of them doing the roadside bombs and video.  But that was part of the enemy press.  Yeah, I know.  That wasn't one of our guys.  You just want to smack them.  I get sick of hearing about the bias in our media.  When you look at those scumbags at Al Jazeera, and they won't show any of that Margaret Hassan video because they knew it would hurt the insurgents' cause.  They wouldn't vote.  Yeah.  I mean, I get tired of hearing about the bias in the American media when Al Jazeera is actively working to further the cause of the insurgents. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah.  Sickening.  I don't know.  Well, Fox, you've got to give you guys the credit.  I like the flag waving.  We're pro-American.  There's a lot of flag waving over there.  Well, you guys take a lot of heat for it.  You really do.  It's seen as not being unbiased, and you're kind of rah-rah for the troops instead of really reporting accurately.  It's more slanted towards supporting the president. 
[03:25:30]  I think pro-troops unabashedly pro-troops.  I don't think there's any reason to leave with Abu Ghraib scandal every single day like the New York Times is.  And when it goes away, they basically just change subjects.  I mean, if you wanted to get the correct headline, Afghanistan, now it's the Taliban putting down their guns and coming in.  They're letting them out.  There's now semi-democracy in a place that hasn't had it ever.  These guys are just gone.  They don't exist anymore.  That story is no longer cool to certain areas of the media. 
[03:26:00]  As far as the president goes, you guys, everyone could debate that back and forth.  Oh, you're too nice.  You're too mean.  Whatever.  But the troops, I say, I'm going to Fort Riley tomorrow to address the troops.  They're going back for the second time.  And I stayed with these guys in Kuwait for two weeks.  And now most of them are going back again.  And I'll be honest with you.  I'm all for them.  I can't wait to hear their message.  And a lot of them are a little aggravated because they come home and they're going, wait a second.  This is not what's happening.  Yeah, it's bad when three Marines die and three Army guys die.  But do you know we captured 50?  Do you know 80% of that country is going to vote? 
[03:26:30]  Do you know that this is, you know, a lot of stuff has been surprises.  But for the most part, they're walking around.  People like them.  There's some idiots out there who just want to blow things up.  So that's what's getting the attention, though.  And that's also, I don't know, what do you think about the elections?  This could be very, very...  They're not even telling the people where they can vote.  I know.  Until the last minute.  Until the last minute because it's security concerns.  I mean, it seems to me like this would be a perfect opportunity for these scumbags to really make some noise, you know? 
[03:27:00]  It's going to happen.  You're going to hear it.  You're going to hear what happened.  You're going to hear what happened in the Anbar province.  You're going to hear what happened in Fallujah.  Not Fallujah anymore.  That's cleaned out.  You're going to hear what happened in Mosul, let's say.  But all of a sudden, you're going to say to yourself, why is Najaf quiet?  Why is Basra quiet?  What is happening down south in all these areas?  In 14 of the country, in 14 of the provinces slash states, it went pretty good.  That's a mess, the Sunni area.  But who are these guys?  These are brutal thugs that would be murdering people anyway.  Yeah.  Straighten it out. 
[03:27:30]  It's just a power grab they're going for.  It's not like they're sincerely, you know, there's just a good chance with chaos for them  to all grab for a piece of the pie.  That's what they're doing.  They're not freedom fighters.  They're just scumbags who want to run the show.  So they're grabbing for it.  I think the real story is, where is the rest of the world?  These are the bad guys against the good guys, and they're mad at us because they're really  supporting the insurgency by not helping us out, by not giving us 50,000 troops.  You're saying democracy is overrated.  No, they will never help George Bush at this point. 
[03:28:00]  They will never.  It would make them look like they're backing down from their position, which was don't  go in there in the first place.  So you'll never get the rest of the world's help.  I think you're right.  But then again, the rest of the world doesn't get the credit then either.  They'll try to take it in time.  You know, look how many people jumped on taking credit after World War II.  Have I taken down this entire room?  Do you guys start?  Are you sure?  We go.  We get a weird reputation.  We like to talk serious every once in a while.  All right.  We'll bring on a slut in a little while. 
[03:28:30]  Don't worry about it.  You promise?  Because I was saying we need a girl in here to test out our new shades.  Remember, every time we had a girl in here that was doing anything a little lewd, we  would have to tape up newspapers on the windows.  Well, we've gotten new shades that come down the window.  And guess what newspaper we use?  We use the New York Times.  New York Times.  We read the Post, the Daily News, Newsday, but the New York Times is...  It stays pristine all day.  It's perfect and reserved for us to cover up the windows.  Did you guys talk...  I know you had to talk about this.  Wait, it's a weekend story.  We have this bomb. 
[03:29:00]  Oh, the gay bomb?  Did you talk about the gay bomb?  Is that true?  Did you guys hit on that at all?  Well, they talked on the weekend a little bit.  Honestly, this is totally true.  Well, they said what you do is you actually have to dye the top of it blonde.  One of our producers decided to dye his hair blonde.  Oh, is that true?  So you're into the joke.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I saw this over the weekend, too.  I'm like, ah, this is one of those weekly world news stories.  Ha, ha, ha.  But then now it's getting reported by everyone that the Pentagon sexes up the battle, but 
[03:29:30]  gay bomb goes bust in the lab.  They were trying to come up with a gay bomb?  To make the soldiers be attracted to each other, and evidently homosexuality would destroy  the morale...  Right.  ...amongst the men.  You know, they'd get all snippy with each other about relationships that are going on,  little cliques, and guy-guy relationships.  Clothing, perhaps, would come into play.  Here's some bullet points.  The gay bomb, a Pentagon spokesman confirmed yesterday, was a real proposal, an idea floated  by Air Force researchers to render enemy troops ineffective by rendering them homosexual. 
[03:30:00]  How do you...  This can't be true.  Absolutely not.  With my gay bomb, I rule the world.  Someone yells incoming and half of them drop to their knees.  See, there's our...  There he is right there.  He decided to dye his hair blonde.  See, there you go.  There he is.  I think you look great.  He was hit by a gay bomb on the way in.  Oh, by the way, that's the wrong guy.  How do you arm it?  All the kids are doing...  It just doesn't seem true. 
[03:30:30]  In 94, they were working on this.  Yeah, it says, chemicals that affect human behavior so that discipline and morale in enemy  units is adversely affected.  One distaste...  Distasteful, sorry.  But completely non-lethal example would be strong aphrodisiacs, especially if the chemical  also caused homosexual behavior.  It is unclear what substance would jack up the sex drive and break down the inhibitions  of normally heterosexual troops.  It's fine.  They just have nowhere to go with that. 
[03:31:00]  No.  But to me, I think that if you became gay, you were a better fighter because you want to  protect your lover.  Right.  You're not going to kill him.  I'm more...  The bond would only grow.  True, but they do get snippy.  They do.  They certainly do.  At least the foxhole would be nice and neat.  What the hell is that?  A butt plug in your footlocker!  So it was an idea and it didn't go any further, is what they're basically saying.  Yeah, well that sounds like an idea that...  It sounds like a joke idea. 
[03:31:30]  The AP's been caught, Reuters have been caught, this has been everywhere.  It's one of those things that I'm sure the gay community will jump on and you can't make  people.  You can't turn someone gay with some chemical you could drop in a bomb, can you?  That that I know of.  Can you?  A couple other things.  Let's go to the phones and then we'll talk about the book here.  John in Jersey.  John?  Yeah, on the front page of the news, Iran is next.  Now what's the deal with them, man?  It's like, why is it now, first Iraq and Iran, what's next, you know? 
[03:32:00]  Seymour Hershey's got that story in the New Yorker that says we already got commandos there.  Well that would make sense.  We're just kind of spying on them, right?  Yeah.  Kind of checking them out.  I like the idea that there's covert things going on around the world.  There better be!  Absolutely.  But for some reason, some people believe we should know everything that's going on and  there should be this complete accountability of these secretive agencies, which I don't  believe.  That's how we got through the Cold War.  It was agencies going into these places, doing the spying, without the public knowing. 
[03:32:30]  Right.  That's okay.  I don't like them coming into, you know, people's houses here.  You know, that should be.  But if they're in some South American country, over there in the Middle East, checking out  these bad guys, go to them.  But here's my problem.  I mean, Seymour Hershey, for one thing, half the stuff he says is true, you don't know  what half.  And number two is, thanks guys, for telling Iran to start looking around for that suspicious  guy, you know, in the GQ haircut that we never thought belonged to the neighborhood  to begin with.  It's a little treasonous.  Yes.  Yeah.  All right.  A couple more calls.  Zach from Arizona.  Zach, what's up? 
[03:33:00]  Oh, not too much.  What's going on for you guys?  Hurry up.  We're on with Brian.  We're flowing here.  Oh, okay.  I also heard on the news about another bomb they're going to do.  It makes you have really bad breath.  They're going to detect insurgents with their bad breath.  So how long have you lived in Munaki?  That's pretty...  Sorry you had to deal with that, Brian.  No, it's okay.  One more, and then we'll get listeners to think they have this, you know, sense of humor.  Ray from Jersey. 
[03:33:30]  What's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Listen, the time that I actually got to like Brian was when he tore up that C-bone, Janine  Garofalo.  Oh, nice.  He tore her to shreds.  Did you really on the show?  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  He tore...  That's when I started to love him.  He's great.  If cancer has any place on this earth, it's going to climb inside of her womb and lay a  nice little seed.  Oh, I heard...  Wow.  I heard she got ripped on Fox.  I didn't know that was you.  Good job.  I heard she got destroyed.  We don't...  Well, we didn't mean to rip her.  She just went nuts when I just started asking her what validated some of these opinions, 
[03:34:00]  and she went crazy because she had an attitude walking into Fox.  Just knowing the reputation Fox has, she walked in there completely on the defensive.  She's going to be offensive.  So she comes in there with a battle plan and everything.  Didn't matter what you said.  You saw this?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Isn't it good to see a comedian get to be somewhere by being a comedian and then forget  to be funny with their opinions?  Hey, look, sweetheart.  If you don't have the gift, get married and cook dinner for a man. 
[03:34:30]  Any dummy can spout their opinions.  You're a comic.  You've earned the right to spout your opinion by being funny.  If you can't tie the two together, if you're not talented enough to do that, then get out  of the business.  Some people forget that.  I mean, is that Whoopi Goldberg, too?  Yeah.  Oh, Whoopi's terrific, though.  I mean, she just gets me every time.  You know, sister act.  That was sarcasm.  You need to be on TV.  Did you have a problem on Tough Crowd with Janine Garofalo, too?  I did the first episode of Tough Crowd ever with her, and she hated my guts.  She did. 
[03:35:00]  I didn't like her either, but I did a very vicious.  Colin had us issue fatwas.  And, of course, this is what Janine's fatwas was, you know, because, you know, again, it's  a comedy show, so why attempt comedy?  She said, I'd like to issue a non-violent fatwa to Lynn Chaney for fighting free speech  on college campuses.  And then she gave, like, the little face, and then she got an applause break.  Oof.  I wanted to kick her in the face.  It's like, not only are you unfunny, but you're predictable and boring to boot.  You get the trifecta, you hole.  And then I did a really vicious one about Rosie, and she was indignant and upset. 
[03:35:30]  Of course she was.  Of course she was.  She's so above anything like that.  Oh, yeah, freedom of speech is fine as long as it goes hand-in-hand with the ideology of  the left.  She just sucks.  All right.  Bill, so what do you think of O'Reilly there?  Why am I calling you Bill?  Brian.  Oh, do I think of Bill O'Reilly?  Yeah, sorry about that.  Bill O'Reilly's a great guy.  Absolutely.  I mean, you've got to be...  If you're going to talk to Bill O'Reilly, you've got to have something to say.  He's not one of these guys you have a lot of small talk.  Can you believe how cold it is?  Can't get anywhere with him.  We survived Bill O'Reilly. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah, we did a little thing with Bill.  And then they had some fun with the editing, but we survived.  It was that whole special they did on the corruption of the American youth.  Oh, were you on the national show?  Yeah.  On that national magazine show?  And that was pretty funny.  Yeah, we just talked about the show, and he's like, well, your show is all about sex,  isn't it?  I'm like, well, it's not all about sex.  It's part of the show.  I saw that.  It was good.  With just, you know, it's things guys enjoy, and sex is part of that.  It's like, you know, you like looking at girls, Bill? 
[03:36:30]  You like, you know...  Well, obviously.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He likes calling them from...  Brian's getting uncomfortable over there.  Yeah, right.  I didn't follow that story.  Yeah, that was a biggie.  Yeah, that was big.  That was a biggie, man.  But, you know, he got out of it.  Seems to have skated, I think.  I think he's just as fine as he was before.  That's actually up.  Everything's up.  Radio's up.  Well, controversy always helps you in the end.  I guess so.  As long as it doesn't go too far.  It's helping us.  You know, the fact is, it made us bigger.  Yeah. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah, we're sorry.  Whatever.  Yeah, apologize.  Blah, blah, blah.  Brian's got a book out, The Games Do Count, America's Best and Brightest on the Power of  Sports.  And it looks like a pretty good book.  What is it about?  What I did is I talked to all these guys, from Robin Williams to Dennis Leary to, what  other comics did I talk to?  From the President of the United States, got into the Oval Office, talked to Gerald Ford.  All these guys have one thing in common.  They played sports.  None of them great.  Kurt Russell was near a major leaguer.  But besides that, of the 73 people, they all strived, they tried to be great, they weren't. 
[03:37:30]  And then they used that and they built on it.  So I have these 73 stories from Burt Reynolds on the cover, John Irving, the writer, to Gerald  Ford.  Burt Reynolds, professional wife-beater, was he?  Burt Reynolds, no, I guess they had some problems.  He was a very good actor.  Well, I guess he is a very good actor.  Football player at Florida State, Jack Welch, a lot of rich guys, real bad athletes like George  Will are in it.  But they played.  George Will, that guy on Meet the Press, won one game in basketball and baseball his  last two years of high school.  That's like he lost over 200 games. 
[03:38:00]  But he still loved it.  You know, because when your coach cuts you, when you get benched, when you score the winning  goal, when Jon Stewart's in the book, he's the second guy in the book.  Look, Jon Stewart, if you want to straighten that guy out and don't want him left, talk  about soccer.  This guy took it so serious.  Really?  All the way through.  He says when the national team coach, when he went to William & Mary at Virginia, recognized  him as a player.  He said that was one of the greatest moments of his life.  This guy talks to the who's who of the world.  But something about sports grounds you.  You know, father-son relationship, things like that. 
[03:38:30]  Everyone always has that fantasy.  Did you guys play?  Being a sports hero.  I played basketball for Harborfields High School.  Did you?  That was my dream to be in the NBA.  And that is a big high school.  Yeah.  So if you make that team, you've got to be good.  I did all right, actually.  I did okay.  But now you're being taught that keeping score is wrong.  That is so wrong!  And, you know, actually, Bernie Mac, another comic, did it.  Bernie Mac got cut five times his freshman year.  Yeah.  And by his senior year, he was one of the better players.  But they used to come up to him and say this stuff like,  Hey, why are you showering, Bernie?  You're not playing. 
[03:39:00]  That stuff ate at him.  So when he got good, when he got to be the best comic,  you know, he used that to fuel himself.  All his failure.  Do you know that Michael Jordan got cut from his team?  Yeah, but that's not what I'm talking about.  See, this is what bothers me.  He gets cut as a sophomore.  He gets told to play JV.  And they act like it's a tragedy.  Right.  The rest of us are just trying to make the starting lineup.  You know, and it's no big deal.  You have to play JV with the rest of the world.  By junior year, you're the best in the country.  And James Brown played basketball?  Awesome.  I see him on the cover.  The Fox Sports.  James Brown. 
[03:39:30]  Oh, I thought it was the other James Brown.  Well, they both, you can't tell.  They're both young.  I don't know.  I was thinking it was James Brown.  You think it was the King of Soul?  Yeah.  No, it's the King of Fox Sports.  It's the anger.  Oh, all right.  I didn't recognize.  I don't know.  James Brown's on TV.  Oh, you just missed it.  Carol Walt, Kim Alexis, too.  A lot of women there.  So if you see these guys, a lot of times you learn that stuff.  Connelisa Rice was a skater?  Figure skater?  Up at four in the morning, like you guys,  only without the radio, without the microphone, she was skating.  Says she was just okay.  But an excellent golfer and tennis player. 
[03:40:00]  She's a golfer?  A golfer.  What about that?  I did not know Connelisa Rice was a golfer.  You have to see her in person.  Have you seen her?  No.  She is ripped.  Really?  She works out for like two hours a day.  I mean, she is ripped.  Would never have known that.  I'm just telling you.  He's going to help you.  I really don't look at her body at all on TV.  You know, there's a guy in Philly that he's really mad  because he thinks the bad breath bomb is not a joke, Anthony.  Why?  Phil, go ahead.  Yeah, that bad breath bomb. 
[03:40:30]  That wasn't referring to a certain producer's bad breath.  That was an actual bomb.  How would that work, sir?  I don't know.  It was on that news.  There was a news clip about that gay bomb,  and they were referring to all the weird bombs  that they were trying to design.  And that was one of them was a bad breath bomb.  I don't know where this stuff comes from.  I know.  Could be, but, you know, the Internet has opened up so much crap to people as real news.  Wouldn't you have to eat the bomb to get the bad breath bomb to be effective? 
[03:41:00]  This is the real McCoy.  I'm telling you, it was on either Fox or one of those CNN programs.  Maybe you breathe something in, and it sticks to your tongue.  You drop garlic bread on the enemy.  That's stupid.  Not real.  Rich from New York, go ahead.  Hey, what's going on, bud?  Hey.  I heard one of the other bombs that the troops that they were working on  was called the foot bomb.  And when they dropped it, it would fly down and kick the enemy troops right in the liver.  Hey.  Oh, like a certain dog named Chester?  I don't know what he's talking about.  I'm sorry you had to sit through that, Brian. 
[03:41:30]  Want to take a very quick break, and we'll continue with Brian from Fox & Friends?  You know, we've got to ask him about Psycho Mark's famous interview.  Oh, yeah, yeah.

[03:44:00]  Rufy and Anthony, XM 202.  Foxy Lady.  Foxy Lady.  Foxy Lady.  We're hanging with Brian from Fox and Friends.  He wrote a new book,  The Games Do Count America's Best and Brightest on the Power of Sports.  And I guess how sports influence all these celebrities that we know and love, right? 
[03:44:30]  Right.  Or famous people.  Yeah, whatever.  And guys, we'll have to say,  it was number seven on the New York Times list.  Right up until Christmas.  Oh, nice.  There you go.  Did you give everyone a copy at Fox and Friends?  No, they're paying.  They're paying?  I mean, they charge me for my own book.  I have to pay $12 a copy if I want to get the book.  Really?  Yes.  Like, yours were free.  They didn't give you a box?  One box.  How quick that goes when people walk up to you and they,  when you guys write a book, have you written one yet?  No, we're working on.  We're in talks.  No one expects you to pay. 
[03:45:00]  Like, you have friends over there like,  how you doing?  Can I have your book?  Book, please.  Wait a second.  It costs money.  You can't get a friend of yours to pay for your book.  No, no.  So I just say, I don't take any phone calls anymore.  Because people want me to give them stuff.  That actually happened with Satellite Radio.  A lot of my family and even friends are like,  hey, you going to hook me up with Satellite?  And they give you like two freebies or whatever.  And I got like, I'm one of seven.  Not counting my mom.  And then you got cousins.  And then, I mean. 
[03:45:30]  I think I'm paying for 10 separate accounts.  At least.  You are not.  I swear.  I'm paying 10 accounts that I've,  you bought the equipment,  signed up these people for for two years.  Yep.  So I've spent hundreds, probably thousands of dollars on Satellite Radio for people.  Every month, my bill from XM is at least a couple hundred dollars.  And then they read in the paper, you know,  that me and Opie are making $30 million.  Because it's in the paper, it's got to be true.  Right.  So, you know, they're like, ah, come on.  So they're like, ah, hook me up.  Me a bag of shells. 
[03:46:00]  Easy come, easy go.  Easy come.  He's, I had it, and I went with it.  So how is our friend Psycho Mark?  Psycho Mark's a great guy.  We love Psycho Mark.  And he is, he's so energetic.  And now, I guess, you just told me he's with Alan Combs.  I thought he was with Bill O'Reilly for a while.  He was.  I know he's doing Alan Combs' show.  He's like board-opping and kind of producing, I guess.  Wasn't he working with you guys for a while?  He worked with us for a long time.  What happened?  Was he micing people or something?  I don't know if you can remember.  He engaged every future guest, like before the guest came on, like he debriefed them. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah.  And a lot of them were dispirited when he was done with them and didn't want to come on.  And after a while, we had to make a decision.  Do we get guests?  Oh, my God.  That's funny.  That is so Psycho Mark.  He acted like him and Bill O'Reilly were drinking every day and they were buddy-buddies.  Well, here's the thing.  I could see that in that this.  Everyone's afraid to talk around Bill O'Reilly.  And then I realized the best thing to do with people like that, especially Bill, is just talk to him.  Engage him.  Then you're the one guy that talks to him. 
[03:47:00]  And he is so fearless.  I could see him walking up and go, what's with you?  How tall are you?  What's with your attitude today?  And that would almost relax a guy that walks around.  People don't know.  Bill O'Reilly is what, like 6'5 or something?  He's huge.  He's a big guy.  Unbelievable.  But when Anthony and I got fired for the Sex with Sam, the couple doing their thing at St. Pat's Cathedral,  all you guys were looking to talk to Anthony and I and we refused to talk to anyone.  We're like, nothing good could come out of this.  Yeah, we couldn't.  We couldn't and we didn't want to because what are we going to say, you know?  Never comes out good.  So you guys got Psycho Mark because he was working on our show. 
[03:47:30]  Oh, yeah, that's right.  It's one of our favorite pieces of audio because he gets everything wrong.  You guys are buying everything he's saying.  You put him in a suit?  You put him in a suit?  We didn't give him a clothing deal.  He had to supply that.  He had to borrow someone's suit, though.  He borrowed someone's suit and he's sitting there in the suit that doesn't fit him.  Yeah, he had like a menial job at Fox and, you know, because this was the big story.  He throws a suit on.  You guys get him a limo for a day.  You mic him up and there he is on Fox and Friends. 
[03:48:00]  It's one of the funniest things we've ever seen.  Yeah.  Because we know the guy.  We know how much of an F-up he is, you know?  Now, wait a second.  You never talked to him.  He said he was keeping in touch with you guys.  Yeah, no, he wasn't.  Oh, my God.  We barely knew what was going on on a minute-to-minute basis.  You want to hear a little of this?  Me and Opie would talk to each other and we had no clue really what was going on.  Who was calling us?  Where we might end up if our contract is going to be used against us?  All that stuff we didn't know up until probably a couple of months before we got rehired. 
[03:48:30]  Yeah.  Psycho Mark knew that day.  He had all the answers.  He knew who was calling us to be hired, where we were going to end up, how we were going to...  He knew everything, and it was so funny.  You want to hear a little bit of it?  Yeah, let's hear a little Psycho Mark.  Fortunately for a couple of guys who are making millions of dollars a year, Opie and Anthony  in New York City, they were fired yesterday after a couple was caught having to go to  St. Patrick's Cathedral, and it was all being broadcast on their radio show.  Jenny, it's now with some exclusive details. 
[03:49:00]  He's a member of that cast, Mark Walsh.  Exclusive details.  Mark Walsh.  There he is.  Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark.  I'm looking at the TV like they did not get him to talk to us.  Oh, I know.  Do you know how much pot this guy smokes on a daily basis?  For any of the newer listeners, Psycho Mark is a character that was on our show from the  beginning of the time we were at NEW.  And he's Psycho.  That's hence the name.  From Boston.  He got fired from NEW during one of the Sex for Sam things. 
[03:49:30]  Right.  It was during the second Sex for Sam, I believe, that we did.  And he got fired because he had his couple go into our boss's office and had them do  backdoor action on the boss's couch.  While another boss was saying, no, no, no, do not do it.  Saying, no, don't do that.  Psycho Mark looked him right in the face, looked at his couple, and said, go ahead, do it.  And they threw him out.  And that's when he got the job at Fox.  But Psycho Mark was that guy. 
[03:50:00]  And that's why we loved having him on the show.  He was that guy, if you brought in an M-80 into school and didn't have the balls to  put it down the toilet and light it, you'd give it to Psycho Mark because he would absolutely  do it.  Hence the name.  Psycho Mark.  Yeah.  And he started the whole assault on the media.  Yeah.  That has happened to you guys a bunch.  You know, the wow signs and the O.P. and Anthony signs.  He'd run behind the people.  Oh, he started the whole thing for our show anyway.  Sure.  I don't know how original the idea is.  He'd run behind the people doing their remotes with signs.  That's how we used them on our radio show.  And then he gets fired.  And now he's working for Fox. 
[03:50:30]  I know.  Yeah.  And we hit you guys a bunch of times when you guys would do the street stuff.  Yeah.  You'd hit us all the time.  And also with Psycho Mark, he evidently had a bird's eye view of 9-11.  It was planes hitting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's the other time we were interviewing him.  We went from Psycho Mark, the crazy guy I knew and could control, to he's our featured  guest and someone who watched the planes hit the towers.  Yeah.  He would have two distinct voices.  One was the Psycho Mark voice like this.  He'd go, gack, gack, gack.  I'll take a .50 cal and shoot you, you ass.  Gack, gack, gack.  And then there was the one you're interviewing.  Yeah, it was a difficult time for everybody. 
[03:51:00]  That was so true.  Here in my apartment building, we had a perfect view of the carnage that happened.  Gack, gack, gack.  A little trivia.  The shot they showed of Ground Zero that all the news organizations use, that was from  Psycho Mark's apartment.  Yeah.  He rented out his apartment to the news.  And one of his jobs was just to watch the camera.  And they would always go to that shot.  Yeah.  He said that was a very depressing time in his life because he had to watch what was being  filmed the whole time.  And all it was was carnage. 
[03:51:30]  So let's go back to the exclusive interview with Psycho Mark.  And it's Open Anthony.  On those Open Anthony listeners, that's Psycho Mark.  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Good for having me on.  Mark, it's good to see you again.  Thanks for having me on.  You weren't there, you idiot.  Brian just said, didn't you just mic me before we did this?  Thanks for having me on.  That's his official voice now.  Thanks for having me on.  I'm a very busy person.  We don't have any of those old clips of him doing spots and stuff where he would start  talking and going.  We're running out of show. 
[03:52:00]  I'm sure we can find him.  Because the contrast between that Psycho Mark and this Psycho Mark is amazing.  Thanks for having me on.  Thanks for having me on.  How's your coffee?  Did I make it right for you before I sat down for this exclusive interview?  Do people understand?  Oh, thanks for having me on.  Mark, it's a thrill to see you again, especially clean.  Yeah, exactly.  With a suit and everything.  I know.  I didn't know you were one.  I feel like a pundit, you know.  Give it back to John Scott at the end of the show.  That's part of the deal.  Fair deal.  But, Mark, let's talk seriously what happened.  Fred was the one, our producer here, to inform you about what happened. 
[03:52:30]  You've talked to Obi and Anthony since.  What's their feeling about getting...  Well, it was a huge thing, needless to say.  I mean, needless to say, the entire stunt was a bad thing.  What happened...  This is the guy.  It was a bad thing.  Needless to say.  Needless to say.  The stunt was a bad thing.  Last year, when I got fired for this, it wasn't as bad as this.  This is a bad thing, needless to say.  Needless to say, needless to say.  Great.  What happened was entirely wrong.  And the boys are very upset that it even happened. 
[03:53:00]  What was at stake here was a trip to the Sam Adams plant up in Massachusetts.  And whoever got the most points would get the free trip, right?  Exactly.  And the way you get points is?  You go around town and the couples would engage in ludax.  Ludax.  So they'd have sex in different places.  Exactly.  For points.  And then someone picked the St. Patrick's Cathedral.  And even with a 40-second delay...  Well, what happened before the show was...  And it was explained to everybody that took part in the show. 
[03:53:30]  Do not go to St. Patrick's Cathedral.  This was told to all the participants before we even went on air that day, okay?  Is that true?  Uh, no.  Oh, St. Patrick's?  No.  But we didn't say go there.  It was just like...  We threw church on the list just to kind of be shocking.  Honestly, we didn't think anyone had the ball to actually go to a church.  We had the list in front of us.  And, of course, reading off the list was part of the show.  So we would read off things like Tiffany's, Hard Rock Cafe, F.A.O. Schwartz, and then church. 
[03:54:00]  Like, it was written on the list, but it was one of those things that you said over the air,  but never really intended God people to go there.  Yeah, exactly.  Oops.  But he makes it sound like, you know...  It was never written on there.  We're completely innocent.  Thanks for having me.  Can I just jump in real quick?  I mean, any church.  There was like 25 points that you could get for going into a church.  Wouldn't you just think any church would blow people's minds?  Well, most of the stuff that happens is, it's radio.  It's on air.  It's a description. 
[03:54:30]  It's theater of the mind, so to speak.  In other words, those things necessarily aren't really happening.  They are described as on the air.  Now, wait a minute.  Are you saying they didn't really have sex?  Because the usher says the people were partially naked.  I'm not going to get into the...  If they wanted to do theater of the mind, they would have been in a car outside and said,  we're inside the church, okay.  Well, what happened was, there's a fail-safe system on a show.  There's a 40-second delay that they use.  In other words, they have up to 10 times to dump on a show within 40 seconds. 
[03:55:00]  How does he know?  He doesn't know correctly.  He doesn't know what he had.  He doesn't know.  10 times, I could give you exact button locations.  I'll write you a map.  He hadn't been...  Well, he didn't know.  Do you want me to call, tell him to call, tell him to call you guys?  He should absolutely call us.  We got it.  It's been too long.  We got to talk to you.  Let's get back to this, because we're running out of show here.  So if something gets aired that's inappropriate, there's an opportunity to take it off the show.  So why didn't they dump it?  Well, that's what happened. 
[03:55:30]  There's a whole chain of command, the system that works, with the program director and the general manager.  All suspended.  Well, they both have boxes in their office and are able to dump out of the show at any time.  Now, they should have been on the post that afternoon, monitoring the show.  Now, these guys, this is Opie and Anthony.  You know, you're not talking about...  What our bosses should have been doing.  You don't go to them for news, weather, and sports.  This is not Paul Harvey.  Exactly.  You don't tune into Fox for, you know, dirty jokes.  They're...  Right.  They're shock jocks.  Right.  So you've got to stay on top of them.  They're shock jocks!  They're shock jocks!  He was the most shocking member of the show back then. 
[03:56:00]  They're shock jocks.  They're shock jocks.  I had nothing to do with them.  Really?  Well, Mark, you weren't the one that held up the C-word on live TV for us.  I love Mark.  But we're shock jocks.  Right.  So you've got to stay on top of them all the time.  So yesterday they got fired.  The general manager and the program director have been suspended.  Are they going to get canned, too?  Most likely.  And what happened is the formats will probably change at the station.  You'll probably see a switch probably to light music.  Gotcha.  You're kidding me.  So they're going to lose all that talk and that dramatic switch that no Carmazon made happen. 
[03:56:30]  Well, they're on several markets as well.  They're number one in Philly.  They're number one in Buffalo.  They're number one in Cleveland.  Where do they?  Detroit.  Detroit.  That's right.  We were never on in Detroit.  We were never on in Detroit.  Yeah.  And Cucamonga.  He's the best.  Well, I hope there's not other guests.  Did they move to another station to do their show from there?  Because they were fired from Boston.  Were they?  Exactly.  They were also fired from doing something.  But you know what?  I spoke to them last night. 
[03:57:00]  Is that correct, Mark?  Yes, for the mayor's death.  Yeah, they made believe the mayor died.  But this is Opie and Anthony.  I mean, these guys, they said the mayor was dead on April Fool's Day.  I mean, come on.  Who's going to really believe it?  Well, ultimately, this just...  People know it's April 1st.  Come on.  Ultimately, though, this shows you how far afield shock jocks have gotten.  I mean, it used to be just Howard Stern just talking quasi-dirty, but now we're having sex in a church.  The Catholic League, with 350 members, now says, you know what? 
[03:57:30]  Since they got canned, we're not going to push for WNEW to lose their license.  So they're stepping away from it.  Which is a fair shot.  And they had every right to be mad.  I mean, Bill Donahue is a good guy.  Real quickly, did they ever talk to Opie and Anthony, did they ever sit there and say,  well, maybe this is going over the line, or was it just like, hey, let's push the envelope?  It all goes over the line.  It happened so fast.  In other words, it made the air, and it's like, you know, you stepped in crap.  Oh, God, you know, what do you do?  You're in it.  And it was too late.  Can we leave that out? 
[03:58:00]  It was hard.  Mark, my last question, are they going to sue to get their jobs back?  Because this is what they do.  They might have a lawyer.  Chances are they'll probably, they're in negotiations right now with another company.  And we'll probably see them back on the air shortly.  So they'll take millions of dollars from CBS for leaving and go get another job someplace else.  Most likely, that's exactly what's going to happen.  All right, Mark Walsh, thanks very much for giving us the exclusive details on the morning.  All right, thanks very much.  The best part, we were in negotiations.  No, we weren't.  No.  We'll be on the air shortly.  Two years.  Yeah, after he said that statement, it still took another two years, and then we start negotiating. 
[03:58:30]  But he knew for sure that we were negotiating already.  You've got to love Mark, man.  Wow, a lot of time has passed.  Yeah.  Well, guys, thanks for having me on.  I really appreciate it.  Well, Brian from Fox & Friends, definitely a lot.  You've got to come by and say hi.  I mean, you're right down the road.  I will.  Can you provide a shuttle bus?  I'm freezing.  I still can't feel my limbs.  Yeah, we'll figure something out.  What's the name of Brian's book, Hopi?  Well, thanks, Jimmy.  It's The Games Do Count.  It's America's Best and Brightest on the Power of Sports. 
[03:59:00]  And you got it free.  Thank you.  Nice.  It's on the New York Times bestseller list, right?  Yes.  And also, you can get the Goofy Calendar, too.  Don't promote the calendar.  That's a gift.  Oh, that's a gift?  Okay, that's a gift to you.  To track the whole year.  Jim, I'm sorry I forgot you.  Oh, that's okay.  All right?  I would like one, though.  $19.  $19.  I only give out two free ones.  All right.  Well, this was a lot of fun, Brian.  Thank you so much.  All right.  I hope I didn't bring the show down with the news.  No, no, no, no.  What's this music?  Is this generic? 
[03:59:30]  Can't you guys play a real music?  We have to use a generic.  This is our...  This is actually very clever.  It's our two-minute warning.  If you know video games.  This is the old...  What is it?  Mario?  Mario Brothers.  Super Mario Brothers game.  And it gets faster and faster when we're ready to get off the air.  By the way, Ben just gave me the news that the book is linked on ONA.com.  OA.com.  Wow.  There you go.  I appreciate it, guys.  Thank you.  No problem.  Thanks, Ben.  They love...  Our listeners love eating the covers off those books.  And when are you doing our show?  We have to do a simulcast.  Yes.  Well, we're doing CNBC today. 
[04:00:00]  We are?  Yeah, Donnie Deutsch's new show there.  Oh, that's a big idea.  Danny.  Donnie.  Donnie.  What's his first name?  Donnie.  Donnie.  He should come on our show so people will see it.  Yeah, exactly.  We need you on Fox.  We did the John McEnroe show.  No one saw it.  Yeah, I did that show.  And that was also the day that the Red Sox decided to win the World Series for the first time  in 86 years.  There's one more question for Brian before we leave.  That's it.  Party is over.  Everybody go home.  Beat the Beat in the show.
