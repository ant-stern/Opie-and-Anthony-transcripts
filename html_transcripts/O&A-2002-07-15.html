<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a recap of their wildly successful TNA with O&A event in Buffalo, New York.  Over 5,000 attendees engaged in extensive nudity and public sex acts, including numerous lesbian encounters on a beach and a "whipped cream zucchini contest" substituting for the planned bikini contest. The hosts detail the less-than-stellar hotel conditions, unruly guests (including a large school group), and police involvement stemming from approximately 250 complaints. Despite the chaos, event organizer John Paul declared it the best radio promotion ever.

The show then transitions to their experience at Ozzfest.  They discuss Ozzy Osbourne's performance, contrasting opinions on its quality and comparing it to bands like System of a Down, with detailed analysis of Ozzy's stamina and stage presence, including speculation about his reasons for pouring water on himself.  Listener calls contribute further anecdotes about both Buffalo and Ozzfest.  Numerous sponsors are advertised throughout this segment.

A heated debate ensues regarding the merits of Ozzy Osbourne versus U2 and Dave Matthews Band, with strong opinions and accusations of close-mindedness exchanged.  The conversation meanders into discussions about *Friends*, music commercialization, Bono's perceived pomposity, and a less-than-stellar David Lee Roth performance. A previous tense, yet humorous, interview with Phil Anselmo of Pantera is also referenced.  Commercial breaks punctuate this segment.

The next segment highlights their Buffalo trip, including the abundance of video footage, some of which appeared on buffalothong.com.  Jim Norton's airport security experiences are contrasted with an encounter with "Uncle Junior" from *The Sopranos*.  Norton's attempts to get a picture with the actor are recounted.  A low-altitude flight approach to LaGuardia causes anxiety.  The hosts express extreme anger at John Walker Lindh's plea deal, voicing violent wishes toward him.  Their high New York ratings and upcoming station changes are briefly mentioned.  Francine's dating commentary is featured, along with advertisements for Magna's Irish Cider, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Avacor, and other products. Opie recounts a joke that bombed at Ozzfest.

The final segment includes a discussion of a caller's son who joined the Taliban, with the father expressing pride, prompting graphic and violent speculation on the son's potential prison experiences.  The conversation shifts to a Sesame Street character with HIV in South Africa, sparking a debate about political correctness.  A caller, Quinn, discusses attending a WWE Raw event.  Other topics include a quadriplegic suing a strip club, a letter from (deceased) Ann Landers regarding a 12-year-old boy's sexual activity, one host's childhood encounter in a tree fort, and a humorous bathroom encounter with a developmentally disabled individual.  Commercial breaks feature weight-loss supplements, satellite radio, and LASIK surgery.  Francine jingles are played. The show concludes with listener feedback summarizing what they learned.

[00:03:30]  just grabbed him and took him away somewhere i think they tuned them up what he was trying to make  some time with the strippers yeah i guess he saw some ladies going toward the who was in that limo  that's what i want to know who was in there when those chicks were going there because some guy decided  he was going to go in and kind of pull his pants down in front of the limo and and try to show the  girls what he had or right i don't even know what was going on and the cops just pounced him man at no  other event that we've ever done and we've done quite a few have i ever seen the women working 
[00:04:00]  security showing their wares it was unbelievable even the chicks running security were up  front and center just showing their cans they had no choice they had over 5 000 people shouting  whip them out whip them out whip them out that's right over 5 000 people went to our oh yeah on  saturday we were expecting you know a thousand a thousand of our listeners right that would have  been a success they just kept coming and coming and coming and coming the entire beach in front of us 
[00:04:30]  just full of people boats all over the place and then you look further back and and you see the uh  the water there's just boats all pulled right up watching watching the debauchery we're gonna have  so many pictures and video clips up on foundrymusic.com in the coming days yeah i think the buffalo website's  gonna have pictures uh all our websites will have pictures yeah my voice will not last four hours i just  realized joe from east rockaway is asking is this the anthony and brother we show with the way your voice 
[00:05:00]  well i i have one complaint and he's a great guy john paul who brought us to buffalo on yeah  he he had a just a tiny little monitor like you know something you would set up in a bar for a beer night  right for what a beer night peter brady i know a beer night and uh we really had to project our voices  we were shouting yelling so we could get some sound through these uh speakers and hence i lost mine 
[00:05:30]  yeah what no i thought you were going to mention the crack hotel we stayed at  it wasn't a crack hotel we'll get almost we'll get there not quite that high on the hotel chain  he's always has a problem no that hotel was a nightmare stunk it was a nightmare yeah great place  if you're filming a snoop video it was awful yeah we had a slight problem with the hotel i felt like 
[00:06:00]  i was in a cd like trucker motel because uh my my room was right next to the highway cars cars and  trucks all night long like you felt like you're at one of those motels they see up and down uh 95 and  stuff you know all you need is the red neon sign blinking outside your window yeah it's pretty much  would have just closed the deal and i was in a smoking room and by the time we got back to the  hotel i was too lazy to try to get a non-smoking room i forgot how much i hated uh the cigarette  smoke disgust really you had to get a smoking room and then the animals that took over the hotel for 
[00:06:30]  the night i don't know what it was all i saw coming out of the elevators was a bunch of savages  there there were a bunch of savages i don't know what we got back from the tna with o and a gig in  buffalo we're outside the hotel and bus after bus starts pulling up yeah from great adventure  no uh from six flags i'm sorry oh they were up at six flags yeah there were kids running around  that hotel all night long i think some of them had guns i believe it something going off in the 
[00:07:00]  hallway i believe that and then you know you're in a good hotel with a lot of great guests when  uh you leave your room and the uh elevated doors open up and police walk out of the elevators  looking like they're not just there to visit yeah they're on a mission it was funny because it was  obviously some kind of um school trip or some kind of summer camp trip or some kind of uh fresh air  fund work release program at least something was going on and the chaperones just could not control 
[00:07:30]  their people no so they complete they took over the whole hotel the normal quote guests were horrified  uh they broke the elevators yeah they broke the elevators so so uh i mean we you were using what  the service elevator to get so annoyed why do they have to go wilding in the lobby of the hotel why do  they have to ruin the elevators break things they're knocking on uh ben's door where are you ben was  right by the elevator he was the first room when you come out of the elevator on his floor worst place 
[00:08:00]  to be right because they're all getting out of the elevators and just banging on the the doors as  they go down the hallway uh-huh you know it just it uh norton had the best line about the um  the uh the hotel room coming back from chef's nice little italian restaurant there in buffalo  after the gig and what'd you say about the hotel i don't remember how they advertise i don't want to  blow your line bro oh we were talking about the people that are staying in the hotel and where do  they advertise in the police precinct i didn't remember saying that it was really funny yes i had a

[00:10:30]  guy got up on the uh the platform there a girl was completely naked yeah and he decided he's gonna  have sex yeah yeah he had he had some uh some uh uh he was doing some work with his digits yeah and  then uh they would have gone all at it he started pulling his pants down and realized and the crowd  just starts going boom like they didn't want to see man junk but then he realized he had nothing  going on yeah yeah you don't want to do that he was gonna humiliate himself to hear five thousand 
[00:11:00]  people just laughing at you like a pig knuckle i was explaining it to some people that uh that  weren't able to go i said we were on the stage and there's just a sea of guys five thousand guys on  the beach and all of a sudden you'd see like a circle of guys and you're thinking oh man there's  a bunch of guys fighting no it was two chicks going at it in the middle of the guys yeah on the sand in  the sand just going at it security runs over there thinking they got to break up a fight and there's  two naked women oh it was great i want to thank uh uh the police the local police they did a great job

[00:13:00]  friday saturday night at dinner i was sitting next to norton and i said to him i said you know  yesterday i heard you uh ripping on tna with ona and making fun of buffalo you feel bad about that  well the name is lame the way you know what it explained it it certainly did because it was  it should have been t a and p uh because i saw i saw a lot of uh a lot of snee yeah that one girl  she was able to stand up on the cement that was we were trying to tell the girls look don't go up on 
[00:13:30]  the little one foot wide cement wall uh we were elevated above the crowd on this platform and they're  standing there precariously perched ready to fall in and she lifts one leg up she's got nothing on  and just points it right at the crowd i'm like if she falls into that crowd there's going to be  about 20 fingers disappearing yeah it's gonna leave me it's gonna look like seagulls attacked  it's great though man i haven't had a chance i got the right bird good i haven't had a chance to talk 
[00:14:00]  to the club owner today to find out what his thoughts were but i'm sure he uh he had to be  pretty happy i talked to him before uh i left and yeah he said he had a great time yeah he pretty  much wanted to give us oral treats he was so happy he's never sold more beer in his life  um what happened with the news station up there oh saturday night i was watching tv and the uh the  abc affiliate had a quick story it was quick it was maybe 30 seconds long and they were talking about  how the erie county sheriff's department had 250 complaints and that to opie syndicated talk show 
[00:14:30]  hosts opie and anthony were in for tna with ona and there was you know nudity and drinking and it was  loud and that was about the whole gist of the story they actually had a camera crew out front  they didn't come inside too bad they should have had a boat you know if they had a boat with a zoom  on that camera they'd have gotten some really great shots i don't think they're gonna be able to prove  that there was a lot of nudity going on no i mean i don't think anybody had a video or cameras  yeah the year 2002 i don't think uh that stuff gets around of course not 
[00:15:00]  foundrymusic.com easy all the fun stuff all right john thank you all right man thank you guys it was  great we'll do it again thanks for everything if anything else uh pops up that you remembered uh  please give us a call back okay all right it's all about buffalo today right oh yeah and it's all  about philly today we'll get into the ozfest stories and it's all about new york city today  details on the way john yeah  all right i love when you get there buffalo i got that was really aside from the dumb accidents

[00:38:00]  so guys anyone uh anyone take the uh two fist tests over the weekend over the weekend i forgot  anything last night when you were home ladies anything did you were you in a state where you  can finally give yourself a true fist test now this was something that came up on the show uh last  week a guy called in and was bragging how how uh endowed he is yeah and said he uh he could do the 
[00:38:30]  two fist test and then some yeah he he was able to uh wrap two fists around it and still have um  like a helmet sticking out of the top so everyone started thinking  hmm do you pass do you pass the uh fist test i still don't know i didn't give myself the fist  test but i i wasn't sure about this uh you know over the weekend get a little frisky and a little 
[00:39:00]  frisky with the girlfriend and i'm i'm going i'm feeling something i'm like i'm thinking is she  giving me the fist test the two fist i think she was giving me the fist test and then i was getting  all paranoid like if i don't stack up because you got little hands  it's like man if i don't stack up yeah i think i passed you think you passed yeah i hope i did 
[00:39:30]  did anybody i tried it with uh but it doesn't really count because for it was voss and for his  to be effective it has to be four four midget ants equals two four between you reach the halfway  mark no i didn't i didn't try i did i did one fist with two fingers in the balloon notch does that  sound for anything that's classic because i have to stimulate you know right right i will do the uh  two fist test tonight will you i'll have a full report tomorrow on the couch with your blankie or  oh yeah i'll do it i'll do it to myself no big deal nascar is on uh the tv no one's around i'll just 
[00:40:00]  do it to myself i don't give a crap and the worst is if you even if you get it yeah it's not like  you need because you're gonna move up a quarter of an inch and stop and then go back down up a quarter  of an inch stop and go back down before you understand but you just want to know if you  stack up hey without cheating and grabbing like yam bag too yeah you know you don't want your pinky  resting on your balloon knot when you're taking this test it's not fair look at this paranoid guy  uh checking in matt what's up hey guys how you doing all right i was listening to you all talk 
[00:40:30]  about the two fisting and from what i recall the guy who called up last week was like six four right  yeah well i mean i i've been in emt for a while and i believe that your body parts are pretty much  in uh probability with your body so you should find someone the same height as you to really test  the whole theory all right there you go your theory stinks and i'll tell you why if this guy's  six four that means he has huge hands as well yep well that's what i'm saying which means there's 
[00:41:00]  a lot more ground to cover well i don't know i mean maybe you should bring him in and check it all  out then but i feel well you think we should why don't you yeah maybe we could ask him uh you know uh  just to take it out we could do the test and we could all laugh and lick the helmet shut up  and then we'll give him an oral exam yeah i'm just gonna punch me good day good day sir good day  kenny what's going on good day guys hey hey norton did you get your uh picture 
[00:41:30]  uh you know what of course not i met everyone but ozzy oh that's right we left that uh open at the  end of us are i heard he was looking for you you guys just kept missing each other i met everyone  but ozzy we saw ozzy walk by our tent our broadcast tent i know i'll get to that in a second uh but  norton did not get his picture with ozzy he got his picture with everybody else that was at  i got rob zombie the rob zombie you missed it in i was backstage with uh jim false alarm he took  three pictures of guys that look like rob zombie anything one one that was not next to the the 
[00:42:00]  the the bathroom there he throws me the camera goes take the picture i turn i you know i focus  the camera real fast and i click perfect picture he he's so excited and he shows me look man me and  zombie guy was jamaican i know my jim that's not rob zombie i think it was the drummer i mean a lot  a lot of the guys in the band look a lot like right yeah the guitar player if you see him quickly you  know like that's not him he was so bummed and then he had uh uh rob zombie walked out of the the lunch 
[00:42:30]  room there for a split second i go dude there he is i i've never seen jim norton run faster in my  life and and he got it and i grabbed uh sandy obi's girlfriend i'm like come on the company and  she could i knew with a girl you'd have a better shot for somebody just less threatening and she was  great man she came and we i got the shot and there was a big reflection off the glass in the  middle and it was miserable i finally had to go to him i'm like look man i don't like hanging out  with you because you're you're obsessive like i am and some of the stuff i'm trying to work on i i have  to deal with through you i was nuts with that but i photoshopped he gets the rob zombie picture yeah let 
[00:43:00]  me explain i mean he said it kind of and there was a glass door behind so and it was now it was uh  the sun was down obviously using the flash so there's a big not even that big it was the flash was in  between jim norton's head and rob zombie's head oh it was maybe a third of the size of their heads  okay but it didn't interrupt with their faces not at all it was just in the background there was a  reflection off the uh the window of the flash okay he was so obsessed he was so happy he got  the picture with rob zombie then he's so obsessed dude dude you think i could get uh you know take 
[00:43:30]  this out with photoshop i don't know if i can i don't know if i can i'm like will you stop of course  you can about this i'm like you still got the picture with rob zombie who cares i've been to  eatabolt.com some of the pictures with your celebrities they're not even looking at the  camera you don't even care i know you're right but anyways make a long story short he did the  photoshop and it looks fine like i told you i gotta make it a little bigger though what no no no no  i chop it down you have to chop it down to upload it to the web but i have to make it a little  bigger it's too small i want people to see me and one of my other celebrity friends of course 
[00:44:00]  and i didn't i had a great time i was rapping with uh mike borden who's oz's drummer we talked about  sat it was phenomenal because you're talking uh about sabbath with uh somebody that played with  sabbath when bill ward wasn't there it was geezer uh tony ozzy and and and uh mike borden of course  when sabbath first toured bill ward didn't do it a couple years ago what do you think of zombies  set i liked it i i liked him a little bit better in the past yeah there was no stage show his set  uh was better than ozzy's no it wasn't you know whatever let me just i had a real all right go 
[00:44:30]  with zombies real quick from oz fest he uh he seemed to get tired real quick and i when i go  see a band you see how he moves on the stage i don't blame him yeah i know he swings that hair  around and whatnot the thing is i want to hear the god damn singer sing don't put that microphone at the  crowd when you can't hit the note ozzy did that a lot he's been doing that for 20 years i don't like  it exactly it's fine i don't like that he was out of breath i did know yeah he was completely out of 
[00:45:00]  breath like he'd finish a song and you could tell like on on the uh on the albums when he's  singing these songs he's way up there and this one he kicks himself down he's singing a lot lower  than he does and he's out of breath and you could tell he's not singing it because he's out of breath  so that was kind of you know but the music carries it i mean it's great they they were real tight  sounded great he was a little upset too with the crowd they weren't really responding to him like they  had in the past he was constantly throwing his arms up and going come on give me something back but 
[00:45:30]  you know when you when you're coming off a little tired on stage i gotta you know i'll defend uh  rob zombie and the rest of the the bands that are at oz fest i think it's really tough to perform  in that shed atmosphere you think yeah i mean they try to make like a mile back yeah and they try to  make like a little uh mosh pit in front and stuff but it doesn't work so now you're talking about a  lot of people that are sitting or i mean or they're standing but they can't really move around and  really rock out and then like you said the lawn seems like it's a mile away and and and and the roof of the  shed makes it so you can barely see the people on the lawn remember in elementary school i remember 
[00:46:00]  making these things called dioramas where you would take a shoe box put a little scene in it and cut a  hole in the front and look in that's exactly what it's like in the lawn seats you're trying to look  at the stage through uh the floor and the roof of the venue and you got like this little slot to look  through it's just a weird way to perform and they watch on the big screens uh those sheds watch the  the band those sheds are fine if you're gonna go see the movie blues or steve winwood yeah some of 
[00:46:30]  that crap that tours every summer chicago yeah but you know when you're talking like oz fest and then  some of these other newer bands that i i you kind of think it's a really tough uh stage to be on  yeah system of a down low man they rocked that guy's hitting the notes and sounding good  yeah let's see him do it in 30 years all right when he can do it in 30 years yeah ozzy was really  doing it dude he's 30 years whatever i was embarrassed i'm looking at ozzy not at all 
[00:47:00]  i know you're a super fan so why don't i say why didn't you tell kelly this huh why didn't you tell  kelly this thank god it was after i saw uh after we interviewed kelly hung me out to dry i got by the  way i gotta thank i was in the pit i don't like to mosh at all i'm a meaty man i don't want to mosh  there was a cop he was six foot five a jersey cop he's a fan of the show three hundred and ten  pounds yeah big guy oh he was awful just a large baby finster looking monster and he's like dude 
[00:47:30]  because he's like just stand by me if anything happens you can just step behind me i felt like  a little chick dating a big guy really every time a fight would break out he would just gently nudge  me aside nice this guy his name is matt thank you man you really made my show enjoyable because i  felt comfortable you were you were right there uh up front for ozzy looking right at ozzy he was  dead center phenomenal he got soaked by the water i didn't care and the show was great yeah yeah man  ozzy's got energy he's one of the best live performers on earth what he saw he doesn't sit on  a garcia made a living sitting on a bench for 30 years i'm glad he's still rocking but he's not the 
[00:48:00]  greatest live guy out there right now you see the crowd the way he motivated the crowd i'm telling you  watch other bands they can't keep a crowd going after rocking all day i'm telling you i'm gonna  pass my opinion on to ben because i'm not gonna sit here and act like i go to a lot of shows i don't  go to as many as i used to ben goes to just about every show that comes through new york ben what do  you think of uh ozzy on that stage well actually he was a hundred times better than he was in december  when steve and i saw him in december because he couldn't move but you had more energy this time 
[00:48:30]  system of a down kicked his ass no they're nuts dude no one cares about system oh stop it stop it  i'm not saying they're not a good band but what i'm saying pretty much they were freaking out the  crowd was going wild for them and he followed them he brings every i love to see system of a down  go on after pantera or go on after disturbed go on to marilyn manson like ozzy does he almost missed  his hands when he was trying to clap oh god no his hands were above his head and above his head and he  was it looked like he really had to think to make sure they connect oh no he was you know he wasn't bad 
[00:49:00]  but i mean i walked the whole crowd during system and during i was out on the lawn i checked it from  all angles system of a down had the crowd going right they were going animal insane out there  for both both angles the inside and out there it was crazy i mean he's not he's not bad i mean he's  just not you know he's simply the greatest life before i'm telling you there he is the best you  watch other bands they do i mean kiss is an exception because it's a constant show you're  telling me he's the best out there right now dude you're insane he's 53 years old that's fine that he's 53 
[00:49:30]  so so what what is what is what did queen do when they played right seriously any other band  what do they do you know i don't want jerry garcia sat on a stool and people rock for three  hours and enjoy them he doesn't do that i'm not a garcia fan throwing water on himself he's a  maniac on stage that's the beauty of eddie trunk what's going on i gotta jump in here for a second yeah  jim yeah you know that i am with you totally on the same page with you with sabbath and ozzy right 
[00:50:00]  but the reality is i went to see ozzy on last year's oz fest with sabbath  and i left after three songs because he all he did in the microphone was apologize to the crowd  because he had no voice at all it was like sabbath karaoke so what it didn't matter but he's been  doing that eddie did you know they live is the greatest lie listen it doesn't matter he used to  forget lyrics that's why sabbath never did a live album until they did live evil with ryan james deal 
[00:50:30]  because ozzy would forget the lyrics he's dyslexic it doesn't matter his voice goes who cares it's a  disease you're watching him it doesn't matter that's the beauty of him you want to watch someone that  sings perfectly go see sticks no one cares about that and how many times did he say i love you effing  guys that's what he's been doing for 30 years everybody's come up with something different  everybody's ripping him off you can't he said it about 10 different times and every time he said  it it was like he said it not knowing that he already said it nine times prior dude that's like  watching richard prior and going how come he's talking about black white issues all comedians 
[00:51:00]  are doing that yeah because of him dude you know what my take on all this is simple i don't think  ozzy and i don't think ozzy wants to do this anymore and i don't think he's wanted to do it for the  last 10 years i think he's kind of being pushed out there against his will i think the guy'd rather kick  back and do some other stuff i've been backstage at his shows you have no idea of the ordeal that  goes on to pump him up in order to get him out there to even perform there's paramedics that come  in there's people that give him shots the guy is like on on you know they just resuscitate him 
[00:51:30]  cart him out there for his hour and whatever they get out of them they get out of them he did an hour  and forty it looked like child abuse an hour and forty minutes dude i felt like i was watching  child abuse so much someone should step in he brought the best bands on he toured with motley  crew in 83 or he took metallica in 84 he takes the hottest bands on earth with him and he follows  them jim i hate to tell you this jim jim i hate to have this argument with you because you know i love 
[00:52:00]  united you know i love ozzy but you know what ozzy could hardly tell you anything about any of the  bands on osfest that's fine he doesn't need to he doesn't need to it doesn't matter that's the  beauty of him that's why the show is a hit it's him you are so close to the point where you're going  no he blows on stage but that's the beauty of him you're saying all these bad things are the beauty of 
[00:52:30]  him i've said no bad things it's all part of it man so what he is the greatest motivator of a crowd  watching bond scott was supposed to be great it's okay that ozzy helped you get through some tough  times in your life but you're absolutely insane nothing to do with that dude i watch i'm i was  audience i was glad that i got to see ozzy look at rob zombie shut up look i was glad that i got to see  ozzy at ozfest because i haven't seen ozzy in many many years yeah but uh you know what it was it was  cool to check him out because he's an icon but i would not sit there if i was a rock and roll reviewer  and say wow that was a great show by ozzy those five critics have never said that they didn't say 
[00:53:00]  it in 1975 that's fine but i'm saying i wouldn't say that i'm not one of those stupid rock critics  i have a pretty open mind it's cool to see an icon on the stage yes and you know all the songs yes  but as far as the performance goes it was it was lack it was lame and if zach wilde isn't up there  just losing his mind with all that energy it would be really pathetic right what's better bono running  around in yellow sunglasses being a pseudo intellectual hipster i'm serious what's better  what's brilliant you know what whether you like or hate you too they still put on a really what do 
[00:53:30]  they do solid live concert what's the solid live concert he doesn't he doesn't have to say i love  you effing guys over and over again a solid live concert is sounding fantastic exactly the band is  tight he does he sings all the lyrics he doesn't go to the crowd to get through the songs ozzy has been  doing that he doesn't have to do this goofy clapping his hands over his head and missing  his whole career ozzy's been doing he doesn't have to uh pour buckets of water uh over his head because 
[00:54:00]  you know he might have to take a leak or something hey guys one last thing and i'll let you go all  right look see now he's getting upset what i'm just reporting on a rumor why he throws water on  his head stop it i never heard that it's been reported for many years oh stop it  why are you gonna kill me you didn't say it relax not at all the rumor is he pours the  buckets of water over his head because you know he has a small bladder oh stop it i'm reporting it 
[00:54:30]  as a rumor eddie actually hope i never heard that but you know what i'll tell you what all you need  to know and i'll go after this the only thing you need to know about what ozzy is all about in his  career is the guy and if everybody watches the osborne show the guy cannot do back-to-back performances  anymore because he has a hard enough time doing one i can't do it sharon right so you see that show  and you see what happened in that show he still ended up getting back-to-back performances and what 
[00:55:00]  happens to the people that spent their hundred bucks a ticket that happen to go to night number  two in their city and they get no ozzy whatsoever that's right you know a they get a whole long and  they do get ozzy what do they want again what do you know what maybe they can maybe they can watch  some faggot seattle band sitting there in their grudge clothes all doped out if they're alive  maybe they didn't overdose if you want to hear him sing you he's been eddie you know he's been  doing that for 30 years sabbath never recorded a live album because you forget the lyrics what  you just said about seattle would have been relevant if we're doing radio in 1997 the whole 
[00:55:30]  seattle thing is long gone thank you thank you thank you it's long gone it came and it went he came in  1968 and he is still helping to sell 17 000 tickets look exactly i respect him that he's  still thank you i respect him that he's still putting on concerts but you can't sit there and  say that was a great performance it's gone it was okay it was cool to see an icon but it wasn't that  great it lasted for seven years 90 90 of the people there were there to see pod and system of a down  no they weren't yes they were but why aren't pod and system of a down because it's called oz they 
[00:56:00]  they do they do selling out that place is probably the hottest band in america right  now nobody you idiot would open for ozzy nobody would open for ozzy because sharon wouldn't have  it not at all let's not do it sharon they do it because they want to work with the show was okay  and i'm glad i saw the bands that played the main stage like he's uh the greatest live performer  today you're insane he is the greatest live performer yes he is dude the bands that played the main  stage if you took ozzy off the bill it still would have been packed then why do they do it 
[00:56:30]  why do they give ozzy most of the money maybe it's because it keeps ozzy cool and relevant  there you go that's why pod does it or why uh system of a down no no no they do it because it's  a big outdoor festival that everybody wants to get involved in but they cart ozzy out there every  year because it keeps them in the audience with the younger kids and when lalapalooza was hot a lot  of those bands could have toured on their own but it's a much bigger right deal when it's a festival  show when it was hot it's not anymore why nobody oh you think ozfest is going to last as long as  lalapalooza did no one cares how many years did lalapalooza uh uh um four or five years five 
[00:57:00]  already oh there you go do you think he's going to make it to ten not because of his age he won't  but could he continue selling sure well who knows i love the fact all these bands rip off sabbath and  they go out on their own and people think wow these guys are great really come on stop hey jim i agree  with you that sabbath that ozzy's been deteriorating but for a long time but the point of the matter is it  gets worse with each year and here's the truth dude this this is from directly from somebody 
[00:57:30]  inside every year they do the set list they have to get rid of more and more songs some which were  huge hits because when ozzy sang them on record 10 15 20 years ago he can't even come close to  singing like that anymore why do you think sabbath wouldn't do something dude i could have told you  that all right so then why is it still a good live show it doesn't bother me he's short-changing  his fans that doesn't bother me he's not short-changing his fans that doesn't bother me  i'd say i would you're not a real i would then don't go i would say that was a great performance 
[00:58:00]  if i had paid ten bucks all right you probably would but you didn't pay anything so you should  have enjoyed it you got it all right you want to talk about ozzy selling out though jim you went  to the show at jersey continental arena in uh december how that was definitely not sold out there  were a lot of no you're right it wasn't half well kid rock is the hottest thing in music and  he did five thousand tickets what do you do five thousand tickets philly no he did more than that  and and his album isn't as good yeah and his record sales are way down and it might be over 
[00:58:30]  for kid rock so that's not a good example i'm making it it's a perfect example somebody after a  couple of years who is on fire the point these guys are making is that ozzy on his own wasn't  selling many tickets jim and oz fest is sold out all over the country that had nothing to do with  ozzy beyond those when you come around twice in the same year it's difficult to sell that's  that's a reality man that's a reality jim the stones are doing stadiums arenas and clubs if  98 percent of all tickets sold you two sold out all the tickets the system of downswing at jones  beach here in new york dave matthews sold out all his tickets it doesn't mean he doesn't 
[00:59:00]  fall in who sold it so did hitler so what did he say he sold out nuremberg  dave matthews will sell i'll sell ozzy probably anywhere that doesn't mean anything to me it's a good  show you guys go with the hot bands and all the girls like go ahead i don't care have you ever  gone to a then shut your trap i don't know what you're talking about i've never drank of a black  mule either it doesn't mean i have to do it to realize i don't like it exactly uncut spanish is  a totally different world you're very close-minded with your musical taste i'm not close yeah you 
[00:59:30]  are a little bit consistent you bash u2 dave matthews they're overrated man you don't know you've  never seen it have you seen a u2 show i never will have you seen a day yeah i did see you too i've  seen dave matthews i've seen you too and i've seen ozzy recently do you want to know ozzy was the  worst by far of course you're not going to like ozzy but you should why because i know it's time to  five because i have a vendetta no i was a big sabbath fan growing up just like you no but i would  rather go see a u2 or dave matthews before i see what i saw you prefer them you prefer them 
[01:00:00]  jim doesn't it stand to reason that all if all you listen to is ozzy osbourne and black not all i listen to  that not all i listen to but that you are you are ozzy's staunchest defender in this regard and i saw  you in that pit i was right in front of you the whole time you were like a child i've never seen  that happen before you were dancing and waving your arms and smiling right i'm 100 just saying  maybe your motivation in this whole thing is a little different than a music fan just talking  about other bands with other people you seem a lot more dedicated to ozzy that's what a fan is it's not  just if you want to listen to the record sit home other bands are boring they last for three years 
[01:00:30]  they're hot and then nobody goes to see them he's been drawing since 1968 that's the beauty of  three and yeah he doesn't hit the notes anymore so what richard prior can't do it anymore because  he had ms but so what people still go to see him you want to see the bands hitting the notes you want  to see i never cared about that i swear to god no i gotta be jim dude eddie what i just honestly got  truth one of my favorite things about him is that he would butcher songs sometimes he was drunk i love 
[01:01:00]  that that's the beauty of it i loved i have i had an over the mountain from 1982 concert in cobo  detroit where he he lost his voice probably after hey thanks for coming tonight first lyric do you  think most fans of ozzy that go to the shows are thinking like you that they don't care considering  the fact that he has been drawing since 1968 i would have to say there's something to it but he isn't  drawing on his own like i said pod and system were the people that you know he had to draw on his own  you were at that show at the meadowlands in december it was empty upstairs that was a lean 
[01:01:30]  crowd because it was december and oz fest had just come through look at motley crue is doing as great  as motley crue was they're having props no that's you understand you know you just put your foot in  your mouth because other bands like you two and david uh dave matthews they sell out multiple shows my  friend and so will billy joe of course but ozzy had a chance one show all right it was close to us  says he couldn't sell it out if you want to go with who's popular he couldn't sell out hey hey 
[01:02:00]  and you're right friends been around for uh over 20 years now as well friends is the best sitcom  ever written because it's very popular around what about 25 years now 1980 they first time no they  were well they were around as the hype before that all right so we're talking 22 years for you too  absolutely yeah popular band today no they've been doing it for 22 years that's a pretty long time  that's a good track record and when they come to new york they sell out multiple shows at massive square  garden three at the garden two at the metal and you know what and friends out out bids  financially almost every other show i'm telling you i don't want to hear how many shows they sell 
[01:02:30]  out it doesn't matter you brought it up you said the reason ozzy didn't sell the the effing continental  because it was too close to oz fest that's true he's not going to draw like you too i'm going to  stop because you're embarrassing yourself i'm not i'm right what was that the mary mayhem  i'm right it actually had a good lineup it was who's uh rob zombie zombie soil mud vein uh zombie and ozzy  it's not a bad lineup was there if ozzy is as great is if ozzy is as great as you say he would  have sold out the continental he would have sold out multiple uh uh jersey and new york appearances 
[01:03:00]  on his own and still be able to do okay so you're saying that great equals popular you were the one  that brought up the lack of tickets that's why i had an argument and i kicked your ass again did not  take my ass i certainly did saying that because the only reason that ozzy didn't sell a lot of tickets  at the continental was because of the oz fest because but here's a band i really enjoy like  you too dave matthews i'm not a huge fan of but he does the same thing multiple shows i'm and i'm  saying of course they will out draw and i don't listen to your deal and i don't listen to you too 
[01:03:30]  because they're a popular band ass you're you're saying that's what makes them better i've been  listening to them since 1980 ozzy's not going to draw like you have you heard of an album called boy  i don't care of course not for what that's that's when i started listening to sabbath bloody sabbath  whatever same thing but i kicked your ass in every argument this time that's what's important to  you then that's important to you no you didn't you brought up the ticket sales they casually said  when ozzy came to the continental he could barely uh he didn't bring up sales he didn't sell that well  i didn't bring them up all right but then you had an argument said well the reason that happened was 
[01:04:00]  because it was too close to us well if this band is so great and everyone needs to see him why can't  he thank you if he's so great why didn't he sell out both shows great equals popular you're just making  my point no it's not guarantee you no there are different circumstances like that you're talking  about things like friends of course there's going to be things look look the stupid backstreet boys  and all those dopey bands sell out places they're not good they sell it out because they have this  popularity thing going exactly but but there are different things they don't all fit in the same 
[01:04:30]  category ozzy isn't selling because there aren't many people that want to see ozzy live there are  the way it is by himself of course there are a lot of people who want us best is selling out  because of all the other bands on television it's something about him and did we need the five  minute commercial before ozzy came on yeah why not that was pretty sad the way the industry has gone  with it's pretty sad bandwagon bands like you two and all this crap it's about time ozzy gets paid  a-s you two is not a bandwagon just jumping on the bandwagon saying what a stupid stupid 
[01:05:00]  i just jumped on the bandwagon oh the you two is brilliant why is bono brilliant why yeah you two's  been doing it for 22 years uh some kids that are listening to you two now weren't even born when  they started exactly yeah they're a bandwagon band no no people who like them oh yeah they're  brilliant because everybody thinks they're brilliant stop what's brilliant about him what's brilliant  about him he puts on yellow shades and he has this pseudo-intellectual nonsense who cares i don't  really give a flying crap that if he does that he writes good songs the shades are actually blue  whatever they are they're pompous i don't i don't really uh care about his politics and and and 
[01:05:30]  you know how he looks he makes a speech between every song you know what guys man we gotta stop  with the environment i shut it and sing oh and ozzy i love you guys exactly thanks for coming let me  pour another bucket of water on my head because i can't take a bathroom break shut up exactly or maybe  he should move to seattle do dope and overdose and blow his brains out and then everybody  would think he's a real genius come on stop stop i feel like i do when my parents used to argue  and i have to sit there hey on the new on the new ozzy live album his big catchphrase on that if you 
[01:06:00]  listen to it is every other sentence he yells out you're number one because he's playing to a japanese  audience and he just i guess he thinks it's like i don't know like a chinese menu thing he just goes  he he goes you're number one he's from china or japan or something he yells that in every song like four  times no he's been doing that for years that's the beauty of him he's been doing that for years  every song he should make some boring pseudo political speech no it's not that but jim 
[01:06:30]  hey dick what you said you've never seen you two live i've seen them on tell how would you know that  bono does that in between every am i right no not really not at all hasn't done it what did he just  say not anymore not at all he once did it so he never got after every song and really it's to a  minimum yeah it's to a minimum but he does it who does ozzy vote you don't know you've never the  only person uh pretty much everyone in this room except you have seen all three bands we're  arguing about and i'm a hundred but i can tell you that how do you never see your two lives and  shut your tree make political speeches you don't know what this show is all about he's an irish 
[01:07:00]  bore all i know is when i leave a youtube show i got my money's worth you gotta you gotta vote for  so-and-so shut it you dope no one wants to hear what i want to vote for uh when did he say that  you know when he said oh wait when he said making political speeches when he said who to vote for  who to vote for in the united states was the united states was it ireland when did he say that and who  was he talking about now you see what you're doing is you're taking my i'm just asking and  making it literal you know what i'm trying to say no back you know something back in like 86 87 uh  i was not into youtube because he was too political and uh well i remember they they toured once and and they 
[01:07:30]  said bono has shunned the press to let the music do the talking and i thought that was really pompous  and lame thank you but but but they puts on a good show they put on a good show i don't care what i  said i don't care what he says when he's not rocking i can put that aside i could care less if he's  trying to uh solve world hunger and all that i like the band and he and they are they're great live  when they're singing live probably the best band i've ever seen live you're right they're the best and 
[01:08:00]  it sounds just like the record that's what i want to say when i see a record why stand no because  people it amazes me you know something when you sit there and watch a band performing their music and  it sounds just like it does on the record you're watching that and you're appreciating wow those  guys are making that music right now live on that stage sound as well as it did in the studio and  that's part of the talent behind being a band like that it's part of the beauty of listening to the  music like that not to hear a hacked version of it or not even talking about ozzy like rob zombie 
[01:08:30]  that's just what i was saying i was pissed off that it wasn't sounding like the record you know  why i could see a goddamn cover band do it better but i don't want to hear that i want to hear him  sing all the words i don't want to hear him point the mic at the crowd i don't want to see an exhausted  rob zombie run back and forth two times and not be able to get a line of a song out with that you  see that's the difference between us that doesn't bother me that real honestly and i'm not i'm being  completely honest you know what you're in the minority i don't care you know how much these tickets 
[01:09:00]  are for these kids so what so what they're spending a lot of money they deserve a show  pay to do ecstasy they deserve a show and they got a show and they don't need a five-minute  commercial before ozzy comes on uh you know showing uh you know he deserves hey man that's selling out  he you're talking about selling out on this show selling out what are you talking about to start your  your your your uh performance with a five-minute commercial so what let him do it dude if if dave  matthews did that or you too you'd be down what do you mean if that at least ozzy never made 
[01:09:30]  political speed why does he need a five-minute commercial before he hits the stage for the  osbornes too because ozzy deserves to get paid i'm telling you why why why why why why why you win  that's right hey jim and also eddie can probably help me out on this eddie how many albums you hate  commercialism and that it was staring you right in the face at ozfest i never said i hate commercialism  i'm not some big five-minute commercial coming this fall i never said i hate commercialism the  osbornes too this time it's personal i have been saying that i'm happy for all this success and all 
[01:10:00]  the attention he's getting so where did i ever say i hate commercialism i never said that i'm not one  of these dummies that said are you selling out man after you try to strangle your wife and you  urinate on the alamo nothing you do for the rest of your life is selling out hey the biggest thing  the biggest mistake you're making is that you keep saying well ozzy wants to do this and ozzy's  doing that well i think he should do this dude ozzy hasn't made a decision about his career or  anything in 20 years that's the whole point none of this has anything to do with that he's a puppet 
[01:10:30]  that's the beauty but really he's a puppet he's a business manager what are you talking about he's  being carded out there dude he is out of it he has no clue he couldn't probably tell you half  the band's playing on osfest who cares the bottom line is at age 53 after 30 years he is relevant  and that's the beauty of him and i'm glad to see him finally getting paid yeah of course i get so  sick i would argue that he's he of course he's relevant but he's not putting on that good of a  show right and it's an okay show and i'm i was glad i saw so if you don't like him go i said it was 
[01:11:00]  an old faggot european rock bands that are going to sit there and preach politics watch that jim how  many albums what european rock band uh how many of them all of them how many how many did how many  of european rock movement right now the last aussie album that came out how many eddie you know how  many i honestly don't know yeah it's just it's reported to be gold which is how 500 000 that's  500 000 that's not that much that's nothing fine i don't care if you then you go by record sales  that means sure hey boy and again how many people watch friends is the same thing that means i don't i 
[01:11:30]  don't judge my music by what the other people like i don't care i'm not i'm just judging what  i saw front you're going to bring it to be it was bring this right it was uncomfortable to watch  right back around to where we started if i may the whole point of this argument this inane argument  again is did ozzy put on a good show and i would say no i i i i i wouldn't think so if you pull pulled  uh philly they would tell you it was an okay show i know i didn't say okay i'm just 
[01:12:00]  talking about what i heard from and i've seen yeah i've seen clips of him doing his performance  live recently and it just doesn't seem like it's a good show if you're just a casual fan  and i hope and i hope he's paying zag wild a lot of money because that's the reason there's any  energy on that stage not true at all this is not true it's not true at all how ozzy like gets into  that uh his hands on the floor and his feet on the floor and jumps up wow that's a that's pretty 
[01:12:30]  impressive what is that that really gets the crowd going oh he would like get in the frog  position and then jump up over and over again yeah he's been doing that since 1968 that's pretty  impressive well again then go with who's popular so watch friends that's a go watch that's a good  way to uh work hey guys everybody likes the band i like they're popular i don't watch the popular  band i was i was into youtube way before anyone else i could care less he's mentioning record sales  and i've continued i've continued to watch uh uh following youtube because they still put on a  good show and they put out great music go go with who's selling the records that's what you you 
[01:13:00]  mentioned record sales and an old mention that's exactly what i did in 1980 when uh you two were  they were just playing a nightclub you're right you're right you're right he preached from  1886 no he didn't for answers to talk about that in 1980 he didn't even know where his own  junk was why didn't he ever say that he wasn't preaching freaking politics come on yes he does  no no in 1980 he was not jim yes no no no no he walks around with his dumb shades and he's a  hipster and he stinks what did he say in 1980 who cares i wouldn't listen to him now he had no 
[01:13:30]  political uh exactly hey what's that song sabbath's doing so i can change the lyrics that's what he  probably said he's a bum you lose again thank you eddie trump hey man hey guys of course you want to  win because you got the popular song and the record sales take it i don't care i go see i  know i didn't make any of those points i don't know right you go to see him because you love him  you see him because you love him that's great i brought and you enjoy the show that's great  absolutely is he putting on what most people would perceive as a good show no i don't believe that 
[01:14:00]  because there's always people there and they stay through ozzy and they watch on you yeah because  you're looking at ozzy and i brought up uh and i brought up mohammed ali booked a fight with somebody  the place would be packed are you gonna see a good fight no you can't give people no credit you can't  i'm not giving him no credit that's not what this is about i give him the respect you have  that he deserves you have blind loyalty i respect that but you know what i respect you a blind royalty  for ozzy i i will never i i give you credit for that but you know what i'm not talking about them 
[01:14:30]  i'm a guy that's not as big as a fan as you i have an open mind i go to see a lot of shows  that was an okay show and that's all i'm saying i understand that and i'm also i have nothing against  ozzy i have nothing against black sabbath so the reason i brought up the sold out nights is because you  explain why ozzy didn't do so well as far as people going to his show in jersey yes i know  that that's exactly and i explained to you you know that there are other bands that sell out  multiple shows so what and that's why i brought up friends because the popularity of the band i 
[01:15:00]  don't want means nothing to me i've never i would never think to mention record sale i'm probably one  of the only people in america that has never seen a full episode of friends do you know that sabbath  when when black sabbath came out that album went into i think the top 20 or the top 10 of the american  charts with no advertising and nothing from the press and i could kill it means nothing to me good  i'm happy for them but it means nothing to me i wasn't even getting into that side of it all i'm  saying is they did it wasn't no no yeah but most people did not perceive it as a good show i simplified  my whole argument by saying i saw ozzy for the first time in a long time uh in philly at the oz 
[01:15:30]  fest and it was an okay show at best my point i have nothing against ozzy and i'm psyched he's  would you rather see ozzy in his heyday or now uh i've seen him in his heyday and i've seen him  now it doesn't matter it doesn't matter no no it really doesn't make sense of course it makes  sense i'm being honest with you it doesn't matter to me i'd rather remember him on on the top of his  game i've always been like that you know what i was a huge willie mays fan he he came to the  mets it was an embarrassment i wish i never saw him that way i never mind he was 40 41 years old 
[01:16:00]  playing with the mets dropping uh basket catches in the outfield that he used to make with one  hand with his eyes closed it was embarrassing and sometimes you want to remember your heroes  and your icons and maybe some of the bands you grew up uh listening to in in in a bigger state  no then you know i don't want to see i don't want to see robert plant ever again i never wanted to  see him that's fine but that's that son of the bitch was never able to sing live what he put on  the records but ever but even in his heyday i certainly don't want to see him now in their heyday i 
[01:16:30]  don't need to i don't want to remember him i don't mind remembering him like that he is who  he is i like him for i remember that's fine i remember seeing muhammad ali fight at the end  of his career you know what i i wish i never saw it because you know it's different he was bigger  than no it's not different i'll tell you the different people watching guys sing it's a lot  different than watching somebody you love no no face no people yes people have different heroes and  and and and and different things they're into there's a lot more at stake in boxing he's not going  to be killed singing you're talking no you're talking about it's simple you're talking about somebody in  his youth at the top of his game and older not at the top of his game exactly i would i would rather 
[01:17:00]  see him at the top of his game i don't care it was a better show at the top of his game and this  is anybody i'm talking i understand i hate seeing these washed up performers just fade away in front  of the public side the public eye it's it's embarrassing exactly and he's not fading away  yes he is really that's why he's got the hottest show on television you're out of your mind hey elvis  sold out vegas at the end of his life and that is was an embarrassment too the guy who was a big  fat slob sweating on stage again it was uncomfortable to see if you don't know this 
[01:17:30]  they have to be good looking and popular do you think the popularity of the tv show has anything  to do with the way he sings on stage and performs on stage no no no and that's not their watch the  best parts of the show and the reason everyone talks about it and watches it is oh my god did you  see ozzy fall off the chair oh my god did you see ozzy limping around and with that ridiculous  drawing he was doing and he's also one of the funny it's funny to look at ozzy in that situation  the situation he's in i think the show is successful because he isn't the ozzy of old 
[01:18:00]  it's it's an ozzy that you're not familiar with and i'd love to see i would love to see one of these  faggoty pseudo rockers let the public see the embarrassing part of their lives well no no let me  none of them could do it i would love to see bono do that are you kidding they're lining up everybody  is lining up they will fail miserably and they'll all be posting they will all fail  miserably none of them will truly show what he has shown in right you're right they're all going  to be a bunch of political about that we'll have to wait and see we'll have to wait and 
[01:18:30]  see no i don't see a p diddy show coming off like he's too successful nobody wants to look at good  looking guy banging jennifer lopez well he's gonna have a show similar to the uh the osborne yes and it  will be a hit it will the liza minnelli one might be good that chicks out of her effing mind  uh what's her name anna nicole smith is lining up to do one tommy lee's doing mommy lee oh great  are we gonna watch the kid drown in the pool that would be a great episode actually tommy find  someone in the pool hey here's a couple clips as we go to break well the first one uh norton  backstage at oz fest talking about his backstage pass and we got these backstage passes it's not

[01:40:00]  years years and years ago and uh this girl um she was really hot and she tried to kill herself  so me being the slob i am i was trying to capitalize on the whole situation trying to get laid  by visiting her in the mental ward i just walk in hi how are you like i'm the only one that cares about  you don't worry you try to kill yourself but i can make things so much better by really taking 
[01:40:30]  advantage of you in your delicate state i swear i did it was my prime motivation i could give a crap  about her mental thought she was really hot and i wanted a piece of it i wanted some loony sex you  remind me of something i used to do i never got anywhere but uh i was living near a church and uh  they had those meetings in the basement for uh sex addicts yeah and i would uh rollerblade by  see if this was anything going on in the parking lot anything hot there's some real hot girls that  come out of those things there was a place right on that's highway out on long i don't have the 
[01:41:00]  balls to strike up a conversation but i purposely bladed through the area and in the parking lot  and just kind of scoped it out to see if anything was happening remember that place uh the apple  building out there it used to be marion manor old age home used to scare the crap out of me we'd drive  by his kids and i'd look out there'd be this old man just rocking in his rocking chair and it was  really creepy old place what town was this in it was uh yeah right off that's highway here in new  york out on long island and um they they turned it into a drug rehab for teens and i used to drive 
[01:41:30]  by and they'd have car washes to raise money and whatnot and some hot coke horse out there in the  80s and we're like you know something why don't we buy an eight ball and we can just drive up no way  and they but they like they send people if you do you can't just pull up like counselors and whatnot would  be there and they wouldn't even let us us get our car washed because we like had this piece of  crap car that obviously that they didn't want to watch but we were thinking one of the girls come 
[01:42:00]  over we shake the little bagging in front of her and tell her we'll be by later that's incredible  take the bandages off her wrists and wipe her back off when you're finished drop her back off you know  where she lives get me back before curfew just an awful awful quest for booty back then quest for  bless it didn't matter that poor girl was yeah she took a bunch of pills and uh tried to kill  herself she's uh so hot it was just like i got i this is my end no one's visiting her you know they 
[01:42:30]  always do oh i ain't hanging out with that crazy bitch i'm like i don't care get some of that insane  booty they're goers you're right sensitive ant i was playing sensitive ant when i walked in hi how  are we feeling brought you a plant dave what's going on hey when you guys were talking earlier  about uh some maybe performers that maybe shouldn't be out there doing it anymore like they used to do  back in their heyday perfect example that you'll probably see i guess i don't know a couple weeks 
[01:43:00]  months whatever and when the david lee roth and sammy hagar tour comes to town david lee roth  completely sucks now can i say that on the radio well um there was a review in the latest issue  of rolling stone do we have that laying around a review of the uh david lee roth yeah they played  la already you gotta we gotta read this review it's short on the air it's hilarious they pretty much  said that david lee roth looks like uh a cross between oh crap dolly madison and and don knots  and someone else thrown in there oh dude he had he had no right he had no right being up there on stage 
[01:43:30]  he had some weird blue leather jumpsuit outfit on and yeah yeah and you know he can't sit for crap  he talks his way through the songs half the time he's always done that yeah he's always  yeah and and the other i see and i i i didn't remember this i was really looking forward to  seeing david lee roth i i saw him with van halen way back in the day but i had forgotten how bad he  can be in concert until i saw him again last month and he like i said he talks halfway and half the  songs the other half the songs he's all over the place not even singing it's like he's getting paid by 
[01:44:00]  the octave or something like that because he's he might start off low well my baby's on the  corner and she's looking so fine you know he's just all over the place it is just so lame that's  what he was doing in the 70s nothing has changed yeah i know but i forgot about that because you know  i guess time heals all you want to talk about a band that always sucked live it's van halen uh  the david lee roth version yeah yeah you know they were so so strong on albums but but live they were 
[01:44:30]  just bad and i like i said i didn't really remember that i just that is studio magic feeling nostalgic  and i'm thinking wow cool get to see dave again after all this time it's gonna be awesome it's gonna  be awesome uh no i blame van halen for the 20 minute drum solo yeah yeah because dave had to go back  and uh do something you know it was really  all right enough i'm going to grab a beer at that point yeah the line's dying down to get their uh 
[01:45:00]  their concert t-shirts let's go now the one one of the worst things with david lee roth when sammy  hagar took over for van halen and you know sammy's just got range unbelievable range the guy can scream  the high notes uh blows david lee roth away as far as range goes uh when when dave was uh touring by 
[01:45:30]  himself i heard him do a live version of jump and he was trying to compete with sammy's high notes  and jump it was like might as well jump and it was like it would it sounded horrific it didn't sound  like the original song was even supposed to be sung like he could have done it the regular way maybe  he would have muddled through but he tried so hard to hit these high notes to try to compete with  sammy hagar sounded ridiculous really bad he's somebody that should just you know maybe just go  away all right do we have the review we're looking for it jim has the you have the jim has the uh 
[01:46:00]  rolling stone because it has ozzy on the cover oh yeah the second time in their disgraceful history  that put him on the cover it's been my uh bro bro bro bro magazine always sucks just so happens ozzy's on  the cover let's just keep it at that that's true van halen shows in the 80s is all about seeing eddie  that's true yeah cutting edge you know guitarist of the day so mike what's going on mike hello you  what's up yeah i said my name i don't think they're talking we're talking to you stupid dude dude this 
[01:46:30]  bit stinks you're not funny it's bad what do you want to say all right hey how'd it feel to get  punked out by phil anselmo opie what how'd it feel to get punked out by phil anselmo i don't think  he always punked out i don't think we got punked out that guy was hysterical man it was uh it was  a crap you're trying to do your little stick and phil was just like shut up that was shut the hell up  that's what made it funny idiot i was totally playing into him yeah right right yeah you were 
[01:47:00]  trying to play into him but he wasn't having none of it you know because the guy was on her when you  is this phil right now yeah no kidding huh is this phil everyone said that was that that was like 20 30  minutes of really good cringe radio funny of course he was saying yeah it was you it was you cringing  because phil wasn't having any of it he wasn't having any of what sir if i may ask you and you  probably won't give me a good answer but what wasn't he having any of any of your stupid little stick 
[01:47:30]  they were trying to pull on him we were trying to like make fun of him and he was like like anyone  had to make fun of thing like anyone had to make fun of phil don't you think he was really having a  great time and and people were laughing anyway and and he had and he had he had all of it mike  because if he's real if he wasn't having a good time he would have walked away from us he sat there  for 40 minutes he was enjoying himself he was smiling dude dude i was sitting right next to him he was  enjoying himself freaking funeral hey dude he was enjoying himself i understand  you're defending him because you like him but he was having a good time he was having a good time 
[01:48:00]  and i was playing right up to it i was i was even saying stuff like hey you and i uh are pretty  similar in nature of course we're not we're on we're on yeah yeah two sides of the spectrum like  what similar like what yeah he's oh yeah i do drugs yeah what drugs do you do uh none mike i think  you're really stupid he's repeating the stuff that was really funny yeah when phil did it you are  stupid and you probably have the iq of a flea because you didn't get it of course i can't compete with a  phil uh with phil from pantera you asked that's what made it so funny i'm like wow hey phil me 
[01:48:30]  and you are very similar i used to do drugs and i i copped and admitted i had smoked a little dope  and did maybe a line or two in the 80s this guy uh uh shot up just before he came to our table you  ass mike you're the guy that didn't get the mic you're the guy that didn't get the joke don't  worry about it you didn't get it you didn't get it everyone everyone got it you sat there because  you're so effing stupid you just didn't get it but that's okay some people don't get the joke you  should work on your intelligence you tried to run you tried to run your little joke on him and then 
[01:49:00]  you backpedaled after he called you out on joke on him it was guys sitting around laughing you don't  like to see him as you don't realize he's an entertainer man you're looking at him like he's  this this hard rock dude he's just an entertainer man he was i know that stupid but he was having  fun i know why you're calling i shot right next to him you didn't get the joke mike he was having a good  time when everyone left even at the end of it i totally admit i'm like wow he was pretty goddamn  intimidating i was pretty scared yeah i wasn't faking anything you ass you were so scared i wasn't 
[01:49:30]  faking anything you dick mike you didn't get mike mike we were talking about his overdose and how he was  dead and stuff and i looked him right in the face i go well i'm so glad you got you got the hint and you  got yourself together finally when it was so obvious i was making fun of him you didn't sure mike mike you  were so scared to make fun of him yeah we knew at any moment he was gonna smash a freaking bottle on your  hey mike stop with the image stop mike we got we got video of him we'll put it up on foundrymusic.com  you tell me if he was able to hit me over the head with a bottle you jack off hey mike the guy 
[01:50:00]  the guy couldn't move they had five guys walk him down to his seat for the interview you jerk  dude he couldn't walk you see him on hey wow that's so impressive that's so impressive he's always  like that and i thought he was great yeah it is mike you know what mike mike mike to carry on you're an  ass it'll also be really impressive when he ods in the next couple years yeah he's going down he was  out of his mind that's sad that's something to look up to him as great as he is he's one of the best 
[01:50:30]  rockers that ever lived of course mike right that's why rand staley died of course i was in chains to one  of the best rock bands that ever lived all right he died but dude you're you just you didn't get the  you didn't get the joke that's what's annoying right you have no intelligence you just didn't get  it you're like you're simple-minded it's okay do you think that arnold schwarzenegger is really a  robot you stupid ass it's part of a performance al pacino is not really a cuban drug dealer either  i'm sorry childlike adoration i thought i was bad at least i realized aziz has a sense of humor mike  you don't hold yourself relax it's too bad and the other thing dude we don't play it every way 
[01:51:00]  every time sometimes you know we'll go right after a celebrity or something other times you know what  he gets he gets his shots in and we'll play it another way and what made it funny was that he  is a hard rocker that's what made if it was george michael it wouldn't have been as funny the fact  that hope was doing that and he's a hard rocker heroin addict made it funny because of the difference  i can't believe i'm explaining the anatomy of a joke to a retarded man that's what i didn't see any  humor at all because you're an idiot because you're an idiot know how many laughs you know how many laughs 
[01:51:30]  you got on that interview i got the video he would tell he would talk about burning down his house  because he was pissed off at his sister one day and i'm like hey phil you know there was a time i  lit a little fire in the back uh with my brothers with little army soldiers and stuff i'm just like  you obviously i'm not and that was the joke you dick you're an idiot he's the guy it was a really  dumb joke you know what you are you're a pennsylvania hick you're an amish annoying aggravating 
[01:52:00]  man and you didn't know i'm not shut up stupid jersey lived there all my life what part of jersey  patterson exactly you're an ass yeah yeah okay yeah mike's just gotta understand there are guys  that don't get the joke sometimes and that's mike he's the guy at the party that like everyone's  laughing and he's got to be like what was that what was that line that last one i didn't understand  a joke see that ain't funny what was that funny i don't laugh dude you make francine sound like 
[01:52:30]  steven hawkins you're an idiot dennis miller you're an idiot they're funny all right i laugh at your  show because sometimes you got offended because you got he got picked on just be honest don't be  disney i was annoyed at ope because he said something i didn't like it's cool be honest  yeah honest you're annoyed because the guy you like got picked on just tell the truth  don't try to sidestep it and be clever tell the truth yeah but the whole the whole point of it is 
[01:53:00]  is that we pulled him back on it oh my god we gave hope he didn't say nothing my can i ask you one  question please i didn't say nothing what are you doing i didn't say nothing i wasn't in hey ass i  wasn't in rare form but i got some really funny shots in i didn't say nothing the whole freaking  crowd around us was laughing their asses off because of some of the shots i tried every time  you tried he just totally shot you down that was what was funny about it there's no explain why are  we explaining thank you my what an idiot i just wanted to know what he did for a living that would 
[01:53:30]  have been like sorry i'm sure it was i had no voice to begin with and what an idiot we're not he kept  getting you shut up stupid that was the joke there it's ridiculous trying to explain that to uh  somebody like him that guy felt was great we we took jabs at him and he he jabbed back that's what  was so funny and then to act like yeah we're possibly on the same level with the guy that  obviously shot up with something he he he admitted uh that he was on methadone but you know what 
[01:54:00]  in my uh humble opinion that was no methadone we were checking out on uh friday unless he was  double dosing when he came over where he could he i mean he looked at he looked like the dude from  uh weekend at bernie's yeah he looked like a dead corpse that they just were held up and and got to  the seat he was dead for four minutes right here's some of uh pantera's uh pantera phil's uh little  sound bites from friday anthony yeah i'm a long long long long time alcoholic and i i 
[01:54:30]  you know i'll figure at this point i ought to be what you call picky he was he wasn't happy with  the beer we get picky i want one in the green bottle he was saying right he wanted the green  bottle beer something tells me if none was available he'd have taken the brown bottle oh  yeah we're uh pantera phil how old the guy are you man what how old the guy

[01:57:30]  idea we were saying half this crap to him he's giving me the look of death  i don't know quite how to look at you sir  that's funny all right we'll get more phil clips hopefully later on in the show we better take a  break yeah we are going to get to some things today i don't know exactly what but uh we'll see

[02:12:30]  drives me nuts i got i got checked uh going uh to buffalo and coming back from buffalo and i'm  you know something i said this about a week or two ago i said i don't care check me because you know  something i'm an italian i'm sicilian you know i got the goatee the facial hair i could be a terrorist  yeah i could be a terrorist pull me aside i'm you know something it used to be really bad before 
[02:13:00]  you uh cut all your hair oh before i cut my hair i know it was frightening that they ever let me on  an aircraft but uh they they took my bags on the way in my checked luggage i go to check it the bag  that's going to go in the bottom of the plane and he goes oh come with me they go to a room put the  bag in there and proceed to just go through the whole thing they do that with like every hundredth  person or something i was the hundredth person there and back lucky me i should play lotto 
[02:13:30]  so they're going through everything you know all the dirty clothes on the way back and uh  i'm fine with it you know i'm looking i got there early enough where it's not affecting me i don't  have things to do so uh i sat there make small talk with i get the rubber gloves on going through your  crap going through everything what's what's here what's this what are they holding up your uh  s stained underwear and stuff that's my shoeshine rag please leave that in there please do feel  violated but you realize this has to be done but they would have never done this a few years ago  let's try 10 months ago my electric uh razor thing it's in a plastic uh a ziploc bag in the bag in 
[02:14:00]  another bag and they take that out they take the batteries out they work the shaver it's like they're  looking through everything which is fine like i said you know check me i'm fine with it someone like  ben ben got his bags ripped apart take the shoes off why are they checking ben  i'll tell you why because he has that big beautiful lump in the front of his jeans and  they think he's smuggling another little man in there 
[02:14:30]  he's got some dynamite in his pants oh you just reminded me of something so guess who's on our  plane back from uh buffalo of all places spotted him i was the one now as i'm getting checked i'm  getting checked they're they're going through uh now i they went through my check bag so now i don't  even have any carry-on but they tell me when i right before i'm ready to go down the jetway oh  you we're checking you i'm like all right i'll get checked again fine so they they wand me they go  over the wand i got to take my shoes off so as i'm now tying my shoes to put them back on i look over 
[02:15:00]  and i see this elderly gentleman walking with a guitar case and no one is stopping him so i look  at him and i go i know who that is that's that's uncle jr from the soprano from the sopranos he walks  right by i'm bypassing security tony i got my guitar case tony they don't check me because i got  the big c they feel bad i got a pass from dr kennedy tony he walks right by and i'm like oh my god it's  uncle june jr from the sopranos he walks by and ben starts laughing because he goes oh my god jim is 
[02:15:30]  just gonna freak out he's gonna want a picture because he was johnny ola from uh the god she was  johnny ola showed me johnny ola showed me it's johnny ola in godfather 2 you know great great  movie and and there he is so of course norton is going to want a picture i gotta ask uh jim some  were you plotting the whole flight how you were going to get a picture of him all i'm looking at  because he was way in the front we're in the back i was sitting right behind you and i'm thinking i 
[02:16:00]  think he's trying to figure out exactly how he's going to get this picture taken my i'm annoyed  because my bag because it's a smaller plane my camera's in my bag which they make you check even  though it's a carry-on bag because it's a 51 seat or whatever they make you put it under the plane  because it's a smaller plane yeah it was a little jet i'm like do i have to open my uh bag on the  runway to get my camera out because i have my laptop i was so annoyed you start opening your  bag on the runway that's i know they're gonna have a big problem i know and especially taking pictures  out on the runway yeah they probably wouldn't enjoy that either jim so he is on the flight back he's 
[02:16:30]  just like got a camera got a camera steve got a camera rick you got a camera anybody get a camera camera  camera it's all he was doing the entire flight back trying to plot how he was going to get his  picture how he's going to pull a hit on uncle june and then did you see him run off the plane yeah oh  yeah he's cutting everyone that's where i want to pick up the story all right so uh i go to the men's  room all right and i'm at the urinal and jim walks in i'm like oh here we go again you know he's behind 
[02:17:00]  me because you know the uh the men's bathroom really packed so people are waiting to you know  do their business you gotta pick so he's right behind me he's breathing really really hard and  i'm like oh my god here's his new gag like he's that is funny you just get behind someone like like  he's like he's looking at my my ass and he's breathing real hard i'm like i can't i'm like  because you never know what his new gag's gonna be i'm like oh my this is his new gag yeah he's just like  out of breath right and just when i was gonna say dude stop or whatever you know try to play my 
[02:17:30]  way out of it which never works i always end up the embarrassing guy uh he finally said i got the  picture with uh you know uh uncle junior i guess what he did was he was sprinting through the airport  like oj to dominic chenise to get this guy right yeah i was walking you were so out of shape when you  went to the men's room dude i was walking up the steps and i saw him and i'm like is your name dominic  and he goes yes i'm like oh i want to get a picture with you but i happen to walk ahead of 
[02:18:00]  him i don't know how it worked because he's an older gentleman i walked ahead get him away from  me where's bacala bacala supposed to protect me i burst past everybody up that little runway into  the uh terminal excuse me pardon me excuse me pardon me and i get there i open the camera bag i get the  camera ready he walks by me i'm like where's somebody from the show so i see uncut rick come out and i'm  like i i'm like uh dude you gotta get the picture and rick and credit to rick man was absolutely  professional he knew what he was doing of course he does he's mr rick he's good man mr rick knew  did he make dominic put his arms against the wall and prop his ass out now uh dominic could you uh 
[02:18:30]  unzip your pants and stick your hand down the front play with your bald head did you make him do the  britney spears no the al bundy the al bundy pose where they open their pants and stick their hand down  there dude he was so annoyed because rick goes oh he's got the guitar case and a bag in the other hand  and i'm like i'm walking my gosh do you mind if i get the picture with you and he's like well do you have  the camera and i'm like yeah and so we just stopped and you should just see what a little  pudgy nerd i look like leaning in next to this actor it was great it was classic i got no glare 
[02:19:00]  in the window behind you to freak you out i got photoshopped all right i gotta ask you guys something  because you know how i hate flying just like pretty much everyone does at this point who else felt like  we were heading right toward the uh empire state empire state building you felt it too absolutely did  i absolutely did we did not talk about this we haven't talked about my heart went into my gut  we cut a little swath uh we were landing at la guardia we came in we passed la guardia you know 
[02:19:30]  what we cut across central park can i stop you for a second yeah i think the air the airlines have to  do everyone a service like especially the locals we all know where la guardia airport is it is east of  manhattan okay we are coming in from the east all right we passed the airport at that point i think  they owe us after 9 11 to say hey you know what uh because of you know traffic whatever we're going  to take a loop it's the pattern that's the way they run it but they need to tell us now because  yeah that that's been the thing they've done forever but after 9 11 you know what i was effing 
[02:20:00]  freaked out and i i was thinking to myself this is exactly what the people were thinking on the plane  going uh why are we taking this pattern now why are we continuing you know uh uh through manhattan  like that yeah but anyways continue it cuts across um yeah central park and then he turns a little to  the left to bring you down uh the uh the hudson river and we were low so we were really low which 
[02:20:30]  was weird and what were you thinking at that point i was thinking wow this is a great view of manhattan  it was great really beautiful yeah yeah who else was thinking for some reason we're landing i've  landed there enough times where i know that's the pattern then they bring you next to newark  then you loop over by the verrazano bridge up across brooklyn and then back up north point  of the airport we passed la guardia now we're over manhattan okay now we're west of manhattan and way  west of the airport airport so i'm thinking what the f is going on okay then we're so low i'm thinking 
[02:21:00]  something is wrong at la guardia and we're landing at at newark which is you know south of manhattan  obviously for everyone listening elsewhere and then he made a sharp left turn and now we are facing  manhattan island and dead straight ahead is the empire state bill and dude i've never been more  scared in my life flying i'm not kidding and you felt it too right absolutely did i i didn't know if  we were high enough we were very close to a thousand or twelve hundred feet we weren't that high  no i've been hired not knowing it we're really low but i really thought like wow man this this 
[02:21:30]  could be and that didn't frighten me for some reason because we weren't that close to the building but  no we were in the in the pattern that they have set up because you got three major airports there so  they they run you around a lot i've been running around but it this one was just a little different  weird thing we were a little too low and you see just that gaping hole of uh that's what it was  ground zero everyone went to the left side of the plane to take a look i turned that way yeah and then uh  we when we loop around the lower manhattan you were had a perfect view of the ditch uh at the 
[02:22:00]  world trade like two teeth missing yeah right it was the weirdest thing i've never seen it from  above except for you know photos we weren't that high but to see it like like we did it was it was  phenomenal i was sea blocking some guy because it just like he annoyed me so much he was with his  dumb wife and his khaki shorts and his good tan and we went with we were the first right he goes oh  there's a ground zero and i just immediately wanted him dead like you tourist sea sucker so  we're coming around and now it's on my side and i could see his stupid perfectly coiffed hair 
[02:22:30]  straining to look out my window look again what a blocker i was i got my fat little chinless head  in the window i'm drinking my big bottle of water anything to block his view classic scumbag where were  you nine months ago now you decide to show up i really got annoyed i am so glad you felt the same thing  i i was freaked and then i mean then they make the sharp left back to la guardia i mean that was an  awful landing oh really i thought so yeah that was a bad landing because then all of a sudden there 
[02:23:00]  was a sharp left banking turn we were not that high off the ground i like that stuff man that's  like fighter pilot it was a small little jet it was a nice plane yeah but when we hit the runway you  could feel the plane was kind of on one wheel on the left and it was holding that for a few seconds  how was the landing in buffalo with that old plane that one's up too when you get a crosswind you got  to do that and then at the last minute you could straighten it out or else you're gonna blow up the  side of the runway thank god i'm not flying for a while it doesn't bother me landing man i'm never 
[02:23:30]  afraid of landing just when i thought i could handle some of this stuff because we had a discussion about  flying last week yeah they pull this facing manhattan and and the empire state building i am so done  now that was a great view it was great oh that's what i was thinking at first when when we're looping  around because all i'm thinking is ah we have to land at newark which is awfully close to you know  la guardia i'm thinking all right that something's going on with the air traffic we're going to newark  but when he made that left turn and we were facing uh man like that forget it you know when i knew  that's wrong we were i was i lost it i knew we were lower than normal because when we swung around uh 
[02:24:00]  brooklyn after the the very like by the verrazano i turned i looked and saw the balcony my balcony on  my building come on i am not kidding you i know exactly where it is because i got a baseball field  and whatnot so i i looked i found my building and saw my balcony and i'm like we're usually higher  than this were there two black guys they're taking stuff out that would be great sticking furniture 
[02:24:30]  hey hey you hey you down there  hey sean what's going on oh hey hey bro how's it going good i just wanted to tell you guys well first  off let me tell you this i'm watching playboys erotic seduction yeah and after saturday in  buffalo yeah i am so disappointed that's why we didn't go to the strip club we ruined it for  ourselves we decided if we go to a strip club in buffalo we're not going to see anything near what  we saw no no you might have seen it that in canada because i i've actually seen close to that 
[02:25:00]  not really what i've seen there that was that was amazing guys i do have we're not going to forget  that party anytime soon it's easily the the top five of parties me and a friend of mine have video  you know how you guys were talking about the uh the events of all the guys surrounding the girls  inside the volleyball court yeah i was dead center in that spot and i got video of the whole thing  and man let me tell you a lesbian orgy going on right in the sand it was amazing they're cleaning  sand out of places uh for the last day or so hey norton great norton i i i talked to you i was the 
[02:25:30]  the guy that tried to convince you to let me get in with the big wow signs we also had a couple of  huge wow signs well we're gonna have a lot of video up on foundrymusic.com so uh steve is still  working on the osfest stuff we had a very busy few days well yeah keep in contact if you guys want  me to give you some of that tape for steve to put on there we got some really good tape we encourage  uh that you send everything to foundrymusic.com all i can say is i got about we took about three  hours of tape and two of it is usable awesome stuff there is some stuff up on buffalo thong.com yeah 
[02:26:00]  i heard about that we're not associated with that website but uh some guy took 200 at least 200  pictures and he put them up on the on this website and it uh gives you a taste of what was going on  on saturday in buffalo well anthony was looking at some of these pictures and saying oh i'm sorry  go ahead go ahead sean i'm sorry if you guys ever need like if if you ever see you my signs we got the  big trouble yeah you got your losses man uh anthony was saying that he was seeing some of these 
[02:26:30]  pictures on buffalo fun.com and then you were wondering where did this i said i'm looking  going where was this happening i'm seeing like uh girl on girl hot girl on girl action i'm seeing  gas shots jimmy get your goddamn hand off my hand that worked like a charm tim sabian was so creeped  out yeah yeah yeah it was hilarious but jimmy's one of his new gags is to when you come over like  he'll come over to see the pictures i'm looking at on my computer here on on at this uh studio and 
[02:27:00]  he'll put his hand on my hand and lean over and just start looking at the uh computer screen right  like there's nothing wrong that his hand is on my hand and and with people he doesn't know like  or the people that aren't familiar with his gag like tim sabian uh at oz fest was standing right  next to uh jim jim like uh tim's got his hands on his hips you know superman superman taking a leak  style and jim just cradles he puts his arm right there on on tim's forearm and just stands there 
[02:27:30]  and tim doesn't know what to do like you don't immediately go don't touch me because you want to  know yeah is he going to move it but he doesn't the best is when you start talking to somebody  because it's natural just like when you go like like oh dude i wanted to ask you if you had this  thing and you grab the guy's arm to get his attention and you turn away you're done with the  conversation but you don't let go that's right now you're staring off in another direction and you're  still holding the guy's arm yeah you just have a gently gently a gentle hold it's very uncomfortable  the hold of a lover so don't do it all right uh yeah it's hardcore pornography by the way on this 
[02:28:00]  website by the way speaking of um wow and all that uh nice segue thanks uh scott colombo our internet  guy yeah for the wow contest is on vacation yeah so he is so now what pretty much screwed up our contest  for the next week uh you could qualify all this week for the wow contest friday is absolutely the  last day to qualify friday for the wow contest five thousand dollars up for grabs courtesy of  brisketvideo.com we have a a ton of new contestants up on op and anthony.com you know something i'm just

[02:29:00]  not around oh what a mess vegas you crapped out on this contestant ugh so you know but just qualify  and we'll figure it out so we'll probably take like a a break as far as the on-air portion of the  contest goes because uh scott's not around to help us out all right yeah but you can qualify until  friday i've said it three times so ladies do not email me just go down to your your uh local station  and get in the contest it's not too late friday is it friday friday friday is it to qualify thank you 
[02:29:30]  all right um anthony before we take a break i want to thank uh the new york audience and the  surrounding areas we had one of our biggest ratings uh book ever ever ever that's it uh still number one  where we're supposed to be number one oh yeah uh by by leaps and bounds and bounds um uh the the  they're saying the highest ratings ever in these uh male categories they're saying the highest ever  with the closest person uh next down the closest show next being uh half half of the ratings we 
[02:30:00]  have yeah we had a tremendous book tremendous let's have a rally to that  to all those ass munches out there that said that syndication would hurt our show we're proving  that's not the case for all those idiots that said that you know showing hannity is the better  show oops i don't think so anymore ouch the whole 9 11 thing is uh oh be stopped with the 9 11 excuses 
[02:30:30]  you know the people making excuses if you looked at a graph of programming through the past year  and saw the changes that happened uh at 9 11 and then uh for the months afterwards it's so obvious how  the news stations the political uh news talk shows just went through the roof during that time and  people really were uh you know thank god we had our hardcore fans that were still listening to this  show because a lot of the people were like hey i want the news i want to know how the war's going i 
[02:31:00]  want to know if we're going to be bombed again or something but uh boy the listening habits have just  gotten right back to where they're supposed to be and we kicked shawty's ass oh yeah it needs to be  sad yeah because there's a bunch of critics out there see see shawty's the better show blah blah  we told you all shut up we don't think that the show is going to last in syndication rinse i think  that uh the problem is you faggot shut your face so you can read about it for yourself in the paper  tomorrow uh the other thing anthony yeah uh ron and fez are back from vacation they're on after us here 
[02:31:30]  in new york city call them they absolutely killed in the ratings they're number one men 25 to 44  they went through the roof in their ratings uh the other two day parts and we we still got some  work to do uh scott farrell did okay in mornings just okay he's uh he's moving in the right direction  so i just want to thank the new york audience and something that uh the papers will not report because  the this station new york wnaw has been the laughing stock of the market for many many years now ever 
[02:32:00]  since and i came back to town yes uh at this point and we said it a month ago anthony and it came true  this radio station wnaw from from 3 p.m to midnight is better than k-rock oh yeah by far we  kick k-rock's ass yeah from three to midnight now awesome kick their ass kick ass awesome yeah  hopefully the company will open their stupid eyes and realize some of this stuff 
[02:32:30]  mm-hmm we kill them from three to midnight it's not even close anymore  something they will yeah but what does that mean  for a station like any w i mean come on  that's great i think syndication has hurt the show syndication has hurt the show 
[02:33:00]  that's what it's all about and i think hannity is doing better and more successful remember people you  heard it here first rinse wrong again alan wrong again how many times we have to point out that  you're wrong but mom i want to stick to dentistry you ass i want to be a radio personality mom and  pursue my dream go to college young man all right you're castrating c thanks a lot for supporting me  i want to be a dentist wrong again alan wrong again 
[02:33:30]  ouch want to be a faggot ouch so there you have it unfortunately the media will not report that  we're a better station from three to midnight than k-rock but that's a huge accomplishment for this uh  this staff here at uh wnaw so congrats to everybody okay and stay tuned for what goes in middays  yeah we're still trying to figure that out huh yeah still working on that one  yumping yimini we'll get there i've heard some ideas i'd like to see a uh a uh a black personality 
[02:34:00]  really yes maybe our own earl with his black rock coalition show i would like to see that  or his public uh service show that he does on sunday i would like to see her i'll get a show  how about francine oh yes speaking of francine we might have to do that weekend review thing before  we get out of here today um anthony another clip from oz fest yeah as we go to break actually we got  a francine thing too so we got a couple uh short things we want to play before we hit the commercials  listen to me middays on wnaw um okay i was so proud of uh this little joke i put together at 
[02:34:30]  oh people have been requesting this on instant feedback i've been reading and people requesting  opi's joke and uh i must say anthony hung me out to dry this is great uh because i ran the joke by him  because i was so proud of myself yeah and uh and as i was saying it live backstage at oz fest i knew  i effed up really bad because i could see on jim's face jim's face lit up he saw a limping gazelle and 
[02:35:00]  he was a lion on the serengeti you were a chick with no self-esteem and i realized you had like the  memento memory so you couldn't testify and i knew there was no nothing i could do to get out of it  basically we we took this bus to oz fest yeah and i was with jim and he was so excited we all know the  ozzy thing by now you know and i was thinking to myself uh just play the clip i know anyway yeah 
[02:35:30]  well i was supposed to say mark david chapman and i said john hinkley of course i basically was  thinking you know oh forget it i can't even say it anymore i ruined the joke forever but here's how  it went down friday on the way over to the venue i gotta say it's getting back to uh norton and his  obsession about you know the ozzy obsession yeah he was so fidgety and freaking on the bus because  we're getting closer to the venue which means closer to ozzy yeah i swear to you dude i i felt like i was  on the bus with john hinkley taking him to the dakota that would have been probably really appropriate 
[02:36:00]  if hinkley had shot john levin you asked why was he going you dick  i gotta rewrite that one mark david chapman whatever i'm so happy  you just made norton stay and i hope he's belting him with various markers and whatnot  and i just turned so red i i was so happy that's funny it was the first joke i've written in about  a week i was so proud of it i was practicing on the bus hinkley standing there going when's reagan 
[02:36:30]  what are we doing here who's this faggot liberal in the glasses i don't want to talk to him  he would have to stay there for another year because it didn't happen well whatever i know  you're saying i felt like i was bringing i felt like you were bringing oswald to say the theater  where lincoln was watching the play yeah i know oh god mr president mr president yes what do you want  lifetime television for women presents portrait of an intern opian anthony intern francine confronts

[02:54:00]  well you get that out we should talk about uh mr uh american taliban american taliban  uh they he copped a deal that's what happened the guy copped a deal with uh prosecutors this guy  should have been shot if you ask me the guy's a uh a criminal he's a traitor and he uh he uh 
[02:54:30]  was shooting at americans he was he was brought in with grenades and whatnot the guy he picked his side  and he was caught and he should have been shot but for some reason we don't do that they offered him a  deal and they took it 20 years in prison you know what that means and i don't care if they said it's  guaranteed he's gotta serve out the entire 20 wrong uh this guy could be out in a little over 10 years 
[02:55:00]  for this he's a young guy so he could just get out talk shows books you just made the guy a mint  pretty much yep pretty much they just he's famous he's going to be rich when he gets out uh this has been  the best career move that this asswipe could have made i can only hope please we i don't know where  this guy is going to prison or anything but if if we broadcast any city that has the prison that that 
[02:55:30]  this guy is going to be in please i'm begging the inmates to give this man the slowest most painful  most degrading and humiliating death that you can ever imagine ever i'm talking the a sex  i'm talking just wads of manseed from multi-racial convicts all over this guy's body to mix with 
[02:56:00]  the blood as they they slowly carve him up please i'm begging you we'll give you a valuable prize  what do we got cds something i don't know but you gotta think he's not gonna last in prison i would  hope so you always say that like you know when they do a child molesters do rarely last in prison  they get beat up jeffrey jeffrey dommer i know but you know something there's a way to get at  everybody that's if there's one thing history has proven that's true is uh you can assassinate  everyone make me peel my orange there's uh yeah there's ways to get and i can't see any american 
[02:56:30]  even if you're incarcerated that wouldn't love to have the celebrity the notoriety that i'm the guy that  killed this scumbag traitor yeah but for some reason the prosecution figured they'd give him a  deal uh 20 years he could have gotten life in prison um he like i said he should have gotten death but  um they dropped eight charges eight charges he pled guilty to two charges uh which uh carried 10 years 
[02:57:00]  each you know they don't want to do the bottom line is he's a white suburban kid and i'm telling you  that they just didn't want that they just want to get it over with and move on it was one of the  middle class one of your own and he's guilty and he's getting no time for it it's disgraceful  here's uh here's uh he said um well we got clips from his mom his dad and his brother this is his  his words uh as he pled guilty i provided service as a soldier to the taliban last year i carried a 
[02:57:30]  rifle and two grenades uh adding that he knew to do so was illegal i plead guilty  uh what it was why why cut him a deal exactly you know something there are certain circumstances  where maybe it's iffy maybe you got the prosecution goes look we better cut a deal this is a great case  this would be great you try it and you put the guy away for life why cut a deal and we're certainly 
[02:58:00]  making a fine example for uh everyone else that wants to try this just look i get 10 years uh  if you could spend that's worth it people go to medical risk and spend upwards of 10 years attending  schools and whatnot uh residency to to become a doctor and not make half the money this son of a  bitch with a 10-year investment in his life he's how old is he 21 22 he's going to be in his early 
[02:58:30]  what 40s when he gets out if he spends his whole sentence which he's not gonna do and he's gonna be  rich you know ed makes a good point on the instant feedback the son of sam got 365 years right and he's  already up for parole or it just passed how are you up for parole if they give me a 365 year sentence  there are i know how they do it you don't have to answer me but it's just it's ridiculous there are  people in certain states that are spending a life prison term for drug possession with intent to sell 
[02:59:00]  charges i mean yeah you could argue all day about you know how evil he is and how horrible that but  but how could somebody selling weed or the three strikes rule where you commit three uh felonies  regardless of how intense those felonies were maybe they're not shootings maybe they're you know  white-collar crimes you do three of them you get automatic life why is this guy getting a 20-year 
[02:59:30]  prison term why did they make the deal something's going on he's again it really is he's a suburban  kid you know how people nobody likes to think of our own and that's one reason this bypasses all  that they want to get it out of the media and just move on with it they should have shot him justin  volpeg it's 30 years and he was a bad dirty cop he should go to prison 30 years and this guy betrays  his country and carries a weapon and grenades and gets 20 and it's argued that he killed that soldier  that was there in terror interrogating him when yeah when when uh the uh uprising happened 
[03:00:00]  you know i mean we're dumb americans are stupid see how quickly see it just takes almost a year  few months go by we forget things all of a sudden he's copping a deal do you know the outcry if it was  a week after september 11th and they were saying well we're going to give this guy a deal there'd be  an outcry where's the outcry this guy better end up dead he had so better end up dead in the most 
[03:00:30]  horrific way well here's uh some clips first we got his mom his little mom oh this family of his also  round him up and should be shot yep this decision today will give him an opportunity  to give back what he has so much to offer to the people and for the people and the world  yuck she's she's kidding right yeah what what she's kidding what is there to offer nothing 
[03:01:00]  here's uh daddy he never in all the interrogations that were going to be the subject of the suppression  hearing never once did john ever say anything against the united states never once not one  word john loves america and we love america god bless america you oh jesus christ i just let that sit  there just let that sit fighting for the taliban he sounded his statement sounded like norton with 
[03:01:30]  ozzy the guy's blind faith in his son see he yes he took up arms against america but that's the beauty  of it that's the beauty of my son that's the beauty of it you know i really don't like your  accurate comparison i'm an ass and i know it that's the beauty of it oh that's what the speculation is  he was able to provide info to the cia keep some u.s defense thing secret yeah you know something if 
[03:02:00]  maybe he uh gave them some info still doesn't still you know what if he if he if we're good regardless if  he helped catch guys that are involved in the higher echelons fine because he's not a threat  anymore he's still not fine he did it because now he was scared doesn't matter why if we help get  other people who are involved in terrorism should do that and then kill him i was going to say and  then we don't do that take him out back and finally anthony here's his brother i love him i've always  been proud of him i'm so proud of him he's behaved with total integrity total grace it pains me that he's 
[03:02:30]  going to be away for so long but i'm grateful still for for this decision hopefully it'll pain his  a even more dude if you're thinking i mean like opie would say i mean he's the biggest trader  of this country since tom arnold  we're gonna go bro you're so gonna go man you're a dick the family is completely delusional 
[03:03:00]  the brother always been proud of him shut up rick how are you proud of the brother  we're trying to have a serious discussion here do you understand how are you proud of your brother  he said he's always been proud of him that he's a trader for this country  it's not like he's writing patty duke themed uh parodies  like brothers should be doing the guy picked up arms against this country and now he gets 20 years 
[03:03:30]  somebody commented that uh in prison he's going to be holding some uh big black guy's rifle and  grenades in his hand too which is really good i your name slips me but very good we can dream can  we i'm hoping the convicts man because there's certain codes they have bank robbery drug dealing  and stuff is one thing yeah murder but there's just certain crimes that they don't want to be  around molestation child molestation they they jeffrey dommer got taken out i heard that had 
[03:04:00]  nothing to do with that though i heard believe it or not burned lover no i heard dommer actually um  cut somebody on a food line and that was a quote unquote diss in jail and they killed him for that's  what i heard cut in the food do you love the joint love isn't it great the justice that goes on in the  joint dudes man they really are and he's you you've seen this guy when he they shaved him all up and  everything got that swimmer's taliban body it's gonna be all over for him yeah i mean that kid lynn  has quite a build on him i'm not gay and i don't like traitors but boy if i was both ways i'd be 
[03:04:30]  the one i went with the white supremacist like an oz oh my god schillinger gets a little word out  there in the yard maybe he's in the weight room you know what they do right they turn him over  then pin his back down his shoulder blades with one of the heavy weights get his legs down with the  other way so he really can't move spread him oh you like that don't you don't you faggot oh i like  that weight oh yeah before you know it he's uh he's in the weight room getting uh getting it and here

[03:18:00]  republicans in this country are talking to the people that run sesame street the children's  television workshop and telling them we we aren't going to stand for uh this happening on american  sesame street the little aids muppet an aids muppet how the hell you portray that little fuzzy sarcomas  all over them i mean what what's an aids puppet the aids muppet look like how about the poor guy 
[03:18:30]  that has to shove his fist in the operator wow that glove on your hand very good yeah but they're  all freaked out now because uh either way i could give a crap what the hell's on sesame street i don't  have kids but for some reason the um a lot of the right-wing people are very upset about something  like this and think it would be harmful for the children to have a aids puppet  hiv puff and stuff hey that's pretty good i don't think it's harmful but why have they do they have 
[03:19:00]  a cancer muppet it's just politically correct why do they have a cancer you know why because in south  africa uh aids is running rampant yeah it is like like if you want to have a muppet that the kids can  relate to have the aids muppet because they all got it or have a white muppet living in a much better  place than a black muppet south africa stinks they should fix their racial problems  i think they did didn't they get rid of the apartheid yeah i don't even know they took care

[03:20:30]  yeah  come in my  okay  on my way to where the  is  I don't know what you're saying.  Don't tell me how to get, how to get to the B-O-C-E stream.  Christopher Street.  Call that plane. 
[03:21:00]  All over my back.  A-O-K.  I'm losing weight rapidly.  No one will talk to me anymore.  How about a nice bucket of A?  Can you tell me how to get, how to get to the B-O-C-E stream?  I can't think of anything funny because I have the improv skills of a Down syndrome patient.  How to get to the B-O-C-E stream.  How'd you get through Texas' street?  Wait, what?  Exactly.  We had nothing there.  Sorry. 
[03:21:30]  Awful.  Suck.  Quadriplegic sue a strip club.  I got the story.  Whatever.  West Palm Beach, a quadriplegic has sued a strip club charging that it violates the Americans with Disabilities Act because the lap dance room does not have wheelchair access.  Ah, the lap dance room doesn't have the access.  All right, now it's making sense.  Edward Law of Orlando sued the wild side adult sports cabaret last month.  We should get this guy on the phone.  Chicken ass.  He went there on May 9th and June 14th and he couldn't get into the lap dance area, Anthony. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  The lap dance room is only accessible by a short flight of stairs, according to the suit.  And it also alleges that the counter around the stage where strippers dance is too high to...  No, that means your view's better, idiot.  Right.  Making it difficult for Law to see the stage and set down his drinks, Anthony.  But doesn't everybody sit?  Of course.  Well, I guess his wheelchair's a little lower than that.  A little lower?  Well, get a freaking phone book or something.  This is why everybody is sick of special interest groups.  And it's like, dude, you're talking about people with real disabilities and this guy's complaining because he can't get a lap dance? 
[03:22:30]  I mean, am I going to sue all women because I'm not bangable?  Get over it.  Don't be crippled.  This is one of those goofy lawsuits that they have to deal with and some ass lawyer will take the case.  Oh, they'll pick it up.  Remember the guy that sued Hooters because they only hired women to be in those little skimpy outfits?  And he went to court because he wanted to be a Hooters guy.  Right.  And the court system had to take this guy seriously?  This is an industry that is high profit and knows about ADA and is ignoring it. 
[03:23:00]  His attorney, oh, he already has an attorney, told the South Florida paper, I have no sympathy for them violating ADA.  Right.  I really hope, I'm sorry.  Go, go, go, go.  I would say I would hope this guy is really fat too so Southwest can throw him off the plane.  Did you see the fat family that couldn't get on the plane?  I laughed all weekend long.  Those two fat dopes that had to drive 1,300 miles because they can't stop shoving food into their faces.  Let that be a lesson to you.  Good.  That's what you get.  He's seeking a lot of money.  I can't stop eating. 
[03:23:30]  This idiot also, he's just going around suing people.  He recently filed ADA lawsuits against an Orlando restaurant and a Daytona Beach Harley-Davidson motorcycle shop.  What is he suing at the Harley place?  He declined to comment on those cases.  He can't ride a motorcycle.  And what is there to see there that you can't see from the comfort of your stinky wheelchair?  If I ever see him, he'll be suing me for holding his head and putting my junk in his mouth forcefully. 
[03:24:00]  He used my mouth like a woman.  More frivolous lawsuits.  All right.  Well, we can talk about Ann Landers.  Oh, that's a great story.  Dead Ann Landers, by the way.  Until July 27th, when our final column appears, we are reading dead Ann Landers.  Who knew this?  She died.  What?  June 22nd.  I believe Ann Landers, the original Ann Landers, died. 
[03:24:30]  But she still gives advice from the grave.  It's kind of creepy.  It's really creepy.  This is another story where I got to say, is it a hoax or is it just Ann Landers' column getting a little more risque, trying to get a little titillating to attract an audience, aside from just the basic recipe and manners.  There's, you know what, advice that she gives.  Yes?  I think we're blowing it as far as our show goes.  Why?  Because this is going to open up a whole can of worms and people are going to be able to comment and call like crazy. 
[03:25:00]  Is that bad?  Well, it'll give us material tomorrow.  Oh, my God.  People are going to kill you.  All right.  Well, read the story.  But, guys, don't forget about this one and call tomorrow.  Okay.  Two days ago.  Two days ago, I saw a rig that'll hold that tanker.  I caught my 12-year-old son, John, in parentheses, and then they used the M-word, Opie. 
[03:25:30]  Wow.  They used the M-word for taking care of yourself.  Right.  As a guy, you know, the jack move.  Two days ago, I caught my 12-year-old son, John, doing himself.  Now, we've talked about that in the past.  As the mom's walking in on the sons, it happened to our own little Jimmy Norton, and it's very embarrassing.  This has a little twist.  Caught him, taking care of himself, 12-year-old son.  He was with another boy who was doing the same thing. 
[03:26:00]  At 12?  At 12.  They're sitting around doing it?  A couple of 12-year-olds just sitting around jacking.  They had a girl in the middle and said they'd flip a coin.  The loser has to F her.  King me of Caroline's.  I was so shocked, I walked back into the house without saying a word.  Where was she?  She walked back into the house.  Where were these two?  Yeah, where were these two?  In the shed out back, probably.  Oh, maybe in the shed out back. 
[03:26:30]  Were they in the tree house?  In the tree house.  And was one kid snoring very loudly?  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, 
[03:27:00]  You know, we don't like explaining things over and over again, but...  That happened to me on California.  Yeah, just real fast.  Ann had a friend.  He had no clue the friend was gay.  No, because we were kids at the time.  12, 13, they had a sleepover in a tree fort.  We were sleeping out in the treehouse.  And that's when Anthony's friend came on to him and said he would do what he would...  Exactly. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  And that's when Anthony pretended to be asleep.  Was asleep.  Like, because it was just, it was going on where it was like, all right, it's very late.  We'd already had the, you know, snuck the beers and whatnot, you know, and it was just, it was time, I was tired, it's time to crap out.  So I'm like, laying there, waiting to fall asleep, and I hear, Anthony, Anthony, do you want a job?  And I just lay there like, maybe you won't notice I'm not asleep yet. 
[03:28:00]  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  Anthony, Anthony.  I'll suck you.  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  Wah.  Whee.  Boop, boop, boop, boop.  That is one of my faves.  So maybe they were in the tree fort.  These two kids and them.  Yeah. 
[03:28:30]  I walked back into the house without saying a word.  She caught her 12-year-old and another kid, a 12-year-old kid jacking.  That evening, my husband and I had a talk with our son.  John said this behavior had been going on for several months.  Apparently, a 12-year-old neighbor boy talked them into it.  Talked them into it.  So now we're talking, if the 12-year-old neighbor talked them into it, then there was another one involved.  No.  Me and John had been talking about it, and the neighbor said we should do it. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah.  Apparently, a 12-year-old neighbor boy talked them into it.  I told my son.  I told my son that he should not let anyone else touch his private area.  But he insisted that no one was touching him.  He was only touching himself.  John's body is maturing, and he is more developed than the other boys his age. 
[03:29:30]  She found that one out.  Did old mom give you the two-fist test?  You're stacking up quite nice there, Johnny.  Nice.  John, I'd like to sit you down and tell you you have a big...  Bigger than your father's.  Got a huge mule for 12.  Big 12-year-old mule.  Will this ruin him for life?  Please tell me now how to deal with this upset in Kansas. 
[03:30:00]  What did the dead-end lander say?  Dead Ann Landers says she is dead.  I spoke with William J. Piper, M.D., a child psychoanalyst.  He said taking care of yourself is a normal experience of childhood and adolescence,  and there's no evidence that is harmful in any way.  It is not unusual for two 12-year-olds to take care of each other in each other's presence.  However, Dr. Piper suggests you speak to John, in a non-critical manner, of course, 
[03:30:30]  and emphasize that taking care of oneself is a private experience, not a social one.  Yeah, sure.  Just ask Jim.  Let John know that taking care of oneself privately shows more respect for his developing,  and apparently quickly developing, body.  The most important thing is to tell him you love him no matter what.  Even if she walked in and found him bent over with that other kid saying,  So that's the Ann Landers. 
[03:31:00]  Like I said, I don't even know if these are real anymore.  Speaking of checking out another man's mule, Ben's little story from Buffalo.  What happened, Ben?  We were at Chef's, a great restaurant there in Buffalo,  and I went to use the bathroom after everyone was trying to send me into the kitchen to go to the bathroom. 
[03:31:30]  And there was a guy and a chef, you know, he's obviously a chef in the men's room,  and, you know, the restaurant's great, so I say, hey, nice food or whatever.  And he comes over and just stares right at my thing.  And then he starts talking, and I knew he wasn't, you know, all there.  Oh, was he retarded?  Yeah.  Wow.  He was a trainable.  Oh, he was a trainable.  He was definitely a trainable.  Did you reach over and put your hand on his back like in that video clip from the trainable? 
[03:32:00]  Dude, I didn't even know what to do.  Because then he was just standing right there, and I'm like, Jesus.  So I stopped, and I'm like, dude.  And then I proceeded to bring him out and tell him that it was Norton's birthday.  Did we ever put that video clip up on Foundry Music?  Yeah, I think that did go up.  Yep.  Really?  Yeah.  I hope Steve's listening.  You should put it up there.  I forgot all about it.  That is one of the funniest pieces of video ever.  Yeah.  Wow.  This guy was one of the funniest guys ever.  He was totally scrambled eggs.  What a complete idiot.  Was he standing behind you, breathing heavy, saying you just got a picture with Uncle Junior? 
[03:32:30]  No?  His name was, what was his name?  Dilbert.  Dilbert.  Dilbert.  Dilbert.  And then he came out and managed to talk to everyone.  He was a nice guy.  The guy was nice.  Oh, he was real nice.  Staring at Ben's mule.  That's hilarious.  He was in the urinal being all herky-jerky trying to get out of there.  I was just trying to be nice.  You know, I was just...  Don't I get it?  All right.  Here's a clip from the Trainable video.  We play this from time to time.  The mother walking in on the sun.  This is great.  It's like an instructional video. 
[03:33:00]  Right.  What to do if you catch your trainable taking care of himself.  Yeah.  Many people believe that important elements of sex education are social behavior and responsibilities.  Social acceptability involves being comfortable with one's own sexuality.  Oh, excuse me, Ricky. 
[03:33:30]  Ricky, I did see what you were doing.  It felt good, didn't it?  It's all right.  We all have feelings like this sometimes.  I'm just glad you're doing this in the privacy of your own room.  When you're a little bit older, we'll have to talk more about these feelings and what causes them and how we can control these feelings. 
[03:34:00]  I'm sorry I intruded on your privacy.  I'll be sure not next time.  Okay?  Oh, there's a little Todd laying in bed.  This manner of response frees the child of guilt and assures him he is normal.  It opens communication between parent and child and introduces the concept of responsibility for his behavior.  The other clip's even creepier. 
[03:34:30]  You see the older guy catching the kid.  Let me see what's going on there, son.  Let me take a look at that big, retarded mule.  You ever hear the other one?  No.  Oh, God, it's even better.  That's got to be awful as a father to walk in and just see him and hear him and go, duh, duh.  Get Steve in here.  Why did I have a hanger after three months?  He's got to put the video clip up of the urinal thing. 
[03:35:00]  What to do if a gay guy puts his arm on your back while he's next to you in the urinal.  It's hilarious.  Oh, kid's sitting there in bed just drooling all over it.  Yeah, and he's doing it thinking of cake.  Ah, cake.  Hey, Steve, we ever put that video clip up on Foundry Music?  Which one?  The urinal thing with the two guys?  The retard and the other guy, and he puts his arm on the guy's back.  Yeah, yeah, that's been up there for a while, actually.  I put it up.  Can you put it back up to the top? 
[03:35:30]  Yeah, so people can check it out.  It's one of the funniest videos.  Just find a nuclear physicist to help them run you through foundrymusic.com.  No, I'm not scratching my head because of that.  But I'm trying to figure out when I actually put it up there.  Ah, because that'll make it easier to find.  How about if you hit the search thing?  You put trainables and then hit search.  That would actually work.  Yeah, but you know what?  We've got to make it very easy for our listeners.  Yes, right.  Steve will.  Hey, actually, this clip is the older man walks in after this kid has a wet dream.  Yeah, that was it.  He wakes up, he had a wet dream, and this older guy's kind of trying to teach the retard. 
[03:36:00]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Hey, Frank.  How come you haven't gotten up yet?  I'm wet and sticky.  Oh.  What, uh, when did that happen?  Did it happen during the night?  Or did it just happen now?  Do you know?  I don't know.  Well, if you're sticky, maybe it was a wet dream.  Do you know what a wet dream is?  Yeah.  Well, you know, how old are you now? 
[03:36:30]  You must be about...  Frank, I'm sure you understand now just what happened and, uh, that this is probably going 
[03:37:00]  to happen quite a few times more, like it does to everybody else, and it's quite normal,  right?  I think the best thing we can do now is to show you how to clean it up.  Oh, God.  Okay?  Okay.  Okay.  This is how you do it.  Um, um.  How horrid is that?  It's so disturbing.  Did it happen, uh, now or in the night?  I don't know.  Oh, God.  I think the real solution is that the father should have grabbed his mule with hot tongs 
[03:37:30]  and squeezed it really hard.  If you do that again, Santa will never bring you another present, you dope.  If you do that again in the night, I'm going to kill your mommy.  I'm going to hurt her.  Ugh, imagine that.  He's got drool on the pillow and seeds all over.  What kind of dream was he having?  Who knows?  Ugh.  Probably about getting the math question right.  I didn't mean to hurt her.  I'll tend the rabbits more. 
[03:38:00]  The RR1 off button is sticking.  Oh, my grave.  The RR1 off button is sticking.  That's hilarious.  That's why I didn't have music there for you while you were discussing that.  Yeah.  All right, Ant.  Uh, we're going to take a break.  Right.  We didn't get to do the Francine Weekend Review.  We suck with this.  No, we're still working on jingles and stuff.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah, we're trying to actually, you know, produce something.  Yeah.  Instead of just flying off the cuff. 
[03:38:30]  Francine, when did this happen?  I don't know.  I don't know.  We have the jingle, right?  She's a dips and a dope and a moron.  She never learned to add to it too.  She says that she's in college, but she can't tie her shoe.  It's going A to intern, Francine.  Ah!  Holy Jesus.  Where did the...  Steve.  Who wrote that?  There's some anger there. 
[03:39:00]  Oh, my God.  That's crazy.  And where's Rick's thing?  Ah!  That scream is crazy.  So we're working on it.  They're called production pieces.  Ah.  Some elements to make the feature stand out a little bit.  Francine.  Francine.  Francine.  Francine.  Francine.  Francine.  Francine.  Francine.  Ah!  The angry intern.  Play the first one.  Do you want to hear that again?  Hey, Francine, the song is full.  She's behind you. 
[03:39:30]  Oh, hi.  I thought you were down the hall.  That's right.  What's wrong, Francine?  Get on my...  Who wrote that?  Who wrote that?  Angry Steve.  Angry Steve?  That was not funny.  No?  No.  No.  Well, I can tie my shoelaces.  Oh, okay.  Oh, all right.  Prove it.  Pull that part of the song.  I didn't bring my sneakers today.  Don't make Steve write a new version.  Yeah.  She's a dissent, a dope, and a moron. 
[03:40:00]  Oh, my God.  She never learned to add to and to.  She says that she's in college, but she can't tie her shoes.  It's going to do intern, Francine.  Ah!  Ah!  That's me.  All that means is a big thump at the end of it.  That's me.  That's me, Butters.  I don't know.  All right, well.  Hey, fellas.  Francine, when are you in next?  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow?  All right, we'll do the week of review tomorrow, Anthony.  Okay?  Because now we get all the work parts.  Okay.

All right, we've got to get right into  what did we learn today?  We're running out of show, unfortunately, Anthony.  Really fast.  It's Mark from PA.  I learned a few things today. 
[03:50:00]  I learned Jane Mansfield sung happy birthday to JFK.  He also learned four midget hands equal two regular hands.  He learned Sesame Street is sponsored by AZT.  And finally, apartheid was ended with tall fences in South Africa.  Mike from the Bronx.  I learned sensitive ant is swinging by Bellevue  on the way home tonight.  Jerry from Edison.

Also, Jersey Gary writes, I learned it was the Peter Brady and Anthony show today.  Norton was like a Catholic priest at an altar boy sleepover at Hotsfest Friday.  And he also learned that John Lynn better prepare his that stupid year for an American invasion.  That's funny.  Fast Freddy from Long Island.
