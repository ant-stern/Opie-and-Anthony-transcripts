<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, jumping between personal anecdotes, listener interactions, guest appearances, and promotional segments.  The show began with Opie and Anthony discussing their grandmothers, with Opie detailing his aversion to visiting his ailing grandmother in a nursing home.  This segued into humorous speculation about his mother’s confused memories of deceased relatives.  A listener-submitted rap about singer Mira Craig, injured during a stage dive, led to a discussion about bad rap music, including mentions of Biz Markie and a John Wayne rap.  Opie then recounted a series of bizarre incidents involving his valet, Master Poe (who was in the studio), repeatedly activating his OnStar system.

A substantial portion of the broadcast focused on the upcoming Opie and Anthony "Virus Tour" and the listener-run "pest booth."  Doug Out Doug and No Filter Paul, two listeners involved in organizing the booth, were interviewed to resolve a conflict over leadership and budget allocation.  No Filter Paul's appearance was the subject of some joking insults from the hosts.  A caller, Kramer, suggested a stunt for the show: branding the word "hate" onto his chest in exchange for his band's song being played on air; the hosts agreed. The segment concluded with a discussion of "Wow" stickers and a news story about someone briefly clinging to the Popemobile.

The show then shifted to a discussion of post-coital behavior, contrasting men's and women's typical reactions.  Calls from Venetia and Sunshine followed, with both callers offering sexually explicit comments on post-coital activities, sex toys, and body image, including racially charged remarks about body shape.  Michael Chiklis, actor from *The Shield* and *Fantastic Four*, was a guest in the studio.  The hosts also expressed their disdain for certain sports announcers’ styles, using John Sterling and Rick Jeanneret as examples, playing audio clips to illustrate their point.  The segment included a promotion for the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus Comedy Tour and further discussion of aging and sexuality, mentioning a "Whip them out Wednesday" segment on Pal Talk.

Further discussion of sports announcers, specifically John Sterling and Rick Jeanneret, continued, featuring more audio clips of Jeanneret's calls and a caller confirming his long tenure in Buffalo.  Crude comparisons and jokes about their announcing styles were made.  The movie "Knocked Up" was critiqued, with Opie expressing frustration over its comedic structure and the actress's refusal to appear nude in sex scenes. This sparked conversations about movie formulas and unrealistic depictions of sex.  Michael Chiklis, again in studio, discussed his experiences filming *The Thing*, the physical challenges of the costume, early career criticisms, the success and realism of *The Shield*, and his upcoming projects, including the new *Fantastic Four* movie.  A story about a man suing an energy drink company for a three-day erection was also shared.

[00:00:00]  Thank you. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  And he fills his head with salsa. 
[00:04:30]  It's time for people to understand these are words. If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Just words.  Just words.  Hi.  Good morning. Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Make up.  Good morning, Pittsburgh. How are you?  Hi, Pittsburgh. 
[00:05:00]  Haven't said hi to Pittsburgh in a while.  Who else do you want to say hi to this morning?  Oh, how about grandma?  How about Providence?  Grandma's dead, man.  Oh, no. I still got one left.  You do?  Yeah.  Good for you.  She's in a home.  Don't laugh at my grandma.  No, no, no.  It was just a funny little line coming in on instant feedback.  She's in a home.  She has moments of clarity. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, my God.  But, yeah.  Poor Grammy.  Poor Grammy.  Do you want to be a visitor?  No.  I'm a bad grandson.  I should, but I don't know.  I'm from the school of thought that I like remembering people how I remember them.  Full of vim and vigor.  And, I don't know.  It's one of those things.  What, do you want to go to the home?  You know, my mom goes. 
[00:06:00]  She's like in her 90s, you know.  So, my mom goes and just tells me stories about how, yeah, well, she was talking about,  you know, she'll just be saying hi and everything, and then she'll talk about relatives that  have been dead for 40 years.  Oh, God.  Saying like, oh, I saw them last night.  Or, you know, oh, Rosemary, you know, you're supposed to go to school.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Whose mother?  Your mom's or dad?  Yeah, my mom's.  You'd rather drive your Shelby than visit Grammy. 
[00:06:30]  I would like to be a nice guy and do it, but it would be too depressing.  I'm not a, I don't like depressing things.  That's why when people end up in the hospital and stuff, I'm like, oh, I gotta go in there.  And, you know, it's kind of, it's depressing.  Well, no one likes it.  I know.  We go for them.  Yeah.  But, are you really?  Yes.  You just suck it up.  You don't visit old people for you.  I know, right?  I love this place.  Anthony goes there hoping they're going to throw him a party or something. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, the proves are fantastic.  Now, it's one of those things where, you know, it's not just like you're seeing a friend in  the hospital.  Maybe I made a mistake there.  It's not like, hey, how you doing?  And they're like, hey, what's up?  Yeah.  It's not the same person to me.  It's not like, you know, I remember grandma going over there for holidays and she's there  making the sauce and stuff, you know, things like that.  I don't, what am I going to do?  Sit in the chair and be like, hey, how you doing? 
[00:07:30]  What?  Who are you?  Kind of a thing.  She's still making sauce.  Yeah.  Well, in her bed.  No.  See, now.  I'm sorry.  I see.  I don't even know those details.  I hope not.  I just feel like I could make fun because I've made fun of my own grandma.  I know.  Maybe it's inappropriate.  I apologize to Anthony's mama.  She's making sauce and it's being stirred by a giant orderly. 
[00:08:00]  Well, that's what I was getting at, but I was just trying to keep a little Meg, Jimmy.  Thanks.  That's horrid.  Oh, it's hard, but when I was talking about All the Way May, you had no problem jumping  on board.  That's right.  Neither did anyone else, apparently.  Easy.  Had All the Way May.  She's a nun.  Heading toward a hundred.  Leave her alone.  Once they're dead, you can talk about them.  I don't know.  It seems to be the ground rules.  My father's mother.  Carte Blanche on that one.  Yeah, she's a great aunt, anyway, that I never met, so whatever. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  Have fun, boys.  Yeah.  So you don't...  When was the time you saw her?  Sometimes my mommy will pick her up and take her to family little events, Christmas,  things like that, and kind of sit at the table.  It's not much to say.  You go up, you give her a little kiss on the cheek and go, hi, grandma.  Does your mommy do the right thing?  And they change the holidays every hour to make it look like she's at every holiday? 
[00:09:00]  I've never heard of that gag.  What, do you just do it all in one day so that they think that you've taken them out?  You know, you have Thanksgiving in the dining room and you're setting up a birthday party  in the living room.  Oh, so soon?  And you're setting up a, I don't know, a Christmas thing down in the basement and you  just rotate around the house.  You just walk them through the holidays.  Walk them through the holidays and bring them back to the home and they feel much better.  Like they're a part of things still.  No, I've never heard of that gag. 
[00:09:30]  That sounds pretty good though.  Might have to utilize that one.  It just sucks.  Some people can get old and just they're fine.  I don't know.  And then some other people, they kind of lose it.  I don't know what happens.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's not even Alzheimer's.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It's just old?  It's like some kind of old dementia.  Dementia.  Dementia sounds more fun than Alzheimer's.  Yeah.  Dementia is just like, you're like, whoo! 
[00:10:00]  Dementia sounds like-  I'm demented.  No, dementia sounds like, you know, you're just on shrooms the whole time.  Yeah, yeah.  It kind of sounds like that.  Right.  Like, wow, this is cool.  Like, you understand what's going on deep in your brain.  Like, you understand your body doesn't work as well, but you're enjoying the trip.  It's not like Alzheimer's where, I don't remember you.  It's like, I'm kind of freaking out.  I'm seeing, like, hallucinations.  This is great.  Dementia is saving the world in your own mind while you're shuffling into a wall.  Much to the amusement of everybody else. 
[00:10:30]  Don't be outraged.  We're cartoons.  Right.  You're listening to cartoon characters, so don't be outraged.  They're just cartoons.  How was that, CokeLogic?  See how I worked that in?  And I worked that in for CokeLogic because he's working on animation for the virus tour.  Yeah.  And he writes, could you please work in a bit about being cartoons in today's show?  I'm working on an animation for the virus tour.  There you go.  There you go, CokeLogic.  Does this help?  I'm no cartoon. 
[00:11:00]  I'm a real man.  No.  You're not.  You're animated.  If you're a real man, turn sideways.  See, you can't.  See?  You're two-dimensional.  See?  See, you're a cartoon, too.  In every way possible.  One-dimensional.  Former one-dimensional.  All right.  So, I don't even know why we started talking about that, but that's the beauty of this fine radio show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Phone number 877-212-5762. 
[00:11:30]  We got to say hi to all the yuffers out there.  What's up, yuffers?  Who's yuffing?  Or is it yiffing?  Yeah, but now it'll always be yuffing for our show.  Yeah.  So.  It's a plushy term.  Yeah.  Things that.  Well, the guy blew it.  I guess the term really is yiffing.  But he was explaining how, what?  We were talking about that game Second Life, and you go through this virtual world, and there's yuffers that kind of just jump on you while you're trying to, like, you know.  Live your second life online. 
[00:12:00]  Live your second life online, sure.  And you're getting violated by people in, like, stuffed animal outfits.  Yes.  If you see some guy in a stuffed bunny costume coming after you with some type of appendage that he's bought online, get ready to be yuffed.  Yeah.  And that apparently equals being sexually assaulted, your little video game character being sexually assaulted online.  All right.  So, good morning to the yuffers.  The yuffers, or yiffers, or whatever the hell you want to call it.  Yeah. 
[00:12:30]  And, I don't know.  I guess I'm flattered.  I made a bit.  Some dude put this together overnight.  I'll explain in a second, but listen to this.  If you're one of them's gangsters walking around disrespecting me, and you go to them gangsters running your mouth and talking about me.  If you're one of them pranksters flying around making them about me, say if you're one of them's gangsters.  Just wait until the boogeymen come for you.  Here's my ditto, me, myself, and my voodoo crew. 
[00:13:00]  You just don't know.  We'll get your mommy, we'll get your daddy, and we'll get you, you, you, you, your grandma, too, and your dog.  We'll get your mommy, we'll get your daddy, and we'll get you, you, your grandma, too.  And your dog.  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.  Ah!  Yeah, there you go.  Oh, I fell off the stage.  That's Mira Craig.  I was reading her lyrics yesterday on the show.  She's our stage diving chick that we love because she stage dove into the wood floor, basically. 
[00:13:30]  No one caught her.  And she shattered, what, both her knees, we learned yesterday?  Her knees.  So we got the lyrics to the song she was singing just before she stage dived, and then someone put it to music, obviously.  Bluto.  Bluto came up with that.  That's Bluto?  Yeah, came up with that.  Bluto, bluto, bluto.  Came up with that overnight.  So there, there you go.  Good.  You can rap.  You got some chops.  Imagine if it becomes just like a massive hit and I have to leave the show.  Yeah, let's imagine that. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, I could dream.  Slow down.  I could dream.  I'm going to leave this crap behind.  Imagine as a goof, I do rap lyrics and someone's like, wow, he's the new Eminem.  My God.  Yeah, because you don't know.  You're right, because you don't know what's good or not.  I don't think we're educated enough to really know what good hip hop or bad hip hop is.  No, once his name was huge with, you know, girl, you got what I need.  Yeah.  Girl, you.  You.  You got what I need. 
[00:14:30]  Biz Markie, thank you.  Yeah, Biz Markie.  He stinks, but he became huge.  Yep.  So maybe I'm the next Biz Markie.  I stink, but I become huge.  Could be.  And then everyone just walks around going, I just don't get it.  But it's on every radio station.  Just playing it like crazy.  What the hell is this?  This is bigger than Rick D's Disco Duck.  Oh, God.  Remember the rap in Duke?  Oof.  Huh?  Remember the rap in Duke with some awful John Wayne rap? 
[00:15:00]  Remember that?  And John Wayne was actually rapping in it?  Well.  Oh, no.  John Wayne was dead.  I think John Wayne was long dead.  Oh, okay.  40 pounds of treats in his colon laying in a casket somewhere.  Yeah, that's the rumor.  Yeah, 40 pounds of food.  Yeah.  The old Duke.  All he probably wanted was a malt liquor and a steak.  Yeah, a few cigarettes.  40 pounds of grizzle.  Yeah, 40 pounds of grizzle.  Grizzle.  Big bones.  T-bones.  Yeah.  All right.  I also had a great time driving home yesterday. 
[00:15:30]  What happened?  Hopefully, you got pulled over again.  No, no, no.  Not pulled over.  Apparently, I didn't really take much interest in a story that was being told to me walking  into the building yesterday from Master Poe.  Master Poe.  Apparently, when he adjusts my rearview mirror, which I have to have done probably 10,000 times  in my vehicle.  And somehow, he's constantly hitting my OnStar buttons.  He's constantly hitting them. 
[00:16:00]  I think just to converse with somebody.  Well, did you explain-  Hello, OnStar.  Hello.  Did you explain that you drive into the city?  Mm-hmm.  And you get out, and then Master Poe just helps you out and takes your car a mere block.  Yeah, a block and a half.  And half the time, you get the car back, and there's always some weird problem with it.  Like, all of a sudden, there's a lot of Spanish stations on your radio.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Spanish stations.  All programmed in.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's Spanish stations on there.  The mirrors are all adjusted.  The seat height has changed.  Just to drive a little over a block. 
[00:16:30]  Once, my navigation system was set for Ohio.  I'm not kidding.  And I'm not making any accusations here.  I'm just saying, once, I got into my car, and it was set for Ohio.  Yeah.  So, I don't know what that was all about.  So, he said yesterday, while we were walking in, he goes,  Oh, I accidentally hit your OnStar again.  I was like, oh my-  And then I'm thinking, oh my God, what button?  Because there's, you know, there's the red cross button on there, which instantly gets 
[00:17:00]  the emergency service.  And then there's a white button, which you hit, and it's a built-in phone.  And it's voice activated.  So, it's completely hands-free.  It says, number please, and I'll say something like, Jimmy Norton.  And then it'll say, calling, Jimmy Norton.  And then Jimmy Norton gets called from my car.  Well, I go to call my girl, so I hit the button, and it goes, number please, and I 
[00:17:30]  say, baby, because that's what I have around there.  Oh, that's adorable.  My baby.  So, I go, baby.  And it goes, calling, Opie.  So, I quickly hit the button.  Because that's just creepy.  Yeah, I hit the button.  On so many levels.  So, I go, well, I must have said it wrong, because sometimes the voice recognition doesn't  pick up right.  So, I hit it again, and it says, number, and I say, baby, calling, Opie. 
[00:18:00]  It's like, this is really creepy.  And, of course, the third time it happens again.  Baby, calling, Opie.  And I just, like, hung up, realized what must have happened.  And, somehow, baby got erased from the memory on my car, so I had to reinstall baby.  Yeah, but you got a new baby.  New baby.  It's Opie.  It was so, like, I was getting mad at my vehicle for mocking me.  It's like, calling, baby, calling Opie.  You homo. 
[00:18:30]  Like, no, I'm not calling Opie.  Opie is not my baby.  Where's my baby?  No, I don't have on queer.  It's OnStar.  It wasn't calling.  Baby wasn't in the vehicle.  It had been extracted.  And all I could think, because Master Poe was then telling me.  So, I hit the button, and I'm saying, like, no.  It goes, you know, because would you like to place a call, number.  And he's going, no. 
[00:19:00]  Stop.  Eject.  But he's just saying things into the OnStar thing, and it's not understanding him.  So, I'm just thinking at some point, he said, must have said delete or something like it, and it just deleted baby from the memory.  And it's just constantly something.  I get in there.  My seat's all the way back.  I got to pull it up 20 feet.  He drives a lousy block, block and a half with your car every day. 
[00:19:30]  Oh.  Oh, man.  That's funny.  It is something.  Hey, by the way, Bird in Philly, listening on WYSP.  He writes on Instant Feedback.  John Wayne was the rapping duke.  Meanwhile, Opie is the rapping douche.  Oh.  We got the rapping duke?  All right, let's take a listen to this.  It's awful.  Go.  Oh.  Oh, well.  Wow.  We actually have it?  It was actually a very popular song.  What year?  I don't know.  80s, I think.  Sounds old school. 
[00:20:00]  I was just...  Oh, this is going to be bad, right?  So you think you're bad with your rap?  Well, I'll tell you, Pilgrim, I started the crap.  When you were in diapers and wetting the sheets, I was at the Ponderosa rapping to the beat.  Da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha.  I remember this.  I'm sure I rustled some cattle and I did the sheets, but my main name was rapping to the beat.  I don't bother nobody, I'm a real nice guy.  Kind of laid back like a dead fly. 
[00:20:30]  Da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da 
[00:21:00]  Oh, my God.  It's James.  Not Al Pasa, I see.  Oh, my God.  200.  I've made an ass of myself.  Oh, my God.  Turn it off.  I'm sorry I did that.  I'm embarrassed that I did that.  Turn it off.  Oh.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Hey, Master Poe, what's going on?  Good morning, Opie.  Ah, Master Poe. 
[00:21:30]  You know, when we were walking in yesterday,  you were explaining the OnStar thing,  and I, like, we kind of reached the office  before you really gave me the details of what happened,  and I started thinking,  he said that he hit the OnStar  and that, like, something happened  and you were trying to get it to stop,  but then we kind of didn't finish the story.  How did that end?  What happened with the OnStar?  Well, I was just trying to stop him from talking.  I kept on talking.  It asked me what phone number I wanted to dial,  and I said, I don't want to dial the number. 
[00:22:00]  You said that.  I'm not saying no.  He's talking to my car.  He's trying to stop him from talking.  What are you, in the mafia?  Master Poe is skilled in martial arts,  but, you know, he's scared of Anthony's car.  He doesn't know how to take on a car yet.  I would have put your car in a chokehold.  That would have shut it up.  Basically, Anthony wants you to stop  fiddling with his buttons.  Master Poe liked to fiddle.  Just stop fiddling. 
[00:22:30]  He's fiddling.  He presses the ones that he thinks are pretty,  like the red cross.  Have you ever hit the emergency button on the OnStar?  The emergency button?  Yeah, where the live person comes on  and chats with you.  No, I've never done that.  Why?  You want me to?  No, no, I was just wondering  because I remember a time back  you hit a button  and I believe it was the live person  that actually came on.  Why are you just hitting all these buttons  to drive a block? 
[00:23:00]  You know, I'm not too sure.  I tend to hit things.  Just stop fiddling.  He's fiddling.  Fiddling.  People are saying  I should have an ejection seat button.  I put like a big thing on it  that just says push here  with a smiley face.  All right.  So how did that end?  Because somehow my girlfriend's number  got taken out of my vehicle's memory. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, I'm sorry.  I don't know.  It was talking and I said no.  I kept on saying no  and finally it decided to stop talking.  He's fighting your car every morning.  It's a battle.  It's a battle.  It's the Escalade against Poe  in a no holds barred match.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  No.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[00:24:00]  Is that Poe in my car?  Yeah, just losing it.  Hey, all right, Poe.  We got to take a break.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Anthony was very polite  how he talked about this on the air.  You should hear him behind the scenes, though, man.  It's ugly.  Behind the scenes?  Behind the scenes.  It's ugly what he's saying.  Poe's a born killer.  He just protects me on the street.  He just wants you to stop fiddling.  Fiddling.  All right, Poe.  I'll make sure I don't touch anything anymore.  All right.  There he goes.  Master Poe.  He's a professional killer. 
[00:24:30]  Tom from Westbury.  Can you guys get Roland to do the Mirror Craig lyrics?  Oh.  Is Roland in today?  Oh, great.  He'll do the Mirror Craig lyrics.  We're trying to find a rap star among us.  Obviously, I'm not going to be the one.  But maybe it's Roland.  You never know.  Maybe Roland becomes the next Biz Marky.  I could be.  All right.  Take a quick break.  We'll continue.  You have to lose a few pounds first.  Biz Marky was a big boy.  Yeah, well.  A big boy.  I think that's the point. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  Why don't we play that to break?  A little Drew Boogie as we go to break.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We'll be right back. 
[00:25:30]  Hey, good morning.  How's everybody today?  My eggs are runny.  Ew.  Your eggs are runny?  Yeah.  Runny. 
[00:26:00]  Nice.  You want me to just pick them up and throw them on your back?  Something you're used to?  No.  No.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hi.  Hi.  No filter, Paul, and dug out Doug today.  What's going on?  Two uber fans of the Opie and Anthony show.  We got the ONA Traveling Virus Comedy Tour 10 days out from today.  Yes.  June 16th, of course.  Jones Beach, a Saturday.  We can't wait.  Yeah.  Playing Long Island.  Doing something on Long Island for the first time in a long time. 
[00:26:30]  Yep.  Back home, as they say.  And there's some kind of power struggle going on.  Yeah.  There's these constant little power struggles going on within the Opie and Anthony community.  The community of message board people.  The community of people that are involved with things like the assaults on the media that we used to have on this show.  And other things that we're up to.  And there's these little power plays going on.  And some people feel they're being left out or passed over when we go to somebody else for a bid idea or to set something up. 
[00:27:00]  So there's constantly this battle going on.  Well, part of the ONA Traveling Virus Comedy Tour, you got the eight or nine comedians on the stage.  You got Ant and I doing our thing and showing videos and bringing people up.  We also have the ONA Village.  We're really trying to give you as much as humanly possible for your buck.  Yep.  For your buckaroonie. 
[00:27:30]  It's a whole day of hanging out and having a good time.  Yeah.  With your friends and then with the comedians.  There's...  It starts with the tailgating.  The parking lot tailgating, that is hysterical.  Actually, when we did the show in Jersey and we're going to Jersey again this year, they started their festivities at a rest area.  Yep.  And then they did the tailgating.  And then they did the ONA Village.  And then they finally went into the venue to check out the comedians from the show.  And then after that was a huge signing.  Signing for like, what, two hours, I think?  At least two hours? 
[00:28:00]  So this goes on for hours.  And it's just a lot of things to do, a lot of things to see.  And it's a blast.  One of my favorite parts is taking that stupid golf cart and driving through the parking lot during the tailgating.  Yeah.  And hanging out and having a couple of beers with the people that are hanging there, cooking.  You know, chicks are flashing.  It's just a great party atmosphere.  My favorite part of last year was when Jimmy was mooning the parking lot from the golf cart.  I wanted him to fall off the golf cart and scar up that perfect boyish butt of his. 
[00:28:30]  That video is still out there somewhere.  You know, good luck finding it.  Just go to perfect.com.  It's on YouTube.  Is it?  Yeah.  All right.  Sorry.  I think it's on break, too.  I like break.  Well, just throw Jim Norton in the search and you'll probably find him mooning everybody from a golf cart.  It's fun, though, man, because all the fans are just animals.  They're drinking.  It was actually a really cool hangman.  I never mind being around the listeners.  They're just...  As long as I don't touch you. 
[00:29:00]  Just don't touch me.  I don't mind shaking hands or back clapping.  Just no facial.  We really have the greatest audience because they know how to party and rock and never a problem.  No, having a good time.  Oh, not good.  I know, I know.  But never a problem for the most part.  And what do we got?  We got the four mezzanine tickets for $69.  That's a special they're running for the Jones Beach Show.  June 16th will be there.  Brought to you by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  You can get your tickets through Ticketmaster.com.  You can go to our MySpace page for the Virus Tour. 
[00:29:30]  It's called just Virus Tour, one word.  And you get all the info.  And if they're doing the right thing, if Pete is smart enough, he would have the Jim Norton mooning video up there.  And the other videos we did on tour last year.  Because we filmed some stuff as we're at the venue and stuff.  Like the shower scene with us three was very, very cool.  That should be up on Virus Tour on MySpace.  Virus Tour, one word.  Maybe they won't show anything with nudity at all on MySpace.  I mean, that might be a my – like even an ass might get you dumped. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, I'm only guessing.  But they seem pretty –  That's too bad because those videos will help sell the show.  It just shows some of the fun we're having with this damn thing.  So we're going to have Doug Out Doug and No Filter Paul try to talk it out.  Because as part of the ONA Village, because we love our listeners so much.  We gave the listeners or actually the past, which are hardcore listeners, a booth in the ONA Village.  And they're allowed to do whatever the hell they want with it.  We don't tell them. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  They could come up with the craziest idea.  We're not going to stop them.  Do what you want.  You're on display.  Right, right.  And apparently there's some kind of a power play going on as to who is in charge of this booth and who's organizing it.  And I think Doug is upset because he thinks No Filter Paul's in charge.  Well, we're going to have to get Kenny involved because I think Kenny –  He was on delegating responsibility.  I think Kenny bypassed Doug Out Doug and went to No Filter Paul.  And I think that's where this whole thing started. 
[00:31:00]  Right, Kenny?  Kenny!  Oh, boy.  Is that how it started?  Hello.  Oh, good morning.  Hi, morning, Kenny.  Good morning, Kenny.  And what – you know, I don't mean to –  All said.  Correct you, but what you said about, like, they have free reign with the booth isn't exactly true  because these people need to be kept tight reins on.  Oh, okay.  So, Kenny is kind of – you're the big boss.  You're overseeing what goes on. 
[00:31:30]  Well, yeah, I'm coordinating with the pest for the pest booth and the petting zoo.  And the person you're coordinating through seems to be No Filter Paul.  Well, last year, General Bam seemed to take the lead in things.  General Bam, yes.  And now I don't know.  I haven't heard of him.  I don't know if he's still –  Where's he been?  Yeah, like he –  I have no idea.  Maybe he lost stature in the O&A community because that's what it all is with these people.  Yeah, it's a mob mentality.  You get some new – 
[00:32:00]  Here's what I've noticed.  You get some new guys taking out hits on the other guy.  Yeah, yeah, it is a mob mentality because here's what I've noticed all through the years.  And for people that don't think this is true, it is because I've seen it happen throughout years and years of this.  When people get a little too popular, like you'll get a few personalities that'll rise above the rest as far as message board people go or people that do little bits for the show, people that are on the air a lot, they get – people will resent them. 
[00:32:30]  And then they'll try their best to chop them down.  Right.  And eliminate them to better give them a chance to rise to the top.  Well, General Bam lost a little – I need that!  General Bam lost a little power because he started the F-Free FM chant during the Halloween broadcast.  All right, and then open off on him.  Well, he thought it would be a great idea to start a F-Free FM chant as we're trying to broadcast live, which made it impossible for us to broadcast live because you have what? 
[00:33:00]  How many people were there? Close to 1,000 people, 800 people, something like that, 800 people all screaming the F-word as we're live on regular radio.  Yeah.  And I'm like, how is that helping us?  Yeah, that really wasn't helpful.  Like in the end, you're hurting us.  Well, aren't you supposed to be supporting us?  Yeah.  But he thought that was supporting us, but I would argue it wasn't supporting us because we couldn't do what we're here to do, which is broadcast to people.  Right. 
[00:33:30]  But I got over it, but I don't know.  He apologized, I think.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that was over.  I'm past that, but that, I think, knocked his status down just a little bit.  Was he demoted?  Within the pest community.  From general?  Did he go down to something?  I don't know, but I think there's going to be a new chant.  Bird colonel?  I think there's going to be a new chant at Jones Beach, by the way, but we'll have to wait and see on that.  So now it's Dugout Doug and No Filter Paul, and you went to No Filter Paul for ideas for the pest booth? 
[00:34:00]  Well, the thing is, you know, two heads are always better than one.  Right.  So, you know, we want to get as many people involved as possible in this situation.  Oh, Jesus.  Doug had volunteered his input, all right?  And, you know, coincidentally, I happen to talk to Paul on a regular basis because he's involved with Jimmy's merchandise.  So I...  The cocaine or the heroin?  Which merchandise?  Oh, Ant, don't even go there.  Sorry.  Yeah. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  The commodities, we'll refer to him.  Commodities.  You know, so I talk to Paul frequently, and I wanted to get him involved.  And then what happened?  And I guess...  And then what happened?  You know, I don't want to speak for anybody else when they're not here to defend themselves  or put their two cents in, but my take on it is that somebody got insulted because they  weren't the big shot anymore.  There was a lack of respect.  Right.  Well, we got no filter Paul in the studio. 
[00:35:00]  And, Paul, a little advice to you.  You shouldn't wear layers.  It makes your head even smaller.  Right?  This guy, you should walk around with just topless.  Because your head is...  Your head is unusually small to begin with, and then you wear layers because it's a little  chilly in New York today, and it makes your...  You've got like a shrunken head look to you.  Shrunken head?  He looks like Mancow.  If you took Mancow's stupid head and threw it in like an oven or a microwave for a couple  minutes... 
[00:35:30]  I made a shrinky dink out of it.  I made a shrinky dink out of Mancow's skull.  It looks like he insulted the daughter of a witch doctor.  You've got a teeny little head, man.  His head poking out.  You know what it looks like with the hood around it?  It looks like you put on...  What was the robot from Lost in Space?  If a person put that outfit on and then took the helmet off...  Took the helmet off.  Yeah, you look like a Disney character without the head on.  There you go.  Very good.  Morning, Paul.  Yeah, and nice to see you guys again. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, how you doing?  Yeah, whatever.  It's not make-believe we like each other.  You're here for a bit.  I like Paul.  Hello to all my friends and Opie.  I like you, Paul.  Who, E-Rock and who else?  Okay.  I like Paul.  He's just really obnoxious, though.  Okay.  You can look at me.  It bombed.  No, I wouldn't even say it bombed and we're all determining how true it is.  I wouldn't even say that was a bomb. 
[00:36:30]  Two Club Soda Kenny from Dugout Dug.  Is this worth reading there, E-Rock?  I'm going through it right now.  Okay.  We got Dugout Dug on the line here.  Dugout Dug, what's going on, buddy?  Good morning, guys.  How you doing?  By the way, thanks for all you do.  Thank you very much.  I'm going to acknowledge that right off the bat.  Thank you for all you've done.  I'm taking it on the jaded one?  As we left the show yesterday, you would have been the jaded one, yes.  Okay.  I don't know if I can play that role.  You're the scorned bitch. 
[00:37:00]  So what happened?  What's going on here?  I don't really know, but I can tell you that I wasn't upset about anything.  Back in March, when the virus stuff was first announced, I think that email that E-Rock  just passed you was the email that I was trying to get in touch with Kenny.  Because I believe, I think Kenny had called me and said, hey, I remember you were doing  the pest booth last year.  Will you be doing it again?  I told him in the phone call, I said, yeah, I'd be more than happy to help out. 
[00:37:30]  And he said, okay, well, come up with some ideas, get the ball rolling, get with me at  the end of the week.  I think that's the last time I talked to him.  Hmm.  Well, did you get back to him?  I had called him and left him voicemails five times.  And if you take a look in that email that E-Rock gave you, I actually had emailed Jimmy  and asked Jimmy what the story was.  And he said, well, I don't know, Kenny's handling it. 
[00:38:00]  I got an email back in May saying, I'll be in touch.  And that's the last I heard of anything.  Did I email you back?  I didn't remember that.  I'm sure I did.  I'm not really going to say what it was.  You had told E-Rock for me to send you my information.  I assumed it was the pest booth, but it was something else.  Okay.  All right.  So are you met at No Filter Paul?  You met at Kenny?  You don't give a crap.  Where are we at?  What happened was probably about, I don't know, a week or two weeks ago, Paul had sent me a 
[00:38:30]  private message saying, well, people on the boards, just take a step back.  People on the boards are going, what's up with the pest booth?  What's up with the pest booth?  And I'm going, I don't know.  I tried a couple months ago.  The first couple things I asked were, what were the venues that were going to have a pest  booth?  Because I remember you guys said not all the venues were going to have them.  So I wasn't going to...  Yeah, like Mohegan Sun, I don't think it's going to have the O&A Village because it's  indoors at a casino. 
[00:39:00]  But most of the places, yeah, we're going to have the O&A Village, which means a pest  booth.  I wasn't going to ask people to volunteer if we weren't sure if their venue was going to  do it.  The second thing was last year, your other radio company had given us some money.  And that's what we got our prizes with and our gear with.  Oh, you need a budget.  The second thing I needed to know was the budget, which is in that email there.  I had nothing to go on.  And then two weeks ago, which is really cutting it close, is the first I heard from Paul. 
[00:39:30]  Paul, comment?  Yeah, basically, Kenny had chased up saying that, you know, he hadn't heard back from  Doug and all that.  So he said, you know, he's really busy with your HBO thing.  So can you get a hold of Doug and see where he's at?  And that's what I did.  And I guess Doug got a little upset thinking I'd taken over the pest booth, which I absolutely  haven't.  Boof.  Boof.  We have an F.  So are you guys working together?  Right now, they want money.  We have a ton of ideas that a lot of people post on the board, which I made a list of. 
[00:40:00]  What are some of the ideas for the pest booth?  Oh, wait a minute.  When you called Doug, he thought you were calling as an authority figure, kind of like saying,  all right, what's going on here, Doug?  Yeah, pretty much when the sentence started with, Kenny asked me to call you and.  Okay.  So I don't know how that panned out.  I think one of the big problems was with that is, if you look at that email, too, I had  just changed cell phones.  So apparently Paul said that he was calling me, but he was calling my old number. 
[00:40:30]  So I wasn't even getting his voicemails until I saw his post probably about, you know, like  I said, two weeks ago, and I never actually talked to Paul.  I just kind of said, you know, what happened here?  Did you sneak yourself in there and take this over?  I mean, I wasn't really jaded or anything.  It was just someone tell me.  So I stopped doing whatever I'm doing.  All right.  What do you got, Paul?  Well, I thought it might have something to do with some of the posts you made on an online  message board about you being done with the pest.  Could that be why you didn't reply in the course?  No, Paul, I just said that if you take a look at that first email I sent to Kenny, the 
[00:41:00]  first line says, Kenny, I have a new phone number.  So if you call me, call this number.  That would not be the phone number that you have.  I have both your numbers.  I called both.  I could sit here for two hours and tell you I never got your call.  All right.  So what's the point to all this?  The point is we've only got like, what, 10 days to get this together?  Yeah.  Who's forking out the money for the prizes?  And then the rest of it I'll get people to do. 
[00:41:30]  If Doug's busy, whatever, that's fine.  So you guys don't have a budget at this point?  No, we have a list of stupid ideas.  All right.  Let's hear your ideas.  Maybe.  Don't put the word my in these.  All right.  Well, actually, one of my favorites, which I'd like to take credit for, but I think it  was either Redding or Coke Lodge's idea, was to have a game where you have to throw food  into E-Rock's mouth.  Throw?  Yeah, throw.  What's that?  Now, the real E-Rock or?  Well, I thought that's what they meant, which I thought, I don't think Eric would do that,  but no, they meant like cardboard cutouts and you have to throw stuff in. 
[00:42:00]  So you've got to throw food into E-Rock's mouth.  What do you win?  Well, you know, if the budget's a dollar, not a lot.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  The Pest Booth's going to suck.  Exactly.  No one knows what they're doing.  What's happening?  Yeah, that's what we're saying.  Yeah, you guys got to get together.  What are some of the other ideas?  Some kind of Pest Gong show where people would just go up there and think they're funny  and we just gong them off pretty quickly.  The deaf karaoke you guys did in studio would be kind of funny.  Yep.  I wanted to do the dunking booth.  I thought people would love to dunk me, but let's talk about insurance and this clown 
[00:42:30]  guy's coming back again.  Yeah, we got the obnoxious clown in the dunking booth this year at the O&A Village.  Some kind of boob pong where you throw a ball into a cleavage, but it'll be a fat dude's  cleavage and not, you know, something attractive.  Yeah, that's some good stuff.  Hey, that's why I didn't say mine.  So anyway, Doug, you know, I'm going to put my list down right now and why don't we talk  about what you would do?  Let me tell you something.  And this is the only reason why when I saw Paul was doing this thing, I don't think I 
[00:43:00]  caused a huff.  I mean, you say I caused a huff.  I don't think that happened.  I just kind of said, okay, all yours.  Because basically, I know Paul is the kind of guy that needs love from anybody he can get  it from, and last year, you guys spent about two shows a couple of times, you know, during  the show, mocking these stupid ideas that were put out for the test booth.  Paul, those are the dumbest ideas.  You don't think that E-Rock's got to do something before these shows? 
[00:43:30]  He's going to come and have someone throw a freaking mail packet at his mouth?  We already said that would be a cardboard cutout face.  Are you paying attention or are you still asleep in Virginia?  I concentrated on, yes, the time's different here.  Exactly.  I concentrated on three things last year with the test booth.  One, we wanted to make it fun.  Two, we wanted to give as much to the fans as possible.  And three, we wanted to see bodacious ta-tas.  Hence, we had the Andrea Yates Challenge where the women were dunking balls in water, getting 
[00:44:00]  their breasts wet, and flashing them all over the place.  What's better than that?  Yeah, boobs always win.  Yeah, probably that is just a half the ideas.  All right, listen.  So, Doug, do you have ideas for the test booth?  I really, I haven't put a lot of time into it because the last time I heard anything was  March.  All right, how about this?  We give you like a few days to come up with some ideas for the test booth.  And then how about we decide as a show what the pests are going to do? 
[00:44:30]  We actually had a couple of things going.  I've got to go back and read it.  But we had a couple of decent ideas going.  We were trying to, once again, get some women topless, which everybody always likes.  Yeah, I think the key is to have wet t-shirts or boobage.  Yeah, exactly.  Someone had an idea with somehow trying to get girls to hang their panties on a tree.  And at the final show, we can give you guys a big tree full of panties and stuff like  that.  You guys can put in the studio. 
[00:45:00]  But see, that's what we're going to do.  What the hell are we going to do with that?  Make soup?  Big panties.  Oh, yeah.  Stir them up in a big pot of boiling water.  Can you imagine?  80% of them would be like 50 feet across.  Hey, hey.  Not all our women are messes.  Yeah, you have some good women.  Yeah, absolutely.  All right.  Well...  It's good eggs if you saw the pictures last year.  There was a lot.  All right.  I was going at the PNC show.  There was a lot of flacky.  So, Doug, obviously, the pest booth, it's still open.  It's anyone's call here.  I mean, why don't you come up with some ideas?  We'll check back with you on Friday, and we'll see where we're at. 
[00:45:30]  Okay.  The big thing is just figuring out what we have.  Right.  I mean, this stuff doesn't pay for itself, obviously.  And why do you guys hate each other?  No filter, Paul, and Doug out there.  I've got no problem with Doug.  Oh, no?  No.  No, I don't hate Paul either.  Paul's a pain in the butt, but...  Language, Doug.  He really gets under your skin.  I've read some stuff where each of them have bashed each other on various boards and stuff,  though.  Yeah.  Yeah, on time.  It's been a good one.  Somebody actually... 
[00:46:00]  I just saw a post that said, no filter, Paul is a nice fellow.  And your response was, what are you, insane?  Yeah, Doug, thanks for that.  Good.  Nice one, Paul.  You left the K off.  That's good.  That's really smart right there.  That's good.  All right, Doug, we're going to let you go.  All right, Doug.  All right.  Talk to you later.  Well, we didn't accomplish anything with this 15 minutes.  Well, no, I think we did because we found out that the pest booth is right now, it's Bosnia. 
[00:46:30]  It's just, I thought they were all like, I'm like, why aren't we hearing ideas and stuff  like that's because they're in disarray behind them?  Right, right.  Well, now we know that we have to get that.  We wouldn't have known this until two days before.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Kramer in Pittsburgh.  It's all about Pittsburgh this morning.  What's up, Kramer?  All right, guys.  Here's the deal.  I want to do a stunt for the show.  Yeah, what do you want to do?  I want to get my chest branded.  I want the word hate branded on my chest.  The word hate branded on your chest.  All right.  How are we getting this done? 
[00:47:00]  I want to, within like the next month, I want to come up to New York, get that done, but  I want to get my new song played on the radio.  No problem.  No problem.  If you want to.  Done.  Book it.  If you want to brand the word hate into your chest and we'll play a song for you.  Where?  On one of your pecs, obviously.  Sounds reasonable.  I didn't hear what you said, Oaks.  On your peck?  Yeah, right on my pecs, man.  And do you have the hate thing all made and everything?  Oh, I can make it up.  I've done like brandings on the back of guys' necks, but I never got one done myself. 
[00:47:30]  I have never seen that live.  I would love to check that out.  It's got to stink.  Wait, what do you do with the branding?  What do you do?  You just heat it up and just pop.  How long does it hurt for?  Probably a couple weeks.  And then the worst part is like the itching that you get from what I hear.  Yeah, the black fraternities and the sororities, they're big into the branding.  They do, right?  Also, some of the football programs, they do it as well.  It's hardcore, man. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, they brand like the, a lot of those black fraternities will brand the arm.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I only have seen it in black fraternities.  I don't see many white guys branding, uh, branding themselves.  I think white people with tattoos show up better.  Hey, Kramer.  Yeah.  We're all in.  Hold on the line.  We'll figure this out.  What's, what's the name of your band?  Crimes Against Humanity.  Nice.  That's like a fun group.  What do you guys do?  Like, light pop?  Yeah, we're on line to Britney Spears.  Are you, are you an emo band? 
[00:48:30]  What's the name of the song, dude?  Um, basically the song, we're even just trying to get a name for the song, but it's just  about, you know, Satan wanting to get back into heaven.  Satan wanting to get back into heaven?  I think we're calling it Ascent, the song.  Okay.  He doesn't want to go out and get up there to, you know, have fun, though.  He wants to kind of trash the place, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, okay.  I didn't assume he wanted to get up there and everything was hunky-dory.  You ought to call the song, uh, Hey, I didn't mean it. 
[00:49:00]  All right, cool.  Kramer, hold on a line.  We'll have you brand hate on your chest live on the air and we'll get your band played.  No problem.  Awesome, man.  Awesome.  That is easy.  All right, hold on.  Get, uh, get Kramer's info.  We got to take a break.  No filter, Paul.  Thanks.  Just go hang out somewhere else.  If we need you, we'll, uh, call you back into the studio.  No problem.  We'll roll you back in.  And then we'll, uh, we got to figure out the pest booth for the ONA Traveling Virus, obviously.  There's still not an idea from you, uh, you guys.  Go to VirusTour, one word for all the info on the ONA Traveling Virus Comedy Tour. 
[00:49:30]  Eight or nine comedians you know and love from the show.  Matter of fact, we'll give away a pair of tickets right now to a random caller.  Give us a call, 877-212-5762.  These are tickets for the Jones Beach Show, which is 10 days out, June 16th, a week from  Saturday.  Brought to you by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  Uh, call now and we'll give you tickets.  Just make sure you can use them, okay?  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  We tell you how to get a wow sticker, but we can't flood the website. 
[00:50:00]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show on this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Let's not forget about Wow.  It's alive and well, especially on Pal Talk.  We're watching the listeners, uh, listen to the radio show, and we got a bunch of ladies  wowing us today, so thank you very much for that.  Wow is very simple.  You get a wow sticker, you throw it on the back of your car, you make a homemade wow  sign, you write it in the dirt.  Wow represents Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  There are women out there, they will see the wows, and they will flash you as you drive 
[00:50:30]  to your boring job.  Yep.  Nice little, uh, waker-upper for your commute.  Breaking news, of course.  Yeah, we got, uh, the Popemobile was attacked.  Nothing happened to the Pope.  CNN just showed the, uh, the video about 20 times in a row, over and over and over again.  Some dope jumps out of the, uh, the crowd right in front of a security guy, by the way.  Yeah.  But he got past that guy, and he was able to hang on to the Popemobile as he's like, uh,  slowly riding by, waving. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, the Pope's waving, and the guy's being kind of dragged by the Popemobile, because  he's holding on to the back, and he's got like five security guys trying to pull him off.  Finally gets him off of the back of it, and they just kind of pile on top of him.  And the Pope didn't even flinch.  No, the Pope just kept waving.  So much for having that connection with God.  He didn't, he didn't even know what was going on behind him, two feet.  Maybe he did, and he's so connected, he knew it was nothing.  That's true.  Good point, Jimmy.  Yeah, just keep waving.  Don't worry.  That guy lunged about probably, he missed him by what, maybe a foot and a half? 
[00:51:30]  Uh, two feet.  He was right there.  He was hanging on to the back.  It didn't look like he had a weapon or anything.  He didn't have a bomb strapped to him.  It looked like he was just trying to, what, he was going to try to strangle the Pope?  If he had a bomb strapped to him, that whole, they all would have been dead.  But he might not have gotten that close because of, uh, like someone said he was indoors.  Well, actually, now we're, we're, we're finding out he was in St. Peter's Square.  Oh, see?  They got some security in that area.  You're not just walking in that area with a bomb strapped to you.  Never know.  Vatican City, so.  Uh, that's your video of the day. 
[00:52:00]  They're showing it over and over and over again on CNN especially.  Yeah, he didn't have any, uh, there was no bubble.  Like after he got shot, they had a bubble.  And this guy had no bubble.  He looked like a dude from Milwaukee that, uh, could easily be at a Brewers game.  He had that look.  Right?  He had that look.  It didn't look too threatening.  He looked a little, uh.  Crazy look on his face.  Just a fan of the Pope.  He looked like he might have had a few pops and said, hey, well, you know.  But basically what we were talking about last week where you get that urge.  Yeah.  To, like, run on the field at a sporting event. 
[00:52:30]  I'm going to do it, man.  Right, right.  Or you're, or you go to a live taping of something and, and your mind starts going, man,  I would, I think I could just run on that stage and do something stupid.  I could do it.  I could do it.  And then normal people just, uh, don't do it.  Right, right.  You think about it and the consequences and you don't do it.  But then you get those people maybe a little drunk or a little crazy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They do it.  They do it.  Well, he did.  That guy was all caught up in the moment of the Pope, perhaps.  The security wasn't that great.  It took a little while to really control the guy.  Yeah.  And he had to jump over one of the security guys. 
[00:53:00]  Over the barrier, right in front of one of the security guys.  Yeah.  I'm passing.  That would have been a touchdown.  He yelled, own a party rock.  All right.  We got Club Soda Kenny still in the studio.  We started this bid yesterday.  But basically, we got the staff to, uh, to go through the, uh, the female playbook.  And that would be like Cosmo and all those, uh, women's magazines that are on the newsstands.  Yeah.  The ladies' magazines.  And they got, uh, you know, some interesting covers where it's like sex tips from guys.  You know, women are reading this stuff. 
[00:53:30]  All the, how to make your orgasm last twice as long.  Yeah.  You've seen the magazines a million times.  So we got the staff behind the scenes to go through all the, all the female mags, magazines  and pick out some of their favorite articles that they came across.  Are women really learning stuff from this?  Do they really read this and trade the ideas with, with each other?  You know what I read in Cosmo?  It was a guy's point of view on what they liked during sex.  And I think it's very handy.  Let me give you some tips. 
[00:54:00]  Or do they just thumb through it like we would and just go, oh, what a bunch of crap.  I don't know.  Maybe the women could call and tell us.  I have no idea.  Because the one we did the other day, like how to keep your man, like, awake after sex  was completely ridiculous.  Yeah, it's how to keep that spark and passion going after the sex is over with.  So you're all done.  And you're supposed to keep, like, this passion going.  Meanwhile, you're both exhausted.  You're sweating.  Yeah, if you have a really good...  You're picking hairs off your girlfriend's chest that came out of your head and chest. 
[00:54:30]  You're collecting all the items and putting them in the dishwasher.  Oh, feeling all stupid now that it's over.  Right.  There's just something about that release.  That blow-up sheep seemed like a good idea when we were all horned up.  What happened?  But now that we're done, this looks ridiculous.  We were all revved up and saucy.  And now this stuff just looks silly laying here.  You got to throw...  You got to wash it.  It looks like the Seattle Space Needle has chocolate pudding on it. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, God.  Throw that in the dishwasher.  Take the plates out first.  Yeah, you basically have a bunch of utensils you usually use to make chocolate chip cookies.  It's like, what?  What were you thinking?  That seemed like a good idea.  You got to clean up and wash your hands.  Yeah, well.  This article about how to keep them interested after sex.  You know, if you're in a really good relationship, you don't mind that your guy's, you know, crashing after sex.  Yeah.  Half the time the women want to crash after sex. 
[00:55:30]  Of course.  You just had to start cleaning because they got this crazy energy.  What the hell is that about?  Anyway.  Crazy energy.  It's all about just passing out.  But I think if you're in a weird relationship and you're thinking, you know, you need a little  more passion and lovey-dovey stuff, like you're not getting that.  So that's why this article was written.  So you want to try to get him to take a shower with you after you have sex.  Afterwards.  You want to try to have him give you a back rub after sex. 
[00:56:00]  You want to have stimulating conversation after sex.  That's just not happening.  We're not interested.  No.  Chemically, we're not interested.  And you're just a mess after sex, too.  You're just a mess.  There's no massaging or, you know, like I said, when we were talking about it, a shower after sex is purely meant to clean up.  It's not like this sexy thing.  Before sex, a shower, great.  Right.  You know, it gets you in the mood. 
[00:56:30]  All the stuff we just talked about, great before sex.  I'll tell you.  Back rubs.  There's probably nothing better than standing in a shower with your girl and her soaping up her hands and washing you a little bit.  That's like, wow.  That's a great moment.  But after sex, you want to go into hiding.  No, and it looks bad.  That's what I mean.  You're squatting like a caveman, just scrubbing areas that don't see the light of day.  Like I said the other day, you're doing the soap scoop. 
[00:57:00]  The soap scoop.  You got one leg up.  Right.  You're like Captain Morgan.  One leg up and you're scrubbing away.  After sex.  You're taking a mustache on, you're wiping one off.  After sex, though, guys want to go into hiding because you don't have good presentation.  The last thing you want to do is, you know, be nude.  You've lost all.  Presentation.  Yeah, presentation. 
[00:57:30]  You've lost what makes a ballpark Frank so nice when you cook them.  That's true.  Standing like a shivering infant.  Gunk all over you.  It sucks.  Let's go to Venetia.  Venetia?  Venetia?  What's your name there?  Doll?  Huh?  Venetia.  Venetia.  Ugh.  Why Venetia?  How the hell should I know my mother named me that?  You don't like that name?  I've never heard the name Venetia before.  She was named after blinds. 
[00:58:00]  Venetian blinds, Kenny.  Please hold.  There you go.  You're listening in Buffalo?  Oh, yeah.  I would guess that you're close to a fruit street.  Nah, nah.  I'm a fruit belt.  I just went local there.  Did you?  Yeah.  Nice.  Nice.  Thank you.  Trying to be a little more local for our syndicated markets.  Hey, Venetia.  They got that in Buffalo.  Trust me.  So, Venetia, what do you got?  Yes, sir.  What do you got?  Well, I heard you talking about the women's magazines, and you wanted a woman's point of view on it. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  What magazines do you buy, first of all?  Neither.  Oh.  I don't bother with them.  They make no sense to me.  They make no sense?  No.  Do women talk about them, though, to each other at work or when you're out?  Do they say, oh, I read this in Cosmo, and it's a great way to make your man happy?  Well, it's mostly the ditzy broads that read it, though.  Ditsy broads.  I like this, Venetia.  Hey, Venetia. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  You do understand that guys need to fall asleep after sex, right?  Well, there's a lot of work involved.  You can go to sleep.  I think women need to understand that chemically, we need to fall asleep after we, you know, complete.  What they don't seem to get is the things that, like, we do to get you in bed, we don't want to do once we've accomplished that.  Right.  Like, talking.  Why don't you just say, tell more funny stories that he'll feign interest in.  No.  That's what I did to get you there.  They got it all backwards. 
[00:59:30]  Mission accomplished.  Now just be happy I'm not making you sleep on the throw rug by the front door.  All right, Venetia, so you think it's nonsense, huh?  Complete and total nonsense.  If you want to know what a guy wants, just go ahead and ask him after a few beers.  By the way, what do you prefer to do right after sex?  Sleep or play video games.  Wow.  Holla.  She's a dream come true, this one.  Are you a holler girl? 
[01:00:00]  Please.  I'm not ghetto.  I'm educated.  Yeah.  But you're an African princess, right?  I'm me.  I don't buy into that crap.  Well, are you, the name Venetia.  Yeah, it's obvious.  Yeah, I'm black and Brazilian, so.  Oh, nice.  Damn.  Nice.  Nice ass, right?  Yeah.  Yes, sir.  You got that extra body part.  Extra body part.  Yeah, there's something going on.  All right, Jimmy, the Greek.  You see what you do.  It's the Brazilian gets the nice ass. 
[01:00:30]  Right.  It's that all that year's a carnival.  Some of you women got that shelf, man.  What is that about?  Yep.  The white broads from Long Island don't have that, I'll tell you that much.  No.  They do, but it's their hair.  Right.  Hey, wait, are you from Brazil or are you from here?  I'm from here.  Basically, my dad was from the main part of Brazil.  I can't remember the name.  Sao Paulo?  Yeah, Sao Paulo. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  There's something going on, man.  Black girls love this radio show.  We don't understand why.  It's because of me.  I have a ghetto appeal.  I have a hip-hop type of guy.  Yeah, it's definitely Jimmy.  It's a little Jimmy Norton.  There's something very, very urban and hip about me, I've been told.  You're a thug.  Well, I don't know.  Oh, Ken, don't be fresh.  See, that's thug talk.  All right.  Thank you, Venetia.  Bye, Venetia.  No problem.  All right.  Call us again.  We like you.  All right.  No, you've looked great.  That's a slug.  I can't even make those jokes anymore. 
[01:01:30]  You're ruining everything by losing weight.  Yeah.  You've got to get messy.  Looks all good.  Dude, we're losing a lot of material because you're losing weight.  I'm still a jowly nothing.  Not a jowly nothing.  Fat jowl goose.  Oh, stop.  It's not working anymore.  Sunshine.  Buffalo.  What's up?  A lot of calls from Buffalo.  Hey, man.  Hi, Sunshine.  By the way, Crazy Jim doing a great job running the station over there in Buffalo.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's why we get these calls and stuff.  They got the passion for the radio show.  Love it.  They understand they could call this show. 
[01:02:00]  What's up, Sunshine?  Well, do you have hippie parents?  I'm actually calling to say, you know what?  When you're done, you're done.  That's fine.  And if we're not, we have toys to use.  You can go to sleep.  We can...  Yeah, but you know how degrading that is to a guy to get done and then have you girls  pull out a toy afterwards?  Sometimes we have to have more.  Before and during, toys are fine.  After?  After.  It really makes us feel like we didn't do the job.  How do you think I feel after sex? 
[01:02:30]  All right, you talk.  Why would I chime in?  Go right ahead.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  Didn't mean to interrupt.  Go.  Your turn.  Go.  What are you saying?  All right, I didn't mean to chime in.  I was just trying to make a joke.  But as we all know, there's humorous timing.  And you jump right in.  It's all about your timing.  I didn't mean to try to chime in.  I apologize.  It's all about you.  Go.  What do you got?  Go.  Yeah, Sunshine, we're still waiting.  Waiting for the answer to Anthony's question.  Yeah.  Did you have hippie parents?  I'm trying to tell you, but you won't be quiet.  All right, answer my question then.  No, that's what we started with about two minutes ago.  Have her answer my question then. 
[01:03:00]  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Sunshine.  Go.  Go.  I had a great session the other day.  I didn't ask you that.  See, you're not even listening.  I'm trying to tell you.  We want the answer to Anthony's question.  What's the answer?  What's your question?  Ah, so you didn't hear it, did you?  Do you have hippie parents?  Yes.  Did you have hippie parents?  And that's why you're named Sunshine.  No, I do not.  I'm just saying my name is Sunshine because I'm driving in my work truck right now, and  I don't want anyone to know it's me on the radio.  What are you?  Large Marge.  Tell them Large Marge sent ya. 
[01:03:30]  Well, if you work with a chick, I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  I don't exist.  It's all about you.  You're God.  It's your world.  I apologize.  I'm just stupid Abraham trying to chime in about not wanting to slay my son, but you  go ahead.  You block out all orders.  You must be a card on the old CB radio.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, she's the worst.  No, actually, I drive around a food truck.  We didn't need a real answer.  Go ahead.  Sunshine, what's going on?  You drive a fruit truck?  A food truck.  Oh, like you go to the job sites? 
[01:04:00]  Kind of.  Wait, one of those coffee trucks or something?  Kind of.  Where the sides flip open and all the workers come and get egg sandwiches and coffee?  Yeah.  Yes.  By the way, kind of.  That's exactly what it is.  By the way, I said crazy Jim.  It's evil Jim.  I'm an idiot.  Thank you.  Thank you, Steve C.  I got it mixed up with crazy Jim from our born days.  It's evil Jim.  Yes.  Doing a great job with the Buffalo Station.  Sunshine.  All right.  Go ahead.  Continue with your babble.  With my babble.  I can't even get a word in edgewise. 
[01:04:30]  Anyway.  You can't.  I love this girl.  Steven C. is like, hey, it's time for the sun to set on this boring.  I listen to your show every day.  Where's any clips when you need it?  Right.  Go ahead, Sunshine.  I listen to your show every day.  Thank you.  And you're talking about all this.  Do you actually listen to the show?  Every day.  Or do you try to out-talk your radio?  You're giving me skin cancer.  Okay there, Sunshine.  You gave us legions all over our body.  Go ahead.  What do you got?  Yeah.  We'll let you talk.  The thing is that sometimes women need a lot more. 
[01:05:00]  And we understand that after you're done and you do it a couple times and it's a great  job and you're wonderful, sometimes we need a little bit more.  And if you want to join in, you can.  And if you don't, you can go to sleep.  Is it bad, though?  She almost did it.  She can't help herself.  She did, though.  She can't help herself.  Does anyone have any sunblock?  I need a 50 SPF.  I need a 50 SPF.  I use 45. 
[01:05:30]  Of course you do.  I like to use a 45 on you, too.  Jimmy, you were going to comment?  Yeah, this will work.  Okay, Jimmy.  What?  Oh, my God.  You're the worst.  When it comes to talking to someone on the phone doing a radio show, you're the worst.  Well, that's okay.  All right.  All right.  Let Jimmy talk.  All right.  It's just back like 20 minutes ago, I was just going to chime in with, I don't even remember.  It was a joke alluding to the fact that, is it bad after I go to sleep? 
[01:06:00]  My girlfriend goes to the basement and meets a few of the maintenance men.  I don't even remember where I was going to go with that.  I'll tell you where you're going with it, into a wall, into an abutment.  Sunshine was trying to save me from that awful bomb, and my apologies.  And, Sunshine, you know, your man's not doing it right if you're using toys after the...  We use them together during, also.  What do you...  What does he use on you besides a ball gag?  Okay, can I say this on the radio? 
[01:06:30]  I don't know if I...  What's the first letter?  All right, hold on.  Let's play what's the first letter.  It begins with a D.  Double.  Okay, we understand now.  What?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Double.  A double D?  Yeah, yeah, we're not talking bra size either.  Right.  We understand.  So now you and your husband, is it?  No.  No, it's just her using it like the letter U.  Is it a boyfriend or a girl? 
[01:07:00]  It's a boy.  Okay, so you and a boy use a...  A double D?  A double with him?  Well, he uses his, and we use another two.  Right.  It's, let's just say, it's an extra limb.  Yeah, but nothing, let's say, he isn't involved with that other thing.  No, absolutely not.  Okay, all right.  Well, you said you use toys together. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  Are you using something on him?  No, no, no, on me.  I thought you were interfacing a couple and exchange data.  The data cable.  A couple hard drives.  Yes, yes, linked up together in a network.  Yikes.  A hardwired network.  Yeah, well, you said it.  You led us to believe.  What?  No, it's on me, not on him.  Right, okay.  Right, right, right.  So you like that.  Except he shoves it in her mouth so she can't talk. 
[01:08:00]  That's where the other end goes.  All right, there's how you use the double D on sunshine.  Oh, God.  Okay, sunshine.  Sunshine, wow.  All right.  Thank you for the insight.  All right, thanks, guys.  Bye, sunshine.  Have a great day.  I was loving Buffalo until sunshine called.  She means well.  Is it sunny in Buffalo today, sunshine?  Nah, a little bit.  Sun's coming out a little bit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Good luck to you.  All right, thank you.  Keep up your good nature.  All right.  She's a gregarious gal.  Yeah.  Well, she won't shut up. 
[01:08:30]  All right, on the way, so Kenny picked out some articles from the magazines.  What do we got today?  What do we got today to finish up his segment?  We got to finish the 10 sex tips for the older women.  Right, right.  He did promise that during a promo that I didn't even get to hear yesterday here in New York.  Why?  Holy Jesus.  Must have played 80 times.  Oh, really?  Yeah, and I'll continue.  Oh, really?  My sex tips for the elderly.  All right, that's cool.  They're promoting us.  That's something we're not used to, so that's all right. 
[01:09:00]  I just have the station on all the time now.  Yeah.  Here in New York, they went back to rock.  And we're pretty happy about it.  Yeah.  Maybe they can replace some of the Metallica with Tony Orlando and Dawn, but maybe that's  just us.  Our old PD's a bit bitter.  We'll get into that another day.  And then, you know, I got a whole potpourri of information.  I got dating tips for regular women.  That's a potpourri that's retarded. 
[01:09:30]  I got funny conversation starters.  All right.  Potpourri that'll choke you out, Jimmy.  I know.  And I got successful first date tips.  All right.  We'll do that next with Kenny.  Nice.  I want to know where Kenny's going to be on Saturday if I want to congratulate him on  such a good date.  Oh, Kenny.  He's got a appearance on Saturday.  How cute is this?  Thank you for reminding me.  I'll be from noon to 2 p.m. to Circuit City.  I'll be from noon to 2 p.m.  How are you going to be from noon to 2 p.m.?  From noon to 2 p.m.  You are so stupid. 
[01:10:00]  Come see me in all my stupidity-ness.  You know what, though?  He's very excited, though, because when he picked me up yesterday, that was the first  thing he did.  Oh, was it?  I got an appearance, and I'm getting an appearance fee.  Yeah.  That's so cute.  They're paying me monies.  Hopefully, someone will show up this time.  Yeah.  Let's take Snay on that.  All right.  That seems fun.  You just show up, and they pay you for it?  How cool is that?  Yeah.  Gigs.  Yeah.  You don't even need the listeners to show up.  That's the beauty of Club Sword of Kenny when he goes out. 
[01:10:30]  Kenny's going to be with the Tom Tom.  Yeah, Tom Tom GPS at Circuit City, 52 East 14th Street, this Saturday, noon to 2 p.m.  52 East 14th Street.  Is that Union Square?  Yeah.  And they didn't give me the Cross Street.  It's close to Union Square.  Well, you should say Union Square, because that's a huge subway stop, so people would just  know to take the train there.  And people know, all right, I could get there.  That's kind of an easy place to get to.  Well, thank you for bringing that to my attention.  Now I know how I'm going to get there.  And Kenny, all you need is the address, and you put it in your Tom Tom, and it'll take 
[01:11:00]  you right there.  Hopefully, they're going to give me a Tom Tom.  A Tom Tom for a dum-dum.  Julie in Boston listening on WBCN.  What's up, Julie?  Julie.  Hi, Julie.  Stop listening to the radio and be part of the radio, Julie.  Oh, are you talking to me?  Yes.  I'm listening to her.  She's babbling.  Julie's from Boston. 
[01:11:30]  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  I got a problem here.  You're still listening to Sunshine on the radio right there?  Isn't that amazing, the delay?  I was trying to catch up.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Will you just go with this for a second?  Were you just listening to...  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  You were listening to Sunshine on the radio?  What kind of delay do we have?  A long one.  We're on a 38-hour delay in Boston.  That's messing up our phone calls, because by the time we want to go to phone calls on  subjects, we're into commercials.  Yeah.  That's a long delay.  All right, go ahead, Julie.  What do you got on Sunshine? 
[01:12:00]  I know.  She just sounds like no one wants to give it to her.  That's why she's got to use all those toys.  Well, some women like toys.  I mean, I personally haven't really experimented with them, but a lot of women like them.  Yeah, it's tough.  Are you the kind of guy, Jim, that feels intimidated by anything else that might  pleasure the woman in bed?  No, I just don't care.  Aside from your manliness?  No.  No?  It's irrelevant to me.  Oh, really?  What you want when I'm done.  So you don't care?  Oh, okay.  I don't care.  I purposely live to her a fire hydrant, so it's just not far to walk.  Knock yourself out, toots.  I'm going to doze off.  Give me a breather right, Strip. 
[01:12:30]  Hey, we got an explanation to one of our problems, something we've been discussing behind  the scenes.  Yeah.  There's a minute 36 delay to the network, and then what?  The local delay on every radio station, which is what, another 36 seconds?  They're about two minutes behind.  Wow.  So when the show ends, I'm already on the road screaming racial epithets out my window.  We're trying to have a very interactive show where we want a lot of phone calls, but if  they're two minutes behind, that makes it really tough.  No kidding.  All right.  Anyway, so Sunshine sounds like she doesn't get it, and it also says, it sounds like she's 
[01:13:00]  a hippie that doesn't shave her armpits, that just drives around in her truck, doesn't  shave, don't answer any questions.  I'll tell you something.  Those coffee truck broads, I remember them from my days on the construction sites.  It was usually a guy that would drive around, and you know those trucks, the little hatches  open on the side, and there's rancid food in there for the poor construction guys to 
[01:13:30]  eat and drink and stuff like that.  All sorts of diseases.  Yeah, just horrible egg sandwiches that were made in Central Iceland here on Long Island.  It's just awful.  And they left them in the sun for an hour.  Yeah, just horrible.  And if you'd ever get a female driving one of these, they're like these tough broads.  Oh, my gosh.  Yeah, real tough broad.  Bull dyke.  That's another way to put it.  I don't mind a little armpit hair, to be very honest with you.  Oh, Jimmy.  I swear to God, it can be very... 
[01:14:00]  Do you like French girls?  I don't know.  I don't like it below.  I like hair on the...  I can tolerate it if it's the right vibe for the girl.  Armpit hair?  No.  I've actually...  So, so creepy.  It depends on the girl and why she has it.  There was years ago, this little hippie chick who I wanted to sleep with badly until she  got it with her dirty bare feet and got gum on the seat of my Saturn.  Dirty bare feet, hairy armpits.  But she was sexy, though. 
[01:14:30]  She was young.  She was like 20 or 19 or whatever.  And she had like little hairy pits.  The bohemian chick?  Yeah, but she was clean and there was just something just sexy about her.  Yeah?  That can be very sexy.  As long as it's not some awful ugly chick or a tranny.  Like Patti Smith or whatever her name is.  Was that her?  No, Stalker Patti.  No, no.  Patti Smith?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's got the armpit hair.  She had the big hairy armpits.  The because the night lady?  Yeah.  Because the night...  All right. 
[01:15:00]  We got to take a break.  Club Soda Kenny with his advice.  All right, but I got to run and get your food during the commercials.  Oh, boy.  Now there's a problem.  Are you kidding?  We need you.  I'm running.  All right.  All right.  Go, go, go, go, go.  All right.  When we get back...  Let's see him run.  Club Soda Kenny.  Also, let's not forget Michael Chiklis in studio today.  Yes, The Thing.  What?  From Fantastic Four.  Oh, okay.  That's right.  And from The Shield.  That's right.  Mm-hmm.  A show I've never seen, actually, but I heard everyone around here is obsessed with it. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, it was an amazing show.  One of those shows that kind of...  It was really one of those first shows that broke that barrier from basic cable using really  heinous language and stuff and really surprising and shocking people.  Mm-hmm.  They'd be like, wait, wait a minute.  It's not HBO or something?  And he just said that?  He was in The Commish, too?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was The Commish.  Oh, I don't like the name of The Commish.  That's why I never saw it.  The Commish.  I think we talked to him when he was doing that show, right?  Way back in the day.  Yeah.  He was really good to us back in the day when I first started doing radio together. 
[01:16:00]  Out in L.A., I believe we talked to him when he used to have hair.  Right.  Used to have the hair.  All right.  We got it.  We're just babbling.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Club Soda Kenny next.  Emily and I came up with something years ago.  Basically, it says,  Whip them out Wednesday.  Big, luscious, juicy ones.  Great.  Wow.  The swinging tribute to unrestrained female anatomy.  Wow.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:16:30]  92.  Hey, Rocky.  Oh, man.  Too bad it's not Air Guitar Friday.  Oh, this would have been perfect.  It's not better.  It's Tap Along Tuesday.  No, it's Whip them out Wednesday.  Oh, Tap Along Tuesday was yesterday.  Where we tap to the music.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I want to thank the broads that are flashing us on Pal Talk.  Thank you, broads.  What broads? 
[01:17:00]  Queer Rock only has like one thing open.  Queer Rock has men up.  It is Whip them out Wednesday.  It's alive and well on Pal Talk especially.  Get the wow in your car and join the festivities.  There are women out there that will see the wow and they will flash you.  It stands for Whip them out Wednesday.  Just don't harass the ladies.  They don't want you.  They just want to give you a nice little quick treat on the way to work.  That's it.  Okay.  Club Soda Kenny, let's get into this.  So you went through the female magazines.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:17:30]  You know, they're just chock full of tips for the women out there.  The broads.  Yeah.  So, you know, there's a lot of senior citizens.  So I tried to include them also.  So yesterday we left off with sex tips for older women, right?  Yes.  Okay.  And they're supposed to be doing a favor for the elderly.  And from reading this, it just makes you want to kill yourself before you get older.  Sure.  Because we brought this up yesterday.  Sex, when you first start getting sexually active, is probably the most exciting thing ever, ever, ever. 
[01:18:00]  And then through your entire life.  Hold on, hold on.  It's so great.  It makes you blow off Little League and everything.  Yeah.  Everything that was the most important things in your life as a kid.  All of a sudden, your skateboard just doesn't matter as much.  Thrown out the window.  And your entire existence, for years and years to come, is nothing but getting sex.  Right, right.  It's just getting that sex.  And get all your little play toys and all your hobbies right out the window. 
[01:18:30]  Your little bicycle you've been working on, you know.  Doesn't matter.  Banana seat.  Building that plane with Dad.  Dad.  Yeah, all of a sudden, all that stuff goes in the garage and then gathers dust and cobwebs.  And then...  I have discovered the power of the poop.  Oh!  Exactly.  And then you read what the elderly have to go through to keep an active, healthy sex life.  And they try to present it like this is a good thing.  Hey, you're still, you know, you could still have an active, fun, healthy, erotic sex life well into your 80s and even 90s. 
[01:19:00]  And then you read what they've got to go through.  Ugh!  Talk with your partner.  Communicate problems that you have, difficulties with your sex, and try to solve them.  Work together to find creative solutions.  What, a splint and duct tape?  What kind of creative solutions are you working together to find?  And then when number two has to just say lubricate. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, wow.  You know there's going to be a problem.  Yeah.  Experiment with positions and times.  Because at some times of the day, your arthritis is hurting more than others.  Also, arthritis and other pain conditions are often less severe at certain times of the day.  Dealing with ED, you know, that dysfunction that men have, and how to troubleshoot this problem.  They make it sound like a problem with your breaker box downstairs.  It needs some troubleshooting.  You know what the problem is? 
[01:20:00]  Not that it's bad to have sex when you're old.  It's the way people just refuse to be honest.  Uh-huh.  Sure, your body changes as you age, but that does not reflect on your worth or desirability.  But as I said yesterday, it does.  It does.  You're not as desirable when you're old.  It's just a fact of life.  We're not doing this to intentionally be mean.  No.  It just, that's the way it is.  You ever see these commercials for, like, Centrum Silver or these other things where old people are riding their bicycles, and one of them will say something like, these are the best years of my life. 
[01:20:30]  That's like, what, were you in a concentration camp?  Because that's the only way these are the best years of your life.  Because it just isn't.  Were you in a coma from 18 to 49?  Oh, yeah, I remember 18 was a bitch, my prostate was the size of a pineapple, and I could only make half staff at any given moment.  No, you know what I say.  What, Kenny?  What do you say?  All chickens make good soup.  You said that yesterday.  You really thought it was going to work today? 
[01:21:00]  It didn't work yesterday.  Come on, here goes your chicken.  It's the truth.  Kenny never met a cliche he couldn't love and repeat.  Boner-nosed, beanie-wearing Jew boy.  Oh, wow.  God, the news is getting provocative these days.  They sure are.  So we continue with sex tips for older women.  Yeah.  Go ahead there, Kenny.  Sex after surgery.  See, now this falls exactly into the category I was just talking about. 
[01:21:30]  Sex after surgery.  These are the best years of my life.  Are they?  Yeah, because, you know, as women age, they may need to undergo surgical procedures that alter their reproductive organs.  That's wonderful.  That's what you need.  The golden years, they call them that because that's the color of your undergarments.  That's why I see a lot of old people at diners.  They know. 
[01:22:00]  It's just...  They know.  At least we still have our desire to eat stuff.  Just stop already.  After surgery.  The most common are...  Wow.  Mastectomy.  Yeah, and hysterectomy.  Hysterectomy.  Hysterectomy.  That's where they take it all.  Hysterectomy.  You might as well take it.  These surgeries do not have to interfere with a woman's ability to have sex.  However, these procedures can dramatically change how a woman perceives her own attractiveness. 
[01:22:30]  And how other people perceive you.  I'm not saying that you can't have sex after these things, but other people don't perceive you the same either.  Well, James, if you have open communication with your partner before and after these procedures, it can help and reduce anxiety and negativity.  Oh, really?  After a hysterectomy and she's got a beard like Castro, it's going to reduce the stress and tension?  Remove the ovaries.  Sorry. 
[01:23:00]  That's what it says.  Yeah.  All right.  It doesn't do you say that.  Yes.  It says removal of the ovary and sometimes the ovary.  That wasn't the part that didn't go over.  Yeah.  I'm trying to really deflect from that one.  Hoof.  Hoofa.  Next, most importantly, we must practice safe sex.  God bless you.  Yuck.  Safe sex.  Yeah.  Because, you know, sexually transmitted infections, including the HIV, are on the rise in older adults. 
[01:23:30]  Older adults have had more time to develop a sexual history.  Also, many infections can remain dormant for years in people.  Do not assume that an older sexual partner is a safe sexual partner.  Always practice safe sex.  Wow.  Thank you, Kenny.  If you're 75 and you think you might have AIDS.  And you're worried about catching something. 
[01:24:00]  Whoever you're having sex with, here's the thing.  If they're as old as you are and they have AIDS, it's okay.  Because, obviously, you're both – if it's a 10-year incubation and you're 78, just throw caution to the wind.  Knock yourself out.  What, is he going to ruin 89 to 90?  What happened?  And then, Liam.  That didn't make it through, Kenny.  Well, who – that's not Kenny's fault.  Who went over this and doesn't tell me that? 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, well –  That's a taboo word.  Yeah, Kenny, you can't say that.  Taboo.  So old people should – you know, there's always –  There's always – if you're alone –  Turtles of a trade.  Let's say you're a widow or a widower.  And there's a lot of lonely nights spent in your own bed all alone, you have to learn how to deal with that situation and maybe make yourself feel good with either some type of instrument or just the basics, whatever you got left. 
[01:25:00]  Those arthritic hands, perhaps.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony's show, we're going to get an old broad.  An old broad, an old gal.  An old gal to do exactly that for us.  Oh.  No, we're not.  Oh, how cool.  Old broad over – I would say over – I think we have to go 16 and above on that one.  Definitely.  The big 6-0 on that one.  All right, moving on, Kenny. 
[01:25:30]  What else did you find in the women's magazines?  You want to talk about funny conversation starters?  Yes.  All right.  Funny conversation starters.  All right, so this is advice for women out there to help them get some men?  Yeah, say you're in a certain situation, like you're in a men's clothing store and notice an attractive woman looking at a blue shirt.  You could say, hey, blue probably isn't your color.  If you really want to wear men's clothes, try pink. 
[01:26:00]  You're too girly for blue.  Who's laughing at that?  All right, wait, wait, wait.  Holy Jesus, as you get mace sprayed in your face.  So this is funny conversation starters for guys?  Yeah.  To hit on a girl.  All right.  Wait, hold on.  You're in a men's clothing store and notice an attractive woman looking at a blue shirt.  Now, if you're in a men's store, first of all, and she's looking at a shirt, she's probably, like, hooked up.  She's probably with a guy.  Yeah.  And looking for clothes for him.  Yeah, so they're basically telling you how you can get some other guy's clothing. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, try to wheel in on some other guy's chick with probably the worst line ever.  Yeah.  Can we do something here?  Can we role play a little bit?  Oh, sure.  I would like someone to play the gentleman, and I just want to play the beautiful lady.  Oh, I think Kenny should be the gentleman.  Kenny, I'm clothes shopping.  Hey, toots.  No, no, no.  Oh, sorry.  Stick to the script.  Yeah, yeah.  What are you, improv-ing?  Are you crazy?  What is this, an indie movie?  Yes, this is not madness.  Hey, blue probably isn't your color.  If you really want to wear men's clothes, try pink. 
[01:27:00]  You're too girly for blue.  Die.  Wait a minute.  Yeah.  But before the great line from Jimmy that I stepped all over.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  He's acting.  You've got to act it out.  Don't read it.  Yeah, you're just reading.  Stand up.  You're a terrible actor.  Like, all right, picture you're in a men's clothing store.  Let's go.  There's Jimmy.  He's looking at...  I've got to get a most sexy pose.  Yeah, Jamie's looking at blue shirts there.  Let's go.  Hey, you know, blue probably isn't your color. 
[01:27:30]  If you really want to wear men's clothes, try pink.  You're too girly for blue.  Thanks.  What do you mean by that?  He's got nothing.  Are you crazy?  You know, you're hot stuff.  You see, you had to prove that the conversation starter, even if it starts, you're still left  on your own number two.  Right, they leave you hanging.  Hey, Sheila from Long Island.  What's up? 
[01:28:00]  How you doing, guys?  What's up?  Good job.  Yeah, what do you got?  You're absolutely right.  Women getting older, it's totally sucking.  Let me tell you.  Is it?  How old a gal are you, Sheila?  You know, it's only 55, but it's, you know, it's only going to go downhill, you know, literally.  Are you going through the change?  I'm sorry?  Are you going through the change that women go through?  Oh, definitely, and it sucks the big ween-ween.  What are you getting?  Are you getting the hot flashes?  Oh, the hot flashes, the mood swings, fist drops, this is dry, that's not dry, this is 
[01:28:30]  not dry, it's just, you know.  Something is dropping?  No, they're all dropping, baby.  It all drops.  Everything's dropping?  I thought you said, this is dry, this is not dry.  Yeah, she did say that.  And the part that is dry was supposed to be not dry, and the stuff that was not dry is  now...  What?  All of the above.  All right, so all sorts of crap is going on with your body.  And Sheila.  Yeah.  Sheila, do you recall, of course you do, but do you recall... 
[01:29:00]  Hey, hey, watch your language, young lady.  I love her.  You're right, I forget we're on the radio.  Yeah.  Probably.  And how thrilling and exciting was that?  Oh, as thrilling as you can go.  Screaming and screaming and just having a good old time.  Yeah, and now...  Now, you're lucky if you get a croak out of me.  Oh, wow.  Get a croak out of her.  See, it's all the young broads out there, use what you got. 
[01:29:30]  I'm telling you.  You're entering your silver years.  It's the best years of your life.  Huh?  You want to choke those perculine broads?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're drinking their old people supplement shake, saying, this is fantastic.  They show them riding bikes and canoeing.  Yeah.  That's what they want to be doing.  Yeah.  You need to take a whole bottle of centrum even just to get out of bed, for Christ's  sake.  You see the commercial...  I love CLA.  You see the commercial that's on now with the guys with the urinary problems? 
[01:30:00]  That's what it's all about.  And they're drinking bottled water and riding a bicycle, or they're canoeing or something  like that.  And it just shows the guy going to the bathroom, and he's all annoyed with himself.  And then I guess he sees his doctor and gets these pills.  And then he's just having a great time.  But he's still...  You know, his friends are just like, oh, here comes...  Oh, God.  Here comes the guy that's constantly going to the bathroom.  And the next commercial will come on TV as it depends, because that's what you're going  to need.  So do you still... 
[01:30:30]  Sheila, do you still get action?  Do you want action?  Are you married?  What's up with you?  Everything's going on.  It's fine.  It's just that, you know, it ain't all joy.  This commercial...  You know, that's why you have remote control.  Change that channel, because you're all a bunch of lying hoo-hoo's.  All right.  She don't like...  See?  She don't like getting old.  All right.  I'm sorry, Sheila, that you're getting old.  That's all right.  As long as I can listen to you guys, I can stay so young.  All right, Sheila, you poor old broad.  I know.  Bye, guys.  All right. 
[01:31:00]  These...  Conversation starters?  This is almost like a parody of awful things to say.  Yeah, this is...  But this isn't like someone trying to be funny.  This is stuff that they think will help people get some conversations going.  And I like these specific situations that you have to be in.  Right.  You're in a supermarket by the chicken, and she picks up a leg, and you...  It's like, when is this going to happen?  Yes.  You're standing outside a Planned Parenthood issuing a parking ticket. 
[01:31:30]  She's tear-stricken.  Go ahead, Kenny.  What's the next conversation starter?  Well, number two is you're in a supermarket and see a woman with nice hair next to shampoos  and conditioners.  Mm-hmm.  And the guy says, hey there, now you might be able to help me.  No.  Go away.  That's not...  Anthony, I think that's a bit harsh.  Oh, okay.  Well, that's what she would say.  I think...  Oh, Jimmy wants to step in? 
[01:32:00]  Okay.  I think that you're being a bit harsh.  I think that's a smooth line.  All right, do it again with a little more emotion behind that one, Kenny.  Hey there.  Now, you might be able to help me.  I'd love to help you to our Bud Dwyer's lunch bag.  Well, you see, you got nice shiny hair, and I use, you know, a shampoo.  What do you use on your hair, sod? 
[01:32:30]  But it just ain't working for me.  What do you use on your hair to get your hair looking that good?  And then there's a little note here.  This will work even if you're bald, as it'll be funny.  No, it won't.  All right.  How funny would it be, though, if he says, what the hell do you use to get your hair 
[01:33:00]  looking that good?  And her response is, the blood of children.  Well, that is a funny conversation starter.  Do we have another one, Kenny?  Of course.  You are.  The next one, you're in a takeaway store.  What?  What's a takeaway store?  I don't know.  What the hell is a takeaway store?  Everybody fumbles.  And are standing near or next to a woman waiting to be served.  I don't know.  Takeout food. 
[01:33:30]  Takeaway.  Takeaway.  Maybe it's a Toys R Us.  The person behind the counter.  Kidnapping reference.  Thank you, Anthony.  All right, you're in a takeaway store and standing near or next to a woman waiting to  be served.  The person behind the counter gestures for the next customer, and the woman looks at you  for approval to go first.  You say, you see, it's gentlemen before ladies in the modern world.  Her response could be the greatest thing ever written.  It's H-A exclamation point. 
[01:34:00]  Ha!  Ha!  Back to you.  I'm just kidding.  You go first.  I heard gallantry is back these days, so I better do my bit.  Can we redo that again?  I didn't.  I was off cue.  Oh.  This is the way it would really work in the real world.  This is very realistic.  Yeah, let's go.  You.  Oh, you see, it's gentlemen before ladies in the modern world.  Ha!  I'm just kidding.  You go first.  I heard gallantry is back these days, so I better do my bit. 
[01:34:30]  Interesting.  What is the modern world, by the way?  That stupid man hitting on me?  Modern world.  Modern world.  Modern world.  And why are you hitting on Jimmy, by the way?  You creep?  Who doesn't?  All right.  And these are real conversation starters.  This is helping people out there.  All right.  How about the next one?  How about the next one?  You're in a bookstore, and you see a woman checking out a book.  You.  Ah.  Good to see I have another fan.  And then the girl looks at me all confused, and then I say, that was my third book, that 
[01:35:00]  one.  You read the others?  And the title is Living with AIDS.  Yeah.  Well, that's a little different, because then it would have said, then the you would have  been, that was my first and last book.  Secret agent man.  Secret agent man.  All right.  All right.  All right.  And of course, conversation starter, this is an easy one, because you're in a bar. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, let's go.  It's easy.  You're in a bar.  You.  Right.  Hey, I thought I'd come over and say hi.  I'm Kenny.  So, who are you?  Hi, I'm Jenny.  Yeah.  Hi, Jenny.  I tell you what.  I'm liking this bar.  Awesome vibe in here.  You been here long?  And that's it?  This is the.  How odd is it?  That's it?  How odd is it for a Jenny to confront someone actually dumber than Forrest? 
[01:36:00]  This is actual stuff that was in a magazine.  That is it.  It doesn't even say conversation starter number one for that one.  It says great conversation starter.  So, that's a great conversation starter.  Yeah.  Here's the same type of line.  Hey, come here often?  That's like one of those.  Well.  Hack. 
[01:36:30]  And then the article ends.  Hey, toots.  The article ends.  Shake a leg.  Yeah, the article ends.

For all the people still listening to the show, you have to be a faithful listener, so we're  going to give you some tickets to the O&A Traveling Virus Comedy Tour.  Kenny was great.  No, I'm just kidding, Kenny.  Kenny did terrific. 
[01:37:30]  Ten days out, June 16th, Jones Beach.  Eight or nine comedians you know and love from this very show.  We got the videos.  We got Ant and I on stage.  We'll be bringing up guests of our own.  You got the O&A Village with all sorts of things going on, including karaoke, hopefully a video  confessional.  You got the dunking booth with the crazy clown guy.  Dance, dance, revolution machine.  Dance, dance, revolution.  You got the O&A Pest Booth, hopefully.  All that is just in the village before the show.  Then before that, you got the tailgating that happens in the parking lot.  And then before that, they usually get together at rest areas all over the tri-state area. 
[01:38:00]  So, Jones Beach, ten days out, June 16th, get your tickets through Ticketmaster.com.  For all the info on the tour, go to VirusTour, one word, VirusTour on MySpace, because we're  coming to a bunch of cities, but we're focusing on Jones Beach at this particular time.  Brought to you by Bud Light, always worth it.  We'll give a pair of tickets to a random caller right now, okay?  Make sure you can use the tickets.  When we get back, we got Michael Chiklis coming in.  Good.  Nice.  Talking about the Fantastic Four or Fantastic Four. 
[01:38:30]  Also, we started this yesterday, and we're on to something.  We hate sports announcers with their goofy home run calls or whatever, just their dumb  calls in general.  And someone turned us on to Rick Generette.  I think that's how you say his name.  He's the announcer for the Buffalo Sabres.  We got some great audio of him just being stupid.  Is he a tool?  Yeah, he's definitely a tool.  And this will get the rest of America motivated enough to send in their sports calls, okay? 
[01:39:00]  Very good.  So we'll do a little of that next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's Whip-A-Mouth Wednesday.  Get a wow sticker.  Get flashed.  Get happy.  God forbid we mention a website.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Lisa, the sales girl, just came in.  She said that she was very entertained on the way into work today.  And she laughed when we said that there are some women out there that have a lot of energy  after sex.  Guys, probably every single guy just wants to crash right after sex, right? 
[01:39:30]  But there are women that it has the opposite effect.  And all of a sudden, they got this energy.  I got to clean.  I got to clean.  I got to go.  I got to bake.  I got to bake.  Bake?  Ew.  Whatever.  But they have just this crazy energy out of nowhere.  So then I was picturing Lisa, the sales girl after sex with that awful voice of hers.  Oh, what do you mean?  I want to snuggle.  Let's cuddle.  Now, Lisa's not the type of girl that wants to snuggle after sex.  No.  No way.  She'll belt you in the face to knock you out so she can sleep. 
[01:40:00]  She probably wants to do like Pilates or something.  Pilates.  Let's go do Pilates.  Pilates.  Wake up.  Let's try to do Pilates.  I got this energy.  Oh, there you go.  And see, she has enough energy.  I'm sure she got it good this morning.  Now she's giving us the finger.  She's climbing the wall.  Go do your Pilates and sell something, will you? 
[01:40:30]  Where's, uh...  Oh, here she comes.  You're going to get in trouble.  What?  I'll kiss my ass.  Oh, no, you didn't.  No, you didn't.  Go kiss my ass.  Anyway.  Ah, Mr. Sheffield.  But some women, you know, they get the energy, the crazy energy.  Like, what the F is going on?  Go to sleep.  All right.  Where's Michael Chiklis?  8.30, Jimmy. 
[01:41:00]  8.30.  Oh, I thought it was 8.15.  No, no, no, no.  We're going to do a little Sterling, and we're going to have Rick Jenneret, I believe that's  how you say his name, for the Buffalo Sabres taking on John Sterling.  Taking on?  Yeah.  Is this like Battle of the Announcers?  Well, you know...  Battle of the Douche Announcers.  Well, now we got Pittsburgh chiming in.  It's all about Pittsburgh this morning.  Pittsburgh.  Acknowledging that we're on in Pittsburgh today.  And a lot of people from Pittsburgh saying, you better get some Mike Lang clips.  Yeah.  Mike Lang will beat all these guys. 
[01:41:30]  We're in a major competition now.  It has begun.  All the cities think their guy is the douchiest.  Well, John Sterling, you know, he's the Yankee guy, and he just comes up with just dumb  nicknames.  Here, Jimmy, which ones you want to play?  Just a few.  Oof.  Just tell me which track, just to give you an idea, and then we'll get into Rick Jenneret's  calls.  They all want to be...  Sorry, Jim.  They all want to be bigger than the game itself.  They want their announcing to be bigger than what's happening on the field.  So they come up with catchphrases, little words for everything from a single to a home 
[01:42:00]  run, little phrases for the players.  Yeah.  So it's ridiculous.  Let the game be the star.  What's the one we played yesterday about the cookie?  The 3-2 cookie.  Do we have that?  I forgot.  Was that a Sterling call?  The 3-2 cookie.  Oh, it's the latest one?  Yeah, well, we got the latest Sterling call that drove us nuts.  Hold on.  Let me play this from yesterday, Jimmy.  Then we'll play a couple classics, and then we'll move on to Rick Jenneret. 
[01:42:30]  My head is itching from reading these.  All right, yeah.  That's bad.  Just highlight a couple that you want us to play, but this is one that drove us nuts yesterday.  Here's the payoff.  Swung on, hit high in the air to deep right field.  That ball is high.  It is far.  It is gone.  Johnny Damon opens the game with a long home run.  He got a 3-2 cookie from Litch, and hit it in the second deck in right field.  A Damon dinger, and the Yankees take a 1-0 lead. 
[01:43:00]  A Damon dinger.  He was subdued, but coming up with the 3-2 cookie.  3-2 cookie.  I gave you five.  These are very short.  Five?  All right, we got five short ones from Sterling, just so the rest of the country gets the idea.  It was hard picking awful ones.  Yeah.  Because they're all just so horrible.  And these are the Yankees.  This is not a small market team.  Mm-hmm.  And then we got to decide who's the worst.  It's a crappy team, but it's not a small market team.  Who's the worst trying to come up with these catchphrases?  Yeah.  Here's one.  Now, the right-hander is set to be a 2-2 to Giambi. 
[01:43:30]  The pitch is swung on and hit in the air to deep right.  It is high.  It is far.  It is gone.  A walk-off two-run.  Bottom of the 10th home run by Jason Giambi.  The Giambino.  Yankees win.  Yankees over.  Yankees win.  The Yankees win.  Look, man.  We're being hurt all over America.  Good luck to the rest of America beating out John Sterling for being ridiculous. 
[01:44:00]  Hey, give the guy a break.  He hasn't been able to do the Yankees win thing in a while.  Well, last night, right?  They win last night?  Yeah.  Who in the Yankee organization?  He hasn't been able to do it that often.  Who tells him that's good?  That it's good.  High, far, gone was great in that one.  Yeah.  He didn't know if it was going out.  And a 2-1 home run walk-off for Jason Giambi.  Why do you need the Giambino?  The Giambino.  Here's another one.  The pitch is swung on and there it goes to deep right.  It is high. 
[01:44:30]  It is far.  It is gone.  He's done it again.  He's done it again.  The Bantino.  Ah.  Well, I don't believe it and I'm seeing it.  I don't believe I'm hearing it.  I've missed a game with the Yanks in 17 years.  I haven't seen anything like this.  Constantino Martinez of Tampa, Florida has hit his second home run of the game.  A two-run home run.  Ties the game at three.  Unbelievable. 
[01:45:00]  You've never seen a game tied at three?  Bamchino.  Bamchino.  The Bam Doucho made that announcement.  Hey, Steve G from Whack Pack.  He's saying that Rick Generette, we're going to get into him in a second here, is a god in Buffalo.  The old drunk is beloved.  There are stories of him not doing games without a bottle of Jack in the 80s.  Ah, nice.  That's a...  All right.  Here's another one.  The two-two.  There it goes to deep right field.  It is high.  It is far.  It is gone. 
[01:45:30]  In the upper deck.  Positively demonic.  Johnny Damon ties the game.  With an upper deck.  Belt blast into the upper deck and right.  And the Yankees tie the game at one.  Positively demonic.  Demonic.  That's good.  And then you got this.  The two-one.  Swung on.  Hit high in the air.  The deep left.  That ball is high.  Middle score.  And it is gone. 
[01:46:00]  It is a three-run home run from Andy Phillips.  Fill it up.  Phillips.  It's a three-run home run.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, look.  And he turns a bucket fastball around.  The hairs on my arm just stood up.  And the Yankees take a four-two lead.  Fill it up.  What did you fill up?  The deuce quota?  Why would...  Why fill it up, Phillips?  What is that?  What?  So, there you go.  We challenge the rest of you guys out there to come up with someone that's wackier and crazier 
[01:46:30]  and whatever.  Oh, is he...  Oh, is he awful?  Than John Sterling.  Dink.  Medify.  Medify.  Medify.  My favorite might be the new one where he says a three-two cookie.  A cookie.  Burn, baby, burn.  He used to do, burn, baby, burn.  That's wonderful.  Why don't you?  With that, literally.  With that, we say hi to Rick Jennerette.  All right.  From Buffalo.  The Buffalo Sabres announcer.  Is he worse than John Sterling?  That's what we have to try to figure out today. 
[01:47:00]  Let's see.  He's got to break away.  Wicca walking right in.  Score!  Michael Becker.  Top shelf where mama hides the cookies.  What did he say?  Where mama hides the cookies.  Top shelf?  Yeah.  Top shelf.  I guess he scored up high in the net.  Yeah, that's a top shelf goal.  Top shelf where mama hides the cookies.  He's ripping off Sterling. 
[01:47:30]  Sterling's got some competition, Jimmy.  And away goes Hitch with Breer.  Heston Breer.  The pass to Breer.  Breer steps.  Shoots.  Go!  The cookie monster strikes the game.  Top shelf Buffalo wins in overtime.  Now, it's not fair because hockey has a little more excitement to begin with. 
[01:48:00]  This guy's a complete ass.  We'll keep it.  I love him.  We'll keep it in mind, man.  Hold on.  I love this guy.  Yeah.  He is a complete ass.  Rick Zitteret.  Score!  Hopefully, tomorrow, we'll have Mike Lang clips from Pittsburgh.  Oh, yeah.  I bet you at home, this guy's a horrible bore.  Like, even in bed, he's probably like, that's it.  Good.  Yeah.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Do that.  Do it.  Done.  Just like that.  Done.  Modgers starting right back to the Whalers line and over. 
[01:48:30]  Leaves it there to Mogilney.  Flips it in front of the net.  The shot.  He scores!  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Fontaine!  La, la, la, la, la, la, la.  And Buffalo takes a 2-1 lead.  God, do we have any clips?  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, Fontaine!  Do we have any clips from the last two decades, by the way?  Yeah, right?  What the hell is that?  La, la, la, la, la, Fontaine is playing golf. 
[01:49:00]  Playing golf these days.  Wow.  Sterling might be out there, Jimmy.  He might be out.  Yeah, this guy's awful.  Red Yard whips it up through center.  LaFontaine's got a breakaway.  Here's LaFontaine going right in a goal.  He's gone.  Oregon.  Oh, tis the season.  La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, LaFontaine.  Oh.  It's for the two, Buffalo.  Yeah. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, Sterling's got some competition.  And this guy.  Yeah, you know, we'll give Sterling another shot at this.  But he might be losing.  He might be losing.  I think Rick Gennaret is kicking his ass.  I don't know.  They should be.  UFC style right now.  Shannon.  Didn't shoot.  Here it is.  Cleared in front.  The score.  Miroslav Shatran.  The devil does it again.  Yes, Travi. 
[01:50:00]  Yes, Travi.  That's funny because Satan's name is spelled like Satan.  Yeah.  What did he say?  The devil does it again.  That's right.  It's pronounced Satan.  But it's not really Satan.  No, no.  He doesn't shoot a goal and then take his corkscrew phallus and make women scream.  It's so hard to get skates for those cloven hooves.  And helmet on over the horns.  How do you skate being hot all the time? 
[01:50:30]  It doesn't melt on the ice.  The ice would melt.  He's always in the penalty box for causing genocide.  Way to center ice.  Here's Laponte.  And Mogilny has got a break.  Mogilny shoots.  Rick there.  Makes the save.  He's gone.  I don't believe it.  Another hat trick.  Alexander the Great.  Oh, is he a red hot Russian.  And Apollo leaves at 6-2. 
[01:51:00]  Red hot Russian.  That's nice.  Last three or what?  You could talk there.  What's up?  The last three that I put on that CD, why they aren't bold, is they're more famous than  they are wacky or funny.  What do you mean they're more famous?  Like the May Day call when...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And...  All right.  Get it to Presley.  Gets it again.  Daw.  Charging after it.  Clear right out in front.  Backhand by Henning.  He's gone! 
[01:51:30]  Dave Hannon!  Dave Hannon is bombed by his teammates!  Dave Hannon finally put away the backhand!  And this series is going back to where Jimmy Hoffa is!  Back to the Meadowlands in New Jersey!  Hey, I like that!  That's funny.  I've never heard that call before.  Where Jimmy Hoffa is.  Good old Rick Generette.  What does he know?  Is he still the announcer up there?  Huh? 
[01:52:00]  Is he?  I don't...  Yeah.  I really don't know.  I'm not going to fake that one.  Michelle in Buffalo, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  I just want to let you know that they actually have a compilation DVD of Rick Generette.  Really?  Just...  Rick Generette.  He's that awesome and he's that beloved in Buffalo.  How long has he been up there?  Oh, forever.  Like 34 years.  I have no idea.  Wow.  Well, he might be beating out our John Sterling up there right now.  He calls the Sabres game.  He's got him hands down.  Sabre games only?  Yeah, yeah.  Was he the next hockey player?  No. 
[01:52:30]  Probably not.  Oh, Generette sounds like a hockey name.  All right, Michelle.  Thank you.  No problem.  All right.  Very cool.  ...up to LaFontaine.  He gets tripped up.  Gets it to May.  And over the line.  Here's May.  Going in on goal.  He should be...  Goal!  Mayday!  Mayday!  Mayday!  Mayday!  Mayday!  Red Bay!  Wins it in overtime!  Hey, Bird in Philly.  He writes, where does Mama hide her douches? 
[01:53:00]  Can we say that still?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Top shelf.  I need one after listening to this dope.  All right.  We got one more from Rick and Generette, and then we'll see if anyone beats him out there.  Good luck.  Travis is collecting.  We'll explain what you need to do after this.  Here's the last one.  Common Bill.  Common Bill into Ottawa territory.  Common Bill goes around Elferson, cuts him, but scores!  Jason Common Bill, short-handed. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, now do you believe.  Now do you believe.  These guys are good.  Scary good.  Scary good.  All right.  He's full energy.  I'll give him that.  Yes.  34 years.  He's the longest continuing hockey announcer out there.  Well.  How do you do that?  I don't know.  I can't watch hockey, so I can't comprehend.  It seems to be a tough game to call, though.  You can watch it physically, right?  No. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, really?  My head always turns to the left.  I don't know why.  Score!  And I'm always looking off at my grandmother's Afghans.  Okay.  You physically can't watch it.  I love watching hockey.  It seems like a very difficult game to call because, like, soccer, but hockey even seems  like it's faster moving than soccer.  Hockey does seem very hard to call, especially a lot of action by the net.  Forget about it.  You've got to know everyone's name.  This Frenchman passes to that Russian who passes to that other guy who I can't see because  he has a face mask on.  Yeah.  The puck's moving around. 
[01:54:30]  That has got to be the hardest sport to announce.  You've got some talented guys.  They do a really good job.  Yeah.  All right.  So Travis is looking for more.  And boom goes to Dynamite.  Yeah.  Travis is looking for more sports announcers from across America.  So far, we've played John Sterling here in New York.  We've got Rick Jennerette today from Buffalo.  Hopefully, we'll have Mike Lang from Pittsburgh tomorrow.  How do they get a hold of you with their sports clips there?  They can email me, and please include the audio, not just tell me where to find it, at 
[01:55:00]  Travis at FoundryMusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y Music.com.  FoundryMusic.com.  Travis.  What a sweet boy's email.  Yeah.  Aw.  Whatever you do, though, when you send in the audio, don't send pictures of male genitals.  Thanks.  Just don't do that to Travis.  He doesn't enjoy it.  It's not funny.  He doesn't want to see it.  It's not funny.  Right.  It won't make us all laugh hysterical when he opens an email and goes, aw.  Like, when he says he wants to open and see some audio or some video of the game, don't 
[01:55:30]  open it and have gay porn.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  We're telling you now, do not do that, because he doesn't like it, and it won't make us laugh  at all.  It'll just bother him and make him feel dirty and soiled.  Right.  All right.  Let's go to Rob in Jersey.  Rob, what's up?  What's up, ladies?  Hey.  Hey.  You know, you can tell with the guy from Buffalo, there's a general excitedness and happiness  in his voice, which is great, but Sterling, there's just such an air of douchiness, and  the Yankees are so much better than everybody else, you know? 
[01:56:00]  It just really gets on people's nerves.  What part of Boston are you from?  Oh, he's from Jersey.  I'm kidding.  Jersey.  Oh.  He might be a Mets fan.  Who knows?  I am a Mets fan, but I, you know.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  I hope he called it.  Shut up, stupid.  Shut up, stupid.  Gary Cohen's a douche, too, you know?  All right.  Very good.  Yeah.  It's out of here!  Yeah.  Well, that's a good call, but, I mean, the rest of you...  No, it's not.  It's an awful call.  No, that's not an awful call.  It's out of here!  Give me a...  Let's play one more Sterling Club as we go to break.  Thank you, Rob.  How about Burn, baby, Burn?  You're welcome.  It's out of here! 
[01:56:30]  All right.  And also, Kevin from Connecticut, is this true, the Pittsburgh Penguin guy?  Is that the...  Michael Lang?  Michael Lang, whatever?  He was the one that came up with...  He beat him like a rented mule?  Oh, yeah?  Is he that guy?  I want to hear some of his stuff.  He might have stole that from a comic.  Here, one more John Sterling calls.  We've got a break.  Stole it from a cowboy.  How old is that saying?  Come on.  Bill Risley warms in the bullpen.  Mattingly swings in.  He has a drive to deep right center.  It is high. 
[01:57:00]  It is far.  It is gone!  Back to back.  In a belly to belly.  John Mattingly homers in the right center of the area.  And the Yankees take up three to lead.  How old is that, Cliff?  Yeah, no kidding.  A back to back and a belly to belly.  You almost called him Dan Mattingly.  Stupid ass.  Stop being so caught up in your own call and get it right.  A Don Dan Mattingly.  A Dewan Mattingly. 
[01:57:30]  Moron.  Hey, is Michael Chiklis here?  On his way.  Okay.  Where's the thing?  Michael Chiklis.  The thing.  We're going to talk to...  The thing.  The thing is coming.  It's the thing.  This next Fantastic Four trailer looks really good, too.  Yeah.  The Silver Surrey, yeah.  It's got a bit of a buzz.  I went and saw Knocked Up last night.  Yeah.  How was it?  Was it funny?  It was all right. 
[01:58:00]  I turned to Lindsay, though.  I'm like, why can't they just make a comedy where it's just funny from beginning to end  without a serious tone to it where they have to get something done?  It's like, stop.  I just want to laugh the whole time.  A lot of morality in movies, even comedy.  All of a sudden, it's like they go into serious mode and the guy...  Whatever.  I won't give stuff away.  Like, you're going to see...  A lot of people are seeing this movie.  That's why something about Mary was loved and Borat was loved.  Because neither one of them tried to be too preachy.  They just concentrated on being funny.  There was no message in Caddyshack.  Right. 
[01:58:30]  No message.  That's the type of movies we want.  We don't want...  Like, it's funny.  It has potential.  Then they have to get something done.  Yeah.  They have to get serious and try to get you to, like, get all teary-eyed in the theater  for a little while.  Then try to wrap it up with some more funny stuff.  I was annoyed.  Because it followed the same formula as every other freaking comedy these days.  And it had potential.  It was good.  There's some good stuff in there.  But what's her name?  From Grey's Anatomy?  Maybe you guys...  Maybe I should have had this conversation with you instead of with Lindsay at dinner. 
[01:59:00]  Because she didn't really understand what I was getting at.  But it's the chick from Grey's Anatomy.  She's got huge boobs, right?  And she's in this movie.  And obviously, she has a one-night stand.  We all know that.  And she gets knocked up.  Premise of the movie.  Well, the scene where she's having the one-night stand, she's having sex with a bra on.  And I'm like, that took me out of the movie.  Yeah.  And I'm complaining about this.  She wouldn't have that on.  And I just couldn't bond with my girlfriend.  She's like, oh, you were bummed that you didn't get to see her boobs? 
[01:59:30]  No, it's just unrealistic.  Well, it took me out of the movie.  Because she has a really nice set.  And then there were a few other sex scenes.  And every sex scene she was in, she had a bra on.  Well, she must have said, yeah, no nude.  I don't do nude.  And maybe I think about this stuff too much.  But that's exactly it.  I'm like, oh, you're too good to get nude in a movie, even though you're playing kind of a slutty part.  Yeah.  So it kind of took me out.  Like, that just doesn't happen in real life.  And then I'm thinking, why wouldn't they?  All right, she doesn't want to show her boobs.  So why not film it differently where maybe she is topless, but you don't see the boobs? 
[02:00:00]  But instead, it was a bra.  It just didn't work.  Is she still the Grey's Anatomy?  A little contract dispute.  She wants a lot more money.  And now that this movie is huge, she's going to get her way.  Maybe contractually she wasn't allowed to do certain things in the movie.  I think she's just one of these actresses.  Like, look, that's beneath me.  Doesn't want to end up on celebrity skin.  Yeah, I'm not going to show my boobs in the movie.  I'll play a slut, but no.  No.  I'm going to have sex with, like, I'm going to be fully clothed, basically.  Because that's what she was. 
[02:00:30]  She had the bra on, and then everything else was covered with, you know, sheets and blankets.  But the lucky us, we got to see the fat dude's bare ass.  So there you go.  That was a nice trade-off for everybody.  Wait, what's it rated?  R.  Okay.  That's what made it weird, too.  Because, like, all right, R movie, you're playing a chick that had a one-night stand and got knocked up,  and you're wearing a bra on the sex scenes.  And I was trying to, like, explain my point of view to my girlfriend, and she's like,  what, you're bummed you didn't get to see this girl naked?  I'm like, no.  No, it's not the point.  It really wasn't the point. 
[02:01:00]  But there are things that happens in movies where it takes you out of the film, right?  Yeah.  It might be a little picky thing, but it's just something I noticed.  I felt the same thing about the Dakota Fanning movie.  There you go.  Movie's all right, but it follows the same stupid formula.  Funny, funny, funny, potential.  All right, let's get some.  Message.  Let's get the message in for whatever reason.  I don't know.  Right.  And then wrap it up nice in the end.  Hey, speaking of getting messages in.  What happened?  Oh, all right.  Well, I'm stalling because we're waiting for Michael Chiklis to come in. 
[02:01:30]  We have to break first.  All right.  Well, then point at E-Rock or something.  E-Rock.  We got to take ourselves out.  This is the program of Opie and Anthony.  And hey, we'll be, you know, whatever.  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday.  I just got wowed.  I got wowed.  I'm Sam.  I just got wowed.  Oh, thanks, guys.  Opie and Anthony.  Thank you, Opie and Anthony.  Get a wow sticker.  Get flashed.  Get happy.  Details on.  God forbid we mention a website.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:02:00]  What?  What?  What happened?  Nothing.  I was watching the Hilltop Eyes last night and James Gumm was on there.  And there's a scene in there where it's hysterical.  He wrecks his truck and his son-in-law asked him, can you fix it?  And he just looks at him like he's an idiot because the truck is towed.  And he goes, what?  It's one of the best lines ever in a movie.  I was cracking up.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Speaking of lines and movies, Kevin from Connecticut, he goes, no message in Caddyshack? 
[02:02:30]  What about Gunga da Gunga?  Ah, true.  Okay, that was the only serious moment.  All right.  Very good.  When he was talking about the Dalai Lama.  You are correct.  Yes.  By the way, coming soon to the Opie and Anthony Show.  And also coming soon to the show.  Mm-hmm.  We're trying to get a vegan chick.  Yeah.  A hot vegan chick to come in studio and we want to rub all sorts of meat products all  over her body for a good cause. 
[02:03:00]  Yep.  But we want a hardcore vegan chick that is easy on the eyes.  She should be into it because it's for a charity.  Yeah, yeah.  It should be some kind of animal charity.  Yeah, yeah.  Michael Chiklis is on his way up in the elevator.  He pays a stiff...  That'd be the turbo lift to the Enterprise because we're running out of show.  We are running out of show.  He pays a stiff price for Buzz.  Maybe we could get this in real fast.  Story of the day.  A Manhattan man is suing the maker of an energy drink that allegedly gave his manhood a most 
[02:03:30]  unwelcome boost.  Mm-hmm.  Christopher Woods, his name is Woods, was allegedly left with a painful erection.  Hey, Michael Chiklis.  All right.  A painful erection.  Yes, painful.  That's what you get to hear.  You walk in to hear erection on the radio.  What's going on?  We're in the middle of talking about this guy.  He drank one of these energy drinks, and he had an erection for three days, and his name 
[02:04:00]  is Christopher Woods, and he had to have it operated on.  He had to have a...  What is it called?  A stent?  A shunt.  A shunt.  Oh.  Put in because, yeah, it had to release and...  This is a great way to start.  Yeah.  Hi.  Welcome to the program.  Welcome.  See, we decided to go with some filler because you're a little late, and then you walk in  the middle of our filler bit.  That's all right.  But really fast.  So Woods, he drank his...  It's called Boost Plus, a protein drink that comes in... 
[02:04:30]  Whatever.  What is it?  Cialis in it?  What's that about?  You would think.  Yeah.  But it's just some kind of...  You know those energy drinks that they show people drinking on the commercials, and it's  supposed to give you some kind of energy?  I never knew it did this, but apparently it does.  Yeah.  The 29-year-old Harlem man awoke a day later with an unrelenting erection that, according  to the lawsuit filed in Manhattan Supreme Court, needed to be treated with a shunt.  Oh, my God.  You never want a shunt.  That's a fat girl with a hammer.  Hi, Michael. 
[02:05:00]  How you doing?  Good to see you.  And then they, really fast, then that didn't help the situation, so then the arteries  to his penis had to be clogged through...  Oh, all right.  Hey, hey.  Through some kind of procedure.  I'm here now.  Yeah.  To stop the flood of blood.  I'm here now.  The flow of blood.  Excuse me.  I'm here now.  Enough of this story.  You just made the stock for that company.  Yeah, I know.  Now people are going to buy it.  I don't know.  I think people are going to buy it.  Yeah, that's true.  It's a toss-up. 
[02:05:30]  Will it go up?  Yeah, Michael, you're not going to remember.  You're having an unbelievable career, and you're not going to remember this, but I got  to say, Anthony and I were first starting out in radio.  We were out in L.A. at the Comedy Store.  We worked together officially like a week, and we were really new to this business, and  we interviewed you at the Comedy Store, and you were beyond cool to us.  That was a lot.  And I never forgot it, because there were a lot of guys that were douches that day, because  they realized we were very green and new to this, but you were really, really cool,  and I never forgot. 
[02:06:00]  It was around the Oscars.  I'm glad to hear it.  And I know you don't remember us, and that's fine.  You've probably done a million interviews, but it has to be said.  I remember that day, but it was a cluster.  Yeah.  We went from sort of...  Didn't we go from...  Station to station to station.  Station to station to station.  That's right.  See, we're lucky we don't have to do those anymore.  There you go.  Good, man.  I'm glad to see you guys are kicking ass.  Finally making it.  I love it.  Did you ever, when you were a kid, you probably were reading Fantastic Four and that type of stuff,  right?  Like, I mean, everyone knew it. 
[02:06:30]  Did you ever look at this thing and go, yeah, I'll be him someday?  No.  No, but I...  You didn't even read the comic book.  No, I absolutely did.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, I was the one out of the four of us that was actually a fan.  I mean, I'm old enough to, you know.  I was, you know, up 10, 11, 12, 13 years old, I was a fan of the comic, and then I got  interested in girls and, you know, it got put in its proper place, you know.  Comic books go out the window.  No, but I got to tell you what, man. 
[02:07:00]  You know, you wouldn't...  Have you ever been to Comic-Con or any of these things?  Oh, we have a guy that we send, yeah, this guy.  He's hardcore.  Wow.  He comes back with some great video footage and stuff.  Who knew?  I never knew.  It was the most eye-opening experience.  I got out of the, you know, the limo and there's 12 Imperial Stormtroopers.  Yeah.  And I mean, so good.  The costumes they put together, they could have been in the flick. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  Like, wow.  And a guy, he had to be 40-something years old, dressed as the thing of his own fruition.  I mean, like, he did it to himself, you know, which I would never do.  Yeah, you were getting paid for it, and I heard it was quite the process.  And it was hellish, you know.  Yeah.  It's always, you know, the costume's never going to be easy.  It's never going to be...  Although, I'll tell you what, it was 100 times easier this time, the second time, than  it was the other time.  Oh, they figured it out a little bit better?  Yeah, absolutely.  It was...  First time, it's just like, hey, let's throw this stuff on you, and it weighs 100 pounds. 
[02:08:00]  It was 60, 65 pounds of latex.  Once they glued me into it, I was in for 12, 12 and a half hours.  How many hours is that egg in there?  Is it claustrophobic?  Yeah, and I'm not a claustrophobe, but the problem is when you glue 60 pounds of latex on  your body, there's nowhere for the heat to go.  So, it's just, your body temperature rises exponentially, and you, you know, and sitting  in your own sweat for 12 hours.  I don't want to talk about this anymore, because people are going to think of me and go, ooh. 
[02:08:30]  Wait, how long a day to get into it and out of it?  Like, Michael Jackson, I think, when he said it took like six hours a day to do his makeup,  but he was doing that whatever stupid video that was.  Thriller?  Yeah, yeah, with the...  How long...  Nice current reference.  I'm trying to think of somebody who heard of the makeup chair.  No one's put on any makeup.  No one's put on makeup since Thriller and Light.  All right, Diane Sawyer, to look like she's under 75.  Yeah, there you go.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  The first one, it just took about three and a half hours to put my face and head on alone. 
[02:09:00]  So, it was an arduous task.  What do you do as they're doing that?  What do you just...  Try to sleep.  Well, actually, you know, the first one, it was the Boston Red Sox that got me through it  because it was 0-4.  And it was during the playoffs.  I don't remember that.  What happened?  I don't know.  I blacked out too.  I don't remember that at all.  3-0, lose 4-3.  Yeah, you guys did black out.  We blacked out and apparently so did the Yankees. 
[02:09:30]  What do you do?  This is a childish question, but of course, like 60 pounds of latex.  All right, it's all on.  All right, you're finally in and all of a sudden you've got to go to the bathroom.  I mean, is there an allowment for that or are you just kind of screwed for the rest of the day?  I was screwed for the rest of the day.  And what I had to do was I had to, you know, a lot of penis talk this morning.  I mean, the guy with the erection and now me with voiding myself before work.  You know, you just had to, you know, void.  Snip a little hole in the big toe of the suit and just let it run out. 
[02:10:00]  No, well, the other thing, the interesting thing is, you know, when you go jogging, you  don't ever feel the need to go to the bathroom because you're sweating.  Right.  It was kind of like that where all my body water was going out of my body.  You know, I was sweating so much that I didn't need to pee in the course of the day.  And that was unhealthful, too, because, you know, 12 hours a day, you're supposed to  flush certain. 
[02:10:30]  Did you lose a lot of weight?  No, everybody's just going to be like, yeah.  Yeah, I'm going to watch the movie.  They're going to look at me and they're going to shake their head.  I bet he's sweating in that suit.  This is good.  This is just as hot as talking to Jessica Alba.  I mean.  I would ask her the same question.  No, but this is why we suck, man.  Jessica, do you get sweaty?  And we love you, Michael.  We are big fans of you.  But I see Jessica Alba doing interviews for this movie all everywhere except our show.  Well. 
[02:11:00]  They're keeping her away from our show.  There's a reason because you go with that story about the guy when Michael's sitting  down.  Yeah.  I walk in and I hear him.  Well, actually, one of our guys was told to take his arm off Jessica Alba.  So last time we ran into you guys.  Poe put his sweaty armpit, one of the security guys, his sweaty armpit on her shoulder.  And we were just like, oh, my God.  And they were like.  And she was like, what are you, the thing?  Yeah.  What are you wearing, a suit?  What is that, late things?  We spoke to you when I guess the commish was on. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  And yeah, a while ago.  A few years ago.  That was the last time we talked.  But I brought up.  I remember that.  And I brought up the fact that after you did the Belushi movie, so many people were saying,  boy, this guy's career in Hollywood is over.  He's done.  And I wonder how that's got to feel for you to be able to kind of, you know, even if  you're a humble guy to go, hey, up yours.  Look what look.  Look what's going on.  Yeah.  Then you had, you know, The Shield, which was just it's a hugely popular show. 
[02:12:00]  Broke a lot of ground with that show, too.  Yeah.  And, you know, it's kind of like it must be nice.  Quietly, peacefully in the hours at home by myself and my wife.  It's vindicating.  Yeah.  It's a question.  It's it was a scary time, you know, to be sure three and do your first movie and have  people go.  That's it.  You're done in this town.  You'll never work again.  What?  Michael Chiklis does not get that picture.  I'm sure it went just like that. 
[02:12:30]  No, you know, listen, I'm glad that my instinct back then wasn't to fight anybody.  It wasn't, you know, wasn't to, you know, lash back or, you know, because I knew I couldn't  win.  I, you know, I didn't come from means, any money or anything, you know, so I didn't have  any.  And you're offered a part like that, especially so young and new in the business.  You know, it seems like, God, I really want to take this.  I want the work.  You know, I want to get my name out there.  Yeah.  And I think ultimately that's one of the things that saved me is that, you know, at first 
[02:13:00]  there was misplaced aggression.  And then, you know, as people, you know, as time went on, people got over it, moved on  and, you know what, he was just a kid at the time, you know, telling people what the specials  were that evening.  You know, what was he going to do?  Say, no, I'm not.  No, I'm not going to do it.  No, damn it.  I'm not taking that.  Yeah.  Major movie.  I want to be an actor.  I'm not going to do an independent film.  Yeah, exactly.  In Turkey.  They got it. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, exactly.  That's good.  And then there's, I hate jumping around here, but we're running out of time.  Damn it.  The Shield was, that was pretty much the first show that really broke that boundary on  even a cable channel where you tuned in and watched and people were like, what the hell  did he just say?  And you're like going, wait a minute, what did I just hear?  Hey, listen, man.  Were you surprised when you read the scripts and said, is this going on television?  Well, my biggest thing with doing it was, you know, the first thing I said was, first  of all, what is FX? 
[02:14:00]  You know, I didn't know who they were, never heard of them.  So I was knocked out by the script.  It was the best pilot I had ever read.  And I said to them, guys, you know, are we going to make this, this script?  Really?  Really?  Really?  Because, you know, I don't want to come on to set the first day and get the pink pages  and it's like watered down and everything is out of here.  If you sterilize it, it'll kill this thing.  That was a good take.  Now let's do this one for safety.  Yeah.  And it's just.  You have been on sets. 
[02:14:30]  Well, I've heard from Jimmy and what they say, do it for safety.  That's the one they're using.  No, no.  Yeah, this sucks.  Yeah.  And they're taking the good one, throwing it out and using the sucky, wussy down one.  You mean ruin it.  Right.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I'll give you a brutal one for safety.  So you have to use one.  Right.  So that's great that they.  In any case, you know, they, Peter Liguori and Kevin Reilly at the time were the presidents  of FX and they were incredibly courageous.  They said, no, man.  Absolutely.  They didn't cut a word. 
[02:15:00]  Nothing.  It was unbelievable.  It got heads turning.  I think that's what like kicked it off where shows like Rescue Me and other shows really  started picking up and saying, hey, if this show can be successful like this, you know,  we can get more of a realism and grit into a show.  Well, their whole thing was, look, there's a void between premium cable and network television  and basic cable.  And we want to basically go for the HBO of basic cable, the poor man's HBO, if you will. 
[02:15:30]  But we want to be as good as them.  We want to put out stuff that's eye to eye with them.  Can we do that?  And it was sort of left to us to try to do that.  And we feel really good about the result.  Yeah.  It's just more realism.  People in that situation, they would talk like that.  You know, that's how the language would go.  I hate when you watch a show on network television.  You're like, oh, God.  Hey, imagine acting in it when you kind of, you know, and you have to say dirt bag. 
[02:16:00]  You know, you're like, what?  They're going to cut us off.  Fantastic Four, we've got to get the plug in.  June 15th at a theater near you.  Let me tell you what.  Yeah, what can we expect from the next one?  Fantastic Four, you know, listen, if you're a fan of the Fantastic Four, you're going to  love this because we've got the Silver Surfer now.  These guys from Weta did the special effects.  It's huge.  It really is a big.  It's the Lord of the Rings guys.  Yeah, incredible visual effects.  It really is stunning.  You do end up going, wow, out loud. 
[02:16:30]  You're going to see a big difference from the first one as far as the special effects  go?  Yes, absolutely, because that was handled by four different special effects houses, and  that gets kind of confusing.  You know, and I mean, these guys brought it all into one roof, and they were incredible.  The trailer looks amazing.  I don't even see that many, like, comic book movies, and this is what I want to see, because  the trailer looks great.  Yeah, you went, wow, right?  Did you spend time in that?  I was whacking those missiles out of the way.  Did you spend time in New Zealand?  No, no.  When they did that?  No, not at all. 
[02:17:00]  They came to us, and we shot this up in Vancouver, Canada again.  Yeah.  But, you know, and we have Jessica Alba.  Yeah.  Just tell everyone that she's totally nude in the new movie.  Just why?  Just who cares?  Well, she is, actually.  Yeah, yeah.  See, at one point.  There you go.  But, you know, what you see may vary.  We wish you got here earlier, man.  We're pretty fans, but they're going to shut us off here.  So, Fantastic Four, June 15th.  Yeah. 
[02:17:30]  And another season of The Shield?  We're just about to start shooting it June 18th.  How many seasons is that for The Shield?  Seven.  Wow, wow.  Four and a half.  Oh, I've lost 12 years on television.  God, that failed career of yours.  My God.  Blockbuster movie.  Thanks, guys.  Great.  Michael Chick.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right, we're out of here.  They're going to cut us off.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. </pre>
