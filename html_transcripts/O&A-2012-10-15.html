<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, starting with a discussion of Felix Baumgartner's Red Bull Stratos jump.  The hosts debated the differing broadcast coverage, focusing on the jump's speed, height, and Baumgartner's experience, including his spin during the fall. A caller explained terminal velocity and drogue chutes.  This transitioned into a discussion of a viral video depicting a Cleveland bus driver uppercutting a female passenger. The hosts described the video, speculated on the passenger's behavior, and reacted to the driver's subsequent suspension, using offensive language and stereotypes in their commentary.  Several callers contributed to the discussion, providing details about the passenger and the incident. The hosts also referenced Scott Shannon, David Blaine, and SNL personnel.

The show continued with a multi-faceted discussion.  It included a detailed examination of the Cleveland bus driver assault incident involving Melissa Reed and the driver's potential termination. This was followed by extensive commentary on the 2012 Presidential debates between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, including jokes about Paul Ryan's resemblance to the *Nevermind* baby. The hosts then shifted to criticizing the New York Yankees' playoff performance, specifically targeting Alex Rodriguez and Robinson Cano, along with a controversial umpire call, using highly offensive language to describe A-Rod.  They also discussed the low Yankee Stadium attendance. A $2,000 jingle contest sponsored by Steven Singer Jewelers was announced, with the playing of several past submissions and further offensive humor.  Personal anecdotes followed, including Opie's story about cutting his wife's swollen fingers to remove rings and E-Rock's Comic-Con experiences moderating a Christopher Lloyd panel. A brief, vulgar discussion about Tim Tebow's virginity was also included.

A segment called "Jacktober," celebrating "shitty" radio moments, highlighted the hosts' upcoming stand-up shows in Toronto and Dallas, and included a discussion on the location of Searchlight/Primm, Nevada.  Comedian Roland's Comic-Con experiences, involving harassment of costumed attendees, were discussed at length. This led into a critique of *Dish Nation*, featuring clips from various radio shows including Scott and Todd, Blaine and Allison, the Ricky Smiley Show, and Kid Craddock.  The clips and subsequent commentary were laced with crude humor, referencing incidents such as Kathy Lee Gifford dropping a puppy.  The hosts also commented on several other media personalities, including Kathy Lee Gifford, Chris Brown, Rihanna, and Madonna, using vulgar language and offensive jokes.

Henry Winkler then appeared as a guest in-studio.  The conversation covered Winkler's career, including his decision to turn down the role of Danny in *Grease*, his dyslexia diagnosis at 31, his collaborative writing process with Lynn Oliver, and anecdotes about encounters with other actors, some involving perceived disrespect. He discussed his roles in *Here Comes the Boom* and *The Performers*, mentioning Alicia Silverstone and his sons' careers. The conversation also touched upon Erin Moran's struggles, his relationship with Ron Howard, and his post-*Happy Days* career choices.  The final portion with Winkler included off-topic discussions about his favorite place, working habits, *Absolute Strangers*, further promotion of *Here Comes the Boom*, a listener's request to see *The Performers*, and comedic bits from a past Opie and Anthony CD.  Further off-topic banter included a discussion of Bruno Mars and a bathroom anecdote.

The final excerpt included a discussion of a listener's viral video explaining "illegal means not legal," a 14-year-old girl shot by the Taliban, and a subway advertisement on jihad.  A significant portion focused on an evasive intern, Troy, with humorous frustration and insults from the hosts.  This led to discussions about Jim Norton's celebrity photo habits, alleged SNL joke theft, and the hosts' Comic-Con experiences, including anecdotes about sleeping during panels, the high cost of convention food and drink, and autograph acquisition.  Henry Winkler's potential violent temper and the intern's perceived awkwardness were also discussed at length.  The show concluded with further discussions of Comic-Con and future broadcast plans.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Monday morning!  Good morning.  Do it again.  Do it again. And again. And again.  Remember that week? Remember that week you did?  Do it again!  Start over!  Do over!  Yeah!  Yeah, but we had a lot of cool stuff happen over the weekend.  Absolutely.  It makes doing radio easy.  Certainly those.  You got your Yankees falling apart.  Yep. 
[00:00:30]  You got the spaceman.  The spaceman.  What else do we have?  I didn't see the jump.  Oh, Jimmy.  Everyone was thinking of you and how you'd have sweaty palms.  I know. I watched part of it on another tape.  But if they show it from a distance, you see a little dot falling.  Yeah, no. You gotta see him step on.  No, no. This is what happened.  Someone tweeted and said, hey, the spaceman's doing his jump.  That's why I like the Twitter.  I go, well, thank you, Mr. Twitterer.  And I clicked the link and it was the YouTube link, which was completely live. 
[00:01:00]  And then I'm like, why watch it on my little laptop when I got this nice fucking huge TV in front of me?  Sure.  So I go, you know what?  I bet you CNN has the spaceman jumping.  So I put on CNN and they have the whole thing happen, right?  Cool.  And then all of a sudden, the broad goes, well, he's jumped and we will go back to the live coverage when he lands.  What?  They didn't show the jump.  So then you had to listen to that Chad guy, the weather guy with his nonsense. 
[00:01:30]  Chad!  Chad!  Wow.  My thing is, what the fuck was CNN thinking?  YouTube had something like 350 million views to this live event.  And then someone told me, a bunch of people told me that the Discovery Channel also showed it live.  Yeah.  With maybe a slight delay.  But CNN actually cut away.  They didn't even show him a step off the platform.  They didn't even show that.  How ridiculous.  All of a sudden, it was something like the doors opened and you saw him scooting out. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  And next thing you know, they're like, okay.  And they cut back to the studio.  They didn't even show him jump.  They're CNN.  They didn't do that.  This is a huge news event.  Do you think they're not allowed to?  I wonder if these people only licensed it to YouTube and somebody else.  I don't know if it's news, though.  News, yeah.  That's kind of weird.  If it's news, I think you're allowed to.  I think so.  Even if they sold the rights, let's say, to Discovery or something as a news organization,  I think you could say, well, fuck that. 
[00:02:30]  We're showing this.  Yeah, I don't know what the law is.  I don't know.  Because it was definitely on YouTube and it was definitely on the Discovery Channel Live.  And CNN cuts away.  I'm like, then why did you just waste two hours on this, you dummies?  They show the capsule or whatever it's called up there with the helium balloon.  I saw some of that.  I went back and watched a little bit of video.  When he steps off that platform.  Oh, my.  Yeah.  And he's just looking at the whole, he could see the whole fucking, like, Earth. 
[00:03:00]  The whole Earth.  It's, it's.  How do you, how do you, how do you see the whole Earth?  And then you just got to have faith that you're not going to miss it.  Like, like, that you're not just going to veer off to the side and be like, oh, shit.  I fucking, I'm missing the planet.  Oh, fuck.  That's got to go through your head.  Yeah.  I don't care how much training you've had.  Yeah.  You step off that thing and think, oh, boy, I'm going to miss Earth.  Could you make it big, Sam?  And why did he, what, my thing is he opened his parachute at 5,000 feet.  I'm like, why did he fall until 5,000?  No.  He opened it well before 5,000. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, they said 5,000 feet.  Oh, man.  No.  He was still a, like a lot of things.  Just 128,000 feet.  Um, I thought he opened a lot sooner than that.  I believe so, too.  Because he was going over 800 miles an hour at one point.  834 miles an hour?  Yeah.  Something like that.  And then he slowed down.  So this is what CNN showed.  This part where he scoots out.  They didn't even show him standing up.  Oh, that's crazy.  Thank God I kept my laptop on.  Start the cameras.  You can see the whole planet.  Yeah. 
[00:04:00]  Holy fuck.  I was telling these guys, you know how hard it is to step off a high diving board when you're a kid?  Yeah.  Can you imagine what goes through your head before you step off this thing?  Now you're just stepping off into nothingness.  Oh, man.  Dude, you saw the whole earth.  Yeah.  All right, I know.  The whole earth is working, you know.  You got it one day.  Sounds like Scott Shannon.  All right, you see.  There's a tree on my planet.  That's really high. 
[00:04:30]  What is he saying?  That's really high.  Yeah, no shit.  There's no Neil Armstrong with the quotes.  No.  Really high.  Oh, jeez.  I'm going over.  And then he jumps.  And just jumps.  And you realize how fast he is falling.  Because he just disappears in, like, no time.  And boom, he's already gone.  Wow, is he falling fast?  Yeah.  See, I didn't like this view, though, because, like, I want to see his helmet cam.  They got a helmet cam view now.  Of course they do.  Yeah, we watched some helmet cam this morning.  It's out there if you want to search it out. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, yeah, I want to see that.  As a matter of fact, we'll put it on our Facebook page, right, E-Rock?  All right.  Yeah, because then all of a sudden he starts spinning out of control.  Oh, did he?  Oh, my God, yeah.  But he figured that shit out.  I think they were worried about that.  He stabilized.  Yeah, he was spinning like crazy.  Was that when he, that's his head head cam?  Well, the spinning thing, two things, he's not going to, you know, break the sound barrier.  And, you know, I think he could get hurt, too.  Don't you think, spinning like that? 
[00:05:30]  Sure.  How did he straighten out, though?  Because I know that.  It's just a technique skydivers use.  Kittenger jumped.  They were worried about that, too.  When you watch the old footage, Kittenger jumping.  But you could see him falling longer, I guess because it was a cloudy day.  So you could see him falling into the clouds.  You don't realize how fucking fast he was going.  But this guy, wow.  It's unbelievable.  Pretty impressive, man.  And then he just lands very lightly.  Oh, like, tunk, tunk, tunk, tunk, tunk.  Just steps back onto the Earth. 
[00:06:00]  Is it?  That's the helmet cam.  Look at the whole planet's right there in front of him.  That's him falling, right?  Not yet.  Not yet, I think it is.  You sure?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he's got to be falling at that point.  He already started falling.  Because the Earth is sort of spinning around a little bit, right?  So what are we looking at now?  The helmet cam.  That's actually a view from his chest up to his helmet.  Oh.  Yeah.  Wait, so is he backwards right now?  He's falling head first. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, but is he...  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Now he's spinning.  Yeah, okay, I got you.  Oh, and I fucking vomit into my helmet.  Just get that horrible feeling in your gut for how long?  Almost five minutes, right?  It's four minutes, 17 seconds, I want to say.  Oh, my God.  Four minutes and 17 seconds, and he fell.  And I think the record's 436.  I think he missed that.  Oh, that's why he opened low.  I see.  Yeah, he was trying to open as low as possible to set the record, but...  Okay.  That would just be... 
[00:07:00]  He's trying to straighten out.  He's putting his, like, legs and arms around and trying to just straighten himself out.  Which he does.  And then everyone started cheering when he figured that out, when he stopped spinning.  Before or after the sound barrier break right now?  Huh?  Oh, there you go.  Did he break the sound barrier yet or no?  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know when that officially happened.  How far into the jump that he broke the sound barrier?  I'm not sure.  I imagine it was fast because it's the thin air. 
[00:07:30]  That's why they wanted to do it so high.  It still took about a minute or two, I would assume, to get to that speed.  Jeepers.  And Sean in Jersey saying what everyone's thinking today, biggest set of balls ever.  Yeah, I think so.  I think it's way the fuck up there.  What happens to the capsule he was in?  Is that a land?  I think they landed it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Where's a fucking, like, just fall and then a parachute comes out or some shit?  I think they just let some of the air out and then it just came back down.  Let some of the air out.  You hear how thin the fucking balloon was?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:08:00]  A tenth of a sandwich bag.  It's like a fucking scrotum.  How the fuck did they not put a hole in that thing?  I know.  A tenth of a sandwich bag.  Yeah, that's crazy.  You see how big it was?  It was 600 feet, right?  It's huge.  They showed a little scale thing next to the Statue of Liberty, how big it would be.  And it just fucking...  It dwarfed the Statue of Liberty?  Well, it's a little taller than the Statue of Liberty.  Oh, okay.  And then as far as wide, though, because it gets bigger as it goes up because the pressure  is less upright.  And it just fucking inflates into this giant fucking globe. 
[00:08:30]  Wow.  Why was it so thin?  Oh, man.  I guess they...  Weight?  I don't know.  I guess they just needed to...  Wow, you see him falling?  He is really...  Tumbling.  Yeah, he was just tumbling for a while.  Well, you don't get that feeling in your gut when you jump out of a plane or capsule.  Why not?  Let's see if Rich knows.  Rich?  You know, I went skydiving once before.  I know it's not really the same thing.  But that weird, like, roller coaster feeling, you get in your... 
[00:09:00]  I mean, you don't get that when you go skydiving.  Why is that?  I was worried about that, but you don't get that.  Thank God you didn't, because that would have been a long drop.  All right, you say that, but why don't you get that?  I've already got a, this guy is full of shit.  Yeah, we like learning.  You got to get that feeling.  No, you don't.  I was afraid I was going to do it.  I went up in the plane, and then as soon as I jumped out, nothing.  It was just, you just get this, I don't know, you just fall.  You don't get that, like, you know, your stomach's coming up into your chest every time you go down a roller coaster. 
[00:09:30]  I don't know.  What do you think?  I don't think so.  I don't know.  I think you just had a good day, Rich.  I still get it every time I go on a roller coaster, but...  So you get the feeling on a roller coaster, but you don't get it when you skydive?  Come on.  I'm sure somebody else is going to call in and tell you the same thing.  All right.  All right.  We'll wait for that call, sir.  Mr. Shore.  Thank you, Rich.  All right.  How'd your Eagles do, man?  I noticed no one really watches football. 
[00:10:00]  That's the story radio show.  Oh, he might have hung up.  That's his oxygen supply?  Yeah, the Eagles lost an OT.  I guess he didn't have much oxygen.  What the fuck?  No, he had over six minutes.  Yeah.  That's plenty.  Yeah, yeah.  Because the oxygen started when he, you know, stepped out.  And they knew he was only going to, like, free fall for, what, four and a half?  Yeah.  At most.  Who's the guy in Mission Control that looks like the old man from Pawn Stars?  Yeah.  He seemed a little old to be the main guy. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, huh?  Too much stress.  You don't want the main guy being a bit old.  No.  What about that?  What else about this thing?  What did it accomplish?  Besides being really cool.  No idea.  The one thing I heard is something about NASA looking into new spacesuit technology.  Right.  And then, yeah.  Oh, that's good.  Consider we don't have a space program anymore.  Yeah, exactly.  What do you need a spacesuit for?  Right.  I don't know what else.  It's just one of those things that, this is kind of a thing that people did, like, in the 70s. 
[00:11:00]  Right.  Like, you'd be like, oh, look at that.  He's a daredevil doing something.  Nowadays, how many daredevils?  Yeah.  I couldn't help myself.  I had to tweet David Blaine.  I said, hey, do you feel kind of silly about your stunt?  Come on.  I go, you must feel really silly about your dumb stunt after seeing the spaceman jump.  Yeah.  Mr. Electrocution.  Please.  He has the worst timing.  Why would you do your silly stunt knowing this is right around the corner?  Yeah. 
[00:11:30]  This guy's going to jump from space, and you're going to do a bit that every morning zoo show is done in America.  Yeah, this guy didn't have to be carried away.  No, of course not.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh.  He stepped right back on the planet.  Yeah, he did.  He probably just banged broads all day.  That's a man's man.  Exactly.  The reason he didn't feel it is because he probably took tandem jump.  What would be the difference?  Oh, the other guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Let me see.  Let's go to Mike in Jersey. 
[00:12:00]  Mike.  Hey, what's going on?  The reason that you feel that feeling in your stomach is because you're accelerating.  Like when you go on a roller coaster.  When you jump out of a plane, you eventually reach something called terminal velocity.  That's where the force of gravity pulling down is equal to the force, the wind resistance pushing you back up, and you stop accelerating.  That's why you don't feel that feeling in your stomach.  Why wouldn't you feel it the second you jump out?  You would, but he probably did a tandem jump, which means as soon as he jumps out, the other guy throws up a drogue chute, 
[00:12:30]  and it's the experienced skydiver who's actually doing all the work.  He puts up a drogue chute, so you hit terminal velocity really, really fast.  What about the point between you jumping out and him throwing the drogue chute?  Yeah, it's probably a couple seconds.  He said no, he didn't get it, though.  Not even a couple of seconds.  He said he didn't get it at all.  What's a drogue chute?  It's a chute with a drogue.  Oh, I wasn't sure.  I thought it was a film.  It drogues you down. 
[00:13:00]  Sir, what's a drogue chute?  It's a small parachute that comes out right away that just helps to stabilize you.  Oh, okay.  So you don't spin out of control?  Yeah.  Gotcha.  Well, thank you there, Mike.  Can you still follow the drogue chute?  Oh, yeah.  It's much too small to slow you down.  People are hanging out quick today.  Yeah, really.  The mission control guy was Joe Kittinger?  Oh, okay.  That old guy was Joe Kittinger.  Everyone's saying that.  You know what?  I watched the whole thing and I didn't even know. 
[00:13:30]  Gee.  Yeah.  I think Joe was trying to guide him wrong.  All right, go ahead.  Just jump.  He's like, no, no, wait.  My thing's not plugged in yet.  Take your suit off.  Yeah, kick the controls.  It's good luck.  Pop the balloon.  That's kind of cool that Joe was part of the whole thing.  He was the guy that did it last time, back in 1960, I want to say.  In 1960.  Yeah.  Yeah, some technology has changed since then.  And his glove wasn't working on the way up. 
[00:14:00]  Right.  His glove started to depressurize, he said, in one of his hands.  It was freezing.  Wow, that's fucked up.  Yeah.  Four times higher than Everest.  That's how high it was?  That's crazy.  Know what they should do.  They should make that a ride.  Not the jumping part, but just going up there.  Oh, shit.  Can you imagine going in that capsule?  That'd be crazy.  And then they do open the door, but you're strapped in nice,  and you get to take a look at the Earth from that?  How much would you pay to do that if you had the money?  Nothing.  They'd have to pay me.  You wouldn't do it? 
[00:14:30]  To sit in a space suit and look at Earth?  But you don't have to jump.  Then they bring you back down somehow.  That sounds very dangerous.  How cool would that be?  Space rides are costing $200,000 a seat to go into, like,  when Branson launches that plane that can actually take passengers into space.  It's only, like, a 12-minute ride, I think, but it's $200,000.  And supposedly, they were saying during the coverage yesterday,  that that is happening sooner than later.  We are going to see space travel. 
[00:15:00]  Like, yeah, where it's commercial.  Not to actually get places, just to, you know, check it out.  Eventually.  Yeah.  Would you do that?  Go up into the plane that goes into space?  That'd be a bit creepy.  I'd be so scared.  I would be scared.  What if the wing flies off and you're in space?  I'm scared when we drive, fly to Cleveland.  I think I'd be scared of that.  Fucking Red Bull really getting their money's worth.  Oh, and how much they spent on this, though.  Amazing.  It was $25,000. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, I thought more.  See, that's a pretty big, that's a good deal.  Cheap.  Ditch Banger.  Morning, boys.  Good morning, Ditch.  I 100% agree with that first caller.  I'm no scientist by no means, but I have fallen off a stepladder,  and I did not feel anything like that.  He fell off a stepladder.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  And he didn't feel that.  Thank you.  So you gotta...  Really?  I'm going with him.  I'm going to get into something in a minute or two. 
[00:16:00]  Is that about it for the spaceman?  I reckon.  What's his name?  Felix Baumgorton?  Yeah.  Something like that.  He's a fucking...  I don't know what he is.  Is he a hero?  What is he?  I guess he's a daredevil.  Yeah, he's a real daredevil.  Right.  I'm not like this dumb David Blaine.  David Blaine.  Fucking David Blaine.  What an idiot.  Oh, God.  You have the worst publicist ever.  Yeah.  Why would you schedule your silly fucking stunt the same week that this guy's doing this? 
[00:16:30]  Electricity.  Look at me.  Yeah.  Where all he had to do every once in a while was dramatically move his hands.  Yeah.  So the electricity looks a little wild.  If I scratch my nose, though...  Right.  I don't have this helmet on.  Look out.  This guy's in fucking space.  This guy had, I think, 972 checks before he could even fucking step off that thing.  The best part, it was so dramatic, is when they said something like when the air equalizes 
[00:17:00]  in the capsule or whatever.  Yeah.  Is that what I'm...  Yeah.  Something like that?  Yeah.  They depressurized the capsule so they could open the door.  Kittenger goes, when that happens, the door will open automatically.  And man, they showed that door opening automatically.  That was like, wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you see all this?  No.  Oh, you didn't see the lead up?  No.  I was snoozing.  Can we see the door open, Sam?  That's pretty cool.  The lead up is really cool to the whole thing.  And then there's a camera where, you know, his point of view where now you just see the  door open.  And then it's like, okay, scoot forward.  I think he actually even said scoot. 
[00:17:30]  Scoot forward.  Or move forward or whatever.  And then he didn't move forward enough and he goes, no, a little more.  Oh, my God.  Fuck you.  Yeah, exactly.  Fuck you.  Yeah, it was cool.  It took me away from the Jets, but the Jets had an easy game yesterday.  Did they?  Did they win?  Oh, yeah.  They beat the Colts.  The Colts aren't the greatest team this year, that's for sure.  Oh, man.  I want to see that door open.  How did the Cowboys do, Jimmy?  I found out last night they lost, but who cares?  Who gives a shit, right? 
[00:18:00]  Rubble's a bum.  Who gives a turkey?  Yeah, I could care less.  No.  I don't give a care.  Yeah.  I was at Collins last night.  Yeah.  After the cellar, I drove to his place.  And I bought some low-fat vanilla yogurt, and he bought fucking six Diet Cokes.  I should have taken a picture of it.  Six Diet Cokes?  All he has in his refrigerator is six caffeine-free Diet Cokes.  It's fucking empty.  Really?  Except for that.  It's empty.  It's the worst refrigerator ever.  He just goes out.  He eats outside of his house.  Why wouldn't you have just a few things in your refrigerator? 
[00:18:30]  I know why he doesn't.  Even when I was single and just a fucking loser, I had something in there.  Well, he's an ass.  That's why he doesn't.  And we just sat in his apartment for a little while and watched fucking Goodfellas clips.  Of course.  And we watched the fucking scene, Alfred Molina scene from Boogie Nights.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  The whole scene.  All week, I just go, motoring.  He wants something else from you.  Yeah.  What? 
[00:19:00]  What?  What?  He's ready to be very accommodating.  He just wants you to hang out and party with him.  Right.  Oh, wow.  There's the balloon.  Yeah, that's how big it would be.  Holy shit.  That's huge.  Yeah.  That don't make no sense.  Oh.  It makes sense.  You want to get into that in a minute?  Ugh.  I don't know.  This guy goes, what if the guy would have bailed and said he didn't want to do it?  I think when you get up on the diving board and say no.  Yeah, I think he had no choice at that point.  Well, he did a test site, a test jump at like 90,000 feet.  Oh, of course he. 
[00:19:30]  I know.  What?  He did 90,000 without anyone looking?  It was a test, yeah.  But there's no footage of that, really.  He just went out there by himself and said, oh, I'm going to do 90,000.  Is there?  Yeah, but it's not like from that distance you can't tell.  But don't you think 90,000, 120,000 is pretty much the same shit?  Sure.  Just a little longer?  Yeah, you wouldn't hurt yourself anymore jumping in the top one.  How many?  And airliners go, what, 35,000 feet?  Yeah.  So this was 35, then you've got to go 70, then you've got to go 105, and then you've got to... 
[00:20:00]  Wow.  Pretty goddamn high.  Wow.  Three times the airliners, about.  Yeah, about that at least, yeah.  Maybe closer to three and a half-ish.  And I think, what would the Concorde do to go, like 60,000, 70,000 feet?  That was much higher to break...  Concorde did?  Yeah, that flew very high.  Might have been 50.  Wow.  That was a much higher...  That guy blows everything away.  Jeepers.  Yeah.  That's fucking scary shit.  I would hate to look out and just... 
[00:20:30]  Oh, God.  And you know there's a wafer-thin balloon holding you up?  Yeah, wafer-thin.  A tenth of a sandwich bag.  God.  How the hell do you ship that?  Yeah, what do you...  What's that?  What do you do if it pops on the way up?  Fall.  Like, because now you're in the capsule, and it's falling.  It can't be that easy to get the fuck out right away.  True.  You gotta...  I guess you've got to count on your equipment.  And hope, what, a parachute deploys on the capsule?  Yeah, over 5,000 feet, the parachute would work on the capsule. 
[00:21:00]  Oh.  But what if you're at the, you know, 50,000 feet?  That would work.  But I think under 5,000...  If you're at 10 feet...  I think what happens is you have to actually hang and drop.  If you're at 102 feet, you fall.  3,000 feet, you fall.  Oh, man.  What if he hit a bird?  You know what?  I don't know.  That's a fucking good question.  What if a bird hit that fucking wafer-thin?  Dude, what if a bird hit him on the way down at fucking the speed of sound?  That's what I'm saying. 
[00:21:30]  He'd be dead.  That thing would go through him like a cannonball.  What if he hit one of Anthony's helicopters?  Yes.  You could see my fucking drone right next to his capsule before he jumps.  Oh, my God.  And then it zips away because you're like, oops.  A little too close to the capsule.  All weekend, I've been hooking up my ground telemetry transmitter and my video downlink.  So now I will know exactly where it is, and I will have video as it's flying.  So I won't lose it again like that. 
[00:22:00]  Nice.  What if a bird hit him?  What if a fucking bird hit him?  He would be so dead.  There isn't even a chance he would live through that.  You sure?  Or his balloon.  It wouldn't just smush off his space suit?  Dude, at that speed, more than the speed of sound, hitting a fucking bird, it would rip right there.  But birds are kind of soft.  Oh, boy.  Wouldn't you go just through it?  I bet at that speed, a bird is like fucking a diamond.  It's just a giant flying diamond.  You see the United Airlines footage or whatever of the bird to hit the front and put a giant hole in the fuselage? 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  It put a fucking huge hole, and that's probably doing a few hundred miles an hour.  You stupid birds.  Get out of our way.  Man.  Well, SNL.  SNL might have taken Jimmy's catchphrase.  This is the second thing in a row that people are saying that they got from Chip.  And people are going to say, you know, get over yourself.  Get over yourself.  It's a coincidence. 
[00:23:00]  But it's like last week there was kind of a Chip Chipperson kind of bit.  But we've known over the years that, you know, all these shows have writers and, you know, they're influenced.  And sometimes they take their influences and they bring it to, you know, what they're writing for.  Yeah.  I haven't heard this.  I haven't either.  And I try not to be paranoid about this stuff because, like, the idea of a guy doing bad jokes, that's not exclusive to me.  Like, I understand that.  It was just a little bit. 
[00:23:30]  That was a little fishy, but.  Chip Chipperson-ish.  Oh, they took your, what they did was they took your bit and they made it better, Jimmy.  Fucking assholes.  See, your bits are for radio.  This is, you know, made for TV.  Right.  Right.  And TV way more important than this dumb seller radio show.  What's the deal, Travis?  You took a look.  So, yeah, it's basically Christina Applegate was the host.  So she plays a choreographer, a dance choreographer.  Choreographer.  Choreographer.  Oh, very good.  And, you know, she's very out there and she's, the students aren't understanding what she's asking them to do. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, okay.  So I pulled five clips because it's a five minute.  It's five minutes long.  Yeah, it's a long.  Okay.  Five minutes.  Yeah.  How we got?  I got moving on.  Ready?  Here we go.  Wait.  I'm confused.  Yeah, sorry.  You just said donka-dunka. 
[00:24:30]  Yes, that's correct.  And from the donka-dunka, we have a cock.  We have a zow, zow, zow, zow.  You got that?  All right.  Yuck.  This don't make no sense.  So does he say it again?  He says it through the entire fucking four more tracks.  Oh, that's the bit?  Four more tracks.  Yeah, this is the bit.  That's the bit.  Is him saying that?  This is Fosse, honey.  We don't do one, two, threes.  We do kadunks, kadunks, zah, zahs. 
[00:25:00]  All right?  So a kaduk is a three?  That don't make no sense.  Okay, you people know who I am, right?  That sounds...  He's even delivering it like that.  Yeah, that's the thing, is that when he's talking regularly during this skit, he doesn't talk like that.  Oh, boy.  Well, I don't know.  Let's see.  You've heard the Tommy Toon stories, I'm sure, right?  We were a hot item.  And for that one crazy night, he loved me with every bit of his body except for his dong. 
[00:25:30]  Do you understand that?  I would say it was hard on me, but no, really.  It just laid there like a steamed carrot.  Why'd you tell that story?  It's a bad reflection on you.  That don't make no sense.  Okay, moving on.  Moving on.  Hmm, hmm, hmm. 
[00:26:00]  That don't make no sense.  I'll tell you why I'm getting annoyed listening to this.  Because besides the fact it's awful, it's out of...  That don't make no sense is out of place.  Yeah.  Which is the way Chip does it.  It's out of place.  That don't make no sense.  Yeah, yeah.  And he's saying it weird.  That don't make no sense.  Stop ripping off SNL.  You can hear it in your voice.  Wow, yeah, yeah.  I think something's a mess.  I try not to be paranoid about this stuff.  Jimmy's biting his teeth.  If I'm getting really...  You should be annoyed. 
[00:26:30]  Really fucking irritated.  Just find it, darling.  Own it.  Come on, pulse.  Pulse, people.  Pose.  Come on, dance.  That was it.  Come on, you missed it.  This don't make no sense.  What's your name?  Charles.  Charles.  Charles, what is not making sense to you?  Well, the whole thing.  Mm-hmm.  You. 
[00:27:00]  Tommy Toon.  This song.  This class.  You.  Look, I have an audition tomorrow, and I told them that I could dance.  I lied to them, Miss Chiz.  This needs to start making sounds.  Awful.  It's a horrible bit.  That's fucking horrendous.  Ew.  It's two weeks in a row, though, man.  There's something...  Yeah, that's funny.  I think there's a new writer over there that might listen to this show. 
[00:27:30]  If you take any one thing, it's like, okay, but then you put a bunch of these things together.  Yeah, two weeks in a row.  Two weeks in a row.  Two complete fucking...  And there's been other ones in the past.  When that many people tweet you the same thing at the same time.  Oh, God.  Everyone tweeted this.  This one was...  They tweeted this one more than the first week.  Yeah.  Yeah, I would appreciate whatever fucking writer...  Yeah.  ...is being lazy and listening to the show and then taking little pieces of it. 
[00:28:00]  I'm just...  I'm going to start fucking attacking you verbally.  I'm going to start attacking you.  You know, it would have made the bit better if you would have went,  You're wearing a bra.  That don't make no sense.  Was she?  Oh.  Jesus.  It's just terrible.  You're obsessed with the color pink, aren't you? 
[00:28:30]  It's just terrible.  God.  This is where we lose Jimmy for about two minutes.  He doesn't come back from these easily.  Oh, my God.  What do you think, Jimmy?  That's your thing, man.  What do you think?  It's a little close, man.  And, again, what's close is if she had said something stupid and he said, 
[00:29:00]  that don't make no sense.  But sometimes it's the other stuff.  It's the fact that it's a repetitive thing, which is how Chip does it.  That don't make no sense.  That becomes the whole point of him saying that.  It's the nonsense of him saying that that becomes the bit.  Yeah, it's the way he's saying it.  Slightly with the cadence.  And when Chip says it, it doesn't make sense.  It's almost like it's not like somebody says something and Chip is like, that makes no sense.  It's this idiotic exclamation point that usually could be done without. 
[00:29:30]  Yep.  That don't make no sense.  It's just an idiot saying that's the whole fucking bit.  It's this idiot trying for a catchphrase.  SNL hasn't had a catchphrase in a while.  No, I think they're just doing the bit.  They need a catchphrase.  Wow, that's true.  They always have their dumb catchphrase.  They love their catchphrases.  What do you think, Sam?  Yeah.  I mean, if he just threw it in at one point in the sketch.  Well, no, the whole sketch was this.  I think the whole sketch was getting this catchphrase going. 
[00:30:00]  I think there's a good chance that even if they don't listen to the show, somebody probably sent them one of the YouTube videos or something.  Maybe.  Because all these Chip-isms are also in all the Comic-Con videos.  Right.  That's what I thought, too.  The Comic-Con videos just as much because you can see it there.  It's out of place.  That don't make no sense.  It's just this fucking idiocy.  But it gets to be irritating because the show, like, they don't acknowledge this radio show.  They don't.  No. 
[00:30:30]  It's just, I hate the fucking thievery.  Hate it.  Thievery.  Yeah.  Yes.  And I'm sure Lorne doesn't know it, but it doesn't work.  Like, Lorne Michael is not going, oh, I don't care.  Do what you want.  Yeah.  He's not down for that either, I'm sure.  No, it's probably a writer that is aware of you and then brings some of this shit to his writing sessions.  Yeah, that irritates.  I mean, this guy is a little.  Oh, he stinks.  I've never found him funny.  What's his fucking name? 
[00:31:00]  Kenan Thompson.  Oh, he's horrible.  He's been there forever.  He's been the token black guy for like 10 years now.  And he was the same guy that was at the center of the last skip, by the way.  I don't know if he writes.  I don't know for sure.  Oh, he was on the last one.  Right, right, right.  Kenan.  He, this guy is so not funny.  He stinks.  Well, maybe one thing he's done that's been funny.  Oh.  Kenan and Kel.  All that.  Kenan and Kel.  Nice.  Maybe he is a fan or maybe he enjoyed the, maybe, maybe not.  But I mean, the bottom line is, I don't care what the motive is. 
[00:31:30]  He'll have a new character next week, Jerry Shepard.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  And he's been part of both.  Hardini.  He's been part of both skits.  Right.  Does he go down to the cellar ever, this guy?  I never see him.  I don't do chip at the cellar anyway.  That would be.  I'm just thinking, does he run in the same circle?  How many circles did you guys?  I don't know.  Oh, he's horrendous.  Yeah, and then when you, if you find the YouTube videos from you at Comic Con and you  start searching chip stuff, there's tons of YouTube clips from the show.  Right. 
[00:32:00]  Of you doing, you know, that don't make no sense, that don't make no sense.  And it's a stupid, out-of-place catchphrase.  It's a weird.  It sounds like, it's almost like, because it doesn't even work for this skit.  No.  That's, that's, that's exactly what I'm saying.  That does not work.  It's like they wanted the catchphrase.  Like, they found this catchphrase that they wanted to use so bad.  Well, where do they find the catchphrase from?  Exactly.  Because it's, it's done like Jimmy does.  I would understand if someone goes, that doesn't make no sense.  Like that phrase.  If he did it differently, but the cadence is too close.  Or if it was like, that makes no sense. 
[00:32:30]  Right.  Or if it became, if it was something that, I mean, I don't think I have a fucking monopoly  on that phrase.  Of course not.  But it, but it's the way it's being done that's a little too similar.  Well, you could tell it was, like, they had the phrase before the skit.  Because they just kind of shoot, like, it's not even this.  Someone came to them and said, I got a, I got a catchphrase.  Or the writer was like.  And now let's write something and try to get this catchphrase going.  Or it got thrown in when the bit wasn't working or to punctuate the bit.  Um, because the bit's awful.  Oh, it's horrendous.  Yeah.  It's, it's a fucking horrid bit. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, but if you just wanted to punctuate the fact that, that this teacher is, is not  making any sense, you would just say that this doesn't make any sense.  Yeah.  It's, can we hear the way one of them again, the way he's like, that makes no sense.  It doesn't sound like it changes the way he says it.  Yeah, let me say hi to Richie.  Richie, North Carolina.  What's up, Richie?  What's going on?  Hi.  Um, in the skit, the character's name is Charles.  And Chip is short for Charles.  No, it's not.  It's not?  No, sir.  Lyle Chip Chipperson. 
[00:33:30]  Ah, yes.  Um, is his real name.  It's Lyle Chipperson.  And Chip was just thrown in there because it's a play on Chipperson.  And his mother would always say, she would always say, she would always have the chip off the old  block and she'd pat me on the head, send me out there to get some grape soda for one  of her friends.  Maybe you could use that next week.  And you know, the funny thing is, I as Chip Chipperson probably could be writing for SNL.  Yes.  With the quality of those bits.  Those great jokes of yours, Chip.  No, just, just have her go Zumba.  Fucking home run. 
[00:34:00]  Double you know what.  I'm waiting for that one.  Fucking home run.  Remember, SNL is brilliant.  Let's be careful here, guys.  Let's be careful.  It's a sacred cow.  Yuck.  Here we go.  I would be embarrassed.  That's fucking hilarious.  That don't make no sense.  Oh, Chip.  Wait till you hear the way the rest of this game goes too.  That's fucking good.  You like that?  Yeah.  Easy, busy, busy, busy.  Moving on. 
[00:34:30]  Ready?  Here we go.  Wait.  I'm confused.  Yeah, sorry, you just said donka-dunka.  Yes, that's correct.  And from the donka-dunka, we have a cock,  we have a zau-zau-zau-zau, you got that?  All right, come on.  This don't make no sense.  Fucking A, he's absolutely right.  That's fucking hilarious.  You like that, yeah.  Yeah, this guy's the best.  The best.  Fucking guy cracks me up.  My mother, he looks like a couple of guys  that used to help her lay the floors. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, right, yeah.  This is farsi, honey.  We don't do one, two, threes.  We do cadunks, cadunks, zau-zau's.  All right?  So a cadook is a three?  That don't make no sense.  He's right.  Fucking home run.  That make no...  Home run, you fucking, you know what?  Oh, fuck.  Fucking Keenan, you stink. 
[00:35:30]  I don't know where that came from,  but it's beginning to annoy me.  Well, he just stinks.  There's a couple things going on here.  He just stinks.  It could have even been something  Kenan was aware of.  And he was like,  oh, let me throw this into the skit.  And everybody's like,  oh, this master of improv,  Kenan Thomas.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  Maybe because the bit wasn't working  or wasn't getting what it should have gotten.  That got thrown in there.  You've heard the Tommy Toon stories,  I'm sure, right?  We were a hot item.  And for that one crazy night,  he loved me with every bit of his body 
[00:36:00]  except for his dong.  Do you understand that?  I would say it was hard on me,  but no, really,  it just laid there like a steamed carrot.  I get it.  Why'd you tell that story?  It's a bad reflection on you.  That don't make no sense.  Okay, moving on.  See, right there,  that's where it annoys me  because it's starting something  just to shoehorn. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  That's what fucking Chip does.  Catchphrase.  Eek.  Ugh.  You don't want me.  No, I heard enough.  I mean, I...  That's quite enough.  That's way too close, man.  Catchphrase?  That's quite enough.  Ooh, catchphrase.  Yeah.  That's quite enough.  Get the t-shirts made.  My mother would always say that  when I'd run around with jelly on my fingers  going,  look, the jelly monster's here.  She'd go,  that's quite enough, Chipper.  And she'd hit me in the teeth.  Maybe you guys could use that one next week, 
[00:37:00]  you cocksuckers.  Fucking live fucking show bombing cocksuckers.  How about you use that one on your sketch?  Saturday night sleep fest.  Double bombs.  Fucking shit.  Someone should let them know.  Something's going on over there.  Something's going on over there.  For this to happen...  That was last week,  the other Chip thing, right?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:37:30]  It can't be.  That's way too big of a coincidence.  Like, this one is literally  the catchphrase,  shoehorned into a skit.  Yeah.  Last week was a guy  who tells bad jokes around  and doesn't realize it.  Which, again, can happen,  but the bad jokes...  The flow stop was what bothered me.  Right.  The way it was done as a flow stopper,  and that was the whole bit.  That was the whole bit.  That he put the brakes  on all their good time.  They're all telling jokes  and laughing at it,  and then that one character  would tell an awful joke  that didn't make no sense. 
[00:38:00]  And, yeah,  stops them from having fun.  That's exactly what Chip does.  I would love to find out  if they have two sketches  of the same writer.  Oh, yes.  How do we find that out?  Look into that.  Investigative journalism.  They probably wouldn't tell you.  I mean, I know a couple guys  that work for SNL.  I could probably find out.  I would love to find out  if both of those sketches  have the same writer.  Look, man, something's going on.  Absolutely.  This happens from time to time  with this radio show.  Yeah.  But then you get the assholes 
[00:38:30]  that call us out  and say,  you guys are pregnant,  blah, blah, blah, blah.  It's not close at all.  But I'm not like that  with my stuff.  No.  I don't look for my stuff  and everybody else's.  No.  I don't accuse people  of stealing my shit.  Like, I very rarely think that.  But when it's twice,  I want it to not be true.  Like, I look at it,  I'm hoping this is totally different.  Yeah, you just kind of  fucking explained it away.  It's just going to annoy me.  Well, the good news,  he didn't do it right.  He fucked it up.  So it's not going to be  the big SNL catchphrase  that they're hoping for.  Give him that special. 
[00:39:00]  This will go away quickly  because this Keenan guy stinks.  But then if I do it,  They'll say that all morning.  I fucking don't like that guy.  I don't think he's funny at all.  Yeah, I don't want my fucking,  do you understand  how fucking ballistic I would go?  If whatever person  is listening to this show  and taking that,  I am never going to  fucking leave you alone  if you fucking steal my shit.  Never.  Really.  Stop.  I will blast you publicly  for the rest of my fucking career.  Whatever mediocre career I have  and small amount of followers,  I will attack you verbally 
[00:39:30]  for the rest of my fucking career.  Nice.  Good.  Fucking thieves.  It really annoys me.  Yeah.  Because they don't give us  a fucking damn thing.  There's nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.  They don't acknowledge the show.  They have no affection for the show  or no fucking,  there's no positive feelings  for the show.  It's just don't fucking,  because what do you think  not enough people will notice?  Yeah.  You fucking cock.  That's what he thinks  whoever did it,  not enough people will notice.  Like, oh, I can just pick it  from here and there.  Yeah, a couple of people will know,  but eh, it won't fucking make a stink. 
[00:40:00]  No one will make a stink about it.  Steal something from a fucking big movie.  Oh, that's right.  You can't,  because you know people  will know you stole it.  Yeah.  That annoys me.  Yeah, it should too, man.  It should.  Remember the Cleveland bus driver?  Yes.  He got suspended.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  I haven't seen the video yet.  No one sent it to me.  No.  I was walking home Friday,  and a bunch of black kids were,  I don't know,  I don't know what,  they should have been in school, 
[00:40:30]  I would imagine.  It was a bunch of black students.  Sucker punching someone in the head.  Nope.  Videotaping something with their cameras  the wrong way.  Nope.  Shooting someone with their gun  the wrong way.  Nope.  Jeez.  Helping someone.  Oh, God, no.  Oh, my goodness.  Loudly imitating this video.  Really?  All of them.  And then there was a cop on the corner,  he was howling,  because he knew exactly,  oh, howling.  Damn it!  Damn it!  That's what the cop was doing,  that's not your face.  Damn it!  You're just describing the cop. 
[00:41:00]  But it was true,  it was a full moon,  and he had been bitten by a werewolf.  Yeah, and it was awesome.  Fuck!  Those are all going to be on SNL.  Awesome.  The guy was enjoying it immensely,  the cop,  because he knew the video, too.  They were repeating the,  you going to jail now!  Oh, yeah.  And they were all doing the uppercut  as they're crossing the street.  It was great.  The uppercut is fucking,  the best uppercut ever.  Not the best uppercut ever,  because she did not go down. 
[00:41:30]  No, well, that's...  She went down,  but temporarily.  But she could take a fucking punch.  She could take a punch.  So the guy is suspended,  but I don't know,  I think he still is fired.  I think he's fired.  I think it might be one of those things,  all right,  we got to obviously suspend you  and figure some shit out here.  Unfortunately.  But everyone's saying  that it's the broad's fault.  She was really acting up  the whole fucking time  she was on the bus.  Of course she was.  But they got a hold of the broad.  They got the uppercut.  I can't wait to hear  what a victim she is.  25-year-old Shadiah Lane 
[00:42:00]  of Cleveland says she was...  Shadiah.  Yo, Shadiah.  Says she was...  I guarantee you  she won't say  I was being a cunt.  She'll say I was just...  I was minding my business.  I asked him a question  and he yelled at me.  Shadiah punched you in the face?  I thought just...  Fucking wordfully.  That don't make no sense.  Thanks, Kenan.  That's a good one.  Looks like Bookman from Good Times.  That's what makes sense.  High blood pressure.  That don't make no sense. 
[00:42:30]  I'm a small business owner.  I will never hire someone named Shadiah.  No.  Shadiah.  I will never do it.  Is that racist?  Yeah.  Some of those names scare me.  Oh, man.  Shadiah.  25-year-old Shadiah Lane  of Cleveland  says she was getting on  an RTA bus  to go to work  September 18th  when...  He didn't think  I had any money  to get on the bus  and I was looking for it  trying to tell him  I have money  to get on the bus. 
[00:43:00]  Can you just let me find it?  You know?  Hold on, by the way.  I love this.  All right.  Thank you.  That is one of the biggest  inner city scams.  They get on the bus  and then they rifle  through their bag  or wallet  or whatever the fuck  until the next stop  and then they get off  and do it again.  That's how they get free rides.  Wow.  Stop it.  I also like how she...  That's how they get  the free rides.  I also like how she's very  in control now.  Yeah, where is she yelling  that her fucking nigga  gonna come up  and punch this motherfucker 
[00:43:30]  in the face?  Right, what happened to that?  That brought...  Oh, you wait.  You know, I...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You didn't think  I had enough change.  May I please just find  my change, sir?  Yes.  And I was explaining  to the gentleman  before you pushed him  while he's driving,  you fucking nut...  This is like  the boo got shot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Remember the boo got shot?  Boo got shot, boo got shot.  With the translation?  I said,  and then Pukin came by.  Pukin?  I was talking to my cousin,  Pukin.  Could you do the boo got shot  going in the break, Iraq?  Boo got shot, boo got shot.  To the people?  Yeah, she's very 
[00:44:00]  in control now  as she discusses  the situation  that happened to her  on that bus.  I need to get on the bus.  Can you just let me find it,  you know?  And then from there  it just escalated  to this.  Captured on a cell phone.  I don't care.  If you want to be a man,  I'm going to treat you  like a man.  Greatest thing ever said.  Oh, that's one  of the greatest lines.  I'm not saying  I would do that,  but it's one of the  greatest things ever said.  When you could point 
[00:44:30]  at the floor  and say that.  Wow.  That's right up there  with one step.  Yeah.  That's right up there.  That's a good one.  I don't care.  If you want to be a man,  I'm going to treat you  like a man.  And the bus driver  that delivered the blow,  59-year-old artist  Hughes of East Cleveland.  It's amazing to see  how a man would actually  hit a woman that hard.  Oh, shut up.  Oh, boy.  Is it amazing? 
[00:45:00]  Why'd you get in his face?  She physically, like,  poked him or did something.  Some people saying  she spit on him, too.  I don't know.  Oh, really?  A bunch of people  were reporting that  on Twitter,  and that's where  I get my news these days.  She was in his face.  Again, yeah,  not my tactic,  wailing a woman in the face,  but this guy,  eh, it's his.  She can't guarantee  that she's not going  to get hit  if she wants  to mouth off like that.  Fucking hood rat.  If you want to be,  fucking women want 
[00:45:30]  to be treated  the same as men,  and they should be  treated the same as men,  don't cry  when a man reacts  and treats you the same.  She broke through  that glass fist.  She didn't have  a glass jaw, though.  No, no,  she definitely  can take a punch.  How do you take  a punch like that?  Amazing.  There's not one of us  in this room  that wouldn't be  knocked out.  I bet his buddies  are fucking giving him shit.  Man, you couldn't  even knock that bitch out.  Motherfucking pussy,  motherfucker.  Is it the part  of the jaw he hit  with the uppercut  where it doesn't  cause a knockout? 
[00:46:00]  I don't know.  I know if you hit  the jaw sideways,  you'll fucking  knock her out.  Slamming her teeth  together.  She's just tough, dude.  You think she's just tough?  She is just a tough bitch.  She's probably been  hit before.  What, that toughens you up?  I guess so.  Cleveland.  It's amazing to see  how a man would actually  hit a woman that hard.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, are you serious?  You could have,  you know,  pulled me off the bus.  You can't even touch  nobody, but for real, 
[00:46:30]  like, you really  punched me.  But Shadiah,  you were on the  receiving end of  one of the most  talked about uppercuts.  What did that feel like?  I was on mortar combat.  It just hurted.  Mortar,  what's mortar combat?  Mortar combat?  Why is the woman  asking her that  and saying,  did you spit on him  or touch him first?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She doesn't want to,  oh, okay, okay.  You know what?  Did she say,  wait, wait, wait,  did she say  mortar combat?  Mortar combat.  Mortar combat?  Yeah.  I like that game.  Let me hear her 
[00:47:00]  say that again.  One of the most  talked about uppercuts.  What did that feel like?  I was on mortar combat.  It just hurt.  Like, it was like  a finish him,  you know what I'm saying?  Type of hit.  A finish him.  Now this all went down  on the number five bus  going of chagrin.  And according to the RTA,  the bus driver  has been with the company  for 22 years.  Oh, man.  Meantime,  the RTA has released  a statement saying,  upon identifying  the driver,  he was immediately  suspended and removed  from duty.  His behavior  is absolutely unacceptable. 
[00:47:30]  RTA apologizes  to our customers  for this incident.  But who is not apologizing?  There's two people  involved in this.  What can you say  about your role?  Did you hit him?  No, see,  that's why I want  to talk to my lawyer.  I really want to,  I can't answer that question.  You know what I'm saying?  Where my lawyer?  Where my lawyer?  Why do you have to talk  to your lawyer?  Son of a bitch.  Because she's going 
[00:48:00]  to fucking sue.  But if the answer is  no, I didn't,  you would say,  no, I didn't.  Right.  She's going to sue.  She obviously did  and she thinks  there might be some footage  out there of that.  Where my lawyer?  But now she's got  to find a lawyer  that will be able  to spin that.  Yeah.  That's why I want  to talk to my lawyer.  I really want to,  I can't answer that question.  I need my Jew here with me.  It's more to that.  It's not just like,  it's more to that.  But Lane doesn't.  Oh, so that means she did.  What to more to?  That means she did.  More to what?  With Jackie Child. 
[00:48:30]  So she obviously  hit or spit on him first.  Yeah, let's try to get her  on the phone, man.  She's a big fucking star.  She ain't going to talk about  nothing.  Probably not,  but you never know.  Yeah.  You can tell we won't  ask her anything that she  wants to talk about.  See, that's,  I got to talk to my lawyer.  It's not just like,  it's more to that.  But Lane does admit  that two wrongs  do not make a right.  And she says  she's changed.  And if something like  that escalates,  I would just remove  myself quickly.  No, you won't.  You know what I'm saying? 
[00:49:00]  Instead of even  having a,  he,  the decency even  have a conversation  with the guy.  In Cleveland,  Melissa Reed.  When it escalates.  She's so full of shit.  With something like  that escalates.  She is full of shit.  Mm-hmm.  That's a,  that's a different woman  right there, huh?  Yeah.  That's fucking  such horse shit.  She'll be right  in anyone else's face.  I've seen  a thousand  women like this.  Oh,  stop it.  Oh,  she's so full of shite.  That's nice language. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah,  I know.  Well,  there's your update  on that.  All right.  Guy gets fired,  unfortunately.  Did he get fired?  Oh,  he's not yet.  He's suspended,  but he probably will get  the old Buddha Rooney.  When you get suspended,  you're like,  oh,  thank God,  I skated.  And then you realize,  no,  that's just to calm  everyone down.  That's the fucking,  yeah,  that's the waiting room  to Fired.  Suspended is the waiting room.  All right,  Fired,  we'll see you now.  Oh,  shit. 
[00:50:00]  We fell for that  three times,  I think.  Oh,  no,  I think this time  they mean that  they stole my wallet.  Yes.  Oh,  the Rompsters  got a little lead,  huh?  On the battleground states.  Yeah.  48.  Well,  tomorrow,  another big day  in this whole election thing.  Yes,  Travis's alma mater  will be hosting  the second  presidential debate  between Obama  and Mitt Romney.  Romney,  of course,  taking the first debate.  In a knockout blow, 
[00:50:30]  I would think.  And then,  of course,  Joe Biden  kicking Ryan's ass.  He bitch-upper-cutted  fucking Obama  in that one.  What about Biden,  though,  with the smile?  Biden with his  fucking laugh,  and that had  zero impact  in the polls,  they're saying.  Oh,  boy.  It really didn't have  much of an impact.  Yeah,  yeah.  The vice presidential  debates don't really,  they were saying,  don't really have  a real result.  They don't have  an impact on them.  I was feeling good  after Biden.  I gotta be on  the winning team.  I'm voting Romney, 
[00:51:00]  man.  Come on in for the big win.  I gotta vote Romney.  By the way,  I tweeted that,  I learned that  Paul Ryan was the baby  from the Nevermind cover,  Nirvana's Nevermind cover.  Yeah.  Dude,  it's taken off  on the internet.  Really?  Yes.  These idiots  can't figure out  themselves.  That is great.  The idiots  can't figure out  that that kid  would only be  20 to 21.  So many people  tweeting me going,  is this true?  Where'd you see this?  I need to read about this.  Oh my God.  I threw it out there  as a goof  and it's sort of, 
[00:51:30]  it's taken on  a little life  of its own out there.  People just love  being bamboozled.  They love  a good bamboozling.  So the Biden  smile laughing thing  didn't have much of a...  Yeah, it didn't really  have much of an impact.  I think the debate  tomorrow is going to be  pretty important  right now  because you're looking at  if Obama can't come back,  strong.  Strong, real strong.  It's going to be  pretty grim, I think.  I agree with you.  Yeah.  I completely agree 
[00:52:00]  with you on this one.  People are putting  a lot of credence  in these debates.  It's just a dumb debate  but I mean,  after that first performance,  man, they see another  performance like that,  America's going to be like,  wow, what is this guy doing?  You know what it is?  The political ads do...  I don't see how much  they can possibly do.  It's the same thing  on different sides.  They're just bashing  each other.  When you have a debate,  it shows more  of the capability  of a person  and how quickly  they can think  on their feet,  things like that.  But also these clips  go everywhere too.  It's not just the debate 
[00:52:30]  and that's it.  Like the old days  when we were growing up,  debate, that's it.  It was really hard  to even play a clip  on the news.  Yeah, yeah,  on the news.  But now, man,  it'll be everywhere  for days  if he has another  bad performance.  So, yeah,  it's really pretty important  that Obama  come to the table  as they say.  Of course,  I would just like  to see Romney  kind of, you know,  stomp him again.  I think that'd be funny.  Yeah,  but I think  what they've been saying,  Obama has been  practicing for the debate  and a lot more 
[00:53:00]  aggressive,  they're saying.  When?  So this could be  good tomorrow.  It's tomorrow, yeah.  Yeah, tomorrow at Hofstra.  Yeah.  Hofstra's in a real  shitty area, man.  Well, it won't be  tomorrow.  You think there'll be  a lot of traffic  around there?  Oh, God.  Jiminy Cricket.  Rice Roadblocked.  Good luck on  Hempstead Turnpike,  everybody.  Hempstead Turnpike.  I would go with the,  what else is going  that way?  Metalbrook.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Metalbrook's going to be  a nightmare tomorrow.  We're going local  for the people out there.  A little local 
[00:53:30]  for you people.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All that.  No one will be  around the Coliseum,  though,  because there's  no hockey.  No hockey.  What does the Coliseum do?  There's no hockey.  I mean, it wasn't like  people were swarming  the places even when  there was hockey,  but gee.  It's over, Johnny.  Broken down dinosaur  of a fucking arena.  Whatever it is.  All right,  debates tomorrow.  I'll be watching  that shit.  Yes, I might have  to do a live simulcast. 
[00:54:00]  From the compound?  Live simulcast.  I did drunk karaoke  compound karaoke  Saturday night.  How did that go?  Oh, I don't know.  I have to watch and see.  It was pretty good.  It was fun.  Just hanging out  with a bunch of  like-minded people  that were drinking  and singing.  And then Brother Joe  showed up  after a gig  pretty late  and plugged in.  And me and Joe  did a couple of  fucking acoustic tunes  without the karaoke thing  just hanging out  downstairs.  That's cool.  It's pretty fun. 
[00:54:30]  Very good.  I like doing shit  like that.  Where do the people  find that shit?  It's on Ustream.  You search my name.  Yeah, search my name  on Ustream,  you motherfucker.  Also, World Star Hip Hop  has a longer version  of the Punch video?  Yeah, it's not that good  though.  It's somebody else's view  from behind  and to the right  of the original video.  And you don't really see...  It's not a better view,  that's for sure.  Can you see what she does  first though?  That's why that cut  wants her lawyer.  It again looks like  she pushes him  and you can obviously 
[00:55:00]  see the bus kind of  goes a little wacky  there for a second  when she pushed  the driver.  Everyone saw it.  They were saying,  you're going to jail,  you're going to jail now.  I want to represent  the bus driver.  Represent.  I would make the courts  know that this was...  He thought this was  a terrorist attack  and he had to take  care of the situation.  Oh, good one.  You know, let's roll.  That was a let's roll  situation going on  in Cleveland.  Yeah.  He had to fucking  take care of it.  He said if she wants  to act like an imam,  I'm going to treat you. 
[00:55:30]  Hey, by the way,  when are we getting  the microphones  that Sam has?  Sam, do you know  when we're getting those?  I don't bitch anymore.  No, I'm asking  because I saw those videos.  I'm not a bitcher anymore.  I don't have a clue.  We did ask for them.  We did say we wanted them,  right?  Yeah, I guess.  Weeks ago.  Right.  So when's it happening?  I don't know.  I don't know  what's going on with that.  Does Travis know?  Maybe Travis does.  I don't know  what's going on.  See, that has to go  before the board  and then we will.  We said we want  you try that.  We said, yeah,  I'm not the bitcher anymore. 
[00:56:00]  I'm enjoying mine.  You're an asshole.  But it's perfect.  That type of mic  is perfect  for celebrity photos  and videos.  Can you see my face?  Yes.  Unfortunately, I can't.  For us, it's bad,  but for the overall picture,  it's good.  Oh.  You were a big man  at the fucking Comic-Con, huh?  That's right.  What the fuck are you doing?  How are you getting those gigs  like moderating these things?  I'm nuts.  I'm crazy.  He just goes to SiriusXM  and asks.  What did you moderate?  I moderated the Christopher Lloyd panel  and Q&A.  Why?  Because it was like 
[00:56:30]  it was the SiriusXM thing?  Well, SiriusXM  did like a channel takeover  for Comic-Con.  Oh.  And New York Comic-Con  likes them a lot,  and so they had some open panels.  Oh, I thought you were doing  something separate  from SiriusXM.  Oh, no, no.  And you had some juice  somewhere else.  No.  Another thing.  Oh, okay.  You're just the same piece of shit  here and there.  Another thing he's doing  for SiriusXM  for shitty money.  Right, right.  Just another thing  he's doing for this company,  and the company still  doesn't acknowledge  that Sam does a lot  for this fucking place. 
[00:57:00]  Right.  They don't.  But I'm not bitching.  I'm just sticking up  for my boy.  No, you're pretty bitching.  No, I'm not bitching.  No, no, you're bitching.  Oh, I'm bitching?  Nice.  Yeah.  I'm bitching.  Let's take a break.  We'll get a Comic-Con  or is it Comical-Con?  Comical-Con.  Comical-Con.  I watch SNL.  It's Comical-Con.  Oh, shit.  So we'll get an update on that  because I heard Roland was wild.  Sensory overload for Roland.  Yeah, like a retarded child  with a pinwheel, right?  Unless he sat still  and then it was like Roland  did a Paul McCartney soundcheck. 
[00:57:30]  Newsom.  Was Christopher Lloyd,  did he remember you?  Oh, yeah.  Was he nice to you?  Yeah, he was really nice.  He was great.  He was cool.  He was cool on the show.  And then we got  E-Rock at the Yankees game  with something that happened there.  Oh.  And then we got,  yes, we're going back  into Jack-tober.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  And today we feature...  Well, let's make it a surprise.  Yeah, it's a special...  This way no one can go there  and warn them.  Right.  We should hit them  as we're doing it.  Well, it's a little different today.  I'll say that much.  It's special.  A little special.  A little special for everybody.  Oh, boy. 
[00:58:00]  Love it.  Springsteen.  Major League Baseball.  Playoff baseball.  Song.  All right, we get it.  Not at the playoff baseball anymore, Ant.  Oh, the playoffs are happening?  What? 
[00:58:30]  So fucking Jeter breaks his ankle  and then you go,  all right, A-Rod,  it's your team.  It's time to step up.  And he looks just scared now.  But I can't even bash A-Rod now  at this point because...  It's everyone.  You've got a broken team, huh?  There's just a couple of guys  that are kind of, you know,  getting the job done.  But for the most part,  they're not scoring.  And I want to make a point  about last night.  Oh, boy.  What happened?  You Twitter fucking retards. 
[00:59:00]  It's one zip, right?  Oh, that's not appropriate.  Who was he?  And he was pitching.  Jimmy.  Wow.  All right.  It was 1-0.  Detroit.  And there are two outs.  Detroit's up. 
[00:59:30]  And there's a play at second.  And Cano goes sliding into second.  And he was obviously safe.  Right.  He was obviously safe.  Right.  What?  I was out.  No.  No.  He probably was out.  But anyway, you say he was safe.  They called...  What?  No.  So they called him out.  They called him out.  So he was safe?  Yeah.  Or was he out? 
[01:00:00]  He was...  He was pretty safe.  He was pretty safe.  But what did the ump say?  What did the ump say?  The ump said he was out.  All right.  Then he was out.  What's the big deal?  No.  Well, I started bitching.  Are you confused?  Yeah.  No.  No.  I started bitching about it.  Saying that as a bum call.  And it could affect the game.  When you're a one-run game like that, it's very important that you don't fuck the game up. 
[01:00:30]  Mm-hmm.  And they did.  Girardi goes running out there.  He winds up, you know, later on getting thrown out of the game because of it.  And the people on Twitter are like, after the game's over, didn't do anything anyway, you fucking whiny asshole.  Uh, uh, they, they, so they lost by fucking, uh, they still would have lost even with the, just the one run.  And my whole point was, I didn't bitch after the game was over that the call was bad. 
[01:01:00]  I bitched right when the call was bad, when they still had an opportunity to perhaps win or tie the game up.  Sounds kind of fair weather to me.  Oh, Jesus.  A little bit.  A little bit.  But, uh, with the people that were giving me shit after the game, if I would have kept bitching even after they got nothing, no runs.  Um, and by the way, it wasn't Cano.  But Girardi can't get himself thrown out of a playoff game, man.  Sure he can.  He, he had to. 
[01:01:30]  That should have fired up that team, but it didn't.  And when, when a manager gets thrown out of a game, what happens to him?  Bench coach finishes?  No, it doesn't hurt.  No, no, it doesn't hurt at all.  Girardi gets his, his message across.  Yeah, that's why he should have.  Cano tagged him.  Cano tagged him.  He was fucking out.  And then that would have been the third out.  They continued to fucking score two more runs.  You know what?  I'm seeing this for the first time, to be honest with you.  Because I hate the Yankees.  Look at this.  Watch, watch.  It's not even close.  Look, look.  Boom, right there. 
[01:02:00]  Oh my God.  Look, and the up is right there next to him.  Holy shit.  Hey, where'd you get your glasses or something from a Cracker Jack box?  Take us out, you fucking slob.  No, no, we just, we just got back.  Wow, that's not even close.  No.  Terrible.  It's not even close.  And then they go on, instead of being now out, and the score being 1-0 with the Yankees  coming up, they went on to score two more runs.  Now it's 3-0.  Now I understand after the game, when the Yankees didn't continue to not score, that it 
[01:02:30]  doesn't mean anything.  But at the time, it meant everything.  At the time, it's cute.  So what's the problem?  It's huge.  People kept going, the bats didn't do anything.  They fucking, oh, so instead of losing by 3-0, let's just say they lost by 1-0.  Ha, ha, ha.  All right.  You, you, you, you, you, you, you whining and craning.  At the time, it's a giant mistake.  Of course.  You're fucking, instead of a third out, they score two more runs in a 1-0 game.  The Yankees absolutely have the capability of coming back in the ninth. 
[01:03:00]  They've done it.  And doesn't it fuck up the mojo of the team?  Exactly.  Or something like that happens?  And Girardi gets thrown out because of it, so now you don't even have him in the fucking  dugout.  Can we talk about a manager being thrown out for a second?  I really need to know.  It's the dumbest thing ever, because now the guy is not allowed to be on the bench, but  he's obviously still making all the calls for the game.  You know, you get that weird little bat boy that just, oh, I've got to get some Gatorade  from the back.  And then he runs into Girardi, and Girardi goes, all right, Gatorade boy, tell Blah Blah that  he should be doing this next. 
[01:03:30]  It's got to be a much more difficult process to get your...  Don't you think if they throw a manager out, they should actually put him in like a sound  proof booth with someone watching him?  Someone watching him.  Because I would really like to know what happens after he gets thrown out.  You know he's still in complete control of the team.  Here's what I say you do.  What do they do for real?  You put on a fake mustache, right?  Then you come back into the dugout.  Greatest thing ever.  It's one of the best things.  Valentine.  One of the greatest things that has ever happened in baseball. 
[01:04:00]  That was hilarious.  What an idiot.  He almost got away with that.  He's sitting in the dugout with a fake mustache arm.  Like, no one's going to go, who's the mustache guy?  We've never seen him before.  It looks like Bobby Valentine, but nope.  But Travis, what happens to the manager officially?  I think they just go into the clubhouse.  And then what?  The umps assume that they're not in control of the team anymore?  I believe so.  That's just dumb, isn't it?  Is there an actual rule?  Like, if you're caught doing anything after you get thrown off?  I'm sure you get in trouble if you're caught.  But they've figured out a way around that, right? 
[01:04:30]  But I mean, you know.  With everyone's smartphones, I'm sure he's texting someone in the dugout.  Well, there's no pockets in those uniforms.  Yeah, but there might be some phones laying around where those gloves are.  Yeah, you know what I mean?  They actually have a Skype set up where they put, like, little Skype Girardi in the thing.  Oh, that'd be good.  Yeah.  Skype Girardi.  But the fucking Yankees, man, they look depressed as a team.  They just, yeah.  And then the fucking...  He fucking validized that.  And the home plate ump just sucked.  And I'm talking for both teams. 
[01:05:00]  He was like, he was calling pitches that were way fucking outside and calling them strikes.  You don't need umpires.  You don't need fucking umpires.  Use computers.  Let them stop fucking up the game.  They stink.  That call was so blatantly fucking wrong at second.  That was horrible.  It didn't matter.  See, I know it didn't matter after the game was over.  At the time, it's going to deflate the team.  It's bad for morale.  They're so deflated already.  I know.  With Jeter out, that really blows. 
[01:05:30]  How did he break his ankle?  I didn't see the play.  Well, he was skipping to the loo, my darling.  Oh, God, I've gotten hurt so many times like that.  Once I dropped my diamond brooch and I stepped on it.  He was making a play.  He went to spin on his ankle.  He just played on his foot, Ryan.  But they said he made a play.  He's done a, obviously, thousands of times.  And he just, you know, it's a very rare injury, they're saying, in that situation.  Yeah.  And to see him getting carried off like that. 
[01:06:00]  Three months out.  Oh, that's bad.  And he had a hell of a season, huh?  When everyone thought he was done.  Yes.  When everyone thought he was on the back nine of his career, he said, no, no, I'm still  on the front nine, people.  Big anniversary today.  What is that?  Congrats.  What?  Who?  What happened?  Five years ago.  Oh.  Oh, I think I got it.  The Yankees and Alex Rodriguez, A-Rod, agreed on a record 10-year, $275 million contract. 
[01:06:30]  Five years to go.  The richest in sports history five years ago.  That's all we got.  Five more years.  Wow, you got a deal with him for five more years.  Five more years.  No one's going to take that deal off your hands.  How many home runs does he have?  600 something.  What's the record?  Seven.  50.  Something.  Something.  He'll break it, I think.  I forget.  I think so, too.  Well, you know what?  Well, not hitting like he is now.  I thought he would.  He's knocking it.  He's not breaking that record now.  I thought he would, but he's...  How shy is he?  Sam, can you check that out on the... 
[01:07:00]  He's very shy.  He doesn't like going out and talking to new people.  All right.  But in five years...  He's less than 100 away, you think?  Yeah, but, I mean, he's...  He's not the A-Rod that he was two years ago.  He looks lost.  He also looks like he doesn't give a fuck.  He gives a fuck that he's looking like shit.  I don't think he gives a fuck for the team or anything else.  He had one hit yesterday, right?  Didn't he strike out with the bases loaded, though?  Yeah.  They left bases loaded like three times. 
[01:07:30]  It was ridiculous.  Did he strike out with runners on again?  That cocksucker.  Yeah.  Oh, guys.  Not doing anything.  But he did.  He did get a single.  Who cares?  On the ninth and two outs?  Oh, you're kidding.  Okay.  He's 115 away.  115?  Yeah.  So 20...  He's got a chance.  In five years?  Yes.  I think he easily...  He's got to figure out what the fuck's wrong with his swing.  Oh, man.  He can't fucking hit righties.  I'll tell you what it is.  He can't hit after fucking...  After September.  He's a hunk of garbage.  How many did he have this year?  How many home runs?  Well, he was also injured for a long time. 
[01:08:00]  Right.  Very injured.  Barring injuries, of course.  He had a strange year.  I'd love to see him come three short.  Yeah.  Fuck him.  Because he's just such a cunt.  Even though I want the Yankees to have that record again, but not...  I just hate him.  The home run record.  Yeah.  They fucking dropped the first two at home to Detroit.  Now they've got to go...  If only Raul Abanez could play every position and every bat for you guys. 
[01:08:30]  Raul.  He's unbelievable.  He's Mr. fucking October for the Yankees, but Jesus.  It's just bad.  They can't fucking hit.  Cano set the record for a...  Yeah.  Cano is just in a fucking slump.  Longest over in postseason.  Terrible.  Robbie Cano!  Don't you know?  Yep.  Robbie Cano!  Will you get a hit?  No!  No!  Robbie Cano!  Doesn't he blow? 
[01:09:00]  Another A-bomb for A-Rod.  It just means something different.  Yes.  It's terrible.  Oh, I mean, you guys will do well game three in Detroit.  When's that?  Tomorrow?  Only against the best pitcher in baseball.  Yeah, I know.  I'm not worried about them on the road.  Best pitcher in baseball!  Don't mean much for in baseball.  And there weren't a lot of people at the stadium yesterday.  Iraq was there.  Iraq, were there a lot of empty seats?  That stadium was maybe half-filled.  Because the fucking owners, first of all, have $1,500 seats. 
[01:09:30]  Who the fuck is paying that?  No.  They've been about $4,000 or $5,000 shy of something.  They have the special section where it's $1,500 a seat, yes.  But we're talking about basic fucking seats.  Tickets you can get on StubHub for like $50.  What's that about, do you think?  People would rather watch it at home?  I think Yankee fans are so spoiled that if it's not the World Series, they don't really care.  That's what I think.  Well, Camden Yard wasn't sold out.  Yes, it was.  Okay. 
[01:10:00]  I mean, look, Cincinnati's selling out like 1 p.m. afternoon weekday playoff games,  and the Yankees can't sell out a Saturday night.  And DRock said they moved them.  Yeah, they moved people on Saturday, too.  In the second inning.  Well, it's because the stadium was unbalanced.  It's like when you fly a prop plane.  Can we put you in this section?  Oh, wow.  Yard, they moved you to where the cameras are going to be?  Yeah, near the foul pole in right field where all the home runs were going the night before. 
[01:10:30]  That section was completely empty until they started moving people.  Come on, really?  Yeah, section 206.  And they just moved everyone down.  Yeah.  They did it Saturday night, too.  They would just come up to random people and say, hey, would you like better seats?  Yes.  Would you like to upgrade?  And then you follow them, and they brought you to this section.  And then you watch on TV, and you're thinking, man, this place is sold out.  Right?  Yeah, they were moving people from the 300s and 400s down to the field level and the bleachers outfield area. 
[01:11:00]  So they were just looking for people in the 400s, and they went to you?  It's a pounds joke.  Nothing better than a good pounds joke.  Did you get it?  I got it.  Did you enjoy the game?  You're not really a sports fan.  I haven't been a baseball fan in a long, long time.  Why weren't they?  But your wife is, right?  Yeah, my wife and her family are.  I love that the wife is the big sports fan in this family.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  She must have been happy.  Her Giants won yesterday, too.  Yeah, actually, because in the TVs in the stadium, they were actually flipping over to the Jets and the Giants during the inning changes.  Oh.  So you were getting constant updates in the stadium.  And what were you doing while that was going on and your wife was cheering for her team?  Be honest.  What were you doing?  I was on my phone looking around.  He doesn't care.  Was she wearing her giant jersey?  No, she was wearing her Yankee stuff.  And were you wearing any? 
[01:12:00]  Uh-huh.  See?  Giant jersey.  Were you wearing any sports shirts?  I had my WWE Survivor shirt shirt.  Of course.  That's sports entertainment.  Yeah.  That's sports entertainment.  Sports entertainment.  What the one?  Oh.  And bought a Yankees hat.  That was a good one.  That was a good one.  That was a good one.  That was a good one.  Got to love the brand new Yankee hat.  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  Everyone started leaving at the top of the eighth.  Right.  And then at the bottom of the ninth, when they announced A-Rod was coming up, place was just booing, 
[01:12:30]  and everybody else got up and started walking out before he was even done.  Wait.  Someone said to find the Yankee radio broadcast of The Blown Call.  Susan Waldman is hilarious.  Oh, really?  I'll go find it right now.  There's nothing I love more than Susan Waldman.  Susan Waldman.  John!  Yeah.  I'll go get that.  Good.  Speaking of sports, this was from last week, but Woody Johnson, who owns the Jets, was asked  about Tim Tebow on CNBC.  Woody Johnson is the same guy that said he'd rather have Romney win the presidency than 
[01:13:00]  the Jets, what, win a Super Bowl or have a winning record or something like that.  At least he's got priorities in there in order.  So he had this to say about Tim Tebow.  Mistakes.  None that cost of the game.  Those two passes really with us.  Will he keep Tebow next year, too?  I mean, is this a plan?  Are we going to keep Tebow?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  He'll be with us for three years.  And I think he's going to have a he's going to be a real valuable asset in terms of helping  us win games.  Do you know, is he still a virgin? 
[01:13:30]  What do you mean?  I don't really go into that.  You don't know.  I mean, it's just, you know, inquiring minds want to know.  I know.  No, I don't know.  We ask the tough questions here on Swap.  I know that the ladies in your makeup room really like this.  Becky, you're embarrassed.  I'm the same color as my dress.  It's a dumb question in a way, but in a way, fuck Tim Tebow.  Because he's been walking around telling people he's a virgin.  Has he?  How else would they know?  But has he or is it just implied? 
[01:14:00]  Oh, I don't know.  Are people like wondering, well, he's so religious and he's not he's not married, right?  Oh, God.  Has he ever sat on a cock?  And it's like.  So that's just kind of a dumb ass question.  I don't know.  I'm not a big Tebow fan.  I can give a shit.  But that is kind of a fucking entertainment weekly.  Yeah.  Entertainment time.  It's NBC.  So we're going to do a jingle.  Where did Travis go?  We're going to do a.  Oh, that's right. 
[01:14:30]  That's right.  We're going to do a jingle contest.  We haven't done one in like five or six years.  I love these.  Where's the where's the sheet?  What are we looking for there?  Over my head.  I'm a Klansman.  I'm just explaining everything today.  Why are you doing that?  I love doing that.  We're giving two thousand dollars to somebody.  I bet you it's from Steven Singer.  Two G's.  It is.  God, is he our only sponsor after all these years?  He loves us so much.  Oh, we love Steven Singer as well. 
[01:15:00]  Steven Singer is trying to get money saved up to go to the diamond planet so he can chisel  away some diamonds and bring them back to Steven Singer Jewelers.  I got to get some jewelry, too.  This would be a good spot.  I got to talk about something really fast.  My wife delivered a very healthy girl very recently.  But at the end of her pregnancy, her fingers swelled up a little.  Oh, shit.  And she went a little too far. 
[01:15:30]  You're supposed to take your rings off.  Right.  Uh-oh.  She didn't take her rings off.  Oh, man.  And they were very expensive rings.  Oh, no.  That I had a tin snip off her own fucking finger.  Oh, no.  I destroyed the engagement ring I gave her and the wedding band.  Why?  I had to get them off her finger.  Why?  Why?  Would they swell up?  Did they swell up?  And then when she tried to, like, just move them off her finger, that caused all sorts  of shit and made her fingers explode, basically. 
[01:16:00]  Holy mother of Jesus.  She waited too long to take them off.  It's something, like, women have to do when they're pregnant.  You got to take your rings off eventually.  And she just kept them on, kept them on, and went a little too long.  I'm trying to find the picture.  Oh, no.  It just grows like if you fucking, you see one of those trees that have wire wrapped  around it for 20 years.  It just, like, grows around it.  Wait till you see this.  Yeah.  Wait till you see this.  Here, you can pass it on to Jimmy, too.  And I swear to you, this picture doesn't do it justice, but you can still see.  Holy fuck. 
[01:16:30]  It was like, yeah, her finger was growing around the ring.  Because then she panicked.  We both panicked, because we're like, we got to get this off.  And then that was making it swell even more.  Oh.  So I had to get some fucking tin snips, basically.  Some, whatchamacallit.  Oh, boy.  And I thought I was going to snip her skin, man.  Really?  I was this close to taking us to the local firehouse.  I'm like, they'll figure it out.  Oh, you got the little nibbler, like a fucking wire cutter. 
[01:17:00]  Wire cutter, thank you, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  So I had to get it under the ring without touching her skin.  And I go, look, I'm going to squeeze this thing as hard as I can.  There's a good chance I'm going to fucking pinch you.  She goes, we got to do this.  Because her fingers were starting to turn purple, too.  Oh, my God.  Everything was cool.  And she just decided, all right, it's time to take them off.  But it was too late.  So her working it made it even worse.  And there was no way to put butter or something?  Well, we tried everything.  Oh, wow.  But then her fingers started turning, like, bluish purple. 
[01:17:30]  So I'm like, look, I got to do this.  So I went, you know, as hard as I can.  And thank God, and get her skin.  But then I had to cut it twice to get it off.  So look at the rings.  They're fucking, fucking, they're a disaster.  Now what?  I got to go to Steven Singer.  He'll fix it.  That's why I'm bringing this up.  Because we're talking about Steven Singer.  Yeah.  You ought to get ones that expand.  They have special expanding rings where they, futz, futz, futz, you could open them.  I don't want my wife to have rings that expand. 
[01:18:00]  No, she can.  Oh, okay.  Jesus.  I don't think she wants that either.  Just tape the diamond to the top of her finger.  Right.  A little reverse scotch tape.  Tape the diamond.  That would be pretty cheesy.  Yeah, it would look nice.  But it was quite the scene.  I really thought I was going to end up at the firehouse.  Firehouse over the emergency room and something like that, right?  Firehouse?  They would laugh at me, but what the fuck?  They'd laugh, and then they, bah, bring out the jaws.  It's a life.  Trying to get off with that.  For riding the truck, give you a little firehouse. 
[01:18:30]  But in between fires, what?  They're cooking the sauce and playing some cards, right?  Not really doing much.  Drinking, actually.  Drinking.  Every firehouse has the best bar.  I'm a big supporter of FDNY and NYPD.  I think they're overpaid.  Oh, man.  I used to love doing jobs at firehouses.  It was great.  I did one over in Roslyn Firehouse.  Oh, pisser.  You just go in there, and it doesn't matter what time of the morning it is.  They love drinking.  Yeah.  Yeah, have a beer.  All right.  All right, if you insist.  Yeah.  So we got a jingle contest, and of course, Steven Singer once again. 
[01:19:00]  Thank you, Steven Singer.  If it wasn't for you, we couldn't do anything.  Thank you.  That crack sales staff.  Yes.  Oh, this sales staff.  I'm not bitching, but I'll tell you this much.  They stink.  I ain't bitching.  They stink, except for one particular person.  Oh.  Mm-hmm.  Right?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Getting the nod.  She's aight.  Oh.  I don't like her choice of fucking football teams, but she's aight.  Or husbands. 
[01:19:30]  Jimmy couldn't wait to jump on that one.  Yes.  But the rest of them stink.  I don't even know what they're doing.  We've proven that we're a successful show, and they just can't sell this shit.  But Steven Singer comes through every single time, and he's got $2,000.  What are we looking for?  A brand new jingle for the Opie and Anthony show?  A jingle, a stinger, an intro, anything you want to do.  Just a production piece, really.  I mean, you could do an Opie and Anthony jingle.  You could do an E-Rock Stinks song.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Like, fool around with all the characters, please.  All the new things that have happened over the past, what has it been, five years since 
[01:20:00]  we did the last one?  Five, six years.  Wasn't that the one with Greg?  A Tony show.  Greg.  A Tony show.  A Dr. Norton.  But it's actually by an HIV.  Yeah, yeah.  For a second.  Well, I got a couple examples from the last time we did this.  Oh, cool.  Just to, you know.  Memories.  Just to show the people what we're looking for.  The last time we did this, we had a blast.  I hope it is as successful.  It's time for Norton and Friends, in the morning. 
[01:20:30]  Norton and Friends, in the morning.  Let's play Mott Starring.  Opie is a shit day.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Wow.  Yeah.  Hell, we got that.  The other thing is, like, even if you have terrible production skills or no equipment  or whatever, just do something anyway, because if it's funny, you could easily win. 
[01:21:00]  Well, you'll get some attention.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And everyone's looking for attention these days.  Sure.  Everyone wants to be a star.  Yeah.  Boop, N-A, XM202.  Norton drinks the tinkle and eats the poo.  Monday through Friday at 7 a.m.  Bitch better recognize it's on XM.  See?  We've got the harmony thing going there.  Yeah.  You want another example?  Sure.  I'd love some one.  All right. 
[01:21:30]  Let's go with the Canada Drew jingle.  I don't remember these.  I don't either.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring Lil' Jimmy Narkin.  Ramon, go spread the virus.  Oh, that one's horrible.  That was five years ago, huh?  That was terrible.  Yeah, that was a bad one.  Yeah.  What are we looking for, Sam?  Anything.  You just have to send them in.  They have to be no longer than 90 seconds.  Oh, God.  No.  90 seconds is ponderous.  15 seconds.  Yeah.  10 seconds.  Very quick. 
[01:22:00]  Can we change that, or is it a whole thing with lawyers?  We're not going to listen to anything that's over 30 seconds.  Oh.  I'll do it right now.  Just keep it short.  Do it like a...  30 seconds tops.  I mean, I'm looking at all the examples we've got in front of me.  There's only one that's over 30 seconds.  Just get right to it.  Who was the idiot that said 90 seconds?  What idiot said that?  I love the new microphone.  Was it the radio wizard?  He's generally the point guy on things.  Oh, shit.  Why would he think that someone would send in a 90-second jingle?  How long a minute and a half is on radio?  Oh, my God.  That's hugely long. 
[01:22:30]  Here's another example.  I am a party rock.  I don't know this one.  And get my boy dead, baby, dog.  That one scared me.  Yeah.  I remember being very frightened of that one.  So entries must be no longer than 90 seconds, but trust me, make them a lot shorter than  that.  Yeah.  I guarantee if we say 30 seconds, the lawyer's going to have a problem with this.  Yeah.  Why are we playing the shitty ones from five years ago? 
[01:23:00]  Why aren't we playing the ones that were popular?  I asked E-Rock for the disc of ones that were good.  You have them in there.  They're mixed.  That's all we have from that.  He wasn't going to make you a disc of good ones.  He didn't want to put the effort in.  I got one disc.  It's got all of them on it.  And that's the one you're getting.  Like, it should be the one like Greg and Tony Show.  Like, the ones people remember.  I don't even remember these ones.  You mean this one?  That was my favorite one. 
[01:23:30]  Spread the Hiv.  Spread the Hiv.  That's great.  The Greg and Tony Show.  The Greg and Tony Show.  Entries must be emailed to opanthony at SiriusXM.com.  Let's do this immediately.  We want to play fresh ones right away.  MP3s, by the way.  MP3s to opanthony at SiriusXM.com.  What's that?  That futuristic stuff there?  MP3?  What are the kids doing all the MP3?  It's like the Napster.  Can I send a dad in if that's what I use?  What about cassette? 
[01:24:00]  I prefer...  Are you accepting cassette tapes?  Really prefer an MP3 to the email address.  We encourage that you send in dats.  Email.  A dats.  opanthony at SiriusXM.com MP3s.  A digital audio tape.  It's digital, but you know what?  We just still only know how to put it on tape.  I want their satellites shot down.  So they can't talk about me.  Fuck you, Howard! 
[01:24:30]  The virus is spreading.  Wow.  Wow, damn.  Before the companies merged.  Exactly.  Before we're all one big happy family.  Yeah, we all get along now, right?  Yeah, that's right.  Everything's good, right?  That's exactly right.  That's exactly right.  Yep.  I want the new microphones.  They're great.  Where's the new microphones, Travis?  I sent an inquiring email I haven't heard back yet.  To the Radio Wizard?  And the other one.  How is the Radio Wizard?  I've been too busy with this newborn.  He's well.  Yeah.  He's doing all right.  Yep. 
[01:25:00]  He loves you.  I get out of here immediately because I've got a newborn.  I don't get to deal with the Radio Wizard anymore.  That's a shame.  It is a shame.  Did you get the call of Susan Waldman?  Yeah.  It's not that good?  Listen.  The listeners again?  Listen, listeners.  No.  If you're going to get my hopes up about a Susan Waldman call, it better be good.  It's not good?  No.  It's just...  Oh, we've got to play now.  You've got to people.  No, I'll burn it, but it's whatever.  I want to see what a listener thinks is really good.  It's just amazing.  Yeah.  It's listener requests. 
[01:25:30]  Here it is.  Because you know those assholes are very opinionated.  It's dank.  Here's one more, and then we'll move on.  From New York City to San Diego, it's the Spuds Buckley and Burt Convy Hair Show, only  on XM Channel 202, featuring meaty tits on sports and the Bill's Dead Lady with the  Weather.  I'm not kidding you, bitch.  Produced by Ben's Hawk.  You critique ad nauseam on whackbag.com.  Unless you have Rich Vosfinger to tune your XM radio to Channel 202. 
[01:26:00]  Burt Convy Hair, and this is Spuds Buckley Show.  Nice.  I'm not feeling that one.  No?  There was another one that was pretty good.  Well, I can't find it.  Yeah, well, somebody would have put together the ones that actually were good.  Well, someone was too busy to, you know, fudging around Yankee Stadium, making friends.  Writing fan fiction?  He was.  He was writing some of the same stuff.  Downloading Bikini Girls on the computer?  He loves those bikinis.  Loves Bikini Girls.  Well, I got some titles.  Tell me if any of these... 
[01:26:30]  All righty.  Get you thinking.  Get you caught.  One just called Homophobic.  That was a good one.  Oh, yeah?  Really?  That was a funny one.  That was a really simple one.  All right.  That's a good example of how simple they can be, but they're funny.  I thought that's what was funny.  If you're just tuning in, it's the Open Anthony Jingle Contest.  These are the old ones.  We did this about five or six years ago.  We want to do it again.  We got $2,000 courtesy of Steven Singer Jewelers.  Visit IHateStevenSinger.com today.  All right?  It feels earlier than six years ago.  Maybe I'm crazy, but doesn't it?  That contest that you're playing is not from six years ago. 
[01:27:00]  That's from earlier than six years ago.  It is, right?  I thought I...  Why does it say the last time we did this was at K-Rock in 2006?  Because we probably did it at K-Rock in 2006, but somebody gave you the disc from the very first...  I think this would be the third jingle contest.  Really?  The second at K-Rock in 2006.  And I believe this contest from the audio that we're playing was like when we first...  Oh, my God.  The Greg and Tony show.  The Greg and Tony show.  That's going to be stuck in my head all day.  Yeah.  What about Rape Kid and Crawl Space? 
[01:27:30]  Oh, right.  That was K-Rock, I think.  Hmm.  Homophobic.  Homophobic.  Homophobic.  D-O-B-N.  Anthony Shaw.  Nothing's changed, huh?  Homophobic.  I remember having that because it was before it worked here.  Yeah.  And so I downloaded that and just had it on my iPod.  I used to listen to that jingle all the time.  Jesus, you creep.  I just thought it was funny.  You want to roll through the rest of them? 
[01:28:00]  There's only a few more.  Yeah, let's say if there's another one that we remember.  All right.  We're trying to get these people motivated for the big jingle contest.  Spreading the virus, Opie and Anthony.  202 XM.  Terrible.  No creativity.  No writing.  Why are we doing this contest?  Because you'll find a gem.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that's true.  Every day on High Voltage XM 202, it's... 
[01:28:30]  Ropey.  And Franny.  And everyone's favorite fecal filiac, little Jimmy Norton.  Join us for plenty of...  Puggy.  Anal sex.  And of course...  Delightful Tranny singing popular songs of the days of yore.  The Opie and Anthony Show, only on XM Satellite Radio.  Oh.  Oh, well.  See, this is the high voltage.  That was high voltage.  High voltage.  We didn't name that.  Crazy.  No.  That's a stupid lawyer.  I kind of liked her.  We fought that for years. 
[01:29:00]  She was just dumb.  She had no business doing the fucking creative shit.  No.  Do that lawyer shit.  Get those contracts together, but don't tell us what the name of the channel should be.  My lawyer.  On a train ride from Washington to New York.  Yeah.  The story goes really fast.  She goes, okay, we need a name for your channel.  I go, all right.  I'll think about it, and I'll get what I am.  We'll try to figure something out.  And by the time the train pulled into New York, she already sent out a press release that  was going to be called high voltage.  I'm calling it high voltage. 
[01:29:30]  Because you're shock jocks.  Get it?  And it's shocking.  High voltage is shocking.  And then we had to live with that for how many years before we finally got a change?  23 years.  It was a virus.  And Elo said, I got good news.  Even Elo couldn't change it to, or wouldn't change it to the Opie and Anthony channel.  Well, that's because of Hugh Pinero hated our guts.  Yeah.  He was a...  And the feelings were very mutual.  Yes.  I couldn't stand him.  I wonder what he's doing now.  Ruining some other company.  Maybe he's going to enter the jingle contest. 
[01:30:00]  Probably not, Sam.  That'd be nice.  Chipper.  Let me clear my throat!  What the fuck is your problem, man?  I'll pay Anthony on XM202.  Monday through Friday, 7 to 11 with Jim Norton.  Bell Sparks and Steve C.  Go to Daily to listen to Jim Norton's T-Sales.  Mmm, drop!  I hate that guy.  Oh, yeah.  That voice is terrible. 
[01:30:30]  All right.  We got Susan Waldman calling it.  Remember our listeners said this is great.  You got to pull it?  We call it pulling it in the business.  Yeah.  Forget goodness gracious.  This is what we're going to be playing for the rest of...  Oh, really?  Oh, this is it.  Well, this particular listener thought it was amazing.  And we really need to play it on the show.  Hold on to your hats.  You know what, John?  I know that it's a very tough time to be an umpire.  But these are supposed to be the best of what Major League Baseball has.  That's why they're here.  That was an atrocious call by Jeff Norton.  I mean, atrocious. 
[01:31:00]  It's not even close.  Where do you see this on the replays at home?  He was flat out out.  Oh, my.  And that would have ended the inning.  That's hilarious.  Wow.  That is...  There's nothing going on there.  Are you sure that was the one he was...  No, and she's right.  It wasn't sure.  I thought it was a blown call by her.  You're talking about the blown call at second base.  Her reaction.  I almost want to stick up for the listener.  I'm wondering if he's doing something out.  It's so bad that it can't possibly be the right clip, right? 
[01:31:30]  I don't know.  I know.  Is it like where she blew it where it was a fair ball and she said it was foul or was  it a home run and it wasn't a home run, one of those?  I don't know.  That's a blown call.  No, because I would have questioned what he was talking about.  I knew exactly what I went to do.  Fair enough, sir.  Fair enough.  Wasn't there a bad call by a Yankee being called out when he was safe?  Yeah.  It could have been that one.  Yep.  You should go find that.  You're right.  Why should I doubt the listeners?  It's probably the other call. 
[01:32:00]  Travis Cage when he has to get involved with these idiots.  I hope I'm wrong, though, because no one loves a Susan Waldman call.  Do you like her stuff?  We love Susan.  Love her.  I'm so glad she signed for another year.  Yep.  I'll go find it.  Shit on my chest.  Opie and Anthony.  What the fuck?  Well, we're trying to find that jingle.  The Opie and Anthony Jingle Contest.  SiriusXM.com slash Opie and Anthony.  There's a yellow banner. 
[01:32:30]  Ooh.  You can click it.  It's got all the official rules and everything.  And you can send the entries to OpieAnthony at SiriusXM.com.  All this info is on our Facebook page.  Yeah.

As a matter of fact, wasn't it, like, last year or the year before, one of the Jocktober  victims was one of the people who made these jingles and then it turned on me?  Oh, really? 
[01:33:00]  I think so.  I don't know.  I don't remember.  Ooh, turnabout is fair play.  Am I right or wrong, guys?  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy.  He squeezed it in.  Opie.  I remember this one.  This is great.  Anthony.  And Norton, too.  That's the one.  Good times, great hits, XF-202.  Suck my fucking cock.  That was the one.  Did that win?  I think that was the winner.  Suck my fucking cock.  I love that one.  All right.  Now I'm in.  Now I want to do the jingle contest. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  Because, see, some of the guys were good.  Although I remember listening at home voting for homophobic to win.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I love that one.  This guy, that was Fat Muffin Man.  He sent in a lot of entries.  Here's another one from him. 
[01:34:00]  I didn't even hear that.  Yeah, I couldn't even understand what he said.  Which way is north?  Remember when we used to do the which way is north?  Yeah.  I guess, theoretically, you can make a whole bunch of them.  Good enough.  There you go.  There's some examples to go with.  So, Opie and Anthony jingle contest.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  Yeah.  OpieAnthony at SiriusXM.com.  OpieAnthony.  Yeah.  No and in there.  All right.  $2,000 up for grabs.  Whoa.  Two Gs, huh?  Too large. 
[01:34:30]  Jocktober next?  Okay.  Yeah, let's do that.  What is Jimmy doing?  I was just thinking of, I'm very tired today.  I was thinking of Helen Bergeron.  You just caught me thinking of Helen.  Helen.  What's she got going on?  Nothing.  I was just thinking of a jingle that she could sing, but I can't think of anything.  You know, be afraid to make up some jingles for some of Jim's characters.  Of course.  Some of doom and gloom for Club Soda Kenny.  Yes.  All that shit.  Chip.  Fuck.  Maybe a Troi Kwan dance mix or something. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, man.  I enjoy it.  I like listening to the radio.  The radio.  The radio.  I like listening to the radio.  All the live long day.  Take us out, you no talent piece of fat garbage.

[01:36:30]  How's everyone?  Everyone have a good weekend?  Yes.  Yeah.  Not too shabby.  I got a weird call this weekend.  Ooh.  It's from somebody in Las Vegas.  Ooh.  They're like, when are you coming?  And I said, October 19th, this Saturday.  Or this Friday, I'll be in Henderson. 
[01:37:00]  I didn't see that coming.  In Club Madrid.  Where's Henderson?  Right outside of Vegas.  I love the club.  Is that the first town you hit on the way from L.A. where they allow gambling?  Oh, I don't know.  Do you ever drive through that?  Kenny knows.  Kenny knows Vegas.  Do you know what I'm talking about, though?  All of a sudden, you're in the middle of the desert, and then, boom, gambling could start  right here, and they've got a casino.  No, this is southeast.  Oh.  What's the town I'm thinking of?  It's the weirdest thing, because then a tiny little, I don't know, it's a little town. 
[01:37:30]  But you could start your gambling there before you get to Vegas.  Ooh.  It's the ride from L.A. to Vegas.  That's if you have a real bad problem.  I don't know, but they brag that.  I can't wait for Vegas.  How far from Vegas is it?  Your odds might be better in this place, too.  I don't know.  They brag that, you know, you could start the gambling, and they do very well because  of that.  Mm-hmm.  Well, it's pretty far from Philadelphia.  Yeah, it's weird.  They did a thing. 
[01:38:00]  Philadelphia?  What?  I don't know.  Well, I'll be there October 25th through 27th.  I think the weekend's sold out, so there might be something available on the Thursday,  but Friday, Saturday is totally sold out.  Oh.  Nice.  Well, then people could go to Pryor Lake, Minnesota to see you.  No, they can't.  That's sold out.  Whoa.  Oh.  Whoa.  What about Canadians?  Well, they want to go to Toronto, they can, but that's almost sold out.  November the 9th.  Nice.  Almost sold out in Toronto.  And buy your airfare to Dallas and go see you at the Addison Improv.  Just show up.  You'll get in. 
[01:38:30]  November 15th, 16th, 17th.  Wee, wee, wee, wee.  No, you do well in Dallas.  A lot more date's coming.  You're going to do well in Dallas.  I like the Addison Improv.  I've been there a few times.  I'm worried a lot.  My website's getting fixed, you know.  Yeah.  Should be done anything now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're speeding along.  Searchlight.  It's called Searchlight?  Yeah.  That little small town.  It's like a few miles.  Yeah, it's the weirdest thing.  You're driving from LA to Vegas and all of a sudden it's called Searchlight.  Okay.  It pops up in the desert.  It's a tiny little place where you can start gambling.  Yeah.  Do they have like one hotel or something?  I don't know. 
[01:39:00]  It's a motel, yeah.  It's a motel?  Yeah.  Is that what I'm thinking of?  Bad things happen there?  I guess so.  Yeah, look at this, man.  It's a little shithole.  Yeah, but that's where the gambling starts.  And they have one.  Fuck Vegas.  We need to go to Searchlight.  They have two sheriffs there that just nail people left and right.  Doing what?  Speeding?  Yeah.  And you have to pay your ticket before you leave.  What happens if you don't?  You got to come back.  We'll get you.  You're in a heap of trouble, boy.  You're in a heap of trouble.  Yeah.  You're being a speedy skippy.  How was Comic-Con, Roland?  I heard you were a star. 
[01:39:30]  It was weird.  But I enjoyed it, though.  You could scream things and people react.  Sam, could you explain?  Well, I mean, Roland, because it was his first Comic-Con.  Yeah.  And there was sensory overload for him.  Because he's a child.  He's like a giant man-child.  Right.  Yeah.  And he was just going from bit to bit that he was just doing for his own amusement.  He was running up to people in costumes and yelling at them in their character.  And just seeing how long he could get them to act out the part, even though he wasn't taking any pictures. 
[01:40:00]  Uh-huh.  Like, he would just yell at, like, the Tusken Raider from Star Wars.  I saw that.  And he put his arms up in the air.  And he just started yelling, get mad, get mad.  And the guy would put his stick up.  And then he'd put it down.  And then Roland would still be in front of him going, get mad, get mad.  You're crazy.  And so the guy's, like, sitting there for ten minutes, exhausted of doing this character.  But Roland just keeps telling him to get mad.  That's all the Tusken Raider really does.  Right.  Put his...  Yeah.  I mean, the noise with him, I'm like...  Yeah.  Yeah.  But he's probably tired from living in Arizona. 
[01:40:30]  By the way, you're wrong about the starlight.  Searchlight.  Or searchlight, sorry.  Searchlight.  Everyone's calling, saying it's called something else.  Oh.  Prim Nevada?  Oh, no, that's different.  That's not proper.  No, but this is on the way to Vegas, so...  Hey, yo, hey, yo, Steve.  Yes.  It's called Prim Nevada?  Ooh.  It's called Prim.  P-R-I-M-M.  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking, because I remember seeing a hotel. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, no, it's a motel.  Is that big?  That's on the way from L.A. to Vegas, right?  Got a roller coaster.  That main stupid highway, I forget the name of it.  I-15.  I-15, and this thing pops out in the middle of nowhere,  and that's where you can officially start your gambling.  Exactly.  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.  Yeah, there's Searchlight, too, if you go the other way.  You go to Searchlight.  So, screw you, assholes.  Oh, man.  Where's the other way?  Where's the other way?  Searchlight, if you go through, like, Laughlin, Nevada, 
[01:41:30]  then you go through Searchlight.  Make a left?  All right.  All right, I guess there's a few of these places,  but I was talking about the main road into Vegas.  Right.  Laughlin, Nevada is the smallest one before Vegas.  All right, fair enough.  We're both right, I guess.  Yeah.  Any other stories about Roland at Comic-Con?  Yeah, just being stupid the whole time.  Like, he'd walk up to, like, somebody dressed as Iron Man,  and he'd go, oh, Iron Man, Iron Man,  and then Iron Man would turn around,  and he'd be like, that's a cool outfit.  Oh, thanks.  Can I get a picture with you?  Yeah, sure, but I don't have a camera. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, no.  And Iron Man just looks at him uncomfortably,  like, well, why'd you stop me then?  Or, like, he did one game  where he just decided to piss off as many people as he could,  so for about 20 minutes,  he just walked up to people in their outfits  but did extreme close-up photos,  so he just shoved his phone right in their face  and just started going,  whee, whee, whee, whee.  Why would you do that?  And walking, like, people would be posed for photos,  and there'd be, like, four or five people around them  taking pictures.  Roland would walk in the space 
[01:42:30]  between the photographers and their subjects  so he could get his extreme close-up photos  and ruining everybody else's shot.  Jesus, Roland.  Since they're, like, comic-con nerds,  they didn't tell me anything.  They just...  You liked it, huh?  I loved it.  Then with all this excitement,  I guess he's talking himself out  because I'm doing the Christopher Lloyd Q&A,  and I sat Roland in the front row  with my video camera and everything,  and so I'm, you know,  I'm talking to the audience or whatever, 
[01:43:00]  and as Christopher Lloyd is answering somebody's question,  I look down,  and in the front row,  there's one chubby guy in a Jets t-shirt  sound asleep.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  In the front row of, like,  the biggest panel at Comic-Con.  Oh, no, you fell asleep, Roland.  Well, then I looked up.  I see Sam smiling.  I'm like, oh, no.  Then, like, we get into an even more,  a far more intimate setting,  which was SiriusXM's little room they had  for guest interviews and stuff,  and some guys stopped by  that we're promoting a Discovery show, 
[01:43:30]  and as I'm interviewing them,  just sitting at a table,  like, the table was probably smaller than this table.  Roland is sitting next to them,  across from me,  asleep.  In the room,  not even, like, in an auditorium.  What the fuck?  It's Discovery.  They're fine.  Ty, from all the partying you're doing with Troy Kwan?  Yeah.  I had a couple this weekend.  Troy stopped by Comic-Con,  but he was only there for five minutes,  because Roland told me that he said  he had to split 
[01:44:00]  to go fall clothes shopping.  It was packed, though.  So he couldn't stay at Comic-Con.  It wasn't his scene, though,  because that day was really, really packed.  Yeah.  He barely walked around there.  Yeah.  What did he buy with fall clothes?  I don't know.  We'll have to ask him later.  I'd love to know.  And then he went to the Yankees game, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How did they look?  Not too good.  Yeah.  That didn't go well.  The chest looked good, though,  and you got the shirt on today.  I know.  But they showed the game from the suite. 
[01:44:30]  They had TVs to see the football games.  Nice.  All right, Roland.  Thank you.  You guys want to do a little Jacktober?  Please.  Yes, we do.  We're going to get back into Jacktober.  We took a few days off, right?  Yeah.  I wanted to make sure it was a big, special comeback.  Well, I think we got it today.  You got that sweeper there, Iraq?  It's Jacktober.  Jacktober.  A celebration of all things shitty in radio.  That's not very nice.  Fantastic failures of pontificating proportions.  That's so bad.  Wow. 
[01:45:00]  An interactive exploration of what makes radio rancid.  Jacktober.  OMG.  Hosts, holes, bits, and stunt boys.  This isn't funny.  It's time for Jacktober.  Jacktober.  I love that this isn't funny that she does.  Yeah.  This isn't funny.  You know what they should have at the end of that now?  Huh.  Oh, yeah, that's true.  That should be dropped right in there at the end.  I got a tree on my house.  Yeah.  I got a tree on my house. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, this should, this promo should actually grow as Jacktober goes on.  By throwing like the worst fucking clip of-  Of this year.  One of the shows every time.  That's the greatest though.  Is today Terry Clifford day?  No.  Please, please.  I'm sorry, it's not.  She's coming.  Supposedly, she said hi to you on your Facebook page.  A few people told me over the weekend.  Yeah, I didn't see it.  And if she did, it was probably fake.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, probably a fake Ted Clifford.  I got excited.  I thought we turned her around and she's into the spirit of Jacktober now. 
[01:46:00]  I don't think so.  I need a picture.  I got to put, you know, faces to the-  Sure.  You don't remember Terry Clifford?  No, I mean-  You don't remember Terry Clifford?  No, I mean the show that we're doing.  Oh, yeah.  Well, we're doing many shows today.  What?  This is one of the most highly requested segments.  Yes, this is a big comeback for Jacktober because it was laying a little flat there for  a few days in a row.  Well, yeah, yeah.  We are doing Dish Nation, ladies and gentlemen.  Yes, the television show, Dish Nation.  Dish Nation.  You guys, this was my theory. 
[01:46:30]  I'm thinking behind this.  You guys are always saying, I wish we had a visual element.  Right.  I'd like to have a reality show.  I'd like to have this.  Well, there's a reason some radio shows are chosen to be televised and some aren't.  How humiliating is it that even these awful radio shows are on television?  Yeah.  Dish Nation is a television show.  It's syndicated throughout the country and it's comprised of five different shows.  And they talk about sort of current events in the daily news, but they give a fun take  on it.  By the way, I can't stand anything with nation. 
[01:47:00]  No.  Why?  Like something nation.  Why?  That brings everything together.  Oh, it's so fucking spent.  We're just one big nation.  What about people dishing across the nation?  I'm starting off a comedy conglomerate.  I'm going to call it Laugh Nation.  That's good.  Laugh Nation.  Everybody's just laughing.  How horrible would that be?  That's good.  Yeah, there's only one that I like.  It starts with an Aryan.  Well, here's the intro that explains the show really fast. 
[01:47:30]  It's Jacktober.  We're Dish Nation.  That's what we dishing about.  We've taken the greatest radio voices in America and made them the new face of television  entertainment news.  Oh, God.  It's going to wind up.  This is Dish Nation.  Oh, the fucking production.  So, you got to work for Clear Channel to be part of this?  No, you have to be the greatest radio voices.  Oh, man.  Why would we ask?  And it happens to be that, yes, all five shows.  Well, I'm seeing one. 
[01:48:00]  They do work for Clear Channel, coincidentally, yes.  Have we done that?  Well, I see one we've done for Jacktober.  Do we have another one on there, or is that the only one?  There are other shows that we've done in years past.  How many people do you need for a show?  Look at that one down there.  Jesus.  And it's only a half-hour show, right, E-Rock?  E-Rock's a big fan of Dish Nation.  He's got to make-believe now, because he works for us that he hates it.  E-Rock's a student of radio.  Yes, he is.  E-Rock, what can you tell us about this Dish Nation?  It's a piece of shit.  Oh.  Oh, you're right.  What makes it a piece of shit?  Because it's...  E-Rock likes anything on a dish. 
[01:48:30]  Throw his a pancake show.  Did he piss you off over the weekend?  Because you're going hard after.  No, I love E-Rock.  Oh, okay.  Great.  It's different than usual.  Bigger than you.  A little more than usual, right, E-Rock?  No.  Is it?  I think it's about there.  About the same.  Yeah, par for the second or third course.  Well, it's a national show, though.  So they get their best radio personalities.  They get their best radio personalities, and they throw cameras in the studio, and they  bring the funny. 
[01:49:00]  See, don't say that they throw cameras in the studio as if they're not recording breaks  specifically for the TV show.  Oh, really?  Yeah, none of this is from their actual...  They put radio headphones on.  So what do they do?  They find a topic that's really hot.  Yep.  And then they have all these shows, I would assume, comment on, and then they edit it together  to make it almost look like something good.  Yep.  Well, it'll look like something great is what they do.  Yeah?  All right.  So guess what?  We start with Scott and Todd.  Oh, good.  Scott and Todd. 
[01:49:30]  There's a tree on my house.  Yeah.  Every other show on this thing looks like they're doing their radio show, except Scott  and Todd, they have fake pull-ups behind them, and all the equipment is moved out of the  way, and they're looking right at the camera.  Oh, no.  So they don't even want it to look like they're on the air.  Yeah.  Well, they don't have like a...  They used to have a little fat Nagel kid that would run around and help them out with  stuff.  Hey, where's that Nagel kid?  Where's that little fat kid that used to run around here and eat my donuts?  Where's that Nagel kid?  I got a tree on my house. 
[01:50:00]  When Nagel kid sits around the house, he sits around the house.  Yeah, he'd always hit buttons.  Sounds like Larry Flint.  Yeah.  That's horrible.  It really is.  Scott and Todd, well, they talk about some puppies on Kathy, Lee, and Hoda.  Oh.  Yeah.  Kathy, Lee, and Hoda had like puppies on their show, and I guess Kathy  Lee dropped one.  Oh, jeez.  That was good.  I guess it was a story that everybody was talking about because we had to make sure...  Why weren't we talking about it, Sam?  Because the puppy just...  Why?  ...fell and then walked away, and it was... 
[01:50:30]  What's more embarrassing for Kathy Lee?  Dropping a puppy on the floor or her husband Giff in a hotel room trying to get anal sex from  a fucking prostitute?  What's more embarrassing?  Well, I'm going to have to think about that one for a while.  Yeah.  I'll have an answer for you.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You know what would be great?  She's a mess, too, on TV.  The show Dish Nation was like Scott and Todd.  They're like, ah, Kathy, they dropped a puppy.  And then Blaine and Alice, he goes, I can't believe they dropped a puppy.  And then it goes to Anthony going, what's more embarrassing? 
[01:51:00]  What's more embarrassing?  Yeah.  Just horrid, like, offensive.  No wonder she drinks wine on her TV show.  And then Todd writes a song, one, two, three, I dropped a puppy.  Stinks.  Embarrassed like my hubby.  Likes to put it in her hole where it comes out the doo-Dee.  Right.  Got it.  Look, guys, we're just jealous because we're not on Dish Nation.  It's a national show, you know.  It's true.  Camera goes to Ant and he's making breast cancer jokes.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:51:30]  Is that why we're not on Dish Nation?  It's just not a joking matter.  Sam, what do we have to do to get on Dish Nation?  It should be one of our goals.  I think you have to, honestly, I don't want to offend you guys, but just improve as jocks.  You know, kind of bring your talent level up.  Fair enough.  Sometimes the truth hurts.  Yeah.  I like a lot of these shows.  Fair enough.  Did we try to get Pete's house as he's not doing radio?  He's not coming up here at all.  I hear the MSNBC.  I can't look at it without thinking.  I'm a pedophile now.  I read a really long article on this book and, oof, people say this book is just so-so. 
[01:52:00]  I am?  Yeah.  Well, anyone that's not plugging a book on radio is a dummy.  Yeah.  He's, well, let's.  One of the top names, they couldn't put it into words.  Why did he get out of the shadow?  You know, there's that great line in A Hard Day's Night where the.  Ah, whatever.  Oh, boy.  All right, here's this.  I'd rather do Dish Nation for Jacktober, which got in time.  Because we got to hurry along because we have the nicest man in the world coming in.  I'm already here, Opie.  You were the runner-up.  You know that.  Yes, I was.  Henry Winkler's coming in today. 
[01:52:30]  He's just nice.  Let's make him, like, not nice today.  Try to get the villainous side of him.  You know it's in there somewhere if you poke hard enough.  It'd be funny if it didn't take much.  Oh, man.  I'd be like, yeah, my friend's a Jew.  They run Hollywood!  All right, Jacktober.  For Dish Nation, Scott and Todd.  You know the last hour of that Today Show, The Drunk Hour?  Yeah.  Well, they had another episode.  I don't think they officially call it The Drunk Hour.  Well, they should, because that's what it is. 
[01:53:00]  You know, he really added a lot there, Sam.  You think so?  Yeah.  Where's the video?  Of the show?  No, I didn't get it.  They don't post their full episodes.  Oh.  But do you understand what Scott added there?  Wait.  Do you understand?  They both sound the same kind of now.  Wow.  Wow.  Todd was saying it's The Drunk Hour, and Scott said, I don't think they really call it The Drunk Hour.  Call it The Drunk Hour.  He added a lot.  He added a lot there.  And it's important, because some people would say, oh, The Drunk Hour.  But thanks to Scott, they go, oh, it's not actually called that. 
[01:53:30]  That's right.  I'll let you know again.  I don't think they officially call it The Drunk Hour.  Well, they should, because that's what it is.  Happy Hour, I think they call it.  Yeah, right.  Happy Hour.  The Drunkest Hour on television.  And I'm counting Jersey Shore, too.  Boo, boo, boo.  Anyway, they had puppies on the other day.  Now, this spells disaster.  Whenever there's Kathie Lee and Hoda and alcohol and puppies, you know it's a recipe for disaster.  Now, I'm going to get you both.  Puppies, it's about me.  I'm going to get you.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, it is.  Oh.  It's going to break down on its head.  Did you see the other dog came running up there like, dump me on my head, too?  My turn, my turn.  I think the dog's communicating.  Dump me on my head, too.  Dump me on my head, too.  Dump me on my head, too.  So, guess what?  That's a video of Kathie dropping the dog, like you said.  Yeah, I want to see this.  Yeah, and then another dog comes running up and says, drop me on my head, too.  Is that what happened, Sam?  I don't think the puppy ever said that.  I think that was sort of Scott Shannon.  A puppy on national TV.  Uh-huh.  That's a puppy on national TV. 
[01:54:30]  Kathie Lee Gifford drops a puppy on national TV.  Oh, it jumped, though.  That thing is sick fucking.  Yeah, that's what people with my mother would always say to me.  Chipper, I think I dropped you on your head too many times.  Your brains are all screwy.  These entertainment shows, they just suck a dick.  She didn't drop the puppy and they're making a big deal out of it. 
[01:55:00]  It's one of those things where you try to pick up a puppy and it's like, fuck you, I don't want to be held right now.  It jumped out of her hands a little.  And it kind of jumps out of her hands.  What are they talking about?  And it hit like...  I'm going to get you...  Eh, that's nothing.  It's fine.  She didn't drop it.  The dog didn't want to be next to Kathie Lee's fucking...  Not like fucking Michael Vick.  Fucking wine breath.  She spikes it.  Her...  The stench of her cunt was offending the dog.  And he wanted to go by people's feet because the smell is better.  Oh, look at him.  This is not going to...  That thing's adorable.  This is not going to help you guys get on Dish Nation. 
[01:55:30]  You can't say, fuck Dish Nation.  Oh, man.  Well, with that attitude.  Dog came running up there like, dump me on my head too.  My turn, my turn.  I think the dogs communicate with one another on the show.  Listen, if she drops you, that'll be great for all of us.  So let her drop you first and then I'll get adopted.  It's like the Cider House rules.  Remember when they drove the car up there and all the little kids were,  adopt me, adopt me, take me.  That's what the dogs are doing.  What happened there? 
[01:56:00]  Wow.  The music's good in the background.  It's not distracting at all.  Well, that's so they could go to the next stupid radio show.  And it's just to keep it moving.  And then they have the little needle scratch, which is just great.  It's still so topical and funny.  The needle scratch when you stop something.  Well, people still use turntables all the time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Was that really the end of the...  Why is Obama delivering pizzas?  That's not what he does!  Boy, he's delivering pizzas.  That's really nice.  Hopefully after November.  Or, well, just next December.  Yeah, he's actually, yeah, he delivered a whole bunch of pizzas. 
[01:56:30]  For what reason?  Just to be a good guy.  Well, because the people are broke, because they're out of work.  You know what?  That's a nice thing to do.  My vote.  Obama.  Wow.  Man.  Fuck Romney.  Romney's not delivering pizzas.  Yeah, but pizza's not a nutritious thing.  Like, you need something with substance if you're going to have a meal.  Yeah, what does his Budinsky wife have to say about that?  Right.  It's not good for you.  That's a little flip-floppy, actually.  No, I'm going to hold strong, man.  I like pizza, so that means my vote goes to Obama.  You're here first.  Okay.  That's my vote this time around.  Dish Nation for Jack Tober, and then we move on to the Ricky Smiley Show. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  That's that.  I got Smile right in the name.  What's the Ricky Smiley Show?  It's got to be good.  I think that's Atlanta.  What does he look like?  Let me see if I know him.  It sounds like a black guy.  It's a black guy.  Oh, it is a black guy.  I don't know this guy.  Look at him.  He's wearing a little hoodie there.  Very threatening.  But he's lucky enough to be on Dish Nation, and we're not, so good luck.  Well, it's not a matter of him.  It's a matter of talent.  Talent.  Yeah.  What is this?  A radio show?  Or I think he's got a...  What is that?  Because it's all very visual.  It looks like it's on a sitcom. 
[01:57:30]  Is he like a sitcom guy with a radio show?  With a smiley show.  Oh, TV One, where black life unfolds.  So you have not checked that channel out yet.  I don't think I subscribe to TV One, where black life unfolds.  Is that the Cleveland bus TV station?  Yeah.  It's all fucking security cam footage.  Everything's in fucking portrait mode.  Well, let's listen to the Ricky Smiley show as we do Jocktober today, featuring this dumb  TV show called Dish Nation that features a bunch of radio shows. 
[01:58:00]  I hope that makes sense.  I hope the music is still there.  Hi.  My name is...  Oh, you know what?  Oh.  I forgot.  What makes this show special?  Yeah.  They all have to comment on the dog clip.  Yeah.  Of course.  This is more about the dog clip.  Oh, okay.  I apologize, Ant.  All right.  Now I get it.  So they're now going to do their version of the Kathy Lee dog clip.  Okay.  Hi.  Hi. 
[01:58:30]  My name is Fred.  Your name's the dog, Fred.  And I'm a puppy dog.  And what happened?  Kathy Lee dropped me on my little bitty head.  On the Today Show.  So you got your ears bandaged up.  Is that what it is?  My fault for attending the show on Thirsty Thursdays.  Because they get lit on Thursdays.  Don't drink and hold a dog at the same damn time.  Oh, wow. 
[01:59:00]  This is so bad.  Do you and your representatives plan on suing?  Absolutely not.  Here's why.  I'm three months old.  You sure do talk well to be three months.  Not only am I cute.  And a TV star now.  But I'm also up for adoption.  Holy fuck.  It just makes you mad, man.  That's really good.  That's what I was thinking, Chip.  That was embarrassing.  What were they doing? 
[01:59:30]  The guy had cups on his head, like dog ears.  Right.  I want to see the videos.  I know.  Why can't we watch them?  They want you to watch it.  Well, there's got to be a place online to get them.  Oh, there's got to be.  There's Brandy right there.  Yo, Brandy, what up?  Brandy.  Yo, Brandy in the house.  She's pretty.  You get a picture with Brandy?  No.  That's a big one.  You should go get that.  She was Moesha.  I know.  That's Moesha.  I got some weird fans.  She loves God and stuff.  Oh, they got weird fans?  Yeah.  You don't want the Moesha?  I don't know where she is. 
[02:00:00]  She just started to walk away.  She just went that way.  She just went that way.  Go with...  Look at Jimmy.  I'm serious.  It is a big one, and I know you like your celebrity photos.  Fuck it.  She gone?  Jimmy, are you all right?  Oh, God.  I think we need to take Jimmy's temperature.  You all right?  Is she leaving?  Oh.  Kenny said no.  Oh, all right.  Well, she was leaving Sway.  What's this?  What's up?  Let's go to another interview.  All right.  Let's see if I can get a picture of it, if I'm allowed to.  Okay.  You want to touch the crack of my ass?  Oh, God damn it.  Goodness gracious.  Oh, God.  I'm so little weird fans. 
[02:00:30]  Why would you do that to a...  Why would you do that to a woman?  Why wouldn't you is the question.  On the Dish Nation Facebook page, there's an animated GIF of a woman getting shat upon.  Oh, is he dropping logs?  Yeah, that guy has a great fucking bunch of doo-doos.  Looks like insects.  Oh, that's terrible.  What do their fans do?  That's on the Dish Nation.  He's dropping mice.  He's dropping mice.  It does look like Gary Oldman when he ran out of the room as Dracula. 
[02:01:00]  What the fuck's wrong with Dish Nation that they would allow that on their Facebook page?  Oh, no.  On their Facebook page.  Why did Dewey make love of a good morning, cunt?  There's a shit video on my Facebook page.  There's a log on my head.  I understand why this is strange.  What's up?  What's up?  Somebody on their Facebook just wrote, Eric Nagel is your biggest fan, but he sent us here to trash you guys.  Oh, man.  Why would you do that?  That makes sense.  Good morning, cunts.  Okay, faggots, your turn. 
[02:01:30]  Gary Sinise, colon.  This is my fat wife, Gary Sinise, colon.  I don't like being roped into this.  No.  No fat wife.  Wow.  Yeah, she laid on top of me.  She bent my middle leg first.  Wow.  Titanium, I think.  Stuff they use on a space jump.  No, it's spatial.  There's probably some involved in that, too.  Titanium.  Titanium.  Titanium.  Oh, jeez.  Here's a picture of Travis.  Why is Travis in little purple bikinis bottoms? 
[02:02:00]  It says, Travis Teft loves Lady Gaga, but he hates your radio show.  And there is on Travis's bare chest.  Yes.  Painted on I heart Gaga.  And he's flipping the bird, though, walking down the street.  Yeah, his big nipples.  Looks like the gay parade.  I guess this is when Travis marched into Pride Parade.  Right.  Yeah.  I think that was just the Columbus Day Parade.  Oh.  Oh.  He shaved all his body hair, I guess?  Yeah.  Oh.  He tends to do that.  Twinkish.  And you can almost see his bag.  He's getting ready for these parades.  Yeah.  I don't really understand what the Rick Smiley show was doing there, Sam. 
[02:02:30]  Just having a little fun with the story.  The Rick Smiley show.  It was so bad.  So that was the puppy talking, I guess?  Terrible.  Yeah.  Somebody was playing the part of the puppy.  Oh.  Dish Nation.  And we're featuring them on Jocktober.  We move on to the next clip, which is another radio show.  Right.  There's a variety pack today.  Got a variety pack of radio shows.  It's the Blaine and Allison show.  Yes.  Blaine and Allison.  Where are they from?  Now, is Blaine the guy that used to work on PLJ there, EROC? 
[02:03:00]  No, different Blaine.  Different Blaine.  This is Blaine Fowler.  And Allison Martinick.  Those have to be made up for showbiz names.  We've done Blaine and Allison before.  They're Detroit's finest radio program.  Really?  Are they the best show up there?  They're the best program in Detroit, yeah.  What kind of station they work on?  96.3 WDVD.  DVD.  They replaced Rocky and the other Blaine.  Where's Rocky Allen?  Retired.  He's got all medical problems and stuff.  What's wrong with him?  Is there obesity catching up with him?  He's a big guy. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  His legs were hurting.  He's a good man.  I used to talk to Rocky.  Did he have a good radio show or was he hacking?  I mean.  They were top show in the afternoon until ONA came back today.  Oh, that's right.  That was the show that took out.  Wait, but they were big before that and they left and came back, right?  They were huge.  Yeah.  They were big in the 80s?  ABC didn't know what to do with them.  They put them on mornings.  Rocky's a talented guy.  Blaine's talented, too.  It wasn't my cup of tea, as they say.  But they did well and they found their audience. 
[02:04:00]  But didn't they leave New York and come back?  Huh?  Yeah.  They were from Detroit, came to New York, went back to Detroit, came back to New York,  and then they're retired.  Well, they knocked them off when they came back to New York.  Yeah.  I knew Rocky when he was doing mornings in Buffalo, New York.  Oh.  And he would go to the spaghetti warehouse and get the corner table and he was like a  fucking mafia boss.  People were like, holy fuck, there he is.  He was big time back then.  It was the Rocky Allen showgram.  Yep.  The showgram.  It was like program, but it said show.  Oh, God.  I forgot about that.  That was the show we took out when we first moved to New York. 
[02:04:30]  And that was a big accomplishment.  When you took them out.  Huge accomplishment.  Was it the first Rocky Allen time here?  Oh, yeah.  It was the first time when they were in the afternoons.  Yeah.  And they had no competition.  They were kicking ass and we came in and changed things.  Yeah.  So this is not that Blaine.  It's Blaine and Allison in Detroit.  They talk about Dina on this Dish Nation show.  Yeah.  Dina from the Jersey Shore.  I watched the Jersey Shore over the weekend.  Yeah.  We do a little side thing here.  Absolutely.  It's embarrassing to watch.  And I know we know those guys. 
[02:05:00]  It seems like a parody now.  It's awful.  And they're doing two hour episodes because I think they just want to get it done.  Oh, boy.  I agree with what they're doing.  They're putting two episodes in a row back to back.  It's horrendous because you got Mike the Situation who just got out of rehab, so he's not partying.  Then you got Snooki living in another house pregnant.  It's horrendous.  I swear if you came upon it real quickly, you would think it's an SNL skit.  Really?  That bad?  It has so jumped the shark.  They should have never done a final season.  How many seasons is this?  Seven, I think. 
[02:05:30]  They're all so famous, though.  It doesn't matter.  I think when Snooki got pregnant, they're like, look, let's take advantage of this and do one more.  I don't think they really wanted to do one more at that point.  Yeah, the situation is trying to make sure everybody's safe because he's sober now, and Vinny's talking about his positive energy.  It's a strange song.  Oh, my God.  That's just very strange.  It's completely opposite of what they were.  And it's really strange.  Plus, they're all giant celebrities.  Yeah.  So it's like it's no like, oh, we're at the Jersey Shore.  It's like, oh, my publicist.  Are they still going to the clubs?  Yeah.  Duke, Duke, Duke, Duke, Duke, Duke. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, Kenny.  What?  Oh, you have to whisper that everyone likes to hear.  Everyone hears the whisper anyway.  You just realized that we could pick up whispering.  Tell him to.  Vinny said he's going to be celibate.  Right.  You don't like that?  Wait, Vinny's going to be celibate on the show, too?  That's what he said.  He said, tell him to.  Vinny said he's going to be celibate.  Tell him to.  Well, good for him.  I like Vinny, by the way.  I like all of them.  You like Kenny yelling in your ear?  No, he's abrasive.  I whispered.  But fair is fair.  That show is, wow. 
[02:06:30]  Two-hour episodes.  Like I said, they want to play him and move the fuck on.  Yeah.  All right, back to Jocktober Dish Nation with Blaine and Allison.  Talking to Dina from the Jersey Shore.  No, talking about Dina.  Talking about Dina.  Yeah, they don't actually get guests.  No, why would they?  This is Dina left her tampon in on the episode.  Oh, boy.  And so it's like.  How do they skirt this?  Well, when something fun like that happens.  Uh-huh.  You kind of just get to spice the jokes in a little bit nice.  And you can count a Dish Nation to bring the funny.  That's exactly right, Opie.  I do believe Blaine and Allison will bring the funny here. 
[02:07:00]  They do.  Interesting fact about Dina.  Does it feel the need to change them every so often?  And then.  Nope.  Why use a new one when there's still a little life left in the one you already had in?  A little bit.  I'm going to take a shower, I'm going to pop that out, jump in the shower, pop it back in.  It's still got a little life left in it.  Is this a budget thing? 
[02:07:30]  Jersey Shore producers, buy more tampons.  I wouldn't say it's great, but for regular radio, it's like.  But it's like why spice in the jokes when you could just tell the story as it happened.  You know what I mean?  That's true.  Let's talk about exactly what happened on the show instead of doing anything with it yourself.  Sometimes it's better.  So she's putting the tampon back in?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's hammering it back in with a mallet.  Yeah.  How do you get a used tampon back in?  You probably don't.  It's probably just something you say on the show to make yourself sound stupid. 
[02:08:00]  That's what I would think.  Exactly.  You can't shove that in.  You need that special applicator to keep it all skinny before it goes in.  Maybe her box is just so big she could just fucking.  She just dumps them in, like a whole bunch of them, and spits them out, and they get ready to fill full.  A little big cunt McGillicuddy.  Well, good news, guys.  We go back to the Ricky Smiley show.  Oh.  That's right.  As we feature Dish Nation for this October.  Everybody loves Dish Nation.  It's something you can all go home and watch and be like, oh, this is what a radio show is supposed to sound like. 
[02:08:30]  Right.  Are the fans enjoying it on Facebook?  I would hope so.  Yeah.  I mean, let me check their fans.  And, Iraq, when is this show on?  I would assume this is a prime time show.  And don't lie, or I'll know.  No, it changes depending on what city you're in.  It's syndicated.  Yeah, it's syndicated.  Like, in New York, though, it's on 6 p.m., Channel 9.  What?  What day?  Every day.  It's on five days a week.  This show's on five days a week?  It's a great show, yeah.  Holy shit.  It's meant to compete with, like, Access Hollywood and things like that.  And we still can't get a goddamn TV show. 
[02:09:00]  You can get a better radio show first.  Oh, man.  Yeah, we're a little too abrasive.  We wouldn't have handled that tampon break like that.  You're right.  No way.  We'd have blown it up.  You're right.  This is weird.  We'd have said, hey, why don't she pop the tampon out?  This is just off the top of my head.  And then suck on it till it's white again.  And then throw it in a motherfucking ass.  Why not be a little more fun about it, Ian?  Why not?  Yeah.  I mean, that's, like, very negative.  I don't like that.  Why don't we tape what he just said? 
[02:09:30]  And let's send our tape into Dish Nation.  Like we're auditioning.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  We could do a, we could video some of our stuff and then take a Dish Nation episode and then  just do some editing and splice our stuff in.  Yeah.  That's funny.  Yeah, it's funny.  It's a funny idea.  This reminded me of the time when Dave Douglas wanted to put the station CD together.  Oh, God.  And me and Anthony's bits, which were very good for the time, had to be mixed in with  all the other shitty bits of the other guys at the station.  Remember that, Anthony?  Rocco, my letter to the, my letter from the, Miguel, the kid that I sponsor. 
[02:10:00]  Was it funny?  No.  Can we play the Miguel letter?  Dear Rocco, I'm here and, oh.  Can we play this?  Do you have that, E-Roc?  I'll go look.  It's off one of the station CDs.  Yeah, I think it's off of, um.  Unusual Suspects.  Is it Unusual Suspects?  All right, let me see.  Unusual Suspects.  Some of their fans are really weird.  It's like Usual Suspects, but we are Unusual.  Oh, you guys were crazy. 
[02:10:30]  Right.  That's crazy, right?  Wow.  Yeah.  What's going on with the Dish Nation Facebook page?  Well, one of their fans is saying that they use dirty tampons as martini straw.  Oh.  Another one of their fans, and this is very strange to me, another one of their fans says,  I love Mrs. Roberts' cunt.  Oh, man.  Which I don't understand why their fans.  Come on, man.  Are talking about my mom.  Terrible.  Maybe it's not your mom.  Maybe.  Well, there's so many people that could probably love her cunt.  Oh.  Just saying.  With his other one, he just writes, sex bagel is a fatty, so I don't know where that comes 
[02:11:00]  from.  There's no cleverness to that.  Yeah.  Keep that going.  Let's hear some more Ricky Smiles.  Sure.  Let's do this.  So, Head Crack from Ricky Smiley's show raps about the VP debate.  Oh, the VP debate just happened.  Yeah.  So, it's very topical for Dish Nation.  Well, Head Crack, his whole thing is he does, Head Crack does rap songs about topical stuff.  He's like the Urban Todd.  That's right.  Putting together some song parodies, but only they're like hip hop.  But with him, you throw a topic at him, and he pretends that he's freestyling, as opposed 
[02:11:30]  to you told him the topic a little while before, and he wrote something.  Oh, yeah.  I got you.  He's right.  Oh, he's off the cuff.  Off the top of his head.  Sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's not easy to do.  I do it, but a lot of people can't.  Yeah.  Something tells me I'm going to have to strap in.  This is going to be an embarrassment.  Why?  Strap in?  Because I'm rapping.  That could be an embarrassment.  It's on Dish Nation.  It's really good.  Yeah.  True.  Yeah.  Don't get jealous.  Hey, yo, Ricky Smiley.  Come on.  Take it back to the hood.  Hair crank.  Hair crank. 
[02:12:00]  I'm not trying to hate, but what's up with the vice presidential debate?  Now, no matter where you riding, with Ryan or Biden, the presidential debates, they were  pretty exciting.  Yeah.  The dude had an ill buckle.  For some reason, Joe Biden stood there and chuckled.  Vote no matter what your party.  Because if you don't vote, that's a bunch of malarkey.  Go, Hancock.  Go, Hancock.  Go, Hancock.  Go.  Go.  That's not bad, Sam. 
[02:12:30]  You like this out.  I kind of like that.  The malarkey part?  Yeah.  And it's just freestyling, you know?  That was so bad.  Why, man?  They were freestyling.  Malarkey.  Head crack was freestyling.  For some reason, Joe Biden kept on chuckle.  Was there a buckle?  But they were sitting down, so how could you see the buckle?  Yeah, I didn't notice.  It's hard to see buckles if everyone's sitting down.  I didn't notice Paul Ryan's buckle.  What was he laughing at?  I can't figure. 
[02:13:00]  He said, hey, Joe, you were...  Yeah, I don't know what to...  Yeah, we got to come up with a rhyme for that.  I was just thinking of one of those.  I like the first part.  I was going to say trigger.  It's just too bad we can't come up with a rhyme, though.  Trigger.  Bigger, probably.  Yeah, yeah.  Go with bigger, maybe?  Yeah, bigger.  Dish Nation being featured on Jocktober.  Good news, ladies and gentlemen.  We go back to Scott and Todd.  All right.  Wah.  Wah.  There's a scalpel on my face. 
[02:13:30]  Scott and Todd talk about a hair produce.  What?  A hair product.  Oh, it says produce.  Hair product George Clooney is on the box for.  The greatest radio voices in America, Scott and Todd.  As advertised at the beginning of the show.  Oh, that's right.  Right.  So there's like a...  I mean, they don't notice...  They don't mention it in the clip, but I guess it's an international hair dyeing and hair  regrowth thing.  Sam, I'm going to give you a suggestion for the rest of Jocktober.  This year, Jocktober, a little weird. 
[02:14:00]  We're all feeling it.  Yeah.  You come back with some Scott and Todd clips peppered in here and there.  Oh, for every show.  Well, just here and there.  Yeah.  Keeps people interested.  We're supposed to be monitoring Scott and Todd every day.  Oh, good.  Good news.  Now, if you're a guy who worries about your hair, there is a product for you.  It's online.  It's called Subaru.  And supposedly, George Clooney uses it.  No, I don't think that's true.  That's what they're saying in their ads.  They're not really saying it, but they want you to think it. 
[02:14:30]  He's pictured on the box on the label.  And there's a nurturing shampoo that makes your hair grow.  Wow.  Perfect for people who are follically challenged.  And want to be like George Clooney.  Yeah.  They've got a picture of George Clooney with white hair.  Yeah.  And then a picture of George Clooney with dark hair.  Then they've got a picture of George Clooney with no hair.  And a George Clooney with a lot of hair.  Pretty soon, they're going to have a picture of George Clooney suing their ass off. 
[02:15:00]  That's the fucking punchline?  That's the punchline.  They suck.  That's fantastic stuff.  Wait, what was the punchline?  I really tapped out.  Pretty soon.  Yeah.  Wait, can I hear?  Oh, they've got a picture of George Clooney with hair, without hair.  They've got a picture of George Clooney with gray hair.  They've got a picture of George Clooney with dark hair.  Well, they're going to have a picture of George Clooney suing him.  Also, Scott thinks that this is his big break, too.  Because he's completely animated when he's on camera.  And he thought his follically, perfect for the person who's follically challenged. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  You could tell him he thought that was going to get the big one.  That's a big one.  That's the big laugh.  Follically challenged.  That's the political correct way to say bald guy.  And the girl's laughing.  She thought it was funny.  There's no video of this?  Not of this segment.  Can't we get it online somewhere?  That's where I checked.  No.  How about we just tape it and bring it in so we can take a look at this?  I mean, if we're going to be on this show, we've got to know what it's all about.  Do you do a little homework?  Yeah, man.  I think we're as good as those guys, hopefully. 
[02:16:00]  Nah.  You've got a little more practice to do, kid.  Dish nation.  Yeah.  And you're not doing enough dishing on the show, anyway.  Yeah, we don't really dish.  Oh, is that why dish?  Yeah, you're dishing.  They're dishing on topics?  Yeah, you've got to dish.  Hmm.  I thought it was like...  Scott sounds like what I believe Fez would sound like if he talked.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Like, if Fez actually talked, I think he would sound a lot like Scott. 
[02:16:30]  What's wrong, Sam?  Scott Shannon's a huge fucking radio star.  I can't doubt.  What's the most insulting part about that statement?  It does cover a few bases.  What?  What happened?  Me and Fez are good.  I said hi to him the other day.  How could you be...  If somebody said that about me, I would be offended.  So would Scott Shannon.  All right, one more for Jocktober as we feature Dish Nation.  It's a guy named Kid Craddock.  I know this Kid Craddock.  Oh, he's on this?  He started out in Dallas, I believe, and they syndicated this guy all over the fucking place. 
[02:17:00]  He's killing it.  He's the Dallas representative.  I do believe we share an agent.  He's great, Kid Craddock.  He is, huh?  Really good.  That's a lot of money.  Well, it's good that his agent then could get him on Dish Nation.  Son of a bitch.  Now I'm just mad.  You're right, Sam.  He's got a good agent.  He must have a great agent.  Who is that?  Oh, that's right.  Same guy.  Yeah.  I bet he makes a lot of moolah.  Ah.  A lot of claims. 
[02:17:30]  Guys, you want to be on Dish Nation?  I don't know.  I don't know, guys.  You know, you had that offer from Claire Chan.  You didn't take it seriously, so I don't even know if I could call them for you.  Guys, the material.  Remember, you were supposed to do mornings after Q104 and you laughed in their face.  Oh, guys.  I really do.  It's not conducive to Dish Nation.  I'm not even sure if it's conducive to radio.  I don't know.  Oh, Jesus.  God help me.  You know, he's called my house five times since the baby was born and I still haven't 
[02:18:00]  taken his call.  Really?  And my wife goes, why won't you take his call?  And I go, because I don't want to bring down the happiness that we're feeling.  Doom and gloom, Bob.  And he doesn't mean it, but it just happens.  It would start with like, oh, congratulations on the birth of your daughter.  You do realize how expensive private schools are.  You're going to have to work for at least another 10 years.  Oh, you're going to realize so.  And then, of course, he turns everything into the worst case scenario. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  But with that said, Kid Craddock on Dish Nation as we wrap up today's Jocktober.  Killing it.  Does anyone else have a problem with this?  Madonna, 52 years old, prancing around her bra and panties on stage with her seven-year-old  watching.  He's actually in the DJ booth because apparently little David has a career as a DJ ahead of  him.  That's really big.  When he's like, did his track suit spin in for mommy.  Yeah.  He's in there on the one and the two, killing it on the washer and dryer. 
[02:19:00]  And eventually when the career takes that nose down, he'll be asking people to put  some green on the scene for my mommy, Madonna.  Oh, my God.  Are we going to do wiggity, wiggity whack?  Oh, that's funny.  I'm funny.  How old is Kid Craddock?  Um, I mean, he's been around forever.  He's got to be, uh, he's got to be in his fifties.  I mean, you can't tell from the picture.  And he's still Kid Craddock?  Yeah.  Well, I'm still Opie.  No, but did you know I'm a kid?  How about Mr. Craddock? 
[02:19:30]  Mr.  Mr.  Craddock.  He's just said.  How about Demma?  Sir Craddock.  So he has a problem with Madonna, I guess?  Oh, God.  He looks like, um...  He's just dishing.  Oh, boy.  He looks like a douchey soap star.  Yeah.  No, he kind of looks like Rock Hudson.  Oh, yeah.  He does.  Pre-AIDS.  Pre-weight loss.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have one...  Kid Craddock?  ...option for you guys.  It's totally your choice.  Yes.  I didn't want to make you guys feel too jealous, so when I gave you Head Crack's rap, I didn't 
[02:20:00]  include...  It's like two minutes long, the full rap.  He's just hitting topic after topic.  Oh, really?  Oh, man.  That's great.  And Jim was asking for video.  There's a video of his rap.  Oh, really?  Now...  Can we see that?  Okay.  You asked for it.  All right.  Let's turn that up.  I want to hear this, too.  I'm going to throw it in full screen, if that's okay.  Really?  Full screen.  Definitely.  There's Head Crack.  Head Crack.  Head Crack's rap.  And like I said, totally off the top of the dome, as they say.  Oh.  Freestyling.  They throw topic at him, and he's ready.  And he's doing it. 
[02:20:30]  Nice.  Okay.  Here's Head Crack.  All right, y'all.  It's time for Head Crack's Rap of the Week.  Let's get it!  On the three, on the two, and on the one.  All right, all right, Head Crack.  They say that she might be a mouse, but tell me what's going on with Chris Brown brought  Carucci a house.  Yeah, he bought her a house.  Carucci Trey could have probably been Chris Brown's spouse, but he wanted to be with that  chick named Rihanna.  He probably could have been with a chick named Ivana.  Hump around, because that's what she do.  I heard that she have relations with her whole crew of people in the entertainment business, 
[02:21:00]  allegedly.  But hey, like the Beatles kid, let it be.  Rock T, what you got for me?  Yo, drop the ill topic on the one, two, three.  It's a fight between mom and daughter.  Lindsey Longhand and Dina with the slaughter.  There was a fight that happened after the club.  She said her mom was on coke, come on, where's the love?  She said she let the mom $40,000.  Something about she had to pay some money on the house.  I don't believe it until I see it in court.  Hey, yo, what you got? 
[02:21:30]  I don't get black people.  The guy rapping isn't bothering me as much as the mugging from the other guys, which  the audience can't see.  And the dancing.  It's amazing.  Well, Henry Winkler's here.  Yeah, so why don't we take a quick break and get Henry Winkler in studio.  That's Jacktober for today.  What's your mood like right now?  Just mad.  He just has no business being on the radio or TV.  Yeah, it's on both.  It's on both.  They each have morning shows, and then they're also on television.  All right.  We're going to take a quick break, and we talk to the nicest man in the world next, 
[02:22:00]  Henry Winkler, the Fonz.  Dump me on my head, too.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Channel on SiriusXM.  We're very excited.  Henry Winkler.  Oh, yeah.  Making his way back to the radio show today.  We call him the nicest man in the world.  There he is.  Mr. Winkler.  Okay.  Hello.  Hi, sir.  How are you, Henry?  How are you?  I'm so good.  How did that book do for you?  This one?  Yeah.  That was the last time you were in. 
[02:22:30]  This is our 22nd, and the second one just came out.  Yeah.  Ghost Buddy.  Yeah, Ghost Buddy.  Ghost Buddy.  You were in here last time promoting Ghost Buddy.  Absolutely.  And this is another Ghost Buddy book?  This is another Ghost Buddy, and then the third one comes out in a few months.  Wow.  Is this a hangout?  This is a different series altogether.  Oh, okay.  It is.  Oh, man.  That's pretty good.  This is about don't judge a book by its cover.  Ah, quite literally.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because it's a book. 
[02:23:00]  It's a book.  But it's about bullying.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Is it pro or anti-bullying?  It is.  Well, you know, secretly, it is pro.  Yes.  But the Ghost, the Ghost sounds like the Fonz.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So it's written like the...  Like Richie and Fonzie.  Oh, okay.  It just came out that way when we were writing it.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  The same dynamic the two of you had?  So the Ghost is kind of a lot tougher than he is, but is a good guiding force? 
[02:23:30]  Well, he's irresponsible.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Was the Fonz irresponsible, though?  The Fonz was not really irresponsible, but the Ghost is.  Yeah, yeah.  The Ghost has one year to get out of the house, or he'll never get to a major league baseball  game.  This is all his dream.  He wants to get out of the house.  But he's stuck in the house because he just can't earn his wings.  And that's how you get out of the house with your ghost?  If you help the other boy meet his potential.  Oh, okay. 
[02:24:00]  You know?  Inspiring.  Yeah.  Yes, yes.  You know what?  I tear up.  Really?  Yeah.  So now, Fonzie...  But was Fonzie irresponsible, though?  I mean, the office and the bathroom is odd, but I wouldn't say irresponsible.  I mean, uh...  No, no.  He worked.  He was a good guy.  Richie was here as Fonz at all times.  And I base the Fonz on loyalty.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, he was loyal to his friends.  Right.  Whether he would admit it or not.  And I didn't know his parents, so Mrs. C became a very important force. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, is that the backstory?  I didn't know.  He didn't know his parents at all.  Yeah.  His father was a merchant marine, and I think maybe he met his mother who was a waitress  in some luncheonette.  Somewhere.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  In one of the episodes, or...?  In one of the episodes.  Oh, I remember that.  Yeah.  Well, it does ring a bell.  Didn't you turn down to...  I'm reading this on the prep sheet, but you turned down the part of Danny in Grease?  I did.  Was it on the Broadway play or the action with Libby and John? 
[02:25:00]  The movie.  Oh, wow.  You turned down...  I did.  Why would you turn that down, Mr. Winkler?  Because I thought I had done the Fonz, and I was going to play Richie, and so I didn't  want to do the Fonz again.  Hmm.  Right.  And, of course, I went home and had an orange juice, and John Travolta went home and bought  a plane.  You regret that one a little bit.  You know what? 
[02:25:30]  Does that one hurt a little bit?  I have to say...  A little bit.  I learned a lesson.  Yeah.  You know, when they say youth is wasted on the young, it's no joke, because I really learned  that you can survive, and just, you know, my father said to me once, make hay while the  sun shines, and at that time, when I was 27, I didn't understand what he meant.  Right.  I understand now.  Right.  So, I probably would have done it if I was asked now, but, you know, I live with my decisions, 
[02:26:00]  and I've done pretty well, and I'm here a second time.  Well, did it work out the other way for you?  Not bad.  Not bad at all.  But let me ask this question.  The O&A show.  Yes.  It's amazing.  I like doing great.  Same thing.  Has it ever worked out in your favor, though, where you were up for something, you turned it  down, and it was a stinkeroo?  Oh, that's a good question.  I think it is a good question.  You know what?  I have not kept track of that.  That is a really good question.  But that never happened to you?  I never.  Well, I have to think about it.  Okay. 
[02:26:30]  I have to think about it.  I'm sure there are some things, because I, being dyslexic, I completely work on my instinct.  So, people ask me, all right, there's a new movie out right now, Here Comes the Boom,  with Kevin James.  I'm in it.  Yes, you are.  So, I'm at the star ceremony on Hollywood Boulevard for Adam Sandler.  I'm asked to speak.  Kevin James is asked to speak.  Okay.  I shook hands with Kevin James once before on the set of Click. 
[02:27:00]  That's it.  So, I go home.  I'm making a sandwich.  The phone rings.  Hi.  This is Kevin James.  Hi, Kev.  Well, I shouldn't call you Kev, because I don't know you that well.  Hi, Kevin.  How are you?  Yeah.  Would you like to be in my movie?  Okay.  I'll do that.  Didn't read the script?  It just felt right.  Mm-hmm.  You know, Henry, I've never gotten a call like that.  As soon as I plug your number into my cell phone, I'm calling. 
[02:27:30]  How difficult is it being dyslexic when you have to learn lines?  It is very, because...  Did the director get mad when he used to go,  Yeah!  Yes.  Well, you know, that was the German version.  We did that in Germany.  Ja!  Yes, Gritschie, you get up here!  I will smack your toes!  No, but...  You know when it's difficult?  When you go into an audition,  and you're given the script cold, 
[02:28:00]  and now I have to read it,  and I have to read it out loud,  not having any time to prepare.  Right.  What I have done is I have made it up.  I was really good at memorizing,  so I memorized as much as I could.  I made up the rest unabashedly.  Wow.  Walked in, and that's the way I auditioned.  And some directors would say,  Excuse me, this is not the way it was written!  And I would say,  You know what, sir?  I'm giving you the essence of the characters. 
[02:28:30]  And if I get the part,  I will learn it completely.  Right.  Did that work, or did they...  Well, I'm here.  Yeah.  I'm here.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  Did you tell them after a while  that you were dyslexic,  once you learned that you were...  At 31, I started to talk about it.  That's when I learned.  Right.  And I didn't realize  that other people never said a word,  that it was something to be embarrassed about.  I just thought,  Oh, my goodness.  Now I know why these things are difficult for me. 
[02:29:00]  Right.  You know,  and now when I travel around the country  and I speak,  I meet people  who are fabulously powerful human beings,  but they are illiterate.  They cannot read.  And they never allowed themselves to be promoted  because they are so embarrassed.  You know?  It's pretty amazing.  What do you see when you're dyslexic?  Like, if you're reading...  You don't see it all in reverse.  What is it?  Is it like...  If you read, like,  a high school biology teacher...  I leave out words.  Oh, it just...  It gets blurry. 
[02:29:30]  I get my brain shuts down.  But for every human being,  there is another way that it affects you.  It is not the same for everyone.  Every brain is wired differently.  You're born that way.  It's the way it is.  I have trouble with those...  The small b and small d.  You reverse them?  Constantly...  Sometimes I have to look  and actually go,  which one is that?  Like, really give it thought.  Yeah, those two.  That gets me all the time.  Yeah.  It's probably very common.  Did you ever invite a girl 
[02:30:00]  back to your dead broom?  Oh, God.  Yuck.  What a dom that was.  I know.  My tribe.  So you'll leave words out.  And then how do you...  How do you, like,  go over a book?  And, like, how do you...  I'll tell you exactly.  My wonderful partner,  Lynn Oliver,  she...  We work always at her office.  I get there at about  10 o'clock in the morning. 
[02:30:30]  We work until  1 o'clock in the afternoon.  She sits behind the computer.  I walk around the room.  I talk.  She types.  Then she's got an idea.  She types.  I wait.  Then she reads it back.  Then we argue over every word.  Oh, God.  And together,  we have written 23 novels  for children that way.  That's an amazing way,  like, to talk...  Because sometimes  the frustrating part of writing  is actually sitting down  and typing.  To talk it out to somebody...  Will you say, like,  see, you have an idea,  like, okay,  the ghost wants to do this. 
[02:31:00]  Will you talk it through  without it being exact dialogue?  Like, just get the idea out there?  That's the way  we come up with every book.  There are...  There's a sofa,  two armchairs,  and a rocking chair  in front of Lynn's desk.  I use all three.  But we sit in the armchairs  and work out the story.  And then sometimes  the next day,  I'll wake up,  I'll say,  Lynn,  I have no emotional connection  to the story.  I don't know how to write that story. 
[02:31:30]  So we go back to the drawing board  until we get something  where I know how to tell that story  and she does too.  Do you...  It's interesting to me  because what do you do  if you come in on a day like...  I had something recently happen  and I've been so lazy with writing  that I just wrote bullet points.  I'm like,  I know I'll get to it,  but I can't...  It's hard to conjure the emotion back up.  Like, when you think of something,  like, you have the concept for this.  And then two weeks later  to bring that same enthusiasm  or emotion back up.  You know what is amazing?  I'm driving across the city.  I live on one side of the city  and she lives... 
[02:32:00]  Her office is in West Hollywood.  And Lynn Oliver Productions, you know.  and I'm driving  and I'm thinking,  I don't know what to write today.  Oh my, I'm panicking.  I don't know.  What are we going to talk about?  I don't have the slightest idea.  And then you start.  And then it starts to flow.  And when I leave her office,  there are eight pages  or six pages in my hand  that never existed before  that are story. 
[02:32:30]  And I walk out of there  and I'm telling you,  we've done this now for ten years.  Next year, Hank Zipser  is going to be ten years old.  It never ceases to amaze me  that I walk out of there  and I had no idea of walking in.  Had nothing when you first walked in.  That's pretty cool.  Absolutely.  Yeah, yeah.  So bullet points,  I think, is a brilliant idea.  Oh, gee.  I think it is a brilliant idea  that you write it down  so that you don't forget  and you'll be surprised. 
[02:33:00]  You will feel a little differently  two weeks later  and you'll fill them in  and then you'll come up  with more bullet points.  You give yourself,  if you want to write out there,  if the listeners are thinking  about writing  five minutes a day,  longhand, computer,  talk it into your computer.  There's now voice recognition  that pretty much works  except for my Siri.  I don't know what the hell she's saying.  Five minutes a day 
[02:33:30]  and you will be shocked  at what you will end up with.  And how do you handle the moments  when you get the block?  Because I'm sure there are days  where you get in there  and you both just go,  okay.  Will you sometimes just talk  about other things  until it circles back?  We talk about the kids.  We talk about,  you know,  we made Here Comes the Boom  a year and a half ago  in Boston.  So it took a long time  to come out  and I'm very proud  of that movie.  But we'll talk about 
[02:34:00]  the making of the movie.  We'll talk about what happened.  We'll talk about  my youngest son, Max,  is now directing  The New Normal.  Oh, yeah.  You know, this young kid  has gotten, you know,  he's broken into  directing television.  My oldest son  has this phenomenal daughter  with his wife, India Bell.  My daughter stopped teaching.  So, and she's,  she's got three sons.  Lynn has three sons.  And then you ease  into the process.  Right.  Maybe something someone says 
[02:34:30]  kind of sparks an idea  about the character.  Exactly right.  Okay.  Here Comes the Boom.  What do you play in that?  I play a music teacher.  It's really a wonderful,  it's an emotional movie,  a funny movie.  Kevin James is physically  a panther.  He lost 70 pounds.  It is about,  I'm a music teacher  and they're cutting my job.  They're cutting the program.  And out of the blue,  this slacker teacher,  Kevin James,  says, you know what?  I'm going to save your program. 
[02:35:00]  He has no idea how.  And he watches a UFC fight  and realizes if you lose,  you get $10,000.  And he becomes a UFC fighter  and I'm his corner man  who constantly forgets the stool.  And it's funny.  Selma Hayek is beautiful.  Kevin is physically,  he's a physical comedian.  And you really cheer.  I've sat in the audience  where the audience  is yelling at the screen 
[02:35:30]  because the fights  are so incredibly choreographed.  I saw a promotion  on UFC Dana  and then they sent  all the fighters.  Dana's very excited about this.  He loves this one.  He's actually promoting it  on Twitter  and he sent the fighters  in the house  to watch the movie.  And they loved it.  The real fighters came  and a lot of them  are in the movie.  Now these guys,  first of all,  they are gigantic.  I mean like  an apartment building.  Yeah, we've had them all in.  Who's in the movie?  Do you know offhand?  Who's in the movie?  Uzu. 
[02:36:00]  Who won the,  I think he won the gold medal  in jujitsu.  Okay.  From Japan.  He's pretty much  as wide as his country.  Really?  Yeah.  And he doesn't breathe  unless he,  they don't use any energy  unless they need to.  They are zen gentlemen  outside of the ring.  I mean,  the guy Kristoff,  the last fighter  that Kevin James meets,  is this mean  mother of a guy  in life. 
[02:36:30]  So gentle.  Most beautiful wife  you've ever seen.  And he runs around that ring,  jumps off the fence,  flies through the air  and smacks Kevin James  in the mouth.  They are zen gentlemen  outside that ring.  Are you mean?  Huh?  Are you mean?  You know what?  When you're not being zen?  I'll tell you what I mean.  What gets you mean?  What gets you mean?  Disrespect.  Disrespect.  Oh boy.  People who are disrespectful. 
[02:37:00]  People who dismiss me.  Does that happen to you though?  Oh my God.  There are some actors  I have met  who, you know,  think that they are better  or they want to get you  before you.  They think you're going  to get them  and I'm telling you  I can go from zero  to a thousand  in 60 seconds.  I like that.  But who would write  I can't picture that  happening anytime,  you know,  maybe when they didn't know you  but  Do you name names or no?  No, I don't name names.  Fair enough.  What type of an incident 
[02:37:30]  has happened though?  Like where you show up  on a set and a guy  while you were on TV  Not even in a set  in a restaurant.  In a restaurant.  Completely  the man comes up  his wife comes up  says hello  he walks right by the table  doesn't even give me  the time of day.  Won't even wave  won't say hello  and it's not like  you know,  he's solving world peace.  He's going to the door.  Right.  Makes me crazy.  I'm not kidding.  I could eat his shoes up. 
[02:38:00]  And you knew  he was being rude  not respectful  by leaving you alone.  He was being like  you knew what he was doing.  You know.  Yeah.  You know.  You know.  Jimmy knows.  That makes me crazy  because I would never  think to do that  to another human being.  Right.  It's just a high.  I would never  I would never  treat someone like that.  I don't care  who they are  or what they do.  Right.  Wow.  What do you find  that are do movie  because certain movie  actors get very  odd about TV 
[02:38:30]  like they forget  that TV is a  legitimate medium.  Absolutely.  Well the line  is less blurred now.  It used to be  that if you were  in the movies  you did not do television  and if you did television  people resented  that you went  to the movies.  and now work  is so difficult  for everybody.  There are so many men  my age sitting at home  waiting for that phone  to ring  and you've got  to go out  and you've got  to mind the system  and work is work  and you do it.  I did a show  four years ago 
[02:39:00]  it was a webisode  it was called  Children's Hospital  no one knew  this year  it's on television  it won the Emmy  for the best  short form comedy  on television  how about that?  You don't know  until you do it.  Right.  You don't know  what's going to  turn to gold  you just get out there  and you just  keep doing it.  Right.  That's a smart way  to look at it  because a lot of guys  discount things  because they don't  think that they're  big enough to do. 
[02:39:30]  You know what  a lot of people  will not audition  because  they know my work  they've seen my work  if they don't know  who I am now  you know  well just screw them  and I want to tell you  something  I would go into a room  I sit in those  metal chairs  I wait to meet  the producers  and the young actors  say what are you  doing here?  I said I'm looking  for work  you?  You know?  Because that's  just the way it is.  Wow.  Do you know  I went on an audition  recently I had to do 
[02:40:00]  a read for a director  and I saw  Dominic  I don't know  how it says  his last name  Chianisi  Uncle Junior  from the Supergirls  he was on  The Good Wife  last night  as a matter of fact  he was the judge  on The Good Wife  he was auditioning  him and Joe Pantaleon  yes  they were talking  in the room  Pants  Joey Pants  yeah yeah  they both went in  and read  I'm like  these guys  have to read  at this  you bet  you know why  I believe  that the people  now making  the decisions  are young  they are very young  and there's nothing  wrong with that  they're at the beginning  and so they're 
[02:40:30]  scared  and they've got  to see  in front  of their eyes  really  what can you do  because they don't  want to make a decision  on their instinct  alone  which is the way  that I live  my entire life  right  you know  and that's what it is  a lot of it comes out  of not wanting  to put your ass  on  can I say that  oh sure  you can't put your  tush  off them tish  that's Yiddish  for putting your  tushy  on the table  they don't 
[02:41:00]  they don't want to risk  yeah  they don't want to risk  getting in trouble  yes  how do they treat you  when you go to these  they have to treat you  like royalty though  well you know what  they're very warm  it's really true  I get a cookie  but the fact is  if they don't think  I'm right  I take the cookie  in a little napkin  and go home  I eat it in the car  on the way  let me tell you  oh there's been times  when you know  I don't get to finish it  in the office  that's for sure  oh wow  to change topics  a little bit  do you hang out  with the gang  from Happy Days  still here and there  yes I do 
[02:41:30]  I just spoke  to Marion  I just spoke  to Ron  as a matter of fact  a few days ago  Ron is as nice  as you are  well I think  you're a little nicer  Ron's nice though  Ron's very nice  but you're the nicest  man alive  you know what Ron is  you know what Ron is  Ron is wise  Ron is 10 years  younger than I am  I met him  when he was 18  and I think  I've told this story  before  where on  like one of the  very first days  we're on the set  of Happy Days  and I'm reading 
[02:42:00]  the script  I'm from New York  I trained at Yale  I'm a New York actor  and I go  I can't do this joke  and I start  hitting the script  because I'm really  you know  like outraged  young Ron  18 years old  comes up  puts his arm around me  walks me to the back  of stage 27  at Paramount  lot  he said  you know  the writers  are working  as hard  as they possibly 
[02:42:30]  can  let's not  hit the script  and I said  Ron  I will never  hit my script  again as long  as I live  and that was  the beginning  of our  relationship  and he is like  family  but he  and I'm telling you  he wasn't  presumptuous  he wasn't  giving me a lesson  his wisdom  poured out of him  like a river  and I went 
[02:43:00]  it makes sense  never doing it again  and do you  do you get it  like you know  we all know  that right now  Erin Moran  is having a hard time  a hard time  and I've only met her  once and she was  super sweet  and really nice  oh she's a dear  young lady  and what  does anybody  from the show  in touch with her  or what's happening  or is there a possibility  to help her out  it is  the common view  that Erin  it has to come  from within  her own power 
[02:43:30]  right  that  you cannot  take care  of  of someone  unless  they are  willing  to meet you  and maybe  she's not ready  yet  I'm telling you  her core  her center  who she is  as a person  is so  alive  and  it's so sad  I don't know  what to do  it's hard to watch  right  somebody that you  you work with  it's hard to watch 
[02:44:00]  it's hard to watch  yes  and  I  I  we've  we've talked  about  I've talked  to each  member of the  cast  and everybody  their heart  soars  for her  yeah  it's a tough  situation  they have to  want to  help themselves  yes  right  because otherwise  what are you  going to do  you help  you help  for a second  and then they're 
[02:44:30]  back at the  starting line  and then you  help  you help  for a second  and then they're  back at the  starting line  and until  they really  want to  and then  she has  our support  now  she will  have our  support then  when she's  ready  yeah  it's also  because a lot  of  you know  whenever this  is such a  successful show  some people  go on to  continually work  and other  times people  get typecast  or people  are afraid  it's really  weird when a  show ends  but you know  what we all 
[02:45:00]  get typecast  and here's  the deal  and this is  I think this  is probably  true across  the board  you don't  wait for  somebody else  to give  you work  you  my  my expression  is I  take my  pick  I take  my shovel  and I  go to work  every day  and I  mine the  system  I am  not waiting  by that  phone  anymore  I'm  going to  figure it  out  I'm  walking  down the  street  when I  was here  in New  York  right out  of graduate  school  and I  heard somebody  say wow  they're making  this low  low budget  movie  and Richard 
[02:45:30]  Gere was  just let  go  and I  called my  agent  and I  got in  and I  improvised  and I  got the  audition  and I  was in  the Lords  of Flatbush  wow  but you  hear the  information  and then you  act on that  information  and you  make it  happen  and that  was your  second  I made  a movie  called  Crazy Joe  with Peter  Boyle  wait a minute  I might have  had that  actually  it was an  Italian movie  with an  Italian director  I swear to  god  this has 
[02:46:00]  never happened  before  I go into  the audition  with  Giuliani  I don't  know his  name  so I  walked in  my  tush  barely  hit the  chair  I  sit  down  I  say  hello  thank  you  no  no  no  my  name  is  thank  you  I  say  okay  you  don't  want  should  I  read  thank  you  I  go home  I 
[02:46:30]  get a  call  later  in the  afternoon  come in  for a  fitting  I  went  yeah  right  okay  I  hung  up  they  called  me  back  they  said  no  no  no  you  got  the  part  it's  10  weeks  work  you're  going  to be  Peter  Boyle's  driver  I  said  no  wait  a  minute  all  he  said  to me  was  thank  you  I  didn't  say  I  didn't  even  get  my  full  name  out  he  said  no  he  liked  the  way  you  look  he  looked  too  so  when  you  did  Lords 
[02:47:00]  of  Flatbush  who  was  Stallone  in  that  Stallone  Perry  King  who was  at Yale  at the  same  time  he  was  an  undergraduate  and I  was  in  the  drama  school  and  Paul  Mace  bless  his  soul  wonderful  young  Paul  Jabara  bless  his  soul  great  musician  and  actor  and  he  died  also  that  was  74  I'm  guessing  yes  yeah  it came  out  in  May  of  74  and  I  got  the  Fonz  in  December  of  73  wow 
[02:47:30]  so  you  had  that  before  the  movie  came  out  yeah  I  had  it  yeah  is  that  why  you  were  afraid  of being  typecast  for  Grease  too  because  you  I  the  singing  and  dancing  didn't  thrill  you  at  all  for  even  considering  Grease  no  because  I  am  a  dancer  at  Yale  one 
[02:48:00]  of  the  lead  ballerinas  for  the  Alvin  Ailey  group  Carmen  de  Lavalad  was  my  teacher  this  woman  was  like  a  fell  out  of  the  heaven  and  she  was  my  teacher  and  so  I  could  dance  we  saw  you  do  the  dance  on  happy  day  in  the  Weezer  video  the  dance  on  happy  days  the  Russian  Kazatsky  in  the  sixth  grade  my  parents 
[02:48:30]  took  me  to  Madison  Square  Garden  and  I  saw  the  Moseev  folk  ballet  and  I  was  out  of  my  mind  these  men  jumping  all  over  it  was  incredible  then  I  took  Ron  Howard  to  Las  Vegas  of  all  places  to  see  the  Moseev  they  were  appearing  I  think  it's  Caesar's  Palace  and  I  took  Ron  Howard  I  said  Ron  trust  me  come  with  me  this  is  the  greatest  thing  you'll  ever  see  and  then  we  put it  into  the  show  no 
[02:49:00]  kidding  is  that  how  I  you  in  Natalie  would  in  in  West  Side  Story  Travolta  did  sing  in  Greece  it's  been  done 
[02:49:30]  they  put  a  voice  in  for  you  so  I  thought  that  would  be  all  right  I  just  thought  well  I  did  the  Fonz  but  in  I  sang  for  the  very  first  time  in  my  life  in  here  comes  the  boom  I'm  the  music  teacher  and  I  borrow  somebody's  guitar  at  the  airport  and  this  man  teaches  me  to  play  the  guitar  teaches  me  the  song  how to  learn  how to  play  the  guitar  I  didn't  I 
[02:50:00]  don't  think  there  is  one  note  that  I  play  on  that  guitar  that  is  correct  they  just  want  it  to  look  good  right  look  like  you  can  play  I  fooled  myself  it  looks  like  you're  really  playing  it  does  oh  that's  great  it  does  and  somebody  actually  came  over  and was  showing  you  how to  hold  the  guitar  and how  this  is  how  it's  played  but  they  didn't  really  care  how  you  sounded  a young  man  named  Dan  that's  wow  what are  you doing  on Broadway  too  I know  you have  something  on Broadway  did you talk  about that  already  I don't  think  you did  now  how  great  is  this  I  am  living  you  better  be  careful  what  you  wish  for 
[02:50:30]  right  I  opened  in the  movie  on  October  12th  right  which  was  just  this  past  Friday  on  here  comes  the  boom  one  month  later  I  open  on  Broadway  in a  brand  new  comedy  called  The  Performers  okay  two  wonderful  couples  one  couple  the  man  is a  reporter  and his  fiance  the  other  couple  are  porn  stars  and  they  meet  on

[03:02:00]  and they just  behave better  yes  he's actually  helpful punches  me and Jimmy  just took a  leak next to  Bruno Mars  that's what we  do  was he in the  bathroom  got a big  cuck  yeah he was in  the bathroom  he was in  the stall  while me and  you were  having a little  chit chat  about Henry  Winkler  taking a  shit or  was he shy  was he  dropping a  deuce  no he was  taking a  leak in  the stall  shit or  shy  he has  12 million  twitter followers  he's ridiculously  famous  Bruno Mars  is very famous  why  because what  I do  I go in  the bathroom  with Jimmy  and there's  four stalls  and Jimmy 
[03:02:30]  goes all the  way on the  left I go  all the way  on the right  and then you  see who  has to pee  next to you  and the guy  move is to  go to the  stall at that  point  you always  need the  buffer  I'll still  go to the  urinal  he's always  trying to  see my  pecker  why is he  doing that  he's always  trying to  look at my  pecker  I've seen  your pecker  good one  chip  nailed him  I used to  like going  into the  bathroom  at the  old  building  and Jim  would be  at one  of the  urinals  and his  pants  would be  completely  down to  his ankle  he's not 
[03:03:00]  allowed to do  that  this is  really like  a public  bathroom  around here  I forgot  about that  because it  was kind  of a  private  bathroom  for just  Jimmy would  pull his  pants down  to his  ankles  or I would  pee under  the stall  thing  I forgot  about that  bathroom  in the  hallway  or if  everybody  was going  to the  bathroom  and he  gets in  there first  and then  you open  the door  to walk  in the  bathroom  he'd be  pants down  to his  ankles  bent over  spreading  his ass  so he'd 
[03:03:30]  walk right  into his  ass  waiting for  someone to  come in  or he  would  pee  like  four feet  from the  urinal  there's  another  one  Bruno Mars  is short  very short  was he wearing  a hat  oh I did  see him  was it a  fedora  wait you  didn't take  the picture  hipster hat  I'm going to  do it at  10  he's very  famous  he is  short  anyway  you want  the letter  to Miguel  I didn't  forget  dude  this was

[03:14:00]  that senior  citizen  discount  at the  store  though  that was  for purchase  Sam Roberts  that one  was a turkey  that was  good  right  that was  for purchase  no  that last  one was  very very  bad  I remember  the money  that came  rolling it  oh that's  right  we did it  for the love  oh yeah  that was it  we did it  for the love  all for the  love  Jim went to  go get his  photo with  Bruno Mars  even though  he doesn't  know any  of his  songs  he didn't  even know  who he  was 
[03:14:30]  he's probably  still pissed  off about  not getting  a photo  with Randy  he didn't  get a Moesha  no but he  didn't know  who she  was either  he just  loves famous  people  he loves  him so much  he loves  famous people  loves it  like even if  he doesn't  know who  they are  as long as  other people  know who  they are  like did  you see  he was  all excited  when he  found out  he had  12 million  followers  Bruno Mars  right  he's like  he's like  I don't know  and then he  goes oh he's  got 12 million  twitter followers  and his eyes  lit up  right  you'd think  after getting 
[03:15:00]  Ali he'd be  like I'm  done with  this  right  how do we  know who  cares about  Moesha at  that point  I've reached  the pinnacle  yeah yeah  like in 10  years he's gonna  be like remember  Bruno Mars  and they'll be  like nope  nope  don't remember  him  don't recall  Romney said  he enjoyed  himself at  the last  debate  oh  that he did  I don't want  my president  enjoying anything  he was winning  winning  no man I want  them just  fucking  working for  me that  the whole  fucking  time  what does  that mean  he's actually 
[03:15:30]  enjoying himself  I don't think  he's taking it  too seriously  oh  gonna have to  reconsider my  vote I'm  thinking  I love how  Obama's like  like running  on his record  and and his  foreign policy  consists of  one thing  which is  you know the  Osama bin Laden  which you could  say is a big  deal but it  wasn't him  single-handedly  doing anything  but again  regardless  like there's a  bunch of  problems in  the Middle  East  problems with  Iran and  Israel but  his foreign 
[03:16:00]  policy is  just that  thing his  record on  employment  is the  October numbers  seem to have  gone up  that's his  entire record  on on  employment and  getting jobs  it's just  he's picking  and choosing  this one  thing at a  time and  throwing it  out there  like hey  give me  another four  years  I think  not  I think  he's ready  I think  not 
[03:16:30]  he's had  four years  of practice  and now  it's time  he had  his warm  up  and now  he's ready  to play  the game  oh yeah  he's  tired of  him  give him  the rock  we go  home  that stupid  station CD  from the old  days fucked  us up  I'm sorry  really fucked  up the energy  that was like  a weird  October from  the past  yeah  oh by the  way the  the opsters  latest attempt  at a viral  video is up  oh yeah  oh I saw  that that's  funny man  that guy's  fucking  I see him 
[03:17:00]  a lot  that's the  first time  I talked  to him  I usually  see him  marching  up  72nd  street  with an  American  flag  his laugh  is great  yeah  he laughs  with gusto  I don't  usually do  this go  to the  comments  because  there's  a guy  he's  very mad  at what  go down  goofing  on a vet  yeah  how do  you know  he's a vet  you idiot  yeah  oh did  he remove  his comment  is he like  fucking  like take care  of animals  or something  yeah  you sound  like 
[03:17:30]  I don't  know where  it is  maybe  maybe he  got rid  of his  comment  what  happened  what  happened  I see a picture  of Bruno Mars  you don't know  no he was  how old is he  he's young  huh  what's your  question  he wasn't  on  oh boy  Disney  or something  was he  oh he might  have been  one of those  guys  I don't  think so  why  he could  be one  of those  Disney  guys  I interviewed  a kid  that reminded  me of him  yeah he was  a Disney  guy  but it might  not have  been him  I don't  think he  was  I don't  think he  was  yeah 
[03:18:00]  that's him  yeah  he was a  Disney  guy  Sam  no no no  that guy  I remember  that wasn't  Bruno Mars  who was it  you interviewed  he was  Bruno Mars  was famous  even when you  interviewed  that kid  oh then  he's not  that kid  he's just  my latest  attempt at  the viral  video  is illegal  not legal  on the old  YouTube channel  OP radio  yeah this guy  is a hoot  well he  wants the  whole world  to know  that illegal  not legal 
[03:18:30]  illegal  means  not legal  and then he  gives examples  of touching  kids  and buying  and being  just a dopey  kid outside  of fucking  7-11  and trying  to get an  old guy  trying to get  somebody  to buy  you beer  and stuff  that's not  good  and if you  buy the  beer  and stuff  it's illegal  illegal  and illegal  means  not legal  some people  don't seem  to get that  right  so  I thought 
[03:19:00]  it was a lot  deeper than  that  but it isn't  no it's pretty  much what it is  yeah I thought  his illegal  is not legal  even though  it was something  else like maybe  a law that was  passed that wasn't  no he's just  saying if you  do things that  are illegal  that's not  legal  yeah the sign  says it all  illegal  is not  legal  you know  the rest  of the story  yeah see  he's right  though  can you play a little  of the all  he is right  now we gotta  play the examples  it does  yeah yeah  his examples  are great  illegal  what's illegal 
[03:19:30]  against the law  against the law  is not legal  is not legal  I give you an example  I give you an example  okay  kid comes up  mister mister  buy me six  packs of cigarettes  right  here's fifty dollars  buy me a bottle  of rum and a pint  of scotch  and keep the change  right  that's illegal  why is that illegal  because I'm  contributing to  illegal activity  to minors  that shouldn't be  smoking and shouldn't  be drinking alcohol  very simple 
[03:20:00]  illegal  is not legal  well that's deep  the little girl  the little guy  is over there  and this old man  goes up and starts  filling them up  that's illegal  that's disgusting  yeah  well it's illegal  of course  I think we all  know that though  but we don't  abide by that  true  that's what we have  to get back into  just basic  common sense  stay within the  guidelines  and that's why 
[03:20:30]  we got to vote  for Obama  well  my theory is  it don't matter  who I vote for  they're going to  give me who  they want to give  me  let me get the  sign again  legal  or illegal  is not legal  hey hey hey  rude  see what I mean  people have turned  just one way  me  and me only  and you don't  count  he makes a good 
[03:21:00]  point though  he does  because illegal  is not legal  illegal  is not  illegal  not legal  right  I thought his  whole take was  going to be like  laws aren't good  like like like  laws are  should be illegal  no  like the act  of making something  illegal isn't legal  but no he's just  saying when you  commit crimes  that's illegal  he's right  and it's not  legal 
[03:21:30]  which is the  same thing  right  yeah  yeah  except most  people are like  well this is  illegal but  it's not against  the law  and he's there  to be like  incorrect  that is an  incorrect assumption  right  illegal  not legal  who is right  me or Kenny  about Bruno Mars  oh  you are of course  yes  by the way  the fucking  Taliban  may have  finally  fucking  pushed people  over the edge  by shooting  this 14 year  old girl  in the head  oh yeah  fucking  piece of shit 
[03:22:00]  radicals  she was  an outspoken  critic  like  and she had  blogged about it  it's an amazing story  or written something  they don't give a shit  no no  but they put her  there was death threats  against her  14 years old  so her parents  were sending her  to school  without a uniform  like anything  to like  not make her  recognizable  they pulled over  the school bus  they pulled her  out of the bus  and shot her  in the head  holy fuck  and she's alive  I think  yeah she is alive  but there's  thousands of people  rallying in  fucking Karachi  Pakistan  in Afghanistan 
[03:22:30]  this may be  the final  sometimes  you do  one thing  and people  are just like  enough  that's it  it's fucking  shitty  it's a huge story  and by the way  the fucking people  in the subway  defending  Islam  there's a great ad  which says  if you have to fight  civilized men  or savages  stick with civilized  fight jihad  they don't once  mention Islam  they don't once  mention Muslims  they're talking about  people who are for jihad  are savages  and they are  not all Muslims 
[03:23:00]  but  I think I said this  already  but Muslims complain  that you lump  everybody into one category  so when you break it down  to those people  just doing jihad  they get mad at that too  it'll be interesting  how this story plays out  it's a biggie  it really is a big one  yeah  alright  we'll have more on that  tomorrow certainly  we should go home  because it's Monday  he falls quick dude  it's just  it's just amazing  I can watch that guy  just falling off  of that thing  the spaceman jumping  I did something like that once  yeah  no  you didn't  chip 
[03:23:30]  did you  you didn't  30,000 feet  30,000 feet  you found that  that far  fucking balloons  I wish you'd landed  on your head  it was a balloon  yeah I wish you would  have landed on your  fucking head  oh good one  Marion  I miss Marion  oh yeah  she called the show  a couple days in a row  and we were too busy for her  yeah  have her try to call tomorrow  she won't call back now  illegal  I'm not gonna call back  not legal  not legal  this  Saturday  Vegas  Sirius XR  hey hey hey 
[03:24:00]  and now  the Opie and Anthony show  continues  this is  after ONA live  here's your host  Sam Roberts  here we go  wow  you're still in here  Ant  wow  slowly walking away  amazing  everyone stay tuned  for the magic  of Sam Roberts  thank you everybody  did you all hear that 
[03:24:30]  it's after Opie and Anthony live  a ringing endorsement  from Anthony Cumia  and I would like to say  something we didn't mention  on the show today  but something everybody  has been wondering about  yes  we made it  I guess to phase  two  we made it to phase two  on Dish Nation's  Facebook page  which was  they shut down  their public wall  they never shut down  their Facebook page  altogether  and they still  left their comments  open on their own posts  but 
[03:25:00]  to my knowledge  we did indeed  make it to phase two  so congratulations  to everybody  on getting everywhere  anywhere  because  the tough part  about doing  Dish Nation  for today's October  in terms of  the interactivity  that you fans  like to do  which is  attacking them  without being solicited  the thing that makes it  difficult  is they're a TV show  so it's not like  there's  it's a radio show  that's happening now  as we speak  and there's  you know  a producer  or an intern  that's sitting there  watching the Facebook  ready to shut it down 
[03:25:30]  to TV shows  so they're not used  to having  morning traffic  anyway  like all the radio shows  they got people  looking at their  Facebook pages  because they post  their little questions  of the day  and you know  little topics  that they're talking  about every morning  they have to have  the pictures  of the funny breakfast  that they brought  to work today  and all those things  the TV show  it doesn't have any of it  so it might be hours  before they realize  the horrible damage  that's been done  to their Facebook  but that's not taking  anything away  from any of you today 
[03:26:00]  let's play  what did you learn  call up  866-WOW1-WOW  866-969-1969  how about you  intern Anthony  what did you learn  on today's show  Sal you can go  answer the phones  what did I learn  on today's show  that's what I asked you  don't start repeating  I always loved  Henry Winkler  you always loved  Henry Winkler  he was great  that's not something  you learned  I assured my love  for him  that's not something 
[03:26:30]  you learned  I did  you didn't listen  to the show  today did you  you didn't listen  there's a lot of  work to be done  like what  when the burden  what did you do  what were you doing  like what  don't tell me  splicing  splicing  yes  Eric were you  having the interns  splice today  no I think Troy was  was having them splice  he was having  he was having  I don't know  no  with tape  maybe not with tape  what were you splicing today  there was a lot of stuff  that is needed to be done  I love that Troy 
[03:27:00]  that Eric didn't even  pick up on that  he was like  no but I think  Troy was having  a splice today  yes yes  what were you splicing  I'm looking for  for some stuff  for Troy  which is what  don't go to  Eric's vagary school  it's something  that he's looking  to produce  to produce a bid  I don't know  if I can give away  bits here  I don't want to  of course you can  no I can't do that  oh my god  you are the worst  this is what Anthony  was talking about  Anthony Cumia  he was talking about  how bad you are  exactly  right  if that's what  he was saying 
[03:27:30]  I mean you come on  you talk about splicing  and then you won't  say what you did  you just say  oh I had a lot to do  well I don't  I don't know  what's to be said  and what's not to be said  just answer the questions  I was editing  something for Troy  oh god  I don't know  what Eric teaches  all you  these nagel vagaries  that come out of  I don't understand  you don't hear it  on any other radio show  when you listen  to other radio shows  and people get asked  questions  they just give you  the answer  they don't go  well I was  I was doing something  and I was very busy  because there was a lot 
[03:28:00]  that had to be  my god  that's not a good  enough answer  it's a terrible answer  alright  it is a horrible answer  I mean  do you think  that's a good answer  I think it's  an appropriate answer  it's terrible  I appreciate him  giving that answer  though  it's a terrible answer  I'm in the middle  of working on something  I don't want  I don't want to  I don't want to blow it  and it may not  even make the air  so it's  why even talk about it  it's a horrible answer  though  to just be like  I was splicing  I had a lot to do 
[03:28:30]  what did you have to do  I was splicing something  well splicing  first of all  is a term  it doesn't make any sense  well I'm a film major  so I use splicing a lot  that's usually my  I'm sorry Mr. Film Major  we don't all have the education  nobody even really works  on film anymore  no of course not  but still  you call it on the editing room floor  you call it splicing  editing room floor  you just get a laptop  editing room floor  is what doesn't make the  right  but when you're sitting there  and you're doing  you're splicing up  you're splicing video  I don't know if that's the case at all 
[03:29:00]  I think  I think what's going to happen  is you're going to graduate school  and get some film job  and you're going to be like  oh what needs to be spliced together  and they're going to look at you  like who hired the asshole  like  there's options for splicing  on the menu  there isn't  yes there is  he's doing a good job for me  he is  yeah he's doing a good job for me  I mean I can take your word for it  I mean he's way better than  what that other fucking asshole  because you know  these interns  they come in here  and they blow steam up my ass  all day long  no I know  so you understand my perspective  right  of seeing this asshole come in  what did you learn today on the show  why I didn't listen to anything on the show 
[03:29:30]  oh what were you doing  there's a lot to be done  well what specifically  I was splicing for Troy  no no no  he's combing through a lot of audio for me  alright  he's looking for very specific things  so he's listening very closely  so  you see how much better that answer is  I couldn't get it that quick  he didn't want to blow it  but you didn't blow it  and you gave me a much more suitable answer  right  but then I said that I'm looking through stuff for Troy  and he's probably also worried about  stepping over what I'm asking him to do  and saying something he shouldn't say  but he could have said 
[03:30:00]  I have a lot of shows that I'm combing through  because Troy wants some very specific stuff  now I could have said that  you could have said it before  what gives it away  oh Troy's working on something that's very specific  I can't wait  I didn't think of it until now  that it was already said  you don't use your brain  that's the problem  I wasn't using it at that point  he's good  I like Anthony  you do  I do  is it just around me that he gets all nervous then  possibly  I don't know  he's driving me the wrong way today  really  yeah  I'm giving him a lot of shit to do  and he's handling his business  he is 
[03:30:30]  so I'm okay with him  yeah yeah  alright I mean I can take your word for it  because you give it to me straight Troy  yeah  I've always respected your word  and if he was acting like a jerk off  I'd come in and tell you he's being a jerk off  you've done it before with other interns  of course  there's nothing that would stop you  he's kind of acting like a jerk off on the air  I don't think he  I think he's just afraid of what exactly to say  what's appropriate to say  what's not to say  he's still all shaken up about him  almost breaking up with his girlfriend  because  oh no  because he got in trouble  did you hear about that  of course  yeah  I replayed the whole thing on Sunday  yeah dude  I don't know what's up with that 
[03:31:00]  yes I did  you did not  yes I did  I was at Comic Con  so I didn't do a live show  and so I replayed the after shows  oh boy  with the Friday  and then the follow up on the Tuesday  how are things with you and your girlfriend  well we were at Comic Con  so we're okay  you're okay  yes  we're doing pretty good  she hasn't broken up with you again  and then you've gone groveling back  no it was the other way around  but yeah  but everything's good  you broke up with her  and she came groveling back  it was an agreement  there was something to be said  you see what I mean about the vagaries  I don't know how Nagel teaches them to communicate  because if I was  if I just got into a big brawl 
[03:31:30]  with  you fought your girlfriend  if I just got into a big argument with her  I'm not gonna come on  and get back  and dig back in  I don't even know what you're talking about  do you have any idea what he's saying Troy  I zoned out  Jim walked in the room  and I go  oh Jim's here  exactly  this is what I mean about him  maybe he does good work for you  but he's a pain in my ass  he just needs to learn  how to open up a little bit  but I did open up  and I got into shit with her  so what  maybe if she can't handle you being honest 
[03:32:00]  she's not the right girl for you  you know what that means  you gotta keep your bitch in check  yeah  you need to tell her  this is what's up  this is what's going on  deal with it  bitch  say bitch too  no I can't see that  yeah you like that ship  that's right  call her a fucking cunt  I can't do that  I mean that's kind of taking it over  over the  that's the way it's gonna be  cunto  that's taking it over  why it's a good taste  that's a shit  well don't do it in here  look at this one  he's just happy about it  he knows the deuce  that's about to come out 
[03:32:30]  um  Luke in Massachusetts  hey I learned that uh  Henry Winkler is to blame  for uh  John Travolta's success  and if he had taken that part  we wouldn't have to deal  with that asshole now  that's true  that's true  I mean  well what would John Travolta  have done  I mean he did  was Saturday Night Fever  before or after Grease  I think it was before  alright so he might  we might have still  have to deal with that asshole  yeah but Grease sent him  to such a plane that  yeah  I wish Henry would have 
[03:33:00]  taken that cause  I mean  we gotta look who's  talking out of it  great  that's true  although  look who's talking  was a fabulous film  there's nothing wrong  with that movie whatsoever  uh  Casey in Los Angeles  Casey  hey good morning  Sam  cutie pie  thank you Casey  good morning to you too  I learned that uh  Jim Norton  likes to get pictures  with celebrities  whether he knows  who they are  or not  a lot of Twitter followers  I tuned in a little late though  he had the uh 
[03:33:30]  I guess Bruno Mars  was in here  doing the morning mashup  and Norton had no idea  who he was  he pissed next to him  he had no clue  who the guy was  until  see the guy in the hat  he's the guy in the hat  exactly  but then you check  those Twitter followers  and he was like  yep  12 million  this one  is gonna be great  for the photo album  um  and that's what I was saying  I figure  I guess it was silly  but like in my own mind  I thought  like once you get Ali  once you get a photo  with Ali  it's kinda like  all these other photos  are no big deal  but I guess that was 
[03:34:00]  silly of me  no that's logical  yeah it is right  uh  Izzo  as in H2  the  you're on  after Opie and Anthony live  yes good morning Sam  good morning  I learned today  that the girl  from the bus video  said that  the bus driver  no I was  well good morning  to you too  good morning  sorry the Ron and Fez  I was talking to her  but you know  good morning to everybody  thank you for that  what were you saying  Izzo  I'm sorry 
[03:34:30]  um  I said that  the girl  from the bus video  said that the punch  from the bus driver  heard it  that's right  it heard it  it looked like a punch  from Mortal Kombat  yes  and um  I had one other thing  I called in earlier  um  with Jim  and the Saturday Night Live  this is the third bit  that Kenan Thompson  has stolen  from uh  the show  I don't know  what's that  what's the first one  the first one  was  I don't know  I think it was back  in February  perhaps  um  when you guys  did Billy the Bassman  right  oh yeah  he did do that character 
[03:35:00]  right  thank you uh  thank you Izzo  that is a weird thing  going on over there  at SNL  because  Kings of Catchphrase Comedy  yeah yeah  because that  that came on like  right after we did  Billy the Bassman  over the top character  right  it was like the same  thing as Billy the Bassman  then last week  they do the Daniel Craig  skit  which is really  similar  to Chip  like  yeah I didn't see  this week's  yeah  you didn't  did you hear it  when we played it  this morning  or were you not in yet  I was in  but yeah  I was still asleep 
[03:35:30]  but you were in  yeah  you were in the office  sleeping  yet Kenan  does this skit  this week  where it's all  based on  that don't make  no sense  but he did that  character before  has he  I think so yeah  you better find  some tape  I'll look it up  you should look it up  I remember him  doing something  similar like that  a while ago  that's a big point  of contention  because I mean  it really seemed  like on this skit  that they did  over the weekend  and by the way  this is the same  SNL that Mr. Andy  Sandberg decided 
[03:36:00]  to do  a brief interview  just as the popularity  of Sam Roberts  one question interview  was skyrocketing  oh yeah  you were  miffed about that  well  I'm saying SNL  has a history  of possibly  ripping off the show  you know  I think they're like  what's the haps  with 30 Rock  yeah but I kind of  take credit  every time anybody  says what's the haps  I don't think  it's legitimate  but yeah  Kenan  like it seemed  like it was just  shoehorned  into the skit  they were doing  some weird  dancing skit  and Kenan  kept going  that don't make 
[03:36:30]  no sense  oh that's  different  yeah I mean  and he did it  especially the second  and the third time  he did it over  and over again  and he really did  sound like Chip  oh I do have  an ET Blu-ray  if you want to  give it away  yeah we can  give that away  let me see if I can  find that  SNL clip  for those that  didn't hear it  because you didn't  hear it Roland  no  so I wanted to  I was tired  from Comic Con  yeah you had  a big weekend  huh  yeah  we'll talk about  that in a minute  this is  you tell me Roland  you're an SNL guy  you tell me  if you think this 
[03:37:00]  is a little bit  too close  okay  this is Kenan  from SNL this week  this is Fossey honey  we don't do  one two threes  we do  kadunks  kadunks  zah zahs  all right  so a kaduk  is a three  that don't make  no sense  okay you people  know who I am  right  you see  it's the exact  same thing  like  oh yeah  because you're  playing a dummy  on this one  like listen  this is later  in the skit 
[03:37:30]  story as I'm  sure  right  we were a  hot item  and for that  one crazy  night  he loved me  with every  bit of his  body except  for his  dong  do you  understand that  I would say  it was hard  on me  but  no really  it just  laid there  like a  steamed  carrot  why'd you  tell that  story  it's a bad  reflection  on you  that don't 
[03:38:00]  make no  sense  okay moving  on  weren't you  guys making  fun of  Tommy Toon  last week  too  Tommy Toon  yeah wasn't  it  you guys  were making  fun of him  I don't even  know why  you're talking  about Tommy  Toon  what does  Tommy Toon  have to do  with this  it might be  during a  commercial break  when somebody  walked by the  window  Jimmy was making  fun of him  that's why  I don't understand  because she said  Tommy Toon  oh she did  yeah so  I thought  no it's like  I think maybe  somebody at  SNL has seen  the chip  YouTube videos  if they're not  listening to the  show  but to do  the guy who 
[03:38:30]  tells bad jokes  and kind of  just takes the  wind out of  everyone's sails  one week and  then the very  next week  Keenan is doing  a that don't  make no sense  skit  that's like  that's ridiculous  that's way too  close and it's  not like SNL  over the past few  years has been  known for original  ideas they haven't  exactly been on  fire and on top  of things lately  on Tuesday they  write all night  long until the  next day  so maybe at  one point where  you listen to it  I think I got an  idea  it happens  yeah I get  but yeah  apparently it  happens quite  often over there 
[03:39:00]  yeah well it's  like one in the  morning and  Wednesdays the  table read  you gotta  I should hire  people who  are like know  how to write  comedy then  I know  that's one  possibility  Tina's gone  Tina Fey is gone  Tina Fey wouldn't  have ripped off  Jim all the time  um let's see  David in Kansas  City welcome to  After Open Anthony  Live  How you doing  Sam  I just want to  say the most  unbelievable part  about that bus  video is that  woman said she  was on her way  to work  okay  thank you David 
[03:39:30]  did she say  that she's on  her way to  work  Anthony was so  dead on today  though when he  said that uh  because she said  well I was  simply trying to  get on the bus  to find some  change that I  had in my  pocket because I  had exact change  for the fare and  he hit me like  that is the  classic sort of  swindle to get a  free ride on the  bus when I was  going to high  school we used  to have to take  public buses to  school and I  used to try the  trick myself because  I wouldn't have any  money on me but we  had little bus tokens  and you'd be like oh 
[03:40:00]  my bus tokens are in  my bag let me just go  sit down and I'll  take them out  eventually the bus  drivers had to be  like no if your bus  tokens aren't in your  hand right now you're  not getting on this  bus because every time  you just keep looking  through your bag until  you get to school and  then you get off the  bus as quickly as  possible of course you  know it's the same  thing as like oh let  me I gotta go to the  bathroom hang on while  they're checking train  tickets and then what  happens the train stops  and you get off because  you know you're getting  free rides  she also said that the  situation was going to 
[03:40:30]  escalades  it's going to escalades  the situation owns an  escalade I don't know if  that's what she was  referring to she was  watching MTV right before  she got on  Mark you're on after  opening Anthony live  hello Mr. Sam  hello Mr. Mark  what I learned today  was Henry Winkler  repeats the same story  every time he's in  which story was that  right when I turned on  the radio he was he  was saying how how  him and his his co-writer  she sits at the desk  he walks around and he 
[03:41:00]  repeated the exact same  story last time he was  there he did he  explained his process to  us last time although I  thought today's Henry  Winkler thing was  appearance was awesome  because finally we  started to get little  hints of Henry Winkler  getting angry like  that's what I would  love to see like he  said today that he  gets upset when people  dismiss him or when  they disregard him or  whatever and he told  a story about being in  a restaurant and  somebody not saying  hello like I would  imagine that Henry  Winkler after all these 
[03:41:30]  years and all these  people that he's been  nice to he has to have  a short fuse like I'm  sure he has little pet  peeves and nothing  bothers him except for  these little pet peeves  but if you start  dismissing him or if  you start being like  oh that guy fuck him  he's the Fonz he's not  a real actor he's just  going fuck you and  just and just goes  nuts he's got to and  that's what we need to  see next time he's in  here I would encourage  Obi Anthony and Jim to  just start poking at him  a little bit it's like  what you can do dark 
[03:42:00]  Mark Birbiglia dark Mark  Birbiglia Mike Birbiglia  when he gets real pissed  when Voss gets him  upset yeah and he's a  different Mike yeah  like I think I think  Henry Winkler would  stab somebody I think  so I think so and he's  had to deal with a lot  while hitting a jukebox  I couldn't believe that  he said he had to  audition he goes on  auditions like that and  then Jim was talking  about how Joey Pants and  the guy who played  Uncle Junior on the 
[03:42:30]  Sopranos that he saw  them auditioning if  you're not Brad Pitt or  Clooney or one of these  A-listers acting is like  the worst job ever  sometimes they have to  audition if they really  want that part George  Clooney has to audition  if he wants a certain  part that the director  doesn't see him fit he'll  audition Jesus but but  they do it like in their  house like I can't  imagine just getting on  that level and still  having to go into a room  and prove yourself to  somebody Henry Winkler  like if anybody doesn't 
[03:43:00]  have to audition it  should be him that  doesn't have to  audition he did happy  days he's done all  these comedy movies he's  done everything  children's hospital  children's hospital like  you know his range of  work you know what he  puts out there I  couldn't just the  psychology of having to  go in and impress  somebody and prove to  somebody that you're  worthy of whatever this  part is just so you can  you know just for a job  it's nuts dude it's nuts  De Niro's the only one  that doesn't have to  audition almost yeah but  De Niro will take any  movie too like De Niro 
[03:43:30]  shows up in machete and  whatever else like you  offer him he's a  Christopher Walken's  yeah I mean De Niro  doesn't exactly do a  level movies anymore the  reason he doesn't have  to audition is because  they don't have auditions  for those movies they  just take what they  could take just what  Tom Hanks says produces  own movies is that  what yeah he does  everything on play tone  and so he doesn't have  to audition because he  casts himself I cast me  yeah were you trying to  talk Eric with the  Henry Winkler thing I  think he was masking  some anger when they  talked to him about  Joanie from Happy Days 
[03:44:00]  we said there's a  consensus that it means  all of them have talked  about you know dealing  with her or whatever  she's probably hit him  up so many times to the  fact that he's like  and he's going how many  times fucking deal with  her anymore how many  times do I have to  fucking drag you out of  this shit Joanie how  many times do I have to  help you how many times  do I have to pull you out  of that motherfucking  trailer park before you  realize Fonz money only  goes so far hey get the  fuck out of here you 
[03:44:30]  think he calls her  shortcake while he's  cursing at her let me  tell you something  shortcake you want to  come to me because you  can't afford food well  what happened to the  extra money I gave you  what happened to the  other fucking money I  gave you snort that up  your nose to asshole  he goes where's where's  Chachi where's Scott  fucking bail no everybody's  knocking on the nice  Fonz's door you can get  the fuck out of here  Joanie because let me  tell you Chachi may love  you but the Fonz does not  Scott Bale's on call  waiting for why she's  calling him beep beep he 
[03:45:00]  needs money too hey  hey Fonz Scott Bale yeah  Charles and George it's  running low buddy I just  got the fuck out of here  Chachi don't fuck with me  right now I'll bet  sometimes he wears his  leather jacket around his  house and just starts  cursing and beating people  up and stuff that'd be  awesome I'll bet he's got  some kind of like  Taekwondo dungeon in his  basement the Fonz did  exactly I'll bet he's  carried on those martial  arts I'll bet he's got  like a like a heavy bag 
[03:45:30]  and match he's got  nunchucks and size and  ninja stars and all this  crazy shit in his  basement he could probably  fight like a motherfucker  because Mr. Miyagi was  his teacher in happy days  right who do you think  would win in a fight  Henry Winkler or what's  his name Rob Macho  okay fine who would win  in a fight Henry Winkler  or Ralph Macho I'll bet  Henry Winkler would beat  the shit out of him  the funny part of the  like the two nice guys  in Hollywood like they  yeah but Ron yeah but  Ralph Macho is like an 
[03:46:00]  actual nice guy and  Henry Winkler is like I'm  Zen I'm Zen just don't  fucking push me I don't  know Ralph Macho is  hitting anger too though  you think so I think they  both do because they're  perceived as such nice  guys what about Ron  Howard versus Henry  Winkler street fight bring  your own weapon probably  Henry Winkler definitely  right and what weapon do  you think he'd bring a  wrench you think he'd just  bring a wrench yeah from  the the garage so to you  because he's Fonzie yeah I  thought you meant because  Henry Winkler just has a 
[03:46:30]  vibe of blunt force trauma  like just a thud is the  sound that you hear he's  working on his motorcycle  he goes hey  how many hands are you for  you what's a more cycle  motorcycle  Keith in Connecticut what did  you learn I learned today  that Fez is still I mean  Opie's still trying to get  Fez panic attacks he has  him walking a couple extra  laps around the building  today he did take another  shot at Fez today and before  I go I just want to say  Danny's still a dick and I  hate him okay he's not here 
[03:47:00]  today but I appreciate you  letting your your feelings be  heard should he win the  blu-ray he hung up already  um yeah I definitely think  that the Fonz has a violent  temper that at any moment  could come out like I think  I think he's like uh like a  Navy SEAL and then he's been  deprogrammed but the minute  he hears a keyword he's right  back into action he becomes a  killing machine that's how I  feel about Henry Winkler he's a 
[03:47:30]  nice guy but you can't trust  him you can't trust him I trust  him but what happens if you're  with a kid and the kid  accidentally says you know  correctamundo correctamundo  what if that's the word or  what happens if you're like oh  Henry Winkle you want to come  over and watch happy days and  he's a nice guy so he'll be  like yeah Roland I'll watch it  with you I'll make a kid's  dream come true and then all  of a sudden Fonz says  correctamundo and next thing  you know you're on the floor  with your throat slit you  don't even know what  happened then what happens 
[03:48:00]  Roland you tweet out Fonz  just stabbed me yeah I don't  think you could tweet with a  slit throat is the only  problem I saw the Fonz I saw  Henry Winkler it's just this  is how nice the guy is this  is the perception that we  have you think Kenny for  getting him water Roland goes  up to him and he goes oh  good morning sir and Henry  Winkler stands up and he  goes good morning what was  your name again and Roland's  wearing his Jets t-shirt and  Roland says Roland and he  goes Roland good morning I'm  sorry I didn't remember that 
[03:48:30]  how are the Jets doing it's  just like that's what he said  dude and yeah pretty good  pretty good pretty good that's  wonderful that's great to hear  he hopes they win there's one  guy one guy who has been  through an Opie and Anthony  interview and he leaves by  saying thank you all for the  wonderful chat he went out  there and said to Kenny thank  you sir for giving me water  he can't give him a bottle of  water and he remembered yeah and  everybody else comes in here and 
[03:49:00]  he's there like oh the water just  appears because I'm famous yeah  not Henry Winkler he takes  nothing for granted I said  avion that's a shitty water but  he's also always watching yeah  nothing for granted but you  know what that means the fact  that he knows what everybody's  doing for him means those eyes  are always open he's homeland he's  that guy who that's who he is  that's scary at one point Henry  Winkler was turned and I don't  know what point and I don't know  when they're finally gonna catch up  with him but I won't sleep until 
[03:49:30]  it happens and I will sleep with  him like Claire Danes did if I  have to if I have to get the  information I will  season one spoiler I'm sorry  Brad and Buffalo  even if it's in the back of a car  role and I'll do it for the  information for the mission hello  Brad hey my what did you learn is  that Roland you are a fucking  psychopath wherever people bring  you it's true blu-ray anytime you  got you want a blue blu-ray Brad  yeah all right you just want et 
[03:50:00]  stay on hold Brad just want an et  because Roland you are complete like  you're a problem yeah I wouldn't have  fun you know what Roland said to me I  was interviewing people first of all I  told you that a couple guys came in  to talk about their new discovery  channel it's the guys from how  stuff works the website and they  also do a podcast and now it's  becoming a TV show they came in to  do an interview because I was doing  comic-con radio all weekend at the  Jacob Javits Center so they came in  to do an interview with me and  Roland was there assisting me 
[03:50:30]  throughout the weekend which is very  nice you Roland big help except for  moments like this when these guys come  into this small room there's like five  people in there and I see across the  table as I'm it's a 15-minute  interview it's nothing Roland is  snoozing Roland is asleep it was Friday  it was a long day ahead here and then I  sit him in the front row I was the  host of the Christopher Lloyd Q&A the  panel I say hey Christopher Lloyd's  here and going to questions and talking  to him and riffing a little bit and 
[03:51:00]  going crazy it was great you crushed  how you did people were laughing well  thank you very much Roland but the  problem with the people laughing was  you were annoyed because they were  waking you up I looked down and in the  front row because I sat Roland in the  front row so he could video it for me in  the front row of the convention hall and  by the way the Christopher Lloyd panel  was probably the most popular other  than maybe Walking Dead was the most  popular one of the most popular panels  at the New York Comic-Con they turned  hundreds of people away because the 
[03:51:30]  room was full people were standing in  the back Roland's got a front row seat  and what happens you're sleeping in the  front row that's Friday I had that they  charged so much for food and drink I had  nothing to keep me like five bucks for  vitamin water fuck you Javits Anthony is  texting and saying Jesus I swear I  understand one-fourth of what Roland says  it's like another language I got I got to  get better I feel like as a broadcaster I  take for granted how well I can  understand what you're saying and then 
[03:52:00]  I have to keep in mind there's many  people who are less familiar with the  show like Anthony Cumia who has no idea  what the fuck you're talking about at any  moment what can you do okay what did you  just say yeah what can you do I think  the translation for that is ah what can  you do yeah correct yeah yeah yeah yeah  did you have a good time at Comic-Con I  had a blast yeah a lot of fun yeah you're  people you're giving me advice before my  interviews you told me one but I forget  which person it was you advised me without 
[03:52:30]  even knowing who I was gonna interview you  said my first question should be why is  your wife fucking someone else oh yeah  Eric you've seen a lot of interviews  done before right how do you think it  would have gone if I'd started the  interview with this person I don't I  honestly don't remember who it was I  remember who was if I had started by  saying so what's it like to have your  wife and it wasn't based on any truths  it was just something Roland thought  would be fun to watch if I had started  by saying so what's it like to have your  wife fucking someone else right now I've  been awkward especially if they didn't  have a wife or yeah it was a female or 
[03:53:00]  the wife is dead and I had sex with  your wife forgot who it was yeah yeah I  remember later I'll bet you won't um  how many interviews did you do a lot of  them yeah I mean because they did a  pop-up channel yeah so it was on 104 all  weekend long I think it's gonna be on  demand too and they threw a lot of on the  fly but yeah yes I did yeah I did  interviews all weekend that's all I was  doing there I didn't really get to  experience it as much as some other  people Roland you got to experience it a  little bit yeah um the other thing 
[03:53:30]  what about you Eric you were at comic-con  yes Jeff fun um sort of why only sort  of that's your shit I don't know if next  year I'm gonna go what that's it that's  your whole way too crowded like there is  so many people there now that that's  almost impossible to get anywhere yeah  but this is your whole place you can buy  things and take pictures with people and  that's all you do I know but when  there's so many people and the lines are  way too long it's just it's not it's  getting to the point where it's not  worth going anymore who did you take 
[03:54:00]  pictures with um wrestling people I got  your photo that you texted me of Virgil  sitting by himself oh yeah that is  gonna go up on low I hope so because as  soon as I walked over there there was a  girl's like eclectic clothing store  right next to his booth all these people  were there nobody near Virgil and there  was one person I walked with Jess and  Roland I walked right by Virgil and there  was one person at the table and I got to  show Jess and Roland Virgil in action  hustling and just trying to get every 
[03:54:30]  dollar did I say 35 it's 40 dollars for  the for the combo 40 dollars for the  belt out yeah he pulled the belt out  after he signed Eric's belt uh you must  hate Virgil I hate him and James you're on  after Opie and Anthony live hey what's  I love Roland it is it is difficult to  understand Roland he's awesome dude he's  awesome I love that guy thank you I have a  blu-ray of Princess Bride if he wants oh  yeah bring it on man stay on hold yeah um I 
[03:55:00]  tell you though Roland learned something  that he was getting frustrated about at  Comic-Con Roland had never been to a  convention before and what Roland didn't  realize was that people wait online or  in line if you're one of those grammar  policing it's a it's a it's a locational  thing it's a geographic thing I say  waiting online what Roland didn't realize  was people wait online for hours to get 
[03:55:30]  autographs people camped out for  Christopher Lloyd yeah I Roland and  Carrie Fisher there was like a massive  line and the kid from uh Harry Potter  right the line doubled back and forth  yeah Draco they uh extended him for two  hours extra Roland didn't realize that  people wait online for hours and then  pay like a hundred dollars yeah to get a  photo and an autograph and I gotta tell  you something Roland was getting  frustrated with some of the people around  here who just go up to him and take the 
[03:56:00]  autograph thing for granted because he  didn't realize that if he told them why  don't you just go to a convention and get  it that they would have to wait online for  hours and pay three figures to get what  they're getting here for free I'm gonna  start showing you people if you want it  you are 50 bucks but you thought you  feel like people take you for granted a  little bit yeah a lot of people think  here's all the stuff I didn't realize  that that was that Kirk Hammett Kirk  Hammett from Metallica yeah I didn't  realize that was a mass-ass line it went  outside and it was the stairs and he said  mass-ass line yes yes um even the stupid 
[03:56:30]  Starbucks line was half hour yeah is  there anybody specific that you think  needs to learn autograph etiquette after  comic-con a group of people a group of  people can you mention any names in this  group I don't mention names you don't  know now will these people become aware  of the situation through your means they  will get an invoice I'll start getting  an invoice so whoever gets an invoice I  want to know right now am I getting an 
[03:57:00]  invoice maybe but I'm good about  autographs you'll see once they come  out no I hope I'm not in trouble I saw  one guy spend like 300 for a he signed a  flux capacitor who Christopher Lloyd did  yeah and then the guy had like the  Marty McFly jack and something else yeah I  just heard 300 something like whoa yeah  it's like a hundred dollars per  signature yeah I didn't know that I  thought like 100 whatever you want no  way dude yeah and you thought how long  did you think people wait online for 
[03:57:30]  well I asked one girl I go how long  have you been here she goes eight  hours how long did you think it was  though I don't know that you just go  there and you wait for maybe 20 30  minutes to just keep on going really  yeah I didn't know that that world  existed for that long I hope you change  your ways I hope you like you start to  get a little more Nazi-ish over the  autographs and the pictures who's that  guy from Star Wars people were he's like  in the one of the emperor you know he's  the one that pulled the lever like for  for the I remember the Star Wars thing 
[03:58:00]  he's one of the Darth Vader's goons  who's Darth Vader Darth Vader oh Darth  Vader goons and the one guy waited two  hours in line for a Darth Vader goon yeah  30 bucks and you're sitting there going  like what is this guy is like an old guy  like taking pictures it must have been I  think it was the emperor yeah  was there yeah Palpatine or whatever  yeah there's another guy he was one of  his goons that uh that Vader choked with  his hand choked choked right yeah like  30 bucks for two hours I'm like Jesus 
[03:58:30]  Christ you can't handle it I was  surprised like wow yeah um people cried  when they when the line shut down they  got no more autographs were done for the  day yeah so I was just crying and what  did you do to console her I laughed  yeah you did right in your face didn't  you nearer yeah but it's kind of funny  though so you really think it's too  crowded for you to go back Eric I loved  it it's it's really getting to be did  you buy any goodies I bought a couple  of things what did you buy I thought I
