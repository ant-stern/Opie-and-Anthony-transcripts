<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a recap of the previous day's show, which featured AC/DC's Brian Johnson and Malcolm McDowell, who unexpectedly revealed a long-standing friendship.  The hosts recounted humorous anecdotes from the encounter, including Johnson's onstage memory lapses and Jim Norton's nervous excitement, documented on video and generating considerable amusement. Norton's post-show acquisition of signed memorabilia, particularly a prized Japanese *A Clockwork Orange* poster, was discussed at length.  The hosts also noted the interest from Warner Brothers and AC/DC's management in obtaining copies of the photos taken during the event.

The show then transitioned to a heated discussion of the Casey Anthony trial, which one host was watching live.  The hosts offered extensive commentary, focusing on Anthony’s demeanor, her boyfriend's testimony, and theories about her daughter's death.  Their commentary was highly critical and laced with offensive language. They also discussed the differing prison environments for men and women.  Bernard Hopkins, a boxer, was announced as a scheduled guest for later in the show.

The next segment delved into two unrelated topics: a graphic discussion of a mother's trial for child murder, including descriptions of the crime scene and morbid speculation about the mother's motives, and a humorous brainstorming session about Dominique Strauss-Kahn's potential escape methods from house arrest.  The hosts explored improbable scenarios involving helicopters, submarines, and bribery.  Other topics touched upon included the American Idol finale (featuring Judas Priest and Steven Tyler), Oprah Winfrey's final show, and Bernard Hopkins' controversial comments about Donovan McNabb.  The segment included two listener calls about GPS tracking devices used on criminal offenders, a Malcolm McDowell voice-over of an insulting message for a producer, and a clip of Oprah's closing remarks.  Tom Papa and Malcolm McDowell were mentioned as guests.

Tom Papa then joined the show, recounting an awkward encounter with Oprah Winfrey involving an ill-fated hug.  This led to a discussion of his experience on Oprah's show, the surprisingly subdued backstage atmosphere, and his pre-show anxieties. The conversation shifted to a negative taxi experience in New York City, prompting a nostalgic discussion about the city's changes.  A digression about an attractive Sirius Satellite Radio intern led to a crude joke and a conversation about body odor. The discussion then turned to Papa's upcoming appearances on *The Marriage Ref*, leading to talk about other guests like Regis Philbin, Bill Maher, Michael Moore, and their respective personalities and political views.  The hosts also discussed various political and social issues including the Iraq War, Libya, Syria, U.S. foreign policy, and the American education system.  Bernard Hopkins was again announced as an upcoming guest.

Bernard Hopkins joined the show, preceded by a discussion involving Tom Papa’s alleged behavior towards waitresses at a comedy club and the impact of a new DJ on the club’s atmosphere.  The hosts also discussed the personalities of other comedians, contrasting their public and private personas, specifically Jerry Seinfeld and Bob Saget. Hopkins then discussed his recent boxing match win, his rigorous training regimen, his opponent's steroid accusations (which he planned to sue over), and his future fight plans.  He also spoke about other boxers like George Foreman and Sugar Ray Robinson, sharing insights into the mental and physical demands of boxing at an advanced age.  Finally, Hopkins shared his opinion on Donovan McNabb's perceived lack of "heart" and the racial implications of expectations placed upon Black athletes.

The final segment featured Hopkins discussing his upcoming fight, his preference for fighting in Canada (despite one host's dislike of Canadians), and his personality. There was humorous banter about boxing gloves, with Hopkins giving a signed glove to Jim Norton.  Tom Papa remained in studio, promoting his show.  The conversation shifted to other boxers, including Michael Vick and Donovan McNabb, and their perceived characteristics. Keith Robinson was mentioned and described as a "fucking lunatic" with surprisingly good people skills. The segment concluded with promotional plugs for Tom Papa's show and more banter about Hopkins' gloves and the hosts' impressions of him.  Significant profanity was used throughout the segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, the father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I worked here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on? Live? No? Is it happening? This is it?  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment  and having very few limits. 
[00:00:30]  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is, like, different than any other radio.  No telling? What are we going to hear in here today?  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's not like radio stuck hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level.  Insane.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people. 
[00:01:00]  Real excitement.  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  We're on already?  Oh, my God.  You got to do it again after yesterday's amazing show?  I don't think we should have to.  That's what I was thinking.  I think we should have taken the rest of the week off.  What a great idea. 
[00:01:30]  Celebrate the wonderfulness that was yesterday's show.  What a great idea.  Oh, wouldn't that be great?  And we're out of here for the week.  Thank you.  Leave on a high note?  No.  No, what I mean is you just gave me a great idea.  Oh, really?  Yes.  A great idea.  What are we doing?  Here, I'll turn off the mics for a second.  Oh, oh.  All right, yeah, that's good. 
[00:02:00]  That's a good idea, right?  It'll make sense someday.  Yeah.  Don't worry about it.  Anthony just gave me a great idea, though.  Don't worry about it.  Is this E-Rock's pictures from yesterday's amazing radio show?  Really amazing.  He had a lot of shots.  Two icons.  Yeah, and Brian Johnson.  Brian Johnson.  Jimmy Norton.  Oh, the very good.  Sorry, I just jumped on it.  Malcolm McDowell, Jimmy Norton.  And then Brian Johnson's in there, too. 
[00:02:30]  And that's your first step over for the day, because Jimmy was in the middle of a great  line, and I'm like, yeah, it was a great day.  Duh.  So, we had Brian Johnson of ACDC, who Jim Brewer has told us over the years is just a great  guest, and wow, Jim Brewer was correct.  And then we're clearing the studio out, because we had Malcolm McDowell coming in, and Brian  Johnson goes, Malcolm McDowell?  Yeah.  And stupid me, I'm just thinking in radio terms, I'm like, yeah, he's a fan of clockwork  arms, like we are. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, he saw the guy on TV a few times, and movies, whatever.  But no, see, they live in a different world, and he was like, holy shit, it's my old pal,  Malcolm McDowell, who I haven't seen in a while.  My mate.  So, the door opens, and they hug each other.  And then I'm thinking, Malcolm McDowell might think, this is some weird psycho fan.  How would he know ACDC?  Yeah.  Because it's Malcolm McDowell, movie star, you know?  Yeah, it is weird.  But it turns out, no, these guys really know each other, and then we just sat back and watched, 
[00:03:30]  and we just got praise for yesterday's show.  Because they had a great conversation with each other.  They sure did.  Why butt in?  Because this is a hook, oh, shook me all night long, back in black.  Like, you forget how many, like...  Highway to Heaven, which is a great song.  I know.  By the way, for the people, I caught it yesterday, but I'm...  You should say it, I didn't catch it.  No, sometimes you just let the...  Because I was reading it off a paper, and he did actually say that funny thing about  Angus had to go practice as an excuse for not driving the car with Phil Rudd. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Right.  Because he drives so fast.  Brian probably didn't catch it, though.  I don't think he caught it.  Yeah.  I don't think so.  So, everything was moving really fast.  I had him...  After our show, I did him for the Boneyard, and he's very...  Just a great guy.  And I'm having him pick songs.  And I opened up...  I have him pick a Bon Scott song, you know, from ACDC.  He picked one he liked.  Can you tell us which one?  Or does it have to be a surprise for the Boneyard show? 
[00:04:30]  No, no, no, it's Ride On.  Ride On.  Yeah.  That's a cool song.  And to close, I have him pick an ACDC song that he sang.  He goes, I'm going to do something with Black Ice.  And he goes, ugh, ugh.  And he fucking forgot the name of the song.  Okay.  The fourth one on the new record.  Oh, shit.  Oh, it was great.  He forgot his own fucking song.  Okay, so that...  And he forgot the lyrics when he was singing about Malcolm, too.  Yeah.  So, I don't think you even thought that I said Highway to Heaven. 
[00:05:00]  But, dude, I didn't know until I got home and they were killing me.  No, they were killing you.  Oh, were they killing you.  Oh, I...  Highway to Heaven.  I got queued up just in case people missed it.  Oh, no.  Here it is from yesterday's show.  Like, yours was, sorry, I got to stay home and rearrange my fridge magnets.  And fucking...  And Angus's was that he'd forgotten the riff to Highway to Heaven and had to practice it.  We all knew what you meant.  So, it wasn't worth nailing you and ruining, like, just the moment. 
[00:05:30]  Like, everyone knew what you meant, obviously.  But it is funny.  Malcolm's line...  Angus Young's line was...  His line about Angus was very funny.  That's great, yeah.  But, oh, look at me leaning over, needy.  Could you sign, Malcolm?  Fucking ugly old band neck I have now.  Yeah, that video's hilarious.  And I butted right in there because I knew that the publicist...  Look at the publicist is at the door waiting...  Right.  To just drag him right the fuck out of there.  Well, he came back to sign stuff.  And I needed, like, one...  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He wasn't... 
[00:06:00]  Spencer's great.  He literally had other interviews.  He had an out cue.  And Ronnie B...  Oh, okay.  Ronnie B for Ronnie B interviews.  Right.  Because Ron had to go to someplace, I think.  Sure.  Did you hear something?  So, Malcolm came back after...  Oh, that's great.  ...and signed a couple things on the table.  He was fucking great, man.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, the guy was fucking great, man.  What'd you get signed at?  One of the anniversary copies.  Very cool.  I'll go back to a couple nice pictures of Brian Johnson and Malcolm together.  That's a great...  You ought to get that to Brian and to Malcolm.  Oh, I both love that shot.  Everybody wants those pictures. 
[00:06:30]  They're people.  They're like, we need those pictures.  Yes, Eric.  Oh, E-Rock's got it.  Yeah, they're sending couriers over today because Warner Brothers, ACDC's management, Malcolm  McDowell's people all want these photos.  Then again...  Oh, are you going to get a credit, E-Rock?  I hope.  Then again...  A credit in a book, maybe?  Then again...  Photo by Fatso.  By the way, those are the ones that are going to release Malcolm and him.  Okay, I have nothing to do with us.  Oh, nothing to do with us.  Of course, nothing to do...  Yeah.  But we've got to give them the good ones, too.  That's why I photobombed one.  Is the photobombed?  You jumped in the background. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, that's on the disc for them, too.  Where's my photobomb?  That's why we're always in the background.  Yeah.  As two chums are getting to know each other again, they haven't seen each other in a while,  I have to be a fucking loser in the background.  You're mugging.  Dude, I almost did the same thing while they were talking.  I'm like, I wonder if I could just turn around and stand.  Inject yourself into their conversation.  I was thinking of a picture, but I couldn't do it.  Hey, I threw up a video, and the comment...  People love nervous fucking Jimmy.  Oh, my God, yes.  You are so nervous, Nelly.  I felt bad yesterday. 
[00:07:30]  It's hilarious.  No, I don't care.  Who gives a fuck?  I didn't mean to...  We have to do this show every goddamn day.  It was great.  It was so good.  Don't even fucking think twice about it.  Who gives a fuck?  I know, I just don't want to be fucking...  It makes you endearing.  You're getting all nervous about the eggs.  Wow, the video's doing well already.  All right.  I can't move my eggs.  You're just all upset about your eggs being put in the way.  I have to move these eggs.  Fucking eggs in my way.  Fucking eggs in my way. 
[00:08:00]  I had a wife move these eggs.  We're in the middle of Jimmy panicking.  Jimmy is in complete panic mode.  Malcolm McDowell's coming in from Clockwork Orange.  Johnson first.  Can you pause this for a second?  All right.  I got to ask Jimmy, because now it's a day later.  Did you realize at the time how fucking nervous you were coming across?  No.  Because me and Ann, we're dying.  We're dying.  We're like, he's losing his mind.  I was overly tired.  I haven't been sleeping very well.  So, no.  That's a good pause.  Your arms are up.  You're waving around. 
[00:08:30]  I'm flailing.  You were flailing and just babbling.  It was fantastic.  I was 45 minutes late for therapy yesterday, because I went right to the fucking...  No, it's okay.  I went right to the art place.  I call it the poster store.  Oh, and have it all mounted and everything nicely.  I don't get mountings, but just let it...  Oh, really?  Yeah, it was a fun day to follow Jimmy on Twitter yesterday.  He was tweeting as he went.  Yeah.  And now I'm at the poster store.  The poster store.  Someone told me on Twitter, and they're probably right, that the one Malcolm had never seen was 
[00:09:00]  probably from like 82 or in the 80s, because it was probably one of those some weird Australian  poster.  It's not...  Yeah, but why wouldn't they...  Oh, probably they couldn't use those people without paying them.  Really?  Sometimes that happens.  Oh, maybe.  I don't know.  Sometimes that happens.  Well, they might have been cross-promoting two films.  Like a poster, like an art house or something.  At a film festival.  The guy on Twitter told me why.  I wrote back.  I'm like, why do you think it's...  Because he seemed like he was convinced it was an Australian, not an original.  I want to know, because Malcolm McDowell never saw that before.  I don't mind getting him to sign that. 
[00:09:30]  That's great.  He was even like, wow, I've never seen this one before.  And he wrote a video.  He writes that.  Yeah, video.  That's cool.  How great was that to see that right now?  Can we go back to that video for a second?  I love watching Nervous Jimmy.  I'm like, it's 40 years ago.  I just want to say, it's like 40 years ago.  And the guy is still just fucking blurting lines out.  What else is he going to do?  It's just great.  Yeah, what else is he going to do?  What do you think we're going to be doing?  I know.  Just talking about...  So besides for Sam Day...  Yeah, let me tell you about that.  Yeah, it's the 40th anniversary. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, God.  I just wish I would have asked him about Caligula.  I mean...  Yeah, it was just one of those things where, obviously, you know, Brian Johnson's screwing  up our interview.  Yeah, wrecking the whole thing.  It was hard to, you know, get into as much as we wanted to.  They'll both, by the way, they'll both for the rest of their careers remember this radio  show.  Of course.  And Brian Johnson will have back easily.  And hopefully Malcolm...  Malcolm would come back.  Malcolm goes back to New York a lot.  So we'll have him too.  It was a great introduction for our show.  Go back to Nervous Jimmy.  This is too good.  Don't worry about it.  We have to get the TVs off and fucking Brian Johnson... 
[00:10:30]  Everybody...  We have to do Brian Johnson pictures of something a certain way because we can't have fucking  Malcolm up being like Brock Lesnar is.  Malcolm McDowell.  Right.  Okay, Jimmy.  The guy was like knighted.  Yes.  It'll work out.  So now...  Yes, sir?  Is he a sir?  I don't know.  Don't say that because if he's not, you'll feel like an asshole.  Yes.  Jimmy is now carefully opening up the...  Opening that.  You have a few things in there?  Two.  Two things.  And this is stuff you want Malcolm McDowell to sign.  I would hope that he would.  Yeah, I'm trying to think which one I want to open a certain way. 
[00:11:00]  I told you to leave it alone.  It's very important to work him off.  All right.  Can someone just hold this like really flat on the bottom?  Oh, yeah.  That's just Jimmy.  All right.  He's carefully opening it.  That's the thing there, Travis.  That's the end of the poster.  Do not fuck this up.  Mars, you punch it.  I'll give you $1,000.  Oh, God.  This right here...  I'll imagine just slamming here.  Jimmy's in another place.  He's watching this video.  He's not going to take it out, though.  Look, he doesn't want to take it out.  Why?  Because it was so hard to get in without being...  It's a fucking...  Bring the camera over here.  I'll show it to you.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God. 
[00:11:30]  I got to get up?  What is it?  It's the original movie poster, but it's the Japanese version.  Oh.  Let me see.  You can see how fucking delicate this poster.  It's the Japanese version of the poster.  Oh, my God.  I got to sneeze.  Oh.  Very nice, Jimmy.  I got that to be signed.  That was a Lulu.  All right.  And what's the other side?  Oh, let's turn it with this.  This one has a little thin British poster that I've never seen before. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, look at that.  I don't know what this is.  Well, you bought it.  What do you mean you don't know what it is?  It's a movie poster without the guys on it.  It's got different guys on it.  It's a different guy.  I don't know who they are.  They're different people.  For a fucking Broadway production?  Yeah.  I have no idea.  I'm going to have him just sign it right there.  But I want these two things signed and maybe the program.  That sounds like I'm going crazy.  No, you're not going crazy spending $1,100 on this stuff.  That wasn't very good.  But I had to do it, dude. 
[00:12:30]  The Japanese fucking poster is beautiful.  It's in perfect condition.  I've never seen it.  It's an original.  I had to get it.  The only thing odd, and you can tell it's Japanese because it says a crock work on it.  Old gag.  All right, Jimmy.  Japanese-y joke.  But, yeah, I went a little...  A look inside Jimmy's obsession.  This is his thing, man.  But it's like, this is a guy I really love and a fucking movie I love.  Sure.  So I don't feel bad.  This was a thrill for us, Malcolm.  Thank you so much.  Yeah, thanks so much.  Hey, great pleasure. 
[00:13:00]  Thanks, guys.  I think we're done for the day show.  Yes!  All right, we're getting out of here.  Thanks, guys.  See you tomorrow.  I'm looking right up on the thing.  Oh, you are right down.  I'm watching myself.  I'm embarrassing myself.  No!  Can you hold that?  It's obviously, you know, right after the interview with Malcolm, we cut to that.  Jimmy getting his stuff signed.  It's almost shameless, though.  More of a visual right now.  But it's like...  That's so cool.  And then Vidiwell.  Vidiwell he signs.  You got video fucking...  Video confirmation that that's his signature. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  A horrible signature, by the way.  Anyone could have scribbled that.  Yes.  But Malcolm even said about the other thing he signed for me, the third thing.  Which was...  I don't know.  It's a clockwork poster.  Wow, no.  See, I dive in there, too, because I'm afraid he's going to leave without me getting anything  signed.  They will rush him.  That thought.  Yeah, I thrust it in his face.  None of the people from the movie in there.  It's an odd poster.  I love Ant just trying to make noise on the other side, like, so Malcolm looks over.  Yeah, yeah, please.  Look, it's an odd poster. 
[00:14:00]  That's going to be worth something.  Hey, could you sign this, fucko?  But Malcolm's great, because he's like this...  He signed that little booklet for me, and he goes...  He didn't want to sign to anybody, but it's just because this is an original.  He just wanted to put his name on it, because he knew it would be worth more.  Wow.  This is great, dude.  Making money for people.  This is the part I want you guys to see.  So, Jimmy cares more about the poster that was just signed than actually the guy that  signed it.  Look, he's trying to get...  He hung Jimmy up.  And then Jimmy hung him up.  And then he's trying...  Malcolm's trying to get Jimmy's attention. 
[00:14:30]  He has to tap him, like, hey, thank you.  Because Jimmy's got his poster.  And holy kiss, the fuck is it about his poster that was signed?  I didn't mean to.  Oh, that's fantastic.  You had Malcolm McDowell actually tap you, like, hey, I'm saying goodbye to you.  Hey, I'm here.  You know, I think we made some kind of connection today.  You signed it already.  Shut up and leave.  Exactly.  Interaction over.  I don't need you anymore.  Don't you understand?  You're not a real person to me.  You're an entity from the movies.  You're movie man here.  Movie man in studio. 
[00:15:00]  Movie man.  A lot of people picked up on that.  What's that about?  You don't really care about the person after you signed it?  I don't think they care about me.  So it's like I feel bad trying to interact with him.  Plus, he was leaving.  And literally, he had just signed that.  And I also, like, what else do I need from the guy?  I don't want to overdo it.  Like, I don't want to bother him.  Right.  But he came back after.  And I felt bad asking him.  But he didn't give up.  He was very...  I think we plugged him really well.  He plugged the 40th Clockwork Anniversary.  He got a great interview.  And I actually want to watch...  I really want to watch that DVD that he asked me to plug. 
[00:15:30]  Which was him talking about his friend, the director, Lindsay something.  Who did Oh Lucky.  I actually want to see him.  No, you don't.  No one wants to see him.  Dude, he's a fucking great speaker.  No one wants to see that.  You don't actually want to see him.  I really do.  No, you don't.  I really would.  Because he's good when he does DVD commentary.  He's a fascinating guy to listen to.  Malcolm.  Yeah, man.  Fuck.  That was a great show yesterday.  Fuck yeah, man.  I went right to the fucking...  I went right to the fucking poster place.  Right there.  Dude, I called my therapist.  I'm like, I'm late. 
[00:16:00]  I'm going to be late.  Because...  I'm fucking getting things done.  Because once again, I'm getting posters framed.  The very reason I should be in your office right now.  Right.  That's what I was going to say.  But that's up to you to do.  That was a fun one, man.  Yeah, he'll...  And fucking look...  The after show was a lot of fun to listen to because the panic continued.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  The 10 o'clock hour yesterday was fun with Jimmy coming in afterwards, still panicking.  Oh, yeah.  And Brian Johnson was marching down hallways.  He's a nice guy, man.  Brian Johnson rules. 
[00:16:30]  Brian Johnson is a nice, nice guy.  Yeah.  Fun guy.  And we got Bernard Hopkins today who just fucking won the belt again.  He's the oldest guy in history to win a...  Beating out Foreman, right?  Yes.  Age-wise?  Yep.  Beat out Foreman.  45?  46.  I think Bernard's 46.  46.  46 and he wins.  He's a tough fucking...  And we really say guys never come back.  Yeah.  And this guy just won the belt and he's coming back.  Wow.  Right.  History making.  Very happy for him.  It'll be good to see him again.  It was funny last time I was in with all the prison stories and shit.  And then he came in...  Were you here at the time he came in after that? 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, you might not have been here when he came in again.  Nah, I probably wasn't, yeah.  The second time he came in and he sits very close.  Right.  But you don't get a threatening vibe from him.  No.  He's just a nice man.  Yeah, he really is a cool guy.  Really say something weird to him and then you'll...  No, dude, I watched a clip of Hopkins online.  You'll take a hook to the head.  He's a fucking...  He's a Philly tough dude.  And I was watching footage of him get annoyed at some fucking British cunt.  Oh no, really?  And you could just see that Bernard Hopkins is a guy that probably would punch a reporter 
[00:17:30]  in the face.  Like as a reaction.  Right.  He has to talk himself out of, I think, sometimes hitting people for fucking with him.  Yeah, he's one of those guys.  You guys want Brian Johnson and Malcolm McDowell singing from yesterday?  Yeah, I didn't...  I was screen capping.  What do you mean?  I wish he could have got them to sing Singing in the Rain.  Well...  I should have asked Malcolm that.  But he was talking about it and he didn't sing it, so I didn't want to go, could you  sing it?  Sing it. 
[00:18:00]  Go ahead.  Just do it.  Do it like you did in the movies.  Do it a bit.  Do it like in the movies.  Just do it.  Put the hat on.  Put the hat on.  The hat.  Put the eye on your sleeve.  It hit me.  So Brian Johnson, the door opens, Malcolm McDowell's outside, they run, they hug, they're like,  oh my god, haven't seen you in a while, blah, blah, blah, blah, two old pals.  That ACDC story when he had the tryout was really funny, too.  Oh yeah.  Holy crap, and he had a job to do. 
[00:18:30]  Didn't want to leave his vinyl roof job.  What did he say?  He had eight jobs that day.  Yeah, he's a busy man.  So he probably didn't believe that he had a shot at that.  So he almost blew the audition.  He almost didn't go.  He was late, right?  Could have been a whole other singer.  Might not have been as popular.  ACDC might have been just gone.  Yeah.  That's how shit works.  From that point forward, it might have just not panned out.  Back in Fuchsia.  Could have been a different...  Just all that ACDC with Brian Johnson.  Imagine if that was just non-existent. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Just never fucking...  Some fucking...  Some other Brit.  Yeah.  Fucking Willie Tetley.  Just Willie Tetley.  He bombs horribly.  The band breaks up and nothing ever comes of it.  Willie Tetley.  He decides it has to be Highway to Heaven.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Highway to Heaven.  Wrecks the whole vibe of the band.  Yeah.  Here...  So then they decide to sing impromptu.  They just sang a little something.  We got that from yesterday.  Is that an ACDC song that they sang or no?  No.  I think it's...  Brian wrote it though, I think. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Brian wrote it.  No, I think it's something they were working on or something.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, it was some kind of a show that they wanted to do.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Well, what about It's Good to Be God?  It's good to be God.  It's good to be almighty.  Oh, fuck.  He wrote the fucking letter.  I can't remember it.  It was a wailing letter.  It's good.  It's good.  It's alarmingly good.  Oh, how it's good to be God.  It's good to determine destinies of a dynasty or a nation. 
[00:20:00]  How mortal should they try to get ideas above their station?  What of an overwhelming feeling knowing everything is mine?  To be potent is very pleasing.  But omnipotence is fine.  It's good to be me.  Good.  And casting it out.  Oh, fuck.  No, that was brilliant.  That was brilliant.  He wrote that.  It's a brilliant musical.  Holy shit.  We only need, how much do we need?  Eight million?  That's it?  We'll get it on.  You'd have to sign a few more books.  Well, yeah, it's, but we'll get it on. 
[00:20:30]  I mean, we just had to stop because of this stuff.  He goes, I've got a great part for you, man.  I went, yeah?  He went, yeah, fucking Zeus, man.  You fucking Zeus.  And this is your, you're coming in.  You're flying over the fucking audience, man.  On a fucking wire.  And there's, there's, there's, there's fire coming out of your ass.  I went, are you serious?  He's fucking right.  I'm serious, man.  I mean, you're landing on the stage.  And you go, it's good to be gone.  It's good to be on the stage.  How great was that? 
[00:21:00]  That's a great, ridiculous sounding moment.  Oh, sure.  Oh, my God.  But Brian Johnson of ACDC singing kind of a musical number right there, right?  Yeah.  That's weird.  That was a spinal tap moment.  Right.  Because it's almost like, you know, we now have time to write that, you know, Saucy Jack.  You're a naughty one, Saucy Jack.  And they're like, you know, finally get a chance to do our, you know, projects we've been putting on the back burner.  Saucy Jack.  He wrote a musical already. 
[00:21:30]  I think in his book he talks about he was doing something because he was writing a musical at the time.  But I think he's probably written a few or a couple.  Sure.  There's a couple questions coming in, which this is a good question because I was wondering the same thing.  Brian in PA.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Brian.  My question is for Jimmy.  Hi, Brian.  Welcome aboard.  Hey, Jimmy.  Yes, Jimmy.  My own.  When Malcolm signed the, I think it was the second poster, he kind of pulled it out and looked at it.  I was wondering, were you freaking out when he grabbed the poster and pulled it out? 
[00:22:00]  You know.  Be honest, Jimmy.  Oh, imagine if it just went, just ripped off a handful.  And then has to give fucking Malcolm McDowell a talking to.  Because the thing was like the thickness of a rolling paper.  It really both were thin.  Yeah.  As much as it would have, I would have been like bummed about the poster.  Malcolm literally, if he would have taken a DVD and cracked it across my face, I'd still love him.  Which he should have.  Of course he should have.  And he should have bashed me with the Cooper collection because it's heavier.  You could see that you were nervous, though.  That he might, you know.  I still would have framed it, though, because Malcolm ripped it. 
[00:22:30]  But you would have to explain that somehow.  Oh, yeah.  I would tell people, Malcolm fucking ripped his, but you know.  That was such a good day, man.  It's weird when you're sitting next to him because he still sounds exactly the same.  You look in the face and the eye.  It's like, God damn it.  Yeah.  And he's doing clockwork orange lines.  Holy shit.  He's a weird, he's an actor that falls into that weird category of, they got their gigs  at a certain age where like five years later, they just looked old.  Yeah, old.  And that was it.  Like, they looked a lot younger for some of their roles than their age was. 
[00:23:00]  So then they kind of look a lot older a few years later.  But he's kind of plateaued off where he looks like that, and he's looked like he looks now  for years.  Since 82.  Yeah.  I just, I've seen if, I've never seen, I might have seen, I think I did see Oh, Lucky  Man, I just don't remember it.  And I think I didn't like it when I saw it, but I was a kid.  I was, you know, 13 or whatever, and I didn't, after clockwork, it was hard for me to like 
[00:23:30]  see him do anything else until I saw him do Caligula.  So I think that I want to see that again, and I want to see a few of his other older ones  again.  All right.  I don't know why I just said it.  By the way, how many times did I have to say yesterday that I said that him and Brian  Johnson would probably know each other?  Yeah.  Like, I did say that, but then it's like, who gives a shit?  And then it turns out to be a moment.  It was cool.  But who cared?  I didn't need credit for that.  Malcolm McDowell was hysterical when he walked in the door, though.  He was like, mate, oh, fuck.  Yeah.  They're just like, oh, fuck.  Two old pals.  Chris on Long Island. 
[00:24:00]  Good morning, ladies.  Hey, Chris.  Good morning.  I sat there on the hotline hold trying to talk to my idol, Brian Johnson, while meeting  Nancy fucking took every ounce of his time over there.  Thank you very much.  Oh, well, sorry for one of the listeners from Long Island.  I know, but that's sort of what annoys me is that, you know, you can't wait to meet  Brian Johnson, blah, blah, blah, and this morning you're talking about Highway to Heaven  would have been, Highway to Hell would have been a different title if they hadn't chosen  Brian Johnson, yet Highway to Hell was done before Brian Johnson. 
[00:24:30]  Brian Scott.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, right, right, right.  We know that.  Yeah, but it's just a, no, that, oh, God, what an asshole.  Yeah, but it's just a goof.  Chris, you're an asshole.  The point was that.  He's being literal Chris.  I know, the point being the song, Yes, was already there, but he, you know, some other  guy came in and his influence would have been to change that song.  Right.  That was the joke.  Yeah, it's I, guys.  Oh, my God.  I know that song is older than Brian Johnson.  I didn't at the moment when I said it.  I was literally.  I totally know that one. 
[00:25:00]  I'm not a, I don't know everything about ACDC, but I know some basic shit.  ACDC.  I fucking, I wrote that quote down from his book when I was reading it.  Because the book, I don't know if Chris, if you haven't read the book, it really is  funny.  I wasn't saying that just because he was here.  I went home and read more last night.  Like, I want to, I want to be finished with it by the weekend.  It's fucking a, really a funny book.  Yeah.  You're right, Jimmy.  I picked it up yesterday when, right after the interview and the first hundred pages  went by, you know, like that.  I didn't plug properly the book signings because I didn't realize, it was, again, it was such 
[00:25:30]  an overwhelming thing with those guys both being here, but I don't think Brian Johnson,  you know, I mean, you forget how, you don't realize, he's one of the biggest rock stars  on the planet.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You watch that fucking video, some of the live footage, it's astounding.  Dude, he talks about in 1991 in the book, there's a chapter where they're doing something  in 91, Boris Yeltsin asked his, like, some people, troops or whatever, or the public,  what do you want?  What can I do for you?  And they said, we want ACDC.  ACDC, motherfucker. 
[00:26:00]  And, of course, being the Russian premiere three days later, they had ACDC in fucking  Moscow.  Wow.  And fucking, they had a field and a hundred thousand people, on three days notice, a hundred  thousand fucking people, man.  Amazing.  And the whole band is just about as nice as Brian.  And, I mean, Phil is a little aloof.  Right.  He's had some problems in the past.  Yes, I know.  Phenomenal.  Every guy in that band, there's no rock star airs to them.  There's no...  So far, we've had Angus and Brian on, and they were both great. 
[00:26:30]  Angus, I wish we could have got in studio.  He was just plugging, like, a date.  He was plugging a gig.  But I would love to have gotten him in studio.  Yep.  I love how Brian says the name of the band.  It's a story.  Es-a-de-s-a.  Es-a-de-s-a.  Es-a-de-s-a.  Right.  What band are you talking about, motherfucker?  I was amazed that he hated the road.  Yeah.  I guess he gets sick of it.  After a while, he probably...  Yeah, the traveling.  He loves gigging, but he just doesn't like the traveling.  I know you're going to be in front of 100,000 people, though.  That's the fun part. 
[00:27:00]  I know, but I don't know.  Dude, I've got to go see them.  What's that, Danny?  You've got that poster.  Where's that from?  I was just looking at your Twitter.  Oh.  I'm still trying to look at it, but the shape of it looks like it's a daybill, not exactly  like a poster poster.  Right, right, right.  Daybills are usually skinny and long.  Oh, maybe, yeah.  So I'm just...  I hate not being able to find shit, so...  You'll find out what...  Somebody said Mark Ham, one of the guys on Twitter.  Thank you, Chris, by the way.  Is Chris still here?  Yes, I am.  Thanks, gentlemen.  Take care, buddy. 
[00:27:30]  Enjoy the book.  Enjoy it.  I think it's as simple as they didn't get the licensing for the guys.  They didn't want to get in trouble.  God damn it, that might be it.  You know?  It was just so weird when I saw it.  I had to kind of have it.  Oh, shit.  If anyone can figure it out, go to Jimmy's Twitter.  The poster's right there, and obviously Malcolm McDowell's not in the poster.  It's an Australian daybill.  Wow.  You know what?  That guy on Twitter knew what he was talking about.  Thank you.  But why not use the guys?  I think according to that guy, it was about cross-promoting. 
[00:28:00]  I'm guessing it was a festival or whatever, where there was a couple of movies.  Because Mark Hamill's on that poster, right?  What?  What?  Mark Hamill's in there?  What the hell?  One of the soldiers, the guy said.  What year is it?  In 82?  Now that we know where...  There's not a lot of info on this particular page.  But now that we know what it is, now I want to know why there's other guys on the poster  and not Malcolm McDowell.  That's the question today.  Because that's the weird part about this whole fucking thing.  Yeah. 
[00:28:30]  I knew it was odd because none of those guys...  Why is it...  It must be promoting that...  Because I think those descriptions, tense, da-da-da, da-da-da, are not about clockwork.  I think they're about the guys in the bottom.  I think that's a movie poster with the words, Clockwork Orange, put on it.  Yeah.  I think so.  Yeah, but I kind of...  We'll try to figure it out.  I'm guessing it's at least 20 years old.  Yeah, let's it.  We got something to play here.  Great.  From yesterday.  Fantastic.  Fantastic.  Oh.  Want to play this?  Oh. 
[00:29:00]  I don't even really know what this is, so we're going to play this cold.  Oh.  Burr.  All right.  That's good.  That's good.  Mm-hmm.  It's good stuff.  Uh-huh.  Oh, God.  Just...  Okay.  That was...  Oh, man.  Ah!  Ow.  Wow.  By the way, let's try that again.  By the way, there was nothing playing.  Do you want to...  People are like, can't hear shit!  I fooled you!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  Yeah, there's nothing on this.  Nothing on the disc.  I tried twice. 
[00:29:30]  You want to hear Needy?  Yes, Jimmy.  I went down...  This is what a fucking...  I went down to the cellar last night to do a set, and it was really good.  Like, the crowd was great, and I'm just working on a new 15 minutes of stuff, and I'm just  enjoying it a lot.  All right.  And I had a great set, and all I was thinking of, like, while I was killing, is I fucking  wish that Malcolm and Brian were over there watching.  Oh, my God.  I thought that.  Oh, you're a little boy. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, my God.  You're a sweet boy.  I'm pathetic.  And they'd be laughing and laughing.  Yeah, no, they'd probably be talking and making...  I'd probably have them thrown out.  I fucking couldn't.  Brian would be signing stuff, taking pictures, have them removed.  Yeah.  Shut up.  Do you want to be friends with them?  Of course I do.  I'd love to hang out with Malcolm.  But then again, I'd probably have a better shot with Brian, because he's friends with  Brewery.  He probably likes comedians.  Malcolm's just done with it, too.  Yeah.  Malcolm's been famous for fucking 40 years.  Forever. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Well, moving on to today's show.  Kubrick.  I'm sure we'll be going back to yesterday's show.  American Idol ended, eh?  Oh, it did?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Was she with Priest on?  Yeah.  Oh, that's what I heard.  Yeah.  Florentine Twittered it.  I read a tweet from Florentine.  Yeah.  Does anyone know why Priest was on Idol?  Hmm.  What did they...  Just performing?  That's...  Maybe that's the Steven Tyler influence.  Oh, really? 
[00:31:00]  Called up Judas and said, hey, man.  You want a spot?  Here comes Sam.  I guess Sam watched.  Of course Sam watched.  Why wouldn't he?  We used to watch American Idol, though.  I know.  And I could tell you, I did not catch one second of American Idol this season at all.  My sister was up from Florida.  I saw one episode.  I'm done with it.  I saw one.  I never...  I'm done with it.  You know what I was watching yesterday that was fascinating before we get into this real  quick?  I was watching that fucking Casey Anthony trial. 
[00:31:30]  It was on Headline News.  They were just playing it live.  They were playing it.  And I'm thinking, like, now that's a fucking reality show.  It was the testimony of the boyfriend that was with this woman when her daughter went  missing.  And she never said anything to this guy.  So he's like, it was crucial testimony.  And I'm watching going, this is a real reality show.  And if she loses, she fucking dies. 
[00:32:00]  It's like...  Yeah.  They're not going to kill a cute girl.  She gets the death penalty.  It's like, no, this is a death penalty.  It's a capital murder case.  But they'll wait for her to be really ugly.  And then they'll finally kill her.  They never killed a cute one.  Let me tell you something.  She's despicable.  Of course she is.  And the jury hates this fucking woman.  You know what they say?  They're saying she killed a kid.  She killed her kid because she wanted to live the lifestyle of a single, young woman that 
[00:32:30]  went out to clubs and fucking was able to, you know, have fun, enter these fucking  hot body contest, go around with this fucking promoter, hip hop promoter boyfriend, white  wigger guy that apparently lives in New York.  I was looking at him going, this guy's got to be a fan of the show.  Oh, really?  It just fits the complete fucking bill.  You never want to know.  But he had nothing to do with the kids.  No, no.  But he had nothing to do with the parents.  Was he sticking up for her or going, no?  Well, he was just pretty much just the facts.  It was weird because he couldn't really tell which side he leaned on. 
[00:33:00]  But he was just saying what he what he saw during that time that she was with him and  this daughter just went missing and she never mentioned him that, hey, my daughter's missing.  Fuck.  She never mentioned.  And she said anytime he'd ask like where the kid was, she went, oh, she's with either  her mother or the nanny that she said was named Zanny, Zanny, the nanny. 
[00:33:30]  And then I'm sitting there going, holy shit, she fucking would give Xanax to the kid because  it turns out Zanny didn't exist.  So you give a Zanny to the kid.  The kid falls asleep.  Now you could just go out and party.  So she named the fucking Zanny nanny, the Zanny.  Oh, my God.  And maybe overdosed the kid.  It could have been accidental.  Overdosed the kid, but then they found the kid with duct tape.  They found a skull with duct tape around its mouth and shit.  It's just a bunch.  It's a fascinating murder trial. 
[00:34:00]  How old was the kid?  Two years.  Two years old.  That's that's that's my new problem.  Now that I'm a father.  Well, you can't watch it like that.  No, I can't even imagine why you would would ever do that.  Yeah, I can't even imagine.  That's why this woman comes off as despicable and narcissistic and just a psychopath.  Because she they're they're pushing it that she killed her own fucking kid so she could  party.  But we can't let you slide.  You were watching because she's hot. 
[00:34:30]  I she she is my type.  She's got that look and she's a complete psychopath.  She doesn't like kids.  So I probably would have.  She obviously doesn't point.  She's perfect for you.  Except for the murder.  Yeah, except for that murder thing.  But she does prove she doesn't really like kids, which you like.  You like that in a while.  Yeah.  And they make her up like they make her up for the court like she's all prim and proper.  She's wearing this Laura Ingalls shirt and shit yesterday.  And the almost looks like a C cup a little bit. 
[00:35:00]  A C cup a C cup a little bit or whatever.  A C cup.  Yeah, she's got a she's got a good look to her and shit like that.  I kind of like that psycho thing she's got going on.  But the testimony was fucking compelling, really cool.  And then I'm watching like little things that they do.  At one point, the prosecution comes up and start questioning the boyfriend about certain things.  And then and it's well into the testimony, well into the trial.  And the prosecuting attorney goes, he goes, oh, we've been we've been talking about, you know, Casey Anthony. 
[00:35:30]  He goes, could you please it is she here in the courtroom?  Do you see her?  And he's like, yeah, he goes, could you point her out?  And the defense now next to her is shaking his head like, holy fuck, they're going to allow this.  They make her stand up and they make the boyfriend point at her.  And I'm like, that's fucking brilliant because it's so accusatory.  It's like one of those things where it's like, no matter what she did or didn't do for the jury to see a guy on the stand have to point at somebody. 
[00:36:00]  It instantly makes you look fucking guilty.  And it's also a brilliant thing because it pits one against the other.  Right, right.  And I had a theory.  Regardless if you're sticking up for her or not.  Right.  Now you're pointing at someone in a courtroom.  It's just great shit.  You said Xanax.  You know what?  Maybe she may have accidentally overdosed the kid and then panicked and set up a fake kidnapping.  And maybe that's what the duct tape is from. 
[00:36:30]  The duct tape might be from a scene she had staged.  Yes.  That's what they were saying also.  Oh, fuck.  They were saying there's a few theories.  And they said that the kid, they might say she drowned in the pool because she used to like going in the pool and she might have drowned.  And then she panicked and her and her father covered up the crime.  And then the latest thing was, they actually got to the point where the father had to go up there.  And they asked if the father had molested her when she was a youngster. 
[00:37:00]  And that's what fucked her up.  So the defense is now having to pull the father onto the fucking stand and defend himself against sexual allegations.  Because he went, no, I never sexually assaulted my daughter.  Well, that leads to Sarah from Buffalo, a regular to the show.  Roseanne Barr on Twitter supporting the mom because of her sexual abuse claims.  Oh, really?  Roseanne says she understands.  She's a pathological liar, this woman.  Yeah.  It's just everything that comes out of her is a lie.  She's, like I said, narcissistic.  And that's what makes this like a compelling, amazing reality show. 
[00:37:30]  And it's not fast-paced.  It's not scripted.  You get moments that are like, holy fuck, that's really cool.  But for the most part, it's a lot of, you know, okay, can I approach the bench, Your Honor?  And then they go to break and shit and stuff.  So it's not this high-speed bullshit reality show crap.  But it's real.  And like I said, the end game is it's a capital murder case.  This woman could be put to death if she loses this show.  You really think she's hot. 
[00:38:00]  I could hear her in your voice.  Oh, I like her.  I like her.  The excitement.  She looks better.  If she was a pig, you wouldn't be watching this closely.  But no one else would either.  It's the fact that she wanted to go out.  There's a sexiness to this twisted trial.  Some of the pictures on the day her daughter disappeared, there's pictures of her at this  club where she's got leg in between, like her legs are a stripper or a fucking shot girl's  leg is in between on her crotch and she's smiling and wearing a little skirt and shit. 
[00:38:30]  What a fucking pig.  Yeah, yeah.  I wonder if she did kill the kid.  Because if the kid fell in the pool, you would probably acknowledge that.  Or if the kid overdosed on Xanax, you would say, she took my Xanax, she found them and  took them.  Right, which is definitely a possibility.  I think she killed her.  But there's a diary entry also for, I think, the day or a couple of days after the girl  disappeared that was saying, I have no regrets what I did. 
[00:39:00]  I'll just have to see how this worked out.  I've met so many nice people lately.  I hope this continues.  Like, it's very vague, but put in the context of murdering your fucking kid, it kind of  figures.  Like, she's just one of these women that, and it's not unprecedented, that women want  to have the single life back and be all fucking, look, yeah, there she is partying.  Look at that, she's partying and partying.  She really does look murderable, though. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, you really hope.  It's great.  She looks so trashy.  I love it.  She is a very fucking, is that her right there?  Yeah.  She's a really fucking hateable person.  Yeah, she's completely hateable.  And the jury is, like, completely not standing.  A lot of these pictures we're looking at after the kid went missing?  Yes!  Holy shit.  That's fucking dope.  Yes, and she never told this boyfriend that she had that the kid was missing.  That's fucked up.  The kid went missing in, I guess, early to mid-June of 2008, and they found the body in December 
[00:40:00]  of 2008.  So months went by where she didn't tell anyone anyway.  She didn't even report the daughter missing.  The grandmother had to report the daughter missing.  She was telling the grandmother, because the grandmother was like, I want to see my granddaughter,  and she kept making up stories as to where the kid was.  Like, oh, and then finally, you know, the grandmother was like, my granddaughter's fucking  missing.  What a fucking pig.  But that does, in a way, that shows you that she's crazy.  Yes, yes.  Oh, Jesus.  Will they actually kill her, though?  I don't know. 
[00:40:30]  With those tits?  I don't know.  And she...  What state is this?  After the girl's missing, Florida, Orlando.  After the kid went missing, she also got that tattoo.  So she got tatted.  She got fucking...  What the fuck?  She's having the time of her life.  I think she's nuts.  Not on a town!  Yeah.  I think she's nuts, because Susan Smith killed her kids, and then went into a thing with  the black guy who took the car.  Right.  Had the story.  She immediately went into damage control to get away with it. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  This fucking lunatic is just like, ah, no, she's a...  She's a thing!  She just blocked it out like it never fucking happened.  And that's what they're using.  Like, they're saying, the same way she blocked out her father abusing her sexually, she's blocked  out her either killing her daughter or disposing of an accidental death or something like that.  In order to just not acknowledge that this bad thing happened, much as she does not acknowledge 
[00:41:30]  the sexual abuse of her father.  So that's kind of an angle they're trying to work, but it comes off as a desperate move  on the defense part to try to get her out of maybe even just getting the death penalty.  So you're going to be watching again today, huh?  Oh, hell yeah!  You're all in?  I'm all in on this one.  It's a really, like I said, compelling, amazing view into the criminal justice system, the  despicable lawyers, the press. 
[00:42:00]  Like, there was a clip yesterday of her defense attorney coming into the courtroom, and the  press is right on top of him with a camera trying to get around him.  To one point, he trips over a cord.  The defense attorney trips over a cord from the camera, bangs his head into a light pole  on the street, and starts motherfucking the camera guy.  It's classic.  This is awesome.  It's fucking classic.  It's true TV, too, right?  Yeah, I didn't think true TV is doing it.  Finally, true TV is doing something, actually.  Yeah, yeah.  It is real.  That's real.  Real, real.  Cassius in Brooklyn, go ahead. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I saw this thing on 48 Hours a couple weeks ago about this, and you guys, you should try  to find her mugshots online, because one of them, or a couple of them, they're just  so creepy.  Like, you feel like you're looking at her face of just total evil, like pure evil.  It's really, like, hair-raising.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, yeah, I see.  Which one?  I don't know.  She kind of looks like a, you know, she'd go out.  Her just not saying...  She's got her hazy eyes.  Look at her pouting eyes.  To me, her just saying nothing, to me, that is the sign of a nut, though, because you 
[00:43:00]  can't get away with a two-year-old being gone.  Just gone all of a sudden.  She was probably, I think she probably, I don't know, maybe she did kill her.  Her just leaving the kid fucking all Xanaxed up and going out.  Look at all the way to the left.  Look at the picture all the way to the left.  That's fucking not bad.  Too much white.  Just a lousy mother.  Too much white in her eyes.  I don't know.  She got nice.  If you can see all the whites, that means they're crazy.  Look at baby blues.  She got baby blues.  Actually, the one on the right's much better than the one on the left. 
[00:43:30]  The one on the right looks good.  She was, you know, also, there are times during the trial where, and you could tell, I picked  up on this, how narcissistic she is.  She sits there with a straight face through all this testimony about where she was, how  she never acknowledged that the daughter was missing, how she never talked about a missing  girl.  Could you help me find my daughter?  Any of that shit.  She was straight faced. 
[00:44:00]  She'd occasionally lean over, cover her mouth while she talked to her lawyer.  And then there was a testimony that the boyfriend had that they had to break into a storage shed  in the backyard of her house to get a gas can because her car was out of gas.  And he said, I had to open the shed.  I had to break the lock because she couldn't.  And the lawyer goes, well, she couldn't.  Okay.  How much, how much did she weigh at the time?  And she starts like, they show her and she put her head down and starts chuckling. 
[00:44:30]  Like the whole trial and the daughter and all that meant nothing.  She just sits there stone face.  But the second it's about her and how much does she weigh and now her ex-boyfriend having  to talk about her weight, she starts chuckling like, oh me, it's my weight.  And now let me see what he says I weigh.  Let me see if it's right.  Oh, you put a few extra pounds up.  Like that was the part that got her to smile during a murder trial. 
[00:45:00]  How much do you weigh?  You know what they should do if she's found guilty?  They should fucking razor slice her face.  What a vain fucking cunt.  Someone might do it in prison.  Nah, they won't.  You know, I've had nothing to hear about prison justice.  That's bullshit.  They don't fucking kill pedophiles.  But once in a while, there was a guy in California when me and Kenny were out there.  And I don't know what...  You don't have to say a guy.  We all know who it is.  It was me.  It was you, Jimmy, was it?  There was a guy in California. 
[00:45:30]  And he called a young lady, in quotes.  You know, there was a guy in jail.  I think I said this.  In San Quentin, there was a drunk driver who had gotten nine convictions.  And he killed like a little kid drunk driving.  And her father lost a leg.  I don't get kicks.  And some white supremacist fucking just knew this guy had to go.  Oh, wow.  The white guy was doing life without parole.  And this fucking motherfucker was ten days into his sentence.  And this white supremacist fucking slashed his jugular from both sides.  Whoa.  And then just waited.  And he just turned himself in.  Because he's right there in the yard. 
[00:46:00]  It's like, yeah, it was me.  It was me.  All right, what are you going to give me?  Now, two life sentences.  Ooh.  You don't have enough of that prison justice.  We're a guy who's a fucking.  That's true, yeah.  That's what you need is guys like that.  Yep.  Just to have their fucking jugular's cut, man.  Yeah.  She's probably one of the fucking, you know, queens in the, or one of the queens have  her as one of their little bitches or something.  No, man.  She's probably well protected.  No.  Well, the female prisons.  I watch a lot of those, you know, prison shows and shit.  And when they show the guy prisons, it's just this horrific looking environment where 
[00:46:30]  you're like, I never want to be there.  Ever.  And then they show the women's prisons.  And it's like, it's a very maternal kind of atmosphere.  They take care of each other.  Yeah.  There's picnic tables in the yard.  Believe me, there's probably some forced pussy eating.  I'm sure there's some forced snatch eating.  Could you add the word rank to that?  Rank forced snatch eating.  But for the most part, it's like this supportive thing.  They all sit around those little round tables and play gin rummy. 
[00:47:00]  They have real relationships, loving relationships.  Yeah, yeah.  Very loving, not just ass rape.  So, yeah.  So, who knows what the fuck is going on in there?  But she, I don't think she's very liked.  When does this show start up again today?  I don't know.  Whenever the fucking trial starts, I turn it on and it's on.  And it's just kind of very entertaining.  And like I said, because we were talking about American Idol and reality shows, this to me  is my type of reality show because it's real, real, totally not scripted. 
[00:47:30]  You get to know the players, almost like the OJ trial was, you know, but a different, obviously  a different work.  I hear the excitement in your voice.  It's almost impossible to talk to you right now.  Very excited.  You are just filling in every single second of dead air.  It's amazing.  You're really excited about this trial.  Where did they find the body?  In a wooded area about five miles from her house.  The skull, it was skeletal.  And the skull had duct tape around the mouth. 
[00:48:00]  And there was actually a heart sticker.  She had like these heart stickers over the mouth.  That's the mother.  Yeah.  I'll tell you why.  Because even a mother who's a cunt, there's a really weird guilt thing.  Weird, yeah.  When you kill the kid, there's something loving.  That's love or heart on the lips.  Believe me.  That's why a lot of times they position the body a certain way.  Or they position the hand over the genital so you can't see it.  There's all this weird shit people do when they kill somebody they love.  The way they panic when they're covering it up. 
[00:48:30]  That's the fucking mother putting heart stickers on.  Love you.  I love you.  Let me dig this shallow grave and dump you in it.  She borrowed a shovel from a neighbor during that time.  There was a Winnie the Pooh blanket that was missing from the house and was found at the scene of where the body was found.  Oh yeah, she brought her favorite blanket.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, she wrapped her in her favorite blanket.  All those things.  No fucking random guy is going to wrap her in her favorite blanket. 
[00:49:00]  I wonder if she put the duct tape on after death to keep things out of her mouth.  Was there some weird fucking reason?  Yeah, yeah, something.  Because whether it was a staged kidnapping murder that she did or whether it was some kind of maternal, let me help my daughter.  She probably didn't want to kill her, but she was taking crazy chances if she's feeding her Xanax.  There was Xanny the nanny.  Right, and all of a sudden things went horribly wrong and now she's trying to cover up the murder. 
[00:49:30]  We were fucking laughing yesterday.  It's like, oh, I have a whole stable of nannies.  There's a Vika coming over and Oxy.  Yeah, the nanny Oxy's coming over.  Is it true that she had the kid in the trunk for a few months?  That's speculated.  That's why they couldn't find the body?  Yeah, they were speculating because there was a real rank smell coming from the trunk.  What the fuck?  But they also found garbage in the trunk, like an old pizza and maggots were in there.  So there was rotting garbage, which could be responsible for the smell. 
[00:50:00]  I don't know if they found any DNA evidence in the trunk, but there was a horrid smell coming from the trunk of the car.  Unless she put the pizza in after.  Yeah, yeah, to maybe cover up.  Alanis Morissette.  Yeah, well, she has kind of a...  It's like you took her face...  She grew her hair out.  ...and twisted it a little and made a little Alanis out of it.  Let's stretch her face out slightly.  It's Alanis Morissette.  Oh, yeah, look at that.  Definitely in the eyes a little bit.  A little bit.  Fuck, man. 
[00:50:30]  So, uh...  What was the cause of death?  Um, the remains were so skeletal that I don't think they were really able to come up with it.  Oh, they couldn't.  But it could have been some kind of...  That's why, you know...  Was it smothering or strangulation or fucking...  Yeah, asphyxiation.  Can't they go to get a piece of hair and find out what...  And they think it might have been suffocation by the duct tape, which would just be a horrible fucking...  Like the kid wouldn't stop yelling or screaming or crying, and she duct taped her mouth,  and the fucking kid couldn't breathe through her nose and suffocated.  Yeah, suffocated. 
[00:51:00]  There's a bunch of things, because they are speculating that she was doing things before the kid died  so she could go out.  Like, you know, duct tape the kid's mouth shut, give her some nanny-zanny, and go out.  Night on the town.  And she never spent the night over her boyfriend's house  until after the day the girl went missing.  And then she was over there spending the night, almost every night.  They should really cut this woman's throat.  There's so many things pointing against her. 
[00:51:30]  I don't know what the defense is going to do about this, but it's very interesting to watch.  It's one of those trials that, like, this is kind of cool to watch.  And I hate saying cool, because a girl's dead, but as far as the trial part of it goes,  if you separate yourself from everything that happened, oh, exactly.  So you can say it's cool to watch, because we're detached from this, so yeah, it's cool to watch.  Yeah, because I'm watching certain parts.  You're like, oh, man, whoa.  It's the only reason why it's on TV.  Yeah.  Yep. 
[00:52:00]  It's kind of a freak show, and it's cool to watch.  Yes, you're absolutely right.  It's reality programming.  It's disgusting and all that, and being a father, I can't even express that thought to you.  But yeah, it's cool to watch.  They really don't get into the real details, or I don't know if they have yet or haven't  yet, get into the details of how the body, you know, the skeletal remains looked, how  it was found, speculation on how it died, the medical examiner, things like that.  Who found it?  I think it was just some guy walking through the woods, you know, kind of stumbled upon 
[00:52:30]  it.  But yeah, pretty interesting shit.  Why would she leave the duct tape on it?  Then again, I'm asking a rational question.  Weird, yeah, just such a weird fucking broad man.  She's just a fucking kook.  They really, if she did it, and if she did it as a murderer as opposed to an accidental  death, if she was duct taping the kid's mouth and going out, she should just have a fucking  bullet put in her.  I don't know why we're so...  Despicable.  ...polite in this country. 
[00:53:00]  What does this have to do with Idol, though?  I'm confused.  Reality TV.  Reality, yeah.  And what should happen to people on American Idol.  That's true.  I do remember...  When you vote it off, just duct tape their mouth and nose shut.  Watch them squirm.  I do remember, I was asking why Judas Priest was on American Idol.  That's right.  How did we get here?  That's the beauty of this show.  You're going to bring a gay angle to it.  Wait a minute.  Why don't we break?  We'll find out why Judas Priest was on Idol.  Yes.  I heard the DeLeo brothers backed up Steven Tyler last night.  That would have been cool to watch. 
[00:53:30]  So maybe Idol was cool to watch last night.  You got Judas Priest and Steven Tyler playing with the DeLeo brothers from STP.  Oh, wow.  That's kind of nice.  Yeah, okay.  And then Oprah said goodbye yesterday.  Good riddance.  Goodbye.  Everyone talking about it like she's a fucking messiah.  Stop it.  She was on a show for 25 years.  God bless her.  She did a great job.  But Jesus, she canonized the woman for fuck's sake.  She helped a lot of people around the world, sir.  Did she?  Yes, she did.  At the fucking African rape schools that she was building? 
[00:54:00]  Those fucking things?  Well, in between rapes, people were getting some good educations.  Oh, okay.  You know.  Just fuck me running.  We'll get into some of this shit next.  Don't forget Bernard Hopkins coming in today.  Tom Popp is at eight and Bernard's at nine.  Everyone is telling us that he said that McNabb wasn't black enough, which is a big fucking...  I got that.  Oh, you got it.  Of course.  We got to ask him about it.  Yeah.  Dude.  We got to ask him about it.  That mother, he says whatever he wants.  He said McNabb is not black enough.  Yeah, he's bashing him about...  He said something about McNabb. 
[00:54:30]  He said...  Which is ironic.  He goes, well, he's up in the house while a lot of us are in the fields.  Calling him a house nigger, I guess, is what he's saying.  Which is odd because Bernard...  McNabb is the one on the field.  Yeah, we got to ask him about that.  A lot of controversy over that statement.  And Tom Popp coming in at eight o'clock.  Stay there.  The virus.  Get in touch with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Call 866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969. 
[00:55:00]  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yeah, happy birthday to Lenny Kravitz.  Thank you.  Oh.  47 years old today.  Oh.  Matt Stone turned 40 today from South Park.  Really?  Wow.  For the people that care.  Damn.  How long have that guy been...  That's it?  Yeah.  Hey.  Mere youngsters.  Hey, this French douche, Dominique Strauss-Kahn.  So he's under house arrest, right?  Con.  Con. 
[00:55:30]  His house arrest is going to take place in a $14 million townhouse with a private spa and  movie theater.  He's paying for it, though.  If you want to rape me, you're going to have to come down here, Con.  You're going to have to come down here.  Yeah, he...  Yeah, that's his house arrest.  Because he's paying for it.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  What is it?  What are you going to do?  How much was it a month?  It's a $15,000.  $14 million townhouse.  Yeah.  The way it worked out was because he's a flea risk and he's so rich, they're allowing him 
[00:56:00]  only to be out on bail, like a million dollars bail.  If he pays for his own...  He has to pay for armed security, which will prevent him from leaving.  He has to be 24-hour bracelet-ed.  He has to pay...  Oh, it's a GPS?  Yeah.  And it's like, I almost understand it because most people would get bail for that type of  an assault.  They wouldn't keep you locked up till trial on an assault like that, especially when it  wasn't like a fucking brutal...  They wouldn't.  He's a flight risk, of course.  That's why, yeah.  The guy can go to France and never see justice at all. 
[00:56:30]  They hire a plane to fly in there.  But it's pissing off people that it's a $14 million townhouse, but there's nothing we  can do about that.  But why is anybody mad about it when he's paying for it?  Yeah, I didn't know that.  And most people are allowed to go out on bail, and they don't have to pay for additional  security and whatever.  He just...  Oh, so you're on this guy's side?  Yes.  I mean, look, $3,000 a night in a hotel, when you take it out, members of the staff should  be obligated to wet it with their mouth or palm.  Nice. 
[00:57:00]  They're paying $50,000 a month for rent on this place.  That's nothing to this guy.  No, he's a billionaire.  But that's just it.  It's like, you know...  The guy should just fucking be in jail.  They should be like, the guy's a flight risk.  Fuck the security and everything.  It's like...  But Jimmy's saying that other people would get bail for a crime like this.  I think most people would get bail.  Even though he was trying to flee, most people would get bail.  And I think a part of it is they don't need this guy in jail getting his fucking throat 
[00:57:30]  cut or getting stabbed.  It's just too much of an international incident before he's convicted.  And he's not going to be able to flee with the GPS thing, so...  You know what, though?  It's fucking...  It's not out of the realm of possibility, because he's not in a prison environment.  There's guards that he's paying.  Yeah, but they're armed security.  He's paying them, but he didn't hire them.  I guarantee you...  It's not guys he brought in.  I guarantee that they're fucking...  They're just giving him the bill.  He's paying the bill. 
[00:58:00]  That's it.  And they're like, there's no way these guys can let him flee.  Are those them right there?  Yeah.  Standing in front of the jail?  Yeah, they got pictures of those fucking...  What if he fucking repels down the side of the building?  He's got a GPS bracelet.  He's not going anywhere.  What if he does something...  How's he going to get that fucking...  How's he going to get the bracelet off?  He's got plenty of time to sit there and tinker.  Would you saw your own fucking leg off to get the GPS bracelet off?  And then you leave it fucking sitting there, right?  I'm asking a question.  If you know you could get to France,  all you have to do is fucking sacrifice your foot...  Fuck, no.  Would you do that?  I don't think so.  I'll figure out another way. 
[00:58:30]  If you know you're going to be free...  Yeah.  I would.  Like fucking saw.  I would fucking...  I would have to do that.  Like the first saw.  Yeah.  You got to just fucking take that hacksaw  and cut your fucking foot off.  You put your fucking leg on a table like this  and you just take the saw...  And then you leave the GPS thing in there?  Yeah.  Still on the foot.  I think you got to put it on something that moves, though.  Put it on a dog.  Yeah.  Put it on something that moves.  Isn't that what they do in movies?  They put it on a dog or something? 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, yeah.  On a dog.  You got to shove it into a candy bar  and then have some rats running around the place?  I pulled it out of my nose.  How about this, though?  Yeah.  I don't know how it works internationally,  but he has enough juice in France.  Oh, yeah.  What if he was just to rush to Teterboro Airport?  Right.  Literally with the bracelet going...  Because that's the noise I think the bracelet should make.  Yes, it would.  What if he was just to go to Teterboro Airport,  have a plane waiting for him,  and get on the plane...  He would never make it to Teterboro. 
[00:59:30]  They're watching the guy.  But I mean...  If he could get past the guards, let's say.  Let's say.  Let's say he could get to an airport with a private plane.  But they probably have zones where all of a sudden they're like,  okay, now we're a little fucking worried right here.  What the fuck is he doing?  Way before he gets anywhere near...  Say he cuts it off.  Say he hires someone to cut it off.  Right.  Say you give the guards a million dollars apiece.  It's a tough piece of cash to turn down.  It's turn your head.  But how does he cut it off?  Because I don't know if that's the easiest thing in the world to do.  I'm sure they go...  With all sorts of shit going on. 
[01:00:00]  I'm sure it goes off.  It's very hard to cut off.  But you've got to figure it out, you know.  Let's say he does.  Let's say he can get outside into a car.  Get to Teterboro Airport.  Or just leave.  They wouldn't know where he was going to cut the bracelet off.  But the...  France would take him.  But getting the fucking bracelet off, I would like to know about how easy that is.  Or how about...  It doesn't sound like it's an easy thing to do.  Because without all sorts of alarms going on.  I'm sure it's very hard to do.  What's response time, though?  It's like you have your people set everything up. 
[01:00:30]  So there's a plane waiting for you.  Yeah.  You've got a nice fucking Gulfstream waiting for you.  You then...  Yeah.  You just take off with the bracelet.  You hop in a fucking car.  You race there.  You know how fucking reaction time is for all kinds of shit.  It ain't as fast as everyone thinks it is.  They track him down.  By that time, he's in the air.  And then...  Military plane is not going to force him to land.  Nope.  I would leave immediately. 
[01:01:00]  I would just fucking set it up.  Get me the fuck out of here.  Get me to France.  They wouldn't extradite him.  Never.  No.  France didn't give him back anybody.  Because France doesn't like the way he's being treated.  They're actually on his side.  Yeah.  I'm sure he's thinking all this stuff.  But he's still got to get the fucking bracelet off.  No.  I think you could get away from that.  I think you could outrun the people that are watching the tracking device at some remote  location or whatever.  For a guy like this?  Yeah.  No way.  I think you're in the car. 
[01:01:30]  You're fucking driving.  But I think if you're a mere couple miles from the townhouse, that's the red alert.  That's good.  Have a guy...  That's the red alert.  ...tail your car and purposely cause an accident in the tunnel behind you.  If you're in the tunnel, they know where you're going.  They would radio a head to the other side of the tunnel.  Plus, by the way, if you're him, you don't go with a fucking car.  You take a helicopter.  Jersey?  Yeah.  Maybe.  Nice work, Dominique.  As a girl's bleeding from her gums. 
[01:02:00]  You take...  Oh, how about that?  A helicopter now.  You hire yourself a helicopter.  Sure.  Picks you up.  Takes you to Teterboro.  Yeah, just like that.  And literally, you're on the...  But then again, going through...  What kind of security do you have to go through before you get on a plane?  You might have to go through some security.  And the helicopter's going to...  No, it's not a private plane.  They pull those fucking things up, and a car pulls up.  I've seen it happen.  I've seen it fucking happen.  You guys are nuts.  They pull that car right up to the fucking plane, especially...  You ever see those fucking Arab guys?  They don't go through shit. 
[01:02:30]  They fucking have their own security team.  They get on the plane.  The limo pulls right up to the fucking plane.  We're thinking this.  So New York City is thinking this.  They believe me.  Losing him is embarrassing.  They're not going to lose this guy.  None of this is going to happen.  What's wrong with you guys?  It's a helicopter, and it's going to land safely at Teterboro, where the plane's waiting?  That's not that crazy.  Why not?  Because they wouldn't know that it's him.  It's just another helicopter coming in.  With a bracelet.  And another Gulfstream leaving. 
[01:03:00]  You have to understand how to cut that thing off without the fucking...  I don't think so.  Alarm's going off.  Say it's going off.  I think you can outrun the response time of them putting everything together, having  a team that can run out, get the guy.  They've got to drive faster than him to get to him.  You're fucking...  You could get to the heliport.  From where is he?  Rikers?  I mean, he's right in Midtown, right?  I do think, though, with this guy, because of who he is and he's so high profile, the response  time would be immediate, because losing him is embarrassing. 
[01:03:30]  And the guards are federal marshals, by the way, okay?  He's not going to pay off federal marshals anytime soon.  Okay, yeah.  Just kind of get off, you know, you've got to sneak out.  And this guy knows a little bit about the security bracelets.  I'm not allowing this.  I'm sorry.  The federal marshals...  You guys are doing movie scenarios, and it's kind of cool, but it's not happening.  The federal marshals is the problem.  Mike at PA.  Mike.  Mike.  Hi, Mike.  Hey, how you doing?  What if we say the dirty marshals?  Oh.  We've got some guys on the payroll at the paper. 
[01:04:00]  I know you.  You work at Mike's Bracewood Emporium.  You're my enemy.  Go ahead, Mike.  After all that, it was the wrong guy.  It's actually Steve in Kentucky that I need.  Yes.  Steve.  Bang, get it, bang, get it, bang, get it.  That's the guitar strumming.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, I used to date somebody who used to deal with stick offenders with the GPS system.  Yeah.  Tracking bracelets and everything.  Yeah.  She told me a little bit about it. 
[01:04:30]  Even if you adjust it a certain way, it would send off like an alarm for the people who are monitoring it 24 hours a day.  And with somebody this high profile, it would be kind of hard to lose track of them.  Or even if you were to adjust the little ankle, the little bracelet around his ankle.  No, dude.  We're not saying out.  We're saying outrun the response time.  Yes.  Like, it's going to go off.  But once you're in the air, they're not going to shoot you down, and they're not going to use military planes to force you to land. 
[01:05:00]  I mean, that's just too much of a fucking...  They'll have a red alert at all the airports and the security at all the airports, even Teterboro.  You're not knowing it's him.  You don't know it's him.  Let me tell you something, though.  This rope's right.  That helicopter's going off.  They see where he's headed.  Believe me, they know where Teterboro is.  They immediately would say, shut down all outgoing flights from Teterboro.  Like, this guy is coming.  Look for him.  Even if they don't know he's in a helicopter. 
[01:05:30]  That fast.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, come on.  This guy's a fucking head of the International Monetary Fund.  He's a big one, dude.  I don't have enough faith in anything to think anyone can respond that quickly.  I've seen enough shit where it's like you'd like to think they can, but I don't think they can.  Well, I don't know.  Hold on, Mitch.  It's my opinion.  Mitch.  Go ahead, Mitch.  Hey, this is what's going to happen, boys.  He's going to take a helicopter.  How much water surrounds New York? 
[01:06:00]  He's going to take helicopters to some remote place that has a submarine waiting for you.  What the fuck?  Was he Dr. Evil?  What's wrong with you guys?  He's Dr. Evil.  He's going to get a submarine.  And then where's the sub going?  Up down the Hudson.  He's going to go to France.  In a submarine.  In a submarine.  All the way to France.  Yeah.  You're right, though.  By the time, once he goes up in the air, there would be a red alert at all airports. 
[01:06:30]  He would not get out of a commercial airliner.  And the private, I guarantee they know all the private airports within 50 miles.  They would say, this guy, look out for him on any outgoing flights.  How about then the second, the second you get out of the building and into something else,  you completely fuck that bracelet up?  That alert would still be put out because they'd know where he's going.  How would they know where he's going?  Airport.  Where else can he go?  Yeah.  How many airports are there to check?  You're going to close down, hold on.  You're going to close down LaGuardia, Kennedy, fucking Teterboro, Newark. 
[01:07:00]  You don't need to close them.  All on the thing that he might be going to one of those airports.  No, no, no.  You don't have to close them.  You put out an alert for him.  This guy's coming.  Look out for him.  In a commercial airliner, he would never try to get on.  Because you have to go through security with a ticket.  And they're paying attention to him way more than anybody else.  It would be private.  This is what you do.  So you keep everything out of his name.  I've hopped on a fucking plane.  This is what you do.  You hire Tom fucking Cruz.  Yeah.  Exactly. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, Mission Impossible.  Exactly.  This is a Mission Impossible scenario.  I've jumped on a plane.  I've taken a private plane to one of the casinos from Republic Airport.  And I never saw the fucking inside of the airport.  I had a bag with me.  I fucking went to the limo, to the fucking plane, right on the plane.  The thing gets to the runway, and you're off.  You didn't come on a fucking maid.  Yeah, but...  Well, I did.  No, I didn't.  You did it legally.  But you're not... 
[01:08:00]  Let me go to Mike DeCoff.  See, the thing is, you're fucking...  They don't know that that's for him.  It doesn't matter.  They would put an alert out at all airports and all private planes saying,  Look, this guy is a flight risk.  And they would have somebody who's watching those gates.  Your picture would be in every single one.  And they would all be looking for you to come through a gate to hop on any plane that was outbound.  I guarantee that's the first thing they would do.  With this guy.  Yes, with this guy.  With this guy.  Mike the Cop.  Mike! 
[01:08:30]  What's up, boys?  Hello.  You guys are jumping way too much.  No way is this French fuck even going to get out of this little townhouse.  All right, I'm a cop.  I know exactly how they do it.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  How do they do it?  I'm a cop.  It depends on who they contract out.  And they contract out the marshals, which sometimes they do.  Federal marshals.  Right.  They're going to tell this guy,  Listen, if you leave, you will be killed.  And he's going to be like, blah, blah, blah.  Okay, okay.  Now let's say they even pay...  Shoot the hostage. 
[01:09:00]  Or whoever it is.  Wherever he goes, there's no way he's getting out of this country.  And you're right.  They're not going to fucking shoot him down.  There's no way this prick is going to leave this townhouse.  I guarantee you.  First of all, he's going to be scared off his mind.  You know, he's going to be fucking shot.  So I just want to pass on that guy.  They're not going to shoot first.  Let me go to Bill in Alabama.  Unarmed.  Bill.  Just fucking some old guy.  They're going to tackle him, but they're not going to shoot him.  All right.  Do you all do realize that you're describing a movie SWAT, don't you? 
[01:09:30]  They're describing a million different movies.  I don't know.  I think...  I say it's plausible.  Not busted.  Plausible.  Can a private...  Can a Gulfstream make it to France without refueling?  Um...  Hmm.  You have to leave this country immediately and then refuel in a fucking...  Because I guarantee...  First of all, it's not like he could just fly somewhere else and land and get on a fucking Boeing that he rented. 
[01:10:00]  I think you can make it to France.  I think you can make it to France.  Because the flight plans have to be put in...  Of course you can make it to France.  Yeah, that's just it.  If there's a flight plan put in for France, but maybe there's not.  Pilots can't just fucking do the...  They can't just go somewhere.  Once they take off...  Hey, guy.  Here's fucking...  Here's fucking...  Five million dollars.  Put in a fake flight plan.  But then you're an accessory and you're in... 
[01:10:30]  Again, I'm just...  And I'll put you up in France.  It'll be great.  There is a way to do it.  But they've thought of it if we're thinking of it.  And they're also saying that he's under video surveillance, so...  Well, you know what you gotta do?  You gotta make a loop of the video.  And then sit there...  Like speed.  With one little glitch.  And hope that they don't see the one little glitch.  Did you drink crazy juice last night?  What?  You're fucking crazy today.  No, it's totally plausible.  It's not totally plausible.  I'll give you a little plausible. 
[01:11:00]  I'll give you a slightly plausible.  Confirmed.  Not totally.  I say confirmed.  No, slight.  See, the Marshall...  Slightly.  Anything can happen, as they like to say.  The Marshalls are almost unbribable because of the nature...  Of the high-profile nature.  No matter how much money you give them, they're gonna go to jail for it.  Like, they can't be bribed because...  We can't lose this guy.  Mission Impossible mask.  All right.  Yeah, you put that on somebody else.  Sit them in front of the video camera watching TV.  Fair enough.  And now you leave dressed like an old bag. 
[01:11:30]  What's your Mission Impossible, though?  The TV show or the movie?  Movie.  Or a movie.  Better mask.  Yeah, and the vocal transposer.  We can't lose this guy.  Here's how you do it.  As a city, we can't lose this guy.  Here's how you do it.  Okay.  I guess that's how every movie starts, but...  Yeah.  Those guys have to eat.  His guards eat.  So what you do is, you have...  Whether they're eating together or one is on guard, however they are...  Is that any of the nanny?  You fucking have somebody really heavily dope the food, and you know that they are out. 
[01:12:00]  Because they have to eat.  Or they have to have their cup of coffee.  Whatever the fuck they have.  Now, the problem is gonna be the video cameras are on you all the time.  And the thing.  But we've already taken...  But we've already taken...  What happens when you eat?  They dope you.  If your food is doped...  The guy's a...  He's a billionaire.  He's not us.  He's connecting...  Who's doping the food, and where are they getting the dope from?  Dude, they found his people in Africa that are already taught.  They found his fucking people.  So he's gonna have...  They were fighting a gazelle to make a left.  Yeah, yeah.  And they found them. 
[01:12:30]  They found her family.  And those dummies said something about money not being important to them.  Well, they have to say that.  What are they gonna say?  Old Aidsie over there really hit the jackpot?  You think they're drooling like, oh, fuck, man.  Dude, they probably offered him 50 bucks and a new hat.  Right.  You can sell this felt hat to a witch doctor, and he'll give you something to fucking help  your ear holes.  And some slightly used Nikes.  Yeah.  Some American products.  Right.  Trinkets.  But you've already taken care of the marshals.  He's got the money.  When you have a billion dollars...  So someone's gonna poison the marshals as they're eating their... 
[01:13:00]  No, they're poisoning them.  Drug them.  Drug them.  That's all right.  You slip them a mickey.  You fucking get whoever...  And all of a sudden, like you've seen in a million movies, they're gonna be out cold,  and then this guy's gonna cut the bracelet off.  Their heads are gonna clunk together, and then they're gonna slowly...  Right.  And then he's gonna climb up to a roof, and then the helicopter's gonna be there with  a ladder, so he fucking shimmies up the ladder, and then...  And then you hear...  Oh, man.  It does sound very crazy.  But?  But then again, would France... 
[01:13:30]  Hold on now.  Would France even accept him fleeing like this?  They may, but they may not accept him.  They welcome fucking their own criminals with open arms.  Okay.  They really do.  Probably would.  You're right.  They love when the French come back to roost those criminals.  Is that Elizabeth Smart?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  She's pretty.  She's out?  Oh, no.  I'm sorry.  She's...  No, I think she's a teacher, yeah.  What do you think?  Is it Muslim law? 
[01:14:00]  You think she's pretty?  She's out of prison?  You really think she's pretty?  Yeah.  She's not bad.  I like her.  She's hotter when she got kidnapped.  I like her.  She's all right.  She looks good now.  She's in her, what, 20s?  Oh, Brian.  She's in her 20s.  Man.  That ain't bad.  Let me see that.  She looks good.  Yeah, fucking...  Come on, she's a little celebrity.  I call her Elizabeth Bookler or something.  She just had to take some sleazebag's dick when she was 14 and now she's a, you know, celebrity. 
[01:14:30]  Elizabeth Smarty Pants.  So what happened with Priest on Idol?  I do need to know this.  What happened?  Why, uh...  Why Priest for American Idol?  That's confusing to me.  That's a big band.  No one has an answer to this?  Big name.  Huh?  What did they come out and do?  I don't know.  Sam.  Ah, here's Sam.  Why Priest on Idol?  Because they brought back James.  Whatever his name is.  Who's James?  Is he the Will Ferrell guy?  Will Ferrell guy?  No, no, no. 
[01:15:00]  There's one guy that kind of looked like Will Ferrell.  That's Casey Abrams.  Casey, all right.  They brought back James who was like the big...  He was the metal guy.  Is he the one with the twitches?  Yeah, the little Tourette's.  He had Tourette's?  Yeah.  Oh, really?  He had a pretty good voice.  I do remember.  I've seen a little bit of him.  He came in fourth.  So what did they do?  His idol was Judas Priest?  Is that what happened?  Yeah, yeah.  He was like the...  He wanted to bring metal back.  That was his...  Or give metal a chance was his little catchphrase that he always said.  And then Judas Priest was his band, so they came on and they did...  Oh, Breaking the Law?  Breaking the Law was his second song. 
[01:15:30]  I can't remember what the first one was.  Breaking the Law.  Breaking the Law.  Yeah, they have to go with the hits.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Big time.  So it's got to be living after midnight and then breaking the law, probably.  Because the kids don't know Judas Priest.  Was it exciting?  Yeah, the finale was very exciting.  It was exhilarating.  They rocked it?  Judas Priest?  Yeah.  Yeah, they did.  And how did Tyler sound?  And did he play with the DeLeo brothers like I'm hearing?  I'm not sure.  He may have.  I know he played...  He was on the piano, though.  Because I didn't see he was backing him up. 
[01:16:00]  He was playing Dream On.  Oh.  Oh, he hasn't done that one ever.  A million times.  What made it different?  He was on the piano.  Do I have to play this clip?  Again, it's like your name's on the wall, so I can't tell you what you...  Ryan Ounce is the winner of American Idol.  Do we care about this?  No.  What do you mean no?  I wouldn't even know who it is.  America cares.  Over 100 billion votes.  That's not true.  100 million.  Was it a big year? 
[01:16:30]  The ratings went up a little bit this year, right?  It was a big year to watch.  One of the lowest-rated finales ever for American Idol.  The finale was not strong.  But the year itself was big, especially with the new judges.  They turned out to be good.  Was Scorch counting the votes?  I know.  Really?  No?  He was using the app counting.  Hey, let me tell you how many votes.  We had 82 million billion votes.  This is Scorch.  Yeah, I would say it was a big year for Idol, but it was more about the judges than it  was about the contestants.  The contestants weren't great. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I heard the ratings went up slightly.  Well, yeah, they did.  The first time, because it's been going down.  Yeah, but it's been going down.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Was that a better finale than Oprah's finale?  Ugh.  I would say so, because there were surprises.  And you're not a fan of Oprah?  No.  I know it's not our demo, but...  Well, the whole Oprah thing...  What's your take on the whole Oprah thing?  She's helped a lot of people.  Fucking...  Yeah.  Very successful.  25 years.  Yeah.  She's a powerful person, man.  Yeah.  Oprah's a powerful woman. 
[01:17:30]  Most powerful woman in the world.  She's got a few billion dollars.  Not in entertainment.  Hillary Clinton's more powerful than she is.  In the world?  Oh, God, yeah.  In the world, Oprah does not wield much power.  She's the biggest celebrity in our country, but Hillary Clinton makes policy decisions and  stuff.  She was actually ranked number two in a list that just came out.  In celebrities?  Yeah.  Let me guess number one.  Can we guess?  Is it Lady Gaga or Kim Kardashian?  It's the Gaga.  It's the Gaga.  It's gotta be the Gaga.  Gotta be the Gaga.  Anthony, Opie, you guys are correct. 
[01:18:00]  Lady Gaga.  Lady Gaga was ranked number one.  No, you said Lady Gaga or Kim Kardashian.  That's not fair.  Yeah, the Kim Kardashian was a bad fucking guess.  She's engaged.  Whoa.  To Chris Humphreys.  That's right.  Really?  He spent two million on a ring.  Holy shit.  Exactly.  You can't wear a two million dollar ring.  No.  So it's a waste of time.  Great, Ray.  What do you do with it?  All right, so.  Keep it on a point.  All right, well, Oprah started her last show with this.  She decided to downplay it.  You don't.  Hold on. 
[01:18:30]  Uh-oh, what happened?  Are we back to the French guy escaping?  Yeah.  Tunnels?  Let's go tunnels.  No.  You drug the guys.  You have one of your guys.  One of your guys brings the food in as a delivery person.  Well, you hire a guy.  And you're a federal marshal thinking, oh, this guy's just being nice getting my food today.  No, no, no.  They order food.  They order food.  You have when the food comes.  Yeah.  You have it fucking, however, either your guy brings it up or you give the delivery guy  $10,000 in cash.  Take the bag. 
[01:19:00]  You bring it up as a delivery guy.  One of your guys do it.  Fucking give them drugged food.  Not that they're going to kill him, but that's going to make them pass out very heavily doped  up food or coffee.  They fucking go out.  Believe me.  You ever take fucking, you ever get an anesthesia?  You're out.  There's no thought.  You're like, hey, done.  You give them something like that.  Okay.  They're out.  Right.  That problem's solved.  Yeah.  I'll get to the rest later.  I'm going step by step.  Did you guys do pills before the show or something?  No.  I didn't.  No.  This is fascinating.  That's not a crazy thought.  I'm out of this party, man. 
[01:19:30]  This is a puzzle because you're looking at it logically.  You can't be logical when you have a billion dollars.  Because we're dealing with the federal marshals.  They're logical people.  Doesn't matter.  They know these dumb scenarios.  Corruption.  Money.  They know these dumb scenarios.  They know the food scenario.  They know the helicopter scenario.  They know all the scenarios.  I don't know about the food one.  They wouldn't.  Oh, these cops.  You're acting like they're just dumb movie cops.  I don't know.  Cops always order food.  I don't even think you have to think that far into it.  I think you'd have to get past them, dude.  Well, we'll have to wait and see because, you know, this guy is in fucking trouble. 
[01:20:00]  So he would want to take the chance of fleeing.  So we'll see.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  We're not doing the auto thing.  But this is Oprah opening up her final show.  All right.  Because you had a very good observation.  Oh, boy.  It is no coincidence that I always wanted to be a teacher.  And I ended up in the world's biggest classroom.  And this, my friends, will be our last class from this stage. 
[01:20:30]  So today, there will be no guests.  There will be no makeovers, no surprises.  Really, no surprises.  Surprise overload from United Center.  You will not be getting a car or a treat.  This last hour is really about me saying, thank you.  It is my love letter to you.  Now, the laughs you hear from the crowd is a disappointment. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, disappointment, nervous laughing.  Because if you're getting the last fucking, if you're getting a seat at the last show for Oprah,  you're thinking in your head as you're driving over to Harpo, like, holy shit, she's going to give me a house today.  This is like a house.  She has to be giving out houses today.  And on my last show, I want to do one last thing.  Give everyone a house.  You're all getting a house.  And it's like, wow, wow.  And they go crazy.  So as they're laughing, they're all sitting there in that audience going,  oh, man, I really thought this was going to be a biggie today for us. 
[01:21:30]  So the gift is you telling me thanks?  They were invited guests, a lot of them celebrities.  You motherfucker.  No, that was the day before.  The day before, yeah, this was just in the audience.  In the audience, I mean.  In the audience, Maria Shriver was in the audience.  On the last night?  A lot of big celebrities that did not come up.  No one came on stage with her.  Because I heard...  Well, they all were on the stage the day before.  Over a million ticket requests.  They did an over-the-top second-to-last show.  Yeah.  With Hanks and, I don't know.  I saw... 
[01:22:00]  Jordan was there?  With his Hitler mustache?  I don't know.  Fuck.  I'm not sure, but I know Jordan was there.  Tyler Perry was there crying about his rape.  Jesus.  Oh, he was fucking diddled as a child.  Oh, was he?  Yeah, he had a fucking breakdown on the show with her once.  Oh, wow.  Which allowed other men to come out and talk about their experiences.  She's like, courage.  I saw that show.  The audience was filled with everyone that was diddled. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And they were able to finally talk about it because of Tyler Perry.  He made a fortune putting a dress on, that motherfucker.  Got a lot of money.  That's Tyler Perry.  Did you feel guilty because it felt good?  It felt good.  Oh, here it is.  A lot of people feel guilty when they're molesting because it feels good.  Well, I think maybe you're right because I remember seeing some clips of this.  Oprah.  It's Oprah.  Oh, very special.  Oprah jingly start. 
[01:23:00]  You know, we have, Tyler and I are friends and we talk a lot.  But it wasn't until last night when I was talking to the producers about this story that I first heard that you had been beaten so badly that one time you blacked out for three days.  It was around, you know, my father, he played all these mind games with me and there was a door in my bedroom and there were six panels in the door and the top two panels were glass and it was broken at the bottom.  And then the hole is about this big and he would stand there staring at me for hours and I didn't know it. 
[01:23:30]  I would be reading a book or something or playing and I would look up and I see these greenish gray eyes just staring at me.  It was horrifying.  What a creep.  And he played these mind games with me.  This one in particular, he wanted me to change a tire and I could not change the tire.  And my mother comes out and she's trying to help me change this tire and she calls my uncle to come and help.  And he's standing on the wrench and he can't get the bolts to loose.  So I have to go in the house and tell him that I can't change the tire. 
[01:24:00]  My mother's standing there.  She's like, she doesn't know what to do.  So I go in and I tell him and he went into a rage and he comes back.  And he puts the thing there to change the tire and he couldn't get the bolts off.  Slap the fucking bolt with a Popeye's wing.  And he looked up at me and there was a smirk on my face.  And all I remember is him tackling me and I remember holding on to a chain link fence and I'm holding so tight my hands are bloody as he's hitting me.  And I'm holding, just trying to hold on for my life and I feel myself trying to get to that place, trying to get to the park. 
[01:24:30]  In your mind.  In my mind, I'm trying to get to the park so I can deal with this and I can't.  Oh, he's breaking down.  I couldn't get there.  And I was so enraged about it and I kept trying and trying.  And when I finally was, I saw the grass coming in my mind, I see myself running from me.  Wow.  And I couldn't get the little boy. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, he's losing us.  I couldn't get the little boy to come back to me.  I couldn't get myself to come back to me.  That's terrific.  I died that day and I don't understand.  It took me so long to understand what happened.  Turn the wrench, you friggin'.  You Mary.  Wait, what happened?  Turn the lug wrench.  What happened?  Figure it out.  What happened?  Leverage.  Get a breaker bar, dummy.  What happened?  Ah, he can't take off a lug bolt and now he's fucking freaking out running to the park. 
[01:25:30]  He wasn't molested though, just beaten up.  No, he was molested.  Ooh.  Yeah, he was molested.  He was dead old too.  That was just the physical and mental abuse of his father.  But my God, man.  You ever hear of leverage?  You gotta use leverage on those bolts.  Is he gay?  He sounds gay.  He does sound gay.  Yeah.  But I don't think it's ever been, there's no news about whether he is or not, so that's  all speculation.  So Oprah didn't give anything away?  No, she's very greedy on her last show. 
[01:26:00]  She plucked a pube and gave it to every audience member.  Pube for everybody?  Yeah.  And this is how she said goodbye after 25 years.  Adios.  Au revoir.  But she'll be back within 90 days on her network, Owned.  Owned.  So she's not really going away, she's just moving into other things now.  She was getting, what did they say, 14 million viewers were popping in and out of her show  a week for a regular show.  Okay.  And on Owned, she gets a couple hundred thousand. 
[01:26:30]  Who's fucking set that up?  The fucking people at Sirius?  Yeah.  I had a channel change?  Come over here.  Yes, who did that?  The guy?  Exactly.  But I think she needed for this to go away, so then she could put herself on her own channel  in such a way that it'll bring all the viewers in.  Yeah, because why are you going to go over there?  Why would you go over there if you still got the big show on ABC?  Because now she could go, I'm over here now.  I'm over here now. 
[01:27:00]  I'm over here now.  There was no real reason to go over there yet.  No, because she was over there.  She was on there a little bit, but not as much, and now she could definitely have her presence there.  Yeah, I think you'll see.  And then the viewers will flood in, obviously.  I don't think she's going to do $14 million, though.  No.  People don't know where it is.  Huh?  People don't know where it is.  You have to find it.  I don't know what it is.  Right.  Everyone knew where Oprah was.  You know, the Own is one thing, but she should have just called it Oprah.  The whole channel.  It's like calling it the virus. 
[01:27:30]  Oprah's new channel, the virus.  But Oprah can also market, this is what Owned Oprah Wedfrey Network.  Look, she's not being, she isn't with anybody who's embarrassed to market her.  Oh, that's true.  Right.  Here's Oprah saying goodbye.  This is how it went down yesterday after 25.  Fuck all y'all.  I've been asked many times during this farewell season, is ending the show bittersweet?  Well, I say all sweet.  No bitter.  And here's why. 
[01:28:00]  Many of us have been together for 25 years.  We have hooted and hollered together.  Had our aha moments.  We ugly cried together.  And we did our gratitude journals.  So I thank you all for your support and your trust in me.  I thank you for sharing this yellow brick road of blessings.  I thank you for tuning in every day along with your mothers and your sisters and your daughters, 
[01:28:30]  your partners, gay and otherwise, your friends, and all the husbands who got coaxed into watching Oprah.  And I thank you for being as much of a sweet inspiration for me as I've tried to be for you.  I won't say goodbye.  I'll just say, until we meet again.  To God be the glory.  To God be the glory.  And for some reason or another, you sound a little taller on radio. 
[01:29:00]  So, that was it.  It was just her in a chair yesterday.  Oh, yeah?  Yes.  I was twittering last night.  I should have been sleeping just about the things I wish she would have done to end the show.  And people's responses were really barbaric and funny.  Of course they were.  But I did think it would be funny if she had ended the show like her last show had been her on stage  and she had just went, hidey, hidey, hidey, ho.  Hidey, ho, hidey, ho.  And then just done Minnie the Moocher until people. 
[01:29:30]  Were uncomfortable and left.  Like if she just didn't stop singing it.  That would be really awkward.  For a couple of minutes they'd laugh.  And then after five minutes, and then literally 15 minutes into it, she'd be going, hello, down, who?  Big pit stains, sweat on her arms.  People in the audience are glancing at their watches.  What is she doing?  Why is she doing this?  And then they would just start hustling people out. 
[01:30:00]  She'd be alone on the stage.  All confused.  Doing Minnie the Moocher.  God, would that be fantastic to watch.  What a breakdown.  A giant underarm stains on her fucking fat lady pantsuit.  And that's Oprah saying goodbye.  And then some guy tweeted that at the end of her show, she'd have been a harpoon going through her back  and her being hauled into a Japanese ship.  It was so mean and funny.  I had to retweet it.  You're going to make a whale joke.  You're going to make Elo cry tonight. 
[01:30:30]  Elo's going to cry.  Oh, so fucking good.  It was so fucking mean and funny.  All right.  Tom Popp is here.  We're going to take a break.  Get him on the show.  Oh, before the break, we should play.  Oh, he's done Oprah.  Yeah, he's done Oprah with Jerry.  Actually, Seinfeld did Oprah.  Tom just sat there.  Sat there and watched.  Yeah, I didn't see it, but I'm assuming that's what happened.  Watched the magic happen.  And Tom went, holy shit, I'm on Oprah.  Jerry.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's kind of cool.  Yeah.  Tom just panicked.  Here's, from before that disc, we worked it out.  Oh.

[01:33:30]  Hi, everybody.  We welcome Tom Papa to the studio.  Yay.  And we just found out that he has an Oprah moment.  Oprah moment.  I mean, Oprah ended her 25-year run yesterday, I guess.  Yeah.  We remember seeing Tom Papa on Oprah with Jerry Seinfeld.  Yeah, last year.  So I asked you about it, and you said it was a nightmare?  Is that an exact quote from Tom Papa?  It was a total nightmare.  I, uh...  You know, you're going to do Oprah.  It's bizarre to begin with. 
[01:34:00]  And, uh, we had to, because of weather, Jerry and I had to leave the night before, and just  like bolt.  I was taping the show, and then the marriage ref, and then we had to, you know, like,  this weather, we've got to go immediately.  So I had to call my wife.  I'm like, I've got to fly, like, directly from the show to go to Oprah.  It sounded so cool.  Like, I'm going to, I've got to take a jet to Oprah.  So can you pack a bag for me?  So my wife packs my bag for me, and, uh, she has a toiletry case. 
[01:34:30]  So we get there, we open it up, I'm getting ready to do Oprah, and you have to wake up  real early in the morning, and I open up my toiletry case, and the only thing my wife  packed was a toothbrush.  No deodorant.  Oh, shit.  No hair product, no nothing.  Nothing.  But the deodorant was really the, the bummer, because I'm going to do Oprah, I've got no  deodorant.  You're going to be nervous.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're running around.  So I throw my suit on, I'm just like, kind of flapping the pits, trying to keep them loose, 
[01:35:00]  trying to, trying to not sweat, and, uh, I get there, you go to this complex, it's a,  it's a whole city block.  I mean, it's this gigantic, like, she owns this whole city block.  Were you nervous?  That's a crazy amount of money.  Um, yeah, I was, but, you know, you're nervous, but you're, you've done all this stuff so much  that you're just, like, telling yourself it's cool, you're like, it's no big deal, and then  my pits start sweating.  Did you feel the drips down your side? 
[01:35:30]  Totally.  Just those total little beads just coming down and hitting, the worst part is when it, it'll  start coming down, and then go free, and then catch again on your love handle.  Like, it doesn't ride the U, it just dives straight for the, and I, you know, I wasn't  dressing myself, people, like, were giving me clothes from the show, so I had, like, this  little boy shirt, and it's just, totally, and I'm backstage, and I'm waiting to see 
[01:36:00]  Oprah, and I'm, like, literally, I can't, I asked, I'm asking them, can you get me  deodorant?  They're, like, this weird, this is deodorant.  And so it's taking a long time, and I just scurry into the bathroom, and take toilet  paper, like, and start putting it, pack it in my pits to try not to sweat.  Wow, you get rank, I guess, huh?  I do, I sweat.  I sweat a lot.  But in that situation, I know exactly what you're talking about.  Yeah, you're going to be sweating.  If you're telling yourself, I can't sweat, I can't sweat, I can't sweat, you're going to 
[01:36:30]  be sweating, so then she comes backstage to say hello, and I'm with the Seinfelds, and  I'm there with another person that was a producer on the show, and Oprah comes walking  in, and it's like, holy shit, this is Oprah.  I mean, then it really hit me, like, shitballs, she's gigantic, and she comes in and hugs  Jerry, and hugs Jessica, and hugs the other lady, and then comes to me, and I see, she's  hugging everybody, so I just go in for a hug, too, and she's extending the hand, like, 
[01:37:00]  and here comes giant pit man with saddlebags, two saddlebags of sweat, and it was too late,  so I just, it looks terrible, and she gave one of those quiet, like, as you're in there  with the hug, just, oh, okay.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, she didn't want to hug you.  Oh, she didn't want to hug me at all.  You weren't famous enough to be hugged by Oprah. 
[01:37:30]  No.  That's cringy.  Just when you think you might have a little fame out there, and you're not famous enough  to be hugged by Oprah.  Well, you know, she's fucking hugging everybody, that's not your fault.  She's hugging everybody.  You thought she's a huggy person, you don't know if I'm a hole in the wall.  Exactly, you think, well, Oprah, maybe it's a love thing, maybe it's a...  Everyone's close, so when you get out there, you're all like, you've hugged.  No.  Oh, okay.  Maybe you look like someone she knew when she was nine.  Oh, boy.  Oh, brother.  Oh, brother. 
[01:38:00]  By the way, what hotel were you in that didn't have a gift shop to get the fucking bill to  away?  It was just too...  Yeah, he was on a tent schedule.  You're in that system, you know.  It's a smell.  What was that?  Oh, nothing.  He's asking about the French joke.  I hear the facility's amazing.  Like you said, it's a city block.  A whole city block.  This metal door opens and you drive into the building.  Wow.  Like NORAD?  They let you out.  Yeah, totally.  And the thing closes, you get out, there's all these guys in suits, and you just...  And what's bizarre is, you know, like even here, like there's shows going on, there's 
[01:38:30]  people bustling around and stuff.  When you walk onto the set, it's just, there's one guy with a headset.  It's just so buttoned down, they know exactly what they're doing, that they're just one  guy.  Yeah, they just walk you through, and you're just standing there, and you're like, okay,  you're going to be on as soon as she calls your name.  All right.  And you're like, oh, all right.  Like there's no event, there's no like big thing, and then she's just like, let's hear  for Tom Baba!  That's like the, that's the hardest like moment.  Weird.  It's like waiting, and then, you know, it's like, oh, time to walk out. 
[01:39:00]  Because you're just like, I think I'm going to die.  Like, I think I'm going to be like, they're going to be showing me dying on the news,  like just falling down, because I couldn't take the excitement and nerves.  Right, just completely caving.  Yeah.  I always think that.  You just lose it.  Like, what if I just collapsed right now?  It's like, it would be all over the news.  Yeah, Tom Baba collapses.  Here's just over and over on the news.  And a tragic moment caught live on tape as a, oh, no. 
[01:39:30]  Like a jellyfish.  I hate walking out, because you're always so self-conscious of the fact that you're walking.  You're like, your arms are spinning.  You're like, I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking.  I'm walking, I'm walking.  It's so humiliating.  I'm walking, I'm walking.  My arm left step.  My shoes are going up and down.  My shoes are going up and down.  Did you tell her that you had no deal on?  No, I didn't tell her anything.  Oh, you should have told her.  You should have said, look, I'm sorry if I stink. 
[01:40:00]  Well, that's the thing that made it even more nerve-wracking.  It's like, if you go on anything as a comedian, you can just make jokes and stuff.  You're going into her church.  There is nothing, no tool in my bag that I can really use.  I don't know if I'm going to be accepted.  I'm going into this giant church.  You've already had the hug problem.  I've had the hug problem.  And I don't know, it's all women from the Midwest and wherever.  That's your audience.  It kind of actually is.  But, you know what I mean? 
[01:40:30]  Like, there's no, like, I'm going to kind of go out there and if I can walk in here and  be like, dudes, I was sweating, I got no deodorant, we all laugh about it there.  You're just, like, pretending that it's not happening.  It's like, yeah, oh, I had no deodorant, I'm sweating, and just a silence and a bunch  of, like, staring women like, ew, I don't like this man.  But then you've got to be a comic and you've got to go, hey, well, who's shitting your  mouths?  Just can't acknowledge it on the Oprah.  Well, you could, though, if you said that your wife packed and she didn't put deodorant 
[01:41:00]  to your, you know, people would probably enjoy that, because it's like, everybody is packed.  Wrong, no?  Not them.  You just had a, Tom Pop on Twitter, you had a fine tweet, too, it says, in a death cab  heading to see the fine gentleman at Opie and Anthony.  Oh.  And Jim Morton.  And Jim Morton.  And Jim Morton.  Death cab?  What's the death cab all about?  Every once in a while, we do get a death cab.  Yes.  It is brutal.  I just, I don't, you know what it is, it was one of those.  Where were you coming from?  From 10th Street.  All right.  Straight up 6th.  Pretty far ride.  And. 
[01:41:30]  For Manhattan.  This, it was one of those, um, cash cab?  No, the little SUV ones, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  They're the worst.  They're just so tight, there's no room in it.  Tiny.  I don't like those.  I like the minivan.  Just all the stretch it out.  I liked the old school taxi, like the show Taxi, those, where you'd get in the back seat  and you'd have, like, leg room, like first class.  Yeah, and those little pop-up seats.  You could fit a steamer trunk in the fucking bag.  It's like the good old days.  Yeah, it's so big, you could run a marathon in it.  Yeah, Chip.  Yay, Chip's here. 
[01:42:00]  Was it one of the cabs that turns off at every stoplight?  Uh, stoplight?  He was just gunning it, like, 90 miles an hour, and then jamming on his brakes and cursing  at everyone, and I'm feeling nauseous.  Yeah, you get that nausea.  They don't understand when you're stopping and starting like that, unless you're driving.  No, they understand.  They're like, tip this.  They've been driving for 20 straight hours, and they're like, you know what, I'm miserable,  so I'm going to make everyone miserable.  Fuck you.  You look like you're going someplace important that's going to make you money, so screw you.  Be green when you have to go in and see people.  You're trying to pitch something, and you're fucking green. 
[01:42:30]  Right, exactly.  You're trying to vomit.  Well, that's what they were hoping for.  He just puts it in from driving to hauling middle-class white guy.  And it just beats the shit out of you the whole way.  So what was it?  A lot of stop and go.  A lot of stop and go.  Heavy on the brake and all that bullshit.  And screaming at everybody.  Just screaming.  And it's like you drive a cab.  Yeah, that's your job.  How are you surprised that people in New York are cutting you off?  And believe me, you should just be used to it, right?  Yeah, just screaming. 
[01:43:00]  And they're the worst.  They are the worst.  And they're the worst when you're driving.  It caused most of the problems.  He was.  He was the most reckless thing.  Then you're buckling in, and now you're more nauseous because I'm pinned to the thing.  It was a deaf cab.  Yeah, that's the old school cab.  Big space.  Oh, those big boys, yeah.  It's like Roger Rabbit cabs.  Remember that era, though, in New York?  That was like the dirty New York.  I always think, when I think of that era in New York, I think of the opening credits to 
[01:43:30]  The Odd Couple.  Yeah.  Like that.  They show Times Square, and it's like chock full of nutses on every corner.  That smoke coming out.  Buses is just black smoke fucking coming out of everything.  Corrupt cops just beating people with billy clubs.  It was a wonderful time.  It really was.  It had character.  Yes.  We call it having character.  And there's fucking, you know, Oscar Madison. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  Just walking around eating a sandwich and shit.  Look at that.  The old days.  The big old station wagon from Jersey.  Yeah, the wood-sided station wagon.  He's smoking anywhere.  Oh, so great.  Yeah, and he just, everyone fit in.  Everyone looked, no one looked good.  No, every, look at this.  There's a hooker walking down the street.  There's no handicapped ramps off the sidewalks.  There's no people walking quickly to make money.  No.  That is like the old school New York cement. 
[01:44:30]  With cement.  Just the hustle and bustle.  What a good opening for a show, right?  No one's on, yeah.  He just throws the money on the front seat when he leaves the cab.  He's eating a hot dog by the park.  No one's working out.  No one's on his cell phone.  No one on rollerblades or jogging.  No.  What is that, a Maypole event?  Oh, yeah, they're doing that dance with little Sasha.  It's so funny about a park.  No one's working out. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, throw your trash on the ground.  He's just throwing his trash.  Yeah, he throws his dog at the watch.  That's on 6th Avenue.  That's right around the, that's probably next door.  That's the Apple Store.  It is really cool.  That's right near the Apple Store.  Oh, that was.  Yeah.  It is cool to watch those things and see, like, what was there at the time and then  realize, holy shit, that's where that is, or that's still there, or that's long gone.  Taxi Driver had that great scene in the diner where it's right by Columbus Circle.  It's that building that had the odd windows and stuff, and they pass by that, and you're 
[01:45:30]  like, fuck, that's still there.  Yeah.  It's great.  That's what's so great about New York.  Yeah, yeah.  That is the cool part.  It's like, it's like a giant movie set.  You walk around like a back lot.  Right.  Exactly.  That's from that movie, and that, yeah.  In the King of Comedy, there's a cool scene where Sandra Bernhardt and De Niro, Bobby D,  are outside this building on Broadway, and they're trying to cross from Caroline's.  Yeah, cross street from Caroline's.  Oh, yeah.  That's what the chock full of nuts thing is.  Chock full of nuts on every corner.  That was like Starbucks back in the day.  Yeah, Danny, I'm on with you on this. 
[01:46:00]  That's what they call this, man.  Danny left his post to check out some juice.  She's very pretty.  Holy shit.  She's the ebony princess of Sirius Satellite Radio.  I didn't know my wife was here.  She's so hot.  She's so fucking hot.  She really is hot.  The bitch's name is Buttercup Jones.  That's some cool 70s over there.  She shakes it when she moves, man.  You'll be a butterscotch.  But if you're an intern, you got to walk like that.  Yeah.  There's no other reason to be here.  A little fucking bop. 
[01:46:30]  Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.  I said something like to her, like I was trying to have a line.  I'm like, do you want some cum with that shake?  Oh, how'd that go?  Not good.  No, not good.  I got pulled into like person resources.  You know I'm a fan of Chip, but when Chip goes dirty, it gets uncomfortable.  Yeah, but a little blue.  Who's Chip?  What's that?  What's that?  You don't know Chip?  What's that?  I've never acknowledged him.  He'll never acknowledge him.  Yes, he will.  I have not acknowledged him in over a year.  Really?  Not at once.  Not at once.  Where'd you get your shirt from? 
[01:47:00]  He has a Roebuck tie-us?  When we're hanging out, everyone hates Chip so much, and I just keep going, yay, Chip!  Yay!  I love Chip!  It drives Colin crazy.  I say, will you stop it?  You're encouraging.  I'm going to Chip.  He bites his hand.  He's encouraging.  Colin does love Chip, though.  Yeah.  He really does.  He's really turned.  What has he been doing with the movie reviews?  Hilarious.  He is hysterical.  Oh, hilarious.  He's been watching, I guess, a lot of Scorsese movies, and adding in his own. 
[01:47:30]  Colin's bored again.  Scorsese.  Scorsese might be a genius and all, but Colin knows what would make these movies better.  It's so great.  And that's what he's been adding.  The Goodfellas thing, when he said, what's with the scene walking into the restaurant?  They should really cut it up and go from some different angles.  Yeah.  He's got all the ideas in directing and dialogue.  It's like he doesn't like the blue language in Casino and the violence.  Just making people angry.  It's so great. 
[01:48:00]  There's nothing better when you really get people on Twitter just go nuts.  Yeah, because people are like, dude, what are you talking about?  They don't get the joke.  They don't get that they're being moronic.  Here's one.  Mean Streets would have been better if they kept it PG on the language.  PG on the language.  Look, this is what...  Look, you see?  It's coming through.  It's like Oprah.  Wow.  You do fucking...  Only from this pit.  Let me see.  It's a sweating problem.  Only from the one...  You fucking other pit, too.  Well, this pit's...  Oh, wow.  Yeah, that's gone.  This one's really bad.  That's so bad.  You got deodorant on today? 
[01:48:30]  I do.  Oh, I forget.  Can you lift your arm?  Wow.  I got to get a shot of that.  Yeah.  I won't do anything.  Maybe he's got that half side thing where the one half sweats...  No, that's both sides.  I don't want to bring it up.  I can't find a deodorant that can battle with Papa Sweat.  You probably need that.  They sell like a prescription.  Yeah.  I'm serious.  I'm serious.  Because a friend of mine had a similar problem.  I had a girl that used to do that.  It's not a problem.  I knew a girl that used to fucking sweat like that.  Really?  I would have fucking cyber sex with her, and she would just talk about how...  Cyber sex?  She would talk about how fucking stinky... 
[01:49:00]  Cyber sex?  Cyber sex.  What year is this?  I haven't heard anybody say that word in a lot of times.  I haven't heard cyber sex.  I know what you meant, but I haven't heard cyber sex in seven years.  We had that intercourse on the World Wide Web.  That is really.  Wow.  Cyber sex.  Honestly, it was probably 2002.  2003.  That's nine years ago.  Fair enough.  And she would always fucking say, yeah, my pits are really stinky.  And I would be like, what?  My fucking...  My dick would just...  My zipper would actually just open itself and go, I know the drill. 
[01:49:30]  I'll take it from here.  I love that shit.  I love what you like when she is a stinker.  I love what...  No, but there's different body chemistry, but I like when a girl doesn't wear deodorant.  Oh, wow.  And a pit stink.  I completely understand.  She's coming back.  I do, too.  She's coming back.  I like a little bit.  Well, that was obvious.  That's what I...  We all just turned and looked out the fucking window.  She's going to wear a dress like that.  We're going to look.  You've got to actually point to something and go like this.  Like, if you look at the door, it's like that.  Good acting.  And then you just look.  Is she wearing a nightie today? 
[01:50:00]  She's wearing a teddy.  Is she?  Is that a nightie?  She's a teddy.  Yeah.  It's a Theanor!  They just send her on laps every hour.  Oh, they really do.  We'll walk through again.  Could you bring me ice one cup of time?  Yeah.  Please?  Go make the white people uncomfortable.  No, that's for morale, man.  That's...  Something's going on.  Holy cow.  We're not going to pay these guys anymore, but we'll give them something good to look at.  Give them some candy.  Right.  Some eye candy.  Whenever she starts walking down the hallway, you see it from the back, it's just Motown  starts playing in my head.  It's perfect like a...  Now, Ann, quandary for you? 
[01:50:30]  Because she's a black girl.  You usually don't go black, but she's pretty sexy.  I wouldn't mind seeing her naked and shit, but as far as being with her or any kind of  thing like that, I don't think I would.  I'm very selective with my racial makeup when I have some kind of intercourse.  Because of the conversation afterwards or because of the sexual attraction?  Yeah, it would probably be awkward after, like, ejaculating, and then you're both laying  there and have nothing in common.  Right.  Hey, that's great.  Oh, I paid my taxes. 
[01:51:00]  She'd be like, I don't know what he's talking about.  Here's how that conversation would go after they fucked.  She'd be cuddling up to them and go, do you really dislike black people?  You just say this.  Yeah, I do.  It's a character I play on the radio.  I'm really not that mild at home.  It's the way you like when a chick fucking pisses out a little bit.  Now leave, the police are on their way.  Yeah, I like that.  I like that smell.  I like that, too.  No deodorant, man.  Unless the chemistry's bad. 
[01:51:30]  If there's no body chemistry with a girl, I don't want to smell you.  You need the right pheromones?  You do, man.  But if I like a girl's chemical smell, I don't want you to...  Sometimes, I used to date this one girl...  I used to smell like a monkey cage.  Dude, I would fucking...  That's wonderful.  This one girl I would date was fucking...  I would tell her not to shower.  She wouldn't shower for two days.  And she would just come over and put her ass and pussy on my nose.  Wow.  Jimmy's trying to turn us on with that story. 
[01:52:00]  Two days?  Just put it on my nose.  Sometimes, yeah.  Two days is probably a good thing.  No deodorant?  You don't want to leave it any longer than that.  Yes, I would.  Come on, man.  Really?  Three, four days?  No, not four days.  Two days is rough.  No, I would.  Two days is rough.  I would go with three days.  Three days?  Three days?  I've had weekends...  That ass thing is weird.  I've had weekends, though, where you just spend in bed laying in both of your own filth,  sweat, cum, and you just fuck, and you go down on each other, and you just both...  No, you both stink.  Right.  So there's no, like, you're on equal footing. 
[01:52:30]  Right.  I don't mind that.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't mind that.  There was a girl that worked on my show, and then as the day would go on, everyone's  working, and she would get a little funky, and everyone hated it.  And I was, like, quietly, like, yeah, I hate it, too.  Yeah.  Come here.  Put this light bulb in over my face.  The pit's right in Tom Pompas' face.  Was she pretty?  Yeah.  I would turn me on so much.  I would tell her, just don't wear deodorant. 
[01:53:00]  Like, the girl I dated who wouldn't wear deodorant, I would always tell her, like, fucking...  She would, like, I can't.  I gotta go to work.  She would have to work.  I'd be so annoyed.  You fucking Ike Turner.  Dude, I would love that.  Fucking commanding women to do things.  No, but she likes...  I wanna wear deodorant.  No, no, no.  But then she did a thing with Phil Spector, and I raped her on the console.  And I punched her in the face.  I'm gonna be just like that puppy!  I should have just let my...  I should have taken my jacket off and shown Oprah my big saddlebags.  Maybe she would get turned on by that. 
[01:53:30]  She would have fucking just laughed at you.  Yeah.  Yeah, if they did a thing, I forgot my deodorant.  I'm so nervous, Tim, I forgot my deodorant.  At the end of the show, she came up and hugged me.  Oh, she did?  Oh, you won her over.  Yeah.  And she took me in.  You should have backed off.  And she, like, really squeezed me in and said really nice things.  Into her bosom.  Right into her bosoms.  Her bosom.  It was like a grandmother hug.  Yeah.  Big ones.  Big warm ones.  Yeah.  Huge.  They're huge.  They would have to be.  They're gigantic.  How is she off camera?  Different? 
[01:54:00]  No.  No.  But she's the boss.  Like, you feel like, oh, she's completely running this place.  She's firing people.  She's got a lot of people working for her.  People are afraid of her.  Really?  Yeah.  Is anybody disrespectful to her?  No.  What, are you kidding me?  No way.  No way.  Yeah, Oprah is a fucking, she's like an alpha male type of woman, you know?  Yeah.  And doesn't have to, she's so powerful that she doesn't have to say it or act it.  She just walks in and commands it.  You think someone like that has, like, a kind of a sick sense of, 
[01:54:30]  humor somewhere in her, where she's, like, alone?  Yes.  I don't, yeah, because it seems like she would only laugh at the wholesome things  and not want to, not want to hurt anyone's feelings.  But, you know, but I bet you there's, like, a dinner party and she's cranked up on some  wine with her friends.  Just getting off a little, yeah, yeah.  Letting loose.  Making some, yeah, making some jokes about gay people or something.  Handicapped people.  Yeah.  Gay jokes.  Gay handicapped people.  Yeah.  Yeah, fine.  I'm going to tell you this one.  You ever hear this joke?  She looks around and, right?  I'm Oprah, I can't be seen her. 
[01:55:00]  It'll be interesting now that it's all wrapped up.  Now the books will come out.  Yeah, the tell-alls.  Yeah, remember the time when we found that SWAT stick in her office?  She was goose-stepping around her office.  Yeah.  They've all signed non-disclosures, guaranteed.  She's too smart.  And they're all still working because now they're going to work for Rosie.  Yeah.  And that's probably Oprah's way of, you know, making sure her books come out.  Yeah.  Rosie's taking over.  In that same...  On Oprah's, on, uh...  Oh, I guess she's doing it for, uh...  Own.  Own, you're right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, for Oprah's channel.  No, it's...  You know what's funny? 
[01:55:30]  Oprah's producing it and it's actually in that space.  Yeah, but it's going to be on Own, which is different, which is funny because...  Uh, locally, they're going to go with a four o'clock newscast and they're all excited  like, you know, uh, Oprah's over, but we got plans.  It's going to be a bust.  It's going to be a four o'clock newscast.  It's going to be a bust.  Newscast.  That's how they're...  That's what their...  Scheduled news is the dumbest, most useless thing ever.  I have a theory.  You don't...  Yes.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  They know that for the first three months, a lot of people are going to be checking her  out in that time slot, so anybody in that slot is probably doomed to fail. 
[01:56:00]  So they may want to give a buffer in between 25 years of Oprah.  They call that the David Lee Roth.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You pop him in, wait a while.  But that might be it because news is nothing personal if it doesn't work and nobody cares  if you take it off.  Four o'clock news.  Who cares?  Four o'clock news.  But you know what I'm saying?  Why else do they do that?  We should start an afternoon chat show.  I already have one.  Ah, yes.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  What's your chat show called?  It's called Jim Norton Chats, but I spell it with a Z instead of S, the N. 
[01:56:30]  That sounds good.  Most people know it's going to be a little silly.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Serious, but a little silly.  You want to read more of these Colin Quinn tweets?  Because they're great.  Yeah.  I told Colin last night, I said, I know what you're doing on Twitter, and it still makes  me angry.  Yeah, you're not fooling anyone.  That's very funny.  He wrote this one.  If you want to see a real New York movie, because we were talking about New York and  the scenery, check out the episode of Friends where Phoebe plays outside of Central Park.  I know that street. 
[01:57:00]  And then it's Goodfellas.  It's just an ass.  I love it.  Goodfellas had one flaw.  No way a guy would kill another guy over a nasty remark.  People get silly when they drink, but that is overdoing it.  It's great, because he really makes people angry.  They start screaming.  Yeah, they start screaming.  What are you talking about?  Someone would kill somebody.  We know.  You moron.  Idiot.  And then he just writes, Carlito's way, definitely Scorsese's at his finest.  I agree.  Him and Pacino made a lot of great ones together.  The obvious Colin. 
[01:57:30]  Colin without him being on Broadway anymore.  Yeah, that's what it is.  He's just sitting home tweeting in his fucking PJs.  You know it's creepy, because we know him a little bit.  We know he's bored, and he's waiting for his next project.  Rumble in the Bronx was shot entirely in the Bronx, as you can tell by the background.  Truly a serious look at the burrow.  The burrow.  Truly.  Which I think, where was that shot?  Toronto or something?  I don't know.  Or Japan.  Or Japan. 
[01:58:00]  It absolutely wasn't the Bronx.  Hilarious.  So the marriage reference, the plug starts.  Season two starts Sunday, June 26th.  We have to.  Like it's a chore for us.  That's a ways away, though.  Yeah.  This marriage reference.  Oh, June 26th.  Jesus.  Yeah.  A month away.  It'll be on Sundays all summer.  Wait a minute.  You're going to be in Chicago.  No, I'm not.  July.  Oh, July 14th through 16th.  Okay.  I thought that was.  That's wrong.  Is it?  Yeah.  What do you got on the marriage reference?  I'm going to be at Gotham next weekend. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, there you go.  All right.  Gotham comedy here in New York on 23rd Street.  That's the Bronx.  Danny just pulled up a still.  I think I see like fucking Mount Fuji.  Yeah, that's hilarious.  Mount Fuji is in the background.  Yeah.  It really mountains.  It's like fucking there's mountains in the Bronx.  Those are like snow-capped mountains.  That's hilarious.  Yeah, rumble in the Bronx.  The marriage ref.  So who's going to be on this season there?  Tom Papa?  Our first one will be Seinfeld, Ricky Gervais, and Julianne Moore. 
[01:59:00]  Wow.  Nice.  The next one is Tracy Morgan and Regis.  Oh, my God.  They're awesome together.  Could I get a word in over here, Tracy?  He won't shut his mouth.  I was yelling.  Regis, you're going to be pregnant.  Everyone's got to get pregnant.  You're going to have my baby.  Everyone's got to have Tracy's baby.  I can't.  I have your baby.  It's impossible.  Stupid Regis.  They really like each other.  You like Regis?  Yeah.  They really, really like each other. 
[01:59:30]  I see Regis a lot.  Oh, yeah.  He's a grumpy old man when he's not on TV.  Oh, really?  Fuck yeah.  Really?  He looks miserable.  What's he going to do when he retires?  He works out at my gym.  Really?  He walks the neighborhood, and he's a miserable guy.  He works out in your gym?  Yeah, and he's miserable.  That's good.  He doesn't talk to anyone, and he's not a nice man.  Wow.  I am going on record and saying...  Wow.  He seems so delightful.  Yeah.  I'm amazed.  I'm amazed.  The old curmudgeon.  Yeah.  My point, I'm amazed it's the same person. 
[02:00:00]  I'm amazed it's the same person.  Wow.  I can't believe it's the same guy.  Just cranky.  As soon as those fucking cameras go on, though, man, he comes to life.  I'm dying.  Yeah.  That's why he's cranky.  He doesn't smile.  Wow.  And he's with people he knows, by the way, so it's not like he's doing this because he's  being bothered.  No one's bothering him whatsoever.  He's just...  Maybe he's just in deep thought.  No.  Sure.  Not every day.  Everything's about Notre Dame.  Fighting Irish.  I agree. 
[02:00:30]  I love Dean.  Dino.  And you don't get that at all, by the way.  Very monotone.  Very serious.  What a bummer.  Not one smile.  I've seen him so many fucking times.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  That's too bad.  Not animated at all.  Can he lift?  Yeah, I was going to say, what is he benching?  Yeah, what's he benching over there?  Honestly, for what?  He's in his 70s, right?  Pushing...  Is he pushing 80?  He's got to be.  Regis is...  He does all right, man.  74.  8'33".  That's the time.  33 is...  Oh. 
[02:01:00]  I was going to do the math.  67 plus another one.  Wow.  And we got Bill Maher's on it this year.  Bill Maher and Mary J. Blige and some cool people.  And Bill Maher.  Bill Maher.  I actually liked that one movie he did, though.  Religulous was fun, man.  It was an all right movie.  Religulous was good.  And he went after the Muslims.  I just don't like him as a person.  I just don't like his fucking politics, his bullshit liberal crapola. 
[02:01:30]  He's smart.  I call it crapola.  I can see you guys getting off terrific.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Just fucking swimmingly.  Yeah.  You should have done this?  No.  Fucking season two of The Marriage Ref, though, starts Sunday, June 26th at 10 p.m.  Very cool.  Yeah, it'll be fun.  Nine weeks.  A little more TV.  A little more TV.  I don't follow.  Does he have a Twitter?  Bill Maher.  Tom Papa.  Oh.  Yeah.  Tom Papa has a Twitter at Tom Papa.  Oh, well, yeah.  Bill Maher does. 
[02:02:00]  I don't know.  He does.  I would assume he does, but I don't follow that, but I follow Michael Moore, and I don't  know why.  I wouldn't follow him.  Like, why am I...  I sit there, and every time one of his tweets go by, I'm just like, God, fuck you!  And I'm like, why am I making myself more?  Because he was fun on the show.  Back to your phone, exactly.  Yeah, he was fun on the show.  He's a cool guy in person.  But then when you read his tweets, I'm just like, it's the opposite of everything I believe  in.  And you challenged him, and it was great back and forth, you and Michael Moore.  Well, the thing is, we brought up a subject... 
[02:02:30]  Next time, I think it'll be different with you and him.  But it was one subject that we brought up that we all kind of agreed on...  That's true.  ...on something, so it wasn't really a confrontational subject that we have, like gun control or  something.  Yeah, yeah.  Or fucking, you know, the rich are the most evil motherfuckers on the planet.  Man, what's Michael Moore's Twitter?  Because now I want to see if he...  It's got...  Dick...  At DickFuckFaceEd.  My head.  No?  At DickFuckFaceEd.  There is something, though... 
[02:03:00]  There is something about following people that drive you crazy.  That you hate.  Right, right.  You can't do a lot of them, but a small dose is like, oh, there's Colin, that's fun, that's  fun.  Ah, I hate you!  I like a little, you know, dynamic.  I do love the aspect of just the block.  Just like...  No.  We always talk about the joy of the block.  It's so great.  I don't think it's right to block people, Tom Potter.  Oh, right.  My favorite blockage...  You're right.  I should reconsider.  My favorite blockage of people is when you notice they only have like two followers. 
[02:03:30]  That's exactly right.  And they bash you.  Right.  Now, all you do is send a private message to them.  Right.  And send like, oh, your two followers, not even worth retweeting this.  You're getting a private message because you're an asshole.  And now you're just blocked, so don't even bother trying to write back because I won't  read it.  Click.  Send.  Block.  Gone.  That's really...  That's not right.  It is a cheat.  No, it's not right.  You don't like that?  It's a little cold.  It is a little cold. 
[02:04:00]  Maybe he's just having a rough time.  Yeah.  Maybe he was in a death cab before he tweeted.  Yeah, it could have been.  He was a little nauseous.  I'm nauseous in the death cab.  Bill Maher, I have weird feelings.  I don't agree with his politics, but I like one thing he said when the Iraq war was happening.  He was saying that there was no weapons of mass destruction.  And he looks back and he goes, you know, the U.S., we have some egg on it.  We should put Saddam back where he was.  We would have egg on our face.  And he was basically bashing the U.S.  But after seeing what has happened since then, I agree that Saddam should have been put back. 
[02:04:30]  We would have been embarrassed.  But you know what?  Maybe my motives are different, but he knew how to handle those fucking people.  Exactly.  And the more I look at the whole thing over there, I'm completely against us being there.  And I was wrong to be for it.  But he's still a smug-ass man.  Oh, dude, without a doubt.  That's the problem.  But looking back on that, he got a lot of shit for that, but I do agree with that in hindsight.  How could you possibly do that, though?  Lives were lost, and then you just go, ah, fuck it. 
[02:05:00]  It's like people didn't like when Clinton cut and run from fucking Somalia after they took a beating.  If lives are lost in a war that is supposedly justified, and then you just decide, ah, put it back the way it was, we're leaving.  It's like all those people die in vain without any even inkling that you were trying.  You can't go back, but he should have been the leader all the time.  He never should have been taken out.  We're going to give your people freedom.  And he was like, have you met them? 
[02:05:30]  Animals.  I know these fuckers.  You're right.  Trust me.  This is the way to do it.  It is kind of like we went like, hey, free all the tigers from all the zoos and let them just walk around.  They want to be free.  Let them go.  Yeah, but nah, they kind of need a-  Well, we kind of figured this out a long time ago.  Feeding time.  Cages.  Balls of food.  Yeah.  He really did know how to handle his people, and sometimes it meant, you know, gassing a bunch of curds.  Right.  You know, he knew about- 
[02:06:00]  And murdering some way.  Yeah.  Oh, no, you didn't.  I certainly did.  Again, you forgot how to do the chip voice, I guess.  No, that was a Jimby.  A Jimby.  No, I agree with the sentiment, I should say, behind it.  Yeah, the sentiment.  Right.  Well, in hindsight, though, it's easy to agree with that sentiment, because you realize, like, it's kind of a Kobayashi Maru, a little no-wins scenario.  Yum, yum.  Yes.  But you didn't realize that until we were in a little too deep already. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  It's kind of hard to just cut and run it.  I can't find-  I remember when they were rolling across the desert.  Oh, God.  And my friend called me, he goes, oh, I hope they better find something.  They better find something.  And that, by the way, as we talk about this a lot, is why we don't believe in any conspiracy theories, because why wouldn't they just plant some fucking 55-gallon drums or some shit?  How easy would that have been?  It would have been so easy.  So easy.  They controlled everything.  That's right.  For miles, you couldn't get around.  It was a military fucking operation going on. 
[02:07:00]  They could have just dragged in whatever the fuck they want, planted.  Look what we found, this lion sack of shit.  Exactly.  That Hans Blix was a fucking asshole.  He couldn't find shit.  But he actually believed, he was very against U.S. policy, but he did believe that Saddam had weapons.  Yeah, where he believed that Saddam wanted people to think he had weapons.  Like, he thinks that Saddam was bluffing, but he really was.  Like, he thought Saddam had them or wanted people to believe he had them.  It was much too personal with Saddam.  Much too personal between Bush and Saddam. 
[02:07:30]  It would have been better.  He was so watched.  There was still a no-fly zone over his fucking country.  Which is nice if you're eating outdoors.  No, not those.  You couldn't fly planes, silly.  Oh, I thought.  Not the insects.  Oh, I thought there was, okay, no pretty girls.  No, that's.  You're in the 90s.  Early.  With your cyber sexes.  Yeah, cyber sexing.  No kidding, play hairdo zone.  He really was one of the most monitored dictators.  Yeah. 
[02:08:00]  So he was being kept in check.  But we really, yeah, but then again, he refused to castle.  That's why he was.  Oh, oh, oh.  Well, it's just pouring him out.  Oh, no.  It's easier to take in the chip voice.  It's wonderful.  It's wonderful.  Who's chip?  He was kept in check.  There was no way he could have done anything.  So just leave him there.  Yeah.  But we all, and I'm guilty of the same thing.  We all had this bloodlust at the time.  Like, you know what?  Someone's got to pay.  Go in there.  Fuck, someone's got to pay. 
[02:08:30]  Exactly.  I don't care who it is.  I know.  You know, it's like when Tony Manero and his friends took the car and drove into the Spix bar.  You know?  You know?  Him and Double J and everybody.  And then you realize, maybe it wasn't them that did it.  But someone had to pay.  Right.  Yeah.  I know.  We were pissed.  It's just like it, by the way.  We were pissed.  Yes.  But what about Gaddafi?  Like, why are you...  That is beyond me.  He kept his people in line.  You know, it's nice to give people freedom, but you don't know who you're really giving the freedom to. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  That's not what it's about.  Here's what Gaddafi's about.  The U.S. is fucking embarrassed that that Pan Am bomber was released back to...  But that's not the U.S.'s fault.  It's pretty much fucking England's fault.  Scotland, technically.  But I'm telling you, we can't go after Scotland, and we don't have the fucking balls.  We don't have the fucking balls to say anything harsh to England or harsh to Scotland.  So, we want to remove Gaddafi, because we're embarrassed that that fucking Al, whatever his name was, whoever the fucking Pan Am bomber was, and they celebrated. 
[02:09:30]  That's the punishment.  Yes, yeah.  And he's still alive.  Right.  If we wanted Gaddafi, we should have got him fucking 1985.  Yeah.  We should have killed him.  Reagan tried.  Reagan did try, but too bad for us.  Yes.  Don't fucking cry about little bitches about it now.  You know what's fucked up about...  We're taking it out on Scotland.  But the fucked up thing with that situation is the U.N., of course, is in there.  It's not America.  But meanwhile, it's all American equipment. 
[02:10:00]  That's our ship.  Yeah, yeah.  But they're trying to remove...  Not trying to remove him, they say.  They're just keeping the civilian deaths down by bombing his army.  That is attacking the civilians.  Meanwhile, by civilian, you mean the people that are shooting at his army trying to kill him and remove him from power.  So, believe me, I'm no fan of Gaddafi, but don't bullshit me and tell me he's saving little women and children that are being shot in the streets.  There's an insurrection happening. 
[02:10:30]  Right.  It's a war.  There's people fighting him.  Yeah.  Those aren't civilians at that point.  They're revolutionaries.  They're insurgents to Gaddafi.  They're the other side of the war.  The other side of the war.  So, oh, we're saving civilians that are fucking firing anti-aircraft guns at Gaddafi's planes.  Yeah.  So, you're supporting one side of a revolution.  Yeah, exactly.  But they don't want to put it like that.  It's a humanitarian effort, really?  Right.  Like it was in Mogadishu.  It's not our fucking...  I'm sorry, in Somalia.  No, it's true.  It's not our fucking business. 
[02:11:00]  Right.  These are the same people that cheered when the bomber came home.  Enough.  Yeah.  It's like Syria is really...  Everyone's kind of saying that we should be doing the same thing in Syria.  But no, we should be doing the same thing in Syria that we're doing with Gaddafi.  Just back off.  It's not your business.  It's not our business.  He's killing people.  It's brutal.  We understand that.  It's not our fight.  But that's the...  And that's the world, you know?  It's like there are dictators.  There are democracies.  There are fucking totalitarian fucking nutjobs.  Right.  But like, you can't make the world this pleasant place. 
[02:11:30]  We're going to give you democracy.  Yeah.  It's just as bad as when the Soviet Union was trying to just, hey, you're communists now.  Yeah.  Like, who the fuck are we to go barging around thinking we're going to lay democracy on people  that don't even know what it means?  Well, before you know it, you'll have the full apparatus of totalitarianism.  Of totalitarianism.  Totalitarianism.  It'll be led.  Push.  Jesus.  Remember that guy?  Clockwork.  When he's on the phone.  That's great.  You have the full apparatus of totalitarianism.  Sometimes it must be led. 
[02:12:00]  Push.  Push.  We had Malcolm McDowell yesterday.  I know.  I love it.  I saw your tweet last night of the Jim taking all his posters out.  All the video.  Yeah, that was great.  Nervous Jimmy.  Nervous Jimmy.  I just don't want to fucking mind anyone else's business anymore.  I'm sick of it.  We really should have.  I'm sick of our moral policing and our fucking self-righteous shit.  It drives me nuts.  Yeah, especially right now.  Like, the whole Midwest, by the way, is just being creamed with tornadoes.  Yeah.  And I don't see, like, a tenth of the shit I see for Haiti relief or any time there's a 
[02:12:30]  disaster.  Anywhere else in the world, there's, like, celebrities text this to this number and give,  like, ten bucks to that.  And meanwhile, there's not shit to give to our own people that are fucking ravaged.  It's ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  Every time I...  Schools.  Just schools.  Schools in New York are broke.  Yeah, broke-ass broke schools.  Unless the parents in public schools, you have to donate all this money just to get, like,  art class.  I mean, broke. 
[02:13:00]  And then to watch every day in the news, we're going to send 30 billion to this country.  We're going to send 20 billion.  And we're building schools.  Wait, so how do you tell me that we don't have money for us?  I don't understand it.  Why are we building schools in the Sudan?  Right.  Yeah.  And the school system is going a la carte now, too.  Yeah.  You read about that?  You completely...  If you want to do a sport, it's going to cost you.  If you want to do a little art or music, it's going to cost you.  It's ridiculous.  They're going a la carte in some of these districts.  Wow.  Our kids are in public school in New York right now.  Is that bad?  Because I'm behind you here. 
[02:13:30]  It's good, but you've got to start knowing.  You have to pick out the schools where the rich people live because they all donate money  and have these fundraisers.  It's kind of like...  Good public schools are semi-private now.  Like, you really have to...  Yeah, yeah.  You have to give them a couple grand every once in a while.  Did you feel the pressure of going to private school?  Because I'm already feeling that.  People are going, oh, you better go private with your kid.  I'm like, my kid's won.  Yeah.  No, you don't have to do that.  No, and someone said to me recently, they said, it's too late already.  You were supposed to pick a school already.  I'm like, he's won.  Yeah, no, that's ridiculous. 
[02:14:00]  I'll move to the suburbs before I worry about that shit.  No, that culture is completely insane.  You can do it.  So is your kid in a...  How many kids you got?  Two.  Charter school or...  No, it's a...  It is public school.  It's a regular school.  Public school.  But it's good.  And all the parents...  You just...  You'll...  When you start looking into it, there's some schools that are great.  And there's like one down the street that's brutal.  And the parents don't have the money, you know.  Why public school and not private?  Why?  Because...  How do you explain it?  It makes sense.  If you pick a public school in a really rich neighborhood, they're taking care of their 
[02:14:30]  own school.  I don't...  They're doing the fundraising.  No, but he can afford privates.  It's a decision for some reason.  I know you just have money.  I don't like the culture.  Oh, okay.  There is an elitist, snobby, douchebag parent thing that you get involved in.  And the kids are shitty because the parents are shitty.  I always think that...  It's gross.  I think that type of school raises kids into the guys that are always the bad guy in the  comedy movies.  Yeah.  Like where it's the rich guy, and he's got the girl, and the piece of shit guy is in 
[02:15:00]  love with the girl, and they hook up at the end because the rich guy is such a douche.  The rich guy is a douchebag.  Like that seems to be what gets raised in those schools.  Completely.  It really...  That bad guy.  Yeah.  I heard someone was telling me last night that they were saying that there's a generation  of kids that are all raised now.  I went with Pretty and Pink myself.  I went with Pretty and Pink when he was doing that.  The kids who are doing really well are really, really rich kids. 
[02:15:30]  And it's because they're being raised by the nannies.  Oh, right.  They're being raised by Jamaicans and Dominicans.  Low income.  Low income.  Just real people.  You don't do that.  And just real.  Those kids are great.  Disciplined the way they're supposed to be.  The ones who are kind of rich, who the parents are really involved, those kids are all douche  boys.  They get fucked up.  I live on the Upper West.  I do not see parents with kids ever.  Ever.  I mean ever.  Ever.  Not just during the day.  Ever.  How many black mothers are having white children? 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  It's true.  What's going on?  No, it's completely the way it goes.  It is really strange.  No one raises their own kids.  Having a kid in Manhattan is like having an accessory.  It's an accessory to these women.  Everyone else is doing it.  They hang out with them a little bit just to show them off.  And they're like, all right, here.  Yeah.  And they give them back to their nannies.  It's gross.  Ours is like a public school.  It's like how we grew up.  It's just real people, real schools.  There's no bullshit.  And education's great.  And it's just real people.  It's like real working class people. 
[02:16:30]  But your point being that, yeah, we're not even taking care of our own school system,  but giving money everywhere else.  Every day.  Billions.  Did you see the documentary Waiting for Superman?  Yeah.  You did.  Yeah.  Because it sounds like you're describing it.  Is it good?  I loved it.  It is amazing.  It's really amazing.  It shows you what the fuck's going on with school systems in this country.  Is that what Lex Luthor did or something?  No.  Yep.  God.  Waiting for Superman was great.  Who's that teacher?  Who's the guy from the Bronx?  Yeah, I don't know his name, but he started a truck. 
[02:17:00]  Jackie Chan.  This guy.  He's amazing.  He's going to change schools.  Joe Brown.  All right.  No.  Here's a good one.  I'll talk about it off air.  Oh, Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris.  No.  No.  They're changing the school system.  Who's changing the school system?  Long Island's got an odd system out there.  I guess we have to pay school taxes.  Even if you don't have kids?  Even if you don't have kids. 
[02:17:30]  How else are they supposed to get there?  Mine are the highest in the country.  Really?  And I don't have fucking kids.  Well, you train your kids better then.  Then you should get some of the benefits of the kids.  I was saying.  I should be on your lawn.  I'm going and picking shoes.  Fuck, cut the lawn.  I'm going to the high school and picking out some girls for the pool.  Waiting for Superman shows that a lot of these kids are just fucked as soon as they come out of the womb, man.  Completely screwed.  Because they're in a school district where the teachers suck.  They don't want to put the time in. 
[02:18:00]  So they're just fucking babysitting the kids.  And if the kids are passing, they're not passing on a level that is equivalent to the other schools out there in America.  Completely.  So this fucking guy, he started a charter school in the middle of Harlem.  Yeah.  And it's.  He broke out of the system, the public school system, and did it his own way.  And people are like, you're just screwed.  You can't.  You're not going to can't teach.  You can't change this.  And all of his kids are now going to college and he's just kicking ass.  Right.  Because he's just thinking.  And it's in the middle of Harlem where you don't really expect a good school system. 
[02:18:30]  He's kicking ass.  And that's the way it can be done.  But not when you're sending billions of dollars.  Right.  Overseas.  That's only one.  That's one success story.  But there's a lot of disasters.  The whole policy of this country to just, for some reason, how did we become the guys that just ship boatloads of fucking money out of the country when.  It makes no sense.  And then on the other hand, we're talking about, oh my God, look at the deficit.  We've got to print more money.  It's like, then don't send any out.  Let's just, right.  Let's just stop spending.  Let's collect all the credit cards. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  Let's bring them all.  Let's cut them up.  And just live in our house for a while.  Yeah.  They preach like, you know, oh boy, watch your credit and this and that.  Meanwhile, they're doing the exact thing.  They're overspending.  They're like a bitch that just got her fucking credit card.  And they're forgiving debt.  They fucking crucify us on 30% for a credit card or whatever, but they fucking forgive foreign debt all the time.  Yeah, forgive foreign debt.  To get favors in the UN.  Yep.  It's fucking sickening.  It's weird.  And we're giving more money to Egypt now.  They just voted to get more money.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Give more money.  Maybe we just don't understand.  I get it.  Maybe we don't understand the big picture. 
[02:19:30]  We don't see the big picture.  That's the big picture.  They're bribing these shit countries.  And Mubarak's got to face charges now because he had protesters killed.  They're putting him on trial.  We can't see the forest for the trees or something.  Cybersex.  What?  Cybersex.  Dude, she was just saying to me, they're stinky today.  He never left that.  He never left that thought.  Someone's going to think the show skipped.  Jimmy needs to jerk off and then he can move past that thought.  She would say they're stinky today. 
[02:20:00]  And I would say how I was going to lay back and she was going to put them over my face.  Oh, do you like that?  And I would clean them with my mouth.  Oh.  It was fucking so hot and dirty.  Some guy said, I don't want a girl that smells like a man.  It's like, no.  That's not it.  She smells like a girl.  She smells like a girl.  But that's a specific thing.  She smells like an animal.  That guy probably doesn't eat pussy well either.  That guy probably, when a girl is like, she walks in the house, he's probably like,  I'll eat your ass if you hop in the shower.  Really?  Really?  You fucking rookie.  Here's a brush.  Yeah.  Really?  Clean uniform on the sidelines? 
[02:20:30]  You belong in single A ball.  You're not ready for the fucking big leagues.  I don't want to play football.  It's rainy.  I'll get mud on my shoes.  Oh, wow.  You fucking twat.  Get in there.  Man up.  I'm going to need a towel, coach.  Yeah.  I would hide my girlfriend's deodorant.  I used to hide it.  Wow, really?  I really would.  Yeah, but she'd stay over.  I would fucking hide her deodorant.  You're going to reek today.  That is really...  I understand what you're saying, but you take it up a few levels.  I was just thinking the same thing. 
[02:21:00]  I have the complete attraction, the animal smell, the whole thing, and then put her ass  on my nose and I'm out.  Well, that's because you're the U.S. military.  You don't really want to commit, Tom.  What do you want?  Troops?  You just stand there.  That's the Korea situation.  Jimmy has a way of always losing you.  You can be with him for a little while and then he always takes it once back.  And we're like, all right, I'm out.  All right, he did.  I'm out.  He's got to have pocket aces.  I'm done.  Jimmy always gets to his destination on an empty bus.  It's like it starts off where we're like, yeah, I'm along with our... 
[02:21:30]  All right.  All right.  Let me pull the string.  Yeah, I'm done.  I got to get out.  I'm all here.  This is my stop.  This doesn't look like your stop.  It is now.  I'll walk the rest of the way.  But I'll tell you, the woman on that bus...  For me, hiding the deodorant is like...  That's just like...  You're committed a little too much.  Sneaking your deodorant.  But the woman that stays on the bus for the entire ride has fucking great smelling pits  and a deep ass crack.  A tucked in blue uniform. 
[02:22:00]  Dude, I love it.  Butt stretching.  Listen.  We should take a break because we got Bernard Hopkins.  I got soup.  He's got soup.  We got leaks to do.  Yes.  Bernard Hopkins just won.  Fuck.  Oldest fighter to do that, right?  Yeah.  46 years old.  Did he win at...  He's done our show a few times, Tom.  He's cool.  He's a great guy.  You're going to have fun with him.  And he's...  I think he...  What was the weight he fought at?  Was it 175?  I don't know, Jimmy.  How did he do anything at 46?  Yeah, he's amazing. 
[02:22:30]  Like bad.  Really?  Punched in the face.  Amazing athlete.  You can't run for a bus at 46.  He's an amazing athlete, this guy.  All right.  So he'll be in about 10, 15 minutes.  Yeah.  So by the time we get back...  And let's get the big plug.  Tom, you're staying, right?  Yeah, I'm going to stay.  Oh, good.  Season two of The Marriage Refs starts Sunday, June 26th at 10 p.m.  And then airs for the following nine weeks.  And it's Tom Papa on Twitter.  Yay.  We'll continue.  The OV and Anthony Show.  Beat it in three.  On the virus.  Sirius XM. 
[02:23:00]  Three days.  We got Tom Papa in the studio.  Yeah!  I like how Tom fits in with this show.  I don't like it at all.  I miss you guys.  I kind of like it.  I'll be honest.  When you started coming around, I wasn't sure you were going to work.  Just because he seems very...  Queer.  Queer?  But he's got an edge to him.  Because we see him hanging out with Seinfeld and doing the marriage reference stuff.  And, you know, going on Oprah.  A little reserved.  But you learn quickly that Tom Papa certainly is not. 
[02:23:30]  The psychopath.  Here's the inside...  A friendly psychopath.  Here's the fucking inside skinny on Tom.  Yeah, please, please.  He's a piece of shit.  Okay.  Every comment knows it.  Then welcome.  Yes.  Tom's a terrible guy, and all the comedians know it.  Really?  Yes.  What do you mean a terrible guy?  See, I've been trying to figure it out for years.  I'm like, there's something...  Do you know how many waitresses he's gotten fired because of poor service?  Oh, really?  Oh, shit.  The comedians really love him, though, because we all hate bad service at the comedy table.  But Tom would just sit there with Manny and now with Dome and just like, you know, 
[02:24:00]  Yes, the table's dirty.  Oh, shit.  Oh, and before you know it, their fucking heads are chopped off outside.  A little passive-aggressive.  Oh, yeah.  A little passive-aggressive.  Yeah.  I think it's great that you don't work them that hard on a Saturday night.  That's good.  Just let them do what they do.  They shouldn't have to clean, too.  Yeah, once Tom has a hard-on for you as a waitress, you're finished.  You're out.  If you think this works for your business, that's fine.  The DJ, we got him scrapped.  Is he still there on Saturdays?  He is still there.  Oh, he is?  I thought he was done.  They have a DJ at the Comedy Center? 
[02:24:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  At the Olive Tree upstairs.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not that distracting, actually.  It was when it started.  It was too loud.  They have a DJ now on Saturday nights.  When you guys are trying to talk at that back table?  No, no, no.  Exactly.  But he's by the front.  So Noam got a DJ.  Because Noam's a fucking club guy.  He owns clubs.  But that place didn't need that.  A cafe is for conversation.  Yeah.  Right.  That's a great place to just hang and talk.  We had the volume of morning.  And also, there's a pfft, pfft.  Oh, I was just like, what'd you say?  Oh, nothing was. 
[02:25:00]  Half the crowd.  Talking over loud fucking music.  Oh, the worst.  And how'd you handle that?  No, if you think music's going to help the business.  I know.  That one, I was just aggressive.  There's no passive about it.  I was like, this blows.  I'm going home as soon as that music starts.  None of the comedians like that.  We don't like anything that competes with us chatting.  No.  Who else did?  I didn't like it.  You didn't like it.  Carl hated it.  Fucking, uh...  But it's not just you guys chatting.  Like he said, everyone.  It's a nice vibe.  Exactly.  People go there just to kind of hang and talk a little bit.  Hang and talk.  That's what it's about.  A little music in the background is fine. 
[02:25:30]  You want to put it on your little iPod that's fine.  Something light.  Yeah.  Light.  Light fare.  I am a nice guy.  I don't think that I'm a mean fella.  You're not a mean...  No, you're not a mean fella.  That's the thing.  You're not overtly or outwardly mean.  He called you a piece of shit.  Not mean.  Because Tom...  You're a very pleasant piece of shit.  No, no.  Tom isn't a nice...  His wife's very nice.  Tom's a nice dude.  Like you go out with him and he just seems...  He has this amazing smile and everything.  And he just seems like the funnest guy.  But he's a fucking man about business. 
[02:26:00]  Well, I think that's what makes the comedians angry is that everybody knows that you guys are pieces of shit.  And I'm faking it.  Yeah.  You're faking it.  I get away with...  Oh, you're getting away with some shit.  I don't think he's a piece of shit.  Why can he hang out in normal circles and they don't realize what he really is?  I get it.  Seinfeld probably knows that Tom's kind of a creep, but he doesn't probably understand.  Because Tom will probably say things like, why is the service here so bad?  And Jerry will probably just go like, yeah.  Like he doesn't really... 
[02:26:30]  Well, it is bad.  Tom probably just makes him realize things.  No, no, no.  Because Jerry is actually the same way that I am.  Comedians are all the same.  You know.  Yeah, yeah.  He fakes it pretty good, huh?  Yeah.  Or he's just completely like...  He'll be really aggressive.  How about you not talk about that?  Well, some people...  Trying to say, you know.  You know what the...  You're in a good spot with Jerry.  Secret message received.  Some people...  You don't want to get in trouble with Jerry.  We don't want to caution you your Jerry gig.  I know.  What's wrong with you?  No, but there's a...  This is a big drop off, Tom. 
[02:27:00]  I know you like doing the show, but you should like hanging out with Jerry a little more.  Shut up.  People do just know him from the television show and even the stand-up, which comes across  completely different because it's edgy sometimes.  Like on the show, on Seinfeld, he's normally just some self-centered guy that's not that  in your face or anything.  Right.  But there were a couple of episodes where he's like, oh, that's Jerry. 
[02:27:30]  Right.  That's the real one.  Jerry's just a little like...  They're just honest.  They're just like...  People will come up and tell him a joke and he'll just look at him and be like, why would  you do that?  Why would you do that?  He would get so uncomfortable and he'll just...  Terrible.  But he's comfortable in...  Like, this is why I like...  I've had very...  Limited interactions with him, but he's always been very nice.  Yeah, you guys get along.  But you know that when he's chatting with you, it's because he really wants to.  There's no...  Right.  And I told him when we were doing that Geraldo benefit, actually, I was standing next to him  on the line. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  And like, somebody went to hug him or something, and you know, he doesn't want to be fucking  hugged.  Hugged him.  And he kind of tensed up, but the woman's like, oh, sorry.  But he was right.  You don't know him.  He's going to hug him.  Like, you're fucking him?  And...  Yeah, like Oprah.  Who the fuck would hug Oprah if you don't know her?  Oh, that's right.  That's right.  You do that.  That's right.  I didn't even realize.  Oh, boy.  But that's true.  Oh, man.  A little awkward in here.  I said to him, I'm like, dude, there is no...  I'm like, what I like about you, I'm like, there's no bullshit in you.  Yeah.  You just interact honestly. 
[02:28:30]  And I think he said, um, are you joking?  Like, there's a lot of bullshit.  Like, I have to be nice.  There's a lot of bullshit.  Like, I guess he was saying, like, some of these hellos...  Certain people, yeah.  Some of these hellos were not as genuine as I thought they were.  Maybe the conversation he was having at that very moment.  Believe me, I can say shit.  Of course he's edgy.  But there's always that thing of, you know, in your act or on TV that you're a certain guy.  And, you know, there was this great story that Dick Cavett had about Jack Benny. 
[02:29:00]  Like, Dick Cavett loved Jack Benny, you know, and he was working on, like, the Tonight Show or something.  And he got in the elevator with him.  He just wanted to, like, he would always sneak into the elevator at the last minute and ride with the big stars.  Oh, shit.  He gets in with Jack Benny and they're going down.  There's all these other people in there.  And the people are just like, so how's Rochester?  And are you really cheap?  And asking all these Jack Benny stuff.  And he's just smiling.  And Dick Cavett thought to himself, wow, he really is very gracious.  Like, he really likes these people.  And he handles himself.  He's very giving. 
[02:29:30]  And the elevator opens and everybody dumps off.  And it's just Dick Cavett and Jack Benny.  And Jack Benny goes to the little young Dick Cavett.  You know, some days you just want to tell them to go fuck themselves.  Oh, that's fantastic.  But the point is, you can't be a comedian without having that in you.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, I think you're right.  Bob Saget's a very good example of what you were saying, too.  Yeah.  Because a lot of people are very shocked to find out that he's a really dirty, edgy comic.  Yeah.  And always was.  Always was. 
[02:30:00]  And then he got, you know, picked to do two huge shows.  Huge shows.  Yeah.  And everyone thought he was this family guy.  What's funny about him is that he was just now, like, in the last, you know, eight years,  is just letting everybody know.  Oh, my God.  Over the top.  Over the top.  Well, what's great about that, I saw him in the old Westbury Music Fair.  Westbury.  Westbury.  And you see it right in front of your eyes where people go, oh, my God, this isn't the  TV guy that I know and love.  And they walk out. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, really?  You get a few walkouts.  Sing to him.  Because they, yeah, they went to see, exactly, but they're getting the real Bob Saget.  But Bob is a nice guy.  Like, Bob won't.  Love him.  Seinfeld makes people uncomfortable with his honor.  Like, he really won't give you that bullshit, which I like, man.  He won't let you off the hook.  No.  No fake laugh.  But it's not a scumbag move, either.  It's like, it's not like he's being a dick to people.  It's like they're doing something which requires him to be dishonest to make them comfortable. 
[02:31:00]  He probably enjoys that.  Like, that uncomfortableness.  Some people do.  He might.  I think maybe.  Or he's not afraid of it.  And I admire that.  Some people are afraid of it.  Really funny.  I admire that he's not afraid of it.  I'm afraid of it.  I like uncomfortable.  Right.  I get uncomfortable and start fake laughing.  Like, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, that's great.  I'm going to make you feel okay because he's really shitting on you.  Right.  But I love that uncomfortableness.  I love it.  Someone came up to him.  We were waiting for an elevator a couple weeks ago. 
[02:31:30]  And someone came up and had some kind of show, like some cable show or something.  And she's like, we'd really love you to do this show.  And he just goes, I don't know what that is.  Oh, shit.  It was so great.  She was like, oh.  What show was it?  Do you know, Tom?  Offhand?  I, yes.  It was the, uh, the show on, a show on the Yes Network.  Ooh.  It was like one of those talk shows on the Yes Network.  Sports, uh, shows. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, that's the enemy.  We really want you to do it, really.  He just looks at her and goes, I don't know what that is.  Rather than just like, yeah, maybe.  You know?  Yeah, let's see.  He's just, I don't know what that is.  And that's not a dick move.  Is Bohop here?  That's not a dick move, by the way.  Like, to, to, because he, you are expecting him to behave in a way that, let's see, if  you say, hey, Jay, I'm a big fan, and he goes, I don't care, that's a dick move.  Right.  But he doesn't do that.  No.  It's like, he's not going to fake laugh for you.  Thank you.  Which is, which comedians, it's almost like he shames the rest of us into like, not fake 
[02:32:30]  laughing.  It's like, goddammit, I hate that I do that.  Like, why should I pull that person off the hook when they're being an idiot?  Yeah.  Exactly.  I do that.  I fucking hate myself for it.  It really is.  It's trying to break up that uncomfortable moment.  Right.  Exactly.  Instead of relishing it.  Have you ever done one of these things where you're watching a movie, and you know-  Yes, absolutely.  Yes, yes.  I have too.  Just want to let you know.  I never have.  Never have. 
[02:33:00]  No, no.  Not yet.  They're great.  They move in two dimensions, though, but it's quite amazing.  You watch a movie, and you're with somebody else, and you've seen the movie before,  and you know a douchey part's coming up, and you purposefully talk over it, so as to distract  from the moment, so you don't have to acknowledge with that other person that there's something  so cringe-inducing on the screen.  So you're just like, yeah, do you want anything to drink or something, as it's happening, and  then you can just relax when it's over?  Yeah.  I know. 
[02:33:30]  What would be a moment like that?  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, buddy.  What would be a moment like that?  Me telling that story?  No, no.  That was just your friend at a party at the table.  Here's what that went.  Bernard's here.  Okay.  Oh, nice.  No, I'm serious.  Yeah, I can't think of an instance, but there have been-  Tom has to take Danny's seat to me.  Yeah.  On TV shows or movies.  Just go around a little bit.  Hold on one second.  Shufflep.  Shufflep.  What, are you having fresh breath for when you kiss?  You're popping gum in your mouth.  Look at you.  I would have done that anyway, yeah.  Just move these monitors.  Fuck me.  Love to. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, I'm saying.  Fuck me.  Move these.  What do we need?  The monitors?  He's going to punch us right in the face.  No, he's a nice man.  Like a lizard or something in the monitor.  Bring him in.  I like just doing the impression every so often.  It's fun.  Bring-  Bernard!  Come on in!  There he is.  Come on in, champ!  How you doing, man?  What's up, man?  See you, man.  Any young boys in here for me?  Look at you.  You're in your Clark-  You got your Clark Kent look going.  I mean, nobody up in the stage.  Clark Kent look. 
[02:34:30]  Right?  Bernard, that's Tom Papa, just so you know.  A real funny guy.  That's the one.  We would love you to hit Tom Papa.  We would love you.  That's the one.  Give me the wink, man.  That's the one.  We love Bernard.  Isn't that scary?  Yeah, he's like steel.  Yeah, look at that.  He's like steel.  He really is.  Yeah, Bernard's a strong man.  He scared me down the first time he was on the show.  It's like an angle.  That's what you send me.  Oh, I know you do.  A young boy was trying to jump on a young man.  Oh, man.  How old are you?  He pulls me specky elders.  Young guy tried to jump on me and hit me with that right hand. 
[02:35:00]  I said, what?  It was like a pin on the block.  How old was that guy?  29?  28.  28.  I'm 46.  First of all, you don't look 46.  When June come, I'll be six months from 47.  Man, I'm January.  So now you're seven months from 47.  Yeah.  There you go.  So you're almost 46.  Great man, Jim.  Yeah, yeah.  And it actually hurt.  Yeah, yeah, right.  See, you're just like, ow.  You're going to wake up tomorrow all bruised.  We talked yesterday.  You told me about the wink.  I spoke.  Yeah.  Do you know how great it would be? 
[02:35:30]  You must have, you know, you must have asked Betty.  Pissed him off or something.  Knock you off as soon as I come in here.  Knock you off.  That would be great.  Bernard's more hopped up after a fight, though.  We've never seen you, Bernard.  We've never seen you after a fight.  Yeah, this is a different Bernard.  Usually you're chill and getting ready.  You know what I mean?  You're in the zone.  I can't really eat like I want to, so now I'm cool.  Yeah, you are, man.  I want an extra five pounds.  We like the other Bernard, too.  Don't get us wrong, because I don't want to get hit.  I'm straight, man.  I took care of my body and rested up after the fight.  You know, a little sore and thawing out. 
[02:36:00]  We call it thawing out in boxing after the fight's over.  You know, you've got little aches and pains.  Yeah.  Little lumps here.  Did you take any shots that you were like, wow, okay, that hurt a little bit?  Yeah, that's when I jumped on him.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't be hitting an old man like that.  I didn't see the wall.  You didn't see me?  No, I didn't see the fight.  I didn't see me for years.  Yes.  And I actually couldn't find it on YouTube.  HBO, you know what they do.  Oh, yeah, they rerun.  It's probably going to die out by tomorrow.  People thought you were going to go down?  Oh, they always think I'm going down.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, nobody, you know, 40 is kind of... 
[02:36:30]  Your legs got a little shaky.  As though my legs get shaky and they're shaky now.  No.  It's the thing where, like, you know, come on.  You're in your late 30s, in your early 40s, you're normally done with any sports.  Sure, yeah.  I mean, golf, you're just about maybe hanging on by the threads.  You know, if you're palmer or somebody, great.  But other than that, man, I'm pushing it in a little, man, but I'm pushing it in a respectful way.  And I'm just glad I'm healthy. 
[02:37:00]  I came out there without any cuts.  Never been cutting boxing.  That's great, man.  And I'm cool, man.  You know, of course, I'm sore, aches and pains.  But that's the thing.  What hurts the most on your body right now?  Rivers?  No, my, like, joints.  Yeah.  From the running and the training.  I mean, you're talking nine weeks of grueling training, and I still put it in like I'm 25.  It's not like I adjusted my training resume.  I mean, I still run with the young boys through the 80s twice a week, run three miles, sometimes four. 
[02:37:30]  It depends on what workload I have for the next day because I want to leave it all on the track.  So Nazeem and Danny Davis, they say, okay, Monday, I know what I have to do.  Tuesday, I know what I have to do.  Wednesday, I know what I have to do.  Monday, Wednesdays, and Fridays are boxing days.  Days I get in there with three different guys, sometimes four.  And I give him four rounds, three rounds, six rounds.  Wow.  One day we do eight.  One day we do nine.  They never tell me.  They ambush me.  Oh, so you don't know.  I never leave out.  It's not like when I do four with him, I get out to get a break, and I'm two box. 
[02:38:00]  They're not fighting.  They're my help.  So I never leave.  I stay in the gym.  Oh, my God.  Like it's a fresh body, fresh body, fresh body.  It's a sub, but only one size subbing.  Wow.  Right.  I mean, like Bay Basketball.  Yeah.  I mean, they come in front, and then, you know, this guy's trying to work me so the next guy can get me.  Or a tag team match where the guy can't tag.  Right.  He hate that.  And the next guy's looking and licking his chops because he's seeing this guy jump on me because my trainer's telling him to do what? 
[02:38:30]  Jump on Bernard.  So I've got to fight to win, fight to survive, fight to stay in the game, and fight to win the rounds.  And if your sparring partners aren't doing the right thing, they're going to be replaced.  So they can't.  They added it.  And they get a $1,000 bonus if they pick me on my seat.  No.  Really?  Yes.  Wow.  So they're trying to knock you down.  Does that ever happen?  Does it ever happen?  No, because I'm smart enough to get them before they come there and say, look, I gave you $2,000.  That's funny.  That's funny.  That's really good.  Do you take glucosamine for your joints? 
[02:39:00]  Yes.  A little glucosamine.  I'm just starting to take it.  They're good for you.  It is good.  And they commission the rules.  It's like over the counter.  It's good stuff.  By the way, that's all you two have in common.  Yeah.  By the way, do you know how he knows about that?  Oh, man, that stuff be squeaking.  I mean, your ladies are like, what the heck?  Yeah, I think that's their motto on the commercial.  That stuff be squeaking.  Listen, on the body, when it cracks and you move, they're squeaking.  Like on the bike.  You're like beer cans.  That's the body where I'm squeaking. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  They're cracking.  I said, what the heck?  My arm?  It's all the joints.  You got to move that shit up.  You got to move it up, man.  And now he knows about it.  I need a runner to the warm up.  That's why when you do get a chance to see the fight, I'll get a DVD.  I mean, it wasn't a bad start off, but I had to get warm.  Yeah.  On the third round, he was like, well, people was like, Bernard, this guy's like, and this  guy's strong, Haitian, young bull, who's a champion, who's got confidence, who has- 
[02:40:00]  Hungry.  Hungry.  He's saying, I beat Bernard Hopkins.  This is a legend.  He becomes an instant star.  HBO got a contract waiting for him to sign if he beats me.  Wow.  And I got crumbled up and thrown in a garbage dump.  No, they slid it over to me and said, we have to fight two more fights.  But I said, hell yeah.  You're going to keep fighting.  Are you kidding me?  I got Chad Dawson on the menu then.  I was in a contract.  Man.  That's why Chad fought under my undercard.  How long for now, though?  That's why Chad Dawson fought under my undercard. 
[02:40:30]  Because like a tournament, like give you something to look forward to.  Chad Dawson, big, another young, strong.  So you get to see him.  Well, I've been watching him already, but he got the chance to highlight his self.  But I mean, yeah, the people get to see him and you.  Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely.  So it gives you a little more of a, yeah, yeah, a look, you've got to see these two go  at it, right?  And Pascal beat Chad Dawson.  Okay.  Right.  And me and Chad, and Pascal called me out.  You know, I'm home with my teeth out in the rocking chair.  He called me out and said, I like to fight Bernard Hopkins, the legend. 
[02:41:00]  And I took the, you know, the challenge.  And here we are.  We got two fights out of it.  The first one was a draw, which I believe I won, in Canada.  And I said, you know what?  I told Richard Schaefer, Golden Boy Promotion CEO, we won a purse bid.  We had the right to take the fight to wherever we wanted to take it at, in the States or  in Canada.  I said, he got a big following.  You know what?  I love Canada.  We're going to be in Montreal.  We're not going to be in Quebec City.  We're not going to be in Toronto, which is no problem with me.  But let's go to Montreal, outside of New York. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, nice.  Look, they paying.  Let's go.  Bernard, you want to go to Montreal?  I said, let's go to Montreal.  I said, that's gangster.  We go to Montreal, where he's from, right?  Where he's adopted home.  He's really Haitian.  But let's go to Montreal, kick his ass in Montreal, gain Canadian fans, and there we  go.  And it worked out fine.  That's where Sugar Ray won the fucking Olympics.  Oh, yeah, the Olympics.  The gold medal.  Wow.  We have him coming in.  I've been reading his book.  And he was saying about fighters that you get scared of taking that one fight that you 
[02:42:00]  shouldn't have taken as the years go on.  Are you scared that that will happen to you at one point?  Or do you just know that you're in a place where you're not going to have one fight that  just makes it really bad for you?  Not with me.  You know any fight that can happen to you.  But me, I just don't.  I mean, I've been in the game too long to take something that I'm going to be afraid  of.  But I'm not going to be afraid of anything that I've conditioned myself not to be afraid  of.  But that's just an instant boxing situation.  We're in denial about getting hurt about anybody or we wouldn't fight them. 
[02:42:30]  That's just not in our DNA, at least not mine.  Now, as far as doing the right business sense and fighting the guys you're supposed to fight  in your weight class and not saying, oh, I can fight this guy, I can fight that guy and  getting cocky and getting too caught up on yourself.  But with me, it's always, you know, a thing where, you know, you have some suspicious or  some, I guess, some worry about, you know, this guy got a good right hand, so I got to  watch out for that.  But that, to me, doesn't mean scared.  Not to me.  To me, it means, and again, I respect Leonard. 
[02:43:00]  I know what he's, well, I know how he's putting it, but I'm putting it as far as me.  But on Hopkins, maybe my fears are translated into, okay, he got a dangerous right hand.  I got to be careful of that.  To me, that's not scared.  That's just saying, be aware that no matter how good I am, if I get hit with his right  hand, I'm human, that I might be doing a Jerry Lewis.  To me, he was a funny dancer.  We haven't even acknowledged yet that you beat George Foreman's record, obviously. 
[02:43:30]  Yes.  It's the oldest in history.  How old was Foreman?  45.  No, Foreman's a dinosaur, and I'm a dinosaur.  No, no.  He was 45.  BC.  400 BC.  But yeah, he was 40.  Was he nice to you?  I think I remember.  No, no, I did beat his record.  No, I know you beat his record.  Was he nice to you?  I'm trying to remember.  Yes, George George called me twice.  It was all on the air way before the fight last week, and he also called me.  Congratulations.  And he also said, hell goes to Kane.  The Kane, you know, and he did a thing for HBO that he didn't have to do. 
[02:44:00]  He did a thing for Golden Boy.  We did a teleconference with all the media, and they asked him first, and then they asked  me, and then they had so many media people asking questions back and forth.  You're going to put out a burger, cooking, grilling thing?  Anybody deserve it.  You got to do that now.  Put out a burger, grill.  Yes, anybody deserve, thank you, anybody deserve to break my record the way I did.  He did, as he said, is Bernard Hopkins.  Long live the king.  Wow, that's great.  Coming from George Foreman, the only thing I need is a grill now.  Yeah, get the grill. 
[02:44:30]  That's all I need now, is a grill.  Yeah, that's where he made his money.  Now we're into the big money.  How many more years do you think you have?  It's not years with me.  It's just historic moments for me.  Like I said, I got a two-fight duel right now.  That's what you're looking at.  A two-fight duel.  Now we're down to two with HBO.  I'm going to fulfill that contract.  Nice.  And the last one, I'm hoping it would be, will be a guy named Boutte, who's a well-known  Canadian who gets 50,000 people in the arena if he fights Donald Duck. 
[02:45:00]  Jesus, you just keep beating up the Canadians.  And he's younger.  He's not that young.  He's like 30, but that's young compared to 46.  Yeah, yeah, sure.  And he's a real boring Canadian.  And he gets, like I said, 50,000 people if he fights Donald Duck.  Imagine me there.  Oh, yeah.  So I'm like, I mean, this is amazing.  Here I'll be almost 47, and I'm still in a high demand.  And again, we're not talking about Bernard.  You know, of course you can get hurt in anything, no matter how old you are.  But, you know, this is a blessing to be in a situation, in a hard sport, where, you know, 
[02:45:30]  we don't, your career don't last 10 years if you're lucky.  Yeah.  And again, I consider myself smart enough to know when to leave.  And I got a lot of other things great going on.  I've been coming here many, many years, and I've done right by my decisions and my finances  and my personal life is intact.  I'm not all over the place.  That's important.  And, you know, of course, I don't drink. 
[02:46:00]  I don't smoke.  I don't waste extra money on different things.  I hate gambling.  I hate losing.  Oh, smart.  So these are the key point things that kept me grounded over the years.  I'm on the road to ruin.  That's great.  He just named all your fans.  He named everything I do.  Can you straighten him out?  Because every vice you mention, he has.  He gambles, drinks.  For longevity, I think that's why I'm here, too.  I mean, yeah, I can say I'm that good, but I ain't a fool.  I know there's a lot of other ingredients that goes in that success cake that I've been baking 
[02:46:30]  for all these years.  It's my cake Iraq won't eat.  The success cake.  It's our fat friend in there.  The way you've been treating your body, you probably get sick.  Oh, well, no.  Actually, I work out.  You work out?  Yeah.  I got it.  It's like one of those things.  Sleeping.  Exactly.  That's good.  He's been thawing out his whole life.  They do eyelid exercises.  Close them for eight hours, open them for a couple.  Drink, pass out, close for ten.  Anthony takes his knuckles and he punches holes in the little walls and rest areas. 
[02:47:00]  That's Anthony's fucking exercise.  He's a fucking Peter Pumper.  I hear Jimmy's voice on the other side of the hole.  You certainly do.  And I didn't like Tom, by the way, asking how many years you got left.  That's not a fucking boxer's question.  Men like Bernard and myself understand that.  You don't understand that.  I mean, I know it's a question that people curious about.  Well, because what everyone's talking about is the age.  Yeah, I mean, of course, I can't box until I'm 70 years old.  But, you know, I know when it's time to box in one way or the other, right?  You get your ass kicked and you know that.  Wait a minute.  You're 47 years old. 
[02:47:30]  You've never been beat like that before.  You made it out with your life.  Hopefully, then go.  That does suck, though.  That's got to be the way that you know is by getting your ass handed to you.  But it's not like a lottery ticket.  It's not like you get this much fame and money and things like that.  And then you say, okay, I'm leaving.  And you can go ahead and quit your job and do what you got to do.  I mean, I've been doing this half of my life.  I'm 46.  I've been boxing since 1988.  As a professional, I started since I was nine years old.  So the math will tell you that this is what I've been doing for basically half of my life. 
[02:48:00]  Now, okay, if I'm blessed to get another 40 years on this earth, I want to enjoy those not only healthy,  not only with my daughter's 11 years old, just had another daughter.  So I want to be there for them.  I want to be there to talk sensible to the teacher when it's time.  So I understand these things.  I understand these things becoming really important now because now I'm going to set their life up and their kid's life if everything is done right.  Trust-wise.  Trust-wise.  You'll get out in time, man.  Because, I mean, a lot of old boxers, it's kind of sad when they come in here. 
[02:48:30]  But do they start to feel like, do you think they start to see effects before?  That's what I want to know.  Like Ali or Meldrick Taylor, do they start to see it before?  I mean, I'm not 100% right.  What are you talking about?  But you sound as nuts as you are now, though.  I've watched interviews from 20 years ago.  You're the same guy, though.  Yeah, but every night I get flashbacks.  You're nuts.  I mean, come on now.  I mean, every night I get flashbacks.  What he's saying, there's no drop-off whatsoever.  And I think some of these guys, when they were in their 40s, just started to kind of see it in their interviews and stuff. 
[02:49:00]  And everyone around Ali knew what was happening.  But he kept fighting, right?  Even his trainer left because he couldn't bear what was going on.  Well, you know what I do a lot, though?  Dundee.  I'm going to give up a secret.  So maybe we can help somebody.  I've got 13 puzzles I play with.  You have to do puzzles?  You have to do puzzles?  No.  I can't.  You keep the brain stimulating.  Sudoku.  It's all about the Sudoku.  You do puzzles?  I was so happy as a way I could lose my man tits without working out.  Puzzles!  I'll do puzzles! 
[02:49:30]  Puzzles!  Puzzles!  Hey, do you think...  This is true, too, because Larry...  Because you've said some things that people take issue with, I guess.  And Larry Holmes always did that, too.  And a lot of people didn't like Larry Holmes.  And then I think when he fought Ali, it's like...  You kind of loved him after that because you felt like he really could have knocked Ali out.  And he didn't.  He didn't want to hurt Ali.  And he loved Ali.  You got the feeling that he didn't want to hurt Ali in that fight?  Of course, man.  He said it.  He was his idol.  He sparred with him.  He was his sparring partner, for God's sake.  Yeah, and Larry Holmes knew that Ali wasn't the Ali that he remembered. 
[02:50:00]  He cried at the end of it.  He cried at the end, and he told him, say, man, look, why are you fighting?  If you need some money, I know what you need.  Wow.  I got you.  Don't do this no more, champ.  He really was hurt by that.  Oh.  Yeah, he was his sparring partner in Zaire for the Foreman fight.  Yeah, he was really hurt by that.  He said that...  Larry's a good friend.  He's a good guy's wife.  And everybody, he's a good guy.  I met him one time.  He went to visit him in the hospital after the fight, right?  Right, exactly.  And Ali was like, you know, I love you.  And he was crying, and he was just like, you know, it was this really nice moment. 
[02:50:30]  And then on his way out, Ali was like, I can still take you.  If you love me, why'd you beat me up?  That's right.  If you love me, why'd you beat me up so bad?  Oh, shit.  It's hard to see Ali.  It's so hard to see him like that, Bernard, knowing what he was.  But you know, I wanted to, I wanted to, my fight last Saturday, and even leading up to  the fight, you know, Pascal said some things that have never been said to me in boxing, 
[02:51:00]  especially around, I guess you could say, the era of the baseball, the runners, the joggers,  whatever allegations that people either paid guilty to or they didn't bury bonds and stuff  like that.  When the guys want to pump a fight up or want to do something and say something, there's  a lot of other things that I've did and said, but one thing I never said, somebody ate a  candy bar, somebody done something because they beat me or because they shouldn't be that 
[02:51:30]  good.  Even after I said he's a legend, that's why I want to fight him, he done all these things,  boom, boom.  And then when you're in denial that you are, you got outsmart because I got wisdom and you  got outboxed and you got outfought and you say, well, take the test, you cheated, you  cheated, you cheated, you cheated.  You don't, you don't turn your nose on that.  Did he say that?  Yeah, it was all on YouTube and everything like that.  And I told everybody at the press conference that started asking questions, well, Bernard,  you know, why would he say that? 
[02:52:00]  And would you take the test on that?  He didn't flip from the first fight, becoming a draw in Quebec City, down to a allegation.  And so I wanted to really, like, seriously, not get off my game, but punish him and show  him and then set a message that at the end of the day, you know, you got to be accountable  for what you say.  Oh, after the first fight, he said that?  Yes.  Oh, because after this fight, I heard he was pretty graceful in defeat right after the  second fight.  Well, that was after the fight, but this is all the news now. 
[02:52:30]  This is all SportsCenter and everything.  Right.  You know, I know they're going to ask me when I'm headed up ESPN in Hartford, Connecticut  later on this afternoon.  But that was like a hot topic.  And then, you know, people that, you know, the sports people, even my, my, my, not biggest  fans, they was like, you know, writers and stuff like, oh, Bernard, he's, I mean, again,  nobody's exempt from doing anything.  But when you come talking about clean living, the way he take it himself and all that,  you might say he's a loud mouth.  You might say he threw the Puerto Rican flag down.  You might say he did this, he did that.  You might say he said the thing about Joe Galzaki, he'll never let a white boy beat him 
[02:53:00]  and all this whole stuff.  But when it comes to whether he's working hard and busting his chops to be who he is,  which we all credit him for, a lot of people couldn't really like buy that.  But he said it, and, and, and, and, um, I'm not going to get into it, but it will be some  repercussions.  Now, let me ask you, too, um, you, you, uh, you said some things, I mean, I say that because  I kind of like that.  You messed with my legacy.  You messed with my name and you, you, you, you, you, it's good to cut you off, but what 
[02:53:30]  you're doing is, you can't say certain things, even though we in this country, which is great  of the freedom of speech, but you can't make allegations on something, on somebody, uh, that's,  that, that built something, uh, um, took two decades and some change to do.  And you try to wipe it out by saying something that would put me under the light of being  suspicious, especially in this era we live in.  Right, right, right.  I mean, come on.  Exactly, when everyone's accusing everyone.  Right, and you know, I'm, I used to be, well, I'm still a golden boy, but he's not. 
[02:54:00]  And then Shane Mosley, who did admit to whatever he was doing and, and, and start, he started  mentioning these guys all on YouTube.  Shane Mosley, he got a trainer named Nazean Richardson.  I said, wait a minute.  Nazeem trains you too, you too, right?  Yeah, he's tying me in with Shane Mosley?  Are you kidding me?  So now they became now like, okay, he forced me now to be able to, like, you know, like,  wait a minute, I gotta, I gotta stand up and it won't be in the ring.  I did the ring thing first.  I took care of my job.  That was the plan.  Take care of my job and then let them take care of this.  This guy accused Bernard of doing steroids and Bernard is going to sue his ass for fucking 
[02:54:30]  accusing him of doing steroids, which is probably fine.  You beat the shit out of him and then you take his belt and then you sue him for saying  that.  That's my interpretation of that.  No, that is that.  And that's smart.  That is that.  I mean, it's like, what else are you going to do?  A guy can't lump you in like that and accuse you of doing something that is either career  ending or like you said, legacy ending.  That goes beyond shit talking.  Yeah, of course.  And guess what?  The thing is, that goes beyond shit talking.  But guess what?  Even better.  You know, we had three months since December of last year to now.  We had almost four months. 
[02:55:00]  It was really six or seven to bring it up in the negotiations.  He never brought it up.  He never said, like Floyd, at least Floyd Mayweather said to what?  Pacquiao.  Pacquiao.  And then he said it to the guy he fought before then, Shane Mosley.  Look, if you want to fight me, Shane, you got to do this.  And they was doing it every random time they was doing it.  He never brought up to even his promoter, Yvonne Michelle.  He never brought up to nobody.  He brought up in Montreal in front of the media.  Right.  Just for attention.  When we were at the podium, when his time was coming up and my time was coming up, 
[02:55:30]  everybody, I mean, everybody was looking dumbfounded.  Oh, shit.  He grabbed the microphone.  That's sleazy.  Take the test.  Take the test.  And he lost focus.  You cheated.  That's when I got him.  Oh, right.  See, take the test is nothing.  You can say anybody take the test.  Sure.  But when he said, you cheated.  You cheated.  You cheated.  You cheated.  Now he's making it direct.  Yeah.  And I'm not a lawyer, but I've been around him.  It's a definitive statement.  Exactly.  That's a definitive statement. 
[02:56:00]  That's not an innuendo.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, to say somebody, look, that's why the news says allegedly.  If he says, I'm alleging that there was cheating, there's a big difference between that and making  a statement of fact.  It saves you.  Yeah.  Yeah, it does, because that's a statement of fact is a big difference.  Let me ask you.  You said some, the reason I like, one of the things I like about you is you really never  care about being polite when you speak.  Like, you'll say things like, no, white boy is going to be, things that you should say  as an athlete and people shouldn't crucify you for.  And Donovan McMahon, you gave a beating to. 
[02:56:30]  Do you just genuinely don't like Donovan or?  We're going out to dinner.  We're going to have, but the thing is, it ain't got to do with I don't like Donovan McMahon.  Or do you not respect him?  I just, I just, as an athlete, see something that an athlete has or don't have by my experience  of doing what I've done for almost two decades.  Certain piece that you need to become one of the great ones and put yourself in position  to at least be a campaign for the great ones. 
[02:57:00]  Because in America and society today, good is okay, but good is not great.  There's a lot of good people that don't have rings or belts or a trophy of NFL.  When I've seen the makeup and the personality, great guy, great Chunky Soup commercial, everything is fine.  But it's something that has to be in your DNA to go over the top. 
[02:57:30]  I can name four or five athletes in different sports that you'll be like, hey, that's some heavy hitters.  Not only to win, but win again and win again and win again.  That's the great Jordan.  Say it again.  Everybody can't be Jordan.  I can't be Jordan.  And I can't be Ray Robinson, the great Ray Robinson, Sugar Ray Robinson.  But when you have the chance, which we know he did, and again, there's more than one person on the field.  It just didn't have that hump.  And somebody finally in personnel of Philadelphia has seen it and made the change. 
[02:58:00]  But, you know, again, I'm not a bandwagon guy.  But you have to come from certain era and certain, I guess, hardcore communities in certain sports to be hard.  And Michael Vick is a hard guy.  And let me tell you something, man.  You know, when a guy runs right past a linebacker and not worrying about going out of balance,  now we know we want to keep the quarterback because we need him. 
[02:58:30]  I mean, too much hard can be crazy, too.  But this is the type of thing I'm talking about when you've got it.  Yeah.  When you're mad because you ain't get the bar.  You're not smiling at anybody playing off.  You know, Philly fans are vicious.  Yeah.  They want you to feel a pain when we screw up.  You're supposed to at least act like it kicked something and you're smiling.  And that turned a lot of people off because when you're comfortable and you've done what you are comfortable with,  like when I'm on the belt, I said, hey, all these guys talking about their champions, I want to unify the title. 
[02:59:00]  It took some years.  I want to clean it up now who's the champ.  Okay, you're right.  Boxing is screwed up.  It's five champions in five different weight classes.  How many years is it going to take me to wipe all these people out and fight at the Garden and beat Tito and become undisputed?  But this is what certain people from certain cloths that's cut out of that cloth era becomes different and becomes historic conversations 10, 15 years from now. 
[02:59:30]  Do you see him as a sellout at all?  Do you see him as a sellout at all?  Because you said that there's certain people who are in the house or in the field while he's up in the house.  Do you see him as a sellout or the way he behaves or carries himself?  I see a situation where a guy was led to believe that he was one of the special ones and was going to get treated different.  And when he realized that he wasn't, he went back to reality and went on HBO and did his segment.  Now, what was the segment that he did that was, because I'm not familiar with the segment. 
[03:00:00]  Black quarterbacks has to do above and beyond what white quarterbacks has to do.  And he did that?  Yes.  So you feel like he thought it was going to be different for him, but it wasn't?  I felt like he said the right things, but it was just the wrong messenger saying it.  Okay.  Do you feel like he was...  You understand what I'm saying?  Kind of, yeah.  Like he gave the right message, but he wasn't sincere.  No, he was sincere, but it was the wrong person representing that statement.  Okay.  A more hardcore guy should have represented the statement. 
[03:00:30]  No, a more guy that knew that his position from day one was what it is.  So I think that if you played that role and now you're hurt because all of a sudden now that you are starting to see what people have already told you,  or maybe he didn't know what I have said.  And now he's starting to see that, man, I don't like that.  The trade rumors, the backlash he got for that particular year, and probably remember that, when they was talking about getting rid of him,  they was talking about, you know, they shouldn't have drafted him when they booed him in Philadelphia from his draft. 
[03:01:00]  So I think that he realized, it's like, you find out something that you've been told or heard, and you was told, no, we love you, we love you, we love you,  and you find out that they ain't the case, and you felt betrayed.  You feel your camel go out and throw out dirty laundry, and you say things, and then people say, okay, well, you know, it makes sense.  I remember the Doug era, Doug Williams era in Washington, D.C.  He got blackballed after he won the Super Bowl.  I mean, it is what it is. 
[03:01:30]  People don't like to talk about certain things because they're so sensitive about it, but, you know, that's what makes certain people certain people  because they don't have problems talking about certain things, no matter what, the backlash and the controversy.  That makes me me.  I was born with courage in my DNA, and so was a lot of historic people before me and will be after me.  And so when I see things, and I make my own personal analysis on it, and I could be wrong too,  but it started up a dialogue amongst people that's understood in a way and people that didn't understood. 
[03:02:00]  And then some people took it and twisted the way they wanted to twist it.  But as far as a person, I believe he's a fantastic person.  I believe he's a fantastic husband, family man, and everything.  But from an athlete analyzing another athlete like we do, and I know as an athlete for all these years,  and from my background coming from where I came from, negative to positive,  I can look at a guy and I can hear a guy speak. 
[03:02:30]  I can hear him play and see if it's fear in his heart, and I can see if it's hunger in his heart,  and I can see if he really got what it takes to be what he say he is.  And that comes with instincts, that comes with my background, that comes with being in jail for five years,  that comes from knowing what we call body language, nonverbals.  And then the language of mouth will emulate or will back up what you say physically.  So I have an inside track on not being a psychic, but I think the profession that I am for 20-something years, 
[03:03:00]  that when a guy tells me stuff all the time, what he's going to do to me, and this and that,  I know at the end it's the outcome that makes a difference,  but we do read between, if you're experienced enough, whether this guy just is scared as he's talking but trying to talk tough.  Do you see your intuition?  That's my advantage.  Your intuition?  And that's my advantage of looking at instincts. 
[03:03:30]  Instinct.  That's all it is.  Yeah.  And I see that, and so when I see certain things, I'm at a bad, I'm a fan of everything sports is out there.  So when I'm home in the city and I'm looking at whether it's Sixers or when I'm looking at whether it's the Phillies or the Eagles,  I don't look at myself as being Bernard Hopkins and I can speak because I'm Bernard Hopkins.  I get caught up like any other Philadelphia fan.  I'm a hardcore fan and I criticize by me being Bernard Hopkins and I have all these accolades tied to me.  Of course I get enough attention, I know that. 
[03:04:00]  But when I see something and there's times I'm mad, like, yo, man, this dude ain't even trying, man.  This dude's punking up.  I mean, who throws up at the Super Bowl?  Who gets, I mean, okay, it's nervous.  Okay, fine.  We all nervous.  But, yo, this is national TV, man.  Man up.  This is what it is.  There's no telling when you're going to get back there.  Don't you know how hard it is to get back to the Super Bowl?  What does your instinct tell you about Jim's heart?  He don't have any.  Like nothing?  Oh, he didn't have nothing. 
[03:04:30]  Just a black hole.  That is kind of true.  But at least one thing, one thing to tell you, one thing, he don't say he has one and he know he don't.  Yeah, thank you.  At least around me, he always submitted to that.  Be easy on me.  You know I'm a punk.  But this is, at least I respect that.  Fight back, Jim.  Fight back.  Tony, and then he come to find out that it's all hollow in his chest, then I got a problem.  I admit that I'm a sissy, and that is the difference. 
[03:05:00]  Sissy.  I don't like the fact that you and the marriage ref are bonding over what a pussy I am.  You know how hurtful that is?  The truth is the truth.  Just a hollow cave in your chest.  Yeah, but I'm not a fighter, though.  I've never been, I mean, I know you look at me and you probably think that I was groomed somehow to do one.  You know when people say you're not a fighter, normally they come back and say, well, I'm a lover?  I'm neither.  So you just all messed up.  I'm not a fighter, and I need Cialis to keep an erection.  I'm fucking, I'm a disaster.  We're getting the wrap up.  We got to wrap up with you. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, Bernard, that was fascinating to listen to, I got to tell you.  No problem, man.  He just doesn't have the heart to win the championship.  It's as simple as that.  In the end, he's got the skills, but he doesn't have that extra little fucking thing.  A lot of people are frontrunners.  But you said, I think you said that he wasn't black enough.  The front.  Which I think, wasn't that the exact quote or something?  Well, no, no, no, no.  But the bottom line is, what is black enough?  Black is no definitions or evidence to show that somebody's black enough.  He's black.  But when you're into that society of you're one of us, but you really understand that you can get tricked and think you are because of the success and because of what you're hearing. 
[03:06:00]  And that's the difference between being able to be you, no matter if it's going to be a thing where I got to be a certain way because I'm being accepted.  You're the quarterback and you're the top quarterback.  And if you get led into the situation where you corporate guy, we call them corporate guys.  Right.  So you can name a corporate guy, whatever.  A corporate guy is going to do what corporate people tell him to do.  We get that. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  So you understand, everybody's listening to this serious thing across the world, wherever you're located.  They understand it between the corporate guy and employee.  Right.  The corporate guy does what the corporate guy, do what the corporate guy tells them.  When a corporate guy go against those rules, the corporate guy gets punished.  He gets traded.  He gets talked about being traded.  He runs and goes on HBO and he talks about culture and he talks about what they have to do.  Then everybody's shocked.  They're like, wait a minute.  We took care of you.  Why are you throwing this out there?  Why are you talking like this? 
[03:07:00]  This ain't true.  You ain't supposed to do that.  So they're spanking and say, well, you ain't supposed to go there.  A guy is supposed to be doing that.  They're looking for a T.O. to do that.  They're looking for maybe a Vic at the time to do that.  They're looking for a Jim Brown to do that whole Jim Brown.  You know, you won't be surprised if you see that type of individual.  But you, not you, that's...  Gotcha.  I totally get it.  That's bullshit.  Totally get it.  I was just pretending I had heart.  Good job, Tim, man.  I mean, in five more seconds, you wouldn't have him. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah, or ahead.  Are you promoting St. Bernard?  What do you...  Well, first, I'm on a tour, media tour.  I'm fighting probably in September, October.  It will be with Chad Dawson, hopefully.  That's my contractual obligation.  And look for the boot tape fight or a big fight before I really hang it up.  Because I'm not going to stay around too long.  And guess what, y'all?  This is not just saying it.  Because when you say it, and you say it, say it, people won't leave you.  But it's about a wrap. 
[03:08:00]  There's no one that has to fight after one or two more fights.  And that's my contract with HBO.  And how many months before the next fight?  You're going to try to do it within the next year, right?  September, October.  Okay.  Where are you fighting?  Are you fighting in the States?  I would like to fight in Canada.  Oh, you do?  Okay, you want to go back to Canada.  He doesn't like Canada.  He likes beating up the Canadians.  Good.  They're annoying.  You don't have to be Canadian.  Just being in Canada.  I'll bring my lunch there.  Little known fact, Tom Papa is a Canadian.  So if you want to start with Tom Papa.  I've got a big fan base in Canada.  I will go to Canada tomorrow.  All right, we really got to get on. 
[03:08:30]  Let's go.  I want to take a photo with Bernard.  Bernard, always a pleasure, sir.  Absolutely.  Thanks, man.  I need to get gloves for him.  He's walking away from your picture.  You don't think Jimmy's got gloves?  He's walking away from Tom.  The guy with no fucking heart.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy's got gloves.  He's got the gloves on.  He remembers.  Walking away from your picture?  Of course Jimmy's got gloves for Bernard.  Brand new ones.  Ah, yeah.  There you go.  The champ is signing Jim Norton's gloves.  Bernard Hopkins, always a pleasure.  He never forgot us.  I think any glove that is signed, though, should be put on and blast Jimmy in the face with  it.  But I don't sell them. 
[03:09:00]  You can sign it to Jim.  You know I don't sell them.  No, I just mean it should be put on and he should punch you with it.  So you could have it signed and go, he hit me with that glove.  I punch you until the Sharpie comes off on your face.  Yeah.  Yeah, it proves it.  It's like a tattoo.  It just stays there permanently.  You can get that one to him.  He will never share his gloves.  Of course I will.  You'll give me one of the gloves?  Absolutely.  I'll fucking take it.  Damn, that's a real one.  I'll sell that.  I'll sell that shit.  Oh, shit.  Thank you, brother.  Hello, eBay.  Oh, my God.  That's pretty damn cool. 
[03:09:30]  Tom Popper, the marriage ref.  Season two of the marriage ref starts Sunday, June 26th at 10 p.m. and then airs for the  following nine weeks.  You're the real deal, brother.  You deserve all the success you got.  You know that.  Hey, Cam, you're not.  I'll be in Gotham next week if you want to come see me live.  Can you clean up the pits?  I'm sorry.  I swear a lot.  Did Bernard make you nervous?  I just sweat all the time.  I'm sweating.  I really like Bernard, though.  He's a fucking brutally honest guy.  And he's not uncomfortable to be around at all. 
[03:10:00]  He doesn't have a bully vibe to him.  He's just a fucking...  I really like him as a guy.  But you do know, like, you know, it's probably like Siegfried and Roy felt about the Tigers  at some point.  You're like, no, it's great.  I do this.  It's great.  And then something happens and he just rips your face off.  Right.  Like, you know he's got the potential to just fuck you up.  But I'm just...  Just him kidding around and just, like, knocking into you.  He's steel.  Yeah, it's like a girder.  He's literally like an anvil.  It's like a girder was being slammed against you. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah.  From a human being.  Yeah.  They're just built differently.  He's just...  Yes.  He's carbon fiber.  I really liked his seven-minute answer to your question.  It was a long one.  And I said fascinating because it really was.  I was going to tell him to shut up.  It was a look into the culture of sports that they don't really discuss anywhere else.  That was really interesting.  It was interesting.  It was basically describing that Michael Vick has what it takes to be a champion and  McNabb doesn't.  Yeah.  That's basically what he was saying.  That is exactly what he was saying.  Hopkins is...  Soft.  But he was explaining why. 
[03:11:00]  He's a Philly dude, man.  And that Philly vibe when you see...  Philly dog!  That's Keith Robinson.  That's Keith Robinson.  Keith is a fucking...  Philly!  Philly!  Keith is a fucking lunatic.  Like...  Oh, yeah.  He's a ballsy guy for real.  Keith's a fucking...  Keith would fucking fight anybody even if he'd get beat by the police six at a time.  It's like, could you just give him your license registration?  Why are you pulling it over?  Just keep your hands on the wheel.  Because I'm black man.  Why are you pulling it over?  All right.  He would say that to a black cop.  Because your taillight was out, dummy. 
[03:11:30]  Going Philly crazy.  That was funny.  Black man got to have two taillights?  What do you think of Jim's heart?  Do you think of Jim's heart?  He don't have one.  Yeah, yeah.  He don't have one.  But he's told me that from the beginning that he was a punk.  At least he knows it.  You're a punk.  What are you going to do?  No, I'm not.  Let me prove it to you.  But he likes the fact that I don't talk shit.  Yeah.  Yeah, see?  You should talk some shit.  That's why I said that's bullshit.  No, he's been working out.  You should have talked some shit, Jimmy.  Yeah.  See what that worked out as well.  I've been doing the elliptical, Bernard.  Yeah.  Who said you can move over, Tom?  No, I want Tom closer.  Oh.  I missed him. 
[03:12:00]  You see how Bernard, though?  He sits very close.  He was very close.  He touches you a lot.  He does.  That was a nice watch he had.  He does.  He grabs my arm a little bit.  And I shut up when he does.  It's like, Bernard, I just wanted to say arm grab.  Okay.  He's okay, sir.  Okay.  Okay, sir.  Good point, sir.  Good point, sir.  All right, sir.  You want this back?  No, buddy.  No, no, no.  Of course not.  I was only going to get one glove signed.  He kind of forced you to fucking give this to me.  Dude, he said he offered this sign.  He goes, where's the other one?  I was only going to get one signed.  Take it.  Yeah, you only signed one.  I wasn't going to ask him for both.  He offered it.  You're going to lick it off to that? 
[03:12:30]  I'm going to smear it now.  Of course not.  This is cool.  That's a cool fucking glove.  You kidding me?  That is, dude.  It's fucking...  That's awesome.  The champ.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  Yeah, yeah.  Glucosamine.  We've got to buy some glucosamine.  And remember, glucosamine for those...  For your squeaky joints.  Squeaky joints.  I watch squeaking.  For some reason, it fixed the motherfuckers.  That's like the motto, I think.  Something like that.  Yeah, that's right.  That shit be squeaking.  That shit be squeaking.  Fucking guy.  If that shit be squeaking, get glucosamine. 
[03:13:00]  Glucosamine.  When your shit be squeaking.  Can I say this?  The fucking guy didn't forget about us.  I like that.  No, he just won the belt and he came back.  And he knows he's been coming here for a while.  He's a very cool dude.  He didn't have to.  Are you talking about me?  Of course.  And you just won the belt.  You're the same person.  You're the same person.  I'm sweating like I'm sparring.  Just a stand-up dude, man.  He remembers that you bring shit for him to sign.  Yeah, he asked where the gloves were.  It's like...  I just...  I don't know.  I like that.  I love Philly guys like that. 
[03:13:30]  Because the ones I've met have all been cool.  And Philly has so many fucking fighters, man.  I mean, Hopkins, Meldrick Taylor, fucking Sonny Liston came out of Philly.  There's a lot of very tough fucking dudes from Philadelphia.  Did you say Frazier?  Because I was distracted for a second.  No, I didn't.  I forgot Frazier.  Jesus Christ.  I forgot Joe Frazier.  The biggest one.  Yeah, I forgot Joe Frazier.  That's Keith Robinson.  If Keith Robinson can box.  Joe Frazier and Keith Robinson are really similar.  But he said something that made me...  Like, he would agree with probably about McNabb because of that vibe. 
[03:14:00]  That vibe.  Keith would always say, he got that vibe.  But Keith has a really...  As dumb as Keith is, he has a really good insight into people.  As dumb as he is.  Oh, he is.  He's as stupid as they come.  And I mean Keith, not Bernard.  Yeah, of course.  But Keith has a really good insight into people, man.  He reads people very fucking well.  Yeah, he does.  Yeah.  He's not a dumb guy.  Yeah.  I'm boring.  Sorry, guys.  Hey, Papa.  This was a pleasure, brother.  Yeah, it was fun seeing you guys again.  I'll suck every cock in this room.  Like I haven't.  Once again, the marriage draft starts up Sunday, June 26th at 10 p.m. 
[03:14:30]  Yes.  That's it for us.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks, guys.  Bye-bye.  The Opie and Anthony Show on Sirius XM. </pre>
