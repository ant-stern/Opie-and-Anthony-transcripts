<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a heated discussion about Alex Rodriguez’s legal battles, featuring profanity-laced speculation about his character and relationships.  The hosts also commented on Joe Girardi's reaction to A-Rod getting hit by a pitch.  Jim Norton, a frequent guest, appeared multiple times throughout the show to promote his upcoming comedy special, "American Degenerate," on Epix, and Patrice O'Neal's posthumously released album, "Unreleased," on iTunes.  Norton's segments included discussions about his preference for physical media, his extensive DVD collection, and the unexpected resurgence of cassette tapes.  The hosts revisited a previous, graphically described interview with a man possessing an unusually large scrotum, punctuating the recollection with humorous reactions and reminiscences of past on-air conflicts with advertisers and program directors,  including a memorable juxtaposition of a cancer center commercial featuring Dr. Gil Lederman with circus and Benny Hill music.  The upcoming election was discussed, referencing the scandals of Anthony Weiner and Eliot Spitzer.  Norton shared personal anecdotes about his dating life, and the show concluded with a discussion about Norton's desire for a Bengal kitten, filled with further jokes and banter.

A substantial portion of the show focused on Anthony's contemplation of getting a cat, spurred by numerous cute kitten videos shown on-air.  The hosts debated the challenges of cat training, contrasting it with Anthony’s perceived lack of self-discipline.  A therapist, Steve, called in to surprisingly endorse Anthony getting a cat, suggesting it could be a positive step towards building relationships.  The conversation then rapidly shifted to complaints about a departing intern, Tyler, further promotion of Jim Norton's special and Patrice O'Neal's album (including playing an explicit clip about the differences between "Old Dick" and "Old Pussy"), and a lengthy debate about 80s NFL trivia, specifically which team won the most Super Bowls (the 49ers, and the contributions of Joe Montana and Steve Young).  The discussion then veered into music, covering the hosts' opinions on various artists and radio channels like SiriusXM’s Underground Garage and the Grateful Dead channel. A long, unedited clip of the Grateful Dead's "St. Stephen" was played, eliciting strong negative reactions from the hosts.  The show then featured an interview with Lex Luger, a former professional wrestler, who discussed his autobiography, "Wrestling with the Devil," detailing his struggles with addiction, family loss, spiritual transformation, and a spinal stroke that led to temporary paralysis.  The segment concluded with more Grateful Dead discussion, including calls from "Deadheads" defending the band and their culture,  a longer segment of "Bertha,"  comments about a Hanes commercial featuring visible female pubic hair, and a comparison of Lady Gaga's appearance with and without makeup, all while the hosts continued to express their disdain for the Grateful Dead's music.

A listener call segment followed, characterized by numerous calls and discussions encompassing several topics.  These included the perceived strangeness of Phish and Widespread Panic fans (often described with offensive language), an interview with the mother of a 12-year-old girl who was attacked by a bear (with the hosts offering absurd and offensive suggestions for handling such an attack), further discussion of Anthony Weiner and Bob Filner's scandals, extensive and offensive criticism of Michael Bublé's speech impediment (with imitations), a humorous account of a stolen Amazon package, and a listener's personal encounter with Michael Bublé, further highlighting his speech impediment.  Callers included Aaron (Atlanta), Keegan (New York), Doug (North Carolina), Snowy (Michigan), Don (Alaska), Brian (New York), Chris (Alabama), and a humorous bit involving a caller pretending to be Yogi Bear. Jim Norton's upcoming comedy special was repeatedly promoted.  The segment was filled with frequent interjections from the hosts, offensive language, and crude humor.

The show continued with a segment featuring discussion of Eminem’s new song "Survival," Patrice O’Neal's "Unreleased" CD, and images of Eminem's daughter, Haley.  A segment of Nate Dogg's music was played, acknowledging his passing.  This transitioned into Jim Norton's advice segment, where callers discussed various relationship problems, including a man living with a much younger girlfriend, a husband's sleep-sex issues, difficulties finding a girlfriend, a man whose girlfriend's niece witnessed them having sex, a man whose girlfriend dumped him possibly due to pregnancy, a man finding love through eHarmony, a man whose wife cheated on him, and advice on sex addiction and coping with drinking friends while remaining sober.  Commercials for Dish Network's Hopper and Dollar Shave Club aired throughout this segment.  The hosts and Norton used frequent vulgar and offensive language.

The broadcast concluded with two listener calls.  The first, Sam from Florida, detailed a threesome with his friend and his friend’s wife, describing the experience and expressing subsequent discomfort and uncertainty about his motivations and his relationship with his friend.  The hosts discussed the sexual dynamics and Sam’s feelings.  The second caller, Joe from New York, described his wife's affair with a married police officer and his discovery of continued communication between them after the affair ended.  Joe expressed his hurt and confusion over whether to forgive his wife, with the hosts advising him to prioritize his own well-being and not base his decision solely on material possessions.  A Stephen Singer Jewelers commercial aired during this segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony channel.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive.  Yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What planet are we living on?  It's the Opie and Anthony show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up. 
[00:00:30]  And Anthony.  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R opening, it sounds like a little...  What?  He did a day over here, don't listen a day over here.  Stop.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning, everyone. 
[00:01:00]  Hi.  A-Rod.  A-Rod and Yanks Tangle.  What's the latest on this, Travis?  I know you're all about the A-Rod thing.  It's great.  It's like a daily soap opera.  Yeah.  Yesterday, his lawyer was on the Today Show.  Okay.  That's the old Matt Lauer.  And he was like, yeah, you know, I really wish that we could talk about, you know, all  these charges against A-Rod, but, you know, the confidentiality agreement with MLB, we 
[00:01:30]  can't do it, blah, blah, blah.  Matt Lauer pulls out a letter from MLB saying, like, we're willing to waive all confidentiality  agreements.  For this case, you can talk about whatever you want.  Matt Lauer's like, all I need is your signature, and you can do it.  And he's like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,  He called him out.  That was great.  He totally fucking called him out.  Matt Lauer.  And he folded right there.  That's wonderful.  He said that he's been asking for that agreement for weeks, and that he didn't sign it because 
[00:02:00]  it was a, MLB was doing a publicity stunt giving it to Matt Lauer instead of directly  to him.  Oh, yeah.  But then MLB said, we've never said that players can't talk about the charges against them.  We won't talk about it because it's confidential to us.  But if you want to go out there and talk about the charges against you, go ahead.  So, did the guy sign it after the Matt Lauer interview?  Of course not.  Of course not. 
[00:02:30]  These are the days you miss the old school Steinbrenner.  Oh, Georgie.  He wouldn't put up with any of this shit.  Oh, my God, would he not put up with anything close to this.  You think he would let Alex Rodriguez, while he's talking about how the Yankees are out to get him, play?  Yeah.  Oh, he would probably bench him.  Oh, he would fucking bench him.  He wouldn't give a shit about what his lawyers told him or anything.  Why won't they bench him?  Screw him.  Why won't they bench him?  I don't know.  That's probably some legal wrangling.  And Girardi can do whatever he wants. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, that's true.  And Girardi is in full support of A-Rod.  Getting thrown out of the game the other night after A-Rod got hit.  Even though that is the weirdest fucking thing ever.  Yeah.  Your player gets hit, you run out to defend him, and you get thrown out.  You get tossed.  What the fuck did he say to the umps?  They got him thrown.  He's got to be the guy, though, that if the player is on the field and playing, he's got to be behind him.  Yeah, he's got to protect his player.  Whether personally he fucking can't stand him or not, if the other players see a captain that isn't, or a skipper that isn't fucking taking care of his guys regardless, you lose confidence. 
[00:03:30]  But do you think, you know, behind closed doors?  I think he fucking can't stand the fact that.  He said something to that effect that it's odd to, you know, he said like, you know, we're in difficult times.  We're in strange times.  You think he likes him?  No.  I don't think anyone on the team will.  Not Jeter doesn't like him anymore, you think?  Weren't they good friends?  No, God, no.  You think Jeter doesn't like him either?  If everything that they're saying about him is true, I don't know how any teammate can like him, 
[00:04:00]  because there's allegations that he's throwing other players under the bus and leaking their names to the press.  They got to want him gone just for the fact that it's a distraction from the fucking game.  Sure.  Think he's selfish?  Oh.  Oh, God, yeah.  Oh.  Yes.  Yeah.  All right, so that's the latest on A-Rod.  Every day it's something new.  If only he could get press like this because he played well.  Now that would be great.  He had a home run in Boston.  All right, yeah. 
[00:04:30]  After he got hit.  Right.  Yeah, he's doing all right.  Did he play last night?  I don't even know.  They were off.  Oh, they were off last night?  Okay.  He's about a piece of shit.  Yeah, he really is.  Jimmy's going to be on Imus in about ten minutes.  Yeah.  Even though he's here.  It must be a very quick walk, right?  It's literally...  Across the street.  ...down the elevator, across the banks, up the thing.  Hey, guys, how are you?  That's it.  How are you?  Do I go on ISDN? 
[00:05:00]  It's a big week for Jim Noren.  His comedy special comes out Friday.  Very excited.  On Epix.  10 o'clock.  Yes.  American Degenerate.  It's a good one.  They're all good, obviously, but...  This one I'm really happy with.  I know you're very happy with this one, so...  Compared to the other ones.  Yeah.  And so you're going on Imus to promote a little bit.  I am.  And Patrice's Unreleased is on iTunes today.  Right.  You can get Patrice's Unreleased.  We have advanced copies of it.  And David Cho did the album cover.  It's really cool.  It's hard to get him to do anything, because he's a very, very hard-to-get artist. 
[00:05:30]  He makes a lot of money.  And he did that for free.  He did that for free.  That's awesome.  Yeah, it was nice of him.  Yeah, go get Patrice O'Neill Unreleased.  It's out today for digital download.  And then what?  The hard copies will be out a little later?  October 1st.  October 1st.  You could actually have it in your hand.  Who uses hard copies anymore, if anything?  Travis, is that a gay thing?  Yeah, it's basically...  The homosexual community? 
[00:06:00]  Okay.  They like to touch things.  Yes, I need some tactile.  I gotta touch things.  I don't get...  I just like CDs.  ...hard copies of anything.  It's so much more convenient to just have a digital copy of it on your phone.  And then you could just pop it in your vehicle.  You'd just pop the fucking thing, and now you're listening in your car.  You could use that one digital copy in so many places.  I don't disagree with you.  I still buy CDs, and then I'll import it into iTunes,  and then I'll never listen to the CD again.  But I just like having the physical. 
[00:06:30]  Wow.  In case they come in, you can have them sign it.  It's so silly to hold on to that shit, but I don't.  Oh, you know what?  That is a Jimmy Norton reason right there.  Yes.  I have all my DVD fucking boxes.  They're in a giant box downstairs.  I should throw them out.  Yes.  I want to just throw all my DVDs out.  I'm still too scared to do that for whatever reason.  You know what?  You don't need them.  I have a fuckload of DVDs in a closet, yeah.  I got so many.  I sold almost all of mine.  Really?  Because I realized that it was a dying medium.  Right.  And then I started thinking about when I would get them signed here, 
[00:07:00]  I was like, these are going to look as silly as if I had a bunch of signed VHS tapes.  You know?  That'd be great.  Like, in 10 years, that's going to look nice.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  In a way, depending on the autograph, it could be kind of cool, though.  A little retro.  Yeah.  Put it in a case somewhere in your house.  Well, cassettes are coming back now.  No.  Why are they coming back?  They're doing like, you know how they do Record Store Day?  Yeah.  They did Cassette Store Day a couple weeks ago.  Oh, God.  Stop it.  Cassettes suck.  That was just a fucked medium.  You couldn't even keep them that long.  They would fuck up. 
[00:07:30]  They'd stretch out.  It was a...  Get stuck in your car.  Yeah, yeah.  Enough of you already.  Oh, it's just two words.  Yeah, the heat would really fucking wreak havoc with those things in your car.  Remember when it actually got so hot in your car that the plastic case would warp?  Wait, now Jimmy's leaving.  Yeah, yeah.  I just wanted to come and say hi.  Oh.  You're so weird.  I love Jimmy.  Why would you just hang out? 
[00:08:00]  I know.  I probably should.  You're just so weird.  I'm so used to coming here.  This is my job.  Jimmy works really hard.  I have to show up for work.  He does.  I have to make my face see it and then run across the street and come back to work.  Oh.  What the hell?  You guys sit.  You guys...  You millionaires Philando.  What do I do?  I do the grunt work.  What do I know?  All right.  We'll listen to Jimmy on Imus in a minute.  Yeah.  So you don't even have to change the dial.  Hold down the fort here until Jimmy gets back.  You know what's funny?  If we were doing an interview with Imus today at 6.35...  We'd have taken the day off pretty much. 
[00:08:30]  That's how we are.  Yeah, we're doing an interview.  We wouldn't be here at 6.  We're going to take the day off because...  Jimmy came in to do seven minutes of radio because he's a workaholic.  Yeah, we would have absolutely taken the day off.  I feel like we should take the day off because Jimmy's on Imus.  Because Jimmy's on Imus.  Come on.  We got Imus on.  Imus' cowboy hat is getting bigger.  It is giant.  Bigger.  And he pulls the brim down so it's over his eyes now.  That's what he's doing.  Here's your bobblehead. 
[00:09:00]  And then the other guy was crying like Lou pointed out.  The other guy was not crying.  Blubbering.  Ruben Amaro Jr.  It's Imus McGill.  My George.  Bobblehead now for Charlie.  I'm not like to come over with him.  We're looking at Imus.  Bernard, you've done it again.  He's broadcasting under a huge cowboy hat.  Oh, that doesn't get any better than that.  No, it's terrible.  21 after the hour.  It's coming up in the briefing, Brian.  It sounds like Mr. Magoo now.  Dick Van Dyke and a little more on that Matt Lauer ambush. 
[00:09:30]  Nice.  And something involving Brian Cashman's stalker in this case.  Hello.  It's 21 after the hour.  Jim Norton's here.  Here's one of Norton's five favorite songs.  What?  Somebody.  Somebody put something in my dream.  Somebody.  I have no idea.  I almost said Jim Norton's here.  Jim.  He just left us.  He's not there yet.  How does he do that?  Hmm. 
[00:10:00]  Jimmy runs very quickly.  So Matt Lauer ambushed a ride.  I love it.  Jim Norton's top five songs.  Crazy Train.  Ghost Riders in the Sky.  All right.  Run to the Hills.  And, uh.  National Acrobat.  And Crazy Train.  Oh.  I was going to go with Kajagugu.  Kajagugu.  Too shy.  Too shy shy.  How shy to eye.  Yesterday on the worst of, because, of course, Sam Roberts isn't here until tomorrow, instead  of the after show, it was the worst of.  And I was listening to it on the way home. 
[00:10:30]  And it was me and Jimmy and you and Bobby going through our crappy songs, the gay songs  that we have on our iPhones.  Right.  It was funny.  Yeah.  I was listening to it.  It was, uh.  It was some really bad ones.  Bobby out-gayed all of us, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bobby really did out-gay us all.  All right.  Good.  Jimmy.  Jimmy was pretty good, though.  He's got some real shit on his.  Yeah.  All right.  Now we're just going to wait for Jimmy to cross the street.  Jimmy.  We'll listen to him on iMis. 
[00:11:00]  The iMan.  It's a big week for Jim Norton.  Yeah.  I hope everyone watches his special this Friday at 10 on Epix.  I'm sure.  I'm sure.  Did you?  Did you?  Did you watch the fucking Big Fat Testicle guy?  No.  Why would I?  I didn't either.  I didn't either.  People were like, Anthony, you watching it?  And I'm like, I sat there and spoke with him yesterday.  Right.  Why the fuck do I want to see how disgusting it is?  I felt like I grew a 50-pound testicle listening to him yesterday.  Yeah.  Holy fuck. 
[00:11:30]  He was telling a story in real time.  Wow.  And he would just...  He's one of those guys...  Why are we trashing him?  He was nice.  Fuck.  He was very nice.  But he was one of those guys that tells the story in much too much detail.  In great detail.  So I went to the doctor and I believe he was located in a part of California that doesn't  have a very good viaduct system for water.  And I'm like, wait, wait, where are you going?  He had a lot of those pregnant pauses.  Pregnant ball pauses.  Setting up the story. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Set it up.  I couldn't...  How do you describe his groin area?  Well, you didn't really describe it.  I couldn't describe it.  I even said on Twitter, I couldn't describe it.  It looked like it was just...  Everything was just melted down.  Yes.  It was very elephant looking.  Like if you took an elephant...  Okay.  You know how you see a dead animal on the side of the road and it kind of looks flat?  Yeah.  Squishy.  It looked like an elephant's head.  A miniature pygmy elephant head.  That was...  Flattened out.  That wasn't born yet.  Right, right.  That was kind of pushed up through the skin. 
[00:12:30]  Right?  I couldn't figure it out.  Dude, it was so heinous.  It was weird.  Yes.  Very weird.  We were all bummed because when we booked that interview, we thought the guy still had  his 200-pound testicle.  And who didn't want to see that?  And then Travis had to scold all of us.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Travis scolded us.  He goes, it was in the email.  We were all excited that he'd be wobbling down the hall with this fucking... 
[00:13:00]  This fucking giant medicine ball.  Giant ball bag.  Did you get what he was saying he does with the fucking sweat?  The hoodie?  Yeah.  Dude, it's so sick, right?  Well, online they have pictures of him.  Yeah.  But I didn't understand how he was getting his legs in the sleeves of the hoodie.  I know, right?  You think his big fat legs...  I guess he gets his giant hoodie.  Right.  He wasn't that big of a guy.  I mean, he was big, but I can't figure out how the legs would go into the hoodie.  And then he uses the actual hood to cover up his big, huge ball bag. 
[00:13:30]  Hold up his ball bag.  See, there it is.  Look.  Hoodie's up.  What the fuck?  Hoodie's up for ball bags.  That's a tribute.  And then he has a huge drum that he places his massive testicle on, or testicles.  He kept talking about it like it was only one that, you know...  Jesus.  That only one got out of control.  But it has to be the whole area, right?  Yeah.  His fucking ball bag's wearing a hoodie. 
[00:14:00]  That's hilarious.  That's pretty smart.  Oh, what do you gotta, you know...  Well, how else would you leave the house?  Exactly.  In a fucking giant kilt?  In a dress?  Right.  You have to wear a dress.  You gotta carry that crate around?  He's gotta carry his ball crate around.  It's like, what's the crate for?  Oh, I lost my ball crate.  Right.  I gotta put my balls on it.  Because they're giant.  There's a guy on Cornhus Avenue that sells really shitty books on the side of the road.  Yeah.  In a really shitty car.  And you don't even know how the car got there, because it's filled with more shitty books. 
[00:14:30]  I've never seen that guy.  And he's got a giant ball bag.  Yeah.  But not like that, though.  His is the size of probably like a bowling ball.  Oh, what a faggot.  Yeah.  That's a pussy.  Yeah, now, I thought that was like kind of a freak of nature, and now it's like, eh,  that's nothing.  That's nothing.  Yeah, there he is.  Compared to this guy.  There he is zipping up his hoodie around his big balls.  Hoodies up. 
[00:15:00]  What the...  I don't know.  That is fucked up, dude.  TLC is a great channel.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the freak show channel.  They do.  That is the freak show channel now.  And they make believe they're kind of like teaching you a little something.  The learning channel.  They call it the learning channel.  It should be the oh my god channel.  Yeah.  Holy shit, look at this channel.  They're not kidding anybody.  No.  The man with the 132 pound scrotum sparks flurry of Twitter jokes.  That's very weird when he was talking about the fact that he could smash him and beat him 
[00:15:30]  like a drum.  Right.  And then if he just tapped him.  I think he's just lying.  You think?  Yeah, it's impossible.  Because if you're beating it like a drum, but then you're tapping it, that hurts?  That doesn't make sense.  But there's also, you know, you've got to think of it.  Come on, Travis.  Jenny Johnson.  She's funny.  Oh, Jenny Johnson on Twitter is...  Yeah, she's a fucking superstar.  What'd she write?  Besides 19 kids and counting, and here comes Honey Boo Boo, the man with the 132 pound scrotum 
[00:16:00]  is my favorite TLC show about giant scrotum.  That's not true.  Oh, they might be coming back with Jimmy.  Oh, maybe.  Maybe.  Oh, Jimmy.  Jimmy's here.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  It is 28 FBR.  Here at the hour.  Lips like sugar. 
[00:16:30]  Sugar kisses.  Radio search in New York for a new...  80s on 8.  For new and recurrent cancer treatment.  I can sing it, believe it or not.  Exactly.  Dr. Gil Lederman.  Is this the guy that killed a cancer guy?  Oh, Gil...  Remember Gil Lederman?  Are you kidding me?  Oh, right.  Yeah, I do.  That's him.  Kill the cancer.  No, the cancer.  He sounds retarded, doesn't he?  Well, I know.  That's not the word.  He sounds like he's a sort of a head injury.  Maybe.  He's too excited.  He's too excited.  You can't even see him.  I don't think so. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Anyway, Martin's going on.  Before we get to him, here's Bernie with a briefing.  Good morning, Bernard.  But he's talking about Gil Lederman for a second.  Gil Lederman was that guy.  To treat cancers of the neck, chest, the arms, the throat, ears, ears, to treat cancers of  the earlobe, the eyelashes.  Yeah, he was a real morbid fuck.  Yeah.  We got to write a book on just all the times we got in trouble.  In trouble. 
[00:17:30]  Because we used to put clown music behind his commercials.  Yeah, they never put a bed to the cancer commercial that he used to do, so we decided it would  be better to put a bed behind it.  Well, we were all creeped out, man.  We were doing this big fucking radio show at NEW, and they had the cancer guy.  Oh, God.  And it just brought everyone down, so we figured if we had circus music, it would be cool.  I'm Dr. Gil Lederman for the Staten Island Cancer Center.  We used stereotactic surgery for cancers of the foot, toe, toenail, ankle, ankle, bone, 
[00:18:00]  shin.  Right.  He'd come up with these fucking wacky ones you never heard of.  Oh, my God.  And we put like...  To try to make it...  To bring it up a little.  Boy, did we get in trouble for that.  And the Benny Hill music.  Yeah, yeah.  The Benny...  I forgot we put Benny Hill music to it, too.  Oh, was that terrible?  You've noticed over the years after these guys stopped working with us that they, like,  gained about 10 years?  Yeah.  It's kind of like when a president leaves office. 
[00:18:30]  These program directors and general managers, you see them a few years down the road, you're  like, wow, you look great.  Right.  What have you done with your life?  I fucking got rid of you two.  Ken Stevens is a prime example of that.  Oh, my God.  He looked amazing when I saw him.  Out on his boat, he looked like a Kennedy after he was done fucking decompressing from  this show.  And when he was working with us, he looked like W.C. Fields.  Everything on him was red and small.  Remember how everything, like his clothes would be hanging off him, he'd be dragging 
[00:19:00]  that suitcase in, miserable that he had to come in and see us again?  He liked us.  He did like us, but it was just terrible that he had to deal with the show.  He wasn't that guy.  And he always supported us.  When we got in trouble with Howard and had to go march and meet Mel Karmazin in the middle  of some wonderful holiday season.  He was very angry.  Remember, he would walk down the sidewalk with us, fully supporting us, but he wouldn't  talk to us. 
[00:19:30]  Poor Ken.  I miss Ken Stevens.  Yeah, he's a good sort.  Put a picture up on Facebook there, Iraq, of Ken Stevens and the giant pen.  The giant pen.  Sounds like a kid's movie.  Ken Stevens and the giant pen.  Well, because then we were assholes.  He wanted us to sign a contract that we just refused.  There was no reason to refuse.  We just wanted to be assholes.  And so he figured that if he comes in with a giant pen, we'll sign the contract.  Yeah.  Yeah, he came out with a wacky giant pen. 
[00:20:00]  Giant pen.  Oh.  Run to the hills.  Run for your life.  Run to the hills. 
[00:20:30]  Run to the hills.  I'm so bummed you weren't here the day we beat the shit out of Eddie Trunk, me and Jay  Moore.  I listened.  Because he didn't put Run to the Hills on the greatest Iron Maiden song list.  He put the Too Cool for the Room track.  We killed him for that.  You have to put Run to the Hills.  I understand if you don't want to take the popular songs and put it on because the Too  Popular, with some instances.  Right.  But with that, if you don't fucking put Run to the Hills on when you're talking about 
[00:21:00]  Iron Maiden.  I get it.  You've got to pick something a little different.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, stop.  But I mean, stop.  That song, please.  Right.  You got it.  That was a fun day.  Yeah.  Run to the hills.  We're just waiting for Jimmy to be on.  Jimmy.  I miss.  They were teasing him.  They're using him for TSL, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Time spent listening.  What?  Do you want that bit for this week's podcast?  I was going to ask you.  Oh.  Hey.  What have we got here?  We still don't know what we're doing for tomorrow's podcast. 
[00:21:30]  We've got a company man here.  What have we got here?  We've got to figure it out weeks in advance.  E-Rod.  I guess we made Huffington Post with our scrotum interview.  Oh, yeah.  Huffington.  There was a quick mention of you guys.  Man, do I hate the sound of just Huffington Post.  That's why you say Huff Poe.  Huff Poe.  Yeah.  Is that like Moe Poe with Maury Povich?  He tried doing that thing.  Whatever happened to Maury?  Is he still around?  Why doesn't he do our show anymore?  What happened with him?  Wakes up in cold sweats thinking of primordial dwarfs. 
[00:22:00]  Ah.  Good old Maury Povich.  Maury.  He's 74.  Maury is.  Maury is 74.  He looks great.  Maury's doing something right.  Yeah.  I like the Maury.  Mm-hmm.  He was always fun on the Poe Gram.  The Maury Poe Gram.  Jimmy, Jimmy, where's the Norton?  Right after the commercial, so.  It's all good.  That's the Kansas City Puy. 
[00:22:30]  I want to do this.  I saw the guy from Rick Harrison there from the pawn shop thing.  He's doing a Razor commercial.  Who?  Yeah.  It was late last night.  And he comes on and he's just like, hey, you can get this Razor.  And he's at the pawn store and he's talking about like, I was like, oh, look at him.  He's doing Razor commercials.  Oh.  Good egg.  Rob Bartlett just wrote, Jesus.  Jimmy looks great. 
[00:23:00]  Oh.  How's by you, bro?  The, uh.  Oh, there's the giant pen from Ken Stevens.  It's up on our face.  Oh, I remember that.  Look at the giant pen.  Boy, with no context, you wouldn't know what the fuck that picture is.  It looks like a musket or something, doesn't it?  Kind of suit.  Fuck.  God fucking.  How many years ago is that now?  Oh, God.  Was that 12 years ago, maybe?  I can't even.  We just passed the 11th, uh, the 11th year anniversary of our firing. 
[00:23:30]  Jesus.  For the Sex for Sam thing.  I can't even fathom how these fucking years just whiz by with this shit.  Exactly.  No.  I was watching some shit.  That would be our flying car.  Yeah.  No.  Hold on a minute here.  So the morning program on the Fox Business Network.  Where?  Here's Diane Macedo.  Good morning, everyone.  Oh, my God.  He doesn't even have to do a show.  He just throws it to people.  Fuck.  That's what he does.  I'm going to throw it to you. 
[00:24:00]  I'm going to throw it around the room.  I'm going to throw it around.  What do you got?  Do a time check.  Do the weather.  Do the fucking business report.  Go to sports.  Go to Bernie.  Go to this.  Well, I can't.  Dr. Gil Edelman.  We'll be back with Jim Lorton.  You're going to be on the program.  Fuck.  I got my hat steamed yesterday.  I'm in the morning.  She's fucking beautiful, though.  She's a very attractive girl that, uh, what's her name?  I don't know.  She's got those lips. 
[00:24:30]  She's, uh, she's got a little booty.  Ah!  Wow.  A little drop-off.  ...pattern shifts, especially across sections of the Northeast, where we're finally returning  to more summer-like weather, like in New York City, where today...  Summer's a fucking piece of shit in the Northeast here.  Is it a time to...  Piece of shit.  Is it a time to get rid of the TV weather fucking report?  Yeah.  This is time, right?  When you can just...  ...over the last several days...  ...pick up your phone.  ...otherwise in the Southeastern U.S., you've had this software boundary out here for... 
[00:25:00]  But they know, that's why they get the hot broads to do it.  Yeah, they're trying.  Trying to keep that going.  Over the next several days, it will remain out here...  The news is trying everything to just keep the old institutions going.  Right.  ...and good luck to you, because I think the only people watching it are the old fogies.  And when they die often, then it's done.  Oh, back to her.  Yay.  ...at futures now.  We've got red arrows across the board, though not by huge amounts.  Now futures are down six points.  What's it been?  Three days in a row?  Three days, Market Town?  Oh, really?  Four days today?  I think we're...  We're going to be in a... 
[00:25:30]  ...with a problem.  Coming up!  Next!  Holy shit!  What the fuck?  This is hilarious.  What are they doing?  Man, I want to...  I know.  I want to be back on regular radio.  You forget, like, how many commercials are you doing?  Just commercials, and you just throw it around.  You just throw it around.  It's great.  You just throw the ball around.  There's a stock report and some weather. 
[00:26:00]  Now we'll be back.  We're here in the I'm Swayne program.  Please welcome down to the program.  Opie and Anthony's program, the great Jim Norton.  Good morning, Norton.  Hi, I miss.  How are you?  Hi, baby.  How are you?  I'm good, man.  I'm actually...  I wanted to walk in and just say the hack thing.  Like, how do you guys do this every morning?  I'm literally tired, and I feel like I've never done morning radio before.  Don't you do it with Opie and Anthony every morning?  Oh, yeah, I do.  I was just saying that was kind of the ironic part, is that I do it every day, and I feel  like I shouldn't be here right now.  I should be in bed.  How are they doing, by the way?  They're good.  I mean, like any married couple, I mean, you know, they're happy one day and unhappy 
[00:26:30]  the next.  They're happy with each other, though, so they have management to hate, so it's kind  of nice.  I was wondering if they...  I know Opie a lot better than I do Anthony, but...  Yes, I keep it close to the vest.  I was wondering if they have a Mike and Amanda idea where they ever had fights and all that  stuff, but it goes...  They get along pretty good, actually.  I mean, for a long time...  I mean, I think they just understand that they're different.  Like, you know what I mean?  Opie understands that he has a life that's kind of, like, happy and family-oriented,  and Anthony drinks like William Holden. 
[00:27:00]  I mean, that's pretty much the entire relationship.  And I'm kind of like this stupid codependent son in the middle, just trying to make sure  mom and dad are happy.  It's a good situation for me.  Norton's new comedy special, American Degenerate, premieres on Epix in three days on August 23rd  at 10 p.m.  You know, please be offended, I saw online, but is Epix, is that something you can get  on television, too, or is this a stupid question?  No, it's a good question.  I mean, people never usually ask that. 
[00:27:30]  They're usually like, what's Epix?  And I try to explain it, and they go to break.  It's a network, a Viacom network.  It's not on every provider, so you can go to epixhd.com, because a lot of people watch  it online when they can't get it on their own provider, because I don't even know where  it is on my cable system or on Fios, whatever I have.  So if you don't know where it is, just go to epixhd.com, and you can watch it there.  It's confusing.  You live in New York City?  Yeah, I do.  I'm on the west side, about 20 blocks.  I still walk in late for work, I'm 20 blocks from work, and I still cannot get my ass 
[00:28:00]  in by 6 o'clock.  You must live near me and Warner.  I don't know where you live, and I see Warner every day at the gym, and I say hi, and he  walks by me like I'm attacking him with a hammer.  Oh, I didn't know that was you.  I love Warner Wolf.  Sorry, man.  You doing any meat gays on a Warner?  No, but there is a guy, I've never seen Warner in the locker, I would love to catch him,  I got my cell phone ready. 
[00:28:30]  But Opie and I go to the same gym as Warner, and there is a couple of meat gaysers in there,  and there's one guy who always sits in this one, it's like the catbird seat, where he  can see down three banks of lockers, and he's always on his cell phone, I'm like, I know  he's filming, and he's trying to catch me, so believe me, I turn towards him and I lasso  every chance I get.  You guys were talking about that one day, weren't you? 
[00:29:00]  You were talking about how it changed your feeling about looking at women.  What was that all about?  Oh, probably the idea that I just felt very sexualized, and it was really creepy, because  just to catch this guy catching little gross peeks at me, because his locker is kind of  catty-cornered to me, and I'm actually, I'm something to look at in a locker room nude.  Like, here I'm very mediocre, but I'm completely hairless and pale, I'm like a tall infant when 
[00:29:30]  I'm nude, and I catch this guy trying to, like, catch little glimpses at me, and I just  felt like really sexualized, I'm like, that's how I make women feel, and it's just kind of  disgusting and gross.  I still do it, but now I know how it feels.  Yeah.  Talking with Jim Norton, his new comedy special, American Degenerate, premieres on August 23rd  on Epix, you're on epixhd.com and figure it out. 
[00:30:00]  That's like a cartoon character, now with that hat.  It just can't be that difficult.  And I'm already chastising people, and all I'm going to mean is there's no reason to.  It's not at 10 p.m., so do you, by saying, so, have you picked a candidate in New York  you're going to vote for, or are you interested in that at all?  It's, well, Wiener and Spitzer, I can't decide who represents me better.  I mean, it's one of those guys.  I mean, obviously, I've spent a lot of money on prostitutes, so I kind of like Elliot Spitzer 
[00:30:30]  for that, except he was arresting guys like me, which is really irritating.  So I think Wiener is probably the best, because everyone's like, well, I want a guy who represents  the people, but what better represents the average man than sending a photo of your penis  and getting it caught and then doing it again?  So I think Wiener is the greatest candidate for me, and I think he should be for you, too,  even though his politics suck.  I don't agree with what anyone says.  You know, I never, did we ever find out Bernie or Jim, did anybody ever ask Wiener, any of 
[00:31:00]  these women ever say, hey, send me a picture of your penis?  I don't know if she asked for it or if he just volunteered it.  I mean, it's from my own experience, a lot of times I'll hint to it, like, hey, you don't  want a picture of my penis, do you?  You know, and they'll usually go, no, LOL, but I'm like, too late.  It was always consensual with Wiener.  It was never, you know, unsolicited, in other words.  They would ask for it, and he would just kind of send it off. 
[00:31:30]  Basically, he was just a servant.  Like, you know, we asked him for something, and he gave it to us.  Well, he delivered.  Yeah.  So these women ask Wiener for a picture of his penis?  That's what's going on.  Yeah.  It was a little sexual foreplay conversation, sort of, and next thing you know, boom.  Is there anything better than that?  When you send that to a girl, and she writes back, wow.  That would be...  You realize you didn't send yours?  No, I sent the black one.  Sorry. 
[00:32:00]  Well, I don't know.  I'm more...  Well, I'm just...  I couldn't decide.  I think I'm...  I think I'm more...  I think I am more offended by Spitzer because of the hypocrisy.  The fact that he was going after guys and targeting guys, I kind of agree, and he seems  like he's just...  He just seems like more of a creep.  Like, even though Wiener's more of a degenerate, there's just something almost hopeless about  Wiener.  Like, he just can't help... 
[00:32:30]  He can't keep his hand off it.  Like, there's something relatable about Wiener, whereas Spitzer's the kind of guy who will  do it and then target you for it.  Any interest in A-Rod, not hold ill?  I just...  I don't know whether to love him or hate him.  Like, a part of me loves him just because he's just so sociopathic and the fact that  he won't admit anything.  It's like O.J. standing with a severed head.  I didn't do nothing.  There's something about that that I kind of respect.  And I love the fact that, like, Yankee fans are now in this quandary.  Like, we hate this guy's guts, but we kind of have to root for him when he's up. 
[00:33:00]  And when he gets pegged to the baseball, we're all kind of happy, but we have to fight  for him.  So, uh, he's just a distraction and kind of a bum, so he'll go eventually.  Kind of a bum.  It's, uh, from 15 to the hour, talking with, uh, Jim Norton, whose stand-up special premieres  on Epix on August 23rd at, uh, at, uh, 10 p.m.  So, uh, Lindsay Lohan, any answers to you?  I'd love to sleep with her.  You know, I like the fact that she's kind of a disaster, and I bashed her, and her father  got really mad at me and bashed me on Radar Online, and, uh, you know, he got very offended 
[00:33:30]  that I was trashing his daughter.  But it's like, I'm kind of happy that she's sober now, but it just kind of decreases  my odds of getting her in bed.  I like, I like a good disaster, you know, a good vomiting out the passenger window type  of Lindsay Lohan.  But I hope she gets sober, even though she'll, she'll probably never sleep with me that she  is sober.  But, uh, I don't really follow it.  I mean, Oprah paid two million for the interview.  Good for Oprah.  I'd have sex with her, too.  Have you ever been married, Jim?  No.  No.  I mean, I've never, I've never lived with a woman. 
[00:34:00]  I've never been engaged, um, two years is the longest I've ever come, and I just, no  woman wants to put up with my shenanigans.  It's literally, I sexed until one o'clock in the morning.  I have Sabbath pictures on the wall.  There's no woman that wants to, like, you know, wants to have the child of me.  So, no.  I've never lived with a woman.  I've never been close to it.  Okay.  Sorry, I didn't mean to bring the show to a halt with that realistic, honest answer.  No, I just, I just see you and Guns hanging out together, because Guns is, uh, but Guns  thinks, see, you think, do you know who Guns is? 
[00:34:30]  He works with Warren?  Uh, I don't.  No.  Okay.  Well, but Guns is a fan of yours, too, by the way.  Oh, thank you, Guns.  Huge fan.  Huge fan.  Yeah, definitely.  Oh, where are you?  But, uh, Guns is, are you?  How old are you, Guns?  Uh, I've just turned 26 in June.  Okay.  Guns thinks he has a shot with Carly.  You met Carly, right, Norton?  Yeah, she's, the girl who took me up in the elevator, she's fantastic, and she has, she  has, like, a, a giant, uh, she has a, a five-pound rock on her left finger.  You have no shot.  We can overlook that, though.  Until it actually happens, we're all set, you know what I'm saying? 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, I don't know why I'm saying that, like, that would deter you.  Right.  Exactly.  I'm a fan of you.  Because that wouldn't deter you, would it, Guns, Guns, Guns, Guns, Guns, Guns, Guns?  No, not at all.  I wouldn't, her husband could hold the camera.  I mean, she's a delight.  She's a lovely girl.  A little to the left, Norton.  It would be more like, you finished already, Norton?  Yep, got to go, guys.  Forget wiener picks.  Just do that.  Holy shit. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, man.  Great job.  I love to laugh.  These Fox girls are amazing.  It's an amazing building, man.  Every girl.  There's nothing under an eight here at Fox.  It beats the club.  You should say that outside.  Security.  Nothing under an eight.  Did I just get in trouble?  No, you didn't.  Say hi to ONA, man.  I love them to death.  And you, too.  Thank you, Imus.  And Patrice O'Neal's new CD, He Passed Away, is out today on iTunes. 
[00:36:00]  It's called Unreleased.  All the money goes to his family.  Thank you for having me on, buddy.  I appreciate it.  You're calling it any time, man.  Well, the great Jim Norton, August 23rd on Ethics, and you can hear him on Opie and Anthony  on Sirius XM.  It is 12 minutes out until the hour.  That's great.  I killed it.  Fucking killed it.  I remember that one time, Jimmy got mad because Imus said something like, well, he comes on  here.  I thought it was going to be funny.  Right, right, right.  And I guess he was doing more of a straight-up kind of an interview thing that time.  Well, boy, there's no way he fucking made up for it there. 
[00:36:30]  He brought the funny.  That was very fucking funny, man.  Right on.  Good for Jimmy.  God damn.  I love when you hear the background people, the camera guys and the fucking producers and  stuff laughing in the background.  Because those guys are the bitter ones.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They've seen it all, so you get a reaction out of them.  You know you're doing all right.  That was great.  Jimmy!  Fucking job.  Nice.  Ha ha!  Jimmy!  He's right about Warner Wolf, though. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah?  Warner Wolf's one of my heroes, too, man.  Yeah, we've watched him forever.  When I was growing up, he was the sports guy in New York.  Yep.  And for a while there, I thought I wanted to go into sports casting because of Warner  Wolf.  And now I see him at the gym, and I've said hi to him, too.  But he walks around not approachable.  Yeah.  He's very different on Imus.  Isn't the gym a weird place, though, to meet people?  Well, we have like a lunchroom, kind of.  Ooh.  A gym is this.  But he doesn't buy anything.  He brings a soda and a sandwich in a sandwich bag and sits down. 
[00:37:30]  Does his wife make his arm as he married?  So he's not really approachable.  I don't know.  Because, oh, wow.  So it's funny what Jimmy said about him.  Ha ha!  He doesn't like...  The gym just seems to be a weird place to like, hey, how you doing?  Yeah.  Leave you alone.  I'm fucking, you know.  No, I mean, yeah, no one really talks at our gym.  Yeah, yeah.  They're all fucking stuck up.  Do you and Jimmy have little chit-chats?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  At the gym, yeah?  Yeah, as we're pulling each other's puds. 
[00:38:00]  Nice.  Ha ha!  Puds.  Just helping each other out.  Yeah, you know, a couple of boys.  Before we get into some reps.  Yeah.  Before we pump iron.  Nice.  We pump our puds.  I haven't been to the gym in, I don't know, when did summer start?  Oh, really?  Well, that's why I dig holes every day.  Oh.  That's my workout.  That's the workout now.  And now I'm digging holes for the entire fucking beach. 
[00:38:30]  The word got out.  Who knew there was a demand?  The word got out.  Such a demand for holes.  The kids come a-running when they see me with the big shovel.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  But they won't fucking let me complete the goddamn hole before they start pushing the  sand back in.  Ah, damn kids.  Drives me nuts.  What are you going to do?  My wife had to tell me to relax because I wasn't yelling.  I don't yell at my kids because I know what that did to me when I was growing up.  But I get really frustrated.  Push in the hole!  I get really frustrated because all I want to do with my digging is hit water. 
[00:39:00]  You're right.  I'm a little obsessive at times.  Oh, that's a...  If you're going to dig a hole, you want to hit water if you're at a beach.  That's all.  And I'm getting close.  The sand is getting damper.  And you know it's right about there.  Oh, it's any minute now.  And then my kid runs around the top of the hole.  All he wants to do is push the sand back in.  Why doesn't...  And then I'm like, not yet!  And then my wife's got to go relax.  She's having fun.  And I'm like, but I'm not having fun. 
[00:39:30]  Why wouldn't he enjoy doing that knowing that Dad will just shovel it out again?  But he doesn't want me to shovel it out again.  What?  Don't even ask why.  Fill the hole up.  You try to figure out why.  If I knew why, man.  I have no clue.  It'd be a lot easier to, you know, raise a kid.  I gather.  And then as soon as it's done, he's all about...  He jumps in the middle of it.  It's over his head.  That's how deep these holes are.  Oh, man.  That's dangerous.  And then he just starts scraping the sides like this and just wants to pull it all back in. 
[00:40:00]  That's dangerous.  No, we're right there.  Oh, my God.  And I...  Oh, that's so dangerous.  No, I'm following the codes.  This sand is crazy stuff.  No, you've got to follow the codes.  Yeah?  Yeah, I cut some things.  I cut it to the side of it, so...  Oh, really?  If there is some kind of collapse, it isn't going to be that bad.  Yeah, I got all sorts of codes.  Codes?  Oh.  My whole day.  I didn't know you were proficient.  Well, that's pretty much the only exercise I've had all summer.  Yeah.  Because I'm, like, all about just fucking chilling the fuck out. 
[00:40:30]  What is Travis laughing at?  It's certainly not my dumb story.  Eric is.  Eric is making a joke.  Eric is.  In my ear.  What did you say?  You wouldn't get it.  In your rear?  Yeah.  Oh.  In your rear.  All right.  I don't have...  Obviously, I don't have kids.  But I'm still searching for my little cat.  I'm looking for a cat.  Nice.  I'm looking for a little bangle kitten.  That's not a good idea.  No, it's a great idea.  Why don't you go rescue one?  Fuck that.  They got kittens down there all the fucking time.  I want a bangle. 
[00:41:00]  I want a little spotted bangle kitty.  You can't find the good ones in the rescue.  Oh, really?  No.  That's why.  Fuck the rescue cat.  There's a reason they're in there.  How's their temperament?  Well, they could be a little rambunctious, but I like that in a cat.  I don't know.  Little Jack-Jack was rambunctious.  No, he wasn't.  You have that in your online profile?  Jack-Jack was rambunctious.  Jack-Jack was half fucking human.  That was a creepy cat.  No, that was J.D.  Oh, Jack-Jack.  J.D.  Oh, you're right.  J.D.  Jack-Jack was Melinda's cat. 
[00:41:30]  No, you're right.  J.D.  Right, right, right.  Yeah.  J.D.  J.D.  was very cool.  J.D.  was a dog, basically.  Yeah, yeah.  It was creepy how he behaved.  I could like tap my shoulder and the cat would jump right up on my shoulder from the couch  and stuff.  Like a little parrot.  It's adorable.  A little parrot.  But now I'm looking for, you know, I have a couple of calls in to a couple of catteries.  Nice.  For a little Bengal kitty.  They're adorable and they're fun.  Play with them.  Meow. 
[00:42:00]  Meow.  Why don't you take J.D. when it all went bad?  Because you really liked J.D.  You know what?  It would have been another battle that I would have had.  That's all I need to do is get into a custody battle over a cat with my fucking ex-wife.  Oh, my God.  It was bad enough trying to keep custody of my money.  I left two kids.  I think I told a story on the air.  I left two cats behind when my relationship with my dad many years ago at this point.  And I had the cats for, it had to be 10 years. 
[00:42:30]  And then she gives the cats to some gay couple.  Oh.  And they changed.  And they changed, I've heard, they changed the name of the cats after 12 years.  Really?  Because they didn't like the names that I picked out many years ago.  Well, you probably didn't have good gay-friendly names.  Well, my cats were Babe for B-A-B because I had found it in the parking lot.  So it was B-A-B-E. 
[00:43:00]  Okay.  Dom, I know.  And I called a, I thought I had a male cat for many years until we took it to the vet.  Whoops.  And then it turned out to be a female.  Whoops.  And, you know, her name was Bono.  Oh.  All right.  Bono.  Good old Bono.  Named after my U2 obsession.  And for people saying...  And then she, 12 years, she can't handle the cats anymore, gives it to this fucking gay  couple somewhere in Huntington, and they changed the name of the cats.  That's it.  No more record of you ever owning it. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, but they're not going to fucking all of a sudden go, oh, this is my new name.  Oh.  You don't think they'd do that after a while?  What do you mean?  Like, they'd just get used to being called something else.  After, after 10 to 12 years, you think a cat's going to recognize its new name?  I don't think animals know that much time went by.  Yeah.  They're just like, I don't know, what, it's been a week?  Yeah.  Yeah, my new name?  Sure.  Yeah, we're gone for eight hours, and we get home, and our dog is like, hey, that was quick.  And I, yeah.  And now I'm getting these things, people going, don't be a faggot, get a dog. 
[00:44:00]  Fuck you.  Like, I need a cat you can fucking leave for a while, and go away, like, to Vegas for  a week or something.  Yeah, but cats are assholes.  I know.  I don't mind.  Nine out of ten cats are assholes.  You know that.  I don't mind.  I don't mind a nice asshole cat.  We're just, fuck them, they're aloof.  We're good.  I don't need, I don't have time for you either.  That's my logic.  I love when we talk about cats, and I know it's like a broken record, I love talking 
[00:44:30]  about cats, because I had one really cool cat and one asshole cat.  Oh.  And all you're trying to do is take care of the goddamn thing, and it hisses and fucking  scratches you.  You gotta be nice.  Dude, you killed it.  Jimmy.  Jimmy, you killed it.  That was fucking great.  Jimmy came back with his sunglasses on.  Oh, was that fucking great?  Thanks.  You were cracking up.  You killed it, man.  Thank you.  It wasn't that, uh, doing it on the ISDN like that, with the screen, you, there's  like a microsecond delay.  Yeah.  Right.  So it's like, I don't know what to look at the screen, because they have a giant screen. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Just looking at Imus?  It really was a giant Imus.  And his giant cowboy hat, where you can't see his eyes?  No, you can from that close up.  Oh, okay.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's nice to curse.  But yeah, it was cool.  It was not that hard being on ISDN.  I thought it might be good.  You got a black dick joke in.  Nice.  Oh, yeah, nice.  Absolutely.  And Imus laughed.  I wasn't sure how he was going to handle the racial humor.  Yeah.  I figured he would ask about everybody, so I'm glad we chatted about him.  Oh, it was great.  You were killing everybody behind the scenes. 
[00:45:30]  You hear them all laughing.  Right.  You got it.  You're talking about the joke with the girl there, and the fox is full of AIDS.  Wow.  Oh, she is.  She's a delight.  I said AIDS, not AIDS, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay.  You scared me.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Is she amazing?  She has a rock on her finger, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Lovely girl.  That was good, man.  Thank you.  Female Bengals piss everywhere.  Not everybody.  That's what they're saying.  Well, if everyone's saying it, then maybe it's true.  I didn't say that's what everybody says. 
[00:46:00]  I didn't mean that.  What I meant to say is everyone's got something to say.  Like, they all got something.  No matter what the fuck you say you want, I want this.  You know, shut it.  Just shut it.  Whoa.  Look, they're adorable little cats.  Aw, look.  Squeezing from underneath the door.  I'm looking for a little kitty.  It's a baby and a kitty.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  I will never get a cat again.  Fuck cats.  Let me tell you something, though.  You want a video to fucking fly viral, man. 
[00:46:30]  Let me tell you something.  I'm good with viral videos.  Thank you very much.  How about Bengal?  I could check that fucking goal off.  Distressed little Bengal tiger in a raptor mouth.  Yeah.  Gowing.  Oh, that'll be fucking six million views right there.  I really want to do Kitten Day.  Kitten Day would be great.  Can we do Kitten Day?  How do we get kittens in here?  I've got to get a kitten.  And then we've got to get all sorts of dumb things.  Travis, did you just bring them in? 
[00:47:00]  How?  Where do we get kittens?  ASPCA.  Oh, no.  Yeah, but then we've got to do something.  Yeah, then we've got to deal with those.  Yeah.  Trash compactor.  Maybe like Stephen Bay.  Huh?  Stephen Bayshore has kittens.  Stephen Bayshore, he's like an old cat lady.  He really is.  He's got kitties in his house.  Yeah.  Kitten in a blender?  Has that been done yet online?  Oh, my God, no.  I'm not turning on the blender.  Kittens with dangerous things.  Has it been done online? 
[00:47:30]  I need to know.  I'm sure it has.  Yeah.  Want me to check?  No, that's mean.  How many views does that have?  54 million.  Dude, you can't lose with a cat video.  They're amazing.  Cat videos are fucking like, they're the number one thing on the fucking internet.  It's crazy.  Everyone loves funny cats.  They love a good kitten video.  Cats are idiots.  Cats really are a wonderful little cute.  I'm looking for a Bengal kitten. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  As we speak.  How big is a Bengal?  Do they shed or no?  Regular size.  Normal size.  Do they shed?  No, they have short hair.  That's better.  So they don't have like...  What do they look like?  I don't even know what a Bengal cat looks like.  They're...  Put Bengal kittens.  As soon as I see it, I'll go, oh, okay.  We had a manx when I was a kid.  They're adorable.  Look at the little guy.  Yeah.  He is cute.  Oh!  Yeah, they're adorable.  I want that.  Would you declaw them or no?  I'm reading about...  Nah, I don't give a shit.  You don't care about the furniture, right?  No, I don't know. 
[00:48:30]  Just get the scratching post.  And some cat...  What's scratching daily news?  Go ahead.  Oh, look at the little guy.  Meow.  Oh.  I'll come home.  It'll be there for me.  I'll be like, yay.  The rug will be all ripped up.  That's funny.  It's the same thing Anthony says about a bottle.  We laugh because it's true.  Yeah. 
[00:49:00]  It's going to have fucking piss and scratch.  No.  That's going to hiss at you.  It's not even going to be aware that you're taking care of it.  It's...  It's...  God, I hate cats.  No, no, no.  Don't let me...  I'm going to be trained properly.  And you're going to do that?  Yes.  Oh, really?  You're going to train something that doesn't want to listen?  I have plenty of time on my hands once I get home to train the little kitty.  And I have help.  There's people that will, you know, give me pointers.  I don't know.  And, uh...  I think this is a bad idea.  No, it's a great idea. 
[00:49:30]  Look how cute it is.  It's adorable.  And I hear tell they aren't afraid of water.  They aren't?  No.  They actually like, uh, water.  Could you see that video?  Bengal kitten swimming in pool.  Whoa.  18 million views.  Here's the video I can see.  Man named Big A arrested for accidentally sitting on cat like Christopher Maltasanti.  No.  As he's tiptoeing around the compound.  Oh, my goodness. 
[00:50:00]  Getting sneaky video.  Yeah, getting snippets of interviews.  Terrible.  Getting snippets of interviews.  This one's already got 4 million views.  Bengal cat walks on water.  It walks on water?  Wow.  Oh, there's a cover on the pool.  Okay.  That's going to be funny.  Wait, this is all it did and it got 4 million?  Almost 5 million views?  5 million views.  That's very dangerous with the cover on like that.  Yes, it is.  The solar cover.  He's thinking about it, though.  If he slips in...  He's touching it.  Oh, boy, is he ever. 
[00:50:30]  He's trying to figure it out.  They can swim.  I mean...  Yeah, but under the cover.  They're not going to get under the cover.  But if he falls in there and the cover goes whoosh, and then he's under the cover.  Well, at least there's a responsible owner filming the whole thing.  Oh, okay.  He's testing the cover.  Oh, he wants to go.  Oh, I don't know.  He's thinking about it.  Is he going to go?  He's got two...  No.  Oh, man.  What an apprehensive little cat.  He's got one paw on the cover again.  5 million views.  Two paws on the cover.  Both front legs.  Here I go.  Nope.  Goes back. 
[00:51:00]  This other cat goes, what the fuck are you doing?  You do that, I'll smell your asshole for a second.  Right.  All right.  Nope.  5 million views.  He's...  He never does anything.  No.  He just tries and never quite...  He can't figure it out.  He's like, it's water, but it's not.  Now he looks around.  Like, yeah, fucked it.  That's 5 million views?  5 million views has got no finish.  Boom.  It just ends. 
[00:51:30]  Let's do Kitten Day.  Got to do Kitten Day.  How great would Kitten Day be?  It'd be great until you realize you have cat hair all over you and you're fucking sneezing  and your eyes itch.  Oh, look.  It's in the bathtub.  How many views?  This is only 30 pounds.  30 pounds.  That's crazy.  Yeah, that's bullshit.  Hold on.  We got to go to Steve the therapist.  Oh, here we go.  I guess this is our new therapist.  Are you sure it's the therapist and he didn't just put two words together?  The rapist.  I guess he's taking it over for Lydia, huh?  Whatever happened to Lydia? 
[00:52:00]  I don't know.  Those big tits of hers.  Steve.  Yes?  Hi, boys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hello.  Hi, Steve.  I have to speak in favor of Anthony getting a cat.  Oh.  This is Anthony making a committed, long-term relationship.  This is very positive progress for him.  It is, right?  You know, it's something that he's going to love.  Something that's going to love him back.  He's going to give him conditional love.  If he's successful with this, he may graduate to a relationship where he could do this. 
[00:52:30]  Oh.  Thank you, Steve.  That's a one in the plus column.  Yeah, I think this is a good idea.  I said go for it.  Well, this will be the final nail in Anthony's human contact coffin.  He barely needs people as it is now.  It'll just be him and his cat with a fucking pistol on his leg and a bottle in his right hand.  Exactly.  Oh, look at the poor little guy. 
[00:53:00]  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  I'll punch it out, guys.  I think it's, uh, that's your food.  I think it's break time.  Oh, my God.  So here's what's going on today.  No, no fucking, no, no.  It's not fun to get the food anymore, is it?  No.  No.  Oh, Jackie, thank you.  Oh, Sidney, thank you.  Now it's like...  That's the guy that took over for Jackie and Sidney?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  How long has he been here, Iraq?  Uh, before the girls.  What?  What?  What's his name? 
[00:53:30]  His name is Tyler.  Oh.  When's his last day?  Friday.  Oh.  Oh, it is?  Oh, good luck to you.  Good luck to you.  And that isn't even a joke.  Good luck.  Hey, a picture?  A picture?  I gotta get out of here.  Goodbye.  Take it by the elevator.  Meanwhile, we're fucking sitting here 20 minutes after 10, listening to Jackie be serenaded last fucking two weeks ago.  So, this guy will get... 
[00:54:00]  Oh, yeah.  Hey, you know, good luck in your future endeavors.  Right.  This picture will have half a Gary and Bladder's head in it as they follow you guys to the fucking doors.  Fucking stalkers.  Yeah.  All right, here's what's going on.  We got Jim's comedy special.  We're only a few days away now.  Three days, right?  Friday night, yeah.  American Degenerate premieres this Friday on Epix at 10 o'clock.  EpixHD.com, I think you were saying?  Or .net?  .com, if you don't have Epix yet.  Wait.  EpixHD.com.  Yeah.  Got it.  Okay. 
[00:54:30]  And Patrice O'Neill's latest album, Unrelease, is out today on iTunes.  Please go and get it.  It goes to a great cause.  Yes.  Family.  Huh?  Do you want to play something?  Yeah, let's play a track from that.  What do we got?  Anything good?  Yeah, I mean, we've got some, like, three-minute clips if you want to play one.  Let's do it.  You have a CD, right?  Oh, you want me to do it for you?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, because Eric doesn't have a copy.  Okay.  Let's do track four.  Track four from Patrice O'Neill's Unrelease.  Old Dick versus Old Pussy.  Nice.  The money's going to his mom and...  And Vaughn, yeah.  And Vaughn and probably other people, who knows. 
[00:55:00]  But here's the great and the very missed Patrice O'Neill.  Once you find that special dick, you've got to have it.  Because here's the thing about Old Dick and Old Pussy, the difference.  Old Dick.  Women don't want to teach new dick nothing.  You're not like us.  You know, if you want to be cougars and shit, and you want to go fuck a young guy, and he 
[00:55:30]  can't fuck, you're like, oh boy.  Here's the thing.  Now, there's some passion that has gone for me and my girl's relationship, meaning I just  don't have the ability anymore to look at her and get, like, oh, oh, oh, sighted.  But what I do give her is clinical orgasms, meaning this bitch can nut even if she's mad  at me.  I can, she can be like, ah, just fucking eat my pussy. 
[00:56:00]  Come on.  And she can nut because I know how to make her nut.  That's it.  And I know how to make her nut.  It's never, when she wants to nut, it's never romantic.  It's just, I, she lays on her back, two pillows, and she fucking, she pops her legs back.  I get into a comfortable, I rest my, my chin, I rest my chin on her, her cooch, on the hole,  the pussy hole, to get, like, a good base. 
[00:56:30]  She spreads her cooch open with her two index finger.  And I, I, and then I, I hold her titties and do this.  And then I just.  She goes, she grunts. 
[00:57:00]  And she, squeeze my head.  And then she says, get off of me.  And then she unsexily asked me, you, you, you come in?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And she gets into position, licks my nips, I beat off, and that's sex. 
[00:57:30]  Now, I can replace that with the passion of new pussy, but, but, men don't mind teaching women shit.  That's the thing, that's the difference between old dick, old pussy, is old men love new pussy  because we like to teach new, there's nothing better than introducing a girl to some shit dick.  That's why your strange dick was cool, because she's never, you've been with, you've seen it. 
[00:58:00]  It's just like, look at that new shit with the bag on it, baby.  Ruben's introduced new fucking, that kind of dick.  And it's just like, you'll never be surprised again, like he surprised you, you know?  The Open Entry Show will return in a moment.  After all, millionaires have to piss too. 
[00:58:30]  The Open Entry Show.  The Open Entry Show.  Oh.  I sang it better, you rock.  Wise ass.  80's on 8.  You should probably, uh... 
[00:59:00]  You know, look at the hot clock.  Get yourself a sheet with all information about the artist.  I got a bone and pick with Martha Quinn if we're talking about 80's on 8.  I'm a company guy now, so I'm listening to a lot of different channels.  Yeah.  Sampling.  Sampling.  Mm-hmm.  And consulting.  Oh.  She, uh, did some, uh, I don't know, 80's on 8 trivia thing, 80's trivia, and I guess  you can play along on the website if you want.  Oh, wow.  Maybe we could do that.  That sounds cool. 
[00:59:30]  And she actually had a pretty good question.  She, she asked, uh, what football team won the most Super Bowls in the 80's?  In the 80's.  I listened to this on the way home yesterday.  I would have to say the 49ers.  Jimmy?  I think the 49ers is correct.  Well, you're both right.  Ah.  And she gives the answer, but then she doesn't give how many they won.  Oh, Martha!  And I don't know, how many you think they won in the 80's?  But why would you have, why wouldn't you say, yeah, the answer was the 49ers and they won 
[01:00:00]  such and such amount.  Four?  Yeah, I think the fifth one was Steve Young.  See?  We don't even know.  It was four?  Okay.  Nice.  So make sure Martha Quinn knows that I have a little problem with her.  It was a good, it was a good question.  It kept me, uh, tuned in.  But then she doesn't give the, the number.  Broadway Joe Montana?  Yeah, can we play the 80's game?  And Steve Young, what, did Steve Young win in the 90's or was he in the 89?  Oh. 
[01:00:30]  What are you?  A douche.  Well, you sure don't want to say that in this room, yeah?  It's really a bad thing to say in here.  Sucks to be on guard for four hours a day.  I hate it.  As soon as I leave here, I'm not on guard anymore.  You feel like a fucking wounded zebra at a watering hole in this room.  Just constantly looking around.  My mother used to say, Chip, you're a Weisenheimer. 
[01:01:00]  What are you doing with that?  This is going great.  Okay, fuck it.  What's next?  Oh, God.  Steve Young won the 89.  89.  89.  89 season or 89 Super Bowl? 
[01:01:30]  Well, 89 Super Bowl, 88, 89 season.  That's always that thing.  Like, oh, what year was that?  Oh, no, it was all.  All right, then.  Because...  So Montana, what, won three?  Okay.  Montana won three in the 80s, and then Steve Young won the fourth.  Bradshaw won four, didn't he?  I know Aikman won three.  Damn.  Aikman won two.  And I think...  You're just playing the game all by yourself, aren't you?  Right.  Does Bradshaw...  Bradshaw won four. 
[01:02:00]  Okay.  He's the most...  The winningest one, right?  I don't think anyone else has four.  Nine, ten, thirteen, and four.  What has Brady got these days?  Two.  Just two, man.  I thought he had three.  You should have at least one more there, right?  He's straight.  Yes.  He does have three.  What about Tebow?  Tebow.  I was thinking about you on the way in today, because I made it to the Grateful Dead channel.  Oh, God.  By the way, Underground Garage could be the best fucking channel on SiriusX. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, yeah?  You like that one?  Holy fuck, I do.  Little Steven.  That's Little Steven Van Zandt.  It's got a nice little niche.  It's a lot of songs I've never heard of, but they're cool.  Yeah?  And I just like it.  Yes.  I want to give him props, man, because it's very different.  Propellers?  Underground Garage.  I was listening to...  What the fuck?  Paul Revere and the Raiders today, but it was just a cool-sounding song.  It wasn't like one of the hits?  No, I never heard the song before in my life. 
[01:03:00]  So he takes a bunch of these songs that no one ever heard and plays them?  That should be songs that you should know.  Oh, wow.  I like that type of music radio.  You know, because most program directors were closed-minded.  If it wasn't a hit out of the box, they're like, oh, fuck that.  Let it wither on the vine, as they say.  That's right.  But check out Underground Garage, if you haven't.  Little Steven's.  It's pretty fucking cool.  I like it.  But I'm like, man, Ant would hate this.  I would, right?  I listened to a 20-minute... 
[01:03:30]  This was the Grateful Dead channel.  A 20-minute version of St. Stephen.  Oh, God!  And you listened to it?  Yeah.  Well, I was half asleep, so it was perfect.  Well, good.  You get all the way asleep after listening to that.  St. Stephen.  Oh, no.  And then you don't even know it's the song anymore for about 10 minutes, and then...  It comes back.  And then it pops back into the riff.  You're like, oh, okay, I'm still listening to St. Stephen.  Oh, I hate that St. Stephen. 
[01:04:00]  And I just thought about you, how it just sounds like they're tuning their guitar the whole time.  Oh, listen to this.  I hate this.  Oh, sounds like when I go to the Ren Fair.  May I have a cup of grog, m'lady?  Only 19.  Renaissance Fair's coming up in Tuxedo, New York.  Maybe I'll go.  Cup of grog, m'lady?  You're gonna go. 
[01:04:30]  Pardon, pardon.  Could you direct me to the privy?  Oh, I'd be so embarrassed to talk like that.  I don't talk like that.  No?  No, not unless I really get a lot of grog in me.  My grog has come.  It's this weekend.  It's this weekend.  What are you doing?  You gotta get up there.  I'm sorry.  It's every weekend.  Whoa.  Until September 22nd.  Yeah, okay.  I got time.  Could the show go up there?  Oh, man.  Sure.  Should.  Let's do a little field trip. 
[01:05:00]  Where is Tuxedo?  We have a lot of fans at the Ren Fair, my friend.  Of course we do.  Yes, we do.  Every time I go, a lot of people.  Wait a minute.  Wayne says a good point.  Wait, you guys are bitching about Martha Quinn, the guys who used to go home before the number  one answer?  I forgot about that.  And by the way, I'm hearing that Travis is wrong.  There was Montana did win four, which I thought, and then Steve Young won in 94.  All right.  What's wrong with that wrestler?  Uh-oh.  I saw that, too.  What's wrong with him? 
[01:05:30]  Who is that?  That was Fox and we know.  He's going to be on Fox and Friends.  He was extremely famous.  And holy shit, he looks horrible.  He didn't look very good.  On Fox?  Yeah, yeah.  They just went to commercial.  Who was that?  You know what?  He's right.  He was Montana's backup in 89.  So, technically, he won a ring, but he didn't.  Oh.  So, Montana got the four.  Yeah.  All right.  I don't know who that wrestler was.  What's wrong with this fat thing?  I know he can't see.  Wait.  Thanks to the help of the Saudi king. 
[01:06:00]  What?  They can't move the fucking thing out of the way, so you can't see his fat fucking face.  Hey, what happened to St. Stephen?  Oh.  It was just on a build, man.  Build.  He's singing Elvis along with his cats.  That's Lex Luger.  That was Lex Luger?  He's going to be here today, I think.  He's doing something.  Really?  Who is Lex Luger?  Lex Luger?  He used to be.  He was one of the biggest names.  Yeah, he body slammed Yokozuna.  Oh, he was a wrestler.  Yeah, he was a monster, man.  He was obviously, well, I can't say obviously.  It looked like he was on the roids.  And now it looks like he's got some major fucking issues. 
[01:06:30]  No, he was with Miss Elizabeth when she died.  Oh, yeah?  They think rumor is that he may have contributed to it, but it was never proven.  In what way?  It was funny that he was supplying her with her shit.  Oh, no.  He had a spinal stroke.  A what?  A spinal stroke.  Ah, hell is that?  In 2007, six years ago, he suffered a nerve impingement in his neck that led to temporary  paralysis.  Right.  June 2008, he was able to stand on his own for short periods of time and use a walker. 
[01:07:00]  In 2010, he said he's able to walk more comfortably and able to drive around.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, he's not doing well at all.  Yeah.  Turn this up, man.  This is starting to sing.  Horrible music.  For hours.  It was 20 minutes.  20 minutes of this shit.  I drive an hour and a half.  So this was like. 
[01:07:30]  Who is this open?  This is the Grateful Dead.  Woof.  You don't like?  No.  That's like David Lee Ross.  That's what he looks like these days?  Lex Luger?  He was a wrestling monster, man.  When's he here?  This afternoon.  Oh.  Oh, God.  This stinks.  It's terrible.  How did you listen to this?  I was just digging it.  Just going with it, man.  No, you don't go with it. 
[01:08:00]  I know what you mean, but you don't with this.  Don't go with it, man.  Especially when you're driving at a high speed.  Yeah, I was going 80 fucking five miles an hour.  Listen to this.  How did you get mellow?  It didn't really fucking match up.  You're right.  If you're stoned, this might be great at the show.  And you're like on fucking hallucinogenics.  Oh, I'd be so angry I was there.  Some girl with a fucking nice hairy pits and dirty bare feet and bunions.  Exactly.  And I also listened to Ray Charles' Busted.  You ever hear that song?  No. 
[01:08:30]  That's a cool little fucking song.  Yeah?  That was on the 50s channel.  50s?  Boy.  I've been told to be more of a company, guys.  You are sampling.  Is this Busted?  Yeah.  I fucking love this dumb thing today.  Another song I've never heard before in my life.  My bills are all due and the baby needs you.  Of course.  Of course.  Yeah, yeah.  Cotton it down to a quarter of a pound, but I'm busted. 
[01:09:00]  I got caught tugging my pecker.  My mother said, Busted!  Good one, Chip.  The town is gonna hold my belongings away, cause I'm busted.  Oh, what happened?  You don't like this amp?  No.  Why?  This is awful.  Why is it awful? 
[01:09:30]  It's just the same shit.  And damn it.  I'm in the face like a dog without a phone, but I'm busted.  And damn it, damn it, damn it.  My brother said there ain't a thing I can do.  My wife and my kids are all down with the blue.  This is the beginning of a movie.  Is it?  It always sounds like it.  It's just, yeah.  I'm holding on you and I'm busted.  What movie?  No, it just sounds like it would be the beginning of a movie.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, it's so...  Well, I am no thief, but a man can go wrong when he's busted. 
[01:10:00]  I hear ya.  The food that we can to last summer is gone.  I'm busted.  This is good, man.  I like this.  The fields are all there and the cotton won't grow.  Me and my family got to pack up and go.  But I'll make a living just where I don't know.  Cause I'm busted.  I'm broke. 
[01:10:30]  Uh-huh.  No bread.  I'm not feeling it.  I mean like nothing.  Yeah.  And that just kind of fades out.  I like that.  I liked it, man.  Yeah.  Why don't you torture yourself?  Oh, and this song's still on?  Still going.  This is...  St. Steve is so fucking horrible.  How long is this version?  You've still got another six minutes.  Another six minutes. 
[01:11:00]  Was it really playing the whole time or you're doing a bit?  No, no.  That's why it faded up so easily.  Who's singing with him?  I don't know who the female singer is.  I have no idea.  I don't go that deep in the dead.  Like what year is this particular recording?  The one I heard this morning was from 1977, Hartford, Connecticut.  80 different versions.  And then I was listening to Aerosmith, Let the Music Do the Talking.  Yeah.  But he fucking sings the whole fucking time.  Wouldn't you just let the music do the talking?  Oh, well.  I'm like, that don't make no sense. 
[01:11:30]  That don't make no sense.  Why would you sing Let the Music Do the Talking?  Just let the music do the talking.  This is okay.  This was one of the popular ones on Underground Garage.  Yeah?  This one I knew.  I didn't know a lot of the songs on Underground Garage.  Oh, this is in the dead?  Aerosmith.  Man. 
[01:12:00]  You like the Aerosmith?  Train kept it rolling all night long.  Nothing.  There's a few that I can deal with.  Sweet Emotion?  What do you got?  Anything?  Toys in the Attic?  Not really.  You don't like them?  I gotta be honest.  Wait, you think they're overrated?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Your music taste is tough, man.  It really is.  I know I'm terrible.  You don't expand.  You don't expand out too far. 
[01:12:30]  No.  How do you not like Aerosmith?  For real.  I don't know.  Like this to me is...  You don't like that down and dirty.  Generic fucking...  You don't like that down and dirty shit.  It should be in a race car video game.  Oh.  Yeah, this is like a Tony Hawk.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  I'm not feeling this.  Holy fuck.  He did body slam him. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, I'm watching this video.  Holy shit.  I think everyone except Lex Luger is dead, right?  Yeah.  Crush is dead.  Crush is dead.  Yokozuna is dead.  Yokozuna is dead.  Macho Man is dead.  Elizabeth's dead.  Elizabeth's dead.  Wow.  Lex Luger is almost dead.  Yeah.  What year was this?  93-ish?  Somewhere in there, yeah.  Because this led to the Lex Express.  This was so 90s.  Where he had a bus and just went around America.  Bobby the Brain Heenan.  Before he lost half his face.  Right?  Yeah.  Is he dead? 
[01:13:30]  No.  He might as well be.  He should be.  What's going on with this Saudi man that weighs 1,300 pounds?  What is that about?  The king is offering to help him lose weight.  Probably by removing his head.  The king.  Where was this?  The Intrepid?  Oh, it's still on it.  Oh, come on.  You can't see it because they have the fucking sign in front of his face.  They put the fucking graphic up and they...  Is it really still on?  Now you're...  Yeah, three minutes.  Now you're doing a bit.  No.  Oh my god.  You're under three minutes. 
[01:14:00]  It's like we never left.  Oh, this horrible...  If people...  If you were at a concert listening to this and you liked it, you're a fucking asshole.  The whole place was into it.  I probably made about five Dead Shows.  How annoying would it be?  Probably about.  I'd be like, this is taking up time that you play hits. 
[01:14:30]  Do you like fish?  I never got into fish.  Now I'm out.  Stupid fish.  I tried to.  Never really got into that.  There was no Barney Miller.  Oh, whoa.  I yelled at Stinky once for...  Wasn't it Stinky?  Like called up.  I hotlined Stinky when we were on vacation at NEW.  And what?  He was just doing the show?  Yeah, he was doing the show and he played fish.  How was he just doing the show?  Why did we allow that?  I don't know.  Because he used to play like eight minutes of music.  Hold on.  What a story you've got.  Yes. 
[01:15:00]  We'll go back to fish.  It's quite the story.  You were at absolutely the top of the wrestling world, but behind the scenes we had no idea  that personal hell you had fallen into.  Yeah, it's sort of a good lesson for young people, hopefully, that read the book, that  we read what we sow.  It's kind of a universal principle.  And everything seemed like everything was going wonderful behind the scenes.  I was making a lot of poor choices and bad decisions.  We should have got a bunch of them.  Who I was hanging with and what I was doing.  And it all unraveled at a certain point.  What were some of those things you were doing and what did you lose because of it? 
[01:15:30]  Drugs, alcohol, women.  I lost my family.  I had a beautiful wife and two kids.  One guy corrected me one time when I was speaking.  He said, you didn't lose them.  You gave them up.  For other stuff.  Chasing.  My friends called you.  You were chasing the life of folly, Lex.  That's what I was chasing the life of folly.  Well, in a way, you got a lot of unbelievable shape.  So you're playing to packed arenas.  So you had all the trappings of fame and fortune.  What was the allure that you were prepared for?  People should have Bob Backlund.  Jimmy's favorite wrestler.  Well, I think with anybody, I'd go home and play the good father and husband back in Atlanta 
[01:16:00]  where I lived.  And then I'd get down the road.  And I guess I didn't have any accountability because there's always temptation out there.  I didn't have the accountability in my life to somebody or something.  For me now, it's God.  But I mean, to really sit me down and go, what are you doing?  That I felt that I had to answer to.  Well, it caught up with you because you wound up spending four months in jail.  But the good news is you met somebody who changed your life.  I did.  I met a chaplain in jail. 
[01:16:30]  And I stubbornly.  I didn't make an decision to change my life at that point.  But he pursued me outside of jail.  Pastor Steve Baskin.  Very special friend.  And then he didn't try to share religion with me because I didn't grow up with religion at all.  So he just became my friend and ended up eventually sharing the good news with me.  And I made the point.  My life was supernaturally changed.  Yeah.  And you say that you're really trying to repair all those relationships that you lost.  Good luck.  That ego that you mentioned, too, that was just this wild, huge ego. 
[01:17:00]  I hope to watch her taking a dump onto a mirror.  So how can people manage that in their own lives, whether it's financial success or fame or what have you?  Balance.  I call it the sand versus the rock.  What are you building the foundation of your life on?  Is it you have faith in God?  You have, you know, love your family and your friends.  And for me, stop chasing a life of folly.  Yes.  That's what you're doing, Anthony.  Chasing a life of folly.  And I was folly.  I sat the wrong way in an airplane for a long period of time. 
[01:17:30]  My head turned.  And just due to my, long story short, neurologist said because of all my muscle I still had then and all my injuries, normal from football and wrestling career, bone spursing, I cut the blood flow off to my central cord.  I woke up this morning paralyzed in a hotel room.  Thought I was dehydrated.  Being the athlete, I must not be, I must be dehydrated.  I must have reached total muscle.  I need some water.  Yeah.  And it wasn't, no, I need a lot more than water.  Turn your teeth, move your head.  I went to Shepherd Center in Atlanta, which is an incredible rehab center. 
[01:18:00]  They're wonderful.  And they gave me a zero to five percent chance of any movement from the neck down.  So what I can do now today is incredible.  I'm very thankful.  Paralyzed.  Well, it's great to hear your story.  Thank you.  How you come back, where you've been, and where you're heading.  Lex Luger, thank you very much for coming.  Oh, thanks.  And congratulations on your book.  Go get it.  Wrestling with the Devil.  Wrestling with the Devil.  Wrestling with the Devil.  Okay, brother.  Oh, my God.  How does Wrestling with the Devil go, Chip?  You got a little bit of that?  If you could instantly write a song, what would it sound like? 
[01:18:30]  Wrestling with the Devil.  Of course it sounds like that.  The lyrics just write themselves.  Oh, they really do.  Regular John Lennon.  St. Stephen's still playing.  Oh, better not be.  No, I ran out.  No, I ran out.  Thank God.  That's too bad.  We could restart it.  No.  Why?  Because the dead is terrible.  What a niche band. 
[01:19:00]  Boy, did they get lucky coming up with a bunch of fucking zombie-like followers.  God.  I like that they didn't mind their shows being taped.  I really like that they embraced that.  They did different shows every night.  Yeah, because it didn't matter.  At a time when no one was embracing that shit.  It's like, oh, we're just jamming anyway.  Who gives a shit?  No one's going to want to hear it.  What?  That's fucking...  What?  Didn't you get to trade your cassettes, man?  People did that, right?  You wouldn't trade your cassettes?  What do you think a real dead fan has? 
[01:19:30]  How many shows?  Oh, God.  A crazy dead fan.  Hundreds.  Easily.  Really?  Oh, God.  They'd trade them all over the place.  So many dead shows.  You would go to the parking lot and people would just be like,  Hey, man, I got San Francisco 74.  I'll cook you some spaghetti for fucking the palladium and fucking...  Fuck that.  Two dollars a plate.  Disgusting.  I ate many a plate of spaghetti in the parking lot.  It was delicious.  Some filthy asshole making it.  But when do you listen to them? 
[01:20:00]  If you're at a dead show for three and a half hours...  Right.  What, do you listen to another show on the way home?  No.  Right, we get it.  You like them.  On the way home?  What is that?  Oh, you're right.  If the fans didn't go home, they would pack up and go to the next place.  And on the way, they would listen to dead shows.  What years did they tour Big Big?  Like from...  I see now...  Like 68?  Or were they earlier than that?  Wow.  Someone has got to help me out here.  I would...  They...  When they were like just selling out arenas? 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, just where people were following them all over.  I would have to just go low 70s, obviously, right?  I'm following the dead this summer.  Shut up!  But follow a job!  I would have followed the dead.  I would have followed.  Yeah?  Yeah, just to see America and shit.  The parking lot was amazing at a dead show.  You're not seeing America.  You're seeing the fucking dregs of society.  And then they're like...  I listen to a lot of people in the parking lot.  They'd be like, yeah, man, we're not going to Chicago, but we'll meet you in Des Moines. 
[01:21:00]  They'd blow off one of the stops and go to the next one to get a good spot in the parking lot.  What is that?  Oh, fuck, dude.  It was a traveling circus.  What the fuck?  The entire summer.  That's all it was.  People going from one show to the other.  And a lot of times they didn't even go to the concert.  They just went to the parking lot.  Do you think people sometimes missed the show because they were too high in the parking lot?  Oh, well...  I was right at answering that.  I don't know.  I mean, I literally...  Here you go.  Now you've got to talk to a dead head.  All right. 
[01:21:30]  Dave in Connecticut.  Dave?  Of course.  Hey, how's it going today, boys?  Hey, Dave.  What's up, buddy?  How old are you, Dave?  I am in my late 40s.  Late 40s.  Okay.  Yeah, and I went to several hundred dead shows back in the day.  Several hundred?  That's a lot.  So that means you were traveling with them.  On a break from college and, you know, even when I was working, we'd take a couple weeks  off.  We would travel around. 
[01:22:00]  So I'm mainly on the East Coast, but a few times we went cross-country.  Why, sir?  The music and the whole theme was awesome.  When you were that age, young and single, a bunch of your friends, road sodas, in the  car, uh...  I could do it without that fucking...  I don't mind all that other stuff without that fucking droning, redundant, repetitive  fucking soundtrack that's playing in the background of your drinking and partying. 
[01:22:30]  Wait, we need a song for this break.  What song do you want to hear, Dave?  Touch of Grey is one the dead fans love.  What do you want to hear?  We want to play Bertha.  We'll get a little rocking over here.  What's it called?  Bertha.  B-E-R-T-H-A.  Bertha.  I've never heard that.  Bertha's a great song.  Bertha?  You don't know Bertha?  No!  You should know Bertha.  Give us a little Bertha. 
[01:23:00]  Bertha.  This one I know.  All right, continue, Dave.  Of course.  This one.  Well, sure.  Sounds like fucking Allman Brothers right there.  I love the Allman Brothers.  You don't even like the Allman Brothers, do you?  No.  You like the Allman Brothers better than...  I like the short Allman Brothers songs.  oh listen to this what it's this again he's not hurting anyone no he's hurting me why i hate

[01:25:00]  they were all stone so bertha is actually about a fan that's funny and he sings about for 14 14  fucking minutes a fan that would move around the room because it was on high but if you're  fucking tripping that that must have been pretty cool to see yeah all right dave i'm with you brother  i'll bet you that was their code word like what were you doing last night chasing bertha yeah

[01:40:00]  this really fucking sucks because they don't they want to look cool in front of everybody  thinking that they really like this shit and and then you you paid to listen to these musicians  yeah but you'd fuck around and noodle it's different every time you're watching a practice yeah  what about that can you know what no one is enjoying this so if you're at madison square  garden new year's eve you're sitting there watching this they're doing this right here

[01:46:00]  fucking mean that is me a pig in a blanket i apologize iraq how's the movie coming it's doing  all right all right oh good good to hear what decade you up to or you're writing it all at once  uh i stopped writing for a while oh damn i'll take it back i hope you're on a writer's block we  gotta talk to a girl that goes to fish shows oh cool yes we do amy  hello what's up amy how are you talking about fish today we're noticing in this crowd shot of 
[01:46:30]  this one particular show there's not a lot of uh women in the crowd um yeah there are quite a few  girls that go to fish shows i mean there's definitely more guys but there are definitely  quite a few girls that go yeah i'm not singing them interesting and what do you like about uh fish  fish um i know that you guys absolutely hate the music that they're playing correct sound so oh yay hippie  but i really i like the music but i will agree with you when they start jamming you're just like 
[01:47:00]  oh fuck stop it's been 20 minutes oh my god see you're right yes there are people who like when i  go to a show i i enjoy it i love it but it's just like okay be done with this song and move on to the  next one so yeah it gets a little annoying and do you get uh do you get high not anymore oh would you  used to take like acid um no not acid i mean mushrooms pills i've i've been there sober also 
[01:47:30]  and i enjoy it actually a little bit more because you know you know falling over and as far as people  bumping into you absolutely people bump into you the whole time they're we're looking at some video  of people just you know grooving grooving but it's now it's it's a crowd level it's like in the crowd  and man this looks like a group of people i want nothing to do with i mean really probably be true 
[01:48:00]  yeah that would probably be true a lot of people who don't smell so good yeah a lot of peasant dresses  and fucking girls like fucking and and people blowing bubbles and fucking yeah doing that doing  that i have wings and i'm flying dance oh god that you need to watch out for the ones that spin around  just there are people i've watched at shows who have just spun in circles for 30 45 minutes oh nice 
[01:48:30]  and i don't and i go to shows and i don't get that it's just yeah it's there are definitely some  strange cats at some shows but there are also some you know quote normal people that go i mean i i  like to consider myself not a spinner with wings on it it's kind of normal like i have a normal life  i work full-time i have kids so oh all right well you used to be a little crazier it sounds like  a little bit back in the day but you got to grow up and i think that's it 
[01:49:00]  no no you don't seven and a half minutes all right thank you amy thank you amy fish fan one more  aaron in atlanta aaron this is like the funniest shit i've heard in weeks you guys this is fucking  great uh i'm with anthony on this one i think this is just a bunch of fucking garbage this is crap  it's crap it's fucking hilarious it's  it's dribble like to use one of jimmy's words it's just dribble you can't yeah i you i agree you 
[01:49:30]  can't enjoy this with tournaments the same no boring fucking  oh they're they're having a blast they're just fucking playing their instrument it's just a time  to them just is going by like fucking crazy it's a different headspace though oh it's no it's no  headspace you understand what you're getting into when i was in college when i was in college there  was these the group of uh fish fans i went to school a little little school in north georgia 
[01:50:00]  and there was this little clique of fish fans they would uh they would write with poster paint on their  on the backs of their fucking hippie cars about how many days until the fish concert three days till  fish man and you gotta listen to that shit two days till fish man oh and it's horny and you sat  next to them in the computer lab fucking forget it that's all they're talking about right oh all  they're talking about the smell jesus christ uh oh just fucking terrible oh and the one band that 
[01:50:30]  nobody's mentioned yet is uh they're based out of atlanta widespread panic oh god i remember  widespread panic yeah oh yeah another one of those bullshit jam bands what was their big song  they had one song no it's like it's all 30 minute version no we had to play one of those  fucking songs what was it i don't know i've heard of the name i've never all right aaron thank you so  much brother thanks boys goodbye now what's widespread panic's big song widespread panic out of atlanta huh 
[01:51:00]  yeah they had one song i think another jam band i think they i'm gonna speak out of turn i'm not  sure i i thought they were one of those bands that just kind of progressed into a jam band yeah are  they one of those i'm not sure could you imagine this now they're bringing it back oh yeah  still more just lead anyone know the widespread panic was it uh hope in a hopeless world oh god i don't 
[01:51:30]  know can't get high no those are both 95 and 97. let's play one i don't know anything they do this  this is absolutely terrible it's it's unfuriating you don't like this one no this stinks should we  try a different one yeah we got another 25 minutes you can't make your opinion oh i'm one 25 minute  song no there's a guy on twitter uh nick nick's hex on twitter he writes uh i fucking uh oh wait 
[01:52:00]  that's not the guy oh no it might have been the guy you uh inadvertently credited someone else no  i think he also had another tweet now i'm trying to find the other two yeah whatever basically said  i think it was his sister-in-law uh followed fish around all summer with with her one-year-old oh  that's a good thing to do was that the guy that said that somewhere ah whatever yeah one-year-old  on tour with a fucking oh here it is yeah it was the same guy my sister oh it's his sister my  sister followed fish one summer with my one-year-old nephew in tow we almost disowned her 
[01:52:30]  does this song sound familiar yeah it was widespread panic right i thought they had a hit  driving song i've heard of that before is that the one i don't know but i've heard of that  baby born in new york city this sounds um very early 70s 
[01:53:00]  i think they're more of a uh band and then you know like a jam band that's why i think i think  they started moving into that jam world a little bit i'm not positive i'm hearing some fucking verses  of a song that's kind of refreshing i'm hearing structure and i want to hear if a chorus actually  comes up after this verse it would be nice all right uh best part of about fish they're ben and  jerry's ice cream you don't have a ben and jerry's ice cream named after you it's good no i don't fish 
[01:53:30]  does hey look a chorus fish food right that's great there's a chorus  after that fucking i don't i don't like this but after fucking listening to 25 minutes of fish  this is fucking led zeppelin i don't mind this i i think they're they're compared to a lot of you  know like classic rock so they probably get lumped in with that yeah stuff yeah  now oh what is this uh fish is still going oh oh cool how many minutes now listen get about two 
[01:54:00]  and a half now they've turned into some fucking this is spinal taps jazz odyssey  jazz odyssey  well we've got two songs we can do what you know that idea we've been thinking about doing jazz odyssey  and there's fucking three people in the bleachers doing ones doing the thumbs down to the band  our bass player wrote this 
[01:54:30]  should we break yeah this fucking travis goes yeah this fucking cd everyone here has to pee  okay yeah why don't we um you want to play something else from patrice o'neal's yeah cd i  gotta shake the dew off my lily what does that mean chip yes oh all right you can track seven seven  okay threesomes a couple things this is jim norton's week man he's got his big comedy special this  friday on epics at 10 o'clock please watch epics hd.com if you don't get epics american degenerate 
[01:55:00]  from jim norton premieres this friday with an amazing uh an amazing opening to the uh special  as well and then patrice o'neal our old uh pal there he's got an album out called unreleased  it's gonna help his uh mama it's on ivan yep and other people that he left behind so uh it's on  itunes now please go and get that and we're gonna play another track from unreleased by patrice o'neal  you said seven all right let's play this it's uh called threesomes you got a man now 
[01:55:30]  everything good or you lying which one of y'all single this one's single she snitched on you  you single too where's your man you don't even know he is this is some unhappy going on  i'm trying to start a revolution i'm trying to get like threesomes man to be  and i don't even mean threesomes i should say multiple 
[01:56:00]  like i want another woman in my life and i think financially i can handle  two girlfriends and then a side hoe to them too  because i believe that i have love in my heart enough because i love my woman 
[01:56:30]  but i think i love her as much as i can but i still have more love to give  so what am i going to do with that excess love  but it's up to you  ladies it's not up to me it's up to you to accept that because look there's a lot of women that don't 
[01:57:00]  have a man and you have to understand something about men if you meet a guy and he says he's  available and doesn't have a woman he he's lying  he might have seven  because we don't get you  by standing there just being sexy and waiting for you to buy me a drink  i have to go get you i have to get you 
[01:57:30]  so if i have to get you in between waiting till something gonna happen with you i gotta go and  get another one  in between time and then i start weighing the good and the bad of the seven  but if i meet you and i say to you i have a wife  you should be happy because you're like okay good i'm only competing  but women are insane because you think because you the one that you you're special 
[01:58:00]  but you look at relationships are only as special they're as special as a car accident  when you're driving up the street here i could have been driving up the street like you if you  collide i could have stopped at this red light and you would have missed me 
[01:58:30]  but the fate made us smash into each other but it ain't like i'm looking for a car accident you  understand what i'm saying car accidents just happen so i go hey how you doing you go hey how  you doing car accident  you weren't my dream girl i didn't dream about you i just bumped into you  and the same i say to every other woman worked 
[01:59:00]  really worked on you  this is the opian anthony this is the opian anthony show  the opian anthony show  sleep me on monday morning 
[01:59:30]  it's tuesday  that's why we're sleeping  i reference this this morning mashup yeah  sleep me on monday morning  morning morning  see they're just cracking themselves oh man  just having a good time with each other that's a good thing to have  a good time do those guys ever fight i don't get it i don't know they go to a radio show with 
[02:00:00]  somebody there's got to be some fighting that goes on man they are constantly you see them walk  down the hall together and everything i don't get it they seem like they never have an issue with  each other they get along very very well that's because they talk like uh what three minutes an hour  well yesterday they were they were terrific oh yeah yeah they really were terrific they were talking  about things that uh are going away a little phone break denny would appreciate that oh he probably 
[02:00:30]  a little phone topic he probably would although he's a more music guy but oh my god what happened  that chick well she's the one that got she's the one that got attacked by the bear what 12 year  old girl mauled by a black bear in your home oh another i can't tell which one was mauled by the  bear yeah which one which one was mauled by the bear the girl on the right what's wrong what part of  her body she's all bruised up in the top by her eye oh yeah off from my house and from my house or 
[02:01:00]  my house in my cabin that i couldn't run that fast that far but um it was just very terrifying very  scary of course it was and not only did the bear catch up to you and attack you once the bears  went away a little bit and then you tried to run again and it attacked you uh do you remember  feeling anything or thinking the bear goes away sometimes the bear don't go away you remember  thinking anything of course yeah oh my god i'm gonna be eaten alive yeah i'm not gonna survive this this is 
[02:01:30]  this bear is gonna kill me this is this is it i'm a goner and where is she from she sounds weird  really feel it grand rapids michigan my whole body was numb and it it just really hurt and i was  reading that at one point that you even tried petting the bear maybe how did that work out for  you yeah i the second time it kind of stopped by me and i was like good bear please don't hurt me 
[02:02:00]  but that didn't work elizabeth i mean your daughter really takes this entire experience in stride but i  mean she needed a hundred stitches and had suffered some very deep cuts in her thighs as well as in her  back what were you what do you make of this entire experience obviously first and foremost just relieved  that she's okay oh absolutely it's what was that you you never want your children to hurt and you  want to never want to protect them and keep them safe um you know this is a run that she would do every  single day and in a place that she's familiar with and uh and for her to get hurt out there like that 
[02:02:30]  that um it was absolutely the scariest thing i've ever experienced in my life absolutely  that's for sure and abby you played her the thing that seemed to kind of save you in the end was you  ended up that's an interview that should have been two minutes and this right right just stretching i  mean we've been guilty of that ourselves well of course well yeah wouldn't you just when you just jerk  off the bear you think that would work just grab it and start cranking suck its dick a bear you're 
[02:03:00]  getting mauled by a bear what's your move wouldn't you just try to jerk it off you know but just you  know turns on another part of its brain that's a brilliant idea well what would you do i'm not  sure i probably wouldn't even think of that though i'd probably you know the fighting well she tried  petting yeah petting the bear but she should have didn't work gave his putt a tug yeah give a little  bear putt a tug see if it distracts him what would you do well i would shoot it but well 
[02:03:30]  can't run up in a tree because they fucking climb trees yeah but as they're climbing a tree though you  can fucking stomp on kick down on his face yeah maybe but he'd probably grab your foot and pull you  right out of there with his mouth bears uh can you outrun a bear uh no why not no they will  fucking pounce on you know what you got to do when you're running away yeah as you're running you got  to point down the finger oh look honey does that work yeah he goes right down the street 
[02:04:00]  yeah you're supposed to put your arms up in the air like you're at a fish show  yeah yeah you're supposed to groove with the bear yeah if you do a little groove he falls asleep  exactly there's the magic yes  yeah that's why you hear the magic of opiate anthony  you're supposed to like uh make a loud noise to scare him away put your arms up like this yeah so  it makes yourself bigger than right bigger than you are and try to scare him could you look up jerking 
[02:04:30]  off a bear i i think that's got to be a guarantee you guys are going to come up with fucking uh just  hairy men yes oh you know what yeah that's what it's gonna be yes yeah no like uh oh no it's it's  a bear jerking off see bears playing with his pud he understands i wish i had a human that could do  this oh man i think i think you got to try to jerk him off tickle those balls a little bit as he's 
[02:05:00]  mauling you he doesn't really know what he's doing no yeah show him the way wouldn't you be more apt to  try to rip the balls off maybe get him that way that would get him angry man even more angry he's  already with you that thing looks kind of human that's creepy that is creepy bears are awesome  bears are not awesome i'm not a big fan of the bear oh here's a you wanna here's here's here's a great  idea oh there's problems with this guy's idea but let's go to keegan in uh new york keegan 
[02:05:30]  hey what's up hey you're not keegan bradley are you no no no no no not at all yeah i know  of course uh the idea that i always heard was uh because bears have uh such stubby front arms  yeah that would take a run down a hill but you got to find the hill  granted granted but if there's like everything else i uh if you have a gun like anthony that 
[02:06:00]  probably going to shoot the bear in the face i guess yeah i remember when i was years ago working  in in uh way upstate new york there was a canadian comedian and i don't know his name but he was a  little he had a funny line about he goes they say bears don't run well down hills neither do i  i wish i remember that guy's name run downhill because the bears got stubby like how many people  flop and start falling down a hill when they run down i fell down a hill once i got berries all over  my goddamn shorts yeah chipper good old chip my mother's like chipper you got juniper berries on your 
[02:06:30]  shorts now i would say the best way is shoot him in the head or you got to play dead yeah so they  say or just tell him you're dead yeah throw those arms up in the air like you just don't scare him  like ah but if he comes after you you're supposed to like getting a ball on the ground and and cover  the back of your neck 
[02:07:00]  a ball just have a ball but maybe if you misunderstood that  and you miss you misheard somebody you said play house so the bear's charging at you and  you try setting a table oh honey you're home anymore see if that would work that wouldn't  uh let's say hi to doug in north carolina oh i will not be going to north carolina this summer  i'm kind of bummed good morning no outer banks for me and of course there's no  fucking hurricanes coming right now that's right it's too damn pretty 
[02:07:30]  i saw a video the other day on youtube it was a guy in a deer stand and he was  filming bears on the ground oh i think we saw this one with like a gopro camera  you hear the bear like three times and it's in his face  we have the internet saw it saw it saw it it's a month ago it's a month ago yeah what happens what  happened he got he got all mad at us i'm thinking you gotta jerk off the bear snowy 
[02:08:00]  in michigan says there could be a problem with doing that let's uh find out snowy  yeah how you guys doing hey man um i'm not so sure getting the bear aroused is a good idea then you're  getting then you're in the news for getting fucked at this by a bear oh man right yeah you gotta  fucking how do you what's the end game which you're gonna take a bear would you take a bear  cock knowing that that you would survive but but then the whole town knows what you did to survive 
[02:08:30]  you got fucked by the bear that's a good question right yeah it would be in the town paper in the  town oh the police blotter you have claw marks on each shoulder and fucking bear jizz is really hard  to get out you have to vacuum clean your asshole for a week because that seed clings to you like  fucking little sucker and you're scarred by those bear claws so it's just it's always with you whenever  you wear a tank top everybody sees the mark of shame because oh that's right that's the guy that allowed  a bear to fuck them yeah and there's a bear nose mark in the back of your neck so you know he was 
[02:09:00]  really balls deep has he nuzzled you held your shoulders and nuzzled you as he came  maybe more embarrassing than getting your nose is flattened and has pine cone marks in it because  he fell asleep on you and your face has crashed into the floor of the forest just all these indications  that a bear had fucked you yeah but then he dozed off and you're too scared to wake him so you had  to wait until he pulled his soft dick out of you fucking eight hours later he woke up to go get 
[02:09:30]  an apple he crawled away but you survive yeah but you gotta you know let's walk around town now we're  gonna go all the way up to alaska we don't hear from alaska often uh don don let's call it no anyway  um all right you're are you really calling from alaska yeah that's serious my beach neighbor 
[02:10:00]  just came from uh that's not nice you could be a good person  from florida no he was just he was just fishing up in alaska brought home 45 pounds of salmon  oh yeah it's all over the fucking place i'm the guy that called in about the beaver bacon  uh 45 pounds of salmon and he still has who else yeah salmon uh no as far as the bear the whole bear  thing here's are you an expert sir i would say definitely we've had we've got bears all around 
[02:10:30]  our camp uh what part of alaska you're calling from sir uh we're dead center between anchorage and  fairbanks off the denali highway oh the fuck is that just sounds cold it's in the middle of  of fucking nowhere is your only radio we get is is y'all because it's on uh satellite who's y'all  we got fans up there uh yeah at least one oh you haven't run into any other ones  that's what i was getting at i was kind of hoping yeah maybe you get together on tuesday discuss the 
[02:11:00]  show yeah there you go um no as far as bears i mean it honestly depending on what time of year it is  and the food supply it doesn't matter a fuck what you do whether you stand up brave your hands in  the air make a lot of noise if he's hungry he's gonna fucking eat your ass oh man it doesn't and  and you know there's a running joke up here and i know you're gonna get on my ass but you know  everybody carries a 45 up here but it doesn't matter though the first thing they tell you is file 
[02:11:30]  off the front sight because at least then it's not gonna hurt near as bad when bear shoves it up your  ass i don't think bear's gonna shove it up your ass there we go um no but i mean you there's only  like a few places where you can shoot they've got a real thick skull so i mean in a panic the only  thing and anthony you would know you know when you're trying to aim you get your adrenaline you  know rushing and everything else you're trying to aim for his eyes or his nose because that's what's 
[02:12:00]  going to hurt you're not going to get a side shot so you just pretty much fucked wait a minute this  hold on a bear is going to survive a shot to the head god damn right it will it's it's like an inch  inch and a half thick skull it's fucking what if it's a desert eagle yeah okay it doesn't matter if  it's a desert hawk it's not going to fucking matter a 50 a 50 cal would go right through his  fucking head right to his stomach wouldn't it yeah it would but it would sit there and and it's still

[02:14:30]  and zip on down the road that's also helpful  yeah well the best thing to do is to grab one of its cubs and hold it up and say now back or i'll  hurt it yeah and shake the cup by his little leg so he starts screaming yes the moms love hearing  their cubs scream and then you throw it but in front of you so the bear has to go around you to get  the cub yeah or you put it in your underpants and make the bear find it  you know how mad a bear would be if you grabbed its cub by the back leg and swung it 
[02:15:00]  and then shoved it in your underpants and ran yeah and ran sideways laughing because you're high  oh would that bear be angry because you wouldn't understand the concept of putting it down your  underpants you think you were eating it somehow yeah yeah you guys uh went on vacation you were  talking about driving there is one up in orange county in uh fair oaks new york oh fascinating  right it's it's not it's nothing fancy but uh i just figured i'd throw it out there in case you

[03:13:30]  spin it one of a couple of ways  maybe you could  you could  you could you know  sit them down  and say look  and then say  you know  daddy is sick and tired  of having to get a babysitter  every time he wants  to spill a load  so I'm moving the hole in guys  if you want to be honest  if you think that might be  a little too harsh  maybe you could spin it  like good news  you know  whatever her name is  you guys are gonna be  seeing a lot more of her  because you know  she likes being around you 
[03:14:00]  so much she wants to move in  or just make something up  like that she's on the run  or she's been selling drugs  and she's being thrown  out of her apartment  or she's being evicted  for consorting with a negro  and she has to find  a new place to live  but make it look like  it's a fun thing  they're old enough to understand  you think  look man  I mean  maybe not  you know  they obviously are very loyal  to their mother  I would guess  but what you know  what are you supposed to do  not you know  not move on with your life  yeah true  true  but you know  Dr. Laura says 
[03:14:30]  no dating until you're 18  she doesn't  Dr. Laura  Dr. Laura tells bad nigger jokes too  which we don't do  wait did Dr. Laura really say  that you shouldn't date  until your kids are 18  yeah  no dating whatsoever  oh fuck Dr. Laura  oh fuck her  and her stupid advice  go on take  be your  be your  be your kid's dad  go take on the day  ah shut up  show your hairy pussy  to someone with a camera  that's not realistic  that's not realistic  one other quick question  my son's 13  can't take his eyes off 
[03:15:00]  her boobs  how do I deal with that  I'll let him look dude  it's normal  at least you know  be happy that he's not  looking at your  you know  at your buddy's crotch  you know  that's normal for a kid  to look at a pair of tits  you know  as long as he doesn't  do anything disrespectful  nah he's a good kid  Jimmy when are you going  to get a show  five days a week  you know you can pull it off  I don't want five days  a week dude  I'm too lazy  I'm just doing an extra day  today to make up for  what I'm going to miss  next week for vacation  but good luck buddy  let me know how it works out  alright buddy  take care  take care buddy  um  let's see 
[03:15:30]  Jeremy in Nevada  I want to talk about  Dana White and the UFC  going to Germany  yes  hi Jimmy  how's it going  good buddy  how are you  good uh  so you guys  talked to him  about that doctor  he went to in Germany  yeah  and uh  it's something that  I know could help me out  and I didn't know  if there was a way  for you guys to get  my information to him  and see if he can  run to contact me  um  I don't  I don't  I mean I guess we could  but I don't know  if Dana would  just reach out  because he doesn't know you  I mean it's uh 
[03:16:00]  no I get that  uh  or if there's a way  to get like  the name of the doctor  to me  I could go from there  well dude  I don't  did we say it on  did he say it on the air  or no  it's in Dusseldorf  it's in Dusseldorf  but it's a referral service  you can't just go  to this doctor  you have to have a referral  from somebody  that's also been  to that doctor  yeah see if you  did you try googling  Dana White doctor  Germany  uh no I'll try that  yeah and the only  the only reason  I don't want to  promise you  like yeah we'll  put you in touch  with him  because literally  I don't know  if he'd call you  back or not  you could leave  your information 
[03:16:30]  with Sal  uh whoever's  working the thing  but I can't  promise you anything  because Dana's  really really busy  dude and he's got  Rogan going over  so I don't know  how many recommendations  you're allowed  honestly  no yeah I understand  and I know  it's like a 5% chance  of him contacting me  so if it doesn't  happen it's no  worries so  alright Jeremy  we'll leave your  information with  whoever's behind  the thing there  and all we can do  is promise to  send it on  what happens  with it I don't  know but I would  suggest googling it  ok  alright thanks buddy  bye  there's a bunch of  stories where Dana's 
[03:17:00]  talking about it  but none mention  the doctor's name  oh ok well maybe  you could just  you know  or whatever  where'd he go  he hung up  maybe they just  they're talking to  Brent in Kansas City  hello Brent  how are you  oh mighty fine  I'm pretty much  a normal guy  I would say  been married  you know about  6 years  but I kind of  turn into a creep  in my sleep  especially when  I'm really tired  and I bug my wife  I kind of  grope on her 
[03:17:30]  and sometimes  try to have sex  with her  and I'm  completely  sleeping  well I don't  think that's  making you a  creep dude  I mean that's  what's so bad  about that  I mean you know  well I guess  it annoys her  well so why  are you a creep  maybe she's just  a stick in the mud  no she's  she's actually  great about it  but I think  the thing that  makes me feel  creepy is  is I don't  necessarily realize  what's going on  but I get that  I can remember  a little bit of it  in the morning  and man 
[03:18:00]  it's just  phew  I'm all fired up  and apparently  just go in and out  like I'll get it  started and maybe  that's why she  doesn't like it  because I don't  I don't follow  through  oh you just  give her a couple  of fucking  quick pumps  and then you  roll back over  right  yeah I don't  think that makes  you a pervert  maybe you're  one of those  guys that has  vivid dreams  there's people  that sleepwalk  and everything  you sleep fuck  I think that's  pretty enviable  that's pretty  enviable my friend  I just wish I could  carry over the  intensity or something  like that man  it just 
[03:18:30]  well you don't  know what you're  doing you're  sleeping so just  enjoy it  let her deal  with it  tough titty  that's what I  say  alright thank you  sir  good luck  let's see  Troy in Iowa  42 having a  hard time  finding a girl  hi Troy  how are you  hey Jimmy  how's it going  I'm good buddy  thank you  would really love  it if you could  come to Iowa  someday  maybe I will  a Tumwa Iowa  because I want to  perform for  Radar O'Reilly  for MASH  go ahead  that's down in  a Tumwa yeah  what's that 
[03:19:00]  down in a Tumwa  Iowa yeah  what I just  wanted to  like I said  I've been  married twice  been divorced  twice  I got four  kids  two grandkids  my youngest  is 16  but I'm a  truck driver  as well  and I'm  kind of  addicted to  computer games  so I spend  a lot of  my time  buying  computer screen  playing games  stuff like  that  and my  daughter  my oldest  daughter  is always  yelling at  me  dad  you need  to find 
[03:19:30]  somebody  my mom  is telling  me  she needs  to find  somebody  but  I've  gone to  the bar  thing  I've tried  the bar  thing  tried to  meet  girls  and  it's  just  I'm tired  of the  rejection  you know  what I mean  oh god  yeah  of course  I mean  it's about  all I ever  get  so I  just wanted  to know  you know  you've seen  the commercials  for mash.com 
[03:20:00]  whatever  those other  places  are those  actual  legitimate  places  or are they  just a place  that takes  your email  you know  what I mean  right right  right  sends it off  to the porn  sites  well  starting  what you  should do  is this  I can't  speak for  mash.com  I've never  been on it  but from  what I hear  it's a legit  site  again  pardon me  for your  I don't  know  what  the success 
[03:20:30]  rate is  but I've  heard a lot  of people  who've met  on mash.com  what's the  other one  Cupid  or there's  JDate  eHarmony  eHarmony  there's so  many dating  sites  what have  you lost  if you  don't do  it  and you're  lonely  then you  lose  something  but if  you try  it  you don't  lose  anything  by trying  it  the money  if you  can part  with the  money  and if  you're worried  about your  email address  just create  a new  email address  so if it's  all spam  and garbage  you don't have  to have your  real email  affected by it  yeah  but I would 
[03:21:00]  give it a shot  dude  especially if  you're on  the road  a lot  you know  I think  these dating  sites are  actually great  because  you don't  have to  truck to a  bar and  drunk drive  home  and for  women it's  amazing because  you could weed  through all  these guys  I think  sometimes it  makes us  too selective  because we  have so many  options  it's all  this virtual  just a face  just a face  but I think  it's pretty  healthy to do  it and I don't  think there's  anything wrong  with it  so why not  give it a shot  join one or two  of the sites  all right  I'll give it  a try  thanks Jimmy  okay buddy 
[03:21:30]  take care  hi John  in Oklahoma  how are you  doing Jimmy  how are you  kind of  concerned about  something  I found out  Monday night  my girlfriend  was talking  to me  said her  13 year old  niece  watched her  give me heads  Saturday night  yay  and I haven't  been back home  since then  I had to leave  out Sunday night  but it's  just gonna be  kind of awkward  going back there 
[03:22:00]  to me  why I mean  you know  it's  look at least  it's not the  reverse  that would be  really awkward  I don't know  if that's that  awkward  I mean  maybe you know  like kids  once in a while  will peak  I would say  be more careful  next time  and be aware  that she might  try to sneak  down so maybe  you lock the  room you're in  door  but hey look  man you did  a healthy  normal thing  and she did  something pretty  normal by  peaking  I think that  that's something  we all try to  do when we're  younger  so just think  it's a normal  part of  development  for her  to be curious  just you know  be really careful  now so she  can't do that 
[03:22:30]  again  well that's  that's just it  this woman  this woman  loves suck a  dick  I mean  it's brand new  to me  I was married  for 42 years  sure  and my girlfriend  is 25 years  younger  wow  hell  she's younger  than my daughter  you know  and I'm just  getting kind of  awkward  around my kids  and then  this on top  of it  I'm like  Jesus Christ  how weird  do you gotta  make this  for me  yeah  no I know 
[03:23:00]  that's a little  bizarre  but don't feel  awkward dude  you didn't do  anything wrong  you didn't do  anything wrong  it's not like  you tried to  get the girl  to watch  like you  didn't know  she was  watching  so now  that you  know  you'll just  be more  careful  next time  you did  nothing wrong  so you  shouldn't  feel  awkward  and you  should  just get  your  fucking  hog  sucked  by this  good egg  that you're  dating  enjoy it  it's all  new to me  I'm back  to me  having a kid  in the house  again  I didn't even  know she was  there until  the next day  I mean  we went out 
[03:23:30]  on a date  and her niece  was there by  herself  to come find out  ok well  now that you're  aware of it  be more careful  that's all you  can do  you can't  change that  she saw it  you know  so she saw  you be more  aware  or else  like when you  know the  niece is in  the house  just  talk really  loud on the  phone  and say  me and my  girlfriend  are going to  hang out  I hope  some nosy  whore  doesn't  peak  have a good  one  alright man  enjoy  let's see  here  here's a guy 
[03:24:00]  Michael from  Michigan  is saying  eHarmony  worked for him  Mike  hey Jimmy  hello buddy  hey  just wanted to  tell that  other caller  hopefully  he's still  listening  of course  he is  why wouldn't  he be  this is  appointment  radio  alright  yeah  I went  on eHarmony  I had to  kiss a lot  of pigs  lol  but eventually  I found a girl  that I really  fell in love  with and  I'm going to  be getting  engaged to her  here probably 
[03:24:30]  within the next  month or so  so tell them  it works  when it works  when you  you know  you're looking  for like-minded  people with  the long-term  relationship goals  I tried the  match.com thing  and that was  more like a  hook-up thing  and casual dating  more than  I think  the eHarmony  hat  the eHarmony  thing is more  for actual  relationships  oh yeah  oh yeah  hell yeah  okay well  that's great  though I  think it's  really good  that you  at least  you know  it worked  for you  good for  you man  it's nice  to know 
[03:25:00]  and yeah  I don't think  there's anything  to lose  by getting  a profile  and putting  it up  and seeing  how it goes  I mean  the worst  that can  happen  is you  don't meet  somebody  but there's  enough people  there that I  think the odds  are you will  meet somebody  or I don't know  what it is  poke somebody  get a response  you know  give a wink  who knows  yeah  yeah  but yeah  I mean  it's  you know  that I mean  the worst  thing that  happened to me  on eHarmony  is I got to  meet and fuck  a bunch of  different people  before I landed  on my future  fiance  excellent  good good 
[03:25:30]  alright buddy  good luck man  I'm happy for you  thank you sir  have a good one  alright thank you  Tony in North Carolina  you want to talk to me  about your favorite  tranny  hello Tony  hey Jimmy  what's going on  I'm good buddy  how are you  good thank you  so I was just  calling upon it  who your favorite  trannies were man  tough question  it's like saying  what's your favorite  place to smile  what's your favorite  place to eat an orange  and enjoy the laughter  of a child  oh there's so many  Eva Lynn 
[03:26:00]  who did my special  she was the transsexual  that I made out  with in my special  I know her as a person  she's a really cool  person  of course  the lovely  Bailey J  yeah  how do you not  love Bailey J  she's terrific  I would venture  to say that if  someone doesn't  like Mia Isabella  they're a communist  that would be  my opinion  Mia Isabella  is a very popular  porn star  but probably  Bailey J  who I know  better than I know  anybody else 
[03:26:30]  Vanity was a  friend of mine  who I knew for years  I just haven't seen  her in a long  long time  so I would have to  say Bailey  excellent  okay cool man  thanks  yeah Bailey or  Evelyn  take care  bye you too  bye  let's see  oh my god  let's talk to  Lucky Trucker  John in Oregon  Lucky Duck  your name should be  hi John  hey Jimmy  love you man  thank you buddy  I'm going to get  back up to the  Pacific Northwest  I have not seen  your show  one of your shows  that I want  to see you live  I want to get out 
[03:27:00]  to Seattle again  and I'd like to do  Portland again  but I didn't draw  great  I did okay  in the club  like you know  it was half full  so I'm like  maybe Oregon  just doesn't like  Jim Norton  no that's not it  Jimmy  the last two times  you went up to  Seattle  you went on  major holiday  weekends  or just before  and everybody  up here goes  camping  or goes out  of town  oh okay  you can't hit  on one of those  major holidays  yeah I know  I have bad timing  sometimes  so your wife  now your wife  is going to turn  50 soon  she wants to  hit you with a  strap on  instead of you 
[03:27:30]  doing it to her  well yeah  I mean you know  we've been married  twice a time  and she says  you know I think  it's time that I  she's going to  venture out  she and her  girlfriends  are thinking about  going and getting  one of those  strap on  and what not  anyway I know  you've had a little  experience with this  and it didn't work  out too well  but what are the  pitfalls I need  to watch out for  now real quickly  to tell you  I've had a lot  of frosted exams  on 51  and so I have  no problem  with you know  weird entry  into that  okay  but you know 
[03:28:00]  I'm afraid  that she's going to  like I'm going to  take this out  on him  I'll tell you  the problem  you're gay  no I'm kidding  but that's what  our mind tells us  we want something  in our ass  oh my god  am I gay  it's  you know  I would suggest  this  no I know you  know I can tell  I would say  if her reasons  for doing it  are just because  it's dirty  and fun  then you should  try it  you know  if she wants  to pay you  back  and motherfuck  you I wouldn't  do it  just make sure 
[03:28:30]  the only pitfall  is you don't want  to fucking have her  pull it out  and have an  Abe Lincoln hat  on it  make sure you  make sure you  make sure you  fucking  you know  your enema  you clean out  your asshole  I would suggest  you wash out  your asshole  first with a good  enema  and then just  let her go to it  go slow  and have fun  I think I'll  probably end up  doing that  get Eros Lube  it's also called  Pure  P-J-U-R  is a brand  I like  and that will  help  you could  literally  you could  slip a fucking 
[03:29:00]  tire iron  sideways  into your  asshole  with that  lube  it's the  best  so I would  suggest that  okay  is this  going to  turn me  on a  tranny  I'm  fearful  no not  necessarily  I mean  trannies  are really  it's almost  like here's  what transsexuals  are to a  strap on  if like  if all of a  sudden  you're driving  a kit car  and you're  like I  gotta have  the real  Porsche  that's what  a transsexual  is the  real thing  and a  fucking  you know  a strap  on is the  kit car  so give  the kit car  a run  and see  how you  like it  first  alright 
[03:29:30]  Jimmy I love  you man  get back  up here  alright  trucker  John  good luck  my friend  alright  bye  okay  Biff in  New York  now has  a girlfriend  that dumped  him and she  won't talk  to you and  you think  she might  be knocked  up  hello  Biff  hey  what's  going on  Jimmy  man  I don't  need  ass  move  but it's  a pretty  simple  thing  the girl  caught me  cheating  man  and I'm  fucked  how long  were you  with her  I was with her  for a year  and a half  man  and she  caught me  cheating  at her  brother's  birthday  dinner  man  oh no  she  physically  caught you  at the  dinner  well  the chick  I was  cheating  on her 
[03:30:00]  with  showed  up  to the  fucking  dinner  wow  on purpose  or by  mistake  by mistake  it was a  surprise  dinner  and I  was the  guy  you know  fooling  her brother  into the  surprise  and when I  got there  I sweated  and everybody  made fun of  me  and took  pictures  and made  it obvious  and then  you know  when I  got out  of there  she put  two and  two  together  and I  was  fucked  oh okay  so you  really  humiliated  her  in front  of your  did your  brother's  family  all know  that you  were  cheating  um 
[03:30:30]  I think  so  that's  kind of  because  that's  not just  being  betraying  her  that's  humiliating  her  and she  probably  feels  betrayed  by all  of them  for laughing  at her  or she  probably  feels  like a  fool  that's  a really  tough  one  have you  tried to  talk to  her  she won't  talk to  you  I'm calling  her  I'm texting  emailing  she's not  telling me  anything  I mean  if it's  over  it's over  I don't  give a shit  it's just  a pregnancy  thing  I can't  focus  well why  do you  think  she might  be  pregnant  because  I keep  hitting  it raw  every time 
[03:31:00]  and I  fucking  talk with  myself  and she  didn't tell  me last  she had  her period  it was  like that's  the kind  of time  she stopped  talking  well I  maybe you  should give  her some  time  again I  don't know  her so I  don't know  if she's  she might  be done  with you  dude  she might  have been  that might  be a  humiliation  that's  unforgivable  or how  long were  you seeing  the other  girl  in all  honesty  what was 
[03:31:30]  your other  thing  with the  other  girl  probably  two  years  longer  than  her  oh you  were cheating  the whole  time you  were together  yeah I  mean yeah  but the  other girl  lived in  Florida  so it  doesn't even  count  cheating  I  feel  when I  go  forward  was that  the only  time you  cheated  or no  yeah  between us  between us  and everybody  listening  yeah I  don't know  brother I  would suggest  giving her  space  you're emailing  her you're  blowing her  phone up  you know you've  probably said 
[03:32:00]  what you have  to say  you're sorry  you wouldn't  do it again  you fucked  up  there's probably  not anything  you're going  to say that's  new  maybe if you  want to send  one and go  look this  will be the  last one I  send to you  out of  respect  for your  space  and your  privacy  I know  you're  processing  this  I know  I humiliated  you and I'm  really sorry  like all you  can do is be  very very  forthcoming  and truthful  and then if  she goes  dude and if  she says  fuck you  maybe you  gotta respect  that because  you really  did kind of  douche her  that's that 
[03:32:30]  yeah I do  but you know  I do one of  those fucking  warry black  guy dances  if I find  out she's  not pregnant  like if I  see a picture  of her pregnant  in a month  I'd shit  myself  but I'd be  really happy  if she's  not  what was the  name of that  you just told  that dude  though  at least we're  gonna have  priority strength  it's called  Eros  I see you're  well on your  way to recovery  sir  I would say  Eros  is the lube  or it's called  Pure  P-J-U-R  is another  name for it 
[03:33:00]  there's all  different kinds  but I think  the body glide  is the best  one okay buddy  hey Jimmy  one more  question  sure Ben  you know  I'm hosting  Patrice O'Neal's  show with  Vondi Carlo  I'd love to  have your  opinion on it  I'm not  opinion on it  I'd love to have  you featured on  the show man  can I get in  contact with you  yeah therealjimnorton  at gmail.com  is an email  address I check  I don't check  it every day  but therealjimnorton  at gmail  okay buddy  all right  so I'm gonna  be good  take care  let's see  Joey in  New Jersey  you're sober  three years  and you went 
[03:33:30]  on vacation  with your  college buddies  how do I  deal with  people drinking  hi Joe  hey Jimmy  how are you  good good  let me ask you  now you're  sober three years  just say  do you do  any 12 step  work  yeah I do  about three  or four  meetings a week  I've gone  through all  the steps  I have a  sponsor  now how long  were you going  away with your  college buddies  for  I was away  for a week  with them  these are guys  I used to be  pretty active  with  sure  they are still  active  but you know  we have families  now so you know 
[03:34:00]  I kind of throw  myself into the  kids and  but it's difficult  at night when the  kids go to bed  none of them are  sober huh  yeah it's almost  like there's no  connection anymore  yeah do they know  that you're sober  yes  now a couple of  things are possible  here as you know  like one did you  talk to your  sponsor before and  during your time  out I did you  know he always  says you know  make sure you  don't get stuck in  a situation you  can't get out of  right sure you  know if you don't 
[03:34:30]  want to be a part  of it just go to  bed but then you  feel kind of like a  loser all the  time going to bed  when everybody's  hanging out  true but you  feel like a bigger  loser when you  fucking when you  have blue and red  flashing lights and  you're cuffed and  you don't remember  what you did like  you feel like a  bigger loser  fucking uh  barreling into an  old woman crossing  the street because  you're in a blackout  like the idea of  feeling like a and  I know what you  mean too I'm not  shitting on you  because you feel  like ah fuck I'm  missing the party and  like I'm different 
[03:35:00]  than them but you  have taken something  that was ruining your  life and put it  down they may or  may not have a  problem with it but  I would look at what  they're doing as  playing Russian roulette  and you've just  opted not to play  anymore so if it's  too much for you and  it's too uncomfortable  then the priority  should be your life  and your family don't  go or is it  possible to sneak  out and hit a  meeting or tell  them that's what  you're doing or if  the bond is not  there can you go  just for a day or 
[03:35:30]  two instead of a  week yeah usually  when I go away I  make sure I hit  meetings and this  time I didn't and  I you know as soon  as I got back I hit a  meeting I felt better  you know I try not  to I try not to  throw myself pity  parties because I  know exactly what  you're saying is the  truth it's just not  for me anymore and I  know where it leads  to you know institutions  and sure death and  fucking in prison yeah  well you have to you  you you've made the  right move I know how  awkward it can be  sometimes if we're  around like I'm so 
[03:36:00]  used to it I'm sober  for so long and in  my business that  everyone drinks and  you know it's very  rare that it will  catch me off guard  and I'll feel awkward  but I do understand  that and hey man at  least you feel  uncomfortable that's a  good sign I always  think it's a good  sign like you know  when I did Rogan and  Kevin Smith's podcast  they both smoke a lot  of pot and Joe's  like I'll leave the  room and I'm like  no no man I'll leave  I'll walk and he  left the room and I  can still smell it  I was like oh fuck  that smells good but  thank God I was not  in the room with him  I still can't handle 
[03:36:30]  being in the room for  certain things like  pot I'll never be able  to be in the room for  because you smell it  so alcohol is slightly  more comfortable for  me because of my job  and I'm used to it  but I think the  uncomfortability is a  good thing and you  know what maybe you  might have to make a  choice one day that  this is just not the  scene for you anymore  yeah I agree I'm not  in the situation much  anymore but whenever I  am I'm uncomfortable  and I don't you know  rush to put myself back  in it  yeah because dude if  the bond how long 
[03:37:00]  you had a college  10 years  yeah like you had a  bond with those guys  if they're all still  drinking maybe it's  time for you just not  to go to that event  or maybe you do like  I said you just go for  a day or two because  the price you could pay  by fucking up is  ruining a great life  that you're building  for yourself and it's  not worth it for a  bunch of people some  of who will probably  wind up in the room  someday anyway  yeah I agree  you know so be good  buddy okay and at 
[03:37:30]  least you're concerned  that's that's good  that's a good sign  yeah have a great  weekend good luck buddy  okay bud you too  thanks hi jay in  new jersey a sex addict  cannot stop paying  for pussy  hey um jimmy I  called you up a few  weeks ago remember  I was talking to you  about the strip club  and how I was going  there like three times  a week and I wanted  to go less and you  would tell me that  doesn't replace like a  real uh interaction  with a girl  right yeah sure  well I've definitely  gotten better at doing  that I've gotten it  down to like once 
[03:38:00]  every other week or  if I really have to  like once a week and  I'm making decent  money so it's not that  bad as long as I don't  do that but I still  like notice that it's  like I'm at my job  because I'm a security  guard I have a lot of  free time and I work  in a car and I just  eat hot clothes going  in and out of the  store and that's like  not that bad as long  as I stay entertained  if I listen to you or  if I go on the  internet but once like  if my mind slips and  I start thinking about  it too much then I  notice that it's just  right to like back  page dot com and I'm  I'm trying to like 
[03:38:30]  look up like um  oriental massage places  where they do like  happy endings and all  that stuff sure it's so  quick how my mind when  it gets bored when like  I think about the fact  that I'm not with  someone I could just  slip into that  automatic like let me  find a way to get off  you know what I mean  yeah of course I do it  I was in it I was in  it last night even if  I'm not going to do  anything I'm just  looking around and  it's such a hard thing  in this day and age  with the internet  because you can just  it's like if you say  you're a compulsive 
[03:39:00]  overeater it's like  it's like literally  having a supermarket  with you all the time  that's what it's like  with the internet  because you just  fucking pick up your  iPad or your phone  and sometimes out of  boredom we just start  looking what helps me  do let me ask you do  you play like it  sounds corny but like  words with friends  chess with friends  scramble these online  games at times not  that that's a complete  replacement but  sometimes it is a  distraction if you  have a shitload of  games that are going  on or scrabble or 
[03:39:30]  something that can be  a nicer distraction  can you put an  internet blocker on  the phone I'm sorry  an adult porn blocker  on the computer you  are using  I don't think  a tablet but like  most of the time  like you said there  is other things to  do I don't have a  lot of friends anymore  because I used to  smoke pot and I used  to drink and that was  a couple years ago so  I'm still trying to make  like a new circle of  healthy friends to  have and so like I'll  just watch like  different things online  or I'll listen to you  guys and that will  usually be enough to 
[03:40:00]  take my mind off it  but once I stop doing  those things then it's  right to the other  stuff if I let my mind  kind of like roam  inside itself yeah and  it's not even like even  when I go to these  places that I could just  get the massage and the  handjob it's like then  it turns into well how  much would it be for a  blowjob and how much  would it be to fuck you  like and I'm I'm  dropping a hundred dollars  but I could only be  spending like 50 for a  half an hour yeah that  that's better but I  think you know what I  mean it's like a  slippery slope once  you're once you're in  the place it's like it's  time to bargain well  it's not about the  money there what it's  about is the ritual and 
[03:40:30]  the behavior like looking  on back page even when  you know like I'm  probably not going to  do anything tonight but  I'm just looking I'm  going through the ritual  of looking the whole  behavior and pattern is a  part of it's not just  orgasming or getting  jerked off it's looking  it's choosing it's the  drive-in that fucking  flutter in your heart it's  the smell of ammonia on  the floor when you walk  in they all smell like  ammonia like peep shows  and stuff because you  know guys are jacking  off on the floor women  are jerking them off or  whatever it is so it's 
[03:41:00]  that whole ritual the  bargaining the what can I  get how far can I go and  it's a very very difficult  pattern to break but I  can tell you from  experience it never gets  better it never like  there's times where I  still enjoy the jerking  off and the porn but  dude 90% of the times it  is lonely and it doesn't do  anything for me and you  know try meeting some  real like you know those  match.com sites we were  talking about and why  don't you do you have a  girlfriend no why don't  you try one of them or 
[03:41:30]  try e-harmony because a  you'll save a lot you'll  save a lot of money all  that money you're wasting  the strip clubs and you  might actually meet a  girl who can occupy you  and talk dirty to you and  have fun with within a real  situation it's funny that  you should mention that  because I'm on plenty of  fish I'm on a lot of  these sites and a lot of  times I don't do that  well but yesterday when I  had that urge and I was  on backpage.com I just  told myself not to do it  because I knew I know the  cycle that I go through 
[03:42:00]  yeah I do and then I have  guilt afterwards and I'm  broke and I'm thinking  about the fact well if I  did go on a date now the  money that I wasted on  that and then I got a  budget so I ended up not  doing it and I just went  back to entertaining  myself and by the end of  the day I was in a couple  conversations on plenty of  fish and I actually was  talking with this girl that  I met at a supermarket a  few days before so it  seemed as if the energy of  making a good choice  earlier that day kind of  like paid off because now  if I do end up actually  going out one of those  girls at least I'll have  the money you know 
[03:42:30]  yeah and also part of us  and thank you very much for  the call Jay good luck  okay buddy part of us likes  to stay sick there is a  part of us that likes to  stay sick and unhealthy and  in the addiction so we  we sabotage healthier  things and I know I do  it so instead of saying  I'm going to go out with  this girl your mind starts  bargaining with you all  the money and this and  that and you do strip  clubs will be there if you  were to die and come back  in 600 years through some  kind of a fucking frozen  head Ted Williams thing 
[03:43:00]  strip clubs will be there  the experiences that you're  losing out on are the real  life experiences the strip  club the jerking off the  pornography the whores are  always going to be  available it's amazing how  we sacrifice real things  which we can lose for  bullshit which is never  going to change so just  give yourself a chance keep  trying with real girls and  I'm going to talk to this  guy Steve from Alabama in  just a minute I want to do  a quick read first but  Steve in Alabama who was  married and caught your

[03:45:00]  heard nothing but good things  about that site so Steve from  Alabama hi Steve you recently  married seven weeks in your  wife's cheating buddy yeah  Jimmy it's kind of kind of sad  really but I'll tell you real  quick what happened I run I have  a rescue down here for animals and  we were in an adoption about two  weeks ago and she was talking to  some folks and it's no big deal  well the following Monday I get  some text come across my phone and 
[03:45:30]  what happened was the dumbass that  she was going to be cheating with  got the numbers mixed up and was  sending them to me oh boy oh what I  did what I did was I called a friend  and asked if they would help me so I  would send the messages to them they  would forward them to her okay so we  had a little square going they talked  for 10 days oh wait so she was  talk hold on she was talking oh I see 
[03:46:00]  so basically she gave her number to  somebody or both numbers he's  texting you your friend is texting  her from his number right well no  she didn't have his number which  that's that's what made it work  okay right right no his number so she  didn't realize it was your friend and  not the guy she thought right so we  you know we just kind of I just  wanted to see what where this was  going to lead to so we we kind of  played this box game for 10 days and  she was sending pictures and all this 
[03:46:30]  shit and then they were going to you  know talk about hooking up and  everything and she actually did not  but to my knowledge physically talk  to him but the opportunity and  everything was there and she was  going to but I called her on it about  two weeks ago and what was her  response that she was sorry of  course and you know never going to do  it again and I was her reason for  doing well let me ask you now is she a  cheater or was she panicking because  she just got married because like a 
[03:47:00]  lot of times people I think get  married and panic at the finality of  it I don't think so I mean we've you  know we were together about nine  nine months before we got married but  I've known her for about four three to  four years  I don't make her feel sexy I'm not  blaming you either but do you make  feel sexy and do you go down or I  mean you know oh yeah I do  everything okay anything and I you  know I think the the I just don't  think I was able she's the type of  person who the amount of attention 
[03:47:30]  you have to give her has to be  everything 24 hours a day and I'm  I'm affectionate and you know you  know like that but I can't do it for  24 hours a day I mean I just I'm not  that you know I got other things I got  to do and I just can't sit around and  hold you all day you know of course  not dude she's obviously says she  sounds codependent and needy and does  she work she does work yeah she works  and and you've talked to what do you  want to do do you want to stay with I  mean you're early enough into the  marriage where you could probably could 
[03:48:00]  you get it annulled I mean I don't know  how that works but I mean you obviously  have a reason to get out of it if you  want to get out of it yeah and the  thing is I mean I don't wish her any  ill will or anything sure but I I just  don't think I can be married to her  anymore I don't think I can trust her I  mean after seven weeks in yeah maybe  you got lucky dude maybe you got lucky  in a sick way like you don't have two  kids with her you know you're not 10  years deep because let's just say she  got away with this you know she'd  probably do it again so maybe you got a  fucking an early warning sign and you 
[03:48:30]  can get out of it now with a minimal  amount of pain compared to what you  would have dealt with well that's my  initial reaction is that I just know I  just need to get out of it and I just  know I like I said I just don't think  I can trust her in the future I mean  she didn't know this guy from Adam  you know what I mean they just  happened to meet and at the at the  event we were having and next thing I  know he's sending her to text how he  wants to fuck her so so maybe she 
[03:49:00]  intrigues with people have you did she  have a passcode on her phone no she  didn't know have you looked through her  phone now why don't you look through  her phone I don't think she's doing  anything now because she wants me back  me like does she have any old text on  there I could check and see yeah I'm  telling you what maybe she just  intrigues maybe she's an intriguer maybe  that's enough for her but if you do  if you're really feeling like you  should leave then maybe you should I  again again it's all depends can you  forgive her or can't you do you love 
[03:49:30]  her enough to overlook this and trust  her if you can't trust her and you  can't forgive her then you shouldn't  be with her I don't think I don't  think I don't think I can trust her  again that's the trust is a key for me  I mean I was married one other time  18 years and we just you know we're  good friends and everything we just  grew apart but sure you know I never  worried about anything like that never  had that happen you know and I just  don't think I can be with someone I  can't trust I think you're right and  maybe you got lucky thank you very  much for the call man I'm sorry that 
[03:50:00]  happened to you maybe you can you know  it sounds like he has his mind made up  Iraq that's what I would think sounds to  me like you're just kind of getting a  final confirmation here that you're  done but if you're done you're done I  mean you wouldn't be a jerk for  leaving but if that's the only thing  she ever did was an intrigue with a  guy she genuinely wasn't gonna fuck I  mean again I don't know I didn't read  the text messages but if you're  finished my friend you might as well get  out early Sam in Florida has been  having a threesome I'll have been this  is ongoing with your your friend and 
[03:50:30]  his wife and things are starting to get  weird how many times have you done it  four times okay now do you fuck both of  them or just her just her and he'd  blow me like he's like he really gets  off watching me fuck car because I mean  I'm not trying to brag but I'm a solid  thick eight and he's like much smaller  and then it kind of got weird not this  last time at the time before he was like  saying I mean of course we're drinking  and stuff and he's like you know damn  dude you got a nice cock and all that  stuff I was like huh and she had text me 
[03:51:00]  saying before I came over this past  Friday night you know we're all  drinking and stuff she's like yeah he  wants to get freaky tonight I was like  kind of knew where it was going I'm  just not that way sure it might be  some drinks you know after I fucked her  a few times she was down with him I  was blowing me and next thing you know  he slides over and wants to get on it  and he did I was like no it's really  weird I don't know wait a minute you  actually had sex with him or he blew  you he just blew me oh okay I wasn't  sure if it was uh just in fantasy all 
[03:51:30]  right well I mean were you drunk and  was he drunk we're like drunk drunk I  mean I remember everything clearly but  we're all buzzed and uh well let me ask  you something let me I'm sorry to  interrupt you let me ask you now you  knew where this was going you probably  like the idea of being the bull in that  situation you're kind of cuckolding your  friend with his little dick now you  already know he's admiring your dick and  you kind of have a feeling this is  where it's gonna go and she sends you a  text what made you go through with it  if you didn't want to have that  experience I don't I don't that's what 
[03:52:00]  that's what's bothering me about it's  over with I mean I don't I'm feeling  kind of creeped like I can't really look  at him in the eye you know I guess it's  hard to I mean again I don't know I can  understand the dirty fantasy of that I  really can because I'm a pervert and I  can fantasize about most things but the  idea of one of my friends it would be  hard to look at after I can definitely I  guess that would be terribly hard to  look at your friend after but either say  look we did something we chalk it up to  experience I'm not gonna have a threesome 
[03:52:30]  with them again or say look I'll do it  again but I prefer not to do that I don't  want to go in that direction again or  just say fuck it both of you get on my  dick and get to work I mean it was weird  because I was like well when she's like  are you gonna join in I was kind of like  oh shit I knew it I kind of put my head  back close my eyes and they gave me every  time I go they give me a hundred  milligram Viagra that shit lasts like two  days for me yeah grocery store the damn  boner but well don't forget dude you 
[03:53:00]  knew it was gonna happen before you got  there that's why you just threw your  head back and close your eyes you  weren't shocked by that you might have  been a little like oh boy it really is  happening but you knew that was gonna  happen on some level deep down because  the warning signs were there and a part  of you wanted to have that experience or  you wouldn't have like if you were just  having a threesome all of a sudden you  know he's fucking he's fucking you know  throat deep on your dick then you might  be like all right that was a shock  yeah but you wanted to have it it's  all right that you wanted to have it  yeah they're like I mean he's like oh 
[03:53:30]  dude that's cool so he's like I'm on  kush you know and I'm just like uh but  it was just dirty dude you did a dirty  sexual thing and it doesn't make it bad  and he's probably telling you the truth  he doesn't want to kiss you probably the  idea of holding your hand probably makes  him want to puke you know and the idea  is there might be something very hot  about that with the woman involved like  that can be hot this yeah it's the  humiliation it's not even like I think  it's really hot when I'm talking to a  girl and she's telling me about other 
[03:54:00]  guys cocks and how big they are and how  much better the hot part of that is the  woman and the fact that she is being so  dirty and so inappropriate that she is  saying these things that no woman should  be saying if she's decent there's  something so dirty and whorish about a  woman craving that that's what turns me  on it is the woman's energy of it and  the woman being dirty so they may have  that dynamic where that's just what gets  them off but uh hey if you don't want to  do it again don't do it brother I still 
[03:54:30]  want a banger so I guess I'll just talk  to him about that yeah or else just  fucking you know just tell him you know  all right just make sure you shave so I  don't feel scruff on my balls and  asshole all right all right thank you  take care buddy I mean because honestly  if you ask any girl I mean if you say to  any woman what's the best gift you ever  got she's probably gonna say well I was  blowing someone and my husband helped  that's a gift you want to help your  girlfriend out when she's blowing  somebody else get in there and help  give her jaw break but if you're not  willing to do that the second best thing 
[03:55:00]  she's gonna say is her engagement ring  it's very very important it's not just  a ring it's not just a sign of  affection it's everything to her and she  can talk about it she can say like oh  look at the ring he gave me she can't  brag like oh I was blowing his friend  and he came over and he tooted on it  with me she can't tell her friends  that because her friends will laugh at  both of you every time she looks down  at her hand she's gonna think of you  every time she washes her hands after  she's been doing the dishes like the  broad she is she'll be thinking of you 
[03:55:30]  every time she scrubs the toilet every  time she's washing your horrible shit  stains out of the toilet and hating your  guts with a scrub brush she'll look at  that ring on her finger and go oh god I  do love him for a second I was gonna  divorce him because I'm here scrubbing  caked shit off the toilet but then I  realized that this ring this guy loves  me see the ring is always going to come  into play and it's always gonna be good  for you you're gonna get credit for it  it's got to be a perfect ring you don't 
[03:56:00]  want to half-ass it here Stephen Singer  understands this as Stephen Singer  jewelers they have the perfect system to  make sure you get the perfect ring  Stephen knows how important it is and  it's painless now so many of our guys  have made their trip down to Stephen  Singer I think Opie did and Sam did and  Iraq did what the fuck are you waiting  for you go online to I hate Stephen  singer calm or head to a store at the  other corner of eighth and walnut in  Philadelphia Stephen's got a hundred  percent and it's a genuine money-back  guarantee this guy's great you get the 
[03:56:30]  best service best value and the best  experience this is a guy you can trust  with the most important gift you're ever  gonna have or give Stephen singer jewelers  the other corner of eighth and walnut on  the phone at 888 I hate Stephen singer  or online at I hate Stephen singer calm  that's if you don't want to blow somebody  with her if you but all you can do both  like you could get her a ring from a  Stephen singer jewelers then help her suck  a dick and kiss the ring and go  Stephen singer and she go God you're  amazing I thought you were bisexual or  maybe even gay and just marrying me to 
[03:57:00]  cover up for your own fears of being  homosexual but you're just a good guy  all right we have time for one more  here let's see oh Joe in New York your  wife had a flame with a co-worker  they're still together oh boy that  sucks how you doing Joe  thank you buddy so listen we're pressed  for time it was your co-worker or hers  her co-worker we've been together since  we're in high school you know did all  the right things got married had a kid  bought a house guess is that my wife  has never been with anybody else oh boy 
[03:57:30]  okay you know year after six months  after our son was born she started an  affair three months later she got found  out the guy was married to with couple  kids he's a predominant figure in the  small town we live in okay next police  officer you know and and so you know  obviously that was tough to swallow and  deal with and six months after the  affair I was thinking maybe they were  still communicating with you know  because how scandalous they were to to  have what they had the trust was out 
[03:58:00]  the window but I wasn't ready to let  go because you want to forgive you  take somebody's body work and say it  was one time you know everybody makes  a mistake in life have you have you  ever cheated have you ever cheated on  her yeah prior to our marriage oh yeah  oh yeah you know she was in college  yeah yeah you have oh yeah yeah and I  understand that I look at myself in the  full-length mirror and say you know  nobody's perfect but the problem that  really hurt my psyche but six months  afterwards I'm saying are you still  seeing him are you meeting him are you 
[03:58:30]  talking to him no no no no two days  after Valentine's Day the wife of the  other guy texted me late at night  said you are crazy she was drinking  that night finally wanted to get the  cat out of the bag because you were  crazy they were talking they were  meeting at this park or that park they  both swear up and down it was just to  conversate about how much they have  affected each other's life and their  family I have a hard time you know  believing that but then again maybe  the lust was out the window after they  got caught now that's bullshit dude  your instincts I think are right the 
[03:59:00]  bottom line is she was lying to you  after she got caught cheating tough  shit if she needs to talk to him about  if she's worried about affecting her  family or he's worried about affecting  it then they wouldn't be doing it they  wouldn't be doing it after they got  caught so the point is you were right  your instincts were right she was  lying to you now maybe they weren't  fucking but probably they were but if  they weren't either way she was lying  to you again so if you can forgive her  and trust her fine but I think it 
[03:59:30]  would be tough after you've caught her  and she still continued to do it  right right I mean that was back in  November the wife didn't tell me until  February that they stopped talking in  November she found out with a tape  recorder he took her vehicle they were  talking for you know whenever they got  a chance but now I'm not you know  obviously don't really know the  details but so since November there's  not been an occurrence where you know I  found out that they were still  communicating I'm trying to move  forward with it like I said you know I  come from nothing I have a house I don't  want to fucking go through I'm 33 sure 
[04:00:00]  if I could find a way that I can  believe her again and feel like this is  just a nice late incident finally over  maybe she needed closure I don't know I've  you know I've tried to analyze it and  put myself in her shoes as angry as I am  with her I try to understand it but you  think mentally this is something that you  think you put yourself in the shoes or  any man even without evidence of being  anything more I have a hard time every  day sure like you know is it not not  having resentment trying to feel you  know now you know love is just a 
[04:00:30]  fucking it's not you know there's no  romance there there's no passion there  it's just you know basically to get out  the police and Joe Joe I got to cut you  off only because we're running up against  a clock which is not our choice because  the great Ron and Fez are next but I  will say thank you for the call and  listen I don't think you should stay  married to somebody just because you  guys have a house if you love her and  want to forgive her and think you can  then stay together but if you're like  fuck her she's a twat she cheated and  then lied and we have a house then  fuck her fight it out for the house or 
[04:01:00]  split it 50-50 and boot the bitch you  know but you have to realize do I want  to stay with her or don't I it really is  that simple so you have to make up that  decision tomorrow we have another advice  show which is great look a great look  fucking asshole trying to be a radio  guy oh whatever see tomorrow  Jim Norton is now done dealing with  your bullshit he'll be back next  Wednesday at 10 a.m. Eastern 7 Pacific  but you listen to episodes of the Jim  Norton show whenever you want to go to
